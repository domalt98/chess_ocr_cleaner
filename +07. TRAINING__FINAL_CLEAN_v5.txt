2205. The second year brought me up to 2458 .

During the past five years, I have made chess my priority over other hobbies (often), friends (more often) and school (always). However, I have often found myself coaching rather than playing. In 2011 - 1 2, I lived and worked as a coach in Kristiansund, Norway, and had the chance to teach the methods I propose. In that way, I could see which parts the students understood and which parts had to be explained in other ways. Thus, those students have helped me with the book, as has every student I have coached over the years. At the time of writing, I have moved back to Lund in Sweden, but I am still coaching the Swedish and Norwegian National Junior Teams from time to time. I spend more energy coaching than playing, and even though I have not made any GM norms (yet), I am happy about the three norms that Nils Grandelius and Aryan Tari achieved when I was their second. There are also a lot of other people to thank. Jesper Hall was my first coach when I started to play chess, and his pedagogical approach has been an important source of inspiration. In the final phase of writing, he read the whole draft and gave me a lot of advice. Hakan Lyngsjo has helped me extensively with the language; my last name is English but it was 400 years ago one of my ancestors left Scotland to try his luck as a gardener in Sweden. There are also many friends who have read what I have written and given fruitful feedback: Stellan Brynell, Nils Grandelius, Andreas Skytte Hagen, )ens Karlsson, Brede Kvisvik, Silas Lund, Sebastian Nilsson, Henrik Olsson, Daniel Semcesen, Aryan Tari, Hans Tikkanen, Michael de Verdier and Patrik Ohagen. I have to thank Quality Chess for believing in the idea, and last but not least my wife, for accepting everything I do, like writing all night.

Mter collecting examples over several years, and writing for the last year, I have finally reached the goal of my five years with chess. I understand that most readers will not be able to find the same amount of time, but I hope that this book will encourage more people to study chess. Nothing is more fascinating.

Appendix- Databases 367 Appendix- Endgames Name Index Introduction This book is mainly for the ambitious player, but don't let the word ambition frighten you! It only means that you really want to improve. My ambition is to teach you what you need to get started; the book is both about "thinking chess" and about practising chess. And I do mean "thinking chess" not "thinking about chess" - in the same way that "speaking English'' and "speaking about English" are different things. Fulfilling these two aims obviously can't be done without showing a lot of instructive games. Since our game is universal, players of different strength can learn from the same examples. I have strived to explain in a way that makes the annotations understandable, but still not too simple. In 2006, when I switched from being a human to being a chess player, I worked through 26 chess books from cover to cover. But somehow I arrived at the conclusion that improving at chess requires more active learning than what is possible by simply reading. My approach became to look for moves rather than generalizing them into verbal rules, and it worked well. It would not be the best selling point to claim that reading books is unnecessary, but luckily, I don't claim that. Firstly, this book contains a fair share of exercises, forcing your brain to work with the material. Secondly, I think there are some rules of thumb and thinking techniques that you need to learn before working by yourself I refer to sayings like "Put your rook on the same file as the opponent's queen", and methods like candidate moves, blunder checks and critical positions. The first question is whether rules of thumb and thinking techniques are useful at all. I found an extensive debate about this while I was finishing this book and got myself up to date on the latest chess literature of the last few years. Willy Hendriks takes the most extreme position in Move First, Think Later (20 12). He argues that there's nothing but concrete moves; Alexander Kotov's mechanical variation trees, from Think Like a Grandmaster (1971), and other thinking techniques are oversimplifying and of no use at the board. Since the debate covers a fundamental view of our game, I think I have to make my position clear. Hendriks' book is a good starting point, since it's fantastically well written. Rules of Thumb Hendriks uses "The best reaction to an attack on the wing is a counterattack in the centre" as an example of a rule of thumb. He writes that the rule is useful for coaches when in hindsight explaining why their students erred, but that it's useless as a prescription when playing. A small statistical research is done to prove his opinion: only in 2 of 34 games was the best reaction to

17. g4 a pawn move in the centre.

Nor is Hendriks delighted with Mark Dvoretsky's modification, that an unprepared wing attack should be met by a timely counterblow in the centre. Such conditions transform the rule to a truism, in the end not saying more than "If the move is the best, play it!"

I agree with much of his writing, but I think he takes it too far. The rule to "open the centre when the opponent attacks on the wing" is a part of the inner logic of chess. What he doesn't mention in his statistical research is that the players with White also know this rule! White played

17.g4 only when seeing that it doesn't allow action in the centre.

I didn't expect 3.f3 and hadn't examined the lines for many years. During the eleven minutes I spent before deciding to go for this pawn sacrifice, I lost more and more self-confidence. 3 ...e5 tries to pinpoint the weakness White created with f2-f3.

I regretted my last decision and thought: why should I be a coward just because I have been surprised? Then I took the pawn without calculating concretely.

When the move came, I did my best to act unaffected, as if it was part of the plan. After a few minutes I came to my senses and resigned. The following evening was not the nicest I have had. 1-0 The game above is short and annotated from the first until the last move. For the rest of the book, I have focused on the relevant part of the games. Personally, I don't find the game moves interesting if they precede the critical position or come after the relevant explanation, but I have included a few of them for the curious reader. However, those moves are left unannotated. In that way, there is more space left for the relevant game fragments. This game is my insurance against taking myself and everything regarding chess too seriously. How could I, when I lose in ten moves? Introduction 1 3 The reason I use a lot of examples from my own games, or my students and friends, is simply that I know those games best and, of course, since I think they are good examples. Actually, many of the moves I'll show are painful mistakes, like in the game above. For some themes, I have not found any good examples and instead created them mysel£ In those cases, I have tried to keep everything as game-like as possible. The biggest disadvantage with playing a lot of chess is that, inevitably, a lot of great games are forgotten. The game against Oleksienko is neither great, nor easy to forget! However, I think that the mistakes I made in the game will help me to explain three general principles that follow throughout the whole book: Every detail counts It's easy to say that I lost because I blundered a piece, but I think it's possible to learn more from the game. Questions that spring to my mind are: Why did I become nervous when I was surprised in the opening? Why did I let my emotions affect the way I reasoned? In some sense, chess is only about making good moves. At the same time, there are a lot of important internal and external factors. To work with those is important for every ambitious chess player. The first principle that runs throughout the whole book is therefore that every detail counts. Internalizing thinking techniques I have already mentioned this subject above. However, you may have noticed that my intuition was not good enough in the game against Oleksienko. Today, I automatically become extra careful if I feel that I am being influenced by a lot of feelings, and I put more effort into blunder checking. The second principle is to use thinking techniques extensively during a limited period, to internalize it in your intuition. Active learning I believe in learning by doing, which is the third principle that applies throughout the book. To get the most out of the time you devote to chess, you must give maximum effort. For that reason, there are exercises in every chapter. When I learned the variation with 3 ...e5 that I played against Oleksienko, I had only read about it in a book. I studied passively without questioning anything or analysing on my own. It's hardly surprising that I had problems remembering the moves a few years later. I have often tried to discuss the theoretical or philosophical part of chess with strong players, but many of them are simply not interested. I interpret this as another sign that skill should be preferred over knowledge. Strong players are interested in moves and specific evaluations, not general principles. This attitude has given them their strength. I want to present some of those players. They had a strong impact on this book, by being friends and training partners for many years. I have learned a lot from them. 1 4 Pump Up Your Rating Model players When I became serious about chess in 2006, I was lucky to live in Lund, a town with 100,000 inhabitants and many aspiring players. We have trained together, travelled together, won together and lost together. Over a period of four years, six players in Lunds ASK became International Masters and another two became Grandmasters. Nils Grandelius is one of them. Since he will appear with a lot of instructive mistakes in this book, I hasten to say that he is the chess player I admire the most. He has positional understanding like an experienced grandmaster, a divine tactical creativity and an elaborate opening repertoire. He plays the endgame well, can win with the least possible advantage and has a strong mind - keeping motivation through losses and wins. I struggle to understand why he is still below 2600, but I guess that the answer can be found somewhere in the fact that he follows periods of hard work with periods of enjoying life. This is, by the way, also something I admire. Hans Tikkanen is another player with whom I have spent countless hours. For many years, we analysed most of my games together. After an extensive tactical training program, Tikkanen improved 1 00 Elo points during the summer of 20 1 0 and made his three GM norms in seven weeks. Many of the chapters in the book will have a model player. Tikkanen will be presented in Chapter 6, where his secret method is revealed, and Grandelius in Chapter 7, about openings. I have also learned a lot from other players. We have had several training camps in Lund with Peter Heine Nielsen and Ulf Andersson. It's an exceptional experience to see Ulf Andersson analyse. He moves the pieces around, talks about pawn structures, coordination, outposts and disturbances. When he sees a specific pawn structure, he immediately knows where the pieces are better and worse placed. Without hesitation, he refers to games from 40 years back. When everyone else is exhausted, Andersson continues to analyse. His enthusiasm for the game is palpable, as is his knowledge. This is something he has worked out on his own - Ulf Andersson has a unique understanding that is highly esteemed around the world. Three of his games, which he has partly annotated himself, are included in the book. Attitude There is a saying that we all play chess for different reasons, but it's also possible to turn the argument the other way around. All of us like the game and are curious about learning more, all of us appreciate when the pieces suddenly coordinate in an unexpected way and all of us enjoy the feeling when we understand something new. And none of us likes to lose. It's the same with me. I love the game, but even more to win. {Winning is nice partly because it's a way to avoid losing!) The last chapter is titled Attitude. It's a mix of themes, but they have in common that they may stop us from getting the most out of our potential. If l had kept a cool head against Oleksienko, I don't think I would have blundered the piece. Among the themes are: practical tournament tips for the serious player, how to win drawn positions, an appeal against draws, keeping focus and time management. Chess players always have a tendency to end up in time trouble, which reminds me that it's really time to start the book.

Chapter 1 - No Pawn Lever - No Plan 21 White's centre has been destroyed, but so has Black's. Both sides have their assets; White has a strong pawn on c6 and has managed to demolish Black's pawn structure in front of the king, while Black has a strong bishop. The position is dynamically balanced and the game ended in a draw after 48 moves. Instead, White can try another 1 9th move.

White only has one pawn for the exchange, but it's a strong one. If he wants, he can return it with 24.c7 to restore the material balance. The knight on d6 is strong, but since the pawn on e5 is also a slight weakness, White has no way to gain an advantage. In this example, both sides had strong pawn levers to play for. It was a question of time; if Black had been first with ... f6, he would have gained the initiative with his strong bishop on g7.

Black is slightly better with control over the open file, but to get something out of the position, he needs to play with the pawns. Since Black has control of the position, he can choose whether to advance his pawn majority or the pawn minority. However, firstly it's White to move.

This pawn lever weakens the king, but it creates open files for White's pieces. It's seldom good just to defend passively. 25 ... Y"d6 26.fx:e5?

26 ... gxe5 27.Y"f3 Y"e7 28.h3 After a few natural moves, Black has to decide which plan to opt for. To me, it doesn't look realistic to advance the kingside pawns, since it opens the king too much.

29.gfl

With 29.1:'!dl White could also claim an open file. In the endgame, the file furthest away from the king is better in principle, because the entry squares are harder to protect. However, king safety is still a motif, and Black holds a small advantage. Starting with 29 ...b5 Black may hope to divert White's pieces to the queenside, before attacking the king. 29 ... a5 I think it's better to start with 29 ... b5 as 30.'1Wa8t lith? 3 1 .'1Wxa6 doesn't work because 3 1 .. . 1:'!el t wins - a line that shows the difference in king safety.

[diagram]
How should White react on the queenside? I never know in such positions, but I always have the feeling that everyone else knows. When I asked a friend he said exactly the same thing - that he doesn't know but believes that others do. It seems we should not be dejected if we experience that chess is difficult. What I will do instead is to go through all possible reactions, one by one: 1) Leaving the pawns as they stand will not work, since Black can threaten the one on a2. 2) b2-b4 doesn't look good, since White will never be able to coordinate his pieces to advance his pawn majority. If the pawns can't advance, it's just weakening. 3) a2-a4 leaves a pawn undefended. If Black has the time to attack it, with for example ...g6, ... lffg7 and ... l:!e4, b2-b3 may be the only good defending move. Then it's starting to look like White has too many weaknesses. 4) a2-a3 allows the minority attack with ...b5-b4, but White exchanges twice and is left with an isolated passed pawn on b2. One weak pawn is not enough. To win, Black must keep one of his own pawns on the queenside. Instead, Black might go for ... a4 and ...b5, fixing the majority. The pawn on b5 looks as weak as b2, but the important question is whether Black can advance his majority. It seems risky, but if he takes one step at a time with ... g6, ...Qg7, ... h5, ...h4, ...f5, ...g5, it's not clear how White should react. It doesn't seem pleasant.

5) b2-b3 and c3-c4 builds a pawn chain. To make progress, Black can try ...a4. IfWhite doesn't react, he might play ... a3 with a dangerous pawn due to E!:b2-ideas later, or he might play ...axb3 followed by an attack against the b3-pawn. Probably White is better advised to play b3xa4, in a moment when c4 is defended. Some counterplay along the b-file might arise. It's still a mystery to me which is the best option, but none seems pleasant. Let's see how the game continued.

During the tournament I shared an apartment with Grandelius. In the next round, he was paired with Agrest. Early in the game, Agrest played Bg2xc6 to give Grandelius isolated, doubled pawns. He quickly exchanged the dark-squared bishops and methodically fixed the doubled pawns.

The theme should be clear by now - Black is lacking good pawn levers. The best would be to play ...e5, but the pawn on d5 would become too weak. White's long-term plan is to advance the pawn majority on the queenside. Before he did this, Agrest improved his knight with tLlc3-b l -d2-f3-e5 and gained space on the kingside with g2-g3 and h2-h4.

It looks like a Catalan, but actually started as a Semi-Slav. There is no doubt Black wants to achieve the pawn lever ...c5, since it opens the diagonal for the bishop, the c-file for a rook and exchanges the backward c-pawn. With White to move, t2Jb3 would take complete control over c5. I didn't hesitate.

The game started with the usual story. In the diagram position, White dominates the d-file while Black's rook is tied to the defence of the a-pawn. In addition, my seventh rank is weak. White's plan is probably to walk his king to b2 and then open up the kingside in one way or another. However, I was eager to carry out my pawn levers before it was too late. 26 ...h5!? Gaining some space.

At the same time it's a double-edged decision, since ...gxf5 weakens my king. Anyway, I thought that anything was better than waiting for Agrest to stop all my pawn levers, like so many times before.

29.e4!?

Agrest also takes an interesting positional decision. He makes the bishop on c2 passive, but wins a tempo which keeps the position closed until White's king has reached the queenside. 29 •. . .le6 30.'tt> e2

1-0 So far, we have learned that against Agrest, pawn levers are necessary to have a plan at all. How is it against other opponents? Pawn lever and plan can't be synonyms. Two other options are playing with the initiative against uncoordinated pieces, and attacking a chronic weakness. That requires, of course, that the opponent has either badly-placed pieces or a weakness. Do I have to say that Agrest usually avoids both these things? So what is a chronic weakness? It is something that cannot run away easily, such as: A The king A A weak pawn A A weak square The idea is actually similar to lossif Dorfman's Move Search Algorithm, which he presented in The Method in Chess. His idea was to measure the static balance in a position according to the following four factors, in decreasing order of importance: A The king's position A Material A Who has the better position after the exchange of queens? A Pawn formation The player who has a disadvantage concerning the static factors has to play dynamically. Pawn levers are one way of doing so! I want to show a masterpiece by UlfAndersson to illustrate how to play against a chronic weakness. Andersson was one of the best players in the world in the seventies and eighties, even though he was not interested in competing in the Candidates Cycle. In 1 994 he started to play correspondence chess. Many of his opponents already used computers, but Ulf just sat in a cafe and analysed all day. And all night. For eight years. Listening to him explaining his games is the most valuable chess experience I have ever had. In one training session with Grandelius and me, Andersson showed his game against the highest-rated correspondence chess player, Gert Timmerman. After 20 moves, he had created a chronic weakness in his opponent's camp and could play without pawn levers. I know I can't live up to his comments, but here is the game:

0-1 Andersson: "This is one of the games I am most satisfied with." When I asked Andersson about the final standings in the tournament, he only knew that he had won. That's typical; Andersson played only to "analyse positions and send some moves". In another game, he had to decide whether to play ... V!Je7 or ... l�Hc8 first. He spent five hours a day for two weeks, while being on vacation on Majorca. It turned out that there was no difference between the moves; he played both. Andersson won the tournament with 1 1 Yz/ 14, one point in front of Timmerman, and became the new Number 1 on the ICCF (International Correspondence Chess Federation) rating list. However, he was happy when he stopped playing; it was too exhausting. There were many weaknesses to attack in the game above. If there is neither a weakness, nor an achievable pawn lever to play for, like in many of the games against Agrest, it's difficult to find a good plan. That's why pawn levers are the first thing to look for when creating a plan. Many of the positions against Agrest looked quite grim, but it can also happen that a position looks nice and yet no good plan is apparent. Here is an example that confused me for more than a year. Brede Kvisvik - Edwin David Kristiansund 1 7th September 20 1 1 I.e4 e6 2.d4 d5 3.tllc3 .Bb4 4.e5 b6 5.a3 .i£8 This is an unusual line. Black does not mind losing time with his bishop. Having provoked e4-e5, he can now prepare ...c5 without worrying about a weak d5-pawn. 6 • .Bb5t The idea is to prevent Black from exchanging the French bishop on a6. White answers 6 ... .Bd7 with 7 . .Bd3 and 6 ...c6 with 7 . .Ba4. 6 •• • .Bd7 7 • .Bd3 c5 8.c!tlf'3 lllc6 9.O-O .Be7 IOJ:tel c4 1 1• .ifl a6

[diagram]
White has space in the centre, but since Black plays the French, I guess he is happy with his lot. However, Black's pieces on the kingside are stepping on each other. Especially the knight on g8 seems difficult to develop. White also has a lead in development, so it's natural to look for a pawn lever. b2-b3 is well answered with ...b5, so f2- f4-f5 is the only possibility. Unfortunately all White's pieces are wrongly placed. The rook Chapter 1 - No Pawn Lever - No Plan 43 has moved from the f-file, the bishop stops it from going back, and the knight blocks the f-pawn. So even though White's position looks good, it's difficult for him to find a plan. I think White made an instructive mistake with 8.llJf3?!. If he had played the temporary pawn sacrifice 8.f4 instead, he would have had the possibility to play f4-f5 later. The next question is how to evaluate the diagram position. I thought it was pleasant for Black, since he had the possibility of advancing his pawns on the queenside. He can also try to control f5 by playing ...h5 and ... llJh6. I wasn't bothered that Houdini disagreed, giving an evaluation of +0.32. However, Hans Tikkanen argued for White's position. He noticed that White is able to close the queenside if he plays llJc3-e2. He can then answer ...b4 with a3-a4 and either ...b3 with c2-c3 or ...c3 with b2-b3. White's progress on the kingside is slow, but still exists. If he manages to play g2-g4 and llJg3, he might get time to go for f2-f4 later. White should also take care, though, since Black may castle long and attack the king if White opens up too much. It's interesting that it's difficult for both sides to find a good plan, since they both have problems achieving a pawn lever. The position is quite balanced. The game actually ended in a win for Black in 67 moves, but the moves are not relevant to our theme. Prophylaxis Prophylactic moves defend against your opponent's threats before they appear, and sometimes they may stop his entire plan. And since a plan is so strongly connected to a pawn lever, this is what you should look for, exactly as Evgenij Agrest does. I will show two games where one of the players finds a prophylactic move which stops the opponent's pawn levers. The first game below was played by Mr Prophylaxis himself, Tigran Petrosian. Tigran Petrosian - Samuel Schweber Stockholm Interzonal, 28th February 1 962 l.d4 ll)f6 2.c4 g6 3.c!Llc3 J.g7 4.e4 d6 5 . .te2 O-O 6.J.g5 h6 The Averbakh variation. One rule of thumb I have used in the King's Indian is to play ...c5 when White has played .Bg5. It makes sense, since the bishop is controlling neither b2 nor d4. However, I am sure there are many exceptions to that rule! 7 . .te3 e5 8.d5 c6 9.h4 cxd5 10.cxd5 c!Llbd7 In the King's Indian, Black normally plays for the pawn lever ... f5. When he played 6 ...h6 he left the pawn on f7 as the only defender of the g6-square. For that reason, it's less probable now that Black will manage to play ... f5. Petrosian continues to stop the pawn lever forever.

[diagram]
l l.h5! g5 12.0 a6 13.g4 The f4-square also looks weak, but with white pawns on d5 and h5, Black has no route for a knight to that square. Instead, Black's

only chance to create counterplay is to take space on the queenside. However, ...b5-b4 is not dangerous, since White has defended the e4-pawn with f2-f3.

13. ..b5 14.a4! b4 15.lLJbl a5

Neither player has any possible pawn levers, but it doesn't bother Petrosian since he has clear weaknesses to play against - the light squares on f5, b5, c4 and not least c6.

Black simplifies White's task of taking control of the light squares.

[diagram]
White has three minor pieces that can control the light squares and Black two - giving White a 3-2 advantage. For every exchange, White's advantage increases, since 2- 1 and 1-0 are proportionally greater differences than 3-2. In chess terms, the reason is that only one piece can occupy a square, but many can threaten it. White thus wants to exchange Black's minor pieces - except the ugly bishop on g7.

Black will probably have to play ... ibd6 sooner or later, after which White exchanges and plays the knight to c4 or d3, winning material. Looking at Black's position, I want to put the bishop on a6 to be able to play ... ibxc4. Unfortunately, I can't find a way to be in time to defend the pawn on a5 and stop d5-d6 at the same time. After the pawn sacrifice, the game is no longer interesting. The rest of the moves follow without annotations. Chapter 1 - No Pawn Lever - No Plan 45 29,qhe5 �k7 30.ttlc4 Ag7 31.�d3 <i!?gs

Kramnik exchanges on b8 and picks up the pawn on d5. 1-0 I used this example at a training camp in Kristiansund in March 20 1 2, but I thought that I needed one more example. Find Black's pawn lever in the following position and look for a way to carry it out.

[diagram]
Black's pawn lever is clearly ...c5. Black should postpone developing his kingside and try to carry it out as soon as possible. In McShane - Grandelius, Rilton Cup 2009/ 1 0, Black played 9 ...a6 and White tried to stop ...c5 with 1 0.a4 but after 10. ..c5! 1 1 .axb5 Bd5, Grandelius had a completely fine position. Most of the young players managed to get in ...c5 in an effective way. So far, so good. Chapter 1 - No Pawn Lever - No Plan 47 The next weekend it was time for the last rounds of the Swedish Team Championship. Who would accept Black against Evgenij Agrest? In 20 1 0 I had tried once again and managed to hold a draw, although I needed some luck. In 20 1 1 the match was important since we were playing for the gold medals; hence, neither Grandelius nor I was allowed to play Agrest. The match was more important than our hobby of losing against him. In 20 1 2 Grandelius thought he was ready. He said: "It doesn't matter that I have lost a few times against him when I was still a kid."

Grandelius played in the same way as against McShane, but was met with a stronger reply. IO.Eile5! The knight move opens the diagonal for the g2-bishop and so stops ...c5.

After IO ... lLlxe5, Grandelius will manage to carry out the pawn lever ...c5, but at the same time he moves the knight from f6 a second time before castling. l l .dxe5 also gives White control over the d6-square. l l.dxe5 tild7 l l ...lLldS is less natural since the knight would not control c5 or attack e5 and it also blocks the diagonal.

White's pawn formation with d4 and f4 makes his centre really solid, so he is strategically justified in attacking on the kingside with g2- g4-g5 . Before this advance is carried out, it makes a lot of sense to play two prophylactic moves against Black's counterplay.

12.c5! J.e7 13.a3!

Now ... a4 is met by b3-b4, or ... b4 with a3-a4. Black has no possibility whatsoever of starting an attack on White's king, so White can attack 'for free'. Strategically the position is already won, but Houdini's modest assessment of +0. 1 5 suggests that there might be some work left before White can collect the whole point. Mr Prophylaxis had an influence on the last position. In the 7th game of the 1 966 World Championship match, Tigran Petrosian had a similar position against Boris Spassky, but with reversed colours. Petrosian played ...c4 Chapter 1 - No Pawn Lever - No Plan 5 1 followed by ... a6, stopped all counterplay; he won convincingly. Every pawn move weakens at least one square This chapter has been about the advantages of pawn levers. However, it should not be forgotten that the pawns can't move backwards. Therefore, every pawn move also weakens at least one square. This is explained most easily by going back to one of my positions against Evgenij Agrest, shown in the beginning of the chapter. Evgenij Agrest -Axd Smith Sigeman & Co, Malmo 24th April 2008

[diagram]
I have already concluded that White is slightly better, since Black doesn't have any good pawn levers. It's time to think about the reason. When I played ...gxf6 earlier in the game, I thought that the slight weakness in my pawn structure wasn't problematic. The doubled pawns aren't weak, and I didn't worry too much about my king either. In my most optimistic thoughts, I even saw myself using the g-file for one of my rooks. The main disadvantage with doubled pawns is that they are static and have difficulties advancing, which is mostly a problem if they are part of a pawn majority. That's no big problem in the diagram position, since Black has no plans to advance the kingside pawns. What I didn't think of was what squares were weakened by ...gxf6. It permanently weakened all the squares on the h-file and slightly weakened the squares on the f-file. The squares on the h-file aren't that important, but the 'semi-weakened' squares on the f-file are actually what decide the fate of Black's bishop! With the fS-pawn still on g6, I would have been able to carry out the pawn lever ...e5 and get a nice position. But since the pawn is on the f-file, I need to keep the e-pawn on e6 to protect the fS-square. It took me months before I figured out that ...gxf6 prevented me from freeing my bishop with ... e5, but it felt like a real eye-opener when I understood it. Isn't it enlightening that the biggest disadvantage with a pawn move ( ... gxf6) is that another pawn can't move? It says something about the importance of pawn levers. It's actually possible to formulate a general principle: when you make a pawn capture to a file, you have to be cautious when moving the pawn on the adjoining file. In this case, Black captured something on the f-file with ... gxf6, and thus has to be careful when moving the e-pawn; the other neighbour to the f-file. It can also be formulated in another way: you have to be careful when moving pawns whose neighbour doesn't have a neighbour. It's the same if the neighbour exists, but has advanced. Hence, moving pawns that have one empty file in between them weakens the same squares. For example, d2-d4 and f2-f4 often don't look good together. This is why the opening from the previous example, the Stonewall, does not have a good reputation with some people.

Black has managed to execute his strategy. However, White is still okay, since he has good control over d4. The game ended in a draw in 58 moves. To sum up what has been learned: If the opponent has no chronic weaknesses and there are no achievable pawn levers, there is a risk that it may be impossible to find a good plan. For that reason, pawn levers are very important to consider. There are many reasons to play for pawn levers; to open up for the pieces, attack the opponent's king, take control over the centre or improve the pawn structure. However, every pawn move also weakens at least one square. One therefore has to be careful when moving a pawn if one of the pawns two files away has been exchanged or has advanced. I am sure I have many tough games against Evgenij Agrest in front of me, and I will surely find myself in positions where my pawn levers have been stopped. However, I will never forget that planning in chess often starts with finding out which pawn lever the position calls for. That's the take-home message of this chapter: always look for pawn levers, both your own and the ones of your opponent. It will make the rest much easier. Chapter 2 Club: Arboga SK Born: 1 95 1

About piece exchanges and material imbalances Ska vi byta? ("Wanna exchange stuff?") is a famous Swedish children's song by artist and chess enthusiast Hasse Alfredson. He exchanges a toy car for a rusty screw, then the screw for a yellow balloon, the balloon for an electric guitar, and so on. It doesn't concern anyone at all that the various items seem to have different values. Fair exchange is no robbery - they are both happy with the exchanges. It's the same in chess: sometimes you shouldn't mind exchanging a rook for a tricky knight. To be a bit more serious, piece exchanges are some of the most important strategical decisions and will be discussed in the first part of the chapter. The subject of the second part is something that's always difficult to evaluate: positions with material imbalances. The imbalances that are covered are bishop against knight, bishop or knight against rook, two minor pieces against rook, two rooks against queen, three minor pieces against queen, rook plus minor piece against queen, and minor piece against three pawns. Opposite-coloured bishops are also added to the list. UlfAndersson is the chapter's model player. He has already had one game in the book, against Timmerman. In that game, Andersson was a pawn down but had long-term compensation due to his safer king. I wrote that he often thinks in terms of outposts, but he also has a fantastic feeling for the pieces. He is never in a hurry, and methodically improves his pieces, step by step. It is like he always knows where they want to be. Piece exchanges There are many different reasons to exchange pieces. The three most common causes are that you have a material advantage, that the opponent has more space, or simply that the opponent's piece is better. An exchange can also be based on a transition to the endgame; with a better endgame or a worse middlegame, it's generally good to exchange pieces. The most obvious example is exchanging queens when you have an exposed king. The pawn structure can set the strategical reason for piece exchanges. With a better pawn majority far away from the king, it's often good to exchange heavy pieces, but when playing against an isolated pawn, it's instead good to exchange minor pieces. Actually, it's generally good to exchange pieces if you are conducting a strategically-justified attack against a weakness. The last case that will be mentioned in this part of the chapter is when you have two against-one of a particular piece. An exchange, for example of a bishop for a knight, can also be based on something other than the demands of the position. It is simply easier to outplay a weaker opponent when the material is imbalanced. However, such situations will not be covered here. The worst piece Sometimes the strategy of a whole game can rely only on a piece exchange, as in one of Ulf Andersson's correspondence games which we shall see below. I was very impressed by the apparent effortlessness of the game and was happy that I had recorded Ulf when he showed me the game. When Andersson demonstrates a game his gestures and mimicry are fascinating; it's possible to see in his face when he evaluates a move as bad. Those visual effects are lost when his comments are transcribed below, but nevertheless the words give a good picture of how he thinks. Enjoy!

Two things decided the game; the small weakness on the kingside after the exchange of dark-squared bishops and, later, the square on d5. Nothing else; it was enough. *** That is the end ofUlf Andersson's annotations. I really like White's simple plan of exchanging Black's fianchettoed bishop. That bishop was maybe not the strongest piece to use actively, but it was important for the black king's safety. It's also instructive to see Andersson's comments at move 32. It is generally good to exchange pieces when having a material advantage, but many players overdo it. In the game, Andersson even gave back a pawn to keep the bishops on the board. A bishop is usually defined as bad if it's blocked by its own pawns. For that reason, it's usually good to exchange such a bad bishop if we have one. However, it's not that simple. Grandelius pointed out that a bishop seldom is bad if a player has more space.
[diagram]

[diagram]

[diagram]
The position has three happy bishops, all fianchettoed. The fourth bishop has not yet found a good square! White's long-term plan is to carry out the pawn lever b4-b5, not only grabbing space on the queenside but also undermining the squares on the long diagonal. Since Black lacks good outposts on the queenside, it makes sense to force him to keep pieces that are placed there.

White follows up with a2-a3 and later b3- b4, with an advantage. Instead, 6lafsson played 1 3.a3?! tDxc2

moves. Technically, White doesn't have more space in the diagram position, but since it's easy for him to push a2-a3 and b3-b4, he should have kept as many pieces as possible on the board. The only pieces to exchange may be the dark squared bishops, trying to weaken Black's king in the same manner as in Andersson's game. So White should have kept the pieces on the board, since his plan was to grab more space. And with too many piece exchanges, it can even become a burden to have more space. Smith 2012

1-0 With a material imbalance, a rule of thumb is to exchange if you have two pieces of the same type. Often, the second piece doesn't work as well as the first. For this rule, remember that the light- and dark-squared bishops count as two different types of piece. Controlling squares Another situation when it's advantageous to exchange is when playing to control weak squares.

The same method can be used when attacking other weaknesses. A chronic weakness was in the previous chapter defined as something that doesn't disappear easily: a pawn, a square or the king. Hence, it's logical that a strategically-justified attack on the king can be enhanced by exchanging off defending pieces. This is exactly what Alexander Alekhine did, as Lars Bo Hansen pointed out in Foundations of Chess Strategy. While Mikhail Tal attacked in a normal manner by throwing all his pieces into the attack, Alekhine attacked by luring away or exchanging the opponent's defenders. Still, there must be more attacking than defending pieces for the exchanging method to work. Only then is the attack strategically justified. It doesn't even need to look like an attack on the king when the exchange takes place, as in the following example. Axel Smith - Tobias Restgaard H. C. Andersen Mindgames, Odense 1 9th May 20 1 2

when evaluating such positions is the other bishop - has it been exchanged or not? The bishops are much stronger when they are a pair. In 1 999, GM Larry Kaufman used several hundred thousand games to run statistical analyses, and later used his findings when he helped develop the piece algorithm for the chess engine Rybka. He argued that having the bishop pair would by itself give another Yz point (half a pawn), compared to the normal points system. That's interesting to know, but still not a strict rule. It often makes sense to retreat with the pair of bishops to avoid exchanging one of them. The bishops may be passive for some time, but will hit back in the endgame.

A typical position from the King's Indian Attack. White has the bishop pair, but for the moment the light-squared bishop is passive and the dark-squared bishop is threatened by an exchange. However, since the bishop pair is mainly an endgame advantage, White does best to retreat. l..icl This is better than l . .Bd2, since it leaves the square on d2 free for the knight. White's plan is to gain space on the queenside. It also makes sense to improve the position of the light squared bishop - maybe with the manoeuvre .Bg2-fl . White is slightly better. The bishop pair is mostly strong, but a single bishop risks becoming bad since it can only control half of the squares on the board.

From move five, when Black recaptured with the e-pawn on f6, White has played for the endgame. Black's doubled pawns are bad in different ways. The doubled pawns on the a-file are weak since it is difficult to defend the a7 -pawn if the queens come off. The doubled pawns on the f-file are not at risk of being lost, Chapter 2 - Fair Exchange is No Robbery 73 but they damage Black's pawn majority on the kingside; Black will not manage to create a passed pawn there.

A friend noted that the bishop on a8 looks like a soldier on top of a mountain, who is searching for his comrades with binoculars. The problem is that the comrades are far away, and he is looking straight into a tree. The bishop on a8 moves (well...) on the same colour as the pawn on c6. That's the definition of a bad bishop, especially when there are central pawns fixed on the same colour. However, often it's not so simple to define good and bad bishops - a "bad" bishop might, for example, be fulfilling a vital defensive task. It's easier to see if a knight is strong or not. They are normally best placed on an outpost in the centre or on a good blockading square. However, it happens less often that strong knights dominate a game. One reason is that the bishops have "the power of exchange" - it's Chapter 2 - Fair Exchange is No Robbery 75 easier to capture a strong knight with a bishop than vice versa. The player who exchanges the bishop for a knight often gets something other than a strong knight in return. It can be a pawn, extra space, time or some other advantage. He should then base his forthcoming play on this imbalance. The positions where the side with the knight has a development advantage are especially interesting. It's often in that player's interest to open up the position, even if it's said that the bishop is at its best in open positions. The idea is to try to decide the game or get another type of advantage before the endgame, when the bishop reaches its full strength. The following exchange might be a bit surprising.

Grandelius's game never reached the position where he could play l l ...ix:d4!?. As I see it, the move sacrifices some material but Black gets an initiative in return. In the variations we analysed, Black didn't try to get a strong knight but instead used his lead in development. Opposite-coloured bishops If there are heavy pieces on the board, opposite coloured bishops favour the side that is playing with an active plan. An attack is much easier to carry out with a clear dominance over either the light or dark squares. To stop such an attack, the defender can place his pawns on the opposite colour to his bishop. Then at least some squares are covered. Without heavy pieces, it's often possible to build a fortress with the pawns on the same colour as the bishop. This setup tends to be very static, but without heavy pieces to worry about, the king might be able to help the defence. The most interesting positions are the ones which are between those situations - with heavy pieces but no attack on the king. The defender can try to build a fortress, but it's not clear if he can cover all the weak squares. He can also try to set up an aggressive defence with the pawns on the opposite colour to the bishop, but that is risky since the pawns might become weak.

Chapter 2 - Fair Exchange is No Robbery 77 White is a pawn up, but with both pairs of rooks exchanged it would be an easy draw. White's main plan is to advance his pawn majority - the e- and f-pawns. To do this, he needs to support them with the king. For that reason Black should avoid exchanging on d l , since that would help the white king to cross the d-file. Black also wants to place his king in front of the pawn majority, but he cannot cross the d-file either. With opposite-coloured bishops, it's an interesting question how Black should arrange his pawns on the kingside. ...g5 followed by ...f6 gives safe pawns, but may allow White's king to penetrate to g6. The more active approach is to play ... f5, but it might just result in additional weaknesses. To be completely passive is a bad idea: 20 ...b6 2 1 .:gad2! :gxd2 22.:gxd2

Fair exchange is no robbery; both players were satisfied. When I played 1 6.ge l , I thought this position was slightly better for White. Black doesn't have anything special in compensation for the exchange - only a pawn and the opposite-coloured bishops. The problem is that White has a hard time finding a plan. It would be ideal to exchange rooks - since I have two - or to exchange off my light-squared bishop. However, those plans aren't achievable, because Black will not allow gd8 and there is nothing to exchange the bishop for! Instead, White has to open more files for the rooks. It is difficult to do anything on the queenside, since Black controls the dark squares. Instead, White's best plan is to push g2-g4-g5. It may Chapter 2 - Fair Exchange is No Robbery 83 not look so convincing, but there is nothing else.

18.Yfe3?!

Consequently, the best move was 1 8.g4. Sedlak evaluated the position as equal; I believe modestly in White. 18• • • Yfxe3 19.fxe3?

[diagram]
1 9.E:xe3 would be equal. Black's dark squared control on the queenside hinders White from opening files, and Black also controls the entry squares on the d-file. My last two moves have involved a queen exchange and a change in the pawn structure. Very critical moments, but I didn't ponder much. I was blinded by Black's possibility to play ...Bd4 followed by ...e5. If he is allowed to do this, the bishop will be at least as strong as one of my rooks and I would be happy if I could sacrifice back the exchange. The e5- square didn't worry me as much. In addition, I was happy that the queens came off, something that's usually good news when an exchange up. There are two reasons why my decision was terrible. The first is that it's actually wrong on principle to exchange the last piece that could defend the dark squares, such as e5 and g5. Black has strategically-justified play on the dark squares, which means that he increases his control with every exchange. It is good for White to reach the endgame, but the problem is that a rook exchange is just a fantasy. That takes us to the second reason why 1 9.fxe3 was bad. It makes White's only plan, to advance the kingside pawns, useless. Instead, White has an e-pawn that will never manage to exchange itsel£

A position with two minor pieces against a rook has arisen. The first thing to look for in such positions is whether the player with the two minor pieces has outposts. In this position, Black doesn't have any clear outposts and will not be able to coordinate his minor pieces against one target. The second thing to look for is whether the pawns can create dynamic play. They can - if White advances his queenside pawns, he will get two connected passed pawns. White is slightly better. His only risk is that he will weaken squares when he advances on the queenside, so he has to be careful. The game continuation keeps the material equal, but White gets a strong initiative.

Training position The exchanging operation seen in the previous moves can happen in various positions in the King's Indian. White gets two knights for a rook and two pawns. The position doesn't suit the rooks - there are no open files. At the same time, it doesn't suit the minor pieces either, since there are no outposts and no attack on the king. What Black needs to do is keep a dynamic pawn centre and advance with ...d5 and ...e5 without creating any weak squares. Ideally, he will manage to create passed pawns on both the c- and d-files. White, in contrast, wants to fix the centre by playing f2-f4 and e2-e4-e5. Ulf Andersson's intuition says that White is better, even though it might be difficult to play. However, when we analysed the position, we didn't reach a clear conclusion. I6.'1Wd4t?! The game move is very natural, centralizing the queen when Black can't answer with ...Rf6.

rook and pawn{s). The player with the minor pieces tries to create outposts, while the player with the rook tries to open files. He also wants to push his pawns, but has to be careful to avoid weakening squares. Queen against two rooks The queen's favourite activity is capturing undefended pawns. Due to its mobility, it creates double threats more easily than other pieces. The rooks are strong when attacking isolated pawns. For that reason, it's generally to the rooks' advantage if the minor pieces are exchanged. The minor pieces are otherwise natural defenders of the pawns. The pawn structure is an important issue: the player with the weakest pawns often has the worse position. Both the rooks and the queen have weak sides. The queen is the worst blockading piece and is therefore not good when fighting against a passed pawn. The rooks are, on the other hand, often quite helpless if they lack open files. That is why the combination of a queen and some pawns is a very strong attacking unit against a castled king - the rooks are not there to defend. The first example is illustrative since it shows both cases: a position which is superior for the rooks and a position where the queen has both a weak king and weak pawns to play against.

1-0 I think Black's ...g5 is a great example of how to handle a position where the opponent has a static advantage. It's necessary to do something before the opponent has got everything under control. Queen against three minor pieces I once listened to a seminar by Tiger Hillarp on the topic "Queen against two minor pieces". He enthusiastically showed positions where the pieces prevailed. With that in mind, a third minor piece seems to be a luxury! There is some truth behind that. Three minor pieces are usually better than the queen. One exception is when there are a lot of weak pawns that the queen can capture - that habit could be noticed already in the previous section. There are of course also other exceptions when there are enough dynamic resources to compensate, like an attack on the king, badly coordinated pieces or passed pawns. The general plan with the minor pieces is to attack weaknesses - their numerical advantage will make them impossible to defend. The king is the first weakness to consider, pawns the second. The following example seems very simple; something a Grandmaster can play in a blitz game or even when half-asleep. However, it's interesting since Houdini doesn't understand anything at all.

There are many reasons why this exchange sacrifice is good: 1) The rooks only have two semi-open files, both without prospects 2) It is not possible to exchange queens 3) There are opposite-coloured bishops Black doesn't have a single pawn for the exchange, yet I still have a slight preference for the black position. 22. ¥Nh5 a5 23.g4 .le4 24.f3 g5 The only move.

Thoughts about the training positions

1. Queen against two rooks

[diagram]
There are many reasons why the queen enjoys this position more than the rooks: 1) There are no open files 2) There are many undefended pawns 3) If Black castles, White might follow up with a pawn storm on that wing I think White is better, and I don't feel that any moves are needed to back up that claim.

3. Sebastian Nilsson 2010

[diagram]
This position appeared when my friend Sebastian Nilsson analysed one of his games in the 1 8th ICCF Olympiad. Black has two knights and four pawns for the queen. In addition, there are opposite coloured bishops on the board. The first time I saw this position, I thought Black was clearly better. He has no obvious weaknesses and White has no entry squares for the heavy pieces. Black's plan may be to start by putting minor pieces on e4 and d5 and then continue with the march of the queenside pawns. My reasoning was too static. It's difficult for Black to place his minor pieces on e4 and d5, and White has a lot of time to create dynamic play in the meantime. Hans Tikkanen noticed that Black even has a lot of problems developing the light-squared bishop at all. He evaluated the position as balanced. Today, I agree. White has some plans of his own. One is h3 and g4, to attack Black's king. Another is to move the queen and threaten i.xf6. If the knight jumps to e4, White can try the undermining g2-g4 with greater effect, or even l'!xe4 followed by l'!f7. Black has to watch out for all kinds of exchange sacrifices. A plausible continuation is:

1.Rg3 g£8!

Black is solid enough but still has problems improving his position. The a-pawn alone won't do the job. It's unclear. l ...lLl e4?! 2.Rc7 and White has some pressure against g7. l ...lLl d5?! 2.h4 is a bit annoying for Black. 1 00 Pump Up Your Rating

The situation didn't look good for my team, so I desperately needed to win. However, the best strategy in such situations is still to play the best moves! Of course, there is an exception if the best move leads to an immediate draw, but that is not the case here. I could have continued to play against the weak squares. A good start is 34.ttJh5! followed by ltlg3-f5. White can then open up with g4- g5 at a timely situation. It's unpleasant for Black.

lfz-lfz Epilogue This chapter has discussed piece exchanges and material imbalances. There are many possible reasons to exchange pieces, or to avoid doing so. Nine are mentioned in the summary of the first section. Sometimes pieces with unequal value are exchanged. In such positions, concrete factors will always play a big role, but the examples also outline several useful principles. However, don't forget about verbal overshadowing, the phenomenon that's mentioned in the introduction. Verbalizing too much is harmful for your understanding, and no proverb beats a good move. So get well acquainted with the principles outlined in this chapter - but use them with a grain of salt. Chapter 3 Auxiliary Questions The purpose ofthis chapter is to bind together the pawn levers and piece exchanges into a smooth list of auxiliary questions, which can be used in most middlegame positions. Well, that's far too simplified a way of playing chess, but I think it's a good idea to have the auxiliary questions in reserve, for when intuition doesn't define in which direction to steer your thoughts. I encountered the method of asking questions for the first time in a splendid book from 200 1 : Jesper Hall's Chess Trainingfor Budding Champions. The auxiliary questions I propose are simpler; rhere are only six of them. Chapter overview Why is it useful to have auxiliary questions? When you play, it's easy to miss the forest because of all the trees. There are so many threats to take care of and variations to calculate that there is no time left for the big strategical questions. Two of the heroes from the previous chapters, Nils Grandelius and Ulf Andersson, help each other in the chapter's first game to show why auxiliary questions are important. When should the questions be used? As "auxiliary" implies, they are used when your intuition isn't enough to find a satisfYing plan, and especially in critical positions. The second section will give some advice of how to identifY those positions during the game. It is recommended to use the questions during the opponent's thinking time, when there is less need to calculate variations. So what do they consist oft Mainly positional considerations. Some important positional themes have already been covered in the previous chapters: pawn levers, piece exchanges and material imbalances. This chapter adds other imbalances. How should the questions be used? They are presented in a list, but used only when encountering difficulties in grasping a position. Mterwards, it will hopefully be easier to find a good plan. 1 04 Pump Up Your Rating Is there something they should not be used for? Yes! The auxiliary questions are only there as an aid, and shouldn't compete with your intuition. The first thing to do is still simply look for good moves. But they are useful if you are encountering difficulties getting a handle on a position. Using Auxiliary Questions The first game illustrates why it's useful to use auxiliary questions. Nils Grandelius was Black and has annotated the game.

White should therefore take his time to search for a better move. 1 8.Be5! This fixes Black's kingside. Such moves along a diagonal are often difficult to find if it's also possible to exchange.

0-1 There were four clearly critical positions for each player: moves 1 8, 24, 32 and 34 for White and 1 2, 1 5, 28 and 3 1 for Black. It would have helped both sides to understand when they appeared. Imbalances In Reassess Your Chess, Jeremy Silman writes that it's useful to talk about imbalances instead of advantages. This is well shown in one of the examples from the previous chapter (page 61), where White's space would be advantageous with the minor pieces on the board, bur was disadvantageous without them. Taking that into account, it's better to talk about more space than a space advantage. There are nine possible imbalances in chess, all with self-explanatory labels: king safety, material, development, central control, initiative, space, piece placement, control over key squares and pawn structure. Chapter 3 - Auxiliary Questions 1 1 3 Most often both White and Black have an advantage in one or more of those nine categories. Both players want to make their advantageous imbalance the most important feature in the position. If the pawn structure is better, it's logical to strive for an endgame, but with central control, it's better to keep as many pieces as possible. The fight between different imbalances is well illustrated in the following game. The players are married, and since their children came to watch early on, I expected a quick draw. Instead, they created a very interesting game.

19.fi.xg7, winning the rook. Instead, I would

say that White has a small material advantage with the pair of bishops. White also has space, control over the centre and slightly better development. The pawn structure is unbalanced with many possible targets: h4, f7 and even c7. I prefer White's structure on principle, since there are two possible pawn levers: h4-h5 and d4-d5. It's difficult to say who has the better piece placement; neither side has control over important key squares. It sounds good for White so far, but there are still two imbalances left: king safety and the initiative. The position of both kings seems shaky. The player who gets the initiative will probably have the safer king, because the opponent will need to use his or her pieces for defensive purposes. Black needs to base his play on one or both of those imbalances: king safety or the initiative. He should avoid an endgame, where the bishop pair might be strong, and also avoid slow positions where the space matters. Therefore, he should act immediately, while White's rook still has to defend h4 and her king is on cl . With a pawn storm on the queenside, Black will get the most use out of his knights. In a messy position it's also pleasant to be able, at any move, to castle in either direction. If White uses all her forces to attack on the kingside, Black might simply escape by castling long, and vice versa.

53 . .Bxa4 g4 0-1 After 16 moves White had a lot of advantages, but that didn't help when Black managed to get his initiative going. Shortly thereafter, White's king became weak - the most important imbalance. Positional chess without creativity No one can play with just one grand gameplan, followed from the start until the end of the game. Rather, the plan may change from move to move depending on the opponent's reactions, and there may be several candidate plans to switch between. As I see it, positional factors in chess are things Chapter 3 - Auxiliary Questions 1 1 5 such as pawn structure, weak squares and good and bad pieces. All of them have a few basic principles that are easy to follow. Nils Grandelius has said that playing positionally means playing without creativity. He argues that positional decisions don't get difficult until the principles are questioned. Often they should be, but in simple positions there is less need for that; simple moves for simple positions. Sometimes there is actually nothing wrong with making a move without having any plan at all! Occasionally it's best to improve a piece without really knowing what to do on the next move. But only if it's a good positional move. One example is a move from the game against Stefan Christensen, earlier in this chapter, with Black to move.

[diagram]
I played 19 ... i.f5 to prevent White's f4- f5. I also saw that my knight looks nice after 20 . .ix£5 lilxf5, but I didn't calculate further. However, my thoughts were enough to play the move; there is no need for a deeper plan. This kind of chess without creativity is also in line with the conclusion from the previous section, to make natural moves in most positions and concentrate our efforts on the critical ones. I have noticed that many students I've had, including myself, have played in too complicated a style. While trying to take everything into account, we have forgotten that development and piece placement are often the most important things. The first plan is to complete development. The Swedish IM Emil Hermansson has half seriously added that it isn't completed until you have created luft for the king. I honestly believe that the advice of playing simply can be enough for many players to improve significantly. At least if it's connected to playing faster. While positional chess is every positional factor separated, I see strategic chess as all factors interwoven. The pawn structure needs to suit the pieces, and the piece placement should be adapted to the imbalances. When the players have castled on opposite wings, it's still positional to avoid getting a weak pawn, but it's probably not a good strategy to spend a tempo on such a thing. It's fully possible to have a positionally bad position and yet strategically a good one. Here is one example from the German league, where I play for Greifswalder SV: If I wanted to catch the train and reach the night-ferry to Sweden, the game could only take 2Y2 hours. I started by violating as many positional rules as possible. Axel Smith - Stephan Giemsa Oberliga Nord Ost, Berlin l Oth April 20 1 1 l.c4 ttlf6 2.lilc3 d5 3.cx:d5 ttlxd5 4.g3 g6

White's position looks like a beginner's. Two minor pieces sit on their initial squares while the queen has already moved; the king 1 1 6 Pump Up Your Rating can't castle on either wing and the g-pawn is backward. Black, on the other hand, has developed, castled and occupied the centre. Positionally, Black is much better.

[diagram]
However, the white pieces are cooperating with each other. The rook on b 1 stops the c8- bishop from developing. The bishop on g2 stops .. .l:!b8 due to Axc6, and .JiJe7 due to hb7. The queen stops ... a6 followed by ...b5 due to Eixb5. All those pieces work together towards the same goal. The white king can't be attacked behind the central pawns, at least not for the moment. White is much worse positionally and he isn't really threatening anything. Despite that, I think his position is better, but it's an extremely risky strategy. One slight mistake and it will backfire. That was what happened to Nils Grandelius when he lost a short game with White to Benjamin Bok in Corus 20 10. That game reached the position after 1 1 ...e5 and Bok won a brilliancy prize after checkmating in 21 moves. After the game, the computer quickly found the key moves for White on moves 12 and 13. The strategy is incredible - even Magnus Carlsen couldn't believe that it worked. However, it does! Grandelius showed the idea when he took revenge by beating an unsuspecting Eltaj Safarli in the Olympiad later the same year.

13.g4!!

Since the bishop on c8 has to stay put, the pawn is untouchable. White plans either lLlg1- h3-f2 or d2-d3 followed by Ae3, lLlf3 and g4- g5. I can say that it's quite calming to reach this position after having analysed it thoroughly.

1-0 Without any doubt, 1 3.g4 is my favourite move. White's g-pawn and king both look bad, but cannot be attacked in an effective way. It brings an old saying to mind: ''A weakness is only a weakness if it can be attacked." Chapter 3 - Auxiliary Questions 1 1 7 The central theme When evaluating a position with many imbalances, it's important to try to find out which of them is most important: the central theme(s). This is often where strong players prevail over weaker ones, since experience and intuition give an intuitive answer. And if the answer comes intuitively, there's no need to use the concept of the central theme at all. Nevertheless, it's also possible to try to figure it out. It is impossible, and too theoretical, to order the imbalances from one to nine. Here is a rougher list: 1) King safety 2) Material 3) Development, initiative 4) Central control, space, piece placement, control over key squares and pawn structure However, even though king safety is the most important imbalance, a slightly safer king doesn't have any impact at all if the opponent has a huge lead in material. What you have to do is check the different imbalances, in order of importance, and ask yourself if it can be enough to win the game. If the answer is yes, there is a great chance that you have found the central theme. I will again illustrate with a position from the game against Stefan Christensen, with Black to move. White is trying to attack Black's king, and that attack is clearly a central theme. On the other hand, White's heavy pieces on the kingside will be clumsy if the attack stagnates. It may be enough to win; hence piece placement is another central theme. In the game (page 1 09), Black managed to neutralize White's attack.

[diagram]
Mter the tournament in Vladimir, appreciated the concept of critical positions. However, I have also heard that the secret of the Soviet Chess School can be captured by the phrase: "Ifyou need to do something, do it!' It is a truism, but useful if it's interpreted like this: look for the central theme and try to do whatever you can to make the impact of that imbalance as big as possible. If the opponent's pawn structure is clearly better, but you have some possibilities to create an attack on the king, you should not care much about the pawns but make all possible efforts to attack the king. Playing according to the central theme sometimes requires immediate, dynamic play, and other times slow, static play. Some of the imbalances are possible to categorize as either dynamic or static, like development, initiative and material, but most are not. To have a better king is usually a temporary advantage, but it was a permanent (static) advantage in the game Timmerman - Andersson from the first chapter. You have to use your reasoning ability when you decide which tempo to strive for. The take-home message is to lean back and ask what's most important. Many players play in too complicated a fashion and forget about simple things such as development and piece placement. 1 1 8 Pump Up Your Rating The Auxlliary Questions The list of six auxiliary questions below covers the topics of the first three chapters: pawn levers, piece exchanges and critical positions. It's especially useful to ask the questions when it's the opponent's move; with less need for concrete calculations, there is time to make the positional considerations. I know I am repeating myself, but once again: If a strong move appears intuitively, there is nothing wrong with playing it. To force you to use the auxiliary questions would be too time consuming and would also be mean to a good old friend: your intuition. But the questions are useful if you can't find a plan, or if you can't choose between several different moves. AB you will quickly find out, some questions suit certain kinds of position. 1) Is this a critical position? The position is critical when you have to take a decision that is difficult and can't be taken back, such as in the case of pawn levers, piece exchanges and tactics. 2) Are there any pawn levers? Pawn levers are often the foundation of a plan and decide on which squares to place the pieces. The question should be asked both for yourself and your opponent. 3) Which imbalances are there? Possible imbalances: king safety, material, development, initiative, central control, space, piece placement, control over key squares and pawn structure. Are there any clear weaknesses to attack, a weak pawn, a weak square or a weak king? 4) Which pieces do you want to exchange? Take both your own and your opponent's pieces into account. Which is the worst-placed piece? 5) What is most important? Which tempo should you strive for? Compare and evaluate the findings from Questions 1 to 3. What seems to be the central theme of the position? Is your plan to consolidate, take prophylactic measures against the opponent's plan, or should you play actively before the opponent has achieved coordination? The last strategy should be used if the imbalance(s) in your favour are of a temporary nature. 6) Which candidate moves should be considered? Which move feels intuitively positionally correct? Look for candidate moves and make a short blunder check in the end. In the List of Auxiliary Questions, the positional factors (Questions 2-4) form the strategy (Question 5), which is implemented with the help of universal game theory (Questions 1 and 6). Candidate moves will be thoroughly examined in the next chapter. However, there is some specific advice I can offer about positional candidate moves. It's not possible to prove it, but I think that the inner logic of chess makes positionally-intuitive moves work tactically more often than it looks at first sight. Hence, it's worth spending some extra time looking for supporting tactics. It's also a good idea to start by calculating this move, since it has the highest aims. If it works, there is no need to examine other moves carefully, which would save time. When you play a move, it's not important to know the evaluation of the upcoming position. You only need to know if it's better than the other candidate moves. The evaluations you make when you choose between plans and Chapter 3 - Auxiliary Questions 1 1 9 moves are therefore not absolute but only compared against each other. If a move is clearly best, you should play it no matter if it's winning or drawing. I think that if you have such an attitude, you will after some time get used to taking decisions when comparing moves. It will less and less often happen that you think that two different moves or plans are of equal value, but instead consider the continuation you choose to be the best. 3) s

Using the auxiliary questions: 1) White may try b4-b5 to create a passed pawn, or f4-f5 to attack Black's king. Black can try ...g5 to undermine White's pawn on e5. 2) The position is very unbalanced. In the short term, White's king seems safer, but Black's king might be able to hide on g7 later. White has a development advantage and more space, while Black has a small material advantage with the bishop pair. The general target seems to be Black's king. 3) White doesn't want to exchange pieces, since his extra space may become a disadvantage, but it would be great to get rid of the strong rook on c4. The rook on dl is the worst-placed piece in White's position. Black's wishes are, of course, the opposite. 4) White's advantageous imbalances are mainly of a temporary nature, so he should act immediately. 5) IfWhite decides to go for a pawn lever, the position is critical. 6) White has to do something with the rook on h3. 26J!xh4, 26J!dhl and 26J!b3 are candidate moves.

White enjoys a clear plus due to the horrible light-squared bishop on c8. The plan is to gain more space on the queenside and open up the position at a suitable moment.

controlling e5, Black must prepare with ...f6. How to take prophylactic measures against this? & noted, every pawn move weakens at least one square. . .. f6 will weaken g6, but a bishop sacrifice doesn't seem likely to work. It's therefore logical that White must attack g6 with a pawn.

The point is that 1 5 . . .f6 16.h5 is a disaster for Black. 1 5.l:!e3 is also designed to stop ... e5, but my intuition is against breaking the connection between the rooks, and I also want to use them when pushing the pawns on the queenside or defending against Black's possible ...a5 and/ or ... b6.

17.lLlxd7 hd7 and White has several reasons

to be dissatisfied. With less space, Black is generally happy to exchange pieces, but especially the knights since White's knight had more tasks. Both knights fought for the vital e5-square, but White's knight did in addition defend d4. Even worse for White is the loss of a tempo, since Black is ready for ...e5 while White has to defend the pawn on f4. 1 8.g3 e5 is a strategical failure, so White has to try 1 8.h5 Wfxf4 19.hxg6 f5 but with d4 hanging and ...e5 coming, Black is on top. When I saw this position I was halfway through writing this book and felt that I could just skip all the other examples. This one alone is a highway into the book's essence: thinking about pawn levers, weak squares and prophylactic measures. I showed the position at a seminar, and one of the listeners managed to play a similar h4-h5 lever only a few weeks later! The only problem with the example is that many of my students played 1 5.h4 to attack the king, which is not really the idea behind the move. So I had better include the rest of the material in this book anyway. Chapter 4 Calculation I remember once when I was very satisfied with a variation I calculated during a game. It was long and had a beautiful point at the end. The game went differently, but I showed the variation to my opponent in the post-mortem. He couldn't understand why I had spent so much time on it; after only three moves it was clear that something had gone wrong for him. He was absolutely right. Calculating well is not the same as calculating far. A player who chooses reasonable candidate moves, calculates them in a reasonable order and knows when to stop, will often find better moves even though he calculates much shorter lines. That is the subject in this chapter - the theoretical side of calculation. Chapter overview The chapter is divided into three sections. It starts with a tough introductory example - a very tactical position from a game of mine, where I spent a lot of time calculating. Later, I gave the same position to Hans Tikkanen as an exercise, to compare how we thought. It turned out that he was much more structured. The position will be used as an example when discussing various topics later in the chapter. For that reason, I suggest that you spend some time on it. The second section discusses structured calculation, with the following parts: 1 ) Just looking 2) Calculating the most forcing moves 3) Setting a goal 4) Candidate moves 5) Sorting the candidate moves 6) Calculating and visualizing 7) Comparing 8) Falsifying 9) Blunder checking Ideally, those tools only need to be carefully studied once. Even though it will always be possible to improve your skill in calculation, at least you will have a foundation.

At the same time, I am conscious that although this is a way that has worked well for me, it may not suit others. You should therefore feel free to pick what you like, and dismiss the rest. The normal reaction when seeing a list like the one above is: "That is not the way I calculate!" That's true, and you should not. This is a theoretical chapter, but the idea is that you study the tools, practise them thoroughly, incorporate them into your subconscious, and finally let intuition guide your calculations. If your calculations are running smoothly, it would just be stupid to disturb them. However, when intuition doesn't flow, it is useful to deliberately use some of the tools. The third and final section discusses visualization and the ability to calculate, again with a few sub-topics: 1) Visualizing 2) Working memory 3) The opponent's moves 4) Going forward in the variation 5) Focusing on a position 6) Ending the variation The second section can be seen as the railway track and the third section as the locomotive; both are needed to take the passenger to her destination. In this chapter there are also several concrete training tips, which may help to add more fuel to the engine. One exercise In the diagram position, it's White to play. Use up to 25 minutes to decide which move to play, trying to calculate as well as possible. Endnotes1 are on page 1 56.

It was time to calculate! I will reproduce the thought processes I had when encountering the position, and later the thought processes of GM Hans Tikkanen, when he was given it as a training position. I wrote down my thoughts after the game, while in the case ofTikkanen, I recorded him while he thought and spoke at the same time. Our calculations should definitely not be mistaken for a solution! When calculating, the moves are thought of in many different ways, but for simplicity, I have given them with standard annotation. Since the thoughts jump back and forth, it may be a good idea to use a board and pieces.

Chapter 4 - Calculation 1 39 Structured calculation There is no universal calculation model to follow through thick and thin. However, there are some tools that are useful to learn. As I wrote in the introduction, I believe that many thinking techniques can be internalized if you use them extensively for a period of time. That is the idea behind this chapter. It makes sense to make this presentation in some sort of chronological order, but it is not a strict one. Using everything would be cumbersome, so I think it's best to focus on one part at a time. With those many warnings issued, it's time to start sketching the process of calculation. !) Just looking You are probably already looking for interesting moves and ideas before it's your turn. When the opponent has moved, the first question is: Why did he play this move? If he threatens something, you normally have to defend, even though creating a counter-threat is a nice way of doing so. But if he doesn't threaten anything, you can continue to just look for a short time. Many years ago I had a friend who enthusiastically said that he had discovered the secret to playing well. He said that moves simply came to him when he looked at the board. I didn't give much for his insight, and rather saw it as a sign of his usual laziness, chatting as much as thinking. Many years later I appreciate what he said. Moves are automatically popping up when looking at the position. I have not yet met a chess player who has managed to stop moves popping into his head, and it only would be harmful if we did stop them. The importance of the initial thoughts should not be underestimated. In some way the moves that just 'pop up' are random, but at the same time they are probably some of the most forcing moves. They give a feeling for the position, what you should strive for, and probably hints about how much time needs to be spent. Only then is it time to start being a bit more structured. 2) Calculating the most forcing moves If you have a clearly forcing move, it's a good idea to simply start by calculating it. The move is usually the one that aims highest, and if it works, you don't need to calculate other moves as carefully. If it doesn't work, you've got less to keep in mind. Also, the most forcing move seldom takes much time to calculate. And while doing this, you might discover tactical possibilities that are useful to be aware of when you list the candidate moves. In the initial example, I started by calculating the discovered check 20.hb5t. That was good, but when I noticed that it took some time to finish the calculations, I should have paused to look for other candidate moves. 3) Setti ng a goal Before asking "how?" you must have the answer to "what?" - it's difficult to search without knowing what to look for. After having taken a quick look at the position, you often have a feeling of the approximate evaluation. Your intuitive goal is to get a position which is at least as good as that. However, sometimes it's necessary to actively set a goal. There are three different types of goals. a) The goal is based on an absolute evaluation When I encountered the position in the introductory example, I knew that my opening analysis ended in a slight advantage and that I had made two good moves since then.

140 Pump Up Your Rating

Hence my goal was to find an advantageous position. For me, this kind of reasoning is very common. By analysing the opening at home, I get a feeling for the evaluation, which becomes my goal during the game. However, the goal can also include practical factors, like getting a good position without risk. A computer or a perfectionist would not approve, but, as Vassilios Kotronias mentioned in Grandmaster Battle Manual perfectionism is something that only fits in an ideal world, a utopia. With the clock constantly ticking, the chess board is definitely not utopia. Occasionally, the position seems to be screaming for a tactical win, which sets the goal to "win". Other times, the goal has to be restricted to "survive", for example when the opponent has a tremendous attack. b) The goal is based on something to achieve Three examples are: taking control of an open file, castling before the opponent gives a check, or carrying out a pawn lever. c) The goal is based on a particular position Most often, the goal is only to reach a position that is better than another particular position. The following position is one example.

However, it was also possible to play 2 I ..!e6t El2f7 23.'Rc2! and Black collapses. After calculating 1 9. .!h3, there is no need to examine the other moves. In the introductory example, Tikkanen started to look for candidate moves. The first move he calculated was 20.hb5t, the most forcing move and the only one that may win on the spot. Clearly, it is a good principle to start with the move that has the highest aims. b) In a calm position, start with the most logical move On the American TV show 60 Minutes, Magnus Carlsen said that he almost always knows which move he will play after less than 10 seconds. Such intuition is not for mere mortals, but even we have quite a good feeling for which move is positionally correct. Actually, the most logical move works tactically surprisingly often, even when it doesn't look like it, as I suggested earlier. Our intuition, practised in every single game, has created a decent feeling for seeing the move the position calls for. Therefore, it's worth spending some extra effort on that move to look for supporting tactics. There is another reason for starting by calculating the positionally correct move. Psychological science has found that there is a human bias to choose the option examined first, even if the conclusion doesn't say that it is best! In theory, it should be possible to avoid such a bias, but I am not sure how it is in practice. 6) Calculating and visualizing After having sorted the candidate moves, it's time to calculate. The subject is covered in the next section. In every line you calculate, you reach a point when it's time to evaluate the position. As established above, you mainly need to check if the position fulfils the goal you have set. To do this, you probably have to compare it with another position. 7) Comparing Humans don't evaluate positions with decimal numbers, as engines do. We make verbal or even unspoken evaluations. However, during a game, you don't even need to do that! You only need to decide whether the position is good enough to comply with your goal. When I calculated 20Jhe5 in the introductory example, it didn't matter if I thought that I was slightly or clearly better. The only thing I needed to know was if I liked the resulting position better than the position that I concluded with after 20.i.xb5t. If the resulting position complies with the goal, you can either be satisfied and make the move, or raise the goal and continue to calculate. Intuition will probably hint if there is something better or not. In the following example, Black starts with some strong moves but has a difficult choice a few moves later. The two possible continuations are both good and difficult to choose between. Chapter 4 - Calculation 1 45 Jens Ove Fries Nielsen - Daan Brandenburg Schackstudion GM, Lund 1 5th April 20 1 1

An extra pawn in a rook ending is no guarantee of a win, but in this position Black has four against two on the kingside. White can't defend if Black simply advances the pawns. I would guess that both 23 ... 'Rc5 and 23 ... l:l:xd5 are objectively winning. What you have to do is not evaluate both positions objectively, but instead compare the positions with each other. When you make such a comparison, you also take into account practical considerations. There is much less risk of a blunder in the rook endgame, so I would no doubt choose 23 ... l:l:xd5. A feeling for the final verdict often appears during the calculations. Sometimes, it's quite

clear that it won't fulfil the goal. Then it's better to leave the move for the moment, and continue with another. The ability to calculate far is very important, but so is the ability to avoid calculating far when it isn't required. 8) Falsifying After some time, you have a feeling for which move is best. Of course, this is not enough to play it, since it's nothing more than a hypothesis. Actually, you have not reached much further than Carlsen would after 1 0 seconds! It is time to try "proving" that the hypothesis is correct. This is done by falsifying other reasonable hypotheses. "Isn't that move better?" "Is the chosen move really working?" The calculations become a bit deeper, by continuing where they stopped earlier and trying unlikely possibilities. Between 1 938 and 1 946, Adriaan de Groot made experimental studies of chess players' thought processes. In Thought and choice in chess (1 948), he stated that the main difference between weak and strong players was that the latter used a lot of the time, on average 50%, trying to prove that their chosen move was best. As you could see in the transcription of Hans Tikkanen's thoughts from the beginning of the chapter, he went backwards in his lines and asked: "Does Black have other moves?" That is a way of trying to falsify his conclusion. To falsify is not the same thing as using the Process of Elimination. That method works extremely well when solving exercises, since there is always a solution. In a game, it's different. If the goal is "to find a winning move" and all but one move has been excluded, it's very foolhardy to play the remaining move. The move might win, but the chance that the goal was too ambitious is not negligible either! The move might actually lose, while other moves draw. It's better to set a less ambitious goal and continue calculating. Thus, solving too many exercises can actually have a bad impact on your game. The solution is, of course, to shut your eyes to the hint that there is a solution to the exercise. Try to think of the position as if it is from a game. During games, the Process of Elimination is mainly used when defending. However, it can't be used alone. Moves that don't fulfil the goal are eliminated, but the last move standing must also be checked. The following game exemplifies the process of falsifying, and is also a good illustration of how to set a goal.

I'll go for 28 ... .L:g3." And this is what Black played in the game - he should have drawn, but a later slip cost him. Black started by quickly calculating one line. Mter that, he set a reasonable goal to get a position with an extra pawn, and a hypothesis that 28 ...Rxd4t was the move to play. He started to falsifY the hypothesis and realized that it didn't work. He eliminated 28 ...Rxd4t but didn't find any other lines that gave an extra pawn. After that he had to set a new goal - to reach an equal position. He also needed to check the variations again, since he had not looked for equality in the lines he had calculated. The subconscious intuition easily excludes positions without really asking our conscious mind! A position with a doubled pawn may be rejected, but without considering whether the doubled pawn really is a weakness. In such situations, the intuition much be questioned by asking: Should I really avoid this move due to the doubled pawn? Intuition is a strong ally, but at times you have to confer with it! 9) Blunder checking In the introductory example, Tikkanen finished with a blunder check. There are few greater feelings of relief than when the blunder check discovers a huge blunder, and you get a chance to choose another move. A blunder check consists of the simple questions: a) What did my opponent threaten with his last move? b) What function does my piece have now, and consequently will give up when it moves? c) Does my opponent have any simple tactics? The first question is usually answered immediately when the opponent makes his move, but sometimes deep calculation may blind us to simple things. Generally, it's too time consuming to calculate variations twice. Blunder checks do that, in some sense. Hence it's better to make small blunder checks in the beginning of every tactical variation. It saves time by eliminating blunders before the whole line is calculated. Training tips: For a limited period, be very careful by doing a blunder check before you execute a move. In this way, you obtain a good habit that can be used later. You also get a better feeling for in which kinds of position you need to do a blunder check.

YNc8! Simensen found a double threat, winning a pawn. At the start, 1 3.Be3 was better. Summary The theoretical way to calculate is as follows: After having looked for interesting moves and ideas, you quickly calculate the most forcing moves. In that way, you get acquainted with the position and sees if there is an immediate win. However, before you start calculating seriously, you need a goal. What are you searching for? The goal is often based on a comparison with a particular position - you want to find a move that leads to a better position. After having set the goal, you look for candidate moves and sort them. The move that aims highest should be listed first - it's the move to start calculating. From each line, you get a position and check if it fulfils your goal. The evaluation of the position doesn't have to be absolute, you only have to compare it with the other positions you can reach. When you have made a preliminary decision in favour of a move, it's time to falsify it. Isn't there really anything that can be better? Lastly, it's time to make a blunder check before you execute the move. As mentioned above, you will not always use this method in practice, but it's useful to work with all of these parts, to use them subconsciously and take them out when you need. VISualization 1) Visualizing The most difficult part of calculation is to visualize the position, especially many moves ahead. To be able to do this, the position must be kept in your head. However, many players complain that they can't see the complete board in their head. I would say that it would be remarkable if they could! I can't even manage to focus on all the squares at the same time when I look at a real board. So why should it be possible without the board? The size of the part that can be seen in your head can't be measured in centimetres or squares. It's not only a geometrical figure that is visualized, but also a concept, whose size is 1 50 Pump Up Your Rating better measured in units. The pawn structure around the king may be one unit, for example. The pieces that aren't actually seen in your head are stored in your memory. For the same reason, it's very difficult to play Fischer Random blindfold. In such games, the pieces are arranged in a way you don't recognize, and thus you have problems merging them into larger units. Since the board in your head isn't graphical, different players see it in different ways. For some, it's vague, for some two dimensional and for others three dimensional. I do not doubt that some creative players even have a four dimensional board in their heads! We humans are able to visualize a mental map in our head, which we can use to recreate where we have walked. Nils Grandelius has jokingly said that he replaced his map with a mental chessboard. He lost his sense of direction, but became able to calculate far ahead! Well, even if the substitution never happened, the point is that strong players have developed a complete mental overview of an empty board. They know every square's colour and coordinates, and thus find it easier to see the range of the pieces, such as bishop's diagonals. This clearly facilitates calculation. Many strong players think "Knight c5" and suddenly see the knight on c5. Thus, the piece doesn't move, but just appears on the new square. Even strong players can, on the other hand, mix up the coordinates by involuntarily turning the board upside down. The h3-square is replaced with the a6-square, and so on. This actually doesn't harm calculation, since the squares keep the same colours and relative position. The analogy of the coordinates system as a foreign language is also quite good. Without being able to speak the language, all arguments must be translated before they can be presented. The coordinates system gives chess players a common language needed both to visualize and to discuss with other players. Training tips: There are a lot of exercises that can improve your mental board and help with learning the coordinates system by heart. a) Play on a board without coordinates and analyse by saying the squares instead of pointing at the board. b) Read from a list of random squares and say the colour of the square. c) The previous exercise reversed: point at a square and say the coordinates. 2) Working memory Working memory is an important part of visualization - memorizing the placement of the pieces. Psychological experiments have shown that it's only possible to keep about seven things there, with an individual difference of plus or minus two. But the chessboard consists of 32 pieces and 64 squares. Fortunately, the pieces are not stored one by one, but in larger units or chunks. The more experience a player has, the larger units he builds. Pawns on h7, g6, f7, a king on g7 and a rook on f8 is a well-known structure, which is stored as a single unit. An enemy bishop on b2 might also be included, if it checks the king. Other parts of the memory When calculating, much of the capacity is busy with thinking and making abstract assessments. If the working memory can't handle all the pieces that move in the calculated variation, they have to be transferred to other parts of the memory. That happens automatically, which explains why many players in the post- Chapter 4 - Calculation 1 5 1 mortem can repeat most of the variations they calculated during the game. But the working memory works more quickly and smoothly. When I played a 1 5-board blindfold simul, it consequently took some time to retrieve the position every time I switched between the games. I am not sure if the correct terminology is the intermediate-term memory (ITM) or the episodic part of long-term memory (LTM), but that's not important. To remember where the pieces are placed is, on the other hand, important. You don't need to actively memorize their squares, only be able to look for them when they are needed. For example, if you want to play ... i>h7, but are afraid of a check on the b1 -h7 diagonal, you look for White's light-squared bishop and queen, to see whether they can give such a check. Another example is when Tikkanen calculated in the introductory example. He asked himself: "Is the knight caught?" Then he looked around and answered: "No, the rook is still there and stops 26 . .. i>d7." Emotions facilitate the storing of memories. For me, chess games are very personal and filled with emotions, which may be why I remembered almost all the lines I calculated in the introductory example when I saw the position again, two years later. It's also about experience. Other parts of my memory are less practised. I am writing this in Hamar in southern Norway, and I can't for the moment recall the colours of the walls in the apartment where I have lived for the last year. When I came home from an apartment we considered buying, I was asked if there was a window in the kitchen and if there was a dishwasher. I couldn't answer either question! What I should have done was not to remember the dishwasher as an object but, of course, to remember its function - to replace me in doing the dishes. Focus The working memory's most important component is The Central Executive (Baddley & Hitch, 1 974). It focuses the attention on the task that should be performed, and nothing else. Psychological experiments have shown that the ability to block other visual and auditory information correlates very strongly with the results at many cognitive tasks. This does, of course, include chess. Focus is thus a key to being able to calculate well. The working memory is not only used to memorize the position of the pieces while calculating, but also when you compare positions, or when you reuse tactical motifs you have seen. To train the working memory is thus really helpful for your skill in calculation. Many people complain about their memory and blame increasing age. No doubt, this is part of the explanation but I think that attitude and training are even more important. Everyone can practise their memory! Training tips: Memorize the positions when solving exercises. Look at the diagram, try to remember, put it away and set up the position on the board. Doing this also helps the ability to group the pieces into units, which is important for visualization. There are also many other ways to practise your memory. For example, going to the supermarket without a shopping list, or refraining from writing down reference numbers and phone numbers. 3) The opponent's moves If the opponent has several moves, which is the best one to start calculating? Use the same principle as for your own candidate moves! Start with the most forcing or most ambitious 1 52 Pump Up Your Rating move. If it works, it can refute the whole idea, making it meaningless to calculate the opponent's other moves. However, if you are quite sure that none of his moves will fully satisfy him, you can start with the weakest moves. They can quickly be refuted and put aside, improving the order in your head. In the introductory example, after 20J:!:xe5 .le6 21.tLld4, Tikkanen started by calculating 21. •• .Be6, since his intuition suggested that move was best. He calculated Black's other moves only at the end. 4) Going forward in the variation When you make a move in your calculated variation, I think it makes a lot of sense to think of it verbally: "Bishop e6", "Knight d4". Since only a part of the board is seen in your head at a time, the rest of the pieces are kept in working memory. That doesn't only consist of The Central Executive, but also The Visuospatial Sketchpad and The Phonological Loop (Baddley & Hitch). The capacity of each of them is limited, so it's easier to remember if both are used - so you 'see' the move and hear it in your head. Personally, the second time I make the same move, I often replace the coordinates by thinking "take" or "check" or "there", depending on which type of move it is. Sometimes, when a move isn't working, you need to go backwards in the variation. If it's only one move, it's possible to do it in your head. Otherwise, my experience is that it's best to start from the beginning. To take back several moves risks messing things up, while it doesn't take many extra seconds to plough through the whole variation. In the introductory example, Tikkanen also started from the beginning when he needed to go back some moves. There are also a few other habits that make it easier to calculate. As mentioned in the paragraph about visualizing, the position isn't stored in working memory as a meaningless piece of information, but from the function of the pieces. After each move, it's therefore important to look for the new function of the piece: which squares does it control? This is especially important to do with forced moves. For voluntary moves, the function is seen more or less automatically - if there is a reason behind the move! One common mistake is to 'move' pieces which have previously been captured. In some way it's possible to say that they have moved involuntarily - off the board! Again, the same trick can be used, to think about which squares they don't control anymore. So, constantly updating the pieces' function is the key. It makes it much easier to keep the correct position in your head, when looking at another part of the board for a moment. I also think that it's good to update the material balance after each move. Often, chess is no harder than taking more pieces than your opponent! Young players learn to count the pieces on the board, not the ones off the board, since some of them may be in the opponent's hands. When calculating, it's on the other hand much easier to count the pieces that are captured. A possible line of thought from one of the lines in the introductory example is "pawn down, equal material, piece up, exchange down, piece up". In pawn endings, some books recommend counting the tempos. My experience is that much can be overlooked along the way with such a method. It's much safer to execute every move in the variation in your head. The most common question asked of chess players is: "How many moves ahead can you Chapter 4 - Calculation 1 53 calculate?" No question is more irrelevant - it does not get more difficult with the number of moves, but with the number of moved pieces. Besides, it's seldom necessary to calculate more than a few moves ahead. The introductory example is one of the positions I have spent most time calculating during a game. Even there, the main point (23 . .!f5) is no more than seven half moves ahead. 5) Focusing on a position In Improve Your Chess Now, Jonathan Tisdall recommends a method called the Stepping Stone Method. The method is to pause at a critical position in a calculated line. During the pause, you look at piece after piece to get a clear view of the position. However, most often only a few pieces move in a calculated variation, which makes it easier to look at the board. Most pieces stay on their initial squares! Only a few players, such as Alexei Shirov and Vassily Ivanchuk, have the amazing habit of looking out of the window or up at the ceiling, but not even they do it regularly. In long and complicated variations, I also find it too time consuming to use the Stepping Stone Method. It may be a matter of taste, but for me it's better to be careful every time a piece moves. Nevertheless, even if it was possible to calculate the variation, it may be difficult to assess the resulting position. A weak square is much easier to see on a real board than on a mental board. That is because the position doesn't automatically show up; you need to 'ask for' the pieces and squares to see them. If you know what to look for, like a weak square, it's no longer difficult to see if there are any. Often, the preceding moves point out the important positional factors. In the following exercise, it's necessary to calculate many moves ahead. Bo Lindberg 2006

PART II

A TRAINING PROGRAM

1 58 Pump Up Your Rating The first part of this book was about 'thinking chess' and examined methods that only have to be studied once. Well, only once at least in theory. In practice, you will notice that even if you look carefully for candidate moves in one tournament, it's possible to forget about them in the next. The focus of the second part of this book is on everyday training; what you need to do continuously to improve. First things first - you have to enjoy your chess training. I have always enjoyed every part of chess, and thus have never needed to worry about my motivation. However, the Swedish chess instructor Robert Danielsson has formulated four golden principles for all chess training, based on the acronym MONA: Motivation, Variation, Level Adaptation and Active Learning. (Yes, I know that doesn't spell MONA - the acronym comes from the Swedish language). A varied and level-adapted program motivates, since the training becomes more enjoyable. We are all different, and it's impossible that the same methods will suit everyone. Hence, I encourage you to pick what you enjoy from the following four chapters. The first step is to look for a training partner. It is not only necessary when analysing games you have played and important when analysing openings, but it also broadens the way you think. Furthermore, two players tend to inspire and push each other in the right direction. Your ambitions and opportunities to spend time on chess will vary over time. The following chapters are written for everyone, from the player who "only" wants to pump up his rating a little bit, to the player who will do everything she can to become as strong as possible. In some ways, both players can do the same things, only with different intensity. While the first player solves tactical exercises for fifteen minutes, four days a week, the second may do so for two hours a day. Nevertheless, there are some training methods that should be given priority. Mummies In Lund we have an expression for a player who never improves: a mummy. It is not said in a negative sense; the mummy enjoys chess. The romanticizing of the expression has even gone so far that The Mummy (SK Mumien) is the name of a chess club! Many mummies actually see themselves as quite ambitious players. This could be a typical chess diary of a mummy: Monday: Playing blitz for two hours on the internet. Tuesday: Watching live games from a super-tournament for the whole evening, while checking the games with an engine. Wednesday: Warming up with some blitz games, before watching a DVD. Thursday: Planning to prepare for the weekend's game by reading a chess book, but running out of time after reading chess news on the internet. Friday: Reading a book about great players from the past. Looking at the diagrams, but concentrating mostly on the great stories in the text. The book is read in bed, thirty minutes before falling asleep. Saturday: Losing a tight game in the league, and afterwards claiming that a single mistake decided the game. Checking the game quickly with an engine. Sunday: No chess; impossible to be motivated after such an unfair loss! A Training Program 1 59 Our mummy spends a lot of time on chess, but he won't improve much. Many of his training methods do not follow the fourth capital from MONA: Active Learning. The key to learning a foreign language is to try to speak it. Without any doubt, it's also good to listen, but it's when sentences are first formulated that improvement really starts. It is the same in chess, and active learning is my hobbyhorse as a coach. This means questioning statements in books (maybe I should have mentioned that earlier!), forming your own opinions, and using training methods that activate your brain. With only some small changes, our mummy can come alive! Limit the number of blitz games to a maximum of five per day Blitz can be a good form of training if you are fully concentrated, but it is often played just as a routine. In addition, in internet blitz a lot of time is wasted, not only waiting to start games, but also playing uninteresting positions, for example when it's high time for one of the players to resign. I also recommend using some minutes after each blitz game to check the openings and think if there is something that you don't understand. Watching live games without an analysis engine An engine often has the effect of putting your brain into hibernation. It's better to predict the players' next moves on your own. (By the way, I have never understood why it's so interesting to follow things live, often just waiting for the outcome, but then I have never owned a Tv.) Watching DVDs with exercises Sadly, my brain can't reach the same level of effort when I passively take in information, as when I have a task to solve or a question to answer. That's why this book contains exercises in every chapter. In addition, the speed in DVDs are for the average viewer, and that can't be effective for everyone. Accepting mistakes Our mummy player doesn't seem to have good self-knowledge, since he persuades himself that he lost the game only due to one mistake. To be open and accept all our mistakes is a very important characteristic for an ambitious chess player! Focusing on the chess I don't consider historic knowledge to be important. However, I know there are other schools of thought, and I have even heard one of the most acknowledged FIDE trainers say that it's impossible to become strong in chess without knowing the World Champions in chronological order!

When I played against Lajos Portisch in Sigeman & Co in 2008, I knew only a few of his games - the games from the first rounds of the tournament. Furthermore, I don't think I have ever seen a complete game by Bobby Fischer. Of course, I would be happy to know more, but my point should be clear enough: the moves are important, not the names. My advice to our mummy player would therefore be to read everything in the chess books and magazines, not only the gossip. Of course, I don't argue against reading chess news, but I see it more as entertainment and inspiration rather than serious training. Being fresh when practising chess You should strive for quality in your chess training. If you happen to be tired when it's time to study chess, or dead as in the case of the mummy, I think it's better to postpone the session. That was a lot of advice, but none of it should be that hard to follow. I also think it's a good idea to structure the time you spend on chess, at least a little bit. If a few hours are set aside for chess, wirh your mobile phone off and the internet unplugged, it's much easier to stay focused. Not only because the surroundings are less distracting, but also because you have a clear purpose. The same advice can be used for other areas. When I became disappointed with my focus while writing this book, I threw away my mobile phone, and forbade myself to check news on the internet. Almost a year later, it's still impossible to call me, but the book is finished. Club: K.ristiansund SK Born: 1 999

Black's queen is best placed on c7, but first she chases White's knight away from its central position. 7.tLlb3 and 7 . .Be3 are interesting options, but I expected the game move, since Socko had played it before.

Chapter 5 - The List of Mistakes 1 69 9 ....le7 This is well-known theory. When analysing the game, I wondered why no one plays the natural 9 ... tl:\f6. I did not manage to find an amwer before I checked the games in the database and compared with similar lines. It's important to check the opening phase carefully, since future opponents will use the game in their preparations. After 9 ... tl:lf6 White plays 1 0.e5 tl:ld5 1 1 .tl:lxd5 .Bxd5. Black doesn't want to allow White to exchange two minor pieces, which happens after .Be4. To avoid tl:lxd5, Black can start with 9 ...b4, but it seems like an unnecessary provocation to make another pawn move. lO.eS f5 l l.a4 b4 12.tLla2 A new move, leaving my preparations. The advantage with 12.tl:la2 is that White can develop with 'Rd2 and E:ad1 without moving the knight again. The disadvantage is that the knight is passive. 12.tl:lb1 was played in a game by one of my students. With the knight on b 1 , it's possible to manoeuvre i t via d2 to c4.

12. .. tLlc6 13. .Bf4 tLlh6

This is a standard move in the line, so I didn't have to consider it for long. IfWhite captures, Black gets play against g2 with a rook on g8 and bishop on b 7.

The most natural move is 14. .. tLl f7, preparing to open the g-file with the pawn sacrifice ...g5. However, I thought 1 5. .Bxf5 exf5 16.e6 tl:ld6

17.E:ad1 was very good for White. Grandelius

and I found no reason to question that. When I checked the analysis with Houdini, I wanted to know if 1 5 ...g5 was a threat. There is a better way to find that out than making a waiting move like E:ab 1 : Ctrl+Alt+O enters a "null-move': The answer: it was a threat. If my coach would have analysed the game with an engine, he would have noticed that it prefers 14 ... tl:\f7, but such a conclusion makes little seme on its own. People usually have reasom to play as they do. As I had. And since I am my own coach, I can check the calculatiom with Houdini. Houdini proposed a tactical solution that saves Black: 14. .. tl:\f7 1 5. .Bxf5 g5! The idea shows itself after: 1 6. .Bg3 exf5 17. e6

My idea behind this move was to be prepared to get counterplay on the g-file if White captures on h6, but Grandelius immediately questioned it.

The engine indicates that White is clearly better. However, you should not accept the engznes evaluation without understanding it. During the game, I actually thought that I could activate my pieces and have good drawing chances. However, when I tried to find concrete lines, everything seemed bad for Black. One reason is my king in the corner, a real shame! So then I agreed with the engine's evaluation and attached a "?!" to 26.'8xb8.

We have an ending where White has the possibility to get an outside passed pawn, while Black will try to make his central control felt. Hence, it's an easy positional decision to keep as many pieces as possible.

28 ...g5! looks better. I played quite quickly, to avoid time trouble, and ...g5 didn't even enter my mind as an option! Actually, I think it's an excusable mistake to play too fast, since time trouble usually leads to more serious mistakes. This mistake would not be noticed if the game was only analysed with Houdini, since the engine doesn't assess it as a better move. I am not sure.

[diagram]
It seems passive with the bishop on b7 and rook on a8, but White can't improve his position. The knight is standing in the way Chapter 5 - The List of Mistakes 173 of the b-pawn and the rook doesn't have any open files. Black may manoeuvre his knight to c5, thus overprotecting a6 and freeing all his pieces.

It is a questionable decision to open the g-file when my rook is tied to the a-pawn, but I couldn't see how White could make use of the file. However, the most important reason for 33 ...g4 is that the h-file is much more interest ing for Black than the g-file, since White's rook can't use the entry square h l . Then ... ltJd6- e4-c5 combined with ...h5-h4 gives Black a pleasant position. Having heard Grandelius explain all this, I didn't have any objections.

37 . .i6t g4 38. .Bg2 1-0 I was 14 years old when the game was played and didn't understand why I had lost. A local trainer, Hans Frisk, taught me that you should have not just one, but even two pawns to enter that material constellation. I was stunned and even though I accepted what he said, I couldn't really understand it. To get that understanding represented good chess to me. Five years later, my eagerness to play good chess had made me believe that two pieces were always better than one. It was many years later that I actually learned Hans Frisk's motto was: "Quality over quantity". The solution to avoiding future mistakes is not going back to the Bc4, lt'lg5 and lt'lxf7- strategy. It's much easier than that. The initial evaluation is often good, but at the same time routine. I made the instructive mistake of not questioning it. What I needed was to carefully consider whether the pieces were able to cooperate against a target or not, and whether the side with the single piece had some dynamic (pawn) play. My thesis with the List of Mistakes is that gaining such knowledge about one's weak sides is a huge step towards avoiding them. If I am conscious about the fact that I overvalue two pieces against a rook, or two rooks against a queen, I should be able to adjust for that. Overestimating the ideal pawn centre For the moment, I find about five mistakes per game, and probably I made even more earlier. With 1750 games, I have thus made over 10,000 mistakes. To my students I often say that the player with the greatest number of mistakes wins! However, that's not enough - they also have to be recorded and analysed. Below are two similar positional mistakes, both from Cappelle la Grande 2008. Josef Gheng - Axel Smith Cappelle Ia Grande 1 8th February 2008 l.e4 e5 2.tlJ6 tlJc6 3 . .Bb5 tlJf6 4.d3 .Bc5

Compared to the position in the previous game, there is an extra pair of knights, which favours White. The knight on c6 is easily tamed by the pawn on c3, and stops Black from defending the centre with ... c7 -c6. White's setup is similar to the King's Indian Attack, but her bishop on b3 is much more active. Hence, it seems to be a good idea to exchange bishops. However, 9 ...dxe4 10.dxe4 Be6 1 UWe2 Bxb3 12.axb3 improves White's structure and in an endgame with dark-squared bishops, White may profit from the fact that the pawn on eS is blocked on a dark square. In the previous game I was too ambitious, trying to enhance my centre by playing ... f5. In this game, I cleared a path for my c-pawn with 9 ... llJa5, which was, not so surprisingly, again too ambitious. I think that optimal play from Black's side requires a lot of patience, just waiting with a move like 9 ...h6. My ultimate conclusion is, however, that the problems started already when I played 6 ...d5. Lallemand simply defended the centre with 7.llJbd2! and with knights on f6 and c6, I have no natural pawn levers to strive for, as ... dxe4 still leaves the knight on c6 misplaced.

The bishop would have been out of play on h7. After the game move, White should probably go for getting the bishop pair with Wfe2 and tLlc4. The question is whether this is enough for an advantage. If Black manages to exchange the dark-squared bishop, he should be completely okay, but White will prevent this. I think Black wants to keep the queens on because Black's is a natural defender of the e5-pawn. On the queenside I think White should answer ...a7 -a5 with a2-a4. In such positions White has normally played c2-c3 to cover the d4- square, but there is no need for this move in the game since Black's knights are a long way from d4. This makes a huge difference - the b3-pawn isn't weak after a2-a4 and the bishop on b2 is active, while at the same time hiding from exchanges. All in all, I think White holds a small advantage. Even so, 9 ...dxe4 is clearly the best move. l l.ttlh4 j,c5 12.tLl5 O-O 13.Wff3 l:!fe8

I need all available time to prepare. I showed this game to make the picture realistic; the List of Mistakes is useful but not a panacea. But it would have helped if I had reviewed the old lists, not for the sake of the memories (they are all sad!) but to remind myself of my weaknesses. Exchanging heavy pieces I include about 30 games - three tournaments and some league games - in each List of Mistakes. For people who don't play so often, it makes sense to have fewer games in each list. The following three games were played with just one month in between them.

The knight is better than the bishop in this position, since Black has many pawns fixed on white squares. The pressure along the e-file won't win the e3-pawn, but at the moment it ties White to the defence of it. If White had his hands free, he would use one of the two semi-open files. Either he would double on the c-file followed by b4-b5, or he might penetrate on f6. Another plan for White is to carry out the pawn lever e3-e4, which takes space and creates tension in the centre. However, with the queens on the board, this will hardly be possible. Hence, Black should keep the queens. 31 ... '?Nd6??

With 33.g3 White would have a safe advantage. Later on, Black will probably have to play ... f5 to stop e3-e4, which shuts in the bishop. Then, White can slowly prepare for a break on the queenside with b4-b5. Instead White played 33.ttJc3 and the game was drawn in 54 moves. Never make a positionally dubious move only because it's the simplest solution against the opponent's threats! In the next example, the question is again which heavy pieces to exchange, if any.

White has the better pawn structure and Black lacks play for his bishop, since the pawn structure on the kingside is symmetrical. If Black is kind enough to exchange a pawn on b3 and thus allow White to recapture with the c-pawn, White can use the rooks on the c-file to attack the weak pawn. Otherwise, it's difficult to use the rooks on that file. To exchange both rooks would be in White's favour since it's a much greater risk that the bishop ends up alone, controlling only half of the squares on the board. However, Black wants to exchange one pair of rooks to reduce White's influence on the d-file. Having said all this, it's not difficult to find the best move:

0-1 In all of these examples, I only saw a part of the picture; a dangerous knight sacrifice, an open file or an attack against a pawn. All of my moves would have been good if they had been working, or necessary if there was nothing else. However, since they were all anti-positional, I really had to know what I was doing before I decided to play such moves. I did not. What I didn't keep in mind was: Think about the positional considerations before deciding upon the candidate moves. In the next List of Mistakes there was nothing in the column for piece exchanges. That was satisfying! In the following game, I had to make another critical decision regarding the exchange of heavy pieces.

At first glance it looks like White has some compensation with two open files. Houdini also only gives a moderate advantage for Black with -0.35, but after having analysed it, I concluded that White's activity is temporary.

The position looks messy, but it's clear that White's pieces are better placed. The battery on the bl-h7 diagonal has forced Black to create the weakness ...h6 and the queen is now ready to increase the pressure on the al-h8 diagonal. Black's queen, on the other hand, is on the

same line as White's rook. The general feeling is that White should be able to get an advantage.

This is a type of move that is really forbidden to play. White just exchanges his good pieces and leaves Black with a small initiative. The big problem is that I knew it was wrong, but played it anyway!

react. a) 17. .. lt::l 5f6 18.lt::l fe5 This is better than on the last move, since Black doesn't have ...

In a Sicilian Kan, I have just launched my h-pawn towards my opponent's king. Even though it seems strange, I think h2-h4 is White's best reply.

1 5.h4! is still best, but after 1 5. .. ttlg4 Black has a slight advantage anyway. It's interesting to note that h2-h4 creates a strong outpost for Black's knight, but only because White's d-pawn has been exchanged! The reason is that White's f-pawn has to cover the squares on the g-file, since the h-pawn has advanced, and also cover on the e-file, since the d-pawn is exchanged. It can't cover both g4 and e5, and Black can thus have his knight on one of those squares.

Getting cautious in winning positions The problem of not trying to play the best move is even more apparent in winning positions, where it's easy to become nonchalant. Nothing is more irritating than unnecessarily giving away a half-point. The remedy is to try to play the best moves all the way till the end in every game - even when you have a lot of extra material. There is nothing wrong with being rational and choosing a safe option, but in many cases the reason is really nothing but pure laziness. In most winning positions a final calculation has to be made anyway. The earlier, the easier. Here is one tragic example.

The most straightforward move is 3 1 .lLlb5. I saw that the pawn promoted straightaway and that I could defend easily on the second rank. But somehow I managed to convince myself that the game move was also winning easily, while being much safer. This is forbidden thinking!

I overestimate the passed d-pawn. Also in this case, the knowledge should be enough to avoid doing so again. In winning positions, I am often too cautious, not going for the most direct win. In the critical moments, I become lazy and often choose a quite passive move. I must give my full effort and try to get the most logical move to work! If I avoid a variation, I must have a reason. I have some problems with time trouble, but not much. As usual, I should continue trying to play even faster. The positional mistakes are easy to categorize. A few times, I have also tried splitting the tactical mistakes into details, such as backward moves, presuming that a threatened piece has to move, not considering pawn moves in front of the king, missing unusual moves, missing sacrifices, etc. However, I have seldom managed to get any useful information by doing so. Personally, I think the psychological mistakes are the most interesting. One time I found that I assessed my position too pessimistically after I realized that I had made a mistake. Another time I found that I became slightly desperate in bad positions. These kinds of mistake are the easiest to correct. That can't be said about the last two conclusions in my summary above. They are even a contradiction. If I try to calculate every critical variation, I will not play faster than before. It's important to find a balance, and to feel when there is a critical position where thorough calculation is required. By gaining more experience, and pointing out where I have problems, I will hopefully improve even with that. When I make a new List of Mistakes, I copy the old conclusions and check whether the same mistakes are made or not. Hopefully, most of them have disappeared. Club: Lunds ASK Born: 1 986 Frisk has been a member of Lunds ASK since 1994, and was the club's president from 2008-10. She has represented Sweden in the European Team Championship and in the Olympiad. Frisk made two WIM norms in 2012. Chapter 5 - The List of Mistakes 213 Helping others The first thing I do when I am coaching a student is to create a List of Mistakes. Some typical mistakes are usually highlighted already after a few games, but the main point is to help the student to get started. Later on, the student can analyse the games with a friend, annotate them and add them to their List of Mistakes. The games and the list are sent by mail to the coach. His task is to comment on the positional thoughts in the annotations and making some conclusions from the mistakes - of course without using an analysis engine. One advantage with such an approach is that the coach's time is spent effectively. When I got together with Ellinor, my future wife, in 2008, we didn't do any chess together at all. I thought our relationship was more important than a nerdy hobby. She got her motivation back two years later, when she was selected for the Swedish women's team in the Olympiad. At the same time, I had grown up and no longer had any need to appear normal. We both enjoyed chess, so why not? The first step was creating a List of Mistakes for her. We found a lot of things: she was too cautious with advancing the flank pawns, a bit reckless with her king's safety, automatically thought that a bishop was stronger than a knight, underestimated the importance of development and never saw the possibility to fianchetto the bishops. After every tournament, she checked if she had managed to avoid those mistakes. During the next 1 6 months, she made steady progress and increased her Elo from 2 1 1 3 to 221 8; another example that you don't have to be a junior to improve. In 20 12, she became employed, had to decline a spot for the next Olympiad and lost her motivation. The lesson is clear: never get a job. Below are four positions from her games and the moves she played. All of them are the same kind of mistake. Your task is to find out what she needed to learn for future games.

I will make a few comments about this game a few moves earlier than the position I showed a few pages ago. In a French Steinitz, Black has pushed the pawns on the queenside. White's plan is to create a kingside attack after the pawn lever f4- f5, but this is difficult to achieve. Most times, Black can just capture the pawn. For Black, ...b4 and ... .ta6 are the positional moves, but since the rook on aS is hanging, she should not play 1 3. ..b4 at once. 13• • . .Ba6?! The right plan, but it would have been better to be careful and start with ... .tb7 and ... b4 before playing ... .ta6. In the game, Luther manages to stop ...b4.

'1'xe3t?! This helps White to develop the knight, connect the rooks and play E!:fb 1 next. Instead, an exchange on b6 would have helped Black improve the knight.

Chapter 5 - The List of Mistakes 217 This was played without much reflection - the intuition to avoid doubled pawns was never questioned by Frisk. Actually hd5 just helps Black to develop, while ...hc4 isn't a threat at all since it weakens the d4-pawn. In addition, the new pawn on c4 would be easily defended. 1 1 .ttJxd4? hg2 1 2.E!:g1 .Bb7 is anti-positional for White, because she can't castle short anymore. 1 1 .O-O! is better. a) Black can't just develop since 1 1 . .. ttJf6 1 2.ttJxd4! .Bxg2 1 3.ttJxe6 loses a pawn. b) 1 l .. . .Bxc4 1 2.dxc4

Now there are two options to consider: b1) 12 ... .Bc5 White has ideas with .Bf4-e5, simply doubling on the d-file, opening up with c2-c3 or kicking the bishop with b2-b4. Most exact is 13.a5!, which creates a square on a4 for the knight after c2-c3 next. b2) 1 2. ..e5?! looks dangerous, as Black is several tempos behind in development. 1 3.c3 d3 ( 1 3. .. dxc3 14.lDxc3 gives White an initiative.) 14.lDg3

In this position, White has two main plans. The first is to exchange the e-pawn for Black's d-pawn with e2-e4, then exchange all the pieces to get a winning pawn endgame. This is the same strategy as in the Exchange Ruy Lopez, except with the healthy majority on the queenside. However, a lot can happen before all the pieces are exchanged. Most often White instead plays for a strategy based on the pawn lever c2-c4. After ... dxc4, White has two pawns in the centre, while Black has none. The pawn duo secures some space, which makes it easy to play with the knights. Quite often it's possible to exchange one of the knights for one of Black's bishops. Going back to the game, after 4 . .Bxf6 exf6, White doesn't have the possibility to push c2- c4, since the knight is already on c3. Hence, Black only needs to stop e2-e4, or secure adequate counterplay ifWhite manages to play it. I think this is possible, so I do not approve ofWhite's position after 4 . .Bxf6 exf6. Instead, Frisk played:

Chess is 99% tactics - Richard Teichmann Like so many maxims, there is some truth in Teichmann's quote. Despite this, pracnsmg calculation is quite a small part of most players' chess training. The reason, I believe, is that it's difficult to define exactly what you have learned. That desire for tangible results is very human ("Today I memorized 30 moves of Griinfeld theory'') but even so there is nothing more valuable at the board than being able to calculate well. Chapter overview This chapter begins with a discussion about tactical training, with Hans Tikkanen as the model player. Tikkanen improved a lot when he started to work systematically and he also inspired a Danish friend to even greater improvements. The general advice is to make the training similar to a game situation. One way of achieving that is using a chess clock. The second section deals with tactical motifs. It facilitates calculation to know their features by heart. One of the motifs has not been named before: the lifeline. The chapter contains 5 1 exercises of varying degrees of difficulty. Most of them (1 2+6+ 1 2+6) are presented before each tactical motif, but the last section also holds 1 5 challenging exercises. Tactical training Hans Tikkanen is interested in studying the human brain, its structure and function. His training program was designed to fit the way that humans learn to intuitively recognize patterns. Tikkanen started by solving quite simple tactical exercises. When he finished, after about 1 000 exercises, he took a short break, and then started all over again on the same exercises. And when he finished for a second time, he started a third time, and so on. Tikkanen's results were convincing - his three GM norms the following summer gained him more than 1 00 Elo points. I have therefore named the training program after him: The Woodpecker Method. This comes from the meaning of 'Tikkanen' in its original language, Finnish. However, as Tikkanen is a somewhat mysterious and modest person, he doesn't want to explain the underlying theories or exactly how he did it. What I have written in this chapter is therefore my interpretation, but as I have followed him closely, it's hopefully close enough! There is another sunny story about this method's effectiveness - the Danish player Andreas Skytte Hagen, who also plays for Lunds ASK. Since 2006 he has been a serious chess player: playing, analysing openings, reading books and solving exercises. However, his progress was modest until he met Tikkanen at a tournament. Suddenly, Hagen increased from 2290, in March 20 1 1 , to 2454, four months later. It turned out that both Tikkanen and Hagen had read the same book: Geoff Colvin's Talent is overrated (20 10). Colvin proposes a tough training program with repeated exercises. Feedback should be given after each training session, which means using a timekeeping and points system. In that way, progress can be seen from day to day. Chapter 6 - The Woodpecker Method 223 The difference between Tikkanen and Hagen was how they interpreted the word repeated. Tikkanen understood it correctly - exactly the same exercises should be solved several times. When Hagen started doing so, he was hugely successful! Tikkanen worked for six to ten hours a day. For people with normal non-chess jobs, it would take many months to work through 1000 exercises. Therefore, I recommend that amateurs cut it down to "only" a few hundred. However, I think it's important to have at least a few long sessions for the brain to get really into it. When you see the exercises for the second time, you will remember some of the moves. That is both because your repertoire of standard moves has increased and because you remember the last time you tried to solve the exercise. A typical line of thought: "I spent twenty minutes on the train with this one. When I found the solution, the train had passed my destination. I should have seen the move earlier!" But remembering the first move is not the same as the solution! You should calculate the variations until the end as if you haven't seen the position before. That is important - the brain must understand the underlying tactics and be trained to calculate the variations to the end. Being able to quickly screen the position for possible defences is important to improve speed of calculation. The tactics books Tikkanen and Hagen used were not the secret. Hagen says he uses any random book, and Tikkanen has even used quite bad ones. I repeated his training program, not with the same diligence, but still with clear results. The solutions at the end of the book I used are completely scribbled over with my corrections - many of the exercises were wrong and even unsolvable. For that reason, I will not recommend a specific book - any will work! But, you may ask, isn't it better with instructive and carefully chosen exercises? I don't think it makes much difference. It's a bit like running intervals. If there is something wrong with your running style, you need instructions, but after that you simply need to do a lot of hard work. However, I do prefer books where the solutions are given with extensive annotations. It's disturbing if various logical defences are not covered or if there is no mention of promising tries that don't quite work. One chapter in Move First, 1hink Later is named "Trust your chess module". Willy Hendriks argues that you subconsciously arrange the ideas you learn when you solve tactical exercises; you improve your pattern recognition ability without noticing it. This is in line with the discussion about verbal overshadowing from the introduction. Hendriks quotes GM Leonid Gofshtein from Amatzia Avni's 1he Grandmaster's Mind: "I used to play with my head, now I play more with my hand." This captures the point quite well: Don't try verbalizing what you have learned, let your automatic chess module take care of it. You have to trust that mechanism; it's the teacher of your intuition. A lot of calculation is about two things: speed and pattern recognition. But I hope I made it clear in Chapter 4 that some structure doesn't hurt as well.

Tactical motifs Tikkanen started by carefully examining the tactical motifs - the subject of the next section. The exercises were sorted by motif in the first books he used. Much is gained if you automatically know the possible defences against a pin, to take one example. However, during a game there are no hints that tell if there is a special motif available. So the next natural step is to mix the motifs. How much time should you spend practising the motifs? The best and only answer I can give is - until you feel that you know them well enough. Tactical exercises When it comes to solving tactical exercises, you should remember that you are not only practising your tactical ability, but also concentration, time management and decision making. After having set up the pieces and looked at the position for some minutes, it's possible to take a coffee break and continue much later on. During a game, it's not. And since the training situation should be made similar to a game, l think there are a few useful principles: Always choose a move You don't have to solve every exercise, but if you don't find the solution, you still have to choose a move to play; just as in a game. Furthermore, the exercises must be solved in order, without moving back and forth between them. Take responsibility for the move Often, the tactical motif is spotted quickly, especially if you have seen the position before. But as written above, that is not the same thing as the solution. You should check the variations like in a game. And try to avoid the Process of Elimination, which unfortunately works quite well when you know there is a solution. You have no reason to blame yourself if you don't find the correct move, but you are to blame if you found it but didn't bother to check the variations. Use a chess dock Give yourself a limited amount of time. This is important; it prevents you just enjoying yourself instead of focusing! The normal way is to solve as many exercises as you can manage in a fixed time. Another way, which has additional educational gains, is to decide upon a fixed time for a number of exercises. If you solve the first exercise quite fast, you get more time for the next, and vice versa. Thus, you have to take responsibility for how much time to spend on each exercise. If you don't find the solution in one of them, at some point you have to choose a reasonable move to save time for the following exercises. When the time runs out, you must have chosen a move in all of the exercises. Otherwise, you lose on time and should give yourself zero points in all of them! Award yourself points Points, ratings and records are rewarding, and motivate you to push yourself to the maximum. Tikkanen and Hagen tried solving the exercises faster every time they repeated them. Hagen had Chapter 6 - The Woodpecker Method 225 a daily one-hour session and gave himself one point for each exercise he solved, and deducted five points when he failed. And he didn't allow himself to move on to a new section of exercises until he had scored highly enough! In fact I like a modified points system better: - The first mistake is not having any points deductions - you have to avoid any tendency to become a perfectionist. - If you don't find the solution, you should only get two points deducted. - However, if you fail because of carelessness, missing a possible defence or not calculating the variations to the end, you should get a five points deduction. However, I think it makes even more sense to avoid spending too much energy calculating the points! When I used the Woodpecker Method for the second time, I had four daily one-hour sessions with a short break in-between, and simply tried to solve as many exercises as possible in each session. In a way, the points system was a bluff, since the main component to success was to be "lucky" and get simple exercises. However, the points system was enough to trick my brain into believing it had to use every second wisely during the session. The conclusion is that you should make up your own points system. Anything that can make you work harder has value. Exercises, not studies The calculations you have to make during a game are often quite simple and seldom study like. It should not be harder when practising. In addition, it's tempting to start thinking about something else if the exercise is too difficult. No chatting It's very nice to solve exercises with friends, but there is a risk that focus will be lost. When one exercise is finished, I want to start on the next one, without listening to an explanation of why one of us didn't find the solution. By now, it's time to make a summary of The Woodpecker Method. 1) Study all the tactical motifs, and solve thematic exercises, until you feel that you know them well enough. 2) Choose a number of tactical exercises, from 1 00-200 for the normal amateur, to 1 000 for the serious professional. Solve them intensively and compete with yourself, by recording the time and awarding points. 3) Take a break for at least a day but not more than a couple of weeks. 4) Use the same set of tactical exercises and try to solve them faster. Tikkanen used fifty percent less time for the second round.

226 Pump Up Your Rating

5) Continue until you think you are fast enough. Tikkanen stopped when he managed to solve all the exercises in less than a day, but that meant a whole day! 6) If the program has whetted your appetite, choose a new set of exercises. Humans are creatures of habit, and need to enjoy what they are doing. Hence it's important to create good habits. The brain usually puts up some resistance against solving exercises, as it would against any demanding activity, but after a few days of persistence, it may already become an addiction! Other forms of tactical training Working with the Woodpecker method is like running in a hamster wheel, so other forms of tactical training are not really necessary. But for some, varying is an end in itself. Playing blindfold is good practice for visualization. On the other hand, I believe less in going through games blindfold. When you play, you make half of the moves yourself and thus give both your own and your opponent's moves meaning. It makes it easier to visualize and remember. When playing through games, the same meaning becomes a bit artificial; you only need to remember vaguely where the pieces are placed. If blindfold sounds difficult, it is possible to start with a more moderate goal. Jesper Hall recommends not moving the pieces when analysing games with friends. For many months, I started every day with 45 minutes on chess.com, one of the Tactical Trainers that's available on the net. These programs comply with most of the requirements above: you have to choose a move, there is a clock with a limited time, you have to find all the moves to the end, your performance is measured with a rating, no exercise is impossible, and the website doesn't chat with you. But is a two-dimensional screen really similar to a real game? No, but on the other hand it saves a lot of time not having to set up the pieces. It's the same as solving directly from the diagrams in a book. If you don't experience problems, then go ahead. However, there is one big difference to the Woodpecker's Method: the same exercises are not solved again. And remember that Hagen improved only when he started doing that. Hagen also thinks that the exercises on chess.com are too difficult. He likes the idea of a database with tactical exercises, though. Today's players already have an advantage over the pre computer generation, but it will be nothing compared to the day a big tactical database appears. The database will automatically analyse your solutions and give you new exercises on the themes where you are weak. When children have grown up with such a database, they will become tactical monsters. At least this is what Hagen thinks. Tactical motifs One good book that covers tactical motifs in detail is Understanding Chess Tactics (2007) by Martin Weteschnik. It was one of the first books that Tikkanen read. Chapter 6 - The Woodpecker Method 227 It's possible to play a smothered mate without knowing it in advance, and no gain in itself to knowing the name. However, there are reasons to study the tactical motifs. It is simply easier to calculate variations involving a pin, when you already know the standard possible defences. There are many ways to categorize the tactical motifs. I think that most ways will work equally well, but I have chosen the one that strikes me as most logical. The first division is between threats, double threats and other motifs. Before presenting each of the tactical motifs, I have included a block of exercises. You have to work to earn something! I also make it a bit harder by making sure there isn't a clear cut solution in every exercise, thus making it impossible to use the Process of Elimination. I have also proposed a time limit for the exercises. It's set for a player with Elo of about 2300, with the idea that it should be quite stressful! So feel free to adjust as appropriate to your own level. The tactical motifs only need to be carefully studied once. However, it's worthwhile to occasionally think about them when solving exercises, or examining tactical mistakes from your games. Threats A threat is dangerous if the target is undefended or of a higher value than the attacker. Not only pieces, but also squares may be possible targets. However, undefended pieces are by far the most common cause of tactical combinations, so keep an extra eye on them!

Normally, you first see that the piece defends a square or another piece, and only later notice that it really doesn't, since it's pinned. Ideally, the defence should not be seen at all.

When I analyse a game with a friend, sometimes we reach a point where we can't avoid smiling - I enjoy all of chess but some positions are more beautiful than others. For me, beauty in chess is when something unfamiliar works; moves that I normally wouldn't even consider, or positions that I automatically evaluate as unplayable. I like when intuition barks up the wrong tree. This is actually just further proof of how much impact "the chess module" has. I am proud when I occasionally spot a mistake in the module. Zugzwang is a theme that's often surprising if there are a few pieces on the board.

34. ..

g4! This is a good positional move, and it also puts White in zugzwang. a) 35.mfl l'!xb5! 36.l'!xb5 i.d3t is the reason White's king can't move. b) 35.i.fl l'!bl 36.l'!c3 gives Black the option to play ... l'!b l-dlxd4. c) 35.h4 is not a move White wants to play. After 35 ... f5! Black continues with ...mh?, ... l'!b8 and ...g7-g5 to open the h-file for the rook. The attack will be decisive. d) 35.h3 f5! leads to a similar attack. It's even more counterintuitive and beautiful if a zugzwang position arises with the queens on the board.

White is in zugzwang! Instead Semcesen played 53 ...h2 and after 54J!h7, the position is surprisingly only a draw.

[diagram]
a) The game continued 54 ... Ei:fl 55.tt:lxg4 h l =W 56.Ei:xhl Ei:xhl 57.tt:le5 and White didn't have any problems holding a draw. b) 54 ... i.h3 55.Ei:g7t is also not good enough for Black. The king has no good square, so Black has to try 55 ... Ei:g4 56.tt:lxg4 i.xg4

57.Ei:h7.

Now there are a couple of tries: bl) The direct 57 ... i.h3 58.Ei:g7t i>h4 looks like a good start, but 59.i>f4! h l =W 60.Ei:h7# isn't a good finish. b2) 57. .. 'tt> g2 threatens ... i.h3. After 58.Ei:xh2t! 'tt> xh2 59.c4! White will either manage to exchange all Black's pawns, or leave him with only one or two rook pawns and a wrong coloured bishop. Let's go back to the position after 53 ...a5 and analyse all White's moves, to check whether he is in zugzwang.

There are quite a few moves to consider: a) If White moves the king, there follows

I thought the position was easily winning after 60 ...Bd7! since White can't exchange the last pawn, but the Norwegian IM Geir Sune Tallaksen 0stmoe had his doubts and analysed further. After long analysis, I am finally convinced Black will win eventually. I shall omit the analysis as it is not relevant to my main point. To figure out all the hidden tactics in this multiple zugzwang position gave me a lot of joy, and it doesn't concern me that the position is not a simple win at the end. What a fantastic game chess is! Tallaksen 0stmoe became inspired when he saw this game and created a beautiful study. His creation is even better - reciprocal zugzwang but anyhow it's something special that such a position really appeared in a game. Tallaksen 2013

Chapter 6 - The Woodpecker Method 257 SummaryofTactical Motifs Congratulations if you have read this far! One of the previous examples (Exercise 29 on page 243) illustrates why it's useful to know the tactical motifs by heart.

[diagram]
When I have used this exercise in training sessions, a vast majority of the students have "solved" it with I .d5, only to discover that their pin was transformed into a nasty discovered attack. However, that's often the case if the two distant pieces can move in the same direction. That's easier to see if you are well acquainted with the tactical motifs. Threats I ) Shutting in 2) Magnet 3) Removing the defender 4) Opening files, ranks or diagonals 5) Gain of tempo Other motifs I ) Pawn promotion 2) Stalemate 3) Zugzwang Double threats I ) Fork 2) Discovered attack 3) Pin Defences I) Counter-threat 2) Lifeline A final example As the name reveals, there are usually many tactical motifs involved in a combination. This has also been the case in most of the examples above. However, we have seen nothing like the following game. The first moves may not be so difficult, but there will follow a few beautiful and surprising moves later in the line. The solution includes more than half of the tactical motifs. Many of them several times, but I will only mention each once. White is to move. To practise decision making, don't use more than 20 minutes.

This time, there is no doubt that White will win with the queen against two rooks. A position is seldom so rich - almost all of the tactical motifs at once! There is little doubt that knowing the tactical motifs helps to see themes faster. The next step, when following The Woodpecker Method, is to find a puzzle book with quite simple exercises, and solve them over and over again. Tactical exercises The final part of this chapter consists of fifteen complicated exercises. They are some of my favourites, so handle them with care! The exercises will highlight many of the techniques that were discussed in Chapter 4, about calculation. It must be said that some of the exercises are quite difficult, but they are not impossible. Give yourself a maximum of 45 minutes for each batch of three exercises 37-39, 40-42, 43-45, 46-48 and 49-5 1 - so 5 sessions, each no longer than 45 minutes. (This time limit is still designed for a player with a rating of about 2300, so feel free to change it if necessary.) Remember the rules from the beginning of the chapter: 1) You have to solve them in order. 2) You have to choose a move even if you don't think you have found the solution. (If you remember what I wrote in the beginning of the chapter, some of them might not even have a solution!) 3) You have to decide on a move in all the exercises before your 'flag' has fallen. Otherwise, you lose on time. The third block (numbers 43-45) has pawn endings as a theme. They are ideal when practising the skill of accurately calculating long lines. There is a rumour that the Swedish Grandmaster Tiger Hillarp spent a year on the Faroe Islands, only examining pawn endgames - this is too appealing to check if it's true! Good luck!

Danish Team Championship, Copenhagen 20 1 0 Black is threatening 2 5. .. ttld6, winning a piece. White can't move the rook due to 25 ... ttlxg3, so he should defend the rook or move the queen from the discovered attack or move the bishop. Plausible candidate moves are 25.'1&d1,

25.'\Nf3, 25. .ld3, 25.Bb3 and 25.ttlf3. When

looking for candidate moves, hopefully the idea of attacking Black's king with 25 . .lxf7t also enters your mind. Since it's the most forcing option, it's the move to start calculating. 25 . .bf/t!

25.ttlf3 was played in the game.

25 ...�xf7 26.'�c4t This is White's idea, which stops Black's king from going back to g8. 26 ...�£6 Black's king is in danger but how to continue the attack? A check with the queen on the f-file seems devastating. Both 27.'1&b3 and 27.'1&d3 threaten such a check, but the latter seems better since it also threatens the knight.

Intuition can easily exclude such a move automatically, since it loses a pawn close to the king with check. Such intuition has to be questioned. At least, you should not be satisfied without formulating the statement: 'I can't play 7.ltldb5! since I lose a pawn with check'. By thinking like that, you give yourself time to question if it's true. 7 ...Lf2t Black also has 7 ... ltld5 but after 8.ll:le4 the position is simply better for White compared to the 7 . .Be3 line. He also has 7 ...a6, but if this is best then

It's seems that it's faster to go with the a-pawn, since it would also stop Black from promoting with check. However, the queen must go to b8 anyway, to defend the pawn on h2. Thus both options are equal in terms of tempos. The difference is the pawn that is left. I would prefer to leave the a-pawn, since it has advanced furthest.

54.\tlh5 li?xe4 55.\tlg6 li?f4 56.\tlxg7 \tlg5!

Solve simple exercises sorted into themes, and arrange it as a competition: use a chess clock, a points system, and remember that you don't have to find the solution to every exercise.

Levels of ambition In his book Profession: Chessplayer Vladimir Tukmakov argues that it's most important to learn standard positions by playing through illustrative games. He is not alone, but the approach I propose in this chapter is based heavily on concrete analysis and thus is fundamentally different. With my approach, you can still learn typical middlegame positions in a satisfying way. There is a similar clash of approaches between learning just one opening very well or playing many different openings. I advocate the latter. It makes it possible to choose an opening based on the opponent's strength, time management and style of play. At the same time, the opponent can barely prepare at all. However, my most important argument for playing many openings is that it's a good way to learn about all kinds of positions. I know there are disadvantages with my approach. One, which I don't consider too serious, is that you get very dependent on preparations. If you play many different lines, you have to refresh your memory before every game. In rapid tournaments, that's often not possible. In the 20 1 2 Swedish Championship, I played different openings in all nine games and managed to stay undefeated and shared first to fourth place. The tiebreak was decided by rapid games,

where there was no time for real preparations. I had opening catastrophes in the two first games and didn't stand a chance. Another disadvantage is of course that you need to continue working, to keep all the openings under control. It's a common trait among humans to believe that there will be a lot of free time in the future. The near future is filled with obligatory things, but later, there will be more freedom. When we reach "later", things have changed ... Ifwe want to play several openings, and do it well, we have to find that time now. This chapter will be useful even for players who have less time or less interest in working on their openings. The analysis can still be made in the same way, the preparations are similar and I think it will be useful for everyone to work with "opening files", even if they are small ones. Below, I list five possible levels of opening ambitions. I) Creating some "opening files" in ChessBase. The first moves in your previous games are saved in the files, to know how to play if an opponent repeats what you have played earlier. 2) Trying to get a repertoire that covers most of the openings you play, and checking the common moves among top players in the Reference database. 3) Doing some analysis ofyour own, to have some ideas that will surprise opponents. It's especially important to deviate from the games you have in the TWIC-database. 4) Checking the opening files against new books, to catch out players who follow these books. Looking for novelties everywhere, to surprise any opponent. 5) Trying to build comprehensive opening files so that you seldom need to analyse during a tournament. There is nothing wrong with having even lower ambitions than the first level, but for the purpose of this chapter, it's best to start there. I think very few 2400-players reach level two or three, and reaching the final step might just be a dream for most. For example, it's regularly possible to read about Super-GMs who, fifteen minutes before the round, find out that their line is unplayable. Still, I believe it's helpful to have defined those levels. Nils Grandelius and I started to train together when he was twelve. I was seven years older, but he was already higher rated. Two years later, in April 2008, I gave him the task of creating a small opening file for the Berlin with 4.d3 Bc5 5.Bxc6, a variation where understanding is much more important than concrete analysis. Before he showed me the opening file, he played it against me and got an advantage! At that time he was still a child and didn't really work on chess on his own. I know my memories are rose-tinted, but just two years later I think he had reached the final level on the list above. Chapter 7 - Openings 283 Since then, he has built one of the most feared opening repertoires in Sweden. The good news is that Grandelius is still following all of the principles in this chapter. Opening files In addition to a database with your own games, and one to search for games of opponents, it's good to have a working database, a database with top-level games and, of course, opening databases. I have written about them in the appendix at the end of the chapter. An opening file is like a small opening book. A justified question is therefore: isn't it just easier to use a real book? The logistical problem of travelling to tournaments with a backpack filled with opening books is solvable, but the most important reason to save openings in a database is the possibility to personalize it. You can promote lines you are planning to play, it's possible to analyse new moves and to add personal remarks. The following steps summarize the process of creating an opening file. My analysis of the illustrative line, the Anti-Slav variation starting with J.t;)f3 d5 2.g3 t;)f6 3 • .Bg2 c6 4.c4 dxc4, mostly stems from January 20 10, when I was the second for Grandelius in Wijk aan Zee. 1) Choose a good opening Dubious lines may work from time to time, but in the long run it's best for your chess development to play what the grandmasters play. I guess no one has heard of a junior soccer team playing 4-2-4. It may very well give good results in beginner's soccer, when they haven't the skill to use the midfield to build up the play, but somehow it's against the spirit of the game. To start with lLlf3, g2-g3, i.g2 and O-O looks quite harmless, which it really is if White continues with d2-d3 in King's Indian fashion. It's more active, and better, to follow up with c2-c4 and d2- d4, with the idea of transposing into a Catalan structure. So why not start with l .d4 and meet the Queen's Gambit with the Catalan? There are three reasons to start by fianchettoing and castling, then only afterwards pushing d2-d4. 1) It avoids ... i.b4(t) This bishop move is played in many lines of the Catalan, the Bogo-Indian and not least in the Nimzo-lndian. 2) It avoids an early ... dxc4 This is also a common theme for Black in the Slav, Open Catalan, Queen's Gambit Accepted and also the Griinfeld. 3) It avoids an early ... cxd4 In many openings Black "threatens" ... cxd4 and forces White to push d4-d5. This happens in the Benko Gambit and in all the Benoni lines.

4.c4 dxc4). The last line is the example in this chapter.

Teimour Radjabov is one top grandmaster who has used the move order starting with I .liJf3 and

2.g3. It's definitively a serious try.

2) Finding a book or a DVD It is possible but rather impractical to reinvent the wheel - so a good book is an excellent first source to learn from. When I studied the Anti-Slav in Mostar, from August to September 2008, I only knew a few books mentioning the move order. A few years later a magnificent work by Mihail Marin appeared. The book you choose should teach the most important positional ideas. The main characteristic for the Anti-Slav variation is the fianchettoed bishop. There are many reasons why it's so strong: A It defends the king. White always castles short in the Anti-Slav. A It controls a long diagonal. White would love to exchange his c- and d-pawns for Black's c- and d-pawns to open up the diagonal. A It's difficult to threaten the bishop with a knight. In the Anti-Slav, White often gets the bishop pair. Many endgames are thus good for White, since the bishop pair shows its full strength there. There are also some downsides with fianchettoed bishops: A If the bishop is exchanged, the king becomes weak. In the Anti-Slav, Black plays an early ... c6, and will thus probably not castle long. Therefore, White doesn't have to be afraid of an attack on his king. A A pawn must be moved to develop the bishop to g2. I think this is the main disadvantage. l .e4 is also a pawn move that opens up the bishop, but in addition it controls the centre;

2.g3 does not.

[diagram]

2.g3

White chooses to play with a fianchettoed bishop, with the pluses and minuses that were discussed above.

[diagram]
Again, the most logical move, developing the knight to its most active square. 3 . .Bg2 c6 This is a mysterious move. It doesn't develop a piece, occupy the centre or prepare castling. Black's thought processes can be summarized in the following five steps: 1) I don't want to fianchetto my king's bishop, so I have to move the e-pawn to develop it. (What a boring player!) 2) For the moment I can't play 3 ...e5. I don't want to prepare it with 3 ... tLlc6 since White answers with 4.d4. In d4-openings, the knight doesn't want to block the c-pawn, neither for White nor for Black. (There are a lot of exceptions, but in general this is a reasonable thought.) 3) I can't see any other good moves preparing ...e5, so later I have to play ...e6. (That's right.) 4) I don't want to leave the bishop on c8 - it seems too passive! (A matter of taste, but there doesn't seem to be anything wrong with this player's taste.) 5) Both f5 and g4 seem to be reasonable squares for the bishop, but can I really weaken b7 so early? I am afraid that White will quickly play moves like c2-c4, Wfb3 and tLlc3. (A fine sense of danger - White really would do this.) 6) Let's start with 3 ... c6. 1t defends the d-pawn. IfWhite castles and I develop the bishop next move, he is one tempo slower if he tries the same queenside pressure. (Nice reasoning - this is a player who knows why he plays his first moves!)

4.c4

The logic behind this move is exactly the same as behind 3 ...c6. White wants to stop Black from developing the c8-bishop by being ready to attack b 7. 4 •. . dxc4 Black is consistent and holds true to his three maxims: No fianchettoed bishop; Do not play ... e6 before the light-squared bishop has developed; Avoid ... .tg4 or ... .tf5 when White has direct pressure against b 7. 4 ...dxc4 takes a pawn and tries to punish White's play. Black will try to hold on to the pawn, since if White recaptures it without making any concessions, he will have a pleasant position with two centre pawns against one. 3) Inputting the chosen lines After you have read the opening book and decided which lines suit you best, it's time to input the moves, evaluations and the valuable

text comments into a game in ChessBase. It's better to write more text than less; text comments make it much easier to remember. Here is one example from the highest possible level. Viswanathan Anand -Veselin Topalov World Championship, Sofia 25th April 20 1 0

White is temporarily a pawn up, but Black will probably manage to win it back. White's idea is to open up the queenside, since Black's bishop on g6 is completely out of play. Instead of 1 3.<;t>e l , everyone goes to c2, but I think the king is safer on f2. White's first task is to complete development with Be2 and <;t>f2, but in which order? The analysis engines indicate that 1 5.Be2 is best. It would be easy to be satisfied with that, but it would be hard to remember in a game, which might be played several months later. Chapter 7 - Openings 287 It's difficult for humans to remember plain moves, but easy to remember verbal concepts. To add a text comment after 1 5.j,e2, we need to understand why it's better.

own! If two moves are of equal value, it's better to choose the one that isn't mentioned in the book. Ideas of your own give a competitive advantage over the board, at least on the clock. To deviate from opening books is a most common reason to analyse. A new top game in TWIC that seems to develop the theory is another reason, or when a future opponent has played a move that's not mentioned in the opening file. However, there doesn't have to be a specific reason to start analysing! The next part of the chapter covers the craft of analysis. 6) Comparing with other sources Many players follow specific opening books. To check those books and prepare novelties against them gives an enormous advantage in tournament games. The bad news is that theory continues to develop, and new opening books appear. A serious player needs to keep up to date. It's also good to check the opening file against new TWIC-games in the Reference-database from time to time. How often depends on the opening; in fashionable lines, one tournament can completely alter the existing theory, but in others, not much has happened during the last century. An opening file When I thought I understood the concept of the Ami-Slav, I made an opening file. There was no book on this line, so the main source, except my analysis, was grandmaster games. In the following months I updated the file when a relevant new top-level game appeared or when I had played a game. Below is what the opening file looked like. Since I share my opening files with friends, I have always tried to write so that others could understand my files.

So this was my opening file in early 20 1 0, excluding the analysis of the main tabiya after 1 l .E:e 1 , which is found later in the chapter. Later, I read Marin's book and found some improvements there. When they were clearly better, or when I already had "my" move in the TWIC-database, I changed to Marin's line. If the moves were of equal value, I didn't choose Marin's move, since a new move gives more surprise value. Summary It's good to save the repertoire in opening files. It makes it easier to get an overview over the repertoire and to analyse critical positions. The first step is to choose a good opening and a good book. Especially, you should examine the first moves very carefully! Type the lines that you plan to play into ChessBase. This might be enough even for an ambitious player. The next step is to search for fresh, relevant games, and if possible, also check new opening books. Analyse the critical positions - it's always good to have ideas of your own to surprise your opponents. Structure of the databases If all the analysis is saved in one single game file, it's almost impossible to get an overview. It's better to divide your analysis in a lot of different databases and games, and have one database per opening, like in Figure 1 . I have given them flags mainly because I like colours. In the database, every game represents one opening variation. Related variations are placed beside each other, and empty games and headers are used to get an easy overview, like in Figure 2 [A] . !CBerlin atalan

VCs A30 res A30 vcs A30 To be able to survey the opening file easily, I think 200 to 500 half moves is ideal. If a game gets too big, it is better split in two [A] . position you like, although unclear or equal, or to force the opponent to find a lot of difficult moves before he reaches equality. If the line is many moves away from existing theory, there is a great probability that he won't find the best moves over the board. And if he steers his way through the minefield, he will at least be far behind on the clock. Analysing The following section will discuss how to analyse with an engine. To illustrate, I'll give examples from the critical position in the Anti-Slav. The examples are all put together in the end of the section, creating the complete opening file. The first step is setting a goal, normally to get an advantage with White or equality with Black. However, other factors can also be included, like getting positions with a lot of play or getting sterile positions. It depends on what type of opponent the opening is prepared for. If it isn't possible to find an advantage with White, which is often the case, you have to change the goal. It might be either to get a I really believe in the latter approach, which might be called "One-Game-Preparations". If I have played a novelty and the game has been published in the TWIC-database, it's often time to change. The secret is always finding new variations. The main line of the Anti-Slav is an example of a One-Game-Preparation.

It is time to assess the position, but not with an engine. Instead, the question to ask is: "What do I think about this position? Is it something I want to play in a game?'' White is an exchange down but has three extra pawns. Normally, this is very good, but there are some things to worry about. White's extra Chapter 7 - Openings 299 pawns are not the best - three pawn islands and only one passed pawn. Black controls the only open file and if he manages to exchange rooks, he may attack the queenside pawns.

According to the engine, White is slightly better. I am not certain of that evaluation - Black seems to have a lot of potential if he manages to regroup and use both rooks. I can't see any clear way to attack the king, or to use either of the two extra pawns. It's difficult to analyse further. If I choose 20.Bg2, I get a position I don't really like, where I have to continue playing on my own. Let's try 20.Bxa8. Before continuing with that move, I want to mention the most important method of analysing. The x-technique When an analysis engine is running in ChessBase, it's possible to press "x" to give the move to the opponent. The idea is to check whether there is a threat in the position; knowing that makes it much easier to assess the position. Quite often, it happens that there is a threat, but you don't understand why it wasn't possible already one move earlier. In that case, it's a good idea to go back and check that line. Type in a null-move for one of the players and try executing the threat [A] . The method is explained in detail below. To me, there is no doubt that the x-technique is the most useful analysing method.

[diagram]
The engine gives many moves for White, all with some initiative. When I saw that one of the first was 23.h3, I became curious. Why is that a good move?

23.h3

I played the move and pressed "x". The engine claimed that White should play 24.1'!c3 with +0.80. So why not play 1'!c3 one move earlier? I went back, tried it and saw that 23 ...e5 was Black's best reply. So what happens after 23.h3! -- 24.1'!c3 e5? To see that, you have to enter a null-move (Ctrl+Alt+O). After going back and forth a few times, it's possible to see why h2-h3 helps. The main difference arises after: 23.1'!c3 e5 24.Aa3t <it>d8

With h2-h3 played, White would have a safe square for the king on h2. Without h2- h3, there either follows a queen exchange after

30.<it>h3 or counterplay after 30.f3 e4.

26.d3!

I understood that this move is good to stop ... Wfel -e4, but I wanted to know exactly what the threat was. I used the same technique as above, pressing x, to see what White is threatening - 27.1'!e8t <it>d6 28.\Rf7. Then I tried that line on the 26th move, and saw his defence - 27 ... Ag7. So I checked it one move later. It turned out that 26.1'!e8t <it>d6 27.\Rf7 Bg7

28.1'!e7 Bf6! was the main difference. Black

This position leads to the next section. Is it time to stop or should you analyse a few moves deeper? Stopping when the branches get too big The aim with calculation is to find a way through the tactics, then assess the position only when it's of a positional nature. Analysis has the same aim. The engine is used when there are tactical possibilities. When the position has calmed down, it's possible to make a human assessment. Unfortunately there are often new tactics appearing all the time. For that reason, it's difficult to know when to stop. When the difference between the best and second best moves is high, it makes sense to continue. However, if several of the opponent's moves are of about equal strength, it's an indication that it's time to stop. Not only does it become much more difficult to analyse further, but it also becomes hard to remember the analysis for use in a later game. Without that, the analysis loses some of its meaning. In the position above, it's time to stop and make an evaluation, since Black has a few moves of about the same strength. The engine gives White a winning advantage. As I can't see how Black could try to develop his bishop and rook, I see no reason to question that. However, I also notice that the engine gives f4- f5 as White's next move. In most cases, I think it's good to end the analysis with a move of your own. When the opponent has made a move, you only need to analyse one move to extend the variation one ply. That is not the case after one of your moves. In summary, the four principles when analysing are:

Ending every line with an evaluation If a prepared position is reached in a game, it helps a lot to know the evaluation - if it's winning, a small advantage or even worse. If you know that a position is winning, it's easier to set high goals when calculating and to reject moves that don't fulfil those aims. As mentioned in the chapter about tactics, I do not recommend using the Process of Elimination when calculating in normal positions, but in a sense, it can be used in positions immediately after your preparation. Here is one example. Analysis of the critical position - fifth example I.tLlf3 d5 2.g3 tLlf6 3.i.g2 c6 4.c4! dxc4

.tb4 I should, first of all, have blamed myself for not checking this natural defence, but hopefully I should quickly put aside such irrelevant thoughts and think about the next move. It's much easier to find the correct line with the knowledge that White is winning. White is a rook down, so there must be something brutal! It's thus reasonable to avoid considering a calm move like 19.a3. The bishop is trapped, but it's not possible to capture it on the next move. My intuition tells me that this is not "a winning move".

Black is helpless. The three principles when cleaning up the analysis are: All important points are annotated with text Irrelevant variations are removed Every line ends with an evaluation Chapter 7 - Openings 305 Summary Start by setting a goal. It may be getting an advantage or forcing the opponent to find some difficult moves. Analyse the position like in a normal game. 1) Look for human candidate moves and start by analysing the one that seems strongest. 2) Use the x-technique to see threats for both sides. 3) Stop when there are too many moves of about the same value. 4) End with a move of your own and make a human evaluation. 5) However, mark it with an Informant symbol (;!; or ± and so on) in most cases, but comment upon all important points with text. 6) The goal is to make the opening file as easy to survey as possible. For that reason, remove irrelevant variations. They impair readability. Finally - Ta-da! Here is the final opening file for the critical position of the Anti-Slav variation.

Another reason to push the bishop back is that it allows f3-f4 as a reply to ... lt::l e5 without weakening e4 too much - the knight on c3 is no longer pinned.

Since Black didn't have many choices in the lines, it didn't take much time to analyse. I think my choice of move is quite practical - I rejected the engine's two preferred moves since I don't like the resulting positions.

Black has coordination problems. Overall, I think the secret is not being satisfied with a move like 14.'1Mfc3. White did not play the knight to e2 to exchange queens, but to challenge the knight on h5. The engine doesn't take long to point out that 1 5.lLlxh5 is bad. I instead concentrated on 1 5 .lLlc6 for some time before I tested sacrificing the piece. I sacrificed simply because I was curious to know the knight's answer to my question! Quite soon, it was clear that White had interesting compensation. One of my students left his engine running in the position after 14 ...e5 while he went skiing. The piece sacrifice was proposed when he came back. It seems that the engine starts to understand something when it has reached depth 23. However, it's not possible to go skiing between every move! Computers are rapidly getting better, and I guess the engine will soon spot the solution without needing much time. Even so, I must again emphasize that the working process is at least as important as the resulting moves. I analysed the variation above at Wijk aan Zee in January 20 1 0. Over three years later I still have not had the chance to play the sacrifice. The position after 14 ...e5 has been reached five times over the board without anyone playing 1 5.<;t>b l !!. I later learned it had been played in 2009 in a correspondence game Florea - Chiricuta. In the sharpest lines, it pays to keep an eye on the games of the top correspondence players. Remembering It is tiresome to hear many chess players complaining about their weak memories. There is nothing strange about forgetting your preparation one time or another. Everyone does. I rather think it's impressive that many remember dozens and dozens of moves, while barely trying! Chapter 7 - Openings 3 1 7 When learning a language, it's said that a word has to be rehearsed between 50 and 1 00 times to be learned by heart. Before school exams, students check if they know the words time after time. When studying openings, the lines are usually rehearsed just a few times. Often, it's even done in a passive way. With such an attitude, it's not surprising if your memory works worse than it used to before exams. Passive and active memory are two different things - recognizing something and recalling it. In chess games, the two memories are combined. The next moves need not be remembered until the position is on the board, but by then you have no further hints. You practise the passive memory when you click through the opening. Instead, I think it's important to recall the moves while preparing. This is done most easily with the Training function in ChessBase [A] . Also remember to see the board from the same side as in the upcoming game. Personally, I like to print out my opening files and study them on a real board. We remember things from each of the five senses, and it's thus much easier to remember a phenomenon that includes several of them. Chess moves seldom have a specific taste or smell, so those options fall away. Nevertheless, the view of the board can be combined with the sense of moving the piece, and even speaking it out loud or quietly in your head. If a computer is used, I strongly recommend making the moves with the mouse. There is a greater risk of forgetting if you are lazy and just use the right-arrow on the keyboard - if you do that, then it is the computer that is remembering the moves; you are just pressing buttons. The human memory is much better at storing verbal concepts than pure facts, so it's important to think why the moves are played. Repetition may be the mother of all knowledge, but only if it's done in the right way. Chess players often rehearse opening moves while preparing for games, but the process can be made much more systematic than that. Let's say that a new opening is analysed, and an opening file is created. The first repetition takes place already when the file is cleaned up afterwards. According to memory scientists, repetitions should then be made after one day, one week, one month and six months. Most of those repetitions come naturally when preparing for games at tournaments, but I think it would be time well-invested to use some hours to play through the opening files one day and one week after they are created. Before a tournament, it may be useful to think about the choice of openings. If some special openings are planned, it's good to use one day to rehearse them. It also gives the mind some time to adapt to the style of play. Most chess players can be proud of their memory, even if they complain about it. But rehearsing in a more structured way would get even better results. Having a specialized memory is probably quite usual when a lot of time is spent on an activity, and there are some remarkable examples. One evening, a bridge player in Australia noticed that he had exactly the same cards as in a competition two years earlier. He concluded that the organizers had used the same pairing key as back then. He could not only tell all his upcoming cards, but also all the cards of his partners for the rest of the evening! The story ended surprisingly: he was disqualified and thus punished for his strong memory. 3 1 8 Pump Up Your Rating Preparing Gettin g as much information as possible In principle, it is good to get as much information as possible about your opponent and the opening you will play against him, while he gets as little information as possible. However, this advice can be interpreted in more or less strict ways. I am an addict regarding preparation. In rapid tournaments, with only short pauses between the rounds, I prepare in advance for all the top players with both colours. That is nothing compared to what I do in the Swedish League. There it's possible to rotate the team setup, which sometimes gives seven possible opponents. While most players feel that it's too much to prepare for everyone, I see my chance. I start by checking the games in my main database, which I call Gigabase, but nowadays there are sometimes additional games at http://ratings.fide.com. I also have another secret method to find games: the ICC. Many people play under their real names, and it's possible to search for a player (tell findname name Axel Smith) and his relevant games (search Smith Al l). It can be very useful! Before one of the games in the Swedish League, I found a hole in an opponent's repertoire after seeing his ICC games. I used a few days to study a new opening before that game and was quite optimistic. Sadly, I was paired against one of the other possible opponents. Anyway, my preparations gave satisfYing results. That season I was on average 30 minutes up on the clock after the opening. However, I must also mention what many friends tell me: that I focus too much on opening preparation. One time, when I was at an airport on the way to a round robin rapid tournament, I suddenly found the starting list of 32 players. I immediately started preparing with both colours against all the players, but it took more time than expected and I was 45 minutes late for the flight. In that case I will admit I focused too much on my preparations, but in general I don't think it's a problem for me. It's important, though, to feel that the preparations aren't taking energy away from the game. By the way, the flight was miraculously waiting for me, and I earned back the minutes lost during the opening phases in the games in the tournament! Deciding which opening to play By having more than one opening in your repertoire, it's possible to make a targeted preparation. It's even easier if the opponent consistently plays the same openings. Start by picking the most recent games with the relevant colour [A] . Sometimes that means one year and sometimes the last 1 5 games; that is only a preference. Instead of checking all games one by one, it's easier to create an "opening book" in ChessBase [A] . The relevant question is of course which openings the opponent seems to play well and which he seems to play less well. Do you know how to play against his favourite lines? Personally, I don't want to spend energy during a tournament analysing opening lines, so if he plays something I am unfamiliar with, I'd rather go for another opening. Chapter 7 - Openings 3 1 9 However, there are also a lot o fother things to consider when choosing what to play: J..If you play a higher-rated opponent, and neither of you has any clear weak points in your repertoire, it's good to play an opening with a lot of theory. That increases the chance that the game will be decided in the opening phase, or that there is not much play left when the opening phase is over. J..With the same reasoning, it's better to choose openings with more positional decisions against lower-rated opponents. The idea is that playing strength will have a greater influence. J..Choose openings with few theoretical moves against time trouble addicts, so they start to spend their time early in the game. J..Opponents with an active playing style might dislike solid openings, and vice versa. Of course, such considerations must be weighed against the risk of choosing something that doesn't suit you! J..It may also be helpful to check the opponent's games with reversed colours. Does he play the opening you have planned to play against him? It also shows what type of positions he has experience with. It's good to find what he enjoys least. One last piece of advice is very important - imagine the opponent's situation. What information does he have? It's important to know which of your own games have been published in TWIC, especially when you get surprised. In such situations, it's generally good to deviate as early as possible. With all information in hand, the opening choice usually makes itself Personally, I try to decide which opening to play the evening before the game. It gives something interesting to think about when trying to sleep ... but also reduces stress and gives a feeling of how much time the preparations will take. Rehearsing the lines Finally, I check all of my opponent's games (I have not played Victor Korchnoi yet, who has 5000 games) and make a list of the openings I have to rehearse. I prefer to save the list in a game in ChessBase, since it makes it easy to retrieve the preparations for the next game against the same opponent. If the opponent has played something that isn't mentioned in the book or in the opening file, it has to be analysed. This should be done before rehearsing lines, since the final evaluation of the analysis may change the opening choice. If there is nothing to analyse, it's time to start going through the opening files and rehearsing the moves. Actively - not in bed! I prefer doing this only on the morning before the game, so my memory keeps the variations fresher in my mind. Start with the most probable opening; something may happen that makes it impossible to rehearse every line. However, starting with the most probable opening may also give a chance to check that opening file for a second time. Personally, I usually spend about three hours to rehearse 3000 half-moves. My memory is easily disturbed, so I try to avoid thinking of other things after the end of my preparations until the opening phase is over.

Some players think that it's bad to play fast in the opening, since it reveals what's prepared. However, a friend of mine does the opposite: he plays fast when he is out of book, to trick the opponent into thinking it is still preparation. There are already two ways to interpret slow play (prepared or not prepared) and fast play (prepared or not prepared). So I think it's better not to bother trying time-management tricks in the opening - just play the prepared moves as quickly as possible and save the valuable seconds for later in the game! Below is a checklist for preparing for a game. The time schedule works when the tournament has one game per day, starting in the afternoon, as in most serious tournaments. 1) Create the opening files. Long before the tournament 2) Download the latest TWIC-games and update the The day before the tournament Gigabase. 3) Search for relevant games of the opponent (Gigabase, fide.com, ICC). 4) Make an opening book with his latest games with the relevant colour; maybe 1 5 games or a full year. Check When the pairings are published what openings he plays and think if you would like meeting them. 5) Check your own games and think what he is probably preparing against you. 6) Decide which opening to play. 7) Check more (maybe all) of his games to see whether there are relevant games. Write down a list of lines to The evening before the game prepare and analyse. 8) Analyse, if needed. The final evaluation of the analysis may change the choice of opening. 9) Rehearse the opening files, starting with the most The morning before the game important opening.

The game was played in the last round of the Bosna Open in May 20 1 1 . 1he games from 2010 and the beginning of 201 1 (30 games) show that he plays at least four diffe rent Sicilian variations.

Chapter 7 - Openings 32 1 met any g3-tries in his recent games. Adding the games from 2008 and 2009 doesn't give anything either. When checking all his games, he seems to go into an Anti-Catalan, which I gladly play. I prefer to start with 1.c4 0.f6 2. 0.j3 e6 3.g3 rather than 1. 0.j3 0.f6 2.g3, since the latter allows J...d5. Black can then play systems with ... !J.j5 or ... !J.g4 without being forced to play ... c6. The only possible disadvantage with 1.c4 is l...e5, but he has never played that move. With White, Perunovic plays only J.e4, so he may not have much experience in the English lines with g2-g3. What shall I prepare? Let's check his recent games again. a) Symmetrical English. I will play a move order that avoids the Hedgehog. It might trampose to the Nimzo-lndian, but that's fine. I believe in my analysis there. I have never used that move order before, so he can't prepare agaimt it! b) Anti-Catalan. Checking all his games, he has never played agaimt the line I have in my repertoire. Also, I haven't showed it in TWIC I will check the opening file. c) He has played a lot of Slavs in recent tournaments. Maybe I will check the Anti Slav line briefly.

Two bishops against a knight - one of the theoretical endgames on my list. I had learned that it's best to defend with the king on b6 or c7 and the knight on b7. White is able to break down such a setup and force Black's king out into the middle, but it's very difficult to stop him from then setting it up in another corner. From one of those corner positions, it should take slightly less than 50 moves to capture the knight with perfect play. Both my friend and I chose this position for our competitions, and neither of us managed to win. Nevertheless, I was optimistic during the game, especially when my opponent offered a draw.

Queen and pawn versus queen Studying queen-and-pawn versus queen is time well spent, since it's common in tournament games and quite simple to learn. Even after having studied it, it's still easy to misplay the ending over the board, but knowing the basic rules makes it much easier. Queen endings usually involve a lot of checks, but with some pawns on the board, the king is usually able to move across the board to find a hiding place. Even with only a queen and a pawn to hide behind, the winning chances are high. Pawns on one of the four central files are usually winning. The exception is, of course, if the pawn is lost or if there is an immediate perpetual, but also if the defending king manages to block the pawn from advancing. The best defensive option for the king is to stand in front of the pawn (without getting checkmated!) because then a queen exchange leads to a draw, but it may also be sufficient just to stay close. Pure calculation has to answer the question if it's close enough. If the pawn can move, it's not difficult to advance it to the seventh rank. After that, the winning method is to stop the checks with a countercheck, forcing the exchange of queens. The placement of the defending king is therefore of decisive importance. It has to be far away, to avoid such counter-checks. There are two rules to know: I } With rook and knight pawns, it's a draw with the defending king in the opposite corner. 2) With rook pawns, it's a draw with the defending king behind the pawn. Other cases win. The following game illustrates the winning tries and how to defend against them. Axd Smith - Eduard-Andrei Valenu World Junior Championship, Yerevan 2006

[diagram]
This is the key posltlon for the whole endgame. Black has two winning methods: 1 ) To play ... 'kt>hl . White must then either check on the h-file (in this case h6) or pin along the diagonal (d5). If Black can cover both of these squares and follow up with ... 'kt>hl , he wins. The key squares for Black's queen are thus c6, e6 and h5. White should never allow him to reach one of those with check! 2) To play ... 'tt> h3. White has to start checking. In that moment, White's king should not be placed on b8, since it allows Black's queen to counter check on g3. The best square for White's queen is d2 since it covers d5, an ideal square for Black's queen. From d5, it would defend the pawn and at the same time cover the king when it starts advancing across the board, as in the second winning method. The secret to the endgame is to look for the white queen's squares along the diagonal and on the h-file, and then find the key squares for Black's queen. Let's examine White's different moves: a) 75.'1Wf2? From f2, the queen can reach h4 (on the h-file) and f3 (on the diagonal). Both are already covered by Black's queen, so he wins immediately with 75 ... 'tt> hl . However, f2 is a bad square even in general, since it's a great risk that Black can check his queen to e4. b) 75.'1Wa2? is not working at all, since the queen can't reach the h-file. Black wins with 75 ... 'tt> h3 76.'1Wb3t 'kt>h4. c) 75.'1Wb2? is also not good. The queen can reach b7 and h8, which makes h7 and c8 key squares. The problem is the king also wants to use the b7-square. 75 ...

It was the l Oth round in the World Junior Championship, and I had 3/10 after the loss. My mood was at zero when I walked to the hotel through the traffic in Yerevan, and I didn't care about all the cars that honked at me when I crossed the streets. I was also glad to know the hotel restaurant had closed, since I felt I didn't deserve any dinner. The next day I had a bye, and could use the time to study the ending. The next time I get it over the board, I promise I will do better! Summary There are three defensive methods: Case 1: The defending king is close to the pawn Case 2: The defending king is in the opposite corner (this works with rook and knight pawns) Case 3: The defending king is behind the pawn (this works with rook pawns) The second case is the most interesting. One of the winning methods is to check the queen to a key square, which in our example with a black h-pawn is a square that covers all White's queen moves to the h-file and to the long diagonal. In this case, c6, e6 and h5 are key squares. After that, Black plays ... 'it>hl . The second winning method is marching the king to the other side of the board. To increase the possibility for counter-checks, the black queen is best placed on d5, where it also defends the pawn. To avoid this, White should keep his queen on d2. White should also avoid having the king on b8, since it creates the possibility of a counter-check on g3. The position is drawn, but difficult to defend over the board. Queen versus rook Queen versus rook is theoretically won, but very difficult to win against best defence. However, it's much easier to play with the queen than the rook - maybe not that surprisingly! In the games I have found, the stronger side won 76% of the games (and blundered the queen once!). Chapter 8 - Theoretical Endgames 333 Queen versus rook is quite common, with 70 games in TWIC in 20 1 1 . David Navara has played it four times, including his famous game against Alexander Moiseenko where he played until it was mate in four and then offered a draw. Navara had unintentionally touched a piece earlier in the game without moving it and had a guilty conscience. For no reason, if you ask me. It's more practically important to learn how to defend the endgame as toughly as possible, but I will start with the winning method.

I don't want to diminish his efforts, but I think these examples have shown that the endgame is not so difficult to win in a practical game.

The most basic rook endgame is rook and pawn versus rook. Pump Up Your Rating The theory of rook endings starts with the third rank defence (Philidor's position) and Lucena's position. I guess those are very familiar to the reader, otherwise; look them up immediately!

I am one of the few players who prepares during rapid tournaments. If it's a small tournament, I prepare against all the players the day before, but in this game, I prepared between the rounds. Mamedyarov played an opening he had used frequently, so what did I prepare here? Certainly not to accept his draw offer! The game wasn't rated and I was far from getting a prize. When I accepted his draw offer, I missed a valuable experience to play against such a strong opponent. For years I wondered if this draw was worth anything at all. Today, I finally understand the value of this game - I can use it as an example of what not to do. Immediately after the game, I was uneasy about it and had a guilty conscience. At the same time I accepted that it was not so easy to resist the temptation to accept the draw offer. I have seen another comical example of this. When I organized the Swedish Championship in 20 1 0, one of the players had a win by default in the first round. He was extremely upset and demanded compensation. Nothing could really calm him down until we finally found a replacement opponent. Then he started playing, but agreed to a draw after eight moves! So why do many players accept draw offers or offer draws, even in promising positions? Because we are afraid of losing! Obviously, it hurts to lose if we have invested a lot of time, work and ambition in chess. A loss not only means that we get zero points in the game, but it also feels as if we have failed as a person. Of course, we understand that's not really the case, but during a game it's easy to be aff ected by a lot of feelings, like the fear of losing. At the right moment, a draw offer can be a useful tool, but you have to start by learning to fight. The best attitude is to accept that Chapter 9 - Attitude 347 occasional losses are inevitable, but that's easier said than done. After the game against Mamedyarov, I concluded that it's useful to have a strict rule. It could be as simple as never taking draws! The advantage of such a rule is that you never need to spend any time considering draw offers or thinking about offering a draw yoursel£ You can use all your energy to find the best moves. I did follow a no-draw rule for a few years. A few weeks before we became a couple, I played against my wife. No way would she get a draw! Following the rule has given me a lot of experience, with more than 350 losses, but it has above all taught me a lot about chess. As you can see from some of the games in this book, I no longer avoid all draws, but today I know that I have the courage to play for a win in every game against any opponent, when I need to. Some of my students have signed a contract to never take draws. That might take it a bit too far, but I really think it's useful to have rules against accepting draw offers. Time management It's safe to say that many ambitious players play too slowly. I think there are three reasons: I) Players who play fast are often considered unserious and lacking in concentration. 2) Being ambitious means, among other things, searching for the very best moves. That can easily lead to time trouble. 3) The desire to search for the truth, which is often not possible in other parts of life, is also time-consuming. We can easily give up a lot of other things for chess, but we have difficulties giving up chess to win games! Ifyou play competitive chess, time management is really an inherent part, not something that the cat has dragged in. With today's short time controls it's even a very important part of the game! And it's a difficult part: there are a lot of difficult decisions in a very limited time. Players who play fast are not unserious, they are pragmatic. It's important to accept that such an attitude is necessary, even in chess. The main aim in this section is therefore to talk about how to avoid time trouble. I used to have a lot of problems with time management. My List of Mistakes shows that I played too slowly in one third of my games in the spring of2008. I decided to check my time management, so during a few tournaments I wrote down the time on the scoresheet after every move. When I analysed the findings, I realized how many mistakes I made due to bad time management. Nine times, I blundered in time trouble. In the same period, I didn't play too fast even once! Many players write down how much time they use during their games, but very few analyse it. I really recommend doing that. For myself, it gave me enough motivation to change my approach to time management. The first step was to decide to hunt for every second. I have not yet stopped and guess I never will. It's so damned difficult to hold on to the seconds I catch! A first concrete rule is never to be late for a game. An equally obvious one is to avoid spending time watching other games in the tournament or thinking about things other than chess. It's not easy, but the first step is deciding to try. If I catch myself thinking about something else, I immediately punish myself for having lost valuable seconds. The game is a fight from the first to the last move. If you know an opening move by heart, you should play it immediately. The same logic is the basis for Leko's rule: When there is only one possible move, play it immediately. It may sound Pump Up Your Rating obvious, but too often I have seen players pondering over only-moves. During the opponent's time, one's thoughts are less concrete and more about general plans. However, if he has a move that is quite probable, it's a good idea to start calculating before he plays it. To be able to make a quick answer not only saves time, but also stops him from using your time to think! For that reason, I often try to play two quick moves following each other in forced sequences. Three years later, in 20 1 1 , I had still not managed to hold on to any seconds, but I had learned to play fast in positions that weren't critical. And that is the most important advice I can offer - try to play fast in positions that aren't critical. It's acceptable to not play the best move in every position. I analysed my time management once again. This time it looked like this: Time Ma nagement Copenhagen Chess Challenge 201 1 (Minutes per move, 9 games) 90 minutes + 30 seconds per move I made 75% of the moves in less than one minute plus the 30 seconds of increment. That saved time for the critical moments. The first of them usually arises immediately after the opening. For me, the first move I have to play on my own usually comes after a bit more than ten moves. In the tournament mentioned above, I spent on average 1 5 minutes for that move. I think that's pretty normal. Even though I played most moves in 1 lh minutes or less, I felt that I still had problems with time trouble. For that reason, I decided to check all the positions where I spent at least one sixth of the remaining time and at least six minutes. Was it really necessary to use so much time there? It happened 35 times during the nine games. Most were critical positions, but after having analysed the positions, I think I used too much time in ten of them. I needed to play even faster. I tried solving the problem in two ways. Firstly, I started to use a chess clock when I solved exercises. As I wrote in Chapter 6, I think it's a good idea to have a defined amount of time for several exercises. It forces you to take responsibility to choose a reasonable move in time. If you haven't finished all the exercises when the time is over, you lose on time. Additionally, you can decide to never use more than 20 minutes for an exercise. The idea is learning to avoid perfectionism. The second way was to formulate the following maxim: the consequences of the mistakes made in time trouble should be equal to the consequences of the mistakes caused by playing too fast. It's a radical maxim, but to me it seems that a balance will give the least number of total mistakes. My argument is that the number Chapter 9 - Attitude 349 of mistakes and the seriousness of them will increase exponentially when having less time. Hence, the probability of making a serious mistake is higher if one move is made in 90 seconds and another move in grave time trouble, say 30 seconds, than if two moves are made in 60 seconds each. If this maxim is accepted, it's easier to avoid beating yourself up about a mistake caused by playing too fast. Such mistakes are necessary to avoid making several mistakes in time trouble! Here is one recent example of the approach I advocate. Axel Smith - Igor Teplyi Borup GM, 22th September 20 1 2 Igor Teplyi is a Griinfeld player and, as so often before, I tried to find the move order that he would like least. l.c4 The idea in the Griinfeld is to undermine the centre. By not occupying it with pawns, I give him nothing to attack! l...g6 l ...lt:lf6 is the normal move order. The idea with l ...g6 is later to threaten ...e5 and either play it or force White to return to normal lines with d2-d4.

2.e4!

The downside to Black's move order; Black can no longer play ... lt:lf6 followed by ...d5. 2 ... c5 For Griinfeld players, I think it makes sense to play 2 ...e5 to steer the game away from normal openings. After the game move, it will normally transpose to a Maroczy Bind, which is not part ofTeplyi's repertoire.

7.d6!? was also interesting, to cramp Black's

development. I didn't consider it, probably because I played quite fast. I have accepted that I will miss some interesting possibilities with my approach, but I think the pluses are worth more. I planned to take on d4 next move. If Black takes back with the pawn he closes the diagonal for the g7 -bishop, and if he takes back with the bishop, it might later be attacked. It's therefore logical for Black to exchange on f3. 7 .. JihBt s.Y!Yxf3 d6 9.i.d3 This is a Benoni position where Black has managed to exchange one piece, which is good since he lacks space. On the other hand he has spent a lot of tempos and will need to make another move with his queen. It's also in White's favour that Black hasn't played ... e6xd5 yet. White can consider taking back with the knight, the c-pawn or the e-pawn. So far, so good. I have a slight advantage and plenty of time on the clock. Sadly, later in the game I slowed way down and lost in 45 moves after making a blunder in time trouble! So there is still work to do on my time management. The rest of the game is not so interesting, so I was tempted to omit it, but I shall just give the bare moves as an example of the horrors of time trouble.

0-1 Sometimes there are two moves of about the same strength. Against weaker opponents, it might be a good idea to avoid symmetrical and simplified positions - such decisions often require some extra thought.

8.c4

Black has a comfortable position, but the natural pawn lever ...d5 leads to the exchange of two pairs of pawns and possibly also knights and a few heavy pieces. In the game I instead restricted myself to ...d6 to avoid simplifications. Of course there is still every chance to create something, but I didn't handle that well. The final part of the game can be found later in the chapter. The best advice to avoid getting dull positions against weaker opponents is to be conscious of the risks. However, sometimes it happens anyway but that doesn't have to be the end of the game. Wmning drawish positions The most important advice is to try, try again and then try even more. It's possible to win (and lose!) surprisingly many positions. Let's start with a shocking example. Jon Ludvig Hammer - Pal Reyset Norwegian League, Oslo 1 5th January 20 1 2

I will start with an example I am not particularly proud of. The position looks blocked, but White has space and some ideas to sacrifice a knight. lt:lh4xg6 will not work as long as Black keeps a rook on the h-file and the king on f7, and the pawn on a5 is easily defended with both rooks. The only remaining idea for White is ttJa3/c3-b5. Before executing this move I should double rooks on the a-file.

After 49 moves it's time to move a pawn! Probably you have already realized that I am mostly waiting until time trouble before playing lDb5. This was in the bad old days when we didn't get 30 seconds per move. It's easy to argue that it's unsporting to act like this, and I don't really have a good answer. My only defence is that it was a team competition. The choice between keeping my personal reputation flawless and helping the team is easy, isn't it?

White had three seconds left and Black sixteen. To end the game without ill feeling, I had a nice chat with Malte Burwick afterwards and, yes, I think justice was done in the end. Principle 2: Don't show that you are playing on time. Repetitions should not be made too early, since that makes the opponent aware of the impact of the chess clock. For the same reason, I never write down my opponent's time on my scoresheet. Principle 3: Don't force the position, but look like you are! The longer it's possible to keep many options open, the more time the opponent will use, but only if he thinks that you are trying to create something. Harmless threats can also make him nervous, or perhaps he will try an unjustified active defence. Triangulation is one good way of doing nothing but looking like you are. The opponent often thinks that there is something deep going on. If the opponent only defends passively, which is easy to notice within a few moves, a good positional improvement is to gain space. Often he will continue to stay passive, until he has no choice. The following game is a good example of this.

I have followed Mragel Vrillestad's 'confusion method', named after a chess legend from Lund. The idea is to triangulate in an unforcing position, in order to confuse the opponent. He may think that something deep is going on. It's a natural thought, since here there is no idea at all behind losing the move! When he is given the move, he might overreact to clarify the position. I know this method sounds bizarre, but I have used it several times with good results. A player, who before has only had to react to the

This move must have been what he overlooked. Black is winning, but it took me another 60 moves to finish the game (0- 1 , 1 09 moves) . One circumstance that actually helps if you want to win very drawish positions is if the opponent wants the draw very badly. In those situations, keep on playing, while you give the opponent possibilities to come "closer" to the draw. The four principles outlined in this section are: Principle 1: It's not unsportsmanlike to win on time. Principle 2: Don't show that you are playing on time. Principle 3: Don't force the position, but look like you are! Principle 4: Give the opponent possibilities to go for dubious exchanges. Chapter 9 - Attitude 363 Bad ways of choosing moves Human are not robots (yet) . Normally we are grateful for that fact, but it also allows us to have irrational reasons for choosing moves. Ideally, all feelings should be set aside until the tournament is over, but it's not so easy to avoid letting them influence our thoughts. That's a pity, since chess punishes irrelevant thoughts without mercy. This may not be the machines' only advantage in their fight against humans, but it should not be neglected. However, by being conscious of the possible pitfalls, it's easier to avoid them. Trying to make up for previous mistakes It's very common that a mistake is followed by more mistakes. When feeling uneasy about the situation, it's easy to lose objectivity and set one final cheap trap. In this way, the game is finished as soon as possible, but probably lost. It's never good to try to make up for previous mistakes. The new situation has to be considered as it is, not through a tinted lens. Thinking about others' opinions "What will they say ifl play this stupid-looking move and lose?" is a question that ruins one's self-confidence. The opposite is also possible - playing a move to impress the spectators. I once noticed that one of my students often made his move when I came to watch his game. After that experience, I always watch friends' games from behind, so they can't see me. Not trusting your judgment The consequence is inconsistent play, alternating between plans. Your own judgment may be wrong, but you have nothing better to trust. If you believe that an attack on the king is strategically justified, it should be played. When having a good position against a stronger opponent, anxious feelings may arise. The lower-rated player often becomes cautious to avoid all possible counterplay. Such an attitude must be avoided! Instead, the same mechanism can be used when the tables are turned: when defending a lost position. In those situations it pays to play a bit more aggressively than is objectively justified. The opponent doesn't want "unnecessary'' complications, and he can thus be expected to go for the safe but passive option. Falling in love with a move After having spent a lot of time calculating a move, and maybe even having found some nice tactics, it's easy to get emotionally attached to it. If the calculation ends up with the conclusion that it doesn't work, sometimes it's played anyway! The line of thought, often subconsciously, sounds like: "The opponent will surely not see that much, and if he does, something new may turn up along the way''. No! Never lie to yourself! It's better to throw all emotions away, swallow the frustration and look for a new move. Concentration For me, the main difference between a good and a bad tournament is how well I manage to keep other thoughts away during the games, and I'm quite often dissatisfied with how well I manage. For that reason, I was perplexed and envious when I learned that Viswanathan Anand complained that he had one irrelevant thought during his whole match against Vladimir Kramnik in Bonn 2008! It happened after 22 moves in the 1 Oth game. After Kramnik's 23.'1Wa6! Anand returned to reality (chess!). The truth may not be that black and white, but I like to think of Anand as a good example (though I try not to think of this during a game!). The closest I have come to Anand's Pump Up Your Rating extraordinary concentration was when I washed the car that picked him up when he visited Kristiansund. The Norwegian Grandmaster Jon Ludvig Hammer has pointed out that Magnus Carlsen gets more exhausted than his rivals after a game, despite being physically fitter than most of them. Hammer says he would love to learn how Carlsen manages to give everything. Bobby Fischer, who said he didn't believe in psychology, was nevertheless disturbed by silent cameras. Well, the first step towards good concentration is accepting that external factors have a huge impact. Having come so far, there are several pieces of advice worth following. Goals The most important goals are for the training program. They are discussed in the introduction to the second part of this book. But the goal that's set before a tournament will affect your concentration. Such a goal should be effort-based and short-sighted, not focusing on more than the next game. It's dangerous to have a results-oriented goal, like 'reaching six points'. If your score is 4Yz points before the final round, it may be hard to find motivation, since the goal is unreachable. The same may happen if your score is already 6 points. Rating performance is also a whimsical goal - it depends so much on chance and the play of your opponents. All similar goals increase the risk of having irrelevant thoughts. It's better to have an effort-based goal, such as 'concentrating well'. That kind of goal is always relevant, whatever the results in the previous games. Good concentration depends a lot on your level of motivation. If motivation is a problem, it's a good idea to use one day before the tournament to prepare mentally. One useful thing is to get rid of all the work that is hanging over your head, but it's also good to use some time to think about how it would feel to lose, and then imagine being fully focused, and winning games. Irrelevant thoughts A common mistake is to think way ahead, beyond the game. It might be about the next round, the prize-giving ceremony or the imminent celebration of your inevitable triumph. Another common mistake is to think backwards, re-calculating moves that are long gone or evaluating the opening choice. All our thoughts should deal with the current position! In particular, many players have problems getting over a loss. They constantly ask themselves why they made such a ridiculous mistake, or something similar. This clearly makes it more difficult to focus on the next game. I think it's a good habit to avoid analysing games during the tournament, except for the post-mortem and the opening. The post mortem can't be saved until later, and the opening may be important for forthcoming rounds. Anyway, a game should not be checked with an engine before it has been analysed with a trainer or a training partner, and there is seldom enough time for that between rounds. At first, curiosity demands that you should get 'the answer' immediately, but after some time, you learn to wait. All conclusions and 'blame' are better left until after the tournament. So how should irrelevant thoughts be avoided? The first step is simply deciding that you want to avoid such thoughts. Afterwards, you will automatically start to scold yourself when you discover your mind thinking of something irrelevant. This helps, but it requires practice, just like everything else. There is also a lot of truth behind the old Chapter 9 - Attitude 365 saying " What you do in practice will carry over into competition. " So try to be well-focused when solving exercises. It's possible to practise concentration at home, for example by trying to keep a focused, blank mind during five minutes every day. It is also a good idea to prepare mentally before a tournament, as mentioned previously. Meditation is the next step for the ambitious. Sleep and food It's self-evident that getting enough sleep is important, but how much is enough? Logically, it means waking up before the alarm clock rings. Sleeping time should be planned with some margin. It's also good to follow Hector's principle, named after the Swedish Grandmaster Jonny Hector: In order to get the brain ready, you have to wake up at least two hours before the game. In addition, it saves energy to have fixed routines; all energy can be spent on chess instead of taking other decisions. When I first travelled to a tournament with my Norwegian club, they were stunned to learn that I took sleeping so seriously (boringly!). After that, they could not stop repeating this over and over again, maybe a bit too often. It is not the best idea to tell an eight-year-old kid who is thinking about starting to play chess that he must take great care of his sleep! In contrast, I only follow the two principles mentioned above during tournaments. At home, I never manage to keep a regular daily rhythm - the day is just too short! Ironically, it's the middle of the night as I am writing this, and 42 hours since I slept. The most important thing is, as usual, to take sleep seriously. The game against Teplyi was played in a tournament where the organizer offered tided players "accommodation". I wrote to them to make sure this didn't mean air beds in barracks together with a dozen other players. They answered that it didn't, which was true. I stayed in a small storeroom in a school, without a shower and without the possibility of being there during the day. It was difficult to sleep, with an alarm triggered in the middle of the night and a security guard coming early in the morning. In addition, the room had two gigantic windows without curtains. One morning I heard a lot of children's voices, calling: "Come, come and look! There is a man sleeping here!" I seldom criticize organizers, maybe because I am one mysel£ That time was a bit over the line, though. Playing seriously in a tournament requires having the chance of a good night's sleep. Food is also important, but everything regarding that subject is very individual. An attitude that doesn't work for some may work well for others. The best method is to use trial and error to find out what works for you. Nevertheless, a few general points can be made. Digestion will take energy from the brain if it has to work too hard, such as if you eat a heavy meal shortly before a game. Sugar is also dangerous; it heightens the level of blood sugar temporarily and gives a lot of energy, but makes it drop even further later on. The only solution to keep the level of blood sugar steady, if you have started to eat sweets, is to continue eating for the whole game! When I started to take chess seriously, I found it natural to stop drinking coffee. Therefore, I was surprised to learn the advice Jesper Hall received when he talked to a nutritionist about chess and food: Eat pasta (long carbohydrates)

1 Y2 hours before you start playing, and drink

coffee (a psychoactive drug) during the game. Nevertheless, everyone has to decide what works for him or her, and I think I do better

366 Pump Up Your Rating

without coffee. One argument is to avoid having a reason to leave the board. Physical preparation Magnus Carlsen blamed having less physical exercise than usual for his bad results in the autumn of 20 10. Physical activity gives surplus energy and helps with focusing. I think it's a good idea to do something every day during a tournament. It doesn't need to take more than 5- 1 0 minutes to go for a short run. When I learned that Hans Tikkanen practised keeping his breath while swimming underwater, I thought it was too odd. When I learned that Bobby Fischer had done the same, I suddenly became more interested! When the inhalation of oxygen stops for some time, the brain has to make more out of less, and expands the capillaries. Coming back to normal circumstances, blood flow is increased. The idea is more or less the same as with altitude training, which many athletes do. Other disturbances My greatest hobby is reading books, which is exactly why I have prohibited myself from reading them during tournaments. It's easy for the mind to get excited, and it may occupy your thoughts during the games. However, there are some books that are easy to stop thinking about, such as those with known endings, like biographies. Personally, earplugs do a great job shutting out all noise during games, and they also remind me that I should be in a competitive mood, focusing as well as possible. Another thing that may disturb you during games is having any valuable belongings - subconsciously some energy is used to worry about them being stolen. As I am quite extreme, I also get disturbed by opponents clicking their pens. Sometimes I bring non clickable pens to hand over to them. However, in this case the problem is better found in me! Anyway, I think it's a good idea not to hesitate in letting opponents or spectators know when they are disturbing you. It's much worse to sit and hope that they will stop by themselves. Lastly, being in love definitely disturbs one's concentration, but I think it's high time I stop before I say something I will regret. .. A final word The chapter has reached its end and it's time for a final conclusion. External factors are very important, at least for those of us who don't find good moves as easily as we see hidden conspiracies. To keep the summary very brief: everything matters. When one game has ended, it's already time to focus on the next game. This book has also come to an end. As I wrote in the introduction, this project feels like the final goal after five years with chess. It has been a real pleasure to write it - reliving all my tough losses, but also some fantastic moments. It is a coincidence that we end with the words "next game", but they fit very well. There will always be a next game. Appendix - Databases Gigabase You need a big database to search for your opponent's games. It's good if it contains annotated games, like ChessBase's MegaBase, but there are also free versions. Every week, it's possible to download new games via TWIC [A] . In addition, it's worthwhile pasting pgn-files from local club events or tournaments; those players will be your most regular opponents. When searching for a specific opponent, it's important to merge the different spellings of his or her name [A] . It is actually a bit tricky with players from some countries, since they mix the first and last names. Reference When studying openings, it's useful to use the flap "Reference" to see played games. To do this, one database has to be marked as a "Reference database" [A] . Since mostly games by strong players are interesting, I recommend creating a smaller database only with games where both players have an Elo of 2450+ (or another limit of your preference). When a new TWIC is downloaded, I search for 2450+ games and copy them to the Reference-database. For sure, many interesting games will be overlooked, but it's not possible to check everything. Another advantage with a small "Reference database" is that it takes a much shorter time to search. For me, with a powerful PC and an analysis engine running at full pace, the difference is between two seconds and more than two minutes {it never finished, as I lost patience). Such delays are mildly irritating, to say the least. My games The most important database is of course the one with your own games, preferably annotated. It's also good to know what information your opponents have. That's not possible to check in the Gigabase, since most opponents hopefully don't have access to pgn-files from local tournaments. Instead, I use the variable "Source" to mark all games in "My games" which are saved in public databases such as "TWIC''. When I want to know which games my opponent can use in his preparation, it's easy to search for the source "TWIC" [A] . Working database It's useful to have a database where on-going work can be saved. In that way, it's easy to remember what you should analyse next. However, the working database also has other purposes. If you have a powerful PC at home and a laptop at tournaments, it might be messy with copies of every file. I think it's easiest to have the original databases at home, and save work done at tournaments in the working database. Another important reason for having a working database is that it becomes easier to send games or analysis to a training partner [A] .

There are also safety reasons. Sometimes, ChessBase replaces the wrong game when saving, thus deleting a game. It is better if that doesn't happen in an opening database. Twice at tournaments my ChessBase program has announced "Program Error" and then deleted everything in the ChessBase bases-folder. When that happened, I was very happy I had everything saved at another location on the laptop. This shows the importance of regularly making backup copies. Opening databases It's impossible to get an overview if all the analysis is saved in a single game. It's useful to split it in a lot of different databases and games. Appendix - ChessBase This is a short appendix, explaining the most important functions. For more information - see the ChessBase manual! Words labelled with * * refer to labels in the ChessBase program. Databases Download games: Visit TWIC at www.theweekinchess.com.

To see games aligned to one source, go to the flap *Sources* and choose one of them. Fix sort order: Put the game in the preferred order, click on *Tools* and *Fix Sort Order*. Appendix - Databases 369 Send games: With an e-mail client, it's possible to mark one or several games, right click and choose *e-mail selected games*. This command is also useful in another way. Now and then ChessBase refuses to save a game, which can be quite annoying. In those situations, it still works to click *File*, *Send*, *Games* and e-mail it to yourself! To send a whole database, all 1 6 ChessBase files (cba, cbc, cbe and so on) have to be transformed into one (cbv). In the main window, mark a database and click on *Tools*, *Database* and *Backup database*. Choose where to save the file, and attach it in an e-mail. Search for games with a specific colour: In the flap *Players*, right click on your opponent and choose *Prepare against White* (if you are Black). Sort by year by clicking on that column header. Create an opening book: Mark all games, and use the command Shift + Enter. Games The engine's number of moves: Click on + or - to increase or decrease the number of shown moves. Split games: It's easiest to copy the game to the "Work database" and copy it back. One variation is kept in the first copy of the game and another in the second. (To see how many half-moves of analysis a game contains, hold the mouse over the column *VCS* on the same line as the game.) Create coloured squares and arrows: Press Alt (green), Alt + Control (Yellow) or Alt + Shift (Red) when right-clicking on a square or right-dragging the mouse between two squares. Enter a null-move: Press Ctrl + Alt + 0. Merge games: Save both games in the same database, mark them and press Enter. The last game is incorporated in the first one. If there are different move orders, they are also merged. It's possible to change the move order in a game. If an opening file starts with l .d4 ltlf6 2.c4 e6 3.ltlf3 d5 4.g3, and should be changed to l .d4 ltlf6 2.c4 e6 3.g3 d5 4.ltlf3, the easiest process is as follows: 1) Create a new game with the correct move order 2) Copy it to the same database as the original game, and place it higher up in the database 3) Merge the games Training: Open a game, click on the flap *Training*. The board is shown, but not the moves. Shortcuts: Some of the most useful shortcuts in ChessBase are Ctrl R (save/replace the game), Ctrl A (open text annotation), Ctrl K (add engine), Ctrl Y (delete variation), Shift = (set evaluation), Shift 1 (set exclamation mark etc.) and Alt j (promote variation).

mistake here! Chapter1 A Very Powerful Piece: The Octopus A knight in the heart of the enemy's position, aiming at both the kingside and the queenside, paralysing the opponent's pieces. Sounds good, doesn't it? Such a knight is sometimes referred to as an octopus, comparing its eight legs to the eight squares that the mighty knight controls. Chess history has seen some famous examples of superb knights on d3 or d6. Think for instance ofRobert Byrne-Fischer, USA-ch 1 96 3 , or Kasparov's impressive victory over Karpov in the 1 6th game of the World Championship match in 1 985. These games can be found annotated in several sources; here we will look into some more recent examples, and consider a few different aspects of the theme. Exchanging the Relevant Bishop First of alllet us see how White may create a home for the octopus: Hrant Melkumyan Evgeny Postny Sarajevo 20 1 2 1 .d4 d 5 2.c4 dxc4 3.tt::l f3 tt::l f6

20.a5. This may surprise you: White

just gives up the octopus for the bad bishop. But what really matters is the material that remains on the board. White has only transformed the charac ter of his advantage. The most famous similar example of this phenomenon is probably Fischer's 22.lt:Jxd7 in Fischer Petrosian, 7th match game, 1 9 7 1 . 1 8. ..

There are vari ous typical means to create an octopus: exchanging the oppo nent's bishop which covers the octopus's entrance square, or tak ing care of the necessary pawn support. When the octopus has been put in position and it is dominating the opponent's pieces especially the rooks - . it will be of magnificent value. With less pieces on the board, the octopus is still a strong piece, but its in fluence is likely to be much less.

Chapter2 A Killer Knight A knight on fS (or f4) versus a casded king often exerts tremendous pressure. Gen erally such a knight must be challenged right away, before it will create strong threats with the support of other pieces. Let's investigate the power of yet another fearsome knight.

Here White's knight is on the edge, while the black bishop, though it's not on the best possible diagonal, just seems normal. Even so, this was one of the rare moments during Tata 20 1 3 when Carlsen was in some trouble. Black has an unpleasant endgame. First of all,White controls the d-flle and also has the better pawn structure. A less no ticeable but important fact is that the knight on aS is better than the bishop on a6. The latter's scope is limited thanks to the white knight, which by contrast has access to some useful squares.

We've seen that a knight on the edge is not a bad thing as long as it is tempo rary and it is en route to a better square (this should not take too long, of course, though in closed positions like in the former example this may be less important) . Here the best square turns out to be c6, and this square is reached by the knight in spectacular fashion. For another entertaining example from the same tournament, see Huschenbeth Valhondo.

Never take on b2 with your queen, even when it is correct. Well, a lot of old and new opening theory tells a different story. And modern engines could not care less. Let's have a look at some daring queens. Good Old Development First a recent 'classic' , showing how it can go wrong. Anish Giri Mateusz Bartel Rhodes 20 1 3 1 .tt:Jf3 d 5 2.d4 a6 3 . .Bg5 c6 4.e3 't!Rb6 5 . .1d3 .i � .t � � 'if � � t, ii, t, Cjj t, t, t, t, t, t, :g: Cjj 'if � :g Giri: 'I have to be frank, penny pincher as I am, I was seriously considering not giving up the pawn, but I was con vinced when I started to calculate how many pieces we would both have devel oped. It was 4-0 to me.' This huge lead in development, as a result of the time that the black queen needs to snatch the b2-pawn, is the classic reason why a capture on b2 is generally condemned. In his inspiring book Sacrifiu and Initia tive, Ivan Sokolov more than once uses the way of evaluating the position Giri uses here, referring to it as 'the attackers versus defenders ratio' . 5 ... 't!Rxb2 6.tt:Jbd2 'iVa3? I guess Bartel did not want to play . . .e7 -e6 before moving his light squared bishop outside the pawn chain, and now also wanted to avoid 6 .. . .1g4 7 .l:tb 1 . However, this takes far too much time and turns out to be overam bitious, enabling Giri to add another chapter to the text-book of examples.

An idea of the late Dutch IM Johan van Mil, whose infectious enthusiasm for the game was extinguished much too soon. I remember using his idea myself in a simul which took place in several shops, as a side event during the Dutch Junior Championships in 2005. As it happened, a young Magnus Carlsen was present in the local bookshop where this game was played. When my oppo nent asked for his verdict on the posi tion, it was clear from the expressi on on Magnus's face that he was not con vinced that the black queen could be successfully caught.

Chapter12 Out of the Box, into the Future Sometimes it requires imaginative prophylactic thinking or concrete calculations to arrive at a counter-intuitive decision. Let's clear our heads and learn from some im pressive examples. Eliminating the Bishop Pair We have had a look at White's elimina tion of the King's Indian bishop on c8 by transferring a knight to a7 (see Chapter 9 'The Deceptive Bishop from c8 ') . There are other, less standard occasions which require out-of-the-box thinking. Here is a recent example where an as tonishing defensive resource eluded such a strong player as Anish Giri.

When immediately after the game Anish asked me where he had gone wrong, I pointed out to him that after 1 6. ti:Jd6 tt:Je8 1 7. tt:Jxc8 followed by the defence of the d-pawn White would have gained equality. Despite the fact that at the present moment the c8-bishop is not a very attractive piece, after Black plays e5 together with the b4-bishop it will become a powerful force.' That may sound simple, but I think for most of us it would be incredibly hard to decide on giving up our strong knight for the undeveloped bishop even if we had recognized its powerful hidden force. 1 6. .. tt:Jxe4 1 7.�xe4 'iit h8 1 8.�g2 K .i.

Apparently this move is an idea of Co mas Fabrego, who described exten sively how it came about in his book True Lies in Chess. He called the text move a 'conceptual novelty' . About this specific position he pointed out that 'it is not clear whether the b6-pawn is weaker than the a4-pawn' and that 'in some variations the b4-square could become an excellent outpost for the black queen' . In a similar position he also noticed that White can no longer avail himself of the standard plan a4-a5 . Black, on the other hand, can still go for a central attack with . . .e6-e5 . Thus there are a number of concrete considerations which may justify Black's permanent weakening of the queenside pawn structure. 1 6.h3 'fie7 Comas Fabrego expected later games to prove the viability of the idea, but few games have since featured 1 5 . . .a5 ! ? (for example, the recent game Leko-Wang Yue, Beijing 20 1 3 , saw 1 5 . . .h6 1 6.a5 ) .

After the text move, the game was eventually drawn as Beliavsky was un able to pose any problems to Black. I must say, I myself found Comas Fabrego's idea baffling. Yet it is doubtful whether we can speak of a conceptual novelty. For example, the following game will not have eluded attentive fol lowers of chess history.

The question is how dangerous the doubled black rooks on the d-file would have been if White hadn't ac cepted the sacrifice.

Improve Your Chess Pattern Recognition Chapter18 Towards the Edge On many occasions there are good reasons to take not towards the centre with a pawn, but towards the edge. lbis isn't exceptional - it's quite common practice. However, when there is a choice the general rule remains to capture towards the centre. Opening the f-File In this article we'll mainly look at the f-pawn, although of course other pawns also come into consideration. For exam ple, a regular capture towards the edge that springs to mind is ...d7xc6 in vari ous variations of the Ruy Lopez. In that case Black considers his pawn structure and piece development to be more im portant than having a central pawn.

Immediately increasing the scope of the fi -rook. As we've seen before, an im- 1 26 portant benefit of doubled pawns can be a new open file.

1 1 .fxg31 There are no doubled pawns here, but this capture creates more pawn islands. On the other hand, it not only opens the f-file, but also renders Black's open h-file less significant. Black's plan could be to exchange the light-squared bishops and direct his queen to the h-file. With a pawn on h2 , which can easily be protected from f2 , this plan will likely be lesssuccessful than with the pawn on f2 instead. This is common knowledge in the Dragon.

Of course White isn't going to ex change queens. He will try to arrange his pieces on the long and open a l -h8 diagonal and set up an attack against the black king. Black's bishop, in contrast, doesn't inspire awe on the light squares, merely looking at its own pawn on e4.

They do, however, create a half-open file. In our first example the half-open g-file (yes, the same file that can be opened by doubling the f-pawns!) facilitates an at tack on the king.

However, for those familiar with either this Nimzo line or the famous Griinfeld game Sakaev-Belov, the move won't come as a surprise. Also check out Miedema-Swinkels, which saw the in verted version, when Black tried to drive the knight on d4 away with . . .e6-e5 , which was naturally ignored (f4-f5 !) . But there's even more to the game posi tion: by bravely avoiding a move repeti tion Black has reached the exact posi tion of the famous game Anand-Wang Hao, Wijk aan Zee 2 0 1 1 (though strangely enough my ChessBase search options won't do the trick! ?) . This game revived interest in the knight sac, of which Timman says in an inter esting article devoted to the subject in New In Chess 20 1 1 /2 : 'As a rule you can say this knight sacrifice is onl)- suc cessful if Black's position leaYes some thing to be desired.' This is of course a rather general statement, which resem bles what Willy Hendriks ridicules as Chapter 2 7 - Central Avalanches 'free advice' in his book Move First, Think Later. Of course it is hard to pro vide general guidelines about when to execute this sac. So just remember the pattern and assess the possibility when it comes along!

Romanovsky talks about the obscurity, the diffi culty and the riski ness of the sacrifice, and Kasparov calls it an uncommonly bold and pretty sacri fice. Valery Beim, on the other hand, says this about the next move: 'striking, al though this sacrifice is a quite routine idea, but here its correctness is question able at first, second and third glance! ' So where lies the truth? The idea is not unknown - it appears in Anderssen Morphy, I 85 8 , for one! Calling it a rou tine idea in I 95 5 with such a tense fol low-up as in the game seems a bit strong. This is what Bronstein himself said: 'the unexpected sacrifice of a bishop promises a very strong attack. After I 5 .'if d2 the white attack unfolds by itself' (The Sorcerer's Apprentice)

a71? Once again, opting for long-term de velopment along the 7th rank despite both the pawn on b7 and the knight on d7 being still in the way. When we make a comparison to the more common rook lift along the third rank, one difference may be that the second-rank development often in volves slow positional strategy behind the pawns. Along the third rank the rook is likely to create more instant ac tivity in front of its own pawns. In general, rooks seem to cooperate more harmoniously when they are not on the same rank. When they are dou bled on the same (open) file, their co operation, as you will know, can be very fruitful, for instance when trying to in vade the enemy position.

As Emms noted, there are several theo retical lines which feature the avoidance of an exchange of a superfluous knight, such as the Closed Sicilian or the Chigorin Ruy Lopez.

He mentioned the Dutch Stonewall. Here we have an example of that struc ture featuring some familiar elements. 1 2.tt:Jb1 !? Of course, here too Black was intending to exchange the foremost knight, be fore occupying e4 with the other one. Again, with all four minor pieces on the board Black suffers some spatial prob lems; as seen previously, White may fol low up with tLleS and f2-f3 . The draw back is that the knight on b I will be temporarily inactive (and in other cases this drawback may just turn out to be too serious!) , but here it may even assist the defence.

The pawn structure brought about a typ ical fight between Black's advanced pawn on the queenside versus White's pawn av alanche on the kingside. Viswanatha.n Anand Magnus Carlsen Chennai 20 1 3 i i i ' � � � � � � � Cfj !1: � � � 'iV !1: � Clearly a battle is in progress on oppo site sides of the board. Here White will try to use his space advantage on the kingside and his central pawn majority to set up a kingside attack. Black will try to create a passed pawn out of his queenside majority. The latter plan seems obvious: prepar ing and then executing . . .bS-b4 will do the trick (in fact, Carlsen had just played . . .a7-a5). For White's attack we need more moves and imagination. Yet GM Erwin 1' Ami tweeted: 'Think today we see one of those few positions where the computer doesn't have a clue. I'd blindly take White.' And indeed it is al- ways attractive to mount a mating at tack which could immediately decide the game. On the other hand, whenever a passed pawn is created, promotion may still be far off. By the way, Erwin's remark about the computer is also interesting. suggesting that engines are not capable of making correct long-term assessments (or at least need considerably more time to do so) . So never rely solely on your en gines - feed them with your own ideas, and fmd out the hard way! 1 5.g5 tt::l e8 1 6.e4 tt::l xc1 Anand had just created space for his bishop to develop and Carlsen decided to swap it off, not wanting to be stuck with an out-of-play knight on b3 . In this regard you might want to look back at Zhao Xue-Harika Dronavalli, 20 1 2 , the first example in Chapter 3 7 on offside pieces. A move such as 1 6. .. tt::l c7 could still be considered as the queenside is likely to be opened up, after which the knight on b3 may be not that bad at all. After 1 7 . �e3 l:ta6 1 8 .eS b4 the situation is similar to the game, except White is one tempo slower, but his dark-squared bishop is still on the board. Again he Chapter 40 - The Runner and the Bulldozer will have to proceed with f3-f4-f5 , now or after exchanges on b4 and a6. 1 7.'ifxc1 .Ua6 1 8.e5 It is all about speed: who will be the first to have serious threats? One of the most difficult questions is deciding when to follow your own plan and when to hinder the opponent's plans. In this respect it is worth mentioning that Kasparov let the world know (via Twit ter, of course) that he would prefer 1 8 . .Ub2 . 1 8. .. tbc7 And here, on the same topic, Carlsen was considering 1 8 . .. g6 1 9. f4 tbg7 and now an exchange sacrifice after f4-f5 doesn't seem convincing, but Carlsen feared 'ifb 1 . In general, up to now, Black had avoided pawn moves on the kingside, which could speed up White's attack. If Black could really achieve a blockade on fS , it would be a different matter! 1 9.f4 b4 20.axb4 A lot will be written about the alterna tives 20.f5 lbbS and 20.a4, but Anand's idea of exchanging a defender (the :a6) will strike you as logical. 20 ... axb4 21 . .Uxa6 -Lxa6 22.f5 b3 Perhaps the climax of the st:raregic bar tie: the problem for Whire is th.ar his only remaining rook has to stay on the defensive to stop Black's passed b-pawn. Anand's aberration a couple of moves further on has already been discussed extensively in the media.

And indeed it was this game which Giri referred to in a somewhat puzzling tweet: 'Magnus with his great memory no doubt re members Botvinnik-Capablanca 1 -0 :) Let's see if he can make use ofit! ' (The fact is that the then up and coming Botvinnik had about the same age dif ference with Capa as Carlsen with Anand, though with colours re versed.) But no. Had the bishop been on b2 in the dia gram position, then you would have been completely right! This position, however, stems from Botvinnik-Alexan der, Radio match 1 946 (no need for the internet in those days!) . And, as a mat ter of fact, Botvinnik had deviated from his previous classic by playing the same early a2-a4 and .Ba3 as in the former game.

A silent sacrifice that remarkably took absolute world top player Aronian by surprise. It allows Black to fight for the b-file. 31 .i.xb4 After the game Aronian admitted he had missed 3 0. . J:tb4 and that 'Taking on b4 was completely ridiculous' . This should be a clear assessment of White's last move, which is of course not bad in the sense that it loses immediately.

. . . White was soon successful on the other wing. Books are also a good source of inspira tion and material. Reading in Judit Polgar's excellent second autobiograph ical book (From GM to Top Ten) I en countered yet another type of exchange sac, a 'silent one'. Not in the actual game though, but in her considerations during the game: Here 1 9.tLla4!? was played. Polgar adds the following comment: 'I felt that oc cupying the b6-square was more im portant than material. I also considered Epilogue 1 9. l:!.fb 1 ! ? followed by l:!.b6 sacrificing an exchange with similar ideas.' Indeed a familiar type of sacrifice which is also dealt with in this book. However, this time it wasn't actually played. Which again goes to show that recognizing a pattern does not always equal the only or correct solution. In the same book (Chapter 4) Polgar deals with 'Positional Sacrifices' , which is of course a much broader term than the patterns in this book. Yet, when compar ing two of her games against Karpov she draws some interesting and very specific parallels. Both games contain a knight sacrifice on the same square (dS) and yield a strong pawn centre for the sacri ficed material. In fact, in particular the game from Buenos Aires 2000 would have neatly fitted in this book's 2 7th chapter, on Central Avalanches. I am sure that if you carefully read other chess writers, you will also detect such fragments which are closely connected to pattern recognition. The number of patterns is by no means exhausted with the publication of this book. For the selection I have had to drop many, and meanwhile I keep run ning into other 'fresh' ones. Take this position from Maletin-Khismatullin, Izhevsk 20 1 4:

His youth in the chess-minded city of Apeldoorn brought him second place in the national youth championships under 1 6. Later (in 2003) he became an International Master, before shifting his attention to training. For several years Van de Oudeweetering has trained the Dutch federation's youth selection under 1 4 (today some of these selected players have become strong grandmasters) . He certainly benefited from his acquired experience with compil ing training material when he started to write a weekly column on the middlegame for the ChessVibes Training magazine, which eventually laid the foundation for this book. More recently Van de Oudeweetering has been writing a monthly column for Chess.com's Master's Bulletin. 3 0 1

Since that time, I've received hun- dreds of requests for more on this same theme (i.e., the art of thinking in chess). This led to The Amateur's Mind, a very personal look into a player's head and thinking habits. The flow of mail didn't stop, though, and requests for a third volume arrived in even greater numbers than before. It was clear that many players liked the thinking technique I expounded, rallying around my system because it allowed them to understand various chess subtleties in a way that was easy and made sense. In fact, many students of the game felt they had mas- tered the "system," though a talk with them quickly demonstrated that this wasn't the case. This realiza- tion showed me what had to be done: I needed to write a book that would enable a player to test him- self and see how much he really understood about planning. This book is divided into three parts. Part One: A Look at a System, explores my method of chess thought. In Thinking Techniques, I start with a discus- sion of modern thinking techniques describing a few attempts by well-known chess thinkers to clarify how chess positions should be looked at and how indi- vidual moves should be found. My own system of thinking is then compared to those previously dis- cussed.

X / THE REASSESS YOUR CHESS WORKBOOK

In Imbalances: a Crash Course, I discuss the seven inbalances that form the basis of my system. Each of these imbalances are explained in detail, and examples are given that teach the student how to use them to their advantage as well as how to play against them. In fact, this part of the book is the key to solving the prob- lems that follow. All the problems in this book are designed to see how well you can form a plan and recognize the imbalances in each phase of the game. Part Two is composed of 131 positional/strategic and tactical problems from the opening, the middlegame, and the endgame, plus a section on self-annotations. Though the problems are pre- sented in these four basic ways, I purposely avoided any continu- ity of theme or idea. As in real play, it's up to you to find and understand these things without help from an invisible voice ("White to mate in two" appears in books, but we often miss the mate in real play because nobody is giving us this enormous clue). I've also designed the problems to have a huge range of difficulty, usually from 1200 to the much higher 2100 level. In fact, some of the tests will be challenging to players with ratings of 2500 and up! Even if you are unfamiliar with the material from my previous books, the solutions to the problems, given in Part Three, are laid out in such depth that the positions in question will be filled with new and exciting meaning. Fresh ways of looking at the game will be served to you on a platter, and your knowledge of chess as a whole should go through a major revolution. The Reassess Your Chess Workbook can be used as a serious testing device or as a straightforward book of instruction: ♦ You can make a serious effort to solve all the prob- lems. An excellent way to do this is to place your answers (given in as much detail as you can man- age) in a notebook. Only look at the solutions when you've gone through all the questions. This will allow you to form an honest idea of how knowl- edgeable you really are. (Many players feel they already know this material. This is your chance to see if you are wise or deluded!)

studying The Reassess Your Chess Workbook should prove very rewarding.

4 You can look at a problem, try to solve it, and then

immediately look at the answer. ♦ Instead of trying to solve the problems, you can skip that section of the book, jump to the solutions, and simply study what's given. In this way, you will be using the book in a purely instructional manner. This book fills a void in chess literature. Most problem books tend to ask lots of questions, but give pathetically sparse answers- they don't really teach you anything at all. It is my hope that The Reassess Your Chess Workbook will prove to be both entertaining and highly instructive, and the student should garner many hours of pleasure from it. As always, I welcome readers with corrections, observations, or comments to email me at jsilman@earthlink.net. excellent move. brilliant move. interesting move. dubious move. poor move. blunder. Tdiirty years ago, the English translation (from the original Russian) of a now classic book appeared that offered a detailed discussion on how to improve your powers of analysis. This book, Think Like a Grand- master? by Alexander Kotov, strove to show the seri- ous student how to become a fast and accurate calcu- lator. In his introduction, Mr. Kotov gave the follow- ing qualities as being the building blocks that form a "real" chess player: 1) He must be well up in modern opening theory.

2.) He must know and keep in his memory

the principles behind typical middlegame positions learned both from his own games, and from those of other players. The more a player knows and remembers the easier it is for him to find a 'precedent', i.e., a position which has occurred before and which is similar to his own present position. 3) A grandmaster must be able to assess a position accurately and correctly. 4) No less important is the ability to hit upon the right plan-a plan that meets the demands of the given position. 5) A grandmaster must be able to calculate accurately and quickly those variations which might arise in the subsequent course of play.

Inc., 1971).

Later in the book, Kotov goes on to discuss his method of calculation: (The following wording is mine. I hope I've cap- tured Kotov's true meaning!) List the candidate moves (i.e., all the moves you are seriously considering) and then analyze each one thoroughly to the end, without jumping back and forth between them. For example, if you are looking at three pos- sible moves G6.Rg6, 36.Qg6 and 36.Ne5), you would first take a deep look at 36.Rg6 until you were sure you had figured out its "truth." Next on the agenda would be another deep analysis, this time of 36.Qg6. At this point, even if you decide that 36.Qg6 is a great move, you must still follow the same detailed proce- dure with your final candidate move, 36.Ne5. Once you have analyzed them all, then and only then is it time to decide which move to actually play (and, at times, that decision may turn out to be a matter of taste). Kotov makes a compelling point when he says that, though some players have an innate talent for speedy calculation, most have to work very hard to improve in this area. Unfortunately, he's right! The vast majority of chess hopefuls will indeed have to invest hours and hours of intense labor if they want to calculate at a high level. I have no argument with Kotov's views. However, after I read his book and thought about what he had said, I became worried about one extremely important question: How is the poor chess player supposed to figure out the correct candidate moves? Kotov likes telling us what to do once we know what the candidate moves are in a given position, but he doesn't bother telling us how to find those candidates in the first place! His comment is not too helpful: "How then does a chessplayer choose which move to play in a given position? There is no easy answer; each player goes about choosing in his own way." Gee thanks, Alexander, that's useful! A later comment by Kotov did nothing to illuminate the darkness: "How many candidate moves then does a grandmaster examine? As must be clear, there is no standard answer to this question; in each position he exam- ines as many as seem necessary in the given circumstances." Ultimately, Kotov's advice comes up short for most players, simply because they will never be able to calculate like a grand-

master, nor do they have any real expectations of doing so. Nev- ertheless, wouldn't these same people still be able to play a ven' strong game of chess if they could find a proper plan and come up with a logical series of candidate moves to actualize it? I was positive this was the case, but how could an Expert, Class A (1800- 1999) or even a Class B (1600-1799), C (1400-1599), or D (1200- 1399) find these hidden plans and candidates? Before looking at my attempt to solve this problem, let's see how other chess thinkers tackled the concept of planning. Grand- master John Nunn, one of the world's most respected chess writ- ers, is the first on our list. The following planning tips come from his excellent book, Secrets of Practical Chess.2 There comes a point in the vast majority of games when your acquired knowledge will be exhausted and you will have to rely on your own resources. This point normally arises in the early middlegame. The next step is to formulate a plan. Cutting to the chase (and skipping a few sentences), Nunn then goes on to say: In some positions, for example, those with a blocked center, it may be appropriate to construct a long-term plan which may require ten or twenty moves to execute. More likely, your plan will be much shorter-range, lasting perhaps five moves. This applies particularly in relatively open positions. Nunn offers the student the following three steps: 1) Make sure your plan is beneficial. There is no point aiming for a target that does not actually enhance your position. Typical misguided plans are: attacking on the wrong part of the board; aiming for the exchange of the wrong pieces; committing yourself to weakening pawn advances. 2) Make sure your plan is realistic. There is no point in embarking on a five-move plan if your opponent can wait for the first four moves, and then stop your plan by playing one move himself. 3) Make sure your plan is not tactically flawed. Even if what you are aiming for is worthwhile, this will not help if your opponent can mate you while you are executing it. 2John Nunn, Secrets of Practical Chess (London: Gambit Publications LTD, 1998).

6 / THE REASSESS YOUR CHESS WORKBOOK

Nunn later points out that you should be ready to change your plan or, at the very least, make adjustments to it: If your opponent has blocked Plan A, but at the cost of creat- ing a weakness elsewhere on the board, it would be foolish to stick to your original intention, ignoring the new situation. Most games are like this: the players formulate a series of mini-plans and strike a balance between forwarding their own plans and interfering with those of the opponent. The good doctor gives useful advice, but it really doesn't an- swer my earlier question about finding that hidden plan and its candidate moves. In other words, he assumes a fairly high degree of chess skill from the reader of his book, and much of what he says is over the head of Class C and B players. Having failed to find enlightenment from world class grand- masters (they just don't share the pain of us guys in the trenches!), let's see if a "normal" grandmaster might prove to be more help- ful. American-born Jonathan Tisdall, who now resides in Norway, wrote an incredibly good book called Improve Your Chess Now . 3 Let's take a peek at a small bit of what he had to say on our subject: • Talk to yourself - not out loud, of course! - that's against the rules, and chess players have a shaky enough reputation already. • Try to determine your next move by examining one principal variation. This variation may either be the one that first or most strongly appeals, or which you feel seems to fit the strategic demands of the position. • Process the concrete variations calculated, into themes and positional factors and use them to deter- mine what moves are likely to be relevant. Use the information gathered on your calculation, and try to render it in verbal form that makes it useful for further searches. Describe your findings. • If your primary variation is unsatisfactory, calm down, lean back, and make a thorough list of possible candidates with fresh eyes. • The times for a conscious listing of candidate moves are quite logical: when one pauses naturally due to an obvious wealth of alternatives, or when one's preliminary calculations have not achieved the desired result. 3Jonathan Tisdall, Improve Your Chess Now (London: Cadogan, 1997).

THINKING TECHNIQUES / 7

In sharp, tactical positions it is extremely important to make a comprehensive list at these times. • Have faith in your calculations. You may be wrong, but you have only yourself to trust. If you are often wrong, it just means that you need to improve this ability, but when you use it, you must trust it. • In predominantly strategic games, the search process is similar, but the calculation of concrete variations will be less important than the internal discussion of positional elements. All this is very interesting, but it's still over the head of a average class player. It seems that we have to move even further down the food chain in an attempt to find a writer who actually remembers what it's like to be confused about things that most masters take for granted. Our next "guest speaker" was pondering our question about plans and candidate moves way back in the 1930's, long before I was born! Cecil Purdy (winner of the World Championship of Correspondence Chess in 1953) was an Australian player and teacher who created one of the most detailed systems for finding a plan ever devised. Written mainly for amateurs, his work was forgotten (or ignored) by players in this part of the world until his writings were collected in The Search For Chess Perfection: The Life, Games, and Writings of CJ.S. Purdy? Even I wasn't aware of the scope of Purdy's work until a few students of mine demanded that I take a look at the aforemen- tioned book. After spending a couple of hours with it, I had to agree that Purdy was that very rare author who understood the suffering of the typical amateur. Having noticed their disease, Purdy then devised a "cure" in simple, easy to understand language. The following is Purdy's recommended thinking technique. It's been cut and reshaped by me (his actual format and language is, at times, rather ponderous) for clarification (my comments ap- pear in bold), so if you wish to see the original, buy the book!

I. MY TURN TO MOVE.

1. What are all the moves I have to consider?

Purdy points out that this question may be unanswer- able at this stage, but will become clear after ques-

1 CJ.S. Purdy, The Search for Chess Perfection: The Life, Games, and Writings of

CJ.S. Purdy (Davenport: Thinkers' Press, Inc., 1997)-

tion five. So why ask this question so quickly? Be- cause, in some cases, there may be only one or two obvious possibilities and you can then save time by ignoring the rest of the system.

2. How has his last move changed the position? What are his

threats? What are his objectives? Always keep the position "up to date" by demanding to know how, and to what extent, your opponent's move has changed things. It is vital to be aware of any threats' When you see a threat, your first reaction should not be to search for a defense to it but rather for a way of ignoring it.

3. Complete your search if not already done

a. Material Notice such things as two Bishops, Bishops of opposite colors, pawn majorities, etc.; b. King positions. Is one of the Kings exposed? Always note if there is a lack of flight squares; c. Weaknesses and strengths. Weak pawns, weak squares, confined pieces, lack of space, d. Development. Purdy considers the value of a tempo to be a quarter to a third of a center pawn, and up to half a flank pawn; e. Where could either side break through? After l.e4 e6

2.d4 d5 3*e5, White's breakthrough point is f5, while

Black's are on c5 and f6.

4. Have I a good combination? To help in this, look for possible

combination motifs. a. geometrical; b. nets; c. jump moves; d. zugzwang (applies only to an endgame); e. stalemate (applies only to an endgame).

5. If not satisfied that the answer to 4 is yes, what is my best plan

(for this, use the reconnaissance)? How can I best exploit his weaknesses, establish my strengths, eliminate my weaknesses and reduce his strengths. Now, when you consider the first question, What are all the moves I have to consider? again, the answer should be far easier to discover.

THINKING TECHNIQUES / U

II. I AM CONSIDERING A CERTAIN MOVE-

1. Visualize the move as though made, firmly

2. Does it leave me vulnerable to any combination?

III. IT IS HIS TURN TO MOVE,

1. Make a reconnaissance, as described in I, to be completed

when he has made his move.

2. Visualize the position after this or that likely move, and pro-

ceed as in I. I was shocked to see how similar Purdy's recommendations were to my own! His "When you see a threat, your first reaction should not be to search for a defense to it but rather for a way of ignoring it" is a particular rave of mine with students. I'm always telling them to try their best to ignore enemy threats by making sure that a "threat" is real and not imagined. I see so many games where a player "threatens" something and his opponent (usually a student of mine) weakens his position to stop it. Closer exami- nation, though, shows that the so-called threat would have failed completely. In other words, my student went out of his way to stop his opponent from losing the game! As I just mentioned, my own thinking technique (given in great detail in my books, How to Reassess Your Chess 5 and The Amateur's Mind6 ) is similar to Purdy's in many ways, though I like to think of mine as being more concise and to the point. In particular, my concept of IMBALANCES considerably simplifies the work an amateur has to do. What is an imbalance? An imbal- ance is any difference between the White and Black positions. My system of thought, quite simply, calls for the student to:

4 Take note of the differences in the position (i.e., all

the imbalances that exist, not being partial to one side or the other). ♦ Figure out the side of the board you wish to play on (queenside, center, or kingside). You can only play where a favorable imbalance or the possibility of creating a favorable imbalance exists. 5Jeremy Silman, How to Reassess Your Chess.The Complete Chess Mastery Course, Expanded 3rd Edition (Los Angeles: Slles Press, 1993). 6Jeremy Silman, The Amateur's Mind: Turning Chess Misconceptions into Chess Mastery ( Los Angeles: Siles Press, 1999).

10 / THE REASSESS YOUR CHESS WORKBOOK

♦ Find all the candidate moves (back to Kotov!) that allow your side to make use of a major imbalance, or a series of imbalances. This improves on Kotov, who didn't tell us bow to find candidate moves. A candi- date move should always be directed at your positive imbalances unless you're being forced to play a purely defensive move. ♦ Finally, calculate the candidate moves you've chosen. I've long held that a player can be guided to the correct move by simply listing the imbalances for both sides-of course, a basic understanding of how to use these imbalances must also exist. Once he "hears" the language of these imbalances (first noting what imbalances exist and then trying and find a way to nurture them), the correct move, or, at the very least, a few logical candi- dates, will virtually jump out and bite him on the nose! For example, let's say you are playing a game and note that your opponent's position is not top threatening and that he has a weak pawn on b6. You also see that the b- and g-files are half open and that all other files are closed. Two things are of great importance here: ♦ your opponent has a weakness on b6. ♦ Rooks belong on open or half-open files. So what kind of moves should you look for? What would the candidate moves be? Clearly, you must get your Rooks into the battle, and you must also try and generate pressure against your opponent's weakness on b6. Thus, the only moves you would address should have some- thing to do with these key points. Though we are playing with- out a position in mind, I would say that you'd almost certainly want to double Rooks on the b-file (the g-file has nothing to do with the weakness on b6), because that mixes both plusses at the same time (playing on a file and attacking b6). In other words, any candidate move would have to begin this doubling operation. Note that this imaginary position allowed us to make easy use of the four points listed on the previous page: we listed the imbal-

THINKING TECHNIQUES / 11

ances; we decided to play on the side of the board where our favorable imbalances resided; we were able to find the proper candidate moves (moves designed to make use of the imbalances); we were only ready to calculate after we verbalized the positions possibilities. Now that I've demonstrated how simple this method of thought is, it's time to gain a deeper understanding of the vari- ous imbalances.

1 In IMBALANCE in chess denotes any difference

in two respective positions. Of course, most players don't think about imbalances, they prefer to concen- trate on attacking the enemy King. However, to think that the game of chess is solely devoted to check- mating the opposing King is much too simplistic. The correct way to play chess is to create an imbalance and try to build a situation in which it is favorable for you. An actual checkmate will follow once your opponent is helpless, or if the imbalances insist that an early kingside attack is the correct course. A deeper understanding of this statement shows that an imbalance is not necessarily an advantage. It is simply a difference. It is the player's responsibility to turn that difference into an advantage. A study of this chapter should enable you to im- mediately make the most of each imbalance you cre- ate, as well as allow you to look at the upcoming problems in a way that might not have been possible before digesting this information. List of Imbalances > Superior Minor Piece - the interplay between Bishops and Knights (trying to make one superior to the other). > Pawn Structure - a broad subject that encompasses doubled pawns, isolated pawns, backward pawns, passed pawns, etc.

14 / THE REASSESS YOUR CHESS WORKBOOK

> Space - the annexation of territory on a chessboard. > Material - owning pieces of greater value than the opponent's. > Control of a key file or square - files, ranks, and diagonals act as pathways for your pieces, while squares act as homes. Whole plans can center around the domination of a file, or the creation of a weak square in the enemy camp. > Development - a lead in development gives you more force in a specific area of the board. This is a temporary imbalance because the opponent will eventually catch up. > Initiative - dictating the tempo of a game. This can also turn out to be a temporary imbalance. If one side owns a Bishop while the other has a Knight, that's an important imbalance. If one side has the superior pawn struc- ture while the opponent owns more space, then that, too, is an imbalance. You must always try and make your imbalance beat the opponent's! Whole plans can and should be created around this idea. In fact, these plans can often be found with little or no calculation.

IMBALANCES: A CRASH COURSE / 15

Can you list the imbalances? If you noticed the weakened d5- square, the backward d6-pawn, and the fact that White owns a Knight while Black has a Bishop, you did really well! How can you make use of these imbalances? What move addresses these factors? Let's consider the following bits of chess wisdom: > A Knight needs an advanced, permanent home if it wants to prove itself superior to an enemy Bishop. > A weak square tends to make an excellent home for your pieces! > A backward pawn can't always be attacked immedi- ately. However, it's important to fix it in place so that it becomes an immobile target (it's easy to hit things that can't run away!). With this information in mind, we should be able to surmise that White would like to improve the position of his Knight in order to make it better than Black's Bishop. How would you do this? l.Nb5 pushes the Knight forward, but is b5 a permanent home? No, it's not. Black can move his Queen to safety and then kick White's Knight off b5 with ...a7-a6. The dream square for the White Knight is actually d5. Once it sits there, nothing can chase it away! How can the Knight reach that square (all this internal talk brings to mind Tisdall's recom- mendation that we should learn to talk to ourselves during play)? Once you see that the goal is domination and occupation of d5, there is really only one candidate move that makes sense: l.Nc2 when either 2.Nb4 and 2,Ne3 (both take you to d5) followed by

3.Nd5 allows White to fulfill all his imbalance-oriented dreams:

The Knight dominates the Bishop, White owns the d5-square, and the d6-pawn isn't going anywhere (all this was done with no calculation!). Now that you realize how helpful an understanding of the imbalances can be, it's time to address the particulars of each situation.

16 / THE REASSESS YOUR CHESS WORKBOOK

Superior Minor Pieces The battle between Bishops and Knights is one of the most subtle and important in chess. A good player will invariably end up with a powerful Knight over a poor Bishop (or a powerful Bishop over a poor Knight) against his lower-rated opponent. Then, when he plays someone stronger than himself, he will find that the situation is reversed and his minor piece is inferior to whatever his opponent owns. You will discover that this "food chain" lacks any kind of mercy; only a deep understanding of the needs of both the Bishop and the Knight will allow you to keep your head above water in this turbulent fight. If you are already familiar with this information (as many of you will be), skip this chapter and jump right into chapter two. The Bishop There are three basic types of Bishop: > Good - A Bishop is considered good when its central pawns are not on its color and thus are not obstructing its activity. > Bad - A Bishop is considered bad when its central pawns are on its color and thus block it. > Active - An active Bishop can be either good or bad; it's called active simply because it serves an active function. Personally, I can't stand the "good" and "bad" labels. Insisting that your Bishop serves some kind of active function is all you really need to do. White's Bishop is good, Black's is bad.

IMBALANCES; A CRASH COURSE / 17

(3) Two "bad" Bishops, but White's is very active. In diagram (2) White has a good Bishop that also happens to be very active. Black's, on the other hand, is bad and also com- pletely inactive. Our next diagram (3) shows two bad Bishops. However. White's is so active that it virtually dominates the game. Bishop Rule 1 - Bishops are long-range pieces and love wide-open positions that are free of central pawns. Bishop Rule 2 - In the endgame, Bishops are great at stopping enemy pawns, which they can often do from the other side of the board. (4) The Bishop stops all the enemy pawns from a distance. In diagram (4) the Bishop's long-range ability crushes the enemy Knight.

15 / THE REASSESS YOUR CHESS WORKBOOK

Bishop Rule 3 - If you are unfortunate enough to possess a bad (and inactive) Bishop, you are usually well advised to do one of three things: > Trade the offending piece off for an enemy Bishop or Knight. > Make it good by moving the central pawns off the color of your Bishop. > Get your Bishop outside the pawn chain. Many games have been won by turning an impotent bad Bishop into a "bad" but active piece. (5) White to play will trade off his horrible Bishop by l.Ba4. In diagram (5) White's Bishop is clearly inferior to Black's. Because of this, trading it off by l.Ba4 makes good sense. (6) Bring White's Bishop back to life. In diagram (6) White's Bishop again seems to be a loser. How- ever, by l.g3 followed by 2.Bh3 (l...Qd7 2,Kh2 still gets the Bishop

IMBALANCES: A CRASH COURSE / 19

to the golden square) the calcified piece suddenly finds a new lease on life. Bishop Rule 4 - If a player gets the two Bishops versus a Bishop and Knight or Two Knights, he usually wants to retain them because, working together, the Bishops control squares of both colors. If your opponent has two Bishops, trade one of them off and leave yourself with a more manageable Knight versus Bishop or Bishop versus Bishop scenario. The Knight Knights are the only pieces that have the ability to jump over other men. This makes them very effective in closed positions, but vulnerable to Bishops in situations with no support points and wide-open diagonals (Steinitz said that the best way to beat Knights was to take away all their advanced support points). Knight Rule 1 - Knights need advanced support points if they are going to compete successfully with Bishops. A support point (i.e., an advanced square that can't be controlled by an enemy pawn) on the sixth rank is ideal, while a Knight on the fifth is usually better than a Bishop. A Knight on the fourth is a very strong piece, but we see a case of diminishing returns if you place it on the third, second, or first ranks. The first and second ranks in particular are not good homes for a Knight and should only be used as a path to greener pastures.

20 / THE REASSESS YOUR CHESS WORKBOOK

(7) The horse dominates the game from its sixth-rank perch. Knight Rule 2 - Knights tend to be superior to Bishops in closed positions. A wall of pawns will completely shut a Bishop down, but a Knight will just jump over this wall and continue on its way. (8) The nimble Knight is king of closed positions. White's Knight, in diagram (8), is flexible and happy. It will dominate the game after Nd3-f2-e4 where it eyes the d6-pawn, blocks Black's passed e-pawn, helps White's kingside majority advance, and also envisions possibilities like Ne4-g5-e6. Knight Rule 3 - Knights are the best blockaders of passed pawns. A Knight can stop an enemy passer in its tracks and still remain active due to its ability to jump over other units.

IMBALANCES: A CRASH COURSE / 21

(9) Both sides' minor pieces are blocking enemy passed pawns. In diagram (9), White's Bishop is blocking Black's passed pawn but it has virtually no activity or scope. On the other hand, Black's Knight is not only blocking White's passed pawn, it is also attacking the enemy pawns on e4 and c4. After l.Bc2 (de- fending e4) l...Qf4, Black's Queen will penetrate into the enemy position and cause White all sorts of trouble. Knight Rule 4 - Knights are usually superior to Bishops in endings with pawns on only one side of the board. Such a position makes light of a Bishop's long-range powers, while the Knight's ability to go to either color (a Bishop is forever stuck on one color complex) becomes extremely valuable. Pawn Structure In the 1700s, Andre Philidor said, "Pawns are the soul of chess." This simple statement tells us that a particular pawn structure dictates what plan(s) to adopt, when to seek an endgame, and when to realize that a position has some sort of static inferiority. Since pawn chains ("Always attack a pawn chain at its base.") and my "pawn pointing theory" will be studied within the con- fines of the problems, I will only present the basics of doubled pawns, isolated pawns, backward pawns, and passed pawns here. Doubled Pawns Though despised by most players, doubled pawns are not all bad, and can often be an actual advantage.

22 / THE REASSESS YOUR CHESS WORKBOOK

Doubled Pawns Rule 1 - A doubled pawn gives its owner an extra open file for his Rooks. Doubled Pawns Rule 2 - If the pawns are central, double pawns allow for coverage of critical squares that would not be possible if the pawns were undoubled and "healthy." (10) Useful doubled pawns. In diagram (10) White's doubled pawns give him control over d5, f5, d4, and f4. The half-open f-file is another perk that this structure offers. Doubled Pawns Rule 3 - Doubled pawns can turn out to be inflexible and, in the worst case scenario, simply weak. In general, the lead pawn turns out to be the target

(ID

White's c4-pawn is vulnerable to attack. In diagram (11) White's c3-pawn can't be reached by enough Black pieces to cause it any concern. However, the c4-pawn is

IMBALANCES: A CRASH COURSE / 23

within range of the Black army, and it will feel a lot of heat after Black plays ...Nb8-c6-a5 followed by ...Ba6. Isolated Pawns An isolated pawn results when no other "friendly" pawn is on an adjacent file. This lonely guy can't be touched or defended by any of his brothers and, as a result, he becomes vulnerable to attack by enemy pieces. Most players feel that an isolated pawn is always a weakness. However, nothing could be further from the truth! Isolated Pawn Rule 1 - An isolated pawn might be an unstoppable passer. Isolated Pawn Rule 2 - It might be centrally placed, which means that it may guard important squares. Isolated Pawn Rule 3 - You might be able to use an isolated pawn as a battering ram that will slam into, and subsequently fragment, the enemy's "superior" structure. Isolated Pawn Rule 4 - Even if your isolated pawn isn't going anywhere, your Rooks might become more active than the opponent's thanks to the two half, or fully, open files on either side of it. The isolated d-pawn gives White control over the c5- and e5- squares.

24 / THE REASSESS YOUR CHESS WORKBOOK

(13) The isolated a-pawn acts as a battering ram. Black to move. In diagram (13) Black plays l...a4, gets rid of his isolated battering ram and, after making a pawn trade via ..axb3, turns White's "healthy" queenside majority into a weak isolated pawn. Isolated Pawn Rule 5 - If your opponent ends up with an isolated pawn, make sure you control the square directly in front of it. Aside from stopping the pawn in its tracks, the square will turn out to be an excellent home (support point) for one of your pieces. White's control over d4 stops the isolated d-pawn and gives White's Knight a very nice home. Isolated Pawn Rule 6 - An advanced isolated pawn (i.e., a White pawn on d4 or a Black pawn on d5) gains space and makes its army's pieces active.

IMBALANCES: A CRASH COURSE / 2o

Isolated Pawn Rule 7 - The side playing against the isolated pawn should (ideally) exchange all the minor pieces (they can't get active if they're not on the board!), place a Rook in front of the pawn, immobilizing the poor thing, and put the Queen behind it, doubling on the pawn and putting a lot of pressure on it. (15) White wins the isolated pawn by following a clear formula. In diagram (15) White has followed all the key steps: he has taken control of the square in front of the pawn; he has ex- changed off all the minor pieces; and he has doubled on it and forced the remaining Black units to take up a defensive stance. White now wins this pawn by l.e4 when the pin along the d- file doesn't give Black a way to escape his fate. Backward Pawns A backward pawn is a pawn that has fallen behind its brother pawns and can't be guarded by them. It also can't safely move side by side with them. Backward Pawn Rule 1 - If the backward pawn sits on a half-open file it might be weak. If it isn't on a half-open file, the pawn probably won't become a significant weakness. Backward Pawn Rule 2 - A well-defended back- ward pawn, even if it's sitting on a half-open file, can often shrug off many kinds of attacks.

26 / THE REASSESS YOUR CHESS WORKBOOK

Backward Pawn Rule 3 - Often of more importance than the potential weakness of a backward pawn is the weakness of the square directly in front of it. If the square is adequately guarded by pieces, then the pawn might not be a problem. Backward Pawn Rule 4 - A backward pawn often serves a useful purpose by guarding a pawn that has gone ahead of it. Backward Pawn Rule 5 - Often a backward pawn is backward in name only. If it can safely advance at will, then the label of "backward" should be punted out of one's mind. since it doesn't stand on a half-open file. However, the weakness of the b6-square is obvious. Black's backward pawn on d6 does stand on a half-open file and needs to be defended. Of greater consequence, though, is the gaping hole on d5 which will prove to be a fine home for White's pieces.

IMBALANCES: A CRASH COURSE / 27

(17) Both d6 and d5 are well defended. In diagram (17) the backward pawn on d6 is well defended, as is the d5-square. Since the pawn threatens to advance to d5 at any moment, one can't call d6 or d5 weak. Passed Pawns Most players take it for granted that passed pawns are an advan- tage. Though often true, especially in the endgame, passed pawns can also be a disadvantage! Passed Pawn Rule 1 - If both sides have play elsewhere that has nothing to do with the passer, a passed pawn, even one that isn't playing a dynamic role, can prove useful as an endgame insurance policy. Passed Pawn Rule 2 - When one side owns a passed pawn, the most important square on the board, for both players, is usually the square directly in front of the passer. Passed Pawn Rule 3 - If the passed pawn can be firmly blockaded, then the pawn may end up as a traitor; its very existence may block files and diagonals and thus limit its own Bishops and Rooks, giving the opponent access to a key square (the one in front of the passer) that wouldn't be available if the pawn were not there.

(18) A bad passed pawn. The passed pawn in diagram (18) is firmly blocked by Black's Knight. If Black hadn't taken control of the all-important d6-square, then White could have advanced his pawn by d5-d6, when the "goat" in the diagram suddenly turns into a winning possession! To make matters worse, the traitorous pawn severely limits the scope of White's Rooks, his Bishop, and his Knight! Passed Pawn Rule 4 - If a passed pawn can't be blockaded, the pawn can run down the board and cause panic in the enemy's ranks. The defender will usually be in for a hard ride if the pawn gets safely past the fifth rank. Passed Pawn Rule 5 - In general, the owner of a passed pawn would like to trade off all the minor pieces, thus getting rid of the most usefill blockaders. He would also prefer to retain the Queens and at least one Rook. Keeping the Queens on the board scares the defender's King and stops it from taking on the duties of a blockader.

(19) The White passed pawn is torturing Black. Space When we own property, we usually map out our territory by building a fence. In chess, we also build fences, but in place of timber we use pawns. Space Rule 1 - Extra space is advantageous for one simple reason: the more space we possess, the more room our pieces have to move about in. Space Rule 2 - The side with more space should avoid exchanges since this would give more room to the boxed-in enemy. Space Rule 3 - The side with less territory should actively seek trades since that will transform his cramped quarters into something a bit easier to tolerate. (20) White's pawns give him a huge space advantage.

30 / THE REASSESS YOUR CHESS WORKBOOK

Material A material advantage is a wonderful thing to have because it influences all phases of the game. In the opening and middlegame, the side with extra wood has a larger army. In the endgame, the side with the material deficit usually goes into a deep depression. In fact, this endgame nightmare is often felt in the middlegame because the material-down defender is basi- cally giving endgame odds and this severely limits his options. Material Rule 1 - Most endgames are in your favor. This means that trading pieces is an option that your opponent won't enjoy. Material Rule 2 - If you can make your extra unit of force an active participant in the battle, then do so! Material Rule 3 - If you can't make immediate use of your material plus, don't worry. An extra pawn will act as endgame insurance, threatening your opponent's endgame chances for the rest of the game. Material Rule 4 - When you employ a plan that nets you some extra wood, immediately shore up your weak points and bring all your pieces to squares where they work together. Don't keep lashing out if your army is off balance! Material Rule 5 - If you are behind in material, you must seek out some kind of compensation to justify the deficit. Some common forms of compen- sation are active pieces, a lead in development, possession of the initiative, and extra space.

IMBALANCES: A CRASH COURSE / 31

In diagram (21) White has a Knight and a pawn for a Rook. Black is obviously much better, but his material advantage won't amount to much if he can't create an open file for his Rook. Thus l...b5! rips open the b-file and allows the Rook to eventually penetrate on that newly-opened road. Black's lead in development and control over the hole on d4 gives him ample compensation for the sacrificed pawn. Control of a Key File Rooks belong on open files. We have all heard this on many occasions but, for some reason, few players are able to get the most out of these pieces. Rooks are extremely powerful, no doubt about it. But if that's true, why do they sit around doing nothing for so long? The answer lies in the movements of the other pieces. A Knight just leaps over its pawns and boom, it's active! A Bishop doesn't even

32 / THE REASSESS YOUR CHESS WORKBOOK

have to move; the d-pawn lunges forward and suddenly the lazy cl-Bishop is patrolling the cl-h6 diagonal. Rooks have a much harder time finding a way into the enemy position. However, when they do enter the fray, their enormous strength becomes obvious. Rook Rule 1 - Your Rooks will be useless unless you can create an open file for their use. Rook Rule 2 - An open file is only worth bother- ing with if a Rook can use it to penetrate into the enemy position. If no penetration points exist, then the file is useless. Rook Rule 3 - Usually an open file won't be handed to you on a platter. It's your responsibility to crack open a file; turn your Rook's need into a reality! Rook Rule 4 - An open file will often be equally contested by opposing Rooks. This will usually lead to massive trades. Unfortunately, such things can't be avoided because stepping away from the file would hand it over to the opponent. Files, ranks, and diagonals act as pathways for your pieces, while squares act as homes. An entire plan can center around the domination of a file, or the creation of a weak square in the enemy camp. Two files.

IMBALANCES: A ('RASH COURSE / 33

In diagram (23) the open a-file offers no penetration points for the Black Rooks (al, a2, a3, and a4 are all controlled by White's pieces and pawns). The open e-file is another matter: here White's Rooks have access to e6, e7 and, in some cases, e8. Control of a Key Square Playing for dominance of one single square is a hard concept for many amateurs to understand. Nevertheless, the idea of fighting for squares instead of material or attack is extremely important and must be appreciated if the student wishes to improve his game. Square Rule 1 - The reason one plays for control of a key square (such a square is also known as a "hole") is that it will usually prove to be an excellent home for a Knight or a Bishop, though other pieces can also gain from laying claim to it. Square Rule 2 - Once your piece reaches a hole, it will inevitably be more valuable than its counterpart on the other side of the board. Square Rule 3 - Often entire plans are based on the acquisition of such squares. (24) The square on d5 is owned by White. In diagram (24) it's clear that a White Knight on d5 will be more valuable than Black's Knight on c6.

34 / THE REASSESS YOUR CHESS WORKBOOK

White fights to dominate d5. White to move. In diagram (25) White forces the "win" of the d5-square by l.b5, destroying the defending c-pawn's ability to cover d5. After l...c5 (l...cxb5 2.axb5 allows White's Rook to eye Black's back- ward a-pawn) White would have complete control over the juicy d5-square. Development It is important to develop your whole army. Note the word "whole." Some players get a few pieces out and launch an attack. The correct way to play chess is to develop each and every piece (chess is a team game!), get your King safely castled, and only then begin more aggressive maneuvers. On occasion, a player will fall significantly behind in devel- opment, giving his opponent the opportunity to make use of the greater force that he has in play. To get maximum use of this imbalance, you will have to kick things into high gear (called fast-play) so that some gain can be made before the enemy catches up and nullifies the edge you once possessed. Development Rule 1 - A lead in development is a temporary advantage (structural and material plusses are considered to be long-term or permanent advantages). The opponent will catch up if you don't make immediate use of it. Development Rule 2 - If the center is closed, rapid development is not necessarily a priority (25)

IMBALANCES: A CRASH COURSE / 35

because the enemy pieces won't be able to break into your position. Development Rule 3 - If the center is open (meaning that open files and diagonals penetrate into your camp), rapid development takes on greater significance. (26) White to move. In diagram (26) White has a huge lead in development, but the closed center makes it a non-issue. This position, diagram (27), is the same as the previous one, except that the center pawns have been removed, leaving us with an open center. Now White's lead in development gives him a winning advantage. White would fast-play the position (not giving Black the time to castle and get some pieces out) by l.Bb5+ Kf8 (or l.,,Nc6 2.Bc5, winning the house) 2.Bc5! Qxc5 3-Rd8+ Ne8 4.Rdxe8 mate.

36 / THE REASSESS YOUR CHESS WORKBOOK

initiative The side that forces an opponent to react to his ideas is said to have the initiative. This control over a position can be based on dynamic or static considerations. If you are attacking a weak pawn and your opponent is busy defending it, you have an initiative based on a static advantage. This means that you can often play in a slow or calm manner because a static plus is long lasting. If you are using a lead in development to play for mate, you have the initiative based on a dynamic advantage. Here you play for immediate effect since dynamic pluses often dissipate with the passage of time. The concept of initiative is a very important one in top-flight chess, and both sides struggle for possession of it right out of the starting blocks. Gambits can be used to obtain it, though the price often turns out to be too high. A sudden attack can claim it, or simple positional pressure can grab hold of it for the duration of the game. Initiative Rule 1 - You should always try to impose your will on the character of the game. Initiative Rule 2 - Never mindlessly react to every threat, perceived or real, that your opponent throws your way. This will give him a firm initiative and will leave you passively reacting to his ideas. Initiative Rule 3 - Like a lead in development, the initiative can fade away if you don't make good use of it.

(28) White to move. In diagram (28) Black is fighting to carry out the freeing ...c6- c5 which would activate his b7-Bishop and place pressure on White's center. A normal move by the threatened Knight, like l.Nbl, would allow Black to do this. However, instead of caving in to his opponent's desires, White can grab the initiative by l.Bxf6! gxf6 (l...Bxf6 2.Ne4 gives White permanent control over c5) 2.Ne4 when Black's plan of ...c6-c5 has been nipped in the bud. Occu- pation of the c5-square (Nc5), followed by placing pressure against the potential targets on c6 and a5, will leave White firmly in control of the game.

PROBLEMS / THE OPENING

In this modern age, the opening phase of a chess game has gotten a bad rap. Huge databases, a seem- ingly endless array of opening books, and the sheer volume of variations that, apparently, must be memo- rized, make even the bravest chessplayers want to run and hide. Beginner's books paint a somewhat less intimidat- ing picture of opening play: "Get your pieces out quickly," "Use your pawns to gain space and control the center." The platitudes go on and on. If only the realities of opening mastery were as simple as this. Thanks to these basic books, most players think that the opening revolves around the development of both side's armies. While true in a limited sense, this is actually a view that misses the big picture. The real purpose of the opening is to create a difference, or series of differences, in the respective positions and then develop your pieces around these facts so that, hopefully, these differences (imbalances) will eventu- ally favor you. For example, if you, as White, get to advance your pawns to d4 and e4 while your opponent places his pawns on d6 and e6, you will enjoy a spatial plus. You would then develop your forces in such a man- ner as to highlight this advantage. Another typical example centers around Black play- ing ...Bc8-g4x(Kt)f3 or ...Bf8-b4x(Kt)c3. These com- mon exchanges create an imbalance of Bishop versus

42 / THE REASSESS YOUR CHESS WORKBOOK

Knight. As soon as this appears on the board, White should place his pieces and pawns on squares that highlight the powers of his Bishop(s). Black, on the other hand, should play for a closed position (which is known to usually favor Knights) and try hard to create advanced support points that will ultimately enable his horses to become equal or superior to the enemy Bishops. This view of opening play will enable amateurs to figure out new situations in an intelligent manner (okay, at a higher level at least some memorization is still necessary!). It will allow them to create a plan, verbalize a goal, and then make sure that every pawn advance and piece development caters to the imbalances that you've created in the first few moves. In this section you will see many different opening situations. Once you grasp that everything is geared, in one way or another, to this idea of opening imbalances, the solutions will be easier to find or, at the very least, far easier to understand when you turn to Part Three: Solutions.

PROBLEMS / THE MIDDLEGAME

E>r players who can't stand the memorization that the openings demand, and who become bored when faced with endgames, the middlegame is what "real" chess is all about. Of course, to become a chess master, you must become proficient in all three phases of the game. Nevertheless, the middlegame's possi- bilities have captured the imaginations of millions of players over the centuries, and this is where most amateurs firmly plant their attention. At this level, attacks and combinations (exciting, beautiful, yet also holding a certain air of mystery) sound their siren call to chess lovers everywhere. At higher levels, too, this phase of the game has many pleasing character- istics: primal kingside attacks are created, subtle stra- tegic plans are put into motion, and preparations for the endgame are quietly, sometimes secretly, begun. Many games don't get past the middlegame. A checkmate ends matters in no uncertain terms, huge material losses convince experienced players to re- sign the contest in disgust, and the specter of a lost endgame can also lead a player to tip his King over in a gesture of defeat. The problems in this section run the gamut from quiet positional maneuvering to attacking in earnest. It's up to you to feel the ebb and flow of the posi- tion, to understand whether static or dynamic play is called for, and to make use of the imbalances at all

With this in mind, figure out if you must play fast or slow when you possess: a. A lead in development. b. An isolated d-pawn. c. Play against your opponent's backward pawn. d. The initiative. e. A material advantage. f. A superior minor piece. g. Play against a weak square in the enemy camp. h. An advantage in space.

23. True or false:

a. It's better to be behind in material than to have a position that's devoid of activity. b. A Bishop should usually be considered as slightly better than a Knight. c. Bishops enjoy open positions. d. A Rook reaches the zenith of its power on the eighth rank. e. A Rook on the seventh rank is often worth a pawn. f. Two Rooks on the seventh are known as "roving eaters." g. An attack against the enemy King is the most effective plan in chess. h. Knights are most effective on the eighth rank. i. A protected passed pawn is always a good thing to have. Problem 39 A systematic pawn advance designed to knock aside the opponent's pawn fortifications is known as a pawn break. Name some advantages that this kind of pawn advance might bring.

Problem 64 (90) White to move. A common position has been reached. White usually tries to place pressure against the "hanging pawns" on c5 and d5. Black relies on his extra space (which those "weak" pawns supply) and his active pieces to turn the game in his favor. White wanted to make use of the f5-square via l.Nh4 with the intention of Nf5. Unfortu- nately, l...g5 picks up material. Since this doesn't work, he hatches an original idea designed to take away key queenside squares from the Black forces. Do you see what White found?

White has more central space and is preparing a central advance by Nf3 and e4-e5. White also has good chances against the Black King because all of White's pieces are aiming in that direction, while nothing much is happening on the queenside. To say that the queenside is equal and the center and kingside favor White, speaks for itself. What is Black going to do about this state of affairs? His Rook is under attack and a swap would give White control of the open b-file.

Problem 84 (110) Grefe-Bellin, World Open 1973. Black to move. White, 1973 U.S. Champion John Grefe, seems to be doing very well. He has lots of kingside and central space, he has a firm grip on the important d4-square, pressure against a6 and possibilities of opening the c-file by c2-c3- It's also important to note how bad the b7-Bishop is.

us. Self-destructive ideas come up in almost every amateur game I have seen and, after lots of thinking, the closest thing to a cure I have found is the following: Whenever you are about to play a move in chess, always ask: "What wonderful thing does this move do for my position?" As simple as this may sound, I have never had a student who could follow this advice. Why? I honestly don't know. Perhaps the fire of battle blinds us to lessons of the past. Perhaps this verbal inquiry into a move's usefulness leaves a bad taste in one's mouth. In this game White, who was worried about ...exd4 with threats to his e-pawn, played l.d5, gaining central space. Was this a wise thing to do? What wonderful thing does this move to for White's position? Problem 86 (112) Black to move. How would you handle the Black position?

PROBLEMS / THE ENDGAME

jN lost players study the opening to get a quick, positive start to the game-sort of a fast-food solution to chess strength. Others wisely push the opening books to the side and put more time into middlegame play. Very few, though, take time out to explore the complicated and largely unknown world of the endgame. I guess there are good reasons why the endgame is ignored: > Some players constantly lose before that phase is ever reached! This, of course, is a bad excuse. An understanding of the endgame will significantly strengthen your middlegame play. > Some feel that the endgame is too subtle for players below the expert rank. Wrong again! Endgame basics are easy to pick up and will reward you with victories throughout your chess career. > Endgame books are dry and turn chess study into a form of torture. Well, I must admit that this is the case with many books. However, there are exceptions that contain interesting prose, fun ex- amples, and rules of endgame conduct that guarantee an enjoyable and educa- tional read.

100 / THE REASSESS YOUR CHESS WORKBOOK

It might seem improbable, but a firm knowledge of endgame basics, giving you a 2100 endgame rating, won't take more than four or five hours to study and assimilate. For example, a thor- ough knowledge of the opposition for King and pawn endgames, taking all of fifteen minutes to learn, is extremely important. Rook endgame basics like the Lucena and Philidor positions are also something that a serious player can't do without. Both these po- sitions can be fully understood in ten minutes. The fact of the matter is, once you've mastered this kind of basic endgame material, you can use these themes to work out more complex endgames that would have previously been out of your reach. If you don't know the basics, which are easily found in any one of dozens of endgame manuals, you'll be like a blind man trying to wend his way through a maze. The problems in this section are a mix of both very compli- cated and very basic endgame situations. Hopefully, they will make you ralize just how fascinating this final phase of the game can be.

PROBLEMS / SELF-ANNOTATIONS

p JL layers of all strengths constantly ask me how to get better. Seeking some sort of generic cure-all, they ex- pect me to bark out a few words of wisdom and make their lives easier and their ratings fatter. Like a magic eight ball, all titled players come with juicy platitudes, many of which might be offered up on the altar of profundity: Profound Platitude 1 - Good things happen to those that work hard! This one always creates a frown. Who in the world wants to work a nine to five job, come home, take out their chessboard, and suddenly realize that the truly exhausting work is only now beginning? Profound Platitude 2 - Study endgames first. The middlegame and opening can be contemplated later in your chess development Another winning piece of hot air. After years of study, you come to the board armed with a deep un- derstanding of the true meaning of coordinate squares in King and pawn endgames. Unfortunately, you fall for a basic opening trap and fail to make it past the fifteenth move. Profound Platitude 3 - Send me a check and we'll see what can be done.

11O / THE REASSESS YOL'R CHESS WORKBOOK

A lifetime ago, John Grefe (right after winning the U.S. Closed Championship) gave me a shortened version of this (i.e., "Where's your money?") when I asked him a chess-related question. More recently, a well-known grandmaster responded in this same way when confronted by an earnest teenage chess addict. Needless to say, I've never seen this answer actually improve anyone's game. Profound Platitude 4 - It's not tbe openings themselves that are important, but the ideas behind them. Since most opening books only deal in endless masses of moves and little explanation of the ideas behind them, the poor student is forced to go back to Profound Platitude 3 if he wants any real answers in this area. Profound Platitude 5 - It's not winning that counts. Tbe joy of playing the game is its own reward. Yeah, right. After absorbing this bit of swill from your chess guru, bide your time and watch closely when he actually loses. Note how his fists flail in the air, how his face has turned beet red, how endless excuses seem to be pouring from his gibber- ing lips. These platitudes aren't very helpful, are they? The truth is, the best chess advice that I've ever gotten can be summed up in the following way: Look at lots and lots of annotated master games! So simple and yet so rewarding. You see openings explained by the master himself, middlegames dissected and discussed in great detail, and endgames lovingly reenacted by the World Cham- pion of your choice. In other words, you get the whole package! Master games can be gone over in several ways: ♦ Play over dozens, or even hundreds, of them quickly, chess movie style, a couple of minutes per game. Your subconscious will digest different patterns, even as your conscious mind reels from the never-ending flow of mysterious chess moves.

PROBLEMS / SELF-ANNOTATIONS / 111

♦ Play through them slowly. Explore every note and comment that the master offers. ♦ Quickly play through the opening phase of the game, cover up your hero's moves and try to figure out what he did. Write your thoughts and guesses down in a notebook, check to see what was really played, and then repeat. When the game is finished, look at it again and study the master's notes. See how close his thinking process and move selection came to yours. ♦ Jot down questions whenever you don't understand a specific plan, position, move, or comment. Then share this material with your chess teacher. Hmmmm, we seem to have come back to Profound Platitude 3 again! In this section, well be taking the idea of an annotated game a step further. Here you will be expected to analyze the game, or a cluster of moves, by yourself before looking at my notes. By doing this, the moves and notes will take on a much deeper and more personal meaning for you.

Kd6 40.b3 b5 41.bxc4 Bxc4 42.a4 Kd5 43-axb5 Bxb5 44.Rfl Bxfl, 0-1. Black, whose ...f7-f5 was answered by exf5, has to recap- ture his pawn on f5. What's the best way to do this? l...Rxf5 doesn't make any sense for a number of rea- sons: It places the Rook on a vulnerable square, gives White control over e4, and doesn't make any particu- lar gains. But l...Bxf5 would probably prove very tempting to most players. In fact, how can a move that recaptures a pawn, develops a piece, and threatens the enemy Queen be bad? The problem with l...Bxf5 is that White gains con- trol over the e4-square after 2.Nde4. Then 2...Nf6 3.Bxc5 dxc5 4.Bd3 favors White since the pawn structure is in his favor and e4 will remain in his hands. Also good for the first player is l...Bxf5 2.Nde4 Nxe4 3.Nxe4 Bxe4

4.Qxe4 Nf6 5.Qc2. In this case, White owns the two

Bishops and will generate queenside play with an even- tual c4-c5.

PENING

122 / THE REASSESS YOUR CHESS WORKBOOK

So it turns out that l...Bxf5, for all its glitter and bluster, really doesn't do much for the Black position because it doesn't give Black anything new to work with other than regaining the pawn. Black's best move is 1...gxf5, a move that horrifies many play- ers because they think they are opening up their kingside. Putting this misconception aside for a moment, let's list the move's good points: ♦ It keeps the White pieces off of e4. ♦ Black's central pawns are now mobile and both sides will always have to weigh the pros and cons of moves like ...f5-f4 and ...e5-e4. Moving the f-pawn to f4 hands over the e4-square. Pushing the e-pawn to e4 gives up the f4-square, though in some lines he might be willing to do this since it ensures that his g7-Bishop will have an active future. Compare this with l...Bxf5 2.Nde4 when the g7-Bishop is doomed to play a passive role. ♦ It opens the g-file. Here we finally square off with the view that Black's King is open. Who has more space on the kingside? Black, of course. This means that he will seek his chances on that side of the board since you usually play where your spatial plus exists. So the open g-file fits right into Black's plans, and he will try and make uSe of it by playing ...Kh8 and ...Rg8 at the right time. Once again, it's important that the student looks at both l...Bxf5 and l...gxf5 with fresh eyes. One move (l...Bxf5) doesn't do any- thing to help Black's kingside hopes and gives White the use of a great square, while the other offers the second player several positional plusses. Summary of Imbalances and Ideas [diagram (142)] > White owns more queenside space thanks to his pawns on c4 and d5.

> White would like to add to his queenside gains by an eventual a2-a3 followed by b3-b4, chasing the Black Knight away from its excellent perch and preparing to rip open lines in that area. Plus, this will open files for the Rooks, which would like to penetrate into the enemy position after c4-c5. > Black's c7-d6-e5 pawn chain gives him more kingside space. He would like to translate this into an eventual kingside attack. > Black is a pawn down and must decide how to get his pawn back. If possible, the recapture of the pawn should aid in his kingside dreams! > At the moment, White's Knights and Queen are eyeing the e4-square. If possible, Black should avoid letting this important central square fall into enemy hands. Problem 2 (143) Bondarevsky-Smyslov, Moscow Championship 1946. White to move.

How should White react to this advance of Black s f-pawn? Before judging the diagrammed position, let's first take a look at the following, once popular, opening variation: l.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3-Bb5 a6 4.Ba4 Nf6 5.d4 exd4 6.O-O Be7 7.e5 Ne4 8.Nxd4 O-O

Here White was considered to be better for quite a while thanks to his active kingside majority-the threat of f2-f4-f5 is quite annoying. However, 11...f5! ended the variation's popu- larity since the resulting White passed pawn will be firmly blocked by ...Ne6. For example, the position after 12.f4? Ne6 13-Nxe6 Bxe6 favors Black because there is no longer any play on the kingside or in the center, while all the queenside chances reside with Black because his Bishops aim in that direction and he also enjoys a pawn majority there. Once we understand that a passed pawn is useless if firmly blockaded (in fact, it can actually turn into a disadvantage!), we can see that White's best move from the diagram is certainly not

13.e5 since 13...Ne6 14.Bd2 g5, stopping White from challenging

the blockade by Ne2-f4, can only be good for the second player. In passed pawn situations the game often hinges on the square in front of the pawn. If the owner of the passer can control that square, then the pawn is usually a big plus. However, if the de- fender gains complete control over the square in front of the pawn, then the passed pawn turns into a dud. Thus, once you bite into the blockading square, it's very important not to allow the oppo- nent to make a successful challenge to your dominance of it. With all this in mind, it should now be clear that a skilled player only accepts a passed pawn if he feels he has play else- where (and thus its advance isn't of any great importance), or if he can prevent the defender from setting up a successful blockade. Since 13.e5 isn't good, and since the position is about to open up, it is wise for White to strive for equality by ridding Black of his two Bishops. This can be done by 13.Bg5! when the chances will be more or less even. Summary of Imbalances and Ideas [diagram (143)] > Black has just played ...f7-f5 and threatens to win a piece by ...fxe4, with a double attack on f4 and f3.

> Black's queenside pawn structure has been compromised. However, the doubled pawns are proving rather useful at the moment: the c7-pawn stops White from leaping into d6, while the c6-pawn kills the Knight on c3 by keeping it off of d5. > White doesn't want to open the position if Black retains his two Bishops. > White can create a passed pawn via e4-e5- However, if he does so, who will control the e6-square in front of the passer? > Since Black owns two Bishops, is there any way for White to swap one ofP Problem 3 After l.e4 e5 2,Nf3 Nc6 3-Bb5 a6 4.Ba4 Nf6 5.O-O Be7 6.Qe2 b5 7.Bb3 0- 0 8.c3 d6 9.d4 Bg4 lO.Rdl exd4 H.cxd4 d5 12.e5 Ne4 13.a4 bxa4 14.Bxa4 Nb4 15.h3 Bh5 16.Nc3 Bg6 17.Be3 Rb8, we reach a position that was once thought to be all right for Black.

(144) Short-Karpov, Linares Match 1992 White to move. Short played the surprising and strong 18.Na2!l. This idea of Anand's, who helped Short in his pre-match preparations for the Karpov match, shows that White considers the b4-Knight to be much more important than its brother on e4. The reason is

126 / THE REASSESS YOUR CHESS WORKBOOK

simple: the b4-Knight is the main guardian of Black's weak points on a6, c6 and d5. By trading it off, all these sore spots become accentuated and Black is suddenly placed on the defensive. As you can see, it's important to list all the negatives in the enemy camp. Once you're aware of them, you should look for a way to make them as vulnerable as possible. On occasion, a par- ticular piece is the glue that holds things together. A simple ex- change can sometimes send your opponent's house of cards crash- ing to the ground.

Problem 4 What do the following two fairly well-known opening systems have in common' The answer lies in the meaning of Black's ...g7-g5 advance. l.ea c5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3-d4 cxd4 4.Nxd4 g6 5.c4 Bg7 6,Be3 Nf6 7,\c3 Ng4 8.Qxg4 Nxd4 9.Qdl Ne6 lO.Rcl Qa5 ll.Bd3 b6 12.O-O g5.

(146) White to move. In both casus Black is fighting to gain control of the e5-square and turn it into a permanent home for his pieces. Allow mu to explain in more detail: During a lecture in Los Angeles where I would look at people's games and comment on them. I noted that many members of the audience were able to recognize weak squares, but only if these weaknesses already existed. However, the idea of creating a weakness was alien to them. To illustrate the concept of creating such weaknesses, even in the opening. I offered the following example:

128 / THE REASSESS YOL'R CHESS WORKBOOK

l.e4 c5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3-d4 cxd4 4,Nxd4 g6 5.c4 Bg7 6.Be3 Nf6 7-Nc3 Ng4 8.Qxg4 Nxd4 9-Qdl Ne6 lO.Rcl Qa5 H.Bd3 b6

12.O-O

I would prefer 12.f4, stopping the following maneuver.

12...g5

Most of the sixty or so players watching my lecture thought this was horrible, though a few liked the idea of starting an imme- diate attack against the White King. My first order of business was to explain that 12...g5 had nothing to do with attacking the White King. Instead, Black is fighting to gain absolute control over the e5-square. How does ...g6-g5 affect the e5-square? By stopping f2-f4, White won't be able to use a pawn to chase away a Black piece that decides to reside on e5. Thus, e5 becomes an important sup- port point. Actually, it's known as an artificial support point-a manufactured weak square!

13.Qd2 Bb7 14.Rfdl d6 15.a3 h5 16.Rc2 Bd4!

Also good is 16...Qe5, but it makes sense for Black to ex- change dark-squared Bishops because White's Bishop is one of the only pieces that can eventually attack e5.

17.b4 Qe5 and Black's control over the dark-squares, particu-

larly e5, gave him a good game in Ljubojevic-Korchnoi, Tilburg 1987. The crowd didn't seem particularly convinced, so I threw yet another opening at them where playing for the e5-square was everything: l.e4 c5 2.Nf3 d6 3 d4 cxd4 4.Nxd4 Nf6 5.Nc3 a6 6.Bg5 e6

7.f4 Be7 8.Qf3 Qc7 9.O-O-O Nbd7 10.Bd3 h6 ll.Bh4 g5

Black goes all out to remove White's f4-pawrn from the board, even if it means losing a pawn, so that the e5-square will fall into his hands.

Summary of Imbalances and Ideas [diagrams (145) and (146)] > Playing to create a weak square in the enemy camp that will eventually become a home for one of your own pieces-preferably a Knight-is a mainstay of advanced chess strategy. > At times a square isn't weak in the normal sense, but you can make it so by ensuring that the enemy pawns can't ever chase your pieces from the square you are after. The game used in our first example highlights ...g7-g5 as doing this: White wants to chase the Black pieces from the e5-square, but his inability to play f2-f4 makes this a vain hope. > In both examples, Black creates an imbalance-a weakness on e5-by the unorthodox ...g7-g5. The price? Black can't castle kingside (leaving your King in the center isn't a joy). This support point, and the weaknesses in Black's kingside that came about by creating the support point with ...g7-g5, all become the focus of the ensuing play.

Problem 5 After l.d4 Nf6 2.Bg5 Ne4 3.Bh4 c5 4.Qd3, (from Winterton-Rajlich, North Bay 1997) we arrive at an interesting position. Black's Knight is attacked and he has to decide how this threat should be dealt with. What is the correct decision here? Believe it or not, we have already come to the key moment in this game! White is attacking the enemy Knight and hopes to wrest control of the e4-square from his opponent. Black's choices ap- pear to be fairly clear: he can run with his Knight, he can defend it with 4...d5 (4...f5 is too weakening), or he can throw in 4...Qa5+, though it's not clear what Black has accomplished after 5.c3- But why let White force you into a certain direction? He has played this strange new move (4.Qd3) and dares to tell you what to do! Are you going to put up with this? Before reacting, first try and detect the flaws in White's position. Did you find some? Here is the list:

4 Moving that dark-squared Bishop to g5 left the

b2-pawn unprotected.

4 The Bishop on h4 is not guarded. Remember, all

unprotected pieces should be noted since this state of affairs allows tactical operations against them.

4 The d4-pawn is under pressure.

4 The cl -square doesn't have a defender.

4 The al-Rook is unprotected.

SOLUTIONS / THE OPENING / 131

Can Black make use of these facts? During an actual game try to spot all positional and tactical possibilities and then try7 as hard as you can to make something of them. Never tell yourself that you must do this or must do that. The word "must" should be taken out of your chess vocabulary!

4...QB6!

Instead of bowing to White's wishes, Black shocks his oppo- nent by ignoring the illusory enemy threat. The very fine 4...Qb6 threatens to pick up the b-pawn and the Rook. It may be hard to accept, but this move actually wins by force!

5.b3

Of course, 5.Qxe4 Qxb2 followed by 6...Qxal would win for Black. Now White has renewed the threat against e4 and has kept the Black Queen out of b2 (or has he?).

5...Qh6!

Suddenly the h4-Bishop's lack of a defender becomes impor- tant and the weakness of cl combines to create an almost comic situation. Note how, once again, Black ignores White's "threat." How many players would bow to the fact that the e4-Knight is under attack?

6.Nf3

Develops and defends h4. Slightly worse is 6.Qxe4?? Qcl mate.

6...QC1+ 7.Qdl

White's pawn on d2 is backward and weak, the d4-square is owned by Black, and all the Black pieces will be very active. In general, a pure sacrifice for development or attack entails a leap of faith.

(150) Black to move. If you had to choose between 7...Bg4, 7...Nbd7, 7...Na6, 7...Ne8,

7...g6, and 7...h6, which would you play?

Quick development is a good idea, but only if you are placing your pieces on squares where they can work writh the other pieces toward a common goal! In other words, don't just move them for the sake of saying they are developed! Find their optimum homes and go out of your way to get them there. In the position under discussion after White's 7.Nge2, the moves 7...Bg4 and 7...Nbd7 mindlessly develop a piece without any thought to the pawn structure or an actual plan. Tossing the Knight to the side with 7...Na6 is more sensible, because Black is at least showing some interest in playing for a ...b7-b5 advance via 8...Nc7 followed by 9--.a6 and 10...Rb8-in other words, Black has a clear reason for his move; it doesn't matter if its actually any good or not. The two kingside pawrn moves are not particularly attractive: 7...g6 allows 8.Bh6 when the Rook must move to the inferior e8-square (it wants to stay on f8 so it can help with an eventual ...17-f5 advance). Even worse is 7...h6, a move that

136 / THE REASSESS YOUR CHESS WORKBOOK

doesn't do anything at all. White wasn't threatening Bg5, so why spend a valuable move on nothing? Though 7...Na6, intending queenside expansion, is play- able, much stronger is 7...Ne8L This odd-looking move not only ignores development, but it actually breaks two other 'laws" at the same time: ♦ Never bring a Knight to the first rank. + Never move the same piece twice in the opening. What could be the reason for such madness? Take a few moments and tty to figure it out for yourself. Black didn't bring his other Knight out, or move his Bishop to g4, because those moves didn't help him pursue the most effective plan. This plan centers around the pawn advance ...f7-f5. In a closed position, you must play for pawn advances on the wings. This kind of pawn advance gives you more space to maneuver in, and also opens up lines for your Rooks. The nifty Knight retreat 7...Ne8 prepares ...Bg5, exchanging a poor piece for a good one, and also intends to continue with ...g6 (more preparation for ...f7-f5), when Bh6 can be comfortably met by ...Ng7 which defends the Rook and aims another piece at f5. Of course, 7...Ne8 also gets out of the way of the f-pawn; some- thing that has to be done if the ...f7-f5 advance is ever going to be possible.

Problem 9 (151) Black to move. This popular main line position of the King's Indian Defense, reached after l.d4 Nf6 2.c4 g6 3.Nc3 Bg7 4.e4 d6 5.Be2 O-O 6.Nf3 e5 7.O-O Nc6

8.d5 Ne7 9. Nel, is a good test to see if you understand what's expected

when a closed position is reached in the opening. Black has only two logical moves here. Can you list them? To find the answer, you will have to understand the nature of the position as a whole. When the center is closed, play must be sought on the wings. However, instead of aiming for piece play as you would in an open position, you should instead lead with your pawns so that territory is gained and half-open or open files for the Rooks are created. How can you determine which side of the board to play on? Just look at where your pawns point and play in that direction because that's where your maximum space lies. In the present position, Black's pawn chain points to the kingside (c7-d6-e5). Thus, he needs to push the pawn that stands next to the top of his chain (e5 is the top of the pawn chain). This means that ...f7-f5 is his plan when Black's space advantage on the kingside would then be clear. White's chain at e4-d5 aims at the queenside, so an eventual space-gaining c4-c5 advance is called for. If Black had a pawn on c5 instead of e5, then White would play for e4-e5-

138 / THE REASSESS YOUR CHESS WORKBOOK

With these facts in mind, the only moves that make sense for Black are 9-.-Nd7 or 9-..Ne8. If you tried 9-.Bd7, you are caught up in the trap of "development at all costs." Don't de- velop if it has nothing to do with the needs of the position! By moving the Knight back to d7 or e8, Black gets out of the way of the f-pawn and prepares his thematic ...f7-f5 advance.

Problem 10 In a skittles game, after l.e4 g6 2.d4 Bg7 3.Nf3 d6, White played 4.h3 and said, "Strengthening d4 and e5." Does this make sense, or did he have too much to drink before the game? (152) Black to move. Though it's not clear if White did or didn't have too much to drink, his comment makes perfect sense-though why he would announce this is another matter! White's f3-Knight is a key piece in the fight for the d4 and e5 squares. By playing h3-not the

Problem 11 After l.e4 g6 2.d4 Bg7 3-Nf3 d6 4.h3 Nf6 5.Nc3 c6 White often plays 6,a4, stopping Black from gaining queenside space with ...b7-b5 and, in many lines, threatening to play a4-a5 with a clear spatial plus in that sector. Black can now reply with 6...a5. What are the pros and cons of this move? (153') Black has just played 6...a5- Solution 11 A On the plus side, 6...a5 stops White's a-pawn in its tracks and lays claim to the b4-square, which he can occupy with ...Nb8-a6-b4. The one negative aspect of 6...a5 is that it weakens the b6-

140 / THE REASSESS YOUR CHESS WORKBOOK

square. Though this weakness seems inconsequential at the mo- ment, it could turn out to be a real problem. To properly explore the question of b6 becoming a weak- ness, let's carry out the sequence in the following manner: 7.Be3 0-08.Qd2 Na69*Be2 Qc7, At times Black can consider a ...d6-d5 thrust. However, then the drawbacks of his earlier ...a7-a5 would show themselves: 9...d5 10.exd5 cxd5 and a gaping hole has ap- peared on b5. If the a-pawn were still on a7, then ...a7-a6 would cover this point. Note the similarity between Black's hole on b5 and White's on b4. After 9-..d5 10,exd5 cxd5 Black can't defend b5. White, though, can always chase Black invaders out of b4 with a timely c2-c3. 10.O-O e5 ll.dxe5 dxe5 12.Radl.This posi- tion, a logical consequence of 6...a5, is very nice for White be- cause he can now show us why the ...a7-a5 advance was not covered with gold. A close look will convince any player that the b6-square has been seriously compromised. White will play di- rectly for the occupation of either b6 or d6 with 13-Qcl!,14.Nd2 and 15-Nc4 when the b6 and d6 squares can now be called holes. Of course, Black might be able to chop this Knight off with ...Bc8- e6xc4, but then White would enjoy two Bishops in an open posi- tion. Summary of Imbalances and Ideas [diagram (153)] > White has a nice center, and Black will eventually try and chip away at it by ...d6-d5 or ...e7-e5. Now that Black has played ...a7-a5, he won't consider ...c6-c5 because that would leave a gaping wound on b5. > A potential weakness has appeared on b6. White can try and make use of it by Be3.

Problem 12 After l.c4 e5 2.Nc3 Nc6 3.Nf3 g6 4.g3 Bg7 5.d3 d6 6.Bg2 f5 7.O-O Nf6. White usually plays for a b2-b4 advance. Why is this advance impor- tant, and should he prepare it with 8.Rbl or 8.a3? (154) White to move. White's pawns are pointing towards the queenside so that is where he should seek his play (always play where your territory lies). Since closed or semi-closed centers dictate that you use pawns to add to your spatial plus and to open up files for your Rooks, White needs to advance his b-pawn to b5 which also loosens up the g2-a8 diagonal for the g2-Bishop. This leads us to the big question: why not prepare b2-b4 with a2-a3 instead of Rbl? First, b2-b4 creates a loosening of the al-h8 diagonal. Getting the al -Rook off that diagonal makes good tacti- cal sense' Second, b2-b4-b5 might eventually lead to the opening of the b-file if Black were to play ...c7-c6 at some point. If that happens, you want your Rook on bl controlling that file1. Finally, 8"Rbl actually saves time! Let's take a look at the following pos- sible moves: 8.a3 O-O 9.b4 a6. Now White would like to advance to b5 and. if Black chopped that pawn off, he would prefer to capture towards the center. Obviously, this would not be possible as things stand. Thus, lO.Rbl followed by 11.a4 and then 12. b5 is called for. If White plays correctly, though, with 8.Rbl, then the same moves won't prove bothersome at all: 8...O-O 9-b4 a6 10.a4 followed by 11.b5 when White has gained a full move over the previous variation.

In this case, White can't put any heat on the Black King at all. 3".Nf6 4.Bg5?! This move is poor because White has no intention of captur- ing on f6. Since Black can end the pin with ...Be7, why is the Bishop going to g5?

Sigh...ignorance really can be bliss, can't it?

7...Qe8??

A horrible move. Black makes two huge mental mistakes here. First he misses the winning 7...Nxd5. All right, we have all missed tactical shots at one time or another. Worse is the fact that Black wants to play a trick based on a ...Nxe4 tactic, contorting himself to set it up-by getting into that frame of mind, he ceases to worry about solid positional concepts like development or con- trol over the center. Never play for tricks; you have to believe that your opponent will always play the best move. 8-Ng3 White takes aim at the juicy square on f5 and ignores Black's tactical attempt. Suddenly Black realized that his intended 8...Nxe4?? would fail to 9.Ngxe4 when g5 is protected. It is also important to mention that 8...Nxd5?? now loses to 9.Nxd5 Bxg5 10.Nxc7-cour- tesy of the Queen move to e8! After 8.Ng3 White had a clear advantage but Black somehow went on to win the game anyway. This game shows us that the most natural moves in the world become blunders if you overlook elementary tactics.

List the im- balances and. from that, deduce White's correct plan and his best move. Solution 14 The main imbalance in this position centers around the powerful b2-Bishop vs. the far less active Black Knight. Everything White does should be aimed at enhancing this particular advantage. Many players, of course, would get bent out of shape over the fact that White's King is open and that his pawns are doubled. However, these things are actually a plus: the doubled pawn on f3 keeps the Black Knight off of e4 and g4-following Steinitz's rule that the way to beat Knights is to take away all their advanced posts- while the open g-file can be used by White after Khl and Rgl. This idea of playing on the g-file fits in nicely with the b2- Bishop's presence, since both take aim at the g7-point. You wouldn't play on the g-file if it had nothing to do with your other imbalances. With these facts in mind, White would be badly mistaken if he tried 19.Bxf6 because he would be giving up his super Bishop for an inferior minor piece. It would also be incorrect to trade Rooks or allow a trade of Rooks since that would limit your attacking potential and end any ideas you might have had of playing down the half-open g-file. This leaves us wondering where to move our Rook. Evi- dently, the best choice is 19.Rbl, placing it on a half open file

and intending Khl followed by Rgl. In that case, most of White's pieces would be working together. White's Queen is aimed at the Ringside, as are the Rook and Bishop.

White to move.

SOLUTIONS / THE OPENING / 147

SolutionLS This move has become a common answer to 6.Be2 and is known as the Boleslavsky Variation. Though moves such as 6...e5 have to be played with great care due to the subsequent weakness of the d5-square, in the present case it's acceptable to allow the creation of this hole. Of course, Black will have to make sure he retains pieces that can guard it. Thus, after 7.Nf3 Black would play 7...h6l, stopping 8.Bg5 followed by Bxf6, when a key de- fender of d5 has been removed. After 8.O-O Be7 9.Rel O-O 10.h3 a6 ll.Bfl b5 ? Black would have an active position with chances for both sides. Many years ago, the Czech Grandmaster Pachman mentioned this position and listed the ideas behind 6...e5 in the following way: ♦ Control of d4 and f4, preventing White from occupying d4. ♦ Preventing the dangerous e4-e5. ♦ Preparing a speedy development with ...Be7 and ...Be6, when he has control of d5. ♦ Often Black succeeds in playing ...d6-d5. If White seeks to prevent this, he must generally occupy the d5-square with a Knight and, after Black exchanges the piece, retake with his e-pawn. The result is then a superiority on the kingside for Black. ♦ It is interesting to note that Black's operations on the c-file are mostly more effective than White's on the d-file, for the pawn on d6, protected by the Bishop, is a great barrier for White.

> By playing ...e7-e5, Black has left himself with a backward pawn on d6 and a hole on d5. The battle will revolve around whether White can make use of these factors. Problem 16 (158) White to move. This common type of position and the plans that come out of it was first brought to world attention in the game Botvinnik-Capablanca, AVRO 1938 which White won brilliantly. Though this position isn't quite the same as the Botvinnik-Capablanca game, the ideas are identical and have been used in many guises. See if you can spot White's most effective plan, and Black's best counter to it. White has two Bishops and a central majority of pawns. If he wants to make use of both these factors, he should play taking the e4 and g4-squares away from the Black Knight and preparing for an eventual central expansion by e3-e4. Of course, this might take a while to actualize, and moves like Qel-f2- giving more support to e3 and d4-Bd2, Rael, and Ng3 will most likely be played at some time or other. However, when White finally manages to successfully play e3-e4, the center pawns can easily become very strong. Black's answer to this idea is to play in a prophylactic manner by ...c7-c5, putting pressure on d4, ...b6 and ...Bb7, increasing the pressure against e4, ...Qc7, and ...Rad8, placing more heat on d4. In this way Black not only makes e3-e4 difficult to achieve, he also makes a statement to the effect that the center pawns will become targets if White succeeds in their advance.

which of the following White moves appear to be most threatening to the second player: 8.h3, 8.d5, 8.Qc2, 8.Qb3, 8.Ngl, 8.Nd2. White has several good moves in this position: 8.Qd2, 8.O-O, 8.Rcl and even the ugly 8.h4 are all common. But only one of the listed choices confronts Black with any real problems. To make a proper decision, you will first have to understand Black's idea behind ...Bg4 followed by ...Nfd7. He actually has two ideas in mind, both centering around the d4-square: ♦ Black might play ...c7-c5, hitting d4, when d5 can be answered by ...Bxc3+, ruining White's queenside pawn structure. ♦ Black also intends to play ...Nc6, hitting d4, followed by chopping off the f3-Knight, one of the main defenders of d4, and ...e7-e5. Then d4-d5 can be answered by ...Nd4 when this important central square falls into Black's hands. Clearly, anything White does should address these two Black plans. White has an advantage in central space, so if he can suc- cessfully nullify Black's threats, he'll be able to come out of the opening with a promising position. Let's go down the list of moves:

8.h3 doesn't make any sense since it virtually forces Black to

continue with his planned conquest of d4: 8...Bxf3 9.Bxf3 Nc6 when the threat of 10...e5 ensures Black good play.

8.d5 doesn't seem logical. Why open the al-h8 diagonal for

Black's Bishop and give Black's Knight access to the c5 and e5 squares?

8.Qc2? moves the Queen to a useless square where it no longer

protects the besieged d4 pawn. Black gets a fine position with

8...Bxf3 9.Bxf3 Nc6.

8,Qb3 is simply answered by 8...Qc8 when White's Queen isn't well placed on b3 because it has nothing to do with the d4- square.

SOLUTIONS / THE OPENING / 151

8.Nd2? cuts off the White Queen's view of d4. After 8...Bxe2

9.Qxe2 Nc6, Black's threats against d4 are beginning to come to

fruition.

8.Ngl! is the only one of the listed moves that actually makes

sense. Though it might look a bit odd, a serious study of its vir- tues will quickly convince the student that it smacks of logic. The first point is that Black's g4-Bishop has nowhere to run. Thus,

8...Bxe2 is forced, when 9.Ngxe2 allows White to maintain his

grip on d4. Compare this with the original position in which ...Bxf3, taking a defender away from d4, was threatened. Another, somewhat more esoteric, point is that Black's nor- mal plan of 9...e5 10.d5 f5 isn't as effective as it usually is in the King's Indian because his light-squared Bishop plays a major role in the ensuing kingside attack. Exchanging these Bishops is usu- ally favorable to White, since he's trading off Black's good Bishop for White's bad one. The most important thing to realize, though, is that all the listed moves, with the exception of 8.Ngl, failed to deal with the threats against d4. Summary of Imbalances and Ideas [diagram (159)] > You can't find a proper move unless you know what your opponent's up to and what your best plan is. > Black's Bishop is striking at d4, while his other Bishop is striking at one of the main defenders of that same square.

Problem 18 (160) White to move. If you had to choose between l.Be3, l.Bd2, or l.Na4, which would you play? The answer should be very clear. Playing l.Bd2 develops the Bishop, but why would it want to be on such a passive square? Don't develop just for the sake of development! Even worse is l.Na4?" since l...Ba7 leaves the Knight looking very silly on a4. In fact, Black threatens to win a piece by 2...b5. Correct is l.Be3, since l...Bxe3 (If I was Black, I would avoid this capture; indeed, I'd let White take on c5 since, after ...dxc5, the half-open d-file and the grip on d4 would ensure Black a happy future.) 2.fxe3 leads to a tremendous improvement in White's position. Why? There are several reasons: 1) The squares on d4 and f4 were vulnerable. Now, after 2.fxe3, neither can be touched by a Black piece. 2) Black's c5-Bishop is clearly superior to White's undeveloped piece on cl. Thus, trading an inactive unit for an active enemy piece makes good sense. 3) White's pawn on f2 isn't doing anything. In fact, it's not playing any real role in the battle. Also, White's fl-Rook is just a bystander. After

2.fxe3, the f2-pawn suddenly becomes a key player, and the fl-

Rook sits on a nice half-open file. It should be clear that, at times, courting a doubled pawn in the opening can be a very sensible thing to do. Yes, doubled pawns can be weaknesses, but they can also give you a grip on several important squares and create open files that catapult your Rooks into the fight.

Summary of Imbalances and Ideas [diagram (160)] > At the moment White's cl-Bishop is less active than Black's on c5 even though Black's c5-Bishop is thought to be a "bad" Bishop while White's cl-Bishop is thought to be "good." > Always try and trade your less active pieces for the opponent's active ones. > White's Rook on fl has no open files to use. > Black has solid control over both d4 and f4. > It's clear that l.Be3 addresses the points just listed. White offers a swap and actually hopes for l...Bxe3 since 2.fxe3 not only deprives Black use of d4 and f4, but it also opens up the f-file for White's Rook. Problem 19 True or false: In the Silman thinking system, the idea of the opening is to develop your pieces as quickly as possible. d False! It's been said that no development is better than a bad development. Rushing to get your pieces out without knowing what's going on is a sure recipe for disaster. The real idea behind the opening is to create an imbalance (Bishop versus Knight, giving your opponent a weak pawn, gaining space, etc.) and then to develop your forces around this difference. For example, as Black you can often create a Knight versus Bishop situation by playing ...Bg4xf3 or ...Bb4xc3< But will your Knight prove better than his Bishop? Who knows! Instead of ask- ing this question and hoping for a positive answer, it's your re- sponsibility to create the answer by setting your pawns and pieces up in such a way that the whole position highlights the advan- tages of a Knight over a Bishop.

5.Nf3 Nc6 6.Bd3 Bxc3+ 7.bxc3 d6 8.e4, Black plays 8...e5. What is his

strategic justification for playing in this way? (161) White to move. Black's whole opening concept revolves around the battle be- tween White's two Bishops and Black's Bishop and Knight. By playing ...e5, Black stops White from ripping the center open with an eventual e4-e5 because an open center would favor White's Bishops. He also freezes the White e-pawn and thus makes the d3-Bishop inactive, opens up the c8-h3 diagonal for the c8-Bishop, and welcomes 9.d5 Ne7 when the closed center should prove favorable to Black's Knights. Note how Black doubled White's pawns by 6...Bxc3+, giving White the two Bishops but destroying the flexibility of White's pawn formation, and immediately set about creating a closed, Knight-friendly environment by ...d6 and ...e5. When you create an imbalance, make sure you do everything possible to steer it in a direction that will prove comfortable for your side.

White has a lead in development and control over the e5-square. The action is too sharp for White to make effective use of e5 right away, so that leaves him trying to get some mileage from his lead in development. Though White would like to castle here, Black could then play 7...c4 8.Be2 Bxc3 9.bxc3 Ne4 when the c3-pawn is very weak.

Why shouldn't Black anticipate this and toss in

8...Bg4 while he has the chance?

(163) Black just played 8...Bg4. Is this a good idea? White to move. When you study an opening, you can't just memorize the moves and expect to play it properly. It's far more important to master the plans, ideas, and key positions. Then, even if your opponent plays a non-book move (and they always play a non-book move!), you'll still be able to find the correct reply, based on your under- standing of the position as a whole.

In the Ruy Lopez, Whites most basic ideas center around expansion in the middle via d2-d4, a queenside strike with a2- a4, and the repositioning of the bl -Knight via d2-fl-g3 where it defends e4, is out of the way of the rest of the army, and prepares to leap onto the tasty f5-square. Once you're aware of this Knight maneuver, the answer be- comes rather obvious: White just delays the d4 advance with d2- d3 and goes about his usual business in bringing the horse to g3:

9.d3 O-O 10.NM2 Na5 ll.Bc2 c5 12.Nfl Qc7 13.Ng3 Nc6 14.h3

Since Black doesn't want to play ...Bxf3 and hand White the two Bishops on a platter, the retreat of the Bishop to e6 or d7 is called for when the pin has been broken with gain of time.

(164) White to move. White has been allowed to build up a big center, and it's his responsibility to defend it with everything he's got. Remember that the player with a huge pawn center can often win the game simply by making the center invulnerable. Thus, moves like 7.Nc3 defending e4, followed by Be3 defending d4, Bd3 defending e4, and h3 strengthening d4 by stopping ...Bg4, immediately suggest themselves. Of course, it's Black's responsibility to attack the White center before it smothers him. Black will do this by ...Nf6, ...O-O, and Re8 For example 7.Nc3 Nf6 8.Be3 O-O 9-Bd3 Re8 10.h3 Bf5! forces White to push the e-pawn and create a weak square on d5.

Problem 24 After l.c4 g6 2.g3 f5 3-d4 B 7 4.Bg2 d6 5.d5 c5 would White do better to develop the gl-Knight to the center by 6.Nf3 or should he place it on the rim via 6,Nh3? (165) White to move. Solution 24 This position, from the game Taimanov-Tal, Moscow 1970, fea- tures one glaring weakness: the hole on e6. Black might try7 and mend this problem by ...e5 but by capturing en passant by dxe6, the d5~square would be permanently weak, and the d6-pawn would be permanently backward. In view of this, Taimanov cor- rectly tossed out the basic rule that states, "Never place a Knight on the rim." and instead played 6.Nh3 Now7 the Knight is head- ing for f4 where it not only eyes e6 but it also could leap into d5 in case of dxe6 en passant after Black's ...e5. Once again we can see that you should develop around the imbalances. Developing for the sake of development, especially if you haven't bothered figuring out the imbalances in that par- ticular position, isn't acceptable. Summary of Imbalances and Ideas [diagram (165)] > Black has a glaring hole on e6.

Problem 25 After l.e4 c6 (the Caro-Kann) 2.d4 d5 3 exd5 cxd5, commonly seen moves at the amateur level are 4.Nc3, 4.c4, and 4.Bd3. What one of these is simply incorrect? (166) White to move. The second choice, 4.c4, is known as the Panov-Botvinnik At- tack, and it's one of White's best lines against the Caro-Kann be- cause it puts pressure on Black's center by attacking d5. Note how White's Knight will fit quite nicely behind this pawn when both pawn and Knight join forces to hit d5. A line favored by amateurs everywhere is 4.Bd3. White places his Bishop on an active square, follows up with c2-c3 defending d4 and stopping a later ...Nb4, and aims for eventual kingside pressure. The final choice, 4.Nc3, is often seen in amateur chess but it's simply bad. Though White thinks he is developing, you should already know that development without a plan is often worse than no development at all. In the present case, White blocks his c-pawn and places his Knight on a road to nowhere. Think about

this. Just where is that Knight headed? The d5-pawn is as solid as a rock, especially after Black tosses in ...e7-e6. The e4- square is also off-limits. Jumping to a4 is moronic and Nb5 is nothing more than a hope and a prayer-Black can always kick it back with ...a7-a6. When you develop, make sure the move works towards a particular goal with the rest of your forces. Just tossing it out there with no rhyme or reason will get you nothing but trouble. Summary of Imbalances and Ideas [diagram (166)] > Unless White hits Black's d-pawn with c2-c4, it will turn into a rock after Black plays ...e7-e6.

The sharp c2-c4 usually leads to an isolated White d-pawn, while other moves lead to quieter play. > If White chooses to play quietly and just develop, he must do it in a way that allows all his pieces to work together towards a common goal. Something like Bd3, c2-c3, Bf4, and Nf3 aims all the pieces at Black's kingside. However, playing Nc3 doesn't do anything since d5 is solid and hopping to e4 isn't a very good idea. Problem 26 After l.e4 c5 2.c3, the popular Alapin Variation against the Sicilian Defense where White hopes to play d2-d4 with a full pawn center,

Grandmasters Hort and Lombardy. Why has 3.d3 been tossed into the rubbish bin?

162 I THE REASSESS YOUR CHESS WORKBOOK

As you might have guessed, the most obvious solution isn't cor- rect. I suspect that the vast majority of amateurs would play 3>.dxe4

4.dxe4 Qxdl+ here, not realizing that the position after 5.Kxdl is

extremely pleasant for White. Why? It turns out that the pawn structure gives White all the chances. Moves like a2-a4 followed by Nbl-d2-c4 leave White with a beautifully placed Knight. Then Be3, attacking c5, will leave Black in a bit of a quandary: defend- ing c5 with ...b7-b6 allows a well-timed a4-a5 hit, while ...e7-e6 creates a weakness on d6. The fact that Black has potential weak- nesses on c5, d5 and d6, while White doesn't have a weak spot in sight, gives the first player a nice edge that allows him to play for a win with virtually no chance for defeat. The reason 3-d3 isn't played is that Black can just develop normally with 3...Nc6 when White's rather passive opening can't be considered a success. Summary of Imbalances and Ideas [diagram (167)] > Black has more central space and doesn't have to do anything extreme. > Taking on e4 (3...dxe4 4.dxe4) leaves White with more central space.

Problem 27 After l.dT Nf6 2.c4 e6 3.Nf3, Black often plays 3...b6 (the Queen's Indian Defense). What's the logic behind this move? (168) White to move. White's 3-Nf3 didn't do anything to increase his control over the important e4-square. In fact, it actually blocked the possibility of a f2-f3 advance. Due to this, Black is playing logically by hasten- ing to aim more firepower at e4 with 3..b6. By placing his Bishop on b7, this piece suddenly becomes very active and, together with the f6-Knight, Black is able to lay claim to e4. It's clear that Black isn't just developing. He's getting his Bishop to an active post where it performs a particular function in unison with other members of its army.

Problem 28 After l.d4 d5 2.Nf3 Nf6 3.e3 e6 4.Nbd2 c5 5.c3 Nc6 6.Bd3 Be7 7.O-O, we reach a common position in the ever-popular (on the amateur level) Colle Opening. At this point, two moves that might be considered are

7...c4 and 7...cxd4. What do you think of these two possibilities?

(169) Black to move. Both are rather poor, though they're constantly seen in amateur events. Best is 7...O-O, getting the King to safety and keeping all options open. Compare the obviously useful 7...O-O with 7...c4, a move that takes the pressure off of d4 so Black can make a use- less attack against the d3-Bishop. After the Bishop comfortably drops back to c2, White is ready to play e3-e4 when all of his forces will soon aim at Black's kingside. If the pawn still stood on c5, Black might have managed some central counterplay-remem- ber that the best reaction to an attack on the wing is a counter attack in the center-but now White is very solid in the middle and can look forward to making real threats on the King's wing. Lesson: Don't make a one-move threat if it lessens your control over the center. Also dubious is 7...cxd4 because White is the one who makes gains after 8.exd4. Suddenly White's cl-Bishop has a free cl-h6 diagonal, while the fl -Rook has been handed the half-open e-file on a platter. Your moves are supposed to do nice things for your side.

It's clear that l...e6, locking in the c8- Bishop, and l...Bf5 have nothing to do with the fight for d4.

pawns-in fact, if Black's c-pawn still stood on c7, where it could defend d5 via ...c7-c6, White wouldn't even have consid- ered 4.Bxf6. The real point behind Bxf6 lies in the weakness of d5. By chopping off the Knight and pulling the e7-pawn to f6 (the doubled pawns aren't weak, but they are inflexible), White leaves Black in a position where he can't defend the d5-square with a pawn. This fits in perfectly with the opening view that I'm trying to teach: create an imbalance-in this case, Knight vs. Bishop, a more flex- ible pawn structure and a hole on d5-and then develop your pieces around these facts. Let's follow the game and see how White honed in on d5:

4...exf6 5.Nc3 Else Black would have played ...d7-d5. 5...Bg7

6.g3 Nc6 7.Bg2 And another piece takes aim at d5. So far White's

c4-pawn, c3-Knight and Bishop have joined forces to conquer that tasty square. 7...f5 8.e3 White avoids Nf3 because it wouldn't have anything to do with the game theme. 8...O-O 9-Nge2 and White's grip on d5 couldn't be broken.

Problem 31 (172) White to move. White's system has left him with a hole on d4. How serious is this? Also, would you label the White position flexible or inflexible?' The hole on d4 isn't serious at all, as long as White makes sure that a Black Knight can't take up permanent residence there. At the moment, ...Nd4 can always be met by Nxd4 when Black will have a doubled pawn on d4 and the hole will be filled. It's important to understand that a hole is only a serious prob- lem if an enemy piece can make use of it. The question pertaining to the flexibility of White's position is also rather easy to answer: White's game is very flexible! He can play for queenside expansion via b2-b4-b5, for a central break by d3-d4, or for a kingside attack by f2-f4-f5. Stepping beyond the parameters given in the problem, let's take this opportunity to address the often-discussed subject of memorization of variations versus understanding the ideas in your system. Some openings, of course, demand a lot of memorization due to their sharp, tactical nature. Most, however, are fairly easy to master by making a study of the system's ideas, structure, and tactical anomalies.

sible due to cxd5, forking Black's c6-Knight and e6-Bishop. ♦ Conversely, White might wish to avoid a quick Be3 because then Black's ...Nd4 becomes more of an issue since Nxd4 hangs a piece to ...exd4, forking the White pieces on c3 and e3. However, Be3 is fine if White plays Nd5 first, because then ...Nd4 can once again be safely met by Nxd4 since the c3-Knight has moved and can no longer be forked. ♦ If Black plays ...f7-f5, White will often prevent ...f5-f4 by Be3 followed by Qd2. The mixture of the Queen and Bishop hitting f4, plus the g3-pawn and the e2-Knight, make Black's hoped-for advance very difficult to achieve. ♦ White would love to meet ...f7-f5 with exf5. However, he will only play this move if Black isn't able to recapture with a Knight because a Knight on f5 attacks the e3-Bishop and brings another piece to bear on d4. Thus, the pawn tension will often remain intact until the e7-Knight moves away from e7. When that happens, White will play exf5 followed, if possible, by a central counter with d3-d4. I could go on and on, but this information, combined with the White plans listed earlier, is quite easy to learn and will arm any White player with enough ammo to make life difficult for his opponent. No matter what opening systems you play, make a concerted effort to garner this kind of information about them. Your results will improve dramatically if you do!

Moving on to the second diagram, we can't help but notice that we have the same basic structure as in the previous position, except now we have to determine where to place our pieces. How would you develop your forces if you had the Black position? Black's pawn chain of e7-d6-c5 points to the queenside, so he naturally wishes to increase his control of space in that sector. Since closed centers demand wing play with pawns, the correct

idea is ...a7-a6 followed by ...b7-b5. The only other plan for Black involves ...e7-e6 followed by ...exd5, opening up the e-file. Though the plan of advancing via ...b7-b5 holds true in both diagrams, the addition of pieces (the second diagram) makes the actualization of your idea harder to achieve. This means that you must use your army in such a way as to make your dreamed of pawn break a reality. Every7 developing move you make now takes on great importance because if you move it to a square where it has nothing to do with your proper plan, you're taking the first step towards defeat. In the second diagram, the first move that comes to mind is l...a6, but, aside from the fact that he doesn't even threaten ...b7- b5 since White has two pieces hitting b5 to Blacks one, White can further dampen Black's hopes with a2-a4. Most amateurs would put off their decision and simply de- velop with ...Nbd7. However, this doesn't have anything to do with Black's plan. Why not develop the Black pieces to squares where they can help make the ...b7-b5 advance a reality? A series of moves that nicely fits the bill is l...Na6 2.O-O Nc7 followed by7 ...a7-a6, ...Rb8 and, if necessary, ...Bd7.

Black has just played ...Bb7. Break this position down and explain the respective plans for both sides. An exact move or series of moves isn't important. Anand, after playing ...Bb7: "I knew the theory, but at this point I decided to ignore it and just look at the position. It seemed to me that Black could play very natural moves. The point of this one is to play ...e6 and completely destroy White's center. After the re- sulting exchanges, Black may be left with a weak pawn (for ex- ample, on e6) but it doesn't matter because Black has generated so much active play for his pieces." White has claimed quite of bit of central space but he paid a price for this: he's behind in development and his King is still in the center. To take advantage of these facts, Black needs to blast open the center and try to scare up some threats against White's centralized King. By playing dynamically and tossing in ...e7-e6 as quickly as possible, Black intends to activate his pieces and get something going before White can get his King to safety and defend his center. After l.Qd2 Nf5 2.Bh2 dxe5 3.fxe5 e6! 4.O-O-O (4.d6 Nd7 leaves e5 in a state of collapse) 4...exd5 5.Nxd5 Nc6 (with the threat of ...Ncd4), Black achieved an excellent position. The lesson here is simple: When you own a big center, make it indestructible. If you're opponent has a large center, do every- thing you can to chop it down.

White has tried many moves here: 9.e4, gaining central space, and

9.b3, preparing to fianchetto the cl-Bishop and also giving White the

chance to meet ...dxc4 with bxc4, both make sense. How would you judge the aggressive 9.c5? (176) White to move. At one time this move would have been the object of derision; White makes a one-move threat that's easily dealt with and, by

174 / THE REASSESS YOUR CHESS WORKBOOK

doing so, takes all the pressure off the Black d5-pawn. Today, it's a respected alternative to the more pedestrian 9.e4 and 9.b3. Of course, White knows that Black will safely pull his Bishop back to c7. The real reasons for c5 will be clear after another couple of moves: 9...Bc7 10.e4 White is the first to grab the cen- ter. Passive development by 10.Bd2 e5 would have been a plea- sure for Black. 10...dxe4 ll.Nxe4 and now we've reached a formation that appears to be good for Black, since the d5-square is firmly in his hands. The reason White went into this via 9.c5 is that he feels his control over e5 and d6 outweigh the weakness of d5. Also note that 9.c5 stopped Black's normal freeing maneuver ...b7-b6 followed by ...c6-c5. One more point: though the d4-pawn is backward, a pawn is only weak if the enemy is able to attack it. Black's lack of space and passive pieces can't prove the weakness of d4. Indeed, the d4-pawn is a tower of strength since it defends c5 and clamps down on the critically important e5-square!

Problem 35 This bare bones illustration of a Hedgehog structure, typically found in the English Opening and the Sicilian, allows us to illustrate Black's two main plans. Do you know them? Black can make use of the possible pawn breaks ...b5 and ...d5. If Black plays l...b5, he has suddenly equalized the space in that sector. 2.cxb5 axb5 would give Black a queenside space edge. If White didn't take on b5, Black would then grab more territory by

2...b4. Or, if he wanted to give White a pawn weakness, he could

play the simple 2...bxc4 and after 3-bxc4 the White c-pawn is isolated. Black can also challenge White's supremacy in the center with ...d6-d5 (of course, this will be backed up by a myriad of pieces) when Black's forces usually burst out of their confinement and become very active. Summary of Imbalances and Ideas [diagram (177)] > Black's d-pawn is backward and is vulnerable to attack by White's Rooks and White's dark-squared Bishop. When White achieves this structure, he would love to tie Black down to the defense of this pawn. Easier said than done! > Usually the d-pawn is well defended by Black's dark-squared Bishop and a host of other pieces (Queen, Rook, and even Knight).

This move was intended to be the start of major offen- sive against White's dark-squares on e5 and f4, thereby justifying the offside position of the Knight on h5. You didn't think Black played 10...Nh5 just to make a one-move attack against White's Bishop, did you? This kind of plan is commonly seen in modern openings. In fact, in his zeal to control f4, Black might even toss in ...Qf6, ...Be5, and ...g7-g5.

SOLUTIOXS / THE OPENING I 177

Unfortunately for Karpov, even the deepest positional ideas need to be supported by tactical realities. In this case, the Bishop on d6 and the Knight are both unprotected. Christiansen took advantage of this by moving his Queen back to dl, winning a piece, whereupon Karpov promptly resigned! I found it interesting to see a well-known chess curmudgeon (probably in the 2100 range, though he considers himself a grand- master!) write that ll...Bd6 was imbecilic because it blocked the d-pawn. Most players are so stuck in convention that they can't stand seeing a move that steps away from well-trodden paths. Even after I wrote to him and pointed out all the good that ...Bd6 was intended to do, he still held on to his opinion and wrote back, "It blocks the d-pawn, therefore it can't be good!" Remember that a mastery of typical patterns is highly recom- mended-in fact, it's crucial! It's a tool that will help you recog- nize previously seen situations and recall what other players did to solve the position's problems.

Problem 37 (179) Zukertort-Steinitz, London 1872. Black to move. What would you do in this position? The center is fairly closed so both sides will pursue pawn breaks on the wings. White will try for b2-b4 and/or f2-f4 while Black will eventually play for a ...f7-f5 advance. However, keeping an eye on the key central squares d5 and d4 will also be a priority. At the moment, Black has two Bishops, but the Bishop on g7 is blocked and bad. Black would also like to castle but he can't do this due to Bxh6. How will he finish his development? The an- swer is surprising: he doesn't bother! l...Ng8! Instead of developing a piece, Black actually undevelops his Knight! How can such a move be explained?. Quite simply! The idea is that the Knight was not really doing much on f6. The d5 and g4 squares were not available to it, d7 is a road to nowhere and h5 sticks it on the side of the board. Since Black was not happy with his Knight's placement, he decides to swing it around to c6 via e7 where it eyes both b4 and d4, frees the f7-pawn, and plays a much more important role in the center. Some of you may be asking, "How can Black afford this obvi- ous waste of time?" The answer should be easy to understand: If the position were open, this maneuver by the Knight would not be a good idea because time becomes very important in wide- open positions. However, in this case the center is semi-closed, making quick development less important, so a bit of lengthy

Don't allow an imbalance to be created if you think it will be to your opponent's advantage. Name the seven main imbalances. Superior minor piece; pawn structure; space; ma- terial; control of a key file or square; lead in develop- ment; initiative.

moves are the moves that lead to your fantasy position. Note that calculation is the last thing you do. What is a plan? Making positive use of the existing characteristics of a position. Note: you don't do what you want to do, you do what the position needs. There is often a big difference between these two things. What is the difference between a static and dynamic advan- tage or imbalance? A static imbalance is a long-term plus, usually highly positional in nature. A dynamic imbalance is short-term and often tactical in nature. What is the difference between a good and bad Bishop? A good Bishop isn't blocked by its own pawns. A bad Bishop is blocked by center pawns standing on its own color. Can an active Bishop also be bad? Yes, an active Bishop can also be a bad Bishop. In general, toss terms like "good" and "bad" out the window. The only thing that should concern you is the following question: "Is your Bishop doing a useful job?" If not, find a way to get it into the game! What are the three cures for a bad Bishop? Trade it off for a piece of equal (or superior!) value; get your pawns off of the color of the Bishop; get your Bishop outside the pawn chain.

If your opponent has two Bishops, what should you do? Close the position and turn the two Bishops into a liability; trade one off and leave him with only one Bishop. Why are two Bishops usually superior to two Knights? A Bishop's weakness is its inability to control squares of both colors. A Knight doesn't have the mobility of a Bishop, but it can ultimately land on every square on the board. Two Bishops comple- ment each other by covering both white and black squares. Two Knights can get in each others' way. Such Knights often don't work wTell together. WTSg Why is extra territory a good thing? The side with less space often has trouble finding active squares for his pieces. Top players covet spatial gains because they hope to squeeze their opponent to death within the confines of his cramped position. Ht What should the side with less space do to make the situation more acceptable? Trade off as many pieces as possible. This will give your remain- ing pieces more room to move about in. Why is a full pawn center a good thing to have? It gives its owner more space, and it restricts the movement of the enemy pieces. How can a player make use of a full pawn center? If you can make it indestructible, the opponent won't be able to create any counterplay and will likely perish due to his lack of space. What must you do if your opponent creates a full pawn center? You must prove that it's a weakness. Attack it for all your worth!

Are doubled pawns always bad? If not, what are their good points? Doubled pawns are often good because they give their owners use of a half-open or open file and also can offer extra control over important squares. • j'OKtV How does one make use of an isolated d-pawn and how does one play against it? The isolated d-pawn (from White's perspective) gives its owner use of the e5-square, which can be used as a fine home for a Knight, and a central space advantage. White will use these things to create threats against the enemy King. Black will fight to control the square in front of the d-pawn on d5. Then he will strive to trade all the minor pieces, effectively ending White's attack. Once this is done, Black can place a Rook on d5 and another heavy piece on d7 or d8, doubling against the d4-pawn. A timely ...c6-c5 or ...e6-e5 makes use of a probable pin along the d-file to force the win of the besieged pawn. In general, White will want to retain Queens early in the game, highlighting his attacking chances. However, if too many minor pieces get exchanged, White will want to trade off the Queens. This allows his King to safely come to the center and defend d4. He might also want to trade off the Rooks (if his attacking chances vanish) because without the Rooks, Black won't be able to put an optimal amount of pressure on d4. Do Rooks always stand well on open files? No. The open file is unimportant if you can't use it to penetrate into the enemy position. Place your Rooks on an open file if penetration points exist on it, or if you stop your opponent from taking control of it and ultimately penetrating into your position. When you triple on an open file with two Rooks and a Queen which takes up the rear, what is this called? Alekhine's Gun.

Problem 39 A systematic pawn advance designed to knock aside the opponent's pawn fortifications is known as a pawn break. Name some advantages that this kind of pawn advance might bring. Pawn breaks serve the following purposes: ♦ An advance of pawns gains space. ♦ A pawn advance can open files for your Rooks. ♦ A pawn advance can open diagonals for your Bishops.

The center pawns in a closed position limit the activity of both side's armies. The Rooks in particular have trouble finding a way to join in the battle.

(180) In this bare bones diagram, Black's pawn chain on c7-d6-e5 aims at the kingside, so Black is more or less obliged to play on that side of the board with By bringing a pawn up to join with his lead e-pawn, Black creates some influence on d4, e4, f4 and g4. Now he obviously owns more territory on the kingside than his opponent does. His pieces (in a normal situation, both sides would own a whole armada of men) suddenly have more room to maneuver in that sector of the board, and the Rook on f8-dead to the world when the pawn stood on f7-experiences feelings of empowerment now that the pawn has expanded its horizons to f5. Using this same logic, White seeks a c4-c5 advance, when his command of queenside space would demand respect, and the cl -Rook is suddenly in possession of an open file because White can open up that file with cxd6 whenever he wishes. In the game Fischer-U.Andersson, Siegen 1970, White played l.Khl Qd7 2.Rgl Rad8 3.Ne4 Qf7 4.g4. Odd-looking moves to be sure, but in

What is the point of the plans chosen by both great players, and was Fischer emulating Morphy?

The only way Black can make a challenge for the e4-square is to play an eventual ...f6-f5. However, this would open up the g- file and allow the White Rooks to come crashing in. In other words. Fischer s doubling of Rooks is a prophylactic maneuver designed to prevent Black from ever playing ...f6-f5.

However, though the examples are visually the same, the real point behind the plans chosen by Fischer and Morphy are actually quite different! In the Fischer game, he played the g4 advance in an effort to create an artificial support point on e4 for his Knight. In the Morphy game, the e5- support point already existed, and ...g7-g5 was played solely with mate in mind. Three things I'd like you to keep in mind from this problem: ♦ The ability to create an artificial support point should be a basic part of everyone's game. ♦ A kingside pawn advance doesn't necessarily mean that you are playing for mate. Indeed, sometimes a massive buildup of kingside pieces is more prophy- lactic than aggressive.

Problem 43 (184) G.Kamsky-M.Adams, London 1989. Black to play. Black can make use of a thematic idea. It won't sit around forever, so you better take notice and make a grab for the brass ring. In this kind of position, Black's play comes on the queenside while White's is clearly on the kingside. In general, you want to play where your space lies, and you shouldn't allow yourself to get distracted and lose sight of your correct plan. However, sometimes opportunity knocks and allows you to stop your opponent's play before it gets started. Care must be taken, though, to avoid falling into the trap of reacting to the other guy's plans and, as a result, failing to further your own. In the present case, Black is able to end White's kingside ideas per- manently, so the time taken to do so is very well spent. I...h5 Black realizes that if he can close up the kingside, he wall have a free hand on the other side of the board. The point of ...h5 is that 2,h3 isn't possible due to 2,..hxg4, when the pin on the h- file leads to material gain for Black. This means that White is left with either 2.gxh5, when 2...Rxh5 leaves White with many weak- nesses on the kingside, or 2.g5, as seen in the actual game.

What's the best way to make use of these plusses? Does White actually have the better game?

SOLUTIONS / THE MIDDLEGAME / 195

Soltrtwft44 • .. This position is easy to assess incorrectly. Yes, White does indeed have pressure against d5 and e6-though saying a square is weak- ened and finding a way to actually take advantage of it are often two different things-and also retains possibilities of playing c2- c4. These things are so "obvious" that no less a player than Bronstein completely mishandled the Black side while Adams felt he had good chances for a slight plus here. It's interesting to note that IM John Watson, who is very famil- iar with this type of French Defense pawn structure, took one glance and claimed an edge for Black! His opinion forces us to look at the good things in Black's camp (tactically and strategi- cally). Then a different picture begins to emerge: the second player has pressure against d4, c2, and d3. In some lines, h2 can also come under fire. These facts allow Black to generate consider- able counterplay. That game continued: l.Nh5 This prepares to swing the Knight to f4 where it hits the tar- gets on e6 and d5. l...Bxh5 2.Bxh5 gives White the two Bishops and leaves Black weak on the light-squares. You see, White isn't trying for a knockout. He is quite happy to quietly add new ad- vantages to his list. Since l...Qd7 18.N5f4 Bf7 19.Bg4 f5 2O.Bf3 leaves a new hole on e5 that a White Knight would love to dive into via Ne5, one could easily be led to believe that White is developing a nice initiative. Though Adams wasn't completely sure that he had a real ad- vantage here, he was quite high on this move, giving it an excla- mation point. However, deeper invesitgation leaves me thinking that l.Nh5 is actually an error, and that White should have played 1x4!, making the "target" on c2 into a dynamic unit, when l...Rc8 2x5! bxc5 3-dxc5 might be a bit better for the first player since the b2-Bishop has suddenly sprung to life. l...Nb4 Adams points out that l...Bf7 2,N5f4 Re8 might have been best, though this seems a bit passive to me. Actually, it's not clear if

Normally Black would not play a move like ...a7-a5 because it leaves him with a backward pawn on b6. However, once we give in to reality-which is that Black will end up with a weak pawn anyway due to White's plan of a4-a5xb6-we find that Black's l...a5 is actually quite logical since now White will be left with a weakness on a4. For those that still have doubts about l...a5, just do the math: If White gets to play a4-a5 followed by axb6, Black will have a weakness on b6 while White's potentially weak a-pawn will be gone.

Problem 50 (191) White to move. Black threatens to chop off White's Bishop on e>. How would you deal with this obvious but bothersome fact? SolutionSO Structurally White has a problem on the c-file, since he has a backward pawn there. Black also has a backward pawn on e6, but he is trying to get rid of White's e5-Bishop so a later ...e6-e5 will give him a strong center. You should also have noticed that Black's King is still in the center, so this, combined with White's long-term problems on c3, forces him to seek dynamic play. In general, you will either have to choose between quick play based on dynamics, or slow play based on statics. Since l.f4 is impossible due to the pin along the gl-a7 diago- nal, and since a Queen exchange after l.Qd4 fails to offer White anything because White's pawns on d4 and b4 will come under pressure after l...Qxd4 2.cxd4 Ne7, the first player is forced to find something with a touch of imagination. Bishop retreats are all lame: l.Bf4 and l.Bg3 are both com- fortably met by l...Ne7, while l.Bd4 Bxd4 2.Qxd4 Qxd4 3.cxd4 Rc8 4.Na3 Ne7 also gives Black his share of targets to strike at.

The first is l.Bd3, freeing the dl-h5 diagonal and indirectly de- fending the attacked Bishop. Now l...Bxe5 2.Qh5+ Ke7 3.Qxe5 Nf6 leads to an unexplored position with chances for both sides.

By trading the al-Rook, which isn't doing anything to enhance White's con- trol over f5, for the f4-Rook, which is defending that square. White, in effect, allows the al-Rook to enter the fight against f5. This shows why the Indian Grandmaster has been the World's number two for several years now. Anand points out that neither l.Bf5 Rf8 2.Be6+ Kh8 nor l.g3 Rf6 2.Bf5 Raf8 gives White much.

Solution 56 l...Ne6? Returning to our question of "What wonderful thing does this move do for my position?" we can see that Black has failed to live up to expectations. The Knight move is passive, places the horse on a square without a future (it can't jump to d4, f4 or c5) and lets White trade Bishops on the f3-b7 diagonal. Better was

the natural l.,.Ne4. This move gains time by attacking the White Queen, keeps the Knight active and blocks the b7-f3 diagonal, thus preventing a Bishop exchange and the subsequent weaken- ing of d5.

2.Qd3

In contrast to Black's last retreat, White's move is easy to un- derstand: he gets his Queen off the dangerous c-file, takes aim at d6 and eyes the light squares d5 and e4. That's a lot of good stuff with no negative baggage.

This trades off Black's active Bishop and clamps down on the weakened d5-square by getting rid of one of Black's main d5 defenders.

Second, the Black Bishop is the d5-square's main defender; once the Bishops are swapped off, the d5- square will most likely turn into a home for a White piece. Problem 57 (198) Anand-Inkiov, Calcutta 1986. White to move. While there's no doubt that White has the better game, turning this into something concrete is quite another matter. If you had to choose be- tween l.c3, l.Nec5, l.Nbc5, l.Nxf6+, l.Bxf6, or l.c4, what would you pick? In a way, I think this solution will come easier to a weaker player than to an expert or master. Why? Because, from a purely static viewpoint, the correct idea doesn't make positional sense. The most important thing to realize is that White has a significant lead in development. If he wants to make use of it,

SOLUTIONS / THE MIDDLEGAME / 215

he has to play very actively and bring the battle to his oppo- nent immediately. I.c3 looks nice, but it doesn't increase the pressure and thus allows Black to complete his development by l...Bd7. Both l.Nec5 and l.Nbc5 get nowhere fast after l...b6. l.Nxf6+ Nxf6 2.Rxd8+ Bxd8 3.Rdl Be7 still favors White-his pieces are far more active than Black's-but not nearly as much as in the actual game. l.Bxf6 also makes Black happy since exchanges tend to make the side with less space easier to handle.

This move creates a gaping hole on b4, something that stron- ger players try7 very hard to avoid. However, in this case White's advantage was based on his lead in development, and the only way to make use of it was to chase the d5-Knight away and open up the d-file. At times one must give something up (the b4-square) in order to achieve a more important goal.

Problem 59 This position doesn't appear to be very exciting. Will it be a draw, or does White have a way to generate some play? Solution 59 GM Larry Christiansen once told me the difference between IMs and GMs wasn't opening knowledge or strategic understanding, it was tactics. He insisted that GMs simply saw more than other players. Though interesting, this is hardly a revelation. It has always been apparent that masters see more than experts, experts see more than class "A's (1800-1999)," and down the list we go-one fish always being bigger and meaner than the fish below it. Sadly, it is all too easy to state the importance of tactics, and it is all too difficult to actually improve in this area. Books like Winning Chess Tactics by Seirawan, Chess Tactics For Advanced Players by Averbach, The Art of Attack in Chess by Vukovic and Think Like a Grandmaster by Kotov can be very helpful. As nice as all these products may be, most players simply don't have the time for intense study (what good is a book if you never look at it?). Isn't there a simple rule or point of reference that would allow the amateur to increase his tactical awareness? Actually, there is! Almost all combinations are made possible by an undefended or inadequately guarded piece. This means that whenever you see a piece that is "loose," perk up and look for a trick to take advantage of it. How can we use this information in regard to the diagramed position? Let's take a look: If Black can get his Knight to the dominating d5-square, he'll stand very well. White can bail out

SOLUTIONS / THE MIDDLEGAME / 219

and make a draw with the spineless l.Bxc7, but the undefended state of the c8-Rook (see how that key tactical device jumps at you!) allows White to virtually force a win with l.Rcl!, creating a devastating pin on the c-file. The Knight can't move due to Rxc8 and the Rook can't move since that would hang the Knight. After l...Qb7 Giving some support to c8 and once again threatening ...Nd5. 2.Qc4 the Knight is threatened a third time and is frozen into place due to the enhanced pressure on the c-file.

Problem 60 (201) Gligoric-Smyslov, Yugoslavia vs. USSR 1959. Black to move. This position is filled with imbalances. How would you rate Black's chances? What should he do? If we were to make a traditional judgment based on factors like passed pawns (White has connected passed pawns on d4 and e5) and pawn islands (Black has three islands to White's two),

220 / THE REASSESS YOUR CHESS WORKBOOK

then we would have to say that White stands better. However, the opposite is actually the case. Black is the one who is in charge here! How did I reach such a conclusion? That's simple: it's not what you have, it's what the things you have are doing. In the present case, White's connected passed pawns are firmly blocked. In fact, the pawns on d4 and e5 have handed the d5- square to Black's Knight where it attacks the White pawns on c3 and f4, and the Black Bishop on a8 is eating through the wide- open a8-hl diagonal. Compare these active Black pieces to White's: The cl-Bishop is blocked by the f4-pawn. The c2-Bishop is blocked by Black's pawn on f5. The White Knight is blocked by its pawns on c3, d4 and f4. At the moment, Black's pawn on a5 is threatened and there- fore must be defended. He must also find some way to increase the pressure against the targets on c3 and/or f4. In this light, Black's first move makes a good deal of sense: l...Rb3! This Exchange sacrifice, a purely positional sacrifice designed to highlight the flaws in White's game, defends a5 with the Queen and creates an immediate attack against c3-

2.Bxb3 cxb3

What has Black gained from his sacrifice? He has strong pres- sure against c3, the scope of his Queen has been enhanced with the opening of the c-file, and his c4-pawn has turned into a pow- erful passed pawn on b3.

3.Ra4 BfB!?

Seemingly hasty is 3-..Nxc3 4.Nxc3 Qxc3 since White can exchange his weak c3-pawn for Black's potentially powerful passed pawn on a5 (it also trades the magnificent Knight on d5 for the dead beast on e2) by 5.Bd2. However, this turns out to be very favorable for Black after 5...Qd3! 6.Bxa5 Rc8 7.Bd2 b2 8.Rb4 Rc2 9-Rb8+ Bf8 lO.Rdl Bf3 11.e6 Kg7.

SOLUTIONS / THE MIDDLEGAME / 221

This is far from clear, though, since 6,Rb5 is not easy to crack. Also note that 4.c4 Nb4 is met by 5.d5! Qxc4 6.d6 with a complete mess.

4...Ne3!

This leads to a rush of tactics after 5.Qxe3 Qc6 6.d5 Qxa4 7.e6 when 7...Bxd5 is met by 8.c4! with chances on the b2-h8 diago- nal. One gets the impression that Black must be winning some- where, but White should probably have gone for the gusto and given this a try.

The real point of 4...Ne3: Black defends a5 and starts to chip away at the blockade on b2. When you have a passed pawn, do everything you can to destroy the enemy pieces that block it.

Problem 61 (202) Joseph (1699)-Rice (1946), Los Angeles 1999. White to move. White has just blundered and is now a pawn down with little, if any- thing, to show for it. Should he just throw his arms in the air and give up, should he slap his opponent's face and demand that a draw be agreed upon, should he kick the pieces across the room to show his displeasure (I've seen grandmasters use this trick on more than one occasion!), or is there a way to put up real (legal) resistance? Personally I'd do something to scare my opponent (why not make use of my sumo-like size?) and then demand that a draw be agreed upon (after carefully noting that the director was nowhere in sight!); but for those with morals I suppose that an actual move is called for. We all blunder, and after doing so it's important to get up from the board, time permitting, and clear your head -nothing good can happen if you're still in the midst of an emotional back- lash. Forget about the earlier, happier, position and treat this new situation as a challenge. Hunker down, get tough, and insist on finding a way to put up a long, grueling resistance!

SOLUTIONS / THE MIDDLEGAME / 223

In the actual game White decided to retain his two Bishops by l.Bd2, not appreciating that Black's Knight is stronger than either White Bishop! The finish isn't a happy memory for Mr. Joseph: l...Bf6 2. Radi Rfe8 3-Be3 Bxb2 4.Bxa7 Nc3! 5.Bb6 Nxdl 6.Rxdl Qxdl+ 7.Bxdl Rel mate. After the game, Mr. Rice recommended l.Bxe7 Nxe7 2.Qe3, hitting both e7 and a7. Unfortunately, 2...Qd3! leaves White a pawn down for absolutely nothing. What I found interesting about this position is that neither player paid attention to the possibility of creating a Bishop of opposite color scenario by l.Bxd5! Bxg5 2.Ba2. Why is this im- portant? Bishops of opposite colors often give the defending side serious drawing chances because you can defend squares that the enemy Bishop can't attack, and attack squares/pawns that the enemy Bishop can't defend. Suddenly, White isn't necessarily los- ing in both the middlegame and the endgame. Now he can trade the Queens and Rooks (the more trades the better, since this cuts down on Black's attacking potential) in the hope of reaching vari- ous pawn-down drawn positions. Take the following position as an example: Though White is a solid pawn down, the position is a dead draw. White's Bishop is stopping Black's majority in its tracks, and the White Bishop is also eyeing Black's pawns on the kingside. From now on, when all seems grim and Ghostbusters won't get the job done, try to create an opposite-colored Bishop situ- ation and then hold on for dear life!

Problem 63 (205) Goldberg-Royal, Los Angeles 1996. White to move. Consider the following possibilities: l.Nxc6, l.Nxg4, l.f4, l.Bb5, l.Qa4, l.h3. Which one of these moves is best? The straightforward l.Bb5 is adequately answered by l...Rc8, when 2.Qa4 cxd4 3exd4 Qb6 is okay for Black. The silly l.h3 is nothing more than an obvious and useless one-move attack against g4. After l...Bh5 or l...Bf5, White has forced the Bishop to move to a safer square. In the actual game, White played l.Nxc6?, a bad move that helps Black strengthen his central position by bringing the side pawn on b7 to the more central c6-square (the c-pawns aren't really doubled since Black can play ...cxd4 at the right time and end the illusion). The two moves that deserve real attention are l.Nxg4 and l.Qa4. The calm, positional choice is l.Nxg4, which gives White the two Bishops. After l...Nxg4 2.Be2 Nf6 (2...Nxh2 3.g3 traps the greedy Knight) 3.O-O White will play to open up the position with a later e3-e4. If he succeeds in this, his Bishops will prove superior to the enemy Knights. However, White also should be tempted by the tactical 1-Qa4. Now l...Bd6 actually loses at once to 2.Nxg4 Nxg4 3.dxc5 with a double attack against g4, via the Queen, and d6. After l.Qa4, attempts to get the g4-Bishop to a safer port by l...Bf5 prove too slow: 2.Bb5 Rc8 3 Qxa7 (a common tactical device) and White has won a pawn.

That leaves l.Qa4 cxd4. The idea is that 2.exd4 lets Black play 2...Bd6 again, since now there are no discovered attacks via dxc5.

Problem 64 (206) Kasparov-L.Portisch, OHRA 1986. White to move. A common position has been reached. White usually tries to place pressure against the "hanging pawns" on c5 and d5. Black relies on his extra space (which those "weak" pawns supply) and his active pieces to turn the game in his favor. Kasparov wanted to make use of the f5- square via l.Nh4 with the intention of Nf5. Unfortunately, l...g5 picks up material. Since this doesn't work, White hatches an original idea designed to take away key queenside squares from the Black forces. Do you see what Kasparov found? I.a4l! This completely blew Portisch's mind! His comments (made live to an audience during actual play) in the tournament book show how shocked he was: "What move is this? He's just weak- ening his queenside. Is that really so? Oh no, he's starting to push the pawn to a5 where it will take away the important b6-square from my Knight." So Black figured out the first point of a2-a4: if the pawn can get to a5 it will severely restrict the movements of the Black Queen and make b6 inaccessible to the d7-Knight. Naturally, Portisch wanted to stop this from happening. See- ing that l...a5 would hand the b5-square to White on a platter, he decided to give his Queen the job of pawn-stopper. Unfortunately, he missed the second point of l.a4: if the Queen moves to a5 it will leave the e7-Bishop unprotected.

Problem 65 (207) White to move. Is l.a3 a good move? No, l.a3? a4! stops b2-b4 forever and guarantees that the c5-square will remain in Black's hands. This is a disaster for White since his play should come on the queenside. A successful b2-b4 advance, pushing the Knight back and gaining queenside space, is a virtual must for the first player. Due to this, White's correct first move is l.b3, and only then 2.a3 and 3.b4.

What thematic idea should White implement in this position? I.a4! is a typical device in this kind of position. Now Black can suffer several kinds of positional problems: l...bxa4 2.Bxa4 leaves the a6~pawn weak and the c4-square in White's hands. I...b4 hands over c4 immediately. l...Rb8 lets White take control of the a-file with axb5. Isn't it amazing how this little two square ad- vance of the a-pawn creates such disorder in the Black position?

Black has just captured White's Queen on d2 and expects to achieve a very comfortable position after l.Rxd2 Nxd5 2,exd5 Bd7. In that case, the d5-hole will be filled by a White pawn and the d6-pawn won't be backward any longer. The resultant position leaves White with no real chances on the queenside. However, Black will be able to generate some play on the kingside with a well-timed ...f7-f5 advance. To avoid this, White decided to chop on f6, keeping d5 open and the d6-pawn backward.

I...gxf6!l This ''ugly" move (Ivanchuk most likely expected something like l...Bxf6 2.Rxd2 Ke7 3h4 with a small plus thanks to his play on the kingside) freezes the White kingside pawns and allows Black to turn them into targets with ...h6-h5.

2.Rxd2 h5!

White's problem is that he can't hold his kingside structure together with h2-h3. As a result, his pawns on g4 and h2 will turn out to be long-term weaknesses. Believe it or not, White is now in serious trouble.

Another surprising decision. This Bishop was Black's main defender of d5 and f5, yet he rushes to exchange it for an inactive piece that hasn't even moved! Has Black gone mad? No, if we look past its apparent flaws, we will see that this move is, in fact, extremely logical. It turns out that White threatened to solidify his position with h3 followed by Rg3. Black had to stop this at any cost! By chop- ping off the fl-Bishop, White won't be able to prevent Black from planting his Rook on h3- Due to this, White's pawns on h2 and g4 will remain targets and Black will achieve the superior position. True, holes will be created on d5 and f5, but holes don't mean much if no enemy pieces can occupy them!

Paradoxical? Yes, but this does not mean that the old posi- tional rules have been suspended for the course of this game. Black's play depends on two things. First of all, his long-term aim is to exchange his d-pawn for White's e-pawn by ...d5 and to exchange his f6-pawn for White's g-pawn (either by ...f5 or by forcing White to play g5). Then he will be left with two con- nected central passed pawns, supported by his King, whereas White will have pawns on c2 and h2 that aren't going any- where. Secondly, he can only put his plan into action because he has the initiative, and especially as the Rook on h3 disrupts

Problem 70 (212) Nimzovich-Tartakower, Carlsbad 1929- White to move. White's enormous superiority is obvious. How would you continue if you were blessed with this position? Black is more or less helpless, so White shouldn't go all out for a "mate or nothing" scenario. Instead he should build up his attack while simultaneously improving the position of all of his pieces. l.Nhl! This excellent and very accurate move prepares Qh2 and also intends to improve the position of this Knight by Ng3, heading for both h5 and f5. Though l.Ndl, intending Ne3, was also good, why not increase your potential by giving your Knight two squares to drool over (f5 and h5) instead of just one (a Knight on e3 only eyes f5). Placing the Knight on g3 instead of e3 also allows White to bring the c3~Knight to e3, when both horses would be poised to leap into f5.

Nimzovich knows his opponent can't do anything, and he doesn't intend to allow Black even a glimpse of counterplay.

This important move needs to be discussed. Nimzovich was the first player to openly discuss the principle of two weak-

By not castling long, White shows his intention to expand on the queenside by b3, a3, and b4 (why place your King in an area that is about to be ripped open?). This, combined with a powerful kingside attack and Black's overall helplessness, as- sures White of eventual victory. After the further 5. .Rh8 6.Rh4 Qe8 7.Rgl BfB 8.Kg2 Nb7

Black's move is so natural that it should be so obvious to all tourna- ment players. What is it? Black's Bishop on g7 is aiming at the White King, but at the moment it is blocked by the c3-pawn.

List the imbalances and your interpretation of White's correct move. Black has a very bad Bishop on d7. Thanks to the closed nature of the position, White's Knights are the superior minor pieces here.

Why not play calmly and try to exploit the Knight versus Bishop advantage? I.b4! A great move that freezes Black's b-pawn, forcing it to remain on a light-square where it will forever block the Bishop. I.b4 also gives the White Knights potential support points on a5 and c5, not to mention the existing support point on d4. Anand's own words tell the story in a simple yet effective manner: "At first it seems that Black's Knight can reach a good square by ...Na4-c3, but in fact it is not very effective at c3 be- cause it lacks adequate support. By contrast, White's Knights, af- ter Nb3 and Nfd4, have well-supported and useful squares to land on at d4 and c5.

Whose position do you like and why? Shouldn't White stand better in this type of position? He has more territory- in the center and on the queenside, plus the Black pawn on d6 appears to be a target. This description of the position would be accurate if the Black pawn on d6 had to stay on that square forever. However, Black doesn't have to let White have his way. In fact, Black is dying to throw off his chains and challenge White for territorial rights with an eventual ...d6-d5. This would free both his Rooks, crack open the a8-hl diagonal for his light-squared Bishop, and get rid of the "weakness" on d6. He also has ...b6-b5 which would activate the c8-Rook and challenge White's queenside spatial dominance. l...Nh5! A tricky move that eyes the weakened g3 point and creates a pin on the al-h8 diagonal.

make sense, maybe some of them are bad, maybe all of them are suspect) and then tell me what you think of the final position. White is playing for queenside gains and for control over the f5- square. Black is trying to somehow get a kingside attack started. The way White ignores Black's illusory kingside threats and quietly builds up his own plusses is impressive.

1.b4

This move gains queenside space and shows complete dis- dain for anything that Black may conjure up.

1...h4

Black lashes out on the kingside and tries to put a scare into his opponent. This is the point where most amateurs (as White) would start to defend. To his credit, Piacenza doesn't even blink. It should be noted that 1..T5 would have turned out very nicely for White after 2.exf5 Bxf5 3-Bd3 when White gets to use the e4-square as a home for his Knight.

2.Be2

This move jumps on the fact that g4 is no longer defended by a pawn. White doesn't mind the doubled g-pawns because he sees that the g3-pawn keeps the enemy Knight out of f4 and h4. I love White's mentality: instead of seeing Black's kingside play as a threat, he is looking at it as a weakness!

In general, the side playing for a queenside attack gets endgame odds since his play is based on the accumulation of small fac- tors. The side playing for a kingside attack is usually in search of a knockout and, as a result, needs to retain the Queens (this acts as his big right hand). The following moves show just how bad the position is for the second player: 7.Qdl Kg7 8.Bxg4 Qg5 Black has placed all his hopes in this final attacking gesture. As usual, White just goes about his business and ignores him. 9.Bxc8 Qe3+ 10.Rf2 Raxc8 ll.Qf3 The double threat of 12.Qxe3 and 12.Qxf7+ forced a Queen exchange. White easily scored the full point.

How would you assess the situ- ation and what do you think Black's best plan is? (222) Though Black is down a piece for two pawns, she has excellent chances thanks to White's poor King position and the inactivity of White's hl-Rook and h3-Bishop. Being up material doesn't mean much if your pieces can't join in the battle, and White's unfortu- nate army isn't acting as a team at all.

Problem 81 (223) Tal-Gligoric, Candidates' Quarter Final Match 1968. Black to move. Things look bad for Black. White has more central space and is prepar- ing a central advance by Nf3 and e4-e5. White also has good chances against the Black King because all of White's pieces are aiming in that direction, while nothing much is happening on the queenside. To say that the queenside is equal and the center and kingside favor White, speaks for itself. What is Black going to do about this state of affairs? His Rook is under attack and a swap would give White control of the open b-file. l...Qc7!! This fine move gives up the Exchange for several positional plusses. By making this sacrifice, Black gives himself something to play with. Of course, he could have retained material equality by l...Rxbl, but then every advantage would have been on the opponent's side. No self-respecting grandmaster would accept such a dismal state of affairs! Never wait around so that you can die without a fight; insist on getting some play. Even if White is still better, at least Black now forces his opponent to play with great skill to prove it.

2.Bxb4 cxb4

In return for his modest material investment, Black has gained a nice majority of pawns on the queenside, fine squares on c5 and c3 for his Knights, increased control over many central dark- squares (thanks to the fact that White has lost his dark-squared Bishop), and pressure on the half open c-file against White's c4-pawn. That's a lot of stuff Black didn't have a moment ago!

Giving his f6-Knight more support. If Black could somehow gain permanent control over the e5-square (Knight on d7 and Bishop on f6, for example), he would actually stand better. Unfortunately, it is not so easy for the second player to get his kingside pieces to their best squares and this allows White a chance to make threats in the center.

4.Khl a5 5.Qd2!

White is clearly worse on the queenside so he begins to bring all his forces around to the center and the kingside. Note that Tai is not trying to rest on his materialistic laurels. Instead he goes all out to create his own chances elsewhere on the board.

White wants to retain this Bishop because it defends e4 and, once the e-pawn advances, will become a strong attacking piece that aims directly at the Black King.

He also has play against White's King (plans like ...a5 followed by ...b4 suggest themselves) and an active Bishop which can move to d5 and eye both sides of the board. How did Black manage to turn a seemingly bad position around? He fought to create some plusses of his own. He took the fight to his opponent and he refused to allow doubt to enter the equation. Simply put, Black had two goals: ♦ To cure the ills of his position, i.e., covering up the hole on e5, making e6 hard to reach, improving the position of his Knight, and playing to activate his Bishop. ♦ To make use of the plusses in his game so that pressure could be placed on White's poorly placed King. Black also has the ability to open the position up by ...a 5 followed with ...b4 and/or ...e6-e5. In the actual game, Black accepted White's verdict that he was worse. In our improved version we saw the second player rebelling at this pessimistic view. Often your position is as good as you think it is. It's far better to be deluded in a positive way by always claiming some sort of advantage than to bemoan your fate and lament the horrors that are in front of you.

Problem 85 (227) Piacenza-Lyles, Continental Open 1996 (two B players). White to move. We all make errors in chess. However, a logical move that turns out to be a tactical mistake or a simple case of flawed judgment are far cries from moves that do more for our opponents than for us. Self-destruc- tive ideas come up in almost every amateur game I have seen and, after lots of thinking, the closest thing to a cure I have found is the follow- ing: Whenever you are about to play a move in chess, always ask: "What wonderful thing does this move do for my position?" As simple as this may sound. I have never had a student who could follow this advice. WTiy? I honestly don't know. Perhaps the fire of battle blinds us to lessons of the past. Perhaps this verbal inquiry into a move's usefulness leaves a bad taste in one's mouth. In this game White, who was worried about ...exd4 with threats to his e-pawn, played l.d5, gaining central space. Was this a wise thing to do? What wonderful thing does this move do for White's position? White has a nice plus due to his spatial edge in the center, queenside possibilities with a later a2-a4-a5 and b2-b4, and long- term control over the f5-square. Black has just moved his Knight from d7 to f6 and now appears to be putting pressure on e4 with the "threat" of ..exd4. White bought into this lie and, fearing the pawn capture on e4, came up with what he thought was the perfect defense. I.d5?? First, it must be understood that Black really didn't threaten anything at all. Black's idea of l...exd4 could have been met with 2.Bxf4 or even 2.cxd4 when 2...Nxe4 3.Bxf4 wins a piece

SOLUTIONS / THE MIDDLEGAME / 267

for White and 2...Qxe4 3Qxe4 Nxe4 4.Bxf4 also leaves Black in a resignable position. So why is White stopping Black from losing the game? Always challenge the opponent s threats, and only re- act to them if you're 100% sure they deserve respect. If White really did want to defend his e-pawn, the most logi- cal choice would have been INgS If we ask what wonderful things l.Ng3 does for our position, we come up writh some solid answers: It brings the Knight into a more aggressive position; it takes aim at the f5-square; it firmly defends e4. Now let's ask the same question about l.d5- This unfortunate move stops ...exd4, but that capture wrould have been nice for White since it gives up the center after cxd4. So l.d5 stops Black from making a mistake. In other areas, l.d5 sinks even lower down the evolutionary ladder: it closes the center, which makes Black's kingside attack more believable since wing attacks only work if the center is closed or under the attacker's control, and it turns the active Bishop on c4 into a blocked, bad thing. So l.d5 gives us a bunch of negatives and, obviously, should have been avoided at all costs.

If this is true, White should defend e4 with a move that still tries to make use of his other plusses (Ng3, defending e4 and hitting f5 is simple and to the point). If it's an illusion, then White can do anything he wants.

How would you handle the Black position? Black's pieces are well placed, but there aren't any targets to strike at. White has doubled pawns and two Bishops. How can this information translate into a plan or move? The two main considerations are Black's lack of a target and White's doubled pawns. The doubled pawns in this case give the first player added control of the center and are a useful commod- ity. Thus, Black needs to create a target and chip away at that doubled wall of pawns. I...b5!

However, he shouldn't rush into this push until the time is right. ♦ A glaring weakness in the Black camp is the b5-pawn. White would like to attack it and tie Black's pieces down to its defense. White's Knight retreat, though odd looking, stops Black's ...Ng5 (White's Queen now hits that square) and prepares to swing the Knight around to c3 where it takes aim at Black's loose pawn on b5.

Though down a Queen for a Rook and minor piece, White enjoys a clear advantage. Black's King is in trouble, his pieces are tied up and useless, and the Knight on d6 and Rook on a8 are exceptionally powerful. In fact, together they are much stronger than Black's Queen. Most amateurs have real trouble coming to terms with the loss of their Queen. Even when they obtain a material plus for the Queen-Rook and two minor pieces or two Rooks-doubt con- tinues to plague them.

Moving a dynamically placed piece to a passive square can't be right (in fact, Black eventually won this game). All of White's army is well placed and primed for combat, so the time for deci- sive action has clearly come. Extremely tempting is 26.Be8, blocking the f8-Rook's defense of the c8-Bishop. 26...Bd7 27.Nc5!? Pointed out by Chris Brashers during a lecture I gave in Los Angeles. 27...Qxe5 28.

So far passivity has failed (26.Ra2), and a heavy-handed search for beauty (26.Be8) also didn't quite get the job done, though such measures are often just what the doctor ordered. Instead, it would appear that cold practicality is in order: 26.Ne8+ Rxe8

27...Qf8!.

In the end, let's follow the simple rule that states, "One must open up the position if the King is in the center." Thus, 26.c4! is White's best plan: 26...Bxf2+ (26,..Bd4 loses immediately to 27.Be8!)

Problem 95 (239) Karpov-Spassky, Leningrad 1974. White to play. How would you play this position? Be ready to discuss its secrets in detail. White has the two Bishops, though at the moment this doesn't appear to be worth much. White also has potential pressure down the f-file and he would like to eye Black's weak pawns on a5 and c6. Most important is the juicy c4-square, ready and waiting for White to occupy. The move that addresses most of these points is: l.Qfl! Aside from putting pressure on the f-file, White avoids the exchange of Queens because he sees that his Queen will ulti- mately be stronger than its opposite number. Why? Because the White Queen has a great home waiting on c4 where it eyes c6 and f7. The Black Queen does not have a square of equivalent strength. In general, trade your weakest pieces but make sure you re- tain the men that you feel will eventually be better than their enemy counterparts. It is also important to point out that the obvious and very tempting l.Rd2 is not so good because at the moment the f-file may be more important than the d-file. Note that there are no penetration points along the d-file: d4, d5, d6, d7 and d8 all being securely covered.

Problem 96 (240) Karpov-Spassky, Leningrad 1974. White to play. White has a clear advantage, but making this statement and improving your position are two very different things. In fact, its often in this kind of situation that one's edge, visually so clear, begins to evaporate with each and every move. What should White do to increase his superiority? All of White's pieces are doing a good job with the exception of his Knight, to which both b5 and d5 are inaccessible.

Problem 97 (241) Black to move. Black has a very comfortable Sicilian position and he can handle this situation in several different ways. There's one move that a good player would choose instantly. However, a less experienced player might never even consider it. Let's take a moment and discuss the gospel of point-count: When we learn to play chess we are told that pawns are worth one point, Bishops and Knights are worth three points, Rooks are worth five points, a Queen is worth nine points, and a King is priceless since its loss also means the loss of the game. These point-count comparisons are quite useful at first, but even- tually they can actually color our vision when it comes to what pieces are really worth in any given situation. Probably the most commonly seen argument with point-count tradition is the oft-employed Exchange sacrifice. Grandmasters seem to sacrifice Rooks for enemy Knights and Bishops all the time, but ordinary mortals usually get cold feet when it comes to giving up five points for a mere three. When I was a teenager in San Diego, I used to be amazed by the play of a gentleman who learned how to move the pieces at the age of 70 and thought that Bishops were better than Rooks. He would give up his Rooks at the first opportunity for enemy Bish- ops, and often win as a result! The fact that this guy could toss away material for no good reason and still retain a 1900 rating shows us that point-count is not a good master to follow blindly. If we are going to ignore the dictates of point-count on occa- sion, then what should we be looking for? Well, point-count is a

/ THE REASSESS YOL'R CHESS WORKBOOK

useful tool, but often the normal values of pieces are warped by positional or tactical considerations. All these must be taken into account before a decision of any kind is made. The position in the diagram shows a situation that begs for a very common Exchange sacrifice. A grandmaster wouldn't hesi- tate for a moment to play l."Rxc3! 2.bxc3 Nxe4 when 3-Qd4 is met by 3---d5 with ...Bf6 to follow. No calculation needed: he would just reach out and do it. For the Rook, he gets a well- placed Knight, a strong central pawn, and a clear structural ad- vantage. True, he's down four points to five, but it's not a mere count that interests a strong player. Instead, he wrants to gain as many advantages as possible-material is just one of many differ- ent plusses. In the present situation, White's tiny extra point can't make up for Black's many other favorable imbalances. Summary of Imbalances and Ideas [diagram (241)] > Black's position is very solid and he has some pressure against e4 and down the c-file. > An experienced player would instantly look at the consequences of ...Rxc3. > Don't worship at the feet of materialism. Other factors, like pawn structure and the activity of the pieces, must also be given full respect. Problem 98 (242) Steinitz-Chigorin, Havana Match 1892. White to play. White is much better, but it's very hard to break through and force a win. How would you handle this position?

SOLL'TIOXS / THE MIDDLEGAME / 2<S9

The position in diagram (242) is very good for White. He has more space, more active pieces, play against the hole on e5 and chances to pressure the Black pawns on a6 and c6. Black has just played ...Rb8. hoping to trade Rooks. This follows the rule that the side with less space should seek exchanges since that will give more room for his other pieces to move about in. White did not want to avoid the swap by moving his Rook off the b-file. Why turn the file over to Black? Instead, White played a move that increased all of his advantages in a striking way. l.Rb6! This powerful use of the support point on b6 attacks both a6 and c6 and sends the following message to Black: "If you want to take my Rook you will have to give me new, advanced squares for my pieces, a powerful passed pawn on b6 and increased pres- sure against your pawn on c6 and hole on e5." In other w ords, White decided that the two points (according to point-count. White will be losing five points for three) lost after l...Nxb6 would be more than compensated by all the positional plusses he gains. White is not playing for mate. He is not playing for material (of course, White would take a mate or free material if his opponent was kind enough to offer them). He is playing for the acquisition of several small gains that will eventually reap greater rewards. Let's see how this game went. l...Nxb6 2.cxb6! Breaking another rule by capturing away from the center (the beginner's books tell us to always capture towards the center)!

more moves. Why did Black lose so badly? Because the only attackable targets on the board were owned by Black, which means that White was attacking and Black was on the defensive. Also impor- tant was the fact that Black's Rook had no open files. A Rook is only better than a Bishop or a Knight if it can penetrate into the enemy position on an open file. If such a file does not exist then a well-placed Knight or Bishop can often run rings around the clumsy Rook. Never say that Rooks are better than Bishops or Knights. Ask, "Are Rooks better than Bishops or Knights in this particular position?"

This sacrifice of the Exchange destroys the White center and gives Black added control over the f5-squarc.

Because he achieves his strategic goal. He succeeds in destroying the White center. In other words, this sacrifice was not played with gross threats in mind. It was played so that Black's positional ideals could be achieved.

The Bishop was no longer doing anything on b4 so it takes up a new home on c5. Now the Black Queen is staring at b2, the d4-Knight is firmly defended and the line-up on the a7-gl diago- nal is making everything quiver in fear.

5.Rfl Bb5!

Always be on the lookout for ways to trade off your bad pieces for the enemy's good ones. This move gets rid of the awful Bishop on d7 for White's pride and joy on d3.

6.Bxb5 Qxb5 7.Kh3 Ne2 8.Ng2 Nf5

The f5-square has been beckoning this Knight for a long time. Notice how Black is playing quietly and slowly, showing no fear that White's extra Exchange will play a major role in the coming battle. Why is Black so confident? Because all his pieces are more active than their White counterparts, because White has weak pawns on f4 and h4 while Black has no weaknesses anywhere, and because the Black Knights are better than either White Rook.

9.Kh2 Neg3 10.Rf3 Ne4 ll.Qfl Qe8

Refusing to trade Queens and take some of the heat off the exposed White King. If your opponent's King is more exposed than yours is, keep the Queens on the board!

12.b4 Bd4 13.Rbl Qh5 14.Rbb3 Rc8

Black doesn't play 14...Nxh4 for*two reasons. First, why ex- change that beautiful Knight on f5 for White's pathetic one Qn g2? Second, 14...Nxh4 allows White to play 15.Rh3. Never enter com- plications when a simple build-up will ensure victory in a safe but sure manner. The logic behind 14...Rc8 is clear: All of Black's pieces are showing maximum activity except that f8-Rook. On c8 the Rook controls the open c-file and threatens to penetrate deep into the White camp. White is so helpless that he can't do any- thing to stop Black's intentions.

15.Be3 Rc2 16.Kgl Nxe3

Normally Black wouldn't dream of exchanging his super horse for the silly Bishop but this sets in motion a series of pins and forks that puts a permanent end to White's resistance. As strong as this turns out to be, the family fork with 16...Nd2! is even better.

This means that Black must start a fight now, before White's pieces reach the center. Problem 100 Some grandmasters pull madly on a locket of hair while pondering their moves. Others shake in their seats or contort their faces in fright- ful ways. Why are they doing this? Do they have lice? Are they terrified? Do they suffer from delirium tremens? Chess success depends on willpower, but few seem to really ap- preciate this important point. When I watch a grandmaster pulling on his nose while he agonizes over a move, I realize that he already knows what he wants to accomplish. His energy is being spent on the method of achieving his goal. To this end, he often won't move until he finds a way to make his desires turn into reality. Situations involving willpower come up all the time-your opponent tries some idea and you must either let him get away with it or (metaphorically!) slap him in the face and make him take a few steps back. The ability to spot a flaw in his concept, and the desire to impose your own set of views on the situation, is a large part of what makes up chess strength. Thus willpower- a mind that insists on achieving the goals it set-is a major part of every7 grandmaster's makeup.

SOLUTIONS / THE ENDGAME

Problem 101 (244) Milat-Silman, National Open 1998. Black to move. I had been in agony the whole game (White had missed at least one instant win), and the creation of various per- petual check themes was my last line of defense. After offering my opponent several bottles of free beer which he refused, seemingly intent on winning the game, we reached the position in the diagram. Black has a choice between two legal moves: l...Kd7 and l...Ke7. Is there any real difference between the two? If so, what? l...Ke7! This is a very important move, and it shows how selection between seemingly similar choices can have an enormous impact on a game's result. When faced with this kind of decision, you can't take it lightly. It's very7 important to hunker down and try and discern what the differences are, and how those differences will ultimately affect your chances. In this case, one of the moves draws, while the other simply7 loses.

296 / THE REASSESS YOUR CHESS WORKBOOK

The pawn endgame after l...Kd7?? 2.Qe6+! Qxe6 3.fxe6 is lost for Black because White recaptures with check (this is the differ- ence!). Then 3-..Kxe6 4.g4 gives Black a very inferior version of the actual game because his kingside majority would be crippled.

2.Qe6+!?

At the time I was positive that this allowed me to save myself, though much of that view was based on ignorance. I was more worried about 2.Qxh7+ Kd6 3Qb7 though I was pretty sure that 3 ..Qdl+ would give me sufficient play. I reasoned that my King was active, White's King was vulnerable, and the White Queen was out of play and unable to stop perpetual check. Whether this really drew didn't matter at the time, the game had been going on for hours and my old, exhausted brain was willing to grab hold of any happy result, real or imagined, that it saw.

2...Qxe6

3.fxe6 f5

My opponent's face fell when I blitzed out this move. He later admitted that he missed it. Now my kingside majority is mobile and it's also keeping his King at bay.

4.b3 Kxe6

5x3 I began to think that I might even have winning chances! At this point a well-known grandmaster happened to stroll by. He glanced at the position for a couple of minutes and walked away. Later he confided that he also thought that I was on top (two minutes isn't time enough for anyone to figure things out, but it does show that even a world class player won't find these positions easy). Now I began to think. I thought and thought and thought and became more and more depressed as the minutes ticked by. Fi- nally I convinced myself that I was lost. White can create an an- noying outside passed pawn on the queenside. True, Black's King is more active than White's but, during the game, I couldn't see how this was going to save me against best play! Cursing my luck, I struggled to find some saving scheme and finally came up with something. Notice that I didn't say "something good."

SOLUTIONS / THE ENDGAME / 297

5-..Ke5 At the time I thought this was very important. The idea is to meet 6.Ke3 with 6..T4+. Later I'll show that this check is a losing blunder. However, during the game I fully intended to play it! Embarrassing but true! 7.Kf3 (7.Kd3 Kd5 8.b4 c4+ 9Ke2 g4 cre- ates a drawing blockade. This is one of the important points of

5...Ke5) 7...Kf5 8.b4 g4+ 9-Ke2 Ke4 10.a5 bxa5 ll.bxa5 Kd5. I

really believed I was drawing here since 12.Kd3?? is met by 12...c4+. I happily rested in my fool's paradise until I got home. Setting up this position on a board, I immediately noticed that 12,c4+! wins: 12...Kc6 13.Kd3 Kb7 14.Ke4 f3 15.gxf3 gxf3 16.Kxf3 Ka6

17.Ke4 Kxa5 18.Ke5! Ka4 19-Kd6 Kb4 2O.Kd5 and Black is toast.

This classic situation is known as a Trebuchet! Fortunately, my opponent agreed with my early incorrect as- sessment and tossed out:

6.g3

Now the game was eventually agreed drawn due to a line I'd worked out when I played 5...Ke5: 6.g3 Kd5 7.Ke3 Kd6 8.Kd2 Kd5 9-Kc2 And not 9-Kd3?? c4+! when Black wins. 9 - Kd6 10.Kd3 Kd5 ll.b4 Kc6 12.Kc4 cxb4 13.cxb4 b5+! 14.axb5+ Kb6 15-Kd5 Kxb5 16.Ke5 f4 17.gxf4 gxf4 18.Kxf4 Kxb4 19<Kf5 Kc5 2O.Kf6 Kd6 21.Kg7 Ke7 22.Kxh7 Kf7 with a basic draw. At the time I was impressed with myself. As already pointed out, though, my elation turned to self-loathing when I returned home. It seemed (incorrectly, as it turns out) that I was indeed lost after 6.Ke3. In a way, I was lucky to have been deluded. Who knows what I would have done if I'd seen what was "really" going on? In this case, ignorance really was bliss. Now other voices started to join in on this King and pawn endgame debate. First IM Jack Peters offered up some new ideas from the diagrammed position:

298 / THE REASSESS YOUR CHESS WORKBOOK

(245) White to move and win. I have already pointed out that 10.a5 (10.bxc5 bxc5 11.c4 also does the trick) 10...bxa5 ll.bxa5 Kd5 12.c4+ wins for White, but Jack noted, quite correctly, that Black can put up a better but ultimately hopeless defense after 12...Kc6 13.Kd3 Kb7 14.Ke4 with, instead of my 14. "f3, 14...Ka6 15.Kxf4 Kxa5 16.Kxg4 Kb4 17.Kf3! Kxc4 18.g4 with four possibilities: ♦ 18...Kd5 19.g5 Ke6 20.g6, Queening. ♦ 18...Kb3 19.g5 c4 20.g6 c3 21.g7! when White Queens with check. ♦ 18...Kd3 19.g5 c4 20.g6 c3 21.gxh7 c2 22.h8=Q cl=Q

23.Qd8+ Kc2 24.Qc8+ Kbl 25.Qxcl+ Kxcl 26.h7

and White wins. ♦ 18...Kb4 19-g5 c4 20.g6 c3 21.Ke2 Ka3 22.gxh7 c2

23.Kd2 Kb2 24.h8=Q+.

I wasn't too upset by these additions. They basically verified my own conclusions. Then I found a bombshell waiting in my e- mail. A strong grandmaster (who wishes to remain anonymous) claimed that my analysis was completely flawed and that Black was better after all (that makes two grandmasters who were off their rocker!), though a draw would ultimately be the correct re- sult! Shocked, I glanced at his e-mail "blindfolded" (as the years roll by, I get lazier and lazier and often don't bother looking at a chessboard) and took his word for it (yes, I too am influenced by a high rating!). Sending the analysis to IM John Watson, he lam- basted me for listening to anyone (a very wise bit of criticism, by

SOLUTIONS / THE ENDGAME / 299

the way!). This prompted me to take a closer look and I immedi- ately saw that the grandmaster was hallucinating. (246) Black to play and demonstrate grandmaster dementia.

5...Kd5

The "Unknown Grandmaster" considered 5...Ke5 (the actual game continuation) to be a mistake. As we shall eventually see, it turns out that, in reality, both 5...Kd5 and 5...Ke5 lead to a draw.

6.Ke3 Kc6

Black's idea is to play ...b6-b5. I must admit that I'd never considered such a plan.

7.Kd3

The grandmaster claimed a Black win after 7.b4 Kd5 8.Kd3 f4

9.a5 bxa5 (this analysis is horribly flawed. Here, 9-..c4+ is the

correct way for Black to ice the game) 10.bxa5 (and now 10.c4+ gives White the better game!) 10...c4+ ll.Ke2 g4, but IM John Watson and Patrick Hummel (2300) pointed out that he was a bit off since 9.c4+ wins easily for White. IM Ron Burnett came back with a challenge: "Just how does White win after 9.c4+?" Fortu- nately, Mr. Hummel had answered this several days earlier and saved me the trouble of doing any real work: 9 c4+ Kd6 (9--.Ke5

10.bxc5 bxc5 11.a5 Kd6 12.Ke4 is easy for White) 10.b5 Ke5 ll.Ke2!

g4 (also hopeless is ll...Kf5 12.a5) 12.Kd3 and White's King will penetrate to e4 and enjoy a feast.

7...b5 I later discovered that this is a blunder and that Black

can still draw with a correct seventh move, though I'm leaving it

300 / THE REASSESS YOUR CHES5 WORKBOOK

to the reader to figure this out for himself. Now our mystery GM claims a draw after 8.axb5+ Kxb5 9.Ke2 Kc6 10.g3 Kd5 ll.Ke3 Ke5 12.Kf3 Kd5. However, IM Watson once again points out that White wins easily with 8.a5 (instead of 8.axb5+??) 8...b4 9cxb4 cxb4 10.Kd4 Kb5 ll.Ke5 Kxa5 12.Kxf5 Kb5 13.Kf6 Kc5 14.Kg7 and it's time for Black to hang up his Rooks. So what does this mean? Are IMs better endgame players than GMs (yes, published for the first time! IMs are indeed better than GMs at the endgame!)? Was the GM pulling my leg? Is there any meaning to unearth? I tend to think that the GMs in question were too lazy to give this position a serious look. But it does show that endgames can be very tricky, and that anyone is capable of com- pletely misjudging such a complicated situation. For those that are interested, the best defense appears to be:

5...Ke5

As played in the actual game. At the last second, I also discov- ered that 5...Kd5 draws in all lines! A small sample: 6.Ke3 Kc6

7.b4 Kd5 8.Kd3 Kc6 9.Kc4 cxb4 10.cxb4 b5+f ll.axb5+ Kb6 12.Kd5

Kxb5 13.Ke5 f4! and Black draws as in Peters' subsequent analy- sis to 5...Ke5. I'll leave it up to the reader to figure out all the other details (and there are LOTS of complicated details to figure out!) for himself.

(or the simple 13-Kf3) and Black's defense breaks down. Analysis by Patrick Hummel.

9.cxb4 Kd4 10.a5 bxa5 H.bxa5 Kc5 12.Kd3

This was given as a White win by Mr. Hummel and John Watson, but Jack Peters points out that the position is a draw.

12...Kb5 13.Kd4 Kxa5 14.Ke5 f4!

This very important, but simple, move was missed by Watson, Hummel and myself. Black's King looks awfully far away, doesn't it?

15.Kf5 Kb6 16.Kxg5 Kc6 17.Kf6

A book draw follows 17.Kxf4 Kd7 18.Kf5 Ke7 since Black's King gets to h8.

17...Kd7 18.Kg7 Ke7 19-Kxh7 Kf7 and now the point of

14...f4! is clear: White doesn't have a tempo move that will en-

able him to regain the opposition. Thus, the game is drawn. I gave this complicated analysis-really far outside the scope of the rather basic initial question-for three reasons: 1) Some players will get a lot of enjoyment going over the variations. 2) Some play- ers will learn quite a bit about typical King and pawn endgames. 3) This shows just how difficult King and pawn endgames can be. However, none of this would be possible without an understanding of basics like opposition and outside passed pawns.

Black's King is in check, but does the first player have any real winning chances? Sohrtftiioafll This position is hopelessly drawn. Even without the f-pawn, the game could and should be agreed drawn. An understanding of the following basic endgames would turn this into a trivial affair:

4 LUCENA: Black can't allow' White to reach a Lucena

position.

5.Kf6 Rf2+ 6.Kg5 Rg2+ 7.Rg4, 1-0

♦ PHILIDOR: Even if Black doesn't know the Philidor position and misplays the defense, he will still draw because White's remaining pawn is a g-pawn. This basic Philidor position leaves White with no chance to win. Black just moves his Rook back and forth on the 6th rank (...Ra6-c6-a6-c6, etc) and White will be unable to make progress. Eventually White will be compelled to play l.g6 when l...Ral or l...Rcl leaves White open to endless checks via ...Rhl+.

(252) Passive Rook loses. Black's passive Rook leads to his demise. White plays l.Rh7 Kg8 2.f7+ and wins instantly. In general, the defender must avoid this type of situation and strive to reach the calm waters of the Philidor position (previous diagram). (253) A mindless draw. In this diagram Black has played horribly and allowed White to milk the position for every possible advantage. Nevertheless, the fact that White's remaining pawn is a g-pawn makes the game uninteresting. The reason lies in the fact that White's Rook can't leap far enough to the other side of the King. l.Rh7 contains no threat as it did in the previous diagram. Going back to the position in our original diagram (249), we can appreciate that a Class C player (1400-1599) should draw a master with ease. Unfortunately, a nightmare ensues (I'm not sure if these are the exact moves, but the basic gist is accurate): l...Kg7

Preparing to make a bad check. Note the problem she is fac- ing here: Pam desperately wants to be active and fails to realize that passive defense would quickly draw the game. In general, it's very important to make your Rook active in Rook endgames. However, in the present situation her Rook is needed to defend against mates, stop enemy checks and bother the White King from the side and not from the rear, as she is trying to do here. A very simple draw could have been obtained by 2...f3 or the passive but effective 2...Rb7.

3.Ra7+ Kg8

4.Kh6 Rhl+??

Overlooking the reply! Seriously, why play a move that helps the opponent? By forc- ing White's King to g6, Black creates a mate threat against her own monarch. This leads to her King being pushed away from the front of the pawn. In turn, this sets the seeds for the creation of a winning Lucena Position. One simple way to draw was 4...Rb6+ 5.g6 Rb8 when, with an extra Black pawn, we have the position from diagram (253).

Problem 104 In an endgame, which minor piece dominates if there is a pawn race involving passed pawns on both sides of the board? The long-range ability of a Bishop makes it far superior to a Knight when running pawns exist on both sides of the board. Make sure you understand the middlegame and endgame implications of a Bishop versus Knight battle. Problem 105 In an endgame, what can you do to make a Knight superior to a Bishop? A Knight often rules in closed positions because it's the only piece that can jump over enemy or friendly pawns. A Knight also takes on added value in positions where all the pawns have been traded on one side of the board. By creating a situation where pawns only exist on one side of the board, the long-range abilities of the

White to move. White is obviously doing well, but claiming a clear, easy, win is quite another matter. Write down your general observations about this posi- tion and then, based on the power and logic of these observations, show a concrete way for White to proceed. The first thing that White must understand is that most four vs. three Rook endgames where all the pawns are on one side of the board should be avoided like the plague! In fact, the defending side should always try and trade pawns on one -side of the board. This leaves him with a much smaller area to defend and less tar- gets to worry about. Rook endgames with pawns on one side of the board are either drawn or are nightmares to win. With this in mind, we can see that White has no interest in trading off the a-pawns. For example, l.g3 Rc3 2.Rdl Rxa3 3.Rdd7 Rf8 4.Rxa7 Rxa7 5.Rxa7 isn't even a consideration for White! Two White problems are:

So White must find a way to end the back rank threat, defend his a-pawn, restrain Black's Rooks and activate his own. No won- der Black thought that he had some real chances to hold the game!

A fine move that allows the White Rooks to dominate their Black counterparts. The immediate l.g3 allows l...Rc3 2.Rai when White's al-Rook is doomed to a passive life. Making sure your Rooks stay active is one of the most important concepts in Rook endgames! The point of l.Rb4 is shown by the fact that this Rook, on b7, previously attacked the a-pawm but it didn't serve any defensive function. From b4, it will move to a4 where it will attack a7 and also defend a3. This frees the other Rook, which can now seek an active role in the game.

Now the f-pawn isn't defended. This becomes important in the next couple of moves.

SOLUTIONS / THE ENDGAME / 311

Problem 107 (255) Smyslov-Golombek, London 1947. White to move. White is clearly better here, but a forced win is nowhere in sight. Can you formulate a plan that will give you some chances to score the full point? White is better due to his more active King and his superior pawn structure. To increase his advantage, White must place his Knight on g4 and his Bishop on c3, dominating the enemy Knight. Any trade of White's Bishop for Black's Knight will increase the first player's chances because the Black Bishop has very little mobility while the White Knight can dance to almost any square on the board. Once White gets his Bishop to c3 and his Knight to g4, the threat of Nf6 will force Black's h-pawn to move to h5. This, in turn, weakens the g-pawn. When this is done. White will train his sights on g6 and, if necessary, freeze it in its tracks by h2-h3 followed by g3-g4-g5. In the game this plan worked out brilliantly, and Smyslov's play is well worth serious study: l.Ndl! Making way for the Bishop's relocation to c3, and also pre- paring to bring the Knight to g4 via Ndl-f2-g4. l...Bd6 Black wasn't enticed by l...e5 since, aside from the fact that the d5-square is seriously weakened and made accessible to the White Knight via Ne3-d5, the creation of a kingside pawn major- ity w'ould be much simpler to achieve after 2.f5.

> Black's queenside pawns are on the color of his (and White's!) Bishop. > Black's Bishop is an inactive piece. Thus, White isn't adverse to trading his Bishop for Black's Knight because he would then be left with a good Knight versus a poor Black Bishop. White is a pawn down, his remaining pawn on g5 is weak, and his Knight on g3 is hanging. Things look grim for the first player. Is there any hope of holding this position? There are several options open to White: He can trade Queens and seek salvation in an opposite colored Bishop endgame with two pawns less (after l.Qxd6+ Kxd6 Black would also pick up the g-pawn); he can check on a5; and he can calmly play l.Qe3 and just try to hang on for dear life. Without some basic endgame knowledge concerning Bish- ops, this position would prove to be an unsolvable riddle. How- ever, possession of seemingly unimportant knowledge can often make the most mysterious of problems relatively easy to solve. Let's take a moment and build a foundation that will lead us right to the answer. We have all heard about the infamous Bish- ops of opposite color. These two pieces rest on different colored squares and will never meet on the chessboard. All very interest- ing, but what this means is less clear. Are Bishops of opposite colors good or bad? The following rules should prove useful:

SOLI TIOX.S / THE ENDGAME / 315

Rule 1 - Bishops of opposite colors favor the attacker since he can attack something that the defender's Bishop will not be able to defend. White to move. White can win immediately by using the combined power of his Bishop and Queen to attack the g7-pawn: l.Qe5 forces resig- nation because l.,.f6 allows 2.Qxe6+, picking up a pawn and the Rook on c8. If Black's Bishop had been a dark-squared Bishop sitting on e7. then he could have defended easily by ...Bf8 or ...Bf6. However, the light-squared Bishop was unable to assist in the defense of the g7-point. Rule 2 - In endgames, Bishops of opposite colors are notorious for their drawish characteristics. This is because most pieces have been traded off; the Bish- ops, bereft of help from other pieces, become defen- sive. This means that one can defend what the other cannot attack, and an enemy King by itself cannot break down the defense the Bishop gives. (258) White to move.

316 / THE REASSESS YOUR CHESS WORKBOOK

White enjoys a two~pawn advantage but he can't win because Black's Bishop defends his queenside pawn and simultaneously stops both of the White pawns in that sector. The extra pawn on the kingside is also useless because the Black King can't be chased away from f5. Note how White's Bishop plays no part in the action on either side of the board. Rule 3 - Keeping points one and two in mind, we can say that when opposite colored Bishops exist, the stronger side can optimize his winning chances by retaining as many pieces as possible. In other words, don't exchange pieces without good reason!. (259) Black to move. This position is drawn, even though White has an extra pawn. Black's Bishop will go to d4 and his King will move to e7; then White will find it impossible to do anything decisive.

SOLUTIONS / THE ENDGAME / 31/

Now Black's King and Rook are stuck guarding the pawn on f7. Add the attacking power of the White Rook into the equation (for example, it threatens l.Rd6 when l...Bd8 2.Rxg6+ picks up a pawn, and l...Bd4 2.Bxf7+ also adds to his spoils), and you can see just how poor the Black position has become. Rule 4 - A one-pawn advantage is not enough to win if no other pawns exist on the board. Moreover, even two pawns may not suffice if the enemy King and Bishop can form a blockade. White has two extra pawns, but neither of them is going any- where. If White plays his King to e3, f3, g4 and f5, Black will play ...Bd4 followed by ...Kd6 and the pawns will still be stuck. Rule 5 - In general, a two pawn vs. zero pawn advantage grows in significance if the pawns are far apart. The further apart the pawns, the greater the chance of winning. The reason for this is that the defending King and Bishop are not able to work together to form a blockade as they were in the previous diagram. The next diagram shows how easy the win can be if the pawns have enough distance between them.

318 / THE REASSESS YOCR CHESS WORKBOOK

White wins by advancing his g-pawn and King, winning the enemy Bishop for this pawn, and then walking to the queenside to help escort his final pawn to the promoting square: l.g5 Kc6

2.Ke5 Kd7 3.b5 Bc4 4.b6 Kc6 5.Be3 Bb3 6.Kf6 Bd5 7.g6 Kd7

8.g7 Kc6 9.Ke7 followed by 10.Kf8 and ll.g8=Q.

Rule 6 - Two connected passed pawns will not win if the defending side knows how to create the correct defensive set-up. Diagram (263) shows the correct drawing technique. White can't hope to win. His King is stuck defending the e- pawn and, if he plays l.d5+, then l...Bxd5 ends matters. Also useless is l.e5 since l...Bd5 followed by moving the Bishop back and forth creates a complete blockade. If White passes with some- thing like l.Kf4, then simply l...Bb7 followed by ...Bc6 shows White the futility of his efforts.

SOLUTIONS / THE ENDGAME / 319

(264) White to move. Let's clarify the previous point by taking a look at this posi- tion. Has Black managed to create the drawing scenario that we learned in diagram (263)? No. he didn't. Though the positions look very similar, Black is actually lost in this example. Of course, if the position of Black's King and Bishop were reversed (Black King on e7 and Black Bishop on c7), then Black would draw easily. However, the position in question is lost because the Bishop is not attacking White's e5-pawn. The defending Bishop needs to attack e5 AND simultaneously prevent d5-d6+. Thus, placing Black's Bishop on g7 is hopeless because it fails to stop d5-d6+. This tiny detail changes the result because now White's King is free to roam to e6 and help his pawns advance: l.Kf5 Bf8 2.Ke6 Kd8 3-d6 Bh6 4.Kd5 Bg7 5.e6 If the pawns get to the sixth rank they always win. 5- Bf8 6.Ba4 Kc8 7.e7 and the pawn Queens. Compare this and the previous diagrams carefully until the differences between them become obvious to you. Now it's time for us to return to our original position and original question. Our newfound knowledge should help us find an easy answer to this enigma. Keeping the Queens on with 1 Qa5+ or l.Qe3 is possible, but doesn't the presence of the Queens and Knights favor the stronger side? This means that we should trade as many pieces as possible. If we can get rid of the Queens and Knights, we should draw, even if we lose the g-pawn, by using the techniques shown in diagram (263). Clearly, the fact that the two connected passed pawns don't win with Bishops of opposite colors is an important bit of information!

320 / THE REASSESS YOUR CHESS WORKBOOK

Let's follow our endgame rules and see how easy it is to hold this position: l.Qxd6+ Kxd6 2.Ne4+ Nxe4 3-Bxe4 Bxg5 4.Kf3 f5 5.Bbl Ke5 6.Ba2 This ties the Black King down to the defense of his e6-pawn, thus forcing him to move it. Once this pawn moves we will enter the parameters of our drawing position from diagram 263.

6...Kf6 7-Bb3 e5 8.Bc2! followed by Bd3-c2-d3, etc. The draw

is now simple. So things were pretty easy for us once we acquired some basic knowledge about Bishop of opposite color endgames. Even the hardest problems soften up if we simply go back to basics!

SOLUTIONS / THE ENDGAME / 321

Problem 109 (265) Black to move. Can Black draw this position? Black can easily draw this position by trading Rooks and entering a pure Bishops of opposite colors endgame. Remember: when you're two pawns down (in a two to nothing situation), the closer the pawns are, the greater the drawing chances. Why? Because the defending King and Bishop can work together to form a solid blockade, thanks to the fact that the stronger side's Bishop can't challenge the same squares as the defending Bishop. Black wants to trade Rooks because, in general, the stronger side usually wants to keep as many pieces on the board as pos- sible. In this way, you can make use of the attacking powers of the Bishops of opposite colors. l...Rd6+! With the Rooks gone, Black doesn't have to worry about any- thing but blocking those two White pawns.

No, it's inferior, but easy to understand. The machine wanted to develop, and White, supposedly, won't take the Black Knight because Bishops are better than Knights in the endgame (most computers have been programmed to believe this drivel). Natu- rally, there followed:

2.Bxe4!

The truth is that White's Knight is far superior to Black's Bishop in this position. In fact, the only piece able to challenge the d4-Knight was the Black horse on e4. The poor computer, though, is a prisoner of its programming. Of course, many hu- mans are guilty of the same flaw, but that's another story en- tirely.

Take a little time and see if you can figure out a winning plan. Alekhine claims a forced win (not hard to imagine, considering the fact that every positional factor is in his favor) and gives four phases to secure the victory: Phase One: 23.h4! followed by g4 and g5 on which Black will have nothing better than ...h5, seeing that the exchange of pawns abandons the square h4 to White's Knight.

Let's try to explain things in a clearer fashion; Black is passively placed and can't do anything active; all lie can do is sit around and try to stop While from breaking through. This means that you can take all the time you want to set up some ideal position. It's important to understand this! To win, White must create as many targets as possible. His main targets-pawns that can't be defended by other pawns-are e5 and g6. Toanake sure that the g6-pawn remains on that vulner- able square, White starts out with 23.h4!. Next on the agenda is 24.g4 and g5. Now the g6 pawn is stuck on g6 forever. When this is done, White changes the guard on e4: he will move his King to that square and place his Knight on d3 so both pieces can gang up on e5, To defend the e-pawn, Black must move his King to d6. While then administers the coup de grace: a timely f244 forces ...exf4 when Nxf4 brings the Knight into range of g6. That pawn is lost and While wins the game. Here's how this plan might develop:

Problem 114 (270) Suveg-Cook, Golden Knights (corr.) 1997. White to move. This is an extremely interesting endgame. Who do you think stands better? I'm looking for a general feel of the position rather than a spe- cific move. Though White is up a pawn, it's doubled, though not completely useless-he can trade the g3-pawn for the h7-pawn and be left with an extra passer. Perhaps the most important imbalance here is that of Bishop versus Knight. Usually a Bishop is superior to a Knight when passed pawns exist all over the board, and this position sees the White Knight going through contortions to stay up with the faster Bishop. So Black has a superior minor piece and White has an extra pawn. White's a-pawn is also weak while the passed d-pawn might become threatening if Black doesn't use a bit of care. I'd have to assess this very difficult position as being equal. The game continuation appears to verify this: l.Nf2 The Knight wasn't happy on g4, so it gives itself more op- tions. Now it can jump to e4, or it can maneuver its way to f4 or g5 via h3.

8.Bc4!

Alekhine says: "The best square for this Bishop. The reply 8...d5 is clearly not to be feared, as it would merely enhance the prospects of the opposing f4- Bishop." This little move is quite instructive, because most players would fear the "tempo-gaining" 8...d5. The re- alization that this push helps activate your other Bishop is something that should be pondered. Don't go to the next move until you completely understand the rea- soning behind White's eighth move.

8...Re8

Alekhine says: "Preparing ...e5, which will, however, have the disadvantage of weakening the square d6."

334 / THE REASSESS YOUR CHESS WORKBOOK

A very interesting moment. Any titled player would instantly recognize two key factors in this position: 1) the potential tactical target on 17 and, 2) the positional target on d6. Ihe tactical target is easy to notice-the c4-Bishop is striking at f7 and Black's Rook no longer defends that pawn. The positional target is a lot more esoteric. How is a non- master expected to notice such a thing? Well, the first thing you must ask is, "Why did my opponent play his move and what in the world is this guy up to?" It's only possible to see d6 as a potential weakness when you understand that ...e7-e5 is going to be played (any pawn or square that can't be defended by another pawn is a potential weakness). Before we go on so that you can see how Alekhine took ad- vantage of these facts, I should point out that a tactical device, like the one Alekhine ultimately employs against f7, is often used as a tool to achieve some positional end. In this game, Alekhine attacks f7 in order to gain enough time to swing his pieces to squares where they can menace d6.

A battle is about to ensue and you don't want your King sitting in the center when this occurs!

It should be pointed out that, in this last variation, White would be hoping for an ...e5-e4 advance since that would increase the range of the h2-Bishop and bring it to bear on the d6-square.

initiative with this positional solution (12.Bxe6) to 12.Nxe5 and the pursuit of greed. ll.Bxe5! A move that perplexes many amateurs and was completely ignored in Alekhine's notes! I suppose he felt that ll.Bxe5 was so obviously good that anyone would easily understand it. If my students are any indication of the chess-playing public, then this is most definitely not the case! According to my observations, most amateurs would reject ll.Bxe5 and instead consider ll.Nxe5, ll.Be2 or ll.Bb5. Both ll.Be2 and ll.Bb5 waste a tempo and move the Bishop away from its powerful post on c4. Also losing time is ll.Nxe5 since the f4-Bishop would have to move after ll...dxe5. All three of these moves cater to the whims of the opponent-he orders you about and you react.

16.Nd6 with a clear advantage, though any talk of a forced win is

still a long way off.

13.Bxe6 fxe6 14.Nde4 Nxe4 15.Qxd8

We've already dragged some opening and middlegame in- struction out of this game, now it's time for an endgame lesson! This proves my point about a "total experience." A good master game gives you a taste of just about everything chess has to offer.

15...Rexd8 16.Nxe4 b6 17.Rfdl KfiB 18.Kfl

As usual, once an endgame is reached, both Kings rush to- wards the center.

18...Ke7 19x4

An important move that takes the d5-square away from the Black pieces and also fixes the c5-pawn on a dark square. This makes sure that Black's Bishop remains as blocked in as possible.

19."h6 2O.Ke2 Rxdl 21.Rxdl

2...g6

This tends to sharpen the game and, since Black is much higher rated, this is exactly what the second player wants to do. The classical 2...d5 is often met, at least at the amateur level, by the easy to understand Colle System (3.e3 followed by Nbd2, Bd3, O-O, c3, and e3-e4).

3.Bg5

338 / THE REASSESS YOUR CHESS WORKBOOK

White, who desperately wants to avoid theory, has no inten- tion of going into a main line King's Indian Defense or Grunfeld by 3.c4.

3...Bg7 4.Nbd2

Intending to take the lion's share of the center with 5.e4.

4...d5

This stops White from advancing to ei. though it does give White some access to the e5-square.

5.e3 Ne4?

(273) Black goes a bit too far! White to move. A mistake. Black feels he is stronger than his opponent and wants to create some action. However, it seems that even masters don't realize that quiet, correct play-the obvious 5. -.O-O followed by central expansion by ...Nbd7, ...Qe8 and ...e7-e5, for example- will often lead to easy wins with little risk.

6.Nxe4 dxe4 7.Nd2

Now White has the superior pawn structure, and he's already exerting pressure on the e4-pawn.

7...c5

Black's trying hard to rip open the long black diagonal for his g7-Bishop.

8.c3 cxd4 9,exd4

Taking back this way is fairly common in this system, but here I'd have preferred 9.cxd4, fixing the weakness on e4 and opening up the c-file.

SOLUTIONS / SELF-ANNOTATIONS / 339

9.. Qd5

This guards e4 and attacks the Bishop on g5, but the Queen isn't safe on this square. However, Black's position would have been full of holes after 9-..f5 10.Bc4.

10.Be3 O-O ll.Be2?

What's wrong with the obvious, and far more aggressive, ll.Bc4? Black's e4-pawn would then be in serious trouble. For example: ll.Bc4 Qf5 12.Qbl b5 13-Bb3 Bb7 14.Bc2 and the pawn drops off the board.

12.Qb3

White gives his opponent too much credit. I'd have still gone after e4 by 12.Bc4 Qc6 13.d5 Qc7 14.Bb3 when the e4-pawn is ready to be placed in its box. Apparently, White didn't realize how weak e4 was, and he didn't realize that the Black Queen was very insecure on d5.

12...Qxb3 13-Nxb3 f5 14.d5 b6 15.Rdl

White thinks that his passed d-pawn is destined for great things, but this isn't true. I would have preferred a plan based on a2-a4- a5, which means that White's Rook would want to remain on al. After White castles, Rfdl would be the way to go. This could be prefaced by 15.14, to stop Black from playing ...f5-f4, when 15...exf3

16.gxf3 contains the Black majority, while 15...exf4 16.Bxf4 gives

the White Knight access to the d4-square. White's 15.Rdl looks nice, but he doesn't really have any detailed plan in mind, just some vague notion of making use of his passed pawn. Remember: don't just concentrate on what you have, try your best to constantly create new plusses that can be utilized on the path to victory.

15...Bb7 16.Bg5?

White doesn't realize how important this Bishop is. By trading it off. White makes it easier for Black to form a blockade on the c5 and d6 squares.

340 / THE REASSESS YOUR CHESS WORKBOOK

16...Bf6 17.Bxf6 Rxf6 18x4 Nd7 19.O-O

This position favors Black because: 1) White's d-pawn isn't going anywhere. 2) White's Bishop is very bad. 3) Black will be able to blockade the White pawns by playing for control over the c5 and d6 squares. 4) Black's majority of pawns is active, while White's passed d-pawn will soon be static. Black's advantage turned decisive after 19...a5 2O.a4 Kf8

21.Rcl?! Ke7 22.Nal? Nc5 23-b3 f4

Summary of the Imbalances and Ideas Viewed in this Game > Black weakened his own pawn formation. This let White create easy pressure against Black's e4-pawn. > Black's Queen was vulnerable, but White never made use of this important fact. > White had a passed d-pawn, but Black was able to completely blockade it. Remember that a passed pawn is only useful if you have play elsewhere (in other words, you use the pawn as endgame insurance) or you have control over the square in front of it, turning the pawn into an active advantage.

SOLUTIONS / SELF-ANNOTATIONS / 341

With l...d6 Black has offered to transpose into a Pirc De- fense after 2.e4 Nf6 3-Nc3 g6 (this usually arrives via l.e4 d6

2.d4 Nf6, etc.).

2x4 Naturally, 2.e4 is the most principled reply, but 2.Nf3, stop- ping ...e7-e5, has also proved popular when 2...Bg4 3x4 Bxf3 4,gxf3 leads to a very interesting position-White's two Bishops versus Black's superior pawn structure. 2".e5 3-d5 To many it would seem very attractive to play 3-dxe5 dxe5

4.Qxd8+ since after 4...Kxd8 Black's King has lost the right to

castle. However, the absence of Queens and the fact that Black's King will be quite safe after ...c7-c6 (this takes away the b5 and d5 squares from a White Knight on c3) followed by ...Kc7 makes this method of handling the opening rather innocuous for White. For example: 5.Nf3 (after 4...Kxd8) 5...f6 6.Nc3 Be6 7.b3 c6 8.Bb2 Nd7 9-g3 Kc7 is quite comfortable for the second player. Since neither 3-dxe5 nor 3-d5 offer White a theoretical advan- tage, he does best to try 3-Nf3 when 3-..e4 4.Ng5 f5 5.Nc3 trans- poses into a sharp line of the English Opening.

3...f5

Black immediately gains space on the kingside in anticipation of an eventual kingside attack.

4.Nc3 Nf6 5.Bg5

A new move. Presumably, White intends to get rid of Black's key central Knight and initiate a fight for the e4-square. In Alburt-Miles, USA ch. 1988, White tried the immediate 5.e4 but Black achieved equal play after 5...Nxe4 6.Nxe4 fxe4 7.Ne2 Be7 8,Ng3 O-O 9.Nxe4 Bf5 10.Bd3 Nd7 ll.Be3 Bxe4 12.Bxe4 Bg5 (trad- ing his bad Bishop for White's good one) 13.Qh5 Nf6 (changing tack and swapping his Bishop for White's on e4) 14.Qxg5 Nxe4. 5-..Be7 6.Bxf6 Bxf6 7x4 O-O The first major moment in the game. Does this let White "win" the e4-square? Did either player even consider this important question?

342 / THE REASSESS YOUR CHESS WORKBOOK

Alternatives are: 7...g6!? (this shows good positional sense)

8.exf5 gxf5 (this pawn gives Black a firm hold over e4) 9.Qh5+

Ke7 (Black's King is quite safe here) and 7...f4, though in this case White would exchange his bad Bishop by 8.Be2 followed by 9-Bg4 (leaving Black with a poor Bishop on f6, though a later ,..c7-c6 followed by ...Bf6-d8-b6 might bring it back to life). (274) Can White win the e4-square? White to move.

8.Nf3

This brings us to the game's second major moment. White could try to turn e4 into a home for his pieces by 8.exf5 Bxf5

9.Bd3. Black would be clearly worse if he meekly traded on d3

and allowed White to follow up with Ne4. However, the fact that he wants to activate his dark-square Bishop, and the fact that White's King isn't castled, prompts the second player into shifting to a higher gear by 9 --e4!, opening the position and freeing the f6-Bishop. Therefore, 8.exf5 isn't sufficient for a White plus.

8...Na6

Heading for c5, but 8...g6, intending to meet 9.exf5 with ...gxf5, should have been given serious consideration.

9.Bd3 f4 10.h3?I

This can't be right. Why make an unnecessary weakening move on the kingside? White would love to exchange light-squared Bishops-his Bishop is bad while Black's is good -so ...Bg4 could always be met by Be2 followed by Nd2 (the Bishop is no longer doing anything on d3).

SOLUTIONS ! SELF-ANNOTATIONS / 343

10...Nc5 11.O-O a5 12.Na4 Nxa4?!

White's Knight on a4 is poorly placed, while White's "bad" Bishop on d3 can eventually go to e2 and make Black's ...g7-g5- g4 advance harder to achieve. Therefore, 12...Nxd3 13-Qxd3 b6 followed by ...g7-g5, ...h7-h5, and ...g5-g4 with a strong kingside attack, was indicated.

13.Qxa4 Bd7 14.Qc2 Kh8?

White's play will come on the queenside via c4-c5, gain- ing space and opening lines in that sector, so Black should have tossed in 14...b6, making a break on that side much harder to achieve. 15-c5 Qe8 16.c6 White's heart is in the right place, but 16.cxd6 cxd6 17.Qc7 Be7 18.Qxb7 Rb8 19 Qa6 was very tempting.

16...bxc6 17.dxc6 Bc8

Black wisely reasons that White's own c-pawn will block his Queen, Rooks and Bishop from penetrating into the queenside. 18-Rabl Qg6? When the center is closed you must play on the wings with pawns. These battering rams, with the rest of the army following, will gain space and open up lines for the Rooks. With this in mind, we can see that Black should have preferred 18...g5 fol- lowed by 19.. h5 and 20...g4 with strong threats on the kingside.

19.Khl Qh6 2O.Qe2 g5 21.Nh2

Now Black's much-needed ...g5-g4 advance will be difficult to achieve.

21...Rg8 22.Ng4?

A very bad move that forces the Black Queen out of the way of the h-pawn. White has to learn to avoid this kind of one-move threat.

22...Qg6 23.b4

344 / THE REASSESS YOUR CHESS WORKBOOK

White has to open up lines on the queenside and create threats there before Black takes over the game with his kingside attack. 23-..axb4 24.Rxb4 Be7 Also playable is 24...h5!? 25.Nxf6 Qxf6 26.Qxh5+ Kg7 27.Qe2 f3! 28.Qxf3 Qxf3 29.gxf3 when both 29...Rf8 and 29...Rh8 give Black adequate compensation for the sacrificed material. How- ever, Black's 24...Be7, intending to gain time on the Knight, seems to be a more promising move.

25.f3 h5 26.Nf2 g4!

Black's attack is now very dangerous.

27.fxg4 hxg4

Every piece should be brought into the attack, so 27...Bh4!? would be the move I would want to play. This prepares to chop off White's main defensive piece with ...Bxf2 followed by ...hxg4 when White will have enormous trouble holding the position. Of course, in such positions, good intentions have to be backed up by tactical analysis since normal positional considerations and rules often fall victim to the harsher truths of brute force calculation. After 27...Bh4!? 28.Bc4 Rg7 29.Qf3 (things really heat up after

29.Rfbl hxg4 3O.Rb8 f3 31.Qfl gxh3 and now 32.g3 Qxg3 33-Rxa8

Qg2+ leads to a win for Black. However, 32.g4!! appears to be a draw: 32...Rxb8 33.Rxb8 Kh7 34.Rxc8 Bxf2 35.Qxh3+ Qh6 36.Rh8+ Kxh8 37.Qxh6+ Rh7) 29...hxg4 3O.Nxg4 Bxg4 31.Qxg4 Qxg4 32,hxg4 Rxg4 33Rb7 Rg7 Black, who threatens 34...Bg3, seems to be doing well, but White has the surprising 34.g4!! when he's okay. It wouldn't be a shock if subsequent analysis proved that Black was on top after 27...Bh4 but, at the moment, I have to accept that 27...hxg4 is Black's best chance for an edge. Why am I luke warm about 27...hxg4? My main gripe is that Black seems to be in a hurry to exchange Queens. It's important to point out that, in general, the side that is attacking the King wants to avoid Queen trades-the Queens offer the attacker a knockout punch. The side playing for a queenside attack is happy to swap Queens because he is usually much better in the

SOLUTIONS / SELF-AN NOTATIONS / 345

endgame-the queenside attack plays for small positional gains that translate to a good endgame while a kingside attack is often a do or die proposition. In the present position, though, Black's attack continues even if he chops the Queens off the board.

28.Nxg4 Bxg4 29.Qxg4 Qxg4

I would have tried 29...Qh6l? followed by 3O...Rg3 when Black would retain some serious attacking chances. A sample of what might occur: 3O.Qe2 Rg3 31.Rb7 Re3 32.Qd2 Bg5 33-Rlbl f3 34.Rb8+ Rxb8 35.Rxb8+ Kg7 36.Rb7 Rel! 37.Rxc7+ Kg6 38.Qxd6+ Bf6 39-Qd3 Qf2 and Black wins. 3O.hxg4 Rxg4 31-Rb7 Bd8?? Much stronger was 31..Rxa2 (also interesting is 31. ..d5l?) with a simple yet compelling threat against g2.

32.Bc4 Kg7 33.Rfbl Kf8 34.Rb8 Rxb8 35.Rxb8 Ke7 36,a4

Rg3 37.Rb3?? White had the game in the palm of his hand, but he throws it away by trading the Rooks. This allows the famous drawing ten- dencies of Bishops of opposite colors to take effect (in general, the stronger side wants to retain as many pieces as possible to work with his Bishop, thus highlighting the attacking potential of Bishops of opposite colors). If you look at what each Rook is doing, it becomes clear that White's is tying up Black's King and Bishop, effectively leaving him in a helpless state. Therefore, where's the logic in exchang- ing a very strong Rook for a passive one? White could have won with the straightforward 37.a5! Ra3 (37...Rc3 38.a6!) 38.a6 when Black can still squirm with 38...d5 (passive play lets White win mundanely with Ra8 followed by a7, bringing the King to b4, and then Bb5-a4, blocking off the Black Rooks control of a7 and a8), but 39.exd5 e4 4O.d6+! cxd6 41.Rb7+ followed by c7 will still award White with the full point.

37...Rxb3 38.Bxb3 d5!

This lets the Black King join in the defense.

Summary of the Imbalances and Ideas Viewed in this Game > Neither side seemed to be aware of the importance of the e4-square. > The game eventually degenerated into a common queenside versus kingside attack, delineated by the closed center, forcing each side to seek his chances on the wings. In such positions, Black must throw everything, including the kitchen sink, at the White King, and he almost always wants to avoid Queen trades because that effectively ends his threat of a knockout. > White must try and hold off the Black attack.

Very sensible. With Nf3, White doesn't do anything to chal- lenge Black's control over the e4-square. Due to this, Black quickly prepares to move his Bishop to b7 where it will join with the f6- Knight in fighting for the key central squares d5 and e4. 3x3 White could still transpose into the main line Queen's Indian Defense by 3 c4 e6 4.g3 Bb7 5.Bg2.

3...Bb7 4.Bd3 e6 5.Nbd2

It's now clear that White will move his pawn to c3 where it will defend d4 and keep Black's pieces off of b4. In general, White plays c2~c4 if he intends to place the Knight behind it so both pawn and Knight hit d5. If the Knight goes to d2, the pawn usually ends up on c3-

5...C5 6x3 Nc6 7.O-O

So far both sides have handled the opening reasonably well. White intends to play for central expansion via e3-e4 while Black can try and forestall this by 7...d5. Black's next move, though, gives us the first hint about his true King-hunting psychosis.

7...Bd6??

Awful. Black is so intent in aiming everything at White's King that he ignores such "minor" things as central play and castling. Simply put, play in the center always beats play on the wings. Of course, Black doesn't believe this and decides that it's time to strike out at his opponent. 8x4 Hitting Black in the center and creating an immediate threat of 9.e5, forking Black's pieces.

What's important to understand is that this is a normal stage in one's chess development. You take in information, you pick up experience, your brain quietly (even secretly!) fights to digest all this new material and, suddenly, you wake up one day hun- dreds of points stronger than when you laid your head on the pillow a few short hours before. For those that are not able to wake up from their "nightmare of chess inadequacy," the most likely explanation for this all-too- common full stop to chess enlightenment resides in a lack of understanding in some key area of the game. Do your openings make you a laughing stock? Does the idea of an attack make you fall to your knees and quake in fear? Is positional play your personal cure for insomnia? Does the endgame remind you of the green vegetables your parents forced you to eat during childhood? If you wish to rise above the quagmire that most of us find ourselves in from time to time, you must figure out the weakest phase of your game and do everything you can to educate your- self in that particular area. The only way to accomplish this in your own play is to go over your games with a fine-tooth comb- if you don't know your weaknesses, you can't do anything to weed them out! Here we'll use the following game (annotated by you) as a sort of guinea pig. If you can figure out Pam's weaknesses, then you should be able to do the same for your own. Pam Ruggiero (2100)-D.

Pam knows some openings fairly well, but has no knowledge whatsoever of other systems. Here White usually plays 4.d4, try- ing to take advantage of his lead in development by tearing open the position. However, that would require some book knowledge and she didn't want to go into a sharp opening line unprepared. This is a wise philosophy. By playing for space and keeping things quiet, she hopes to get an interesting middlegame with minimum opening risk.

4...a6

This doesn't seem right. Black lets White's Bishop eventually get back into play on b3 or c2. Sensible alternatives are 4...g6,

4...Ngf6, 4...e6, or 4...e5, shutting down the center.

5.Ba4 Qc7

Black is worried about a possible e4-e5 advance, so he spends a tempo to stop it. Apparently, White's quiet approach to the opening has confused her opponent.

6.Nc3 e6

7.O-O Ngf6

8.Qe2

White defends c4 before pushing her d-pawn to d4. She wants to play d2-d4 because, on d3, the pawn would doom her light- squared Bishop to everlasting passivity.

8...Be7

9.d4 cxd4

10.Nxd4 O-O

11.Be3 Nb6?

Very ugly. This Knight doesn't have a future on b6. No doubt it's a reaction to 11...b6 12.Nc6, picking up Black's valuable dark-squared Bishop. Instead of ll...Nb6, Black should have tried ll...Ne5 or ll...Nc5, with a perfectly playable position in either case. (276) Does Black's Knight belong on b6? White to move.

Trying to force the issue against a lower-rated opponent, Black loses his grip on the light-squares.

13.Nf5 Bxf5

15.g4!?

A "normal" way to handle this position is 15.Rael (the best move) when White's two Bishops give her a clear advantage. Note that 15.Racl Nxc4?? loses material to 16.Bxc4 Qxc4 17.Qxc4 Rxc4 18.Nd5. Quiet play isn't Pam's specialty, though. Instead, she loves to increase the tension and declare an all-out war for the initiative, even if it's not completely sound! 15".h6 Black doesn't fall for 15...Nxc4?? 16.g5 Nd7 (or 16...Nxe3

17.gxf6) 17.Nd5.

16.h4 Nh7

The usual recipe for White's kingside expansion. By covering the g5-square and attacking h4, it seems that Black has refuted White's plan. In fact, many strong players would have rejected White's g4-g5 idea due to this well-known remedy, but Pam is rarely a victim of convention.

17.g5!

Bringing her opponent back to reality. By sacrificing a pawn, she retains the initiative and rips open the h-file for her Rooks. It's not clear if White's attack will really work, but the pressure this places on the opponent is far from easy to deal with.

Simple and to the point. The threat of Rhl brings Black to his knees.

21...Nh7??

23.cxd5 Qg5

The Queen exchange fails to put out the flames of the White attack.

Sad, but 26...Nf7 also loses to 27.d7! Rc7 28.Rahl Nc4 29.Nd5. 27-Rahl, 1-0. A total catastrophe for Black! White's Bishop and d6-pawn join forces with the White Rooks to weave a mating net around the Black King. An impressive display by Pam, who looked like she was the higher rated player disposing of some- one far below her in strength. Pam's Strengths and Weaknesses: ♦ Pam is not comfortable in quiet positions, much preferring a more forcing tempo of play. If this describes you, it might prove instructive to study the games of positional players like Karpov, Ulf Anderssen, and Petrosian. ♦ Pam is not an opening specialist, but she makes up for this by playing in a logical fashion. This game proves that intelligent, sensible moves and an understanding of your opening's basic ideas far outweigh brute memorization.

SOLUTIONS / SELF'ANNOTATIONS / 355

♦ Pam has a tremendous grasp of the initiative. If you can't emulate that kind of heat, then a study of the games of Alekhine, Tai, and Kasparov should prove useful. ♦ Pam has good tactical vision. Constantly studying books of tactical quizzes will help you in this phase of the game. Summary of the Imbalances and Ideas Viewed in this Game > White got more central space right out of the opening. > White got two Bishops. Black eventually missed his guardian of the light-squares. > When her pawn reached f5, she was able to claim more space on the kingside.

The King's Indian Defense fits Pam's style like a glove. It's very important to find openings that suit your tastes and comple- ment your strengths. This opening is also sensible in that it can be used against every opening move other than l.e4.

6.Bg5

The Averbach Variation is a favorite of GMs Kaidanov, Yermolinsky and Bareev.

6...Na6

A good system. Black will play ...e7-e5 when the c5-square will eventually be available to this Knight. In some lines, the Knight shows its versatility by defending the c7-square.

7.Qd2 e5

8.d5 Qe8

It seems that Pam knows her theory. This move breaks the pin, prepares to move the f6-Knight and, as a result, frees the f- pawn for its key advance to f5. Note the importance of an eventual ...f7-f5 push. The center is closed so that leaves both players scrambling for domination of the wings. In the present case, Black's pawn chain c7-d6-e5 "points" to the kingside, and so that is where Black's space lies and that is where she should seek her chances.

9.f3

The most accurate response is thought to be 9.Bd3 with Nge2 to follow.

9...NB5

Knowing the main ideas of your openings is critical. Here, Pam plays for the thematic ...f7-f5 advance as quickly as she can.

Unnecessary. Probably best is lO.Bdl followed by ll.Nge2.

Yet another thematic KID idea. Black would love White to take on fh and open up the g7-al diagonal. Sacrificing a pawn for control of the dark squares is a small price to pay, though here the f4-pawn turns out to be poison: 12.Bxf4? exf4 13.Qxf4 fxe4

14.Qxe4 Bh6+.

12.g3 Ng2!?

14.Bfl Ne3

15.Bxe3 fxe3

362 / THE REASSESS YOUR CHESS WORKBOOK

head-all these little aches and pains began to make sense to us as experience grew and injuries mounted. Strangely enough, these early life lessons don't seem to carry over into our understanding of chess. We charge a solid wall of pawns and end up bouncing off painfully. We dash at an enemy King and wonder why we failed to drag it down. We attack enemy pieces and get agitated when they simply move out of the way or even show the rude- ness to attack us back. Believe it or not, there is a connection between a concrete wall and a solid wall of pawns. Both tend to repel anyone or anything that tries to walk through them; it's also true that doors or holes can be created in both obstructions which allow a hu- man or a chess piece to pass safely to the other side. Chessically, this means that you should only attack an enemy unit or an area of enemy space if it is weak. Of course, these weaknesses will not just appear out of thin air. As the general who leads his pieces, your responsibility is to first create holes or targets in the enemy position and then to attack or surround these targets with your own army. In the Petrosian-Botvinnik game, White realized that he couldn't get to the weakness on e6, so he sought to create a target that's closer to home and therefore more accessible.

23.b4!

White makes use of the pin on the c-file and offers to trade his b-pawn for the enemy c-pawn. This exchange would turn the formerly solid c-pawn, well defended by the pawn on b6, into an isolated target that is very vulnerable to any form of persistent attack. This is how chess should be played. You create as many weak- nesses in the enemy camp as possible and then bring your pieces to bear on these targets. You may not be able to win anything right away, but your pieces will clearly be the aggressors while the enemy bits will be passively trying to hold onto life and limb.

creates an attack on the b4-pawn by the Black Bishop and Knight, keeps the White King out of d3 and tries to show that the Black c- pawn, now passed, is a strength rather than a weakness. Note that a holding pattern by 23...Rc7 would have left White in control after 24.bxc5 bxc5 25.Kd3 Don't forget that your King is a powerful piece and should be actively employed as soon as an endgame appears. 25-..Kf7 26.a5 (to keep the Black Knight off of b6) followed by Kc4 when the White pieces are dominating their Black counterparts and the Black pawn on c5 is in need of constant defense.

24.b5

This move places the White pawns on light-colored squares where they will be safe from the attentions of the Black Bishop.

24...Kf7?!

The Black King prepares to join the battle. It also gives sup- port to the weakened pawn on e6 in case a White piece even- tually manages to attack it. Later it was shown by Grandmaster Averbach that Black could have held the position by using the following active defense:

24...Ba3! 25.Rc2 c3! (sacrificing the pawn so that the Black Rook

can reach the White pawn on a4) 26,Bxc3 (26.Nxc3?? Nb4 traps the White Rook!) 26...Bb4 27.Kd2 (avoiding 27.Kd3?? Bxc3 28.Nxc3 Nb4+ forking White's King and Rook) 27...Rc4 28.Bxb4 (28.Kd3 Rxe4! wins material) 28...Rxe4 29.Bd6 Rxa4 (it seems to me that things are not so clear after 30.f3 Ra5 31.e4 Nf6 32.Rc8+ Kf7 33-Rc7+ when Black still has problems to solve). Notice how Black got out of his difficulties (if indeed he does get out of them!). He used his weak pawn to temporarily tie up the White pieces. This gave him enough time to begin his own attack against White's weak pawn on a4. Black suf- fered because he had a weak pawn and he saved himself be- cause he managed to get at a weak pawn in the White camp.

doesn't come into play in the popular cartoon series because the bird is much too fast to be caught. If we carry this state of affairs over to the chessboard, we begin to understand that a weak pawn is really only weak if it can be fixed in its position (moving targets are hard to hit) and then reached by members of the enemy army. T.Petrosian-B.Spassky, Moscow 1969 World Championship Match. I.c4 e6 2.d4 d5 3-Nf3 Be7 4,Nc3 Nf6 5.Bg5 O-O 6.e3 h6

7.Bxf6 Bxf6 8.Qd2 b6

We've reached a position from the early to middle stages of the opening. Many people feel that both sides should be getting their pieces developed before thoughts of any kind of plan begin to emerge. However, this is completely incorrect. In this position, Petrosian sees that Black has the two Bishops and would love to blow the center open with a ...c7-c5 advance. White would like to prevent this because, aside from stopping Black's plan, it would leave the pawn on c7 backward and potentially weak. If the Black c-pawn can't advance to c5 then no other pawn can protect it and it will always require a piece to act as its nurse- maid. If Black's b-pawn still stood on b7, Black could play ...c7- c6 when everything is solid and safe. With all these things in mind, White plays to stop the Black c- pawn in its tracks and create a target that may trouble Black later. White does intend to develop, but this will come after the more important question of the pawn stmcture has been addressed.

9.cxd5

This simple capture forces a Black pawn to permanently oc- cupy the d5-square. This is usually quite acceptable for Black since the d-pawn covers the important c4 and e4 squares. How- ever, in this case the immobile pawn on d5 has two shady aspects to it: 1) It will block Black's light-squared Bishop when it moves to its home on b7. 2) If Black ever plays ...c7-c5, White can cap- ture via dxc5 and create a discovered attack on the d5-pawm with his Knight and Queen.

9...exd5 10.b4

368 / THE REASSESS YOUR CHESS WORKBOOK

This gains queenside space and stops the Black c-pawn from moving to c5.

10...Bb7 ll.Rbl

This excellent move gets the Rook off the potentially danger- ous f6-al diagonal (a diagonal that could be ripped open if Black sacrificed a pawn with ...c7-c5), defends the b4-pawn, and com- pletely rules out ...c7-c5 because of bxc5 when the Rook is eye- ing Black's Bishop on b7.

11...c6 12.Bd3

Now that White has nipped Black's queenside expansion ideas in the bud, he finishes off his development.

12...Nd7 13.O-O Re8 14.Rfcl

The White Rook also finds a half-open file. On cl the Rook defends the c3-Knight and begins to stare in greedy fashion at the pawn on c6. It's important to note that White has not tried any kind of attack thus far. Instead, he has been content to gain a bit of queenside space, restrict the Black Bishops, create some poten- tial targets and develop his pieces to good squares where they can assist in placing pressure on the Black position. This style of play might surprise some of you when you real- ize that White virtually had to win this game if he wanted to retain any chances of keeping his title (which Spassky ultimately took from him in this match). Instead of throwing himself upon his opponent in a do-or-die effort, Petrosian calmly builds his posi- tion and waits for the right opportunity to present itself.

This position had been reached in an earlier game of this same match. In that instance, Petrosian answered with 15.a3 when

15...axb4 16.axb4 b5 followed by 17...Nb6 and 18...Nc4 created a

powerfully placed octopus which covered up the backward pawn on the c-file. 15-bxa5!

SOLUTIONS / SELF- ANNOTATIONS i 369

The prepared improvement which opens up lines for both White Rooks. Now the Black pawns on b6 and c6 come under pressure.

15...Rxa5

The White pawn on a2 is vulnerable but Black has two poten- tially weak units on c6 and b6. All the other White pawns are as solid as rocks.

16.Bf5

Threatening to win the b-pawn by Bxd7.

16...Ra6 17.Rb3

This prepares to double Rooks on the b-file, increasing the pressure against the Black pawns.

17...g6 18.Bd3

A tempting move that gains a tempo by attacking the Black Rook on a6. However, White no longer is placing pressure on the Black Knight, and after the game it was agreed that 18.Bh3 was somewhat superior to the move actually played.

18...Ra7 19.Rcbl

(281) Black to move and put up maximum resistance. 19-..Bg7 This was given a thumbs-down by critics. Do you see a better way for Black to place his pieces? How about 19...Kg7,

giving support to h6, followed by ...Be7-d6-c7 when Black's b- pawn is firmly defended. 2O.a4 This places the White a-pawn in a slightly more vulnerable position, but it also stops Black from ever entertaining ideas of a ...b6-b5 advance. This type of restrictive move was very typical of Petrosian. He loved to take away every possible active option from the oppo- nent. He preferred to strike when the enemy was drooling and helpless. Black now has a fairly solid but passive position.

20...Qe7 21.Bfl

Since Black is helpless, White takes his time and places his pieces on the safest possible squares. From fl this Bishop can go to h3 after g2-g3. It also frees the d3-square for a Knight.

21...Ba6?

Not good. Black gives up his Bishop pair (two Bishops have the potential to be strong. One Bishop is not so troublesome) and also leaves c6 without proper support.

22.h4

Suddenly White turns his attention to the kingside. Of course, if allowed he might create some weaknesses in that sector with h4-h5. His real intention, though, is to set up a firm kingside formation which will end any thoughts of Black kingside counterplay before continuing his queenside play. This setup will be achieved by g2-g3 and Kg2 when everything is solid and de- fended.

22...Bxfl 23-Rxfl h5 24.Rel

After this, Black must always take a possible e3-e4 advance into account.

24...Raa8 25.g3 Qd6 26.Kg2

Now the kingside light-squares and the f3-Knight are well defended.

26...KT8

Black can't see any way to improve his position so he begins to go back and forth in the hope that White won't be able to make any progress.

27.Rebl Kg8 28.Qdl BfS 29 R3b2 Bg7 3O.Rc2

After some boring cat and mouse play which serves to wear out the defending side, White turns his attention to that other weakness on c6.

30...Ra7 31.Rbcl Nb8 32.Ne2

This Knight is ultimately heading for d3 where it will eye the b4, c5 and e5 squares. Petrosian always took the time to ensure that every one of his pieces was placed at its best possible post.

33.Qd3 Ra7 34.Qb3 Ra6 35.Nf4 Rd8 36.Nd3 BfB 37.Nfe5

The pressure mounts on c6. Notice how Petrosian makes sure that every one of his pieces is doing a job. His King defends the holes on h3 and f3, his d3-Knight is ready to join the attack against c6 via Nb4, his e5-Knight is already bearing down on c6, his Queen attacks b6, eyes d5 and defends a4, and his Rooks both charge down the c-file and attack c6.

37...RC8 38.RC3 Be7 39.Nf4 Bf6 4O.Ned3

The threat of Nb4 is winning for White. Another method was 4O.Nxc6! Rxc6 41.Rxc6 Nxc6 42.Qb5 Nb8 43.Rc8+ Kg7 44.Rxb8.

40...Ra5 41.Qxb6

Simple and good was 41.Nb4, threatening to take advantage of the unprotected state of the c8-Rook by 42.Nbxd5. The move played by Petrosian begins a tactical sequence that utterly de- stroys the Black position.

Summary of the Imbalances and Ideas Viewed in this Game > Black gained the two Bishops but the central situation left them inactive. > Black's c-pawn is a long-term weakness. To keep it that way, White will stop it from advancing to c5 by pushing his b-pawn to b4. Remember: a moving target is hard to hit. Thus, stop it in its tracks and then batter away at it all day long. > You don't need to attack to win a game. A slow buildup that enables you to gain space and create enemy weaknesses is often extremely effective. > Black's 19...Bg7 was lazy, in that it didn't address the weaknesses on the queenside. He should have brought this Bishop over to c7 where it would have given b6 some firm support. > It's instructive to see how White always took time to ensure that all his pieces were placed on their very best squares.

sibility that would have led to her having doubled pawns. Looking at me as if I was demented, she said, 'Doubled pawns are always bad." Thinking about this, it struck me howT many beginner books and many deluded chess teachers pass on this inaccurate gospel from one generation to the next. Of course, doubled pawns can be bad, but they can also be a very positive addition to one's position. Deciding that I had to set things right, I immediately began to lecture Cindy about the more positive features of our doubled friends. I didn't really expect her to make use of this information for a long time since one little lesson is usually not nearly enough to change the bad habits of a lifetime. Imagine my surprise w hen, just a few days later, Cindy played the following game in which she made wonderful use of the plusses of doubled pawns. Cindy Tsai-S.Ananya, World Youth Festival, Brazil 1995. I.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bc4 Nf6 The Two Knights Defense. Black invites 4.Ng5 when great complications arise after 4...d5 5.exd5 Na5 6.Bb5+ c6 7.dxc6 bxc6 with a lead in development for the sacrificed pawn. Since Cindy didn't know the theory, she wisely avoided this path and quietly developed her pieces.

4.d3 Be7 5.O-O O-O 6.c3

A useful move that keeps the d4-square under control, thus ending any future threats based on ...Nd4. 6.c3 also prepares to gain central space with d3-d4.

6...d6 7.Rel Bg4 8.h3 Bh5 9 Nbd2

Starting a well-known maneuver that destroys the pin on the f3-Knight and brings the bl-Knight into contact with the juicy f5- square.

9...Re8 lO.Nfl a6

Taking the b5-square away from the White Bishop and pre- paring to surround it by ...Na5. ll.Ng3

374 / THE REASSESS YOUR CHESS WORKBOOK

A good move. However, if White wanted to retain her light- squared Bishop she could have tossed in H.Bb3 when ll...Na5 would be met by 12.Bc2.

12.Qxf3 Na5 13.Bg5!

A very fine move that has a couple of important points. First, White is happy to have her pawns doubled since these particular pawns add to her control of the center. Second, White has no intention of taking the Black Knight on f6. She is hoping that Black will play ...h6 when a Bishop retreat to e3 will show that the pawn on h6 is a weakness that is vulnerable to attack via Nf5. Advanced stuff from one so young!

13...Nxc4 14.dxc4

This is Cindy's first purposeful usage of doubled pawns and she is right on the mark! These doubled pawns control key squares on d5 and d4 and give the White Rooks a half-open d-file. Finally, nobody could possibly call these pawns weak; with b2-b3 the c4-pawn will be as solid as a rock. So what's wrong with these doubled pawns? The answer, obviously, is nothing!

14...Qd7?

Much better was 14...Nd7 (hoping to trade her bad Bishop for White's good one) 15.Be3 Bg5!. Another idea is 14...b5! 15.cxb5 axb5 when Black has weakened White's grip on d5 and has also opened the a-file for her Rook.

15.Nf5 Qe6 16.b3 Bd8?? 17.BB6!

This unexpected move forces the win of at least a pawn.

17...g6 18.Ng7 forks the Queen and e8-Rook.

18-Qg3+ Ng4 19.Qxg4+ Qg6 2O.Nxh6+ KfB 21.Nf5! White brings her Knight back to its wonderful post and allows Black to give her a new, and favorable, set of doubled pawns. The inferior 21.Qxg6? hxg6 would fix Black's pawns and would also deprive the White Knight of the f5~square.

SOLUTIONS / SELF-ANNOTATIONS / 375

21...Qxg4?

Black jumps at the change to give White more doubled pawns but this just makes White's position even stronger since now she will be able to make use of the half open h-file.

22.hxg4

The pawn on g4 gives White added control over f5 and h5.

22...Bg5 23.Radl

This excellent move places the Rook on a nice half-open file and also keeps the Black Bishop out of d2. Cindy is trying her best to deprive her opponent of any active play.

23...Rad8?

Correct was 23...b5! when 24.cxb5 axb5 gives Black counterplay against White's a2-pawn. Black's refusal to generate some play with ...b5, here or on subsequent moves, leads to her downfall. It's interesting to note that Black's only hope was to undouble White's c-pawns! Keep in mind that labeling something good or bad won't help you win games. Instead, create attackable targets in any and every way possible.

24.g3

This takes away the f4-square from the enemy Bishop and gives the White King a nice home on g2.

24...Rd7 25.Kg2 Red8 26.Rhl Kg8 27.Rh5

Attacking g5 and also preparing to double on the h-file. Note that all this play on the h-file is due to the doubled pawn on g4.

27...f6

Black defends her h7-pawn laterally with the Rook and also gives her Bishop the support it needs. 27...Bf6 would have lost quickly to 28.Rdhl.

376 / THE REASSESS YOUR CHESS WORKBOOK

(282) White to move and win.

28.Rhhl!!

The subtle point of White's play. By forcing ...f7-f6, White has taken away a route of retreat from the Black Bishop. White now intends to win the Bishop with Rhfl and f4. There is no defense against this threat. Note that 28.Rdfl? would have allowed the Bishop to escape with ...Bd2.

28...c6 29-Rhfl and White won a piece and the game. Learn

Everyone loves to sacrifice huge quantities of material for a nice mate. However, though we all find it satisfying to give up a couple of pieces or even our Queen, few of us know how to go about it in over-the-board play. Are the legendary combinations based on a mixture of talent and inspiration, or is some other factor at work? Tai, one of the greatest attacking geniuses in history, was once asked where the inspiration for all his combinative blows came from. He said, "Most certainly in the black coffee I drink before every game!" It turns out that most combinations, no matter their complex- ity or seeming originality, are based on a knowledge of tactical and combinative patterns. These patterns are picked up from iso- lated master games, being the whipping boy in countless blitz sessions and, more commonly, from books that discuss these things in great detail. In other words, with a little work it's remarkably easy to assimilate most of these tactical ideas. The first step is to convince the amateur that everyone can create a work of combinative art. EVERYONE! To prove this point, let's glance at a game played between two Class C players (1400- 1599) which actually won the tournament brilliancy prize ahead of several grandmasters and international masters. In fact, it was even used in a Russian book of great brilliancies! Catig-Mills, San Francisco 1974. I.e4 c5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3-d4 cxd4 4.Nxd4 g6 This line is known as the Accelerated Dragon.

The answer is shocking: Mills told me that he really wasn't able to calculate most of the variations; instead, he simply fol- lowed the advice given in Vukovic's book, The Art of Attack in Chess. It turns out that he was studying this book before the tournament. Having memorized the basic themes and patterns,

Everyone asks the same thing (if we discount the hate-mail), and nobody wants to deal with the answer when they get it. The question is, "How do I get better at chess?" The answer, short and to the point, is, "Hard work!" Sadly, the chessic equivalent to Viagra hasn't been invented yet, and chess-photosynthesis (holding a chess book to your head in the hope that the knowledge will seep into your skull) just

SOLUTIONS / SELF-ANNOTATIONS / 381

doesn't seem to work (I've tried!). Thus, we're left with long hours of study, strained eyes, and the weight of countless defeats rest- ing on our rapidly slumping shoulders. I'm constantly shocked by tournament players who, after twenty years in the trenches, still don't know what a support point (or any basic bit of chess knowledge) is. They all dream of making master, they all imagine themselves beating up on grand- masters, but, evidently, they think the skill is going to be inher- ited, or that Zeus will toss a lightening bolt their way filled with the combined chess knowledge of the last 300 years. To become a good chess player, you have to be willing to play, to lose (often!), and to work hard (very, very hard) at ironing out all the holes in your understanding. There are many ways to begin this journey: study openings and the typical middlegame plans that arise from the systems you wish to em- ploy; read any one of the many middlegame books that have flooded the market; pick up an endgame book and learn the basics in this phase of the game; look at annotated master games (always a good idea); and finally, find a chess teacher who will look at your own games and rip you apart (if you can't handle the criticism, may I suggest taking up solitaire?). Having a teacher look over your games is extremely useful. He can spot your overall shortcomings, he can patch your open- ings back together, and he can point out and mend bits of erroneous thinking you take with you to one game after an- other. Why repeat the same errors over and over again? Why not let a teacher surprise you as he fingers all the errors you've made in a game you felt was one of your very best? The twelve moves I had you look at might seem pedestrian, but they are actually filled with hard decisions, tension, and er- rors. This exercise will help you in the following ways: ♦ It will make my instructive comments much more personal, since you have already looked at the position and done your best to plumb its depths. ♦ It might show you where your weaknesses lie, since you can now compare your own observations with my own.

382 / THE REASSESS YOUR CHESS WORKBOOK

♦ It will whet your appetite for hard work during study (or it will make you swear never to attempt such an exhausting feat again, thereby destroying your chess future in the small space of one tiny problem!).

4 Having a teacher go over a game, or looking at

master notes after you've annotated the game yourself, often brings the moves to life in ways that you normally wouldn't experience. This enriches your understanding of chess strategy, and also allows you to embrace the human side of the game. You see its ups and downs, the psychologi- cal moments that often bridge the distance between victory and defeat, and the pathos that always comes with any creative/combative endeavor.

4 It might shock you to realize how much is going

on in a mere twelve moves! This, in turn, might convince you that there's a lot going on behind your back (and who wants to be oblivious to what's going on around them?). Now it's time to compare your notes with my own annotations. By the way, the players were both in the 1600-1700 range. I.e4 Nc6 If you are White, this might prove to be annoying. You've spent days going over the intricacies of the Lopez (l.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3-Bb5), you've destroyed your marriage by locking yourself in the garage with 50 books on the Sicilian (l.e4 c5), you've memo- rized the French Defense (l.e4 e6) until it's coming out of your ears, and you took time off from your job to work out antidotes against the solid Caro-Kann Defense (l.e4 c6), Alekhine's De- fense (l.e4 Nf6), and the Pirc Defense (l.e4 d6). Feeling empowered and ready for anything, you toss out l.e4 with a flick of your wrist and a deadly gleam in your eyes. And, horror of horrors, l...Nc6 appears on the board-a move that has clearly descended to Earth from some nether region of hell!

SOLUTIONS / SELF-ANNOTATIONS / 383

2.d4

This move follows a sane bit of advice: after playing l.e4, if your opponent lets you take the whole center with 2.d4, why not oblige? Well, 2.d4 can't be bad, of course. But let's take a look at the guy sitting across from us: when we played l.e4 he instantly banged down l...Nc6. When we looked at his face, a malicious death-grin leaped at us from the other side of the table, and a drop of saliva fell from the corner of his mouth onto his soiled shirt sleeve. What does all this mean? It tells us that he's either completely insane or that he is mirroring our own excitement over being completely prepared. In other words, while you were studying all those openings, he was devoting his life to the study and understanding of the positions arising after l.e4 Nc6 2.d4. With this in mind, is it really wise to walk into his prepara- tions? That's a decision only you can make, but most players (even at the grandmaster level) avoid any pre-studied lines by the opponent by simply replying with 2.Nf3. Then 2...d6 3.d4 se- verely cuts down on Black's options, and 2...e5 takes us back into familiar territory. It's as if the game went l.e4 e5 2,Nf3 Nc6.

2...e5

The alternative is 2...d5, but Black was still moving at break- neck speed and clearly had prepared this move before the game.

3.d5

An enormous decision! Theory recommends 3-dxe5 Nxe5

4.Nf3, but the text might seem better to many of you because it

annexes central space and hits the enemy Knight with gain of tempo. However, such a simplistic view isn't sufficient when de- ciding on this kind of advance. Instead, you have to look at the change in pawn structure and realize that the closed center, cre- ated by 3.d5, means that play on the wings will be called for. Was this apparent to you when you saw 3.d5? In a nutshell, White's pawns will be pointing towards the queenside (this gives him a spatial plus in that sector) and, as a result, that's where he should strive to open lines so that his

3M / THE REASSESS YOUR CHESS WORKBOOK

Rooks and other pieces can eventually penetrate into the hos- tile camp. This is usually done by a c2-c4-c5 advance. Black's pawns (c7-d6-e5) are pointing at the kingside, and he will strive to gain kingside space via ...Nce7 followed by ...d6 (in the game, he chooses an alternate plan), ...g6, ...Bg7 and an eventual ...f7-f5 advance. To sum up, White has to be confident that his queenside play is more real than Black's kingside play before he pushes his pawn to d5!

3...Nce7 4x4

White shows that he's aware of his queenside responsibilities! A move like 4.Nc3, though it looks "pretty," just develops and doesn't take any plan into account. Don't develop without a plan! If you liked 4.f4, did you take the negative factors of the move into consideration? After 4...exf4 5.Bxf4 Ng6 6.Bg3 d6 Black hopes to claim control over e5 and eventually place pressure against White's backward e-pawn by ...Bf8-e7-f6, ...Nh6, ...O-O, and ...Re8. You can't be aggressive just for the sake of aggression! If you saw all this and thought that ultimately you would win the fight for e5, then well and good. But if you didn't notice that you were creat- ing a weak square on e5 and a backward pawn on e4, then a weakness in your understanding of the game has been revealed and steps have to be taken to strengthen that area of your chess knowledge.

4...Ng6

I've already mentioned that 4...d6 followed by 5...g6, 6...Bg7,

7...Nf6 and 8...O-O, with an eventual ...f7-f5 to follow, leads to a

kind of position normally found in the King's Indian Defense. The move Black chose in the game makes perfect sense: he frees the f8-Bishop, intending to get it outside the pawn chain with ...Bc5 or ...Bb4, and places his Knight on a square where it threatens to leap into f4 at any moment.

5.Bd3

White had a lot of ideas here: 5.Be3 prevented Black from

SOLUTIONS / SELF-ANNOTATIONS / 385

placing his Bishop on c5; 5.g3 dominates the g6-Knigh( and even allows White to entertain ideas like h2-h4-h5. White's choice, though, is quite sensible. 5".Bb4+ Sharp. Black is trying to gain control over f4 and sees that

6.Bd2 Bxd2+ gets rid of White's main defender of that square

(though this is hardly bad for White!). Naturally, 5...Bc5 was a perfectly good alternative.

6.Nc3

Of course, 6.Bd2 was possible, as was the odd-looking 6.Nd2 Nf4 7.Bfl with g2-g3 to follow. White's choice gives Black a pos- sibility that both sides appear to ignore.

6...Nf6

I would have been very tempted to play 6...Bxc3+ 7.bxc3 d6, leaving White's pawn structure compromised and eventually al- lowing a Black Knight to take up residence on c5 via ...Ng8-f6-d7. In time, Black could also consider ...c7-c6, opening up the c-file so that the Black army could get within reach of White's c-file weaknesses. The striving for long-term structural plusses is a very impor- tant aspect of every master's game, but it's often overlooked by players who can't see beyond the world of simple threats and tactics.

7.Bd2

White decides to prevent the doubling of his pawns, but 7.Nge2 was a much better way to do this, guarding c3 and bringing an- other piece to bear on f4.

7...0.0 8.Nf3

Once again, I would have preferred 8.Nge2.

8...Bxc3?

Very odd. Instead of showing patience, Black decides that he can take the game by storm. Much better was the obvious 8...d6, freeing the c8-Bishop and giving e5 some much-needed support.

9-Bxc3 Nf4?? Losing the game, but this blunder allows us to take a look into the sordid world of chess psychology-Black tells White a lie and the first player buys into it! (284) Black pretends that he knows what he's doing. White to move.

10.O-O??

White said to himself, "If I capture on e5, he captures with check on g2. I can't allow that!" Sadly, the word "can't" should be eradicated from the vo- cabulary of every serious chess player. Instead, White should say, "What happens after 10.Bxe5 Nxg2+?" An unemotional look will convince you that ll.Kfl traps the Black Knight and leads to a winning game after ll...Ng4 12.Kxg2 (not 12,Bg3?? due to the fork on e3) 12,..Nxe5 13-Nxe5 Qg5+ 14.Ng4 h5 15.h3-

10...Nxd3?

And what is this about? Black has gone to extremes to get his Knight to f4, and now he voluntarily exchanges it for White's poor Bishop on d3. Once again, 10...d6 was called for. ll.Qxd3 d6 12.h3? Useless. White shouldn't fear ...Bg4 because his Knight isn't doing anything on f3 anyway! Instead of wasting time preventing a non-threat-Black's ...Bg4 can always be met by Nd2 when the Knight is ready to join its comrades on the queenside--White should continue his earlier plans (started with 4.c4) of queenside expansion by 12.b4, while an immediate 12.c5 advance is also very tempting.

5...cxd4?! White's bl-Knight will have access to the c3-square.

Why hand a square like that over to your opponent for no reason?

386 / THE REASSESS YOUR CHESS WORKBOOK

6.cxd4 Qb6

A normal move in the French that stops the cl-Bishop from developing. Black's Queen takes aim at b2 and adds to the pres- sure on d4.

7.Nc3 Nge7

Sensible. This Knight is headed for f5 where it will bring enor- mous pressure to bear against d4. It's important that all your pieces work together towards a unified goal. The Queen on b6, com- bined with Knights on c6 and f5, is a nice illustration of this concept.

8.Na4

White decides that the Queen has to be removed from its bothersome b6-perch. An important question now is: will the Knight be useful on a4?

8...Qd8 9.g4?

Bad. This pawn advance uses up an important move to ac- complish a rather nebulous weakening of the f4 and h4-squares. White has a strong center, and he should be doing everything possible to strengthen it. 9".Ng6?! This signifies an important moment. White has weakened his kingside with g2-g4 but also sent a message: he told Black that his intended ...Nf5 would not be tolerated. Black answers this with 9- .Ng6, giving up on his ...Nf5 idea once and for all. Why bow to White's wishes? Far more thematic in this kind of position is 9-.h5! when 10.h3 isn't possible due to 10...hxg4, making use of the pin along the h-file, while 10.gxh5 or 10.g5 cedes the f5-square to Black.

10.Bd2?

A horrible move. White is worried about the check on b4 and stops it by wasting a critical tempo to bring his Bishop to the passive d2-square.

SOLUTIONS / SELF-ANNOTATIONS / 389

Black finally begins to play with some energy. He has to generate counterplay against White's center, and ...f7-f6 hits it squarely in the face. Il.h4 White thinks he's attacking, and it soon becomes apparent that Black believes him! The first player has long ago abandoned all thoughts of defending his center.

11...fxe5 12.h5 Nge7

Rather odd. After twelve moves neither side has developed anything but Knights and pawns, unless you want to consider that hideous thing on d2 a developed piece!

13.dxe5 Bd7 14.Nc5

White tries to prove that the Knight on a4 is well placed by making another one-move threat. Naturally, Black diffuses this with ease.

14...Qc7

Defending b7 and continuing to increase the pressure against e5.

15.Ng5??

It's now clear that White doesn't know how to do anything but make one-move threats.

15...Nd4!

This is a good move that creates a discovered attack on c5 and defends the e6-pawn. White's pawn on e5 isn't going any- where since 16.Nd3 fails to 16...Nc2+.

16.RC1 Qxe5+ 17.Be3 Nec6

This calmly defends d4 and frees the f8-Bishop. White has been completely outplayed.

18.Nd3 Qf6 19.f4 Bd6 2O.Nf3 Nxf3+ 21.Qxf3 O-O-O?!

I would have preferred 21...O-O, instantly bringing the h8- Rook to a half-open file. Then 22.g5? is hammered by 22...Qxg5.

390 / THE REASSESS YOUR CHESS WORKBOOK

Black might also have considered 21. ..e5, ripping open the center in an effort to drag White's King to its knees. Black said that he didn't castle kingside because he felt it was walking into White's attack. Where, may I ask, is this mys- tery attack? Having some far-advanced pawns doesn't give White the right to claim an attack, and you shouldn't fear such shadows if you can give him a central slap. Remember that central play almost always beats play on the wings.

22.Bxa7 Bc7

(285) White to move. Black simply missed 22.Bxa7; fortunately, his reply, 22,..Bc7, is excellent. It unpins the Knight and creates an attack against a7. Now a Bishop move, 23-Be3, for example, is met by 23...e5! when Black's counterattack in the center is made all the stronger due to the White King's presence there. Black would then have a clear advantage. Summary of the Imbalances and Ideas Viewed in this Game > White built a central space advantage and then allowed Black to tear it down. Usually the player with the large center should do everything in his power to protect it. > Black's ability to blast open lines in the center should beat any wing action that White has in mind.

Black's disaster was caused by his failure to castle in an open position, and his failure to get his whole army involved in the game. Let's discuss these things in more detail. When we first learn how to play chess, we are told to develop our pieces as quickly as possible and get our Kings out of the center. A few of us follow this advice but many would-be champs don't understand why it is necessary to "waste time" moving all lhe men when they can go for the throat right away! To prove their point, they bring their Queen and Bishop out and go for a quick mate with just these two pieces. A typical example is l.e4 e5 2.Bc4 Nc6 3Qh5, threatening 4.Qxf7 mate. On occasion, these quick-fix attackers meet opponents who fall for these transparent threats. More commonly, though, we see the berserkers start to lose as they climb up the rating ladder or stand transfixed on the same rung of that ladder. Their flimsy two-piece attacks are pushed back with greater and greater fre- quency. Having no choice but to make some sort of adjustment (unless he enjoys being violently thrashed), the crazed berserker quiets down and begins to get a few more men out each game until he finally gives in to his original teacher's pleas. Why should we develop all our pieces and castle as quickly as pos- sible? Allow me to answer these two questions in as straightfor- ward a manner as possible.

392 / THE REASSESS YOUR CHESS WORKBOOK

WHY DEVELOP?

If you were starving on a desert island and knew that sixteen rabid trolls on the other side had copious quantities of hot fudge and ice-cream, would you challenge them alone, or would you create a large raiding party to even up the odds? If the answer to this question is as obvious as it appears to be, why is it that so many chess players insist on attacking sixteen chess pieces with just two of their own?

WHY CASTLE?

Was George Bush leading our troops down the sandy slopes of Iraq? Did Johnson or Nixon crawl through the steaming jungles of Vietnam? Of course not! Smart rulers stay in a safe place while their loyal subjects are battered into oblivion. Why is chess any different? On el or e8 the Kings get in the way of their Rooks and become fodder for the enemy pieces if central files get opened. Isn't it smarter to rush your monarch to a safe hiding place until the danger of a pitched battle subsides? Remember that a lost piece or two doesn't to prevent you from playing on. A lost King ends the game immediately, irrespective of the material or positional balance. In the game that follows, note how Black commits two hor- rible sins: He never moves his King-Bishop or King-Rook, and he never gets his King out of the center. Hopefully, Black's pain will prevent you from suffering in a similar manner. Paul Morphy-Duke of Brunswick (in consultation with • Count Isouard), Paris 1858 Philidor's Defense

1.e4 e5

2.Nf3 d6

This opening, called Philidor's Defense, has never been popular because it fails to develop a piece and restricts the action of the Black Bishop on f8. Most logical is 2...Nc6, a move that would defend e5, develop a piece, and continue the fight for the central d4-square.

3.d4

SOLUTIONS / SELF-ANNOTATIONS / 393

Morphy immediately gains central space and frees his Bishop on cl. He also prepares to open central files because he knows that an undeveloped opponent can best be punished in a wide open position-a position that has few or no central pawns. Why? Because the lack of central pawns gives Bishops free diagonals and Rooks open files. Don't forget that you can only overrun an unprepared enemy force by maximizing the activity of your pieces and by creating roads which allow your army to penetrate into the enemy position.

3...Bg4?

A poor move that allows White to acquire the two Bishops. Superior tries are 3-..Nf6, meeting the threat on e5 with a counter- attack against e4, or 3...exd4, a move that gains time by forcing White to spend a move to recapture his pawn.

4.dxe5!

Extremely unpleasant for Black. Normally this exchange of pawns would make Black happy because it frees the Bishop on f8. However, in this case Black is forced to capture on f3 and bring the White Queen to an aggressive post because 4...dxe5??

5.Qxd8+ (breaking the pin with tempo) 5...Kxd8 6.Nxe5 simply

leaves White with an extra pawn.

4...Bxf3

Not what Black wanted to do, but this is the only way to avoid the loss of material.

5.Qxf3

Most of us have heard that it's not a good idea to develop your Queen too early. This is because the enemy minor pieces can gain time by attacking it. Rules are made to be broken, though. A Queen is a very strong piece and if you can place it on a safe, active post then you should be happy to do so. Note the word safe: a Queen that is immune from the attack of enemy pieces and works in an aggressive manner with the rest of its army is a very valuable commodity. 5-dxe5

394 / THE REASSESS YOUR CHESS WORKBOOK

6.Bc4

This develops another piece and threatens a one-move mate on f7. I've often lectured students on the uselessness of a two- piece Queen and Bishop attack on f7. Why is this case any differ- ent? Though an obvious threat is useless by itself because the opponent will see it and take defensive measures to nullify your attack, in this case White is bringing his Bishop to a wonderful post. Thus, White isn't after the threat, he's just trying to place his pieces on their best squares. Note that an opening like l.e4 e5 2.Bc4 Nc6 3Qf3? is very different. The same mate is looming, but now White has created an obvious threat by placing his Queen on a poor post where it blocks the gl-Knight and is vulnerable to attack via ...Nc6-d4. In the Morphy game, the f3-Knight has already been developed so the Queen isn't blocking anything at all.

6...Nf6

Black develops his Knight and blocks the threat to f7 at the same time. Very commendable, but it falls victim to a bother- some double attack against f7 and b7 because the early devel- opment of the c8-Bishop took away the b7-pawn's natural pro- tector. Better was 6...Qd7.

7.Qb3!

Hitting both b7 and f7.

7...Qe7

The best of a bad deal. This defends f7 and intends to trade Queens after 8.Qxb7 Qb4+, though White would be a solid pawn up with a winning game.

8.Nc3

Morphy decides to ignore the win of a "lowly" pawn. I must admit that I would probably have eaten that b7-pawn with glee and happily gone into the pawn-up endgame. In fact, the strong 8.Bxf7+ Qxf7 9.Qxb7 would have been hard to resist. Instead, Morphy keeps developing his forces in an attempt to highlight his advan- tage in development and crush Black as quickly as possible.

SOLUTIONS / SELF-ANNOTATIONS / 395

8...c6

This keeps the White pieces out of b5 and d5 and it also allows the Black Queen to protect both b7 and f7.

9.Bg5

White develops his final minor piece and prepares to castle. Notice how White's lead in development is getting greater with each passing move.

9...b5?

This move turns a terrible position into a resignable one. While Black's desire to chase the powerful White Bishop to a less active square is easy to understand, it is rarely correct to lunge forward when you are already off balance. 9...Qc7 followed by the devel- opment of the f8-Bishop made more sense.

10.Nxb5!

Seeing that he is way up in development and also seeing that the Black King is doomed to remain in the center for the rest of the game, White is willing to do almost anything to open lines of attack so that his pieces can reach the enemy King. Remember that a lead in development becomes more and more potent as the position becomes more and more open.

10...cxb5

11.Bxb5+ Nbd7

12.O-O-O

Getting the White King to safety' and bringing a Rook to the open d-file. Now the two pinned Knights on d7 and f6 are under tremendous pressure and the Black position is starting to creak and groan. Of course, White is a piece down, but this is more illusion than reality because the inactive state of the Black pieces on f8 and d8 give White a superior working force. This means that White is, in effect, material ahead-he has five attacking units (two Bishops, two Rooks, and a Queen) to Black's four defen- sive units (two Bishops, two Knights, and the Rook on a8).

12....Rd8

396 / THE REASSESS YOUR CHESS WORKBOOK

White threatened to win material by taking on either d7 or f6. This move gives the d7-Knight some much-needed support. (286) White to move and win. 13Rxd7! White must strike while the iron is hot or Black will bring his remaining forces out with ...Qb4 followed by ...Be7. Never forget that a lead in development is not a permanent advantage. If you don't make immediate use of your mobilized army, the opponent will eventually bring his own pieces out and catch up. This sacrifice of the White Rook makes room for the other Rook and does not give Black the opportunity to carry out any of his own plans.

13...Rxd7

14.Rdl

Throwing his final piece into the attack and bringing more pressure to bear against d7. Black could safely resign here but instead he allows a very pretty finish.

A bad idea. White's d-pawn now comes under a lot of pres- sure. The solid 10.c3 was still very nice for White, leaving Black with nothing to attack in White's camp. It's important that you always be aware of your weakest points and take steps to fix them.

10...0.0 ll.Qd2 Bf6 12.Ne2 Nd6

Black begins to show an unfortunate preference for useless one-move attacks, and though there's nothing wrong with this move, I suspect his idea behind it was way off. I doubt that he noticed the potential weakness of d4 and b2. He was wise to avoid 12,..Ncxd4? 13-Nexd4 Nxd4 14.Nxd4 Qb6 since 15.Be3 Bxd4 16.Bxd4 Qxb5 17.Rael gives White strong pressure on the dark squares for the sacrificed pawn. Note that

17.Qg5? f6 18.Rxf6?? loses to 18...Rxf6 l$>.Bxf6 Qb6+.

13.Bd3?

White also seems to be unaware of the problems brewing on d4. 13-Ne4 Another good move, but not played for the right reason.

14.Qel

White didn't like the look of 14.Qcl Nb4.

14...Re8?

SOLUTIONS / SELF-ANNOTATIONS / 403

Missing his chance. If he had been aware of the weak- nesses on b2 and d4, he would have had no problem finding

14...Qb6, hitting both targets at the same time.

15x3 White finally manages to tighten his pawn chain, and the ad- vantage slowly shifts back to its rightful place.

15."a6?

I think Black was confused. He should have kept life and limb together with the solid 15...Bf5 16.Qbl Bg6.

16.Qbl Na5?

It still wasn't too late for 16...Bf5, fortifying both e4 and the kingside.

17.Ng3 Nxg3 18.Bxg3?

White becomes lazy. He saw 18.Bxh7+, but thought that Black intended to trap him with 18...Kh8 19.hxg3 g6. A serious look would have convinced him that 2O.Bxg6 fxg6 21.Qxg6 with the threat of 22.Kf2 and 23-Rhl+ would have given him a crushing attack.

18...h6 19.Be5 Be6

(289) White to move and win. 2O.Qc2?? Missing a chance to score a pretty victory. Correct wras 2O.Bxf6 Qxf6 21.Bh7+! (there is our "Petrosian" check! Of course,

Still allowing 21.Bxf6 followed by 22.Bh7+l.

And the unseen chance vanishes forever. The rest of the game saw White, after various errors, achieve a dead won endgame only to make a blunder so bad that it thins the blood and brings a scream of anguish to one's lips.

Summary of the Imbalances and Ideas Viewed in this Game > The study of master games plays a key part in any serious student's chess development. > The old saying, "Always check, it might be mate." shouldn't be taken too seriously. However, every check does need to be examined. Hopefully, the possibility of Bh7+ will now become a part of your chess armament. > Don't place your pieces on undefended squares. > Avoid useless one-move attacks! Instead, learn to train your sights on the opponent's structural weaknesses. Active An aggressive move, line of play, or position. When mentioned in terms of a player's style, it denotes a pref- erence for sharp, tactical or vibrant types of play. Advantage Having a superiority in position based on a particular imbalance or series of imbalances. See Im- balance. Analysis The calculation of a series of moves in a given position. This can be done in actual tournament condi- tions (in which you are not allowed to touch the pieces) or in a calmer scenario in which the pieces can be moved about (such analysis is often written down for future study or reference). The purpose of analysis is to discover the best move or plan. There is no limit to its length. Annotation Written comments (prose, chess symbols or actual moves) about a position or game. Attack To make a threat or threats against a specific piece or area of the board. Backward Pawn A pawn that has fallen behind its comrades, and thus no longer can be sup- ported or guarded by other pawns of its own persuasion. In the diagram, Black has backward pawns at d6 and f7. The pawns on h6 and b7 are not backward because they can safely advance.

408 / THE REASSESS YOUR CHESS WORKBOOK

Bind To have such a vise-like grip on a position that useful moves are difficult for the opponent to find. One often speaks of a crushing space advantage as a bind. The diagram shows an ex- treme example of a bind; Black is bound hand and foot and can un- dertake nothing positive at all. Bisbop Pair To possess two Bishops versus the opponent's Bishop and Knight or two Knights. Two Bishops work extremely well to- gether and are usually an advantage in open positions. Bishops of Opposite Color A situation in which each player has only one Bishop, each being of a different color, and thus the Bishops can never come into contact. This is usually a good attacking imbal- ance for the middlegame, since one can't defend what the other attacks. However, these Bishops are known to be rather drawish in the endgame, due to the fact that the defender can place his pawns and King on the opposite color of the enemy Bishop, whereupon they are impervious to harm. From an attacking point of view, a general rule for Bishops of oppo- site colors is that they are at their best with other pieces to back them up. On their own, they are often impotent. Blockade Conceptualized and popu- larized by Aron Nimzovich (1886-1935), it refers to the tying down or immobilization of an enemy pawn by placing a piece, particularly a Knight, directly in front of it. In the diagram, the Knight on d6 is blockading the pawn on d5. Blunder A horrible mistake that hangs material or makes enormous positional or tactical concessions. Book Published opening theory. A "book player" is one who relies on memorization of published analysis rather than on his own creative imagination. "Taking someone out of book," refers to sidestepping published analysis by playing a new or unorthodox move. This denies him the chance to make use of a good memory and forces him to find good moves on his own.

GLOSSARY / 409

Break The gaining of space (and thus more freedom of movement) by the advance of a pawn. In the diagram, White intends to open lines of attack on the queenside by the break c4-c5, pre- pared by b2-b4. Black will strive to attack White on the kingside by a ...f7-f5 break. Breakthrough A means of penetrating the enemy position. This can be accomplished by a pawn break or by a sacrifice involving pieces or pawns. In the diagram, both sides are attacking each other's King. At the moment White is safe, since ...gxf3 can be safely answered by Bxf3. So White uses the time given him to effect a breakthrough on the queenside by l.bxc5 dxc5 2.Nxc5! bxc5. If Black does not capture the Knight, White will simply retreat it to d3 and rip Black open by c4- c5, Qb2 and Black will be mated. White to play. Brilliancy A game that contains a very deep strategic concept, a beau- tiful combination or an original plan. Calculation The working out of variations without moving the pieces physically. Though this book has taught you to talk or reason your way through a game, there are many positions that have a purely tactical nature. In such situations, the player's ability to calculate variations accurately takes on great importance. The way to train your combinative (calculative) vision is to study the games of attacking players like Alekhine, Tai, or Kasparov. Fol- low their opening moves and then cover up the rest of the game score. At this point you should endeavor to figure out all the imbal- ances, the plans, candidate moves, etc. When this is done, calculate each candidate move as deeply as you can, writing down all this information as you go. All these things must be done without mov- ing the pieces around. When you have done all that's possible (take as much time as you need, we are looking for accuracy; speed will follow with practice), look at the move played, make it on your board and keep repeating the process until the game is complete.

Center Usually considered to be the e4-, d4-, e5-, and d5-squares, though the territory within the c4-, c5-, f4-, and f5-parameters can also be thought of as central. Centralize The central placing of pieces and pawns so they both con- trol the center and extend their influence over other areas of the board. A piece will usually reach maximum maneuverability and power when centrally placed. Checkmate See Mate. Classical A style of play, sometimes called a school, that is concerned with forming a full pawn center. The strategic concepts that go with it tend to be viewed as ultimate laws and thus are rather dogmatic. A classical opening is an opening based on these views. See Hypermodern. Closed Game A position locked by pawns. Such a position tends to lessen the strength of Bishops and other long-range pieces simply because the pawns get in their way. Knights, not being long-range pieces, can jump over other pieces and pawns and thus are very useful in such closed situations. A typical series of opening moves that leads to a closed position is l.d4 Nf6 2.c4 c5 3-d5 e5 4.Nc3 d6 5.e4, etc. Combination A tactical move or series of moves based on the opponent's weakened King, hanging or undefended pieces or inadequately guarded pieces. Usually involving a sacrifice, it is a calculable series of moves leading to material or positional gains. It is important to note that a combination cannot exist if at least one of the above factors is not present. • Though several players have attempted to create a clear defini- tion throughout the years, the following definition by Silman and Seirawan is the most accurate: "A combination is a sacrifice, com- bined with a forced sequence of moves, that exploits specific pecu- liarities of the position in the hope of attaining a certain goal." Compensation An equivalent advantage in one imbalance that bal- ances the opponent's advantage in another. For example: material versus development or space versus a superior minor piece or three pawns versus a Bishop. Connected Passed Pawns Two or more pawns of the same color on adjacent files. See Passed Pawn. Control To dominate or have the sole use of a file, a square or group of squares, an area of the board, etc. Having the initiative would also put one in "control."

GLOSSARY / 411

Counterplay When the defending side starts his own aggressive ac- tion, he is said to have or be initiating counterplay. However, there are varying degrees of counterplay-some equalizing the chances, some not being quite adequate and some leading to the capture of the initiative and subsequently an advantage. Cramp A disadvantage in space that leads to a lack of mobility. Critical Position That point in a game when the evaluation will clearly turn to one side's advantage or stabilize down to equality. In such a position the scales are delicately balanced and the slightest error can lead to disaster. Defense A move or plan designed to meet an enemy's attack or threats. It is also used in the names of various opening initiated from the Black side. For example: Petroff Defense, Caro-Kann Defense, etc. These Black systems are called defenses since White has the first move and thus Black is considered to be defending. The usual flow from Black's point of view would be: defense leading to equaliza- tion followed, only then, by the switch over to a counterattack. This is the classical approach. More modern openings are often designed to create immediate imbalances in an effort to s eize the initiative as Black. Strange as it may seem, even these counterattacking open- ings are usually given the title of defenses: Nimzo-Indian Defense, Sicilian Defense, Grunfeld Defense, King's Indian Defense, etc. Development The process of moving one's pieces from their starting posts to new positions where their activity and mobility are enhanced. It must be remembered that one's pieces should be developed to squares where they work with the rest of their army towards a par- ticular goal. If an individual piece is providing a useful service on its original square, then there may be no reason to move it. Doubled Pawns Two pawns of the same color lined up on a file as the result of a capture. Such pawns are generally considered to be weak, though quite often their ability to control certain squares makes them very useful. The diagram shows doubled pawns in a favorable light. The doubled pawn on c3 is guarding the critical d4-square, while the other pawn on c4 increases White's control over the important d5- square. Also note how doubled

412 7 THE REASSESS YOUR CHESS WORKBOOK

. i pawns give their owner an extra file to use. Black's position in die diagram would be considerably improved if he could double his own pawns by placing the d6-pawn on e6. Dynamic The word "dynamic" symbolizes the aggressive potential in any given position or move. ; Elo Rating A mathematical system, now used, worldwide, devised by Professor Arpad Elo to rank chess players. En Passant A French term that literally means "in passing." When a pawn advances two squares (somediing it can only do if it has not yet moved) and passes an enemy pawn on an adjacent file that has advanced to its fifth rank, it may be captured by that enemy pawn J as if the advancing pawn had moved only one square. This op- tional capture may be made only on the first opportunity else the i right is permanendy lost. ,, In die diagram, if Black plays I...c7-c5, White, if he wishes, may capture the pawn as if it had moved to c6. Thus, 2,dxc6. If after

1...c7-c5 White declines to capture and instead plays 2.c4, dien after

2...e7-e5 White could no longer capture the c5-pawn. However, he

could capture the e5-pawn by dxe6 if he so desired. In chess nota- tion an En Passant capture is labeled by die letter e.p. En Prise A French term meaning "in take." It describes a piece or pawn that is unprotected and exposed to capture. Endgame When most of the pieces have been exchanged, usually leaving bodi sides with one to diree pieces each (plus any amount

[diagram]
as the endgame. "' ' < . i Equality A situation in which neither side has an advantage. Exchange To trade pieces of equal worth. See Point Count. Trading a - piece for something of lesser value is called a Blunder or a Sacrifice. Exchange, The A comparison of value between a Rook versus a Bishop ; or Knight. Thus, if you have won an enemy Rook for your Bishop, you have won the Exchange.

GLOSSARY / 413

Fianchetto An Italian word meaning "on the flank." Though you will hear many different pronunciations, the correct is fee-an-keMo. When a Bishop is developed on QN2 or KN 2 (b2 or g2 for White and b7 or g7 for Black), it is called a fianchetloed Bishop. This term applies only to Bishops. FIDE An acronym for Federation Internationale des Echecs, lhe World Chess Federation. File A column of eight squares. An open file is a file that is not blocked by either side's pawns. Fish A derogatory term denoting a weak chess player. Flank The sides of the board-lhe kingside and queenside. Flank Open ings are openings that deal with flank development. Typical starts for such systems are l.c4, l.Nf3, l.b3, Lg3, etc. Force All pieces and pawns are units of force. For example, if Whit'' has four attacking units on the kingside to Black's two, White is ."ui<1 to have an advantage in force in that sector of the board. Forced A move or series of moves that must be played if disaster is to be avoided. Two examples: 1) You face a forced move when your checked King only has one legal move to get out of check. 2) A Knight or any other piece is attacked and has only one safe square to go to. Moving it to that safe square is also considered to be forced, even though other moves could legally be played. Gambit A voluntary sacrifice of a pawn or a piece in the opening with the idea of gaining the initiative, a lead in development or some other compensating factor. General Principles Basic rules of play designed to serve as guidelines for less advanced players. As one's experience grows, one learns that rules are meant to l>e broken. For example: the old rule of "always capture with a pawn towards the center," is widely fol- lowed, but a good 30% of the time it is correct to capture away from lhe center. Other rules such as, "avoid doubled pawns," "castle as early as possible," "develop Knights before Bishops," etc., are also just as suspect. The simple fact is that every situation must be looked at with an open mind. Dogma is not something to be nurtured in life or in chess. Ghosts Threats that exist only in your own mind. A fear of your oppo- nent or a lack of confidence will often lead to the appearance of ghosts and the cropping up of blunders in your play.

Grandmaster The highest chess title, aside from World Champion, that one can achieve. Conferred by FIDE, it is awarded to players who meet established performance standards. Other titles, in order of importance, are International Master and FIDE Master. Once earned, these titles cannot be taken away. Grandmaster Draw This label, originally used to describe a quick, uninteresting draw between grandmasters, is now employed to de- scribe a fast draw between virtually any class of players. Hack A derogatory chess term meaning a state of chess ineptitude. Hanging An unprotected piece or pawn exposed to capture is said to be hanging. Hanging Pawns Two adjacent friendly pawns on their fourth rank, separated from other friendly pawns, and subject to frontal attack on two half-open files. Though often objects of attack, they also pos- sess a certain dynamic potential. Thus, the battle rages around the question, "are they strong or weak?" The diagram shows a common hanging pawns situation. The hanging pawns on c5 and d5 give Black an edge in space, good con- trol of the central squares and pres- sure down the half open b-file. However, they are also exposed to attack. Mog See Pig. Hold A defensive term meaning to "hang on." "Such and such a move would have held out longer," means that the move would have offered tougher resistance, but would most likely have ultimately failed. "Such and such a move would hold," means that the men- tioned move would have allowed a successful defense. Hole A square that cannot be defended by pawns. Such a square makes an excellent home for enemy pieces, especially Knights. For ex- ample, the opening l.c4 c5 2.Nc3 Nc6 3.e4 is playable, but leaves a hole on d4 that, after 3 --g6 and 4...Bg7, can easily be used by a Black piece. Hutch A special room set aside for players in a tournament to analyze their games and play skittles. Such a room allows various kinds of

GLOSSARY / 415

activity to go on without disturbing the unfinished games in the tournament. Usually used by the non-masters (called Rabbits), the term hutch becomes easily understandable. See Rabbit and Skittles. Hypermodern A school of thought that insists that indirect control of the center is better than direct occupation. In particular, Reti and Nimzovich successfully propagated the idea of central control from the flanks. Unfortunately, they took their ideas to extremes, just as the classicists did. Today it is recognized that both schools of thought are partially correct, and a blending of the two is the only truly balanced method. Imbalance Any difference between the White and Black positions. Material advantage, superior pawn structure, superior minor piece, space, development, and the initiative are all typical imbalances. Initiative When your opponent is defending and you are attacking or putting pressure on him, it is said that you have the initiative. Innovation k new move in an established position or opening. Intuitive Usually a sign of experience, it enables a player to choose a move or plan by feel or common sense as opposed to detailed analysis. Isolated Pawn A pawn with no friendly pawns on either adjacent file. A common opening that allows an isolated pawn is l.e4 e6 2.d4 d5

3.Nd2 c5 4.exd5 exd5 5.Ngf3 Nc6 6.Bb5 Bd6 7.dxc5 Bxc5 8.O-O Nge7

9.Nb3 Bd6 10.Nbd4. The negatives of an isolated pawn are its inabil-

ity to be guarded by a friendly pawn and the fact that the square directly in front of it usually makes a fine home for an enemy piece since no pawns can chase it away. On the positive side, it offers plenty of space and the use of two half-open or open files on either side of it, with the result that one's pieces usually become active. Kingside The half of the board originally occupied by the King, K- Bishop. K-Knight and K-Rook. The kingside is on the right of the player with the White pieces and on the left of the player with the Black pieces. Liquidation A series of exchanges that are initiated to quell an enemy attack or to trade off to a drawn or won endgame. Luft Literally meaning "air." In chess it describes a pawn move in front of one's King that prevents back rank mate possibilities. Major Pieces Also called heavy pieces. The term applies to Queens and Rooks. See Minor Pieces and Pawns.

416 / THE REASSESS YOUR CHESS WORKBOOK

Maneuver A series of quiet moves that aim to favorably reposition one's pieces. Master A player becomes a master when he reaches an Elo rating of 2200, though he will lose this title if his rating drops below that point. Mate Short for checkmate. It means that you are threatening to capture the enemy King and nothing your opponent can do will prevent its loss. When this happens, you have won the game. Material The pieces and pawns, excluding the King. A material advan- tage is obtained by winning a piece of greater value than the one you gave up. For example, giving up a pawn to win a Rook means that you have an advantage in material. Mating Attack An attack on the King that is expected to lead to a checkmate. Middlegame The phase of the game that sits between the opening and the endgame. Subtle plans and exciting attacks are generally seen in the confines of the middlegame. Grandmaster Tarrasch once said, "Between the opening and the endgame, the gods have placed the middlegame." Minor Pieces The Bishops and the Knights. Minority Attack A plan based on the use of two or more pawns (the minority) to act as battering rams against the opponent's three or more pawns (the majority) in order to create a weakness in the opposing camp. Here is the most common opening sequence by which a minor- ity attack is reached: l.d4 d5 2.c4 e6 3-Nc3 Nf6 4.Bg5 Be7 5.cxd5 exd5 6.Nf3 O-O 7.e3 c6 8,Bd3 Nbd7 9.Qc2 Re8 10.O-O Nf8 ll.Bxf6 Bxf6 12.b4 Be7 13-b5 Bd6 14.bxc6 bxc6. White has carried out his minority attack and has left Black with a weak pawn on c6 and a weak square on c5. After a further Rfcl, Rabi and Na4, White will have great pressure against Black's queenside. This plan is very important to understand, and situations for its use constantly arise. Mobility To have freedom of movement for one's pieces. Mysterious Rook Move A move with a Rook that seems to have no threat or purpose, but which actually discourages the opponent from a certain type of action (see Prophylaxis), or sets up a very deep, wrell-concealed plan.

GLOSSARY / 417

Occupation When a Rook or Queen controls a file or rank, that file or rank is said to be occupied. Occupation of a square occurs when a piece is safely placed upon it. Open A type of position (see Open Game) or file (see Open File). This term also refers to a type of tournament in wThich any class of player can participate. Though a player often ends up with opponents who are much higher or lower rated than himself, the prizes are usually structured around classes and, for this reason, opens are attractive to players of every rating. The open tournament is extremely popular in the United States and is beginning to be seen more and more in Europe. Open File A column of eight squares that is free of pawns. It is on open files (and ranks) that Rooks come to their maximum potential. Open Game A type of position that is characterized by many open lines and few center pawns. A lead in development becomes very impor- tant in positions of this type. Opening The beginning phase of a game. This usually encompasses the first dozen moves but it can easily go much further. It is often written that the main opening objectives are: 1) develop your pieces in a quick and efficient manner; 2) occupy as much of the center as possible; 3) castle early (King safety). While I can say that these objectives are basically correct, the real purpose of the opening is to create an imbalance and develop your pieces in such a way that they all work together in making the imbalance a favorable attribute. Opposition In the endgame, a fight between Kings often occurs that ultimately determines which one is stronger. This face-off between the two monarchs is known as the opposition. Outflanking An endgame maneuver with Kings wrhich makes forward progress on the board while: 1) Simultaneously preventing your opponent from taking direct opposition; or 2) Temporarily giving up the opposition for a higher goal. Overextended When a player tries to gain some advantages by starting a major advance or offensive, and then this offensive fails, he is often left with various weaknesses and nothing to compensate for them. His position is then said to be overextended.

418 / THE REASSESS YOUR CHESS WORKBOOK

Overprotection A term coined by Nimzovich. It refers to defending a strong point more times than appears necessary. The idea is that a certain pawn or square may be causing the opponent considerable problems. When the overprotector focuses the energy of several pieces on it, the opponent would be unwise to break that point because that would unleash the latent energy of the overprotector's army. In the diagram, White is overprotecting the e5-pawn. The rea- son for this is that the e5-pawn spearheads a kingside attack by White. Normally Black might wish to close lines there by ...f7-f5, but now White would answer this and ...f7-f6 with exf6 when all of his pieces have increased their scope and have become extremely active. Thus Black is unable to do anything that would allow White to remove the e5-pawn. As a consequence, his defensive resources are greatly reduced. Also see Prophylaxis. Passed Pawn A pawn that has passed by all enemy pawns capable of capturing it. In the diagram, White has con- nected passed pawns on g5 and h6. Black has a passed pawn on a7 and a protected passed pawn on e4. Passive An inactive move that does nothing to fight for the initiative. A passive position is a position without counterplay or active possibilities. Patzer A derogatory term that denotes a hopelessly weak player. Pawn The least valuable unit of force in a chess game. Pawns are not considered to be pieces, they are simply called pawns. Pawn Center Pawns placed in the center. White pawns on f4, e4 and d4, for example, would constitute a large pawn center. A common opening that allows White to build such a center, with Black hoping to attack it later, is l.e4 d6 2.d4 Nf6 3-Nc3 g6 4.f4, etc. Pawn Chain Two or more like-colored pawns linked diagonally. The weakest point of a pawn chain is the base because that is the one pawn in the chain that cannot be defended by another pawn.

GLOSSARY / 419

Pawn Island A group of connected friendly pawns. In the diagram, Black has three pawn islands to White's two. It is usually consid- ered to be advantageous to have fewer pawn islands than the opponent. Pawn Structure The positioning of rhe whole pawn mass. Also re ferred to as the pawn skeleton. This positioning of the pawns is what usually dictates the types of plans available in a given position due to open files, space, pawn weaknesses, etc. Pig A slang for Rook. ' Pigs on the seventh" is a common term for Rooks doubled on the seventh rank. Also known as "Hogs on the seventh." Plan A short or long-range goal on which a player bases his moves. Point Count A system of figuring out the worth of the pieces by giving each of them a numerical value. King = priceless; Queen = 9 points; Rook = 5 points; Bishop = 3 points; Knight - 3 points; pawn = 1 point. The flaw in the system is that it does not take into account other factors such as position, tactics, etc., that often drastically change the relative value of an individual piece. Poisoned Pawn Any pawn that, if captured, would lead to serious disadvantage is considered to be poisoned. Positional A move, a maneuver or a style of play that is based on an exploitation of small advantages. Post Mortem A Latin term borrowed from medicine that literally means, "after death." In chess it refers to the sessions that often take place after a tournament game has finished. Both players discuss the game and attempt to find the reason why someone lost-the "cause of death. In particular, those with huge or delicate egos love post mortems because they can show that they saw much more than the opponent, who was undoubtedly lucky to gain the victory. For those of a more open nature, if you have played a stronger player than yourself, you can sit back, ask what you did wrong and hope that the mysteries of the universe will unfold. Premature A hasty move, maneuver or plan-to take action without sufficient preparation.

420 / THE REASSESS YOUR CHESS WORKBOOK

Prepared Variation A deeply researched opening variation that is often strengthened by new moves. It is a common practice to pre- pare certain lines and new moves for particular opponents, refusing to use it against anyone other than its intended victim. Problem Child A reference to a Queen's Bishop that is trapped behind its pawns. For example, the French Defense (l.e4 e6 2.d4 d5) is an attractive opening. Its one flaw is the Queen's Bishop, which is blocked by its own pawns and unable to reach an active square. Prophylactic Move See Prophylaxis. Prophylaxis A strategy explored by Nimzovich. Taken from the Greek word prophylaktikos, meaning to guard or prevent beforehand, pro- phylaxis (or a prophylactic move) stops the opponent from taking action in a certain area for fear of some type of reprisal. Overprotec- tion is a form of prophylaxis. Promotion Also called Queening. When a pawn reaches the final rank it's usually turned into a Queen. However, the pawn can be pro- moted into a Bishop, Knight, or Rook (it cannot be turned into a King). When a pawn is turned into something other than a Queen, the pawn is said to have underpromoted. Protected Passed Pawn A passed pawn that is protected by a friendly pawn. See Passed Pawn. Queening See Promotion. Queenside That half of the board made up of the four files originally occupied by the Queen, Q-Bishop, Q-Knight and Q-Rook. The queenside stands to White's left and Black's right. Quiet Move A move that is neither a capture, a check, nor a direct attack. Rabbit A humorous (slightly insulting) term for a non-master. Rank A horizontal row of eight squares. The seventh rank in particular is the subject of much activity, especially when a Rook settles there. Control of the seventh rank is considered to be an important advantage. Rating See Elo Rating. Refutation A move or series of moves that demonstrates a flaw in a game, move, variation, analysis, or plan.

GLOSSARY / 421

Resigns Realizing the hopeless nature of a position and not wanting to insult the intelligence of the opponent, a player can surrender the game-resign-without having to wait for a checkmate. Resignation occurs in the vast majority7 of tournament games. Actual checkmates are quite rare. Risk A double-edged sword. A move, plan or opening variation that aims for advantage while carrying the danger of a disadvantage. Romantic The romantic era (macho-era) of chess was a time when sacrificing and attacking was considered to be the only manly way to play. If a sacrifice was offered, it was a disgraceful show7 of cow- ardice to refuse; thus, many beautiful sacrificial games were recorded simply because proper defensive techniques were not understood. That w as in the 1800's. Today, a player wfio is termed romantic is one w ho has a proclivity for bold attacks and sacrifices, often thrcw- ing caution to the wands. Sacrifice The voluntary offer of material for the purpose of gaining a more favorable advantage than the material investment. Unlike a combination, a sacrifice is not a cut-and-dried affair. There is usually an element of uncertainty associated with it. Though a combination always has one or more sacrifices, a sacrifice need not be associated with a combination. Semi-Open Game A position with some closed and some open quali- ties. Typically, l.e4 e6, l.e4 c6 and l.e4 d6 lead to semi-open games. See Open Games and Closed Games. Sharp A bold, aggressive move or position. A sharp player is one who enjoys dynamic, explosive situations. Shot A .strong move that the opponent didn't expect. Simplify An exchange of pieces to reach a w on ending, to neutralize an enemy attack or simply to clarify a situation. Skittles Chess played in an offhand manner, often at a chess club or after a tournament game. Sound An analytically correct move or plan. A safe, solid position. Space The territory controlled by each player. Thus, whoever controls the most territory has a spatial advantage. Speculative An unclear or risky7 move or plan.

422 / THE REASSi S YOUR CHESS WORKBOOK

Strategy The foundation of a players moves. The way to achieve a particular plan. See Plan. Style The preference for certain types of positions and moves. It is typical to have one player who enjoys open, tactical positions while his opponent may cherish semi-closed structures of a positional na- ture. Thus, the first part of the battle will be to determine who gets the type of position at which he excels. Support Point A square that acts as a home for a piece (usually a Knight). A square can only be considered a support point if it can- not be attacked by an enemy pawn or if the enemy pawn advance (attacking the support point) would severely weaken the enemy position. Swindle A trick from an inferior position. Symmetry A situation in which both armies are identically placed on their respective sides of the board. For example, l.c4 c5 2.Nc3 Nc6 3g3 g6 4.Bg2 Bg7 5.Nf3 Nf6 6.O-O O-O 7.a3 a6 8.Rbl Rb8 9.b4 cxb4

10.axb4 b5 ll.cxb5 axb5 is a well-known symmetrical position that

comes from the English Opening. Tactics Traps, threats and schemes based on the calculation of varia- tions (at times rather long-winded). A position with many combinative motifs present is considered tactical. Tempo The unit of time represented by one move. For example: l.e4 d5 2.exd5 Qxd5 3.Nc3 gains a tempo, as the Queen must move again if it is to avoid being captured. Territory See Space. Theory Known and practiced opening, middlegame and endgame varia- tions and positions. Opening theory is also referred to as book. Threat A move or plan that, if allowed, would lead to the immediate depreciation of the enemy position. Time Can be used in several contexts. One meaning is the amount of thinking time as measured by special clocks (see Time Control) It is also used in reference to the ability to stop a particular action by the opponent, i.e., "Black does not have time to coordinate a successful defense against the coming attack.'' Thus time also measures devel- opment (an advantage in time being a lead in development) and the rate at wrhich an attack is pursued or defended.

GLOSSARY / 42.

Time Control The amount of time given to reach a certain number of moves. In international competition this is usually 40 moves in 2 V 2 hours (extra time is given after 40 moves have been played). If a player uses up his 2 1/2 hour allocation and he has not yet made 40 mows, he will lose the game by forfeit no matter what the position on the board is like. Time Pressure That period of the game when one or both players have used up most of their time and must make many moves with little deliberation. Naturally, this should be avoided since it often leads to mistakes or game-losing blunders. Transitions The changing of one phase of the game into another-the opening into the middlegame and the middlegame into the endgame. Transposition Reaching an identical position by a different sequence of moves. For example, the Dutch Defense (l.d4 f5) can be reached by Ld4 e6 2.c4 f5 or by l.c4 f5 2.d4 e6. Trap A hidden way to lure an opponent into making an error. A trap should only be laid if it is part of the overall strategic plan. This way, it does not matter if your opponent falls for it or not; you will still be improving your position. Unclear An uncertain situation. Some players never use this assess- ment, insisting that every position is either equal or favorable for one side or the other. It has even been said that "unclear" is a lazy way to avoid figuring out what's really going on in a position. Variation The first two to five moves of a game lead to the bare bones structure of a particular opening. All divergences from that point on are known as variations. Variations also occur in analysis of middlegame and endgame positions. Weakness Any pawm or square that is difficult or impossible to defend. Wild Extremely unclear. A sharp situation or move with unfathomable complications. Zugzwang "Compulsion to move." A German term referring to a situ- ation in wdiich a player would like to do nothing (pass), since any mo\'e will damage his game. Zwiscbenzug "In-between move." A German term for an often unex- pected reply throwm into an expected sequence of moves.

out what went wrong; also try to understand why it went wrong. what might have been tried, or what ought to have been the outcome with correct play. Most chess players are human beings. endowed with human qualities. They smile at the tragedy of other chess players, and say to themselves: 'That would never happen to me.' A highly dangerous presumption! One such example is a game from the 2014 U18 European Championship in the city of Batumi, Georgia, played by the extraordinary Spanish talent Jaime Santos Latasa. In a crucial game that could have earned him the title, Jaime first spoiled a promising middlegame position and then, disappointed about the way the game had developed, played an endgame - that everybody knew was still a draw - on autopilot. The expected result would have earned Jaime the bronze medal (his opponent would be silver medallist, while the Russian player Daniil Yuffa would win gold). But then this happened: 70 ... i.e6?? and after 71.ci>g61 it's zugzwang, and the position is lost. The rest of the game is of little interest: 71. .. i.h3 72.:e7 ci>f&

Latasa, Batumi 2014 (9). Thus, Boruchovsky became European Champion, Yuffa ended as the runner-up, while Jaime Santos dropped to fourth place. Errors such as the one in this game are usually the result of fatigue, time trouble, or some psychological weakness such as disappointment, apathy, or a sudden distraction. While these human factors can never be ruled out in a practical game, thorough study of the endgame can - and does - help players prevent blundering away a theoretical draw or win in the vast majority of cases. The following well-known diagram represents, I believe, the most important position in the endgame rook vs. pawn. Adrian Mikhalchishin, I am sure, would agree with me, as he presents this position in the first diagram in Chapter 1 of his book Mastering Basic Rook Endgames. Many games have reached this position, and the current one continued as follows:

55.h7?

[diagram]

[diagram]

Martin Duque, San Sebastian 2014. This shows it's never too late to spoil a perfectly tenable game, even in simplified positions. If you are a sceptical nature, and feel inclined to retort 'hang on, this was only a young player, rated below 2000 Elo', well, allow me then to show you another example, from a game Kotronias-Sandalakis, Nikaia 2016:

[diagram]

[diagram]
So there was another trick, victimising an internationally titled chess heavyweight. Or how about the following example taken from an ultimate elite contest:

This position occurred in a tiebreak game Gelfand-Anand for the World Championship, Moscow 2012. White could have broken Black' s only resource, Vancura's Defence, even with a tempo to spare, for example

61.Rg3 Rb7 62.Rg4 and White

wins. But here, White instead played

61.J:h7?? and after 61...@d6 Black got

his king closer, drew the game, and retained his world title.

Many more examples of such technical mishaps, or as Dvoretsky called them 'tragicomedies', are presented and analysed in this book to help you improve this crucial phase in the game of chess. Solving diagram positions from a book is not the same as solving problems over the board, but more often than not, having done one's homework will give a player that decisive edge at the moment of making a crucial decision. While doing these exercises, I recommend you try imagining you are playing a real game. This will help you make decisions in the most realistic - and best - frame of mind. Some learners complain: 'Is it really worth studying all endgame positions? What if I never get any of them on my board in a tournament game?' At first, such concerns appear to make some sense, and this reminds me of a strong FIDE Master confessing to me that, as a junior, he once had to deliver checkmate with bishop and knight vs. lone king, and failed. Embarrassed, he went home to study every detail of this endgame, and swore revenge: someday, he would prove that he could do it. At the time of his confession, some 20 years later, the moment still hadn't come, though, and who knows he might never get another shot at redemption. So, was his study time wasted? I would argue that it was not. Determined chess minds usually come back stronger from hardship, by discipline and rigorous analysis. Therefore, even if the statistical likelihood of you getting every position contained in this book in real games were nil, I would still whole-heartedly recommend you analyse all positions carefully; there is no better recipe for significant chess improvement. I am a firm believer in the instructional value of real game examples. It seems to me that the essence of our human condition is that to understand an ordeal, we have to be subjected to it. Theoretical knowledge alone is not enough. Therefore, all the positions in this book were taken from real games, mostly featuring strong players. Throughout this book, however, you will find examples, too, of games between average players - even beginners - particularly where these positions reveal some instructive or common mistakes. I am aware that not every blunder made on the chessboard makes it into the databases, while many others are yet to be 'found', in the Tartakowerian sense of the word; such might well be the object of my future research. The present publication, I believe, is an accurate collection not only of the most important endgames you must know, but also of the most frequent errors players of all levels commit in these positions. How to use the material In this book? Solving the exercise requires two things: an effort to calculate properly and accurate theoretical knowledge of the relevant endgame. In each Introduction exercise, the reader is asked to answer one specific question. The most common question is whether the position is winning or not. Another typical question is to choose between two or more options, an approach I personally like very much, as it mimics the decision-making process during a real game. In such positions, you should particularly look out for any subtle hidden resources. I might also ask you to assess the consequences of some simplifying operation, which is such a common occurrence in a chess game, and one which often requires mature decision-making. (To become proficient in the art of simplification, I highly recommend the books Liquidation on the Chess Board by Joel Benjamin, as well as The Correct Exchange in the Endgame by Eduardas Rozentalis.) A few times I ask you to give all the winning moves in a position, not out of any practical necessity (one winning move is more than enough in a practical game), but with the aim of reinforcing your theoretical knowledge of the endgame in question. When you work out the answers to such questions, calculation takes a back seat, and the error rate in practical play is usually much lower. In each chapter, the exercises are organized in increasing level of difficulty: while the first ones should pose few problems for the average player, the ones at the end of each chapter are likely to challenge even a seasoned chess master. Therefore, each player can work through this book focussing on positions suitable for their level. For less experienced players, my recommended approach is this: solve only the first half of each chapter, and leave the rest for some later stage of your chess improvement. By contrast, I would advise stronger players to start at the end and work their way through the chapter in reversed order, stopping once you feel the problems become as easy as eating your favourite sweet baked food at an outdoor lunch. I recommend that all players, regardless of their Elo, repeat any positions they weren't able to figure out, within one year. I am aware that level of difficulty is to some degree a subjective matter: a player who happens to have studied a particular endgame before might have no problem solving even the more difficult problems on the topic, whereas a player making his first footsteps into new endgame territory might struggle to find the basic ideas. For this reason, I have decided against awarding some sort of 'star system' to indicate the level of difficulty to each problem, which might only mislead you. What I have sometimes provided, though, is statistical analysis to show, for instance, the frequency of and average score in certain positions. To all exercises I have attached a highlighted reference to the corresponding endgame presented in 100 Endgames You Should Know, including exercises relating to the Appendix on fortresses. Please note

that not every single endgame that was covered in 100 Endgames You Must Know has made it into this book, for the simple reason that some positions produce few or no instructive mistakes in chess praxis, and have therefore been left out. Less than a handful of positions in this book are new in the sense that they received no previous coverage in 100 Endgames You Must Know. Where this is the case, I have provided detailed explanations to equip you well with all the knowledge you need to play these positions. Perhaps, such new positions will find their way into a future edition of 100 Endgames You Must Know. A final note on terminology: some terms in the English version of this book have been updated and differ from the terminology used in

100 Endgames You Must Know. I hope the new terminology improves your

reading experience. Enjoy the journey through these exercises - I am confident they will help you become a better chess player. Jesus de la Villa Pamplona, January 2019

CHAPTER 1

Basic endings It only seemed logical to make this the easiest chapter in the entire book. But don't be fooled: you will find some examples of blunders taken from high-level tournament play. It's hard to tell from database info alone whether these mistakes were the result of fatigue, time trouble, or some such psychological factor as mentioned in the introduction. But let me just remind you that superficial knowledge of endgame theory, so common in the chess world, is also an important factor that should not be underestimated.

CHAPTER 2

Knight vs. pawn The endgame covered in this chapter is still relatively easy, as evidenced by a lower error rate in practical play compared to other endings. Even though the average player should be able to play this endgame with confidence, it's necessary to learn about a few subtle resources that might otherwise not easily be discovered over the board. Let's examine the following four diagrams, designed to aid your memory: Diagram [A] represents the circuit of a knight trying to deal with a rook's pawn on the sixth rank. Diagram [B] shows the optimal range of a king vis-a-vis a knight to prevent the latter from sacrificing itself for a passed pawn. Diagram [C] shows the striking case of a knight to move giving checkmate to a king in the corner (usually the result of some cooperative play by the opponent). In diagram [D], the knight alone cannot forever control the pawn and success therefore depends on any effective barriers to delay the arrival of the enemy king.

CHAPTER 3

Queen vs. pawn The endgame of queen vs. pawn entails a more complex finale to a game of chess, as evidenced by a much higher error rate compared to the endgames covered thus far. To become a stronger player, knowledge of the basic rule is essential: the queen wins against a central pawn or a knight's pawn, while against any other pawn the result is a draw. This correct and very useful rule has, however, many exceptions. That's why so many errors slip in, often with unexpected - and painful - results. Furthermore, since players are of ten unfamiliar with the wide array of tricks available in these positions, the outcome of this type of endings almost seems unpredictable. As it is virtually impossible to present every possible trick hidden in these positions, the selected exercises aim to familiarize the reader with some of the most important ones. Particularly, the key positions we shall examine are shown in the diagrams below. In diagrams [A] and [B], White to play can save the game, but he must be alert not to fall prey to a nasty trick. Diagrams [C] and [D] represent two contrasting situations. In diagram [q, Black to move wins, but only by means of the right check; in diagram [D], the pawn on the fifth rank - provided it is to move - can draw against the queen.

CHAPTER 4

Rook vs. pawn A rook vs. pawn scenario often comes about from a rook vs. rook position (see Chapter 9), especially when one player is forced to sacrifice his rook to neutralize a passed pawn, and then tries to race his own pawn up - or down - the board, hoping to have bought himself enough time to secure a draw. I've seen these positions appear on the boards of my students many times during tournament play. The good news is that the methods of play involved in rook vs. pawn positions are clear-cut, and mastery of this kind of endgame promises tangible rewards. Since crucial decisions are usually taken when one pair of rooks still remains on the board, many exercises depart from this situation. Moreover, solving the exercises in this chapter will help you improve two important chess skills: (1) calculation, and (2) learning how and when your chessmen must share duties. The diagrams below provide some insight into the most common patterns and ideas you must know to navigate your way through this endgame with confidence: A cruclal moment

Memorize this position: Black to move advances the king and draws; White to move gives a long-range vertical check and wins! Although it doesn't matter which file the pawn is on, a couple of subtle differences must be observed: (1) the drawing procedure is different with a rook's pawn; and (2) a checking distance of two squares from behind (i.e. a check from bS, in our example) only wins against a rook's pawn. There is another important practical feature to this position: the endgame rook vs. rook's pawn appears more than three hundred times Tempo gaining Chapter 4 - Rook vs. pawn in my database, and whenever the side with the pawn was to move, they ended up losing in several dozens of games. In some games, the draw was thrown away on the first move, while in others the losing error occurred at some other critical moment, as we will see in the exercises. Cutting the king off horlzontally

In this position, an important (and the only) winning method for White is to play 1J1g5!, cutting off the black king from its pawn so that it won't be able to support it. If the pawn advances, the rook is always in time to capture it. This manoeuvre doesn't work if applied one file further down, as then the rook is unable to successfully deal with the pawn. Oft en this idea has to be anticipated - or even carried out - when both rooks are still on the board! The rook carries out a useful tempo-gaining manoeuvre by first giving check and only then placing itself behind the pawn, forcing the enemy king to lose precious time. This manoeuvre can be decisive if the king is two ranks in front of the pawn, as it is forced to move back.

Promoting to a knight Promoting to a knight (in a general sense also known as 'underpromotion', i.e. opting for a piece of lesser value than the queen) with check is another common resource, and is often the only way to save the game when the opponent presses from behind. Diagram [D] is the most typical situation, leading to a draw. In diagram [E], with a rook's pawn, promoting to a knight won't save Black. Positions [F] and [G] are less common, but worthy of attention nonetheless. In diagram [F], which comes about after the rook had to give a check from the fifth rank, knight promotion secures a draw for White. Diagram [G] shows a situation where the weaker side's king has been cut off on the edge of the board while the stronger side's king was able to rapidly approach, unhindered by any obstacles along the way. In this case, promoting to a knight is losing.

CHAPTER 5

Rook vs. two pawns Similar to the previous chapter, this imbalance commonly arises after one player sacrifices their rook for a passed pawn. Therefore, the fight between a rook and two pawns is of great practical importance. Almost no specific theoretical knowledge is required, except perhaps for the well-known rule that two connected pawns on the sixth rank are unstoppable, which is a common situation even with more material on the board. On the other hand, when a rook combats two separated pawns (one supported by its king) the practical advice provided in this chapter is all you need to play these positions with confidence. Specifically, keep in mind the following three techniques: outflanking to get the king in front of the pawns, latching onto the hindmost pawn with the king (hereby christened as playing tag, as in the children's game), and switching pole po sition, i.e. being able to choose which pawn should be the front-runner in the race toward promotion. If you're not yet familiar with these techniques, I recommend that you first study the theoretical chapter in 100 Endgames You Must Know, before trying the exercises. As was my approach in 100 Endgames You Must Know, I focus here mainly on positions with connected pawns; positions with separated pawns, though interesting, are of too little theoretical value, and therefore omitted.

CHAPTER 6

Same-coloured bishops: bishop + pawn vs. bishop The previous chapters all dealt with endgames characterized by extreme imbalances (queen vs. pawn; rook vs. one or two pawns). Now the time has come to focus on some endgames involving pieces of equal strength. This chapter examines same-coloured bishop endings (for opposite coloured bishop endings, see Chapter 8). In these positions, most errors are the result of misplaying standard theoretical positions, particularly one that requires the defending king to seek the opposition from behind. Diagram [A] shows the correct position of the defending king: it is a draw regardless of who is to play. Diagram [B] is similar, but here, Black to move still has to make the correct decision, something many players in practice fail to do! In diagram [C], Black loses regardless of who is to play, because the diagonal from which to stop the pawn is too short. Diagram (D] presents another defensive technique with the king in front: Black draws if he immediately brings the king to g8.

CHAPTER 7

Bishop vs. knight: one pawn on the board From a theoretical point of view, the endgame of bishop vs. knight (with one side being a pawn up) is among the least well-researched. That said, it's worth taking notice of a couple of useful - indeed paradoxical - positions. Diagrams [A] and [B] show us the most common critical positions, of which the position in diagram [A] is most seen in practice. In both diagrams, we see a dangerous h-pawn on the verge of promotion, which would be winning if it weren't for an important resource the defending side has at his disposal: sacrificing the passive bishop to imprison the gluttonous king. Furthermore, the position in diagram [A] is a draw no matter who is to move, whereas the position in diagram [B] is winning for Black, regardless of whose turn it is. It's fairly easy to see that the side with the pawn should be in no rush to go after the bishop. In diagrams [C] and [D] we see knight and pawn with an off-side defending king; the position in diagram [C] is a win for Black, provided he is to play, as the bishop can be deprived of the squares on the shortest diagonal; in diagram [D] the shortest diagonal for the bishop is five squares, and therefore it doesn't need the help of its king to make a draw, unless White plays carelessly. Except from these diagram positions, it's useful to know that the knight usually has a hard time stopping a passed pawn supported by a bishop, and unless the knight is firmly settled in front of the pawn - and barring the odd tactic - its only hope lies in stalemate.

CHAPTER 8

Opposite-coloured bishops: bishop + two pawns vs. bishop The opposite-coloured bishops endgame is governed by rules of its own, and typically represents a fight between one side trying to push their passed pawn(s) forward and a defending bishop preventing this, operating through a parallel universe its oblique competitor can never touch. Thus, we enter a whole new world of endgame theory. Here are some key guidelines to keep in mind: • Two connected pawns are a draw, provided the defending bishop is able to take up the correct defensive stand; • Two pawns separated by one file almost never win; Two pawns further away from one another almost always win (a caveat: if one of those pawns is a knight's pawn, it'd better not be too far advanced!). Also, beware of specific features/manoeuvres, such as: • Special pawns; and • Bring the king round via a lengthy detour. The diagrams below show six common positions players tend to mess up. Except for the position in diagram [F], the result of the game doesn't depend on whose turn it is. Basic defensive stand Basic defensive stand

The king can go all the way round Premium pawns For players who have studied these positions before, the exercises might be a walk in the park. But for those players that are new to this endgame, I suggest the following training method: try to determine what the correct result of the game should be (with Black and with White to move); then, try to determine the appropriate winning or drawing manoeuvre. If your assessment proves wrong, look up the corresponding position in 100 Endgames You Must Know; only after that you should do the test positions in this chapter. Also, please be prepared to have some good fun, as some of these positions come with a fantastic element of surprise! (120)

CHAPTER 9

Rook + pawn vs. rook While the rook is but a passive bystander in the earliest stages of a game, the further a game of chess evolves, the more important it becomes. Once an endgame is reached, statistics unmistakably show that it decides more games than any other. The improving chess player is therefore strongly encouraged to improve their skills wielding the most straightforward of chessmen. Statistics, however, also show that rook endgames produce a much higher error rate than any other, so despite its rectilinear simplicity, there must be more than meets the eye. The selected exercises aim to provide you with a better grasp of the most important ideas. Some motifs repeat themselves throughout the test positions, but are usually approached from different perspectives. I am convinced that by facing similar problems repeatedly, and approached from different angles and with additional subtleties, learning becomes both more efficient and more meaningful. Beware that if you are unfamiliar with some of the basic manoeuvres, even the easiest exercises might prove challenging. If this is true for you, I recommend you study the main theory in 100 Endgames You Must Know before trying the exercises. I've grouped what I believe to be the most important positions into three categories, as shown in the diagrams below. In none of the positions does it matter who is to play, except for the position in diagram [H]. Basic positions Philidor position Lucena - The Bridge

Rook + two pawns vs. rook Welcome to yet another chapter on the ever-important rook endgame. Contrary to the previous chapter, which dealt with rook and one pawn vs. rook, here there are not so many theoretical positions. The five main theoretical positions represented below in six diagrams each have distinctive features. Some of them allow for a very simple defence; others require thorough study of a tedious and exhausting defence, all too easily mishandled in a practical game (in particular positions with a bishop's or a rook's pawn).

CHAPTER 11

Pawn endings As players' ratings go up, pawn endgames become less common. The following statistics illustrate this: in the general database (with more than 10 million games), pawn endgames occur in about 3%, whereas in Chess Informant this rate drops to a mere 0.8%. From personal experience I can attest to this, as my personal database clearly mirrors this general trend: before I reached 2300 Elo, 3% of my own games ended in pawn endings; once I surpassed that level, the rate dropped to only 1%. The phenomenon, I believe, is fairly easily explained: the beginning chess player is naturally inclined to capture or exchange any chessmen on offer, and often does so unwittingly, i.e. by failing to properly assess the resulting positions. The expert player, on the other hand, is able to calculate more deeply, and understands the potentially fatal consequences of entering into this pieceless territory far better than the beginner does. Therefore, in practical games between strong players, we often see one of two scenarios unfold: (1) players may decline offers to simplify the position, knowing it is not in their best interest to venture into a pawn endgame, or (2) the game ends beforehand, i.e. the players, by mutual understanding, recognize that to play on a position that they know will end in a split point, would be a pointless affair altogether. The above stated is reflected in the selected exercises, which feature games of different levels. Despite the large number of exercises, the level of difficulty is generally lower compared to other chapters. If you are a proficient player I suggest you try some of the final exercises; if you feel those are like shooting fish in a barrel. you might want to skip this chapter altogether, and focus on more challenging aspects of endgame theory instead. Contrary to all other chapters in this book, no diagrams are presented to illustrate any basic positions. The reason is that there are simply too many of them. Moreover, virtually all come with a myriad of exceptions. But please note that some of the solutions refer to the most important diagrams on pawn endings from Chapter 1.

CHAPTER 12

Other material relations Just as in every chess book there comes a time to deal with odds and ends, in every chess player's life there comes a time to play a pawnless endgame. We shall deal here with the dreaded bishop-and-knight vs. lone king endgame, as well as with the endgame of rook-and-bishop vs. rook. A few other miscellaneous topics included are those dealing with fortresses, drawing with bishop against rook, and rook-and-pawn vs. queen. In a pawnless endgame, recognizing certain key positions is paramount, i.e. knowing how and when it is possible to get them, or, as the game situation may require, knowing how and when to avoid them. This holds true, in particular, for the bishop-and-knight vs. lone king mating procedure. In practice, the lone king has often escaped justice, but trust me, once you know what to look out for, you'll be able to bring it to execution.

CHAPTER 13

Appendix Fortresses A fortress is a position in which one side has a clear material advantage, but is unable to force a win against a simple yet rock-solid defensive set-up that usually requires little or no subtle play by the defender. Amateur players seem to be naturally attracted to such positions. One reason for this might be that in the amateur's mind, the sturdy fortress evokes the image of heroism of a bygone age. And why not, chess fortresses often do in fact resemble the mighty ones from medieval times. The most striking features of a fortress are: • No pawn breaks are available; • There are no passed pawns, or these are firmly blocked; • The stronger side can't penetrate into the enemy position; • The defending side is in no danger of falling into zugzwang. On the other hand, the attacker must try to break the fortress by any means possible (often, none will be available). The most important techniques to be tried are: • Break in forcefully, by means of sacrifices; • Get the king in; • Use zugzwang. No diagrams are shown here; there are simply too many theoretical fortresses. Should your memory need refreshing on this topic, I recommend you look at the positions given in the Introduction and Fortress Appendix of 100 Endgames You Must Know. My personal belief is that the exercises here are generally easier compared to other chapters because you know exactly what to look for. Even the most impressive moves such as the ones seen in Fedoseev-Carlsen could be found by ordinary players if they have at least some notion of what they should be looking for. Of course, in a real game situation nobody will tell you whether there is a fortress to be found, so developing a keen eye for any sign that might warn you of such a possibility arising in the position is extremely useful. By analogy, developing a sense of danger to prevent a weaker side from creating a fortress is also an essential skill for the improving chess player. (285)

This basic manoeuvre to combat an enemy king's unobstructed march is difficult to find over the board if you haven't seen it before: voluntarily blocking your own pawn in the heat of a crucial battle for tempi is, after all, a rather counter-intuitive idea.

Exercise 85 Giorgi Glorgadze Andrei lstratescu Elista ol 1998 (4)

Despite the offside black king, White can't win, unless the black rook is unable to give any checks from behind. The main rule that applies to this kind of endgame is as follows: it's a draw if the rook is on the first or the second rank; if it's on any other rank, the side with the rook loses. The exact placement of the black king is, perhaps surprisingly, never an issue: it ensures a draw from any square on the board. Notwithstanding these theoretical generalities, according to my

database, this concrete position, including all possible symmetries and positions with the rook on different squares, has occurred in only a few games.

This is what Black had missed: the hindmost pawn that White suddenly turns his attention to, is out of the black king's reach.

In conclusion, we can establish the following rule: the defending king, to make a draw, mustn't be more than one step away from the enemy pawn, i.e. in this particular position it should have been on the d3-square, for example.

ENDING 32

Exercise 89 Igor Glek Smbat Lputlan Dortmund 1992 (8) A familiar sight: two connected pawns supported by their king vis-a-vis a defending rook placed behind them.

The endgame with c- and f-pawns is winning, unless the defending side manages to control them on the same diagonal. White's next move doesn't spoil anything, but forces him to find a fantastic resource, as we shall soon see.

After this move, White needs several only moves to win. The pawns are frozen on one diagonal (a2-g8), but his strong king is an important trump.

One extra pawn almost never wins in an opposite-coloured bishops endgame. Theoretical interest, therefore, usually departs from a two-pawn surplus. With more pawns on the board, the key to winning such positions is to find the right way to simplify, i.e. by exchanging any and all of the opponent's pawns, to end up with the most promising two vs. zero majority.

Ulf was famous for lulling his victims into a false sense of security, beyond the point of no return. After this move, Black gets an ideal horizontal cutoff. A) 67.@e4! not only avoids a horizontal cutoff, it also renders a vertical one toothless, since with the knight's pawn, two files are

insufficient to carry out Grigoriev's winning method: 67. ..bS 68J:tbl @b6 and White's pieces are placed ideally, but only one move holds:

White has one losing move, the culprit being his own pawn.

Exercise 186 Many games White's playing his rook to the sixth is a rather devious idea, setting the stage for one of the most common errors in the whole of

endgame theory. The pawn being a bishop's pawn means that Black has two defensive options; with a central pawn, he would only have one. In my database, one hundred and seventeen games reached this position, out of which twenty- one did not end in a draw; with a central pawn, there are only forty-nine games, but the drawing percentage isn't any higher: sixteen games.

White has achieved a winning Philidor position, but time is against him, both on the clock (he was in serious time trouble) and on the board (he is close to violating the fifty-move rule). 105 . .Bf2?1 This game represents one of the most dramatic climaxes in the history of modern chess. A pawnless endgame started on move 66, and after a long phase of objective equilibrium, Black fell into a losing Philidor position on move 102. At this point, White had to find a checkmate within eleven moves or sign the score sheets with only half a point because of the fifty-move rule. Unfortunately for him, the move in the game leads to a longer checkmating sequence. Performing well in this kind of endgame, under such demanding circumstances, requires not only theoretical and technical skill, but also physical endurance.

With the black pawn on h7 the possible 'fortress' created doubts for a long time: since Black can carry through ...h7-h5 with the help of either his rook or his king, and in general this should be winning. However, here White can keep the draw. The key is twofold: he has to prevent the ... h7-h5 advance until the black rook leaves the second rank, and then has to meet the advance to hS with the immediate response h3-h4!. And this should happen under two conditions: the bishop stays on the long diagonal in case of the advance ... g5-g4, and the pawn on h4 is not lost in case of a pawn exchange. or example:

1943. The last game to finish is against Obersturbannfuhrer Spak.

'I resign' declares the German officer, 'My position is hopeless' Alekhine turns the board round, and takes the black pieces himself, and says 'Play oni'Two moves follow and the German again declares that, believe it or not he must resign as White's game is hopeless. Once again Alekhine turns the board round and now announces mate in three on White's behalf. An amusing touch - the champion has won with both White and Black, but how can this be expressed in chess language for the TV screen I must admit it took me two weeks to figure it out, but I got there in the end. (56) It is Black to play and he can see no defence against the threat, since after 1 g6 2 # h 7 + ^ 8 3 ^ h 8 + he is mated. When

Alekhine takes Black he makes the rejoinder 1 gh 4! when White can only take the rook with knight - 2 gX h4? p e n mates. So 2 4^Xh4 p c 3 and White could see no defence to mate at b2, since if 3 фс1 p a 1+ winning the rook and then the pinned knight. Once again Alekhine takes White and goes 3 p h 8 + i <R>Xh8 4 <£sg6+ and mate next move. The whole value of this example was brought out after the actors had performed the scene when the play was examined from a technical point of view. This is an excellent example of combinative play exploiting open lines. The final combination with the queen sacrifice on h8 is a typical 'ambush' combination. Thus an entertaining episode is used for instruction purposes.* Before passing on to the topic of special chess schools in the USSR we follow the path of the improving player. When he becomes an adult he passes on into adult competitions which are based on strict competition and qualification. Only in very rare cases does the Soviet Chess Federation make so bold as to try to correct the consequences of bad luck or misfortune. The main event of the year for all players is the Soviet Championship. No matter what a player's high standing may be a grandmaster can be authorised to miss this event only by the Praesidium of the Chess Federation. On the other hand if the top players find it hard to get out of competing in the championship, aspirants to take part in it find it just as hard to get in. The qualification system works as follows:- The list of entrants for the Super League starts with the Otborochnii (Selection) tournament or from special quarter-final groups (The Chess Federation has not yet come to a final conclusion which tournaments are better but more and more protests are being made against the 13-round, 64-man Swiss * Translator's Note A 254 page book Chess School was issued in 1976 to accompany the TV course Apart from contributions by Kotov and Averbakh it contains an 80 page account by Yudovich of the history of chess and the theory of the openings Television Tuition 75 System used for the Otborochmi). From here qualifiers move on to the First Division of the Championship with only the winner of the Otborochnn seeded direct to the Top League. Then the leading few from the First Division qualify for the Top League held at the end of the year. Thus a strict principle of promotion and relegation according to actual results is observed. During the rest of the year there is an extensive programme of events, both individual and team. The chief ones are the Soviet Spartakiad, the USSR Cup and various international tournaments such as the Central Club tournament, the Chigorin Memorial, the Keres Memorial in Tallinn and so on. As is well known our grandmasters compete in international tournaments throughout the world as well as helping countries that are backward in chess by means of lectures, exhibitions and coaching. Our top players are doubtless affected by the massiveness of our organisation and the consciousness that they serve the people and so have special obligations. The scale of Soviet chess is immense - more than three million organised players, one million of them category players, spread throughout 148,000 collectives and 1,500 clubs. There are nearly 700 masters, 61 grandmasters and 13 world champions out of 18. The work of popularising the game in the outside world is also immense - more than 25 countries a year are visited by our chess representatives. Different Nuances of the Word 'School' In art and literature the word 'school' can be understood as a definite creative trend which unites people throughout the world in their views on the subject in question. Then there is also the meaning of a combined organisation having its own building, head, teaching staff and programme of studies. In the period of the 1920's to the 1940's there were no organised schools where chess was taught in some form or other, yet from the very first steps along the road to creating a native School of Chess three trends emerged as regards unity of views and principles. These were the Leningrad school, the Moscow school and the Ukrainian school. A leading role was played at once by the Leningrad school, although in assessing the results of Lenmgrad-Moscow matches, of tournament performances of the time and even in analytical work we note a prolonged sharp rivalry between the representatives of the capital city and Leningrad. After the October Revolution Leningrad maintained its mass of strong and theoretically experienced masters. These great connois seurs and strong practicians raised their research work to a high level especially since their city was the place where in those days the only chess magazine Shakhmatny Listok was published. A leading role was played by players who became Soviet Champions on a number of occasions or took high places in the national championship - Levenfish, Romanovsky, Ilyin-Genevsky, I.Rabino vich and so on. Naturally with the presence of such pedagogues there emerged a wave of young talents headed by the leader of Soviet chess Mikhail Botvinmk. Here we find Ragozin, Chekhover, Lisitsyn and others. Later on came a fresh generation of grandmasters, graduates of the Leningrad Pioneer Palace who were taught by the trainer Zak - Taimanov, Spassky, Korchnoi and others. A similar development is seen in Moscow. After the October Revolution chess was supported by Nenarokov, Grigoriyev, and A.Rabinovich. Then in the 1930's we have the emergence of a group of young talented masters - Ryumin, Kan, Belavenets, Yudovich, the theoretician Simagin and so on. They competed successfully with the Leningrad players both in matches and theoretical research The Ukrainian school provided massive reinforcements. Here a leading role was played by the outstanding theoretician Rauzer who invented many systems in various openings along with another theoretician Konstantinopolsky. These were followed by new names who were to make the Ukraine famous throughout the world - Boleslavsky, Bronstein, Geller, Stein and others. The Great Fatherland War brought significant changes to the geographical location of our schools of players. By the middle of the 1940's there had been a movement of people to Moscow. Botvinnik, Levenfish and Romanovsky from Leningrad, Bronstein, Konstantinopolsky and Geller from the Ukraine. This rather weakened the two areas mentioned, though they still put up a good resistance to the capital in team matches. We must be honest though and say that the Leningrad school has fallen back from the point of the development of leading players. In our days The Russian Fedeation has played a big part in producing such names as Polugayevsky, the late Bondarevsky, Tseshkovsky, Sveshnikov, Krogius and others. There has been a growth of talent in the Baltic Republics where the names of Tal and Keres speak for themselves. We shall have occasion later to speak of the special features of the Georgian school with its flowering of female talent. That is an outline of the various schools from the point of view of territorial distribution On top of this in our days there has been the favourable development of schools in the proper sense of the word without any territorial limitations. From the 1950's onwards we have had certain schools which

76 Schools of Chess

Different Nuances of the Word 'School' 77 have done an immense amount of good in developing talent. In this respect we must name first of all the schools of Botvinnik, of Karseladze, and of Kart. Soviet Immortals Before dealing with these schools of a new type and their 'graduates' we would like to take a look in passing at the recent achievements of those players who may be called veterans or 'candidate-veterans! These are the players who for almost a quarter of a century have been defending the country's colours and still figure high up in the lists of the best in the world. We are interested moreover not so much in their sporting results. Age has not dulled their keen thought, or deprived them of their inventiveness and fantasy. They play such deep convincing games that their play still attracts those who esteem the element of art in chess, for whom the question of how a game was played plays as great a part as what its result was. We trust the games we now demonstrate will act as a compass for the reader in his striving to assimilate the best that there is in chess, will stimulate him to work at improving his play and understanding. Mikhail Tal remains full of force in his inventive thinking. His games have always been artistic and exciting with their revelation of the struggle of the pieces, yet the keen student will find other hidden facets in them. Certainly his games still get rave notices from his fellow grandmasters. As Taimanov once wrote 'The ex-world champion's combinations often exert a sort of paralysing influence on the opponent's play. It would seem that the element of surprise plays a big part in this! How many surprise moves there are in this game from the 1979 Yugoslavia-USSR match.

Chess Trainers and their Background The chess organisation of every country sooner or later comes up against the question of chess coaching and the trainers needed to run it. Where can these trainers be got from, what sort of qualifications and training do they need? Does the trainer have to be a strong player who is now no longer playing in top events because of the age factor? Can a young master cope with such work? The experience of Soviet chess will be helpful in finding the answer to these questions, so we have decided to devote some space to it. First of all let us define terms and restrict our task to the proper sense of coaching. During top class events, especially those involving the world championship qualifying cycle one sees the players regularly accompanied by a well-known grandmaster or master. This person is the second whose task it is to help the player in his preparation before the event and before each game, often taking part in the choice of opening variations and giving advice after each game is finished and is being analysed. The main task tends to be assisting in the analysis of adjourned games The 'period of service' of such seconds is not long and during the next such

82 Schools of Chess

event the player may invite someone else to be his second this time. What are the qualities of a good second, and is it really essential to have one at all? Possibly it is better to try to do it all on your own? Does a second always help, or can he actually be a hindrance? The simple answer must be that if a potential second not only knows the game well but is a friend of yours then make use of his services. If you can be sure that you can rely on him for good overnight analysis of an adjourned game while you get your valuable sleep then it is worth having him. However if you have any fears that as soon as you go to bed your second will not be long in following your example after a quick look through one or two variations for the sake of form and will make out next morning that he has slaved through the night, then such a false helper is better done without. Moreover can such a helper for one event be called a trainer? Certainly not! A trainer is a person who is concerned with his charge day by day, and pays a lot of attention to the work We certainly need seconds for certain events but they must not be confused with trainers. It is an interesting feature of chess that the opportunities for building up a group of training personnel are greater than in other sporting activities. In most of the latter a person becomes a trainer or coach after finishing his active career at some time in his thirties In chess on the other hand a trainer may well continue his own career and carry on getting excellent results For example there is the excellent play at Madrid 1973 by the late Semyon Furman who competed there along with his famous pupil Anatoly Karpov. Several of our younger grandmasters have as trainer international master Mark Dvoretsky who is still active m tournament play and has hopes of the grandmaster title for himself. Botvinmk had as trainer for a long time that charming person Vyacheslav Ragozin who combined a big workload with participation as a competitor in the 1948 Interzonal tournament. Dvoretsky has written thus'- 1 feel that it is no less interesting to be a trainer than to play oneself. I even take greater delight in the tournament successes of my lads than I do in my own However I have no intention of giving up practical play, I enjoy meeting strong players at the board and my impressions as a practical player can be of use to me as a trainer Possibly other strong players from amongst our grandmasters and masters would like to combine the two 'specialities'? After all creative contact with talented, clever and curious youngsters can bring great pleasure!' Trainer and Pupil Experience in the Soviet Union has given some guidelines to help a trainer working regularly with one (or several) people under his Trainer and Pupil 83 charge. in studying openings it is harmful and too much like rote learning to consider all the openings, but it is also wrong to restrict work to one or two openings which makes it too easy for the opponent to prepare. A good deal of attention ought to be given to typical endgames. As Kasparov recalls, 'When I was preparing for one term's work in the Botvinmk school I had to spend a lot of time on king and pawn endings so when I came to a tricky position in my own games I knew the winning method' Yet it stands to reason that the main attention must be focussed on the middle game, the principal phase of the game In such study it is useful to work through the analysis of all sorts of games and positions and to annotate games, both one's own and those of others. 'In chess as in any other form of sport the guarantee of future success is a properly laid down training programme There are many habits which have to be inculcated such as the ability to calculate variations, the correct assessment of position, the accurate realisation of advantage, the correct psychological choice of continuation. All these can be, and must be, developed by special training! (Dvoretsky). When a trainer has several pupils his task becomes more difficult, since he has to have an individual approach to each. A knowledge of each pupil's strengths and weaknesses is essential in order to be able to build on the one and try to reduce the other. Here are some other comments by Dvoretsky:- A player's attention should be constantly fixed on the backward parts of his play, and special exercises on these themes should be constantly repeated. To quote a few examples from my own pupils I can point out that Chekhov was poor in endgame technique so I constantly worked on drawing his attention to standard methods of endgame play in varied positions As a result he made swift and obvious progress. Then again Dolmatov was lacking in physical stamina, so he had to do a lot of sport (running, football, swimming and so on) and water treatment* in order to strengthen his nervous system. Nowadays he has enough staying-power to last out a full five hour playing session and a whole tournament. ' Translator's Note Water treatment A system of strengthening the organism widely recommended in Soviet sports literature. The body is rubbed with cool and later cold water and sponge until it becomes used even to cold baths and swimming in the open air during frosty weather

9 Botvinnik's Chess School

The chess organisation of Soviet Trade Unions had the excellent idea in 1963 of setting up a small school that would coach some of the most gifted young players of the country. Former world champ ion Mikhail Botvinnik, our greatest theoretician, and a Doctor of Technical Science expressed the desire to run the school where the studies take place by post. For nearly two decades this school has been turning out 'graduates' who have a fine grasp of chess strategy and tactics, experience of practical play and the routine needed for this. Most important of all they have had developed in them the knack of working independently at chess study. There can be no doubt that the main feature of the school is its head. Botvinnik's name has figured in the world of chess, and outside it too, for more than half a century. The 'patriarch' of Soviet chess, as we lovingly cal! him, has gone through an immense experience of match and tournament play. He took part in more than fifty top-class tournaments in his forty years of active play, was world champion for thirteen years, winning or defending the title on five separate occasions, and played for our winning Olympiad side six times. He is a player who to an unprecedented extent penetrated deeply into the possibilities of the game, more than all the remaining grandmasters of his day. Another world champion Tigran Petrosian has eloquently described the emotions of a player who had to sit on the other side of the board from Botvinnik. He once told how hard he found it to play against Fischer, but then went on, 'Yet it was harder to play against Botvinnik! You got a feeling then of having no way out. This was a very unpleasant feeling. Once in conversation with Keres I told him about this and even drew the comparison of Botvinnik as a bulldozer clearing everything away from its path. Keres smiled and commented 'Just think what it was like for those who had to play him when he was younger" No less expressive are the words of Geller, describing his feelings as he sat down at the board to play Mikhail Moiseyevich 'Games against Botvinnik, as a rule, are a battle against Botvinmk's Chess School 85 monmumental strategy. Just as the visible part of an iceberg makes up only one sixth of its height, so too in this battle the greater part of the ideas are not brought out. In such a case the consequences of the slightest mistake are quite considerable' It is easy to understand that the school of such a great expert attracted the best talent from throughout the country. These included what are now very well-known names such as Anatoly Karpov from Zlatoust, Yury Balashov from Schadrinsk, Yury Razuvayev from Moscow. Later on they were joined by Yelena Akmilovskaya from Krasnoyarsk, Harry Kasparov from Baku, Artur Yusupov and Sergei Makarichev from Moscow. All parts of our large country were represented. It did not take long to settle how the work should be organised It was decided to meet face to face in short sessions two or three times a year. These get-togethers normally took place in Moscow during the school holidays at New Year and in the spring, while in the summer the venue was a holiday resort or health centre. The administration of the school realised how difficult it is to teach chess at a higher level, especially on the basis of a correspondence course. The studies had to be adjusted to the individual features of each student, his character, age, health, style of play and preferences. A great deal had to be taken into account in particular how to develop a love for the game and how to stimulate his strong points and eradicate his weak ones. The standard study method is simple and convincing. When he goes home from a session each student gets his own individual assignment which has been carefully thought out by the coach. During the long break between sessions the student has to work through this assignment, and at the next session he must make a report on what he has done The principle is thus strictly followed that the assignments are individual but the reports on them are collective So the days of the session fly by as the keen students give an account of their progress and take part in the group assessment of the others in turn, all the while taking note of the critical comments by the coach. At the end of each session a fresh assignment is set which must be carried out before the next meeting. The students are not frightened of tough assignments, but rather welcome them, knowing that such hard tasks are a fresh step on the road to perfection. During his life a pupil has to learn from many teachers. He learns his native language, mathematics, natural sciences. Often teachers will tell how they learned and studied. Yet m the chess school the pupils have a teacher of the highest class who can pass on the lessons learned in top-class tournament play as well as the secrets of theory worked out by the most outstanding researchers in this

86 Botvinnik's Chess School

field over the last half century. That is why the time spent in Botvinnik's school and the counsel he gives is remembered so vividly by his pupils. Anatoly Karpov recalls 'My studies with Botvinnik brought me immense benefit, particularly the homework assignments which forced me to refer to chess books and to work independently! Harrik Kasparov, a student of the next generation backs him up 'In 1973 when I was still a boy who just liked playing chess Mikhai1 Moiseyevich invited me to join his school There is no price I could name for the things I got from it in the course of the five years I was there. He does not use his authority to bear down too hard on the pupils and to impose his views on them. Botvinnik is the person who confirmed in me the view that Alekhine's chess is my sort too. At each stage he suggests his approach. At the beginning of 1977 I became Soviet Junior Champion for the second time scoring 81/2 out of 9 and winning the title with a round to spare. I went to Moscow with the idea that everything was going swimmingly for me. There at the school Mikhail Moiseyevich congratulated me on my victory and suggested that I go through my winning games. Here I was severely criticised at some points in them by him, yet to hear from Botvinnik that the quality of my play in the recent event gave him great hopes for me was the height of happiness! A point to note here is that the pupil is not automatically permitted to make his report on the assignment. Before this is done his overall profile and progress between sessions is assessed by experienced teachers. These ask themselves what are his results in tournaments, what are his exam results and academic progress at school, is he fit, does he take part in sport, does he know the history of chess? They also check up all his games, assessing their standard. Only if all these things are in good order can the pupil appear before his fellows and relate how he has tackled the tasks assigned to him by Botvinnik. This superb school is organised by wise pedagogues. It is the dream of thousands of boys and girls to qualify for it. Boys are admitted from the 11-18 age group, girls from 13-18. Only the most promising talents are admitted. In addition to theoretical assignments there are practical trials such as simultaneous exhibitions. Here is an example from one such exhibition which will be useful for all chess coaches to work through. The thoughts attributed here to Botvinnik may not be exactly those thoughts that he had at the time, but this is the direction in which they will have gone, as he both tried to discover what his opponent knew and tried to play in such a way that the pupil would extract the maximum benefit from the encounter. Botvinnik's Chess School 87 Karpov-Botv/nnik Caro-Kann Defence Clock simultaneous played November 13th, 1963, in Moscow.

Such coaching sessions go on year after year, and the staff changes little by little. Sometimes former students of the school are enrolled to be teachers there. Nowadays there are quite young boys and girls studying there. Who knows what will become of them in the course of time? Our chess fans have become accustomed to seeing the reference 'studied in Botvinnik's chess school' when they read accounts of the tournament performancees of this or that young chess talent. Yes, his students have reached the top in various events and some of them are exerting themselves to reach the final stage - an attempt to take the chess crown from the most distinguished student of them all, Anatoly Karpov. So we shall try to introduce the reader to the leading 'graduates' of this legendary school. Perhaps their games and biography will stimulate the reader to strive himself to improve his play You are about to go through a picture gallery of players whose long years of hard study under the guidance of an experienced teacher finally paid off in their mastery of the theory and practice of chess. Yuri Balashov With the exception of Anatoly Karpov himself this calm, restrained, taciturn pupil of Botvinmk is the one with the best tournament record over the years. He has a particularly fme record in qualifying events for the world championship - in the last two cycles he took first place in special USSR Zone tournaments to determine our representatives for the FIDE Interzonals (in 1975 he was in a fourfold tie for first place). The annoying thing is that he has followed these successes up in mediocre fashion, and so has never qualified for a place in the Candidates' Matches that his other results would indicate as a legitimate outcome. Yuri Balashov 89 Then there are his results in the USSR Championship where he was second in 1976 and equal third-fourth in 1979 - enviable stability. Finally he has often taken first place in strong international tournaments. He has a fine knowledge of theory, and by this we do not just mean opening variations It was not for nothing that Karpov chose him as his chief second in the 1978 world title match at Baguio. I have had occasion myself to see how hard he works at this. In

1970 I was head of the Soviet delegation at the Fischer-Taimanov

match in Vancouver and Yuri was there, along with Vasyukov, as Taimanov's second He had brought with him almost all Fischer's games and for days on end he kept filling his notebook with all sorts of analyses. So he only has to overcome the final hurdle in perfecting his play in order to make it to the very top. What is this slight detail that holds him back from this? Possibly the answer lies in these words of Botvinnik1'Yuri Balashov studied with me for eighteen months. I feel that the obstacle which is holding him back is an inadequte natural feel for position. To some extent he has overcome this by hard work. On the other hand he is an excellent tactician and while still in the school he amazed everybody by his tactical conceptions'. Botvinmk's comment about an excellent tactician has often been echoed. Here is an example from the 1979 USSR Super League which has a firework-like series of tactical blows. This is Romamshin-Balashov, in which it is level for the moment. White decides to go for active play on the #-side and opens up files to help this. 13 аЗ b4 14 £^a4 ^ d 7 15 c3 ba 16 b4 White's idea is clear. He hopes by g X a 3 and then gfa1 to attack the a6 pawn often enough to win it. However Black has a breathing space and while White takes two moves to re-establish material equality Black can create play in the centre. It is well-known that such centre play is more important than play on the wings. White's misfortune is that Black can soon extend his central play to the <R>-side with threats to the king. Balashov demonstrates this in most inventive style.

Yuri Razuvayev When still very young he had a stroke of luck that many others dream of. He was fortunate enough to turn out on the junior board for the 'Trud' team in the championship of the voluntary sports societies.* Trud's top board was Botvinmk and soon young Yuri became a student in the school, though for various reasons this Yurt Razuvayev 97 period of study was not very long. Many years later Rasuvayev became the friend and helper of Anatoly Karpov. To spend years in the company of two such titans of chess is the sort of thing others can only dream about. The general opinion of commentators on Razuvayev is that he is an excellent tactician, but that his strategical 'baggage' was inadequate for a long time and this held him back from getting good tournament results and the grandmaster title. However hard work finally brought him into the ranks of our strongest players and in the 1976 tournament in Cuba he gained the long-awaited title. 'Rather belated' was the view of the sceptics, 'Razuvayev gets the title at the age of thirty-one, yet in our day there are even some sixteen year old grandmasters! However there are no obstacles for those who really love chess. The new 'old' grandmaster continued and continues to work hard. In particular he has devoted particular attention to the play of the great strategist of the past Akiba Rubinstein, The result of his study is the new book on Rubinstein in the Moscow 'Fizkultura i Sport' series, but even more important the author is still learning and so can reckon on fresh successes in the future. Along with tournament appearances Yuri has recently been coaching himself as an assistant to Smyslov in a special chess school. So this is the third world champion with whom he has worked. Not just tournament successes impress the true chess fan. The sort of fine combinative attack which Razuvayev produces enthuses him and induces him to spend hours working through their ramifications. Here is an example from the game Razuvayev- Lputyan, First Division, Soviet Championship, Frunze, 1979: 65 m н шшт m ш m m

He worked directly under Botvinmk for three consecutive years, and then the rest of his career since then under Mark Dvoretsky, but you have to bear in mind that international master Dvoretsky is also a pupil of Botvinmk, and in recent years has been assistant to his old coach. The creative co-operation of Yusupov and Dvoretsky gives great pleasure to both of them, and the coach has often said what a fine pupil he has and what joy he gets from their get-togethers. We have spoken of the friendship of these two, but we really should speak of three, since another Botvinmk pupil Sergei Dolmatov has been a regular companion to Yusupov. The closeness of their careers can be gauged from the fact that at the 1978 World Junior Championship the gold medal went to Dolmatov and the silver to Yusupov, while in the previous event m 1977 Yusupov had been recipient of the gold medal. So the three players are often seen together and the coach can give them the same tasks, especially the key assignment - to play in bold fashion and to continue to learn all facets of chess mastery. Yusupov began quite early and has only recently left his teens, in 1973 at the age of thirteen he represented Moscow in the all-Umon Youth Games and four years later he took the World Junior Championship so becoming an international master. Quite soon after that he began his push to go further and he scored his first grandmaster norm in a tournament in Holland. A real triumph came his way in the 1979 USSR Super League at Minsk where nine famous grandmasters were in contention for the Soviet title, amongst them Tal and Geller. Young Yusupov kept on level terms with them throughout and only Geller's fine play just outdistanced his rival who came second. The impression made on his teachers and commentators was immense, and they noted in particular his fine endgame play Here is an example in his win over Так White's advantage does not seem so great and you can only admire how Yusupov made use of this insignificant plus.

with exclamation marks. White intends to exchange queens since it is in the rook ending that he can best exploit his positional advantage.

To leave the pawn on e5 would let the white king come in via the white squares to e4 and thence either penetrate further on the ф -side or go over to win the a5 pawn so forming a winning passed pawn.

First of all he advances his passed pawn as far as possible to reduce the mobility of the enemy king and rook by the threat of queening. 41 . . . f5 After many hours of analysis Tal realised that passive play will lose. Thus if Black remains passive White advances the pawn to a6 with the threat of a7 followed by g g 8 + queening. This forces Black to keep his king on g6 or g7.

Harry Kasparov* Flohr had the quizzical comment 'As far as I can understand this game if Kasparov cannot yet be called an Academician yet the title of professor is certainly his already! This comment referred to a player who was only sixteen at the time yet had already an impressive list of tournament successes. Та I claimed that any success by the lad in the 1979 Super League would be a sensation In the event he shared 3rd-4th place with Balashov, yet it is no secret that some people expected even more from him, especially after his three wins at the start of the event. However the young man has not yet learned fully how to control his emotions and makes slips occasionally. Botvinnik's comment on this is that everyone makes slips from time to time The hard working Yusupov often has them, so Harry's occasional ones should not worry us especially, he will mature and they will disappear. In fact Kasparov's play has already made such an impression that his style and his victories are a talking point not just in the USSR but also abroad. His greatest success abroad was the spring 1979 Banja Luka tournament where he took first place ahead of a field of strong grandmasters including Petrosian, Andersson and Browne. His play was the high spot of the event and the spectators crowded in to watch him. We shall doubtless read many books and articles in the future about his play A guarantee of that is the continuing friendly contact which Kasparov is maintaining with Botvinnik He worked formally in the school for five years, and still regards himself as a pupil, in the sense that after nearly every game he phones up Botvinnik hoping to hear his mentor's praise, but also ready to hear with gratitude any critical comments that may come. Flohr points out that the young man is full of concentration and serious in his attitude. Some players prefer to walk round when it is the opponent's turn to move, and even chat (though not about the game in progress, of course) with friends and colleagues. Kasparov * Translator's Note Russian sources give the fust name as Gary or Garik but Kasparov has signed himself Harry ,n letters written m English to a Western publisher sits at the board and thinks in the way that Botvinmk used to Only when he has a clear advantage does he permit himself to get up and take a quick stroll round the stage. Then it is noticeable that he is nervous and excited and he has not yet learned how to hide this. The experts have some admiring comments to make about him though tinged at times with expectation. Petrosian, for example 'Harry is a great talent. In terms of talent I would compare him with Tal,but talent alone does not guarantee the highest achievements. A great deal will depend upon his reaction, especially how he reacts to the 'trial by fame". Despite his youth Kasparov has already played many fine games We select one of the latest from the 1979 Spartakiad where his 'marble' style was shown to perfection.

Black's chosen line cannot be approved - he has forced his knight to the edge of the board from where it does not get into play to the very end of the game. Possibly Black assumed that the spoiled white pawn formation was compensation for the distant knight Yet Kasparov has assessed the position more deeply. Apart from the knight at a6 there is the slightly awkward placing of the queen and the general lack of co-operation of the black pieces means that White is able to develop a threatening initiative. In fact the basis of White's pressure is the apparently weak pawns which create sound support for White's pieces. White could generate his pressure in various ways, one of which would be along the c-file. Instead the young master decides to act in the vicinity of the king and moves all his pieces in that direction. 19 ...

As for Sergei Dolmatov I cannot say that he has worked as hard, even though his results up to this event were good and he had just taken first place in the First League. The point is that for the Super League his theoretical 'baggage' was inadequate' These comments are valuable in their stress on independent work, the sort of critical comment that you rarely hear in the West after a failure by one of their grandmasters. Of course Dolmatov's shared 14th-15th place in the Top League even if shared with Tal was an unpleasant result for him. Botvinmk has this comment on his former pupil, 'Dolmatov studied with me for a year. He is a good tactician but has a poor understanding of position, and this is what he ought to work hard on'. One must hope that the talented Muscovite will overcome this

Here is what one of our strongest lady players has to say about herself, 'I am very fond of classical music, and listening to it is real relaxation for me during a tournament. It is a real delight for me to visit the ballet 'Giselle! I am also very keen to play tennis, which I play at a high level and love no less than chess. I regret the fact that I became familiar with this form of sport so late on. Generally speaking I devote a lot of attention to physical preparation, and this helps me to play better! Lena is now one of our strongest players, and competes not only against women, in which field she has won the grandmaster title, but also against men. She seems to have the ambition to emulate Nona Gaprindashvili who has the grandmaster title not just for her long tenure of women's world champion but also for play against men. Lena's comment on this, 'I have played in several men's tournaments. I am not satisfied with my results there, but I enjoyed playing. Men rarely make just good simple moves - they try to make moves which, while perhaps not being the very best then at least are really good ones. Playing with men is excellent training! Go through this game against Petrovich in the 1979 USSR- Yugoslavia match and in every one of White's moves you will see the triumph of strategic thought, accurate exploitation of insigni ficant advantages and inventiveness in attack. In some of the moves you are sure to detect 'the hand of Botvinnik' at work.

10 Kart's Chess School

Viktor Emmanuelovich Kart is nowadays a weli-known chess trainer and must be considered a surprising and unique phenomenon in chess, the like of which we have not seen before, and may be just as rare in the future. The point is that he is a player who never scored a victory in strong tournaments, never even approached grandmaster level in his playing standard and does not even have the master title. Yet he developed a whole group of outstanding grandmasters who have carried the fame of the Lvov school to all parts of the world. His pupils speak of him with such admiration. Oleg Romanishin was once asked who coached him now that he had the grandmaster title. His reply: 'My attitude in chess and my whole upbringing in the game are the product of Honoured Trainer of the Soviet Union Viktor Emmanuelovich Kart, and if there are any failings in this upbringing then the fault lies in the pupils, not in the teacher who is a marvellous, generous and outstanding pedagogue! Fine words of the sort that every teacher would like to hear from his charges, yet they do not explain fully the fruitful results of his work over the years. After all he has produced in the last decade a whole set of outstanding players, namely grandmasters Oleg Romanishin, Alexander Belyavsky, Iosif Dorfman, Adrian Mikhal- chishin, Martha Litinskaya and many other young masters. What are his methods, what does he concentrate on? His answer: 'The main feature of our work is very likely the development of character and love of hard work. Only strong characters are capable of producing top competitive results'. Confirmation of this is seen in the attitude of tough competition between the two most talented pupils of his Oleg Romanishin and Sasha Belyavsky. When the slightly younger Oleg gained the master title his achievement was soon matched by the then fourteen year old Belyavsky. Later on the same pattern was followed, as the two vied for various titles and top places in tournaments. Yet the spirit of competition between them did not prevent them remaining friends and working on chess together. Kart's Chess School 103 This creative competition between themselves is a marked feature of all Kart's pupils. Junior colleague Dvoretsky has drawn attention to Kart's success in developing the best sides to his pupils despite their different personalities and styles of play. I can confirm this and must express my admiration for the spirit of friendship, understanding and mutual respect which applies in this famous collective. When talking to Kart's pupils l am invariably struck by the feeling of love, clearly mutual, which is so noticeable among them with regard to their coach. Let us now examine some of the better known of Kart's pupils, who in recent years have joined the ranks of the strongest grandmasters in the world. Alexander Belyavsky Young Sasha feels that he was lucky in his childhood since he was only eight in 1961 when he learned how to play chess and joined the chess circle in the Lvov Palace of Pioneers run by V.L.Kart. The youngster's chess abilities were soon developed and the typical spirit of competition in the circle led to considerable success in events at city and republic level.* Later on he became a pupil at the Number 2 Specialist School where Kart was on the staff, and then he started scoring successes at national level. In 1973 Sasha Belyavsky became World Junior Champion at Teesside, England, a great achievement which normally presages entry to the top circle of international tournaments. Sasha soon confirmed his reputation as an outstanding talent by sharing first place in the 1974 Soviet Championship with Tal so winning the grandmaster title. His successes since then have been numerous and can be attributed first of all to his native talent and his scrupulous hard work at chess. He knows that to last out a tournament which might last getting on for a month you have to have good health and strong nerves. That is why his daily routine includes skiing in winter and tennis or swimming in summer. It is no coincidence that he graduated from the Lvov Institute of Physical Culture. Possibly his studies in higher education put a brake on his advancement as a player since from 1974 he has had his ups and downs. This decline has recently been halted and he has some recent successes which can only be called record-breaking such as the perfect score of 13 points out of 13 at the 1978 Alicante tournament in Spain, five clear points ahead of the next player! * Translator's Note Lvov is the largest city in the Western Ukraine (formerly part of Poland)

104 Kart's Chess School

Belyavsky spends a great deal of time on private study, so it will be interesting to hear his opinion about this aspect of chess training, especially as it is a weak point in many of the world's juniors and younger players. He has expressed his opinion thus: The difference between working at chess in the quiet of your study and during an actual game is very significant. It is hardly ever the case that you will achieve the level of concentration at home that applies during a game. This is because of the absence of the powerful stimulus supplied by the playing factor. As a result the great advantage of home study - the availability of a lot of time - is largely nullified. In any event whether it is a question of an actual game or home analysis, it is not useful to work at it more than five to six hours a day. After that the productivity of extra time put in is too low. Also what might take you a day in a tournament to work out takes two or three days at home! This comment is very interesting. Let us develop this line of thought further. Has the reader, I wonder, ever had to play games in the absence of an opponent, that is play against himself, making moves first for White and then for Black? Circumstances have been such that I have often found this the only method of training that I could use. How did it work out? No matter how I tried to be objective and forced myself to think as much for one side as for the other I could not easily maintain the right sort of attitude. Belyavsky has a comment on this too: 'The absence of a 'rejoinder' from an opponent often leads you into assuming things over the best move in home analysis. A chess player is hardly ever impartial. Even in analysis he is trying to find a win for White or a draw for Black. In the course of analysis his sympathies for one side may change, but will not disappear - impartiality is foreign to resea rch. There is a great deal of interest in these comments and they reveal Belyavsky's common sense, yet he seems to miss the most important point. No matter how you try in joint analysis with a favoured helper or experienced coach you will always see more and figure things out better on your own, than with the best helpers. There are many reasons for this, the greater concentration of thought by an individual, the nature of thought and perception in the human brain. Then there is the factor of responsibility. How many errors have occurred in the analysis of adjourned games, even at the highest level, because the analyst has assumed that if there was anything special in a given position it would be spotted by his collaborator By resting your faith in a collaborator you reduce the efficiency of your own work, and you fail to realise the simple fact that he is making the same assumption about you, is relying on you in the same facile way. Alexander Belya vsky 105 I always like to quote this example:- in 1967 at the Palma de Majorca tournament three of us, Botvmnik, Smyslov and I, always analysed the adjourned game together, during the ninety minute break. Or rather that is how the first hour was spent Then Botvinnik would ask us to leave him and in the half hour remaining before resumption of play he would complete the analysis himself. How different at times were the lines he went into by comparison with what the three of us had worked out! Belyavsky does not get discouraged by the fact that his analysis is not always accurate and that his tournament results are not as good as he would wish. His consolation is the comment that even Botvinnik once said that he learned how to do proper research work in chess only when he had reached the age of about thirty. So Belyavsky at the age of twenty-six still has some time to go. As to style of play Belyavsky is probably more universal in his approach than his other colleagues. He knows how to conduct a fierce attack on the king without counting the cost in sacrificed material, then next game he can put up a stubborn defence, then again, as in the game quoted below, he can show great mastery in weaving tricky patterns in a tricky endgame.

Oleg Romanishin A really embarrassing state of affairs occurred at the start of the USSR Super League, 1975, in Yerevan. A 23 year old master from Lvov scored seven wins against famous players. This master was Oleg Romanishin the European Junior Champion of 1973, and the list of his victims is as follows - Petrosian, Furman, Polugayevsky, Balashov, Geller, Aiburtand Klovan. Not just the wins were striking, but the manner of their achievement brought repeated bursts of applause from the audience. Romanishin was to give his own reaction later: 'A win gives one a feeling of self-affirmation, and success - a feeling of self-expression, but only a sensible harmonisation between these urges can bring really great achievements in chess! He has not always managed to score victories. His style tends towards the combinational and tactical, and it is well-known that this preference does not always result in first prizes in tournaments So we must concede that he has his ups and clowns, greater than in many contemporary leading players, but his style of play and the content which he puts into every move has gained the admiration of fans around the world. He has that rich gift of fantasy that enables him to discover fascinating new possibilities in the depths of Oleg Romanishin 107 chess. We will not go through his tournament performances - they are very great even though his supporters were gravely disappointed at his failure in the 1979 Soviet Zonal tournament. He really should have got into the Candidates by now. However he is sure to have many successes in the future, and his fans are confident that what has always delighted them most of all, his creative play, will continue. I thought a lot about which of his games to present to readers, and then decided simply to ask him what was his favourite game. He nominated his game against Petrosian at the Yerevan, 1975, Soviet Championship that we have already mentioned. Romanishm-Petrosian Queen's Indian Defence

Iosif Dorfman What can you say about the play of grandmaster Iosif Dorfman was a question I once put to my friend Salo Flohr. His answer was that this was an interesting, tough player, who had somehow recently fallen back. He had shared the gold medal of Soviet Champion and then begun to play unconvincingly. Weil such things do happen from time to time with younger players (and with older ones too, the reader may add). One can only hope that this talented pupil of Kart will be able to overcome the temporary crisis and will regain his best form. Evidence of his Iosif Dorfman 109 abilities is provided by the following game, Dorfman-Chekhov, Minsk, 1976. White exploits his advantages with a series of simple clear moves. 17 b4! # d 8 18 c5!

1979 Interzonal in Alicante, but took the chance of coming in as

reserve when one of the original qualifiers withdrew, and she won a dramatic match against the West German Giselle Fischdick after being 3-0 down! Such fighting spirit is perhaps a sign that she is overcoming the crisis and starting to play at her old strength. Her tactical awareness is seen in this game, Lysenko-Litinskaya, from the 1979 USSR Zonal tournament.

11 Karseladze's Chess School

We have already mentioned the remarkable nature of the Kart school in that a player without even the master title developed a whole series of grandmasters. No less surprising is the other chess school which we now deal with, this time in Georgia. This is the school of V.Karseladze. We must be honest and say that the Caucasian republic has not yet produced a single player of world class, though they have well- known grandmasters in T.Georgadze, B.Gurgemdze and E.Gufeld (who learned his chess in the Ukraine). Yet in the ranks of the players of the Georgian Chess Federation we find many of the best players in the world amongst women, and the women's world title has been held for almost two decades by a Georgian. In 1962 the famous Nona Gaprindashvili won the world title. As yet she is the only player to hold the grandmaster title both for play against men and against women. Recently she has not had an easy time of it amongst women and her challengers for the world title have been her fellow Georgians. In 1975 she beat off the challenge of Nana Alexandria, but three years later she had to surrender the title to the then sixteen year old Maya Chiburdamdze. What lies in the future? The present champion is Chiburdanidze while her eight challengers in the 1980 series of knock-out matches include no less than four representatives of Georgia - the legendary Gaprindashvili, Nana Alexandria and the young players Nana loselani and Nini Gurieli, all four of them grandmasters1 How can one explain this flowering of female talent in the Caucasus republic, and the uneven development as regards men and women players there? There seem to be two reasons - the active and dedicated work of the late Vakhtang Karseladze who brought on Nona Gaprindashvili and then the example of the world champion herself on the next generation. She is very popular in her native land, and it is no surprise that from their earliest years Georgian girls try to follow her example. Connoisseurs note the special features of the style of the Georgian lady players - the depth of their strategic concepts, their Karsetadze's Chess School 113 excellent understanding of position, all reinforced by tactical inventiveness. This is confirmed in the examples we now give from This is Gaprindashvili-Chiburdanidze, 4th match game, 1978 Teenager Maya (Black) plays an interesting pawn sacrifice to exploit White's poor piece placement and the weakness of the central squares. 20 .. £}b4! 21 Д Х Ь 4 cb 22 gfe1 Refusal of the sacrifice makes White's position even weaker.

We have described the play of the 'graduates' of the three main Soviet schools. Yet we have two other significant schools which are remarkable by way of the fame of their heads. Some years ago the students' sports association Burevestnik organised a school under the direction of ex-world champion Vasily Smyslov and a similar school for young talents has been created for Spartak headed by another ex-champion Tigran Petrosian. Both schools work on the same sort of basis as the Botvinnik school, but whether this system will suit them and what sort of 'product' we shall have from their endeavours only time will show. As yet their activity has not been going on long enough for us to judge them. However the obvious desire of our leading figures to pass on their knowledge to the younger generation is there. In this respect Petrosian's comments are worth quoting: 'I consider that in chess it is possible to learn everything. That is what I believe and in my heart of hearts I cherish the dream that some day I will come across a pupil to whom I can pass on all that I know, all that I learned by dint of hard search after truth. I hope to bring on such a youngster who could work jointly with me in various researches and who could then try these out in actual play. Yet though I have not yet come across such a player I am still living in hope and like the work with youngsters. The school has been working for almost three years and there are some successes. Borya Kantser from Frunze has become USSR Junior Champion, while two lads, Kuporosov and Novikov, have reached the master norm! We can only wish our veterans good luck in the passing on of their immense experience to the young thereby making a serious contribution to the further development and popularisation of the game. Obviously studies under such conditions are a serious way of aiming for the top, but there are some of our players who have managed without long forma! schooling and still scored top-class results. We devote the remaining part of the book to some of these independent talents who have done it all on their own, or had only

short contact with teachers who are not well known. In this respect pride of place should probably go to the very talented girl from Leningrad who has three times been Soviet Ladies' Champion Irina Levitina What seemed the key game, against world title holder Maya Chiburdamdze, was lost by Irina in annoying circumstances, by a mistake in the adjourned session in what was a comparatively simple position. Then came a 'reaction' - six wins in a row, and not against weak players either. This was the 1979 USSR Championship at Tbilisi, and brought Levitina her third gold medal as USSR Champion, a remarkable achievement at the age of only twenty- five. The first win came in 1971, the second in 1978. There seems little doubt that we shall see her amongst the challengers one day for the world crown. Her style of play is marked by imagination, bold energetic approach and combinational inventiveness. These natural qualities were partly developed by her long association with mentor Pavel Kondratyev. To see them examine a position together in total harmony is to realise what a future lies before her. The best side of her fighting qualities is seen in this game against Larisa Muchmk in the 1979 Soviet Championship.

The Yerevan grandmaster Rafael Vaganyan is one example and we have seen what he is capable of in the fine combination against Reshevsky (see diagram 25). Two players associated with the Urals and Siberia are grand masters Vitaly Tseshkovsky (who shared first place in the Soviet Championship of 1978 with Mikhail Tal and just failed to get to the Candidates in the Manila Interzonal of 1976) and Yevgeny Sveshmkov. The aggressive play of both men has won them many supporters. Vitaly Tseshkovsky This is Tseshkovsky-Belyavsky from the 1978 First League of the Soviet Championship.

Yevgeny Sveshnikov Grandmaster Yevgeny Sveshnikov from Chelyabinsk, alas, has combined periods of great success with awful failures, yet this cheerful young man never loses heart. You will often hear him criticising his own play and himself. This is a good sign as seif- criticism is the necessary preliminary to putting matters right. What he is capable of at his best is shown in this game from the Top League, 1978, at Ashkhabad.

Both of them are 'self-taught' in the sense that though their early efforts were encouraged by teachers their more recent climb to the top is the result of individual effort.
