This is reflected in the fact that chess-players at all levels devote the greatest part of their study to what are called 'openings' . Put simply, openings are sequences of early moves; we'll discuss exactly what qualifies as an opening as we go along. Players normally study the openings that may potentially appear in their own games. After all, nobody wants to incur a disadvantage before the game warms up, and every chess-player would like to gain an advantage over his opponent right out of the blocks. Thus we find in the chess literature vast numbers of books about particular openings and open ing systems. More has been written about the initial phase of the game than about any other chess topic, whether the middlegame, endgame, history, strategy, attack or defence. There are also encyclopaedias, magazines, CDs, DVDs, videos, and websites devoted solely to opening moves. We refer to such material in general as 'opening theory' or simply 'theory'. Within most fundamen tal openings there are seemingly countless subsystems (called 'variations') and still further divi sions of material into ' subvariations' . It is not uncommon to see large books devoted exclusively to variations or even subvariations. Fortunately, openings are usually named, so we can communicate about them without explicitly having to restate, for example, the first nine moves played by both sides. Among these myriad books and products, very few are devoted to explaining the ideas, strate gies, and interconnections of chess openings taken as a whole. That is, individual theoretical books concentrate upon a single opening's moves and variations, and most discuss why some of those moves are good or bad. A fair number of these books will also examine basic strategies underlying the opening in question, which is important and beneficial. But few give a feeling for the common threads that underlie opening play or the reasons why opening strategies can differ so radically. In the book before you (and Volume 2 of this project), I seek to provide a durable standpoint from which to view the opening phase of the game. Then, regardless of the uncertainties of theory, you should be able to find your way through many of the problems posed by unfamiliar moves. As I began work on this book it became obvious that even in two large volumes it wouldn't be possible to cover every opening, nor even the most significant variations of every opening, and still achieve the insights that I hoped to convey. On the other hand, I have sought here to provide a start ing-point for players of all strengths to be able to understand these openings. Regardless of what anyone says, that simply can't be done without particulars, i.e. investigation of moves, alternatives, and annotated examples. What's more, those particulars must be comprehensible within some framework of general chess knowledge. In the end, I decided to begin the book with three chapters covering fundamental ideas of opening play. The first chapter presents elementary concepts shared by all openings. In the next two chapters, I incorporate motifs and structures that will inform your study as you proceed to specifics. The greater part of the book is devoted to a selection of individual openings (king's pawn open ings in the case of this book; Volume 2 will focus on queen's pawn openings). These openings are examined from the ground up, which is to say that each chapter begins with an explanation of the very basics of strategy. I shall often show what happens when you play alternatives that are inferior to the generally approved moves. As the chapter progresses, established variations are explored, sometimes in considerable detail, in order to establish the ideas and themes that characterize each opening and to investigate the extent to which they resemble other opening complexes. At the begin ning of each section I've paid special attention to move-order issues. Students are often perplexed
10 MASTERING THE CHESS OPENINGS
by move-orders, which frequently determine whether they get the opening position that they're aiming for. Choosing which systems and variations to investigate proved an extremely difficult task. I de cided to concentrate upon the most 'important' openings, that is, the ones which are and have been the centre of theory and practice for decades. Obvious examples are the Ruy Lopez, Sicilian De fence and Queen's Gambit. Within those and other major opening systems, I have selected a lim ited number of variations that are, I believe, enlightening in strategic terms. I have also examined some less prominent openings which not only have uniquely interesting properties but also lend themselves to comparisons with more popular systems. You may find that structures and ideas from superficially contrasting openings overlap more than you think. Finally, I explore how these openings and their variations fit into the general contours of a chess game. It is important to under stand that the games and analysis do not always represent current theory; they are intended to illus trate underlying properties of the opening. What are the rewards for studying openings and understanding the ideas associated with them? Well, it's always nice to gain an early advantage over your opponent, as I mentioned above. But such study has more valuable and far-reaching effects: it benefits your general chess knowledge in a way that reading abstract books on strategy can't. The more thorough your investigation into openings, the better your understanding of the play that occurs after the opening. To begin with, many characteristics of openings, including typical strategies and tactics, endure throughout the middlegame, so your deeper understanding of them will translate to your overall success. In addi tion, the typical pawn-structures established by an opening will persist as we enter into simplified positions and even endgames. This book assumes a basic level of playing competence. Nevertheless, those who know the rules, have played a bit, and are willing to put some effort into their chess study will do well. You need not have advanced much beyond the initial playing stage to understand the basic ideas presented here. All of Chapter 1 , most of Chapter 2, and the introductions to the chapters on individual openings are designed to help in that regard. I have also woven fundamental ideas into the analysis of specific openings, attempting to begin my presentation at a lower level and then proceed to the more ad vanced concepts needed for substantial improvement. After years of exploring the initial phase of the game, I have come to an important and, I think, encouraging conclusion: every well-established opening is playable. That is not to say that all openings lead to full equality, nor that all speculative gambits will lend themselves to acceptable outcomes. But with sufficient study and understanding, any opening system that masters play, even on a periodic basis, will serve you well enough to get you to the rniddlegame in decent shape. Un der those circumstances, the result of the game will not be decided by your choice of the first 5-10 moves, whether against a club opponent orin top competition. Players on all levels have an under standable tendency to follow the latest fashions, and that can lead to the notion that openings not currently being played are substandard. It's much more likely that those openings are simply out of favour or running into difficulties against some esoteric move within a complicated variation. There are many variations and even whole opening systems that have been declared inferior but were then taken up again by the world's best players. When in doubt, look up the number of grand masters who play one 'bad' opening or another. This will encourage you to approach your explora tions with an open mind. I hope that this book will reward your careful study and give you a new perspective on openings and on the game of chess itself.
1 The Nature of Chess Openings:
Fundamentals The first moves of a chess game can be played in random fashion, or they can be organized so as to form a coherent strategy. Chess is above all a game of logic and planning, so the player who coordinates his moves towards an end will almost always defeat an opponent whose moves have no purpose or are inconsistent. This book concerns itself with initial moves that make sense together and attempts to explain the rea soning underlying those moves. The first order of business will be to clarify the scope of our investigation and to orientate ourselves in the world of openings. Then we shall look at some rudimentary ideas underpin ning successful opening play. What is an Opening? Generally speaking, an opening is defined by the introductory moves of a chess game. An open ing begins on move one. The obvious question that suggests itself is surprisingly difficult to answer: how do we decide on what move an opening ends and the middlegame begins ? There i s n o general agreement among players or authors about this; in many cases it turns out to be a subjective judgement informed by play ing experience. In this book I shall define open ings (and their variations) as sequences of moves that are specifically named, with the name in common chess usage and sometimes referring to a complex of related positions. The advan tage of using this convention is that we can know precisely at which move an opening or variation ends. For instance, the 'English Open ing' is defined by a single white move: l c4. The 'Sicilian Defence' consists of l e4 c5. And the variation called the 'Najdorf Variation of the Sicilian Defence' is delimited by the moves
1 e4 c5 2 tll
f3 d6 3 d4 cxd4 4 tll xd4 tll f6 5 tll c3 a6. By defining the word 'opening' to designate moves with names that are in general usage, we avoid dealing with such near-irrational se quences as 1 a4 e5 2 f3, which do not fall within the category of openings as I have defined them. There are very few meaningful openings that are unnamed, but I shall touch upon them if the occasion arises. Most of this book is divided into major open ings which can be identified within four moves or fewer; for example, the Ruy Lopez ( 1 e4 e5 2 tll f3 tll c6 3 i.b5), or the Griinfeld Defence (1 d4 tll f6 2 c4 g6 3 tll c3 d5), each of which then subdivides into 'variations' . Named variations of openings can be of almost any length; for ex- ample, the Closed Variation of the Sicilian De fence has just two moves: 1 e4 c5 2 tll c3; and the Exchange Variation of the Ruy Lopez (also known as the 'Spanish Game') consists of the four moves 1 e4 e5 2 tll f3 tll c6 3 i.b5 a6 4 i.xc6. Lasker's Variation of the Queen's Gam bit is distinguished by the seven moves 1 d4 d5
2 c4 e6 3 tll
c3 tll f6 4 i.g5 i.e7 5 e3 O-O 6 tll f3 h6 7 i.h4 tll e4 (D). w But some variations stem from other varia tions, which can stem from still others, and so forth. For example, the Chinese Variation of the
12 MASTERING THE CHESS OPENINGS
Dragon Sicilian evolves from this move-order:
1 e4 c5 (this is the 'Sicilian Defence' ) 2 l2Jf3 d6
3 d4 cxd4 4 l2Jxd4 lLif6 5 l2Jc3 g6 (the moves
thus far are known as the 'Dragon Variation' ) 6 i..e3 i..g7 7 f3 l2Jc6 8 �d2 (these first eight moves define the 'Yugoslav Attack') 8 ...
O-O 9
i..c4 (some authors refer to this as the ' i.. c4 Yu goslav Attack') 9 ... i..d7 1 0 O-O-O and now with 10 ... J:;tbS (D), we have arrived at the 'Chinese Variation of the Dragon Sicilian' . If some of this is confusing, you shouldn't worry: it will become clear as we work our way through the book. In this general scheme the word 'theory' is used to indicate specific moves that have been previously played or analysed, and are known by a significant portion of the chess commu nity, usually via publications or databases. In most but not all cases we can think of theory as representing the end of the opening phase of the game but not the opening itself. Theory can therefore extend far into the game because peo ple all over the world repeatedly play the same opening and consistently add to what is known about it. Theoretical discussions sometimes deal with the 20th move of a variation or even fur ther into the game, but most opening theory typically ends on a move in the teens, and the theory of a lesser-known variation may end af ter only six or seven moves. The opening has certain characteristics that distinguish it from the other parts of the game, especially from the endgame. In the opening a large majority of the pieces and pawns are still on the board. In this situation, it is quite possi ble that in each position there are two, three or more moves that are of equal worth, so we can not decide in practice or even with hindsight whether one move actually achieves more than another. Even if a hypothetical supercomputer could solve the position, the end result of either move would usually be the same - for example, a draw. Thus a player may have a wide choice that is more a matter of taste and playing style than of objective quality. We can contrast this situation with another part of the game - the endgame. In most endgames, particularly those with just a few pieces on the board, we can es tablish precisely what the ultimate effect of a particular move would be. Consequently, very few moves will be made simply because they suit someone' s style of play. You should also note that players can usually make one or two inaccuracies in the opening and still not be punished with a lost position. By contrast, a single mistake in a king and pawn endgame, for example, may be fatal, and punishment can come quickly for even a small endgame inaccuracy. Thus, many reasonable looking decisions in the endgame are unam biguously right or wrong and can be demon strated to be so. In the opening, however, a player has more leeway, which means that he is able to approach positions more creatively, without needing to calculate variations out to a win or loss. This in tum allows players of any strength to come up with worthwhile new opening moves. Openings are also more for giving with respect to static features of play: the earlier in the game that you take on a bad bishop or pawn weakness, for example, the more likely it is that you can solve the associ ated problems. Furthermore, there are many opening positions that are chaotic and defy useful generalization. It should not be surprising that the middle game shares features with both the opening and endgame. Middlegame play tends to include more immediately critical decisions than open ing play and middlegame mistakes are fre quently life-threatening. An inaccurate attack or defence can lead to instant defeat and posi tional problems tend to be harder to resolve. On the other hand, most middlegame moves will not radically alter the strategic character of the position. Even allowing for the heightened possibility of irreparable error, the majority of
THE NATURE OF CHESS OPENINGS: FUNDAMENTALS 13
middlegame positions are still flexible enough to support more than one functional move and, sometimes, more than one strategy. Setting these details aside, what is extremely important and should be a part of your chess thinking is this: most features of a game, out side of material loss or catastrophic setback, can be changed or will evolve of their own ac cord as the game goes from opening to end game. Mastering the opening is to some extent recognition of this fact and adaptation to it. Elementary Properties of Openings We now look at just a few fundamental fea tures of opening play. These are presented on a very basic level to provide some tools and vo cabulary with which you can advance to the next chapters and at least partially understand specific opening discussions. The experienced player may want to skip this material alto gether. The terms and ideas presented here are used throughout the book. For this first chapter, the assumption is that you know the rules of the game, can follow chess notation, and know ba sic chess terms such as 'file', 'diagonal', 'pin', and so forth. You should also understand the relative value of the pieces and how much 'material' both sides have in terms of relative strength (counting points is the best way to start). Finally, you should have played enough to be comfortable with a discussion of chess formations. A vast array of ideas and advice for the inexperienced is given by books, electronic material, and web sites; what I'm presenting in stead is an extremely abbreviated version of in troductory material. Some of what you'll be reading involves definitions of terms, which will probably bore you but are necessary if you're going to understand the fun parts later. The Centre Every opening has unique characteristics in cluding pawn-structure, typical tactics, and di verse methods of attack and defence. But all openings have one consideration in common when it comes to organizing one's pieces: cen tral configuration and control. The centre is a primary concern in deciding how to proceed with your plans, not to mention your next move. I have placed this section about the centre be fore the one on development of the pieces be cause it provides a foundation for everything that follows in this book. As you read the chap ters on specific openings you will run into more commentary about the centre than about any other subject, so it's important to familiarize yourself with the related concepts. The four squares in the middle of the board (e4, d4, e5 and d5) are traditionally called the 'centre'. The value of the centre can be seen by imagining a piece on a central square on an otherwise empty board. Queens, bishops and knights all control more points from the centre than if they were placed on a non-central square. When we then include the bordering squares (e3, d3, c4, c5, d6, e6, f4, f5), we sometimes use the phrase 'extended centre'. Notice that if pawns occupy the bordering squares they can contribute to control of the cen tre proper (the middle four squares). Normally when I speak of the 'centre', I'll be referring to the four inside squares, but you may also want to think about the border squares when I speak about 'central control'. There's more jargon that you'll get used to as you see specific examples. One player's pawns on central squares are said to be 'his centre'. For instance, we might say that White's centre in the top diagram overleaf consists of the white pawns occupying d4 and e5. In the position in the lower diagram, Black may be said to have a broad centre (or 'central front'), describing his pawns on c5, d5, e5 and f5.
14 MASTERING THE CHESS OPENINGS
To confuse things a bit more, the phrase 'centre pawns' also denotes pawns that occupy any square along the central corridors from e2 to e7 or d2 to d7. Don't worry: none of this need be memorized. It may just help a little as you go along. On occasion I shall use the phrase 'ideal cen tre', which refers to having pawns on e4 and d4 when you are playing with the white pieces, or pawns on e5 and d5 when you play Black. We call that the ideal centre because of all the pos sible first two moves, the advances d4 and e4 as White (or ... d5 and ...e5 as Black) give your pieces the most freedom to move about, and therefore to have the greatest influence on the game. The player with the ideal centre can also more easily add to his control of the four central squares. For instance, he might place his pieces as in the following diagram. White controls the central square e5 three times (with two pieces and a pawn), d5 three times, d4 twice and e4 once. His pieces are de veloped and active. Both bishops have six moves available in front of the 2nd rank and both knights can go to three such squares. Here are some examples of the ideal centre versus some not-so-ideal centres. Suppose a game begins with these moves:
1 d4 a5
This is a common beginner's move, hoping to bring a rook out via a6. 2 e4 Now if 2 ... J:;ta6, White will simply capture the rook. 2 ••• h5 3 tllc3 tlla6 4 tllf3 g6 5 .i.c4 J:;tb7 6 .ilf4 tllh6 (D) We can see how Black has neglected the cen tre. In fact, none of his pieces control d4, e4, d5 or e5. White has by far the better position. Even if Black plays more reasonably and de velops his pieces in the centre, he can get in trouble for lack of central control. A simple ex ample, again using the ideal centre for White:
1 e4 e6 2 d4 d6 3 tllf3 tllf6 4 tllc3 tllc6 5
.ilc4 .ile7 6 .ilf4 .ild7 (D)
THE NATURE OF CHESS OPENINGS: FUNDAMENTALS 15
At least Black has established some influence over the centre, but neither of his pawns has reached the fourth rank; his pieces are cramped behind their own lines. Compare Black's bish ops, which have only two retrograde moves available to them, with White's bishops, which can reach 8 squares apiece. And while Black's knights are actively placed, White's superior centre can chase them away by means of the pawn advances d5 or e5. White has a distinct advantage. What went wrong for Black? He needed to challenge White's centre with his own pawns, bringing one of them to d5 or e5 to break up White's ideal centre and establish ter ritory of his own. Let's take a look at a variety of common openings with respect to central control. You will see the universal emphasis on controlling central points. For each move of a pawn or piece I have indicated the corresponding cen tral squares that it controls (or helps to control) in brackets: a) In what is called the Italian Game, note that every move for both sides controls at least one main central square: 1 e4 [controlling d5] 1 . • .eS [d4] 2 lZ'lf3 [d4 and e5] 2 . . • lZ'lc6 [d4 and e5] 3 i.c4 [d5]. Black typically responds with the 'Giuoco Piano' , 3 ••• i.cS [d4], or 3 . • • lZ'lf6 [e4 and d5], the Two Knights. b) The Ruy Lopez (or 'Spanish' ) goes 1 e4 [d5] 1 ••• eS [d4] 2 lZ'lf3 [d4 and e5] 2• . • l2Jc6 [d4 and e5], and now 3 .i.bS attacks a piece that controls d4 and e5, thus indirectly reducing Black's influence over them. c) The Queen's Gambit Declined: 1 d4 [e5]

a bishop to g2, b2, g7 or b7); this move is also for the sake of central control; for instance: e) The English Opening: 1 c4 [d5] 1. .•e5 [d4] 2 l2Jc3 [e4 and d5] 2 ... l2Jc6 [d4 and e5] 3 g3 g6 4 i..g2 [e4 and d5] 4 ... .ilg7 [d4 and e5] 5 d3 [e4] 5 ...d6 [e5] 6 lLif3 [d4 and e5] 6 ... f5 [e4] 7 O-O l2Jf6 [e4 and d5]. To be fair, half of the initial moves of a knight and all those of the middle four pawns control some central square, so one might think that central control practically takes care of it self. But the openings above show that the mas ters who developed them intended to occupy and control central squares in a continuous and harmonious way. To a strong player, a particu lar central structure calls out to the pieces and indicates where they should go. Then the pawns and pieces control the key squares while they are safely defended and work together. This co ordination of pieces leads to the next subject. Development Another critical but simpler opening idea is called 'development' . This refers to moving pieces (not including pawns) off their initial squares and putting them 'in play'. Just count ing the number of pieces that you have moved is the simplest measure of development. Of course it's essential to consider the 'quality' of development, that is, how well the pieces are placed. There are some principles of good de velopment, which are unfortunately limited by the context of each position, first and foremost by the pawn-structure. Nevertheless, as you first get used to playing chess you will do well most of the time to: a) get as many pieces developed (off their initial squares) as possible, preferably early in the game; b) bring those pieces to active squares where they have good scope (without subjecting them to attack, of course); and c) coordinate your developed pieces with the centre, working with pawns to control as many central squares as you can. Usually you can't achieve everything that you want to, but by keeping these principles in mind you will have a better chance of gaining the advantage. In order to develop efficiently, it's often de sirable to move each piece only once or twice until they're all in useful positions. Also, be careful about bringing the queen out early in the game, because she is sometimes subject to attack and will have to retreat. The difference between the queen and other pieces in this re gard is that the queen can't be exchanged for most other pieces (the exception being for an other queen) without losing a lot of material, so in many situations she has to run away from the threat of capture and waste time. Here's a short game that combines the con cepts of centre and development: Estrin - Libov Moscow 1944

Black resigns because he will lose his queen after dxe7+ or i.xe7+. Ouch! The moral of the story is that Black ne glected to challenge White's centre and then had to move his knights too many times in the opening. King Safety One of the most important guidelines in chess is to protect your king from harm. This elemen tary consideration is sometimes forgotten. It can strongly affect the proper conduct of the opening stage of the game. The most common method of enhancing a king's security is castling, but it should be done with eyes wide open. The goal is usually to pro vide pawn-cover for the king, as in this skeletal view: White's king is sheltered and relatively safe. The squares f3, g3 and h3 are all protected from a piece intrusion, nor can the king be di rectly attacked along diagonals by a bishop or queen, or along files by a rook or queen. If Black does manage to capture one of White's pawns, that reduces the king's safety, but at least the other two pawns are still around for the king to hide behind. Black's uncastled king, however, is subject to checks, perhaps by a knight on d6 or c7, from a bishop on b5 or c6, a rook on e l or a8, or a queen from several di rections. Nevertheless, pawn-cover for the king may be more than overshadowed by the aggressive placement of the opponent's pieces towards the kingside (or queenside, if that is where castling is contemplated). A position from a famous game illustrates the point: Em. Lasker - Bauer Amsterdam 1889

Strong players have no fear of leaving their kings in the centre if that is the safest place on the board, or if by doing so the king contributes to the defence of weak or potentially weak squares. Sometimes an opening is even based upon the useful position of the king. Also, when an opening becomes rapidly simplified, the king may remain in the centre to assist with the end game. Centralized kings will generally be strong pieces in an endgame, but here one must beware. If only the queens have been exchanged, or if only the queen and one or two pairs of other pieces have been exchanged, then the king can still be hounded before a true ending arrives. This is the sort of decision that comes with expe rience. Space and Its Properties The amount of territory that is under one's con trol, generally referred to as space, is a concept that is deceptively hard to understand. The first point to be made is that having space is an ad vantage more often than not. It gives you more room to organize your forces and with luck it will frustrate your opponent, who will have dif ficulty getting his forces out. When you control more territory you can often move your pieces from one theatre of action to another more quickly than your opponent can, and thus attack on that front before he can defend. Some great players have spent their careers playing open ings that emphasized the control of space over any other factor, even the assumption of weak nesses in their position or difficulties with their development. In many situations I shall simply assume without explanation that the side with space has an advantage, although in other cases space may be a problem that needs to be overcome! For example, the possessor of more territory has more of the board to defend. That may seem trivial, but some positions are well-known for the property that the player with less space ties down the one with more space by constantly threatening to change the pawn-structure in his own favour if his opponent tries to do anything . Several variations of the Sicilian Defence, the most popular opening in chess, include lines in which something of that nature occurs. Since space is usually defined as a portion of the board that is delineated by pawns, one question that needs to be answered is whether those pawns are true boundaries or simply a temporary construct that can be neutralized. For example, pawns can be overextended in the opening such that the squares behind the pawns are compromised and pawn advances do not correspond to control of space. Con sider this position from the King's Indian Four Pawns Attack:
THE NATURE OF CHESS OPENINGS: FUNDAMENTALS 19
White's pawn penetration into Black's posi tion defines White's territory and he has an in disputable advantage in space. He also occupies more of the centre. But occupation and control are two different things and the possibility of undermining the advanced pawns can make them unstable. For instance, the play from the diagram might continue 7 ... tb.d7 8 h4?! (White stakes out even more territory and tries to attack the king by playing h5; however, he is making too many pawn moves when he should be de fending the space that he has grabbed in the centre) 8 ... c5! (this is referred to as 'undermin ing White's centre'; regardless of what White does, his pawns will be cleared away) 9 exd6 l:te8 IO dxe7 l:txe7+ 11 i.e2 cxd4 12 tb.xd4 lb.b6 13 tb.f3 i.f5 14 �xd8+ l:txd8 (D). At this point Black controls every central square and threatens ... tb.b4, while at the same time White's bishops are running into their own pawns. It turns out that Black has a win ning position because, ironically, he controls the centre. You can see how positively that af fects his development and activity. Regardless of the mediocre quality of play in this example, the lesson remains: if you seize a large hunk of the centre in the first moves of the game, make sure that you can defend the pawns that control that territory. The concept of space advantage is only significant when the pawns and pieces begin to assume more settled posi tions. By contrast, look at this example from one of the main lines of the same King's Indian De fence: It's already fair to say that Black has staked out territory and has space on the kingside whereas White has space on the queenside. Surely enough, a few moves later we might see something like: There's no question of who has secured terri tory on which side of the board.
10 MASTERING THE CHESS OPENINGS
In numerous openings we'll be talking about who has a space advantage, and what it means in terms of the assessment of the position. Piece Characteristics Some fairly elementary terminology disguises much more complex issues that will come up in the next few chapters. But it's worth dis cussing a few representative terms with respect to pieces. First of all, we have a couple of terms to de scribe knights and bishops. They are called 'minor pieces', in contrast to the rooks and queen, which are called 'major pieces'. I shall regularly refer to the advantage of the 'bishop pair' or 'two bishops' in this book. This reflects the fact that in every stage of the game, includ ing the opening, having two bishops on the board versus two knights or a bishop and a knight more often than not constitutes a mean ingful advantage. That emphatically qualified statement reflects the fact that, in a consider able minority of cases, the player who pos sesses two knights or a knight and bishop will have the advantage over, or at least stand equally with, his opponent who possesses two bishops. Nevertheless, those instances are in the minor ity, and when the bishop-pair is a recognizable advantage I shall often point that out. Likewise, if the bishops are hemmed in and/or the knights are in excellent positions, that will frequently be mentioned. Much of the time, however, I hope that the reader will come to notice all these imbalances on his or her own. So why are the two bishops so good in tan dem? First and foremost, because they cover squares of both colours. The bishop is a power ful, long-range piece that in a sense 'should' be better than the knight because it can attack from afar; but unlike a knight, a bishop can only travel on one colour. With two bishops that dis advantage is partially corrected. But another considerable advantage is that the possessor of the bishops can exchange one or even both of the knights under favourable circumstances, i.e. dictate when and where he can exchange other pieces to advantage. It is difficult for the short hopping knight to track down and exchange a bishop that is performing magnificently (or ful filling some essential function), but a bishop of the right colour can exchange a knight from afar. Thus the two bishops can do more than simply control squares. There follow some elementary properties of the pieces, and advice regarding their use in the opening. Most readers will find them almost self-evident, but this chapter is primarily de signed to help the inexperienced player become comfortable with ideas that we'll be referring to later.
1. Bishops like open diagonals and should
usually be developed accordingly. You may also use your bishop to pin an enemy piece, or to unpin your own. Exchanging your bishop for a knight is reasonable, but do so only to gain some advantage (or if forced to), otherwise you will be surrendering the advantage of the bishop-pair for no return. Although there are many exceptions to this in various openings, try not to let your bishops become trapped behind their own pawns with out good reason. Having said that, limiting a bishop's activity may be necessary to ensure that your knights, rooks and remaining bishop secure good positions.
2. Knights also need as much freedom of
movement as possible, but only to the extent that they don't unduly interfere with the ac tivity of other pieces. For that reason, you may see knights developed on the second rank or on the side of the board with their first move, in stead of to one of the 'ideal' squares f3, c3, f6 or c6. Knights are particularly fond of outposts, which arise in many openings. An outpost is a place in the opponent's pawn-structure where your piece cannot be attacked by a pawn. To have significance, an outpost should be on at least your 4th rank, and preferably on the 5th or 6th rank. From an outpost on a central file, a knight can exert considerable influence on sev eral squares in the enemy position while main taining defensive coverage. Here's an example of an outpost that's occupied by a knight (see upper diagram on following page): The defining feature of the outpost is that the knight can't be captured by a pawn. Its influ ence would be further strengthened by a rook or queen on the d-file, or by another knight on c3 or e3.
THE NATURE OF CHESS OPENINGS: FUNDAMENTALS 21
In the lower diagram Black's knight is on an outpost that is unsupported by his own pawns yet not subject to attack by the opponent's pawns. Notice that Black could also occupy this outpost with a dark-squared bishop, rook, or queen. Support for the eS-knight could come from rooks on the open file, another knight, a bishop on f6 or d6, and various placements of Black's queen. This is a real-world example: Black has an outpost on d5. Some students will say that White's knight has an outpost on e5, but notice that if Black's knight moves from f6, he could then attack the knight with a pawn by .. .f6. In stead, the e5-square is sometimes called a 'support-point' because it is supported by his d4-pawn and unlikely to be driven away by a pawn in the near future. Knights are sometimes just as happy to reside on a support-point as they are to occupy an outpost. The outpost and support-point are examples of structural configurations, a subject that we expand upon in Chapter 2 and still more Chap ter 3.
3. Rooks like to have open files, preferably
ones that extend vertically as far as possible into the enemy camp. Early pawn exchanges will sometimes let rooks breathe and have im mediate effect upon the game. In the opening, assuming that you castle in one direction or an other, your rooks may well end up on half-open files (ones blocked by your own pawns). If they can be centralized so as either to defend your e or d-pawns or to assist in their advance, that's also not a bad role. Doubling rooks (placing one behind the other on an open file) used to be uncommon in the opening stage, but since openings extend further and further into what was previously called the middle game, you'll definitely run across that situation. Likewise with the placement a rook on the seventh rank, which isn't generally possible until after the opening, but does occur, usually to assist in an attack. Rook-lifts to the third rank, on the other hand, happen relatively frequently; often they will move horizontally to help with an attack on the opponent's king. Another common rook-lift in the opening is to the second rank, because a rook which moves horizontally along the second rank can defend extremely sensitive squares such as the ones immediately in front of the king. This 'second-rank defence' is essential against some attacks, and such rooks may also be able to swing to the e- and d-files to support the centre.
4. Apart from wide-open games in which
the centre pawns are blown off the board early on, the queen tends to stay at home or
22 MASTERING THE CHESS OPENINGS
to lurk behind her pawns and pieces in the early stages of the opening. Increasingly, advanced players are bringing the queen out early but in a judicious manner to control more of the board - a practice that you'll see in this book. There's nothing wrong with exchanging queens in the opening, but there's also no reason to go out of your way to do so, as so many young players do. Activity and Initiative I shall refer time and again to a player's active pieces and to activity in general. This is a con cept that may encompass a coordination of forces, but to a first approximation simply ex presses the mobility and reach of one's pieces. Active pieces control more squares. Such pieces aren't necessarily involved in a direct attack but can serve to harass opposing forces, support a pawn advance, and generally accrue more terri tory. You will see that in opening play the active player tends to get the better game, in part because active pieces tend to force slower ones onto the defensive, resulting in the creation of weaknesses in the enemy camp. The balance that generally exists between attack and de fence in chess will break down if one player is working with direct threats and gaining more control of the board. Gathering momentum like this is called 'having the initiative'. As long as the aggressor is able to force his opponent to keep reacting to threats, he will maintain his initiative. Sometimes the initiative peters out, especially if handled poorly; it can even change hands. In this book, you will run across an as sessment of mine that reads simply 'Black has the initiative'. While it is ambiguous how much advantage that confers on Black, the initiative constitutes an advantage in and of itself. This chapter has covered terminology and general ideas that I hope will serve you well. Re member that most of what is discussed in these first three chapters will be applied and rein forced in the investigation of specific openings that occupies the larger portion of this book.
2 Opening Ideas and Positional
Features In this chapter we'll begin by considering some general and even philosophical issues about opening play. We'll then tum to special topics involving different types of centres and proper ties of pieces and pawns. Much of the chapter will be devoted to pawns and weaknesses, open ing the investigation of 'positional' chess and setting the stage for its more detailed discus sion in Chapter 3. Black's Goals in the Opening Chess books have traditionally said that Black's goal in the opening is to obtain equality. A pop ular variant of this is that Black must first se cure equality and only later search for chances to gain the advantage. There are certainly open ings in which that is likely to be the case, but in many openings Black also has the choice to play aggressively and endeavour to steal the ad vantage from White right away. In cases where he falls short of that goal, energetic opening play by Black may still lead to a position so complex and unclear that to speak of equality is meaningless. Sometimes we say 'dynamically balanced' instead of 'equal' to express the view that either player is as likely as the other to emerge from complications with an advantage. This style of opening play has become preva lent in modem chess, with World Champions Fischer and Kasparov as its most visible practi tioners. Both approaches to playing Black are valid, and the distinction between them contributes to the diversity of styles amongst contempo rary players. Of course, we should remember that White has always had a better percentage score than Black. But is that due to Black's ac ceptance of a small disadvantage in the course of playing directly for equality, or does it re sult from Black becoming overextended in his search for an advantage? Books from the first half of the 20th century particularly stressed the need for equalizing before all else. They often implied that the advanced, mature player would focus on neutralizing White's first-move ad vantage, whereas the impatient youngster who tried to bowl over his opponent would be pun ished by a seasoned master. This attitude may have slowly evolved out of experiences with the openings that were played in the middle of the 19th century, openings which gradually lost favour after players became more 'scientific'. Most games of that day began with I e4 e5, and the apparent failure of ambitious counterattacks by Black reinforced the philosophy of 'equal ity first'. For example, interest dropped in the more exotic King's Gambit lines such as that of the famous Andersson-Kieseritzky 'Immortal Game' : 1 e4 e5 2 f4 exf4 3 .tc4 �4+ 4 @fl b5?! (D). Also pushed to the periphery were 1 e4 e5 2 .tc4 .tc5 3 b4 .txb4 4 f4 and 1 e4 e5 2 f4 exf4 3 tt:\f3 g5 4 .tc4 g4 5 tt:lc3 (maybe not so horrid but abandoned nevertheless). Similarly, the adventurous Evans Gambit stayed around for a while, but after 1 e4 e5 2
24 MASTERING THE CHESS OPENINGS
lt:lf3 lllc6 3 .i.c4 .i.c5 4 b4 .i.xb4 5 c3 .i.a5 6 O-O the likes of 6 ... 'i!Vf6!? were largely replaced by safer defences such as Lasker' s 6 ...d6 7 d4 .i.b6. In addition, provocative openings such as the Philidor Countergambit ( 1 e4 e5 2 lllf3 d6 3 d4 f5), and the Schliemann Defence to the Ruy Lopez (1 e4 e5 2 lt:lf3 lllc6 3 .i.b5 f5) were held to be dubious or were at any rate supplanted by more careful strategies. Lastly, responses to 1 e4 which favoured confrontation over equality also failed to gain a foothold until their playa bility was established. Most masters didn't take seriously such moves as 1...lt:lf6, l ...d6 and 1 .. .g6, nor was 1.. .d5 approved of by the lead ing masters. In fact, the latter has only been convincingly revived in the last ten years. As an alternative to l ...e5, the solid Caro Kann ( l...c6) gained popularity after 1 900, pri marily as an equalizing weapon. In the same 'equality-first' vein, French Defence players employed the unambitious move ... dxe4 (e.g., 1 e4 e6 2 d4 d5 3 lllc3 dxe4), and the French De fence generally lacked the dynamic character that it later acquired. (To this day, in fact, ... dxe4 systems are chosen by leading grandmasters, often as a way to simplify the play and equal ize). When players did essay upon 1 d4 instead of 1 e4, l ...d5 was the overwhelming response by Black, with the various 'Indian' defences (beginning with I...lt:lf6) held in low esteem. Looking back, we can see that the legitimate desire to establish a pawn presence in the centre greatly influenced the choice of and attitudes towards opening play. The Sicilian Defence ( 1 e4 c5) neglects to move a centre pawn (see the next paragraph), whereas defences to 1 e4 such as 1...lllf6, l ...d6 and 1...g6 all concede the ideal or at least favourable centre to White. So do several of today's dynamic and/or unbalanc ing replies to 1 d4. For instance, the King's In dian Defence allows White to occupy the centre directly in the main lines after 1 d4 lt:lf6 2 c4 g6 3 lllc3 .i.g7 4 e4 d6 (D). Compare the related discussion at the begin ning of Chapter 3. The Sicilian Defence ( 1 e4 c5), which ac counts for nearly 20% ( !) of all top-level grand master games played today, was at first a more ambiguous case, with a curious evolution. Al though one sees only a handful of modern-style treatments in top-level games throughout the latter half of the 1 9th century and into the 20th, the Sicilian Defence grew to be played in a re spectable 5% of such encounters. At first it was White who failed to play aggressively in the centre, typically choosing the Closed Sicilian (2 lllc3) or 2 f4. As players then turned to the Open Sicilian with 2 lllf3 and 3 d4, Black tended to play active, developing moves, until the Scheveningen V aria ti on with its backward central structure ( ... e6 and ... d6) was brought to general attention in the 1920s by prominent players such as Euwe. Soon, various new inter pretations of the Open Sicilian became estab lished as main lines. But the extent to which Black could disrespect the basics of develop ment and space in favour of other factors be came apparent only much later. During the 1 940s and 1 950s new interpretations of the Si cilian Defence ushered in a modern age of dy namism; players and theoreticians developed the fundamental structures and piece-play that are used today by nearly every major player. Dynamic variations of traditional openings also gained popularity; e.g., the Winawer Variation in the French Defence and the Marshall Attack in the Ruy Lopez. The Alekhine Defence and Pirc Defence had accumulated masses of the ory and stalwart grandmaster adherents by the time Fischer used both openings in his 1 972 World Championship match versus Spassky; today these openings are played less than oth ers in high-level chess but certainly retain their legitimacy. After that lengthy digression, no one will be surprised to find that either of Black's ap proaches to the opening is valid, that is, he can play for equality or aspire to achieve a dynamic
OPENING IDEAS AND POSITIONAL FEATURES 25
imbalance. Some players just starting out, how ever, may not have heard about the latter op tion. White's Goals in the Opening White has choices similar to Black's, assuming that he has the same opportunities. White can work patiently to hold on to his inherent ad vantage, usually by suppressing his opponent's counterplay and 'accumulating small advan tages'. Or White can seek dynamic situations in which he tries to take the initiative and keep Black on his heels. Finally, White can plunge into two-sided slugfests and hope to express his theoretical advantage or superior skills in that environment. Once again all of these methods are admissible. But for White there is a differ ent twist. Curiously, it is sometimes easier for Black to launch an effective attack and to define the quality of early play than it is for White to do the same. Black has the advantage of know ing his opponent's moves ahead of time. If he chooses to play a solid game it may be impossi ble for White to attack aggressively. Of course the reverse is also true: White can play 1 d4, 2 'Llf3 and 3 .i.f4 against most openings, or, for example, 1 'Llf3, 2 g3, 3 .i.g2, 4 d3 and 5 O-O against practically anything. But most players aren't interested in giving away the advantage of the first move with such conservative moves and so will choose to play more ambitiously. Paradoxically, this can let Black set the pace in certain openings. Central Types Several very important central formations will be explored in detail in the next chapter. Among them will be centres characterized by: a) isolated pawns; b) majorities and minorities; c) restrained central pawns; and d) pawn-chains. Most other types of centre that have practical significance will be represented somewhere in the main body of the book. It's useful to look at some of those central formations to get a feel for how they can be analysed and assessed. Be aware that the material in this chapter will be gin at an elementary level but quickly move into complex areas that are not essential for the inexperienced player to master.
1. The 'vanishing centre'. As the name im
plies, all or most of the centre pawns are ex changed or captured. They leave a gap in the middle of the board through which pieces can move in a more-or-less unobstructed fashion. The vanishing centre tends to favour the side with the better development, and tactics can easily dominate the play; for example, in the Danish Gambit with 1 e4 e5 2 d4 exd4 3 c3 dxc3 4 .i.c4 cxb2 5 .i.xb2 d5 6 .i.xd5 'Llf6! 7 .i.xf7+! @xf7 8 �xd8 .i.b4+ 9 �d2 .i.xd2+ 10 'Llxd2, and the game settles down. But if devel opment is about equal and the game hasn't been reduced to disorderly skirmishing, then vulner able points and pawn weaknesses can be mag nified because they are so accessible.

This is a well-known version of the Exchange Variation of the King's Indian Defence where a series of early exchanges has decimated the centre. According to theory, Black stands slightly better. White has weaknesses on d3 and d4 that can be occupied by Black's minor pieces, whereas White can't find good squares other than f6 to exploit in Black's position. If White waits around, Black will occupy the d4- square by ... lbc6-d4, so White should move quickly and play 1 1 j,_g5 j,_xb2 12 j,_xd8! j,_xal 13 j,_xc7 lbc6 14 O-O j,_g7, when Black has only a small positional advantage.

The centre pawns have been swept away but static factors are still controlling the play. Black has the weaker pawn-structure but he also has the bishop-pair. White has a mobile majority on the kingside, which can theoreti cally be used to create a passed pawn. But that's far down the road and in the middlegame, espe cially with the vanished centre, one would ex pect that Black's two bishops would be more effective than the bishop and knight. The prob lem is that White controls more space and Black has no centre pawn with which to drive White's pieces away. The position is about equal. The vanished centre shows up in old gambit lines which were popular 1 00 or more years ago. Some of these lines have never been per manently stowed away. A case in point:

The centre has been cleared out and there's no way to make a simple assessment. Only a lot of brainpower, computer analysis and corre spondence chess can solve this sort of thing; in fact, only those things got chess researchers this far! Which brings me to another point: my aim in this book is to have you understand strat egy, including typical methods for both sides to handle attacking positions. It's often possible to indicate recurrent themes and some connec tions among them. However, I shall rarely ana lyse chaotic positions like this one featuring moment-to-moment variations in tactical events. The correct moves are so unpredictable that they really can't be 'explained' except on a case-by-case basis. You may be able to find out

more about them in books that make specific detailed investigations; better yet, you can try to work them out for yourself ! 2 . We have already seen and discussed cases of the 'ideal centre' (also known as the 'classi cal centre'), in which one side has pawns on e4 and d4 (or e5 and d5). Normally the ideal centre constitutes an advantage, but that's only true if it has some positive effect on the position; for example, tying down the opponent's pieces, ad vancing with tempo, creating a passed pawn, and/or serving as the pivot point from which pieces can launch an attack. Otherwise the op ponent might be able to attack the centre pawns from afar with little risk. In a typical situation Black restrains White's ideal centre but can't break it down. This imbalance arises in certain variations of the Queen's Gambit Accepted, Slav, Grlinfeld, and this main line of the Semi Tarrasch:
1 d4 d5 2 c4 e6 3 tt:lc3 tt:\f6 4 tt:\f3 c5 5 cxd5

3. The formation arising from what is called
the 'surrender of the centre' appears in many different openings. It involves a single white central pawn on e4 or d4 facing a lone black pawn on d6 or e6, respectively. Generally, White has somewhat the better game by virtue of his greater control of space, but Black has a compact structure and an open file aiming at White's 4th-rank pawn, so the advantage can range from tiny to moderately significant. Here's an illustration taken from the 'classi cal' Philidor's Defence:
1 e4 e5 2 tt:\f3 d6 3 d4 exd4 4 tt:lxd4 tt:lf6 5
tt:lc3 .te7 6 .tc4 O-O 7 O-O l:Ie8 8 .tf4 .trs 9 f3

White has a pleasant advantage because he controls more space and has freer development. A surrender of the centre occurs in the old main line of the Caro-Kann Defence:

28 MASTERING THE CHESS OPENINGS
the d4-based centre with the move ... c5. White has the easier game, but against accurate play he will retain little if any advantage. This type of 'restraint centre' will be discussed at some length in Chapter 3. Flank versus Centre It's always hard to assess whether a flank pawn advance in the opening is strong or weak. It's often said that a centre has to be safe in order to justify a pawn advance. That is true in many sit uations; e.g.:
1 e4 cS 2 ll'Bf3 d6 3 d4 cxd4 4 ll'Bxd4 ll'Bf6 S
ll'Bc3 g6 6 .i.e2 .i.g7 7 .i.e3 O-O 8 O-O tt:lc6 9 tt:lb3 aS 10 a4 .i.e6 11 g4 (D) This is too early an advance. The centre should be secured by 11 f4 with the idea 11 ... d5? 12 f5. 1 1. . •dS!

But the reverse is also true: flank pawn moves will frequently drive a piece away from a square on which that piece controls the centre and/or threatens to support a central advance. Another line of the Sicilian Defence is a case in point:

Black will have serious weaknesses after 14 ... O-O 15 dxe6 fxe6 16 .i.d3. In these examples, the flank de fends the centre. As long as you're aware that each situation has to be assessed on its own merits, you should always consider responding to a flank attack with a central counterattack, and vice-versa. But neither response should be made into a rule. Weaknesses The word 'weakness' refers to problems with pawns and pawn-structures. Some terms relat ing to pawns still need to be defined, which we'll do presently. First, however, I want to make a broader comment. Pawn weaknesses are to be avoided at any stage of the game if you get nothing in return for them, and understand ing pawn-structures (a subject much wider than
OPENING IDEAS AND POSITIONAL FEATURES 29
pawn weaknesses) is more important than any other factor in understanding chess. But that in sight should not be confused with a general phobia towards weaknesses. Generally they are not as important in the opening as they are later in the game. Tarrasch' s dictum 'Before the endgame the gods have placed the middlegame' is part of the explanation, yet it is not the whole story here. As the middlegame progresses and considerable simplification has occurred (or is imminent), a player must be particularly con cerned with current weaknesses, and eventu ally with what an endgame might bring if that pawn-structure persists. Sometimes this calls for radical action. But in the opening stage (partic ularly within the first 10 moves or so) structural weaknesses are generally more of an immedi ate defensive problem than one which must be attended to for the sake of the ending. They can be incorporated into an overall approach to a position that works extremely well; e.g., a terri bly weak pawn may temporarily provide pro tection from the opponent's play and allow you to gain the advantage. That holds true because of the ever-changing nature of most openings and middlegames. Especially players who are beginning to gain experience with chess should not overestimate the drawbacks of weaknesses such as doubled, isolated or backward pawns and thus ignore good opportunities for attack or other positive activity. I find that students gen erally err on the side of caution in this respect, when they could aggressively pursue the initia tive. So yes, try to avoid unnecessary weak nesses and take advantage of those in your opponent' s position, but don't make decisions that are too focused on just this one aspect of the game. Y our pawn-structure may be telling you other important things about how to handle the position as a whole. There follow some definitions and short ex planations of pawn types and properties. In Chapter 3 we investigate and evaluate these in much greater detail.
1. An isolated pawn is one that has no
pawns of its own colour (i.e. friendly pawns) on any adjacent file. In practice, we are especially concerned with such a pawn when it's on an open file. In Chapter 3 you will find a lengthy discussion and many examples of isolated pawns. In some very typical situations, their advantages are famously in balance with their disadvantages, which is why so many players rush to take them on and others to play against them. White has three isolated pawns, on a4, c3 and e3. Black has one isolated pawn on b7. The pawns on a4, c3 and b7 are on open files and thus relatively more exposed than the pawn on e3, which is masked by an opposing pawn on the same file.
2. A backward pawn is one that has at least
one pawn of its own colour on an adjacent file, but that neighbouring pawn is situated one rank or further ahead of its compatriot. In this well-known position from the Sicilian Defence, Black's d6-pawn is a backward pawn. Often the square in front of the backward pawn serves as an outpost for the opponent, as it does
30 MASTERING THE CHESS OPENINGS
here (see Chapter 1 for a description of the out post). We care most about backward pawns on open file, as is Black's on d6. Backward pawns are usually weak, but not always so.
3. A doubled pawn is one that resides on
the same file as another of your pawns. As usual, doubled pawns on an open file are weaker than those that are masked by enemy pawns. Doubled pawns can be weak or strong, but most of the time isolated doubled pawns on an open file are a serious disadvantage, both because they are hard to defend and be cause there is a wonderful outpost in front of the pawns, just asking for an opposing piece to occupy it. Here is a well-known situation in which a knight is stationed in front of doubled f-pawns.
4. Pawns that block the path of pieces are
always a problem, and the most famous of such problems involve 'good' and 'bad' bishops. I'll be using those terms throughout the analysis section, so I should attempt a definition. A 'bad' bishop is one whose central pawns are on the same-coloured squares as the bishop; con versely a 'good' bishop lives on the squares that are of the colour opposite to its central pawns. Notice the emphasis on central pawns. By far the most important pawns in determining the 'goodness' or 'badness' of a bishop are the d and e- pawns. Adjacent c- and f-pawns can be factored in if they seem relevant to the bishop's overall mobility, but these pawns must be given considerably less weight. Let's look at this situ ation in the abstract: Assessing Black's bishops is the easiest task. Black's pawns on e6 and d5 are on light squares, so his bishop on d7 is 'bad' and the one on e7 is 'good'. It happens that all of Black's other pawns are on light squares as well, but except for the c- and f-pawns, which are of limited im portance, they aren't factors in the way we as sess whether a bishop is good or bad. White's light-squared bishop may look use less because it is blocked by pawns on f3, h3 and g3, while even those pawns on c2, c3 and a4 might provide obstacles. But it is a 'good' bishop because White's centre pawns are on dark squares. By contrast, the a5-bishop has two nice open diagonals and can even reach the wonderful outpost on e5. Nevertheless, it is a 'bad' bishop because it is on the same colour as the central pawns. The point is that a 'good' bishop can be a poor or even dysfunctional piece whereas a 'bad' bishop may be the best piece on the board. However, those situations are exceptional. In a considerable majority of cases a 'good' bishop really is the one that serves you the best (and that you don't want to exchange!), while a 'bad' bishop tends to be ob structed and passive. This generalization goes back to the extraordinary importance of the centre. Bad bishops can serve as decent defenders but they can be particularly unhelpful when op posed by a good knight (see following dia gram):

In a fairly conventional Sicilian position, Black plays the standard ... d5 break, thinking to free his pieces. But he may not have considered the full consequences of a general liquidation.

The word 'prophy laxis' in chess has to do with the prevention of an opponent's plans and desired-for continua tions, the latter including freeing moves and moves that serve a productive purpose, whether defensive or aggressive in nature. Although the concept of prophylaxis can also embrace a wider set of meanings, those are the relevant ones for most discussions about openings. Fianchettoed bishops, for instance, can be bad and still serve prophylactic purposes. By way of illustration, one might wonder why Black spends two moves to fianchetto his bishop in the King's Indian Defence and then plays ...e5 to block it off! And why does Black in that defence often go to lengths to avoid ex changing that bishop? Shouldn't it be consid ered the epitome of a poorly-placed bishop? To the contrary, King's Indian fans tend to think of that piece as their most precious pos session. Let's see a simplified example:

If one's analysis were based solely upon attacking Black's centre, one might play the weak move 11 f4?, leading to 1 l...exf4 12 ii.xf4 tt::l e5, but then the g7-bishop is not only a powerful piece but supports the outpost on e5 in front of White's backward pawn. So one can say that the g7-bishop 'pre vents' 11 f4 (and the idea of f4 generally). Or, in
32 MASTERING THE CHESS OPENINGS
a sequence such as 11 tbd3 f5 12 tbxc5 tbxc5, White shouldn't play 13 exf5? !. He might do this for the sake of avoiding Black's dangerous attack that follows from 13 f3 f4. But 13 exf5? ! i..xf5 14 'iVdl runs up against 14 ...e4!, when the g7-bishop has gone from a passive onlooker to a major force. In this and similar positions, the dark-squared bishop serves as a prophylac tic measure versus White's exf5, which might otherwise hamper Black's plans. I should add that in some cases where Black replies to exf5 with ... gxf5, that will also allow him to play a favourable ...e4 and free his bad bishop. What's the lesson? That a bad bishop can discourage moves that would otherwise hurt his cause. It doesn't take a fianchettoed bishop to fill that role, of course. In the Closed Ruy Lopez when White constructs a pawn-structure with e4 and d5 and places his bishop on c2, one might say that White's bad bishop on c2 has a natural prophylactic effect against the move .. .f5, because then exf5 brings the bishop into a kingside attack. If Black has a pawn on c7 (with the same piece placement), then the move ... c6 can be answered by dxc6 and i.. b3, taking over the open a2-g8 diagonal. For these ideas see, for example, the Breyer Defence or Zaitsev Variation in the Ruy Lopez (Chapter 8). Colour Complexes In a great number of openings, one player or both will concentrate his forces either largely or exclusively on squares of one colour or the other. This is particularly logical in Black's case because he doesn't have time to keep up with White on both colour squares. One case in point is the Nimzo-Indian Defence, in which the first three moves all control light squares (1 d4 tbf6 2 c4 e6 3 tbc3 i..b4), and several main lines continue with ... b6, ... i..b7 and ... tbe4 (strictly speaking this last move aims at dark squares, although it 'plays on' light squares and prepares another light-square move, ...f5). In doubled-pawn variations such as 4 a3 i..xc3+ 5 bxc3, we might see Black play ... b6, ... i..a6, ... tbc6-a5 and ... d5, which is truly playing on a colour complex. The following game combines complementary themes of backward pawns, outposts, and playing on a colour complex. Taimanov - Karpov Moscow teams 1973

would put a very bad bishop on c3 whose po tential to be freed by the move d5 is almost non-existent, especially after Black places a knight on the truly powerful outpost on d5. The c3-pawn can be either weak or strong, the latter depending upon two possibilities: a) the c3-pawn does such a good job of sup porting d4 that it allows White the time to orga nize a kingside or central attack; b) the pawn can advance to c4. Taimanov wants to pursue the latter idea, counting upon the superiority of his bishop over Black's d7-knight (which incidentally doesn't have many prospects right now be cause it is restricted by White's d4-pawn). A favourable change of structure might come about, for instance, if White can play c4 fol lowed by .llb4. The problem is that Black strikes first.

'iif4+ 41 @h l exd5 42 'ii e3 'iif5. This game is typical in that the structure re sulting from the opening is indicative of whether players will be concentrating upon a certain colour throughout the game. There are quite a few other openings with a lasting orientation towards playing on one col our. Consider the main lines of the Dragon Variation of the Sicilian: Black's central pawns are situated to control dark squares, and his most active pieces control dark squares: the all important g7-bishop, the c6-knight, his queen on a5 or c7 (more often than not), and even the c8-rook has its greedy eye on c3. Black's f6- knight has a tendency to go to d7 and augment control of the dark squares e5 and c5. Only the queen's bishop doesn't participate, but it has in herent difficulties in that respect. White nor mally castles queenside, when Black's most devastating attacks seem to land on the squares c3 and b2. Nevertheless, when I speak of a position in which 'Black dominates the dark squares', there's usually a persistence of structural weak ness that I'm referring to. For instance: Domination of a colour complex doesn't nec essarily mean a winning position but it probably constitutes a serious advantage, often compen sation or more for the exchange, which was sac rificed in this example by capturing a knight on f3. White still has his dark-squared bishop, but he has lost the dark squares anyway. Internal Weaknesses An important situation arises when one or both sides have 'internal weaknesses'. This means that they have unoccupied squares on their third or fourth ranks that cannot be de fended by other pawns. Often these weak nesses are somewhat masked by a pawn-front, but they can also be exposed when a pawn front disappears or breaks down. Generally, I'll refer to internal weaknesses in the centre of the board, i.e. White's squares e4, d4, e3 and d3, or Black's on e5, d5, e6 and d6. Weak nesses on the flank squares are normally of less note, but those created by a pawn advance in front of one's king are a huge exception; for instance, an attack by f4-f5, g4-g5 and h4 can create critical weaknesses on f4, g4, h4, f3, g3 and h3. Players tend to be very careful about exposing their kings in such a fashion. In my experience, less advanced players fail to rec ognize this type of weakness, especially if the squares in question are not immediately at tacked or occupied.
OPENING IDEAS AND POSITIONAL FEATURES 35
A typical example of a complex of internal weaknesses arises with an advanced centre. In the last chapter we saw a King's Indian Four Pawns Attack in which the front of the centre collapsed and the internal weaknesses were ex posed. It's worth taking the time to look back at that example, especially the final diagram. The weaknesses remain regardless of whether the pawns that mask them disappear.

3 The Significance of Structure
A Simple Question: Pawns or Pieces? An inexperienced player, having struggled with a number of opening sequences, might legiti mately ask: "Is it more important at the begin ning of a game to establish my position with numerous pawn moves, or should I be develop ing my pieces as quickly as possible?" This question is not so easily answered, perhaps not even by those more familiar with the game. In chess history, new openings that don't stake a claim to the centre have been regarded with suspicion, and one of the first reactions is to refute such openings with the construction of a large centre, soon to be followed by its ad vance. Thus the Alekhine Defence was chal lenged by 1 e4 lbf6 2 e5 lbd5 3 c4 lbb6 4 d4 d6 5 f4, and the King's Indian Defence by 1 d4 lLif6 2 c4 g6 3 lbc3 �g7 4 e4 d6 5 f4 (D), each called 'the Four Pawns Attack' in their particu lar opening.

The Modern Benoni faced the pawn on slaught 1 d4 lLif6 2 c4 c5 3 d5 e6 4 lbc3 exd5 5 cxd5 d6 6 e4 g6 7 f4 �g7 8 e5. In the early days of the Pirc Defence, theory and practice con centrated primarily upon the Austrian Attack, i.e. 1 e4 d6 2 d4 lbf6 3 lbc3 g6 4 f4 (D), often with an early e5. The related Modern Defence, 1 e4 g6 2 d4 .i.g7, was similarly met by 3 lbc3 d6 4 f4 or 3 c3 d6 4 f4. Even in a uniquely positional open ing such as the Benko Gambit, 1 d4 lbf6 2 c4 c5
3 d5 b5 4 cxb5 a6 you'll find quite a few early
games with bxa6 followed by f4 and e4 with the idea of e5. Likewise, when the English Defence began to gain notice, attention was focused on broad-pawn-front variations such as 1 c4 b6 2 d4 e6 3 e4 and 1 c4 b6 2 d4 �b7 3 lbc3 e6 4 e4. Recently the opening 1 d4 lbf6 2 c4 lbc6 (the 'Knights' Tango') has become respectable, but it first had to be shown that the uninhibited ad vance 3 d5 lbe5 4 e4 e6 5 f4 was not a threat to the entire system. Returning to more conven tional openings, it's easy to forget how often early games with the Nimzo-Indian featured 1 d4 lbf6 2 c4 e6 3 lbc3 .i.b4 4 a3 �xc3+ 5 bxc3 followed by a set-up with e4 (e.g., 5 ... O-O 6 f3 c5 7 e4 with �d3, lbe2 and f4 to follow, estab lishing a broad central front). Most of the varia tions listed above are not bad, and some remain effective weapons to this day, but none are refu tations of the openings concerned. After these impetuous attempts, attention usually turned to a less ostentatious centre and quicker development. In the examples above, we might find White playing, respectively, 1 e4 lLif6 2 e5 lbd5 3 d4 d6 4 lbf3 (versus the
THE SIGNIFICANCE OF STRUCTURE 3 7
Alekhine Defence) or 1 d4 lLif6 2 c4 g6 3 l2Jc3 (or 3 lLif3 .i.g7 4 g3) 3 ... .i.g7 4 e4 d6 5 lLif3 (
D)
(versus the King's Indian Defence). There are also 1 d4 lLif6 2 c4 c5 3 d5 e6 4 l2Jc3 exd5 5 cxd5 d6 6 e4 g6 7 lLif3 (versus the Benoni) and 1 e4 d6 2 d4 l2Jf6 3 lLic3 g6 4 lLif3 (D) (versus the Pirc Defence). Today we see the more modest 1 d4 l2Jf6 2 c4 c5 3 d5 b5 4 cxb5 (4 lLif3) 4. .. a6 5 bxa6 and l2Jf3 followed by l2Jc3 and g3 (versus the Benko Gambit); 1 c4 b6 2 d4 e6 3 l2Jc3 .i.b7 4 a3 or 4 lLif3 (versus the English Defence); 1 d4 l2Jf6 2 c4 l2Jc6 3 lLif3 e6 4 l2Jc3 (versus the Knights' Tango); and 1 d4 lLif6 2 c4 e6 3 l2Jc3 .i.b4 4 'iVc2 (versus the Nimzo-Indian Defence). Of course these are just a few examples, and many other main-line pawn-structures support fast piece development. In these variations the pieces and pawns seem to be in mutual support and one might easily conclude that this is the ideal situation. But the distinction between a philosophy of 'pawns-before-pieces' and one assigning equal priority to both has become increasingly more subtle and context-dependent as time has gone by. I already mentioned in Chapter 2 that when the Open variations of the Sicilian were estab lishing themselves in the first part of the 20th century, there was a tendency on Black's part to get his pieces out reasonably quickly. For in stance, you would see 1 e4 c5 2 lLif3 lLic6 3 d4 cxd4 4 lLixd4 lLif6 5 l2Jc3 e6 and ... .i.b4 and/or the freeing move ... d5 with rapid development. Systems such as the Dragon Variation became relatively popular; for example, 1 e4 c5 2 lLif3 d6 3 d4 cxd4 4 l2Jxd4 l2Jf6 5 l2Jc3 g6 6 .ll e2 .i.g7
7 O-O O-O 8 .i.e3 lLic6 (D).
In that case four of Black's pieces are devel oped within the first eight moves. We then often see Black make several more piece moves before touching another pawn (e.g., ... l2Jxd4, ... .\le6, .. .l:Ic8); this policy is clearly indicated by the ini tial pawn-structure. In contemporary play, how ever, we regularly see variations of the Sicilian Defence in which the establishment of pawn structure swamps rapid development, not least of which is the most popular Sicilian system of them all, the Najdorf Variation: 1 e4 c5 2 lLif3 d6
3 d4 cxd4 4 lLixd4 lLif6 5 l2Jc3 a6 to be followed
by more pawn moves such as ... e6 and ... b5. Even in the list of 'balanced' variations that I gave two paragraphs back, things will shift dra matically in one direction or another while still in the opening stage. In the King's Indian exam ple, everything follows the harmonious model in the main line 1 d4 l2Jf6 2 c4 g6 3 l2Jc3 .\lg7 4 e4 d6 5 lLif3 O-O 6 .ll e2 e5 7 O-O lLic6 8 d5 lLie 7 (D).
38 MASTERING THE CHESS OPENINGS
w All well and fine, with a nice balance be tween piece moves and pawn advances. But in this position Black will customarily embark upon a massive pawn advance that, in its deter mined neglect of piece development, would put a Four Pawns attacker to shame. As you may know, Black plays ... lbd7 first, and then that ad vance typically consists of ... f5-f4, ... h5 and ... g5-g4 and is frequently accompanied by un developing moves such as ... �f8 and ... lbg8. In a large number of lines, Black's a8-rook and c8- bishop will remain in their places until moves 20 to 25 or even longer. So the initial moves of an opening are not always indicative of its bal ance between pawn moves and development. Naturally there are times in which early piece development and related events will dictate what structure becomes appropriate, but not of ten. Furthermore, pawn-structures have primacy in terms of the weaknesses they create, which determine both where the opponent can attack and what squares he can usefully occupy. For crucial periods of time, pawns block the devel opment of pieces, or open lines for them. Whether freeing moves are even available to activate passive pieces is largely dependent upon pawn-structure. Pieces have only second ary roles in these areas of consuming interest for the player. So the obvious answer to the query in the first paragraph, namely, that 'you should both advance pawns and develop at the same time, in a mutually supportive manner' , is simplistic and wanting in content. What's more impor tant, such a statement doesn't serve as helpful advice for most players. I think that the question should be reframed: which takes precedence in any given position, pawn-structure or piece development? How should we organize our thoughts so as to optimize our understanding? In the examples of openings above, and in the vast majority of opening variations in this book, the pawn-structure is in fact the determinant of appropriate piece placement and not the other way around. The structure sets the overall pa rameters of development, such that there may be many ways to bring the pieces out but their effectiveness (or lack thereof) depends upon pawn configuration. That relationship is true whether or not you throw all of your pawns for ward to begin the game, or only a couple of them; thus it lends itself to a more useful view of opening play. Relevant questions now emerge: is my centre breaking down before I can com plete the development with which it was sup posed to assist? Am I creating weaknesses and targets of attack for my opponent? Is there any way, given the pawn-structure before me (or the one I am about to construct) that I can ar range all my pieces on useful squares where they don't interfere with each other? Given that my pieces won't be able to reach their desirable squares in time, can I change the structure so as to make their deployment timely and useful? In other words, the pawns usually determine the harmony or lack thereof in your potential piece configurations. In addition, there is the crucial relationship between pawn-structure, which we tend to think of in static terms, and dynamics. In a sense every attack depends upon the structure the attacker inherits, but that is not a very useful disclosure. What counts is whether we can associate iden tifiable dynamic elements with known struc tures. The result may be compared with happily recognizing an old friend (resulting in a combi nation or tactic that one can easily assess), or running into vaguely familiar but enigmatic companions (when combinative success may depend upon intuition). Ultimately, of course, the most brilliant and original attacks (and de fensive miracles) have their own capricious character that can't be anticipated from previ ous knowledge. In fact, the most awe-inspiring combinations are precisely those that 'shouldn't' work within a particular structural context, and 'shouldn't' work given the pieces and pawns

available for action. Nevertheless, the majority of attacks will be informed by describable cate gories of positions. Thus the precedence of pawn-structure, and the motivation for this chapter. It is generally agreed now that pattern recognition and the ability to process patterns in context is the foremost determinant in chess strength (put ting aside competitive factors). The number of patterns one can recognize and associate with other structures correlates to how well one un derstands and plays the game. Grandmasters store and process many more pawn-structures with accompanying piece placements than the average player does, if only because of their repeated exposure to them in preparation and over the board. With study alone it's possible for one to master a great number of standard opening positions in the same way, and to un derstand their interaction with the subsequent play. Appreciation of why a strategy works in one position but not in a similar position is an indispensable part of chess mastery. Further more, if you recognize ideas and manoeuvres from other openings that apply to the one that you are playing, it will help you to focus on the issues and inspire you to make better deci sions. How might we improve our knowledge of pawn-structures? Obviously it's not possible to list them all and memorize their unique fea tures. But there are formations and related is sues that repeat themselves from opening to opening, very often constituting the basis for the fundamental strategy of each. In this chap ter I'll examine some pawn-structures and the issues associated with them, choosing selected areas most likely to impact one's understand ing of the game, or at least to grasp the com mon elements of the opening. These are not strange or irregular formations; one idea is to show how one might use the same approach to study other, more complex, structures. Hope fully their usefulness will extend to players of a wide range of skills. This is not a middle game book, however, and my main goal has been to make the discussion in the forthcom ing openings section more readily comprehen sible. When presenting individual variations and games, I'll often assume your familiarity with this chapter. Isolated Pawns We saw some broad characterizations of posi tional features in the last chapter. Now I want to look at the structural elements across the board that bear upon the opening stage. We'll begin with the fairly straightforward case of the iso lated pawn, also called the 'isolani', which we defined in the Chapter 2. Textbooks almost al ways concentrate upon the isolated d-pawn, also called the 'isolated queen's pawn' (abbre viated as 'IQP'). Most authors do so to the ex clusion of isolated pawns anywhere else on the board, writing chapters and even whole books on this specific case. Granted, it's very impor tant to give the IQP its due because it can arise from so many openings, and so early in the game. Why is that? To generate an IQP in the opening, it's generally necessary to have the moves d4 and ... d5 appear early on, and it's ex tremely likely that one or both of the moves c4 or ... c5 were also played in the first stage of the opening. To show this, let's take a list of several openings that lead to the same, well-known type of isolated queen's pawn position, and sometimes to the very same position: Queen's Gambit Accepted: 1 d4 d5 2 c4 dxc4 3 CLJf3 CLJf6 4 e3 e6 5 .llxc4 c5 6 O-O cxd4 7 exd4 .ll e7 8 CLJc3 O-O 9 .l:!.el .

This is the basic picture (see diagram over leaf): The most significant difference among these openings is the position of White's light-squared bishop (it's on c4 or d3). Sometimes the queen is already placed upon c2 or e2, and the king's
40 MASTERING THE CHESS OPENINGS
rook is usually but not always moved to e l . The basic position and its variants have been played thousands of times and investigated in depth. In fact, more words have been written about the IQP than about any other specific positional feature in chess. Neither side can be said to stand inherently better, which is why both sides are willing to enter into these positions. With out going into detail, here are the basic struc tural properties and strategies that should be stressed. For ease of discussion, let's assume that White is the possessor of the IQP before we attend to specific examples. Disadvantages of the isolated d-pawn:
1. The IQP is a relatively easier target than
most pawns because it can only be protected by pieces, several of which may be required for the task (as opposed to needing only a sin gle pawn). Also, the d-pawn is almost always on an open file potentially facing Black's rooks and/or queen.
2. Defence of the isolated d-pawn can tie
down White's pieces which might be used more effectively elsewhere.
3. Black gains an influential outpost in front
of the isolani, which means that it is very diffi cult to drive his pieces off that spot.
4. The IQP tends to be a more serious weak
ness in simplified positions, the more so in an endgame. Notice that the mutual possession of the open c-file increases the chances of simpli fication. Nevertheless, Black must be skilful to make the right kind of simplification that doesn't come with other disadvantages. Often a new equilibrium will result from exchanges. Advantages of the isolated d-pawn:
1. White will be able to develop more easily
and aggressively, having more space and open lines for his bishops.
2. The IQP creates a support-point for a
knight (or other piece) on e5.
3. The threat of the d-pawn's advance ties
Black's pieces to the defence of d5.
4. Black, with less space, will have difficulty
developing actively without making some con cession such as creating a weakness or ceding the bishop-pair.
5. White has good kingside attacking chances
based upon the support-point on e5, the e-file, and his bishops aimed in that direction. In terms of strategy, White will have several ways of proceeding. He will usually complete his development by putting his queen on e2 or d3 (less frequently c2 or b3) and queen's rook on d l . Then one of the first goals is to provoke a weakness on the kingside. To do this, he can play lbe5 and swing a rook to the kingside via e3. Or he can line up his bishop and queen to create a threat on h7. Black will generally de fend by keeping a knight on f6 and playing ...g6 if necessary. With that set-up White can attack the dark squares by i..h6, work to soften up the kingside by h4-h5 and/or play for d5, often by bringing his bishop back to the a2-g8 diagonal. The safe advance of the d-pawn to d5 beto kens success in most cases because it opens lines or broadens potential uses for almost all of his pieces (notably, the rooks on d l and e l , bishop on a2 and knight on c3) and breaks down the defender at e6; it also liquidates the isolani itself. After d5 White usually has the far superior pieces, and he often has tactical re sources that win material. The d5 break is prob ably the most frequently successful plan. There are also set-ups with the moves l:.el -e3-g3; or, more commonly, lbe5, ..llc4 and J:.el , intending tactics such as lbxf7, particularly if Black's rook is on e8. These ideas and others only work because White's superiority in space permits him to transfer his pieces rapidly, make threats, and take Black out of his game plan. The more pieces with which to attack, the better. Black's strategy is not excessively compli cated, although implementing it may be. His
THE SIGNIFICANCE OF STRUCTURE 41
first goal is to maintain the blockade on d5, usu ally with a knight. Simply leaving a knight there is often not enough, however, because White may be able to capture the piece at a point where ... exd5 is forced, eliminating the threat to d4 and sometimes transforming the pawn structure in White' s favour. Thus, whether oc cupied or not, d5 itself needs to be reinforced. Often Black's knights will go to f6 and d5 (via ... tt::l b4-d5) or to d5 and e7. His c8-bishop will be developed to b7, either by ... b6 or by ... a6 and ... b5. A rook on d8 can also act to support a piece on d5 or restrain White' s pawn advance to d5. One of Black's goals is simplification: the more pieces that are exchanged the less likely it is that White can break through. More over, the closer that Black can get to an endgame the better his prospects usually are. Exchanging White's minor pieces is a high priority, because they can have considerable range from squares around the isolated pawn. Knights in particu lar are dangerous when posted on e4, e5 and c5; and even seemingly 'defensive' knights on c3 and f3 can quickly come into action. Ex changing White' s light-squared bishop is a real coup for Black; whether on c4, d3, a2 or c2, it is the piece most likely to be involved in a direct attack. By contrast, a rook on d l defending the isolani is much less likely to do any damage. For all that, simplification can be double edged because sometimes it clarifies White's attacking themes, especially if he has support points along open files in conjunction with pawn advances. A wonderful illustration of this is seen in Chapter 5 on the Giuoco Piano (in the main line with 1 0. .. tt::l ce7). All that is rather abstract, so here are some examples of strategy by both sides. There are literally thousands of isolated-pawn positions in games between masters, many of which can be found in books on the opening or middle game. As indicated, these positions will be taken from openings in which an IQP situation is nor mally created (for instance, in the same open ings listed above). What you will eventually find is that isolated pawns are formed in a wide range of positions, many of them appearing af ter the opening stage because of an exchange on d4 or d5. Here is a brief lesson about the main danger posed by the d-pawn: its advance. Spassky - Avtonomov Leningrad 1949

This is our first example of what is a recur ring type of position in the openings world. Black takes on an isolated c-pawn at the same time as White has an isolated d-pawn. In the general case, the obvious difference between the d-pawn and c-pawn is that White has more space; not so obvious is that a third-rank pawn is easier to defend than a fourth-rank pawn! In this instance the pawn on c6 prevents White' s isolated pawn from advancing while maintain ing an outpost on d5 and the options of ...�d6, ...�d8 and ... lll f5. Black also has a useful b-file that is typical of this structure. A lot comes down to activity here; for instance, will a white rook on the outpost c5, with the possible help of a bishop on a4, make up for Black' s pressure on the d-pawn? Probably not, but those are the kinds of competing factors that arise. More on the isolated c-pawn will follow in the examples below. Incidentally, after 19 �xc6, 19 ... lll xc6 20 d5 exd5 21 J..xd5 is at best equal for Black, be cause bishop versus knight with pawns on both sides of the board is usually difficult for the side with the knight. 19 ..• �d6 20 g3 �d8 21 �dl l:tb6!

In fact, every d-pawn opening above has some kind of reversed case, but particularly the Semi-Tarrasch, which can arise from a number of openings; e.g., 1 c4 lll f6 2 lllc3 c5 3 lllf3 e6 4 e3 d5 5 cxd5 exd5 6 d4 lll c6 7 .lte2 i.e7 8 dxc5 .ltxc5 9 O-O O-O, or 1 d4 d5 2 lllf3 lllf6 3 c4 e6 4 lll c3 c5 5 e3 lllc6 6 cxd5 exd5 7 .ltb5 .ltd6 8 dxc5 .ltxc5 9 O-O a6 1 0 .lte2 O-O and s o forth. But we also have instances of IQPs on Black's side of the board that look somewhat different: French Defence: 1 e4 e6 2 d4 d5 3 lll d2 c5 4 exd5 exd5 5 lllgf3 (or 5 .ltb5+ .ltd7 6 i.xd7+ lll xd7 7 lll gf3 lllgf6 8 O-O .lte7 9 dxc5 lll xc5) 5 ... lll c6 6 .ltb5 .ltd6 7 dxc5 .ltxc5 8 O-O llle7 9 lll b3 .ltd6 (D). Tarrasch Queen's Gambit: 1 d4 d5 2 c4 e6 3 lllc3 c5 4 cxd5 exd5 5 lll f3 lllc6 6 g3 ( 6 e3 lllf6 7 i.e2 cxd4 8 lllxd4 would be analogous to our examples from the white side) 6 ... lllf6 7 .ltg2 .lte7 8 O-O O-O 9 .ltg5 cxd4 10 lllxd4 (D). Roughly the same ideas apply to handling these openings: White should maintain close control of d4 and seek carefelly-chosen ex - changes. As mentioned above, he may be better off exchanging minor pieces than rooks, be cause rooks tend to be passive pieces as defend ers. The side with the isolani should follow the
46 MASTERING THE CHESS OPENINGS
reverse approach, exchanging rooks (if any thing has to be exchanged) and keeping minor pieces on the board. That's getting into the realm of middlegame theory, however. At any rate, activity is at a premium: rooks on open files, bishops attacking weak points, etc. And of course if you can safely get ...d4 in, your odds of a happy conclusion increase. Isolated e-Pawns The IQP isn't the only isolated pawn of interest in chess openings. First, we might ask why we don't see more isolated e-pawns in the opening. That's fairly easy: at some point an f-pawn would have to advance and that's not part of most openings, especially since there would have to be another central capture at some point. However, in the Sicilian Defence we do see a situation that is rare in other openings, i.e. the pawn-structure often leads to isolated e- and d pawns on adjacent files. There are a great num ber of lines like 1 e4 c5 2 tllf3 d6 3 d4 cxd4 4 ctJxd4 ctJf6 5 tllc3 a6 6 i.e2 e5 7 ctJb3 i.e7 8 O-O O-O 9 @h1 ctJbd7 1 0 i.e3 "V/i/c7 1 1 f4 exf4 1 2 i.xf4 (D) involving the routine moves . . .e5, f4 and ...exf4.
B
Sometimes Black has his pawn on e6 and the advance f4-f5 can lead to the same struc ture, that is, if White responds to . . .exf5 by capturing with a piece (usually a knight, i.e. tllxf5), or Black does the same after White's fxe6 (for instance, by ... i.xe6). The character istics of those positions are fairly consistent and will be discussed in Chapter 1 I on the Si cilian Defence. Isolated c-Pawns Isolated c-pawns are very common and we shall see them frequently throughout this book. They may arise a little later in the game than in the standard isolated d-pawn openings, partly because they can easily stem from them. The Sicilian Defence offers some examples: Sicilian Defence, Alapin Variation: I e4 c5 2 c3 ctJf6 3 e5 ctJd5 4 d4 cxd4 5 cxd4 d6 6 ctJf3 tll c6 7 i.c4 ctJb6 8 i.b5 dxe5 9 tllxe5 i.d7 1 0 i.xc6 i.xc6 1 I tllxc6 bxc6 (D).

Isolated c-pawns are often created in the middlegame. For the most part we won't see that in this book, but the same concepts apply. Isolated a-Pawns Few isolated b-pawns arise in the opening, but isolated a-pawns are quite common, because their creation requires only that a b-pawn cap tures towards the centre. One recurrent situa tion arises in a number of openings when White plays a4-a5 against Black's pawns on a6 and b7. This is a 'one pawn holds two' situation in the sense that if Black plays ...b5 (or sometimes ... b6), then White captures en passant and iso lates Black' s a-pawn. This type of situation occurs repeatedly in the King's Indian Defence and Benoni, for example, but watch for it in other openings. In many cases White's c-pawn will be on c4 or off the board, so his b-pawn will be isolated or backward. In the Sicilian Defence, the same capture happens but White's b-pawn is in better shape, at least theoretically, because it has the c-pawn in its vicinity. A different way for 'b-pawn ver sus a-pawn' to arise is in a position with a white pawn on a3. Black plays ...b5-b4, the b-pawn is captured by the a-pawn, and a piece recaptures on b4. Then Black's a-pawn is left isolated, and often White's b-pawn as well. This can occur in the Sicilian Defence, French Defence, King's Indian Defence, or other openings featuring a minority attack. Finally, it sometimes happens that with Black's pawn on b5 and White's on a4, Black will play simply ...bxa4, a common idea in the Ruy Lopez and Sicilian Defence (likewise with Black's pawn on b4 capturing White's on a3). Because of their distance from the centre of action, isolated and even doubled a-pawns are seldom worthwhile targets in the opening. Their vulnerability shows itself more in the endgame. Certain structures lend themselves to a-pawn raids; e.g., ... �a5(+) and ... �xa2 in the Ex change Gri.infeld Defence and certain Queen's Gambit Exchange Variations; or, for instance, when Black goes out of his way to capture White's a4-pawn in the Winawer Variation. But usually isolated a-pawns situated on the first two ranks (such as a black pawn on a6 in several openings) tend to be defensible until the middlegame is in full swing. For example, sometimes White captures a knight on a6 with his light-squared bishop and the same issues arise; for example, 1 d4 d5 2 c4 c6 3 lllf3 lll f6 4 lll c3 dxc4 5 a4 llla6 6 e4 i.g4 7 .ltxc4 e6 8 .ltxa6 bxa6 9 �d3 i.xf3 1 0 gxf3 (now we have two sets of doubled pawns; Black's are weaker, of course, but he is compensated by the b-file and a potentially safer kingside) 10 ...a5 1 1 �c4 �c8 1 2 .l:.gl �b8 1 3 .l:.g5 �b4 14 �e2 .l:.xd4 1 5 �xa5 �c7 1 6 i.e3 �xa5 1 7 .ltxd4 with ap proximate equality, Korchnoi-Conquest, Buda pest 1 996. The treatment of all these phenomena varies so much from position to position that we'll have to discuss them in context. Pawn-Chains When authors give examples of pawn-chains they tend to be pawns adjacent to and facing
48 MASTERING THE CHESS OPENINGS
another pawn-chain, i.e. interlocking. The text book example is the French Defence Advance Variation, 1 e4 e6 2 d4 d5 3 e5 c5 4 ctJf3 tllc6 5 c3. The line of pawns from b2 to e5 is called a 'chain' , and the directly interlocking pawns are on e6 and d5, but of course Black' s pawn on f7 holds up the ones on e6 and d5. Most books on strategy discuss this French Advance Variation when they want an example of pawn-chains, and also the main lines of the King' s Indian De fence. Those are excellent starting-points. We don't always think in terms of pawn-chains even if they share classical properties, for in stance, in the Slav with 1 d4 d5 2 c4 c6 3 ctJf3 ctJf6 4 e3 a6 5 c5, in which White' s pawn-chain is lengthy indeed. But in fact ...e5 is the natural way to attack that chain, and of late we've even seen the arduous b4, a4 and b5 by White to at tack the base of Black's pawn-chain at c6 (this has occurred a bit more often in the line that goes 4 tllc3 a6 5 c5 followed by i.f4, but that' s another matter). Furthermore, much of what relates to those pawn-chains is relevant to a great number of other 'pawn strings' that aren't fully or di rectly opposed by other pawns. In accordance with some other sources, I'll call these pawn chains as well. For example, if you look at the Modem Benoni ( 1 d4 ctJf6 2 c4 c5 3 d5 e6 4 tllc3 exd5 5 cxd5 d6 6 e4, especially with 6 . . .g6 7 f3) you see short 'pawn duos' pointing in opposite directions. In several openings only partially overlapping chains emerge but have chain-like properties; for example, things like c3/d4/e5 versus f7 /e6 and e4/d5 versus c7/d6, and so forth. We see a truncated chain in some Ruy Lopez variations, when White plays d5, thus forming an opposition of e4/d5 ver sus c7 /d6/e5). Furthermore, pawn-chains with doubled pawns at their base will emerge from exchanges. Almost all of these can be looked at in the same terms as the traditional French and King's Indian chains; for example, in methods of attacking and defending them. Study of their common and contrasting ele ments will help you to master this part of the game. Let's start with the traditional examples and see what we can discover. We'll start out with the French Defence, probably the only opening in which the majority of its main variations have pawn-chains.
1 e4 e6 2 d4 d5 3 e5
The logic behind this move for White is that it claims space on the kingside and cramps the de velopment of Black's pieces. After 3 e5, Black's king's knight cannot go to its 'best' square on f6, and Black's queen's bishop, which was al ready blocked by its pawn on e6, is further in carcerated by the inability of the e6-pawn to advance. As mentioned, a variation well-suited for a discussion of chains continues: 3 ...c5 4 c3 tllc6 5 tll f3 (D) The last two moves are natural in that 4 ... tll c6 develops and exerts influence upon d4 and e5, whereas 5 tllf3 defends those points. Note first that if White had played 5 dxc5 he would have broken the chain, which would have weakened the front of the pawn-structure at e5. That pawn would then be subject to a greater threat of capture, like an isolated pawn which can't be defended with other pawns. It also could be exchanged more easily due to insufficient re sources for maintaining it. A direct attack could come by the moves ... 'filc7 and ... tll ge7-g6. Or the offer to exchange could be pursued via the pawn move ...f6. This leads to the idea that if Black can break down the d4 point, sometimes called the 'base' of the pawn-chain, he can cripple or destroy the pawn-structure itself. To what end? By getting rid of the pawn on d4 and then winning or ex changing the one on e5, a natural place would appear on f6 for the knight currently doing nothing on g8, and the move ...e5 would be more feasible. With a little luck that advance
THE SIGNIFICANCE OF STRUCTURE 49
would lead to the liberation of the c8-bishop, and in the meantime Black would control the action with his own 'ideal centre' of pawns on e5 and d5. This particular fantasy, for the mo ment out of reach without White's cooperation, motivates Black's desire to break down the chain at its base. As it turns out, locating the base of a pawn-chain is more of a practical than a theoretical determination; if Black played ...b5-b4, then White's pawn on c3 would be called the base of the chain, and in the unlikely event that Black played ... a5-a4-a3, then b2 would be so designated. Essentially it comes down to where one is most likely to succeed in undermining the chain. Returning to the French Defence and its 'ef fective' base at d4, we can see why White is in terested in maintaining his pawn there rather than playing dxc5 or allowing it to be captured. The two sides' conflicting goals might be played out by a variety of means. An example of the further play is: 5 ... �b6 Black attacks d4 again; for the moment the pawn is adequately protected. 6 .lte2 This develops pieces and prepares to castle. Another theme can arise if White plays 6 i.d3 .ltd7?! (6 ...cxd4 is normal) 7 dxc5 .ltxc5 8 O-O, when White gives up his supporting pawn but in return gains the possibility of b4-b5, when he can use the d4-square as an excellent support point for his pieces. 6 ...cxd4 7 cxd4 lllge7 Already White has to think about the health of his base, the d4-pawn. If he plays the most natural move on the board, 8 O-O?, that pawn is unavoidably lost after 8 ... lll f5. Obviously White would not play 8 O-O? but would'instead protect the pawn by, say, 8 b3 lllf5 9 .ltb2 (D). These moves are not necessarily the best, but they illustrate the basic idea. I've avoided a dis cussion of move-order subtleties in order to get the point across without unnecessary complica tions. The concept of attacking the base, first system atized by Nimzowitsch, rapidly spread through out the chess world and was treated as sort of a general principle of pawn-chains. It's interest ing that what are labelled chains are precisely those structures that can be attacked following this rule. For instance, few if any players refer to the lines of pawns from f7 to d5 and f2 to d4 in the Queen's Gambit Declined as pawn-chains, even when White plays c5 (as Steinitz used to do without provocation!). For example, 1 d4 d5 2 c4 e6 3 lllc3 .lte7 4 lll f3 lllf6 5 i.g5 h6 6 .lth4 lllbd7 7 e3 O-O 8 �cl a6 9 c5 c6 (D). Thinking in terms of pawn-chains isn't our habit in this case, because the traditional idea of how to break up a chain, that is, at its 'base' , doesn't apply. After 1 0 .ltd3, it's normally not on the cards for White to play b4-b5 (he's turn ing his eyes towards the king, a less trivial tar get). Black can attack in the centre by ...e5 (hardly with the idea of putting pressure on d4, however) or attack the front of the chain by 1 0. ..b6 1 1 cxb6 c5 ! ? , a sound idea although subject to tactical issues. What is the reality? Even in the French De fence example above, the standard illustration
50 MASTERING THE CHESS OPENINGS
of attacking the base, Black will end up by at tacking the protected front of the chain. For ex ample, after White successfully protects his base by 8 b3 lllf5 9 i.b2, Black's next step is to attack the front of the pawn-chain by .. .f6. For instance, one line goes 9 ... i.b4+ 1 0 @fl i.e7 1 1 tllc3 O-O 12 g3 f6 ( D) and White will soon surrender the leading pawn by exf6. Or, in the same Advance Variation, the phe nomenon is illustrated in the variation 3 e5 c5 4 c3 tllc6 5 tllf3 i.d7 6 i.e2 tllge7 7 O-O tllg6 with the intention of .. .f6 next or soon thereaf ter; for example, 8 tlla3 i.e7 9 lll c2 (White is still concerned with protecting the base at d4) 9 ... O-O 1 0 .l:.el cxd4 1 1 cxd4 f6 (D). Now the front of the pawn-chain disappears because of the three-way attack: 1 1 exf6 i.xf6. This time Black ignored the base and came out fine. Other French pawn-chain variations are clearer in that respect; e.g.:
1 e4 e6 2 d4 d5 3 ctJd2 tllf6 4 e5 tllfd7 5 i.d3
c5 6 c3 tllc6 7 tlle2 cxd4 8 cxd4 f6 The e5-pawn is attacked three times. 9 exf6 tllxf6 10 ctJf3 i.d6 1 1 O-O ( D) In this instance Black made only a half hearted attempt to attack the base of the pawn chain and then successfully attacked the front of it. So perhaps the procedure should be to attack the base and then the front? But then there's the following unadulterated example of attacking only the front of the chain:
1 e4 e6 2 d4 d5 3 llld2 tllc6 4 tllgf3 tll
f6 5 e5 llld7 6 i.d3 f6 (D) I should note that according to theory Black stands perfectly well in this position. Other openings attack chains in this manner; for ex ample, English Opening variations in which Black plays ...e4 and White eliminates the front pawn by f3. There are also Ruy Lopez varia tions in which d5 is met by ...c6 (e.g., the
THE SIGNIFICANCE OF STRUCTURE 51
Breyer Defence), and several King's Indian variations as well. Clearly we need a broader way of looking at this subject. Let's go to the King's Indian De fence example that's always used in the books:

By playing .. .f4 instead, he extends the chain to f3 in preparation for the march of his g-pawn. These are all normal moves, details of which will be given in the chapter on the King's Indian Defence in the next volume.

This example illustrates how important it is, in a game with pawn-chains, to have at least one file open for a rook to work with in a direct way next to the pawn-chain. Other pieces alone usu ally can't completely break down the oppo nent's position. Since White's pawn-chain is so impervious to assault in the foregoing variation, Black can think about challenging the front of the pawn chain, even when it's protected to the hilt. As seen in the French Defence examples, there are benefits to that approach. 9 ... a5 (D) First Black defends against b4, in tum pre venting the key move c5.

14 cxd5 14 exd5 gives Black a type of kingside ma jority that we shall see more of as we proceed. ... f5 will follow shortly. Suffice it to say that in general that situation is favourable to Black. •• Jks 15 .Bb2 axb4 16 axb4 The pawn-chain has been neutralized, prov ing that Black needn't only play on the side of the board where he has the undermining moves. The same applies to White. Chess is not so one-dimensional that you aren't permitted to think about more than one theme, at least not in the opening where we have so many pieces on the board. What's the upshot of all this? Is the practical player left without any guidance whatsoever? Not at all, because the more positions you see and play, the more tools that you acquire. As in any other situation in chess, you have to make an assessment of which positions call for which treatment. For instance, notice that Black ad dressed the front pawn on the queenside and never attended to the e4 base. How realistic is that in general? Let's imagine a similar position of a type that does arise in the French Defence:
1 e4 e6 2 d4 d5 3 lLld2 tt:Jf6 4 e5 lLlfd7 5 f4 c5
6 c3 tt:Jc6 7 lLldf3 .Be7 8 g3 'iVa5 9 Rf2 (D)
Here White has safeguarded his king (it can even go to g2 if necessary) and his pieces are about to spring out to aggressive positions; e.g., ..ild3, lLle2, with perhaps g4 and f5. How likely is that plan to succeed? The structure is analogous (d4/e5/f4 to c4/d5/e4), so Black's procedure would have to do with ...f6, perhaps preceded by ... h5, connected with ...g5. But the crucial difference is that this is the side of the board where Black' s king resides, so such a plan is unrealistic. A simple analysis (with a little bit of calculation) also tells you an attack on d4 won't get very far: not enough pieces and plenty of defenders. But if you're thinking in terms of pawn-chain experience, you'll see that Black should play to undermine White' s pawn-structure b y 9 •••b5! followed b y ...b4 and moves such as ... .l:Ib8, ...bxc3, ... .Ba6 and ... lLlb6-a4 in some intelligent order. This can be an effective idea as long as Black is alert to the defence of his king. With those ideas in mind, let's look at exam ples from the Caro-Kann Advance Variation.

Notice, however, that Black lost a tempo by playing ...c6-c5, and that he' s made an extra move with his light-squared bishop, which doesn't happen in the French. The point is that White is getting extra time to consolidate his space advantage and Black needs to break down the centre in some way be fore he becomes permanently cramped. Thus: 7 ...�b6 8 \\!Va4! This move would be worse than useless in the Exchange French because Black would play ... ..td7. 8 ... c4!? There springs up another pawn-chain ! This takes all the pressure off White's base while forming a new one. The plan is slow (and un usual) but there are special considerations. First, Black has to look at lines like 8 ... cxd4 9 ctJxd4 ! intending ..ll e3 next, with lll xf5 another prom ising idea; e.g., 9 ... .Bc5 10 lll xf5 exf5 1 1 b4 ..ll e7 1 2 ..ll e3 \\!Vd8 1 3 .l:idl . This is almost im possible to prevent without real compromise; for example, a pretty line runs 8 ... lll h6 9 dxc5 .Bxc5 10 b4 .Be7 1 1 ..ll e3 �c7 1 2 b5 and here 1 2. .. lllb8 1 3 b6+ �d7 1 4 �xa7 ! or 1 2. .. �a5 1 3 ..ll dl ! �xa4 1 4 ..llxa4 lll a5 1 5 b6+. There are many other lines with tactical and positional problems. So Seirawan reasons that he'll keep the position closed for a while, and by the time White organizes g4 and f5 he'll be winning on the other side of the board. 9 ctJbd2?! What do we know about such positions? The base of the enemy pawn-chain is far, far away, so it's not hard to see that the head must be at tacked.

When faced with a long-term space prob lem, like the one that Short created for his op ponent, waiting around is the worst thing to do. Look at whether attacking the base or front of the pawn-chain has any chance of succeed ing, then whether the two in combination can be effective. If not, you must create your own counterchances by hook or by crook, which structurally may amount to a radical advance of your own. Practically every opening system has its pawn-chain examples. What about some other shorter chains, or ones with outposts? How to assess them? The Benoni complex shows us a little variety. In the Czech Benoni it' s fairly easy to see the nature of the pawn-chains:
1 d4 lLlf6 2 c4 c5 3 d5 d6 4 lLlc3 e5 5 e4 (D)
Black would like to play for .. .f5 or ...b5, White for f4 or b4. In practice, White's breaks are more likely to succeed because of Black's lack of space or good squares for his pieces; e.g., he lacks c5 for his knights, or anywhere ac tive for his king's bishop (which is sometimes reduced to the exotic idea ...h6 and ... i.e7-g5). In particular Black has trouble enforcing .. .f5 if White sets up a structure involving ..ild3, ltJf3 and h3. Notice that the same pawn-structure in the King's Indian Main Line is more bearable for Black because with his bishop better-placed, he can get counterplay with .. .f5 before White squelches it. A Benko Gambit pawn-chain analysis re veals a little about the gambit's strengths. After

lowed by Black's recapture of the pawn over the next moves, White is very seldom able to en force an attack at the effective base of Black's pawn-chain at d6, and can only dream of achieving a successful b4 (it does happen, but only rarely). Black on the other hand has al ready eliminated the base of White's pawn chain on c4, and the move ...e6, cracking up the front pawn at d5, characterizes most Benko Gambit variations at one point or another. Take the Alekhine Defence, which actually includes a lot of pawn-chains. Here's the Four Pawns Attack, producing a partial chain after 1

Doubled Pawns and Related Pawn Captures Understanding of doubled pawns is essential to playing openings and eventually mastering them. As above, I'll approach this subject with some standard examples and then try to intro duce some more complicated ideas for you to chew over. Other structures will be discussed in conjunction with individual openings. Doubled pawns are a recurring motif in the Nimzo-Indian Defence. After 1 d4 CL:lf6 2 c4 e6
3 CL:lc3 ..llb4, capturing the c3-knight produces
doubled pawns, whose structure is such that the forward c-pawn is particularly vulnerable. Without getting into the jargon, you can see that a structure with pawns on c4, c3 and d3 is more secure than one with pawns on c4, c3 and d4. In the former case each pawn can be protected by another, whereas in the latter the c4-pawn is un supported. Here's a game with several thematic ideas in a typical Nimzo-Indian: Geller - Smyslov USSR Ch (Moscow) 1949
1 d4 CL:lf6 2 c4 e6 3 CL:lc3 ..llb4 4 a3 ..llxc3+ 5
bxc3 White now has doubled pawns on c3 and c4. The forward pawn is the target; note that if White's d-pawn were on d3, his doubled pawns would be protected. 5 ••. CL:lc6 6 f3 Having secured the advantage of the two bishops in compensation for his doubled pawns at c3 and c4, White wants to build a large centre and use his extra space to help in a kingside at tack. The kingside is a particularly good target because Black's dark-squared bishop has been exchanged and can't guard vulnerable squares around the king. 6 .•. b6 7 e4 ..lla6 Black is taking aim at White's weak c4- pawn.

8 ..llg5 And White begins to drift to the right. 8 •••h6 9 ..th4 tt:Ja5 There are more examples of this structure in Volume 2. 10 'iVa4 'iVc8! 11 lLlh3 lLlh7?! Better is 1 1 .. .°iVb7 ! 1 2 ..ild3 'iVc6! (D). By this means the c-pawn would have fallen, although Black's advantage might not be enough for a win after 1 3 'iVxc6 dxc6 1 4 e5 lLld7 1 5 Rf2 ii.xc4 1 6 .llc2. Capturing the c4-pawn di rectly is one theme; what happens in the game is related. 12 ..td3 O-O 13 e5 .l:Ie8 14 O-O tt:Jf8!? 15 tt:Jf4!? White should always maximize his kingside play in such positions and not worry much about a pawn or two on the queenside. Thus 1 5 f4 ! d5 16 f5 was called for, attacking the pawn chain. Notice that White's attack benefits greatly from the lack of Black's dark-squared bishop, which was exchanged off on the fourth move. 15 •.• d5! Black may not win the c-pawn but he wins the light squares. This is often the result of fighting against doubled pawns: the squares they are on become more important than the pawns themselves. 1 5. .. g5? isn't worth it after 16 ltJh5 gxh4 17 tt:Jf6+. 16 cxd5 ..txd3 17 lLlxd3 exd5 18 f4 ltJg6! Smyslov anticipates the idea of ... lDe7-f5. 19 ..tg3 °iVf5! Now Black begins a series of moves de signed to conquer an entire colour-complex. This was discussed in Chapter 2. 20 lLlb4 c6! 21 .tt ael 2 1 lLlxc6? °iVd7.
21...h5! 22 'iVc2 lLle7 (D)
Summing up: every important light square is covered by Black, whose knight will be in a dominating position on c4, with another knight coming to f5. To make things worse for White, his dark-squared bishop is bad and his rooks are inactive. This is all the logical result of the open ing, and of 1 5. .. d5 in particular. After many ups and downs, the game was eventually drawn, but Black has a winning position at this point. Next, a classic game that illustrates typical pros and cons of doubled pawns. Portisch - Fischer Sousse IZ 1967 1 lLlf3 tt:Jf6 2 g3 g6 3 c4 ..tg7 4 d4 O-O 5 .llg2 d6 6 tt:Jc3 tt:Jbd7 7 O-O e5 8 e4 c6 9 h3 °iVb6 10 .l:tel Oddly enough there's an important main line of this same variation that involves doubled pawns: 1 0 c5 ! ? dxc5 1 1 dxe5 lLle8 1 2 e6! fxe6 1 3 lLlg5 lLle5 ( 1 3. .. lLlc7 ! ?) 14 f4 ltJf7 1 5 lLlxf7 ..td4+ 16 Rh2 �xf7 (D). This has arisen in several games. Black is left with doubled c-pawns (resulting from a capture away from the centre), as discussed below, and a masked isolated pawn to boot.

Black nor mally plays ... ..td7 and ...cxd5 to cover a4. This
58 MASTERING THE CHESS OPENINGS
variation is generally another good illustration of how Black can play on the queenside in King's Indian Defence. 13 ..ll e3 \\!Vc7!? 14 ..llxc5!? The exchange on c5 to get doubled pawns can occur in many, many distinct positions of the King's Indian. White has to decide whether to give up his best bishop in order to cripple Black's pawn-structure. He usually declines the bargain. Here, however, he's a little ahead in time and goes for it. .•.dxcS 15 dxc6 bxc6 ( D) The first point is that 1 5. .. \\!Vxc6 would give White a huge and favourable outpost on d5, one that might be reinforced by CLJd2-fl-e3. What are the main characteristics of the po sition? Black's doubled pawns are isolated, and what's more he has an isolated pawn on a5. We've already mentioned, however, that iso lated a-pawns are usually not serious weak nesses until the endgame. What is typical about the doubled c-pawns is that they control very important central squares, both the black out post on d4 and most importantly White's d5, which is protected from intrusions. On the other hand, Black' s dark-squared bishop has very lit tle scope, so the advantage of two bishops is not yet a factor, and he has no pawn-breaks other than ...f5, which White can keep under control.
16 CL:la4
The forward doubled pawn is usually the more vulnerable one. Here White has no pros pects of attacking it along an open file because of his own c4-pawn, but he can focus pieces on it in order to tie Black's pieces to its defence. When a player's doubled pawn can be pro tected by adjacent pawns then his pieces need not be diverted to defend it. That's why iso lated doubled pawns are so much worse than connected ones, assuming that other factors aren't at work. 16 .•. ..trs 17 \\!Vb3 CL:lhs 18 \\!Ve3 \\!Va7 Black's pieces are passive and now White could try to transfer his f3-knight to b3, but if necessary Black can bring his knight to e6 or d7. What Portisch does instead is quite clever. 19 h4! This has the obvious idea of ..llh3, trying to exchange his bad bishop for Black's good one at c8. Bu.t White also sees that Black's best plan is the manoeuvre ... CL:lg7-e6-d4, which will leave his kingside less defended against the moves h5 and hxg6. .•.

Specifically, doubled c-pawns arise more often than any other type and they deter mine the nature of the play in many of those games. For the sake of clarity I'll concentrate on them, with a brief look first at a particular central situation. Doubled Centre Pawns Doubled centre pawns arise much less often in the opening than doubled c-pawns. They are generally produced by exchanges of minor pieces on the third or fourth rank, and usually don't allow of the choice of recaptures that we saw above. Their effects on the position tend to be ambiguous. This is a position from Chapter 6 on the Two Knights Defence; similar situations can arise from a number of 1 e4 e5 openings. White plays ..ll e3 to challenge the enemy bishop on c5 (like wise with colours reversed, of course). Cap turing that bishop on e3 will help White to gain central control (in particular of d4, which was a potential support-point for Black's knight), and he will have the open f-file to work with. But the resulting centre e3/e4/d3 is generally not
60 MASTERING THE CHESS OPENINGS
mobile. What does that mean? After the ex change on e3, White' s pawns are initially well protected; it's usually difficult to get at the single weakness at e3. However, if White plays d4 thereafter, the forward e-pawn will be unpro tected by another pawn and therefore vulnera ble, just as the c4-pawn was in the Nimzo-Indian example above. And if the d-pawn advances fur ther to d5, the e-pawn may not be able to move for the rest of the game. Both sides have to weigh whether one advantage or the other is more important. If Black isn't going to exchange on e3, one of his options is to leave the bishop where it is on c5. Normally the doubled pawns that Black would get if White played ..ll xc5 wouldn't be harmful (see the discussion of c pawns below); but that's not always true. The same idea comes up in the Ruy Lopez after 1 e4 e5 2 CLJf3 CLJc6 3 i.b5 a6 4 ..lla4 CLJf6 5 O-O ..ll e7 6 .l:tel b5 7 ..llb3 d6 8 c3 ..ll e6, as well as in some queen' s pawn variations; e.g., 1 d4 d5 2 CLJf3 e6 3 ..ll f4 CLJf6 4 e3 CLJbd7 5 i.e2 ..ll d6 (D). Again the choice arises of whether White should: a) exchange bishops on d6, allowing ... cxd6 if Black wants to; b) leave his bishop on f4, inviting ...i.xf4; or c) retreat to g3. In master play all three solutions are played. This position is simplified but shows the basic situation that arises in many variations. Isolated doubled e- and d-pawns are rare when the queens are off the board; neverthe less, an opening line such as 1 e4 d6 2 d4 CLJf6
3 CLJc3 e5 4 dxe5 dxe5 5 \\!Vxd8+ �xd8 6 i.c4
..lle6 ! ? 7 ..llxe6 fxe6 shows that it' s possible to adopt such pawns in that situation. The result ing position is one that current theory indi cates is equal. See Chapter 7 on the Philidor Defence, in particular the discussion of early move-orders. It bears repeating that the exchange of queens by no means betokens entrance into an end game, because there can be many active pieces remaining on the board producing astonish ingly complex positions. The phrase 'queenless middlegame' doesn't appear often enough in chess discussion, written or otherwise. It de scribes an extremely large set of situations, often lasting for the bulk of the game. The conditions for a decisive result are still there, as shown by literally thousands of games. But for our pur poses it's important to note that a lot of queen exchanges such as the one above result in queenless openings! Although the boundaries of the queenless opening, middlegame and end ing are to some extent a matter of judgement, variations in which the queens have been ex changed within the first 10 moves are routinely analysed by players and theoreticians for an other 10 moves, and clearly belong to the terri tory of the opening proper. Finally, we run across 5th-rank doubled pawns in just a few openings; for example, 1 c4 c5 2 CLJc3 CLJc6 3 g3 g6 4 ..llg2 i.g7 5 d3 CLJf6 6 e4 O-O 7 CL:lge2 d6 8 O-O CLJd4 9 CLJxd4 cxd4 10 CLJe2 (D).

play difficult because White will be ready to re spond to ... e6 and ... d5 by cxd5 and e5 ( espe cially if the move f4 has been played), whereas Black' s move ...e5 would restrict his own bishop and isn't very helpful with respect to mobility. The opponent (in this case White) can play 'around' the pawn by f4, intending f5 and g4, and/or by b4. This is a theme worth remember ing as it arises fairly frequently in openings such as the Closed Sicilian, King's Indian and English Opening. It tends to occur in the move sequence above, with a knight on d4 (from White' s point of view) being captured by a knight on e2 or f3. In many cases there would be a bishop on e3 in the above case, say, by 8 ... llld7 9 .Be3 lll d4 (D). In this instance White's knight can't capture on d4 because of the fork, and most players will avoid giving away their good bishop by .Bxd4, dead spot or not. So you will commonly see players wait until a bishop comes to e3 before occupying the outpost with their knight. It also frequently happens that when a bishop arrives at e3, White is just ready to play d4, so Black's knight jump has a double purpose. Obviously all of this is true with colours reversed as well. Naturally there are no absolutes and the dead-point structure isn't always bad, but one should be careful that there are compensating factors before adopting it. Doubled c-Pawns Now let's move on to doubled c-pawns, which are far more common than central ones. The most frequent exchange in the opening that leads to doubled pawns is when a knight on c3 or c6 is captured by a knight or bishop. Then a basic decision often presents itself: whether one wants to recapture with a b-pawn ( 'strength ening' the centre) or with the ct-pawn, opening lines for development. There are plenty of situ ations in which there is no choice; for instance,
1 d4 lllf6 2 c4 e6 3 lbc3 .Bb4 4 a3 .Bxc3+ 5
bxc3 or 1 e4 e6 2 d4 d5 3 lll c3 .Bb4 4 e5 c5 5 a3 .Bxc3+ 6 bxc3, both cases where the prece dence of structure is conspicuous. In neither case does either player have many pieces de veloped, but by their pawn moves both sides have established a structure that will serve and determine their development. In both of these cases the players were forced to capture 'towards the centre', the advice given to students everywhere. But it's more re vealing to look first at recaptures requiring a decision.

The usual lines go: al) 5 O-O d6 6 d4 f6 7 lllc3, when White controls the centre and has a simple lead in de velopment (three pieces to none).

It' s a bad sign if Black has to surrender the cen tre in a centre-strengthening variation! b) 4 ... dxc6 is well-known and doesn't re quire special analysis. What counts is that the recapture away from the centre affords wide open play for the bishops. bl) The line 5 d4 exd4 6 �xd4 �xd4 7 lbxd4 �d7 and ... O-O-O illustrates Black's ideas. He will gladly play with a pawn-structure such as ...c5 and ... b6. b2) The generally-approved move 5 O-O has other attributes, but again the fact that a varia tion such as 5 ...�g4 6 h3 h5 7 d3 �f6 even ex ists shows that Black has dynamic counter play. In fact, White often plays c3 and d4 versus the ...c5/. ..e5 structure, allowing the doubled pawns to be liquidated and therefore indicating that they weren't the sole reason for playing 4 �xc6.

'it>xd8 also shows that Black is willing to play this pawn-structure. For more on this subject see Chapter 8 on the Ruy Lopez. Overall, we can say that in this particular opening, Black's choice of developing and acti vating his bishops by capturing away from the centre leads to better positions than if he de cides upon a more compact pawn-structure by capturing towards the centre. Rossolimo Variation of the Sicilian Defence This positionally instructive opening is defined by 1 e4 c5 2 lLif3 lbc6 3 �b5, and has numer ous lines with �xc6. I'll pick a few. a) 3 ...g6 and then: a l ) 4 �xc6 and now: a l l) 4 ... bxc6 5 O-O �g7 6 .l:!.el gives another lead in development which particularly shows up after 6 ... lbf6 7 e5 lbd5 8 c4 lbc7 9 d4! cxd4 10 �xd4 with space and the simple idea �h4 and �h6. Thus 6 ... lbh6 with the idea .. .f6 is preferred by top masters, when the play seems to favour White slightly but Black has squares for his pieces and the extra centre pawn gives him a certain leeway, so in the hands of a knowledgeable player 4 ... bxc6 isn't bad. Nev ertheless, we can't say that it' s fully satisfac tory. al2) Black can equalize by capturing away from the centre: 4 ... dxc6 5 d3 �g7 and 6 O-O lLif6 or 6 h3 e5 works out well him. White is not able to achieve an effective d4 or e5, so Black gets easy development for his pieces. a2) 4 O-O �g7 5 .l:!.el e5 6 �xc6 and then: a21 ) 6 ... bxc6?! 7 c3 lbe7 8 d4 cxd4 9 cxd4 exd4 10 lbxd4 O-O 1 1 lbc3 (D) is notoriously better for White. Even in the reversed position from the Eng lish Opening, Black usually gets the better of this position with one less move to use. The problem is that 1 l ...d5? gives White too much pressure after 1 2 exd5 cxd5 1 3 �g5. But other wise Black's dark squares are weak and 1 l ...d6 presents a target down the d-file. Notice that this Sicilian Rossolimo is similar to the Ex change Ruy Lopez that we just looked at, in that both variations have lines in which the pawn break d4 is paradoxically strong even though it straightens out the opponent's pawns. a22) By contrast, 6 ... dxc6 7 d3 �e7 has tra ditionally been considered equal with careful play. The d-file is handy for Black and White's move d4, a poor one, would only open up the game for Black's bishops. b) 3 ... e6 4 �xc6 and here: bl) 4 ... bxc6 5 O-O lbe7 6 :el (these are hardly forced moves, just illustrations of the

5 O-O 'Viii
c7 6 e5 and moves such as b3, iL.b2, d3 and llld2-c4 can follow. If he had an extra cen tre pawn (as he does after 4 ...bxc6), Black could play ... f6 and break up White's centre, but in this case exf6 would expose a weak pawn on e6. In making a decision how to recapture in the Rossolimo Variation, a major consideration is whether Black can achieve ...e5 after taking with the d-pawn. If so, White has no particular way to gain space, because now c3 followed by d4 merely opens the centre for Black's bishops. But if Black captures with the b-pawn he has to watch out that an early d4 doesn't leave him too far behind in development (he has no open d-file to challenge a white piece on d4). In particular, the variations in which Black fianchettoes his bishop can put his development behind sched ule. Petroff Defence

Recapturing with the ct-pawn is the very point of 5 lll c3, to get White's pieces out quickly with additional pressure down the open d-file if O-O-O follows. Having pawns on c2 and c3 is easy for White to handle, just as ... dxc6 was in the Ruy Lopez. The difference is that in this Petroff line both sides have two bishops, so it' s unlikely that White has anything special in the way of a permanent advantage. Nevertheless, taking with the ct-pawn is more promising than 6 bxc3, which would leave White with a restricted cen tre in which one of his bishops wouldn't be able to assume an active role. Scotch Game In the Scotch Game with 1 e4 e5 2 lll f3 lll c6 3 d4 exd4 4 lll xd4 lllf6 5 lllxc6, 5 ...bxc6 is the almost automatic recapture. This is still an un resolved line, but Black's queenside structure doesn't hurt him in most lines. Two examples with this type of structure: Rublevsky - Bologan Dortmund 2004

Another set of choices confronts Black in the main-line variation 4 ...�c5 5 lbxc6 �f6 ! 6 �d2 dxc6 7 lbc3 lbe7 8 �f4. Without getting too theoretical, it's relevant to observe that Black wants to take on another set of doubled pawns after 8 ... lbg6 ! ? 9 �xf6 gxf6, as in Kasparov Topalov, Las Palmas 1 997. How to assess this kind of thing? It takes some experience but also a little calculation. Black has a temporary lead in development and ifhe could castle queenside and/or exchange off his f-pawn by ...f5, he'd leave White having to defend squares such as c2 and f2. Thus slow moves from White are not dangerous. But 1 0 �d3 isn't much of a solution because it runs into 1 0. .. lbh4 1 1 @fl ( 1 1 O-O? l:tg8 12 g3 �h3 1 3 :ctl lLif3+ 1 4 '>ithl �xf2) 1 1 . .. .l::t g8 1 2 g3 .lii. h3+, which is at least equal.

White has foreseen something analogous to the Rossolimo Variation above. Black can't move his d-pawn without one problem or an other. White's queenside complex actually pro tects him from intrusions on the b-file, and his possession of the a-file is a bonus. 1 1. .. d5 12 exd6 �xd6? Notice that this is an example of the vanishing centre! Since Black has no attack he has no real compensation for the weak c-pawns. 1 2. .. cxd6 must be a little better. On the other hand, Black's centre pawns would still be weak and White could probe the kingside. There might follow 1 3 �d3 ! ?

The question is always whether the bishop-pair compensates for the doubled c-pawns. By themselves the bishops usually aren't sufficient to offset the pawns, but the capture has also seriously weakened squares on the opponent's kingside. Getting a feel for this trade-off is more a matter of expe rience, so here's a small selection of a few very lightly annotated games. The first is a win by White in a variation that's arisen hundreds of times: Korchnoi - H. Bohm Wijk aan Zee 1980

The usual considerations with respect to Black's dark squares on the kingside apply in principle, but there is little chance that they will become a real factor. If you want to continue investigating the is sue of captures away from and towards the centre, there will probably be instances of both in the openings that you play. The more that you study these and get to experience them, the better a player you'll be in the widest sense. Hanging Pawns The term 'hanging pawns' is habitually used to refer to black pawns on c5 and d5 separated from Black's other pawns by at least a file on both sides. The hanging pawns are usually pit ted against a white pawn on e3 and open d- and c-files. Of course the same applies with colours reversed. This structure generally arises from two pawn exchanges on c5 and d5, but it can also come about when an isolated pawn is transformed by a piece exchange on c6. Like 'isolated pawns' , the term 'hanging pawns' is defined more broadly, but it doesn't seem to extend beyond this single case when actually being discussed. That is understand able, because so few analogous structures reg ularly arise, at least in the opening. You could call pawns on e4 and d4 'hanging' under cer tain circumstances, but that's not convention ally done. Returning to the basic position, Black's hanging pawns have advantages and disadvan tages. Much as is the case with an isolated d pawn, Black has the persistent possibility of breaking the position up by ... d4, thus extend ing the range of his pieces, initiating favour able tactics, and/or creating a powerful passed pawn. The hanging pawns also cover key cen tral squares and give Black's pieces somewhat more manoeuvring room than White's. Finally, the e- and b-files can be used to create dynamic chances. From White's point of view there are many promising ways to attack this structure. Most of them begin by restricting the advance of the d pawn. White has a pawn, a knight (sometimes two), and a rook or two on an open file to achieve this, with a bishop on b2 for good ef fect. Once the pawn is 'fixed', White can do one of several things: a) Attack it with his pieces; e.g., a bishop on g2, knight on c3 and/or f4, and rook(s) on an open file. The queen and rooks are particularly effective attackers of hanging pawns. b) Advance a pawn to b4 or e4 to force a desirable change in pawn-structure. If White's advancing pawn either captures Black's or vice versa, an isolated pawn remains in Black's camp. Or, if one of Black's pawns advances, it creates a juicy outpost for White to the side of it. For example: if White attacks with e4 and Black responds with . . .d4, then the c4-square is available for a piece. c) Exchange pieces and simplify the posi tion; as is the case with an isolated queen's pawn, this reduces the pawns' dynamic possi bilities and makes them easier to put under pressure.

Normally, we only talk about a majority when the pawns in question are connected, i.e. there is no empty file between them. Putting that into a real-world context, here is a Griinfeld Defence in which Black has a queenside majority (2 to 1, hence forth '2: l ' ), White has a central majority (2: 1 ), and the pawns are evenly divided on the king side (3:3): The other way to express this is that there are two connected sets of pawns ('pawn islands '), so that we have 2: 1 on the queenside and 5:4 in the centre and kingside. I think that imparts less information, so I'll divide centre and flank pawns, with the exception that if
THE SIGNIFICANCE OF STRUCTURE 71
there is a single centre pawn on the board and it is connected with other pawns on the flank, I may group them together, an important case being the 4:3 kingside set-up that we shall run into in the course of discussing openings with that pawn distribution. One way of thinking about the Griinfeld De fence main line above is that White's centre is under pressure by direct threats and other in conveniences from an enemy who has no tar gets of attack in his own position. What's more, there aren't even prospective targets of attack in the near future! This sounds one-sided until you take into account that White is protecting a central majority, possibly the most valuable as set in chess in the realm of pawns and struc tures. How is that? First, two central pawns control more central points than one, in itself an advantage. Then, after a protracted struggle to survive the constant threats to their lives and/or their integrity, a central pawn-majority can sweep across the board and scatter the op ponent's pieces, sometimes exacting material tribute along the way. Even more frequently a central majority can be transformed into a passed pawn that is difficult or impossible to stop. That is precisely what happens when things go wrong for Black in many variations of the Griinfeld Defence. Barring such a trium phant journey, a central majority has other ad vantages. It can advance far enough to grant abundant room for friendly pieces to roam, but can also provide the maximum security to the pieces behind it. There are even advantages to having a central pawn-majority that resides on the third rank. The most important situation in which that occurs is in the Open Sicilian, in which Black always has a central majority to begin with, because White has played 3 d4 cxd4 4 lll xd4, as in this example (see following diagram): The pawns on d6 and e6 protect against threatening incursions by putting all of White's important 5th-rank squares under pawn super vision. They combine that with a threat to ad vance, when they would give Black's pieces freer play and begin to restrict White's. Such a majority can compensate for a space disadvan tage elsewhere, because the main value of a space advantage is the ability to shift forces about more easily, and that can be limited by the necessity of keeping White's pieces fairly rigidly poised to prevent Black' s central expan sion. Even though White' s centre pawn in this example is more advanced than Black' s are, it can still cover only one central square, namely, d5. To illustrate this, we might ask why ...b5 is so effective in the Sicilian Defence (when Black has pawns on e6 and d6). A large part of the rea son is a well-timed ... b4, of course, to drive away the c3-knight (e.g., to e2) and then either put pressure on White's e-pawn or successfully achieve a pawn-break in the centre. But White often plays g4-g5 himself and drives away the f6-knight (e.g., to d7). Often that has less effect as regards positional con siderations in the centre. What's the differ ence? The central majority. Let's pretend that Black had only a pawn on d6 and White has his usual central pawn on e4. Then driving away White's c3-knight might be of about the same importance as White's driving away the
71 MASTERING THE CHESS OPENINGS
f6-knight. Furthermore, the lack of an e-pawn for Black would mean seriously weakened de fence against White' s pieces occupying cen trally-oriented squares, specifically d5 and f5. For example, if Black' s e-pawn were missing, then d5 would be an attractive outpost that would be further weakened if White could force Black' s knight off f6 by g4-g5 . In that kind of a position a knight on f5 is also notori ous for tearing Black's position to shreds. As it is, since Black's pawn is on e6, White's lim ited central pawn presence in the Open Sicil ian also allows Black to use influential squares for his purposes, such as c5 and e5 for his knights. Then the knights will have fewer ob stacles to reaching c4 or attacking e4. Of course, in 'extra-positional' terms, White has the opportunity for violent attacks based upon the pawn advances e5 and f5, and/or sac rifices on f5, e6, d5 and b5. With a single inac curacy by Black (or merely choosing the wrong variation), these attacks can be so powerful as to decimate the defence. Otherwise no one would play White's side of an Open Sicilian. I simply want to demonstrate Black's underlying reason for accepting a cramped position. See Chapter 1 1 on the Sicilian for other illustrations of how his central majority functions in diverse situa tions, such as the Paulsen and Dragon Varia tions. The next diagram shows another type of cen tral majority in the Open Sicilian arising from 1 e4 c5 2 lZ'Bf3 d6 3 d4 cxd4 4 lLixd4 lZ'Bf6 5 lLic3 lZ'Bc6 6 j_e2 e5 7 lZ'Bb3 j_e6 (D). Although by comparison with the previous example, Black has a more vulnerable structure of pawns (on d6 and e5), White's knights are denied e4 and d4, so that defending d5 is really Black' s only practical concern, just as White himself must watch out for ... d5. Again, see Chapter 1 1 on the Sicilian for various exam ples. What are some other common central pawn majorities? White finds himself with this ma jority in several variations of the Griinfeld De fence such as the one mentioned above and in the important variation 1 d4 lZ'Bf6 2 c4 g6 3 lZ'Bc3 d5 4 lZ'Bf3 j_g7 5 l'lb3 dxc4 6 l'lxc4. In the Queen's Gambit Exchange Variation White as sumes a 2: 1 majority on move four ( 1 d4 d5 2 c4 e6 3 lLic3 lZ'Bf6 4 cxd5 exd5), and in the Queen's Gambit Accepted he gets it on move two ( 1 d4 d5 2 c4 dxc4). White also ends up with an extra centre pawn in many variations of the English Opening in which Black plays ... d5 (an example would be 1 c4 c5 2 lZ'Bc3 lZ'Bf6 3 lZ'Bf3 d5 4 cxd5 lZ'Bxd5). Finally, every Modem Benoni variation has Black accepting a 2: 1 deficit from the start ( 1 d4 lZ'Bf6 2 c4 c5 3 d5 e6 4 lZ'Bc3 exd5 5 cxd5). There aren't a great many 2:0 central majori ties in standard openings, although examples do exist. Take the Nimzo-Indian variation with
1 d4 lZJf6 2 c4 e6 3 lZ'Bc3 j.,b4 4 l'lc2 d5 5 cxd5
l'Bxd5 6 lZ'Bf3 l'Bf5 7 l'Bxf5 exf5 (D ). Ironically, this position seems to be perfectly playable for Black. White's difficulty is that when he finally organizes f3 and e4, Black can capture on e4 and will have an f-pawn in re serve to restrain or even attack the centre. There are a growing number of openings in which this structure arises.
THE SIGNIFICANCE OF STRUCTURE 73
In conclusion, whether central majorities are inherent to a specific opening or not, they are extremely important and tend to assert them selves in the long run. Defenders must be sure to have a clear plan for neutralizing them, some times by transforming the structure itself before the pawn-majority can do any damage. The corresponding issue has to do with queenside majorities and minorities, since cen tral majorities for one side almost always leave the other side with a queenside majority. Since most majorities can in principle be transformed into a passed pawn, it has been said that a queenside majority is advantageous because the resulting passed pawn will usually be an outside passed pawn and thus of special value. That is, in a king and pawn ending, one king will have to go chasing after the queenside passed pawn in order to stop it from promoting, while the other king mops up on the enemy pawns on the kingside. Unfortunately, several considerations interfere with this optimistic scenario. First, if both kings are centralized (as hap pens in many endings) neither majority neces sarily results in a passed pawn further 'outside' than the other. Secondly, the hypothetical ad vantage of the queen side majority is reversed if the parties castle queenside. But since kingside castling is the rule, a more compelling issue arises that especially impacts the opening (our area of concern, after all): the relation of ma jorities to king safety. Since there are more pieces on the board in the opening, the ad vance of kingside pawns to create a passed pawn carries with it the risk of exposing one's own king; obviously, doing the same with a queenside majority is safer. On the other hand, the results of a kingside advance may be to put the opposing king in danger, whereas defence against a queenside majority doesn't require any compromise of the king's position! These many considerations suggest a sort of theoretical balance between the types of major ities, depending upon concrete features of the position. As a practical matter in the opening stage of the game, one shouldn't pay much at tention to the matter of majorities and minori ties, apart from their value in beginning to pursue a specific plan. The odds are that the pawn-structure will be transformed prior to the onset of the endgame. This brings us to the minority attack, which involves two pawns attacking three. It is fa mously effective in the Sicilian Defence, in volving ... b5 and ... b4, sometimes supported by ... a5, driving away White's knight from c3 and/or gaining open files. The exposure of White's queenside renders his majority irrele vant in most cases, at least in so far as creating passed pawns is concerned. The most famous minority-attack structure is 2:3, 2: 1 and 3:3, sometimes called the Carls bad pawn-structure. Numerous books discuss the minority at tack by b4-b5 in great detail because its appli cation is widespread, although not necessarily in the pure form shown. The most important examples that directly conform to the model in the diagram are in the Queen's Gambit Ex change Variation and a few other variations of the Queen's Gambit Declined. The Carlsbad pawn-structure also emerges in the Nimzo Indian Defence following 1 d4 llJf6 2 c4 e6 3 lZ:Jc3 .tb4 4 Wic2 d5 5 cxd5 exd5 6 .tg5 h6 7 .txf6 Wixf6 8 a3 .txc3+ 9 Wixc3. Then Black often feels compelled to play ... c6 in the face of c-file pressure, making White's minority attack by b4-b5 all the more effective. Interestingly, the Caro-Kann has the same pawn distribution with colours reversed after 1 e4 c6 2 d4 d5 3 exd5 cxd5 4 .td3 lZ:Jc6 5 c3 llJf6; in fact, you will find an example of a pure minority attack by Black in Chapter 12. The most thorough discussion of minority attacks in this set of books will naturally be linked to the Queen's Gambit Exchange Variation (covered in Vol ume 2).
74 MASTERING THE CHESS OPENINGS
In addition to this there are related positions. For instance, a minority-attack situation comes up in the Griinfeld Defence after 1 d4 tll f6 2 c4 g6 3 tll c3 d5 4 tll f3 il.g7 5 .tg5 tll e4 6 cxd5 tllxg5 7 tllxg5 e6 8 tll f3 exd5. Then White's strategy is based upon b4-b5, whether or not Black gives him a target by playing ...c6. These positions share the same basic ideas but natu rally have their own subtleties. The Modern Benoni provides a good exam ple of a central majority versus a queenside ma jority: White has the central majority, which sets the stage in and of itself. We know that central majorities are vitally important and generally underrated. Let's think about the King's Indian Defence ( 'KID') vis-a-vis the Benoni. They both take the same number of tempi to arrive at their basic position, and in the Benoni Black's bishop is on a powerful open diagonal whereas in the King's Indian Black's bishop is blocked by its own pawn. How can the King's Indian as an opening be considered the equal of or supe rior to the Benoni? I think that the answer rests mostly with the pawn-majority. In the King's Indian Defence, Black and White go on pawn chain assaults. White's attack consists of, for example, c4, b4 and c5 with tll d2-c4 and cxd6. What has White accomplished? He has spent all those moves to create a weak pawn on d6, but that pawn is only exposed to attack by pieces, since Black's c-pawn has replaced his d-pawn. However, in the Benoni Black's pawn is already sitting alone on d6 without the expen diture of 6 or more moves by White to get it there ! What's more, White's e-pawn is always threatening to advance to e5, breaking up Black' s pawn-structure and opening up the game in favour of White's more aggressively placed pieces. Naturally that's not the end of the story. Unlike Black in the King's Indian, the Benoni player has the unrestrained bishop on g7 and a clear shot at White's e-pawn along an open file. Moreover, he has a mobile queen side majority that can cause considerable disar ray in White's camp. But understanding the role of majorities and minorities explains a lot about these and other openings. The Light-Square Restraint Structure Because of their increasing popularity, we'll take a look at structures with ... c6 and ...e6 ver sus two white pawns, one on d4 and the other on either c4 or e4. I'll call these 'restraint structures' or a 'restraint centre ' , because their function is to restrain the advance of White's d-pawn. Four of many openings with versions of this set-up are: a) The Caro-Kann Defence: 1 e4 c6 2 d4 d5. Now several sequences produce the basic struc ture; for instance, 3 tll c3 dxe4 4 tllxe4 and now either 4 ... .tf5 5 tllg3 il.g6 (with ... e6 to come) or 4 ... tll d7 5 tllg5 tllgf6 6 il.d3 e6 and similar lines. Another example is 1 e4 c6 2 tll f3 d5 3 tll c3 .tg4 4 h3 .txf3 5 l'Bxf3 e6 6 d4 dxe4 7 tll xe4 (D). In these lines White retains his c pawn but not his e-pawn. b) The Scandinavian Defence: 1 e4 d5 2 exd5 �xd5 3 tll c3 �a5 4 d4 tll f6 5 tll f3 .tf5 6 .td2 c6 7 .tc4 e6. There are numerous variants
THE SIGNIFICANCE OF STRUCTURE 75
of this opening with the same structure, includ ing lines with ... ..Bg4, ... ..Bxf3 and ...e6. In the Scandinavian, as in the Caro-Kann, White is left with a c-pawn but no e-pawn. c) The Slav/Semi-Slav: in the traditional Slav lines we have 1 d4 d5 2 c4 c6 3 lLif3 lLif6 4 lLic3 dxc4 5 a4 ..Bf5 6 e3 e6 7 ..Bxc4, and in the Semi-Slav Meran Variation 1 d4 d5 2 c4 c6 3 lLif3 lLif6 4 lLic3 e6 5 e3 ltJbd7 6 ..Bd3 dxc4 7 .llxc4. These are two of many examples of the basic structure. By contrast with the first two openings, White remains with an e-pawn but no c-pawn. d) The Queen's Gambit Declined: in the Classical Capablanca and Lasker Variations, we have 1 d4 d5 2 c4 e6 3 lLic3 lLif6 4 ..Bg5 ..Be7
5 e3 O-O 6 lLif3 ltJbd7 (or 6 ...h6 7 ..Bh4 lLie4 8
.llxe7 'fll xe7 9 .l:!.cl lLixc3 10 .t:rxc3 c6 1 1 ..Bd3 dxc4 12 ..Bxc4 ltJd7) 7 .:te l c6 8 ..Bd3 dxc4 9 .llxc4. In this opening White again ends up with an e-pawn but no c-pawn. Generally, White's first goal is expansion in the centre, in the one case by c4 and d5, in the other by e4 and d5. These are difficult to achieve given Black's pawn-structure, which is specifi cally designed to prevent d5, and Black is ready to play ... e5 or ...c5 at the first opportunity. But White also has other resources, including using the support-point at e5 (and sometimes at c5) to make threats and favourably transform the cen tral situation. Or he can expand on the wings. In some of these variations, Black's light squared bishop comes out in front of its pawns. Then Black already has some freedom for his pieces and can take more time to play for a transformation of the pawn-structure. When the bishop is stuck behind its pawns, as in the Queen's Gambit or the Caro-Kann with 4 ... ltJd7, Black needs to get ...e5 or ... c5 in as a freeing move, preferably sooner rather than later, if he is to equalize. The ... c5 move not only loosens White's grip on the centre but if followed up by ... cxd4 it claims the c5-square for Black's pieces, often a knight. In that case we have something similar to various French Defence lines with 1 e4 e6 2 d4 d5 3 lLic3 (or 3 ltJd2 dxe4) 3 ... dxe4 (or 3 ... lLif6 4 ..Bg5 dxe4) 4 lLixe4 lLid7 5 lLif3 ltJgf6 6 lLixf6+ lLixf6, where Black will generally play for . . .c5. If Black can play ...e5, he attacks the centre but also frees his light-squared bishop. It's better to show a few examples than to speak in generalities. Gulko - Lakdawala USA Ch (San Diego) 2004

For example, that situation typically arises in a Giuoco Piano with d3 ( 1 e4 e5 2 lLif3 lLic6 3 .tc4 .tc5 4 d3), when Black's bishop is on c5 and White's bishop goes to e3. Then when Black plays ... ..Bxe3 and White recaptures by fxe3 we have the mirror image. I discuss this at some length in Chapter 5. Returning to our game, Black soon unneces sarily straightens out White's pawns for him, and creates our restraint centre. .••h6 11 .tf4 dxe4!? 12 dxe4 'fll a5 The ...c6/ ...e6 centre arises.

Black is well-developed, and if he gets ...c5 in it will open up the b7-bishop and activate his game. The issue then is whether White can make use of any particular advan tages that he has in advance of that freeing move. The dark squares and aggressively-placed pieces look good, so the first question is: where is Black weak? The squares c5, e5 and d6 may be vulnerable, and if you've foreseen the move 15 .tg5 before playing 1 3 c4, that should be enough to convince you to go ahead. 13• •. bxc4 14 lZ'Bxc4 'Yi'c7 15 .tgS!

Previous knowledge of the properties of ...c6/ ...e6 restriction and the standard IQP posi tion, as well as recognizing the similarity to the Meran Variation, undoubtedly helped White to find his way in this game. That is an illustration of what I call 'cross-pollination' , discussed be low. Rather than trying to fight directly against the ...c6/ ...e6 complex, it's sometimes better to give up on d5 and transform the structure. In this famous game White does so by using his support-points: Spassky - Petrosian Moscow Wch (13) 1966

White has the advantage. He can exploit the weakness on e6, or play for a well-timed 0,c5. Spassky went on to win the game. Space and Structure The relationship of space to structure is poten tially an immense subject, but I just want to make a few comments about it. We know that White is the one who will generally grab more space in the opening (particularly in the major openings discussed in this book). Several situ ations can arise for Black. In the Closed Sys tem of the Ruy Lopez and several other double e-pawn openings, Black's strongpoint on e5 (based upon the pawn-chain c7-d6-e5) and his b5-pawn establish a sufficient command of ter ritory that he doesn't usually feel the need to acquire more. The Chigorin set-up with ... 0,a5 and ...c5 is an exception, in that it is clearly aimed at extending Black's territorial reach; but that this policy is not necessary is shown by the popular Breyer, Zaitsev, M0ller and Smyslov Variations (see Chapter 8 on the Ruy Lopez for examples). To some extent this is also true with the double d-pawn openings such as the Queen's Gambit Declined and Slav. Nevertheless, in the traditional Queen's Gambit variations Black tends to play for ...e5 at some point, arguably exchanging one type of territorial control (the d5-pawn) for another that also activates his pieces. In the Dutch Variation of the Slav ( 1 d4
82 MASTERING THE CHESS OPENINGS
d5 2 c4 c6 3 lllf3 lllf6 4 lll c3 dxc4 5 a4 iLf5 6 e3), Black is generally in no hurry to play ... e5 or even ... c5, which also true of several of the other ...e6/ ... c6 restraint openings that we saw above, especially since his queen's bishop is outside his pawn-chain. By contrast, look at many of the other major d-pawn openings. In the King's Indian Defence main lines (e.g., 1 d4 lllf6 2 c4 g6 3 lllc3 ii.g7 4 e4 d6 followed by ...O-O and ...e5), once White takes space in the centre, Black will seldom be satisfied that the single central pawn on e5 fully represents his interests in that sector. Without further pawn moves he will slowly be strangled by White's central and queenside pawn ad vances. Therefore you will almost always see a rapid .. .f5, or in some cases an attempt to take over territory on the queenside by ... c6 or ...c5. Likewise in the Modern Benoni (1 d4 lllf6 2 c4 c5 3 d5 e6 4 lll c3 exd5 5 cxd5 d6 followed by ...g6, ...ii.g7, ...O-O, etc.), Black can almost never be satisfied with the central control of fered by his c5-pawn. In most variations he is almost compelled to win more space by ... b5 or .. .f5 or get strangled by White's pieces and on rushing pawns. In the Semi-Slav, a combina tion of ... dxc4 and ... b5, or ... dxc4, ... ii.d6 and ... e5 is customary before White extends his con trol over the central squares (note that Black's light-squared bishop is trapped behind his pawns). What about the Sicilian Defence? In general, if he has the ...e6/ ... d6 centre, Black is in a re markable lack of hurry to take on more space. At most he will play ...b5, and if White stops that by playing a4 it is hardly a matter of great concern. But look at White's various strategies against the Sicilian. It seems practically man datory to expand his reach over the board. Re cently there are players who set up with f3, g4, g5 and h4 (and even h5 and g6) against the ma jority of Sicilian variations. Traditionally, f4 has been a standard way of proceeding, with f5 to follow or perhaps e5 (although the latter is sometimes more of a tactical device, because the pawn will seldom stay on e5 long enough to be a true claimant of territory). These days there are also more combinations of f4 and g4. Barring those kingside moves, White will at least play a4 to stake out some space on the queenside. In the Maroczy Bind and Hedgehog Variations, in which White already has control of space with pawns on c4 and e4, Black finds it a little more urgent to achieve ...b5 or ... d5, or at least threaten to do so. Almost every opening can be looked at_ in this way, that is, how vital is it for the side with less space (usually Black) to win space, and how quickly? What about the need for White to take on more space quickly, or can he be pa tient? If you understand the urgency (or lack of it) in achieving these goals, you will have a much better feel for the logic and timing behind the opening moves. Cross-Pol I ination Sometimes manoeuvres and positional ideas will arise across openings that are not specifi cally related, a phenomenon that I call 'cross pollination' . We have seen repeated examples of structures that show up in various openings, and in a way everything that we've seen about structures to this point has involved cross pollination, that is, every structure has been re lated to other structures. Here I'll briefly discuss the process that may lead you to recognize such similarities and therefore play an unfamiliar or only partly familiar variation with increased confidence. Grandmasters are very good at see ing this type of relationship in subtle ways. You'll gain a lot from the very process of using your study and experience from one position and then applying it to another. All the more reason to keep your opening knowledge broad and not overspecialized. As an example, you've probably wondered whether to play with an isolated queen's pawn in a given position. This requires judgements based upon experience. We already know that the isolated pawn offers similar lessons across a wide range of openings. We even see standard IQP positions that are essentially the same in the Nimzo-Indian, Caro-Kann, Sicilian and Queen's Gambit. But you'll consistently be given the option of deciding whether a new IQP position in a foreign position has more good features than defects, and experience with other open ings will do more than an author's generalities can. A more interesting illustration of cross pollination relates to decisions about when to
THE SIGNIFICANCE OF STRUCTURE 83
bring your queen out, and whether you can do so productively at an early stage. If, as Black, you've captured some 'poisoned' pawns on b2 or gambited them as White, you'll certainly get a better feel for when to take the risk in either way. Here are a few examples that you might run into:

If you get a new position in which you are being offered a b-pawn in the opening, you can make a better decision by studying these. Another question: when do you want to al low your queen to come out with the move . . .�xd5 or �xd4 within the first few moves of the game? What about that rule that says the queen shouldn't come out too early? Maybe as a beginner you have seen or read about the Dan ish Gambit line 1 e4 e5 2 d4 exd4 3 c3 d5 4 exd5 �xd5. The c3-square is temporarily occupied and thus there's time for Black to develop be fore his queen is attacked; for instance, 5 cxd4 lllc6 6 fllf3 J.g4 7 J.e2 lll f6 8 lll c3 J.b4 (this position also arises in the Goring Gambit) and Black has equality. Later you see similar ideas in the Sicilian Defence, where we have 1 e4 c5
2 c3 d5 3 exd5 �xd5 and c3 is occupied so that
White can't place a knight there with tempo; of ten 4 d4 lllf6 5 lllf3 J.g4 will follow. Perhaps the improving student will start to examine the c3-square as one strong criterion in deciding whether to play ... d5 and/or recapture with the queen on that square. From White's point of view we have such things as 1 c4 e5 2 g3 lllf6 3 J.g2 c6 4 d4 cxd4 5 �xd4. Say that you're playing the French Defence and start out 1 e4 e6 2 d4 d5 3 llld2 lllc6, re cently a hot variation. Maybe you have some recent analysis on 4 lllgf3 and 4 J.b5 that you want to try out. When your opponent plays 4 c3, you don't recognize the move, but search your pattern database and come up with 4 ...e5 ! 5 exd5 �xd5. Pattern recognition could also be involved if you play the Pirc Defence and are confronted with 1 e4 d6 2 d4 lllf6 3 J.d3. Playing 3 ... e5 is fairly obvious, and then White plays 4 c3. What now? If you're attuned to the way that a pawn on c3 prevents lll c3, you might see 4 ...d5 ! , with the idea 5 exd5 �xd5 or 5 dxe5 lllxe4 (D). This looks fun and worth a try. But then you notice 6 J.xe4 dxe4 7 �a4+ followed by �xe4, shake your head, and play some other 4th move. This is where the stock of familiar positions comes in. Two weeks later you happen to notice a grandmaster in this position as Black and after a short think he plays 4 ... d5 anyway. There follows 5 dxe5 lllxe4 6 J.xe4 dxe4 7 �a4+ J.d7 ! 8 �xe4 J.c6 ( D) with plenty of compensation (two bishops, light squares, and direct attack on g2). Our grandmaster didn't give up on the line after he saw 7 �a4+; was this due to seeing fur ther than the club player? Probably not, because just about every grandmaster and international master has seen this kind of sequence before. For example, there are a couple of classic games

The broader your exposure to typical structures, the better you'll be able to handle unfamiliar situations. See Chapter 14 on the Pirc Defence for more details about this varia tion; the next thing that happens is that it turns into an Open Variation of the Ruy Lopez! Along the same lines (bringing queens to d4 or d5), a tricky anti-Sicilian variation goes 1 e4 c5 2 lllf3 d6 3 c3 lllf6 4 ii.d3 ! ? lllc6, when some players may not want to face ... ii.g4, so they play 5 h3.

With experience in any of those, you may be helped by recognition of associated patterns such as 8 ... lll f6 9 lll xh7 (9 ii.xh7 lllxh7 10 Vi'h5+ 'it>d7 1 1 lllxh7 'it>c7, etc.) 9 ... l!Vd6 (or maybe 9 ... lllxh7 10 Vi'h5+ 'it>d7 1 1 il.xh7 b6, even if you haven't seen that one before). The fact that you've seen and/or played other posi tions with the e6 move helps you to make more accurate calculations and gives you confidence that the resulting positions should be fine for Black. There are plenty of other cases of an early 'it'xd4 (or ... l!Vxd5) in which the c3-square (or c6-square for Black) isn't occupied. The sim plest of these is the Scandinavian Defence (Centre Counter) 1 e4 d5 2 exd5 l!Vxd5, when 3 lll c3 forces the loss of a tempo with the queen, still out early and subject to further attack. I think that it's fair to say that the reason that Black can get away with this is that the knight isn't all that well placed on c3, such that Black can play moves like ... ii.f5, ... e6 and ... c6 at some point, when White would prefer to have his c-pawn free to advance and increase his central control. Or the queen, when attacked, may use the tempo 'lost' to make a second pro ductive move. A good example comes up in the line 1 c4 e5 2 g3 lllf6 3 lt:Jf3 e4 4 lt:Jd4 lllc6 5 lllc2 d5 6 cxd5 Vi'xd5 7 lllc3 Vi'h5 ! intending ... ii.h3, when Black has an excellent game. That leads to many other examples, such as those in which a knight on c3 (or ... c6) is pinned, so that a queen can come to d4 (or d5). A well known case is the Nimzo-Indian line with 1 d4 lllf6 2 c4 e6 3 lllc3 ii.b4 4 l!Vc2 d5 5 cxd5 Vi'xd5; and a related one is the Chigorin De fence with 1 d4 d5 2 c4 lllc6 3 cxd5 l!Vxd5 4 e3 e5 5 lllc3 ii.b4. From the white side, we have a Sicilian Defence with 1 e4 c5 2 lllf3 d6 3 d4 cxd4 4 Vi'xd4 lllc6 5 il.b5, which we might compare with a Philidor Defence 1 e4 e5 2 lt:Jf3 d6 3 d4 exd4 4 l!Vxd4 lllc6 5 ii.b5. In both cases the queen is allowed to stand her ground, but often at the cost of the bishop-pair. Do you spot the main difference? In the Sicilian line, Black keeps his central majority intact; in the Philidor Black surrenders the centre. After a while it be comes second nature to look for these situa tions, and advanced players do so. Cross-pollination between 1 d4 and 1 e4 is more common than you'd think. The chess player with some experience may have noticed that the Benoni pawn-chain ...c5/. ..d6 versus White's e4/d5 will often arise in the King's In dian Defence, after, for instance, 1 d4 lllf6 2 c4 g6 3 lll c3 ii.g7 4 e4 d6 5 ii.e2 O-O 6 ii.g5 c5 7 d5 h6 8 ii.e3 e6 9 lllf3 exd5 10 cxd5 and in several other major lines. But if you're playing the black side of a Ruy Lopez, you might consider heading for this same structure by way of vari ous Closed lines. For example, in the Keres Variation you may arrive at this main position:
1 e4 e5 2 lllf3 lllc6 3 ii.b5 a6 4 ii.a4 lllf6 5 O-O
ii.e7 6 .l':tel b5 7 �b3 O-O 8 c3 d6 9 h3 lt:Ja5 10 ii.c2 c5 1 1 d4 llld7 ! ? 12 lllbd2 exd4 1 3 cxd4 lllc6 14 d5 lllce5 (D). The Benoni structure has arisen and you al ready have the move ... b5 in. That's the key move in nearly every Benoni and very often
THE SIGNIFICANCE OF STRUCTURE 85
White will prevent it. All Black needs to do next is 'fianchetto' his bishop by ... J.f6 and he will obtain an excellent game. White doesn't want to allow this and plays 15 lllxe5, but as it turns out that frees Black's game or at least gives his pieces places to go. Cross-pollination will appear in contexts that are not strictly structural, but relate to the scope of plausible structures. I think that a lot of this shows up in the opening preparation of players and their borrowing of ideas from each other. Grandmaster X will see a new move that Grand master Y has played on the 1 8th move of a cer tain variation of the Sicilian. Then he may apply that move to his 14th move in a closely-related variation. That is an interesting exchange of ideas, of course, but it's more exciting to see players latch on to the same moves or general ideas across the range of openings. The number of older, well-known, positions in which White has recently found and played the move g4 can not be coincidental. Whole articles have been written about this move appearing in so many new and interesting contexts. The list of open ings thus affected includes several variations of the English Opening, the Semi-Slav, the Two Knights Defence, the Bogo-Indian Defence, the Dutch Defence, the Caro-Kann Defence, and just about every variation of the Sicilian De fence! And I could make a similar although shorter list of openings in which Black has be gun to use the move ... g5. Obviously, once the idea struck players' imaginations they began to look for it in every position. Something that has struck me about chess from the last several decades, actually stretch ing back more than a century but only recently flowering, is the phenomenon of semi-waiting moves in the opening. That is, moves that serve a definite purpose but only just so, and which seem to need the opponent' s cooperation to take on meaning. It is fascinating to see, how ever, that these moves are a little more effective than my description would imply, i.e. the oppo nent hasn't really the luxury of doing nothing in return without giving ground. A lot of these ideas are unassuming; for example, develop ment of pieces to the second rank that appear to have five good answers and yet are hard to meet. Or a sequence of moves that seems to lose a tempo but puts the opponent' s pieces somewhere they' d rather not be; for instance, in d-pawn and c-pawn openings with an early ...e6 we see many new cases of ... i.b4+ followed by ... J.e7, and ... J.a6 followed by ... J.b7. In the Sicilian Defence and English Opening, Black always seems to be playing ... J.c5 or ... i.b4 followed by ... i.e7. I find the little rook's pawn moves to be par ticularly thought-provoking, and I suspect that grandmasters are finding inspiration from such moves' success in some openings to experiment with them in others. These are not necessarily new moves but often obscure older ones which later received general acceptance. For instance, Kasparov's strengthening of Petrosian's little move 1 d4 lllf6 2 c4 e6 3 lllf3 b6 4 a3 ! ? led to an explosion of games and investigations, and 4 a3 has been going strong in the Queen's Indian Defence for many years now. Variations such as
1 c4 c5 2 lll
f3 lllf6 3 d4 cxd4 4 lllxd4 lll c6 5 lll c3 e6 6 a3 ! ? began to appear. Then some years later players got serious about the mod est-looking ...a6 within the first four moves in two variations of the Slav: 1 d4 d5 2 c4 c6 3 lllf3 lll f6 and here 4 e3 a6 or 4 lllc3 a6. Not only that, these two moves have now accumu lated analysis and playing experience that rival the main lines of some openings! In that case, Black wants to play ...b5 to gain space, or cap ture on c4 and then play ... b5. He may also want to play his bishop out to g4 or f5 and not worry about �b3, answering that move with .. J1a7 in some variations! Another example: the varia tions with 4 ...a6 in the Modem Defence are a little insulting to the classical thinker, but re freshing; e.g., I e4 g6 2 d4 J.g7 3 fllc3 d6 and now 4 i.e3 a6, 4 f4 a6, 4 fllf3 a6 or 4 J.g5 a6,
86 MASTERING THE CHESS OPENINGS
and so forth. These all seem fully playable, in part because ...c5 can follow and 'threaten' to go into a favourable Sicilian Defence, an ex ample of cross-pollination. Recently players started looking at long-established openings and found a new idea or rediscovered it in older literature; for instance, 1 e4 e5 2 lbf3 lbc6 3 lllc3 lllf6 4 a3 ! ?. This is another waiting move that doesn't do much but achieves a little some thing; for example, 4 ... ii.c5 5 lll xe5 ! , when the resource ... ii.b4 isn't available after 5 ... lllxe5 6 d4. Or in the Pirc Defence, the remarkable 1 e4 d6 2 d4 lllf6 3 lllc3 g6 4 f4 ii.g7 5 a3 !?, prevent ing the usual 5 ...c5 in view of 6 dxc5 l!Va5 7 b4, and otherwise waiting for Black to make a com mittal move, of which it turns out that many have disadvantages. In the Sicilian Defence, 1 e4 c5 2 lll f3 lllc6 3 d4 cxd4 4 lll xd4 lllf6 5 lllc3 e6 became a popular way to avoid major Sicil ian theory; after a century of experience with that line players noticed the possibility of 6 a3, preventing 6 ... ii.b4 and again waiting to see what Black is going to do. There's a current in terest in 1 e4 c5 2 a3 (not to mention 2 llla3 ! ?), and even a monograph devoted to it. Similar things have been going on with Black. In the French Defence with 1 e4 e6 2 d4 d5 3 lllc3 (and 3 llld2), grandmasters have been using 3 ...h6 (the other rook' s pawn!), asking White to commit while preventing il.g5 and finding the move ...g5 useful in a remarkable number of positions. Likewise, Anand and many others have played 1 c4 e5 2 g3 lllf6 3 ii.g2 h6. It seems obvious that these sorts of ideas feed off each other, with each new explorer inspired by the most recent discoveries. But if you look at the details of the newly discovered theory and practice of such lines, you will see that standard structures from other chess openings appear everywhere throughout them. In other words, experiments like these are successful only be cause of the vast knowledge of traditional open ings that lets players find old patterns in new contexts. The moral of the story is not to play the move a3 in every position (or any position!), but to realize that mastery of openings comes from a broader set of structures and techniques that ap pear across the board. While you study the tra ditional openings, be sure to look at ideas from every other source to reinforce what you're learning. Furthermore, you can look at structural themes in the same way, comparing them from opening to opening. The more that you examine and compare outposts and support-points, for example, the more you will find yourself able to work with them. Ask simple questions when you play over games by grandmasters: when are outposts on squares like e5, d5, e4 and d4 similar, and how do they differ? Does the out post piece radiate influence and make counter play fruitless? Can the outpost be maintained? Can a piece on the outpost be exchanged off fa vourably in order to change the pawn-structure? Is there a situation in which the outpost can be 'played around' , leaving an impressive-looking but uninvolved piece occupying it? Similarly, is a piece on an outpost in front of doubled or backward pawns so powerful that it's worth a rook, or will it just sit there and block one's own play? Either result is possible. Cross-pollination turns out to be an unlimited subject and contributes to the fact that we take so strong an interest in chess. There are examples throughout this book and in most sources of chess information. Keep an eye out for them, es pecially as you study and play openings. You'll find it a fun exercise, and helpful for your chess.
4 Introduction to 1 e4 and the Open
Games Want to play a game of chess? I'll move first:
1 e4 (D)
Advancing the e-pawn two squares is the old est and still the most popular way to begin the game. Beginners who know little more than the rules proudly play 1 e4 before they start losing their pieces. Chess in the movies is dominated by e-pawn play. The majority of the world's top ten players use 1 e4 more often than not. What's so great about this move? On the most basic level, 1 e4 fights for control of the key central square d5, and it frees the fl-bishop to join the fray. Indeed, in the 1 e4 e5 openings that dominated chess practice for so many years, we find the bishop being developed at an early stage. Surprisingly, however, that doesn't hold true for most of Black's other defences to 1 e4. What other advantages stand forth? Well, mov ing the e-pawn also opens up the d l -h5 diago nal for White's queen to come out on, although she doesn't use that privilege much in the early stages, so as not to become an object of attack. White's queen does prevent or discourage cer tain uncommon deployments of Black's pieces and pawns, such as rash advances involving .. .f6 or .. .f5. These are not exactly compelling reasons for
1 e4 to have ascended to the throne of the open
ings realm. Maybe we should think on an even more fundamental level. What's the first goal of opening play? To control the centre. And what's the best way to do that? To set up an ideal cen tre. There are only two moves involved in that project: e4 and d4. To some extent, playing the one creates the threat to play the other. Thus, playing one of these two moves right away nar rows Black's set of logical responses and in some sense establishes a degree of control. At that point there are various advantages to either move, and indeed 1 d4 is White's second most popular opening move by a landslide. The over all preference for 1 e4 then comes down to more subtle factors, and I may as well cite the obvious fact that in the great majority of open ings, 1 e4 prepares the way for kingside cas tling more quickly than does 1 d4. Now things get a little more complicated. Notice that the e4-pawn is undefended. Not surprisingly, Black will often attack it and try to compel White to spend a move protecting his pawn. This immediate vulnerability is not shared by other popular first moves by White such as 1 d4, 1 c4, or 1 lllf3. Hence Breyer's proclamation that 'After 1 e4, White's game is in its last throes' ! That is melodramatic, of course, but it does reflect the direction in which Black's defences will tend to go. He will gener ally create threats to White's e-pawn, usually by the move ... lllf6 or by ... d5. We find such an attack on White's e4-pawn in most of the major defences to 1 e4, usually within the first two or three moves of the game. For example: a) The Caro-Kann: 1 e4 c6 2 d4 d5; b) The Alekhine: 1 e4 lll f6; c) The Petroff: 1 e4 e5 2 fllf3 lll f6; d) The French: 1 e4 e6 2 d4 d5 (and 3 lll c3 lll f6 or 3 llld2 lll j6, among other examples);
88 MASTERING THE CHESS OPENINGS
e) The Scandinavian: 1 e4 d5; f) The Pirc: 1 e4 d6 2 d4 t:fJ/6. After 1 e4 e5 much the same holds; for ex ample, 2 f4 exf4 3 t:fJf3 d5 (or 3 ... t:fJ/6). Or, after
1 e4 e5 2 t:fJf3 t:fJc6, we have 3 ii.c4 l:iJf6, 3 ii.b5
t:fJ/6 and many other Ruy Lopez positions with ... t:fJf6 at a very early stage. An exception to all this is the Sicilian De fence: after 1 e4 c5, Black's move ... d5 is nor mally inferior and in the main lines he doesn't usually get to play ... t:fJf6 until the 4th or 5th move (e.g., 2 t:fJf3 d6 3 d4 cxd4 4 t:fJxd4 t:fJf6), or perhaps later (after 2 t:fJf3 e6 3 d4 cxd4 4 t:fJxd4 t:fJc6 5 t:fJc3 a6 6 ii.e2 'W/c7 7 O-O t:fJf6, for exam ple). Nevertheless, attack on White's e4-pawn is a consistent theme of Black's strategy in these Sicilian variations; he very often follows ... t:fJf6 with moves such as ... ii.b7, ... t:fJbd7-c5 and the like. Finally, one of White's principal alternatives to 1 e4 c5 2 t:fJf3 is 1 e4 c5 2 c3, to which Black normally replies 2 ... d5 or 2 ... t:fJf6, both attacking e4. This observation may seem trivial, but in how many queen's pawn openings (i.e., those stemming from 1 d4) does Black attack the d4- pawn at all? Certainly not early on in openings like the following: a) The Queen's Gambit Declined: 1 d4 d5 2 c4 e6 and, for example, 3 t:fJc3 t:fJf6 4 il.g5 ii.e7
5 e3 O-O, etc.;
b) The Nimzo-Indian: 1 d4 t:fJf6 2 c4 e6 3 t:fJc3 ii.b4; c) The major Indian defences that begin with I ...t:fJf6 and 2 ... e6 or 2 ...g6, with the exception of the Benoni ( 1 d4 t:fJf6 2 c4 c5). This is not universally the case, but for the most part it holds true. After 1 t:fJf3, of course, White's knight is ex empt from direct attack by Black; in practical terms, so is White's pawn after 1 c4. We there fore have a fundamental difference between 1 e4 and other first moves. The Open Games It is interesting that 1 e4 is commonly thought to be an 'attacking' move. To some extent that derives from the very exposure of the e4-pawn to attack, which can lead to early confrontation and the kind of dynamism often associated with king's pawn openings. But the characterization of 1 e4 as an 'attacking' opening, and of 1 d4 as a 'positional' opening doesn't really follow. The openings arising from 1 e4 e5 are called the 'Open Games' because pieces tend to come out rapidly and at least part of the pawn-centre tends to evaporate. In particular, the association of 1 e4 with aggressive play stems in large part from the tradition of tactically-based annihila tions that spring from 1 e4 e5. Openings deriv ing from 1 e4 e5 (D) are also combative from at least one perspective, namely that even within the first few moves the players so often make threats to pawns, pieces, or even the king. We can see this reputation illustrated by nu merous standard variations. The move 2 t:fJf3 immediately threatens the e-pawn, and after 2 ... t:fJc6 3 ii.c4 t:fJf6, 4 t:fJg5 already attacks the king! Such things don't happen after 1 d4 d5. It might be useful to look at some of the more traditional openings after 1 e4 e5. We have 2 f4 (the King's Gambit, an opening ubiquitous in master chess of the 1 9th century). After 2 ...exf4 White tries to attack the king down the f-file in conjunction with ii.c4, t:fJf3 and O-O. 2 d4 is an other way to attack the pawn, and after 2 ...exd4 3 c3, White is already trying to blast open the centre with tempo (after 3 ...dxc3, 4 ii.c4!? cxb2 5 il.xb2 is the Danish Gambit, and 4 t:fJxc3 is the Goring Gambit). The Vienna Game with 2 t:fJc3 t:fJf6 3 ii.c4 t:fJxe4 4 l!Vh5 has all the ele ments of attacking chess. Even the generally calm Giuoco Piano main line, 2 t:fJf3 t:fJc6 3 i.c4 ii.c5 4 c3 (don't forget 4 b4, the Evans Gambit) 4 ... t:fJf6 5 d4 exd4 6 cxd4 ii.b4+, can result in violent play after 7 t:fJc3 !? t:fJxe4 8 O-O ii.xc3 9 d5 and similar variations. There are
INTRODUCTION TO I e4 AND THE OPEN GAMES 89
plenty of other examples such as the wild Max Lange with 2 lll f3 lll c6 3 i.c4 lll f6 4 d4 exd4 5 O-O and after 5 ... i.c5 6 e5 (a typical advance; see below) 6 ...d5 7 exf6 dxc4 8 l:Iel + i.e6 9 lbg5 �d5 1 0 lll c3 or 5 ... lllxe4 6 .l:tel d5 7 i.xd5 �xd5 8 lll c3 there are things being at tacked all over the place! In all of these examples the centre opens up quickly with short-term tactical consequences. So isn't it clear that the Open Games are domi nated by attacking chess? There's something missing from this argument; you could make it in the year 1900 but not today. In contemporary chess, most of the above variations are rarely seen (although they are instructive and worth experimenting with), partly because the quality of dynamism can easily peter out when accom panied by too many exchanges. In fact, all of them put together aren't played nearly as often as the Ruy Lopez ( 1 e4 e5 2 lll f3 lll c6 3 i.b5). That is significant because in the most impor- tant variations of the Ruy Lopez it frequently occurs that not a single pawn is exchanged until well into the middlegame, nor do the pieces get near each other if they can help it. Looked at from that perspective, the king of e-pawn open ings doesn't act like an Open Game at all ! To be sure, the variations described in this manner are 'Closed' Ruy Lopez systems and do not encom pass the entire opening. Nevertheless, in most games with the Ruy Lopez the dynamic action is delayed until after some serious manoeuv ring has occurred, a type of play that becomes increasingly fascinating as you become a better player. A similar statement can be made about the Petroff Defence ( 1 e4 e5 2 lllf3 lll f6), the next most popular 1 e4 e5 opening at the inter national level. The Petroff shouldn't be de scribed as non-confrontational, but it tends to lead to fairly stable half-open structures in which tactics play a lesser role. The Giuoco Piano ( 1 e4 e5 2 lll f3 lll c6 3 i.c4 i.c5) and the Scotch Game are examples of double e-pawn openings that can produce either tactical or positional struggles. I think that it's fair to characterize 1 e4 e5 as neither exceptionally dynamic nor se date. It might be argued, in fact, that the Open Si cilian ( 1 e4 c5 2 lllf3 with 3 d4) has inherited the mantle from double e-pawn openings in producing romantic attacking chess. Not with disappearing centres, to be sure - the centre is remarkably stable in most Sicilian variations when you consider what's going on around it but in the exuberant activity of the pieces. White' s energetic knights on c3 and d4 are of ten complemented by bishops on g5, e3, d3 and/or c4; his queen goes to d2, e2 or f3; his rooks to central files, and his pawns rush for ward to attack from squares such as f4, f5, g4, g5, h4, h5, etc.
1 e4 versus 1 d4
So which is objectively better, 1 e4 or 1 d4? The short answer is that it depends upon the prefer ences of the individual player. To go any fur ther, we should address the state of theory. Many of us will remember that for some time 1 d4 was Garry Kasparov's main opening move, played in order to generate attacks. Indeed, a significant portion of his most brilliant and ag gressive games begin with 1 d4. Attackers like Shirov also used d-pawn openings, as did a younger and more aggressive Kramnik. Korch noi rarely deviates from his adherence to 1 d4/1 c4 openings and of course many other top-level grandmasters use 1 d4 almost exclusively. Nev ertheless, at this moment we see a distinct pref erence for 1 e4 among most of the world's strongest grandmasters. Is that because 1 d4 isn't an exciting move? Would you say that the Exchange Variation of the Griinfeld, the Bot vinnik Variation of the Semi-Slav, the Exchange Variation of the Queen's Gambit Declined, the Taimanov Variation of the Benoni, and any number of King's Indian lines, are not aggres sive attacking systems? In reality, what happens is that in different eras, individual defences prove to be temporary barriers to the general use of 1 e4 or 1 d4 at the very highest levels. At this moment in time I would say that the Nimzo-Indian ( 1 d4 lllf6 2 c4 e6 3 lll c3 i.b4) is such a defence, with Black complementing its use with the Queen's Indian Defence or Queen's Gambit Declined when confronted by 3 lllf3. Recently, however, White has done reasonably well against the Queen's Indian and it has tradi tionally been possible to create chances against the Queen's Gambit. Furthermore, White's score against the Nimzo-Indian is somewhat better than his score against other openings,
90 MASTERING THE CHESS OPENINGS
including those beginning with 1 e4. In the Ruy Lopez, on the other hand, we currently see White avoiding the Marshall Attack with, for example, an early h3 followed by moves such as d3, a3, lll c3 and ii.a2 (see Chapter 8). Given the unambitious appearance of this method of play (although it's faring tolerably well so far), one wonders if the pendulum might swing back to 1 d4. Or perhaps players will amend their tastes some years hence, for unrelated reasons. That is part of the fun of following opening the ory. At any rate, the average player (and even 'ordinary' master) need not worry about such matters; either first move will produce games with plenty of opportunities for victory. Don't worry if the recital of names in the last few paragraphs befuddles you. My point is to present 1 e4 from a broad perspective. It can be as much an option for positional players as for attacking players. There are ways to fight for very small and lasting advantages against nearly every defence to 1 e4, and there are ways to try to decimate the opponent with slash-and-bum tactics. Most of the latter methods come up short of their goal against proper defence, or in the face of counterattack by Black. Still, once the smoke has cleared, a bold attack may be just as effective as any other approach at producing a small but durable advantage. Rather than measuring degrees of aggres sion, a dispassionate investigation of e-pawn openings turns up a more interesting distinction between 1 e4 and 1 d4. This has to do with the acquisition of space by the pawn advance e5, which is prominent in the Semi-Open Garnes (defences other than 1 .. .e5), but can also occur in double e-pawn openings. Consider that White can play e5 on the third move of both the Caro Kann Defence ( 1 e4 c6 2 d4 d5 3 e5) and French Defence ( l e4 e6 2 d4 d5 3 e5), and on the sec ond move of the Alekhine Defence ( 1 e4 lllf6 2 e5). Against the Pirc Defence, e5 is a common move in the variation 1 e4 d6 2 d4 lllf6 3 lll c3 g6 4 f4, and played in several lines with 4 lll f3 and 4 ii.c4. Just a bit further on in French De fence games, we have 1 e4 e6 2 d4 d5 3 lllc3 ii.b4 4 e5, 1 e4 e6 2 d4 d5 3 lll c3 lt:Jf6 4 ii.g5 ii.e7 5 e5, and so forth. After 1 e4 e5, there are moves such as 2 lllf3 lllc6 3 ii.c4 lllf6 4 d4 exd4 5 e5, or the more complex 2 lllf3 lllc6 3 d4 exd4 4 lll xd4 lZ:lf6 5 lllxc6 bxc6 6 e5, the latter revived and brought into prominence by World Champion Kasparov. Where do you find similar advances in the practice of 1 d4 d5, or in any line beginning with 1 d4? In a d-pawn opening, White seldom plays d5 with a threat within the first six moves. In fact, only in a few openings (such as 1 d4 lllf6 2 c4 c5 3 d5) does the d-pawn even reach the fifth rank, whether there is a threat or not. It's true that d5 will fairly often occur in the King's Indian Defence (e.g., 1 d4 lllf6 2 c4 g6 3 lllc3 ii.g7 4 e4 d6 5 lllf3 O-O 6 ii.el e5 and now
7 d5 or 7 O-O lllc6 8 d5); and similarly in a few
lines of the Griinfeld. However, such d5 ad vances don't occur often after 1 d4 d5 and will usually happen well past the first several moves of the opening. In e-pawn openings, an analo gous situation would be the advance d5 in the Ruy Lopez, normally played after the 10th move. What does that mean? That by using 1 e4, at least in some openings, White has the option of staking out a significant space advantage early on. This is indeed an aggressive stance, but not one that involves open centres and multiple ex changes - quite the contrary. And keep in mind that when pawns are advanced they can become vulnerable; again we hark back to Breyer's 'last throes' . If you are an e-pawn player, you have to take that possibility into account when you advance your pawns. Failure to tie your oppo nent down or make other difficulties for him can sometimes leave you on the defensive. On the other hand, an aggressive pawn presence in the enemy camp can reward you with a winning advantage. You will see examples of both of these results throughout the book.
5 G iuoco Piano
1 e4 e5 2 tbf3 tbc6 3 J.c4 (D)
The move 3 J.c4 has been used consistently since the early days of chess in its modem form. Although far behind the Ruy Lopez (3 J.b5) in popularity, 3 J.c4 is White's second favourite continuation. Placing the bishop on c4 agrees with the principles of development and central ization, and prepares to castle quickly. It is also the move that most directly attacks Black's po sition, in particular the sensitive f7-square. In addition, White wants to control the central d5-square and thus prevent Black's freeing move . . .d5. In this respect 3 .ltc4 fulfils a positive po sitional role that, for instance, 3 J.e2 doesn't. As always, there are drawbacks, not obvious at first. Because the bishop on c4 makes no threat, Black himself is able to develop freely. That would also seem to be true of 3 .ltb5, which also has no direct threat; but the latter move discourages a number of black set-ups that .ltc4 doesn't, by virtue of the potential threat of .ltxc6 and tbxe5. In the Giuoco Piano, moreover, we shall see that if Black does achieve the move ... d5, White may lose a tempo or suffer some positional disadvantage. These considerations are rather abstract, and can only be shown by example. I should mention that the Bishop's Open ing, l e4 e5 2 J.c4, is a respectable choice that will sometimes transpose to 3 J.c4, for in stance after 2 ... J.c5 3 tbf3 tbc6. The inde pendent line 2 J.c4 tbf6 3 d3 c6 4 tbf3 d5 5 J.b3 J.d6 can lead to complex play, and of course Black can play ... tbc6 on one of the first few moves. One of the problems with 2 J.c4 is that Black has various ways to control the direction of play. That interferes with some players' desire to be in command as White, particularly when facing a symmetri cal variation such as l ...e5. 3 ... J.c5 (D) This development of Black's bishop is the oldest well-analysed response to 3 .ltc4. I'll use the generally accepted name 'Giuoco Piano' for 3 ... J.c5; it is also called 'the Italian Game' in recognition of the Italian players who published analysis of the move in the late 16th and early 17th centuries. With 3 ... J.c5, Black attends to White's move d4, the idea of which is to form an ideal centre. Moreover, the move tbg5 is lurking in the back ground; since that would attack the f7-square twice, Black wants to be ready to defend against the threat by castling. The straightforward posi tion after 3 ... J.c5 contains a majority of the ba sic classical ideas about development, centre and attack. That should motivate us to examine it in some depth.
92 MASTERING THE CHESS OPENINGS
4 c3 I shall concentrate upon this continuation as representing the purest intent of the opening: to establish an ideal centre and drive Black's pieces away with tempo. 4 c3 leads to play that resembles other openings and is therefore of general value. For organizational reasons, the line 4 d3 tllf6 is discussed in Chapter 6 about the Two Knights Defence. It will arise via the move-order 1 e4 eS 2 tllf3 tllc6 3 .ltc4 tllf6 4 d3 .lies. The similar 4 c3 tllf6 S d3 is placed at the end of this chapter.
4...tll
f6 With this move Black develops a piece and counterattacks. Other moves allow White to ex ecute his plan; for example, the line 4 ...d6? ! S d4 exd4 6 cxd4 .ltb4+ (D) illustrates White's central superiority. Then White has several good continuations: a) 7 @fl !? (this is the fancy way to get out of check; White threatens 8 dS, and when the knight moves, 9 �a4+ picks up the bishop) 7 ....ltaS 8 dS tt:lce7 9 b4 ! (9 �a4+ c6 protects the aS-bishop) 9 ... .ltb6 10 .ltb2 and the bishops are dominating the board. One can compare the Evans Gambit ( 1 e4 eS 2 tll f3 tt:lc6 3 .Jlc4 .lies
4 b4 .ltxb4 S c3), in which something like this
can arise but with Black having an extra pawn by way of compensation. b) Naturally 7 tt:lc3, developing a piece, can't be bad: 7 ... tllf6 8 dS .ltxc3+ (again, watch out for 8 ... tt:le7?? 9 �a4+, winning a piece; this is a common trick in many openings, including those stemming from 1 d4) 9 bxc3. The result ing position favours White because of his dom inating centre. c) 7 .lid2 .ltxd2+ 8 �xd2 gives White supe rior development in terms of quantity and qual ity. We now return to 4 ... tllf6 (D): 5 d4 Certainly the most challenging continuation. A less aggressive but also interesting alterna tive is S d3. I'll discuss that more technical move at the end of the chapter. White has the instructive option of playing S O-O, when Black does best to capture by

From White's point of view, this endgame is at best equal, and more likely he will end up with a somewhat inferior posi tion. 5 ... exd4 6 cxd4 The seemingly assertive 6 eS can again be answered by 6 ...dS ! (6 ...tt:le4?!, with 7 �e2 dS 8 exd6 O-O in mind, is strongly answered by 7 .lidS) 7 .libs (7 exf6? dxc4 8 fxg7 :Ig8 leaves all of Black's pieces active and ready to spring into action, whereas White is underdeveloped and losing badly in the centre; Black will cas tle queenside in order to safeguard his king) 7 ...tt:le4 8 cxd4. Now Black can play either 8 ....ltb4+ or, more commonly, 8 ....ltb6. In the latter case play might go 9 O-O O-O 10 .ltxc6?!

Notice the combination of 1 3 ... c5 and 17. ..c5. This double-hammer with the c-pawns with the intent to destroy White's centre is a common theme. White should take that possibility into account when playing .ltxc6.

This line is unresolved; many players will not trust it because Black's king comes to the centre, and others will embrace its adventurous char acter.

If this hadn't been a simulta neous exhibition (as opposed to a serious tour nament game), Kluxen's name would have gone down in history for beating the mighty Capa blanca! As it stands, the game shows the appeal of the Open Games. b) The other alternative with a durable char acter is 10 �c2; for example, 10 ... tt:lce7 (if

So White has more than one way to maintain active play on the board. Now let's return to 10 �b3 (D): This venerable position is characterized by a balance of classic positional factors: White's greater activity and space, including pressure down the c- and e-files, versus Black's firm blockade of a potentially weak isolated pawn on d4. In Chapter 3, I discuss numerous other isolated queen's pawns in chess openings. How does this IQP compare with those? As always, Black's blockade of d5 is a key element in his attempt to keep the position under control. In the position before us, White can't break the blockade but can 'play around' that knight to create threats. The exchange of dark-squared bishops should favour Black, because simplifi cation makes it harder for White to muster forces for an attack. This raises the interesting question of what degree of simplification tends to negate the more active party's compensation for his isolated pawn weakness. In this particular situation White still has significant resources, as we shall see. Although some further exchanges will seriously cut into his chances, others can in crease his pressure! It all depends upon piece play. For instance, isolated queen's pawn posi tions from other openings like the Queen's Gambit Accepted, Nirnzo-Indian, Caro-Kann, etc., allow Black options of expanding on the queenside by ...a6 and ... b5 or fianchettoing with . .. b6 and ....ltb7. That sort of thing doesn't apply to our current variation, nor does Black appear to have a way to disturb the equilibrium. If that's true, Black may have to leave his opponent alone for a while, giving White crucial time to try to improve his position. On the other hand, Black has no weaknesses to attack and will only permit a weakness to be created if he can gain something in return. After 10 �b3, Black has two basic plans: re inforcing his blockade by 10. .. tt:lce7, or trying to force events by 10. .. tt:la5. We'll examine both. Blockading the Pawn .•. tt:lce7 (D)

In this situation, the battle between piece activity and positional factors revolves specif ically around the isolated pawn and its block ader. Some samples of the play follow. O'Kelly - Euwe Amsterdam 1950

fel O-O Black has shored up d5 with no obvious dif ficulties. However, White has energetic minor pieces and can create significant problems. First, he stakes out some territory. 13 a4 Gaining space is often the best policy when there are no direct targets. White operates against ...b5, but also plans a5, serving the dou ble function of preparing an attack on b7 and keeping a knight from b6. The other strategy is to emphasize piece-play, for instance by 1 3 lLie4. White can also develop immediately by 1 3 l::t ac 1, as he has done in a few games; for ex - ample, 13 . . .a5 !?

iVb6! Euwe's continuation is probably the most logical response. Simplification should help the defender and Black avoids weaknesses as well. The irritating effect of the pawn-push a5 shows up in the beautiful game Rossolimo-Reissman, Puerto Rico 1 967: 1 3. .. b6 14 ctJe5 .ltb7 15 a5 ! l::t c8?! (15 .. .f6! 16 ctJd3 @h8 is the consistent strategy, guarding d5; Black should use his own strengths) 16 ctJe4 iVc7 17 a6 .lta8 1 8 iVh3 ctJf4 19 iVg4 ctJed5 20 l::t a3 ! . Now Black's king is under serious attack before he has the chance to play ...c5 and free his a8-bishop. The game continued 20 ... ctJe6?

Naturally the brilliance of this move strikes one first (reminiscent of the famous Levitsky Marshall ... iVg3 ! ! game) but an eye for detail will also pick up Black's bishop stuck behind the d5-pawn. That was of course the blockading square which was the pride and joy of Black's position. The game continued 23 ... iVc2 (mate on h7 is threatened, but accepting the queen sacrifice loses instantly: 23 .. .fxg6 24 lLixg6+ hxg6 25 l::t h3#; 23 ... hxg6 24 l::t h3#; or 23 ...gxf6 24 iVxf6+ lLig7 25 l::t g3 l::t g8 26 ctJxf7+) 24 l::t h3 ! 1-0. Either the rook or queen threatens to capture on h7 with checkmate on the next move, but 24 ... iVxg6 25 ctJxg6+ fxg6 26 l::t xh7# is checkmate. Instead of 1 3. .. iVb6 or 13 ...b6, a defence which avoids weakening the queenside and maintains the bishop on the h3-c8 diagonal is 1 3. .. l::t b8; for example, 14 a5 f6! ? (D).

The older lines of the Giuoco Piano can still challenge the chess understanding of both play ers. No other opening serves better as a model for classical double e-pawn chess. Those of lit tle or moderate playing experience will find careful study and practice of this opening par ticularly valuable, and even experienced play ers could do worse than to investigate its unique properties. A Technica l Approach: 5 d3 What if White doesn't want to engage in the kind of open struggle just described? Let's take a look at what happens if he doesn't go in for the relatively forced moves that follow 5 d4 and plays 5 d3 instead:

f3 tllc6 3 .ltc4 .ltc5 4 c3 tllf6 5 d3

This is the kind of slow move that White typ ically makes in order to play it safe and engage Black in a battle of positional skills. His ideas by setting up this structure are: a) to protect his e4-pawn; b) to cover the d4-square against intrusions by Black's pieces (in particular ... tt:ld4); and c) to hold off on the move d4 until his pieces are more developed, thereby avoiding the forc ing variation that we saw in the main variation after 5 d4 exd4 6 cxd4 .ltb4+, which was soon followed by the centre-clearing move ...d5. On the other hand, Black now has much more freedom to develop his pieces. Without

fear of d4 he can do so actively and should se cure equality. But don't expect the play to be easy for either side.

Note that 7 ... tba5 right away would have allowed 8 .ltb5 ! a6 9 i.a4 b5 10 .ltc2, which saves White's bishop from ex change and threatens b4. So we can see another advantage of White's move c3. After the text move, the positional threat of 8 ... tba5 is real, so play can continue as follows: 8 .ltb3 .lta7 9 h3!? (D) Karpov's move. It prevents ... .ltg4 in some situations, but mainly it prepares l:.el without having to worry about ... tbg4. White is now ready to reorganize by moving his knight to c4 and e3, or to play l:.el followed by tbfl , in tum followed by tbg3 or tbe3. Perhaps you're fa miliar with this sequence of moves, but if not, it must look rather odd. In fact, the knight ma noeuvre tbbd2-fl -g3/e3 is standard practice. I won't go into detail at this point, but the princi ple here is that if the centre is stable, players may be able to embark upon long trips with their pieces without being punished. From g3, White's knight lusts after the wonderful square f5 and protects e4; and after tbe3, the knight sets its eyes upon both d5 and f5 (at the cost of blocking off his queen's bishop). We shall see a lot of this manoeuvre tbbd2-fl-g3/e3 in the Ruy Lopez chapter, and it's good to be intro duced to it now. 9 .•. .lte6 9 ...h6 is a good option. You will see a lot of these 'little moves' in variations with d3 and ...d6. The idea is to prevent .ltg5 after White's knight moves. After 10 l:.el , there can follow 10 ... tbh5 !. Compare the game and comments below.

9 ... d5 !? is also playable at this point, al though 10 .l:!.e l is curiously solid for White and asks Black what he's going to do next. 10 .ltc2 d5!? 11 .l:!.el dxe4 Ripperger gives the fascinating line 11.. .d4 12 tt:lc4 dxc3 13 bxc3 .ltxc4 14 dxc4, when White's pawn-structure is thoroughly damaged, but he has the bishop-pair and play down the b and d-files. 12 dxe4 tllh5! (D) This isn't the only move by any means, but it follows a 'mini-rule' that can apply to any opening in which there are pawns on e4 and e5: if White plays h3, the move ... tt:lh5 should be strongly considered. The reasoning is that after ... tt:lf4, the knight can't be kicked out by g3 since ... tt:lxh3 will follow. But if White's bishop captures that knight (i.xf4), he will have ceded the bishop-pair; that is hardly disastrous but usually not a good thing for White (remember how important it is to possess the two bishops). Notice that in the note above about 9 ... h6, the d-file was closed. This time we're about to get an exchange of queens. Of course this sort of technical guidance only fits in certain situations, but it can also ap ply to the Ruy Lopez and Philidor Defences, and the same idea quite frequently occurs in the King's Indian Defence, a very different open ing indeed! 13 tll fl \\Wxdl 14 !Ixdl l:tad8 15 i.e3 f6 16 .ltxa7 tt:lxa7 17 tlle3 tllf4 18 h4 .ltf7 19 tllel At this point Polugaevsky suggests 19 ... tt:le6 20 .ltb3 tt:lc5, which looks equal.
6 Two Knights Defence
1 e4 e5 2 lLif3 lbc6 3 .Jlc4 lLif6 (D)
This is the Two Knights Defence. Its main lines are definitely more ambitious and tactical than those after 3 ... .Jlc5. I shall focus on the two main continuations, 4 lbg5 and 4 d4, and we'll also examine 4 d3 at some length due to its pop ularity and its instructive nature. But first, let's briefly glance at a few rare continuations: a) 4 c3?, as in the Giuoco Piano, is mistimed here due to 4 ... lbxe4 and White won't even get his pawn back without severe disadvantage; for example, 5 �e2 d5 6 .Jlb5 f6! 7 d4 �d6 or 7 ... .Jlg4. b) 4 O-O lbxe4 5 lbc3!? is the maverick Boden-Kiezeritsky Gambit (some inferior moves are: 51:.el d5 6 .Jlb51'.c5!, 5 d4 d5 and 5 �e2 d5 6 Slb51'.g4! 7 d3 .Jlxf3 8 gxf3 lLif6). A tra- ditional main line goes 5... lbxc3 (Black can also spoil White's fun by 5 ... lbd6 6 Sld5 1'.e7 or 5 ... lbf6 6 .l:lel Sle7 7 lbxe5 lbxe5 8 .l:lxe5 d6 9 .l:lel d5 10 Si.f l O-O, with equality in both cases) 6 dxc3 f6 (interesting is 6 ... �e7!? 7 lbg5 lbd8) 7 lbh4 g6 8 f4 �e7 (threatening ... �c5+) 9 'it>hl d6, when Black has a solid game and is still a pawn up, but some players would relish the challenge facing White! c) 4 lbc3 (D) can be unique, especially be cause it can transpose from the Vienna Game with 2 lbc3 lbf6 3 .Jlc4 lbc6 4 lbf3 (to avoid 4 d3 .Jlb4!?): Black can opt for 4 ... .Jlc5, of course, proba bly heading back to lines below; but he can also play more decisively by 4... lbxe4!? 5 lbxe4 (5 O-O is the Boden-Kiezeritsky Gambit again; as usual, Black's centre is more important than his king position after 5 .Jlxf7 +? 'it>xf7 6 lbxe4 d5! 7 lbeg5+ 'it>g8 with ... h6 coming next) 5 ... d5, and we enter some fun and unresolved territory: c 1) 6 .Jlb5? dxe4 7 lbxe5 �g5! is a standard tactical trick of the kind that we also see in the Ruy Lopez. In this particular case White is in big trouble because of the attack on g2 and un fortunate placement of the knight and bishop along the same rank. There follows 8 lbxc6 (8 d4 �xg2 9 .l:lfl a6 10 1'.xc6+ bxc6 will win for Black) 8 ...�xb5 9 lbd4 �e5 10 lbe2 .Jlf5 and Black stands very well. c2) 61'.d3! dxe4 7 1'.xe4 (D). Now: c21) The traditional 7 ... Sld6 81'.xc6+ (8 d4 exd4 91'.xc6+ bxc6 transposes) 8 ... bxc6 9 d4! exd4 10 �xd4 O-O 11 O-O is complicated with an unclear imbalance, perhaps favouring White slightly; e.g., following 11...c5 12 �c3 1'.b7 with two bishops versus better structure. c22) 7 ... lbe7!?

4 d3 (D)
This move quietly protects the e-pawn with a minimum of risk. It is not dangerous for either side but White's modest pawn-push brings up some important positional points. Instead of doing a systematic analysis I want to emphasize a few characteris tic types of positions that one should know to understand this variation. Before I even get to that, very inexperienced players might want take a look at 4 ... i.e7 (a slow move, but not a bad one) 5 'Dg5?! O-O 6 'Dxf7? .l:.xf7 7 i.xf7+ Rxf7. Few players who have built up playing experience with 1 e4 e5 would even consider such a trade for White, but those just starting out are often attracted to this CDg5/CDxf7 idea (which appears in many 1 e4 e5 openings, such as the Giuoco Piano, Goring Gambit and Ruy Lopez). It's important to know that in most chess openings, two pieces are better than rook and pawn, and usually the equal or better of a rook and two pawns, until there arises an ending or a considerably simpli fied position. Of course, that claim contradicts simple point-count chess (White has 6 or 7 points versus Black's 6). The explanation is that the minor pieces enter the action earlier and co ordinate better in attack and defence, especially on a crowded board. Keep in mind that rooks tend to get developed later and, more impor tantly, to get blocked off if there are too many pawns and pieces around. There are few excep tions to this. Thus 5 'Dg5 and 6 'Dxf7 are mis takes. However, you should know that in an end game with a rook and pawns versus bishop and knight, the latter will often have trouble defend ing each other at the same time as they attempt to hold off the pawns. The bishop and knight may do reasonably well if pawns are on the same side of the board, but if the rook is escort ing a pawn or two far from the opponent's king, the minor pieces will normally have a very hard time of it.
4. . .
.tcs s 'Dc3 The position after 5 c3 is examined in Chap ter 5 as part of the Giuoco Piano. 5 ... d6 (D) We have arrived at a completely symmetrical position. Two KNIGHTS DEFENCE 103 It's surprising how much chess content there can be in such a simple position. We'll now look at a number of instructive continuations and themes: 6 tba4 can be met by 6 ... ..tb6 7 tbxb6 axb6, which grants Black a solid game and an open a-file; but that may not be what he wants. There is another way to give up the bishop-pair: 6 ... �e7 7 tbxc5 dxc5. This sequence changes the pawn-structure, and along with it the char acter of the game. In return for the bishop-pair Black gets an open d-file and freedom of devel opment. White's wished-for move d4 will be next to impossible to organize. This kind of ex change varies from position to position, and crops up in the King's Gambit Declined (1 e4 e5 2 f4 .i.c5 3 tbf3 d6 4 .i.c4 followed by d3 and tba4) and even the English Opening, via, for instance, 1 c4 e5 2 tbc3 tbf6 3 tbf3 tbc6 4 g3 .i.c5 5 .i.g2 d6 6 O-O O-O 7 d3 .i.g4 8 tba4, etc. In these cases most experts would tend to regard the trade as an equal one, giving no ex ceptional advantage to either player. 6 .i.e3 .i.xe3 (of course, 6 ... .i.b6 or 6 ... h6 is also possible; in the latter case the exchange on c5 is not particularly effective) 7 fxe3 (D). We talked about this in Chapter 3. White gains two important advantages from this trade: he has opened his f-file and prevented Black's knight from hopping to d4 (normally a main theme of the opening). That means that White might want to move his forces to the kingside; e.g., tbh4-f5 is a good idea. But White's centre pawns have also lost their ability to advance successfully; for example, 7 ... O-O 8 d4 .i.g4. Then Black can simply let the pawn sit on d4, when White has the choice of exchanging on e5, when his remaining e-pawns are doubled and isolated, or advancing to d5, which ham pers his own pieces and does nothing positive. There are a number of versions of this ex change with varying results: sometimes the ad vantages of the doubled pawns will outweigh their disadvantages, but just as often the reverse will be true. What counts is to be aware of the issues. It's very important to know when the move ..tg5 (or ... .i.g4) is useful and when it is detri mental. Although that's a very complex question here are two types of positions that frequently anse: In Case 1, White's bishop pins Black's knight before Black castles by 6 .i.g5 (D). Then the harassment of the bishop by 6 ...h6 7 .i.h4 g5 is successful in so far as 8 tbxg5? hxg5 9 .i.xg5 l:lg8 fails to give White compensation (the best try, 10 h4, is answered by 10 ... .i.g4! and White's attack is at an end). So White plays 8 .i.g3, but then his bishop is a little uncomfort able running into a brick wall of pawns. Black can play 8 ... .i.e6, for instance, and prepare to castle queenside with a fine game. Let's compare Case 2, in which White plays 6 a3, a handy move so that the bishop can be tucked away on a2. On an average level of play Black might respond with 6 ... O-O?!. But now White has 7 ..tg5! (D). Then he threatens tbd5, and the pin is both ersome anyway. By analogy with Case 1, Black might try 7 ... h6 8 .i.h4 g5?, but this time 9 tbxg5! hxg5 10 .i.xg5 is a whole different story. Black has to prevent tbd5, for example by
104 MASTERING THE CHESS OPENINGS
10 ... i.e6, when 11 tl:Bd5 i.xd5 12 exd5 tl:Bb8 13 'irVf3 lands him in big trouble. For instance, 13 ... 'lt>g7 14 h4 tl:ibd7 15 i.b5 (or 15 J::i. h3 J::i. g8 16 'irVf5, etc.) 15 ... tl:Bb6 16 .l:.h3 (there are plenty of options; e.g., 16 c4i.d4 17 .l:.h3) 16 ... tl:ibxd5 17 .l:.g3 'lt>h8 18 'irVf5. Without the opponent castling, this sacrifi cial idea doesn't work, so you can see why both sides tend to play h3 and ... h6 before castling! The old saw about not moving pawns in front of your king has many exceptions. In almost any opening, with 1 e4 or 1 d4, there are plenty of cases where either h3 or g3 will frustrate your opponent's attack. The same applies to ... h6 or ... g6, of course. White targets f7: 4 llJg5 4 tl:Bg5 (D) With this sortie White immediately breaks the rules about moving a piece twice in the opening before the other pieces are developed (and in this case most of White's pieces aren't). For that reason, 4 tl:Bg5 has been called a begin ner's move. Nevertheless, there have been thousands of master games with 4 tl:Bg5 for over a century, and several whole books have been devoted to precisely this position (not to men tion lengthy parts of other books and countless articles). The main point is that, principles not withstanding, Black has a difficult time defend ing f7 without making some kind of concession. White's philosophy is simple: if it works, play it! 4 ... d5 Black cuts off White's bishop with tempo while dramatically helping his central situation and freeing his c8-bishop for action. There are a number of alternatives over the next few moves that I won't be considering. One is the chaotic
4...
i.c5! ?, which has the idea 5 tl:Bxf7 i.xf2+ !? . This has been analysed in excruciating detail, often past 20 moves, by players and theoreti cians. Several experts seem to feel that playing 5 i.xf7+ instead of 5 tl:Bxf7 grants some advan tage. We'll leave the whole mess to them. In spite of the fascinating play that stems from this and other highly tactical sidelines, I shall mainly devote my attention to the main lines and in general the more strategic (and popular) continuations. Naturally the course of events after, say, 4 tl:Bg5 i.c5 or the wilder 4 d4 lines are instructive in the broader sense, conspicu ously so in the realm of attack. They are, how ever, singular in their nature, and the purpose of this book is not to pursue particularities of forc ing play but rather to broaden understanding of openings and tie them together wherever possi ble. 5 exd5 tl:Ba5! (D) Black continues to gain time for development by attacking the c4-bishop. He is willing to sac rifice a pawn to that end. The disorderly 5 ...b5 and 5 ... tl:Bd4 (sometimes transposing) fall into the same category as 4 ... i.c5. A more familiar line to inexperienced players is 5 ... tl:Bxd5, when 6 tl:Bxf7!? 'lt>xf7 7 'irVf3+ 'lt>e6 is known as the 'Fried Liver Attack'. According to theory this line, if properly played, can be defended by Black. White's other try, 6 d4!, has the similar idea 6 ... exd4 7 O-O i.e7 8 tl:Bxf7!, this time lead ing to an extremely strong attack, at least accord ing to the older theory. That's because White
TwO KNIGHTS DEFENCE 105
has more open lines. A lot of study will be re quired of anyone interested in these variations. But we're going to look at 5 ... ll'la5 because most good players choose that move, and be cause the resulting variations are marked by nu merous defined strategic and tactical themes that can teach us about the Open Games. 6 .i.bS+ This is White's point: he will stay a pawn ahead, having no pawn weaknesses himself. His knight may look a little funny out there on g5, but so does Black's on a5. Black has two moves here: 6 ... c6 and 6 ... .i.d7. Be forewarned that what follows is not a complete overview of the latest theory, but examples that will hope fully illuminate the issues involved. Interposition with the Pawn 6 •••c6!? Black sacrifices a pawn, but he gains another tempo by attacking White's bishop and thereby takes the initiative. 7 dxc6 bxc6 8 .i.e2 h6 9 ll'lf3 e4 10 lt'ieS .i.d6 (D) Of course there are legitimate alternatives for both sides along the way. For instance, White could have played Steinitz's 9 ll'lh3 or, instead of 10 ... .i.d6, both 10 ... 'iVd4 and 10 ... .i.c5 have fairly good reputations. But the position after 10 ... .i.d6 arises more frequently than any other. Black wants to use his space advantage and develop quickly by at tacking the e5-knight. Whatever happens, he's a pawn down and has to keep making active and/or forcing moves before White gets his pieces out. Black's first goal is to attack the king, with the hope that the cramping role of his e4-pawn will render White's defence difficult. If that pawn is exchanged, he will develop pressure down the d- and e-files. His only real problem is the wayward knight on a5, which he hopes to reposition by ... lt'Bb7 followed by ... lt'Bc5 or ... lt'Bd6. For his part, White wants to eliminate the e4- pawn. If he can't do that he can bypass the pawn and put his pieces on more active posts, for in stance by playing d4, .i.e3, lt'Bc3 (or lt'Bd2), and perhaps 'iVd2. In a real game all of these plans conflict. You can only get a feel for the ideas by looking at examples. Because of Black's open lines and pressure down the d-file, White will probably have to keep his pieces on passive squares while he unwinds. 11 f4!? Estrin - Levenfish Leningrad 1949 This pawn advance has a poor reputation be cause it weakens White's kingside, but the re sulting play is fairly balanced. One advantage is that White keeps his d-pawn; compare 11 d4 in the games that follow this one. ••. exf3 It's not strictly necessary to make this cap ture, but Black craves space and open lines in return for his pawn. 12 ll'lxf3 O-O 13 O-O 'iVc7 14 d4 c5! We've arrived at a position that can arise from other move-orders. Black wants to break up White's centre and bring his rooks to the centre files as fast as possible. White simply needs to

Note that this is the 'vanish ing centre' that we talked about in the introduc tory chapters. The Open Games ( 1 e4 e5) have a number of these because the move d4 is so ba sic to White's play, as is the move ... d5 to Black's. Obviously that results in a greater like lihood that the entire centre will be eliminated. Such a position is naturally characterized by open lines and tactical play. In this case the tactics don't usually arise for a while as both players jockey to achieve their most effective formations. Then the action starts. At this juncture we'll look at two games.

Moreover, 6 ... ii..d7 doesn't neces- sarily lose a pawn (as 6 ...c6 does), because in some variations Black may recapture White's d-pawn. For the time being, White has an extra pawn, of course, and that provides consolation for his troubles. Furthermore, he has no weak nesses. These imbalances will almost always lead to interesting play. 7 'iVe2 7 ii..xd7+ 'i¥xd7 gives away any chances to gain an advantage because Black regains the d pawn. 7 ••. ii..e7 Black also plays 7 ... ii..d6 and defends his e5-pawn. Then his queen is more cut off from d5, so he probably won't recover his pawn (af ter White protects it with, for instance, 8 lbc3). But when Black's kingside pawns get rolling his bishop will become more effective. It's a trade-off that in practice has worked rather well for Black.

Now for a game: 5 ...d5 Wendland - Groeber corr. 1997 As a rule, Black should make this move 'when he can' in the double e-pawn openings, and indeed, White has no way to avoid a loss of tempo without concessions. On the other hand, one can argue that e5 itself costs White a move, so barring a tactical disaster other responses may be playable. Indeed, White hasn't estab lished an advantage against the following two rare replies, although he has a lot of leeway for improvements. At any rate, both moves contain useful positional ideas. I'll pick out a couple of characteristic lines: a) 5. .. ll'le4 (D). al) 6 'ii' e2 was originally thought to be the problem with 5 ... ll'le4, since 6 ... d5 7 exd6 is no fun for Black. But after 6 ... ll'lc5, Black heads for the ideal blockading square on e6: 7 O-O ll'le6 8 .i.xe6 (8 .l:.dl d5) 8 .. .fxe6!? (a sharp move that combines themes of using the open f-file in conjunction with an unopposed bishop at b7) 9 �g5 (9 .l:.dl d5 10 ll'lxd4 ll'lxd4 11 .l:.xd4 c5 12 .l:.dl �e7 and here we have a good French Defence!) 9 ... �e7 10 �xe7 'it'xe7 11 ll'lbd2 O-O 12 ll'lb3 .l:.f4 13 .l:.adl b6 14 ll'lbxd4 .i.b7 and ... .l:.af8 is coming.

An obvious line is 6 'ii' e2 'ii' e7 7 .i.f4, when Black plays the surpris ing 7 ... d6! and White naturally replies with 8 exd6 (D).

After the queens come off, White expects to recover his pawn on d4 and secure the better middle- and endgame by virtue of Black's

9 O-O
As always, there are move-order issues for both sides but that's more a matter of theory than understanding. As a case in point, delay ing O-O at this juncture by 9 ..i.e3 tips White's hand. Black can then do without the ... ..i.c5 idea; e.g., 9 ... ..i.e7 10 tbd2 c5 11 tb4b3 tbxd2 12 'iVxd2 d4 13 ..i.f4 ..i.b5!?. 9• •• ..i.c5 It may be that 9 ... ..i.e7 is playable, but it al lows a dangerous pawn-roller that represents Black's biggest nightmare in many double e pawn openings. Look at this continuation: 10 f3 tbg5 (10. .. tbc5 11 f4) 11 f4 tbe4 12 f5 c5 (12... ..i.c5!? 13 tbc3!?) 13 tbe2 ..i.b5 14 tba3 ..i.c6 15 c4 d4 16 tbf4 ..i.g5 17 tbd3 !, Svesh nikov-Fercec, Nova Gorica 1996. At first this seems all right for Black. Yet White's knight is the ideal blockader of the d-pawn and targets Black's weak doubled pawn on c5. This frees White's pieces to roam the board, in particular towards the kingside. ..i.e3!? (D) White modestly protects his centre before advancing pawns and exposing his own posi tion, but it may be too slow. White also has the aforementioned f3-f4-f5, although with Black's bishop on c5 that may not be easy to implement. For example, White can trade off kingside expansion for reduced central control by 10 f3 tbg5 11 ..i.e3, when
11...'iVe7 12 f4 tbe4 13 tbd2 or 11...O-O 12 tbc3
is probably about equal.
B
What is going on in this position? As usual, Black is counting upon his two bishops and ac tivity to compensate for his positional problems. Two KNIGHTS DEFENCE 113 He would like to move his bishop to b6 and then successfully achieve the advance ...c5. Given time, White would take advantage of the pawn structure by a combination of moves such as (in some order) f3, 'it'd2, lbc3-a4 and/or lbb3, dominating the board from c5 and rendering the bishops passive. That takes a few moves! 10• •• 'ii' e7! The side with the bishops often depends upon tactical niceties to avoid disadvantages. Now
11 f3 can be answered by 1 l ...lbd6!, since the
e3-bishop hangs. That would be followed up by ... lbf5 (or ...lbc4) with active counterplay. 11 .l:.el Obviously 'it'd2 isn't on the cards, so White prepares f3 another way. But there's quite a dif ference, in that f4-f5 won't be supported by a rook on the f-file. ...O-O 12 f3 lbg5 (D) 13 l'kd2 As a case in point, 13 f4 lbe6! prevents f5 due to exchanges followed by ...�xf5, and in the meantime Black plans to get his centre roll ing by means of ... �b6 and ... c5. 13• •. f6!

7 Phil idor Defence
1 e4 e5 2 tl:Bf3 d6 (D)
The Philidor Defence has one virtue that few e4 e5 openings have: Black decides what opening is played! The underlying ideas of sur render of the centre in the Philidor were men tioned in Chapter 2; we'll explore them more thoroughly and even look at a wild counterat tacking scheme. Then we'll tum to a version of the Philidor that uses a strongpoint approach in one of its purest forms. The characteristic ideas behind this not-so-old-fashioned opening are extremely instructive and applicable to many other openings. The Philidor is not a frequent visitor to master chess but has a remarkable fol lowing of contemporary players who have used the defence extensively through the years. These include quite a few grandmasters, and even Ad ams and Azmaiparashvili have dabbled in the Philidor. Reaching back a few generations, Tigran Petrosian was probably the last World Champion who tried it out. It should be said, however, that most grand masters who want to play the 'strongpoint' ver sion of the Philidor Defence now use the order
1 e4 d6 2 d4 tl:Bf6 3 tl:Bc3 (thus far a Pirc De
fence) 3 ...e5. The idea is that after 4 tl:Bf3 tl:ibd7, Black has got into the main line of the Philidor while avoiding the problems associated with other move-orders that will be listed in this note and the next one. They believe (and theory seems to verify) that the queenless rniddlegame after 4 dxe5 dxe5 5 'iVxd8+ �xd8 is perfectly fine for Black, who has the strategy ... ..i.e6 and ... tl:ibd7. White's main way to strive for an ad vantage is 6 ..i.c4, when Black can accept dou bled pawn in order to cover central squares: 6 ... ..i.e6 !? 7 ..i.xe6 fxe6 (D) with the idea ... ..i.d6 (or .....i.c5 first), ... tl:ibd7 and ... �e7. The posi tion is considered to be equal. The reason that this move-order is consid ered to be superior to (or at least less difficult than) 1 e4 e5 2 tl:Bf3 d6 3 d4 is that in the latter case 3 .. tl:Bf6 4 dxe5 tl:Bxe4 5 'iVd5 is awkward for Black. See the note to 3 ... tl:Bd7 below (in the 'strongpoint' section). By playing 3 ...tl:Bd7, Black can avoid this problem but runs into the possibility of 4 ..i.c4!, as we see below, not to mention the move-order 3 ..i.c4 examined in the next note. If all that is difficult to absorb, it will mean a lot more if you decide to take up the Philidor as Black or are faced with it as White. The most interesting aspect of this overview is that some extremely highly-rated grandmas ters have been willing to play the Philidor De fence via any move-order! After all, for many years the Philidor was considered to be an anti quated and inferior opening for Black. Let's see what ideas have reinvigorated it.
PHIL/DOR DEFENCE 115

3 i.c4 is often overlooked with respect to move-order issues. Then 3 ... tt:'Bf6!? 4 tt:'Bg5 d5 5 exd5 seems bothersome, although a serious ex amination reveals that Black has equality or stands only marginally worse after 5 ...h6 6 tt:'Bf3 e4!; for example, 7 tt:'Be5 (7 'it'e2 can be met by 7 ... i.e7 8 tt:'Be5 O-O {e.g., 9 O-O?! i.c5! } or 7 ... i.b4 !? 8 a3 !?

However, this transposes into a 3 d4 exd4 line, which means that White has successfully pre-empted Black's strong point approach, that is, one in which Black plays ... tt:'ibd7 without ... exd4 (see the 'Strong point' section below). Thus Black may want to look into 3 ... tt:'Bf6. Otherwise, 3 i.c4 makes an other argument for the move-order 1 e4 d6 2 d4 tt:'Bf6 3 tt:'Bc3 e5. The first and obvious point is that Black has allowed White the greater share of the centre and blocked his own f8-bishop behind the d6- pawn, an unfortunate by-product of ...d6 but no terrible thing in itself. There are now two basic strategies that Black can pursue: surrender of the centre or making e5 a strongpoint. Surrender of the Centre

There usually fol lows 8 ... tt:'Bc6 9 g4 i.e6 10 O-O-O tt:'Bxd4 11 i.xd4. This is a position from which White has won many games (and thus discouraged 5 ... g6). Black could certainly use an open c-file, as in the Dragon.

All this is difficult to improve upon. There have been scads of other attempts by Black but he still seems to be in search of a sat isfactory solution. At any rate I shall concen trate upon lines with ... i.e7. With 5 ... i.. e7, Black introduces a strategy that was explicated by Nimzowitsch: ...
O-O,
... .l:.e8, ... i..f8 and ... tt:'ibd7, both restraining and putting pressure on White's e-pawn. White has more space and can thwart a direct attack but still has to find a way to break down Black's defences without allowing his pieces to spring to life. This situation might remind you of similar positions in the King's Indian Defence, such as

In the case of the Philidor, White's c-pawn is on c2 (rather than c4, as in the King's Indian) and Black's bishop is on f8 (rather than g7). You could argue that in the King's Indian, White is more exposed in the centre (d4 is unsupported by pawns); but in the Philidor, Black's counterattacking chances are limited by his passively placed bishop on e 7. Check out what happens in the second game below! 6 .i.e2 White decides to go for a safe space advan tage.

With this move White commits to a pawn structure in which he restricts Black's pieces and increases his space advantage, but fails to support the e-pawn (as f3 does).

Black has insufficient forces to attack and has to play with the back ward d-pawn that we also see in the King's In dian Defence. But d6 is well-protected, which gives Black the leeway to turn his attention to the queenside; his main positive idea consists of attack on that wing based upon ...b5, with the idea that White's forces are tied to protecting against the freeing move . .. d5. For his part, White will develop, double on the d-file, and slowly increase the pressure.

PHIL/DOR DEFENCE 11 7
Counterattack Renet - Fressinet Clichy (rapid) 2001 8 ... �f8 9 �f3 c5!? (D) This bold move has been tried by at least two very strong grandmasters and in at least 20 games! Black doesn't feel like defending pas sively, so he aims at the central dark squares (with ... ll'lc6 next) and stays true to the basic idea of restraining White's centre. That by itself might not make up for his pawn-structure but Black also wants to advance his queenside pawns and attack White's pieces on that wing. To that end he will have support from a bishop on d7 and rook on b8. The obvious drawback is his backward d-pawn on an open file. But as we see in several variations of the Sicilian De fence, such a pawn isn't necessarily an issue. There are lines like this in the Fianchetto Variation of the King's Indian Defence. In that opening White's bishop is on g2, which is obvi ously analogous to a bishop on f3 in the Phili dor. In the position before us, however, Black is missing the powerful bishop on g7 that charac terizes the KID, a condition that seems to be a serious drawback. Nevertheless, from f8 the bishop protects Black's only weakness on d6! How should White react? Obviously he will have to restrain Black's expansion (presumably by a4). And he must eventually expand in the centre or on the kingside. The move g4 sug gests itself, although it must be properly timed so as not to weaken his king position. 10 ll'lde2 White's first decision is important: where to put the knight? From e2 it has prospects of as sisting on the kingside but has no particular square to go to yet. 10 ll'lde2 also allows one of Black's pieces to settle on g4. The most common choice has been 10 ll'lb3, which keeps White's pieces freer to move and the g4-square covered, but from b3 the knight doesn't have anywhere special to go to either. There result some fascinating ideas following 10 ... ll'lc6 (D): Here White has tried various moves to crack Black's strange-looking set-up: a) 11 'it>hl a5!?

He will gener ally follow up with ... 'V/lic7 and/or ... .l:.e8, to bolster e5 while keeping a careful eye on the d6-pawn. Then we come to the point at which he needs to develop his queen's bishop. This may be prefaced by the safe moves ... h6, ... l:Ie8 and ... i.f8 (or even ... ctJf8), or Black may com mence immediately. If he is allowed to com plete the following plan he will usually have solved his problems: Black places his pawns on b6 and a6, his bishop on b7, and then advances with ...b5. With completed development and queenside play, he should stand well, especially since his ideas of ... b4 and central attack are by no means trivial to defend against. Then what is White to do? There are a num ber of answers depending upon one's style of play and the specifics of the position. He has the challenge of breaking down Black's defences, and this time there is no open file or backward pawn to focus upon. However, at the point that Black plays ... b6 (and before ... i.b7) he is vul nerable to the move d5, since capturing will leave White in possession of the key outpost on d5. If Black already has ... .i.b7 in before White

plays d5, then Black has better chances of mak ing a favourable mass-exchange upon that square. The game will hang upon whether ex changes and simplification leave White any thing at all, or whether he can stifle Black's counterplay by other means. There are three standard alternatives to d5: a) b3 and ..i.b2 or ..i.a3; b) a5, to hamper Black's queenside plans; and c) tl:Bh4-f5. Incidentally, this kind of analysis suggests that Black's plan would be even more effective were White's bishop on e2 or fl, where it is of ten placed.

Then White has only a formal superiority. 9 h3 White has other thematic continuations. Not all of them have been put into practice against challenging opposition. a) White sometimes develops with 9 b3, hav ing either ..i.a3 or ..i.b2 in mind.

(9. .. b6 10 'V/J/.d2 ..i.b7 11 tl:Bh4 ! { 11 dxe5 tl:Bxe5} 11...exd4 12 tl:Bf5 gives White the better game; whenever something like this can't be stopped, the plan of ... l:.e8 and ... ..i.f8 looks best) 10 ..i.e3 l:te8 (D ). 11 tl:Bh4!?

In the majority of cases White will probably retain some advantage with proper play, but not enough to invalidate Black's opening.

8 Ruy Lopez
1 e4 e5 2 lll
f3 lll c6 3 ..llb5 ( D) These moves constitute the Ruy Lopez, aptly called the 'King of Openings'. It has domi nated 1 e4 e5 chess for more than 100 years and is considered the best chance for White to gain the advantage in the play that follows 2 ... lllc6. Thereupon hangs the popularity of 1 e4 itself, no small burden for a single move to bear. What's the point of 3 ..llb5? One's first in stinct is that it threatens 4 ..llxc6 followed by 5 lllxe5, but Black's most popular answer 3 ... a6 shows that not to be the case, at least not imme diately. Then of course White wants to castle quickly. But then why do most players use 3 ..llb5 instead of the more aggressive-looking 3 ..llc4, which hits Black's weak f7-pawn? The answer is that 3 ..llb5 is a prophylactic move that works to squelch the opponent's opportuni ties. If you look at the main lines after 3 ..llc4, for instance, it turns out that Black's key defen sive/counterattacking move in a majority of cases is ... d5 (as in most variations after 1 e4 e5), attacking the bishop and establishing him self in the centre. But putting a bishop on b5 ei ther prevents or discourages that move. Let's see how this works in a few simple cases. Obvi ously, the immediate 3 ... d5? is bad due to 4 exd5 'i1Vxd5 5 lllc3 with a terrible loss of time for Black. But what if Black imitates his re sponse to 3 ..llc4 by playing as follows? 3 ... a6 4 ..lla4 b5 5 ..llb3 ( D) After all, White is on the same diagonal as after 3 ..llc4 and Black has a couple of extra moves in ... a6 and ... b5 that may help his posi tion or at least not hurt it. The answer is that the move ...d5 can no lon ger be played with tempo, which negatively im pacts both of Black's normal defences after 3 ..llc4. That consideration overrides all others, as we can see from the following discussion (see Chapters 5 and 6 on 3 ..llc4 if you need to). First, compare the old line 3 ..llc4 lllf6 4 d4 (notice that after 4 lllc3, Black has the excellent response 4 ... lll xe4! 5 lll xe4 d5, whereas this would be a blunder with White's bishop on b3) 4... exd4 5 e5, when 5 ... d5 ! gains a critical tempo. Not so with a bishop on b3 instead of c4. Then, look at other main-line defence to 3 ..llc4, i.e. 3 ... ..llc5 4 c3 lllf6 5 d4 exd4 6 cxd4 (6 e5 d5 !) 6 ... ..llb4+ 7 ..lld2 ..llxd2+ 8 lll bxd2 d5 ! 9 exd5 lllxd5 with equality; the Ruy Lopez prevents such solutions, as I'll show below for clarity's sake.
5. .. ..llc5
The equivalent of the Two Knights Defence would go 5 ... lllf6 6 d4! (D) (6 lllg5 is probably no improvement upon the main 3 ..llc4 lllf6 lines, but this is strong):

A sample line might be 8 ... ..llb4 (pre venting .l:!.el ; 8 ... lllgxe5?? loses to 9 lllxe5 lllxe5 10 .l:!.el d6 11 f4) 9 c3 (or 9 ..lld5 threatening h3) 9 ... dxc3 10 bxc3 ..llc5 11 'i1Vd5!

(D) White's move serves not j ust to attack the al most-trapped e4-knight, but also to stop ... d5. That's the consistent theme involved in an early ..llb3. 9 ...f5 Black can try the somewhat cheap win of three pawns for a piece by 9 ... lllxf2?! 10 'it>xf2 dxc3+, but after 11 'it>g3! White connects rooks and threatens 12 ..llxf7+ 'it>xf7 13 'i1Vd5+. Thus Black is stuck with 1 l...cxb2 12 ..llxb2 O-O 13 lllc3! (or 13 h4) 13 ... ..llb7 14 llle4 ..lle7 15 'i1Vd2 and White dominates the board. His king is un touchable, and in general three pawns aren't worth a minor piece this early in the game (un less two or three of them are passed and moder ately advanced). When you factor in White's activity and far superior development, the as sessment is clear. 10 cxd4 ..llb4+ ll lllbd2 Black can't even castle, but White will play O-O and gain a very large advantage. For the record, Black can try to j ustify 1 e4 e5 2 lllf3 lllc6 3 ..llb5 a6 4 ..lla4 b5 5 ..llb3 with the odd move 5 .. . llla5!? (the 'Norwegian Varia tion'), based upon 6 lllxe5 lllxb3 7 axb3 'i1Vg5, etc. But simply 6 O-O d6 7 d4 is thought to give White the advantage. Returning to 3 ..llb5, we have seen one local ized reason for preferring 3 ..llb5 over 3 ..llc4. But what characterizes the Ruy Lopez itself? Since each opening variation that begins on move 3 is so different in attributes, we cannot speak of the 'nature' of the Ruy Lopez without referring to specific systems. The most interest ing way to approach the subject is to take a somewhat impressionistic historical look. In the early days of the Ruy Lopez we saw some understandable experimentation with moves such as 3 ... llld4 and 3 ... f5, both still playable today but on the very margins of legitimacy. As positional concepts solidified, the great masters of the late 19th and early 20th centuries drifted towards 1 e4 e5 2 lll f3 lllc6 3 ..llb5 d6, which is featured in the games of Steinitz, Lasker, Capa blanca and many others. Without taking the time to examine that variation (an exercise that is well worth it), I can't demonstrate its draw backs; but the crucial thing to remember is that Black will immediately or eventually be forced to surrender the centre by means of ... exd4 in
124 MASTERING THE CHESS OPENINGS
order to avoid complete passivity. Tarrasch is famous for helping to demonstrate this fact (and in fact he proposed the more dynamic Open V aria tion of the Ruy Lopez as an alterna tive to the ...d6 lines). Then came the so-called 'Closed' variations. The majority of players ultimately grew dis content with having to live in the cramped situ ations that 3 ... d6 and ... exd4 usually imposed. Without dismissing options such as the re cently-revived order 3 .. . lt::i f6 (the Berlin De fence) 4 O-O lt::i xe4 5 d4 lt::i d6 6 i.xc6 dxc6 7 dxe5 lt::i f5, we find that the preponderance of masters turned to the more subtle move-order 3 ... a6 4 i.a4 lt::i f6 followed by ... i.e7, ... b5 and ... d6. The resulting variations tended to prevent White from gaining the degree of space he commanded in the old ... exd4 lines. These for mations, arguably the most consistently im portant in all of chess history, are collectively named the 'Closed Ruy Lopez'. They are char acterized by well-defended pawns on d6 and e5 that form a bulwark against White's advances. Black generally achieves smooth development that targets each central square. To the extent that White prevents Black's freeing moves, so Black stops White from redeploying his pieces without risking the escape of his opponent's pieces from their cramped quarters. In particu lar, the moves ...d5 and ... exd4 carry with them the potential for dynamism that can take ad vantage of White's relatively defensive minor pieces. In the meantime, his strongpoint of e5 and pawn on d6 give him a 4th-rank anchor that is usually lacking in other e4 openings such as the Sicilian, Caro-Kann, Pirc, Alekhine, etc. Arguably only the French Defence routinely maintains a 4th-rank strongpoint, and that at the cost of a passive light-squared bishop. In the Ruy Lopez too, there is generally a passive piece in the form of the bishop behind the lines on e7. However, that bishop is always devel oped past the first rank and can theoretically in fluence both sides of the board. Such was the broad story of the Ruy Lopez until the past two decades. After playing strong point positions for so long, Black began to look for more dynamic possibilities. First, without entirely jettisoning the idea of maintaining a pawn on e5 in the initial stages of the opening, top players increasingly used piece-play to target the centre. The Chigorin Defence and related lines were supplemented by systems which did without ... c5 entirely in order to at- tack e4 by means of ... i.b7 and ... �e8, with the intention of pawn exchanges and even the free ing advance ... d5. Thus, for example, the devel opment of the dynamic Zaitsev Variation and lively advances in the formerly stodgy Breyer Defence. Of late there have appeared new-found ways of opening lines in particular positions based upon White's mode of development. Within the ...e5/. ..c5 structures of the Chigorin Defence, for example, Black has skipped ... "Viil c7 in favour of immediately exchanging centre pawns, and in other cases the move ... exd4 alone has been used to establish a queenside majority accompanied by active piece deploy ments. Most interesting has been the complete liquidation of the centre by means of the two exchanges ... cxd4 and ... exd4. Finally, confron- tation by ... d5 is on the increase. What is White trying to do in the Closed variations? The first thing to realize is that there are very few variations in which he launches a mating attack or acts particularly aggressively within the first ten moves. In the main varia tions, his idea continues to be prophylactic, i.e. he tries to restrict Black's moves to those that are somewhat passive and fail to free his game. The idea is that his space advantage in the cen tre (by no means a substantial one) allows him to keep the game under control. When Black does get frisky and tries to go tactical, White has attempted to arrange it that he will come out on top in any melee. In the meantime White slowly builds up his position and puts pressure on at least one area of the board and often two. A queenside attack beginning with a4 is com mon because it is not so easy for Black to de fend b5 without compromising his position. But over time White can also mount a kingside attack. In that regard, notice the direction in which White's bishops aim in the Ruy Lopez, and they can be reinforced by knights on f5 (af ter the exotic-looking but now routine lt::i d2-fl g3/e3) while the other knight can head towards g5 or, for example, to g4 via h2. If lt::i f5 is pre vented by ... g6 White sometimes plays i.h6 (nudging the rook away from the sensitive f7- square), the move "Viil f3, and so forth. Ideally (from White's point of view), Black will have to
RUY LOPEZ 125
play defensively until he can't protect against every breakthrough on both wings. This game program is what's glibly referred to as the 'Spanish Torture'. We shall see how White's plans evolve when we inspect the individual Closed variations below. In its general con tours, by the way, the above description also applies to the Open Ruy Lopez: White tries to keep Black's dynamism under control and then switches to a gradual augmentation of his posi tional advantages. Let's look at the moves that introduce the Closed Ruy Lopez:
1 e4 e5 2 lll
f3 lllc6 3 i.b5 a6 4 i.a4 We'll see the Exchange Variation with 4 i.xc6 dxc6 later on. Note that after 5 lllxe5 'i1Vd4 Black recovers his pawn. Thus if White's e-pawn becomes protected, the capture on e5 may become a threat. 4• .•lll f6 ( D) We saw the move 4 ... b5 above. With this flexible continuation, Black threat ens White's important e-pawn before deciding upon the development of his other pieces.
5 O-O
For example, the passive 5 d3 allows Black to become more aggressive without much risk:
5... b5 (notice that since e4 is covered, i.xc6 and
lllxe5 has become a threat; however, 5 ... i.c5 is another legitimate move-order, since 6 i.xc6 dxc6 7 lllxe5? loses to 7 ... 'i1Vd4 - both f2 and the e5-knight hang) 6 i.b3 i.c5 7 O-O (7 lllxe5 lllxe5 8 d4 i.xd4 { 8 ... lllxe4!? 9 dxc5 i.b7 10 O-O 'i1Vf6 is also possible} 9 'i1Vxd4 d6 leaves Black a full tempo up on the Meller Variation; we devote a section to that variation below) 7 ... d6. Black has his bishop outside his pawn chain and stands solidly. Of course, there's much more that can be said about 5 d3, but in general White would rather wait a move or two until he sees what his opponent is up to. 5 •.• i.e7 The first major decision about how Black will set his position up. After 5. .. b5 6 i.b3, 6 ... i.c5 is the Meller Variation, examined in depth later; and 6 ... i.b7 is called the Arkhangelsk, a varia tion which I won't be investigating. The main alternative is 5. .. lllxe4, the important Open Vari ation, which reaches its standard position after

6 d4 is a sideline that might not be very inter
esting had we not seen something like it in the introduction to the Ruy Lopez above, but with the moves i.b3 and ... b5 included. There White gained the advantage, but here the presence of the bishop on a4 makes equalizing relatively easy.

As always, it involves move-orders. If Black plays 7...O-O at this point, he can answer 8 c3 with the famous Marshall Attack 8 ...d5, as discussed later. To avoid that White will often play the Anti Marshall 8 a4 (as popularized by Kasparov) or
8 h3 with similar intent (in that case to allow
White to capture the pawn safely after 8 ... d5 9 exd5 lt:Jxd5 10 lt:Jxe5). However, after 7 ... d6, the move 8 a4 is no longer very effective be cause e5 is defended and Black can develop smoothly by 8 ... ..lld7, 8 ... b4, 8 ... ..llb7, or even 8 ...lt:Ja5!?; see the section on the Marshall At tack for details. After 8 h3, Black can play 8 . ..O-O (or 8 ... ..llb7, or 8 ... lt:Ja5!), when 9 c3 re turns us to the main line. To summarise: after 7 ...

The immediate 9 d4 enjoys periodic popu larity but you'll have to do the real work your self to discover its secrets. Since the point of 9 h3 was to prevent the pin on his knight, Black will take immediate advantage of the chance to fight for d4 by 9 ... ..llg4.

with ... c5, and then adopted a strongpoint policy by defending e5. He feels that an immediate ex change on d4 would amount to a surrender of the centre and puts that idea on hold with l 1 ...'i1Vc7. However, White must constantly watch over po tential central exchanges, a situation that Black hopes will limit his opponent's free develop ment. After l 1...'i1Vc7, Black will generally try to bring his pieces out slowly before taking any drastic action in the centre. There are some drawbacks to this strategy. The first has to do with finding a useful, posi tive plan. Exerting pressure down the c-file is natural but generally White can defend the crit ical squares. Often Black will have to bring enough pieces to bear that a capture or two on d4 will make White's centre vulnerable. At that point White can implement his own ideas. He can exchange pawns on c5 and try to exploit the d5-square, or he can play d5 and then attack on the wings, sometimes by means of a4 and some times by piece-play on the kingside. In general White has the choice of developing his pieces or closing the centre. Black's biggest problem tends to be his knight on a5. He can return it to c6, of course, but that consumes time and can provoke a timely d5. Furthermore, White's d5 advance in and of itself can keep the a5-knight out of play. At that point ... lllc4-b6 isn't bad, but it shows up an underlying problem with ... c5 combined with ... e5: a pawn on d5 can't be undermined by ... c6. We shall come back to the idea of omitting ...'i1Vc7. For the moment, here are two sample games which illustrate the classic Chigorin po sition:

:ds This is a flexible move. It discourages White from playing dxe5 and leaves the bishop on the c8-h3 diagonal for now in anticipation of d5. We shall see 1 2 ... cxd4 in the next game, with a note on 1 2. .. lll c6. 13 b3! Also flexible: White keeps Black's knight out of c4 and would like to make simple moves such as i.b2 and :c 1. Although it seems ob scure at this point, b3 can also work with the moves a4 and i.d3, which are designed to tar get b5 - watch for this theme in other games with the Closed Ruy Lopez.
13. .. i.d7
Black sometimes plays ... i.b7 instead of ... i.d7, but in the former case he should ex change in the centre first, because of 1 3 ... i.b7 1 4 d5! (D). This gives White almost everything that he could want from advancing his pawn, a com mittal decision that sometimes releases the pressure on Black's game. Let's consider this position. Black's bishop is badly placed on b7 because its scope is limited by White's pawn chain and unfortunately the move .. .f5 is no where in sight. Thus Black will play ... i.c8 and probably ... i.d7 with loss of time. What about that knight on a5? Right now it has no moves whatsoever because of White's pawns on b3 and d5; as a rule if Black permits White to play d5 it's a good idea to have the move ... lllc4 in

hand. Then even if the knight is driven away, b6 is a good place from which to keep an eye on White's a4 break, and Black reserves pros pects of ... lllbd7. However, in the diagram (af ter 13 ... ..llb7 14 d5), Black will have to move his bishop in order to reroute the knight to the uninspiring b7. From that square, alas, it is blocked from moving by the pawns on d6 and c5. Notice that if Black plays ...c4 and White plays b4, the situation is even worse. All right, it's a closed position and perhaps the knight can make just one more move from b7 to become useful, i.e . ... lll d8. But again, it is completely restricted, this time by White's d5-pawn! Even in a closed position, all this reorganization to little effect gives White plenty of time to pre pare and launch an attack. The moral of the story is that with a bishop on b7, Black should almost always play ... cxd4 and perhaps even ...exd4 once the restrictive move b3 is in. Apart from that, both sides need to develop a feeling about whether to play/allow d5 if c4 is still available to the knight and/or Black's bishop is placed on d7 in support of the queenside. These decisions are terribly difficult and greatly as sisted by playing experience with the opening. 14 lll fl lllc6?! Black gets into trouble after this. 14 ... cxd4 1 5 cxd4 :ac8 looks better.

Indeed, the main alternative 1 0 d3 ctJbd7 1 1 t0bd2 �b7 1 2 ctJfl ctJc5 has been analysed to more than 20 moves with a verdict of equality. 10 ... tLlbd7 11 ctJbd2 �b7 (D) Note for the unwary: 1 1 ...l::t e8?? allows 1 2 �xf7+! with the idea 12. . . @xf7 1 3 ctJg5+ 'it'g8 14 lLJe6. To reach the position in the diagram, Black has wasted two moves getting re-developed and his pawns do not fight for control of d4 as in the Chigorin and Keres variations (with ...c5). Nor has he chased White's bishop off the ideal a2- g8 diagonal. In fact, he has a position that re sembles a Philidor Defence (as does the �xf7+ tactic). So what's the point? First of all, Black has no weakness on d5 and can expel any piece that lands there with ...c6. Then there's the ele mentary fact that White has to search for a plan. Consider his three main approaches against the Chigorin and Keres Defences. White sometimes played d5, a pawn that is now subject to under mining by ...c6 with the danger that White, if compelled to play dxc6, will grant Black a central majority. The second idea of capturing Black' s e-pawn and swinging a knight to d5 is not only fairly useless, as mentioned above, but hard to implement. And that leads to White' s third normal plan and in this case the most promising: ctJfl -e3/g3. However, we see that 1 2 ctJfl ? drops the e-pawn. How exactly will White get the reorganization he wants? 12 �c2 Remarkably, White abandons his favourite diagonal without being chased away! For the record, the move 1 0 d3 that we mentioned above had the point of ctJbd2-fl-e3 without needing to retreat by �c2. But in that variation Black could get ... ctJc5 in, which in turn is the target of attack by d4, and so forth - this is all much too obscure for our purposes. After 1 2 �c2, the onus i s on Black to make some sort of useful move as White pursues his knight tour. Hence: 12• ••:es (D) The basic plan now is ... �f8, with ...g6, ... �g7 and ...h6. This maximizes Black's mi nor-piece pressure upon e4 and d4 such that White needs to take into account the moves ... exd4 and even ...d5 at every turn. The move ...c6 is essential in many lines (again, compare the Philidor Defence), but given the opportu nity, Black might even be able to sneak in our old Chigorin-style ... c5, when for starters his d7-knight sure beats a knight on a5 !

In the last case, for example, 13 ... i.f8 can be answered by 14 i.d3 aiming at the queenside.

It's now customary for Black to bring a knight to d3 and White to swing his rook to g3 in this line; what counts are the specific tactics and one's skill in carrying them out. Contrary to the impression given by this game, there's a fair amount of room for original play in even these critical Zaitsev lines, and the odds of the aver age player or even a master reaching something this theoretical are extremely low.

RUY LOPEZ 141
if Black manages to create a successful strong point defence by ...d6 with his bishop outside the pawn-chain, then he has the best of both worlds. The M0ller has enjoyed a great revival among the world' s best players over the past ten years or so. You can imagine how liberating it feels to live for once without that passive bishop on e7 ! But along with his advantages, Black is presented with a few challenges. Con cretely, White has the fork trick 7 ctJxe5 CLixe5 8 d4. Then, on a positional level, White's i.g5 can pin the f6-knight and it can't be unpinned by ... i.e7. It also turns out that Black' s queen side is difficult to protect, much as in the Closed variations but more awkwardly because the bishop gets in the way. Perhaps most impor tantly, Black has to be careful that, if his attack ing ambitions are frustrated, he isn't left with a forlorn bishop cut off from the action on b6. 7 a4! White can also play the critical variation 7 CLixe5 CLixe5 8 d4, forcing Black into 8 ... i.xd4 9 iVxd4 d6 (D). For years everyone assumed that this was a grave drawback to 6 ... i.c5. It gives White the two bishops and the greater share of the centre. It turns out, however, that Black's remaining pieces have great scope and are very well-placed to attack the key e4 point. First, ... c5-c4 is threatened, winning the bishop, and that threat gives Black time to develop his pieces aggres sively.

The M0ller is a fascinating and unresolved variation. Open Variation I e4 e5 2 lt:Jf3 lt:Jc6 3 .Jlb5 a6 4 .Jla4 lt:Jf6 5 O-O lbxe4 (D) The starting position of the Open Variation of the Ruy Lopez. Now we're leaving the realm of Black's 1 st-3rd rank manoeuvring in favour of staking a full claim to the centre. Perhaps be cause of this assertive posture, the Open Ruy has been the playground for some of the sharp est tacticians in history. As always, you'll have to be careful about the move-orders, which we'll cover in the next few notes. For instance, the inverted moves 5 ...b5 6 .Jlb3 lt:Jxe4?! can run into 7 a4! (D). Instead, 7 d4 d5 transposes to the main line, and 7 l:.el d5 8 lt:Jc3 lt:Jxc3 9 dxc3 .Jle6 1 0 a4 b4 1 1 a5 ! ? is a recurring tactical idea: White threatens .Jla4 and then lt:Jxe5. This is some what unclear but difficult for Black. We've seen the power of a4 throughout the Ruy Lopez, and it especially applies to the Open Variation. After 7 a4, the play might go: a) 7 ... b4 8 .l:Iel d5 9 d3 lt:Jf6 10 a5 ! . b ) 7 .. . .Jlb7 8 .l:Iel lt:Ja5 9 .Jla2 and White has ideas of d3 or d4 and lt:Jg5. c) 7 ... l:.b8 8 axb5 axb5 9 .l:Iel d5 10 lt:Jc3 !, and now, for example, 10. .. lt:Jxc3 1 1 dxc3 .Jle6 1 2 .l:Ia6 �d7 1 3 .l:Ixc6! �xc6 1 4 lt:Jxe5 �c5 ( 1 4. .. �d6 1 5 .Jlf4) 1 5 lt:Jxf7 !

Black announces that he is playing dynamically and will steer clear of those protracted positional struggles that we have seen above (often with no exchanges in the first 20 moves). Neverthe less, the Open Ruy has a great number of con sistent positional features, more so than the average attacking system. Already the funda mental question arises: tactics apart, what is each side playing for? In the positional phase,
RUY LOPEZ 145
we have an answer that comes close to being universal: control of the d4-, e5- and c5-squares. Assuming that the e5-pawn isn't captured or liquidated, the real battle tends to be around d4 and c5. That may seem too broad a statement, yet if you study this opening you'll be surprised to see that games consistently come down to this theme, whether directly or in the back ground. If White can prevent Black from suc cessfully playing the moves ... c5 and ...d4, he will generally have the upper hand. If Black gets one of those moves in without negative consequences, he'll usually equalize or better. The reasons are relatively simple. From White's point of view, securing an outpost on c5 can completely tie down his opponent and fix his backward pawn on c7 or c6. As for Black's prospects, you can imagine the effects of the move ...d4: freeing his e6-bishop, activating his c6-knight, and cramping White' s pieces (or, in the case of cxd4, opening up the d-file). Since the opponents are usually very well aware how crucial these factors are, we'll of ten see one of them switch to an attacking or tactical mode if it appears they are losing the d4/c5 struggle. From the diagrammed position on the pre vious page, I'll present game material with a series of different 9th moves. It will at least give you a start towards understanding how the Open Ruy should and should not be played by both sides. Keres - Euwe The Hague/Moscow Wch 1948 9 �e2 (D) This queen move has always been hanging around in the margins. White's usual idea is .l:Idl followed by c4, although he may just play lt:Jbd2 depending upon Black's course of action. 9 •.• .ii. e.7 For example, 9 ... .ii. .c5 is met by 1 0 lt:Jbd2. 10 .l:Idl O-O 11 c4! bxc4 12 .ii. .xc4 We have reached a well-known position.

(D) Moving out of the pin and hitting b2. 14 .. .f6 ! ? is Black's normal source of counterplay when pressured in the centre. Theory doesn't like Black's chances in the tactics that follow, but they seem to work for him; e.g., 1 5 exf6 ( 1 5 �xe4?! dxe4 1 6 .ii. .xe6+ Rh8 1 7 .l:Ixd8 .l:Iaxd8 1 8 lt:Jfd2 lt:Jxe5) 1 5. .. �xf6 1 6 .l:Ixd5?! �xb2 1 7 �xe4 .ii. .xd5 1 8 .ii. .xd5+ Rh8 1 9 .ii. .xc6 .l:Iad8 ! .

This is an ideal system for the average player, both from a practical and educational point of view. Exchange Variation

Instead, 4 .Jla4 lLif6 5 O-O .Jle7 6 .Jlxc6!? dxc6 is the 'Delayed Ex change Variation ' . Oddly, White takes two moves to capture the knight on c6 when he could have taken it straightaway on move 4.

Instead, 4 ... bxc6 captures towards centre, but as in many openings the capture away from the centre is better. Instead of freeing Black's queen and queen's bishop, 4 ...bxc6 slows Black's de velopment and puts no obstacles in the way of White's d4 (compare 5 d4 below). If Black could play an effective ...d5 at some point he might have some justification, but White will normally be able either to prevent that or to re spond with e5 to good effect. Play can continue

We now return to 4 ... dxc6 (D):
5 O-O
The first basic idea of the Exchange Variation is that White has the superior pawn-structure, and that he will sooner or later exchange his d pawn for Black's e-pawn, establishing a 4:3 pawn-majority on the kingside. He hopes to win a simplified position by using that majority to create a passed pawn, whereas Black's 4:3 majority is 'crippled' and incapable of doing the same thing. Consequently, White will tend to win the vast majority of pure king-and-pawn endings. However, there's a lot more going on here. First of all, Black possesses the bishop-pair, which can be in and of itself compensation for a weakness. Then I think there's a rule of thumb in his favour: usually the earlier in the game that one side establishes an 'advantage in the long run' such as doubled, backward, or iso lated pawns, the less likely it is to last into the endgame, or cause harm if it does persist that far. In large part this is due to the fact that the opponent has more time to adjust to the prob lem and solve it directly or find counterplay. With that in mind, one can imagine that having more pieces on the board favours the side with the weaknesses. And that's where a hypotheti cal problem arises: it may not seem vital at first, but White has a lead in development. This means that he can sometimes control the dis position of forces and arrive at the kind of po sition in which Black will be compelled to exchange pieces. If the pawn-structure isn't changed thereby, White comes closer to the sort of endgame that he would prefer. In my ob servation, however, the 4:3 endgame advantage very seldom arises in games between strong players. In reality it is just as likely that Black's bishops and active play will effect some struc tural change along the way. However, barring favourable exchanges (and it takes a lot of them before a true endgame will come into view), White may still be able to use his lead in devel opment and in some cases his greater control of territory to build up his forces and break through in the centre before Black is ready for it. That seems to be the more common way in which White makes progress. Conversely, the varia tions in which Black successfully restrains White's central pawns or the ones in which he develops rapidly have proven the most effective in equalizing. This brings us to the difference between White's more modem move 5 O-O and the tradi tional 5 d4. The latter move has a certain logic, because White needs to disturb his opponent's game before Black can secure his position and find roles for his bishops. But after 5 d4 exd4 6 'i*'xd4 (6 lbxd4 c5 is easy for Black, because af ter the exchange of queens, the two bishops can

develop quickly in coordination with harassing White's king) 6 ... 'ii' xd4 7 ctJxd4 (D), the situa tion has changed. White's special advantage of having more pieces in play has disappeared. Given that cir cumstance, we're down to the effectiveness of the two bishops versus the potential advantages of White's pawn-structure. Let's see: 7 ... i.d7! (the idea is to get castled quickly, bringing the rook to the open d-file, and perhaps play ...c5 and ... i.c6; 7 ... c5 is a good alternative; on the other hand 7 ... i.d6!? commits Black to a par- ticular development; then 8 ctJc3 ctJe7 9 O-O O-O 1 0 f4 Ile8 1 1 lbb3 f6 1 2 f5 ! ? b6 1 3 i.f4 is the famous game Lasker-Capablanca, St Petersburg 1 9 14, in which Black was probably not worse but he had to defend accurately and lost) 8 i.e3 O-O-O 9 lbd2 (9 lbc3 i.b4) 9 ... lbe7 (9 ...c5 1 0 lbe2 b 6 sets up a structure that Black normally likes, because it is sound and makes room on c6 for a bishop or knight; for instance, 1 1 O-O-O lbe7 1 2 ctJc4 lbc6 with equality) 10 O-O-O lbg6 ( 1 0 .. .f6 1 1 f3 ctJg6 1 2 h4 h5 1 3 ctJc4 c5 1 4 ctJf5 i.e6 is solid and equal, if uninspiring, Miles Karpov, Biel 1 992) 1 1 h3 Ile8 1 2 .l:thel i.d6 1 3 lbe2 f5 !? 14 exf5 ctJh4 1 5 ctJc4?

You can see how easy Black's play is after 5 d4 and why 5 O-O (D), to which we now return, is generally preferred. After 5 O-O Black can choose among a wide array of defences, but most of them offer White good prospects for advantage. We'll focus on three that hold their own, and follow a few games (with a number of imbedded excerpts) in order to get a close feel for the ideas. 5••• i.d6 Milu - Vajda Bucharest 1995 This modest and logical development bol sters e5 and retains options for the knight and c8-bishop. It keeps the game interesting but is also non-forcing; thus it offers White more op portunities to create trouble for his opponent than the other two moves under consideration.
6 d4 (D)
White should develop as rapidly as possible. as explained above, and he also wants Black to play ...exd4 to establish his 4:3 kingside major ity. Black's bishops would find the time to de velop smoothly after 6 d3 ctJe7; for example. 7 i.e3 O-O 8 lbbd2 (8 c3 ! ?) 8 ...f6 9 a3 (probably White would be better off with 9 c3 or 9 l0c4. although in the latter case Black might cause the same kind of problems by 9 ... i.g4) 9 ... c5 l 0 lbc4 i.g4 l l b4? cxb4 1 2 lbxd6 cxd6 1 3 h3 ( 13 axb4 f5 ! and the f3-knight is in trouble) 1 3. .. i.xf3 14 'iVxf3 bxa3 1 5 .l:tfbl b5, Ungu reanu-Flear, Lenk 1 992.

'iVh4!?) 8 i.e3 O-O intends ...f5, a double-edged move that is good in a position like this because it opens lines; e.g., 9 lbc3 f5 1 0 exf5 lbxf5 1 1 lbxf5 i.xf5 with free and easy development. You can see that White's kingside majority is no longer a relevant factor.

7 ... f6 (D) An unfortunate necessity versus e5 which puts White even further ahead in development. However, if Black gets just a few moves to con solidate by ... ti'Je7-g6 and ... i..e6, he'll control e5 and stand well positionally. We looked briefly at this position in Chap ter 2 when discussing the vanished centre. As explained there, static factors are temporarily more important than dynamic ones, although that might change at any moment. White would like to make inroads before Black can stabilize the position. Given time, the bishop-pair might begin to assert itself. White's other option is to eliminate one of the bishops, probably the one on d6; he can hardly stand worse in that case but the time it takes to achieve this will usually let Black equalize or come very close to doing so. 8 i.. e3 A flexible move that develops without com mitting the bl -knight. Alternatively: a) 8 e5 fxe5 9 ti'Jxe5 lets Black catch up in development again: 9 ... ti'Jf6 (or 9 ...

However, I think that this is the exception and not the rule, and that the most important lesson of these examples as a whole is that Black usually has the where withal either to change the pawn-structure or otherwise to create counterplay in return for his doubled c-pawns. As indicated above, the way that White usu ally gets the edge in practice is by exploiting his development and space to create some other type of advantage, even if it means straighten ing out Black's pawns. White can often succeed in doing this and give himself real chances; whether he can achieve enough to win the game is another matter. Also, some of Black's early options deserve attention. 5 ... i.g4 (D) This is the most radical move and the one that was originally thought to be the most seri ous problem with 5 O-O. Now 6 d4 loses a pawn, and slow moves allow, for example, ... 'iVf6 and ...O-O-O and/or ... i.c5. Thus White prefers to attack the black bishop right away.

For all that, White shouldn't feel overconfident: years ago, Blatny tried 1 1 ...tt:.lb6 followed by ... c5 and ... .Bd6; this deserves some attention. Of course, Black needn't gambit; he usually plays 8 ... .Bb7 9 d3 (D). After this modest protection of the e-pawn, White has several methods of arranging his pieces. For example, he can divorce himself
160 MASTERING THE CHESS OPENINGS
entirely from the Closed Ruy lines by lbc3, per haps to be followed by lbd5. He can play c3, in more or less traditional fashion (ctJd2-fl might follow).

The minute that Black defends his e-pawn, he is free to play ... lba5 and rid himself of White's active bishop. With 1 0 a3, White gives the bishop a square to drop back to.

(Black plays the familiar rerouting move with his bishop even though there's no pawn on d5 - his idea is to play the also-familiar ... .Be6 and challenge White to exchange; early success often leads to repetition and I suspect that other moves will become more popular here) 1 4 c3 ( 1 4 ctJe3 .Be6 15 .Bd5 !, as in Sutovsky-Beliav sky, Gothenburg Echt 2005, is interesting and perhaps even favourable for White; for the mo ment these h3/d3 set-ups are still producing some original positions) 1 4. .. .Be6 1 5 .Bxe6 fxe6

It's amusing that in a very similar position from this h3/d3 variation, the move ... .Be6 is al most never answered by .Bxe6, whereas here the world's best players have done so repeat edly.

The starting position for the main lines of the Marshall Attack. Essentially, the idea for Black is to move pieces to the kingside and check mate, whereas White wants to prevent that and remain a pawn ahead! It's not quite that simple, of course. For example, Black will usually gain some advantage in the centre as well, so that even if White beats back the attack and remains a pawn ahead, the game will often be drawn. Black's initial attack is based upon exploiting the light-square weaknesses that White will have to create in order to fend off mate. And White's defence will often consist of counterat tacks that involve the sacrifice of material. At the very least he will try to open queenside lines with a4 and axb5, hoping for Ila6 or Ila7. Still, the action is mainly on the kingside. When I opened a book on the Marshall At tack and looked at the first paragraph of the first chapter, I learned that for the 'old main line' (which is still extremely popular), "the real

struggle begins around move 30"! And in fact, correspondence games sometimes take it a step further, with one side playing a new move as the endgame begins ! Just to make it worse, the majority of these analyses end in drawn posi tions. In fact, this ultimate drawishness, in combination with the tiresome theory, has dis couraged numerous players from trying the Marshall. However, on a practical level, such considerations may not be relevant. At any rate. even the very best players have discov ered ways to create opportunities over the board, as in the game that follows. 12 d4 Kramnik - Leko Brissago Wch ( 8) 2004 The main line.

9 Ki ng's Gambit
I e4 e5 2 f4 (D) With the move 2 f4 we come to the King's Gambit, opening of the great romantics of the 1 9th century. It is associated with wild attacks and sacrifices of pieces, with each side focused firmly upon their opponent's king. In modem times, however, it has become commonplace to describe the King's Gambit as an opening that has taken on a simplifying character and leans towards the endgame. Neither of these descrip tions is very relevant to today's play, because most if not all of the great attacking lines have been neutralized and the early transition into endgames is a relatively unusual occurrence, given publicity by just a few older games involv ing well-known players. Although the King's Gambit has no fixed disposition, modem play ers interpret it primarily in a positional manner, with sudden outbreaks of irrationality. Why would White play 2 f4? For a few fun damental reasons: a) It tries to exchange a flank pawn for a central pawn, thereby giving White a central majority. This is no small achievement, as we see in numerous openings ranging from the Queen's Gambit to the Sicilian Defence. b) After either one of the moves ...exf4 or fxe5, White gains the open f-file. This dovetails nicely with quick development by means of the moves tbf3, .tc4 and O-O. In the best of worlds, White might even get d4 and .txf4 in, estab lishing the elementary picture of ideal piece placement. c) The traditionally weak f7-square (which is guarded only by the king) is a target both from a bishop on c4 and the rook on the newly opened f-file. Of course, Black has something to say about these grandiose plans. In the King's Gambit Declined with 2 ... .tc5 we see that the a7-gl di agonal has been ceded, making castling diffi cult. We shall look at that in detail, because it expresses some common ideas and illustrates the dynamic imbalance that the King's Gambit can still give rise to. Varied problems occur after the most fre quently played move 2 ...exf4, called the King's Gambit Accepted. It's interesting that when he accepts the pawn, Black's defences all seem to involve one or both of two moves: a) The advance ... g5. This protects the f4- pawn and claims a material advantage, with the additional benefit of blocking off the aforemen tioned f-file. The g-pawn can also advance fur ther to g4 (or be forced to advance), when it may win time by attacking a knight on f3 and has other possibilities including the common idea of ... f3, disturbing White's pawn-structure and introducing some tactical ideas if White opens lines by gxf3 and exposes his king. b) As might be expected, ...d5 is an ideal freeing move (as in almost all double e-pawn openings). In particular, after White plays exd5, this allows Black to place his knight on f6 with out being harassed by e5. It also frees the c8- bishop, gives the queen room, opens the often useful e-file, and gives Black a comfortable square for his king's bishop on d6, protecting the gambit pawn. That's quite a bit for one move, but naturally things don't go as smoothly as Black would have it either.
KING 'S GAMBIT 167
Now we'll look at two illustrative variations out of the many that have been thought up by both sides over the years. One is the main line of the King's Gambit Declined, the other the 'Modem Defence' to the King's Gambit Ac cepted. King's Gambit Declined
1 e4 e5 2 f4 i.cS (D)
If one wants to decline the King's Gambit, 2 ... i.c5 has to be the most logical way, taking over the critical g 1 -a7 diagonal and preventing White from castling. It certainly leads to com plicated and challenging play. A couple of other ways to forego acceptance are 2 ... tbc6 3 tbf3 f5 !? and 2 ... Wkh4+ 3 g3 Wke7, both plausible and requiring some preparation. Note that 2 ...tbf6?! 3 fxe5 tbxe4 4 tbf3 leaves Black's knight stranded in the middle of the board, as well as securing a central majority. In one game Black made the best of a bad situation by 4 ... tbg5 ! 5 d4 (5 c3 tbxf3+ 6 Wkxf3; 5 i.c4 ?? tbxf3+ 6 Wkxf3 Wkh4+ and ... Wkxc4) 5 ... tbxf3+ 6 Wkxf3 Wkh4+ 7 Wkf2 (to protect d4) 7 ... Wkxf2+ 8 @xf2 d6, when 9 exd6 ! i.xd6 1 0 tbc3 c6 (ver sus tZ'Bb5) 1 1 tbe4 i.c7 1 2 .td3 would have se cured White a small but persistent edge. 3 tZ'Bf3 Almost always played. For one thing, Black was threatening 3 ... .txgl 4 l:txgl Wkh4+ 5 g3 Wkxh2, and 3 fxe5?? Wkh4+ is a blunder of major proportions. 3 ... d6 This time White was threatening tbxe5, but 3 ... tbc6? doesn't protect the pawn due to 4 fxe5 tbxe5?? 5 tbxe5 WVh4+ 6 g3 Wkxe4+ 7 Wke2 Wkxhl 8 tbg6+ tbe7 9 tbxh8 and White will win. After 3 ...d6, White has two basic options, 4 tbc3 and 4 c3: Piece-Play 4 tbc3 tbf6 4 ... tbc6?! is an inaccurate move-order as it allows 5 i.b5 ! , when Black's centre is under pressure. 5 i.c4 White doesn't get mated after 5 fxe5 dxe5 6 tbxe5?! Wkd4! 7 tbd3 i.b6, but Black has a bind and very quick development for the pawn; e.g.,

.txe2 1 2 'it>xe2 O-O. 5 ••• tbc6 6 d3 .tg4 (

White still can't castle! But Black has to watch out too. For instance, an unfavourable pawn-structure follows 6 ... O-O? 7 f5 ! with the idea .tg5 or in some cases g4-g5. However, after the main continuation 6 ... .tg4, 7 f5?! is a mistake because 7 ... tbh5 ! threatens ... tbd4, and there is hardly a good way to re spond. White has at least two other candidates. I'll try to present the main ideas without even dreaming of covering the complicated theory associated with this position. 7 h3 Chigorin - Pillsbury Hastings I 895 A note on 7 tba4 follows the game.

Generally Black retreats his bishop to b6 but there seems to be another pos sible formation: 7 ...O-O 8 tbxc5 dxc5 (D). Here's a structure that you'll see in the Giuoco Piano and the Vienna Game as well. Black has good control of the centre; his dou bled c-pawns secure d4 and open up the d-file. Black can even get rid of White's c4-bishop in
KING 'S GAMBIT 169
most cases if he needs to. In return, White tem porarily has the two bishops, a good pawn structure and prospects of a kingside attack. It' s probably about even, but certainly worth a look by both sides. Renet offers the following line, full of many options: 9 O-O tbh5 1 0 h3 i.xf3 1 1 'ii xf3 tbxf4 1 2 i.xf4 tbd4!? 1 3 �5 !?

This could be a fascinat ing variation to look into. Central Expansion 4 c3 White simply goes for d4. This is instructive, as it illustrates themes of the ideal centre. 4 ••• tbf6 The whole game revolves around whether White's centre can be compromised. Because of this the alternative 4 ... i.b6 ! ? would be in triguing. The idea is to make a sort of prophy lactic semi-waiting move, because d4 won't come with a tempo on the bishop: 5 d4 (White still has to get castled, so this is necessary; 5 i.c4 tbc6 doesn't help) 5 ...exd4 6 cxd4 i.g4!

Black' s scheme reminds one of the Modern Defence in which the bishops precede the knights in attacking the same e4/d4/f4 centre ( 1 e4 g6 2 d4 i.g7 3 tbc3 d6 4 f4 c6 5 tbf3 .tg4, etc.). 7 i.e3 tbc6 (or 7 ... d5 ! ? 8 e5 tbe7 intending ... tbf5, a fascinating position with double-edged chances; Black's pieces will be well-placed but the b6-bishop could end up stuck) 8 i.b5 tbge7 9 tbc3 f5 1 0 h3 ( 1 0 e5? dxe5 1 1 fxe5 O-O and the e5-pawn hangs) 1 0. .. i.xf3 1 1 'i!Vxf3 fxe4 1 2 'i!Vxe4 d5.

1 e4 e5 2 f4 exf4
Black takes up the challenge and plays a move that has been studied for over 1 50 years.
1 70 MASTERING THE CHESS OPENINGS
At this point we have an important alterna tive, as well as our usual move-order discus sion. It begins with the move 2 ...d5 ! (or ' ? ' if, as Black, you would like to get to the Kieseritzky Gambit below) 3 exd5, and now 3 ... e4 (D) is the Falkbeer Counter-Gambit. Black's idea in the Falkbeer is to cramp White's development. White's extra pawn on d5 is not impressively-placed anyway. The prob lem is that the powerful pawn on e4 has trouble staying there after 4 d3 li:Jf6 5 dxe4 lt:Jxe4 6 li:Jf3, the old main line going 6 ... i.c5 7 Wke2 i.f5 8 li:Jc3 Wke7 9 i.e3 ! , when Black has never found a route to complete equality. The main idea is 9 ... i.xe3 10 Wkxe3 lt:Jxc3 1 1 Wkxe7+ <:J;;xe7 1 2 bxc3 i.xc2 1 3 <:J;;d2. This position has been ana lysed for some years and seems to favour White. But after 3 exd5, Black can also play 3 ... exf4! 4 li:Jf3 li:Jf6, when we have transposed into the Modem Line that Black may be hoping for (it is the variation analysed in this section). So 2 ...d5 might be reasonable after all. Notice that this order avoids 1 e4 e5 2 f4 exf4 3 i.c4 in the next note. 3 li:Jf3 There must be at least a thousand master games with 3 i.c4 (D), the Bishop's Gambit. It has been subject to lengthy analyses for well over a century. The old main line was 3 ...Wkh4+ 4 <:J;;fl, which offers White intriguing attacking chances beginning with 5 li:Jf3, and Black also enjoyed some brilliant attacks on White's vulnerable king. But 3 ... lt:Jf6 is a big problem for White: a) 4 e5 d5 ! is our familiar device in e-pawn openings. Then 5 i.b5+ i.d7 ! 6 exf6 i.xb5 7 lt:Jc3 i.a6 keeps White from castling and em ploys the two bishops effectively; for example,
8 d3 Wkxf6 9 li:Jxd5 Wke6+ 1 0 Wke2 <:J;;d7 ! and ev
erything is covered: l l li:Jxf4 Wkxe2+ 1 2 lt:Jgxe2 lt:Jc6. Black has some advantage because for one thing he can reorganize by ...b6 and ...i.b7 with powerful bishops. b) 4 lt:Jc3 c6!. In this position White has tried nearly every move, but after ...d5, he loses a key tempo. Later, when White plays d4 and captures with a piece on f4, he is left with a seri ous internal weakness on e3. You can check the theory (critically, please! ), but I don't believe that White ever gets full equality.
3. ..d5
The 'modem' way of treating the King's Gambit. But in fact, most contemporary players use 3 ...g5 (D), the venerable Kieseritzky De fence, to try to refute the King's Gambit. Everything gets very tactical and we'll pri marily concern ourselves with 3 ... d5, but I'll mention two noteworthy continuations after
KING 'S GAMBIT 1 71
3 ... g5 (again, a variation with thousands of games to its credit): a) 4 .tc4 g4 5 O-O gxf3 6 Wkxf3 is the time honoured Muzio Gambit, in which White sac rifices a whole piece for a dangerous attack against Black's exposed king. A line subject to much analysis goes 6 ... Wkf6 7 e5 Wkxe5 8 .txf7+ 'it>xf7 9 d4 with the idea 9 ...Wkxd4+ 1 0 .te3 (D). I show this merely to indicate how the old style King's Gambit was played. In a book pur porting to promote general understanding of openings, this picture of anarchy has to be re ferred to the specialists! b) A fairly important line seems to be 4 h4 g4 5 tbe5 tbf6 6 d4 d6 7 tbd3 tbxe4 8 .txf4 Wke7 9 .te2 tbc6 10 c3 .tf5 which hovers be tween equal and somewhat better for Black. 4 exd5 tbf6 (D) One of the main lines of the King's Gambit. Structurally it looks good for White, at least at first glance. He has a majority in the centre and queenside (even after the forward d-pawn dis appears). What's more, White's move 5 .tb5+ could further weaken Black' s pawns while rid ding himself of his only weak pawn. His natural plan will be to plunge forward with d4 and c4, securing free development. At the same time Black' s majority on the kingside is crippled, and his f4-pawn is subject to attack along an open file. He has no prospects of creating a passed pawn on that side of the board. But Black has one major advantage. White will have to (and want to) move his d-pawn at some point, but this creates an internal weakness on e3. If Black manages to keep his f-pawn, he can use that square to threaten White's position by, for example, ... l:te8 and ... tbg4. Even if White manages to win the f-pawn by .txf4, the exchange of that bishop only worsens the situa tion with respect to e3. Furthermore, White's only real chance for advantage (or even equal ity) is to advance his pawn to d4, since d3 ren ders his game too passive. The problem then is that the e4-square also becomes a weakness, making moves like ... .tf5 and ... tbe4 particu larly attractive. It's anybody's guess which side's advantages will be more important than the other's. Let's look at a game with sample lines in the notes: s .tbs+ M . Ginzburg - Zarnicki Villa Martelli 2002 This is the only continuation that really tests both sides. The others show why White should be in a bit of a hurry: a) 5 .tc4 tbxd5 6 .txd5 (or 6 O-O .te6) 6 ... Wkxd5 7 tbc3 Wke6+ 8 'it>f2 Wkb6+ 9 d4 .te6 is probably already better for Black, Fedorov Godena, Batumi Ech 2002. For years, Fedorov was the leading King's Gambit player among grandmasters. b) 5 c4? ! leads to typical developmental and positional problems after 5 ...c6! 6 dxc6 (6 d4 cxd5 7 .txf4 .tb4+ and White's interior central squares are vulnerable; e.g., 8 tZ'ibd2 O-O 9 .te2 dxc4 I 0 O-O b5 1 1 .tg5 { versus ... tbd5-e3 } 1 1 . .. .tb7 and Black can be happy) 6 ... tbxc6
(D).
We see this sort of position in several open ings. With Black's development and control of
1 72 MASTERING THE CHESS OPENINGS
d4. he must be better. Moves like ... i.c5, ...O-O, ... .l:te8 and ... i.g4 are too strong, but if White fights for the centre by 7 d4 (7 tt::l c3 i.c5), he runs into 7 ... i.b4+ 8 tt::l c3 i.g4 9 i.xf4 i.xf3 10 '6'xf3 tt::l xd4 1 1 �e3+ tt::l e6 with a substantial edge. c) 5 tt::l c3 tt::l xd5 6 tt::l xd5 �xd5 7 d4 i.e7 is very easy for Black. Notice White's troubles with his interior weaknesses: 8 c4 (probably not best) 8 ...�e4+ 9 i.e2 tt::l c6 l 0 O-O i.g4 1 1 i.d3 i.xf3 1 2 i.xe4 i.xdl 1 3 .l:txdl g5, re maining a pawn ahead. 5 •••c6 6 dxc6 tt::l xc6 7 d4 i.d6 ( D) It's even material at the moment. White is banking upon his potentially powerful central pawns (the one on d4 is passed). Black has thwarted the development of White's c l-bishop and has weaknesses on e4 and e3 to exploit.

11 tt::l c4 i.c7 12 i.d2 If White is reduced to this, he's in trouble. 12• ••�d5 13 tt::l a3 tt::l e4 Black stands better. The weaknesses on the e-file are hurting White. The 'Modem Defence' to the King's Gambit looks appealing for Black. Of course, there's al ways more to the story. It would be nice if White could figure out a way to bypass such technicalities and return to gambit play in the romantic spirit. 1 0 I ntroduction to the Semi-Open Games The Semi-Open Games are a disparate group of openings with few characteristics in common except that they immediately unbalance the play. Another unifying factor is that they all prepare to counter in some manner White's plan to cre ate a classic pawn-centre with 2 d4. It has been said that each of the openings under the 'Semi Open Games' rubric has to 'give something up' in order to fulfil its mission. The French De fence ( 1 e4 e6 2 d4 d5), for example, blocks in the c8-bishop. The Caro-Kann Defence ( 1 e4 c6 2 d4 d5) takes c6 away from Black's knight. The Alekhine Defence ( 1 e4 tt::l f6) loses a tempo to 2 e5 and fails to contest the centre. The Pirc Defence ( 1 e4 d6 2 d4 tt::l f6) gives White an ideal centre, and the Sicilian Defence (1 e4 c5) doesn't open lines along which Black's pieces can develop. None of this applies to l ... e5, so one could ar gue that in some sense that is the 'best' defence to 1 e4. But l ...e5 makes its own concession in that Black's e-pawn becomes an unprotected target of attack. Furthermore, if we look at the other Semi-Open Games listed above, all of them except one attack White's centre pawn at e4, as can be seen from 1 e4 e6 2 d4 d5, 1 e4 c6
2 d4 d5, 1 e4 tt::l
f6, 1 e4 d5 and 1 e4 d6 2 d4 tt::l f6. In the case of the Alekhine ( l e4 tt::l f6) and the Scandinavian ( 1 e4 d5), the fact that White will effectively gain a tempo by 2 e5 and 2 exd5, re spectively, gives the counterattack an ambigu ous character, but Black nevertheless creates an imbalance that he fails to bring about by play ing 1 .. .e5. The Sicilian Defence goes its own way, as usual, neither developing nor attacking. What an irony that it's the favourite move of the best players in the world! Since the chapter introductions cover the ba sics strategies (and the games much more so), I won't repeat what's said there. Still, it might be interesting to make a few general comparisons between apparently similar openings before turning to the practical material. First, it should be clear that the Caro-Kann would be a better defence than the French if the disadvantages mentioned above were their only problem. Af ter all, bringing a bishop out freely as Black does in the Caro-Kann contrasts dramatically with Black' s imprisoned bishop on c8 in the French. It overshadows any other developmen tal problem. In the Caro-Kann, limiting the op tions of the b8-knight (i.e., preventing it from occupying c6) doesn't seem that severe a pen alty. In the abstract, a hypothetical knight might be best off on c6; but in this particular opening that piece will generally be happy on d7, con trolling e5 and defending f6 in key situations. And in the main line with ... i.f5 the knight doesn't even temporarily block Black's light squared bishop from developing. Of course, the availability of c6 for a knight in the French De fence shouldn' t be underestimated, not only be cause a knight there attacks d4 and e5, but because d7 is left free for a bishop or for a knight retreating to d7 after White plays e5 (a major sequence in the French). So the trade-offs between the two openings aren't completely one-sided, but if forced to compare, you feel that Black gets the better bargain by playing the Caro-Kann. However, what evens the scales is the respective central situations of the two open ings. Regardless of whether you play ...dxe4 (as in the main lines of the Caro-Kann) or maintain your pawn on d5 (as is the case in most varia tions of the French), it' s unlikely that you'll be able to attack White' s d4-pawn by means of ...e5 ; White can put a knight on f3, a bishop on f4, a queen or rook on the e-file, etc. So the re maining way to attack the centre and free one's pieces is ... c5. Black plays that move in most variations of the French Defence, truly threat ening to liquidate White' s centre. But in the
1 74 MASTERING THE CHESS OPENINGS
Caro-Kann Defence, playing ...c5 would cost Black a full tempo (i.e. ...c6-c5). For that rea son, the Caro-Kann defender will generally delay or forego ...c5 and count upon the re straining influence of his pawn on c6. That is the right decision ( ...c5 on an early move is usu ally impractical anyway); nevertheless, it' s al most always better to break up the opponent' s centre than to surrender the centre yourself. In the Caro-Kann, Black does gain counterplay against White' s centre along the open d-file, but that is relatively easy to fend off. So both open ings have their appealing and unappealing sides. The Alekhine Defence makes a funny con trast with the Pirc Defence. In the Pirc, Black plays ... d6 first, to restrain White's centre, and then ... tt::l f6 to attack it. In the Alekhine, Black reverses this order, playing ... tt::l f6 first, losing a tempo, and then within a few moves after e5 he plays ... d6. It's as though Black had allowed White to play e5 successfully against the Pirc, an advance that is Black's top priority to prevent! Thus one's first instinct is that the Pirc is a supe rior opening. It may or may not be, but the flaw in this argument can be stated more or less as follows: in the Pirc, White often shouldn 't play e5 because Black will either capture once and then retreat the knight, or retreat without cap ture, in both cases undermining the centre by ...c5 or if appropriate ...f6. In the case of the Alekhine, Black has got White to commit his pawn to e5 from where he is already in a position to undermine it. So in a way, he has achieved the Pirc player's dream! Well, of course it's not at all clear whether Black can undermine White' s e-pawn Pirc-style. But the point is that h e has an extended centre to attack whereas in the Pirc Black is waiting for that opportunity. Again, there are advantages and disadvantages to each approach. Most strong players would probably worry more about their space disadvantage were they to play one of these openings. Black's side of the Scandinavian variation 1 e4 d5 2 exd5 °iVxd5 with 3 tt::l c3 °iVa5 might be compared with the Centre Game for White af ter 1 e4 e5 2 d4 exd4 3 °iVxd4 tt::l c6 4 'iYa4. White has the extra move e4 in, but as with most reversed openings you have to decide whether that move is good or bad. The e4- pawn can be a target down an open file, fol lowing, for instance, . . . tt::l f6, ... i.c5 (or ...g6 and ... i.g7), ... O-O and ... .l:te8. On the other hand, the e4-pawn does guard d5 in classical fashion. Perhaps this one's a toss-up as well. One can make this kind of comparison be tween any number of positions in opening the ory, and it's a useful exercise to do so. The reader might want to think about other funda mental properties of Semi-Open Games and how they offer advantages or disadvantages. You will find that every defence has a balance between negatives and positives whose sum can't be too different from that of other open ings. Otherwise, some defences wouldn't be played at all, and others would find no willing opponents ! 1 1 Sici lian Defence l e4 c5 (D) The Sicilian Defence has been the most popular opening in top-level chess for the past several decades and continues to be so today, accounting for about 1 7% of all contests be tween grandmasters, and an astonishing 25% of the games in a database of Informators. Since young players and aspiring masters show such enthusiasm for the Sicilian, it's hard to see those figures diminishing much. What's so special about this opening? First of all, 1 .. .c5 effectively prevents 2 d4, the pri mary goal of a defence to 1 e4. To be more spe cific, 2 d4 cxd4 3 'iVxd4 loses a tempo and already risks disadvantage after 3 . . . tt::l c6. If, in stead, White plays 3 c3 and sacrifices a pawn (the Morra Gambit), we have many years of experience and analysis to show that Black at the very least should have no problems equal izing and almost certainly should gain an ad vantage with accurate play. Of course other openings also discourage d4 or prepare to meet it effectively, so we have to look for more rea sons to choose specifically the Sicilian De fence. Since the vast majority of games are contested in the Open Sicilian, i.e. 2 tt::l f3 and 3 d4, let's see what we can learn from the result ing positions. We need a concrete example to think about, so let's start with the most popular Sicilian Defence played by masters, the Naj dorf Variation: 2 tt::l f3 d6 3 d4 cxd4 4 tt::l xd4 tt::l f6 5 tt::l c3 a6

What's going on? Can Black really get away with this 4th pawn move, when it's not even a centre pawn? Let's make some more sample moves: 6 i.gS e6 7 f4 i.e7 8 °iVf3 'iYc7 9 O-O-O tt::l bd7 10 i.d3 bS 11 l':thel (

White has all seven pieces developed, Black just four, having made six pawn moves thus far. Furthermore, Black has only one piece beyond the second rank; White has five. And of course
1 76 MASTERING THE CHESS OPENINGS
White commands more space. Before comment ing upon all this, let's compare it with the Sozin Variation ofthe Najdorf. After 1 e4 c5 2 tt::l f3 d6
3 d4 cxd4 4 tt::l
xd4 tt::l f6 5 tt::l c3 a6, White contin ues 6 i.c4 e6 7 i.b3 i.e7 8 O-O b5 9 i.e3. In that case, White has five pieces out to Black' s two. A traditional Scheveningen/Najdorf line goes 6 i.e3 e6 7 i.e2 i.e7 8 O-O (D). In this case, White has five pieces out to Black's two, and out of seven moves Black has played five with pawns. Just to drive the point home, Black some times plays an even more extreme version of these ideas, namely, 1 e4 c5 2 tt::l f3 e6 3 d4 cxd4 4 tt::l xd4 a6 5 tt::l c3 d6 6 i.e3 b5, which adds up to six straight pawn moves and not even a piece out! You should notice another negative aspect of every one of these lines, as if they need it: Black's centre pawns on e6 and d6 are in passive positions blocking his own pieces, as third-rank pawns are known to do. Thus his pieces have few prospects of being as active as White's. As we shall see, the same thing is true of most other Sicilian systems. Back to our question: why then would any one, much less the world's elite, play the Sicil ian Defence? Well, Black has an open c-file. But wait! White has an open d-file attacking a weak pawn on d6. That should be even more effective. How about Black's minority attack with the pawn advance ...b5? OK, at least that's a real plus (unfortunately at the cost of more time taken away from development); but if he wants to, White has the time to stop that move by playing a4. In many cases this reduces Black to developing by ...b6 and ... i.b7, thereby put ting another pawn on the third rank. Any experienced player knows that Black stands reasonably well in these positions. Again, can we say why? The real key to the Open Sicil ian is that Black has a central majority. A cen tral majority is a basic positional advantage that should never be underestimated and can com pensate for other problems in the position. If we consider the centre with ... d6 and ...e6, Black's d- and e-pawns protect against incursions by white pieces, thus giving Black time to catch up in development. Next, every central majority threatens to advance and this one is no differ ent: once Black's pieces begin to get developed, the move ... d5 will expand the scope of some of them (for example, a bishop on e7, queen on c7 and a rook on d8 or e8), and create good posts for others (e.g., a knight on e4 or d5). Because White has to be constantly on the lookout for this move (as well as ...e5 followed by ...d5 on the next move) he has to devote forces to its pre vention. That brings us to another important ad vantage for Black in almost all Open Sicilians: White's e-pawn is a target. It can be attacked by a knight on f6, a bishop on b7, and perhaps an other knight on c5. White can defend his e-pawn with his light-squared bishop, but where should he put it? If the bishop goes to d3, it is blocked by its own pawn, and if it goes to g2 or f3, then the bishop will also be passively defending. In fact, in both of these positions Black may at some point be able to play ...e5 and fix the e pawn, preventing that bishop from getting out. What does this all translate to? White's light squared bishop is by definition a bad bishop, be cause his centre pawn is on a light square. I once heard the great Larsen say that after 3 d4 cxd4 White was positionally lost! Tongue-in-cheek or not, he was undoubtedly referring to Black's central majority, and the diversion of White's re sources to the defence of his e-pawn. What can White do in the face of these problems? He generally doesn't want to wait around for an ending without changing the pawn-structure, lest Black's central majority and queenside minority attack become too in fluential in that stage of play. In order to make progress, White has to exploit his space advan tage (he almost always controls four ranks to Black's three, with the other disputed). Hence
SICILIAN DEFENCE 1 77
you will see that many encounters feature White' s advance e5, activating his bishop and other pieces to gain serious and sometimes un stoppable attacking chances. A potential prob lem in that case is that the e5-pawn will become weak, so this decision has to be undertaken cau tiously. He can also turn to the advance f4-f5, hoping to force ...e5; sometimes, however, that cedes the e5-square to Black' s pieces - as al ways, proper timing is the key. Another attack ing option at White's disposal is g4-g5, perhaps in conjunction with h4, risking kingside expo sure in order to drive back Black's pieces. That has been an increasingly popular and successful strategy over the last decade. Finally, in addition to all those ideas, White can try to take direct ad vantage of Black's slow development and re fined pawn-play to sacrifice material and blow open the enemy position. His knights on c3 and d4 may be restricted by Black's pawns, but those same knights are habitually sacrificed on the squares d5, f5, b5 and e6. A completely different structure arises when Black has a pawn on d6 and one on e5. That would seem worse than the ...d6/ ...e6 systems, because he gives up the d5-square to White's pieces (and the f5-square can be handy for a knight). Let's see the best-known early version of this structure: 1 e4 c5 2 tt::l f3 d6 3 d4 cxd4 4 tt::l xd4 tt::l f6 5 tt::l c3 a6 6 i.e2 (6 i.e3 can also be answered by 6 ...e5, but that's another story) 6 ... e5 7 tt::l b3 i.e7 8 O-O O-O 9 i.e3. Both sides have played natural-looking moves and now Black illustrates a basic idea: 9 . . . i.e6 (D). This standard move contains the notion of playing ...d5 soon, totally freeing Black's game. White has plenty of options, but one is to oc cupy that square immediately. Then after 10 tt::l d5 i.xd5 ! ? (10. .. tt::l xe4? 1 1 i.b6 and 12 lbc7) 1 1 exd5, White has two bishops but has lost his outpost. More importantly, Black now has a mobile central pawn-mass. One encounter pro ceeded 1 1 ...tt::l bd7 12 c4 a5 1 3 tt::l d2 tt::l e8 14 f3 i.g5 15 i.f2 f5 and Black's 4:3 kingside major ity (a variant of the one we see in so many open ings) establishes itself. Black appears to have achieved a game with equal chances. Note that White' s bishop on e2 is still bad. Obviously one of the most complicated openings in chess can't be boiled down to a couple of generalities, but such themes will appear along with a multi tude of others that directly or indirectly stem from the basic properties of the opening. Before moving on to concrete variations, let me refer again to the very abbreviated descrip tion that I gave in the introductory chapters re garding the evolution of the Sicilian Defence. I'll expand upon it in certain particulars, but the point is the same. In the second half of the 19th century, players met the Sicilian with 2 tt::l c3 more than any individual variation (2 f4 was also a big favourite). When White played a line of the Open Sicilian (i.e., 2 tt::l f3 and 3 d4), Black responded primarily with the Pin Varia tion (2 tt::l f3 e6 3 d4 cxd4 4 tt::l xd4 tt::l f6 5 tt::l c3 i.b4) or the similar Four Knights Variation (2 tt::l f3 e6 3 d4 cxd4 4 tt::l xd4 tt::l f6 5 tt::l c3 tt::l c6), as suming that White let him get that far. Notice that both of those variations have the primary goal of rapid development, and bear little resem blance to the modem set-ups ...d6/ .. .e6/ ...a6 or ...d6/ ...e5, with pieces generally constrained to the second and third ranks. A few players ex perimented with such systems, such as Louis Paulsen. Among top players, he had to be the most devoted Sicilian player of his time and his games included everything from the Schev eningen to ... the Paulsen! The latter variation is truly hypermodem: 1 e4 c5 2 tt::l f3 e6 3 d4 cxd4 4 tt::l xd4 a6. In the first part of the 20th century, leading players began to investigate more Sicilian De fences with limited success, and in particular we see more Open Sicilians, including the Dragon Variation and to a limited extent the Schev eningen Variation. But the Sicilian only began to be truly accepted as a leading defence in the

1 930s, and it took off in the 1 940s. The popu larity of 1 . . .c5 hasn't stopped growing since, turning ever more modern as it evolved. V aria tions featuring fast development for Black are now proportionally rare.

By bringing out his knight White contests d4, but he also prevents ...e5, a move that might come in handy for Black. 2 tt::l f3 intro duces White's Open Sicilian variations, those in which he plays 3 d4, and after Black's re sponse 3 .. . cxd4, recaptures with 4 tt::l xd4. These variations constitute about 90% of master games with 1 ...c5. I shall group them according to Black's second move in so far as it is useful to do so. Introduction to Systems with 2 . . . d6
1 e4 c5 2 tt::l
f3 d6 3 d4 As so often, the less frequently played varia tions say something about the main lines, i.e. why they are the main lines. Here are some al ternatives to 3 d4 and a few move-order issues to think about. a) 3 .tb5+ ( D) is called the Moscow Varia tion. It has its followers, in part because some players don't want to enter into all the compli cations that arise from the Dragon, Najdorf and Classical Variations that we shall be looking at. If one simply judges by appearances, there doesn't seem to be anything wrong with 3 .tb5+. It gets the bishop out of the way to speed up White' s development, especially cas tling. If the bishop is exchanged, that may be of benefit to White because, as we have seen, his light-squared bishop can be a problem in the Si cilian Defence; formally speaking, it' s a bad bishop whether or not White follows up with c4 (a common Moscow Variation theme). This is all true and indeed 3 .tb5+ can hardly be a bad move. Certain specialists have done well with it at the highest levels. Yet the large majority of players prefer to use the Open variations with 3 d4. The achievement of positive prospects is the main reason behind their decision. In the Open variations of the Sicilian Defence, White tends to get a healthy lead in development and space. But after 3 .tb5+, an exchange of this bishop on d7 will bring out another of Black' s pieces and let him begin to catch up in devel opment. If Black plays 3 ... tt::l c6, White' s only threat is to cede his bishop-pair. That said, a number of Black' s set-ups offer White good chances for advantage, so the defender should know his theory and/or be a good intuitive player. We won't analyse the Moscow in depth because there is so much to explore elsewhere. In the broadest possible terms, and glossing over many options, the most frequently-played lines and ideas are as follows: al) 3 ... .td7 4 .txd7+ �xd7 (after 4 ... tt::l xd7,
5 d4 gives White some useful space, or he can
play 5 c4, although neither course guarantees an advantage) 5 c4 (D). The idea is to set up a Maroczy Bind with out White's light-squared bishop, which in the original Maroczy Bind (see the Accelerated Fianchetto Sicilian) tends to be a bad piece

imprisoned behind its own centre pawns. Cas tling kingside, d4 and b3 are all in the mix with a number of tricky move-orders. Needless to say, Black can generate counterplay in the cen tre either by targeting d4 with ...g6 and ... .i.g7, or by playing ... tt::l c6, ... tt::l f6 and ... e6. He can also play ...a6 and aim for ... b5, much as in the Accelerated Fianchetto lines. The very absence of White' s light-squared bishop will make this easier to achieve. a2) 3 ... tt::l d7 4 d4 cxd4 5 'iVxd4 leaves White better developed and well centralized. The moves tt::l c3 and .i.g5 can follow. Black has dif ficulty getting developed without allowing a fa vourable e5 at some point, so he usually plays ...e5 and brings his pieces out via ... tt::l f6 and ... .i.e7, probably followed by ... tt::l c5. This is very 'Najdorf-like' , absolutely legitimate, and not easy to talk about without specific exam ples. a3) 3 ... tt::l c6 4 O-O (4 d4 cxd4 5 'iVxd4 trans poses to 2 ... d6 3 d4 cxd4 4 'iVxd4 tt::l c6 5 ilb5, thus giving that intriguing system added signif icance; we'll look at it immediately below via the latter order) 4 ... .i.d7 5 .l:tel tt::l f6 6 c3 a6 7 .ifl .i.g4 8 d3 and White plans tt::l bd2 and h3. In general Black is equal as long as he is able to respond to d4 aggressively. b) White can always play a move such as 3 .i.c4. Ordinarily anything of this nature can be met by ... tt::l c6, ... g6 and ... .i.g7. Then, because of the bishop's position, ...e6, ...tt::l ge7 with ... d5 in short order will gain space and time; ...a6 is also a useful move. However, Black may not like that structure and can set up by 3 ... tt::l f6 4 d3 ( 4 e5 dxe5 5 tt::l xe5 is the sort of thing that wor - ries less experienced players but after 5 ...e6 it transpires that Black controls the d4-square. and without being able to play d4 White has lit tle chance of making progress; Black simply castles and exchanges off the forward knight) 4 ...e6 with the idea of ... .i.e7, ...

180 MASTERING THE CHESS OPENINGS
A thought-provoking situation has arisen, pit ting White' s knights, space, and superior devel opment against Black' s bishop-pair and central majority. The general rule with knights is that their owner needs to hurry to achieve an attack or gain outposts before his opponent consoli dates. Otherwise there will come a counterat tack on the queenside (in this situation by ...b5) and/or in the centre (by ...d5 or ...e5). Theory isn't particularly extensive on these lines and they afford a lot of scope for creativity. One ex ample that panned out well for Black was 1 1 @bl h6 1 2 i.h4 :es (Black must always be wary of some variant of the trick 1 2. .. °iVa5 1 3 °iVd2 :acS?! 1 4 tt::l d5 ! °iVdS 1 5 tt::l xe7+ 'iYxe7 1 6 tt:Jd4 with space and a simple advantage, be cause l 6 ... g5? 1 7 i.xg5 hxg5 l S 'iVxg5+ is kill ing) 1 3 i.g3 (this is probably attempting to avoid the standard idea 1 3 °iVd2 tt::l xe4 14 tt::l xe4 i.xh4 1 5 tt::l xd6 when Black can play 1 5. ..:rs or l 5 ... i.xf3 1 6 gxf3 :rs; but here we have a good example of the unexplored nature of this varia tion; White could just play 1 3 °iVd3 ! ?, when, for instance, 1 3. .. d5 1 4 i.xf6 i.xf6 1 5 e5 i.e7 1 6 lbd4 :cs 1 7 f4 i s promising; also possible i s 1 3 h3 !? with the idea g4, as was actually played in one game) 1 3. .. d5 ! 1 4 e5 (compare the last note - here White's bishop on g3 is just bad) 1 4. .. lbe4 1 5 tt::l xe4 dxe4 1 6 °iVxdS :exdS 1 7 tt::l d4 (D ). 1 7. .. i.eS !

The alternative 5 f3 ! ? has been played infre quently and yet without disappearing over the years. White's idea is to avoid blocking his c pawn by 5 tt::l c3 and thus be able to play c4, be fore or after i.b5+. Black's principled response to this plan is 5 ...e5 ! (D). This is our first example of the ...d6/. ..e5 structure. If Black makes conventional devel oping moves he can be tied down by c4 again; that's not the end of the world but not what most players want.

We now return to 5 tt::l c3 (D): After 5 tt::l c3, we have finally arrived at a great dividing point in Sicilian Defence theory, and will proceed to the main variations with 2 ... d6. Dragon Variation
1 e4 c5 2 tt::l
f3 d6 3 d4 cxd4 4 tt::l xd4 tt::l f6 5 tt::l c3 g6 (D) The Sicilian Dragon is one of the oldest forms of the Open Sicilian. Black gets his pieces out, especially the long-ranging bishop on g7. and can castle early without creating any pawn weaknesses. His next moves are traditionally ... ii.. g7, ...
O-O, ...
tt::l c6 and perhaps ... ii.. d7 (or ... ii.. e6) with ... .l:tc8 next. Thus Black activates his pieces rather quickly, especially by compar ison with most other Sicilian Defences. He can attack on the queenside by, say, ...a5-a4, or ...a6/. .. b5, in part because the g7-bishop exerts so much pressure in that direction. What are the problems in Black's position? Perhaps pawn-structure should be the first topic of discussion. It's true that Black's important central pawn on d6 is well defended by its neighbour on e7, unlike the queen's pawn in the ...d6/ ...e6 structures which distinguish so many Sicilian systems. We might also compare varia tions beginning with 1 e4 c5 2 tt::l f3 e6 3 d4 cxd4 4 tt::l xd4, when there is an immediate weakness down the open file on d6, whether or not it is occupied by a pawn. At least at first sight that difference favours the Dragon, and should be worth something. But as in so many openings, every advantage carries with it some disadvan tage. In this situation a white knight can land on d5 at the right moment and disturb Black's game. For instance, if White is attacking Black·s king on g8, the move tt::l d5 might eliminate the king's best defender. Or in a more positional setting, White's tt::l d5 might force an exchange on that square that results in open lines for White's pieces. Then there's the question of what Black can do with his central majority. normally his biggest asset in the Sicilian De fence. Obviously ...e6 is risky, because the d6- pawn could be very weak, in contrast to the nor mal Sicilian lines where Black's bishop de fends it from e7. And ... e5, the other typical Sicilian advance, will block the g7-bishop if Black isn't careful. Naturally both of those pawn advances can be played under the right circumstances, but they certainly aren't major themes. This means that Black's main central break is ...d5, which White will do his utmost to prevent. Assuming that White is successful in doing so, Black will be using pieces more than pawns to achieve his goals. Indeed, once we see the typical positions from either the Classical or Yugoslav Dragon we shall focus on piece- play on the queenside such as ... .l:tc8, ... ii.. e6-c4, ... tt::l e5-c4, ... �a5, ... tt::l d7-c5, ... .l:txc3, etc. In
182 MASTERING THE CHESS OPENINGS
the most frequently played system, the Yugo slav Attack, the players castle on opposite sides of the board and it's interesting to see the prior ity that White's pawns take in the attack (g4, h4-h5, f4-f5, etc.). This can be compared to Black' s queenside pawns, which often stay at home until his attack is complete. Finally, before leaving the subject of pawn-structure, there' s the simplest factor o f all: the g6-pawn offers a target for attack, in particular by h4-h5. In other Sicilian Defence variations, White may achieve an attacking advance such as g4-g5 (or a posi tional one like a4-a5) but there' s no specific pawn target. As usual, these various structural issues tend to balance out; if they didn't, no one would play the Dragon! I won't indulge in any more generalities, considering that the Dragon quickly breaks up into numerous variations that superficially have little in common with each other. It' s better to glean the ideas from the play itself. Classical Dragon

A famous contest that is often cited versus this move-order was Daniliuk-Malakhov, Russian Ch (Elista) 1 995: 9 lbb3 .te6 I 0 f4 �c8 1 1 f5 ! ? (winning a tempo but ceding e5) I l .. ..td7 1 2 g4?!

Although the e4-pawn is protected, White's weaknesses (pawns on e4 and c3, and the in ternal weakness on e3) make it impossible to keep things under control: 1 5 .tf3 tbxf3+ 1 6 'iVxf3 d5 ! (White's kingside is exposed and Black has an active bishop-pair) 1 7 .td4 ( 1 7 e5 d4 1 8 'iVe2 dxe3 1 9 exf6 .txf6 20 'iVxe3 'iVd5 ! ) 1 7. .. dxe4 1 8 'iVh3 tbxg4! 1 9 .txg7 (White is paying the price for f4-f5 and g4; 19 'iVxg4 .txd4+ 20 cxd4 'iVxd4+ leaves no defence) I 9 ...@xg7 20 tbxe4 (20 lbb3 tbe5 !) 20 ... 'iVb6+ 2 1 tbf2 gxf5 . Black is not just threatening ... �g8 with a mating attack; he has regained his material. This kind of thing has happened to White a lot, and perhaps explains why the Yugoslav with O-O-O is so popular: White can push all of his kingside pawns without his king being exposed.

8 tt:Jb3 This strange-looking move is almost always played in the Classical Dragon, in part out of necessity. First and foremost it prevents ...d5 (Black's most important freeing advance), which is difficult to stop otherwise. It also cov ers the a5-square (often used by Black's queen or knight) and supports the advance a4-a5 .
SICILIAN DEFENCE 183
Furthermore, 8 lbb3 protects the knight from tricky ideas involving ... tbg4 or ...�6. Natu rally, there are also drawbacks to this retreat. The main one by far is that on d4 the knight reaches more squares and is more effective for positive purposes. In fact, after securing his po sition against ...d5, White will often return the knight to d4. Beyond that consideration, on b3 the knight is vulnerable to ...a5-a4 and if White blocks this advance by a4, the move ... .llxb3 can be productive in some (but certain! y not all) positions. Note that after 8 .lle3 tbc6, 9 lbb3 will gen erally transpose, but 9 f4? ! allows the tricky 9 ... 'iVb6!, when Black's threats of ... tbxe4 and . . . 'iVxb2 tum out to be difficult to meet. Al ways watch out for ... 'iVb6 in Dragon positions whether you're playing White or Black. 8 ••• tt:Jc6 (D) We'll spend a lot of time from this position because it shows so many ideas fundamental to any Sicilian Defence in which White castles kingside. This position appears with opposite colours in the ultra-popular 'Reversed Dragon' variation of the English Opening. The latter is used more by grandmasters as a reply to the English than any other single system! That adds weight to our coverage of the ideas and strate gies here. 9 .llgS It seems that most Dragon experts consider this the most interesting system. It brings the bishop to the most active square and prepares f4-f5, often followed by g4-g5 or a well-timed e5. This carries with it two problems: Black may get pressure along the a8-hl diagonal (us ing the exchange sacrifice ... �xc3 and ... .llc6, for example, as we saw above), and White's ad vance f5 gives away the critical e5-square. Both sides have chances. White can also play more safely with @hl and f4, perhaps with .llf3, or .lld3, or �el and .llfl, to protect the vulnerable e4-pawn. These instructive options and equally popu lar alternatives to 9 .llg5 show a plethora of standard Sicilian themes: a) 9 @hl .ll e6 10 f4 and then: al ) 10. ..�c8 (this is a fundamental position) 1 1 .llf3 .llc4! ?

This idea becomes more relevant after 7 .tc4 tbg4 8 .tbs+ ! ? (8 O-O tbxe3 9 fxe3 is bad, as might be expected; Black has a permanent outpost on eS that White simply won't be able to get around; e.g., 9 ...O-O 1 0 �f3 e6 1 1 l:.adl tbd7 1 2 lbdbS tbeS 1 3 �e2 tbxc4 1 4 �xc4 .teS, etc.) 8 ...@f8 9 O-O (9 .tgS h6 1 0 .th4 gS 1 1 .tg3 �b6!) 9 ... .teS ! 1 0 h3 tbxe3 1 1 fxe3 @g7 1 2 �f3 l:.f8 and Black's control of the eS-square gives him the better po sition.

O-O
7 ... tbc6 generally won't make much differ- ence (unless you're a 'Dragdorf' player who puts his knight on d7; this odd hybrid system has been moderately popular of late). If White prefers to play 8 .tc4 at this point (delaying �d2), then 8 ... �b6 should be answered by 9 .tbs threatening tbfS, which probably gives White a small edge. More fun is 9 tbfS �xb2 1 0 tbxg7+ @f8 1 1 tbdS tbxdS 1 2 .txdS with the dark squares and the bishop-pair in return for a pawn. 8 �d2 tbc6 (D) Since the freeing move ...dS is so vital, it's instructive to see what White might do if it is played right away, something that most players don't even consider. After 8 ...dS? ! it seems nec essary for White to respond aggressively ifhe is to gain the advantage, beginning with 9 eS tbe8
10 f4 f6. Then everything is fine for Black un
less White plays the critical 1 1 h4! ?, leading to an atypical attack: 1 1 .. .fxeS 1 2 fxeS .txeS 1 3 O-O-O! tbf6 1 4 tbf3 .txc3 l S �xc3 tbc6 1 6 .th6 l:.e8 ( 1 6. .. l:.f7 1 7 tbgS) 1 7 hS ! .tfS 1 8 hxg6 .txg6 1 9 l:.xdS lbb4 20 �xb4 tbxdS 2 1 �d4 tbf6 2 2 .tc4+ @h8 2 3 �f4 intending tbeS and Black's not in very good shape. After 8 ... tbc6, we have formally arrived at the Yugoslav Attack. Since 9 ...dS is a huge po sitional threat, White has only three major moves. I'll focus on the traditional main-line move: 9 .tc4 a) 9 O-O-O has less theory than 9 .tc4, which means only a few books' worth! Castling doesn't stop 9 ...d5 (indeed, it's the main line), even though that move allows White, after 1 0 exdS tbxd5 1 1 tbxc6 bxc6, to win a pawn by 1 2 tbxd5 cxdS 1 3 �xdS. Fortunately, Black can then play the clever 1 3. ..�c7! with good compensa tion, the first point being that after 14 �xa8 .tfS (threatening the queen and checkmate on c2) l S �xf8+ @xf8 Black recovers most of the material with an ongoing attack. Thus White usually plays 1 2 .td4, when the most combat ive continuation is 1 2. ..eS 1 3 .tcS (D). Now 1 3. .. .te6! 1 4 tbe4! l:.e8 l S h4! h6 1 6 g4 leads to all kinds of complications. Notice that White didn't take the rook by 1 4 .txf8; it turns out that 14 ...�xf8 (threatening ... .th6) gives Black wonderful play for the exchange due to his dark-square control and attack via ... l:.b8 and ...fS, sometimes mixed with ... �b4 or ... lbb4. This is a typical case of a bishop being worth as much or more than a rook until the players

reach a simplified position, assuming that White makes it that far. This is j ust the very briefest of introductions to 9 O-O-O. It's up to you to plunge into that ter ritory if you get the inclination. b) 9 g4 is played much less frequently. The idea is 9 ...d5? 1 0 g5, winning a pawn. Few Dragon aficionados use this line as White, how ever, primarily because of 9 ... Cl'Bxd4 1 0 .llxd4 .lle6 or the immediate 9 . . . .lle6 (D). The point of the latter move is that 1 0 Cl'Bxe6 fxe6 covers the key d5-square and opens the f file against the weak f-pawn. Black's basic ideas of attack along the c-file in conjunction with the g7-bishop are essentially the same, and in some cases it's convenient to have an escape-square on f7. After the natural 1 1 .ll c4, Black can play either 1 l ... �c8 followed by ... Cl'Be5 or l l ... d5 ! ? 1 2 exd5 Cl'Be5 1 3 .lle2 Cl'Bxd5 1 4 Cl'Bxd5 exd5 1 5 O-O-O e6. This i s a line you might want to look into as White and should definitely be aware of if you're playing Black. We now return to 9 .llc4 ( D ): We have arrived at the starting-point of one of the most analysed opening variations in chess, and quite possibly the most analysed. In 1 975 many of us believed that the Yugoslav Dragon was beginning to get 'analysed out'. but decades later theory is continuing to ex pand, with perhaps 200 times as much serious material having been played and analysed. Since the main variations are so tactical and so criti cal, you simply need to study in detail those that you have chosen. Authors of the many Dragon books and CDs are fond of saying that you can play even the main lines of this opening armed only with a firm grasp on the general ideas. In fact that would only be possible on a low level of play where you are more or less guaranteed that whomsoever you play will not know much theory. The simple fact is that the player who is familiar with a Dragon variation and knows it by heart will almost always beat the opponent who doesn't. For one thing, it took untold hours of home study and computer analysis to work out most of the Dragon positions that are now part of theory, so the knowledgeable player will benefit from the specific results of that work. On top of that, many of the best Dragon moves are counterintuitive and not the choice that you would make under time constraints. Con sequently the most practical solution for those who want to play the Dragon as Black or use the Yugoslav Attack as White is to find lines in which to specialize and/or require less work. At any rate, this book is not intended as a theoreti cal tome so I'll just present games that show a number of themes for both sides.
188 MASTERING THE CHESS OPENINGS
In many ways the Dragon has simpler basic ideas than most other Sicilian Defences, which contributes to its appeal. The Classical varia tions feature standard kingside set-ups for White and a limited group of queenside attacking schemes for Black. I have devoted space to it partly as a matter of practicality for the average player. In the Yugoslav Attack we find a set of fairly straightforward themes to become famil iar with. For White, one such motif is the primi tive h4-h5 to open the h-file, followed by ..th6, exchanging the bishop that defends the vulner able dark squares around the king. Then White proceeds to checkmate or otherwise overwhelm Black by hook or by crook, using thematic moves such as tbd5 and tbxf6, g4-g5 or what ever is at hand. Such is the barbaric stuff of tens of thousands of games. On a much less frequent but arguably more sophisticated level, White plays centralizing and prophylactic moves such as �bl and �he l , perhaps in conjunction with lDb3, ..td4 and either e5 or tbd5. Alternatively, playing Wbl and lbb3 by themselves is a way to batten down the hatches against Black's queen side attack. That may come in conjunction with the simplifying tbd5 . ..tg5 is a common move in many variations, increasingly popular as the years have gone by, and particularly against the ...h5 lines. This serves the purpose of threaten ing ..txf6 and tbd5 at some point, but also has the idea that strategies involving f4 and e5 have more chance of success. The bishop move can be beneficial in that if Black plays his standard ...lbe5-c4 manoeuvre, White may be able to slide the queen away, perhaps to e2, because capture by ... tbxe3 is no longer possible. As a general rule, neither side can lose their dark squared bishop without putting their position in peril, unless of course that happens via sacrifice or other forcing sequence. Obviously you have to play this variation for quite a while to understand or be helped by that characterization. What about Black? Instead of pawn-pushes such as h4-h5, he has the two seemingly unavoidable ideas of ... tbe5-c4, to rid White of one of his bishops, and ...�xc3. The latter exchange sacrifice can be played as part of a mating attack, or to set the stage for an all-out assault, or simply to weaken White's structure such that if the right endgame or queenless middlegame comes along, Black will be happy to enter into it. He can use his queen side attack by ... b5-b4 to chase White' s pieces from defence, and it is quite common to sacri fice that b-pawn in order to open queenside lines for the attack. There are numerous other ideas - too many, in fact, to explore here. Returning to 9 ..tc4, what specifically does it do? It puts the bishop on an aggressive diago nal, yes, but also stops ... d5. For this purpose White subjects himself to a time-consuming re treat in the face of c-file pressure and ... tbe5 or ... tba5, hoping that the bishop's defensive role on b3 (guarding a2, protecting the king from b file attack) will justify its exposure, even to the longer-term idea ... a5-a4. There is no way to explore all of the intricate theory of the entire attack, of course, so I'll show a few games and game excerpts. 9••• ..td7 Stefansson - Ward Reykjavik 1998 Black simply develops.

a6 (DJ Whereas the Dragon Variation may have the most appeal to the average player, the Naj dorf Sicilian has been the favourite opening of
SICILIAN DEFENCE 1 95
top-level players for many years now. Part of this was certainly the influence of World Cham pions Fischer and Kasparov, consistent devotees of the variation. There is also the inherent com plexity and diversity of the Najdorf concepts and themes, to some extent in contrast to the relatively straightforward ideas of the Sicilian Dragon. White has a large variety of absolutely independent systems available for choosing, and Black can respond with varying basic structures. The Najdorf has an especially fluid character: again in contrast to the Dragon, we see more central breaks to go along with flank attacks, and in most variations the centre ulti mately plays as large a role as the attacking for mations on either side of the board. What is that magical little move 5 ...a6 all about? First of all, flexibility, which is perhaps the most valuable asset in modem openings. As the move 4 ... a6 does in the Paulsen Sicilian ( 1 e4 c 5 2 lL'Bf3 e6 3 d4 cxd4 4 lL'Bxd4 a6), so Black's 5 ...a6 in the Najdorf makes an implicit challenge to his opponent. White has played five unexceptionable moves (e4, lL'Bf3, d4, lL'Bxd4 and lL'Bc3), which essentially tell Black nothing about what he is up to. But now it is time for White to commit one of his bishops, which by defining the play will allow Black to respond accordingly. The development of White's light squared bishop is particularly meaningful in that regard. If it goes to e2, then Black might play ... e5, which would not be highly recom mended in the Dragon or Taimanov Sicilians, for instance. If White's bishop ends up on c4, Black can block the bishop by ...e6, and so forth. Similarly, a dark-squared bishop on e3 or g5 will require different strategies from Black. For all that, 5 ...a6 is fundamentally slow and simply invites White to go on an offensive. Thus the Najdorf is a risky system in which the slightest inaccuracy can spell disaster. But as Kasparov says, 'High risks mean high rewards', adding that with the Najdorf, Black will usually get a chance to seize the initiative at some point. But he cautions that any generalizations about strategy need to be supported by thor ough homework. We shall investigate 6 .Bg5, 6 .Bc4, 6 .Be2 and 6 .Be3. The continuation 6 f4 is rare these days. One idea that demonstrates a basic Sicilian theme is 6 ...e5 7 lL'Bf3 lL'ibd7 8 a4 (versus ...b5) 8 ... .Be7 9 .Bd3 O-O 1 0 O-O (D). Now with 10 ... exf4!? Black strives to control the e5-square in return for d5. This is the quint essential Sicilian strategy, since it provides an outpost on e5 at the same time that it opens up the e-file and the h8-al diagonal i.n support of that square. But White gets something from the deal too: he gains the key d4-square (usually for a knight), gets an open f-file, and may be able to put pressure on d6 more effectively because of a bishop that occupies f4. These trade-offs have to be constantly evaluated when Black considers whether to play - and White considers whether to allow - the capture ...exf4. Of course Black has other moves which we won't elaborate upon here, notably 10 ... 'i:Vc7 and 1 0. .. lbc5. Af ter 1 0. .. exf4, White plays 1 1 @hl !

We see this structure in several Sicilian lines, and also in other openings where the move
196 MASTERING THE CHESS OPENINGS
.Bxe6 or ... .Bxe3 occurs, or even l2Jg5 and lLixe6. Black' s pawns protect the key central squares d5 and d4, as well as f5 and f4. In such positions the key questions are whether the pawns can be attacked (they are unsupported by other pawns) and who has the better pieces. Mainly because of the relative strengths of the bishops, I prefer Black. Of course this is just one example, not a verdict! The i.g5 Attack 6 .Bg5 White's predominant choice for years was this direct attacking line, and it is still the choice of many experts. White wants to play f4 fol lowed by pawn-breaks like e5 or f5 if allowed. Since Black usually prevents those, White's main set-up begins with 'i:Vf3 and O-O-O. We shall see the associated themes as we go along. In the meantime Black plays ...e6 followed by what are the most typical Najdorf moves ... l2Jbd7, ... 'i:Vc7, ...b5 and ....Bb7, usually but not always with an early ... .Be7. Again, the standard set-ups will ap pear with examples. 6 ... e6 7 f4 (D) This is the most direct attacking scheme that you will see in the Najdorf and has led to crazy sacrificial brilliancies for both sides for years. Three games will follow, and since the variations are so tactical and diverse, I shall lean towards recent examples and stay at least within shooting distance of current theory. Again, only specific study of concrete varia tions will let you truly master 6 .Bg5, whether White or Black. It should be said, however, that if you can pick up some of the ideas that repeat themselves you will have a good head- start. There are of course many ways in which the play can develop. Most of them have White ei ther attacking on the kingside or in the centre. In both cases he will resort to piece sacrifices whenever they are useful or necessary, because the pawns alone won't generally be enough to break down Black's position. Black has some interesting counterattacking ideas on the king side, but will usually proceed with a basic plan of development followed by central and queenside attacks. Or he can leap into action by playing the so-called Poisoned Pawn Variation and grabbing material. I'll outline these possi bilities in a few games.

200 MASTERING THE CHESS OPENINGS
f5. His other rook is already on an open file and after l:l'.b3 (with tempo!) it can swing along the third rank and attack where needed - this is a standard theme in many openings, by the way. Thus every white piece will be participating in an attack against an opponent with almost no pieces out and no safe place for his king. For Black, this is a sure recipe for disaster. Or is it? In fact, the Poisoned Pawn Variation has been taken seriously for well over four de cades now and has survived countless attempts to refute it. In the meantime, Black's outrageous pawn theft has played a considerable role in revolutionizing chess theory and practice. Under the leadership of World Champions Fischer and Kasparov, players began to realize that Black could play this and similar positions with every expectation of success. Why? There are several general answers, but three stand out: a) The queen on a3, although subject to fur ther attack, is also an attacking piece, able to tie White down to protecting his own position and prevent him from straying at will. Older theory would say (at least when the queen sortie is be ing contemplated) that most pawn raids with the queen would have to be accompanied by other retreating moves by her to get back to safety. But now there are plenty of situations in openings where a queen retains her position in the enemy camp, saves time, serves a useful function, and says 'Show me' . Computer anal ysis has assisted in finding new examples. b) Black has no weaknesses! White, on the other hand, has a problem that we often refer to in this book: internal weaknesses, espe cially those on the third rank. The main one here is on the c3-square, adjacent to the centre and unprotected by a pawn, and the central square e3 also qualifies. In addition, the fourth rank squares c4 and e4 tum out to be vulnera ble, especially significant since a white bishop on c4 would be loose. Even d4, although poten tially able to be protected by a pawn on c3, can be shaky in practice. In this variation, weak nesses tend to mean loose pieces and potential outposts for the enemy. c) Central pawn-majority. It cannot be over stressed what Black's strongest weapon is in the Sicilian Defence: his extra central pawn, which in the main line of the Poisoned Pawn Variation sometimes becomes a central pawn mass capable of giving exceptional protection to Black's king and pieces. Having said that, the most important point to remember is something that Kasparov eternally stresses: this variation depends upon specific tricks and tactics for both sides, and there is no overriding reason that White's attack shouldn 't win, nor that Black's defence shouldn't prevail; to a large extent the result is just the way things work out. We'll examine one game and a bundle of notes from the key position after 9 ... 'i:Va3. 10 f5! Thinius - Kersten Bad Zwesten 2006 The modem continuation.

Najdorf Sozin Attack
1 e4 c5 2 lbf3 d6 3 d4 cxd4 4 lbxd4 lbf6 5 lbc3
a6 6 ..ltc4 (D) The name 'Sozin' is connected with ..ltc4 in both the Najdorf and the Classical lines, so I'll designate 6 ..ltc4 as the Najdorf Sozin. Although this direct bishop development has never been as popular as 6 ..ltg5, and in these days not as popular as 6 ..lte3, it is still used successfully by loyal adherents. The play after 6 ..ltc4 divides into a set of positional and primarily tactical lines, so I'll treat it that way. It's probably fair to say that the slower lines tend to end up in equal ity or even in Black's favour because of his long-term advantages, but the more numerous dynamic lines are much harder to assess, with beautiful tactics seemingly the rule rather than the exception. Black almost always plays ...e6 (usually 6 ... e6) in order to restrict the scope of the c4- bishop. After that White has to be careful about the move ...d5 or ... lbxe4 followed by a ... d5 fork, so he will retreat his bishop to b3. That's the basic position from which strategies are formed, as we shall see. 6 •.•e6 / 6 ... lbxe4? walks into 7 'fih5 ! wiili multiple threats, when the best that Black can do is 7 ...d5 ! 8 ..ltxd5 lLid6. Then, however, White plays 9 O-O and Black has trouble getting his pieces out, since ...e6 is met by a capture on that square and ...g6 by 'fie5. Players often wonder why Black doesn't simply attack the bishop right away with the useful move 6 ...b5. One problem is that the b pawn advance is committal; since ...e6 will doubtless be played anyway, Black may not want White to know on what basis he will set up his attack. Velimirovic-Mrdja, Yugoslavia 1 984 went 7 ..ltb3 (7 ..itd5 ! ? is also very interesting

White's 10th move introduces a type of e-pawn sacrifice that has dozens of variants and forms. Sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't. The positional basis c ists of a lead in development, the opening of White's e-file, and Black's difficul ties in proceeding with his own development.

If White plays f4-f5 and Black responds with ...e5, the argument revolves around occupation of the d5-square. Should White succeed in exploiting it as a pure outpost, he will probably stand better. When Black can prevent a piece from establishing itself there or gain compensating advantages, his natural Sicilian attack on the queenside will usually come into play. The variations that top players such as Fischer en tered into (he played both sides of 6 ..ltc4) were primarily positional and revolved around these factors. As in many Najdorf variations, if White plays f4 and e5 (instead of f5) the game will often tum very tactical, and White may have to shift his strategy to piece sacrifices before his ad vanced central pawn falls. Those lines are very position-specific and exciting. Alternatively, White sometimes foregoes f4 altogether and simply brings his pieces out. This has become a very popular strategy, although it contradicts what for years was the conventional wisdom, i.e. that the b3-bishop ran into a brick wall at e6 and that it took pawn advances to remedy that. We'll follow various games from this posi tion. I'll show a lot of tactical ideas which are fairly universal in their character and apply elsewhere, but there will also be some purely unique and creative combining for your enjoy ment. Dynamic attacking play is what has al ways drawn the average player to the Najdorf Sozin. Morozevich - Agrest St Petersburg Z 1993 7 •.• ..lte7 8 f4 Other common continuations are 8 O-O and 8 ..lte3. 8 .•.b5!? This natural move allows a typical tactical se quence although Black is used to such things in the Najdorf. His main alternative is 8 ... O-O, when

Reutsky - Shtyrenkov Noiabrsk 2003 7 ... lbbd7 This development has been popular for some years, especially after Kasparov used it versus Short in their world championship match. The knight temporarily prevents e5, but generally it goes to c5 next, from which post it can protect e6 against f4-f5 and eliminate the b3-bishop when Black chooses to do so.

This was probably due to Fischer's example; he consistently employed the idea of f4-f5 to break down Black's e6/f7 structure. The logic was that the e6-pawn ren dered White's b3-bishop ineffectual, so it had to be eliminated. However, that strategy simply didn't succeed versus accurate play, so White finally turned to a different concept. Pieces can precede pawns in an attack as long as the two ul timately cooperate. The great Tai always seemed to bring his pieces out to active squares before organizing pawn-breaks, if indeed his opponent survived up to that point.

c3 a6 6 ..lte2 (D) As various systems have come in and out of fashion, this solid and unpretentious develop ment has always been there as a sensible alterna tive to the heavily theoretical attacking sys tems. The last world-class player to play it consistently with great success was Karpov, yet practically every major player has been on one or both sides of it. Kasparov played it at least four times versus major players with an idea that will be seen below. White's concept is sim ple, at least at first sight. He wants to develop and get castled without exposing his pieces to the tempo-gaining attacks that 6 ..ltg5, 6 ..ltc4 and 6 ..lte3 are often hit with. 6 ..lte2 also covers the g4-square against an invading knight and thus prepares to put a bishop on e3. While 6 ..lte2 is almost always associated with f4, the advance g4 has increasingly been used in con junction with it in order to drive away the f6- knight and prevent ... d5 before undertaking more aggressive action. The negative side of ..lte2 is fairly obvious: it is passive and creates no threats. Nor does the bishop protect the critical e-pawn, which indi cates that it will most likely end up on f3 or d3 at some point. Consequently, White's bishop will often take two moves to get to a relatively passive square. 6 ...e5 (D) Although Black can play 6 ...e6 and trans pose into another variation, this is the original 'point' of 5 ... a6. On the move before, 5 ... e5 would have been met by 6 ..ltb5+, creating some awkwardness on the light squares; for example, 6 ... ..ltd7 7 ..ltxd7+ li'xd7 8 ll'lf5, after which the knight will head for e3 in many situations, al ready with a complete grip on d5. None of this can occur once ...a6 is in. The move 6 ... e5 sets up one of the archetypal Sicilian structures. Black's idea will be to threaten ... d5 as soon as possible and force White to react in a way that is otherwise unfavourable. The analogous idea
SICIUAN DEFENCE 209
is Boleslavsky' s innovative 6 ...e5 after 5 ... lbc6 6 ..lte2 e5, a move that at first shocked the chess world because it gave up an outpost on the cru cial d5-square and also created a backward pawn on d6. Boleslavsky' s move is analysed in the section 'Sozin Attack (and the Classical Si cilian)' below. Note, by the way, that after 6 ..ltg5, 6 ... e5? would be a self-pin; and after 6 ..ltc4, 6 ... e5 fails to block off White's dangerous bishop. On the other hand 6 ..lte3 e5 is very common. I'll fit the variation 6 ..lte2 e5 into one game; please forgive the dense notes, which attempt to encompass the major ideas of the variation. 7 lbb3 Geller - Fischer Cura(:aO Ct 1962 Although knights on b3 are often poorly placed in the Sicilian, this retreat leaves the move f4 available to attack White's centre and kingside. It also supports the idea a4-a5, and has a defensive function by keeping an eye on c5 and potentially exchanging a knight on that square. We shall see that White's action in the 6 ..lte2 N ajdorf is very often on the queenside, in contrast to his main 6th-move alternatives. a) 7 lbf5 d5 ! exploits the white knight's hanging position to achieve Black's favourite freeing move. White can develop quickly and control d5 by 8 ..ltg5, but 8 ...d4 9 ..ltxf6 'fixf6 10 lbd5 'ii d8 gives Black a space advantage with easy development for Black's bishop-pair. He also has a handy break with ...g6 and ... f5 in store. b) 7 lbf3 is played reasonably often. White sometimes follows with the sequence of moves a4, O-O and lLid2-c4-e3, to reinforce control of d5, but that is obviously very slow. An exciting if speculative game continued 7 ... h6 (a good solu tion is 7 ... ..lte7! 8 ..ltg5 lbbd7 9 a4 O-O 1 0 O-O h6 1 1 ..ltxf6 lbxf6 1 2 ..ltc4 ..lte6, Van der Wiel Beliavsky, Wijk aan Zee 1 985) 8 ..ltc4!?

a6 6 ii.e3 (D) This move in conjunction with 7 f3 is known as the English Attack, which can be used against systems with or without ... lbc6. Here we look at Najdorf variations, primarily those that use ...e6 and skip ... lbc6 in favour of moves like ...b5, ... ii.b7, ... ii.e7 and ... 'ii c7. This is a hot line in contemporary chess and full of analysis going 20 moves or more, so my coverage will be lim ited. Nevertheless, the English Attack lines are full of interesting and original positional ideas that express a new way of playing the Sicilian Defence for both sides. These positional con siderations make it a good topic of study. The move-order 6 f3 with 7 ii.e3 is a way of transposing to the main English Attack without allowing ... lbg4. However, Black does have the move 6 ... 1Wh6! ? preventing 7 ii.e3 due to 7 ... 1Wxb2. This has the same idea as ... 1Wh6 in the Classical Sicilian, namely, to force the knight back to b3 even at the cost of a tempo ( ... 1Wh6-c7). Then if the knight returns to its 'best' square d4, it's Black who has gained the tempo. But with the knight remaining on b3 it's not so easy for Black; e.g., 7 lbb3 e6 8 g4! ? (8 1We2 intending ii.e3 is also played; perhaps 8 a4 is also good, since a5 can't be prevented) 8 ... lbc6 (Judit Polgar has played both 8 . . . 1Wc7 9 ii.e3 b5 and 8 ...tt:Jfd7; these both look like better ways to go) 9 'ii e2 1Wc7 I O ii.e3 b5 l l O-O-O with advantage. In view of White's many options against 6 ... 1Wb6, it looks as though 6 f3 is safe enough and avoids the ... lbg4 lines men tioned in the next note. 6 •••e6 Or: a) 6 ... tt:Jg4 7 ilg5 h6 8 ii.h4 g5 9 ilg3 ilg7 (D) has been the subject of many grandmaster games, notably Kasparov's. The idea is to take White's dark-squared bishop away from its most effective diagonal and use the e5-square productively. Still, Black has weakened his kingside and the variation seems to have fallen out of favour, so we won't be looking into it here. b) 6 ...e5 is the typical Najdorf solution that we saw under 6 ii.e2 e5. A unique idea is 7 lbf3 ! ? ii.e7 8 ii.c4, which resembles 6 ii.e2 e5 except for three things: 1 ) White generally would like to play ilg5 in lines with lbf3, so as to weaken Black's con trol of d5. But here White has already moved
SICILIAN DEFENCE 213
the bishop has to e3, so it would be a loss of tempo to bring it to g5. 2) White has gained a move by playing ii.c4 in one jump (instead of ii.e2-c4). Of course White may not want the bishop to be exposed so early to ...b5, but that doesn't seem to be much of a problem. 3) On a less important note, White's some times-useful manoeuvre of lbd2-c4-e3 (after a4) is no longer possible because both c4 and e3 are occupied. At any rate, after 8 ii.c4 play can continue 8 ...O-O 9 O-O ii.e6! ? 1 0 ii.b3 lbc6 1 1 ii.g5 (D).

time to get all of three moves in, that is, ...b5, ... lbfd7 and ... lbb6. Now 8 ... lbb6 9 g5 lbfd7 blocks ...b5, when both 1 0 a4 lbe5 1 1 f4 lbec4 1 2 ii.cl and 10 f4 (preventing ... lbe5) yield considerable advantages. After 8 g4, therefore, Black may as well play 8 ...h6 9 h4 (9 "fii d2 b5 ! gives Black the extra time he needs for a pro ductive transfer to the queenside and in fact transposes into the 'Main Line' of the English Attack, but 9 "fii e2! ? and O-O-O is definitely worth looking into) 9 ...b5 10 �gl ( 1 0 a4! is strong, with the idea 1 0. .. b4 1 1 lbc6 "fii c7 1 2 tt:Jxb4 d5 1 3 lbd3) 1 0. .. lbb6 (so Black has gained his tempo but at the cost ofloosening his position on both wings) 1 1 g5 lbfd7 (Wed berg-Akesson, brebro 2000) and again 1 2 a4! looks strong, intending 1 2. .. lbc4 1 3 ii.cl !, when Black has to do something about axb5, and White can respond to 1 3. .."fii a5 with 14 g6! lbde5 15 gxf7+ lbxf7 16 axb5 !

limiting White to a moderate advantage. Even if ...h5 doesn't appeal to you in this exact posi tion, you should be aware of it (as both Black and White) when playing or confronted with the many different versions of the f3/g4 attack. 8 g4 Although it's a complicated issue, it's proba bly better to toss in g4 first, before 'Yi'd2, because after 8 'Yi'd2 ll:ibd7 Black has more options, whereas 8 g4 ll:ibd7?! 9 g5 drives the knight away. 8 ... h6 For the reason given in the last note, this is needed if Black wants to play ... ll:ibd7. But 8 ... ll:ifd7 ! ? 9 'Yi'd2 ll:Bb6 (D) is an important and still viable alternative. As with so many Sicilian ideas, this is ini tially hard to believe: Black has made nine moves to get one piece out! And yet 8 ... ll:ifd7 and 9 ... ll:Bb6 has been played by many of the world's leading players including Kasparov. How can Black ignore the classical rules of development in this manner? The answers are several. Consider that Black saves the move ...h6 (played in the main line), thereby 'gain ing' a tempo and, crucially, keeping his king side without weaknesses. Thus White will have to play a lot more moves (such as g5, h4, h5 and g6) in order to make contact with the enemy king (which normally castles kingside). Sec ondly, if attacked by ... b4, White will not be able to play ll:Ba4 as he does in many lines. This can speed up Black' s attack, especially since ll:ice2 can be met by ... ll:Bc4. So White is re duced to ll:ib 1 in most cases. To be fair, ll:ib 1 is a good enough answer in most cases but it's not White's first choice. Finally, the ... ll:ifd7-b6 manoeuvre allows for a very harmonious de velopment by Black involving ... ii.b7, ... ll:ibd7 and ...�c8. This is also one of the few lines in which an early ... d5 is feasible, because the usual problems of g5 and e5 (with tempo) are not present. On the flip side, White has five aggressively placed pieces and a large space advantage, both in the centre and on the kingside. His e4-pawn, usually a target of attack in the Sicilian, is dou bly supported and not yet threatened. Imagine being unhappy with that!

is an important yet funny line. Now Black has no space, no pieces out after 1 2 moves, and his a-pawn is isolated ! This posi tion is a tribute to the central pawn-majority and the ...d6/ ...e6 structure. It also provides evidence for a recurrent idea: that an isolated a-pawn on

lbf3 e6 (D) This advance of the e-pawn caught the atten tion of many early practitioners of the Sicilian Defence. Black threatens to challenge, if not take over, the centre by playing ...d5 next or within a few moves. The game as a whole takes on a different character with 2 ...e6 as opposed to 2 ...d6 or 2 ... lbc6. Naturally, it can transpose to the same lines and structures if an early ...d6 follows; but if not, Black has new options with respect to his development and overall strategy. One noteworthy difference with 2 ...e6 is that White has no ii.b5 option, as he does after 2 ... lbc6 and 2 ... d6. A few years back that might not have meant much, but ilb5 systems are in creasingly popular, and 2 tt:Jf3 lbc6 3 ii.b5 has even driven top-level grandmasters to change their preferred variations or at least their move orders. Another benefit has to do with the f8- bishop, which after 3 d4 cxd4 4 tt:Jxd4 is now free to go to various positions such as c5 and M; both carry the prospect of more confronta tional chess than, say, 2 ...d6 offers. We also see a lot of early queen moves; for example, to c7 and b6 without first playing ...d6. Needless to say, 2 ...e6 comes with some negatives. On a smaller scale, Black has less flexibility in meeting the moves 3 c3 and 3 d3. It should be added that these moves pose no serious threat; however, Black may not get to choose the variation with which he is most comfortable (see below). And ... e6 does weaken the d6-square, which is a drawback in a num ber of lines, especially those in which Black delays ...d6. Moves such as lbb5 and ii.f4 can be problems, and in general White's move e5 can have more force in many positions since it can't be captured by a pawn. Oddly enough, the fact that 2 ...e6 cuts off the path of the c8-bishop isn't of great consequence. Normally that bishop will attempt to go to b7 or if necessary take its place on d7, and these are the usual squares in other Sicilian variations as well. Taken as a whole, 2 ...e6 is neither better nor worse than the alternatives, as can be seen from its percentage scores in various lines. 3 d4 The alternatives are not threatening but both sides might want to look into 3 c3 and 3 d3. These moves are good study material in any case because the positions are of a standard nature:
SICILIAN DEFENCE 21 7
a) After 3 c3, Black has to decide which anti-c3 method to choose. It's important to know something about the move-orders, especially when compared to 1 e4 c5 2 c3, which is cov ered in the Alapin section of this chapter. A big difference is that after 2 c3, Black can play 2 ... d5 3 exd5 °Yi'xd5 4 d4 tt'Bf6 5 tt'Bf3 ilg4, a move that is no longer available when he plays 2 tt'Bf3 e6 3 c3 d5 4 exd5 °Yi'xd5 5 d4. Further more, in the main lines after 2 c3 tt'Bf6 3 e5 tt'Bd5
4 d4 cxd4 5 cxd4, Black retains the option of
...d6 without ... e6. That isn't true after 2 tt'Bf3 e6
3 c3 tt'Bf6 4 e5 tt'Bd5. Thus Black needs to oper
ate within a narrower range of systems, which have to be studied if one is to gain real under standing. I'll pursue just a few themes out of many: al) Several basic structures can arise from 3 ... tt'Bf6 4 e5 tt'Bd5 5 d4 cxd4 6 cxd4 d6, which Black has played with adequate results for many years. One idea is that he can forego the devel opment of his queen's knight until White's for mation is clear; e.g., 7 ilc4 tt'Bb6 and now 8 ii.d3 ! ? dxe5 9 dxe5 tt'Ba6 ! ? 1 0 O-O tt'Bc5 1 1 ii.c2 °Yi'xd l 1 2 �xdl ii.d7 1 3 tt'Bc3 l:: k8 with comfort able development, Shaw-Short, Catalan Bay
2003. If White plays 8 ii.b3 instead, Black has
8 ...dxe5 9 tt'Bxe5 (9 dxe5 °Yi'xd 1 + 1 0 ii.xd 1 tt'Ba6 ! and ... tt'Bc5 or ... tt'Bb4, another case in which de laying the development of the queen's knight is beneficial) 9 ... tt'Bc6 1 0 tt'Bxc6 bxc6 (D). Here we have a standard position from sev eral openings, with the backward c-pawn ver sus the isolated queen's pawn. Even if White were better developed than he is here, Black would have enough play by combining pressure down the b- and ct-files. In this position he can also liquidate the weaknesses and gain activity; for example, 1 1 O-O ii.e7 1 2 tt'Bc3 O-O 1 3 ii.c2 ii.a6 14 �el c5 1 5 dxc5 °Yi'xd l 1 6 �xdl ii.xc5, Blatny-Shaked, Kona 1 998. a2) The other obvious response to 3 c3 is 3 ... d5, when 4 exd5 can lead to two unrelated set-ups: a2 1 ) Upon 4 ... °Yi'xd5, we might get 5 d4 tt'Bf6 6 ii.d3 (6 ii.e2 tt'Bc6 7 ii.e3 cxd4 8 cxd4 ii.e7 9 tt'Bc3 °Yi'd6 transposes to one of the lines stem ming from 2 c3; it is considered harmless) 6 ... tt'Bc6 7 ii.e3 cxd4 8 cxd4 ii.e7 9 tt'Bc3 °Yi'd6 with analogous ideas to lines versus 2 c3; again, refer to the Alapin section. Of course there are options on every move. a22) Black can also play 4 ... exd5 5 d4 tt'Bc6, when an isolated queen's pawn position can easily follow: a22 l ) 6 ilb5 ii.d6 7 dxc5 ii.xc5 8 O-O tt'ige7 9 tt'ibd2 O-O 10 tt'Bb3 ii.d6 (D). We've transposed to the French Defence variation 1 e4 e6 2 d4 d5 3 tt'Bd2 c5 4 exd5 exd5 5 ilb5+ tt'Bc6 6 tt'igf3 ii.d6 7 dxc5 ii.xc5 8 tt'Bb3 ii.d6 9 O-O tt'Be7, except that White might not want to play 1 0 c3 in that case; that is, in the Si cilian 2 ...e6 3 c3 version he has committed to making that move before he might want to. This is a rather sophisticated thing to worry about for all but very experienced players; neverthe less, it makes the position easier for Black to play than it usually would be, and might give less-advanced players a feel for the consider ations that go into top-level opening play. At any rate, all the themes of isolated queen's pawns apply to the diagrammed position; for
218 MASTERING THE CHESS OPENINGS
instance, White blockades the d-pawn and seeks appropriate simplification while Black uses his active pieces and freedom of movement to com promise White' s position. Typical moves for White are �e l , ii.g5-h4-g3, tt'ibd4, iVc2 and ii.d3. Typical moves for Black are . . . ilg4, ... tt'Bf5, ...�e8, and ... 'iVb6 or ... iVf6. Whether you want to play this position for either colour is a matter of taste. a222) You sometimes see the line 6 ii.e3, when apart from 6 ... cxd4 7 ii.xd4, Black has the interesting move 6 ...c4. This is particularly appropriate so as not to allow dxc5 and justify the passive position of White's bishop on e3. White can't yet bring his bishop into active play on d3, and Black can develop effortlessly by ... ii.d6 and ... tt'ige7 unless White does some thing right away. So there usually follows 7 b3 ! cxb3 8 axb3 ii.d6 9 ii.d3 tt'ige7 (D). Since the procedure c4 and tt'Bc3 won't really break down Black's centre ( ... ii.e6 or even ... tt'Bb4 should do well to protect the d5-pawn), Black can be happy with both his pawn-structure and development. After I 0 iVc2 ( 10 O-O ii.f5), Adams-Nunn, Hastings I 996n continued I 0 ...h6 1 1 O-O O-O with equality. Nunn suggests the more interesting sequence 1 O ...ii.g4 1 1 tt'ibd2 �c8 1 2 iVbl ii.h5 intending ... ii.g6 to exchange White's good bishop on d3. b) Some players believe that 3 d3 with a King's Indian Attack set-up (g3, .ltg2 and O-O) is more appropriate against 2 tt'Bf3 e6 than against either 2 tt'Bf3 tt'Bc6 or 2 tt'Bf3 d6. There are at least two ideas behind this assertion: I ) Black's queen's bishop can't get out to an aggressive square. 2) Black will need to use an extra tempo if he wants to play ... e5. The implication is that Black would find ...e5 a desirable move to make, which can be the case in lines with ...g6, ...ii.g7, ... tt'ige7 and ...O-O. This . . .d6/ ... e5 formation (called the Botvinnik structure) discourages some practitioners of the King's Indian Attack. In more specific terms, most players would rather face the 'French Defence' set-up of ...e6, . . . d5, ... tt'Bc6, . . . tt'Bf6 and . . . ii.e7 than others which do not involve the move ...e6. However, the issues that I raise regarding reversed open ings apply here. Those who are familiar with the King's Indian Defence (which is the King's Indian Attack with colours reversed) know that some of the moves that Black might play in a King's Indian Defence don't work out as well in the King's Indian Attack, because Black hasn't committed to the position which makes those moves effective. Here's an example: 3 ... tt'Bc6 4 g3 g6 5 ilg2 (in a paradoxical turnabout that characterizes the flexibility of chess positions, White can seek a radical change in the course of the game by 5 d4!?, moving his pawn a second time but hoping to exploit of the weaknesses created by ...e6 and ...g6; it turns out that there are several good answers, including 5 ...d5 !? and 5 ... cxd4 6 tt'Bxd4 ii.g7 7 tt'Bb5 d5 ! ?, a pro ductive pawn sacrifice) 5 ... ii.g7 6 O-O tt'ige7 7 tt'ibd2 (the typical King's Indian Attack move) 7 . . .O-O 8 �el d6 (or 8 ...e5 !? 9 tt'Bc4 d6) 9 c3 e5 !
(D).
In some ways White's rook is misplaced on el because it doesn't support the pawn-break f4 and is generally not useful against the Botvin nik structure, which consists of ... c5, ...d6 and
SICILIAN DEFENCE 219
... eS. Of course if the rook returns to fl , White is actually a tempo down on a King's Indian Defence position! Therefore White may well tum to the idea of queenside attack by a3 and b4 with an interesting struggle ahead. Let's return to 2 lbf3 e6 3 d4: 3 ...cxd4 4 lbxd4 (D) After 4 lbxd4, Black has a number of op tions, from which I shall choose two basic strat egies: the Sicilian Four Knights Variation, and the Paulsenffaimanov complex.

lbc6 (D) The Four Knights is a perfect example of a Sicilian line that emphasizes development over structure. That is true of only a couple of Sicilian variations, mostly old-fashioned and out of fa vour, so it is instructive to see how the players' considerations differ from those in the conven tional lines. The Four Knights itself is still play able but I should warn you that it probably falls short of equality after 6 lbxc6 bxc6 7 eS lbd5 8 lbe4, a highly tactical line that has been thor oughly tested in recent years. It makes sense that a variation that targets the weak d6-square would be a good weapon against this opening. However, we'll follow another variation that produces games with fundamental conflicts be tween positional and tactical ideas. Buchenthal - Rosen German Cht 197819 6 lbdb5 ii.b4 (D) At this point 6 ...d6 7 ii.f4 eS 8 ii.gs trans poses into the Sveshnikov Variation, which is more commonly arrived at via 1 e4 cS 2 lbf3 lbc6 3 d4 cxd4 4 tt:Jxd4 lbf6 S lbc3 eS 6 ltJdbS d6 7 ii.gs. With the first move-order, both sides have made an extra move due to . . . e6-eS and ilf4-gS. The Sveshnikov contains all kinds of positional and tactical themes, but I felt it less instructive over a broad range of strengths than other variations of the Sicilian, so have not dis cussed it in depth in this book. 7 tt:Jd6+ 7 ilf4 leads to crazy tactics and lengthy the ory after 7 ...lbxe4 8 'Yi'f3 ! d5 9 lbc7+ 'lt>f8 1 0 O-O-O ii.xc3 1 1 bxc3 gS, which ultimately yields equal play according to the books and comput ers.

ltJaS 18 c5 'Yi'd5 19 f5 lbc4 20 fxe6 fxe6 21 �dl (D) In this position Raetsky points out that 2 1 . ..'Yi'd4+! 22 'lt>hl lbe4 (perhaps 22 ... 'Yi'h4! is even better) is fine. At any rate, this example of Black's unusually rapid development in the Si cilian shows that he can achieve equal chances in this traditional variation. Apart from the Sicilian Four Knights, Black has various means of setting up a structure that includes ... a6 within the next few moves, but delays ...d6. The immediate 4 ...a6 (without a very early ... lbc6 or ...d6) is the Paulsen Sys tem, also called the Kan Variation, whereas 4 ...lbc6 followed by ...a6 on one of the next two moves is usually referred to as the Taimanov Variation. Some of Black's ideas in these lines are typical of the other Sicilian systems but many are unique to the ... e6/ ...a6 structure. Paulsen System 4 ...a6 (D) It's curious that this was one of the first Sicil ian Defence lines that was taken seriously by Louis Paulsen, and therefore by many of his successors. Alekhine, for instance, had trouble deciding upon how to meet the Sicilian, feeling that the early ...a6 idea took precedence. The reason that this strikes us oddly is that the Paulsen is so modem in spirit: Black fails to de velop a piece and creates dark-square weak nesses on b6 and d6. His play is extremely flexible, and that is one of its points. Having prevented lbb5, lbf5 and lbc3-d5, he can wait to see how White develops and then react ac cordingly. Among other plans are expansion on the queenside by ...b5 and ... ii.b7, queen devel opment to b6 or c7 (again awaiting events). ac tive piece-play by ... ii.b4 and/or ... ll'lge7-g6. and return to a conventional formation with ...d6 and ... lbf6. His king's bishop in particular can go to e7, d6, c5 or b4; it even finds its way to g7 in some lines, with the move ...g6 creating the travesty of four dark-square holes on Black's third rank. What about White? Let's think about those Sicilian knights in their customary positions on c3 and d4. This is as good a place as any to talk about their positive role in positional as well as attacking terms. Granted, these white knights are ideally restricted by Black's pawns on ab and e6 (the one on e6 being rock solid versus direct fire by f4-f5). And if there were a knight on b3 it would merely aim at the well-protected squares c5 and a5. But the knight is generally preferable on d4 in working together with the one on c3 because their effect is prophylactic. i.e. they prevent Black from making desired freeing moves. Thus if Black plays ...e5. the knights are well-placed to land on d5 and f5. And if Black plays ...d5, then the c3-knight plays a role by attacking the pawn. Moreover. if White responds to ...d5 by exd5, then after ...exd5 the knight on d4 becomes an ideal blockader. In the same situation, if White is able to respond to ...d5 with e5, the d4-knight will be powerfully placed and can support f4-f5 as well. Thus White's knights are restricted. but so are Black's centre pawns, so we might call this a situation of mutual prophylaxis. Notice
222 MASTERING THE CHESS OPENINGS
that this state of affairs also applies to the Tai manov Variation and to a lesser extent, every Sicilian line with pawns on a6 and e6. The modest difference in the case with ...d6 and ...e6 in is that the e6-pawn is easier to attack. After 4 ... a6, White's first decision is whether to: a) put a pawn on c4 and emulate the Mar oczy Bind; b) play for normal development by 5 lbc3; or c) wait to decide by playing 5 .Bd3.

What are the ideas here? With the move 5 c4, White is doing his best to prevent Black from even thinking about ... d5 and ... b5, his tradi tional freeing moves. And Black's development is rather strange. At this point he appears to have lost a tempo on the analogous Taimanov line, which (as shown in the next section) goes I e4 c5 2 lDf3 e6 3 d4 cxd4 4 lDxd4 lbc6 5 c4 lDf6 6 lbc3 .Bb4. After all, in the Paulsen line, Black's a6-pawn is pretty irrelevant compared to having a knight on c6 (as he would have in the Taimanov Variation - see also below). That may on balance be true but there is also the typical paradox of modern Sicilian lines that being a move behind will sometimes result in the better position! In the Taimanov version above, White's best move is probably 7 lDxc6, whereas in the Paulsen White doesn't have that option because there's no knight on c6 to cap ture. This is a specialized instance of what can be a beneficial thinking tool. It's often useful to imagine yourself having an extra move when you're playing an opening variation. What would you do? Can you use the move produc tively? This is a very good exercise that will sometimes give you greater understanding of an opening than detailed and time-consuming study might. 7 .Bd3 Black does well after 7 e5 ! ? lbe4 8 �g4 lbxc3 9 a3 .Bf8 ! 1 0 bxc3 �a5 1 1 �g3 d6 !, a book line that has remained unchallenged for years. 7 ... lbc6 8 lbxc6 dxc6! (D) Another 'tempo-loss' paradox: if you com pare the equivalent Taimanov line again, White has gained the move .Bd3 in return for the inef fectual move ...a6. Surely that must improve White's prospects? But without .Bd3 having been played, the sequence 7 lbxc6 dxc6 ! ? in the Taimanov allows 8 �xd8+, as we shall discuss in that section. This is probably playable for Black, but leaves him with a different set of problems. As it stands in the Paulsen after 8 ...dxc6, 9 �xd8+ isn't possible. So White has gained in development but lost in opportunity. 9 e5

outpost on d4. In that situation as well, it's good for Black to have queens on the board. 9 ...�a5 Now the play gets forced: 10 exf6 .Bxc3+ 11 bxc3 �xc3+ 12 .Bd2 �xd3 13 fxg7 .l:.g8 14 .Bh6 �c3+ 15 @fl �f6 16 �cl e5 17 c5

Black could then transpose into a Taimanov or other Sicilian by 6 ... lbc6 or 6 ...d6, but he has a unique and effective move in 6 ... .Bb4 ! : 7 lDe2 lbf6 8 .Bg2 .Be7 (it's as if Black played ... .Be7 and White had his knight transferred to e2 with out using any time) 9 O-O O-O 10 h3 d6 (D). This position should be equal, since Black has his normal queenside expansion themes and White can't do much on the long diagonal. Generally White will tum his attention king side: 1 1 .Be3 lbc6 1 2 g4 (the beginning of an ambitious advance) 1 2. ..b5 1 3 f4 lbd7 14 lbg3 .l:.e8 15 'Vill d2 .Bb7 1 6 lDce2 (this is a sign that White doesn't know how to continue with his kingside attack and indeed there doesn't seem to be a good plan in that area of the board) 1 6. .. .l:.ad8 l 7 lDd4 lDxd4 18 .Bxd4 e5 !

If White had any chance of equalling the effect of Black's domination of e5 and his threats to the e-pawn, he would have to have some pieces ready to come to d5, which is not realistic at the moment. a2) 19 .Bc3 d5 !

But the Paulsen faithful like to play 6 ... b5 7 O-O .Bb7 in every position. Here it looks wrong after 8 l:.el ! .

Now White has vari ous ways to pursue the attack, and chooses a good one: 1 1 .Bf3 ! d6 (this begs for a check on c6, but it's not easy to get one's pieces out in the face of ideas such as �e2 and lDf5, with .Be3, c3 and l:.c 1 if needed) 12 .Bf4 lbd7 13 lbc6+ .Bxc6 14 dxc6 lbc5 1 5 �d5 ! lDf6 16 �xc5 ! dxc5 17 l:.ad 1 + @c8 1 8 .Bg4+ @b8 19 l:.d8+ @a7 20 l:.xa8+ @xa8 21 .Bxc7 lbxg4 22 l:.e8+ @a7 and my database game gives 23 l:.b8 1 -0 Yang Xian-Ramos, Moscow OL 1994.

The Non-Committal Line 5 .Bd3 (D) By comparison with the analogous Taimanov Variation (4 ... tt:Jc6) White is glad to be able to post his bishop on d3 without first having to de fend, retreat, or exchange his d4-knight. Impor tantly, he retains the option of playing c4. 5 ...iLif6 Black's position is ultra-flexible, with seem ingly infinite room for creativity. At this point he has moves such as 5 ... iLie7, 5 ...�c7, 5 ... .Bc5 (6 iLlb3 .Ba7 or 6 ... .Be7), 5 ... �b6 (with the idea of misplacing the knight and then playing ...�c7; we discuss that ploy elsewhere in this chapter), or 5 ...g6 (D), which deserves a diagram. All of Black's pieces are on the back rank and his position is the definition of holes! Too bad there isn't a pawn left over to put on c6. Yet plenty of grandmasters have played 5 ...g6 and at least one of them, a leading Paulsen theoretician, thinks that Black can equalize from this position with two different set-ups. To me, the most
226 MASTERING THE CHESS OPENINGS
plausible idea is ... .ii. .g7, ... tDe7 and ...d5; but if he can't get ...d5 in, Black can settle for ...d6, ... tDbc6, etc., when he has done reasonably well. That's not all. Are you ready for the outra geous 5 ... d5? In the few tests of this move thus far, no one seems to have come close to refuting it. Most games have gone 6 exd5 'iVxd5 7 O-O tDf6 (7 ....ii. .d7 ! ? in some sense gains a tempo, because now 8 tDc3?? allows 8 ... 'iVxd4 and there's no check; of course you may not want your bishop on d7) 8 tDc3 and now 8 ... 'iVd8, but Black could also play 8 ... 'iVd6 (D): Then Black has another of those 4:3 kingside pawn-majorities that we talk about in so many openings, including the French Defence Tar rasch line that this resembles so strongly. Com pare that variation: 1 e4 e6 2 d4 d5 3 tDd2 c5 4 exd5 'iVxd5 5 tDgf3 cxd4 6 .ii. .c4 'iVd6 7 O-O tDf6 8 tDb3 tDc6 9 tDbxd4 tDxd4 10 tDxd4. It would be a confirmation of the Paulsen's remarkable flexibility if Black could actually get away with (and equalize following) 5 ...d5. My feeling is that one of these many 5th move alternatives might be more rewarding than 5 ... tDf6, which allows White to set up a common and generally effective formation.

By deploying the knight to c6, Black breaks with the noncommittal Paulsen approach. He decides early upon the position of the queen's knight rather than keeping open the option of ... lDd7. He also allows White to play lDb5. In return, he has developed a piece, and his c6- knight limits White's options (for instance, the anti-Paulsen move 5 .Bd3 simply loses a piece here). We'll briefly examine White's three ma jor lines: 5 c4, 5 lDb5 and 5 lDc3.

5 c4 (D)
This advance is somewhat rare but leads to material that is potentially useful. White tries to set up a sort of Maroczy Bind. This is slow in the face of the rapid development that 2 ...e6 and 4 ... lbc6 makes possible, yet both sides must play accurately. 5 ..• lDf6 5 ... 'iVh4 ! ? 6 lbb5 ! ? (6 lbc3 .Bb4) 6 ... 'iVxe4+ 7 .Be2 'iVe5 could get wild and woolly; if Black can get away with an extravagant move like 5 ... 'iVh4, it shows that the loss of time involved with 5 c4 is meaningful. 6 lDc3 .Bb4 7 lbxc6 White exchanges this so as to play .Bd3 and protect the e-pawn (we discussed this in the Paulsen section). It's important to see that Black is not committed to setting up a prepared forma tion with, say, ... 'iVc7 and ... a6. The Taimanov move ... lbc6 goes well with quick development. For instance, White can't simply make Maroczy Bind moves such as 7 f3?! O-O 8 .Be3, because 8 ...d5 ! ( D) is precisely the type of pawn-break that Black wants to make, and White needs to prevent, in any Sicilian Defence. Sometimes students are so intent upon set ting up some restricted Sicilian position with ...d6 and ...e6 that they forget about the basics. You don't see this kind of freeing move very often in the Sicilian because, behind the scenes, White makes his moves so that there is a spe cific drawback to ... d5, such as a multiple cap ture or e5. He is normally successful in doing this, and that' s why you seldom see an effective early ...d5 in any well-played Sicilian, including the Najdorf, Rauzer, Scheveningen, Dragon or for that matter Taimanov. This is obvious to a player accustomed to the Sicilian, but perhaps not to a newcomer who sees many games with ...d6 and ...e6 and assumes that Black just pre fers to play with less active pieces. In the dia grammed position White can't even maintain equality, as a short analysis will show you. Returning to 7 lbxc6 (D), Black has two re captures. 7 ..• bxc6 Muzychuk - Gershon Dresden 2003

This is the usual move, strengthening Black's centre. He can also play 7 ... dxc6! ? 8 �xd8+ @xd8, which is awkward but probably OK so long as Black is able to achieve ... e5, the ideal move that he needs, in order both to get his light-squared bishop out and to secure an out post on d4. For example, 9 f3 ! ? (9 e5 ! is proba bly better, interfering with Black's plans; then 9 ... lbe4 I O a3 ! ? .Bxc3+ 1 1 bxc3 b6 should be looked at - White has no worries, but on the other hand it's hard to see how he will make progress) 9 ...e5 I O .Be3 @c7 (D). 1 1 l:.c I lDd7 ! 12 @f2 ! ? .Bc5 (removing a de fender of d4 while getting rid of White's good bishop) 1 3 lba4!

230 MASTERING THE CHESS OPENINGS
Hedgehog 5 tt'lbS d6 6 c4 With this move White sets up another sort of Maroczy Bind and Black generally plays in what is called 'Hedgehog' fashion: pieces and pawns curled up on the first three ranks waiting for the chance to burst out into activity. This particular form of the Hedgehog has done rea sonably well over the years, although at the very top levels Black still seems to run into problems from time to time. Before entering into that discussion, a varia tion with a colourful history begins 6 .Bf4 e5 7 .Be3. Now Black can play 7 ... a6, but the main line goes 7 ... 'Llf6 8 .Bg5 ! ? (the bishop moves for the third time in a row ! This move protects e4, of course, and also strengthens White's con trol over d5) 8 ... .Be6 (D). Without going into too much detail, Black's development has again been quite rapid, and White can't keep a grip on the position. There are two options here: a) The old main line 9 tt'llc3 a6 10 .Bxf6 gxf6 1 1 'Lla3 (threatening 'Llc4-e3, or 'Lld5, or in some cases �h5) was solved in style by l l . ..d5 ! 1 2 exd5 .Bxa3 1 3 bxa3 �a5 14 �d2 O-O-O. It becomes clear that White won't win the piece, and his development is slow while his extra pawn on the a-file is hardly useful: 1 5 .Bc4 l:.hg8 1 6 l:.dl , and various analysts have looked at 16 . . .l:.xg2 !

At this juncture we look at two games. The first will illustrate White's set-up with the ag gressive f4. The second serves to represent the overall main line with f3. Before that I should mention Kasparov's fa mous gambit in the 1985 world championship match against Karpov, which went 8 ...d5 ! ? 9 exd5 exd5 10 cxd5 lbb4 (D). Contrary to the general opinion, this is still unresolved. In the critical encounter Karpov played 1 1 .Be2 .Bc5? ! 1 2 O-O? .Bf5 and got into great dif ficulties, losing a brilliant game. Later Karpov played 12 .Be3 ! with advantage, the point being 1 2. .. .Bxe3 1 3 �a4+ and 1 4 �xb4. The best move after 1 1 .Be2 is l l ... lDfxd5, which has been heavily analysed down to a promising piece sacrifice for White, as has 1 1 .Bc4 .Bg4 ( l l ...b5 1 2 O-O! bxc4 1 3 l:.el + .Be7 1 4 d6) 12 �d4 b5 1 3 lbcxb5 ! with a big mess. The point of mentioning all this is twofold: a) If you play moves such as 8 ...d5 you sim ply have to memorize a lot of material. b) If the move 8 ...d5 works it invalidates 5 lbb5, because if White can't prevent ...d5 in the Sicilian by direct means it is extremely unlikely that there will be any way to gain a positional advantage thereafter. White Plays f4 Nunn - P. Cramling Zurich 1984 I'll use this game without much analysis to demonstrate an ambitious plan with f4 that af fords White attacking chances but at the cost of loosening his position. Although strong mas ters have had success neutralizing this strategy. it is still a valid approach and in any case quite instructive. 8 .•. .Be7 9 .Be2 O-O 10 O-O b6 1 1 .Be3 lDe5 l 1 . .. .Bb7 is a more accurate choice if Black wants to prevent f4 from being effective, be cause his knight has not used up time on ... lt:Je5- d7. Then the immediate 1 2 f4 gives Black some easy ways to counteract White's structure, in cluding 12. .. l:.c8 1 3 l:.cl l:.e8. Development of the rook to e8 supports ... d5, because the ex change of White's e-pawn will bring the rook into a position facing the vulnerable e3-bishop. Nevertheless, White can play 1 2 l:.c l , hoping for 1 2. .. lbe5 1 3 f4.
12 f4 (D)
The majority of masters have used a forma tion with f3 in this variation, as in the next main game below. Those positions are very well-known and fairly easy to play because of the limited set of piece placements that they logically allow for. Although his chances of gaining an advantage are slim if Black plays accurately, White has more opportunities for original play after f4. 12 ... lDed7 13 .Bf3 .Bb7 14 �e2 Black implemented a positionally effective plan with . . .h6 in Briiggemann-Lutz, Erfurt 2004: 1 4 'it>hl h6 (D). Black's point is to answer 15 g4? ! with 15 ... lbh7 ! and ... g5 next. Then Black has essen tially made White's f3-bishop a bad one, since e5 can't be played and he has neutralized any pawn advances at the same time.

doing reasonably well if you compare this wilb a 'normal' Hedgehog arising from the English Opening. The knight on a3 can' t possibly be su perior to that on d4 and it has used four moves to get to the edge of the board! On the olbc:r hand Black can't even think about ...b5. So what' s going on here? From Black' s point of view it would be nice to do something positive before White catches up by rerouting his knight and pushing his queenside pawns. But in this sort of Hedgehog formation Black famously waits until the opportunity comes for ...b5 or ... d5. What to do? There are two main stnre- gies. One is to play moves like ... :es . ... 9b8 and ... i..f8, and then get serious about ... d5. 1be other is to embark upon the now-famous plan of ... i..d8-c7 (with minor threats on the king side) followed by ...@h8, ... l:!.g8 and ... g5-g4. generally with more serious threats. This is an important strategy for both sides to know, if only because White has been blown away by the attack in so many games. There's another rather silly-looking attack by ...h5-h4 (and. if allowed, ...h3 to enhance the power of the b7- bishop). This has been tried several times in recent master practice without White having found a convincing counterplan. Of these three ideas, the easiest for White to stop should be the first (a ...d5 break) but he has to be careful. as shown by 1 5. .. l:!.ad8 (instead of 1 5. .. l:tacS. which is probably objectively better) 1 6 �fl 'ikb8 1 7 ll'lc2?! l:!.fe8 1 8 \t>h l ? d5 ! 1 9 cxd5 exd5 20 exd5 i..d6 2 1 g3 b5 22 a3 �a8 23 �g2 ll'le5 !?

How about White? Taking the ... .itd8-c7, ... l:tg8, ...g5 idea first, White will first play 'lt>hl and .ltgl to guard h2, and then .itfl for potential second-rank defence by the queen. With that formation you can see that in our main game those first moves of the plan, ... .itd8-c7, can be difficult to implement. Furthermore, White's knight on a3 may not be badly placed to meet Black's strategy. With the queen on b8, for in stance, the moves l:tbl and b4 will discourage ... d5, when Black has to watch out for the move c5, followed in some cases by lllc4. Alterna tively, White can run his queenside pawns at Black by 'llc2 and b4, a4 and a5. Right in the middle of that process Black has to be able to strike in the centre based upon the looseness of White's queenside; whether he is able to do so resolves the question of who stands better. 16 .itfl (D) As explained, this clears the second rank, and the bishop might have been a target along the e-file anyway.

Black's strategy provides yet another demonstration of the flexibility associ ated with ...e6 and ... a6. 6 .lte2 There is also independent theory on 6th move deviations after 5 ...a6 showing ideas that do not also apply to the Paulsen: a) After 6 ltJxc6 bxc6, White can play 7 e5 ! ?

In the latter case White has an aggressive posture but his knight might be better-placed on d2, from where it has the squares c4 and f3 within reach. In both cases the move ...a6 tends to be wasted; on the other hand these may not be the best plans for White versus a Paulsenffaimanov structure. b) Here's a really exotic opening idea for those who've never seen it: 6 g3 ctJge7 7 ctJb3 d6 8 .ltg2 .itd7 9 O-O ctJc8 ! ?

h3, he has weakened his kingside and failed to contest the f4-square. But upon g3, Black's ad vance ...h5-h4 can be extremely annoying. Fur thermore, the bishop can switch to the g l -a7 diagonal when called upon to do so. If White plays f4, a bishop on c5 may be very strong. b) Black's bishop controls important dark squares from d6; in some lines it goes to e5 in advance of moving the d-pawn, or it may go to f4 and trade bishops. The ending in that case is easier for Black than it looks provided he keeps his king in the centre. c) Black may also be able to delay f4, which is key to White's strategy. One theme in this re gard is ... ltJe5-g6, perhaps in conjunction with ...f6. Along those lines, it's worth noting that if White had avoided the exchange of knights on d4, then the same idea could be expressed by ... ltJge7-g6. By the time f4 is played (probably supported by the preparatory move g3), then Black will normally have ...b5 and ... .ltb7 in, so that White has some weakness on the long di agonal which will discourage him from playing e5.

ltJc6 7 .ltc4 (D) We have arrived at the Sozin Attack. It is sim ilar to the Najdorf 6 .ltc4 variation but Black's knight is on c6. That implies the possibility of earlier simplification by ... ctJxd4, which ren ders White's idea f4-f5 less effective. Black is also unlikely to have to worry about the sacri fice .ltxe6 that was a hallmark of the Najdorf line. And even the possibility of f4 followed by e5 can lose force because Black has a natural retreating and counterattacking square for his attacked knight on d7 . White has ample resources, the nature of which are completely dependent upon his choice of piece deployments, especially that of the queen. If she goes to f3, for example, Black will struggle to achieve ...b5 unless he exchanges on d4. But . . . ctJxd4 brings another piece to the cen tre, normally White's bishop, which then aims
SICILIAN DEFENCE 139
at Black' s king. In the absence of that exchange, the move f5 can still be effective. If White cas tles kingside he will almost certainly play f4 and aim for e5. But the most compelling varia tions arise when White castles queenside and plays his remaining attacking weapon, namely g4-g5. It is no coincidence that the g-pawn ad vance established itself in this variation some years back and presaged the flood of g4 attacks in the Sicilian and other openings. Somehow modem theory keeps settling upon that move as the most effective one in long-disputed attack ing variations. 7 ... i.e7 Here we'll show three games illustrating the ...e6/ ...t?Jc6 positions: one in which White cas tles king side, another in which his king stays in the middle of the board, and a modem one in which he plays O-O-O.

Here we have a quintessential old-style Si cilian scenario: White's forces aim at the king side, including his knight, queen, both of his bishops, and his rook on the open file. He would like to play 'ifg4 and tiJf6 (even as a sac rifice), and l:tad l , whereas the sacrifice llxf7 might easily enter into the picture. For his part, Black will be sure to target White's unsupported weakness on e5. Black's kingside is generally solid and his e6-pawn ne gates the pressure from White's b3-bishop. He would also like to simplify, beginning by ex changing off the bothersome knight on e4. be fore White can cause him tactical difficulties. In the meantime Black has his usual control of the c-file, supporting desirable moves such as ... t?Jc5 at the right moment.

Boto - Buntic Bosnia 2001 This move, together with queenside castling, characterizes the Velimirovic Attack. Within hundreds of brilliancies that have bee n played by both sides of this opening, we find certain themes that are fundamental to attacking in the Sicilian Defence. Many of them were first played in games with this variation, or at least brought to prominence by their use in them. I'll try to show a few of these essential building blocks of Sicilian attacks. Looking over the older games by Veli� vie himself, you see the tactical philosophy ex pressed by Kasparov, who stresses 'cutting the board in two' , resulting in attractive-looking pieces uselessly stranded from defence of the king. 8 ... a6 8 ...O-O 9 O-O-O 'ifa5 was played in the famous encounter Fischer-Geller, Skopje/Krusevo/Ohrid

In this position Velimirovic's first idea was the uninhibited g4-g5 followed by whatever was necessary to get at Black's king. Then at tention focused mainly upon g4 and �hg l , with precisely the same strategy but differently exe cuted. Sometimes White has also succeeded after f4 and either f5 or e5, but that hasn't estab lished itself as well as the other two.
9 ...O-O
Here is one of Velimirovic's games in the first days of the Attack. The thing that shocked people about this and games in the next notes was not that sacrifices like ctJf5 and ctJd5 were being made but how slow they seemed to be and how little material was needed to make the at tacks work: 9 ... 1ii c7 10 .Bb3 ctJa5 1 1 g4 b5 12 g5 ctJxb3+ 13 axb3 ctJd7 14 ctJf5 ! !

This is all in the boo ks (or at least most of it is), and will certainly repay study. We now return to 5 c4 ( D ): After 5 c4, White has a large space advan tage that will usually dominate the centre for as long as White maintains the c4/e4 structure. On the negative side, he has a weakness on d4 (much as in a queen's pawn opening where White plays d4, c4 and e4). White's plan is to use his superiority in space to expand and throt tle Black's position. All three areas of the board are available, but he will normally use the centre and queenside. Many endgames favour White.
246 MASTERING THE CHESS OPENINGS
and in particular Black has to be sure that with his queen on a5 and White's on d2, the move tZ'Bd5 won't be effective. Black would like to achieve the break ...b5 in order to chip away at White's centre; obviously this usually involves ...a6. Sometimes he can play .. .f5 for the same purpose, but that is un common until later in the game. Finally, he would like to work on the dark squares, espe cially in view of the unprotected state of d4.

Clearly, one of the key questions surrounding the Accelerated Fianchetto is whether Black can actually gain anything significant from the 'Accelerated' aspect of it, by comparison with the standard Dragon. If not, then why allow White the extra option of the Maroczy Bind. which at the very least reduces Black's chances of playing for a win? After 1 e4 c5 2 ctJf3 ctJc6 3 d4 cxd4 4 ctJxd4 g6 5 lbc3 i.g7 6 i.e3, etc., you will see that even in this best of worlds, Black may not achieve all that he wants. That is, Black uses a bag of tricks in order to lure White away from the Yugoslav Attack, but a moderately knowledgeable opponent will know how to avoid the pitfalls and return play to the main line Yugoslav channels. Black indeed gains in
248 MASTERING THE CHESS OPENINGS
some respects by limiting White's options: spe cifically, White has to commit his bishop to c4 and has lost the opportunity to play the popular antidote to the Dragon involving 9 O-O-O. But Black needs to be clear that he can only avoid the 9 .Bc4 version of the Yugoslav Attack by playing sidelines such as 8 ... a5, which are un likely to equalize fully. None of this should discourage a player who is below master level, of course. There will al ways be plenty of winning chances against av erage competition, even with the Maroczy Bind. I do think, however, that you probably won't want to play this system for life. Alapin Variation l e4 c5 2 c3 (D) Known as the 'Alapin Variation' , 2 c3 partic ularly appeals to those turned off by the mas sive theory associated with the Open Sicilian. On the positive side, White tries to build up a centre with minimal risk. Generally, however, 2 c3 lacks punch and might not appeal to the at tacking player. My stated philosophy in this book is to exam ine the most 'important' openings, especially older and established ones that have played a leading role for many years. For the purposes of presenting a Sicilian variation that isn't in that mould, I've chosen the Alapin Variation instead of, for instance, the Closed Sicilian, because it has some universal ideas that are applicable to other lines in this book and opening study in general. The main responses are 2 ... d5 and 2 ... tZ'Bf6. We' ll have only a partial look at those but with relevant details. Other fairly respectable con tinuations include 2 ... b6, 2 ...d6 (and perhaps even 2 ... 1ii a5 ! ?), but I'll skip those and talk briefly about some alternatives that are better known: a) 2 ...e6 is discussed under the order 2 tZ'Bf3 e6 3 c3 in the 'Introduction to 2 ...e6' , except for the line 3 d4 d5 4 exd5 ( 4 e5 is the Advance French, an important transposition to bear in mind) 4 ... exd5 (4 ... 1ii xd5 will usually trans- pose) 5 .Be3 when 5 ... cxd4 6 .Bxd4 tZ'Bc6 7 .Bb5 a6 is considered equal. The plan discussed via the 2 tZ'Bf3 move-order of 5 ... c4 still has the ef fect of making .Be3 look like an unnecessarily passive move and with care to bring his pieces out quickly Black should stand satisfactorily. b) 2 ...g6 3 d4 cxd4 4 cxd4 d5 will often transpose to the variation 1 e4 c5 2 tZ'Bf3 g6 3 c3 .Bg7 4 d4 cxd4 5 cxd4 d5. The main lines are 5 exd5 (5 e5 .Bg7 is similar to the transposition mentioned; then 6 tZ'Bf3 .Bg4 7 .Bb5+ tZ'Bd7 has been played, among others) 5 ... tZ'Bf6 6 tbc3 (6 tbf3 tZ'Bxd5 7 tZ'Bc3 .Bg7 comes directly from that line) 6 ... .Bg7 7 .Bc4, when Black chooses his method of regaining the pawn: ...a6, or ... tZ'ibd7 and ...tZ'Bb6. According to current knowledge, he is able to get a quite playable game and come close to achieving full equality. Counterattack with . . . dS 2• • •d5 3 exd5 1ii xd5 4 d4 tZ'Bf6 4 ...tZ'Bc6 5 tZ'Bf3 .Bg4 is also played, when one ambitious line for White is 6 .Be2 cxd4 7 cxd4 e6 8 tZ'Bc3 'iiV a5 9 h3 .Bh5 1 0 d5 !? but 1 0. .. exd5 1 1 tZ'Bd4 tZ'Bxd4 ( l 1 ....Bxe2) 1 2 .Bxh5 tZ'Bc6 was easy enough (and equal) for Black in Nayer Lautier, Khanty-Mansiisk FIDE WCup 2005. 5 tZ'Bf3 (D) 5 • • •.tg4 5 ... tbc6 is an important alternative for those who are unhappy with some aspect of 5 ....Bg4, perhaps 6 dxc5 in the next note. Play usually continues 6 .Be2 cxd4 (or 6 ...e6 7 O-O cxd4) 7 cxd4 e6 8 tZ'Bc3 1ii d6 9 O-O .Be7. Black wants to play ...O-O, ...b6 and ... .Bb7, with ... .l:.fd8 in some cases. White can build up by .Be3, 1ii d2 and .l:.fd 1, but his position would contain little dynamic potential. Therefore White sometimes
SICILIAN DEFENCE 249
tries to force the pace: 10 ctJb5 'iiV d8 (10. .. 1ii b8 !? 1 1 g3 ctJd5 1 2 .Bc4 a6 1 3 .Bxd5 axb5 14 .Be4 favours White's active pieces) 1 1 ctJe5 ! ? ( 1 1 .Bf4 ctJd5 1 2 .Bg3 O-O { or 12 ...a6} 1 3 .Bc4 a6 14 .Bxd5 exd5 1 5 ctJc7 .l:.b8 with equality) 1 1 ...O-O ( l l ....Bd7 1 2 ctJxd7 'iiV xd7 1 3 .Be3 O-O is also fine: d5 is permanently blockaded) 12 lbxc6 bxc6 13 ctJc3 .l:.b8 (D ). We see this kind of position in several open ings. As long as Black can develop quickly and use the b-file, his isolated c-pawn is not a prob lem. White's d-pawn is just as exposed and is obviously not going anywhere if Black doesn't exchange it. Neither side can claim much, if any, advantage, but either side can play for a win. 6 .Be2 6 dxc5 was brought to the forefront about a decade ago and has enjoyed a steady popular ity. That may say less about the move's merits than it does about White's difficulties in getting an advantage with 2 c3. In any case, the main line goes 6 ... 1ii xc5 ( 6 ... 'iiV xd 1 + 7 @xd 1 e5 8 b4 e4 9 h3 has been tested and argued about for some years now; most players seem to shun it as Black) 7 ctJa3 (7 .Be3 1ii c7 8 h3 .Bh5 9 ctJbd2 ctJbd7) 7 ... ctJbd7 8 h3 .Bh5 9 .Be3 1ii c8! and Black should have a satisfactory position. That assessment is not shared by everyone, however. 6 ...e6 7 .Be3
7 c4 1ii
d7 only serves to expose White's cen tre. 7 ••• cxd4 Now that 8 dxc5 is a threat (in some cases c4 is as well), Black exchanges. But by delaying he has committed White's bishop to the rather passive post on e3. 8 cxd4 ctJc6 9 ctJc3 1ii d6 (D) This retreat is better than another (for exam ple, 9 ... 1ii d8) for two reasons: it stops the active move .Bf4 and allows Black to increase the pressure on White's d-pawn after ... .l:.d8 at some point. The dark-squared bishop belongs on e7 anyway.
10 O-O .Be7
We've reached a standard isolated pawn posi tion in which White will pit his activity against Black's more static advantages, primarily pres sure on the isolated queen's pawn and well placed pieces. White may nudge Black's bishop to h5 by h3 and reserve the move g4 for later. He sometimes builds up by means of 'iiV b3 fol lowed by bringing a rook to d l . We saw many examples of this type of position in the intro ductory chapters. This particular one appears unpromising for White, since his pieces are less active than in those positions and d5 will be ex tremely hard to achieve.

The 2 . . . lbf6 Variation 2• •. lbf6 3 es liJdS (D) This set-up resembles an Alekhine Defence, and Black would very much like to have ...c5 in if he were playing that opening ! But it's not so simple, because White is not intending to kick the d5-knight around with pawns when he can develop his pieces instead. The Alapin with 2 ... ctJf6 can lead to rather theory-heavy play. Here's an outline of some of the wide range of continuations: 4 d4 4 ctJf3 lbc6 5 ii.c4 ctJb6 6 ii.b3 c4 7 ii.c2 g5 ! ? is another eccentric line; current theory has it as equal, whatever that means in such an unbal anced position. 4 ... cxd4 The usual starting-point. Only a 2 c3 special ist would know if White has any way to squeeze something from the position. 5 ctJf3 White can also play the direct 5 cxd4 d6 (5 ...e6 6 ctJc3 lbxc3 7 bxc3 'Ji/Bc7 8 .Bd2 b6 has been a popular system in the past) 6 ctJf3 lbc6, when a traditional line is 7 .Bc4 (or 7 ctJc3 lbxc3 8 bxc3 e6) 7 ... ctJb6 (7 ... e6) 8 .Bb5 dxe5 9 lbxe5 .id?

The game is equal. 5 ... ctJc6 (D) 5 ...d6 6 cxd4 e6 leads to a line discussed in the introduction to the 2 ctJf3 e6 section. 6 .Bc4 6 cxd4 d6 7 ctJc3 can be met by 7 ...e6 8 ctJxd5 exd5 with equality.
6. •. ctJb6
If Black plays 6 ...e6 7 cxd4 d6, we again have the line referred to in the note to 5 ... ctJc6. 7 .Bb3 d5 Capturing the offered pawn by 7 ...dxc3 8 lbxc3 is risky. 8 exd6 'Jilixd6 (D) Black is generally thought to have equality here, although as usual there are lengthy analy ses of variations which, fortunately, your aver age opponent will never have heard of.

Nevertheless, White may be interested in play ing such a position because it's double-edged enough to be interesting. 1 2 Caro-Ka n n Defence l e4 c6 (D) This is the official starting-point for the Caro-Kann. Now 2 d4 is played in a clear ma jority of games, though naturally White can try to react to the idea of 2 ... d5 in other ways. As always, these early deviations can be very edu cational, and one of them sets up a respectable structure that is played on a regular basis: Caro-Kann Two Knights 2 ctJf3
2 c4 is another important alternative to the
main lines: 2 ...d5 (2 ... e5 3 ctJf3 d6 4 d4 is some sort of Old Indian Defence that most Caro Kann players won't be comfortable with) 3 exd5 cxd5 usually transposes to the Panov At tack by means of 4 d4 - see later in this chapter. White can also try 4 cxd5, when 4 ... 1ii xd5 loses a tempo after 5 ctJc3. However serious that may or may not be, White will follow up with d4 and some advantage; e.g., 5 ... 1ii a5 6 d4 ctJf6 7 ctJf3
(D).
This compares well for White with a Scandi navian Defence ( 1 e4 d5 2 exd5 1ii xd5 3 ctJc3 1ii a5 4 d4 ctJf6 5 ctJf3), because Black cannot re strain White's centre by the useful ...c6. In re turn, White has no pawn on c2. But in the Scan dinavian, the c2-pawn can be a disadvantage for White for a couple of reasons. For one thing it's a target of a bishop on f5 and sometimes a knight on b4; but more significantly it's not up on c4 to make the centre more mobile, nor on c3 where it would protect White's d4-pawn. Furthermore, you should note that without a c pawn, White has the handy move 1iib 3 if Black's c8-bishop strays from the queenside. Thus, instead of 4 ...1ii xd5, Black almost al ways plays 4 ... ctJf6 5 ctJc3 (5 i.b5+ will even tually lead to White losing back his d-pawn after either 5 ... i.d7 or 5 ... ctJbd7; in the latter case, ... a6 and either . . . b5 or ... ctJb6 can fol- low) 5 ... lbxd5 6 d4 and we're back to the iso- lated queen's pawn position that characterizes the Panov Attack. The text-move (2 ctJf3) is easily White's most promising independent try and deserves a look for those who want a somewhat less-travelled path. 2 ... d5 3 ctJc3 (D) This sequence tries to use piece-play and quick development to cause Black discomfort. For instance, line 'a' in the next note is a good example of this. 3 ... i.g4 This is most players' choice. Otherwise: a) If Black plays 3 ...dxe4 4 lbxe4 i.f5?!, White shows the benefit of his quick develop ment by harassing the bishop with 5 ctJg3 i.g6

6 h4 threatening h5. Compare this with the
standard line 2 d4 d5 3 lt:Jc3 dxe4 4 lt:Jxe4 j.J5 5 lt:Jg3 .llg6. In our current position with 2 lt:Jf3 d5 3 lt:Jc3, the f3-knight is ready to spring to e5. White will at the very least win the two bishops and remain with good development (keep in mind that winning the bishop-pair often comes at the cost of development). After 6 h4, play goes 6 ...h6 (6 ... lt:Jf6 7 h5 .lle4 8 lt:Jxe4 lt:Jxe4 9 d4 e6 10 .lld3 gives White two bishops and good development) 7 lt:Je5 �d6 (7 ... .llh7??, to preserve the bishop, loses to 8 �f3 ! lt:Jf6 9 �b3 with a double attack on f7 and b7) 8 lt:Jxg6 �xg6 9 d4 and White will soon play .lld3 forc ing the queen to move again. b) 3 ... lt:Jf6?! 4 e5 lt:Jfd7 5 e6 ! fxe6 6 d4 fa vours White, who would like to play .lld3 with lt:Jg5 or, if Black plays ...lt:Jf6, then lt:Je5 paraly ses him. c) The move ...c6 doesn't go very well with 3 ...d4 4 lt:Je2; for instance, 4 ...c5 5 c3 and Black's centre can't be held after 5 ... lt:Jc6 6 cxd4 cxd4 7 �a4 d3.

This position is sup posed to be playable for Black, although it is dangerous for him in view of h4-h5 or simply d4 and .llf4.

What they may not know is that Tal also de lighted chess fans with his astonishing origi nality and piquant humour. One of the most wonderful moves in his career reflected both of these qualities: 5 gxf3 ! !? (D). To play such an absurd move in a casual game is one thing; in an international tourna ment, another. But in the refined atmosphere of the World Championship one doesn't do such things ! Nevertheless, in Tal-Botvinnik, Mos cow Wch (3) 1 960, White shocked everyone (and, I hope, made them laugh) by recapturing with the g-pawn. I think that only recently have we begun to see a growth in players' receptivity towards apparently unprincipled moves in the opening. Tal would have been pleased by this. At any rate, he promptly got an inferior game but recovered and fought his way to a draw. In spite of the condemnation that 5 gxf3 received, Tal's mistaken follow-up is easily improved upon (by his own suggestions, for starters), and it's a little disappointing that so few players have risked their precious ratings just once to give the move a try. Kudos to Chris Depasquale, who has two games out of the 28 with 5 gxf3 in Megabase 2006. We now return to 5 �xf3 (D). This move, on the other hand, is represented by about 2 1 00 Megabase games, still somewhat less than 2% of all Caro-Kanns. White has gained the two bishops in return for somewhat reduced central control. Black is

happy to have exchanged his light-squared bishop, since he will be setting up his pawns on light squares. Play can develop along several lines. 5 ... e6 Another set-up begins with 5 ... lt:Jf6 6 d3 e6. White's bishops don't have any exceptionally good squares, and while White gets reorga nized Black will get all his pieces out and play ... e5, trading space and active pieces for the two bishops.

Black sets up the kind of restraint structure that is seen in the Slav, Scandinavian and other defences: pawns on light squares to comple ment the dark-squared bishop while restraining White's centre. As in those openings, one idea is to get developed quickly and play either ... c5 or ... e5. See the Chapter 3 on structures for some examples. Let's now tum to the main lines.
1 e4 c6 2 d4 d5 (D)
The Caro-Kann resembles the French De fence in that Black places a pawn on d5 on the second move and forces White to decide what to do with his e4-pawn: advance, exchange, defend
254 MASTERING THE CHESS OPENINGS
or gambit. Some of the resulting positions are quite similar. It has also been said that the Caro Kannresembles the Slav because l ...c6 takes away the 'best' square c6 from the knight, but keeps an open view for his light-squared bishop. Not surprisingly, however, the characters of the positions arising from 1 e4 and 1 d4 turn out to be radically different: there isn't a Slav Advance Variation, and e4 by White is a rarity in the Slav. In any event, 2 ... d5 compels a response. I'll be looking at 3 exd5 (both the Exchange Varia tion and Panov Attack) and 3 e5, the Advance Variation. I think that those variations are the most useful and consistent in terms of this book's organization. I won't be dealing with the 3 tl:Bc3 main lines, although naturally they're full of wonderful ideas. I'm also leaving out the 'Fantasy Variation' 3 f3, although it has its points of interest. A curious positional compar ison arises after 3 f3 e6! ? 4 tl:Bc3 i.b4 (these are not the only moves, of course), when 5 e5(?) c5 is actually a good version of the French De fence because White's 'extra' tempo due to ...c6-c5 has been used for the awful move f3, which not only loosens White's kingside but takes away f3 for the knight and cuts off White's queen from the kingside. Exchange Variation 3 exd5 cxd5 (D) An enormously instructive variation, the study of which will benefit all chess-players. We'll look at White's slow build-up with c3, and then tum to the more aggressive Panov At tack with c4. The c3 Systems 4 i.d3 tl:Bc6 5 c3 This more conservative development isn't supposed to promise White much, but it has some sting and the pawn-structure is particu larly thought-provoking. 5 .•• tl:Bf6 (D) Now we'll run into some familiar ideas. 6 i.f4 This is the customary approach, and most likely to achieve something tangible. However, let's say that White plays 6 tl:Bf3, Black answers with the natural 6 ... i.g4, and there follows 7 O-O e6 8 tt:'ibd2 i.d6 9 .l::t el O-O. All very logical. Then White might want to re spond to the presence of Black's bishop on g4: 10 tl:ifl °V/ii c7 1 1 i.g5 tt:'Bd7 12 tl:Bg3 (D). What do we have here? A classical Queen's Gambit Declined Exchange Variation (Carls bad) with colours reversed ! In this position,
CARO-KANN DEFENCE
especially since one of the standard QGD plans ... lt:Je4 is not available (that' s lt:Je5 in our Caro Kann case), Black might want to play the minor ity attack 1 2. .. l:tab8 13 h3 .llxf3 14 �xf3. Then it' s as though White has played four of Black's common Queen's Gambit moves ( ... .lle7, the re capture ... .llxf6 and the repositioning ... .Ile 7-d6) in one move ! Of course neither side has played according to a conventional Caro-Kann plan, but it's interesting to see how the same pawn structure in both an e-pawn opening and a d pawn opening leads to the theme of minority at tack vs kingside attack. Naturally we could have obtained an exactly reversed position by 4 lL:\f3 lt:Jc6 5 c3 .llg4 6 .lle2 e6 7 O-O .lld6 8 lt:Jbd2 lt:Jf6 (or 8 ... lt:Jge7 ! ?), etc., but those are not the most pointed moves, especially for White. Let's return to the Caro-Kann line after 6 .llf4. We'll follow the young Kasparov.

change of White's good bishop. This is a com mon theme even with a knight on f3; in that case, after lt:Je5 and ... .llg6, Black isn't afraid of lt:Jxg6 because knights are strong in these posi tions and he gets a useful h-file. Moreover, the light-squared bishop is still Black's bad bishop (see the pawns on d5 and e6). Of course, 7 lt:Je2 is also possible. 7 ••.�d7 8 lt:Jd2 e6 9 lt:Jgf3 .lld6!

The at tack on d5 poses some problems for Black, be cause if he captures on c4, White's bishop gets out to an active square in one jump, whereas in many isolated queen's pawn positions like the one soon to occur, White has to take two moves (usually .lld3 and then .llxc4) to get there, or he has to play a less desirable extra 'waiting' move such as a3, .l::t c l or .llg5. Compare isolated queen's pawn positions in the Queen's Gambit Declined or Nimzo-Indian, for instance, and see the further comments below. 4 ... tt:'Bf6 5 tt:'Bc3 ( D) This is the starting position of the Panov At tack, also known as the 'Panov-Botvinnik At tack' because of the former World Champion's contributions to it. 5 ...e6 5 ... g6 gives a Griinfeld-like position in which Black usually lets White temporarily win the d pawn and then tries to win it back via ... tt:'ibd7- b6 or ...a6/. ..b5. I'll forego that line here. The main alternative is 5 ... tl:Bc6, which intro duces a different set of problems and structures that I shall try to outline in broad-brush fashion.

Although I won't be looking into those, I

should mention that 6 ... e6 7 lt:Jf3 i.e7 leads to one of those positions that we were talking about in which White may not want to lose a tempo after 8 i.d3 dxc4 9 i.xc4, and thus con siders moves such as 8 l:tc 1 and 8 a3. The inde pendent idea of 8 c5 is also possible. These positions will repay study, and in fact you might want to sit down and try to work out the details without recourse to books or other sources. b) 6 lL:\f3 ( D) is the main move. Then: bl) Sometimes 6 ... i.e6 is played to threaten ...dxc4 and protect the centre at the same time. Anand-Miles, Wijk aan Zee 1 989 shows one way to convert the pawn-structure (pretty much by force) and then build up a superior position:
7 c5 g6 8 i.b5 i.g7 9 lt:Je5 i.d7 10 i.xc6! bxc6
1 1 O-O O-O 1 2 J::i. e l i.e8 1 3 h3 (or 1 3 �e2) 1 3. .. @h8 14 i.f4 lt:Jg8 1 5 b4 f6 1 6 lt:Jf3 �d7 1 7 a4. White has a moderate but certain advantage. It's difficult for Black to find anything positive to do, and Anand won rather easily. b2) The most important reply is 6 ... i.g4, because it carries with it the positional threat of 7 ... i.xf3 and gives White few serious options. The most common and well-analysed one is 7 cxd5 lt:Jxd5 8 �b3 i.xf3 9 gxf3 (D). White has implemented the mini-rule that when one side brings their queen's bishop out early, the opponent should strongly consider bringing his queen to the queenside, in this case to b3, because the bishop has abandoned de fence of that wing. Here White has carried out that idea at the cost of doubled f-pawns. Now 9 ... lt:Jxd4?? loses to 10 i.b5+, and 9 ...lt:Jxc3 1 0 bxc3 i s considered good for White because of
B
his bishops, queenside pressure, and the move d5. But 9 ... lt:Jb6 is not fully worked out. It allows White attacking sequences beginning with 10 d5 !

White's horrible doubled f-pawns are compensated for or outweighed by his open files (providing some bothersome threats against the king), his more effective bishop, and Black's own two weak pawns. Probably the result with perfect play is a draw, but Black has to play more accurately than White does, which probably explains a lot of players' inclination towards the more com mon move 5 . .. e6 (D), to which we return now. 6 lt:Jf3 Here we'll look at a few of the thousands of games that have been played from this position. Fortunately there's quite a bit of material on iso lated queen's pawns throughout this book (for a lengthy introduction to the subject, see Chapter 3), so this lesson will not stand on its own. We'll see three different 6th moves for Black. Velimirovic - Benko Vrnjacka Banja 1973 6 ••• J.e7 7 cxd5 exd5 ( D) I think it's important to understand that this recapture, while safe-looking, can give White some real prospects.

Here we see one danger in the pawn-structure after 7 cxd5 exd5, which is that the d-pawns are iso lated. Normally when such a pawn is masked by another (and thus not on an open file), it poses no problems. But the fact that 1 1 �3 targeted the d5-pawn caused Black's knight to go to a miser able position on b6, which became the reason for White's advantage. 9 lt:Je5 J.d7 10 O-O O-O 11 l:lel .l::t c8 12 J.g5 J.e6 13 J.xc6 bxc6 14 lt:Ja4 h6 15 J.xf6 J.xf6 16 lt:Jc5 (D)

White stands well, although 1 6 .l:k 1 was pos sibly more accurate. 6 ... i.e7 7 cxd5 lt:Jxd5 is a main-line IQP po sition and is similar to 6 ... i.b4 below. If this were a book on theory I'd have to be more spe cific, but this really is one of those instances in which it's fair to say that the ideas are much more important than the details. Therefore I'll limit myself to one main game, although an other very attractive contest is embedded in the note to White's 8th move. Matveeva - Anand Frunze 1987 6 ••• i.e7 7 cxd5 lt:Jxd5 This transposes to a Queen's Gambit Ac cepted (since i.c4 is played next), but just as often it arises from a Panov move-order.

B
been more discoveries here than in any other variation of the Caro-Kann, and indeed more than most openings. 3 . . . .ltf5 Strong players over the years have tried to at tack White's pawn-chain at the base by 3 ...c5, the idea being that 4 c3 might allow Black's c8- bishop to develop outside Black's own pawns; e.g., 4 ... tt:'Bc6 5 tt:'Bf3 cxd4 6 cxd4 .ltg4 or some such. But this takes Black two moves with his c-pawn, and 4 dxc5 changes the structure dra matically. After 4 ...e6 (D), you may recognize the similarity to the French Defence Advance Variation, i.e. 1 e4 e6 2 d4 d5 3 e5 c5 4 dxc5, but then it's Black's move! That's because of the tempo loss ...c6-c5. In the French Defence move-order. 4 dxc5 is harm less or worse because it weakens e5 and brings Black's pieces out quickly. The first question, then, is whether having lost a whole tempo, this position can still be played for Black. That is at least possible, since it is generally favourable for Black in the French. The flip side of the question is whether this basic white pawn structure, advocated by Nimzowitsch, really can be played for an advantage. According to conventional theory, White is supposed to over protect the e5-pawn against assault by .. .f6, such that any capture with .. .fxe5 will leave him with a permanent outpost on d5 from which his pieces can't be driven away. That is not so eas ily done. Alternatively, White can use his extra tempo simply to hold on to the c5-pawn and re main a pawn up! It's worth examining these two strategies, which can be introduced in a few ways: a) 5 .ltd3 tt:'Bc6 (5 ... .ltxc5? 6 'ti'g4 forces Black into an awkward defence of his g-pawn; he either has to move his king or make the very weakening move ...g6) 6 tt:'Bf3 (this is the same as 5 tt:'Bf3 .ltxc5 6 .ltd3) 6 ... .ltxc5 7 O-O tt:'ige7 !

Black appears to be doing fine in these positions. b) Also by analogy with the French De fence, the apparently untried 5- 'ti'g4! would be very interesting, tying Black's bishop to f8 and preparing tt:'Bf3, .ltd3, etc. The queen is ready to overprotect e5 from g3, as shown by 5 ... tt:'Bc6 6 tt:'Bf3 f5 (6 ...

Probably Black can play better but he looks short of equality in any event. Although playable, it appears that after 3 ...c5 4 dxc5, White's extra tempo somewhat out weighs Black's pleasant pawn-structure. The move 5 °ii g4! is particularly worrisome. Thus the normal move 3 ... .i.f5 (D), to which we now return, is critical: White has an amazing number of valid op tions in the position after 3 ... .ltf5, expressing diverse and creative approaches. I've chosen to look at two modern variations ( 4 tt:'Bf3 and in particular 4 .i.e3) in most detail because they represent a mix of approaches, from the purely positional to tactical. However, some of the alternatives are them selves main lines and hence deserve close at tention: a) 4 tt:'Bc3 e6 5 g4 .i.g6 6 tt:'ige2 has led to great attacking chess and been a favourite for over a decade now.

The Short Variation 4 tt:'Bf3 (D) This move revolutionized the Advance Vari ation by showing that White could opt for slow and simple development with protection of the pawn-chain, usually by c3. This is in spite of the fact that Black has a 'good' French Defence due to the development of his bishop outside the pawn-chain. As it turns out, such an ab stract theoretical view doesn' t mean much in practice and there are cases when the bishop would be better-placed on d7. Short and others won various nice games until theory caught up and roughly evened things up. Today the same structure is widely seen, and the Short Variation itself has evolved, often involving .i.e3 instead of c3. Here's one of Short's original wins. It illustrates some of the underlying ideas and some that have more to do with pawn-chains as a whole. Short - Seirawan Manila IZ 1990 4 .•.e6 5 c3 c5 6 .i.e2 tt:'Bc6 7 O-O h6 8 .i.e3!

The Zviagintsev Variation ...�6 has to be answered should Black choose
4 Si.e3 (D)
This modern move (a typical case of bishop before-knight development) has several points. First, it helps to stop ...c5, which after all is Black's goal once he has played ... Si.f5, and all the more so after ...e6. It also directly protects d4, the main target of Black's attack. Moreover, a piece gets out that normally has difficulty doing so in the Advance Variation. Now the queen's knight can follow by moving to d2 and not interfere with that bishop, leaving the pawn moves c3 and c4 free to be played. Here you might compare 4 tt:'Bc3 above; one of the reasons that White must strike out with the early tactical move g4 in that line is that he is no longer able to play c3 and protect d4, so his centre is faced with demolition by ...c5 and ...cxd4. After 4 Si.e3, however, the option of c3 exists, or White can defend with pieces follow ing tt:'Bd2-b3 or he can counterattack by c4. On the kingside we have a somewhat similar situa tion, in that delaying tt:'Bf3 retains the option of f4, while the g4/h4 ideas that we see after 4 tt:'Bc3 are not ruled out. Eventually White will probably play Si.e2 and O-O, but he doesn't want to waste a precious tempo on those moves until it is necessary. As in so many openings today, White's underlying philosophy is one of flexi bility. There are of course drawbacks to all this, first and foremost that White is not granted two moves for every one of Black's, and can only implement these strategies one at a time! Fur thermore, there is the concrete problem that to play it within the next few moves. Let's re call again our idea about the early development of White' s dark-squared bishop: whenever that happens, Black should always consider target ing the queenside dark squares. That normally applies to Si.f4 or Si.g5, but there's no particular reason to reject the same thought after Si.e3 (al though at least White needn't worry as much about d4). The queen sortie to b6 also assists with ... c5 . So it is probably best played right away or early on, because given a little time White can play tt:'Bb3 or c3 and b4. Black, having been informed that a bishop is on e3, can also aim to put a knight on f5 or g4 and look for a favourable way to obtain the two bishops. One might want to compare all this to the Kupreichik line in the Advance French: 1 e4 e6 2 d4 d5 3 e5 c5 4 c3 tt:'Bc6 5 Si.e3. In that case, too, Black will often play ... tt:'ige7, aiming for . .. tt:'Bf5, or even more often ... tt:'Bh6 with the dual ideas ... tt:'Bf5 and ... tt:'Bh6. Of course there's much more in terms of strategy in this wonderfully complex line. The players' positional under standing will usually be put to the test, and therein lies the chance for a challenging and competitive game. We look at two games after 4 Si.e3: 4 . . .e6 (D) 5 tt:'Bd2 Shirov - Dreev Poikovsky 2006

1 e4 e6 the Queen's Gambit Declined ( 1 d4 d5 2 c4 e6),
Strictly speaking, this move defines the French Defence. However, I shall pass over White's second-move options, and get straight to the position that most players think of as the starting-off point.
2 d4 d5 (D)
The French Defence ranks behind only the Sicilian Defence and l ...e5 as a reply to 1 e4. It is hard to characterize in general terms since it combines highly tactical and ultra-positional types of play. But the French has one quality that few other openings have, and perhaps none to this extent: a persistence of central struc ture. In the main lines (mostly characterized by White's move e5), the fundamental formation of ...e6 and ... d5 has a tendency to last for many moves into the middlegame and fairly often into an endgame. The exceptions consist of variations with ...dxe4, which are proportion ately infrequent, and lines in which Black achieves the freeing move ...e5, something that White usually denies his opponent until the middlegame. This brings us right away to the main disad vantage of the French Defence, Black's light squared bishop. Whether that piece assumes a useful role can determine the success of the opening. We run into a similar phenomenon in where in most of the traditional lines the move ...e5 is needed to bring the c8-bishop into play. A significant exception in the Queen's Gambit occurs when the bishop is freed by White' s vol untary exchange on d5. The situation with the Semi-Slav ( 1 d4 d5 2 c4 c6 3 tt:'Bf3 tt:'Bf6 4 tt:'Bc3 e6) is obviously worse still. In any event, re turning to the matter of the French Defence, we find that if White advances his pawn to e5, the freeing move ... e5 becomes unlikely in the short term, so Black may try to develop his light squared bishop via . . .b6 and ... .i.a6. More often it stays on c8 or d7 for a while, perhaps await ing the move .. .f6, after which it plays a useful defensive role guarding e6. The bishop may later transfer to the kingside (g6 or h5) via e8. It' s interesting that the Sicilian Defence varia tions which include the moves ...d6 and ...e5 are a mirror image of certain Tarrasch French main lines, right down to the role of the bad bishop as protector of a backward d-pawn (in the Sicil ian) or a backward e-pawn (in the French); see the section on 3 tt:'Bd2 tt:'Bf6 for more about that remarkable comparison. Finally, Black's light squared bishop may go in the other direction to c6, b5 or a4. Where it ends up will reflect the pawn-structure and thus indicate the nature of the play. What else is going on in the initial position? On the most basic level, Black's second move of the French Defence attacks the e-pawn! Ac cording to the Hypermodern theorists, White's e4-pawn is too much of a target for 1 e4 to be a good move, and in fact Black puts the question to White, who has to choose between exchang ing the pawn, advancing it, protecting it, and gambiting it. We discuss this in the Introduc tion to the Semi-Open Games (Chapter 1 0). Looking over White's options against the French, we find: a) There is no realistic method of gambiting White's e4-pawn that doesn't leave him strug gling for equality.

b) Exchanging the d-pawns by 3 exds exds Tarrasch Variation (D) immediately frees Black's queen's bishop and dissipates White's advantage. This is called the Exchange Variation. 1 e4 e6 2 d4 dS 3 lbd2 (D) In spite of the symmetrical result of this ex change, a player on either side of the board who seeks a double-edged game will find it easy to do so. Not only are all the pieces on the board still present, but the only file down which rooks can penetrate is the e-file. However, the 5th, 6th and 7th ranks are thoroughly covered. This ne gates the need to put the rooks on an open file at all and allows them to support pawn advances on either wing. See theoretical books and mas ter practice to confirm this. c) The two most popular lines against the French Defence protect the e-pawn: 3 lDd2 and 3 lbc3. Those are what I'll be concentrating upon. Both moves are exceptionally rich in strategic concepts. Black's responses to the Tarrasch De fence (3 lbd2), for example, are diverse enough to cover in depth major subjects such as the iso lated queen's pawn, the central majority, and pawn-chains. And 3 lbc3 leads to some of the most complex play amongst the 1 e4 openings. d) The Advance Variation (3 e5) has some what narrower strategic scope, concentrated mainly around pawn-chains. I talked about 3 e5 at some length in Chapter 3. Since pawn-chains are also part of the Tarrasch, Classical and Winawer Variations, I've not dealt with the Ad vance Variation in this chapter. As always, it's better to study some variations in depth rather than all of them superficial! y, and I think the se lected variations have the most to offer in terms of chess understanding. This move defines the Tarrasch Variation, for many years considered White's safest choice and a good way to get a small advantage with out taking many chances. Most contemporary players have abandoned that point of view; it's now become obvious that White will have to risk something to gain something. However, as with all openings, White's rewards in these riskier variations are greater than in the old days, when he would end up in the superior po sition but in some drawish ending with his op ponent having one weak pawn or a bad bishop. What's the basic idea for White? First of all. convenience. White protects his e-pawn but avoids the annoying pin that occurs after 3 lbc3 .i.b4. Then there's flexibility. White can still play either e5 or exd5 (or sometimes dxc5) and doesn't commit himself until he sees what Black is doing. In that sense he gains the advantage of setting the agenda, at least in some main lines. If Black plays 3 ... lbf6, for example, it's pretty much compulsory to play 4 e5 if one wants an advantage, but after 4 ... lbfd7, there's already a choice between 5 f4 and 5 .i.d3, and in the latter case White has another choice after 5 ...c5 6 c3 lbc6, between 7 lbe2 and 7 lbgf3. Naturally Black has a few options too, but if he commits to 3 ... lbf6 they're not so bothersome during the first few moves. On the other hand, 3 ...c5 4 exd5 gives Black two main options, 4 ... exd5 and 4 ...�xd5. Ifhe so desires, White can play 4 lbgf3 and avoid the 4 ...�xd5 lines. Naturally
2 72 MASTERING THE CHESS OPENINGS
this comes at the cost of submitting to the ne cessity of other moves, and so forth - there are always trade-offs. We'll consider the most popular responses to 3 lbd2: the central counterattack 3 ...c5, and the provocative 3 ... lbf6, a variation featuring pawn-chains. I'll try to provide just enough de tail to communicate the primary ideas in each branch. Those two moves are still the main variations because they challenge the centre in a way that forces White to concede something and fix the structure. I'll concentrate on them for that reason. Nevertheless, I should say that 3 ... j_e7 has established itself as a main-line anti-Tarrasch weapon, and at this point of time 3 ... lbc6 gives every indication of becoming an alternative of equal worth to the others. Today, in fact, for the first time since the Tarrasch was introduced, strong players with Black are con sistently playing the moves 3 ... lbc6 (the Gui mard Variation) and 3 ... j_e7 (D), whereas even 3 ... h6! ? has been used with success by grand masters (although much less often). I think that there's a common idea here, namely, that the knight isn't that well-placed on d2! Can it really justify its position, blocking off the c l -bishop and queen? Clearly it will have to move again, and to a useful position. Which leads to the question: why bail it out? Why give it a useful role? Black's traditional 3rd moves do just that; for example, 3 ...c5 leads to lines such as 4 exd5 exd5 5 lDgf3 lDc6 6 j_b5 j_d6 7 dxc5 j_xc5 8 O-O lbge7 9 lbb3 ; in that variation the knight on d2 has become a superb one, gaining a tempo on Black's bishop and covering the d4-square, right in front of the isolani. Or consider 4 ...�xd5 5 lbgf3 cxd4 6 j_c4 �d6 7 O-O lDf6 8 lbb3, when the knight will capture on d4 with a centralized position. The old main line of 3 ... lDf6 4 e5 lDfd7 also justifies the knight's placement on d2; for ex ample, 5 j_d3 c5 6 c3 lbc6 7 lbe2 cxd4 8 cxd4 f6 9 exf6 lDxf6 10 lbf3 and White's pieces are coordinated, centralized, and aiming at the king side. Similarly, 5 f4 c5 6 c3 lbc6 7 lbdf3 shows the knight in a favourable light. If Black's newly-popular moves 3 ... j_e7 and 3 ... lbc6 have less positive effect on the game in terms of forcing the play, they also make it dif ficult for the d2-knight to do as much. More over, 3 ... j_e7 and 3 ... h6 (along with the mildly revived 3 ... a6) are the kind of useful waiting moves that we talk about in Chapter 2. Accord ingly, in spite of their own serious drawbacks (mainly the fact that they don't attack the centre as effectively in various situations), such third move alternatives deserve attention. I shall make a comparison between 3 ... lbf6 4 e5 lDfd7 and the Guimard line 3 ... lbc6 4 lbgf3 lDf6 5 e5 lbd7 below. Tarrasch with 3 . . . cs

Black challenges the centre immediately. The idea is twofold, depending upon what kind of position he wants and what White does. After 4 exd5 by White, Black can accept an isolated pawn by 4 ... exd5, or undertake to work with a central/kingside majority by means of 4 ... �xd5. I'll illustrate those options using games. 4 exd5

If he later captures on f3 and White recap tures with the queen, two fewer pieces will protect that crucially important square. In the meantime the pin is awkward to meet. 12 .i.e2 .i.hS This is a funny-looking retreat, but it makes sense to be able to avoid more exchanges by putting the bishop on g6.

In doing so he braves many attacking tries by White, whose lead in devel opment and tactical tricks were probably the reason that French Defence players were put
FRENCH DEFENCE 2 79
off this line for so many years. With more and more willingness to defend difficult positions in openings, players who recognized the very real advantages in Black's pawn-structure and his smooth development began to try out the line. A standard plan goes ... lbc6, ... lbf6, ... a6, ...°VJll. c7 and ... b5 with ... .i.b7, depending upon how much is permitted him. These are typical Sicilian ideas and, as in the Sicilian, players re alized that the pawn on e6 in particular makes Black's position hard to crack. White in turn uses his lead in development to restrict Black's own pieces from getting out by posting pieces on support-points like e5, still looking for and often finding attacking chances. For Black, it' s all about structure: White doesn't have a centre pawn to attack with, and his c- and f-pawns tend to take a long time to enter the fray. About 15 years ago this turned into the most popular line of the Tarrasch at the very top levels and it is still leading to great wins for both sides. We'll explore three games from this position.

Black has also played simply 14 ...O-O here, but that's risky. The text-move gets the queen off the d-file and gains a tempo by attacking White's g5-bishop. 15 h4! Or maybe he hasn't gained a tempo, since the h-pawn will be handy in an attack!

Black aims at White's kingside, but even more significantly, he stops .tf4, which effec tively exchanges Black's good bishop. This comes at the cost of committing the queen early on, which could be considered a relative loss of time. I'd guess that at least thousand pages of anal ysis (adding up all sources and annotations) have been devoted to the lines beginning with

It's a mirror image! Notice especially the roles of the bad bishops protecting backward pawns. The biggest difference in structure is Black's open f-file in the French Defence. He also has the opportunity to attack White's vul nerable d-pawn. Both of these are comparative advantages. But in the Sicilian Defence posi tion, Black has an important minority attack with ...a6 and ...b5, by which he gains space, at tacks the queenside, and helps with control of d5. In the French, Black has nothing of the sort; as such, his strategy is more piece-based, with moves like ... "file? (supporting the idea of . . .e5), ... tt:Jh5 (or ... tt:Jg4), intending to attack on the king side. And as long as we're digressing, a thought provoking comparison also arises between this sort of position and that of the Guimard De fence, 3 tLld2 tt:Jc6. It turns out that the lack of a c-pawn in our 3 tLld2 tLlf6 French Defence can be a disadvantage in comparison with the Gui mard! Let's look at a fairly normal example: Rasik - Cernousek Ostrava 2005

Let's look at a real game: 12 i.gS Biti - Gleizerov Zadar 2005 The main line, which has the logical idea of i.h4-g3 to exchange off that good bishop of Black's. Then White can start thinking about occupying the juicy outpost on e5 by means of l:.el . If Black plays ... e5 first, he gets saddled with an isolated queen's pawn and remember that they tend to be weaker after simplification, especially the exchange of the better bishop. That's White's general strategy, but of course it takes time. As explained after 1 1 ...O-O, Black tends to rely on piece-play, so he'll start putting everything close to the king, provoke weak nesses and then strongly consider ... e5 in order to bring the last pieces into the attack. 1 2 tllc3,

Still, in some respects Black calls the shots. As long as Black doesn't commit to a radical move right away, White needs a positive plan. He can't play tll b3 due to ... c4, and dxc5 gives up the centre. That means that a slow move by Black at this point could be the most effective course, as in the following game. Zhang Pengxiang - M.

f6 4 e5 lllfd7 5 f4 (D) White constructs a big centre, with the pawns forming a wedge that extends into Black's posi tion. The advantage is obvious: it's now ex tremely hard to break down the front of the pawn-chain, which is always the essence of Black's strategy in the .ltd3 lines. The moves ...f6 and .. .fxe5 can be answered by fxe5 (or in fewer cases by dxe5, which cedes the c5-square to Black's pieces). I'll concentrate on this d4/e5/f4 pawn-chain structure here and in the Classical French because it's different from most other pawn-chains in this book. The only other major opening with similar properties is the King's Indian Defence with pawns on e4, d5 and c4, and Black's treatment in that open ing is radically different from what we shall see in the French Defence. White's strategy has one major drawback: he has to make so many pawn moves, not only these first four but also c3 and usually g3 and/or h4. Even a3 and b4 are part of a typical forma tion. Because of this it turns out that Black can almost inevitably sacrifice something in the centre to open up attacking lines for his better developed pieces. The result is often a confused disarray of pieces and threats, with White try ing to defend an exposed king against Black's open lines and advanced centre. Of course, there are two possible outcomes in White' s favour . Either the sacrifice isn't possible, when White will almost always enjoy a large, cramping space advantage and potential attacks on both wings. Or Black' s sacrifice may prove insuffi cient for equality. Ensuring such a result takes a lot of accuracy on White's part, however, and many players seem to have grown tired of be ing on the receiving end of brilliancies. The normal and logical response to 5 f4 is to attack the d-pawn with 5 ...c5. As a mini-rule. we can generalize that attacking the front of a double-winged pawn-chain like this with ... f6 is best delayed until some of your other pieces are out. You might compare the King's Indian c4/d5/e4 double-wing, in which ...c6 can be very useful, but doesn't usually occur until Black has castled. Nevertheless, you will see that eventually ...f6 will be essential to open counterattacking lines. 5 ••• c5 6 c3 I should mention that 5 c3 c5 6 f4 is another move-order that reaches this position. 6 ... lllc6 7 llldf3 This is played in the great majority of games.

All these pawn moves can be a little slow. White's got a lot of space on the kingside and might want to use a move to secure it. With that in mind, he could simply allow Black to get ...a4 in and let him try to infiltrate on the queen side; even if he gets a piece to b3 it doesn't look as though Black would get anything useful out of it.

296 MASTERING THE CHESS OPENINGS
It's now or never. That's about all you need to know about these lines when playing Black: if you don't sacrifice at an early stage, you'll probably never be able to sacrifice later! White will just have too many pieces covering all the key squares and then you'll die slowly, waiting around as he slowly advances on your cramped position. If you're handling the white pieces, the sac rifices are also about all that you need to know ! If you can prevent those, the rest won't be diffi cult. So try to set up your pieces for maximum post-sacrifice defence, as Anand has tried to do here by playing l:.h3 and lt'ieg l , both designed to overprotect the f3-square, which is generally the most vulnerable target. It pays off for him in this game. 16 dxeS lt'ixeS 17 lt'ixeS 'iVxeS+ (D) 18 'iVe2 i..xh4+!? Shirov pours more gasoline on the fire.

We are going to concentrate upon the main line, which is marked by the advance. 4 e5 Easily the most ambitious move, restricting Black's development and staking out territory on the side of the board that Black's dark squared bishop has just abandoned. Various other lines may be found in the books, several of them involving the sacrifice of White's e-pawn with subsequent recovery.

Black decides to attack the base of the pawn chain first. He will almost inevitably attack the front of it later. 5 a3 White wants to force a decision by Black's bishop; you'll have to check theoretical works and databases in order to find out about the alter natives. Of these, 5 dxc5 and 5 .ltd2 are perhaps the most interesting. If you are not inclined to play the main lines presented below, this may be a good place to investigate potential weap ons for use. The defender, of course, should be aware of and prepared for White's various 4th and 5th-move alternatives. 5 • • • .ltxc3+ Black cedes the bishop-pair to White in or der to gain a tempo and inflict doubled pawns on his opponent. 5 ... .lta5 is a respectable option played by some specialists, but isn't nearly as popular; we'll pass that by. 6 bxc3 llle7 (D) 6 ...

It is my belief that the most instructive and engrossing lines follow from the positions after 6 ... llle7. At this j uncture, White chooses between the Positional variations, involving the moves lll f3, a4 and/or h4 in various orders, and the 'French Poisoned Pawn Variation' 7 'iVg4. Positional Variations In this section we'll look at lines in which White bypasses tactics for a while and tries to establish a positional edge. In spite of initial ap pearances, both players will use both sides of the board to generate play. We'll look at a series of games beginning with 7 h4 and 7 lllf3.
7 h4 (D)
With this move White charges forward to as sault Black's position, not caring about piece development. He has several ideas, beginning
300 MASTERING THE CHESS OPENINGS
with h5-h6 to compromise Black' s kingside. Black' s kingside dark squares are already weak ened due to the loss of his f8-bishop, so if White can establish holes on f6 and h6 it will not only give him good squares for his pieces, but also discourage Black from attacking on the king side. White' s advantage in space is on the kingside, and h4 only enhances that advan tage. Other matters of note, many of which apply to the Winawer in general: a) White has the two bishops; b) The pawn advance h4-h5 makes kingside castling very difficult for Black, and almost compels ...O-O-O; c) The rook's pawn advance doesn't block off White's queen as lines with tll f3 do, so 'i¥'g4 is always an issue; d) White has a potentially strong resource in l:.h3-g3/f3 or l:.h4-g4/f4, the latter rook move also introducing the possibility of dxc5 and l:.hb4 for attack. Black's main advantage is less subtle: a growing lead in development. It's quite possi ble that he'll have every piece except one of his rooks in action when White still only has one piece out! White also has weak doubled pawns on his c-file, with the usual problem that if Black exchanges pawns on d4 White gets rid of his doubled pawns only to find that his remain ing backward c-pawn on an open file can be as least as much a problem as the doubled pawns. In general, Black would like to exploit White's queenside light-square weaknesses on c4 and a4. Finally, Black can usually open files on the kingside, after which his rooks directly face White's king. There are many other positional and tactical issues and I shall discuss as many as possible in context. 7 .•. tll bc6 8 hS 'iY'aS Black attacks White's c-pawn and, inciden tally, threatens ... tllxd4. 9 ild2 (D) 9 'i¥'d2? cxd4 1 0 cxd4 'i¥'xd2+ and 1 1 ... tllxd4 wins the d-pawn.

A funny position because Black's doubled h-pawns are so weak on an open file and White apparently controls the kingside. But Black finds

a remarkable idea after which both players have the opportunity to play on both sides of the board! In fact that' s often the case in the Winawer. Although White has space on the kingside, Black can counter with .. .f6 and open lines for his pieces there. And Black's attack on White's weak queenside squares can boomer ang when White uses the b-file and dynamic pawn moves on that side of the board including c4, a4-a5, and sometimes dxc5.

c3 i.b4 4 e5 lll e7 5 a3 i.xc3+ 6 bxc3 c5 7 'i¥g4 (D) The grand old flagship of the Winawer Vari ation. White wants to exploit Black's lack of the dark-squared bishop by direct means. He will try to get Black to weaken himself or castle into a potential attack. It makes sense to work on the side of the board where he has space and to wards which his bishops aim. In addition, the e5-pawn cramps Black in that part of the board. As is true in the positional lines, White would love to get rid of the g-pawn so that his unop posed dark-squared bishop can have a field day on squares like h6 and f6. For his part Black's first goal is to attack White's centre and queenside, where White al ready has serious weaknesses. Ironically, how ever, he usually ends up playing on the kingside too, whether or not he castles in that direction. The key move is .. .f6, which helps defensively but also gives him central threats and a very useful f-file. In any case, Black' s first decision is whether to gambit the pawn by 7 ... 'i¥c7, or play 7 ...O-O and hang on to his material for a while. The latter is the preferred choice these days but it' s not clear that the former won't come back into fashion. As in so many lines of the French Defence, one notices the persistence of the central pawn structure. This gives both the positional and tactical themes a certain logical consistency, al though it doesn't seem to limit their variety. The Gambit 7• • •'i¥c7 8 'iVxg7 .l:!.g8 9 'iVxh7 Now in addition to the other advantages listed above, White has a passed h-pawn.

Their real strength appears in simplified positions and, of course, as outside passed pawns in an ending. 9•••cxd4 10 lll e2 (D) Other moves like 10 @dl are possible, yet this is how they've played it for 50 years in the vast majority of games.

11...jg,d7 12 'iVd3 dxc3 13 'iVxc3 (D)
Simply recapturing the c3-pawn is very pop ular, since it has both a cramping effect and at tacking strengths. On the other hand, the c-file is open for Black's rooks. There are many other moves here such as 1 3 I:Ibl, 1 3 I:Igl and 1 3 lll xc3. Let's take stock. White's advantages are pretty obvious: he has cleared out the kingside, which for one thing means that the move .. .f6 (to undermine his centre) would be unsupported by a pawn. His bishop-pair can be usefully placed on d3 and e3 for both attack and de fence, although the dark-squared bishop can be a target in that case. A bishop on a3 would be wonderful but generally it's just too hard to achieve. In view of this his most potent posi tional threat is to expand on the kingside by means of g4 (preceded by either h3 or I:Ig 1 ). That would deny Black's knight the powerful f5-square. Alternatively, White can try to play g3, jg,g2 and O-O; that arrangement of pieces is another trade-off because when the bishop moves off its original diagonal White tends to be subject to central and queenside attack. Finally, we shouldn't forget that h-pawn. If White can get bishops to d3 and f6, then Black will at the very least have to devote several pieces in an attempt to stop it from marching up the board and promoting. What is Black doing in the meantime? He has sacrificed a pawn, apparently in order to get at White's queenside and gain development. That lead in development is absolutely critical because if he waits too long for White to get his position organized (and especially to get his bishops out!) he will have little to counter White's space, extra pawn, and bishop-pair. Fortunately, his knights at the moment are very well-placed and influential. It' s a kind of semi closed position in which for now the knights are superior to bishops. He also has play down the c-, g- and h-files, whereas right now White isn't using his king' s bishop or rook at all. Is that enough to make up for White's own advan tages? Probably not, except that White also has isolated c- and a-pawns, and hasn't castled. Note too that there is an important interior weaknesses on e3, a square that can be an chored by ...d4 and is particularly vulnerable to a knight on f5 and a queen on b6. Generally speaking, White' s advantages, if he can keep them, are probably the better ones in the long term, so you will usually find Black trying to upset the equilibrium in the near term. All in all one can see why players would be willing to take both sides of this position. 13 ••• tt:Jrs A multipurpose move that holds off ctJd4 and controls e3. This introduces the idea of ...

kingside, almost always by means of ...f6 or ...f5. He retains the option of ...c4 (keeping White' s bishop away from d3) or ... cxd4 (at tacking the centre). The drawback of 7 ...

The attack can be supple mented by h4-h5 and .l:.h3, or by f4, assuming that White's knight has moved. Now 8 i.d3, bringing the bishop to d3 before deciding upon anything else, is the overwhelm ing favourite. 8 Cllf3 is the most natural move, but was put under a cloud by several games, in cluding the following: Roth - Kindermann Vienna 1996

But the most interesting feature of these games is that there are dozens of consis tently recurring tactical themes that stem from the nature of the underlying position, that is, from the pawn-structure. Thus the term 'char acteristic tactics' applies to these and other Winawer lines as much as to any other in chess. The wonderful part is that so many basic types of tactics mixed with creative thinking can generate a near-infinite number of combina tive possibilities. 1 4 Pirc Defence
1 e4 d6 2 d4 tZ:lf6 (D)
This is the Pirc Defence, an opening plenti ful in useful strategic ideas. With l ...d6 Black restrains White's e-pawn in preparation for 2 ... tZ:lf6, 3 ...g6 and 4 ... .tg7, much as in the tra ditional King's Indian Defence ( 1 d4 tZ:lf6 2 c4 g6 3 tZ:lc3 .tg7 4 e4 d6). The immediate differ ence is that White doesn't have time for c4 in the Pirc. Before we move on to alternatives and move orders, let's examine some characteristics of the opening. In the great majority of cases, the first moves are 1 e4 d6 2 d4 (setting up the ideal cen tre) 2 ... tZ:lf6 3 tZ:lc3 (see alternatives below) 3 ...g6 (D), when we have arrived at the basic position. By way of comparison with the King's In dian Defence, White has omitted the move c4 in favour of tZ:lc3. How does this influence the play? First of all, the d4-square is theoretically stronger than in the King's Indian, because it can be supported by c3. In reality, defending d4 still turns out to be a problem for White after moves like ... e5 and/or ... tZ:lc6 (in some cases supported by ... .tg4), because it's not so easy to redirect the c3-knight without losing too much time. Furthermore, if White plays d5 (say, in re sponse to ...e5 or ...c5), that pawn lacks the sup port of White's c-pawn. Black also has some queenside attacking ideas that may not be as ef fective in the King's Indian; for example, ...c6 and ... a6, both intending ...b5. Let's continue with the comparison by look ing at the positive side of White's position. First, 3 tZ:lc3 is a developing move, unlike c4 in the King's Indian. Traditionally, development of knights to c3 and f3 is the best way of arrang ing your pieces when you have an ideal centre. By playing 3 tZ:lc3, White also gives himself leeway to try more ambitious moves after 3 ...g6 such as 4 f4. In the King's Indian Defence this advance is playable and more menacing (4 e4 d6 5 f4 is the Four Pawns Attack), but it is also riskier because White has made so many pawn moves and he has a broader centre to defend. In the Pirc Defence, the main line with 4 tZ:lf3 yields a solid, classically centralized position. White has aggressive piece deployments avail able such as .tc4 or .te3 in combination with �d2. Direct moves such as these are generally easier to implement than in the King's Indian because the Pirc centre is not quite as vulnera ble to ... c5 and ... e5 moves (which is not to say that those moves won't be played). Notice that the move-order 1 d4 d6 2 e4 tZ:lf6 also lands us in a Pirc Defence. White of course has some good alternatives in that case, such as
2 c4 and 2 tZ:lf3, but 2 ...tZ:lf6 is perfectly viable
against those moves as well, possibly leading into a version of the King's Indian Defence.
314 MASTERING THE CHESS OPENINGS
Black can go his own way with things like I d4 d6 2 c4 e5 or I d4 d6 2 'Lif3 .tg4 ! ? . A great deal of theory now exists on these and related posi tions. We've come a long way from the days of a near-compulsory I e4 e5 and I d4 d5. 3 'Lic3 White plays the most natural and important move, defending the attacked pawn. The Pirc is one of those openings in which the early op tions are instructive, so we'll look at a couple over the next few moves. Here 3 .td3 is some times played, intending to enter into a system with c3 and perhaps 'Lie2. There's nothing wrong with that, of course, but apart from the normal and good 3 ...g6 it allows Black to strike out in the centre immediately by 3 ...e5. Then 4 c3 allows the cute idea 4 ... d5 ! . It's a case of "If you don't want to take the centre, I shall !'' I've discussed this position briefly in Chapter 3 (un der 'Cross-Pollination'). Let me repeat and ex pand upon that exposition. After 3 .td3 e5 4 c3 d5, we find that it's a great asset to know about a wide variety of chess positions and themes. Chemin did a fascinating analysis of 4 ...d5, which I've abbreviated and modestly revised. The play will usually continue 5 dxe5 'Lixe4
(D).
In Chapter 3, we already looked at White's option 6 .txe4 dxe4 7 'iVa4+ (7 'iVxd8+ @xd8 gives Black the two bishops and active play; e.g., 8 ..Bf4 'Lid7 9 'Lid2 'Lic5) 7 ... .td7 8 'iVxe4 .tc6. The position is similar to pawn sacrifices made in various openings. Here 9 'iVg4 is forced, when 9 ... 'iVd7 ! is very strong: 1 0 'iVg3 ( I O 'iVxd7+ 'Lixd7 1 1 'Lif3 .txf3 1 2 gxf3 'Lixe5 1 3 Qe2

But let's continue with a better and more re alistic way for White to develop: 6 'Lif3 'Lic6 7 O-O (7 'iVe2 'Lic5 8 .tc2 .tg4! ; a high-level en counter Yusupov-Adams, Hastings 1 989/90 went 7 'Libd2 'Lic5 8 'Lib3 ..Bg4 { or 8 ...

(D), which helps to control d4 and in many cases is fol lowed by ...d4 or even ... 'Lie6 and ...d4. In fact, the only difference between the two lines is Black's insertion of ...a6 and ... b5 in the Ruy Lopez version. Without entering into yet

another digression, I'll just say that this has both positive and negative features. 3• . •g6 Here there's an important transposition 3 . .. e5 4 ll'Bf3 lt'ibd7, when we're in a Philidor De fence! What's more, this is arguably the only safe way to get to this version of the Philidor because 1 e4 e5 2 lt'Bf3 d6 3 d4 ll'Bf6 allows 4 dxe5 ll'Bxe4 5 °iYd5, which is not to everyone's taste. Details about this and associated move order issues can be found in Chapter 7. We shall now move on to a discussion of the main lines of the Pirc. Austrian Attack
4 f4 (D)
As I've pointed out with many examples at the very beginning of Chapter 3 on pawn-struc tures, the first reaction to 'unusual' defences that cede the centre is generally to throw as many pawns forward as possible and push the opponent off the board. The Pirc was infre quently played and generally held in low regard until the mid- l 960s, and indeed this response dominated early theory.
4. ..
.tg7 Before moving on to the main line 5 lt'Bf3, played in thousands of games, let's see if we can understand what the relation between this structure and pawn advances might be. Austrian Attack with 5 e5
5 e5 (D)
What about advancing right away? You won't find much in the books about this, and it's easy to say that 5 e5 is too ambitious, especially since it resembles other openings in which rash pawn attacks are insufficiently supported and expose the centre. But it's another thing to show that. Let's do our own analysis and per haps pick something up about how to study an opening while we're at it. As we know, varia tions that are not highly respected are often the most instructive. Let's look at two answers to 5 e5 as representative of typical ideas in the Aus trian Attack:
A: 5 •..
ll'ifd7
B: 5 ...
dxe5
A)
5 • . • lt'ifd7 This is a dynamic move in the spirit of the Pirc, avoiding simplification and accepting the challenge. The positions that result are little explored and instructive to investigate. 6 ll'Bf3 c5! The recommended continuation for Black. It's consistent to destroy White's centre before he consolidates; of course, that depends upon the outcome! This line transposes into 5 ll'Bf3 c5 6 e5 lt'ifd7. By the 5 e5 move-order, White has avoided a few of Black's options along the way. 7 lt'Bg5!? This odd sortie may well be the best move, although 7 .tc4 could use more investigation. Positions with a knight on d7 and the possibil ity of the move e6 are notoriously tactical, so the move 7 lt'Bg5 is likely to occur to you if you've run across such positions before.

Naturally both sides have a lot of other options along the way, and it's unlikely that White can actually force an advantage in this line. But the characteristics of the position are what count here, and they can only be indicated by analysis (which in this case is a lot of fun). Mainly, I wanted to show that it's easy to dismiss 'premature' attacks on principle without testing whether the principle in question applies to a specific position (or even whether it is valid at all). 8) 5 .•.dxe5 6 fxe5!? lt'Bd5 7 ll'Bf3 (D) White retains his centre. Then we have Black's bishop looking rather restricted on g7. An apparently logical move is: 7 •.•f6?

8 exf6 White makes his usual response to .. .f6. The recapture 8 ... ..Bxf6 would leave Black with a weak isolated e-pawn on an open file; then 9 ctJe4, 9 ..Bc4 and 9 ..Bh6 are all good moves.

In general, 5 ... dxe5 may leave something to be desired; it illustrates the dangers of early simplification when the opponent commands more space. What have we learned by this exercise? For one thing, White seems to have more positive chances after 5 e5 than indicated by what little existing theory is devoted to it. More signifi cantly, we see how one might go about investi gating a position on one's own, and how helpful it is to have general knowledge about structures and their characteristic properties. The Austrian Attack Main Line: 5 ll'Bf3 5 lt'Bf3 (D) With this natural move we return to normal theory. Now in the face of 6 e5 (or 6 .ltd3 and 7 e5), Black has two logical reactions, the natural de veloping move 5 ...O-O and the central counter attack 5 ...c5. We'll try to understand each.

The move's main drawback, obviously, is that the knight is far from the centre and cannot be fully effective in that area of the board. As an instructive les son in positional themes you couldn't do better than to study this variation.
7 O-O c5 8 d5
Since 8 ...cxd4 was a positional threat, and since 8 dxc5 lll xc5 brings the knight into the centre with an easy game, White tries to take the c5-square away from the knight and cramp Black's position at the same time. If he gets the chance he will simply forge ahead with his cen tral pawns by e5 and drive Black back, or he might play for f5 in conjunction with moves like Wke 1 -h4. This is all quite dangerous. For the moment, however, it is premature for White to play 8 e5? lllg4! 9 h3 cxd4 10 lll e2 llle3 ! . See how the centre keeps collapsing in these extended-centre lines? White should also avoid 8 .Bxa6? ! cxd4! 9 lll xd4 bxa6 (D). We talk about doubled a-pawns at several points in this book. Generally speaking, the sur render of one's light-squared bishop and ceding of the b-file is a poor deal. Here White's sound position should balance out those advantages; e.g., 1 0 Wkd3 with the idea of Whl and .Be3, or perhaps .Bd2. But L.Barczay-Sandor, Hungary 1 968 showed how easily the active black pieces can create threats: 10 lll b3? a5 ! 1 1 Wkf3 .Bb7 12 a4? (but 12 .Be3 a4 1 3 llld2 a3!) 12 ...

White loses a pawn, and Black stands to win. 8 ... .Bg4 (D) A position with some curious features has arisen. It's often the case that if Black tries to
322 MASTERING THE CHESS OPENINGS
play a Benoni structure when White has a knight on c3 and no pawn on c4, he can't drum up much play on either side of the board. The key move ... b5 is hard to get in before White's cen tre starts rolling. But in this case the elimination of White' s f3-knight not only takes the pressure off e5, but gets rid of the c8-bishop, which is of ten in the way (for example, it interferes with the connection of Black' s rooks). Now Black' s plan will be ... !Dc7, ... a6, ... .l:i.b8 and ... b5, sup- ported by ... Wkd7 or ... !De8-c7 if necessary. Bar- ring that, the move ...e6 may undermine White's centre. Of course, White will have the consid erable advantage of the bishop-pair to compen sate him for these troubles. 9 a3 A few other instructive excerpts: a) 9 Whl e6! ? (not the only move, of course) 1 0 dxe6 fxe6 1 1 f5 !

Black has the bishop-pair and a central majority with a nice f-file. On the other hand, White has a space advantage and Black's squares down the e-file are vulnerable, while at the same time White's knights are nicely cen tralized. Probably it's one of those many chess positions in which, if the owner of the two bish ops (Black) can stabilize the position and avoid serious weaknesses, Illscentre and bishop-pair will assert themselves in the long run. But White looks ready to use his knights and major pieces along the open e-file to prevent that. 6 °iVe2 c6 Black can't stop e5, but this stabilizes the centre.
