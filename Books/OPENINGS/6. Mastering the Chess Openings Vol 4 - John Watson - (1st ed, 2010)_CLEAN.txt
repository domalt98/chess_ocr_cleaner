The result is a mix of modern strategies, old-fashioned approaches, and unconventional schemes in the openings. I supplement this with a detailed discussion of choosing and preparing openings, including ways to improve your play, and, finally, I indulge in a bit of philosophy to round things out. Specifically, the first two chapters are devoted to an investigation of the Reti System, I ttJf3, which is a logical complement to the 1 e4, 1 d4 and I c4 of the previous volumes. Later on, in the context of reversed openings, I look into I ttJf3 again, in the form of the King's Indian Attack. The next two chapters concentrate upon the fianchetto, with its advantages and disadvantages. His- torically, the subject of the fianchetto and its consequences was the last broad strategic area to be in- vestigated by chess-players; although now used routinely in conventional openings, the fianchetto is still associated with modern and non-traditional systems. In this volume, I've put particular em- phasis on these, including 1...g6, 1...b6 and 1 b3, with a detailed discussion of the first two. These variations are late bloomers (their general acceptance dates from approximately 15 to 40 years ago, depending upon the specific lines), but they have strong grandmaster advocates and I feel that they merit serious treatment. The double fianchetto is also a part of modem chess, and I shall discuss its use under more conventional circumstances, such as the Reti Opening, Dutch Defence and Sym- metrical English. The strategic ideas expressed in fianchetto openings tend to repeat themselves; by familiarizing yourself with them, you will also improve your understanding of the related sys- tems in previous volumes. This series doesn't attempt to investigate all openings, preferring to concentrate upon those which are the most useful for average players in terms of explanation and instruction. By this point, however, quite a high percentage of important systems have been examined and, happily, this vol- ume covers a number of gaps from the first three in the context of wider themes. For example, just as 1 ttJf3 is new to this volume, so are the f-pawn openings 1 f4 and 1...f5. They are examined in a chapter about reversed openings, with the Dutch Defence (1 d4 f5) receiving extensive treatment. Similarly, the Petroff Defence and the Four Knights Opening are analysed within the broader topic of symmetrical systems. The Benko Gambit, another mainstream opening, is explored as part of a lengthy chapter on gambits. As a teacher, I've become convinced of the practical value of traditional gambits for the developing player. Referring to his refusal to take them seriously as a young player, Alex Yer- molinsky says: "The hard work I had to put up to overcome this case of arrested development ... could have been easily avoided if I had given myself a little practice [with gambits] in my younger days." Thinking along those lines, I investigate 'primitive' attacking variations such as the Goring Gambit, Milner-Barry Gambit and Morra Gambit, in addition to various positionally-based gam- bits in major openings. The use of moves and variations previously looked upon as inferior is on the rise. Accordingly, I've spent a chapter investigating the appeal, benefits and drawbacks of so-called 'irregular' open- ings. Of course, it's impossible to address the vast assortment of unconventional openings because there are so many of them, each with their own peculiar theory (in both senses of that word!). Four volumes may seem like a lot, but a truly encyclopaedic coverage of openings - one that includes both fundamental ideas and an acceptable level of detail - is well outside of the bounds of even a much longer work. In any case, I expect that you will enjoy the discussion of initial moves, ranging from the almost-normal I b4 and 1 ttJc3 to the absurd 1 h4. On the black side, I have surveyed the
INTRODUCTION 11
'universal' systems associated with 1...d6 and 1...tDc6, to which considerable attention has been devoted in recent years. The ideas expressed are also 'universal', in the sense that both the struc- tures and strategies strongly overlap with those of mainstream openings. In the first two volumes of this series, my general approach was to give broad and instructive ex- amples without becoming too entwined in details. For many of the currently contested English Opening systems in Volume 3, however, I made extensive theoretical investigations, and was able to contribute much that was new. In this volume, I find that the existing theory on many of the lesser-played variations is strange and limited, so it has been easy add my own suggestions, correc- tions and analysis throughout. The reader can do the same, that is, expand upon theory and find new paths through these little-explored regions. That's where the fun comes in. As in previous volumes, I've focused upon move-order issues to a greater extent than most open- ing book authors do. In my own and my students' playing experience, their neglect has caused a lot offrustration and sometimes inferior results. You're probably familiar with the experience of head- ing for your favourite opening, when suddenly your opponent exploits a tricky move-order and di- verts you into a line with which you're unfamiliar and/or uncomfortable. I'd rather bore the reader with tiresome details than allow those moments to occur too frequently. At some point, you actually have to decide which openings to choose, and what to do with them. I've devoted a lengthy chapter to opening selection, preparation and study, with concrete methods of improving your opening play. In my experience, how to go about these things depends upon your playing level, something that isn't always taken into account. Hopefully my many years as a chess teacher will be helpful in that regard. I've tried to reach a very broad audience, from the developing student to the relatively sophisti- cated and experienced player looking for new ideas and analysis. I hope there is enough of value here to assist both of them in becoming better players.
1 Reti: Open and Closed Variations
tlbf3(D)
B
We begin this last volume by exploring the move I lbf3 and the Reti Opening. Right off, I lbf3 develops a piece towards the centre and prevents 1.. .eS. It resembles I c4 in that it leaves open major decisions about what kind of centre White wants to build; for example, he can still play c4, d4 and e4 in any combination. This gives him the choice of transposing into other openings depending upon what Black does. For instance, by playing I lbf3 White may simply be side-stepping I c4 eS while heading for an English Opening via 1 lbf3 cS 2 c4. In other cases, he may be preparing to enter
1 d4 systems; for example, I lbf3 dS 2 d4 or 1
lbf3 lbf6 2 d4, leading to a number of other d4 openings. 1 lbf3 cS 2 e4 is a Sicilian Defence, and you will also find 1 lbf3 as the introduction to the King's Indian Attack, which consists of the additional moves g3, .Bg2, O-O and d3 (see Chapter 6). The name 'Reti Opening' is used to describe different variations depending upon which book you're reading. As I define it, the Reti Opening arises after 1 lbf3 dS 2 c4, although those moves don't have to be played immedi- ately. That is, in order for the opening to be a Reti, White has to play lbf3 and c4, and Black ... dS. To distinguish the Reti further from other openings, I'll stipulate that White doesn't play d4 at an early stage (that is, not before White completes most of his development). In the vast majority of cases, he fianchettoes one or both of his bishops. In fact, some books examine only variations with the double fianchetto, as prac- tised by the opening's most famous advocate, Richard Reti himself. I'll include positions with a single fianchetto or no fianchetto at all if they are relevant to specific move-orders. t ... dS This is Black's normal path to the Reti Open- ing. After 1 lbf3, the players can also arrive at variations of the Reti by 1...e6 2 c4 dS or 1...c6
2 c4 dS. Of course, Black has many other possi-
bilities' such as 1... lbf6, when 2 g3 bS!? is an example of the kind of leeway that Black is given by the non-committal 1 lbf3. Black fre- quently plays 1...cS, when he is probably hop- ing for 2 e4 (a Sicilian Defence) or 2 c4 (a Symmetrical English Opening). If White re- plies to 1. .. cS with 2 g3, the game might con- tinue in any number of directions; for example, a King's Indian Attack (after .Bg2, O-O and d3), a Symmetrical English Opening (after c4), or, less frequently, a Closed Reti Variation (with ... cS, ... e6 and ... dS in response to White's c4 and a fianchetto on either wing; see below). Other nuances are best shown by example.
2 c4 (D)

RETI: OPEN AND CLOSED VARIATIONS 13
White attacks the centre. As described above, he will fianchetto one or both bishops, with g3 & .tg2 and b3 & .tb2 in the majority of varia- tions. Most openings, even those of a largely positional nature, contain several major lines that are unavoidably tactical. The Reti Opening is an exception, in that almost all its set-ups in- volve long-term manoeuvring. Because White avoids moving a centre pawn, there tends to be little early contact between the opposing forces. White fails to provide Black a target, and with some exceptions Black will also avoid too ag- gressive a commitment of his pieces. In most important variations, Black does establish a sig- nificant pawn presence in the centre. White's strategy is to snipe at his opponent from the wings, and eventually to expand on the queen- side or in the centre. In broader terms, this is the 'hypermodern' strategy, a name which proba- bly needs updating, since it came into general usage in the 1920s! After 2 c4, the game can still transpose into other openings, of course, notably if White plays d4. Since each variation leads to distinct positional themes, I'll discuss them as we go along. The 2 ... d4 Advance w Khuzman - A. Mikhalevski Beersheba 1993 Ilbf3 d5 2 c4 d4 (D) This aggressive push is one of the traditional and most important replies to the Reti Opening, and has always had a good reputation. In fact, some players prefer to make the Reti move c4 only after Ilbf3 d5 2 g3 e6 3 c4 or, say, Ilbf3 d5 2 g3 c6 3 c4 (or, if he doesn't want to gambit his c-pawn, he will wait with c4 for a few moves), or after an early b3 and .tb2. Black's motivation with 2 ... d4 is territorial gain. You may recognize that this position bears a close resemblance, with colours reversed, to the Modem Benoni (1 d4 lbf6 2 c4 c5 3 d5) should Black play ... c5 next; and to the Schmid Benoni (1 d4lbf6 2lbf3 c5 3 d5 and 4lbc3) if Black plays ... lbc6 (without ... c5). In several variations we shall see illustrations of reversed positions in which White's extra tempo gives Black the information that he needs to adjust strategies and maintain equality. That trade-off has been a theme throughout these volumes, and is explicitly featured in Chapter 6. 3g3 An obvious alternative is 3 e3 (D), introduc- ing one of the very few Reti Opening lines in which White will not normally fianchetto a bishop as part of his strategy.
B
This e-pawn advance isn't seen as much as 3 g3 in grandmaster play because Black is thought to gain an uncontroversial equality. On the other hand, the resulting play has enough substance to keep good players interested: a) 3 ... c5 4 exd4 cxd4 5 d3 is a reversed Benoni, intending g3 and .tg2. That opening boasts of dynamic options versus almost any set-up, so it's probably best for Black to avoid it when he is a tempo behind. b) 3 ... dxe3 has been a bit underrated. To be sure, after 4 fxe3 Black has surrendered the
14 MASTERING THE CHESS OPENINGS
centre to White (who has a 2-1 majority), but a d3/e3 pawn-formation isn't terribly impressive unless the pawns can both advance. The stan- dard line is 4 ... g6 S d4 i..g7 6 lDc3, and now 6 ... lDh6!? has the idea of ... lDfS, so Gausel- Mortensen, Copenhagen 1996 continued 7 e4!?
(D).

After 7 ... O-O!? (7 ... cS would attack the vul- nerable d4-square at the cost of a cramped game following 8 dS) 8 i..e2!? (8 i..f4) 8 ... i..g4 9 i..e3 (9 dS) 9 ... i..xf3? (9 ... fS is best) 10 gxf3 White threatened 11 1i'd2, winning the knight. Then Dunnington suggests 1O ... eS 11 dS fS, but 12 h4 looks extremely strong, with space, two bish- ops and an attack. Obviously, both sides have many options in such flexible positions. c) The simplest course is 3 ... lDc6 4 exd4 lDxd4 SlDxd4 'ii'xd4 6lDc3 (D).
B
White has failed to get an advantage here for many years, although there is plenty of content in the position, and play for both sides. I'll just show an excerpt from the most popular modern main line: 6 ... c6 (preventing lDbS or lDdS; 6 ... eS
7 d3 lDe7 has been played for at least 70 years
without being completely resolved; it's fair to say that the game is unbalanced but equal) 7 d3 lDh6!? (headed for fS) 8 i..e3 (after 8 i..e2, 8 ... lDfS 9 g4lDh4 10 l::tgi is a known line; then 1O .. :i!t'd6 11 l::tg3 eS 12 lDe4 1i'd8 is unclear; Black has also played 8 ... g6) 8 ... 1i'd8 9 i..xh6!? gxh6 10 d4 i..g7 11 dS, Zviagintsev-Granda, Pamplona 1995/6. Here Black's bishop on g7 compensates for his weaknesses; he can play, for example, Il...1i'd6 or Il...1i'b6. We now return to 3 g3 (D):
B
3 ... lDc6 This is easily Black's most popular move, but not his only one. a) 3 ... cS is playable, giving White an inter- esting decision. He can play 4 b4, with a re- versed, tempo-up Benko Gambit. This is an appealing practical choice, because the tempo is definitely helpful in most, if not all, lines. Moreover, the variation is more difficult for Black to play than White. It would be a useful exercise for the reader to compare the position after 4 b4 with the Benko Gambit itself, which is dealt with in Chapter S. White's other main option is 4 i..g2 lDc6 S O-O eS 6 d3. Then he usually plays the moves e3, lDa3-c2, l::teI, a3 and l::tbi in some order, in order to chip away at Black's centre by b4 and a timely exd4. Black can counter with any of several formations, but one consistent feature of the position is that exd4 gives Black the option of ... exd4, which tends to be safer than the Benoni-style recap- ture with ... cxd4. You will see a true reversed Rffm: OPEN AND CLOSED VARIATIONS 15 Benoni with ... cS in our section on 1 liJf3 dS 2 c4 e6 below, when Black follows a main line and plays ... cS and ... d4. b) Grandmasters have shown some liking for the move 3 ... g6. Then Larsen-Chandler, Hastings 1987/8 provides a good example of the play: 4 i..g2 i..g7 S d3 eS 60-0 liJe7 7 b4! O-O 8liJbd2 (or 8liJa3, with the idea liJc2 and either queenside expansion or a central break by e3; this leads to original positions) 8 ... aS 9 bS cS! (Black shouldn't cede too much ground) 10 bxc6liJexc6! (the idea is that the knight on e7 has few prospects, whereas the knight on b8 can watch over cS from a6 or d7) 11 i..a3 (D) (11 l:!.b1 is the obvious alternative; Black has satisfactory play in this kind of position be- cause of his ability to put knights on b4 and/or cS as needed).
B
ll...liJb4 (or 11...l:!.e8, introducing the idea of ... i..f8; then White might try to target squares like d6 and b6 by 12 cS, having in mind liJe4 and 'Yi'b3) 12 Wib3 liJ8a6 (a good alternative is 12 .. :iVe7 with the idea ... liJ8a6 or ... liJ8c6) 13 i..xb4 axb4?! (13 ... liJxb4 is better) 14 a3! bxa3 IS "iVxa3l:!.e8 16l:!.fb1 and White had a pleasant advantage, very much in the style of a Benko Gambit, and not even a pawn down! 4 i..g2 e5 (D) 50-0 In the reversed position (picture Black's knight already developed on f6), d3 is usually met by ... i..b4+, to force a piece to d2. That strat- egy is also a sensible one here; for example, S d3 i..b4+ 6 i..d2 (the idea is that after 6liJbd2 i..d6, White can no longer play liJa3-c2, but 6 liJfd2 would certainly be possible, retaining the w option of liJa3-c2) 6 ... aS; Black might play ... liJf6-d7-cS later. Naturally, there are trade- offs. For one thing, White is developing rapidly and getting castled ahead of time. It's an open question whether he can break with e3 or b4, and what advantage that might bring. 5 •.• liJf6 There's an interesting parallel here with the Schmid Benoni line 1 d4liJf6 2liJf3 cS 3 dS g6 4liJc3 i..g7 S e4 (a position also important to the Sicilian Hyper-Accelerated Dragon: 1 e4 cS 2liJf3 g6 3 d4 i..g7 4 dSliJf6 SliJc3) S ...

If you've played that line with either colour, you might well think that S. .. e4 6liJe 1 (D) would favour White in our game because of the vulnerability and likely decimation of Black's centre.

This position is said to be clearly better for White, and it certainly looks promising with the cooperation of a queenside advance and the bishop on g2. However, Black's centralized pieces provide a counterweight. Here are some options: a1) 1O ... iLxd3? 11 exd3 iLxb4 12 iLxf6! gxf6 (after 12 ... ~xf6? 13 ~b3!

Let's return to S ... liJf6:
6 d3 (D)
6 ... i.e7 Generally, this move has been criticized be- cause of White's response. There are other moves, such as 6 ... i.d6, but the most important is 6 ... aS, when 7liJa3 is sometimes played with the idea of liJc2, l:.bl, a3 and M. Such positions are fascinating from a strategic point of view, and may appeal to those who want to play chess without immediate confrontations. However, the main line is 7 e3, attacking the centre. Then Black can try: a) 7 ... i.e7 8 exd4 exd4 9liJa3 (D). al) Now 9 ... i.xa3 10 bxa3 is a kind of trade that we've seen in several openings, sometimes when White captures a knight on a6. In con- junction with a fianchettoed bishop on g2, a rook on the b-file will generally more than compensate for the doubled a-pawns, which tend not to be a weakness until the endgame in any case. When White also gains the bishop- pair without giving Black's knights a major

The Open Reti w Danailov - Bernard Warsaw 1990 1liJf3 d5 2 c4 dxc4 (D) Capturing on c4 opens the position, hence the name 'Open Reti', also called the 'Reti Ac- cepted'. By this means Black resolves the prob- lem of having to defend a structure with ... e6 and ... dS, or ... c6 and ... dS, which he may feel is a cramped one. His d-file is open, and there's a good chance of establishing a healthy restraint of White's d-pawn via ... cS or ... eS. 3liJa3 For White, 3 liJa3 is arguably the course tru- est to the spirit of the opening, since fianchettoes will follow. This development of the knight to the rim is also seen in the Catalan Opening and a couple of other Reti variations, with similar trade-offs. Of course, this is not the only way to recover the pawn; let's look briefly at alterna- tives: a) 3 e3 will usually transpose to a Queen's Gambit Accepted after 3 ... liJf6 4 .lixc4 cS S d4.

The Closed Reti ItDf3 d5 2 c4 e6 (D) w This is the Closed Reti Opening, the most consistently played variation of the Reti over the first few decades of its development, and

still very popular. This is due in part to the fact that English Opening players, when faced with
1 c4 e6, frequently want to avoid a transposi-
tion into the Queen's Gambit Declined by 2 d4 d5 or 2 ltJc3 d5 3 d4. Thus, after 1 c4 e6, they play 2 ltJf3 d5 and go into a Reti Opening via 3 g3 or 3 b3. Still another possible move-order is 1 c4ltJf62ltJf3 e63 g3 (or 3 b3) 3 ... d5. Not sur- prisingly, the Closed Reti is characterized by slow manoeuvring. Both sides tend to develop their pieces conventionally, with White fian- chettoing both his bishops and Black playing ... ltJf6, ... i.e7, ... O-O, ... b6 and ... i.b7 and usu- ally setting up a moderate-sized centre with ... c5. You will see that, barring the exchange cxd5, both sides' rooks can stay uninvolved in the fray for a long time, and their optimal place- ment is difficult to determine until the early middle game or later. 3b3 The main line that we're heading for can be reached if White begins with either fianchetto; for example, 3 g3 ltJf6 4 i.g2 i.e7 5 O-O O-O 6 b3 c5, etc. Black has unique options, however, after 3 g3 ltJf6 (or immediately 3 ... dxc4) 4 i.g2 dxc4 (D) (4 ... i.e7 5 b3 transposes to the main Reti lines). w I can't do justice to the large and disparate body of theory and practice here, but both sides should look out for these possibilities: a) 5 'it'c2 (the similar 5 'it'a4+ is less flexible because after 5 ... ltJbd7 6 'i!kxc4 {or 6 ltJa3} 6 ... c5, the queen will have to move again; the- ory indicates an equal outcome) 5 ... ltJbd7 (not the only move, of course) 6 ltJa3 c5 (6 ... i.xa3 7 bxa3 ltJb6 8 ltJe5 O-O 9 i.b2 may give White a small edge because of his bishop-pair) 7 O-O (or 7 ltJxc4 b5 8 ltJce5 ltJd5 9 ltJxd7 i.xd7 10 b3 i.e7 11 i.b2 O-O 12 O-O, Polugaevsky-Serper, Tilburg 1992, and now 12 ... f6 followed by ..

Strategically, Black either plays for a queenside attack via ... as-a4 and ... ltJd7-cS, or, if White plays d4, he will ideally get in the free- ing move ... cS. For his part, White will try to use his greater mobility and the slight weaknesses in Black's camp. The classic example is Botvinnik-Bis- guier, Hastings 1961/2: S d3 (since S cxbS or S

Now it looks as though Black has achieved all of his goals and will free his game, but White has pre- pared a trick: 14 b4! (D).
B
Whatever Black does, White will be able to close the position temporarily and then make use of his space advantage: 14 ... cxb4 (14 ... dxc4? is a bad error due to IS dxcS 'iVc7 16 a4! a6 17 axbS axbS 18 :ta7, when along with ideas such as ttJd4, White threatens 19 ':'xb7!

Finally White wins the battle for as and is thus able to penetrate on the queenside. (An ex- ercise: count the number of squares available to each side's pieces.) The game proceeded 2l...ttJg7 22 it.aS 'iVb7 23 .i.xd8 l:lfxd8 24 ttJaS 'iVc7 2S l:.e2 a6 26 ttJe1 ttJfS 27 'iVc3 b4 (if Black does nothing, White will build up and fashion a kingside breakthrough) 28 'iVxb4 l:ldb8 29 'iVc3 l:.bS 30 l:lea2 f6 31 ttJxc6 'iVxc6 32 .i.f1 fxeS 33 it.xbS 'iVxbS 34 dxeS d4 3S 'iVd3 'iVxcs 36 l:.xa6 l:.xa6 37 'iVxa6 'iVxeS 38 ttJd3 'iVf6 39 'iVc8+ ttJf8 40 l:.a8 ttJd6 41 'iVd8 'iVxd8 42 l:lxd8 ttJbS 43 ttJeS ~g7 44 ttJc6 1-0. Very nice.
7.i.b2
Delaying i.b2 with 7 e3 has good and bad points; the idea is that in Benoni-like positions with ... d4, White's bishop is often better-placed on c1 than b2. For one thing the bishop on b2 blocks White's support of a b4 advance by a rook on b1; furthermore, a bishop on c1 might find an influential post on f4 or even support the move f4 if Black plays ... eS. After 7 e3 ttJc6 8 iile2, Kourkounakis-Botsari, Aegina 1995 pro- ceeded 8 ... d4 ?! 9 exd4 cxd4 10 ttJeS !? ttJxeS 11 iilxeS ttJd7! 12 ~e2. Now Black should proba- bly play 12 ... eS 13 d3 l:.e8 14 ttJd2 ttJcS, con- ceding White just a small edge after IS ttJe4 due to his mobile queenside majority and a powerful bishop on g2. Unfortunately for White, the absence of a bishop on b2 allows Black to contest eS by 8 ... dxc4 9 bxc4 eS!, with the idea 10 ~b2 ~fS!, If that's satisfactory for Black, then the text-move is preferable. Thus we return to 7 i.b2 (D):
B
This is the traditional main line of the Closed Reti, and arguably of the Reti Opening as a whole. Black now decides where to put his queen's knight, what to do with his bishop, and whether to play for ... d4. Let's see some games.
RETI: OPEN AND CLOSED VARIATIONS 27

O-O 6 O-O c5 7 iLb2 ttJc6 I haven't used the exact move-order of the game because I want to mention a frequently- used move-order, 7 ... b6 8 e3 iLb7. This will transpose to one of our main lines if Black plays 9 ... ttJc6 or 9 ... ttJbd7 (after 9 'iVe2, for example); see the following game. In this case, however, Black can't play the ... d4 variation that he does here.
8 e3 (D)
Over the years, White has settled upon this move as the main line. 8 cxd5 comes too early to cause Black real problems: 8 ... exd5 (or S. .. ttJxd5 9 ttJc3, when 9 ... iLf6 10 'iVc1 ttJxc3 11 iLxc3 e5 was Reti-Griinfeld, Teplitz-Schonau 1928, while 9 ... b6 with the idea ... iLa6 is also fine) 9 d4 ':'eS 10 ttJc3 iLg4 11 dxc5 iLxc5. Here Black has the kind of active play he doesn't get in the main lines, when his bishop is on b7 in- stead of g4.

8. .. d4
In the next game we'll see the safer 8 ... b6. Other moves are seen much less often, although several are playable. Generally, if left to his own resources White can play 'iVe2 and an early d4 (often after cxd5), or in some cases d3 and e4, with some pull. It's worth mentioning that S. .. dxc4 9 bxc4 'iVd3 can be met by 10 'iVb3 with a superior position should Black exchange queens. 9 exd4 cxd4 (D) w Initially only a small minority of players were willing to test this position as Black, since it looked too much like a Modem Benoni with colours reversed in which Black wouldn't be able to play ... e5 successfully. 10 ':'el ttJe8! This retreat became the main line after some bad experiences with slower moves. Tal-Zhur- avliov, USSR Ch, Kharkov 1967 continued 1O ... lIeS 11 a3 a5 (12 b4 must be prevented) 12 d3 iLfS (12 ... 'iVb6!?) 13 ttJe5! ttJxe5 14 ':'xe5 ttJd7 (D). w 15l:tb5! (threateningiLxd4) 15 ... e516ttJd2!. These are standard Benoni ideas. White's pres- sure on the queenside and superior develop- ment (all but one of Black's pieces are on the first rank) guarantee him the advantage. Notice that in this line White doesn't solve Black's problems for him by 16 iLxb7?! iLxb7 17 ':'xb7 ttJc5 IS :b5 :b8!.
28 MASTERING THE CHESS OPENINGS
By contrast, 1O ... tiJe8 prepares to support d4 by ... f6 and ... eS while covering vulnerable squares inside Black's camp. 11 d3 White can play more ambitiously by 11 tiJeS tiJxeS 121:.xeS f6 131:.el eS (or 13 ... tiJc7 14 f4 nb8 with the idea ... bS, which is hard to assess) 14 f4!

2004. White has sacrificed a pawn for excellent
piece pressure. 18 ... SLd6!? looks best, when Kosten suggests 19 SLxd4 tiJc7 20 SLf3 SLxg3
21 SLf2!. Then if 21 ... SLxf2+ 22 ~xf2, White's
central pawns, combined with the e-file and temporary pressure on b7, are at least the equiv- alent of Black's three passed pawns. Similarly,
21.. .SLf4 22 d4 gives White good chances, es-
pecially in view of 22 ... tiJe6 23 SLxb7! SLxb7 241:.xe6. Overall, this line looks like a promis- ing way for White to go. 11 ... f612 tiJa3 (D)
B
12• •• e5 13 tiJc2 Although ... tiJbd7 is common in the Modem Benoni, here we see White playing the alternate Benoni plan tiJa3-c2 in almost every line, be- cause b4 (or at least the threat of b4) is neces- sary in order to keep Black on the defensive and counteract his space advantage.
13. .. tiJc7 14 'i'd2
White supports the move b4 and clears his back rank. This does use up the d2-square for a knight redeployment, but tiJd2 isn't necessarily a good idea anyway. Instead, 14 tiJh4! ? (D) is a strange-looking but promising move that tries to provoke Black into weakening his kingside with ... gS, and then attacking it with h4.
B
This is an idea that appears in the King's In- dian Defence as well as the Modem Main Line of the Benoni. Since f4 is a positional threat, Black 'cooperates': 14 ... gS IS tiJG. Now White is ready to play h4; apparently, he needn't be in a hurry to make progress in such positions since he faces few threats. Here are two examples: a) IS ... SLe6?! 16 tiJfxd4 (this seems a good spot for 16 h4! g4 17 tiJh2 'i'd7 18 'iVd2 as 19 'iVh6) 16 ... exd4 (16 ... tiJxd4 17 SLxd4 exd4 18 :xe6 tiJxe6 19 SLdS 'iVb6! 20 'iVe2 ~h8 21 'iVxe6!

SLfS seems more accurate: 16 'i'e2 SLg4 (16 ... 1:.f7! covers the second rank to quash any tactics; then 17 h4 g4 18 tiJd2 is hard to as- sess) 17 h3 SLhS?! (17 ... SLe6) 18 g4 SLg6 19 tiJfxd4! tiJxd4. Now the safest move is 20 SLxd4 !le8! 21 SLb2 SLxd3 22 'iVd2; then Black has his share of the centre, but White has the threat of SLxb7 and moves like tiJe3 and 1:.adl in store. In- stead, Kosarev-Bets, Peterhof 2006 continued 20 tiJxd4!? SLb4 21 tiJfS SLxel 221:.xel SLxfS?! (22 ... 1:.b8 23 SLe4) 23 gxfS l::.b8, when White should have opened lines for his rook by 24 h4! gxh4 2S f4! exf4 26 'iVg4+ Rh8 27 'i'xf4 with two bishops, an attack and d4-dS-d6 in reserve. Sometimes White plays 14 a3 as, when IS 'iVd2 transposes to the game, while IS1:.bl has also led to many tough battles.

w This kind of pawn-structure, common to this variation and the Modem Benoni, would be fine for White if he didn't have his dark-squared bishop, because he could challenge for the a- file.

rook on f1 to support a kingside pawn-storm. In fact, much of the time that White succeeds di- rectly out of the opening, he does so with some version of f4-fS or g4-gS and transferring his pieces towards the black king. Conversely, having played ... dxc4, Black doesn't have to worry about cxdS diverting his pieces and can get to work in the centre and queenside. It's generally important to exchange off White's light-squared bishop, which other- wise might participate in a central or kingside attack. Generally, ... a6 and ... bS are key moves for Black's counterplay, opening lines on the queenside or driving White's pieces away. 11,..l::tc8 The most common move is 11...~c7.

2 Reti: Slav Variations
Ilbf3 d5 2 c4 c6 (D) w A broad complex of positions can arise from ... c6/ ... d5 structures in the Reti Opening. Right away, I should put them in context. In playing
2. .. c6, Black indicates that he is happy to con-
test a Slav Defence, which White can immedi- ately enter into by 3 d4. The most common alternatives to that move are 3 g3 and 3 b3. White sometimes plays a combination of e3, ~c2, lbc3, b3 and Si.b2, but the 'purest' Reti set-up is the one followed by Reti himself: a double fianchetto. How White can achieve that and whether Black permits him to are the first questions both sides must consider, because there are so many early changes of direction that might spoil their respective plans. The question of how to react to a Slav move- order also arises in the English Opening, and it's worth a digression to talk about how White should respond after 1 c4 c6. Again, he can play
2 d4 d5 with a Slav Defence. Or he can choose 2
lbf3 d5, transposing to this chapter. I should mention a third option, 2 e4 (equivalent to the Caro-Kann line 1 e4 c6 2 c4), when after 2 ... d5 3 exdS cxd5, 4 d4 is a Caro-Kann Panov Attack. He can also play 4 cxd5, which can reach typical isolated queen's pawn positions after 4 ... lbf6 and 5 ... lbxd5, though White has independent options such as 5 ~a4+!? and 5 Si.b5+. If Black wants to avoid all this, he can also try 1 c4 c6 2 e4 e5, but that has its own set of prob- lems after 3 lbf3, and is quite rare. The inter- ested reader will have to dig around in books and databases. Sticking with the 1 c4 c6 English Opening for a moment, Tony Kosten points out that the move-order 2 g3 d5 3 Si.g2 (D) has some posi- tive features.
B
First, this move frustrates Black's desire to play ... Si.g4 without committing his knights: 3 ... Si.g4? 4 cxd5 cxd5 5 "i/Vb3 attacks d5 and b7, and 5 ... "i/Vc8 (threatening the bishop on cl) only staves off material loss for one more move, 6 lbc3, because 6 ... e6?? loses to 7 "i/Va4+! and 8 ~xg4 (keep your eye out for this trick, which occurs in several openings). Therefore, after 1 c4 c6 2 g3 d5 3 Si.g2, Black might want to try 3 ... lbf6 4lbf3 Si.g4, but this transposes into a version of the Reti main line below (llbf3 d5 2 c4 c6 3 g3lbf6 4 Si.g2 Si.g4) in which White can play the effective move 5 lbe5. Contrast this with the sequence Ilbf3 d5
2 c4 c6 3 g3 Si.g4 4 Si.g2, when Black can
choose 4 ... lbd7, preventing lbe5. So by playing 1 c4 and 2 g3, White has reached a Reti System and bypassed the popu- lar set-up with both ... Si.g4 and ... lbd7. Of course, there are always trade-offs. After 1 c4

c6 2 g3 d5 3 ii.g2, White must be willing to touch upon a subset of these, let's look at a few play against 3 ... dxc4 (D). games. w Then Kosten suggests recovering the pawn by 4liJa3 ii.e6 (not 4 ... b5? in view of 5 liJxb5, but 4 ... e5 5liJxc4 f6 is definitely worthy of con- sideration) 5 'iVc2 liJa6 6 liJxc4liJb4!? 7 'iVb3 ii.d5! 8 ii.xd5 'iVxd5 9liJf3. Following 9 ... e5 10 a3 b5 11 axb4 bxc4, he recommends 12 ~e3!, attacking e5 and a7 while in some cases playing an effective :ta5. So far, so good, but a possible problem is that Black can play 9 ... e6 instead, which sets up a nice restraint pawn-structure that goes well with the good bishop on f8. 9 ... e6 also works tactically in the line 10 a3 b5 11 axb4 bxc4 12 'iVc3liJf6 with the idea 13 J:.a5 c5. This last position is hard to assess, but at any it's not a clear improvement for White over the lines beginning with 2liJf3. Instead of Kosten's 4liJa3, McDonald likes 4liJf3, giving the gambit line 4 ... b5 5 a4 ii.b7 6 b3! cxb3 7 'iVxb3 (actually, 7 axb5 cxb5 8 'iVxb3 seems to favour White slightly as well) 7 ... a6 8 ii.a3 with strong play. One issue in that case is whether other fourth moves like 4 .. . ii.e6 and 4 ... liJf6 are better. For example, after 4 ... liJf6, we've transposed to 3 g3 liJf64 ii.g2 dxc4 be- low. I have gone somewhat far afield to describe these ramifications of 1 c4 c6 2 g3, but they could be of considerable interest to English Opening players as well as those who prefer the Reti Opening. Let's return to lliJf3 d5 2 c4 c6. The mate- rial expands quickly, as White has multiple moves at every juncture and Black several re- plies to each. With the warning that I shall only The System with ... i..g4 Miroshnichenko - Mammadov Baku 2006 lliJf3 d5 2 c4 c6 3 g3 (D) We are used to weighing the differences be- tween 3 g3 and 3 b3 when White is planning to fianchetto both bishops. But his intention in this game is to forego b3 with other ideas in mind. A drawback to doing so is that he allows ... dxc4 without being able to recapture with the b-pawn, but a significant benefit is that his queen is free to come to b3 or a4, something that happens consistently in the variations of this game and the next. White will also delay liJc3 for some time so as to steer clear of attack by ... d4, as well as to reserve to right to play liJbd2 or liJa3.

3 ••• liJf6 Black doesn't commit his queen's bishop, which can go to f5 or g4.

The ideas are similar to ones below. 4 ii.g2 The basic position. We'll look at acceptance of the gambit by ... dxc4 on this or the next move in the game Poldauf-Saltaev below (,The Gam- bit Accepted'). 4 ••• ii.g4 (D)
36 MASTERING THE CHESS OPENINGS
w As you can quickly work out, this basic and popular position can arise via other move- orders. Having played ... i..g4, Black is free to follow up by ... e6 without shutting in his bishop, something he is forced to do in many 1...dS openings. While he has several ways to proceed, Black's most common and in many ways ideal set-up is ... liJbd7, ... e6, ... i..d6 and ... O-O, with ... eS to follow at some point. Occasionally, he is more ambitious and plays ... liJbd7, ... i..xf3 and ... eS straightaway, which saves a tempo, but is riskier because it cedes the bishop-pair and leaves his d-pawn only loosely defended. The move ... i..xf3 fits in well with this general idea of central expansion, particularly if White uses the extra tempo h3 to encourage it. That said, h3 can also be answered by ... i..hS. You can see why many players like the flexibility and im- balance that the ... c6/. .. dS systems can provide. White has his own opportunities, of course. A significant drawback to 4 ... i..g4 is that it takes a defender away from Black's queenside. White will very often try to exploit its absence by playing ~b3, hitting the dS- and b7-pawns, or ~a4, tying up Black's pieces on that side of the board. Another issue is that White can play liJeS, attacking Black's bishop on g4. Note that liJeS, c4, liJc3 and i..g2 all either directly or indi- rectly attack Black's central and queenside light squares, which means that Black can easily lose material if he isn't careful. What's more, a fur- ther pawn-break by e4 can cause additional damage. SliJeS This leap of the knight disturbs the balance by attacking the bishop on g4; White also steers clear of ... i..xf3. Obviously, this needs to be done before S ... liJbd7 is played. On the other hand, Black allows this move for a reason: the knight on eS isn't defended and can be swapped off by ... liJbd7 with a gain of time. A little sim- plification won't hurt Black, who temporarily controls more space. Of course, White can still go into the double fianchetto lines by S b3 (which has its own sec- tion below; see, for example, the game Pod- zielny-Dautov), but other slow moves have generally been unimpressive because they don't do enough about Black's basic plan. For one thing, Black threatens S ... i..xf3 6 i..xf3 dxc4, winning a pawn that is not easy to recover. If White plays S cxdS, Black often responds with S ... i..xf3 6 i..xf3 cxdS, on the grounds that he now has the ideal square for his knight on c6; here S ... cxdS 6liJc3liJc6 is another respectable option. So we can see the reasoning behind S liJeS, which is the critical move. Thus we return to SliJeS (D):
B
S••• i..hS?! Since White intends to play liJxg4 followed by e4, Black removes his bishop from capture. a) The retreat by S ... i..fS occurs less often, but it's a legitimate continuation. Then 6 cxdS cxdS 7liJc3 (7 ~a4+!?) can be met by 7 ... liJc6 with the idea 8 liJxc6 bxc6 9 ~a4 i..d7, or 9 .. :ii'd7. Otherwise, 7 ... e6 8 ~a4+ liJbd7 9 g4 i..g6 transposes to a position from this game. b) The most important alternative is S ... i..e6 (D), which may well be the best defence. Black threatens ... dxc4, in some cases fol- lowed by ... i..dS or ... ~d4. As one might expect, White has many ways to react. Unfortunately, they aren't related thematically, so if you are

w interested in this line for either colour you'll want to do some work. Here are a few ideas: bl) 6 'iVb3 'iVc7 is easy for Black because White is so far from getting his pieces out that he can't exploit the queen's placement along the c-file.

At this point things can get surprisingly tactical: a) 8 ... eS?! is slightly premature because of another typical idea from the Semi-Slav: 9 cxd5 and after 9 ... cxdS 10 lbbS .i.b8 11 llc1 White

has the dual ideas of iLa3 and liJc7. Instead, 9 ... liJxdS 10 liJe4 i.c7 allows White to play the fun and dangerous attack 11 liJegS g6 12 h4!. b) 8 ... dxc4 9 bxc4 eS and now 10 O-O favours White slightly because of his centre pawns, but the sacrifice 10 g4!? is more fun: 1O ... liJxg4!? (lO ... liJcs 11 gS liJfd7 12 h4 is double-edged) 11liJe4 i.c7 12l:tgl fS 13liJegS, and instead of 13 ... 'iVe7? 14 ':'xg4, as in Cornette-Arutinian, Iraklion 2002, 13 ... liJdf6 14 cS e4 IS h3 exf3 16 i.c4+ liJdS 17 l:txg4 leads to great complica- tions. c) 8 ... 'iVe7 9 g4!? (this is a popular pawn sacrifice in similar positions; White's first idea is gS, driving the knight from the centre, fol- lowed by O-O-O and a kingside pawn-storm) 9 ... liJxg4 10 l:tglliJgeS llliJxeSliJxeS (Wojta- szek-Cichocki, Dzwirzyno 2004) and here Kos- ten suggests 12 O-O-O!, giving the sample line 12 ... dxc4 13 f4! cxb3 14 'iVxb3 liJg6 IS liJe4 with a powerful attack; for example, IS ... i.b4

Obviously, White won't always get such dy- namic play from the slow build-up with e3, 'iVc2, b3 and liJc3, but in any case the game is unbalanced and both sides should know some- thing about it. d) 8 ... a6 9 ':'gl!? bS 10 g4 b4 (after lO ... bxc4, Gurevich suggests 11 gS! cxb3 12 axb3 liJe8 13 i.d3 with threats) 11 gS! liJe8 12liJa4 'VJIJe7 13 h4, M.Gurevich-Kallai, Bundesliga 200112. White has a dangerous attack, but the position is obscure. 3 ••• liJf64 i.g2 i.f5 (D) w Black develops his bishop before cutting it off by ... e6. As always, the players can arrive at this basic position via different move-orders, and this game in fact began 1 liJf3 liJf6 2 g3 dS 3 i.g2 i.fS 4 c4 c6. By putting the bishop on the active square fS, Black avoids getting hit by liJeS, as in the last game, but also loses the op- tion of ... i.xf3, which makes a successful ... eS less likely. Since Black's queenside is defended by one less piece, White will bring his queen to b3 and try to combine pressure on dS with that on b7. 5 cxd5 This is the most popular choice, although there are two major alternatives. One is to play into a traditional Reti set-up by S b3 e6 6 O-O liJbd7 7 i.b2; compare the double fianchetto game below. The other is S O-O, when S. .. dxc4 is a respectable move that transposes to 4 ... dxc4 S O-O i.fS. Instead, if Black plays S ... e6, 6 d3 has a bit more to it than may first appear: 6 ... i.e7 (the structure after 6 ... dxc4 7 dxc4 'ili'xdl 8 ':'xdl liJbd7 9 liJc3 favours White slightly; he wants to gain the bishop-pair by liJh4, and 9 ... i.b4 lO i.d2 renews that idea, intending to answer 1O ... h6?! with 11 liJbS! cxbS 12 i.xb4 as 13 i.d6, after which the bishops rule) 7 i.e3!? (D).
B
Quite a few games have arrived at this posi- tion. White is playing one of Black's favourite set-ups with colours reversed (that is, in the London System with 2 liJf3 and 3 iLf4 versus the King's Indian Defence). White's idea is that after 'ili'b3, Black won't be able to reply with ... 'iVb6, and if Black's queen moves to the c-file, a speedy cxdS, liJc3 and l:tel will create strong pressure down that file. With care, Black should be able to keep his disadvantage to a minimum, but the game stays

One possible reply is 6 O-O e6 7 d4 with a supe- rior central position. Then Black cannot pre- vent e4 forever; for example, 7 ... iLe7 (7 ... ttJd7 8 ttJbd2!? ttJ7f6 9 ttJe5 iLb4? 10 e4! iLxd2 11 exd5 iLxc1 12 dxc6!, etc.) 8 ttJe5 iLg6 9 e4 ttJb6 (9 ... ttJf6 10 ttJc3) 10 ttJc3 O-O 11 h4!, and h5 can only be stopped by a compromising se- quence such as ll...iLf6 12 ttJxg6 hxg6 13 e5 iLe7 14 h5! gxh5 15 "fixh5, with White threat- ening iLe4, 'iti>g2, .l:.hl, and also simply ttJe4. Returning to the game (after 5 cxd5 cxd5), we see that the position has a similar structure to the Exchange Slav. However, the placement of White's bishop on g2 in the Reti gives the po- sition a different character. Although White has taken an extra tempo to develop it, the bishop won't normally be exchanged, as it is after iLb5 or iLd3 in the Slav. This means that it can sup- port the advance e4. 6 "fIIb3 (D) This attack on b7 is played in the great ma- jority of games.

6 ...1li'c8 Since 6 ... b6 would badly weaken the light squares, Black needs to defend b7 with his queen. There are two other logical ways to do so: a) 6 .. :iVd7!? 7 ttJe5 isn't as bad as it looks; for example, 7 ... 1li'c7 8 ttJc3 (White defends c 1, and can answer 8 ... 1li'xe5? by 91li'xb7; thus he gains a lead in development) 8 ... e6 9 d3 (White prevents Black from putting a piece on e4; it ap- pears that he could go for broke by 9 g4!?, meeting 9 ... iLg6 with 10 h4!, when perhaps 10 ... h6 11 ttJxg6 fxg6 is workable; note that Black must avoid 9 ... ttJxg4?? 10 ttJxg4 iLxg4 11 "fia4+) 9 ... ttJc6 10 ttJxc6 bxc6 11 O-O (Dzhin- dzhikhashvili-Bagirov, Tbilisi 1973) and now Black would experience no real problems after ll...iLd6 or Il..Jlb8 121li'a4 iLd6. b) 6 .. :iib6 may be best: 71li'xb6 (7 ttJc3 is also played) 7 ... axb6 8 ttJc3 ttJc6 (8 ... e6 9 ttJb5!? is supposed to favour White, although after 9 ... l:.a5, that's hard to demonstrate) 9 d3 e6 10 ttJb5 .i.b4+ 11 iLd2 'iti>e7 12 ttJfd4 iLxd2+ 13 'iti>xd2 iLg6 14 f4!.

In Vilela-Alarcon, Ha- vana 2007, White responded with the direct 12 liJb5 (after 12 a3 a6, the standard idea 13 e4! gives White the upper hand, especially after 13 ... liJc5 14 'l'c2 iL.g6 15 b4) 12 ... liJc5 13 'l'dl 'l'd7 14 liJbd4 liJxd4 15 liJxd4 iL.g6 16 b4 liJa6 17 a3, and the a6-knight is restricted by White's queenside pawns, so he has something to play for. 12 liJe5!? The pawn sacrifice 12 e4 also leads to the better game. Black should accept the pawn, al- though it comes at the cost of exposing his pieces and ceding the bishop-pair: 12 ... dxe4 (12 ... iL.g6 13 exd5 exd5 14 d4 favours White) 13 dxe4 liJxe4 14 liJxe4 iL.xe4 15 liJe5 liJxe5 16 iL.xe4 liJc6 17 .l:.fdl 'l'c8 18 'i'a4.l:.d8 1911xd8+ 'l'xd8 20 iL.xc6 bxc6 21 'iWxc6 with an edge for White, Barcza-Smyslov, Moscow Olympiad 1956. 12• •. liJxe513 iL.xe5 iL.g614 e4 (D) A much later game, Pigusov-Lin Weiguo, Beijing 1996, saw the seemingly slow 14 h3, to prevent ... liJg4.

A prophylactic move such as 14 h3 is possible since Black has no way to create threats or change the pawn-structure in one move.

This main line is very important if we are going to assess the Reti Slav as a whole. White is a pawn down, and if he can't recover it or has to make concessions in doing so, this whole move-order becomes suspect. As we shall see in the next game, it's also not easy to bypass this position via earlier deviations. 5~c2 Over the years, this move has probably had the most success and is recommended in two English Opening repertoire books. Not only does White target the pawn on c4, but he stops ... i.fS and stays flexible in terms of playing ttJa3, O-O and/or a4. However, White has run into quite a few difficulties, so finding an alternative could be important. Fortunately, there are at least three candidates. They have a good deal of theory behind them, so I'll try to indicate the outlines and trust you to look into the material more deeply: a) S O-O (D) is fascinating, because White gives Black extra time to consolidate his pawn. The consequences are still unresolved.

At any rate, White has to develop quickly; for example, 5 ttJc3 (5 ~b2!?) 5 ... ttJd7 (D), and now: w a) 6 d3 ttJgf6 7 ~b2 ~d6 8 g3 gives Black easy play after 8 ... ttJc5 9 ~g2 O-O 10 O-O ~f5. b) 6 e3 is sound, although d4 is hard to enforce without concessions; e.g., 6 ... ttJgf6 (D) (the alternative 6 ... ~b4 7 'it'c2 'it'e7 8 ~b2 ttJh6!? 9 ~e2 ttJf6 10 O-O ~f5 would be an in- teresting sequence, with an eye on d3, but also to a kingside attack via ... e4). w 7 d4!?

That's a lot of analysis, but taken as a whole, 3 ... dxc4 4 bxc4 e5! presents White with prob- lems to solve, enough to call into question his ability to gain an advantage. Remarkably, this little two-step manoeuvre hasn't been given se- rious consideration in the extensive literature on 3 b3. What's more, the same idea a move later might be even more challenging in this re- spect, since White's options are more limited. 4i.b2 The most frequently played move by a con- siderable margin is 4 g3, because White likes to stay flexible about the placement of his queen's bishop, but then he again has to deal with 4 ... dxc45 bxc4 e5!

5 g3 I should mention that some strong players use 5 e3 and try to set up with .Be2, 'fic2 and W lbc3. This was discussed in the note to 3 g3 in the game Smyslov-Bronstein above.

7 ... .Bd6 7 ... .Be7 is less ambitious, deferring ... e5 for a while. In some cases this protects Black from loss of tempo when the d-file opens (after, say, d3, e4, and ... dxe4), or when White brings a knight to c4 or e4. Play usually continues 8 d3 O-O 9 lbbd2. Now there are several accepted defences, including 9 ... a5 10 a3 'fib6. The modem favourite (inspired by some very old games) is 9 ... 'fib8! (D), with the ideas of ... e5 and ... b5, while the queen avoids potential exposure down the c-file that would follow ... 'fic7 and lIcl.

(sometimes White plays this manoeuvre when Black's bishop is still on g4, so that lbe3 comes with tempo; lba3-c2-e3 is another path, but here it appears rather point- less) 12 ... l:te8 13 g4 .Bg6 14lbh4 a4 15 lbxg6 hxg6 16 'iVc2 b5 with a space advantage for Black. b) The classic R6ti manoeuvre 10 1Ic1 l:te8 11 l:tc2 .Bd6 12 'iVaI appeared in Andersson- Garcia Martinez, Madrid 1973, which contin- ued 12 ... e5 13 cxd5 cxdS 14 e4?! and after 14 ... d4 ISl:tfc1 .Bf8 16 h3 .Bxf3 17lbxf3 as 18 h4?! a4 Black was fine, although 14 ... dxe4 or 14 ... bS were probably better ways to play for an edge.

As opposed to lbbd2, the knight will cover a3, deterring the exchange of bishops by ... .Ba3; also, in a few cases the move lbe3 can be useful.

In a majority of games involving the double fianchetto and ... J..g4, White plays e4 at some moment and this pawn-structure results. The combination of e4 and c4 has a mixed effect. From White's point of view, the gaping hole on d4 is clearly a negative, although in practice it proves difficult for Black to occupy. Further- more, his king's bishop is restricted by his own centre pawn on e4. On the positive side, that same pawn supports a knight on f5, which will be very powerfully placed. Black's problem is that if he exchanges the knight by ... J..xf5 (often necessary), then exf5 reopens the g2- bishop's diagonal and White's e-file, while clearing what is effectively an outpost square for White's pieces on e4. In fact, that's what happened in the game after 14 ... :fd8?! (Vagan- ian prefers 14 ...

3 Modern Kingside Fianchetto
The fianchetto is used in three general types of central environment. Thus far in this series, we have seen it in a variety of well-established openings of two of these types. In the first case, a central presence is employed in conjunction with a fianchetto. For instance, in the Griinfeld Defence Black plays 1 d4 liJf6 2 c4 g6 along with a central break C3 ... dS), whereas in the Modem Benoni, Black's ... g6 is joined with ... cS. In the English and Reti Openings, White's g3 fianchetto combines with a pawn on c4, whereas in most major d-pawn openings, White can merge the same g3 with the central move d4. In a second set of mainstream openings, there is no central pawn presence, that is, no early break or pawn on the fourth rank. Some examples are the King's Indian Defence and Pirc Defence, in which Black plays ... d6. It's true that he often follows this with a central ad- vance by ... eS or ... cS, but not within the first few moves. This also applies to the Queen's In- dian Defence with ... b6, where the moves ... dS and ... c5 are usually delayed. However, notice that in most lines of these openings, Black de- velops quickly; in particular, his king's knight is developed to f6, controlling e4 and dS and making kingside castling more convenient. This adds an element of safety and contests the cen- tre of the board. In a third class of fianchetto defences, still looked at askance by some masters, Black fore- goes commitment to either a central break or a strong central presence, often playing without a knight on f6 or c6. The most prominent exam- ples begin with l...g6 and l...b6, which can both be played versus any first move by White and may therefore be considered 'universal' openings. In most variations with these moves, Black allows White to choose from a wide vari- ety of central formations. Thus l...g6 and l...b6 grant Black flexibility, but do the same for White. The defences initiated by l...g6 and l...b6 appeared sporadically in the 19th century and first half of the 20th century, but by and large leading players disapproved of them. After all, why should Black want to give White space and an ideal centre without a fight? The 'Hyper- modems', beginning in the 1910s, proposed that targeting the centre from afar by means of a fianchetto was a legitimate alternative to set- ting up a traditional centre. But even they usu- ally included a pawn on the 4th rank in their plans, or at least quick development. See, for example, the Reti Opening from the previous chapters. Then, in the latter part of the 20th cen- tury, many players discovered that they were comfortable operating with less space, particu- larly if there were opportunities to extend the range of their fianchettoed bishops by eventual pawn-breaks, or to exploit concessions that White might make to prevent that from happen- ing. Thus 1.. .g6 in particular was elevated into the mainstream, and 1...b6, while not wildly popular among high-level players, has attracted the attention of a number of grandmasters. The overriding issue in both cases is whether White can use his greater territorial control to clamp down on Black's game. For the developing player, there is a lot to be learned by playing such positions from both sides and watching these conflicting goals play out. Before plunging into l...g6, I should note that White can himself pursue such a strategy by means of 1 g3 or 1 b3, allowing Black to set up a large centre, when the tempo derived from moving first gives him some extra ways to de- velop. In practice, 1 g3 often transposes to other openings. For example, it can lead to the Reti Opening if White follows with liJf3 and c4, to the King's Indian Attack if White plays liJf3 and d3, or to various d-pawn openings if White plays an early d4. At a grandmaster level, how- ever, White plays 1 g3 infrequently, because Black is able set up conservatively if he wishes, without a big centre, and establish equality relatively easily. 1 b3 can run into the same problem, but it has a more defined history of

independent theory which I'll be examining in the following chapter. The Modern Defence
1 e4 g6 is called variously the Modem Defence,
the King's Fianchetto Defence, the Rat, the Robatsch, and the Utjelky. Perhaps that's a re- flection of its multi-faceted nature; in fact, the move 1...g6 tells us little about the kind of the game that will follow. Both White and Black can deploy their forces in a wide array of for- mations that bear little relation to one another, and the play can go in almost any direction. Thus, in what follows, I'll concentrate upon a selection of the most popular responses to 1. .. g6, with an emphasis on black pawn-structures that haven't been well represented in the rest of this series. From White's point of view, the normal cen- tral set-ups apply, but we'll begin with what is arguably the most important one, involving the centre d4, e4 and f4. This is a direct threat to the playability of 1...g6, more so than the other broad centres that we have examined, for exam- ple, in the King's Indian Defence, the Pirc De- fence, or the Samisch Variation of the Nimzo- Indian. Let's step through some themes that arise from early moves, and then take a look at the problems arising from that central structure.
1 e4 g6 2 d4 i.g7
Obviously 1 d4 g6 2 e4 i.g7 leads to the same position. Curiously, Black has often played 2 ... d6 at this point, because there are lines in which he'd rather get on with a queenside at- tack instead of putting a bishop on g7 yet. Since White plays i.e3, 'iVd2 and i.h6 in many lines, Black may even save a tempo by not playing ... i.g7. That's rather abstract, but he might also be motivated by a specific sequence, that is, 2 ... d63 tLIc3 c6 4 f4 (D), the set-up White uses in the first three games. Then 4 ... i.g7 transposes to the main games, and Black also has these options: a) 4 ... 'iVb6 prevents S i.e3 and puts pressure on the d4-pawn, but Black must be careful in the face of White's attack; for example, S i.c4 i.g7 6 tLIf3 tLIh6 (6 ... i.g4? 7 i.xf7+) 7 i.b3 i.g4 S i.e3 dS, Bologan-Azmaiparashvili, Eu- ropean Clubs Cup, Panormo 2001, and here
B
White can play simply 9 'iWd2! dxe4 10 tLIgS! O-O 11 h3 i.cs 12 g4 and O-O-O with the centre, development and much better placed pieces. b) The most subtle move is 4 ... d5! with the idea S eS hS!?, intending to develop his pieces on kingside light squares, a typical sequence being 6 tLIf3 tLIh67 i.e3 i.g4 S i.e2 tLIfS 9 i.f2 e6 (D). w This is precisely the position arising from the game Hector-Hei below, which begins 1 e4 g6 2 d4 i.g7 3 tLIc3 c6 4 f4 dS S eS hS, etc. In that game, however, Black is a tempo 'ahead', in that he has played ... dS in one jump rather than via ... d6-dS. Ironically, however, Black's extra tempo there is ... i.g7, which is an unde- sirable move! This bishop actually belongs on fS, from where it supports the move ... cS and can go to its best position on e7. Indeed, the move ... i.fS occurs in Hector-Hei. So, by play- ing 2 ... d6 and deferring ... i.g7, Black has man- aged to save two moves ( ... i.g7-fS) in return for his loss of only one tempo ( ... d6-dS). It's
58 MASTERING THE CHESS OPENINGS
silly things like this that make a positional player's life more gratifying! Of course, 2 ... d6 in conjunction with 3 ... c6 is itself committal, and some players may not prefer this pawn- formation if White refrains from (or delays) f4 and plays, say, lbf3 or i.e3 instead. We now return to 2 ... i.g7 (D): w 3lbc3 I'm going to focus on this straightforward knight development, which is basic to the tradi- tional main lines of the Modem Defence, and easily the most popular at every level. It also makes possible a hypermodern interpretation of the opening by Black. For example, the move ... a6 with the idea ... bS is highly relevant in lines with lbc3, and not so much so otherwise. It would be impossible to address the enormous range of possibilities that 1...g6 opens up with- out sacrificing my emphasis upon ideas and themes, but I'll give games with the moves 3 c3 and 3 c4 below. 3 ... d6 Black can also play the subtle and very popu- lar 3 ... c6; see below for illustrative games. If he wants to challenge the centre, the most the- matic move is 3 ... cS, perhaps aiming for a Sicil- ian Defence after 4 lbf3 cxd4 S lbxd4. This is infrequently played as White has two good al- ternatives: a) One is 4 dS, when after 4 ... d6 it is harder for Black to find counterplay than in the Mod- em Benoni (1 d4lbf6 2 c4 cS 3 dS e6 4lbc3 exdS S cxdS d6 6 e4 g6 and ... i.g7), because the knight on c3 is well placed to meet Black's nat- ural pawn-breaks. I won't go into the details, but the most natural continuation is S lbf3 lbf6 (D) (upon S ... eS? or S. .. e6? there follows 6 dxe6 i.xe6 7lbbS; instead, S. .. a6 is logical, but does weaken the b6-square on the queenside, and White can play the standard manoeuvre lbd2-c4; for example, 6 a4 lbf6 7 i.e2 O-O 8 lbd2 e6 9 lbc4 exdS 10 exdS l:te8 11 O-O). w The variation after S. .. lbf6 has transposed to a line of the Schmid Benoni, an opening that can arise from a wide variety of move-orders. A sample line goes 6 i.bS+!? (6 i.e2 is equally common) 6 ... i.d7 (6 ... lbbd7 7 a4 a6 8 i.e2 brings Black's queen's knight to d7, a square from which it can't do much; 6 ... lbfd7 has been played in high-level games, but White has done well, for example in the main line 7 a4 O-O 8 O-O lba6 9 l:tel lbc7 10 i.fl) 7 a4 O-O 8 O-O and White intends to play i.f4 and/or lbd2-c4 with an edge. Hundreds of games have been played with the Schmid Benoni, however, and as you might suspect, both sides have lots of ways to set up their forces. b) 4 dxcS (D) voluntarily breaks up White's centre, with the idea that Black will either lose time recovering his pawn or make concessions. This capture has been played quite a bit and there is plenty to explore. One line is 4 .. :ilVaS S i.d2 'iVxcs, when a challenging move is 6 lbdS!?, threatening 7 i.b4 'iVc6 8 i.bS!. Then there can follow 6 ... lba6 (6 ... b6 is also played, although it's riskier) 7 lbf3 (or 7 i.e3 'iVc6 8 i.d4) 7 ... e6 (7 ... i.xb2?! 8 l:tbl i.g7 9 i.xa6 bxa6 10 O-O ties Black down due to i.b4, when 1O ... aS 11 l:tbS 'iVc6 12 i.xaS works out tacti- cally in White's favour) 8 i.c3 'it>f8 9 i.xg7+ 'it>xg7 10 lbc3 and Black has weaknesses to worry about. Still, this whole line is playable.

4 ... i.xc3+!? S bxc3 'iVaS constitutes another trade-off: attack on White's vulnerable pawns versus dark-square weaknesses around Black's king. White can develop nonnally, but he can also temporarily hold on to his pawn with the ambitious 6 'iVd4lbf6 7 'iVM, when 7 .. :iVxM 8 cxb4 lbxe4 9 i.b2 is an ideal position for White's bishop-pair, so 7 ... 'iVc7! 8lbf3 lbc6 9 'iVa4 might follow. These lines after 4 ... i.xc3+ are particularly interesting and unresolved.
4 f4 (D)
B
Here we have White's most direct challenge to Black's entire system. The intent is to domi- nate the centre and limit Black's pieces. Still, playing with a large centre exposes White to more counterattacking possibilities, so things are by no means clear. One advantage of 4 f4 is that it restricts the opponent's reasonable re- sponses in a way that 4 i.e3 or 4lbf3 doesn't. 4 ••• c6 We shall see 4 ... a6 in the next section, with a note on 4 ... lbc6. Note that 4 ... ttJf6 transposes to a Pirc Defence, and indeed, a Pirc player may wish to use a l...g6 move-order to get to some of his favourite lines. However, when Black plays 1.. .g6, he has to deal with a number of ad- ditional early options by White, whereas I e4 d6 2 d4lbf6 (the Pirc) compels the defence of e4 on the second move and so limits White's choices. Most notably, the Pirc move-order 1 e4 d6 2 d4 ttJf6 3 lbc3 g6 bypasses any lines with c4 for White. After 4 ... c6 Black intends to answer ttJf3 with ... i.g4, when by the further .. :iVb6, he can put pressure upon d4, White's most vulnerable point in the centre. The attack on White's centre by ... i.g7, ... i.g4 and ... 'iVb6 is aggressive and pointed, but it carries the risks that an early queen move typically entails. If Black doesn't want to go this way, he can play for queenside expansion by ... bS, as in the note to S. .. i.g4 be- low. Slbf3 S i.e3 is also played, and worth knowing if you play either side of the popular move-order 4 i.e3 c6, because at that point S f4 transposes. A seeming drawback to S i.e3 is S. . :iVb6, be- cause b2 is attacked and the move ... eS will ex- ploit the pin on d4. But White can still try for advantage after 6 l:.b 1 (protecting b2) 6 ... eS!? (6 ... fS!? was Yudovich-Botvinnik, Moscow Ch 1966; then 7 eS! dxeS 8 fxeS i.xeS 9 i.c4! gives good attacking chances for the pawn, so maybe simply 6 ... ttJf6 should be tried) 7 lbf3

In spite of the tempo consumed by ltbl (which also precludes O-O-O), White's centre and development pose serious problems for Black:

While S. .. bS may be playable, it gives White a lot of space and development to make use of. As always, you should refer to books and data- bases to learn more.

Black's basic idea, to attack White's centre, is shown in the line 6 ..te2 'ilVb6 7 eS 4:Jh6! 8 4:Je4 O-O 9 c3. This is about equal; for example, 9 ... ..tfS !? 10 4:Jf2 cS 11 O-O 4:Jd7. 6 ••• 'i!i'b6 (D) w We have arrived at one of the oldest main lines of the Modern Defence. 7 ~d2 ..txf3 Doubling White's pawns.

The main drawbacks to it are that Black still doesn't rem- edy his backward development and that if the attack doesn't succeed, the move ... bS will make it riskier for him to castle queenside. In- stead, Black could castle more safely right away, but it's not clear where his counterplay is com- ing from after, say, 10 ... O-O-O 11 .l:.g1 ~b8 12
MODERN KINGSIDE FIANCHEITO 61
l:tg5 (or 12 f5) 12 ... ~c7 13 d5, as in 1. Polgar- Crouch, Hastings 1992/3. w After the text-move (l0 ... b5), we have a bat- tle between a centralized position and a flank attack. White has no immediate threats, and Black is counting upon the lack of weaknesses in his pawn-structure (typical of positions with few pawns past the 3rd rank); ideally, his solid position will render White's advances harmless until he can himself make progress. This strat- egy runs up against the Classical school of thought, which says that the modem fianchetto defences (l...g6 and 1...b6) are simply insuffi- cient if White plays in a principled manner by constructing a broad centre, developing quickly and suffocating Black. Experience shows that Black will have many tricky ideas, mostly due to the fact that White's centre is exposed. But the true classicist trusts that these are tempo- rary problems that can be neutralized, after which his pawns and pieces will roll forward. As it happens, the outcome of the particular variation before us (with 4 ... c6 5 lbf3 i..g4) seems to support his point of view. Even if that proves the case, of course, the modernist will point to other variations in which his philoso- phy wins the day. And so it goes. Let's see how the opposing strategies play out in two illustrative games that begin with 1O ... b5. llh4 Bologan - Todor~evic Las Palmas 1993 Trusting in his broad centre and space, White launches a straightforward flank attack. 11 ••• lbb6 Black's idea is to play ... lbc4, either before or after ... b4, or perhaps ... lba4. a) It's still too early for Black to develop by ll...lbgf6?, because of 12 e5 lbd5 (12 ... lbh5 13 d5!) 13 lbxd5 ~xd2 14 i..xd2 cxd5 15 i..xb5. b) Instead, the d7 -knight can also be used to support ... c5, one example going 11...b4 12 lbe2 lbgf6 13 lbg3!?

The bishop on d4 opposes Black's bishop on g7 and thereby interferes with his most promis- ing attacking possibilities on the queenside.

An interesting situation has arisen. At first sight, Black's position seems compact and rel- atively safe from direct attack. However, he finds it hard to develop his pieces or castle, so he has difficulty working up counterplay. This gives White time to get organized. He has vari- ous ways of improving his position such as tiJg3, f5, d5 and e5, and his bishop can go to h3 or c4. In general, the opposite-coloured bishops favour White's attack. In view of all this, Black will have trouble defending. 15••• tiJf6 Black's king is also exposed after 15 ...

This advance is eccentric (literally), but fun and respectable. Before going on to describe it in detail, let me mention two rare alternatives. The slightly more committal4. .. e6!? has been used to get to what is sometimes called the 'Hippo- potamus' set-up, which includes the moves ... b6, ... i.b7, ... g6, ... i.g7, ... ltJd7 and ... ltJe7, and sometimes even ... a6, ... f6 and ... c6! Such positions are not easy to crack and contain an elastic energy, which is to say that too hurried an advance by White can provoke a dynamic

counterattack. Nevertheless, it shouldn't sur- prise anyone that White can achieve the better game if he plays accurately. The best approach W is to advance slowly and only with support; af- ter all, Black isn't going anywhere! Probably 4 ... ~c6 (D) is the most interesting of the 'irregular' choices. w This attacks White's d-pawn. Black's idea is to reply to 5 ~f3 with 5 ... SLg4, further straining the defence of d4. Instead, 5 SLe3 opens vari- ous possibilities, induding 5 ... ~f6 (threaten- ing ... ~g4) 6 ~f3 O-O 7 SLe2, and here Davies likes the sequence 7 ... e6 8 O-O ~e7!? followed by ... b6 and ... SLb7, which is an 'improved' Hippopotamus due to Black's light-square pres- sure and possible central breaks (which is not to say that he'll achieve equality against perfect play, but you can have some fun here). In place of this, Velimirovic-Davies, Vrnjacka Banja 1991 saw 5 SLb5 (a move that Davies said drove him away from playing 4 ... ~c6) 5 ... a6 6 SLxc6+ bxc6 7 ~f3 f5!? (Davies cites grandmaster games which went 7 ... SLg4 8 O-O 'iWb8!? 9 h3 SLxf3 10 l:i.xf3 and 7 ... ~f6 8 O-O O-O 9 'iWel! with ideas of e5, f5 and/or ~4, depending upon Black's response; he rightly prefers White's chances in both cases) 8 e5 ~h6 9 'iVe2 e6 10 SLe3 O-O 11 O-O-O SLd7. Black has his pieces out, but he lacks space and his g7 -bishop is se- verely restricted. In the game, White expanded with h3, g4-g5 and h4-h5 with an excellent at- tack. For more on ... ~c6, see the next note (in which ... a6 and a4 are played before ... ~c6). Let's return to the game move, 4 ... a6 (D). It is sometimes called 'Tiger's Modern', af- ter Grandmaster Tiger Hillarp Persson, and has an even more modern feel than 4 ... c6. For one thing, Black doesn't even feint at contesting one of the four central squares. Such rook's- pawn pushes are increasingly common for both players in contemporary chess, representing a flight from some of the heavy theory associated with the traditional face-off of central pawns. These relatively noncommittal moves have a positive purpose (in this case, the support of ... b5 and ... SLb7), but they also serve a preven- tative function that can frustrate typical plans of the opponent. Here 4 ... a6 may remind you of the Najdorf Sicilian, in that it prevents SLb5. In- deed, the moves ... c5 and ... cxd4 often follow, when a very Sicilian-like position arises. Assuming that he continues with 5 ... b5, Black has played his first five moves with only one piece developed and a single central pawn mod- estly situated on the third rank. Why does he do this? One motivation is pragmatic: White's theoretically weakest point in this formation is e4 (as it is d4 in the King's Indian Defence structure with pawns on c4, d4 and e4), be- cause that square can't be defended by the f- or d-pawn. Thus both the moves ... J.b7 and ... b4 will increase the pressure on that point. Like- wise, ... ~f6 at some point attacks e4, and if White plays e5, Black can land a knight on d5, a post that is serendipitously strengthened by a pawn on b5 or b4 (because White cannot as easily play c4 to attack the knight on d5). Black might even find a way to make the move ... f5 work, perhaps after ... e6; notice that these are both moves that support the influence of Black's bishop on b7 down the light-squared long diagonal. Ultimately, Black's ideas and White's counterstrategies are hard to pin down

in advance, and will depend upon the opportu- nities presented by the opponent. 54Jf3 B 5 .lie3 is often played, and can easily trans- pose, for example, to the note to White's 7th or 8th move below. 5 a4, preventing ... b5, is a 'natural' response, at least for a player without a lot of experience with this system. But after 5 ... 4Jc6! (D), Black has improved upon 4 ... 4Jc6 because b5 is de- nied to a white bishop or knight, and should White play d5, Black's knight has access to M. In addition, White can only play O-O-O at the risk of exposing his king to a dangerous attack because of the weakened queenside. w The only potential risk for Black would be in the line 6 d5 4Jb4 (6 ... 4Jd4 7 .lie3 c5 ap- pears logical, but 8 dxc6 4Jxc6 9 4Jd5! targets Black's weakened b6-square) 7 a5. With this advance, White stops ... a5 and now threatens :a4 or a knight retreat followed by c3, trap- ping Black's knight. (Instead, the immediate 7 4Jbl threatens c3, but 7 ... a5! 8 c3 4Ja6leaves Black with better development, prospects of ... 4Jc5, and an extended long diagonal.) After 7 a5, however, Black stands quite securely if he plays 7 ... e6 8 .l:!.a4 c5!, as in Mikhailovsky- Hillarp Persson, Gothenburg 2003.
5. .. b5
This is Black's idea: he will forego a central pawn challenge until after he develops by ... .lib7 and ... 4Jd7. Then after ... c5 and ... cxd4, Sicilian themes can arise, or the game can go its own way, as it does in this contest. 6 .lid3 (D) 6 ••• 4Jd7 Relatively noncommittal; Black would like to playa speedy ... c5 in some lines. There's no way to give a complete survey of this variation, so I'll confine myself to some examples; these will be a little dense but hopefully useful if you're in- terested in 4 ... a6. I shall be citing the games and opinions of Tiger Hillarp Persson a lot, because he is the leading contemporary exponent of 4 ... a6 in Modem Defence lines. Hillarp Persson prefers 6 ... 4Jd7 over 6 ... .lib7, when he feels that 7 a4! is good for White. This may well be so, yet the latter move is almost never played! Rather than use mountains of analysis, let's fol- low some logical moves: 7 ... M 8 4Je2 4Jd7 9 O-O 4Jgf6 (9 ... e6 allows 10 f5!, opening lines for both White's rook on f1 and his dark- squared bishop, always a dangerous proposi- tion for Black) 10 e5 4Jd5 (D). w If White can rid himself of the knight on d5, he can trust that his large, mobile centre will work to his advantage. In addition, moves such as e6 and 4Jg5 can be effective. For his part,

The move-orders can be confusing; for the record, after 7 ~e3, 7 ... cS 8 eS is the note to White's 8th move, and 7 ... ~b7 8 eS is the note to 7 ... cS. White can also play 7 O-O ~b7 (perhaps not best; by transposition, Stefansson-Hillarp Pers- son, Gausdal 1996 went 7 ... cS 8 dxcS tbxcs 9 ~e3 ~b7 10 ~xcS dxcS 11 eS, when Black held the balance following 1l...'iVb6 12 ~e4 ~xe413 tbxe4tbh6! 14c40-0).

Notice how many options both sides have on every move! 7 .•. c5 7 ... ~b7 is the main alternative, which often transposes, although 8 ~e3 might now be met by 8 ... tbh6 (rather than 8 ... cS); for example, 9 ~e2 (9 ~e4 'i!i'c8) 9 ... e6 (Finkel mentions 9 ...

Today this has become a very popular move- order. Sometimes it is a prelude to fairly con- ventional set-ups involving ... d6. But Black can also play 4 ... dS next (as he does in most of this section), staking out a central presence on the light squares. This strategy resembles Black's in variations of the Caro-Kann Defence (which sometimes directly transpose to these lines), the Scandinavian Defence and the Alekhine

w Defence. It seems odd to move so quickly away from the dark-square strategy that 1...g6 im- plies, but it turns out that the combination of ... g6, ... c6 and ... dS yields a solid position, whether or not White commits to a big centre. In general, the variation with ... c6 and ... dS suits players who want to play safely and not be too short of space. 4f4 Again, this is the most critical test. Indeed, f4 lines are especially appropriate versus the Modem Defence; they pose great danger for Black and at the same time are less risky than similar systems in other defences. Why? Be- cause in other lines with broad centres such as the Four Pawns King's Indian, the Exchange Griinfeld, or even the Four Pawns Attack versus the Alekhine Defence, Black's pieces generally develop more quickly than in the Modem. In the next game we shall see 4 lbf3 and 4 .llc4. 4 ... dS This move is one of the main points behind
3. .. c6: Black switches from the dark-square em-
phasis of 1...g6 and 2 ... .llg7 to a direct assault on White's light squares. In particular, White's e4-square can no longer be defended by pawns. Of course, it's not too late to return to 4 ... d6, which we saw above. S eS (D)

g4, which might not seem important until you realize that Black intends to put a bishop on g4, appropriately outside the pawn-chain which is about to be constructed by the move ... e6. Normally, that bishop will subsequently be ex- changed after White plays h3, when the useful- ness of ... hS becomes apparent: it can both prevent White's g4 directly and, in some cases, it will advance to h4 and restrain two pawns (on h3 and g2) with one. Black also secures an effective outpost for his knight on fS; and since the knight will prob- ably come there via h6, it's handy that the move ... hS prevents g4. It also eliminates h4-hS, a standard way in which White normally meets the combination of ... g6 and ... lbh6. Ultimately, then, Black sets up a fortress on the kingside with pawns on e6, f7, g6 and hS, daring White to expand in that sector. I should mention that Black can play other moves here. One such is S. .. lbh6, still looking at the light squares, and if White responds 6 lbf3, Black can reply with 6 ... .llg4, or even the strange-looking 6 ... f6, attacking the front of the pawn-chain (contrary to some of the old text- books, attacking the front of a pawn-chain is very often a productive way to attack it).

12 O-O ttJd7 (D)
Several top-level games have reached this point. Black has done everything right from a positional point of view: he rid himself of his bad bishop, block;lded White's centre (immo- bilizing his bishops), and established a 'one re- strains two' situation on the kingside (h-pawn versus h- and g-pawns). Nevertheless, White's record from this position has been extremely good. It's not only his two bishops that make the difference, but his greater command of territory. In combination with his lead in development, this is effective in squelching his opponent's counterplay. The position looks closed, but White will be able to operate on the queenside, and as long as he can keep lines open there, his bishops will exert a powerful influence in the long term. Similarly, any pawn-breaks like ... c5 or .. .f6 tend to open up lines for White's pieces, so Black usually has to stay passive. Finally, Black's pawn on h4 can become a target for White's pieces. Interestingly, if you look at other openings such as the King's Indian De- fence in which White's pawns on b2 and a3 are held up by the manoeuvre ... a5-a4, it will often happen that the pawn on a4 can be attacked to good effect by a queen on dl, bishop on c2 and
72 MASTERING THE CHESS OPENINGS
knight on c3. The mirror image of this attack shows up in the main game and notes below. 13b3 White anticipates playing c4. The somewhat more accurate 13 tt:Je2! has been played several times, covering g3 and freeing the c-pawn to move. Then Sivokho-Chernyshov, St Peters- burg 2000 illustrates the fundamental strate- gies: 13 ... b5!? (13 ... ii.f8 14 a4 prevents ... ii.a3 . ideas) 14 c3! (D) (preparing b3 and c4, rather than the immediate 14 b3 b4!, after which Black succeeded in contesting White's queenside ex- pansion in Smirnov-Kobaliya, European Ch, Ohrid 2001: 15 c4 bxc3 16 ~fcl! ii.f8 17 tt:Jxc3 !?, and Black could have just about lev- elled matters with 17 ... ii.a3 18 ~c2 'iVb6, based upon the tactic 19 tt:Ja4 tt:Jxd4!).

Black's position doesn't look so bad, but he lacks a plan. The game continued 14 ... tt:Jb6 (af- ter 14 ... ii.f8, one good line is 15 a4 a6 16 axb5 axb5 17 b3 with the idea c4) 15 b3 (here's the point: White has queenside play and Black has nothing equivalent; compare the comments in the main game) 15 ... ii.f8 16 ~fc1 'iWd7 17 c4 bxc4 18 bxc4 dxc4 19 ii.xc4 ii.e7 (if 19 ... tt:Jxc4 20 ~xc4, White's rooks will dominate the c- and b-files) 20 ii.a6 tt:Jd5 21 ~abl O-O, and here the most direct course was suggested by Lukacs: 22 ~b7 'iVd8 23 ii.d3! with ongoing pressure. 13 ... ii.f8 14 tt:Je2 14 a4!? would prevent the resource in the next note. 14 ••. ii.e7 This was Black's opportunity to exploit the slight weakening caused by 13 b3: 14 ... ii.a3!, and if 15 c4, 15 ... a5!. Then it's awkward for White to expel the bishop from a3 or utilize the c-file. 15 c4! (D) Neither side can do much on the kingside. White's greater control of territory, on the other hand, gives his pieces quick access to the queen- side if the play opens up there, so he is happy to advance on that wing.

15 .•• tt:Jb6 Black wants to lure White's pawns forward immediately and close the queenside. His alter- natives illustrate just how important space can be; in spite of the many strong players who have defended the variation beginning with ll...h4, it's possible that Black's position is simply lost: a) Grishchuk-Kalantarian, Anibal Open, Li- nares 1999 saw a straightforward execution of White's strategy: 15 ... 'iVa5 16 a3 ~f8 17 ~fc1 <t,;g7 18 ~h2 a6 19 ~c2 b5 20 c5 'iVc7 21 a4 l:ihb8 22 b4 bxa4 23 ~xa4 ~a7 24 ~ca2 ':ba8 25 ii.xa6 tt:Jb8 26 b5 cxb5 27 ii.xb5 and White emerged a pawn up. b) 15 ... ~f8 is perhaps the most logical move, scurrying over to connect rooks, but it hasn't done much better than the alternatives. One smooth example went 16 ~fc 1 ~g7 17 a3 tt:Jb6 18 ~h2 a5 19 c5 tt:Jd7 20 b4 axb4 21 axb4 b5! 22 ii.c2 'fIic7 (there is only one file open now, so Black hurries to make sure that White doesn't control it) 23 'iVc3 'iVb7 24 tt:Jgl!

finds it so hard to contest White on the queen- side in this line. 16l:!fc1 16 cS is also perfectly fine, since White's b4-bS can't be stopped without allowing some other type of activity. 16 •. .'~f8 17 c5! ttJd7 18 b4 a6 19 a4 Black can't really stop this stereotyped at- tack. 19 ... ~g7 20 ~h2 'fic7 21 ttJgl!?

The remarkable 3 ... dS!?, intending 4 ttJxdS c6 S ttJe3 'fixd4 or 4 exdS ttJf6 (with the idea S ..Itc4 ttJbd7 and ... ttJb6) is a speculative idea which has received recent attention. It is proba- bly in White's favour, but remains playable. You can research this in books and databases. 4ttJf3 White plays the natural developing move, aiming at the centre. Of course, there are many alternatives such as 4 i.e3 and 4 ..ItgS, and 4 h4 is certainly possible. But the popular 4 ..Itc4 (D) leads to particularly interesting play.
B
That directly discourages ... dS, and it puts a priority on quick development, sometimes hav- ing in mind a direct attack. The play is complex, generally going in one of two main directions: a) Black should avoid overextending by 4 ... b5?! 5 i.b3 b4 6 ttJce2 ttJf6?! 7 e5 ttJd5 8 a3! bxa3 9 ':'xa3 O-O, as in Georgadze-Radev, Tbilisi 1971, when White can claim much the better game following 10 ttJf3 d6 11 ttJf4!. b) 4 ... d5 (this is the way to go if Black wants to insist upon the ... b5 break) S exd5 b5 6 i.b3

b4 7 lDce2 (or 7 lDa4, eyeing c5 and preparing a3) 7 ... cxd5 (D). w Black has played this way many times with passable results. He gives himself extra operat- ing room on the queenside and hopes to de- velop rapidly there ( ... a5 and ... .iLa6 is a natural follow-up). Nevertheless, his queenside struc- ture is a little airy: squares such as a4, a5, c5 and c6 will permanently lack pawn protection. Therefore, White should maintain some edge by gaining access to them; for example, 8.iLd2!? (the similar 8 a3 bxa3 9 I;1xa3 gives White posi- tional pressure against the queenside with max- imum flexibility) 8 ... a5 9 a3 bxa3 10 lIxa3 lDc6 11 lDf3 lDf6?! (ll...e6! anticipates 12 .iLa4 lDge7, when White might want to reposi- tion via 13 .iLb4!? i.d7 14.iLc5) 12 .iLa4 .iLd7 13 'iWal 'iVb6 14 1:.b3 'iWa7 15 .iLxc6 .iLxc6 16 lDe5 'ilVa6, Schrnittdiel-Vogt, Austrian Team Ch 1999. Here White could safely play 17 ~xa5! 'ilVxa5 18 .iLxa5 with the idea 18 .. Jha5?? 191Ib8#. c) Black's most common reply is 4 ... d6 (reaching the same position as after 3 ... d6 4 .iLc4 c6). Then White's favourite independent move is the primitive 5 'ilVf3!?, in order to in- duce 5 ... e6 and create dark-square weaknesses on d6 and f6 (5 ... lDf6?! 6 e5 doesn't work out well). Then one main line goes 6 lDge2 lDd7 7 O-O lDgf6 8 .iLb3 0-09 .iLg5 (D). This curious position typifies many variations of the Modem Defence. Black has a backward pawn-structure and passively-placed pieces, but his position remains elastic and he is pre- pared to react dynamically to advances by his opponent, much as in the Hedgehog Variation of the English Opening and certain Sicilian

Defences. With that in mind, let's examine a couple of strategies: c1) Elsewhere in this book we've seen the kind of pawn-structure arising from 9 .. :~e7 10 .l:tadl h6 11 .iLh4 e5; for example, in the King's Indian Defence, Philidor Defence, and espe- cially the Pirc Defence. Nunn-Fauland, Vienna 1991 continued 12 ~e3 (White's pieces have good scope and he intends to break down the e5 strongpoint) 12 ... .l:te8!? (12 ... g5 13 .iLg3 lDh5 keeps lines closed and is at any rate safer) 13 f4! exd4 (initiating exchanges that leave White with the more active pieces; 13 ... exf4 14 lDxf4 '1t>h8 15 lDfe2 may improve, but throws Black on the defensive) 14 ~xd4 lDxe4 15 .iLxe7 .iLxd4+ 16 I;1xd4 lDxc3 17 lDxc3 .l:txe7 18 .l:txd6 lDf8 (in Nunn-Ehlvest, Skelleftea 1989, Black played 18 ... '1t>g7?!, when 19 f5! gxf5 20 .l:txf5 created two new weaknesses in his position) 19 .l:td8 b6 20 a4! .iLb7 21 .l:td6!. White has a large advan- tage, intending f5 and, under the right circum- stances, a5. c2) 9 ... b5! is more in the modem spirit: Black plays flexibly; he might want to follow up with ... b4 and ... .iLa6, or ... a5 and ... i.a6, or simply ... .iLb7. Now: c21) The forcing 10 e5!? is terribly compli- cated after 10 ... dxe5 11 'ilVxc6 .l:tb8, when a simple response to 12 lDxb5 is 12 ... .iLb7!, in- tending 13 ~c7 .iLxg2! or 13 ~c4 ~b6 with the ideas ... .iLd5 and ... .l:tfc8. So in Baramidze- Iordachescu, Dresden 2003, White played 12 dxe5 lDxe5 13 ~c5 lDfd7! 14 .iLxd8 lDxc5 15 .iLe7 lDxb3 16 axb3 .l:te8 17 .l:txa7 lDc6 18 .iLd6 lDxa7 19 .iLxb8 lDc6 20 .iLf4, and here Black's easiest course was 20 ... e5! with the idea 21 i.e3 lDd4.

c22) 10 a3 'fic7 (D) (l0. .. .ltb7 11 ':adl 'Wic7 also looks playable). w After 11 dS?! (straightforward development by 11 ':adl followed by ':fel appears best) l1...cxdS! 12 exdS .ltb7! 13l2JxbS iVcS, Black gets the pawn back with excellent activity. Rublevsky-Iordachescu, European Ch, Silivri 2003 went 14 l2Jbc3 l2JxdS IS l2JxdS .ltxdS 16 .ltxdS exdS (l6 ... l2JeS! is also good) 17 c3 l2JeS 18 'fig3 ':ab8 19 ':ab1 l2Jc4 with a nice initia- tive for Black. Instead, 14 .ltxf6l2Jxf6 ISl2Jbc3 l2JxdS 16l2JxdS .ltxdS 17 .ltxdS exdS 18 c3 l:l:ab8 19 ':abl was suggested, but then 19 ... 'fic4 20 ':fdl ':fe8 gives Black good counterplay. For example, the isolated queen's pawns can't be blockaded due to the tactic 21 l2Jd4 .ltxd4 22 ':xd4 ':xb2!. Black can fall victim to sudden attacks in these lines with 4 .ltc4 d6 S 'fif3. But some Modem Defence players like to provoke White into aggressive activity, trusting that their com- pact position can repel any rash advances. We return to the calmer 4l2Jf3 (D): 4 ... d5 5 h3 Over the years, this has become White's most popular choice. He expends a tempo, but prevents Black's plan of playing ... .ltg4 and ... .ltxf3, which is a good minor-piece trade-off in what will be a semi-closed position. After playing ... .ltxf3 and ... e6, Black is left with his good bishop and believes that his knights will be well-placed in the resulting structure. Three brief examples: a) S .lte2 .ltg4 6 eS e6 7 O-O l2Je7 8 h3 (slow) 8 ... .ltxf3 9 .ltxf3 cS (central counterattack along the lines of the French Defence makes the

knights as effective as the bishops) 10 l2JbS?! (correct in principle, but it's too time-consum- ing to try to prop up the central pawn-chain; Black has only a small edge after 10 dxcSl2Jbc6 11 .ltf4 iVaS 12 l:tel 'fixcS) 10 ... O-O 11 c3 l2Jbc6 12 l2Jd6 (White can no longer hold the centre: 12 l2Ja3 cxd4 13 cxd4 'ifb6 14 l2Jc2 l2JfS) 12 ... cxd4 13 cxd4 'iWb6 14 .lte3 and now 14 ... l2Jc8 IS l2Jxc8 l:.axc8 16 'fid2 wasn't bad for Black in Rozentalis-Blatny, Warsaw 1999, as he can break up the centre with ... f6. How- ever, he could have played the classic exchange sacrifice to destroy White's centre: 14 ... l:tad8! IS 'iid2lhd6! 16 exd6l2JfS (D). w In this position both d-pawns will fall, leav- ing Black's centre pawns unopposed and mo- bile. b) White has to be careful not to give Black a favourable French Defence in which he has exchanged off his light-squared bishop and re- tains excellent knights. For example, A.Belu- sov-Yurtaev, Seversk 1997 saw S eS .ltg4 6 h3

The point isn't immediately clear, since the follow-up ... dxe4 and ... liJfS won't normally have much impact if White de- fends his centre by c3. Instead, Black's main idea is an outrageous reorganization by ... f6 and ... liJf7! That looks like a misprint: after all, by playing in this manner Black is using valu- able tempi to block off his own bishop on g7, place a knight on the superficially uninspiring square f7, and weaken the e6-square! Never- theless, we have to remember that chess is a matter of specifics and timing. It turns out that Black's cluster of pieces on the kingside serves not only the purpose of preventing the advance eS by White, but of preparing ... eS for himself. For his part, White is happy to accept the gift of so much time, and will try to show that his op- ponent's strategy is too slow. 6 i..f4 A good, straightforward developing move.

With 9 b3, White dares Black to make use of his eccentric set-up. He has various ways to do so, none completely clear: a) It's not obvious how White answers 9 ... eS.

White adopts the classical development of his knights, as we saw in Volume 1 versus the Pirc Defence. He is satisfied with the 'ideal' two-pawn centre and follows the textbook ad- vice of bringing knights into play before bish- ops. Variations with 4 i.gS are by no means harmless, but less frequently seen.

By moving his knight first, Black supports ... c5 and perhaps ... e5, while keeping his bishop on the c8-h3 diagonal for a move, in case e5- e6 becomes bothersome. Nevertheless, 6 ... tLld7 has its own drawbacks, and we need to under- stand the implications of various move-orders. At this junction there are two natural alterna- tives: a) Black is behind in development in these ... a6/ ... b5 lines, and so both sides should be on the lookout for direct attacks. For example, an extremely important attacking theme arises in the variation 6 ... tLlf6? 7 e5! tLlfd7 (7 ... dxe5 8 tLlxe5 .ltb7 9 .ltf3!) 8 tLlg5! (or 8 e6!, since 8 .. .fxe6 9 tLlg5 attacks e6 and prepares moves such as .ltg4/f3 and .l:.el, and the common de- fensive idea 9 ... tLlf8? gets hit with 10 .ltxb5+! intending 1O ... axb5 11 'ili'f3) 8 ... dxe5 9 dxe5 and now 9 ... e6 (to prevent 10 e6) is strongly met by 10 .ltxb5!, again with the idea 1O ... axb5 11 'ili'f3. If Black instead plays 9 ... tLlxe5, he comes out on the short end of the long forced sequence 10 'ili'xd8+ ~xd8 11 f4 h6 12 fxe5 hxg5 13 .l:.xf7 .ltxe5 14 .ltxg5; for example, 14 ... tLlc6 15 .ltf3 .ltxh2+ 16 ~f2 .ltb7 17 .l:i.el .ltd6 18 .ltxc6 .ltxc6 19 .ltxe7+. b) The obvious alternative is 6 ... .ltb7, when 7 .i:!.el tLld7 transposes to the game. In order to counter this move-order, White might try 7 a4. This leads to very complicated play, with White striving for a small advantage; for example, 7 ... b4 8 tLla2 a5 (perhaps 8 ... .ltxe4 9 tLlg5 .ltb7 10 .ltf3 'ili'c8 should be played) 9 e5!? tLlh6!? 10 c3 bxc3 11 tLlxc3 O-O 12 'ili'b3. Some of these choices come down to a matter of personal style. For example, even 7 e5!? has been tried, hoping for an effective 8 e6 or 8 tLlg5. Then 7 ... tLlh6 and 7 ... e6 are solid answers, but the whole game lies ahead. We now return to 6 ... tLld7 (D):

Hillarp Persson asserts that White can claim superiority by 7 d5 .ltb7 (Black's game after 7 ... e6 8 tLld4!

82 MASTERING THE CHESS OPENINGS
w The position after 7 ... .1Lb7 has been the start- ing point for a good many Modem Defence bat- tles. It embodies the fight between classical and hypermodern development. S.1Lfl White moves his bishop out of the way, both protecting the e4-pawn and strengthening its potential advance to e5. In the next game we'll look at 8 .1Lg5. S•.• c5 Black begins his attack on d4. This com- pletes the plan laid out by 4 ... a6. 9a4 In the Classical Variation, this pawn advance is White's default strategy. White lures Black's b-pawn forward and then attacks it, opening lines for his own benefit. 9• •• b4 9 ... cxd4 10 ttJxd4 b4 transposes into the note above on 7 ... c5; 9 ... bxa4?! 10 l:txa4 not only re- duces the pressure on White's centre (via ... b4), but creates weaknesses on Black's queenside, notably on a5 and a6. 10 ttJd5 ttJgf6 (D) Black can't just toss out moves in this sys- tem; for example, 1O ... e6? 11 .1Lf4! was already practically decisive in the game Honfi-Vadasz, Kecskemet 1975, based upon 11...exd5? 12 exd5+ ttJe7 13 .1Lxd6 .1Lf6 14 .1Lxe7 .1Lxe7 15 d6, winning. 11 ttJxf6+ Or: a) 11 dxc5 ttJxc5 resembles a Sicilian De- fence.

White frequently places his bishop on this active square, from which point it pins the en- emy e-pawn, participates in direct attacks, and stays out of the way of White's e-file play (as opposed to 7 ~e3 or 8 ~e3, for example). From Black's perspective, the bishop doesn't defend against ... c5, and it can become isolated from the central squares if driven back to h4 by the move ... h6.

This is an extremely solid set-up. The play- ers can also reach the position of the main game via 3 tbf3 d6 (3 ... c5 is the Hyper-Accelerated Dragon Variation of the Sicilian Defence) 4 ~d3 (4 c3 tbf6 5 tbbd2 O-O 6 ~e2 transposes the note to 5 ~d3 below) 4 ... tbf6 5 0-00-06 c3. One of the most frequently-used non-trans- positional lines with 3 tbf3 is 3 ... d6 4 ~c4 tbf6 5 'iVe2. White has a simple idea: e5 followed by e6 and/or quick development. In many cases he clears the back rank and castles queenside. In response, Black can play 5 ... c6, to provide an anchor for his knight on d5 if White chooses to advance his e-pawn. Or, more interestingly, 5 ... 0-06 e5 tbe8 (D). w This is a strategy in the spirit of many mod- em openings: permitting White's centre to ad- vance so as to undermine and break it down. Two examples of contrasting pawn-play and piece-play on Black's part: a) 7 h3 (White tries to deny Black's c8- bishop any active squares) 7 ... c5!

The attraction of White's formation is that the pawns on c3 and d4 blunt the influence of Black's bishop on g7. Then White can develop without having to worry over his centre. On the other hand, the formation with c3 is rather pas- sive, putting no real pressure on Black. Thus Black has plenty ofleeway in developing. There have been many games with this line over the years (as well as with White's bishop on e2 and queen's knight on d2, as in the previous note), but I'll limit myself to a popular remedy that fits the occasion: 6 ... lbc6 Although 6. .. lbbd7 planning ... eS is perfectly playable, it blocks Black's light-squared bishop and attacks nothing. By means of 6 ... lbc6, Black wants to play ... eS with direct pressure on d4, in order to force a commitment from White. Al- ternatively, Black has played 6 ... cS, planning ... lbc6 with the same end in mind. 7lbbd2 This is a natural move, yet it blocks the bishop on c1, so White sometimes waits and brings the knight to a3. To maintain flexibility, White often does that by 7 h3, because it's a move he plays in almost every line anyway, and of course it prevents ... Bg4. By looking at the lines which follow, you can see that 7 h3 usu- ally transposes. Other instructive choices: a) 7 dS gains time and prevents ... eS for the time being, but exposes the d-pawn to under- mining via ... c6 and/or ... e6 after 7 ... lbb8 (D): w al) 8 l:te1 c6, and if White plays 9 c4, then Black's g7 -bishop has regained its power on the long diagonal. a2) After the immediate 8 c4, 8 ... c6 is also fine for Black, while 8 ...

Averbakh Variation Finally, we take a brief look at 1 e4 g6 2 d4 i..g7 3 c4, which is sometimes called the Averbakh Variation (not to be confused with the Aver- bakh System in the King's Indian, which arises after 1 d4 liJf6 2 c4 g6 3 liJc3 i..g7 4 e4 d6 5 i..e2 O-O 6 i..g5). This is White's most impor- tant alternative to the lines above, and in fact, for some players 3 c4 has been a disincentive to using 1 ... g6 at all. It's a set-up that may well ap- peal to those who play 1 d4, since 1 d4 g6 2 e4 i..g7 3 c4leads to the same position, and the re- sulting pawn-structures will be familiar to most of them. In fact, the game will very often trans- pose to a King's Indian Defence (if Black plays an early ... d6 and ... liJf6) or a Benoni-related defence if Black plays ... c5 and White replies d5; then Black may continue ... d6, ... e6 and ... exd5 as in the Modem Benoni and offshoots, or ... d6 and ... e5, a structure from various lesser- used lines. In addition, Black can choose from a variety of unique, non-transpositional lines, a few of which we'll identify in the following game. 1 e4 Sashikiran - Kakageldiev Asian Team Ch, Esfahan 2005 Another way to get to our main line is 1 d4 g6 2 c4 (or 1 c4 g6 2 d4) 2 ... i..g7 3 e4. If White plays 3 liJc3 instead, 3 ... c5 4 d5 i..xc3+!? 5 bxc3 f5 is one of those eccentric variations that has been around for many years. Black tries to show that his knight-pair and White's weak- nesses are sufficient compensation for his op- ponent's bishop-pair and influence on Black's vulnerable dark squares. This line has never re- ally caught on at the top levels, but can make for creative and instructive chess if you're looking to experiment.

3 ... d6 After 3 ... c5, 4 liJf3 cxd4 5 liJxd4 liJc6 is a Maroczy Bind Sicilian Defence, and 4 d5 d6 may transpose into some form of Benoni. In the latter case, Black may not arrive at one of the more dynamic lines, however, particularly be- cause if he plays the moves ... e6 and ... exd5,
B
White has the option of recapturing with his e- pawn. 4 liJc3 liJc6 4 ... liJf6 directly transposes to the King's In- dian Defence. 4 ... liJd7 can go every which way; the most important reaction is 5liJf3, if only be- cause in many cases, the move liJf3 has already been played on one of the moves 1-4. Then there are some unique lines after 5 ... e5 6 i..e2 (D).

Now 6 ... liJgf6 will almost certainly trans- pose to a line ofthe Classical King's Indian De- fence. Alternatively: a) 6 ... liJh6?! might be a handy way to sup- port ... f5, but it runs into 7 h4!. It's always im- portant for Black to watch out for this move when he can't respond to it by ... h5 or ... h6 (in order to answer h5 with ... g5). There can follow 7 ... f6 (7 ... exd4 8liJxd4liJf6 9 h5 doesn't solve anything) 8 h5 (8 i..xh6 i..xh6 9 h5 is also good; White has ideas of liJh4 and i..g4) 8 ... c6

b) 6.Jbe7 (D) has been used a lot over the years, but White has generally done well. w Black's idea is to enforce ... fS without play- ing ... ltJf6 and then having to move the knight again before being able to move the f-pawn. Al- ternatively, he can play for ... exd4 and ... ltJc6. The strategy is in itself logical enough, but without a knight on f6, White's centre isn't sub- ject to much pressure and Black's pieces are a bit cramped; for example, his queen can't use the e7-square. In addition, White gains ideas of h4-hS, whereas the useful move ..te3 (perhaps planning dxeS and cS at some point) isn't sub- ject to counterattack by ... ltJg4. Here are a few, brief, examples of the main lines: bI) 7 O-O O-O S ..te3 h6?! (S ... fS?! is risky when ltJgS is available; for example, 9 ltJgS ltJf6 10 dxeS dxeS 11 cS!

In this game and notes, we see various irreg- ular set-ups for Black versus the 'Averbakh' formation with c4, d4 and e4. While playable, they all suffer from the same defect: a lack of space. Whether Black stands objectively worse or not, most leading players don't want to deal with the difficulties that this presents in prac- tice, and either avoid it, or take the opportunity to transpose to the King's Indian.
4 Modern Queenside Fianchetto
In this chapter I'll be examining modem queen- side fianchetto systems, primarily those with ... b6 on one of the first two moves, but also I b3. These aren't extremely popular at the very top levels, but they have been played consis- tently by strong grandmasters as well as mas- ters. With ... b6 and ... i.b7, Black's play tends to be concentrated upon controlling the central light squares with moves such as ... e6, ... f5, . ..'Df6/e7 and ... i.b4; if he succeeds in doing so, his bishop on b7 will gain in strength. White will often challenge those squares and try to limit the bishop's influence by d5, e4 and/or f3, supported by tt:'lc3, i.d3 and "VJiIe2/c2. A comparison with 1...g6 of the last chapter is interesting. Perhaps the most significant dif- ference is that ... b6 doesn't contribute to early castling, which is a traditional opening prior- ity. On the other hand, in the critical lines,
1...b6 and an early ... i.b7 attacks an unde-
fended pawn on e4. This imparts a certain forcing quality to it and limits White's op- tions. By contrast 1...g6 and 2 ... i.g7 attacks a pawn on d4 that is naturally protected by the queen on d 1, so White is afforded more leeway in his development. When White plays 1 b3, his opponent doesn't necessarily feel obliged to play for an initia- tive and frequently refuses to present the broad target that White usually does versus 1...b6. You should remember that White's view of the chess opening is different from Black's, in that he doesn't want to arrive at an equal position at too early a stage of the game. Therefore 1 b3, while respectable and sporting a considerable body of theory, isn't used as often as one might expect by the same leading players who are willing to enter into ... g6 and ... b6 systems as Black. Nevertheless, a loyal band of 1 b3 devo- tees have developed ways to emerge from the opening with unbalanced positions. That out- come will satisfy players who are more con- cerned with having an original game than achieving an advantage from the opening. Owen Defence
1 e4 b6 2 d4 i.b7 (D)
Obviously White could have begun with 1 d4 as well, and in fact many games go 1 d4 e6 2 e4 b6 (2 ... d5 is a French Defence) and 3 ... i.b7. With either move-order, playing ... b6 and ... e6 on the first two moves has a few subtleties, as we'll see in the first few games. w In the eyes of traditional theory, 1...b6 has a varying reputation depending upon White's first move. For example, 1 c4 b6 (the English Defence) is a respectable unbalancing contin- uation. There have been thousands of master games with it, and recent theory is extensive, with books and lengthy articles devoted to its intricacies.
1 e4 b6, the Owen Defence, is a different
matter. It was looked at askance by masters for most of the 20th century, in spite of having the- ory associated with it which goes as far back as the 19th. Even after the kingside fianchetto of the last chapter, 1 e4 g6, achieved respectabil- ity, the queenside fianchetto was still frowned upon when White retained full freedom with his central structure. In the past two decades, however, 1 e4 b6 2 d4 i.b7 has been used by a fair number of strong grandmasters and has re- ceived renewed attention from theoreticians.
MODERN QUEENSIDE FIANCHETTO 95
As mentioned above, White's e-pawn is un- der attack. In the majority of cases, he will de- fend it while developing by 3 i.d3 or 3 ttJc3. Assuming that White doesn't follow 3 i.d3 with an early ttJc3, these two methods are fun- damentally different, although they often lead to types of positions that you may recognize from other openings. Let's begin with a classic game. I've adjusted the opening move sequence so as to address some basic move-order issues straightaway. Dorfman - Miles Tilburg 1992
1 e4 b6 2 d4 i.b7 3 i.d3 (D)
3 dS e6 isn't dangerous, because Black will succeed in breaking up White's centre (with ... ttJf6 and ... c6, if necessary), but I'm surprised that I can only find a handful of very low-rated games with 3 eS, since 1 b3 eS 2 i.b2 e4 is a legitimate line in which ... dS is played soon thereafter. The idea is that after 3 eS d6 (to dis- solve the cramping e-pawn) 4 ttJf3, Black's queenside light squares are weakened. Finally,
3 f3 is logical, erecting a barrier against the b7-
bishop. Then Black has many ways to go; for example, 3 ... e6 (3 ... g6!?) 4 ttJc3 (4 c4 is a line of the English Defence, examined below) 4 ... ttJf6 (4 ... ttJh6!? intending .. .fS) S i.e3 and now S. .. cS or S. .. dS.
B
3 ••• ttJf6 The ... b6 systems are flexible, so you see a wide variety of moves at nearly every juncture. This move and the main alternative, 3 ... e6, con- test the light squares, which is consistent with Black's strategy as a whole. The differences between them are important enough to warrant a fairly lengthy digression, and Black has a couple of other options. As always, it's impor- tant to understand move-orders in order to get the position you want: a) 3 ... cS?! is positionally suspect due to 4 dS, hemming in Black's queen's bishop. Black has forfeited the option of attacking dS by means of ... c6. b) Black plays 3 ... e6 more frequently than 3 ... ttJf6. It can variously transpose to any of the next few games. Importantly, however, it gives White the option of 4 c4, which is the main line of the English Defence section below (I c4 b6 2 d4 e6 3 e4 i.b7 4 i.d3). An independent line after 3 ... e6 is 4 ttJf3, and now: bl) 4 ... ttJf6?! (probably too provocative) S eS ttJdS 6 a3! cS 7 dxcS i.xcs (D). w This resembles the note to 8 a3 below, except that White hasn't played c3 and therefore can play c4 in one move rather than two. One exam- ple went 8 O-O (8 M i.e7 9 c4 is also good) 8 ... fS!?9c4ttJc71Oi.gS?! (10M!) 1O ... i.xf3! 11i.xd8 i.xd112 i.xc7 ttJa6?

Al- ternatively, White can play S O-O and allow the Sicilian variant S. .. cxd4 6 ttJxd4. In that case, S. .. ttJf6 6 eS ttJdS 7 l:e1 leaves White better de- veloped.
96 MASTERING THE CHESS OPENINGS
c) 3 ... fS? was debated for many years but now it's established that 4 exfS .txg2leads to a losing position after the sequence S 'iihS+ g6 6 fxg6 .tg7, and here the 'traditional' refutation is 7 'iWfS tbf6 (7 ... .tf6? 8 g7 .txg7 9 'iigS forks the bishops on g2 and g7) 8 .th6!!. This does in fact lead to a winning position after 8 ... .txh6 9 gxh7, but the analysis is complicated, and Spin- hoven shows that 7 gxh7+! 'iitf8 8 tbf3! is clearer; for example, 8 ... tbf6 (8 ... .txhl 9 tbeS! .txeS 10 dxeS) 9 'iig6 .txf3 (9 ... .txhl 10.th6 .l:txh7 11 tbgS) 10 .l:.gl .l:txh7 11 'iig3 .te4 12 .txe4 tbxe4 13 'it'f3+ 'iitg8 14 ~xe4 dS IS ~e6+ 'iith8 16 tbc3 c6 17 .tf4. d) An original and infrequently-tested vari- ation (which has been analysed at length by Maurits Wind in Kaissiber) is 3 ... tbc6 (D), at- tacking the d-pawn and intending ... eS. Notice that this is a dark-square strategy, unusual for the Owen Defence. w White has an array of responses to this move, and I'll leave it to the reader to investigate it in depth. Some ideas: dl) 4 dS tbeS S .te2 e6 breaks up White's centre. If he overextends by 6 f4?! tbg6 7 c4, then among other good moves, 7 ... .tb4+ 8 .td2 'Wie7leaves White's centre further exposed. d2) 4 tbe2 tbb4 forces the exchange of White's bishop; considering his extra space, this is not bad for White (for example, S c4 e6 transposes to the English Defence, discussed below), but ceding the bishop-pair may not be to his taste. d3) 4 c3 (Martin gives this an '!') 4 ... eS (the point) S tbf3! (S dS tbce7 goes back to the games of Owen in the 1890s! Black intends ... tbg6, ... .tcS, ... tbf6 and ... c6 in one order or another; S tbe2 dS! is Wind's idea, so as not to cede White the powerful centre and smooth de- velopment that would result from S. .. exd4 6 cxd4 tbb4 7 tbbc3 tbxd3+ 8 'iixd3; after S. .. dS 60-0, both 6 ... tbf6 and 6 ... tbge7 are playable) S. .. exd4 6 cxd4 tbb4 (D) and now: w d31) 7 O-O tbxd3 8 'iixd3 tbf6 9 tbc3 and after 9 ... .te7, as played in Blackburne-Owen, Manchester 1881, 10 dS! would have been strong. Wind suggests 9 ... dS; then Black is walking a narrow path after 10 exdS tbxdS 11 .l:tel+ .te7 12 'iie2 'iid7 13 tbxdS (13 tbeS 'iWe6) 13 ... .txdS 14 .td2 .txf3! IS gxf3 'iitf8, but with the moves ... .td6 and ... hS, he obtains equal chances. d32) 7 .tc4! dS! (after 7 ... .txe4, 8 O-O is "enormously strong", according to Wind, al- though 8 tbc3! may prove to be even better, since 8 ... tbc2+ 9 'iitfl is turning sour for Black) 8 exdS .txdS 9 .te2! (after 9 .txdS tbxdS, nei- ther 10 tbc3 tbxc3 11 bxc3 .td6 nor 100-0 .td6 11 .l:.el + tbge7 is dangerous for Black) 9 ... .tb7!? 10 a3 tbdS. Now BUcker analyses 11 tbeS!? to a moderate advantage for White after ll...c6 (ll...tbge7 12 .tg4!) 12 O-O .td6 13 .thS!? g6 14 .l:tel 'iitf8 IS.tf3 f6 16 tbc4 .tc7 17 tbc3 'iitg7. d4) 4 tbf3 tbb4 also appears to eliminate a bishop, but S .tc4! escapes, in view of S. .. .txe4 6 .txf7+! 'iitxf7 7 tbgS+ 'iite8 8 tbxe4, etc. So the normal response would be S. .. e6. Now Wind analyses 6 tbc3 (Martin gives only the relatively harmless 6 c3 dS 7 exdS tbxdS, al- though after 8 O-O, his 8 ... tbgf6 allows 9 tbeS!, so 8 ... .td6 is better; 6 'iie2 can be met by

Black could use some improvements here. You might want to compare 4 ... ttJc6 below. Let's return to 3 ... ttJf6. 4 'iie2 (D) White definitely should avoid 4 e5? ~xg2. We shall see 4 ttJd2 in the next game, and 4 ttJc3 e6 transposes to lines covered via 3 ttJc3 below (in the game K.Nikolaidis-Minasian). 4 "ilke2 causes unique problems.
B
4 ... e6 Black has some move-order issues to worry about. He can try 4 ... c5, when 5 c3 e6 heads for the game. If White plays 5 d5 e6 and follows up with 6 c4, Black can reply 6 ... d6 with the idea of ... exd5; for example, 7 f4 exd5 8 cxd5 g6 sets up a sort of Benoni in which neither ... ~b7 nor ~e2 are particularly good moves; this should be perfectly playable for Black. Alternatively, he can try 8 ... ~e7 with the idea ... O-O. White can instead play 6 ttJf3 and transpose to the note to 6 c3 below. The developing move 4 ... ttJc6!? threatens d4 and has the idea of winning White's bishop by ... ttJb4. What is presently the main line runs
5 c3 e5 6 ttJf3 (6 d5 ttJe7 7 ttJf3 ttJg6 8 O-O c6 9
c4 i.c5 with equality due to Black's relatively free piece-play, A.Stein-A.lvanov, Foxwoods 2005) 6 ... exd4 7 e5 ttJd5 8 ~e4!. Then I think 8 ... ttJde7! 9 cxd4 d5 yields attractive counter- play; for example, 10 ~c2 g6 11 ttJc3 ~g7 12 0-00-0 13 a3 (versus ... ttJb4 and ... ~a6) and now 13 ... ~d7 or 13 ... ttJa5. As usual, you have ample opportunity to expand upon such raw material. 5 ttJf3 (D)
B
5 ... c5!? 5 ... d5 6 e5 ttJfd7 introduces variations from the next game, but allows 7 ttJg5. Then Black may stand all right, but has to know very specif- ically what to play; see the notes there. 6c3 White can play 6 d5! here, threatening c4 with a bind. This seems to leave White with the better game; for example, C.Bauer-Minasian, New York 2000 continued 6 ... exd5 7 exd5+ "ilke7 8 c4 b5?! (however, 8 ... 1i'xe2+ 9 ~xe2 d6 10 .l:!.el ~e7 11 ~f1 puts pressure on Black's position) 9 b3 'fi'xe2+ 10 ~xe2 b4 11 .l:!.el d6 12 ~f1 + ~e7 13 ~f4 with space and initia- tive. Black may be able to improve upon this; oth- erwise he might want to use a 3 ... e6 move- order, or look into deviations from the game such as 4 ... ttJc6 or 5 ... d5. 6 ... ~e7 This position too can arise via several move- orders. 70-0 To confuse matters, White can play ttJbd2 from move 3 onwards. At this point, 7 ttJbd2 d5 (7 ... ttJc6 8 a3 is the game) 8 e5 ttJfd7 9 O-O ttJc6 transposes into the next game. 7 ... ttJc6 (D)
98 MASTERING THE CHESS OPENINGS
w Sa3!? Playing this move before ttJbd2 has certain advantages (see the next note). It also has draw- backs, however, in particular the weakening of b3. Instead, S e5 (S dxc5 transposes if, after either recapture by Black, White plays 9 e5) S. .. ttJd5 9 dxc5 has done well for White, but with accurate play, Black's development and central pawns should more or less make up for his structural problems, as follows: a) After 9 ... bxc5 10 c4, Bauer analyses 1O ... ttJb6! 11 ttJc3 O-O 12 ~e4 (12 .Jif4 f5!?) 12 ... g6 13 .Jih6 l:!.eS, which might mildly fa- vour White following 14 ~f4! (14 .lte2 f6!) 14 ... d6 15 l:t.adl, but 15 ... ttJxe5 16 ttJxe5 dxe5 17 ~xe5 iVd4!? keeps things within bounds; for example, IS fIIc7 fIIh4 19 .ltf4 .ltdS! 20 ~xb7 ~xf4 and the opposite-coloured bishops help Black. b) 9 ... .ltxc5 10 b4 i.e7 11 a3 is more inter- esting. White intends c4 and .ltb2 and has more space. Black should challenge his central con- trol by l1...f5! (D). w With his cramped position, Black wants to stake out some kingside territory. 11 ... f5 covers the key e4-square and cuts off White's light- squared bishop from a potential kingside at- tack. Whether this works against White's con- siderable space advantage is another matter; I suspect that Black gets just enough play. The instructive game Rosandic-Filipovic, Zadar 2001 continued 12 c4 (12 exf6?! .ltxf6 and ...

100 MASTERING THE CHESS OPENINGS
Black would like to play ... liJb4 and ... i.a6. Exchanging his bad bishop in this fashion is a major theme in the 'French-Owen', and White usually makes sure to prevent it: 12 a3 i.a6 13 i.bl .l:tc8 14 'ilVd2!? (heading for f4 and g4) 14 ... a4!

'iYb6, in order to attack the d-pawn and prepare ... b4; for example, 17 'Ylif4 h6 18 'iY g4 g6 with ... h5 to follow. In general, the play looks balanced in this line. 4 ... e6 5 liJf3 d5 If Black is heading for ... d5 structures, this is the obvious timing, but not risk-free. We saw 5 ... c5 6 d5! in the notes to the previous game. Again, it may be that Black should prefer a move-order with 3 ... e6 and an early ... c5 if he wants to avoid the problems described in the note to White's 7th move.
6 e5 liJfd7 7 c3
A critical juncture. 7liJg5 (D) is both aggres- sive and logical.

White not only brings the queen to the king- side to create threats, but he frees his f-pawn to advance. liJg5 is another move that pops up re- peatedly in the French Defence, but in that opening Black's attack on the centre or queen- side is already underway.

The most important thing to remember about all lines with ... cxd4 is that Black gives up the option of a later queens ide attack by ... c4. Such attacks tend to be important in these variations, so you need to be sure that ... cxd4 accomplishes something concrete before playing it. 9 ... ~e7 Note that 9 ... c4 10 ~c2 should probably be followed by 1O ... ~e7 anyway, because after 1O ... bS lllbgS!

... g5!? This advance comes up repeatedly in the 'French-Owen', just as it does in the related French Defence positions. Black is not merely launching a kingside attack, but preparing to reorganize his pieces. In particular, ... lbf8-g6 can be surprisingly effective, as in the previous note. Be aware, however, that the correspond- ing attack with ... gS in the French Defence is backed up by moves such as ... 'itVb6, making ... g4 a continual threat to win White's d-pawn. That's not true in the Owen version, so the threat to White's centre is minimal. On the other hand, Black has one significant advantage here: if White plays dxcS, he doesn't gain the d4- square for a piece because Black can reply with ... bxcS. This is all hard to assess, but it's worth noting that the safer 10 ...

White gets his bishop out before blocking it by lDbd2.

The defensive-looking move 3 f3 is remark- ably rare, perhaps because it gives Black too much leeway. I'm going to leave it to the reader to think about, but you should know that 3 ... e6 is normal, when the obvious ... dS soon thereaf- ter has the advantage that if White plays eS, the pawn on f3 will have to move again to f4, both to support eS and to clear f3 for the king's knight. That constitutes a loss of tempo, al- though it has compensating benefits. An inter- esting alternative to ... dS is to combine ... tiJh6 and .. .fS, or ... g6, ... .Bg7 and ... tiJe7, delaying the choice of pawn-breaks. In fact, 3 ... dS!? is also a reasonable reply. Then Black intends to answer 4 tiJc3 with 4 ... e6, which has the posi- tional ideas of ... tiJf6 and ... .Bb4, as well as an opportunistic .. :iih4+ to disturb White's build- up. Versus 4 exdS, Black can play 4 ... ~xdS; e.g., S c4 "it'd7. Finally, the move 4 eS can be logically answered by 4 ... e6 or 4 .. :~d7!?, with an eye towards ... .Ba6 and/or ... cS. 3 ... e6 (D) w When White plays 3 tiJc3, he develops more freely than in lines where he supports his centre with c3 and plays tiJd2. For one thing, his dark-squared bishop doesn't have to wait for the middlegame to come into play. In addition, Black has to be aware that an early ... cS can of- ten be answered by dS, and that in some cases the move ... dS can be favourably countered by exdS. On the flip side, the knight on c3 can be pinned by ... .Bb4, which adds to the pressure on e4 exerted by Black's queen's bishop. Further- more, White's inability to bolster the centre with c3 means that a properly-timed ... cS can create more difficulties than we saw in the pre- vious two games. 4 tiJf3 There are two important alternatives for White here: a) 4.Bd3 (the other move-order is 3 .Bd3 e6 4 tiJc3, which gives Black the option of3 ... tiJf6, as above). Now: al) 4 ... g6 (as used by Spas sky) is a legiti- mate way to play chess and avoid theory; Black often sets up the 'Hippopotamus' formation with ... .Bg7, ... tiJe7, ... d6 and so forth. Not sur- prisingly, most top players will prefer White in that case: he has space, development, and no weaknesses. Nevertheless, several grandmasters have shown that it's not easy to crack Black's position. Black has two more conventional approaches after 4 .Bd3: a2) The straightforward 4 ... tiJf6 can be an- swered by S tiJge2, when Black is faced with the question of how to challenge the centre: S. .. dS!? (S ... cS 6 dS! should become a familiar theme to you; if Black grabs the d-pawn by 6 ... exdS 7 exdS tiJxdS S tiJxdS .ixdS, both 9 tiJf4 ti'e7+ 10 .Be3 and 9 O-O followed by 10 tiJf4 are promis- ing) 6 eS tiJfd7?!

English Defence The English Defence is defined by the moves ... b6 and ... e6 versus White's c4. In the great majority of cases, Black also plays ... .Bb7 and White d4, but occasionally Black plays ... i.a6, and White sometimes foregoes d4 in order to avoid central exposure. In general, I would characterize the English Defence as one of the most exciting and instruc- tive modem fianchetto openings. It embraces an extraordinary number of highly tactical varia- tions, which unfortunately requires a lot of prep- aration from Black (and an unusually detailed exposition on my part). However, most of those tactics grow out of distinctive positional roots. What's more, the hypermodern theme of attack- ing an occupied centre from the flank will sel- dom express itself more clearly.
1 c4 b6 (D)
1...b6 is more popular versus I c4 than I e4
or 1 d4, for reasons that become clear next move. Nevertheless, I should note that 1 d4 e6 is appropriate for a French Defence player, be- cause 2 e4 dS leads to the French Defence itself and 2 c4 b6 brings us back to the English De- fence. The other popular move-order after I c4 is
1.. .e6; for example, 2 d4 b6 transposes to the
main line. 2lLlf3 is an independent move-order that often transposes to another opening; for ex- ample, 2 ... dS (Queen's Gambit or Reti), 2 ... cS (Symmetrical English), 2 .. .fS (Dutch), or vari- ous Indian formations with 2 ... lLlf6 (notice that this kind of transposition isn't possible after I d4 b6 2 e4). w

2d4 The alternative 2ltJf3 il.b7 3 g3 i.xf3 is dis- cussed below, in the notes to Marjanovic-Ivan- isevic. 2 ... e6 Of course, 2 ... il.b7 is playable as well. With 2 ... e6 Black leaves himself ready to play an early ... il.b4. He might also want to hold off on 2 ... il.b7 in order to retain options for the bishop if White plays slowly. For example, 2 ... e6 3ltJf3 ltJf6 is a Queen's Indian Defence, when the modem main lines involve the move ... il.a6. Fur- thermore, the move 3 d5!?, which would directly block off the bishop after 2 ... il.b7, can now be answered by 3 ... il.a6 (4 e4ltJf6!), 3 ... ltJf6 4 a3 (to avoid ... il.b4) 4 ... il.a6, or the bizarre-looking 3 ... iVh4 (hitting c4), whose theoretical reputa- tion is not bad. 3e4 If there's a way for White to get a substantial advantage against the English Defence, this has to be it. Establishing a broad centre conforms with our usual 'stress test' of any black defence that doesn't itself establish a central pawn pres- ence. I should say that the slower approach with
3 a3 i.b7 4 ltJc3 (equivalent to 1 c4 b6 2 d4
i.b7 3ltJc3 e64 a3, with minor move-order is- sues) has been a deterrent to some prospective players of the English Defence, particularly at grandmaster level, because it's easy to fall into a cramped position. Nevertheless, Black has plenty of ways to develop his pieces and will not have to fear being steamrollered by pawns, so the a3 lines are not to be feared in the way that 3 e4 is. I'll take this up in a game below (Sher-Lempert). 3 ••• il.b7 (D) w This position constitutes the starting point for the most frequently-played and most challeng- ing variation of the English Defence. Black is in the strange circumstance that he has a remark- able number of moves at his disposal for each of his early moves, but that they tend to be the same moves: ... il.b4(+), ... 'iVh4(+), ... f5 and ... ltJe7 (or ... ltJf6, normally not before ... f5). Naturally, Black makes other piece moves and pawn-breaks (sometimes the light-squared break ... d5, for example, but rarely ... c5 or ... e5). Nev- ertheless, the basic attacks on White's centre are strangely similar for a move as noncommittal as ... il.b7. The implementation of these moves depends upon White's own set-up, of course, but right at this moment he settles much of the question by his choice, which is usually either 4 il.d3 or 4 ltJc3. White's general strategy is straightfor- ward: support of his centre, development, and a pawn advance. He can play f3 or 'ilVc2 to further the first goal, although the latter move tends to be ineffective. Pressing forward with d5 cuts off Black's bishop on b7, but it uses a valuable tempo and opens up some squares for Black's pieces - see the next note. The prospect of White's d5, however, accounts for the fact that Black seldom commits to ... ltJf6 before ... f5; that is, he wants to have the move ... f5 available to break down White's c4/d5/e4 phalanx. 4 ii.d3 This bishop development is the most impor- tant move, although 4 ltJc3 has been played more often and is discussed in games to follow. The drawback to 4ltJc3 is that it grants Black's dark-squared bishop an immediate and effec- tive role following 4 ... i.b4. By contrast, 4 ii.d3 il.b4+ lets White avoid doubled pawns by 5 il.d2 and can even speed his development; 4 ... ii.b4+ is a rare choice for Black, but a legiti- mate one with its own ideas, and we'll cover it in the next game. Some lesser continuations: a) 4 d5 has more than one good reply, but an attractive one is 4 ... ltJf6, recommended by Langrock, because Black takes the initiative. Then 5 e5?! ltJe4 threatens ... il.b4+ and ... ii.c5, and 5 il.d3 exd5 6 exd5 c6 or 6 cxd5 c6 is easy for Black to play. That leaves 5 ltJc3 il.b4 6 il.d3, which may even leave White in the worse position: 6 ... exd5 7 cxd5 (7 exd5 c6 8 dxc6!?

Since 6 ttJf3 ~g4 attacks g2 as well, and 6 dS ttJb4 7 ~e2 ttJf6 8 eS ttJg4 is a double attack on f2 and eS, only 6 g3 ~f6 7 dS seems playable, until you find that 7 ... ttJb4 8 ~e2 'iVd4! 9 .Bc2 .Ba6! wins.

Because playing in this manner is so risky for Black, it seems better - or at least more practical- to play 6 ... ~ g4, hitting the g-pawn immediately: 7 ~fl (7 g3 fS 8 f3 'iVhS) 7 .. .fS 8 f3 (8 ttJgf3 .Bxd2 9 .Bxd2?? fxe4 10 ttJeS 'iVxg2+!; 8 h3 ~g6 is difficult to assess or work out) 8 ... ~h4 9 exfS, Levitt-Ehlvest, New York 1994, and here 9 ... ttJc6! 10 fxe6 dxe6 gives Black at least adequate compensation according to separate analyses by Levitt and Odessky. c) 4 f3 can be answered by the typically dy- namic 4 ... fS! S exfS ttJh6! (this resembles 4 ttJc3 .Bb4 S f3 fS 6 exfS ttJh6! below), a gam- bit based upon 6 fxe6 ttJfS! with an attack. In- stead, 6 .Bxh6 'iVh4+ 7 g3 'iWxh6 wins the dark squares; for example, 8 fxe6 .Bb4+ 9 ~f2 O-O with a strong initiative. After 4 .Bd3, Black's main replies are 4 .. .fS and 4 ... ttJc6.

This leads to wild and forcing play. We'll see 4 ... .Bb4+ in the next game. Periodically writers recommend 4 ...

White is about to be a rook down for two pawns, in return for obvi- ous attacking chances against Black's loose king. This extraordinarily tactical line has long been a theoretician's nightmare, and I'll try to show a complete solution with a minimum of details. 9liJe2! White develops and forces Black to capture on hI; this knight will head for f4. I won't go into the details about 9 hxg8'Yi'+?! ~xg8, but Black's activity gives him at least equality. 9 i.g5 is sometimes regarded as more accu- rate than 9liJe2, often transposing after 9 ... liJf6 10 'iVh4 .i.xh 1 11 liJe2. In fact, this was the ac- tual move-order Browne used in the game. In- stead, 11 liJd2 prevents the tricky move ... .i.f3 that we see below. But 11 liJd2 in tum forfeits the opportunity for liJc3 at some point, which contributes to White's victory in our main game. Fortunately (for simplicity's sake), it turns out (at least in my opinion) that Black is essentially lost after either 11 liJe2 or 11 liJd2, and that 9 i.g5 is therefore just as strong as 9liJe2. A key transposition to lines below is l1liJd2 'iie7 12 liJe2 i¥f7 13liJf4 (13 O-O-O isn't as good due to 13 ... liJxh7!). 9 ••. .i.xhll0 i.gSliJf611 'iih4 (D)

The much less radical 4 ... i.b4+ is played fairly often, although it doesn't immediately break up White's centre after 5 .Jtd2 (D) (in- stead of 5 ttJc3, which we'll see later by trans- position). White seems to have a small, conventional advantage; however, there's much that remains

to be discovered here, as in any such ultra- flexible line: a) 5 ... iLxd2+ 6 ~xd2 (or 6 ttJxd2 with the idea 6 ... 'ii'g5?! 7 ttJgf3!, and after the consistent 7 .. :~xg2?!, White establishes a meaningful lead in active development following 8 l:!.gl ~h3 9 'uxg7 ~h6 10 ~g3; 6 ... ttJh6 improves, and I'd assess White as marginally better for classical reasons, but modernists may wish to dispute that) 6 ... ttJh6 (6 .. .f5 7 ttJc3 ttJf6 falls slightly short of equality following 8 f3 ttJc6 9 exf5!? ttJxd4 10 ~e3 c5 11 ttJge2 ttJxe2 12 ttJxe2; for example, 12 ... O-O 13 fxe6 :le8 14 ttJf4 or 12 ... 'ii'e7 13 fxe6 with the idea 13 ... O-O 140-0 dxe6 15 'iVe5) 7 ttJc3 f5 8 ttJf3 O-O and now both
9 O-O and 9 O-O-O favour White.
b) 5 ... ttJc6 has the point that 6 iLxb4 ttJxb4 will force the exchange of White's bishop on d3. But in the first place, 6 ttJf3 should give White some pull; for example, he stood better after the forthright 6 ... ~f6 7 d5 .Jtxd2+ 8'ii'xd2 in Dautov-Speelman, Lippstadt 2000. And has Black gained anything from 5 ... ttJc6 if White plays 6 ttJe2? For example, 6 ... 'iYf6 (6 ... .Jtxd2+ 7 'iWxd2 'iYf6 8 d5 ttJe5 9 O-O) 7 .Jtxb4 ttJxb4 8 ttJbc3 and 8 ... ttJxd3+ is a slightly improved version for White of the main line, whereas 8 ... ttJe7 9 .Jtbl!? O-O 10 a3 ttJbc6 11 O-O looks promising. I should emphasize that both sides have tried other moves in the lines following 4 ... .Jtb4+, and although I lean towards White, it's not clear that Black can't keep things approximately level ifhe employs the proper move-order and strategy. 5 exf5 .Jtb4+ In this manner, Black manages to steer clear of White's terrifying attack in the previous

game, and initiate some aggression of his own. But he'll have to give up some material to do that. 6'iWl (D) White protects his g-pawn. It's easy to con- firm that if White interposes a piece, say, 6 .ltd2?, Black can exchange and play 7 ... .ltxg2. Then 8 'iVh5+ is wholly insufficient because of 8 ... ~f8.

6 ..• lbf6 Apparently Black has to sacrifice at least a pawn to keep things moving: a) 6 ... exf5? is positionally disastrous: 7 c5!?

This is a fa- vourite way to treat the position today, and seems to give White a small edge. But in order to truly punish this system, you need to enter into a riskier bargain. And it's another of those times that positional understanding gives way to loads of concrete analysis: a) 7 c5 bxc5 8 a3 is a radical and well-tested line. It is utterly chaotic in a number of varia- tions, but should favour White if he's careful. I'll show a couple of important lines, then let you research on your own: 8 ... c4!

This move looks rather silly until you realize that if White defends his d-pawn with a piece, 5 ... ttJb4 exchanges his bishop on d3 and wins the bishop-pair. On the other hand, this leaves White with a clear lead in space and develop- ment. In other words, a typical opening trade- off. 5 ttJf3 This is often considered inferior to 5 ttJe2 (see the following game), because it blocks the f-pawn. Still, White has more central control and decent chances for a pull. a) A clever suggestion (of what origin I'm unsure) is 5 i..e2!?, protecting d4 with the queen and avoiding the exchange of the king's bishop. Then anything goes; for example, 5 ... ttJa5!? hits e4, an attack that can be fortified by ... 'iih4 and/or ... ttJf6, while .. .f5 can be a theme. b) After 5 d5 ttJe5 6 i..e2?

It's useful to compare this to the Hedgehog Variation of the English Opening and similar formations in the Sicilian Defence. In fact, all the differences favour White. First, his bad light-squared bishop is gone, which is a huge plus. Then he is ahead in development in com- parison with those variations, and his queen on g3 is beautifully placed. Finally, Black's pawn on d6 is much weaker than usual. The game continued 16 ... g6 (Epishin analyses the depress- ing alternative 16 ...

The most investigated lines in the English Defence (although no longer the most impor- tant) begin with 4 tbc3, about which a fair-sized book could be written. I'll make the not-so- bold claim that Black's play is adequate in ev- ery line, and therefore show only one full-game example. However, because this variation is so thoroughly dependent upon specifics, you might want to supplement this coverage with other books and database searches, particularly if the English Defence becomes one of your primary weapons.

1 c4 b6 2 d4 e6 3 e4 ~b7 4 liJc3 ~b4 (D)
The funny thing about this position is that White goes into it more than any other, and yet it is the easiest for Black to play and the most difficult for White to defend. The trade-off of liJc3 for ... ~b4 seems to favour Black, since ... ~b4 clears the way for ... f5 (with f8 free for the king, White's exf5 and 'iih5+ attack is no longer strong), and brings Black closer to cas- tling. In the meantime, White's knight on c3 doesn't add to the defence of e4, and is subject to capture with the attendant doubled-pawn issues. It's worth comparing this with the Nimzo- Indian Defence, in which Black plays the same move with the idea of controlling and some- times occupying e4. The biggest difference is that in the Nimzo-Indian, White has no pawn on that square to defend, and thus needn't tie his pieces to it. In the English Defence, White has to scramble to ward off the direct attack on e4 and can't find time to pursue other goals. 5~d3 This is the most-frequently played move by some margin. Here are the major alternatives; notice how many traps White has to be wary of: a) 5 'iVc2 was popular when the English De- fence was first played, but the primitive attack 5 ... 'iih4 ! (D), hitting the e-pawn and preventing its defence by f3, caused it to fade from the scene. The tactics are entertaining: al) 6 ~d3 f5 7 g3 'iVh5 (7 ... 'iie7!?) 8 f3 liJc6!? forces White to do something about d4, w and the natural 9 ~e3?! fxe4 10 ~xe4 liJf6 leaves Black with the better of it. a2) 6 d5!? isn't as bad as it has been made out to be, but Black should equalize after 6 ... ~xc3+ (6 .. .f5!? 7 exf5 exd5 8 liJf3 'iie4+ 9 ~dl! ~xc2+ 10 ~xc2) 7 bxc3 f5 (7 ... 'iie7!?) 8 exf5 exd5 9 cxd5 ~xd5 10 liJe2 liJe7. b) 5 d5 is well answered by 5 ... 'iVe7! 6 ~e3 (6 liJe2 exd5 7 exd5 liJf6; 6 ~e2 liJf6 7 f3 exd5 8 cxd5 c6 9 dxc6 liJxc6 10 liJh3 d5 11 exd5 O-O-O with more than enough attack) 6 ... f5! 7 exf5 exd5 8 cxd5 (8 'ilVh5+ ~f8) 8 ... liJf6, win- ning back material with the initiative; the key line is 9 ~c4 'ilVe4! 10 'iUe2 ~xg2 11 ~d4+ 'it>d8. c) 5 f3 is White's most important alternative to 5 ~d3; it serves both to strengthen White's centre and to reduce the effect of Black's bishop on b7. There's nothing wrong with 5 ... liJe7 (in- tending .. .f5 or in some cases ... d5), but the most aggressive reply is 5 .. .f5 6 exf5 liJh6! (a gambit, with the idea ... liJ(x)f5, which in tum threatens ... 'iVh4+ and the pawn on d4; 6 ... exf5 is also playable, if duller) and now: c1) 7 ~xh6 'Yi'h4+ 8 g3 'ii'xh6 gains the bishop-pair with pressure on the dark squares like e3 and d4; for example, 9 'Yi'd2 'iUxd2+ 10 ~xd2 liJc6! 11 liJge2 (Heimberger-Teske, Linz 1995) and now Odessky suggests 11...O-O-O with the idea 12 fxe6 dxe6 13 ~e3 liJxd4! 14 liJxd4 ~c5. c2) After 7 fxe6 liJf5 the highly-charged main line runs 8 ~f4! (to counter ... 'ii'h4+; 8 exd7+ is not necessarily unplayable, but hardly anyone will want to fall so far behind in devel- opment after 8 ... liJxd7) 8 ... dxe6 9 'Yi'a4+ liJc6

As mentioned in the first game of my cover- age of the English Defence, some players are discouraged by the lack of prospects for Black after these moves, although the evidence is mixed in that regard. White's idea is to play dS, gaining space while limiting the range of Black's bishop. It's easy to see that allowing Black to play ... ii.b4 robs that advance of its effectiveness by making the dS-pawn a target; hence the pre- liminary a3. For his part, Black can argue that a3 does little in lines where Black plays ... g6, and indeed, 4 ... g6 is a popular way of returning the game to a long-term struggle between White's space and Black's attempts to chip away at the centre. In this context, I should mention that with the move-order I c4 b6 2 d4 e6 3 a3, Black will sometimes play 3 ... g6 and 4 ... ii.g7, delay- ing the development of his queen's bishop, which may end up on a6 or elsewhere.
MODERN QUEENSIDE FIANCHE1TO 121
I suspect that White retains some theoretical advantage in the ... g6 set-up, which probably doesn't mean much in practice. Here's a game which illustrates a more confrontational strat- egy by Black: Sher - Lempert Erevan open 1996

Theory shuttles back and forth between verdicts of equality and a modest ad- vantage for White. The main appeal of 3 a3 is that it steers clear of the dramatic counterat- tacks that Black can play versus 3 e4. For his part, Black will have a relatively safe position, but he will often have to be satisfied with oper- ating from a position with less space and fewer tactical possibilities. You'll find that positional skill is at a premium in these lines. Finally, White can head for many other set- ups if he plays 2 lbc3 or 2 lbf3, as seen in the following game: Marjanovic - Ivanisevic Yugoslav Ch, Subotica 2000
1 c4 b6 2lbc3
Upon 2lbf3 iLb7, Black can always opt for a Queen's Indian set-up with ... e6 and ... lbf6, or enter into a Symmetrical English with ... cS. However, he has an important alternative plan when White plays g3 on this or the following move: a) 3 g3 (this is equivalent to 2 g3 iLb7 3 lbf3) and now 3 ... iLxf3!? 4 exf3 cedes the bishop-pair for positional compensation. Black usually continues with 4 ... cS (D) (he can also play 4 ... e6, with ... c6 and ... dS to come). w I won't go into the very lengthy details, but 3 ... .i.xf3 can be a good psychological weapon because it interferes with White's common in- tention to playa 'simple' English set-up with g3, iLg2, lbc3 and e3 or e4. The advantage of 4 ... cS is that it controls the weak point on d4. In response, White can develop by some combina- tion of lbc3, .i.g2 and O-O, but in doing so, he allows Black to fortify his grip on d4 and gain a strong outpost there by, for example, ... lbc6, ... g6 and ... iLg7. Since that is highly unattrac- tive, White almost always plays 5 d4!. Now S. .. cxd4 6 ~xd4lbc6 transposes to line 'b', or something very similar, but Black has the op- tion of S. .. lbc6!?, a provocative attempt to con- test d4 directly. Play usually goes 6 dS lbd4 7 iLe3lbfS. While White has tried several moves here, Black seems to equalize versus all of them, including the most frequently-seen 8 iLd2 g69 iLc3 .i.g7 10 iLxg7 lbxg7; for example, Knott-Summerscale, British Ch, Millfield 2000 went 11 iLh3 lbh6 12 O-O lbhfS 13 lba3 lbd4 14 lbc2 lbgfS IS lbe3 lbd6! 16 f4 O-O 17 b4 WIIc7 18 a4 fS 19l:ta3lbe4 20 .l:i.d3 eS with a fine position for Black. b) 3lbc3 (this is thought to be more precise than 3 g3) 3 ... e6 4 g3 .i.xf3!? (again, conceding a bishop to gain more control over d4; 4 ... lbf6 S .i.g2 cS would transpose into one of the Hedge- hog lines of the English Opening - see Volume 3) S exf3 cS 6 d4! cxd4 (this time 6 ... lbc6 7 dS lbd4 is regarded as inferior after 8 iLe3 lbfS 9 iLh3!) 7 ~xd4 lbc6 8 'ilfdl .uc8 (D) (not the only move, but it indirectly targets the c4-pawn).
124 MASTERING THE CHESS OPENINGS
w Again we have a case of White having the bishop-pair and open e- and d-files, which offset his weaknesses (the doubled f-pawns and the central squares d3 and d4). Play can continue 9 .i.f4!? .i.M 10 ':c1 tDge7 11 a3 .i.xc3+ 12 .l::txc3, as in Fridman-Mainka, Recklinghausen

White himself may wish to take advantage of the benefits of a queenside fianchetto by play- ing 1 b3, sometimes known as Larsen's Open- ing, or the Nimzowitsch-Larsen Attack. As I've mentioned, the top-level players use this move relatively infrequently, because Black has con- servative set-ups which neutralize White's pos- sibilities. Nevertheless, we'll look at a few of
126 MASTERING THE CHESS OPENINGS
B
the more lively lines, with a couple of games that illustrate the paradoxes inherent in reversed positions. But first, let's walk through some initial moves.
1. .. e5
If Black can play this most cooperative of moves and get away with it, especially in con- junction with ... d5, that's not a good sign for White's ambitions as a whole. We'll test that theory in a couple of games. But first, let me de- scribe, without serious analysis, just a few of the many other ways that play can develop, with an emphasis on themes that cross over from opening to opening: a) 1...ttJf6 2 .i.b2 g6 (not the only move, of course) 3 .i.xf6!? (most other moves allow a comfortable King's Indian position following ... .i.g7, ... O-O and ... d6) 3 ... exf6 4 c4 (D).
B
Compare this position with the English De- fence variation I c4 b6 2 ttJf3 .i.b7 3 ttJc3 .i.xf3 4 exf3 c5! from the previous section. In that case, Black had a more interesting game than White does here, because d4 was a weakness and White had some looseness in his position. This happened because of White's move c4, whereas ... c5 isn't present in our reversed line. I should also mention that I b3 c5 2 .i.b2 ttJf6 3 c4 g6?! (more commonly arrived at via I c4 c5
2 b3 ttJf6 3 .i.b2 g6?!) 4 .i.xf6! exf6 5 ttJc3 fol-
lowed by g3 and .i.g2 combines the best of both worlds for White, because Black cannot carry out ... d5. Anyway, in the diagram position after 4 c4 (in the I b3 version), White's position is sound enough. Nevertheless, Black has no serious weaknesses, and can develop naturally by .. .f5 and ... .i.g7 or even win space by 4 ... d5!? 5 cxd5 'iVxd5 6 ttJc3 'iVa5, as played successfully in several contests. b) 1...c5 2 .i.b2 ttJc6 (D) and now: w bI) 3 ttJf3 d64 d4 (otherwise 4 ... e5) 4 ... cxd4 5 ttJxd4 .i.d7 and now 6 g3?! permits the ad- vance 6 ... e5! with the idea 7 ttJb5 ~a5+ 8 ttJIc3 d5! 9 'iVxd5 .l:.d8 and White is in trouble, be- cause ... .i.e6 and ... a6 is threatened. That illus- trates the danger of permitting your opponent a central majority. b2) 3 e3 d6 (3 ... e5 4 .i.b5 ttJge7 and 3 ... ttJf6 are also options) 4 ttJe2 (Odessky's recommen- dation, rather than 4 d4 cxd4 5 exd4 d5!) 4 ... e5 (after 4 ... ttJf6 5 d4 cxd4 6 ttJxd4 e5 or 6 ... g6, Black has few problems and his central major- ity may come into play) 5 d4. Now 5 ... cxd4 6 exd4 'iVa5+!? with the idea 7 .i.c3 ~d5 is one route. Another is 5 ... exd4 6 exd4 ttJf6!, since 7 d5 ttJb4 followed by ... .i.f5 and sometimes ... 'iVa5100ks good, but so does 7 dxc5 d5!, with the kind of isolated pawn position in which
MODERN QUEENSIDE FIANCHEITO 127
Black's activity is at least sufficient for equal- ity. c) l...dS 2 .i.b2 has another large complex of possibilities attached to it; we shall examine just a couple. White would often like to see something along the lines of 2 ... cS!? 3 e3 (3 lZ'lf3?! f6! is a famous positional trick, when Black achieves ... eS; then 4 d4?! is a poor re- sponse in view of 4 ... cxd4 followed by ... eS) 3 ... lZ'lc6 4 .i.bS, with a reversed English De- fence a tempo up in which he reserves the op- tions of lZ'lf3, lZ'le2 and/or f4. After 2 ... cS, we often get positions resembling those of the Nimzo-Indian and Queen's Indian Defences. Of course, 2 ... lZ'lf6 is safe and sound, as is 2 ... .i.fS; play may enter the realm of the Reti Opening if White combines g3 and c4. Another popular defence begins with 2 ... .i.g4!?, trying to get the bishop out in front of the pawn-chain following ... e6. This can go in many directions, such as 3 g3 c64 .i.g2lZ'lf6 SlZ'lf3, when S ... e6 6 O-O lZ'lbd7 7 c4 leads to a Reti Opening, with an optional d4. But Black can also play independ- ently for ... eS; for example, S. .. lZ'lbd7 6 O-O (6 d4) 6 ... .i.xf3!? 7 .i.xf3 eS. Finally, Odes sky analyses the rare gambit 3 f3 with the idea e4; for example, 3 ... .i.hS 4 e4 dxe4 S ~e2! threat- ening to win a piece with 6 ~bS+. Apparently this was even played by Kasparov! Let's return to 1...eS (D): w 2 .i.b2lZ'lc6 Naturally, 2 ... d6 can't be bad; then 3 e3lZ'lf6
4 c4 (4 d4 exd4 and after S exd4 dS White's

3 c4 is of course possible; it is an English

al) Here I think that 6 ... g6! has been under- rated. White is supposed to gain the upper hand by 7 i.bS i.g7 8 lZ'lf3, putting direct pressure on eS and c6. A few games have proceeded 8 ... i.g4, when both 9 'iVc2 and 9 h3 favour White. But here the pseudo-sacrifice 8 ... O-O! turns things around; for example, 9 .i.xc6 bxc6 10 lZ'lxeS (10 i.xeS .i.xeS 11 lZ'lxeS "V$ gS 12lZ'lf3 'iVxg2 13 J:tgl 'iVh3 14 J:tg3 ~d7 IS ~c2 J::te8 and White's light squares are weak) 1O ... ~gS lllZ'lf3 'fixg2 12l:.g1 'iVh3 13 .i.xg7 <3;;xg7 14 lIg3 'fifS, and the combination of ... .i.a6 and ... l:.fe8 causes White difficulties. a2) The main line goes 6 ... .i.d6 7 'iVc2 O-O 8 lZ'lf3 'fiIe7 9 d3 fS 10 lZ'lbd2 <3;;h8!? (10 ... .i.d7 11 .i.e2l:.ae8) 11 .i.e2 .i.d7, and here instead of 12 O-O .l:.ae8, Odes sky recommends 12lZ'lc4 with a kind of dynamic eqUality. Some players will enjoy this Sicilian Defence structure as White. b) 4 .i.bS .i.d6!?

(Odessky suggests 9 d3 d5 10 ttJd2) 9 ... d5 10 ttJe5 'iVd6?! (1O .. :~e8! with the idea ... i.d6 may produce some advantage) 11 f4! ttJe8, and now 12 c4! with the idea 12 ... f6?! 13 c5! 'i:l¥xc5 14.l:'tc 1 would favour White slightly. Let's return to 3 ... d5 (D): w Here we have the Owen Defence Reversed, surely a position in which White can play for advantage. Of course, as with many reversed openings, you'll find that White's extra move will sometimes tip Black off to the appropriate defence. For a more thorough discussion of this phenomenon, see Chapter 6. 4i.b5 This pin is consistent with everything we learned from the Owen. If White is reduced to 4 c4 d4 (4 ... ttJf6 5 cxd5 ttJxd5 is a playable Re- versed Sicilian), then he's admitting to having achieved nothing with 1 b3. And 4 ttJf3 can be met by 4 ... f6, or simply 4 ... e4 5 ttJd4 ttJxd4 6 i.xd4 a6!? (versus i.b5+, which would follow if Black played 6 ... c5) 7 d3 (7 i.e2 'iVg5!) 7 ... c5 8 i.b2 ttJf6 9 i.e2 i.e7 10 O-O O-O, with even chances.
4. •. i.d6 5 f4
This is certainly the usual continuation in both the Owen and English Defences: when the f-pawn can't be captured, it makes sense to use it to break up the opposing centre. If Black de- fends e5 with pieces, then an exchange on e5 establishes a central majority. However, with the advance f4 come some problems, namely, a lack of development and exposure of the king- side, so it's worth noting that White has several less critical and less explored moves: a) 5 ttJf3 f6 6 c4 (6 d4!? is interesting; for example, 6 ... e4 7 ttJfd2 f5 8 ttJc4!? with the idea 8 ... dxc4 9 d5) 6 ... a6 7 cxd5?! (7 i.xc6+ bxc6 8 ttJc3) 7 ... axb5 8 dxc6 bxc6 with the bishop-pair and good central control. b) 5 ttJe2 ttJe7 6 O-O O-O 7 f4 i.e6 8 ttJbc3 f6 and both sides have plenty of play. In fact, 5 ttJe2 would be a good starting point for your in- vestigations. c) 5 c4 dxc4 (or 5 ... ttJe7) 6 bxc4 (6 i.xc4 'iUg5!? 7 ttJf3 ~g6 is an interesting set-up) 6 ... i.d7!? (6 ... ttJe7 is also logical and sound) 7 ttJf3 ttJb4!? (a remarkable move that seems to work; Palliser disapproves of 7 ... 'iUe7 8 c5! i.xc5 9 i.xc6 i.xc6 10 ttJxe5, when White has a central majority, but Black has a bishop-pair after 1O ... i.d5 and this really isn't much) 8 i.xd7+ 'i'xd7 9 O-O ttJd3! 10 'iUb3 ttJc5 and the exciting 11 'iVc2 e4! 12 i.xg7? exf3! gave Black a superb attack in Van Arkel-Posch, COIT. 1987. Instead, 11 'i'c3 needs to be tested, to which the best response is again 11...e4!, when a long forcing line would be 12 ttJe5! (12 'i'xg7 exf3 13 'iUxh8 O-O-O gives obvious compensation)

White seeks to weaken Black's kingside and at the same time soften up the al-h8 diagonal. However, this is not necessarily his best course: a) 6 fxeS?! fxeS 7 iLxc6+ bxc6 8 iLxeS?? is a blunder: 8 .. :~h4+ (8 ... iLxeS 9 ~hS+) 9 g3 'iVe4 10 iLxg7 ~xhl!

w Black's doubled c-pawns and isolated a-pawn. White's f-file is useful in that regard, with ideas such as l:!f4-a4 in waiting.

In the game, Black won only after further mistakes. This chapter has featured far more concrete analysis than has been customary in these vol- umes. If you have the patience to wade through it, however, you'll be pleasantly surprised with how much fun the variations are, as well as gaining new systems to use in your games.
5 Gambits
First, what is a gambit? In the broadest terms, it's the sacrifice of a pawn or two in the open- ing. Sometimes a piece sacrifice is also called a 'Gambit' (e.g., the Cochrane Gambit in the Petroff: 1 e4 e5 2lbf3 lbf6 3lbxe5 d6 4lbxf7), but I think that it's most accurate to restrict the term to pawn sacrifices, and to ones that arise in the early stages of the opening. Of course, there's a hazy line here between 'early stages' and later ones. In the Marshall Attack of the Ruy Lopez, for example, Black doesn't give up a pawn until his 8th move. Some might con- sider that more of a pawn sacrifice than a gam- bit. The distinction isn't important in that case; however, if you look at a long list of named gambits, you'll see that they almost all sacrifice a pawn within the first five moves, and very of- ten on the second or third move. Up to this point in the series, we haven't dealt with a great many gambits. To some extent, that's because they tend to be lacking in the standard themes that I've emphasized through- out. For example, we usually won't see much similarity in pawn-structures between a partic- ular gambit opening and the more conventional openings that we are used to. Nevertheless, when taken as a set, gambits share fundamental characteristics. We shall see, for instance, that almost every gambit emphasizes free piece- play. In addition, most gambits are designed to control the centre, whether by the influence of pieces or by a superior pawn presence. In gam- bits which depend upon early attacks, that cen- tral advantage is often cashed in for tactical gains; in positional gambits, it tends to persist for a while. Oddly enough, there are two fun- damentally opposed techniques by which a gambiteer tries to take charge of the middle of the board. In some gambits, a flank pawn is sacrificed for the opponent's central pawn, thus establishing a central majority. In others, para- doxically, the gambiteer sacrifices his centre pawns for the sake of rapid piece development, and then uses those pieces to control the central squares. Both approaches are perfectly legiti- mate; I'll talk further about this distinction be- low. What about the person on the other side of the board, who is charged with defending against a gambit? What techniques are avail- able to him? Broadly speaking, there are two basic approaches. Some players are happy to grab a pawn or two; they find that their extra material makes up for some temporary discom- fort, and fully expect the pressure to abate after they play some accurate defensive moves. Other players, however, don't want the bother of de- fending against an attack, or of suffering under positional constraints, so they'll decline many or all gambits. Similarly, some will accept the gambit pawn(s), but then return them soon thereafter, in order to catch up in development or improve the central situation. In fact, there are gambits that have disappeared from ordi- nary practice because declining or returning the material proves so effective. In any case, all three of these methods of defence are justified in the appropriate situations. How important are gambits? Because of their rarity at the highest levels, it's easy to underes- timate their influence and utility. For each gam- bit mentioned in this chapter there corresponds one or more books, and/or sections of books, devoted to its investigation, along with articles and masses of master games. With a few ex- ceptions, in fact, I can't possibly present a sig- nificant percentage of the theoretical details behind these openings because there is so much material. But I shall try to outline the most im- portant variations and subvariations, along with what I think are the most critical defences. More importantly, I want to describe the basic ideas behind selected gambits, and point out their positive and negative qualities. It's true that some gambits are of dubious or marginal worth if the opponent knows how to defend precisely. But others are perfectly sound, and your chess education will be seriously lacking
134 MASTERING THE CHESS OPENINGS
without exposure to this unique opening form. In that context, the words of Grandmaster Alex Yermolinsky are enlightening: "From the early days of my development as a chess-player I hated gambit play ... I just couldn't accept this as chess ... All classic gam- bits seemed to lead to the same scenario: White (in most cases, but sometimes it can be Black- anyway, a gambiteer) has to rush things up, has to try to transform his short-lived initiative into an attack against the black king. If it works out, he wins a beautiful game ... if not - I don't know, those games never seem to get published - maybe he loses? "Looking back I realize now, things were not so simple. My stubborn refusal to accept gambit playas an important part of chess strategy inevi- tably caused me to miss something. I missed a chance to learn how to play wide open posi- tions, when your pieces seem to be hanging in the air, and there are maybe 2-3 moves given to you to create something, before they get ex- changed or driven back. The hard work I had to put up to overcome this case of arrested devel- opment ... could have been easily avoided if I had given myself a little practice in my younger days." In what follows, I've looked at a few gambits in more detail than they would seem to merit from their frequency of use. That's because, in contrast with positional openings, the precise move chosen in a gambit is often the difference between life and death. Interestingly, it's some- times easier to discover original ways of play- ing .gambit openings, and defending against them, than it is to come up with new ideas in openings which are, at least superficially, under fewer constraints. I think that's mainly because gambits haven't undergone as thorough a reap- praisal with the assistance of computers as have a number of the more mainstream openings. It turns out that there are numerous flaws in the analysis which has been handed down from au- thor to author over the years, which is all the more reason to take an interest in this area. Primitive Gambits One large group of gambits consists of straight- forward attacking enterprises. Here structural issues and long-term gains are of considerably less concern than the immediate success of di- rect assault. Most of the time, this means that the gambiteer sacrifices a centre pawn for rapid development and open lines. I don't use the word 'primitive' in a derogatory sense; after all, direct attack can be very effective. Let's see some examples, starting with those classic gam- bits that Yermolinsky was referring to: Danish and Goring Gambits Many of the oldest gambits begin with 1 e4 e5, which is logical in view of the fact that 1 e4 is already the fastest developing move, and 1...e5 one of the most committal replies. The Danish Gambit is a fascinating attempt to jump all over Black from the outset, and you can certainly use it to play for a win, especially against oppo- nents within your own rating range or some- what higher. It's not the kind of opening to play casually, however; without a fair amount of study, there a risk that you either won't recover your material or that there will be an unfavour- able simplification. Fortunately, the positional and tactical ideas are great fun to go over, so you'll find yourself easily motivated. Linden - Maczuski Paris 1863
1 e4 e5 2 d4
This move-order doesn't necessarily indi- cate that White wants to playa Danish Gambit, but it avoids the need to study openings begin- ning with 2 ttJf3like 2 ... d6 and 2 ... ttJf6. For ex- ample, the Goring Gambit begins 2 ttJf3 ttJc6 3 d4 exd4 4 c3 dxc3 5 ttJxc3, yet 2 d4 exd4 3 c3 dxc3 4 ttJxc3 will often come to the same thing. See the note to 4 i..c4 below. 2 ... exd4 3 c3 (D) With this move White makes it a gambit. 3 ttJf3 ttJc6 (other moves could be investigated) 4 ttJxd4 is a Scotch Game where White has by- passed the main-line Petroff. 3 'iVxd4 (the Cen- tre Game), while by no means bad, loses time after 3 ... ttJc6. For the consequences, I'll refer you to the standard theoretical sources. After 3 c3, White plans to sacrifice pawns in return for open lines and a direct attack on Black's king. Before getting into the details in

the next few notes, it's worth playing over the main game itself in order to get a feel for this fundamental idea. 3 ... dxc3 Most gambits can be declined, and at this juncture Black has several instructive ways to do so; for example: a) 3 ... d5 4 exd5 Wixd5 5 cxd4 ttJc6 6 ttJf3 (perhaps the best way to keep the queens on is 6 i.e3, which Nigel Davies argues is more likely to produce complications; for example, an orig- inal piece placement arises after 6 ... ttJf6 7 ttJc3 i.b4 S ttJe2!?, intending a3; then the most criti- cal line is S. .. i.g4!? 9 h3!?, introducing another pawn sacrifice: 9 ... i.xe2 10 ..txe2 ~xg2 11 i.f3 Wig6 12 Wib3 followed by O-O-O, as sug- gested by Voigt and MUller) 6 ... ..tg4 7 ttJc3 ..tb4 S ..te2 (D).

Oddly enough, it can also come up in the Chigorin Defence to the Queen's Gambit De- clined! That is, from 1 d4 d5 2 c4 ttJc6 3 ttJf3 ..tg4 4 e3 e5 5 cxd5 ~xd5 6 ttJc3 ..tb4 7 ..te2 exd4 S exd4. At any rate, the best-known solution was played by Capablanca: S. .. ..txf3 9 .txf3 ~c4, when White can't castle and c3 hangs, so he needs to commit: al) 10 ~b3 ~xb3 and now 11 ..txc6+ bxc6 12 axb3 transposes to the 10 ..txc6+ bxc6 11 'iYb3 line, while 11 axb3 ttJge7 has proven solid for Black in many games. a2) Marshall-Capablanca, Lake Hopatcong 1926 went 10 ..te3!? ..txc3+ (Black can also play 10 ...

It's hard for either side to make real progress. Nevertheless, several positions along the way can be played for a win with either colour. b) 3 ... ttJe7 isn't played much, because Black seems to be cutting off his own pieces (the queen and fS-bishop). However, he wants to continue ... d5 and gain access to key light squares after White advances the e-pawn. A knight on the more natural square f6 would be subject to tempo-gaining e5 attacks. After 4 cxd4 d5 (D), White has to decide what to do about his e-pawn. w

One example out of many is S eS (S exdS ltJxdS leaves Black with the ideal blockade of White's isolated queen's pawn, and faster de- velopment to boot; S ltJc3 dxe4 6 ~c4!? has been suggested, when 6 ... ltJfS! 7 ltJge2 ltJd6 looks like a good reply) S ... ltJfS (a well-posted knight; Black can also play S. .. cS 6ltJf3 ltJec6 with pressure on White's centre) 6ltJc3 ~e7!? (6 ... ~b4 is more aggressive, with the idea of tar- geting White's d-pawn in a line like 7ltJf3 O-O 8 ~e2 ltJc6 9 a3 ~a5 10 O-O ~b6 11 ~e3 ~e6 and .. .f6, with chances for both sides) 7 ltJf3 O-O 8 ~d3ltJc6 9ltJe2 (here 9 ~c2! has kingside at- tacking designs) 9 .. .f6 10 a3?

Both sides have numerous ways to generate play in this line. Compare 2ltJf3 ltJc6 3 d4 exd4 4 c3 ltJge7 in the next game. c) 3 ... d3 removes some of the dynamism from the position, but it's a bit passive and there's a whole game ahead after 4 ~xd3ltJc6 (4 ... dS S 'iVe2 dxe4 6 .1i.xe4 ~e7 7 ltJf3 ltJf6 8 .1i.c2 O-O 9 O-O) S ltJf3 d6 6 O-O (or 6 i.c4!? ltJf6
7 O-O), when White has better central control.
d) I should mention that 3 ... ltJf6 4 eSltJe4 is very awkward for Black because of S "iWe2!. Compare the gambit in the next game, in which White has the same configuration but has com- mitted to ltJf3, meaning that the move f3 isn't available. 4~c4 White gives up a second pawn for space and development. 4 ltJxc3 is the important move- order mentioned above in the note to 2 d4, played by Alekhine and recommended by Nigel Davies. Then after 4 ... ltJc6, S ltJf3 is a Goring Gambit, of which the next game is an example. But White also has S ~c4 and can retain more flexibility by not committing his king's knight. After 4 ltJxc3, Black won't want to continue 4 ... ltJf6?! S eS! 'W/e7 6 ~e2. Note also that after 4 ... ~b4 S i.c4 ltJc6, 6 ltJf3 is the main line of the Goring Gambit (see the next game), but 6 ltJe2!? is a sensible alternative, protecting c3 and leaving White's f-pawn able to advance at a later time. 4 ... cxb2 5 ~xb2 (D)

5 ..• ~b4+ It is considered that the Danish is theoreti- cally sound, and there's no way for Black to guarantee himself the better game. But there are a number of respectable alternatives that give satisfactory play, and some whose assess- ments are not established. Here is a selection: a) A miserly solution that used to be talked about in older books is S. .. c6 6ltJc3 d6 7 ltJf3 ltJd7!, with the idea of meeting 8 O-O with 8 ... ltJcS. I won't go into the details, but by means of ... i.e6, Black hopes to snuff out White's at- tack, while he is covering key squares such as dS and b3.It's difficult to believe that Black can play so slowly, but the line illustrates how well pawns that cover central squares can serve as de- fenders; in that respect, you might compare the Sicilian Defence. The other move that goes with this sequence is 8. .. ltJb6, to gain time on White's bishop, intending 9 ~b3 ~e6. Of course, White still has a dangerous attack, and also has many options on moves 6, 7 and 8; for example, he can try to combine ltJc3 and "fIie2/c2 with O-O-O, while ltJdS can be a sacrificial theme. Strange to say, although S ... c6 and 6 ... d6 used to be a standard recommendation, no modem source that I've seen mentions it. b) S. .. d6 can lead to all sorts of positions and transpositions. Since 6 ... ~e6 is a threat to break the attack, White often plays 6 ~b3 "fIid7 (6 ... ltJh6 is complex) 7ltJc3, intending 7 ... ltJc6 8 ltJdS, and if 8 ... ltJaS, then 9 "fIig3!. This may
GAMBITS 137
not be decisive, but it retains a strong attack for the two pawns. c) S. .. dS is a very well-known idea. Black can either give back both pawns and seek equal- ity, or try to hold on to one of them. Play contin- ues 6 i.xdS (D) (6 exdS blocks off White's attacking bishop, allowing 6 ... lLlf6 7 lLlc3 i.d6 with a solid extra pawn).
B
There is extensive theory here, and I'll try to present just enough for you to work with: c1) 6 ... lLlf6 is tricky: 7 i.xf7+!? (this seem- ingly devastating move only wins a pawn, but re-establishes a material balance; 7lLlc3!? lLlxdS S lLlxdS is an ambitious way for White to retain more chances - then S. .. lLld7! has the idea ... c6 and avoids the ancient trap S. .. c6? 9lLlf6+! gxf6 10 'iVxdS+ 'ittxdS 11 i.xf6+) 7 ... 'ittxf7 S'iVxdS i.b4+ (Black's point) 9 'iVd2 i.xd2+ 10 lLlxd2. This simplified position was once regarded as favourable for Black because of his queenside majority, but it is probably about equal (after all, White has a kingside majority!). Play can con- tinue 1O . ...l::.eS 11 lLlgf3 (or 11 i.xf6?! gxf6 12 ttJgf3 ttJa6 13 O-O b6! intending ... i.b7, ... lIadS and ... lLlcs; 11 f3 is a consolidating option, al- though eventually White would like to get his kingside majority moving with f4) l1...lLlc6 12 O-O i.g4 13 lIfel lIadS 14 h3 i.e6 with a bal- anced and unresolved position. c2) 6 ... i.b4+ and now: c21) 7 'It>f1?! is well answered by 7 ... lLlf6!, with the idea S 'iVa4+? lLlc6 9 i.xc6+ bxc6 10 'iVxb4?? (but after 10 eS 'iVd3+ 11 lLle2 i.a6 12 'iVxc6+ lLld7 Black wins at least a piece) 1O ... 'iVd1+ 11 'iVel i.a6+ 12 lLle2 i.xe2+ 13 'ittgl 'iVxel #. c22) 7 lLlc3 i.xc3+ S i.xc3 lLlf6, and once White has lost his attacking piece on dS, he may still have enough compensation for the pawn, but no more than that. His best line seems to be 9 'it'f3 lLlxdS 10 exdS O-O 11 lLle2, when in practice, the opposite-coloured bishops - fa- vouring the attacker - have combined with prospects of lLlg3-hS or lLlf4-hS to produce balanced results. c23) 7 lLld2 (this maintains a threat on g7) 7 ... i.xd2+ (after 7 ... lLle7, White might play S i.xf7+ 'ittxf7 9 ~b3+ lLldS! 10 O-O-O! 'iVe7 11 exdS and Black's king is exposed; 7 ... 'ii;>fS!? is a curious alternative, protecting g7 and dodging ~a4+; the Danish Gambit is by no means worked out) S "i!Vxd2lLlf6 9 ~gS (9 'it'c3!? is an alternative: 9 ... c6 10 i.b3 O-O 11 lLlf3 i.e6!? and here White might try 120-0 'iVe7 13lLld4!?) 9 ... O-O 10 O-O-O 'iVe7 11 lLle2 with some at- tacking prospects. Black has a material plus, however, and 'dynamically equal' seems a fair verdict. 6 lLlc3 lLlf6 7 lLle2 (D)
B
White develops calmly. Black has to be care- ful that eS doesn't create big trouble, and sim- ply 'iVb3 with O-O-O is also in the air. 7 ••. lLlxe4? This is really too greedy. Black should try to develop something by 7 ... lLlc6 or 7 ... O-O, or break in the centre with 7 ... dS. I've chosen this game to illustrate the most elementary gambit situation, in which rapid development and open lines triumph over material advantage. 80-0! Now every white piece is out, and lLlxe4 is a threat, along with lLldS.

You can see the appeal of a gambit that is based upon development and line-clearance. In the 19th century, Black tended to be a little more cooperative in allowing such attacks, but the Danish Gambit can still be fun to play today. Let's tum to its cousin, the Goring Gambit. I'm going to switch to heavier analytical mode, because it's so important to know precise moves if you're going to enter into either side of this opening.

Black may also decline the pawn. In the last game, we saw (by transposition) 4 ... dS S exdS 'ifxdS 6 cxd4 .Jtg4 7 .Jte2 .Jtb4+ 8 lbc3. Here are two other ways: a) 4 ... lbge7 (D) closely resembles 3 ... lbe7 versus the Danish, and the ideas are the same. w I think that Black can get an objectively equal game by controlling the light squares, but both sides will be able to create a fighting im- balance: al) S lbxd4!? lbxd4! 6 cxd4 dS 7 eS lbfS (trying to get ... cS in) 8lbc3 c6! presents White with the problem of what to do about the threat of 9 ...

Indeed, 19 ... i.h3 20 g3 i.xfl 21 ':'xfl is clearly better for White with his two pawns for the exchange and Black's queenside weaknesses. 5lbxc3 This distinguishes the Goring Gambit. White can also proceed in Danish Gambit style with S i.c4, which opens up some new possibilities after S. .. cxb2 (S ... c2!?) 6 i.xb2, but in the end, the simple S. .. lbf6 (with the idea 6 eS dS!) is probably best answered by 6lbxc3 or 6 O-O d6 7lbxc3, transposing to other main lines below. S. .. d6 also transposes after 6lbxc3, but if White is a lunatic, he can try Marshall's amazing re- sponse 6 'it'b3 ~d7! (guarding f7 and threaten- ing ... lbaS) 7 ~xc3!!??

Again, White's sneaky move-order with 2 d4 (described in the last game) might have given White more leeway in these lines, since without having com- mitted to lbf3, he could play an early lbge2, f4 or even iib3, just to take the game out of main- stream theory. At any rate, it's easy for Black to go wrong in the Goring, and even fairly strong players can

The most important line goes 7 ... flid7 (with the idea ... tDa5; 7 ... tDa5 8 ~xf7+ ..t;>f8 9 ~a4 ..t;>xf7 10 ~xa5 leaves Black's king a bit ex- posed, and the advance e5 will be a theme) 8 tDd5!; for example, 8 ... tDge7 (8 ... tDa5? 9 ~c3 tDxc4 10 ~xg7) 9 'ii'c3! O-O 10 O-O tDg6?! (re- turning the pawn by 1O ... tDxd5 11 exd5 tDe5! 12 tDxe5 dxe5 13 'iWxe5 ':'e8 gives Black roughly equal chances) 11 b4 ~b6 12 a4 tDce5 13 tDxb6?!

White really has to develop speedily at all costs. 6 ... d6 6 ... ~xc3+ 7 bxc3 d6 is also possible. It usu- ally transposes (8 'YWb3, for example, is the note to 7 O-O) but has the benefit of forcing White to capture with a pawn on c3. In principle, White could exploit this move-order with ~a3 and e5, but that's hard to implement successfully. Simply 6 ... tDf6 is a major option. Then the line 7 e5 d5 (7 ... tDe4?? 8 'i'd5) 8 exf6 dxc4 9 'i'xd8+ tDxd8 10 fxg7 lIg8 has been around for a long time. Now: a) 11 O-O!? ~xc3 (versus tDd5) 12 bxc3 is a unique and little-tested approach. White gives up the g-pawn in order to gain pressure in the centre and on the queenside: 12 ... f6 (upon 12 .. J:txg7 13 lIel+, play can go 13 ... ~e6 14 ~f4 ':'c8 15 lIe2 with ideas of tDd4 or tDg5; nor is 13 ... tDe6 14 ~h6 lIg6 15 ~f4 attractive) 13 .l:f.el+(l3tDd4..t;>f714~f4c615~d6l1e816 .:tfe 1 tDe6 17 ~f8 ~d7 18 tDxe6 will be drawn) 13 ... ..t;>f7 14 lIe4!? b6! 15 ~h6 ~b7 16 lIxc4 tDe6 (16 ... ~xf3! 17 gxf3 ..t;>g6 18 ~f4 c5 19 ~g3 tDe6) 17 tDh4! ~d5 18 .l:ta4 tDxg7 19 lIdl ~e6 20 f3 tDe8 21 ~f4 tDd6 22 ~xd6 lIgd8, and the action subsided in Ketola-A.Ivanov, ICCF email 2004. b) Traditionally White plays 11 ~h6 ~xc3+ 12 bxc3 (D).

Now Black has pursued two main paths. The resulting lines are very concrete: bl) Black mayor may not stand satisfacto- rilyafter 12 ... tDe6 130-O-O, but it's easy to fall into trouble; for example, 13 ... tDxg7 (l3 ... tDc5? 14 tDg5 tDd3+ 151Ixd3! cxd3 16 tDxh7 ..t;>e7 17 l:tel + ~e6 18 f4 f5 19 g4 ..t;>d6 20 gxf5 ~xf5 21 tDf6 with a winning game, Levy-Karaklajic, Cienfuegos 1972) 14 lIhel+ (or 14 tDh4!?) 14 ... tDe6 (l4. .. ~e6 15 g4! and now 15 ... lId8?! 16 tDd4! .l:f.d5 17 f4..t;>d8 18 ~xg7 lIxg7 19

I've given a lot of details in this section, so that you can pick up this open- ing right away if you're interested. Milner-Barry Gambit The Danish and Goring Gambits are classic ex- amples of 1 e4 e5 gambits which jettison cen- tral pawns for development and attack. The same idea can be used against other openings. Here's an example from the French Defence. R. Moyer - B. Kaczmarek corr. 1969

6.Bd3
In the vast majority of cases, White plays this move with the intention of gambiting the d-pawn. We saw 6 .Be2 in the introductory
146 MASTERING THE CHESS OPENINGS
Chapter 3 of Volume 1, and 6 a3 is also played; both of those moves keep White's d-pawn de- fended by the queen on d 1. B 6 .•. cxd4 7 cxd4 .Jtd7 (D) Black prepares to capture on d4. Notice that 7 ... liJxd4?? loses a piece to 8 liJxd4, since 8 .. :~xd4?? 9 .JtbS+ costs Black his queen. w 80-0 Formally speaking, it is this move that intro- duces the Milner-Barry Gambit. White's d-pawn cannot be comfortably defended, since 8 .Jte3? allows 8 .. :iVxb2, and 8 .Jtc2 runs into 8 ... liJb4 9 .Jtb3 (to preserve the bishop-pair generally, and his good bishop in particular; 9 .Jta4 'ilVa6! threatens ... liJd3+) 9 ... 1I¥a6!, preventing castling and preparing ... liJd3+. White can also gambit the pawn with 8 liJc3 first, which normally transposes after 8 ... liJxd4 if White continues with the natural 9liJxd4 'ilVxd4 10 O-O (10 'ilVe2 has the drawback that Black can play 1O ... f6!; compare the next note). Here the bold move 9 liJgS !? is sometimes tried and might be fun to play, although like other slower moves in the Milner-Barry, it allows Black to retreat and at- tack the e-pawn via 9 ... liJc6!. 8 ..• liJxd4 9liJxd4 'ilVxd4 10 liJc3 (D) 10 'iVe2 first can run into the instructive 1O .. .f6!, decimating the centre and frustrating an attack; for example, 11 exf6 (11 'ilVhS+ ~d8 12 1I¥f7liJe7! develops quickly; Black's extra pawn and superior centre more than make up for his king position) ll...liJxf6 12 liJc3 i.d6 with ideas of ... WVeS, ... 'iVh4 and ... O-O. If Black wants to, he can also answer 10 ~e2 by 10 ... a6, when 11 liJc3 liJe7 transposes to the main line with- out Black having had the chance for 10 .. :iVxeS. After 10 liJc3, we should ask what White has for his pawn, and why he is offering Black an- other one. Essentially, the answer is the same as in the Danish and Goring Gambits: he has cleared out central lines and taken a lead in de- velopment. But there are some differences: in those double e-pawn examples, White con- trolled the centre with a pawn on e4 facing one on d7 or d6. Here he faces a central majority of pawns and a very solid black pawn-structure. Thus White has little long-term compensation, and the onus falls on him to drum up quick ac- tion with his pieces. 10••. 'ifxe5 (D) Now it's a truly 'primitive' gambit, with both centre pawns cleared away. While 1O ... 'ii'xeS is the riskiest move, losing still more time without developing, it is in some sense the most princi- pled: Black gains not only a key central pawn, but a 2:0 majority in the centre. In the next game we see 10 ... a6. w 11 l:te1 'iVd6?

Black loses even more time in this way. He should return one of the pawns and get devel- oped by 11..:~b8! 12liJxdS i.d6, which is an- other main line that is held to be at least equal for Black. White can try to work up chances by 13 'iig4 ~f8 14 i.d2, when a typical sequence is 14 ... hS IS 'iih3 liJh6 16 liJe3 ~g8 17 liJc4 iLf4 18 i.xf4 'iixf4, after which White has to improve upon 19liJeS?! liJg4 20 ~g3 'iVxg3 21 hxg3 liJxeS 22l:f.xeS i.c6 23 i.e4? f6! 24 l:!xe6 ~f7, Weeramantry-Berrocal, Turin Olympiad 2006. 12 liJbS! i.xbS 12 ...

In fact, that's what happens. But you should re- alize that this is only because of the unusual ex- tent of that lead in development. If it were Black's move, for example, he could develop straightforwardly (by ... liJf6) and even have a substantial advantage, because it's so difficult to attack a strong pawn-centre without the help of pawn-breaks. That's why so few gambits rely entirely upon piece-play. 14 'iihS! After 14 'iif3?!, a nice example went 14. .. f6?

6 .ltd3 cxd4 7 cxd4 .ltd7 8 O-O tDxd4 9 tDxd4 ~xd410 tDc3 a6 (D) This is Black's most popular move. He re- frains from grabbing a second pawn and pauses to prevent tDb5. 1O ... a6 also clears the a7-square for the manoeuvre ... iLc5-a7. Sometimes Black will try to anticipate White's intentions and get out of the way, for example by 1O ... 'ii'b6 at this point. But in many situations after a queen has captured a pawn in any opening, even if it seems vulnerable to attack, it does well not to retreat too quickly, because while in the enemy camp, a queen forces the opponent to defend certain pieces and squares and thus prevents him from developing too easily. w Here, for example, White's queen can't wan- der too far from his d3-bishop. Furthermore, as you will see, Black's queen on d4 supports the move ... f6. At any rate, after 10 ... a6, Black threatens a successful capture on e5, and if that isn't appropriate, he would like to get on with his development. In tum, White has numerous attacking ideas. Probably none of them will fully compensate for his pawn if Black plays perfectly. But in practice, you can play this position as White against opponents of considerable strength. Here is a general breakdown of some lines from this much-contested position: 11 "iVe2 tDe7

the ideas of ... h5 and ... tDh6-g4, while keeping open a retreat-path to d8. 12~hl After 12 .l:tdl, Black can ignore the discov- ered attack and play 12 ... tDc6!; e.g., 13 .ltxa6 'ii'xe5 14 ~xe5?! tDxe5 15 .ltxb7 .l:ta7 16 .ltxd5 exd5 17 .l:tel f6 18 f4 .ltc5+ 19 ~hl d4 and Black had taken over in Mnatsakanian-Monin,

have been written about the Morra, including whole ones about specialized subvariations, so I'll have to be content with presenting a struc- tural overview that concentrates upon the most important variations. In doing so, I'll attempt not to skimp too much on details so that the reader can get a good start on a Morra and/or anti-Morra repertoire.

3 ... dxc3 Most of the time, Black takes up the chal- lenge and accepts the pawn. As usual, he can decline the gambit in many ways, among them the following: a) 3 ... d3 denies White's knight access to c3, but doesn't gain a tempo or occupy the centre. A common idea is 4 .i.xd3 (4 c4!?) 4 .. .'~Jc6 (4 ... dS? S i.bS+) S c4, establishing a kind of Maroczy Bind. b) 3 ... dS 4 exdS 'i!VxdS S cxd4 is a line from the I e4 cS 2 c3 Sicilian, that is, 2 ... dS 3 exdS 'i!VxdS 4 d4 cxd4 S cxd4. However, in that line, Black ordinarily doesn't exchange on d4 at this early a stage, so his options are somewhat re- duced, and he must tread a little carefully. One long-established continuation is S. . .'~Jc6 6lbf3 eS (6 ... i.g4?! 7 lbc3) 7 lbc3 i.b4 8 i.d2 i.xc3 9 i.xc3 e4 10 lbeS. c) Similarly, 3. .. lbf6 4 eSlbdS is a main line of the 2 c3 Sicilian (1 e4 cS 2 c3 lbf6 3 eS lbdS
4 d4 cxd4). To be well prepared on either side,
you should consult the theory of the 2 c3 Sicil- ian. d) 3 ... eS!? used to have a poor reputation, but is not so bad. One variation goes 4lbf3lbc6 S i.c4 (S cxd4 exd4 6 lbxd4 and now both 6 ... i.h4+ and 6 ... lbf6 7 lbxc6 dxc6 8 'ilkxd8+ 'it>xd8 9 f3 are known lines which offer White a very slight edge) S. .. i.cS!? (Langrock prefers White after S. . .l bf6 6lbgS!? dS 7 exdS lbxdS 8 ~b3! i.e6 9 'ilkxb7 J::!.c8 10 O-O, although Black might want to dispute that assessment; the rare S ... ~c7!? is quite a logical move - then maybe 6 'ilVb3 is best, intending 6 ... d6 7 cxd4 exd4 8 O-O lbf6 9 i.gS!, but Langrock analyses 6 O-O lbf6 7 lbgS lbd8 8 'ilkb3 lbe6 9 f4! i.cs 10 lbxf7!? to an indefinite conclusion) 6 b4!? i.b6 (6 ... .i.d6 may improve: 7 bSlbaS 8 i.e2lbf6 9 cxd4 lbxe4 10 O-O i.e7) 7 bS lbaS 8 lbxeS lbxc4 9lbxc4 dS!? 10 lbxb6 'ilkxb6 (1O ... axb6 11 'iVxd4!) 11 exdS with an extra pawn. The reason that Black doesn't decline the Morra Gambit more often is that the methods of doing so are unambitious, and in many cases slightly inferior. If nothing else, his winning chances are appreciably reduced. 4lbxc3 (D)

set-up introduces two interesting defences fol- lowing 6 Sl.c4: a) 6 ... a670-0b5 8Sl.b3.l:ta7!?(D). Thema- noeuvre .. J:ta7-d7 is the defining idea of the Chicago Defence: Black intends to shore up d6, thus dissuading the attacking move e5 for the foreseeable future. Then ... Sl.b7 may well fol- low, or simply ... tbf6 and ... Sl.e7. The rook also supports a potential ... d5. In return, White gets a few tempi to decide where to put his pieces. He can, for example, play Sl.e3 and tbd4, con- templating sacrifices on e6, but also preparing to attack with f4-f5. Actually, Black has a number of move-orders with which to introduce ... .l:ta7-d7, and 8 ... .l:ta7 may not be as accurate as Langrock's prefer- ence 8 ... tbc6! 9 "iVe2 .l:ta7 (upon 9 ... Sl.e7 10 l:!dl .l:ta7 11 Sl.e3 .l:td7, the remarkable piece sacri- fice 12 tba4! bxa4 13 Sl.xa4 has been tested and analysed, with White apparently holding the upper hand) 10 Sl.e3 .l:td7 11 .l:tac1 Sl.b7, and now 12 tbd4 is a sound way to continue the at- tack, but Langrock-Reddman, Cuxhaven 2001 saw 12 tbxb5!? axb5 13 "iVxb5 tbge7 14 tbd4 tba7! (an improvement upon several earlier games) 15 "iVh5 g6 16 "iVh3!? with a compli- cated game ahead. Again, White's strategy is based upon piece-play, noticeably the various potential sacrifices on e6. w Be that as it may, after 8 ... l:ta7 (pictured in the diagram), the game RJunge-Vatter, Bun- desliga 1988/9 was exciting and highly instruc- tive: 9 "iVe2 (9 Sl.g5!? is a good developing move, and it sets the trap 9 ... Sl.e7? 10 "iVd4!, forking a7 and g7!; instead, Black can play 9 ... tbe7, whereas 9 ... tbf6!? 10 e5!? is messy) 9 ... Sl.e7?! (9 ... tbc6 is more precise, preparing to exchange a knight if it comes to d4) 10 Sl.e3 .l:td7 11 tbd4! Sl.f6 (1l...tbf6? walks into 12 Sl.xe6! fxe6 13 tbxe6 'iVa5 14 a3!, threatening to trap the queen with b4 and meeting 14 ... b4 with 15 "iVc4!) 12 f4 tbe7? (12 ...

J:tb7 19 b4! intending 19 ... fixb4 20 .l:td8+ ~e7 21 "iHf7#. Notice that White's attacking themes in this note are not all that different from the ones we see in mainstream Sicilian Defence variations. b) The Finegold Defence tries to develop the queenside first, and can involve a funny-looking fianchetto of the queen: 6 ... tbf6 7 O-O a6 (or 7 ... Sl.e7 8 fie2 a6) 8 ~e2 b5 (or 8 ... tbbd7) 9 Sl.b3 tbbd7 10 .l:tdl (D). Now: bI) 10 ... fib6!? has the idea 11 Sl.e3 fib7; the b7-square turns out to be a good one for Black's queen in several variations.

All of this is open for de- bate. c) Another move-order with the same idea is 6 ... iLe7 7 O-O ttJf6 8 ~e2 a6, when 9l:!.dl bS 10 iLb3 ttJbd7 is line 'b2' above. Langrock sug- gests instead 9 eS!?; for example, 9 ... dxeS 10 ttJxeS O-O 11 ltdl ttJbd7 12 iLf4 ~e8!? 13 iLd3!?

Let's return to 4 ... ttJc6 (D). w 5 ttJf3 S iLc4 is an appealing move-order finesse. Then someone looking to escape the books and stay aggressive as White might consider S ... d6 6 f4!? with the idea of ttJf3 and a potential eS. Against S. .. e6, however, 6 f4?!, is strongly met by 6 ... iLcS!, so White should probably trans- pose with 6 ttJf3. A possible advantage of S iLc4 could come in the line S. .. g6, when White has various tries to avoid the main lines given in the next note (which deals with S ttJf3 g6). For example, 6 ~3!? (6 iLgS i.g7 7 'ilVdS!? e6 8 'ilVd2 might be worth a try) 6 ... e6 (6 ... ttJeS 7 iLf4 ttJxc4 8 'ilVxc4 d6 9 ttJdS) 7 ttJf3 ttJaS 8 'ilVa4 a6! (8 ... ttJxc4 9 'ilVxc4 a6 10 'ilVd4 f6 II O-O with terrific development) 9 i.e2 bS 10 'ilVd4 and White has some play for the pawn due to his development and Black's dark-square weak- nesses. 5 ... d6 We'll see combinations of ... e6 and ... a6 in the next game. S. .. g6 is known as the Fianchetto Defence, which has a sound reputation. If Black can get ... i.g7 and ... d6 in, his position will be well-nigh unassailable. Therefore, to justify his gambit, White needs to act quickly. One of the main lines goes 6 i.c4 (6 h4 ttJf6! 7 hS ttJxhS 8 .l:IxhS!? gxhS 9 ttJgS ultimately seems to fail to Langrock's 9 ... i.g7! 10 'ilVxhS l:!.f8 11 i.c4 iLxc3+! 12 bxc3 ttJeS 13 iLb3 'ilVaS and Black wins) 6 ... iLg7 (6 ... d6 is also apparently play- able, intending 7 iLgS iLe6!; White's best seems to be 7 eS iLg7! 8 exd6 ttJf6! 90-00-010 dxe7 ttJxe7 11 ~e2 with a small edge) 7 eS!?

7 ... ttJxeS (7 ... ttJh6 8 iLf4 O-O 9 O-O d6! 10 exd6 exd6 is held to be equal, although White has a number of tries, including 11 'ifd2 ttJfS 12 .l:i.fel and l:!.adl, as opposed to 11 iLxd6 l:le8 with equal play) 8 ttJxe5 iLxeS 9 iLxf7+ 'it>xf7 10 'ifdS+ ~g7! (1O ... e6 II 'iVxeS ii'f6 12 'iVc7!

6 ... a6 Many players feel that this is the most reli- able defence in the Morra Gambit complex, or at least the easiest to play. Black retains the idea of ... ..tg4, and also the flexibility to decide be- tween ... e6 and ... e5. In any case, we've come to a major splitting point where Black needs to commit to a structural choice. One of the main defensive lines begins with 6 ... e6, but you might also want to check out the move 6 ... ltJf6, which, if playable, can cut down the number of White's options: a) 6 ... e6 7 O-O leads to two other standard positions: al) 7 ... ..te7 8 'i*'e2 a6 (8 ... ..td7 9 l:f.dl and now 9 ... a6 transposes, while 9 ... ltJf6 10 ..tgS! introduces the idea of ..txf6, damaging Black's pawn-structure, and prepares to double on the d-file; naturally, that's not fatal for Black, but keeps the game lively) 9l:f.dl (D). This is White's basic set-up in the Morra Gambit. As befits a 'primitive' gambit, White relies mainly upon piece-play, almost never re- sorting to f4 or g4-g5, as he does in the Open Sicilian (see Volume 1). Instead, development by ..te3, ..tf4 or ..tg5 follows, hoping to exploit the weaknesses in Black's position, such as d6 and b6, and, with luck, using his single pawn- break e5. Black can argue that he has an extra pawn and a central majority, the latter covering all of White's potential forward posts cS, dS, eS and f5. His problem, of course, is catching up in development. Some sophisticated players use the following move-order: 9 ... ..td7 (Black de- lays ... ltJf6 so as to prevent White from placing his bishop on g5 early on; he also blocks the d- file in the face of 10 eS) 10 ..tf4 eS 11 ..te3ltJf6 12 l:td2 O-O 13 Itadl h6 (13 ... b5 14..tb3ltJaS! is recommended by Langrock, although White might bailout with the tactic ISltJxeS!? ltJxb3 16 axb3 dxeS 17ltJdS! ltJxdS 18 .l:txd5, when 18 ... ..te6! 19 l::txd8 l:f.fxd8 looks about equal) 14 ltJh4!? ltJa5 (14 ... b5 IS ..tb3 b4 16 ltJa4 ltJxe4 17 ..tb6 ltJxd2 18 ..txd8 ltJxb3 leads to equality, according to Langrock) 15ltJg6ltJxc4 16 ltJxe7+ 'i*'xe7 17 'iUxc4 ..te6 18 'iib4 :ac8 (18 ... b5!? 19 :xd6 .l::i.fb8 has the idea of ... ltJe8 and/or ... a5) 19 .l:txd6 l::tc4 20 ~6 :fc8 21 f3 .l:.4c6 1/2-1/2 N.Regan-Holm, London 1994. a2) 7 ... ltJf6 8 'iUe2 ..te7 9 .l::!.dl eS!?

154 MASTERING THE CHESS OPENINGS
Black sacrifices a whole tempo and cedes the dS-square, but stops eS and intends ... ~g4 to increase his new-found control over d4, or sim- ply ... ~e6. As compensation for Black's extra pawn, White has space and control of the dS- square. One important line goes 10 ~e3 (10 h3 has been played a lot, when 10 ... O-O 11 ~e3 ~e6 or 11.. .a6 is a typical follow-up) 10 ... O-O (1O ... ~g4 11 h3 ~hS!? 12 g4 ~g6 13lLlM! in- tends lLlfS) 11 b4! (a typical queenside space- grab) 11...~g4 (l1...lLlxb4 12lLlxeS eliminates Black's hard-earned central presence) 12 a3. This position introduces a middlegame that ap- pears about equal. White doesn't have immedi- ate threats, but Black has some issues with the weakness of his dS-square, and has to find a way to redeploy his forces. b) 6 ... lLlf6!?, sometimes thought to be dubi- ous, has the advantage that after 7 O-O (7 ~gS e6), Black can play 7 ... a6 and transpose into the line 6 ... a6 7 O-O without having to face 6 ... a6 7 ~gS. White's standard reply has been 7 eS (D).

Now Black can't play 7 .. .lbxeS?? 8 lLlxeS dxeS?? 9 ~xf7+; this is a recurring theme in gambit play. Nor is 7 ... dS 8 ~bS comfortable. Two others: bl) After 7 ... dxeS?! 8 'ikxd8+ lLlxd8 9lLlbS ~b8, White should continue 10 lLlc7+! 'it>d7 11 lLlbS!, because if 11...'it>e8, which may well be best, Black can no longer castle and White can play 12lLlxeS. b2) After 7 ... lLlg4! no one has demonstrated an advantage for White: b21) If White chooses 8 exd6, then the type of position after 8 ... exd6 9 ~f4 ~e7 10 O-O O-O is one that often arises in Morra lines. One try is 11 'iVe2 ~e8 12l:tfel ~d7 13 'iVc2!? with the dual ideas of'iVb3 and l:tadl. 8 ... 'iVxd6 is play- able, when 9 O-O!? or the attacking 9 'iVe2 is more attractive than 9 'iVxd6. b22) 8 e6!? fxe6 9lLlgSlLlgeS (9 ... lLlf6?! 10 lLlxe6) 10 lLlxe6 'iVaS 11 ~b3 ~xe6 12 ~xe6 'iVa6!; neither side can castle, and Langrock gives various lines that lead to equality. Finally, we return to 6 ... a6 (D): w 70-0 Already White might want to look for some- thing harder-hitting. An often-recommended idea for him is 7 ~gS, with the line 7 ... lLlf6 8 ~xf6 gxf6 9 O-O e6 (9 ... l:tg8!?) 10 lLld4. It has been pointed out that this is virtually the same position as a sideline of the Richter-Rauzer Si- cilian with the same tempi but White having a pawn less! After 1O ... ~e7, intending ... O-O and ... 'it>h8, Langrock continues 11 lLlxc6 bxc6 12 llVg4, with the idea of 'iVg7, interfering with the coordination of Black's pieces. Still, Black has the bishop-pair and an extra pawn, which Silman recommends giving back by 12 .. :iVaS (but Black can also be greedy with 12 ... ~f8 or delay White's win of the h-pawn by 12 ... hS!? 13 'ikg7 ~f8 14 'iVh7 l:tb8 with ideas of .. .'iWaS and ...

set-ups. In particular, 8 'Yi'e2?! i.g4! 9l:Idl e6 has scored brilliantly for Black over the years, getting the bishop out without the disadvantage of having to play ... eS (and in doing so, ceding dS). After 10 i.f4, 10 ... tbhS! 11 i.e3 'Yi'f6 (or
11...ttJeS) is effective. White has almost noth-

8 ... i.g4 This is consistent with ... d6 and ... a6, but not the only move. a) White's first point is that 8 ... ttJxb4?! 9 eS! is very awkward for his opponent: 9 ... dS (9 ... dxeS?? 10 i.xf7+ - that trick again!) 10 'Yi'a4+ ttJc6 11 l:Idl i.d7 12 ttJxd5 ttJxdS 13 i.xdS e6 14 i.xc6 bxc6 IS i.e3 with a promis- ing attack against Black's queenside weak- nesses. b) A simple and common-sense alternative is 8 ... e6 9 bS (9 a3!? is perhaps best; having es- tablished an edge in space, White would then switch back to conventional development with i.f4) 9 ... axbS! 10 i.xbS i.e7.

The developing player would do well to try out the Morra Gambit upon occasion. It can serve to improve your tactical skills, while throwing a lot of Sicilian Defence players off balance. Even in slow openings such as the Caro- Kann Defence, there are respectable gambits in this category; for example, White clears out the centre for activity in the variation 1 e4 c6 2 4Jf3 dS 3 ttJc3 i.g4 4 h3 i.xf3 5 'iixf3 e6 6 d4 dxe4 7 4Jxe4!? ~xd4 8 i.d3, intending to attack with the help of the open central files. Blackmar-Diemer Gambit
1 d4 by its nature develops less dramatically
than 1 e4, but I should mention some fairly mainstream examples of primitive gambits in d-pawn openings. The most obvious example is the Blackmar-Diemer Gambit, which goes 1 d4 d5 2 e4 dxe4 and either 3 f3 or 3 4Jc3 4Jf6 4 f3 exf3 5 4Jxf3, the latter a mirror-image of the Goring Gambit. Once more, there are books and many publications on this opening. There are many wonderful traps and tactics in the Blackmar-Diemer, and it may be worth experi- menting with, but I don't think it quite holds up against accurate defence. To keep the coverage concise, I'll bypass much of the fun and give a respectable example: Alexander - Golombek British Ch, Nottingham 1946

Unfortunately, serious move-order issues can interfere with White's plans in the Blackmar- Diemer. Here 2 4Jc3 ttJf6 3 e4 is also played, when 3 ... dxe4 transposes. But Black can also play 3 ... ttJxe4 4 4Jxe4 dxe4, which has been pretty effective in practice. Some fans of the gambit are willing to accept that and work around it. Others feel that 2 e4 dxe4 3 4Jc3 may be the best move-order, even if White has to deal with 3 ... e5 in the note to Black's third move. 2• •• dxe4 3 4Jc3 Upon the immediate 3 f3, 3 ... eS! is known to be good.

4 ••. exf3 Black can also decline the gambit. Among other tries, 4 ... c6 is a particularly useful semi- waiting move. Black's first point is that 5 fxe4 e5! makes structural gains. Black has the advan- tage after 6 dxe5 (6 d5 is met by 6 ... i.b4; 6 ttJf3 exd4 7 ~xd4 'ii'xd4 8 ttJxd4 may be best, but both 8 ... i.b4 and 8 ... i.c5 with the idea ...

Other moves for White include 5 i.c4 'ii'a5! and 5 i.g5 ttJbd7, which is a variation of the Veresov Opening, that is, 1 d4 d5 2 ttJc3 ttJf6 3 .tg5 ttJbd7 4 f3 c6 5 e4 dxe4. In that line, 6 fxe4 e5! 7 dxe5 'ii'aS! with the idea 8 exf6 'ii'xg5 is known to be at least equal for Black. Finally, 5 ttJxe4 isn't what White wants in terms of structure (the pawn on f3 is misplaced); then 5 ... ttJbd7 already equalizes or more. 5 ttJxf3 Black has an overwhelming record versus 5 ~xf3? His pawn advantage is safe after 5 ... g6 or 5 ... c6, which leave no weaknesses in the po- sition. With care, Black can also get away with 5 ... ~xd4!, since White can't win enough time attacking the queen to succeed in attack.
5. .. c6
This is one of the better defences. Black strengthens his control of d5 without blocking off his queen's bishop, which can develop to f5 or g4. To my mind, the frequently-played alter- natives 5 ... e6 and 5 ... g6, analysed in remark- able detail over many years, offer White more chances to work up a significant attack. 6 i.c4 (D) Black does very well against other moves; for example, 6 ttJe5 ttJbd7 (or 6 ... i.f5), and 6 i.d3 i.g4!' 6 .•. i.f5 White gets what he wants after 6 ... i.g4?? 7 ttJe5! i.e6 (7 ... i.xdl?? 8 i.xf7#; 7 ... i.h5?? 8 'ii'xh5) 8 i.xe6 fxe6 (Black's isolated e-pawns are not only targets, but they also imprison Black's bishop) 9 O-O ttJbd7 10 i.f4 ttJxe5 11

That's a mirror image of the Morra Gambit. A more original idea arises in the Queen's Gambit Semi-Slav sequence 1 d4 dS 2 c4 c6 3lbc3 e6, if White continues 4 e4!? dxe4 (4 ... i.b4 is the most promising way to decline the offer) S lbxe4 i.b4+ 6 i.d2!? 'iVxd4 7 i.xb4 'iVxe4+ 8 i.e2 (D) (or 8 lbe2). White has again allowed the capture of both central pawns in order to develop quickly and open lines. The difference here is that in addi- tion to attacking chances, he has gained an es- sentially positional advantage: the dark squares in Black's camp have lost the natural protection afforded by Black's king's bishop. Neverthe- less, this sacrifice has the usual drawback of a 'primitive' gambit, that is, White's pressure on those squares is not supported by central pawns, and there are no immediate ways to break down Black's solid pawn-structure. Therefore Black will frequently manage to consolidate, espe- cially when he succeeds in playing ... e5 and freeing his bad bishop. Theory goes back and forth with respect to how this imbalance plays out, but I should say that 4 e4 has been one of White's most respectable gambits at the highest levels for many years. You may have noticed that I haven't yet mentioned any gambits by Black in the 'primi- tive' category. It's asking a lot for Black, al- ready a tempo down, to offer valuable centre pawns in pursuit of attack. For example, you sometimes see Black try 1 d4 eS 2 dxeS d6?! 3
160 MASTERING THE CHESS OPENINGS
exd6 i.xd6 at lower levels of play, but that has yet to attract much interest among masters. If White plays 4 tLlf3, he is not even behind in the number of pieces developed. On the other hand, I f4 eS 2 fxeS d6 3 exd6 i.xd6, known as the From Gambit, has a long history of grandmas- ter practice. Clearly, that's because of the fact that 1 f4 doesn't help White's development and somewhat exposes his king. See Chapter 6 for some analysis. Similarly the gambit 1 e4 cS 2 f4 dS 3 exdS tLlf6 4 c4 e6! S dxe6 i.xe6 clears out Black's centre, but leaves holes all over White's position (the moves f4 and c4 have not been productive) and gives Black a lead in develop- ment. The Hennig-Schara Gambit is a good exam- ple of a 1 d4 opening in which Black plausibly abandons his centre pawns for activity. It be- gins 1 d4 dS 2 c4 e6 3 tLlc3 cS 4 cxdS cxd4!? S ~xd4 (S "iYa4+! is a technical nicety; you can reach the main position via S. .. i.d7 6 "iYxd4 exdS 7 "iYxdS tLlc6 with 8 ... tLlf6 next, gaining another tempo on White's queen; White avoids a couple of alternate tries by Black if he plays this way) S. .. tLlc6! 6 "iYdl exdS 7 "iYxdS i.d7!; for example, 8 tLlf3 tLlf6 9 "iYdl i.cs (D) is con- sidered the main line of this gambit. w As with our other primitive gambits, Black has cleared out the centre but gained several tempi for an attack by pieces. He can pursue that in various ways; for example, by moving his queen to c7, e7 or b6, and then playing ... O-O-O or ... O-O with ... l:.d8. The dynamic old main line continues 10 e3 "iYe7 11 i.e20-O-O 12 O-O gS! 13 b4!. White returns the pawn to launch a queenside attack after 13 ... i.xb4 14 ~b3. Positional Gambits When modem chess was first developing, gam- bits were almost always used as a means to es- tablish an attacking game. Today, those gambits are still with us (see above), but we often play gambits which are positional in their orienta- tion. In these, the gambiteer retains an influen- tial pawn-centre, which is usually part of his compensation. The most common strategy em- ployed is the sacrifice of a flank pawn to estab- lish a full and often mobile pawn-centre. This can involve giving up a flank pawn in order to divert one of the opponent's centre pawns, thus establishing a pawn-majority. Or it might in- volve surrendering a flank pawn with the goal of gaining time, which is then used to establish a large centre. Note that this is the opposite of the strategy in the previous section, which in- volved clearing out one's own centre pawns! Let me begin by listing some of these gambits and examine a few others via games. To begin with, there's the King's Gambit, discussed in Volume 1: 1 e4 eS 2 f4. White of- fers his f-pawn in order to draw Black's e-pawn away from the centre. Then, ideally, he will be able to play an effective d4 and develop his pieces quickly around a mobile centre. Black has several gambits which employ the same philosophy, the two most prominent of which are the Latvian Gambit (l e4 eS 2 tLlf3 fS) and the Schliemann Defence to the Ruy Lopez (1 e4 eS 2 tLlf3 tLlc6 3 i.bS fS). The Queen's Gambit (discussed in Volume 2) is not a real gambit, at least in its pure fonn 1 d4 dS 2 c4 dxc4, because White can recover his pawn quickly. We do see a number of lines, however, in which White sacrifices a pawn for the sake of establishing a large, mobile centre; for example, 1 d4 dS 2 c4 dxc4 3 tLlf3 tLlf6 4 tLlc3 a6 S e4 bS 6 eS. An analogous line in the Slav is 1 d4 dS 2 c4 c6 3 tLlf3 tLlf6 4 tLlc3 dxc4 S e4 bS 6 eS, while 1 d4 dS 2 c4 c6 3 tLlf3 tLlf6 4 tLlc3 e6 S i.gS h6 6 i.h4 dxc4 7 e4 gS 8 i.g3 bS is a major line in the Semi-Slav. These have a rather opportunistic character, and when White succeeds he usually does so by direct assault supported by tactics, rather than by further cen- tral pawn advances.
GAMBITS 161
b4 Gambits In openings which begin with moves other than B
1 e4 or 1 d4, most gambits for White are
positionally-based flank-pawn sacrifices. In the Symmetrical variations of the English Open- ing, we find various offers involving b4; for ex- ample, 1 c4 cS 2 g3 g6 3 Ji.g2 Ji.g7 4 tbc3 tbc6 S a3 e6 6 b4!? The point is seen in the line 6 ... cxb4 7 axb4 tbxb4 8 Ji.a3 (D).

Here the considerations are more positional than tactical. White's development advantage is only slight, but he has some serious pressure on the dark squares: tbbS or tbe4 might follow, and d4 and tbf3 also hit dark squares; finally, even e4-eS is sometimes an issue. In this pre- cise position, furthermore, the knight can't be easily defended in view of 8 ... aS? 9 Ji.xb4. Consequently, the pseudo-sacrifice 6 ... tbxb4 7 axb4 cxb4 is more common, when 8 d4 bxc3
9 e3 intends tbe2xc3 and Ji.a3, a gambit with
the same dark-square themes. In Volume 3, I covered this position in some detail. In the Sicilian Defence, the diversion of the black pawn from cS arises in the Wing Gambit,
1 e4 cS 2 b4, which allows White to have more
leeway in the centre following 2 ... cxb4. He can play 3 d4 or 3 Ji.b2 at that point, but more com- monly opts for 3 a3, trying to develop quickly after 3 ... bxa3 4 tbxa3 or 4 Ji.xa3 (D). White intends to construct a large centre, but he also hopes to win dark squares and pre- vent Black from castling if he plays ... e6 or ... eS; this strategy resembles the English Opening example above. Of course, there are many options for Black even before this point, including 3 ... tbf6 or 3 ... dS. The same idea (and sometimes the same pawn-structure) arises in the French Wing Gam- bit: 1 e4 e6 2 tbf3 dS 3 eS cS 4 b4 cxb4, when White can play either the central move S d4 or the developing S a3 bxa3 6 Ji.xa3. In the Scandinavian Defence with 1 e4 dS 2 exdS "iYxdS 3 tbc3 ~a5, White can play an- other sacrifice of the b-pawn, Mieses's long- discarded 4 b4!? After 4 .. :t#Vxb4, the older S l:Ibl scrounges up some activity, but has gen- erally been ineffective because after s .. :iVd6, Black develops normally. Recently, White has played S a4! with the idea 6 Ji.a3; then Black has some problems getting developed, because White can answer ... eS or ... e6 with Ji.xf8 and prevent castling, as well as gaining influence on the dark squares. Even the move as can prove useful. Of course, this gambit may tum out to be of marginal soundness, but at least it com- bines quick development with positional con- siderations. g4 Gambits in the Dutch Defence The mirror image of the Sicilian Defence gam- bit with b4 is a Dutch Defence gambit with g4. It turns out that there are quite a few of these: Ravikumar - Nasir Ali New Delhi 1982
1 d4 f5 2 g4!?
This is called the Krejcik Gambit. White un- dertakes to divert Black's f-pawn from control of e4, just as 1 e4 cS 2 b4 tries to draw Black's
162 MASTERING THE CHESS OPENINGS
c-pawn from control of d4. White has three similar and respectable ways to gambit the g- pawn: a) The move 2 h3 has the same idea of g4, but intends to recapture on g4 with his h-pawn in case of ... fxg4, while not allowing ... g3 (see the note to move 3 in the main game). This is sometimes called the Korchnoi Attack. Play can proceed 2 ... lDf6 (after 2 ... d5, White can still continue with 3 g4 fxg4 4 hxg4 i.xg4 and 5 f3 or 5 i.h3, but that looks speculative, and it's probably more sensible to exploit the hole on e5 by 3 lDf3 and 4 i.f4) 3 g4 fxg4?! 4 hxg4lDxg4 (D), and now: w al) 5 e4 d6 6 i.g5!? g6 (6 ... c6 is recom- mended by A.Watson) 7 f3lDf6 SlDc3 c6 9 'ilVd2 with positional pressure and attacking chances, Korchnoi-Kanel, Bie11979. a2) 5 ~d3! appears still stronger, and in- cludes the trap 5 ... lDf6?? 6 .l:t.xh7!. Also terrible is 5 ... lDh6? 6 i.xh6 gxh6 7 ~f5!, threatening ~h5#. Even the best move, 5 ... g6, allows 6 J:i.xh7!? .l:txh7 7 ~xg6+ l:!.f7 S 'iVxg4, which is probably somewhat better for White, and 6 ~xh7 is by no means necessary; for example, both 6 lDf3 and 6 lDh3 generate more than enough play for a mere pawn. b) Another version of a g4 gambit in the Dutch Defence stems from Alapin's move 2 ~d3, attacking f5. Then if Black chooses 2 ... e6 (2 ... d5 is probably better), White plays 3 g4 fxg4 4 h3 gxh3 (not the only move) 5 lDxh3, which is an approximate mirror-image of a line in the Sicilian Wing Gambit. White has reason- able compensation, with ideas of lDf4 or lDg5, as well as simply i.g2 and e4. c) 2 lDc3 lDf6 (2 ... d5 is the main alterna- tive) 3 g4!? is a similar idea, when 3 ... lDxg4 (3 ... fxg4 4 h3) 4 e4 forms a big centre, and then 4 ... d6 5 i.h3 keeps up the pressure. As usual, Black's e6-square is weak. w 2 ••• fxg4 (D) 3h3
3 e4 is the next game.
3 ... gxh3?! This cedes the h-file to White, who also gets rapid development against a weakened king po- sition. 3 ... g3 4 fxg3 lDf6 is a good way to de- cline the gambit. Then 5 lDc3 d5 6 i.g2 e6 7 i.f4 i.d6 S e3 0-09 'iVd2 with the idea 9 ... lDh5 10 lDge2 leads to a nicely imbalanced position, perhaps slightly in favour of White because of Black's difficulty in achieving ... e5. 4lDxh3 (D)

White plays much as he does in the Sicilian Wing Gambit with 3 a3. 4 ... tDf6 As above, 4 ... g3 keeps White's h-file closed, but after S fxg3, there is no obvious follow-up, and White controls the centre. 5 tDc3 S hxg4 ..txg4 6 f3 is similar: 6 ... ..te6!?

White picks up material; he won easily. ... b5 Gambits in the Nimzo-Indian Defence Sometimes the offer of a pawn by ... bS can be used to divert White's c-pawn. This occurs in the Benko Gambit, discussed below, where Black completes the analogy with the Sicilian and Dutch examples by playing ... bS and then ... a6. In several variations of the Nimzo-Indian Defence, we see the same idea; for example, 1 d4 tDf6 2 c4 e6 3 tDc3 ..tb4 4 e3 O-O S tDe2 bS!? 6 cxbS a6 is a gambit based upon controlling the light squares. It was developed by Vitolins. Another type of flank pawn sacrifice is seen in this game: Short - Aleksandrov European Team Ch, Pula 1997
1 d4 tDf6 2 c4 e6 3 tDc3 ..tb4 4 ..tg5
This is the Leningrad System of the Nimzo- Indian. Now one of Black's primary methods of defence involves sacrificing a flank pawn: 4 ••• h6 5 ..tb4 c5 6 d5 b5 (D) In typical gambit style, Black undermines White's support of dS. 7 dxe6 7 cxbS gS 8 ..tg3 tDxdS works out well for Black. If White is going to decline the gambit, 7 'iVc2 with the idea of e4 is one of the best ways to do so. 7 ... fxe6 8 cxb5 d5 This is the point: once the c-pawn disap- pears, Black is able to establish a central superi- ority.

9 e3 O-O
The game we are following actually went 6 ... O-O 7 e3 b5 8 dxe6 fxe6 9 cxb5 d5, trans- posing to this position. I'm using the normal move-order because it avoids certain compli- cations. Now White has to deal with the pros- pect of Black's centre advancing further. 10 i.d3 a6!? (D) This is a familiar pattern for us by now: Black exchanges White's advanced b-pawn so as to activate his pieces. In fact, however, 10 ... d4 is more common, often leading to the forcing line 11 exd4 cxd4 12 a3 i.a5 13 b4 dxc3 14 bxa5 i.b7 15 lbe2 i.xg2 16 .l:tgl, when 16 ... i.f3 17 .l:i.g3! i.xe2 18 'iNxe2 seems to favour White, al- though it's still tricky. w 11 lbe2 White almost has to return the pawn and get his pieces out. One major point of 1O ... a6 be- comes clear in the line 11 bxa6?! d4 12 exd4 cxd4 (or 12 .. :~Vxd4!?, hitting the bishop on h4 15 ~xd3 i.xa6) 13 a3 i.a5 14 b4 dxc3 15 bxa5 ~xa5 16 lbe2 lbxa6 17 O-O lbc5 with ideas of ... lbxd3 and ... i.a6; then Black stands better. 11 •.. e4 12 i.e2 12 i.bl1eaves room on c2 for the queen.

Insisting upon playing with a material defi- cit. Simply 13 .. J:ta5! keeps Black's good struc- ture intact, because 14 a4 (14 a3 i.e7; 14 lbd4 i.xc3 15 bxc3 e5 16 lbf5 lbc6) 14 ... bxa4 15 i.xa4 i.d6 leaves White with a vulnerable b- pawn. 14 lbxb5 e5?! 14 ... i.c5 followed by ... ~b6 and/or ... lbb4 gives Black meaningful compensation, although White should keep a small edge. 15b3 White misses his chance: 15 i.xf6! ':'xf6 16 b3 gives him the better of it. Now Black in tum could play 15 ...

The obvious alternative is 8 bxc6 tLJxc6. Here Black has a multitude of ideas, including ... .tb7 and .. J:k8, or in some cases ...t LJdS and .. .fS, perhaps with .. J~b8 and ... tLJaS. He is try- ing to develop quickly and grab the initiative, of course, but even more than that he wants to con- trol the light squares and use them as a basis for attack.

The reason why these gambits are possible in the Nimzo-Indian is that Black takes an early lead in piece development when he plays
1. .. tLJf6, 3 ... .Bb4 and 4 ... O-O while White is tak-
ing time to establish a pawn-centre. A pawn sacrifice that works on the same principle in the King's Indian Defence is 1 d4 tLJf6 2 c4 g6 3 tLJc3 .Bg7 4 e4 d6 S f3 O-O 6 .te3 cS 7 dxcS dxcS 8 ~xd8l:hd8 9 i..xcs tLJc6 (D). w Black intends to exploit his lead in develop- ment, the hole on d4, and White's dark-square weaknesses. He will usually do so by ... tLJd7, unmasking the powerful g7-bishop with tempo. Notice how bad White's bishop on f1 is. In spite of the fact that White has no overt pawn weak- nesses to target, and the queens are off the board, Black's pawn sacrifice is considered sound, and this has become his most popular line of defence versus the Sarnisch Variation. Gambits in the Reti Opening Early flank pawn gambits abound in chess. Here are a few of many positional gambits in the Reti Opening (and closely related lines of the English) which involve diverting Black's d-pawn to c4: a) 1 c4 c6 2 tLJf3 dS 3 g3 tLJf6 4 i..g2 dxc4 S O-O tLJbd7 6 ~c2 tLJb6.

You'll find many variations on these themes in opening praxis. The Evans Gambit Finally, a flank pawn may be sacrificed purely for the sake of gaining time. In the classic ex- ample, the Evans Gambit, White wants to use that time to set up a large centre. Here are a cou- ple of games and a brief survey:

1 e4 e5 2ltJf3ltJc6 3 i.c4 i.c5 4 b4!? (D)
This introduces the Evans Gambit, which for some time in the 19th century was the most popular attacking opening around. The Evans is still being used by some grandmasters, and received a boost from Kasparov's successful adventures with it. This charming game shows why enthusiasts love it, and I've embedded as many important lines as I can, including some fun miniatures, to illustrate the lay of the land for potential gambiteers. 4 .•• i.xb4 5 c3 i.a5 Or: a) 5 ... i.d6!? looks funny, blocking the d- pawn, but it supports e5 and therefore allows Black to castle quickly, something he often doesn't get to do in the Evans Gambit.

Following Kasparov's example, White often prefers to stay a pawn down with 7 i.e2 exd4 8 'ili'xd4, relying on his attacking chances.

Positional Gambits of Centre Pawns Sometimes one side sacrifices a centre pawn (rather than a flank pawn), not for an attack, but with the object of improving his central posi- tion and/or establishing lasting positional ad- vantages. One simple example is the Albin Counter-Gambit, 1 d4 d5 2 c4 e5 3 dxe5 d4, which I discussed in Volume 2; Black's d-pawn cramps White and wins territory. It has a rea- sonably good reputation. The Falkbeer Coun- ter-Gambit, 1 e4 e5 2 f4 d5 3 exd5 e4, is a king's pawn mirror image of the Albin! In modem chess it has few takers, however, because the pawn on e4 can't be maintained. In Volume 3, I discussed an early central pawn sacrifice by White which has all the char- acteristics of a positional gambit: 1 c4 lDf6 2 lDc3 e6 3 e4 c5 4 e5 lDg8 5lDf3 lDc6 6 d4 cxd4 7lDxd4lDxe5 8lDdb5 (D).

Black can also gambit a central pawn simply to free his pieces, particularly if he has a reason- able chance to recover the pawn. A prime exam- ple is the Budapest Gambit, 1 d4liJf6 2 c4 e5, challenging the centre while activating Black's dark-squared bishop. After 3 dxe5, Black nor- mally plays 3 ... liJg4 (although 3 ... liJe4, which is a true gambit, remains unrefuted and is taken quite seriously by some strong players). Then White will generally return his forward e-pawn for what he hopes will be a slight positional su- periority. For example, after 4 .Bf4 liJc6 5 liJf3 .Bb4+, one line is 6liJbd2 'iWe7, when ... liJgxe5 will follow shortly, and White counts upon the fact that his c-pawn restrains ... d5, along with the idea of a timely c5, to give him some pressure. White can also play 6liJc3 .Bxc3+ 7 bxc3 'iWe7 8 'iWd5, to hang on to his material, after which Black can drum up an initiative by 8. .. f6 9 exf6 liJxf6, with compensation for the pawn; whether it is sufficient has been debated for decades. The number of positional gambits that mas- ters play is growing every year. They are enor- mously instructive to study from both sides of the board, and I recommend adding at least one or two to your own repertoire. The Ultra-Positional Benko Gambit The most important true gambit in modern times is the Benko Gambit, whose nature is about as far as possible from the Danish Gam- bit (which we saw at the start of this chapter). Because it serves no attacking or tactical pur- pose and only aims for long-term positional pressure, the Benko Gambit was effectively ig- nored for more than 100 years of modern chess. Even the positional gambits above contain pos- sibilities of attacking the king in the long run, but the Benko is ultra-positional, in that Black's play consists of queenside pressure which may not even come to fruition until the endgame. Let's begin by examining one of Pal Benko's own games from several decades ago. In essen- tial ways, little has changed since. w Camara - Benko Silo Paulo 1973 1 d4liJf6 2 c4 c5 3 d5 b5 (D) This is the Benko Gambit. 4cxb5 In the following game, I'll briefly discuss declining the gambit on this move or returning the pawn on the next move. The most important positional lessons proceed from its acceptance. 4 •.. a6 5 bxa6 .Bxa6 In the early years of the gambit, it wasn't re- alized that 5 ... g6 is more accurate, for reasons that are explained in the next game. 6 liJc3 d6 7 liJf3 When White tries to use this knight to bolster his queenside, its passive position allows Black to make a central break. Gross-Benko, Aspen 1968 is a good introduction to the gambit's character: 7 e4 .ixfl 8 ~xfl g6 9 g3 (9 liJf3 transposes to the game) 9 ... .Bg7 10 ~g2 O-O (here we have the standard formation that we discuss in the main game) llliJge2!? iVb6 12 l:tbl liJa6 13 b3 liJc7 14 f3 (everything looks solid enough) 14 ... e6! (D). This is a major Benko Gambit theme that we don't often see because in most modern systems, White takes care to prevent it! The game went 15 dxe6 fxe6 16 .Be3 'ifc6!

What is Black's compensa- tion for the pawn? It turns out that there are many factors; initially, we can identify these: a) He is ahead in development. Apart from his bishop and knight, his rook on a8 is devel- oped on a useful half-open file. b) Black's undeveloped pieces have conve- nient and active squares to go to: his bishop on g7 will be a powerful, unopposed piece, his queen's knight can go to d7, and his king's rook and queen can occupy the b- and/or a-files. c) Black can put serious pressure on White's queenside pawns, especially with his g7-bishop bearing down on c3 and b2. The Benko pawn- structure is particularly instructive because it shows how unobstructed a- and b-pawns can so easily be rendered immobile. This occurs in other openings, even when the pawns are passed (i.e., in the absence of an enemy c-pawn), as long as they are on half-open files. In the Benko Gambit, White's b-pawn advance creates a hole on a3 and target on a2, whereas if his a-pawn steps forward, that forms a weak square on b3 and makes it easier to attack b2. One extra possibility for Black is to capture White's knight on c3 in a situation where White has to play bxc3. The idea is to create a further weakening of White's pawn-structure because of the newly-isolated a-pawn, weak c-pawn, and attractive outposts for Black's pieces on c4, a4 and a3. Sometimes White will get compen- sation in the form of weakened dark squares around Black's king, but in a number of posi- tions that won't have practical value. d) White's centre can sometimes be attacked by ... e6, which either gives Black a direct attack on dS if he gets to play ... exdS, or a broad and potentially mobile centre if he answers dxe6 with ... fxe6. This occurred in Gross-Benko above. e) In terms of defence, Black's pawn-struc- ture is weakness-free and his king is extremely unlikely to face attack. Importantly, White will have trouble marshalling enough forces to carry out his desired pawn-break e4-eS, because Black can aim so many pieces at that square. So, you may ask, why does White even bother to play against the Benko Gambit, given this array of inspiring features in his opponent's position? First, an extra pawn is nothing to sneer at. In addition, White has no overt weak- nesses in his pawn-structure; for all of Black's wonderfully-placed pieces, he still needs to at- tack something more times than it's defended, or to craft a pawn advance that breaks down his opponent's position. And while authors are de- scribing all the positive aspects of Black's situ- ation, they seldom mention that his queenside attack is based mainly upon piece-play; we know that such attacks are more difficult to bring to fruition than those which have the aid of pawn-breaks. It's true that Black sometimes has an opportunity to play ... fS or ... e6, but White can often prevent those moves or render them harmless. As we shall see, for example, neither of those moves is likely to be successful if White plays g3 and i.g2.
174 MASTERING THE CHESS OPENINGS
8e4 A major decision. White stakes out room in the centre, but loses the right to castle and cre- ates an interior weakness on d3. In the next game we shall see other ways of handling the position. 8 .•• .i.xfl 9 'it>xfl .i.g7 10 h3 At the time of this game, this was the most popular move. White stops ... ttJg4 and will 'cas- tle by hand', marching his king over to h2. The related 10 g3 O-O 11 'it>g2 ttJbd7 (D) was a main line of the Benko for some years, accounting for hundreds of master games. w It's worth seeing a few examples in order to illustrate the pluses and minuses of these two very similar set-ups. In doing so we shall be in- troduced to some basic themes of the Benko Gambit. Once White has moved his king to g2, he must decide whether to allow ... ttJg4-eS: a) Upon 12 .l:.el, 12 ... likaS is a good move, but the most thematic idea is 12 ... ttJg4, prevent- ing eS and bringing a black knight to eS, from where it watches over c4 and d3. That needn't be fatal, of course, and Black has to be wary of playing ... c4 (intending ... ttJd3), because he gives White access to his own d4-square with the possibility of ttJd4-c6. White can respond with piece-play or pawn-play: al) 13 .i.f4 ~aS 14 h3 ttJgeS IS ttJxeS ttJxeS 16 ~e2 .l:!.fb8 17 .l:r.acl (D). 17 .. :~a6!?

But 4 ... b4, closing the position, can sti- fle the play and make it difficult to open lines. b) 4 tbd2 has the simple idea e4, which shouldn't be too dangerous if Black quickly breaks up the centre via ... bxc4 and ... e6. White would rather have his knight on c3 in such posi- tions. c) 4 'iVc2 (D) is more subtle than 4 tbd2, still intending e4 but reserving the possibility of tbc3 and leaving a path to f4 or g5 open for his queen's bishop. Then Moskalenko suggests that the most important lines are:

vour of~c2, White now has a direct view of the f5-square) l1...tbb6 12 b3! tbxc4 13 bxc4 is a structure worth remembering, since White's space, grip on d5 and superior minor pieces outweigh Black's bishop-pair. c2) 4 ... b4 5 e4 d6 6 f4! sets up a mobile cen- tre as in the King's Indian Four Pawns Attack. White intends tbf3, i.d3, O-O and/or tbbd2 in some order. c3) 4 ... tba6 5 tbc3 (or 5 a3) 5 ... bxc4 6 e4 tbb4 (6 ... e6 7 i.xc4) 7 'iVa4! e6 8 i.xc4 i.b7 9 i.g5 i.e7 10 i.xf6 i.xf6 11 tbge2 with the idea of a3; again, delaying tbf3 proved useful. c4) 4 ... e65 e4 exd5 (5 ... bxc4 transposes to 'c1') 6 cxd5 c4 7 tbc3 with a small advantage for White. d) 4 tbf3 (D) is arguably the most signifi- cant attempt to get the better game by purely positional means. Then 4 ... e6!? is the Blumenfeld Gambit, af- ter which 5 i.g5 is an older main line, but I be- lieve that 5 dxe6 fxe6 6 cxb5 should, with care, give White an advantage. The usual responses to 4 tbf3 are: dl) 4 ... bxc4, when 5 tbc3 and 6 e4 is com- fortable for White, although playable for Black. d2) 4 ... i.b7, when among other ideas, 5 tbbd2 bxc4 6 e4 and 5 'iWc2 tba6 are critical.

Considerable theory is attached to 4 ctJf3, and players on both sides of this opening will benefit from its investigation. 4 ... a6 (D) w 5 bxa6 Acceptance is the principled move, but White has some important alternatives here such as 5 b6, 5 f3 and 5 e3.

To keep this coverage fairly concise, I'll refer you to more specialized sources.

... g6! (D) Of all the move-order nuances in the Benko If Black plays 5 ... i.xa6 (as he did in many of the early games with this variation, including the previous one), it turns out that White can defend effectively by fianchettoing both bish- ops: 6 g3 d6 (6 ... g6 7 b3) 7 i.g2 g6 8 b3! i.g7 9 i.b2 O-O 10 ctJh3 and 11 O-O. Experience has shown that, with Black's g7-bishop neutral- ized, he will have a relatively more difficult time achieving counterplay against White's queenside. Compare the next note. w 6 ctJc3 Here, however, the line 6 b3 i.g7 7 i.b2 O-O

... O-O.
Why is White taking two moves to put his bishop on a square (g2) where it is blocked by its own d-pawn? There are a few reasons for do- ing so, ones which should be more comprehen- sible when you have been through the material in the previous game: a) He gets to castle, a lUxury not afforded by the lines involving e4. b) He doesn't create any internal weaknesses such as the one on d3 that the move e4 pro- duces. c) He discourages the move ... e6, which we have seen can break up White's centre and es- tablish a mobile central pawn-mass. Now ... e6 is still conceivable, but will be an exceptional occurrence because dxe6 will extend the range of White's bishop along the long diagonal. d) Now that it isn't doing much useful work, White may actually profit from the presence of Black's bishop on a6. In fact, Neil McDonald goes so far as to say that White's bishop on g2 is in general a better piece than Black's on a6! His point is that the latter piece has nowhere partic- ularly useful to go, and in fact it gets in the way of Black's attempts to threaten White along the a-file or occupy a6 with another piece. That may sound rather abstract, but you will see that in key variations below, Black's favourite and probably best move is ... i..c8! Of course, Black mustn't be too upset with the passive position of White's bishop on g2; he should get on with his queenside play. That generally means ... O-O, ... 'iVa5 and ... .t:tfb8, as in the previous game, but he also has ideas of a well-timed ... ttJb6 in order to attack d5 and en- courage White to move his queenside pawns. 10lIbi It's remarkable how this simple move turned a previously humdrum line into White's favour- ite variation against the Benko Gambit. Granted, White's move is useful: it protects b2 and re- moves the rook from indirect attack from the bishop on g7. But the key factor is that White can play b3 at the right moment. And that's where timing comes in. In the past, White had played 10 O-O with the idea 10 ... O-O lll:!.bl, but he found himself confronted with 1O ... ttJb6!
(D).
w This causes problems with the simultaneous protection of d5 and the queenside; for exam- ple, if White now plays IIl:!.bl !?, he has to deal with 11 ... i..c4, which attacks both d5 and a2. At least that's how theory explains it. Actually, you might want to take this a bit further and see how the position plays out after, say, 12 ttJg5; I'm not sure whether this is as harmless as its lack of coverage suggests.

This move keeps Black's pieces out of c4 and a4, while in some cases preparing i..b2. Now if Black plays ... c4, White will reply b4, establishing two connected passed pawns on the queenside and making the bishop look silly on a6. Nevertheless, Black has returned to this position with some new ideas and it is still be- ing disputed today: a) 1l...i..b7 (attacking dS) 12 tiJh4!

2004. The e4/dS structure is fine as long as
Black has no access to White's internal weak- nesses, and here the bishop on b2 neutralizes that on g7. b) 1l...i..c8!? (D) has the idea ... i..fS. If White prevents that with 12 e4?!, 12 ... i..a6! will bring us back to a familiar type of position in which Black has prevented castling and can target d3. A good illustration is 13 i..f1 'iVc8 14 i..d2 O-O IS i..xa6 ~x a6 16 'IV e2 tiJe8! 17 a4 'iVxe2+ 18 ~xe2 fS!, as in Cvitan-Matamoros, Cannes 1996, when White will have to give back his d-pawn and leave Black with a 2:0 central majority. Nevertheless, this exotic strategy (. .. i..c8-a6) is in itself proof of the efficacy of White's place- ment of his bishop on g2, in that Black's bishop on a6, so powerful in other variations, feels obliged to retreat to its home square so long as White hasn't moved his e-pawn. This corre- sponds with McDonald's observation above about the relative strengths of the two sides' light-squared bishops. Instead of 12 e4, White should move his f3-knight, and there seems to be a pleasant choice: bI) 12 tiJh4 h6 (D). w Black intends 13 ... gS and ... i..fS, forcing a response: bll) 13 'iic2 'iVd7!

White's pieces are coordinating better than in Cvitan-Matamoros above. His knight on d2 and bishop on b2 are unusually well-placed.

However, if an opening survives its initial challenges, which the Benko Gambit certainly has, it tends to sur- vive later ones, so we'll see what the future holds. This chapter has described a range of gam- bits from the directly attacking to the posi- tional. In my opinion, every developing player should try to incorporate one of each type into his repertoire, if only as an optional weapon. 6 f-Pawns and Reversed Openings This chapter re-opens the topic of reversed openings, which I've already discussed at some length in the context of the English Opening in Volume 3, and to a lesser extent in other places (for example, 1...b6 and 1 b3 in Chapter 4 of this volume). A reversed opening usually refers to a case in which White plays an opening best known as a black defence, hoping to exploit the advantage of his extra move. Sometimes Black plays what is normally a white opening with a tempo less; this is the case with a couple of the double e-pawn variations I'll mention below. Obviously, for White to gain a tempo on a known variation will more often be attractive than for Black to playa known variation with a tempo less. Even so, since white systems on av- erage sport a somewhat higher evaluation than black ones, their adoption with a tempo less will not necessarily lead to a disadvantage. Up to this point in the series, I've examined openings in which the first pawn move is made by the b-, C-, d-, e- or g-pawn. In this chapter, I'm beginning with a discussion of the ne- glected f-pawn openings, namely, 1 ... f5 (the Dutch Defence, played versus 1 d4 or 1 c4), and
1 f4 (the Bird Opening). The Dutch has a sto-
ried history of use by elite players, and numer- ous devoted grandmaster advocates today. The Bird, although it has never been played exten- sively at grandmaster level, has a respectable master following and is undergoing a modest revival. I'll devote most of this chapter to a seri- ous investigation of this opening duo. Then I look at the King's Indian Attack in the context of reversed openings, since it is the other side of the King's Indian Defence coin. Finally, I touch rather lightly upon some examples of reversed openings that stem from I e4 e5; hopefully they are instructive in their own right. The study of reversed openings will increase your understanding of what can and cannot be achieved in openings. Many chess-players are mathematically oriented, with a facility for logical thinking. So it's only natural to assume that there must be some way to make use of an extra move. After all, chess moves have value, and you wouldn't voluntarily give a move away under normal circumstances. However, as we've talked about throughout these vol- umes, the worth of an extra move isn't a straight- forward matter. In reversed positions of the English Opening, for example, it's remarkable how seldom White can actually claim to have the better game. For one thing, any advantage is limited by the fact that he will usually be play- ing what are essentially defensive or counterat- tacking lines. In addition, there's a paradoxical benefit in not having to move, in that Black gets a better look at what his opponent is up to and is able to react accordingly. Thus White's strat- egy will be to try to gain something from his ex- tra move without compromising his position, and Black will try to make use of the extra in- formation revealed by that move. It sometimes happens that, if White isn't careful, he will ac- tually end up in a worse position than if he hadn't had the extra move at all! Stepping outside the practical realm, this dif- ficulty (of converting a move into something of value) is also revealing about the nature of chess itself. The paradox of information applies to every move, whether in a reversed position or not. In some sense, however sound and logical a move is, it contains the risk of leaving you worse off! That enormously magnifies the com- plexity and subtlety of the game. If advantages and disadvantages were additive in some linear fashion, chess would be a minor game at best. But we have geniuses who do little else but study and play chess from the time they are five years old into their forties, and they make mul- tiple mistakes in nearly every game, often quite serious ones! As an exercise, set up a reversed opening and try to find ways to make even mod- est improvements in your position without de- stabilizing something elsewhere on the board. You'll find that the most trivial-seeming change
I-PAWNS AND REVERSED OPENINGS 183
always seems to show up in one or another line of analysis where you're least expecting it. When you see how such a straightforward task (concentrating on only a single move) can en- tangle you in a whole complex of issues, it helps you appreciate how deep and impenetra- ble chess really is. Returning to the task before us, and before moving on to specific examples, you need to know which reversed openings are fit for inclu- sion in your repertoire. The simplest criterion is subjective: do you enjoy playing the opening in question? Strictly speaking, that's not neces- sary, but it is certainly helpful. Two other con- siderations present themselves:
1. Is the opening objectively good? For ex-
ample, let's assume that you're playing White and reversing a standard black defence; will the opening produce any advantage against accu- rate play? Does White, with a tempo more, risk ending up in a more exposed position than Black does with a tempo less?
2. If the reversed opening that White is using
doesn't produce any advantage, will it never- theless cause practical difficulties for Black? That is, are there easy ways for Black to equal- ize against it, or will he be confronted with problems to solve even after the opening phase is over? It's worth noting that the answer to this question also determines whether White plays a particular 'mainstream' opening. That is, since Black can ultimately equalize against most if not all openings, White will want to choose openings which exert lasting pressure. In con- ventional thinking, that would explain the high- level use of the Ruy Lopez (1 e4 e5 2 tbf3 tbc6 3 i.b5) rather than the Scotch Game (3 d4), the Vienna Game (2 tbc3) or any of the double e- pawn gambits. Arguably, all of these openings draw with perfect play. Similarly, among strong players, you largely see White's choice of the Queen's Gambit after 1 d4 d5. That is, he plays
2 c4 (or 2 tbf3 and 3 c4), rather than 2 tbc3 or 2
e3, or 2 tbf3 with 3 i.f4. It's not that Black can't ultimately equalize in any mainstream opening; it's that against the better ones he is confronted with serious challenges and, having solved them, is still left with a complex struggle to conduct. On a practical level, this can have additional benefits such as tiring out your oppo- nent or putting him in time-trouble. Having said all that, let's move to our first set of reversed openings. Dutch Defence/Bird Opening
1 d4 f5 (D)
W
The Dutch Defence is a traditional and es- sentially sound opening which nevertheless re- quires precise treatment on Black's part. At the grandmaster level, therefore, it is primarily the province of loyal specialists. But for the aver- age player and even the master, the Dutch can be a particularly effective weapon. In part, that's due to a potential imbalance in knowledge be- tween opponents: most 1 d4 and 1 c4 players will allot only limited time to study of the Dutch, placing a higher priority upon much more frequently-played openings such as the Queen's Gambit and Indian systems. This situ- ation suits Black, all the more so if he applies himself to mastering the general ideas and con- crete variations of 1...f5. Black has three primary set-ups in the Dutch Defence. The Classical System includes the moves ... f5, ... tbf6, ... e6, ... i.e7, ... O-O and ... d6; the Leningrad System combines ... f5, ... tbf6, ... g6, ... i.g7, ... O-O and ... d6; and the Stonewall System consists of the moves ... f5, ... tbf6, ... e6, ... d5 and ... c6. I'll mainly concentrate upon the first two of these and discuss the Stonewall in less detail at the end of this section. The rare Antoshin System involves the moves ... tbf6, ... d6, ... c6, ... 'ilic7 and ... e5. Black's develop- ment suffers in this case, so he generally ends up in a somewhat inferior position; I'll have to
184 MASTERING THE CHESS OPENINGS
refer you to the standard remedies in theoretical works. The Dutch Defence can be thought of as a mirror image of the Sicilian Defence. In partic- ular, we see that if White plays e4 in the Dutch Defence, .. .fxe4 gives Black a central majority and a half-open f-file, just as in the Open Sicil- ian with, e.g., 1 e4 c5 2lbf3 d6 3 d4 cxd4, Black obtains a central majority and a half-open c- file. In the Dutch, Black's first goal is usually to achieve ... e5, whereas in the Sicilian, a success- ful ... d5 usually denotes equality or better. Take the position after the following se- quence:
1 d4 f5 2 g3 lbf6 3 li.g2 e6 4 c4 li.e7 5 lbf3
O-O 6 O-O d6 7 lbc3 ~e8 8 :tel ~g6 9 e4 fxe4 10 lbxe4lbxe411ltxe4lbc612l:.e1li.f6 (D) w ... and compare it with this common structure and piece placement for Black in the Sicilian Defence:
1 e4 c5 2 lbfJ d6 3 d4 cxd4 4 lbxd4 lbf6 5
lbc3 lbc6 6 li.e2 e6 7 O-O li.e7 8 li.e3 li.d7 9 ~h1 lbxd4 10 li.xd4 li.c6 11 'iVd3 O-O 12 f4 ~a5 (D) First, note that in all variations of the Dutch Defence, since Black plays ... d6 or ... d5 at some point, he will have a weakness on e6. Similarly, in the Open Sicilian (with 3 d4 cxd4 4lbxd4), assuming that Black plays either ... e6 or ... e5, he adopts a weakness on d6 (that applies to most variations, although not in the Dragon and Accelerated Dragon). In the Dutch, Black will generally have to castle kingside, i.e., on the same side of the board as his weakness, and he will lack the natural protection that a pawn on f7 affords a castled king. In the Sicilian Defence, w Black's corresponding weakness on d6 is fur- ther away from his normal king placement on g8, and all three kingside pawns remain on the second rank, guarding their charge. A comparison of flank attacks is also reveal- ing. After the exchange on d4 in the Sicilian Defence, Black has a potentially strong minor- ity attack on the queenside via ... b5-b4. In both the Classical and Leningrad Dutch, after an eventual e4 and ... fxe4, Black's advance of his kingside minority exposes his king. Neverthe- less, by the time White plays e4, Black's f- pawn in the Dutch Defence can sometimes as- sist a serious kingside attack by ... f4, often in conjunction with ... g5. As White's most popu- lar and arguably most promising lines nearly all stem from playing g3, li.g2 and O-O, this kingside advance, combined with moves such as ... 'iWh5, ... li.h3 and ... lbg4, can cause consid- erable havoc in White's camp. I should mention that in the Classical Variation ( ... lbf6, ... e6, ... d6 and ... li.e7), Black can also playa sort of waiting game with moves such as ... c6, ... a5 and ... lba6, delaying both ... e5 and ... g5. This time there is no analogy in the Open Sicilian, since d41. .. cxd4 has already been played; whereas, when playing Black in the Closed Sicilian, there would be no point in delaying both ... d5 and ... b5 in favour of risky moves like ... f6, ... h5 and ... lbh6. From White's point of view, the two most im- portant differences between these openings are: 1) In the Sicilian, he usually attacks in the centre and on the kingside; in the Dutch, he at- tacks in the centre and queens ide. 2) In the Sicilian, his centre is typically un- der attack from ... lbf6 and the likes of ... b5-b4,

... Jtb7 and ... liJbd7-c5; it is also subject to radi- cal transformation from the move ... e5. In the Dutch, his c4/d4 centre tends to be fairly se- B cure, particularly since ... g5-g4 is a risky ven- ture; and the move ... d5 is not a realistic option in most positions (with a few important excep- tions). Needless to say, most strong players feel that the trade-offs for the Sicilian Defence are worth it as Black, whereas fewer are willing to adopt the Dutch Defence. Nevertheless, the compari- son is useful for identifying the underlying fea- tures of both openings. Leningrad Dutch Beliavsky - Malaniuk USSR Ch, Moscow 1983

I'll concentrate upon this move in all varia- tions; White plays g3 and Jtg2 in a large major- ity of all Dutch Defence lines. On an obvious level, this supports White's ideal break e4, which will open lines for White in classical fashion. Another factor is that, with pressure on b7, Black will have to be careful in develop- ing his queen's bishop. In some cases, it's im- portant that White's attack on d5 makes the move ... d5 itself more difficult for Black to play, whereas the moves ... c5 and ... e5 can sometimes weaken d5 and the centre. Finally, whether or not Black plays ... c6, the bishop on g2 supports the advance b4-b5, just as it does in the English Opening. Not surprisingly, there's more to this move, but that's best shown by ex- ample. Instead, the natural move 2 c4 can transpose, or White can go his own way. Perhaps the main sequence that Black should avoid is 2 ... liJf6 (2 ... g6?! 3 h4!, when 3 ... Jtg7 4 h5 is annoying, while 3 ... liJf6?! 4 h5! liJxh5 5 .:txh5 gxh5 6 e4 is worse still; compare the rest of this note) 3 liJc3 g6 (3 ... d6! with ... g6 next avoids the fol- lowing problem) 4 h4! Jtg7 5 h5!, intending 5 ... liJxh5 6 e4! (D). Now there is no ideal defence against White's threats of 7 .:txh5 and 7 exf5; for example, 6 ... liJf6 (6 ... e6 7 exf5 exf5 8 .:txh5 gxh5 9 'iVxh5+ 'it>f8 10 liJd5 with a huge attack, threat- ening both 'iVxf5+ and Jtg5, to begin with) 7 exf5 gxf5 8 Jtg5 (or 8 Jtf4 d6 9 'iic2 and O-O-O; or even 8 liJh3 intending liJf4; in every case, White's half-open h-file facing Black's weak- ened kingside gives White some advantage) 8 ... 0-09 'iVd2 d6 100-O-O, and White has more than enough for a mere pawn. Always be aware of this h4-h5 possibility. 2 ... d6 Sometimes Black uses this particular niove- order in order to discourage liJh3 lines (see be- low). Instead, 2 ... g6?! 3 h4! presents the kind of difficulties seen in the previous note. So the conventional move-order is 2 ... liJf6 3 Jtg2 g6
(D).

Then apart from the normal4liJf3 Jtg7 5 O-O d6, transposing to the game, White has: a) 4 liJh3, intending liJf4 followed by d5. After 4 ... Jtg7 5 liJf4, a common defence is 5 ... liJc6, intending ... e5. After 6 d5liJe5, Black's knight can't easily be dislodged from e5; a typi- cal continuation is 7liJc3 c6 8 e4 fxe4 (8 ... d6 is also playable) 9 liJxe4 liJxe4 10 Jtxe4 cxd5 11

.ltxdS e6 12 .ltg2 O-O with chances for both sides. b) Alternatively, White can play 4 c3!? with the idea of'iVb3, which both attacks b7 twice and prevents Black from castling; for example, 4 ... .ltg7 S lDh3 O-O? 6 'iVb3+ and 7 .ltxb7. Black usually resorts to ... e6 and/or ... dS at some point in order to get castled, with which he has achieved respectable results. I won't say more about these deviations, but they will repay some study. 3lDf3 Now 3 .ltg2lDf6 4lDh3 (with the idea 4 ... g6 SlDc3, looking to play dS and lDf4) 4 ... eS! de- nies White's knight access to f4, and Black has no problems following S dxeS dxeS 6 ~xd8+ ..to>xd8. Of course, there are options other than S dxeS, but Black should come out all right be- cause White's knight is poorly placed on h3. 3 ••• g6 4 .ltg2 .ltg7 5 O-O lDf6 (D) w This is the Leningrad Dutch formation for Black, distinguished by the fianchetto of Black's king's bishop. It is the choice of most modem players, although the Classical and Stonewall Variations are still important. An optimist might argue that the Leningrad Dutch is an improved version of the King's Indian Defence, because in the King's Indian, Black ends up moving his king's knight in order to advance his f-pawn, whereas in the Leningrad Dutch, the pawn is al- ready on that square! Naturally there are some limitations to that argument, but it's true that Black initially has more direct control of the centre due to the move .. .fS, and ifhe can carry out ... eS (almost always a major goal, especially in the Classical and Leningrad Variations), the companionship of his pawn on fS increases the possibility of a productive central advance. 6c4

6 ...O-O 7lDc3 (D) 7 ...' iVeS This is the modem main line of the Lenin- grad Dutch, replacing the moves 7 ... c6 and 7 ... lDc6, which used to be considered the only two respectable choices. Those moves are still important choices, of course, but I'll stick with the queen move so as to cover the essential practical details. The Leningrad Dutch is a pop- ular system and, like others, has a massive body of theory attached to it. Why 7 ... 'iVe8? It's really a matter of timing and specifics. The threat of an early ... eS limits White, who has to prevent Black from equaliz- ing with that advance, and it turns out that transferring Black's queen to the kingside (usu- ally by ... 'ii'hS) can have real benefits. Black also keeps his options open, as can be seen in the next few notes. Finally, he has a concrete defence in mind versus 8 :tel, which you will see in the game following this one. S d5 (D) White's two main strategies in the Leningrad Variation involve this central advance dS and the break e4, seen in the next game. The older move 8 lDdS has failed to produce any advan- tage after either 8 ... lDa6 or 8 ... lDxdS 9 cxdS ~bS 10 lDgS h6 11 lDh3 eS. After 8 dS, if White can play lDd4 and then enforce the opening of the e-file, the weakness on e6 will be of decisive importance. He also has the idea ofb4, .ltb2 and, at the right moment,

c5. Playing b4 has the additional benefit of dis- couraging Black from ... c6 because of dxc6 fol- lowed by b5. On the negative side, 8 d5 opens the al-h8 diagonal for Black's bishop and gives him squares on c5 and e5 upon which to put knights. White's advance is also very committal and thus allows Black to focus upon a narrower set of problems than would be presented by a more flexible move. 8 ... ttJa6 8 ... a5 is the main alternative. It forestalls White's b4 expansion on the queenside (which is a plan that can cause Black considerable dis- comfort following 8 ... ttJa6), and in doing so it secures a post on c5 for Black's queen's knight. Now 9.l:tbl is rather slow after 9 ... ttJa6 10 b3 .i.d7 (versus ttJb5) 11 .i.b2 ttJc5 12 e3 c6. White has any number of other replies, includ- ing 9 .i.e3, 9 ttJel and 9 .i.d2. I'll limit myself to 9 ttJd4, which is the most thematic move, as it covers e6 and opens up the possibility of e4. Black replies with 9 ... ttJa6 (D).

a) 10 b3 .i.d7 11 .i.b2 g5! saves Black a tempo, because in other lines he usually has to play ... h6 and ... g5, the former move contribut- ing little to his plans. One instructive variation goes 12 e3 f4! 13 exf4 gxf4 14 ttJe6 .i.xe6 15 dxe6 c6 16 ttJe2?! fxg3 17 hxg3? ttJg4!, when White has problems in the face of ... ~h5. After 18 .i.h3 .i.xb2 White has to give up a pawn by 19l:!.bl ttJxf2 20 l:txf2, etc., because 19 .i.xg4? .ltxal 20 ~xal ~g6 21 .i.h3 'iVh5! costs him more material. b) 10 e4 fxe4 11 ttJxe4 ttJxe4 12 .i.xe4 .i.h3 13 l:tel (or 13 .ltg2) 13 ... ttJc5 14 .i.hl Wif7 15 .lte3 .l:tae8 (15 ... .ltd7!? prepares ... c6, not nec- essarily immediately) 16 'iVd2 e5 17 dxe6 ttJxe6 18 ttJxe6 .i.xe6 19 .l:.tac1 b6 with equality, Van der Sterren-Nikolic, Ter Ape11994. Naturally, there's more to be said here, but White should probably look into his 9th-move alternatives. 9 ttJd4 9 .lte3 isn't bad (compare the reversed posi- tion in the Bird Opening, where it equalizes). But the most important alternative to 9 ttJd4 is 9 l:tbl (D), which removes White's rook from the long diagonal and prepares b4, both capturing territory and restricting Black's pieces.

In this case, Black almost always gives up his kingside plans for the moment and plays on the queenside with ... c6 or ... c5.

If4 (D) The Bird Opening has never had a steady fol- lowing at grandmaster level. For most players, its main drawback is that Black doesn't have to work hard enough to reach equality. In most openings, White has an initial advantage that persists for a while and requires accurate han- dling from Black in order to achieve equality. The Bird Opening doesn't present that level of challenge. In addition, some players are reluc- tant to deal with the From Gambit, I f4 e5 2 fxe5 d6, which takes the initiative away from White in the first few moves. Having said that, I f4 is perfectly respectable from a theoretical point of view and, along with other unorthodox openings, has been receiv- ing renewed attention. Today's players have an understandable desire to get away from 'theory' once in a while; that's not always pos- sible in standard openings because the most interesting systems include at least a few very lengthy variations which need to be memo- rized. By contrast, there are few truly critical variations involved if you pick a repertoire based upon I f4. The From Gambit is one of them: you have to study it (or play 2 e4, trans- posing to the King's Gambit). But this gambit has been looking increasingly shaky versus accurate play by White, and the relevant the- ory isn't too difficult to absorb (see the next note). The other lines that you'll probably want to master are those that stem from I f4 d5, a re- versed Dutch Defence. For one thing, statistics show that you will see 1.. .d5 far more often than any other reply. Although you can always avoid playing reversed Dutch positions, it's more promising and instructive to take up the challenge and see what you can do with your extra move. In fact, many I f4 players also use the Dutch Defence, so the two openings can reinforce one another.
192 MASTERING THE CHESS OPENINGS
In the first two games, I'm going to look at the reversed Leningrad Dutch variations, deal- ing primarily with the main lines. At the same time, there are many early options, and I'll try to supply enough background details so that you can get a feel for how the opening breaks down in general, and which lines might appeal to you when playing either colour.
1...d5
Obviously, Black can do without ... dS and thus side-step a main-line Dutch Defence posi- tion; for example: a) Black can contest the critical eS-square by 1...d6!?, with the idea 2 ttJf3 iLg4. Upon 2 e4, Black might play into a line of the f4 Sicil- ian by 2 ... cS, a King's Gambit Declined by 2 ... eS or choose a Pirc set-up with 2 ... ttJf6 3 ttJc3 g6 (or here 3 ... iLg4!?). You can imagine how many independent move-orders can result from this or other slow first moves. That's be- cause 1 f4 puts so few demands upon Black. b) The naturall...ttJf6 is another example: after 2 ttJf3, it can transpose to a reversed Dutch after 2 ... dS. Alternatively, Black can play 2 ... cS, 2 ... g6, 2 ... b6 or another noncom- mittal move. The position is practically uncon- strained, which is the reason so many games with the Bird Opening leave the beaten track earlyon. c) 1...ttJh6!? (D) is a curious way to get to unique positions. w This resembles variations of the Dutch De- fence in which White plays ttJh3.

Here are a few thoughts about theory, featur- ing some practical approaches: dl) 4 ... ttJf6 can be answered by the slightly unusual S ttJc3 (recommended by Larsen; the main line S d4 ttJg4 6 ~d3 cS 7 'iVe4+ is a bit hard to assess; for example, after the recom- mended 7 ... iLe7 8 e3 0-09 iLd3 fS 10 iLc4+ 'iii>h8 11 'ilVd3, l1...f4! 120-0 ttJc6 offers com- pensation; S e3 opens another can of worms following S ... ttJg4 6 'iVe2) S ... ttJg4 6 g3!; for example, 6 ... hS (6 ... ttJxh2 7 J::!.xh2 iLxg3+ 8 .l:tf2 has been analysed at some length and seems to favour White) 7 ttJe4 h4 8 gxh4 (8 ttJxd6+ ~xd6 9 gxh4 ttJc6 10 d3 is recom- mended by Vigus) 8 ... iLfS (8 ... iLe7 9 ttJegS .1:.xh4 is rather slow after 10 d4! .l:.hS 11 h3; for example, 11...ttJc6 12 'iVd3) 9 ttJxd6+ ~xd6

Then: el) 2 e4 transposes to a Sicilian Defence sideline (1 e4 c5 2 f4), but that allows the well- known 2 ... d5! 3 exd5 liJf6 with the idea 4 c4 e6!, a gambit in which Black gets at least enough compensation after 5 dxe6 i.xe6. Note that White has holes on d4 and d3, while if he plays d3, then e3 becomes weak as well. What with good development and pressure down the d-file against White's backward pawn, most people prefer to play Black. e2) White typically continues 2liJf3 liJc6 3 g3 (3 e4 d5!? is again worth considering: 4 exd5 'fiIxd5 5liJc3 and 5 ...

Please forgive me a digression here. This idea of ... d6 to cover e5 comes up with reversed colours in the English Opening version of the Stonewall Dutch if Black is not very careful with his move-order: 1 c4 f5 2liJf3 liJf6 3 g3 e6 4 i.g2 d5 5 O-O c6?! 6 d3 (D).

194 MASTERING THE CHESS OPENINGS
w 2 ttJf3 Naturally White can set up in numerous ways, such as 2 d3 or 2 e3, but it's probably worth delaying a fianchetto: a) 2 g3 h5 3 ttJf3 h4! is a theme we've seen before, with the idea 4 ttJxh4? J:lxh4! 5 gxh4 e5. Black will have a pawn for the exchange, as well as an attack and an ideal centre after 6 .llg2 'iVxh4+ 7 ~fl 'iVxf4+ 8 ~gl ttJf6. b) 2 b3 .llg4!? is a clever move, reversing White's line 1 d4 f5 2 .llg5 versus the Dutch. Here Black is a tempo down, but the extra move b3 will sometimes hurt White's position. Just for example, the tempting 3 h3?! .llh5 4 g4 e6! threatens ... 'iVh4# (here 4 ... e5 5:th2!? ~h4+ 6 :tf2 is unclear). Play can continue 5 .llg2 (5 ttJf3 .llg6 6 .llb2 c5 7 .llg2 ttJc6 gives Black a greater share of the centre and a good chance of playing ... d4 at some point, cutting off the b2- bishop) 5 ... ~h4+ 6 ~fl.llg6 7 ttJf3 'iVf6!, forc- ing the weakening 8 d4, and thus pointing to a drawback ofb3. We now return to 2 ttJf3 (D):

2 ••• ttJf6 2 ... g6 will be seen in the following game. A couple of alternatives in brief: a) 2 ... ttJc6 parrots the popular line 1 d4 f5 2 ttJc3. This seems an acceptable choice after 3 g3 (naturally 3 d3 and 3 e3 are playable; after 3 b3 .llg4 4 .llb2, 4 ... d4 cuts into White's ambi- tions) 3 ... .llg4 (3 ... g6 4 .llg2 .llg7) 4 .llg2 'iVd7 (4 ... .llxf3 5 .llxf3 e5?! is too hurried after 6 c4! exf4 7 cxd5 ttJe5 8 'iia4+ 'iVd7 9 'iixf4) 5 d3 O-O-O!? 6 O-O!? h5 with dynamic play ahead. b) 2 ... .llg4 contemplates ... .llxf3, especially if that exchange can assist in achieving the move ... e5 with a central superiority: bl) 3 ttJe5 mimics the Trompowsky Attack move 1 d4 ttJf6 2 .llg5 ttJe4, and can lead to in- teresting positions after 3 ... .llh5. Then White should avoid 4 g4? e6 5 h4 f6 in favour of a line such as 4 c4 f6 5 'iVa4+ c6 6 ttJf3. Instead, 3 ... .llf5 and even 3 ... h5!? are reasonable alter- natives. b2) 3 e3 ttJd7 4 h3 (in response to 4 .te2, 4 ... c6 5 O-O .llxf3 6 .llxf3 e5 is one of a wide va- riety of defences; nevertheless, 4 .lle2 holds forth better long-term prospects than 4 h3) 4 ... .llxf3 5 'iVxf3 ttJgf6!?

off his bishop by ... e6. For example, 4 ... i..g7 S .Bd3 0-060-0 i..fS!? (instead, 6 ... b6 with the idea ... .Ba6 is a favourite anti-Stonewall tech- nique; Black is a tempo down on a normal line for White, but should still have decent chances) 7 i..xfS gxfS with complex play. White has a very bad bishop, but Black's own bishop on g7 has few prospects and it's hard to open lines. Sometimes White can play for g4. 3 ... g6 4 i..g2 i..g7 Having strolled through the initial moves, let's tum to a game. The move-order illustrates a couple of new ideas:
B
H. Danielsen - A. Petrosian Schwerin 1999
1 f4 d5 2lLlf3 g6 3 g3 i..g7 4 i..g2 (D)
4 ••• lLlf6 The following two moves by Black are ones sometimes played by White in the Leningrad Dutch: a) 4 ... lLlh6 with the idea ... lLlfS and some- times ... d4 is a legitimate alternative. In fact, when White plays lLlh3 in the reversed system, one of his problems is that Black will liquidate the centre and play ... eS with a rather dull equality. But in the Bird Opening, White would like to avoid that outcome on principle, and thus may not wish to prepare e4. One way to set up would be S O-OlLlfS 6 d3!? (6 e3 is less ambi- tious and anticipates playing e4 versus ... d4) 6 ... d4 7 c4 with the idea of lLla3-c2, covering e3 and expanding on the queenside by l:.bI and b4. In most cases, Black will play ... as, but has to decide whether to play ... cS and ... lLlc6, or ... lLlc6 alone. Then, in most lines, he will try to break with ... eS. This is a very technical line in which both sides should have fully-fledged play. b) 4 ... c6 can be slightly irritating for White. Play can continue: bI) S O-O 'iVb6+ attacks b2 twice and forces 6 d4, when White has a hole on e4. However, this is a structure which Black often plays in the reversed position, and rather more dou- ble-edged than it might at first seem. b2) White can also play S d3, when S ... 'fUb6 threatens b2 and intends ... lLlh6 followed by ... lLlg4 or ... lLlfS; these positions are playable for both sides. b3) S e3lLlf6 6 d3 O-O 70-0. White has vari- ous modes of development here such as 'fUe2 or lLlc3, usually followed by e4 at some point. With logical play, however, Black should reach equality. 50-0 c5 6 d3 (D)
B
6••. O-O
196 MASTERING THE CHESS OPENINGS
6 ... ltJc6 will transpose in most cases, but does make the move 7 ltJc3!? more appealing to White than usual: a) 7 ... O-O permits 8 e4; it's unclear how 8 ... dxe4 9 dxe4 comes out, but White has the better prospects for an edge. White can also play 8 a3, which anticipates the need for b4 and is consistent with the idea that follows. Finally, Bucker's suggestion 8 h3!? is another useful semi-waiting move, in that it assists White slightly in most possible continuations, without hurting him in any obvious way; however, com- pare 7 'ieelltJc6 8 h3 in the note to 7 c3 below. b) 7 ... d4 8ltJa4ltJd7 (contemplating an ex- change sacrifice with ... bS) 9 c4 (9ltJgS 'ViIIc7 10 fS!? is Lars Karlsson's idea, leading to exotic tactical play; this is fun to analyse) 9 ... O-O (D). w We've arrived at what amounts to a King's Indian Defence (the YugoslavlPanno Variation), but with colours reversed and White having the extra move f4! Perhaps not surprisingly, f4 has both good qualities (increased central control) and drawbacks (central weaknesses, potentially exploitable by ... eS). Morozevich-Svidler, Inter- net 1999 continued 10 e4!? (10 a3 with the idea l:tbl, i.d2 and b4 is another thematic approach) 1O ... dxe3 11 i..xe3 ltJd4 12 ~bl llb8 13 b4 ltJxf3+ 14 i.xf3 cxb4 IS J:i.xb4 b6 16 d4, and White may be slightly for preference because of his good centre, but that's not clear. 7 c3 A very flexible move-order; of course, ev- erything is committal in some way, and White does forfeit the possibility of ltJa3 and c4 in one go. He also foregoes 7 ltJc3, a traditional but somewhat less popular move in the reversed Dutch position. Then if Black plays 7 . ..tDC6, White might want to reply 8 h3, as suggested by Stefan Bucker. After the more conventional 7 'iiVel (analo- gous to the main line ... 'iee8 in the Leningrad Dutch), a similarly thought-provoking line is 7 ... ltJc6 8 h3!? (D).
B
In reversed positions, it's hard to make a use- ful move that doesn't also give Black some- thing in return. In fact, h3 is a move that White will almost always make in conjunction with 'ViIIel, since g4 and ~h4 (or ~g6) can follow and it's useful to prevent ... ltJg4 in many lines. As an exercise in reversed positions, let's see what might follow: a) 8 ... b6 9 ltJa3 (9 g4 looks premature in view of 9 ... hS! 10 gS ltJe8 11 e4ltJc7) 9 ... i.b7 (9 ... i.a6!? 10 g4) 10 e4 dxe4 11 dxe4 is dou- ble-edged. Now ll...eS!? 12 fS!? (12 fxeS? ltJxeS!) 12 ... gxfS (or 12 ... ltJd4 13 ltJh4 ltJhS with the idea 14 c3? ltJxg3!) 13ltJh4 is a stan- dard attacking scheme seen in the Closed Sicil- ian, King's Indian Attack, and various Botvinnik set-ups in the English Opening. For example, 13 ... fxe4?! (13 ... f4 14 gxf4ltJhS) 14 i.gSltJd4? ISl:!dl'Ville7 16l:!.xd4! exd4 17ltJfS and White wins (17 .. .'iVeS 18ltJc4). Still, there's a line in which White's pawn on h3, and new weakness on g3, can be a negative: b) 8 ... ltJd4! 9ltJxd4 (9ltJa3 is playable; for example, 9 ... ltJxf3+ 10 J:i.xf3 b6 11 e4 i.b7 12 eS ltJe8 13 l:!.f2 ~c8 with chances for both sides) 9 ... cxd4 10 'iVf2 (Black in the same posi- tion - without ... h6 - plays ... ~bS here, but White's equivalent 10 'i!Vb4 runs into 1O ... ltJhS!

8 ... d4 If White is a counterattacking Leningrad Dutch player, he will welcome this potential overextension and sharpening of the battle.

the other reversed system, with the idea ltJa3- c4 and i.d2. If Black plays ... b6 and ... i.a6, White's knight might come to b5. Again, how- ever, the committal moves 'iVei and a4 com- bine to give Black an opportunity that he doesn't get in the reversed position: 9 ... i.e6!, which is a safe enough deployment in any case, hits the newly weakened b3-square; for example, 10 ltJa3 (10 ltJbd2 not only weakens e3, but gets in the way of i.d2, so Black can play any useful move, such as 1O .. :iVc7 or 1O ... l:tb8) 1O ... i.b3 (or 1O .. :iVd7, since the usual II ltJg5 is weak in view of 11...i.b3) 11 ltJc4 i.xc4 12 dxc4 dxc3 13 bxc3 (13 'ii'xc3 ltJg4 and ... ltJd4) 13 ..

Of course, White's main idea in the Bird Opening is to get a complex battle, not necessarily a the- oretical edge. 10 i.d2ltJd5 Black continues as White does in the reversed position; this lets White target his d-pawn. 1O ... i.e6 is a noncommittal and arguably better move; White might even be able to force through M, but he's unlikely to get any advantage from a position in which he controls less territory. llltJc2 11 ltJc4 b5 (or Il...i.e6) 12 ltJce5 ltJxe5 13 ltJxe5 'iid6 gives Black no special problems. 1l• •• b5 12 cxd4 cxd4 13 'iVf2 'iVb6 (D) w A familiar sight.

7 ... h6!? With this move, Black anticipates a few pos- sibilities. Directly, he wants to eliminate the combination of d5 and lOg5. He is also plan- ning ... 'ii'e8, when ... g5 and ... ~h5 becomes a possibility; or, if he wants to play .. :iWf7, the move lOg5 won't be available. Finally, h7 can be a handy place to tuck the king away. Of course, the move 7 ... h6 neglects the cen- tre for the moment, which is a little bit risky. In place of it, Black can always play moves such as 7 ... c6 and 7 ... a5, the latter with an eye to- wards gaining space on the queenside. But his most frequent move is 7 ... 'ii'e8, which bears a closer look. Then 8 d5 e5! 9 dxe61Oc6 followed by ... .Bxe6 develops smoothly, with equal pros- pects. And after 81Obd2, 8 ... lOc6 with the idea of an early ... e5 is better than usual, even if it doesn't immediately guarantee Black an even game. Finally, White's normal-looking 8 c4 has various possible answers, including 8 ... lOa6!?, intending ... e5; then 9 d5 c5 keeps a knight from travelling to e6 via d4, and it is apparently premature for White to embark upon 10 lOg5 h6!? 11 lOe6 .Bxe6 12 dxe6, because 12 .. .llb8 with the idea ... lOc7xe6 and .. :iWc8 scoops up the pawn on e6 without apparent punishment. Given all that, White will often allow ... e5, but he needs to avoid a standard attacking theme that everyone should know, since it has appeared in hundreds of games like this one: 7 ... llVe 8 8 c4 lOa6 9 lOc3 e5 10 dxe5 dxe5 11 e4?! f4! 12 gxf41Oh5!

The point. Black's control of f4 is of enor- mous worth, as we see in many lines from a wide variety of openings.

Developing without getting in the way of the c8-bishop. Another function of this flexible move is to protect c7 against a potentiallOc3- b5/d5 by White. 10 lObd2 White makes it clear that his goal is to play e4. 10 •.. c6 Alternatively Black can play 1O ... g5 (D), which is a normal part of his plan, opening a path for his queen to h5 or g6.

The formation with ... e6, ... d6 and ... i.e7 is called the Classical Variation, or the Ilyin- Zhenevsky Variation. It gives Black a rather cramped but solid position. White's obvious plan is to break with e4 (or sometimes d5), and Black's response is first and foremost to re- strict the effectiveness of that advance. Then he can prepare ... e5 and/or tum his attention to a kingside attack. When we get to the reversed versions in the next game, we'll see that the

Classical lines are just as subject to the para- doxes of time and information as any other. 7•. JWe8 Bringing the queen to h5 is the standard ma- noeuvre in the Classical Dutch. Black has a number of other moves; for example, 7 ... tZ:\e4 and 7 ... c6. Of these, the modem 7 ... a5 is the most flexible. It has the idea of meeting 8 b3 tZ:\a6 9 i.a3 with 9 ... tZ:\b4!.

Out of the many, many possibilities, I'll give a quick overview of which lines might be the most important and/or capable of improve- ment: a) 8 ... tZ:\e4 has a fair reputation, but I think 9 tZ:\xe4 fxe4 10 tZ:\d2 d5 11 f3 should give White the nod; for example, 1l...i.f6 (ll...e3 12 tZ:\bl i.b4 13 l:tf1 dxc4 14 'iVc2 is miserable for Black after both 14 ... b5 15 a4 and 14 .. :~'b5 15 .i.xe3) 12 fxe4 .i.xd4+ 13 e3 i.b6 14 exd5 exd5 15 cxd5! with the idea tZ:\c4. b) 8 ... ~h5 9 e4 fxe4 10 tZ:\xe4 tZ:\xe4 11 l:.xe4 tZ:\c6 12 .i.f4 .i.f6 13 ~d2 'it>h8 14l:tael is already clearly better for White, who has the dual ideas of d5 and c5, Keres-Simagin, Mos- cow 1951. c) 8 ... ~g6 9 e4 (this thematic break doesn't lose a pawn due to a tactical trick on move 11; the rare 9 'ilYb3!? has a good record in practice and is worth a look; one idea behind it is that 9 ... tZ:\e4 10 tZ:\xe4 fxe4 11 tZ:\d2 makes it impos- sible for Black to hold on to his material with- out large concessions, whereas normal moves such as 9 ... c6 and 9 ... tZ:\c6 are well met by 10 d5) 9 .. .fxe4 10 tZ:\xe4 tZ:\xe4 11 l:txe4 tZ:\c6 (11...'iixe4?! 12 tZ:\h4 traps the queen, and while 12 ...

This is a case of White playing a reversed Nimzo-IndianiQueen's Indian complex, one in which his extra tempo is extremely valuable and has no serious downside. The correspond- ing reversed position would arise via 1 d4 lbf6

Stonewall Dutch Finally, let's get a feel for the Stonewall Dutch, without any pretence of being thorough. This venerable opening produced some classic bat- ties in the olden days, with Black trying to rip apart White's kingside. Today, we usually see it with a modem interpretation.

Black's move-order doesn't reveal which sys- tem he is heading for, which makes the follow- ing note significant. 4 t'iJf3 White commits to playing the main line against either the Classical or Stonewall, ac- cording to Black's preference. As in other Dutch variations, this knight can also go to h3 by, for example, 4 c4 dS 5 t'iJh3 c6 6 O-O iLd6 7 ii.f4

7 ... ii.e7!? (a shrewd idea: Black wants to show that White's knight has no good square other than f4, which is now occupied by his bishop; retreating loses time, but Black will gain it back if White moves his bishop again, and sometimes Black can play an effective ... gS) 8 t'iJc3 (obviously not the only move; upon 8 t'iJd2, Johnsen and Bern like 8 ... 'iVb6! with a double attack on d4 and b2; then 9 cxdS cxdS 10 t'iJb3 can be met by their suggestion 1O ... iLd7 11 :tel t'iJa6 intending ... iLa4 or ... iLbS, or 1O ... a5) 8 ... O-O 9 'ClVd3! t'iJa6 10 a3 t'iJc7 11 :tael. Black stands solidly, but White has more positive prospects. Actually, if Black wants to playa Stonewall Variation after 4 c4, he can· avoid such prob- lems with the clever move 4 ... c6. This is de- signed to prevent t'iJh3, since Black preserves the idea of booting the knight with ... d6 and ... eS; for example, 5 t'iJh3 iLe7 6 O-O O-O and now 7 t'iJf4 d6, or 7 t'iJd2 d6 intending an early ...eS. Instead, S t'iJf3 dS reverts to a normal Stonewall. 4 ... d5 5 O-O iLd6 This active move has largely overtaken the older S ... iLe7 in popUlarity, so we'll focus on it. S ... iLe7 is still viable, however, and might even have some surprise value. 6c4c6(D) w This is the starting position of the modem Stonewall Dutch. It has a rather anti-positional look to it, because Black's bishop on c8 is al- ready very bad (even if he achieved ... eS, the pawn on fS would be in its way). White also has the wonderful eS outpost available to his pieces. In view of this, it's not easy to explain why the Stonewall Dutch is a respectable de- fence at all, but let's tackle the issue of that bishop on c8 first. Kramnik, who has played the Stonewall, defends the honour of that piece with the simple statement that it is no worse than White's bishop on g2! By this he means that White's fianchettoed bishop has virtually no scope as it runs into the 'stone wall' of
i-PAWNS AND REVERSED OPENINGS 209
Black's pawns, which guard both e4 and d5 twice. In addition, White can hardly suppress the development of the c8-bishop forever. In nonnal practice, it will often come to b7 (or a6) after ... b6 or to h5 after ... .ltd7-e8. The activa- tion of this piece corresponds to what I think should be a chess mini-rule: that the earlier one assumes weaknesses or bad pieces, the more likely they are to be manageable problems, or not problems at all. As for that outpost on e5, it is indeed a nega- tive feature of Black's position. But in modern chess we can often accept a central weakness in return for other factors. For example, in the Sveshnikov Sicilian (and other variations of the Sicilian going back to the Boleslavsky), Black accepts a weakness on d5: 1 e4 c5 2ltJf3 ltJc6 3 d4 cxd4 4ltJxd4ltJf6 5 ltJc3 e5 6ltJdb5 d6 7 .ltg5 a6 8 ltJa3 b5 9 .ltxf6 gxf6 10 ltJd5
(D).
B
From this point, ignoring the details (which will be familiar to many players), White can in most cases only reinforce his outpost on d5 by moving his a3-knight to e3 via c2, completing an elaborate journey of six moves with that one piece. Black will usually put his good bishop on e6, from where it helps to contest the outpost. Returning to the diagram of the Dutch Stone- wall after 6 ... c6, we find that in practice, White will have to make a similarly arduous trip with his queen's knight if he wishes to reinforce e5; for example, by ltJa3-c2-el-d3. Black's bishop on d6 is analogous to his bishop on e6 in the Si- cilian. Furthennore, in the Sveshnikov, Black's bad bishop will go to g7 and he will work around the outpost on d5 by playing .. .f5. In the Stonewall, Black very often plays ... .ltb7 and ... c5. Well, it would be stretching things to claim too much for the analogy, because other factors in these positions obviously differ. But the Sicilian and Dutch Defences (whose first moves are mirror images of one another) share the principle that you can live with one signifi- cant enemy outpost in your midst. Finally, returning to the virtues of the Stone- wall Dutch, a black knight on e4 can be very powerful. True, that square isn't an outpost, as is White's e5, but White finds it difficult to ex- pel the intruder. If he plays, for example, ltJel and f3, then the pawn on f3 renders White's king's bishop particularly unimpressive, and a subsequent e4 has to be very carefully planned, because the d4-square can prove particularly vulnerable to ... c5 and ... e5 attacks. 7b3 White pursues his best-known strategy: to exchange Black's good bishop on d6 by means of .lta3 and thus strengthen his control of e5. He can also fortify that square by means of i..b2. Let me show two instructive battles be- ginning with 7 "iVc2 (the queen protects c4 from capture and potentially works along the c-file) 7 ... O-O (D), and now:

Johnsen and Bern designate 8 ... O-O as '?!', and in the game Kasparov-Short, Rapid match (game 1), London 1987, after 9 ~a3 ~xa3 10 tDxa3, they also disapprove of 1O ... tDbd7.

212 MASTERING THE CHESS OPENINGS
King's Indian Attack The King's Indian Attack is a simple system in- volving the moves ltJf3, g3, .ltg2, O-O and d3, which can be played against nearly any set-up by Black. In most cases, the moves ltJbd2 and e4 follow, and in fact some lower-rated players will make those moves without thinking. Lovers of chess and readers of Volume 2 un- derstand that the King's Indian Defence is one of the most popular and exciting of Black's defences. And yet the King's Indian Attack, which reverses the King's Indian and even gains an extra move for White, is rarely played by grandmasters, international masters, or na- tional masters, and its use is discouraged for most students by their teachers. That seems sur- prising at first, but by now you can probably guess what's going on: almost any logical de- fence by Black equalizes, all the more so ones that don't try for an advantage, and it's hard to find lines where White poses real problems to his opponent. That's not what White wishes for in the opening. Again, the standard characteristics of re- versed openings apply. First, Black is able to adjust to the new information that White gives him with his extra move, especially because the King's Indian Defence is mainly a reactive and counterattacking opening. It's worth noting in that regard that the defining moves of the King's Indian Attack (listed above) give White little direct control of the centre, nor even pieces with much scope; suddenly it's not so surpris- ing that strong players aren't interested in it! Incidentally, another such opening is the classical Colle system, which begins with the moves d4, ltJf3, e3, c3, ltJbd2, .ltd3/e2 and O-O in some order. It's practically unknown in mod- em grandmaster play. With reversed colours, assuming that the game begins 1 d4 d5, those moves make up the Semi-Slav, which is proba- bly Black's most popular and dynamic response to 1 d4 in today's chess, and is used by many of the world's elite! The same reasons apply: ver- sus the Semi-Slav, White has to play aggres- sively and allow sharp positions if he wants to claim any advantage. Against the Colle, by contrast, Black can equalize in any number of ways; after all, by move 7, White has managed to put only one pawn on the 4th rank and has given himself a bad bishop on c 1 which already can't move! Returning to the King's Indian Attack, we find that, much as with the BirdlDutch duo, Black needn't even play modestly to secure eqUality. Remarkably, he can use most of the formations that are main lines when White uses them with colours reversed, even though those are aggressive and committal. Let's look at some games and see how that can be. Larsen - Ljubojevic Bugojno 1978 1 ltJf3 d5 2 g3 c5 3 .ltg2 ltJc6 4 O-O e5 Black is cooperating by setting up a big cen- tre and daring White to use the attacking meth- ods employed in the King's Indian Defence. You can argue that if this doesn't favour White, no other logical defensive set-up by Black will. In reply, White might say that the King's Indian Attack, like the Bird Opening, is not designed to produce an advantage, but only a game with chances for both sides.
5 d3 .lte7
Black has a particular idea in mind that de- pends upon him not having the standard move ... ltJf6 in. In the next game, Black plays 5 ... ltJf6 and makes similar adjustments a few moves later.

next, he could speed things up by 7 ttJa3. Then 8 ttJbd2 (D) 7 ... i.e6 (7 ... gS!? 8 ttJc4 f6 is a playable set-up) 8 ttJc4 'fic7 9 a4 compares well with the game, although Black is not objectively worse, and apart from the conventionaI9 ... ttJf6 might even B pursue the idea of 9 ... hS !? For example, 10 h4 ttJh6 (l0 ... ttJf6? 11 ttJfxeS! ttJxeS 12 ttJxeS with the idea of trapping the queen and winning the piece back after 12 ...

This appears to yield at least equal chances.
7. .. g5!?
This unusual flank thrust is a possibility af- forded by the fact that Black hasn't played ... tZ:lf6. Whether this equalizes or not (and it seems to do so handily), he is playing upon White's extra tempo to create new chances for himself. In fact, this is the case in more ways than one: compare the analogous situation in the King's Indian Defence following 1 d4 ttJf6
2 c4 g6 3 ttJc3 i.g7 4 e4 d6 S i.e2 O-O 6 g4,
when Black's traditional recipe is 6 ... cS, to strengthen the effect of his bishop on the long diagonal after 7 dS (D).
B
For example, 7 ... e6 and ... exdS can follow, with Benoni-like themes. The move ... cS would make little sense if ... eS were already in; for one thing, Black's knights wouldn't have access to cS, as White's do (to c4, that is) in the main game. Thus White's extra move e4 in our main game, while obviously good in some respects, becomes a mixed blessing.
8. .. i.e6
Not bad, but a direct attack appears more promising, and provides justification for 7 ... gS: 8 ... hS 9 ttJc4 f6. Now 10 h4!? is an attempt to halt Black's advance. There can follow 1O ... g4!? 11 ttJel i.e6 12 f4! gxf3 13 i.xf3 iLf7 14 \\Ve2 \\Vc7 with a dynamic balance.

For more equalizers against the King's Indian Attack, see Morozevich-Krarnnik, the last game in this se- quence. S O-O lbf6 (D) In the previous game, Black played S. .. i.e7 here.

w 6lba3 This is the mirror image of ... lba6, which is Black's second most popular move in the main- line King's Indian Defence. After 6 e4 .Be7 the traditional main line would arise following 7 lbc3 d4 8 lbe2, with Black a move behind. As might be expected, he doesn't have to walk into the standard King's Indian pawn-storm, partic- ularly as he has not yet castled.

(D) We've arrived at a reversed King's Indian position; in the regular King's Indian line, White would already have castled by this point.

In spite of his excel- lent knight on c4, White has no way to open lines safely and can become saddled with a ter- rible light-squared bishop, whereas Black has kingside prospects; for example, IS g4?!

This primitive move is largely based upon discouraging White's standard attack with f4, followed by ttJf3 and/or f5 and g4. Some possi- bilities: a) 11 f4 h4 12 f5 .txc4 13 dxc4 hxg3 14 hxg3 O-O-O 15 ttJd3 ~dg8, with the idea ... g6, launches a kingside attack.

Nisipeanu - Volokitin European Ch, Silivri 2003 In this game we'll see another major varia- tion of the King's Indian Defence, the Classical Fianchetto, played with colours reversed.

(thumb- ing his nose at White's extra tempo, Black plays the move that makes his whole position most vulnerable!) 10 .l:tel l:te8 11 a4!?, and here Gufeld suggests l1...lLldb4('!'), a trick which comes from the white side of a standard King's Indian Defence line.

Now White is a full tempo ahead of the re- versed position from the g3 King's Indian De- fence.

Black wants to play this anyway in order to develop and centralize while fortifying his po- sition. Those familiar with King's Indian De- fence theory will recognize this exact position as yet another in which White is playing the role of Black with an extra move. But White has the usual issue that if he plays the equalizing moves available to Black in the King's Indian
218 MASTERING THE CHESS OPENINGS
Defence, he can't expect more than a level game. And the tactical possibilities appear in- sufficient to produce an advantage; for exam- ple: a) 12 'iVa3lLlde7! 13 'ii'xcS 'ii'xd3. b) 12 'iVbS lLlc7! can be followed by 13 'ii'xcS 'iixd3 or 13 'ii'xb7 i.dS!. c) After 12 lLlb3, which is the main move with reversed colours, Nisipeanu gives 12 ... lLlb6 13 'i¥bS (13 'ii'h4 'ii'xh4 14lLlxh4lLla4) 13 ... c4 14 lLlcs a6, which is good for Black after the forced IS lLlxe6 axbS 16 lLlxd8 l:tfxd8. Why does this work? In the King's Indian Defence position, White has played the extra move 'i¥c2, which is the equivalent of ... 'iVc7 in this line. So, after 14 lLlcs a6 IS lLlxe6, IS ... axbS?? would lose 16lLlxc7. The extra move hurts! We should remember that White's position is a King's Indian Defence that is designed to give Black ways to react to White's advances, not necessarily to force the pace. The recurring exchange of a pawn on d3 for a pawn on cS is an example of how Black can go for equality in a way that White wouldn't want to with colours reversed. 12 'ii'c4! i.e6! 13 'ii'xc5 :fd8 Black has a well-centralized position and pressure on d3, which seems enough for a pawn. 14 'ii'a3 (D)

It's important to realize, however, that the slower the system that Black plays, the more easily he equalizes, which is why the KIA can be so unrewarding for White. Let me describe some standard options, with- out detailed analysis: a) l. .. cS is an extremely popular move; for example, 2 g3 (2 e4 is a Sicilian Defence; 2 c4 is a Symmetrical English) 2 ... lLlc6 3 i.g2 g6 4 O-O (4 d4 cxd4 S lLlxd4 i.g7 forces the d4- knight to move and affords White little chance for advantage) 4 ... i.g7 S d3 (D). Now Black can safely play S. .. e6 or S. .. lLlf6
6 e4 d6, both set-ups with good track records.
A slightly more ambitious move is S. .. eS (or S. .. d6 6 e4 eS), since 6 e4 (6 c4lLlge7 7lLlc3 O-O is a standard line of the Symmetrical English, which is equal; see Volume 3) 6 ... lLlge7 is not only equal, but easy to play.

This is a rather harmless type of Closed Sicilian. For White to create problems for his opponent, he would ideally have his pawn on f4 in front of his knight, or his king's knight on e2. All of these lines are equal, of course, but the latter set-ups force Black to play accurately.

Let's start with a pairing oftwo openings that are out of to day's mainstream: the Vienna Game and the Ponziani Opening. We'll see how the most modest of ex- tra tempi impacts the resulting positions. Ljubojevic - Ciocaltea Skopje Olympiad 1972

s. .. iLcS!? Black intentionally loses a tempo to set up a pin that in tum forces White to lose time on the queenside. 5 ... iLb4 is a sensible alternative; for example: a) 6 .i.d3!? has the idea 6 ... ttJc5 7 iLe2 d4 8 a3 .i.a5 9 b4 dxc3 10 d4 ttJe4 11 bxa5, when White seems to have a modest edge. But Black might try 6 .. .f5!?, which looks fully playable after 7 exf6 (7 iLe2 O-O 8 O-O iLe6) 7 ... ttJxf6 8 0-00-0 (a small joke is 8 ... ttJc6 9 iLb5?! O-O 10 d4 and Black has gained a move!) 9 .i.e2 ttJc6
10 a3 iLa5 11 d4 iLg4.
b) 6 ~e2! may be as good as anything; for example, 6 ... iLxc3 7 dxc3 O-O 8 iLf4 iLe6 9 O-O-O ttJd7 10 ~e1 c6 with active chances for both sides. Compare the reversed position with 6 iLb5 in the Ponziani Opening game below.

In this position, strongly reminiscent of a French Winawer, Black's knights are aggres- sively placed and White's bishops have yet to find active roles.

4d4 It's logical to strike back in the centre in this way, as Black does in the Vienna Game. The W only other reasonable way to counter Black's threat of ... fxe4 is 4 exf5, when the obvious course is 4 ... e4, but 5 lbd4 with the idea d3, played in many games, seems to keep a small edge. Maybe Black could play 4 .. :~f6, trying to win the f-file in old-fashioned King's Gambit style. The play could go 5 d4! e4 6lbg5 d5 (D). w Here White needs to disturb the equilibrium: a) 7 ~h5+!? g6 8 fxg6 hxg6 9 "iVe2 .Bd6, and in terms of space, open lines, and develop- ment, Black has quite a lot for a pawn. b) White can also try to undermine Black's centre by means of7 c4; for example, 7 ... .Bb4+ 8lbc3 (watch out for 8 .Bd2?? ~xgS) 8 ... lbge7! (development comes first; the pawns are not as important) 9 g4 (9 cxdSlbxd5 10 lbgxe4 ~xd4) 9 ... ~xd4 with an obscure position, which is about equal. 4 ... fxe4 5 lbxe5 lbf6 (D) After S. .. ~f6, the blockading manoeuvre 6 lbg4 ~g6 7 .Bf4 (or 7 .Be2) 7 ... d6 8 lbe3 has had some success, but the resulting positions are playable for Black. Instead, S. .. lbxe5!? 6 dxeS threatens ~dS, when 6 ... dS 7 exd6 .Bxd6 8 ~a4+ wins the e-pawn. That may not be the end of it, however, because Black can tum the opening into a gambit following 8 ... c6 9 ~xe4+ lbe7 10 .Bc4 (versus ... O-O) 1O ... ~c7 with the idea ... .ifS. Of course, White has a pawn and no weaknesses, so this is speCUlative.
6.Bc4!?
As we've seen, this idea originates from the Vienna Game. White reasons that he'll be a tempo up on what is after all a pretty good line for Black. Naturally, White has other ways to handle the position, of which 6 .Bg5 may be the most important. White stands well after 6 ... .Bd6?! 7 lbg4! .Be7 8 .Bxf6 .Bxf6 9 dS!, 6 ... .Be7 7 .Bb5! or 6 ... d6 7lbxc6 bxc6 8lbd2 d5 9 ~a4 .Bd7 10 f3. Following 6 ... ~e7 7 .Bxf6 (7 lbg4 dS!?) 7 .. :iiVxf6 8lbg4 ~g6 White can try 9lbe3 or 9 dS. These ideas are barely explored, as is typical with some of the oldest openings. The entertaining and instructive attacking game Nakamura-Becerra, USA Ch, Stillwater 2007 continued 6 .ibS .Bd6 (6 ... ~e7 may be best, as in the reversed position) 7 lbc4 (7 f4! exf3 8lbxf3 is a fighting alternative; compare 6 .Bd3 fS in the reversed line) 7 ... .Be7 8 .Ba4 (8 dS a6 9 .Ba4 bS doesn't improve much upon the reversed position, because White's extra move c3 isn't generally useful; he can win a pawn at the cost of development by 10 dxc6 bxa4 11 'YWxa4 dS 12 lbe3 O-O, but Black has a strong centre and excellent attacking chances) 8 ... dS 9 lbeS O-O! (this is a typical sacrifice in double e- pawn openings, famously in the Two Knights Defence; it yields Black development and ac- tivity for a pawn) 10 .Bxc6 (10 lbxc6? bxc6 II .Bxc6lIb8 has ideas such as ... .Ba6, ... lIb6 and ...

This actually produces a worse position than White would have without his extra move c3. White can also play 8 liJxd7 'iVxd7, which is equal, or try 8 c4!. Then he has lost a full tempo (c3-c4) and transposed exactly to Black's posi- tion from the corresponding Vienna Game po- sition from the last game (the note to 7 ... i.g4). As it happens, he gets better winning chances with that move than with any other! 8 ••• liJxeS 9 dxeS i.xbS 10 exf6 ~d7 Now White would like to be able to play 11 liJc3, but can't! In fact, the bonus move c3 has hurt him and Black has a clear advantage. To close out the subject of reversed posi- tions, I'll put a number of other examples from the double e-pawn realm into the following game. J. Polgar - Ivanchuk Amber Blindfold, Monte Carlo 1994
1 e4 eS 2 liJc3
Or: a) 2 liJf3 is a forcing move, but Black can still play variations with reversed themes, again involving the f-pawn: al) 2 .. .fS (D) is the Latvian Gambit. In comparison with the black side of the King's Gambit (1 e4 eS 2 f4), White has the ex- tra liJf3, a vital move that plays a role in most 1 e4 eS openings. But the knight development also has drawbacks. Now, upon 3 exfS, Black has a move which would be pointless for White in the King's Gambit, that is, 3 ... e4, when 4 liJe5 and 4 liJgI are playable, but certainly not cause for abandonment of the Latvian. Similarly, if White tries to 'decline' the gambit by 3 i.c4, Black has the opportunity to play 3 .. .fxe4, meet- ing 4 liJxe5 with 4 ... 'iVg5 or 4 ... d5, both standard variations that have been heavily analysed for over SO years and apparently still regarded as playable for Black, although that can be dis- puted. In the King's Gambit, the same idea 1 e4 e5 2 f4 i.cs 3 fxe5?? loses to 3 ... "iVh4+. Another
i-PAWNS AND REVERSED OPENINGS 225
example is 2 liJf3 f5 3 liJc3 fxe4, when 4 ~5+ is illegal- the extra move gets in the way, as op- posed to 1 e4 e5 2 f4liJc6 3 fxe5?? ~4+. W Finally, 3 d4, trying to reverse the Falkbeer Counter-Gambit upon 3 ... exd4?! 4 e5!, runs into 3 .. .fxe4! 4 liJxe5 liJf6; note again that if White didn't have liJf3 in, 3 ... fxe4 would be a blunder due to 4 'i!Vh5+. All of the 3rd moves above are playable for White, in spite of the differences I've noted, but they aren't convincing ways for him to secure the better game. As a consequence, you will see the move 3 liJxe5 in most Latvian Gambit con- tests, which isn't a reversed variation, and yet offers the best chances for a substantial advan- tage. a2) 2 ... liJc6 (D) has its own twists: w a21) 3 liJc3 liJf6 is the Four Knights Game, which we shall look at in Chapter 7 as an exam- ple of symmetry in the opening. Now 4 ~c4 liJxe4 5 liJxe4 d5 6 ~d3 dxe4 7 ~xe4 is yet another reversed position, probably favouring White slightly. Its twin is 3 ... ~c5 4liJxe5liJxe5 5 d4~d6 6dxe5 ~xe5 7 ~d3, andif7 ... 'i!Vh4, 8 liJd5. In this version, White's tempo helps, and his superiority is clear. a22) 3 ~b5 f5 (D). This is the Schliemann Defence, which has a decent reputation. In terms of a reversed open- ing, it's a Vienna Game (1 e4 e5 2 liJc3 liJf6 3 f4), in which White has the extra move .tb5. Strange to say, this would hurt White if he tried the standard remedy to the Vienna position, which is 4 d4 fxe4 5 liJxe5?! (5 ~xc6 dxc6 6 liJxe5 liJf6 is about equal), as 5 ... liJxe5 6 dxe5 c6 (in the reversed position, White's bishop is still on fl, so this tempo-gain isn't possible) 7 ~c4 (having come this far, White normally tries the unclear piece sacrifice 7 liJc3 cxb5 8 liJxe4) 7 .. :~a5+ followed by 8 .. :iVxe5 wins a pawn. White should play otherwise; for exam- ple, by 4 d3 or the traditional main line, 4liJc3. b) 2 d3 is a bit odd for White, but the idea is to delay the move f4 until Black commits. Then 2 ... liJf6 (the equivalent of 1 e4liJf6 2 d3 e5) 3 f4 is a sort of reversed Philidor Counter-Gambit, an opening which goes 1 e4 e5 2 liJf3 d6 3 d4 f5. After 3 f4, there can follow 3 ... exf4 4liJf3 (4 e5 Wlie7 5 "iVe2 liJd5! is good, with the idea 6 c4?! Wlib4+!) 4 ... d5 5 e5liJh5!, and Black has a typical King's Gambit Accepted position, but with the move ... d5 in exchange for d3, clearly a trade-off in Black's favour. Compare the actual Philidor Counter-Gambit with 2liJf3 d6 3 d4 f5 4 exf5 e4, when 5 liJh4?? loses a piece. On the other hand, White can play 5 liJg5, which is theoretically favourable for him, so this com- parison merely reveals a drawback to the line with 2 d3 and 3 f4, rather than providing salva- tion for the Philidor Counter-Gambit. 2 ... liJf6 (D) 3~c4 Or: a) One of several replies to 3 g3 is 3 ... i..b4, a reversed Ruy Lopez (1 e4 e5 2liJf3liJc6 3 ~b5 g6) in which g3 and ~g2 is enough to equalize, but too slow for White to expect an advantage. After 4 ~g2, Mariotti-Korchnoi, Rome 1982 continued 4 ... O-O (4 ... c6 5liJf3 d6 is also equal) 5 liJge2 c6 6 O-O d5!? (or 6 ... d6 7 d4 ~e6) 7 exd5 cxd5 8 d4 exd4 9liJxd4 ~xc3?!

The Classical can be a pretty active system, so let's see if White can make good use of the extra tempo. 4liJf3 This is the purest reversed system, imitating the normal Classical Ruy Lopez with 3 ... liJf6 4 O-O 1i.c5. Two alternatives: a) 4 d3 isn't bad, of course, but it does make 4 ... d5 possible, which is at any rate close to equal, if not fully so, after 5 exd5 liJxd5 6 i.d2 (6 liJe2liJc6 7 O-O liJb6 8 i.b3 O-O 9liJe4!? has the odd-looking intention of playing f4; this is probably about equal following 9 ... a5! 10 a3 i.e7 11 h3 ~h8!? 12 f4 a4 13 i.a2 f5 14liJ4c3)

7 Symmetry and its Descendants
Students often complain about how this or that opening is 'drawish'. However, it's hard to find convincing examples. Even well past the open- ing stage, simplified and equal chess positions can be won by the better player on that day. This is all the more true when the players are below master strength, because their more fre- quent mistakes will present opportunities for the opponent. The charge of drawishness is regularly lev- elled at symmetrical openings, or ones that in- volve a symmetrical pawn-structure. There's a huge difference, however, between a 'drawish' opening and one which seems boring to you or not dynamic enough. In fact, I think that a dis- taste for dry openings can be a healthy thing for developing players; after all, most masters have energetic styles and strive for the initia- tive. And even those who ultimately adopt highly positional styles usually start out with some ambitious openings (Karpov and Kram- nik come to mind). However, it's important to realize that just because an opening seems te- dious, it doesn't follow that a drawn result be- comes likely. Also, fortunately, you'll find that positions which previously bored you become increasingly interesting as you study them more deeply. Understanding the issues related to symmetry in the opening can expand your overall under- standing of chess. The game would be impover- ished if one side could simply imitate the other, or even if White were the only one who could productively avoid symmetry. As it happens, there are few if any variations in chess in which neither player can productively break symme- try. As is the case with reversed openings, in- formation can be the key factor. That is, the knowledge of what White has done makes it easier for Black to find an independent set-up. For his part, White can break symmetry simply by setting up positions in which imitation leads to inferior positions. You will see how easy that is. We've already seen' numerous examples of symmetrical openings in this series, notably in Volume 3 with the many variations of the Sym- metrical English (l c4 c5). After I d4 d5, the best-known truly symmetrical opening is the Exchange Variation of the Slav Defence, I d4 d5 2 c4 c6 3 cxd5 cxd5. We examined this in Volume 2, Chapter 3. While it's true that some players use this variation to gain early draws, we saw that either player can deviate from symmetry with full confidence of maintaining equality while unbalancing the play. The sym- metrical variation I d4 d5 2 c4 c5 is a different matter. Whether White plays 3 cxd5 or 3 dxc5, he can quickly reach asymmetrical and favour- able positions, which accounts for the obscurity of2 ... c5. In this chapter, I'll concentrate upon a few fairly important openings that aren't dealt with elsewhere in this series, in which symmetry begins on move one. In doing so, I'll also be able to consider a number of pawn-structures I haven't previously addressed. Petroff Defence

This is called the Petroff Defence, also known as the Russian Defence. w
230 MASTERING THE CHESS OPENINGS
Like many symmetrical variations, it has a reputation for dry or even drawish play. This stems from the perceived drawish nature of games between elite players and years of com- mentary from books and magazines. To be sure, of the 900+ Petroff Defence games in my data- base between opponents who are both rated above 2600, we find that 63% of the games are drawn, as opposed to 50% for both the Sicilian and French Defences. Nevertheless, White has an overall success rate of 58% (well above av- erage), and a solid lead over Black in perfor- mance rating. Clearly Black doesn't get his normal share of wins, a fact which can easily be missed as we see elite players like Kramnik us- ing the Petroff in order to secure effortless draws (and even occasional victories) as Black. But just because a world champion manages to pull off a draw doesn't mean that you, as White, won't find ample winning chances. Let's explore some theory of the Petroff De- fence, keeping an eye on the way that symmet- rical structures influence the play. At the same time, I'll give an overview of how this classic opening breaks down. Keep in mind that many variations are necessarily omitted, and this cov- erage doesn't reflect the proportion in which they are played in practice. Shirov - Yusupov Ter Apel1997

3 .•. 4:lxe4 These days, 3 ... exd4 is less popular. One main line goes 4 e5 4:le4 5 ~xd4 d5 6 exd6 4:lxd6 7 4:lc3 4:lc6 8 ~f4 with the idea of .1i.e3 and O-O-O, posing Black some problems.
4.1i.d3
If White plays 4 dxe5, Black usually replies 4 ... d5, when after 5 4:lbd2, 5 ... 4:lxd2 and 5 ... 4:lc5 are the main lines. White has been finding his way to modest advantages versus those moves. But 4 ... .1i.c5 may be considerably stronger than previously thought, especially with variations like 5 .1i.c4 4:lxf2 6 .1i.xf7+ ~xf7 (6 ... ~f8 7 ~d5 4:lxhl 8 .1i.h5! is unclear) 7 ~d5+ (follow- ing very old theory) 7 ... ~g6!' This was played in Short-Smeets, Wijk aan Zee 2010: 8 i.g5 ~e8 9 4:lh4+? (9 O-O) 9 ... ~xg5 10 4:ld2 ~h6? (1O ... d6! should win, as the black king survives its walk) 11 4:lf5+ ~g6 12 4:lh4+ ~h6 13 4:lf5+ ~g6 14 4:lh4+ with a draw. Of course, White has many alternatives early on, but nothing that looks particularly attractive. 4 .•• dS S 4:lxeS (D)

Black recovers his piece and is sacrificing a pawn for compensation. It's hard to believe that White can't retain some advan- tage, but it's fun to see how even this discarded line is taken seriously in the age of computers. Briefly, the main line is 6 d4 (the only impor- tant alternative is 6 f4, when after 6 ... dxe5, 7 "iVxe5?! ~xe5+ 8 fxe5 ltJc6 9 ..tb5 ..td7 10 ..txc6 ..txc6 gives Black obvious compensation;

instead, 7 fxe5 f5! is a line analysed in depth by O.Cohen - whether or not it equalizes com- pletely, as he suggests, Black has lots of play) 6 ... dxe5 7 dxe5!

O-O-O to fol- low) 7 ... ttJc6 (D). w We have seen the idea of exploiting such an e5-pawn on an open file in many openings be- fore. The success of this strategy depends upon developing quickly and maintaining the initia- tive; for example: a) 8 iLb5 iLd7 9 ttJc3 'ilVb4! was played and analysed by Friedrich Volkmann and others and seems sufficient for equality. b) 8 f4!? may be underrated. Then 8 ... iLg4 with the idea ... O-O-O has been recommended, along with 8 ... 'iVb4+ 9 ~xb4 ttJxb4, but I sus- pect that White retains the better game in both cases. c) 8 .tf4 g5! 9 iLd2 (not 9 iLg3?? in view of 9 .. .f5!. and ... f4 will win the bishop) 9 .. .f5 10 ~e2 ng8 with the idea .. .i Le6 and ... O-O-O, Baron-O.Cohen, Givataim 2007. d) Of course, White has less ambitious pos- sibilities; for example, Cohen analyses 8 ttJc3 'iVxe5 9 ~xe5+ ttJxe5 10 iLf4 f6 with a slight edge for White, which is perhaps not the goal of either player! 4 ttJf3 I'll mention some lesser-played lines as I go along. A rather silly sacrifice that has had peri- odic success is 4 ttJxf7?! ~xf7, the Cochrane Gambit, and now White can play 5 ttJc3, 5 iLc4+ or 5 d4. Having written about these moves in detail, I can only say that this sacrifice is wildly overrated, and that Black gets a definite advantage with correct play. On the other hand, Black seldom plays correctly, and in fact the few times elite players have faced 4 ttJxf7, they have reacted with playable but inferior moves! 4 •.. ttJxe4 (D) w 5d4 The Petroff Defence is not as limited as you might think from watching top-level technical games over the years, most of which repeat the same lines over and over. Here is a brief outline of some early alternatives for White, of which 'c' and 'd' are the most attractive: a) 5 d3 ttJf6 6 d4 d5 (an Exchange French) is not the most inspiring of symmetrical positions, but the players can always get creative later. b) Another attempt to break symmetry has been used extensively over the years: 5 ~e2 ~e7
6 d3 ttJf6 7 iLg5, threatening to double Black's
pawns on f6. This has tended to allow Black easy equality; for example, 7 ... ttJbd7 (or 7 ... 'ilVxe2+ 8 iLxe2 i.e7 9 ttJc3 h6 10 iLh4 ttJbd7) 8 ttJc3 'iVxe2+ 9 iLxe2 h6 10 iLM g5 11 iLg3 ttJh5 12 ttJd5 ~d8 with a good game, Reinderman- Kasimdzhanov, Wijk aan Zee 1999. c) A very interesting asymmetrical line at this point begins with 5 c4!? Then if Black plays slowly by 5 ... iLe7, White can try to trans- pose into a pleasant main line by 6 d4, and upon other moves such as 5 ... c6, 5 ... ttJc6 and 5 ... d5, he plays 6 ttJc3, answering 6 ... ttJxc3 with 7 dxc3, a pawn-structure which lends itself to ac- tive development. For those looking for variety, it's worth experimenting with this. d) 5 ttJc3 ttJxc3 6 dxc3 has been played a great deal at the very top levels. If Black is
234 MASTERING THE CHESS OPENINGS
well-prepared, he should equalize; often, how- ever, the resulting position will be sufficiently unbalanced for either side to play for a win. I'll leave this one for you to research as well. S•.• dS (D) Some strong players have done all right with S. .. J..e7 6 J..d3 lbf6, but after White sets up with h3, O-O, c4 and lbc3, he has more territory under control and an undoubted, if small, ad- vantage. w A funny picture. It's as though Black had the first move of the game, and after four symmetri- cal moves (e.g., in an Exchange French), played S ... lbe4. Normally, in other openings, such an advanced and supported knight is a force to be reckoned with. But here it is actually a minor disadvantage, in that White can undermine the knight's support by c4 and .i.d3, subsequently forcing its retreat or exchanging it under more favourable terms than are presently available. He usually does this via moves such as.:tel, ~c2 and lbc3. Crucially, the knight on e4 doesn't defend dS, which can be attacked. By contrast, White's knight on f3 protects the d4-pawn. Note also that there is only one file open in this position, so you might think that rooks would inevitably be ex- changed on it. However, as in the Exchange Variation of the French Defence, that seldom happens unless the players are mutually intent upon drawing. For one thing, all the key squares down the e-file are protected by pawns or minor pieces, so the rooks may find better prospects somewhere else on the board. 6 i.d3 i.d6 Maintaining the near-symmetry.

Or: a) Rubinstein's move 4 ... liJd4, with the idea 5 liJxe5 'iVe7, has traditionally been a sound theoretical answer to the Four Knights with 4 J1i.b5. White has many ways to proceed, such as the traditional main line 5 J1i.a4 and less common ideas such as 5 O-O, 5 J1i.e2 or 5 J1i.c4. There is currently a good deal of research going into the Four Knights, and this last move, 5 ~c4, in particular is unresolved. For example, after 5 ... liJxf3+, 6 gxf3! is enjoying consistent suc- cess, even on a grandmaster level (d4 and/or f4 follow), and some analysts believe that 5 ... .iLc5 6liJxe5, while risky-looking, results in a small advantage for White.

Marin points out that Black has "no active prospects at all if White so wishes", and that he "has to play carefully ... to avoid falling behind in development". This is true, but the majority of games are drawn, so as a practical matter this can't be to White's liking either. Alekhine- Capablanca, StPetersburg 1914 was an early il- lustration: 8 .. :~'e5+ 9 ~e2 (9 .i.e2!? with the idea 9 ... .i.c5 10 O-O O-O 11 .i.d3 d5!? 12 'iff3 gives White a few chances) 9 ...

The point is not that 4 ... .i.b4 is a superior move, but that it seems to be a better way for Black to guarantee himself an unbalanced game. b) 4 ... .i.d6!? illustrates the creativity in mod- em opening play. Black has had reasonable success with this move, which prepares the re- organization by ... O-O, ... l:i.e8, ... .1f8 and per- haps ... d5, while protecting the e-pawn so as to give the opportunity for ... a6 if desired.

Once again, White has to decide when and how he wants to break symmetry. 6d3 Or: a) The natural 6 tLJd5 tLJxd5 7 exd5 tLJd4 8 tLJxd4 exd4 returns to a symmetrical position in which White hasn't yet demonstrated an effec- tive way to disturb the equilibrium. In this re- gard, however, he might try 9 c3 i.c5 10 'ii'f3, or the more ambitious, if committal, 9 ~g4 .1c5 10 .i.d3!? d6 11 ~f4 with the idea b3 and .i.b2, or sometimes c3. b) After 6 .1xc6 dxc6, White gets nowhere with 7 tLJxe5 l:te8, and so plays 7 d3. This is another type of Exchange Ruy Lopez position. Black has tried many moves here, such as 7 ... ~e7, 7 ... .1d6, 7 ... l:te8 and 7 ... tLJd7. They are all playable, but direct and active solutions are generally easier to handle, so I like Marin's recommendation of7 ... .1g4 8 h3 (after 8 ~e2, Black can play 8 ... tLJd7 with the idea 9 tLJdl 'iVf6!) 8 ... .1h5. Then Soffer-Alterman, Tel-Aviv 1998 continued 9 'iVe2 (9 g4? tLJxg4! 10 hxg4 .1xg4 11 'iitg2 f5 is too strong; this is a sacrifice which comes up in several e-pawn openings) 9 ... tLJd7 10 g4!? .1g6 11 tLJdl .1d6 12 tLJe3 tLJc5!

In place of this, Alterman suggests the tactical device 13 tLJxe5!? i.xe5

The first two moves let White reorganize with 17 lZJc4 and in some cases i.e3, but 16 ... h6!? forces 17 fxg6 fxg6, which establishes control of some dark squares and keeps White's knight from f5. That should be fine, and 16 ... h5 17 fxg6 fxg6 might be even more accurate, since 18 gxh5? allows 18 .. .l:txfl 19 lZJxfl ~f8 20 i.e3 i.xe3 21 lZJxe3 lZJe6!. 6 ... d6 Maintaining the symmetry. 6 ... i.xc3 7 bxc3 d6 is also possible, if only to avoid White's al- ternative in the next note. 7 i.g5 (D) With this move White threatens 8 lZJd5. 7 lZJe2 is another standard idea; then Black's bishop is a bit stranded on b4 and the move lZJg3 is useful for kingside action. In top-level encounters stretching back to Tarrasch, Rubin- stein and Euwe, Black has chosen to imitate White by 7 ... lZJe7 (Smyslov once played 7 ... i.d7

Historically, 4 i.b5 i.M has a drawish reputa- tion, but in fact White has a 57% score from this point, and a considerable lead in performance rating. Even the drawing percentage, at 37%, is not out of the ordinary, and includes a large number of quick draws in which the variation went essentially untested. In other words, this position is full of life. 11 i.el! White has ideas of using this bishop on a3, but his retreat is also a reaction to the lack of promising alternatives.

B
After this bishop retreat, we can see the ba- sic features of the position developing. White has a bishop-pair and prospects of gaining space, which is generally a good combination. But the difficulties with his structure are worth noting. White has three options regarding what to do with the d-pawn: 1) He can exchange it on e5, but that isolates his c-pawns and frees the c5-square for one of Black's pieces. 2) He can advance the pawn to d5, but this seriously reduces the mobility of his pawns, be- cause c4-c5 is easily prevented (by ... b6, if nothing else). Worse, if Black can play ... c6 and ... cxd5 (or recapture with a piece if White plays dxc6), then White's pawns on c2 and c3 will be especially exposed down the half-open c-file, and Black will have permanent outposts for his pieces on c4 and c5. Therefore White will nor- mally make the advance d5 only when he has a strong attack elsewhere (for example, on the kingside with f4), or when Black has already committed to ... c5 and cannot open the c-file. These themes are almost the same ones that we saw in the Nimzo-Indian Defence in Volume 2, and especially in the Samisch Variation. 3) White can and usually does leave the d- pawn where it is, exerting some pressure on e5. Then he can organize f4, to attack that square further, and/or play for lLlh4-f5 . Black would like to neutralize White's bish- ops by locking the position, but there's no way to rule out some pawn-break by White, regard- less of whether d5 has been played. So he will generally try to reserve activity somewhere else on the board. Depending upon circumstances, that may well involve a queenside advance such as ... b5 (particularly in the ... c5 main lines); sometimes he can aim for ... d5, either with or without ... c6. Black will also try to prevent or anticipate any attempt to play f4, and in doing so he can even play on the kingside himself if the opportunity arises. 1l. .. c5 The most direct move, trying to resolve the central situation. Black has a row of legitimate alternatives; for example: a) ll...c6 12 ..tfl (intending a double cap- ture on e5) 12 .. .'iVc7 (or 12 .. J:td8) 13lLlh4l:[e8

~a5, Sturua-A.Mikhalevski, Biel 1999, and now Mikhalevski suggests 16 lLlf5 exf4 17 ctJxd6, but then the tactic 17 ... 'iVxc3! 18 ctJxe8 ctJxe8 19 ..txf4 ctJxd4! wins back material, in view of 20 ..td3 'iVxe1 +! 21 'iVxe1 ctJf3+. In all of these positions, White has to prepare f4 care- fully or risk overextending his position. b) 1l...l:[d8 12..tfl (12 ctJh4 c5 13 ctJf5 'iVc7) 12 ... b6!? introduces a strategy of luring the d- pawn forward so as to eliminate the central ten- sion and target White's queenside.

'ilVf614 i.e3l':!.e8 15 i.g2 h616 ~d2 b6, at which point the players agreed to a draw. White might try 17 4:Jh4, intending f4, when 17 ... i.b7 18 4:Jf5 4:Jg5! hits e4 and plans 19 f3 d5! 20 h4!? dxe4 with great complications. c2) 13 ... c5 14 i.g2 l':!.b8 15 h4 b5 16 h5 a5 17 4:Jh4 (Aagaard suggests 17 d5 4:Jc7 18 4:Jh4) 17 ... g6. Here, instead of 18 i.e3 b4 19 d5, as in Conquest-Ledger, British Ch, Liverpool 2008, when Black should have played 19 ... 4:Jf4!, White can close the centre and try to activate his bishops by 18 i.h6l':!.d8 19 d5 4:Jc7 (19 ... 4:Jf4?? 20 gxf4 "iVxh4?? 21 i.g5) 20 a4 b4 21 'ilVd2 with the idea f4. These are not dull positions. You can see that the symmetrical nature of the Four Knights doesn't limit its strategic complexity. We now return to 11...c5 (D): w 12 i.ft Another bishop retreat to its home square! There are several points to this move, but the main one is that White would like to play g3 in order to support the move 4:Jh4 and, in the best of worlds, f4. But if he is to do this, his bishop is needed to defend the kingside light squares. Instead, 12 dxe5 dxe5 13 4:Jxe5?? loses to 13 ... ttJc7, and 12 d5 releases the tension before it's necessary; in response, Black can smoothly develop his queenside play via 12 ... 4:Jc7 13 i.n i.d7 14 a4l':!.ab8, with ... b5 to follow shortly. White's main alternative is the flexible move 12 a4, to restrain ... b5 and see how events de- velop. Then: a) In Spassky-Xie Jun, Copenhagen 1997, Black committed a common error by opening up the central position: 12 ... 4:Jc7 13 i.n i.g4 14 h3! i.xf3?! 15 'ilVxf3 cxd4 16 cxd4 exd4 17 e5! 4:Jd7 18 i.a3 4:Jxe5 19 'i!Vxb7, threatening 20 l':!.xe5!. b) 12 ... l':!.d8 (D) is much better: bl) In Short-Anand, Linares 1992, White clarified the centre and tried to advance on the kingside by 13 dxe5 dxe5 14 'ilVe2 ~c7 15 i.c4 h6 16 4:Jh4 l':!.e8 17 4:Jf5 4:Jf4 18 'iWf3, where- upon Anand suggests that 18 ... i.e6 19 i.n c4 would at least equalize. b2) After 13 d5, Black can employ a stan- dard set-up by 13 ... 4:Jf8 14 i.n 4:Jg6 15 g3 h6.

Symmetry in the English Opening The English Opening with 1 c4 cS is a major source of symmetrical play (as well as a gold- mine of reversed lines). As you can see by ex- amining Volume 3, most variations become unbalanced by move S at the latest, but a few are likely to exhibit extended symmetry. Two generalizations seem to apply to these lines. First, Black can depart from symmetry in vari- ous ways with little risk. However, the longer Black imitates White's moves, the greater are White's chances to reach a favourable and dou- ble-edged position. Let me briefly cite some variations from Volume 3 to illustrate this. One of the best-known symmetrical varia- tions is 1 c4 cS 2 lOc3 lOc6 3 g3 g6 4 .Bg2 .Bg7, when after S 1Of3, the old main line is S. .. lOf6 6 O-O (or 6 d4) 6 ... O-O 7 d4 cxd4 8 lOxd4. Then White has a small advantage and has enjoyed excellent results. However, Black doesn't have to imitate White to this extent; he can break the symmetry earlier with S ... eS, S. .. e6 or S. .. d6, all respectable moves which grant him fully-fledged play. Similarly, after S a3, Black can imitate his op- ponent for a long time, notably in this variation:

a6 6 l:!.bl nb8 7 b4 cxb4 8 axb4 b5 9 cxb5 axb510 lOf3 (D) IO .•. e5

Black decides to be the one to break symme- try. Continued imitation is risky, but not fatal; for example, 1O ... lOf6 11 d4 dS 12 .Bf4 (12 lOeSlOxeS 13 dxeSlOg4) 12 ... .ifS (12 ... nb6 is also possible) 13 .Bxb8 .ixbl 14 .i.f4 .ifS (14 ... .Be4 probably improves) IS O-O O-O 16 lOeS!, and now the symmetry is finally broken, in view of 16 ... lOe4?? l71Oxc61Oxc3 18 'iiel. Black should play 16 ... 'iib6 17 .ixdS! lOxeS! (17 ... lOxd4 18 .txf7+ l:txf7 19 .i.e3 and White will emerge a pawn up) 18 dxeS (18 .i.xeS nc8!) 18 ... lOg4, although he hasn't yet equal- ized following 19 .Bg21OxeS 20 lOdS. This is a typical result of too slavish an imitation, but it was fun while it lasted! 11 d4! White chooses the best point at which to seek an imbalance, rather than play 11 e4 and revert to the status quo. 11 ... exd4 12 lOd5 This unresolved and unclear position is ana- lysed in Volume 3, Chapter 7, in the notes to M.Domingo-Alekseev, Berlin 2006. The point is that you can find plenty of promising mate- rial in a symmetrical variation if your goal is to play for a win. Here's another variation that is traditionally considered drawish, probably more so than any other imitative line in the English. It won't sur- prise you that its evaluation is also unclear.

e6 Black can easily break symmetry with sound and interesting variations such as S. .. eS and S. .. lOf6, and the ambitious S. .. .Bxc3!? com- pletely unbalances the situation.

Rather than retain his passive knight on e7, Black does better to play 1O ... liJxd5!, when 11 liJxd5 exd5 returns to complete symmetry and almost no prospects. Instead, 11 'ilYb3 poses certain difficulties, but if you have studied the variation, they are quite manageable. On the other hand, 11 :tel creates winning chances that seem real enough, and avoids excessive simplification. This rook move was played in Ivanchuk-Krarnnik, Amber Rapid, Monte Carlo 1995, which is analysed in Volume 3 in the notes to the game Andersson-Gheorghiu, Mos- cow 1981. 11 'ilYb3! liJxd4 12 exd4 (D) White has reached a clearly superior posi- tion; see the game Benko-Geller, Wijk aan Zee 1969 in Chapter 7 of Volume 3. English Double Fianchetto Variation In Volume 3, I bypassed coverage of the Double Fianchetto Variation of the Symmetrical Eng- lish, a set-up with ... b6 and ... g6 which goes well with the fianchetto openings in this vol- ume. The issues will be familiar by now: can Black break symmetry without disadvantage, or can White force a favourable deviation from symmetry? The games and notes that follow by no means represent high theory, but will hope- fully serve as a guide to some of the major themes and issues of this opening.

6 b3 .Bg7 7 .Bb2 O-O (D)
w White has chosen to enter into the truly sym- metrical version of the Double Fianchetto. Black is supposed to equalize rather easily here, and indeed, the variation has a high percentage of draws. The key for Black is that he's under no pressure, and can therefore break the symmetry without much risk. Often this takes the form of a central liquidation. SliJc3 In a position this flexible, there are always too many lines to mention, so I'll limit myself to some common ones: a) 8 d4 cxd4 9 ~xd4 d6 10 l:.dl liJbd7 sets up a standard Hedgehog structure. 11 liJe1 (11 liJc3 liJe4 12 'ilYe3 .Bxc3 13 .Bxc3 liJxc3 14 'iVxc3 lic8 presents Black few problems; for ex- ample, 15 'iVd4liJf6 16:tac1, and 16 ...

The most important role of ... ctJa6, however, is to support Black's central pawn-break, as follows: 9d4dS This is the standard solution. 9 ... e6 and 9 ... ctJe4 are among the sound alternatives.

But that doesn't preclude a normally contested game if the players choose to pursue one. Having said that, it's still a relief to tum to the following modem treatment: Pantsulaia - Gelfand FIDE World Cup, Khanty-Mansiisk 2005

For example, SctJxe4 i.xe4 9 d3 (9 d4 cxd4 10 i.h6!? is clever-looking, but not particularly effective after 1O ... i.xh611 ~xd4 O-O 121lVxe4 ctJc613 :adl.l:i.cS 14 h4 i.g7, Stohl-Tukmakov, Bled 1997) 9 ... i.b7 10 e4 O-O (1O ... ctJc6! 11 .l:i.bl O-O is dead equal) 11 e5!?

The slightly odd-looking 9 .Be3 is the most popular move at this juncture. It very often transposes to the note to Black's 10th move after 9 ... ltJbd7 10 nfdl, so I'll defer a discus- sion about it until then. 9• •• ltJbd7 (D) Black often delays castling in these lines to keep more options open. Here 9 ... O-O should be answered by 10 'iVh4, as in the game. If the queen remains on d4 it is subject to discovered attack by ... ltJe4 or ... ltJd5. w You may recognize this as the Hedgehog Variation from Volume 3, but with ... g6 and ... iLg7 replacing ... e6 and ... .Be7. It's an inter- esting trade-off. At first blush, this seems to fa- vour Black, who can boast that his bishop is more active on the long diagonal, and that he has no weaknesses, in contrast to the weakness of the pawn on d6 which can be so important af- ter ... e6 and ... iLe7. Needless to say, that's not the end of the story. For one thing, in the Hedgehog, a pawn on e6 covers d5, so Black needn't worry about ltJd5 in most lines. In addi- tion, Black's kingside structure (with pawns on f7, g7 and h7) is ideal for protection against a direct attack, whereas Black's structure with ... g6 in the Double Fianchetto leads to the pos- sibility of attack via 'iVh4 and .Bh6. In the end, the two systems are roughly equivalent in worth, with the Double Fianchetto having a slightly safer feel, and the Hedgehog giving more coun- terattacking prospects. 10 'ii'h4 The most common move-order is 10 .Be3 (which is the equivalent of 9 .Be3 ltJbd7 10 l:!.fdl). As mentioned, the bishop covers c5 against a rook -lift, and it also aims at b6; the lat- ter tends to be a sensitive point because the move ... a6 is almost always included in Black's

.... l:!.e8 This is sometimes played after ... O-O, and will often transpose. Black wants to have ... :tcS available at the right moment, helping to defend against a potential kingside attack by White; to that end, ... .l:!.cS-hS is a theme. He also prepares ... .l:!.c7, in order to shift his queen to a8 and then double rooks on the c-file. The latter manoeuvre, in conjunction with ... a6 and ... bS, can create great pressure on White's queenside. In fact, Black's discovery of this rook manoeuvre was key to making the Double Fianchetto popular some years back and remains essential to the variation today. As regards move-orders, the game's 10 'ii'h4 is less frequently played than 10 i.e3, perhaps because of the response 10 ... h6 (D). Then the simple idea of ... gS can be a prob- lem in various lines, especially since the retreat w 'iWh3 runs into ... g4, and ~d4 might subject the queen to discovered attack.

8 Irregular Openings and Initial Moves
In this series, I've focused primarily upon what I call the 'important' openings, which are gen- erally the ones used most, but also on those that have an established history of practice. In this chapter I'll devote some time to a discussion of irregular openings, and then look at unusual first moves in detail. I'm using the adjective 'ir- regular' to denote openings that are not fre- quently employed by master players, but still enjoy a following on lower levels. Sometimes such openings are called 'unorthodox'; that isn't such a bad word, but from the point of view of strategy, 'unorthodox' techniques can still be popular ones, whereas certain 'orthodox' treat- ments of positions fall into relative disuse (per- haps because they are too easy to meet). For example, the Trompowsky Attack 1 d4 ttJf6 2 .tg5 has become popular and universally ac- cepted, but one could argue that 2 .tg5 itself is not an 'orthodox' move; on the flip side, the form of the Torre Attack with 1 d4 d5 2 ttJf3 ttJf6 3 .tg5 is orthodox by the classical stan- dards of development, but it isn't very popular any more. In a similar way, classically-oriented openings such as the Ponziani Opening (1 e4 e5 2 ttJf3 ttJc6 3 c3) and the Hungarian Defence (1 e4 e5 2 ttJf3 ttJc6 3 .tc4 .te7) are orthodox in strategic terms, but rare in master practice; to- day, they could legitimately be called 'irregular'. This distinction can extend to eccentric-looking openings which were until recently irregular and have moved into the mainstream; for exam- ple, the Chebanenko Slav (1 d4 d5 2 c4 c6 3 ttJf3 ttJf6 4 ttJc3 a6). While this variation could hardly be called 'irregular' any more, being the respectable subject of books and articles, I'm still not sure who is so advanced as to call Black's strategy 'orthodox'! Of course, the ter- minology isn't terribly important; the point is that the openings I refer to as 'irregular' in this chapter aren't yet used by masters or grand- masters on an ordinary basis, although many remain stubbornly popular with average play- ers. The Appeal of the Irregular Some irregular openings are perfectly playable; others are used merely for surprise value and have limited or no logic behind them. In either case, their attraction is undeniable. The Web is surfeited with articles on various unusual ways to begin the game, and there are numerous sites solely devoted to them. If you go often enough to any chess club, or to the skittles rooms of tournaments, you'll eventually run into people who are discussing some strange and dubious opening, usually having a great time doing so. What is the appeal? First, there's something lib- erating about playing around with an opening that you haven't seen before, and having the feeling (illusory or not) that the move you're suggesting hasn't been thought of by anyone until this moment. Along the same lines, chess- players like having 'their own' special opening, be that an eccentric first move, a speculative gambit, or even something that they've in- vented. Furthermore, a lot of irregular openings have an exciting, paradoxical feel to them: you make counterintuitive moves, waste time, or sacrifice pawns, and yet some not-so-obvious factor is working in your favour to give you positive chances. It's a break from the drudgery of 'cor- rect' play and following those tired old princi- ples. Even if you don't secure the better game, you can at least irritate your opponent and pres- ent him with multiple opportunities to go wrong. The most entertaining irregular openings also contain tactical traps into which one innocent victim after another falls. It takes a confluence of forces for this to happen, but makes every- thing more fun. Then there's the issue of convenience, un- derestimated by the professionals who write chess literature. The most obvious reason to go out of the mainstream is to have something to play without needing very much preparation.
250 MASTERING THE CHESS OPENINGS
Depending upon the time you have available, getting away from your opponent's favourite opening can be a practical necessity. Just don't forget that opening preparation has benefits that go well beyond the immediately practical; as I'm constantly stressing, it will increase your understanding of middle games and of chess in general. Perhaps that's why we see so few un- compromising adherents of irregular and even out-of-the-way openings reach the top of the chess hierarchy. There are exceptions, of course, but you will find that the successful grand- masters who play anti-theoretical lines (includ- ing obscure sidelines of mainstream openings) have previously or concurrently spent years playing and studying more conventional open- ings. The knowledge and skill derived from knowing a wide variety of standard opening ideas and associated middlegames informs their use of irregular openings; it's not so clear that the reverse is true. In any case, most masters who employ unconventional openings aren't simply tossing out the moves; they have usu- ally put a great deal of time into examining their consequences. Properly motivated, this kind of investigation can increase your under- standing and playing strength, just as any other kind of opening study can. Thus, by itself, play- ing out of the mainstream shouldn't do damage to one's results; after all, a strong player can win with any opening. But playing something just because it gets you 'out of the books' prob- ably won't payoff, because your overall under- standing of how to play openings is a more important factor than the specific opening you use. Finally, the major openings have for the most part achieved their status because they tend to produce the best practical outcomes in master play. I don't believe this consideration affects the inexperienced player much, if at all, nor even the average one. Playing gambits, for example, can be very healthy for your rating at the club level. Nevertheless, as you begin to improve and play stronger opponents, the ob- jective worth of an opening takes on more sig- nificance. So there's a point at which you will want to know which irregular openings are ac- tually inferior, which are acceptable but unpop- ular, and which are easy to play. In addition, if you're going to use such an opening, you'll want it to conform to your personal tastes. We still find a widespread snobbishness about irregular openings among masters and teachers, many of whom seem to ignore the finer dis- tinctions among them. Teachers find it easy to inculcate their students with the popular open- ings they themselves are studying and playing; that is fine, but at the same time many become dismissive of everything outside the received wisdom. Thus we see juniors who feel that anything except main-line Sicilians are infe- rior (and, as a result, we see a monotonous stream of Dragons, Najdorfs and Sveshnikovs at scholastic tournaments). It turns out, however, that much of what is ir- regular today becomes conventional tomorrow. The contemporary literature on irregular and unusual moves, in both book and periodical form, is increasingly professional, much of it written by masters and grandmasters. They are discovering that more opening ideas, including old ones, are playable and can lead to rich posi- tions. By keeping an eye on such literature, you can more easily separate openings with real worth from those with only shock value. Adventures with 1 e4 It's staggering how much is going on at the most fundamental levels of opening theory. By way of example, and with an eye on ways that we might spice up our chess experiences, let me list a se- lection of unconventional variations following from the initial move 1 e4. They all arise within just the first five moves, all have been played by grandmasters, and all are good enough to be worthy of consideration for practical play. Most of them are truly irregular lines; to the extent that a couple have assumed top-level respect- ability, they have only done so recently. And, in spite of being recommended by players and theoreticians, the majority of these lines haven't gained large followings or elite approval. To be clear: I'm not including the countless ingenious new ideas that are refreshing already estab- lished openings. Rather, I am selecting very early moves that define a unique opening varia- tion. Let me begin with what is easily the most popular 1 e4 opening, the Sicilian Defence.
IRREGULAR OPENINGS AND INITIAL MOVES 251
Players on both sides of the board are discover- ing that variations previously ignored at the top levels are in fact legitimate. To put that in con- text with an older example, it's worth remem- bering that about two decades ago, 1 e4 c5 2 ttJf3 ttJc6 3 .tb5 (the Rossolimo Variation) was still considered somewhat irregular (or at best harmless), and now it has driven some grand- masters away from their lifelong preference for the move 2 ... ttJc6! As Black in the Open Sicilian, there are many irregular set-ups which now seem quite playable; for example: a) The Lowenthal Sicilian with 1 e4 c5 2 ttJf3 ttJc6 3 d4 cxd4 4 ttJxd4 e5 5 ttJb5 a6, al- lowing 6 ttJd6+. When I compare the various recent books and articles on this system, in- cluding those by grandmasters recommending particular systems for White, I see nothing to indicate that Black doesn't stand perfectly well. b) The Grivas Sicilian with I e4 c5 2 ttJf3 ttJc6 3 d4 cxd4 4 ttJxd4 'iVb6. This isn't terribly ambitious, but gives you thematic Sicilian po- sitions without requiring memorization of the ultra-critical variations of, say, Dragons and Najdorfs. A related and playable irregular sys- tem is the 'Gaw-Paw': 1 e4 c5 2 ttJf3 e6 3 d4 cxd4 4 ttJxd4 ttJf6 5 ttJc3 'iUb6, and a move ear- lier in this sequence 4 ... 'iUb6 is also used (the Kveinys Variation). c) The O'Kelly Sicilian: 1 e4 c5 2 ttJf3 a6, which is undergoing a great resurgence of inter- est. Properly handled, it consistently produces unbalanced positions in which the better player on that day will win the majority of games. d) Various lines of the amazingly flexible PaulsenlKan Sicilian. For example, 1 e4 c5 2 ttJf3 e6 3 d4 cxd4 4 ttJxd4 a6 5 .td3 g6 is still an irregular line, but has serious theoretical backing. After five moves, Black appears to have the weakest dark squares imaginable - but a playable position! Next, let me tum to some irregular early moves on the white side of the Sicilian. As White, you can have fun with slow and eccen- tric moves because of your extra tempo: a) 1 e4 c5 2 a3. This is Grandmaster Bezgo- dov's move; he has written a 200+ page book on it. White's idea (among others) is to play b4 in some lines to get a favourable form of Sicilian Wing Gambit (1 e4 c5 2 b4) while avoiding some of Black's most active defences. Each of 2 ... ttJc6, 2 ... e6 and 2 ... d6, for example, are an- swered by 3 b4. There are also elements of the English Opening reversed; for example, 2 ... g6 3 c3 !? is 1 c4 e5 2 g3 c6 with the extra a3 for White. Incidentally, there have been a number of articles about the Wing Gambit itself, and that might be another choice for the well-prepared player. b) A related, somewhat older line is 1 e4 c5 2 ttJc3 ttJc6 3 f4 g6 4 ttJf3 .tg7 5 a3. White in- tends to play b4 (especially on a move like 5 ... e6) and otherwise uses a2 as a potential re- treat-square for his bishop (for example, after 5 ... d6 6 .tc4), while holding up ... b5-b4 under some circumstances. c) 1 e4 c5 2 ttJa3 has been played by the strong and experienced grandmaster Zviagin- tsev (7 times against 2600+ rated opponents!), as well as a few other prominent grandmasters such as Malakhov and Sashikiran. This is a sound line with some surprisingly positive fea- tures. It's also a real mix-and-match. For exam- ple, White can enter into a sort of c3 Sicilian with ttJc2 or ttJc4 via a sequence such as 2 ... e6
3 c3 d5 4 e5 ttJc6 5 ttJf3 with the idea ttJc2 and
d4. Or, against 2 ... ttJc6, the Rossolimo-like 3 .tb5 leaves the Grand Prix move f4 available to be played later. Moves like 2 a3 and 2 ttJa3 will probably never become wildly popular, but they are sound lines which will doubtless see periodic usage by strong players. d) The Closed Sicilian with 1 e4 c5 2 ttJc3 ttJc63 g4. The idea is to accelerate White's ex- pansion on the kingside; normally, he plays 3 g3 and only later, g4. Another offbeat Closed Sicilian is 1 e4 c5 2 ttJc3 ttJc6 3 .tb5, used by a number of grandmasters. e) I'll also mention Vasiukov's variation 1 e4 c5 2 ttJf3 d6 3 d4 cxd4 4 'iUxd4, playing for rapid development, which is orthodox by com- parison with the ones above. This has been around for ages, and although it has never really caught on at the elite level, it has scored reason- ably well. It is also wide open to new interpreta- tions. What about 1 e4 e5? For Black, irregular old lines are being reconsidered; for example:
252 MASTERING THE CHESS OPENINGS
a) 1 e4 e5 2 ttJf3 ttJc6 3 .ltb5 g6, played by Smyslov, is an interesting alternative to the con- ventional Ruy Lopez lines. b) I e4 e5 2 ttJf3 ttJc6 3 .ltb5 f5, the Schlie- mann Defence, is still irregular but has been ap- pearing in elite practice and has much new high-level theory devoted to it. As a practical consideration, very few opponents will enter the lengthy and tactical main lines of the Schlie- mann (starting with 4 ttJc3), so you will often see modest responses, such as 4 d3, which is generally regarded as more or less equal. After I e4 e5, many of White's newer ap- proaches come well beyond the first few moves and don't define independent systems. How- ever, we do see the revival of some older lines. Remember that the Scotch Game (1 e4 e5 2 ttJf3 ttJc6 3 d4) had arguably become an 'irreg- ular' opening by the time that Kasparov revived and popularized it. Here are some other double e-pawn openings which have recently had at- tention drawn to them: a) I e4 e5 2 ttJf3 d6 3 d4 ttJf6 4 ttJc3 ttJbd7 5 g4 is Shirov's gambit in the Philidor Defence (an opening which nowadays more often arises via I e4 d6 2 d4 ttJf6 3 ttJc3 e5 4 ttJf3 ttJbd7). It continues to do well and for many players, that beats 20 moves of positional manoeuvring! b) In Chapter 7, I covered the Four Knights Game, 1 e4 e5 2 ttJf3 ttJc6 3 ttJc3 ttJf6 (this is also a possible outcome of the Petroff De- fence: 2 ttJf3 ttJf6 3 ttJc3 ttJc6). White is play- ing several 'irregular' moves following 4 .ltb5 ttJd4, whereas Black has deviated successfully before that with 4 ... .ltd6 !? A half-move earlier, White can get a fresh set of positions out of 4 a3!?, the Gunsberg Variation; this little move prepares d4 without having to worry about ... .ltb4, and tries to create new problems based upon 4 ... .ltc5?! 5 ttJxe5 and 4 ... d5 5 .ltb5. c) 1 e4 e5 2 ttJf3 ttJc6 3 .ltb5 a6 4 .i.a4 ttJf6 5 'iie2, the Worrall Attack, has never been in bad standing, but has generally been treated as an irregular variation. Now it is seeing a revival. Incidentally, various Ruy Lopez lines with 4 d3 and 5 d3 have been increasingly employed by top grandmasters. In the French Defence, Black has always had great leeway in how to bring his pieces out. For example: a) Recently, I e4 e6 2 d4 d5 3 ttJd2 is being answered by irregular moves such 3 ... h6 and 3 ... b6, even at master and grandmaster level, as well as by the better-established but still non- mainstream moves 3 ... ttJc6 and 3 ... a6. b) In the Advance Variation, after I e4 e6 2 d4 d5 3 e5, 3 ... b6 is increasingly respectable. Black can also play the odd-looking 3 ... .ltd7, which reserves the option of the normal ... c5 (when d7 is the most common square for the bishop), but also ... a6 and ... .ltb5 in the right sit- uation. c) After I e4 e6 2 d4 d5 3 ttJc3, 3 ... ttJc6 has been an irregular byway for years, but now has strong adherents and a respectable body of theory behind it. Strange to say, even 3 ... i..e7 and 3 ... h6 are being played by strong players. With regard to the latter move, the seemingly unrelated and bizarre 1 ttJf3 h6!? (the subject of intense analysis by Wind), may well have drawbacks, but it can lead to 2 e4 e6 3 d4 d5, and the pawn on h6 proves useful. Indeed, 4 ttJc3 ttJf6 is then a transposition to the French Defence variation 1 e4 e6 2 d4 d5 3 ttJc3 h6 4 ttJf3 ttJf6, a line which has been played by nu- merous masters and grandmasters. For his part, White periodically experiments with irregular moves in order to keep the play outside the main lines of the French; for exam- ple: a) On the second move, in addition to the previously irregular but now-established 1 e4 e6 2 'iie2, I e4 e6 2 b3 d5 3 .ltb2 is being seen as a provocative way to mix things up. b) 1 e4 e6 2 ttJf3 d5 3 e5 c5 4 b4 cxb4 5 a3 (or 5 d4) is the French Wing Gambit. Although infrequently used at grandmaster level, it has an earnest following below that and considerable theoretical backing. In the Caro-Kann Defence, BJack has many new ideas in established variations, but also some within the first few moves: a) 1 e4 c6 2 d4 d5 3 ttJc3 b5, with the idea 4 exd5 b4, is an old line by Gurgenidze. It is be- ing reinvestigated and seems a useful weapon. b) Against I e4 c6 2 ttJf3 d5 3 ttJc3, often a dull variation, some high-level players have used the line 3 ... ttJf6 4 e5 ttJe4. Much of the experimental action for White is taking place in the Advance Variation:
IRREGULAR OPENINGS AND INITIAL MOVES 253
a) After 1 e4 c6 2 d4 d5 3 e5 .i.f5, the varia- tions 4 .i.e3 and 4 lbd2 have gone from being wholly irregular to respectable enough that they now have numerous grandmaster practi- tioners. b) Versus 1 e4 c6 2 d4 d5 3 e5 c5, we are seeing 4 c4 and 4 lbf3 lbc6 5 c4. Up until re- cently, these moves were virtually unknown. c) The pseudo-Advance variation 1 e4 c6 2 lbe2 d5 3 e5 has drawn some high-powered at- tention of late, both in theoretical articles and grandmaster play. In the Pirc and Modern Defences, Black's flexibility is such that irregular or at least un- usual move-orders are commonplace. Essen- tially, he can play the moves ... .i.g7, ... c6, ... a6 with ... b5 and ... O-O in almost any order to keep White guessing. Several unconventional lines have recently attracted attention in the Modem Defence: a) I e4 g6 2 d4 .i.g7 3lbc3 d5!? is a surpris- ing thrust, mentioned in Chapter 3, with the idea that 4lbxd5 c6 wins back White's d-pawn, and 4 exd5 lbf6 will either do so or extract other con- cessions from White. I'm doubtful that Black can achieve real equality after 5 .i.c4 (5 h4!? in- tending 5 ... lbxd5 6 h5 could be tried) 5 ... lbbd7, but it's a position into which many strong play- ers have entered. b) A whole complex of ... a6 systems, some- times referred to as 'Tiger's Modem', can be played against White's main set-ups, especially
1 e4 g6 2 d4 .i.g7 3lbc3 d6 (even 3 ... a6 is possi-
ble) 4 lbf3 a6, 4 .i.e3 a6, and 4 f4 a6. I exam- ined these in detail in Chapter 3. White can also play outside the main lines; for example: a) He can launch early h4 attacks, the most common one going 1 e4 d6 2 d4 lbf6 3 lbc3 g6 4 .i.e2 .i.g7 5 h4. b) 1 e4 d6 2 d4lbf6 3 lbc3 g6 4 .i.e2 .i.g7 5 g4, less frequently seen, has had some success. c) In the Austrian Attack, 1 e4 d6 2 d4 lbf6 3 lbc3 g6 4 f4 .i.g7, the move 5 a3 was almost unknown a decade ago. Pushing the a-pawn avoids the standard line 5 lbf3 c5 and the large amount of theory associated with it (that is, 5 a3 c5 6 dxc5 "iVa5 allows 7 b4). 5 a3 O-O 6 lbf3 (equivalent to 5 lbf3 O-O 6 a3) is a related line which has met with some success. The Modem Variation of the Alekhine De- fence, 1 e4lbf6 2 e5 lbd5 3 d4 d6 4lbf3, is an astonishing example of the increasing interest in what had been minor sidelines. First, the top grandmasters are treating 4 ... dxe5 5lbxe5 as the main line of the entire defence (with first 5 ... g6 and more recently 5 ... c6 as the follow-up), even though it was a minor irritant just two decades ago compared to 4 ... g6 and 4 ... .i.g4. Then, on the same move, we see a distinct revival of the irregular moves 4 ... lbb6 and 4 .. . lbc6, accompa- nied by much analysis. Even Miles's unlikely- looking move 4 ... c6 has a following and contin- ues to perform reasonably well. Finally, in the Scandinavian Defence with 1 e4 d5 2 exd5 1Wxd5, so much has been discov- ered over the last decade that it's hard to distin- guish what's irregular from what isn't. As a general observation, I find it amazing that after 3 lbc3, Black's popular move 3 ... 1Wd6 was an irregular sideline just 10 years ago. It is now ar- guably the main line, especially at grandmaster level. Incidentally, it wasn't so long ago (per- haps 30 years or so) that the Scandinavian was seldom played and considered marginal by most masters. A number of older opening books even dismissed it entirely on the basis of Black's loss of time with his queen. The great Bent Larsen was instrumental in changing that assessment. In this by no means complete review, I've limited myself to 1 e4 openings, and to the first five moves; as you can imagine, a similar array of irregular lines is associated with 1 d4 open- ings. There's a feast of offerings out there. Of course, some of these ideas will prove wanting in the long run, just as new ones will appear. The real point is not to fill your repertoire with unusual openings. In fact, I personally advise against that, and believe that you willieam more about chess if you mostly play (and study) major openings. But I also think that the judicious use of some irregular variations can make your chess more fun, and stimulate you to think creatively. Responding to the Unfamiliar Of course, a lot of the time you'll be on the other side of the board when the surprising
254 MASTERING THE CHESS OPENINGS
move or variation appears. What should you do when faced with an unfamiliar opening, or even an unfamiliar move in an opening that you know? Your first reaction should be to take a deep breath and try to understand what your op- ponent is doing. Is he attacking or planning to attack any weak points? Is he preparing a cer- tain positionally desirable move? Are there any tactics involved? Once you've got a feel for the key factors of the position, you can react ac- cordingly. For example, against most slow moves that don't engage your pieces, it's appropriate to oc- cupy the centre with pawns (many irregular openings permit you to do so, which is part of the reason that they're irregular!). Then de- velop pieces towards the centre, just as you would do in the majority of openings. Of course, even if your moves are more principled than your opponent's, you shouldn't expect an imme- diate payback. The game of chess is forgiving enough that most pawn and piece deployments, however strange, can be coordinated in some logical fashion, so that the disadvantages of most irregular openings won't lead to disaster. If the situation is turning tactical or excep- tionally dynamic, you should take extra time to assess the problems and do as much calcula- tion of concrete sequences as possible. In that way, you may not be able to solve the position but you'll get a clear idea of what the issues are. You shouldn't be intimidated; after all, it's unlikely that an irregular opening will win by force, and it's quite possible that there's some serious flaw or drawback to it. Be alert and take advantage of specific mistakes. Say that you have a fair general knowledge of open- ings, but within the first few moves, your op- ponent plays a gambit that you've never seen. It's likely that the reason you haven't seen it is because you can safely accept the pawn. For example, the sequence 1 d4lZ:lf6 2 g4 has a cult following, and might make some sense in con- junction with the moves g5 and perhaps iLg2. But 2 ... lZ:lxg4 3 e4 really isn't very impressive; among others, 3 ... d6, followed by ... lZ:lf6 ifthe knight is attacked, leaves White short of com- pensation. Similarly, a gambit such as 1 d4 e5 2 dxe5 d6 should be accepted by 3 exd6; White has no weaknesses to assist Black, who has only slightly better developmental prospects. Declining such gambits lets your opponent off the hook. Assuming that the irregular opening is logi- cal and contests important squares, it's useful to keep your pawn-structure in mind. Quite often, unusual openings either come with weaknesses or they allow you to create weaknesses in your opponent's position. Regardless of the specifics, replying with common-sense moves and apply- ing what you know about analogous situations will serve you well. Assessing the Initial Moves If you look through a listing of irregular open- ings, you'll find that a majority of such openings include weakening moves, unjustified sacri- fices, or a disdain for central control. You are also confronted with an intimidating reality: ir- regular openings, even limiting ourselves to named ones, are more numerous than conven- tional ones! The cynic might say that's because there are more bad moves in chess than good ones. Indeed, when we find out that there are at least four named openings beginning with 1 a4, including 1 a4 b6 2 d4 d5 3 lZ:lc3lZ:ld7 (with the 'idea' 4lZ:lxd5 iLb7), which has been called the 'Cologne Gambit' of the 'Ware Opening', it's easy to agree with that. By the time we get to move 5, the number of 'irregular' moves ex- plodes for both sides. Rather than tackle the near-infinite subject of irregular openings in general, I thought that it would be fun and in- deed revealing to look at openings defined by the very first move. This exercise is particularly appropriate for the average player, because the logic of these openings does not depend upon prior knowledge of variations leading up to it. As it is, there's not nearly enough room to cover even these first moves in a comprehensive fash- ion. But I think that there's much to learn from how the variations break down, even if they can't be subject to detailed analysis. For many players, unusual first moves are the most attractive; after all, what's better than playing an initial move that makes your oppo- nent think? This psychological motivation has its effect, as evidenced by the number of games played with the least promising of first moves. For example, in one of my combined databases,
IRREGULAR OPENINGS AND INITIAL MOVES 255
here is the number of games (in parentheses) with the following first moves for White. In ev- ery case, numerous masters (over 2200 rating) are represented: 1 f3 (166); 1 lbh3 (231); 1 c3 (437); 1 e3 (1,190); 1 a3 (1,829); 1 g4 (2,845). Non-transpositional games with llbc3 (which is used frequently for transpositional purposes) number 9,152; and 1 b4, respectable but nowhere near mainstream, is represented by 20,689 con- tests, more than the main lines of many major openings. These figures include some joke draws and I-move contests, but not enough to have a significant effect. And, to be sure, they represent small percentages of the entirety of games. Nevertheless, given the thousands of conventional (and unconventional) variations to choose from that stem from 1 e4, 1 d4, 1 c4 and llbf3, I'm surprised that tournament play- ers are inclined to choose those above so fre- quently. And you should keep in mind that these numbers would surely balloon if you in- cluded amateur and club games (which are for the most part absent from standard databases). So what are the characteristics of these first- move openings? First, it's useful to classify them according to evaluation. I'll call some openings' good enough' (if they were worthy of an unqualified 'good', they'd probably not be irregular!), others 'substandard', and still oth- ers 'bad'. 'Bad' and 'good enough' are readily understandable categories; I'll get more spe- cific on a case-by-case basis. A 'substandard' opening is generally uninspiring and tends to produce below-average results. This kind of opening is functional at lower levels, especially if it's tricky and has surprise value; however, a substandard opening becomes difficult to han- dle as you come up against stronger opponents. Of course, any assessment depends upon what you expect to get out of the opening. I often hear advocates of irregular openings for White bragging about how their opening 'hasn't been refuted'. That's not a very good criterion! After all, it takes some pretty poor play for White to actually come out of the opening with a disad- vantage, and when White goes through contor- tions merely to reach equality, we shouldn't be impressed. To the extent that the opening is harmless, easy to play, and leaves White with the ability to pose as many problems as Black, that's 'good enough'. But if, in practice, the opening is more difficult for White to play than Black and also doesn't yield any advantage, it qualifies as 'substandard' . When it's Black who is playing an irregular opening, my assessments are naturally more forgiving. If Black can achieve a normal (i.e. very slight) disadvantage with perfect play, that's probably 'good enough'. An exception might be when the resulting position, although theoretically only moderately worse, requires a sophisticated handling that is out of the range of the average player. For example, Black may come out of the opening with quasi-permanent weaknesses or horrible-looking doubled pawns. A top player might know how to play around them, find a complex way to liquidate them, or even use them productively. However, if that in- volves extremely refined moves and/or extraor- dinary accuracy, then the opening isn't really satisfactory in practical terms and I'd call it 'substandard'. You can see that my evaluation isn't perfectly objective, and it is skewed to- wards the 'average' player, which in this case covers the broad range from developing players to experienced ones who are nevertheless be- low master level. It turns out that everything has a name, and usually multiple names. For example, according to irregular openings aficionado Eric Schiller, the "greatest living exponent" of the move 1 h4 is the Hungarian master Kadas, after whom he names the opening, but he points out that it is also known as the 'Desprez Opening' and the 'Reagan Attack'. This reflects the fact that chess-players crave immortality; it also con- firms the old saw that 'bad publicity is better than no pUblicity' . Curious, I went to my large combined database and found 354 non-trivial games with 1 h4, including 23 games by a fel- low named Ats, which swamped the number by his countryman Kadas or anyone else. A num- ber of masters have used 1 h4, among their ranks even a couple of 2400+ players. It some- how didn't surprise me that the overall success rate of 1 h4 was only moderately lower than White gets in chess overall. In over-the-board play, versus Black's replies 1...d5 and 1...lbf6, White has a typical edge over Black in raw score and performance rating, but he does quite
256 MASTERING THE CHESS OPENINGS
poorly in both respects versus 1...e5. In corre- spondence play, White does reasonably well ex- cept when playing against 1...d5, which scores exceptionally well for Black. Remarkably, look- ing through the games themselves, I didn't find any in which h4 made a significant contribution to an opening advantage for White! I suppose that should be no surprise either: on a lower or even average level of play, I h4 can be used without disastrous consequences, because both sides' more serious mistakes later will easily outweigh the disadvantages of the first move. Nevertheless, I believe most leading grand- masters would assess White's game after I h4 as already inferior. If nothing else, it's a major concession when you forfeit the possibility of castling kingside in a large majority of posi- tions. In addition, the g4-square will often be occupied by an active black piece that will be hard to get rid of, because the move f3 would create further weaknesses. If we had a large sample of games between master players, I'm convinced that I h4 would score considerably below 50%, and trail significantly in perfor- mance rating. In my judgement, then, I h4 is simply 'bad'. To get a feel for the consequences of the choice of first move (and have some fun), let's run through every initial move for White, and a selected group of them for Black. First of all, the 'regular' first moves I e4, I d4 and I c4 all occupy and/or control central squares without exposing the king or creating weaknesses. Ilbf3 controls two central squares and develops in a way that is compatible with a wide range of good systems for White. These four moves are indisputably good ones. Continuing with moves for White, both first- move fianchettoes I g3 and I b3 are logical and safe. Having studied 1. .. g6, we can infer that 1 g3 must be satisfactory. Most of the time, it transposes to openings such as the English Opening and Reti, or to any number of d-pawn openings featuring a fianchetto by White. But 1 g3 has also been played in many games which haven't transposed into other variations; for ex- ample, it often becomes a reversed Pirc De- fence such as I g3 d5 2 i.g2 e5 3 d3 c6 (or 3 ... lbc6) 4 lbf3. The same comparison holds for I b3 (which we looked at in Chapter 4), since it is an 'improved' 1...b6. Both 1 g3 and 1 b3 are a bit too passive to produce an advantage against solid play, but that's a different issue. Similarly, the Bird Opening (1 f4) was exam- ined in Chapter 6. It has a longer history of master play and is clearly sound. That leaves what I consider truly irregular first moves, divided by colour. We begin with White. Most of White's irregular first moves are 'good enough', even though some of them are passive and fail to challenge Black at all. The only reason that some of those survive 'substandard' status is that they are not partic- ularly difficult to play. A few irregular first moves have positive qualities, and are suffi- ciently attractive to recommend for the occa- sional experiment, and I'll start with those: Sokolsky/Polish: 1 b4 As discussed above, this is the most popular and respectable of the irregular first moves. To the untrained eye, it may seem a bit bizarre. Yet several books, including two very recent ones, are solely devoted to 1 b4, which is called, vari- ously, the Sokolsky Opening, the Polish Open- ing, the Orang-Utan, and probably a few other things. 1 b4 is obviously good enough; it will probably never break through on the grandmas- ter level, but it can lend a lively flavour to the game and deserves special attention. With that in mind, here are two games in very critical variations, with notes to indicate a few other di- rections.
1 b4 (D)
Schiffler - Skirl corr. 1950 What's the idea behind this move? First and foremost, White wants to fianchetto his bishop, as he does when he plays I b3. In addition, he takes some queenside space and discourages the move ... c5. In some cases, White will play b5, and the mere possibility of that move can dissuade Black from playing ... lbc6. As we have seen following I b3 and 2 i.b2, White can develop in a variety of ways. Most frequently, he plays e3, lbf3 and c4, but a double fianchetto by g3 and i.g2 is also possible. Sometimes
IRREGULAR OPENINGS AND INITIAL MOVES 257
B
White will play f4 before developing his knight to f3, in order to strengthen his control of the long diagonal. Black is also flexibly situated. First, there's a decent chance that ... eS or : .. e6, attacking the b-pawn, will gain a whole tempo without a meaningful concession. Since White isn't plac- ing a pawn in the centre, Black frequently takes the opportunity to do so himself by ... dS and/or ... eS. He also faces no serious threats, so he can pick from a number of set-ups and develop quickly.
1...e5
I'm going to focus on this thematic move, which attacks the pawn on b4, since it is by far the most frequently played, as well as the best chance to 'refute' I b4, in the sense of giving Black the better game by force. That mayor may not happen with best play, but White has to be careful in many lines.

Here White has traded a flank pawn for a centre pawn, usually an advantage in chess (think of all the gambits in which one side sac- rifices a flank pawn in order to gain a central majority). In fact, we might compare White's strategy with the Sicilian Defence, in which Black willingly falls behind in development in order to secure the extra central pawn. How- ever, there are a couple of flaws in this compari- son. First, after Black wins a tempo on the bishop on e5 with ... ~e8 and/or ... ttJc6, he owns the dangerous e-file, which aims through the thickets at White's king. That is significant be- cause White is so far away from castling (a con- sequence of spending time on the moves b4, .ltb2, .ltxe5 and .ltb2). Furthermore, there are idiosyncratic qualities to this variation, in which the particulars often trump general consider- ations. For one, White's d-pawn is pinned, which makes d3 impossible for the moment and, as we shall see, creates some awkward de- fensive problems on e3. Furthermore, White's bishop is committed to the long diagonal and can get shut out of play by ... d5-d4. In what fol- lows, you'll see many examples of the attack- ing chances these factors produce. 5• • J':!.e8 This presages some tactical ideas. Naturally, Black has other options: a) Sometimes he attacks with 5 ... ttJc6, which is reasonable, but it's nice to retain the option of ... c5; for example, if White doesn't play c4, then Black can set up with ... d5 and ... c5, as in 'b'. b) 5 ... d5 6 .lte2 c5 7 O-O ttJc6 8 i.b2 (D) is a well-known position.

For example, 9 c4!?

Al- though the move hasn't ever inspired a tidal wave of interest, it has a solid reputation and a number of strong adherents, with periodic use by grandmasters. Even the chess stars Moroze- vich and Ivanchuk have given it a whirl. In fact, whole books with extensive analysis have been devoted to the intricacies of llZ'lc3. I shall only present one game including a general outline of early moves, but you will see how ex- traordinarily rich a set of ideas can spring from the knight development. Of the irregular first moves presented in this chapter, it might well be the most fruitful to play and study. For one thing, the pawn-structures that result are often related to those in mainstream openings. A. van den Berg - Liubarsky European Seniors Ch, Arvier 2004 llZ'lc3 (D) White's basic notion is that llZ'lc3 is a flexi- ble centralizing move that looks out at e4 and dS, just as 1lZ'lf3 controls d4 and eS. Depending upon Black's reply, White can either transpose to more conventional openings or find a forma- tion in which the knight on c3 serves a useful
B
function. This is best explained by example, as are Black's counter-strategies. 1 .•. e5 1 lZ'lc3 can lead to an outrageous number of potential transpositions and original paths, which makes it rather attractive if you want to try something new on the first move. I'll just present a tree-structure overview with a limited selection of starting points. Keep in mind that a good deal of theory is attached to some of the following variations: a) 1...dS (D) is the main alternative to 1...eS, and introduces the idea of ... d4. w Now 2 lZ'lf3 can lead in various directions; for example, 2 ... d4 3 lZ'le4lZ'lf6 4 d3!? A funny reversed line would be 2 ... cS 3 d4 cxd4 4 li'xd4, which is a Queen's Gambit Declined, Chigorin Defence, with the extra tempo lZ'lf3; there might follow 4 ... lZ'lf6 S e4!? lZ'lc6 6 iLbS iLd7 7 iLxc6 iLxc6 8 exdS lZ'lxdS 9 O-O.

(D).

White attacks Black's pawn on dS directly, and challenges him to exchange, advance, or transpose into a conventional opening. Here are some possibilities: a1) 2 ... e6 is a French Defence. White can transpose to main lines by 3 d4, or play the less popular variation with 3 ltJf3. Moves such as 3 g3 and 3 f4 are playable, but unimpressive. a2) Similarly, 2 ... c6 3 d4 is a main-line Caro-Kann. White has the option of a Two Knights Variation by 3 ltJf3, and a number of unusual tries such as 3 'iff3 d44 .i.c4!? ltJf6! S eSltJbd7!? 6 exf6ltJeS 7 .i.xf7+, when neither recapture is particularly clear. a3) 2 ... ltJf6 is a line of the Alekhine De- fence by transposition: 1 e4 ltJf6 2 ltJc3 dS. This is looked upon as relatively harmless after 3 exdS ltJxdS or 3 eS ltJfd7. Sometimes Black meets 3 eS with 3 ... ltJe4!?, when the most criti- cal move is 4 ltJce2, by which White prepares, with d3, to drive Black's knight away with tempo; or he can play d4 and threaten to win the knight on e4 by f3. All of this can be found in theoretical works and databases. a4) 2 ... dxe4 3ltJxe4 (D) is commonly seen, with the usual wide choice for Black: a41) Strangely, 3 ... 'iVdS 4ltJc3!? is the same position that arises from 1 e4 dS 2 exdS 'iVxdS 3 ltJc3, a Scandinavian Defence! a42) 3 ... .i.fS and now 4 'iVf3!? has the idea, hardly forced, of 4 ... 'iVdS SltJd6+ 'iVxd6 6 'iixfS.

The position after 3 ... eS has been contested quite often between strong players. White nor- mally proceeds with one of two strategies, First,

w he can set up with d3, g3, ii.g2, ttJf3 and O-O, re- versing a King's Indian position; or better yet, he can get f4 in before ttJf3. The latter requires accuracy to implement; for example, the imme- diate 4 f4!? (rather than the normal 4 d3) can run into 4 ... ttJc6 5 ttJf3 ii.g4!, when instead of 6 d3? ii.xf3 7 gxf3 "iVh4+ 8 ..t>d2 exf4 9 c3 O-O-O, as in Ardaman-Yermolinsky, Philadelphia 2002, White should consider 6 ttJxe5.

(9 ... ii.M+! 1O..t>f2 ttJe7) 10 ~d2! ii.d6 11 ~g5, as in Sydor-Kapengut, Lublin 1973. White has the bishop-pair and mobile kingside pawns to compensate for his lack of space and poorly- placed pieces. White's second main idea is get his bishop out to c4 or b5 in front of the pawn-chain (that is, before closing it in with d3); for example, 4 ttJg3 ii.e6!

will find many such transpositions after 1 tDc3 that are theoretically harmless; still, White may be able to move his opponent into unfamiliar territory by employing them. A refreshing alternative is 2 d4!? exd4 3 'iVxd4, which is a reversed Scandinavian De- fence with an extra tDc3. This leads to distinc- tive positions; for example, 3 ... tDc6 (3 ... tDf6 4 g4!? is a bizarre idea from C.Horvath-Lukacs, Budapest 1994: 4 ... tDc6 S "iVe3+ i.e7 6 gS tDg4 7 'iVe4 tDb4 8 tDdS tDxdS 9 'iVxdS, and now 9 .. .f6 is best, since in the game 9 ... d6? 10 f4! deprived the knight of squares) and now: a) 4 ~d3 tDf6, as in the 3 .. :iVd6 Scandina- vian, is of course playable, but not so impres- sive with a knight on c3, preventing the move c3. The popular idea of a3 and b4 doesn't go that well with tDc3, which blocks off White's long al-h8 diagonal. Nevertheless, an extra tempo is an extra tempo, and White might want to investigate independent ideas such as S tDf3 i.b4 6 i.gS h6 7 i.h4 O-O 8 O-O-O. b) 4 ~a4 tDf6 (4 ... dS S tDf3 has the idea S. .. tDf66 i.gS i.b4 7 O-O-O! i.xc3 8 bxc3 h6 9 'iVh4) S tDf3 i.cs 6 i.gS h6 7 i.h4 gS 8 i.g3 d6

In fact, the move a3 can be useful in the 1 e4 e5 openings and the Sicilian Defence; there's even a whole book on 1 e4 c5 2 a3, as mentioned ear- lier in the chapter. However, if played on the first move, there are too many lines in which it is hardly relevant. For example, the 'irregular- move killer' 1...g6 makes you wonder why any- one would trade a3 for ... g6. White could argue that after 2 c4, there are many lines in which a3 will eventually prove useful, but that's a little lame. More ambitiously, Neil McDonald tried to solve this problem by means of 1 a3 g6 2 f4!? i..g7 (2 ... e5!? would be a strange spin-off of the From Gambit) 3 tbf3 d5 4 g3, a reversed Le- ningrad Dutch Defence with an additional a3, which is interesting but no more than equal. Of course, a properly-handled 1...d5 can also ren- der 1 a3 harmless. b) 1 e3 has little going for it in a positive sense, but it's trouble-free, since 2 d4 can always follow, and 2 f4 with a Bird Opening is often possible. After 1...e5, French Defence players might like 2 d4, and English Opening players 2 c4; also, 2 b3 would be an Owen Defence reversed with the normal move e3 included. Against 1...d5, 2 d4 will probably become a Colle Opening or Queen's Gambit Semi-Tar- rasch, whereas others might like 2 f4 or 2 b3. And so forth; the point is that, while 1 e3 is a thoroughly uninspired move, and I'm not rec- ommending it, it isn't 'substandard' or 'bad'. c) 1 d3 is slightly more conventional in spirit, because White can slip into default Pirc De- fencelKing's Indian Attack mode by 2 tbf3, 3 g3, 4 i..g2 and 50-0. Otherwise, the cornme~ts about 1 e3 apply here too. d) 1 c3, sometimes called the Saragossa Opening, commits White rather early on. This
270 MASTERING THE CHESS OPENINGS
rather pathetic-looking move has been associ- ated with the truly abysmal 'iVc2, but if White keeps wasting time in that manner, Black really will stand better. So 2 d4 should probably fol- low. As applies to 1 e3, Black can play almost anything, but 1...e5 2 d4 exd4 3 cxd4 d5 is a form of the Exchange QGD that is harmless to Black, and 1...d5 suggests itself, because then 2 d4 is equivalent to the anaemic 1 d4 d5 2 c3, 2 lLIf3 lLIf6 doesn't inspire, and otherwise Black has nothing to fear. The following two fIrst moves may in some theoretical sense be adequate, but will be diffi- cult to handle and are somewhere between good enough and substandard: e) I a4 strikes me as playable, much more so than 1 h4, although I can't particularly rec- ommend it. You can generally pick conserva- tive openings in which a4 tends to be useful, or is at least not harmful. Let's see how this might go. My own sense is that King's Indian AttaclF set-ups are compatible with a4; for example, 1 a4 d5 2lL1f3 c5 3 g3 lLIc6 4 i.g2 e5 5 d3 (the equivalent of I a4 e5 2 d3 d5 3 g3 c5 4 ~g2 lLIc6 5lL1f3) is a King's Indian in which, regard- less of whether Black plays for ... f6, ... lLIf6, ... i.e7 and ... i.g4 or otherwise, White's move e4 will at some point (perhaps after lLIa3 or lLIbd2) secure the use of c4. There are any number of move-orders for both sides, of course and Black by no means has to commit to either ... c5 or ... e5 when he plays 1 ... d5, nor White to lLIf3. But I think there are clever ways for White to squeeze at least some utility out of the inclusion of a4. Versus 1...e5, White can play in similar fash- ion with a reversed Pirc Defence (2 d3, 3lL1f3, 4 g3, etc.), or even a Philidor-style formation, get- ting a playable game in which a4 can help his cause somewhat. There are more provocative ways to set up. After I a4 e5, for example, it seems to me that 2lL1f3, a reversed Alekhine De- fence, is a legitimate try; many variations of the Alekhine utilize the move ... a5, as you can verify by going through the main lines, although natu- rally Black can benefIt too (versus lines with lLIc3, for example, ... ~b4 might be useful). Don't get me wrong: I a4 is basically only a waiting move and you have little positive rea- son to play it. It allows instant equality, which White shouldn't really concede to Black on the first move. For Black, the possibility of coming to an actual disadvantage is reduced dramati- cally, almost regardless of what his first move is; in that sense, I a4 isn't really to be played except as a matter of fancy. I should also note that against I a4, 1 ... g6 is a sound and useful re- ply. That will apply to many other irregular first, second and third moves as well. I made the same point in Volume 3, when talking about irregular moves in the English Opening. f) 1 lLIa3 is defInitely ugly, but not so bad. I actually played many games with it as a 2100+ player. Against l...e5, I liked to try 2 lLIf3!?, when 2 ... i.xa3 3 bxa3 is a double-edged deci- sion, since White gains the bishop-pair and b- fIle and, as noted elsewhere, doubled a-pawns tend not to be much of a problem until the end- game. Moreover, the move lLIa3 sometimes proves useful in the reversed Alekhine Defence positions after 2 ... e4 3 lLId4, because the move c4 can justify some otherwise marginal forma- tions. Versus 1 ... d5, White can pI ay 2lL1f3 (2 c4 is safe but less flexible); for example, 2 ... c5 3 c4 or 2 ... lLIf6 3 b3 (or 3 c4). IlLIa3 c5 2 e4 is a Zviagintsev Sicilian, which turns out to be per- fectly respectable; White can also play 2 lLIf3 . Finally, as always, 1 ... g6 is quite satisfactory. The rationale given by some books for IlLIa3 is that the knight will be re-routed to c2 after White plays c3; that is rather sad-looking, however. A more interesting course for White against 1 ... g6 is to set up with e4, d4 and c3 and await the chance for a profItable lLIc4. I won't go into more details about this eccentric knight devel- opment, but you can probably put together enough ideas to elevate it to the 'good enough' category. Finally, we have some moves that I'll assess as simply 'bad': g) The unpalatable 1 lLIh3 simply puts the knight on a bad square from which it will soon have to move again. In contrast to IlLIa3, White cannot normally permit his h-pawns to be dou- bled after ... i.xh3. If he prevents that with g3, the knight is still subject to attack by ... h5-h4 or the queen and bishop along the h3-c8 diagonal. Normally one might be able to use this knight productively to support the move f4, but here that will dangerously weaken White's kingside. It's hard to argue with 1...e5 as a response, but
1...d5 2 g3 e5 is the obvious course, when 3

.itg2lZ'lc64 O-O? h5! is not what White wants! Another logical set-up is 3 ... lZ'lf6 4 d3 c6. h) I h4 is described above. It has no redeem- ing value that I've found. i) I h3, Basman's Opening, moves a rook's pawn for no reason, except perhaps to play 2 g4, with a transposition to I g4 below. True, I h3 doesn't create as serious a weakness as I h4. On the kingside, however, every situation tends to be more delicate; after I a3, for example, an early c4 is often desirable. After I h3, by con- trast, White would court disaster by playing the mirror-image move f4. A more serious problem for White is that I h3 wastes a tempo and essen- tially hands the advantage of the first move to Black. That's because, unlike most slow first moves by White, it doesn't go with or support many (if any) logical piece deployments. That is, if Black plays l...d5 or l...e5, it's unlikely that White will be able to arrive at a position in which h3 is useful without making concessions elsewhere. j) I f3 is sometimes used to set up strange formations with, for example, 'it>f2, g3 and e3, and sometimes White plays g3 and lZ'lh3-f2. Unfortunately, I f3 does more than forfeit the advantages of the first move. It hurts White's future chances for occupying the centre with pawns (for example, e4 exposes White along the a7-g1 diagonal), and it is highly inflexible (weakening the king's protection and taking a good square from White's king's knight). Grob: 1 g4 I g4 (D) This is called Grob's Attack, or 'The Spike'. It has a serious following, and has stimulated considerable analysis in articles, chapters of books, and even small books by strong players. Indeed, calling I g4 'bad' is bound to offend some fans of the opening. But at best, with proper play for both sides, White squanders any . chance at a first-move advantage, and usually finds himself the one who has to find the more difficult moves in order to reach equality. That in itself is at least a substandard situation. But I'd go further and say that White can't even equalize against best play. It would be interest- ing to see if most grandmasters agree with that,
B
or merely find it difficult and impractical to play. At any rate, because of the cultish status of I g4, here's a serious look at some of the most critical lines. I g4 8a5man - Kudrin Manchester 1981 White has the same basic goals as in the Sokolsky/Polish with I b4. He will fianchetto quickly and at the same time grab some king- side territory; this is obviously more ambitious than I g3. It also has terrible drawbacks: by not covering h4 and encouraging a timely ... h5, White reduces his chance of castling kingside. If he plays for e4, as he might in the King's In- dian Attack (which includes g3), he creates an- other hole on f4. In addition, the move g5 is often forced and can expose his position fur- ther. By contrast, in the Sokolsky, the move b5 can serve to cramp Black's game.
1. •. dS (D)
I'm going to concentrate upon this reply for the same reasons as I focused on 1.. .e5 versus I b4: it is the most popular move, directly at- tacks g4, and can be played with the hope of a forced advantage for Black. Of course, Black can go for the same goal with the naturall ... e5. I won't go into the details, but one very attrac- tive approach for him after 2 .itg2 (2 d3, per- haps best, is usually answered by 2 ... d5, but 2 h3?! h5! is already awkward for White) is 2 ... h5! 3 gxh5 (3 d4 hxg4 4 dxe5lZ'lc6 has fared no better) 3 .. :i*'g5. Then 4 .itf3 'iVh4! 5lZ'lc3 (5 d3) 5 ... lZ'lf6 is already in Black's favour, and 6 e4? (6 d3 c6) 6 ... .itc5 7 d4!? .itxd4 8 'iVe2

.ll.xc3+ 9 bxc3 tbxhS made things worse in Skembris-Mariotti, Budva 1981. w 21Lg2 This is the traditional move, introducing a sort of gambit in which White hopes to put pressure on Black's d-pawn via c4; he usually regains the pawn soon. If this fianchetto, con- sistent with the purported aggressiveness of 1 g4, doesn't work, that's a very bad sign for the Grob. The passive alternative 2 h3 will transpose into our main game if Black chooses 2 ... eS 3 .ll.g2 c6. He can also play 3 ... tbc6, which has a good record. Then Basman-Miles, Manchester 1981 tested the consistent move 4 c4!?, but Black gained the advantage after 4 ... dxc4 S ~a4 tbe7 6 tbf3!? (6 'ii'xc4 .ll.e6 is very awk- ward; for example, 7 'YWa4 'ii'd4! 8 'iVdl 'YWd7 9 tbc3 hS 10 gS O-O-O) 6 ... tbg6 7 tbc31Le6 8 h4?! (but White is already a pawn down with the in- ferior position) and here, instead of Miles's (perfectly good) move 8 ... .ll.b4, 8 ... tbf4! 91Ln 'iYd7 would be extremely strong. Perhaps White should resign himself to the passive 4 d3, but then it's difficult to justify 1 g4 with its atten- dant weaknesses. 2 ..• c6 Black simply blocks the long diagonal and maintains the threat of ... 1Lxg4; White will find it hard to justify the move g4 in the result- ing structures. Nevertheless, in my opinion, 2 ... .ll.xg4! provides a good reason for con- demning White's move-order. There follows 3 c4 c6 (D) (3 ... d4!? is called the Romford Gam- bit; given the excellent alternatives, this spec- ulative exchange sacrifice isn't recommended, but leads to a fun position following 4 .ll.xb7 tbd7 S .ll.xa8 ~xa8, when White must go in for

In addition, his half-open b-file is more important than White's g-file; for example, 8lbc3 e6 9 d3lbc6 10 lbf3 l:!b8, etc. b22) 6 lbc3 e6 (6 ... lbc6!? has the ideas 7 'iVxb7l:.c8! or 7lbxd5 'ifd7, transposing to line 'bl'; 6 ... 'iVd7 is an immediate transposition to that same line) 7 'ifxb7 lbbd7 8 lbb5 l:.c8, Polliotto-Figeac, Montpellier 1998. Black has a lead in development, and if White grabs a pawn by 9 'ifxa7 (9lbxa7? l:.b8 10 'ifa6l:.b6 11 'ifa4 'iVa8!), that lead expands; for example, 9 ... i..c5 10 ~a4 O-O 11 d4 i..e7 12 i..d2 lbb6 13 ~3 lbc4 with great pressure. I suspect that 2 ... i..xg4! constitutes a virtual refutation of 1 g4 d5 2 i..g2. It doesn't bode well for White that Black has so many options which appear to give him the advantage. The game's 2 ... c6 (D) remains relevant, how- ever, since it can transpose to 2 h3 e5 3 i..g2 c6, and in any case it produces standard pawn- structures whose understanding is relevant to several mainstream openings. w 3h3 Surprisingly, White is at a loss for realistic alternatives: a) 3 c4? loses a pawn to 3 ... dxc4. b) Sometimes 3 e4? is suggested, but the re- ply 3. .. lbf6! is already very good for Black: 4 exd5 (4 e5 lbxg4 5 d4 g6) 4 ... i..xg4 5 dxc6 lbxc6 and he dominates the centre, in addition to having better development and a superior pawn-structure. c) 3 g5?! is awfully loosening, and one good answer is 3 ... h6! 4 h4 hxg5 5 hxg5 .l::i.xhl 6 i..xh 1 'ifc7, which threatens ... ~h2 and intends 7 lbf3 e5 with ... e4 in store. Of course, Black can also play 3 ... e5. 3•.• e5 (D) As if this position weren't difficult enough for White, he also has to be ready for 3 ... h5!? 4 g5 e5, when 5 d4 is probably best, as in the main line. 4d4 This provocative move tries to justify g4 by luring Black's pawns forward. 4 d3 doesn't challenge the centre and compels White to at- tend to his kingside weaknesses; for example,

w 4 ... tbe7 (contemplating ... tbg6-h4; 4 ... hS is also good when, in order to avoid split pawns, S gS is probably best, but the resulting position after S. .. i.d6 or S. .. i.e6 can't be attractive) S tbf3 tbg6 6 tbc3 hS 7 gxhS (7 gS lets Black play ... i.e6 without worrying about tbgS) 7 ... tbh4 8 tbxh4 ~xh4 9 e4 d4 10 tbe2 'iVxhS with the better pawn-structure. 4 ... e4 This is played most often, although with White's weaknesses, it should come as no sur- prise that more restrained moves also do well. For example, 4 ... exd4!? S ~xd4 tbd7 has an ex- cellent practical score. 4 ... tbd7 is also convincing: S c4!? (White gambits a pawn; otherwise, how does he gain any activity for his pieces?

Even if you're satisfied with the game's main line, which is hardly likely, Black's many early alternatives should prove discouraging. As far as I can tell, 1 g4 is competitive with 1 h4 for the honour of being White's worst first move . Against an informed or skilled opponent, it is simply masochistic. Universal First Moves for Black Since the quality of Black's first move depends upon White's, we shall have to talk about indi- vidual cases. But some first moves have a 'uni- versal' character, in that they can be played against any first move by White. For example,
1...g6, while thought of as eccentric and/or in-
ferior in the past, is now an approved way to an- swer 1 e4, 1 d4 and 1 c4 (see Chapter 3). The acceptance of 1...b6 has taken longer, and it is
276 MASTERING THE CHESS OPENINGS
still viewed askance in some quarters, although that mainly applies to the I e4 b6 lines (see Chapter 4). Probably l...b6 can be given the as- sessment of 'good enough', but it's a bit more marginal than 1.. .g6. 1\vo other irregular opening moves, 1.. .d6 and l...ttJc6, can be played as universal systems. They aren't seen a great deal at top levels, but are effective enough to have grandmaster adherents. In part, that's because Black can pick and choose against which of White's first moves to play in- dependently, and against which to transpose into conventional openings. I should mention that playing these systems will repeatedly expose you to ideas and manoeuvres that crop up in mainstream openings, and of course mainstream opening ideas inform the use of all four universal systems that I've mentioned. Black Plays 1 ... d6
1. .. d6 has long been used as a transpositional
device but has grown into an independent weapon against 1 d4. Recently, strong players have used l...d6 with increasing frequency and promoted it in books and DVDs. Let me outline some possibilities: 1 d4 a) 1 e4 d6 is the Pirc Defence, a mainstream opening. Some players like to use the Pirc move-order to get to Philidor Defence-related systems, via 1 e4 d6 2 d4 ttJf6 3 ttJc3 e5, when 4 dxe5 dxe5 5 'iYxdS+ <;2;>xdS has thus far proven of little value for White, with 6 .tc4 adequately answered by 6 ... <;2;>eS or 6 ... .te6. b) 1 c4 d6 can lead to any number of varia- tions from Volume 3. In whatever order White plays ttJc3, g3 and/or ttJf3, Black can enter ei- ther a Reversed Closed Sicilian with ... e5 or a Symmetrical English with ... c5. He can also playa King's Indian set-up with ... ttJf6, ... g6 and ... .tg7. 1.. .d6 provides a particular type of flexibility in ... e5 systems; that is, if he is not committed to ... ttJf6, he can still play .. .f5. See, for example, the Volume 3 discussion of 1 c4 e5 2 ttJc3 d6 with 3 ttJf3 f5 and 3 g3 f5. c) 1 ttJf3 d6 is likewise very flexible and will often transpose to an English Opening af- ter White's c4. If White plays for a King's In- dian Attack by 2 g3, Black can play, among other set-ups, ... e5 & ... f5, ... c5 & ... e5, "'ttJf6 & ... g6, or simply ... g6 & ... Ji..g7 with Modem Defence themes. Finally, 2 d4 Ji..g4 transposes to 1 d4 d6 2 ttJf3 Ji..g4. w
1. .. d6 (D)
2 ttJf3 Or: a) 2 g3 e5 3 dxe5 (3 .tg2 f5) 3 ... dxe5 4 'iYxdS+ <;2;>xdS is regarded as perfectly safe for Black. A bishop on g2 can be opposed by ... c6. b) 2 c4 e5 (some players prefer 2 ... ttJf6 3 ttJc3 e5; 2 ... g6 will usually transpose into a Modem Defence or King's Indian Defence af- ter 3 e4 or 3 ttJc3) 3 ttJf3 (again, 3 dxe5 dxe5 4 'iUxdS+ <;2;>xdS is considered equal; 3 ttJc3 is a transposition to the English Opening - see Vol- ume 3 under the move-order 1 c4 e5 2 ttJc3 d6 3 d4) 3 ... e4 (there are options like 3"'ttJd7, but this is the most attractive move) 4 ttJg5 f5 5 ttJc3. This is covered in Volume 3 via the move- order 1 c4 e5 2 ttJc3 d6 3 ttJf3 f5 4 d4 e4 5 ttJg5. According to theory, Black stands reasonably well. 2 ... Ji..g4 Black announces his willingness to part with the bishop-pair in the interest of central control. Alexander Finkel has championed 2 ... g6 3 c4 Ji..g7 4 ttJc3 .tg4 5 e3 c5, with pressure down the al-hS diagonal, including ideas of ... cxd4 and ... ttJh6-f5. Perhaps that's objectively the best non-transpositional system, and it's also a good practical choice because Black's strategy is easy to implement.

g4-bishop, Black wants to be assured of getting ... e5 or ... c5 in. The alternative 3 ... ~xf3 looks premature, but is playable; for example, 4 gxf3 (4 exf3 g6 5 lbc3 ~g7 6 ~e3 lbf6 7 ~e2 c6 has been played in many grandmaster games; Black counts upon White's relatively immobile pawn-structure to compensate for the bishop- pair) 4 ... g6 (or 4 ... c6, having in mind ... e6 and ... d5 in some cases) 5lbc3 ~g7 6 f4!? lbc6 and White has usually chosen 7 e3, but there is also 7 d5. Probably White has the better prospects in all of these ... ~xf3 lines, but the positions are unbalanced and reward good play. 4lbc3 Upon 4 g3 ~xf3 5 exf3, one route is 5 ... g6 (or 5 ... e6 6lbc3lbgf6) 6 ~g2 ~g7 7 O-O lbh6 with the idea ... lbf5. Compare what follows, where Black's bishop is more passively placed on e7. White can prevent doubled pawns by 4 'i¥b3 (protecting f3 while attacking b7); then 4 ... l:i.b8 5 h3 ~xf3 6 1i'xf3 g6 and ... ~g7 again gives Black active play. His usual plan is ... c5, trying to extend the range of his dark-squared bishop. 4 ... e5 (D) Some grandmasters play 4 ... ~xf3 here. Ver- sus either recapture, 5 ... g6 and 6 ... ~g7 is a good way to contest the central dark squares. White will generally control more space, how- ever, and can claim a small advantage in most lines. 5 g3 White agrees to take on doubled pawns in re- turn for the bishop-pair and easy development.
5 e3 lbgf6 6 ~e2 is less ambitious, although it
can lead to complex strategic struggles. Black's most popular method of play is then 6 ... ~e7 7 w O-O O-O; for example, 8 b3 !1e8 9 .Bb2 .ifS (or 9 ... c6; in either case, Black would like to play ... e4 and possibly ... d5) and now: a) White can play h3 at several junctures, when Black has to consider whether ... ~h5 is worth it, allowing White to play g4 and after ... ~g6, lbh4 to win the bishop-pair at the cost of kingside weaknesses. After 10 h3 in this po- sition, most players will prefer 1O ... ~xf3 11 .Bxf3 and now 11...c6 or 11...e4 12 ~e2 c6, with well-placed pieces and the prospects of territorial gain to offset his opponent's bishops. b) 10 "iVc2 c6 11 dxe5 dxe5 12 l:i.adl 'fic7 with equal prospects, Pfleger-Lobron, Bundes- liga 1993/4. 5 ... ~xf3 6 exf3 exd4?! Here Black has a variety of moves such as 6 ... lbgf6, 6 ... lbe7 and 6 ... g6; in general, White should have a very modest edge, but with plenty of ideas for both sides. Although the text-move has been played in many games, Black gives up the centre and comes up short of space. 7 'ii'xd4lbgf6 8 ~g2 ~e7 9 O-O O-O Now White undoubtedly has some advan- tage with 10 f4 or 10 b3l:i.e8 11 ~b2, because his bishop-pair outweighs other factors. Be- cause of this, Black might want to look into his 6th-move alternatives. Earlier, I would recom- mend the plan with 2 ... g6 as a good way to ob- tain a solid position with a clear-cut strategy. Black Plays 1. .. 4:Jc6 The fact that l...lbc6 is playable is perhaps sur- prising, in that the reversed move 1 lbc3 leads to so many delicate positions. This suggests that for Black to play 1. .. lbc6, he has to proceed
278 MASTERING THE CHESS OPENINGS
more conservatively than White usually does when he embarks upon 1 ttJc3. Let's see a game with notes which outline the possibilities. 1 e4 Campora - Wockenfuss Amsterdam 1985
1 d4 ttJc6!? is daring, and usually consid-
ered slightly inferior because of 2 dS. In view of that, Wisnewski, who champions 1...ttJc6 against other moves, prefers to play 1 ... dS and then ... ttJc6 next, regardless of White's second move. That is somewhat less than a 'universal' system, but it's in a similar spirit. Anyway, let's look at I d4 ttJc6: a) 2 e4 transposes to our main line I e4 ttJc6 2d4. b) 2 ttJf3 can be met by 2 ... dS, with a type of Chigorin Defence, and it can transpose to that defence upon 3 c4. Most books on that opening cover moves such as 3 i..f4 and 3 g3. Instead, 2 ... d6 3 e4 is mentioned below, via the move- order I e4 ttJc6 2 ttJf3 d6 3 d4. c) 2 dS ttJeS (D). w Black is playing a mirror-image Alekhine Defence. As in that opening, he hopes to lure White's pawns forward and then decimate his centre. Most of what follows depends more upon specifics than principles, but a general difference consists in Black's ability to play ... cS in many Alekhine lines, whereas in the variation before us, ... fS could only be played at some risk to Black's king and kingside. Having said that, Black has the resources to make a real game out of it: c1) 3 f4 is a reasonable move, and after 3 ... ttJg6, Black's knight is immobilized and lacks immediate prospects. Still, the move f4 is itself weakening, and White has to be careful about overextending his centre. After the natu- ral 4 e4, Black has 4 ... eS!, preparing ... i..cs, when White must avoid S fS?

'i!Vxe47 fxg6 'i!VxdS+ 8 'iitel 'i!Vxdl + 9 'iitxdl hxg6, as given in some sources, which may be only slightly in Black's favour) 7 'i!Vf3 (the knight on g6 can't be taken due to 7 ... ttJxe4+, but there's also no good way to defend the e- pawn; for example, 7 ttJc3 i..b4 or 7 i..d3 ttJxe4+ 8 i..xe4 'i!Vxe4 9 fxg6 'i!Vxg2+ 10 ttJe2 'i!VxdS+ and Black ends up with four pawns and a strong attack for the piece) 7 ... ttJxe4+ 8 'iite2 ttJf4+ (8 ... ttJf6 9 fxg6 hxg6, with an ongoing at- tack, is also promising) 9 i..xf4 'i!Vxf4 10 'i!Vxf4 exf4 11 'iitf3 ttJf6 and Black is clearly better; for example, 12 c4?! d6 13 'iitxf4? gS+! 14 fxg6 i..h6+ IS 'iitf3 fxg6 and ... O-O, which is simply awful for White. Instead, S dxe6! is best, when S. .. fxe6 6 h4!? might be better than it looks, with the initial point 6 ... ttJxh4? 7 'i!Vg4! ttJg6 8 Itxh7. Another line is 6 ... i..cS!? 7 hS ttJ6e7 8 h6 g6 9 ttJf3 dS 10 ttJc3, intending 1O ... ttJf6 11 ttJgS!. There is a lot to explore here. c2) 3 e4 (D) is White's most common and natural move:

databases, and that with a spectacularly weak 4th move by Black - maybe I'm missing some- thing) 4 dxe6! (this simple solution is a prob- lem for Black; if White continues in a type of reversed Alekhine Four Pawns Attack by 4 f4 lbg65 c4, then either 5 ... i.c5 or 5 ... lbf6 is sat- isfactory - the latter is a variation from the Knight's Tango, which goes 1 d4 lbf6 2 c4 lbc6, and is one of the most respectable irregu- lar openings) and now we have: c2l) 4 .. .fxe6 5 lbc3! waits for Black to com- mit: 5 ... b6!? (5 ... i.c5?? 6 iKh5+ picks up a piece; 5 ... a6 6 f4 lbf7 7 lbf3 b5 is worth a shot) 6 f4! (after 6 lbf3, 6 ... lbf7!? 7 i.f4 i.c5 8 i.e2 lbe7 doesn't look too bad; instead 6 ... lbxf3+ 7 'iVxf3 i.b7 was cleverly answered by 8 ~h5+! g6 9 iKe5 lbf6 10 i.b5!, threatening 'ii'xe6+, in Volkov-B.Savchenko, Moscow 2006; 6 i.f4 lbg6 7 i.g3 should also give White an edge) 6 ... lbf7 (6 ... lbg6) 7 lbf3, and Black's develop- ment is awkward; he might try 7 ... i.c5!? 8 lba4 i.e7 9 i.d3 i.b7 10 O-O a6 with the idea ... b5 and ... lbf6. c22) 4 ... dxe6 5 'iVxd8+ 'it>xd8 and now 6 f4!? lbg6 may slightly favour White, but is a bit loose; instead, 6 i.f4 seems to yield an edge: 6 ... lbg6 (6 ... i.d6!? 7 i.g3 'it>e7 may be better) 7 i.e3 lbf6 8 lbc3?! (8 f3! with a modest cen- tral advantage) 8 ... lbg4, and Black equalizes after 9 .i:td 1+ i.d7 10 i.c 1 i.c5 11 lbh3 'it>e 7 12 i.e2 lbf6. w Let's return to the game:
1. .. lbc6 (D)
This is the long-debated Nimzowitsch De- fence, one of the best of the irregular openings versus 1 e4. Black will usually attack the centre by ... d5 or ... e5, but he hasn't committed yet. Again, over the years, several books and many theoretical articles have been produced about
1...lbc6, mainly by the move's advocates, but it
still isn't used at the elite level. I'll outline se- lected variations, trying to concentrate upon critical lines. 2d4 2 lbf3 is the main alternative, and a popular way to side-step Black's speciality lines. Then Black can switch to a main-line double e-pawn opening by 2 ... e5, or enter a somewhat shaky form of the Scandinavian Defence by 2 ... d5 3 exd5 ~xd5 (the development of the knight to c6 is usually deferred or skipped altogether). Another reasonable line that has been played by numerous grandmasters is 2 ... d6 3 d4 lbf6 4 lbc3 i.g4, with the main line going 5 i.e3 e6 6 h3 .Bh5; it is theoretically somewhat in White's favour. Even the absurd-looking con- tinuation 2 ... f5!? has had serious analysis de- voted to it. But the most intriguing independent reply to 2 lbf3 is 2 ... lbf6, when after 3 lbc3, 3 ... e5 is a Four Knights Game, interesting but not usually feared by Black. Or Black can enter less charted waters with 3 ... d5; for example, 4 e5 can be an- swered by 4 ... d4!? or by 4 ... lbd7 5 d4 lbb6, af- ter which Black's bishop will get to g4 or f5 with approximate equality. So the main line after 2 lbf3 lbf6 is 3 e5! lbg4 (3 ... lbd5 will transpose to a line of the Alekhine Defence that is considered a little risky, but is nevertheless quite respectable; note that Black's move-order has avoided the Four Pawns Attack of that opening) 4 d4 d6 5 h3 lbh6 (D). w
280 MASTERING THE CHESS OPENINGS
Black has a pretty ugly position that neverthe- less has some merits. His decentralized knight is an undoubted disadvantage, but he has prospects of chipping away at White's centre, after which that piece might be reintroduced by ... tLlf5. Of course, White can hardly complain about his prospects, but he shouldn't expect too much from the capture .i.xh6, which gives up the bishop-pair. 5 ... tLlh6 introduces a wide range of eccentric possibilities that are typical of irregu- lar openings; for example: a) 6 e6!? fxe6 7 .i.xh6 gxh6 8 tLlh4?! (8 .i.c4 .i.g7 9 0-00-0 is comfortably equal; Wisnewski gives the cute line 10 ':'el ~h8 11 .i.xe6? .i.xe6 12 ':'xe6 ':'xf3 13 gxf3 .i.xd4!, threatening both ... 'ikg8+ and ... .i.xb2) 8 ... 'ikd7! 9 'ikh5+ ~d8 10 c3 'ike8 11 .i.e2 and now 1l....i.g7 was fine in Trias-JRamirez, Catania 1990, but 11.. :~xh5 12 .i.xh5 e5 would definitely favour Black. b) 6 exd6 iVxd6 7 tLlc3 a6 looks strangely similar to a Scandinavian Defence with 3 ... 'ikd6. c) 6.i.b5 a6 7 .i.xc6+ bxc6 8 O-O g6 is 0 K. d) 6 tLlc3 (D).
B
Now 6 ... a6!? intends 7 exd61lVxd6 8 d5 tLle5. This favours White somewhat, but seems better than Narciso Dublan's 6 ... dxe5?! 7 d5 tLld4 8 tLlxe5 tLlhf5, when many moves have been tried and analysed, but not the simple 9 .i.e3!. e) 6 .i.xh6 gxh6 7 .i.b5 a6 8 .i.xc6+ bxc6 9 'ike2 l:tg8!, Sprenger-Keilhack, COIT. 1996. Now if 10 g3 llb8 11 b3, Wisnewski recommends ll...iVd7 12 tLlc3 c5, although 13 O-O-O or 13 d5 looks better than his 13 dxc5 dxe5 14.l::!.dl ~c6. In general, White seems to keep the advan- tage in the lines after 5 ... tLlh6, but Black's posi- tion is within playable boundaries. 2•.• d5 2 ... e5 3 d5 (3 dxe5 tLlxe5 is another story; without going into the details, it seems that 4 tLlf3, 4 tLlc3 and 4 .i.f4 all achieve a modest ad- vantage, which is perhaps enough to discourage Black from 2 ... e5; on the other hand, my data- base shows over 1000 games after 3 ... tLlxe5, so not everyone feels this way) 3 ... tLlce7 (D). w This is the reverse of 1 tLlc3 d5 2 e4 d4 3 tLlce2 e5, as discussed earlier. As in that line, Black's goal is to play ... tLlf6, ... tLlg6, and bring his bishop to c5 or b4. Now White has many possible moves, of which I'll note just a few: a) In keeping with the reversed variation, 4 f3 has the idea 4 ... tLlg6 5 .i.e3 ! (compare 1 tLlc3 d5 2 e4 d4 3 tLlce2 e5 4 tLlg3 .i.e6!). But since White's queen is cut off from h5, Black might try 4 .. .f5!?, to which White could reply 5 .i.g5!? h6 6 .i.e3 or 5 tLlc3 tLlf6 6 .i.g5. For any plan in which Black plays ... g6 and ... .i.g7, White can claim the normal advantage that he gets in the Samisch Variation of the King's Indian follow- ing c4, tLlc3, .i.e3, f3, 'ilVd2 and O-O-O, because Black's knight really doesn't belong on e7 in that case. Also, h4-h5 might gain in force. b) With the above in mind, it seems to me that 4 .i.d3 also deserves a closer look, with the same ideas. c) Another interesting idea is 4 h4, with the idea of advancing the h-pawn in the case of ei- ther ... tLlg6 or ... g6. d) The usual version of the h-pawn advance has gone 4 tLlf3 tLlg6 5 h4, when A.lvanov- Benjamin, USA Ch, Parsippany 1996 contin- ued 5 ... h5 6 .i.g5 tLlf6 7 tLlc3!?

(8 'iVd2 O-O 9 O-O-O is better) 8 ... ..Bb4+! 9 c3 ..Be7 10 ..Bxf6 ..Bxf6 with ap- proximate equality, or perhaps a very slight edge to White because of his superiority in space after 11 g3. 3 tL'lc3 White attacks the centre directly, but this isn't his only move: a) 3 eS (D) bears some resemblance to the French and Caro-Kann Advance Variations.
B
It's true that Black's knight on c6 prevents him from attacking the d4-pawn by ... cS, but in modem openings Black attacks the front on the pawn-chain (in this case, eS) as often as the 'base' (d4); after the move ... f6, that attack is assisted by his knight on c6. In terms of devel- opment, Black gets the best of both openings: in contrast to the French Defence, he can get his queen's bishop out to fS or g4, and in contrast to the Caro-Kann Defence, he can put his queen's knight on c6! White's main advantage is his firm command of territory and the cramping in- fluence of his eS-pawn. For example, in both the French and Caro-Kann, he finds it difficult to shore up his pawn-chain with f4; here it's easy. Unfortunately, he creates some light-square weaknesses by so doing. Let's see how this plays out; Black has two main moves: al) 3 ... ..ifS isn't approved by most theoreti- cians, but it is sufficient to establish a meaning- ful stake in the position. all) An entertaining example went 4 tL'le2 e6 S tL'lg3 ..Bg6 6 h4 hS (6 .. .f6 7 hS ..Bf7 8 f4 'iVd7 is probably a better approach) 7 tL'le2!? (a little outrageous; White neglects his develop- ment, but threatens tL'lf4) 7 ... ..ifS!? (the third bishop move) 8 tL'lf4 (and the fourth by this knight!) 8 ... g6 9 c3 'iVd7 10 tL'ld2 (10 b4!) 1O .. .f6! 11 exf6 eS!? 12 dxeS tL'lxeS, Roman- ishin-Mariotti, Leningrad 1977, and here 13 tL'lf3 is dynamically balanced. a12) Instead, 4 tL'lf3 can be met by 4 ... 'iVd7, 4 ... f6 or 4 ... e6. In the last case, S ..Be2 tL'lb4!? 6 tL'la3 cS 7 c3 tL'lc6 8 O-O with the idea tL'lc2-e3 is a possible continuation; compare the Short Variation of the Caro-Kann Defence. a13) White's most important move may well be the ultra-flexible 4 c3. The play can go in a great many directions at this point. 4 ... f6 S f4 tL'lh6 resembles 'a2' and 4 .. .'t,wd7 is often played with the idea of an early ... O-O-O. The obvious 4 ... e6 defines the light-squared pawn-chain with Black's bishop outside it. After S f4, Black should consider restraining White's kingside first with ... tL'lh6 or ... hS and ... tL'lh6 before un- dertaking action elsewhere. Compare line 'a2'. a2) 3 ... f6 has several possible replies. Per- haps the most significant is 4 f4 (4 ..Bd3 can be met by 4 ... tL'lxd4!? or4. .. g6; 4 ..ibS ..Bd7 has the idea S. .. tL'lxeS, familiar from the French De- fence, so S tL'lc3 fxeS 6 dxeS e6 7 tL'lf3 ..Bb4 might follow, with perhaps a slight edge for White after 8 ..Bxc6) 4 ... tL'lh6 (trying to take over light squares; fS, g4 and e4 are all poten- tially vulnerable; simply 4 ... ..ifS S tL'le2 'it'd7 6 tL'lg3 tL'lh6 is also playable) S tL'lf3 ..ifS (or S. .. ..Bg4, which White could have avoided by S c3 first; with the text-move, Black has in mind some combination of the moves ... e6, ... ..Be4, ... tL'lfS and ... fxeS) 6 c3 e6 (D). w

fence, was famously employed by Tony Miles to beat Karpov in Skara 1980. Were it not for the fact that Black has kept his disadvantage down to manageable proportions in practice (as indicated by White's lead of only 100 points or so in performance rating), I'd call1...a6 outright 'bad'. It is at least substandard, and very risky, as indicated by this game fragment and notes:

4 .•• ltJf6?! An important juncture. Although it has been played in many games, this move-order has grave drawbacks. 4 ... e6 would transpose after S Vie2, but White is more likely to play S O-O or, still better, S a4!, which leaves Black with noth- ing but undesirable options. S ... M may be best, but then 6 c4! is strong, among others. I think that this simple and neglected point puts 1. .. a6, already marginal, into serious doubt. S'iYe2 There are two good alternatives to commit- ting the queen: a) After S ltJbd2 e6 6 O-O, several games have continued 6 ... cS (everything else is de- pressing) 7 dxcS! i.xcS 8 eS ltJdS 9 ltJe4 (or 9 a4 first) 9 ... i.e7 10 a4 M, and 11 c4 bxc3 12 bxc3 with the idea i.a3 is good, while 11ltJfd2 with the idea ltJc4 yields a large advantage. But the most fun line is 11 i.gS f6 12 exf6ltJxf6 13 ltJeS!!, with the idea 13 ... O-O 14ltJxf6+ i.xf6 IS VihS g6 16 i.xg6 hxg6 17 'iYxg6+ 'it>h8, and after the remarkably slow 18 .:tadl!

(but the alternatives are miserable), and now 7 c4 bxc3 8 bxc3 is certainly difficult for Black, but 7 ltJgS! is much more fun: 7 ... g6? (the cutest line after 7 ... h6? is 8ltJxf7!

14 ... gxf6? 14 ... ltJxf6! is unclear. After 14 ... gxf6?, White played the inspired IS ltJeS?! and won, but that would only have drawn if Black had defended correctly. The right move was IS 'iVe4! fS 16 ~eS with domi- nation of the dark squares. lltJf3 b5 has a decent reputation (the related I d4 bS gives White extra options; for example,
2 e4 i.b7 3 i.d3 or 3 f3), although 2 e4 i.b7
(2 ... a6 3 d4 i.b7 4 i.d3 takes us back to the St George) 3 i.xbS! i.xe4 4 O-O is a full tempo down for Black compared to the Sokolsky/Pol- ish main line 1 b4 eS 2 i.b2 i.xb4 3 i.xeS ltJf6. Even the reversed 1 b4 eS version is difficult for White to negotiate, and adding a tempo here makes Black's task much harder. 2 ... h6 is slow, and White can pick a comfort- able route to advantage via most common-sense moves; for example, 3 h4 (or 3 ltJc3 i.g7 4 h4 with the idea 4 ... cS S e3 or 4 ... g4 S e4, transpos- ing) 3 ... g4 4 e4 i.g7 SltJc3 d6 (S ... cS 6 i.e3!) 6 ltJge2 and now 6 ... ltJf6 7 i.e3 or 6 ... ltJc6 7 i.e3 eS 8 dSltJce7 9ltJg3!. A 'theoretical' line goes 3 e4 i.g7 4ltJc3 cS, and now SltJge2 is a good al- ternative to S dxcS i.xc3+ 6 bxc3 'iYaS 7 ltJe2 ltJf6 (7 .. :~xcS s 'iVd4!), when at least Black has something to play for. 3ltJc3 Or: a) 3 i.xgS cS (D) is Black's point, although if White gives the pawn back he should emerge with the advantage.
1...gS is a horrible choice versus 1 e4 (when 2 W
d4 is a tempo-up version of 1 g4) and even worse against 1 d4 (2 i.xgS !), but it makes some sense versus 1 c4, and 1 c4 g5 (D) has actually been played in over 400 games in my database. w The idea is that White can no longer defend his long al-h8 diagonal by c3, as he did with ... c6 versus I g4. Nevertheless, Black's kingside is weakened, and pawns can't move backwards. I'll settle for 'substandard' here, because the su- perior positions that White gets aren't devastat- ing ones. Here's an example: Mednis - Hodgson New York 1990

For example, 4ltJf3! (after 4 e3, rather than 4 ... 'iYb6 S ltJc3! 'iVxb2 6 'iYc1! 'iYxc1 + 7 I:i.xc1 cxd4 S ltJbS, Black should play 4 ... 'iVaS+!

I'm afraid that L.g5 is just too much to ask of Black. Hopefully it's been both enlightening and fun to examine these irregular openings and tackle the most difficult ones. Remember that they are an authentic part of opening theory, not merely an afterthought, and should be studied in order to round out your general knowledge of the game.
9 Choosing and Preparing Openings
Every student eventually comes up against the issue of how to select and prepare openings. As it turns out, the problem never completely goes away, not even for the strongest players in the world. Teachers and writers express various opinions about how to choose openings, but they disagree firmly with each other and haven't even begun to arrive at a consensus. Some fun- damental questions arise: whether to specialize in one opening, whether to pick extremely the- matic or open-ended openings, how to match openings with your style and predilections, and how much time to devote to opening study. On a concrete level, we have questions about how to organize and record a specific repertoire, how to learn it, how to get practice with your chosen openings, how to improve your play in a certain opening, and so forth. In my opinion, some of the most common answers to these questions fall short in that they don't distinguish students by their level of strength and experience. In reviewing the liter- ature, I find that most of the books are written from the standpoint of grandmaster needs and circumstances; for their examples they use the experiences of some titled player or other and explain how they prepared their openings or solved their opening problems. Of course, what the near-beginner needs out of his chess open- ings is quite a different matter from what the average club player requires, or the casual Internet Chess Club aficionado, or the profes- sional tournament player. In what follows, I'll try to draw upon my experience as a teacher to accommodate that factor. How Important is Opening Study? We hear it again and again: players spend too much time studying the openings. Variations upon this theme abound, and the issue takes on particular significance because of the limited number of hours the average person has for chess. In lieu of so much attention to openings, would our time be better spent on, e.g., middle- games, endgames or tactics? Naturally these are all interrelated areas and, in varying de- grees, essential for improvement. Still, I think you'll find that the much-maligned emphasis on opening study isn't such a bad thing after all. In fact, it's probably no coincidence that in the real world, most experienced players from lower master level all the way up to World Champion spend/ar more of their time studying openings than all the aforementioned options put to- gether! I don't think that we can write this off as a mass delusion among players (and their coaches), or as something that is fundamentally against their best interests. For one thing, open- ing study provides a disciplined entrance into the broader area of middlegame study. It's also interesting to see what other areas of the game our top players study away from the board. After years of being around masters and professional players, I would say that review- ing, studying and writing about their own games consumes the second largest amount of time af- ter opening preparation. As far as I know, every top-level teacher recommends self-critical anal- ysis of your games, and it should be given high priority for anyone seeking to improve. But even that process includes in-depth consider- ation of the openings in those games and the typical positions arising from them. Actually, my own teaching priorities in this respect are somewhat different where the average player is concerned. Apart from openings, I think that exercise with tactical problems is the other most valuable use of study time, especially right be- fore a tournament. Incidentally, tactics can be usefully connected with openings that typically generate them, and I try to construct exercises that do that. What about other areas of the game? Let's look at some of the alternatives to investigating
290 MASTERING THE CHESS OPENINGS
openings. One is to study the middlegame. But in modern chess, as has been pointed out by many writers, the middlegame is very often subsumed within the opening. That is, when players study the opening, they are in part studying what we used to call the middlegame, and in some cases beyond that. The most useful kind of middlegame know ledge, and the easiest to retain, has to do with frequently-arising, the- matic structures. It's difficult enough to know where your pieces should go and what their fu- ture might be, the more so when you haven't seen the structure before, or something similar. This knowledge can be picked up by investiga- tion of particular openings, and enhanced by playing over exemplary games (preferably an- notated), comparing different interpretations and absorbing specific theory. Important tacti- cal devices and attacking schemes will recur, very often also applying to tactics that arise in unrelated situations. Naturally, the study of a finite set of openings can't cover the broad di- versity of possible middlegames, and it's help- ful to read books which talk about strategies in the abstract. However, middlegame theory that is too general tends to be of little use in over- the-board situations. Apart from openings and middlegames, the student is commonly advised to study the end- game, sometimes with an admonition to stay away from serious opening preparation until an unspecified 'later'. When I was beginning to play chess four decades ago, this advice was ubiquitous, accompanied by the 'fact' that all the Soviet children learned endings in depth be- fore they were allowed to play any games. That turned out to be an utter myth, but there's no doubt that learning a limited set of basic end- ings is absolutely essential for your develop- ment as a player. What's less certain is how many endings this involves, at what stage you need to learn them, and how many of them you will absorb by experience, just as you do with openings. Students to whom I assign endgame study constantly point out that they seldom get as far as the ending, at least not to one that doesn't already have a clear result; and when they do, it is usually decided by tactical means. Part of this has to do with the level of play, but grandmasters say the same thing, attributing it to the complex and often sharp openings played at their level. For the majority of us, the dearth of challenging endings may also come from the short time-controls that are now customary. Taken as a whole, I think that there's much wis- dom in most players' intuitive feeling that openings and middlegames can take priority without damaging their long-term prospects. Fortunately, the majority of ending types, apart from a set of standard and recurring elementary ones that everyone should know (and periodi- cally refresh their knowledge of), are those that you will commonly get from the openings you play. In most mainstream openings, there are characteristic endgames that arise repeatedly from the structure of that opening. If you think about your own favourite openings, you'll prob- ably recognize connections to representative endings. In fact, speciality books upon particu- lar openings will very often include an explicit discussion of the typically-occurring endings. So a serious study of complete games in your opening will go a long way towards improving your practical endgame results, as well as de- veloping your ability to think about endgames in general, which is the most important skill in the long run. Let's face it: it would be ideal to have time to study middlegames, endings and openings, along with the great games of masters; and it's also hard to argue with doing tactical exercises and problems, annotating your own games, and playing as much as possible. To the extent that you can do so, explore all of these options. In the context of this book, however, I would ar- gue that the tremendous amount of time spent upon the openings by leading players young and old reflects the importance of such study. While other types of knowledge are necessary if you are to become a complete player, opening study is the single most practical and efficient means of improving your mastery of the game as a whole. Openings Selection Before moving on to suggest methods of study and preparation, I'll make a stab at the most dif- ficult question to answer with any kind of spec- ificity: what openings should I play? Once a player decides upon an actual set of openings to
CHOOSING AND PREPARING OPENINGS 291
play, however provisionally, the subsequent sections about how to study and prepare them will take on a concrete significance. Of course, there are myriad openings with countless varia- tions, and any suggestions that I make will be fundamentally arbitrary. Nevertheless, I'd like to give some concrete examples so as to make a general point: your choice of openings should be based upon your level of playing strength. With that in mind, I'll separate advice into broad sections, distinguishing choices and ob- jectives that apply to players of various strengths who wish to improve their opening preparation. Within each general section, I shall break down the material on the basis of playing level. Of course, given sufficient knowledge, a player can succeed with any conventional chess opening. Nevertheless, you can improve your play more quickly and less painfully by tailoring your openings to the development of needed skills. With that in mind, I'll talk on a broader level for the less experienced player, whereas for more advanced players, discuss mainly the prac- tical implications of opening choices. In gen- eral, I suggest learning a wide variety of posi- tion-types in order to become a stronger player. Assessing your own level and degree of so- phistication in handling opening situations is difficult. Rather than get too picky, I've divided players into four very broadly defined skill cat- egories, from the lowest, D, through to the highest, A (these are chosen to minimize confu- sion with the many other standard divisions of chess strength by letter). Naturally, these are approximations and my advice will significantly overlap between them, so your precise category isn't crucial: Category D: beginners, near-beginners and relatively inexperienced players (e.g., the latter might have three years or fewer of playing reg- ularly, and not necessarily devotedly). Category C: players with a moderate level of experience and some opening competence. This broad group might include club players, inter- mittent tournament players and consistent on- line players. People in this category probably lack sufficient free time for intensive study and play, or they may be stuck in a rut, have bad habits, etc. Category B: players of considerable strength (say, 1700 Elo and above) who already have a fairly stable repertoire and have looked into at least some of their openings in depth. But the general level of their openings is clearly below someone rated a few hundred points above them, and that is demonstrated by the inferior posi- tions they often fall into. Category A: Players above 2000 Elo up to about 2300 Elo with the typical problems that arise in finding openings that combine the am- bition for opening advantage with some degree of safety. I won't presume to give professionals, who exceed this level, advice about their open- ing choices, so this section applies to advanced amateurs who are, for example, regular tourna- ment players, rapidly-improving juniors, and/or devoted online activists. The advice and potential repertoire choices that I'll suggest next are necessarily broad, if only because they don't take into account the distinctive traits of individuals. For fine tuning, or to decide which pieces of advice given below apply, you may want to consult a chess teacher. Alternatively, a disciplined, self-aware student can make those decisions based upon an analy- sis of his own games and some study. I'd be a little careful about plunging into complicated opening variations that just happen to present themselves to you because of, for example, a recent grandmaster game or a friend's enthusi- asm. Study of any sort can only help one im- prove, of course, but this might not be the most efficient use of your time. Regardless of your category, the most basic goals will be obvious: to survive the opening without serious disadvantage; and to gain an advantage sufficient to discomfit your oppo- nent. Beyond that, always pay attention to the typical middlegames and endgames that your opening produces. Finally, remember that I am only indicating some personal thoughts on how to make prog- ress with openings. You should follow your in- stincts, especially if you find a method that works for and motivates you.
1. Choose openings corresponding to your
skill level and available study time This is fairly obvious, but some teachers will entice you into playing their own, sometimes too sophisticated, openings. It's important to
292 MASTERING THE CHESS OPENINGS
stick within your capabilities, and at the same time master traditional concepts before taking on exotic piece and pawn deployments. Let me explain this by means of specific examples. I won't build a complete repertoire for you, of course, but I'll try to indicate what would be in- volved in doing so. Category D Openings For players with very limited experience, I rec- ommend using openings in which the play can be clarified at an early stage, often with a de- gree of simplification. To accomplish this safely will take a little study, because you will have to get used to playing with open lines for both sides' pieces, but you can't eliminate risk en- tirely in the opening anyway. If that approach doesn't appeal to you, you should at least try to occupy the centre and bring your pieces out quickly, aiming them at central squares if possi- ble. I think that it's best to avoid manoeuvring games in which most of the pieces remain on the board for a long time and don't come into contact with each other. At this level, you should be studying tactics independently, and it's good practice to play openings of at least a partially tactical nature. There's nothing new about this advice. For example, teachers all over the world suggest that inexperienced players begin with 1 e4. Ad- vancing your e-pawn may be unoriginal, but it allows you to control the direction of the game to a greater degree than other first moves. You will undoubtedly see the reply 1 ... e5 most often when playing at or near a beginner's level, when I recommend using some system with an early d4 to at least partially clear out the centre and give your pieces room. In that context, the most common move 2 lbf3 is a good one. For example, if Black plays 2 ... d6, you can get practice playing with extra space by 3 d4. Black may not often answer 2 lbf3 with 2 ... lbf6 (the Petroff) at this level, but again, 3 d4 is a straight- forward answer for the inexperienced player, intending 3 ... exd4 4 e5 (and if Black plays 4 ... lbe4 or 4 ... lbd5, 5 "iYxd4) or 3 ... lbxe4 4 iLd3, to get developed quickly. Another choice is 2 lbf3 lbf6 3 lbc3, and if 3 ... lbc6 (the Four Knights Game), 4 iLb5 or 4 d4. One advantage of this latter choice is that you can also play 2 lbf3 lbc6 3 lbc3, when 3 ... lbf6 will transpose. The Four Knights is a sensible opening choice as you start out. After 2 lbf3, 2 ... lbc6 will occur in the bulk of your games. Then the Scotch Game, 3 d4 (in- tending 3 ... exd4 4 lbxd4) is a possible first opening, but I recommend taking up the classi- cal and instructive move 3 iLc4 at an early stage. Then, against 3 ... iLc5, it's thematic to try to establish the ideal centre by 4 c3 and 5 d4; af- ter that, things can get complicated enough that you need to take a look at some theory and learn the basics; for example, you could use Chapter 5 of Volume 1 (or any standard source). Versus
3. .. lbf6, you might pick 4 d3 as a solid begin-
ning point, and be sure to get castled and bring your pieces out quickly. Both 4 d4 and 4 lbg5 are more adventurous, but they absolutely re- quire serious hours of study, as you will see by glancing at Volume 1, Chapter 6. The Sicilian Defence, 1 e4 c5, is the most popular grandmaster opening, but when lower players use it, they usually do so with some memorized systems in mind. I recommend play- ing simple, principled moves against it; for ex- ample, 2 c3 makes sense, intending to capture the centre with 3 d4, which is what you should do versus most slow moves anyway. A typical line is 2 ... lbf6 3 e5 lbd5 4 d4, when after 4 ... cxd4, 5 "iYxd4 is a handy first system with open lines and quick development. You can fol- low with lbf3, iLd3/c4 and O-O, moving your queen to e4 if attacked by ... lbc6. If Black plays 2 ... d5 in response to 2 c3, then 3 exd5 ~xd5 4 d4 will also open up lines; generally lbf3, .te2 and O-O follow, with iLe3 if necessary. A slightly more advanced possibility against the Sicilian Defence would be to clear out the centre with the Morra Gambit: 2 d4 cxd4 3 c3 dxc3 4 lbxc3, as described in Chapter 5 of this volume; begin- ners should delay taking this up, however, as it's important to learn the value of material be- fore experimenting with openings that sacrifice it for other gains. Against the French Defence and Caro-Kann Defence, the easiest way to stick to the open- lines policy is to avoid e5 and develop quickly. In the French, for example, a possibility is 1 e4 e6 2 d4 d5 3 exd5 exd5 4 iLd3, followed by lbf3 (or lbe2) and O-O. Or you can do something similar starting with 3 lbc3, playing 3 ... iLb4 4
CHOOSING AND PREPARING OPENINGS 293
exd5 or 3 ... ttJf6 4 exd5 (in the latter case, expe- rienced players may wince at allowing theoreti- cal equality so early on, but at a lower level such moves can be recommended as both sound and instructive). Versus the Caro-Kann, the exchanging pol- icy of 1 e4 c6 2 d4 d5 3 exd5 cxd5 4 iLd3, again intending ttJf3 and O-O, is a good starting point, with the same philosophy that we applied to the French Defence. You won't see the Alekhine Defence, 1 e4 ttJf6, very often. But if you do, you might want to play 2 e5 ttJd5 3 d4 d6 4 ttJf3, usually followed by iLe2 and O-O. Most other moves, such as 1...g6, 1...d6 or 1...b6, can nor- mally be met by 2 d4, 3 ttJc3 and 4 ttJf3, fol- lowed by a move by the fl-bishop and O-O. Of course, you can also play 1 d4, the other central move, but then you probably want to keep the position fairly quiet, because it takes a longer time to castle to safety than it does with 1 e4. A solid and more-or-less universal set-up is 2 ttJf3 and 3 iLf4, followed in most cases by 4 e3, 5 iLe2 and 6 O-O. I'd rather see my students fight their way through open positions instead; however, if you're not getting out of the open- ing alive after 1 e4, this method of playing 1 d4 deserves consideration. A word of advice: notice that a commonly suggested 'easy' repertoire for White with 1 ttJf3 and the King's Indian Attack (that is 2 g3, 3 iLg2, 4 O-O and 5 d3, with ttJbd2 and e4 to fol- low) doesn't lead to an open game, or one with a clear plan for White. Furthermore, it encour- ages mechanical play. Similarly, teachers some- times recommend the Colle System (with I d4, 2 ttJf3, 3 e3 and usually iLd3, O-O, c3 and ttJbd2), which can also be played too automati- cally, and usually doesn't lead to an open posi- tion. For true beginners, the King's Indian Attack and Colle System have the benefit of of- fering a safe position that nearly guarantees passage to some kind of playable middlegame; they may be a reasonable alternative if other openings are too intimidating. But having gained even a small amount of experience, you really should switch to more open and less au- tomatic play. As Black, I think that a Category D player would do well to proceed classically. That means playing 1. .. e5 versus I e4 and 1. .. d5 ver- sus 1 d4. In this, again, I am repeating the advice of teachers since time immemorial. The idea is similar to that behind White's 1 e4: you are guaranteed a strong presence in the centre and relatively quick development. When start- ing out, it's useful to play positions in which you control space. After I e4, 1...e5 serves that purpose. By contrast, the Sicilian Defence (1 e4 c5) normally leaves you with little room to ma- noeuvre and is best left until your positional skills develop. If you don't take to 1...e5, you can also consider answering I e4 with the Caro-Kann Defence (1 e4 c6 2 d4 d5) or the French Defence (1 e4 e6 2 d4 d5), both of which put the d-pawn on the 4th rank and stake a claim on the centre. They have the advantage of being slightly less expected at this level, but they have the drawback of allowing your oppo- nent to create fairly closed positions if they choose to play e5. Versus 1 d4, 1...d5 achieves similar results in terms of central control. It's true that 1... ttJf6 also stops 2 e4 and introduces a number of established defences. The latter tend to require some sophistication, however, and it's easy for the inexperienced player to end up facing a large and dangerous white centre. In more specific terms, let's assume that you've decided upon 1 e4 e5. It will involve a fair amount of preparation even on a low level. In chess, playing Black tends to require more study, since you are at more risk of serious dis- advantage when moving second. I'm not going to go into detail, but you'll need answers to var- ious less common but perfectly legitimate open- ings such as 2 f4 (the King's Gambit), 2 d4 exd4
3 c3 (the Danish Gambit), as well as 2 ttJc3 (the
Vienna Game) and 2 ttJf3 ttJc6 3 ttJc3 ttJf6 (the Four Knights Game). This is easier than it sounds, because there are fairly simple ways to proceed against them. In Volume I of this se- ries, for example, I examined some fairly easy responses to the King's Gambit, and in this vol- ume you'll find suggestions against the Danish Gambit and Four Knights Game. If you don't see something that appeals to you or I haven't mentioned something, you can look for master games in a database or use an opening ency- clopaedia. Just be aware that all of these moves are perfectly playable for White and you can't force your way to an advantage against them. Assuming that you narrow your difficulties down to 2 ttJf3, one option is to conserve your
294 MASTERING THE CHESS OPENINGS
study time, and play something relatively sim- ple like the Philidor Defence (2 ... d6). It's a le- gitimate choice, but gives you a cramped game, so as early as possible you should take the plunge with 2 ... lbc6. Doing so requires more work, but it will teach you more. By now you may be familiar with 3 i.c4, and you'll have a good idea what to do about it. Again, refer to Volume 1 of this series and/or outside sources. White's most respected line is 3 i.b5 (the Ruy Lopez), when it's a lot easier to avoid the com- plications of 3 ... a6 and play 3 ... lbf6. Then after
4 O-O, you can opt for a move with familiar
themes like 4 ... i..c5. You won't be seeing 1 d4 too often from in- experienced players. As mentioned, 1...d5 gives you a flrm central presence, and you can bring your pieces out relatively quickly to establish some central control. If White plays the most important move, 2 c4, inexperienced players might want to begin classically with 2 ... e6 fol- lowed by ... lbf6 and ... i.e7 (see Volume 2, Chapter 2). Slower moves such as 2lbf3 or 2 e3 are less challenging. It's logical and safe to start out with 2 ... lbf6 and 3 ... e6 (although if you can play ... i.f5 before ... e6, it makes your develop- ment even easier). Then you can set up a forma- tion with ... c5, ... lbc6, ... i.e7 and ... O-O. If you feel confldent about your handling of open po- sitions, you can play ... c5 on your 3rd or 4th move and create some open lines. Finally, it's important to use the 'What if?' procedure that I recommend below. That is, as you study openings, ask yourself why moves other than the ones listed aren't played. In do- ing so, watch for basic captures and tactics. At this level, it doesn't help you to win games if you memorize certain moves and then drop a pawn or piece the minute the opponent plays something different. On the other hand, that will inevitably happen - it has happened to all of us - so don't become discouraged. You'll be surprised how studying chess in any form will improve your visualization and reduce errors. Category C Openings At this level, the beneflts derived from playing with space and open lines still take priority, but it's also a good point to begin including varia- tions which can yield other types of positions. For most players, 1 e4 will probably still be the most attractive move, especially if you have al- ready played it while at a Category D level. On the other hand, there are practical beneflts to taking up 1 d4 - namely, your opponents will have seen it less and you will expand your bank of familiar positions. The English Opening with
1 c4 is a different matter. It tends to put oppo-
nents of equal strength on their own, which is good, but requires sophisticated positional han- dling, and unless you are conversant with spe- cifics, it may not yield enough open positions to provide the valuable training such positions offer. Similar considerations apply to 1 lbf3. Nevertheless, these openings are acceptable as long as you determinedly look for active play with parts of your repertoire. There's always time to emphasize slow positional systems as you improve. You can play solidly at this level, of course, but you might also begin to incorporate the ideas of setting initiative off against material. As White, along with some main lines. you might want to incorporate a gambit line, or even two. As a 1 e4 player facing 1. .. e5 (which is still the most likely response at this level), 2 d4 exd4
3 c3 dxc3 4 lbxc3 is a type of Danish Gambit
that will often transpose via 4 ... lbc6 5 lbf3 to the Goring Gambit. One advantage of playing this way (with the 2 d4 move-order) is that you bypass Black's second-move alternatives that follow 2lbf3 (such as 2 ... lbf6 and 2 ... d6). This is described in Chapter 5. The Goring Gambit is a good practical attacking system, in that Black's position can easily come under flre, while White retains a lead in development in any case. If nothing else, you can have it as a surprise weapon to supplement something less adventurous. Understandably, giving up material may not appeal to everyone, and you should try to bal- ance that activist tendency with learning classic variations as well. Unless you have a lot of study time and motivation, it's best to do so without being laden with too many double- edged and/or heavily analysed positions. After
1 e4 e5 2 lbf3 lbc6, 3 i.c4 is a conventional
choice - you can utilize and expand upon the knowledge that you gained if you played this move as a Category D player. Or you might pre- fer to play 3 i.b5 (the Ruy Lopez), but stick to
CHOOSING AND PREPARING OPENINGS 295
lines which steer clear of the heaviest theory; for example, 3 ... a6 4 i.xc6 (the Exchange Vari- ation), or 3 ... ttJf6 4 'ife2. Versus the Sicilian Defence, which you will be seeing increasingly often, you might also consider playing a gambit. Specifically, 1 e4 cS
2 d4 cxd4 3 c3 (the Morra Gambit) offers a
pawn for initiative. Following 3 ... dxc3 4 ttJxc3, White's most common attacking set-up is ttJf3, i.c4, O-O and 'ife2, with the idea of bringing a bishop to e3, f4 or gS, and a rook to the open d- file. This sort of thing can be fun, and has no simple solution that negates your chances. See Chapter S on gambits. Assuming that you don't want to playa gam- bit (or want to have options), you could explore your first fianchetto system with 2 ttJc3, 3 g3 and 4 i.g2 (the Closed Sicilian). Alternatively, you can construct a repertoire around 2 ttJf3, picking and choosing which main lines, if any, are worth embarking upon. Some strong grand- masters, for example, have made a lifelong liv- ing off moves such as 1 e4 cS 2 ttJf3 d6 3 i.bS+ and 2 ttJf3 ttJc6 3 i.bS, which are relatively safe systems. For the most part, however, 1 e4 players eventually seem to settle upon the lines involving 2 ttJf3 and 3 d4 (the Open Sicilian). If that's your inclination, you still needn't commit yourself to heavy theoretical study. For exam- ple, versus the move 2 ... d6 (most common at this level, because your opponents will want to get to the Dragon Variation or the NajdorfVari- ation), 3 d4 cxd4 4 'ifxd4 is a perfectly respect- able line (the idea is 4 ... ttJc6 S i.bS, when White maintains a lead in development). Or, af- ter 3 d4 cxd4 4 ttJxd4 ttJf6 S ttJc3, you can play slightly less critical variations. For instance, versus S ... a6, the ever-popular Najdorf Varia- tion, you can begin by playing classically with 6 i.e2 and O-O, when understanding will be more important than memorization; see Vol- ume 1. There are also a number of sound but slightly offbeat lines such as 6 h3, 6 g3 and 6 'iff3. The same classical approach can be em- ployed against the Dragon Sicilian: S ... g6 6 i.e2. Then, slowly but surely, you can build a repertoire which includes more critical, tacti- cally-oriented variations. At this stage, you will begin to see openings such as the French Defence and Caro-Kann De- fence more often. It's still reasonable to play the Exchange Variations mentioned above, but at some point you'll probably want to try to cre- ate more problems for your opponent. With some study, 1 e4 e6 2 d4 dS 3 eS can be a nice weapon, and has the additional benefit of intro- ducing you to the theory of pawn-chains. Ver- sus the Caro-Kann, you can begin to build a classical repertoire with 3 ttJc3 (or 3 tiJd2) 3 ... dxe4 4 ttJxe4, but it's even easier to learn some basic lines after 3 eS; for example, 3 ... i.fS 4 ttJf3 followed by i.e2 and O-O, with the pawn- chain move c3 in most cases. As Black, 1. .. eS is still a good answer to 1 e4, of course, but this time you should seriously consider other defences such as 1...c6 and 1.. .e6, which allow for both open and closed positions. They also involve some recurring structures which will serve the student throughout his playing days. I'm still not excited about my students playing the Sicilian Defence at this stage, because it almost always means playing with less space and development, and in some cases with exotic and not particularly instruc- tive pawn-structures. The Pirc (1...d6), Modem (l...g6) and Alekhine (l...ttJf6) Defences are perfectly logical and sound openings, but I think they have practical drawbacks for the player be- low 1600, in that they concede space and don't generally yield as free piece-play. But if you have a strong affinity for any of them, that could outweigh other factors. Personal enjoy- ment should definitely be a consideration when you're deciding what to play. Versus 1 d4, you can always stick with
1...dS, as above. If you haven't already commit-
ted to too many gambit lines, the Albin Coun- ter-Gambit, 1 d4 dS 2 c4 eS (with the idea of 3 dxeS d4) has a decent reputation, and is a good alternative to the more conservative play with 2 ... e6 above. Another respectable gambit is the Budapest, which goes 1 d4 ttJf6 2 c4 eS 3 dxeS ttJg4 (or the more speculative 3 ... ttJe4); you'll usually recover the pawn on eS. For those who follow grandmaster fashion, I should add that the currently popular Slav Defence, 1 d4 dS 2 c4 c6, is sound and effective. However, it can lead to rather slow development, and my feel- ing is that it's better suited at the higher levels. Finally, you can try a quick-developing 1...ttJf6 system; for example, the Nimzo-Indian, which goes 1 d4 ttJf6 2 c4 e6 3 ttJc3 i.b4 often
296 MASTERING THE CHESS OPENINGS
followed by ... O-O, gets your pieces out rapidly, and the Bogo-Indian, 3 lDf3 i.b4+, does the same. Category B Openings At this point you should be ready to tackle posi- tions of most types, so the number of appropri- ate opening choices increases dramatically. Still, players with limited time for competition and study have to consider the practical drawbacks of using too many variations which entail a large initial time investment, and then require continual updating of theory to avoid unpleas- ant surprises. It's valuable to playa couple of theoretical 'main lines', even if you need to use your understanding and instincts as well as your memory to tackle them; you might even essay upon one highly tactical variation that is at the height of fashion. However, you will want to mix any such complex lines with systems that require less study and offer reasonably clear strategies versus normal play. The latter will often be positional or slightly slower open- ings, but can also include attacking and gambit lines, particularly if the main attacking meth- ods are thematic, and a new discovery by your opponent won't be of fatal consequence. This is also a good point to include some 'irregu- lar' /experimental variations into your play. They can be great fun, and you may find that several such lines are just as sound as the conventional ones. See Chapter 8. At this level, you will be advanced enough to play any logical first move, especially since, by virtue of moving first, White runs less risk of falling into trouble. This is also the time to in- troduce some specialization, regardless of the lines you choose. Most serious 1 e4 players tend to gravitate towards 1 e4 e5 2 lDf3 lDc6 3 i.b5 at some point or other, but remember that you can make a lifetime system out of 3 Sl.c4 if you like. Al- ternatives for the slightly eccentric player in- clude the King's Gambit with 2 f4 (be careful not to get your king in trouble), and the Bishop's Opening with 1 e4 e5 2 Sl.c4, followed in most cases by d3 (rather than trying to force through the move d4). Versus the Sicilian Defence, as mentioned, most players will be using the 2 lDf3 and 3 d4 main lines at least some of the time, although it's easy to get in positional trouble doing so against top players. I'd still try to mix in some of the systems without d4 that I listed for the Category C player. Versus the French Defence, you're on solid ground with any of 3 lDc3, 3 lDd2 or 3 e5; unfortu- nately, there's no escaping some theory if you want to use pawn-chain lines involving the move e5 (which you should, if you want both to learn about the opening and to maximize your chances). The main thing about all of your choices at this stage is that you would like to keep them in your repertoire for at least a few years. With luck, you will have them for the rest of your life, at least as a second or third weapon if you find something more attractive later on. Against the Pirc and Modem De- fences, I would still recommend staying with a simple lDc3/lDf3 system, but you can also start to play aggressive lines with f4 if you're will- ing to study theory, and early moves of the queen's bishop to e3 and g5 (normally fol- lowed by ~d2) are not that hard to learn. This is a great point for White to incorporate
1 d4 or 1 c4, excellent lifetime weapons which
have the further advantage that most of your peers will have spent less time preparing to play against them than versus 1 e4. Without going into detail, I'd recommend that after 1 d4, you go into lines involving 2 c4, and pick variations with clear-cut themes. For example, 1. .. d5 2 c4 e6 3 lDc3 followed by cxd5 is one of the more instructive openings in all of classical chess, and 1. .. d5 2 c4 c6 3lDf3 can be followed by any of several systems with e3 and lDc3 in one or another order. Those are safe and yet have plenty of impact. Against the King's Indian De- fence (l d4lDf6 2 c4 g6 with ... i.g7 and ... d6), players of a positional bent might want to head for a Fianchetto Variation (3 lDf3 i.g7 4 g3), and attackers will prefer 3 lDc3 i.g7 4 e4. But systems like 3lDc3 i.g7 4 i.g5 (or 4lDf3 d65 Sl.g5) are good compromises. Similarly, versus the Griinfeld Defence, 1 d4 lDf6 2 c4 g6 3 lDc3 d5, you may want to bypass the volumes of the- ory on 4 cxd5 lDxd5 5 e4 for a while and try 4 i.g5 or 4 i.f4 (or 4 lDf3 followed by those moves), provided that you study them enough to avoid tricks and violent counterattacks. The point is that you're not obliged to take up main lines and may very well want to wait with those
CHOOSING AND PREPARING OPENINGS 297
until you become a little more experienced. Similarly, versus 1 d4 l2Jf6 2 c4 e6, 3 l2Jf3 is positionally less committal than 3 l2Jc3 .ltb4, and a good choice. Nevertheless, you can learn a great deal by allowing 3 l2Jc3 .ltb4 and then accepting doubled pawns in return for poten- tially strong bishops by 4 a3, or by 4 e3 and, de- pending upon Black's response, 5 .ltd3 or 5 a3. At this stage such decisions become a matter of taste, and you can hardly go wrong in investi- gating all of these types of positions. 1 c4, the English Opening, is a first move that you can use for any occasion and indeed, some grandmasters play nothing else. A simple way to get started is to play 2 g3 against all of Black's normal moves 1...e5, 1...c5 and 1...l2Jf6. Later you'll almost certainly want to add in variations beginning with 2 l2Jc3 (or 2 l2Jf3), and be able to switch into some 1 d4 openings (for example, 1 c4 e6 2 d4 d5, 1 c4 c6 2 d4 d5 or 1 c4l2Jf6 2l2Jc3 g6 3 d4). Just don't think that you can go on autopilot after I c4. You need to have a specific answer to every major black set-up (and there are quite a few of these, be- cause 1 c4 doesn't limit Black's structural op- tions as much as 1 e4 and 1 d4 do). On the other hand, playing I c4 will expose you to a range of positions and structures that you can use in other openings. As Black in Category B, you should defi- nitely incorporate one or more major defences into your stock of weapons; hopefully you'll stick with these and learn them in considerable detail through practice and study. Within the major openings, some variations are clearly more manageable than others, so keep your eye out for those. Obviously I can't set forth a rep- ertoire for each major opening, but you should try to work with basic structures. If you're go- ing to play the Sicilian Defence at this stage, for example, you can consistently aim for ... d6 and ... e5 in most variations, or choose lines with ... d6 and ... e6 in every variation, or play ... g6 and ... d6 whenever you can. Keep in mind that, because the Sicilian is the most popular open- ing in chess, no opening has less surprise value. You'll be running into opponents who have been playing sharp lines against it for 20 years. So if you're taking the Sicilian up at this stage, you should put in a lot of serious study time, as well as commit to playing it for a few years. One way of doing this relatively painlessly would be to start with irregular variations of the Sicilian, some of which I mentioned in Chapter 8, and move to mainstream lines later. In the French Defence, Black Can steer the major variations into similar structures involv- ing d4 and e5 by White, unless White chooses to concede equality (i.e., by choosing exd5). The French is a good lifetime opening, either as a main defence or a back-up, because Black has so many sound ways to play and can shift from system to system when necessary. That is cer- tainly true of the Sicilian Defence, but perhaps less so with other major defences to 1 e4. The Caro-Kann Defence isn't as flexible; however, it is so inherently solid that it's hard to imagine any of the basic main lines proving unplayable, or even unpleasant enough to reduce the open- ing to an outsider status. It also requires less concrete study than most major openings. The Pirc Defence is an excellent choice for players who want to be able to switch between posi- tional play and dynamically-charged lines. I think that it is underrated as a defence and ap- propriate for any strength level. However, some players will get discouraged because they often end up having to play with less territory under their command than with many other openings. All of these choices include an element of per- sonal taste. Against 1 d4, this is a good point to pick up an Indian Defence. Like so many teachers, I would recommend the 1 ... l2Jf6, 2 ... e6 complex, because it's both solid and instructive. Versus the conventional 2 c4 lines, you would use the Nimzo-Indian (l d4l2Jf6 2 c4 e6 3l2Jc3 .ltb4), and either the Queen's Indian (l d4l2Jf6 2 c4 e6 3l2Jf3 b6) or the easier-to-learn Bogo-Indian (l d4l2Jf6 2 c4 e6 3l2Jf3 .ltb4+). Those inclined to sharper and somewhat riskier struggles might choose the King's Indian Defence (l d4l2Jf6 2 c4 g6 followed by ... .ltg7 and ... d6) or the Benoni (l d4l2Jf6 2 c4 c5). Of course, any other major defence is also playable. The one thing you want to be careful about versus 1 d4 is con- ceding too much space without knowing ex- actly why you're doing so. It would be nice to have something simple to play against 1 c4 and 1 l2Jf3; unfortunately, since White hasn't fully disclosed his inten- tions with these moves, Black has to be able to
298 MASTERING THE CHESS OPENINGS
respond to multiple set-ups. One way to ap- proach I c4 is to limit the number of reasonable options for White. For example, you can begin with 1...e5, and then if 2 lbc3, play 2 ... d6 or 2 ... ..Itb4, either of which limits White's choice of moves if he's genuinely trying for an advan- tage. For example, after I c4 e5 2 lbc3 d6, White ordinarily chooses between 3 d4, leading to 3 ... exd4 4 'iVxd4 lbc6, whereas against 3 lbf3 or 3 g3, 3 .. .f5 narrows White's options and keeps surprises to a minimum. After 2 g3, the variations 2 ... c6 and 2 ... lbf6 3 ..Itg2 c6 are positionally forcing. You can see how these strategies play out by referring to Volume 3 of this series. Versus I lbf3, someone who plays the Sicilian Defence might choose 1...c5 (al- lowing 2 e4), and then learn a system versus 2 c4, a Symmetrical English in which White has committed to 2 lbf3; the latter task isn't so hard. A Queen's Gambit defender might be happy to play I lbf3 d5, since 2 d4 will nor- mally transpose to that opening. And so forth. At the risk of boring the reader, I should em- phasize again that the suggestions above are merely a small subset of reasonable variations, selected to give you a feel for how you might choose openings at various levels. They are mainly given so that you have concrete advice to go by, rather than some airy generalities. But any time that you are strongly attracted to a cer- tain opening and have fun playing and studying it, that trumps other arguments. There is no sub- stitute for enjoyment when you're trying to learn something. Category A Openings Here we arrive at a point where overly-specific advice isn't very useful. At this level of strength, you can play any respectable opening without fear, and your repertoire can carry a theoretical load that would be unwieldy for a Category B player. In large part that's because a stronger player has a better understanding of and famil- iarity with chess positions, so he can absorb opening ideas and variations more quickly. Still, you won't want to beat your head against a wall by using what you thought were the lat- est discoveries in too many critical variations and then finding out that even your lower-rated opponents have played the same variations in dozens ofInternet games. My advice would be to play only a few fashionable main lines (three at most, fewer if you're so inclined), and fill in your repertoire with variations designed to make your opponent think on his own. You should also take into account whether you are good at retaining material that you have memorized; there's nothing worse than studying a line for days and then mixing up the moves when you finally get it over the board! At this level, a couple of irregular openings can be of value to counterbalance the detailed theoretical knowledge possessed by many ad- vanced opponents. In fact, many strong grand- masters benefit by judicious use of openings that are out of the mainstream. You can even implement this on move one; for example, I b3, I f4 and I lbc3 are candidates for White. As Black, you can save some time and playa 'uni- versal' system against 1 e4, 1 d4, 1 c4 and 1 lbf3; for example, l...g6, l...d6 or l...lbc6. However, be sure to employ these as secondary weapons for now. Using such moves exclu- sively can limit your general chess understand- ing; I have seen players damage their chess skills, and their long-term results, by never varying from 'safe' openings such as 1...g6 or, as White, the King's Indian Attack, Colle Sys- tem or 1 b3. Even a blind use of 1 c4 can be counterproductive (for example, using 2 g3 with studied avoidance of any central confron- tation). You simply have to keep the play sharp in a reasonable percentage of your openings if you want to improve. Unsound or merely 'tricky' openings are an- other problem. Since you will probably want to drop such openings from your repertoire later, they can represent a poor investment of study time now. In principle, you should never have to completely abandon the openings that you are playing at this stage, unless they are too de- manding to keep up with. That is, you should be able to employ them again from time to time. A few solid, less volatile, variations will serve you well in this respect; even if you're bored with them now, you'll inevitably find new ways to interpret them later. Many authors make the point that you should adjust your opening repertoire to your style of play. That's a tricky proposition, however, for several reasons. First, you may not have a
CHOOSING AND PREPARING OPENINGS 299
discernible style; most players don't have one until they become skilled at the game. Second, the openings that you use have already partially defined how you play, but that doesn't neces- sarily reveal a true 'style'. Furthermore, by studying openings of another character, you may find that you enjoy a different type of chess entirely, and that you play it well. At any rate, I don't think this advice would apply until you have reached at least master strength and have a true understanding of your strengths and weaknesses. Finally, as indicated above, it would be pre- sumptuous to give masters concrete sugges- tions about which openings to play; they have their own ideas and tastes. But in general, I be- lieve that strong players should try to have a flexible repertoire, broad enough to adjust to different opponents and different tournament situations.
2. Choose openings that will improve your play
On the face of it, this piece of advice may seem silly. Of course you want to improve your play, but can one opening really teach you more than another? I think that the answer is yes, even up to a fairly high level of player. For example, openings which lead towards 'automatic' play can retard your progress in terms of under- standing, and demand less in terms of creative thought. It's a bad sign when you find yourself going on autopilot. If you want to investigate certain structures more deeply, you might use two or more open- ings that are related. For example, you can get standard isolated d-pawn positions as White in certain lines of the Queen's Gambit, Nimzo- Indian, c3 Sicilian, and Panov Caro-Kann; and as Black in the Tarrasch Variation of the Queen's Gambit, the Tarrasch Variation of the French Defence, and other defences. Alternatively, you might want to adopt what I call the 'restraint structure', that is, ... c6/. .. e6 structures without a d-pawn (see the introductory chapters of Vol- ume 1). These can be found in a number of defences such as the Caro-Kann, the Slav and the Scandinavian. Many 1 e4 e5 openings fea- ture Black upholding a 'strong point' on e5 with a ... d6/ ... e5 structure, and the King's Indian De- fence often does the same, so it might provide a complementary defence to 1 d4. Sometimes there's a general resemblance between open- ings; for example, the moves ... e6 and ... .Bb4 are common to the Nirnzo-Indian Defence, the Ragozin Variation of the Queen's Gambit De- clined, the Winawer and McCutcheon Varia- tions of the French Defence, and a couple of variations of the English Opening (including the English Defence). You probably won't want to play all of these lines at once, but it doesn't hurt to consider similar piece placements when trying to find openings to your taste. Naturally, you should be careful not to over- indulge in this practice. After all, as I'm con- stantly saying, it's also important to learn as many structures as you can and expand your chess knowledge in the process. So, while you will do well to learn a few structures deeply, don't limit yourself by trying to force your rep- ertoire down a single path.
3. Be daring and play new openings
The legendary Viktor Korchnoi has said, bluntly, that if you want to improve your chess, you should play a new opening. I guess this is a variation on a theme that I'm starting to bore everyone with. But it's a controversial point of view, and one that not all coaches agree with. One traditional philosophy has it that you should specialize in your openings in order to under- stand them on a deep level. For one thing, by doing so, you can reasonably expect to avoid serious trouble early on. The more modem view, however, tends to be that it's important to learn about the game as a whole, and since different openings lead to distinct kinds of play, you will become a more complete player by exposing yourself to a wide range of positions. More- over, the freshness and creativity that you bring to the board will often compensate for lesser fa- miliarity, even to the extent of avoiding or set- ting early traps. Not surprisingly, a combination of these two approaches will probably serve you best, and in fact most strong players have a wide repertoire, but also a few favourite openings that they play more than the others. In any case, you shouldn't abandon any well-established opening based upon one loss. At the very least, you should re- search the opening to find out where you went
300 MASTERING THE CHESS OPENINGS
wrong (or where theory can be improved upon). And if you take up a new opening as your main weapon, play the old one from time to time, es- pecially if you can limit yourself to variations in which one new move by the opponent won't be likely to lead you into a bad position. After all, you've invested time into the first opening and it's foolish to waste it. In practice, I think that the tendency to cling to your habitual openings and be afraid to ex- periment is a greater danger than the disadvan- tages of superficially jumping around from opening to opening. Many of you will recog- nize that the more you play an opening, the more stale your thinking can become, leading to dogmatic moves and a tendency to miss un- usual ideas. Also, with the advent of databases and an explosion of resources for opening re- search, it doesn't take anywhere near as long as it did two decades ago to become quite familiar with the variations and ideas of a new opening. Granted, a panicky switch to a something new may not be a good idea against high-level oppo- nents. You should have a safe fallback opening in case of emergency. Similarly, if you know that your opponent, however strong, plays a certain variation against your favourite opening and you want to avoid it, be careful about con- cocting something too rapidly (for example, in the 10 minutes between the posting of the pair- ings and the beginning of the game!). The odds are that he is at least as familiar as you are with something that you've never played before. Furthermore, playing an opening for which you know all the themes and ideas is probably safer than trying to wing it. Naturally, if you think that your chosen variation will give you a sig- nificant disadvantage, see if you can play an- other variation within the same overall opening complex, or something as safe as you can find. Given time, adjusting to your opponent isn't a bad idea; maybe you know that you're playing him tomorrow, for example, or in a weekly tournament. Just be careful of precipitously abandoning what you're familiar with. Regardless of your circumstances, playing and studying even a limited number of games with a particular opening will probably teach you about kinds of positions that you hadn't previously encountered. That includes various positional ideas and tactics which will apply to other openings and middlegames. Furthermore, new positions are very helpful in improving your sense of timing, that is, how much you can sacrifice in one domain (for example, de- velopment) to gain in another (for example, structure). Finally, there's the obvious point that if you become disillusioned with a particu- lar opening, you may have an opportunity to play it from the other side of the board.
4. Don'tf eel constrained by the latest fashion
Just because leading grandmasters are playing something, that doesn't mean that it is 'best'; often their choice of openings is based upon practical considerations. For example, they may be intent upon causing specialized types of problems for their elite opponents, or even pro- tecting their ratings by finding drawish varia- tions for Black. It's amazing how many players tell me that they don't play some opening be- cause it's 'inferior' or 'unsound', when that opinion is based solely upon the fact that the top grandmasters aren't currently playing it, or that there was a single high-profile game in which one side got the better game and won. Keep in mind that all major openings are playable. To me, in addition, there is something slightly de- pressing about playing the same openings as elite grandmasters. Inevitably, those profes- sionals will be coming up with new ideas and working out the details faster than you could ever dream of doing yourself, so you're always in the role of a follower instead of a creator. Improving Your Opening Play After all is said and done, you want to improve your opening play. There are no magic tricks for doing that, but I'll give some advice and point to a number of training techniques for getting opening ideas to work in practice. Prep- aration and practice are obviously crucial, but the best ways to do so are not self-evident. To what extent you use computers to study and prepare, for example, is a much-debated ques- tion among chess teachers.
CHOOSING AND PREPARING OPENINGS 301
The most common questions from students have to do with how to go about learning open- ings. Naturally, that relates to how to play them well. First, understand that there are no magic shortcuts. If you read through chess literature or go to instructional sites on the web, you'll soon realize that no one can possibly imple- ment all of the various tips and strategies that are supposed to lead to improvement. Too much advice is probably worse than no advice at all unless you drastically narrow it down. I find it slightly irritating when authors and teachers come up with these lengthy lists of what to think about during a chess game; after their first 15 items to 'always keep in mind', they flood you with other 'common mental mistakes' and then start all over again in the next chapter or article! If you've read enough golf and tennis magazines, you'll recognize the problem: we can't play with more than a few tips in our minds at once. In fact, the most useful pieces of advice for the average chess-player to con- sciously refer to in the midst of battle are proba- bly simple reminders such as 'Pay attention to captures and checks' or 'When you're just about to make your move, take one more look at the most obvious replies'! The rest should become part of an organic thinking process. In the case of openings and early middlegames, crowding your thought-process with maxims is particu- larly ridiculous; if you want to escape the con- crete for a while, it's much better to step back from the position and consider what strategies go with the particular pawn-structure on the board, including the optimal spots for each piece. This can be done on your opponent's thinking time. Something similar applies with respect to the ubiquitous advice about opening play and study techniques: there are too many considerations for anyone to handle, and too many hypotheti- cal goals to achieve. What's more frustrating, I don't think that any such advice is universal; whether it works depends upon the individual and what chess skills they've acquired. More- over, some questions have no correct answers. For example: should you memorize openings or learn their ideas? That varies according to cir- cumstance, skill level, and inclination. In this section, I'll be setting forth a wide variety of methods for preparing and studying openings, which taken together would overwhelm their purpose. So by all means look over this ad- vice, but then pick and choose what seems useful for you, and don't try to do too much at once.
1. Committing to and recording a repertoire
Let's assume that you've chosen your major openings and top-level variations according to the guidelines described above (or not). You probably won't be sure about what to do against all or even most of the subvariations. It's even more likely that you won't know how to answer the wide variety of individual lines that your opponent can throw at you. Therefore, as you proceed, you'll need to arrive at a more detailed provisional repertoire, which will almost cer- tainly be adjusted as time passes. The process of filling out details in a reper- toire is in itself a means of learning and im- provement. To do this, you first need to see how the opening breaks down into variations and subvariations. Books are helpful in that regard; for example, an encyclopaedic openings com- pendium should make it clear what the main variations of an opening are. You might also skim through the Contents list of a book special- izing in a particular opening or set of openings, and use the Index of Variations if it has one. Still another method is to use a database to find a large set of games with the opening to see how frequently various lines occur. In fact, most da- tabases have an option of ordering games by opening, to any desired level of subvariations. Then it's time to pick the lines you wish to play. For now, choose one line versus any varia- tion that you need to have an answer for. Later you will be adding options, but at this point we'll take a linear approach. Take your time and find something compatible with your tastes, testing a few lines on the Internet or at the club. Speciality books and repertoire books will sug- gest certain variations and provide good refer- ences as you continue to play the opening. Alternatively, you may adopt a variation that a friend plays, or choose to try out some line that you saw in a game in a magazine. If you have a teacher, he can recommend openings and varia- tions; just be wary of any teacher who tries to foist most of his own repertoire on you, in
302 MASTERING THE CHESS OPENINGS
particular if it means discarding what you cur- rently play. In each case, ask if an opening is too complex or theoretical to use at your cur- rent playing strength. Some players like to look at what variations the specialists in certain openings are choosing, on the grounds that they know what they're doing. Copying a grand- master's entire repertoire isn't good, in my opinion. You'll tend to end up with too 'profes- sional' a repertoire, constructed for another player's purposes (for example, a top player may only want to draw with Black). Having decided upon a set of opening varia- tions to start out with, it is essential to docu- ment what you've chosen, including the main lines and however many provisional variations that you are willing to commit to. This abso- lutely requires that you chart out your new rep- ertoire in some handy format. There are several ways of doing so, but whatever method you use, save copies of your older repertoires even when you move on to revised ones. The first option is rather primitive, but may appeal to those who still prefer physical media such as paper over electrons. It consists of man- ually written charts, possibly in tree form, which list the chosen variations and subvariations. This corresponds with the famous 'notebooks' that the great masters of old used to carry around with them. Another common method is (was) to use index cards. On a slightly higher level of sophistication, you can enter the same information into a word-processing program on a computer. Then it can be either printed out or read on the screen. One benefit of doing it this way is that the chart can be modified and edited with a few key- strokes. The most sophisticated and best way to re- cord a repertoire is to use a chess database pro- gram such as ChessBase or Chess Assistant. Using ChessBase, for example, you can create a single game with an overall tree of the main moves of each opening you use. Then you can create 'games' containing each variation (or subvariation), doing so to whatever degree of detail you desire. Here are just a few advan- tages of this approach:
1. You can play over every move of the rep-
ertoire on the screen, going back and forth through the variations.
2. You can change the moves whenever you
want to without having to rewrite.
3. You can include verbal commentary,
cross references, and printable diagrams wher- ever you choose.
4. You can take relevant games from other
databases and merge in the ones that you think will be helpful.
5. You can tum on an analytical engine and
have it assess positions in your repertoire, as well as suggesting alternate moves.
6. You can always look at and/or print out
the repertoire in chart form, or game form if you prefer that.
7. You can catch transpositions more easily.
These days, not surprisingly, just about ev- ery serious player uses a database program to construct their repertoire. It doesn't take much computer literacy to learn how to get your moves entered, after which they are automati- cally ready to replay. The actual information that you use in your files needn't come solely from databases; in fact, opening books are still by far the best source for most players, and you will want to input analysis from them into the repertoire file in your chess program. In fact, the process of keying in moves from books is an excellent way to fix them in your mind. I rec- ommend it for everyone from beginner on up. Having recorded everything in orderly form, you can and should periodically review your repertoire to see which variations aren't work- ing well, which need more study, and which you find unpleasant to play. These can be replaced, but only after a good-faith effort to solve the problem by making minor adjustments, picking different subvariations, and looking for different ways to play the same basic positions. Of course, you can always expand the repertoire at any juncture and have two options available.
2. Strategy, tactics and memorization
After some study of an opening, and perhaps experience with it, I strongly recommend ex- plicitly writing down the typical strategies and themes that go with a variation. This includes basic goals, tactical motifs, opening traps, typi- cal piece positions, standard manoeuvres, po- tential pawn-breaks, common pawn-structures
CHOOSING AND PREPARING OPENINGS 303
(perhaps with a few characteristic endings), and probable middlegame plans (including po- tential weaknesses to attack). You should make up an ordered list of these ideas; it's helpful if you yourself decide how you want to organize such a list, and what should be included in it. How complete or even accurate your list is doesn't matter as much as getting it down on paper to refer to. Also, don't forget to go through this process for both White and Black! That is, you need to be aware of your oppo- nent's ideas as well as your own. This task should be done early on in your repertoire-creation process, and not put off. De- pending upon your outlook, such careful chart- ing might be slightly boring, certainly more so than playing, but in that case you can make the list fairly quickly and then come back to it later in order to add to, modify or delete items, based upon the games that you play and books that you read. I'd be sure to keep an eye out for typi- cal tricks and tactics in your openings; if you fall for one of these, everything else is irrele- vant, at least for that particular game. At the same time, don't undervalue straight- forward memorization of opening moves. Most players will find that, as they memorize open- ings, they will absorb by osmosis most of the typical themes and structures. After all, memo- rization in chess is a method of acquiring real knowledge, just as it is in the sciences, crafts, and most fields. The more that you play over opening moves, even by rote, the better they will be absorbed and some of the wisdom be- hind them will inevitably sink into your con- sciousness. Naturally, memorization isn't suf- ficient to make you a strong player; indeed, there's a kind of overdependence on it that can lead to the common mistake of playing the same move in a completely inappropriate posi- tion. So you need perspective, and becoming aware of why you're making particular moves has to be combined with blunt memorization; fortunately, these are not exclusive processes. You'll also want to start thinking about move- order issues, which I have strongly emphasized in this series. As you develop your openings, think about how you will concretely answer each order in which your opponent can play his moves, and how you might adjust your own move-order to your advantage. This can be decided upon gradually, and may even take years to pin down completely.
3. Study model games interactively
The best teachers universally recommend study- ing master games to improve your play. In the case of opening study, an obvious method is to choose games directly from an opening book, ideally finding copies of them in your database and collecting them in one place. You can also collect a series of games from a database with the desired opening variation, and then sort them according to rating, so that you see how the best players handle the positions first. If you have narrowed down the variation to a particu- lar line, you may even be able to play through every game with it. Still another useful technique for gathering samples is to use the games of a specialist in each line. This is also easy to do with a database - by examining the openings key, you will soon recognize who has played the variation for the longest time (in certain contexts, there may be a function informing you directly about who the most frequent practitioners are). The same goes for reading opening books with an eye towards the opponents in relevant games. Often a partic- ular player is closely associated with an opening variation, either as Black or White, although it makes for a more productive experience to pick at least two or more players, in order to com- pare treatments and find lines where you can implement your own ideas. Having located games, the way in which you study them will depend upon your time and en- ergy, but most teachers will recommend that you participate actively in the learning pro- cess. Rather than simply playing the moves over, try predicting (or guessing at) them your- self. Ideally you will take enough time thinking about them that you get a good grip on the rele- vant positions. The traditional way to do this is to set up a board and place a book in front of you, or use a paper copy of the game. You can generate a printed copy of games with any seri- ous database program, and include diagrams if that works for you. Cover up the moves (with, e.g., a piece of paper, ruler or index card) while analysing the position. With the right physical set-up, you will be able to uncover one move at
304 MASTERING THE CHESS OPENINGS
a time. The truly dedicated student can try to predict both sides' moves, but it's probably more realistic to analyse continuations from 'your' side of the board, and you can get through more material if you do so. Not surprisingly, you can also go through this process with a da- tabase program. ChessBase, for example, has a 'Training mode' that reveals only one move at a time as you work out the next move. Some very strong players have emphasized that it helps to periodically use a physical board to play over games (rather than the computer monitor), because that's how you will be seeing things at a tournament. You will always benefit most from analysing a position deeply, but realistically, studying opening theory involves a lot of material and you probably won't get to enough games or variations if you worry over each move in every game. As time progresses, you will be able to identify one or two positions from the opening of each game that require the most serious con- sideration. If you only have time to spend a minute or so on a move, at least this approxi- mates the time you might actually get in a real game! Some teachers recommend using a clock to discipline your time management. With respect to available study time, you have one more decision to make. For your gen- eral chess education, there's nothing better than analysing the whole game using the cover-up method. But if your goal is to study openings, you simply won't get through enough helpful material unless you cut the process short as the middlegame begins, and stop there or quickly play through the remaining moves, by hand or on a screen. Of course, it's hard to assess where the border between opening and middlegame is, so you'll have to get a feel for where to stop as you play over more games. In this respect, it's probably easier to use the games in an opening book (or DVD) than in a games collection, but you can do both. See the next section for further thoughts on how to improve this procedure. I suggest using a mix of annotated and un- annotated games. The former allow you to com- pare the thoughts of a strong player with your own. The latter force you to think more about a position, and accustom you to playing more creatively without an ever-present authority lurking in your mind.
4. Creative learning: what if ... ?
As mentioned, you can apply the active method above to opening books and articles as well as games collections. But I didn't explicitly men- tion what is perhaps the most important part of the process: asking the question 'What if he [your opponent] plays move X? What happens then?'. If you do this consistently for most of the moves that you're looking at, and answer the questions as you go along, you will improve at an accelerated rate and greatly broaden your perspective on anything you study. Further- more, you'll find that sometimes there's no clear answer to your question about a proposed move, or perhaps no good reply at all. That means that you've come up with a worthwhile new move. It turns out that there are plenty of them; every player, once he's learned the rules and played some games, can find moves that haven't been tried before (at least moves that aren't in the books or generally known). Some- times, in fact, the less you know the better. When I began to play chess, the books available to me were mostly games collections, and I was already a passably competent player before I ran into opening pamphlets and the like. So I became my own main source of ideas for the opening, taking the first moves of a game from a collection and using the 'What if. .. ?' method. After a while, it wasn't that difficult to put my own stamp on the variations I played. That still holds true today. You should be able to personalize your repertoire with a small improvement here or there, a change of move- orders, or even a new strategy entirely. If you play very sharp lines, you may find a block- buster novelty in a tactical situation; of course, that is much more likely if you stay away from the most popular lines of the day. Even if you don't introduce new moves, ask- ing the 'What if. .. ?' question can lead you to understand the subtleties of a variation, which might result in taking up some move that has previously been regarded as inferior, or aban- doning a variation that is supposed to be good for you (and doing so before you lose a game with it!). Sometimes you may decide that you'd like to incorporate the line into your repertoire, but only when you're playing with the opposite colour!
CHOOSING AND PREPARING OPENINGS 305
Players everywhere will tell you that finding new opening moves or charting new territory in the opening is among the most rewarding expe- riences that comes from study. For some, it is their proudest achievement in chess.
5. Practice makes perfect
Not surprisingly, it is vital to play your openings as often as possible. This can be done in casual play and tournaments, against computers, or in online playing situations. These days, most se- rious players take advantage of the latter possi- bility, and there are numerous playing sites on which to do so. In general, inexperienced play- ers can get by using a free or inexpensive site, and that may be the proper budgetary decision. But as you get more serious, the major pay sites such as Internet Chess Club or Playchess offer the strongest opposition and the chance to sit in on grandmaster games, along with many fea- tures that other sites don't offer. You should do your own investigation before deciding what fits your needs. There are other ways to make your practice more efficient and rewarding. For example, if you're trying to learn an opening as Black, practice playing it from the white side, and vice-versa. You can even set up a series of games with a partner and agree to play the same variation again and again. Such practice is ide- ally suited for online play, and this is one situa- tion in which I can recommend blitz games (in sensible, non-addictive, quantities). Otherwise, for the sake of opening practice, try to make your online games at a lO-minute or preferably IS-minute time-control (or longer, if it's possi- ble to find an opponent). In that way, you get to reflect a little about the opening and early middlegame issues before descending into a time-scramble. It's even worth sacrificing some rating points by taking an impractical amount of time to emphasize opening accuracy instead of results; after all, it doesn't take too long to get your online rating back to its natural level. Finally, many players test their openings by playing against a computer program. That's an excellent way to gain experience, and puts the learning process under your control; for exam- ple, you can pause the play and contemplate the position, look up the line in a book, jot down what's happening, or take a break to eat some- thing. One drawback to this kind of study is that it takes place in a less competitive atmosphere than online play, and might make your transi- tion to over-the-board games more difficult. In addition, you might find that you miss the so- cial element of the game; of course, that might be an improvement when you consider some online behaviour!
6. Over the board
This chapter isn't about psychological issues, but let me devote a few words to playing open- ings in real, over-the-board situations (for ex- ample, at tournaments). Right away, I believe that it's a mistake to blitz out opening moves at a rapid-fire pace. For one thing, it's rather ob- noxious, and may unnecessarily provoke more determined play from your opponent. More im- portantly (for most players, anyway), you will probably play an unintended move from time to time. This can happen even if you're familiar with an opening and wide awake. For example, you might be prepared to make a certain stan- dard move in any case, but then fail to adjust to your opponent's unexpected move. Or you play your moves in the wrong order, which is, inci- dentally, a common time-trouble slip. Probably the most frequent mistake when slamming out the opening moves is to playa customary move automatically, and then suddenly remember that you had actually decided to play something different if you ever reached the position. All these possibilities are very unlikely to happen if you take more than five seconds per move. And pressing the clock with normal force goes a long way towards establishing your maturity. Next, you have to realize and accept that you'll seldom get the exact subvariation that you're hoping for, that you'll often not get the exact variation, and sometimes, you won't even end up in the right opening! The bald fact is that there are two of you playing, and your oppo- nent has his own preparation as well as limits on his theoretical knowledge. So he may devi- ate into a sideline, use a move-order that you hadn't anticipated, or playa new move, whether intentionally or not. How should you react when you are sur- prised by an unexpected opening move, and are
306 MASTERING THE CHESS OPENINGS
unsure of whether you're facing something new? The obvious answer, one given by some books and teachers, is that you should avoid speculating about your opponent's knowledge and play the position objectively, at normal speed, just as you would any random middle- game position. After all, unexpected moves are commonplace throughout a game. But in fact, it's absolutely justified to hit the reset button and take an unusual amount of time to think. After all, your opponent hasn't studied that ran- dom middlegame position, but there's a good possibility that he has studied this particular opening and therefore a chance, although hardly a certainty, that his last move is a prepared novelty. If so, then there are more likely to be different kinds of issues in the position, and possibly tricks for you to negotiate. What's more, small mistakes are more likely to be pun- ished when your opponent has had time to re- flect about the possibilities away from the board. So additional caution is desirable. It's also pos- sible that the surprise move is an inferior one, or an outright mistake (after all, there may be a good reason why you haven't seen it before). In that case, taking extra time to check for a possi- ble flaw is also worthwhile. In either case, don't feel intimidated into making a quick re- sponse. While it may be more macho to throw down a 'You-don't-scare-me', Try-that-out- for-size' move, you really should expend some resources at this first critical juncture of the game. Finally, a time-honoured question in chess is whether to 'play the board' or 'play the oppo- nent'. My general inclination in the middle- game is to play the board, which means to make your moves without taking the tastes or foibles of your specific opponent into account. That doesn't eliminate speculation, or playing dif- ferently against different strength opponents, or even making objectively inferior moves in the hope of causing your opponents more prob- lems. Rather, it means that you make most de- cisions independent of an assessment of the id- iosyncrasies of opponents, or of their perceived tendencies to play weakly in certain types of positions and strongly in others. In choosing your openings, however, both before and during the game, I think that you have your best opportunity to 'play the opponent', that is, if you're quite sure that you're familiar with someone's style and preferences, it makes sense to guide the play away from those. For example, many wild attacking players don't like simplified positions, especially with the queens off. Other positionally-oriented players become uncomfortable in out-of-control tacti- cal positions. I think that it's too risky and diffi- cult to try to channel the direction of the play in the middlegame or endgame; for one thing, their assessments will be approximate and the final positions fuzzy. But in the opening, be- cause of previous and fixed knowledge, you can be almost sure whether a certain kind of po- sition can be forced, and what the evaluations of the resulting variations are. Therefore you'll know what, if anything, you are sacrificing in objective terms by forcing the play in a certain direction. Putting this together, I'd say that it's all right to play opening variations that take into account your opponent's style, but be care- ful not to lean too heavily upon the practice.
7. Chess information and the openings
In today's chess world, there are more sources of information and analysis about openings than can possibly be kept track of. Here's a brief guide to what's out there:
1. For starters, you can find multiple open-
ing books about every conventional opening, as well as books about most of their variations, and even some about subvariations. If you include books written in various languages, literally hundreds of opening books by master-strength players appear each year. Some of these are ap- pearing in e-book form as well. One enormous advantage of opening books is that you have a strong player (usually an expert in the line) sorting through hundreds of variations to show you the important and recommended ones. The author of an opening book also organizes the important material in an opening by filtering out the vast numbers of games with which the reader needn't be concerned in practical play. In addition, most books these days have a great many recommendations for how to improve upon current theory. Remarkably, these recom- mendations sometimes go years before they seep into top-level play and become the main moves.
CHOOSING AND PREPARING OPENINGS 307
2. The most significant longstanding periodic
publications with an emphasis on openings are the Informator series, which has annotations by strong and elite grandmasters, and the New in Chess Yearbooks, which consist of opening ar- ticles by leading experts. ChessBase Magazine, an electronic magazine on DVD, publishes nu- merous opening surveys in each issue.
3. In electronic form, DVDs about chess
openings have expanded. Be warned that these are mostly of poor quality, but there are notable exceptions, primarily in the series of high- quality DVD videos from ChessBase.
4. Many websites are loaded with informa-
tion about openings. Every year, the website ChessPublishing produces the equivalent of many books' worth of opening material, all an- notated by grandmasters, along with e-books summarizing the information. Elsewhere on the Web, innumerable teaching sites, blogs, and players' home pages have opening analysis.
5. Chess magazines not only have many
games annotated in detail by leading players, but they often contain separate opening articles. Almost every country has a national publica- tion, and many other wonderful magazines are published around the world. It wouldn't be fair for me to recommend particular ones, but you can combine the recommendations of friends and use web searches to pick out some, perhaps on a trial basis.
6. Finally, we have the amazing world of da-
tabase programs, which can organize millions of games according to opening, instantly pull up all games in a certain position, search for struc- tures, and save these in an accessible format. Increasingly, players (especially already-knowl- edgeable professionals) use database programs to research the latest games and improve their own repertoires. With their years of exposure to opening ideas and large blocks of available time, some grandmasters practically live off databases to satisfy their opening theory needs. That isn't realistic or even desirable for the non-professional, however. For the majority of us, an opening book is still the best way to un- derstand a variation's positional and tactical ideas, and to pick up intelligent suggestions. One reason for this is that it's difficult to assess the worth of the moves that you find from data- bases. When doing searches, I sometimes filter out all games below a certain rating level, and I also try to include all the annotated games that I can find; nevertheless, I'm continually sur- prised by how often this gives a wrong impres- sion about what the best lines really are. In ad- dition, with the arm's-length view that comes from a database search, it's not easy to decide which variations are practical or which move- order problems will prevent you from getting the positions that you're after. By contrast, when a titled author has reviewed, thought about, and (ideally) played an opening, he will have insights and explanations that the average player can't generate on his own. In conclusion, there's a lot to consider when choosing and preparing your openings. In this chapter I've attempted to provide a basis for do- ing so, as well as address the issue of how best to study openings. You by no means need to ap- ply everything or even most of what I've rec- ommended; in fact, it's probably best to keep your mind focused and apply only one or two things at a time! But regardless of its immediate value, I hope that this chapter provides a refer- ence when you're in doubt about how to proceed with your chess openings and your develop- ment as a player.
10 The Future of Openings
Having described the range of openings used in contemporary chess, I don't think there's much doubt about their vitality in the immediate fu- ture. These days, it's hard for us to imagine that in the 1920s, Capablanca and Lasker were fret- ting about how opening theory had progressed to such an extreme that chess had become fun- damentally limited. At the time, it was sug- gested that no one could win against a skilled master if he chose certain openings (the Caro- Kann was a particular worry, leading Reti to re- ject 1 e4 altogether, and the Queen's Gambit Declined seemed an insurmountable barrier versus 1 d4). That being the case, the percent- age of draws would increase dramatically until we reached a state called 'the death of chess'. Capablanca even proposed a change of rules to counteract this perceived problem. We occasionally hear mutterings to this ef- fect today, but I think that the current situation is similar to what it actually was in those times. Ever since this concern surfaced, the number of legitimate openings, variations, and subvariations used by grandmasters has ex- ploded without pause, and 80 years later that process is accelerating. There are more unan- swered questions in the entire set of practical openings today, and more difficulties in play- ing them, than could have been imagined by the grandmasters in the 1970s and 1980s, much less those from Capablanca's time. When it comes to computers, another source of concern, you could argue that the death of chess by endgames is more likely than its death by openings! At least the complexity of end- games, as demonstrated by the development of comprehensive endgame tablebases, is limited enough to be handled with perfect play for up to 6 pieces (4, excluding the kings). By contrast, chess programs are at their worst in the open- ing, as long as they are 'out of book'; by defini- tion, the opening is the most complicated part of the game in terms of the number of possible future continuations. Granted, it is often more manageable for us as humans than a random middle game since we have a body of accumu- lated knowledge and recognize recurring struc- tures. But the number of opening permutations is so great, and the difficulties of assessment so far beyond the grasp of the most powerful com- puter ever contemplated, that we can be confi- dent about the game's longevity in that respect. When we get to specifics, the issues are more involved, and vary sharply from group to group. Even professional players use different approaches to their choice of openings based upon their strategies regarding both competi- tion and rating. Let's begin at the very top, with World Champions and their top-ten peers. To the dismay of many fans, some elite players employ a 'win-as-White, hold-as-Black' strat- egy, a policy reflected in their opening choices. That is not a bad way to win closed tourna- ments; and equally importantly, to avoid rating disasters. Thus we see some of the top-ten play- ers resorting to similar variations over many years. Ex-World Champion Vladimir Kramnik, for example, has used a number of solid open- ings as Black versus 1 e4, such as the Petroff Defence, Sveshnikov Sicilian (which has be- come notoriously drawish at the top levels, de- spite its aggressive and dynamic nature), and famously, the Berlin Defence to the Ruy Lopez. His drawing percentage as Black is a rather hefty 56%. Supergrandmaster Peter Leko plays some of the same openings, as well as the Mar- shall Attack, an aggressive gambit which pro- duces very forcing play that often ends in a draw. His drawing percentage as Black is 60%. Anatoly Karpov, a World Champion famous for his conservative style, has used the Caro-Kann Defence and various 1 e4 e5 defences induding the Petroff. He sports a 54% drawing ratio as Black. You will find that these same opening variations are used disproportionately by several other supergrandmasters (in comparison to the practice of professional players in general). A somewhat different situation arises versus I d4.
THE FUTURE OF OPENINGS 309
The leading players exhibit more variety, al- though almost everyone includes the super-solid l...liJf6 and 2 ... e6 (the Nimzo-Indian/Queen's Indian complex) in their repertoires, sometimes exclusively, as well as a large number of games with 1...d5, the other most conservative first move. To the extent that 1 d4 play sometimes tums wild, it usually does so because White feels obliged to try to win against an inherently solid opening such as the Slav or Queen's In- dian, and is even willing to sacrifice a pawn or two in that effort. By contrast, it's worth noting how World Champions Bobby Fischer and Garry Kaspar- ov, the two most prominent players of the mod- em era, made winning as Black an integral part of their approach. Fischer drew only 37% of his games as Black and won 51 % (versus consider- ably lower average opposition, to be sure); whereas Kasparov drew only 48% of his games with Black and won 40%, far ahead of his con- temporaries. They both specialized in the dy- namic Sicilian Defence, and both initially used the double-edged King's Indian and Griinfeld Defences as Black, turning to more solid ap- proaches later in their careers. Kasparov ulti- mately went through every major system versus 1 d4, and naturally played them all well. We also find a contemporary set of top play- ers who lean in the Fischer/Kasparov direction, and take many more forays in experimental di- rections. It will surprise no one who follows their games, for example, that Veselin Topalov and Alexei Shirov, who boast of wide reper- toires filled with active openings, have had un- usually low drawing percentages with both White and Black; nor that the eccentric Alexan- der Morozevich and aggressive Judit Polgar have Fischer-like drawing percentages. So even the accelerated growth of professionalism at the top hasn't taken the life out of the game. The up-and-coming younger stars have, as a rule, very wide repertoires, which is promising, and engage willingly in complicated fights. However, it's too early to say whether that will translate into low drawing percentages as they assume the ranks of the world's best. Perhaps faster time-controls will have their effect as well. I do think that courageous play will con- tinue to be rewarded, as it has for most of chess history. At the current time, I find that the most inter- esting opening play (and games, for that mat- ter) tends to come from the next couple of tiers of players. Most professionals below a certain world rank, perhaps 15-20, don't have enough invitations to support themselves, and so they play extensively in leagues, team events, and Swiss System tournaments. Under these cir- cumstances, a higher proportion of wins is nec- essary for success, and the 'hold as Black' philosophy is much less prominent. Thus, every month, we see an amazing array of openings used by extremely strong players (including those on their way up or down in the rankings). To be more precise, every major opening dis- cussed in this series gets tested in numerous subvariations, and even very minor openings are consistently represented at the level of mas- ters, albeit somewhat less as the competition stiffens. You can explore this on your own by downloading games from a number of promi- nent websites. Is this set of players using a wider variety of openings since, at 50-100 points below supergrandmaster levels, they can count on their opponents' less precise play? That is extremely unlikely, especially since theory is spread and devoured at outrageous speed these days, and every grandmaster has his own pre- pared ideas versus every opening. Then what's the difference? For one thing, a very limited number of openings are being played consis- tently by the highest-rated players at anyone time, because in exclusive tournaments they tend to dispute the latest fashionable openings. Nevertheless, those openings are changing on a regular basis, if sluggishly, as they have in ev- ery period of modem chess history, especially post-WWII. So the idea that openings are 'infe- rior' because they aren't consistently played at supertournaments is simply misguided. Right now the French Defence (the third most popu- lar e-pawn defence by quite a margin) is only played on a frequent basis by two of the world's top ten players, but I'd be surprised if anyone, with plenty of time on their hands, could show me how to get a forced advantage versus the French. Openings such as the Pirc Defence, the Dutch Defence and the King's Indian Defence are in good theoretical shape at the moment, and who can say that, objectively, they give Black a greater disadvantage than, say, any of a
310 MASTERING THE CHESS OPENINGS
number of Closed Ruy Lopez lines? Yet right at the moment you won't see them played much until you drop below the top ten. Even the most maligned of openings may ultimately equalize; out of the blue, for example, Carlsen and others began to play the Alekhine Defence with suc- cess, and a variety of lesser 1 e4 e5 variations appear to be perfectly sound. If you look at the actual theory as well as practice, it seems as though, played accurately, almost any major e- pawn or d-pawn defence will achieve a de facto equality at a certain point of the game. This leads to two main questions: how early does that ulti- mate equality express itself and, on a related note, how hard is it to reach a level game in over-the-board play? These are practical mat- ters. It would be great if we could evaluate openings these days by including a number or designation reflecting how difficult each open- ing is to handle! That degree of difficulty trans- lates directly into how likely it is that you'll make a mistake or, if not, run into time-pressure. It's not always important in practice whether you stand equal, or slightly better, or slightly worse in theory, if on every move you're con- fronted with problems that are especially hard to solve. I could probably make a good theoretical case for the objective equality of the Modem Benoni after many accurate moves. But the dif- ficulty of finding those moves is arguably much higher than finding the right moves in the Nimzo-Indian Defence or Queen's Gambit De- clined. Clearly, that will be reflected on the play- ers' clocks. From White's viewpoint, the same consideration applies: versus accurate play by Blaek, no opening is likely to give him a forced advantage in the long run. But the mainstream ones tend to retain some edge into the early middlegame, and continue to pose nontrivial problems for Black thereafter. I discussed this in Chapter 6, where I suggested that White's pref- erence for 'mainstream' openings such as the Ruy Lopez and Queen's Gambit over the Scotch Game or London System has more to do with the first two's ability to pose lasting difficulties than to any abstract theoretical superiority. But whether a certain opening tends to equal- ize more easily than another has limited rele- vance for the average player. In general, the words 'draw' and 'drawish' have become outra- geously overused. In middlegames with two vulnerable kings and a material imbalance, even grandmasters commentating live on websites will say 'The position is drawn now' , or 'draw- ish', although a 2700+ player then manages to lose it after errors by both players have given them alternately winning positions! One diffi- culty here is the reliance on computer assess- ments: a '-0.10', even if accurate, doesn't distinguish between easily drawn king-and- pawn endings and complex positions with a high probability of a decisive result. The other problem is the egoism of annotators and com- mentators, who want to show how easy chess is for them, and act as though they're shocked when great players make minor errors (some- times given '??' for dramatic effect) which re- sult in one side being able to win a complex position with perfect play. In view of this, imag- ine how far away from a draw you must be in the opening! Barring cases of a particular varia- tion or subvariation that leads to a draw by rep- etition, that should be your last worry. To be sure, aiming for complex and/or dynamic posi- tions in at least some of your games is generally good for your chess, but not for the sake of avoiding draws. You can confirm that by exam- ining the allegedly drawish symmetrical lines that I've written about in this series; they may seem dull, but they almost always afford real- istic winning chances. So be sceptical when someone tells you that one opening or another is 'drawish'; arguably, none are. Returning to high-level play, I think that the general positional character of the opening is a major determinant of its appeal. For example, throughout the history of chess, the best players have unquestionably preferred having positions with more space (that is, with control over more territory). Arguably, all of the World Cham- pions have been partial to space, excepting pos- sibly Steinitz and Petrosian at certain times during their careers. While modem masters have incorporated quite a few more restricted positions into their repertoires (for one thing, the Sicilian Defence is currently played in 20- 25% of all games), I'd say that this preference persists, albeit in diminished form. Quite apart from the objective worth of openings in which Black controls less space, they tend to be more difficult to play, at least for the majority of play- ers. Furthermore, in master play, there seems to
THE FUTURE OF OPENINGS 311
be a practical differentiation (if not a clear one) between defences involving fianchettoes and those without. The fonner, even when sound and objectively worthwhile, seem to require greater accuracy. The Modem Defence (l...g6) and l...b6 are the most obvious examples, and some grandmasters would say the same about the Modem Benoni and the King's Indian De- fence. Still, there are prominent exceptions; for example, the Queen's Indian Defence isn't usu- ally looked upon in this fashion, nor is the Grtinfeld; and the Sicilian Dragon rolls merrily along. So there are no hard-and-fast rules. And naturally, these considerations are much less meaningful at a lower level, where games are seldom decided upon the basis of territorial control. In fact, defending territory is often harder for the lower-level player than playing with less of it! Nevertheless, along the same lines, most strong players seem to have found that, in re- sponse to I e4, l...e5, the French Defence, and the Caro-Kann Defence are easier to handle in practice than most other systems. Both l...e5 and the French Defence establish an actual stake in the centre, and the Caro-Kann, while surrendering the centre by ... dxe4 in the main lines, opens the d-file and creates room for cen- tral piece activity. The latter is missing in most variations of the Sicilian, Pirc and Alekhine Defences, and that can make them more difficult to handle in practice. Perhaps as players be- come more proficient at managing positions with less space, variations involving spatial deficits will acquire a status of practical as well as theoretical equality. That is already the case with well-established variations of the Sicilian Defence which were looked upon unfavourably in earlier times. If this increased skilfulness proves to be the general case, a positive conse- quence would be the expansion of creative pos- sibilities in the opening. That is certainly the current trend, considering how many new early moves are suddenly becoming respectable. One happy side-effect already is that Internet play- ers and club players, who are experimenting constantly, have become important contribu- tors to the discovery process. As an amateur, you can have an independent say about opening theory and more importantly, feel free of its constraints. I won't need to convince most ac- tive players of this, certainly not my students and friends, who are both extending established lines and trying out new ones. How long will all this last? There's no way of telling. But I wouldn't argue with the con- tinuation of the current direction of events, particularly since the scope of opening theory has expanded steadily for 150 years. In any case, you should take advantage of the oppor- tunity to go in new directions with your own play. Index of Openings for Volume 4 Numbers refer to pages. Codes are from the ECO system. Misc.
