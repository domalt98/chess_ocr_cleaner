Volume 1 examined the move 1 e4 and openings that derive from it. Volume 2 moved on to 1 d4 openings. Predictably, many readers and players were disappointed at the lack of coverage of the move 1 c4, otherwise known as the English Opening. 1 c4 is not only the logical partner to 1 e4 and 1 d4, but in itself a wonderful grounds for the study of positional ideas that encompass the entire range of chess prac- tice. It can be very useful as a complement to openings arising from 1 d4 and 1 lLlf3, since we find many overlapping themes; furthermore, transpositions from and to the English Opening abound af- ter those moves. Given all these considerations, this new volume seemed a good idea. Fortunately, I have an extensive history of writing about 1 c4, beginning with a set of four volumes in 1980 and continuing intermittently through my recent English Opening column for ChessPublishing.com. As in previous volumes, I shall work from the ground up, starting with very elementary choices on the first couple of moves, including ones that you will seldom or perhaps never see, in order to explain the elementary properties of the English Opening. For a primer or refresher on the first principles of opening play in general, see Chapter 1 of Volume 1. The next two chapters of that vol- ume may also be useful, since they identify the ideas and themes most often referred to in the book as a whole. This investigation of fundamentals is hardly the whole story, however. By the time that I get deeply into a given chapter, the complexity of my presentation increases and there will be mate- rial that should be sophisticated enough to appeal to players of all levels. Even in those sections, I have tried to talk about variations and typical positions on a very broad and basic level before plunging into details. Throughout the series I have tried to emphasize the variations which contain universal ideas and structures. Nevertheless, given the fact that fewer games are played with 1 c4 than 1 e4 or 1 d4, I have had the luxury of covering nearly all of its variations, as well as contributing much more up- to-date material and original analysis than in the previous two volumes. I hope that the latter proves useful on a practical level, as well as providing assistance with building a repertoire. Fortunately, although one should never pretend that a certain amount of memorization isn't essential to master any opening, the material in this book lends itself to a broader conceptual approach, and I have in- creased the role of verbal explanation accordingly. Taken as a whole, English Opening variations depend less upon tactical details than their king's and queen's pawn counterparts. I beg the reader's pardon for the dull repetition of assessments such as 'with equality', 'Black stands slightly better', and so forth. These inexact and ambiguous phrases are sadly necessary when presenting opening material with its necessarily truncated lines. There is nothing worse than consistently leaving the reader hanging with no conclusion, and yet it would only confuse matters to use a set of invented phrases to express finer distinctions. My compromise has been to provide verbal and/or analytical justifications whenever a position is significant enough to merit it, or when the assessment might be puzzling on the face of it. Regardless, you will have to put some effort into understanding the assessments and, hopefully, disagree with the inevitable set of mistaken ones. In that regard, almost all complex unattributed notes are my own. Incidentally, one convenient way to study this book is to find the main games in a large database. Then you can follow them in ChessBase (or a similar program) as you read. Having come this far, there's no getting around a Volume 4. Some of it will be devoted to a se- lection of the remaining chess openings; for example, the R€ti Opening (1 lLlf3) , various systems involving fianchettoes and f-pawn moves, as well as some gambits and so-called 'irregular open- ings'. A large portion of Volume 4, however, will be given to special topics such as choosing
10 MASTERING THE CHESS OPENINGS
openings, preparing openings, how to study openings, and broader discussions of practical issues facing the everyday player. My objective with this work is to provide instruction and analysis ranging from that appropriate for a low-rated developing player with, say, one or two years' experience, to a long-time player who is familiar with a good deal of theory. That is an ambitious goal, to be sure, and whether this volume fulfils it is a matter I leave for you to judge.
1 Introduction to the English Opening
1 c4 (D) is called the English Opening.
B
I first wrote about this opening three decades ago. Even then, it took me some 800 pages and four volumes to cover the relevant material, of- ten superficially. Since then, the theory and practice of the English has expanded to such a degree that previously minor lines provide ma- terial for lengthy articles, and major ones are almost unmanageable except on a conceptual basis. Professionals follow some theory up to and beyond the 20th move, just as in other openings. In addition, entirely new lines crop up on a regular basis. Fortunately, to a much greater extent than with 1 e4 or 1 d4, games in the English Opening tend to follow smoother contours as they de- velop, in that structures and strategies persist rather than dissolving into unstable imbalances or tactical melees. While there are many more independent subvariations to cover because the play is so fluid, it takes fewer games to become familiar with their properties. Let's start with the move 1 c4 and ask what White wants. His first goal is to control dS, ob- viously, and in particular, to discourage ... dS. In the most general terms, we can say that the move d4 is White's next objective. In other words, given a free move, White would ordi- narily play 2 d4; indeed, Black's main replies
1.. .eS and 1...cS are designed to prevent that.
This is analogous to the way in which, when White plays 1 e4, he is aiming for d4. Similarly, when he begins with 1 d4, he has in mind play- ing e4. Why, then, not play 1 d4 in the first place? To begin with, White might be disinclined to al- low 1 d4 dS; by playing 1 c4, he discourages l...d5?! 2 cxdS, which deprives Black of a cen- tre pawn and gains a tempo after 2 ... 'ilVxdS 3 ttJc3. Secondly, White may not want to expose himself to some of the annoyances that an early d4 brings; for example, a pin by 1 d4 ttJf6 2 c4 e6 3 ttJc3 Bb4 or a pawn confrontation by 1 d4 ttJf6 2 c4 cS. In contrast, after 1 c4 ttJf6, White can abstain from that kind of confrontation by 2 ttJc3 e6 3 e4 or 3 ttJf3 (see Chapter 11). Like- wise, after 1 d4 ttJf6 2 c4 g6 3 ttJc3 Bg7 4 e4, White has a broad centre to defend and Black's counterplay is usually directed against the d4- pawn (by ... eS or ... cS). By playing the English Opening, White has the opportunity to choose 1 c4 ttJf6 2 ttJc3 g6 3 g3 Bg7 4 Bg2 and then S e4 or S ttJf3, in both cases foregoing an early d4 and leaving his pawns less subject to direct at- tack (see Chapter 12). Naturally, this comes without the advantages of controlling d4 and eS that 1 d4 brings. Let's talk about Black's first move and some move-order issues associated with it. The pri- mary and overwhelmingly-played replies to 1 c4 are 1...eS, 1...cS and 1...ttJf6, as examined in the body of this book. I won't be discussing other replies except as they relate to remaining flank openings in Volume 4 (including ... b6 systems, ... g6 systems and .. .fS systems). Most importantly for the practical player, Black can make his first move with the intent of transpos- ing into other openings entirely. For example, he might respond to 1 c4 with 1...e6, intending to play 2 d4 dS with a Queen's Gambit De- clined. That order may suit White, however, who by using it has sidestepped a number of Queen's Gambit options such as (after 1 d4 dS 2
12 MASTERING THE CHESS OPENINGS
c4) 2 ... dxc4 (Queen's Gambit Accepted), 2 ... c6 with a Slav Defence, or 2 ... tDc6 with a Chigorin Defence. White can also play 1 c4 e6 2 tDf3, and upon 2 ... d5, he has entered a Reti Opening with- out having to face an early ... ~g4 or ... ~f5. The Reti is investigated in Volume 4. Also with a mind toward transpositions, Black might answer 1 c4 with 1.. .c6, aiming for the Slav Defence that would follow 2 d4 d5. That may well be satisfactory to White, or he can again choose 2 tDf3, meeting 2 ... d5 with 3 g3 or 3 b3, entering what is called a Reti Slav variation. These lines appear in detail in Volume 4. Another important idea after 1 c4 c6 is 2 e4. Formally speaking, that is a Caro-Kann Defence (beginning with 1 e4 c6 2 c4), and can be found in the books under that move-order. It can transpose, after 2 ... d5, to the Panov Attack following 3 exd5 cxd5 4 d4 (see Volume 1), or to a set of less frequently-played continua- tions; for example, 3 cxd5 cxd5 4 exd5 tDf6 5 ~a4+, a line that will be discussed in the next volume in the context of hybrid systems (along with 2 e4 e5). Naturally there are other trans- positional ideas, such as those stemming from l...d6, when 2 d4 tDf6 3 tDc3 g6 is a King's In- dian, while 2 tDc3 e5 is seen in Chapter 3 via 1 c4 e5 2 tDc3 d6. I was surprised to see that contemporary lit- erature on 1 c4 assigns such different weights to Black's main replies. Each of the three books that I would describe as primarily white reper- toire books allots far more space to the Re- versed Sicilian variations (1 c4 e5) than to the Symmetrical variations (1 c4 c5), ranging from 50% more pages to twice as many. This seemed odd to me, since 1 c4 c5 variations are played as often as 1 c4 e5, until I realized how many more variations a player is responsible for when play- ing either the white or black side of l...e5. In addition, looking over the range of the English Opening and trying to decide upon a distribu- tion of material, I found that there was a more coherent structure of positional types arising from 1...e5, which is important in an instruc- tional tome. As described in the next chapter, study of the English Opening with 1 c4 e5 serves double duty because of the insights that it gives into the Sicilian Defence, which be- gins 1 e4 c5; the latter, of course, is Black's most popular response to 1 e4. Apart from gaining a greater understanding of the charac- teristic structures common to both openings, we can learn a great deal about the advantages of having an extra move in chess; after all, White is playing the Sicilian Defence with an additional tempo. What may prove surprising to some is that there are various disadvantages of having an extra move. All of the chapters in the l...e5 section deal with this issue, Chapter 2 in the most fundamental manner possible. For all that, the incredibly rich history of the superficially less dynamic 1 c4 c5 variations demands close scrutiny. This is especially so because the extremely common move 1 tDf3 precludes 1.. .e5 and very often leads to a Sym- metrical English; for example, after 1 tDf3 c5 2 c4 or 1 tDf3 tDf6 2 c4 c5. Two recent non- repertoire books which cover only a limited se- lection of English Opening variations, chose to present more lines with 1 c4 c5 than with I c4 e5, probably because they were written with no overt agenda for either colour. As it turns out, the main lines after 1 c4 c5 are quite as exciting as those following 1 c4 e5. I have given less expansive coverage to the group of variations beginning with 1 c4 tDf6. The practical and theoretical material produced by these is only a fraction of that generated by l...e5 and l...c5, in part because the move l...tDf6 so frequently transposes to the Sym- metrical or Reversed Sicilian lines following an early ... c5 or ... e5. One policy of the first three volumes of this series has been to concentrate upon 'important' openings, and in particular those whose structures and tactical ideas over- lap as much as possible with other openings. Of the l...tDf6 lines, I decided that variations re- lated to ... e6 systems and ... g6 systems best fit the bill, and have chosen to investigate a num- ber of those. I should warn the reader from the outset that in the English Opening, transpositions and ques- tions of move-order abound, so much so that they will sometimes prove annoying to all but the most sophisticated of players. Working out and drawing attention to these myriad issues is also no fun for the author. But I would be remiss to ignore transpositions that have a significant practical effect. Understanding move-orders means no less than getting the position you want, instead of one you don't like or know
INTRODUCTION TO THE ENGLISH OPENING 13
nothing about. What is the point of studying and understanding openings if you can't get them on the board in the real world of play? Furthermore, knowing how to channel the game in the right direction can mean a tremendous advantage over your opponent in terms of time on the clock and energy expended. So, while you don't want to turn your study into drudgery, you should ab- sorb what you can of these move-order issues in a first reading, and then use this book as a reference when you find the need to sort things out later - for example, after playing a game. Finally I should say that in working through this volume, I found myself marvelling at the extent to which the English Opening embraces the many types of positions and structures that permeate chess practice in general. The term 'cross-pollination', which I describe in Volume 1, applies to the English Opening at least as much as to any other.
2 Reversing the Sicilian: 2nd Moves
Like other first moves, 1 c4 can evoke a sym- metrical response, in this case 1...c5, or a vari- ety of unbalancing replies that range from the highly committal to the very flexible. The un- wavering counter to 1 c4 is 1...e5 (D), establish- ing a direct and classical presence in the centre. w Not surprisingly, 1...e5 is the first move that occurs to players of little experience. But it turns out that masters also trust this naIve intu- ition and answer 1 c4 with 1.. .e5 as much as with any other move. Black's e-pawn advance has the same good points that 1 e4 does, that is, it fights for control of the centre while freeing his king's bishop and queen for development. By playing 1 ... e5, Black sets up a reversed Si- cilian Defence (l e4 c5), which has some pe- culiar implications. In the most basic sense, White's idea with 1 c4 is to control the central square d5 without letting his central pawns be- come targets. If you think about it, the Sicilian Defence is effective precisely because White has committed to 1 e4, i.e., White has presented Black with a target of attack, and he has fore- gone the chance to use his e-pawn in defence of d4. Given the enormous popularity of the Sicil- ian Defence (1 e4 c5), and in particular its repu- tation as a defence that creates Black's best winning chances, it may surprise you that so many top competitors (including most World Champions) have used 1 c4 e5 as Black, often exclusively. After all, any player of 1 e4 knows how difficult it is to generate chances in the Open Sicilian (i.e., those lines consisting of the moves 1 e4 c5 2 lDf3 followed by 3 d4 cxd4 4 lDxd4), without risking serious positional infe- riority. And they also know that when White avoids the Open Sicilian, even by using logical developing moves, Black still gets an opportu- nity to exert pressure upon White's position and create winning chances. He might do so by means of central control (for example, by play- ing ... lDc6, ... g6 and ... iLg7) combined with ei- ther queenside or central expansion. If there were a 'safe and solid' way to deny dynamic play to Black in the Sicilian, it would have changed the course of chess history. So you might ask (and many players have done so) why anyone would subject themselves to playing against the Sicilian Defence with a tempo less? It turns out that not only does 1 c4 e5 lead to a vast network of opening variations and diverse structures, it also provides a case study of the issues associated with reversed openings. This is a complicated subject only touched upon in the two previous volumes. If you understand the subtleties of reversed posi- tions, you will better appreciate the inherent imbalances in chess, and understand why Black can have so many positive winning chances in a game where the odds seem to be stacked against him. Naturally I've looked at this issue in other parts of the book, but it will be of prime impor- tance throughout the first few chapters. As it happens, many players intending to play an English Opening will use the move IlDf3, pri- marily to avoid lines with 1 c4 e5, and then fol- low with 2 c4. There are several basic reasons why Black can play the 'White' side of an opening a tempo down. The most important one has to do with the concept of 'information'. White gets an ex- tra move, to be sure, but Black has a look at that move and can thus adjust his strategy with the
REVERSING THE SICILIAN: 2ND MOVES 15
benefit of his extra information. In this sense, almost all of one's moves in chess come with the disadvantage oftipping one's hand. Natu- rally, the positive value of a move usually out- weighs this drawback, but the two factors can combine in unpredictable ways. Having an extra move in a reversed position can also put White in the odd situation that he has little positive to do. It turns out that many respectable openings for Black are essentially reactive, such that Black is waiting for White to make a committal move, perhaps an ambitious one, in order to get positive counterchances. When White takes on the reversed position, it is as though he is waiting for Black to do some- thing definite before he can respond with real effect. It may come as a surprise how often the tempo is of only moderate value to White. Finally, White sometimes feels that he should be playing for a win by virtue of moving first. But in a good number of chess openings, the best move for Black in a given position may lead to a dull equality without serious chances for either side. This might be acceptable for Black, but is not what White is looking for. Even defences generally thought of as dynamic when played as Black are sometimes revealed to be without bite when White tries to employ them with an extra move. Naturally, all of these advantages for Black in a reversed opening don't always compen- sate for the stark reality that White has an extra move. A tempo is, after all, a gain of time, and most practitioners of the English Opening en- joy taking up the challenge that 1...e5 implies. A skilful handler of the white pieces will often gain a comfortable advantage, simply because Black is not equipped to protect his centre at the same time as he wards off attacks in other sectors. Alternatively, White will sometimes achieve a typical Sicilian Defence advantage (for example, an advanced queenside attack) which might otherwise be impossible to achieve in the Sicilian itself. The variations arising from 1 c4 e5 are also more instructive than any others in the English Opening. Playing 1 c4 e5 is as basic to develop- ing chess skills as playing 1 e4 e5. In both cases, study and practice will increase your flu- ency in classical chess principles while dramat- ically improving your game. Working From the Ground Up White's most popular moves after 1 c4 e5 are 2 lLlc3 and 2 g3. Indeed, they account for a stag- gering 98% of all master games stemming from
1 c4 e5. In fact, if you factor in transpositions,
variations I assign to 2lLlc3 make up 94% of the total. In this chapter we look at why that is, and whether it should be so. Of course, one might say the same thing about other initial opening moves. For exam- ple, after 1 d4 d5, White pretty much sticks to 2 c4 or 2lLlf3. And 2lLlf3 really dominates play after 1 e4 e5. Still, 1 c4 e5 looks much more flexible, and superficially, at least six other moves seem reasonable, most of which are used in the reverse Sicilian position (following 1 e4 c5). Why then is 2 lLlc3 so overwhelmingly chosen and why is it practically automatic to play either 2 lLlc3 or 2 g3 ? The answer to this question can only be found by looking at other logical and consistent second moves for White. I'm going to do that in much more detail than standard books do be- cause White's second-move alternatives reveal much about what's going on in the Reversed Sicilian variations, particularly in terms of pawn-structures and associated strategies. Fur- thermore, we find that these alternatives have not been fully explored, so they may have a bit more practical value than has generally been thought. You will see that a knowledge of other openings is very useful in understanding these lines. 1 c4e5 (D) w
16 MASTERING THE CHESS OPENINGS
From this fundamental position, I shall look at the moves 2 d3 and 2lDf3 in their own sepa- rate sections. Before doing so, I think that we B can learn a lot by considering these rarely- played alternatives: a) 2 e4?! (D) may not be an out-and-out mistake, but it creates an outpost for Black on d4, one that is easily occupied. Unless White can get d4 in, his bishop on fl will be bad and his development will be cramped.
B
The most natural move is 2 ... lDc6, and if 3 lDf3 (in order to enforce d4), then 3 ... lDf6 4 lDc3 is a respectable line of the English Four Knights (Chapter 5) that goes 1 c4 e5 2 lDc3 lDf6 3 lDf3 lDc6 4 e4!? We shall see something about that position in Chapter 5. One important tactical theme in that case is that 4 ... .i.c5 can be met by 5 lDxe5!, with the idea 5 ... lDxe5 6 d4, forking two pieces and breaking Black's stran- glehold on the centre. Not surprisingly, that re- sults in a very unclear position. In the line we are currently considering, after 1 c4 e5 2 e4 lDc6 3lDf3, Black needn't bother with 3 ... lDf6, because he can clamp down further on d4 by 3 ... .i.c5!, and if 4 lDc3, 4 ... d6 prevents lDxe5 and has 5 .. .l Df6 or 5 .. .f5 in mind. Still better, Black can play 2 ... .i.c5(!) right away, to keep open the idea of ... c6, which would repel a knight from d5. Then 3 lDf3 can be answered by 3 ... d6, when a natural continua- tion is 4 d4?! exd4 5lDxd4 (D). White has gained some space but is slightly behind in development (it's Black's move), and his dark squares are vulnerable to attack. For example, Black has 5 ... ~f6!? (5 ... lDf6 6 lDc3 transposes to the next paragraph) 6lDf3 (after 6 .i.e3? lDc6 7 lDxc6 .i.xe3 8 fxe3 bxc6, White has a bad bishop and some very weak pawns) 6 ... ~g6!? 7 lDc3 lDf6 8 lDh4 ~g4 9 ~xg4 lDxg4 10 lDdllDc6 11 f3 lDge5 with the better development. To avoid trouble with ... ~f6, White can play 4lDc3 lDf6 and now 5 d4 exd4 6lDxd4. Then a natural sequence is 6 ... O-O 7 .i.e2 ':e8 8 f3lDc6 9 i.e3, which looks exactly like a King's Indian Defence, except that Black's bishop is on c5, where it went in one move, instead of g7! A standard idea from that opening is also good here: the move 9 ... lDh5! (D) intends ... lDf4 with ... ~g5, and in some cases ... f5. w A beautiful variation is 10 g3lDf4!!; for ex- ample, 11 gxf4 (11 lDxc6 lDg2+!) 11...lDxd4 12 .i.xd4 ~h4+ 13 'it'fl? (13 'iitd2 .i.xd4 fa- vours Black) 13 ... .i.h3+ 14 'iitgl ':e6 15 f5 .i.xf5! and so forth. And 10 lDxc6 can be met by 1O ... ~h4+! 11 g3? lDxg3, etc. In conclusion, it's not as though 2 e410ses by force, but there's no effective way for White to

contest the outpost on d4 without falling dan- gerously behind in development. That is proba- bly obvious to most readers; nevertheless, the B details are instructive. b) 2 e3 is an acceptable move, imitating the Sicilian Defence with 1 e4 cS 2 liJf3 e6, but it commits White to a particular central pawn- formation early on, thus giving Black useful in- formation. Black can continue, for example, 2 ... liJf6 (D). w Then Black will have no complaints if White tries 3 d4!?, because 3 ... exd4 4 exd4 dS gives him a full share of the centre. After 2 e3 liJf6, the more flexible 3 liJc3 will be seen under the move-order 1 c4 eS 2 liJc3 liJf6 3 e3 in the first game of Chapter 4 (Van Wely-Kasparov). I should point out that 3 a3!? tries to transpose into a reversed Paulsen Sicilian after 3 ... dS 4 cxdS liJxdS, but Black needn't be so coopera- tive and, for example, the move a3 isn't terribly useful in lines beginning with 3 ... c6, or against a King's Indian structure following 3 ... d6 4 d4 liJbd7 S liJc3 g6 6 liJf3 i.g7, etc. Compare the alternative 2 a3 below. After 1 c4 eS 2 e3, 2 ... c6 can also be played; for example, 3 d4 exd4 4 ~xd4 (4 exd4 dS is fine for Black) 4 ... dS S liJf3 liJf6 6 liJc3 (D), when we have a reversed variation of the Ala- pin Sicilian (1 e4 cS 2 c3). When the queen is on d4, we find that varia- tions with the move e3 are less pointed than those in which White has played i.gS (the rele- vant comparison is with the reversed line in the Sicilian Defence, 1 e4 cS 2 c3 dS 3 exdS ~xdS 4 d4liJf6 sliJf3 e6, which is rather unambitious in comparison with S. .. i.g4). Of course, White has an extra tempo here and there will be plenty of chances to make such an unbalanced posi- tion interesting. Incidentally, the frequent rela- tionship between seemingly disparate openings is shown by the following Slav Defence varia- tion: 1 d4 dS 2 c4 c6 3liJc3 eS (this is called the Winawer Counter-Gambit) 4 e3 exd4 S ~xd4 liJf6 6 liJf3, with precisely the position we are discussing! c) 2 a3 is one of those semi-waiting moves that doesn't commit to a strategy, but has some point. It prepares a timely b4, for one thing. Think about it: after 1 e4 cS 2liJf3 followed by
3 d4 cxd4 4liJxd4, it's hard to find a variation in
which ... a6 isn't useful for Black. The problem is that, again, Black needn't co- operate with an early ... dS. Thus, for example, 2 ... liJf6 (D) (also fine are 2 ... g6 and 2 ... d6, among other moves). w 3liJc3 (3 b4 isn't very pointed when there's no black knight on c6 to kick around; an exam- ple would be 3 ... g6 4 i.b2 d6 S e3 i.g7 6liJc3

O-O with equality) 3 ... c6!? (Black might play this way in order to stir the pot; a simpler solu- tion is 3 ... g6 followed by a King's Indian set- up with ... d6, ... i.g7 and ... O-O) 4 d4 (4 ttJf3 is met by 4 ... e4 5 ttJd4 d5 6 cxd5 cxd5 {or even 6 .. :i!i'xd5}, when a3 isn't helping matters; Black can also answer with 4 ... d6, when the move a3 is again fairly meaningless) 4 ... exd4 5 ~xd4 d5
(D).
w Now we have a position very similar to that arising from 2 e3 c6 3 d4 exd4 4 ~xd4 d5 above, except that White has the opportunity to play the desirable move i.g5, since the bishop isn't cut off by a pawn on e3. Unfortunately, he has invested time on the unimpressive move a3, and he has a knight on c3 which isn't as well- placed as one on f3. Within the next few moves, Black threatens to gain space a tempo by means of ... c5 and ... d4. With that in mind, White might continue 6 ttJf3 (6 cxd5 cxd5 frees a square for Black's knight on c6, which will at- tack White's queen with gain of time; naturally that's not the end of the world for White, but it means that he is very unlikely to get anything out of the opening; furthermore, the immedi- ate 6 i.g5 can be answered by 6 ... i.e7, threat- ening ... c5, when 7 cxd5 cxd5 8 i.xf6 i.xf6 9 'ili'xd5?? loses to 9 ... i.xc3+) 6 ... i.e7 7 g3?! (or 7 cxd5 cxd5 8 e3 ttJc6) 7 ... c5 8 'iVd3 d4. You might compare this with I c4 e5 2 g3 ttJf6 3 i.g2 c6 4 d4 exd4 5 'iVxd4 d5 6 ttJf3 in Chapter 4; in that case, White can abstain from capture on d5 in some lines until the right moment. And even if White does exchange on d5, then after ... ttJc6 he can move his queen without having to suffer a direct attack from ... d4. If all that sounds obscure, a look at the variations in Chap- ter 4 will help. I should also note that Black can take his chances with an early ... d5; for example, 3 ... d5, even if that seems cooperative. We shall see lines with ... d5 below, and in future chapters. d) 2 b3 is perfectly good, but it lacks punch. White can, for example, combine it with g3 and i.g2 (a double fianchetto), to get a game with mutual chances. But when the king's bishop has to settle for a place on e2, it's highly unlikely that White will get any real prospects. Accord- ing to theory, one easy solution is 2 ... ttJf6 3 i.b2 ttJc6 (D). w
4 e3 (4 ttJf3 e4 5 ttJd4 i.c5 6 e3 O-O is equal;
Black can even play 6 ... i.xd4 7 exd4 d5, in spite of ceding the bishop-pair, since White's bishop on b2 is ineffective and his d4-pawn re- quires tending) 4 ... d5 5 cxd5 ttJxd5 poses White at least as many problems as Black. For exam- ple, 6 i.b5?! ttJdb4! is not pleasant, because of the attack on the d3-square. Of course, Black has many other replies to 2 b3. e) Finally, you may be wondering about the direct 1 c4 e5 2 d4?!. Then 2 ... exd4 3 'ili'xd4?! ttJc6 develops smoothly with gain of time. A trickier move is 3 ttJf3!?, when Black can play simply 3 ... ttJf6! (White's only real point is that he can meet 3 ... c5?! by 4 e3! dxe3 5 i.xe3; then, for the pawn, White has complete control of d5 and the d-file, and his pieces are coming out rapidly - this is a type of position worth re- membering, and parallels a similar gambit in the Sicilian Defence) 4 ttJxd4 d5!? (an ambi- tious freeing move; simple moves like 4 ... i.c5 should also equalize) 5 cxd5 'ili'xd5 6 ttJc3 (6 e3

(7 a3? i.xc3+ 8 bxc3 O-O gives White B two bishops at the cost of development and the assumption of weaknesses; compare, for exam- ple, the Chigorin Queen's Gambit in Volume 2) 7 ... tbc6 with the idea 8 tbxc6 (8 ~xb4 'iixd4!) 8 ... i.xc3+ 9 bxc3 i.d7! and Black probably even has the better game. Najdorf and Dragon Aspirations
1 c4 e5
For those who like the Najdorf or Dragon variations of the Sicilian Defence, which both begin with 1 e4 c5 2 tbf3 d6, it's only natural to consider the move ...
2 d3 (D)
B
Why isn't this played more often? The main problem, as opposed to 2 tbc3 and 2 g3, is that 2 d3 forfeits the chance to play d4 in one move. Let's see what that implies for both sides. 2 ... tbf6 a) Another logical move for Black is 2 ... tbc6, which is not quite as flexible in the sense that he relinquishes the option of ... c6. But it is flexible in another way if he intends ... g6 and ... i.g7, because in that case Black retains the options of playing ... tbge7 and/or ... f5 at some point. The Dragon or Najdorffan will most likely respond with 3 tbf3 (D). Then Black can highlight the drawbacks of 2 d3 by playing 3 ... g6 (alternatively, 3 ... tbf6 4 tbc3 is a main-line Four Knights Variation of Chapter 5, with White having played the rela- tively harmless 4 d3; see below). The best an- swer to an early ... g6 is often d4, but here 4 d4!? is a loss of a tempo, which means that Black will equalize easily. Play might go 4 ... exd4 5 tbxd4 i.g7 6 tbxc6 bxc6 and Black has free and easy play, a natural continuation being 7 g3 tbe7 8 i.g2 O-O 9 O-O d5, or 9 .. ..l:1b8. Take away d3 and ... tbc6 and we can see why such an early ... g6 can be risky: 1 c4 e5 2 tbc3 g6?! 3 d4! exd4 4 'iixd4, and now 4 ... tbf6? is disastrous due to 5 i.g5 with tbd5 next, winning a piece. White's best line, instead of 4 d4, is probably 4 tbc3 i.g7 5 g3, which is a kind of reversed Closed Sicilian (or 'Closed English') that we shall run into in Chapter 6. b) In a more original vein, notice how 2 ... c6, another Alapin Sicilian reversed, is perfectly playable for Black. In large part this is because Black hasn't committed his king's knight; for example, 3 tbf3 d6 4 tbc3 f5! (D) is a familiar kind of position except that White would like to have the move d4 in. This should be compared with a line that arises in Chapter 3: 1 c4 e5 2 tbc3 d6 3 tbf3 f5 4 d4 e4 5 tbg5 c6. In the diagram, White can only play d4 with loss of time. If he doesn't chal- lenge the centre, Black has few problems; for example, a logical continuation is 5 g3 tbf6 6 i.g2 i.e7 (there are other moves, but I'll show this for simplicity's sake) 7 0-00-08 l:tbl a5 9 a3 tba6 10 b4 axb4 11 axb4 tbc7 12 b5 i.d7 with a safe queenside and a nice central posi- tion. White could insist upon playing 5 d4!? a tempo down, when a sample line that parallels
20 MASTERING THE CHESS OPENINGS
w the Chapter 3 variation is S ... e4 6 lDgS h6 (Black assumes some weaknesses, as White wants, but with a gain of time and space) 7lDh3 gS 8 e3 lDf6 9 .te2 fIIe7 (in order to be able to answer 10 .thS+ with 1O ... lDxhS 11 fIIxhS+ Win) 10 O-O .tg7 11 b4 O-O with equality. Watch out for 12 .tb2? (12 ~hl! is better) 12 .. .f4! (D). w Black intends .. .f3, winning a piece. And he has the idea 13 exf4 g4, when the knight is trapped! Also losing is 13 f3 exf3 14 .txf3 g4. You should know this attacking theme, which comes up in periodically in a variety of open- ings. Very often the 'victim' of the tactic has fianchettoed; for example, in the Pirc Defence when Black answers eS with ... lDg4 and is chased back to h6 by h3; subsequently, White plays g4 and, with a great deal of luck, gets to use the fS trick. You may want to check out that opening to see what I'm talking about. Granted, all this is not very meaningful in terms of precise chess theory. Nevertheless, some useful ideas arise when we consider such lines. We now return to 2 ... lDf6 (D); w 3lDf3 With this move White is still hoping for a Najdorf or Dragon with reversed colours (e.g. 3 ... lDc6 and now 4 a3 dS or 4 g3 dS). The alter- native 3 lDc3 can be met by various moves, in- cluding the simple 3. .. lDc6, when 4 lDf3 is analysed in Chapter S under the move-order 2 lDc3lDf6 3 lDf3 lDc6 4 d3. If White chooses to play 4 g3, Black has new possibilities. The move 4 ... .tb4, for example, should lead to an equal game, even though someone wishing to get away from the beaten path as White might want to play S .td2 followed by a3 or lDdS and take it from there. Perhaps the most interesting comparison with a normal Sicilian Dragon is in the line 3 lDc3 lDc6 4 g3 dS S cxdS lDxdS. White's 'extra' tempo is d3 which, as so often, is committal in a partially detrimental way. That's because after 6 .tg2 .te6, Black can keep his knight on the desirable square dS. To explain that, let's con- tinue with the normal Dragon moves 7 lDf3 .te7 (D). Experienced English Opening players can compare 1 c4 eS 2lDc3 lDf6 3 lDf3 lDc6 4 g3 dS S cxdS lDxdS 6 .tg2 in Chapter S. In that case, White is threatening 7 lDxeS!, so Black usually plays 6 ... lDb6, because after 6 ... .te6 7 O-O, White is ready to play the advantageous move 8 d4. By contrast, in our present example, White has already committed to d3; this means that he can only advance the d-pawn to d4 at the cost of a tempo. This is a rather sophisticated point,
REVERSING THE SICILIAN: 2ND MOVES 21
w especially for those who don't play the Dragon; however, it's illustrative of the nuances that arise in reversed openings. Black can also play something solid versus 3 tbc3 such as 3 ... c6 4 tbf3 d6, after which he can choose either ... g6/ ... i.g7 with a standard posi- tion, or ... tbbd7, holding out for possibilities of ... d5 or ... g6. Instead, 4 ... d5? 5 cxd5 gives White the advantage, because 5 ... cxd5? loses a pawn to 6 tbxe5 d4 7 ~a4+!, and 5 ... tbxd5 6 tbxe5! tbxc3 7 bxc3 ~a5 8 tbf3 ~xc3+ 9 i.d2 favours White due to his better development and central pawn-majority. But watch out for the standard trap 5 tbxe5?? d4, winning a piece, because if the c3-knight moves, 6 .. :iVa5+ will win the knight on e5! A handy trick to know. We now return to 3 tbf3 (D):
B
3 ... tbc6 After 3. .. i.b4+!? 4 i.d2 i.xd2+ 5 'it'xd2, we have a type of Moscow Sicilian reversed (1 e4 c5 2 tbf3 d6 3 i.b5+, etc.); Black stands solidly enough if he continues 5 ... d6. As previously indicated, what are equalizing lines when play- ing Black in the Sicilian Defence are often less attractive for White in the English Opening, since he expects to retain an advantage. The question is always whether his extra tempo has real significance. In this particular case, White has enough interesting options that the reversed Moscow Variation may be satisfactory for him, regardless of whether equality is the technical verdict. 4a3 A typical Sicilian Defence move. Again, White hopes for 4 ... d5 5 cxd5 tbxd5 with a re- versed Najdorf and a tempo in hand. Black will usually not oblige, but see the next note. The 'Dragon-esque' 4 g3 allows moves such as 4 ... g6 (again because d410ses a tempo), or 4 ... i.c5, or 4 ... i.b4+. We shall also see that re- versed Dragon positions following 4 ... d5 5 cxd5 tbxd5 are satisfactory for Black. Finally, 4 tbc3 is a line of the Four Knights Variation, considered relatively harmless, which is not to say that White can't try it out. Black might have avoided this by 2 d3 tbc6 3 tbf3 g6, al- though that's hardly necessary. 4 ... g6 Solid play. Fianchettoing the king's bishop tends to be a reliable equalizer if White plays slow moves. Still, it's instructive to see what happens if Black cooperates by playing the provocative 4 ... d5!? 5 cxd5 tbxd5 (D). w If there's any position involving 2 d3 in which White should be able to exploit an extra tempo, it would be this one. Now the move from the Najdorf 'proper' is 6 e4 (6 g3 is a reversed
22 MASTERING THE CHESS OPENINGS
Dragon structure in which a3 may not help much; 6 e3 is a reversed Scheveningen, likely to provide interesting but not inspiring play if Black responds ultra-solidly; 6 b4! is more am- bitious, when the game can go in many direc- tions, but White does well to put his knight on d2 and not c3, just as Black chooses ... lLlbd7 in the great majority of Najdorf variations) 6 ... lLlb6!? (this is normal in the reversed position, but 6 ... lLlf6 maybe be a safer course; you need to study the theory of the Najdorf to understand this line) 7 .lie3 (D) (7 .lie2 and 7 lLlbd2 are also logical moves, when b4 and .lib2 frequently follows).
B
After 7 .lie3, White is a tempo up in a re- versed Najdorf Sicilian. Nothing that he has done has tipped his hand in a negative way, so the real issue is whether Black has a modest way to avoid entering into the time-critical dy- namic lines which characterize the Najdorf. For this purpose, the careful 7 ... .lie7 is appropriate (rather than the energetic 7 ... f6 8 lLlbd2 .lie6 9 .lie2 ~d7 10 O-O O-O-O 11 b4, when White is a tempo ahead of the 'English Attack' of the Si- cilian Defence; that is a line characterized by dynamism and attacking ideas, so an extra move will be very important and therefore 7 .. .f6 is not a smart choice for Black). After 7 ... .lie7, we might see 8 .lie2 (8 d4 exd4 9 lLlxd4 lLlxd4 leads to the kind of simplification with which Black can be content when playing the Sicilian; of course, White wants more in the reversed position) 8 ... O-O 9 O-O .lie6 10 lLlbd2 as and Black's game is solid enough. Naturally, there are options here for both sides, as well as issues of move-order that I haven't mentioned. You can see that the play stemming from 4 a3 dS is flexible and balanced. White may like this idea of a reversed Najdorf, but he needs to keep in mind that few players of Black will do their opponents the psychological favour of playing 4 ... dS. Let's follow a game with our main-line move, 4 ... g6: w Wahls - Rabiega German Ch, Altenkirchen 2001

REVERSING THE SICILIAN: 2ND MOVES 23
A fairly typical English Opening position has arisen, in the sense that White is exerting pres- sure with his g2-bishop along the long diagonal, and that he has reinforced his light-square con- trol by means of b4-bS. Black, in tum, is set to attack, either on the kingside by ... fS or in the centre by ... dS (often preceded by ... c6). In gen- eral, White has two related ideas that have been hampered (or delayed) by the insertion of a3. Normally he gets his best attacking chances by playing the move cS, at some point capturing on d6 and opening lines on the queenside. To im- plement this, however, White would ideally have the moves a4 and i.a3 in, and in the situation be- fore us, they both take two moves to implement instead of one. That's quite a loss of time, and guarantees Black reasonable chances regard- less of whether he plays on the kingside or in the centre. Another of White's customary strategies is a4-aS-a6; again, playing a3-a4 would lose a tempo in carrying out this plan. 9 ... a6 Black makes a tough decision that you will confront time and again in the English Open- ing, and in this book. If he opens the a-file and exchanges the aI-rook, that can either make it easier to defend his queenside (one less pawn there) or else help White to penetrate favour- ably down the a-file. Generally this is a matter of judgement, and the consequences are not im- mediately evident.

14 ••• ttJd7 A move characteristic of such positions: by doubly protecting the eS-pawn, Black prepares a possible ... dS, and his f-pawn is also freed to advance. The knight on d7 can also be well- placed for defence if it gets to cS. 15 ttJc3 'Wic7 IS ... dS and IS ... fS are decent alternatives. 16 ttJd2 White wants to strengthen his control of the hl-a8 diagonal. 16 'iWc2 also makes sense, in order to bring the fl-rook to the queenside. 16• •• ttJc5 Or 16 ... fS, when Black's mobile centre serves as a counterweight to White's queenside pres- sure. 17 ttJa4 ttJxa4 18 'Wixa4 i.g4?

White could have played 19 cS!, when the queen on a4 attacks the g4-bishop, giving White time to play cxd6 and seriously weaken Black's pawn-structure. Sometimes the simple moves are the easiest to miss. The rest of the game was not of interest in terms of opening ideas. Improved Alekhine-Sicilian
1 c4 e5 2 ttJf3 (D)

By playing 2 ttJf3, White enters into an Ale- khine Defence (1 e4 ttJf6) with the extra move c4 in. The move 2 ttJf3 is also a reversed form of the Nimzowitsch Sicilian, which goes 1 e4 cS 2 ttJf3 ttJf6. Looked at from that perspective,
24 MASTERING THE CHESS OPENINGS
White has an extra tempo, that is, Black hasn't played ... liJf6 yet. Can White get an advantage in this way? While 2 liJf3 is hardly a super- weapon, I think that it is better than generally recognized, both as an independent variation and a transpositional tool. 2• •• e4 This aggressive move is easily the most im- portant one. Instead, 2 ... d6 is rather passive af- ter 3 d4. The alternative 2 ... liJc6 is a sound choice, aiming for transposition. Then White can play 3 liJc3, returning to a main line of the English Opening which goes 2 liJc3 liJc6 3 liJf3, while having eliminated a couple of pos- sibilities for Black. For example, had White played I c4 eS 2 liJc3, Black's intent may have been 2 ... d6, a popular move that can transpose into the King's Indian set-up after ... g6, but can also involve a sequence such as 3 liJf3 fS 4 d4 e4, which has a decent reputation for Black (see Chapter 3). Or Black might have prepared 2 liJc3 ..tb4, a move which has been approved of at the highest levels of play (this is also ana- lysed in Chapter 3). Since these options aren't available to Black after 2 liJf3 liJc6 3 liJc3, he will probably settle for the main lines, namely, 3 ... liJf6, or 3 .. .fS, which are analysed in Chap- ters S and 6 respectively. Alternatively, White can deviate by playing 3 d4, intending 3 ... exd4 4 liJxd4 liJf6 S liJc3, transposing to the 4 d4 variation of the Four Knights main line, which goes 2 liJc3 liJf6 3 liJf3 liJc6 4 d4 (see Chapter S). By this means, White would bypass one of Black's important options, 4 ... e4. After 3 d4, however, the immediate 3 ... e4! (D) is the truly independent continuation. w Then White should abstain from 4 liJgS?! (remarkably, this is already dubious; the inno- cent-looking 4 liJfd2 can be met with 4 ... e3!? S fxe3 liJf6, an apparently sound gambit that is unclear, but at least interesting for both sides; White can also consider 4 liJeS) 4 ... ..tb4+! S liJc3 (S i.d2?? 'iixgS) and Black can exploit the very lack of ... liJf6 to play the unique S. .. dS! (intending ... h6) 6 cxdS 'iixdS 7 a3 (pretty much forced in order to defend d4 without losing the knight on gS) 7 ... ..txc3+ 8 bxc3 liJf6 with excel- lent central control, very quick development, and the prospect of ... h6. This is not so different from other lines we shall see in this book that emphasize space and light-square control by Black. Players familiar with the Chigorin Queen's Gambit will see that Black very likely stands better than after I d4 dS 2 c4 liJc6 3 cxdS 'iixdS 4 e3 eS S liJc3 ..tb4 6 a3 ..txc3+ 7 bxc3 liJf6 8 liJf3 e4, a position which is itself quite playable for Black. One point of knowing a variety of openings is to be able to make such comparisons and therefore intuitive assessments about a position's worth. 3 liJd4 Who wouldn't want this type of reversed Alekhine Defence (1 e4 liJf6 2 eS liJdS), having the move ... cS already in? That would discour- age White from d4, which is his main move ver- sus the Alekhine. Of course, it's never that simple. Let's follow some games: Murey - Heran Condom 2004

This solution is approved by the conven- tional wisdom; in fact, 3 ... lLlc6 is often adorned by'!'. Black forestalls White's planned attack on the exposed e-pawn and compels a response. 4e3 White continues to follow the main idea from the Sicilian Defence (l e4 c5 2lLlf3lLlf6 3 e5 lLld5 4 lLlc3 e6). 4 lLlc2!? appears passive, but White plans to harass Black's e-pawn by means of lLlc3, g3 and i.g2, with lLle3 and sometimes d3 to follow.

Here, by analogy with the reversed position from the Sicilian Defence, Black would a1ready have a knight on f6. If he catches up with that position now, White will be glad to break up the centre; for example, 5 ... lLlf6 6lLlc3 d5!? 7 d3! exd3 (7 ... i.b4?? 8 'Wia4+; 7 ... i.f5 8 i.g5) 8 i.xd3 dxc4 9 i.xc4 with a pleasant isolated queen's pawn position which may favour White and is at any rate easier to play for him (O-O, l:tel and i.g5 are typical follow-up moves). However, precisely because Black is a tempo behind the Nimzowitsch Sicilian line (that is, because ... lLlf6 hasn't been played), he can oc- cupy that square, as follows: 5 •• JWf6! This simple move hits d4, which can be hard to defend. This is essentia1ly the reason why 2 lLlf3 is so seldom played. We have the typica1 case where playing with a tempo less has its ad- vantages, because f6 is free. The issue remains whether that benefit outweighs, or is outweighed by, the value of an extra move. 6d5?! Usually this is the only move given by play- ers and theoreticians. But since it turns out to be extremely perilous, White might look to con- test the initiative by 6 lLlc3!, giving up a pawn

This delays the break d3 until White's king is out of the way. White intends to exploit Black's poor development, but he wants to get his pieces out before playing to win the centre and evict the queen. The prospect of ltJbS or ltJdS can be bothersome for Black. The only other source that I know of that mentions 6ltJc3 recommends 7 d3, which can be met by 7 ... .Jtb4; for example, 8 'iVb3 .Jtxc3+ 9 bxc3 'iVeS (or 9 ... 'iVd6). Then White controls the dark squares, yet needs to prove compensation for the pawn (which is not to say that it is lacking). Mter 7 .Jte2, the game might proceed 7 ... ltJf6
8 O-O, and now Black has to decide what to do
about the centre, as well as keep an eye on pos- sibilities like ltJbS and d4. A sample line might be 8 ... .Jtb4 (8 ... dS 9 d3 activates White's pieces, one point being 9 ... exd3 10 ltJbS!

3 Introduction to 2 tDc3:
Black Plays Flexibly
1 c4 e5 2 ttJc3 (D)
B
Having looked at some other moves in the last chapter, you can see how 2 ttJc3 might be favoured. It controls the key squares e4 and d5, yet doesn't commit White to a central pawn- structure. For example, 2 ttJc3 leaves open the possibilities of playing d3, d4, e3 and e4, which is not the case with 2 d3 and 2 e3 (at least not in one move). Nor does it create a hole (as does 2 e4), or allow for an answer which renders it slow or irrelevant (for example, 2 a3 lets Black use a ... g6 solution, and most of the moves we considered in the last chapter were vulnerable to 2 ... c6). After 2 ttJc3, Black's traditional main lines begin with 2 ... ttJf6 and 2 ... ttJc6. But masters and grandmasters are very fond of some other replies, especially 2 ... d6 and 2 ... i.b4, ultra- flexible moves which have been proven to give good counterplay. The assorted variations stem- ming from them contain an astonishing number of themes and ideas which are common to the rest of the English Opening. Furthermore, the elastic nature of 2 ... d6 and 2 ... i.b4 allows Black to have an equal say in the pawn-formations that result out of the opening, something he may not be able to do in variations growing out of 2 ... ttJf6 and 2 ... ttJc6. At the same time, White has exceptional leeway in picking his own way through the opening. Some would say this is chess as it should be. Before turning to those moves, let's continue to pursue the philosophy that less frequently played alternatives can be as instructive as the normal ones. I think that a glance at rare and even inferior moves will help us understand what White wants from these positions, and what it is that Black should avoid. Following these moves I shall take a fairly close look at 2 ... f5, a periodically-played move which is use- ful to understand because of the typical struc- tures that it leads to. a) 2 ... b6?! doesn't go well with ... e5 (better with ... e6, to add to the bishop's influence along the long diagonal). 3 ttJf3 is the simplest reply: 3 ... ttJc6 (3 ... d6?! 4 d4 exd4 5 ttJxd4 gives White space and superior development while weaken- ing Black's light squares to boot) 4 e3 with d4 next is an excellent course for White. Naturally
4 g3 is also good, if unassuming.
b) 2 ... c6 (D), which is perfectly fine after 2 d3, 2 e3 and 2 a3, gives White two good re- sponses. w
30 MASTERING THE CHESS OPENINGS
First, according to the ideas discussed in the first two volumes, the move ... c6 should be a red flag for 3 d4, since a queen on d4 cannot be attacked by a knight on c6. Thus, should Black play 3 ... exd4 4 'iWxd4, he ends up short of space; e.g., 4 ... l2Jf6 (Black achieves nothing after 4 ... l2Ja6 S e4l2Jb4 6 'iWdl and 7 a3; 4 ... 'iWf6 may be best, although even the exchange of queens by S l2Jf3 'ii'xd4 6 l2Jxd4 is awkward for Black because of his weakness down the d-file and White's greater command of territory) S e4 d6 6 iLf4 followed by O-O-O, when the pawn on d6 has to be tended to. Instead of 3 ... exd4, 3 ... dS! may be best. Per- haps you remember the line 1 d4 dS 2 c4 c6 3 l2Jc3 eS from Volume 2, the so-called Winawer Counter-Gambit (and also mentioned on page 17 of this volume). By strange means, we've transposed to it! I believe that White gets some advantage here; theory also leans that way, but isn't definite on the point. Finally, the most obvious move after 2 l2Jc3 c6 is 3 l2Jf3. There follows 3 ... d6 (the alterna- tives are uninspiring) 4 d4, when Black does best to go for a type of Old Indian Defence by 4 ... l2Jd7 S e4 l2Jgf6. That position is of course playable, but White is generally thought to stand better with his space advantage. c) 2 ... g6 runs into a similar problem: 3 d4! exd4?! (3 ... d6 4l2Jf3l2Jd7, but again, not every- one wants to playa set-up with so little space) 4 'ii'xd4 'ii'f6 (best, in view of 4 ... l2Jf6?? S iLgS and l2JdS, winning) S 'iWe3+! (D) (this may be the best of many moves that have been played here).

S ... 'iWe6 (S .. :iVe7 6l2JdS transposes; after any other move, 6 l2JdS is too strong, the best try being S ... 'iti'd8!? 6 l2JdS 'ii'g7 7 iLd2! l2Je7 8 iLc3l2JxdS 9 cxdS f6 10 'ii'd4 i.e7 11 e4, etc.) 6 l2JdS 'ii'xe3 (but 6 ... l2Ja6 7 ~d4 f6 8 l2Jf3 c6 9 l2Jf4 is very pleasant for White) 7 iLxe3l2Ja6 8 iLd4! f6 9 O-O-O 'iti'f7 10 l2Jf3 c6 11 l2Jf4 with a clear advantage for White. Now let's move on to some more important answers to 2l2Jc3. Advancing the f-Pawn
1 c4 e5 2l2Jc3 f5 (D)
w In many variations that stem from 1...eS, Black can contest the centre and grab space with the move ... fS. Generally, Black would like to maintain his e- and f-pawns on the 4th rank for a while, building up with moves like ... l2Jf6, ... d6, and perhaps ... g6, ... i.g7 with ... l2Jc6 or ... c6; we'll see that in several lines. The immediate 2 ... fS has been played by some strong players, but it requires that Black shift strategies if White makes a direct challenge. 3d4! This seems to lose a tempo after 3 ... exd4 and ... l2Jc6, but note that Black's .. .fS is a non- developing move. In addition, advancing the f- pawn creates weaknesses, with the result that Black's control of e4 comes at the cost of a cer- tain looseness. Compare 2 ... d6 3 d4!? exd4 4 'ii'xd4 l2Jc6 below.
3 e3 followed by d4 is less pointed but reason-
ably effective. This may afford White a small advantage (although that's not clear), simply because Black has to respond to d4-dS. The

After 3 d4, we'll look at two game excerpts expressing different philosophies by Black: w Duczynski - R. Novak Czech Team Ch 1995 3 ... e4 (D) This is a standard pawn-structure, but nor- mally Black's e-pawn advance either comes with tempo (attacking a knight on f3) or when White's c1-bishop is shut in by a pawn on e3. Here White has a number of good moves (such as 4 ttJh3), two of which directly exploit Black's slightly overextended pawn-structure. 4g4!? White plays the most radical (and fun) move, undermining Black's structure immediately. 4 f3 is also promising, because 4 ... exf3 surrenders the centre; White can choose between 5 ttJxf3 and 5 exf3, having in mind i.d3, ttJge2, etc. Nor does 4 ... ttJf6 5 i.g5! look desirable for Black. Maybe 4 ... i.b4 is best, when 5 ttJh3! introduces the idea of i.g5, as well as planning ttJf4. 4 ... fxg4 Upon 4 ... g6 5 gxf5 gxf5 6 ttJh3!, f4 becomes a pure outpost for occupation by White's knight or other pieces; he is better developed and can easily exploit the g-file and Black's weak king- side squares. 5 i.g2 ttJf6 6 i.g5! i.e77 e3 d6 (D) w 8 h3! gxh3 8 ... g3, preventing the opening of the h-file, is often the way to cut down White's attack in such positions.

White has a winning advantage.

It wasn't that long ago (relative to the history of the English Opening) that 2 ... ~b4 would w have been looked upon as a questionable if not downright weak way for Black to respond to 2 ltJc3. True, the move ... ~b4 is at least an option at some point in many main lines of the 1 c4 eS English, but not before a black knight is devel- oped, and not when the bishop can immedi- ately be attacked by ltJdS! But in the 1990s, the world's elite grandmasters began to play 2 ... ~b4 on a regular basis, such that it became one of the most popular variations of the Eng- lish Opening at the top ranks. Today 2 ... ~b4 is alive and well among grandmasters, and is a line that has to be coped with by most 1 c4 players (those who play 1 c4 eS 2 g3 notably excepted). Clearly, one of Black's plans is to play ... ~xc3, doubling White's pawns. This idea is seen in future chapters after 2 ... ltJf6; for in- stance, 3 g3 .i.b4 or 3 ltJf3 ltJc6 4 g3 (or 4 e3 .i.b4) 4 ... iLb4. Why is Black bypassing 2 ... ltJf6? In a word: flexibility. With a knight on f6, Black can't expand on the kingside by ... fS. Nor can he follow the often-desirable move ... e4 with ... fS, supporting the advanced pawn. Black might want to place the knight on e7, and there are other considerations. For example, in cases where White plays ltJdS and Black responds with ... c6, the advanced knight doesn't have the option of ltJxf6 and will often have to retreat. Looking on the bright side for White, 2 ... ~b4 is a committal move that gives him the opportu- nity to set up pawn-structures that he normally won't be able to. Furthermore, while the obvi- ous 3 ltJdS may eventually lose time, for the moment it attacks the bishop and paves the way for an early d4. A study of 2 ltJc3 iLb4 is extremely useful for the practical player. It can lead to positions

whose basic pawn-structures and themes are not only the same as in many other English Opening variations, but also very close to what we find in the Nimzo-Indian, Bogo-Indian, and even the King's Indian! Let's look at a series of games to get a feel for what can happen in this rich variation, and as a consequence, what can happen in the main lines of the 1 c4 e5 English. Before investigat- ing the main line with 3 lLld5, we'll look at games with a couple of moderately out-of- favour (although sound) moves, in order to clarify what the main issues are. I should mention that the natural 3 g3 will often transpose to other lines. For instance, 3 ... lLlf6 is the main-line variation 2lLlc3lLlf6 3 g3 iLb4, which is an attractive choice; see Chap- ter 4. Black can also go his own way; for exam- ple, 3 ... iLxc3 4 bxc3 d6 5 iLg2 f5!? when in Hodgson-Psakhis, Metz 1994, White tried the exotic 6 c5!? dxc5 (6 ... d5! seems safe enough, and Bf7lLlf3, 7 ... lLlc6) 7 iLa3lWd6 8 d4! exd4 9 cxd4 lWxd4 10 'iVc1 !

3 ••• iLxc3! 4 bxc3 Which way to recapture is always a major decision. We'll run across this repeatedly in this
B
book, so it's worth setting the stage now. Re- capturing towards the centre by 4 bxc3 gives White a valuable extra centre pawn, a factor which should never be underestimated. Never- theless, the resulting pawn-structure has its own drawbacks, especially if Black can exploit the light squares (for example, by ... e4, controlling d3). It's also a bit difficult for White to get his bishops out to productive squares because the centre is congested. The alternative recapture 4 dxc3 has its own pluses and minuses. Again, getting White's bishops out is a key consideration, and the c1- bishop will be served best if White can achieve the e4 advance. Black will generally try to pre- vent this and cramp White's game by 4 ... lLlf6
(D).
w Now there can arise varied and instructive situations: a) 5 'iVc2, to cover e4, can be answered nor- mally by 5 ... d6 or aggressively by 5 ... e4; com- pare White's other 5th moves. In fact, 5 ... d5!?
INTRODUCTION TO 2 !Dc3: BLACK PLAYS FLEXIBLY 35
6 cxdS 'iVxdS is also unclear (bishops versus space). b) S i.d3!? e4 6 i.c2 d6 (D). Black's cramping pawn counteracts White's bishop-pair, so White will try to undermine it. Typical play would be 7 ttJe2 O-O 8 ttJg3 flie7. Now White can only free himself by f3, but then there are new weaknesses which compensate Black for White's bishops: 9 f3! exf3 10 'i!Vxf3 ttJc6 11 O-O ttJeS 12 'iVf4 i.d7 and Black's eS outpost makes his position too solid to break down directly, whereas White has some weak squares on the e-file. Probably White should combine e4 and ttJfS, when ... i.xfS levels things. c) Maybe White should insist upon S e4, when Black could simply play S ... d6 or S. .. O-O, leading to a standard type of position in which White's lost tempo of e3-e4 helps Black con- solidate, with an interesting game ahead. Al- ternatively, Black can choose to liquidate by S. .. ttJxe4!? 6 'i!VdS! ttJf6 (6 ... ttJgS!? 7 'i!VxeS+ ttJe6) 7 'ii'xeS+ 'ii'e7 8 'ii'xe7+ <J;xe7. This pro- duces a position in which White's bishops in the open field are a force, all the more so if an endgame arises. In positions with bishops ver- sus knights, the side with the knights should generally try to create outposts for them by means of pawn-breaks, which is not possible here. And although White's pawn-structure is not ideal, it takes a little experience to under- stand that it meshes reasonably well with the bishops. This structure comes up in other open- ings, most famously on the black side of the Ruy Lopez. Having said all that, White's ad- vantage is a limited one. Let's return to the game with 4 bxc3 (D):

1986. Black opens the a-file vis-a-vis White's
isolated a-pawn, and ... b6 allows Black to con- centrate upon light squares with some combi- nation of ... i.a6, ... dS and/or . ..lijc6-aS. The game was disastrous for White, and entertain- ing: 9 ttJg3 dS 10 c4 i.a6 11 ~3 cS 12 dxcS ttJbd7! 13 cxb6 dxc4!? 14 'i!Vb4?! ttJxb6 IS i.a3 l:te8 16 i.e2? ttJbdS 17 'i!Vd6 'i!Va5+ 18 <J;f1 c3 0-1. Black wins a piece and then some. S d4 ttJc6 6 ttJf3 ttJf6 7 i.a3 (D) A seeming advantage of bxc3 over dxc3 is that the bishop can come to the dynamic diag- onal a3-f8.

Black can try to take the initiative immedi- ately by 6 ... dS. White best responds with 7 cxdS, opening a path for his king' s bishop (oth- erwise, ... d4 will disturb his development still further). Then we have an important type of po- sition closely resembling a Sicilian Defence in reverse, but where White has two bishops and Black an extra knight. Both recaptures have their own justification: a) 7 ... lbxdS 8 "iic2 (D) is a TaimanovlKan Sicilian without Black's f8-bishop and White's bl-knight.

That is, the Sicilian Defence line goes 1 e4 cS 2lbf3 e6 3 d4 cxd4 4lbxd4 a6 Slbc3 "fiIc7. In the English Opening position, whom does this trade-off favour? It's a difficult question, because White has the bishop-pair and Black is able to castle very quickly. Notice that the f8- bishop would be Black's 'bad' bishop, which would tend to get stuck on the passive square e7, or be blocked by the e-pawn on f6 or d6. For White's part, he has a central pawn-majority, and the usual fortification versus attack that the TaimanovlPaulsen variations afford (Black's knights are limited by the pawns on e3 and a3). He can also launch his minority attack (b4) quickly without a knight on the queenside get- ting in the way. You could play either side of this unique position. b) Katrein-Sherzer, Philadelphia 1990 went 7 .. :~xdS!? 8 b4 (White expands and inciden- tally prevents ... lbaS-b3) 8 ... O-O 9 ..tb2 .l:Ie8!

A logical game with clear-cut posi- tional themes. Now let's return to the most popular move after 1 c4 e5 2 ttJc3 ~b4, namely: 3 ttJd5 (D) This has the obvious point of attacking the bishop to gain a tempo.
B
Our main games will involve the moves 3 ... ~c5 and 3 ... ~e7. Black has several alterna- tives, a few of which are perfectly playable; for example: a) The English Opening can support some strange ideas; for example, 3 ... ttJa6!? (retaining the idea of ... c6) 4 a3 (4 ttJxb4 ttJxb4 5 a3 ttJc6 is one of those many positions in which White's two bishops are neutralized by Black's quicker development, with a likely ... ttJf6 and ... d5 to come) 4 ... ~aS!? 5 b4 c6 6 ttJc3! ~c7 7 d4!.

advantage by 7 ... ttJe7, since 7 ... d5?! 8 cxd5 cxd5 9 dxe5 ~xe5 10 ~b2 followed by ttJf3 and e3 (or even e4) leaves him with a bad isolated pawn. b) 3 ... ~a5 is in disrepute at the moment, al- though I'm not sure that it can't be reinvigo- rated. At any rate, the established games seem to show how the two bishops can outweigh other factors if they're just given a little time; for example, 4 b4 c6 5 bxaS cxd5 6 cxd5 'iYxaS
7 e4 (7 'i!Bb3 has also had success, supporting
.i.a3 and in some cases planning ~g3) 7 ... ttJf6 8 i..d3!?

B
Then White enjoys a standard advantage with two bishops and space. Although Black has a fine outpost on c5 which should not be dis- counted, he can't easily coordinate to play ... ttJfd7 in the near future. Meanwhile, White can put great pressure on the queenside by ttJc3, ~fbl and in some cases a5. In addition, he has better prospects in the centre and can even expand on the kingside at some point should it come to that, in order to open a second front. Poldauf - Kasimdzhanov European Clubs Cup, Rethymnon 2003
1 c4 e5 2 ttJc3 ~b4 3 ttJd5 i..c5 (D)
No mystery here: Black puts his bishop on a natural square and prepares ... c6. 4 ttJf3 The obvious 4 b4leads to a variety of unique positions; for example, 4 ... i..d4 (4 ... .i.f8!? is also played - the third move with the bishop and it's back home!

Although White can hardly stand worse at move 8, Black's central presence gives him a good share of the play. 4 ••• e4!? This is the most critical move. The primary alternative is 4 ... c6 slbc3; for example, S. . :f1e7, when White should strike in the centre by either
6 e3 with the idea 6 ... e4 7 d4! ..ltb4! 8lbd2, or 6
d4 exd4 7 lbxd4 d6 8 g3 (or 8 ..ltf4, with per- haps a small pull based upon greater control of space) 8 ... lbf6 9 ..ltg2. White's position is pref- erable, but only just so. 5lbg5! This leads to some craziness. Similarly in- triguing structural issues arise from S d4..ltf8!? 6 lbd2 c6 7 lbc3 dS 8 e3 (D) with a kind of re- versed French Defence, a combination of the Tarrasch and Advance Variations!
B
By comparison with the Advance French, White is well ahead on time, but the knight on d2 isn't as effective as one posted on f4 (by way of e2 or h3), as happens in that line. Also, Black's knight on b8 is arguably better-placed than it would be on d7 (as is the case in the Tarrasch French). So White will probably exert pressure the centre by means of f3, with unclear consequences. 5 ••• e3!? (D) This exotic interference move looks like the best one! Instead, S. . Ji'xgS?! 6 d4 is not what Black wants, nor is S ... c6 6lbxe4.

Here Black takes a modem approach to the position, voluntarily giving up the bishop-pair without apparent compensation! But on closer examination, we find a concrete explanation. Let's assume that White captures the bishop, as he normally will on one of the next few moves. This means that three moves of the knight have been consumed to capture a bishop that has moved twice. And if Black recaptures with his queen, he is another piece ahead in develop- ment - notice that it is practically unassailable on e7, so the problems associated with getting a queen out too early don't apply here. More im- portantly, White has no easy way to get his kingside pieces out without subjecting them to attack (lbf3 is met by ... e4), so he can quickly get a cramped position. Black, on the other hand, is just two moves away from castling, and can play for ... d5. Of course, we needn't feel sorry for White, either. After all, many a master has made a liv- ing off using the bishop-pair. Notice too that, as yet, Black has no outposts for his knights. The trade-offs are similar to some lines of the Bogo-Indian and the Nimzo-Indian, in which Black gets ahead in development but White gains the bishop-pair without conceding any

w Black can also work up counterplay by at- tacking the front of the pawn-chain with 9 ... c6, a common idea in this pawn-structure.

w This modest move is very popular with expe- rienced players because it is so adaptable. That is, Black doesn't commit a knight and can still opt for systems with fundamentally different pawn-structures. For one thing, he can choose between ... ttJc6 and a move of the c-pawn ( ... c6 or ... cS). Similarly, he can set up with ... fS and ... ttJf6, or ... fS and ... ttJe7, or ... ttJf6 alone, or else ... ttJe7 alone. Those choices can be mixed with ... .i.e7 or a fianchetto ( ... g6 and ... .i.g7),
46 MASTERING THE CHESS OPENINGS
and so forth. In general, Black can switch strate- gies in response to White's own piece deploy- ments, rather than embark upon a single-minded course. Thus 2 ... d6 is a typically modem approach to the opening phase of the game. It limits White's ability to impose his choice of set-ups upon the position. On the other hand, 2 ... d6 has the obvious disadvantage of blocking in Black's bishop. Furthermore, since any such noncom- mittal move by Black also increases White's options, White can continuously adapt to his opponent's strategies. To begin with, White's main choices are 3 d4, 3 12Jf3 and 3 g3. I'll concentrate upon particularly distinctive lines arising from the first two moves, since so many continuations after 3 g3 (D) either trans- pose or closely resemble other systems in this book.
B
For example, 3 ... l2Jc6 4 i.g2 g6 Sl2Jf3 i.g7 is a Closed English (Chapter 6), and 3 ... l2Jf6 4 i.g2 (4 d4 exd4 S ~xd412Jc6 is a version of the main line 3 d4 below) 4 ... g6 S 12Jf3 (or S e4) leads to King's Indian variations that we'll be examining in Chapter 12. The fairly popular 3 ... fS either transposes to another variation or produces a type of ... fS po- sition to which I'm devoting plenty of space elsewhere. But I should mention that 3 ... fS can be met by the challenging 4 d4, when Black has various options; for example, 4 ... e4 (4 ... i.e7!? makes sense, challenging White to enter into the ending after S dxeS dxeS 6 ~xd8+ i.xd8; this is fascinating and hardly explored - proba- bly 7 e4!? is critical) S f3 12Jf6 (sometimes S. .. exf3 is played, followed by ... l2Jf6 and per- haps ... g6; that may be preferable) 6 i.g2 (6 fxe4!?) 6 ... exf3 712Jxf3. In this position, White has broken down Black's centre and probably holds some advantage in spite of his own weak- nesses on the e-file. Many other unique lines are possible after 3 g3; for example, 3 ... i.e6 4 i.g2 (or412Jf3, with the idea 4 ... i.xc4 S ~a4+ or 4 ... c6 S d4!) 4 ... c6 (4 ... l2Jc6 is a line from the Closed English in Chapter 6) S d3 (S b3 allows S ... dS!) S ... l2Jf6 6 12Jf3 i.e7 7 O-O O-O 8 b3, thinking about d4 and/or e4. Not surprisingly, there are many other ways for the players to come to an agreement upon a mutually acceptable position.

This is a very ambitious variation, and at the same time a risky one. White's basic idea is al- ways to control dS, thus preventing Black's freeing move ... dS. His command of the d-file should help him in that regard. White also de- velops a piece; that may seem a bit trivial, since Black can attack the queen by ... l2Jc6, but the net effect varies from case to case. In fact, we have already seen several exam- ples of playing d4, and after ... exd4, recaptur- ing by ~xd4. Let's compare some positions arising in the first few moves by using this framework of advantages and disadvantages: a) An example in which White gets the best of both worlds is 1 c4 eS 2 12Jc3 c6 3 d4 exd4 4 ~xd4 (incidentally preventing ... dS). Even then,
INTRODUCTION TO 2 tiJc3: BLACK PLAYS FLEXIBLY 47
the queen may eventually be exposed to attack, but not before it has had time to arrange an opti- mal escape. b) 1 c4 e5 2 d4?! exd4 3 'ilVxd4?! liJc6 was examined in Chapter 2. After White's queen re- treats and Black's next move (normally ... liJf6), Black will already have two minor pieces out, and in addition, ... d5 will be easy to enforce. c) In this chapter, we saw 1 c4 e5 2liJc3 f5 3 d4 exd4 4 'ili'xd4 liJc6. There .. .f5 is a non- developing move which even creates the poten- tial for certain weaknesses (e6, for example), so it looks as though White has the better of the bargain. Indeed, we looked at 5 ~e3+, which is promising, although hardly decisive, for White. At least the move ... f5 controls e4 and adds force to the idea of ... liJf6-e4. Let's return to our main position after 2liJc3 d6 3 d4 exd4 4 'ili'xd4. Here the situation isn't so one-sided. Black gains a tempo with 4 ... liJc6, but the move 2 ... d6 is not entirely positive for him, since it restricts the f8-bishop and effec- tively concedes control of the vital d5-square for the time being. On the other hand ... d6 opens a line for the c8-bishop and directly con- trols a central square (e5). Thus Black gains a modest edge in development, which can quickly grow as White tries to get his pieces out. In the end, White control of territory (in particular his control of d5 along an open file) competes with Black's activity (stemming from his develop- ment), and that's why so many grandmasters have chosen to play this variation from one side or the other. Let's turn to games: Ruban - Miles Belgrade 1988
1 c4 e5 2liJc3 d6 3 d4 exd4 4 ~xd4liJf6 (D)
As opposed to 4 ... liJc6, with the obvious gain oftempo, 4 ... liJf6!? has a more subtle idea: to leave the queen on d4, subject to later attack on the long diagonal following ... g6 and ... i..g7, all the while keeping open the options of ... c6 and ... liJbd7. 5b3
5 e4 is a reasonable option, with the idea
5 ... g6 (5 ... liJc6) 6 f3 i..g7 7 i..e3!? followed by ~d2 with a unique set-up. The best-known al- ternative is 5 g3.

(D) You could do worse than to study such posi- tions in order to broaden your command of pawn-structures. Notice that the absence of light-squared bishops distinguishes this position from some other English Opening variations, as well as from the Maroczy Bind variation of the Sicilian Defence. Superficially, one might think that the trade of bishops would favour White. In formal terms, after all, it is his 'bad' bishop that is exchanged. The question in such positions, however, is whether Black can sum- mon up the piece activity to counter White's significant long-term advantage. This often in- volves attacking light squares that can no lon- ger be guarded by White's bishop. Here those squares include h3, d3, f3 and often, depending upon specifics, b3. For example, a common outcome of the advance ... as-a4 would be the capture of a pawn on b3 ( ... axb3), which might be followed with ... lbfd7-cS, hitting d3 and b3. Finally, the moves ... fS, ... bS and ... dS can be said to attack the most important light squares of all. This all sounds very nice, but if Black isn't able to succeed in creating outposts and/or weaknesses at a fairly early stage, White can slowly drive back Black's pieces, advance his pawns, and stearnroll Black without much ef- fort. The move lS ... c6 fulfils the needs of the position as described. Given even one extra move here, White could probably consolidate. Thus Black concedes a weakness on d6 in re- turn for activity. He can create threats with his queen from as or b6, and simultaneously cause White to worry about ... dS, the ultimate line- opening move. Whether this works is a matter of timing and the skill of the respective players. Incidentally, some people think that the side with more space should avoid exchanges, but

9 Ji.g2
In Korchnoi-Spassky, Lugano 1982, White played the immediate 9 ttJh3. This knight heads for f4, to control d5 (the advantage of this move-order over 9 Ji.g2 and 10 ttJh3 will be seen below). For all the indignities that we have seen White suffer in this 3 d4 line above, this kind of bind may be his reward. The knight will come to f4, watching over d5, followed by Ji.g2, and Black's piece-play alone looks insuf- ficient to stir up tactical trouble. Furthermore, if Black plays aimlessly, White will be able to steadily increase his advantage and dominate the play. The game continued 9 ... ne8?! 10 ttJf4 Ji.g4

allows him to play ... e4 with tempo should his centre be challenged. 3 ... f5 is the move that most uniquely exploits the flexible nature of 2 ... d6. Other logical-looking moves have their own quirks: a) 3 ... lDc6 4 g3 is the Closed English of Chapter 5, but Black has given White the op- portunity for 4 d4!. Assuming that the move 2 ... lDc6 was otherwise acceptable to him, that was a better route to get to the desired posi- tion. b) Likewise, 3 ... g6 4 d4 is a shaky way to arrive at ... g6/ ... iLg7 systems, especially be- cause White gets the advantage after 4 ... iLg7?! (4 ... lDd7) 5 dxe5 dxe5 6 ~xdS+ ~xdS 7 e4!. This cedes the d4-square to Black, but after 7 ... lDc6 S iLg5+ f6 9 O-O-O+ iLd7 10 iLe3, there's no way to take advantage of it, and White has the direct idea of c5 with iLc4 and doubling on the d-file.

We reach a very common position in high- level chess, indicating both players' willingness to mix it up. If Black is satisfied with his play here, and likes the lines following 3 d4 exd4, he will have a repertoire based upon 2 ... d6 that
INTRODUCTION TO 2 lDc3: BLACK PLAYS FLEXIBLY 59
w doesn't sacrifice the opportunity for dynamic play. On the other hand, if White can gain a safe edge in this position, it gives him a way to by- pass the complexities of 3 d4 and 3 g3. By playing 4 ... e4, Black wants to force the white knight to an awkward square and main- tain a space advantage, whereas White hopes that Black is overextended. Typically White will try to undermine the e4 point or advance on the queenside. He has several reasonable moves, and I think it's fair to say that all of them lead to complex play with plenty of life. Let's briefly examine two of these responses to 4 ... e4 before turning to games. a) 5lbd2 (D) is sound, but passive.
B
There can follow 5 ... lbf6 6 e3, and Black can equalize with the standard plan of 6 ... c6 intend- ing .. .tba6-c7. He can then develop normally by ... J..e7 and ... O-O, or in some cases ... d5 and ... J..d6 might follow. Also played are 6 ... g6 7 J..e2 i.g7 and 6 ... c5!?, to put pressure on the d4-pawn and try to induce it to go to d5. b) A deceptively ambitious move is 5 lbgl !?
(D).
B
White has ideas of imitating a French De- fence with colours reversed by playing e3, and this provides opportunities for both sides; for example: bI) 5 ... c6 6 lbh3 and now 6 ... d5?! 7 cxd5 cxd5 8 'iHb3 (or 8 J..g5) 8 ... lbc6! 9 e3 lbf6 10 J..d2!, intending lbf4, favours White. Naturally,. Black won't be inclined to go along with this, and can play 6 ... J..e7! (versus 7 J..g5) 7 lbf4 lbf6 8 e3 O-O, perhaps with ... lba6-c7 in mind. A variant on this is the immediate 6 ... lba6 7 e3 (7 J..g5!? is interesting) 7 ... lbf6 8 lbf4lbc7 9 d5! J..e7 10 b3!? 0-011 J..b2 J..d7 12 J..e2 g5! with unclear play. Both sides can be confident of getting their share of the action in such posi- tions. b2) Black probably wants to avoid 5 ... lbf6 6 J..g5!, when White's side is easier to play; for example, 6 ... J..e7 7 e3 O-O 8lbh3 c6 9 lbf4 lba6
10 J..e2 (D).

60 MASTERING THE CHESS OPENINGS
This is pretty much the ideal set-up for White in terms of piece coordination and availability of pawn attacks on all parts ofthe board (b4-bS, dS, f3 and even h4-hS). He may not have a forced advantage, but the position is promising. One game went 1O .. .'~Jc7 11 ~3 h6?! (ll...lIb8 120-0 i.e6! 13 f3 exf3 14lIxf3! is slightly in White's favour) 12 i.xf6 i.xf6 13 liJg6 ~e8, Shvedchikov-Iashvili, Moscow 1999, and here
14 O-O makes it difficult for Black to unwind.
For example, l4 ... 'ii;>h7 IS i.hS liJe6 16liJe2! intending f3, and meeting 16 ... liJf8 by 17liJef4. Lautier - Cu. Hansen Biel1992

By contrast with other lines in which he plays e3, White gets his bishop in front of the pawn-chain first. The drawback is that it helps Black develop quickly: 5 ... i.e7 S. .. liJf6 is also possible, when after 6 liJd2 i.e7 7 e3 O-O the set-up with ... c6 and ... liJa6-c7 has equalized. However, 6liJgl is more attrac- tive - compare SliJgl in the previous game. 6 i.xe7 'Wixe7 (D) w 7liJd2 With 7liJglliJf6 8 e3, White wants to playa sort of French Defence without his bad bishop. Black needn't cooperate by playing an immedi- ate ... dS, since he also has 8 ... O-O 9liJh3 c6 10 i.e2liJa6 11 'iVc2liJc7, Uliashev-Lukin, St Pe- tersburg 1992. Then ... dS or ... i.e6 and .. J:tb8 can follow, with a strong centre. For his part, White can go for queenside action via b4-bS. 7 ... liJf6 8 e3 O-O 9 i.e2 c5!? Black would like to provoke White into play- ing dS, which would give his own knight a fine square on eS and introduce the prospect of at- tack by ... f4. 10 liJb3 i.e6 11 O-O i.f7 This is useful in preventing f3, since the e- pawn will hang after ... exf3. 12lIc1liJa6!? 13 'iVd2 (D)
B
White prepares lIfd 1 to exert a little pressure down the d-file. He also renews the idea of f3, although it's not always clear whom that fa- vours.
13. .. l:lad8 14liJal!? (D)
A clever idea. White wants to free his b- pawn for defence (by b3) or attack (by b4); and even more so, he would like to play liJc2 and B. The main alternative is 14 BlIde8, and now IS f4! prepares liJdS and could give White the faster attack, especially since the natural plan of ... 'ii;>h8, ... lIg8 and ... gS is slow and hard to implement.

5 .•• ii.e7 Black stays flexible, in the spirit of 2 ... d6 and 3 .. .fS. The alternatives are instructive because of the pawn-structures that arise: a) The elastic move S ... c6 is often played, sometimes transposing. Black may choose to delay the development of his kingside pieces; e.g., 6 tiJh3 tiJa6 7 e3 (7 ii.gS!?) 7 ... tiJf6 8 tiJf4 tiJc7 (one of many variants on this basic piece disposition) 9 d5!? ii.e7 10 b3 O-O 11 ii.b2 ii.d7 with mutual chances, Timman-Yusupov, Am- sterdam 1994. The position became even more unbalanced after 12 ii.e2 gS!. b) For quite some time Black was enam- oured of the space-grab S ... h6 6 tiJh3 g5 (D). w The basic idea is to develop by ... tiJf6 and ... ii.g7.

62 MASTERING THE CHESS OPENINGS
wants to immobilize Black's pawn-structure by 8 h4, after which he will get a freer hand in the centre and on the queenside. Illescas- Hodgson, Spanish Team Ch 1993 continued 7 ... ttJf6 (7 ... iLg7 8 h4 g4 9 e3 ttJd7 10 ttJge2 h5 11 ttJf4 gave White the desired advantage in Portisch-Seirawan, Mar del Plata 1982; of course, the game is only beginning) 8 h4l:tg8?! 9 hxg5 hxg5 10 ttJh3 g4 11 ttJf4 c6 12 e3 ttJa6 13 iLd2 ttJc7 14 'i!kb3 "fIe7 15 O-O-O l:tb8 16 iLe2 iLd7 17 f3!, and Black's king was stuck in the middle. 6 ttJh3 This is the main move, but perhaps more at- tention should be given to 6 h4!? (D).
B
The idea is to anchor the knight on f4 after ttJh3-f4. 6 h4 is sound because of the pseudo- tactical point that 6 ... h6 7 ttJh3 iLxh4 is risky in view of 8 ttJf4 (or 8 e3) 8 ... iLg5!? 9 ttJg6l:th7 10 c5!? with the idea iLc4. Then Black should steer clear of 1O ... d5? 11 ttJxd5! ~xd5 12 iLxg5. After 6 h4!?, moreover, the thematic 6 ... c6 can be met by the developing move 7 iLf4, while 7 d5!? is also playable. That brings us to 6 ... ttJf6 7 e3, when the complicated position af- ter 7 ... O-O 8 iLe2 c6 9 d5!? (9 ttJh3 ttJg4 10 h5!? is quite unclear) 9 ... ttJa6 has been tested a few times and seems about equal. Maybe White should consider the simple 7 iLf4, when a com- plex battle could result from 7 ... ttJh5 8 e3!? g6; e.g., 9 ttJh3 with the idea 9 ... iLxh4 10 iLh6, or even 9 iLh2 h6!? 10 ttJh3 iLxh4 11 iLe2 fol- lowed by ttJf4. There is certainly plenty to try out here! 6 ••• c67 e3 ttJf6 8 ttJf4 ttJa6 (D) w This position has arisen in many games, and contains the same ideas that we've seen in the notes. White has several possible plans, includ- ing d5 (to grab space and control e6), f3 (to break up the front of the pawn-chain), and b4- b5. Black would like to play moves like ... d5 and ... g5, but can take his time with ... O-O, ... ttJc7 and ... 'it>h8. If White then plays d5, Black will often simply capture on that square and train his forces upon the pawn there, which is effectively isolated. 9h4 Played in the clear majority of games. White assumes that ... g5 will be strong at some point, so he may as well prevent it now.

The timing of this move is critical. White could also consider a more neutral approach such as 11 ~b3. l1 ... cxdS ll...ltJd7 with the idea ... ltJe5 is similar, but Black wants to clarify the central structure. 12 cxdSltJd7! (D) w Black takes advantage of the fact that White's d5 has given him the e5-square and activity along the al-h8 diagonal. Even White's pawn on h4 has become a problem, discouraging him from castling. 13 g3?! Now White's kingside pawns are static and f3 is weak. Also, after 13ltJe6? ltJxe6 14 dxe6 ltJe5 (or 14 ... ltJc5) he soon loses a pawn. Best is 13 h5!, although Black can be quite satisfied af- ter 13 ... ltJe5. 13 ... i.f614 ~f1 14 i.d2 i.e5!? 15 .l:tc1 ltJf6 was the stem game Ruban-Anand, Palma de Mallorca 1989; that makes it difficult for White to defend his d-pawn in the face of attacks on it by ...

Perhaps this rook would be better off on dl, watching over the d-pawn. After 19 .i:thc1, Black should probably play 19 ... 'iVe7, intending ...

It looks as though this fascinating main line is wholly satisfactory for Black, and that White should investigate the rarely-played 6 h4. It's amazing how much active and refreshing chess can be generated from a simple move like 2 ... d6. Because of its flexibility, both players will combine to shape the nature of the contest, which can run the full gamut from highly tacti- cal to subtly positional. 4 2 ... ttJf6 and g3 Systems Introduction to 2 ... lDf6
1 c4 e5 2 liJc3 liJf6 (D)
w Having explored some other moves after 1 c4 e5 2liJc3, we'll tum our eyes to the traditional continuation 2 ... liJf6, which contests the key central squares d5 and e4. By this means Black continues his imitation of White's main Sicil- ian Defence set-up, that is, I e4 c5 2liJf3, and asks his opponent to commit to a formation. In this chapter, I'll examine systems with an early g3 and .ltg2, primarily 2 liJc3 liJf6 3 g3 (D), which has been central to the historical de- velopment of the English Opening.
B
When White plays 3 g3, he is doing what a clear majority of Sicilian players would do as Black. By this I mean that, when playing against most variations of the Sicilian Defence in which White omits the move d4, Sicilian devotees use ... g6 and ... .ltg7 as their default plan. After 1 e4 c5, for example, we see 2liJc3 liJc6 and now 3 g3 g6 or 3 f4 g6. Versus 2liJf3liJc6 3 .ltb5, the fianchetto by 3 ... g6 is also the most popular move. Thus it makes perfect sense to follow 1 c4 e5 2liJc3liJf6 with 3 g3. Here trade-offs be- tween time and information assume special im- portance, and we can learn a lot about both the English Opening and Sicilian Defence by com- paring and contrasting similar positions. It turns out that both 3 ... .ltb4 and 3 ... c6 take on a char- acter which might not be anticipated if one were only looking at them with the eyes of a Si- cilian Defence player. Much the same applies to White's other fian- chetto line I c4 e5 2 g3. This closely resembles a Hyper-Accelerated Dragon (1 e4 c5 2 liJf3 g6) with reversed colours; and again, Black's knowledge about White's intentions allows him to compensate for being a tempo behind. As usual, we'll get oriented by looking at a few rarely-played third moves for White. As we see in this game, they resemble White's 2nd moves in Chapter 2 and may even transpose. Van Wely - Kasparov Tilburg 1998
1 c4 e5 2 liJc3 liJf6 3 e3
With this flexible move, White is aiming for some sort of reversed Sicilian Defence or French Defence position, preferably leading to rela- tively unexplored positions. Although hardly a dire threat to Black, 3 e3 is one of White's more interesting irregular choices; it also has the po- tential to be used as a transpositional tool. Alternatively, White can go for even more modest pawn moves. One of these, 3 d3, isn't 2 . ..tbj6 AND g3 SYSTEMS 65 very forceful, since it relinquishes the possibil- ity of d4 for the time being. I discussed and ana- lysed this in Chapter 2 under the move-order 1 B c4 e5 2 d3 ~f6 3 ~c3. Similarly, 3 a3 (D) is flexible, but too modest to give an advantage.
B
Black has several good answers, among them: a) 3 ... ~c6 4 b4 (4 ~f3 g6 is a pleasant vari- ation of the English Four Knights for Black - see Chapter 5) 4 ... g6 5 ~b2 ~g7 with equal- ity, since trying to disturb Black's development by 6 b5 ~d4 (or 6 ... ~e7 7 ~f3 d6) 7 e3 ~e6 doesn't achieve anything. b) 3 ... g6 is another good idea: 4 ~f3 ~c6, intending 5 b4?! e4! 6 ~g5 ~g7 7 J:1bl O-O! with the idea 8 ~gxe4 ~xe4 9 ~xe4 ~e8; we'll examine this in Chapter 5 under the order 2 ~c3 ~f6 3 ~f3 ~c6 4 a3 g6. c) 3 ... c6 is unexciting but sufficient: 4 ~f3 (4 d4 exd4 5 'iWxd4 ~a6!, and ... ~c5 will soon come with the threat of ... ~b3, illustrating the drawbacks of a3; White should avoid 6 b4?! c5! 7 'iVe5+ ~e7 8 b5 ~c7) 4 ... e4 5 ~d4 d5. This gives us a reverse variant of the Alapin Sicilian (1 e4 c5 2 c3 ~f6 3 e5 ~d5 4 ~f3 ~c6 5 d4), with an extra move a3 for White, which is not necessarily an advantage for him. Play might go 6 cxd5 ~c5!? 7 ~b3 ~b6 and capturing the c-pawn with 8 dxc6?! ~xc6 is very risky, as in the reversed position. Better is 8 d3 exd3 9 'tixd3 O-O! with equality. We now return to 3 e3 (D):
3. .. ~c6
Here are a couple of alternatives for Black, often leading to structures and ideas that we've seen elsewhere: a) 3 ... d5 (somewhat obliging, but not neces- sarily bad) 4 cxd5 ~xd5 5 ~f3 (5 'iWc2 resem- bles the Taimanov Variation of the Sicilian) 5 ... ~c6 (5 ... ~xc3 6 bxc3 ~d6 7 d4 is another well-known reversed Taimanov Sicilian posi- tion in which White has an extra tempo; White wants to utilize his central majority while Black would like to scare something up on the king- side; my guess is that most strong players would prefer to have the white pieces, but it's certainly playable for both sides). After 5 ... ~c6, we've arrived at a position that can also arise by means of the more conventional move-order 2 ~c3 ~f6 3 ~f3 ~c6 4 e3 d5 5 cxd5 ~xd5. At this point, the seldom-played 6 'tic2 is a good alternative to look into, but the approved move is 6 ~b5 (D).
B
White is held to stand better held, but that isn't at all clear. Black can continue 6 ... ~xc3 (6 ... 'iWd6!? looks slow, but is not so easy to re- fute; White has tried 7 d4 exd4 8 ~xd4!? ~xc3 9 bxc3 ~d7 10 O-O with only a small

advantage) 7 bxc3 i.d6 (not 7 ... e4?! 8 tZ'le5 ~d5 9 ~a4 i.d7 10 tZ'lxd7 'iitxd7 lli.c4!) 8 e4 (8 d4 e4! with the idea 9 tZ'ld2 'ti'g5!) 8 ... O-O 9 O-O (9 d4?! is a book move, but Black might find 9 ... exd41O cxd4 .l:te8! 11 e5 i.b4+) 9 ... 'iVe7! 10 l:!.bl i.d7 with apparent equality. b) 3 ... i.b4 is a standard move that White plays in the Sicilian. Then 4 tZ'lge2 is a tempo ahead of the variation 1 e4 c5 2 tZ'lf3 tZ'lc6 3 i.b5 e6!? 4 O-O (4 i.xc6 is sometimes played) 4 ... tZ'lge7, often chosen by grandmasters. Once again, the question is whether an extra tempo means enough for White. Interesting play re- sults; for example, 4 ... O-O 5 a3 i.xc3 (5 ... i.e7 6 d4 is also complex) 6 tZ'lxc3 and now 6 ... c6 can be met by 7 d4 exd4 8 ~xd4 d5 9 M, which gives White the bishop-pair for little gain. So 6 ... tZ'lc6 is more natural, when 7 ~c2!? d5 8 cxd5 tZ'lxd5 9 i.d3 g6 10 i.e2!? with the idea d3 produces a unique and intriguing situation. In comparison with a Sicilian Defence, it's not clear whether Black's missing bishop is worth more or less than White's missing knight. We see how reversed positions take on a character of their own, or at the very least have their own dynamic. If White feels comfortable with these lines, and with the options in our main game, he might enjoy playing 3 e3 as a way to enter combat without requiring too much in the way of theoretical preparation. Now we return to 3 ... tZ'lc6 (D): w 4a3 This is an ambitious attempt to expand on the queenside. Instead, 4 tZ'lf3 transposes to the variation 3 tZ'lf3 tZ'lc6 4 e3, examined in Chap- ter 5. In any case, Black's rapid development renders 4 d4?! dubious following 4 ... exd4 5 exd4 i.b4! (e.g., 6 d5 tZ'le5!). 4 ... g6! (D) Black has the lUxury of fianchettoing, since White has no pressure on the centre. In fact, as a rule of thumb, the move ... g6 is a good choice in the English Opening when White is developing slowly. w 5 b4 Black can equalize against 5 d4 by 5 ... exd4 6 exd4 d5, when 7 i.g5 i.e7! 8 tZ'lf3 i.g4 high- lights the poor state of White's kingside devel- opment. 5 ... i.g7 6 i.b2 O-O (D) w 7d3 Even though this looks consistent with a Si- cilian Defence, it will be hard for White to get his kingside pieces out. A Taimanov-style ap- proach would be 7 ~c2!, when the play can go in many directions; for example, 7 ... .l:te8 (try- ing to discourage tZ'lf3 by means of the move

Black's 3rd-Move Options Now we'll return to 3 g3 (D), the main subject of this chapter, which is described above in general terms.
B
I have given most of my attention to 3 ... .Bb4 and 3 ... c6. Nevertheless, following the philoso- phy of working from fundamentals, I'll take an abbreviated look at some of Black's other third moves, beginning with these: a) 3 ... g6 will normally lead into another sys- tem, very often related to the King's Indian De- fence. Along those lines, Black has a couple of ways to avoid the standard variations that arise later in this book. A nice game that shows some basic ideas is Chiburdanidze-Uhlmann, Aruba 1992: 4 .Bg2 .Bg7 S d3 (I've adjusted the game's move-order to make the point that S tbf3 is the normal way to shoot for advantage by playing d4; in fact, Black either opts for a slow King's Indian Defence after S ... d6 6 d4, or he assumes a theoretically slightly inferior line following S ... tbc6 6 O-O O-O 7 d4 exd4 8 tbxd4; it's worth noting, however, that some strong players use this latter variation) S ... O-O 6 tbf3 l'!e8 (by means of his move-order, Black has gone without ... d6 and can now try for ... dS di- rectly) 7 O-O c6!? 8 tbd2?! (a slow move; White should probably react with more urgency; for example, he can discourage ... dS by 8 .igS, planning 8. .. h6 9 .Bxf6 "iWxf6 10 e3 with the idea of d4, although that gives up the bishop- pair) 8 ... tba6 9 l'!bl dS 10 b4 dxc4?!

(White can avoid strengthen- ing Black's centre by ignoring the b-pawn; Ribli recommends 12 tbe4! with the idea 12 ... tbaxb4 13 tbcd6l:te7 14 .igS!, ending in advantage) 12 ... cxdS 13 tbe3 .Be6 14 ~a4 tbc7 IS bS 'iVd7 (Black has the big centre, and threatens ... a6) 16 ~3 d4! 17 tbc4 tbdS 18 .Bd2 tbb6! 19 a4 tbxc4 20 dxc4 )lac8 (it's not only that Black is attacking the backward c-pawn; more impor- tantly, his own centre pawns are ready to ad- vance) 21l:tfc1 .Bf8!? 22 as .ifS 23 l'!b2 e4 24 b6 axb6 2S axb6 (2S "iWxb6 runs into 2S ... .Ba3) 2S ... .icS 26 .Bf4l:1c6! 27 .Bc7 l'!ee6 (D).

w rather than f3/f6, because from there it can at- tack the opposing d-pawn. Whether such an ad- vantage is enough to convert into a win is an open question, but here White stands better af- ter 9 lbge2 lbc6 10 .Bg5 .Be6 11 O-O O-O 12 lbf4. b12) Black can also play 5 ...

White's active rooks and bishop-pair domi- nate the play, and he went on to win. The Modern Variation: 3 ... ~b4
1 c4 eS 2liJc3liJf6 3 g3 .i.b4
One of the most serious theoretical shifts in the English Opening came with the discovery that 3 ... i.b4 is not only playable, but gives Black as many chances for advantage as White. For decades, a majority of players had concen- trated upon 3 ... c6, the Keres Variation, which will be discussed later in this chapter. Regard- less of the precise theoretical state of 3 ... c6, the move became associated with lines in which Black had to play very accurately to escape seri- ous trouble. Moreover, Black suffered a number of well-publicized defeats with 3 ... c6. Black's shyness about playing the Reversed Dragon with 3 ... d5 4 cxd5 liJxd5 was influenced by similar experiences, although that has changed today. At any rate, the move 3 ... .i.b4 has done more to discourage 3 g3 than any other factor, and accounts for the fact that 3 liJf3 is now White's most popular move among masters. It is also responsible for the increased interest in 1
2.JLJj6 AND g3 SYSTEMS 71
c4 eS 2 g3, which obviously renders ... iLb4 ir- relevant for the time being. Of course, some of this is fashion, and a number of masters use 2 ttJc3 ttJf6 3 g3 as their main weapon. Moreover, if a few top-level play- ers reconsider 3 g3 iLb4 and come up with new ideas for White, 3 g3 will soon become the trendy choice. Even as theory stands today, many theoretically 'equal' positions that result from it are interesting and full of content. w Larsen - Petrosian Milan 1975
1 c4 ttJf6 2 ttJc3 eS 3 g3 iLb4 (D)
4 ttJf3 4 iLg2 is by far the favourite move here, but there are some logical points behind this un- common choice. For one thing, White tries to make Black commit to the defence or advance of his e-pawn before he can play ... O-O and ... l:te8, moves that often follow 4 iLg2. A cou- ple of lesser ideas for White are worth mention- ing: a) 4 ttJdS is in general not an effective idea if 4 ... ttJxdS S cxdS doesn't attack a knight on c6. Compare 4 iLg2 O-O S ttJdS below (specifically, the note to White's Sth move in the game Kor- chnoi-Tseitlin). b) The tempo-winning 4 iVb3 ttJc6 S ttJdS looks more to the point. However, after s ... iLcs White's queen is poorly placed on b3. The best-known example is 6 e3 0-07 iLg2 ttJxdSl 8 cxdS ttJe7 9 ttJe2 d6 10 O-O c6 (1O ... iLg41 11 f3 iLd7 is the simplest equalizer) 11 d4 exd4 12 exd4 iLb6 13 iLgS iLd7 followed by ... h6, and Black had satisfactory play in Korchnoi-Kar- pov, World Ch (game 2S), Baguio City 1978. 4•.• e4 (D) Black takes up the challenge; 4 ... ttJc6 would enter the Four Knights Variation of the next chapter. w S ttJd4 S ttJgS has the disadvantage that after S. .. iLxc3 6 dxc3 O-O 7 iLg2 .l:e8 8 "i;¥c2 iVe7 9 O-O d6 10 ttJh3 iLfS 11 ttJf4 c6, White's knight has made four moves to get to f4, a square that he usually uses as a springboard to dS. Since dS is unavailable, White even has to be wary of the move ... gS followed by ... h6, when the knight will become stuck and vulnerable on h3. S••. ttJc6 Black directly challenges the knight on d4. This is the standard idea, as we shall see in many games. Nevertheless, he has other ap- proaches to this kind of position. A logical al- ternative is S ... O-O 6 iLg2 l::!.e8 (or 6 ... iLxc3 first), with two-sided play following 7 iVc21? iLxc3 8 dxc3 h6 9 iLf4 d6 10 O-O-O ttJbd7. 6 ttJc2 (D) It's important to know that 6 ttJxc6?! dxc6 opens too many lines for Black; after the move ... iLfS, White's d-pawn won't be able to ad- vance safely.

White often ends up with a backward d-pawn that can't be advanced without creating weaknesses. 7 ... h6 7 ... 0-08 i.gS is somewhat better for White because Black's knight is already on c6 and the manoeuvre tLle3-dS gains effect.

Now White has to consider how to make progress. It's informative to look at this as a re- versed-colour variation of a line of the Rosso- limo Sicilian, which goes 1 e4 c5 2liJf3 liJc6 3 .tb5 g64 O-O i..g7 (D). w In our English Opening version, Black has a tempo less; so couldn't White claim some ad- vantage by playing typical Sicilian moves at this point? Unfortunately, as we have learned, knowing what your opponent is doing can par- tially compensate for being a tempo behind. Thus anything that White does commits him to a structure and/or piece placement, and Black can adjust his strategy accordingly. Let's exam- ine some continuations to see whether that's sufficient for Black to equalize. We'll start with the Rossolimo Sicilian posi- tion. How does White try to make progress after 40-0 .tg7? I'll show some standard ideas with a selection of theoretical details, and then com- pare them with our English Opening 3 ... i..b4 variation. A side benefit is that I shall provide belated coverage of the Rossolimo Sicilian it- self! a) In the Sicilian, 5 c3 is usually answered by 5 ... liJf6, since liJc3 is no longer available to White. Let's be clear about that. In our English Opening variation, after 3 g3 i..b4 4 i..g2 O-O 5 liJf3 l:!e8 6 O-O e4 7 liJd4, Black has the ideal move 7 ... liJc6!, after which 8liJxc6?! dxc6 gives Black open lines and freer play (see the game Cuellar-Uhlmann below). In the Sicilian posi- tion, White's 'extra' move is 5 c3, so if he meets 5 ... liJf6 with 6 e5 liJd5, he can't then play the desirable liJc3. There might follow 7 d4 cxd4 8 cxd4. After 8 ... d6 9liJc3, 9 ... liJxc3 10 bxc3 O-O is theoretically equal, while 9 ... i..e6!? is in- triguing. Instead of 6 e5, White can develop slowly, but to gain any advantage he has to play ambitiously at some point; for example, 6l:!el (a move rec- ommended more often than not) 6 ... O-O (D). w Now White has two main approaches: al) 7 d4 d5! (this is more ambitious and probably better than 7 ... cxd4 8 cxd4 d5 9 e5 liJe4, a well-known position in which, how- ever, Black stands satisfactorily) 8 e5 (8 exd5 ~xd5 9 c4 ~d6) 8 ... liJe4. Remarkably, we've reached a position that is probably slightly more difficult to play from White's side of the board! a2) 7 e5liJd5 8 d4 (D).
B
Now 8 ... d6!? is a challenging move that might attract some players, but the most solid variation is 8 ... cxd4 9 cxd4 d6. After 10 liJc3, one line is 1O ... dxe5 11 i..xc6 bxc6 12 liJxe5, when 12 ... 'ifb6 should be good enough (13 ~a4
74 MASTERING THE CHESS OPENINGS
i.xe5 14 dxe5 lLlxc3 15 bxc3 i.e6). But, as above, 1O ... i.e6!? is even more interesting. Then 11 lLlg5? is very strongly met by 11 ... dxe5 12lLlxe6 fxe6 13 i.xc6 bxc6 14 dxe5 't!fb6, and after the natural 11 i.g5, ll...dxe5 12 i.xc6 bxc6 13 lLlxe5 1:tc8 holds on to the bishop-pair and contemplates moves like ... f6 and ... c5. In conclusion, White's move 5 c3 in the Si- cilian Defence tips his hand, and Black can choose the appropriate defensive system. Com- pare variations of the English Opening below in which Black can play ... c6 successfully, only because White isn't able to respond by lLlf3! b) Returning to the Rossolimo position after 40-0 i.g7, 5 I:tel (D) fights for an edge without committing to the move c3.
B
Now 5 ... lLlf6 might be met by 6 e5 with the idea 6 ... lLld5 7 lLlc3!, again utilizing the avail- ability of White's c3-square. In fact, 6lLlc3 in- tending e5 is also good. Nevertheless, tipping his hand by 5 .:i.el once again limits what White can achieve. It's more logical for Black to play the typical defence 5 ... e5, since the rook on el is not very useful in that case (in a couple of situations, it might even be better placed on f1, supporting the ad- vance f4). Then there are various continuations, but with Black intending 6 ... lLlge7 to reinforce c6, the most common one is 6 i.xc6 dxc6 7 d3 WIIe7!? 8lLlbd2 (8 b3; 8 a3!?, with ideas ofb4, when 8 ... a5 !? is interesting) 8 ... lLlf6 9 lLlc4lLld7 . I think White may have a very small edge in this line, but it hasn't translated into much in prac- tice. In the reversed English Opening position, af- ter 4 i.g2 O-O, Black can hold off with the move ... 1:te8. As we just saw, the best position for that rook isn't known yet. c) Returning to the Rossolimo Sicilian, 5 lLlc3 (D) is another instructive attempt.
B
But this is also a committal move, and per- mits Black to play 5 ... lLld4. Remember that ... lLld4 is more effective when White has a knight on c3, so that an exchange on d4 forces White to lose a tempo after ... cxd4. Probably 6 l:1el would follow, permitting the exchange on b5 to uncertain effect. Compare the reversed English Opening po- sition, after 3 g3 i.b4 4 i.g2 O-O. Black hasn't played ... lLlc6, so 5lLld5 is harmless (the knight can be exchanged without loss of time); see the note to move 5 in Korchnoi-Tseitlin below. Furthermore, 5 ... e5 is a perfectly adequate reply to 5 lLlc3, especially since a knight or bishop on d5 can be exchanged off (after 6lLld5 lLlge7, for example). In that case, Black's pre- ferred set-up would be ... lLlge7, ... O-O, ... d6, ... i.e6 and ... d5. d) Finally, in part because he hasn't made much progress with the 5th moves above, White has turned to the slightly cooperative 5 i.xc6. We already looked at this and the reversed posi- tion by transposition in Chapter 3 in the game Illescas-Sisniega, Novi Sad Olympiad 1990 (see the note to the main move 8 ... lLle7). Spe- cifically, we saw the position after 5 i.xc6 dxc6

In the early days of the Keres this was quite popular. White attacks e5 and practically forces the following concession in the centre. 4 .•• exd45 'tWxd4 d5 (D) White's queen is aggressively placed, and he will try to train his pieces on d5; the moves i.g2 and i.g5 serve that purpose. But first he has to make some fundamental decisions over this and the next few moves, primarily when to ex- change pawns, taking into account that Black might play ... c5 or ... dxc4 at the right moment, and that if White exchanges pawns on d5, he opens the way for Black's knight to come to c6 with tempo. This means that move-order is w critical. Let's look into the theory in the context of this game. 6cxd5 White wants to fix the pawns right away, but as mentioned, this permits Black to develop by ... tZ'lc6 and encourages the advance ... d4 with further gain of time. If White can wait before exchanging on d5, Black may have to play the suboptimal ... i.e7 or ... i.e6 at an early stage. One of several issues is whether ... dxc4 will be an easy equalizer in that case. This all plays out in the following examples: a) 6 i.g2 i.e6 (6 ... dxc4 7 ~xc4 i.e6 8 ~a4 tZ'lbd7 is considered equal, but White's pieces seem to coordinate slightly better; for example, 9 tZ'lf3 tZ'lc5!? 10 'iVc2 'iia5 !?, and now not 11 i.d2 tZ'lb3!, but 11 i.e3!

Instead, 8 i.g5 is often given as slightly 2 . ..tfJj6 AND g3 SYSTEMS 87 better for White, based on lines continuing 8 ... i.e7. That is unconvincing after 8 ... tbc6 9 'ilia4 (after 9 i.xf6?, both 9 ... tbxd4 10 i.xd8 tbc2+ and the safer 9 ... gxf6 followed by ... d4 favour Black) 9 ... 'ilib6! 10 i.xf6 gxf6, which seems to be equal; for example, 11 O-O-O! O-O-O! 12 i.xdS (12 e3 d4) 12 ... i.xdS 13 tbxdS1\VcS+ 14 tbc3 i:txdl+ IS "iVxdl "iVxf2 with chances for both sides. b) 6 i.gS i.e7! (6 ... dxc4 7 ~xd8+ 'it>xd8 8 O-O-O+!

Compare 6 tbf3 below; in fact, 12 ... O-O would transpose directly to that line. c) Still another try is 6 tbf3 (directed against ... d4) 6 ... i.e7 (6 ... dxc4!? is also reasonable), when White again has to deal with Black's po- tential expansion: cl) 7 i.g2 cS! 81\Vd3 d4 9 tbe4 tbc6 with a position that is level or slightly favouring Black, Pfleger-Keres, Bamburg 1968. c2) 7 cxdS cxdS 8 i.g2 tbc6 9 'iVa4 O-O 10 O-O (D) is a standard position characteristic of the isolated queen's pawn.

1 c4 e5 2 g3 (D)
B
2liJc3 is still the dominant move in the Eng- lish Opening by a large margin. Nevertheless, over the last decade, White has increasingly played the fianchetto 2 g3 in order to avoid cer- tain bothersome variations that can arise after 2 liJc3. This can greatly simplify his task; for one thing, playing 2liJc3 means that in several varia- tions White has to deal with the move ... ~b4, 2 ... l:iJj6 AND g3 SYSTEMS 91 and 2 g3 sidesteps them (I'll discuss that pres- ently). On the other hand, 2 g3 commits White to a fianchetto and thus eliminates numerous varia- tions which involve some combination of moves such as lbc3, lbf3, e3, d4, etc. Therefore, before plunging into lines stemming from 2 g3, it's worthwhile to discuss the ramifications of this choice. First, we want to see which sequences of moves after 2 g3 can lead to independent lines, and which will transpose into other English Opening variations (or even to other openings entirely). Then, what are the concrete advan- tages and difficulties that accompany it? Right off, someone who plays 2 g3 should consider what he wants to do after 1 c4lbf6 (D) (instead of l...e5). Then 2 lbc3 e5 already commits White to learning 1 c4 e5 2lbc3lbf6 variations, which is one thing he is trying to steer clear of by play- ing 2 g3! In that case White would have to deal with theory that is unique to both 1 c4 e5 2 g3 and 1 c4 e5 2 lbc3 lbf6. That's a lot to ask. White can choose 2 lbf3, of course, but that may have nothing to do with the kinds of posi- tions that he is aiming for. So one question would be how 1 c4lbf6 2 g3 fits in with White's plans. Unfortunately, this opens a new can of worms. For example, how does White want to cope with 1 c4lbf6 2 g3 e6? Presumably 3 i.g2 d5 or 3 lbf3 d5 follows, when White can play 4 d4 with a Catalan, or leave his d-pawn alone and enter into some kind of Reti with b3 and i.b2. In addition, White has to consider 1 c4 lbf6 2 g3 c6 and 3 ... d5. Or, against a King's Indian Defence (which would proceed by 1 c4lbf6 2 g3 g6 3 i.g2 i.g7), does he want to be committed to the fianchetto variations? And so forth. The bottom line is that when White plays 1 c4 with the inten- tion of 1...e5 2 g3, he has to consider whether to accept the transposition 1 c4 lbf6 2 lbc3 e5, enter into 1 c4 lbf6 2 lbf3, or be prepared for variations outside the traditional scope of the English Opening. Having said all that, here are some concrete considerations that might go into a decision about whether to play 2 g3 after 1 c4 e5.
1 c4 e5 2 g3: Favouring White:
a) In some cases, the difference is easily seen. For example, 2 lbc3 i.b4 enjoys a good reputation, whereas 2 g3 i.b4? has nothing to recommend it! b) Similarly, with 2 g3 lbf6 3 i.g2, White sidesteps 2lbc3lbf6 3 g3 i.b4, analysed above. c) 2 g3 lbf6 3 i.g2 d5 4 cxd5 lbxd5 is a re- versed Accelerated FianchettolDragon. White has a few options apart from 5 lbc3 (which transposes to the main line). For example, he can play 5 lbf3!? lbc6 6 O-O. If Black then con- tinues 6 ... lbb6 (not forced), White can bring his queen's knight to d2 instead of c3 by means of, for example, 7 d3 i.e7 8 a3 O-O 9 lbbd2. Ulti- mately, this may not bring give White an advan- tage, but it's a different and legitimate way of playing. We'll see it below. d) In some lines, there is no knight on c3 that can be attacked by ... d4. This occurs prom- inently in the variation 1 c4 e5 2 g3 lbf6 3 i.g2 c6 4 d4 exd4 5 ~xd4 d5 6 cxd5 cxd5 7 lbf3 lbc6 8 ~a4, as opposed to 1 c4 e5 2lbc3lbf6 3 g3 c6 4 d4 exd4 5 ~xd4 d5 6 cxd5 cxd5 7 lbf3 lbc6 8 ~a4 d4 (attacking the knight on c3).
1 c4 e5 2 g3: Favouring Black:
a) As we've seen in Chapter 3, the sequence 2lbc3 f5 allows 3 d4!. But after 2 g3, 2 ... f5 has fewer drawbacks for Black, and 2 g3 d6 3 i.g2 f5 eliminates most lines in which White plays an early lbf3 and d4. Whether this should worry White is open to debate. b) The move-order 2 g3 c6 can present unique problems for White. In particular, 3 d4 i.b4+ is increasingly popular, and the similar 2 g3 lbf6 3 i.g2 c6 4 d4 i.b4+ usually trans- poses. Obviously this strategy isn't available to Black after 2lbc3.
92 MASTERING THE CHESS OPENINGS
c) Furthennore, following 2 g3 c6 3 tbf3 e4 4 tbd4 dS S cxdS, Black can recapture with his queen (S ... 'iVxdS), as he can in the line 2 g3 tbf6 3 i.g2 c6 4 tbf3 e4 S tbd4 dS 6 cxdS 'iVxdS (D). w Again, 2 tbc3 eliminates this possibility. See below for details. d) Another difference between 2 g3 and 2 tbc3 is that 2 g3 tbc6 3 i.g2 g6 followed by ... i.g7 almost always gives Black a Closed English variation (reversed Closed Sicilian) of Chapter 6, which is very popular among 1.. .eS players. In that case it's difficult for White to avoid 4 tbc3 i.g7, which is then the main line. But if White uses the move-order 1 c4 eS 2 tbc3 tbc6, he has the extra possibility of 3 tbf3, when 3 ... tbf6 is a main-line Four Knights Vari- ation (see below), whereas 3 ... g6 and 3 .. .fS can be answered by 4 d4 (or 4 e3), in both cases cir- cumventing the Closed English. There are a few more issues, and it may take some independent investigation to be sure that you're comfortable with 2 g3. Gulko - Korchnoi Hastings 1988/9 lc4eS2g3fS A simple attempt to grab space and control e4. Unfortunately, there's no space to cover all of the alternatives with their transpositions, most notably 2 ... d6 and 2 ... tbc6. A few starternotes: a) 2 ... d6 is ultra-flexible, and keeps open options of ... fS, ... c6 and ... g6; for example, 3 i.g2 fS (or 3 ... tbc6) 4 d4, and now even the elastic move 4 ... i.e7 is possible, when the ex- change of queens is harmless. b) 2 ... tbc6, as mentioned above, virtually en- sures a Closed Sicilian or other respectable line; for example, 3 i.g2 g64 tbc3 i.g7. Here 3 .. .fS!? 4 tbc3 tbf6 is a tempo-down Sicilian Grand Prix Attack, when S e3 discourages both S ... i.cs be- cause of 6 tbge2 and S ... i.b4 due to 6 tbdS. 3i.g2 In the previously-examined case of 2 tbc3 fS 3 d4, Black was pretty much limited to 3 ... e4 and 3 ... exd4, both playable, but arguably leav- ing White with some advantage. But after 2 g3 fS 3 d4!? (D), there are new possibilities.
B
One is 3 ... d6; this is better than in the 2 tbc3 fS 3 d4 d6 case, if only because 4 dxeS dxe5 5 ~xd8+ isn't as effective when White has spent a move on g3.

Here Black has an excellent pawn-structure, so the issue is whether White can upset the balance, usually with rapid development and a pawn- break. Under normal circumstances, the two tempi spent on g3 and iLg2 aren't ideal for ac- complishing this, so Black shouldn't have too many problems. A sample line is 9ltJc3 '3;e7 10 O-O-O c6 11 ltJf3?!

I'm going to emphasize this move because it leads to basic types of positions, including those with the isolated queen's pawn and with an ad- vanced centre. To begin with, Black threatens simply 3 ... dS. Again, we have the odd case in which Black is playing a tempo down compared with 1 e4 cS 2 c3, and one would think that White could take advantage of this. But the g3 move can be a mixed blessing for White, as seen in this and the next games. We'll leave some questions of move-order until later, specifically of the choice between 2 ... c6 and 2 ... ltJf6 3 iLg2 c6, which very often transpose. 3d4 Following 3 iLg2 dS 4 cxdS cxdS S d4, both S ... e4 and S. .. exd4 6ltJf3 iLb4+ 7 iLd2 iLcs are satisfactory answers if one knows the theory. This might not fit Black's designs, however, so he sometimes chooses 3 ... ltJf6, when 4ltJc3 dS! returns to the Keres Defence section and 4 d4 iLb4+ is discussed in later games.

3 ... exd4 It's always hard to know when Black can play the cramping advance ... e4. If White has B played both g3 and i.g2, Black can often pro- tect e4 and make the bishop on g2 look ineffec- tive.

So perhaps 4 ... dS is a satisfactory move after all. Another promising sign is that the obvious S4Jh3 is relatively harmless after the surprising S. .. dxc4! 64Jxe4 i.b4+.

Of course, there's much more to be said about S ... liJa6, and White needn't despair of finding interesting ways to try for advantage. 5 iLg2 Without descending too far into the morass of move-order issues, White often plays S liJf3 here, although that permits S ... dxc4 with fair chances for equality. 5 ••• iLe6 Black could play S ... dxc4, but decides to go in another direction and force White's hand. 6 exd5 exd5 7 liJf3liJe6 S 'liVa4 iLe5!

See how the picture has transformed: White has a weak isolated pawn, a bad bishop, and a vulnerable kingside, whereas Black has a knight ensconced on the forward outpost d4. Now 23 llxd4? loses to 23 ... 'iVb6. For all that, White does have a useful pin on the d-file to work with. The game continued 23 'it>hl 'iVf6 24 e5! (White solves two of his problems in one shot!

Going all the way back to 1O ... .l:Ie8, White should probably reject 11 e3 and take a chance with the natural 11 lbc3!. Then the rook on e8 isn't ideally placed (in comparison with the main lines) unless Black can make something tactical like ll...d4 12 .l::!.adl .ltd7 work.

Simply put, he has got rid of his f8-bishop and then placed his central pawns on dark squares, leaving the 'good' c8-bishop on the board. The pawn on e5 secures a foot- hold in the centre, and Black retains the option of playing ... exd4, ... d5, or ... e4. In return, White has his own healthy share of the centre. His bishop on g2 is also 'good', as- suming that he plays e3. Or, if White chooses e4 instead, he gains the traditional space advan- tage conferred by pawns on e4 and d4 versus e5 and d6 (aided by the pawn on c4). Finally, Black has the only weak central point, that is, d6. 7lLlc3 White can try to anticipate the coming at- tack on his c-pawn by playing 7 e3 first. Then 7 ... i.e6 8 b3 exd4 9 exd4 d5 10 c5!?

White probably has some advantage; he can attempt to expand on either wing following, say, lbc1-d3. For his part, Black has the stan- dard Old Indian idea of playing ... hS-h4 in con- junction with a knight on g6; if in tum White plays h4, he will only achieve a later f4 at the cost of weakening g4 and h4.

Then Black has two attractive moves: a) 9 ... i.c5 with the elementary idea 10 O-O? (10 d4 exd3 11 'iYxd3 WIIxd3 12 exd3 i.e6; 10 M! i.b6 11 a4looks best) 1O ... i.xh3 11 i.xh3??

Nevertheless, White has certain advantages, in that Black's queen can be kicked around with tempo, perhaps twice (fIrst by lbc3 and then by one or more of the advances d4, f4, or even g4).

104 MASTERING THE CHESS OPENINGS
Because of White's move-order, Black can try to keep his knight in the centre for a long time by playing 6 ... iLe7 (D). w One interesting consequence is that if White continues with the set-up we are considering (d3 and tDbd2), Black's knight remains on its best square; for example, 7 d3 O-O 8 a3 as 9 b3 (9 tDbd2 iLe6) 9 ... iLe6 10 iLb2 f6 11 tDbd2 'ilVd7 was very comfortable for Black in Carl- sen-Gelfand, Moscow (blitz) 2007. Thus, if White doesn't want to revert to the conventional Dragon set-up by 7 tDc3, he should play 7 d4, when the main line is 7 ... e4 8 tDeS fS 9 tDxc6 bxc6 (D). At this point there's quite a bit of theory, so I'll simply list some abbreviated lines: a) 10 'ilVa4 is played more often than other moves. The conventional solution is 1O ... 'ilVd7, with the idea of ... cS. Topalov-Timman, Wijk aan Zee 1999 went 11 .l:i.d1 cS! 12 'ilVxd7+ iLxd7 13 dxcS iLe6! and the game was level. b) Carlsen-Gelfand, Moscow (blitz) 2007 went 10 tDc3 O-O 11 f3!? exf3 12 exf3?! (12 l:lxf3 followed by e4 is equal) 12 ... iLf6 13 .l:!.el .nb8. This is quite awkward for White. c) 10 tDd2 is a good try, although several an- swers are reasonable. Black can play conven- tionally by 10 ... O-O 11 tDb3 iLa6 12 .l:!.e1 .l:!.b8. Alternatively, 1O ... iLe6 11 tDb3 O-O 12 iLd2 'iWb8!? with the idea ... ~bS is a clever option. Lastly, for the fanatic, there's 1O ... hS!? 11 tDb3 (11 h4!? O-O) ll...h4, with ... h3 and ... iLa6 in re- serve. All of this should be subjected to scrutiny. d) 10 f3 exf3 11 iLxf3 O-O 12 tDc3 iLe6 and now 13 ~a4 tDb6 14 ~xc6 iLd7 with a repeti- tion of position was Gulko-Harikrishna, Wijk aan Zee 2001. Instead, Sher-Smirin, Moscow 1990 went 13 e4 fxe4 14 tDxe4, and 14 ... ~d7 would have been the obvious move, with the idea IS .l:!.f2 .l:!.ae8.

Nevertheless, the am- bitious 13 e31? has been employed more often. White aims for d4, but it's hard for him to im- prove upon the following lengthy, almost forced, book sequence: 13 ... ~fd8 14 d4 exd4 IS tiJxd4 tiJxd4 16 i.xd4 cSl 17 i.xcS (17 i.c3 a4!) 17 ...

3 •.. lLlc6 Now that we've seen the theory of 3 g3, the motivations behind 3 lLlf3 should be easier to understand. First, it's more forcing and there- fore restricts the opponent's options. Black's usual response is to protect his e-pawn by 3 ... lLlc6, when he has forfeited the possibility of ... c6, a move that plagued White in our pre- vious chapter in the variations stemming from both 2 g3 and 2lLlc3lLlf6 3 g3. Furthermore, in lines with ... lLlc6 and ... .i.b4, White's lLld5 will tend to be more effective, not only be- cause a counter with ... c6 isn't on the cards, but because ... lLlxd5 tends to lose a tempo after the recapture cxd5. As always, such advantages come with dis- advantages. By playing 3 lLlf3, White encour- ages ... e4 with tempo, and indeed that move is key to Black's play in many of the most impor- tant variations. Furthermore, White foregoes the development by lLlge2 (or lLlh3), reducing the likelihood that he will attack Black's centre byf4. Why 3 ... lLlc6? Simply because the e-pawn needs protection and the only other serious moves are 3 ... e4 and 3 ... d6. After some experi- ence with the gambit 3 ... e4?! 4lLlg5 b5!? (else the e-pawn falls for nothing), it turns out that declining the pawn sacrifice by 5 d3! secures a pleasant advantage based upon White's central control and development. The relevant analysis can be found in various books. Defence of the e-pawn by 3 ... d6 is primarily a transpositional device; for example, after 4 d4 lLlbd7, 5 e4 will transpose to either an Old In- dian Defence, if Black plays 5 ... .i.e7, or to a King's Indian Defence if Black plays 5 ... g6. The game stays within English Opening terri- tory after 4 d4 e4 5 lLlg5 .i.f5, which was ana- lysed in Chapter 3 under the move-order 1 c4 e5 2lLlc3 d6 3 lLlf3 lLlf6 4 d4 e4 5lLlg5 .i.f5. In any case, 3 ... d6 forfeits the chance to play ... .i.b4 or ... d5 (at least in one step); those moves are two of Black's main weapons versus 3 g3. The position after 3 ... lLlc6 (D) is called the 'English Four Knights Variation', and is a tradi- tional main line. w The first question is whether White can prof- itably play the thematic pawn-break 4 d4 (see beloW). That move has undergone a modest re- vival; although the conventional wisdom is that Black achieves equality, the debate goes on. Then we have a series of less dramatic choices for White on his 4th move such as 4 d3, 4 e3 and 4 g3. Black has many possible responses to all of these, but an intriguing question is whether he can afford to enter a reversed Open Sicilian
FOUR KNIGHTS VARIATION 107
(1 e4 cS 2 lLlf3 lLlc6 3 d4 cxd4 4 lLlxd4) by play- ing 4 ... dS S cxdS lLlxdS. Two issues arise: a) Which of White's fourth moves will be useful versus ... dS and productive in its own right? b) Is Black's position in the normal Open Sicilian so compelling that when White plays it with an extra tempo, it will propel him to the advantage? That is, if White simply plays a use- ful 'Sicilian' move such as 4 a3, 4 d3 or 4 g3, will 4 ... dS S cxdS lLlxdS allows him a lasting edge? Or, if Black plays safely, are White's prospects strictly limited? We've asked this question before about analogous positions in Chapters 2, 3 and 4. In general, 3 lLlf3 is more popular than 3 g3 because Black has a much harder time proving equality, and can easily end up with the small disadvantage that we associate with moving second. After 3 ... lLlc6, let's look at games with a va- riety of fourth moves, beginning with some less conventional ones. Slower White Approaches 4a3 Korchnoi - Salov St Petersburg 1997 White reasons that ... a6 is a handy move in al- most every Sicilian Defence, so it makes sense to try it for White. a) 4 b3 can't be too bad, but isn't very force- ful. Perhaps the easiest response is 4 ... g6 fol- lowed by ... iLg7 and ... O-O. In fact, the obvious 4 ... dS S cxdS lLlxdS 6 iLb2 lLlxc3 7 iLxc3 iLd6
8 d3 O-O also equalizes.
b) 4 d3 (D) is a common choice, but too slow to pose a real challenge to Black because it forfeits the chance to play d4 in one move. bl) As against other quiet moves, the all- purpose 4 ... g6 is satisfactory, leading to the King's Indian/Closed hybrid of Chapter 12 if play continues S g3 iLg7 6 iLg2 O-O 7 O-O d6. b2) Black also frequently chooses 4 ... iLM with the idea of an early ... e4 and/or ... dS. S iLd2 O-O and now: b21) 6 g3 may not inspire, but gives chances for a slight edge after 6 .. J:te8 7 iLg2 iLxc3 8

Notice also that the ag- gressive 6 ... lLld4!? with the idea ... lLlxf3+ and ... c6 has held its own in practice. b22) One high-level example is 6 e3 ne8 7 ~c2!? iLxc3 8 iLxc3 dS 9 cxdS lLlxdS 10 iLe2 iLfS! 11 l:tdl (Black's tactical point is 11 e4 lLlf4! 12 exfS lLld4!) ll...aS 12 O-O file7 with equality, Ehlvest-Kasparov, Reykjavik 1988. b3) If Black doesn't want to go in those di- rections, he can also answer 4 d3 more ambi- tiously by playing a reversed Open Sicilian with 4 ... dS S cxdS lLlxdS. This is an extremely instructive position to investigate by substitut- ing various normal Sicilian moves for White at this juncture. For example, 6 e4!? (D) is like a Sveshnikov Sicilian in reverse.
B
White's problem again has to do with his ex- tra move, in this case d3. In the reversed lines,
108 MASTERING THE CHESS OPENINGS
Black has the aggressive move ... i.b4 if White's d4-knight retreats. Here, because of White's extra move d3, the development i.bS is not available. A typical line goes 6 ... ttJb6 (6 ... ttJf6 is also perfectly satisfactory; for example, 7 i.e2 i.g4 8 O-O i.xf3!? 9 i.xf3 ttJd4, Moroze- vich-Grishchuk, World Ch, Mexico City 2007; and even 6 ... ttJxc3 7 bxc3 i.cs isn't bad) 7 i.e2 i.e7 80-00-09 a4 i.e6! 10 i.e3 (10 as ttJd7) 1O ... ttJd7 (anyway!) 11 d4 exd412 ttJxd4 ttJxd4 13 ~xd4 c6 14 as ttJcS IS ~eS ttJb3 16 l:l.a4 i.d6 17llVhs g6 18 ~6 i.eS with full equality, Carlsen-Topalov, MorelialLinares 2008. Of course, White has options apart from 6 e4 in the position after 4 d3 dS S cxdS ttJxdS. 6 g3 is a Reversed Dragon, which we'll see below; and 6 e3 is a reversed Scheveningen. But in general, when playing with this d3/e3 pawn- structure, White has more chance of gaining the advantage if he can place his queen' s knight on d2; you might compare the N ajdorf Variation of the Sicilian with its extraordinarily effective knight on d7. In our line, with White's knight on c3, Black should be able to equalize, but you might want to confirm this for yourself. Let's return to the main game with 4 a3 (D).
B
4 .•• g6 Broadly speaking, if ... i.b4 isn't possible, then ... g6 will be a good alternative. It makes sense against any slow move like 4 a3. Other moves: a) Black can also treat White's whole idea with disdain and play 4 ... dS S cxdS ttJxdS (D) anyway. Confronted with the 'extra' move a3, Black may not want to attack as White does in an w Open Sicilian position, preferring to look for simplifying ideas that yield equality. White, on the other hand, already has the central majority. Let's look at a few continuations: al) 6 e3 has several good answers. First, 6 ... i.e7 7 i.bs1Wd6!? is effectively a tempo up for Black on a line we've seen via the move- order 2 ttJc3 ttJf6 3 e3 in Chapter 4, because 4 a3 has proven irrelevant. A more provocative course for Black in this variation is to try the gambit that White plays with reversed colours, that is, 7 ... O-O!? 8 i.xc6 bxc6 9 ttJxeS i.d6! with the idea 10 ttJxc6 1Wgs. It's unlikely that White's pawn being on a3 helps him much. Finally, Black can playa Four Knights Sicilian in reverse by 6 ... ttJxc3 7 bxc3 e4 8 ttJd4 ttJeS, when the pawn on a3 even prevents the stan- dard idea i.a3. In each case, you'd have to compare the reversed positions concretely to be sure of what the differences are. a2) 6 e4 is a Sveshnikov without the possi- bility of 6 ... ttJdb4, but as above, White's posi- tion after the unexciting 6 ... ttJb6 is probably not helped by the weakening move a3. Further- more, Black can play the forcing 6 ... ttJf4 7 d4 exd4 8 i.xf4 dxc3 9 bxc3 1Wf6 (9 ... ~xdl + 10 Itxdl i.xa3 is also possible due to the pawn on a3) 10 1Wd2 i.g4 11 eS 'iVe6.

Ji..g7. Black's move-order has the advantage that S d4 can be answered by S. .. e4 6 liJgS Ji..f5. Com- pare the 2 ... d6Iines in Chapter 3; here White's move a3 is not useful. We now return to 4 ... g6 (D): w 5 d4 Usually the best answer to the move ... g6 is to counter directly like this (or to play e3 and d4). Here the effectiveness of S d4 is somewhat reduced because a3 has become irrelevant. I mentioned the dubious move S b4? in Chapter 4 (via 2 liJc3 liJf6 3 a3, etc.).

... liJxd4!? Korchnoi proposes 1O ... dS. This is a dynamic tactical device that you should look for in simi- lar positions (whether from the King's Indian or Modem Defence, for example), especially if ... gS is possible for Black. The primary points are that 11 liJxd5 is inferior due to 11...gS 12 liJxf6+ (12 Ji..g3liJxd5 13liJxc6 bxc6 14 cxdS iLxb2) 12 ... iLxf6 13liJxc6 bxc6, and 11 cxd5 is also ineffective after 11...liJxd4 12 exd4 gS with the idea 13 Ji..g3 liJxdS 14 O-O c5!? (or 14 ... c6). This sequence works because White hasn't castled and every move by Black has been directly aggressive. Of course, White isn't that badly off, and can play 11 liJxc6 bxc6 12 cxdS cxdS, with chances for both sides. 11 exd4 g5 Again, 11.. .dS! was a good move. 12 iLg3liJe4 13 O-O d6 14 iLd3!

A fascinating move which looks ridiculous because it creates a big hole on d4. But the weakness is compensated for by the control that White has over dS and the consequent

difficulty that Black faces in freeing his game. In practice, White can slowly work around the centre, usually by playing g3, i.g2 and O-O, and then aiming to achieve f4. Black's task is to exploit the d4 outpost or otherwise chal- lenge White's centre.
4. .. i.h4
The other established variation goes 4 ... i.c5 5ltJxe5! (else after 5 ... d6, White's pawn-struc- ture looks rather silly) 5 ... ltJxe5 6 d4 i.b4 7 dxe5ltJxe4 8 'iVd4ltJxc3 9 bxc3 (D).

Now 9 ... i.e7 is supposed to be about equal after 10 'iVg4 Rf8 11 'iVg3 d6, but White has some interesting and untried options such as 10 i.d3 0-0110-0 d6 12 i.f4. Black's alternative is 9 ... i.a5 10 i.a3 d6 11 exd6 O-O 12 O-O-O cxd6 13 'iVxd6!? (13 i.xd6l:te8 14 i.d3) 13 ... 'iVxd6 14 i.xd6 J:le8 15 Rb2 i.d7 16 i.d3 i.c6 17 f3, an ending that has arisen in some top-level games. Black should be able to work his way to a draw with extremely accurate play, but the average mortal will probably be unsatisfied with this.
5 d3 d6 6 g3
6 a3 simply pushes Black to where he wants
to go after 6 ... i.c5 7 b4 i.b6. 6 i.e2 is playable but non-threatening. 6 ... h6 Probably not the optimal solution to the po- sition, but it does prevent a piece from going to g5. Black has other ideas such as 6 ... O-O and 6 ... i.c5, leading to complex positional strug- gles. For example, 6 ... i.c5 7 i.g2ltJd4 8ltJxd4 i.xd4, as in Gulko-Karpov, Reykjavik 1991, leaves White a choice of plans: ltJe2 followed by d4 (assuming the bishop retreats from d4), or implementing the pawn-break f4. Theory considers this line to be equal. The logical 6 ... i.g4 is consistent with the theme of controlling White's weak square d4. An excellent illustration of both sides' ideas was Bu Xiangzhi-Bacrot, Turin Olympiad 2006:
7 h3 i.xf3 8 'iVxf3 ltJd4 9 'iVdl c6 10 i.g2 O-O
11 O-O i.c5! (retreating the bishop to c5 is typi-
cal, and why not? Once Black has sidestepped 4 ... i.c5 5 ltJxe5, the bishop can return to its ideal post) 12 ~h2 (D) (12ltJa4 'iVe7 13ltJxc5?! dxc5 leaves White's d-pawn as a target down the open file).
B
A representative position from this variation. The combination of ... i.g4xf3 and ... i.c5 has cemented control over d4, whereas White has opportunities based upon kingside expansion: 12 ... a5 13 f4 b5!? 14 f5 b4 15 ltJa4ltJd7!? (or 15 ... i.a7) 16ltJxc5 dxc5 (16 ... ltJxc5 17 f6!) 17 g4 f6 18 h4 h6 19 i.d2 ~f7!. The king escapes to the centre and frustrates attacking plans by White. The game was logically drawn. 7 i.g2 i.xc3+?!
FOUR KNIGHTS VARIATION 111
This exchange is rather cooperative, giving White the bishops and eliminating d4 as an outpost. While this pawn-structure may be ac- ceptable for Black, he has trouble finding counterplay. One alternative is 7 ... i.g4, again retaining the option of ... i.cS. 8 bxe3 i.e6 9 lbd2! White has two ideas: he can continue lbfl- e3 and lbdS or lbfS, a manoeuvre not possible after O-O; and by keeping his king in the centre he can neutralize Black's potential attack by ... 'iVd7, ... hS-h4 and/or ... lbh7-gS. Still, castling and combining ideas of lbh4-fS and f4 is also a reasonable strategy. 9 ... hS 10 l:i.bl b6 11 h4lbd7 12lbn lbe7 13 lbe3 f614 d4! (D)

The type of position that White is aiming for. His pieces have wonderful range and Black's knight is restricted by the f4-pawn, whereas the pawns on c3 and c4 are safe from attack.

For a long time this safe move was quite pop- ular, since it prepares the highly desirable ad- vance d4.

Finally we arrive at the move that most grand- masters play. White's idea should be obvious by now: to control the hl-a8 diagonal, get castled, and attack in the centre or on the queenside. Out of an enormous mass of games and theory, I shall emphasize material with recurring posi- tional and tactical themes. 4 ••• .J1l.cS Although 4 ... .J1l.b4 has dominated high-level play, and 4 ... dS is also popular, 4 ... .ltcS is logi- cal and has had good success. If White plays positionally, he can gain a slight central advan- tage, but only by giving Black's pieces active squares in return. S ttJxeS!? Many players have found this radical solu- tion to be more to their taste than the calmer alternative S .J1l.g2, when Black has generally held his own over the years. After that move follows S ... d6 6 O-O O-O (D). w Then White has two main (and sometimes similar) approaches: a) 7 d3 a6 (7 ... h6 is fully playable but un- necessary) 8 .J1l.gS (8 e3 is slow and gives Black time to consolidate; for example, 8 ... h6 9 b3 .J1l.a7 10 .J1l.b2 :b8! 11 h3 bS 12 :c1 .J1l.d7, Gulko-Wolff, USA Ch, Modesto 1995; the idea of ... :b8 and ... bS is a recurring theme and pre- vents White from undertaking anything aggres- sive for fear of Black opening lines by ... bxc4) 8 ... h6 9 .J1l.xf6 (9 .J1l.h4!? hopes for 9 ... gS 10 ttJxgS! with a strong attack, but 9 ... ttJd4 10 .J1l.xf6 'iWxf6 11 ttJe4 'iWe7 12 ttJxcS dxcS is a sound structure because of Black's restraint of d4, Onishchuk-Sadler, Elista Olympiad 1998) 9 ...

White's dilemma is that the moves dS and dxeS both extend the range of the bishop on a7. Right away, Black would like to play 9 ... i.g4, putting pressure on d4, so 9 h3 is usually played.

For many years this move was entirely ig- nored, since it isolates White's e-pawn. Now it has put some players off 4 ... i.cS altogether! White's idea is simply to get his pieces out while exerting pressure down the d-file and maintaining a space advantage. White has various slower moves. He can play 8 i.e2, for example, covering g4. For his part, Black can insert ... O-O and/or ... a6 before committing to ... d6. However, it turns out that the positional themes tend to be similar regard- less of move-order, so I'm only going to look at the traditional main line 8 d3 (8 h3 d6 9 d3 will transpose) 8 ... d6 (D). Black's obvious intent is to control the out- post on d4, at the same time using the pseudo- outpost on eS for his pieces. White wishes to develop as actively as possible and use his good bishop to make threats, normally in conjunc- tion with play down the f-file and/or a break with M. In addition, he has an outpost on dS,
122 MASTERING THE CHESS OPENINGS
which in comparison with Black's on d4 is somewhat difficult to make use of, because he hasn't another piece to support it. White generally covers g4 first by 9 h3, and after 9 ... O-O, Black has a number of possible plans, but the time-tested idea of ... ttJe8-c7-e6 almost always seems a good remedy.

Along with the two bish- ops and pressure against Black's weak d-pawn, the open f-file and outpost on d5 can come in handy. It's worth noting, however, that Black has his own trumps, most importantly a won- derful knight on an outpost square that is in front of an isolated pawn on an open file! Fur- thermore, his remaining bishop is a good one, which can exert pressure on that weak e-pawn. In those respects, his position resembles a Sicil- ian Defence. Notice that Black's two knights, rook and queen are poised to maintain a piece on e5 after exchanges, whereas White some- times has to recapture with a pawn in response to a piece exchange on d5. Although White can exert a degree of pressure in this position, I think that it is acceptable for Black.

w As in other variations of the English Four Knights, 4 ... ~b4 is the theoretically most ad- vanced and complex answer to 4 g3. Some people consider it the main line of the entire Reversed Sicilian, which is hard to argue with. As we see with other lines involving ... ~b4, the simple development of a bishop spawns an as- tonishing number of unique situations. My aim is to find unity where I can by relating similar structures. 5~g2 For reasons of space, I'm going to forego a treatment of the moves 5 ljjd5 and 5 ~g2 O-O 6 ljjd5. Some specialists use one or the other, pri- marily as a way to steer clear of main lines and perhaps to play with less risk as White. This may come at the cost of reducing one's winning chances, because according to current theory Black has some fairly clear solutions that per- mit him to equalize without too much trouble. That is not to say that he shouldn't study these lines in order to be prepared, nor that White won't want to investigate them for potential use as a surprise weapon. 5 ••• 0-060-0 At this point Black's main moves are 6 .. J:te8 and 6 ... e4. In fact, other moves are legitimate, and the subtleties of move-order, including transpositions, are too complicated to go into here (nor are they well covered in theory books). But I think that it's worth thinking about the ef- fects of playing 6 ... ~xc3 (D), which is a rea- sonably good move in and of itself, but also a very instructive one. w Black's two recaptures illustrate the overlap of this ... ~b4 system with earlier ones in this book: a) After 7 dxc3, 7 ... e4 8ljjel transposes to a main line below, but here Black can play solidly by 7 ... d6, when White will have difficulties breaking down Black's centre. For example, 8 "fic2 (White wants to get e4 in; the alternative 8 ljjel ~e6 9 b3 'ilVd7 10 ljjc2 ~h3 llljje3 ~xg2 12 'it>xg2ljje7 gives Black at least equality; for

w White lacks a d-pawn to attack in the centre, and playing f4 at some point may come up short after ... exf4, since so many black pieces can be trained against e4. This kind of position can fairly be called equal. b) Thus the recapture 7 bxc3 is generally pre- ferred. Then Black can play 7 ... e4 (for 7 ... .l:!.e8, see below). In doing so, he agrees to 8 lZ)g5 l:!.e8, transposing to a main line considered later, but he has prevented White from playing some of the effective lZ)el lines below, since now 8lZ)el d5 9 cxd5 'iVxd5 is fully satisfactory for Black. The main drawback to this move- order is that White can play 8lZ)d4, possibly en- tering into a notorious and important line that goes 8 ... .:te8 (8 ... d5 should definitely be con- sidered, when 9 d3! isn't clear) 9 d3 h6!?

What a strange idea! White reduces his con- trol of d4 and e5, while taking two extra moves

to land on the uninspiring c2-square. OK, then White attacks the b4-bishop, but as we have re- peatedly seen, Black is going to play ... ~xc3 anyway. What's the point? For one thing, White's bishop on g2 is unmasked, covering the key e4- and d5-squares. If, after ... ~xc3, White opens the d-file by dxc3, a subsequent ~g5 and ttJe3 will strengthen that pressure. Before turning to 7 ttJel, here are the open- ings of two other famous games involving other logical responses to 6 ... ne8: a) Petrosian-Gheorghiu, Moscow 1967 went

White's knight has gone from gl to c3 in four moves! As a result, we have arrived at a typical English Opening position, in which the emphasis is upon exploitation of the long diag- onal above all else. Black would normally be ahead in development, but he too has expended time in playing ... h6 and ... ~M-f8, whereas the rook on e8 might be better-placed on f8 anyway, to support .. .f5. The game continued 12 ... ~d7 13 b4! fVc8 14 nbl ~h3 15 e4! (a re- markable move! It's not so strange to put one's pawns on light squares if the g2-bishop is coming off the board, but White does so at the cost of granting Black a ready-made outpost on d4; the point is revealed by moves 17 and 18) 15 ... ~xg2 (15 ... ~e6 16 ~e3 ~e7 17 f4! is the other idea behind 15 e4) 16 'it>xg2 g6 17 h4! ~g7 18 h5! g5 19 ttJd5 ttJd4 20 ttJe3 f5 21 ~b2!, and White has won the crucial f5-square, dooming Black's bishop to passivity.

The ttJel-c2-e3 manoeuvre is employed in most situations involving dxc3 and ... e4. What wasn't realized for some time was how much more powerful this set-up is when White has had the opportunity for ~g5 and ~xf6. Black will have considerable difficulty protecting his e-pawn, and the idea of a timely ttJd5 keeps Black off balance. 12•.• l:i.e5 One of White's main ideas is f4, and in the case of 12 ... ~f5 13 f4! it is particularly strong, threatening g4. 13 ~b3! l:tb8 14 nadl b6 15 ~c2 ~f5?! 16 nd5!

w You can almost count upon a unique game in this variation because both sides have so many positionally sound options. Black has tried at least five logical moves here, with a similar choice on the following move, so transpositions abound. Common continuations have been l1...b6, 11....l:te5, l1...ttJe5 (a gambit, with the idea 12 .1xe4 ttJxe4 13 ~xe4 ttJg4) , and the game move. A sequence like 11.. .. 1d7 12 .1d2 a5 13 .l:tael epitomizes White's preferred plan: the slow build-up for f4.

... iVf6?! This is a move that has been tried in several similar positions. Black wants to connect rooks and target some interior weaknesses on e3 or d3 (following ... 'iYfS, for example). Nevertheless, Black's knight can be driven to an inferior square and in some cases the queen can be ex- posed to attack. The more accurate order seems to be 16 ... d6! 17 f4 tiJd7 18 i.b2 'iYf6, and Black has equal play based upon the idea ... tiJcS.

A move worth noting. The rook travels to the centre, and the bishop on c 1 stays on what is arguably its best square.

.Jig2 O-O 6 O-O e4 7 tbg5 .Jixc3 8 bxc3l:!.e8 (D) This introduces the most tactically critical variation of the 4 g3 .Jib4 English Four Knights. It's impossible to cover more than a small frac- tion of the many variations, so I'm going to show one main game with many notes of spe- cial interest. My selection of examples is meant to reflect how representative tactics and posi- tional trade-offs interact. The positions are rather unstable, however, and there is certainly no hard-and-fast rule as to where both sides should put their pieces. A correspondence game between two top players is an appropriate vehicle for examining such a theoretical varia- tion. 9f3 White challenges e4 with the f-pawn, by far the most common strategy in modem chess. It's worth looking briefly at the pawn-structure and the play that results from the older and natural 9 d3 exd3 10 exd3 (D). White has opened up his bishop's long diag- onal and kept the bishop-pair. On the other hand, his centre is relatively immobile and Black has no weaknesses. I'm not going to cover the position in any depth, but the follow- ing options seem most important: a) 1O ... d6 is solid. A logical continuation is II ~b I h6 12 tbe4 tbxe4 13 .Jixe4 tbe5 with only a faint edge for White, if any, after 14 .Jif4. b) 1O ... b6 is also sensible, when White will usually aim for d5 with his knight; for example, II tbh3.Jib7 12 tbf4 with a small advantage. A significant alternative is 11 .Jid5!? tbxd5 12 cxd5, when 12 ... h6 can lead to the drawing line 13 tbxf7!? 'it>xf7 14 ~h5+ ~g8 15 dxc6 dxc6 161i.xh6 gxh6 17 ~g6+ ~h8 18 ~xh6+ ~g8 19'iiig6+~h8 20~ael!? J.d7!, and here White should repeat! c) The best move may well be IO ... h6. Then 11 tbf3 b6 is Black's standard plan to oppose the long diagonal, but he might also consider ll...d5!? 12 cxd5 tbxd5, which is a familiar type of position in which White's central pawns are targets. White's most frequent reply to IO ... h6 is 11 tbh3, when 11...d6 is usually played. But I think that it would be consistent with similar positions in this book to open things up for the knights by 11...d5!. Then it's White who has to work to get his share of the play. For example, 12 cxd5 tbxd5 13 J.d2 tbe5! 14 d4 J.g4! 15 f3 J.xh3 16 J.xh3 tbc4 with dominant knights and weak squares in White's camp, or 12 tbf4!? dxc4 13 dxc4, and either 13 ... .Jig4 14 'iiib3 tbe5 or the simple 13 ... 'iVxdl 14 .l:f.xdl tbe5 favours Black because of White's weak light squares. Thus 9 d3 isn't terribly promising. We return to 9 f3 (D):

9 ... e3!? This is I.Zaitsev's remarkable move, made famous by Karpov's use of it versus Kasparov. The very important alternative is 9 ... exf3 10 lL'lxf3 d5, after which White has two primary choices: a) The traditional main line (condensed) af- ter 11 cxd5 goes 11..:~xd5 12 lL'ld4 ~h5 13 lL'lxc6 bxc614 e3 .i.g4 15 ~a4l:te6 (D) (the al- ternative 15 ... .i.e2 also leads to equality after 16 l:txf6 gxf6 17 .i.xc6 .i.f3 18 .i.xa8 l:txa8 19 fVh4 ~xh4). w 16 .l:i.b1 (or 16 .i.a3 .Jte2 17 !!f4lL'lg4 18 h3 lL'le5) 16 ... .Jte2.

bI) 12 ... dxc4 13 l:tb1 f5 14 g4! is Kaspa- rov's fine conception, to break down Black's grip over e4. There have been many tries for Black, but nothing looks very good. Briefly: b11) The original game Kasparov-Ivanchuk, USSR Ch, Moscow 1988 went 14 ... ~e7 15 gxf5 lL'ld6 16 lL'lg5 'iVxe2 17 .i.d5+ ~h8 18 'iVxe2 l:txe2 19 .i.f4 lL'ld8 20 .i.xd6 cxd6 21 lIbel! l:!.xe1 22l:txe1 .i.d7 23 l:te7 .i.c6 24 f6! 1-0. b12) Kasparov thinks that 14 .. .fxg4 15lL'le5 lL'ld6 16lL'lxc6 bxc6 17 e4 is best, but White has the better chances. b13) 14 ... lL'ld6!? 15 .i.g511Vd7 16lL'lh4 (Stohl suggests 16 .i.f4) 16 ... lL'lf7 (P.David-Polak, Olomouc 1995) and I think White should play 17 .Jtcl! with the idea 17 ... f4 18 l:txf4 g5 19 .l::txf7 ~xf7 20 lL'lf5 with e4 to follow. b2) 12 ... .Jtf5! seems underestimated.

The light squares are always the key to Black's play against the bishops. White has at least four logical moves here.

Natu- rally, White's pawn-structure suffers, but two bishops often become effective with shattered pawns and pawn sacrifices.

IS. •. tDc6 (D) w All right, what have we here? Black com- mands more space and his intrusive pawn on e3 interferes with White's pieces. His king is safe and his pieces are well-developed (the queen's rook can be placed aggressively on c8 or take on a useful defensive role on b8). Black may also be able to scare up some kingside chances, if only because several of White's pieces are cut off from that sector, a result of the e3-pawn 'di- viding the board in two', in Kasparov's phrase. For all that, White may stand slightly better from a theoretical point of view. His position is very elastic, in that most attempts by Black to make progress will serve White's pieces well, in particular his bishops. Given enough time, he may be able to create and exploit weak- nesses on Black's queenside, as well as open- ing lines for his queen's bishop, probably by means of c4 at some point. Of course, not all of this is necessarily achievable, and practice has yielded mixed results. I'll simply indicate a few paths.

Possibly 16 nb 1 'ilVd7 17 'iVb3 b6 18 i.b2 is better because it avoids weaknesses. On the flip side, Black can keep his bishop aggressively posted on g4 and hold forth the option of a properly-timed ... i.h3.

The move 6 ... lbb6 mirrors the Classical Dragon Sicilian, also covered in some detail in Volume 1.

If Black doesn't like to retreat with 6 ... lbb6, he has to put up with the early pawn-break d4 by White. For example, 6 ... .lte6 (White was threatening 7 lbxe5, and 6 ... .lte7 doesn't help: 7 lbxe5! lbxc3 8 .ltxc6+ bxc6 9 dxc3; further- more, after 6 ... lbxc3 7 bxc3 e4, 8lbd4lbxd4 9 cxd4 'iVxd4 10 lIbl is a promising gambit, with White a tempo ahead of a similar Sicilian line, in a position where a tempo truly counts! 8lbgl is also good, since it's not possible to protect e4 without concessions) 7 O-O .lte7 8 d4, and 8 ... lbxc3 9 bxc3 e4 can be met by 10 lbel f5 11 lbc2 with the idea f3, or 10 lbe5!? lbxe5 11 dxe5 'iVxdl 1211xdl; for example, 12 ... .ltf5 13 lId411d8 14 .lte311xd4 15 cxd4 f6 16 f4 fxe5 17 fxe5 c6 18l:tbl b6 19 llf1, Marin-Kveinys, Istanbul Olympiad 2000.

lbf3 lbc6 6 O-O lbb6 7 lbc3 i.e7 8 d3 By far the most natural and common move, but there are others: a) 8 lIbl is sometimes played in order to hurry along White's b4-b5 attack. It isn't con- sidered terribly dangerous, and Black has more than one reasonable response, including 8 ... .lte6 and 8 ... a5, but the most unique riposte is the bi- zarre-looking 8 ... g5!? (D). w Black's brute-force idea is ... g4 and ... h5-h4. That is naturally no guarantee of advantage, or even equality. But it has been successful in enough games, sometimes devastatingly so, that one wonders why White isn't using the idea versus the regular Dragon. The answer, of course, is that he has already castled! I'll leave you to the books and databases if you want fur- ther details on 8 lIbl. b) 8 a4 a5 has fallen from favour, perhaps because b4 is a 'real' outpost for Black, whereas b5 is only a temporary one. Be that as it may, 9 d3 .ltg4 is fine and may transpose to 9 a4 below, whereas Korchnoi-Chekhover, Leningrad 1955 went 9 ... .lte6 10 .lte3lbd5 (already assessed as

White has the dual ideas of ii.g5, trying to clarify his positional advantages by avoiding attack (see below), and ~dl, to enforce d4. The immediate 10 b4!? is also played, as it is in the Reversed Dragon, with White having gained the extra move ii.e3. As so often, Black can try to use the fact that he is a tempo down to his advantage, in this case by replying 1O .. .f4!? (1O ... .tf6 11 ii.c5 ~e8? 12 e4! is a standard way of grabbing the centre; White will aim for b5 and a well-timed exf5, winning the e4-square, just as Black does in the Sicilian Defence) 11 ii.xb6!?

This is not even necessarily the best move, but it shows the understanding that, once the forcing nature of the game is reduced and Black's tactical opportunities are kept under control, White has the long-term advantage in the Reversed Dragon just as Black does in the Sicilian.

Black's choice of a structure with .. .f6 has become more popular than any other. Perhaps White should be looking at this same formation in the Sicilian Defence, if only as a way to avoid enervating theoretical work. 11 ••• a5 Compare this more aggressive move with the idea of playing ... tiJd4 directly from the previous game. Here l1...tiJd4 12 tiJd2 c6 13 tiJde4 has been played a lot, having in mind some combi- nation of e3, .i.b2 and a queen move to prepare lIdl.

We can safely say that the relevant part of the opening is over. Even discounting White's errors above, Black seems able to equalize in this variation by means of natural moves. In general, the Reversed Dragon produces unbalanced positions which continue to attract master players on both sides of the board.
6 Three Knights and Closed English
The main subject of this chapter is the Closed English, which, broadly speaking, is defined by
1 c4 e5 2 lbc3 lbc6, but I use it to refer to the
lines that continue 3 g3 g6 4 .tg2 .tg7. An- other set of independent variations begins with 3 lbf3, and I'll start with those.
1 c4 e5 2 lbc3 lbc6 3 lbf3 (D)

White is willing to transpose to the English Four Knights variation after 3 ... lbf6. Other- wise, Black has two main ways to go his own way, as illustrated in the next two games, with alternatives in the notes. Three Knights Variation
3. .. g6
Yakovich - Peek Amsterdam 1995 This is called the Three Knights Variation'. Apart from 3 .. .f5 (featured below), Black's other options are unimpressive; for example, 3 ... d6 4 d4 takes the centre, and Black is also vulnerable to the advance d5. 3 ... .tc5 is well met by 4 e3! (with the idea 5 d4), after which White wins the centre with tempo; Black has the particular problem that the normal idea 4 ... d6 5 d4 .tb6 runs into 6 b4!
(D).
B
Now 7 c5 is threatened, winning the bishop, while 6 ... lbxb4? loses to 7 ~a4+ lbc6 8 d5, and the best sequence 6 ... exd4 7 exd4 as still leads to a clear advantage for White following 8 b5 lbce7 9 .td3. After 3 ... .tc5, by the way, the trick 4lbxe5!? is best met by 4 ... .txf2+! 5 ~xf2 lbxe5 6 d4 ~f6+!' This favours White after, say, 7 ~el lbg4 8 ~d3 ~f2+ 9 ~d2, but not by much. The best irregular 3rd-move option from Black's view might be 3 ... .tb4!? Then 4lbd5 e4!? and 4 ~c2 d6 5lbd5 are directions to look in. It's likely that White will come out with a modest advantage. 4d4 White takes the principled course of grab- bing the centre when it is offered him. He can also play slowly by 4 d3 or 4 g3, heading for a Closed English. More significantly, some play- ers may not feel comfortable facing 4 e3 intend- ing 5 d4. Then 4 ... .tg7 5 d4 d6 is a natural course, but Black has to be willing to play with less space if White chooses d5 soon; his main consolation is that e4 will follow at the cost of a tempo (e3-e4). The most interesting option is 4 .. .f5 5 d4 e4, which might be compared with 3 ... f5 4 d4 e4 below. In that case, Black may

w The move 3 ... f5 takes on extra significance when you realize that, apart from the slightly shaky 3 ... g6, it is the main way to bypass 3 ... ltJf6 with a transposition to the English Four Knights Variation. Since Black has played 2 ... ltJc6 in- stead of 2 ... ltJf6 3 ltJf3 ltJc6, it's likely that he is trying to steer clear of the latter position. Thus if White is happy playing against 3 .. .f5, he can use 3 ltJf3 to steer the game away from the Closed English (i.e. 2ltJc3 ltJc6 3 g3 g64 .Jtg2 ..Bg7).
142 MASTERING THE CHESS OPENINGS
4d4 Rohde - Zsu. Polgar New York 1992 White challenges the centre, in order to es- tablish a superior pawn-structure. This is easily the most significant independent continuation, because 4 d3 ttJf6 S g3 can be answered by S ... g6 (or S. .. .tb4) 6 .tg2 .tg7 7 O-O O-O, trans- posing into the Closed English section with ... fS below. 4 ... e4 (D) w In a sense Black's opening is anti-positional, because dS is under White's command, and if Black's centre is attacked by f3 he may well have to surrender his e4 strongpoint. On top of that he always has to deal with the tempo- winning advance dS. Finally, as we have seen in similar positions, Black's pawn-structure invites a white piece to land on f4, presenting further difficulties in freeing his game. It turns out that none of this is of decisive consequence, because of the specific circum- stance that White is not only losing a tempo due to the attack on his knight, but that the knight apparently has nowhere to go that doesn't in- volve further loss of time (or positional conces- sions). As a result, while White is rearranging his pieces, Black has time to get his own forces out and shore up his centre. After 4 ... e4, White has many legitimate moves. I shall only look at them very briefly, but you might want to do your own investiga- tion, and compare the position to 2 ttJc3 d6 3 ttJf3 fS 4 d4 e4 from Chapter 3. 5 ttJg5 This leap forward is White's most popular response to the attack. Notice the difference be- tween this position and 2 ttJc3 d6 3 ttJf3 fS 4 d4 e4 S ttJgS. With the pawn on d6, Black can play ultra-flexibly with ... c6 and perhaps ... ttJa6-c7, as he did there. But in this line his knight on c6 gives the game a different character. It attacks d4 (in conjunction with ... .tg7 in some lines), and can go to the useful square eS if White at- tacks it by dS. Here are some pickings from other moves: a) One might think that White could profit- ably avoid loss of time by S dS exf3 6 dxc6 fxg2 7 cxd7 + ~xd7 (7 ... .txd7 8 .txg2 c6 9 "iVb3 is a little awkward for Black) 8 "iVxd7+ .txd7 9 .txg2, but what looks like a small pull turns out not to be even that after 9 ...

b) S ttJd2 ttJf6 6 e3 is a safe line. One stan- dard solution consists of 6 ... g6 with the idea ... .tg7, since then any advance by dS extends the range of Black's bishop. But perhaps White could stir the pot by 7 g4!?, intending 7 ... ttJxg4 8 ttJdxe4 fxe4 (8 ... ~h4 9 ttJg3) 9 "iVxg4 dS 10 ~g2 with superior central control. It's an idea, anyway. c) S ttJeS!? is one of those moves that mainly aims to escape the disadvantages of the alterna- tives! White retains options of bring his queen's bishop out quickly; for example, S ... ttJxeS!?

White moves his knight four times only to return to its original square! In the meantime, Black is to move and has a lead in development. Nevertheless, White's apparently absurd ma- noeuvre is a lesson in the importance of struc- ture, because White can force a favourable transformation by playing h4 and winning ei- ther the f4-square or the h-file, when Black's king will be insecure. 8 ... .tg7 9 h4 'ii;f7?

1 c4 eS 2 lbc3lbc6 3 g3 g6 4 .tg2 .tg7 (D)
w As indicated at the beginning of the chapter, I have designated this as the starting point of the Closed English, one of the most popular of 1 c4 eS systems. It begs for comparison with the Closed Sicilian, which goes 1 e4 cS 2 lbc3 lbc6, and more often than not 3 g3 g6 (3 ... e6 is also a traditional move) 4 .tg2 .tg7. In the Closed English, White has a large number of Sth-move options, some of a similar nature and others varying radically in character. But each one of them defines a structure that Black can use against the corresponding Closed Sicilian lines (1 e4 cS 2lbc3 lbc6 3 g3 g6 4 .tg2 .tg7), and as in so many cases throughout this book, White's extra tempo is partially compensated for by Black's greater information about what his opponent is doing. Naturally, White stands better than Black does in the corresponding Closed Sicilian lines, but the play tends to be fluid and hard to assess, and the opposing forces frequently don't clash at an early stage. Thus both players have a wide variety of moves to choose from, and this variation covers an enormous amount of theoretical territory. I'll try to supply examples that overlap between as many lines as possible.

White prepares M-b5, an advance that works together with the bishop on g2 by controlling squares along its diagonal. He also removes the rook from aI, where it stands exposed to pro- spective attacks by the g7 -bishop.
8. .. O-O
This can be called the main position of the Closed English, and one of the most important for the English Opening with l...e5. It arises via a large number of move-orders beginning with either 1 c4 or 1 ttJf3; for example, 1 c4 e5 2 ttJc3 d6 3 g3 f5 4 .ltg2 ttJf6 5 d3 g6 6 ttJf3 .ltg7 7 O-O ttJc6. Or it might even transpose from a Lenin- grad Dutch Defence set-up: 1 c4 f5 2 ttJc3 ttJf6
3 g3 g6 4 .ltg2 .ltg7 5 ttJf3 d6 6 O-O e5 7 d3 O-O
8 J::!.bI ttJc6.
The strategic ideas are multifaceted, but more often than not Black works for a kingside attack. Typical moves are ... g5, .. .f4, ... ttJg6, ... ttJf5, ... .lte6 with ... 'it'd7 and ... ii.h3, and ... 'iWe8-h5. Black can also play for a central advance, usu- ally ... d5, by itself or in conjunction with ... e4. White's plans on the other side of the board include moves such as b4-b5 and c5 (with cxd6 or c6), a4-a5, 'iVb3, .lta3/b2, J::!.fc1 and ttJd2-c4. Alternatively, or additionally, White will play in the centre, usually with the pawn advance d4 or working to place a knight on d5. Turning to defensive strategies, Black often uses the move ... b6 to thwart White's pawn ad- vance c5, or he can play ... c6, perhaps with ... d5 in mind, which challenges White's efforts to lengthen the reach of his g2-bishop. White's main defensive idea on the kingside involves a timely f4, to prevent .. .f5, but there are ad hoc kingside moves that can also prove effective. Black's 8 ... O-O is a major decision. His alter- native is to insert 8 ... a5 9 a3, and then 9 ... O-O 10 M axM 11 axb4 (D).
B
We shall see this in the games below. This choice is very complicated, and in fact, it comes up often enough in various contexts that it might be compared to the 'which rook?' prob- lem that confronts chess-players in so many po- sitions. When he interpolates 8 ... a5 9 a3, Black removes his a-pawn as a potential target and opens the a-file for his rook; that comes in handy by preventing an early .lta3 and gener- ally keeping an eye on squares such as al and a2. On the other hand, after White gets orga- nized by, for example, ii.b2 and 'iVb3!iVc2, he
146 MASTERING THE CHESS OPENINGS
can win the a-file by means of l:tal, taking over the open line that he so much needs in order to make progress on the queenside. B
9 b4 h610 b5 0,e7 (D)
w 11 a4 On the face of it, White is preparing as, which might be followed by a6 or b6. That is in- deed the case, and if Black gets the blocking move ... b6 in, White would especially like to open the a-file by means of as. But equally im- portantly, he wants to play i.a3 without allow- ing Black to indirectly harass the bishop by ... a6 and ... axbS at some point. After the imme- diate 11 i.a3 i.e6, intending ... a6, he should therefore consider 12 cS!? 11 cS!? immediately is the most attractive al- ternative, because it cracks open the queenside before Black can set up defensively.

... l:tc8 Black's strategy is to play ... b6 and then switch his attention to the kingside. Alterna- tively, the unsophisticated 14 ... 'iVd7, which con- nects rooks so as not to cede the a-file, may be as good as any other move. At that point, Marin suggests that White shouldn't give up the fight for the a-line, to which end 15 'iib3 g5 16 !Ia4 intending 17 l:tfa1 is logical. The risk is that af- ter 16 ... l:txa4 17 'iVxa4 f4 18 'iVa7 b6, Black gains time for an intimidating attack. Even if that ought not to win out with accurate play (for one thing, White's queen will get to b7 and be a good defender of his kingside!), it is still dan- gerous. In the end, which side you want to play is largely a matter of taste. At any rate, the game Istratescu-Mateuta, Romanian Ch, Iasi 1999 continued 14 ...

Then White has more options than Black in terms of central breaks, and the exchange exf5 should produce an ad- vantage, but it's hard to make progress. 16l:tb3 (D) Dvoretsky awards this move a '!!' because he says that it anticipates ... i.h6. But we've seen in other openings how the exchange of a defending bishop on h6 is often disadvantageous anyway, since the benefit of eliminating White's more ef- fective bishop is cancelled by the creation of kingside weaknesses. Furthermore, simplifica- tion favours the side with the space advantage in such positions, and strengthens White's direct attack on c7. 16 ••. i.h6?! Thus Black should consider 16 ... c5! 17 i.e3!

Black can also seek to punish 5 e3 directly by playing ... h5, intending simply ... h4, a strat- egy always to be aware of in a position with a fianchettoed king's bishop. I'm going to spend some time on this move, because it both typifies a flank attack that isn't represented elsewhere in this book and illustrates how someone using even the most conservative of set-ups (5 e3, 6 tbge2 and 7 d4 or 7 d3) must nevertheless con- tend with radical imbalances.

162 MASTERING THE CHESS OPENINGS
The justification for this move does not con- sist entirely in Black's attacking chances, but also in the fact that the h-pawn advance will take advantage of the light squares weakened by the conjunction of g3 and e3. As so often in chess, a flank advance serves to keep the centre under control, and has the side benefit of gain- ing space. From White's point of view, it is en- couraging to see Black using time that could be spent on development, and one should always be cognisant that pawn advances imply weak- nesses on the wing where the advance takes place. How both sides react to and resolve these conflicting factors is best seen by example. 7d4 Surely the most critical response to an ad- vance with ... h5 is a counter advance in the cen- tre. But White has alternatives: a) Both here and in several other variations (such as S e4 d6 6 ttJge2 hS!?), White can halt Black's advance by playing h4 in order to do away with the issue of dealing with Black open- ing lines on the kingside. However, you could make the case that Black gets more use out of the g4-square than White does from gs. As we shall see, that's initially so, but in the long run that depends very much upon the specific ways in which play develops. Thus 7 h4, and then: al) 7 ... ttJh6 is flexible, eyeing both fS and g4; the drawback is that it cedes piece control over dS. a2) A familiar positional trick occurs after 7 ... ttJge7 8 d3 .Bg49 ~bUtb8 iOb4a611 a4!? As we have seen elsewhere, Black has 11.. .as! 12 bS ttJb4. Now, as usual, 13 .Ba3 cS gives Black his share of queenside influence and strengthens his control of dS.

Black's point is 27 exd4 b3, winning massive amounts of material. a3) 7 ... .Bg4 8 d3 (8 b4!?, as played in Seira- wan-Kriventsov, USA Ch, Seattle 2002, should be answered boldly by 8 ... ttJxb4 9 'iVa4+ ttJc6 10 .r.:tbl .Bc8!, when the paradoxical 11 d4 i.d7! makes it difficult for White to get play for his pawn) 8 ... ttJf6 9 ttJdS O-O looks fine for Black.

As described elsewhere in this book, the for- mation c4/d3/e4 in conjunction with lbge2, g3 and .Bg2 is called the 'Botvinnik System', and it appears throughout the English Opening. We find it in the 3 g3 -Bb4 system of Chapter 4, for example, and on both sides of the Pure Sym- metrical variations in Chapter 7. Let's take a quick overview of the ideas. At first it may seem bizarre for White to close off
THREE KNIGHTS AND CLOSED ENGLISH 165
the long diagonal for his favourite piece in the English Opening, the bishop on g2. After all, that's the piece that works in conjunction with b4-b5 to put pressure on Black's queenside, and it is often the best replacement for a knight which is exchanged on d5. To add insult to in- jury, White creates a hole on d4, in fact, a won- derful outpost for his opponent's knight, which is already poised to occupy it! Black also has an easy time developing and castling, and can con- sider preparing the pawn-breaks ... b5 and .. .f5. Finally, it doesn't appear that White will achieve d4, his traditional central advance, for some time. As you might suspect, White has an answer to these objections. On the most basic but im- portant level, he stops Black's main freeing idea ... d5; White has five pieces controlling that square already! Then, when you examine the pawn-structure, you'll see that White has sev- eral attacking methods. He can use the pawn- lever f4, putting pressure on e5 and often threat- ening to play f5 followed by the traditional pawn-storm with g4-g5. Alternatively, White has available straightforward expansion on the queenside with moves such as b4-b5, c5 and a4-a5. Furthermore, Black's most natural at- tacking method involves .. .f5, but if in that case White can play exf5, his bishop on g2 comes to life again! In fact, the set-up with a pawn on e4 and bishop on g2 can be considered a prophy- lactic measure against Black's move .. .f5. The same situation arises with a pawn on e5 and bishop on g7 in the King's Indian Defence. As for that weakness on d4, I have men- tioned elsewhere a recurring theme in chess openings (particularly in modem ones) that giving the opponent outright control of a single central square early in the game is acceptable, provided that there are countervailing advan- tages. There are far too many examples to list, but you might think about, for example: a) the numerous variations in the Sicilian Defence in which Black surrenders the d5- square facing White's pieces on an open file; b) variations of the French Defence in which Black grants White an outpost on e5, also along an open file; c) variations of the Ruy Lopez in which Black plays ... c5 and gives up d5; d) variations of the King's Indian Defence in which White gives Black an outpost on d4; e) isolated queen' s pawn positions from any number of openings, with the outpost in front of the isolated pawn. One mitigating factor in the Botvinnik Sys- tem of the Closed English is that Black's out- post is not on an open file. So it's unlikely that we shall see rooks, for example, occupying d4; moreover, the bishop on g7 has a rather remote chance of getting there soon (although to be fair, White's break with f4 might be answered with ... exf4, changing that equation by freeing Black's g7-bishop). Just as importantly, the d4 outpost isn't as secure as it may look, and in- deed, White's third method of making progress is the advance d4 itself. That's because the move d4 is naturally assisted by the queen on dl, knight on e2, and potentially, a bishop on e3. This results in Black having to keep an eye on his d4 asset. Of course, there are other more concrete considerations, such as the nature of the struc- tural change that takes place when Black puts a piece on d4 and White exchanges it. Issues like these will hopefully be clarified in the exam- ples. P. Taylor - Gallagher British League (4NCL) 200213

These are typical developing moves for both sides. Now White is ready to advance on the queenside by b4-b5, perhaps in conjunction with llac1 and c5. The question is, what is Black to do? If he plays ... lbd4, White has the dual option of lbxd4 followed by .tg5, or .txd4 and placing a knight on f4; one of these two captures will generally yield an advantage. But a retreat by the c6-knight will encourage White to make the thematic break d4. So Black begins by picking the more aggressive course of dou- bling rooks. 11 •.• 1:[f7 12 f3 This modest nudge of the f-pawn is position- ally ideal, because it frustrates Black's main plans for counterplay. Another logical move is 12 .:tac1, to make c5 a possibility, perhaps af- ter b4-b5. The famous game Benko-Botvinnik, Monte Carlo 1968 illustrates play for both sides that radically differs from our main game: 12 ... l:taf8 13 f4!? (13 b4 f4!? 14 gxf4 .th3 gives Black some interesting counterplay) 13 ... fxe4 14 dxe4 lbc8! (D) (Dvoretsky proposes that 14 ... exf4 15 gxf4 .th3 is also satisfactory, be- cause 16 .txh3 'iVxh3 17 lbxc7lbe5! leads to eventual equality). We've seen this idea before: Black prevents White from simplifying by ttJxe7+, and he has in mind ... lbd8 and ... c6. He is also ready to play ... .th3, because c7 is now defended by the rook on f7. The game continued 15 c5 .th3 16 b4 .txg2 17 ~xg2 exf4 18 gxf4 .l:te8 19 lbg3 (Botvinnik gives 19lbec3) 19 ... h5!? (with the disappearance of the bishop on g2, White's e4- pawn is just enough of a sore spot that Black can scare up play to counter White's space advan- tage) 20 b5, and now Botvinnik suggests that 20 ... ttJd8 was a safe choice, whereas 20 ... h4!? 21 bxc6 bxc6 22lbc3 hxg3 23 hxg3 .txc3 24 'iVxc3 "V/iHe6 would have been about equal. Thus White's set-up with f3 tends to be more popular than the one with f4. 12• • .l:tafS 13 .l:tael An instructive game Csom-Gulko, Biel Inter- zonal 1976 is very similar to the text: 13 .l:tac1 ~h8?!

White has a near-winning advantage: space, open lines, and play against Black's weakened kingside. Black never had a chance to play ... f4; compare the game. 13 ••. 'Iti>h814 b3 tbg8 (D) It's hard to find a positive plan; Black may now be intending .. .fxe4 and ... ~h3, to probe the light squares. Again, the retreat 14 ... tbc8, intending perhaps ... tbd8 and ... c6, was better. w 15 exfS! This exchange has become more attractive You can see that White has hindered the mobility of Black's pawns. The move ... e4 will lose a pawn, of course, and ... exf4 is position- ally disastrous, bringing a knight to a wonder- ful outpost in front of an isolated pawn on an open file. But the real key to the position is Black's bishop on e6. Since there is no pros- pect of his f-pawn advancing, it remains cut off from White's kingside; yet that is where it belongs if Black is to have positive play in the position. The upshot is that White has a free hand to build up on the queenside and in the centre while Black lacks a useful strategy. Blocking moves by bishop's pawns often serve the function of limiting the effectiveness of op- posing bishops. For example, the move ... c5 in many variations of the Nimzo-Indian Defence helps to keep White's light-squared bishop in check. Similarly, in a main-line Griinfeld varia- tion with White's centre pawns on d4, e4 and f4, ... f5 limits the range of White's queen's bishop. 16•.• tbd4 (D) now that 15 ... tbxf5 is not a possible reply. W IS. .. gxfS?! For reasons we'll see shortly, a better recap- ture was 15 ... ~xf5. Nevertheless, White gains a central advantage by 16 d4; for example, 16 ... .Bh3 17 dxe5 tbxe5 18 f4! ~xg2 19 'lti>xg2, Peyrat-Le Quang, Bagneux 2000. After both 19 ... tbg4 20 ~d4 and 19 ... tbc6 20 tbec3 (or even 20 .Bd4! tbxd4 21 tbxd4), White has more space and he can go to work down the e-file.

17 fxeS!? Not a bad move at all, but 17 tbxd4! exd4 18 B ~f2 (D) is the normal transformation of this structure, clearly favouring White, who still limits the bishop on e6. Then the pawn on d4 will have to be de- fended, and White can attack on the queenside and along the e-file; for example, 18 ... c5 (19 tbxc7! was threatened, and White is doing su- perbly after 18 ... c6 19 .:te2! or here 19 tbc7 ~xc7 20 l:he6) 19 .:te2 ne8 20 l:!.fel tbf621 tbxf6 ~xf6, with either 22 ~xb7 or 22 g4!. 17 ..• tbxe2+ 18l::txe2 dxeS 19 d4

In fact, if Black gets ... g5 in, White is no longer able to alter the pawn-structure in a productive manner. There's an old saying about countering flank attacks with central action, but in this case 10 d4? actually weakens White's dark squares and burns up a tempo; then Black has a pleasant choice between 1O ... liJh5, 1O ... f3 11 iNxf3 iNxh3 and 1O .. .fxg3 11 fxg3 exd4 12 liJxd4 liJxd4 13 ~xd4 iNe6!, with pressure and the e5 outpost.

d6 6 d3 (D) It can be argued that White's move is less ac- curate than 6 ttJge2 because of the line Black chooses in the game. Both moves have their positive and negative points, however, and of- ten the move d3 will already have been played before this point - on move S, for example. 6 ..• hS!? Black employs a dynamic move that will ap- peal to those who really want to unbalance the play and avoid slow positions. Attacking by means of ... hS has been a favourite at high lev- els of play, and runs counter to the notion that Black is stuck with purely technical approaches in these Closed English variations. Black's first idea is obvious: to play ... h4 and attack the kingside. Perhaps ... hxg3 or ... h3 might follow, but in any case White is discour- aged from castling and needs to think about the disposition of his kingside. One of the less ob- vious points about 6 ... hS can be seen by com- paring the following game: 6 ... ttJd4!? 7 ttJge2 .i.g4 8 h3! (this move isn't at White's disposal in our main game) 8 ... .i.f3! (not 8 ... ttJf3+?? 9 Wfl; and 8 ... .i.xe2 9 ttJxe2 ttJxe2 10 'iVxe2 gives up the bishop-pair in a position where pawn-breaks like f4 and b4/cS are likely to hap- pen; even the abject iO ... cS won't exempt Black from lengthy defence) 9 .i.xf3 ttJxf3+ 10 ~fl (White's king will be safe on g2, and Black's knight will get chased back) iO ... ttJe7 11 ~g2 ttJd4 12 ttJxd4 exd4 13 ttJdS (D). This is Kasparov-E.Plihtz, Munich (blitz) 2002; White has a modest advantage. When Black has this 'dead point' on d4, his bishop on g7 has few prospects, and White can usually get good play by working around the pawn by playing f4 and/or b4.

7 Pure Symmetrical Variation
lc4c5(D) w The move 1...c5 introduces the Symmetrical English, which some think is Black's safest way to counter 1 c4. Positions within the pur- view of Symmetrical Variation theory can arise by a whole array of move-orders extending out to seven or more moves. That is, ... c5 (or even c4) may not arise until after various other moves have been played, but the resulting posi- tion will be one or another variation of the Sym- metrical. Apart from the English Opening proper with 1 c4, it's important to realize that there are a number of ways to get to a Symmetrical Eng- lish via the move 1 tbf3. In that case, both sides jockey to get their preferred variation. For ex- ample, the following lines and sub-lines may arise: a) 1 tbf3 c5 (note that this move-order al- lows White to playa Sicilian Defence by 2 e4)
2 g3 (or, of course, 2 c4) 2 ... tbc6 (2 ... b6 3 .Jig2

In practice, symmetry in the opening can de- velop into almost any kind of situation, but on a fundamental level we shall want to know if the game will become simplified, perhaps even sterile, or whether breaking symmetry will pro- duce rich and complex positions. In the English Opening, this issue arises most often after the introductory moves to this chapter: 2 tbc3 tbc6 3 g3 g6 4 .Jig2 .Jig7 (D) w For better or worse, I long ago dubbed this position the 'Pure Symmetrical Variation', to distinguish it from lines in which White or Black breaks the symmetry within the first few moves. Before entering into games, ideas and analysis, let me make a few general remarks. As much or more so than in any other varia- tion in the English Opening, this one runs the risk of 'excessive' simplification, mainly from White's point of view, since he has to figure out what to do about copycat moves, whereas Black can almost always find a reasonable way to un- balance the position. For example, play will sometimes peter out in the line 5 e3 e6 6 tbge2 tbge7 7 O-O O-O, when a number of grandmaster draws have resulted from 8 d4 cxd4 9 tbxd4 tbxd4 10 exd4 d5 11 cxd5 tbxd5 12 tbxd5 exd5.

continues 5 ... a6 6 .l:tb 1 nb8 7 b4 cxb4 8 axb4 b5 9 cxb5 axb5, and while it is certainly still possi- ble to create an imbalance, quite a few top play- ers will stop the clocks at this point (or shortly thereafter). That may be a matter of prior inten- tion, however, and some grandmasters believe that if White enforces a well-timed break in symmetry, he can still get a promising game. At any rate, you will find that the databases are crammed full of games with 5 e3 and 5 a3. And of course Black needn't go along with any of this; in fact, he can break symmetry after any of White's 5th moves. Some simple examples out of many are 5 e3 e5, 5 e3 ttJf6, 5 a3 e6 and 5 a3 ttJf6 (see below). Nevertheless, this perceived difficulty has contributed to the popularity of 5 ttJf3, which, as we shall see, can't be effectively imitated in the main lines without penalty. On the other hand, 5 ttJf3 offers Black a range of dynamic possibilities based upon the fact that, as in some variations with 1 c4 e5, developing his knight to e7 keeps his bishop trained on d4, and can give him opportunities which White lacks; for ex- ample, the move .. .f5. Having said all that, let's move on to some actual variations and examples. Romanishin - Beliavsky USSR Ch, Leningrad 1974

b3!? This move is slow, and not especially dan- gerous, but it can lead into instructive posi- tions in which typical themes are thrown into relief. White has the simple idea of i.b2 and later moving his knight from c3 to exchange the important g7-bishop; then he may be able to exploit Black's resulting dark-square vul- nerabilities on the kingside. Often the move f4 will be used to reinforce pressure along the al-h8 diagonal. Naturally, it's not so easy, and Black has a number of common-sense rejoin- ders. Another modest move is 5 d3. White is waiting to see what Black plays, and will usu- ally respond by transposing into another sys- tem via e3, e4 or ttJf3. A unique plan is 5 ... e6 6 i.xc6!? (D), as in Larsen-Markeluk, Buenos Aires 1991.
B
Regardless of Black's recapture, the point is to immobilize Black's centre pawns (thus keep- ing the bishop on c8 inactive) and then exploit Black's dark-square weaknesses to prove that the knight-pair is superior to Black's bishops. Thus the battle revolves about a successful ... e5: a) Black can capture towards the centre with 6 ... bxc6, when 7 ttJf3 e5! is the structure that Black is after. Notice that in that case, White doesn't even get the d5-square for a knight, as he often does versus a ... c5/ ... d6/ ... e5 formation. So White has reason to play 7 f4!?, restraining Black's centre and targeting dark squares; for example, 7 ... ttJe7 8 ttJf3 O-O 9 O-O d6, when White's most ambitious plan begins with 10 e4, trying for a timely e5, or even d4. b) The game continued 6 ... dxc6 7 f4! (again, 7 ttJf3 e5! lets Black's bishop escape) 7 ... ttJe7 8 ttJf3 ttJf5 9 e4!? ttJd4 10 e5 O-O 11 ttJe4 f6 12 exf6 ttJxf3+ 13'ilVxf3 i.xf6 14 ttJxf6+ 'ilVxf6 15 'iVe2 (White tries to prevent ... e5, but it's not so easy) 15 .. Jld8 16 i.e3 b6 17 O-O-O (it might seem as though 17 i.f2 followed by 18 O-O-O was better, with an apparent bind on e5; how- ever, 17 ... e5! 18 fxe5 'ilVg5 keeps affairs bal- anced) 17 ... e5!. This frees Black's bishop and equalizes. Both sides have weaknesses, and in spite of the opposite-coloured bishops, neither player has the firepower to conduct a winning attack against proper defence. We now return to 5 b3 (D): 5 •.• ttJf6 The moves 5 ... d6 and 5 ... e5 are fully play- able, and even 5 ... i.xc3!? 6 dxc3 d6 has been played, for which you might compare Larsen- Markeluk from the last note; then White does well to continue by e4 and ttJge2.

interesting alternative is S ... e6, when White's strategy is illustrated by 6 iLb2 0,ge7 7 Wic1!? (7 h4 h6 8 ~1!? d6 9 0,e4 eS 10 'iWd3!?) 7 ... d6 8 0,dS !?, but Black can simply play 8 ... eS! 9 d3 O-O with no real problems. 6 iLb2 O-O 7 0,h3!? White would like to play 0,f4 and control the crucial dS-square, clamping down on dS. By contrast, 7 0,f3 dS! equalizes; for example, af- ter 8 0,xdS 0,xdS 9 iLxg7 ~xg7 10 cxdS ~xdS, Black has more space and prevents d4. This standard sequence arises on both sides of the board in an array of variations. 7 .•• e5 Black in tum prevents 0,f4. Actually, 7 ... dS! (D) can be played to good effect because it takes advantage of the knight's position on h3. This is a common theme in the Symmetrical English (and in the Reversed Sicilian, for that matter; see the 1 c4 eS 2 0,c3 d6 3 d4lines). w There can follow 8 0,xdS (8 cxdS 0,xdS 9 O-O iLg4) 8 ... 0,xdS 9 iLxg7 r:j;xg7 10 cxdS iLxh3! 11 iLxh3 'iixdS 120-0 %:.ad8 13 d3 b6 with a nice space advantage and central pres- sure to counter White's bishop-versus-knight edge.

White tries to open the f-file while putting pressure on eS; nevertheless, this is fairly loos- ening. 9 ...iLd7 10 e3 iLxh3!?

This was originally the most popular version of the Pure Symmetrical variation. White's im- mediate intentions seem obvious: he wants to play d4, usually in conjunction with lL'lge2, es- tablishing control over more territory. The strat- egy of a3 and b4 arises from time to time, but less often than in other Symmetrical English lines because of White's emphasis on the d4 break. Sometimes, S e3 is used as an introduc- tion to systems with d3/e3, particularly if Black plays an early ... eS. Black can pursue differing strategies, so I'll try to describe his plans in the games and notes. Overall, even though S e3 can yield an unbal- anced game, it tends to be dryer than other vari- ations of the English Opening. The temptation for an author is to skip over such lines and con- centrate upon more exciting material, of which indeed there is plenty in this book. However, you should get an understanding of the Sym- metrical variations that develop more slowly, in order to decide whether this method of play ap- peals to you with either colour. 5 ••. e6 (D) w Benko - Geller Wijk aan Zee 1969 This symmetrical move limits Black's op- portunities to cause trouble for his opponent, but in turn offers less leeway for White to pull off surprises. In fact, S ... e6 is one of the main reasons that White hesitates to play S e3, espe- cially against a lower-rated player, because he feels that it runs the danger of wasting a game in which he has the advantage of the white pieces. But this fear is overrated, and White can still pose his opponent numerous difficulties. In addition, Black can break symmetry when he finds it attractive to do so. This variation is helpful to examine because it gives insight into the technical play that the English Opening can

Nothing much seems to be going on here, but in fact, White is trying to unbalance the posi- tion in a way that causes Black some problems, potentially even tactical ones. Obviously, White wants to capture on dS, and he has cleared dl for his rook. On the downside, his own d-pawn hangs after an exchange on that square. 11 .•• tLIxd4 After 1l....Bxd4!? 12 exd4 tLIxd4, 13 'it'dl recovers the pawn and gains the bishop-pair.

He is taking over the dark squares and has a slight lead in development that creates tactical threats. 15 ... i.h3 This is a good idea in principle, to get rid of the monster bishop on g2.

18 .•• l:tfc8 After 18 ... l:tfe8?! 19 lbf6+ i.xf6 20 i.xf6, White's bishop is a huge piece, and will easily outweigh the knight, both at the moment and in any minor-piece ending with pawns on both sides of the board. 19lbf6+ Rh8 20 l:td7 b6 (D) The remarkable thing is how, throughout this whole game, Black is never able to work his way out of these seemingly inconsequential difficulties.

9 .tb2l:tb810 d3 a611 'ifd2 bS (D) Quite a few games have arrived at this posi- tion. White's intentions are to develop and then play a combination of liJdS, followed by d4 and/or f4 as the opportunity presents itself.

This examination of S e3 should give you an insight into how apparently harmless moves can lead to mixed outcomes in the Symmetrical English Opening. Sometimes the play peters out to a dull equality; that won't happen, how- ever, unless both sides cooperate. In this last game with S. .. eS (and in the notes), you find the lack of direct engagement between opposing forces in the early part of the game; this ex- presses itself in the Pure Symmetrical English more so than in any other variation. Again, that doesn't preclude an imbalanced struggle if the players are so inclined. Flank Attack with 5 a3

Oddly enough, the little nudge is actually one of the most popular and effective continua- tions in the position. That may seem absurd, but
PURE SYMMETRICAL VARIATION 185
when you consider that White's strategy in the Pure Symmetrical lines almost always involves b4, it makes sense to playa move that you're going to include in your plans anyway. On top of that, there are several 'accidental' benefits to 5 a3. For instance, both 5 ... e5 and 5 ... e6, two mainstay defences versus almost any other of White's 5th moves, offer White the immediate chance to enter into surprisingly active gambit lines which are much more lively than, say, 5 e3 e6 or 5 e3 e5. Speaking more generally, we can say that any of White's other 5th moves such as 5 e3, 5liJf3 and 5 e4 tip his hand, so that Black can react accordingly. The move 5 a3 tries to reverse the situation: now it's Black who must respond. If you examine modem chess openings, you will find many cases where these 'little waiting moves' (especially a3 and ... a6) have become increasingly popular. How this works out can only be shown by examples: Kasparov - Karpov World Ch match (game 8), Seville 1987

e5 In fact, this game featured a completely dif- ferent move-order (1 c4 e5 2 liJc3 d6 3 g3 c5 4 ~g2 liJc6 5 a3 g6 6 b4 ~g7), but it soon merged with the standard one that I've pre- sented here. I can't cover all the details behind 5 a3, but we'll address 5 ... e6 in the next game, along with a brief look at 5 ... a6. Here are a few lines whose ideas cross over into other variations: a) 5 ... a5 stops b4, but grants White's knight access to b5. This is an important distinction. Then 6 liJf3 is an improved version of 5 liJf3 below. You should compare the lines directly, but a few ideas are that after 6 ... e6, the pawn sacrifice 7 d4! is stronger than after 5 liJf3 e6, and that 6 ... liJf6 7 d4 cxd4 8liJxd4 is much im- proved for White over the main line below with 5 liJf3 liJf6 because he has access to b5 and Black lacks his usual counterplay via ... a6. b) 5 ... d6 is a perfectly good move that opens up a large number of transpositional possibili- ties; for example, 6 .l:tbl a5 7 liJf3 e5 8 O-O liJge7 will enter into 5 liJf3 e5 territory, and an early e4 will be related to 5 e4 below. An independent line is 6 e3!?, and if 6 ... e5, then 7 b4, which is arguably more fun than 5 e3 e5. Apart from other 6th moves, Black could answer 6 e3 with 6 ... ~xc3!?, for which com- pare 5 d3 e6 6 ~xc6!? at the beginning ofthis chapter. Having the move a3 in does not signifi- cantly benefit White, if it does so at all (perhaps there are a couple of lines in which bringing a rook via l:ta2 to d2 or e2 or f2 might help, but that's reaching). In most lines, Black should play ... f5 in order to discourage e4. c) A difficulty with the move ... liJh6 in many English positions is that White's h-pawn ad- vance can't be blocked, and that applies here: 5 ... liJh6 6 M! liJf5 (the usual ... h5 or ... h6 isn't at Black's disposal) 7 h5 b6 8 d3 ~b7 9 h6! (D). Out of a calm beginning we are about to get a torrent of activity. Hodgson-Arkell, Isle of Man 1996 continued 9 ... ~f8 (Hodgson analyses 9 ... ~e5 10 g4! liJfd4 11 f4 ~c7 12 e3liJe6 13 liJd5 to a large advantage; still more convincing here is 13 g5) 10 b4!? (or 10 ~f4) 1O .. :~c8 11 liJe4!? cxM 12 axb4 liJxM 13 ~b2 f6?! (the best defence was 13 ... l:tg8! 14 'iNd2!? a5 with the idea 15 g4 d5!) 14 g4! liJxh615 g5 (White just keeps pounding away!) 15 ... liJg8 (15 ... liJg4 16 l:th4!), and here White should plunge into the line 16 'iVd2! a5 17liJf3! ~xe4 18 dxe4, offer- ing yet another pawn: 18 .. :~xc4 19 l:!.cl 'iff7 20 e5!, when the attack is crashing through. d) 5 ... b6 furnishes a good answer to 5 a3, because it goes about the business of challeng- ing White's bishop on g2 while shoring up c5.

This sacrifice characterizes many lines of the Symmetrical English. The idea is to break down Black's grip on the centre by inducing ... cxb4. Failing that, White gains space and retains the options of bxc5 and b5 for a while. 6 ••. d6 Black really shouldn't accept the pawn: 6 ... cxb47 axb4 4:Jxb4? 8 i.a3 i.f8 (8 ... 4:Jc6 9 4:Jb5 i.f8 10 i.d6! i.xd6 11 4:Jxd6+ 'it>f8 12 i.d5 4:Jh6 13 c5 with a huge bind) 9 ~a4. Then Black has dark-square weaknesses and no de- velopment to speak of: 9 ... a5 (9 ... 4:Jc6 10 4:Jb5 i.xa3 11 ~xa3) 10 4:Jf3 f6 11 0-04:Jh6 12 d4! and Black's position is collapsing. With the text-move, we have now transposed into the actual course of the Kasparov-Karpov game.
7.l:tbl
7 bxc5 dxc5 8 i.xc6+!? bxc6 9 l::tbl has ideas of d3, 4:Jf3 and i.e3, etc., attacking the weak c-pawns.

(intending ... e4) 12 i.g5 i.h3 13 4:Je4 .:tab8! with a complex, challenging game ahead. 7 ... 4:Jge7 It's simplistic to say that ... 4:Jf6 never goes with a ... c5/. .. d6/. .. e5 pawn-structure, but in this case 7 ... 4:Jf6?! allows White to exchange his queen's bishop for a knight after 8 d3 O-O 9 i.g5! (D).
B
To appreciate this, you should compare the main lines, which we shall see in a later section under 5 4:Jf3 e5. There Black has a knight on e7 and can answer i.g5 with .. .f6, to avoid an ex- change on e7.

Black's bad bishop is no match for a knight here. This is a particularly instructive example. 8e3!? Alternatively, White can work with the for- mation 8 d3 O-O 9 4:Jf3 (9 e3 would transpose to our main game).
8. .. 0-09 d3
We've arrived at a scene from the 5 e3 line, except that there Black prevented b4 by playing ... a5.

'iWd8100ks best, with some advantage to White because of the out-of-play knight on a5, rather than 16 ... b6?! 17 i.xa5! bxa5 18 4:Jc3, when the knight is clearly better

than Black's bishop, which is stuck behind its own pawns.
13 O-O tLlb7
Now Black is ready for ... dS. Rather than place his knight on dS, White decides to make the pawn-structure symmetrical and count upon his space. This is hardly inspiring, yet forces Black to find a few good ideas. 14 e4!? 'iii>h8 14 ... h6! was suggested, feinting on the king- side and preventing White's i.gS. Alternatively, 14 .. :~'d7 would prepare to bring the b7-knight back into the game via d8. 15 "i!kc1 f5!? Perhaps a slight misjudgement by Black.

It's strange that Black doesn't want to recen- tralize and perhaps exchange this piece. Thus 20 ... tLld8! 21 a4 tLlf7 22 as i.h6 was suggested, with the idea of ... tLlgS, hitting the light squares. Here 21...tLle6 is also acceptable. 21 tLlec3 l:tbe8 22 tLle4 White has developed an advantage, and even- tually broke through on the kingside. M. Domingo - Alekseev Berlin 2006

e6 This simple move is probably the most im- portant response to S a3. Black prepares ... tLlge7 and ... dS. I'm not going to go too deeply into S ... a6, which has loads of theory behind it, except to point to what I think are the main lines: 6 ~b1 .l:!.b8 7 b4 (7 ~a4 was long ago solved by 7 ... tLld4! with the idea ... bS, and the gambit 7 ... d6!? gives fair compensation) 7 ... cxb4 8 axb4 bS 9 cxbS (9 cS?! as is already awkward for White) 9 ... axbS 10 tLlf3 (D) (l0"tLlh3 eS! cuts off the knight from f4).

Sadly, a lot of the play after S. .. a6 6 l':.bl 1:.b8 depends much more upon specifics than understanding. We now return to S. .. e6 (D): w 6 b4!? This rich and dynamic pawn sacrifice is the most popular move, in part because S a3 doesn't have enough effect on the game otherwise. This is not to say that White can't arrive at a normal game by 6 l'!bI, when after 6 ... aS, 7 e4 is a Botvinnik System, while he can also choose 7 tiJh3 or 7 h4!? 6 ... tiJge7!? can also be tried, when 7 b4 cxb4 8 axb4 dS looks logical. Black counters a flank attack with a central attack, al- though that's not always a trustworthy rule. There might follow 9 bS tiJaS 10 cxdS exdS 11 i.a3, which is unbalanced in an interesting way; for example, ll...d4 12 tiJe4 O-O 13 "iVa4. 6 ••• tiJxb4!? This pseudo-sacrifice actually ends up win- ning material. If Black grabs the b-pawn di- rectly, we see a type of position that applies to numerous lines of the Symmetrical English: 6 ... cxb4 7 axb4 tiJxb4 8 i.a3 (D). Now what? a) If Black simply retreats by 8. .. tiJc6?, White goes all-out on the dark squares by 9 tiJbS!, threatening 10 tiJd6+ followed by 11 tiJxb7+ (winning the queen), or 10 i.d6. Black has to play 9 ... i.f8, when White's simplest course is to gain a very large lead in active development by 10 tiJf3 i.xa3 11 .l:.xa3, perhaps piling up on the dark squares next by means of~al and cS; even h4-hS is an idea. This sort of thing tends to be disastrous for Black. b) 8 ... i.f8 saves the pawn, although any number of moves by White are good enough to compensate for it and then some; for example, 9 tiJf3 tiJf6 10 "iYb3 as 110-0 i.e7 12 e40-0 13 eS tiJhS 14 d4. 7 axb4 cxb4 8 d4! bxc3 9 e3 (D)

It's worth talking about some general fea- tures here. Black is two pawns ahead, soon to be one if the c3-pawn falls. His development matches White's and his weaknesses are fairly well covered. What is White's compensation? First, he will have a powerful bishop along the a3-f8 diago- nal, which either prevents or discourages cas- tling, and he possesses two open queenside files. The configuration of open a- and b-files versus the opponent's a- and b-pawns (with Black's c-pawn gone) is a common one in a breadth of openings. Such a configuration, as- suming that White can place rooks on the files,
PURE SYMMETRICAL VARIATION 189
generally favours him, even when both the a- and b-pawns are passed. A signal case would be the main-line ~bl Exchange Grtinfeld, in which pawns have been exchanged on d4 and Black has grabbed White's a-pawn by .. :~aS+ and .. :~xa2 (see Volume 2). In the position before us, Black's a- and b- pawns are flanked by White's c-pawn, making them difficult to advance. Another problem faces Black: his c8-bishop and a8-rook can be hard to activate. A similar situation arises, for example, in a typical Benko Gambit (disregard- ing move-order issues): 1 d4 ttJf6 2 c4 cS 3 dS bS 4 cxbS a6 S bxa6 g6 6 ttJc3 ~xa6 7 ttJf3 ~g7
8 g3 d6 9 ~g2 ttJbd7 10 O-O O-O 11 ~c2 ~aS 12
llbl .l:!.fb8 (D). w Ignoring concrete variations, Black's piece set-up is designed to prevent White's a- and b- pawns from advancing without creating weak- nesses, and to tie White's pieces to the defence of the pawns. The strategy is time-tested, so much so that in the Benko Gambit, Black often has compensation for a whole pawn. The same type of gambit structure arises in several varia- tions of the King's Indian Defence and the Eng- lish Opening, among others. But our English Opening position in the main game, in which Black has no pawn on d4 (as White does in the Benko Gambit, for example), is not as compel- ling as the gambiteer might like it to be. For ex- ample, the same 'c-pawn versus a- and b-pawn' structure arises in the French Wing Gambit via
1 e4 e6 2 ttJf3 dS 3 eS cS 4 b4 cxb4 S a3 bxa3 6
~xa3 and in the Sicilian Wing Gambit via 1 e4 cS 2 b4 cxb4 3 a3 bxa3 4 ~xa3. Neither of these variations is terribly impressive on a theoretical level. Fortunately for White, the position in our game (after 9 e3, pictured in the diagram) also contains positive features related to White's mobile centre. Perhaps it all adds up to dynamic equality. 9 ••• ttJe7 9 ... ttJf6 10 ttJe2 O-O gets the king to safety, but reveals Black's difficulties on the dark squares; for example, 11 ~a3 d6 12 ttJxc3 a6 (versus ttJbS) 13 ~b3 l::tb8 14 O-O .l:te8 IS l::tfbl and White's bishops are impressively supported by his other pieces. 10 ttJe2 (D)

10 ... d5 Or 10 ...

Now: al) Black can play the typical and ambitious 14 ... aS, to make space for his pieces and get his pawns moving. Then IS ~xdS?! has tactical problems after IS ... a4 followed by 16 ... 11aS with tempo, and then 17 ... ~e6!' A better move is IS 'iVxdS, when White's extra centre pawns are stronger in principle than Black's passed ones. Finally, White can leave things be and de- velop by IS O-O!, when Black is slightly at a loss for good moves. a2) Ptacnikova-S.Kasparov, Olomouc 2003 continued 14 ... ~e6 IS 'iVxb7 as 16 O-O ~e8 17 ~a3 .:!.b8 18 'ilia711a8 19 'ilib7 .:!.b8 20 'iVa6 with the idea of retreating to e2.

(D)
White chooses the Botvinnik System, popu- lar among experienced players. The ideas are very similar to those in the Botvinnik System of the Closed English, which we saw in Chapter 6 (1 c4 eS 2 0,c3 0,c6 3 g3 g6 4 .tg2 .tg7 S e4). White cedes an outpost on d4 in order to pre- vent ... dS and 'work around' his own weakness by playing f4 or b4, in some cases preparing d4 by d3, 0,ge2 and .te3. For all his nefarious intentions, White's set- up is usually considered less dangerous versus the Symmetrical English than the Closed Eng- lish, and still less so than against certain varia- tions of the King's Indian (see Chapter 12). Primarily (although not entirely), that's because the idea off4-fS isn't very scary for Black when his pawn is on e7 and not eS. In the latter case, Black's position is vulnerable to the idea f4-fS followed by g4-gS and f6. 5 ••• 0,f6 I'll concentrate upon this reply for its the- matic value and because of its relevance to S 0,f3 eS. But Black has numerous options: a) S. .. e6 isn't really that different from the lines already covered with colours reversed via S e3 eS; Black sets up with ... 0,ge7, ... O-O, ... d6 and possibly ... b6, achieving equality. b) Alternatively, Black can play for an early ... bS by some combination of ... a6, ... lIb8 and, if needed, ... 0,d4. Even the immediate S. .. a6 6 0,ge2 bS!? is played; 6 a4 is a simple way to prevent this, but it's unclear which move, ... a6 or a4, is the more important concession! c) A particularly irritating line that Black can use is S ... eS (or S ... d6 6 0,ge2 eS), when White has to try to exploit his extra tempo to en- gineer a properly-timed f4 or b4. That's not so

easy, but fortunately for both sides, not many players of Black will want to limit their pros- pects in this way. d) Finally, direct expansion on the kingside by S. .. d6 6liJge2 hS has little theory behind it, and yet a few master games have seen 7 h3 (7 h4) 7 ... eS !?

Black's most famous strategy involves the expedition ... liJe8-c7-e6, which we shall discuss in the next game. There are two other worthwhile tries: a) An oddly neglected move is 8 ... i.g4. Black emulates White's strategy in the position stemming from S liJf3 eS. If 9 h3, 9 ... i.xe2 looks good. In the reversed variation, when White plays i.gS, Black avoids the exchange by ... f6, which in this case would translate into 9 f3, when Black can reply 9 ... i.d7, or the more interesting 9 ... i.e6!?

White is already threatening b4, which will open the b-file to his considerable advantage. In fact, this standard plan has also succeeded for Black in the reversed position (as we shall see in the section on S lLlf3 eS). It turns out that White's extra tempo accentuates his queenside advantage. ...lLlc7 13 b4lLlce6 14 bxcSlLlxe2+ 14 ... dxcS secures d4 more tightly. Then White can either play ISlLldSlLlxe2+ 16 'iWxe2 (for example, 16 ... lLld4 17 'iVa2! e6 IS i.f4! eS 19 i.e3), or IS f4 lLlxe2+ (1S ... fS 16 eS) 16 lLlxe2 'iNaS 17 eS!, when the combination of more active bishops and space grants him the superior game.

lLlf6 6 lLlge2 O-O The slight change of move-order with 6 ... d6 makes a difference if White plays 7 O-O. In fact, castling might even be considered an in- accuracy! It gives Black an attractive resource, which if nothing else deserves attention be- cause we shall see White play the same idea in the reverse position via SlLlf3 eS. Specifically, Black can embark upon the line 7 ... lLld7!? S d3 lLlfS! (D). w The knight gets to its desired spot just in time after 9 i.e3 lLle6, controlling the d4-square and having in mind its occupation. In the main game, Black plays ... lLlf6-eS-c7-e6, and here ... lLlf6-d7-fS-e6. Where did he get the extra tempo? Simply by not castling. So it would seem that, instead of 7 O-O, White should simply play 7 d3 (or S d3lLlf6 6 e4), pre- cisely to avoid the ... lLld7-fS-e6 manoeuvre. In that case 7 ... lLld7?! S i.e3 lLlfS 9 d4 is another matter, because White takes charge of the centre. But 7 d3 has its own drawbacks, for one thing because it forfeits the chance to play d4 in one step and also opens up possibilities such as 7 ... i.d7 S O-O!? hS! with a flank attack. For ex- ample, play might continue 9 h4 :LbS 10 f3 (ver- sus ... lLlg4) 10 ... O-O 11 i.e3 a6 12 d4?! (12 a4 ~a5 is unclear) 12 ... cxd4 13lLlxd4lLleS! 14 b3

7 .•• ttJeS In the previous game, we saw Black play a combination of ... d6, ... a6 and ... .i.d7. Here he intends ... ttJc7-e6, to head off White's d4 push and perhaps occupy the d4-square himself.

Then ll...ttJe6 can be met by 12 ttJde2! (D).
B
With this knight retreat, we've arrived at a position that has arisen scores of times and crops up in various forms in related variations such as 5 ttJf3 e5 below. White has a definite advantage, because Black has lost his grip on the centre and will find it very difficult to shake White's bind. Sd3 White could try to stop ... ttJc7-e6 by playing
8 f4 d6 (8 ... ttJc7 9 f5) 9 d3 ttJc7 10 f5. But this
gives up the e5-square, and 10 ... nb8 with the idea ... a6 and ... b5, and/or ... ttJe5 and ... .i.d7, should maintain the balance. S. .. ttJc7 9 .i.e3 ttJe6 10 f4 Since White can't play d4, he expands on the kingside.

B
Many of the leading players have always played the tLlf3 lines of the Pure Symmetrical Variation. I phrase it that way because this in- cludes not only those who arrive at the posi- tion by means of 1 c4 c5 2 tLlc3 tLlc6 3 g3 g6 4 i.g2 i.g7 5 tLlf3, but also the sizeable number who come to it by other means. The possible move-orders are too numerous to list, since both players can make the basic moves in al- most any sequence; but you can work out how easy it is for the relevant positions to arise from 1 ttJf3, 1 c4 c5 2 tLlf3 (or here 1...tLlf6 or
1...g6), 1 c4 c5 2 tLlc3 tLlc6 3 tLlf3, or any sys-
tem in which the moves g3 and i.g2 are played at an early stage. The benefit of playing tLlf3 before or by move 5 is that White can castle quickly and prepare to play d4. Black has to address that possibility so as not to lose ground in the centre. Let's first see what happens if he tries to maintain symmetry. Traditional Main Line with S. .. ltJfS
1 c4 c5 2 tLlc3 tLlc6 3 g3 g6 4 i.g2 i.g7 5 tLlf3
tLlf6 6 O-O Already we have an important juncture. As- suming that you're playing White and heading for the main lines with d4, I'd recommend 6 d4(!)(D).
B
This can, and usually does, enter the main line when Black plays 6 ... cxd4 7 tLlxd4 O-O 8 O-O (which is equivalent to 6 O-O O-O 7 d4 cxd4 8 tLlxd4). But this move-order is important, in my opinion, because it circumvents 6 O-O d5, a respectable equalizing variation which we shall see in the next note. Looking at the alternatives, we see that White benefits from 6 d4 in some other respects, whereas Black can exercise some new options: a) 6 ... d6 is shaky. By committing to ... d6 be- fore castling, Black gives White a chance to play 7 dxc5 (7 d5 tLla5 8 tLld2 transposes to a King's Indian Defence; see below; furthermore, 70-0 can return to our main line after 7 ... cxd4 8 tLlxd4 tLlxd4 9 ~xd4 O-O; if Black passes on 8 ... tLlxd4 and plays 8 ... i.d7 a good response is 9 tLlc2!, avoiding exchanges; then a number of games over the years have been played with 9 ... O-O 10 b3 ~a5 11 i.b2, when White gener- ally gets some advantage) 7 ... dxc5 8 Wixd8+
(D).
By exchanging queens at this point, White gets a superior version of the variation 6 O-O O-O
7 d4 d6 8 dxc5 dxc5. He seems to stand better;
for example, 8 ... tLlxd8 (8 ... <.t>xd8 9 i.f4 and 10 O-O-O+ wins too much time) 9 i.e3 tLle6 10 tLlg5 1? tLlxg5 (1O ... tLld4 110-O-O tLlg4 12 tLld5) 11 i.xg5 and Black has some troubles in the face of i.e3 followed by tLld5. b) Another way for Black to deviate (after 6 d4) is by 6 ... cxd4 7 tLlxd4 d5!? (7 ... O-O 8 O-O is the main line), but 8 O-O O-O 9 cxd5 tLlxd5 10 tLlxd5 tLlxd4 11 i.g5! is very uncomfortable for

him because of the threat 12 tDxe7+. The best response is 11...tDc6, when 12 'ilVa4!, intending .l:.fdl, gives White a strong initiative. c) Finally, 6 ... 'ilVaS!? (D) has some intrigu- ing nuances. w A surprisingly respectable line is 7 dS tDe4!? 8 dxc6 tDxc3 9 'ilVd2 'ilVb4! 10 O-O tDe4 11 'ilVd3 tDd6 12 .i.f4 dxc6 13 .i.xd6 exd6 14 ~xd6 'ilVxb2! IS l':!.adl 'iVf6 16 'ilVxcs 'ilVe7 17 :d6!, Akopian-Shulman, European Ch, Ohrid 200l. White manages to equalize just in time because of 17 ... O-O 181hc6!. White may do best to gambit a pawn by 7 O-O cxd4 8 tDxd4, allowing 8 ... 'ilVcS. This is Black's point: he forces White's knight to commit and simultaneously pesters the c4-pawn. On the other hand, he fails to develop. In the game Boger-Kumar/Samraoui, correspondence game 2002, White plunged ahead by 9 tDdbS! O-O (D) (9 ... 'it>d8 10 .i.f4!). Now he should have continued 10 tDc7! l:i.b8 11 tD7dS 'ilVxc4 (ll...tDxdS 12 cxdS tDd4 13 w .Be3) 12 .i.f4 l:.a8 (a nice trick is 12 ... eS? 13 .i.xeS! tDxeS 14 tDxf6+ .i.xf6 IS 'iV d6 !, forking rook and bishop) 13 b3 'iVcs 14 M! ~c4 IS bS!, and in most lines tDxe7+ will badly damage Black's pawn-structure.
6 ... O-O
Taking the initiative in the centre makes sense, before White does. Therefore Black should strongly consider 6 ... dS 7 cxdS (7 ~a4!? is an idea that might be worth a look) 7 ... tDxdS
(D).
This is an important position, both in this move-order and in other lines which may trans- pose (say, 1 c4 tDf6 2 tDc3 g6 3 tDf3 dS 4 cxdS tDxdS S g3 .i.g7 with ... cS soon to follow). I'm not going to cover this line in detail, but it's thought to be equal based upon long expe- rience. Black's light squares are a little weak on the hl-a8 diagonal, but White can only achieve so much by trying to exploit them. The best-known line goes 8 tDxdS (8 d3!? hopes to get more than enough compensation following

This line provides White an incentive to play
6 d4 rather than 6 O-O. Not surprisingly, there
are multiple options for both sides at every juncture from moves 10 to IS, so you may want to do your own investigation. 7 d4cxd4 Two points here: a) Trying to maintain symmetry with 7 ... dS (almost never played) leads to the better game for White after 8 dxcS (or 8 cxdS cxd4!? 9 ltJxd4ltJxdS 10 ltJxdSltJxd4 11 .ligS!) 8 ... dxc4 9 'iYa4. b) Since the main line with 7 ... cxd4 isn't easy for Black to play, he may want to look into 7 ... d6 (D), which is a Fianchetto Variation of the King's Indian Defence. w White can play ambitiously by entering the fascinating main line 8 dS ltJaS 9 ltJd2 (which requires study for both sides) or simplify by 8 dxcS dxcS and then 9 .lie3 or 9 .lif4. The 8 dxcS line has generally been considered satisfactory for Black, although his winning chances are se- riously reduced in some variations. White may also be discontent, because his abstract advan- tage will often dissipate within a few moves. You'll have to refer to King's Indian theory to sort this out. SltJxd4 (D)

We've reached what used to be considered the main line of the entire Symmetrical Eng- lish. Because White seems to retain a nagging
198 MASTERING THE CHESS OPENINGS
edge with best play, it no longer has that ele- vated a status. Still, new ideas appear on a regu- lar basis, and grandmasters haven't abandoned the variation as Black. I'll discuss the basic ideas in the following games. Metal - Hogye Correspondence game 1994

liJf3liJf6 6 O-O O-O 7 d4 cxd4 8 liJxd4liJg4!? Black has various minor alternatives to 8 ... liJxd4 (see the next game) and 8 ... liJg4, but none are held to equalize; for example, 8 ... a6?! allows White to play 9 c5!, attacking b6 and discouraging ... d6. Quite a few contests have featured the gam- bit 8 ... d6 9 liJxc6 bxc6 10 Ji.xc6, but Black probably lacks enough compensation: 1O ... l::i.b8 (White stands better after 1O ... Ji.h3 11 Ji.xa8 "iVxa8 12 f3 Ji.xfl 13 'it>xfl 1:tc8 14 ~d3) 11 Ji.g2 "iVa5 12 ~c2. Skipping over most of the theory, one example is Lukov-Y.lvanov, Varna 1995: 12 ... Ji.f5 (12 ... Ji.e6?! 13 Ji.d2 with the idea 13 ... Ji.xc4 14liJd5) 13 e4 Ji.e6 14 b3! (or

(Cummings suggests 16 ... Ji.f6 17 liJxf6+ exf6

pair, a pawn, and an attack for the exchange af- ter 19 't!Vc3!) 17 Ji.e3! ~e5 18 f4 't!Vb2 19 't!Vbl!, winning a piece. So we now return to 8 ... liJg4!? (D): w This popular non-developing move is an at- tempt to transform the pawn-structure, which currently favours White due to his greater con- trol of the centre. Black attacks d4, forcing White to make a decision. But why put the knight on this odd square? First and non-trivi- ally, it discourages White from the useful move
9 Ji.e3. In addition, since it turns out that 9 e3 is
White's best move (refusing to lose time by re- treating), Black aims for a specific idea: he in- tends to play a combination of ... liJxd4 and ... liJh6-f5, working on White's dark squares, in particular attacking the pawn on d4. Of course, 8 ... liJg4 doesn't do anything for Black's queen- side development and completely cedes control of e4 and d5 to the white knight. Therefore White has some time to reorganize, as best ex- plained by example.

The critical move. White supports his centre, attacks the knight on g4, and prepares for slow expansion after developing by b3 and Ji.b2. In addition, the move liJd5 can be useful.

strategy will be to break down White's grip on the centre, which means directly attacking the c4-pawn and/or chipping away at it with the move ... b5. 10 "iWd3 The queen retreats from any potential at- tacks along the al-h8 diagonal, but stays in touch with the centre and keeps the c-pawn de- fended.

After the text-move, 10 'iVd3 (D), we see that White has more space and greater control of the central squares.
B
Notice that with this structure, Black has a more active king's bishop than he does in the Hedgehog Variation (see Chapter 10), where he has the structure ... d6/ ... e6 and the bishop is on e7. But the cost is a dear one: Black's other bishop on c8 has trouble developing and no ideal square to go to. In the meantime, the de- sirable central move ... e6, preventing a knight from coming to d5, would seriously weaken Black's d-pawn. Black's counterplay will cus- tomarily involve ... a6 and ... b5 (usually sup- ported by ... :b8 and sometimes by ... 'ii'a5). Or he can directly attack White's c-pawn by moves such as ... .Be6 and ... ttJd7-e5; if needed, the move ... b5 might come later, with additional force. Because of the influence of the g2-bishop, Black will sometimes try to compel White to adopt a Maroczy Bind structure (e4/c4) by playing ... .Bf5 and provoking e4 in return. This happens in the next note, although probably prematurely. In terms of specifics, White may not always object to ... b5 because it can loosen Black's queenside and give White play down the c-file with his rooks; the worth of ... b5 has to be as- sessed by both parties on a case-by-case basis. In many positions, White will play ttJd5, chang- ing the pawn-structure in his favour if Black has to capture. He also has the simple development l:ldl (as above) which might prepare pawn- breaks with c5 or e5; the move .Be3 can have a similar function. 10 ... a6 For many years, this flexible pawn advance has been the main line. Black reasons that he will probably play ... a6 anyway, and he wants to prepare for an eventual ... b5 advance without committing his other pieces and pawns. The most interesting alternative is probably 1O ... .Bf5 (D), which tempts White to play e4 and close off the diagonal of his g2-bishop. w But it costs a tempo, and Black got in trouble quickly in the nice example Smyslov-Timman, Moscow 1981: 11 e4.Be6 12 b3 (12 .Bd2 can

11 Ji.d2!?
There are several other possibilities here, in- cluding the old main line with 11 Ji.e3 ttJg4 12 .Bd4 ttJe5 13 ~d1. I think a particularly promising continuation is 11 lIdl, directly exploiting the d-file. White's immediate idea is 12 c5. This is not so easy to meet; for example: a) 11...Ji.f5?! 12 'it'f3! (threatening both 'iWxb7 and c5). Now in Gay-Campbell, corre- spondence game 1985, Black played the clever 12 .. .'tlfc7 13 ~xb7 lIa7! 14 ~xc7 lIxc7 15 e4 Ji.e6, and it looks as though the c-pawn is about to fall; nevertheless, 16 e5! dxe5 17 b3 leaves White with two active bishops and a passed c- pawn. After the more natural 12 .. J:tb8, White plays 13 c5! and gains the upper hand, because the black d-pawn is about to become fatally weak.

e5 (D) The Botvinnik structure again, but this time Black is employing it. This defence is very im- portant, not only because those who play slZ'lf3 will often have to play against it, but because it can arise by many different move-orders that involve an early ... cS and ... eS. A common one, for example, is 1 c4 cS 2 lZ'lf3 lZ'lc6 3 lZ'lc3 eS 4 g3 g6 S j.g2 j.g7, and anyone playing 1 c4 cS 2 lZ'lc3 g6 3 lZ'lf3 j.g7 who doesn't want to ven- ture into 4 d4 cxd4 S lZ'lxd4 lZ'lc6 will probably accede to 4 g3 eS. You should definitely compare S e4 lZ'lf6 in the 'Symmetrical Botvinnik: S e4' section to see an explanation of the themes and ideas that follow. Here I'll try to expand upon those con- cepts on a case-to-case basis. 60-0 Unfortunately, it's not feasible to cover the multitude of possible move-orders. Here's a couple of deviations that might be enlightening: a) A fascinating sideline goes 6 d3 lZ'lge7 7 lZ'ld2!? (D) with the idea lZ'lfl-e3. As explained in the reversed position (after the moves S e4 lZ'lf6 6 lZ'lge2 d6 7 O-O lZ'ld7! ?), White is planning three knight moves to get to e3 (lZ'ld2-fl-e3), just as the knight moves three times following O-O and then lZ'le1-c2-e3. The difference is that he has saved the move 6 O-O, and is thus able to stop Black from playing ... dS in the critical line 7 ... d6 8 lZ'lfl j.e6 (8 ... lZ'lfS 9 lZ'le3 lZ'lxe3 10 j.xe3 j.e6 appears slightly better for White; 8 ... a6 with the idea ... bS is another op- tion) 9lZ'le3 iVd7 10 lZ'ledS. White has gained his dS outpost without suffering any punishment. Compare the next game, where he doesn't do so well. After 10 lZ'ledS, a plausible continuation is 10 ... O-O (after 1O ..

Over the years this has been Black's most popular defence to 5 ttJf3. With 5 ... e6, he endeavours to create an immediate imbalance by placing his king's knight on e7, in contrast to White's on f3. Furthermore, he will usually play ... d5, strongly influencing the centre, whereas White will apparently have to be content with the less formidable d3. Why would White agree to this? First, be- cause 5 ... e6 creates a few sore points on Black's dark squares d6 and f6; perhaps he can exploit those with the right strategy. In addition, White is able to bring his pieces out just a tad more quickly than Black; not dramatically so, but just enough to prepare expansion on the queenside via b4 before his opponent is fully ready to meet it.
208 MASTERING THE CHESS OPENINGS
In objective terms, Black should be able to gain approximate equality. However, he must be ready to handle both tactical and positional strategies from his opponent, who controls the fundamental direction of play. 60-0 If White wants to employ a set-up with d3, he probably does best to play it now, because 6 d3 0,ge7 allows for a quick and useful 7 .tg5!; we shall see why that is so in the next game. Here are two among several alternatives: a) You should note the fact that 6 e3 nor- mally transposes to the 5 e3 lines, because 6 ... 0,ge77 d4 cxd4 8 0,xd4 follows - see 5 e3 e6 above. b) 6 h4!? (D) is a thought-provoking move.
B
White hopes that after 6 ... h5, Black's weak- nesses may count for something. Then the reader might want to analyse 7 d4!? and com- pare it to 5 0,f3 e6 6 d4 below; it doesn't hurt that White can play 0,g5 without getting chased away by ... h6. Apart from 6 ... h5, Black some- times permits White to advance the h-pawn; for example, 6 ... 0,ge7 7 h5 or 6 ... d5 7 h5, both of which are double-edged. Finally, the most com- mon move, 6 ... h6, might be compared with 6 d3 0,ge7 7 .tg5 h6 8 .td2 of our next game; here, too, White will try to gain a tempo by 'fIVc 1 at the right moment. c) 6 a3 is fairly popular due to 6 ... 0,ge7 7 b4!? (D). But this has several reasonable replies: c1) 7 .. .lDxb4!? 8 axb4 cxb4 90,b5 (9 0,e4 .txal 10 d4 .tc3+ 11 <t>f1 O-O 12 .tg5 is a fan- tastically complex line) 9 ... iLxal 10 'fIVa4 .tf6 11 'i¥xb4. This position has been said to provide
B
White with enough compensation, but that as- sessment may be optimistic. c2) 7 ... cxb4 8 axb4 0,xb4 9 .ta3 offers White some compensation for a pawn, although 9 ... 0,ec6! with the idea 10 ~a4 a5 11 Itbl O-O! should be fine for Black; instead, 100-00-0 11 d4 could be tried. c3) The safe 7 ... b6 8 Itbl 0-090-0 has been played a few times, although then 9 ... d5?! may not be best, because 10 bxc5 bxc5 11 0,a4 gives White some pull. Another issue about this move-order with 6 a3 concerns 6 ... d5 (instead of 6 ... 0,ge7). Then
7 O-O 0,ge7 (7 ... dxc4 8 'iVa4) 8 d3 resembles
our main line. You could argue that the move a3 has been played rather early, although I see no obvious way for Black to exploit that. 6 ... 0,ge7 7 d3 O-O 8 .td2 The sort of position that Black would like to head for is illustrated by 8 a3 d5 9 cxd5!?

This is Csom-Smejkal, Kiel1978. White has adequate play, but his position is difficult to handle. The d4-pawn is a troublesome intruder, whereas White's cxd5 has freed Black's queen's bishop. In fact, Black's bishop tends to stand better when nicely centralized on e6 than on b7. For the next few moves, the same consider- ations apply to the option of playing cxd5. 8 ••• dS 9 a3 b6 10 1:[bl i.b7 11 b4 This game has influenced how White's set- up is viewed, in part because Fischer called Petrosian's move 11 b4 a mistake; and others append '?!' to it and speak of Petrosian's bad judgement. In fact, other moves are passive, and White has his share of the play. 11 ... cxb4 12 axb4 dxc4 13 dxc4 (D)
B
A fundamental imbalance has arisen that we see in some of the most important variations of 5liJf3 e6 (and 5 e3liJf6). White has a structure with hanging pawns, in which the one on c4 can be a target on the open c-file. However, he has the idea of creating a passed pawn by c5, which can highlight Black's weakness on d6 and work in conjunction with a rook on dl.

The immediate 1l...d4 12liJa4 allows White to play b4 after which, because of the knight's attack on cS, Black is forced to exchange his pawn there; once freed, White's queenside pawns can cause all sorts of mischief. For ex- ample, look at a position such as that after 12 ... J.d7 13 b4 (D). White's simple idea is that Black will have to B kick the bishop out at some point by ... h6, which will lead to a small weakness. More sig- nificantly, the already desirable move ~c1 will come with a gain of tempo in the most impor- tant variations. 7 .•. h6 Black can wait, for example by 7 ... O-O 8 O-O dS, but then 9 .l:!.bl will probably transpose any- way after a likely ... h6, and he also has to con- sider 9 ~cl, stopping ... h6, or 9 ~a4.1t doesn't seem worth it for Black to allow White extra possibilities. S J.d2 (D) S. .. dS This aggressive central advance has been al- most automatic with most masters who use S ... e6. Instead, Black can legitimately play more slowly, combining ... d6 with ... b6 and ... J.b7, or even try for ... a6 and ... bS. Of course, you can argue that he might then have been just as well off to play S ... d6 rather than S ... e6. It's also not clear whether 8 ... O-O makes any difference. 9 'iVc1 !? is a possible reply, and the White has achieved the b4 advance more rapidly than he might have, but the point is a general one. You should compare this type of position with a typical one from the Panno Vari- ation of the King's Indian Defence (see dia- gram on following page). Here White has defended c4 by liJf3-d2. In our English Opening position, Black's knight on e7 is three moves away from a square from which it could defend cS. That fact provides some of the motivation for b4 (and ... bS) in the Symmetrical English: once the move is achieved,

there is a good chance that it will compel the breakdown of the central support on cS (or c4). Finally, White will make the b4 pawn-break even if Black plays ... as; this results in pressure on Black's weak b6-pawn. 12 ~c1! A major point of 7 .i.gS!. Black's king will gain nothing by being on h7 rather than g8, so White has gained a full tempo over the previous game, which he uses to clear the d-file and sup- port his queenside advance. Instead, the ex- change 12 cxdS exdS 13 b4 cxb4 14 axb4 is (once again!) harmless due to 14 ... d4 IS lba4 lbdS. 12 ... ~h713 b4 Now the capture bxcS will fix a weakness on cS (assuming recapture with a pawn), so Black exchanges. 13 ... cxb414 axb4 (D)

14 ... dxc4 14 ... ~d7 allows White to achieve his desired advance by IS cS!, after which he threatens bS, and also controls d6.

(lS ... lbd4 is better) 16 cS! bxcS 17lba4 with a clear supe- riority, since the dark squares are collapsing: 17 ... c4 18 dxc4 dxc4 19 lbcs ~c7 20 ~xc4 .i.dS 21 ~4l:.c8?

An interesting position, very much like Fischer-Petrosian above, and also like those lines that we saw above stemming from S e3 lbf6 6lbge2 d6, etc., with colours reversed. But in this case White has gained the extra move ~c1, which not only gives him time to create a passed pawn on the queenside by cS, having in mind lbbS-d6 or lbe4-d6, but clears the way for .l:tdl. Black is already hard-pressed for a solu- tion to this strategy. IS. • :ili'c8!? This has been the normal move, as in the re- versed position. Black's situation is more criti- cal than it may seem at first: a) The thematic and innocent-looking move IS ... .l':tc8?

For many years this radical pawn offer was not taken seriously, partly because the expendi- ture of two tempi to place a bishop on g2 would not generally fit into a sacrificial scheme. So, what is going on? Above all, White is trying to exploit the weak dark squares created by the move 5 ... e6, in particular d6 and f6. In what fol- lows he will play either tDb5 or tDe4, attacking d6. In addition, 6 d4 frees his dark-squared bishop to rush into play by .Bf4 or i.g5, hitting
PURE SYMMETRICAL VARIATION 213
one of those weaknesses. Since Black's c-pawn will end up on d4 (or gone), the potential ma- noeuvre b3 and i.a3 will strike at the d6-square and sometimes prevent castling (even i.b2 at- tacks down the long diagonal), and the advance cS might add to White's grip on d6. Finally, the move e3 can be relevant, adding to the attack on d4 and potentially opening White's f-file (if ... dxe3 is answered by fxe3). So we can see the contours of what White is aiming for. That's all well and fine, but Black has his own set of advantages, not least of which is that he will win a pawn; in many cases, the time that White has to expend recov- ering it will give Black the chance to develop rapidly. Furthermore, he gains a central major- ity, which enables him to play either an ag- gressive ... dS, breaking up White's centre, or ... eS, securing the d4 point. The centre pawns are by themselves a barrier against White's plans to infiltrate into the dark squares. Further- more, although White is about to make a very useful move with his knight, it is his second move with the same piece, and a third will usu- ally come shortly. 6 ••• tLJxd4 In the next game I address the alternative 6 ... cxd4. 7 tLJxd4 cxd4 (D) w 8 tLJe4 White sets up for cS, i.gS and/or tLJd6+.

The position of White's bishop on c4 varies from that of its English Opening counterpart on g2, but the goal of exploiting weaknesses on the dark squares d6 and f6 is the same. Instead of 6 ... cxd4, 6 ... ttJxd4 7 ttJxd4 cxd4 (7 ... i.xd4? 8 ttJbS i.eS 9 f4) 8 ttJbS is also similar our Eng- lish Opening line. In that case, White antici- pates 8 ...

In order to achieve the most complications with winning chances for both sides, play should continue with 1O .. :i¥xc6, to which I'll return in a minute. But Black can cut into White's winning chances (and proba- bly his own) by opting for the developing move 1O ... lbe7. This leads to a balanced but much duller position; for example, 11 lbxd4 'iWb6 12 lbb3 (12 cxb7 .Bxb7 13 .Bxb7 'ii'xb7 14 lbf3 O-O IS O-O .l:tfd8 is awkward for White in spite of his extra pawn, O.Foisor-Ungureanu, Roma- nian Ch, Tusnad 1997; if White tries to avoid the retreat by playing 12 e3, 12 ... eS! takes the initiative) 12 ... lbxc6 13 0-00-0, with equality. Here is a sample line: 141:!.dl!? .l:td8! IS 'i!Vel lhdl 16 ~xdl eS 17 .Be3 lbd4, and after the most interesting and arguably best move 18 f4, the action peters out following 18 ... .Be6 (even 18 ... .Bg4 19 fxe5 lbxe2+ 20 Rf2 ~e6 21 .Bf3 .Bxf3 22 'iitxf3 'ii'xe5 23 'ii'xe2 ~S+ will end in perpetual check) 19 fxeS .ixeS 20 .Bxd4 .Bxb3 21 .Bxb6 .ixdl 22 .Bc7! .Bxc7 23 .l:!.xdl l:td8!, and the opposite-coloured bishops draw. Given that 1O ... lbe7 is so hard to crack, let me give a mere skeleton of 1O .. :iVxc6, even though the theory on it could fill a small mono- graph: 11 O-O 'ii'b6 12 b3 lbe7 13 .Ba3 lbdS (13 ... lbc6 14 tlac1 eS IS e3! breaks up the cen- tre to get at the king) 14 .l:!.ac 1 lbc3 IS e3!?

In any case, playing 12 cxb7 first prevents this if White so desires. 15 i.xb7 nbS (D) w 16b3 What is happening in this position? White has regained his pawn, and can boast of the bishop-pair and queenside majority, whereas Black has a lead in development, two mobile centre pawns and b-file pressure. As we'll see, everything comes down to specifics. Before going on with the game, I'll address a neglected issue that has some practical im- pact. After IS ... .l:tb8, White is supposed to be able to force a draw with 16 .l:f.c1 'iVa2 17 l:!.a1 ~xb2 18l:!.b1, etc. But there's much more to it. First, Black is able to keep things alive with 18 ... 'it'xb7!? 19 ':xb7 ::'xb7. This seems ac- ceptable as a winning try, since Black needn't trade either of his rooks after 20 O-O O-O 21 'i¥c2 :tfb8. Going back to the position after 16l:!.c1 'it'a2, then, White can bypass the above ifhe in- terposes 17 i.a6, having in mind 18 i.bS+. Following 17 ... O-O 18 b4, White threatens 19 i.c4, trapping the queen. Then Black can still secure a likely draw by playing 18 ... 'it'a3 (threat- ening 19 ... lDdS to his apparent advantage), af- ter which 19 i.c4 allows Black to sacrifice the exchange productively by 19 ... .l:txb4! 20 i.xb4 'iVxb4+, so White presumably repeats by 19 l:!.a1'iVb2 20 l:tbl, etc. In this line, Black's only try for a win would be 18 ... 'it'dS!? 190-0 'iVd6, but if nothing else, White can play it safe with 20 i.c41DdS 21 i.xdS'it'xdS 22 .l:tc7 followed by 'it'c2 and .l:tfc 1. Finally, after 17 i.a6, Black can try to sacri- fice the exchange for two pawns by 17 ... 'it'xb2?! 18 i.bS+ .l:txbS 19 axbS 'it'xbS. In Stryjecki- Kokarev, World Under-18 Ch, Oropesa del Mar 1999, only White seemed to have winning chances: 20 l:tb1 ~c6 21 0-00-022 i.b4 .l:te8 23 i.xe7 .l:txe7 24 .l:tb8+ l:te8 2S'it'c1!? (or 2S ~b3) 2S ... 1i'd7 26 .l:txe8+ 'it'xe8 27'it'c7. Having covered all that, let's return to White's best winning try, 16 b3 (D):

8 Main Lines with 2 tt:Jf3 and d4
Introduction to 2 ttJf3
1 c4 c5 2lZ'lf3 (D)
B
The move 2lZ'lf3 with the idea of an early d4 appeals to players who want to stake out space in classical fashion. It is particularly important because so many English Opening adherents prefer to start with the move 1 lZ'lf3 (preventing ... eS) and then 2 c4. Thousands of games have seen 1 lZ'lf3 cS 2 c4 and 1 lZ'lf3 lZ'lf6 2 c4 cS. In fact, many more top-level games are played in the lZ'lf3 lines than in the Pure Symmetrical variations of Chapter 7. I shall therefore be giv- ing a more detailed and theoretical look at the material in this chapter than in most others. The main lines are replete with examples of funda- mental themes, especially those relating to space and centre. 2 lZ'lf3 gives the game a fundamentally dif- ferent character than 2 lZ'lc3. White's knight covers the central dark squares, for the moment preventing ... eS. He prepares to play d4 on one of the next two or three moves, an advance that rarely happens so early in the lines stemming from 2lZ'lc3. As a consequence, White will rule over more territory, and his queen and queen's bishop will usually have open lines and influ- ence in the initial stages of the game. Again, with a few exceptions, we didn't see this in the Pure Symmetrical variations of Chapter 7. Of course, every move gives up something, and the most obvious consideration when look- ing at 2lZ'lf3 is that White won't be able to place a knight on e2 in conjunction with e3 or e4, as in the previous chapter. Also, in lines in which White plays d4 and Black replies ... cxd4, White's pieces are more exposed to attack than in variations with g3 and .i.g2. Finally, because White's set-ups are relatively limited, Black has more leeway than his opponent in choosing a pawn-structure and piece formation. You can view this as being advantageous, in that Black has the flexibility to react to circumstances; on the other hand, you might argue that White's control of space reduces Black to a defensive posture, regardless of what he does. Right away, the material divides into two main paths. Variations with 2 ... ttJc6
1 c4 c5 2lZ'lf3lZ'lc6 (D)
Black's main reply to 2lZ'lf3 has traditionally been 2 ... lZ'lf6. More and more often, however, leading players have turned to 2 ... lZ'lc6 in an MAIN LINES WITH 2 ttJj3 AND d4 219 attempt to guide the game into channels of their choosing. Black's general wish is to bypass certain cramped positions that he suffers in the main lines stemming from 2 l2Jf3 l2Jf6. One of the important thoughts behind 2 ... l2Jc6 is to play 3 ... e5, usually followed by ... g6 and ... i.g7, establishing the Botvinnik formation that we are familiar with from Chapters 6 and 7. If White plays 3 d4 to prevent that, Black can transpose to main lines after 3 ... cxd4 4 l2Jxd4 by 4 ... l2Jf6 or 4 ... e6, but he can also play inde- pendently with moves such as 4 ... ~b6. Alter- natively, White can commit to 3 g3 or shift the decision back to Black by 3 l2Jc3. Naturally, there are trade-offs in each situation, and both sides can play independently if they want to. With that in mind, let's tum to games and see if we can understand the subtleties from exam- ples and analysis. Because of the diversity of move-orders and independent strategies stem- ming from 2 ... l2Jc6, the notes will require some patience to sort out. Kramnik - Navara Wijk aan Zee 2007
1 c4 c5 2 l2Jf3 l2Jc6
I'm not going to focus heavily on the conse- quences of irregular second moves, because they are of such diffuse character at this point. Nevertheless, to get you started, here are some bare comments: a) 2 ... g6 is an elastic move that can go sev- eral directions including, crucially, 3 d4. Then upon the normal 3 ... cxd4 4 l2Jxd4, Black has difficulty preventing the move e4; for exam- ple, 4 ... i.g7 5 e4l2Jc6 6 i.e3 (or 6l2Jc2), when we have a version of a Sicilian Defence, Mar- oczy Bind variation. Of course, 5 e4 isn't nec- essary, but the alternative 5 g3 l2Jc6 6 l2Jc2 agrees to 6 .. :iVa5+ 7 i.d2 'iVc5 or 7 .. :~'b6, both described under the move-order 2 l2Jf3 l2Jc6 3 g3 below. Returning to 2 ... g6 3 d4 cxd4 4 l2Jxd4, the only normal-looking, non-transpositional op- tion from Black's point of view is 4 ... l2Jf6 5 l2Jc3 d5?! (else 6 e4), when 6 i.g5 dxc4 7 e3 has a good reputation, but 6 i.f4! with the idea l2Jdb5 is even more awkward to counter. Finally, 2 ... g6 can be answered by 3 l2Jc3, when an independent line is 3 ... i.g7 4 e3. Then the conventional response is 4 ... l2Jf6 5 d4 cxd4 6 exd4 d5, which is actually a line of the Caro- Kann Defence, Panov Attack (1 e4 c6 2 d4 d5 3 exd5 cxd5 4 c4 l2Jf6 5 l2Jc3 g6 6 l2Jf3 i.g7). Black might also consider 4 ... i.xc3!?, with a philosophy similar to that in the 1 c4 e5 lines in- volving ... i.b4 and ... i.xc3. Remember that those positions are always easier to play if White has committed to the move e3, which ob- structs his bishop on c 1. b) With the other fianchetto, 2 ... b6, Black hopes to enter some sort of Hedgehog position following 3 g3 i.b7 4 i.g2. This is rather com- mittal, however, because White can play 3 l2Jc3 (or even 3 e3) 3 ... i.b7 (the similar 3 ... e6 4 e3! l2Jf6 5 d4 is examined via the sequence 2 l2Jf3 l2Jf6 3l2Jc3 b6 4 e3 in the next chapter; it has the same ideas) 4 e3! (D).
B
Now Black must give ground in order to prevent White's d4-d5 advance: 4 ... l2Jf6 5 d4 cxd4 6 exd4 dS? (6 ... e6 is better, though 7 i.d3 preserves a nice spatial plus) 7 cxdS l2JxdS 8 l2JeS! l2Jxc3 9 bxc3 a6 (versus 10 i.bS+), and a surprisingly powerful move is 10 .l:i.bl!, when it's hard to prevent 11 ~a4+; for example, 10 ... bS? l1.l:i.xbS!, or 1O ... e611 'iVa4+l2Jd712 ':xb6!. 3l2Jc3 I'll use this move to illustrate some unique lines that Black uses as alternatives to main-line Four Knights theory. We shall see 3 d4 in the next game. The alternative 3 g3 (D) is important and complex. It requires an understanding of move- orders and the resulting transpositions. Rather than memorize what follows, you can use it as a

reference while becoming comfortable with playing the 2 tLlf3 tLlc6 lines.
B
White's fianchetto can be answered with an assortment of moves, but it is played with par- ticular regard for Black's attempts to play an early ... tLlf6 and ... dS. There can follow: a) 3 ... eS 4 tLlc3 g6 (4 ... tLlf6 S i.g2 dS? falls for the familiar trick 6 cxdS tLlxdS 7 tLlxeS! tLlxc3 8 tLlxc6 tLlxd 1 9 tLlxd8 tLlxf2 10 tLlxf7 tLld3+ - the only chance - 11 exd3 r:J;;xf7 12 O-O+ 'lite8 13 b3!, and Black is thoroughly bound up) S i.g2 i.g7 and we have arrived at a reversed Botvinnik System of the Pure Sym- metrical Variation - see Chapter 7; whether someone wants to contest either side of this po- sition is a matter of taste. b) 3 ... g64 i.g2 i.g7 S O-O (or S tLlc3) will usually bring us back to a Pure Symmetrical Variation; for example, if Black plays S. .. eS, S. .. e6 or S. .. tLlf6, then 6 tLlc3 transposes to Chapter 7. Instead, 4 d4 cxd4 S tLlxd4 i.g7 (D) is one of the least inspiring times for White to play into a d4 system. For example, 6 tLlc2 (6 tLlxc6 dxc6!? 7 ~xd8+ 'it>xd8 already gives Black a favourable pawn-structure, since the c6-pawn limits the g2-bishop, while White's move c4 makes the bishop on g7 more effective - only because White is ahead on time can we evaluate this po- sition as level; furthermore, 6 tLlb3 as! with ... a4 to follow wins time for Black, because 7 a4?! would weaken b4 too seriously) 6 ... ~a5+!? (6 ... d6 is less dramatic, but certainly playable, with the idea 7 i.g2 i.e6) 7 i.d2!? (7 tLld2 dS! establishes Black in the centre) 7 ... ~b6 (after 7 .. :Wics, 8 tLlc3! tLlf6! 9 tLle3 is unclear, as is 8 w i.c3 tLlf6, which is safer than grabbing a pawn by 8 ... i.xc3+ 9 tLlxc3 'ilVxc4) 8 tLlc3 ~xb2!? 9 tLldS (9l:tbl?? 'ilVxc3) 9 ... 'litd8 10 i.g2 e6. Here Black seems to escape in reasonably good shape. In return for serious pressure from the white forces, Black is a pawn to the good, and his central majority helps greatly in the de- fence. Of course, his king will remain in the centre for a while and this may not appeal to ev- eryone. This whole line is unexplored and up in the air. c) 3 ... tLlf6 (D) is highly transpositional, but can also produce distinct lines: w c1) 4 i.g2 dS S cxdS tLlxdSleads to standard 'Asymmetrical' variations of Chapter 9 follow- ing 6 tLlc3 tLlc7 or here 6 ... e6. Instead of 6 tLlc3,
6 d4 isn't too dangerous if Black knows what
he's doing. Black has at least three reasonable moves. Play often goes 6 ... cxd4!? 7 tLlxd4 tLldM 8 tLlxc6 'iVxdl + 9 'it>xdl tLlxc6. While this should probably be equal, White can create an imbalance by 10 i.xc6+!? bxc6 11 i.e3,

when ROder-Gupta, Sort 2006 went 11...g6 12 lbd2 il.g7 13lbc4 0-014 ttc1 il.e6 and Black's bishops compensated for his weak c-pawn. This type of position is thought-provoking enough to reward some study and practice. White can also play simply 10 lbc3, when the best-known ex- ample is Kramnik-Kasparov, Frankfurt (rapid) 2000: 1O ... il.d7!? 11 il.e3 O-O-012 WeI eS 13 l:!.c 1 'iitb8 14 f4 with a little pull. Instead of all this, Black can get a perfectly good game by an- swering 6 d4 with either 6 ... il.fS!, intending 7 O-O lbdb4, or 6 ... lbb6 7 dxcS 'iVxdl + 8 'iitxdl lba4 9lbc3lbxc3+! 10 bxc3 il.fS 11 il.e3 il.e4, Andersson-Timman, Tilburg 1991. c2) After 4lbc3 dS, the ordinary-looking S cxdS lbxdS 6 il.g2 g6 7 O-O il.g7 is a Pure Sym- metrical Variation from Chapter 7. However, S d4 transposes directly to our main game Kram- nik-Navara (for which I've used the more com- mon move-order 2 ... lbc6 3 lbc3 lbf6 4 g3 dS S d4). This is one of the primary motivations for White to play 3 g3. c3) Finally, we might see 4 d4 cxd4 Slbxd4
(D).
B
Unless Black wants to go for a Pure Sym- metrical Variation by S. .. g6 6 il.g2 il.g7, etc., he will usually play S. .. e6. Then 6lbc3 is the main Four Knights line. However, the unique move 6 il.g2 opens the door to many deviations from the norm. Among these are 6 ... ~b6, 6 ... il.b4+ and 6 .. :iVaS+, the last often leading to 7 il.d2 'iVb6 8 lbb3, when 8 ... d6, 8 ... aS and even 8 ... hS!? are options! Lastly, Black can play 6 ... "iic7; for example, 7 O-O a6. Unfortu- nately, the English Opening has hundreds of these lesser-played alternatives throughout, so I'll opt out and leave it up to readers to investi- gate any in which they have an interest. After that lengthy digression about 3 g3, let's return to 3 lbc3 (D) and our main game Kramnik-Navara: 3 .•. lbf6 In the next game but one we'll see the impor- tant move 3 ... eS. a) Black also has the rather bizarre-looking 3 ... lbd4, a popular move which tries to prevent an effective d4 on White's part. Black justifies moving a knight twice by the threat of ... lbxf3+. I'll have to forego an analysis of the broader theory here, but will comment on two varia- tions: al) I like White better than most analysts seem to in the line 4 g3 lbxf3+ S exf3 lbf6 6 d4! cxd4 7 ~xd4 g6 8 il.g2 il.g7 9 O-O O-O 10 f4
(D).
B
White has two open central files and control of every central square other than d4. Of course,
222 MASTERING THE CHESS OPENINGS
the doubled f-pawns are immobile and Black's pieces have good scope. Vander Sterren-Tim- man, Rotterdam 1998 continued 1O ... d6 11 B ..td2!? a6!? 12 l:lac1 l:lb8, and Timman sug- gests that White only equalizes with 13 ~d3, but this may well favour White because of his extra space; for example, 13 ... ..tfS 14 ~e2 ..tg4 IS 'iWe3 ~d7 16 b3 bS?! 17 tZJdS!. a2) A more significant variation, and what is currently the main line, goes 4 e3 tZJxf3+ S 'iVxf3 g6 6 b3 ..tg7 7 ..tb2 d6 8 g4!? (D).
B
This is a fun move to play, and I think a good one. White grabs space, prepares ..tg2, and wants to cramp Black's game with gS and/or h4-hS. The most popular solution has been 8 ... l:lb8 (after 8 ... tZJf6, 9 gS!? tZJd7!? 10 h4 tZJeS 11 'iVg2 ..tg4 12 ..te2 ..txe2 13 ~xe2 with the idea hS and/or f4 was very comfortable for White in Van Wely-Akopian, Enghien-les- Bains 2001; 9 h3 is a solid alternative) 9..tg2 ..td7 (with the idea ... ..tc6) 10 'iWe2 a6 (after 1O ... tZJf6 11..tf3!? ..tc6, 120-O-O prepares d4- don't forget the centre! The logical alternative 1O ... 'iVc8 11 gS ..tc6 is proposed by Krasenkow, but similarly, 12 ..txc6+ 'ili'xc6 13 O-O-O with the idea 14 d4 gives White the advantage, as does 12 f4 h6 13 O-O-O!) 11 gS bS 12 d3 'ili'aS 13 l:lcl!? (D) (13 ~d2 is a good alternative). This fascinating position has been reached a few times. In A.Petrosian-Skripchenko, Dort- mund 2000, White stood better after 13 ... h6 14 h4 hxgS IS hxgS l:lxhl + 16 ..txhl eS 17 ~d2 tZJe7 18 tZJe4!? 'ili'b6 19 f4. Instead of this, Palliser approves of 13 .. .fS, as played in Pigu- sov-Alekseev, Russian Team Ch, Tomsk 2001. That game continued 14 ~fl?! ~f7 IS h4 hS! with equality. The king is oddly placed on fl, however; White should prefer 14 h4 hS IS O-O!, with what seems a traditional English Opening advantage. He has strong bishops, central pros- pects and the safer king. For example, IS ... ~f7 (IS ... e6? 16 tZJe4!; IS ... eS 16 tZJdS; IS ... b4? 16 tZJdS'iWxa2 17l:lc2) 16 d4!? (or 16 tZJdS!, with the point 16 ... ~xa2 17 l:lc2 ~xb3 18 ..txg7 ~xg7 19l:lb2 ~a4 20 l:lfbl! ~aS 21l:la2, etc.) 16 ... cxd4 17 exd4 bxc4 18 tZJdS! e6 19 tZJf4! with the idea 19 ... cxb3? 20 ..tc6! ..tc8 21 ..tdS! exdS 22 l:!.xc8, etc. That's only analysis, of course, but I think Black must seriously im- prove upon his basic set-up here. b) A fairly common alternative is 3 ... g6. It can lead to 4 g3 ..tg7, with a Pure Symmetrical variation, or to these: bI) 4 d4 cxd4 S tZJxd4 ..tg7 is generally re- garded as satisfactory for Black. One interest- ing variation is 6 tZJc2!? ..txc3+ 7 bxc3 ~aS. Oddly enough, this is a reversed position of the Rubinstein Variation of Chapter 9, but the tempi are the same! This comes from the fact that in the reversed position, White moves his queen twice to arrive at 1 c4 cS 2 tZJc3 lLlf6 3 g3 dS 4 cxdS lLlxdS S ..tg2 lLlc7 6 'iWb3!? lLlc6 7 ..txc6+ bxc6 8 'iVa4. See that chapter for de- tails. b2) 4 e3!? can be a little awkward for Black: 4 ... lLlf6 (4 ... ..tg7 S d4 has a poor reputation for Black; although S ... d6 is playable, with the idea of ... ..tg4 in some lines, he has to be willing to play against dS and e4 at some point; tradition- ally, White begins with 6 ..te2) S d4 cxd4 6 exd4 dS. Now we have a kind of reversed Tarrasch Queen's Gambit. White can develop normally by, for example, 7 ..te2 ..tg7 8 0-00-0 MAIN LINES WITH 2 tDf3 AND d4 223 9l:te 1 or try a unique line such as 7 .i.gS .i.e6!?

vinnik-Petrosian, World Ch match (game 8), Moscow 1963. Botvinnik played 12 .i.c1 .i.g7 13 .i.bS, but Tal later demonstrated 12 O-O! i.xa3 13 'iixa3 'iie7 14 ~c I! with a nice edge. b22) Black's other defence is 9 ... lLldS!? 10 .i.xdS e6 11 .i.xc6+ bxc6, when theory favours White's prospects, but the position isn't clear. If you're interested in lines that are slightly off the beaten track, these might be for you. 4g3 The actual move-order used in this game, by the way, was 1 lLlf3 lLlf6 2 c4 cS 3 g3 lLlc6 4 lLlc3. I have chosen to begin with 1 c4 in order to show other lines from the English Opening along the way. 4 ... d5 (D)

This position can also arise from 2 lLlf3 lLlf6 3 lLlc3 lLlc6 4 g3 dS. 5 d4!? A surprise. Black was probably aiming to get to a conventional variation stemming from S cxdS lLlxdS 6 .i.g2; for example, 6 ... eS (or 6 ... lLlc7) 7 O-O lLlc7, with a Rubinstein Varia- tion (see Chapter 9); or 6 ... g6 7 O-O .i.g7, which we've looked at via the Pure Symmetri- cal with S lLlf3 lLlf6 6 O-O dS 7 cxdS lLlxdS. 5 ... cxd4 The ubiquitous Tarrasch Queen's Gambit pops up again after S ... e6 6 cxdS exdS. Here 6 ... lLlxdS is the Keres-Parma Variation (Chap- ter 9), and should be considered for someone who wants a more active game than he gets here. The alternatives are quite complex: a) S ... .i.g4(D) .

This resembles White's play in the Griinfeld and might be profitably compared with it: al) 6 cxdS lLlxdS (6 ... .i.xf3?! 7 exf3 lLlxdS 8 ~b3 lLlxc3 9 bxc3 cxd4 10 .i.c4! e6 11 'iNxb7 with the idea 1l...'iic8? 12 .i.a6!) 7 .i.g2 cxd4!? 8 lLlxd4 lLldM! with approximate equality, in- tending 9 a3 eS!. This ... lLldM manoeuvre crops up repeatedly in the Symmetrical English. a2) 6 .i.g2 .i.xf3 7 .i.xf3 seems to offer White only a very small advantage, if that. Black probably won't equalize after 7 ... dxc4 8 dS! lLld4 9 .i.g2 lli'aS 10 .i.d2 O-O-O 11 e3 lLlfS 120-0 lli'a6 13 b3! with queenside attacking chances. However, Black has two better meth- ods. First, 7 ... lLlxd4 8 .i.g2! (8 .i.xdS lLlxdS 9 cxdS g6 10 O-O .i.g7 is fine for Black) 8 ... dxc4 9 .i.xb7 J:i.b8 10 .i.g2 lli'd7 11 O-O e6 confers only a modest edge on White. In addition, the modest 7 ... e6!? is surprisingly tough. White's bishops don't seem to mean a lot; for example, 8 cxdS lLlxd4 9 .i.g2 lLlxdS 10 lLlxdS exdS 11 O-O .i.e7 12 e3 lLlc6 13 .i.xdS O-O. This proba- bly favours White, but not by much, since Black's queenside majority (barring .i.xc6, which is fairly harmless) counts for as much as White's own majority in the centrelkingside, because White has difficulty mobilizing his pawns. b) After the natural S ... dxc4!?, White can reply with the equally obvious 6 dS!, although this entails a sacrifice. Then Black has two

White's beautifully centralized pieces combine with Black's weaknesses to grant White a comfort- able advantage. Finally we return to Kramnik-Navara: 6 tbxd4 dxc4 Since White now gets an edge in a dry posi- tion, I'll claim author's indulgence to specu- late that the more dynamic reversed Grtinfeld Defence position initiated by 6 ... eS 7 tbxc6 bxc6 (D) is playable, and close to equal for Black. w This is another one of those paradoxical po- sitions in which an extra white move, in this case tbc3, can be a liability as well as an asset, because it exposes White to a timely ... d4. Com- pare the Grtinfeld Proper main line with 1 d4 tbf6 2 c4 g6 3 tbc3 dS 4 cxdS tbxdS S e4 tbxc3 6 bxc3 i.g7 7 tbf3 cS 8 i.e2 tbc6?! (8 ... O-O! is the usual move, steering clear of dS). Now White can play 9 dS! i.xc3+ 10 i.d2 .i.xal 11 'iVxal tbd4 12 tbxd4 cxd4 13 ~xd4 with a strong attack. In our English Opening version, from the dia- gram after 7 ... bxc6, 8 i.gS d4 isn't what White wants, and he doesn't get anything meaningful by exchanging: 8 cxdS cxdS 9 i.g2 i.e6 10 O-O (10 i.gS d4!) 1O ... l:tc8. Now Black wants to play ... d4. White's natural response would be 11 ~a4+ (D).

(or even 17 ... l:thd8 18 'it'g2 i.b6) 18 l:tdll:tc2 19 a3 i.aS, etc. So the critical variation would seem to be 8 i.g2. The only book I've found that addresses 6 ... eS gives 8 ... i.e6 9 i.gS! here, when Black is already in poor shape. But knowing the reversed position, you can guess that Black should play 8 ... d4!

Then White's only try for an advantage is 9 i.xc6+ i.d7 10 i.xa8 (10 i.xd7+ 'iYxd7 11 ttJbl 'iYc6) 1O ... 'iYxa8 11 ttJdS ttJxdS 12 cxdS 'iYxdS. Black's f8-bishop is undeveloped, while it would be on e2 in the reversed line. That is a pure tempo-loss, and not some trade-off of time for information. Nevertheless, it doesn't seem serious enough to deny him counterplay: 13 f3 (130-0 i.h3 14 'iYa4+ 'it'e7 ISli'xa7+ 'it'e6 16 f3 i.xfl 17 'it'xfl i.d6 18 li'a6 fS is fine for Black) 13 ... i.d6 (or 13 ... i.cS 141i'b3 'iYd6) 14 '*lVb3 'iVc6 (or 14 .. :iVa8), intending some com- bination of ... O-O, ... l:tb8, .. :iVdS and ... i.bS. Of course there are plenty of other options. In any event, you could do worse than to study this variation, both for fun and in order to improve your understanding. The situation in- volving the bishop-pair as compensation for the exchange is ubiquitous in modem chess, and the English Opening player will always benefit from thinking about reversed positions. 7 ttJxc6 'iYxd1 + Black gets to simplify and force one of White's pieces back. Weaker is 7 ... bxc6 8 'iYa4 i.d7 9 i.g2 with O-O and '*lVxc4 to follow, be- cause White's queen is an annoyance.
B
8 ttJxdl! This knight will be excellently placed on e3. 8 ... bxc6 9 i.g2 (D) The queen exchange has resulted in a tech- nical position that may not rivet the average player's attention. White's strategy is to squeeze a win out of his pressure against Black's pawns on the open c-file. After one of those pawns falls, White hopes that the remaining isolated pawn will prove a weakness; remember that the squares in front of it can be safely occupied by a piece. One factor in Black's favour is that he will develop quickly and be in a better position to neutralize that advantage. After many years of experience, I think it's fair to say that the po- sition is objectively drawn, but that in practice, White will periodically eke out a win, espe- cially against someone who is not well pre- pared. What follows is not high theory, but hopefully represents the main ideas. 9 ... ttJdS! After 9 ... i.d7, 10 ..td2 l:tb8 11 .l:!.c1 and l:txc4 maintains the upper hand. 10 ttJe3 (D) 10•.• e6 A more active and perhaps satisfactory alter- native is 1O ... ..ta6 11 ttJxdS cxdS 12 i.xdS ':'c8; for example, 13 i.d2 e6 14 i.f3 i.cs IS i.c3 f6!

seems to equalize, intending 21 iLe2 iLd5. Con- sidering the elite players who use this line as White, however, it's probably not so easy. 11 lLlxe4 iLa6 (D) w 12lLla5 This move was given a firm '!' and enthusi- astic approval when it replaced years of prac- tice with 12 b3 and won a series of nice games for Kramnik, among others. Now some players, including Kramnik himself, are returning to 12 b3. The situation described above applies after that move as well: with careful play, Black's position is considered adequate to draw, but he has to work a bit. White had a slight but hardly decisive advantage after 12 ... iLb4+ 13 iLd2 iLxd2+ 14lLlxd2lLlb4 151it>dl O-O-O 16 a3lLld5 17 ~el ~b7 18 ~el e5 19 e3 in Kramnik- Leko, Misko1c 2007, and at this point Black can consider 19 ... lLle7, clearing d3 or 19 ... :the8 with the idea 20 iLfl?! iLxfl 21 ':!'xfl e4. Instead of all this, 12 ... l:i.c8! is a safe and constructive move, which both guards c6 and prepares the useful advance ... c5; for example, 13 iLd2 iLe7 14 iLaS 0-015 l::td1 iLd8 16 iLxd8 l::tfxd8 17 l::tel c5 (getting this move in usually solves most of Black's problems) 18 iLe4 iLxc4 19 bxc4lLlf6 20 iLd3 l::tb8 21 l::tc3 l::tb2 22 l::ta3 e5 23 f3 e4 24 fxe4 lLlg4 25 l::txa7 lLle5 26 O-O f6. Black has an immovable knight outpost ver- sus White's tragically placed bishop, Sebenik- Kreisl, Szeged 2007.

With this advance, White sidesteps the 'Bot- vinnik' line 3 ... e5, but Black's knight on c6 opens up some interesting possibilities. 3 ••• exd4 4lLlxd4 (D) 4 ... WVb6 This is one of Black's most important ways to bypass the main Four Knights lines which would follow the 'normal' continuation 4 ... lLlf6 5 lLlc3. If Black can get an acceptable game from the position after 4 .. :iVb6, it allows him to use 2 ... lLlc6 to avoid a few of the tougher lines that can arise if he plays 2 ... lLlf6, as described in the next section. One positive feature is that 4 .. :iVb6 forces an immediate response. I'm not going to cover this move in great detail but will show some general contours of the play. As always, Black has alternatives: MAIN LINES WITH 2 tDf3 AND d4 227
B
a) 4 ... e6 tends to transpose to other lines, but can produce unique play, such as after S ttJc3 ~b4!? (S ... ttJf6 is the Four Knights) or S g3 ~b4+!? 6 ttJc3 ~aS. Neither of these lines is a frequent choice of masters yet. A third an- swer to 4 ... e6 is S ttJbS; for example, S. .. d6 (or S ... ttJf6 6 ~f4 eS 7 ~gS 'iVaS+) 6 ~f4 (6 e4 transposes to the Taimanov Sicilian with S ttJbS d6 6 c4 - see Volume 1) 6 ... eS 7 ~g3lLlf6 8 ~h4!? (that's three moves for this one piece) 8 ... a6!? 9lLlSc3 (and four moves with this one! Surely Black cannot stand worse) 9 ... ~e7 10 e3, Bu Xiangzhi-Alekseev, China-Russia match, Nizhny Novgorod 2007.

O-O-O.
b) 4 ... g6 is seldom an independent continu- ation, and it permits White to play S e4, which is a Maroczy Bind Variation of the Sicilian and not to the taste of every defender. SlLlb3 a) S lLlc2 e6 6 g3 is slow. In cases where White's knight is on c2 instead of b3, the cus- tomary move is 6 ... ~cS !, with the idea of forc- ing light-square weaknesses upon White. Black will answer 7 e3 with 7 ... dS 8 cxdS exdS 9 ~g2 lLlf6. b) SlLlbS!? (D) expresses the idea that put- ting a knight on c3 will truly control dS and make the queen look a little funny out there on b6. bI) Now S. .. a6 6lLlSc3 e6 7 g3!? ~cS de- velops logically. Then 8 e3 ~c7 9 ~g2lLlf6 10 O-O O-O 11 b3 is strategically correct, but slow. For example, 11....l:!.d8 12 ~b2 dS! 13 cxdS exdS threatens ... d4, and if White sacrifices the

exchange for a pawn by 14 lLlxdS lLlxdS IS ~xdS ~h3 16 ~S!? ~xfl 17 ~e4 h6 18 ~xcS, simply 18 ... ~h3 survives in good shape. Therefore White might want to look into 8lLle4 lLlf6 9lLlxcs ~xcS instead, although he'll have to sacrifice a pawn, perhaps along the lines of 10 lLlc3 'iVxc4 11 ~g2. Then White has an at- tack based upon his bishop-pair and dark- square prospects, but Black has an impressive centre and, of course, an extra pawn. b2) Black usually chooses S ... lLlf6. One ex- ample went 6 g3!? a6 7lLlSc3lLleS 8 b3 ~c6 9 l:t.gl e6 10 ~g2 'Wic7 11 ~b2. In return for losing the castling privilege, White has developed ac- tively and controls space and the centre. The po- sition is still unclear (after all, White's king has nowhere to go), but this 1:!.gl idea (supporting g4-gS) has been a successful technique in simi- lar variations. In Gulko-Mekhitarian, Cali 2007, Black consolidated very sensibly: 11...~e7 12 lLld20-0 13l:t.c1 d6 14 h3 1:i.b8 IS f4!? lLlg6 16 e3 b6 17 ~e2 ~b7 with balanced play. S• •• e6 6 lLlc3 lLlf6 (D)
228 MASTERING THE CHESS OPENINGS
This is an extremely significant juncture. I apologize in advance for the following explana- tion, which is obscure-sounding but important to understand. In the position after 6 ... ltJf6, 7 g3 transposes to the Four Knights main line which goes 2ltJf3 ltJf6 3 d4 cxd4 4 ltJxd4ltJc6 5 ltJc3 e6 6 g3 'iWb6 7 ltJb3. If White chooses 7 a3 in- stead, that transposes to the other Four Knights variation with the same first five moves and then 6 a3 'ti'b6 7 ltJb3. With such options for White, it makes you wonder how 4 ... ~b6 could be an improvement over 4 ... ltJf6 5 ltJc3 e6 at all. The answer to that largely lies with your at- titude towards the independent and important option that White has in the main-line Four Knights that goes 2 ltJf3 ltJf6 3 ltJc3 ltJc6 4 d4 cxd4 5 ltJxd4 e6 6 g3 'iWb6, namely, 7 ltJdb5; see that section for the details. If you're happy meeting that move as Black, then you have less incentive to go with the 2 ... ltJc6 3 d4 cxd4 4 ltJxd4 'iWb6 move-order (which avoids it). This all sounds complicated until you put it on a board and see how easy the transpositions really are. Finally, after 4 ... ~b6 5 ltJb3 e6 6ltJc3 ltJf6, White also has the independent line played in this game: 7 e4!? .Bb4 8 .Be3!? There are plenty of options. 8 ••• .Bxc3+! 9 bxc3 'ti'c710 f3 d6 (D) w We shall see this structure in the main Four Knights lines. Black can target White's weak doubled c-pawns, as in the Nimzo-Indian De- fence and other openings. He has the right pieces to do it: a knight can go to e5, a bishop to a6, a rook to c8, and so forth. White, on the other hand, has the bishop-pair, space, and two potential structural ideas: c5, which activates his pieces, and g4-g5. llltJd4!? a6 Versus 12ltJb5, but now Black no longer has the idea of ... b6 with ... .Ba6.

Black seeks to set up a reversed Botvinnik structure, one of the main points of 2 ... ltJc6.
4 e3 (D)
This modest nudge of a pawn is the most se- rious independent challenge White can put to 3 ... e5, and it's the preference of many grand- masters. The fact that White hasn't played g3 MAIN LINES WITH 2 lDf3 AND d4 229 makes e3 followed by d4 a realistic plan. In- stead, 4 g3 g6 S .i.g2 .i.g7 would transpose to the normal Pure Symmetrical English variation B wi th S lL'lf3 eS.
B
4 ••• lL'lf6 This is the most effective way in which Black can contest the centre. a) 4 ... g6? S d4 cxd4 6 exd4 exd4 7lL'lxd4 al- ready puts Black in trouble due to his isolated d-pawn and weakness on d6.

White has a development lead and terrific squares for his pieces while Black has multiple internal weaknesses caused by the early ad- vance .. .fS. 5 d4 Or: a) Sometimes S a3 is played, as a sort of semi-waiting move, when White anticipates S. .. dS (I should point out that S ... .i.e7 is play- able, especially if 6 d4 cxd4 7 exd4 exd4 8 lL'lxd4 can be answered by 8 ... dS!, a move which has been neglected but seems all right; for ex- ample, 9 cxdS lL'lxdS 10 i.bS lL'lxc3 11 bxc3 .i.d7) 6 cxdSlL'lxdS (D).

Then White has two main moves: a1) 7 ~c2 is another reversed Taimanov Si- cilian position: all) If nothing else it permits the modest 7 ... lL'lxc3. Then 8 bxc3 (8 dxc3 .i.d6 is solid) 8 ... i.d6 can't be too bad for Black, because the move a3 is a bit wasted. On the other hand, for- mal advantage or not, White has some interest- ing possibilities. Apart from constructing a d3/c4 set-up, he can have some fun with a combination of i.d3, c4, l:'Lbl and i.e4 as ap- propriate, while an attack against the black king by h4 is not unthinkable. a12) More ambitious is 7 ... .i.e6!? 8 i.bS (again, 8 i.d3!? is an intriguing idea) 8 ... lL'lxc3 9 'iVxc3 f6, when 10 d3 is apparently better than

White has two bishops and Black has space. This position has been contested many times: a) 14 i.d2!? (White logically tries to move his bishop from c3, where it is blocked by the d4-pawn, to a diagonal upon which it can exert influence) 14 ... ~g6 15 i.f4 i.h3 (15 ... h5 is a good alternative) 16 i.g3 i.g4! 17 i.xg4ltJxg4 18 l:Iel l:Iad8 with approximate equality, Khar- lov-Yakovenko, Russian Team Ch, Sochi 2005. b) I won't go deeply into 14 ~c1 'ii'g6, but one theme to mention comes up after 15 'iVe3 (15 Wif4 h5 is standard) 15 ... i.g4 16l:tfe1 b5!? (D), played in Pachman-Ksieski, 2nd Bundes- liga 1994/5. This method of trying to eliminate White's c-pawn and win the d5-square is a recurring one in what I would call 'light-square' openings. For example, it happens in at least two varia- tions of the Slav Defence and in the main line (4 ... i.f5) of the Caro-Kann Defence, as well as in the Chigorin Defence to the Queen's Gam- bit, and lesser lines of the Queen's Gambit and the Nimzo-Indian Defence. In fact, most open- ings in which White plays d4 and c4 have at least one serious line in which Black's pawn advances to ... b5, especially if White has cas- tled queenside, in which case its effect is natu- rally multiplied. Although ... b5 is sometimes played as a pawn sacrifice (because possession of d5 is so important), here 17 cxb5 ltJd5 18 'iVd2 i.xe2 recovers the pawn with a great posi- tion in view of 19 'iVxe2ltJf4 20 'iVn cxb5. 7 ... i.h4 (D) This is precisely the position that arises from

6 cxd5 exd5 7 e5 ltJg4 8 i.b5, with colours re- versed but the same tempi. In fact, the analysis that follows will borrow from examples played with that move-order. Furthermore, it some- times arises from a Sicilian Defence: 1 e4 c5 2 ltJf3 e6 (or 2 ... ltJc6 3 c4, etc.) 3 c4ltJc6 4ltJc3 ltJf6 5 i.e2 d5, etc. These are sidelines, to be sure, but useful ones to be familiar with! Sd5 White almost has to play this, or be driven back by ... h6 and then lose the centre when Black plays ... d5. S• •• ltJe5 This variation as a whole is fascinating. 8 ... i.xc3+ 9 bxc3 ltJa5! is an important alter- native connected with some crazy and little- investigated tactics. White's natural response is 10 i.a3 (10 Wid4 has also been played), but

after 23 ... ~f5 (not 23 ... b4? 24 .i.d3!) 24 gxh6. This line with 8 ... .i.xc3+ 9 bxc3 ttJa5 should attract attacking types.

Having seen the important move 2 ... tbc6 and associated variations, we'll tum our attention to one of the grand old lines of the Symmetrical English, the Four Knights Variation with

development of his king's knight implies a fun- damental change of philosophy from 2 ... tbc6. This time the light squares d5 and e4 are his

focus, and a wide array of the variations follow- ing 2 ... ttJf6 involve the move ... d5, as early as move 3. The move ... e5, so often associated with 2 ... ttJc6, becomes a rare occurrence. 3 ttJc3 If you're following the multitudinous trans- positions in these chapters, it won't surprise you that 3 d4 cxd4 4 ttJxd4 can go various ways, including of course our main line with 4 ... ttJc6 5 ttJc3. I'll look at some independent alternatives in the Anti-Benoni section below. 3 ••• ttJc6 After 3 ... b6 4 e3!?, 4 ... ii.b7 5 d4 transposes to note 'b' on page 219, and 4 ... e6 is line 'b' of this note; both are pleasant for White. Now let's take a look at some move-orders after the much more important 3 ... e6 (D): w The lines that follow are of particular signifi- cance, because the choices made at this point can determine the underlying nature of the opening and middlegame. Both players need to know how to steer the game into the fundamen- tal variations that they wish to play: a) 4 g3 ttJc6 (Black has a certain control over his own destiny; for example, 4 ... b6 5 ii.g2 Jtb7 is a Hedgehog Variation of Chapter 10; and 4 ... d5 5 cxd5 exd5 6 d4 is a Queen's Gam- bit Declined, Tarrasch Variation; in this last line, 5 ... ttJxd5 6 d4 or 6 ii.g2 ttJc6 will usually transpose into the Keres-Parma Variation in Chapter 9) 5 ii.g2 (5 d4 cxd4 6 ttJxd4 is the main Four Knights line again) 5 ... d5 6 d4!? (once again, 6 cxd5 exd5 7 d4 is a Tarrasch De- fence, and 6 ... ttJxd5 a Keres-Parma Variation) 6 ... dxc4 7 'iVa4 cxd4!? (or 7 ... ~b6!?) 8 ttJxd4 ~xd4 9 ii.xc6+ ii.d7 (D). w Compare the Griinfeld Defence variation 1 d4 ttJf6 2 c4 g6 3 ttJc3 d5 4 ttJf3 ii.g7 5 e3 c5 6 dxc5 ~a5 7 cxd5 ttJxd5 8 ~xd5 ii.xc3+ 9 ii.d2. In our analogous situation (see the above dia- gram), Black's position is fine after 10 ii.xd7+ ~xd7 11 ~xc4 ':c8. O'Kelly de Galway-Mas- carifias, Jakarta 1978 continued 12 ~b3, and now 12 ... ii.e7 was adequate, but a more inter- esting continuation might be 12 .. . ii.c5!? 13 O-O O-O with the idea 14 ii.g5 ttJg4!? (or 14 ... ~c6 15 ii.xf6 gxf6 16 .:tacl ~b6 with equality) 15 lIadl ~c6 16 h3 h6!, preserving a lively imbal- ance. b) 4 e3 can be dull, but has a few subtleties. Usually the game goes 4 ... d5 5 d4 or 4 ... ttJc6 5 d4 d5, when we've arrived at the Symmetrical Tarrasch Queen's Gambit. To avoid this, Black sometimes risks 4 ... b6 5 d4 cxd4 (5 ... ii.b7?! 6 d5 blocks off the bishop on b7 and grabs space) 6 exd4 d5?! (D) (following the exchange on d4, 6 ... ii.b7 is now viable; although White still en- joys more space after a move like 7 ii.d3, he cannot easily execute the d5 advance). w MAIN LINES WITH 2 tDf3 AND d4 235 This can also come about by 1 c4 cS 2 liJf3 liJf6 3liJc3 b6 4 e3 e6 S d4 cxd4 6 exd4 dS.

However, it probably arises most of- ten from our move-order, and still more from a Queen's Gambit Semi-Tarrasch. So it's worth knowing that Black's position is terrible! A strong solution is 7liJeS! i.e7 (7 ... liJbd7 8 "iVa4 i.b7 9 cxdS exdS 10 i.d3 a6 11 O-O with a clearly superior game; 7 ... a6 8 cxdS liJxdS 9 "iVa4+ i.d7 10 liJxd7 liJxd7 11 liJxdS exdS 12 i.xa6!, Kharitonov-Ballo, Stockholm 1998, and Black can't exploit the bishop's position; for example, l2. . :iVc7 13 'ikbS!

Perhaps that will interest 1 e4 players. In any event, White intends 6 d4 cxd4 7 liJxd4, when i.e2 becomes a normal and useful move. Here S ... liJd4 6 eS! is undesirable, and S ... ~b6 is an uninspiring, if perfectly respect- able, option. So the most popular and challeng- ing line has been S ... dS 6 cxdS (6 exdS exdS 7 d4 is Ivanchuk-Anand on page 230; after 6 eS, 6 ... liJg4 7 cxdS exdS will transpose, while 6 ... liJe4 can be met by 7 i.d3 fS!? or 7 O-O i.e7 8 ~c2!? liJgS! 9 liJxgS i.xgS 10 cxdS exdS 11 f4liJd4 12 'iVa4+ i.d7 13 ~dl with a messy po- sition) 6 ... exdS 7 eSliJg4 8 i.bS!

236 MASTERING THE CHESS OPENINGS
Finally, we've arrived at the Four Knights Symmetrical Variation, the traditional main line arising from 2liJf3 with an early d4. A warning: the subject-matter of this chapter can be sophisticated in terms of theory and analysis at some points. When the material be- comes too dense, the less advanced reader may wish to follow the general ideas and enjoy the games rather than get tangled up in specifics. S•.• e6 (D) This is by far the most frequently chosen move. There are some irregular possibilities such as S .. :iVb6 which I won't give details about, but see the section above about 2 ... liJc6 3 d4 cxd4 4liJxd4 'iiVb6 for some possible transpo- sitions. Finally, I should mention that S. .. eS!? (which is very rarely played) could be a better option than thought, because 6liJdbS d6 7 .ligS transposes to S ... e6 6liJdbS d6 7 .lif4 eS 8.ligS below. Of course, White can look into other 7th moves, including 7 e4, which is a Kalashnikov Sicilian. In general, the Four Knights Variation embraces such disparate types of positions that the best way to describe it is by showing games. w Four Knights with 6 a3 Yakovenko - Moiseenko European Ch, Dresden 2007
1 c4 cS 2 liJf3liJc6 3 d4 cxd4 4 liJxd4liJf6 S
liJc3 e6 6 a3 (D) This odd-looking move, which was essen- tially ignored for most of the rich history of this variation, has grown in importance. Much of this has to do with White's frustrations in the old main line after 6 g3 ~6 7 liJb3 .lib4, al- though it must be said that players are still will- ing to contest that position and it has its own unexplored paths, as we shall see below.
B
In modem chess, there has been an increased use of the 'little moves' a3 and ... a6 (as well as h3 and ... h6) in many contexts; a common theme is that they serve as 'useful' semi-waiting moves. The utility of 6 a3 is largely preventa- tive, in that 6 ... .lib4 is averted, but there are a few other ideas associated with it. For example, you will see that a standard pawn-structure for Black involves ... d6 and ... b6 (the 'hedgehog' formation), against which White will set up a large centre with c4 and e4. A standard theme in such positions, and in fact the primary way for White to make progress, is to advance on the queenside with b4, for which 6 a3 is useful. The good news from Black's point of view is that 6 a3 is a slow move that does nothing for White's development. Furthermore, it creates a hole on b3. In general, White's c-pawn, which tends to be an important target in the Four Knights, will be more easily attackable. That is certainly the case if White plays b4, leaving it with no pawn defenders. 6 ••• liJxd4 6 ... dS!? 7 cxdS exdS 8 .ligS (D) gives White a nice isolated queen's pawn formation in which his knight blockades the d-pawn and he reaches the favourable set-up with .ligS and e3. The only problem is that a3 is almost a waste of a move here, so Black can play unusually ag- gressively by 8 ... .licS (a routine demonstration of White superiority was 8 ... .lie7 9 e3 O-O 10 MAIN LINES WITH 2 C{jf3 AND d4 237 ~bS! ttJeS 11 O-O a6 12 ~e2 ~e6 13 ~3 bS 14 l:;ladl with great piece coordination, Kra- senkow-Mamedyarov, European Ch, Antalya 2004) 9 e3 O-O. In Van Wely-Ivanchuk, Foros 2007, White continued 10 ~e2 ~xd4 11 exd4 h6 12 ~h4 'ii'd6 13 ~g3 'ii'e7 140-0 ttJe4 IS l:;lc1 (or IS .l:i.el ttJxg3 16 hxg3 followed by ~f3, which leaves White with some pressure on dS) IS ... ttJxc3 16 .l:i.xc3 ~f6, and here Van Wely suggests 17 ~f3 with some advantage due to his relatively active bishop-pair. 7 ~xd4 b6 (D) w What do we think of Black's exchange on move 6? On the positive side, Black gets rid of White's knight on d4, a centralized piece that has moved twice, while bringing White's queen onto a square on which it will probably be at- tacked. The move ... b6 can also serve to prepare ... ~cS as well as to discourage g3. But from White's point of view, the exchange has not been a bad thing. First, it brought the queen out for free, so that if it has to move again, that's no real loss of tempo, especially if White can choose the square it goes to. More generally, in a hedgehog position in which White has more space (for example, with c4 and e4), exchanges tend to favour him. Specifically, when Black swaps pieces the possibility of dynamic coun- terattacks based upon ... dS and ... bS breaks is reduced, because their success often depends upon attack by a maximum number of Black's forces. You will find that, contrary to the old saw about exchanges favouring the side with less space, they favour the side with more space quite as often. 8 iYf4! In view of the above, we shouldn't be too surprised by this move, which anticipates the attack by ... ~cS and prepares e4. 8 iVd3 is sometimes played with the same idea, but the queen has less influence from that spot. What about 8 e4? The move is hardly a blunder, yet it encourages Black to take the initiative, and White's queen will end up on a passive square.

238 MASTERING THE CHESS OPENINGS
Black wants to control as many dark squares as possible, and ... ttJh5-f4 becomes a theme (af- ter preparation).

White is not really expecting Black to miss 12 fixg7#, or to lose material after ll...g6 12 i.xf8.

But if he plays 11 i.d3 first, Black can reply ll...ttJd7!, with the idea of jumping to e5, to harass White's bishop and c4-pawn, or transferring to c5 as ap- propriate.

Black would like to maximize his pieces' in- fluence and then break with ... bS or ... dS. White, as usual, will look to central play and queenside expansion. Since only the latter looks available, MAIN LINES WITH 2 tDf3 AND d4 241 the plan will be to play b4, supporting the moves cS and/or a4-aS with rooks and pieces. 1l. .. l:!.e8 ... lZ'leS-d7 is a standard reorganization in the hedgehog formation (whether a Sicilian De- fence or English Opening) and is available here because of the tactical fact that White's e-pawn is loose.

White moves his knight a second time in or- der to target d6 and c7. He intends to follow that up with 7 iLf4, increasing the pressure on those squares. 6 lZ'ldbS isn't as popular among lead- ing grandmasters as other moves, but in part that's due to the relatively uncharted complexi- ties of 6 a3 and a couple of the newer lines stemming from 6 g3. 6 lZ'ldbS should attract positionally-minded players who are comfort- able with slowly-developing play, and/or those of a less theoretical bent. Black, of course, needs to know this line: first, to survive early threats, and then, to avoid being squeezed to death. Ki. Georgiev - Topalov Sarajevo 2000 6 ... dS (D) This is the most established move, but the al- ternatives in the next game are important and inviting, because they avoid the endgame that almost always arises after 6 ... d5.

242 MASTERING THE CHESS OPENINGS
w In view of the threat of 7 ... d4, White forces the pace. The first thing that an experienced player will see is that he can win a pawn with the familiar trick 7 cxdS liJxdS (7 ... exd5? 8 iLf4) 8 liJxdS exdS 9 'iVxdS, intending 9 ... 'iixdS 10 liJc7+ and liJxdS. However, as in many openings in which this trick is possible, the purported victim of the trick is actually sacrificing a pawn for activity and attack. After 9 ... iLb4+ 10 iLd2 Black gets full compensation in two ways: a) With 10 ... O-O, Black can whip up an at- tack in the queenless middlegame following 11 'iixd8 .ti.xd8 12 O-O-O!? iLe6! 13 a3? iLb3! 14 axb4, and now 14 ... a5! is a killing shot, tak- ing over the a-file, but Black also won with 14 ... liJxM 15liJc3 .ti.ac8 16 .ti.elliJc2 17l:!.dl liJb4 181:tel ':c5! 0-1 in Nyback-Lehikoinen, Stockholm 2003; in the final position .. .lIa5 and mate is threatened, and White will have to give up massive material to prevent it. b) 1O .. :~e7 11liJc3?!

"iVxb4+ ends in mate, and at the very least, Black can play ... liJxa2 and win White's c- pawn as well. 7 ... e5 (D) Black's attack on the bishop leads to a series of captures which results in gaining the bishop- pair, at the cost of a weakening of his pawn- structure and displacement of his king. It turns out that other counterattacking options simply don't suffice. Scxd5 w 8 iLg5 is slow, especially because of the trick 8 ... d4 9liJd5? liJxd5! 10 iLxd8iLb4+; then 11 ~d2 is forced, in view of llliJc3? dxc3 12 a3 c2+. S. •. exf4 9 dxc6 bxc610 'iixdS+ 'iii>xdS (D) w This queenless middlegame has been con- tested over many years. Sometimes it's called 'drawish', but this only means that at the very top levels, grandmasters on either side of the board find it hard to get as many winning chances as they'd like, in particular compared with the moves 6 a3 and 6 g3. That's not really saying much, and the average player will have plenty of chances to win with either colour. Right off we have the radical difference in pawn-structures, with Black's isolated c- and a-pawns, and his funny pawn on f4 that can be either weak or strong. Then there is the issue of whether White's quick development by O-O-O+ or .l::!.dl + is enough to disrupt his opponent's game. Black's play stems from the fact that if White's knight on b5 retreats, he gets to keep MAIN LINES WITH 2 tDf3 AND d4 243 the bishop-pair; or, if White puts the knight on d6, Black will gain time by exchanging it and playing on the open files by ... J:Ib8 and ... .l:!.e8. Under some circumstances, the move ... liJg4 will be relevant, especially if White castles queenside.

244 MASTERING THE CHESS OPENINGS
w Attacking d6 is the only independent attempt to punish Black's move-order, since 7 .i.g5 a6 8 .i.xf6 gxf6 is a standard position in which Black stands no worse. However, 7 e4 is a Taimanov Sicilian Defence, a possibility which should be taken into account by both players. 7 ••• e5 8 .i.g5 (D)
B
This .i.f4-g5 manoeuvre is a standard tech- nique in several modem opening lines, most fa- mously the Sveshnikov Variation of the Sicilian Defence (if reached via the sequence 1 e4 c5 2 tiJf3 e6 3 d4 cxd4 4 tiJxd4 tiJf6 5 tiJc3 tiJc6 6 tiJdb5 d6 7 .i.f4 e5 8 i..g5). White controls the d5-square. However, many of today's openings exploit the fact that a single outpost, however strong, doesn't necessarily produce a superior game, even in the absence of a similar weak- ness on the other side. There are multiple rea- sons for this, the most common one being that the opponent can work around the centre to un- dermine the pawn-supports for that outpost (this is best shown by example). Furthermore, the exchange of a piece occupying an outpost sometimes forces a pawn recapture, filling the hole there. Thus the very threat of exchange can force one's opponent to retreat. The classic ex- amples of this situation arise in the Sicilian De- fence and English Opening (see the various Botvinnik-structure lines in this book), but you will also run into it in other e- and d-pawn openings. After 8 .i.g5, in face of the positional threat of 9 tiJd5 followed by 10 tiJbc3, Black should kick the knight. 8 ••• a69.i.xf6 As in the Sveshnikov, White can maintain the tension by 9 tiJa3 (D).

Black has a choice of ways to divert White from his positional goals; for example: a) S.Emst-Leenhouts, Dutch Team Ch 2007/8 continued 9 ... .i.e6 10 'iVd2 (or 10 e3) 1O ... .i.e7

But the dynamism in Black's position might be better illustrated by 17 ... tiJd4!?, threat- ening ... b5; for example, 18 e3 tiJf5 19 tiJc2! b5! 20 cxb5 d5 21 tiJc3 d4 22 exd4 exd4 23 tiJe4 axb5 24 tiJxd4 tiJxd4 25 ~xd4 'iVxd4 26 ':xd4l:tc2. b) The position after 9 ... .i.e7 10 e3 O-O 11 .i.e2 .i.e6 12 O-O has been reached more than once.

W
This advance is seen in the main lines of the Sveshnikov Sicilian, but in our game White has played c4 instead of e4, so there are very differ- ent methods of play. It's worth noting that, by having played c4, White has stopped the move ... bS, crucial in the Sveshnikov, and made the manoeuvre ltJc2-e3 easier. However, he's also given Black squares on b4 and d4 to play around with and most importantly, a target on c4. 11 g3 White increases his control over dS and se- cures a good square for his bishop. This is dou- ble-edged, since it removes a defender from c4 and takes two moves to implement. Some ex- amples will give a feel for the play: a) 11 e3 iLe6 12 ~d2 iLg7! 13 O-O-O "iVaS prevents 14 ~xd6?? due to 14 ... .l:.d8, and 14 ltJdsllVxd2+ IS1:!.xd2 O-O-O was equal in V.Zil- berstein-Lein, USSR Ch, Baku 1972. b) I1ltJc2 is a productive-looking strategy, intending ltJe3-dS with a dominant outpost; for example, ll...iLg7 12 ltJe3 O-O 13 ltJed5 iLe6 14 e3. However, as I pointed out above, this is by no means a guarantee of having the better game. Here Black got sufficient counterplay in A.N.Panchenko-Z.Almasi, Budapest 1991 by means of the characteristic ... bS break: 14 ... l:!.c8 IS iLe2 e4! 16 O-O !

A thematic advance. At what point Black should play ... e4, if at all, constitutes one of the most important decisions in this variation. For one thing, Black thereby gives up the f4- square to a knight or another piece, as well as making d4 available for occupation. He fur- ther weakens his pawn on fS, in that it can't ad- vance and will therefore become more of a target. Finally, Black potentially allows White the option of f3, which may favourably change the pawn-structure for White. On the positive side, Black's g7-bishop gains tremendously in scope, and can also come to eS to defend the d6-pawn. Black's knight gains access to that same new square eS from which to attack c4 and oversee the critical d3- and

f3-squares. Lastly, his e4-pawn disables White's g2-bishop.It's remarkable that the positive and negative features of the e-pawn advance are so delicately balanced; in fact, the overall evalua- tion of the position before and after 14 ... e4 tends to be the same! 15 ~fdl 'tWa5 16 lbd5 White goes for the ending. Again, this seems to be a value-neutral transformation: each side's positional advantages persist as though noth- ing has happened. An obvious alternative is 16 ~ac1, when 16 ... ~ac8 17 ~h3?!

This will often lead to positions with the queens off the board. At first, it may seem that the game becomes insufficiently difficult to offer substantial winning chances. However, players below grandmaster level will still be rewarded for outplaying their opponents. The larger issue is whether you have a taste for the slow nature of the line: a) 8 4.Jc7?? eS! 9 4.Jxa8 exf4 will not only win two pieces for a rook for Black (after the knight on a8 falls), but do so in a position where Black comes out with better development and the initiative. b) 8 i.c7 is the 'drawish' move: 8 ... ~e7 9 i.d6 i.xd6 10 'iVxd6 'iVd8!

(D) When I first saw this position recommended for Black, I was incredulous. It's precisely the one arising from 1 c4 c5 2 ttJf3 ttJf6 3 ttJc3 d5 4 cxd5 ttJxd5 (this is an Asymmetrical Variation from Chapter 9) 5 e4 ttJb4 6 ii.c4 ii.e6!? (an older move; the well-known one is 6 ... ttJd3+) 7 ii.xe6 ttJd3+ 8 'it>fl fxe6 9 ttJg5, with colours reversed, but White is a tempo ahead! We've seen that in many reversed positions in chess, the 'extra' move for one side is passive or overcommittal in the context of the larger vari- ation, but in this particular line (with 6 ttJdb5 .i.c5 7 ii.f4 e5 8 ii.e3), the extra move is ttJc3 (i.e., ... ttJc6 is missing in the Asymmetrical line). You could hardly have a more perfect move for a bonus: it eyes the forward outpost on d5, can come to the defence of the vulnera- ble point at f2, and prepares for O-O-O. Defying logic, however, Black's position has its own resiliency. By analogy with the reversed-colour situation, the move ... Wif6 is Black's key to counterplay, but here it does nothing useful after ttJce4. So he resorts to the moves .. :it'g5 and ... h5. Naturally, those moves reflect the new reality that Black is to some extent defending instead of attacking, and that the move ... h5 is associated with ... .l:i.h6 and ... .l:!.xd6, ridding Black of his most deadly enemy at the cost of the exchange. Very likely White can come out with some advan- tage here, but it's still surprising that such a line isn't refutable and has in fact scored well for Black. 11 ~d2 By way of illustration, one of Black's moves with a tempo less is 9 ... ~b6, but after the analo- gous 11 ~b3 in our position, the 'bonus' knight MAIN LINES WITH 2 CiJf3 AND d4 249 on c3 gets in the way of the white queen's protection of e3, so Black can capture the pawn by 11...tZJxe3, and if 12 c5, 12 ...

White gets on with his development and places the bishop in its customary place in the English Opening, along the long diagonal. Of course, the bishop takes two moves to get to g2, so the dynamic idea of ... d5 must be taken into ac- count. In reality, since that problem proves manageable, White's most serious difficulty is with his c-pawn, which becomes vulnerable to attack. 6 ••• .lic5 When examining any of the Four Knights lines, one of the first things to check is whether Black can successfully free his game by means of ... d5. An initially popular way of doing so was 6 ... .lib4 7 .lig2 O-O 8 O-O d5, when the best line is 9 cxd5 exd5 10 .lie3 hte8 (this is tradi- tionally queried, with 10 ... .lixc3 11 bxc3 given and agreed to yield White an edge; then moves like ~bl, 'ilVa4 and htfdl would be part of an ef- fective strategy) 11 .l:tc1 .i.g4!? (D). w We are following Portisch-Donner, Santa Monica 1966, the game that more or less laid this line to rest. It continued 12 'ilVb3!?, a clever pawn sacrifice which has variously been given one or two exclamation marks. The game con- tinued 12 ... .lixc3 13 lIxc3liJxd4 14 .lixd4 .lixe2 15 .l::!.fcl and White had a harmonious position with multiple threats for a mere pawn. After 15 ... liJe4 16 'fJ.c7? .lia6? 17 "iWf3! liJg5 18 'ilVf5 .lic4 191Ixb7, Black was positionally lost. But trust the computers to spoil another classic. Mine instantly finds 16 ... .lic4!, refuting the line, based upon 17 "iVxb7liJd6 18 'iVc6liJb5 or 17 .l:tlxc4liJd2! and wins. Instead of 16 .u.c7, 16 'fJ.e3 .lia6 17 f3 would have given White com- pensation for his pawn, but no more than that. But surely White had a favourable isolated queen's pawn position at move 12? I think so; after 12 h3! .lih5 (12 ... .lixc3 13 ~xc3liJxd414 hxg4! liJc6 15 .lig5 and White will safely win the d-pawn) 13 g4.lig6, 14 ~b3! (this version of Portisch's idea seems to work) 14 ... .lixc3 15 ~xc3 liJxd4 16 .lixd4 ~xe2 17 ~dl really is difficult for Black; for example, 17 ... liJe4 (not 17 ... .lie4? 18 .lin) 18 ~e3 ~xe3 19 .lixe3 and after winning the d-pawn White will retain his bishops and initiative. 7 liJb3 .lie7 (D) w Black embarks upon a strategy that applies to a variety of positions, including the Sicilian De- fence. He first drives the knight from the centre and then puts the bishop where he wants it any- way, on e7. The issue, obviously, is whether White's knight is better placed on d4 or b3. There's no easy answer. On d4 the knight is better centralized and looks into key points in Black's position such as c6 and e6. It works with the bishop on g2 to prevent ... d6, a key part of Black's intended set-up. On the other hand, you could also argue that because of Black's pawn-structure, the knight on d4 was restricted from all potential entry points (especially since ... a6 is generally played at the first moment when liJdb5 could become relevant). It might be compared with a knight on d4 in a Taimanov or Kan Variation of the Sicilian Defence. Thus a case can be made for the decentralized and su- perficially less influential knight on b3. One non-trivial consideration concerns Black's own freeing moves, namely, that ... d5 is now pre- vented and that ... e5 won't come with tempo. The knight on b3 may also come in handy MAIN LINES WITH 2 tiJj3 AND d4 251 supporting the move c5, although that is not a vital argument in its favour. As one more illustration of the maddening plasticity of this opening, the game before you really opened I d4 lbf6 2 c4 c5 3 lbf3 cxd4 4 lbxd4 e6 (now it's an English Opening) 5 g3 lbc6 6 i.g2 i.c5 7 lbb3 i.e7 8 lbc3, and now it's a Four Knights Symmetrical English! 8 i.g2 O-O (D) The enterprising 8 ... b6 is premised upon 9 O-O O-O 10 i.f4 i.a6! 11 lbb5 d5! 12 lbc7 i.xc4!, gaining a strong mobile centre and a pawn for the exchange. There are several alter- natives, but it might be that exploiting the pin to return to the centre by 10 lbd4 is worthwhile, with the idea 1O ... i.b7 11 lbdb5 d6 12 i.g5 a6 13 i.xf6, etc.

90-0 d6 Black sidesteps the positional error 9 ... a6?, when White plays 10 c5!. 10 i.f4lbh5!? With 'iid2 (or 'i1rVc2) and ':fdl in the air, Black goes after the bishop. Two other ideas are 1O ... lbg4!? with the idea ... lbge5, and 1O ... h6!?, thinking about ... e5 and ... i.e6 (without having to face i.g5). 11 e3! The voluntary acceptance of doubled f-pawns has popped up from time to time throughout this book. Of course, 11 i.e3 can't be bad.

White's two forward bishops' pawns contest the same squares as Black's centre pawns and, at least

temporarily, his bishop on g2 and rooks coming to the centre files will be superior to their coun- terparts. Black will have a hard time achieving freeing breaks, and ... d5 appears particularly hopeless. Nevertheless, he can (and does) pre- pare ... b5, if only to force White to make the weakening move a4. His other natural idea would be to occupy the c-file and target the c- pawn. What are White's plans? It will be difficult to put pressure on d6 with his dark-squared bishop gone, but an attack by f5 is the logical way to make progress. If Black responds by ... e5, he gives White an outpost on d5, but oth- erwise White will play fxe6 and either win the d5-square (if Black captures with his bishop) or create a weak pawn on e6 on an open central file if Black plays ... fxe6. That pawn on e6 is easily attacked by a rook on el, knight on d4 and bishop on h3. Naturally this strategy won't be implemented so easily, but the idea of allow- ing the bishop to be captured on f4 has become standard in similar positions. In lines of the Queen's Indian Defence which involve ... i.xf3 and exf3, for example, f4-f5 is played for the same reasons. 12• •• i.d7 13 ~d2 'iVb8 141::[fel g6 For the reasons given above, Black wants to stop f5.

In the last game, we discussed the pros and cons of having the knight on b3.

At any rate, the game is soon ruled by spe- cifics. 7 •.• lbe5 MAIN LINES WITH 2 tDj3 AND d4 253 Over the years, this has always been the main move, because it forces a favourable change of structure. To understand why practice has grav- itated in this direction, a cursory examination of the two very natural alternatives won't hurt: a) 7 ... dS is no longer popular, but has been used in the World Championship and other ma- jor contests.

w For some reason 14 O-O has been neglected here. Perhaps White has been afraid of 14 ... lbg4, but IS .i.c1 preserves the bishop, which might even come out to a3 after Black's knight is driven away. I think that this deserves close consideration and may be White's best route to advantage. Instead, practice has seen: a) 14 cS dxcS IS i.xcS can be countered by IS ... i.g4, when Smejkal-Gdanski, Polanica Zdroj 1991 continued 16 ~e3 b617 i.a3 O-O-O with full equality.

The position of each side's opposite-coloured bishop is more important than any other consid- eration here, because they can be neither op- posed nor exchanged off without material loss. 21 i-c5 Transferring to d4. 21 .l:txa7?? is a blunder due to 2l...d4; Ribli gives 21 i-d6 'iWc6 22 'iVd4, but White could be tied down after 22 ... .l:tdc8 23 'it'd2 a5, when Black has prospects of slip- ping into the light squares by ... i-e4, ... h5-h4 and a queen transfer by ...

Now this bishop is restricted by its own cen- tre pawns. 22 •• :iVd7 You can already envision a formation with Black's bishop on e4, his queen on h3 or f5, and ... h5-h4, with the rooks to follow. 230-0 .l:tac8 (D) 24l:tf2 i-e4 251i'e2 .l:tc6! 261'kb5 Ribli makes the excellent suggestion that White flee back to the centre by ~fl-e1-d2, al- though it wouldn't be perfectly secure there.

Castling is more flexible than 14 cS. In re- cent years, White hasn't entered into this posi- tion much, in spite of decades of practice at the highest levels. That may be a function of the relative difficulty of attack and defence. Theory cites games suggesting that Black stands better; objectively, however, I think that White has im- provements and a definitive assessment is prac- tically impossible to arrive at. 14• •• b6 This variation can be productively compared to the Samisch Variation of the Nimzo-Indian Defence (1 d4 ttJf6 2 c4 e6 3 ttJc3 .Bb4 4 a3 .Bxc3+ S bxc3, in Volume 2), and other branches of that opening. As in the Nimzo-Indian, White has two bishops and kingside prospects (g4- gS), but his doubled c-pawns are targets and Black is able to train several pieces on the c-file and eventually wins at least one pawn ( ... .Ba6, ... ttJaS, .. :ikc7 and .. Jbc8). White will try to mix things up in both the centre and kingside. As so often when one side has two bishops and weaknesses, he is willing to jettison a pawn in exchange for extra time to pursue his attack . The blocking move 14 ... eS seems premature after IS fS, although that's not entirely clear. Moutousis-Wojtkiewicz, Athens 1992 was a di- saster for Black following IS ... b6 16 g4 .Ba6 17 gS ttJe8? (Anand gives 17 ... ttJd7) 18:f3 ttJaS?

The game could end with 23 ... 'iiith7 24 .in 'ilc6 2S fxg6+ fxg6 26 ~e7+. 15 g4 For a while, White turned to the alternative IS ttJd4. It threatens 16 ttJxc6 and prepares ttJbS. But Black has a surprise retort: IS ... ttJxd4! (it seems contradictory to straighten out White's pawns, even should Black manage to win the pawn on c4) 16 cxd4 .Ba6 (D). w Now Black threatens not only the c-pawn, but ... dS. We saw in the Samisch Variation of the Nimzo-Indian how Black could straighten out White's c-pawns by ... cxd4, and after cxd4, play ... dS. Carlsen-Volokitin, Biel 2006 continued 17 :tac1?!

15 •.. .Bb7 This is the accepted solution, resisting ... .Ba6 for a few moves so as to keep an attack on White's centre, which in tum helps Black de- fend against the kingside attack. lS ... .Ba6 has a mediocre reputation. Black may be able to hold his own in that line as well, but he has to be very careful; for example, 16 gS tDd7 17 1:1f3 l:!.fe8 18 l:!.h3 tDf8, and here Lobron-Hulak, Erevan Olympiad 1996 saw 19 fS! tDeS 20 ~hS 'lWxc4. At this point, instead of 21 .Bd4? ~e2! 22 'ifh4 "iVg4!, when White's attack dissipated, the stan- dard attack by 21 f6! is promising, because 2l...~e2 22 fxg7 ~xg7 23 ~h6+ ~g8 24 .Bd4 or even 24 g6!? gives White positive chances, the latter line proceeding 24 ... fxg6 2S .ifl ~g4+ 26 l:tg3 .ixfl! 27 kIxg4 tDxg4 28 ~f4 tDxe3 29 ~xe3 .Ba6 30 ~d4.

White's fS, Black will answer ... exfS and have another piece in play.

But here White had 21 fS!, which is quite dangerous in compar- ison with White's attack in the main line. b) Illescas-Leko, Leon 1996 went 17 ... .l:r.ac8 18l:!.h3 .ti.fe8! 19 ~hS?! tDf8 20 lUI!? .Ba6!, and Black got the better of it. However, 19 l:td1 ! is an improvement, when things are by no means clear. White should hang around in the centre for a while in these positions, taking advantage of the weakness on d6 and holding c4 for a while. There is time for fS later. 18 .l:i.h3 tDf8 (D)
19 Itfl?!
For the last time, White should act in the cen- tre until Black shifts either his bishop to a6 or knight to as, which both make fS more effective;

White embarks upon a completely different plan: to keep his pawn-structure intact and cas- tle queenside, with the idea of simplifying and putting pressure on Black's d-pawn. The dan- ger is that his king will become exposed on the queenside.

For some reason, it took a long time for this dynamic move to catch on; presumably there was a fear that the knight had no plausible re- treat-square, or simply that the tactics were un- favourable. At any rate, White has a few simple ideas: .lif4, ltJd6+, or some combination of .lie3 and ltJa4 to drive the queen back. Black can take comfort in the fact that 7 ltJdb5 takes a tempo from White's development, and that un- like 7ltJb3, it lets a bishop settle in on c5, when White's f2-pawn is more of a target. 7 ..• ltJe5!? This has always been the most important re- ply, covering d6 and creating the immediate threat of ... ltJxc4. In addition, the c6-square is cleared, potentially for the queen.

This is a radical and aggressive approach that is normally associated with a pawn sacri- fice. A pair of other moves can go in the Anti- Benoni category: a) The infrequently-played 4 ... a6!? (D) has the idea of either S ... eS, now that ttJbS isn't pos- sible, or S ... dS. w It is not easy for White to get an edge, but a good try is S ttJc3 dS (S ... eS 6 ttJc2 ttJc6 7 g3 i.cs 8 i.g2 O-O 9 O-O gives White the upper hand because control of dS hasn't cost him any- thing in the way of positional concessions) 6 ttJf3! dxc4 (6 ... e6 7 cxdS exdS 8 i.gS i.e6 9 e4!? dxe4 10 'tlVxd8+ ~xd8 11 ttJd4100ks good for White) 7 'ikxd8+ ~xd8 8 e4! e69 ttJeS ~e8 10 ttJxc4 with the advantage (and incidentally exploiting the hole on b6 created by 4 ... a6), Olafsson-Miles, Teesside 1975. b) 4 ... e6 S ttJc3 (D) is highly transposi- tional, with some unique possibilities.
B
I'm not going to investigate these in depth, but here are some guideposts: bl) S. .. i.b4 6 g3 is a Nimzo-Indian Defence. For reasons of space, I'll have to refer you to the theory and practice of that line. At present, Black seems to be holding his own. White has other moves such as 6 e3, 6 ttJc2 and 6 i.d2 which are passive or unimportant. Somewhat more challenging is 6 ttJbS, although there is more than one good reply. One is 6 ... dS!, which forces White to react; for example, 7 i.f4 (7 cxdS exdS 8 i.f4 O-O has the idea 9 ttJc7? ttJhS) 7 ... O-O 8 e3 ttJc6 (or 8 ... a6 9 a3 i.aS 10 ttJd6 i.c7!?) 9 a3 i.aS 10 b4 a6 11 cxdS exdS 12 bxaS axbS 13 i.xbS ~xaS with equality, Olafs- son-Gipslis, Reykjavik 19S7. b2) Black can also play S. .. a6, after which 6 e4 is a Sicilian Defence, Kan Variation, and 6 g3 can lead to unique positions; for example, after 6 ... 'tlVc7, White often gambits his c-pawn by 7 i.gS 'iixc4 8 .l::tc 1. I'll leave that for you to study. b3) That leaves S ... dS 6 cxdS, when Black should shun 6 ... exdS, because 7 i.gS is a good version for White of the Queen's Gambit De- clined. However, 6 ... ttJxdS may be satisfactory, when Hansen thinks Black stands all right after 7 ttJdbS a6 or 7 i.d2 i.e7 (or here 7 ... i.cS). c) Black can aim for an Accelerated Fian- chetto Maroczy Bind by 4 ... g6, to which White MAIN LINES WITH 2 ti:Jj3 AND d4 265 can acquiesce by 5 ttJc3 .Bg7 6 e4 ttJc6. But you should note that 7 ttJc2 denies Black the popular lines which involve ... ttJxd4, so he may B lack motivation to play this move-order. Other- wise, 5 g3 (or 5 ttJc3 ttJc6 6 g3) 5 ... .Bg7 6.Bg2 ttJc6 7 ttJc3 transposes to the Pure Symmetrical line of Chapter 7, which goes 1 c4 c5 2 ttJc3 ttJc6 3 g3 g64 .Bg2 .Bg7 5 ttJf3 ttJf6 6 d4 cxd4 7 ttJxd4. 5 ttJb5 (D)
B
White plays the most consistent and ambi- tious move, trying to exploit Black's weakness on d6. Against other moves Black can develop rapidly and easily. Nevertheless, White must now deal with a fairly effective pawn sacrifice: 5 •.. d5!? Actually, the very rare 5 ... d6 could use some tests, with the idea 6 .Bg5 .Be6. 6 cxd5 .Bc5 Not 6 ... ttJxd5?? 7 ~xd5 'iUxd5 S ttJc7+. 7 ttJ5c3 7 d6?! is too ambitious: 7 ... O-O! S ttJc7 ttJe4!

8. .. e4 (D)

What does Black have for a pawn? In the first place, his pawn on e4 is a wedge that cramps White's pieces. Because of the territory that it stakes out, White will always have to accept some risks if he castles. That is, Black has a va- riety of ways to attack a castled king in these kinds of positions; for example, ... l;I.eS, ... ~e5 intending ... .Bd6 or ... ~g5, ... .Bf5 followed by ... ttJbd7-e5, attacks with ... h5, and so forth . Which is not to say that the counterattacking moves a3, M, .Bb2 and ttJd2-c4 won't elimi- nate that attack before it gets going, merely that many players of White have been blown away without making obvious mistakes. Thus we'll usually see White making at least some of his
266 MASTERING THE CHESS OPENINGS
queenside moves before castling. Another fac- tor here is that White's d-pawn is vulnerable to various attacks, including ... ttJbd7-b6 and/or ... "fife7 with ... l:td8. White's first goal is to hang on to his d5- pawn, of course, which he can sometimes do by a combination of attack on the e4-pawn and the sort of quick development on the queenside that we just referred to. Sometimes he can trade the pawn for positional gains. In our main game, he takes a different approach. 9 iLe2 (D) 9 ttJd2 has been the choice in the majority of games. Without going over the extensive theory, it seems as though Black is holding his own. Mikhalchishin-Kasparov, USSR Ch, Moscow 1981 was an early game that brought 4 ... e5 to general attention: 9 ... "fife7 10 iLe2 l:!.d8 11 a3 ttJxd5 (today, 11...a5 12 "fifc2 iLf5 13 O-O ttJbd7 is a more conventional approach, with compen- sation for the pawn) 12 ttJxd5!? .l:!.xd5 13 "fifc2 iLf5 14 b4 iLb6 15 iLb2 ttJc6 16 O-O ~g5! 17 'it>h 1 (Kasparov assesses 17 ttJc4 iLg4 18 iLxg4 ~xg4 as equal), and although 17 ... .l:td6?! 18 ttJxe4! iLxe4 19 'iVxe4l:td2 could have been an- swered by 20 iLa6! with the better game, Black can improve by Kasparov's 17 ... .l:tc8!, which should equalize. He gives 18 l:!.ac1 :dd8, but we know that this is pre-computer era analysis, since 18 ... ttJxb4! 19 'iVxc8+ iLxc8 20 ':xc8+ iLd8 gives Black a much superior game.

This apparently weakening advance is typical of what White is doing today in many openings.
11 g4 can be defended on multiple grounds:
a) it threatens to play an early g5, driving Black's knight away from the e-pawn, which can be attacked by ttJd2 and'iVc2; b) White directly prevents the standard move ... iLf5; c) White's king wasn't likely to castle any- way, for the reasons given in the note to 8 ... e4. 11 ... h6 (D) This doesn't work out well, but 11...l:td8 12 g5 ttJe8 13 ttJd2 iLf5 14 ttJb3 or 14 i.g4 gives White some advantage. 12 ttJd2!?

Black aims for a hedgehog pawn-structure, as described in Chapter 10, but stops White from playing g3 and makes e4 more difficult for White to accomplish. 5 lDc3 .ltb7 6 f3 White wants to enforce e4 and establish a Maroczy Bind structure. Since the moves g3 and e4 aren't immediately playable, the most interesting alternative is 6 .ltg5, which is now infrequently seen in master practice. For one thing, .ltxf6 isn't much to be feared so that, for example, 6 ... d6 7 .ltxf6 gxf6 gives Black the two bishops and open g-file. Even 6 ... e6 7lDdb5 d6100ks all right, because 8 'iVa4 .ltc6 9 'iVc2 a6 10 lDd4 i..b7 results in an acceptable type of hedgehog position. 6 ••• e6 Notice how White wins the centre following 6 ... d5 7 cxd5 lDxd5 8 lDxd5 "iUxd5 9 e4. Then the possibilities of .ltb5+ and 'iVa4+ create dif- ficulties for Black.

Because of the de- lay in ... liJbd7, White can play 10 'iJla4+ (D).
B
Now 1O ... 'lilVd7 looks innocent enough but White doesn't need to play 11 'iJlxd7+, which has been automatic. In fact, I don't see a truly ad- equate answer to llliJb3! i.d8 (forced, to save the b-pawn) 12 .l:i.dlliJc6 13 'iJla3! i.c7 14 cS!. And if Black plays 1O ... liJbd7, White at least temporarily wins the bishop-pair by 11 liJc6 i.xc6 12 ~xc6, when Black's best move is 12 ... O-O!, in order to cut off the white queen's es- cape-squares with ... liJcS. Still, White can annoy Black with 13 !tdlliJcS (what else?) 14 i.xcs bxcS IS eS ~e8! 16 'lilVxe8 liJxe8 17 f4!, and while Black is far from lost, the pawn-structure is not friendly to his dark-squared bishop. Perhaps with that in mind, Black has an- swered 10 ~a4+ by 1O ... liJfd7!? 11 0-00-0 in a couple of games. Then, because of Black's ret- rograde development, White has the unusual possibility of gaining space by 12 f4!?; for ex- ample, 12 ... 'iJlc7 13 fS liJcs 14 'ilVc2 liJc6 IS liJxc6 'iJlxc6 (1S ... i.xc6? 16 b4 liJd7 17 fxe6 fxe6 18 i.g4) 16 i.f3 with some advantage. You can understand that Black might prefer not to be forced into the lines just examined. He may want to look into earlier move-orders (9 ... 'lilVc7! ?), hoping to circumvent this issue. 11 ~d2 a) Now if White plays 11 a4, ll...liJc6 stops 12 as; that is why Black waited on ... liJbd7. Nevertheless, since the e4-pawn isn't directly attacked in that case, White should consider 12 f4! with the idea 12 ... liJxd4?! (12 ... ~c7 13 ~c1 liJxd4 14 'iJlxd41eaves White with more space) 13 'iJlxd4liJd7 14 ~adl, intending eS. b) You could argue that the move 11 ~hl will be necessary in most lines of this variation anyway, so playing it now has a certain logic.

Many games have arrived at this traditional main line. Black's next is a popular option, al- though he hasn't done badly with the older 16 ... .1f8. 16 ... .1dS!? Black wants to play ... .1c7 and aim at White's king. We saw this precise idea in the Taimanov Sicilian in Volume 1. 17 tbb3 tbe5!? This looks like an obvious move, but it does sacrifice a pawn. The immediate 17 ... .1c7 can be met by 18 .1f4 tbe5 19 .1g3, when White's bishop protects the kingside against ... d5. IS WIIxd6?! (D) Objectively, White is better off going for the vulnerable b-pawn by 18 tba4 d5! 19 exd5 exd5 20 c5, and a fairly random line is 20 ... tbc4 21 .1xc4 dxc4 22 .1f4 WIIa7 23 cxb6 .1xb6+ 24 tbbc5! with the better chances for White.

I should emphasize that the lines in the notes to White's moves 10 and 11 could provide a disincentive to 4 ... b6 as a whole.
9 Asymmetrical Variations
In a number of Symmetrical English variations, Black tries to break the symmetry at an early stage by playing ... dS. After the usual pawn ex- change on dS and recapture with the knight, he wants to control as much central terrain as possi- ble, even to the possible detriment of his devel- opment. These variations are hard to describe with overarching general themes, because they go off on their own at such an early stage. Therefore I'll discuss them individually.

w This move-order might appeal to you as Black, because it opens up many ways to work your way into systems that you might not oth- erwise be able to reach. For example, S g3 l2Jc6 6 .1i.g2 gives you the choice of 6 ... l2Jc7 (a Rubinstein Variation, analysed in this chapter), or 6 ... e6 (a Keres-Parma Variation, also dis- cussed below), or 6 ... g6 7 O-O .1i.g7, which is one of the better forms for Black of the Pure Symmetrical lines with S l2Jf3 l2Jf6 from Chap- ter 7. 5 e4 With this move, first brought to general atten- tion by Nimzowitsch, White's advance cedes d4 to his opponent along the lines of modem Si- cilian Defences such as the Najdorf and Svesh- nikov. The important alternative S d4 (D) can lead in a variety of transpositional and independent directions:
B
a) S ... e6 6 e4 (6 g3l2Jc6 is the Keres-Parma Variation below) 6 ... l2Jxc3 7 bxc3 arrives at a Queen's Gambit, Serni-Tarrasch Variation. This is generally considered somewhat favourable for White due to his big centre, yet it is defi- nitely playable and Black might want to con- sider its use for practical play. b) S ... cxd4 6 'iVxd4 is well-known at the master level. Play usually continues 6 .. .lLlxc3 (6 ... e6 7 e4 and now 7 ... l2Jc6 8 .1i.bS l2Jxc3 9 'iUxc3 transposes to 6 ... l2Jxc3 7 'ilVxc3l2Jc6 8 e4 e6 9 .1i.bS, and thus emphasizes the importance of the move 9 .1i.bS in our main line; also possi- ble is 7 ... l2Jxc3 8 'ilVxc3 .1i.d7, to forestall.1i.bS; then Polugaevsky-Keres, Tallinn 1973 went 9 .1i.e2 l2Ja6!? 10 O-O nc8 11 'iVb3 l2Jcs 12 'ilVe3 .1i.e7 13l2JeS 0-014 b3 'ilVb6 lSl2Jc4 and White stood somewhat better) 7 'ilVxc3 (D).

most effective move, establishing a central pres- ence; others are relatively passive, but perhaps 8 i.g5!? is worth a look) 8 ... e6 (now Black threatens 9 ... i.b4) 9 i.b5 (9 a3 and 9 i.d2 are also played) 9 ... i.d7 10 O-O ~6 11 a4 ~c5 12 'iVd3 ~d6 13 ~e2!. In most games from this position, White has established some advan- tage. One basic idea is to capture more space by e5, setting up a standard position in which White can play i.f4 and l:tac1, of course, but also put pressure on a castled king via i.d3, 'ilVe4, h4 and the like. c) 5 ... tiJxc3 6 bxc3 g6 invites the Exchange Griinfeld main lines, which would arise after 7 e4. White can also play 7 i.g5 i.g7 8 ~d2. However, his most popular alternative to the Griinfeld Defence has been 7 e3. A famous ex- ample went 7 ... i.g7 8 i.d3 (8 i.b5+ is the most common alternative, while 8 i.c4 and 8 i.e2 are also played upon occasion; these are techni- cal lines that I won't go into) 8 ... 0-09 O-O ~c7 10 l:rbl b6 (as you might expect, there are plenty of alternatives on all of these moves, such as 1O ... l:rd8 and 1O ... tiJd7) 11 ~e2l:td8 12 i.e4 and now: cl) 12 ... i.a6 (this move has generally been praised in spite of leading to an inferior posi- tion) 13 c4 tiJc6 14 d5 f5 15 i.d3 e5! 16 e4! tiJd4 17 tiJxd4 cxd4 18 i.g5 l:rf8 19l:!.fc1 .l:tac8 20 i.d2 l:rf7 21 a4 and White launched a pro- ductive queenside attack in Karpov-Kasparov, World Ch match (game 23), Seville 1987. c2) Black might try to improve by 12 ... i.b7 13 i.xb7 'ilVxb7 14 dxc5, and now, instead of 14 ... .txc3 15 ~c2 i.g7 16 i.b2 with an edge for White, play 14 ... 'ilVc7!? 15 cxb6!? axb6, with the kind of Griinfeld pawn sacrifice that we have seen before. Then he has two open files facing isolated pawns, and excellent spots for his knight such as c5, a4 and c4. Similarly complex is 14 ... tiJd7 15 i.a3! ~c7 16 cxb6 tiJxb6. Let's return to 5 e4 and look at some practi- cal examples. The Knight Tour S. .. ltJb4 Lalic - Klasan Zagreb 2007

e4 tiJb4!? (D) The alternative 5 ... tiJxc3 is featured in the next section. w Black's ambitious knight move concedes to White a considerable lead in high-quality piece development, but in return he gets positional compensation. Specifically, Black's knights can land on the enemy weaknesses at d4 and d3, and can be readily supported by queen and rooks on the d-file. The 5 e4 tiJb4 variation is initially a battle of positional ideas in their starkest form, but in the end the contest will usually tum dynamic and depend upon details as each player tries to impose his will on the po- sition. 6i.c4 The most interesting move. White goes for classic development. At the same time, he agrees to give up the castling privilege in order to fight for every central square. For 6 i.b5+, see the next game.

This has taken over as Black's main move. The fianchetto has an unquestionable positional basis, in that 1O ... .i.g7 will reinforce the d4- square.

Then 11 .i.b2 e6 12 ttJxd4 ttJxd4 13 ~g4!?, preventing ... .i.xcs or here simply 13 ttJa4 with the idea h4-hS gives White some advantage. Of course, the capture on b4 is also critical. Over the years White has done very well in both theory and practice following 9 ... cxb4 10 ttJe2 (D) (10 ttJdS was the original idea; it remains unclear).

Rather than describe the nuances of move- order, I'll show a couple of the many examples that have accumulated: a) 1O ... ttJcS (this is the knight's seventh move out of the ten that Black has made, and soon it will have to move again! The idea is to attack e4, lure White's queen to the c-file and then attack it; maybe this is going too far, al- though it has been played by at least two grand- masters) 11 ~c2 e6 (1l...ttJc6 12 d4 ttJd7 13 .i.f4 takes charge of the centre) 12 d4 ttJcd7 (this is not a tremendous square for the knight; another move is 12 ... ttJca6, but White's pres- sure grows following 13 .i.b2 or 13 .i.gS .i.e7 14 h4) 13 .i.gS! .i.e7 (13 .. .f6 is met by 14 .i.xe6! fxgS?!

From the time that 9 b4 hit the scene, the h- pawn advance has been part-and-parcel of White's strategy. It wins space, prepares a rook- lift from hI, discourages ... g6 due tohS, and po- tentially attacks Black's kingside; for example, 12 ... ttJd7 13 hS (Kasparov demonstrated a fur- ther role for 12 h4: 13 .ligS! iL.e7 14:tel ttJb6 IS .lid3 f6 16 .lif4 ttJa6 17 hS with a powerful attack looming, Kasparov-R.Griinberg, Ham- burg (simul) 1985) 13 ... h6 14 .lif4 (or 14 .lib2 with command of the game) 14 ... ttJb6 IS .lid3 .lid7 16 ttJeS!? .lia4 17 ~d2 .lie7 1811h3 ttJbS 19 .l:.g3! ttJxd4 (l9 ...

A strange-looking option, untried as far as I know, would be 11 .lidS!? ttJc6 12l1bl. 1l• .• .i.xe6 12 d4 .lic4+ Many of the ideas are similar after 12 ... ttJc6 13 .lie3 (D).

square on c2 (the same one used in many queenless middlegames), and Black has issues with his own c-pawn, in that protecting it (af- ter i.e3) requires some loosening of the posi- tion, and its presence restricts his dark-squared bishop. To be clear, if Black is well-prepared and ready to defend a somewhat worse posi- tion, he should achieve a draw; however, the lack of winning chances and passive posture will not appeal to most players below the very highest levels. Fortunately for us, the resulting positions are highly instructive. 7 ../iJc6 a) Griinfeld players (presumably the clear majority of those who play S. .. ltJxc3) may want to play 7 ... g6, a position which has occurred fairly often at the top levels, in part because it can also arise when Black plays an early ... g6 and then transposes to this position. The good side of ... g6 is that by not touching his e-pawn, Black doesn't create a weakness on d6, nor block off his queen's bishop. The bad news is that it takes two moves to get the bishop to g7, and in that position its scope is limited by White's pawn on c3. The most natural continu- ation is 8 i.e3 b6. White has two extra pieces out and Black's queenside is very slightly weak- ened. The famous game Anders son-Tempone, Buenos Aires 1979 went 9 a4 ltJc6 10 i.bS i.d7 11 ~c2 i.g7 12l:thdl a6 13 i.c4 i.g4 14 h3! i.xf3 IS gxf3 (White's bishop-pair will be very powerful in the open board, and his dou- bled pawns don't prevent him from expanding in the centre) IS ...

Then 8 'It>c2 is White's most flexible move; he doesn't fear ... i.xf3 because his bishops will have free rein thereafter; for example, 8 ... ltJd7 (8 ... ltJc6 9 .i.e3 e6 10 i.bS creates the usual problems for Black: his f8-bishop has no scope and d6 is weak) 9 i.f4 (Carsten Hansen's suggestion) 9 ... .i.xf3!? 10 gxf3 eS 11 i.e3. White has a nice position, especially with his control of dS. 8 'It>c2 The king takes up safe residence and pro- tects the weak point d3 against any future incur- sions. White can also play 8 .i.f4, for which you should compare what follows, or 8 i.e3. In the latter case, 8 ... e6 is solid, even if it creates that situation mentioned above with Black's bish- ops restricted by their own pawns. In Cvet- kovic-Palatnik, USSR-Yugoslavia, Krk 1976, White played modestly: 9 'It>c2 i.d7 10 i.e2 .i.e7 11 l:thdl O-O-O 12 J::!.d2!? (12 a4! intending as is a more typical plan) 12 ... f6 l3lIadlltJaS 14 eS!? At this point, Black hasn't any special worries if he plays 14 ... i.c6.
8. .. e6 9 i.f4!
Compare this with the previous note. White didn't have to provoke ... e6 by i.e3, and so he can put the bishop on its more active square straightaway. 9 ... f6 (D) 10 ltJd2! Now White intends to combine moves like a4, i.bS and ltJc4, while a background theme is ltJc4-d6+.

l:thd1 ~hd8 (D) w Depending upon your experience and tastes, you may consider this position fairly harmless or a real bother for Black. In either case it's good to get used to the basic ideas because such end- games are not uncommon (the central pawn- structure can arise from several openings). White's advantages of good-versus-bad bishop and the d5 outpost are fine, but neither de- scribes a winning plan. For his part, Black has little to do, since White covers all the d-file squares to which Black could infiltrate, or upon which Black could put a piece. This gives White some time to work with. 17 .l:txd8 .l:[xd818 g4!

White has achieved the basic bind that he had in mind when playing 10 dxc5. He has greater space, a powerful bishop, a beautiful square on e4 for a knight (and queen), and an outpost on d6.

tDc7 (D) Incidentally, 5 ... e6?! is considered an error because of 6 tDxd5 exd5 7 iVb3 and a pawn falls. This was confirmed in Gelfand-Kramnik, FIDE Candidates match (game 8), Sanghi Nagar 1994: 7 ... tDc6 (7 ... i.e6 8 ~xb7 tDd7 doesn't threaten anything) 8 ~xd5 ~xd5 9 i.xd5 tDb4 10 i.e4 f5 11 i.bl and Black had insufficient compensation. The approach with ... tDc7 is called the Rubin- stein System. Black's idea now is to play ... e5 and set up a sort of Maroczy Bind Sicilian in re- verse - more about which in a moment. The main positions of the Rubinstein very often arise after White has played tDf3 on an early move; for example, 2 tDf3 tDf6 3 tDc3 d5 4 cxd5 tDxd5 5 g3 tDc6 6 i.g2 tDc7. With any such move-order, Black needn't deal with various early options that White has in the next few moves below. However, you may note that this sequence allows 5 e4, as analysed above. Finally, I should say that Black can combine the move ... tDc7 with ... g6 and ... i.g7, which is much rarer and a bit suspect. I won't be cover- ing that. The Rubinstein Variation is a long-estab- lished and respected line. When you notice that in so many games Black will get the better position versus just slightly inaccurate or pas- sive play, you begin to understand why leading players have traditionally had so much respect for the Sicilian Maroczy Bind, which is the same opening with an extra tempo: 1 e4 c5 2 tDf3 tDc6 3 d4 cxd4 4 tDxd4 g6 5 c4. Indeed, it's worth taking a look at this Sicilian line with 5 ... i.g7 6 tDc2 tDf6 7 tDc3, when we have a reversed version of the main line of the Rubinstein that comes from 5 ... tDc7 6 tDf3 tDc6 7 O-O e5; White's extra move in the Rubinstein is O-O. As we know, the study of re- versed positions often shows that things are not so simple, in that an extra move can impart information to the opponent. Nevertheless, the basic Maroczy structure should not be under- estimated. After 5 ... tDc7, White's main move is 6 tDf3. In the next game, we'll see the important 6 ~b3. Before turning to those, however, let's look at the slightly controversial forcing move 6 ~a4+ (D). This is important to know about, because it either forces Black into a passive position or wins a pawn: 6 ... i.d7 (6 ... tDd7 7 tDf3 followed by d4 is good for White; 6 ... iVd7 is playable but slightly depressing after simply 7 ~xd7+ tDxd7

By an attack on the b7-pawn, White compels Black's response. 6 ••• ttJc6 7 ii.xc6+ bxc6 (D) w The structure has stabilized and we have the familiar sight of doubled c-pawns on an open file, as in several English Opening lines and in the archetypal Nimzo-Indian Defence. In com- mon with those cases, Black has the bishop- pair and will soon gain space via ... eS to com- pensate for his weaknesses. He can also operate down an open d-file and manoeuvre a knight to d4. On the other hand, by contrast with the Nimzo-Indian, his doubled, isolated c-pawns already stand on an open file and are therefore easily attacked. The dynamics of this trade-off are remarkable, and I'll address the fundamen- tal positional factors again over the next few moves. As an aside, I should say that the sequence 1 c4 cS 2 ttJc3 ttJc6 3 ttJf3 g6 4 d4?!

S'iYa4 This is the more forcing move-order, assum- ing that you want to play 'iVa4 at all, because it bypasses some irregular but dangerous gambits which can occur if you tarry on b3. It's also possible to keep the queen on b3 in order to save a move and perhaps influence central op- erations. An interesting example went 8 ttJf3 f6 (the conventional idea, preparing ... eS) 9 d3 eS

ASYMMETRICAL VARIATIONS 291
important than indicated by the scant attention that it has received. A plausible follow-up is 12 ... i..d6 (Black saves the bishop that protects W the c-pawn) 13 0-00-0 (D). w In this complex position, White has control of the long diagonal, two excellent posts for his knight, and a vulnerable enemy c-pawn to at- tack. His first move might be 14 i..d2, with the idea liJe3-c4 and l:tel, or perhaps 14 b3 intend- ing i..b2 and e3. Black has more space and pro- spective attacks on both wings. He can play for .. JS-f4 with a knight on d4, and include an at- tack by ... ~e8-hS; whether that's realistic is an- other matter. All this should be looked at more closely; it may well be a productive way for White to im- prove upon the main lines, or at least try some- thing different. Apart from 7 O-O and 7 d3, White has these moves worth noting: a) 7 a3, preparing b4, is a standard anti- Maroczy Bind strategy. As it turns out, this plan is fairly useless after 7 ... g6!, since 8 b4?! i..g7! 9 bxcS liJe6 10 i..b2 liJxcs (with the idea ... i..e6) is effective; for example, 11 liJa4 i..xb2 12 liJxb2 i..e6 13 0-00-0 14 l:tel WiaS and Black stands somewhat better because of his supe- rior pawn-structure, Andersson-Portisch, Biel Interzonal 1976. b) The generally accepted solution to 7 Wia4 (threatening liJeS) is 7 ... i..d7 8 Wie4 g6! 9 liJeS i..g7 10 liJxd7 'ir'xd7 11 0-00-0 (D). Black is ready to play ... liJe6-d4. So White's main plan is to expand on the queenside by 12 a3 intending b4; for example, 12 ... l:tac8 13 l:tb1 (Black's main point is shown by 13 b4?! cxb414 axb4 liJbS!) 13 ... liJe6 14 b4 b6!? (or 14 ... cxb4 IS axb4 ~fd8! 16 bS liJaS) IS bS liJcd4 16 e3 liJfS 17 Wia4, Pigusov-Estremera Panos, Las Palmas 1996, and here 17 ... c4! captures the d3-square. Then best play is probably 18 i.c6! 'iVd3 19 1:!b4! liJgS! (with the idea 20 :!.xc4? liJf3+) 20 i.g2 i.xc3 21 dxc3 liJe4 22 i..xe4 ~xe4 23 Wixa7, when, if he feels he must, Black can take the draw with 23 ... liJh4 24 gxh4 ~g4+. 7 ... e5 (D) w 8d3 White has various alternatives which the reader may wish to investigate; for example: a) One significant variation, which also can be introduced on moves 6 and 7, begins with 8 b3. After i..b2, White wants to play ltel and ei- ther liJe4 or liJa4, attacking both cS and eS; he may also play liJe1-d3. a1) A respected solution is 8 ... i.g4 9 i..b2 ~d7; for example, 10 ltel f6 (or 1O ... liJe6) 11 liJe4 liJa6. Black's knight goes to a6 fairly often in the Rubinstein, usually in order to protect the
292 MASTERING THE CHESS OPENINGS
cS-pawn. He might choose that square for it, in- stead of e6, so as to deter the move b4, or sim- ply because a knight on a6 stays out of the way of other pieces. This is a complex position with mutual chances. One possibility is 12 tbel (heading for d3) 12 ... Ji.e7 13 f3 (not 13 tbd3? ~xd3) 13 ... Ji.hS 14 tbd3 Ii.d8, and the game is roughly level.

Until you've studied this variation for some time (preferably in conjunction with the re- versed set-up in the Maroczy Bind Sicilian), you may wonder how White can possibly ne- glect his development in a position where he has already given up space and the centre. In fact, he will even move the knight a third time next move (to c4)! The first part of White's jus- tification is the easiest: he threatens 10 Ji.xc6+, after which his knight will be perfectly placed
ASYMMETRICAL VARIATIONS 293
on c4, and Black's pawns will be too weak. Thus Black must defend with a passive move. 9 .•. i.d7 10 ttJc4 Now White gains another tempo with the threat of 11 i.xc6 and 12 ttJxe5. 10 ... f6 Black protects the e-pawn, albeit at the seem- ingly modest cost of loosening the light squares along the a2-g8 diagonal. With 1O ... f6, Black has agreed to contest the most popular line of the Rubinstein Variation, from which the top grandmasters have begun countless battles. I'm going to provide very selective analysis about the ingenious pawn sacrifice 1O ... O-O!? 11 i.xc6 i.xc6 12 ttJxe5 i.e8 (D), although it may deserve more. White has won a centre pawn and has no weaknesses! What is Black up to? It turns out that this position has its own idiosyncratic char- acter. He has two bishops, to be sure, but these are only truly effective in combination with the position of White's knight, which has no good retreat-square when attacked; for example, on c4 it can be pushed back by ... b5, and on f3, the al- ready dangerous move ... i.c6 gains in strength. When you add to that the fact that White has weak light squares around his king (with no light-squared bishop) and that his e-pawn can't move without creating a weakness on d3, you can see how Black dares to sacrifice the pawn. From White's point of view, he can take comfort in the fact that he has captured one of the most important pawns on the board. More- over, his remaining bishop is his 'good' one (unobstructed by his centre pawns), and for a move or two, Black's pieces will be passively placed. In the chess of the past few years, Black has been foregoing 10 ... O-O in favour of 1O ... f6; that may be a sort of conservatism, or it may re- flect some difficulties with 10 ... O-O. Here are two lines that might be considered problematic for Black: a) 13 e4 has been underrated, in my opinion. White develops his bishop at the cost of ceding the d4-square: 13 ... i.f6 14 ttJg4 i.d4 15 ttJe3 i.c6 16 ttJf5 ttJe6 (D). w 17 ii.e3!? (17 ttJxd4 ttJxd4 18 i.e3 looks smarter; Schussler-Donaldson, Malmo 1985 went 18 .. .f5 19 ii.xd4 ~xd4 20 ~b3+ 'it'h8 21 ttJe2 ~d7 22 f3 ii.b5 23 ttJf4 with a clear ad- vantage for White) 17 ... g6 18 ttJh6+!? (or 18 ttJh4) 18 ... 'it'h8?! (18 ... 'it'g7 appears better) 19 ~b3! ii.xe3 20 fxe3 'i!Vxd3 21 ttJg4 with the idea of J:1adl, Granda-de la Villa, Leon 1997. White has the upper hand in all lines; the game went 2l...'i!Vd8 22 ttJd5'i!VaS (versus ~c3+) 23 ttJe5! with a definite advantage. b) 13 'i!Vb3 is more abstract than 13 e4, in that the move is an annoyance as much as it is a plan. White peeks at b7, pins the f7-pawn and discourages ... ttJe6 in some lines because he can reply with either ttJd5 or ~d5. He is ready to develop his queen's bishop, and waits to see how his opponent will proceed. In Piket-Kaspa- rov, Internet 2000, Black attacked by 13 ... ii.f6 14 ttJg4 i.d4 (various analysts give 14 ... i.c6 15 ttJxf6+ 'i!Vxf6 16 i.e3 ttJe6 17 ttJe4 ~f5 18 f3 when White, still a pawn up, obviously has the better of it) 15 e3 (Franco says that 15 ~xb7 lIb8 16 ~xa7 is worthy of attention - then Black has serious attacking chances based upon the moves ... c4, ... i.c6 and .. .f5-f4, which is

I would hate to have to assess this posi- tion after, say, 16 ... ttJe6; at any rate, I doubt that White stands worse) 15 ... i.xc3 16 ~xc3 b6 17 f3!? i.b5 (D). w 18 ttJf2?!

Here White is still a pawn up and Black doesn't appear to have enough compensation after 22 I!.fel, since 22 .. .f5 can be answered by 23 f4!. Naturally, these lines remain wide open to improvement.

White seizes his chance to attack the keyeS point. I won't be looking at the preventive 11 a4; according to theory, Black holds the bal- ance.

Out of the many factors to con- W sider, Black's strong central position carries a lot of weight, and should guarantee at least equality. 13a4 White initiates the standard break on the queenside: not only does it prepare the follow- ing intrusion into Black's position, but it also clears c4 for a knight. If White wants to conquer more territory on the kingside and secure the attractive e4-square for his other knight, he can advance his f-pawn. However, by so doing he permanently gives up any challenge to what is after all the bastion of Black's position, the pawn on eS. The game Smejkal-Suetin, Novi Sad 1982 saw Black equalize after 13 fS O-O 14 .Bd2 ttJd4 IS J::tc1 .Be8 (or IS ...

The resulting position is as murky as any- thing else in this line. It appears to me that White's exchange won't mean much with his king potentially exposed and Black having ex- tra pawns. Camacho-Ramos, Match (game 2), Cuba 2003 continued 18 Whl ~xc8 19 .tf4 LtJd4 20 ttJd6 ~a6 21 LtJbS?!

The sequence of exchanges has resulted in a typical imbalance. White has the better outpost

w 19 f5?! This radical decision prevents Black from playing ... fS or putting a piece on that square; it also introduces the notion of a kingside attack by a rook-lift and 'iUf1-h3. The flip side is that White's knight is tied to defence of the pawn on fS. Black also gains eS for a bishop and, impor- tantly, a tempo for his central attack.

10 The Hedgehog Variation
This chapter deals with a system sporting the odd name 'Hedgehog'. For those of you won- dering, the hedgehog is an animal covered by needle-like spines. In order to defend itself, the hedgehog curls into a ball, so that when an en- emy comes too close, it gets pricked by the spines. In chess, a similar concept is expressed by a position in which a player has little space to work with, but which is difficult for an oppo- nent to breach without encountering a sudden and sharp counterattack. Although the word 'hedgehog' had been floating around for years to describe various structures characterized by only second- and third-rank pawns, the name 'Hedgehog Variation' first came into widespread use (in several languages!) to describe specifi- cally the English Opening variation after 1 c4 c5 2 ttJf3 ttJf6 3 ttJc3 e64 g3 b6 5 iog2 i.b7 6 O-O i.e7 (or 6 ... a6 or 6 ... d6), usually with 7 d4 cxd4 8 'iVxd4 or 7 l:i.el followed by e4 and d4, with Black putting pawns on d6, b6 and a6. The diagram shows one of the main positions stem- ming from this move-order. w I use the name Hedgehog with a capital 'H' to refer to this English Opening variation, and the adjective hedgehog with a small 'h' to refer to black pawn-structures involving ... a6, ... b6, ... d6 and ... e6 that crop up in several other open- ings. In most hedgehog variations that we care about, Black's c-pawn has been exchanged, or is about to be. White's pawns can be on c4 and/or e4, as we have seen in the English Open- ing. That also occurs in many variations of the Sicilian Defence. In practice, the official Hedge- hog Variation of this chapter differs from oth- ers, in that White's bishop is always situated on g2. In most other English Opening variations and in the Sicilian Defence, it tends to be on e2, d3 or even c2. In Chapter 8, we see such a hedgehog formation in the Anti-Benoni system with 4 ... b6. The Hedgehog has been played a lot on the international circuit and at the grandmaster level of play, but not as much at lower levels. In the past 20 years it has gone from a rather eclec- tic set-up to a highly theoretical one, in the sense that top players engage in lines extending past move 20. Of course, this is hardly a unique situation in modern chess. Not only do grand- masters play lengthy theoretical lines in open- ings such as the Sicilian Najdorf, Botvinnik Semi-Slav, and main-line King's Indian, but we also see 'ordinary' players doing so in tour- naments and on the online playing sites. The difference is that the Hedgehog developed as an opening that primarily involved positional themes and not overtly forcing lines. The clar- ity of those themes has made it one of the most written-about variations in the English Open- ing. If you like positional manoeuvring, and are willing to put some time into learning a few tac- tical lines, the Hedgehog remains a fun and in- structive option from both sides of the board.
1 c4 c5 2 ttJf3
The question is: how does one get to the English Opening Hedgehog Variation? It's im- portant to realize that Black can't always play the Hedgehog, and see in what ways White can aim for or steer clear of it. Here are some major move-order possibilities: a) 2 ttJc3 ttJf6 (after 2 ... b6 3 ttJf3 i.b7, White can play 4 e3! and 5 d4 to claim a pleas- ant game) 3 g3. Now Black's best shot at a
298 MASTERING THE CHESS OPENINGS
Hedgehog Variation is to play 3 ... e6 4 lbf3 (with the idea 4 ... d5 5 cxd5 exd5 6 d4; White doesn't usually want to permit 4 .i.g2 d5) 4 ... b6 5 .i.g2 .i.b7, etc., which is our main line. b) 2 lbc3 lbf6 3 lbf3 b6 (3 ... e6 4 d4 cxd4 5 lbxd4 is a standard position in which Black generally plays 5 ... lbc6, 5 ... .i.b4 or 5 ... a6, none of them leading to positions from this chapter)
4 d4 (4 g3 .i.b7 5 .i.g2 e6 is a Hedgehog Varia-
tion; White can also play 4 e4 .i.b7 5 e5, or here 5 .i.d3 with the idea .i.c2 and d4) 4 ... cxd4 5 lbxd4 .i.b7 (5 ... e6 6 e4) 6 f3 followed by e4 transposes to an Anti-Benoni hedgehog forma- tion from Chapter 8 (beginning with 4 ... b6). This differs greatly from the variation we are discussing in this chapter, because White's bishop will go to e2 instead of g2. 2 ••• lbf6 (D) Once again, Black can play 2 ... b6 3 d4 (3 g3 .i.b74 .i.g2 lbf6 5 lbc3 e6 brings us back to the main line) 3 ... cxd4 4 lbxd4 .i.b7 5 lbc3 lbf6 6 f3 d6 7 e4 e6 and we have transposed to the Anti-Benoni from Chapter 8. w 3 lbc3 This is equivalent to 2 lbc3 lbf6 3 lbf3. Here, too, 3 d4 cxd4 4 lbxd4 prevents the Hedgehog proper. What this means, in conjunction with the last few notes, is that most of the time after I c4, it's White's choice whether to enter into the Hedgehog, and in reality, most players don't choose to do so. But that isn't the whole story. In fact, the popularity of the Hedgehog at the top levels comes primarily from games that begin with 1 lbf3. Then, as you can work out for yourself, the number of ways that Black has of getting to a Hedgehog becomes higher. For example, one common sequence is 1 lbf3 lbf6 2 c4 b6 3 g3 .i.b7 4 .i.g2 e6 5 O-O .i.e7 6 lbc3 c5. If you look at the entire set of lnfonnators, which are domi- nated by grandmaster play and have over 600 true Hedgehog games, you find that, depending upon the subvariation, from 60% to 90% of those games begin with 1 lbf3, often 80% or more. This strange situation goes back to the fact that a significant minority of leading play- ers don't want to play on the white side of 1 c4 e5, although they otherwise like playing the English Opening. So they play 1 lbf3 followed by 2 c4. Whether that is strictly logical or merely understandable depends upon your interpreta- tion of the first section of this book. It's true that a very large number of players answer 1 c4 with 1...e5, so from that point of view White might want to avoid it. If nothing else, bypass- ing 1...e5 cuts down on one's preparation time. On the other hand, playing against 1. .. e5 can be a lot of fun and give the kind of complex game that most players want. Finally, having pointed out that 1 c4 allows Black to dictate matters with 1...e5, I should say that 1 lbf3 also cuts down on your flexibility in crucial ways. To cite one example of many, White has to deal with 1...d5, when an English Opening is no lon- ger on the cards. In that situation we have possi- bilities including the Queen's Gambit and the Reti Opening, the latter to be discussed in the next volume. Having said all that, let's return to the Hedge- hog itself.
3. .. e6
Again, 3 ... b6 can be used by those who don't mind playing against 4 d4 cxd4 5 lZJxd4 or 4 e4. This book won't deal with the Double Fianchetto line that combines ... g6 and ... b6.
4 g3 b6 5 .i.g2 .i.b7 6 O-O (D)
White can accelerate his Hedgehog set-up by 6 d4 cxd4 7 'ii'xd4, but this has the drawback that 7 ... lbc6 is better than similar lines below, because 8 ~f4 .i.b4 develops apace. Then the threat of ... .i.xc3+ and subsequent pressure along the c-file (already well underway) usu- ally leads to 9 .i.d2 O-O 10 O-O, and now the move 1O ... .i.e7! sets up a standard position in which White's bishop is quite misplaced on d2. In fact, it would be better off on c 1; for one thing, variations with ~f4 tend to go well with
THE HEDGEHOG VARIATION 299
b3 and i.b2. Don't worry if you find this con- fusing; as you might guess, it's a practical sum- mary which you might want to investigate by B studying the specifics.

6 ... i.e7 Move-orders can be outrageously difficult to list in the Hedgehog, much less to understand. I'm going to gloss over them to some extent, hopefully not as much as most books do (ironi- cally, the one that goes into excruciating detail about this subject gets it all wrong!). But in the process, I'll try to provide some practical knowl- edge to help you avoid frustration at the board. To begin with, 6 ... i.e7 is easily the most popu- lar move. It develops quickly and keeps open the option of playing an early and effective ... dS (6 ... d6 obviously doesn't do so, and 6 ... a6 tends to be both slow and marginally irrelevant when combined with ... dS). For example, if Black plays 6 ... i.e7, 7 ... dS becomes a reasonable op- tion versus slow moves such as 7 d3 and 7 b3, and is a serious response to the extremely popu- lar 7 Itel. Similarly, 7 Itel can be met by 7 ... liJe4, because ... liJe4 is a move that only fits with early castling, something that 6 ... !Be7 pre- pares. But suppose that Black doesn't want to play ... dS or ... liJe4 in any case? Then other considerations apply: a) A drawback to 6 ... d6 is that lines with 7 b3 (D) can be more difficult in two ways. One is that the simple line with !Bb2, e3, 'iVe2, Itfdl and d4 tends to be more effective, again because Black would have to waste time if he were to play ... dS against it. But Black also has to deal with the specifics; for example, in the line 7 ... liJbd7 8 i.b2 (if White now switches to 8 d4, then after 8 ... cxd4 9 'iVxd4 a6, White's attack on d6 by !Ba3 can be blocked by ... liJcS) 8 ... i.e7 9 d4 cxd4 (9 ... O-O 10 dS! exdS llliJh4! is nice for White, thinking about liJfS; e.g., ll...g6 12 cxdS liJe8 13 f4! !Bxh4 14 gxh4 'iVxh4 IS e4 and Black's dark squares are ex- tremely vulnerable) 10 liJxd4 i.xg2 11 ~xg2
(D).

Here White's knight looks at c6; this is a better version of the bishop exchange than White usually gets. Sorokin-Yudasin, USSR Ch, Moscow 1991 continued 1l...'iVc7 12 e3 a6 (early on in Hedgehog practice, it was deter- mined that endings after 12 ... ~7+ 13 ~f3 were difficult for Black to play, and provided him no positive prospects) 13 f4!? g6 (13 ... O-O 14 'iVf3 challenges Black' s light-square control, and after 14 ... l:.ac8 IS g4! liJcs 16 gSliJfd7 17 .:tadl l:tfe8 18 h4, White had space and better minor pieces in Andersson-A.Sokolov, Bilbao 1987) 14 'iUf3 l:.c8 IS g40-0 16 gS liJhS 17 .:tadl with a small but steady advantage for
300 MASTERING THE CHESS OPENINGS
White. So 6 ... d6 has a few unique problems in- volving b3; a careful examination will reveal other issues. b) 6 ... a6 (D) used to be more popular. w Again, White sometimes plays b3, .tb2, e3 and an early d4, when ... a6 may not be so use- ful. But a more interesting line is 7 d4 (as men- tioned above, 7 l:!.el achieves 8 e4 more easily than after 6 ... .te7, that is, ... a6 would be virtu- ally a tempo-loss in lines where ... dS or ... ttJe4 might be contemplated) 7 ... cxd4 8 'iVxd4 d6 9 b3 (on the positive side, Black's choice of6 ... a6 rather than 6 ... .te7 means that after the popular idea 9 .tgS, 9 ... ttJbd7 prepares for ... ttJxf6 to be the answer to .txf6; compare the games below) 9 ... ttJbd7 (after 9 ... .te7 10 .ta3, Black already has problems with his d-pawn) 10 ttJgS (D).
B
This move pops up again and again, al- though it usually achieves nothing special ver- sus accurate play. In this position, however, the move-order seems to favour White, which may argue against playing ... a6 too early. The game M.Osborne-Cox, Coulsdon 200S contin- ued 1O ... .txg2 11 Rxg2 llc8?! (this idea of . .. .l:tc8-c6, to defend the d-pawn, works well in some positions, but not here; the best option is probably 11....te7; for example, 12 ttJge4 tiJcs 13 .tb2 O-O, but White still has the edge after 14 .lIadl, since 14 ... dS!?

You might wonder why Black wouldn't be thrilled to win an immediate tempo via S".ttJc6
(D).
The basic problem with the move is rather technical. It stems from the fact that in hedge- hog formations, including ones in the Sicilian Defence, this knight has the most influence from a more flexible post on d7; in fact, Black will sometimes move a knight from c6 by means of ".ttJeS-d7, even at the cost of some time. In part this is because Black wants his bishop on b7 to have an unobstructed view; then, for ex- ample, it can attack a white pawn on e4, which can be further bothered by ".ttJcS. This ma- noeuvre ".ttJc6-eS-d7 arises in the Taimanov Sicilian when White plays ttJbS and c4, but in that variation White wastes a lot of time to get one knight to the mediocre a3-square, whereas in our current Hedgehog position, White doesn't commit to e4 until he sees where Black's pieces are going. That said, ".ttJc6 has some easily compre- hensible advantages: it gains a tempo, no small matter, and it contests the d4-square, denying White's minor pieces access to it without the possibility of exchange. Usually White is will- ing to exchange queens following 9 'iVf4 (9 'iVd3 is also played) 9".'iVbS (a standard idea, to contest d6; Black understands that in the static position after 9".d6, the knight will be some- what misplaced on c6, as just described) 10 ttJbS!?

iLb7 6 O-O iLe7 7 d4 cxd4 8 'ilVxd4 d6 (D) w Here's one of the key Hedgehog positions, and the starting point for the great majority of Hedgehog battles until about a decade ago. It is still the main line, followed closely by 7 .l:!.el. I want to show a few classic and modem games with 7 d4 containing the kind of ideas common to the Hedgehog. First, after 8 'ilVxd4 d6 what's going on? For one thing, White has more com- mand of space (all the more so after Black plays ... tiJbd7). He has potential pressure against Black's weak pawn on d6; this can be devel- oped via l:Idl, b3/iLa3, and tiJbS, tiJe4 or tiJg5- e4. White is also weakness-free. His plans are varied and fundamentally different: he can play for space with a 'Maroczy Bind' pair of pawns on c4 and e4, or he can stick to piece-play, with some combination of .l:tdl, iLgS, b3/iLb2, and tiJd4 (along with a variety of other piece de- ployments). For a while, the latter idea discour- aged Black, in the sense that it seemed difficult to scare up counterpJay when White didn't com- mit his e-pawn. Just to make it worse, White has long-term prospects of a kingside pawn ad- vance (f4/fS/g4/gS in some mix) or a queenside advance (a4/aS/b4/CS). The Hedgehog has been championed by nu- merous great players, so naturally Black's posi- tion can't be all that bad. It has, I think, fewer positive aspects than White's position, but more powerful ones. As in the Sicilian Defence (with the same weak d-pawn on an open d-file), Black has that most underrated of all advan- tages: the central pawn-majority. A central ma- jority not only has the potential to expand, but it covers more key squares than a single-pawn centre does. Here, for example, the hedgehog centre controls not only eS and dS, but also cS and fS. This makes it difficult for White to ad- vance in the centre, and even more difficult to plant a piece there. Also, notice Black's minor- ity attack with ... a6 and ... bS. "Wait a minute," you might say, "Why would achieving ... b5 mean anything? White can simply capture on bS and he has even gained the chance to cre- ate a passed pawn immediately with b3 and a4." There are two separate considerations here. First, a passed a-pawn in the opening or middle- game tends to be as much a liability as an asset; it will often become a target before it ever be- comes a threat. But in any event, what does the disappearance of White's c-pawn signify? That Black's central majority has a much better chance of advancing, creating positive oppor- tunities in all stages of the game. Black has other things going for him. Since his centre gives him a certain invulnerability, Black has a lot of time to get his pieces out and use them in both active and reactive ways. For
THE HEDGEHOG VARIATION 303
example, knights on cS and f6 in conjunction with a bishop on b7 exert pressure on e4, and rooks on squares like c8, d8 and e8 can assist in making central defence and offence more ef- fective. Last, but by no means least, experience has shown that Black's particular structure and piece placement have a surprising elasticity. With only three ranks to work with, they have as many or more options as do White's pieces with five ranks to operate on. This is best shown by example. 9b3 As suggested above, White has numerous moves here, such as 9 e4, 9 :dl and 9 ..tgS. In this game he sets up a c4/e4 pawn-structure.
9. .. O-O
Practice has shown that 9 ... ttJbd7?! 10 ttJbS! is very dangerous for Black, the tactical point being 1O ... ttJcS (lO ... dS 11 cxdS ..txdS 12 'iYf4 O-O 13 ..tb2 gives White good play down the d- file and/or c-file) 11l:!.d1 ttJfe4 12 ~xg7!?

10 e4 ttJbd7 (D)
w 11 ~e3 (D) White reorganizes his pieces in order to cen- tralize his knight on d4. The queen isn't doing much good on d4 at this stage, but it will remain in a position from where it can enforce the move eS as a response to dS. For example, 11 ... dS 12 cxdS exdS 13 eS, a sequence which is normally enough to establish a central superiority, and therefore to be remembered (if you're White, you always have to be ready to answer ... dS). Once White plays b3, with or without e4, the move ..ta3 in conjunction with :d1 can be a problem, because Black needs to shore up his vulnerable d6-pawn without making conces- sions. His move-order here with 1O ... ttJbd7 is specifically designed to meet that threat, since 11 ..ta3 ttJcS is very solid. In general, Black would like to answer the move ..ta3 in this way rather than by ... dS, which tends to be too loos- ening, or by a passive move such as ... ttJe8 (af- ter ... O-O).
B
11 ..• a6 12 ttJd4 In the contests with 7 .lIel below, White plays e4 and d4, and when Black plays ... cxd4, White recaptures with the knight. That makes White's variation in this game seem inferior, because here his queen has to make two extra moves, to d4 and then e3 before the knight gets to d4. In addition, it can be argued that White's bishop stands better when centralized on e3 than on b2. That holds true in related openings, such as the Fianchetto Variation of the King's Indian Defence, where White operates with the same pawn-structure. Nevertheless, White might say that the tempo doesn't matter so much as long as Black can't enforce a freeing move; and in the meantime, White has avoided lines such as 7 .l:te1 dS and 7 lIel ttJe4. We'll talk more about these trade- offs in the next games. ... ~c713 ..tb2 lUeS! (D)
304 MASTERING THE CHESS OPENINGS
w Over the years this has become widely ac- cepted as the best square for Black's rook, for a variety of reasons. It increases Black's chance of playing ... d5 successfully, because after any exchange of pawns he will have an open e-file (vis-iI-vis the queen in the precise situation be- fore us). The rook is also well-placed to meet the idea f4-f5, attacking e6. White may even be able to reinforce that attack by .th3 at some point, so having the rook on e8 can be invalu- able. Finally, we already know that Black's pawn-breaks ... b5 and ... d5 are important, but the move ... e5 can be equally or more impor- tant. For example, a simple idea is ... e5, kicking White's knight off d4 and then playing ... b5. Also, in the many positions where White has a pawn on f4, ... e5 can lead to the opening of the e-file by Black's ... exf4, or by Black's recapture with a piece when White plays fxe5. In that case the rook on e8 exerts pressure down the e- file. All of which is not to say that White can't profit from the transaction as well, since he both gains access to d5 and f5, and opens the f- file for his rooks. Incidentally, ... lUe8 is also the most respected rook placement in the Scheveningen Sicilian, another variation with a hedgehog pawn-struc- ture, for many of the same reasons. 14h3!? This is a double-edged move. It stops ... ttJg4, which together with ... d5 and ... .ltc5 can cause trouble for White. However, although it's a rather obscure point at the moment, sometimes when White plays f4, the move h3 turns out to have weakened the g3-square, and by exten- sion, f4 itself. Thus the moves ... h5-h4 and ... ttJh5 are seen in games with this variation, and even ... d5, opening up the queen's view of f4 and g3 from its post on c7, followed by ... .td6. Karpov-Adams, Wijk aan Zee 1998 wasn't different in terms of structure but ended up with a different resolution of the tension: 14 l:!.ac1 l:tad8 15 .l:tfel 'iWb8 16 .l:te2 .tf8 (Black's last three moves have been played in many games: he gets the queen off the c-file, with .. :~a8 a possibility, and he prepares to give the bishop a more active role on g7) 17 h3 (notice that White is still able to answer 17 ... d5 with 18 e5, and Black's other potential break with ... b5 is under control for the moment) 17 ... g618l:!.cel!?(D).

Often in this sort of position the players sim- ply shuffle back and forth for 20 moves or so until something appears (or doesn't).

White plays a straightforward and flexible move that aims at the d6-pawn and coordinates well with an attack by pieces. White retains op- tions of ..Itg5, tbg5, b3 with either ..Itb2 or ..Ita3, and even e4. In general he wants to see which way Black plays next ( ... a6, ... O-O, ... tbbd7 or ... tbc6) before he commits to a formation. 9 ... a610 tbg5 This is one of the 'piece-play' approaches. White's first goal with this move, which is played in several related positions (see the note about 6 ... a6 in the chapter introduction), is to exchange off the light-squared bishops. This may seem odd, because White played 8 'iVxd4 in large part to avoid this exchange. However, because of the particular move-order that both sides have chosen, White wants to win the e4square in or- der to bring a knight there and exploit Black's lightly-protected d6-pawn in some lines. .... .Itxg211 ~xg2 tbc6 a) Timing is very delicate in the Hedgehog; for example, 11 ... l:ta7? is a good idea in general (see the next note), but very badly timed here, due to another combination of White's moves: 12 ..Ite3! tbbd7 (the threat on b6 compels Black to occupy the d7-square that his rook was sup- posed to use; as a result, the d-pawn can't be defended) 13 tbge4 O-O 14 tbxd6 'iVa8+ 15 f3 .l:!.d8 16 tbde4 and White keeps his extra pawn, Wojtkiewicz-Jurek, Bern 1993. b) Another strategy for Black is to fight back with ... d5; for example, 11...O-O 12 tbce4 d5, but White can put pressure on Black's d-pawn by the sharp 13 tbxf6+ ..Itxf6 14 'iVg4!, when 14 ... l:ta7 is met by 15 e4! l:td7 16 exd5 exd5 17 cxd5 .l:txd5?? 18 'iVe4. 12 'ilVf4 (D)

(White wants to break down or at least expose Black's centre pawns by fS, so Black has to re- spond quickly) Is ... lLlc6 16 fSlLleS! 17 'ii'e40-0 18 fxe6 fxe6 19 .l:txf8+ i.xf8 20 lLlf3 (other- wise it's hard to get at Black's position, because the knight on eS is so strong) 20 ... lLlxf3! 21 exf3 J::.c7 (finally!

Black used to play 11 ... i.xf3 12 'ii'xf3 .J:!.a7 more often, with the idea ... .J:!.d7. Then White has a small edge because of his greater com- mand of territory and targets in the enemy camp. Nevertheless, if Black is patient and de- fends accurately, he should come out all right. 12 .:tfdl i.e7 13 lLle4 i.xe4 14 'ii'xe4 .l:ta7 IslLld4 (D)

Black deviates from well-known theory at this point, perhaps more to create new prob- lems than out of dissatisfaction with the estab- lished lines.

Normally 7 ... d6 will transpose after 8 e4 a6 9 d4 cxd4, etc. Black has two conventional ways to avoid the hedgehog structure: a) 7 ... d5 was one ofthe main reasons why 7 .l:tel didn't catch on for so many years. Indeed, the rook move seems to have little role in this position. On the other hand, it can be argued that ... .i.b7 and ... d5 often don't go that well to- gether throughout the Queen's Indian/Bogo- IndianlNimzo-Indian complex, so that White can hope for a pull by playing normal moves. At any rate, here are two high-level recent ex- amples: al) Topalov-Carlsen, MorelialLinares 2007 saw 8 d4!? dxc4 9 dxc5 i.xc5 10 'iVa4+ ttJbd7 11 ~xc4 O-O 12 .l:tdl l:tc8 13 'iVh4 i.e7, and here White found the creative idea 14 'iVh3!

J~.fe8), the h-pawn itself may
312 MASTERING THE CHESS OPENINGS
become a target, and Black's kingside defences are theoretically weakened. 14h3 Black can feel good about having provoked this move because now .Bh3 can't assist in an attack on e6, and White has to defend the h2-b8 diagonal in some lines after ... h4. White can try to avoid these problems by two means: a) 14 ~hl makes room at gl for the bishop if Black persists in ... tbg4. A sample line is 14 ... tbc5 15 .igl h416 b4 (16 g4?! h3 17.Bf3 allows the typical Sicilian-like dark-square grab with 17 ... g5! 18 fxg5!? tbh7 19 b4 tbd7 20 g6 tbg5! 21 gxf7+ ~xf7 and White has too many weaknesses) 16 ... h3! 17 .Bf3 tbcd7 (17 ... .l:.ad8, to answer 18 bxc5 with 18 ... dxc5, is dubious because of 18 ~e2 tbcd7 19 tbd5! exd5 20 cxd5 tbc5 21 bxc5 and White plays Win and Wixh3 next) 18 g4!? with an unclear attack. White has to be wary because the area around his king is loose, but g5 and tbd5 can create de- fensive problems for Black. b) By keeping h3 free for the bishop, White makes 14 f5!? an important candidate, even if it means giving up his dark-squared bishop; for example, 14 ... tbg4 (14 ... e5? 15 tbd5) 15 Wie2!? (15 fxe6 tbxe3 16 .l:txe3 .Bg5) 15 ... tbxe3 16 ~xe3 ~c5 (16 ... tbe5 17 fxe6 tbg4 18 tbd5!) 17 b4! (17 fxe6?? .Bg5 18 ~f2 fxe6) 17 ...

11 Mikenas Attack and
Nimzo-Engl ish
1 c4 ttJf6 (D)
w Black uses 1... ttJf6 if he intends to playa so- called 'Indian System', that is, one with the moves ... g6 or ... e6, in this case omitting or de- laying ... c5 and ... e5. By doing so, he keeps the possibility of a mainstream d4 opening alive. That is, if White plays 2 d4, Black may play 2 ... g6 and transpose into a King's Indian De- fence with 3 ... j.g7 or into a Griinfeld Defence after 3 ... d5. Or he might choose to answer 2 d4 with 2 ... e6 and transpose to one of several open- ings such as a Nimzo-Indian Defence (3 ttJc3 j.b4), or a Queen's Indian Defence (3 ttJf3 b6), or a Queen's Gambit Declined (3 ... d5). In this book I'm concerned with positions that belong to the English Opening proper, that is, not involving transpositions to a 1 d4 open- ing. In particular, White can go his own way versus standard Indian Defence set-ups. After 1 c4 ttJf6 2 ttJc3 g6 3 g3 j.g7 4 j.g2, for example, White may choose to forego d4 by an early e4, or by a combination of ttJf3 and d3. Those op- tions are discussed in Chapter 12. Following the moves 1 c4 ttJf6 2 ttJc3 e6, White can abstain from d4 by playing 3 e4, when Black's natural replies are 3 ... d5 or 3 ... c5. He can also play 3 ttJf3, when Black's most in- dependent move is 3 ... j.b4. Those are the varia- tions under consideration in this chapter. Other lines can arise when Black sets up with ... e6, but I've limited myself to these as the most common and, I think, the most instructive in a broader sense. Before moving on to specific positions, I need to make a few points regarding transpositions into other variations or openings. For example, after 1 c4 ttJf6, both 2 ttJc3 and 2 ttJf3 have their advantages and drawbacks. Both allow 2 ... c5, of course, with a Symmetrical English. 2 ttJc3 gives Black the extra choice of 2 ... e5, transpos- ing to a normal 1 c4 e5 English. But if Black an- swers 2 ttJc3 with 2 ... e6, White can control the direction of the play himself by using 3 e4 (dis- cussed in this chapter), whereas after 3 ttJf3, Black has the choices; for example, 3 ... j.b4, 3 ... c5, or 3 ... d5 (the latter provoking 4 d4 with a Queen's Gambit Declined). If White wants to eliminate that possibility of 2 ... e5, he can play 2 ttJf3; then, however, Black may be more inclined to respond with 2 ... e6 and 3 ... d5, because many players prefer to defend the Queen's Gambit Declined only when White is already committed to the move ttJf3. Finally, I should mention that White's third most natural response to 1...ttJf6 (apart from 2 d4), which is 2 g3. Then 2 ... e5 is possible, transposing to Chapter 4, but the sequence 2 ... e6 and 3 ... d5 will probably lead to a Cata- lan (for example, after 3 ttJf3 d5 4 d4), and the move 2 ... c5 enters a line of the Symmetrical English in which White is committed to g3. You mayor may not be happy with these pos- sibilities; it's mostly a matter of taste. There are more such issues, but I find the above the most meaningful points for the 1 c4 player.
314 MASTERING THE CHESS OPENINGS
Mikenas Attack: Introduction
1 c4 tZ:lf6 2 tZ:lc3 e6 3 e4 (D)
As indicated above, when Black plays 2 ... e6, he shows his willingness to transpose to one of several queen' s pawn openings in the event of 3 d4. For example, 3 ... d5 is a Queen's Gambit Declined, 3 ... ~b4 is a Nimzo-Indian Defence, and 3 ... cS often turns into a Benoni after 4 dS. The only effective way that White can guar- antee that the game continues in English Open- ing channels is 3 e4, an aggressive move called the Mikenas Attack.
B
Thus we can appreciate the appeal of 3 e4 in a purely practical sense: White makes the ini- tial choice as to the course of the game, and in so doing he limits the theory he needs to mas- ter. In addition, White usually gets to play the aggressor in what are inherently double-edged positions. Right away, he has a threat of 4 eS followed by S d4, and it turns out that Black's reasonable defences all admit of exciting play.
3 e4 also comes with disadvantages, of course,
which become evident as we focus on Black's counter-strategies. Central Challenge with 3 ... d5 3 ... d5 Ivanchuk - P.H. Nielsen Skanderborg 2003 Black directly challenges the centre in classi- cal fashion. Let's walk through the early moves of this line and discuss the reasoning behind them. First, why doesn't Black choose moves other than 3 ... dS and 3 ... cS (analysed in the next sec- tion)? Here are two others: a) 3 ... ~b4? lets White play 4 eS, which is obviously advantageous after the more-or-Iess forced reply 4 ... tZ:lg8; for example, S 'iWg4 (or S d4, or S tZ:lf3) S. .. 'it>f8 (after S. .. g6 6 tZ:lf3, Black has major problems on the dark squares) 6 tZ:lf3 tZ:lc67 d4. Black can't even castle. b) 3 ... eS!? 4 tZ:lf3 tZ:lc6 (D) (3 ... tZ:lc6 4 tZ:lf3 eS transposes). w A funny situation, in which Black wastes a move with ... e6-eS, but contends that c4 is not a desirable move for White in this position. Remarkably, he is willing to enter into the Nimzowitsch Four Knights line (I c4 eS 2 tZ:lc3 tZ:lf6 3 tZ:lf3 tZ:lc6 4 e4) with an extra tempo for White. White has several possible answers: bl) S d4 exd4 6 tZ:lxd4 ~b4 has done accept- ably for Black in several games, even though it may objectively favour White somewhat. b2) After S ~e2!?, S ... ~cS?! 6 tZ:lxeS! is strong, so S ... ~b4 6 d3 d6 7 O-O O-O 8 tZ:ldS might follow. This option could be slightly an- noying to Black. b3) S a3!? is a good choice, preventing ... ~b4 and anticipating S ... ~cS?! (S ... d6 is prob- ably best, when White grabs some central terri- tory with 6 d4) 6 tZ:lxeS! tZ:lxeS 7 d4; here Black would normally play ... ~b4, but White's extra move a3 stops him from doing that. We now return to 3 ... dS (D):
MIKENAS ArrACK AND NIMZO-ENGLISH 315
w 4 e5 White has to respond to the threats of ... dxe4 and ... d4. a) As a rule, he doesn't want to free Black's c8-bishop without gaining some compensating advantage, so 4 exd5 exd5 isn't seen that much. In fact, 5 d4 transposes into a rarely-played French Defence position, i.e., 1 e4 e6 2 d4 d5 3 exd5 exd5 4 c4 ttJf6 5 ttJc3, in which Black has few difficulties. White can also head for unique positions via 5 cxd5 ttJxd5. Then 6 d4 .1i.M! is attractive because White has to take an extra move to defend c3. Instead, 6 ttJf3 is a possible way to escape theory; we're getting rather far afield, but an intriguing continuation would be 6 ... ttJb4 (6 ... ttJc6 7 .1i.b5) 7 d4 .1i.f5 8 .1i.b5+ c6 9 i.a4 ttJd3+ 10 ~f1. b) 4 cxd5 exd5 5 e5 is quite rare these days, although it provides White some new ideas and isn't yet completely worked out. The main line is 5 ... ttJe4! 6 ttJf3 (White shouldn't accept the pawn sacrifice: 6 ttJxe4 dxe4 7 'iVa4+ ttJc6 8 ~xe4 'ilkd4! 9 ~xd4 ttJxd4 10 ~dl .1i.f5 11 d3 O-O-O with a substantial advantage for Black) 6 ... ttJc67 i.b5 .1i.e7 8 'ilka4 (8 .1i.xc6+!? bxc6 9 'ilka4 wins a pawn, although 9 .. :iVd7! 10 ttJxe4 dxe4 11 'ilkxe40-0 12 d4 .1i.a6 gives Black good compensation) 8 ... .1i.d7 9 ttJxe4 a6! 10 ttJf6+?!

(D) has been the most popular choice at the top levels for at least IS years (we'll see 7 ... c5 in the next game). w Black reasons that any time he can establish a central presence and simultaneously open a diagonal for his queen's bishop, he should do so. Now 8 liJf3 transposes to our main game. Instead, 8 ~e2?! wins a pawn, but 8 ... 1i.e7! 9 ~xeS (9 dxe5 'ii'c6 gives Black at least enough for a pawn; White has the weak c-pawns and will have to untangle his pieces to get castled) 9 .. :iVxe5+ 10 dxe5 liJc6 11 f4 f6! opens the position to White's great detriment. Notice White's bishops, blocked by their own pawns; and once the centre is demolished, he will have horrible internal weaknesses on e3 and d3. Although I won't go into detail, I should also say that 7 d4 has a special advantage over 7 liJf3, in that it allows White to answer 7 ... b6 with 8 1i.e2 1i.b7 9 1i.f3, which is probably somewhat favourable for him. Of course, 8liJf3 is also possible, transposing to the next note. 7 ... eS A reasonable alternative is 7 ... b6!? 8 d41i.b7, when 9 1i.e2 1i.d6 10 O-O O-O gives Black fair prospects. White can play more ambitiously by 91i.d3!? (D).

Here's a trick that you may have seen in other openings: 9 ... 1i.d6? 10 1i.g5! 1i.xf3 11 ~d2!, trapping Black's queen! Then 1l...1l.f4! 121i.xf4 threatens 1i.g5 again, so 12 ... 1i.xg2 13 l:!gl1i.b7 is practically forced, when 14l:tg3 re- news the threat with 1i.e5. This trap reappears below. So the main line is 9 ... 1i.xf3 10 gxf3, when White has two sets of doubled pawns and a total of four isolated pawns, but he also has two bishops and a potential attack on Black's light squares, beginning with the move 1i.e4. We now return to 7 ... e5 (D): 8d4 For some time, 8 1i.d3 was popular, with the idea O-O, 1i.e4/c2 and d4. Since solutions have been found, I'll skip over this option, except to show one fun game that is typical of the Mike- nas, in that White gets the bishop-pair and an attack, while at the same time he takes on

Others: a) 8 .. .f6 (to clear out f7 for a knight and guard d6) at best transposes to the main line fol- lowing 9 iLe3 (a unique possibility is 9 f4 ttJf7 10 fS! with the idea 1O ... a6 11 'iVa4) 9 ... a6 10 ttJd6+ ii.xd6 11 ~xd6. b) 8 ... d6? would be ideal, but runs into the typical dark-square take-over 9 cS!.

For the cost of a mere pawn, he has control of the dark squares, Black's pieces are stuck on the first rank, and d6 and b6 are ideal spots upon which to place pieces. In addition, he's gaining more time by attacking the knight on eS.

Black hasn't captured just any pawn, how- ever. It's a centre pawn, and we know how strong a central majority can be in defence, be- cause centre pawns potentially defend the most important attacking squares. Black's first task is to expel the queen. 10 ... f6 Preparing ..,ti:Jf7. 1O ... lbg6 11 JiLe3 Wile7 12 lbe4! illustrates the kind of dark-square exploi- tation that White is aiming for: 12 .. .tZ'lf6 13 ~xe7+ ~xe7 14 JiLc5+ ~d8 15 lbd6 .l:tf8 16 JiLb6+ ~e7 17 O-O-O, and Black is horribly cramped.

w When played against 1 d4, 2 c4 and 3 liJc3, the combination of moves 1...liJf6, 2 ... e6 and 3 ... .tb4 is called the Nimzo-Indian. Hence,
MIKENAS ATTACK AND NIMZO-ENGLISH 325
when played against the English Opening, it may be called the Nimzo-English (well, that was my excuse for inventing the name some decades ago). A fundamental difference be- tween the two is that in our line, Black cannot freely occupy e4 without taking White's move d3 into account. Beyond that, Black isn't so much trying to pin the knight, but either to ex- change it or threaten to exchange it. Why would he want to? Because 3 ... .i.b4 allows him to get his pieces out and castle rapidly, while ex- changing on c3 rids White of a valuable piece that is fighting for the crucial dS- and e4- squares. Furthermore, if White doesn't play ei- ther Wic2 or Wib3, the exchange ... .i.xc3 dou- bles his pawns, which can greatly affect their mobility. In fact, Black will seldom exchange without being forced to do so, so White must normally spend a tempo if he wants to compel that exchange, usually by using the non-devel- oping move a3. By the time White gets orga- nized, it's possible to have a situation in which Black has already castled and played ... b6 (or ... cS or ... dS), before White has developed any other piece besides his queen on c3 and knight on f3, and before he has moved a central pawn! For all that, the notion that White simply must have a small advantage in the Nirnzo-English persisted for years. It wasn't until the 1970s that 3 ... .i.b4 well and truly became mainstream, and even then the early theoreticians spoke cau- tiously about it, showing variations largely in fa- vour of White. After all, the reasoning goes, White is normally pleased to reach a position in which he has two bishops, no weaknesses, and no targets of attack for his opponent. What's more, he has the flexibility to play d4 whenever it seems appropriate, or to hold back while pur- suing other aims. In fact, the ultimate assess- ment of a slight advantage for White may still have validity. But to whatever extent that may be true, if any, it is not enough to deter the world's best players from adopting the black pieces, some using 3 ... .i.b4 as their main weapon and others reserving it for occasional use. Backing off for a moment, why is White play- ing some sequence of the moves c4, ttJc3 and ttJf3 in the first place? Unfortunately, that brings us back to the land of move-orders. First, it turns out that a high percentage of Nimzo-English games arise after 1 ttJf3 and 2 c4. In those cases, there are a couple of other options that make sense after, say 1 ttJf3 ttJf6 2 c4 e6. One is 3 g3, if one wants to allow a Catalan Opening follow- ing 3 ... d5 4 d4, or permit a Symmetrical English (with White committed to g3) after 3 ... cS, or of course head towards a Queen's Indian-like posi- tion following 3 ... b6. All of these are avoidable if one plays 3 ttJc3. White can of course revert to
3 d4 and play versus a Queen's Gambit, Queen's
Indian Defence or Nimzo-Indian Defence, but those aren't to everyone's taste. Turning to a player who uses the English Opening move-order 1 c4 ttJf6 2 ttJc3 e6, 3 ttJf3 is first of all a way of avoiding the Nimzo- Indian proper (3 d4 .i.b4).1t may also be based upon a distrust or aversion to 3 e4, which we ex- amined above. The move 3 g3, seldom played, transposes after 3 ... dS 4 d4 to a Catalan where White's queen's knight has been committed rather early to c3, normally an undesirable situ- ation. Looking at move-orders from the other side of the board, we can surmise that Black is probably a Nimzo-Indian player; after all, he is allowing White to play 4 d4, which trans- poses to a main line of that opening. At any rate, having committed to 1...ttJf6 and 2 ... e6, he prefers 3 ... .i.b4 to the Queen's Gambit that might arise after 3 ... dS 4 d4, or the Symmetri- cal English that results from 3 ... cS. Finally, Black can choose 3 ... b6, a relatively rare move which I won't be examining. The most interesting non-transpositional line is 4 e4 (4 d4 is a Queen's Indian Defence, and 4 g3 .i.b7 S .i.g2 will either head that way or into a Hedgehog, if Black plays ... cS) 4 ... .i.b7 S .i.d3! d6 (S ... cS 6 O-O ttJc6 7 eS! ttJg4 8 .i.e4 gives White a small advantage) 6 .i.c2 cS 7 d4 cxd4 8 ttJxd4, when White has a Maroczy Bind set-up that promises some advantage.

The 4 g4 Flank Attack Ilbf3lbf6 2 e4 e6 3lbc3.lib4 4 g4!? (D) This a fascinating move that attempts quite simply to attack on the flank without any prepa- ratory development, and in particular to drive Black's knight from the centre. The flank- before-centre strategy is a ubiquitous facet of modem chess that I haven't dealt with at length in these volumes, in part because the chosen variations are meant to be accessible to a general audience and tend to have a classical bent. Early flank moves are seen in almost every opening now, notably g4, h4, ... gS, ... hS and ... b5, but also in a two-step process such as a3 & b4, ... a6 & ... bS, h3 & g4, and ... h6 & ... gS. 4 g4 in the Nimzo-English has had a remarkably successful stretch from its introduction in the second half of the 1990s up to the present; it is the most important line for those who like orig- inal positions.
4 g4 is clearly an aggressive move, but its po-
sitional aspects also contribute to its viability. While a lot of the action will initially take place on the kingside, the centre becomes key in most variations. Inherent in the ... lbf6/ ... e6/ ... .lib4 set-up is Black's temporary abandonment of dark squares, notably d4 (as in the Nimzo-In- dian and Queen's Indian), all the more so when ... b6 and ... .lib7 are played. Since White has opened with the central move c4, he need only successfully dispute the e4-square in order to have a preponderance of the centre. That is nor- mally difficult in Nimzo/QID-style positions, but part of the strategy of driving off the f6- knight (or pinning it) is precisely to enhance White's control of e4. Also, to prevent ... .lixc3 from being effective, White's queen will very often be placed on c2. To quote Krasenkow, the most dedicated exponent of this system: "Gen- erally, the classical approach of the old theory is that flank attacks are only possible when the situation in the centre is stable (the centre is closed or seized by the attacker). That is not quite correct. Yes, a counterattack in the centre is the most effective reaction to the flank attack - but then everything depends on the steadiness of the centre. According to Nimzowitsch, even
330 MASTERING THE CHESS OPENINGS
a small but solid centre justifies a flank attack ... A battle of these two concepts (a flank attack vs a central counterattack) forms the strategic con- tents of a wide range of opening systems." In specific terms, 4 g4 targets Black's king- side dark squares, namely, the points f6 and g7. Therefore in many lines White will play b3 and .Bb2; in other positions, if ... h6 has been played, White will sometimes effect the advance gS anyway. Given time, he can combine further ideas such as tbe4 and h4-hS-h6. Black has a few ideas of his own to counter this complex of White's intentions. He can ex- pand in the centre, and it's amazing how many of Black's wins (and draws) include ... dS-d4. That not only interferes with White's pieces (especially if he places a bishop on b2), but it also increases the influence of Black's own pieces in the centre, typically a bishop on b7, a knight on c6, or a rook on d8. Achieving ... O-O-O is more difficult than might be imagined, but castling away from White's attack will often render it less effective. Black can also exploit the looseness of White's kingside position by aiming his pieces in that direction. A bishop on b7 can probe squares along the hl-a8 diagonal, especially f3, a queen on c7 and knight on g4 can target f4 and h2, and if Black plays ... h6 be- fore gS comes, his rook will often sit on an open h-file. Let's tum to a few games (with key examples in their notes) to see how this plays out. Krasenkow - Spoelman Wijk aan Zee 2007 1 tbf3 tbf6 2 c4 e6 3 tbc3 .Bb4 4 g4 This common move-order is equivalent to I c4 tbf6 2 tbc3 e6 3 tbf3 .Bb4 4 g4. 4 ... h6 A very popular move. Black prepares to meet gS on any of the next few moves with ... hxgS, when his h-file control will be a valuable asset. Furthermore, White's h4 and gS combination (so as to recapture with a pawn on gS) takes one more move to prepare (usually l:!.gl) because of the pin along the h-file. Here are some important alternatives to in- troduce you to the ideas: a) 4 ... tbxg4?! is almost never seen, because after Sl:!.gl, White's rook gets to g7 and severely weakens Black's kingside (for example, S. .. tbh6 6l:.i.xg7 tbfS 7 l:.i.gl or S. . .fS 6 h3 tbf6 7 l:.i.xg7). b) To my mind, the sign that 4 g4 is a play- able and logical move stems from the fact that the wholly natural response 4 ... dS, themati- cally answering a flank advance with a central one, isn't very effective; in fact, leading grand- masters seem to have given up on it entirely. After S gS (D), Black has two main continua- tions.

bl) S. .. .Bxc3 6 bxc3 (Krasenkow feels that 6 dxc3 tbe4 7 .Bg2 is also better for White; this looks clear enough, with bishops, space and easy development) 6 ... tbe4. Now White can en- ter the forcing sequence 7 d3! tbxc3 8 'ifb3! d4 9 tbxd4 ~xd4 10 .Bb2 ~f4 11 ~xc3 ~xgS 12 h4 ~h6, and while 13 ~xg7 ~xg7 14 .Bxg7 l:!.g8 IS J::tgl! gave White a positional advantage in Popov-Orlov, St Petersburg 1999, 13l:.i.gl! is better still; for example, 13 ... ng8 14 .iel!? ~xh4 ISl:hg7. b2) S. .. tbe4 6 h4 (6 ~a4+ tbc6 7 tbeS is also bothersome) 6 ... tbc6 7 ~c2 fS 8 gxf6!? (8 d3! tbxc3 9 bxc3 .Bd6 10 cxdS exdS 11 ~b3! eyes dS and b7, when after 11...~e7, both 12 .i.g2 .i.d7 13 l:.i.bl and 12 hS are better for White, and easier for him to play) 8. .. tbxf6 9 a3 .i.xc3 10 dxc3 "fiIe7 (White has an unobstructed bishop-pair after 1O ... dxc4 11 e4) 11 .igS .Bd7 (l1...dxc4!? 120-O-O eS may be best, when 13 hS!? is an aggressive alternative to 13 "fiIa4) and here instead of 12 O-O-O dxc4! (Zviagintsev- Piket, Tilburg 1998), White has 12 cxdS! exdS
13 O-O-O, reducing his opponent's counterplay.
Very likely the options on moves 6 and 8 are the main reasons why Black has given up on 4 ... dS.

At this point Black's pawn-structure is arguably superior; however, he still has a problem with his retarded develop- ment. Cornette-Adams, French Team Ch, Bor- deaux 2003 continued 9 'ii'c2liJc6 (D). w 10 h4liJb6 11 b3 g6 12liJd2 (heading for e4 and f6) 12 ... .JifS 13 .Jie4 (Krasenkow queries this, suggesting 13liJe4! with the point 13 ... dS? 14 .Jixb6 dxe4 IS .Jie3) 13 .. :~e6, and here both 14 hS and 140-0-00-O-O IS .Jixb6 axb6 16 hS Rb8 17 'it'b2 .Jixe4 18 'iixe4 give White an edge. d) In Ilyin-Aseev, Russian Ch, Krasnoiarsk 2003, Black played too passively and White's initiative came logically from his opening strat- egy: 4 ... d6 S gS liJfd7 6 'iVc2liJc6 7 a3 .Jixc3 8 'iVxc3 eS 9 b4 f6 (9 ...

IS .Jid2 'iVb616 e4 cxbS 17 ~b3 exd4 18 .JixbS ~d8 19 l;Ig7 with greater activity and attacking chances. After all these fine examples, we return to 4 ... h6 and the main game: 5 ~c2 (D) White's primary idea here is to cover the e4- square, both as a matter of general principle and in order to discourage a knight from landing there. In fact, S 1.tg 1 is more common, because White doesn't fear S. .. .Jixc3 6 dxc3. 5 ••. b6 Now S. .. dS!? doesn't work well due to 6 a3 .JiLf8 (6 ... .Jie7 7 d4 is a Queen's Gambit with accelerated kingside play for White) 7 d4liJxg4 8 .l:.g 1 liJf6 9 e4 with superb compensation in the form of space, superior development, and greater possession of the centre. 6a3 Mamedyarov-Naiditsch, Lausanne 2003 con- tinued 6 .l:tgl .Jib7 7 a3 i.f8 8 d4 d6 9 e4liJbd7 10 i.e3 a6 11 O-O-O (the big centre must give White the advantage) ll...cS 12 dS eS 13 h4 g6 14 gS! hxgS IS hxgS liJhS 16 .Jih3! i.g7 17 tlhl and White has the upper hand; one of Black's difficulties is that he can be attacked on the queenside if he goes that way. 6 ... i.e7 7 e4 i.b7 8 d4 It's true that Black's knight still watches over e4, but his bishop is no longer on b4 to help contest that square. Now Black challenges the centre, but it's a bit late. 8 ... d5 9 cxd5 exd510 e5liJe4 (D) w 11 i.b5+?! White would be in charge after 11 .i.d3!; for example, ll...liJgS!? 12 i.xgS hxgS 13 e6!,

This is Black's most fundamental response: bring the pieces out, castle, create no weakness, and let White's gS-pawn sit out there looking lonely. Nevertheless, it cooperates with White's basic idea when playing g4-gS, which is to chase the knight from control of central squares in order to gain time to pursue his flank attack with pawns.

White has carried out his strategy of opening the g-file and aiming his bishops at the enemy king, whereas Black has managed to advance his c- and d-pawns and has the superior centre.

12 King's Indian Variations
The majority of grandmasters who open the game with I c4 or 1 lLlf3 are happy to transpose into the 1 d4 version of the King's Indian De- fence if their opponents play the King's Indian moves ... lLlf6, ... g6, ... i..g7, ... d6 and ... O-O. Why? I) There are a wealth of interesting systems to play against the King's Indian Defence. 2) There is no Reti Opening set-up (lLlf3, c4 and double fianchetto) that promises a seri- ous advantage versus the King's Indian. Nevertheless, not everyone wants to face the preparation of a dedicated King's Indian player, and I want to address two versions of the King's Indian Defence that remain in the domain of the English Opening. One is the Botvinnik System versus the King's Indian, consisting of c4, lLlc3, g3, i..g2 and e4 in some sequence. This admit- tedly won't be available to White after I lLlf3, but is used by various players via the English Opening proper. For example, I mentioned 1 c4 eS 2 lLlc3 lLlc6 3 g3 g6 4 i..g2 i..g7 S e4 lLlf6 in the chapter on the Closed English and shall look at it here. Moreover, opening sequences like 1 c4 g6 2 lLlc3 i..g7 3 g3 eS 4 i..g2 d6 might encourage White to play S e4 and face S. .. lLlf6, or S. .. lLlc6 6 lLlge2 lLlf6. Another anti-King's Indian variation is espe- cially relevant to those who employ I lLlf3 with an early c4; for example, 1 lLlf3 lLlf6 2 c4 g6 3 lLlc3 i..g7 4 g3 d6 S i..g2 O-O 6 O-O eS. Now White holds back from d4 by using the modest 7 d3. Whether or not this achieves an advan- tage, it has been played and analysed for many years and is useful for both sides to understand. Botvinnik Variation vs the King's Indian The majority of English Opening players who like the Botvinnik set-up would rather use it against a King's Indian Defence than any other. That arises naturally after 1 c4 lLlf6 2 lLlc3 g6 3 g3 i..g7 4 i..g2 O-O S e4 d6 6 lLlge2 (D):

Here 6 ... eS completes the King's Indian structure that we'll be looking at in this chapter, but take a look at the first note in the following game to clarify what the move-order issues are. Petrosian - Bertok Zagreb 1965
1 c4 lLlf6 2 lLlc3 g6 3 e4 d6 4 g3 i..g7 5 i..g2
e5 This game actually began with 1 c4 eS, but I've adjusted the move-order to make an impor- tant point. Regardless of which sequence of moves White picks, it's difficult for him to avoid a Symmetrical English should his oppo- nent so choose; that is, Black can abstain from playing ... eS until White has already committed to e4 and a Botvinnik formation. Then, once e4 is played, Black can set up with ... cS instead of ... eS. For example, at this point in our game, the sequence S ... cS 6 lLlge2 lLlc6 enters the Sym- metrical Botvinnik lines (see Chapter 7). Simi- larly, with the conventional move-order' 1 c4 lLlf6 2 lLlc3 g6 3 g3 i..g7 4 .i.g2 O-O S e4, Black can play S ... cS. White needs to take this into ac- count because he either has to have a system
336 MASTERING THE CHESS OPENINGS
prepared versus ... cS variations, or he has to limit himself to playing the Botvinnik System only when Black has committed to an early B ... eS. Of course, that covers a lot of territory. Finally, Black can play ... c6 without ... eS, but these lines are less well-defined and for rea- sons of space I've concentrated upon ones that overlap with l...eS variations. 6lbge2lbc6 This is arguably the most important move, because it can occur via a number of move- orders. Instead, 6 ... O-O 7 O-O lbbd7 (or 7 ... c6 8 d3 lbbd7) places Black's knight more flexibly in return for reduced control over d4. One of his most common ideas is to play for ... bS; for ex- ample, 8 d3 (8 f4 c6 9 h3 bS! 10 cxbS cxbS has ideas of ... b4, ... Jlb7 and/or ... dS) 8 ... c6 9 h3 (9 f4 bS! gains a tempo for attack due to the b- pawn defence by .. .'iVb6+) 9 ... a6 (9 ... aS!? 10 Jle3l:tb8 has a similar look: 11 f4 bS 12 fS bxc4 13 dxc4 lbb6 14 b3 gxfS IS .i.gS dS 16 exdS cxdS 17 cxdS ~d6 18 ~h2 Jld7 19 "iVd2 a4 20 bxa4 lIa8 21 l:.abl lbxa4 22 lbxa4 .l:i.xa4 with chances for both sides, Kotov-Geller, Lenin- grad 19S6) 10 Jle3 (10 a4, to prevent ... bS, has the drawback that 1O ... aS! secures cS as an outpost for Black's knight) 1O ... bS 11 ~d2 .i.b7 12 f4 exf4 13 gxf4 .l:.e8 14lbg3 lbb6 IS a4 b4 16lbce2 as 17 b3 cS 18l:tadl 'fie7 with dynamic equality, Lein-Vasiukov, USSR Ch, Tbilisi 196617. These lines with ... c6 are impos- sible to reduce to general ideas, and most games stemming from them will take on a unique char- acter. 7 d3
7 O-O O-O 8 f4 (D) is a common way to try to
get fS in before Black has time to block the f- pawn by moving his knight from f6 and playing .. .fS. Black has to act quickly: a) He can try to compromise White's big centre by 8 ... exf4 9 gxf4 Jlg4 10 d4 lbhS, but after 11 Jle3, he can't quite seem to break it down, because 11...fS 12 eS dxeS leaves White with a clear positional plus following 13 dxeS! (and not 13 fxeS? f4!). b) In Bilek-Liptay, Hungarian Ch, Budapest 1963, 8 ...

7 ••• i.e6 This is a flexible move that doesn't commit the queen's knight, which can still come to c6, d7 or a6. In the last two cases the move ... c6 will be available. The main point is that by attacking c4, he forces a reaction and has time to prevent h3 by getting .. .'.\~'d7 in. Without the move h3, it's more difficult for White to play i.e3 due to ... tDg4. In addition, Black's defensive move ... i.g4 can come in handy. Not surprisingly, White has his own advan- tages in this formation. If he gets either d4 or f4 in and Black captures the pawn, then tDxd4 or tDxf4 will attack Black's bishop on e6. Also, if White plays f4, he can play fS with a gain of time, even as a pawn sacrifice. Finally, the move tDdS can sometimes be answered by ... tDxdS, but that will now come with loss of tempo due to the attack on e6. Black can play the same idea with his knight already committed to c6 (for example, from a Closed English move-order), but this doesn't seem as effective: 7 ... tDc6 8 d3 (or 8 f4; com- pare the notes in the previous game) 8 ... i.e6 (instead of 8 ... tDe8 and ... fS) 9 h3 tDe8 (9 .. :~d7 10 'iii>h2 tDhS 11 tDdS tDd8?!, Averbakh-Traj- kovic, Dresden 19S6, and now Marin suggests 12 g4! tDf613 f4) 10 lIbl as 11 a3 ~d7 12 'iii>h2 fS 13 exfS gxfS 14 f4 (D).

standard blockade of Black's f-pawn, which re- stricts the mobility of his pieces. We've seen versions of this position in many variations. The exchange ... exf4 would isolate Black's f- pawn after White recaptures with a piece, and ... e4 will lose material. So Black is best off maintaining the status quo in the centre and looking to improve the position of his pieces. White stands better, but his advantage is lim- ited. 8d3

idea is to prepare d4. One solution is 8 ... liJc6 9 d3 liJd7!? 10 .i.e3, and now 1O ... f5 11 exf5 .i.xf5 is only slightly better for White.

8 e4 is mentioned in the next game.
B
This position has been the starting point for a remarkable number of master games over the years. White sets up as he often does in the Closed English (Chapter 6). He has in mind b4-bS, in a sense 'extending' the effective reach of his favourite bishop on g2 by controlling squares along that diagonal. 8l:tbl has the addi- tional advantage of removing the rook from po- tential attacks by the g7-bishop. We looked at this type of position in the Closed English chapter at some length, but with Black's pawn on fS. I think it's fair to say that, although there are always trade-offs, the position with ... fS in is more difficult for White to fight against be- cause Black's pawn attack is well underway. One way of looking at it is that, in our variation, Black will move his knight from f6 and play .. .fS, which raises the question of whether he has not somehow lost a tempo in doing so. Naturally it's not so easy. It's true that there are many variations in which Black moves his knight and plays ... fS, but doesn't mean that those are the best variations, or that ... fS can't sometimes be a weakening move. Indeed, over the years, leading players have turned towards defending Black's queenside with pieces, and in the main lines he plays ... ltJf6-d7. Then it can be argued that Black has saved a tempo by not playing .. .fS! Which way is better? It all de- pends upon which plan you think is appropri- ate, and which you feel more comfortable with. Finally, I should note that I haven't allocated space to variations with an early ... c6; for exam- ple, 1 c4 ltJf6 2 ltJc3 g6 3 g3 i..g7 4 i..g2 d6 S ltJf3 O-O 6 O-O eS 7 d3 c6, or here 7 ... l:te8, or 7 ... h6 8l:tbl as 9 a3 .l:Ie8. In each case, Black's first, direct idea is simply ... c6 and ... dS, which is usually prefaced by protecting the e-pawn. Such lines are extremely difficult to analyse precisely, but they are respectable and involve less theory, which is perhaps an advantage in some players' minds. S• •• i..d7!? This old move is hardly used any more, al- though it really hasn't been refuted. Black wants to play .. :~c8 and ... i..h3, exchanging White's bishop on g2 and initiating an attack on the kingside. With 8 ... i..d7, he wants to save the time spent on ... h6, as in the main lines 8 ... h6 9 b4 i..e6 and 8 ... aS 9 a3 h6. Without ... h6, a bishop on e6 can be harassed by ltJgS. Of course, 8 ... i..d7 is rather passive, and a queen on c8 is less effectively placed than on d7. If Black inserts the moves 8 ... aS 9 a3 before playing 9 ... i..d7, his queen on c8 makes it diffi- cult to contest the a-file after 10 b4 axb4 11 axb4 'iUc8 12 bS ltJe7 13 i..b2 i..h3 14l:tal.
9 b4 'iVcs 10 b5ltJe7 lll:tel (D)
This classic game illustrates some fundamen- tal themes. First, we see in its most direct form the plan with ~bl and b4-bS that typifies so many variations in the English Opening. Then we see White trying to save his bishop from ex- change by playing l1l:tel, so that when Black plays ... i..h3, White can retreat his bishop to hI without losing the exchange to ... i..xfl. This costs a tempo and weakens f2, so Black's usual response will be to launch a kingside attack.

1l• •• il.h3 12 il.hlttJg4? A mistake, although it doesn't change the natural course of the game because White fails to seize upon its tactical shortcoming. The ac- curate move is 12 ... h6, when 13 ~c2 ttJg4 transposes to the game. Whether ... ttJg4 is su- perior to other plans is another matter; one drawback is that it reduces control of the centre. 13 'ii'c2? A sound move, but missing the tactic 13 ttJgS!, which attacks the bishop on h3. Then 13 ... ttJf6 14 il.xb7! 'ii'xb7 lSttJxh3 isn't a very effective gambit for Black. Apart from this technicality, White's choice of c2 for the queen is noteworthy. It would seem that b3 is a better square, guarding dS and sup- porting the potential attack by cS and b6. In fact, that's where the queen usually goes in the games below. 13•.• h614ttJd5! ttJxd515 cxd5 (D)

This is the point. Black's only weakness is at c7, and now White's queen faces it directly. 15••. f5 lS ... ttJf6 16 ~c4 .:te8, with the idea ... .:te7 and if necessary ... ttJe8, would be an admission that his kingside action was premature. Still, it would be interesting to see how White would make progress in that case. 16 il.d2 f4 Black is hoping that something will happen on that weak f2-square.

The star move. This rook not only prepares to go to c4 and further pile up on the weak pawn, but it also plays a role in defending the kingside along the 4th rank. 18••• ttJf6! Black retreats in order to attack dS, but the more so to defend c7 with his next move. 19l:tc4 (D)
B
A classical picture of the English Opening queenside assault. White has tripled on the c- file, and an advance by a4-aS and b6 is on the cards. Black's plan is less obvious, because af- ter his next move he has only a couple of pieces in the attack. 19••• ttJe8 Not 19 ... ttJxdS? 20 ttJxeS!, and either dS or f7 falls.
20 a4 g5 21 il.el
White's pieces coordinate well. His bishop move protects the kingside (especially the sen- sitive f2), and prepares ttJd2-e4. Nevertheless, he needs a concrete way to proceed, and his pieces are mostly cut off from the kingside. Since Black's bishop on h3 has turned into a monster, 21 il.g2 was a sensible option. 21 ••• il.f6?!

2l...'iVg4! 22 liJd2 'iVh5 looks satisfactory, with enough danger to White's king that he has to pay attention. 22 liJd2 i.d8?

8 e4 is usually frowned upon with this dispo-
sition of pieces. White has constructed a Bot- vinnik System pawn-structure, but his knight on f3 blocks his f-pawn (as opposed to having it on the normal e2-square). That really isn't such an awful circumstance, but since Black can move his knight and be ready to play .. .f5 him- self, he can equalize rather easily. Giinthner- Uhlmann, German Ch, Bad Wildbad 1993 pro- ceeded 8 ... liJh5 9 i.g5! f6 (9 ... i.f6 is a sound alternative) 10 i.e3 i.e6 11 h3 liJe7 (reintro- ducing the idea of ... c6 and ... d5) 12liJd5 c6 13 liJxe7+ 'iVxe7 14liJel 'iVf7 with a level game. In this line, 8 ... a6 with the idea ... b5 is also attractive, because White's usual counterbreak with f4 isn't on hand.
8. .. a5
Black plays this move far more often than not, and it goes well with the defensive system that he chooses for this game. 9a3 White naturally tries to enforce b4. 9 ..• liJd4 (D) 9 ... h6 is the focus of the next game. Throughout the years, this knight incursion has proven frustrating to White. It eliminates some of the force of White's queenside attack and prepares central expansion with ... c6 and ... d5. The possibility of ... c6 is also useful in preventing White's knight from becoming set- tled on d5. Finally, if White exchanges the knight on d4, Black hopes to use his open e-file in conjunction with ... i.g4 to cause White some problems. As for White, he can take some comfort in the fact that the attack by ... f5 is put on hold, which means that he can shift his forces to the queenside and centre without fear. Black has expended a tempo on ... liJd4, so that gives White some extra time to expand on the queenside. Be- cause of the simplification that ... liJd4 promises, he can also play i.g5 followed by i.xf6, hoping to simplify the game and reduce Black's control over the crucial e4- and d5-squares. This makes the assumption that his knights will be better than Black's passive dark-squared bishop. How- ever, that kind of imbalance tends to be only a temporary advantage. 10b4 a) It might seem natural to kick the black knight by 10 e3 liJxf3+ 11 i.xf3, but after
11...c6, there's no stopping ... d5 without con-
cessions; for example, 12 b4 (12 e4 i.e6 13 b4 axb4 14 axb4 d5) 12 ... axb4 13 axb4 d5 14 b5 i.e6 15 'iVe2 ~d7 16 i.b2l:.fe8 and, because of her greater central control, Black was slightly better in Schoenberger-Dworakowska, Krynica 1995. b) 10 liJxd4 has proven harmless; for exam- ple, 1O ... exd4 11 liJb5 (White doesn't achieve anything by llliJd5 c6 {11.. .a4!? has also been played, to hold up White on the queenside} 12 liJxf6+ i.xf6 13 e4 dxe3 14 fxe3 a4 with a dull equality, Norwood-Iten, Zug 1987) ll...liJg4 (or ll...liJe8 with the idea ... c6) 12 h3 c6 13 hxg4 i.xg4 14liJxd4 i.xd4 15 'iVd2 ~d7 16 b4 axb4 17 l:txb4 l:tfe8 18 e3 i.g7 19 i.b2 and nothing special was going on in Christiansen- Smyslov, Lone Pine 1976. c) 10 i.g5 (D) is the most important alterna- tive.

Black's advantage of two bishops will be set against White's attack on the queenside. Razu- vaev-Ikonnikov, Geneva 1994 continued 1O ... h6 (10 ... liJe6 11 .i.xf6 i.xf6 is also possible) 11 i.xf6 i.xf6 12 b4 axb4 13 axb4 i.g7 (there doesn't seem to be any hurry about this, be- cause ... fS isn't in Black's plans for a while, so 13 ..

The course of the game demonstrates how the timing of this move is slightly flawed. But Black has probably already equalized. There are two main options: a) 13 bxc6 bxc6 and now 14 liJxd4?! still doesn't inspire following 14 ... exd4 IS liJe4 liJxe4 16 i.xe4 'iVd7 with the idea ... dS, as in Anikaev-Tal, Minsk 1979. 14l:!.el and 14 e3 would be better tries. b) A particularly interesting variation from a positional point of view comes from the game that initially made the i.gS plan popu- lar: 13 i.gS i.xf3 14 i.xf3 h6!? (not bad, but 14 .. J~.a3! would equalize after IS ~c1 ~aS16 :tal .l:ta8, and here ISliJe4liJxf3+ 16 exf3 dS gives Black the larger share of the centre) IS i.xf6 liJxf3+ 16 exf3 i.xf6 17 bxc6 bxc6 18 lIb7 (D).

This is White's idea: light-square control combined with possession of open queenside files, with a good knight versus a (tempo- rarily) bad bishop. Still, Black's mobile centre is a countervailing factor and White has long- term weaknesses. Andersson-Nunn, Johannes- burg 1981 continued 18 ..

Here are two of the several alternatives: a) 13 ... c6 14 i.a3l:te8. Black removes him- self from the potential pin from the bishop on a3, in part because he would like to play ... dS in certain lines; if he can do so and White is un- able to break down the centre, there's no reason to think Black hasn't equalized. Black also has the idea of ... lDfS and perhaps ... lDd4. Bareev- Bacrot, Sarajevo 2000 continued ISlIfc1! (the natural IS lDd2 allows IS ... dS!, because eS is no longer attacked) IS ... gS?!
