Talking about things like 'the point of this book' or 'how to use this book' strikes me as ludi crous - the point of this book is to try to teach some stuff to a reader, and it is best used by read ing some and preferably a lot of it. So now that I've confessed my shortcomings, I'll try to write something approaching an introduction, promising nothing except brevity. In my limited coaching experience, I've often had to explain various openings to my stu dents. Most of these openings I don't play myself, so I had to acquire some sort of working knowledge (from opening manuals, databases, player biographies, tournament reports, lec tures and blitz games) into all the main variations likely to arise in my students' games. What I call 'working knowledge' is an understanding of where the pieces go and why they go there, a basic idea of what both sides want from a particular position and how they might try to get it. This kind of information used to be contained in books called opening primers, which died out for some reason. Perhaps people thought that, with the rapid growth of opening knowledge, a single relatively small volume couldn't deal with all the openings unless there was no explana tion but just endless reams of variations. They could be right, but I think (and hope) that the op posite is the case - precisely because of the growth of chess data, when even club players have extensive databases, what is needed is a simple verbal introduction to each opening, coupled with some of the most important main lines and indicative variations. This is the way I try to explain openings to my students, and this is the way I've tried to write this book. So at its nar rowest, this book consists of the notes I plan to refer to before I teach someone a specific open ing - at its broadest, it's a series of lessons in openings for club players. I'm sure a lot of people at extremes of the rating spectrum won't get anything out of it - either because they find it too detailed or too simplistic - but hopefully most players in need of a general opening education will find this book sufficient to provide it. Two points remain, one about me and one about you. First, this book is written by me, and while I would call it broadly objective it could still be called a personal view of modem open ings. Accordingly, at certain points I mention alternatives to main-line theory or advocate sidelines which I think are more promising than well-trodden paths, and I warn the reader against certain lines, not because a top GM refuted it but because 'I don't like creating such a big centre before I'm fully developed' or something similar. I think I've always included the main variations even ifl prefer alternatives, and when I'm expressing a personal opinion rather than theoretical 'fact' I've flagged it as such, but the conclusions drawn in this book should al ways be tested against the reader's own chess sensibilities, assimilated if they make sense and rejected if they don't. Second, I think this book makes sense (I'm in serious trouble if it doesn't) but it only makes complete sense in its entirety. Certain positions (for instance, involving an isolated queen's pawn) arise so often in so many openings that it wasn't practical to explain a typical position each time it came up - instead, a comment like 'with a typical IQP position' is all the reader gets, while the complete discussion of IQP positions is confined to the Nimzo Indian section since this is the opening which creates this structure most often. Similarly
10 UNDERSTANDING THE CHESS OPENINGS
Maroczy Bind positions pop up all the time, but for a better understanding of them the reader should look to the discussion in the Sicilian section. So the book is best read as a whole, though not necessarily in any particular order - each section informs each other section to a certain extent, and I think this mirrors modern opening play, when a good idea in one context is quickly borrowed and applied in a bunch of other settings. I'm in danger of breaking my promise. Hope you like the book. Sam Collins Dublin 2005 Section 1: Open Games le4 e5(D) w Open Games are the logical place to start both one's chess education and this book. 1 e4 has the following benefits: 1 ) It gains central control (of the d5- square). 2) It allows the fl -bishop (and, where ap propriate, the queen) to develop, and gives the gl -knight another square. 3) Because of point '2' , it brings White one move closer to kingside castling. An obvious complement would be 2 d4, with potential development of every minor piece and excellent central control. In order to frustrate 2 d4, as well as to get all of the above benefits for himself, Black plays l . ..e5. Italian Game

This move signals the beginning of the Italian Game. The development of White's bishop to c4 prepares castling, eyes the f7- pawn and hinders an early ... d5. We would need a pretty compelling reason not to play such an obviously logical move and unfortu nately such abstention is justified by the fact that Black, by most accounts, has a pretty easy route to equality in all variations. At tention has thus moved away from the Ital ian Game, with its more durable neighbour the Spanish Game (Ruy Lopez) proving a more promising route to an enduring edge for White. The Italian Game has several distinct branches. Initially, Black used to respond in kind with 3 ... i.c5 (a move still very popular today, and quite probably Black's clearest route to equality). We'll examine White's various attempts to get something against this, from the early systems based on blowing Black off the board with c3 and d4, through the tricky and interesting Evans Gambit, to the current fashion of quiet d3 systems, pre paring solid development before further cen tral adventures. Then we must examine the Two Knights Defence, which arises after 3 ... tt:'lf6 ! ?
(D).
w This is a more ambitious attempt by Black to wrest the initiative. Perfect Centre This structure is the classical ideal. It comes about when White supports his d-pawn with c3, and Black exchanges with ... exd4 cxd4. The white pawns dominate the centre and give White more space, which enables him to develop his pieces actively.
ITALIAN GAME 13
Black has two options: either restrain the pawns with ...d6 followed by putting pres sure on e4 (with a knight on f6 and a rook on e8, for instance), or (more actively) to get one of the pawns to move, whereupon the centre loses a great deal of its flexibility and thus is easier to attack. This is achieved by hitting the e-pawn with ... ti:Jf6 or ...d5. Bishop Exchanges 8 I've selected a very boring position from the Giuoco Piano to talk about captures for a moment. In the diagram position, captures are bad, and here's why: 1 ) If the black bishop takes on e3, then af ter fxe3 White has strengthened his centre as well as now having a half-open f-file to work on. Also he's covered the d4-square. 2) If White plays ..txc5, then after ...dxc5 Black has increased his control over d4 with his pawn and the d-file with his major pieces. "But what about Black's doubled pawns?" What indeed. Doubled pawns, trebled pawns, exposed kings in the middle of the board, knights stuck on a8 - nothing in chess is a weakness unless it can be attacked. Doubled pawns are prima facie weaker than other pawns, because instead of having a pawn on an adjacent file (which can protect it) it now has a pawn behind it (which can't), but this doesn't mean that they're vulnerable in every position. The key to using one's pawns well lies in one key idea - pawns should serve pieces, not the other way around. So your pieces shouldn't be stuck defending pawns, but if your pawn-structure is offering you open files for your rooks and beautiful out posts for your pieces then it's a good struc ture; it doesn't matter what it looks like. Giuoco Piano

w This is the Giuoco Piano. Three systems deserve consideration: 1 ) 4 c3 followed by an immediate d4. If Black isn't careful he can end up very lost very quickly, but theoretically White is strug gling to equalize against precise defence. 2) The Giuoco Pianissimo ('very quiet game') variations with d3. 3) 4 b4 ! ?, the Evans Gambit, which has been tried by several strong players (the Brit ish grandmaster and former world champion ship contender Nigel Short has used this on and off for several years, with mixed results).

of time in the execution of White's central advance, the black bishop is lured to a square from which it will have to run after a c3 ad vance. A subtler point is that, with the disap pearance of the b-pawn, .lta3 can come into play in some variations. As with so many of the romantic open ings, today the Evans is regarded as playable but toothless. Black has a variety of ways to return material while totally equalizing. 4 ... .ltxb4!

w While the safe 3 . . . i.c5 has never been un der a cloud, more ambitious players began to search for something a little more aggres sive than the sedate waters of the Giuoco Pi anissimo. The Two Knights Defence fits the bill - by immediately launching an attack on the e4-pawn, Black tries to seize the initia tive. This is the first truly counterattacking line for Black that we have examined in the book so far. There are three paths White can consider: 1 ) The main line, 4 lLig5, putting the fin ger on the main problem with this knight de velopment. There is no convenient way to defend the f7 -pawn, so Black needs to launch an immediate attack, and we'll see how he does just this. 2) Defending the e4-pawn - Black should have no problems here, whether he chooses to transpose into Giuoco Pianissimo territory or keep the game in the Two Knights De fence. 3) The Max Lange Attack with 4 d4 - again a line which, while it has had its fair share of glorious victories, seems dead and buried by current theory.

King's Gambit

The King's Gambit is something of a has been. While 2 f4 was considered mandatory among gentlemen of the 19th century, with time and the evolution of defensive technique the opening has gradually developed an hor rendous reputation, to the point where even today's rabid attacking players hold it in dis dain: Shirov has given the move a 'dubious' annotation, while Morozevich commented on his choice of 2 liJf3 that "I used to blunder a pawn with 2 f4 exf4, but now I have grown up." The King's Gambit is still a viable choice but neither an advantage nor an attack against a well-prepared defender is assured. 2 . • . exf4 (D) The critical test of a gambit is normally its acceptance, and this is especially true here. In fact White isn't really threatening 3 fxe5 in view of 3 ... 'i!Vh4+ 4 g3 'iWxe4+ picking up a rook, and so Black has some flexibility in his choice of defence. However, White can gen erate some advantage against all the lines where Black declines the pawn. 2 ... i.c5 3 liJf3 d6 4 liJc3 liJf6 5 i.c4 liJc6 6 d3 i.g4 7 lZJa4 i.b6 8 liJxb6 axb6 9 O-O gives White a risk-free edge. 2 ... liJf6 3 liJf3 liJxe4 4 d3 liJc5 5 fxe5 d5 6 d4 liJe6 7 c4 i.b4+ 8 i.d2 i.xd2+ 9 'ifxd2 c6 10 liJc3 and White has a useful space advan tage. 2 ...d5 3 exd5 e4 4 d3 liJf6 5 dxe4 lZJxe4 6 liJf3 i.c5 7 'ii' e2 i.f5 8 liJc3 'ife7 9 i.e3 ! is good for White - 9 ... i.xe3 10 'ifxe3 liJxc3 1 1 'iWxe7+ <tixe7 1 2 bxc3 i.xc2 1 3 <tid2 with a strong initiative. w 3 liJf3 The main line, but there are some alterna tives.

w Despite the apparent symmetry, there are three factors in White's favour: 1 ) His c4-pawn is better than the one on c6, since it attacks d5 (and can push to c5) while its counterpart merely defends. 2) The knight on e4, even though it seems well placed, would rather be back on f6, since on its current post it can be harassed with .:.e1 , ._.c2 and lt:Jc3. 3) It's White's move. Having said all this, Black is obviously very solid and is just a couple of tempi away from full equality. White has tried several lines, and it is unclear which is best. My own preference would be 9 'ii' c2 lt:Ja6 1 0 a3 i..g4 1 1 lt:Je5 , when Black needs to be very pre cise - even in the theoretical recommenda tion of 1 l ...i..xe5 ( l l .. .i..h5 1 2 cxd5 cxd5 1 3 lt:Jc3 is also nice for White) 1 2 dxe5 lt:Jac5 ! ? 1 3 f3 lt:Jxd3 14 'ifxd3 lt:Jc5 1 5 'i!Vd4 lt:Jb3 1 6 ._.xg4 lt:Jxa1 1 7 i..h6 his position is on a knife edge.

I've tried to present this as if .. :fie?

Accordingly Black realized he needed some more control over f4, while still facilitating his own devel opment, and came up with this gem. Play typically now runs:

This opening, known as the Ruy Lopez (or Spanish) is the most popular Open Game. It has been regarded as sound for several centu ries, and now is firmly established as White's best attempt for an advantage after l ...e5. As Nunn points out, it is misleading to regard the Ruy Lopez as a single opening - in reality it is a collection of numerous different systems. White's third move has quite a simple idea - by threatening the exchange of the c6-knight, White pressurizes the e5-pawn. As it happens, the immediate i.xc6 isn't a threat, but it soon will be and White hopes that, while Black is stabilizing his centre, there will be time for completing develop ment and building a menacing centre with c3 and d4. With such a huge opening as this, there are numerous ways of splitting up the reader's work, but I think a logical way follows this pattern: 1) Systems without 3 ...a6. This little pawn move, pioneered by the great American Paul Morphy, is easily Black's most popular de fence and marks the beginning of the main lines. First we look at Black's less popular (though still playable) alternatives, such as 3 ...d6, 3 ... tbd4, 3 ... i.c5, 3 ...g6 and the in creasingly popular 3 ... tbf6. 2) Systems with 3 . . .a6 (excluding the Closed Lopez). These lines revolve around early activity for Black, generally involving an active development of the dark-squared bishop (to c5) or a capture of the e4-pawn (the Open Lopez). Here we'll also deal with White's early deviations, such as the Ex change Variation (4 i.xc6), the Deferred Ex change, and lines with d3, 'ii e2 or an early d4. 3) The Closed Lopez (and the Marshall). These lines are the backbone of Lopez the ory. Kingside Manoeuvres w Some typical Ruy Lopez manoeuvres are indicated in the diagram. For White, lbbd2-fl -g3 (or e3 sometimes) is almost mandatory, taking aim at the f5- square and moving some more wood to the kingside where his chances generally lie. He can further increase the pressure with tbf3- h2-g4, and if Black takes then recapture with the h-pawn and attack down the h-file. Lki

For Black, the indicated kingside reorgani zation is often an excellent plan - on g7 the bishop defends the king and pressurizes the centre, while the g6-pawn covers f5. Ruy Lopez Part 1

Thus Black has a move's grace, so to speak, and here we' ll look at his attempts to make use of this with out playing 3 ... a6. First, we'll examine the systems where Black immediately attacks the e4-pawn - these are the Berlin Defence (3 ... lt:Jf6) and the Schliemann (3 ...f5). Next we'll look at lines where Black aims for an early ...d6 - these include the Steinitz Defence (3 ...d6) and some lines of the Classi- cal Defence (3 ... i.c5).

This is the Berlin Defence. While it was al ways regarded as a playable move, the line was used infrequently until Vladimir Kram nik used it repeatedly to neutralize Garry Kasparov in their 2000 BGN world champi onship match. This was followed by a wave of top-level activity in the line, during which several new and promising continuations for White were discovered. Now its popularity has faded somewhat, but it's still a perfectly viable continuation for Black, especially if he's willing to defend a slightly inferior w endgame with a view to outplaying his oppo nent later.

After 6 i¥e2 tbd6 7 il.xc6 bxc6 8 dxe5 lbb7 the 2nd World Champion stated "I do not believe that White has any advantage, and am rather inclined to attribute the greater viability to the party that has kept its forces a little farther back", but modem GMs seem to be agreed that White has an edge here due to his space advantage and easier development. After 9 tbc3 O-O 10 l:te 1 tbc5 1 1 il.e3 tbe6 1 2 �ad 1 Black still has problems to solve. 5 ...a6 ! ? is a sneaky move-order for those who like the Open Ruy Lopez but are un willing to face White's early alternatives, especially the Exchange Variation.

1 e4 e5 2 �f3 �c6 3 i..b5 (D)
8 3 ...f5 This is the Schliemann Defence. Always regarded as too dubious for regular top-level practice (the weakening of the a2-g8 and h5- e8 diagonals can lead to big problems), it has been the darling of correspondence players who seem to devote years of analysis to junk lines. The Schliemann hasn't quite been re futed yet, but White has a pleasant choice of lines all of which maintain at least an edge. 3 ...d6 4 d4 i..d7 5 �c3 exd4 6 �xd4 g6 (6 ...�f6 7 O-O i..e7 is a more classical way of handling the system, which gives White an effortless edge; after 8 i;le 1 O-O 9 i..xc6 bxc6 1 0 'i!fd3 l:te8 1 1 b3, followed by i.b2 and l:tad 1 , White is very comfortable) 7 i.. e3 i..g7 8 'i¥d2 �f6 9 i..xc6 bxc6 10 i..h6 O-O 1 1 i..xg7 �xg7 leaves Black passive. Such a move as 3 ... i..c5 can hardly be called illogical, but it is safe to say that the early bishop development has never really caught on as a defence to the Ruy Lopez. Compared to the Giuoco Piano, here Black has much more cause to be worried about his e5-pawn, while the stock plan of c3 and d4 is still on the cards. 4 O-O (White can try to ex ploit the position of the black bishop with 4 c3, but after 4 ...�f6 ! 5 d4 exd4 6 e5 �e4 7 cxd4 i..b4+ 8 �bd2 O-O 9 O-O d5 ! Black is well placed and shouldn't be worse) and now: a) 4 ...�d4 aims to get an improved version of the Bird Defence (3 ... �d4), but White has little trouble maintaining an advantage: 5 �xd4 i.xd4 6 c3 i..b6 7 d4 c6 8 i.c4 d6 leaves White a little better, while 5 b4 ! ? is quite a promising gambit. b) I'm not wild about 4 ...d6 when 5 c3 !, intending d4, poses major problems for Black. c) 4 ...�f6 is, of course, a position that can also be reached via a Berlin move-order. 5 �xe5 !? (White has a pleasant choice here be tween this move and 5 c3 O-O 6 d4 i..b6 7 i.g5, where he also holds a nice advantage) 5 ...�xe5 6 d4 a6 7 i..e2 i.e7 8 dxe5 �xe4 9 c4 ! O-O 10 'i!fc2 and White has the better chances. 3 ... �d4. One of the more interesting alter natives to the main line, the Bird has been used as a surprise weapon by some top play ers, most recently by Khalifman against Kas parov (successfully in their first game, but disastrously in the rematch). Now 4 i..c4 is possible, when 4 ... i..c5 5 �xd4 i.xd4 6 c3 i.b6 7 d4 leaves White better but 4 ... 'ili'f6 and 4 ...�f6 are interesting. However, 4 �xd4 is obviously critical - the black pawns are dou bled, and the e5-pawn is dragged away, al lowing White to march his f-pawn in some lines. 4 ...exd4 5 O-O i.c5 (5 ...c6 6 i..c4 d5 was Khalifman 's choice - after 7 exd5 cxd5 8 i.b5+ i..d7 9 :e1 + �e7 White is slightly better following both 10 a4 and 10 c4) 6 d3 c6 7 i..a4 ! (the most testing line) 7 ...�e7 8 f4 ! f5 9 i.b3 is just nasty for Black - I think his fifth-move alternative is worth a look. 3 ...g6 was used several times by former World Champion Vasily Smyslov, who had quite a knack for inventing novel systems of

Thus White must react energetically to obtain any advantage. 4 d4! exd4 5 i.g5 i.e7 6 i.xe7 "i/xe7. The exchange of Black' s dark-squared bishop has already neutralized the fianchetto. Now 7 i.xc6 ! ? dxc6 8 'ifxd4 tbf6 9 tbc3 gives White a pleasant edge - normally Black needs two bishops to com pensate for this shoddy pawn-structure. 3 ... tt:Jge7 4 O-O g6 is a closely related vari ation.

Now we return to the position after 3 .. .f5
(D):
w 4 tt:Jc3 This is theoretically critical, but White needs to know his stuff here in order to main tain the advantage. I suspect that what puts a lot of players off the Schliemann is that, while the main line is dubious enough, White has a few fourth-move alternatives which maintain a risk-free edge. 4 d3, simply holding the centre, is sensible - it looks like d3 has helped White more than .. . f5 has helped Black. 4 'ife2 ! ? is quite a venomous move, with the idea that after 4 .. .fxe4 5 i.xc6 ! White wins material.
4 d4 is logical, striking in the centre, but
the position after 4 .. .fxe4 5 i.xc6 dxc6 6 tbxe5 is far from clear. 4 i.xc6 ! ? is better than its reputation: 4 ... dxc6 5 tbc3 lDf6 6 'i¥e2 and Black will have difficulty holding his centre. 4 ...fxe4 Initiating enormous complications. 4 ... ctJf6 5 exf5 is good for White, since 5 ...e4 6 ctJh4 ! holds the important pawn on f5, which blocks both Black's light-squared bishop and his f file counterplay. 5 t£'Jxe4 dS 6 ctJxeS dxe4 7 t£'Jxc6 (D)

Finally, we get to the real reason why the Lopez is played. This position is the strategi cally richest of all Open Games. Basically, White intends c3 and d4 to win control of the centre, followed by t'bbd2-fl -g3 with good chances of kingside pressure, as well as a handy a4 advance to soften up the black queenside. In response, Black has several op tions. The first line we' ll look at is the radical Marshall Attack, 7 . ..O-O 8 c3 d5 ! ?, where Black sacrifices an important pawn in return for an intimidating attack. Many players don't like conceding the initiative at so early a stage as White, and so a slew of 'Anti Marshall' systems have been developed, in which White avoids the gambit and seeks a quieter life. Next, and crucial, is the early d4 system: 7 ...d6 (or 7 ... O-O 8 d4 d6 9 c3) 8 c3 O-O 9 d4, when Black's only real move is 9 ... i.g4!, putting immediate pressure on the d4-pawn. It used to be assumed that Black had full equality here, but White has recently been finding an edge in several lines. Finally, we come to the Closed Lopez, 7 ...d6 8 c3 O-O 9 h3. Even here Black has a broad range of options - whether to play ...c5, what to do with the c6-knight, and how to arrange his pieces and pawns defensively on the kingside. Marshall Attack

While l . .. e5 is a good move, many players grew tired of trying to neutralize White's ini tiative in the Ruy Lopez, and fortunately there are lots of other good options. The common feature amongst these lines is an attempt to inject some imbalance into the game. The first of these, the Sicilian, controls d4 directly - Black's idea is that when White plays d4, he will exchange and get an extra centre pawn. Of course there are risks here too, since l ...c5 does nothing to assist devel opment and is generally accompanied by fur ther non-developing moves. So he can go down to a vicious attack, but if he survives the early stages then his extra centre pawn should give him better long-term chances. Black can also try to prepare a quick ...d5 to equalize the central chances, as is seen in both the French ( l ...e6) and the Caro-Kann ( l ...c6). The e4-pawn can be directly attacked with either l ...d5 (the Scandinavian) or l .. .lt:Jf6 (the Alekhine), though both of these cost Black some time, in the former case by hav ing to recapture after 2 exd5, while the knight gets hit by 2 e5 in the latter. Finally, Black can leave the centre in White's hands altogether, preparing to attack with pawns later - this is the Pirc/Modem complex, started with l ...d6 or l ...g6. These are often viewed as different openings, the Pirc starting l . ..d6 2 d4 lt:Jf6 and the Modem l ...g6 2 d4 i..g7, though we shall look at them together, as the basic ideas are very similar. Sicilian l e4 c5 (D) w To think of the Sicilian as a defence is to make two errors. First, it is an attack, despite being played by Black - straight from the first move Black seeks to unbalance the po sition, and there are a higher proportion of decisive games here than in most other open ings. Second, the Sicilian isn't a single entity - it's a sprawling metropolis of variations marked as much by difference as by commu nity. My own modest library has over fifteen specialist volumes on the various branches of this opening, and many of these deal not with variations but sub-variations - Sapi and Schneider's The Sicilian Dragon: Yugoslav Attack 9 J..c4 deals only with the position af ter White's ninth move and still runs to over two hundred pages. While the above could be read as a warn ing against entering such theoretical waters, instead I'd prefer the reader to notice that there's something for everyone in the Sicilian due to its enormous depth and the richness and variety of Black's counterplay. It is also the forum for some of the best and most intri cate attacking chess played in modem tour naments. Dragon Set-up w Black has no structural weaknesses and all of his minor pieces are well placed. Once the f6-knight moves, the dark-squared bishop will breathe fire down the long diagonal, and can support a minority attack by the a- and b-pawns. Note that, as in all Sicilians, Black is always thinking about the . . .d5 break which, if it can't be met by e5 blocking out the bishop, could open the position and leave his pieces better placed.

Black has set up a wall of pawns which control his fourth rank. White will try to get in e5 or f5, while Black would love to play W ...d5 if he could do so without creating any weaknesses. A more common strategy is, through ...e5 and ... exf4, to create an e5 out- post for a black knight or bishop from where it can protect the kingside. Black's main chances lie on the queenside and particu- larly down the half-open c-file. Najdorf Set-up w Black has a backward d-pawn and a weak square on d5, though it is difficult for White to exploit either - the d-pawn is well guarded, while occupation of d5 often simply results in exchanges. All of White's necessary pawn play entails problems as well as prospects - a4 weakens the b4-square, while f4 1eaves the e-pawn vulnerable. Black will normally play ...b5 and ... .Bb7 to increase the pressure on e4, which can be further augmented with ... tt:Jbd7-c5 (an exchange sacrifice on c3, as indicated in a later diagram, is also com mon). A very tense game is in prospect. Maroczy Bind Set-up The structure in the following diagram arose from a Taimanov, but it can also come from Kan positions or Accelerated Dragons (where the pawn would be on e7 and the bishop on g7). Note how both Black' s natural breaks, ...b5 and ...d5, are restrained by the c4-pawn. White must remain attentive, since if Black manages one of these breaks he normally achieves equality at the least. Note again that the c6-knight would be happier on d7, from where it has a reasonable square on c5 and wouldn't block the b7-bishop or a c8-rook. c-File Black has a structural advantage in the Si cilian, namely an extra centre pawn. This also affords him a half-open c-file to work on, which is important in almost every Sicil ian line. An exchange sacrifice for a knight on c3 is very common, either to win the e4- pawn or to shatter the white queenside.

tt'lc3 g6 (D) w The Dragon Variation (so called because of the shape of the black pawn-structure) is one of the most easily comprehensible of Si cilians, and represents a truly critical test to the viability of 1 e4. Black seeks excellent and rapid development with no structural weakness (in fact, with his extra centre pawn, he holds an edge in this department), and if he succeeds his game will obviously be su perb. The logical nature of Black's formation should be enough to show that aggressive measures are required of White to secure an advantage, and this intuition has been borne out by practice - the most popular formation for White involves queenside castling with a kingside pawn-storm, coupled with exchang ing Black's fianchettoed bishop (which other wise performs sterling work both offensively and defensively). 6 i.e3 (D) 6 f4, Levenfish's idea, is tricky but rather innocuous. After 6 ... tt'lc6 (6 ... tt'lbd7 is solid and excellent; 6 ... i.g7 should probably be avoided though, since after 7 e5 !

B 7 .•. tt:Jc6 8 'i¥d2 O-O (D) w Black's threat is now 9 ...d5 ! , when his pieces will be better placed in the resulting open centre. White has three methods of dealing with this while advancing his own plans. 9 .tc4 Very, very dangerous. The move clearly stops ...d5, but also, and more subtly, pins the f7-pawn. The reason this is important is that after h4-h5xg6, Black often wants to keep the h-file closed with ...fxg6, but now this is im possible. However, it isn't all one-way traffic - the c4-bishop gives Black a target for his queenside counterplay.
9 O-O-O (D) is more solid - White allows

Complex stuff. Someone is getting mated, but theory hasn't quite decided who. Black will play ... lbc4 (possibly preceded by ...b5, so he can open the b-file after .ltxc4 bxc4) and try to attack on the queenside, while White has a choice of plans - positional play in the centre with .l:.hel and f4, or the vicious double pawn sacrifice g4 ! ? hxg4 h5 with a raging attack.

w 5 c4 5 lbc3 .ltg7 6 .lte3 lbf6 will very likely transpose to a normal Dragon, but Black has a few extra options. It should be noted that players who enjoy the Yugoslav Attack need to be very careful with their move-order here: 7 .ltc4 O-O 8 .ltb3 is a good idea (Black can still mix things up with 8 ... a5), but 7 f3? !

After 7 'ii xd4 .ltg7 8 i.g5 ! and drop ping the queen back to d2 or e3, White is more actively placed than in the main lines. 5 ... .lth6 ! ? is a more radical idea which has recently been played by Accelerated Dragon expert Sergei Tiviakov. Black raises the stakes - he trades White's good bishop, but at the cost of weakening his kingside defence and misplacing his knight. After 6 .ltxh6 lbxh6 7 lbc3 O-O 8 .lte2 Black has a few reasonable ways to play this virtually unexplored posi tion - .. .f6 and ... lbf7 is very solid, while a set-up with ...d6 and .. .f5 !? can be tried if he's feeling frisky. 6 .lte3 Keeping as many pieces on as possible with 6 lbc2 ! ? is an excellent alternative. 6 ..• lbf6 7 lbc3 O-O 7 ... lbg4 ! ? mixes things up a little: 8 'ilfxg4 lbxd4 9 'it'd 1 ! lbe6 ! and White still has good prospects, but at least Black's g7-bishop is happy. 8 i.e2 d6 9 O-O (D)

White whips up a menacing attack. For instance, after 10 ... l::t e8 1 1 f5, Black has to play 1 l .. .h6 ( 1 2 h4? ! d5 !) since the natural 1 l .. . .i.f8 loses: 12 g5 ti:Jfd7 1 3 tbxe6 ! ! fxe6 1 4 .i.h5 with an unstoppable at tack. 10 a4 Restraining Black's ...b5 is the most popu lar way to handle the position. Once the b pawn gets to this square, it's generally neces sary to spend a tempo on a3 anyway to prevent ... b4 (kicking a crucial defender of the e4- pawn), so this can hardly be seen as a waste of time.

The invention of Mark Taimanov. His original idea was that a black knight on f6 is often harassed by e4-e5, so why not put it on e7 from where it can go to c6 or g6? How ever, more often the line is used to transpose to Scheveningen-type positions. 5 ftJc3 5 lt:Jb5 is also well established, when after 5 ...d6 White can choose between a Maroczy Bind with 6 c4 or playing for an outpost with 6 .i.f4 ! ? e5 7 .i.e3 lt:Jf6 8 .i.g5 ! . 5 .. .'ilc7 5 ...a6 can lead to similar play, though White can also exchange on c6: 6 ftJxc6 bxc6 7 �d3 when he will castle and play f4, while Black should make use of his central pawns by striking with ...d5. Instead, standard moves such as 6 �e2 give Black a choice between reverting to .. :fie? lines or playing Taima nov's original interpretation with 6 ... ftJge7 !?. Although Taimanov hasn't found many sup porters for this approach, it still hasn't been refuted. 5 ...d6 is one of the best ways of reaching the Scheveningen, though even here many grandmasters have tried 6 g4 !?, leading to chaos. 6 �e3 This sharp option has recently become more popular. 6 �e2 is good, here as everywhere else in the Sicilian.

The very fact that this line doesn't lose on the spot is testimony to the complexity of w chess. Black hasn't touched a piece in his first four moves, plans to play 5 .. .'i/c7 and yet has a fully playable position. The merit of such a system is flexibility - Black gives away very little about his piece deployment, because he hasn't deployed any pieces ! I see the problems as twofold - chesswise, White also has a wide choice about how to position his forces (as compared to, say, the Svesh nikov), but on a practical note, Black' s set-up is rather subtle and requires accurate han dling in deciding when and where to get some pieces out. I thus wouldn't recommend this line to an inexperienced player, but for more advanced Sicilian exponents it can pro vide a welcome change. 5 c4 5 �d3 is also a good move, placing the bishop more actively than it would be on e2.

6 h3 is best met by 6 ...e6 and ...d5 (the

There are only a few situations in the Najdorf where 6 ...e5 isn't a good idea, and these gen erally occur when White has tried to seize control over d5 (with 6 �c4 or 6 �g5, for in stance). 6 �e3 does nothing to control d5 and so the move is safe.

Black can always trans pose back into Classical lines with ... lbc6 but he has some promising alternatives - early queenside play with ... b5, or bringing his queen's knight to the excellent c5-square. The line is still important but isn't played as often as, say, 6 J.e3 - it's ironic that Fischer himself severely dented 6 i.c4's reputation by winning a great game with Black in the system. 6 ...e6 Putting some granite on the a2-g8 diago nal is very worthwhile, since now the c4- bishop is in danger of becoming irrelevant. 6 ...e5?, on the other hand, can be rejected on sight - White has far too much control over the d5-square for the black position to be remotely respectable. 7 i.b3 A good prophylactic move - the bishop steps away from ...b5 and ...d5 advances, and White waits to see how Black will develop his pieces.

6 f4 is also a reasonable move, weakening
the e-pawn in return for an aggressive king side stance: Black can pick Dragon (6 ...g6) or Scheveningen (6 ...e6) formations, while a good way to keep matters strictly Najdorf is 6 ...e5 7 lLlf3 �bd7 followed by ... .te7 and

6 g3 is perhaps less effective here than
against other Sicilians, since after the reply 6 ...e5 the white e-pawn will restrict its own bishop. 6 .td3 may seem like a better square than e2, since the bishop defends the e-pawn and will attack the kingside after an e5 advance. However, the move has two defects - the d4- knight is no longer protected, and the bishop can be hit by a ... t:Lld7-c5 manoeuvre. This probably explains the move's unpopularity, and I think the best response is 6 ... t:Llc6 7 lLlxc6 bxc6 (a very favourable exchange for Black - the exchange of a pair of minor pieces renders White's space advantage less important, while the extra control over d5 and the half-open b-file is useful) 8 O-O e5 9 f4 .te7 10 a4 O-O and Black should have no real problems.

6 .te2 is simple and classical. On a scale of aggression, with .tg5 Open Sicilians be ing at one end and the c3 Sicilian at the other, this is somewhere near the middle.

I think White's best move is 4 d4 - while the bishop on b5 is misplaced, at least it's developed, and if White can't open the position then Black's temporal investment is likely to go unpunished.

w The French has been the trusted weapon of numerous GMs with a broad range of styles, from the strategically direct Botvinnik to the counterpunching Korchnoi to the classical Short, a fact that illustrates the different posi tions which the opening permits. White has three attempts for an advantage (as opposed to 3 exd5, which is an attempt for an early handshake): 1 ) The Advance Variation (3 e5) makes immediate spatial gains in the centre and on the kingside at the cost of fixing the white pawns and so making them more vulnerable to ...c5 and ... f6 breaks. 2) The Tarrasch (3 tbd2) is a more flexi ble line, which allows ... .tb4 to be met by c3 and so is the safest way of defending the cen tre. Black can hit e4 with 3 ... tbf6, d4 with 3 ...c5 or 3 ... tt:Jc6, or wait with 3 ... .te7. 3) The main continuation is 3 tbc3, which gives rise to the most complex and unbal anced lines in the French. It can be met either by the Winawer (3 ... .tb4) or the Classical (3 ... tbf6), both of which hit the e-pawn. The Classical gives White a choice between 4 e5 and 4 .tg5. Pawn-Chain The typical pawn-structure from the French is indicated here. White has more space, and a great deal depends on whether Black can destroy the white centre. Black has several options - attacking the chain with ...c5 is al most mandatory, after which he can attack the head with ... f6 if he wishes. Normally he exchanges pawns on d4 and then attacks d4 with as many pieces as possible, but he can also (after a3) play ...c4, a move which tar gets the queenside at the cost of giving White a free hand in the centre. Bad Bishop In most openings Black has a 'problem piece' , and in the French this i s undoubtedly his light-squared bishop (see diagram overleaf>. By committing his central pawns to light squares, Black impedes the mobility of this piece, and he must seek to improve or ex change it during the game. A common plan is ...b6 and ... .ta6 (or sometimes the similar idea ... 'i'b6 and ... .td7-b5), whereby the bishop tries to exchange itself for its white counterpart. Another idea is to hit the centre with ...f6 and try ... .td7-e8-g6/h5 . Finally,
88 UNDERSTANDING THE CHESS OPENINGS
Black can exchange the white pawn before it gets to e5, and then manoeuvre his bishop to the long diagonal ( ...b6 and ... i.b7, or ... i.d7-c6). All of these ideas are positionally sound, but the problem is that they take time to implement. Judging when to improve the light-squared bishop and when to devote time to other projects instead is one of the marks of a good French player. Exchange French

a line which is dull and solid despite being a favourite of the young Fischer (it can also be reached via a Sicilian move-order: 1 e4 c5 2 lbf3 e6 3 d3 d5 4 lbbd2).

De spite a few outings by Kasparov as a sur prise weapon, the Exchange Variation is really nothing more than a tacit draw offer and Black should be constantly on the look out for ways to unbalance the position. 4 lbf3 w
4 c4 lbf6 5 lbc3 i.b4 is a more interesting
alternative, when White will probably end up with an isolated queen's pawn but active pieces. 4 ... tt:Jf6 The symmetrical response leaves White with very little, but if Black wants to play for a win he might want to take more risk: 4 ... i.g4 is more provocative - 5 h3 i.h5 6 'ili'e2+ ! 'ife7 7 i.e3 lbc6 8 lbc3 O-O-O 9 g4 ! i.g6 1 0 O-O-O leaves White slightly more ac tive. 4 ... i.d6 5 c4 ! is an improved version of the

This is perhaps the most critical response to the French, though Black has found sev eral routes to full counterplay.

White takes away the ... l2Jh4 option in a rather crude fashion. Meanwhile, the pawn threatens to advance to h5 and (if allowed) h6, trying to weaken the black kingside. 10 •.. h5 Stopping any advance of the h- and g pawns in a single move is a pretty good deal, and in practice this has been played quite ex clusively. However, White now has a useful square on g5 to work with. 11 .td3 This is the only way to make sense of the position - the kingside pawns can't advance, and any development of the queen's knight will lose the d-pawn. Hence White plans .txf5 and l2Jc3, putting pressure on the d pawn, and planning queenside pressure with l2Ja4 and :c 1 . ll. . .a5! Black has to generate queenside counter play, and this is the way to do it - the unde fended bishop on b2 allows some tactical tricks. as will be seen on move 14. Had the knight retreated, White would have played 1 5 a4 with an overwhelming space advantage all over the board, but this accu rate move holds the balance. The b5-pawn is now doomed, but this isn't the end of the story. After 15 'ifd3 l2Ja7 1 6 O-O �c8, White can generate considerable compensation with 17 .te l ! l:!c4 1 8 l2Je2 'i'xb5 19 .tg5 ! fol lowed by lLlf4 and play on the b- and c-files. A complete examination of this position is somewhat beyond the scope of this book, but my personal preference is for White, since Black has several weaknesses, a major prob lem with his h8-rook and his extra pawn has a lot of work to do before threatening to queen.

Introduced by Siegbert Tarrasch in 1 890, this conservative knight move is the posi tionally soundest way of meeting the French.

Interestingly, Tarrasch himself turned against the variation when he saw that Black could obtain an

The idea is to wait and see what White's next developing move is before playing ...c5 or ... ltJf6. 3 ... tt:Jc6 is an offbeat try, with the disad vantage that Black makes ...c5 more difficult to arrange.

Well, a certain creative licence is available in most openings, but that doesn't mean it should be exercised. Black's game is playable but inferior to the main lines; for instance, 4 ltJgf3 ltJf6 5 e5 ltJfd7 and he is almost a full tempo down on the 3 . . . ltJf6 line. 4 exd5 This is the most popular move (it also arises after 4 ltJgf3 and 5 exd5) - White no tices that Black's natural recapture (with the pawn) will leave him with an IQP after an eventual dxc5, while recapturing with the queen runs into �c4. 4 . . • 'iVxd5 4 ...exd5 is a very sound alternative.

These early . . .dxe4 systems have been gaining popularity in the French (especially since they can also be reached via a Tarrasch move-order). Basically, Black concedes an opening advantage to White (who has more space and a small lead in development) in ex change for a very solid position.

w In this defence Black wishes to establish a This structure arises very often in the Caro-Kann when Black exchanges pawns on e4 and then plays ...c5, exchanging the white d-pawn (it also comes up in the Rubinstein French). The black pawn-structure is basically better - he has an extra centre pawn which can either advance or stay back to defend his king. In exchange for this, White normally has more active pieces. The point is that White is compelled to play actively in these posi tions, since if Black is given time to catch up in development and piece activity his struc ture should provide him with an edge.

Open Centre 4 c4 This, the Panov-Botvinnik Attack, is my usual choice when confronted with the Caro, though its modern popularity lags behind both 3 lbc3 and 3 e5. White's idea is to take on an isolated queen's pawn in exchange for sub stantial activity, and direct transpositions to positions from the Nimzo-lndian and Queen's Gambit Accepted are not hard to find.

This variation achieved some popularity after it was used by Tal against Botvinnik, but older theory suggested that Black should have no problems after this advance since (compared to the French) he could still de velop his bishop with ... .tf5 and ...e6 before striking at the centre with ...c5.

He can delay with moves like ... li:Jd7 and ... lt:Je7, but at some point he must strike at the white cen tre, and I think it's a good idea to do this im mediately. GM Nigel Short pioneered 4 c3 e6 5 .te2 c5 6 li:Jf3 li:Jc6 7 O-O, with reasonable chances for an advantage; for instance, 7 ...h6 (7 ...cxd4 8 cxd4 lt:Jge7 9 a3 .te4 10 li:Jbd2 li:Jf5 1 1 b4 is also better for White, since the d-pawn is too hot to handle) 8 .te3 ! cxd4 9 cxd4 lt:Jge7 I 0 li:Jc3 when the f5-bishop is taking a good square away from the knight. 4 .i.e3 is another idea which has been used by Kasparov and Svidler - after 4 ...

In addition, the fl -bishop can be devel- oped on a more active square than e2.

w Provoking White to expand, with the idea that once he does, his centre will be vulnera ble to attack. The modern treatment for White is to expand a little bit, then consoli date. I have to be a little careful in my com ments on this, since my compatriot GM Alex Baburin has played it for his whole life, and certainly used it to rough me up on more than one occasion. Indeed, it's possible to be too dogmatic about the line - I remember GM Nigel Short being absolutely contemptuous about it in the early 1 990s, then telling Alex "Of course it's not that bad, but you should really graduate to the French !", and finally using it to draw from a position of strength, as Black, against Kasparov ! So this stuff is playable. One final note: Alex told me that he started playing the line because, as a 1 e4 player, it was the only defence he knew absolutely nothing about! Of course it's possible to take this approach to extremes ( 1 e4 g5 and so on), but at least you're guaranteed to expand your knowledge. 2 e5 This has to be right. 2 tt'lc3 is a nothing move.

w This opening has always had some high level support - Larsen used it a lot, while Ian Rogers was also a fan. It has gradually been gaining respectability - Anand even used it against Kasparov in their 1 995 match. While there can be no doubt about the opening's playability, it seems unlikely to become as popular as the main defences to 1 e4 since White has a relatively easy time getting an edge. 2 ex d5 2 liJc3 is possible, but allows Black to seize some useful central space after 2 ...d4 3 ltJce2 e5 when White will follow up with d3, f4 and tiJf3 to try to dismantle the imposing black structure. 2 e5? gives Black a favour able version of the Advance variations of the French and Caro-Kann, since he can play his pawn to c5 in one go while his light-squared bishop isn't blocked in by the pawn-chain. 2 ••• 'i!V x d5 Black is ahead in development for an in stant, but he'll lose time with the queen. 2 ... tiJf6 is also possible, when 3 d4 (after 3 c4, 3 ...c6 4 d4 cxd5 5 liJc3 transposes to the Panov-Botvinnik Attack, while 3 ...e6 is the dubious but dangerous Icelandic Gambit) 3 ... ttJxd5 (3 ...�g4 ! ? is a worthwhile alterna tive - White can bail out by 4 �e2 or 4 tiJf3 with an edge, or get embroiled in the crazi ness of 4 f3 �f5 5 c4 e6 6 dxe6 liJc6 !, when Black' s lead in development seems to com pensate fully for the pawns) 4 c4 tiJb6 gives similar play to the Alekhine. 3 liJc3 This is by far the most popular move, but it does take away the option of c4, which means that Black can set up a formation with ... c6 and ...e6 that is difficult to break.

It's important to un derstand that the absence of queens doesn't mean that White needn't worry about king safety - while he isn't so likely to be mated, his king can be harassed with gain of time (see Black's 7th move) which will make full development very difficult. 3 tiJf3 also leaves the c-pawn free, but Black can develop quite quickly since he no longer has to waste time moving his queen.

'i!Va5 This looks like a silly square at first, but given that White will be moving his d-pawn at some point, it's useful to set up a pin on the c3-knight. The queen also has options of dropping back to b6 to hit the b-pawn, while returning to d8 (after . . .c6) is also possible.

Ripeness tends to be a difficult quality to identify, which means that Pirc positions re quire a certain degree of skill to handle - if Black waits too long before committing his central pawns then he can be crushed. Although there are some subtle differences between the Pirc and the Modem, we shall discuss them together, since the basic ideas are the same, and so are White's main sys tems against these openings. There are two sections here that deal with lines that are spe cific to one or the other (the Pribyl Pirc and the Gurgenidze Modem), but bear in mind that the detailed theory of the main lines is af fected by Black's precise move-order.

Known as the 1 50 Attack from the British circuit (apparently because 'even a 1 50-rated player could handle the white side' - my apologies to any 1 50s out there), this varia tion has exploded in popularity at all levels and even been given Kasparov's seal of ap proval. White's plan has everything - aggres sion (sometimes he castles queenside and throws some kingside pawns forward), solid ity (sometimes he doesn't!), and simplicity ('ifld2 and .lth6 will exchange the star black bishop). 4 .ltg5 ! ? is a slight twist - White still has the plan of 'i'd2 and .lth6, but in the mean time his bishop exerts more influence.

The only rule worth re membering in this context is that pawns should always serve pieces, not vice versa - an isolated or doubled pawn may generally demand more defence than its colleagues, but be sure to check whether a structure is ac tually weak before rejecting it.

Hii A Section 3: Queen's Gambit
1 d4 d5 2 c4! (D)
The Queen's Gambit is the only attempt for an advantage after 1 d4 d5 . As we will later see, the opening isn't really a gambit at all, since Black can't hold on to the c4- pawn, but the extra pressure exerted on the black d-pawn is immediately uncomfort able. If White had continued 2 lbc3, then 2 .. . lbf6 ! would leave him with no way of generating play in the centre - the e4-square is covered.
B
The threat is 3 cxd5, when Black has no convenient recapture - for instance, 2 ... tiJf6? 3 cxd5 lbxd5 4 e4 ! and White dominates the centre. So Black must do something about it. First we'll examine the most natural re sponse to any gambit, namely chopping off the pawn - the Queen's Gambit Accepted (QGA) starts with 2 . .. dxc4. Then we'll look at the thoroughly logical and rock-solid 2 ... e6, known as the Queen's Gambit Declined or QGD. Players who grew tired of ceding the cen tre with the QGA or blocking in the queen's bishop with ... e6 soon looked to other meth ods of central support, and 2 .. . c6 (the Slav Defence) was the fruit of their efforts. Finally we'll analyse more radical coun terattacking methods, such as the Chigorin Defence (2 . .. lbc6) and the Albin Counter- Gambit (2 ...e5). Light-Squared Bishop Throughout the material, I'd like you to keep an eye on Black's light-squared bishop, which is handled differently in all of the set ups. In the Slav, Black delays ... e6 until he can develop this bishop outside the pawn chain. In the QGA, he exchanges on c4 and then, with ...a6, ...b5 and ... i.b7, occupies the long diagonal (a similar plan is seen in the Semi-Slav). In the QGD, the bishop is clearly a problem for Black, and his best way to try to solve it is to play ...b6 and ... i.b7. Queen's Ga mbit Accepted

w "You know, everyone says 'Of course, Black doesn't want to hold on to this pawn' , but I'll tell you a secret: he really does ! It's just that normally he isn't allowed to !" So GM Alex Baburin explained the secret of his favourite opening to me. The first point to understand is that White can get the pawn back - for instance, after 3 lbf3 lbf6 4 e3 b5?! 5 a4 c6 6 axb5 cxb5 7 b3 he regains the material immediately. So why would Black give up his central stronghold? The reason is well explained (albeit in rela tion to a different position) by Emanuel Las ker in one of his London lectures, repro duced in the classic Common Sense in Chess: "When you are conscious not to have violated [opening principles], you should accept the sacrifice of an important pawn, such as the e-, d-, c- or f-pawn. If you do not, as a rule, the pawn which you have rejected will become very troublesome to you. Do not accept the sacrifice, however, with the idea of maintain ing your material advantage at the expense of development. Such a policy never pays in the end. By far the better plan is to give up the pawn after your opponent has made some exertions to gain it. By the same process, through which your opponent has achieved greater scope for his pieces, you will then al ways be able to recoup yourself, and, as a rule, be a gainer in the bargain." Thus Black hopes that the time spent by White in regaining the pawn will be enough to allow a smooth de velopment of the black minor pieces. 3 e4
1 d4 d5 2 c4 dx c4 3 e4 (D)

GM Chris Ward summarised matters nicely when he wrote "If the QGA is to be refuted, then 3 e4 is probably the place for White to look." Another way of stating matters is that
3 e4 is the critical test of the QGA. Given that
this 'critical' notion has been repeatedly used throughout the book, it's probably worth ad dressing two issues at this point: 1 ) How can we tell that a move is critical? 2) Are there any reasons for not playing a critical move? There are several ways to answer 1, but I'd say that the main quality of a critical move/variation is ambition. Critical moves
118 UNDERSTANDING THE CHESS OPENINGS
make big positional demands, and so if the opponent doesn't respond vigorously then he can easily end up in a prospectless situation. Merely looking at the position after 2 ...dxc4 is enough to see that 3 e4 must be the critical move - White claims a central monopoly, maximum space, and prepares to capture the c-pawn. Question 2 is slightly trickier. The main reason not to play critical lines is that the al ternatives tend to be safer. In this context, I find a remark by GM Jon Speelman about GM Bent Larsen quite instructive: "I see Lar sen as above all a master of provocation: of the destabilization of the opponent's position - both on the board and in his head - through an intense positional assault, often carried out, particularly as Black, in the face of extremely dangerous tactical (counter)play. Larsen, through his outrageous positional de mands, forces the opponent to punish him tactically for his strategic presumptuousness: unless the opponent is totally ruthless and ac curate - for false action is at least as damag ing as passivity - Larsen will triumph." 3 ••• lbf6 (D) 3 ...e5 is one of the most logical responses - capturing on e5 leaves White with a useless endgame, so he normally proceeds 4 lbf3, when 4 ... exd4 ( 4 ... .tb4+ 5 lbc3 exd4 6 lbxd4 also gives White an edge) 5 .txc4 lbc6 6 O-O .te6 7 .txe6 fxe6 8 'iYb3 regains the pawn with a slight advantage, since 8 ...

w The Queen's Gambit Declined has some thing for everyone. For the bores amongst you, consider trying the Orthodox and Las ker Defences - you may lose some games through overly passive play, but in others you'll manage to exchange enough pieces to draw. The Tartakower and Cambridge Springs Defences are more interesting and complex, while Black can try a Tarrasch formation if he's prepared to weaken his structure for some play. Black isn't the only one with some choice - White can try a .i.f4 or .ll. xf6 system to vary the play, go into the Exchange Variation with cxd5, or fianchetto in a Catalan. In short, even in this one branch of the Queen's Gam bit, there's enough variety and potential for great chess to satisfy anyone. Carlsbad Structure The 'Carlsbad' structure (see following dia gram) often arises in the Queen's Gambit, es pecially in the Exchange Variation. In pure structural terms, the pawns are placed excep tionally favourably from White's point of view, since he has an extra centre pawn and can launch a minority attack as illustrated, while Black can hardly launch a similar attack by ...f5-f4 since he would expose his own king too much. This means that Black should aim for active piece-play on the kingside, through which he can hold the balance. Orthodox & Lasker

Black's intention in this line is to delay capturing on c4 until White has developed his bishop, thereby gaining a tempo. This explains why White's main move is �c l . Note also that Black retains the possibility of ... lbe4, but it's more common to exchange a pair of knights via .... dxc4 and ... lbd5 . 6 ...h6 7 .lth4 lbe4, the Lasker Variation, is a closely related system. This is an unashamed attempt at a draw. Black aims for a position which, though undoubtedly better for White, he hopes to be tenable. Such openings have largely fallen out of fashion these days, espe cially since the predominance of open tour naments means that wins with Black against weaker players are often essential, so players have been forced to learn interesting lines which offer more dynamic chances. 8 i..xe7 'ii xe7 9 �c 1 (keeping the tension is one good option; 9 cxd5 lbxc3 10 bxc3 exd5 is also possible however; after 1 1 'i!Vb3 :d8 12 c4 dxc4 1 3 i..xc4 lbc6 14 i¥c3 White holds the advantage) 9 . ..c6 10 i..d3 lbxc3 1 1 �xc3 dxc4 12 i..xc4 lbd7 1 3 O-O. This position is uncomfortable for Black. His natural break is 13 ... e5, but Karpov has demonstrated that 14 i..b3 exd4 1 5 exd4 ! is then good for White, who can generate an initiative on the e-file and the kingside while Black needs a few moves to involve his queenside pieces in the game. w 7 �cl If White wants a more interesting game (and he probably should), he can take a look at 7 'ifc2 ! ?. The weakening of d4 makes 7 ...c5 a good move, but after 8 O-O-O ! (the same move can be played against 7 ...c6) Black has been tricked into playing a position which doesn't put both players into an imme diate coma. 7 ... c6 7 ...a6 tries to work in themes from the QGA by planning ...dxc4, ...b5 and ... i..b7, but White can cut across these ideas by 8 c5 ! with a large queenside advantage. 8 i..d3 This has developed a considerable body of theory, but there's no denying that White has just lost the battle for tempi. 8 'flc2 would be my preference - White can mess around with semi-useful moves like a3 and h3 if Black doesn't capture on c4, but there are also more interesting possibilities like 8 ... lbh5 (he can't come to e4 any more) 9 i..xe7 'flxe7 10 g4 !? lbhf6 1 1 g5 and 1 2 h4 with a kingside initiative.

O-O 6 tiJ f3 h 67 i..h4 b6 (D) w Now this is actually quite a good opening. Rather than aim for piece exchanges, Black wants to play some proper chess: he aims to solve the problem of his poor bishop by put ting it on the long diagonal. Note also that the b6-pawn prepares a ...c5 advance, since dxc5 can be met by the centralizing ...bxc5 ! . White has three ways to deal with this sys tem. He can take on d5 immediately [Option 1 ]; he can wait for the bishop to commit itself to b7 and then close the diagonal by taking on f6 and d5 [Option 2]; or he can keep the ten sion [Option 3]. 8 i..e2 Starting the main manifestation of Option 2, for which 8 l:tc 1 is also a good preparation. 8 cxd5 tbxd5 (8 ...exd5 9 i..d3 i..b7 10 tbe5 ! followed by f4 and a march of the g pawn gives White good chances against the weakened black kingside) 9 i..xe7 "fixe7 10 tbxd5 exd5 1 1 l:!c 1 (D) is the starting posi tion of White's first approach.
B
Now Black plays l l .. .i..e6 ! . 'But what about the long diagonal?' Well, it isn't long any more. The d5-pawn will remain fixed there for a long time, and since Black plans to play ...c5 (and meet dxc5 with ...bxc5) he doesn't want his bishop on b7 blocking play down the b-file. This doesn't mean that Black's seventh move was a mistake, since it still helps prepare ...c5 and has provoked White into a cxd5 exchange which he is nor mally reluctant to make. One of the secrets to a proper understanding of the Tartakower is the realization that the proper place for the black bishop is e6 - it's just that in most lines he can't place it there because the square is occupied by a pawn. Now after 12 'ifa4 c5 1 3 'ifa3 l:!c8 Black will follow up with either 14 ... �f8 or 14 ... 'ifb7, respectively protecting and activating the queen, with good pros pects. 8 i..d3, while White can still take on d5, is normally a preface to keeping the tension: 8 ... i..b7 9 O-O tbbd7 10 'i'e2 c5 and we have Option 3 in all its glory. Black will probably end up with an isolated queen's pawn or a set of hanging pawns, and as GM Nigel Short says, Black is looking to equalize here. Still, at least his pieces can move to proper squares, which is more than can be said of a lot of QGD variations when the biggest ambition of the black army is to be put back in the box.

J. b7 Black can try a very different approach with 8 ...dxc4 9 J.xc4 J.b7, a plan whose benefits and burdens can be seen at a glance Black keeps the long diagonal open for his light-squared bishop, but exchanges off an important pawn and so gives White a shot at playing e4 while leaving him with an extra centre pawn.

The opening had two real boosts - the first when Boris Spassky used it successfully, the second when Garry Kasparov adopted it dur ing his rampage through the Candidates se ries - indeed, it was only when Karpov's technique in the World Championship proved too much that he turned to other defences. I don't know if the opening will ever be as popular again, but it is certainly playable. 4 cx d5 By far the most popular and critical option, effectively isolating the black d-pawn at the cost of allowing his light-squared bishop into the game.

w In the preceding sections we saw the diffi culty Black often has with his queen's bishop after ...e6. The Slav is an attempt to avoid these difficulties, while still holding the cen tre.

1 d4 dS 2 c4 c6 3 l2lf3
This is the safest way to the main line - White develops his knight without creating any targets. 3 l2lc3 leads to a different type of game after 3 ...dxc4 (3 ... t2lf6 can go back into the main variations but see also the section 'Early e3' ) 4 e4 b5 5 a4 b4 6 l2la2 l2lf6 7 f3 e5 8 dxe5 'i!ixd I + 9 �xd 1 l2lfd7 10 e6 fxe6 1 1 ..txc4, when White has the better structure but his king is tender. 3 •.. l2lf6 The most flexible move. Both 3 ... dxc4 and 3 ... ..tf5 are undesirable: 3 ...dxc4 4 e3 b5 5 a4 and after b3, White will regain his pawn with the advantage, as Black has prematurely opened up the queenside and holds no central influence; 3 ... ..tf5 doesn't lose a pawn, but after 4 cxd5 cxd5 5 ii'b3 'ii/ c7 6 l2lc3 e6 7 ..tf4! White holds the advan tage, since the bishop is invulnerable due to the weakness of b7. 4 l2lc3 (D)
B
4 ...dx c4! (D) Black has a couple of other respectable op tions here, but if he wishes to play his bishop to f5 then this is the most accurate. 4 ... ..tf5? is a definite mistake: 5 cxd5 cxd5 6 �b3 ! and Black is in trouble since 6 .. .'i/c7 loses a pawn to 7 l2lxd5, and Sadler gives 6 ... b6 7 e4 dxe4 8 l2le5 e6 9 ..tb5+ l2lfd7 10 g4 ..tg6 1 1 h4 ! (threatening h5, trapping the bishop) as too good for White. 4 ...g6 is a form of the Schlechter Slav (if the Grtinfeld and the Slav ever have a child, it'll probably look like this). But as with many hybrid systems it takes the deficiencies of both without time to implement the strengths - it's a bad Slav because the light-squared bishop won't be comfy on the kingside with that g6-pawn in the way, while as a Grtinfeld it falls short because the c-pawn is meant to
SLAV 133
attack the centre, not defend it. After a simple continuation like 5 .tf4 .tg7 6 e3 O-O 7 l:tc l White is comfortably better. Normally Black only opts for the Schlechter set-up if White has already played e3. 4 ...a6 is an important alternative, and is discussed in its own section below. 4 ...e6 is the Semi-Slav - see the next chap ter. w 5 a4 This is the only safe way to regain the pawn that also poses Black any problems. The difficulty with 5 e3 can be seen after 5 ...b5 6 a4 b4 ! . The attack on the c3-knight gives Black time to stabilize his queenside. After 7 li:Ja2 (7 li:Jbl .ta6 is fine for Black) 7 ... a5 8 .txc4 White has no advantage in view of his terribly placed knight on a2.
5 e4 is the Slav Gambit. The theme of sac
rificing the c4-pawn arises in several Slav positions, but this is one of the more comfort able for Black. One of the main problems is that, after ...b5, the fl -bishop will be locked out of play by the c4-pawn. 5 ...b5 (no prizes for any other moves; if White is allowed to recapture on c4 with his pawn standing proudly on e4, he will stand better) 6 e5 (6 ...b4 was threatened, so this move is virtu ally always played) 6 ... li:Jd5 7 a4 e6 (Black's most solid response, and theory's favourite) 8 axb5 li:Jxc3 9 bxc3 cxb5 10 li:Jg5 .tb7 and Black is better - he still holds his extra pawn, is not behind in development and has a very dangerous queenside majority. s ... .trs 5 ... li:Ja6 is Smyslov's variation, a very solid and logical option. The b4-square is an out post for a black knight, so it is immediately targeted. After 6 e4 .tg4 7 .txc4 e6 White is a little better in view of his central space, but Black has very comfortable development. 5 ... .tg4 was popularized by Bronstein. Very sharp play arises after 6 li:Je5 .th5 and now 7 f3 (planning e4 with a very strong cen tre) or 7 h3 (planning g4). 6 tbe5 This is the modem move.
6 e3 is safer but a little tame - after 6 ...e6 7
.txc4 .tb4 8 O-O O-O 9 'ilfe2 .tg6 I don't see why Black should be worse. 6 ...e6 This commits Black to an exciting piece sacrifice. 6 ... li:Jbd7 is the main alternative and the most popular line these days. It is examined in the next section.
7 f3 (D)
B
This was the whole point of 6 li:Je5 - White wants to build an imposing centre with gain of time after e4. If Black simply allows this then he will stand much worse, so drastic ac tion is called for.

5 e3 is a logical move. After an immediate
s ... �f5 or 5 ...�g4, 6 'ii' b3 ! is unpleasant, so generally Black proceeds 5 ...b5 6 b3 (6 cxd5 has been played by some good guys includ ing Karpov, but I don't believe it - the black queenside isn't too weak and the c 1 -bishop is normally outside the pawn-chain in Exchange Slav structures) 6 ...�g4 7 �e2 lt:Jbd7, when Black is very solid. The latest trend has been
8 h3 �xf3 9 gxf3 ! ?, aiming for a bind with f4
and c5.
5 a4 makes ... b5 more difficult for Black. I
think he is best advised to adopt a QGD set up with 5 ... e6, and after 6 �g5, Bacrot's 6 ... a5 ! 7 e3 �e7 plans .. .'�Ja6-b4, with a com fortable position.
5 g3 is an idea borrowed from the Catalan
- White sacrifices his c4-pawn to open the long diagonal for his light-squared bishop and gain the centre. Black can accept the gambit, while declining with 5 ...�f5 6 �g2 e6 7 O-O h6 leaves him with few complaints. 5 cxd5 cxd5 transposes to the Exchange Slav, though with Black committed to an ... a6 formation. 5 •.• lbbd7 5 ... �f5 6 'iYb3 'iYc8 is also very sound. 6 �f4 lbh5! (D) 6 ...g6 7 h3 �g7 8 e3 O-O is also very sensi ble. Hitting the f4-bishop makes possible both .. .'ifc7 and, more radically, ...e5. Here is a w good example of Black' s chances, with Kas parov wielding the black bits: 7 �g5 (D) After 7 e3 Black isn't compelled to take, but it looks like a pretty good idea: 7 ... lbxf4 8 exf4 't!Vc7 9 'ii d2 g6 10 �d3 �h6 1 1 g3 f6 1 2 'ii' e2 b 6 with good pressure. 7 �d2 g6 8 e4 dxe4 9 lbxe4 lbdf6 ! and, while the position is balanced, I think White needs to play very precisely to avoid being worse (if need be, the h5-knight can go to g7 and e6). 7 �e3 'ilc7 8 g3 e5 looks fine for Black.
7 g3 is a relatively new idea, employed to
great effect (against me !) in the 2004 Calvia Olympiad. I think Black should strike on the queenside with 7 ...b6 8 cxb6 lt:Jxb6 with bal anced chances.

w After my lengthy justifications for the Slav and not blocking one's bishop in, the reader can be forgiven for thinking this move gives Black the worst of both worlds - his c8- bishop has no prospects while his c-pawn stands passively at c6 instead of attacking the centre from c5. In fact Black has a creative idea to activate the bishop and cunningly use his c6-pawn, as you will see from the main lines given below. I think the best way of understanding the Semi-Slav, however, is as a tactical threat against c4 (Black intends 5 ...dxc4 6 e3 b5 7 a4 i.b4!, hanging on to his pawn). If you look at the position for a moment it becomes clear that White has no convenient way to deal with this threat - exchanging with 5 cxd5 exd5 ! transposes into a harmless variation of the QGD Exchange Variation, advancing with

b6, while defending with 5 b3 allows ... J.b4, ... lt:Je4 and .. .'iVa5, hopping on the dark squares. In fact White has two main tries: 5 i.g5 is the most aggressive line in the whole Queen's Gambit - White intends to meet 5 ...dxc4 with
6 e4 ! , threatening e5 . This line is hugely
complex and will be considered next. 5 e3, generally leading to the Meran Variation, is an equally well regarded line - White blocks in his c 1 -bishop, but comfortably defends the pawn. He plans i.d3 and e4. 5 i..gS

White gains space on the kingside (7 ... liJxg4 is very double edged: after 8 :g 1 the white rook will break through to g7) and leaves Black with a choice of ways to defend against the threatened 8 g5 - 7 ... i..b4 is very logical, preparing the e4- square for his knight (White answers 8 i..d2), while 7 ...dxc4 is sharper, opening the d5- square and with it the whole position.

w This can't really be called a Semi-Slav, though it has obvious similarities. Obviously 4 tbf3 tbf6 would directly transpose into that opening, though both sides have alternatives. One of the main reasons Black plays this move-order is to avoid the Exchange Slav which, as has been seen, is a very boring opening. If White now captures on d5 then Black recaptures with the e-pawn, maintain ing some imbalance and (more importantly) equalizing immediately: 4 cxd5 exd5 5 tbf3 tbf6 6 .tg5 .te7 7 'i'c2 (or else ... .tf5 is played) 7 ... g6 ! with equal chances, as shown in the Exchange QGD section. 4 e4!

While this isn't really a Queen's Gambit, I had to stick the Blackmar-Diemer Gambit in somewhere. I've seen more promising play ers lured into incompetence by this opening than I care to remember. The basic pattern is this - player learns BDG, tries to get it in ev ery game, thus limiting his chess experience (and, since the opening isn't good, he loses too many games, meaning that his rating stays low and he can't get games against better players). Nobody wh o plays good ch ess plays th is line, and nobody wh o plays good ch ess ever will. 2 • . . dx e4 3 tbc3 tbf6 3 ...e5 equalizes straight away. 4 f3 This is the point of the opening, and is nec essary for White to complete his develop ment. He hopes that the half-open e- and f-files will provide promising avenues of play against the black position, but it seems that these hopes are over-optimistic. The black e- isn't too far behind in development. One of the flaws of White's concept is that he is rely ing exclusively on piece-play without pawn breaks, and this makes his life much harder. 4 ••• ex f3 4 . . . e3 is a concept known from similar po sitions - by returning the pawn Black hopes to make the white development look silly (in particular, the position of the f3-pawn makes no sense). This is fully sufficient to equalize, but I still feel it constitutes a let-off for White, who is struggling to hold the balance in the main lines. 5 tbx f3 Now Black has a choice of several good set-ups. 5 .••�g4 5 ...e6 6 �g5 �e7 looks pretty solid too. 5 ...g6 6 �c4 �g7 7 O-O O-O is fully play- able, though to a certain extent White's open ing is vindicated since Black can't block the c4-bishop with ...e6. 6 �c4 e67 O-O c6 (D) .i. w and f-pawns, one of which is an extra pawn, And after ... �e7, ... tbbd7, and . ..O-O, where perform an excellent defensive job and Black did the pawn go?

Much like the move away from the sym metrical I e4 e5, Black found alternatives to the sometimes tedious defence against the Queen' s Gambit. Most of these start I d4 lLlf6 2 c4, and now: 1 ) Black can try to prevent e4, but without resorting to ...d5 . This can be achieved by 2 ... e6 3 lLlc3 i..b4 (the Nimzo-Indian De fence), which is accompanied by (after 3 tLlf3) the Queen's Indian Defence (3 ...b6) and the Bogo-Indian Defence (3 ... i..b4+). 2) Black can allow e4 and try to play against the centre. This philosophy is at the heart of two defences after 2 ...g6 3 lLlc3, the King's Indian (3 ... i..g7) and the Griinfeld (3 ...d5). 3) Black can hit the centre with 2 ... c5. Af ter 3 d5 he has two main options, the Benko Gambit (3 ...b5 ! ?) and the Modem Benoni (beginning with 3 . . .e6). Black can also frustrate e4 in a more radi cal fashion with l .. .f5, the Dutch Defence. N i mzo- l ndian
1 d4 tbf6 2 c4 e6 3 tbc3 .tb4 (D)
w In view of White's intended 4 e4, occupy ing the centre completely, for generations the only acceptable move for Black was 3 ...d5 . Then Aron Nimzowitsch demonstrated that the e4-square could be indirectly controlled by this developing bishop move, and thus was born the most durable and popular of the closed defences, the Nimzo-Indian. The e4- square is of crucial importance to both sides in this opening, and Black often must 'con cede the minor exchange' (give up a bishop for a knight) to maintain level chances in an unbalanced position. The comments of GM Bent Larsen, the most faithful of Nimzowitsch's disciples and a lifelong adherent of the Nimzo-Indian, should be instructive for anyone trying to de cide which defence to select against 1 d4: "If Black is not to leave the initiative to White during the first part of the game, he must take a certain risk. He may sacrifice a pawn (like the Volga or Benko Gambit 1 d4 tbf6 2 c4 c5
3 d5 b5 !? 4 cxb5 a6) or accept a pawn weak
ness; for instance, the isolated d-pawn in the Tarrasch Defence 1 d4 d5 2 c4 e6 3 tbc3 c5 !? 4 cxd5 exd5. The lack of space on one side of the board which Black accepts in, for in stance, many variations of the King' s Indian may also be considered such a risk, and in many openings Black gives up the bishop pair. If I have a choice between these possi bilities, I rather prefer the latter, while I want very good compensation for taking on an iso lated pawn !" One point which must be made is that the Nimzo-Indian has the capacity to walk all over passive play from White. White simply must try to open the position for his two bish ops and put pressure on Black, since other wise he will find himself in a horrible bind. The most straightforward attempt is 4 a3, the Samisch variation, which forces Black to part with his dark-squared bishop. After 4 ... .txc3+ 5 bxc3, White aims to build an im posing centre with e4 while Black will play on the queenside. The Rubinstein variation, 4 e3, prepares rapid development (normally with .td3, tbf3 and O-O), after which White will return to his plan of playing for e4. The Leningrad variation, 4 .tg5, isn't too popular at GM level these days but is still very dangerous for the unprepared player. Kasparov patronized 4 tbf3 in a couple of world championship matches against Karpov - such endorsements generally bode well for the popularity of a variation, and this line has developed a substantial body of theory. Our final section concerns the Classical variation, 4 'i!Vc2, which has recently been more popular than all of White's other op tions combined. White intends to continue 5 a3 .txc3+ 6 'iWxc3, gaining the bishop-pair without compromising his pawn-structure. The drawback is obviously a substantial time investment - the queen on c3 is also subject to harassment. Accordingly play gets sharp, critical and messy. ill A At A
AQ
The Isolated Queen's Pawn A very common structure arising from the Nimzo-Indian is the Isolated Queen's Pawn (IQP for short). Other examples include the Caro-Kann ( 1 e4 c6 2 d4 d5 3 exd5 cxd5 4 c4 l2'lf6 5 l2'lc3 e6 6 l2'lf3 J..e7 7 J..d3 dxc4 8 J..xc4), the c3 Sicilian ( 1 e4 c5 2 c3 d5 3 exd5 'i!Vxd5 4 d4 lt:Jf6 5 J..e3 e6 6 lt:Jf3 cxd4 7 cxd4) and the Queen's Gambit Accepted ( 1 d4 d5 2 c4 dxc4 3 lt:Jf3 l2'lf6 4 e3 e6 5 J..xc4 c5 6 O-O a6 7 .i.b3 cxd4 8 exd4). It can also arise with a black pawn on the c-file rather than the e file; for instance, in the Exchange French ( 1 e4 e6 2 d4 d5 3 exd5 exd5 4 l2'lf3 J..d6 5 c4 dxc4 6 .i.xc4) and the Giuoco Piano ( 1 e4 e5 2 l2'lf3 lt:Jc6 3 .i.c4 .i.c5 4 c3 l2'lf6 5 d4 exd4 6 cxd4 J..b4+ 7 J..d2 J..xd2+ 8 l2'lbxd2 d5 9 exd5 lt:Jxd5). And Black can get an IQP him self in many variations, such as the Tarrasch Defence ( 1 d4 d5 2 c4 e6 3 lt:Jc3 c5 4 cxd5 exd5 5 lt:Jf3 l2'lf6 6 g3 lt:Jc6 7 .i.g2 .i.e? 8 O-O O-O 9 .i.g5 cxd4 10 lt:Jxd4) and the French ( 1 e4 e6 2 d4 d5 3 l2'ld2 c5 4 exd5 exd5 5 lt:Jgf3 lt:Jc6 6 .i.b5 .i.d6 7 dxc5 .i.xc5). Idea for White No. 1: d4-d5 Advance First we' ll talk about the advantages of the IQP and discuss the main plan to increase these advantages, the d4-d5 advance. We can see that, in the following diagram, White has a space advantage since he has a central pawn on the fourth rank while Black only has one on the third. This makes it easier for White to develop his pieces actively. The d4-pawn also offers White control of the c5- and e5-squares. The primary plan in these positions is the d4-d5 advance. After ...exd5 and White recapturing on d5 with a piece, we have a position where there are no pawns in the centre, i.e. a very open position. These positions favour the more active side, which in general is the side with the IQP (for the reasons given above). So White should al ways look out for the opportunity to play d5. Idea for White No. 2 : Central Attack White can also use his superior piece activ ity to launch a central attack. This involves
NIMZO-INDIAN 149
sacrificing pieces on f7 and e6 to try to checkmate the black king. Obviously, precise calculation is required, but in the right cir cumstances this plan can be lethal. Idea for White No. 3 : Kingside Attack It's also common for White to launch a kingside attack. There are several ways to increase the pressure on the kingside. One idea is the rook lift :el -e3-h3 (or :d l -d3- h3), which can be very effective. Another possibility is to push the h-pawn, which gives control over g5 and allows a further advance, weakening the black kingside. Idea for White No. 4: Queenside Play White can also engage in queenside play. This involves occupying the c-file with a rook and sometimes putting a knight on c5. Idea for Black: Simplification We've seen lots of promising ideas for the possessor of the IQP. Now we're going to talk about what to do when facing such a pawn. The IQP has two weaknesses: the pawn it self and the square in front of the pawn. The pawn can become weak because, being iso lated, it cannot be protected by another pawn, but instead must rely on pieces. These pieces can end up occupying passive, defensive po sitions. The square in front of the pawn is an other weakness: it can't be controlled by a pawn and hence is a central outpost, and a very nice square for a knight. The way to exploit these advantages is simplification. The IQP tends to get weaker as more pieces are exchanged, because the space advantage it offers is no longer so sig nificant and the defender can organize his pieces to attack the pawn. Also kingside at tacking ideas aren't as promising without lots of pieces. So, when facing the IQP, exchange pieces and try to win an endgame ! Working on the Queenside Weaknesses White often obtains doubled c-pawns in the Nimzo-lndian. The following diagram shows
150 UNDERSTANDING THE CHESS OPENINGS
a model way of attacking them - the bishop is brought to a6, and the knight to c6 and a5 . The c-pawn is pushed to c5 so that the c-file can be opened for a rook at an appropriate moment. A subtle point is that it often helps Black if his d-pawn hasn't moved, since this allows the extravagant ... tbe8-d6 to bring further pressure to bear. Of course, this in volves a lot of pieces which may be needed for the defence of the kings ide if White plays well, but against passive play this plan works like a dream. Samisch & 4 f3
1 d4 tbf6 2 c4 e6 3 tbc3 .i.b4 4 a3
The Samisch variation is in many ways White's most natural response to the Nimzo Indian. As retreating to a5 drops a bishop and retreating elsewhere renders Black's third move useless, the bishop must capture the knight, compromising the white structure af ter 4 ... .i.xc3+ 5 bxc3. Having the two bish ops, White would like to open the position, while Black will try to keep things closed, and can consider an attack on the c4-pawn (now denied pawn support) with moves such as ...c5 (pressurizing the centre and keeping the option of later opening the c-file for a rook), ... b6, ... .i.a6, ... tbc6 and ... tba5. Grimly hanging on to his queenside pawns isn't an inspiring prospect for White, so he' ll try to attack on the kingside to distract Black from the queenside mess.
4 f3 often transposes, and was a big fa
vourite of the then Latvian GM Alexei Shirov when he burst onto the scene. In view of the threatened 5 e4 Black really must play 4 ... d5 now. It's important to understand that, al though Black chose not to play this very pawn advance one move ago, circumstances are now different - the white pawn now sits somewhat uncomfortably on f3 ("ask the g 1-knight what he thinks about the move f3 !" was the late GM Eduard Gufeld's way of de scribing the very similar Samisch variation of the King's Indian), so Black has some reason to be happy with this interposition. After 5 a3, 5 ... .i.xc3+ will transpose to posi tions considered in the main variation, but Black can also consider 5 ... .i.e7 (arguing that White's a3 and f3 are less useful than Black's ... .i.e7), leading to some interesting play af ter 6 e4; for instance, 6 ... dxe4 (6 ...c5 7 cxd5 exd5 8 e5 is another important line) 7 fxe4 e5 ! ? 8 d5 (8 dxe5 ? is completely mistaken after the exchange of queens Black will eas ily regain the e5-pawn in the long run, while the white pawn-structure is ruined) 8 ... .i.c5 9 tbf3 tbg4 ! when White has a spatial advan tage but his king will have to float around the centre of the board.

6 ...d5! The best move - although the straggler on c4 is liquidated, White's pawn-structure is still far from ideal, and preventing e4 is a vi tal concern here as in almost all queen's pawn openings. 7 cxdS liJxdS 8 ifd3 (D) 8 dxc5 is currently more popular, aban doning the idea of setting up a broad centre, but looking to put White's bishop-pair to use in an open position. No prizes for guessing White's next move ! If Black lets White get in 9 e4 'for free' then he would be clearly worse. Thus he must try to gain something from what's about to hap pen, and manages to do so by robbing White of the bishop-pair: 8 ...b6! 9 e4 .ta6! This is a method of developing the bishop known from several variations of the French Defence - there, as here, the object is merely to exchange light-squared bishops. In the French this exchange benefits Black because his bishop is 'bad' (i.e. restricted by its own central pawns), and here it benefits Black because the two bishops would otherwise prove more effective than the black bishop and knight. 10 'fi'd2 .txfl ll 'it>xfl l2Je7 Black intends ... l2Jbc6 with comfortable development for all his pieces, while White hopes after l2Je2, a4 and .ta3 to utilize his space advantage.

It seems like White has given up all hope of playing for e4, but this couldn't be further from the truth- White intends to develop his pieces and then play for e4 at a more oppor tune moment.

Black plans to shut things down with ...e5, when White's dark-squared bishop isn't a happy piece.
5 LLlf3
5 LLle2 is a good alternative, planning to re
capture on c3 with the knight. Black's best approach is thus to avoid the exchange; for instance, 5 ...d5 (5 ...�e8, preparing f8 for the bishop, also makes sense) 6 a3 i.d6 ! ? when after 7 c5 i.e7 Black plans ...c6, ...

The most logical plan would seem to be the advance of the e-pawn, first to e4, and then to e5, to drive Black's knight from f6 and lay the groundwork for a kingside attack. Black in tum must either pre vent the e-pawn's advance or counterattack the white pawn-centre, which will lose some of its solidity the moment the pawn advances from e3 to e4." Black's typical treatment is to play ...e5 ! , freeing his c8-bishop and plan- ning ... e4 to block in the c l -bishop.

time or exchange on c3, when compared to a normal Nimzo-Indian White benefits from his dark-squared bishop being outside the pawn-chain. w 6 d5 6 e3? ! l!Va5 ! is very comfortable for Black. Note that the opening rule of "don't move your queen in the opening" only applies in two cases: 1) You are falling behind in development. 2) The queen is exposed to attack. This second point is really an extension of the first, since the opponent can develop his pieces with gain of time; for instance, 1 e4 e5
2 d4 exd4 3 'ifxd4 ltJc6 ! when Black is al
ready ahead in development. Here neither is the case - Black is actually ahead in development, and is gaining time with his attack on the c3-knight, while the queen can't be attacked by any of the white pieces. The moral from this is that opening rules and opening theory shouldn't be blindly followed - you should know not only the rules and the theory but their rationales, and be prepared to play your own move when it's better! 6 ...d6! Since Black will be left with a light-squared bishop, he wants to place his pawns on dark squares. This concept was well explained by GM Tony Kosten: "Systematically moving your pawns onto the squares of opposite col our to your bishop is a very good habit to get into. If your bishop controls squares of one colour and your pawns the other, they will be working together in a harmonious man ner and this can only benefit your position. Otherwise, you may find that your pawns will impede your bishop, which will become 'bad' ." Note also that Black doesn't rush to ex change on c3 - he may still want to play ...g5, ... ltJe4 and ... 'ifa5 depending on White's set up. So he makes a good necessary move in stead, and thereby retains maximum flexibil ity. 7 e3 Now White might play ltJe2, a3 and get the bishop-for-knight exchange without damag ing his pawn-structure, so it's a good time to chop on c3. 7 ... ..Bxc3+ 8 bxc3 e5!

w As White isn't threatening an immediate e4, Black has slightly more flexibility in his development than he did after 3 l2Jc3. The Queen's Indian aims to develop the c8-bishop (the piece with the clearest future - the b8- knight isn't well placed anywhere yet, and the dark-squared bishop could go to either e7 or b4) while increasing control over the cru cial e4-square. Note also that, with natural development, White has given up the possi bility of f3 and e4, so a bishop on b7 is likely to have a bright future. White has several options:
4 g3 is the most popular, fianchettoing the
king's bishop;
4 a3 is also interesting, preparing l2Jc3
without allowing the pin ...�b4 (note that the immediate 4 l2Jc3 �b4 takes us back into Nimzo-Indian territory);
4 e3 is a natural approach with a fair
amount of sting - White wants to develop nat urally with �d3 and try to gain control of e4. In the next chapter we' ll have a look at 3 ...�b4+, the Bogo Indian, which transposes back into Nimzo waters after 4 l2Jc3 but can also be met by 4 �d2 or 4 l2Jbd2. 4 g3

w The King's Indian has one of the richest histories of any chess opening. Pioneered by Soviet grandmasters in the early 1950s, most notably David Bronstein and Isaak Boleslav sky, it was successfully adopted by Efim Geller and Svetozar Gligoric. The opening owes its modem popularity to Bobby Fischer and Garry Kasparov, both of whom adored the opening and enriched it with numerous theoretical contributions and beautiful victo ries. White has a wide choice of systems against this opening, and all of them have high-level adherents. With the exception of the Fianchetto Vari ation, all the main systems begin by occupy ing the centre (4 e4 d6) and now: The Classical Variation, based on lL'lf3, .Be2 and O-O, remains the critical test. White develops rapidly and doesn't make his centre too huge, and Black can get crushed on the queenside unless he's accurate with his coun terplay, which should be based on ...f5 and a kingside pawn-storm. White also has some Classical offshoots like the Petrosian and the related Averbakh, each of which present Black with unique problems. In the Samisch White tries to solidify the centre with f3 . While this is obviously an at tractive idea, it makes the development of the white minor pieces more problematic, and by committing so many pawns to light squares, allows Black extra options on the dark squares. The Four Pawns Attack launches forward with f4. If this worked then no one could play the King's Indian any more, but at present Black is holding his own in the complica tions. One final note before we get started. In the forthcoming sections, you'll see that Black often needs to sacrifice material in order to maintain an acceptable position, or take on horrible positional weaknesses to activate his pieces. I think that the opening is sound, and these concessions lead to good compensa tion, but if you disagree then there's nothing wrong with your chess judgement - you simply should play something else.

The broad pattern of play in the most criti cal King's Indian lines is depicted in the dia gram. Both sides launch their pawns forward on the wings where they hold a space advan tage - White wants to create a queenside weakness with cxd6 or c6, while Black wants either to open lines or to cramp the white king to such an extent that he can develop an irresistible attack.

7 O-O
7 dxe5 dxe5 8 'i!Vxd8 �xd8 isn't dangerous for Black, though it is always tedious when one plays such a fighting opening only to en counter such a wet response. However, such positions are largely unavoidable and Black must content himself with two thoughts: 1) White has absolutely no advantage. In some ways, therefore, this line is at least as risky for White as the sharper main lines, since Black can already start thinking about gaining the advantage. Bobby Fischer once famously commented that "You've got to equalize with Black before you start looking for something" - well, here Black has fully equalized, so start looking ! 2) Many players mentally 'switch off' when they go into a quiet endgame, thinking that any move will suffice for a draw. Even without such a mindset, endgames are one of the richest and most complex areas of chess, and there is really as much scope to outplay one's opponent here as in any other position. After 9 il.g5 (9 tbxe5? tbxe4 ! 10 tbxe4 il.xe5 is pleasant for Black - the d4-square is inviting) 9 ...�e8 10 tbd5 tbxd5 11 cxd5 c6 ! 1 2 il.c4 cxd5 1 3 il.xd5 tbd7 !

However, a pawn is only weak if it can be effectively attacked, and here this isn't the case. Bronstein wrote about a similar King's Indian position: "Here it seems high time to reveal to the reader the secret of Black's d-pawn in the King's Indian. Although the pawn stands on an open file and is subject to constant pressure it proves to be a tough nut to crack. This is because it is not easy to get at the pawn. It would appear that there is nothing simpler than to move the knight away from d4 so as to press on the pawn, but the point is that the knight is badly needed on d4 where it has the task of observ ing the squares b5, c6, e6 and f5, as well as neutralizing Black's fianchettoed bishop. The knight can really only move away when White has safeguarded himself from such attacks as ...a5-a4-a3, ... �e6 and ...f5. Meanwhile, however, Black too has fully organized his position. Therefore the weakness of the black d-pawn is illusory." To be honest, opening knowledge doesn't get much more advanced than this. If you can understand the reasons behind the moves that you play, you're half way there. A recent game continued 1 0 'iii> h 1 4:Jbd7 1 1 �g5 Vi'b6 1 2 tt::l b3 a5 1 3 'ifc 1 a4 14

w Beginning a very slow and very dangerous attack. While at grandmaster level White scores very well here, at lower levels I'd have to put my money on Black since he'll always have attacking chances and White needs a high level of skill to pick the right defensive set-up. n:ct Pushing the c-pawn is a vital source of play for White, so this move gets full marks. Plus (once the c-file is opened) the possibility of 4Jb5-c7 can cause Black a huge headache. 1 3 a4 tries to open another avenue of at tack - the a-pawn is going to walk as far as it's allowed.

The immediate 5 ...c5 is less popular since it displaces the black king: 6 dxc5 dxc5 7 'i¥xd8+ 'iii' xd8. White can now build up with 8 i.e3 and 9 O-O-O+, or try to lock out the g7 -bishop with 8 e5 ! ? tiJfd7 9 f4. 6 i.e3 This has declined in popularity due to the gambit introduced by Black's next move. 6 i.g5 aims for an improved version of the note to White's seventh move, but Black shouldn't really have any problems. After 6 . .. c5 7 d5 e6 8 �d2 exd5 9 cxd5 a6 1 0 a4 h6 !

Yes, this chucks away a pawn, but such tri fles rarely matter to a red-blooded King's In dian player. The weakening of White's dark squares is a much more important prize. 6 ... tDc6 (D) is a logical choice in many King's Indian lines. w Some subtle points need to be appreciated here (after ...e5 d5) - while in the Classical this knight is headed for e7, and in the Fian chetto it often ends up on a5, in the Samisch the square for the horse is d4. This often en tails a pawn sacrifice, which is especially sound when White has to give up his dark squared bishop to bag the material, since with all his pawns on light squares he really needs this prelate to cover the gaps. Black has an al ternative strategy to a quick ...e5 though - he can exploit the vacant b8-square by playing ...a6, ... l:tb8 and ...b5 to chip away at the white pawn-wall, a strategy which is espe cially natural when White castles queenside. Now 7 tiJge2 a6 8 'i!Vd2 l:tb8 (with ideas of ...b5 and/or ...e5) 9 tiJc l (this puts the brakes on ...b5 ; 9 h4 h5 10 O-O-O is the major alterna tive, with a scrap after 1 0. ..b5) 9 ...e5 ! 1 0 d5 tiJd4 ! begins a beautifully thematic King's Indian sequence: 1 1 tD 1 e2 c5 12 dxc6 bxc6 ! 1 3 tDxd4 exd4 14 i.xd4 'ii a5 1 51;ld l i.e6 1 6 b 3 c5 1 7 i.e3 tiJg4 ! 1 8 tiJd5 �xd2+ 19 i.xd2 i.xd5 20 cxd5 tiJe5 2 1 'iii' f2 f5 22 exf5 l:txf5 with good play for the pawn. 6 ...e5, despite Kasparov's patronage, isn't as popular.

w Don't let the apparent similarity with the King's Indian fool you - this opening is to tally different. While Black appears to be staking a central claim with his d-pawn, it only takes a little analysis to see that White can set up a big pawn-centre with 4 cxd5 tbxd5 5 e4 ltJxc3 6 bxc3. Black's idea is to hit the centre as hard as he can with pieces - ... i.g7, ...c5 and ... ltJc6. White has a few re sponses he can try. The most natural and critical is to set up the big pawn-centre as indicated above - this is the Exchange Variation and is the subject of the first two sections. Alternatively (normally with 4 tbf3 i.g7 included, but these moves can be delayed), White can try to force ...dxc4, either with di rect pressure on d5 (5 'i!Vb3, the Russian Sys tem) or through attacking a defender (5 i.g5) or overworking another defender (5 i.f4, hit ting the c7-pawn and so trying to tie up the black queen) - the latter systems are covered under 'Early Bishop Moves' . Finally, throughout queen's pawn open ings White has a fianchetto option, and the Grtinfeld is no exception. White normally delays ltJc3 for this one (preferring 3 ltJf3 or 3 g3) - we already saw several good ...d6 sys tems against this in the King's Indian section, and now we'll see what happens when Black tries ...d5 (with or without ...c6). Grunfeld Centre This centre is characteristic of the Ex change Grii nfeld. White occupies, Black pres surizes. If White can maintain his centre as is, then he will hold the advantage, since his pawns grant his pieces extra room to operate and cramp the black minor pieces. Black must put as much pressure as possible on d4, as illustrated, and try to get White to move ei ther his d-pawn (opening up the long diago nal) or e-pawn (weakening d5).

This position is one of the game's richest. Black is a pawn up, in return for which White has a lead in development. This time advan tage is nourished by Black's difficulty in de veloping his remaining pieces - a knight on c6 would be attacked by the d-pawn, while the c8-bishop will have to abandon the b7- pawn in order to move to g4. There are alter native ways to develop these pieces (the knight can go to b6 or the bishop to b7) but these take longer to implement. In addition, the black queen is open to harassment - one of the drawbacks of this variation for Black is that, in many of his best lines, his queen can be subject to a perpetual attack, with a three fold repetition and draw. Moving on to the pawns, at first glance it seems the connected black passed pawns on the queenside are ex tremely dangerous (especially since one of them is extra), but in fact the one to watch is the white d-pawn. White generally hits the e7-pawn with .i.g5 (though he needs to de fend his own e4-pawn before he genuinely threatens to capture), and once this is gone the white d-pawn can march up the board, gaining space and collecting squares as well as threatening to queen. ••• .i.g4 1 2. ..b6 1 3 'i!Vc l .i.b7 is very logical.

After 1 3 .i.b4 lDb6 14 �a1 'i!Ve6 1 5 'iVb 1 .i.d7 Khalifman introduced 16 :a5 !, controlling lots ofj uicy squares, with slightly better chances for White. 13 .i.gS The immediate 1 3 .i.e3 has been tried by several big names, most notably Krarnnik.

This line is known as the Russian System because of the players involved in its early development, especially Botvinnik. By de veloping his queen, White generates more pressure on d5, and gets a perfect pawn centre and a space advantage with all the pieces still on the board. The drawback? White still has to prove that the queen's posi tion in the centre is a strength, not a target for the black minor pieces, and White is a long way from finishing development, which gives Black good opportunities for counterplay. 5 ••• dxc4 The most combative.

w This move introduces a very ambitious concept. Black stakes a claim on the dark squares, which is good, but gives White a big space advantage, which is bad. Thus the po sition is unbalanced from move 2, which makes these systems perfect playgrounds for players who want to win with Black and are willing to take some risks in order to do so. 3 d5 . Black will now put his bishop on g7, where it isn't impeded by the c5-pawn, but he has a wide choice of how to set up his pawns. The most dynamic option is to play ...e6 and (by ...exd5 cxd5) exchange his e-pawn for the white c-pawn (the Modem Benoni). This gives White a very dangerous central majority and Black a very dangerous queen side majority, so both sides must be very pre cise. Alternatively, Black can sacrifice his a and b-pawns for the white c-pawn and use the two queenside files for sustained counter play. This is known as the Benko Gambit. Finally, Black can block the position with ...e5. This option (the Czech Benoni) isn't as challenging as the other two. White can also play more quietly with 3 ltJf3, but after 3 ...cxd4 4 ltJxd4 the structural change is in Black's favour and he has a choice of favourable transpositions into Si cilian, Nimzo-Indian, English and Grtinfeld positions.

like this. It' s true that an e5 advance from White is eliminated from the position, but the absence of an ...e6 break to challenge the white pawns is a major defect. Moreover, Black' s dark-squared bishop will be dead wood for the foreseeable future. 4 tLlc3 d6 5 e4 g6 (5 ... .i.e7 is of about equal value: 6 .i.e2 O-O 7 �f3 lLlbd7 8 O-O �e8 9 a3 ! and White will be very fast on the queenside).

When Black flicks in ...exd5 at a later point, then cxd5 leads us back to main-line positions; �xd5 allows good play after ...�c6 and a fu ture ... �d4; while exd5 leaves White with a tiny edge but without any pawn-breaks, so Black is comfortable. 5 cxd5 d6 (D) w This line was made extremely popular by the savage attacking efforts of two world champions, Mikhail Tal and Garry Kasparov. Black immediately gets a very big trump, namely a mobile queenside majority which will be supported by a monster bishop on g7. The price which he has to pay for this privi lege is not so much a lack of central space (this is common to most openings) but a lack of central stability - White's extra e-pawn threatens to run to e5 and cause havoc. I re member a Modem Benoni specialist, GM John Emms, writing of the black set-up as a 'bag of tricks' , which seems a good way to read these positions - Black has lots of tacti cal chances, but his position is always on a knife edge.
6 e4 (D)
White has a quieter option in 6 �f3 g6 7 g3. This has always made less sense to me than the fianchetto against the King's Indian and the Griinfeld, since here the white pawn is fixed on d5 and so the bishop's scope is limited. After 7 ... .i.g7 8 .i.g2 O-O 9 O-O �bd7

w This has never really been popular, though its patronage by Botvinnik has to be noted. Even though no complete refutation has been found, I think that most GMs are reluctant to weaken their e5-square and a2-g8 diagonal so early in the proceedings. I've spent less space on the Dutch than on most openings, since it leaves White with relatively few problems gaining an advantage. The Dutch is three systems bundled into one. The first, the Stonewall, is marked by black pawns on c6, d5, e6 and f5, a structure not without defects but which also offers un usual advantages, like solidity, restriction of the white e4 break (an important tool in the Dutch) and a central space advantage. The Leningrad sees the fianchetto of the black dark-squared bishop, coupled with ...d6. Black aims for the ...e5 break, which could equalize instantly, but in the meantime cre ates a nasty hole on e6. The final system, the Classical, creates fewer weaknesses (a bishop on e7 behind e6- and d6-pawns) but confers correspondingly fewer benefits - the black plan of attack with ... 'i1Ve8-h5 and a rook-lift to the h-file looks a little primitive against precise play, so the modem interpretation relies more on restraint ( ...a5) and exchange ( ... l2Je4). Stonewall

Counterintuitive? Sure. But practice has shown that this method of holding the b pawn is preferable to the dark-square weak ening entailed in 7 b3. Note also that, al though 1 00% of the developed pieces are black, the queen and knight can't do much damage on their own.

Throughout queen's pawn openings we saw the utility of the c-pawn - White's gen erally goes to c4, from where it can pressur ize the black d-pawn or go to c5 to cramp the opponent, while the black c-pawn has both defensive (the Slav) and offensive (the Tar rasch) potential. Basically, the blocking of the c-pawn is why 2 lbc3 is played far less frequently than 2 c4, and Black has some well-established routes to equality. Depending on his normal repertoire, he can transpose into his favourite lines like the Classical French (2 ...e6 3 e4 d5), the Pirc (2 ... g6 3 e4 d6) or the Philidor (2 ...d6 3 e4 e5 4 lbf3). 2 ••• d5 However, this is overwhelmingly the most popular response, pinpointing the fact that White has no real pawn-breaks, while Black can still strike with ...c5. 3 i.g5 (D)

This is a tricky one. Invented by the Mol davian coach Chebanenko and introduced by his students, this has since been adopted with success by top-class GM Viktor Bologan. The usual warnings about blocking one's c pawn in queen's pawn openings apply, of course, but here Black's basic idea is to play ...e5 . White generally stops this, when the game (after 3 �f3 e6) can transpose to rare variations of the QGD after . . .d5 or the Nimzo-Indian after . . . ..i.b4. Accordingly the Black Knights' Tango is a very flexible sys tem, and should be met with respect. Black has another dynamic method of hit ting the d-pawn, the Budapest Gambit, which begins 2 ...e5 . The problem is that White has promising play whether he hangs on to or re turns the pawn, so I wouldn't recommend the line. 3 dxe5 �g4 (3 ... �e4 4 �f3 ..i.b4+ 5 ..i.d2 �xd2 6 �bxd2 �c6 7 a3 ..i.xd2+ 8 'ii' xd2 'ii e7 9 'ii c3 leaves Black a pawn down for less than nothing) 4 �f3 ( 4 �h3 is a use ful alternative, returning the pawn but aiming to clamp down on the d5-square with �f4) 4 ... �c6 5 ..i.f4 ..i.b4+ 6 �c3 'Wie7 7 'Wid5 and Black has no real compensation for his lost pawn. We now return to the position after 2 .. .�c6
(D):
3 �f3 3 �c3 e5 4 d5 �e7 looks alright for Black.
3 d5 seems to gain less in time than it loses
in flexibility: 3 ...�e5 4 e4 e6 (not 4 .. .�xe4?? 5 'iYd4) 5 iVd4 ..i.b4+ 6 ..i.d2 ..i.xd2+ 7 �xd2 d6 and Black can increase his dark-square control with ...c5 . 3 ... e6 3 ...d6 is also possible. 4 �c3 e5 can trans- pose to a King's Indian after 5 d5 �e7 6 e4 g6, though with 4 d5 �e5 5 �xe5 dxe5 White secures a useful structural advantage. w 4 �c3
4 a3 was Kasparov's choice when he faced
the line. Then: a) 4 ...d5 5 �c3 dxc4 6 e4 �a5 7 ..i.xc4 �xc4 8 �a4+ and 9 �xc4 with an extremely strong centre . b) Black sometimes also plays a 'Hippo' formation with 4 .. . d6 5 �c3 g6 6 e4. The Hippo has never really been defined, but as far as I can see it involves fianchettoing both bishops while also playing ... d6 and . . . e6 - Black sits back and provokes White into over-extending. Such openings are playable, but require a high level of skill to handle - GMs Tony Miles and Luke McShane did well here, but those without their talent will struggle with so little central control .
4 g3 is also very logical, with themes
from the Catalan and Queen 's Indian float ing around. 4 ... ..i.b4 Now it's a Nimzo-Indian of sorts. 5 'ifc2 A knight on c6 is unusual in the Classical Nimzo, so this is a natural choice.

As central control and good development are so important during the opening, man kind would have been forgiven for thinking that 1 e4 and 1 d4 were the only worthwhile first moves. However, the games of Howard Staunton demonstrated another approach, beginning with 1 c4 - White doesn't imme diately occupy the centre with his pawns but instead prefers to control the central squares (with a pawn on c4, knights on c3 and f3, and a bishop on g2), waiting for Black to re veal his development before committing the e- and d-pawns. This approach can begin with a wide variety of moves - 1 c4 is the English, but 1 tbf3 and 1 g3 are also often played, and generally transpose into English positions. This brings up the first point to appreciate about the English and the other flank openings - there are more transposi tions here than in most other openings. This is because White ' s approach is normally predicated on avoiding an early central clash, and so there are few checks, captures or other forcing moves. His development is so self-contained, it' s easy to implement against any black formation and gives Black a wide choice in how to respond. The key to study ing such openings effectively is not to get too bogged down in whether White plays 1 c4, 2 tbf3 and 3 g3 or these moves in any other order, but rather to understand a whole formation. Many games which begin as a flank opening transpose into 1 e4 and 1 d4 stuff - for instance, against Black' s most popular response to 1 c4 ( l . ..tbf6), 2 d4 brings us directly back into 1 d4 territory. If Black wants to avoid these transpositions, he has two main methods: l . . .c5 and l . . .e5 . We'll look at all the important stuff after 1 c4, while 1 tbf3 generally transposes but there is one major independent option which will be considered. Finally we' ll look at some much rarer openings, which some times come up. Engl ish Symmetrical : Queenside Play

White has a wide choice on his second move - apart from this development, both 2 tt::l f3 and 2 g3 are popular. All can transpose to the same positions, but there are subtle dif ferences - if White wishes to have the option of the d4 advance, then 2 lt:Jf3 is the most ac curate, while if he wants to emphasize his control over d5 then 2 lt:Jc3 or 2 g3 is best. One unusual possibility results after 2 g3 d5 !?, when following 3 cxd5 'ii' xd5 4 lt:Jf3 lt:Jc6 5 .i.g2 Suba recommends ...e5 followed by ... 'ifd7, with a Rubinstein-type set-up (see the note to White's 3rd move in the next sec tion). 2 .•. lt:Jc6 3 g3 g6 4 ii.g2 .i.g7 (D) w It's pretty easy to see what's going on here. Black copies the white formation, looking for a favourable moment to deviate. White, meanwhile, must judge correctly when he should break the symmetry with an aggres sive move - in our main variation, he doesn't do this until move 1 3 ! 5 lt:Jf3

White plans to expand on the queenside with l:.b1 and b4, harmonizing beautifully with the g2-bishop. Now: a) My own preference here would be 5 ...d6 6 l:tb1 aS, forcefully restraining the b4 break at the cost of a weak b5-square. After 7 lt:Jf3 e5 ! 8 O-O lt:Jge7 Black has a Botvinnik-type formation (see the section on the Botvinnik System), with all the attendant ideas, and I think this should be enough for equality. b) 5 ...e6 allows White an adventurous possibility: 6 b4 !, when 6 ... lt:Jxb4 (best, since 6 ...cxb4 7 axb4 lt:Jxb4 8 .i.a3 gives juicy compensation) 7 axb4 cxb4 8 d4 bxc3 9 e3 followed by lt:Je2 gives White good Benko style compensation for the pawn. c) 5 ...a6 6 .:tb1 :tb8 7 b4 cxb4 8 axb4 b5 !

While White later dis covered the idea of O-O, lLle 1 and f4 to strike at the black centre, I don't feel he can hope for an advantage in this line.

A favourite of Mikhail Botvinnik, who adopted this pawn-structure with both colours in a wide range of openings. White accepts a big hole on d4 in return for greater control over d5 and f5. This system is easy to play and has found many advocates over the years. 5 ... d6 6 lt:Jge2 lt:Jge7 The knights belong here, as the f-pawns are free to advance. Also, a knight on f3 or f6 would be vulnerable to a bishop pin, gaining control of the d-file outposts. For instance, 6 ... lt:Jf6 7 d3 O-O (7 ...h6 ! is an improvement, but the f-pawn is still stuck) 8 .tg5 followed by lt:Jd5 with a comfortable edge.

10 b4 aS! (D)
w There's an old rule which says "don't play on the side where you're weaker". Certainly it makes sense to play where one's better, but such a dogmatic rule can only limit one's playing strength and this position is a good il lustration of why this is the case. Though White is attacking on the queenside, Black's last move highlights a defect in the white ad vance - the pawns lack fully adequate sup port. The b-pawn can't be held in its current location, and since capturing on a5 leaves Black with a structural advantage, the only option is to push further.

Of course White can now transpose directly into a Nimzo by playing 3 d4, but here we're concerned with his attempts to keep the game in English channels. 3 tbf3 This is very logical - the fact that the pawn isn't yet on d4 means that the knight won't be pinned by a bishop on b4.
3 e4 ! ? (D) is a much sharper attempt, called
the Mikenas Attack. Then:

White has very little, if anything. How ever, instead of the normal Griinfeld counter play, Black is obliged to maintain the balance in a rather dull position, and for this reason the line could be worth a go by White. Engl ish Defence

This is the English Defence, which was a favourite playground of the late and great Tony Miles. It can also be played against I d4: l ...e6 2 c4 b6 (though Black needs to be ready for a transposition to the French in this case). The logic is simple - entice White to occupy a big part of the centre, then break down his construction. 2 d4 2 lDc3 i.b7 3 e4 is an interesting idea - Black can point to the d4-square with 3 ...e5 ! ? or keep matters more typically English with 3 ... e6 4 lDf3 i.b4 and 5 ... lDe7. 2 • • • e6 2 ... i.b7 is also possible, but Black doesn't want to place any obstacles in the way of White's central occupation. w
3 e4 i.b7 (D)
Now White faces a choice. 4 i.d3 The most solid move - everywhere else Black generates substantial counterplay. 4 d5? ! is a move Black is praying for - for instance, 4 ... lDf6 5 i.d3 b5 ! 6 cxb5 exd5 when White's position has lost all its shape. 4 lDc3 allows 4 . . . i.b4, which I'd rather prevent. An old Miles game went 5 'ifc2 'ifh4 ! 6 i.d3 f5 ! and White was already struggling to hold things together.
4 f3 is the kind of move I prefer to avoid
when possible. Miles introduced the remark able 4 ...f5 ! 5 exf5 lDh6 6 fxe6 lDf5 ! ! , and won a number of remarkable games remark ably quickly too. 4 ... lDc6 4 ... f5 is still played by some die-hards, but really looks like too much: 5 exf5 ! i.xg2 6 'ifh5+ g6 7 fxg6 i.g7 and White gets to take some pot shots at the cost of a rook after 8 gxh7+ �f8 9 i.g5 lDf6 1 0 'ifh4 i.xh l 1 1 lDe2. 5 lDf3 lDb4 6 O-O lDxd3 7 'ifxd3 (D)

Larsen's Opening is one of White's more logical first moves, aiming to fianchetto the queen's bishop.
1 b4 (Sokolsky's Opening) is a kind of ac
celerated version of this idea, with the idea that after l . ..e5 2 .i.b2 Black can't support the e-pawn with 2 ....� bc6.
