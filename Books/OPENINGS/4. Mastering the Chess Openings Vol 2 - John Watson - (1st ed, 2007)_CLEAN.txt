As in Volume 1 , which examines 1 e4, I work from the ground up, starting with the very first moves of each opening to explain its elementary properties. Someone with only a modicum of playing experience should be able to master these fundamentals and use them as a basis for under standing the more sophisticated material that follows. For a primer on the rudimentary principles that apply to all opening play, please refer to Chapter 1 of Volume 1 . The next two chapters of that volume may also be useful, since they identify the ideas and themes most often referred to in the book as a whole. My philosophy is the same in both volumes, but a few points bear repeating. These books are not meant to cover all openings, much less all of their variations; such an undertaking would require scores of volumes. Instead, I have selected systems that I consider the most useful for the sake of explanation and instruction. In the main, these are the most 'important' openings, in that they have had a large following through the years and have a well-developed theoretical underpinning. Within these major openings I have picked a number of variations to study in some detail, based upon the belief that in-depth familiarity with several variations is better than superficial under standing of all. In order to place this selection in context, I leave signposts to indicate the direction in which alternatives may lead. While some of the games and analysis are recent, many classic examples are used to illustrate general points. This is not primarily a theoretical tome: some of the opinions that I venture about the value of hotly-contested individual lines will undoubtedly prove wrong or irrelevant. Instead, my goal is to provide a solid basis for the reader to play openings successfully, emphasizing positional features and techniques that extend to variations beyond those at hand. Notice that this differs from a full ex planation of an opening using concepts specific to that opening. We shall see that individual moves themselves express ideas, whether or not they fit into a general scheme that has previously been set forth. Accordingly, a certain level of detail is absolutely necessary to understand both the consis tent strategies and the anomalies that can render such strategies irrelevant. On a practical level, I have subjected readers to recitations about the niceties of move-orders; the associated issues can be confusing but bear a direct relation to real-world results. Assessments of variations can evolve very rapidly, but how one best arrives at the desired starting points tends not to change much. In the next chapter I examine the fundamental characteristics of 1 d4 and how it differs from 1 e4. You will find further comparisons between these moves in both volumes. The study of 1 d4 by itself will suffice to improve your chess understanding by leaps and bounds, but if you truly aspire to master the game you will want to know as much as possible about the e-pawn openings as well. I sincerely hope that these volumes will help you in both respects.
1 Introduction to 1 d4 and the
Closed Games At the most basic level, 1 d4 might seem to resemble 1 e4. It brings a pawn to the fourth rank to occupy the centre and frees a bishop for action. Very much as the main 'goal' of 1 e4 is to enforce a successful d4, it may be said that after 1 d4 White's goal is to achieve e4. Never theless, even from this most primitive stand point, we can see that 1 e4 only controls one central square (d5) and 1 d4 controls two (d4 and e5). This latter quality accounts for some immediate differences between opening with the queen's pawn and the king's pawn. For ex ample, when we look at the defences to 1 e4, some of them attack e4 directly: the Alekhine Defence (1 e4 tZ'Bf6) and the Scandinavian De fence ( 1 e4 d5). Others allow 2 d4 and then at tack e4 on Black's 2nd move: the Caro-Kann Defence ( 1 e4 c6 2 d4 d5), the French Defence (1 e4 e6 2 d4 d5) and the Pirc Defence ( 1 e4 d6
2 d4 tZ'Bf6). But versus 1 d4, none of Black's
major defences attack the d4-pawn, and none even allow 2 e4, i.e., these defences all start with either l .. .d5 or l ...tZ'Bf6, fighting for con trol of e4. It doesn't take much thought to see how that difference arises: after 1 e4 White's e-pawn is unprotected, meaning that attacking it with tempo can bring significant rewards, or at least a temporary initiative. Since White' s d-pawn is already protected by his queen after 1 d4, the chances for Black to gain the initiative by tar geting it are correspondingly low. On the other hand, when he plays 1 d4, White has done nothing to contribute towards castling kingside. In fact, he often follows up with the moves 2 c4, 3 tbc3 and in some cases moves such as 4 .i.f4, 4 .i.g5 or 4 'ifc2, none of which clear the way for kingside castling. One might argue that in such situations White's prospects of queenside castling are enhanced, since early moves by the knight, bishop, and queen clear the road for castling queenside. However, apart from a few attacking lines such as the Exchange Queen's Gambit and the Samisch Variation of the King's Indian, White seldom avails himself of the opportunity to cas tle queenside. As is the case in most chess openings, queenside castling carries with it too many risks in terms of exposing White's king to quick attacks. Then the question becomes whether Black can gain anything from White's delayed king side castling. Can he put pressure on White that requires a degree of compromise in White's strategic plans? Before turning to 1 d4 d5, let's consider the Indian Defences that begin with 1 d4 tDf6. The answer to our question changes with each opening and in each variation. In the main line of the King's Indian Defence, for ex ample, Black puts very little pressure on White while he's getting castled, since his first five moves don't threaten anything or even directly challenge the centre. For example, the main line goes 1 d4 tDf6 2 c4 g6 3 tbc3 .i.g7 4 e4 d6 5 tbf3 O-O 6 .i.e2 with 7 O-O next. As in all major openings, Black's counterplay is based upon a central advance, normally the move ...e5. In that case White has great strategic leeway and
10 MASTERING THE CHESS OPENINGS
delayed castling hasn't proved a decisive factor in the ensuing play. Furthermore, White can achieve positions in which his moves allow rapid castling anyway; e.g., 1 d4 tDf6 2 c4 g6 3 tbf3 i.g7 4 g3 d6 5 i.g2 and 6 O-O. But if White plays more ambitiously and delays O-O longer, he may run into other issues - for example, af ter 5 f4 O-O 6 tbf3 c5 7 d5 e6 8 i.e2 exd5 9 cxd5. In that case White has exposed his e4- pawn, which can't be supported by other pawns. Thus Black can play 9 ...�e8, leaving White having to respond to the threat on his e-pawn before being able to castle. White's e-pawn is not always Black's main target. For example, in the main line of the Ex change Griinfeld, 1 d4 tZ'Bf6 2 c4 g6 3 tbc3 d5 4 cxd5 tbxd5 5 e4 tbxc3 6 bxc3 i.g7, White needs to set up his pieces having in mind Black's quick attack on his d4-pawn by ...c5 and ... tbc6. This means that White is confined to just a few ways of rearranging his pieces in order to bring his king to safety, placing them on what he may consider non-optimal squares; for instance, 7 i.c4 c5 8 tbe2 tbc6 9 i.e3. Or, in the process of shoring up his centre with pieces, White might allow Black to play . . .cxd4 and ... �a5+ on the move before he's managed to ar range O-O; for example, 7 tDf3 O-O 8 �bl c5 9 i.e2 cxd4 1 0 cxd4 �a5+. More obvious situa tions arise from variations in the same opening such as 1 d4 tZ'Bf6 2 c4 g6 3 tbc3 d5 4 i.f4 and 4 i.g5, in which Black can play ...c5 and White's necessary defensive moves relate directly to his delayed kingside development and inability to castle quickly. In the Nimzo-Indian Defence, 1 d4 tZ'Bf6 2 c4 e6 3 tZ'Bc3 i.b4, there are several situations in which Black can play ... tbe4 quickly in order to disturb White's plans on the kingside. Two ex amples are 4 tZ'Bf3 b6 5 i.g5 h6 6 i.h4 i.b7 7 e3 g5 8 i.g3 tbe4 and 4 tbf3 c5 5 g3 tbe4. If White plans to play i.d3 and tbge2, he might run into, for example, 4 e3 b6 5 i.d3 i.b7, when White will normally play 6 tbf3, because after 6 tbe2 he can't castle in time to protect his g-pawn. Of course there are just as many variations in which delaying O-O doesn't affect White's plans, but in contrast to most l e4 openings he has to take into account the trade-offs involved in delaying his kingside development. Openings beginning with 1 d4 d5 (D) are known as the 'Closed Games' . We shall begin our 1 d4 investigations in the next two chapters by examining those openings. Black emphasizes prevention of e4, since that would ideally be White's next move. In fact, very seldom will you see a successful e4 on one of the first six or seven moves of a Queen's Gam bit Declined (2 c4 e6) or a Slav (2 c4 c6), which are the most important Closed Games. This con trasts with both the King's Indian and Griinfeld Defences mentioned above. Still, the impor tance of the move e4 motivates both sides' play. White's predominant response to l ...d5 is 2 c4, clearly aimed at undermining d5 and thus shak ing Black's control of e4. With the positional threat of 3 cxd5 �xd5 4 tbc3 and 5 e4, Black usually feels compelled to prevent the key move e4 even at the cost of compromising his position. Thus we see the main lines 2 ... e6 and 2 ...c6. As explained in the next chapter about the Queen's Gambit Declined (2. .. e6), other second moves tend to give White a central majority in return for Black's lead in development. What we'll find is that although Black can cope with or prevent e4 in the Closed Games, he doesn't get away un touched in doing so. In the next two chapters, we'll discuss the ways in which White can try to exploit Black's concessions within the context of specific, selected opening variations. We shall also see how Black tries to combine pressure upon White's centre with maximum activity for his pieces. The Closed Games with 1 d4 d5 are rightly considered essential to the education of all developing players.
2 Queen's Gambit Declined
1 d4 d5 2 c4 (D)
This is the venerable Queen's Gambit, the most popular response to 1 ... d5 by a huge mar gin (all the more so if you include 2 ll:lf3 fol lowed by 3 c4). White's immediate goal is to break down Black's control over d5, or other wise gain concessions from him. This chapter is primarily about 2 ... e6, and includes short sections on other less important ways to decline the gambit. Before moving on to more sophisticated anal ysis, I should stipulate that the Queen's Gambit is not a gambit in the sense of giving up a pawn for the sake of other compensating factors. White can recover his pawn almost immedi ately after 2 ... dxc4 3 e3 or 3 ll:lf3 or even 3 e4. To show this, let's try the simple 3 e3, intending 4 ..txc4 with easy development. At this point Black has a perfectly acceptable game by re turning the pawn. He can play 3 ... ll:lf6 4 ..txc4 e6, for example. But Black doesn't normally try to hang on to the pawn by 3 ...b5? because it leads to a disadvantage. White plays 4 a4 ! (D). Here Black needs to avoid 4 ... c6? 5 axb5 cxb5?? 6 �f3, attacking the rook on a8 and winning at least a piece. But other moves return the pawn under poor circumstances; for exam ple, 4 ... bxa4 5 ..txc4 .Bb7 6 l2lf3 e6 7 �xa4+, or 4 ... ..td7 5 axb5 ..txb5 6 l2lc3 c6 7 b3 ! cxb3 8 ll:lxb5 cxb5 9 ..txb5+ ll:ld7 10 �xb3. In these positions White has the advantages of the cen tral majority and pressure on Black's weakened queenside. On the other hand, Black can't just sit around. The move 2 c4 attacks his d5-pawn, and if White were given a free move he would play 3 cxd5 �xd5 4 ll:lc3, gaining a tempo on the queen, and play 5 e4 next. That would establish the classic ideal centre. How to respond? If Black doesn't want to accept the gambit, he can choose to defend his pawn by 2 ... e6 or 2 ...c6. Alternatively he can decline by counterattack with, for example, 2 ...e5, 2 ... ..tf5 or 2 ... ll:lc6. These latter moves are relatively less com mon, and we shall look at them shortly. But first I want to make some introductory comments about Black's main choice: 2 ...e6 (D) The position after 2 ... e6 introduces the clas sical Queen's Gambit Declined, an opening ri valling the Ruy Lopez as the greatest in chess history. For generations this move was almost obligatory at the highest levels. The greats such as Steinitz, Lasker, Capablanca, and Alekhine chose in it in the vast majority of the games in which they confronted l d4 d5 2 c4. The 1 927 World Championship match between Alekhine and Capablanca featured no fewer than 32 out of 34 games with the Queen's Gambit Declined.
12 MASTERING THE CHESS OPENINGS
Although no longer holding such an exalted status, 2 ...e6 has remained the most important defence to the Queen's Gambit throughout the years and into the present. In some ways this is strange, because Black imprisons his bishop on c8 behind its own pawns. This is no trivial mat ter, since the bishop won't be able to participate in the struggle to control the centre nor in any active role. As usual, pieces condemned to stay ing on the first rank cause other problems, such as interfering with the connection of the rooks. The struggle to free the light-squared bishop and find a good spot for it is arguably Black's main problem in the Queen's Gambit De clined (a.k.a. 'QGD'). As Kasparov indicates, the theme of finding a role for this bishop per meates the theory of the opening, and even complex ideas can often be reduced to it. The obvious question, then, is why Black would subject himself to a potentially arduous task. What happens if Black doesn't block off his bishop? A superficial explanation concerns the two conventional alternatives. First, accepting the pawn by 2 ... dxc4 immediately cedes the centre to White. And in both Queen's Gambit Ac cepted theory and practice, it turns out that ...e6 is usually played within a few moves, before Black's c8-bishop is developed anyway ! For example, the traditional main line of the Queen's Gambit Accepted is 1 d4 d5 2 c4 dxc4 3 tl:lf3 tl:lf6 4 e3 e6 5 ..txc4 c5, when that bishop is left sitting on its original square behind the e6- pawn. By contrast, the Slav Defence with 2 ...c6 keeps the c8-bishop open for development, but it takes away the best square for Black's queen's knight. The move 2 ...c6 also foregoes ...c5, which is one of Black' s most effective ways to attack White's centre. Furthermore, Black's two main lines in the Slav Defence are hardly per fect solutions to the light-squared bishop prob lem. After 2 ...c6 3 tl:lf3, he can choose the extremely popular Semi-Slav by 3 ... tl:lf6 (or 3 ...e6) 4 tl:lc3 e6, in which case the bishop on c8 is still hemmed in, even more so than after 2 ...e6. The most favourable variation in this re spect is the old main line 3 ... tl:lf6 4 tl:lc3 dxc4 5 a4 ..tf5. While this develops the bishop quite actively, it comes at the cost of giving White a central majority. These variations and associ ated issues will be discussed in detail in the next chapter. Declining the Gambit: Other 2nd Moves After 1 d4 d5 2 c4, the argument for playing 2 ...e6 gains force when one investigates less played responses to 2 c4 which don't imprison Black's bishop on c8. This book is not encyclo paedic and I certainly won't analyse many side-variations in detail. But in this case it's ex tremely valuable to examine the ideas associ ated with those deviations from both 2 ... e6 and 2 ...c6, including their good points and the prob lems that accompany them. In each case, Black wants to keep the c8-bishop's path open and leave the c6-square free for his knight on b8. These lines are terribly instructive and hope fully useful. Marshall Defence
1 d4 d5 2 c4 tl:lf6 (D)
What could be simpler? Black develops a piece, defends the pawn on d5, and leaves the c8-bishop with a clear path to the outside world. It's interesting that if you show this posi tion to even fairly experienced players and ask how they would proceed, many will react by suggesting 3 cxd5 tl:lxd5 4 e4, which certainly is natural: White thereby forms the ideal centre with the gain of a tempo. Then if Black plays 4 ...tl:lf6, the obvious response is 5 tl:lc3 (5 e5 tl:ld5 leaves Black comfortably placed on the
QUEEN'S GAMBIT DECLINED 13
ideal blockading square in front of White' s backward pawn). Up to this point, White has done everything logically and correctly, but Black can fight back with S ...eS ! (D). This changes the central equation, as every advanced player will recognize from similar positions in several openings. Play might con tinue, for example, 6 dxeS (6 dS ..tcS allows free and easy development for Black's pieces) 6 ...�xdl + 7 'lt>xdl (7 tl:lxdl tl:lxe4) 7 ...tl:lg4, threatening the pawns on f2 and eS with a complex fight ahead in which Black has fully fledged play. Also, for the record, S ..td3 has a couple of drawbacks, the straightforward one being S ... tl:lc6 with pressure on the centre. Then Black is well developed following 6 dS tl:leS or 6 tl:lf3 ..tg4. Also possible but less clear is the temporary pawn sacrifice S ...eS ! ? 6 dxeS tl:lg4. So is 2 ... tl:lf6 the solution to the Queen's Gambit? Alas, it turns out that there is a better move than 4 e4. Simply 4 tl:lf3 ! gains the advan tage, since it stops ...eS and truly threatens S e4. Then the only efficient way for Black to pre vent that move and still remain competitive in the centre is 4 ... ..tfS (the dubious move 4 ...fS?! creates a big outpost on eS for White' s pieces, at the same time restricting the range of that c8-bishop Black was trying so hard to free). But 4 ... ..tfS can be met by S �3 ! and it is awkward for Black to defend b7; for example, S ...b6
(S ...
tl:lb6 allows 6 tl:lc3 with e4 to come next) 6 tl:lbd2. White has won the central battle. This time e4 cannot be stopped, as can be seen from an instructive line after 6 ... tl:lf6 (D):
7 e4 ! tl:lxe4 (7 ...
..txe4 8 tl:lxe4 tl:lxe4 9 tl:leS not only threatens checkmate, but also .tbs+ and sometimes �f3) 8 tl:leS ! tl:ld6 (the only real move, since 8 ...e6 9 .tbs+ is too strong) 9 .tbs+ (also good is 9 tl:lxf7 !? tl:lxf7 10 �f3, but that is messier) 9 ...c6 10 tl:lxc6 �d7 1 1 tl:lxa7 tl:lxbS 12 tl:lxbS and White has an extra pawn and good development. What's the lesson behind the apparently lucky forcing moves at White's disposal (7 e4! and 8 tl:leS !) in this last variation? In the 1 d4 openings, a recurring theme is that an early move by Black's bishop from c8 may be met by attacking the squares that the bishop has just abandoned, usually by the move �b3 threaten ing the pawn on b7, and sometimes by �a4. This occurs, for example, in many Slav and Queen's Gambit Exchange variations (and we see it in many other openings, including some beginning with 1 e4). The situation with re versed colours can elicit the same response; for example, when White plays 1 d4 tl:lf6 2 ..tgS (the Trompowsky), Black often replies ... cS to get ... �b6 in. The same ...cS (or, sometimes,

...c6) idea comes up in the Torre Attack (with j_g5), London System (with j_f4), the Veresov Attack ( 1 d4 d5 2 tl:lc3 tl:lf6 3 j_g5), several variations of the King's Indian Defence, and a host of other openings. The fact that 4 tl:lf3 was clearly superior to 4 e4 in this simple example illustrates that White needs to refrain from occupying the centre with his pawns until he is sure that those pawns can not be attacked to good effect. For instance, Black may be able to compel White's centre pawns to advance, or get the opportunity to ex change one or both of them. The problem is ob vious enough, but often White's decision is not an easy one to make. This basic situation will arise throughout the openings that we are study ing. Baltic Defence
1 d4 d5 2 c4 j_f5 (D)
Rather than defend d5, Black can directly develop with this bishop move, known as the Baltic Defence or sometimes the Keres De fence. Black's idea is simple: he would like to play the move ...e6, but wants to get his bishop out in front of his own pawns first. We have empha sized that after 2 ... e6, the c8-bishop can be a passive piece. So why not develop it first, espe cially to a nice active post? Well and fine, but White still has his idea of cxd5, and if Black plays ... �xd5, he wins a tempo against Black's queen by tl:lc3 (perhaps followed by e4). Alter natively, we know already that early moves by Black's c8-bishop can sometimes be met by �3 with an attack on the b7-square. Both of these themes arise after the following two moves: a) 3 cxd5 (White chooses a gentle way to proceed, immediately establishing a central ma jority of pawns) 3 ... j_xbl (this capture is Black's idea, so as to prevent White from achieving the powerful centre that would arise after 3 ... �xd5 4 tl:lc3, when e4 will follow, even after 4 ...�e6 5 f3) 4 �a4+ (4 �xbl �xd5 attacks White's pawn on a2, so White interpolates this check) 4 ...c6 (4 ...�d7 5 �xd7+ tl:lxd7 6 �xbl leaves White with the bishop-pair and central major ity; for example, 6 ...tl:lgf6 7 j_d2 tl:lxd5 8 e4 tl:l5f6 9 f3) 5 �xbl �xd5 6 f3 (D). Without looking at the theory of this position in depth, we can see how powerful White's cen tre is about to become if Black waits a move and permits White to play e4. Then White's two bishops will rule the board. So let's briefly look over Black's most obvious continuation: 6 ... e5 (note that when playing against the two bishops and with no weaknesses in the position, Black usually wants to transform the pawn-structure and create opportunities for his knights; among several other variations favouring White are 6 ... tl:ld7 7 e4 tl:lb6 8 exd5 tl:lxa4 9 dxc6 bxc6 10 j_d3 ! and 6 ... tl:lf6 7 e4 tl:lxe4 8 j_c4 �f5 9 fxe4 �xe4+ 10 tl:le2 �xbl 1 1 �b3 ! with various threats including 12 �xb7 and 1 2 j_d3 �al 1 3 O-O; in the latter case Black's queen won't es cape) 7 dxe5 tl:ld7 8 j_f4 tl:lc5?! (8 ... tl:lxe5 9 e4)
9 e4 ! �d7 10 �c4 �d8 1 1 j_e2 with an extra
pawn and the bishop-pair. The basic idea here is that unless some tactic by Black changes the overall dynamic of the game, White's centre
QUEEN'S GAMBIT DECUNED 15
and two bishops will grant him the long-term advantage. b) Even though 3 cxd5 gave White the ad vantage, much more aggressive is 3 �b3 ! (D), following the rule that when Black's bishop moves from c8, look at attacks on the queenside first. In fact 3 �b3 seems to be a virtual refutation of the Baltic (with the usual disclaimer that anything can change). Since the play that en sues is essentially tactical (and rather chaotic), it isn't particularly instructive to demonstrate all the details. Nevertheless, we have a situation in which capturing a pawn on b7 is followed by aggressive use of White's queen rather than a retreat to safety. This is a theme enunciated at various points in this book. So I shall show only the theoretically most critical move 3 ...e5 ! ? (Black lashes out with aggressive intent; he has the usual problems that crop up when his early sortie by the c8-bishop is met by �b3; for ex ample, 3 ... tZ'lc6? 4 cxd5 tZ'lxd4 ?? loses to 5 �a4+; instead, 3 ... b6 4 cxd5 tZ'lf6 5 tZ'lc3 e6 6 ..tg5 keeps White a clear pawn ahead; and still worse is 3 ... �c8? 4 cxd5 tZ'lf6 5 f3 ! with e4 next) 4 �xb7 tZ'ld7 5 tZ'lc3 ! exd4 (these moves are hard to improve upon; for example, 5 ... dxc4
6 e4 exd4 7 tZ'ld5 �b8 8 tZ'lxc7+ �e7 9 �c6) 6
tZ'lxd5 ..td6 and now 7 tZ'lf3 ! (D) is simpler and more effective than 7 e4!?, although in my opinion both moves ultimately lead to winning games. A critical variation goes 7 ... tZ'lc5 8 tZ'lxc7+ �xc7 (8 .... .txc7 9 �b5+) 9 �xa8+ �e7 10 �d5 ..te6 1 1 �xd4 tZ'lf6 1 2 b4! and wins. No tice how keeping the queen in the enemy camp disturbed Black' s development. I discussed this in Volume 1. Albin Counter-Gambit
1 d4 dS 2 c4 e5!?
This is another counterattacking defence that refuses to acknowledge the need to defend against cxd5. It is a more serious challenge to the Queen's Gambit than the second moves of the preceding two variations. Black sacrifices a pawn following 3 dxe5 d4! and hopes that the cramping effect of his advanced pawn will limit White's pieces while giving him freer de velopment. There normally follows 4 tZ'lf3 tZ'lc6
(D).
Unlike the 2nd-move variations seen above, White has neither an ideal centre nor tactical threats. But he does have an extra pawn and good development. White has a choice between
5 g3 and 5 tZ'lbd2 (moves like 5 a3 are also
played but held in lesser regard). This is not a
16 MASTERING THE CHESS OPENINGS
theoretical tome, but it' s my opinion (and al most all theoreticians and players concur) that Black will not quite achieve full compensation. The reasons for this are concrete and explicable only by investigating the actual variations. But one way of thinking about it is that White, hav ing the privilege of the first move and relatively logical places to put his pieces, is likely to achieve one advantage or another if and when Black takes time to regain his pawn, whereas White's position is sufficiently solid and free of weaknesses that he should be able to resist a brute-force attack. Nevertheless, this verdict is hardly etched in stone given the activity of Black's pieces. There is in fact no fundamen tal chess principle that ensures the superiority of either 2 ...e5 or 2 ...e6, in spite of their oppos ing characters. What are each side's strategies in the Albin Counter-Gambit? In general (but not always) Black's chances lie with a direct kingside at tack (versus 5 g3, for example, he can play ... .te6/f5/g4, ... �d7, ...
O-O-O, ...
..th3 and ...h5- h4), or with a central initiative usually associ ated with ...O-O-O and ...d3 or .. .f6. Recently, Black's attention has turned to ... ll:lge7-g6. For White, a variation that promises an advantage, albeit a limited one, begins with 5 ll:lbd2, when White has ideas of attacking the d4-pawn by means such as ll:lbd2-b3 and/or b4 and .tb2; this is causing Black some problems at present. White's oldest and most popular plan is to de velop by 5 g3 followed by 6 .tg2 and 7 O-O. Then, after Black commits to ... O-O-O, White can attack via b4, often playing this as a pawn sacrifice to open queenside lines. One standard attacking idea for White involves moves like b5 and �a4. The move b4 may also support the simple idea of .tb2 and ll:lb3, attacking Black's d-pawn. Versus ... .tg4, ...�d7 and ...O-O-O, White will often play the move �b3 (without b4) to gain threats against Black's vulnerable b7-square. All this is time-consuming, how ever, and the simple ... ll:lge7-g6 plan challenges its effectiveness. Naturally there are other strategies for both sides. In this sort of position featuring attacks and forcing moves, there is no substitute for careful study, which requires independent re search. I won't be able to guide you through that maze, but here are a couple of excerpts, beginning with the traditional 1 d4 d5 2 c4 e5 3 dxe5 d4 4 ll:lf3 ll:lc6 5 g3: a) The old main line was 5 ... .tg4 6 .tg2 �d7, as in Kozlovskaya-Mosionzhik, USSR 197 1 : 7 a3 ! ?

Of course it's entirely unclear who was better after 10 ...g5 or, indeed, earlier in the game. Needless to say, these examples are merely indicative of typical themes rather than best play. Chigorin Defence
1 d4 d5 2 c4 tt:Jc6 (D)
The Chigorin Defence is increasingly popu lar and is currently considered a legitimate at tempt to gain equality. It could even command its own section because the positional and stra tegic themes associated with it are so varied. Right away we can see that 2 ... tt:Jc6 is unique in that it both develops a piece and attacks White' s d-pawn. That means that the positional threat set up by 2 c4, that is, 3 cxd5 �xd5 4 lbc3, doesn't work after 2 ...lbc6 3 cxd5 �xd5 4 lbc3? because of 4 ... �xd4. Black's 2nd move also sets up the advance 3 ... e5. A primary idea behind the Chigorin is rapid development: Black will rush his bishops to squares like g4 and b4, his king's knight to f6 or e7, and he will castle rapidly, either kingside or queenside. This is of ten necessary because White will have played cxd5 at some early point to gain a central ma jority and, given time to breathe, will march his centre pawns forward to drive away Black's pieces. In many lines Black needs to pin and/or capture knights on c3 and f3 in order to stop this expansion from taking place or at least delay it. For example, after 3 cxd5 �xd5 4 e3 e5 5 lbc3, Black has given himself the opportunity for 5 ....fi.b4 and can maintain the queen on d5. Or, after 3 tt:Jf3 (renewing the idea of 4 cxd5 �xd5 5 lbc3), Black will play 3 .....tg4, and if 4 cxd5, 4 ....fi.xf3 5 gxf3 �xd5 follows, when again 6 lbc3? loses the d-pawn. Therefore White might play 6 e3, threatening 7 lbc3 for real, but after 6 ... e5, Black is once more ready for 7 lbc3 ilb4. Such a strategy has two main problems. It of ten necessitates the exchange of one or both bishops for knights, thus presenting White with the bishop-pair. Moreover, as described, White will gain a central majority at some point; in combination with two bishops, mobile pawns can be devastating. For example, this pairing of two bishops and broad centre just about invali dates the Baltic Defence, as described above (of course the Baltic also has tactical problems).
18 MASTERING THE CHESS OPENINGS
The difference here is a matter of specifics and timing. In the Chigorin, Black is normally able to inflict weaknesses in White' s position as the play develops. If not, his lead in develop ment can sometimes produce attacking chances or force advantageous transformations of the pawn-structure. Here are some game excerpts representing a small fraction of Chigorin Defence themes. As with any aggressive system, specific study of variations is necessary if you don't want to be rudely surprised. We' ll start with the classic Pillsbury-Chi gorin, St Petersburg 1 895, hardly the latest the ory but with a few nice ideas from the man whose name the defence bears: 1 d4 d5 2 c4 tl:lc6 3 tl:lf3 .tg4 4 cxd5 .txf3 5 dxc6 .txc6 6 tl:lc3 e6 7 e4 .tb4 8 f3 f5 (D). 9 e5? !

The culmination of a typical Chigorin De fence light-square strategy. After 1 8 .td2 tl:lb6 19 �c2 �xd4 20 �c l .td3 21 �3 tl:lc4, Black went on to win. Kasparov-Smyslov, Vilnius Ct ( 1 1 ) 1 984 shows us the flip side. White's strategy is sim ple: take over the centre and attack with the bishops ! 1 d4 d5 2 tl:lf3 tl:lc6 3 c4 .Bg4 4 cxd5 .txf3 5 gxf3 �xd5 6 e3 e5 7 tl:lc3 .Bb4 8 .td2 .txc3 9 bxc3 �d6 10 �bl b6 (D). It looks as though White's centre can't ad vance but Kasparov found the idea 1 1 f4 ! ? exf4 12 e4, establishing a powerful centre. White also has two very active bishops, but he is a pawn down. The game continued 12 ... tl:lge7 13 �f3 O-O 14 .txf4 �a3?!

As shown in the notes, however, Black could probably have equalized before White achieved a winning position. We get a slightly more up-to-date look in Flear-Miladinovic, Athens 1 999: l d4 d5 2 c4 tl:lc6 3 cxd5 �xd5 4 e3 e5 5 tl:lc3 .tb4 6 ..td2 .txc3 7 .txc3 exd4 8 tl:le2 (over the last few years, this position has occurred more than any other in the Chigorin) 8 ... tl:lf6 9 tl:lxd4 O-O 10 tl:lb5 �g5 !

An other case of very rapid development on Black's part, in this instance in return for a pawn. Don't forget the bishops and centre. Wells Shannon, Hastings 1988/9 makes the point again: 1 d4 d5 2 c4 tl:lc6 3 tl:lf3 .tg4 4 cxd5 .txf3 5 gxf3 �xd5 6 e3 e5 7 tl:lc3 .tb4 8 .td2 .txc3 9 bxc3 exd4 10 cxd4 tl:lge7 1 1 l::i. gl O-O?

1 d4 d5 2 c4 e6. As an introduction to the main
lines analysed in this chapter, we'll walk through the first moves. 3 tl:lc3 (D) This is White's most obvious and natural continuation, increasing his control over the key squares d5 and e4.
20 MASTERING THE CHESS OPENINGS
Move-order issues permeate the Queen's Gambit Declined. As I wrote this chapter, it got more and more cluttered with move-order sub tleties. I felt that they shouldn't interfere too greatly with the presentation of the most impor tant material, especially keeping in mind that many readers may be unfamiliar with the open ing. Nevertheless I have to address a limited set of options over the next few moves, especially if they involve elementary moves that you should avoid if you want to play a particular variation that I've written about. I think that most moder ately experienced players will appreciate hav ing some guideposts as we move towards the actual systems that we'll be examining. For a more thorough treatment, I have placed an extra section at the end of this chapter that deals with the more complex details. It talks about what transpositions and independent paths can result from playing one order of moves or another, even if they seem to be heading for the same position. Experienced players may wish to take a look at that section if they need clarifi cation about this or that path through the jungle. However, I want to emphasize that you can skip all of the explanations about move-orders and not worry about them until after you've read the meat of this chapter. They may not be so vital until you have played the Queen's Gambit Declined for a while as White or as Black. If it's a question of doing so or giving up on this wonderful and instructive opening, by all means jump ahead to the section 'Early Commitment' below, or even 'Classical Varia tions' below that. All right, let's jump into some whys and wherefores. Many players like the Exchange Variation of the Queen's Gambit when they're playing White; in fact, it is the most popular choice of all against the Queen's Gambit. That variation normally begins with 3 tl:lc3 tl:lf6 4 cxd5 exd5. Is there any reason why White wouldn't want to play the immediate 3 cxd5 exd5 (D) instead? The answer is that from the resulting position White cannot force a transpo sition into that form of Exchange Variation. This requires a fairly complicated digres sion. To repeat, the sequence actually called the Exchange Variation begins 1 d4 d5 2 c4 e6 3 tl:lc3 tl:lf6 4 cxd5 exd5 and has its own lengthy section in this chapter (in fact, the move 5 j_g5 is also part of what some call the traditional Ex change Variation). But if White tries to get to that position by 3 cxd5 exd5 4 tl:lc3, Black can choose moves other than 4 ... tl:lf6. The most useful of these is probably 4 ...c6. Then of course White cannot play 5 i.g5 ?? without losing the bishop. But the alternate bishop move 5 j_f4 hasn't much punch, because Black can oppose the bishop by 5 ... j_d6 if he wants to. Another perfectly satisfactory move for Black after 5 j_f4 is 5 ... j_f5. What if, after 3 cxd5 exd5 4 tl:lc3 c6, White rejects 5 j_f4 and plays the natural move 5 tl:lf3? This still isn't ideal for someone who likes the white side of the main lines of the Ex change Variation, because after 5 tl:lf3, Black has a good move in 5 ... j_f5, and then if White plays 6 �b3, Black can comfortably answer by 6 ...�b6. By comparison, you might ask why 5 ... j_f5 isn't a good move in our 'real' Ex- change Variation above (1 d4 d5 2 c4 e6 3 tl:lc3 tl:lf6 4 cxd5 exd5 5 j_g5); the answer is that White can play 6 �b3 ( D ):
B
QUEEN'S GAMBIT DECLINED 21
Then he attacks the pawn on b7 and threat ens .i.xf6 to win the pawn on d5. So it seems as though the best move to get to the Exchange Variation is to play 3 lll c3. But about playing 3 lllf3 ( D )? Players frequently get to this and related po sitions via other move-orders. For example, the opening might go 1 d4 'll f6 2 c4 e6, and White may not want to play 3 lll c3 because he'll have to go up against 3 ... .i.b4, the Nimzo-Indian De fence. This is the feeling of many strong mas ters, whose solution is to play 3 'll f3. Then Black in tum may want to play 3 ... d5, transpos ing to a form of the Queen's Gambit below. No tice that if you're playing Black and you like the Nimzo-Indian Defence, this can be an effective move-order, because it gets White to commit his knight to f3, a move which is generally less feared if Black now plays 3 ... d5. But is there any drawback to that strategy? Let's see. After
1 d4 d5 2 c4 e6 3 ll:lf3, Black will play 3 ...
lllf6 ( D) here most of the time. In the Move-Orders section at the end of this chapter, I've gone into a lot of detail about the differences between having played lllc3 or 'll f3. The most important thing to understand is that if you get to the Exchange Variation, it would probably be in the following way: 4 lllc3 .i.e7 5 cxd5 exd5 6 .i.g5 O-O 7 e3 c6 (D). White's knight is committed to f3. I'll refer to this as the 'Carlsbad Variation' (the corre sponding pawn-structure is called the 'Carls bad pawn-structure' or 'Carlsbad formation'). There's nothing wrong with this position, as we'll see, but having the knight on f3 has limited White's freedom of choice. We'll look at this po sition at great length in the Exchange Variation section later on. Many players as White prefer to develop their king's knight from g l to e2, and now they've lost that option. There's more to think about when White plays the order 3 lllf3 'll f6 4 lllc3; Black can even avoid the Exchange Variation altogether, without having to concede much. I've said a lit tle about that below. 3 .•• lll f6 (D) This is the move that we shall look at first. It has easily been the most common choice for Black over the years. 19th-century practice of 1 d4 d5 by the world's best players usually led to this position, and in fact to the positions stem ming from both sides' next few moves. The only other move that was employed fairly con sistently was 3 ... c5 (the Tarrasch Variation), al though it was put under a bit of a cloud for some time by 4 cxd5 exd5 5 lll f3 lllc6 and now Rubinstein's move 6 g3. That's still the line that most dissuades Black from the Tarrasch. Only
22 MASTERING THE CHESS OPENINGS
much later, particularly since the 1960s, was 3 ... lll f6 challenged in terms of effectiveness by 3 ... i.e7, an important variation called the 'Ala- tortsev' which is examined in its own section. 4 i.g5 White heads for the traditional main line, which goes 4 i.g5 i.e7 5 e3 O-O 6 'll f3. Instead 4 cxd5 exd5 5 i.g5 is finally the 'real' Ex change Variation, which we'll be looking at carefully later. As I described above, 4 lll f3 ( D) is an impor tant move-order for a couple of reasons. First, it arises via 3 lllf3 lllf6 4 lllc3 as well. Again I'll refer you to the Move-Orders sec tion at the end of this chapter for a lengthier dis cussion. But there are a couple of points that you might find useful: a) After 4 lll f3, Black can choose to play 4 ... dxc4. This introduces the Vienna Variation, which is a very complex opening. You may want to consider playing that as Black. As White, you can't avoid the V ienna V ariation if you play ll:lf3 and lllc3 on the 3rd and 4th moves. That probably means you'll want to put a little study time into it, as explained at the end of the chapter. b) I should also point out that Black can still prevent White from getting into any kind of true Exchange Variation by fiddling with move orders. For example, after 4 lllf3, Black can play 4 ... i.e7, and if 5 cxd5 exd5 6 i.g5, then Black plays 6 .. . c6 with the idea 7 e3 i.f5. That is probably easier for Black to play than the true Exchange Variation. On the other hand, by using that order (1 d4 d5 2 c4 e6 3 'llc3 ll:lf6 4 lllf3 i.e7), Black does allow 5 i.f4, an important variation that I won't be covering in detail but will touch upon at the end of the chapter. So much for early move-orders. We can't avoid the transpositions from one line to an other, but at least you've got the basics. Now let's continue stepping through our main line -we return to 4 i.g5 (D):

4 ... i.e7 Black unpins the knight. We'll look quickly at some weaker moves: a) 4 ... h6? 5 i.xf6 creates serious problems for Black, who must either accede to the iso lated doubled pawns resulting from 5 .. . gxf6 6 cxd5 exd5, or lose a pawn by 5 ... 'iYxf6 6 cxd5 exd5 (6... c6 7 dxc6 lllxc6 8 ll:lf3) 7 'llxd5 'iYd6 8 e4, etc. b) Also favouring White is 4 ... c5?! 5 cxd5 cxd4 (5 ... exd5 6 i.xf6! gxf6 7 'llf3 and Black's pawn-structure is shattered while he's behind in development) 6 'iYxd4 i.e7 (6 ...

5 e3 (D)

In the famous position after 5 e3 we have a split in material and shall look at two moves for Black. Early Commitment 5 ...h6 This move is considered more accurate by some players and less so by others! It's true that 6 j,,xf6 is considered harmless at this point, so that it seems a good time to nudge White into committing to j,,h4. But one poten tially important difference is that now White can skip or delay the move 'll f3, as he does in what follows. 6 .lth4 O-O 7 .:!.cl (D) This move-order is a Korchnoi speciality, delaying 7 'll f3 (which would give us the main line Classical Queen's Gambit Declined, seen below). Finally we get to see a game! 7 ...b6!? Korchnoi - Short Rotterdam 1988 Black wants to play a fianchetto system. Af ter 7 .. . llle4 8 .ltxe7 'J/i/xe7, 9 lllxe4 dxe4 with ...e5 to come is OK for Black, but White can also play simply 9 lll f3 and we're back in the main line of the Lasker V ariation, something which we'll see in detail in just a moment. The problem is that Black may not like that line; a lot of players prefer not to initiate exchanges with ... llle4 since they'd like to use a system with ...b6 instead. 8 cxd5 lll xd5 After 8 ... exd5, 9 .ltd3 .ltb7 1 0 lllge2 .l:.e8 1 1 O-O and j,,g3 i s a good follow-up; that's a bit awkward for Black because the b7-bishop is running into its own pawn. You will find that in many openings with ...b6, cxd5 is an effective move for White. 9 lllxd5 exd5 10 j,,xe7 �xe7 11 j,,d3 (

A funny position. This strongly resembles the Tartakower Variation that I shall discuss later, but with options for White that don' t exist in that sequence, because he hasn't committed his knight to f3. 1 1. .. .ltb7
24 MASTERING THE CHESS OPENINGS
Hjartarson-Vaganian, Bundesliga 1990/1 took an instructive course after Black played the logical 1 1 ....lte6 1 2 llle2 c5 1 3 O-O 'll d7. Then 1 4 'll f4! grabbed a handy place for the knight, putting pressure on d5 but also retaining the op tion of lllxe6. The game continued 1 4 ... lllf6 1 5 dxc5 bxc5. Black has hanging pawns on c5 and d5, which Hj artarson proceeds to 'fix' (discour age from advancing) by his next move: 1 6 b3 a5 1 7 �c2 .l:.ac8 1 8 lllxe6 ! fxe6 19 e4 ! d4 20 'iYe2 e5 21 g3 @h7 22 f4 (D). In this type of position, Black's central ma jority is completely blocked whereas White's on the kingside is potentially mobile and c4 is a handy outpost in front of a backward pawn. The upshot is that White has the better of it, al though it takes a lot of work to make progress. 12 'lle2 White's knight development to e2 (instead of f3) means that the knight can go to f4 to put pressure on the d-pawn or even to g3 to worry Black on the kingside. 12• .. c5 13 O-O c4 Korchnoi-Spassky, Clermont-Ferrand 1989 went 1 3. .. ll:ld7 1 4 �a4 'll f6 1 5 dxc5 bxc5 1 6 �a3. That presents a standard QGD motif: Black's c-pawn is pinned and White will pile up on it. If and when Black moves it to c4, White gains the d4-square for his pieces, in particular his knight. In practice, Black sometimes gets queenside pressure down the b-file. The game continued 1 6 ... .l:.fc8 1 7 .l:i.c3 'll e4 1 8 .ltxe4 'iYxe4 19 'll g3 �e5 20 .l:.xc5 .l:.xc5 21 �xc5 �xb2 22 tllf5 (D).

You can actually ar gue that Black's problems trace back to 5 ... h6. That is a good move in general, but it happens to work better in conjunction with ... b6 if White has already played 'll f3. We shall see better versions of the queenside fianchetto below.
QUEEN'S GAMBIT DECUNED 25
Classical Variations 5 ... O-O 6 'll f3 We are at the first great dividing point that the Old Masters faced when playing the Classi cal Queen's Gambit Declined. They generally chose between the Lasker Variation (6. .. h6 7 .lth4 llle4) and the Capablanca/Orthodox Vari ation (6 ... 'll bd7 and in most cases . .. c6). Mod em players have tended to switch to various other systems as both White and Black, and the one that truly stands out is the Tartakower Vari ation (6 ... h6 7 j,,h4 b6), a line that existed on the margins of play in early times but exploded into prominence some 40 years ago and has re mained the most popular choice since. Lasker Defence 6 ... h6 (D) This move is a significant decision. Although it breaks the beginner's rule about moving a pawn in front of your king, 6 .. . h6 has at least two advantages: a) it provides an escape-square for Black's king on h7; b) it means that if White lines up his bishop on d3 and his queen on c2, Black won' t have to waste a tempo guarding his h-pawn. On the flip side, Black makes a weakness when he plays ... h6 and you never know how that might end up hurting him. We shall see other examples in which Black avoids ... h6, with ambiguous results. 7 j,, b4 7 .ltxf6 gives up the two bishops but gains time. This exchange occurs with loss of time versus ... b6 systems (Tartakower), for reasons that we'll describe later. After 7 .. . j,,xf6 (D), we'll often see Black free his game at the cost of exchanging one of his bishops. A high-level illustration went 8 �b3 c6 9 .l:i.dl 'll d7 1 0 i.d3 b6 1 1 cxd5 cxd5 1 2 e4 dxe4 1 3 j,,xe4 .l:.b8 1 4 O-O b5 1 5 .l:.fel �b6 1 6 .ltbl j,,b7 17 �c2 g6 18 d5 (initiating a mass liqui dation before his IQP becomes a problem) l 8 . . . exd5 l 9 'll xd5 j,,xd5 20 .l:.xd5 .l:i.fd8 1h-1h Kasparov-Karpov, Moscow Wch (3) 1985. 7 ••• ll:le4 (D) The first move of the Lasker Variation. Here we have one of the oldest defences in the Classi cal Queen's Gambit Declined complex. Study of such traditional lines is a great way to under stand not just l d4 d5 ideas but chess in general. With 7 . .. lll e4, Black uses a tempo (moving the knight again) to transform his position by
26 MASTERING THE CHESS OPENINGS
exchanging pieces. Normally you'd think that the resulting position would be much more cramped than the original - certainly Black hasn't done anything to solve his problem with the bishop on c8, while the bishop on e7 was a pretty good piece. But it turns out that the combination of a queen on e7 and knight on d7 can enforce the freeing advance ... e5, which will finally give that light-squared bishop some breathing room. The drawback to all this is that it takes time, and there's no reason why White can't mount an attack when there have been only two sets of minor pieces exchanged. 8 iLxe7 'flixe7 9 .:!.cl White develops his rook so as not to lose time with 9 .ltd3 lbxc3 1 0 bxc3 dxc4 11 iLxc4. This is only one of several moves. a) For some time it was thought that White could gain some advantage after 9 cxd5 lbxc3 1 0 bxc3 exd5 1 1 'flib3, but his lead in develop ment has vanished and his extra centre pawn is easily restrained. The main line goes 1 l .. . .l:i.d8 1 2 c4 (1 2 .lte2 has several answers, including 1 2 ... lbc6, eyeing the light squares via . .. lba5, as in the game) 1 2. .. dxc4 1 3 .ltxc4 (D).
B
An instructive position, because White has two central pawns to Black's none, and even potential pressure down the c-file. But he hasn't castled yet, often an issue in openings stemming from 1 d4. Here Black will develop quickly to harass White's pieces before he can get orga nized: 1 3 ... lbc6! (this threatens ... lba5; time is more important than structure) 1 4 'flic3 (the old move, to cover a5 and keep the bishop on c4; not much better is 1 4 ile2!? b6! 1 5 O-O .ltb7, or here 1 5. .. ile6 1 6 'flic3 .ltd5 also has its points; after that move Black can even think about challenging White's kingside by ... .l:.d6-g6) 1 4. .. .ltg4 (rapid development!) 1 5 O-O (1 5 .lte2 .ltxf3 forces 16 gxf3 anyway in view of 1 6 iLxf3? lbxd4) 1 5. .. ilxf3 1 6 gxf3 'flif6 17 .lte2 .l:i.ac8 18 .l:.ab l b6 19 .l:.fc l lbe7 ! 20 @hl .l:.d5 and in Karpov-Y usupov, London Ct (5) 1989 Black had no problems and even a modest at tack. b) 9 'flic2 is certainly natural, intending to stop . . .e5 cold after 9 ... lbxc3 1 0 'iYxc3, but then Black can play 1 0 ... dxc4 (1 0. .. lbc6!? is worthy of consideration) 1 1 iLxc4 c5! , his al ternative freeing move. Then White finally catches up in development by 1 2 O-O, and Black has time to protect his centre by 1 2 ... lbd7 with ...cxd4 and/or ... b6 to follow. Theory rates this as equal, but perhaps it's a place for White to in vestigate further in the hunt for a small advan tage. We now return to the position after 9 .l:i.c 1
(D):
9 ... c6 It seems strange to put more pawns on light squares. But this time we can easily grasp the idea: Black wants to play ... e5, so he has to pro tect the pawn on d5 first. More important is the manner in which he does it. White must now try to find a useful move, and capturing the knight by I 0 lbxe4 dxe4 1 1 lbd2 e5 ! has long been known to be equal. Instead, 9 ... lbxc3 1 0 .l:i.xc3 dxc4? 1 1 iLxc4 would leave White a valuable tempo ahead of the game. 10 .ltd3 lbxc3 11 .l:i.xc3 dxc4 12 iLxc4 1 2 .l:.xc4 is sometimes played, but that's a different story.
QUEEN'S GAMBIT DECLINED 2 7
1 2. . . 'lld7 1 3 O-O (D) At this point we'll look at two games, one a well-known classic of attack (with Black play ing 1 3 ... e5), and the other a typical old-style Queen's Gambit with positional manoeuvring (with Black playing 1 3 ... b6). Incidentally, Sad ler suggests 1 3 ... c5! ?. It's quite logical, and something to consider if Black's standard plans all come up short or you simply don't like them. Karpov - Yusupov London Ct (7) 1989 13 ... eS 14 .ltb3 (D) A multi-purpose move. The obvious idea is to avoid the potential sequence of ... e4 and . . . lll b6 with an attack on the valuable bishop on c4, followed by bringing out Black's c8-bishop, his problem piece. White also introduces a little threat. This can be seen by comparing the old line 1 4 dxe5 lllxe5 1 5 lllxe5 'iYxe5 1 6 f4 'iYe4, after which 1 7 j,,d3? ! allows 1 7. .. �xe3+; then lengthy analysis shows that Black can escape with his extra pawn. But with the bishop on b3, White threatens 1 5 dxe5 lllxe5 1 6 tllxe5 �xe5 1 7 f4, when l 7 ... �e4 could be answered by 1 8 .ltc2 followed by 19 e4 and t o great effect, since White's central majority would be mobilized. Needless to say, Black won't wait around for that to happen. 14 ...exd4 There have been a few games since this one in which Black tried to delay opening up the po sition so quickly. These alternatives may be playable but they have led to some attractive wins for White:

Then a great old example was Alekhine Rubinstein, Carlsbad 1923: 8 ...a6!? 9 a4!?

A modern-looking position! These d4/f4 structures, although still infrequent, have be come accepted in a greater number of situations than was the case 20 years ago. If White's d pawn disappears, he'll have a doubled f-pawn formation that typically arises in the Dutch Defence Stonewall variation and in various openings where Black plays ... ..tg4 (or ... ..tb7) followed by ... ..txf3 and White recaptures with the e-pawn. From Black's point of view, we see the same structure occurring in the main-line Slav ll'Bh4xf5 variations, and the Nimzo-Indian with ... �f5 and �xf5, among other openings. One of the ideas of allowing ... ll'Bxf4 is that White's central pawns will clamp down on the freeing move . . . e5. So naturally, Rubinstein looks to his other central break and counts upon his bishop-pair: 1 3. ..c5 14 dxc5 (a key point for understanding the opening: White will either concentrate upon the centre or kingside, de pending upon Black's reply) 14. ..�c7 ! ? (this is one of three ways to recover the pawn; by mov ing his queen, Black gets off the d-file, attacks the f4-pawn, and waits to see what White will do; other moves apparently fail to equalize; e.g., 14 ... ll'Bxc5 1 5 O-O �c7 16 ll'Be5 f6 1 7 ll'Bd3 tl'Bxd3 1 8 ..txd3 f5 l 9 ll'Bd5 ! or 14 ... ..txc5 1 5 O-O tl'Bf6 16 ll'Be5 �c7 17 ..td3, threatening ll'Be2) 15 O-O �xf4 16 ll'Be4 ll'Bxc5 17 ll'Bxc5 ..txc5 1 8 ..td3 b6?

. . . e5. One motivation for Capablanca' s Varia tion was to avoid certain orders in the Lasker Variation; for example, ones in which White exchanges on e4 after 6 ...h6 7 ..th4 tl'Be4, or the line in which White plays 8 ..txe7 Wixe7 9 cxd5 tl'Bxc3 10 bxc3 exd5 1 1 °iVh3. See the section on the Lasker Variation to make sense of that ex planation. As it turns out, however, neither of those ideas is particularly effective for White, so the relevant difference between the two vari ations has to do with the h-pawn, which is ei ther on h6 (in the Lasker Variation) or on h7 (in the Capablanca Variation). You'll see what I mean in the discussion about 1 1 O-O below. At this juncture I'll concentrate upon the unique move 1 1 tl'Be4 (A), with a briefer look at
1 1 O-O (B).

11 tl'Be4 (D) This was Alekhine's solution in his World Championship match versus Capablanca and later in a famous game versus Lasker. White's idea is to keep the pieces on and mobilize his centre later. It still has promise. 11• •. tl'i5f6 Black retreats in order to challenge White's knight. He still intends . . . e5 if possible. It is the best-known move. Black shouldn't play 1 1 ...e5?! immediately, if only because 1 2 O-O!

Further more, 1 1 ...Wib4+ 1 2 Wid2 Wixd2+ 1 3 'iit xd2!, from Alekhine-Capablanca, Buenos Aires W ch (6) 1927, is a thankless position for Black. This queenless middlegame features White's cen tralized king and mobile centre pawns, whereas Black hasn't solved the problem of his queen's bishop. And of course, Black's weakness at d6 doesn't help matters. Nevertheless, Black's position after 1 1 tl'Be4 is fundamentally sound, so arguably he can keep things in hand by l 1 .. .b6 with the simple idea . . . i.b7 and ...c5.

6 tl\f3 h6 7 i.h4 b6 (D) Now we are moving into a territory of more complex and usually more dynamic positions than we saw in the Lasker and Capablanca vari ations, which after all were aimed at exchang ing pieces and reaching some kind of simplified equality. After 7 ... b6 pieces tend to stay on the board longer, and the resulting unbalanced situ ation creates difficult and double-sided play. What is Black doing? It's not so mysterious, at least not to begin with. He'll play . . . i.b7, shor ing up d5. That allows him to play for the freeing move ...c5, often prepared by ... tl'ibd7. Notice that the move 7 ...c5?! straightaway would ex pose the unprotected status of d5 after 8 dxc5 i.xc5 9 cxd5 exd5 10 �c l (for example), when Black will have to take up a passive position merely to hold on to his material. By playing ... b6 and . . . i.b7 first, the move ...c5 will defi nitely be on the cards, and ... tl'Be4 at the right moment can also be effective. White has a large number of strategies rang ing from simple exchanges to exertion of long term pressure by clamping down upon any free ing move by Black, especially ...c5. In almost all cases White restrains his own aggressive ness until Black's position is under control. It turns out that Black can answer this method of play in two very different ways. In many lines Black is the one trying to mix things up; he wants to do this before falling into some kind of static disadvantage. This can involve pawn sac rifices for activity and other tactical devices.
36 MASTERING THE CHESS OPENINGS
However, in a majority of variations he will gain the bishop-pair, so that gives him a choice: he can still look for energetic unbalancing moves but he also has the option of consolidat ing his position before slowly opening up the game on the bishops' behalf. In those cases it may be White who undertakes a vigorous ad vance before he loses the long-run battle. It is this unpredictability and potential dynamism that attracts players to the Tartakower Variation. In order to gain familiarity with the positions, and to achieve some depth of understanding, rll concentrate on just a few of both players' set-ups by looking at a series of games. Fortu nately, the ideas cross over into other lines of the Tartakower, and of the Queen's Gambit in general. The Older Exchange Line 8 cxd5 This is the older move, which received a lot of attention before it began to appear that White might get better chances by complicating the situation instead. Nevertheless, some players still use 8 cxd5, and very rich positions can re sult.
8...
tllxd5! (D) Here is the move that helped to revive the Tartakower Defence. 8 ...exd5 is playable but more rigid; according to theory White keeps the better of it. Compare the Exchange Variation below, in which ... b6 isn't optimal. 9 .i.xe7 'flxe7 10 tllxd5 I O �cl i.b7 has always been considered harmless because Black can assault White's central majority by . . .c5 before it gets rolling; for example, 1 1 i.d3 l:.c8 1 2 O-O c5 1 3 �e2 tllxc3 14 l:.xc3 tlld7 with equality, Keres-Pet rosian, Cura�ao Ct 1 962. 10 •..exdS 11 l:.cl .i.e6! (D) This is a major idea in the Tartakower. Once Black has a pawn fixed on d5 blocking the long diagonal, the bishop would usually be poorly placed on b7; therefore in many situations Black will put it on e6 where it has some open lines and doesn't get in the way of his queenside pieces. Specifically, after the advance . . . c5, the bishop encourages rooks to come to b8 and c8 in support of the idea of ...c4 and . . . b5; this makes use of Black's queenside majority. You will see a bishop heading for e6 in a great num ber of games with this defence. In fact, the re routing manoeuvre ... .i.b7-c8-e6 is a recurrent theme! 12 'fla4 White delays castling in order to meet ... c5 with 'fla3, pinning the pawn. 12 'fla4 also eyes the somewhat weakened light squares in Black's camp, namely a6 and c6. Notice that if White plays tlle5 next, all four of his active pieces will be attacking one or both of those squares. 12• . • cS We'll look at two games in the position after 1 2. ..c5: Mamedyarov - Lputian Tripoli FIDE KO 2004 13 dxc5 bxc5 14 'fla3 l:.c8 (D) Before moving on, let's take a quick look at this pawn-structure, which is characteristic of
QUEEN'S GAMBIT DECUNED 3 7
many Tartakower variations (although there are usually more pieces on the board). As we discussed in Chapter 3 of Volume 1 , Black' s c5- and d5-pawns are called 'hanging pawns' . Whether they are good or bad depends upon how well protected they are, how mobile they are, and what activity can be generated around them. In this kind of position White wants to restrain the advance of the pawns for the mo ment and then target them, much as one fights against an isolated pawn. For this purpose he has pinned Black' s pawn on c5 and can in crease the pressure on it down the c-file. The move ...d4 isn't on the cards (yet), and an im portant idea (executed in the Fischer-Spassky game below) will be to force one pawn to ad vance so as to blockade both. Black's position has its own good points. The c5-square is well defended, and Black will normally play ... tl'Bd7 to reinforce its protection. Then the b-file can be a real asset. Black can ap proach the situation in two ways: a) he can try to attack White's b-pawn down the open file and provoke the move b3, after which ...a5-a4 or ...a5 and . . . 'i¥b7-b4 is possi ble; or b) he can simply play ...c4 without provoca tion because, although that permanently gives up the d4-square, it also discourages the move b3 and facilitates an attack down the b-file. You'll see these ideas in more than one line of the Tartakower Defence. 15 i.e2 as 16 tl'Bd4 Also a standard idea. The knight can go to b3 in order to put pressure on Black's c-pawn, or in some cases White will exchange the bishop on e6. Now Black plays a surprising move: 16• .• tl'Ba6! 17 ..txa6 Else the knight comes to b4.

colour. What' s the point? Essentially it's that Black' s bishop is poorly placed for this pawn structure. It was actually better on c8, so the reasoning goes. And as we mentioned above, Black's bishop very often retreats from b7 to c8 and then (usually) goes to e6. So White in that case has gained one move by taking two moves to capture the knight! In the meantime, why is White giving up the bishop-pair? Essentially, he feels that it' s a sufficiently controlled posi tion that he can use his well-placed knights to make progress, probably with a pawn advance before Black' s bishops find good homes for themselves. Black on the other hand thinks that as long as his queenside pawn-structure can't be compromised by White (by means of b4-b5, for example), and as long as the advance e4 isn't effective, he will be able to open the game at his discretion and use the bishop-pair to his advan tage. It' s easiest to understand this by exam ples:

The main line, which is now used by a large majority of masters. White tries to hold down . . .c5 and also prepares a minority attack by b5 in some positions. There are several fascinating alternatives ( I I °i¥b3, for example) that you may find it interesting to research for yourself. I think that it is more useful, however, to see 1 1 b4 in depth.

Setting up the pawns in this fashion is now a standard idea. You wouldn't think that Black would want to close up the position for his own bishops, but he does have the nice outpost on c4 in return for White's on c5, and he can bring his bad bishop around to f5. Perhaps most sig nificantly, his weaknesses are masked and not likely to become a problem soon; remember that third-rank weaknesses are usually easier to defend than ones on the fourth rank. In this game it all works perfectly: 1 7 tt:'iel ?! tt:'Bb6 1 8 tt:'Bd3 .tc8 ! 1 9 tt:'Bc5 .tf5 20 .l:i.al .te7 ! 2 1 .l:i.a2 .l:i.xa2 22 'iVxa2 .td6 (this is the same manoeuvre that seems to work in all of our Exchange Vari ation pawn-structures !

Black often chooses this move because he wants to avoid the Modem Exchange Variation (discussed forthwith).

This line, with the knight commit ted to f3, is sometimes called the 'Carlsbad Variation' . As we shall see in the Exchange Variation section, White' s modem set-up with .td3 and tt:'ige2 is the one that many players fear most, and that is bypassed by the sequence 3 ... .te7 4 tt:'Bf3. Originally this move-order 'trick' was only used by grandmasters, but now even moderately experienced players are familiar with it; the fact is that a lot of players who use the Queen's Gam bit Declined as their regular defence don't like facing the Modem Exchange Variation. Of course, White isn't forced to cooperate by playing 4 tt:'Bf3. He can exchange on d5 and then develop his pieces independently thereafter, as more than one World Champion has done.

There could hardly be anything more natural than to place a bishop on f4, especially when .ltg5 isn't available.

6 'iVc2 In the next two games we shall see 6 e3 .tf5. White sometimes develops the queen first in or der to stop ... .tf5. In turn, Black wants to get that move in so that he can develop (and per haps exchange) his bad bishop. Thus his next move.

White can exchange bishops by 8 .td3, but then Black has achieved his goal and isn't under the slightest risk of attack.

White doesn't want Black's knight settling in on e4. What's more, f3 prepares g4 in some cases so as to gain space and drive away Black's bishop. 9 ...c5?! It's hard to believe that this move in combi nation with the next constitutes a positional mistake, but perhaps Black should be more pa tient. The straightforward 9 ... h5, stopping g4 (as well as .th6), was played ten years later in Topalov-Karpov, Wijk aan Zee 1 998. That game continued 10 .td3 .txd3 1 1 'iVxd3 tt:'Ba6 1 2 tt:'ige2 tt:'Bc7 1 3 O-O tt:'Be6 14 .te5 and it' s fair to say that White has some advantage; Topalov went on to win.

This exchange turns out to hurt Black badly, both on the e-file and on the kingside.

This doesn't look good for Black. For start ers, White's queen protects his bishop on h6, so that it is ready to take over that square after a possible exchange.

Yet we saw in a note above that as White he got the better of Kasparov in the same line. In Linares 1 989, he also used 7 g4 to defeat Portisch. Al though it's not fair to speak of a forced advan tage, Black has yet to prove that he can equalize completely against White's strategy.

Here I'd like to fill out some variations that we've missed.

White's most aggressive approach (and Black's most confrontational reply) is 5 e4 tt:'Bxc3 6 bxc3 c5 7 tt:'Bf3 (this completes the transposition; 7 l:i.bl !? is interesting, to prevent . . . .ltb4+ in some lines; by targeting b7, White hinders the development of Black's queen's bishop) 7 ... cxd4 8 cxd4 .ltb4+ 9 .ltd2 .ltxd2+ 10 'iVxd2 (D). We've arrived at the starting point of many a famous battle. Most lower-ranked players don't like to concede the ideal centre to White, who can advance his central pawns to make a passed pawn or aim his forces at Black's king. But Black has no weaknesses and can think about taking over queenside light squares as he does in the Griinfeld Defence. The variation as a whole is probably more difficult for Black to play than for White. I won't discuss the line ex cept to show the famous example Polugaev sky-Tal, USSR Ch (Moscow) 1 969, in which

The threat is Clle7+ and if Black's rook strays, h6-h7 decides. Let's return to 4 ... exd5 (D): We've reached the Exchange Variation of the Queen's Gambit, written about in great detail in countless books and articles. One reason for this, perhaps even the main one, is that the im portant strategic ideas are so clear and defin able, and thus easy to write about. They can be presented in a relatively simple fashion or with more detail, depending upon the level of so phistication the writer wants to indulge in. The particular version of queenside minority attack that arises from the Exchange Variation, for ex ample, is the standard one given in almost ev ery textbook, with a host of well-known set-ups for both sides. However, the more carefully that you scrutinize the Exchange Variation, the more you appreciate the subtleties that inform its execution in practice. Right off, we see that in most variations none or only one pair of mi nor pieces is exchanged up to the start of the middlegame. Ordinarily, any opening with such properties allows for complex and original play. Most Tartakower Defence lines in the Classical Queen' s Gambit fit that description, and it is no coincidence that the Exchange and Tartakower are by far the two most popular QGD variations in modem grandmaster chess. We should start with the basics. Why would White free Black's light-squared bishop, his problem piece in the variations that we have ex amined thus far? Doesn't this negate the whole point of playing 2 c4? White gets the c-file, to be sure, but Black gets the e-file, arguably a more important one. I think the answers to this question are more accidental than logical. It turns out that in this precise position Black nor mally has no particularly good square for his liberated queen's bishop and must be satisfied with the passive move ... .lte6 (or - often worse - ...b6 and ... .ltb7). Why? In the first place White usually develops by .ltd3 and/or 'iVc2

and prevents ... i.f5, whereas ... i.g4 is either impossible, because one of the moves f3 or h3 has already been played, or undesirable, be cause the move f3 is extremely valuable even if Black' s bishop retreats to g6 via h5. The other strong point behind cxd5 is that now, if and when Black tries to attack White' s centre via . . .c5, he has to reckon with the idea of dxc5, isolating Black's d-pawn (this is especially true if White has occupied f3 with a knight and not a pawn). In most variations, the arrangement of Black' s pieces is not such that the isolated pawn is compensated for by his activity, as it so often is in other openings (in the Exchange Vari ation, for example, you will see a knight on d7 rather than the more active c6). Thus variables not already inherent in the pawn-structure, i.e., the particularities of piece dispositions, happen to favour White's otherwise illogical exchange on d5. Note that these are exceptional charac teristics that are not shared by other Exchange Variations, such as those in the French Defence ( 1 e4 e6 2 d4 d5 3 exd5 exd5) or the Slav ( 1 d4 d5 2 c4 c6 3 cxd5 cxd5). 5 i.g5 (D)
B
Actually, some writers call this the starting position of the Exchange Variation 'Proper' , because i.g5 is part of the standard set-up. At some point in the naming process, however, things become ambiguous and there's no point in fretting over subtleties. 5 ... i.e7 There are a number of other move-orders, but in this position the most significant alternatives tend to converge upon the positions and struc tures that follow. An important side-variation is 5 ... c6 6 e3 (6 'iVc2 prevents Black' s next, but that's another move that is associated with nu merous subvariations) 6 ... i.f5 7 'iVf3 ! i.g6 8 i.xf6 'iVxf6 9 'iVxf6 gxf6 (D). It looks ridiculous to allow White to get into an ending with Black having weak doubled pawns and no positive chances, but especially at master level there are players who don't nec essarily mind playing with a slightly worse po sition if they think they can ultimately achieve a drawn result. Fortunately most of us aren't like that; and anyway, in a real game there are al ways plenty of chances to win. The variation which seems to have the most promise for White at this point in time is 10 tt:'Bf3 tt:'Bd7 1 1 tt:'Bh4 (or 1 1 g3 followed by tt:'Bh4) 1 l ...tt:'Bb6 (Black in tends to play ... tt:'Bc8-d6 to protect the vulnerable f5-square) 1 2 g3; for example, 12 ... tt:'Bc8 1 3 f3 tt:'Bd6 14 '1ii> f2. This is a position in which Black will generally have to wait around while White can try several plans in order to make progress. An example with a different move-order but not radically different strategy is Van Wely-Short, Wijk aan Zee 2005: 1 0 tt:'Bf3 tt:'Bd7 1 1 tt:'Bh4 i.e7 1 2 g3 tt:'Bb6 1 3 f3 a5 14 @f2 a4 15 .l:i.c l tt:'Bc8 16 i.e2 tt:'Bd6 17 .l:i.hd 1 O-O 1 8 i.d3 .l:i.fe8 1 9 g4 i.f8 20 tt:'Be2 i.h6 2 1 f4 i.xd3 22 .l:!.xd3 i.f8 23 tt:'Bg3 .l:i.a5 24 .l:i.c2 .l:i.b5 25 tt:'ihf5 tt:'Bc4 26 b3 axb3 27 .l:i.xb3 .l:i.xb3 28 axb3 tt:'Ba5 29 tt:'Bh5 .l:!.e6 30 .l:i.a2 b6 31 .l:i.a4 1-0. Impressive, although naturally Black has alternatives. If he wants to enter into the 7 'iVf3 i.g6 line, Black should study what White's logical set-ups are and specifically how to respond to them. For his part, White has to decide whether to avoid the ending altogether in favour of more complex play.
QUEEN'S GAMBIT DECUNED 49
We now return to the position after 5 ... i..e7
(D):
6 e3 6 'iVc2 can be played here, perhaps to prevent an early ... i..f5. It's worth noting that in some variations with 'iVc2 and O-O-O soon thereafter, Black's most dangerous idea is to play ...c5, hopefully quickly, in order to exert pressure down the c-file and in some cases to put his knight on c6, where it is a bit closer to White's king. And there are other problems for White when he plays an early 'iVc2, particularly (but not limited to) situations in which he has devel oped his knight to f3: Black can play ...g6, with the idea of ... i..f5, gaining a tempo or exchang ing a good bishop on d3. Also, Black's knight will sometimes develop via a6, irritating White because of the possibility of ... tt:'Bb4 but also leaving open the manoeuvre ... tt:'Bc7-e6, which has the same result as the conventional route ... tt:'ibd7-f8-e6. For all that, Black can only try one plan at a time, and White has ways of trying to counter each one, so 6 'iVc2 is certainly play able. The following game isn't the most pertinent example of 'iVc2 ideas, but at least it begins that way. I present it for those of you who think that the Queen's Gambit Declined is boring. The ac tual move-order of this game is slightly differ ent from the one we've been following. Guseinov - Magomedov Dushanbe 1999

As noted, this combines the idea of . . . tt:'Bb4 with that of ... tt:'Bc7-e6, a standard cen tralization in the Exchange Variation. 8 a3 Before undertaking central action, White an ticipates Black's planned attack by ... g6, ... tt:'Bb4 and . . . i..f5. By stopping ... tt:'Bb4, however, he uses up a precious tempo.

Hence the retreat of the queen, which at least leads to complications.

(or c8) is whether a queen move to attack the opponent' s abandoned queenside can be effec tive. Even if it doesn't win a pawn, the neces sity to defend b2 (or b7) can create a serious concession from your opponent. The corollary is always to watch out for such queenside at tacks if you're about to move your bishop. 7 i..d3 White plays the move that leads to the widest variety of Exchange Variation lines. For a num ber of reasons White may wish to play 7 �c2 here, but we'll leave that to study and experi ence. 7 ... c6 Black shores up his centre and delays the de velopment of his pieces until he can decide where they want to go.

White exploits Black's omission of ... c6 to get his minority attack rolling early, without having to worry about preparatory moves such as a3 or l:.bl .

queenside pawns from advancing and then im prove the positions of his pieces. If Black doesn't allow White's knight to f4, it may even make the journey tbg l -e2-g3-f5 to Kasparov's favourite square for a knight. The key for White is not to exchange pieces. With the two rooks and two minor pieces each remaining, the op posite-coloured bishops will favour the side with the superior position. Incidentally, there was no profound incon sistency or logical error in Black's strategy of gaining time by omitting ...c6. The specifics of the situation, expressed by the tactic 10 b4!, was an unfortunate accident of the position. In the event, Black had to make an extra queenside pawn move after all ( 1 0. ..a6), and yet another follows:
11 a3 c6 12 �c2 g6
It's important to know that one of Black's standard freeing moves is . . . tbe4, whether White's knight is on f3 or e2. Here the simplest answer to 1 2. .. tbe4 is 1 3 i..f4 !, keeping pieces on the board. This is a move that comes up in similar Queen's Gambit positions and should always be considered.
13 f3 (D)
With White's knight on e2, his plan is usu ally f3 and eventually e4. To counter this, Black normally plays ...c5, as we shall see in the Modem Exchange section. That move ren ders White's d-pawn (and d4-square) vulnera ble should he play e4. Unfortunately, Short doesn't have ...c5 available here, so Kasparov has the best of both worlds: a queenside attack and the potential for a relatively problem-free central expansion. 13 .. •tbe6 14 i..h4 tZ:lhS It's generally a good idea to get rid of White's dark-squared bishop, because the pawn on e3 is weak, and even if he plays the move e4, White will have an interior weakness on that square. Of course, e4 also carries with it the threat to bowl Black over! 15 i..xe7 1 5 i.. f2 is sometimes played to protect e3 and d4 in preparation for e4.

8. ..
tt:Jbd7 (D) In this position, still following the main line of the Exchange Variation, White makes a con sequential decision. Where he puts his king's knight will determine the nature of further play. First, we look at putting it on f3 (the Carlsbad Variation), and then on e2 (the Modem Ex change Variation). Carlsbad Variation 9 ll:Bf3 (D) As explained more than once, the move tZ:lf3 may not actually be a decision now, but one already made at an earlier stage. Because so many players use move-orders with an early tZ:lf3, even 1 d4 d5 2 tZ:lf3, the Carlsbad Varia tion is more important in practice than the Modern Exchange Variation. It is as strategi cally rich as any other QGD variation. By putting his knight on f3, White gives up the plan of f3 and e4 for the time being. But the knight controls e5 and can go there at the right moment, and then there can follow either f3 or the ambitious f4. Apart from that there are an array of other choices including playing e4, by which White takes on an isolated pawn in order to attack (usually after placing rooks on d l and el). The most famous strategy of all is the mi nority attack by b4-b5. When one includes other variations in which it occurs, thousands of games have been played using the minority
54 MASTERING THE CHESS OPENINGS
attack and thousands of pages written about it. As indicated before, the ideas behind the attack are relatively simple and easy to understand. Not surprisingly, actually putting them into practice is an art that depends upon profound understanding of the timing and therefore feasi bility of each plan. The interesting thing about the Carlsbad Vari ation is that White can mix and match these plans, switching from one to another in mid stream! That factor makes it one of the most strategically complicated lines in chess and, I think, a much more difficult variation than the Modem Exchange with i..d3 and tbge2. Black needs to react to all this and can do so by knowing the major themes. As is the situa tion with White's ideas, the relevant manoeuv res have to be timed according to circum stance. Black's most rudimentary freeing plan is ... tbe4, which White avoids in certain lines and allows in others. Another favourite idea is to try to get some sort of kingside attack. This includes the move ... i..d6 in a majority of such cases. For example, White will often play i..xf6 in order to divert Black's bishop to f6 and speed up his minority attack by b4. Then, even at the cost of two tempi, Black will use the time for ...i.. e7-d6. Another standard idea is to chal lenge White on his own turf on the queenside. That can involve an early ...a5, or ...a6 with ...b5 (perhaps with ... tZ:lb6-c4 to follow). 9 . . . l:.e8 This is almost always played. Black takes over the e-file in preparation for an eventual ... tbe4 and clears the way for ... tbf8 in order to protect h7. It's also very useful to play ... tbg6 or ... tbe6 in many variations. 10 o-o tt::i rs (D) At this point White has many reasonable moves. Let's see some games. 11 l:.abl Karpov - Ljubojevic Linares 1989 We'll start with one of the oldest moves, pre paring the direct b4-b5. Karpov plays White, which is interesting because he was the most prominent player to begin using 1 1 h3 (as played in the next few games). After you see this game you'll wonder why he switched!
11. . . tt:Je4 (D)
This is the traditional anti-Carlsbad proce dure. Essentially, Black wants clarification and a strong central presence to counteract White's on the queenside. A good alternative is the queenside restraint plan by 1 1 .. .a5, usually followed up by some sort of kingside attack ( ... tbg6, ...i..d6).

Another example of the pure minority at tack unmixed with central or kingside action. Leaving the pawn on c6 gives Black a weak backward c-pawn after bxc6, but ... cxb5 in stead leaves him with a weak d-pawn. Oddly enough, the first option is usually preferable for Black, following the notion that pawns on the third rank are easier to defend than ones on the fourth rank. In this case the trade-off is the backward pawn on an open file (one on c6) ver sus the isolated pawn on a closed file (one on d5).

After 25 ... tbxc5 26 dxc5 Bartashnikov says that 26 ...g6 27 tbd4 gives a large advantage; that could certainly be argued after 27 ...�a6 with the idea of ... i..e5. Still, the basic idea is right, because 27 �b3 ! is strong. Note that it's Black's lack of a back-rank escape-square that makes things difficult here, in a sequence such as 26 ...�a6 27 �bl ! �c8. And is 26 ...�b4 27 �b3 a5 tenable? For example, 28 g3 i..a7 29 tbd4 i..xc5 30 tbxc6 �xb3 (again, only the lack of an escape-square even makes this nec essary!) 3 1 axb3 i..b4. See also 24 ... �a6 in stead of the unfortunate 24 ...�b5. The point is that Black's sole weakness on c6 probably isn't fatal in this pawn-structure, and that relative piece placement is almost always the deciding factor. 26 a4! This, however, does the trick since Black has to destroy his pawn-structure to avoid loss of material.

Timman - Kasparov London ( USSR-RoW) (2) 1984 11 i..xf6 i..xf6 (D) 12 b4 White exchanges on f6 because he wants to speed up his minority attack. This is a standard idea which has been very popular, in part be cause the ideas are so clear and White has eliminated various moves such as ... tbe4 and ... tbg4. This raises the question of which mi nor pieces are best in the Carlsbad structure; as always, it depends upon time and activity. Black can't wait around for l:.abl and b5, so he has to pick a plan. Since ... tbe4 isn't possible, he can choose to play a restraint game on the queenside or organize an attack on the king. In the event, Kasparov does both, but naturally looks towards the enemy king first. 12• • • i..g4 One of the standard anti-Minority Attack plans was first brought to notice in the game Timman-Spassky, Tilburg 1 979: 12. ..a6 13 a4 g6 14 b5 a5 !

In this position most players pursue some combination of cen tral expansion and queenside minority attack. The many versions of this strategy give us a deeper understanding of what both sides' ideas are and how they should be applied. 9 ... �e8 10 O-O llJf8 (D) White has played various moves at this junc ture. They all share the same goals, but initially go in different directions. In contrast to the Carlsbad Variation, White doesn't have lLie5; furthermore, the move e4 without f3 will lead to an isolated pawn position in which having a knight on f3 would be much better than one on e2.
62 MASTERING THE CHESS OPENINGS
That leaves a series of ways to prepare for e4 by playing f3 and, for example, �adl and/or �fe l . Alternatively, White can play a3 and/or �abl to enforce b4 before turning his attention to the centre. We'll get a feel for the nature of the play by seeing the following games. This time the imbedded notes and games are partic ularly important because they show alternate set-ups for both sides. Avrukh - Lugovoi Beersheba-Peterburg 1999
11 f3 (D)
This has probably been played more than any other move. White makes no bones about playing for e4. But that's not necessarily as committal as it looks because by playing f3 in stead of moving a rook or knight, White doesn't reveal which piece distribution Black will have to face. ll ... g6 l 1 . ..lLig6 is seen in the next game. With 1 1 . ..g6 Black prepares ... lLie6, which if played at once loses a pawn to �xf6 and �xh7+. The alternative 1 1 .. .�e6 was seen in Van Wely-Piket, Antwerp 1 996, a well-played game that includes several themes that recur in this line: 1 2 �h4!? �c8 (in almost every line with f3, ...c5 is Black's way to try to equalize or take the initiative; however, if White is careful, he can either prevent the advance of the c-pawn or render it harmless) 1 3 �adl (a move with a double purpose: to prepare e4, and to discour age ...c5, which would expose Black's d-pawn after dxc5) 1 3. ..a6 1 4 @h l lLig6 1 5 �f2 (D). We can see this characteristic manoeuvre throughout the Modem Exchange Variation. It turns out that 1 2 �h4 is multifaceted. One mo tivation is escape: with the bishop on g5, the moves ... lLig6 and h6 might force its exchange. The other idea is to protect the two central pawns. The game continued 1 5. ..c5 1 6 dxc5 !? �xc5 l 7 lLid4 (White grabs the outpost, and his knight is so influential that Black trades it off, and then exchanges White's bishop on d3 as well; the only problem is that it's harder for Black to attack the resulting pawn-structure) l 7 ... �xd4 1 8 exd4 lLif4! 1 9 �fel lLixd3 20 'tfVxd3 'tfVb6 2 1 �d2 'tfVc6 22 �de2 (taking stock, we see that White's bishop has more prospects than Black's, for example along the h2-b8 diag onal, and his rooks are more active; therefore Piket launches a queenside attack) 22 ... b5 23 a3 h6 24 g4!

From this point White managed to generate a little pressure because of his active bishop, but the game was eventually drawn. 12 �adl This is a very common move: White wants to play e4 and therefore gives the pawn on d4 more support so that it will be less vulnerable when that advance is played.

Then 5 .i.f4 is outside the realm of a true Exchange Variation and anyway, Black can equalize easily by 5 ... .i.d6, or go for more by 5 ... .i.f5. Notice that this differs from the important Alatortsev Variation, which goes 1 d4 d5 2 c4 e6 3 lLic3 .i.e7 (which has its own section above). In that case, after 4 cxd5 exd5 5 .i.f4, Black would have to use up an extra tempo to play 5 ... .i.d6, and the move 5 ... .i.f5? is simply bad after 6 'tfVb3. Conclusion: even though the Alatortsev order doesn't permit White to play an Exchange Variation, there is no automatic equalizer for Black after the moves 4 cxd5 exd5 5 .i.f4.
QUEEN'S GAMBIT DECLINED 6 7
The remaining natural move after 3 cxd5 exd5 4 lLic3 c6 is 5 lLif3. After this Black can still avoid the Exchange Variation by 5 ... �f5, which is incidentally considered a good move that equalizes. Then it's important to see that 6 'iVb3 can be safely answered by 6 ... 'iVb6 or 6 ... °i!Vc8. The position after 3 lLif3 (D) is critical. It can arise from other move-orders, so sometimes White may be stuck with it. For example, one way in which this can happen us via l lLif3; e.g., I . ..d5 2 c4 e6 3 d4. Another route is 1 d4 d5 2 lLif3 e6 3 c4.

At this point there are quite a few issues: a) I'm not too concerned here about trans positions to completely different openings, but here 3 ...c6 will usually transpose to a Semi Slav; e.g., if White plays 4 lLic3 or 4 e3. b) Black also has 3 ... c5 4 cxd5 exd5, when 5 -t::'i c3 is the Tarrasch Defence to the Queen's Gambit. In this exact position, White can devi ate from the 'pure' Tarrasch Variation by skip ping lLic3 for the moment and playing 5 i..g5 ! ?, which gives him some extra opportunities. That may be confusing if you're just starting out with this opening, but if you're curious you can find details in the books. c) Usually Black will play 3 ... lLif6 here. Let me repeat what I said in the text and expand upon why this is an important position. The most common way to get to it is not by 1 d4 d5 2 c4 e6 3 Cllf3 lll f6. It comes up more often via the move-order 1 d4 lLif6 2 c4 e6 (D). In this position a lot of players would like to avoid the Nimzo-Indian Defence (3 tll c3 .i.b4), so they play 3 Cllf3 instead of 3 lll c3. Then if Black plays 3 ...d5, we're back to the basic posi tion. But Black doesn't have to play a Queen's Gambit. He can choose to play the Queen's In dian Defence by 3 ...b6, or the Modem Benoni by 3 ...c5 4 d5 exd5 5 cxd5 d6 6 lll c3 g6, intend- ing ... �g7. There's more to be said about the Modem Benoni. Its standard order is 1 d4 lllf6
2 c4 c5 3 d5 e6 4 lll
c3 exd5 5 cxd5 d6 and in most cases 6 e4 g6. However, by having in cluded the move tll f3, White has forfeited the chance to play popular Benoni variations such as 7 f4 �g7 8 .i.b5+. Thus lll f3 limits White's options. Now we return to 1 d4 d5 2 c4 e6 3 lllf3 lll f6
(D):
There are probably more serious negatives than positives for White with lLif3 already hav ing been played, but let's look at a few bene fits for him first. Please remember that this is the complex and confusing version of the move-order presentation in the beginning of the
68 MASTERING THE CHESS OPENINGS
chapter - I'm trying to fit in as much informa tion as I can ! Those who are experienced in the Queen's Gambit (or who have read this chapter) will see that this move-order avoids the main-line posi tions in which Black delays ... ctJf6 in favour of 3 ... .i.. e7, that is, 1 d4 d5 2 c4 e6 3 tLlc3 (instead of 3 ctJf3) 3 ... j,e7, the Alatortsev Variation mentioned above. Notice also that if 1 d4 ctJf6 2 c4 e6 is Black's move-order, then 3 ctJf3 j,e7?! is no longer logical as a substitute for 3 ...d5; apart from the answer 4 ctJc3, White could play
4 d5 !?.
If White gets to this basic position ( 1 d4 d5 2 c4 e6 3 ctJf3 ctJf6), he has the choice of playing 4 g3, which is called the 'Catalan Opening'. It is absolutely sound, although rarely used on the lower and average levels of play. The Catalan is not optimally entered by 3 ctJc3 ctJf6 4 g3, be cause 4 ...dxc4 (or 4 ... .i..b4 followed by ... dxc4) makes it awkward for White to recover his pawn. White will usually answer 3 ... ctJf6 with 4 ctJc3 (D). Now consider this further move-order infor mation: 1) White has yet another benefit from hav ing included ctJf3. If Black now plays 4 ...ctJbd7, then 5 j,g5 c6 6 e3 'tfVa5 ! ? is the Cambridge Springs Defence, which is considered quite playable. This can be forced by Black if White plays the main line 3 ctJc3 ctJf6 4 j,g5 ctJbd7 5 e3 c6 6 ctJf3, and now 6 ... 'tfVa5 is the Cambridge Springs. However, if White has played 4 ctJf3 (instead of 4 j,g5), then after 4 ... ctJbd7, 5 cxd5 exd5 6 .i..f4 is a promising order (this is analysed at the beginning of the Orthodox/Capablanca sec tion). So having ctJf3 in discourages the Cam bridge Springs ! 2) What about the negative effects for White of 4 ctJf3 instead of 4 .i..g5? A couple of them are particularly significant: 2a) Black can choose to play 4 ... dxc4. Then what is considered the most challenging line goes 5 e4 j,b4 6 .i..g5 c5 (6 ...h6 is also played). This introduces the Vienna Variation, which in contemporary chess will often lead to 7 j,xc4 cxd4 8 ctJxd4 j,xc3+ 9 bxc3 'tfVa5 10 j,b5+ (or 10 j,xf6 �xc3+ 1 1 @fl gxf6) 10 ...ctJbd7 (or
10. ..j,d7) 1 1 j,xf6 'tfVxc3+ 12 @fl gxf6 (D)
with a real mess that is still unresolved in the ory and practice. It's all about specifics at that point so I'll leave it to the reader to look up the theory. How ever, both players should know about the Vi enna Variation. For Black, it's an opportunity to play something different, and for White, it's a potential problem to deal with. You can see that the Vienna Variation isn't an issue if White plays 3 ctJc3 and 4 j,g5 . 2b) After 4 ctJf3, Black can also continue 4 ... j,b4, leading to other complex variations such as 5 j,g5 ctJbd7 6 cxd5 exd5 7 e3 c5 8 .i..d3 �a5 and 5 �a4+ ctJc6 6 a3 .i..xc3+ 7 bxc3 tLle4 8 �c2. Again, it's the sort of thing that Black might consider playing (perhaps for sur prise value) and that White should be prepared for. 2c) As explained in the beginning of the chapter, 4 ... j,e7 5 cxd5 exd5 6 j,g5 O-O 7 e3 c6 gives us an Exchange Variation, but with
QUEEN'S GAMBIT DECLINED 69
White's knight committed to f3. This is the Carlsbad Variation, given its own section. The only problem for White is that he' s lost the op tion of placing the king' s knight on e2, which is the favourite development for a majority of players. 2d) Black can still try to avoid the Carlsbad Exchange variation altogether by means of 4 lZJf3 j,e7, and if 5 cxd5 cxd5 6 j,g5, then 6 ... c6
(DJ.
This has the idea 7 e3 j,f5 with the easy play that usually comes from ... .i.f5. To avoid this White can play 7 �c2 (to prevent ... j,f5) 7 ...g6 !? (to enforce it, but creating a weakness) 8 e3 .i.f5 9 j,d3 j,xd3 10 �xd3 O-O (10. ..lZJbd7 is a good alternative) 1 1 j,xf6 .i.xf6 12 b4 'tfVd6 13 �bl lZJd7 14 O-O l::L fd8, Andersson-Kasparov, Belgrade 1 988, and now 15 a4 seems like a good idea, countering ... b5 and considering a5 and lZJa4 at the right moment. Nevertheless, Black should know about these details because he can gain equality or very close to equality in these positions, and they provide a way to avoid the Exchange Variation. 2e) For the sake of completeness, I should add that White can also skip 5 cxd5 and go back to a trad!tional line by 5 .i.g5 O-O and now play 6 e3, or he can try to get into another version of the Exchange Variation by 6 cxd5 exd5, but even then it's not easy because the books say that 6 ... lZJxd5 is satisfactory. 2f) Finally, after 4 lZJf3, 4 ... j,e7 can be an swered by the independent move 5 .i.f4 (DJ. This important option has a long history, but I've had to forego an examination of it. One in teresting aspect of 5 j,f4 is that in the main lines Black will soon play ... c5, following the notion that an early move by the bishop on c 1 will be met by queenside action. For example, 5 ... O-O 6 e3 c5 7 dxc5 .i.xc5 8 a3 lZJc6 9 'tfVc2 (or the popular 9 cxd5 lZJxd5 10 lZJxd5 exd5 1 1 j,d3 j,b6 12 O-O d4 13 e4, with a standard kingside majority structure that we see elsewhere in this book) 9 ... 'tfVa5 10 lZJd2 or 10 O-O-O. It goes on and on. All this makes quite a case for 3 lZJc3 and its predictability. Such a barrage of move-order details can be disheartening, but they are important if you really want to master the Queen's Gambit and not merely play around with it. There are three redeeming features in this situation. First, you don't have to learn these details all at once. By playing the Queen's Gambit, you'll soon real ize the importance of move-order subtleties, and either hearken back to this book or learn more by other means. The second piece of good news is that you can pick and choose what you want to do and avoid having to deal with most of these issues. That is especially true if you're Black. Finally, there is every chance that your opponent will know less about move-order is sues than you do!
3 Slav and Semi-Slav
1 d4 d5 2 c4 c6 (
D)
In this chapter we'll be investigating the Slav complex, embracing all variations of the Queen's Gambit that begin with 1 d4 d5 2 c4 c6. The Slav Defence is long-established as one of Black's most solid and effective answers to 1 d4. Max Euwe famously used the opening in his world championship matches versus Ale khine in the 1930s, and in the last two decades various forms of it (including the Semi-Slav, discussed in this chapter) have grown tremen dously in popularity. Chess professionals in particular have found that the Slav's solidity is complemented by the dynamic counterattacks which can arise if White plays aggressively for an advantage The Slav move 2 ...c6 reinforces Black's d5- pawn and it therefore begs comparison with the Queen's Gambit Declined (a.k.a. 'QGD': 1 d4 d5 2 c4 e6). In the QGD, Black's second move 2 ...e6 blocks off his own bishop on c8, making development of that piece difficult. That is not true of the Slav Defence, although 2 ...c6 uses up the c6-square, which in most openings is the best square for Black's queen's knight. This elimination of a possible ... lLic6, Black's 'ideal' development, is considered to be a prime draw back of 2 ...c6. A comparison of these two open ings' respective disadvantages, however, would seem to favour the Slav over the Queen's Gam bit Declined, since after 1 d4 d5 the move ...lLic6 tends to be fairly ineffective anyway. A much more important consideration is that in the Slav, Black has wasted a tempo if he wants to play the important move ...c5, so often a key move (or positional threat) in the QGD. It's also revealing to compare the respective Exchange Variations of these two openings. In the Queen's Gambit Declined, I d4 d5 2 c4 e6 3 lLic3 lLif6 4 cxd5 exd5 gives White a 2- 1 central pawn-majority (a desirable feature for him); whereas in the Slav, I d4 d5 2 c4 c6 3 cxd5 cxd5 leaves the central pawn count the same. Super ficially that would seem to favour the Slav ver sion over the QGD. Again, things are not so easy. First, there are many players who prefer such imbalanced structures, and in the QGD Exchange, some would argue that Black's open e-file is more useful than White's open c-file. In addition, the QGD move 2 ...e6 affords Black the opportunity to develop his king's bishop quickly and thus enables the desirable move ...O-O in short order. In the Slav Defence, by con trast, Black will take some time to play ...
O-O
because he has to find a place for the f8-bishop, and trying to do so by a speedy ...e6 would seem to contradict the main advantage of 2 ...c6, i.e., to be able to develop the c8-bishop quickly. I shall use the name 'Slav' for lines in which Black doesn 't play ...e6 before bringing his queen's bishop out, or at least doesn't eliminate that option within the first few moves. By con trast, 'Semi-Slav' denotes a variation that be gins with both ...e6 and ...c6 on the first few moves; for example, I d4 d5 2 c4 c6 3 lLic3 e6, or here 3 ...lLif6 4 lLif3 e6, or 1 d4 d5 2 c4 e6 3 lLic3 c6, etc. This will include the Meran Varia tion, described in its own section. Although the most common lines in the Slav and Semi-Slav include ...dxc4, Black can also play moves such as ...a6 and ...g6. The latter moves hold the d5 point and emphasize the fundamental solidity of this defence.
SLAV AND SEMI-SLAV 71
Solidity tends to indicate lack of ambition, but that's not necessarily so in the Slav, since most of the main lines are unbalanced. It is true, however, that Black will seldom be playing for an early initiative or tactical chances unless White provokes him. A reason for this can be seen by the picture after the second move. Black is certainly not ready to waste a move on the pawn-break ...c5, but the only other way to challenge the centre would involve ...e5, a move unlikely to happen soon in view of the fact that White will almost always play lllf3 on this or the next couple of moves. Nevertheless, Black's second move has a po tential dynamism that will express itself in spe cific situations. For example, in most variations of both the Slav and Semi-Slav, Black will play ... dxc4 at a fairly early stage. Then, although it may seem trivial, White needs to pay serious at tention to recovering his pawn, because Black may play simply . . .b5 and hang on to it (com pare the Queen's Gambit Declined or Accepted, where this is a rare occurrence). Should this possibility require the move a4 on White's part, he has used up a tempo and weakened his b4- square. Already on his third move, then, White has a limited choice of continuations that avoid the forced loss of a pawn and yet still contain some punch. His candidates for the job are 3 cxd5 (the Exchange Variation), 3 lllc3, and the main move 3 lllf3. In the right situation White might prefer to gambit his c-pawn for compen sation elsewhere, leading of course to unbal anced play. You have seen or will see that all major openings have move-order issues. The Slav is no different but the majority of important deci sions come on very early moves and mostly comprise independent set-ups rather than trans positions. The description that follows is a re source to which you can return after you gain some experience. 3 t2Jf3 Although 3 t2:lf3 is the main move, White sometimes uses 3 lll c3 ( D) in order either to by pass certain lines or to play independently. Two of the most frequent continuations are 3 ... lllf6 4 cxd5 cxd5 5 .1i.f4, which is considered in the Exchange Variation section, and 3 ...e6 4 e4, the Marshall Gambit, discussed in the Semi Slav section. A couple of unique move-orders to watch out for as White, or to use as Black, are: a) 3 ... dxc4, which is quite complex after 4 e3 b5 5 a4 b4 6 lllbl (6 llla2 e6 protects the pawn on b4; there usually follows 7 .1i.xc4 lll f6 8 lll f3, again considered equal) 6 ... .1i.a6 7 'iVc2 t2:lf6 8 .1i.xc4 .1i.xc4 9 'iVxc4 'iVd5. All this is the ory that I won't pursue; it's simply good to know it exists. Or White can play 4 e4 (D). This is somewhat more ambitious: 4 ...b5 (or 4 ...e5 5 lllf3 exd4 6 'iVxd4 'iVxd4 7 lllxd4 with prospects of a small edge for White) 5 a4 b4 6 t2:la2 (6 lll ce2!?) 6 ... lllf6 7 e5 llld5 8 .1i.xc4, af ter which Black has various set-ups involving ... .1i.f5, ... .1i.a6, or simply ...e6. White would like to get in the moves .1i.d2, lll c l -b3 and l::t c l . b) 3 ...e5 !? is the Winawer Counter-Gambit, about which a lot has been written. Obviously if Black can get away with this move unpunished he will have freed his game entirely. I'll just give a skeletal structure of the main lines and refer you to theory to get the details: 4 cxd5 (4
72 MASTERING THE CHESS OPENINGS
dxe5 d4 5 llle4 'iVa5+ 6 �d2 'iVxe5 7 lll g3; 4 e3 e4 !? or 4 ... exd4) 4 ... cxd5 5 dxe5 (5 lllf3 e4 6 llle5) 5 ...d4 6 lll e4 'iVa5+ and now 7 �d2 'iVxe5 or 7 llld2 lll d7 !? or 7 ... lll h6!?. c) After 3 ... lll f6, White can play 4 e3, often his main reason for using the 3 lll c3 move-order. That's because 4 ...�f5?! is now a mistake due to 5 cxd5 cxd5?! (5 ... lllxd5 6 'iVb3) 6 'iVb3 with the idea 6 ... 'iVb6 7 lll xd5. Compare this with 3 lll f3 lll f6 4 e3 below, when 4 ...�f5 is perfectly playable. After 3 lll c3 lll f6 4 e3, Black can in stead play 4 ...g6, 4 ...a6 or 4 ... �g4!?, the latter of particular interest to players who want to keep the game dynamic in character. Chess is as flexible as you want it to be, al though main lines usually give White the best chance to gain a lasting advantage. 3 •.• lll f6 4 lll c3 Conceding that the more aggressive varia tions involving �g5 against the Semi-Slav aren't to their taste, players are turning rela tively often to the modest 4 e3 ( D ).
B
If White plays lllc3 next he is likely to achieve a standard formation, but 4 e3 opens up some other possibilities for both sides. Without going into detail here, this move-order com pares to 4 lll c3 e6 5 e3 in the following ways: 1) It sidesteps 4 lllc3 dxc4 5 a4 �f5 (the main line of the Slav proper), because 4 e3 dxc4 5 �xc4 is as favourable a development as White could wish for. 2) It gives White more leeway in replying to the Semi-Slav. That is, after 4 ...e6, White can revert to the main line by 5 lllc3 (see the Semi Slav section of this chapter), but he can also use some combination of the moves lll bd2, �d3, O-O and b3. Those last formations are not pur sued in this book but can hopefully be under stood on general grounds, i.e. by omitting lllc3, White avoids having to suffer the tempo gaining moves ...dxc4 and ...b5-b4. This last se quence occurs in the Meran Variation of the Semi-Slav, and will be seen in that section. 3) After 4 e3, Black may decide not to coop erate in returning to Semi-Slav territory. He can instead play 4 ...�f5 or 4 ...�g4, placing his 'bad' bishop outside the pawn-chain and leav ing White's bishop on c l looking rather sad. In that case we return to the point made often in this book: in d-pawn openings, White should remember to look at 'iVb3 or 'iVa4, when re sponding to the early development of the c8- bishop. It's unlikely that any other course will yield an advantage versus Black's natural de velopment. To demonstrate that trade-off, Jet's take a look at the common Black deviations after 4 e3: a) 4 ... �g4 5 'iVb3 hits b7 and prepares lll e5. Then 5 ... 'iVb6 (D) is a good way to continue. The game Korchnoi-Acs, Budapest 2003 saw 6 llle5 �f5 (Black wants to play ...e6 and ... lllbd7 with the freer development) 7 cxd5 'iVxb3 8 axb3 lllxd5, when White's weak b4- square is a bother that at least compensates Black for his opponent's central majority: 9 llla3 (9 llld2?! lll b4 is awkward; e.g., 10 l::t a4 e6 1 1 e4 �g6 12 'litdl { 1 2 f3? b5 } 12 ... llld7, etc.) 9 ...f6 10 llld3 llla6 1 1 �d2 e6 12 f3 �g6 13 lll c2 �xd3 14 �xd3 lllab4 1 5 'lite2 lll xd3 16 'litxd3 �d6, and if anything Black has an edge. Why can't White play the same game and get the advantage by 6 'iVxb6 axb6? Because he
SLA V AND SEMI-SLAV 73
can't exploit the b5 outpost; for instance, 7 lllc3 (7 cxd5 lllxd5 and White still needs to take no tice of ... lll b4; e.g., 8 lll e5? lll b4! ; also ineffec tive is 7 lll e5 .. !i.f5 8 lllc3 e6 with equality) 7 ...e6 8 cxd5 exd5 9 .1i.e2 .1i.d6 10 O-O b5 ! ; note that White' s bishop on c l is bad in these lines. b) 4 ... .1i.f5 and now: b l ) After 5 lllc3 e6 6 lllh4, both 6 ... .1i.g6 7 lll xg6 hxg6 and 6 ... ..te4 ! 7 f3 .1i.g6 8 lllxg6 hxg6 have been tested in high-level grandmas ter play, with and without the insertion of °it'b3 and ... li'h6. This has generally resulted in bal anced play, especially after 6 ... .1i.e4. White has two bishops, but neither one is as good Black's bishop, and Black's open h-file can come in handy, often in conjunction with ... .1i.d6 and the aggressive move ... g5 to disturb things early on and force a change of structure that accommo dates the knights. b2) 5 cxd5 cxd5 6 °it'b3 (D).
B
In this position Black must choose how he wants to defend the b-pawn. 6 ... °it'b6 is possible but the more ambitious set-up is 6 ... 'fic7, in tending 7 .1i.d2 lllc6 8 .1i.b5 e6. White's plan is to weaken Black's pawn-structure by .1i.xc6 (when ...bxc6 is normally best), trade dark squared bishops by .1i.b4, and then mount pres sure down the c-file. He might, for example, play a rook to c 1 and occupy c5 with a knight after the preliminary llla4. From Black's per spective (after .1i.xc6 and ...bxc6), he will have two bishops and pressure down an open b-file, with prospects of ...c5 after, say, the moves ... 'i'Bb6 and . . . llld7. At the moment White seems to be getting very slight advantages in this type of position, but even those may well prove to be illusory. The whole line is quite playable for Black in any case. c) 4 ...g6 5 lll c3 .1i.g7 is a hybrid Grtinfeld/Slav variation that is known as the Schlechter Slav. This position can also arise via 1 d4 lllf6 2 c4 g6 3 lllc3 d5 4 lllf3 .i.g7 5 e3 c6. After, for ex ample, 6 .1i.d3 O-O 7 O-O ..llg4 8 h3 .1i.xf3 9 'i'Bxf3 e6 10 l::t d l lll bd7 (D) White wants to use his two bishops and space advantage and slowly make progress on the queenside, whereas Black is happy that White's dark-squared bishop is re stricted and will strive for . . .e5. An ultra-solid position has arisen. Some times Black can consider ... dxc4 followed by ...e5 but that brings White's light-squared bishop to an aggressive diagonal. At the moment the desirable move ...e5 is difficult to implement because Black's d-pawn requires defence. As a general rule, the player with two bishops will have some advantage unless the opponent's knights already have an available outpost or he can create one by means of a forcing attack. Here, since Black cannot do so, White probably retains a small edge. Still, these positions are very resilient and one could also argue Black's bishop on g7 is so much superior to White's on c 1 that he can claim full equality. Note that it doesn't help White to open the game immedi ately because that would activate his opponent's knights: 1 1 e4! ? e5 ! 12 dxe5 ( 12 exd5 exd4 1 3 dxc6 llle5 14 °it'e2 lllxd3 15 l:!.xd3 bxc6 with an equal position; 12 .1i.e3 dxe4 13 lllxe4 lll xe4 14 .1i.xe4 'fih4 15 d5 f5 16 dxc6? fxe4 17 'fig4 "it'xg4 1 8 hxg4 lll f6 and Black has the advan tage) 12 ... lll xe5 13 'i'Be2 lllxd3 14 l::t xd3 l::t e8 with dynamic play that appears evenly balanced.
74 MASTERING THE CHESS OPENINGS
Slav Main Line Now we move into the realm of the Slav proper, leaving the Semi-Slav (4 ...e6) for later. Black begins with:
4. ..
dxc4 This is a rather strange-looking move, at least to the inexperienced player. With his first three moves, Black has carefully maintained his pawn on d5 and prevented e4. Now he sur renders his control of that square and grants White a central majority to boot! Perhaps that might make sense if 4 ... dxc4 won a pawn, but White can regain the pawn on c4 fairly easily. As is often the case, Black's motivation fol lows from a combination of the goals and the specifics of the position. He would like to de velop his pieces, and since 4 ... e6 cuts off the queen's bishop, it would be nice to place that piece on f5 to be followed by ... e6 and kingside development. However, the immediate 4 ... i.f5?! is one of those cases in which the bishop comes out a bit too early, because White has played tbc3 instead of e3 (that is, as opposed to 3 t2:lf3 t2:lf6 4 e3 .1i.f5 above). Play can continue 5 cxd5 ! and now: a) 5 ...cxd5?! 6 'i'Bb3 ! ( D). 6 ... 'i'Bb6!? (6. .. .1i.c8 is an admission of failure but perhaps best; 6 ... b6 is always weakening in such positions - White can take advantage of Black's vulnerable light squares by 7 i.f4 tbc6
8 e4 ! dxe4 9 .1i.b5 i.d7 10 t2:le5 t2:lxe5 1 1 dxe5
with the idea l::t d l ) 7 'i'Bxb6!? (White can also grab a pawn by 7 t2:lxd5 t2:lxd5 8 'i'Bxd5 e6, and return it advantageously by 9 'i'Bb3 'i'Bxb3 10 axb3 i.c2 1 1 .1i.d2 t2:lc6 12 l::t c l .1i.xb3 13 e4)
B

... .1i.g4 involves the move 'ii' b3, attacking the b-pawn. But after 4 ... a6, Black can play ... .1i.g4 or . . . i.f5 and answer White' s 'ii' b3 by either ... b5, which forces a resolution of the centre, or the remarkable ... l:!.a7! ?. One point of the latter move is that Black needn't devote his queen to defence of b7 and thus it is less exposed to at tack. To clarify that a bit you might want to compare the lines after 4 t2:lc3 .1i.f5?! 5 'ii' b3 °'J/i/c7 or 5 ... °'J/i/c8, which expose Black' s queen to potential attack down the c-file. It's also worth noting that the move 4 ...a6 is a very useful one in the Exchange Variation after 5 cxd5 cxd5, since it prevents t2:lb5 as well as White' s stan dard move .1i.b5. In fact, we shall look at a line that comes from 4 ...a6 in the Exchange Varia tion section below. 5 a4 The Geller Gambit 5 e4 b5 6 e5 attempts to use White's broad centre for attacking purposes and mix in some tactical opportunism. In the process there arise positional features involving the struggle for light and dark squares by both players. To give a taste of this complex gambit, let's take a brieflook at the old main line, which goes 6 .. . t2:ld5 7 a4 (D). 7 ... e6! (securing d5; other moves are risky for instance, 7 . . . .1i.b7 8 e6 ! shatters Black's pawn-structure) 8 axb5 t2:lxc3 9 bxc3 cxb5 10 tl:Jg5 (threatening both 1 1 °'J/i/f3 and 1 1 t2:lxf7)

Needless to say, there is more theory on this complex line, but the con clusion is that Black stands well, in large part because White' s attack has to depend upon pieces alone, and he can't wait around too long while Black prepares . . . a5 and ...b4. 5 ... .1i.f5 Just in time, Black gets his bishop out and stops White from forming an ideal centre with e4. This is the choice of most players. There are a number of valid alternatives, including 5 ...c5 and 5 . . . i.g4. Having to choose one, I'll look briefly at a third, highly interesting, alternative: 5 ... t2:la6 (D). What on earth is Black doing, after first giv ing up the centre, by wasting time and putting his knight on the edge of the board? As Graham Burgess points out, this is to some degree a waiting move. Black wants White to move his e-pawn so that he can play . . . .1i.g4. But if you think about it there are few if any other useful moves by which Black can temporize! Although 5 . . . t2:la6 doesn't exactly set the house on fire, it is a developing move, and sometimes the knight can occupy the b4 outpost. Otherwise it might recentralize by ... t2:lc7 or even give support to a ...c5 counterthrust. White's most natural move is 6 e3, which can be met by 6 ... .1i.g4! (a trick is 6 ... i.f5 7 .1i.xc4 t2:lb4 8 O-O tbc2?? 9 e4 tbxal 1 0 exf5, etc.) 7 .1i.xc4 e6 (7 ... t2:lb4? 8 tll e5!) 8 h3 .1i.h5 9 g4 (9 O-O t2:lb4 1 0 °'J/i/e2 .1i.e7 I I l:tdl O-O 12 g4!? i.g6 13 e4 is the kind of restraint centre ex plored in the chapter on structures in Volume 1 ;

here Black's bishop is outside the pawn-chain, but in real danger of being cut off, whereas Black's knight on b4 is a definite plus) 9 ... .1i.g6. At this point let's break off in order to explore an idea that many of you must have been won dering about: 10 .1i.xa6 ! ? bxa6 (D ). White captures the knight on a6 to double and isolate Black's pawns on a7, a6 and c6 (the latter on an open file). He also has two central pawns and a nice support point on e5 for his knight, so that moves like lll e5 and °iVf3, per haps followed by h4-h5, are potential threats. What are the downsides? First, he has given his opponent the two bishops, which happen to have attractive open lines available. Second, he has weakened his light squares, a serious issue with this particular pawn-structure. Black has also gained the b-file along which his rook can attack the backward pawn on b2. Finally, White has lost a move capturing the knight and will have a difficult time organizing an attack down the c-file before Black plays ...c5 and puts pres sure on White's centre. Thus we have a typical trade-off between static and dynamic factors. White needs to respond firmly; for example, 1 1 llle5 .1i.d6 ( l l ...c5 !? 1 2 a5 ! .1i.d6?! 1 3 'it'a4+ @f8 14 'it'c6!) 12 lll xg6 (12 'i'Bf3 l:tc8 ! 13 e4 .1i.b4! 14 lllxg6 hxg6 15 .1i.e3 c5 16 l:tdl 'i'Ba5 and the dynamic side is getting the better of it) 12 ...hxg6 13 g5 with some kind of dynamic equilibrium after 13 ... lllh5 14 lll e4 or 13. .. llld5
14 e4 lllxc3 1 5 bxc3 c5 16 dxc5 i.xc5 17
'it'xd8+ l:txd8. In fact, this trade of bishop for doubled a pawns arises repeatedly in chess openings. For example, there are several variations of the King's Indian Defence in which Black plays ... llla6 and White bites with .1i.xa6. One such is
1 d4 lllf6 2 c4 g6 3 lllc3 .1i.g7 4 e4 d6 5 .1i.e2 O-O

1 e4 d6 2 d4 lllf6 3 lllc3 g6 4 f4 .1i.g7 5 lllf3 O-O
6 .1i.d3 llla6, inviting .1i.xa6.

Of course White can also offer the trade-off. For example, a variation of the Reti Opening goes 1 lllf3 d5 2 c4 e6 3 g3 lll f6 4 .1i.g2 c6 (or 4 ... dxc4 5 llla3 i.xa3 6 bxa3 ! ?) 5 O-O dxc4 6 llla3 .1i.xa3 7 bxa3 with the bishop-pair, dark squares, and b-file for the pawn. And so forth. You will find other examples as you move through the chess world. This is an example of cross-pollination: the point is that when you have a position in which your knight is about to be captured on a6 or a3, you will come to rec ognize the pros and cons of allowing that cap ture. Returning to the main move 5 ... .1i.f5, we have a major split between 6 e3 and 6 llle5, with each now getting its own section. Dutch Variation: 6 e3

f3 lll f6 4 lllc3 dxc4 5 a4 i.fS 6 e3 e6 7 .1i.xc4 The lines are drawn. Both sides are reason ably well developed and White has the central majority. Black's task, then, is to make sure that it can't advance (i.e., e4 cannot be played) until he is ready to snipe at the centre and force White into some undesired change of struc ture. From White's point of view, Black's pawn-structure is super-solid and will only be completely broken down by e4 and d5 . Alter natively, White has the option of e4-e5, seek ing attacking chances. 7 •• . .1i.b4
SLA V AND SEMI-SLAV 77
Black indirectly increases his control over e4.
8 O-O (D)
A basic position. We can see some general features of the game developing. White has a central majority (2: 1 ), and Black has a restraint formation with the light-squared bishop in front of the pawn-chain (see Chapter 3 in Volume 1 on pawn-structures for an explanation of the various types of restraint centres). In the situa tion before us, Black is not waiting for e4 but preventing the advance of the e-pawn by piece play. He has two pieces attacking e4 and a third ready to exchange off a piece defending that square. Whether or not that situation persists, he will try to gain time for the characteristic pawn-breaks ...c5 and ...e5. Note that Black's bishop is on an outpost on b4 and cannot be expelled by pawns; therefore White may need to retreat his knight or divert resources to drive the bishop away. As a first plan, White would like to play f3 in order to get e4 in, but that would require either a knight re treat or advance to e5, and both moves will al low an early ...c5 . This leaves White with two basic approaches: a) He can support a central advance with his pieces, the classical approach. In that case, White wants to pose Black the challenge of confronting an ideal centre; b) He can chase down Black's bishop on f5 by a variety of methods, including the direct 6 tt:lh4. In that case, should White decide to cap ture the bishop on f5 he will have to forego e4 for some time, but that may not be a bad trade off. These goals can operate in tandem. The more specific decision about whether and when to try to expel Black's bishop on b4 will vary according to circumstance. The 6 e3 variation is probably the most in structive one in traditional Slav practice. It produces games permeated by strategic and positional themes that will be usable in many contexts. 8 ... lllbd7 Black will normally choose between this move and 8 ... O-O. The decision comes down to one's goals and some tactical assessments. Depending upon your goals and who you're playing, a practical drawback of 8 ... lllbd7 is that it opens up some possibilities for an imme diate draw. White can play 9 'it'b3, when Black has to choose between the following: a) 9 ...a5, allowing a draw by 10 llla2 (D). 10 ....1i.e7 (10. ..'iVe7? 1 1 lllxb4 'iVxb4 1 2 'iVxb4 axb4 13 .1i.d2 really isn't acceptable for Black) 1 1 'it'xb7 l:tb8 12 'iVa6 l:ta8 13 'iVxc6 l:tc8 with a draw by perpetual attack. After 9 ... a5, Black can't really avoid this draw, but White can, and often does, playing either 10 llla2 .1i.e7 1 1 lllh4 or 10 lllh4. The last move can lead to, for example, 10 ... .1i.g6 (10. .. .1i.g4 1 1 f3 i.h5 is a good alternative) 1 1 g3 ! ?, not just protecting the knight but also in tending the exotic idea lllxg6, l:tdl and .1i.fl g2. b) 9 ... 'it'b6 is an extremely risky variation that most players would like to avoid even though it may be survivable for Black: 10 e4 (10 lllh4 is still possible) 10 ... .1i.g6 1 1 .1i.xe6!? fxe6 1 2 a5 ! .1i.xa5 13 'iVxe6+ @d8 14 e5 and as I

A: 9 ...

B: 9 ...O-O.
A)
9 ... i.g4 Black has a simple idea: to eliminate White's f3-knight and then temporarily restrain White's pawns with his own on c6 and e6. I talked about this structure in Chapter 3 of Volume 1 . As usual, ...c5 and/or ...e5 are Black's long-term goals. Lugovoi - Kovalevskaya St Petersburg 2000 10 l:tdl 'iYaS Black wants to gain a tempo to implement his plans. Sensing no immediate attack, he doesn't feel that ...O-O is necessary for the mo ment, and may even play ... O-O-O later. 1 1 e4 'iYhS (D) You will see this idea in several lines: Black wishes to cripple White's kingside pawns. But in doing so he gives White the bishop-pair and an even stronger centre. Instead 1 1 ...O-O trans poses to a normal position, and l l .. . .1i.xc3 ! ? 12 bxc3 'i¥xc3 13 l:ta3 ! ? or here 13 .1i.b2 i.xf3 14 gxf3 'i¥a5 1 5 d5 ! ? gives White a lot of compen sation for a pawn. Regardless of the exact as sessment, taking on that kind of position seems impractical for Black. 12 l:td3!? This interesting move avoids having doubled pawns on f3. One alternative is to force Black to carry out his plan by 12 h3 ! ? .1i.xf3 13 'i¥xf3 'i¥xf3 14 gxf3; e.g., 14 ... O-O 1 5 a5 (gaining space) 15 ...a6 16 i.e2 (16 .1i.f4!?) 16 ... l:tfd8 17 l:ta4 .1i.e7 (the position should be equal; White's structural immobility detracts from his two bishop advantage) 1 8 f4 t2:le8 19 .1i.e3 l:tac8 20 .1i.f3?!

which might be upsetting to either party, or it might be their intended result. However, you'll find that if they want to, one or both players can muddy the waters enough to get to a legitimate middlegame without undue risk. I include a brief description of the Exchange Variation in this volume because we have few representa tives of symmetrical opening play and because some typical Slav ideas arise. 4 tt'lc3 Unfortunately, there are any number of move-orders, so in the interests of brevity I'll just show a couple of the common resulting po sitions.

We're going to be looking at the position that arises after 1 d4 d5 2 c4 c6 3 tbf3 l2lf6 4 tbc3 e6 (the Semi-Slav) 5 e3 lbbd7. Both sides should be familiar with the various options that arise
98 MASTERING THE CHESS OPENINGS
along the way, including move-orders that lead to the same endpoint. First, the move-order 2 ...e6 (D) is often used to get to the Semi-Slav, if Black wants to delay ... lt:Jf6 on the third move. That is, Black can get to the desired Semi Slav position by playing 2 c4 e6 3 lt:Jc3 c6 4 lt:Jf3 l2Bf6 5 e3 lt:Jbd7. Why would he want to play 2 ...e6 first, and then 3 ...c6? Because once White is committed to 3 l2Bc3, Black has gained in several ways: a) He has eliminated any line in which White plays lt:Jd2; b) He has helped himself in certain varia tions with ... dxc4 and ...b5, because ... b4 will then attack the knight on c3 with tempo. c) Finally, Black may be happier playing the unbalanced pawn-structure that results from 2 c4 e6 3 cxd5 exd5 than the symmetrical one af ter 2 c4 c6 3 cxd5 cxd5. All that sounds good, but there's always a trade-off. One drawback to this order is that it allows the Marshall Gambit, 4 e4. See the note on that below. A further move-order that avoids both the Exchange Slav and the Marshall Gam bit is 1 d4 l2Bf6 2 c4 e6 3 l2Bf3 d5 4 lt:Jc3 c6. The trade-off then is that Black needs to be willing to play a Nimzo-Indian. 3 lt:Jc3 3 lt:Jf3 might discourage the idea of delaying ... lt:Jf6 because White can try 3 ...e6 4 ii.g5 ! ?, a rather obscure but interesting option. This would also not be possible with the 2 c4 e6 3 lt:Jc3 or der. I'm not going to give you the details about all these choices, but want to make you aware of what's out there so that you can reflect upon what suits you best. 3 ...e6 3 ...l2Bf6 4 l2Bf3 e6 transposes to the main po- sition of the Semi-Slav. Other options are con sidered in the introductory notes to 3 l2Bc3 at the beginning of this chapter. 4 lt:Jf3 An alternative is the Marshall Gambit, 4 e4 ! ?
(D).
This usually leads to the gambit 4 ...dxe4 5 l2Bxe4 ii.b4+ 6 ii.d2 'ifxd4 7 ii.xb4 'ifxe4+, when Black is a pawn up but has lost the dark squares. This is a sharp variation to which a very large amount of concrete theory has been devoted; it should probably be learned by heart. I won't go into the details here, but so far it has not deterred top players from using this move order as Black. On the other hand it seems that White is always coming up with new ideas, and the gambit may suit players who enjoy specula tive attacks. There is also a positional way to answer the Marshall Gambit, namely, 4 ... ii.b4 (D).

The resulting play is very instructive and will often bear a resemblance to variations of the French Defence.

It's fair to call this position dynamically equal. White has space, dark squares, and the bishop pair. Black can either put pressure on the d pawn (by ... cxd4, ...

f6 (D) The combined moves ...e6 and ...c6 give us what is called the Semi-Slav Variation. It has become one of the most fertile areas for investi gation in modem chess play. But what is going on here? First Black denies c6 to his knight and then blocks the open diagonal for his bishop on c8! Why? Obviously the answer cannot be rapid development, because he's making pawn moves. And although Black has a strong point at dS (every one of his moves, including 1 . . .dS, has increased control of that square), White has more space and better control of the centre as a whole. In general Black's position has to strike one as passive. And yet the Semi-Slav is associ ated with extraordinarily exciting play. Let's see why. In the first place, Black has a threat:
S ...
dxc4, after which his pawn on c4 can be de fended by ...bS. To see that this is actually a threat, take a look at the move S g3 below, which turns into a gambit (not a terrible one, but still not to most people's taste). So White needs to do something that prevents, neutral izes, or compensates for the capture on c4. The obvious move for that purpose is: 5 e3 This is the main line that we shall explore. I'll get to S ii.gs in a short note below. Other moves have their disadvantages which are en lightening to look through, especially to under stand why the main lines are main lines. Here are a few that may be of value in that respect: a) S a4 (to prevent . .. bS should Black decide upon ...dxc4), when Black can simply develop by, e.g., S ...
0..bd7, or exploit the new hole on b4
by S ... ii.b4 (with ... tb.e4 and perhaps . . . 'WiaS in mind) 6 i.d2 O-O (or 6 ... cS) 7 e3 cS. This ex ploits White's passively-placed bishop on d2, which is disconnected from the defence of d4. Black intends to play ... tb.c6 and capture on d4, whereas 8 dxcS tb.c6 takes over the centre; e.g., 9 cxdS exdS 10 ii.e2 ii.xcS 1 1 O-O l:te8 with ideal activity for an isolated queen's pawn posi tion. b) S 'Wib3 defends the c-pawn with the hope of developing via ii.f4 or ii.gs. It can be met by simple development such as ...
0..bd7, but the
forcing sequence S ... dxc4 6 'ii xc4 bS ! is sur prisingly effective and has more or less elimi nated S 'Wib3 as an attempt to gain the advantage (the same applies to S 'Wid3 dxc4; in that case Black has another good option in S 'ii d3 b6!). The play can proceed 7 'ii d3 b4! ? 8 tb.e4 tb.xe4 9 'Wixe4 ii.b7 10 e3 tb.d7 1 1 ii.c4 ii.e7 12 O-O O-O with equality, Korchnoi-Tischbierek, Zu rich 1 999. c) S g3 dxc4 6 ii. g2 (D) can tum into a real gambit. 6 .. .

He has two other moves within the Semi-Slav complex. One is S ...h6, which can in tum lead to 6 ii.xf6 '¥Vxf6, the Moscow Variation, or 6 ii.h4 dxc4 7 e4 gS 8 ii.g3 bS, known as the 'Anti-Moscow' Variation (see the next paragraph). The Mos cow is strategically interesting, but I think less so than the Meran and Anti-Meran, to which I'll be devoting my attention. I have given one example of the Moscow Variation in Chapter 3 in the first volume. The other and most popular move after S ii.gs is S ... dxc4, usually leading to 6 e4 bS (Black holds on to his extra pawn; else White plays ii.xc4 with the ideal centre and better de velopment). We enter the main line of the infa mous 'Botvinnik Variation' once White plays 7 eS h6 8 ii.h4 gS 9 lt:JxgS ! hxgS 10 ii.xgS lt:Jbd7

This is one of the most thoroughly played and analysed variations in modem chess. It is characterized by lengthy tactical and sacrificial sequences, with play in which half a tempo changes the entire nature of the game. Many fans and specialists devote their time to study ing and extending Botvinnik Variation theory, and it would do you no good for me to rehash a selected fraction of it, since to master these lines on either side of the board requires a great deal of playing experience and very specific study of tactical sequences. The Anti-Moscow above (S ...h6 6 ii.h4 gS 7 ii.g3 dxc4 8 e4 bS) is of the same nature, being extremely theoretical. It's not yet worked out to the outrageous extent that various Botvinnik lines are (30+ moves), but it's still dependent upon hoards of posi tion-specific tactics. Neither variation is within the scope or intent of this book, but that should not discourage a lover of fascinating chess the ory. 5 . . . lt:Jbd7 (D)
SIA V AND SEMI-SIA V 101
The natural 5 ... lbbd7 introduces the stan dard Semi-Slav lines that we'll examine. It is very flexible, allowing for Black's bishop on f8 to go to e7, d6 or b4. In the meantime, Black de velops a piece and supports either ...c5 or ... e5 should the opportunity arise. Before moving to what White plays next, let's examine the Semi-Slav from another per spective. Take the moves 1 d4 d5 2 lZ'Bf3 lZ'Bf6 3 e3 e6 4 c3 c5 5 lZ'ibd2 lZ'Bc6 6 i.d3 (D). Do you recognize this position? It's the Clas sical Colle System, considered one of White's dullest variations in d-pawn chess! The Classi cal Colle is sound enough, but grandmasters rarely play it, and indeed I'm not sure that a top-ten player has tried to play this form of the Colle in decades. Ironically, the Colle System with the move b3 (omitting c3) has attracted a number of strong grandmasters over the last 15 years or so. But when one looks at the reversed Semi-Slav position, Black has forgone this pos sibility ...b6. So how can a notoriously dull opening be so popular with colours reversed, played a full tempo down? We'll discover some concrete reasons shortly, but more general is sues apply. The nature of reversed openings is such that Black' s goals can differ from White's in the same position. Obviously Black is usu ally satisfied with equality in a system where a dynamic imbalance cannot be achieved by force. Then, too, White has to commit himself to a specific 6th move versus the Semi-Slav set-up, giving Black some extra information with which to respond flexibly by choosing the appropriate counter. Let's continue with our Colle example (from the diagram after 6 i.d3): sometimes Black plays 6 ... i.d6 (6 ... Wi/c7 7 dxc5 i.xc5 8 b4 i.d6 is a better version for Black, but we're continu ing with the analogy) 7 dxc5 i.xc5 8 b4 i.d6
(D).
Here it might be useful to jump ahead and glance at the first few moves of the Meran Vari ation main lines below. In this position (after 8 ... i.d6), Black, who is a tempo down on the Semi-Slav lines, will not play ambitiously with . . .e5 as White does in the Meran Variation. Rather, he will play something like ... lbe5, or ... a5, answering b5 with . . . lbe5. Such a strat egy is certainly dull, but it should equalize. That's the difference between a counterattack whose basis is the opponent's aggression (in the Meran, White usually plays for advantage with e4-e5 and exposes himself to attack), and Black's willingness to play more solidly in or der to equalize in the reversed position. Now we return to the subject of this section,
5 e3 lZ'ibd7. At this point White has two moves
102 MASTERING THE CHESS OPENINGS
that we'll look at: 6 i.d3 (with 6 ...dxc4), the Meran System; and 6 �c2, the Anti-Meran System. The Meran 6 i.d3 dxc4 7 i.xc4 b5 (D) This sequence of moves defines the Meran System. 8 ..lild3 What is going on here? Briefly, White has a central majority, and given the chance, will play e4 followed by moves such as i.g5, �e2 and the like. Or perhaps he will go for e5, lZ'Be4 and ..lilg5. Thus White's play will be fairly transparent unless he is challenged in the cen tre. Sometimes the time-consuming move a3 might be mixed in, to counter ...b4. The some what better idea of a4 is positionally desirable, but has the particular drawback of taking away the a4-square for the knight after ...b4. With 7 ...b5, Black has advanced a pawn that can be used to drive White's knight away from c3, from which position it controls e4 and influ ences the centre. The pawn on b4 might prove weak and the squares c5 and c6 may be vulner able if Black doesn't quickly assert himself on the queenside. Ideally, Black would like to counter White's plan of e4 by a combination of bothersome moves like ...b4, ... ..lilb7 and . . .c5, focusing his counterattack upon d4 and e4. In some lines he can afford the time for . . .a6 and ...c5, and if White doesn't try for much, then ...i.d6 followed by ...e5 can be effective. In the position after 7 .. .b5, we'll be looking mainly at the move 8 i.d3. 8 i.b3 isn't played much, primarily due to 8 ...b4 and 9 lba4?! (a move which is normally desirable in order to control c5) 9 ... i.a6! (preventing 10 O-O), or 9 lZ'Be2 i.b7 followed by ... i.d6, ...O-O and ...c5. However, 8 i.e2 (D) is an important option, keeping the bishop out of the way of various at tacks by ...c4 and ...e4 while keeping the d pawn in sight of the queen. Its drawback is a lack of central protection, i.e., after White plays e4 his pawn has limited support. Nevertheless, White will have to play e4 soon or he' ll have no chance for advantage because Black will imple ment a plan with ...c5 or ...e5.

I'll examine 8 ...a6 and 8 ... i.b7. 8 ... Wi/c7 is a good transpositional tool, but it's easier to present the material via the other two moves. Classical Meran 8 ... a6 (D) This is the traditional move, preparing ...c5. White can try to take advantage of Black's lack of development by attacking with his central majority. 9 e4 Pedersen gives a 'rule of thumb' that ...a6 in the Semi-Slav should be met by e4. Oddly enough, White already gives up all chances for advantage after 9 O-O c5, when 1 0 Wi/e2 is a sort of Queen's Gambit Accepted with a harmless reputation and 10 a4 b4 at best transposes to the next note but also gives Black options of ... i.d6 instead of ... i.e7.

c5 (D) 9 . . .b4? ! 1 0 lba4 transposes to a Modern Meran (which we'll be looking at below) ex cept that Black has spent a move on . . .a6, which is less than optimal for that variation. You' ll have to bear with me on these compari sons and transpositions. It isn't necessary to know them, but you might want to return here after you have played some games and want to make sense of them. We come to a crossroads. White can play 1 0 d5 or 1 0 e5. Reynolds Attack 10 d5 This introduces the wild Reynolds Variation, ideal for specialists or for anyone who thinks that his opponent won't be prepared for it! The move d5 is always critical in such positions be cause it opens lines for White's pieces to work with. The positional basis for d5 also stems from the fact that if White waits for ...cxd4, both Black's bishop on f8 and knight on d7 will have active posts, whereas now they are lim ited by their c-pawn. Variations stemming from 1 0 d5 constantly interact with those beginning with the moves 8 ... i.b7 and 8 ... Wi/c7, so I'll mix the material. 10 .•• 'ifc7 The most 'flexible' move. Unfortunately, it's hard to decide upon which move should be played first. For example, White can toss in the exchange of pawns dxe6 and . . .fxe6 just about anywhere. Fortunately we're more concerned with the resulting positions than the details of how to get there. Of course there are alterna tives, such as 1 0. .. c4, which very often trans poses to 1 0. ..

This basic advantage is signifi cant, and such attacks do sometimes succeed, but they are rendered difficult by Black's out post on d5 and lack of weaknesses. Further more, Black's position is superior in almost every other respect. Compare the knight on d5 to the ones on f3 and a4, or Black's powerful bishop on b7 to White's bad bishop on g5 (about to be driven away should Black want to). Black's queen is also very active, whereas White's is tied to a4. All in all, it's not surpris ing that variations with this kind of position have grown increasingly attractive to Black.

There's a subtle point here: White is now allowing the same move ... dxc4 (with the loss of tempo that entails), precisely what he avoided when he played 6 �c2. It turns out that Black's bishop on d6 doesn't go well with ...dxc4 and ...b5. For one thing, White's advance e4 will threaten e5, forking the bishop and knight. Before investigating that, here are some al ternatives: a) 7 Sld3 is another common order for White, when 7 ...O-O 8 O-O dxc4 9 ilxc4 trans poses to the main line. But 7 Sld3 has the seri ous drawback that Black seems to equalize if he knows his stuff after 8 ...e5, answering 9 cxd5 with 9 ...cxd5. b) 7 e4 is pretty well worked-out, the most entertaining line going 7 ...dxe4 8 CLJxe4 lLixe4 9 �xe4 e5 10 dxe5 O-O! 1 1 exd6 .l::t e8 12 �xe8+ �xe8+ 1 3 Sle3 with a kind of material equality after which Black can easily go wrong but may even stand slightly better if he plays accurately. Not surprisingly, there are other ways to equal ize. c) 7 Sld2, intending to castle queenside fol lowed by an attack, comes across the most problems in the line 7 ... O-O 8 O-O-O b5!, intend ing 9 cxb5 c5 ! with a strong queenside attack. This line could use more attention, however. d) 7 b3 is solid and interesting but fairly easy to meet.

aggressive and exciting way to attack the Semi Slav once you've played 6 �c2. Naturally this comes with considerable risk, since 7 g4 sacri fices the g-pawn temporarily (or permanently in some lines), and weakens the kingside. The initial idea is to meet 7 ... lllxg4 with 8 I:!.g l and, after the knight moves, play I:!.xg7. Barring Black' s acceptance of the pawn by ... lll xg4, White has gained space and hopes either to drive away the knight on f6 or, if Black defends by ...h6, to enforce g5 and open lines. His over all strategy is to play for O-O-O and (usually) e4. Black has a large choice of counter-strategies, including variations in which he plays for an early ...e5, which is in line with the old saying about flank attacks being best answered by cen tral attacks. Alternatively, Black has had mixed success with an attempt to control e4 by 7 ... .tb4, and he can also develop slowly by ...b6 and . . . 3l.b7. Sadly the initially anarchic 7 g4 has turned into a highly theoretical line with a heavy dose of tactics and forcing lines, so those who are tempted to play it should be sure to devote a lot of study time to its intricacies. As Black, you should master at least one defensive solution. In contemporary chess we find a strong dis position towards playing g4 in many openings, even in situations where it would previously have been thought to be an amateurish error. The Sicilian Defence stands out in this respect, but the move has cropped up all over the theo retical spectrum. It was undoubtedly the suc cess of 7 g4 in the anti-Meran that gave impetus to this surge of similar ideas. Such sharing of ideas constitutes one of the most striking in stances of the 'cross-pollination', a subject that I discuss in the first volume. We tum to a game with 7 .te2 (D): Karpov - Anand Brussels Ct (8) 1991 For this positionally-oriented variation, am not presenting current theoretical lines but games that show the most important ideas, or at least a clear contrast of strategies. This game in particular has been eclipsed by various refine ments, yet the players' overall handling of the position holds up perfectly well. 7 ...

4 Introduction to the Indian Defences
The Indian Defences to 1 d4 are at the heart of modem chess theory. The Indian systems that I shall be covering all begin with 1 ...lll f6. This de velopment of the knight stakes out a claim to e4 and forestalls White's intended occupation of that square. Other first moves such as 1 . .. c5 and l . ..d6 may lead to forms of lndian Systems, and the Dutch Defence with 1...f5 is another method of impeding 2 e4. I feel that it belongs in its own category, with the exception of an infrequent side-variation, sometimes called the 'Dutch In dian', which involves 1 . . .e6 and ... .tb4+ at an early stage. After 1 ... lllf6 we see the move 2 c4 (D) in the clear majority games by masters. By this move White inhibits 2 ... d5 and prepares 3 lllc3 with out blocking his c-pawn. The second most pop ular move 2 lll f3 will often be followed by c4 on one of the next few moves, sharing the same basic idea. Experience has shown that 2 lllc3 lacks the punch to threaten Black's position, mainly because it isn't possible to enforce e4 after 2 ... d5. However, I should say that this is a result of specifics and not of inviolable princi ples. The idea that one shouldn't block the c pawn in 1 d4 openings has its exceptions; a cou ple occur as early as the second move, as in the Dutch Defence variation that goes 1 d4 f5 2 lll c3 and the Chigorin Defence, 1 d4 d5 2 c4 lll c6. At this point (following 2 c4), White would like to play e4, establishing a broad centre and laying claim to central space. Black must de cide upon a strategy. He can directly thwart that advance by, for example, controlling the e4- and d5-squares; e.g., 2 ...e6 3 lll c3 .tb4 (the Nimzo-Indian Defence) or here 3 lllf3 b6 and ...3l.b7 (the Queen's Indian Defence). Alterna tively, he can allow White to play e4, setting up his strong pawn-centre. The establishment of an ideal centre would seem to be the goal of all openings and therefore advantageous for White. But for White's centre pawns to give him the advantage two things must hold true: a) The pawns must actually control the cen tral squares, which is usually the case against the Indian Defences. b) They must be secure against dissolution, which may or may not be the case in the Indian Defences. Thus Black plans to attack White's centre and/or to arrange things such that any advance by White backfires. Even in the latter case he must eventually attack and compromise White's centre or suffer under a cramped and probably untenable situation. The strategy just described is usually introduced by ... g6 in conjunction with either ...d6 (the King's Indian Defence), ... d5 (the Griinfeld Defence) or ...c5 (the Ben oni). The latter is a sort of hybrid solution, since 2 ...c5 (threatening to impair White's centre by ...cxd4) already allows the incursion of White's pawn to d5, and e4 will follow if White wishes. Whether White's centre has been strengthened or weakened thereby is open to dispute. Let's take a quick look at how the major In dian defences unfold in the first few moves. The King's Indian Defence ( 1 d4 lllf6 2 c4 g6 3 lllc3 3l.g7; e.g., 4 e4 d6 5 lllf3 O-O) is in one sense the most radical one: it doesn't put a piece or pawn on the fourth rank for the first five moves ! That phenomenon doesn't usually continue further, although we have some funny lines in the KID like the Panno System with 4
INTRODUCTION TO THE [ND/AN DEFENCES 115
ctJf3 d6 5 g3 O-O 6 j_g2 tll c6 7 O-O a6 followed by 8 ... .l::t b8 and often 9 ... j_d7, in which case Black has gone 9 moves without placing any thing beyond his third rank. When Black in stead plays his usual ...e5 at an early stage, he blocks off his own bishop, but creates a di lemma for White about how to react. At first sight the Griinfeld Defence ( 1 d4 ctJf6 2 c4 g6 3 tllc3 d5) is superior to the King ' s Indian in vi tal respects: the move ... d5 directly challenges White's centre, so that Black gains some space to work with. His bishop on g7 will be un blocked and remain so indefinitely, sometimes well into the endgame. In conjunction with the moves ...c5 and ... tll c6, for example, the queen on d8 and the bishop on g7 exert strong pres sure upon the key d4-square (the move ... 3l.g4 can also come in handy in that respect if White has a knight on f3). In reality, White is compen sated due to some specific features of play. If White plays 4 cxd5 tllxd5 and then makes the principled move e4, then either Black' s knight must retreat, giving White time to bolster his ideal centre, or the knight has to exchange on c3, when of a sudden White has shored up d4 with a pawn and is able to fight for control of that square. The outcome of that engagement, combined with some other factors, produces a competitive balance which attract players on both sides of the Indian Systems. The Nimzo-lndian was the first of the In dian openings that really caught on among the world's top players, and it's easy to see why, The Nimzo-Indian combines rapid develop ment with central control, to the extent that Black may even be said to be on equal footing with White in the centre proper (depending upon the variation, of course). Furthermore, he faces only rare situations like those in the King's Indian and Griinfeld in which White has a formidable set of pawns on e4 and d4. One might complain that Black therefore has no particular target, but the main action results from the exchange . . . 3l.xc3, which cedes the bishop-pair to White but often saddles him with doubled c-pawns. The Queen's Indian Defence also deploys Black's forces so as to control e4 and d5. Black receives a bit of a break in that regard because White's 3 ctJf3 not only fails to control e4 and d5, but interferes with potential central occu pation that might follow from White's moves f3 and e4. Thus the Queen's Indian has been considered a safe and solid defence. You should keep in mind, however, that White con trols more space, and surprisingly dynamic play can result from the natural imbalance that entails. The Modem Benoni involves a different set of issues. On the positive side, Black has the quasi-permanent advantages of a powerful, un obstructed bishop on g7 and an open and very useful e-file. But unlike practitioners of the other Indian Defences, he faces a powerful and almost irremovable pawn on d5 that restricts his mobility and development. Of course there is much more to say about the Indian Defences in general, but the real dif ferences and similarities are best shown in their individual contexts.
5 Nimzo- lndian Defence
1 d4 lll
f6 2 c4 e6 2 ... e6 is a quintessentially flexible move that leaves Black's options open while increasing his control over d5. Now he has several ways to prevent White's key move e4. He can: a) play . . . d5 (usually transposing to the Queen's Gambit Declined); b) develop by ...b6 and ... 3l.b7, to strengthen control of d5 and e4; or c) bring the f8-bishop to b4, either giving check or pinning a knight on c3. All of these moves focus on the central light squares, with the intention of precluding e4 by White. Even ... llle4 followed by ... f5 can contribute to this purpose. Note that the immediate 2 ...b6?! fails in this respect because White can play 3 lll c3 (or 3 f3) 3 ... 3l.b7 (3 ... d5 4 cxd5 lllxd5 5 e4 lllxc3 6 bxc3 isn't disastrous, but compares poorly with the Grtinfeld Defence of Chapter 8) 4 f3 (or 4 �c2 followed by e4) 4 ... d5 5 cxd5 (D).
B
After Black recaptures, there follows 6 e4. When White establishes the ideal e4/d4 centre and it isn't subject to an effective attack, you can be pretty sure that he' ll have the advantage. For this reason one hardly ever sees an experi enced player make the move 2 ... b6. We return to 2 ... e6 (D): 3 lllc3 This is the obvious move (to prepare the ad vance e4), but in fact White makes a major de cision thereby. 3 lllc3 allows Black to play 3 ... 3l.b4, pinning the knight. Whether White wants to allow this determines his choice of moves. The main alternative, very often played, is 3 lll f3; this also develops a piece and controls the important central squares d4 and e5. As we shall see in Chapter 6, 3 lllf3 has its own pluses and minuses. Refer to Chapter 2 for the impli cations of 3 lllf3 if Black chooses to play the Queen's Gambit Declined by 3 ... d5. Other third moves are either dubious or gen erally less ambitious. Sometimes it helps to look at weaker moves to understand the good ones. Here are some relatively logical continua tions for White: a) After 3 f3? ! d5 ! , White cannot manage to play e4 and thus has used up a move and taken away the best spot for White's knight on f3. An example of how the play might go is 4 lll c3 (this amounts to a poor version of the Queen's Gambit Declined) 4 ...c5 (Black strikes back in the centre, but he can also play 4 ... .te7) 5 cxd5 cxd4 ! (D). 6 �a4+ (6 �xd4 lllc6! takes advantage of White's pinned d-pawn to gain more time by at tacking White's queen) 6 ... lllbd7 (not the only move, but it shows up how weak White's dark squares are). Then White can choose between:

White would be temporarily a pawn ahead after 8 'iYdl exd5 9 lll xd5 lllxd5 1 0 �xd5 but things would tum sour after 1 0. ..�a5+!: 1 1 '>t>dl ( 1 1 3l.d2?? fails to l l . ...tf2+ 1 2 @xf2 �xd5) l l . ..lll f6 l 2 �e5+ 1'.e6 1 3 e4 .l:!.d8+ and there are too many pieces attacking White's king. This line serves as a warning about weakening pawn moves, the importance of piece activity and the risks of early queen development. b) 3 a3 prevents ... 3l.b4 but doesn't control a central square or develop a piece. Black can equalize immediately by playing 3 ... d5 (3 ...c5 is another aggressive move) 4 lll c3 c5 (or, of course, 4 .. . .te7, since White wouldn't play a3 in the first few moves of the Queen's Gambit Declined!) 5 e3 with equality, and not 5 tllf3 ? ! cxd4 6 lll xd4 dxc4 7 �a4+ 3l.d7 8 �xc4 lll c6, when Black has good development whereas White's queen is out there a bit early; for exam ple, ... .l:!.c8 might soon follow. Compare this with 1 d4 lllf6 2 c4 e6 3 lll f3 b6 4 a3. The differ ence in that case is that 4 ...d5, while playable, doesn't go well with the move ...b6. c) A much better move is 3 g3 preparing 1'.g2, which contests both e4 and d5. It's a little too slow to give White an advantage, but it can easily transpose to another opening; for exam ple, 3 . . . d5 4 lll f3 is a Catalan, comfortable enough for Black, and 3 . . .c5 4 d5 exd5 5 cxd5 d6 6 3l.g2 g6 is a Modem Benoni, analysed in the chapter on that opening. For those wanting an independent line, 3 ... .tb4+ is a good alter native, when Black is already prepared to cas tle. 3 ••. 3l.b4 (D) This move defines what is called the Nimzo Indian Defence. It is named after the brilliant and creative thinker Aron Nimzowitsch, who both played and had the most to do with pro moting 3 ... .tb4 in the early part of the 20th cen tury. The Nimzo-Indian has been played by just about every World Champion and nearly every challenger going back to the 1 920s. It is argu ably the most difficult opening to play against after l d4. Why 3 ... 3l.b4? The most obvious and impor tant answer is that it prevents White from play ing 4 e4. Let's make sure. The sequence 4 e4 lllxe4 5 'iYg4 isn't in books on chess theory, al though perhaps it should be in the opening primers, since White attacks both the e4-knight and the g7-pawn. The best reply is 5 ... lll xc3
(D).
118 MASTERING THE CHESS OPENINGS
Black threatens discovered check and the knight can't be captured. Still, White can try 6 a3 (6 'V//i xg7? tlle4+ 7 '>t>e2 'V//i f6 and Black re mains a piece ahead), when the trap that Black has to avoid is 6 ... 3l.a5? 7 'V//i xg7 tll e4+ 8 b4 and after Black defends his rook, his bishop will be captured. Instead, 6 ... 3l.e7 ! 7 bxc3 O-O leaves Black with an extra pawn and a great position. Thus 4 e4 deserves a '?' after all. These moves are good to play through if you are inexperi enced in the opening phase of the game. Similar ideas can arise in other openings including the Sicilian Defence and French Defence. Let's return to 3 ... 3l.b4. Apart from prevent ing e4, this move fights for control of the cen tral light squares. All three of Black's moves have directly or indirectly helped him control d5, and two of them have done the same for e4. This emphasis on light squares is characteristic of most Nimzo-Indian variations, at least for the first five or six moves. For example, Black will frequently play ...b6 and ... 3l.b7 next, also watching over the d5- and e4-squares. That's not all. Whether or not Black chooses to play ...b6, he has other light-square themes. The move ... d5 is a part of many variations, staking further claim to e4 and adding the queen to the mob of pieces defending d5. In addition, occupation of the light squares by ... tll e4 is common, followed by .. .f5 to cement control of e4. Chess being what it is, of course, this delight fully simple picture proves deceptively com plex as Black may later tum to moves such as
[diagram]
tllc6, ...d6 and ...e5 in order to challenge or defend dark squares ! Still, the abundance of light-square themes lends a distinctive charac ter to Nimzo-Indian play that often extends well into the middlegame. One of the most obvious features of 3 ... 3l.b4 is that it introduces the possibility of ... 3l.xc3+, giving White doubled pawns. As we discussed in the introductory chapters of Volume 1 , those doubled pawns are particularly bad because the forward pawn on c4 is incapable of being de fended by pawns, and it can easily be attacked (see below). The better part of Nimzo-Indian variations have one or more points at which ... 3l.xc3 is the best move. However, that capture usually comes at the cost of giving White the bishop-pair. In some cases White also takes command of the centre, although if embarked upon too early, the occupation of the centre may have drawbacks, such as queenside weak nesses, overextension, or simply the inability to exploit extra space. Another advantage that Black has is speedy development in the first few moves. After his third move he is already ready to castle, whereas White has quite a few moves to go, perhaps e3 followed by 3l.d3, tllf3 and O-O. In the meantime, he may throw in moves such as a3 and 'V//i c2, which don't con tribute much to getting White' s pieces out. Thus White's policy in most variations is a cautious consolidation of his position involving protection of his centre and development. Black would like to disturb the position's balance in his favour, usually combining piece-play with one or more pawn-breaks. White almost inevi tably has to make pawn-structure concessions, either the aforementioned doubled c-pawns, an isolated pawn, weak light squares on the queen side, or loss of space in the centre as Black ad vances. The issue becomes whether the situation stabilizes enough for White's bishop-pair to ex ert itself, in which case Black can be in real trouble. The bishops' merits vary from position to position; we'll see both how ineffectual they can be in some of the variations that follow, and how devastating in others. Samisch and Related Lines Under this heading we shall be covering lines where White plays an early a3, and Black cap tures on c3, doubling White's pawns. There are several forms that this can take, depending on whether White plays a3 immediately, or after 4 f3 or 4 e3, often waiting until Black has played ... d5 before playing a3. The traditional form of the Samisch is as follows:
1 d4 ctJf6 2 c4 e6 3 tllc3 3l.b4 4 a3!? 3l.xc3+
5 bxc3 (D) The Samisch Variation is in many ways the most instructive of all Nimzo-Indian lines. It seems odd to force Black into ... 3l.xc3+, a move that he is likely to play anyway, and thus to ac cept the weak doubled c-pawns while losing time. For some rather subtle reasons, however, it turns out that there are advantages to forcing Black to commit to a strategy before he can
NIMZO-[NDIAN DEFENCE 119
react to White' s. Indeed, 4 a3 was one of the earliest methods of play versus the Nimzo Indian and many of the best players of the time, including the long-time World Champion Bot vinnik, were infatuated with possession of the bishop-pair. Remember that having two bishops versus a bishop and a knight, or two bishops versus two knights, is generally advantageous, although you have to assess each case individu ally (especially in this opening). White ' s idea is to compel Black to part with his bishop before he changes his mind and retreats, something that occurs in other lines. In contemporary chess, both 4 a3 and its cousin 4 f3 have once again become quite popular. Similarly, White can follow up the move 4 e3 with 5 a3, or even 5 3l.d3 and 6 a3, often producing the same basic structure. As mentioned above, the motivation for this is often to wait for Black to commit him self to playing ...d5. The reason for this is that some of the most challenging lines at Black' s disposal against the 4 a3 move-order involve him avoiding ... d5 and attacking White's c4- pa wn with his pieces. The Samisch Variation is the ideal starting point for discussing the Nimzo-lndian because it contains a majority of the fundamental themes that arise from the opening. On a simple level, we may say that the strategies resulting from 4 a3 can usually be characterized as one of the following: a) White undertakes to gain ground with his central and kingside pawns, creating threats or forming a basis for a direct attack by pieces. Typically this involves ideas such as f3 and e4 (or g4, which also grabs space), e4-e5 and/or f4-f5-f6. For his part, Black attempts to block those pawns with his own, usually with moves like ...e5 and/or .. .f5. b) White tries to activate his bishop-pair, which requires line-opening pawn advances or exchanges. Black endeavours to restrict White's bishops to passive roles behind their own pawns. c) Black wants to win White's weak for ward c-pawn or expose his weaknesses on the key queenside light squares. He tends to ex change pieces in order to neutralize White's kingside efforts. White can either strain to pro tect his weak c4-pawn with pieces, or sacrifice it for activity. d) Alternatively, Black will play moves to contest the centre: either ... d5, or some combi- nation of ... d6, ...e5 and ... c5. Then he can even think about initiating play on the kingside. I shall devote an exceptional amount of space to exploring these schemes. They will play out in the following variations: A: Systems with ...d6 and ...e5; B : Systems with ... d5; C: Systems with ...c5 and/or ... b6. As this is a book of ideas, the latest theory will not always be covered (the last section is exceptional in that respect), and I'll be using some classic games that throw the strategies and set-ups into relief. Before moving ahead I shall very briefly mention a curious move: 5 . . . llle4 (D) This received several tests in the 1 96 1 World Championship match between Tal and Botvin nik, the latter playing White. Black attacks White's c3-pawn but this ad vanced knight is subject to being driven back

Af ter trying a variety of moves, Botvinnik found a fairly effective one:

may be more accurate. Nevertheless, White can play 7 1'.d3 f5 8 lll e2, when White will soon play f3 and chase Black's knight away with a central advance in store. 7 �h5+! g6 8 �h6 Now Black's kingside squares are a tad weak by virtue of his 3rd and 5th moves. 8 ...d6 8 ...

This is an instructive queenless middlegame (not ending!) because Black is far away from mounting an attack on White's c4-pawn (in fact, c5 may become an option for White at some point) and his dark squares are weak. White's two bishops and centre wield consider able influence and guarantee some advantage.

See how the two bish ops cooperate with the centre and queenside. Lines with . . .d6 and . . .es When the Nimzo-Indian Defence and Samisch Variation became respectable in the 1 920s and 1 930s, one of the first ideas that Black em ployed involved the moves ...d6 and ...e5. This made eminent sense: why not prevent White from expanding in the centre before one turns one's attention to the queenside and its more or-less permanent weaknesses? White's response to that question is to use his space in the centre to support an attack on Black's kingside. This is a difficult task. How ever, since Black is playing in the centre instead of attacking on the queenside, White's pieces will be relieved of their duty to protect his queenside (in particular, Black is not attacking White's pawn on c4 by means of ...b6 and . ...ta6; later on you will see that this is a major strategy). Notice too that the ...d6/ ... e5 defence already shifts the focus of the game from the central light squares to central dark squares. Al though the combination of ...d6 and ...e5 is seen less frequently than in earlier times, it still con stitutes a legitimate answer to White's ideas. What's more, the same structure arises in other variations of the Nimzo-lndian. Let's start with two older games, because they contain mistakes that illustrate important themes. Gligoric - Plater Warsaw 1947

f6 2 c4 e6 3 lll c3 3l.b4 4 a3 .txc3+ 5 bxc3 d6!? 6 f3 White intends e4. Capablanca once played 6 �c2?!, with the same goal, versus Ragozin in Moscow 1935. It turns out that this is inaccu rate, because Black could have grabbed the op portunity to generate counterplay against the centre by 6 ...e5 7 e4 lll c6! . The point is that White's 6th move has taken protection away
NIMZO-INDIAN DEFENCE 121
from his d-pawn. Now he hasn't time for .i.d3, and 8 d5 li:Jb8 ! 9 .i.d3 li:Ja6 (D) (or 9 ... li:Jbd7) lets Black take over the inviting c5-square for his knight. Indeed, the c5-square is a 'true' out post, in that it can't be attacked by enemy pawns: In this position it will prove difficult for White to organize any pawn-breaks, since f4 will be met by ...exf4 with additional Black firepower along the e-file aimed at the back ward pawn on e4. Furthermore, the a4-square is an inviting target for Black, who can play . . . .lld7 and ... 'iVe8 at some point, complement ing a knight on c5. Another theme that we shall see throughout this chapter concerns the possi- ble move ...c6. Here Black may play ...c6 and . . .cxd5 to open the c-file for his rook ( ... l:!.c8), which puts considerable pressure on White's pawns on that file. This all stems from the inac curacy 6 'iVc2. Of course White's position isn't hopeless. He can still play for lt:Je2 and lt:Jg3 or f4 at some point. But the timing of all this is delicate. After 6 'iVc2, Ragozin actually played 6 .. .O-O?! 7 e4 e5 8 .ll d3 ! c5 ! ? (now 8 ... lt:Jc6 9 lt:Je2 ! holds the centre together nicely) 9 li:Je2 lt:Jc6 10 d5 lt:Je7 1 1 f3 li:Jd7 1 2 h4 (here's the problem: left to his own devices White will launch his pawns for ward to take over as much space as he can; then he can mount an attack) 1 2. . . li:Jb6 1 3 g4 ! (D). Compare this with the last diagram: Black has lost his outpost on c5 and can't play ...c6 to create pressure on the queenside. Staking out as much space as possible is a key element of White's strategy in the Samisch. The game con tinued 1 3. . .f6 14 lt:Jg3 <;t>f7 ! 15 g5 lt:Jg8 16 f4 <;t>e8 1 7 f5. Black' s king has escaped but his pieces are confined to the first few ranks and he stands poorly. 6 ...O-O 7 e4 e5 8 .i.d3 c5!? Black's choice is important. He tries to force things in the centre and on the queenside but it's nice to have ...c6 in reserve; for example, 8 ... lt:Jc6 9 li:Je2 h6 (versus .i.g5) 10 d5? ! lt:Ja5 1 1 .i.e3 b6 1 2 lt:Jg3 .i.a6 1 3 'iVe2 c6! 1 4 O-O l:!.c8
(D).
In that case Black can attack along the c-file by exchanging pawns to control the c4-square. Had he played ...c5, he would have run out of pieces able to attack White's pawn on c4. Of course, l 0 d5 wasn't forced. 9 lt:Je2 lt:Jc6 10 O-O ! ? An intentional pawn sacrifice.

The question is whether Black should stand pat or win a pawn and liquidate White's centre. If you play either side of the Samisch or another Nimzo-Indian variation involving e3 and ...c5,
122 MASTERING THE CHESS OPENINGS
you will run into this issue. Accepting the sacri fice might lead to a line such as 1 0. .. cxd4 1 1 cxd4 exd4 ( l 1 ...li:Jxd4 1 2 lt:Jxd4 exd4 1 3 .i.b2 �6 14 'iVd2 ! , and in most cases 'iVf2 recovers the pawn, with White having mobile bishops on open lines) 1 2 l:!.bl (or 1 2 .i.g5 h6 1 3 .i.h4 g5 14 .i.f2) 12 ... lt:Jd7 1 3 .i.b2 li:Jc5 14 li:Jxd4 li:Jxd3 1 5 'iVxd3 (D). What's going on in such positions? You'll notice that White has a weak pawn on c4 but Black has problems with his vulnerable d-pawn. White has the more powerful bishop and pros pects of advancing his pawns on the kingside. In general, Black should only win the pawn on d4 if he can hang on to it or otherwise achieve immediate counterplay. 11 .i.g5! .i.a6 12 f4! Here we have a basic idea that applies to this kind of centre: Black should not normally 'mix systems' when he has played ...e5 by trying to attack White's c-pawns at the same time. Since Black's centre and kingside need to be continu ally monitored, it's risky to park a bishop on a6 and/or a knight on a5, away from the kingside action. Below we shall see a more sophisticated defence involving the same queenside moves but without ...d6 and ...e5.

Black plays what may seem the most natural move on the board (though is not so common via this precise move-order), staking out terri tory in the centre to neutralize White's usual advantage in space. True, White can and usu ally will 'undouble' his pawns by cxd5, but that has some drawbacks after the simple reply . . .exd5: a) it frees Black's bad bishop on c8; and b) gives his king's rook good scope along an open central file.
6 e3 (D)
This move reaches a position that is more of ten seen via the move-order 4 e3 d5 5 a3 .i.xc3+ 6 bxc3. In that sequence, White doesn't play a3 until Black is committed to ... d5. Instead of 6 e3, it's tempting to bring the queen's bishop out before shutting it in by e3. That brings us to our first example of ...d5 in the Samisch, an illustration of how White can go fundamentally wrong. Botvinnik - Kotov Groningen 1946

bxc3 d5 6 cxd5!? Now White could have achieved the normal position by 6 e3. See the next game.
6. ..exd5 7 .i.g5?! (D)
The strongest player in the world at that time shows us what not to do when playing his own system! White's logic is to place his dark squared 'bad' bishop outside the central pawn chain that will be formed by e3 and d4. How ever, this slows down the important development of his kingside and weakens White' s queenside dark squares.
7. .. c5!
A dynamic response. Black has ... 'iVa5 in mind, hitting the c3-pawn and unpinning the knight on f6. 7 ... h6 is also not a bad move, be cause if White plays 8 .ll xf6 'iVxf6, he loses his most important asset, the bishop-pair. Never theless, Black would have used the extra tempo ...h6 to achieve this and the position would be objectively equal, with a technical battle in store. By the way, the obvious alternative after 7 ...h6 is 8 .llh4, but that is even worse for White be cause it allows the direct attack 8 ...g5 9 .llg3 tt'Je4, when Black is attacking the c3-pawn and would like to threaten the g3-bishop by . . .h5 or play . . .c5 followed by ... 'iVa5. The point to re member here is that the rapid exertion of queenside pressure definitely outweighs the weaknesses created by ... h6 and ...g5. A useful old saying is "Weaknesses aren't weaknesses unless they can be attacked". This may not be 1 00% accurate, but is a good rule of thumb. 8 f3!? White tries to stop ... tt'Je4 and may have ideas of playing e4 later. The move f3 is always dangerous (great reward but great risk). The problem is that after the natural 8 e3, 8 ... 'iVa5 forces some awkward defence like 9 'iVc2 tt'Je4 10 .llf4 cxd4 1 1 exd4 tt'Jc6. Then Black is threatening ... tt'Jxd4 !, and 1 2 tt'Jf3 .i.g4! can be followed by ... .llxf3 and/or ... l:tc8, putting pres- sure on White's backward c-pawn. 1 2 tt'Je2 i.f5 is a perfect picture of light-square domination. 8 ... h6 9 .i.xf6 But now the dark squares are in trouble (look at that weakness on e3) !

6 e3 (D)
6 ... c5 Now for an important move-order issue. The position after 6 . . .c5 could also have oc curred via the common move-order 4 e3 d5 5 a3 .i.xc3+ 6 bxc3 c5 or 4 e3 c5 5 a3 .llxc3+ 6 bxc3 d5. In the move-order here, however, Black isn't already committed to . . .c5 and he doesn't have to play it yet (the trade-off, of course, is that in the 4 a3 move-order, Black is not committed to playing . . . d5). For example, he can insert 6 ...O-O, when 7 cxd5 exd5 8 .i.d3 b6 9 tt'Je2 .i.a6 tries to get the light-squared bishops off the board immediately. The obvi ous continuation for White is 1 0 O-O .i.xd3 1 1 �xd3. Then Black might play 1 1 . . .�c8 ! ? 1 2 f3 �a6, winning light squares like c4. But that simplification doesn't solve the problem of the centre after 1 3 �xa6 tt'Jxa6 1 4 tt'Jg3 (D). Then the advance e4 will follow, emphasizing the su periority of the white bishop over the poorly placed knight on a6. For example, 14 ... l:!.fe8 15 l:!.el c5 16 e4 dxe4 1 7 fxe4 cxd4 1 8 cxd4 l:!.ad8 1 9 .i.b2 tt'Jb8 20 l:!.ac l tt'Jbd7 2 1 l:!.c7 and White clearly has the upper hand. In general, space and mobility are
NIMZO-INDIAN DEFENCE 125
just as much advantages in queenless middle games as they are with queens still on the board. 7 cxd5 exd5 8 .i.d3 O-O 9 lt:Je2! (D) This move defines White's strategy. By de veloping the knight to e2 he gives his centre pawns the freedom to advance, namely, by f3 and e4, often supported by a knight on g3. In spite of White's lagging development, this set up tends to bring out the best in White's centre and bishop-pair. Placing a knight on f3 would allow Black to prevent e4 indefinitely. The arrangement of pieces and pawns after .lld3, lt:Je2, O-O and f3 was developed and popu larized by Botvinnik, and was used by him in one of his most famous victories, over Capa blanca in the AVRO 1 938 tournament. Since then many great players have employed it, in cluding Kasparov. 9 ... b6 10 O-O .i.a6 11 .llxa6 Many players prefer 1 1 f3 immediately. Then after 1 1 ....llxd3 1 2 �xd3, Black can develop his knight to a square other than a6, but White has prevented the useful manoeuvre ... lt:Ja6-c7. This trade-off of advantages is hard to assess. 11 ••. lt:Jxa6 12 f3! The beginning of a dynamic strategy to over run Black's position with pawns by e4-e5, f4- f5, etc. Right now it's time to see some general strategy by examining White's alternatives to the move 1 2 f3: a) The above-mentioned Botvinnik-Capa blanca, Rotterdam (AVRO) 1 938 was a seminal game, so we'll skip over the technical inaccura cies in the next few moves: 1 2 .i.b2?! �d7 ! 1 3 a4 ( 1 3 �d3 �a4! with the kind of queenside light-square control that White needs to avoid for as long as he can) 1 3. .. l:tfe8 1 4 �d3 c4? (D). With the benefit of hindsight just about every commentator agreed that this is a positional mistake because it gives up the option of ... cxd4 and releases the pressure on White's centre. Years of master games have confirmed that general view. Let's see how this works: 1 5 �c2 li:Jb8 1 6 l:!.ael lt:Jc6 1 7 lt:Jg3 lt:Ja5 1 8 f3 li:Jb3 (D).

NIMZO-INDIAN DEFENCE 12 7
14 l:.a2! ( D) Strange to say, this manoeuvre of the queen's rook to the centre may be the only way to play for advantage. Not only does White swing over to support the e4 push, he does so while still pre venting ... 'iVa4 and keeping his queen's bishop free to go in either direction. The idea of l:!.a2- e2 (or l:!.e2-f2) followed by e4 in this type of po sition goes back to the 1 940s and early 1 950s (at least in terms of consistent usage) and has become a standard part of White's weaponry in this and even a couple of other openings, notably Queen's Gambits. Sometimes l:!.a2 is played with the knight still on e2, in which case White has the new idea of g4 and tt'Jg3 with g5 and e4 to follow. Naturally Black has his own re sources, and in spite of most writers' and play ers' mistrust of his position he hasn't scored that much worse than in other variations. 14 ...l:.acS! (D) 15 'iVd3!? Perhaps more accurate is 1 5 l:!.e2, which has indeed played in a few games. Then Black's most successful idea has been 15 ...cxd4 16 cxd4 l:!.c4! (D) with double-edged play. White will have to place his bishop pas sively on b2 to enforce e4. Lutsko-Kveinys, Tallinn 2001 continued 17 'iVd3 b5 1 8 .i.b2 tt'Jc7 ! 19 e4 tt'Je6 (this standard defensive move hits f4 and d4) 20 l:.d2 tt'Jf4 2 1 'iVe3 tt'J6h5 22 tt'Jxh5 tt'Jxh5 23 g4? ! tt'Jf6 24 e5 'iVc6 25 l:.g2 tt'Jd7 with advantage to Black. 26 f4 would be met by 26 ... tt'Jf6 and ... tt'Je4, and 26 'iVd3 by 26 ... tt'Jb6! 27 f4 tt'Ja4.

In the meantime Black has a greater emphasis on preventative measures against attack by White. Many such variations arise via the move 4 f3; for example, 4 f3 d5 5 a3 .i.xc3+ 6 bxc3 O-O 7 cxd5 exd5 8 e3.

Currently, at least, White's ex tensive and varied efforts to gain an advantage in that position have proven fruitless, although a robust middlegame may ensue.

In spite of losing his dark-squared bishop, White enjoys control of the centre and king side. It turns out that his attack almost plays it self. 18 ••. bS 19 eS as 20 tZ:lhS WVb6 21 tt:Jf6+ gxf6 22 gxf6 @hs 23 WVh6 .l:!.g8+ 24 @hl tt::i rs 25 .l:!.gl lbg6 26 .l:!.gS 1-0 An interesting relationship exists between the same .itd3, lbge2, f3, lbg3 set-up that oc curs in the Nimzo-Indian and in the Exchange Queen's Gambit. In both cases White wants to use his central majority and enforce e4 fol lowed by e5. Of course, the bishop on g5 in the Queen's Gambit is outside the central pawn chain and seems to play a completely different part from that on b2 or c 1 in the Nimzo-Indian, especially when ..ltxf6 is played with . . . ..ltxf6 as a reply. In both cases, however, White's main idea is e4-e5 (driving a piece away from f6 with tempo), followed by f4-f5 . And there is another connection, as illustrated by this po sition: This comes from our section on the Ex change Queen's Gambit. The bishop has re treated from g5 to f2 via h4, in part to avoid a forced exchange that can occur if the bishop re mains on g5 too long (by ... lbh5 or ... tbg6 and ...h6, for example), but also in order to defend the e3/d4 centre and allow for e4. Isn't this pretty much the function of the 'bad' bishop on b2 in the Nimzo lines that we have just seen? In simi lar fashion, Black will play ...c5 to increase pres sure on d4 and discourage the key advance e4. In both openings White may well switch to an attack via g4. Obviously meaningful differences exist. In the QGD, Black hasn't exchanged his dark-squared bishop for a knight. But we see how White in the Nimzo-Indian can achieve an effective attack with surprisingly reduced ma terial, a prime example being the Botvinnik Capablanca game above . Sarni sch Main Line with . . .cs and . . . .i.a6 After the 4 a3 move-order, Black frequently adopts a set-up in which he doesn't move the d pawn or e-pawn, but plays to blockade White's potential advances on both sides of the board. This strategy has been strengthened by specific move-orders in recent years. First let's see how the issues evolved with practice.

bxc3 O-O For a few comments on this move-order, see the next section.
6 e3 c5
This fixes the forward doubled pawn on c4 as an easy target of attack and eliminates any idea of White freeing his pieces by pushing his pawn to c5. Amongst the large set of options in the Samisch (and Nimzo-lndian), Black has 6 .. .b6 7 .itd3 ..ltb7, when 8 f3 is the normal move and has had mixed results. Much more interesting is Vaganian's recent move 8 lbe2 ! ?, offering a promising gambit: 8 ... ..ltxg2 9 .l:!.gl .itf3 (if 9 ... ..lte4, then 10 lbg3 !) 10 .l:!.g3 ..lte4 1 1 f3 ..ltxd3 1 2 WUxd3 with compensation for the pawn. Nevertheless, both sides have chances for ad vantage. 7 .itd3 lbc6 8 lbe2 b6 9 e4 lbe8! (D)
132 MASTERING THE CHESS OPENINGS
At first sight this gives a strange impression: Black doesn't develop a piece and moves the knight backwards. The retreat is justified by three considerations: Black avoids the annoy ing pin ..ltg5, he prepares to answer f4 with .. .f5, and he manoeuvres the knight towards the d6- square from which point it will attack c4 again. An early game Bronstein-Najdorf, Budapest Ct 1 950 illustrates what not to do as Black: 1 d4 tZ:lf6 2 c4 e6 3 tbc3 ..ltb4 4 a3 ..ltxc3+ 5 bxc3 c5

(there was still time for 1 1 . ..f5 ! ) 12 f5 ! e5? (an innocent-looking move which loses the game !) 1 3 f6 ! (D). There is no good answer; for example, l 3. .. tZ:lxf6 14 ..\tg5 ! and Black will not survive lbg3-h5 and/or ..\txf6 with lbg3 and WVh5; and l 3. ..gxf6 14 d5 tZ:le7 1 5 ..lth6 tZ:lg7 1 6 tZ:lg3 is al most as bad. This is why f5 is seldom allowed and f6 almost never. You can see the rationale behind the blocking manoeuvre .. .f5.

Getting to work on that c-pawn. Black's plan is simple and White needs to create something in the centre or kingside to counter it.
11 f4 f5
There's the blockading move that we men tioned. Notice how, by preventing f5, Black has prevented White's queen's bishop from moving to the kingside and perhaps joining in an attack. This same idea occurs in the Closed Sicilian line 1 e4 e5 2 tbc3 tbc6 3 g3 g6 4 ..ltg2 ..ltg7, where White plays f4 soon thereafter and Black replies ...f5. Similarly, in the King's Indian At tack, White will often arrange the move f4 and run into ...f5. Black has alternative approach: he can allow White to go one step further and then blockade by 1 1 ...f6 ! ? ( l 1 ...tLla5 1 2 f5 f6 is a similar idea) 1 2 f5 (D). The board is full of tension.

Black has all kinds of options, however ( l 2. .. .l:!.c8 is an obvious one). I wouldn't bet on either side after 1 1 .. .f6. We now return to 1 1 .. .f5 (D ): From the position after l 1 .. .f5, we look at two games:
N!MZO-/NDJAN DEFENCE 133
Yusupov - Karpov Linares 1 993 12 lbg3 (D) At almost every juncture White has tried to exchange pawns, sometimes gaining a small advantage. In this position the exchange seems to help Black's structure as much as White's; e.g., 12 exf5 exf5 13 dxc5 bxc5 14 ..lte3 d6 1 5 .i.f2 WUd7 is a simple example. But the assess ment of these and similar plans can and will change as players refine their move-orders.
12. .•g6
This move took over theory and practice for a while after Karpov won two games versus Yusupov. But 1 2. .. tt:Jd6 is logical, attacking the c4-pawn and defending f5. One possible prob- lem for Black is 1 3 exf5 exf5 ( 1 3. .. tZ:lxf5 14 lbxf5 exf5 1 5 dxc5 bxc5 16 WUf3; 1 3. ..cxd4 ! ?) 14 dxc5 bxc5 1 5 ..lte3, when his loose pieces make the defence difficult. 13 .ite3 (D) Keeping the tension in the centre. Again White can open the position with 1 3 exf5 exf5 14 dxc5 bxc5. Then 1 5 WVa4 is very interesting, and a tactical line that has occurred several times is 1 5 ..lte3 d6 ( 1 5. . .

Black can follow up with moves like ...WVc8 and ....l:!.b8 with a complex position that like so much else may be worked out by the time you read this book! What's important here are not the specific moves and ever-changing theory, but the overall situation: the burden is on White to alter the pawn-structure and/or dy namics of the position before Black consoli dates and wins positionally. This applies to a great number of Nimzo-Indian positions that involve ... .i.xc3+ and bxc3, and is worth keep ing in mind over-the-board. 13 . • . cxd4!?

Variation
1 d4 tZ:lf6 2 c4 e6 3 tt:Jc3 ..ltb4 4 e3
For most of the modem history of the Nimzo lndian Defence, this modest advance has been played more often than any other move. Over the last decade or so 4 WVc2 has become a top level favourite and has recently surpassed 4 e3 on most levels of tournament play, but not by much. Between them these moves dominate Nimzo-Indian practice. In general one can say that 4 e3 is more flexible for both sides, leading to a remarkable number of formations, some times only barely related! I'll stick with a few popular variations whose lessons extend into other lines. We'll look at 4 ...O-O and 4 ...c5, each in their own section. Another important move is 4 ...b6. I'm not devoting space to it, but compare the Queen's Indian Defence of the next chapter. At this point we have some move-order is sues that are seldom addressed although obvi ously known to most masters. It says something about the technical nature of the Nimzo-Indian that tiny differences in move-order have such important positional effects. Because this is all rather confusing, I'm going to make a compari son of the consequences of playing 4 ...O-O and 4 ...c5 in terms of reaching desired positions. Otherwise, whether you're White or Black, it will be easy to get off on the wrong foot. Early Castling 4
••• O-O (D)
Castling is the most popular move at the top levels versus 4 e3. It is nevertheless a committal decision and it's interesting to see which of White's standard set-ups will achieve more or less against a castled king. White has four pri mary options (which are the same ones he plays versus 4 ...c5): 5 a3, 5 ..\td3, 5 tbe2 and 5 tZ:lf3. I'll look at the knight moves as main lines. 5 a3 enters into Siimisch territory, which we've been over. And 5 .itd3 is a transpositional bee hive, as follows: a) Should Black play 5 ... d5, then 6 a3 ! ? ..ltxc3+ 7 bxc3 followed by tbe2 should be compared with the Botvinnik Siimisch. b) Alternatively, 5 ... c5 leads to a number of positions depending upon what White chooses. I should mention that 6 tZ:lf3 d5 7 O-O is one of the classic positions of the Nimzo-Indian. It can

Both 'bl ' and 'b2' are the type of IQP posi tions which we discussed and of which I gave numerous examples in Chapter 3 of Volume 1 . 5 tbe2 (D) Torre - U nzicker Wijk aan Zee 1981 White plays conservatively, hoping to avoid the doubled pawns that would otherwise arise after ... ..ltxc3+. He wants to drive away the bishop and then expand in the centre. The drawbacks to this knight move include hemming in the bishop on fl and developing rather passively. 5 ...d5! Because this counter is available, 4 ...O-O is arguably the best order versus the tbe2 sys tems, or at least the easiest to play. Another strategy to exploit White's slow development and knight placement is 5 ... .l:!.e8 6 a3 .itf8 !?, when a recent game continued 7 d5 d6 8 g3 tbbd7 9 ..ltg2 tbe5 ! 10 b3 exd5 1 1 cxd5 ..ltg4 1 2 f4 tbed7 1 3 WVc2 ..ltxe2 14 @xe2 ! ? c6 1 5 dxc6 bxc6 16 e4 tbc5 1 7 ..lte3 d5 ! 1 8 e5 tbg4 1 9 ..ltd4 f6 20 ..ltxc5 fxe5 ! 2 1 @f3 e4+ 22 @e2 ..ltxc5 23 tbdl ..\tb6 with enormous centre pawns, Av rukh-P.Carlsson, Turin OL 2006.

Castling has cost Black a move in terms of his central re action to White' s strategy and, ironically, it can make his king more exposed by eliminating the option of ... O-O-O. Compare the 'Hilbner Proper' below, which goes 4 ...c5 5 .itd3 lbc6 6 tbf3 ..ltxc3+ 7 bxc3 d6.

This is the best path to take if you want to end up in the Hubner Variation, which is the subject of this section. 5 .itd3 Now 5 tZ'Be2 gives White some aggressive op tions and causes much more trouble for Black than does the position after 4 ...O-O 5 tZ'Be2 d5. The extra complications that come with 4 ... c5 could be a disincentive for Black in practice, but that depends upon specific variations. Here's an overview of 5 tZ'Be2 lines: 5 ... cxd4 (5 ... d5 6 a3 ..ltxc3+ 7 tZ'Bxc3 cxd4 8 exd4 dxc4 9 ..ltxc4 is satisfactory for Black but not to everyone's taste; Black can also play 5 ...b6! ? 6 a3 ..lta5, which has traditionally been a sideline but is considered fully playable) 6 exd4 d5 (6 ...O-O 7 a3 ..lte7 8 d5 exd5 9 cxd5 .l:!.e8 1 0 d6 ..\tf8 has a lot of theory attached to it, with difficulties for both sides, but perhaps a little more for Black if White really knows what he's doing) 7 c5 tZ'Be4 8 .i.d2 tZ'Bxd2 9 WUxd2 (D). 9 ...a5 (9. ..O-O 10 a3 ..lta5 ! ? is also possible)

It just takes some study to catch up with this, especially by White. 5 ... tZ'Bc6 5 ... ..ltxc3+ 6 bxc3 tZ'Bc6, trying to get to a Hubner Variation, is a big positional error be cause White can play 7 tZ'Be2! instead of 7 tZ'Bf3. Then he is a full tempo ahead of a normal Samisch position because he skipped a3. 6 tZ'Bf3 ..ltxc3+ Only now does Black play this way, when White's knight on f3 obstructs its own pawns. 7 bxc3 d6 (D) This is the 'real' Hubner Variation, made fa mous by Hubner himself, but also by Fischer with his positionally devastating win over Spassky in their world championship match. Black has intentionally 'wasted' a move by ex changing on c3 without waiting for White to play a3. The point is that he plans ...e5, a move that wouldn't be particularly attractive if the c-pawns hadn't been doubled; e.g., if White
N!MZO-/NDJAN DEFENCE 139
had WVc2 in before ... ..ltxc3. The irony here is that in the Samisch Variation White is happy to 'waste' the tempo a3 in order to make his ideas work; whereas in the Hubner Variation, Black does the opposite (wastes a move by not wait ing for a3) for much the same reason! What are the general characteristics of the variation? Black is about to play ...e5, so as to partially close the position, and if White plays e4 and d5 (a common set-up) then the position is blocked on at least the queenside and in the centre. Therefore we expect more action on the king's wing. That explains why Black may not rush to castle, as he did above; he may well play . .. O-O-O. White may also choose not to castle, according to taste. On the one hand castling gives White an extra move to see what Black is doing. On the other hand, since the closed cen tre renders White's king safe enough, foregoing O-O can give him an extra tempo to carry out other manoeuvres. At this point the play therefore splits into 8 O-O and lines in which White plays without (or delays) O-O. Lukacs - Stohl Austrian Cht 1994

NIMZO-[NDIAN DEFENCE 143
Classical Nimzo-lndian: 4 'tWc2
1 d4 �f6 2 c4 e6 3 �c3 �b4 4 'i¥'c2 (D)
This is called the Classical Variation of the Nimzo-Indian. One advantage of 4 'i¥'c2 is ob vious right away: it prevents doubled pawns ! That is indeed its most important function. But the queen move also threatens the advance e4, which is of course the dream of every 1 d4 player. Another possibility is that White will develop his dark-squared bishop and clear the back rank for J:ldl or O-O-O. After 4 'iVc2 White's pieces and pawns can end up on a variety of squares, as needed. He can play pawns to f3 and/or e3, a knight to f3, h3 or e2, and a bishop to f4 or g5 . From Black's standpoint there are some en couraging factors that put him on an equal foot ing. The most important one may well be that 4 'iVc2 abandons White's protection of the d pawn. This shows up in quite a few continua tions; for example, 4 ...c5 attacks the d-pawn di- rectly, as does the relatively rare 4 ... �c6. More importantly, when Black plays 4 ... d5, he indi- rectly threatens the d4-pawn, and even should White capture on d5, a queen recapture will still attack that pawn. Since most lines include the move ...c5 and/or . . .�c6 at some point, those moves will gain in effect. Black can also look forward to his usual lead in development that accompanies the Nimzo-Indian, especially if you consider the queen on c2 (or c3) as only "half-developed' , since it is subject to attack by Black's pieces. Generally Black will get castled quickly (in fact 4 ...O-O is one of his main re plies), and variations with an early ... d5 are par ticularly likely to give him extra pieces out. Naturally, White will argue he has control of the centre and two bishops (in many lines), ma jor factors that compensate for Black's devel opment. He'd be right. But whether this leads to more than equality is still an open question. Let's tum to a few of the many possible contin uations that can stem from 4 ...d5 and 4 ...
O-O.
As always I'm being selective. A great deal of theory surrounds the move 4 ...c5, for exam ple, and 4 ... �c6 has a long history behind it. I should note, however, that 4 ...b6? ! lets White occupy the centre by 5 e4 ! in a way that is more favourable than 4 'i¥'c2 O-O 5 e4 below. It can't be recommended. Central Counter-Attack: 4 . . . dS
1 d4 �f6 2 c4 e6 3 �c3 j,b4 4 'i¥'c2 d5 (D)
This is the most direct and one of the two most important replies to 4 'i¥'c2. In many ways it is the most logical. As indicated above, White's queen has abandoned defence of d4, so the threat of ...dxc4 is a serious one. If you think in terms of the Queen's Gambit Declined, it seems aw fully early for White to have his queen on c2. In fact, the first thing that we'll look at can tum into the equivalent of the QGD Exchange Variation, 5 cxd5. That can lead to a quiet game or a com plex tactical game depending upon what the players want. We'll get an overview of the mate rial by looking at instructive games, which as usual are mainly aimed at strategy and less at bringing you up to date with theory.

Great stuff, but involving 50 years in develop ment and countless alternative paths that you may or may not want to master. There are many fascinating opening varia tions whose existence is tactically based in the extreme and require many very specific moves to stay viable at all. It seems to me that when such variations survive a few decades of prac tice and fend off attempts at refutation, they will continue to defy other threats that come up later. That is, at some point we can almost guar antee that the latest 'refutation' will lead to a satisfactory counter, however improbable, that preserves the line from extinction or even disad vantage. Some primary examples are the Dragon and Poisoned Pawn variations of the Sicilian Defence (as well as perhaps the Sveshnikov), and the Marshall Attack of the Ruy Lopez. Others might include the black side of various main lines of the Exchange Griinfeld, the 7 'ij'g4 Winawer French, the Four Pawns Attack main lines versus the Alekhine Defence, and this last Nimzo-lndian line above (beginning with 10 ... 'i¥'a5+ or thereabouts) . In some of these cases (and I'm sure there are more), White may be able to avoid the variation in question and
NIMZO-[NDIAN DEFENCE 145
gain some advantage before the fireworks be gin, but he can't do so in the main lines. This is merely a proposition, and there may prove to be exceptions, but to me it indicates that a funda mental dynamic balance exists in some opening variations that cannot be overcome even by the most ingenious ideas. We now return to the position after 5 cxd5
(D):
This is an odd place to put a diagram as you'd think that it would go after the recapture 5 ... exd5. But there are two absolutely legiti mate moves here:
A: 5 ...
'i¥'xd5 ; B: 5 ...exd5.
A)
5 • • • 'iVxdS (D) Popularized by Romanishin, this has been a major line for at least 1 5 years. 6 �f3 Feeling dissatisfied with this simple knight development, White sometimes turns to 6 e3, preparing 7 j,d2. Black replies 6 ... c5 ! (D ). Black has to break up the centre immediately. This resembles the Chigorin Queen's Gambit line 1 d4 d5 2 c4 �c6 3 cxd5 'i¥'xd5 4 e3 e5 5 �c3 �b4 6 �d2 �xc3 7 �xc3. After 6 ... c5!, the play can continue 7 �d2 �xc3 8 j,xc3 cxd4 9 �xd4 �c6 10 �c3 (or 1 0 j,xf6 gxf6 1 1 �e2 �d7 1 2 a 3 'i¥'e5 with equal ity, Kasparov-Anand, New York PCA Wch (2) 1 995) 10 ... �d7 1 1 �f3 �c8 (D). Again, we have the bishop-pair versus rapid development. In these situations Black has to play actively, because given time the bishop pair will be a decisive force. Here's a model treatment about how to maintain the initiative in a lifeless-looking position: 1 2 a3 �e7 !

'iVfS This move broke onto the scene in the early 1 990s when Romanishin used it successfully. Initially, opinion was largely negative, because it seemed that Black was weakening his pawn structure by allowing 7 'iVxf5, while actually losing time doing so! The nature of the subse quent play has had influence upon chess theory as a whole, in that the resulting pawn-structure now appears in several new opening variations. 7 'iVxfS a) For a while, players were trying the un likely-looking retreat 7 'iVdl ! ?. It doesn' t help White's development, but he would like to gain his time back by e3 and �d3. Black can strike first by 7 ...e5 ! intending 8 �xe5 �e4 or 8 dxe5 �e4 9 �d2 �c6 1 0 e3 �xd2 1 1 'i¥'xd2 �xe5 with roughly equal play. Black's idea is alive and well at the time of writing. b) 7 'iVb3 ! ? ( D) is also slow but keeps the central structure intact and hits b4. We'll follow the game Dreev-Bareev, Elista 1 998: 7 ...�c6 ! ? 8 g3 (White continues his tac tic of controlling key central squares, but again at the loss of time a fianchetto involves; he could also play moves such as 8 �d2, 8 e3 and 8 a3) 8 ...O-O 9 �g2 e5 ! (still attempting to dis turb the equilibrium in quick-hitting style; al though it looks silly, even 9 ... 'iVd5 ! ? is possible) I O d5 ! ? (after IO dxe5 j,e6!

Black' s sustained initiative kept the bish ops in check. 7 ... exf5 (D) At first this may make a strange impression, but when you get used to the many openings in which Black is playing with doubled f-pawns these days it won't surprise you. Black's basic idea is that White's 2:0 central majority is re strained by the c- and f-pawns, so it simply won't be able to expand. In particular a rook on e8 renders the advance e4 on White's part ex tremely unlikely. We aren't looking at many queenless middle games in this book, partly because the opening features can disappear so quickly. In this case it's different: the central pawn-structure often remains the same well into the middlegame, and we get to see the minor pieces' relative worth. Black's strategy is to present a compact centre with reasonably active pieces. White's is to use his space advantage (and, sometimes, the bishop-pair). 8 a3 Now Black has a choice of retreats.

Nevertheless, Black should wait to see how White will make progress. In most cases b5 can be answered by ...c5, or even . . .cxb5. So White needs to use piece-play in stead; e.g., .l:.abl and �b3. In the game, Black tries to compromise White's pawn-structure:

This is Timman-Yusupov, Frankfurt (rapid) 1 998. We have a picture of what's at the heart of ... 'iVf5 : Black has an isolated d-pawn and dou bled f-pawns whereas White has the bishop pair. But both the d-pawn and f5-pawn prevent incursions, and Black will undoubtedly be able to exchange off a bishop. White has seldom

'i¥'xd5 comes close to equality, the positions are a bit difficult to handle. It's also hard to imagine Black winning many games versus relatively strong opposition. That being the case, many players on all levels have used the older recapture with the pawn. This introduces an Exchange Queen's Gambit structure wherein Black's bishop on b4 can be either an advantage or a disadvantage. Indeed, the Queen's Gambit analogy continues after White's next move. 6 �g5 h6 This poses White a stark decision between a purely positional effort (which Black may nevertheless counter actively) and a variation that has produced spectacular tactical strug gles on a regular basis. We' ll look at both ap proaches: The Positional Line 7 �xf6 'i¥'xf6 8 a3 �xc3+ 9 'i¥'xc3 (D) We have a standard Nimzo-Indian trade off: Black is going to castle way before White (maybe next move), but White has pressure down the c-file and the better bishop (his pawns will be on e3 and d4). As usual, White's
B
long-term advantages, which include a minor ity attack, must be countered by Black's activ ity, customarily on the kingside and in the centre. To help with that, Black has a lead in development, at least in terms of being ready to castle and bring pieces out rapidly. On the other hand, he lacks a dark-squared bishop to place on d6 as part of his attack. These factors make the variation instructive and attractive to both sides. It has numerous themes, including those dealing with the minority attack in a pure form. Petrosian - Botvinnik Moscow Wch (1) 1963 9 .. .c6 10 e3 (D) This is the Carlsbad pawn-formation, which pops up in a number of d-pawn openings but es pecially the Queen's Gambit Declined, where it is discussed in detail. By playing ...c6, Black has acceded to the pure form of White's minor ity attack by b4-b5 in order to solidify d5. The solid-looking 1 0 lll f3 ! ? allows Black to place his bishop on f5 where he wants it, without be ing challenged by White (see the next game). On the plus side, lll e5 might follow. 10 ...

But 1 2 b4 would initi ate the queenside attack and ask Black where he's putting his pieces. Finally, 1 2 lll c l !? with the idea of lll d3 (probably prefaced by �e2) has been suggested. It would place the knight optimally at the cost of time and development.

Talk about a fundamental challenge to 4 ... O-O! White simply takes over the centre. This had been condemned for years and designated an error by some sources; then someone decided that it might be OK to suffer a little as long as he could win the battle of control over vitally important central turf. As of this writing 5 e4 has been doing about as well as any other varia tion in the Nimzo-lndian. It is so committal, however, that I wouldn't be shocked if it were 'solved' in the sense of giving Black a clear
NIMZO-/NDIAN DEFENCE 155
path to equality or even better. Whatever hap pens, however, an examination of 5 e4 must be worth it, if only for the average player to under stand why such a natural move hasn't always been one of White's main choices and why it has become one. We' ll first look at 5 ... d6, a re sponse that Black has used to avoid the most critical lines, and then 5 . . .d5, directly challeng ing the centre. For the curious, other moves such as 5 ...c5 seem playable. The Slow Line 5 ...d6 (D) Apparently unchallenging, Black's simple move has its strengths. Much as in other varia tions of the Nimzo-lndian, he wants to block ade the big centre in order to attack it later. 6 a3 a) The logical alternative 6 ..td3 avoids dou bled pawns, but anything that doesn't support d4 allows Black to transform the pawn-structure to his liking: 6 ...e5 ! 7 lbe2 ! ? (7 a3 ! ..txc3+ 8 bxc3 transposes to our main game; 7 d5 allows for a variety of choices, since the c5-square has opened up for Black's bishop on b4 or his knight on b8; e.g., 7 ... lba6 8 a3 ..txc3+ 9 'ifxc3 lbc5 10 f3 lbh5 intending ... °ifh4+ and/or ...f5) 7 ...exd4 8 lbxd4. This position was contested as far back as the 1 930s. Black can continue 8 . . . ..txc3+ 9 'ifxc3 l:.e8 1 0 f3 d5 1 1 cxd5 lbxd5 12 °ifb3 lbb6 with complications. Or he can choose 8 .. . l:.e8 9 O-O ! ? ..txc3 10 'ifxc3 lbxe4 1 1 °ifc2 lbf6 1 2 ..tg5 h6 13 ..th4 with some com pensation. Even 8 ... lbc6 9 lbxc6 bxc6 has been tried with reasonable prospects. One other thing to note is that Black can retreat to c5 with his bishop in all these lines, especially after a3, and have satisfactory play. b) I should mention that 6 e5 ! ? is also played, when White's centre isn't as vulnerable as it looks. 6 ... dxe5 7 dxe5 lbg4 8 lbf3 lbc6 9 i.f4 or 9 a3 can follow, with complex play that I won't pursue here. 6 ... ..txc3+ 7 bxc3 e5 We have a Samisch Variation in which Black has played ...e5, with the important difference that White has played e4 in one jump. On the other hand the move 'ifc2 isn't necessarily that useful, and the advanced centre is potentially ex posed. The resulting strategies can vary wildly. To begin with, Black threatens ... exd4 followed by ... lbxe4, so White's next move is natural: 8 i.d3 (D) Here the main moves are 8 . . . lbc6 and 8 .. .c5, for which I shall give game examples. Black's other continuation is 8 ...b6 9 lbe2 ..tb7 1 0 O-O l:.e8, which attempts to force White into playing d5. This is a traditional way for Black to proceed in the Nimzo-lndian, but White doesn't have to oblige (perhaps having the queen on c2 is worthwhile after all !): 1 1 lbg3 lbc6 1 2 i.b2 lbe7 ! ? 1 3 f4 lbg6 1 4 i.c l ! lbd7 ! ? 1 5 f5 lbgf8 1 6 f6!

Although highly praised, this advance does have the problem that it will inevitably open the c-file and expose White's weaknesses.

11 f3!? This has become a typical Hilbner Variation structure (see that section), but with a knight on e2.

Challenging the Centre 5 ••• dS (D) This starts a direct assault on White's broad centre, leading to a set of critical variations that

have to be assessed on an individual basis. It's surprising that White can allow Black to de velop so quickly with threats; after all, he only has two pieces out and is far from castling. White' s contention is that his central advantage will overcome temporary tactical and develop mental difficulties. There are many paths to consider here; I won't begin to try to cover all the complexities of 5 ... d5, but will follow what currently seems to be the main line: 6 es tt:Je4 7 a3 7 ..td3 c5 8 a3 ..txc3+ 9 bxc3 transposes but is less forcing. 7 ... ..txc3+ 8 bxc3 cS 9 ..td3 (

160 MASTERING THE CHESS OPENINGS
7 .....tb7 (D) There is a considerable body of theory and practice behind the move 7 ... ..ta6, although it is still not considered as important as the simple fianchetto. In grandmaster games in which 4 'ifc2 is played, this position is reached more often than any other. For the most part the variations turn technical, however, which dampens the interest of many lower-level players. I'll give a couple of games to indicate what both sides may be after. 8 f3 Kasparov - Timman Linares 1993 There's a logic to this move that goes beyond enforcing e4, namely, that control of the square itself lies behind most of White's strategies in this variation. For example, apart from 8 f3, White sometimes plays 8 lbf3 and then 9 lbd2, as in the next game. Or, in other lines, a knight will come to c3 via e2. White does have one other idea that is specifically connected with 8 f3 : his knight can develop to h3 and then per haps f2. But this highlights a negative aspect to White's whole approach: he is still a long way from developing his kingside. 8 ... dS!? (D) Black employs the easiest idea, which is to challenge White's centre before it becomes mo bile. But 8 ...h6! is helpful in several lines, since after 9 ..th4 it takes the bishop away from the queenside and centre, in particular e3. There's also a tactical point to forcing the bishop back, as seen in the note to move 1 0.
9 e3 lbbd7
These last two moves have become so cus tomary that (ignoring the omission of ...h6 for the moment) the majority of games with a ...d5 defence begin here. 10 cxdS! exdS A tactic that often applies in these positions is 1 0. .. lbxd5?! 1 1 ..txd8 lbxc3 1 2 ..txc7 lbd5 1 3 ..tf4 lbxf4 1 4 exf4. White's pawns are crip pled, but he's still a pawn ahead and this posi tion has lacked takers from Black's side . ..td3 and lbe2 will follow in most lines, with @f2 a good centralizing move. However, it's important to note that if the moves 8 ...h6 9 ..th4 were inserted, as they usu ally are, then in this line Black could answer ..tf4 with ... g5 ! and win the e3-pawn. That position is known to be equal. In fact, White hasn't been able to prove any advantage in the lines after 8 ...h6 9 ..th4 d5, although the debate continues. 11 ..td3 (D)

Targeting the e-pawn right away. Now it looks as though ...h6 is a threat. 12 lbe2! h6 13 ..th4! In fact, we've transposed to a normal posi tion except that Black didn't have the opportu nity for an effective ... lbxd5. 13 .. •c5 The point is that 13 ... l::!. xe3? loses to 14 ..txf6! lbxf6 15 ..th7+.
14 O-O l:.c8 15 �d2 �e7 16 ..tf2 ..tc6
An important positional idea is that 16 ...cxd4 is well answered by 1 7 exd4! (D), even though 17 lbxd4 places a knight in front of the isolani opposing the bad bishop. That latter position isn't bad, but it does give Black nice posts on e5 and c5 for his d7-knight. After the recapture by the pawn, we have a position that could come from the Queen's Gambit. Every key central square is covered and White, whose position looks innocuous at the moment, can slowly activate his pieces, in particular a rook to the e-file and his bishop to g3. Again, stability favours the bishop-pair. 17 lbc3! lbf8 18 l:.fel lbe6 19 ..th4 lbg5

6 Queen's Indian Defence
Introduction to 3 �f3
1 d4 '2lf6 2 c4 e6 3 ctJf3 (D)
By playing 3 '2lf3 White enters into a contest about move-order choices. By omitting or put ting off '2lc3 he avoids the highly-respected Nimzo-Indian Defence ( 1 d4 '2lf6 2 c4 e6 3 '2lc3 .lfi.b4) and indeed, this is generally consid ered the main motivation behind 3 '2lf3. Other wise, with a few exceptions mentioned below, White gains little by delaying 3 '2lc3 versus the main defences to 1 d4, and he can sacrifice some popular options. Let me clarify that by examples. After 3 '2lc3, White might want to enter into a variation not accessible after 3 ctJf3, such as the Exchange Queen's Gambit 3 ... d5 4 cxd5 exd5 5 ii.gs c6 6 e3 .lfi.e7 7 .lfi.d3 O-O 8 '2lge2. White's commitment to '2lf3 precludes a number of popular options. In fact, even the Classical Queen's Gambit Declined that arises from 1 d4 '2lf6 2 c4 e6 3 ctJf3 d5 4 '2lc3 differs in several ways from 1 d4 d5 2 c4 e6 3 '2lc3, al though they will often transpose. In the latter order, for example, Black might play 3 ... .lfi.e7. These positions are dealt with at some length in Chapter 2 on the Queen's Gambit. Another restriction imposed by 3 '2lf3 comes up in the Modem Benoni. White has eliminated certain options that arise after 3 '2lc3 c5 4 d5 exd5 5 cxd5 d6 6 e4 g6; for example, 7 .lfi.d3 .lii. g7 8 '2lge2 O-O 9 O-O, 7 f4 i..g7 8 i..b5+ (or here 8 ctJf3) or 7 f3 .lfi.g7 8 i..g5. Obviously, none of those variations can be played after 3 ctJf3 . Thus, when playing 3 ctJf3, it's necessary to build a repertoire around these limitations. In actual practice, most players are not deterred by that task. 3 ...b6 (D) The Queen's Indian Defence (a.k.a. 'QID') is defined by this move. Notice that after 3 '2lc3, 3 ...b6?! allows 4 e4 with superior central control, something Black really doesn't want to let happen. After 3 '2lf3 b6, however, Black in tends to keep a determined hold on the central light squares and permit neither a successful e4 nor d5 . This can involve the moves ...d5 or . .. f5, if necessary, and often includes occupation of e4 by either a knight or a bishop. White for his part may strive directly to en force e4 by moves such as '2lc3 (perhaps pref aced by a3 to prevent ... .lfi.b4) and 'iVc2. Or he can do the same, but slowly, by means of g3, .lii. g2 and ctJc3 or '2lbd2 depending upon the sit uation. His ultimate set-up and strategy will de pend upon what Black specifically undertakes in the centre. The resulting tension can produce
QUEEN'S INDIAN DEFENCE 165
both strategically and tactically interesting chess. This is a lesson to players everywhere, because for many years the Queen's Indian De fence had the reputation of being a dull opening that normally led to a drawish position. In fact, that reputation still holds among some lower rated players, although it shouldn't. I'm going present an overview of the varia tions and ideas of the Queen's Indian, with a mix of older and newer games. The emphasis will be on a few of the typically dynamic ideas that are being played in modem chess. To this end the material divides into two sections: the Fianchetto Variation (4 g3), and the Petrosian System (4 a3). Fianchetto Variation
1 d4 '2lf6 2 c4 e6 3 '2lf3 b6 4 g3
Historically this has been White's main choice and it remains so in spite of the emer gence of new strategies. Straight away, White's fianchettoed bishop anticipates opposing its counterpart on b7 and indirectly looks at the same key e4- and d5-squares as his opponent does. White also clears the way for early cas tling. A quick look at obvious alternatives might clarify White's choice: a) White can play 4 '2lc3 but then after 4 ... .lfi.b4 we're back in a kind of Nimzo-Indian, which may not be the type of position most players are looking for when they play 3 ctJf3 instead of 3 '2lc3. b) 4 '2lbd2 takes the sting out 4 ....lfi.b4, a move which would no longer threaten to double White's pawns as it would after 3 '2lc3. But this comes at the cost of blocking the c I -bishop and reducing the white queen's influence over d4. Most importantly, White chance of ever play ing d5 is greatly reduced. Black can continue simply by 4 .. . .lfi.b7 with . . .d5 or ... .lfi.e7 and . ..O-O next. c) 4 .lfi.f4 is a perfectly good move, in order to get the bishop out before hemming it in by e3. A typical sequence would be 4 .. . .lfi.b7 5 e3 (5 '2lc3 .lfi.b4 is a type of Nimzo-Indian, easy to play for Black because White's f4-bishop nei ther hampers Black's knight on f6 nor defends the queenside; thus, for example, 6 e3 '2le4 7 �c2 f5 8 .lfi.d3 O-O 9 O-O .lfi.xc3 10 bxc3 d6 1 1 d5 '2lc5 12 dxe6 .lfi.xf3 1 3 gxf3 ctJxd3 14 �xd3 '2lc6 with good play) 5 . . . .lfi.e7 (5 ... .lfi.b4+ is a well-known option) 6 h3 (versus . . . '2lh5, which would track down and exchange the bishop on f4 and leave Black with the two bishops) 6 ...O-O 7 '2lc3 d5 (D). Here White's move h3 (as opposed to devel oping) leads to a balanced version of a Queen· s Gambit. An intriguing gambit goes 8 cxd5 (8 .lfi.e2 c5) 8 ... '2lxd5 (8 .. . exd5 is also reasonable. with ideas of ...c5 and ... '2le4) 9 '2lxd5 �xd5 ! 10 .lfi.xc7?!, and now 10 ...�a5+! ( I O. . . .lfi.b4+ is the normal move) 1 1 ctJd2 ctJd7 intending ... l:tac8 and ...e5 with more than enough play for a pawn. d) 4 e3 is a solid, risk-free move that pre pares .lfi.d3 and O-O. I won't be covering the de tails here. White might want to look into this modest line to avoid main-line theory. and Black should be ready to respond to it. Proba bly 4 ... .lfi.b7 5 .lfi.d3 d5 6 O-O .lfi.e7 or 6 ... .lfi.d6 is the easiest way to approach the position. We now return to 4 g3 (D):

166 N!ASTERING THE CHESS OPENINGS
After 4 g3, Black makes a decision as to how he wants to counter White's space advantage: 4 ... .lfi.b7 or 4 ... .lfi.a6. The Classical 4 . . . .tb7 4 ... .lfi.b7 This is the older move, which generally leads to a quieter game but not always so. 5 i.g2 White's plan is O-O, Cl'Bc3, and then d5 or 'iVc2 and e4. 5 ... i.e7 (D) Where do the pieces belong? Basically Black has to develop his kingside, get castled, and make sure that White doesn't play d5. His other natural choice is 5 ... .lfi.b4+, when 6 .lfi.d2 i..xd2+ (6 .. . .lfi.e7 ! ?) 7 'iVxd2 Cl'Be4 8 'iYc2 O-O 9 Cl'Bc3 sets up an old trap: 9 ... 'l'Bxc3? 10 'l'Bg5 ! and Black is losing material ! This is a typical tactic that is worth knowing, although Black had to make some weak moves to allow it.
6 O-O
6 'l'Bc3 will transpose to our main line after 6 ... Cl'Be4 7 .lfi.d2 i.f6 8 O-O O-O. A famous game Korchnoi-Karpov, Moscow Ct (21 ) 1974 went 6 ...O-O 7 'iVc2 c5 8 d5 ! ? (D). This is a standard break that both sides always have to be aware of. White's idea is to shut the b7-bishop out of play. He will play e4 next, so Black has to capture, when tactics erupt: 8 ...exd5
9 Cl'Bg5 (now the d-pawn is pinned) 9 ...'l'Bc6 (best
was 9 ...h6! 10 'l'Bxd5 .lfi.xd5 1 1 i.xd5 Cl'Bc6) 10 Cl'Bxd5 g6 1 1 'iVd2 ! 'l'Bxd5 12 .lfi.xd5 l:tb8? 13 0:Jxh7 ! l:te8 (the main line goes 1 3. ..

O-O 7 'l'Bc3 'l'Be4 Otherwise White will prevent this by 'iVc2. 8 .lfi.d2! A very instructive move. If White plays 8 d5 instead, then 8 .. . 'l'Bxc3 cripples his pawns. So 8 i.d2 is logical, preparing 9 d5. But the interest ing part is that if Black captures White's bishop on d2, White counts upon having a big centre and better development that will outweigh the bishop-pair. That is a bit unusual when there are no weaknesses in Black's camp, but it has been shown to be true in this particular position. Thus you will very seldom see 8 ... 'l'Bxd2. 8 ... .lfi.f6 The other well-known move is 8 ... f5, when 9 'iVc2 .lfi.f6 10 l:tadl ! has won some nice games. 9 l:tcl (D) This is the basic position of the main line. Let's see how a World Champion handles it:

Black plays an 'extended fianchetto' , the modem favourite. although it dates all the way back to Nimzowitsch himself. I'll mainly give illustrative examples without many detailed an alytical notes. 5 b3 The attack on the c-pawn proves annoying, and 5 'iVa4 has generally been ineffective (one good line is 5 ... �b7 6 i..g2 c5), as has 5 'iVb3, so 'everybody' plays 5 b3. 5 ... i..b4+ This check is designed to disrupt the coordi nation of White's pieces. 5 ... i..b7 is rarer but playable.

His next plan is to enforce ...d5, which will both give him space and attack c4 . 7 .i.g2 c6 Wojtaszek - Macieja Krakow 2006 This move may look strange, but Black wants to be able to play ...d5 and have the option of re capturing with the c-pawn should White play cxd5.

The theory of the variation with 4 g3 i.a6 5 b3 i.b4+ is ever-expanding. We may soon find out if Black can effectively neutralize White's play in this manner or will have to suffer under a long-term disadvantage. Whether the Queen's Indian supplies a satisfactory defence to 3 lllf3 depends in part upon his solution to 4 g3. Petrosian System (4 a3)
1 d4 lll
f6 2 c4 e6 3 lll f3 b6 4 a3 (D)
B
At first you may think that this move is a ter rible waste of time. Obviously, White is trying to prevent ...i.b4, but is it worth a tempo? And what else does 4 a3 do? To begin with, prevent ing ... i.b4 is worth a lot more than it may seem. It's not just that the Nimzo-Indian (3 lll c3 i.b4) is such a bother to play against, but that Black has already committed himself to ...b6 (and thus ... i.b7 or ... i.a6). That is a set-up in which a knight on c3 is particularly useful. Specifically, a knight there not only supports e4 (as does a knight on d2 or queen on c2), but also the pawn advance d5 (a move that loses its support after llld2 or i¥c2). This is important because once Black has fianchettoed his queen's bishop, a white pawn on d5 can become particularly irri tating. In response to this potential threat, Black can of course play ...d5, but that accedes to a type of pawn-structure that Black may not pre fer once committed to ...b6. To understand this. let' s compare that formation with the Queen's Gambit Declined. The only major variation in which Black plays ...b6 is the Tartakower. In deed, if play from the diagram proceeded 4 ...d5 5 lll c3 i.e7 6 i.g5 O-O 7 e3 i.b7 (7 ...h6 is a po tential waste of tempo: 8 i.xf6!), Black would have a standard position of the Tartakower Vari ation in which the move a3 can justifiably be re garded as useless, or nearly so. But once Black has weakened his queenside squares, White has other options; e.g., 6 cxd5 ! exd5 (6 ... lll xd5 7 e4) 7 i.f4 O-O 8 e3 (D).
B
White has serious queenside pressure be cause of Black's weaknesses there (l:i.c 1 and ei ther i¥h3 or i¥a4 might prove useful). In fact, the move lll b5 becomes an immediate theme (e.g .. 8 ... i.f5 9 lll b5 llla6 10 i¥a4), because White's profligate 4 a3 actually prevents ... i.b4+ in re sponse ! 4 ••. i.b7 We'll follow this as the main line but it's quite possible that other moves are as good or better: a) 4 ... i.a6 is very popular. Black has done well in this line, and he retains a degree of flexi bility in his choice of piece placements. The main line goes 5 i¥c2 i.b7 ! (this is a hyper modem idea: first Black diverts the queen and
1 74 MASTERING THE CHESS OPENINGS
then wastes a move to cover e4; but what's the point?) 6 lbc3 c5 ! (the queen no longer sup ports the move d5, so Black can break up the centre in this way) 7 e4! (taking over the largest share of the centre; 7 dxc5 would concede d4) 7 ... cxd4 8 lbxd4 (D). As in the Sicilian Defence, Black has a central majority and would love to achieve ...d5. For the moment, that move fails to cxd5 and i.b5+, so White has some time to strengthen his cen tre. The queen on c2 can either be a drawback (it sits on the open c-file) or an advantage (it al lows White's rooks to connect more quickly). Here Black has played 8 ... lbc6 and 8 ...d6 with reasonable success. A complicated alternative is 8 ... i.c5 9 lbb3 lbc6! (not only does Black de velop quickly but he also targets the only weak ness in White's position: the hole on d4) 10 i.g5 h6 1 1 i.h4 lbd4! 12 lbxd4 i.xd4 13 i.d3 (the white e-pawn needs protection) 13 ...

15 O-O-O O-O 16 'lt>bl d6 1 7 i.xe5 dxe5 (D).
There's that doubled e-pawn structure that we talk about periodically through the book. Whether the pawns are ultimately useful or a problem is as yet unclear, but notice that both d5 and d4 are covered so that White can't put a piece on either square, and of course d4 will serve as an outpost for Black's pieces. On the other hand, White has no targets for Black to attack and he has a potentially important queen side pawn-majority. Khenkin-Adams, Bundes liga 2002/3 continued 1 8 i¥e2 l:i.d8 19 i¥e3 (White could consider some kingside attack with, say, 19 g4 or 19 f3 and g4 next) 19. .. l:i.d4!

Now White's most ambitious move is 5 d5. Then: bl) It's instructive to see why 5 ...exd5 6 cxd5 d6 (6 ... g6 !?) 7 lbc3 g6?! isn't supposed to be good: 8 e4 i.g7 9 i.b5+ ! i.d7 1 0 i.e2 (or I 0 i.d3) 10. ..O-O I I O-O (D). Note that we've arrived at a Benoni in which Black has two extra moves ...b6 and ... i.d7 for White's one. Nevertheless, this trade-off fa vours White, who can handily play moves such as .ltf4 with tempo. Conversely, Black's plans are disrupted because he would like to play ei ther ... lba6-c7 (not possible here) or ...l:i.e8 and ... lbbd7, in which case he needs to move the d7- bishop. That points to the move l l ... i.g4, when 12 i.f4 i.xf3 13 i.xf3 i¥e7?! prepares ... lbbd7, a familiar plan from the Modem Benoni of
Q UEEN'S INDIAN DEFENCE 1 75
Chapter 9. Unfortunately, White can then play
14 e5 ! and, because of the insertion of ...b6, the
'normal' 14 ... dxeS loses to 1 5 d6. The situation is more complicated than this (as always) but those are basic indications of why Black will probably want to avoid this version of a Benoni set-up. b2) 5 ... i.a6 ! (D) and now: This leads to a better Benoni-type position. Play generally proceeds along the lines of 6 Vic2 exd5 7 cxd5 g6 (7 ... lbxd5?? 8 'iVe4+) 8 lbc3 i.g7 9 g3 O-O 10 i.g2 d6 1 1 O-O l:i.e8 1 2 l:i.e l lbbd7 ( 1 2. . .b5 ! ?) 1 3 �f4 Vie7. We've ar rived at a Fianchetto Benoni in which Black has achieved a theoretically ideal set-up, in that e5 is under control and his pieces are well-placed for action; e.g., ... lbg4-e5 is a good reorganization. However, there's still a ques tion of the specific effects of Black's extra moves ...b6 and ... i.a6. White can try to ex ploit the queenside vulnerability immediately by 14 'iVa4 ilb7 15 lbb5, when we see how positional factors in chess suddenly devolve into tactics. Pelletier-Gelfand, Biel 2001 con tinued 1 5 . .. lbeS ! ? 16 lbxe5 dxe5 1 7 d6 ! 'iVd7 1 8 i.xb7 Vixb7 19 i.g5 with some advantage.

Let's return to the main move, 4 ... �b7 ( D ): S lbc3 dS Of Black's other moves, only 5 ... g6 !? merits a look. The underlying idea is that if White presses forward with his plan of 6 d5, in order to block out Black's bishop on b7, Black has another strong bishop on g7 along the open al h8 diagonal. In turn, White has other answers to 5 ...g6; for example, developing quickly by means of 6 i.g5 i.g7 7 Vic2 (intending moves such as l:i.dl and e4), or 6 'iVc2 (intending e4). In both cases, the critical reply is ... i.xf3. White's bishop-pair should more than make up for his pawn-structure. This is especially so since Black has made no fewer than three moves with his bishop to remove the f3-knight ( ...b6. ...i.b7 and ...i.xf3) and that leaves him behind in development. After 6 Vic2 i.xf3, White has recaptured the bishop in both ways, the safe course being 7 gxf3 (doubled f-pawns have ad vantages that we discuss from time to time in this book) 7 ... lbc6 (7 ... i.g7 8 i.g5 gets White's bishop in front of his central pawns once e3 is played) 8 e3 i.g7 9 f4 followed by i.g2 and O-O. White's f-pawn helps to restrain ...e5. 6 cxd5 White has several other moves here, but I"ll only mention 6 �g5, when the most popular

line is 6 ... il..e7 7 Via4+!? c6 (7 ... i¥d7 chal lenges White to enter an apparently equal end game; for example, 8 i¥xd7+ lllbxd7 !? 9 lbb5 il..d8 10 cxd5 lbxd5 1 1 e4 lll5f6; so 8 Vic2 !? is often played) 8 il..xf6 il..xf6 9 cxd5 exd5 10 e3 O-O 1 1 il..e2 (D).

At least 4 a3 comes in handy here in order to prepare b4. More challenging is 10 g3 O-O 1 1 il..g2, putting pressure on d5; com pare the next note.
6. ..
lll xdS An instructive decision. 6 ... lllxd5 is easily Black's most popular choice, leaving the bishop's path unobstructed on the long diagonal. But 6 ... exd5 has also been played a fair amount. In that case we again have a typical Queen's Gam bit. White has the mediocre move a3 in, but Black has played ...b6 and ... il..b7 rather early on. Instead of transposing to a kind of Tarta kower, which is perfectly playable, White will sometimes put his bishop on g2, as in the last note. Then out of many possibilities a classic trade-off may occur: 7 g3 il..e7 8 i¥a4+ c6 (8 ... i¥d7 9 i¥xd7+ can be followed by moves like lllb5, �f4 and �h3) 9 �g2 O-O 10 O-O lll bd7 1 1 �f4 lllh5 1 2 l:i.adl ! lllxf4 13 gxf4
(D).
What are the characteristics of this position? Black has the bishop-pair and White's f-pawns are doubled. Nevertheless, White light-squared bishop is better than its counterpart on b7, he has the g-file, and a well-timed knight jump to e5 can be useful. Black can try to gain space on the queenside ( ...b5 and ...a5 or ... lbb6, for ex ample) or use piece-play on the kingside ( ... l:i.e8, ... lllf8-g6). In the meantime, White might shift his pieces to the kingside ('lt>h l , l:i.gl , i¥c2, e3, lbe2-g3), especially since any attempt to play b4 can be weakening. But 6 ... lbxd5 (D) is the most important con tinuation: Apart from the main lines with 4 g3, this is probably the most heavily analysed position from the Queen's Indian Defence. By 'surren dering the centre' but keeping the long diagonal open for his bishop, Black announces his policy of allowing White to form a strong centre and then sniping at it from the wings. The resulting positions resemble the Griinfeld Defence in spirit. Black's bishop will usually be on e7 in stead of g7, but Black's quest for the queenside light squares gives the two openings a similar flavour.
Q UEEN'S IND/AN DEFENCE
1 77 At this juncture White normally plays: A: 7 e3 or B: 7 i¥c2. We' ll look at games that express typical ideas behind both moves, by no means attempt ing to recreate the current theoretical standing of the variation. A complex alternative is 7 i.d2, which intends a recapture with the bishop after ... lllxc3; this idea normally appears after 7 i¥c2. There are also a number of variations with 7 i¥a4+ and/or �g5 that haven't produced spectacular results, probably because the move a3 isn't so useful in that case.

7 e3 (D)
This is a somewhat older line that can trans pose to the more modem 7 �c2 with small but significant differences.

Notice that the pawn-structure is the same for mation that we've seen in so many openings, famously the Exchange Variation of the Queen's Gambit Declined. The exchange of a pair of pieces may favour White under those circum stances. In fact, Black's best idea may consist of foregoing ... i.g7 to point his dark-squared bishop towards the kingside, perhaps from d6. From there it also covers Black's queenside dark squares. 9 i.d2!?

The basics are easy to understand: White wants to protect his centre and then shift towards the kingside or, some times, simply push the d-pawn down the board. Black tries to counterattack on the queenside, usually via the c-file. Eliminating the light squared bishops goes a long way towards pro tecting his king. We'll look at two games from this position.

7 King's Indian Defence
Before we even begin, I should explain that the King's Indian Defence (a.k.a. 'KID') is actu ally a set of moves that has no specific starting point. That is to say, Black plays 1 . . .tll f6, 2 ... g6, 3 ... .lll. g7, ...d6 and almost always ... O-O (nor mally in that order), versus almost any first move by White other than l e4. But we shall concern ourselves with the King's Indian De fence in its original meaning, that is, versus d4. The best way to introduce ourselves to the KID is to take a stroll through the first few moves. 1 d4
1 c4 lll
f6 can transpose into a 1 d4 version of the King's Indian Defence should White play d4 on any of the next several moves. The same applies to 1 lll f3; for example, 1 .. .tll f6 2 d4 g6, etc.
1...tllf6 (D)
2 c4 2 lll f3 g6 is another route that often trans poses to c4 lines. Of course that order might lead to independent systems; for example, 3 .Ill. gs, 3 .lli. f4, and a number of lesser options that are not covered in this book. A very brief word on the first two, since I'll have a bishop-devel opment theme over the next few moves. a) 3 .Ill. gs is an offshoot of the Torre Attack. Black can play any number of systems and any number of move-orders, but in deference to my lectures about ...cS in these contexts, I'll point out that after 3 ... .lll. g7 4 tll bd2 (versus . . . lbe4 ) 4 ...c S i s a legitimate choice, with one important line proceeding S .lll. xf6 .lll. xf6 6 lll e4 �xd4 (or 6 ...

Again ...cS is to be consid- ered at most points; e.g., 3 ...cS is theoretically equal and 3 ... .lll. g7 4 e3 d6 S h3 (to have a place to hide after ... tllhS) S ...O-O 6 .lll. e2 cS can be played, among others.

This is relevant to points that I make below. 2 ... g6 3 lll c3 This time 3 lll f3 .lll. g7 4 g3 can be of inde pendent significance and will generally trans pose to the Fianchetto System, which I shall not be covering in this book. 3 ... .lll. g7 (D) This position may be considered the begin ning point for the King's Indian Defence. a sto ried opening associated with dynamic slugfests of the highest order. It was championed by
184 MASTERING THE CHESS OPENINGS
Fischer and Kasparov, who helped to keep the King's Indian popular in spite of its reputation as a risky proposition for the defender. Kaspar ov in particular revolutionized the strategic and even philosophical elements of the opening. The theory of the King's Indian has undergone constant changes for 60 years including wild shifts of strategy and assessment. Flexible play and the possibility of both players working on either or both wings makes this an opening for those with an inclination towards complex stra tegic thinking. At the same time, attacking play ers can get addicted to it! Today the King's In dian is enjoying a comeback among leading masters after a temporary decline in usage; at the club and open tournament level it has never stopped being popular. To speak briefly about some general charac teristics of the King's Indian, let me take the main-line position following 1 d4 lll f6 2 c4 g6 3 tllc3 �g7 4 e4 d6 5 lll f3 O-O (D). It's no wonder that players of the 1 9th cen tury and first half of the 20th century took rela tively little interest in this opening. After all, Black has failed to move a pawn to the fourth rank within the first five moves! No respectable opening at the time had such consistent disre gard for classical principles, particularly when Black doesn't even have a grip on any of the four central squares. It wasn't until the late 1940s and 1950s that creative minds from the Soviet Union, including Bronstein, Boleslav sky, Geller, and a host of other strong players and analysts, began to find merit in Black's set up. The virtues of White's position are fairly obvious and have served him well up to the present day: space, central control, a broad and mobile centre, and convenient squares for his pieces. But what sustains Black's game? His de velopment has been faster than White's, which is a start. More significant than any other factor, however, is the relative weakness of White' s d4, a consideration neglected i n much o ft he lit erature. The d4-square will never be protected by a pawn and is always a potential point of at tack or outpost for Black's pieces. In some varia tions we see ...c5 and ... tllc6 targeting that point, but most of the variations in the position above involve the move ... e5. Even then, only a minor ity of systems combine ...e5 with the direct as sault by ... tllc6 and ... �g4 in combination with the bishop on g7. Instead, the move ...e5 sets up a simple dynamic. Three things can happen: a) White can capture on e5 by dxe5, but this reduces the vitality of White's centre and ex poses d4 to occupation in conjunction with the d-file. See the Exchange Variation below and similar positions in the main lines. b) Black can capture on d4 by ...exd4 with unpredictable effects. But what attracts King's Indian adherents about that trade is the exten sion of the range of the powerful bishop on g7 and the opening of the e-file for a rook. More over, Black often gains the handy squares c5 and e5 for his knights. In return, White has an ideal restriction of Black's 'surrendered' centre (the pawn on d6 can't advance), which means that Black has to operate within a limited re gion. Furthermore, White's pieces can take up active squares in a harmonious manner; for ex ample, a knight on d4 and bishop on e3. c) White can advance his pawn to d5. This generally eliminates any designs that Black has on the d4-square and extends White's space ad vantage. But now we can begin to see why the King's Indian is viable. With d5 relieving pres sure on Black's centre and rendering any direct attacks unlikely, both sides can expand along the pawn-chains on opposite wings. For White, the move c5 leads to the opening of lines and pressure on Black's pawns on c7 and d6. For Black the move . . .f5, and in the main lines . . .f4 and ...g5-g4, leads to the opening of lines and pressure on White's kingside. That is at least a reasonable bargain for Black, whose bishop on g7 is a threat to become free should White try to stop his ...f5-f4 advance by exf5 or by f4.
KING 'S IND/AN DEFENCE 185
That's quite a superficial account of play in the King's Indian, and such positions don't even arise in many variations. But the 'threat' of their occurrence underlies a lot of what both sides actually do in terms of strategy. The other positional factors that interact with this opening are too numerous to mention, so I'll leave that to analysis and examples in specific variations. My emphasis will be on the major systems that begin 1 d4 tt'Bf6 2 c4 g6 3 tt'Bc3 i.g7 4 e4 d6. They constitute the large bulk of master prac tice, and along with g3 systems they account for well over 90% of grandmaster games. Be cause the main lines are so instructive, I'll only briefly examine some instructive alternatives in what follows. Selected Alternatives to 4 e4
1 d4 tt'Bf6 2 c4 g6 3 tt'Bc3 i.g7 (D)
There are of course many alternatives to 4 e4, but none of them except the g3 variations are very popular. Therefore I'll point out only a few options with ideas that you might want to be aware of. I'll try to tie this section together a bit by emphasizing the move i.g5 in many con texts. 4 tt'Bf3 This flexible development of the king's knight introduces most serious deviation from main lines. Almost any set-up following from 4 e3 can be met by ...d6, ... O-O and ...e5 (sup ported by a piece if necessary). 4 i.f4 is a legiti mate move and will usually transpose into some other variation after 4 ...d.6. Both sides should be aware that Black's attempts to exchange such a bishop by means of ... tt'Bh5 (for example ) are an important consideration. Compare lines below. Our main theme is the development of the queen's bishop to g5 at various stages. Here 4 i.g5 can be met by 4 ...c5 (4 ...h6 5 .lth4 d6 is normal and fine, of course; ...c5 may follow soon anyway), and if 5 d5, 5 ...h6 6 i.h4 'ika5 7 °iVd2 g5 8 i.g3 tt'Bh5 (D) followed ... tt'Bxg3 with equality. What should be noted is that, unsupported by a knight on f3, the move 9 i.e5 cannot be played. That is the move that White should look for if Black has not yet played ...d6 (see the next note). In this kind of position, which is ubiquitous in the King's Indian and Benoni, hundreds of top-level games have confirmed that Black's two bishops at least compensate for his slightly weakened pawn-structure. Regarding the latter. we can apply the old saying: weaknesses aren't weak unless you can exploit them. 4 ...d6 Once White is committed to 4 tt'Bf3, castling by Black seems to have lost the disadvantages that it has in the order 4 e4 O-O. That doesn't mean that it's a better move than 4 ...d6, but it al lows Black a few new options; for example. 4 ...O-O 5 i.g5 c5 (the move ...c5 is thematic if the c I -bishop strays to the kingside; see below )

186 MASTERING THE CHESS OPENINGS
This is known as the Smyslov System, which is very solid and a good choice for White if he doesn't fancy too complicated a position. He opts for quick development and well-placed pieces without trying to capture too much of the centre. For his part, Black doesn't feel very threatened and can play to gain some space on either wing. He also hopes to chase down White's dark-squared bishop as above. As for 5 .lli. f4, Farago-Bilek, Budapest 1965 saw a creative solution to 5 ... O-O 6 h3, a rather irritating move which is frequently played to preserve the f4-bishop and avoid having it chased down as in the examples that we keep seeing.

KING 'S IND/AN DEFENCE 187
for his own pieces. The conflict between this wish and the vulnerability of his centre to Black's attacks underlies the players' strategies for most of the opening phase and sometimes well beyond.
4. ..d6 (D)
This is almost universally played after 4 e4. Black's intent is to restrain eS and stake out some claim to the centre. I shall only remark upon 4 ... O-O in the introductory note to the Four Pawns Attack below, in the context of that vari ation. Although I won't entirely neglect other vari ations, I shall devote most of this chapter to the Four Pawns Attack (S f4), and the Classical Variation (S lllf3), with an emphasis on the lat ter. The King's Indian is so vast that one could devote this book to its many fascinating varia tions, but in line with the philosophy that un derstanding can only be gained by attending to details, I have decided to specialize in those two variations. The examination of the Four Pawns continues my policy of taking the most obvious attempt at refutation of an opening in order to gain some insight into its character. To do this we might ask which moves would probably be proposed by the average player if he were see ing an opening for the first time, especially if he'd heard that the opening wasn't supposed to be any good. That is, which variation would he instinctively use to demonstrate that the open ing was disadvantageous? For the King's In dian Defence, the Four Pawns Variation seems the obvious choice in that respect, because it at tempts to punish Black immediately for not oc cupying the centre. The Classical Variation of the King's Indian Defence is one of the most subtle and complex variations in chess, but at the same time it has some broadly applicable ideas that are quite straightforward, especially about pawn-struc tures and their treatment. Thus the inexperi enced player can gain insights that will help him begin to play the KID, and there will be material that should help players of any level to refine their understanding. In addition to these two systems, I have in cluded sections on the Averbakh Variation (S .lll. e2 O-O 6 .lll. gS) and the Samisch Variation (S f3). They feature a few unique pawn-structures and in particular emphasize the formations with the move ...cS that don't appear in the Classical Variation. First, to complete the discussion that we've had about .Ill. gs lines, I'll focus on the move S .Ill. gs and tie it in with the earlier examples we looked at, both practically and philosophically. After S .lll. gS, Black can castle, but one might ar gue that S ...O-O isn't optimal because it justifies White's play after 6 \Rd2, preventing ...h6 and preparing attack in many lines. Of course that's hardly disastrous, but S .. .h6 is the more ambi tious choice: 6 .lll. h4 (if instead 6 i.e3, 6 ... tll g4 is a good response, and 6 .lli. f4 can be met effi ciently by 6 ... tllc6 7 dS eS !); and now 6 ... cS !
(D).
We've now seen this move several times; in the King's Indian and most 1 d4 openings, an early move of White's queen's bishop to f4 or gS indicates that Black should strongly con sider ...cS as his reply (immediately or within
188 MASTERING THE CHESS OPENINGS
the next few moves), rather than ...eS, which is the normal KID move. You'll find the ...cS strategy all the more effective if Black can nudge White's bishop to h4 (via ...h6) or g3 (via ...h6 and ...gS). Why? Because moving that bishop removes a defender from White's queen side, so the moves ... 'i\¥b6 and ... \Was become more attractive. Of course, the reverse is also true: from White' s side of the board, we can say that if Black' s bishop goes to fS or g4, he should strongly consider playing c4. This comes up many times in the Queen's Gambit and Slav chapters. A primitive example is the Trompowsky At tack 1 d4 tll f6 2 .Ill. gs, when of course Black can play 2 ... e6, 2 ...dS, or even head for a King's In dian Defence by 2 ... g6 (allowing 3 .i.xf6 exf6, which may or may not be to his taste). But there are two major lines involving a ...cS counter-at- tack: the immediate 2 ... cS (when ... \Rb6 will generally follow if possible), and 2 ... tlle4, when play can go 3 .i.h4 cS ! or 3 .i.f4 cS ! followed by ... \Rb6 or ... \WaS+, depending upon the circum stances. Another case in point is the Griinfeld Defence, in which the .lli. f4 variations for White tend to be answered by ...cS. The associated warning is simply that, be fore developing your queen's bishop early on in a 1 d4 opening, take care to anticipate and pre pare for any queenside attack by your oppo nent. Naturally there are plenty of instances in which it is completely safe and even best to do so (e.g., variations involving ... \Rb6 tend to be inferior versus 4 .Ill. gs in the Queen's Gambit Declined), so don't be intimidated, just proceed with caution. At any rate, let's take a look at the line S .Ill. gs h6 6 .lll. h4 cS (as seen in our last diagram) 7 dS (7 dxcS \WaS 8 .lli. d3 \WxcS with equality; again the bishop on h4 is not available to bother Black's queen) 7 ...gS 8 .i.g3 \WaS ! (D). 9 .lli. d3 (to parry the threat of 9 ... tllxe4; 9 \Rd2 is natural, but on d l White's queen was watching over hS, whereas with the queen on d2, 9 .. . tllhS ! followed by . .. tllxg3 would be both playable and good; the two bishops and beautiful long diagonal are particularly strong in this case) 9 ... tll xe4! (a known trick, which is again successful due to the absence of White's dark-squared bishop from the queenside) 10 .i.xe4 .lll. xc3+ 1 1 bxc3 \Rxc3+ 1 2 <t>fl fS ! (either winning the bishop on e4 or trapping the other one by ...f4). Then: a) 1 3 �c l \Rf6 (or 1 3. .. \Rb2 ! 14 l:Ic2 \Rf6, in order to have the last rank available, a nice refinement) 14 h4 (14 \WhS+ <t>d8 l S h4 g4 1 6 .lli. d3 f4) 14. ..g4 l S .lli. d3 f4 1 6 tlle2 fxg3 1 7 lllxg3 �f8 1 8 l:Ic2 tlld7 19 \Rxg4 tlleS with a large advantage for Black, Spassky-Fischer, Sveti Stefan/Belgrade ( 1 6) 1992. b) 13 tlle2 \Rf6 14 .lll. c2 f4 lS h4 l:If8 ! 1 6 hxgS hxgS 17 lll xf4?! gxf4 1 8 .lli. h2 (Black's point is 18 .lll. h4 l:Ih8 !) 18 ... tlld7 19 g3 tlleS 20 \WhS+ <t>d8 21 gxf4 tllg4 22 l:Iel l:Ih8 23 .lll. h7 \Rg7 0- 1 Stein-Geller, USSR Cht (Moscow)

In doing so, we run into a couple of thought provoking issues. Surprisingly, Black needn't be too afraid of S eS tll e8 6 f4 d6 because White will have diffi culty maintaining his centre in the face of ...cS; for example, 7 lll f3 cS 8 d5 (8 dxcS tll c6 with tremendous compensation if White tries to hang onto his pawn by multiple exchanges on d6; see how the bishop on g7 comes to life) 8 ... .lll. g4 9 .lll. e2 (9 \Re2 .i.xf3) 9 ... .lll. xf3 10 .lll. xf3 dxeS 1 1

On the other hand, a conventional move such as S .i.gS, which we just saw is not dangerous if ...d6 has already been played, can be trickier af ter S ...d6 6 \Rd2 (now there's no ...h6/ ...gS se quence); or S ...h6 6 .lll. e3 ! and Black lacks the normal harassing move ... tllg4 while he has weakened his kingside.

This incomplete discussion of 4 ...O-O isn't directly important (after all, hardly anyone plays the move!), but we can begin to get a feel for typical King's Indian considerations.
5 f4 (D)
The Four Pawns Attack, White's most ambi tious approach and probably the first one that would occur to a player who has never seen the King' s Indian, but knows the importance of central control and occupation by pawns. In the 1 920s when the King's Indian became more than a curiosity, the Four Pawns was indeed used by the likes of Alekhine, Bogoljubow. among other leading players. The dynamic possibilities and chances for a quick knockout were surely considerations in their reaction. Most textbooks (and this one) will show some examples of the triumph of the centre in other openings; e.g., something along the lines of I e4 eS 2 lll f3 tllc6 3 .lll. c4 .Ill. cs 4 c3 tllf6 5 d4 exd4 6 cxd4 .lll. b6? 7 dS tlle7 8 eS and Black's pieces are driven into passivity as a result of the unopposed onslaught by White's centre pawns. How much better it should be to play moves like eS and dS, when they are protected by pawns on either side! Furthermore, Black is supposed to stake a claim in the centre before he is overrun, right? Of course, it's not so easy for White; advantages of this nature always have their accompanying disadvantages. In the case of the Four Pawns KID, we see that the pawns on c4 and f4 are also restricting the scope of White's bishops on fl and c l . Perhaps this isn't a dominant concern because once the pawns advance, at least one is normally ex changed. For example, in the main lines Black will trade off his e-pawn for White's c-pawn or e-pawn. Still, the cost in time to erect such a centre has to be considered. Furthermore, the advance of pawns in any chess opening leaves open the risk that they might become weak. In the Four Pawns KID. we see that the squares e4 and d4 are no longer able to receive the support of the pawn moves c3 and f3, so they are more exposed to attack: this is particularly true of d4, since it is indi rectly attacked by Black's bishop on g7 and can be disturbed by the pawn moves ...c5 and ...e5. Furthermore, the squares e3 and d3 may be considered 'interior weaknesses', since they are also without support. In most situations. inte rior weaknesses on the third rank are difficult to exploit, being within the defensive range of so many pieces. But that can be a different matter if the centre in front of them is compromised. If and when White's pawns advance further to d5 and/or e5 (which is the plan, after all), e4 and d4 become interior weaknesses as well. Then
190 MASTERING THE CHESS OPENINGS
those front pawns are within range of Black' s forces, which are waiting on the second and third ranks for just such an opportunity to tear into the ill-protected foot soldiers. That worst case scenario for White would result from his over-enthusiasm. It turns out that White should usually marshal his pieces to support the centre pawns and wait for the right opportunity to press forward. Or in some cases he will count upon them as cramping influences and forego a gen eral advance indefinitely. These methods pro vide the rationale for White' s entire enterprise. 5 ... O-O 6 lll f3 (
D)
B
These first six moves are normally played (6 i.e2 will follow in this note). How does Black react to this powerful front, and how does he get his pieces out to any but passive squares? There are three basic ideas. One is to grab one's share of the centre directly by ... e5, which is not im mediately feasible. and unfortunately the prepa ratory 6 ... tll bd7 is met by either 7 e5 or 7 i.d3 without giving Black sufficient counterplay. So Black needs to snipe at the centre from a dis tance, preferably using his bishop on g7. He can therefore consider 6 ... c5, which tries to extend the scope of Black's bishop on g7 and attack the centre at the same time. Something similar can occur after 6 ... tlla6, but in that case ...e5 be comes a major idea and piece placement is a key for both sides. The resulting battle will demon strate many themes universal to the KID. Taken as a whole, the Four Pawns Attack gives us a thorough course in the handling of broad centres by both sides. Before moving on, the often-played 6 .lll. e2 (presumably to avoid 6 tll f3 i.g4) restricts White's options in a number of lines, notably 6 ...tlla6. White might want to try the move order 7 .lll. e3, to control c5 after 7 . . .e5 8 fxe5 dxe5 9 d5. But Black can also get ambitious after 6 .lll. e2 by the underrated 6 ...e5 ! ; for ex ample, 7 dxe5 (7 fxe5 dxe5 8 d5 tlla6 with equality; compare the 6 ... tlla6 main line, where White has been limited to the move i.e2 in stead of the important options that he enjoys there, in particular .lli. d3) 7 ...dxe5 8 \Rxd8 �xd8 9 fxe5 lll fd7 (D). This is the first of a lot of King's Indian posi tions in which White tries to make something of his extra pawn and direct threats. Given an extra move, Black will have the advantage because of White's inferior pawn-structure, so White must strike first: 10 tll d5 (10 e6 fxe6 covers d5; then Black can turn his attention to occupying the weak squares e5 and d4) 10. .. tlla6 1 1 .lll. g5 .l:Ie8 12 tll e7+ @f8 1 3 tllxc8 .l:Iaxc8 14 .lll. g4 (other wise Black captures on e5 exposing the isolated pawn behind it) 14 ... tllxe5 ! (a positionally-moti vated exchange sacrifice; instead, 14 .. .f5 1 5 exf5 lll xe5 is equal) 1 5 .lll. xc8 �xc8 (D). Black controls every important square and has ideas like ... tlld3+, ... tllc5, ... .l:Ie8 and ... tllxc4. A sequence such as 16 .l:Idl lll xc4 17 b3 tlld6 1 8 lll f3 .lll. c3+ 19 @e2 tllxe4 may be the best that White can do, but he then stands worse be cause Black has two pawns and superior piece placement. This is worth checking for yourself. After 6 lll f3, we turn to the variations begin ning with 6 ...c5 and 6 ... tlla6. Incidentally, why don't masters play 6 ... .lll. g4? After all, that move puts pressure directly on White's vulnerable d4-square by pinning the
KING 'S INDIAN DEFENCE 191
knight and sometimes threatening to exchange it. In conjunction with a combination of moves like ...c5, ... tllc6 and/or ...e5 this is certainly at tractive. For no obvious or even logical rea sons, the specifics of the position interfere. A good line for White is 7 .lll. e3 (often the bishop on this square is vulnerable to ... tll g4, but not this time) 7 ... tllfd7 ! ? (the thematic move in such positions, supporting ...e5 or ...c5 and un masking the bishop; instead, 7 ... .lll. xf3 8 \Rxf3 e5 9 fxe5 dxe5 1 0 d5 favours White, who will play O-O-O; in this type of position, check to see if White has a bishop on e3 fighting for c5) 8 h3 ! ? (White loses a tempo in order to set up the idea that follows; 8 .lll. e2 is also advantageous since d4 is well covered) 8 ... i.xf3 9 \Rxf3 e5 (9 ... c5 ! ? 10 d5 .lll. xc3+! 1 1 bxc3 \Ra5 has posi tional points in its favour, but White still has his advantage on both wings with his space and bishop-pair after simply 12 .lli. d2, .lll. e2 and O-O; also, 9 ... tllc6 falls short due to 10 e5 !) 10 dxe5 ! ( 1 0 fxe5? runs into the surprise 10. ..c5 ! - a tac tic to remember, since it applies to other posi tions) 10 ...dxe5 1 1 f5 (D). In spite of his command of d4, Black lacks sufficient compensation for White's bishop-pair and the eventual attack by playing g4. This is not at all obvious, so let's go a few moves further and look at two moves: a) 1 1 ...tll c6 12 O-O-O lll d4 13 \Rf2 c6 (13. ..c5
14 g4 \Ra5 15 @bl and White simply marches
forward with moves such as g5 and h4-h5 in some order, with tlld5 another potential factor)

b) 1 1 ....lli. h6! ? 1 2 O-O-O! ( 1 2 .lll. xh6 \Rh4+) 1 2. .. .lll. xe3+ 1 3 \Rxe3 (D). We have reached one of those fairly common cases in which exchanging a 'bad' fianchettoed bishop (in this case on g7) for the opponent's very good one (on e3) can be disadvantageous due to the weaknesses left unprotected; for ex ample, 1 3. .. tll c6 14 g4 tlld4 and Black has a su perb knight versus a very bad bishop and yet after 1 5 h4 he is in serious trouble in the face of g5 and h5; for example, 15 ...c6 16 tlle2 (a sim ple move to get rid of Black's best piece; also good is 16 i.d3 \Re7 17 g5) 16 ... tll xe2+ ( l 6 ...c5 17 lll c3!) 17 .lll. xe2 \Re7 (17. ..\Rb6 1 8 \Rh6; Black could use a bishop on g7 !) 1 8 h5 Ii:.ad8 ( 1 8. ..g5 19 .l:Ixd7 !) 19 hxg6 fxg6 20 .l:Ih6! \Rg7 2 1 c5 ! tllxc5 22 i.c4+ @h8 23 .l:Idh l .l:Id4 24 \Re2 .l:Ixe4 25 fxg6! and wins.

This is Black's traditional main line. He at tacks the centre at its weakest point on d4; but at the same time wants to unleash the power of the bishop on g7. 7 d5 There are two frequently-used ways to devi ate from this natural move: a) White might want to take the King's In dian player out of his normal channels by 7 i.e2 cxd4 8 l2'lxd4 (D).

White aims for a Maroczy Bind structure (characterized by c4 and e4). This is a safe choice, but compared to the Sicilian Defence version in Volume 1, the move f4 instead of f3 weakens e4 and makes it easier for Black to find counterplay; for example, 8 ... lba6!

From the position after 9 cxd5, I'll present a short overview of the daring 9 ... ctJbd7 and then look at two main moves, 9 ... l:.e8 and 9 ... i.g4, citing games with a selection of the most essen tial treatments and tactical motifs of the Four Pawns. Several of these also apply to other openings. The main alternative 9 .. .b5 ! ? ex presses a different philosophy, trying to divert White from protection of his centre. The first threat is ... b4, which limits White's options. If White plays the obvious move 10 i.xb5?!, Black has a tactic that you simply have to know if you're playing the King's Indian or Benoni with either colour: 10 ... lbxe4!

This brings to the fore the conflict between White's direct e5 and Black's attempts to destroy the central pawns before they strangle him.

'i!Yb6 ( D) 13 'i!Yd2!? An exciting move invented by the Four Pawns theoretician Blokh.

OK, this is all theory (and was at the time), but it shows the near-perfect balance between at tack and defence that typifies this main line of the 9 ... l:i.e8 Four Pawns Attack. 13 ... ctJd7 It's always a critical decision for Black whether to capture the important e-pawn.

Piskov - Parmentier Budapest 1989 10 ctJd2 (D) At first this move looks passive, merely pro tecting e4, but it has a very dynamic plan be hind it: White wants to get his knight to c4 and force e5 through. Why not just leave the knight on f3 and do the same? For one thing, advanc ing to e5 immediately gambits a pawn, as in the previous game. It also happens that a knight on c4 is ideally placed to attack the d-pawn (and the d6-square itself) if, for example, Black plays ...ctJfd7 at some point. Another very important advantage to lbd2-c4 is that a bishop can go to f3 to strengthen White's centre. Then if White
198 MASTERING THE CHESS OPENINGS
plays e5, this piece will defend the d-pawn against attack and can grow greatly in range. The formation with a bishop on f3 and knight on c4 also allows a rook on e 1 to provide direct support for a central thrust. Finally, it turns out that there is a dangerous sacrifice initiated by e5 and then playing ctJc4 with tempo. What should Black do? It's all a matter of timing. First of all, ctJc4 isn't a threat yet be cause the pawn on e4 hangs. Queenside activity is called for to activate his pieces before White can implement his plan. Specifically Black would like to play ...b5 and/or ...c4 to try to get a knight to squares like d3. 10 .•. lba6 A good defensive example was 10 ...a6 1 1 a4 lbbd7 12 O-O c4!? 1 3 @hl (13 lbxc4 lbxe4 14 lbxe4 l:.xe4 is equal, and has the point 1 5 ctJxd6??

This results in a position in which Black's play is almost ex clusively of the queenside, involving expansion and routing his pieces in that direction. White either plays in the centre by marshalling his forces to break through on the restricted square e5, or uses pawn advances on the kingside to launch a direct attack on that lightly-populated area of the board.

ctJf3 ctJa6 ( D) At first this may seem to be a strange way to counter a formation so imposing as the Four Pawns. As it happens, moving a knight to the rim is routine in the King's Indian Defence and relates directly to the centre. For one thing, the usual choices of a square for this piece are: a) c6, where it can be attacked by d5, and b) d7, where it gets in the way of Black's light-squared bishop. In this particular situation neither of those options is realistic. The strategy behind ... ctJa6 is to play ...e5 and then have the c5-square available for the knight in case White grabs the e5-pawn and tries to hold it. That will yield ac tive play. On a secondary level, 6 ... lba6 is a waiting move to see what White is up to. Black can still change his mind about ...e5 and play something like ... i.g4 or ...c5 instead. 7 i.d3 This is probably the most logical continua tion if White is planning to answer ...e5 with d5 at some point. Then his e-pawn is covered, a nice thing in view of a coming ... ctJc5. Some of the alternatives are just as important, how ever. a) 7 e5 might be the Four Pawns player's in stant reaction, since it stops ...e5 and at first the knight on a6 doesn't look relevant with regard to central play. But the latter part isn't true. 7 ... lbd7 (D) follows, when Black is about to play ...c5. Then one of several ideas is 8 i.e2 (White would like to be able to play d5 in response to ...c5 without losing his e-pawn; the only move that keeps the pawns intact on d5 and e5 is 8 'i!Ye2, but then 8 ...c5 9 d5 lbb6! prepares ...e6 to crack open the e-file vis-a-vis White's queen. so 10 i.e3 i.g4! could follow, with good play for Black) 8 ...c5 9 exd6 exd6 (9 ... cxd4 10 lbxd4 ctJb6 1 1 O-O iixd6 12 i.e3 leaves White's pieces nicely centralized, and 12. .. ctJc5? fails to 13 ctJdb5) and now: al) 10 O-O is reasonable.

5 ••.O-O 6 .i.e2 White's overwhelming favourite. As always, there are many options; for example, 6 h3 and 6 .i.g5. 6 ... e5 (D) Also almost automatic, although 6 ... tt'lbd7 can safely introduce ...e5, as explained in the 6 ...e5 7 O-O tt'lbd7 line of this chapter. 6 ...c5 is outside the scope of the discussion, sometimes transposing to a Maroczy Bind Sicilian (7 O-O cxd4 8 tt'lxd4) or to some kind of Benoni (7 d5). For a discussion of why exactly Black takes two moves to fianchetto his bishop and then promptly turns it into a bad bishop, see the dis cussion of this very subject in Volume 1 , Chap ter 2. From the position after 6 . .. e5, it's difficult to select some variations to talk about while ig noring others. As always, I shall try to discuss variations that are important for practical play, but even more so ones whose characteristic positions will apply to other variations in the King's Indian and openings in general. The fol lowing section is fitting that regard. Exchange Variation 7 dxe5 dxe5 White exchanges pawns and then queens. He either hopes that his quick development will al low him to get the better game, or that the sim plified position will suit his playing styl e. Some players use the Exchange Variation to obtain a draw, but that is a tricky business, to say the least. I repeatedly point out in this book that queenless middlegames are not end games. That is all the more the case with so many pieces left on the board. 8 'iVxd8 Although 8 O-O is sometimes tried, this ex change is really the point of 7 dxe5. Upon slower moves, Black can develop freely and gain time to cover the d5-square against inva sion. 8 . . • l:txd8 (D) The Exchange Variation may appear rather dull, and even a reason to avoid playing the King's Indian Defence. But the variation em braces positional ideas that are basic to KID play. First of all, you should always keep in mind that in most chess openings, the early exchange of queens will not eliminate winning chances for either side, and in some cases may even in crease them. With that in mind let's try to under stand what's going on in general terms. Initially White counts upon his central space and rela tively fast development (e.g., by .i.g5, tt'ld5 and O-O-O). These represent short-term advantages
206 MASTERING THE CHESS OPENINGS
that might be transformed into something more permanent. But White also cedes his opponent a true outpost on d4; a knight occupying that square will generally have great influence, so much so that White will usually not be able to gain concrete advantages by 'working around' it. If Black successfully implements the move ... c6. it leaves White's knights and rooks without the d5 pivot point, whereas the d6 point isn't easily accessible to knight nor to more than tem porary occupation by a rook (Black responds by ... tl:Je8, ... .i.f8, etc.). The situation with respect to each side's bishop is also significant. White's dark-squared and Black's light-squared bishops have excellent scope - they are 'good'. But White has to deal with a very bad bishop on fl (cut off by both the c- and e-pawns), whereas Black has blocked off his own bishop by ...e5. The second situation is not so grave in that Black strengthens his control of d4 thereby, and later the g7-bishop can be activated by a couple of different methods. A typical way to enliven things is ... .i.f8 and ... .i.c5 or ... .i.b4 as appropri- ate. Even ... .i.f6-d8-b6 puts the bishop on an ef- fective diagonal. How these trade-offs play out will determine the course of the game. As indicated, Black will attempt to post a piece on d4. Sometimes the move .. .f5 can be useful but that is generally not played until the pieces are reorganized. The c5-square is also crucial: a knight occupying it hits several im portant points in the enemy position, and the potential for ... tt'le6-d4 can cause White head aches. If Black gets a knight to c5 he will gener ally try to support it by ...a5. Finally, .. J'!e8 < protecting the e-pawn) and ... tt'ld7-f8-e6 may prove feasible. For his part White would love to achieve the moves b4 and c5 (or tt'la4 and c5), opening up the fl -a6 diagonal for the previously passive bishop and clearing c4 for pieces (a knight, for example, might travel to it by tt'ld2-c4). An other set-up is with a3, b4, .i.e3 and tt'ld2-b3. Once Black plays ...c6 and ...a5, his b6-square can be inviting to White's pieces. Finally, as mentioned before, White's lead in development may help him to force changes in the initial pawn-structure which, if it persists, will favour Black in the long run. Let's start out with a game in which White succeeds in achieving his goals. 9 .i.g5 Born - Tonneman corr. 1978 9 tt'ld5 tt'lxd5 10 cxd5 c6 1 1 .i.c4 cxd5 ! ? 12 .i.xd5 tt'ld7 1 3 .i.g5 l:te8 transposes to the next game. 9 ... .l:!.e8 10 O-O-O Again, 10 tt'ld5 tt'lxd5 1 1 cxd5 c6 12 .i.c4 cxd5 can transpose, but 12. ..b5 1 3 .i.b3 c5 !? is also played.

White wants to play f3 to solidify his centre, and by playing tt'lel he avoids ... .i.g4 (when ... .i.xf3 would strengthen Black's control of d4). Most importantly, he wants to bring his knight to the queenside to support expansion on that wing.

6 .i.e2 e5 7 O-O White normally chooses not to enter into the Exchange Variation, which can be understood from the examples in the last section. 7 O-O is the most flexible move, not committing to any central pawn-structure. Strongpoint Variation 7 ••• tt'lbd7 (D) This solid knight development was the pri mary way of playing for several decades after the King's Indian Defence first gained attention in the 1920s. During that time 7 ... tt'lbd7 natu rally generated many new ideas and wonderful games, but now has been overtaken by 7 ... tt'lc6 and 7 ... tt'la6. Nevertheless, specialists still find ways to benefit from it, sometimes moving be yond minor improvements to new methods of play. One appealing feature of 7 ... tt'lbd7 is that it is a central move and thus stays in contact with c5, e5 and f6, all key King's Indian squares. Compare 7 ... tt'la6, which only controls c5; or 7 ... tt'lc6 8 d5 tt'le7, a two-move continuation based largely upon transfer to the kingside. Situ ated on d7, Black's knight can be used to support e5 as a strongpoint, or to play ... ctJe5 or ... tt'lc5 if Black chooses to play ... exd4 at some point. The disadvantages of 7 ... tt'lbd7 relate pri marily to its failure to challenge White's space advantage and the fact that it blocks off Black's bishop on c8. This latter circumstance (which you' 11 note does not apply to 7 ... tt'la6 or 7 ... tt'lc6) means that achieving the move . . .f5 may be problematic, and that White can keep the centre fluid without worrying as much about immedi ate attacks on the kingside. Thus Black is un likely to dominate one side of the board or the other, although he has access to and plays on both wings. Another drawback has to do with a concrete feature of the King's Indian, that c7 is left unprotected, so that Black hasn't as much leeway to move his queen as he does after 7 .. . tt'la6. I haven't mentioned the greatest virtue of 7 .. .tt'lbd7 from our point of view: the play stemming from this move includes a majority of themes and concepts that characterize the entire Classical King's Indian! After 7 ... tt'lbd7 we see properties of the KID that don't appear after 7 ... tt'lc6 8 d5 tt'le7 (the main line of most of this chapter). For example, lines in which Black plays . . . tt'lc5 or . . .exd4, and situations in which White plays dxe5 in a more effective way than in the Exchange Variation. For those reasons we'll delve into some details of three variations:
KING 'S INDIAN DEFENCE 209
A: 8 .i.e3; B: 8 l:tel ; C: 8 d5.
A}
8 .i.e3 (D) This is the most common and highly-re garded move, of which I'll give two examples: 8 .•• 'll g4 Donaldson - Browne Reno 1992 a) 8 ...a5?! was played for some time with considerable success. In fact, a great blow to 7 ... 'llbd7 adherents was delivered when White found the right plan: 9 dxe5 ! dxe5 10 'iVc2 (10 c5 ! is another way to implement White's strat egy; the tactical point is that Black can't win White's c-pawn after 10. .. 'll g4 1 1 .i.g5 f6 due to 12 'iVd5+ @h8 1 3 .i.d2!? c6 14 'iVd6) 10. .. tllg4 1 1 .i.d2 ! c6 ( 1 l ...f5? 1 2 h3 'll h6 13 .i.g5 !) 12 tlla4! (D). Here is a great example of what can happen in any King's Indian if the centre is fluid, as op posed to the 7 ... 'llc6 8 d5 lines when a locked structure arises. If White can play dxe5 fol lowed by a pawn advance to c5, it can outweigh Black's potential occupation of d4 and f4. The combination of tlla4 and 'lld2-c4 with an open d-file can be deadly, because knights can end up on d6 and/or b6, whereas even the nominally 'bad' bishop on e2 can get into the action on c4. It should be said that with a slightly different placement of Black's pieces the position would be unclear; for example, if Black's knight were on h5 or f4 instead of g4, or if ... l:te8 had al ready made room for ... 'llf8-e6-d4 - you might want to compare the Exchange Variation above. Which positions to allow or reject is a matter of judgement and specifics. In the example we follow White goes about a similar reorganiza tion, whereas Black simply doesn't have the piece disposition to counter White' s plans: 1 2. ..h6 ( 1 2. . .f5? is even worse: 13 tllg5 !

And 9 ...c5 (D) establishes the kind of structure that gen erally favours White, particularly since Black took two moves to get his pawn there. This is a pawn-chain situation, and the two breaks are b4 and f4. The latter is less appeal ing because after ...exf4 it opens up the long diagonal for Black's bishop. Play can proceed 1 0 'llel (the standard idea to put the knight on d3 and play for b4 to break down Black's pawn-structure) 10 ...

B
Why is this obvious move relatively rare? The first-level answer is that it's somewhat awk ward for White to answer the following direct attack on the e4-pawn: 8 . . . 'bc5 9 �c2 White only has two reasonable ways to pro tect his pawn, neither without drawbacks. 9 'Lld2 blocks the development of the queen's bishop. It is generally answered by 9 ... a5 (secur ing Black's knight from being kicked out by b4), when for the moment neither of White's knights can move, whereas Black can develop and begin to organize for his standard move . .. f5. That's enough to get a feel for what's going on, but let's take this a step further. If White tries 10 l:!.bl i.d7 1 1 a3?! (ready to play b4), Black answers with l 1 ...a4! (D). This is a familiar positional trick described by the phrase 'one pawn holding up two' (referring to the pawns on a4, a3 and b2). The idea of 'one pawn holding up two' is that White cannot play b3 or b4 without giving him self an isolated a-pawn on an open file, and in particular one that can be easily blockaded be cause the rook, knight, and a bishop on d7 all control a4 (for the moment, b3 or b4 would be especially awkwardly met by ...axb3, but bar ring that peculiarity the situation in general is still very good for Black). This stratagem is ob vious to the advanced player, but it may not be so to the inexperienced player, who should add it to his stock of standard patterns. Moving back, what if (after 9 'bd2 a5), White plays 10 �c2? Then play can follow along the lines of our main move; e.g., 1 0. . . 'be8, and we'll see that Black is doing fine. He also has the positionally double-edged move 10. .. i.h6 ! ? (D ), to get rid o f his 'bad' bishop. As is often the case when exchanging off a g7-bishop, Black must take care that the squares around his king don't become too weakened. On the other hand the cl-bishop is quite a

A couple of games have continued 1 1 'bb3 i.xc l 12 l:!.axc l 'bfd7 1 3 'bxc5 'bxc5, and now White should play something like 14 'VJJi d2, ready to answer 14. .. f5?!

His pieces retain maximum flexibility and the knights both cover the critical e4-square. In spite of those advantages, Black has scored well in practice after the usual pawn-storm attack 12 ... f4 13 i.f2 g5; e.g., 14 b3 (or 14 a3 !, to speed up the attack even further, when 1 4. ..a4 !? 15 i.xc5 dxc5 16 'bxa4 'VJJi e7 provides some compensa tion for the pawn), and now: a) 14 ... i.d7 15 a3 l:!.f7 16 l:!.abl i.f8 17 b4 axb4 1 8 axb4 'ba6 19 c5?!

KING 'S /ND/AN DEFENCE 21 7
The knight moves to support a kingside at tack. 8 ... 'bb8 loses too many tempi. This position, introducing what is often called the Mar del Plata Variation, is the most popular one in the King's Indian Defence, and indeed one of the best-known in chess practice. I shall examine this variation in greater depth than it would normally merit because only a close in vestigation can give us an insight into how deli cately balanced the game of chess can be. The persistence of dynamic equality in variations with frenetic activity on both wings borders on the miraculous. Indeed, variations stemming from 8 ... 'be7 have survived more than 50 years of intense scrutiny by the world's strongest professionals (and computers), only to remain mysteriously resistant to solution. Players of all ages are taught this variation because it exem plifies the pawn-chain as well as the flank at tacks that are designed to break it up. From the diagram, the lines that best illus trate the traditional strategies arise from 9 'bel and 9 'bd2. In both cases White is not only initi ating a reorganization of forces but anticipating Black's plan of moving his knight and playing ... f5 in order to claim some territory. By moving his knight from f3, White does two things. First, by unmasking the e2-bishop, he prevents what is in general the most irritating knight move by Black, namely ... 'bh5; once that is played, the knight often goes to f4 and hovers uncomfortably close to White's king. After 9 'bel or 9 'bd2, Black has to shelve ... 'bh5 ideas for the time being. Black will have to be content with the move ... 'bd7 or ... 'be8 if he wishes to make way for .. .f5. Once Black's knight retreats, White is able to meet .. .f5 by bolstering his cen tre with f3, though he often avoids this until ... fxe4 is a real threat. The reason is that f3 can clarify Black' s plans, and encourage . .. f5, ... g4. etc. In a majority of games White will get a pawn to c5. Then he will: a) pile up pressure on the d6-pawn, perhaps by 'bc4, i.a3 and 'bb5; b) infiltrate down the c-file by means of some combination of doubling or tripling on it with his rooks and queen; c) if necessary, advance his a-pawn to fur ther enhance his queenside assault and in par ticular his threat to occupy the a7-square. Black on the other hand will get his pawns to f4 and g4 (sometimes supported by ...h5), in or der to: a) play ...g3 and dare White to find an an swer that avoids his sacrificial onslaught; b) play ... gxf3 and open the g-file for a di rect assault. Notice that in most Mar del Plata games. Black runs right past the base of the pawn-chain with the move ...g3, putting no pressure what soever on it! So much for traditional pawn chain theory, which would suggest ... h4-h3 in stead. It is often said that Black gets the better of this deal because his object of attack is the king. which no one can afford to lose, whereas if White captures a few queenside pawns and queenside squares, that's not immediately fatal. Indeed, Black's attack can succeed precisely because of the extra few tempi that he can use to punish White's king while his queenside and centre are collapsing. But the compensating fac tor for White is that his attack tends to proceed just a bit faster than Black's while his defensive walls are harder to breach. This not-so-delicate balance creates beautiful games on a regular basis. After 8 ... 'be7, White can also forego 9 'be I or 9 'bd2 and permit Black to play ... 'bh5 and ... f5. In those lines White will often end up playing on the queenside and kingside. The most important case of this arises when White plays 9 b4, the so-called 'Bayonet Variation· . It is very popular and also has a massive body of theory related to it. I have given it a brief treat ment at the end of the chapter. The themes
218 MASTERING THE CHESS OPENINGS
associated with 9 b4 are so variegated and tempo-dependent that only a thorough exami nation would impart to the reader genuine un derstanding and competence. Therefore I have concentrated upon two systems that feature pawn-chain themes in a wide variety of con texts. Such lengthy pawn-chains don't consis tently appear in most chess openings, and certainly not with such clarity of purpose.
9 Cbel
9 'bel (D) 9 'bel is a multipurpose move that has tradi tionally been White's most popular choice. On a fundamental level, it frees the f-pawn to go to f3 for defence (or to f4, but that move has be come rare). Apart from the functions described above that apply to both 9 'bel and 9 'bd2, the retreat to e l has its own virtues. It keeps a diag onal clear for White's bishop on c l . This turns out to be no small matter, since the move i.e3 is the key to the favourite modern variation that 9 'bel leads into. In addition, after the knight moves to d3 it supports the key pawn-break c5, attacking Black's pawn-chain. A major differ ence between this and 9 'bd2 is that White's knight on d3 can swing back to f2 for defensive purposes, i.e., to discourage Black's advance ...g5-g4. In combination with the move h3 (not always desirable because of the hole left on g3), White could actually have five defenders of g4 (queen, bishop, knight, and two pawns), with the knight being particularly important because capturing and leaving a piece on g4 is normally much better defensively than having to leave a pawn on that square. Finally, the knight will sometimes go to g2, in cases where White tries to stake out territory by g4; that plan is useful to be aware of but is not one that White imple ments much these days. There's always a drawback to any such move, and this time it has to do with the forward reach of White's knight in the two situations. Even if it has successfully supported the c5 pawn ad vance from its post on d3, White's knight is too far away Black's queenside and centre to put pressure on the d6-pawn, much less give weight to a further advance of White's queen side pawns. And of course from f2 it will do nothing in those respects.
9. •. 'bd7
There used to be more discussion about the merits of this retreat. Some books (and conven tional wisdom?) dismiss the alternative 9 .. . 'be8 (D) on the grounds that it does nothing versus White's advance c5; others that by not covering the e5-square it encourages White's f4 ad vance. But in theory there isn't anything wrong with
10 f4 exf4 1 1 i.xf4 h6 ! with ideas of . . .g5. Then
1 2 'bc2 f5 1 3 exf5 g5 followed by . . . 'bxf5 is a standard idea, with approximate equality. Black may want more, of course, but presumably White won't be thrilled with such a result. The similar 1 0 'bd3 f5 1 1 f4 exf4 1 2 i.xf4 ( l 2 'bxf4 c6 ! ?) 1 2. . .fxe4 and . . . 'bf5 is not considered bad for Black either. When assessing 9 ... 'be8, issues connected to White's move c5 are much more interesting. In several other lines of the Mar del Plata we see the knight go from d7 to f6 (to provoke White to
KING 'S INDIAN DEFENCE 219
play f3) and then backwards to e8( !) to defend Black's d6- and c7-squares, the latter being a common intrusion square for a rook, knight or queen. This is particularly the case when Black is defending against the 'bd2-c4 strategy exam ined in the next section, but also at a later stage of the main lines with 'be l . Moreover, while there are some subtleties to consider in this massively complicated situation, it turns out that Black' s defence in the older lines featuring 'bd3 (with c5) and 'bd2 (with c5 and 'bc4) don't suffer with a knight on e8. So what's the point of foregoing the immedi ate 9 ... 'be8 in favour of 9 ... 'bd7? In my opin ion, it's the fact that White's 'newer' strategy with an early a4 and attack on the a-pawn seems to gain in strength, since both the move ... b6 and the c6-square are more important in those lines. You can understand this by examining, for example, 9 ... 'be8 1 0 .i.e3 f5 1 1 f3 f4 1 2 .i.f2 g5 1 3 a4, when 1 3. . .a5 ( 1 3. . .'bg6 14 'bb5)
14 c5 'bg6 1 5 'bb5 would improve for White
upon the main ... 'bd7 lines that follow below. All this may sound picky, but anyone who is go ing to go into these heavily theoretical pawn storm variations should know something about such details. Whether the above is true is an other matter! I'm not sure that the distinction between knight retreats has ever been truly in vestigated in depth, and wouldn't be surprising if 9 ... 'be8 were revived once the details were worked out. At any rate, here's an entertaining game with various pawn-storm themes in which it was effective for a unique reason: Gelfand - Kantsler Israel 200/ 9 'bel 'be8 10 .i.e3 f5 11 f3 f4 12 ilf2 You will also see this .i.e3-f2 manoeuvre in the next section, but with Black's knight on d7 rather than e8.

There's a lot to learn by examining games with loads of theoretical content, even if you don't want to play anything of the sort. But for those of you who are either tired of or fright ened by the theoretical wilderness, 9 a4! ? (D) might be of interest: I place it in this section because it goes with the contemporary a4 ideas that are associated with 10 i.e3, and in fact Korchnoi tried 9 a4 versus Kasparov during a period when he was experimenting with several other schemes in volving that move at a later stage. The main idea is simply a5, gaining important space and extra control over b6. White's knight or rook may also use the a3-square. There's little the ory attached to this line, but a small selection of games. Here are some ideas: 9 ...a5 (after 9 ... 'Lih5, White can go ahead with 1 0 a5, when 1 0. .. tl'Bf4 1 1 i.xf4 exf4 1 2 °iVd2 favours White, and 10 .. .f5 1 1 c5 ! ? is also promising) and now: a) 10 'Liel 'Lid7 1 1 i.e3 f5 1 2 f3 'Lic5 ! ? 1 3 'Lid3 b 6 1 4 b4 'Lixd3 1 5 'iVxd3 axb4 1 6 'Lib5 'it>h8 and then: al) 1 7 °iVb3 ! ? 'Lig8 1 8 'iVxb4 tl'Bf6 with a very unclear position, Korchnoi-Kasparov, Bar celona 1 989. When Kasparov won this game, it unjustly dampened interest in 9 a4 for years. a2) 17 i.d2 ! is probably best, intending sim ply i.xb4 and then a5; White seems well ahead of the normal 10 i.e3 lines with 1 3 a4 a5. In two games with this move White stood clearly better. Even when deviating from the main lines, it still helps to study them! b) Garcia Palermo-Flores, Pinamar 2002 saw 1 0 l:!.a3 'Lid7 1 1 tl'Bh4!? f5 1 2 exf5 gxf5 1 3 f4 (D). Very interesting!

It's ironic that of all the many systems played by White after 9 ... 'Lid7, the line that most
KING 'S IND/AN DEFENCE 225
grandmasters and strong players had strongly rejected from the early days on was 10 i.e3 and 1 2 i.f2, now the most popular Mar del Plata set-up. The problem, gleaned from some horri ble experiences, was that White was taking two moves to put the bishop in a position where it would lose more tempi to Black's onrushing pawns or at least provide a target and thereby help Black to open kingside lines. One of the initial and most famous Mar del Plata games, Taimanov-Najdorf, Zurich Ct 1953, was a di saster for White, the game proceeding 1 2. ..g5 1 3 tbd3 ll:lf6 1 4 c5 lbg6 1 5 .l:!.c l .l:!.f7 ! 1 6 l:!.c2? i.f8 ! 17 cxd6 cxd6 1 8 'iVd2? g4 19 .l:!.fc l ? g3 ! 20 hxg3 fxg3 2 1 ii.xg3 tbh5 22 i.h2 i.e7 ! (D) (with the bishop headed for g5, it's hard to be lieve that White can hold the position). 23 tbbl i.d7 24 'iVel i.g5 25 ll:ld2 i.e3+ 26 'it>hl 'iVg5 27 i.fl .l:!.af8 with a winning attack. There were similar experiences in high-pro file games until players started looking in an other direction for White. Many years later, someone decided that they were tired of having their bishop on the passive square d2, which makes it so hard to get c5 in, so he took the time to look at 1 0 i.e3 again. Fairly quickly it be came evident that the earlier conceptions of how to attack the queenside and defend the kingside had evolved greatly due to the experi ences with tbd3, such that Taimanov's play seemed primitive indeed. Basically, White needs to play c5, open up the c-file and occupy it with heavy pieces, play tbb5, etc. True, an all-out pawn assault with b5-b6 is still rather slow but much more likely than after 1 0 ll:ld3. Remem ber that in the 9 ll:ld2 variation that procedure was a realistic one. The big difference is that af ter 1 2 i.f2, White has an attractive new target on a7, to be attacked in conjunction with tbb5. Upon ... a6 or ...a5, the idea of c5 and cxd6 cre ates a hole on b6. The other major difference. and the reason for the fully-fledged revival of 10 i.e3, came with ideas involving a4, most of them the inventions of Korchnoi, who has spent many years trying to refute the King' s Indian (as yet, unsuccessfully). We shall talk about them next move. What should Black be doing? Obviously it depends upon what plan White pursues (for ex ample, sometimes the straightforward c5 and I:!.c 1 are played, omitting a4 ). If there is any thing approaching a general philosophy of de fence here, it would be to leave the queenside completely alone and pursue the kingside at tack as fast as possible, sacrificing pawns if necessary but not being diverted by White"s queenside activity. Timing is everything in this line, and the faster runner generally wins. so Black should be wary of queenside moves such as ...a6 and ...b6. A major exception to this is the move 1 3. ..a5 versus 1 3 a4, currently consid- ered Black's best course. The preservation of the light-squared bishop is a priority that out weighs the loss of a tempo, so ... i.d7 may be necessary in some cases. On the other hand. Black may not want to move his knight from d7 too quickly, because it is important to force White to use an extra move to get the advance c5 in. That is, the knight on d7 will help to stop c5 and White may need to play b4 (or the clumsy ll:ld3) to enforce it. That seems trivial. but b4 is not the move that White would ideally spend time on if he could avoid doing so. On the kingside itself, Black's normal plan is to play the conventional moves .. .f4, ...g5. ... .l:!.f7-g7, ....�.f8, ... tbf6, ...h5 (if necessary). and usually throwing his g-pawn forward with out regard to doing anything but opening lines. If White captures a few times on g4 Black may Jose the g-pawn but gain both the g- and h files. If White ignores Black's pawn on g4, the move . . .g3 can be a precursor to combinative play against the white king. The other main idea on the kingside is to omit ...h5 and play ... .l:!.f6-h6 with an eye towards ... 'iVe8-h5 and direct attack. This seems more effective against .l:!.c 1 ideas than those with a4.
226 MASTERING THE CHESS OPENINGS
Unfortunately, both sides should probably know quite a lot of theory to play these lines. To some extent studying examples and playing as many games as possible will make up for straight memorization. Ideally one would do a little of both.

gS (D) Black begins the usual assault. He can also play ...h5 first, probably because he isn't happy to confront White's defensive idea g4 and wants to be able to capture the pawn if that occurs. Of course . . .h5 preempts any idea of ... l!f6-h6, but that only works in a minority of cases and may not appeal to everyone.

What is this move all about? With a4 on the board, White can more productively attack the a7-pawn (or square) with his knight on b5 and bishop on f2. This is so because ...b6 is met by a5, whereas if Black plays ... a6, tba7 has the important goal of eliminating Black's bishop on c8. As we have seen, that bishop is almost essential to Black's kingside attack. Barring
KING 'S IND/AN DEFENCE 229
that possibility, White has direct ideas such as a5 and even a6. In other cases a4 allows for a rook to come to a3 both in order to defend the kingside (e.g., Black plays ...g4 and White an swers fxg4, unmasking the rook on a3 horizon tally), and to double or triple major pieces along the c-file. Right now 13 ...a5 seems to be Black's best solution to 13 a4, which is paradoxical because it 'weakens' the queenside with tempo. But it also stops b4, which in tum makes c5 more dif ficult to achieve.

P.H.

This is the structure that he's been aiming for. \\-ith the benefit that ... l2Jc5 can be a valuable defen sive resource at some point. 15 i.el!? In many ways retreating the bishop is White· s most logical move. The reasoning is as follows: a) White needs to get b4 in. b) Once he's made that move and Black ha-; captured with the move ... axb4, White will set his eyes upon his next queenside break. which is a5 . c) Capturing on b4 with the bishop (or even aiming it that way) is the best way to achieve
230 MASTERING THE CHESS OPENINGS
a5 and continue his queenside attack. Then, whether Black captures White's pawn on a5 or not, White will gain targets on the queenside, such as c7, b6 or d6. d) Finally, by capturing on b4 with the bishop, White preserves his knight on d3 to go to f2 and protect against ...g4 in the traditional fashion. Of course there are difficulties with this procedure in terms of time; the whole thing's rather slow. White's bishop has to travel to e3, f2, el and b4, conceivably hurting his kingside defences thereby (for example, there won't be a i.gl defence). White's knight on c3 will have to get out of the way, although l2Jb5 may be a tempo well spent. And the move c5 will still be a long way from realization even after White completes the a5 plan. Nevertheless, Black's knight on d7 will have to move to f6 (or perhaps c5) at some point in order to continue with his kingside attack, at which point White's queen side chances will inevitably improve. For all that, 1 5 b4 immediately makes sense too, mainly because White must play b4 if he is going to open the queenside and he may be able to make use of the knight on b4 by, for example, going to c6 and supporting a5. However, it should be noted that a knight on c6 in the King's Indian will often be stranded there as Black moves to the kingside to pursue his at tack. Let's see a couple of the main ideas in practice: l 5. .. axb4 1 6 l2Jb5 (after l 6 ll:lxb4 l2Jc5 1 7 a5? bxa5 1 8 i.xc5 dxc5 19 l2Jd3 l2Jc6! 20 dxc6 'iVd4+ Black wins back the piece with an extra pawn and pressure) 1 6. .. l2Jf6 (DJ. 1 7 i.el ( 1 7 ll:lxb4 h5; 1 7 °iVb3 !? might plot 'iVxb4 and a5; I don't know if that's been tried) l 7 ...g4 ( l 7 ...h5 1 8 l2Jf2 ! ?) 1 8 fxg4 (White gives up a centre pawn, usually a bad idea if you can avoid it, but 1 8 i.xb4 g3 ! 1 9 h3 i.xh3 ! 20 gxh3 'iVd7 would be a dangerous standard attack; note how useful the light-squared bishop can be) 1 8. . . l2Jxe4 19 i.xb4 i.d7 20 'ifc2 l2Jg5 21 h4!? ll:le4 22 i.el l2Jg6 23 h5 ll:lg3 ! 24 hxg6 'iVh4 with a powerful attack, Chabanon-Degraeve, French Cht 1 999.

As mentioned above, once White plays tbd2 it is unlikely that he will return to defend against, say, the standard pawn attack via .. .f5, .. .f4 and ...g5-g4. On the other hand, 9 ll:ld2 supports more aggressive inten tions on the queenside. White's idea is to play c5 (ultimately this is difficult to stop) and then place the knight on c4, which exerts tremen dous pressure on Black's queenside and centre, most obviously on the d6-pawn but also sup porting b5-b6, and infiltrating by tba5-c6 in some lines. All the time, the knight keeps an eye on the e5-pawn, the foundation of Black's position. If Black lets the e-pawn go (say, by ...dxc5, when White also has a bishop on b2), then the collapse of his centre causes an imme diate crisis (essentially, he has to get through to White's king immediately thereafter). A further consideration which affects the entire course of the play is the slow pace at which White is able to mobilize his c l -bishop and a l-rook. This gives Black opportunities to play on the queen side as well. In fact, Black' s play on that wing crops up in almost every major King's Indian system. These ideas are best illustrated by example. We look at 9 ... tbe8 and 9 ...a5. There are of course numerous alternatives, with the most important being 9 ...c5. I'll forego that in favour of giving more detailed coverage of the other two moves. Pawn Race 9 . • .tbe8 (D) After both 9 ll:ld2 and 9 tbel there are dis agreements over whether 9 ... tbe8 or 9 ... ll:ld7 is more accurate. In this position I won't go into that except to say that: a) 9 ... tbd7 protects against c5, with the ca veat that after b4 White might play c5 as a pawn sacrifice; b) 9 ... ll:le8 supports d6 so that a 'traditional " plan with c5, cxd6, tbc4 and tbb5 doesn't threaten the d-pawn or the c7-square. That may be more important. See the more detailed discussion of the same choice after 9 tbel .

Somehow this great game just feels like an other few hundred King's Indians. I guess that says something about the opening! Instead of 14 �a3, White can also add fuel to his pawn advance by pushing the a-pawn first: Bunzmann - Golubev Bethune 2002

However, Black's disadvantage will very likely be within manageable bounds in any case. The view that after 9 ll'Bd2, Black can't compete against White in a pawn-race holds some truth, but only some. Queenside Manoeuvres 9 ...a5 (D) Black turns his attention to the queenside. At the very least, he wants White to spend extra time to get the move b4 in. After this minor vic tory, Black can rush off to pursue his kingside at tack, or try other ideas on the queenside, which is the strategy that most players prefer. While White gets on with a3 and b4, Black can play ... �d7 with the idea ...a4 and, more abstractly, . ..c6. There is more than one point to the latter move, but a major one is to play ...cxd5 , and af ter cxd5 to mobilize his own pieces on the queenside and neutralize White' s attack there. For example, a queen move may follow, clear ing the back rank for action, and ... ll'Bc8-b6 cov ers the key square c4. On an elementary level, ...c6 and ...cxd5 also removes a pawn from po tential attack should White eventually make queenside progress. In the meantime, Black can always make a few kingside motions to prepare a delayed attack on that side of the board. As you might expect, this is all stretching Black's forces rather thin and White is really more natu rally placed to make progress on the queenside . He has a much simpler task than Black: to evict all those jumbled pieces that we just referred to, or open queenside lines and bypass them. Ftacnik - Topalov Polanica 'Zdroj 1 995

9 b4 (D)
Here we have the popular Bayonet Variation, which I shall only briefly examine. The Bayo net is characterized by play on both wings. Be cause the move 9 b4 allows Black to claim specific squares on the queenside via ...a5 and attempt to block White's traditional advances there, we find Black concentrating upon that region of the board before he undertakes kingside action, if indeed the latter occurs at all. Ideally, some important ideas will come across in what follows, but it is essentially an very ab breviated outline of today's favourite varia tions. The following game and notes may shed a little light on the ensuing themes. Black's principal choice, both originally and in current practice, is 9 ... tt:lh5, which will be the subject of the illustrative games below. 9 ...a5 has been the primary alternative for years. Here's a recent example: 10 �a3 (10 bxa5 has also been used extensively) 10 ...axb4 (Black also plays a variety of other moves such as 10 ... tt:ld7, 10 ... tt:lh5 and 10 ... b6; at the moment it seems that several are quite playable, but that none fully equalize) 1 1 �xb4 b6 1 2 a4 tt:le8 13 tt:lb5 (this stops ...c5, an important defensive idea for Black) 13 .. .f5 14 ctJd2! @h8!?

6 �gS (D) In the Averbakh, White tries to limit Black's options while keeping his own development flexible. I won't go into all the positional trade-offs between 5 tLlf3/6 j_e2 and 5 �e2/6 �g5, but one of White's immediate ideas is to attack Black's king via °i¥d2, j_h6 and h4-h5. For this, the bishop on e2 is useful in that after 6 ...h6 7 j_e3, 7 ... tLlg4 is prevented. Another motivation for 5 j_e2 and 6 �g5 is to prevent the natural 6 ...e5?? because of 7 dxe5 dxe5 8 °i¥xd8 l:i.xd8 9 tt:Jd5 tLlbd7 10 l:i.dl !

Naturally Black has alternatives. The popu lar 6 ... tLla6 is a typical modem move which can lead us back to the structures that we saw in the Classical KID lines with ... tt:Jbd7. For example, 6 ... tt:Ja6 7 °i¥d2 e5 8 d5 c6 9 j_d3 tt:Jc5 10 �c2 a5 1 1 tLlge2 cxd5 12 cxd5 �d7 13 a4 (D).

1 d4 ll'Bf6 2 c4 g6 3 ll'Bc3 �g7 4 e4 d6 5 f3 (D)
The Samisch Variation is characterized by White's desire to protect his central squares e4 and d4, the first by a pawn and the second by pieces. This set-up is more difficult to attack by the means that we saw in the Classical Variation. If Black plays ...e5 and White replies d5 (by no means forced; see the first game), his favourite attack by ... f5-f4 and ...g5-g4 will achieve less for two reasons. First, White won't have to go through gyrations like ll'Bf3-el in order to attack on the queenside; that is, the moves f3 and j_e3 come without hindrance. Moreover, White will often castle queenside and sidestep a direct at tack on his king. He can then attack on either or both sides of the board, by means of h4-h5 or b4 and c5. I'll present examples below. Black has many approaches to the Samisch, but in general has benefited from remaining flexible. For some time now, 6 ...c5 has been the main weapon of top players. As in the Aver bakh Variation, we'll see Black trying to pry open the long diagonal. Of course, there is a very wide variety of other strategies that both players can employ after 5 f3. My primary goal
KING 'S INDIAN DEFENCE 241
is to show a couple of typical structures that do not arise in the Classical lines. Samisch with . . . es Shirov - Kasparov Dortmund 1992 5 ...O-O 6 �e3 e5 7 lllge2 c6 8 °i¥d2 ll'ibd7 9
O-O-O (D)
Here White is content to keep the centre fluid for the time being, much as he does in variations such as 1 d4 lllf6 2 c4 g6 3 ll'Bc3 �g7
4 e4 d6 5 ll'Bf3 O-O 6 �e2 e5 7 O-O ll'ibd7. At any
point he can play d5, which leads to another large set of variations and subvariations. Now the challenge is for Black to scare up play ver sus White's advantage in space. He does so by expanding on the queenside. 9 ...a6 10 @bl b5 11 ll'icl White needs to protect c4 and clear the way for his bishop on fl . The moves d5 and c5 are in the air, sometimes supported by a knight on b3. Black sidesteps them both. 11 ... exd4 12 �xd4 l:i.e8!? ( D) Kasparov voluntarily gives up his grip on the centre by ... exd4 in order to open the long diag onal for his g7-bishop and the e-file for his rook. As in many variations of the King's In dian Defence (and for that matter in the Sicilian Defence), this creates a weak pawn on d6 that is a direct target down White's open d-file. With
12. ..
l:i.e8, Black decides that it's not worth it to defend that pawn as yet. In fact, he also opens a square for the move ... �f8, which in some vari ations provides solid support for that pawn. 13 �xf6!? Shirov accepts the sacrifice, but in doing so gives up the valuable dark-squared bishop that opposes its black counterpart. With hindsight, safer and more effective alternatives were found; for example, modem theory concentrates upon 13 �f2 and 13 ll'Bb3. But I'll stick to my main theme rather than get lost in those options. 13• .• °i¥xf6! 14 °i¥xd6 °i¥xd6 15 l:i.xd6 ll'Be5
(D)
Remember that attacks can be just as deadly in queenless middlegames as when the queens are still on the board. For his pawn, Kasparov has two beautiful bishops as opposed to White's bad bishop, and his eye is on the king. Black's immediate intention is to play ...�e6, some times in conjunction with ...i.f8, exploiting White's weak dark squares. Nevertheless, White is still a pawn ahead, which is no small matter. 16 f4!? It's almost impossible to resist driving away the beautiful knight, especially as what follows

j_e3 e5 There are funny move-order issues here. Black can play 6 ... t2Jbd7, intending to set up a system that avoids weakening d6; for example, 7 °i¥d2 c6 8 O-O-O a6. A popular option after 6 ... t2Jbd7 is 7 t2Jh3 ! ? (since ...�xh3 isn't possi ble), with the basic idea of t2Jf2 and perhaps t2Jd3. Both sides' strategies are typically flexi ble and at that point Black sometimes reverts to 7 ...e5 8 d5 t2Jh5, when White's knight may stay on h3 to help on the kingside. And so forth. It takes some study to master these nuances.

9 O-O-O (D)
9 ...f4?! This familiar advance is Black's most primi tive approach, imitating the one that he uses against the Classical King's Indian. Perhaps my designation of '?!' is a bit harsh, but ...f4 is gen erally not a good idea for the reasons mentioned above. We shall examine it because the result ing positions illustrate White's core strategy versus ... e5/ ...f5 in clearest form. This situation can also arise in other variations in the Samisch such as 5 f3 O-O 6 .i.e3 lt:Jc6 (with a later ...e5); it is also seen in the King's Indian Attack, and even in the Modem Defence ( l .. .g6). Over the years, Black has had more success with the flexible 9 ... lt:Jd7, preparing ... tt:Jdf6 or ...lt:Jc5. White can react in various ways; a classic and still popular possibility is 10 .i.d3

Now: a) 10. .. tt:Jdf6 1 1 lt:Jge2 introduces another classic line. It affords White multiple choices such as exf5 followed by lt:Jg3, or simply h3, preparing g4.

This variation begins with a pawn sacrifice in order to enhance the power of Black's bishop on g7 and to increase control of the dark squares in general. Remember that when White plays d4, c4 and e4, his most vulnerable square is d4, be cause it can't be supported by adjacent pawns. 7 dxc5 This variation is presented for instructional purposes; otherwise I would need to go into the alternatives 7 lt:Jge2 and 7 d5.

8 Grunfeld Defence
1 d4 tL'Bf6 2 c4 g6 3 tbc3 d5 (D)
With 3 ... d5, Black sets White an entirely dif ferent set of problems from those he does with the King's Indian Defence (3 ... .\lg7 followed by ...d6). Black challenges the centre immedi ately, and temporarily prevents White's advance e4. The combination of a dark-square strategy ( ...g6 and ... .llg7) with a light-square one (the move ...d5 will often lead to concentration upon the queenside light squares) is unusual in In dian systems where, at least initially, a particu lar colour complex is the focus of play (light squares in the Nimzo- and Queen's Indian, and dark squares in the King's Indian and Benoni). Similarly, the Queen's Gambit Declined and Slav Defences begin with concentration upon light squares. This attention to both colour complexes lends a particular flavour to the Griinfeld. In the main lines, when White captures on d5 and Black re captures with the knight followed by ... tbxc3, he immediately focuses on the dark squares ( ... .llg7, ... c5, ... tbc6 and ... .llg4), but soon turns his attention to light squares, either for purposes of restraint or occupation ( ...b6, ....llb7, ...e6, .. .f5 and ... tbc6-a5 or ... tL'Bd7-f6/b6). White too has a flexible set of formations that typically en compass both colours in the vicinity of his ex posed centre. The moves c4, tbc3, e4, 'i¥b3 and i.c4 attend to the light squares, whereas tL'Bf3/e2, .lle3 and 'i¥d2 oversee the dark squares. In addi tion, White's central advances are divided be tween e5 and d5. All this makes it difficult for those new to the Griinfeld to get a handle on what they should be doing. As is so often true, the central situation defines the optimal piece placement. If White creates a central majority by cxd5, he will gen erally concentrate upon establishing and then protecting an ideal e4/d4 structure. In a large majority of Griinfeld games by masters, White plays one of two systems that establish such a centre: A: The Exchange Variation: 4 cxd5 tL'Bxd5 5 e4 tbxc3 6 bxc3 (or 4 tL'Bf3 i.g7 5 cxd5 tL'Bxd5 6 e4 tbxc3 7 bxc3); B: The Russian System: 4 tL'Bf3 .llg7 5 'i¥b3 dxc4 6 'i¥xc4 O-O 7 e4. These are the archetypical Griinfeld varia tions, which I shall call 'Main Lines' . Black will try to undermine White's structure, nor mally by pawn attacks early on, but sometimes by piece-play first and pawn moves later (es pecially so in the case of the Russian System). In both instances we have a classic situation where one side captures the centre with support from his pawns, and the other tries to control the centre from the outside of it. I shall concen trate upon precisely that situation. Are there any elements common to all Griin feld systems? Not quite, but in most significant variations, Black plays ...c5 in order to break up White's centre. This applies to most of the main lines above but also to primary alterna tives such as 4 .llf4 .llg7 5 e3 c5 (or 5 ... O-O and 6 ...c5); 4 tL'Bf3 .llg7 5 .llf4 O-O 6 e3 c5; 4 .llg5 tL'Be4 5 .\lf4 tL'Bxc3 6 bxc3 i.g7 7 e3 c5; 4 tL'Bf3 i.g7 5 e3 O-O 6 .lle2 (or 6 .i.d2 or 6 .i.d3) 6 ...c5; 4 tL'Bf3 .llg7 5 i.g5 c5 (5 ... tL'le4 6 i.f4 tbxc3 7 bxc3 c5), etc. In addition, we have 4 f3 c5, 4 h4 c5 and the like. As a practical matter, Black's instinctive reaction to less ambitious White play
GRONFELD DEFENCE 249
should be an early ... c5. Black's two other stan dard methods for resolving central issues are ... dxc4 (as in the Russian System) and ...c6. But ...c6 is infrequently played, and it can easily lead into variations that are properly Slav De fences. For example, l d4 lt:Jf6 2 c4 g6 3 lt:Jc3 d5 4 lt:Jf3 i..g7 5 e3 c6 can come from the Slav move-order 1 d4 d5 2 c4 c6 3 lt:Jf3 lt:Jf6 4 e3 g6 5 lt:Jc3 i..g7, etc. The move ...c5 is therefore key to most Griinfeld lines, for reasons that are pretty obvi ous. First, it's easier for Black to attack d4 than e4. Then, you will notice that after the ex change ...cxd4 and cxd4, White's d-pawn is particularly vulnerable to the bishop on g7 and queen on d8, so that White can sometimes be pressured or even compelled to play either d5 or dxc5. The dxc5 option will often win a pawn, but it leaves White's pawn-structure shattered, with his c-pawn(s) exposed along an open c file; we shall see more about this below. The ad vance of White's d-pawn to d5 is critical in a wide variety of middlegame situations, and it will be discussed in context. Queenless middlegames appear more often in the Griinfeld than in other Indian systems. White's central majority may well be pitted against Black's queenside majority. In the Ex change Variation, without the c-pawns, Black is inclined to hold back his 2: 1 majority through out the opening and early middlegame. A fian- chetto by ...b6 is safe, and by comparison with ...a6 and ... b5, it reduces the impact of a4 and protects c5 from occupation by a knight or bishop. The further advance of Black's a- and b-pawns is usually weakening. In the Russian System, White is more likely to play d5 before .. . cxd4 occurs; in those cases, Black tempo rarily retains his 3:2 majority on the queenside, and we sometimes see a general advance by those pawns (for example, in the Hungarian Variation with ...a6 and ...b5 or the Prins Varia- tion with ... lt:Ja6 with ...c5 - see below). The moves ...c6 and ...e6 are often employed to iso late or eliminate White's pawn on d5. With or without the c-pawns, White's d-pawn can also become a passed pawn, and indeed in the queenless middlegames or endgames aris ing from our main lines it is very often the cen tre of attention. In more cases than not, the d-pawn is a strength with which Black must contend; even in the optimal cases in which he succeeds in securely blockading it, there may result only a stand-off, and White' s space ad vantage can still be a factor. Frequently, both White' s d- and e-pawns will survive long enough to be used to assist in space-gaining and attacking opportunities. We'll look at these and more specific issues as we move to the main variations. Exchange Variation The most popular variation of the Griinfeld has always been the Exchange Variation:
1 d4 lt:Jf6 2 c4 g6 3 lt:Jc3 d5 4 cxd5 tt:Jxd5 5
e4 tt:Jxc3 6 bxc3 i.g7 (
D)
Note that 4 lt:Jf3 i..g7 5 cxd5 lt:Jxd5 6 e4 lt:Jxc3 7 bxc3 is a common transposition to the contemporary 7 lt:Jf3 system. First, we shall look at an extremely instruc tive sequence: A: 7 i..e3 c5 8 �d2 . Then we' ll turn our attention to the two main-line systems: B: 7 i..c4; C: 7 lt:Jf3. These are examined in detail here because the positions are so fundamental to Griinfeld play: 7 i..e3 with 8 'i¥d2 7 i.e3 c5 8 �d2 (D) This system was made famous by Karpov's repeated use of it in his 1990 World Champion ship match versus Kasparov. The idea is not to

commit White's pieces (rooks, light-squared bishop, and knight) until Black does so. This is the best place in this chapter to look at the char acteristics of queenless middlegames. I'll lay out two game excerpts with ideas that are typi cal of the Griinfeld in general: H. Olafsson - Khuzman Moscow 2004 8 ... �a5 9 l':i.bl The tricky 9 tL'Bf3 transposes into 7 tL'Bf3 c5 8 .i.e3 �a5 9 �d2. 9 ... b6 (D) 10 i.b5+ This draws Black's bishop away from a spot on a6, from where it could exchange a pair of bishops and win light squares.

White can take com fort from the fact that the bishop on d7 blocks the d-file and is poorly placed to put pressure on White's position. However, Black is well developed and has the very useful threat of playing ...cxd4, exchanging queens, and win ning the d4-pawn if White castles. 12 tL'Bf3 The (better?) alternative is 12 tL'Be2 O-O (af ter 12. .. cxd4 13 cxd4 �xd2+ 14 @xd2 White has an advantage because Black has no way to get at his centre) 13 dxc5 (often a poor choice in positional terms, but 13 f4 .i.g4 ! gets rid of a key defender) 13. .. tL'le5 14 cxb6 axb6 (D).

Yusupov assesses this as clearly better for White. This is remarkable, since all he has is the big centre and centralized king.

Over the next few moves there are many combinations of ...b6 and/or ... lZ'Bc6. We shall take time off for a couple of these because they show strategies unique to the Griinfeld which also contain themes and manoeuvres common to other chess openings. Theory from several sources approves of some of these lines to the extent that may worry players of 7 .i.c4. But Black must be careful; for example, 7 ...b6?! 8 'ii f3 (8 lZ'Be2 i..b7) 8 ...O-O 9 e5 i..a6! ? 10 .i.d5 ( 10 'ii xa8? .i.xc4 with terrific compensation: the bishop-pair, light-square domination, etc.; White is undeveloped, and passive rooks in the middlegame are often worse than bishops) 10 ...c6 l l i..b3 'ii d7 (D) ( l l . ..'ii c7 led to a se vere disadvantage after 12 h4! ? c5 1 3 h5 cxd4 14 cxd4, with an ideal attack, in Yusupov-Tim man, Tilburg Ct (7) 1986; the general rule is that h4-h5 can work if Black has made no prog ress against the centre). 12 e6!

It rep resents a kind of classical logic: develop the bishop actively to c4 (as opposed to e2), and put the knight on e2, a square from which it sup ports the centre but cannot be pinned (as op posed to lZ'Bf3). White also castles as quickly as possible, something that is usually delayed in the variations with 7 lZ'Bf3.

Another option is 8 ... b6. Although we won't look at it here, theory's overall verdict seems to be that the move is playable with precise de fence. The attacking move 9 h4 is particularly dangerous and needs to be part of any prepara tion that one might make as Black. The text-move blocks the c-pawn, but con tains two other ideas to disturb White's game:

Black's move restricts the scope of his g7-bishop but changes the pawn-structure so that a plan like . . . b6, ... llla5, and either ... '2lb7-d6 or a well-timed ...c5 becomes possi- ble. 9 ... '2la5 10 .i.d3 .i.e6 is also played, when 1 1 .i.g5 followed by f4 has caused Black prob lems. This sort of aggressive expansion by White becomes possible when his centre pawns aren't attacked by ...c5. 9 ... b6 (D) is another popular move-order now that h4-h5 doesn't activate White's rook.

256 MASTERING THE CHESS OPENINGS
The diagram position is a demonstration of the power of White's central pawns. Although White is a full exchange down, all of his pieces are centralized and he has available an assort ment of possible moves such as ll:Be4, Re4, d6 and lZ'Bd5, with Black's f7-pawn being particu larly vulnerable and his bishop on g7 shut out. Most importantly of all, the opposite-coloured bishops ensure that White's bishop on b3 can't be exchanged off. b) The game continued 2 l ...i..xg4 22 e5 ! i..xe2 23 Rxe2. Again, White has the big cen tre. and the opposite-coloured bishops contrib ute to the winning scenario. As so often in the Griinfeld, we get a d-pawn marching down to deliver the final blow: 23 ..

Just in time. Now White has defended the d4-pawn. What are the characteristics of this main-line position? Both kings are safe, so it comes down to several factors. First of all, there's White's central majority, with pawns ideally placed on e4 and d4. That by itself isn't necessarily bad for Black, who may be able to restrain and then attack them. The question is whether the pawns can advance or cause other damage. With that in mind, let's consider what White would do if you gave him a move. The expansion via 1 1 f4 allows 1 1 ...i..g4. Playing h3 as a preparatory move can be considered, but at this point it looks slow. The advance 1 1 e5 is plausible, but creates central light-square weaknesses that Black is likely to be able to occupy. The move 1 1 d5 can be answered by l l .. .lZ'Be5 12 i..b3 b6 and ... i..a6 (or even 1 1 ...lZ'Ba5 12 i..d3 e6); in both cases White has difficulty in playing c4 to protect the centre. That suggests some ideas: l:tc 1, allowing d5 in many variations without the rook hanging, and/or a combination of 'ii d2 and i..h6. Some attack by f4 may follow later, all the more so if White can eliminate the pow erful g7-bishop by means of i..h6. If White achieves these things, his centre pawns and piece-play will control the board. What advantages does Black have? First, as usual, the c4-square is loose and a potential out post for a knight or bishop. The fact that ... lZ'Ba5 can be played with tempo is especially encour aging in that regard. Black also controls the open d-file and can play ... cxd4 to put pressure on the d-pawn and open his c-file. Since White is on the verge of consolidating as described above, that leads one towards two fundamental strategies. Black can get a rook to d8 and as sault White's centre straight on. That is the classical approach, which often begins with ... 'ii c7, giving Black the subsequent choice of ...e5 to challenge d4, or ...e6 and ...b6 to restrain White's pawns. No immediate action is taken to attack White's side of the board. Alternatively, Black can try to exploit the enemy queenside light squares as quickly as possible, ideally by moves such as ... ll:Ba5-c4 supported by the light-squared bishop, a rook on c8, pawn on b5, and so forth. One problem with this second plan
GRUNFELD DEFENCE 257
is finding a good square for the bishop on c8. Thus if Black wants to follow the light-squares strategy, he will probably require an early se ries of forcing moves to carry it out. Let' s look at both plans. Classical System 10• . . 'ii c7 (D) This is sometimes called the Smyslov Varia tion, and elsewhere the Shamkovich Variation. The traditional reason for this move is to follow up by .. J::t d8. A disadvantage to that policy is that it weakens f7, not only directly but in the long term if White plays for f4-f5. 11 l::t cl White is responding to an indirect threat of ... cxd4, although at the moment (were it Black's turn to move) 1 1 ...cxd4 12 cxd4 lZ'Bxd4 13 i..xf7+ and lZ'Bxd4 would favour White. Never theless, l::t c 1 gets off the long diagonal, protects c3, and most importantly serves as a strong dis incentive for ... cxd4. The immediate 1 1 i..f4 is also critical: l 1 .. .e5 12 i..g3 (compare 1 1 l::t c l J:i.d8 1 2 i..f4 e5 13 i..g5 !, hitting the rook) 1 2. .. lZ'Ba5 !? (12. .. 'ii e7 13 d5 lZ'Ba5 14 i..d3 f5 is equal) 13 i..d5 i.. e6! (grabbing light squares even if it means crippling one's pawns !) 14 i..xe6 fxe6 15 l::t bl a6, intending ... ll:Bc4, is equal. l l. .. l::t d8 (D) This position is strategically very rich and after many years no clear verdict has been reached. I'll give two classic but genuinely il lustrative game excerpts to demonstrate the main themes. Gligoric - Smyslov Yugoslavia-USSR 1959 This is one of the original, archetypal games that showed the latent strength of Black's posi tion. 12 h3 White wants to play f4 without facing ... .li.g4 with the idea of ... i..xe2. Since 12 h3 uses time. however, the immediate 12 f4 was nevertheless a main line for some years, with the idea 12 ... i..g4
13 f5 !? gxf5 (or 13. ..
lZ'Ba5) 14 h3 i..xe2 15 'ii xe2. This attack eventually seemed to peter out after, for example, 15. ..cxd4 16 cxd4 'ir'd6 (or 16 ... 'ii g3 17 l::t f3 'ii g6! 18 exf5 'ii f6, block ing the attack and targeting the centre, with equality) 17 exf5 ( 17 l::t xf5 lZ'Bxd4 18 i..xf7 + Rh8) 17 ... ll:Ba5 18 'ii g4 ll:Bxc4 19 l::t xc4 Rh8 with equality. Generally the disappearance of White's powerful light-squared bishop means an end to Black's problems. A logical alternative is 12 'ii d2, when Black can play the solid 1 2. .. 'ii a5 intending ... cxd4, or go for more with 1 2. ..a6!? 13 f4!? (White can also play 13 i..h6 b5 14 i..d3 'ii d7 15 i..xg7 Rxg7 16 d5; e.g., 16 ... lZ'Be5 17 c4 or 16 ...c4 17 .i.c2 e6 18 lZ'Bf4 ! ?) 13. ..b5 14 i..d3 f5 !

This is a superb dem onstration of determined pursuit of the light squares by Black. Nevertheless, White could have played better and the whole line is unclear. 12 ... b6 13 f4 e6 First, Smyslov restrains the centre.

(D) This is the key to Black's game. Without the move f5 at White's disposal, his bad bishop on e3 is reduced to defence and Black has greater pressure along the a8-hl diagonal. 17 e5 A real concession, because White no longer has an effective pawn-break. However, he main tains a space advantage. What's more, the alter native 17 exf5 exf5 would leave d4 vulnerable to the bishop on g7.

i..g4 This sortie has always been important, but has taken over modem theory for the last few decades. First let's mention the alternative 10 ... ll:Ba5 1 1 i..d3 cxd4 12 cxd4 at this point: a) It's interesting that 12 ... i..e6 looks very much like the main line 10 ... i..g4 1 1 f3 ctJa5 12 i..d3 cxd4 13 cxd4 i.. e6 below, except that White hasn't strengthened his centre by f3 (you may want to consider this again after you read the chapter). So how can it be that Black almost never plays this way? It turns out that by in serting 10. .. i..g4 1 1 f3, Black gains several ad vantages that arise in specific lines. The main difference is that he has the options of ... 'tWb6+, ... 'tWxd4+ and ... i..xd4+ (or ... i..xe3+) in some situations. Furthermore, the bishop on e3 can be attacked by moves such as ... 'tWa3 or in a few cases even ... i..h6. b) Black's attempt to force a draw by means of 12 ... ll:Bc6 (i.e. 13 i..c4 ll:Ba5, etc.) fails to do so after 13 i..b5 (13 i..c2 b6 14 i..a4 and l:tc l is also advantageous) 13. .. i..g4 (13. .. i..d7 14 l:!bl e6 1 5 'tWd2) 14 f3 .i.d7 15 l:tbl e6 16 'tWd2 with an edge. c) The most positionally interesting of devi ations with this order is 1 2. ..b6!?, with the in tention of ...e6 and ... l:te8. White has generally
GRUNFELD DEFENCE 261
gained a small advantage here by normal means ('tWd2, l:tadl and i..h6, for example), but it's not much. The game Gligoric-Tukmakov, Odessa 1975 illustrates another plan in the Griinfeld that we haven't seen. It comes up when ...e6 has been played: 13 l:!c l e6 14 e5 !? i..b7 15 lZ'Bf4 'tWe7 !? 16 'tWg4 ctJc6 17 h4! lZ'Bb4 18 .i.c4 b5 19 i..b3 (D).

White has a k:ingside bind and the better prospects. The question is one of timing: if Black can plant and keep a piece on d5 right away, he should be OK. The problem is that White not only threatens to attack on the king side but has the c5 outpost ( lZ'Bd3-c5), which en sures his superiority.
11 f3 lZ'Ba5
Issues of move-order are confusing here, but if you want to understand the position they are important. If Black now plays l 1 . ..cxd4 12 cxd4 ll:Ba5 (D) (this can also be arrived at by 10 ... cxd4 1 1 cxd4 i..g4 12 f3 lll a5), we reach this position: Then 13 i..d3 i..e6 will transpose to the main line in games below. There are, however. two differences. First, by capturing on d4, Black is allowing White the option of 13 i..d5 (D ), which is theoretically equal but can be annoying in practice.

Theory calls this equal. although Black still has to play accurately. Then there's 13 l:tc l ll:Bxc4 14 .:.Xc4. to which a lot of theory is also attached. Again Black needs to be a little careful even if winning the bishop-pair can't be objectively worse for him. Neither of these options is a problem if the pawns on c5 and c3 are retained (seebelow ). A further significant difference between l 1 . . .'2la5 and l 1...cxd4 1 2 cxd4 ll:Ba5 is that in the 'Seville Variation' below with 1 2 i.xf7+. the pawns are still on c3 and c5. whereas with the l 1 . ..cxd4 order we have 1 3 i..xf7+ :xn 14 fxg4 and those pawns are traded. (You· n have to jump ahead to make sense of this de scription.) At this point the question becomes whether Black prefers the i..xf7 + lines with the pawns still on the board. Unfortunately. one needs loads of specific study to answer that. But there's a possible saving grace. If Black believes that the best defence to the Seville ( or a good one) is to play ...cxd4 and ...e5 later (see below), then you will see that the move order is unimportant and that you don't need to
262 MASTERING THE CHESS OPENINGS

We now return to l 1 ...ll:Ba5 (D): This is the main-line position of the .i.c4 Ex change Variation. We now have two basic vari ations that have thus far been taken seriously. Seville Variation 12 i..xf7+!? It's pretty easy to see that 12 fxg4? l2Jxc4 (with tempo!) is positionally bad. We look at 12 i..d3 cxd4 13 cxd4 .i.e6 below.

White has won a pawn, which is of some value even though it consists of a doubled g pawn. His centre is superior to Black's and, given time, potentially mobile. Black has his own advantages; for example, a wonderful out post on c4 for his knight and some play against White's rather draughty kingside. In spite of a large body of theory and experi ence with 1 2 .i.xf7+, the ensuing play is not of such a critical nature that one needs to commit much to memory. I'll look at two games that should cover the main ideas and strategies. Karpov - Kasparov Belfort 1988 This game has been used in many books, de servedly so. It is representative of White's ideas and beautifully played. To get a more balanced view of the opening, see the game excerpts within the notes. ..• 'ii d6 14 ...

(D). We'll see this more than once: the problems that Black has when he sets up this blockade with ...e5, ...c5, ...b6 and ... lZ'Bd6 tend to come from a4-a5. That can be surprisingly difficult to meet, as here: 20 ...c4 (else White plays c4 and a5) 2 1 'ii c2 i..f8 22 Whl lZ'Bb7 23 lZ'igl i..c5 24 'ii e2 i..xe3 25 'ii xe3 'ii f7 26 ll:Bf3 with much the better game for White, Sakaev-Van Wely, Internet blitz 2004.

15 e5! 1Wd5 ( D) What's this? With 15 e5, White just ceded all those light squares Black loves so much! In addi tion, for a mere extra doubled pawn, White has exposed his king, given himself a bad bishop, and hardly attended to his development! For all that, there are some real dangers for Black. If, for example, White plays g5, his bishop's prob lem will be less important than that of Black's ' good' one, which is imprisoned indefinitely. Also, White has the easy-to-underestimate ad vantages of space and a central majority. Notice that if he gets moves like @gl and tl:Bf4 in, Black will have serious weaknesses to cover. For his part, Black's advantages are fairly obvious: a beautifully centralized queen on d5, an outpost for the knight on c4, and numerous possible open files for his rooks. One difficulty, however, is that he has to achieve any progress by use of his pieces alone, since he has no pawn-breaks. 16 .tf2!

The Gambit Lines 12 .td3 cxd4 13 cxd4 .te6 (D) w Now White really needs to do something about incursions on c4, because ... .tc4 threat- ens to win the light squares and ... tl:Bc4 would create immediate tactical problems. Since 14 'iVa4 a6! threatens ...b5, White has only two se rious moves that protect c4, both requiring ma terial sacrifice. The first is the gambit 14 l:i.c l .txa2 15 'iVa4. White also has the exchange sacrifice 14 d5 ! ? .txal 15 'iVxal , whose assess ment at the moment is not fully resolved. In spite of over 45 years of investigation into 14 d5 by hundreds of grandmasters, a few new ideas are still being found at the top levels. Neverthe less, the play is dependent upon countless tac tics which don't lend themselves to general understanding, so in this case there is only a limited amount to be gained through broad dis cussion of the opening as such. In fact, the spe cifics of the attack are really in the realm of the middlegame proper. Thus I shall limit my dis cussions of both 14 l:tc l and 14 d5, providing some general contours of the play. Geller's 14 :tel 14 l:tcl With this move White covers c4 and offers a pawn. Black must accept or be driven back by the move 15 d5. 14• •. .txa2 (D) This position has fascinated players and theoreticians for many decades. After many years of intense scrutiny, Black seems to have solved his problems in the very main lines with the move 1 5. .. .tb3. Whether that will re main true is still an open question, and both sides can still experiment with little-played moves. I'm only going to show one game, because White hasn't made much progress in the last few years. H illarp Persson - Rowson Torshavn 2000 15 'iVa4 (D) This is the most popular move by a huge margin: White forces Black's bishop to move and gets his pieces out as quickly as possible. Black's light-square strategy, with which we are so familiar, should work well after the straightforward attack 15 f4 a6! 16 f5 b5 17 e5.

is 15. .. .te6 16 d5 .td7, which may also be equal. Many years of theory and hundreds of high-level games have established the various ways to proceed in this position. Best play seems to be 17 �4 e6 1 8 tl:Bc3 exd5 19 tl:Bxd5 .te6 20 l::t fdl j.xd5 2 1 exd5 l::t e8 (D). This position has arisen in many games and until recently was the main line of the 14 l::t c l variation. Remarkably, my database gives a game with it that goes back to 1 978 ! At first White's positional pluses - his bishop-pair, open lines, powerful passed d-pawn, and im prisonment of the knight on a5 - led to some nice wins in spite of his being a pawn behind. Over the past few years, however, Black has been drawing most games. In the diagram, Yusupov-Leko, Istanbul OL 2000 was drawn after the simple 22 .tf2 j_f8 23 �b2 (others have tried 23 �a4 here, with ongoing action) 23 ... j_g7 24 �b4 1/z- 1/z. It's fun to play around with the ideas here. 16 �b4 b6 (D) White's whole idea is that Black's pieces are a little loose while his own centre is mobile. Al though Black's queenside passed pawns are typically harmless for the time being, his pieces are protected here and it's been hard for even the world's best players to achieve anything; however, developments will probably continue for many years to come. 17 .tgS Or: a) The revival of 15 ... .tb3 began with 17 d5 �d6! 1 8 .td2?!

Sokolsky Exchange Sacrifice 14 d5!? ilxal 15 �xal Here's another sacrificial idea, again ana lysed in great depth but still affording new op portunities for both sides. Right now the attack on e6 isn't real ( 1 6 dxe6 �xd3), but it will be soon enough. 16 .th6 will come next, so Black nearly always defends g7: 15 . • .f6 (D) White has given up a rook for a bishop. What does he have? First of all, it was Black's dark squared bishop that disappeared in the trade, so Black' s kingside dark squares (and even his central dark squares) have become more vul nerable. The move .. .f6 is weakening. this time of the squares e6 and g6. White also has an im portant lever with the move e5, in order to crack open the long diagonal or at least take over the centre. The g6-pawn can also become a target after e5 and 'bf4. Remember that pieces alone. however ideally placed, won't generally win the game until there is some kind of supporting pawn-break. Furthermore, it' s generally true that possession of the bishop-pair can be enough to compensate for the loss of the exchange until the endgame approaches (and sometimes even thereafter). So there' s no hurry to win back ma terial or even to blast through to the king. With all that, is Black simply lost? Not really. It" s up to White to find a way to break through. which is hard enough, but Black also has poten tial counterplay on the queenside ( ... l:tc8 . ...a6 . ... b5, etc.) and the important defensive/offen sive moves ...e6 and ...e5, which can sometimes neutralize the attack altogether. Those are the basic ideas. Unhappily for the average player, this particular sacrifice requires considerable knowledge and specific memori zation for which there is simply no substitute. Thus I'll give just a single game with one of the variations that seems topical and leave the reader to his own devices (= serious study). 16 �d4 Van Wely - Sutovsky Dortmund 2005 1 6 l::t b l and 16 �bl are also played.

wish to specialize in less volatile lines. Once you've seen enough of the recurrent motifs in this variation you'll understand how to apply them to original positions. In the early days of the Gri.infeld Defence, 7 tl:Bf3 received little attention because it was sup posed that Black could pin the knight with ... .tg4 at some point and nullify its role as pro tector of the centre. But it turns out that White's centre can stay intact in such situations and that ... .tg4 can have some serious drawbacks. Knowing that, White can settle back and enjoy the fact that his knight is more aggressively placed on f3 than e2. There's of course much more going on, as I'll try to indicate as we move along. 7 ...c5 7 ...O-O 8 .te2 only reduces Black's options if he plays 8 ...c5 next. Instead, it makes the most sense to combine 7 ...O-O 8 .te2 with 8 ...b6, because the bishop on e2 would have to move again to protect e4. Then 9 O-O .tb7 10 'iVc2 is a fairly comfortable position for White, who can play moves like .tg5, l::t d l , d5, etc. But Lautier actually assigns 8 ...b6 a ' ? ! ' and I can't resist showing the game Lautier-Miral les, Swiss Cht 1995, with a selection of his notes: 9 h4 ! (D). White's attack is seemingly innocuous, and yet Lautier shows that it's not so easy for Black: a) 9 ... .tb7 10 h5 ! .txe4 1 1 tl:Bg5 .txg2 12 l::t h2 .td5 1 3 hxg6 hxg6 14 'iVd3 and White's at tack is already on the verge of winning. b) Lautier also mentions 9 ... .tg4!? without comment, after which I suspect that he had planned the surprising 10 h5 !, and 10 ...gxh5 1 1 tl:Be5 ! or 1 0. .. .txh5 1 1 e5 !? with quite a good attack. c) The game proceeded 9 ...c5 10 h5 ! �a6 1 1 hxg6 hxg6 12 .th6! .txh6 (12. ...txe2? 13 @xe2! allows White to connect rooks: 1 3. .. .txh6 14 l::t xh6 cxd4 15 cxd4 'iVc8 16 'iVd3 'iVa6 17 l::t ahl with a winning advantage) 13 .l::!. xh6 �g7 14 'iVd2 l::t h8 15 tl:Be5 !

Quite a preny game. After 7 ...c5, the variation that has dominated practice has been 8 .l::!. b 1 . But the flexible bishop development 8 .te3 is also fascinating. tl:Bf3 and .te3 8 .te3 (D) This keeps a lot of White's options open. Now the fl-bishop may still go to c4 or d3 instead of the conventional e2. White might also like to play a quick l::t c l . Finally, it would be great to get 'iVd2 and .th6 in, eliminating White's great est enemy. That isn't likely, but Black needs to react. He normally does so by entering some kind of endgame via ... 'iiV a5 and ... cxd4. but can also play slowly to restrain and ultimately break down White's centre. We'll follow two games.

This move is played in the majority of con temporary games with 7 lLif3.

As always, the battle is between White's large centre and Black's at tempts to immobilize and undermine it. S. Ivanov - Mikhalevski St Petersburg - Beer-Sheva 1 999 12 .l::!. b3 (D) This is a fascinating alternative to the main move 12 �d2. It has the following features: a) It protects the c-pawn; b) It intends to play c4, after which the rook may swing over to the centre or kingside; c) Unlike 12 �d2, it keeps the path of the c l -bishop free. On the negative side: a) The move ...c4 can force the rook to an awkward square with tempo. If it occurs, the rook will want to go to b4, when the move �d2 will be necessary to protect the c-pawn. But that blocks off the c l-bishop anyway! b) Whereas 1 2 �d2 gives extra support to White's attack with f4, the rook on b3 does nothing in the centre.

I'll just point out that it's the same story of White trying to blast through with his central pawns and Black trying to break them up. Wherever the bishop retreats. Black must beware of the white pawn if it reaches d6 and is still well-supported. Some times it takes 20 more moves, but it's a very good bet that you'll see it on d7 !

GRUNFELD DEFENCE 277
what we know. As with most main lines, theo retical analysis has developed over many years and is extremely dense. Therefore I'm going to cover only certain characteristic ideas, basic and otherwise, with little pretence to following the 'best' lines. My concentration is upon the variation that has been Black's favourite solu tion for some time. I shall present more White wins, not only be cause they tend to be more thematic (advance the pawns, sacrifice, etc.), but because at the top levels White has such an overwhelming score after l l ...'ii' xa2 (66%, with very few losses). Nevertheless, my notes indicate Black's possi bilities of equalizing in key lines, so the reader shouldn't be overwhelmed by White's brilliant victories. OK, what is going on in the diagram posi tion? First of all, White has gambited a pawn and he has given Black two connected passed pawns on the queenside. Why? One reason for doing so is simply a practical one: years of ex perience have shown that 1 1 �d2 (in response to 10 ... 'ii' a5+) results in a queenless middlegame (after l l ...�xd2+) in which there are no pros pects for White to win if Black plays even mod erately good moves. As might be expected, Black can even get the advantage in such an ending if White overextends his centre pawns. So with his pawn sacrifice by 1 1 .Bd2, White is trying to win. But upon what basis? First, he has more pieces out. Black's queen's knight and bishop have reasonably good squares to go to when they get out, but the presence of the rook on b l means that at some point Black will have to use a tempo to defend b7. And although the b8-knight can be aggressively developed to c6, it may well be kicked around by d5. A sec ond advantage for White is our favourite one: the ideal Grtinfeld centre. Not only does it re main a great threat to advance, but because of White's faster development it's less likely to be broken up. As indicated above, Black has to watch out for the d-pawn getting to d6. In addi tion, White can make use of the traditional ad vantage of having more space under control. i.e., he has the freedom to shift his pieces more easily from side to side and front to back than Black does. In our games you will see White' s pieces occupying aggressive posts on the fourth and fifth ranks. Other aspects of the position offer food for thought. Black's queen, for example, might seem to be exposed to attack, and in particular to time-gaining attacks that will help White's pieces to better posts. That is sometimes true. but in fact, the queen can also interfere with White's ability to place his pieces where he wants them. Right off you can see that White· s passively-placed bishop would like to go to c4 but can't, and just as importantly, White's queen can't get to c2, b3 or a4. Sometimes those bish ops on d2 and e2 will be targets that prevent White from straying too far. This issue varies from position to position, but it's worth noting how often the retreat of Black's queen (to e6. for example) is advantageous for White. Another subtlety has to do with those passed a- and b-pawns. Often players assume that con nected passed pawns are a cause to panic and that one needs to undertake immediate action against them. However, the pawns here can hardly advance without creating serious weak nesses, and would have to be well up the board before their aggressive potential would out weigh their vulnerability. Nevertheless, all this does point to some positive features of Black's position: he has no weaknesses at the moment and none of his pawns are past the third rank. nor are they likely to be so soon. It is notori ously difficult to break down such a structure: consider, for example, the many variations of the Sicilian Defence which share this character istic. And in the long run the passed a- and b pawns will become of decisive importance, es pecially in a simplified position. A good way to think about White's strategy is in terms of piece placement. You will find
2 78 MASTERING THE CHESS OPENINGS
that White's queen's bishop tends to go to e3, but sometimes to g5 or b4 to harass Black' s e pawn. The other bishop is an opportunist, head ing to c4 if possible, but being quite content on the long diagonal if there is an exchange of Black's bishop on g4 for a knight on f3. White's rook on bl likes to swim around on the fourth rank via b4, and his other rook on fl will often go modestly to e l to protect the e4-pawn, or to d l to help advance the d-pawn. For his part, Black simply needs to develop his pieces safely. His bishop on g7 is ideally placed, and his knight would usually like to at tack White's centre from c6, although ... lLid7- b6 is also played. Obviously, Black's rooks be long on open files, but the one on a8 may stay there in order to support and advance the a pawn. Finally, we have Black's light-squared bishop, which can go to d7 or b7, but in view of White's attack will usually go to g4 in order to exchange off a white piece. The ideas above are only starting points, and you'll need to look at a lot of games in various books to get a deep understanding for how to play these lines.

This is (or seems to be) the most important move because it gets a piece out and indirectly attacks d4.

Various innovations will leave the exam ples that I'm using marginally relevant if that. But I doubt if the nature of the play will be such as to invalidate the basic concepts we shall see. The following is one of the most compli cated and brilliant games in recent years. Again I won't delve into the details (which would fill a pamphlet!) but present a picture of White's space and centre battling Black's passed a-pawn.

This is known as the Russian System. Now the vast majority of games continue as fol lows: 5 . . • dxc4 Black prefers to play actively. 5 ...c6 is a rare al ternative in master play (a sort of Griinfeld/Slav mix with a passive reputation). 6 �xc4 O-O 7 e4 (D)
GRUNFELD DEFENCE 281
This position introduces all main lines of the Russian System. What are its features? First, White has established his ideal centre and the usual free development associated with it. More over he has a fair number of pieces out, and he can quickly bring a rook to d l to shore up the centre after developing his dark-squared bishop. What can be wrong with that? Simply that one of those developed pieces is the queen on c4, and it is subject to attack with loss of time. Moreover, White is still two moves away from castling. Thus Black would like to combine the idea of rapid development with attacking White's centre. He can do this with pawns or pieces. Notice too that White's central majority is inherently more vulnerable than it is in the Exchange Systems, where it is supported by a pawn on c3. Thus White's advantage in space is extremely important so as to keep Black's pieces off aggressive squares. In the face of such restriction, Black needs a set-up which de velops some of his pieces without blocking off the rest. Of the various eligible strategies, I've chosen to examine the Hungarian Variation 7 ...a6 and the traditional 7 ...i.g4, sometimes known as the Smyslov Variation. Among other possibilities, 7 ...c6 doesn't challenge the centre, and Black is unlikely to equalize after the simple 8 �b3 ! with the idea 8 ...b5?! 9 a4!. Black has better moves than 8 ...b5, but White can ignore flank advances and gain a nice lead in development with his centre intact. There are two major alternatives to 7 ...a6 and 7 ...i.g4. The Prins Variation 7 ... lLia6 (D) has been used by many of the great Griinfeld players and has devoted advocates. Why would the knight move to the edge of the board? Simply to support the move ...c5 without getting in the way of Black's other pieces. That applies most obviously to the c8- bishop which would like to go to e6 or g4. bul also to the knight on f6, which will appreciaae having d7 free in case of White's e5. I won'a give any examples, but the situation can be de scribed in general terms. Assuming that ... c5 is played early on, White will usually respond with d5 and it will not surprise the reader that this potentially passed pawn can prove bother some for Black. This d-pawn advance is usually better than dxc5, which invites Black to de velop with tempo by ... .Be6, and can lead to tac tical difficulties. After d5, Black counters with ...e6, and after the exchange of pawns on d5 we have the usual situation of White's passed. iso lated d-pawn trying to advance down the board while Black attempts to render it harmless and work around it. White hopes to tie Black down to defence while he exploits his greater space 10 rush his pieces forward (i.f4 and lLib5 are com mon, to escort the d-pawn if possible, or just aa tack), whereas Black will tend to stay acti ... ·e. Rather than rush to blockade by, say, ... tiJc7- e8-d6, he can play aggressive moves such as ... �b6, ... lLib4, ... i.f5 and ... lLie4 with a coun terattack and/or simplification. The timing of all this is crucial and most authors warn of the degree of memorization that is required to play these lines well. Obviously White needs to be ready for the Prins, and if this description of ideas appeals to you as Black you may wish to take up 7 ... li.Ja6. The ideas are relatively straightforward. and you can probably learn on the job.
282 MASTERING THE CHESS OPENINGS
Finally, the modem line 7 ... t/jc6 (D) is a log ical attack on the centre that entails some risk. It is often combined with ... i.g4. Most players find 7 ... t/jc6 a little hard to be lieve at first, since it walks directly into d5 now or later. That was the conventional wisdom for some years until, armed with computer analy sis, some players decided that a knight on a5 (for that is where it's headed after d5) would be in no great danger, and that its influence over the board will be significant if Black can open the c-file by means of ...c6. Such a modem view of flank knights is not so unusual. Black is say ing: "I don't care where my pieces end up as long as I can break up your centre." Another consideration: Black is giving up the ...c5 break for a while, much as in the 7 ... i.g4 lines. If White isn't provoked to play d5 soon then Black may find himself without a meaningful central pawn-break. One reaction to this situation is to aim for ... t/jd7-b6 (as in the Smyslov Variation below), when apart from ...e5 it may even be possible to use the move ... f5 effectively. Let's briefly examine how the respective strategies can collide: a) Black's idea is shown by lines such as 8 d5? ! t/ja5 9 �c5 c6 ! 10 dxc6 ( 1 0 b4? is beau tifully refuted by 10 ... t/jd7 1 1 �e3 �b6 !)

Black grabbed the seventh rank after 18 t/jd5 .l::!. c2 19 i.d2 t/jec4 and eventually converted his clear advantage into victory in J.Richardson-S.Emst, Lichfield 2000. b) 8 .Bf4!? provokes the sequence 8 ...t/jh5 9 .Be3 .Bg4, when Black aims his forces at d4 and the dark squares in general. Things can get hot after 10 O-O-O i.xf3 1 1 gxf3 e5 !? 12 d5 ! ? (12 dxe5 'ii' h4 13 e6 has to be considered) 12 ... t/jd4 1 3 f4 ! and an aggressive course would be

But this line looks shaky and is the sort of thing that may leave players nervous about 7 ... t/jc6. c) Speaking of which, advocates of 7 ... t/jc6 always said that one of the main points was that White's most natural plan with 8 i.e3 and 9 O-O-O could be ruined by the powerful 8 ... t/jg4, and indeed, 9 O-O-O t/jxe3 10 fxe3 e5 ! 1 1 dxe5 �e8 is at least equal, as is 9 l:!.dl t/jxe3 10 fxe3 e5 ! . But someone noticed that you can change orders by the simple 9 e5 ! (D). For example, 9 ... t/jxe3 !? (9 ... i.e6 10 �c5 a5 { 10 ... t/jxe3 1 1 fxe3 a5? 12 d5 } 1 1 a3 a4 12 i.b5; 9 .. . t/ja5 !? 10 �d5 ! t/jc6 11 i.f4!? t/jb4 1 2 �b3 a5 13 h3 i.e6 14 �dl t/jh6 15 i.e2 fa vours White; these are just typical ideas - if White's basic central advantage goes untouched, Black's pieces usually can't do it on their own) 10 fxe3 a5 (10. .. t/jaS ! ? 1 1 �d5 !? t/jc6! 1 2 i.b5 is another possibility) 1 1 a3 a4 12 .l:i.dl l:!.a5? 1 3 h4 !?

White is win ning. Of course, Black could settle for 8 ... t/jd7 af ter all, abandoning one of the major points of

7 ... CiJc6. This would be a sad but hardly fatal outcome. The Hungarian Variation 7 ...a6 (D) This little move is undoubtedly the most radical way to meet the Russian System. Black intends a direct attack by ...b5 and further dis ruption to regain the centre, ideally by ...c5. If White plays e5 Black can reply ... CiJfd7 followed by moves such as ... CiJb6 and ... ile6 to control the d5- and c4-squares. Against slow moves such as ile2 and ile3, the idea of ... ilb7 and an early ...c5 is typical, even if it involves the sacri fice of the c-pawn. As usual, White would like to advance his central majority. If Black can lure White's pawn to d5 without playing ... c5, how ever, it can be attacked by both ...c6 and ...e6 (which is not the case in the Exchange Varia tion). In fact White will generally prefer e5 to d5. It gains a tempo and is sometimes followed by e6 with an attack. Barr ing that, the e5-pawn still serves to limit the scope of Black's Griinfeld bishop on g7. More than any other Russian Sys tem variation, the Hungarian tends to be forcing, tactical, and aggressive. As is the case with some such lines, I'll use a game and excerpts to illus trate important attacking and defending ideas. 8 �b3 Lautier - Leko Ti/burg 1997 a) As usual there are some move-order is sues to be understood. 8 e5 can be met by 8 ...b5 9 �3, transposing to the main line. However. 8 ...CiJfd7 !? is a serious alternative; for example. 9 ile3 (9 �3 CiJb6 10 ile3 ile6 1 1 �c2 tfJc6

Especially after the slow move 7 ...a6 this would seem to be an excellent option because it develops with tempo. The problem is that Black sacrifices the c pawn, which is customary in this dynamic vari ation: 8 ...b5 ! 9 �xc7 �xc7 10 ilxc7 ilb7 (D). Black's bishops and initiative are quite suffi cient to balance the play if not more. For start ers, Black hits the e-pawn twice and threatens ... b4 as well. Thus: 1 1 e5 (1 1 ild3 b4 12 CiJa4 tfJxe4 and White is saddled with a fairly use less isolated queen's pawn) 1 1 ...CiJd5 12 CiJxd5 ilxd5 1 3 ile2 l:!.c8 14 ilb6 l:!.c2 15 b3 tfJc6 16 ild1 l:!.c3 17 O-O l:!.b8 1 8 ilc5 l:!.d8 (intending ... ilxf3 and ...

284 MASTERING THE CHESS OPENINGS
8 ...b5 Continuing with the move-order discussion, Black can play S ...c5 ! ? ( D) here, which White could have avoided by S e5. White seems to be on top after 9 dxc5 (9 e5 lll g4!) 9 ...�a5?! (9 ... lll bd7 ! 10 c6! bxc6 1 1 ile2 l:.bS 12 �c2 is only slight worse for Black) 10 �b6 �xb6 1 1 cxb6 lt:lbd7 12 ile2 lll xb6 13 ile3 lllbd7 14 lll d4 lllc5 15 f3. This type of po sition arises fairly often in d-pawn play. Black's inferiority in the centre means that he has a hard time finding good squares for all of his pieces. Kasparov-Leko, Frankfurt (rapid) 2000 contin ued 15 ...e5 16 lll c6 bxc6 17 ilxc5 l:.dS 1 S @f2.
9 e5 (D)
By far the most important move. White can play slowly by 9 ile2, but then 9 ...c5 ! 10 dxc5 ilb7 gives good play. 9 a4 c5 ! 10 dxc5 ile6 also shows Black's teeth; e.g., 1 1 �a3 b4 ! 12 �xb4 lll c6 13 �a3 l:.bS 14 ile3 l:.b3, etc.
9. . .
lt:Jfd7 Two alternatives illustrate the aggressive na ture of the play: a) After 9 ... ile6 10 exf6! ilxb3 1 1 fxg7 @xg7 12 axb3 (D), White has only three pieces for a queen and pawn, and he has doubled iso lated b-pawns to boot. Yet he has more than enough compensation because of his better de velopment, bishop-pair, and dark-square pres sure. Several games have proven this, an early one being Bronstein-Poutiainen, Tallinn 1977: l2 ... lll c6 13 ile3 lll b4 14 l:.c l (the doubled b pawns provide an excellent open file) 14 ... �d7 15 ile2 c6 16 llle4 �f5 1 7 lll fd2 llld5 l S O-O �cs 19 lll c5 �c7 20 lll f3 l:.fdS 2 1 lll e5 and White is controlling the queenside. Now Bron stein opens a second front: 21 ... �b6 22 ild2 a5 23 ilf3 l:.acS 24 l:.al l:.aS 25 l:.fcl l:.dcS 26 h4 ! @gs 21 h5 f6 2s lll g4 g5 29 lt:lh6+ @g7 30 lll f5+ @f7 31 h6 ! l:.c7 32 ilh5+ @gs 33 b4 a4 34 l:.el @hS 35 l:.e6 l:.aa7 36 l:.ael (total domi nation) 36 ...�bS 37 g3 �fS 3S ilf3 �f7 39 llld6 �fS 40 ilxd5 cxd5 41 lll xb5 1-0. b) 9 ... lllg4 10 h3 lllh6, attempting to force the dissolution of White's centre, runs into 1 1 ild3 ! lll f5 12 ile4! l:.a7 13 g4! lll h6 (13. .. lll xd4 14 lllxd4 �xd4 15 ile3) 14 ile3 c6 15 O-O-O with a substantial advantage, V.Milov-Svidler, Haifa 1995. In a variation like this in which White has so much space, it's unlikely that the loose squares resulting from a flank advance will hurt him. We now return to 9 ... lllfd7 (D): 10 h4!? Going for broke. Other moves can lead to wild play; for example:

Black's plan is as yet undefined but can consist of a combination of ... lll fd7-b6 and ... lllc6. He has the flexibility of a change of plans if necessary, by, for example, ... lt:lbd7, ...c5 or ...e5. The logic is essentially that the bishop on g4 (usually exchanged on f3) and the knight on c6 combine to put pressure on d4, pressure which is increased when ... lll fd7- b6 unmasks the g7-bishop. Black will some times choose to restrain White's centre by ... e6. Against all this White will normally play d5 at some point. But then we have the ideal under mining situation for Black: as opposed to many other variations in which Black plays ...c5 and White plays d5, here Black has both the c7- and e7-pawns in reserve to challenge the pawn on d5 or at least prevent it from becoming a passed pawn. That's not a bad collection of virtues. What does White have in return? Of course, the cen tre. In this case it's a centre that is reasonably easy to support with pieces and for the mo ment not attacked by any pawns. Furthermore, Black's ... lll fd7-b6 is slow, so White has the luxury of castling queenside or playing l:!.dl , and/or 'wasting' a tempo on h3 in order to fol low up ... ilxf3 with attack on the king side along the open file. Some specifics are also of interest: when Black plays ... lllc6 and ... lll b6, White doesn't always have to retreat but can make the more aggressive move �c5 . All this makes for intriguing play. Now let's explore these ideas by exemplary games:
9 O-O-O
Sosonko - Smejkal Amsterdam 1 979
GRONFELD DEFENCE 287
Castling queenside isn't traditionally the main move here but has always been around and has attracted some attention in recent years. Previously, a majority of players may have felt that White's king was too exposed on c l , par ticularly to pawn and knight attacks on the queenside. Whether that is true or not, the play proceeds along lines that aren't much different from after 9 l:i.dl . 9 .•. lll b6 9 ...lllc6 10 h3 ilxf3 l l gxf3 lll b6 12 °iVc5 f5 yielded double-edged play in the game Smys lov-Botvinnik, Moscow W ch ( 6) 1957. The .. .f5 break is relatively rare because of the weak nesses it creates. But if by threatening .. .f4 Black can force White to exchange on f5, his e-file weakness are a reasonable trade-off for halving White's centre and gaining activity. In the game Botvinnik avoided this by means of 13 lll e2. 10 °iVc5 Now Black can play the thematic 10 ...e5 !?; for example, 1 1 d5 lll8d7 12 °iVa3 l:!.e8 13 @bl a5 14 i.b5 i.f8, Sosonko-Liberzon, Amster dam 1 977. In the game he tries something more interesting: 10 .•. e6 (D) There are several ideas behind this flexible move. The obvious one is to restrain d5. Black also wants to see what White is doing before he commits to ... lll8d7 or ... llla6, and he has the sly idea of ... .l:!.e8 and ... ilf8.

First, White gains opportunities to control important dark squares around the king by means of i.g5 and tt:Je4. Moreover the ad vance ...f6, effective when there's still a pawn on e7, can simply weaken Black's e6, poten tially on an open file following exf6.

c6 Again, a choice: the ... c6/ ...e6 structure is seen here in an almost idealized form, forever preventing d5 and affording one of Black's rooks a nice view of the backward d-pawn. The problem is that Black has no pawn-break, an example of the case where all of one's pieces are well-placed but there's little to do with them. By contrast, Black played dynamically in Hert neck-Bimboim, Munich Z 1987: 15 ... �e7 !?

1 d4 t2Jf6 2 c4 c5 (D)
With this aggressive move Black strikes at the centre with the positional threat of 3 ... cxd4 4 �xd4 tt:Jc6, which would win time by attack ing White's queen. The Benoni is one of very few defences to 1 d4 that counterattacks within the first few moves. Some of its other properties will become clear in a moment. 3 d5 White takes up the challenge and stakes out a large chunk of the centre. This is by far the most common move, and certainly the most interest ing, because it sets up a classic imbalance. In view of move-order issues, it's important to see a few of the alternatives: a) 3 e3 e6 (3 ...cxd4 4 exd4 d5 transposes to a Panov Caro-Kann; 3 ...g6 is also possible) 4 tt:Jc3 d5 (another transposition is 4 ... cxd4 5 exd4 d5 6 tLif3 and again we have a Panov Caro-Kann; refer to Chapter 12 in Volume 1 for an analysis of these positions) 5 t2Jf3 tLic6 is a Semi-Tarrasch Queen's Gambit. b) 3 dxc5 e6 4 tLif3 ilxc5 5 e3 (and not 5 ilg5? tt:Je4! 6 ile3 { 6 ilxd8?? ilxf2#; 6 ilh4?? �xh4! } 6 ... i.xe3 7 fxe3 O-O, when White's pawn-structure is awful and his development retarded) 5 ...O-O 6 tt:Jc3 tt:Jc6 (6 ...b6 7 i.e2 i.b7 is equal) 7 ile2 d5 with equality. This a sort of Queen's Gambit Accepted with colours reversed in which Black has no problems. As is true of so many colours-reversed openings, Black sim ply needs to hold back from playing the ambi tious systems that White is able to get away with when he has a tempo more. c) 3 tLif3 is what most people play if they don't want to go into 3 d5. Then Black can play 3 ... cxd4 4 tt:Jxd4, which is a Symmetrical Eng lish Opening variation. Its theoretical status is quite satisfactory for Black, so most grand masters won't play 3 tLif3 unless they're partic ularly intent upon avoiding risk; however, the move is more popular among non-masters. An other option for Black after 3 tt:Jf3 is 3 ...e6, when 4 tt:Jc3 cxd4 5 tt:Jxd4 is another Symmetri cal English line. The latter can even transpose into the Nimzo-Indian Defence after 5 ... ilb4 (a good move in any case) 6 g3, i.e., 1 d4 tLif6 2 c4 e6 3 tt:Jc3 i.b4 4 tLif3 c5 5 g3 cxd4 6 tt:Jxd4. We now return to 3 d5 (D): 3 . . .e6 This is the move-order associated with the Modem Benoni; it immediately attacks the cen tre. 3 ...e5 followed by ...d6 has been identified by several names, including the Czech Benoni. 3 ...b5 !? is the Benko Gambit, not discussed here. Black can also play 3 ...g6 (or 3 ...d6 4 tLic3 g6) 4 tt:Jc3 ilg7 5 e4 d6 (versus e5), but then it

may be less productive to challenge White' s centre later b y means of . . .e6 for a few reasons, among them the fact that after an eventual ...exd5 White has the additional option exd5. There may also be times at which White's dxe6 is a good move. 4 lllc3 4 lll f3 is an important continuation, although it will usually arrive from the popular move order 1 d4 lllf6 2 c4 e6 3 lllf3 (to avoid the Nimzo-Indian Defence 3 lll c3 ilb4) 3 ...c5 4 d5. That move-order is particularly significant be cause White's choices are limited by the knight on f3, i.e., he can't play popular variations with the moves f4 and f3. See also the discussion of

Wie5) 8 ... O-O 9 e3 .Md8 !?, intending ...d5. The normal and reliable line is 5 ... lllxd5. Then Black equalizes after 6 Wixd5 d6 (or 6 ... lll c6; also, 6 ... i.e7, to meet 7 b3 with 7 ... ilf6, is considered fine for Black) 7 lll f3 lll c6 8 e4 ile6 9 Widl ile7 with equality. White has created the d5 outpost but a piece is a long way from occupying it (llld2-fl -e3-d5) and a piece on d5 might be exchanged anyway. White's rarely-chosen option 5 lllxd5 lllxd5 6 cxd5 (D) is rather instructive: It turns out this particular simplification fa vours Black. White's knight is one of his best
B
pieces and after Black plays ...g6 and ... i.g7 (or ... ile7-f6), the exchange of the f6-knight will give Black' s bishop an open view along the a l-h8 diagonal. Indeed, in the main lines with 5 cxd5 d6 (i.e., without 5 lllxd5 lt:lxd5) Black of ten has to move the knight from f6 to a medio cre square, precisely to increase the bishop's range and in order to hold up e4-e5. 5 ...d6 (D) Black intends to play ...g6 and ... ilg7, but first he stops White's advance d6, and he also opens a diagonal for the c8-bishop. At this junc ture, we'll look at the main moves, 6 e4 and 6 lllf3 (with g3). It's also worthwhile to consider some of the lines involving the move ilf4 as we go along. At this point 6 ilf4 develops quickly and targets Black's weakest pawn on d6. A third-rank pawn that isn't on an open file is nor mally pretty easy to defend, but in the Benoni, Black's can be vulnerable, at least enough to disturb his development. A case in point is 6 ...g6 7 Wia4+!? (the most forcing continuation,
292 MASTERING THE CHESS OPENINGS
but probably not best; White can play into other lines by 7 tt:Jf3 or 7 e4) 7 ... i.d7 8 �3 (D). By attacking the pawn on b7, White is at tempting to force Black to delay his develop ment, since 8 ... ilg7 would lose the d-pawn to 9 ilxd6. Thus Black would like to stay active, and a good way to do that is 8 ...b5 ! (D) (this is a typ ical dynamic pawn sacrifice for development and open lines; the alternative 8 ... °iVc7 9 e4 ilg7 10 tLif3 leads to a main-line position but is not necessarily to everyone's taste as Black). 9 tLixb5 (otherwise Black has expanded on the queenside for free, and remember that ...b5 is the move that Black strives so hard to achieve in the Benoni) 9 ... ilxb5 10 'iVxb5+ t2Jbd7 1 1 °iVd3 (Black was threatening both ... tt:Jxd5 and ... l:.b8) 1 1 . ..°iVb6 1 2 b3 i.g7 1 3 l:.dl O-O 14 t2Jf3; in Hausner-Belaska, Prague 199 1 Black played 14. ..c4?! at this point, but 14. .. l:.fe8 was very strong because of the cute tactic 15 e3?? °iVb4+! followed by ... °iVxf4, winning a piece. Black is able to employ this typical ...b5 sac rifice in similar situations throughout the Ben oni. However, other versions of White playing an early i.f4 were underestimated for years and are quite testing. See, for example, 7 i.f4 in the section that follows. We now move on to White's standard choice on move 6:
6 e4 (D)
Although the move 6 e4 is by no means the only one, White plays it in most games for the obvious reasons of development (allowing the fl-bishop to move) and central control.

g6 Black prepares ... ilg7. At this point we again come to a major fork in the road. We shall look at 7 tt:Jf3, the Classical main line in which White develops normally and without delay; this generally leads to relatively quiet posi tional play. The resulting positions have been debated in more detail than any others in the Modem Benoni. Then we look at the pawn storm systems that follow from the aggressive 7 f4, which itself leads to several distinct attack ing formations. These lines will get their own relatively de tailed sections. I have made that decision based upon the desire to address the most fundamen tal issues inherent in the Benoni without clut tering the presentation. Keep in mind that the Modem Benoni is considerably less popular than the other 1 d4 openings that we deal with in this volume. Nevertheless, there are several other consequential variations that need to be addressed, if only in a selective manner:
MODERN BENONI 293
7 .llf4 is a complex move based upon the bishop's pressure on d6 and e5. Without going into a lot of detail, here are some lines that illus trate both White's development and Black's flexibility: a) 7 ... .llg7 8 'iVa4+ .lld7 9 'iVb3 is a contro versial line that has served White well over the past decade, although with care Black should equalize or come very close to equalizing. b) 7 ...a6 8 lZ'Bf3 b5 (D) and now: bl) 9 .lld3 .llg4! ? - not necessarily best - is an example of Black's strategy to exchange his bishop for a knight in order to reduce White's control over e5.

10 e5 (10 'iVc2 !? O-O 1 1 a4 b4 12 lZ'ibl b3 !? is a
typical Benoni device to ruin the coordination of White's pieces) 10 ... dxe5 1 1 .txe5 lZ'ibd7 12 O-O-O lZ'Bxe5 13 lZ'Bxe5 (D). White's position looks powerful indeed; for example, d6 is threatened. Nevertheless, his kingside pieces are undeveloped, and 13 ... 'iVd6 14 lZ'Bc6 @f8 ! blockades the d-pawn. This re sults in a surprisingly good position because that pawn can be weak and Black has an effec tive queenside majority. Naturally White has a lot of options (the move 9 .td3 above is promis ing), although Black has done well in this varia tion as a whole. Although I won't be examining the 'Modem Main Line' with .lld3 and h3, I'd like to take a quick look at it in terms of pawn-chains. There are numerous orders to get to the basic position; for example, 1 d4 lZ'Bf6 2 c4 c5 3 d5 e6 4 lZ'Bc3 exd5 5 cxd5 d6 6 e4 g6 7 lZ'Bf3 .llg7 8 h3 O-O 9 .lld3 (D). White has the mini-chain e4/d5, and Black has d6/c5. Let's talk about attacking these chains. White would like to get e5 in, attacking the base of the chain. Moves that might assist that are l:tel and .llf4. The alternative f4 is weakening and hard to implement, but not out of the question in the long run. On the queen side, White has the option of b4 to attack the front of the chain, a favourite positional device, most appropriate after Black plays ...b5. For his part, Black can't legally make pawn contact with the front of White's e4/d5 chain, and .. .f5 in such a position tends to be risky (the more so in this particular variation) because of the giant hole created on e6. Grabbing space by 9 . ..a6
294 MASTERING THE CHESS OPENINGS
and ... b5 would be nice but White simply plays 10 a4. Black may therefore feel that he is re stricted to 'counterplay by hook or by crook' , which is why the move most often played is 9 ...b5 !? (D). Black is counting upon the tactic 10 .txb5 lZ'Bxe4 1 1 lZ'Bxe4 �a5+, when 12 lZ'ifd2 �xb5 13 lZ'Bxd6 �a6 gives Black compensation for his pawn, in large part based upon the weakness of White's d-pawn. An extraordinary amount of analysis has been devoted to 9 ...b5. For the re cord, Black needn't be so brash and there are other legitimate ways to approach the position, but this line says something about the nature of the opening as a whole. In many Modem Ben oni variations, Black's main strategy is to hold up White's breaks such as e5 while using his pawn-mass in combination with an open file and powerful g7-bishop to create havoc on the queenside. This is often necessary because in terms of fundamental pawn-structure White has the advantage. Classical Main Line 7 lZ'Bf3 .tg7 (D) We're headed for the older but still worth while main line for White. Since White can get to one of the key positions via the move-order 6 lZ'Bf3 g6 7 lZ'Bd2 .tg7 8 e4 O-O 9 .te2, Black can't easily avoid the whole variation, and he needs to understand the ideas. Here we pause for a discussion of Modem Benoni strategies and themes, many of which apply to the pawn-storm systems (7 f4) as well. You can see right away from the pawn-struc ture that White has more space and that his main pawn-break in most cases will be e5. With the knight on f3, the move f4, which directly supports e5, is unlikely to happen soon; but by utilizing his greater command of territory White can reorganize his pieces so that eventually the e5 advance will be a real problem for Black. This can occur, for example, after .tf4 with l:te 1 , and/or the exotic-but-typical lZ'Bd2-c4. The latter manoeuvre is difficult to answer because it attacks so many key squares like b6, d6, e5, and even a5 (if Black plays ... b5). White can also harass Black with the move .tg5, which can be awkward to answer because Black may be reluctant to weaken himself with ...h6 (al though to be fair, ...h6 is the correct response in most instances). Note that White has a central pawn-majority and, as usual, such a majority tends to assert itself in the long run. Therefore Black will want to upset the equilibrium at a fairly early stage of the game. How is he going to do that? Black has a num ber of plans, but the larger story is that he must attend to the problem of limited space, which in turn means some problems with efficient development. In particular, his bishop on c8 can be a problem piece, even though it is a 'good' bishop. That's for several reasons: a) ... .tf5 is either not on the cards because e4 is already in or will lose a tempo to that move; b) ... .tg4 is sometimes not a good move, losing the bishop-pair. In situations where it would be desirable to exchange off that bishop (the timing can be delicate), White will often play a preemptive h3, denying it access to g4;
MODERN BENONI 295
c) on b7, the bishop will run into White's well-guarded d5-pawn; d) even on d7, it can obstruct Black's devel opmental scheme, in which ... lZ'ibd7 is very of ten involved, and sometimes ... lZ'ifd7 will be desirable to prevent White's e5 advance. The good news for Black is that in any given opening situation, one of those squares tends to be both available and useful. For example, ... .tg4 is played in several main lines in order to release the pressure on e5. After an ex change on f3, it turns out that a combination of knights of d7 and f6 with a rook on e8 and bishop on g7 produces a harmonious set-up in which the knight-pair is often as good as the bishop-pair, and even better in terms of sup porting Black's goals in the centre and on the queenside. And a bishop on d7 can be surpris ingly useful in supporting ...b5 after Black's knight makes a typical journey from a6 to c7. Here's a common picture: Black has been trying to enforce ...b5 and White to prevent it. Now that this advance is imminent, White will often play a5, after which Black can play ... lZ'Bb5 (supported by the bishop on d7), a good move that eyes d4 and even the exchange on c3. Alternatively, after a5, ... .tb5 is sometimes played to contest the c4-square. 8 .te2 O-O 9 O-O (D) We've made a couple more moves. There arises a crucial issue: will Black be able to mo bilize his queenside majority? The move ... b5 is his most likely pawn-break, mainly to prepare ...c4 and/or ... b4, but also giving his pieces some space to work with. The less frequent move ...c4 (by itself, that is, without ...b5) can sometimes provide enough piece-play to compensate for the loss of the important d4-square. Then ... lZ'Bc5 attacks the e-pawn and puts pressure on the in terior weaknesses on d3 and b3 (assuming that White has played a4). Barring either ...b5 or ...c4, Black will suf fer a cramped position on the queenside. Thus White will concentrate his efforts in this area and of course look to e5, with the emphasis de pending upon the specifics of the position. White normally plays a4, which in conjunc tion with his light-squared bishop and knight on c3 is meant to hold down ...b5, at least until White implements his own goals. If White can suppress Black's principal freeing moves, he will have time to organize an attack of his own. Assuming that White has control of the sit uation just described, then Black will have to look to the kingside. Remember that waiting around is usually bad for him since White has the best long-term weapon, the central major ity. The other break against White's pawn chain is . . .f5, difficult to organize because it weakens the interior square e6 so badly. Nev ertheless, Black does succeed in breaking up the centre with ...f5 in a minority of positions, mainly because White's move exf5 will acti vate Black's bishop to f5, from where it can create threats. Finally, Black can try to launch some kind of effective kingside attack by, for example, ...g5-g4 or by some combination of ... lZ'Bh5, ... tt:Je5, . . . .te5, ... tt:Jg4 and/or ... 'iVh4. The latter attack arises surprisingly often be cause White is so concerned with the queen side and moves his pieces in that direction . Thus in the Modem Benoni we are faced with a situation that arises in many d-pawn
296 MASTERING THE CHESS OPENINGS
openings: Black' s flank threats pitted against White's long-term advantages of space and cen tral pawn-structure. From the position after 9 O-O, we'll look at a few games that involve ... lZ'Ba6. In this situation play tends to be entirely on the queenside. Kelecevic - Burgermeister Lenk 2000 9 ... tt:Ja6 This may not be the most accurate move, be cause White can play 10 .tf4 and the knight is perhaps not best-placed on a6. Nevertheless, numerous masters have played 9 ... lZ'Ba6, and this game introduces and illustrates the key ideas of the ... lZ'Ba6 strategy in general. 10 lZ'Bd2 tt:Jc7 11 a4 l:tb8 To begin with, Black aims for ... b5 and White tries to prevent it. 12 f3 White feels that he can prevent ...a6 and ...b5 with a timely lZ'Bc4 and .tf4, sometimes in con junction with a5. Black will have a hard time defending d6 and getting anything at all started on the queenside. 12 ...b6! (D) In response, Black introduces an alternate strategy. His c8-bishop can't find a good square in this position, so he simply trades it off and then expands on the queenside. 13 tt:Jc4 Why does White assent to Black's plan? For one thing, it may be that he will retain the ad vantage by doing so. Furthermore, a slow move like 1 3 @h 1 might encourage Black to return to the standard plan by 13. ..a6 14 lZ'Bc4 b5 15 lZ'Ba5 .td7 with quite an interesting position in which White needs to find a way to proceed. 13 ••• .ta6 White's knight is awfully strong on c4, so it's worth giving up the bishop-pair to get rid of it. 14 .tgS h6?! This has been played in many games, but will lose a critical tempo. See the next game for a similar position in which Black plays ...

Note that this attacks the front of the pawn-chain, a mode of play quite as common as attacking the base. In the mean time, White's queen protects the knight on c3, so all his pieces are safe and Black has no funny tactics along the al -h8 diagonal. 18 ... a6 19 b4! bS 20 axbS axbS 21 .td3 c4 White was threatening the c-pawn. 22 .tc2 (D) Let's take a tally of the opening and early middlegame: White has a space advantage and can use the d4-square for his pieces.

This is a stable variation, marked by ma noeuvring rather than tactics. As in the last game, Black is aiming for ...b5 via the moves ... lZ'Bc7, ... l:tb8 and ...a6 in some order. If White plays a4-a5, the knight on c7 may move to b5, exerting influence over d4 and c3. By playing

.tf4, and perhaps e5. He has an advantage in space and freer pieces, so he hopes that the re sulting positions will force Black on the defen sive. Neither side is consumed by the kind of tactics that characterize many main-line Benoni variations, so the underlying clash of ideas will be apparent throughout the opening stage.
11 f3 t:Dc7 12 a4 b6
Again, this is the distinguishing move. Pre paring ...b5 by ...a6 would allow t:Dc4 and .tf4, attacking d6, and let White invade on b6 (per haps with a5 first). To preface this with ... l:tb8 and ... b6 is slow and invites the move .tf4 fol lowed by e5, when the bishop on f4 strikes at the core of Black's position, through to c7 and b8. Therefore, as above, Black switches to the idea of a quick ... .ta6, both to get rid of the bishop that he can't use and to eliminate White's powerful knight. Of course this costs time and the bishop-pair, so a kind of positional balance results. We follow two games: Beliavsky - Portisch Szirak IZ 1987 13 t:Dc4 .ta6 14 .tgS Wfd7! (D) Black avoids ...h6, which only gives White a target. 15 l:tbl .txc4 16 .txc4 a6 17 b4 This is White's standard idea that we ex plained above; its purpose is to immobilize Black's pawns.
17. ..bS 18 .td3
18 axb5 axb5 would open the a-file for Black, who could fight for the initiative by ... l:ta3. Then the unprotected state of the knight on c3 makes it impossible to contest the a-file by l:tal , so Black could double or triple pieces on it.
18. .. c4 19 .tc2
Here White has achieved his goal of limiting Black's pawn advance. As in the last game, his bishop on c2 is as bad as Black's knight on c7. The difference is that the latter piece isn't stuck where it is, and White's knight on c3 is unpro tected. 19 ... bxa4! (D) This is a common theme: if Black can't win the a-file (in the case where White plays axb5), then he can often play ...bxa4 himself and win the b5-square for his knight on c7. 20 .txa4 Instead, 20 t:Dxa4 ! ? l:tab8 covers b6. There might follow 2 1 t:Dc3 t:Db5 22 t:Dxb5 axb5 23 .te3 l:ta8 24 .td4 W/c7 (24 ... t:Dh5 25 .txg7 @xg7 26 Wf d4+ f6 and ... l:ta2 is also good) 25 l:tal lDd7, when Black's knight is better than White's light-squared bishop; for example, 26

This kind of pawn-structure will often fa vour White if Black still has his light-squared bishop (on d7, for example). But here Black has no such bad pieces and he does have key advan tages: he controls the a-file, has great pressure down the long diagonal, and his c-pawn has the potential to be mobile if White needs to rear range his pieces in defence. 23 ii.e3 Black's g7-bishop finally shows its stuff af ter 23 'iVd2 l:ta3 24 i.e3 l:txc3 ! 2S 'iVxc3 lZ'Bxe4 26 'iVa3 4'1c3 27 l:tbel lZ'ixdS with two passed pawns for the exchange.

White's pawn on b4 is a target and he is vulnerable to the break ... fS because after exfS his d-pawn will need tending. Those factors wouldn't be decisive but the passed c-pawn's power has grown with simplification. 28 'iVc3 a) After 28 'iVxa7 l:txa7, Black not only con trols the a-file but has ... fS as a break in order to weaken White's e-pawn (after ...fxe4) or reach the seventh rank (after exfS). b) The same trick works in seemingly less fa vourable circumstances following 28 'iVf6 'iVe7 29 'iVc3 'iVeS ! ?

7 f4 (D)
This move defines the basic starting posi tion for pawn-storm variations. Like other In dian systems that permit White to construct a large centre, a fundamental test of the Benoni is whether White's centre pawns can be used sim ply to roll over Black's position or at least cramp him beyond acceptable bounds. For ex ample, the King's Indian Defence essentially passes this test when confronted with the Four Pawns Attack. The Griinfeld Defence holds up well if, having established a d4/e4 centre, White plunges ahead with f4. In the Samisch Nimzo Indian, and in the 4 'iVc2 O-O 5 e4 variation, Black can defend against the blind advance of White's centre (with great care, to be sure). For all of these defences we find that White's ultra ambitious play can produce no more than dy namic equality. But interestingly, the Modem
302 MASTERING THE CHESS OPENINGS
Benoni has real difficulties with White' s most primitive attacks via e4 and f4. We can ascribe this to various reasons, one of which is his de lay in castling. In the King's Indian, Black tends to castle on move 5, and in the Nimzo Indian as early as move 4. In the Benoni, not only is Black unprepared to castle until move 8, but his king can be subject to harassment in some lines. 7 ...�g7 (D) From this position, we're going to look at the Mikenas Attack, 8 e5, and the Taimanov At tack, 8 �b5+. 8 lZ'Bf3 is the Four Pawns Attack of the King's Indian Defence; see that chapter. However, with this move-order Black is com mitted to a ...c5-based approach, and doesn't have option of an early ... tt:Ja6 (and ... e5) as he did in the King's Indian Defence. The Mikenas Attack 8 eS (D) In the days when the Modem Benoni first gathered a steady following, this radical ad vance was used regularly. It comes very close to blowing Black's position apart. By investigat ing why it fails to do so, we can understand why the Benoni is possible at all. 8 ... tt:Jfd7 Bozinovic - Cebalo Pula 2002 Black thinks that White's centre is overex tended and takes care not to open things up.

Having drawn the knight back to d7, White can return to a Four Pawns Attack set-up by 9 i.e2 (9 i.d3 is also possible; note that both 9 i.e2 and 9 i.d3 run away from Black' s planned ...a6 and ...b5 so that ...a6 can now be met by a4, quashing any notion of ...b5 for a long time to come) 9 ... O-O 10 lllf3. Whether this is advanta geous or disadvantageous is unclear, because a knight on d7 serves a prophylactic function versus e5 but doesn't attack the centre. You should definitely consult the King' s Indian chapter in order to understand this one. Typical Benoni moves might follow, such as ... .l:!.e8, ...llla6-c7, ...a6, ....l:!.b8, etc., with ... b5 as the goal. White plays for the e5 break, typically prepared by moves such as a4, .l:!.el , i.fl and h3.

For a similar idea, see 9 ... O-O 10 lllf3 llla6 above. 10 lll f3 lllb4!? 11 O-O a6? This move just doesn't work out due to an unexpected idea by Kasparov. 1 1 ...O-O is the natural alternative, though then White has time to provide the fl -square as a convenient spot for his bishop to drop back to when hit by ...a6. 12 .Bxd7+! .Bxd7 13 f5! (D) It's surprising but logical (with hindsight!) to give up the bishop-pair, because White gives up his bad bishop while extending the range of his good one. In the meantime, although the knight on b4 hits some good internal squares, it doesn't manage to return to the centre, from where it would protect his kingside.

This short game contains re markably many positional and tactical themes. The Queen Check Variation 9 ... �h4+ This check has become one of Black's most popular moves. 9 ...a6 is often played in order to see where the bishop is going before decid ing upon the desired set-up. That's a technical move-order issue, however, and we want to get a feel for the broader ideas. In this section some of the games actually transposed from 9 ...a6.
10 g3 �d8 (D)
10 ...�e7 is also frequently played, just as it is in the lines 9 .Be2 �h4+ and 9 .Bd3 �h4+. From e7 the queen puts direct pressure on e4 but is somewhat more vulnerable to the e5 ad vance, because ...dxe5 might be answered by d6.
MODERN BENONI 307
Black has had fair success from this position and similar ones with ...a6 in. What on earth is going on? He sacrifices two tempi to provoke the little move g3. This has several ideas behind it: a) First, it asks White exactly what his plan is if Black doesn't expose his pieces to direct at tack. Often the answer to that question in other lines is the manoeuvre i.d2-el -h4 (or i.g3), but that is eliminated here. b) The move g3 weakens White's kingside pawn-structure. c) Black's light-squared bishop, his main problem in this variation, now has good chances to get to g4 (or h3). Once that occurs he can play ... i.xf3 and neutralize White's threat to advance by e5. White can only stop ... i.g4 by further weakening himself. Or so the theory goes. Of course, White isn't crying over his fate and is glad to get the oppor tunity to use two extra tempi productively - es pecially in an attacking position ! 1 1 l2Jf3 O-O 12 O-O a6 ( D) Now there are various bishop retreats. I'll give some sample games. Van Beek - Gofshtein Tel Aviv 2001 13 i.e2 .l:!.e8 14 @g2! Covering h3 against intrusion by a black bishop.

310 MASTERING THE CHESS OPENINGS
We haven't examined many fianchetto lines versus Indian systems in this book. With this variation we have a solid approach that de fends d5, and to all appearances doesn't do much else. Of course that's not so. In the initial stages of the game, White proceeds along the principle of prophylaxis to counter Black's normal plans. Then he patiently reorganizes, implementing his own strategy of piece-play versus d6 and eventual expansion in the centre. This usually involves the manoeuvre llld2-c4, possibly in conjunction with .lli. f4. Of a sudden Black can be helpless against the threats, fre quently created by a delayed e4-e5. Remem ber that a central majority is often the last thing to be mobilized, but then it can prove deadly! On the flip side, White's bishop on g2 runs right into its own pawn on d5. Furthermore, Black's efforts to realize ...b5 and ...c4 benefit from the absence of the bishop from the fl -a6 diagonal. His most popular plan involves ...a6 and ... lll bd7 and, once White's knight gets to c4, he can play ... lll b6 or ... lll e5 to challenge it. There's also nothing wrong with ... llla6-c7 as long as Black is careful to watch the tactics. Finally, before White reorganizes his pieces Black can play for ... .l:!.e8 and ... lll e4. All this should be done as quickly as possible before White's pawns assert themselves. If White can fend off short-term threats, as he often can, he will normally remain with some advantage. Let's see games using these ideas. Play Down the e-File
