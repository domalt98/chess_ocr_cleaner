PREFACE
My desire in writing this new edition of 1be Amateur's Mind is to supply tools to the average player that will enable him or her to improve dramatically. Though the general base of the original book still exists, I've simplified the language when I deemed it necessary. The book's layout has been redesigned now it's easier to pick out the key points and assimilate the material presented. Most importantly, I've added twenty-six tests at the end of the book. The answers to these tests, all deep and instruction rich, add more than one hundred pages of highly useful information. The addition of a glossary allows the puzzled student quick and easy access to chess terms, strategies, and concepts. I'm convinced that this original material, combined with the improvements outlined above, will turn any serious student of the game into a strong tournament player. Jeremy Silman April 1999
INTRODUCTION
Every chess student dreams of finding the perfect teacher someone who magically knows what's going on in the student's mind and is able to surgically remove the flaws contained there. Unfortunately, this rarely happens in reality. The well-meaning master, not being a movie character or a psychic, thinks it sufficient to look at the student's games, ask questions and give pat answers to the problems that appear before his eyes. While this is a good technique, I often wondered what would happen if a teacher could really get inside the student's head. To accomplish this, I played games with my students (always starting them off with a good position), had them talk out loud before they made a move and after I made mine, and wrote down their thoughts. To my amazement, I was soon seeing problems that I never imagined they possessed. To add to this, I also had them annotate a series of Grandmas ter games. Their responses to the Grandmaster's moves and plans showed me which concepts they were able to understand and which ones were absent from their make-up. The Amateur's Mind is the result of these sessions. It is a road map of typical thinking errors that turn out to be reflections of your own thoughts as much as they are the thoughts of the people that originally shared them with me. Within these pages you will find much of interest: easy-to understand rules and recommendations, new strategies, surpris ing insights-ail designed to help you eradicate the "chessic" doubts and fears that reside within you. Study this information carefully and spend some •time thinking about it. Hopefully, it will be your first step in turning the chess misconceptions that you've owned for so long into the chess mastery that you have always dreamed of attaining.

IMBALANCES
The heart of my system of training is based on an understanding of the dynamic and static differences (known as imbalances) that exist in every position. By recognizing the different imbalances in a given situation, a player of virtually any strength can understand what his responsibilities are towards that position with relative ease. Note that I used the word "responsibilities." A player can't do anything he wishes to d�. For example, if you love to attack, you can't go after the enemy King in any and all situations. Instead, you have to learn to read the board and obey its dictates. If the board wants you to attack the King, then attack it. If the board wants you to play in a quiet positional vein, then you must follow that advice to the letter. To illustrate this concept, let's take a look at the position in diagram 1.
2 I THE AMATEUR'S MIND
(1) Dzindzichashvili-Yermolinsky, U.S. Championship 1993 White to play Wfot is going on here? Most players would either look at the position in a misty stupor or calculate move after move without really knowing what the respective plans are. However, an acquain tance with the list of imbalances would make things much easier. List o f Imbalan ces >- Minor Pieces - the interplay between Bishops and Knights (trying to make one superior to the other). >- Pawn Structure - a broad subject that encompasses doubled pawns, isolated pawns, backward pawns, passed pawns, etc. >- Space - the annexation of territory on a chess board. >- Material - owning pieces of greater value than the opponent's. >- Files and squares - files, ranks, and diagonals act as pathways for your pieces, while squares act as homes. Whole plans can center around the domination of a file, or the creation of a weak square in the enemy camp . >- Development - a lead in development gives you more force in a specific area of the board. This is a temporary imbalance because the opponent will even tually catch up.
IMBALANCES I J
> Initiative - dictating the tempo of a game. This is also a temporary imbalance. A complete explanation of these factors (and a detailed system of planning) can be found in my book, How to Reassess Your Chess--Third Edition. However, a "planning shortcut" can be created by learning to recognize the imbalances for both sides. Once you can do this, simply list the imbalances you're hoping to utilize and strive to make them better than the imbalances your opponent will be using. This brings us back to the earlier discussion of "reading the board. " Can you "read" the position in diagram 1? Before you get carried away, let me remind you: DON'T look at individual moves! In fact, never calculate until you understand the basic components (imbalances) of the position. With this in mind, it's time for you to list all the imbalances you can find. Write this information down and then compare your work with the positional explanation that follows. Imbalances in diagram 1 > Minor Pieces: Black owns two Bishops. The position is fairly open, and this makes us believe that the Bishops will prove superior to the White Knights. > Pawn Structure: Black has no weaknesses in his pawn structure. The only pawn that can be looked upon as potentially weak is the unit on e5. > Space: White has a spatial plus in the center thanks to his advanced e5-pawn. > Material: Material is even. ' > Files and squares: The d-file is open, but neither side has managed to occupy it with a Rook. The f6-square is potentially weak. > Development: White has a lead in development. > Initiative: It's not clear who, if anyone, has the initiative.
4 I T H E A MAT E U R' S MI N D
Did you find the imbalances? If you were a bit off, don't let it bother you. Like anything else, it takes practice. Keep searching for imbalances in every position you see and, in a very short time, you'll be adept at picking out every imbalance in any situation. Now let's combine the imbalances from diagram 1 and see if a plan suggests itself. Black owns two Bishops and is also exerting some pressure against White's pawn on e5. Black would love to increase this pressure and make use of the fact that he owns a dark-squared Bishop while White doesn't. White would like to make his Knights active (Knights need advanced posts if they are going to win a battle against Bishops). Two squares that call out to the horses are e4 and f6. White would like to place a Knight on e4 and then (somehow) bash it into the hole on f6. The problem for White is that using e4 as a post blocks the e-file ·and makes e5 harder to defend. White's extra central space, given to him by the e5-pawn, won't prove very useful because he will be too busy defending e5. That leaves us contemplating White's lead in development (will it give him an initiative?). In the present situation Black will be able to castle quickly and the absence of any weakness will make it impossible for White to profit from this temporary plus. The goals of both sides should now be clear: White must defend his e5-pawn and find a way to advance his Knights and make them active. Black will play to keep the enemy Knights at bay (Steinitz said that the way to beat Knights is to take away all their advanced support points) and to tie White's pieces down to the defense of e5. Since Black threatens to place his pieces on ideal squares by . . .Bc6 (eyeing f3, one of the defenders of e5) followed by . . . Nd7 (attacking e5), White lashes out in an effort to prevent Black from carrying out his ideas.
1.Nb5
This places the Knight on an active square and attacks c7. Now
1.. . Na6 would show that Black has lost sight of his goal (putting
pressure on eS)-a Knight on a6 would no longer be able to go after the White pawn. Not wanting to be distracted from his desires against e5, Black simply takes the Knight (selling his two Bishops for a gain in time) and ends White's threats once and for all. 1 ... Bxb51
2.Bxb5+ c6

This creates a hole on d6, but White's Knight will be so busy defending e5 that it will never be able to maneuver to this newly created hole.
3.Bc4 Nd7
White hasn't been able to make a dent in the Black position while the second player is still calmly following his original plan (taking aim at e5).
4.Qd4 Qc51
Many people don't like to trade Queens too early; they feel it is a wimpy thing to do. However, Black realizes that his goal is not to attack the enemy King. Nor does it have anything to do with other things that might require the retention of the Queens. By swapping the ladies, Black insures the safety of his own King and gets rid of a White piece that could defend e5.

Another point of Black's 1 . . . BxbS can now be seen. By creating Bishops of opposite colors, Black is able to attack e5 with his dark-squared Bishop while White is unable to use his light squared Bishop for defense. IO.Rel Trading on d8 would leave White helpless to prevent (after 10 . . . Kxd8) . . .Nd7 followed by the win of the e5-pawn.

An irate subscriber accused me of offering inappropriate information to the readership. He complained that "weak" players in the "E" to "B" categories are not able to understand subtle things about minor pieces and weak pawns, adding that they can hardly see a mate in one! I think this is completely untrue. After giving a student the basic mating patterns and strategies, you must begin feeding him advanced concepts. At first these ideas will not make sense; many players will have a vague idea of what you are talking about but nothing more. However, even a fragmented understanding of these concepts will prove useful, and eventually they will experi ence a marked increase in strength as these lessons are assimilated by repetition and example. To prove this statement, let's allow a six-year old girl to open our eyes. When she was taking lessons from me, her rating was in the 900 range. I would go through her tournament games, offer advice, and occasionally throw her concepts that would seem to be for much older and more sophisticated players. One day we were looking at a game she had played when I noticed that she had reached a complicated Rook and pawn endgame. To my delight, she moved her Rook to the seventh rank and began taking
IMBALANCES I 7
her opponent's pawns. "Rooks are strong on the seventh rank!" she said. A little while later she moved it away from the seventh. "Why did you retreat your Rook?" I asked. Looking at me like I was an idiot, she answered, "I'm putting it behind my opponent's passed pawn before it becomes danger ous. Rooks should always be placed behind passed pawns!" Let the gentleman who wrote me that letter take note. If a six year old girl can make use of such advanced concepts, then why can't adults with much higher ratings do the same?
THE BATTLE
BETWEEN
BISHOPS AND
KNIGHTS
The seemingly insignificant difference between Bishops and Knights is actually one of the most important imbalances on the chessboard. What gives the Bishop versus Knight battle even more weight is the fact that mos t players are entirely oblivious to it, thereby handing a student of the imbalances a huge advantage. Rules of the Min o r Pieces Rules concerning the war between minor pieces are easy to understand and learn. In fact, you should thoroughly familiarize yourself with them: RULE 1 - Bishops and Knights are both worth three points (as far as point count is concerned).
lO I T H E A MATEU R ' S M I N D
It's up to you to manipulate the position and make whatever piece you own more valuable. Occasionally a book will assign a value of 31/2 points for the Bishop and only 3 for the Knight. Don't buy into this! Either piece is capable of beating the other-it all depends on what you do with them and what you do with the other factors in the position that will influence them. (2) White to play A book can claim that a Bishop is superior to a Knight until the cows come home, but a glance at the diagram will convince anyone of the Black Knight's vast superiority. Though White is a pawn up and has the move, he might as well resign:
1.Kcl Kal
2.Kdl Kb2 and Black wins the c-pawn and quickly turns his
own c-pawn into a Queen. Once again: Bishops and Knights start out as equals. You are the one who will ultimately prove their true value. RULE 2 - Bishops are best in open positions where pawns don't block their diagonals. As a position opens up (i.e., the center pawns get traded), it becomes more and more likely that Bishops will be valued more highly than Knights. For example, the type of central situation
T H E B ATTL E B E T W E E N B I S H O P S A N D K N I G H T S I ll
that comes about after 1.e4 e5 2.d4 exd4 3.c3 dxc3 4.Bc4 cxb2
5.Bxb2 graphically illustrates the board-sweeping power that
Bishops can possess. Those wide open diagonals allow the Bishops to reach their full potential. RULE 3 -Bishops are very strong in endgames where both sides have passed pawns that are dash ing to their respective queening squares. In such situations, the long-range capabilities of a Bishop make it far superior to the slow, short-range Knight. (3) White to play This position is way over the top but it illustrates Rule 3 extremely well. White is four pawns up, his h-pawn is more advanced than Black's a-pawn and, to top it off, White also gets to make the first move. Nevertheless, White is dead lost! Black's Bishop on b2, though far from the vicinity of White's pawns, shows its long-range mastery by stopping all of the enemy passers in their tracks. In the meantime, the lone Black pawn on a3 cannot be stopped because the ponderous Knight is unable to get over to the queenside in time. RULE 4-The term "bad Bishop" means that your Bishop is situated on the same color as your center pawns (which block it and limit its activity). If you have such a Bishop you usually want to do one of three things:
l2 I THE AMATEUR'S MIND
>- Trade It for a piece of equal value . . ...Get the pawns off the color of your Bishop. >- Get the Bishop outside the pawn chain. It will still be bad by definition, but it will also be active. A bad Bishop can be a strong piece! (4) White's Bishop on c4 is "bad" but "active" since it resides outside the pawn chain. Even though it has the stigma of "bad" assigned to it, it is still a very strong piece. If it stood on e2 it would be very inactive and fully deserving of the name "bad." The Black Bishop on c6 is considered to be a "good" Bishop but it is not nearly as "active" as its White counterpart. This example shows us that the terms "good" and "bad" are useful for basic definition, but don't take them too literally! In general, if your Bishop is serving a useful function you can happily toss the "good" and "bad" terminology out the window. RULE 5 - A Bishop's weakness is that it is stuck on one color for the whole game; anything resting on the other color is safe from its attention. Two Bishops work together very well because they control both colored diagonals, thereby negating this "one color" weakness.
T H E B A T T L E B E T W E E N B I S H O P S A N D K N I G H T S I J.3
(5) White to play White is two pawns ahead in diagram 5 but he can't win because his Bishop is useless; it's not capable of chasing the Black King away from e5 or f6 and it can't help the White pawns advance. Give White another Bishop on el and Black another on d7 (creating a two Bishops versus two Bishops situation) and we will see a different result. Now both colors can be controlled and
1.Bh4+ Kg7 2.e5 sets the pawns in motion.
(6) White to play, but Black's Knight dominates the game. RULE 6- Knights love closed positions with locked pawns. Their ability to jump over other pieces makes them very valuable in such situations.
14 / T H E A M A T EUR' S M I N D
In diagram 6, Black's Knight is strongly posted on cS where it is safe from attack. It also eyes the enemy pawns on b3 and e4. White's Bishop is hampered by all the center pawns which block it and make it a passive piece. RULE 7 - Knights usuall of the board. One old y stand better in the center on the rim is dim." chess adage goes: "A Knight There are two reasons for this: The first is that a Knight on one side's rim must make several moves to reach an endangered area on the other wing. A Knight in the middle can jump to either side at will . The other reason for this distrust of the rim is that a Knight simply controls fewer squares there. (7) In diagram 7, the Knight on a2 only controls three squares (b4, c3, cl) and must make three moves to reach the kingside. The central Knight on d6 controls eight squares and can reach either wing in one hop. RULE B - Since Knights are not long-range pieces, they need to have secure, advanced homes to be effective. These homes are call ed support points. In diagram 6, the Black Knight rested on the c5 support point. Other possible support points (if the Knight could reach them) would be c3 and d4. Note that a square like f4 is not a support point since White could easily chase an intruding Knight away by
T H E B AT T LE B E T W E E N B I S H O PS A N D K N I G H T S I 15
g2-g3. In general, a Knight would like to find itself as far up the board as possible.The following points could prove useful: > Knights are not effective on the first rank. Here they act in a purely defensive role. > A Knight stuck on the second rank is also defen sive, and is considered to be inferior to a Bishop. > A Knight on the third rank serves many defen sive functions and is ready to jump further up the board at a moment's notice. > A Knight securely placed on the fourth rank is considered to be fully equal to a Bishop. > A Knight on the fifth is a powerful attacking unit and is usually stronger than a Bishop. > A Knight reaches the zenith of its potential on the sixth rank. Here it eats most other pieces alive and the defender is often happy to sacrifice a Rook for the offending horse and the pawn that protected it. > A Knight on the last two ranks offers diminish ing returns since it does not control as many squares as it does on the sixth. (8) Knight on the 6'h is better than a Knight on the 7rh. In diagram 8, the Knight on c3 attacks eight squares deep in the enemy camp. The Knight on c2 only controls six squares. This
16 I T H E AMATE UR'S MIND
shows how a Knight loses some of its powers once it passes the sixth rank. RULE 9 - Knights are superior to Bishops in an endgame if allthe pawns are on one side of the board. Th.is is because the Bishop's long-range powers no longer have meaning while the Knight's ability to go to either color square means that there is no safe haven for the enemy King or pawns. This is illustrated in diagram 9. (9) White to play, Black wins. The White Bishop cannot come into contract with the Black King, Knight or pawns. In the meantime, the White pawns on e4 and h3 are vulnerable to the combined attack of the enemy King and Knight. RULE 10 - The first official World Chess Cham pion, Wilhehn Steinitz, pioneered work on the minor pieces. He stated that the way to beat Knights was to deprive them of any advanced support points. Then they would be inactive and, as a result, inferior to Bishops. The reverse, of course, is that if you possess Knights, you must strive as hard as you can to create support points for them. • • • • •

Now that we've examined the correct rules for a Bishop versus Knight battle, it's time to see how an amateur puts these bits of wisdom into actual practice. As will quickly become apparent, having access to this knowledge is one thing, actually using it in an over the board struggle is quite another! The first position that we will consider in-depth came about after the moves l.d4 Nf6 2.c4 e6 3.g3 d5 4.Bg2 dxc4 5.Qa4+ Bd7 6.Qxc4 Bc6 7.Nf3 Bd5 8.Qd3 Be4 9.Qdl c5 10.Nc3 Bc6

O-O 16.e4 Qe7 17.Qe2 Bxd4 18.Rxd4 e5 19.Rdl Nb6. This led to the position in diagram 10. (10) Silman-Gross, American Open 1992. White to play. What's going on in this seemingly boring position? The pawn structure is more or less symmetrical, nobody can lay claim to any space advantage, all the pieces are well-defended and neither King is in any trouble. Aside from the fact that White's pieces are more aggressively posted since they are trying to take control of d5 (while Black's Knights are passively trying to defend that square), the one major imbalance is a minor piece difference: White has a Bishop and Knight while Black is stuck with two Knights. Due to the stated imbalances, White will use Steinitz's rule (to make Knights ineffective by taking away their advanced support points). He will do this by restricting the b6-Knight by b2-b3 (if
l& I THE AMATEUR'S MIND
necessary) followed by a2-a4-a5 (kicking it from its perch on b6). He will also place the B ishop on the flexible e3-square and move his Queen to b5 where it eyes the pawns on b7 and e5. All these things may seem small in themselves, but together they add up to unpleasant pressure on the Black position.

Black's case is hopeless. For example, 31 . . .Ra8 32.RxdS! cxd5

How would an amateur handle White's position from diagram 10? Would a student of mine, trained to recognize the imbalances that exist in any position, see and make use of them, or would he miss everything and just look at random moves? This question interested me, so I asked some of my students to take the White pieces and do their best to "show their stuff." They were told to think out loud, which enabled me to write down their thoughts and see just what, if anything, was wrong with their methods of thinking. Of course, I didn't expect my students to play as I did in the Silman-Gross game. White's play was rather subtle and is not something that a class player would ordinarily come up with. However, I did hope that they would notice the Bishop versus Knight imbalance and try to make something of it. Instead, I found that my students (with one exception), after noting that this imbalance was present, refused to try to turn it into some thing significant. Why? Does the average tournament player think that a simple Bishop versus Knight difference is very little to work with? Do they think that such things are unimportant (even though I constantly tell them that Bishop versus Knight is ex tremely important)? Let's see if the following games can shed some light on these questions.
20 I THE AMATEUR'S MIND
(11) 1000-Silman. White to play. 1000: "White's King is a bit open so I prefer Black's position. Black's e-pawn is potentially weak, though. The main imbalance is Bishop versus Knight and, at the moment, I have control of a file. I would now like to develop my pieces . I'd like to get my Knight to d5, so Bg5 gives me more control of that post. However, his b6-Knight also controls d5 and I don't know if I really want to give up my dark squared Bishop: Maybe a3 followed by b4 and Bb2 is good since that adds new pressure against e5." In our next two games, both White players will not question giving up their Bishop for the enemy Knight. 1 000 deserves praise for thinking that his Bishop should be retained. Unfortu nately, the plan he does come up with is bad because it fails to use the Steinitz rule (take squares away from Knights). Instead, he gives the inactive b6-Knight a wonderful post on c4! Also note his fear concerning the position of the White King. In fact, this fear was so pronounced that he immediately pre ferred his opponent's position! Amateurs tend to panic in the face of any hint of a kingside threat, and his comments show that he suffers from the same "King-safety" disease. King safety is very important! But only worry if the enemy has some pieces aimed in your King's direction. In the present position, the only pieces Black has on the kingside are his f6- Knight and the e7-Queen; this can hardly be construed as a horde of attackers!
T H E BATTLE B E T W E E N B I S H O P S AND K N I G H T S I 2 1
A little less worry about his King and a lot more interest in the Bishop versus Knight battle (in other words: pay attention to those imbalances!) would have served him much better. l.a3 Though this was move 20 in the Silman-Gross game, 1000 was given this position cold turkey; for him, it was move one. 1 ... Rfd8 1000: 'Tm not terribly worried about the trade so I'll keep going with my plan."
2.b4 R:xdl
1000: "I don't want to move my Knight backwards so my next move is forced."
3.Qxdl Rc8
1000: "With Qf3 I advance and defend both e4 and c3." He hasn't noticed that Black is jumping on the c4-square. A player should always avoid creating holes in his own position. If he put energy into the Bishop versus Knight battle (which he clearly didn't do) he would have, in theory, been aware of the potential of the enemy Knights. By thinking of other (less impor tant) things, he failed to get the most out of his Bishop and he failed to restrain the enemy horses.
4.Qf3 Qc7
1000: "I will guard the Knight and free my Rook." Something subtle and deadly has occurred. Did you notice it? Poor 1000 has ceased to think of his own ideas and is instead reacting to his opponent's. At first he noted the basic imbalances, and he even came up with a plan (not a good one, but a plan nonetheless). But he failed to ask what Black should try to do, and by failing to pose that important question, he failed to see the weaknesses in his own ideas. thus his plan of placing the Bishop on b2 via a2-a3 and b2-b4 led to a hole on c4. Simultaneously, after he followed his plan for a move or two he suddenly began (not consciously) to bow to the wishes of his opponent. Black makes a threat, White reacts. Black makes

another threat, and once again White reacts. Soon, before he knows it, Black's ideas come to fruition while White's are no where to be seen.

I can go to cl and get ready for a fork or a skewer. Unfortunately, that would bang my a3-pawn. I'll play h4 and hope to chase his Knight on f6 away with a later g4-g5. Then the d5-square might become available." Unable to find a solution to his problems on the queenside, he lashes out on the other side of the board. Emotional decisions like this must be avoided, since they usually have very little to do with what's really happening in the position.

Note how White is coming up with all kinds of esoteric rubbish to explain his opponent's moves. He should be able to figure out their true significance by working out their relationship to the positive imbalances in Black's position. Here Black is simply defending the bS and dS squares and putting more pressure on the e4-pawn. I'm also giving my Queen the option of going to e6 in some circumstances. Amateurs often think that a good move must involve a direct threat However, this is way off the mark. A move that tightens some key points while placing pressure on an enemy pawn deserves a lot more respect than White gave it.

I hope the reader won't think me overly harsh for my comments in this game. I am not criticizing the man, just the player and his erroneous thinking processes. He does some things extremely well, but if he wants to advance in the rating system he will have to accept my literary lashings and iron out these problems. Our next example features a player several hundred points higher rated than the previous one. Strangely enough, his break down of the imbalances turns out to be worse than his lower rated predecessor, but his moves turn out to be better! How can this be? The main reason centers around the nature of White's moves: though he hasn't bothered to completely understand the position (by breaking down the imbalances), he still plays dy namic moves that always try to achieve some positive goal. In the previous example, White was aware of the Bishop versus Knight imbalance, but he never really made use of it. Simply put: dynamic moves based on ignorance tend to be better than passive moves based on fear.

However, my King would then be open. I could also play QbS to support the d5-square and then NdS. I could also pin by BgS to control dS more." I told him that he was not breaking the position down into imbalances. Instead he is just looking at a bunch of moves.

White deserves a lot of credit for the way he's playing.

White has Bishop and Knight versus two Knights. My Bishop has to move to complete development. So that would be one of my first considerations. I also control d5 so I could move my Knight to d5 attacking his Queen. This would also allow me to occupy both open files." If we compare 1200 with the previous player (1600), we can see that 1600 ignored the main imbalance but played purposeful moves towards a secondary goal (which isn't so bad), while 1200 saw the main imbalance very clearly, but refused to make use of it!

Only play a Bishop to those squares if the exchange is good for you or if the opponent can't break the pin. In the present case, Black can easily break the pin. Also, the exchange makes Black happy because he gets rid of White's Bishop versus Knight advantage.
2.Bxf6 Qxf6
1200: " Now I'll advance to dS and attack his Queen." Notice the word "attack." He's not too concerned with the state of the position after Black captures on d5. Instead, all he cares about is the obvious threat to Black's Queen, which apparently gives him an odd sense of power.
3.Nd5 Nxd5
1200: " Now I'll take with the Rook and double up on the open d-file." Notice how he is jumping back and forth between a few ideas. One moment he's trying to control both the c- and d-files. Then he's hoping to control d5. Finally he is going to double on the d-file and try to dominate that. His thoughts are scattered and things only work out because he started with a solid position; trading a bunch of pieces can't hurt his game.
4.Rxd5 Qe6
1200: "Black is piling up on my Rook. Now I can place all three of my pieces on that d-file." Black intentionally plays a planless, passive game (a suicidal act in a serious game, of course) so he can see how White will react.

1200: " Now he's lined up his Queen and King on the a2-g8 diagonal, which is alarming. If 6.Qc4 I don't have any threats. How can I get to that King? I can play Rd6 and chase the Queen; this will give me a check on c4 if the Queen moves off the diagonal. However, he has . . .Qf7 when the

Why not continue to restrict Black's pieces and simply leave the opponent helpless? Yes, the win would take time, but a chessplayer is nothing without patience. The second illusion is White's worry that Black will place a Rook on d8 and exchange some more pieces. It doesn't take a strong player to see that any Rook move to d8 would simply hang a Rook! The final illusion is based on the a2-pawn. White seems unaware that any move of the d5-Rook would hang a pawn to .. . Qxa2 . It seems clear to me that White's confusion is due to the lack of threats in the position. If he can't make a concrete threat, he feels that something must be going wrong. He won't be able to make any real chess advances if he doesn't mend this flaw in his thinking processes.

Tips * The imbalance of Bishop versus Knight is of vital importance. If you have the Bishop you must strive to take away all the advanced posts from the enemy Knight. If you have the Knight you must fight to create a good home for the horse and to create situations where the Bishop is not particularly useful. * Bishop versus Knight does not necessarily favor one piece or the other; you must plant the seeds which allow your piece to prosper. The same holds true for all the other imbalances. If you don't recognize and use it, you will find that this so-called advantage won't do you any good. * You must take your opponent's possibilities into account! * Don't ever play a quick, thoughtless move. That will usually turn out to be the move that ruins your game.

As interesting as I found the position that arose in Silman-Gross, I realize that some may find it dull. It is a quiet position and it does require a subtle understanding to make anything of White 's chances. Perhaps this type of chess does not allow us to fairly assess the Bishop versus Knight acumen of the average class player. Perhaps a more dynamic situation would show other aspects of the amateur's mind that we have not yet seen. (14) •·· •

� · [j• � ��. � � Fischer-Taimanov, Palma de Mallorca 1970. White to play. True, the position in the diagram is an endgame. However, White must react sharply if he is to prevent Black from achieving an ideal set-up with his Knight on the wonderful c5-square. What are the imbalances? White has a queenside pawn majority while Black has a majority on the kingside. The main imbalance is the active White Bishop versus the rather unassum ing Black Knight. Notice how White's two imbalances are work ing together-the Bishop's sphere of influence and the White pawn majority are both on the queenside. All this seems nice for White but Black threatens to eat a free White pawn (on h4) with check. He also would like to play . . . Ne4 (another way is . . . Nf6-d7-c5), when White can either give up his strong Bishop or allow the Black Knight to reach its dream square on c5-a post that would stop the White pawns dead in their tracks. How can White stop all these threats? The answer is that he can't! If White wants to make use of his differences, he

must give u p the h4-pawn (not wasting time on its defense) and tum his queenside majority into a powerful passed pawn.

Does this mean that most experts would find all these moves? No, I think that the majority would not come close. Sharon, though, had been well-versed in the imbalances (we had many sessions where I would yell, moan, and foam at the mouth. She quickly realized that the only way to shut me up was to learn these things!) and understood that her Bishop and majority had to take precedence over every other consideration. 3 ... axb4

This example showed us how positional considerations (ma jority and Bishop versus Knight) often need to be supported by tactics.

34 / THE AMATEUR'S MIND
1700: "My h4-pawn is hanging with check. The imbalances are three versus two majorities for both sides. The Bishop is better than the Knight. Black has a weakness on b6 while White has a hanging pawn on h4. What to do? What is my idea? King on g3, pawn on b3, and then the c4-c5 advance. What is the ideal square for the Black Knight so I can stop it from getting there? Where would it like to be? The hole on cS seems best, blocking my c-pawn and attacking a4. I have to prevent this. My Bishop stops . . .Rdl+, my c3-Rook must stay put and defend c4. All this must wait, though, since my h4-pawn needs to be attended to!"
1.g3?
He noced that the c4-c5 advance was important for him but he wanted to do it only after the preparatory moves g3 and b3. Why so, slow to pull the trigger? He also pointed out that Black wanted to place his Knight on c5, and that he wanted to stop this from happening. Unfortunately, though he read the position well, he couldn't detach himself from the fact that his h4-pawn was hanging with check. Yes, m a perfect world he would have liked to play b3, defending both c4 and a4. In a perfect world he would like to guard h4. But Black has ideas too, and sometimes it's a race between you and your opponent actualizing your respective concepts. When such a race for positional mastery appears, you must play quickly to achieve your goals, even if you have to make positional or even material sacrifices to do so! 1 . . . Nd7 1700: "I will place my Bishop on d5 where it attacks f7 and defends c4. This frees my Rook." Black could have played . . . Ne4 but I wanted to see if he would try to punish me with 2.c5 bxc5 3.Rxb8+ Nxb8 4.Rxc5, though 4 . . . Rb4 allows Black to put up a fight. As it turned out, White never even considered it.

Don't forget: you must not only follow your own plan, you must also take the opponent's ideas into serious consideration. 2 ... Nc5 1700: "He is attacking my a4-pawn. I will start a counterat tack." Why did White feel that this was the moment to start a counterattack? Why not earlier, when he could have made use of his advantages? The answer, I think, resides in wishful thinking. Earlier, White felt he could guard his h-pawn and still push through with his other plans (without seriously looking at what Black was going to do). Now he sees that his plans have ground to a halt, and with the dawning of reality comes a panic-sparked need for counterplay.
3.Rf3 Nxa4
1700: "I must take back on f7." Notice how White is spending too much time with reaction ary moves. First he defended his h4-pawn without regard to the other factors on the board (material takes precedence over positional considerations for most players. This is a big flaw, but it's very common). Then he let Black place his Knight on cS. Only at this point, when Black had made his Knight the equal of the Bishop (and the once-active b5-Rook had been turned into an out-of-play piece), did White see the need for counterplay. This shows us that you must make use of what you have before its usefulness fades away: In other �ords, use it or lose it!

This game showed u s that you must make use of your positive imbalances or they will turn into negatives. It also demonstrated what happens when you play a game of reaction: you end up playing defensive moves that do nothing but guard against the opponent's threats (but fail to stop his overall strat egy). Such tactics inevitably lead to a deterioration in your position that results in a slow and painful death or an eventual game-stopping blunder.

White grabs some space in the center but lets Black grab the Bishop pair. Which are better in this position, the Knights or Bishops? At the moment that question has no clear answer, it is up to both players to shape the pawn structure to suit their individual minor pieces. 5 . . . d5 1100: " Looks like a French Defense. This should be fine for Black. " A sharp but risky move. The simple 5 . . .h6 forces White to give up his Bishop with 6.Bxf6 since 6.Bh4? g5 picks up the e4- pawn. After 5 . . . h6 6.Bxf6 Qxf6 Black would attempt to show that his Bishops are superior to the White Knights. It is important to be on the lookout for ways to create imbalances right in the opening.

1 100: "That was the problem! Though I must admit to not seeing it. How about . . . Qb6? Or, if you don't like that, then 6 . . . h6 comes into consideration.

8.Bb5
1 100: "White has knocked a hole in the kingside. Both are fighting for the center. Black can start taking in the middle and, at the moment, Black's Bishops are locked in. I like White's position since he has Knights and more space. If 8 . . . c4 the center gets locked and Black does not want this to happen since he owns Bishops. 8 . . . a6 is good since the trade is no big deal. I like 8 . . .Bd7 best." If both sides are fighting for the center (as 1 100 wisely said) then why consider passive moves like . . .Bd7 or . . .a6? Black should take the fight to his opponent with 8 . . .Qb6! with an immediate attack on b5 and pressure against b2 and d4. After 8 . . . Qb6 9 .Bxc6+ bxc6 Black has gained another center pawn (which he can use to hit the center with . . . cxd4 followed by . . . c6-c5). Also, after 9.Bxc6+ bxc6, Black's light-squared Bishop can come strongly into play via . . .Ba6. It's also interesting that 1100 likes the White position. This must surely come from the spatial plus offered by the pawn on eS and, more importantly, from Black's cracked kingside. All this is illusion, though-Black is the one with the advantage! White's e pawn and d-pawn are under pressure. As for the "cracked" kingside, Black enjoys an open g-file for his Rook and the potential lord of the dark-squares sitting on f8 (it cost White his dark-squared Bishop to rupture Black's kingside pawns. The price was too high). Nevertheless, I understand l lOO's trepidation. Most amateurs have an unholy dread of kingside attacks. This means that any opening up of the kingside structure tends to send them into a panic. 8 ...Bd7 This creates a little trap: 9.O-O Nxe5! nets a pawn. This is a nice trap to know, and it occurs in many different situations. One
T H E B A T T L E B E T W E E N B I S H OP S A N D K N I G H T S / 3 9
might think that Black's move is good since it breaks the pin, develops a piece and sets a trap. But you must expect your opponent to see your threat: Don't fall in love with traps! The main problem with 8 . . . Bd7 is that it's basically a bit passive. It fails to put any pressure on White. This allows the first player to create a plan of his own (based on the imbalances): he will try to dominate the Black Bishops with his Knights!
9.Bxc6 Bxc6
1 100: "I think White did Black a favor and I like Black's position more and more. Black can take on d4 and play his Bishop to b4, or . . . Rg8 puts pressure on the g-file." The Bishop doesn't do anything on c6. I would still prefer 9 . . .bxc6 with an open b-file and one more pawn that can attack the White center and blow things open for the two Bishops. To address l l OO's previous comments, . . .Rg8 puts a Rook on the file but such attacks need the support of several more pieces if they expect to draw success. Also lacking in sting is a later . . . Bb4. What will the Bishop do on that square? Black's target should have been the White center (which restricts the Black Bishops), but he has not gone about this duty with sufficient energy.
10.O-O Bg7
1 1 00: " Putting more pressure on e5, but I don't see the value of it since e5 is easily defended." Black has been floating for the last several moves and he continues to play without an active plan. Small wonder that the White Knights soon take over the game.

1 100: "I like Black's position. He has a lot of power on the g-file." 1 100 likes the Black position because he has an "attack" on the g-file. This is very attractive to the amateur. However, a realistic look at this position would show that White can easily d�fend the g2-point, when he is left with an extra pawn and two strong Knights versus two poor Bishops. These factors add up to a winning position for White. For example, White can now simply defend with 16.g3 or he can switch over to a counterattack with 16.Nxc6 bxc6 17.Qa4 when Black's only hope is the mate on g2-something White will never allow! Ti p s * If the integrity of your position is based on a one mover like . . . Qxg2 mate, then you are dead meat since such an obvious threat is usually easy to parry. Jnstead, you should nurture long-range plusses like material, superior minor pieces, etc. * When you find yourself crossing your fingers and hoping he won't see it, you know that you are in desperate trouble! * Once a minor piece imbalance is established, you must play with great energy to make that imbalance favor you.

I am always raving about how a Knight must be deprived of advanced support points, so I was curious to see if two of my junior students (aged six with a 900 rating and nine with a 1200 rating) would catch on to this idea in the game we just looked at. (18) .. .i. :1 ·l • 'A • • •• • • • 900 and 1200-Silman. Black to play. 900: "White is better." 1200: "No, Black is better because he has the two Bishops." 900: " r still like White but I don't exactly know why." 1200: "I'd go 1 . .. c5 to attack the Knight and chase it to a bad place." I suppose 900 liked White since a glance gives the impression that White has the more active position; his Knight just looks better than everything else. However, a few pawn moves will show that this is just an illusion. 1 ... c5

There is no way that Black should allow th� trade of his mighty c-pawn for the poor pawn on f4 (which just blocks White's Bishop and Rook). 2 . .. b6

A very interesting moment, and one that demonstrates how many types of blunders are created. The attack on d8 made them focus their attention to that square. Thus the other threat, that of Ne7+, was completely missed. How does a player avoid this pitfall? One way is to write your move down first and then ask yourself, "After we play 6 . . . Be4, can he take anything (yes, the Rook on d8 is hanging!) . . . does he have any checks?" At this point you would notice Ne7+ and, if such a move were really a threat, you would erase your move and look for some thing else. 6 .. . Be4

The game was stopped. The kids did excellently! The previous example showed us how important it is to deprive enemy Knights of advanced support points. It also showed us how a fixation on one threat or square can lead to an unfortunate oversight. I should point out that any kind of fixation in chess is bad since it blinds you to other possibilities. No rule is correct all the time! For example, what if you have to make the following decision: You have two Bishops versus a Bishop and Knight. Should you take a square away from a Knight but close the position as you do so, or should you open the position and leave the Knight on its post?

Black has the two Bishops and there is little doubt concerning the strength of the one on a8 which, combining with the Queen on the a8-hl diagonal, creates mating threats against the White King. Unfortunately, the White Knight is blocking this line on e4 and the only way to chase it away is by . . . t7-f5. Is this the right idea for Black? The answer is a resounding no! This pawn advance does chase the Knight away but it leaves Black with a backward pawn on e6 and a permanently weakened square on e5 (which White could eventually reach by Nd2, Rf2, Nf3 and Ne5). Another reason to avoid . . . f5 is that it makes the central situation stiff; it would be very difficult to open things up, and Black does want to open the position up since that would benefit his two Bishops. After considerable thought, Black resisted the temptation to play the inflexible . . . t7-f5 and instead played directly to rip open the middle of the board.

Black to play. 1700: "White has chances on the kingside since his Queen, Knight and Bishop are all pointing towards the Black King. White's King is exposed but well protected since the Queen and Rook defend the g2-square. "What would Black's fantasy position be? He would like to make the Rook on e 1 move off the first rank and mate on h1 with his Queen via . . . Qhl mate. Black would also like to get rid of his dark-squared Bishop and create weaknesses on that color complex. In terms of space, White is ahead. Since it is Black to move, how can he achieve his fantasy mate? At the moment, White's Bishop is better than Black's on g7-no doubt about it." What to make of this? He did not go into detail about Bishop vfoerr sus Knight and instead raved about a possible kingside attack White (though he never told us how White was supposed to make this attack a reality) and a possible mate on hl for Black (I suppose he sees both sides mating each other on the kingside!). He finally decided to chase the Knight away, but his reason for doing so had little to do with Steinitz's laws (take away advanced support points from enemy Knights) and more to do with a vision of a quick mate.
T H E B A T T L E B E T W E E N B I S H O P S A N D K N I G H T S I 4 9
The question must be asked: will White allow such a mate on the light-squares? Can Black force it? Naturally, White will do everything in his power to prevent this one move knockout. 1700 must make the following adjustments in his thinking processes if he wants to improve his playing strength: >- Always expect the opponent to see your threat(s). >- Always expect him to make the best move! When you find yourself crossing your fingers and hoping that he won't see it, you are making a big mental mistake and are embracing very bad mental habits. >- Playing for a tactical shot (. . .Qhl mate or . . . Qg2 mate) is fine if you can force it. If not, take your time, keep your eyes on the tactics, get the rest of your army into the battle, and pay lots of attention to the positional features on the board! You're never going to go anywhere if you can't blend positional and tactical considerations together. 1 ...f5
2.Nd2
1700: "So I have forced the Knight back but now I must make an enemy Rook give up control of g2 or hl since the White Queen is no longer defending g2. Unfortunately, I can't find a way to get his Rooks to move. If I could make his Knight move to fl , it's still mate (via . . . Qhl). How can I accomplish this? How about 2 . . .Bxd4 3.cxd4 and now 3 . . .Rxd4 or 3 . . .c3. Both give play but I can't see a clear continuation. It's interesting, though. I need to find some plan if there is no mate. I'll sacrifice with . . .e5." Lusting after a quick, violent conclusion (even though his two Bishops give Black a long-range plus), Black finally throws himself over a cliff. Why the hurry? Why the need to give up material? What is this guy doing? 2 ... e5??

Still living in the world of "He won't see it." I have tried hard to break 1700 of this habit but he clutches to it like life itself. By beating lots of lower rated players in this manner, he's convinced himself that he' s doing something profound. That's why I recom mend seeking players who are better than you. Yes, you might lose lots of games, but you will certainly get stronger and learn lots about chess that those weaker victims would never be able to show you. 3 . . .Re7

1700: "This allows me to . continue with my idea after 4 . . . Bxe5 5.dxe5 Rxe5 and he can't take due to . . .Qhl mate. Wait a moment! Aren't I down a Bishop if he doesn't take? My Rook does get to d3 with pressure for the piece so it deserves consideration. Let's calculate: 4 . . . Bxe5 5.dxe5 Rxe5 and now he just moves his Rook and I lose-it doesn't work. I don't see how I can get his Rooks out of the way. I can also consider a different idea, namely 4 . . . h5 and 5 . . .Bh6. However, it's very slow since his Knight will come to f3 and block everything. I can't mate him! White is well protected here. I think that White had the better position all along; there is no question about it. I gave up a pawn to try to rip open the middle and fight it out but it was all in vain." Notice that when reality hit him he began to blame the position. His problem is that he wants instant gratification. Trying to make use of one's advantages in a slow, controlled manner is an alien concept to him. He only speaks of kingside attacks and mate. At this point I stopped the game in disgust. Tips * Always expect the best move from the opponent. That way you will insist your moves accomplish some positive goal, no matter what the response might be. * If you have two Bishops, take note of that fact and try to open up the position! This takes precedence
T H E B A T T L E B E T WE E N B I S H O P S A N D K N I G H T S / 5 1
over chasing an enemy Knight from an advanced support point (you can do this at a later time). * Rules and guidelines are useful, but every rule was made to be broken. If you own the Bishop pair and they are already active (or the position is already open), then you must concentrate on limiting the range of the enemy Knight. Our next diagram shows a rather exaggerated case. (21) Hort-Ciocaltea, Budapest 1973. White to play. Hort saw that Black's Knight had no future on the queenside, so all he had to do was deprive it of any kingside squares and it would be a useless slab of meat. Once he killed the Knight, he could take his time and torture his opponent, secure in the knowledge that Black would be quite helpless.

The Knight can't go to f6, and now Black's pieces are also deprived of h5 and f5. Grabbing my trusty old 1700 student, I set up the initial position from Hort-Ciocaltea (diagram 21) and had him give it a try (he took the White pieces). 1700: "First I must look for an imbalance for both sides. White has two Bishops but his pawns are doubled. How ever, g5 limits the Knight and h4 to follow up gets the pawns going. Black has a weak pawn on a6-it's not really passed since the White Bishop stops it. Black has backward pawns on d6 and h7. White's Bishops are active. White also has more space. As White, I must decide which side of the board to attack. I also want to limit his Knight and control f6. However, if he comes to f6 it's just a waste of time since e4 is not available. Black's plan is to get his Knight to c5, so I must prevent that." He saw that Black wanted to get his Knight to c5 but he evidently overlooked that the way to that square was from f6-d7- c5. He also mentioned that White has two Bishops and that the scope of the Black Knight should be limited. However, once he said this he promptly forgot to do anything about it! Because 1700 gave so many confusing messages in his initial statement, I feel it would be to the readers' benefit to examine some of them iri greater depth: > He said that g5 followed by h4 gets his pawns going. What does this mean? Does gS followed by h4-h5 threaten anything at all? I'm not saying that the advance of the h-pawn is a bad idea, but I don't think he realized what this advance would really do. > He said that Black has backward pawns on d6 and h7. Those are not backward pawns! A pawn is only backward if it stands on an open file (which these don't) and if it doesn't have a brother pawn behind it or directly to the side of it. The d6-pawn would be backward if White's dS-pawn were gone. > He said that Black's a6-pawn wasn't really passed. Wrong again. The a6-pawn is indeed passed. It
T H E BATT L E B E T W E E N B I S HOPS A N D K N I G H T S I 5 3
might not be going anywhere, but that doesn't mean that it's not a passed pawn.
1.Ba5
Missing his opportunity to restrict the enemy Knight. The concept of restriction seems a hard one for amateurs. 1 .. . Nf6 1700: "He's going to d7 and cS so I will attack d6 and slow him down."
2.Bb4
A purely reactionary move that just forces the Black King towards the center. Why play Bb4? Is the opponent going to hang the d6-pawn? I suspect not (especially when you're playing an International Master who is listening to your every thought!). Then why attack it in the first place? Remember: only attack something if the move improves your position even after he defends the attacked object. 2 . . .Ke7 1700: "I must activate my King." In an endgame it is always a good idea to bring one's King towards the center. However, he doesn't seem to have any clear plan in mind. One reason for this is that he missed his chance to come up with an easy plan (dominate the Knight) and now the increased difficulty has left him completely confused. If you are lazy or careless early, the chances are that matters will become much worse later on.
3.Kfl Nd7
1700: "Black wants to go to b6 and attack c4. From there he can also jump into a4. If I play Bd3 I give up control of a4. I will bring my King closer." Black had no intention of playing . . . Nb6. The amateur often thinks that a move with a threat is something to covet, when in reality a simple threat is usually easy to parry. The real quest is to find a square where the piece is happy, active, and secure. Avoid squares where it makes a one move threat and then gets chased away.

5.BxcS dxc5
White has gained a passed pawn and Black's pawns on a6, cS and eS are all isolated. However, these factors don't carry any weight at all. Why? First, to accomplish these things White had to give . up his Bishop pair. Now he is left with a bad Bishop (his center pawns are on the same color as his Bishop) versus Black's good one. Though the pawns on a6, cS and eS are all isolated, none of them are in any danger-Black's King will block White's passed pawn (via . . .Kd6) and defend both c5 and eS. The White King, however, will not be able to get close to the pawn on a6. We should also not forget that the pawns on e5 and a6 are also passed; that's two passed pawns for Black and only one for White.
6.g5
1700: "This takes away f6 from his King and fixes his pawns on white." The best thing he's said all game! It is always good to fix enemy pawns on the same color as your Bishop since then they are vulnerable to the Bishop's later attentions. 6 ... Bc8

So far we have seen Bishops and Knights dominate each other in different ways. However, how easy is it to make the decision concerning which piece to retain and which to give up? Could a student recognize when a Bishop would beat a Knight or vice versa? (22) Silman-1850. Black to play. In this posmon (from the game �avalek-Kaplan, Solingen 1974) Black has three possible scenarios: 1) He can play 1 . . . Rc5 and play a Rook and Knight versus Rook and Bishop endgame. 2) He can play 1 . . .Nxe4 and transpose into a pure Rook endgame. 3) He can play 1 . . .Rd4 and go into a Bishop versus Knight endgame. 1850: "We have an endgame. I recall hearing that a Bishop is better than a Knight if passed pawns are on two sides. Here my King is in jail and my Rook is attacked. What would I like to do? What do I have? Where is his Bishop going? Do I exchange? What piece should I trade? I like l . .Rd4 because I can follow with . . .f5 and get a passed pawn. 1 . . . Rd4?? I find it amazing that he would recite the rule that states, "A Bishop is better than a Knight if passed pawns are on both sides of the board," and then play directly into the inferior side of such a situation! It sounds to me like he had too many choices and got
58 I T H E A MAT E U R · s M I N D
hopelessly confused. However, when you have the luxury of knowing the previously stated rule then you might as well make use of it. Instead of this, another rule (almost a joke rule actually, but there is still a lot of truth in it) says, "All Rook endgames are drawn." Following this, we can accept that 1 . . .Nxe4 2.Rxe4 fS gives Black .good chances to hold the game. The swap of Knight for Bishop also makes a lot of sense; Black should see a pawn race coming and, knowing that Bishops are strong in such situations, he should hasten to hack the White Bishop off the board. Evidently, it is not enough to know the rules and guide lines-you must also make use of them!

So we now have a situation where the Black Knight will not be able to cope with the White passed pawn. On the other hand, the White Bishop will easily stop any passed pawn that Black can create.

THE CENTER,
TERRITORY,
AND SPACE
Every chess player is attracted to beautiful combinations and razor-sharp kingside attacks. This attraction makes us want to emulate the great attacking masters and, as a result, we study games by Kasparov, Alekhine, and Tai. Though this ability to calculate is invaluable-and at least a basic understanding of the mechanics of attack is imperative-the positional elements of chess tend to be ignored by the legions of amateurs that love the game. Why? Do amateur players think that subjects such as territory and the center are boring? Or could it be that the literature on these subjects simply presents the informa tion in a dull manner? Whatever the reason for this relative ignorance might be, most amateurs don't have a clue about the proper use of a space advantage or a full pawn center. Instead they constantly look for 6 1

forcing continuatiol'l:s aimed at the enemy King and, once they give themselves the green light, they will start a completely unjustified attack or, even worse, just sit tight and do nothing at all. Personally, I like nothing more than tq create a large pawn center and squeeze my opponent to death in its space-gaining coils. After the game the poor victim often has a glazed look in his eyes; he knows he lost badly but he is not quite sure why. Ru l es of the Center O ft he three areas of a chess board (kingside, center and queenside), the center is by far the most important. The reason for this is that your forces can move to either side with minimum effort and maximum speed. Thus, it is usually an excellent idea to play in the middle if you have the option to do so. Unfortunately, most amateurs seem to have "wing vision," they are always looking to play on one wing or the other. The following rules concerning play in the center and on the wings may prove beneficial: RULE 1 - A fullpawn center gives its owner terri tory and control over key central squares. (23) White's full pawn center (diagram 23) is well protected by other pawns and pieces. This center gives him strong control over c5, d5, e5 and f5. This will, in turn, assure White of an advantage in territory.
A QU ! S ! T ! O N D F T H E C E N TE R . T E R R I T O R Y . A N D S P A C E I 6 3
RULE 2 - OWning a full pawn center is a responsi bility! Once you create it you must strive to make it indestructible. If you achieve this goal, then your center will cramp and restrict your opponent for the rest of the game. RULE 3 - Don't advance the center too early! Every pawn move leaves weak squares in its wake. (24) Advancing the e-pawn weakens both d5 and f5. Notice (diagram 24) how the Black Knight cannot advance to the fourth rank due to the White center's influence. Even after . . . Nc6 or . . .Ng6, the Knight would still be unable to find an advanced central post. However, if White were to advance his center with e4-e5, then the d5 and f5-squares are suddenly available to the tormented horse. RULE 4 - If your opponent has created a fullpawn center, you must strive to attack it. This creates a battle of philosophies: He is telling you it is strong, you are telling him that it is a target. One of the most common cases of allowing a "strong" center in order to attack it comes about in the Alekhine's Defense.

After 1.e4 e6 2.d4 d5 3.exd5 exd5 it doesn't take a genius to see that the open e-file will be a nice place to stick a Rook (following the rule that Rooks belong on open files). RULE 6 - If the center becomes locked, then the play switches to the wings. After 1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 c5 3.d5 e5 4.Nc3 d6 5.e4 it's easy to see that the center is a dead zone. All the play will have to take place on the sides of the board. RULE 7 - With a closed center, you know which wing to play on by noting the direction that your pawns point. The pawns point to the area where you have more space and that is the side that you want to control.

In diagram 25, Black's pawns point to the kingside (the c7-d6- e5 pawns are like a finger pointing in a specific direction). White's pawns can be construed as pointing in both directions the e4 and dS pawns take aim at the queenside while the c4 and d5 pawns point in the opposite direction. In general, you want to push the pawn that stands next to your most advanced pawn. This means that Black will try to achieve . . . f7-f5 (gaining space and opening a file for his Rook. Black's most advanced pawn is his e5-pawn, and the . . . f7-f5 push follows our rule nicely) while White will play to get a pawn side

by side with his most advanced pawn: the guy on d5. This means that c4-c5 (White should avoid f2-f4 because, after . . .exf4, Black would gain access to the e5-square, his g7-Bishop would become very active, and White's e-pawn would be backward) is our goal (gaining queenside space and preparing to rip open files on that side of the board).
RULE 8 - A
wide open center all ows you to attack with pieces. A closed center generally means that you must attack with pawns (this enables you to grab space and open files for your Rooks). R u l e s of S p a c e In general, having more territory is a very positive thing. You get more room for movement and your pieces experience superior coordination. However, as your pawns advance (your extra territory is mapped out by pawns in much the same way that a fence demonstrates the land you own) certain squares may become weak, and it is possible-like ancient Rome-to expand too far too quickly. For this reason, you must only annex extra space if you think you can control the territory behind your pawns. Also helpful are the following rules: RULE 1 - When you have more space, it is usually a good idea to avoid exchanges. (26) All cramped up with nowhere to go.
A Q U ! S I T I O N O F T H E C E N T E R . T E R R I TO R Y . A N D S P A C E I 6 7
Black can quietly resign in diagram 2 6 because his minor pieces are so cramped that none of them have useful moves. However, if we were to remove all .the pieces and only leave the pawns and Kings, Black would be fine simply because the cramping effect of the White pawns no longer has anything to cramp! RULE 2 - If you have less space, an exchange or two will give the rest of your pieces more room to move about in. RULE 3 - A spatial plus is a permanent, long-term advantage. You don't have to be in any hurry to utilize it. Take your time and let the opponent stew in his own juices. • • • • • In our first game, White comes out of the opening with an advantage in space but becomes worried about imaginary threats and ceases to think about an active plan for himself. Later, after some errors, White can still get some play in the center but he never even considers this and instead concentrates solely on the wings. (27) 1750-Silman. White to play.

The first moves were 1.c4 Nf6 2.Nc3 c5 3.Nf3 e6 4.g3 b6
5.Bg2 Bb7 6.O-O Be7 7.d4 cxd4 8.Qxd4 d6. 1750 had never
faced a hedgehog formation before (he's an e2-e4 player) and so he was completely unfamiliar with the positions that result. 1750: "White has space and has more pieces out. The Black Bishop on e7 is temporarily bad but this is no big deal. Nobody has any real advantage. Since Black can attack my Queen by . . . Nc6, I would be wise to retreat it to a safer square." was happy that he noted the advantage in space and development, but was disappointed that he didn't make any effort to use these plusses. A lead in development (especially if the enemy King is still in the center) is most useful if the game i:;an be opened up. In this case Black can castle inunediately, so the development issue cannot be used in the traditional manner (e.g., attacking the King). However, if White had noted Black's sole weakness on d6, he might have hit upon a plan that called for an immediate attack on this target by Rdl, b3 and Ba3. More fuel can be added to this fire by NgS and, after the trade of light-squared Bishops, Nge4. In this case the better developed side's attack is difficult to parry since Black is not fully mobilized yet and his pieces are not ready to rush to the d-pawn's aid. Theory has shown that Black can defend against these ideas, but I am always delighted to hear a student talk of "targets." Remember that one doesn't just attack a King; you must also attack squares and pawns. If you have such a target, and also have an advantage in development, you must make instant use of this weapon before it disappears (a lead in development is temporary since the opponent will eventually catch up!). Another plan White has is to make use of his space edge by increasing it whenever possible and playing to stifle Black's counterplay (based on the . . . b6-b5 and . . .d6-d5 advances). Instead of dealing with these issues, White cops out and starts to worry about his Queen being attacked. Keep in mind that an attack on your Queen is no big deal since you can simply move it to safety. The opponent doesn't gain points for screaming, "Check to your Queen!" The moral is: Don't fear checks or one

move attacks. Just make sure that they are ineffective in the given position and go ahead with your own plans.
9.Qd3?
This wastes a tempo and places the Queen on another vulner able square since . . . Nbd7-c5 will be uncomfortable. Since he did mention his edge in space, I would have been very happy if he tried to increase that advantage by 9.e4. Fearing every possible threat that the opponent can throw at you turns you into a timid player who reacts to ghosts. Avoid this label and make sure that every move you make does something positive!
9 .. . O-O
1750: "Since I have more space, I want to increase it by moving up in the center with e2-e4." That's more like it! To repeat: Every move you make should have a positive base and be geared to increasing the advantages that you already possess.
10.e4 Nbd7
1750: "He threatens to put a Knight on c5. IfI stop that by b4 then my c4-pawn is without potential support. So I'll stop it by Be3. " This illustrates a typical problem with the amateur's thinking. Seeing a threat to win material (via . . . NcS, hitting the Queen and e4-pawn), White notes that he can protect himself and develop a piece with 1 l .Be3. However, he fails to take into account the resultant position after he loses his dark-squared Bishop for the enemy Knight. Don't make positional concessions to pre vent a threat unless you have no other means of defense. ll.Be3? Better was ll.Nd4 (the immediate 11.Qe2 is also fine) which allows the Bishop on g2 to help in the defense of the e-pawn. Then 1 1 . . . NcS or 11 . . . NeS can be met with 12.Qe2 followed by b2-b3, when White would still have a solid position and a spatial plus. It's clear that White didn't want to move his Queen again, preferring to give up a permanent imbalance (the dark-squared
7 0 I T H E A M A T E U R ' S M I N D
Bishop) in. order to hold on to a temporary thing (the tempo that the Queen move would lose). ll. . . Nc5 1750: "He's attacking e4 with three pieces so I have to capture him." The sins of his ninth move (9.Qd3) plus the laziness of his eleventh (11 .Be3) have come back to haunt him. Note how he keeps making concessions. First 9.Qd3 to stop a Knight from making a harmless attack on his Queen (this cost him a tempo and placed the Queen on an even more vulnerable square), and then l l.Be3, a move that gives up the two Bishops and the dark squares.
12.Bxc5 bxc5
1750: "I was considering 13.h3 but I'm not worried about him going to g4 with his Knight. I'll move my Rook to el to give my pawn some added support." Since the player with less territory should strive to exchange pieces (and thus relieve his cramp), Black can be happy with his acquisition of Bishop for Knight. White is still making a big error by not formulating an active plan. Instead, he keeps guarding his e-pawn and worries about various harmless Knight jumps. Instead, something like 13.e5 clxe5 14.Nxe5 Qxd3 15.Nxd3 Bxg2 16.Kxg2 is sensible since it gets rid of Black's Bishop pair by swapping one off. By isolating Black's c-pawn, White can now entertain thoughts of pressuring it with a later Na4. I'm not saying that this plan is good for White, but it would have shown a good mental attitude in that White would have been actively attempting to devalue Black's Bishops and trying to create a target on cS.
13.Rfel Qb6
1750: "He's attacking my b2-pawn. I'll simply defend it." White doesn't realize it, but he has allowed Black to take the initiative. This is shown by White's readiness to keep making defensive moves.
14.b3 Rfd8

1750: "Defending d6 and perhaps threatening to play a . . .d5 advance. If he pushes his pawn to d5 I'll go e4-e5 and attack his Knight. It's still basically even. I'll play Radl and strengthen my control of the center." White is playing reasonable looking moves but he is slowly but surely running out of constructive ideas. By this I mean that he lacks a clear object of attack. It's not enough to just move your pieces into the center and hope that something good happens. It's your job to turn that amorphous "something" into a solid entity. To accomplish this, you must make all your pieces work towards a single goal. In our present game, White does not have a clear goal in mind. Note that the d6-pawn, though technically backward, is so solidly defended that White cannot hope to put any real pressure on it.
15.Radl Bc6
1750: "He's preventing me from attacking his Queen by Na4. He's also preparing to play . . . Qb7 and increase the pressure in the center. If he does that I will play Nd2 and back that pawn up. Now I can play Qe3, which prepares to redirect it to the kingside via Qf4, etc." Every time your opponent moves, you should ask, "Why did he do that?" It's very important to understand what the other side is trying to accomplish. Though White has paid attention to his opponent's plans throughout this game, he has not put enough energy into his own ideas. Now he seems to be leaning towards a kingside attack, but is this a realistic hope or a plan born out of the frustration caused by his earlier inactivity?
16.Qe3 a5
1750: "Starting a wing attack via . . .a5-a4. I can move my Knight to d2 and defend both e4 and b3 now or later. Another idea is to play Rbl . I'll first move my Queen to the kingside, defend on the queenside as I need to, and start an attack by g3-g4-g5." White finally realizes that he has to do something aggressive. However, a kingside attack is not a very realistic goal since Black has no weaknesses on that side of the board and White's army aims more at the center than at the kingside. White should have been playing for an e4-e5 advance.
72 / T H E A M A T E U R ' S M I ND
17.Qf4 a4
17 50: " Now I'll play Rbl, which makes his Queen a bit uncomfortable." The Black Queen is not a bit uncomfortable since if White ever plays bxa4 Black would simply move his Queen to safety and start to chew up the weak White pawns on a4, a2 and c4. Unlike White's earlier display, Black has no fear of one-move attacks.
18.Rb l e5
1750: "Forcing me to move my Queen. I can consider Qh4 but my Knight on c3 is undefended and my Queen is in a risky place. I'll move it back to the safe e3-square." Black's last move (18 .. .e5) fixes the center and takes away ,White's chances for counterplay based on a e4-e5 advance. Though some players might be horrified by the apparent weak nesses on d6 (backward pawn) and d5 (weak square), these tum out to be illusions. The d6-pawn is firmly defended and if a Knight jumps into d5 then Black would capture it. This would lead to a White pawn going to d5, which would cover up the hole and the backward pawn.
19.Qe3 axb3
1750: "If I play Rxb3 he has to move his Queen. If . . .Qa6 is played, I can easily defend my attacked c4-pawn. It's still even." White gets surge of confidence by attacking the Black Queen. Why? Does White really believe that Black will hang his Queen? I hope not. Then what makes an obvious one move attack so deadly (White fears such attacks from the opponent, and feels empowered when making them himself)? Nothing! They are not deadly in the least; in fact, they are more often than not Icno mpletely useless. the present case, White will take on b3 with his Rook and attack Black's Queen. However, once the Queen moves to safety, White's pawns on a2 and c4 will be extremely weak.
20.Rxb3?
An "active" move that worsens his position. Correct was
20.axb3 (leaving himself with only one target on b3 to worry
AQU ! S ! T I O N O F T H E C E N T E R . T E R R I T O R Y . A N D S PA CE I 73
about instead of two-one on a2 and one on c4) followed by Nd2, when his position would still be very hard to crack. White's statement claiming equality is way off the mark. He has no play and it's only a matter of time before White's two queenside targets lead to his demise. 20 .. . Qa6 1750: "Attacking c4. I can protect my pawn by Qe2, Qd3 or Nd2. The Knight move seems best since it also defends e4. "
21.Nd2 Rd7
1750: "He intends to double his Rooks. He can also play . . . Rb7 but since he could have played this right away ( . . . Rdb8) he must intend ro double on the a-file. Now I could move my Knight to d5 when it's attacked by two pieces and defended by three. Unfortunately, I need this Knight on c3 to defend my a2-pawn so I can't do that. I can attack his d7-Rook by playing Bh3." Still lacking a plan, White resorts to a series of one move attacks (20.Rxb3 and 22.Bh3). This is a typical amateur mistake. A one move attack is fine if it contributes to the overall improvement of your position. If it has no other point, then the move is simply a waste of time (your opponent will move his piece to safety!). If you look closely at White's next move, you'll see that he's just forcing Black to make a good move.
22.Bh3 Rda7

1750: "Tripling on the a-file, but who cares? It doesn't do him any good at all. Now I can continue to attack his kingside by g4-g5 and chase his Knight away." White is feeling pretty good right now but this is completely unjustified. Nevertheless, many people go into depressions and play badly when they get such poor positions so his positive attitude may serve him in the game. Actually, 1750 is quite a fighter and has saved many hopeless positions by refusing to acknowledge that ail is lost. He always thinks there's a chance (this attitude is worth its weight in gold since even strong Grandmasters have been known to lose their vigilance and make bad errors in winning positions).
23.g4 Bd8
1750: "Intending . . .Ba5, attacking c3 and a2 in tum. I can push up my pawn to a3 after . . .Ba5 so I'm not worried about that. I'll continue my attack on the kingside." The Knight on c3 eyes the d5- and b5-squares and also defends the a2- and e4-pawns. Black would be happy to trade his bad Bishop for such a useful Knight.
24.g5?
An unfortunate decision. White has weakened his King, the g-pawn and the f4-square. Now he allows the Black Knight to take up residence there. Don't create weaknesses in your own camp. When you see a hole like f4 being created, a danger signal should go off in your head! 24 . . . Nh5 1750: "Heading for f4. Now I can move into d5 and protect the f4-poinr. Unfortunately, he will capture and move into f4 anyway. If 25.Nd5 Bxd5 26.exd5 Nf4 27.Bf5 and Qe4 still gives me an attack on h7 and his King. Whoops! I forgot that if I move my Knight I lose my pawn on a2. I must first guard my pawn and then Ne2 or NdS guards f4."
25.Rb2?
Much too passive (though a good recommendation is hard to find). He should have accepted the loss of the a-pawn and tried
A Q U ! S ! T ! O N O F T H E C E N T E R . T E R R I T O R Y . A N D S P A C E I 75
to find some way to bring his b3-Rook over to the kingside along the third rank. If you're getting positionally squashed and mate rial loss is also looming, don't curl into a ball and wait to die. Give up some ballast (material) and attack the opponent for all you are worth. Put a scare into him and try to upset his equilibrium. 25 . . .Nf4 1750: "Now he threatens to win my g5-pawn. I have to guard it. On Qg3 the e2- and d3-squares are covered. "
26.Qg3 Bxg5
1750: "If 27.Qxg5 Nxh3+ wins my Queen by a fork. I better get my Bishop out of there." Now Black has won material, enjoys a safe King and has retained the initiative. It's all over.
27.Bfl Bd8
1750: "I've lost a pawn but I'm not lost since I'm still firm on the queenside. I have to get rid of his Knight." He could admit he's lost and give up but instead he lies to himself and fights on. I can't criticize him for following the edict, "No one ever won a game by resigning."
28.Ne2 Ne6
1750: "Heading for d4 so I must maintain my Knight on e2. I'll attack his pawn on d6. "
29.Qd3 Bc7
1750: "I'll head my passive d2-Knight to f3, h4 and f5. Also possible is Bh3, attacking the e6-Knight. Advancing f2-f4 can also be considered."
30.Bh3 Qc8
1750: "Now his Knight is pinned, but he's threatening my pawn on a2."
31.Ral Ra3
1750: "Attacking my Queen. I'd like to play Nc3 and head for d5 but it would be pinned. It's still good, though. I'd just have to move my Queen out of the way first."

Ultimately, your plans should prove to be stronger than his. * Don't make pointless one-move attacks. If you are crossing your fingers and hoping he doesn't see it, you are making the wrong move (you are also building bad mental habits). Always expect your opponent to see your threats! You want to play a move that improves your position no matter what he does. I tend to repeat this a lot, but I find it's a mistake that the amateur makes over and over again.

In our next three games we see Black allowing White to build up a very imposing center. Would the amateurs (all playing White) be able to make use of this central space advantage? Would they even notice that space was the advantage they possessed? These are important questions-if you can't ascertain what kind of imbal ances exist, you won't be able to make use of them.

5.Nf3 Ne7.
White reacted with scorn to Black's choice of opening. It's certainly ugly-looking, but it turns out to be a tough nut to crack! 2000: "6.Bd3 with the idea of eventually smashing him with f4-f5 is the obvious move." His attitude shows some positive and negative features. The positive side is his confidence; he knows Black has played something fishy and he wants to punish his opponent for the insulting choice of opening. The negative part of White's reaction is the speed taken for his decision and the fact that he ignored the imbalances. When someone does something unusual, you must take extra titne to measure its plusses and minuses. This doesn't mean that there is anything wrong with 6.Bd3. I just expect the student to
78 I T H E A M A T E U R. ' S M I N D
demonstrate a greater understanding of the position before a move is chosen!
6.Bd3 b6
2000: "Wow, he really seems to be asking for it! How can I rake quick advantage of that move? Any targets? I'll just develop the rest of my army." White is still refusing to take a calm look at the imbalances. The main factor in White's favor is the advantage in space that his big pawn center gives him. With this in mind, White should play to strengthen his center and prevent Black from undertaking any central counterattacking ideas (this is illustrated in the next game). By blindly developing his pieces, he breaks one of my big rule _s: First develop a plan and then develop your pieces around that plan� If you develop your pieces before you attain an understanding of the situation, you may ultimately find that your army is standing on the wrong squares!
7.O-O O-O
8.Be3
2000: " Strengthening my center." Finally mentioning his center, but not going any deeper into the position. While 8.Be3 is clearly a good move, this shouldn't disguise the fact that White is exhibiting signs of laziness. Instead of taking a long think and becoming master of this particular situation, he sits back, flicks out a developing move and hopes that positive things will just happen. 8 ...c5 2000: "I can consider 9.dxc5 but 9 . . . dxc5 looks boring. So my options are 9.dS, 9.eS and 9.Ne2. Pushing my d-pawn by
9.d5 seems bad because it leaves me with a weakness on
d5. The Knight retreat to e2 looks too passive for my tastes. Though 9.e5 gives up the f5- and d5-squares, it opens things up and leads to a tactical battle that would suit my style. "
9.e5?
A very poor move. Black has just initiated a central counterat tack, so what does White do? He goes along with his opponent's

Since NbS misplaces the Knight on the side, I'll go for exd6." White is still playing without any kind of plan. He is not reasoning things out and he is not analyzing any variations. This type of "move by move" existence is often employed by players from the beginning level right up to the revered ranking of master. No matter what your rating may be, it is the wrong way to play chess!

White has completely failed to evaluate the position. If he had. taken some time to do so, he might have realized that opening up the center and giving Black two Bishops is not a logical course of action. He should have envisioned this several moves ago (before he allowed it to happen), since now all the trumps rest in Black's hands and it is too late for White to do anything about it.

(30) White to play. 2000: "An active move that may not be sound. I have to be careful not to exchange a bunch of pieces and end up in an inferior Bishop versus Knight endgame. Since 14.Nxd4 Rad8 runs into several pins (15.Nc6?? Qc5+ and 15.Nce2 Bxe2 are both bad for me) and 13.Rf2 Rad8 also looks terrible, I must challenge his idea and chop off his material!" Shocked into action, 2000 finally looks at a few variations and takes the correct mental stand: If you see a way to win material and don't see how your Wgher rated opponent can escape, you must go into the line and keep Wm honest. I have to point out that the variation he gave on his 12th move via 13 . . . Nxf3+ (instead of Black's 13 . . .Ba6!!) 14.Qxf3 Rb8 1 5.Radl also favors Black because the Bishop on g7 is better than any other minor piece on the board.

The most accurate order was 14 . . . Bxfl 15.Nxd4 Rxa8. The text was played to see how White would react to a greater range of choice. 2000: "I could keep the Exchange with 1 5.Rf2 but 15 . . .Rd8 gives him tempos and is passive. The main move is 1 5.Nxd4, when 15 . . . Bxfl 16.Kxfl consolidates. So on 15.Nxd4 he will pin with . . .Rd8 or . . .Qc5 when 16.Ne2 Bxe2 17.Qxe2 Bxd4+ 18.Khl favors me." 15 .Nxd4 Rd8?! 2000: "Since 1 5.Rf3 Bxd4+ and . . .Bxc3 wins for him, I have to block with my c3-Knight.

19.g3."
Notice how White never started any ideas of his own. Instead, he just developed his pieces and reacted to Black's play. This type of descent into the opponent's world happens quickly and quietly and must be avoided at all costs. Naturally, the only way to avoid this is to impose your will on the game before the opponent does!

1600: "I have good central control and a kingside space advantage. I want to continue my development and keep an eye aimed at the kingside. I would also like to maintain the e7-Knight's lack of mobility. Though this position looks good for me, Black is not just going to roll over; there is plenty of opportunity for him to get play in the center." Not at all bad! He's making a determined effort to break down the position. This effort was lacking in the previous game, even though 1600 is much the weaker of the two. What nobody mentions is that a kingside attack can only succeed if you control the center or if the center is locked. Because of this, and his extra central territory, White should strive to make his center indestruc tible and to restrict Black's counterplay. Once this is achieved, White can turn his attention towards one of the wings.
6.Be2
1600: "Develops the Bishop and prepares to castle and activate the Rook." Is the Bishop better on d3 or e2? Though d3 enables White to envision an eventual f4-f5 break, I must ask how real this

possibility is. Ifi t turns out to be just a pipe-dream, then e2 makes sense since it allows White to place a Rook on the d-file and discourage Black's . . . c5 break. 6 . .. b6 1600: "He's going to play . . .Bb7 and put pressure on the e4- pawn."
7.O-O
1600: "Looking at it afterwards, I think my O-O was a poor move. If the center closes up, my white Bishop would be good and his is a bad one that he could exchange by . . .Ba6. With my Rook on fl this exchange would be forced." This type of thinking just takes up time and makes a player paranoid. At the moment the center is not closed (meaning that White does want to be castled) and Black's light-squared Bishop is far from being bad. Besides, the first player can't really stop . . . Ba6 anyway. If Black wants to take three moves ( . . .b6, . . . Ba6 and . . . Bxe2) to trade a piece that's moved only once then White should rejoice. Don't allow yourself to get in a state of mind where everything your opponent does has some lurking threat behind it.

Bishop is freed but my d-pawn is weak. If he closes with . . .d5 then a later . . .c5 makes it like a French-type opening. It also gives him use of the f5-square. So I don't like the e5 advance. I'm also looking at a fantasy plan of Knight on g5 and Rook on h3 with a kingside attack but that's easily defended against. His threat is to attack d4 with . . .c5 and . . .Nbc6 with pressure so Be3 looks good." It must be kept in mind that pawns on e4 and d4 control all the critical central squares. As soon as you push one of them you give up some of this control! After 8.e5? Black would not activate White's fl-Rook and cl-Bishop with 8 . . . dxe5?. Instead, he would simply play 8 . . .

8.Be3
The game was stopped because the student's time had ex pired. Black's position is not easy. White intends to play Qd2 and Radl when a . . . c7-c5 advance would allow White the opportunity to rip open the d-file whenever it was favorable to do so (White would only play dxc5 in answer to . . . c5 after he got his heavy pieces on the d-file). Also note that . . . c7-c5 followed by . . . cxd4 leaves Black with a backward pawn on d6. Because of this potential weakness along the d-file, Black's plan of . . . c7-c5 is not very effective. Unfortunately, Black doesn't have any other meth ods of counterplay and White can lay claim to an advantage. All this comes from White's extra space and Black's lack of active play. Ti ps * If you're going to worry about something, make sure it is worth worrying about! * Games are often won by simply taking space and restricting the opponent's options.

"I can find moves that protect my center, but is that enough? I'm looking at Bc4. 6.Bd3 doesn't seem bad either. Also reasonable is 6.e5, gaining space, but I can do that at any time. That's why Bd3 is all right since e5 frees it. "Black must attack the center. He can do this with any one of four pawns but the most likely is the c-pawn. There is something to be said for placing the c3-Knight on e2 and bolstering my center with c3. I'll go for Bd3." I was very happy that he seemed to remember the content of our lesson on the center. I looked forward to him defending his center with everything he had. The fact that some of his moves were incorrect didn't bother me (for example, his idea of 6.Bc4 is poor since it walks into a . . .d6-d5 advance). Far more important than moves are ideas, and his first big think showed that he was trying hard to use every idea he had been exposed to.

Bb7 1950: "There is no reason to rush the center-guarding c2- c3--I can do this whenever I need to. There are more important moves to play. Ordinarily you don't want to castle where a fianchettoed Bishop is bearing down but, in this case, he has fianchettoes on both sides! However, my pawn center is blunting both of them. "I can't help but be tempted to play g4 with the idea of Ng3 but it leaves my King open. Kingside castling also looks natural since it placed the Rook on the someday-to-be opened f-file. I'll go for the restrained approach." What's this about not castling in the direction of a fianchettoed Bishop? Is this some sort of chessic urban legend? Just because a Bishop aims at your King doesn't mean it's mate!

1950: "Now I feel that his King is stuck on the kingside and I'd like to play there. I'll try either c3 or Be3. By defending d4 with c2-c3, my e2-Knight is free to move to g3 and threaten f4-f5. To stop this Black will be tempted to play . . .t7-f5. Then exf5 . . .gxf5 opens his King. However, if he answers 9.c3 f5 10.exf5 with 10 . . .exf5 then I feel that I have given up my good central pawn. So perhaps the immediate
9.g4 is the right way to go.
He was so careful to defend his center and then he suddenly abandoned the idea and went charging the kingside. Why? The simple 9.c3 (or 9.Be3 with c3 to come) would give him a fine game with no weaknesses. Only after making his center inde structible should he entertain ideas concerning attacks against my King.· ·

1600: "! like 6.Bc4. It attacks t7, threatens NgS and allows me to castle. He could push to dS but then I play Bb3 followed by Nc3 when it's equal. Another interesting move is 6.c4 when 6 . . . dS 7.Nc3 Nf6 8.cxdS Nxd5 9.Bc4 Be6 10.0- 0 is promising." This incoherent litany really shows why he doesn't do so well in tournaments. He never tried to figure out what he had that his opponent didn't. Due to this, he began to look at moves in a complete state of ignorance. Not seeing (or caring) that he had a slight advantage in space, he first looked at 6.Bc4, saying that
7.Ng5 would then be a threat. Why? Would Black just sit around
and allow White to capture on f7? At the moment, the g5-square is covered by three Black pieces, making Ng5 impossible. How ever, even if White did manage to play Ng5, Black could toss in . . .d6-d5 and end White's one-move threat instantly. He also mentioned 6.Bc4 d5 7.Bb3 followed by Nc3 (he proudly claimed equality for White. Why is early equality desir able for the White pieces?). However, 7 . . .c6 leaves the Bishop on b3 hitting granite while the c3-Knight would also find itself doing nothing (can't go to e4 and is putting no pressure on the well defended d5-square). Finally, his claim that 6.c4 d5 7.Nc3 Nf6 8.cxd5 Nxd5 9.Bc4 Be6 10.O-O?? (10.Qb3 is strong) is promising falls on its face after 10 . . . Nxc3 when Black has won a piece! It's clear that he is just trying to develop his pieces, but you must only develop pieces to posts where they do something, preferably in relation to the imbalances (in this case, space).

Why let the Black Knight remain on the active e4-square? With 6. Bd3 White develops the Bishop to a safe but important post and gains time by hitting the enemy Knight. 6 . . .Nf6 1600: .. White is slightly better because he has space and his dark-squared Bishop is better than Black's. White should gain more space. How to do this? 7.c4, 7.O-O and 7.BgS are all good. Even 7.h3 is possible which keeps Black's Bishop . back. l'd go for 7.h3." He finally began to take note of White's spatial plus and, as a result, he got one right. 7.h3 is an excellent move because it restricts the enemy pieces-the player with an edge in space should be choking the opponent's army at every opportunity. 7:h31 O-O

1600: "White can play 9.Bf4, 9.BgS, 9.Rel, 9.Nc3 and 9.c4. I'd probably play 9.Rel ."
9.c4
White's plan consists of increasing his advantage in space and, at the same time, in taking away squares from the enemy pieces. The advance of the c-pawn fits in nicely with these ideas: White grabs more space and takes the d5-square away from the Black pieces. 9 . . .Nc6 1600: "Fighting for the squares on dS and e4 by 10.Nc3 is correct. This also keep a flexible position." The Knight-move to c3 is very natural and good. Some of my students have recommended 10.a3, preventing . . .Nb4. However, this Knight sally is nothing to fear since Bbl saves the Bishop. Then White, by a2-a3, could chase the Knight back to where it came from . Don't go out of your way to prevent things that cause no real harm!

11.Rel Bf8
1600: " 1 2.Be3!? is best, since I don't like exchanges." While I don't like his 12.Be3, which just clogs up the White army, I do like his statement that exchanges are not what White wants. It appears that 1600 is well aware that the side with more territory should avoid unnecessary exchanges since that just helps to relieve Black's cramp.
12.RxeS
The trade of one Rook won't do any harm to White's cause. 12 . . . QxeS 1600: "Now 13.Bd2 followed by Qc2 and Rel is indicated. It's still just a bit better for White because Black is veiy solid."
13.Bf4
The Bishop is obviously more active here than it would be on d2.
13. ..Bd7
Note how the lack of space prevents Black from posting his pieces on active squares. 1600: "I don't like Qc2 anymore. 14.Qd2 gives potential for sacrifices and a kingside attack." So he finally realizes that his Qc2 had no real point (aside from allowing potential forks by . . . Nb4). This is why one should make the Queen one of the last pieces to be moved; you often don't know where it belongs until most of the other pieces are out.

Perhaps 1 5.Nd5!? which threatens Nxf6+ and ties his Queen to the defense of c7 is worth trying. If . . . Bxh3 wasn't a threat, I'd love to play 15.Rel ." When someone makes a threat, it is very important to deter mine if this threat is real or imagined. In the present case, White thinks tha1 Black is threatening to sacrifice on h3. If Black's sacrifice ultimately fails, then why would you go out of your way to prevent it? In this case Fischer sees that . . .Bxh3 is nothing to worry about so he happily continues with his space-eating ways.

Why must Black allow his pawns to be shattered by Nxf6+? If 1600 was Black, would he actually play . . . Nxd3 and let this happen?

problems. Another idea is Nh2 and Ng4. " Why the crazed wing attack? I t seems that most amateurs suffer from a lack of patience. They probably think that if you don't do something forcing, then your advantage will disappear. In this case White sees that . . .Bf5 is still a threat so he centralizes his Knight and prevents thi� move once and for all.

First 1600 says that White doesn't have any real attack. Then he says that White must attack. What's going on here? It's clear to me that quiet play in the middle and slow build-ups are alien to
1600. In his mind, you must attack even if your chances for
success are not good. Ultimately, a simple question must be asked: why weaken one's King when you can play quietly in the middle with no risk?

Black's position is a big hole . . . i t's bad. "White doesn't have any imbalances. Well, that's not quite true, he has one on f4 (though it's guarded by the Knight). White has space everywhere while the open file for Black means nothing. The best place for the White Knight is e6. White does not want to trade Knights because his is more mobile than the Black one. White can also cramp Black some more by h5." This is just terrible! After several weeks of lessons, 1700 thinks that imbalances are weaknesses. I must have failed badly to let him believe this, but let's stop you, the reader, from thinking the same thing! Imbalances are differences in the position! One person can have a Knight and the other a Bishop. That is an imbalance! One can have space while the other player has the superior pawn structure. That is also an imbalance (note that it's sometimes not clear who the imbalances will ultimately favor). While imbalances can be weak pawns or weak squares, they can also be many other things (and can be positive, negative or neutral). For the most part, everything 1700 said was off the deep end. In fact, if this is how he actually thinks, I'm amazed that he keeps a rating as high as 1700!
1.h5??
I almost had a heart attack when he played this positional blunder! In many ways, this move is far worse than hanging a piece. Why? Because everyone, even Grandmasters, hangs pieces from time to time. Hanging a piece is a moment of blindness. But playing a move like 1 .h5 shows a horrible lack of understanding about chess. Clearly, this is far more serious. When you have an spatial advantage in some area of the board (and White's resides on the kingside), it won't mean anything if you can't find a way to break into the enemy position. White had a clear route into the kingside via the h-file, but closing it by 1 .h5 permanently closes that road. White has gone from a clear advantage to a disadvantage in only one move! 1 . . . Rb4
2.b3 Rtb8
9 6 I T H E A M A T E U t ' S M l N D The center is closed and the kingside is also locked up. This means that Black is free to devote his full attention to the queenside. 1700: "Black is t1ying to pile up on the queenside; he's hoping to take the pawn on c4 (by . . . R8b6, . . .Qb7 and . . . Rxc4) and pick off the Rook on bl. This is permanently prevented by Nc3."
3.Nc3 Qb7
1700: "He's pinning my e-pawn to my King. What happens if I play Nd5 and attack his Rook?" Black is targeting all of White's potential weaknesses. These are the pawns on b3, c4 and e4. It's clear that Black has all the play.
4.Nd5 Qc6
1 700 "Why does he want to give me a Rook for a Knight? I don't understand this. Do I take his Rook or do I double on the b-file? Ahhh . . . if 5.Nxb4 Qxe4+. What does that do? It does not look so bad for me. For example, 5.Nxb4 Qxe4+
6.Kh3 when White's not winning, but Black might have a
draw. "Actually, he might get my Knight and two pawns for that Rook. This is good for him so I can't do that. I'm also worried about 5 . . . Nxb3 6.axb3 Rxb3 but that's not so dangerous. I better protect my e-pawn." He doesn't realize it yet, but White's no longer following a plan of his own. Instead, he's just reacting to Black's ideas (in other words, Black has the initiative).
5.Rel R4b7
1700: "Black has queenside space but his pieces are inac tive . How good is space if your pieces are not doing anything? So I must take the fight to him even if I lose a pawn: 6.b4 cxb4 7.Nxb4. However, then 7 . . . Qxc4 is pos sible. I'm nor worried because I will take with the Rook." 1700 is a frisky guy, but if you have less space . than your opponent -you should not go out of your way to open things up. 1700's desire to win at all costs often clouds his judgment.

Remember: desire mixed with the cold light o f reason is something you want to nurture in chess. But emotion and wishful thinking are enemies of every player.
6.b4??
You should always be able to list the great things your moves do for your position. In the present case, 6.b4 only helps Black's cause. Notice how this move opens the b-file for Black's Rooks and creates a self-inflicted weak pawn on c4. 6 ...cxb4

a3-a4, followed by an eventual b4-b5. Hovvever, it is not enough to look at your own plans to the exclusion of the opponent's. Just what is Black going to do? Apparently, he will attempt to advance in the center with . . . Bf8 and . . . e6-e5 (thus annexing territory of his own). Why should White allow this? Why not take space everywhere and leave Black vvith little or no counterplay? This is the reasoning White employed when deciding on his next move.

Grabbing a spatial plus in the center. Now White would welcome 1 . . . dxe4 since 2.Nxe4 would allow him to make use of the d6-square and, once White castles and places a Rook on el, the backward pawn on e6.

My Bishops are superior. The h2- Bishop is bad but it's outside the pawn chain. Black has a slight space edge on the kingside. Black's d6-square is weak. White definitely has the better game here. Due to the nature of the position (closed center) I can get more space on the queenside with b4." He did a good job in recognizing what White had. Unfortu nately, he didn't pay attention to his opponent's plans.

I am debating whether to castle or not to castle right now." He's doing reasonably well. This time he noticed some Black ideas, but he didn't bother trying to prevent them. In fact, it never occurred to him to strike in the center first. Why make it a battle between one person's queenside attack versus another person's center or kingside attack when you can have it all?

3.a4 e4
1500 "Grabbing more space in the center. I'll move my Knight over to the queenside." All of a sudden Black has a space advantage in the center that aims at the kingside. This translates to active kingside play for Black, compared to the passive stance that Black was forced to endure in the Silman-Barkan game.

1 500: "Black is playing for a kingside pawn storm by pushing his pawns there. So I should push on with what I want to do since it's now a race."

THE
CONFUSING
SUBJECT OF
PAWN
STRUCTURE
If you ask an amateur player what he thinks of when you say hanging, doubled, backward, or isolated pawns, the most likely response will be "a weakness." Unfortunately, most amateurs don't really know how to go after pawn weaknesses, much preferring the thrill of a King-hunt. The other side of the story follows the same pattern. If the amateur gets these so called weaknesses, he usually panics because he is not aware of the dynamic potential inherent in all these structures. The simple truth is, it's impossible to label anything in chess as always being weak. The examples that follow show when to punish the existence of these pawns, and when to welcome them into your own position.

White to play. NEGATIVE - The doubling of pawns reduces their flexibility and, at times, leaves one or both of them vulnerable to attack (though it's usually the lead pawn that is the weaker). White's c-pawns are doubled in diagram 38. Though the pawn on c3 is very safe, the guy on c4 is further advanced and thus vulnerable to attack by the enemy pieces. Black will torment this pawn by . . . Nc6-a5 (when his Bishop and Knight both attack it) followed by . . . c7-c5, . . . Rc8 and, if necessary, . . .Ne8-d6.

NEGATIVE - A backward pawn is only weak if it is sitting on an open file and if it is unable to advance. The side playing against the backward pawn should strive to control the square directly in front of it (turning it into an immobile target), since this square cannot be defended by a pawn. One way to do this is to exchange allthe pieces that defend this square. In diagram 45, White will play to increase his control over the dS-square by NdS, c2-c3, Na3-c2-e3 and, if necessary, g2-g3 followed by Bg2. If White could exchange off Black's c8-Bishop and Knight (the only two pieces with potential influence on dS), the first player would have permanent control over dS . POSmvE - A backward pawn acts as a guard to a more advanced pawn to the side of it. This ad vanced pawn can block enemy pieces and control important squares.

Under normal circumstances, Black's Knight wouldn't be able to stay on d6 since White's pressure on the d-file would make it run away. However, in this case the d5-pawn is acting like a traitor by blocking it's own pieces. With White's pawn stopped, the active Black queenside majority shows itself to be more valuable.

The pawns on d4 and c4 control all the important central squares (e5, dS and cS) and give White more space. If White can make his pawns safe from attack (putting his Rooks behind them strives to do this) then this advantage in territory will give him a promising position.

1600: "There is a possible discovered attack on my Queen on the e-file. But there are two pieces in the way at the moment so I will continue to back up my pawns with my Rooks, which also gives my Queen more room to move." There is an old saying that goes: "When in doubt, place your Rook opposite the opponent's Queen, it's bound to prove useful." Though this is partly said in jest, the truth is that a quick d4-d5 advance can now be thrown out the window since it opens up the e-file and brings the dormant Rook to life. However, even if Black's Rook did not stand on e8, this advance, which does activate the b2-Bishop, also gives Black's Knights access to c5 and is usually only played if there is some sort of tactical justification to backOift up. course, it turns out that . . . Re8 has a more substantial purpose than some hazy hope of a future attack against White's Queen. That purpose will become clear after Black's next move.
14.Rfdl BfS
1600: "If I go back to fl with my Queen then . . .Bb4 might be good for him. There is also a possibility that he will play an . . . eS advance. I don't need to worry about . . .Bb4 because I can defend by Bc3." White was showing signs of early laziness in placing his Rooks behind the pawns without a detailed plan of action. Now that he has moved his Rooks, he becomes hopelessly passive and doesn't even try to find further ways to improve his position. The problem White is facing is the very common fear of ghosts-a fear of things that may or may not be real. It is the job of the player to decide whether a threat is real or not, but you can't ever decide one way or the other without proof. This means you must analyze and come to a final and clear assess ment of the situation. Is the White Queen really in enough danger to warrant its retreat to the passive fl-square? No, of course it isn't. Is . . .e6-e5 a threat? No again. So it seems that White went out of his way to place his Queen on a bad square for absolutely no reason at all . If you find yourself in this kind of mind-set, you will never come up with dynamic ways to put pressure on your adversary.

More aggressive (and constructive) ideas are 15.NeS NxeS (if Black does not do this then White will follow up with 16.Ndf3 with a very nice game) 16.dxeS Nd7 17 .Ne4 and though White has a weak pawn on c4 his control of d6, pressure down the newly opened d-file and chances of attack against the Black King give him many attractive possibilities.
15.Qfl?
1600: "So my Queen is safe if he plays . . .eS." Black never came close to threatening . . . e6-e5 so White has found himself in a frame of mind that will come up often in this book-the overwhelming desire to respond to every possible threat (real or imagined). This is the bane of most amateurs and must be avoided at all costs. In this case, White has used a precious tempo to move his Queen from a fine square to a poor one. 15 . . .g6 1600: "He's going to put his Bishop on g7. I can move my Bishop back to bl and then swing my Knight over to b3." This shows the main idea behind Black's 13•h move. The Bishop will go to g7 where it will defend the King and eye the target on d4. Notice how Black is improving his position with every move while White is floundering about in a panic.
16.Bbl Bg7
1600: "I can now swing over to b3 . . .wait! He'll go . . .Bxf3 and open me up on the kingside. I can move my Queen to d3 before I play Nb3, then f3 is defended." White is still reacting to every Black possibility. At least he realizes that his Queen was not participating in the game on fl , but the original e2-square is where it really belongs.
17.Qd3 Qc7
1600: "Putting more pressure on c4. I can put pressure on the e-file by Rel followed by NeS. At the moment, my Knight is not doing much. "

19.Nb3 Qf4
Tempting was 19 . . . Ba6 while 19 . . . Ng4! with the threat of 20 . . . Bxf3 was extremely strong. However, I wanted to give him a bit more room to come up with his own ideas. 1600: "Now he's attacking my f3-Knight and also threatening to move his Bishop to e4. If I move my Knight to eS he still can play . . .Be4. It's better to move my Knight back to d2."
20.Nfd2?
He's so sure that everything is going to be bad for him that he miscalculates. Black doesn't threaten 20 . . .Be4 because 21 .Rxe4 would wi� two pieces for a Rook. Also 20 . . .Bxf3 21 .Qxf3 Qxf3
22.gxf3 is not necessarily the end of the world for White. Finally,
20.Ne5?? would have lost to 20 . . .
Nxe5 21.Rxe5 Ng4. A bad or lazy attitude will always lead to the worst possible results. Never give up hope and even if things have not been going well you must fight to the bitter end. You will be surprised how often you can turn a game around! Instead of this passive and useless retreat (remember: 20 . . .Be4 didn't work. Don't take time out to stop your opponent from blundering!), White should have remained calm and played the simple 20.Qe3. 20 ...Ng4 1600: "Threatens to check me. I have to move my Queen to g3."

Still defending and following the basic rules (always capture towards the center). This is simply not good enough! You must strive to come up with creative ideas that challenge your oppo nent! Putting your arms up, closing your eyes and fending off blows isn't going to get the job done.
22.hxg3 Nb8
This Knight is coming to c6 where it will chew on the d4- pawn. 1600: "He has two pieces against d4 and one Rook against c4. I must chase his Knight away."
23.f3 Nf6
1600: "I want to keep his Knight from moving to hS." Why? A Black Knight on h5 would not have helped the second player in his battle against the weak pawns on d4 and c4. Since . . . Nh5 could always be answered by Kf2, White should have taken the opportunity to play a more useful move. Superior was either 24.Kf2 or the more assertive 24.a4! (intending to create a weakness on b6 by a4-a5xb6) 24 . . .a5 25.c5! when the Black pawns are also turning out to be in need of defense. Remember: Be aggressive-create pawn weaknesses, fight for squares and space, do something positive! Just because you have some weak pawns doesn't mean you can't create some in the opponent's camp as well.

28.Nc2 Na5

29.Ne3
The game was stopped here since both 29 . . . Bh6 30 .gS Bxe4 and 29 . . . Bxe4 followed by 30 . . . Bh6 would win material. So the pawns eventually fell (a case of use them or lose them!). This occurred, however, due to inactivity on White's p art. If he had made use of his advantages in space and piece activity then the hanging pawns might well have been heroes instead of goats. Ti ps * Always play to improve your position. Don't panic and retreat from good squares. * Owning hanging pawns means that you must play dynamically. Passive play will lead to your hanging pawns turning into weaknesses. * If you are playing against hanging pawns, you must attack them with everything you've got.

White to play. 1800: "My center pawns are gone and my Bishop is block ing my e-pawn. His c-pawn is weak. He can't move it because his d-pawn would fall. He has more pawn islands and his a-pawn is isolated and weak and my Bishop on e3 ties his pieces down to its defense. I could attack his c6- pawn by Qa4 but this pawn is easily defended. His pieces are passive right now and are sitting on the back rank What's the nastiest move to attack his pawns? Wait a minute . . . 14.Qa4 almost wins a pawn outright! If 14. . .Qc7 then 1 5.NbS! is very strong." White is looking at Black's pawns as weaknesses without any good points whatsoever. This is not a correct view. The trick to battling potentially weak pawns is to first contain them (fix them on vulnerable squares) and only then to attack them (14.Na4 is the best move). Instead, White goes right for the throat but forgets that they can move forward and annex some space.
14.Qa4
T H E C O N F U S I N G S U B J E CT O F PAW N S T R U CTU R E I 125
Note that 14 . . .Qc7 is bad, but White's idea of 15.NbS?� is not the reason because 15 . . . cxb5 wins a piece. Instead, 14 . . . Qc7 fails to 15.NxdS.
14. . .c5
1800: "Now his d-pawn is extremely weak. I don't see how he can defend everything." He has a positive attitude but it's somewhat lacking in realism. Note that White did not fall for 15.Nxd5 Nxd5 16.BxdS Qxd5
17.Qxe8 Bb7.
Now the question is raised: Are Black's pawns wimpy targets or towers of strength? They do control the e4-, d4-, c4- and b4- squares so they can't be all bad! The battle lines are drawn White will try to either win a pawn or force one to advance which will (hopefully) create a weak square on c4 or d4. Black will defend his dynamic duo and try to create counterplay on the half-open b file and e-file.
15.Rfdl Be6
16.Nb5?
1800: "Attacking a7 and cS simultaneously." This move does uncover an attack on c5 but White seems unaware that Black is allowed to play a move too! Don't get so full of your own plans that you forget that you have an opponent. Much better was 16.Bf4 which takes away the b8-square from Black's Rook, threatens Be5 in many situations and creates the possibility of e2-e4.
16. . .Qb6
1800: "Now both his pawns are pinned. There must be a way to pounce on them!" Black was easily able to defend his c-pawn and now threatens something that White misses entirely. However, Black's position was already very good since the White Knight can be chased back, the hanging pawns can be solidly defended by . . .Red8 and . . .Rac8, and White must constantly worry about threats along the b-file and pawn advances like . . .d5-d4.

White shows that he still doesn't understand the position. The Bishop on e3 was not badly placed at all. Indeed, it helped control the critical c5-point in an effort to fix the pawns on static and passive squares. Black's 14 . . . Qa5 is an active attempt to counter White's control of c5 and put pressure on the a2- and e2-pawns. If Black did not do this, White would have gotten a fine game by Bc5 followed by the exchange of dark-squared Bishops and Nc5 with a bind on the d4- and c5-squares. In that case, the Black hanging pawns would play no active part in the game. As it turns out, 15.Rxc6! was correct after all since the complications that follow 15 . . . Bd7 16.R.xf6! have been shown to favor White. I could not expect 1800 to know this but I did have hopes that he would understand the need to block the Black pawns. Something like 15.Bc5 would have made me happy (though 15 . . . Ba6 is a good reply) because his heart would have

been in the right place. Even 15.a3 followed by 16.b4 would have shown that he wanted to control c5.
15.Bd2? Qb5
1800: "He's attacking e2 but this is no big deal; I can push it or guard it with my Rook." White is looking at direct threats and moves but is not looking at a long-range plan. Because of this, he soon ends up in a passive position.
16.e3
Black also gets active play after 16.Rel Bg4.
16. . .Bf5
Here we stopped the game due to lack of time. Black's well placed pieces clearly outgun their passive counterparts. Ti ps * Any kind of weak pawn must first be contained (blocked) before it is attacked. * No pawn structure is always good or bad. Look for the potential plusses in any given structure and make sure the opponent doesn't achieve them. * Though I repeat this in every chapter, I will take time to do so again: Don't just react to the opponent's plans. Find an active idea and follow it with as much energy as you can muster. On the other hand, don't get carried away with your own ideas and forget that you have an opponent. Take his plans into account and make adjustments when necessary. The game that follows, played in a weekend tournament by a student of mine, made a deep impression on me. It takes on.e of

However, Harold (my student) realized that these pawns gained space, tied up the enemy pieces and allowed him to generate play against the opponent's remaining queenside pawns by moves like Rbl and Na5.

1 500: "Three isolated pawns on one file is bad, but on the other hand White is better developed, has an open b-file and is a pawn up. Also Black has no pressure on White's game. White has the chance to sacrifice one of his isolated pawns with c6 and isolate Black's pawns, but first I would like to play my Knight to a5. I like this move but I want to concentrate on my development-I must use this before it goes away. I will play l.Rfdl and activate my Rooks." So I stand humbled-1500 also liked the White position! Is this because isolated pawns don't bother the average amateur, or are my students so well-schooled that they are able to see beyond typical forms of chess bigotry that color most people's perception? I was delighted when 1 500 pointed out that he had to play fast if he was going to take advantage of his lead in development. Actually, just about all of 1500's comments were right on the money. Perhaps I am breeding a race of super-players!
1.Rfdl Rc7

A backward pawn is a potential weakness because no other pawn an defend it, but its main problem is not so much the pawn itself but the square in front of it. The game that follows shows what happens if you ignore this simple fact. (56) Smyslov-Rudakovsky, Moscow 1945. Black to play. Black must move his threatened Bishop. Since 1 . . .Bc8 seems wrong, that only leaves 1 . . . Bd7 or 1 . . .Bc4. Most players don't like having to retreat and prefer the more aggressive 1 . . .Bc4. Indeed, that is what Black chose in the actual game. 1 . . .Bc4?? Would you believe that this natural move leads to a postionally lost game? It does! As hard as it is to accept, 1 . . . Bc4 is a positional blunder. To understand the position, we have to look at the backward pawn on d6. Is this pawn weak or in danger? No, it is well defended. However, the square in front of it (d5) only has two defenders-the light-squared Bishop and the Knight. Black's error with 1 . . . Bc4 was that he traded one of the critical defenders of d5 for a piece that had virtually nothing to do with that square. Smysiov was quick to jump on this mistake.

All right, Smyslov played well, but could a student of mine do the same? I gave this task to 1330. First I gave him a lecture on strong and weak pawns. Then we spent a few weeks on other topics. Once I was sure that he'd forgotten everything we had spoken about earlier, I threw this position at him. Silman-1330. Black to play. 1330: "Well, I have to move my Bishop to either c8, d7 or c4. At the moment White's Bishop is better than mine. I could force a trade on c4 but he would chase my Queen all over the board. Possible is . . . Bd7 but I hate to retreat, and c8 is even worse. I like d7 since my Queen is safe and I keep pressure on fS."
1 3 4 I T H E A M A T E U R 'S M I N D
I began to search for the cattle prod. He didn't even mention the fact that Black was saddled with a backward d-pawn! As for his comment about his Queen being chased around, is this reality or laziness? Let's take a look: 1 . . .Bc4 2.Bxc4 Qxc4 3.b3? Qc6 and the c3-square has been weakened (which in tum weakens c2) by White's thoughtless one-move attack (b2-b3). From White's point of view, we must ask if Black would leave his Queen on c4 after b2-b3? It's clear that a sane person wouldn't. So White is left with the following question: "Did b2-b3 improve White's game in other ways?" Not at all. It just weakened squares and had no purpose other than the obvious attack on the Queen. This shows us that White shouldn't even consider b2-b3 after 1 . . . Bc4 2.Bxc4 Qxc4, and Black shouldn't fear it (in fact, he would happily pay White to play it!). Don't make moves that have no purpose other than some obvious threat that can easily be parried. 1 . . . Bd7! So 1330 played the right move for the wrong reason. 1 . . . Bd7 is correct since it will go to c6 where it attacks White's e4-pawn and defends the delicate d5-square. Then Black can play . . .a6, . . .b5, . . .Qb7 and . . .b5-b4, undermining both d5 and e4.
2.g4
1330: "He is starting a horrifying kingside attack. I'm con cerned about g4-g5 when my Knight has no good squares. I could block that by . . .h6 but this would weaken my kingside. However, I like my Knight's position since it attacks e4 and defends dS." He mentioned the d5-square and the e4-pawn! Thank good ness for that. I would have been even happier if he had first played 2 . . . Bc6 (bringing another piece to bear against d5 and e4), since I was sure that he was not aware of the proper followup to 2 . . . h6. 2 . . . h6

4.Qg3?
4.Nd5 was stronger (a move that could have been prevented
by an earlier . . . Bc6) but I wanted to give him the chance to find an all-star defensive idea. 4 ...Bc6?? Too late. If White can successfully get g4-g5 in, he will have a winning attack. Black could have punished White for his last move by the retreating 4 . . .Qd8!, a move that attacks h4 and covers g5. If White answered this by 5.h5 then Black would be free from the worry of g4-g5. If White played 5.Bf2, then the g5-square wou:d still be in Black's hands and 5 . . .Bc6 would be an intelligent move. Just because a piece moves backwards doesn't mean that it's retreating.

Ti ps * The weak square in front of a backward pawn is often a greater problem than the pawn itself. * You can play to win a square by trading off its defenders. Our final example takes us away from weak pawns and into the world of pawn structure as it relates to the plans for both sides. Deciding whether you want to keep the center open or allow it to be closed is an important decision in chess, and must only be made with a firm knowledge of the other imbalances.

After 10.O-O, if he plays 10 . . .Nc6 then 1 1 .d5 gains time and drives the Knight away. After I castle, White will continue Rel and Nc4 and then he can initiate the capture

on e5. I f Black takes the time to play . . . h6, then White will take on f6. However, after 10.O-O Nc6 l l .d5 Ne7 he breaks the pin on the h4-d8 diagonal, so closing the center with d5 may not be very good. Back to my plan of O-O, Rel and Nc4. I'm not sure where my Queen goes, but after an eventual Rdl his center will fall." When 1650 refers to the pawns pointing in a certain direction, he is trying to make use of my rule of pointing pawns: In closed or semi-closed positions you willusually attack in the direc tion where your pawns point. In other words, the pawns on c7, d6 and e5 are aiming at the kingside-they act as a finger pointing the way. Why does this work? Because that is the direction where you have the most space, and you should usually play where you own more territory. Though it's a good sign to see 1650 thinking about this rule, he's forgetting that the center is still in a state of flux and the pawn-pointing rule only applies to a closed or semi-closed position. If you keep the center open and play in that sector, then the pawn-pointing rule has less validity. This is because the center is the most important place to play on the board and play there usually take precedence over play on the wings. Another interesting but incorrect statement is that "10 . . .Nc6 can be answered by 1 1.d5 with a gain of time." I often notice that amateurs love to attack enemy pieces with a pawn. The reasons for this are: 1) They are attacking something and this threatening gesture gives them a certain sense of security. 2) They think that they are gaining time. Let's look at the flaws in this reasoning. Keep in mind that when you attack something it willmove to safety (I am constantly surprised by the amount of players who harbor secret hopes that the attacked piece will stay put and die!). It is also important to understand that a pawn move only gains time if it chases a piece to an inferior square or places the pawn on a better post than where it started. In the present case, 10 . . . Nc6 ll .d5 Ne7 does not gain time for White because he's closing the position (something that favors the person with Knights), making his f3-Bishop a poor piece and taking away his central play. White should not crow about any of these accomplishments.
1 3 8 I T H E A M A T E U R ' S M I N D
Other things that were stated or ignored b y 1650: 1) He's ignoring the important imbalance of the two Bishops. Since Bishop like open positions, an acknowledgment of this imbalance would tell him that closing the center with d4-d5 might not be a good idea. 2) Black's Bishop is not hitting granite! It's a good piece and can easily become active after an eventual . . .exd4. Admit tedly, the center-closing d4-d5 makes Black's Bishop bad but this would also devalue White's two Bishops. 3) He says that after a certain series of moves, Black's center will fall. Why should this be true? After a move like . . .Nbd7 or . . .Nc6 Black has a firm grip on his e5-pawn. What is really going on? At some point Black can pressure White's e4 and d4 pawns with . . . exd4 (this also frees the g7- Bishop). White should try to kill off this counterplay and activate his tWo Bishops with 10.dxe5! dxe5 (10 . . . Rxe5 11.Bf4) 1 1 .O-O. White would then gain space on the queenside with a4 and b4 and get his light-squared Bishop into the game with Bf3-e2-c4. This plan would give the first player a small but safe edge because Black would have no points of attack and the Black Knights would have no advanced support points. On the other hand, White's Bishops w'ould take up active posts on e3 and c4.
10.O-O Nc6
1650: "If I play 11.d5, then l l . . . Na5 is bad since b3 takes away all his squares. After 1 1 .dS, the center is locked with his pawns pointing towards the kingside while mine aim at the queenside. I don't want to play d5 but I'm tempted because it drives the Knight and gains time. If I do that, where does my Knight go then? My light-squared Bishop also seems poor. I'll tour my Knight to d5 via c4 and e3 instead of closing things." The comment about 11.d5 Na5 12.b3 (he's missing 12.b4, which picks up the poor beast) taking away all the Knight's squares is based on the lesson that the best way to deal with Knights is to take away all their advanced support points. However, why would Black want to place his Knight on the side where it is cut off from the rest of its army? Since he states that d5 leads to queenside chances for White and kingside play for Black, wouldn't it be more logical to bring the Knight to the side where Black intends to pursue
T H E C O N F U S I N G S U B J E C T OF PAWN S T R U CT U R E / 1 3 9
his play? Thus 1 1.d5 Ne7 is much more sensible. Always make the pieces and pawn structures work together, whether you're looking at your moves or your opponent's possible replies.
11.Nc4 h6
1650: "If I go to h4 then 12 .. . g5 13.Bg3 gives me pressure on e5." He tried to go to h4 but I warned him that something was wrong with the move. After a few moments he noticed that he would lose his e4-pawn to 1 1 . . .exd4 12.cxd4 g5 so he panicked and blitzed out a few moves. Let's devote a few lines to the subject of panic. Everyone has been unpleasantly surprised or has had the experience of notic ing-usually at the last moment-that their intended move is bad. If this happens, you must not make any hasty decisions. Instead, forget about the game and take a few moments to calm yourself down. Once this is done, you can reassess the situation and avoid making a decision based solely on emotion.
12.Bxf6 Qxf6
13.d5
Sti)l riding high on emotion, White has ceased to think about his moves. The quiet 13.dxe5 keeps a very safe position. 13 . . .Ne7 Now that the center is closed, the pawn-pointing rule comes into effect. Black will play for a kingside attack with . . . f7-f5 while White should try to create a breakthrough on the opposite wing. Why? The center is closed so the wings are the only places where play can be initiated. Since most of Black's space is located on the kingside (his most advanced pawn is on e5), he should try to add to this with . . . f7-f5 when his space advantage in that area is more apparent. In closed situations, you must play on the side where you have more freedom of movement and try to annex as much space as possible. Note that this is done with pawns advances since that allows files to be opened and the Rooks to enter the fray.

14.a4
1650: "This stops him from chasing my Knight with . . . b5." At the beginning of this game, White did what he was taught and tried to break the position down into its component parts. Unfortunately, he failed to correctly assess matters because his thinking was vague and disjointed. After the shock of hanging material (see the note on the 1 1m move), he played a few hasty moves and from now to the end of the game he does nothing but play one-move attacks or defend against specific threats. In other words, he has been reduced to a purely reactionary role. To be fair, the move that 1650 played (14.a4) is actually quite a good one. My criticism is that he only played it for a defensive purpose (to keep his Knight on c4). He should have been thinking in a more aggressive vein about gaining space on the queenside and trying to drum up an initiative there. 14 ... Qh4
15.Ne3
1650: "I don't like his Queen being there so I'll harass her." Very interesting! A moment ago White was intent about keeping his Knight on c4. However, Black's move upset him-his King is being attacked and he feels the need to defend. Sadly, his statement about harassing Black's Queen is not based on accurate calculation. Instead, he's bringing some pieces to the vicinity of the kingside and hoping that something positive happens for him. Never play moves with your fingers crossed! Never hope that he misses your threat or that things willsomehow work out. All chess players should get rid of words like maybe and somehow. Clarify what's going on to the best of your ability; perhaps you won't get it right but at least you will be creating some good habits. 1650 has gotten lazy and is no longer putting his full energy into the game. 15 ... f5

Another lazy and erroneous thought. Don't think tl:at a King without a full pawn cover is necessarily in danger. A King is only in danger if the enemy pieces can get to it. I don't mind incorrect analysis or incorrect thinking-people can only perform at what ever level they have reached. Laziness, though, is a preventable disease that makes improvement impossible. The capture on fS is bad because it opens the g-file for Black's Rooks and makes Black's pawns on eS and fS mobile. 16 . . . gxf5

Now he should play 20.f4! when he holds back Black's pawns and threatens to initiate an attack on fS with fxeS at some point. The comment about "building up" is less astute:You must first identify a target and only then build up your forces to attack it.
20.Qf3?
Rather than stopping the advance of Black's central pawns, White places his Queen in a vulnerable position and makes the advance of the e-pawn all the more tempting.

20 . . . RafS 1650: "He has a pretty good buildup. I'm not sure how to respond. I like Black's game now. It looks like the tables have turned. " This new bout of depression comes with the realization that the f5-pawn is solidly defended. The rest of White's moves are all on the kingside. This is something that the attacker loves to see because that means White is reacting to what you are doing. Instead of this, he should have been creating counterthreats on the opposite wing (the b7- and c7-pawns are undefended).
21.g3 e4
1 650: "I need to find a good location for my Queen. I would like to play it to g2 for defense but e2 is also tempting because it guards my Bishop on h5." All thoughts of a counterattack are gone. White is only thinking about ways to hold things together.

Black, who is dominating the game on the kingside (note that White never got his queenside counterplay going), easily won. White's position is a real mess after 25.gxf4 Qh4. Ti ps * The pawn-pointing rule is useful to know in closed or semi-closed positions. If the center is locked, you must attack on the wings with pawns. This increases your control of space and opens files for your Rooks. The pawn-pointing rule enables you to tell
T H E C O N F U S I NG S U B J ECT O F PAWN S T R U C T U R E I 14J
which wing you are supposed to play on by "point ing" the way. See the note to Black's 9t11move for a more detailed explanation. * Don't attack something for no reason! Attacking an enemy piece has no value in itself. You must alvvays expect your opponent to play the best move, so he will(and you have to believe this!) see the transpar ent attack and move away to safety. If you have gained something valuable, even if he sees your threat, then the attack is useful. If there is nothing to be gained after his best reply, then restrain yourself and leave his pieces alone! Remember: you are trying to follow a plan that benefits your whole army and takes advantage of the weaknesses in his camp. One-move attacks are only useful if they do something to benefit your plan. * Avoid vague thoughts. Concentrate on one or two important features of the position and go as far with them as you can. This will enable you to stay on track. If you find yourself saying things like, "I'll somehow attack his King," you are being too vague. You must only attack the King (or anything else, for that matter) for a specific reason and you must be very clear with yourself on how you intend to go about doing it. * Don't allow surprise or depression to influence your moves. lf something unexpected or bad happens, you must sit on your hands until you regain you r equilibrium. When this is done, reassess the situa tion as if the game were starting over again and calmly figure out what the position needs. * Don't just react to the opponent's threats. At times, defensive moves are called for. However, if you find that you have lost track of your own plans and are just reacting to your opponent's blows, you must realize that you are on the road to defeat. Chess is a
1 4 4 I T H E A M A T E U R ' S M I N D
game where the opponent tries to impose his will on yours. He wants you to do what he tells you to hdios. Fight like a madman and refuse to go along with agenda!
MATERIAL
0 f all the imbalances in chess, a material plus carries more
weight than anything else. An extra Bishop, or-in top-flight events--e ven an extra pawn, is often more than enough to give you a victory. For this reason, you must be very careful not to give away your units without just cause. Unfortunately, holding on to your pieces is not always so easy. I have noticed that the vast majority of games between amateurs are decided by some gross blunder of material. This means that if you can simply not give anything away (no deep strategy here!) you will see hundreds of points pad your rating. How can we avoid this type of gross blunder? One u1>eful method is to write your move down before you play it. Don't just scribble it, make the written move a work of art! The reason for 1 4 5
1 4 6 I T H E A MA T E U R'S M I N D
this is that, as w e look deeply into a position, our mind goes off on tangents that often take us far afield of the reality of the moment. Writing the move down in this fashion brings us back to the here and now. Once you have written the move down, you should ask, "When I play this move, does my opponent have any checks? Can he capture or threaten any of my pieces?" You will be surprised how often you will suddenly notice that your intended move, the move you placed so much hope in, is in reality a game-losing mistake. Instead of losing the game, though, you can now scratch out or erase your blunder and think of something new. Even though so much importance is placed on material, we must remember that it is an imbalance, just like any other imbalance. Don't win a pawn if it gives the opponent an advan tage in development, space, pawn structure or several other things. Remember that a material plus is a static advantage; don't allow yourself to be beaten by the enemy's dynamics or by a combination of other static factors. If you're lucky enough to find yourself with an advantage in material, you should follow these rules: RULE 1 - Material beats the initiative if you can neutralize the opponent's plusses and equalize the game (this might take quite a few moves to achieve, so you have to ask if you have the time). Then your extra material will , slowly but surely, bring him down. RULE 2 - Material gives you an extra unit of force. If you make this unit an active participant in the game,_ you willhave your opponent outnumbered. RULE 3 - Material edges like the Exchange (Bishop or Knight for a Rook-three points for five) are only useful if you can give the Rook an open file to fly on. An advanced, centralized Knight can easily beat an inactive, useless Rook. This means that you must be careful not to allow simple point count
M A T E R I A L I 1 4 7
(the pieces' numerical value) to influence you more than the particular position. (59) .. 'ii' • • • • • · � tD • • � � � · � � � 1:1 � Black suffers even if he has the move. If we were to judge the position in diagram 59 on point count alone, we would have to say that Black seems to be an easy winner-he has a pawn and a Rook for a Knight (six points to three). However, his Rooks are completely helpless and his extra pawn on d7 is immobile. On the other hand, the White Knight on d6 dominates the board. Black cannot prevent White from playing Rc7 with a winning bind. RULE 4 - When you win material you may find your pieces are off balance and without purpose. That is because they have fulfilled their mission and now need a new goal If they are off balance, don't keep lashing out. Instead, bring your pieces back together, make everything tight and safe, and then prepare a new plan based on your material edge. Remember: extra material gives you a long term advantage. You don't have to be in a rush to use it. • • • • •
1 48 I T H E A M AT E U R ' S MIND
We will begin our look at material advantages with a seemingly simple position in which White is an Exchange up for a pawn. (60) .i. K . ·�··· � Kramer-Thomas, Utrecht 1949. White to play. In the position shown in diagram 60, Black enjoys more space due to his strong pawn chain on b7-e4. The things that White can crow about are his kingside pawn majority and his material advantage. I have stated over and over again: when you try to find a plan, you must base it on the advantages (positive imbalances) in your position. You probably wouldn't wish to rush White's kingside pawns (one of your two advantages) forward (in an attempt to make use of your majority) since that would place your King in peril. This leaves you with that extra Exchange; how can White make use of it? Rooks only reach their full potential on open files. Unfortu nately for White, no completely open file exists. Still, if you want to make use of that extra Rook, you will have to find a way to create a file for it. Before we go further, we must ask what Black's advantages are. As stated before, he has that mass of pawns in the center. He also has to address the difference of Bishop for Rook. Rooks are better than Bishops, but that doesn't mean that you must accept their inferiority and just wait to lose. Instead, you should play to make your Bishop as strong as possible. Black's plan is this: he
M A T E R I A L I 149
will attempt to advance his pawns to b6 and c5 and then he will swing his Bishop around to the powerful d3 post via b5. Armed with this knowledge, White's plan should be easier to find since you must always strive to prevent the opponent fron-1 succeeding in his plans at the same time as you fight to bring your own to fruition.

(6 1) 1000-Silman. White to play. It's now clear that White is winning in our beginning position. However, that takes a high caliber of play, so I set it up again to see how my students would handle this type of technically winning situation. 1 000: "I'm a Rook for Bishop ahead but there are no open files for my Rooks. Black has one extra pawn and is more advanced than me. The pawns on a2, b7 and a7 are undefended but I don't see any way either side can take advantage of this. His pawns are blocking his Bishop so that means his Bishop is bad. This is in my favor. Black can boast that he has more space. So how do I use these advantages? There is a possibility of pinning the d-pawn and attacking
M A T E R I A L I 1 5 1
the one on e4. I must open a file for my Rooks and keep a close eye on my undefended pawns. One plan is Qb3, Rdl d4 and Rxe4 winning a pawn due to the pin on the a2-g8 diagonal. Another similar idea is to place a Rook on dl and play Qxe4 but that's no big deal since he should be able to defend against this type of thing. His e4-pawn stops my Rooks from going to f3 or d3. I'm inclined to advance my f pawn and open a file. I'll do this by doubling Rooks on f2 and fl and then advance the f-pawn by fS and f6." He did an excellent job of picking the position apart; far beyond what one would expect from a 1000 player (we had just finished talking about good and bad Bishops so he was very much aware of that idea). Also impressive is the fact that he noticed some hidden tactical possibilities based on Rdl and Qxe4. Unfor tunately, his reasoning falls apart when it comes to the actual plan chosen. He notices that no open file exists and makes a plan that tries to create one. This is excellent. However, he completely fails to take into account his opponent's moves. Just because you have a superior or even winnin g position doesn't mean there is nothing for your opponent to do!
1.Rf2? b6
Now White didn't ask why I played my move! You must always settle down and try to figure out what your opponent is up to. Instead, White forges ahead with his own (erroneous) ideas and completely ignores his opponent.
2.Rcfl?
Played instantly. Better was 2.Rd2 with the threat of 3.Qxe4. White could then have put pressure on Black's central pawns and tried to discourage Black from advancing them. Of course, White could not expect Black to miss this threat (after 2.Rd2), but placing your pieces on centralized posts is rarely bad, and at the worst serves to make it hard for Black to make use of his center pawns. 2 .. . c5 1000: "I don't like the way your pawns are coming forward. I'll stop them with 3.b3."
1 5 2 I T H E A M A T E U R ' S M I N D
Ali of a sudden White starts to pay attention to Black's moves and now he forgets his own plans and begins to focus on his opponent's! You can't ignore your opponent's ideas but you also must avoid getting to a mental place where you do nothing but react to his moves and ideas.
3.b3?
Now Black's Bishop gets outside the pawn chain (one of the most important things you can do with bad Bishops) and takes up an excellent post on d3. Black no longer has any problems whatsoever. 3 . . . Bb5 1000: 'Tm not going to give you my Rook! I'll go to dl and pin the d-pawn." Notice how everything White does is just a reaction to Black's moves.
4.Rdl Bd3
1000: "You have no threat other than the Queen so I'll go to c3 with activity." White has lost his grip on reality and thinks he stands better just because he's u p an Exchange. This is not true. Rooks are no better than Bishops if you can't make use of them. Don't get trapped in the world of point count and ignore what's happening on the board. s.Qc3 d4 1 000: "I think I'm going to get my open file. After 6.exd4 Qxd4, I'd be happy to trade Queens."

Wait a minute! I just missed the excellent 9.Qxe3! Fortunately I noticed it before I did anything else." I give him credit for noticing this tactical shot (made possible by the undefended position of Black's Queen). It's just bad luck that it doesn't work out.

This turns out to be a serious mistake that allows White to escape with a draw. However, the first player doesn't see it because he becomes depressed. This leads to a sense of hopeless ness, and this again leads to an inability to see what's really going on in the position. Black should have played 10 .. . Rxf4! when the threat of mate on fl gives Black an important tempo. This would have led to the win of a White Rook (much as in the actual game). 1000: "I must retreat to bl. 1 1.Kf2 loses to 1 1 . . . Rxf4 + . " Notice the comment, " I must." Saying this almost guarantees that you will miss the reality of what's going on. "I must" is a chain around one's brain, and must be permanently exorcised from your chess vocabulary!

It's clear that White will become a much stronger player if he starts to pay attention to his opponent' s possibilities as well as his own. Our next try at this same position shows the amateur doing much better. (62) � � � ls � .n � ts 11 � 1550-Silman. White to play. 155 0: "Black has a pawn majority on the queenside and in the center. White has pressure on the c-file. Black is down the Exchange. His pawns are on the same color as his Bishop so he will want to do something about that. Even though Black is down the Exchange, if he can keep the game closed and not allow the Rooks to be activated, he will have a good position. If Black can get his Bishop to d3, he will stand very well and White may have to sacrifice a Rook to get rid of it. White, on his end, will use his kingside majority by trading Queens. He will also prevent Black from activating his Bishop. If he can open up files for his Rooks, he will win. " Another excellent breakdown of the position. Notice how White considered some of Black's ideas too. l.Qc5 1550: "Centralizing my Queen and challenging his. Since Black's Queen is his most active piece, it's a good idea for me to trade it." I like his logic. In general, it is always good to trade off the opponent's superior pieces. However, in this case White could
MAT E R I A L / 155
have used his Rooks in conjunction with his Queen to eventually create an attack against the enemy King. Another point that may make White want to retain the Queens is the fact that the Black King is now free to run to the center and help hold things together. With the Queens on, the Kings would both stay at home. 1 . . .Qxc5

1550: "Must move my Rook since I want to double on the c file. I will play Rc3, which allows the doubling and defends e3 and allows for attacks like Ra3."
3.Rc3 c5
1550: "White wants to challenge Black's pawns. Black has opened up the diagonal for his Bishop so White wants to move his Rook on fl; at the same time he also wants to protect his pawn on f4." So both amateurs (1000 and 1550) allowed Black to advance his pawn to c5. In this case, White noticed the' possibility but just allowed it to happen. You don't have to let your opponents do what they want. Stop them!
4.g3?
Absolutely horrible. White was worried about moving his fl Rook since an eventual . . . d4 would undermine his pawn on f4. By fixing his gaze on random will-o-the-wisps (I am reminded of a deer transfixed by the headlights of a car), he forgets about more important factors that are about to hit him on the head. 4.Rdl would have been much better. 4 . . . Bb5 1550: "That is what I was trying to avoid! Well . . . it's too late to do anything about it now. White's pressure is on the c-file so I'll play Rfcl when both my Rooks are safe from the enemy." It's becoming clear that the most common error that the amateur makes (in any situation) is to ignore the opponent's possibilities. Only when a direct threat (real or imagined) appears on the board do they respond, though this response tends to be filled with panic.

It's interesting to watch White play a very thoughtful idea on one turn and then do some lazy "pass" on the next. Instead of this useless time-waster (where is the King going? I'm sure that White has no idea), he had a couple of moves that deserved consider ation. For example, 8.Ra3! a6 9.Ra5 ties Black down to the defense of his pawns, and 8.Rbl!? Bxa2 9.Ral Bc4 10.Rxa7 with a Rook on the seventh and the threat of Rc7 is also possible.

I had told him in the past that a Rook ending with three versus two pawns (or two vs.

Tips * Once you learn how to break down the imbalances in a position, you have to practice coming up with a plan based on these factors. * Use this same understanding of the imbalances to figure out what the opponent should be doing and then make some effort to stop his plans (unless you are sure your plans will come to fruition first). * Don't ignore your opponent's threats or ideas. Just because you have a superior or even winning position doesn't mean there is nothing for your opponent to do! * You must also avoid getting into a place where all you do is worry about your opponent's intentions. Then you will spend the game reacting to his moves and will almost surely lose. * Avoid the quick, lazy moves that all of us are prone to on occasion. A lazy, ill-considered move often turns out to be the losing blunder.

* A material advantage doesn't just win by itself. You have to make use of the extra wood and demon strate its usefulness. A Bishop or a Knight can easily beat a Rook if the Rook doesn't find a useful file. Point-count chess is a useful guide but it doesn't mean anything if you don't prove why your numeri cal superiority gives you an advantage. * Basic endgame knowledge is very important. Rules like Rooks belong behind passed pawns are knowledge that everyone of every class must have! In Qur next example, we see that owning a material advantage doesn't mean that you can ignore the positional factors that are normally so important in any given game. Often a small material edge (like an extra pawn) can be used as endgame insurance but has no enormous meaning right away. In this case, you must play to earn new advantages, i.e. , space, superior minor pieces, etc. (64) ii I: • • .i. a j.• i i: i . . ., ts t;j· ts ii...t· � 'iV ' Silman-Blankenau, National Open 1989.

White has won a pawn and could easily fall asleep with the thought that his game will win itself. How many prom[sing positions are lost in this way? Since the extra pawn is not going to make itself felt for a long time, White must work hard to insure that other positional factors will be in his favor. The most glaring thing about the position is the fact that Black has two Bishops. What are the rules for this type of situation? Going back to the chapter on minor pieces, we see that the side with the Bishop and Knight should trade off one of the enemy Bishops and create a Bishop versus Knight position. Then you must concentrate on making your Knight superior tD the enemy Bishop. With this in mind, White comes up with a detailed plan designed to make his Knight as good or better than any Bishop.

White might be able to use the weak b6-square and c5 is another potential target. Black h.as an ideal square on d5, though White could exchange pieces there." reminded him that this was the wrong strategy. In a past lesson I had taught him that the way to beat isolated d-pavvns is to trade off allthe minor pieces and then double on t:he d pawn with a Queen and Rook. The lack of minor pieces vvould t_ake away all the isolated d-pawn's dynamic strength and t:urn it into a pure weakness.

Tips * When playing against an isolated d-pawn, trade off all the minor pieces and the pawn's weaknesses will come to light (no attacking chances for the player with the isolated pawn, while the remaining Queen and Rooks will be able to put strong pressure against the pawn). * Even if you win material, you must not forget to read the imbalances and create a plan.
DEVELOPMENT
AND
INITIATIVE
Development and initiative are almost invisible-they don't have anything to do with territory, nor do they revolve around pawn structure or any particular weakness. Instead, these terms belong in the mysterious realm of dynamics, compared to the statics that most of our other imbalances correspond to. A static advantage is a positionally motivated imbalance. It's long-lasting, and can be used immediately or later in the game. Material is a static advantage, as are weak pawns, weak squares and, of course, extra territory. A dynamic advantage is composed of something less tangible and permanent. Here concepts such as timing, tactical vision and playing with verve become important. The goal with a dynamic advantage is to make quick and energetic use of it, in the hopes of trading in the temporary activity for a permanent static edge or a quick knockout. 1 6 7
1 6 8 I T H E AMA T E U R'S M I N D
The two dynamic advantages we will discuss here are devel opment and initiative. D eve l o p m e n t A lead in development is easy to spot. Simply put, you have more pieces out than your opponent. Of course, normally you would expect the other side to get the rest of his pieces into play over time. That is why a development lead is a temporary advantage; you only have a few moves until it disappears! Because of that, you must make immediate use of it or you will end up empty handed. How is this done? What is the goal? The following rules should clarify these points: RULE 1 - A lead in development usually means that you must start some sort of agg ressive act. Quiet play puts no pressure on the opponent and will allow him to get the rest of his forces out. (66) �

At the very least, you will keep his King stuck in the middle and make hint suffer for a long time to come. RULE 4 - A closed position often nullifi es a lead in development because the blocked files stop you from effecting any real penetration. If you have a big lead in development and think you can blast the
1 7 2 / T H E AMAT E U R ' S M I N D
pawns out of the way, then by allmeans give it a try. However, more often than not, the side with the deficit in development will find that he has ample time to cure this problem if the central situation is locked up. A common opening that leads to a closed center is 1.d4 Nf6

If you start an attack and win material (or get the two Bishops in an open position, or leave him with weak pawns, etc.) by the time he gets his forces out, then you are in possession of a fine static advan tage.

In diagram 68, White could attempt to make m e of his development lead and try to attack in some way, but why not grab material with 1.Bxf7+ Kxf7 2.Qc4+ followed by Qxc6 with a solid extra pawn? This would give White something to use for the rest of the game. I n itiat ive When you have control of the game, you are said to possess the initiative. The initiative can be based on static or dynamic factors. For example, if you are attacking a weak pawn (a static plus) and your opponent is reduced to a passive defense, you have the initiative. You would still own the initiative if you have a poor pawn structure but your lead in development gives you an attack (this time you have an initiative based on dynamics). In general, top players look upon the initiative vith great favor; it is always advantageous to have the initiat:ive. The question is, will you be able to retain it and what was the price you paid to acquire it? For example, you may have sacrificed a pawn to take control of the game (the initiative). Will your opponent eventually be able to equalize (when his extra pawn might take on enormous importance), or will your initiative lead to gains that are greater than the sacrificed material?

The position in diagram 69 comes about after the moves 1.e4 c5 2.d4 cxd4 3.c3 dxc3 4.Nxc3 (the Smith-Morra Gambit in the Sicilian Defense). Why did White sacrifice a pawn? He does gain a lead in development, but in this case Black expects to eventually catch up. The real reason White made the offer was to create two open files and a space advantage. Of course, this particular gambit is considered somewhat unsound at the top levels, but the concept is a good one: Always fight to take control of the game. Of course, if you can create static advantages and also retain the initiative then you have the best of both worlds. However, it's often a tradeoff, one kind of advantage for another. For example, if you are about to get pushed around, why not give up material (in trade for the initiative) and try to become master of your own fate? The example in the diagram is somewhat extreme. White immediately goes after the initiative and feels that a pawn is a small price to pay. However, why should White give anything away? Why not fight for the initiative by positional means (grab bing tactical possibilities if they arise) and attempt to get it all at no cost whatsoever? Though most gambits don't really work in the professional ranks (White is happy to try and make use of his extra move), amateurs can learn a lot from initiative-seeking pawn sacrifices. Ultimately, though, you have to be able to do both: mastering positional (static) ideas on one hand and making use of dynamic strategies on the other. • • • • • An eight year old student-rated about 1 100 and visiting me for the first time-showed me a game which he lost to an opponent (another youngster) with a rating of just 800.

He is not aware of the possible battle between the minor pieces-we know this because he's not doing anything to make his Bishops active-and he is letting the enemy Knight remain on its active post. Black is also not aware of the danger of leaving one's King in the center for too long. Once you castle and get your King to safety, you can play for a long time. However, if your King is sitting in the middle, then you might get nuked at any moment. Finally, Black is not aware of the dangers inherent in a lack of development. At the beginning of this game, he bought the two Bishops for the price of development. Now it's time to replenish

However, Black is a long way from being castled so I'm not sure if he can make use of these things. White has a space advantage on the kingside and in the center, plus he's way ahead in development. I also see a possible weak square on c6. White should break open the center by any means possible. Even a pawn sacrifice would be justified if it meant getting to that King." I really like what White said about breaking through the center by any means possible; that is just the type of attitude that I am trying to cultivate. However, when it came down to particulars he had surprisingly little to say. That's because he started to concen trate on his attacked Knight. Notice how he never gets too far away from this defe!lsive thought.
9.c4 Qd7
1400: "I will bring my Queen up to d3 where it will defend c4. This move also connects my Rooks." I prefer 10 .a4 followed by 1 1 .e5, as seen in the original game. White has become so concerned about defending b5 that he never gets his dreams for an attack started. A large part of chess success is based on attitude. If you decide that your advantage consists of something that demands quick and vigorous play and you insist on moves from yourself that
D E V E L O P M E N T A N D I N I T IAT I V E / 1 7 9
conform to those particular needs, then you will be a fearsome opponent. However, if you pay too much attention to the enemy's threats, then your mind will click into this defensive mode and you will become sensitive to every threat or non-threat that arises. You will start playing a game of reaction and your own ideas will never have a chance for expression.
10.Qd3 cxd4
1400: "Now the recapture dumps a piece to . . .e6-e5. I'll play e5. This opens the center but blocks my Bishop." He has already lost the game mentally. If someone's King is in the middle, then feel free to sacrifice a pawn or even a piece in order to get your army to it. In this case, White should play l 1.Qxd4! e5 (the move he feared. Simply good for White is 1 1 . . .Bxb5 12.cxb5 e5 13.Qd5) 12.Nxe5! (blasting his way through) 12 . . .dxe5 13.Qxe5+ Be7 14.Nc7+ and White regains his sacrificed piece. White didn't see this because he stopped looking when he saw the fork by . . .e6-e5. This is how blind spots are created; we see a move or two ahead, notice a problem, and completely stop looking. Instead, we should look one or two moves ahead, stop, and treat this future situation as our starting position. When you analyze from this new starting position you will often be amazed at what you find! ll.e5 d4 Notice how White has been reacting to Black's threats for the last several moves. In chess there are two wars being waged: one is on the physical chessboard. The other is the subtler battle of mind versus mind. In the present contest, White is doing whatever Black tells him to do. This means that Black has already won the mental part of the fight.

No words or thought; he just played it right away. He's still reacting to everything Black does. 12 ...dxc4 }3.bxc4 Bc5

Now White has a permanent weakness on c4 and he has also given Black use of the c5-square. 1400: "I want to take on d4. " He tried 14.Nfxd4 Bxb5 15.Be3?? Cl5.Qe4) and didn't notice that he was a piece down. I pointed this out to him and had him do something else. 1 400: "That's not good! I'll just keep up the pressure by moving my Rook to dl." White is making things easy on Black. He has to get control of the game before Black develops his Knight and castles; he has to make something happen before the long-term disadvantages of the White position make themselves felt. White should play
14.Nd6+ Bxd6 15.exd6 when the pawn on d6 is quite strong and
the pawn on d4 will quickly fall. Remember: Chess is a game where you come up with an idea that supposedly improves the plusses in the position, then you do everything you can to implement that idea. In the present case, White is just doing what his opponent wants him to do.
14.Rad1 Ne7
1400: "I want to trade one of my Knights for a Bishop to get rid of his Bishop pair. I'll do this by Nd2-b3xc5." He's lost all sense of reality and reverts to rules used only in static situations. Taking the Bishop on c5 only helps Black retain his extra pawn on d4. White should have taken his pawn back by

It was becoming clear to me that mental toughness (this is something that can be learned) is a major part of chess strength. You have to insist on accomplishing your goals and you can't allow anything to distract you from this path.

The next game is still from the same position, but this student's collapse comes even faster. (72) 1 300-Silman. White to play. 1300: "My Bishop is undefended on f4 and my Knight is attacked and pinned. White has a space advantage in the center but this is evened out by Black's space edge on the queenside. I have a lead in development while Black has only one piece out. I'm probably just slightly better due to my development, though I'm bothered by my pinned Knight on bS. I would like to move it to Safety but then he would take my Rook. I'll go to d3 with my Queen. Then if he takes my Knight I can recapture with check." 1300 didn't talk like a man who has faith in his position. Notice how he really hated the fact that his Knight was pinned, and he even was worried (unjustifiably, I assure you!) about his unde fended Bishop on f4. Evidently, White doesn't realize that a huge lead in development on an open board takes precedence over most static principles.

An interesting move. Now the Bishop on a6 can hang to tactics based on Nc7+ or Nxd6+ . 9 . . . cxd4

1 300: " I might be able to play 10.Nxd6+ when h e gets my Knight and I get his Bishop. Wait! After 10.Nxd6+ Bxd6 1 1 . Qxa6 I lose a piece to 11 . . .Bxf4. I'll just take back on d4. " Very interesting. White faces his first tough decision and he promptly falls apart. When you are trying to make use of a dynamic edge you should take your time and look long and hard for a knockout. This doesn't mean that you are playing only for mate. Far from it! A superior endgame, the win of a pawn, a huge positional plus; all of these things are good value for your dynamic dollar. In the present situation, White should have played 10.Bxd6! Bxd6 l 1.Nxd6+ Qxd6 12.Qxa6 when threats like
13.Qa4+ or 13.Radl guarantee that White will pick up the d-pawn
and be a solid pawn to the good.
10.Nfxd4 e5
1 300: "I didn't see that at all. I better attack." White more or less just gives up. I would have been happy if he hunkered down and tried hard to find a way out (it didn't mater if he actually found a saving idea, I just wanted to see some effort. lf you don't make an effort, you won't get results). Instead, he took a few seconds and makes a one-move threat. As it turns out, White had the strong 11.Qc4, threatening both
12.Qc6+ and 12.Nc7+. Then l l. . . Rc8 is met by 1 2.Qa4!. However,
it's impossible to find a game-saving shot if you don't look for it!

In this game, White had an idea but noticed that it didn't work at the last moment. Instead of calmly reassessing the situation, he panicked and went berserk!

It is interesting to note that the amateurs took note of the development leads and realized that it was a favorable factor, but they were not able to make use of this advantage. Ti p s * Figure out if the position is a dynamic one or a static one. If it's dynamic, then you must play with tremen dous energy. * Once you decide on a goal (for example: you want to break through in the center) you must take as long as necessary to accomplish it (on the clock and on the board). A static goal might take twenty moves. A dynamic goal calls for some sort of instant result-this means that speed is extremely important. If it takes you forty minutes to figure out how to do what you want done, then take forty minutes! * Never let the opponent dominate you mentally! If you notice that you are meekly reacting to every thing he does, you must snap yourself out of your trance and fight to establish some sort of psychic control. * Castle quickly! When your King is safe, you can do what you want and play without fear of a mating surprise. If you see a King in the center, do every thing you can to blast things open and execute it. No subtleties here, just pure brutality!

Our next example shows what happens when one of the greatest attackers of all time gets his hands on the initiative: He never lets up until the opponent is dead. Even more interesting is how he creates the initiative in the first place. It's almost as if he treats his opponent like a sheep-- he herds him in a certain direction and the opponent obeys the commands given to him. (73) Alekhine-Marshall, Baden-Baden 1925. White to play. The main imbalance in this position is created by the mutual pawn majorities. White has a central majority and Black has a majority of pawns on the queenside. Seeing that the key to his success will be whether or not he can make use of the power of his majority, Alekhine takes immediate steps to get his pawns moving.
1.Qd2
A flexible move. White prepares to make use of his kingside majority with f2-f4. He can also castle queenside. 1 . . .Bd7 Since White's pawn majority influences the center and kingside, Black hopes to place his King on the other side of the board. Naturally, White takes immediate steps to prevent this.

A very fine idea. Black is prevented from castling queenside and the Black Queen is also kept out of the d4-square. We will see how Black made use of this square in the games that follow. 2 . . . Bc6?1 Black decides to castle kingside, but it is rarely wise to castle into the strength of the enemy. In this case, the kingside is White's strength due to his majority of pawns. Better was 2 . . .Qa5, when Black could safely castle on the queenside.
3.O-O-O
With his King safely tucked away on this side of the board, White can advance his kingside pawns without being worried about weakening his King's protection. 3 ...
O-O
When you see Kings that are castled on opposite sides, it usually denotes a wild struggle where both players strive for an attack on the enemy monarch. However, in this case Black will hardly be able to strike a blow. Why? Because the Black majority is unable to take part in the attack. White gets to land the first blow and he keeps on punching till the opponent falls to the canvas. This type of active control is known as the initiative.

This powerful performance by the legendary Alekhine was accomplished due to his insight into the opponent's possibilities. He didn't just note that his kingside majority was strong. He also took into consideration the opponent's counterplay and made a D E V E LO P M E N T A N D I N l l l A T I V E I 1 87 point of first preventing it. After that, the enemy never had a chance to do anything but defend. Now let's see how mortals play the position that Alekhine handled so magnificently. (74) 1500-Silman. White to play. 1500: "White has a space advantage. Black has the more active Queen but it could also tum out to be a target. White can activate his majority with tempo by playing for f2-f4. How do I do this? I'll castle and play for a quick f4. " White, to his credit, notices the advantages that an active central majority can bring. Unfortunately, he neglects to take Black's plans into account.

1 8 8 I T H E A M A T E U R ' S M I N D
5.Qf3 Qxf3
6.Rxf3 Rd2
1500: "Ugh. Have to defend my Bishop." Ever since Black placed his Queen on d4 and castled queenside, White has forgotten his own plans and done nothing but worry about the threats of his opponent. This all stemmed from White's refusal to look for Black's plan on the first move. Knowing your own plan isn't enough, you also have to know what your opponent intends to do! We decided to end the game at this point. Next I tested this position on a slightly stronger opponent. (75) .I. .i. �;'i' • j. j. � .. 1700-Silman. White to play. 1700: "White has a pawn majority on the kingside. Black's pieces are farther advanced and Black has a bit less development. White's pawn majority gives him a space advantage on the kingside so Black would be well-advised to castle long. White will castle short and prepare f2-f4." 1700 realized that Black should not step into the brunt of White's onrushing pawns. This is excellent. However, like the student before him, White fails to notice the potential weakness of the dark-squares in the center. This seems to be a typical failing of the amateur player: he can see tactical threats to win material or go
D E V E LOPM E N T A N D I N I T I A T I V E I 189
after the King, but he has real trouble seeing that a square can also be a target.
1.O-O Be6
1700: "If I play f4, he can check me with . . .Qd4, but then he has to move his Queen because he can easily lose it to a Bishop discovery on b5. He could also check me on c5 when his Queen might be safer. I could just move out of the way, though, and continue my attack." This student tends towards excessive optimism. While confi dence is an important thing to have, you also need a touch of realism. Like 1 500 before him, 1700 is not really giving the possibilities of the opponent a thorough examination. The initiative in open positions will often go to the player who is first to control an open central file. In the Alekhine game, White went ahead with his pawn expansion only after stopping any counterplay on the d-file.
2.f4 Qd4+
1700: "Looks risky to me." At this point White is transfixed by his threat to win Black's Queen by Bb5+.
3.Khl O-O-O
1700: "Now he's attacking my Bishop and has stopped my threat of Bb5+. I can move it to c2 or play Rf3."
4.Bc2
Did you notice that we've reached the same position as in the previous game, with the insignificant exception of the King's placement on h 1 instead of h2? Perhaps we have stumbled onto something important. Per haps the amateur typically has some S<?rt of idea about what he wishes to achieve but rarely takes an honest look at the opponent's plans.

5.Rel Qf2
6.Qcl
He moved quickly and without thought. 6 ...Rd2, 0-1. Well, that was a disaster for White! Note how routine play keeps giving Black the initiative in these games. Now compare them to Alekhine's play and you will get a greater appreciation of two things: how he stopped Black's counterplay before it began and how he claimed the initiative for himself by making the most of his kingside pawn majority. The mixture of prophylaxis and aggression was quite impressive, don't you agree? In our next example (still using the Alekhine position), we move up the food-chain a bit and test the skills of an "A" class player. (76) 1800-Silman. White to play. 1800: "I like White. He has his minor pieces out and he has a pawn controlling the center. He has both the d-file and the half-open c-file to work with. He has a pawn majority on the kingside while Black has a majority on the queenside. We
D EV E LOP M E N T A N D I N I T I A T I V E I 1 9 1
have to kill his majority and get ours going. How do we do this? 1 .Qb3 slows down his development, but he just goes 1 . . .b6 and fianchettoes. At some point, I could play b4 stopping his pawns. I can't do this at the moment so I'll just castle and prepare to get my pawns going by f2-f4." As a higher-rated player, 1800 looked at more than his predecessors. Nevertheless, his error is basically the same. By seeing the game as some mad race between rival majorities, he fails to take into account other possibilities for Black and fails victim to the pressure on the d-file that the others ran afoul of.
1.O-O Be6
1800: "He has a pin coming up but there is nothing he can do with it yet. I'll get my majority rolling. " Like 1700, White sees Black's first move but discounts its usefulness.
2.f4 Qd4+
3.Khl O-O-O
1800: "I'm pinned and I don't see any counterplay for myself." Here we go again! All of these players saw the punch coming but refused to give it credence until their teeth were knocked out! How do players of C-A strength avoid this type of reversal? First, you have to work much harder at the board than these guys did! They gave the position just a cursory examination and paid the price. As we're discovering, it's critically important to come up with an aggressive plan for yourself (based on the positive aspects of your position, of course), but you must also figure out what the opponent is going to do and strive to cross his plans. This is done by determining that your plan is faster (which means you can ignore his stuff altogether), or by simply stopping him from doing what he wants to do.
4.Bc2
1800: "I need to consolidate and this does it." 4 ...Qe3 1800: "He's in my position! I don't know what to do."

5.Qf3 Qxf3
6.Rxf3 Rd2
1800: "Black stands better. I need to sacrifice a pawn and get out of the bind." White is a little too eager to give up material. Your position may be unpleasant but you must hold on tight and refuse to give up more than is necessary.

So panic leads to the loss of material. The calm 7.Rcl was much better. 7 . . . Rxb2 and we stopped the game. Ready to do this one more time? Let's go to the strong expert class and see if someone of this strength can handle the position with any degree of proficiency. (77) 2100-Silman. White to play. 2100: "The major imbalance is a kingside majority versus a queenside majority. If White can break the blockade on e5 and push his pawn to that square, his Bishop will be more active and his pawns will push the Black pieces backwards. "Of course, this sounds good but it's not so easy to accomplish. On 1.O-O Black can play 1 . . . Nh5 and create a
D E V E LO P M E N T A N D I N IT I A T I V E I 1 9 3
blockade on f4. My dark squares would then be conquered. I have three moves to consider: 1 .O-O with the idea of f4. I already found a good reply to this; l .Ne2, giving up the b pawn. I don't think I can open up the center fast enough to justify this sacrifice; l.Qc2 with the idea of Ne2. This covers the f4 and d4 squares. Finally, 1.Qd2 is also possible but Qc2 gives extra protection to the e-pawn. "From Black's point of view: he wants to retain his blockade and prevent f4. He doesn't want to castle queenside because there are several open files. Black could try to work on the e4-pawn but that might be slow. He should probably try to use his queenside majority and get his King to safety with . . .
O-O.
"For White, I like 1.Qc2 because there are potential attacks on the c-pawn." That was nicely done! He was off on his assessment concern ing the correct location for Black's King, but his efforts to take the dark-squares away from Black are highly praiseworthy (though inaccurate). Notice how he also looked for ways that Black could fight against his plans (1 .O-O being met by . . .NhS). This was something that the C-A players didn't do.
1.Qc2 Bd7
2100: "Now I'll take away those squares on f4 and d4." Notice how the other players never even mentioned the existence of "squares." Any class player will make great strides if he realizes that the control of individual squares is as important as any other strategy in the game.
2.Ne2 Bc6
2100: "Now f3 or 3.Nc3 will make me look stupid so f4 is forced."
3.f4 Qa5+
2100: "I knew he was going there. If 4.Qd2, he can simply trade. My best option is 4.Nc3; the Knight's already done its job in allowing me to play f4. After 4.Nc3, I can also castle queenside and get my kingside majority into play."
4.Nc3 O-O-O
2100: "Now I have to decide between queenside castling and eS. It's risky to play in the center when your King is still

6.Bxe4 Bxe4 7.Qxe4 Rhe8."
5.O-O-O
Though White's play was not the very best, he came up with a logical plan and this sufficed to give him a good position with a safe King and an active central majority. We stopped the game at this point. Ti p s * Don't become entranced with your own plans. You must also take note of the opponent's possibilities and gauge just how dangerous they really are. * Part of your plan can be the prevention of the opponent's goals. For example, you can be playing to win a weak pawn but can take time out to prevent his Knight from reaching a strong central outpost. * In an open position, the first person to dominate an open central file will usually gain the initiative. * The initiative will usually go to the first person who turns his plan into a reality. During my years of teaching experience, I have noticed that nothing freaks out the amateur player more than the threat of an attack against his King. Though the amateur's play on the queenside or in the center may be highly promising, when the opponent goes "boo" to his King, all thoughts about his own plans are quickly forgotten and his pieces rush to the kingside in an effort to defend their leader. When you lose such a game, you aren't losing because of the opponent's kingside attack. (which is usually more imagined than real). You are losing because you've given up on your own plans, and this lack of direc tion allows the enemy to safely do anything he wishes to do.
D EV E LO P M E N T A N D ] N l T IA T I VE I 195
This leads us to the following simple but effective rule: When players are attacking on opposite wings, it's inlpcrtant to follow your plans with unerring devotion. Certain defensive moves are acceptable, but the first person to crack and go into defensive mode will most likely end up as the loser. Why? Because the attacking side can then take his time and build up his forces to his heart's content, secure in the knowledge that his opponent has ceased to make threats of his own. The following two games both show cases where White (the amateur) is given a position with very promising queenside play. Will our amateurs panic in the face of Black's kingside counterat tack? If they do panic, does this mean that such a reaction is typical of most amateurs, or is it simply a matter of style and individual temperament? Perhaps the games will provide an answer to these questions. (78) .. •• • .i. 'ii.. • -·1: • • • . ·� • � ft) �.8 t:iJ �

:1 it' 1:1 ·� 1400-Silman. Queen's Gambit Declined. White to play. The starting moves were: 1.d4 d5 2.c4 e6 3.Nc3 Nf6 4.cxd5 exd5 5.Bg5 Be7 6.e3 c6 7.Bd3 O-O 8.Nf3 Nbd7 9.O-O Re8. This, the Exchange Variation of the Queen's Gambit Declined, features one of the most useful positional ideas in chess: the Minority Attack. The beauty of this plan is that Whi:e is able to implement a strategy that goes beyond the middlegame, right into the endgame. The idea is to play Rbl followed by bl-b4-b5 and
1 9 6 I T H E A MAT E U R ' S M I N D
bxc6 (White is attacking a majority of pawns with a minority of pawns, hence the name) when Black will be left with a weak pawn on c6 that will bother him forever. Does this mean that Black is doomed to defend passively and hope for a draw? Of course not! It's important to note that Black's pawns are pointing towards the kingside. The pawn-pointing theory (discussed ear lier in the book) states that Black should play in the direction his pawns point, so this means that Black must try to generate a kingside attack. Thus the battle lines are drawn: White will play on the queenside, making use of the pawn weaknesses that his minority attack creates there (this gives him a long-range, static advantage. As a result, endgames are favorable to White). Black's play will come on the kingside (Black hopes for a middlegame decision). · My students in these two games were given lectures about the minority attack. Would they be able to integrate that information into an actual game scenario? 1400: "The position looks even. White's light-squared Bishop appears to be pretty good. Looks like Ne5 followed by f4 with a kingside attack might do well here. Black has a queenside pawn majority and White has a majority on the kingside. This means that White has the possibility of using a minority attack on the queenside. The other plan with Ne5 is interesting but Black has a lot of pieces aimed at the kingside and his pawns point there also. White's pawns aim at the queenside so a minority attack must be correct. I'm considering Rbl followed by b2-b4 starting a minority attack. I'm not sure if that is correct or if a3 followed by b4 is better."
10.a3?1
I was worried when he jumped on the Ne5 bandwagon, but it pleased me when he realized that this could be a chance to make use of the minority attack (something he'd never used before). The best move is 10.Qc2, which gives added support to the e4-square and connects the Rooks. When the time comes for the b4-advance, though, correct is Rbl instead of a3 since after an eventual b2-b4-b5 and bxc6 the Rook will be nicely placed on the open b-fiie. Another problem with 10.a3 is that after b4 Black can play . . . a6 when White must move the a-pawn a second time by
D E V E L O P M E N T AND I N I T IAT I V E I 1 9 7
a3-a4 if he wishes to get in the desired b4-b5 advance. Note that Rbl followed by b4 allows White to advance his a-pa.wn (if needed) to a4 in just one move. 10 ... Ne4 1400: "Looks like I have to trade Bishops by Bxe7. By doing that I'm allowing Black to back up his Knight. Due to this,
10.Bf4 is possible. Trading the Bishops probably helps me
on the queenside with my minority attack so I will go ahead and snap it off. So far White is thinking only of his minority attack. This is a good sign! He has a plan and he wants to implement it. ll.Bxe7 Qxe7 1400: "I'm now concerned about his Knight on e4 and an . . .f7-f5 advance on the kingside. How do I get rid of his Knight? Nevertheless, my pieces are posted towar<il an advance on the queenside and I don't see how he can kill me right away so let's advance!" Here we see the start of 1400's fatal weakness as a. chess player: he becomes so worried about possible threats to his King that he starts to forget about his own ideas and even misses elementary tactical tricks (though, to his credit, he resisted the immediate temptation to panic and stays focused on his minority attack). At this point 1400 played 12.b4?? which hangs his face to 12 . . . Nxc3. I had him take the move over. 1400: "I can play 12.Qc2 to guard c3 and put pressure on e4."
12.Qc2 Nf8
1400: "Black is definitely setting his sights on a fierce attack against my King. In order to counteract that I can play Nce2- g3." White's fear of being mated has left all his previous dreams of a minority attack in the dust. From this point on, he plays a fearful defensive game and hands the initiative to Black. He didn't realize that the time White takes to "defend" himself allows Black all the tempi he needs to set a real attack in motion.

13.Ne2 Ng6
1400: "Now I'll bring my Knight around and get more protection for my King." White is now so preoccupied with thoughts of defense that he no longer entertains any hopes at all of continuing his queenside play.
14.Ng3
The game was stopped here. Though the move isn't bad in itself, White's reasoning is a disaster waiting to happen! White has reduced himself to just reacting to the opponent's ideas and is getting so confused about stopping all of the enemy's possi bilities (real or imagined) that he has become afraid to move anything at all. In the next game, I played pretty much the same position but this time I brought in my ever-confident 1700 student. Would he bravely follow his own plans or would he, like 1400 before him, succumb to the whims of fear and panic? 1700-Silman. Queen's Gambit Declined. White to play.

However, how long will he retain this enthusi asm? ll.Bxf6 Bxf6
12.b4 Be7
Seeing that his Bishop is doing nothing on f6, Black wants to redirect it to d6 where it will menace the White King. 1700: "He's attacking my pawn. I can now push my pawn up or guard it with the Rook. If I play bS then he can try . . . cS. So maybe it's better to guard it first." He didn't figure out why I played . . . Be7 (other than to attack his b4-pawn) and he didn't seem to care what my plan was. We also get to see a bit of laziness present itself: he notices the possibility of answering b5 with . . . cS but doesn't take time out to see if that idea works for Black. After 13.bS c5? 14.dxcS BxcS
15.Radl Black would experience real problems with his weak d

13.Rabl Bd6

15.bxc6 bxc6
1700: "I can bring my Knight back to e2 where it guards the kingside and uncovers my Queen on c6." Now that a weakness has been created on c6, White can spend a little time shoring up his kingside. However, great care must be taken to insure that his own threats on the queenside never let up (if White can get Black to react to queenside threats, then Black's attack will lose its momentum). He must also make sure that he doesn't fall into a defensive frame of mind. t6.Ne2 Instead of this somewhat passive reassignment of the Knight, better would have been 16.BfS! (since endgames favor White, trades can only make the first player happy. In this case, the c8- Bishop was aiming at White's King so this equals one less attacking piece for Black) 16 . . .Rh6 17.Bxc8 Cl 7.h3!? followed by
18.Rfcl may be better. With the light-squared Bishops gone,

Note that 21 .NxdS! is also possible (21 . . .QgS 22.Nc3 with the threat of 23.Ne4 retains the pawn). I'll leave it to the reader to decide if Black can get any compensation after the chop on dS. I admit this is long-winded, but the point should be obvious. Even in the face of a kingside attack you must keep a clear head and not lose sight of your goals (like in this instance where trading
D E V E LO P M E N T A N D I N I T IAT I V E I 2 0 1
pieces is good for White since most endgames favor him). After all, White owns a static advantage, while Black's play is based on dynamics. 16 . . . Rh6 1700: "I can't take on c6 due to . . . Bxh2+ winning my Queen. I should block his Bishop on d6 by 17.Ng3 or 17.Nf4."

White first played Ng3 and just before letting go placed it on f4 saying, "Here is better. " Naturally, this type of last second change of plan can only lead to trouble. If you touch a piece and suddenly have a change of heart, put the piece down, take a deep breath and rethink the position. You do have to move the piece you touch but at least you can make sure that you place it on a good square. 17 . . .g5 1700: "Attacking my Knight. I have to move it when he can continue to advance via . . . g5-g4. Then I will play NeS ." White's mista�e on the 17m move has given Black several free moves and a firm grip on the initiative.

The game was stopped here. For those that have alway wondered what the initiative is, this game provides an excellen example. White was forced to deal with all the Black threats anc was not able even to think of continuing his own play on th� queenside. Ti ps * Always be aware of your opponent's plans and ideas. * Don't panic in the face of a kingside attack. Size up his real threats, make defensive moves when needed and continue with your own plans. * Follow your plans with gusto. Be devoted to your plan and it will serve you well. * Don't play with fear in your heart. If you play with courage, the worst thing that can happen to you is a loss. Since we will all lose many games in our lifetime, we might as well go down with honor and make every game as instructive as possible. Playing passively and getting routed is no fun at all and teaches you nothing. * Worry, confusion and hasty moves leads to gross blunders. If you find your mind fogging up, sit back, relax and take a fresh look at the position. * Chess is a game of willpower. Don't let the opponent's will dominate yours. Stick to your plans and don't allow him to distract you from them. * Take nothing for granted. Don't feel or hope that some line is good or bad. Make sure it is! * The best defense is a good offense. When you have to defend, try to make a move that also furthers your own plans.
MANY
IMBALANCES,
ONE B OARD
The vast majority of chess games contain battles between several different types of imbalances. One person may have high hopes for his advantage in space and superior pawn structure while the opponent will insist that his two Bishops and greater activity is what really counts. Often it's not clear which particular imbalance will triumph, but no one doubts that the first player who stops trying to make use of these positive attributes will allow the opponent to dominate. Though it's important to be aware of the general rules concerning the imbalances, it's equally important to be conscious of the fact that one rule might negate or strengthen another. When contemplating the imbalances you have and imbal ances you would like to create, always make sure that they complement each other. For example: you may have two Bishops
2 0 4 I T H E A M A T E U R ' S M I N D
(vs. a Bishop and Knight), a passed pawn and the chance to gain extra space by advancing and locking the pawns. The desire to gain space may be great, but will this decision aid or hurt your Bishops (remember that they don't like closed positions)? Will the passed pawn be useful or will it make the enemy Knight (which might sit in front of the passer and act as a blockader) stronger? • • • • • Our first example of several imbalances interacting with each other is obviously in White's favor. He clearly enjoys the superior pawn structure and he also has a fine Knight versus a poor Bishop. Is this enough to win? Yes, White should win, but the process is far from easy.

We have seen that, in top flight chess, the diagrammed position is considered to be a matter of technique, but at the amateur level virtually anything can happen. Let's see what kind of mistakes the amateur makes while trying to realize his advantage. (81) 1467-Silman. White to play. 1 467: "My Knight is better than his bad Bishop and the open d-file is not a problem since White can easily challenge it. The queenside seems even. The only thing I can see is to play Rfdl." He saw the basics (though I was surprised that he never mentioned Black's doubled pawns) but was not sure how to make use of his advantages. In this type of position, a player should look for ideas rather than concrete moves. I certainly don't expect 1467 to come up with the plans that Alekhine laid out, but there are three things that a player of any rating can do: 1) Make each of his pieces better than, or at least equal to, their enemy counterparts; 2) If the opponent cannot do anything active, then don't rush the position; instead you should let him sit there, suffer, and beg you for
2 0 8 I T H E A M A T E U R ' S M I N D
a draw; 3) Try to make your plusses expand while making sure that his negatives don't cure themselves.

1 467: "Now, if 1 . . .Rxdl+ 2.Rxdl, White threatens Rd6 and Rd7."
1.. .Kt7
1 467: "I can check on g5 and win a pawn!" He decides that I just hung a pawn and rushes to cash in his ill gotten gains. This type of decision should be made slowly; after all, White is moving his Knight from a dominant central location and placing it on the far rim of the board. Instead of this impulsive act, White would have done well if he had simply brought his King to the center.
2.Ng5+ Ke7
1 467: "I don't know if this is good, even though it wins a pawn. " He should have figured this out before he made the check.
3.Nxh7 Bh6
White's greedy idea, which forced the Black King to the center, has left him with a poorly placed Knight.
4.h4
The only way to free his embattled Knight. White has now taken on the role of the defender-someone who must react to his opponent's will. How did this transformation take place? White failed to make his pieces better than or equal to the Black ones and he failed to make use of his fine Knight (instead, he stuck it in a ditch). 4 . . . Rh8

He lost this game because he did a couple of negative things: He allowed his proud Knight to be exchanged for the horrible Bishop, and he allowed the enemy King to become centralized. This happened because he tried to cash in his advantage too quickly. Remember: When your opponent is helpless, take your time and make sure he doesn't generate any counterplayl 1467 was so upset about losing this nice endgame that he set the same position up and insisted on trying it again.

Keep in mind that 1467 has not yet seen the Alekhine game but now, after a couple of trial runs, he is actually coming very close to the World Champion's ideas. Why the drastic change? I think he suddenly realized that his advantages are not going away and that a slow handling of the position leaves Black without any play at all. In a way, these three examples show how chess should be studied. All great players look at thousands and thousands of master games. By doing so, you see important patterns (positional and tactical) that can be emulated, you see how the opening, middlegame and endgame are all interrelated, and you get a feel for natural but strong moves. By playing the position three times, he learned a lot about its needs and secrets. His play improved enormously on the third try thanks to his newfound knowledge of this game's particular patterns.

His original idea of playing e3-e4 was horrible since it killed a square that was a potential home for his Knight and his King.

When i t comes to positions with several imbalances, humans, computers and other chess playing creatures may find themselves with differing views about who has the advantage. I recall once having a little argument with a well-known chess writer in the pages of a certain American chess magazine. In one of his books, he declared that Black stood better in the following position.
(84) I: • I.
i i .t: • • • • 8 ttJ 8 8 8 8 8 l:t � l:t White to play. I disagreed, saying that the ending was far from clear (I actually preferred White but decided to be kind). He disagreed with my disagreement and pointed out that his chess computer validated his opinion. I. . .well, we never did come to terms on this position. · Why the difference of opinion? Why would a computer be in error? This example showed me why some players and many computers run into trouble: When the heart of a position takes accepted principles and turns them inside out, many players find themselves at a loss to understand what's really going on. This means that though basic laws such as "Always capture towards the center," "Don't move the same piece twice in the opening," "Doubled pawns are bad", and "Bishops are better than Knights in open positions" are often correct, they also lead to a close-minded bigotry that can stunt the growth of just about any student of the game. Computers, of course, are even more vulnerable to this type of thing than humans are. They are given specific rules and they stick
M A N Y I M B A LA N C E S . O N E B O A R D I 2 1 5
faithfully to these dictates--often to the exclusion of everything else. We biological organisms, however, can (hopefully) go beyond this one-dimensional view. In diagram 84, we have a situation where the basic laws of chess add up to a Black advantage. He has a Bishop versus a Knight in an open position and White has three pawn islands versus Black's two. However, placing any credence in these two laws serves only to blind a player to the truth-which is that White's mass of center pawns are far more threatening than their Black counterparts (a good plan for White is a2-a4 followed by Kel -e2, Rhbl and Ke2-d3). This unwavering faith in beginning principles has harmed many players who have come to me for help. How many times have I recommended a position with doubled pawns and how many times have they cringed in horror? How often have I caught myself in this situation: During the first lesson I say, "Why did you move the same piece twice in the opening? You should know better." Then, during the next lesson I find myself pointing out how they could have gotten a strong game by breaking that rule and moving the same piece twice or even three times! This confusing state of affairs is enough to drive anyone crazy. Indeed, I have even run into cases where masters get trapped in the world of basic rules. A good example of this is the game between Beatriz Marinello and Sharon Burtman (diagram 85). (85) .. • • • • • • � � � � · � � l:t � Marinello-Burtman, U.S. Woman's Championship, 1 993.

Here the players agreed to a draw since White was exhausted from a long trip and · Black was disgusted that she had blown a winning position from the opening. At the time, the players and the tournament's other participants thought that White had the advantage and should have continued the battle. A glance shows that this is a reasonable assessment: White's Rook is on a completely open file, White's Bishop is very active, White has a queenside majority of pawns, Black has an isolated pawn on e6 and White enjoys a clearly superior King position. An impressive list, but I shocked Sharon when I declared that Black's position looked quite nice to me. What was I seeing that others didn't? Nothing at all! I just preferred to look at all the so called negatives in a positive light. Here's what I mean: > White's Bishop is indeed slicing down that hl-a8 diago nal, but what is it doing there? On the other hand the Black Knight is quite bothersome and threatens to pick up the a3-pawn by . . .Nbl . > White's Rook is on a completely open file but it is not attacking anything there. The Black Rook, though, is eyeing the morsel on c2. > White does have a queenside majority, but the purpose of such a majority is to create a passed pawn. Black's so-called weakness on e6 is in reality a tower of strength since it is already passed. Thus, I will not look at it as isolated-instead, I look at is as an active anack ing unit! > The White King is better placed than the Black one. You got me on that point!

Naturally, I immediately gave this position to a class C student and had him play me one of my patented "talk out lm.:d games." (86) 14 70-Silman White to play. 1470: "Black has an isolated pawn and a passive King. My Bishop is also dominating his Knight, though the pawn on g4 makes my Bishop bad. I think that I should be able to do something really good here; Black must be busted. I will use my superior King to march into h6 and win the h7-pawn."
1.Kg5?
By looking at the e6-pawn as a weakness, White was unable to see its dynamic potential. Something is only weak if you can attack it. Names such as "doubled" or "isolated" don't make things weak! White's best try is probably 1 .Rd6. This activates the Rook and prepares to attack the Black queenside from behind by Ra6. 1� . .e51 1470: "Oh-oh. This pawn is threatening to go to e4 , e3 and e2! Have I done something really stupid or can I stop the silly thing? I can't believe that this pawn can really go too far! I will continue with my plan and make him defend. That way he will never have the time to push the pawn."
2.Kh6
Winning the h-pawn will not worry Black. He is after a new Queen and certainly won't blink an eye at such a tiny threat. White

is making the mistake of assuming that Black will go into a panic at this first nibble. Instead, he will ignore White's King-walk and continue with his own ideas. 2 . . . e4 1470: "Giving me material. There is no turning back now; I have to take it and dare him to do his worst!" Black could have dispelled White's illusions with 2 . . . Ke6, but I felt it was more instructive to give up the h-pawn and demon strate the strength of the runner on e4.
3.Kxh7 e3
4.Rd3 Re7
We ended the game. That "weakness" on e6 took White right out of the game! The next time I gave the position to a student, I made a couple of small changes to make things look (cosmetically) even more attractive for White. Incredibly, my student insisted that Black stood better, so I found myself on the White side! (87) ,'• • (;.>�; ,, Silman-1650. White to play. 1650: "So we have an endgame with Rook and Knight versus Rook and Bishop. The question is: which is better, the Knight or Bishop? White has a queenside pawn majority.

hidden weakness on c2, so his Rook i s forced to stay o n the second rank to defend it. Black's Knight is kind of trapped on c3 so that covers the weakness at the moment. However, the threat to move it to bl and win the a3-pawn is very annoying for White. So overall, I will give the edge to Black. " I think that way because, aside from the threat of . . .Na3, Black also has three pawns to two on the kingside." Not bad at all! 1650 is not a prisoner of memorized preconcep tions and instead tries to figure out the present positio:-i in a fresh way. I decided to try to freak him out with a central King rush.

The second possibility is 3 . . .Rd5+!, a move that he looked at but rejected due to 4.Kxc3 (note that 4.Ke3 Rxd2 5 Kxd2 Nbl + wins a pawn for Black). Now Black can take advantage of the loosely guarded White Rook by 4 . . .b4+ 5.axb4 axb4+ 6.Kxb4 Rxd2 with an extra Exchange and a sure win.

Don't fall in love with these concepts and become blind to the reality of any given situation. * Every imbalance is capable of doing something positive. Don't look at a thing as negative just because it's supposed to be weak or bad. You have to ask: "Is it bad in this particular position?" * Undefended pieces can easily lead to trouble. * When pawns are racing to promote on both sldes of the board, a Bishop will usually beat out a Knight due to its ability to jump from one side of the board to another in one move.

The next game shows a battle based on very different imbalances. Both sides nurse what they have and try to make it grow but, of course, only one side's vision will be proven correct. 2120-Silman. English Opening. Our game only started after I played the first eight moves for both sides: 1.c4 Nf6 2.Nf3 e6 3.Nc3 Bb4 4.Qc2 O-O 5.g3 b6
6.Bg2 Bh7 7.a3 Bxc3 8.Qxc3 d6.
2120: "Lots of moves: O-O, b4, d3. What's my plan? Black's plan is to play . . .c5 and . . . dS and break open the center. How am I going to activate the dark-squared Bishop? I could play Bg5 with a pin or place it on the long diagonal.
9.d3 controls e4 and keeps options open."
While it's all right to play an obviously useful move (like 9.d3), · there is also a bit of laziness in the equation. White should really have at least a partial plan mapped out for himself. For example: White has the two Bishops and would like to make them better than the Knights. Since the dark-squared Bishop is the one piece that Black does not have, White should try his best to make it as active as possible. Thus d3 (limiting the enemy Knights), followed by b2-b4 and Bb2, placing the Bishop on the fine long diagonal, would be a simple but effective strategy.
9.d3 Nbd7
2120: "Where is his Knight heading to? If I develop my Bishop on the long diagonal, he could play . . . e5 and block it. 10.Bg5 is also silly due to . . . h6." He is still not quite sure what to do, so he holds off on any clear decisions and simply castles. This is fine here, but in many situations such trepidation might lead to problems.
10.O-O c5
2120: "Takes away this square from the Knight. Now he can't play . . .e5 since d5 would be weak. I could play b3 or b4. On l l.b4 cxb4 he opens up the a-file for me. I could also play d4 and open up the d-file so as to get play on d6. He wants to play for d5. My Knight on f3 is not doing anything so where do my pieces go? I'll get play by b2-b4."
M A N Y I M B AL A N C E S . O N E B O A R D I 2 2 3
In closed or semi-closed positions, you should lead with your pawns. For this reason, Black had no intention of playing . . .Nc5 since it would just get chased back by b2-b4. Instead, Black gains space with . . . c7-c5 and keeps his pieces flexibly posted behind his pawns. A d3-d4 advance would give Black use of the e4- square and activate his Knights. It should also be mentioned that Black won't hesitate to play an . . . e6-e5 advance if White posts his Bishop on the b2-h8 diagonal. True, it leaves a hole on dS. But can White actually use that hole? No, he can't. So, since this weakness is more illusion than reality, Black will be happy with . . . e6-e5 since it blocks the al-h8 diagonal and gains central territory.
11.b4 Qe7
2120: "Playing for dS. How can I mix things up? A good slow plan is b5 and a4-a5." Black has no intention of playing . . .d6-d5 (unless it achieves some very positive goal) since that would open up the position for the enemy Bishops. Instead, he will place his Rooks on squares that will inhibit White from playing in the middle. Once that is done, Black will seek counterchances on the kingside.
12.Bb2 Raes
2120: "Threatens to take on b4 and then follow up with . . . d6-d5 so I will prevent this and grab queenside space with b5."

2120: " A wealth o f riches. What d o I want to play? I'm ignoring the center, which is bad. However, 14.d4 gives him the e4-square.What does he do here? Play for . . . d6-d5? My g2-Bishop is doing relatively nothing. How do I get my pieces into play? I'd like to play for a4-a5 but that has nothing to do with my b2-Bishop. " It's strange to see a guy with such a "wealth of riches" be so confused about how he's going to get play! His 13.b5 took the tension out of the center so he might as well continue on the queenside with a3-a4-a5. Funnily enough, it's Black who has most of the options here. He can play . . . e6-e5 or he can play . . . d6-d5 with the idea of . . .d5-d4.
14.Nd2
2120: "To transfer it to b3 in anticipation of a4-a5." Leaving White with only one Bishop instead of two. Black is also happy to make this exchange since it leaves White's King a bit less secure. 14 ... Bxg2
15.Kxg2 e5
2120: "He has no threat. I could play e4 when my Bishop cold get into play via cl since d5 still scares me. Pushing to e4 leaves me with play on the queenside." So White has stopped . . . d6-dS once and for all. However, his dark-squared Bishop is now all but useless (the locked position will be friendlier to the Knights) and the whole game will now come down to a race between White's queenside play (he will open lines with a3-a4-a5) and Black's kingside play (he will play for . . . f7-fS). This game has seen a few imbalances parade by: First we had a Bishop vs. Knight battle (which still exists) and now the emphasis is on mutual wing attacks (made possible by the closed center).

2120: "Now I have two squares. NdS wins b6. I'd like to get my Queen into the defense. 24.NfS attacks d6 and closes the file. I am winning a pawn." Yes, White will win a pawn, but his King is far from safe.

White lost this battle because he didn't work hard enough to make his Bishop active and then, once he closed the center (and as a result lost the minor piece duel), he did not take proper precautions on the kingside. Ti ps * Always try and make your pawn structure conform to whatever minor piece you happen to own. * Creating a hole (a weak square) is only a problem if your opponent can make use of it. * When you own two Bishops, you usually want to retain both of them. * When the center is dead (closed), you must find play on one of the wings. Even if your opponent breaks through on his side of the board first, your plan must still move ahead. * It's not too hard to deduce that if you're playing on one wing, your opponent must have some play on the other. Never discount this! Get your attack going as fast as possible, but don't allow yourself to lose sight of the enemy's correct plan. How TO PLAY
THE OPENING
"Wiienwe first learn how to play chess, we are force-fed certain rules. Basic endgames, middlegame ideas, basic tactics, and how to play the opening correctly. In the opening, we're told to develop all our pieces ("Don't move the same piece twice!" gets repeated over and over like a never-ending mantra). Then we're told to castle quickly so that our King finds a safe haven and our Rooks can connect, like long lost lovers, and work together. Fighting for control of the center with our pieces and pawns comes next. At this point, we get a little cocky, thinking that we know everything there is to know (discounting the memorization of variations) about this phase of the game. All this advice is useful when we are starting out; however, as we progress up the rating ladder we lose more and more games in the opening (or due to the opening) and we begin to suspect that
2 3 0 / T H E A M A T E U R ' S M I N D
there i s something that we are not quite understanding. Sadly, we invariably discover that we can't find this mysterious missing knowledge in any books. We memorize more and more lines in an attempt to shore up our opening I.Q. , still lose countless games and, in a fit of despair, run off to Tibet to seek the mystical light that will eventually lead us to the discovery of the inner game of chess (at least, this is how I started out. I can only guess that it's the same for everyone). What is the real purpose of the opening? Is it really correct to mindlessly develop our pieces, only to discover that we often stand badly when everything is out? The answer is repeated again and again in the earlier parts of this book: we are trying to create favorable imbalances (or imbalances that have the potential to eventually become favorable) and develop our pieces and pawns around the differences that we have created at the beginning stages of the game. Once an imbalance is created, every developing move we make, every pawn that we push, must address this imbalance in some way. For example, after 1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 e6 3.Nc3 Bb4 (the Nimzo Indian Defense) 4.a3 Bxc3+ 5.bxc3, White accepts doubled pawns for the two Bishops and a space advantage in the center. White will play to increase this edge in territory via f2-f3 and e2- e4, while Black will strive to show that White's weakness on c4 is of greater consequence (via . . .b6, . . .Ba6 and . . . Nb8-c6-a5). Once again: it's this battle of ideas that determines where we develop our pieces, where we place each and every pawn, and delineates the fight that will be waged throughout the middlegame. Another common opening battle that is created in the first few moves comes about from the popular French Defense:
1.e4 e6
2.d4 d5
3.Nd2
So that White can meet the . . .Bb4 pin with c2-c3. 3 . . .Nf6
4.e5 Nfd7
White has an obvious space advantage in the center while Black will attempt to place pressure on the d4- and e5-pawns.
H O W TO P LAY T H E O PE N I N G I 2 3 1
5.f4
Greedily claiming even more space. This makes a lot of sense. White gained a certain advantage and he wants to place his pawns on squares that enable him to increase it. 5 ...c5 Black claims some space of his own on the queenside and simultaneously attacks the White pawn on d4. Mindless develop ing moves like 5 . . . Nc6 would leave Black without territory or threats after 6.c3.
6.c3
Following an important rule: Try to rriake your center as strong as possible so that the opponent will eventually be engulfed in its space-gaining coils. 6 ... Nc6 And Black devotes a lot of energy to attacking d4. This forces White to make concessions and defend his pawn.
7.Ndf31
Why would White move an already developed piece a second time? Wouldn't 7.Ngf3, bringing a new piece out, be more logical? No, after 7.Ngf3?! Qb6 (stepping up the pressure on d4) White would have trouble guarding d4; he would be forced to place his Knight (it would have to move again after all!) on the unpleasant b3-square. The correct 7.Ndf3 allows White to support his center with all his pieces. 7 ... Qb6
8.Ne2 and d4 is well-defended.
These two examples have shown us that both sides use the opening to create some difference and then try hard to demon strate that their difference is more important than the enemy's. This means that the opening is not really about development at all, it's about ideas and their implementation. • • • • •

Our first game shows both sides sparring to gain anything that might be of use later in the game. Targets, space, good and bad minor pieces; all these things come into consideration when we start out a serious game of chess. 2100-Silman. Reti Opening.
1.Nf3 d5
2.b4 Nf6
3.Bb2 e6
4.a3 Be7
I made him play these first few moves, curious to see how he would handle this unorthodox type of position. White has gained some queenside space and has a powerful Bishop on b2 that eyes the central dark-squares. Black has a solid position and some central space but, at the moment, he doesn't have any clear plan or targets to aim at. 2100: "I can fianchetto my other Bishop if I want to. I have space on the queenside. I could play fore2-e4 via d3. I must make use of my dark-squared Bishop. Since I like the e2-e4 push, I should fianchetto, castle and play to advance with that move." The kingside fianchetto does not make much sense to me since the hl-a8 diagonal will be firmly blocked by the pawn on d5. I would prefer e3 (gaining more control over d4) followed by Be2, O-O and c2-c4. This increases White's advantage on the queenside by adding to the territory that he already possesses.
5.g3 O-O
6.Bg2
2 100: "I don't understand the point of b4 since he can play . . . aS or . . . cs. If 6 . . .aS, then both 7.bS and bxaS are possible." Moves like . . . a7-a5 and . . . c7-c5 could be answered by b4-b5 (gaining more space) if White's light-squared Bishop stood on e2 (where it would defend b5). The light-squared Bishop does not participate in queenside operations on g2. How TO P LAY T H E O P E N I N G I 2 3 3 Remember: White gained queenside space on move two, so he should continue to add to the gains that he has already made. All his pieces should work together in this (or any other) effort.
6...
c5 2100: "There's no life to this game. If 7.b5, the pawn might be weak since nothing is defending it. I could take. Any pawn sacrifice fails and 7.c3 is extremely ugly. My plan is to utilize the dark-squared Bishop and play on the kingside. Since he is playing on the queenside, I could try to hold with bS but I don't like it due to . . . a6 when the a-file might open and a3 could become weak." He said that there's no life to the game, yet the position is full of interest. Subtle decisions must be made, plans found, imbal ances created. Who could want more? As for his comment about getting a kingside attack, this is pure bluster. There's much too much play in the center for thoughts of a kingside attack to enter anyone's head.
7.bxc5 Bxc5
2100: "I could either castle or play d3. Oh, oh! I just noticed that 8.d3 loses to 8 . . . Qb6 with a double-attack on f2 and b2. I have to castle." I mentioned earlier that Black wanted a clear plan and targets. His last two moves have left him with play against White's isolated a3-pawn and possibilities of creating pressure down the half-open c-file (the c2-pawn might become weak). This isn't much, but it's a beginning. White's plans also need to be clarified. After castling, White must, at some point, play c2-c4. This advance strives to open up the g2-a8 diagonal and to make the c-pawn an active participant in the coming battle (before it gets stuck on c2 and turns into a permanent target).
8.O-O Nc6
2100: "I have to come up with a plan. My b2-Bishop is undefended and bothers me in many lines. Change of plan! He has too much control of open center squares for me to do a kingside attack. I'll just play for e4 as originally intended."
2 3 4 I T H E AMA T E U R ' S M I N D
With 8 . . . Nc6, Black developed and tried to regain some control of his central dark-squares on e5 and d4. White's whole plan of e2-e4 is incorrect since that would leave him with a weak c-pawn on a half-open file. Better, as mentioned in my note to Black's seventh move, is a plan involving c2-c4.
9.d3 Qe7
2100: "I will continue to develop my pieces and play for e2- e4."
10.Nbd2 Rd8
2 100: "Does he really want to play . . . d5-d4 himself? I'm probably choosing incorrect plans. I can't tell if I want an open or dosed position. I want to play e4 but that doesn't work at the moment due to 11 . . . dxe4 with a nasty pin on the d-file. So I'll play e3 and if 1 1 . . .d4, then 12.e4." Usually a player with two fianchettoes wants the position to be as open as possible since that will benefit his heat-seeking Bishops. A closed position blocks them and makes them both useless. As stated earlier, White should play l l . c4 when 1 1 . . .d4 1 2.Nb3 opens the hl-a8 diagonal and gives White play on the queenside because of the extra space there and the open b-file. If Black answered 11 .c4 with 1 1 . . .dxc4?, then 1 2.Nxc4 would lead to a beautiful position for White. Both his Bishops enjoy wide-open diagonals, his Knights both aim at e5, all his pawns are safe, and he can generate play down the open b-file and c-file. ll.e3? Now a c2-c4 advance would leave the pawn on d3 weak. ll . ..b6 2100: "Playing to fianchetto on b7."

His c6-Knight gives him good control of the dark-squares so I will trade it off. " Notice how Black has placed his pieces on squares that fight for central control and restrain any central pawn advances by White. At the same time, Black has opened a key file (the c-file) and left White with weaknesses on c2 and a3. White, on the other hand, hasn't done much of anything. He has allowed weaknesses to appear in his position and, aside from randomly developing his pieces, has not made any effort to create points of attack in the enemy camp or to gain space for himself.

The same can be said for an early minor piece advantage (make all your pieces and pawns help to improve your piece and restrict his), a structural edge (show that his pawns are weaker than yours), or virtually any other imbalance. * Don't just develop pieces.

Black's fianchettoed Bishop is annoying. I want to play f4 but the position doesn't call for the move. The hell with it!" Why doesn't the position call for f2-f4? The move gains more kingside space and prepares for f4-f5 with a dangerous kingside attack. The Black Knight on e8 is heading for c7, but it may continue on to e6 and d4 if given the chance. White's opening with pawns on c4 and e4 gives the first player plenty of space but it also leaves a hole on d4 which Black would like to make use of.

I don't like the idea of him bringing his c-pawn to the vulnerable b5-square but I do like the fact that he's trying to open the position and take advantage of his lead in development.

Black has caught up in develop ment and is now trying to take over the initiative. This won't be so simple, though. True, Black does have the long-range advantage of superior pawn structure, but White has potential pressure down the e-file (against the e7-pawn) and his pieces are more active than the Black guys.

I will just develop and see what happens." While I was happy that he thought about mating patterns of that type, I was quick to point out that you can't live in fear of every shadow that comes your way. Getting the Black Queen to f3 and the Bishop to h3 would only be possible if White lost or advanced his g-pawn and made other blunders as well. The usefulness of seeing such patterns in advance is that, once you are aware of them, you can make a point of not allowing them to happen. A more advanced player would know that Black has gotten the two Bishops in exchange for a slightly compromised pawn structure. White's best plan is to play for d2-d4, exchanging the d pawn for Black's e-pawn. Then White would own a healthy 4 vs. 3 majority of pawns on the kingside. I didn't go into this stuff too heavily with 900 since I just wanted to concentrate on some easier concepts first. For example, one of the biggest problems a beginner has is making use of his Rooks. He just doesn't know how to get these pieces into play. If he had tried d2-d4 with the idea of opening the d-file for his Rooks, I would have been delighted. Instead, I constantly see players of this class play d2-d3 and suffer through chronic Rook clog for the rest of the game.

8.Na4
White finds another typical error. One-move attacks are useless if they don't torment the attacked piece or if they don't accomplish other goals. Here White is sticking his Knight on the rim and, after Black moves his Bishop to safety, the first player will have to deal with the stupid placement of the poor horse on a4. Much better was his first thought of 8.Be3 Bxe3 9.fxe3 which --- brings a pawn to the center (where it controls the useful d4- and f4-squares) and opens the f-file for his Rooks. The exchange of Bishops also gets rid of Black's Bishop-pair (when your opponent has two Bishops, trade one of them off!). Compare this with 8.Na4 Ba7 which does nothing at all to improve White's position. 8 ... Ba7 900: "I would like to play d2-d4 but I can't. I will play 9.Qe2, which connects my Rooks and prepares Be3." A really good idea. White would love to trade off Bishops with Be3 since that develops, gives White more control of d4 and gets rid of Black's Bishop pair (as discussed above).

Tips * Don't play mindless one-move attacks which, after the opponent moves his attacked unit to safety (and you must believe that he will see your threat), leave your attacking piece on a useless square. * If you advance your pawns in the center, you will be able to open central files for your Rooks. Be attentive to the needs of your Rooks and they will serve you well. * If the opponent has two Bishops, trade one of them off. It's much easier to deal with one Bishop than two, since a pair of them is able to control both white and black squares.
USING THE
ROOKS
Most chess players are aware that Rooks need open files to be effective. However, these files don't just appear out of thin air (well, sometimes they appear to, but don't count on this type of lucky manifestation), you must go out of your way to create them. The amateur player often has trouble using his Rooks; they just seem to sit there, trapped behind their own pawns, and often don't play a part in the game at all. The following thoughts should prove worthwhile to those who have trouble with Rooks: RULE 1 - Use your pawns to blast open files. This holds true in open and closed positions.

2.Nd31
White plays for c4-c5, gaining queenside space and preparing to blast open the c-file for his Rooks. This type of systematic preparation for the opening of a file is a necessary skill if you want to progress in chess. RULE 2 - Don't open a file if you think that the opponent will take it away from you. RULE 3 - If the creation of an open file has noth ing to do with your other positive imbalances, then don't waste your time creating it. In diagram 93, Black's pawns pointed to the kingside so he not only played to open files, he also played to gain extra territory in that area. White's dreams of c4-c5 also attempt to open files on the side of the board where he enjoys more space. RULE 4 - At times you can allow the opponent to dominate an open file, as long as you make sure that no penetration points exist along it. (94) Black to play. Black appears to have pressure along the open b-file in diagram 94, but this is really an illusion because these Rooks can't

penetrate into the enemy position. The squares b5, b4, b3, b2, and bl are all covered and are taboo to the Black Rooks. • • • • • The following position shows that a file without penetration points is more or less useless. (95) Karpov-Andersson, Stockholm 1969. Black to play. The center is closed and Black's superiority on the queenside is just as obvious as White's on the kingside.

A beautiful game in which Karpov nullified the enemy files and used his own to create a decisive penetration into the hostile position. U S I N G Tll E R O O K S I 2 5 1 I thought that this idea o f taking away penetra�ion points along a file might be unfamiliar to most amateurs. To test out this theory, I tried the same position on several of my students. Sure enough, none of them knew how to keep Rooks from penetrating along an open file . Here is the most instructive of these contests. (96) 1400-Silman. Black to play. 1400: "Black's dark-squared Bishop stinks. White has more space in the center and a great Knight on g6. Black has more territory on the queenside and would like to open the b-file. Though it's Black to move, I still\like White. Black would like to trade pieces, particularly the g6-Knight."

1400: "Heading for b4. Since the center is closed, I will start to get things going on the kingside. "
4.Nxg5
Before this, White played just like Karpov! However, now he shows that he feels it is a race on opposite wings (which means that you must proceed with speed). While this demonstrates a
2 5 2 I T H E AMAT E U R ' S M I N D
good understanding of wing situations, it's simply not true here. White could, and should, keep the enemy pieces out (via Bd2-c3 which, by the way, also eyes the Black a-pawn) and then take all the time he wants on the opposite side. 4 . . . fxg5 1400: "I'm trying to figure out the best way to get in. Since the center is locked, I would like to use my kingside pawns. An immediate f2-f4 fails but I do want to push f2-f4 at some point. The only way to do it is a Rook move followed by g3 and f4. Seems like it's too slow, though. Well, I have to get my Rook out of the way but I don't know where to put it." Notice how he played 4.Nxg5 without detailed thought. He didn't bother looking at the ramifications of his decision. This move was an act of aggression on the kingside that made him feel bener but did nothing to open lines on that side of the board. On the contrary, it made it harder for White to play the file-opening f2-f4.
5.Rc3 Be7
1400: "He wants to play . . . g5-g4 followed by . . .BgS, trading off his bad Bishop. I will stop this with g2-g4, when his dark-squared Bishop remains very bad."
6.g4?
He thought that he saw a threat and became so distracted by it that he forgot all about opening lines on the kingside. Instead, he stopped the "threat" of . . .g5-g4 (which in actuality places the pawn in grave danger after Bd3-e2) and closed up the very side he was hoping to open. Don't become so entranced by the enemy's ideas that you forget all about your own. 6 . . .Bf6 1400: "That makes it hard to push f2-f4. I still want to play for f4 and if he takes . . .exf4 then e4-e5 is possible. So 7.Qe2 is an idea." Black is making sure that any tactically based e4-e5 advance fails. Once he does that, he will have a free hand on the queenside. In a way, this is the reverse of what happened in the Karpov-Andersson game.

I wanted to see how he would react to the loss of material. I was hoping he'd notice that, after Black takes on g6 (via 10 . . .Qxg6), White can make use of tactics (created by the c2-Bishop's potential X-ray to the Black Queen on g6) by 1 1 .f4 gxf4 (1 1 . . .exf4 1 2.eS) 12.Bxf4. Of course, this still fails due to 12 . . . exf4 13.eS Qe8, taking advantage of the unprotected White Queen (14 .Qd3 QxeS is nothing for White), but such tactics can often tum a game around and must be noticed if you want to have any real chance of saving a poor position.
10.Qh2?
1400: "Eyeing h6 and if he takes on g6 I go to h5 and trade." What is this madness about trading? Why would he want to go into an endgame after he has lost a pawn? The threar to the g6- pawn seems to have blown one of his fuses! 10 ...Qxg6

Tips * Trading bad Bishops is fine, but don't think about that to the exclusion of everything else. * Open files are only valuable if you can effect some sort of penetration on them. * If you can stop the opponent's play, you don't have to be in a hurry with your own.
U S I N G H I E R O O K S I 2 5 5
I n the diagram that follows, w e see a position that i s far from enticing for Black. Aside from having the inferior pawn structure, he is also about to lose a pawn. Masters know that in Rook endgames it is of the utmost imp01tance to keep one's Rook active. This rule should be followed even if you have to sacrifice a pawn. However, I suspected that in the amateur ranks this well known principle was unknown. (97) Silman-1 480 Black to play. How would an amateur defend such a position? I tried it against several students to serrif their reactions were uniform or varied from individual to individual. 1 480: "The position is miserable for Black. I need to give up a pawn and penetrate with my Rook so it gets active. However, 1 . . .Ke7 2.Rxa6 leaves him with two connected passed pawns on the queenside. My Rook could penetrate then and his Rook would be in front of his pawns but that probably doesn't make any difference. The other problem is that if I let him chop on d6, then the f6-pa wn would also hang. I would consider the game lost here and I would not have a positive attitude. I would play 1 . . .Ke7 2.R:xa6 Rc7 and penetrate with my Rook. Maybe I could get some play." 1 ... Ke7? Poor 1480 didn't enjoy this position at all! Apparently he was not aware of the old saying, "All Rook endings are drawn."
2 5 6 I T H E AMAT E U R .S M I N D
This i s actually a n old joke saying, but there is more truth to it than one would imagine. Why? Because all Rook endings take patience and skill to win. Such qualities are not always present, and a dogged resistance can easily bring rewards. He gave up the a-pawn because he had already given up the game. When you adopt a loser's attitude you will play loser moves. You must believe that you have a chance. If you don't, then your moves will echo this sentiment. His 1 . . .Ke7 gave White two connected passed pawns after 2.Rxa6, and these two pawns will easily win the game for the first player. We stopped the game since 1480 was too disgusted with the position to continue! Silman-1500 (also from diagram 97) 1500: "I can't save both pawns so I have two choices. One is to save the d6-pawn and advance the f-pawn and create a passed d-pawn. Second, is to try to keep the a-pawn by advancing it and give up the d6-pawn. I can get my Rook behind his pawns and try to prevent him from queening. The first plan gives him two passers on the queenside so the second is the way to go. "I have 1 . . .a5 or l . . . Ra7. The former allows 2.Ra6. I'm not crazy about 1 . . . Ra7 because it dooms my Rook to passivity, so 1 . . .a5 is better." I was very happy about what he had to say. He wanted to avoid a passive Rook and did not want to give White two connected passed pawns. 1 . . . a5 1500: "If 2.Ra6 Rb5."
2.Rxd6 Ke7
1500: "Protects the f-pawn, centralizes my King and attacks the Rook." So far he's done quite well. This natural move, though, just forces the White Rook to a better square. For the superior 2 . . . a4, see the next game.

However, my Rook is not active and . . . Ra7 does nothing to help. I have to activate my Rook and stop his queenside pawns. I must hold the a-pawn and . . .a5 followed by . . .Ra7 is the only way to do it. I don't care about my d-pawn but my a-pawn is everything. Unfor¢'nately, my King can't be activated either.

I was especially pleased that he noted the drawn four vs. three endgame whenever you have pawns on only one side of the board you create excellent drawing chances. 1 . . . a5

CURSE
OF THE
KING HUNTER
THE CURS E
MINDLESS
Everyone likes to attack the opponent's King. If it works, you get a quick win with a lot of flash. However, it drlves me to distraction when a player tries to do this without any regard for the particulars of the position. The amateur must learn that you have to do what the position calls for, not what you want to do! This means that you may be the finest attacker of all time, however, if the position calls for a queenside attack against a weak pawn, then that is what you should do. Attacks against the enemy King only make sense in the following situations: > If the center is locked, you should play in the direction that your pawns point. You play where your pawns point because that is where your territory lies.

White to play. White has come out of the opening with a nice game: he has more space on the queenside and has possibilities to expand in the center with e3-e4, thereby stopping i\,!ack from doing the same thing with a later . . .e6-e5. In the actual game, White was blind to the fact that his fortunes were tied to his extra queenside space and central possibilities. Instead, he decided that a kingside attack was in order. Why? My guess is that he likes to go after Kings and thought that this was as good a time to do it as any. Needless to say, this is not the way to play good chess!
13.Ne2?
White thinks that a Knight on g3 will help him create a kingside attack simply because he has an extra piece on that side of the board. However, you should lead your pieces to squares where they have a future. Once the poor horse reaches g3 it will be badly posted since it can't go to e4, f5 or M!

He played a good move, but his reasoning was confused-to say the least! Never start by looking at the candidate moves-that's the last thing you should do! My student, though, immediately began to list them (I had not seen him for two years, so it seems that he had forgotten what we had discussed in our old sessions). Next he jumped from one thing to another, never noticing that he possessed extra queenside space. Finally, he makes the cryptic statement that he is going to kick Black's Knights (how?) and then he plays 13.Qc2. At the risk of repeating myself, you start by listing all the imbalances. Then you ask which side of the board you (and your opponent!) are going to play on (you will only play where you have a favorable imbalance). You only look at candidate moves when you have assessed these other factors. 13 ... Nh5
14.Bxe7 Qxe7
1600: "I want to mate Black on the kingside. How do I get there? His hS-Knight is awkward so I don't want to chase it back into play. I have a Knight on c3 that's df>ing nothing so I should re-position it and make it more acti�e. My pawn on e3 keeps his Knight on h5 out. I want to break in the center, though, and occupy d6. To do this I must get counterplay in the center. By playing e3-e4, I get play in the middle but give his Knight access to f4." My heart sank when he said that he wanted to mate on the kingside! What justification does he have for this, other than desire? Are there targets there? Is my King denuded? Is his whole army posted in that sector? Interestingly, he then forgot about this idea and found more logical ideas. His comment about my Knight being offside and his not wanting to drive it back into play is excellent-attacking a piece is useless unless you improve your position by doing so or force his piece to an inferior square. I also loved his newfound idea to break in the center by e3-e4 and, hope of hopes, make use of the d6-square. Unfortunately, this is where his good intentions ran into that oh-so-common fear of ghosts-he didn't want to allow Black to answer e4 with . . . . Nf4. By concentrating on this unimportant Black possibility (who cares if Black takes two
2 6 8 I T H E A M A T E U R ' S M I N D
moves to trade Knight for Bishop; wouldn't White b e able to make significant gains by then?), he got lured into the same error that we saw in the original example!
15.Ne2?
16o0: "This keeps him out of f4. My long-range plan is to play a Knight to d6." Horrible. One idea of playing e3-e4 is that he can answer . . .dx.e4 with Nxe4 when the dream of using d6 becomes a reality. With the Knight on e2, however, this is no longer possible. Another idea associated with e3-e4 is that he can follow up with a Rook to the e-file when White would have considerable pressure in the center. The immediate 15.e4 was called for, when Black could not counterattack with . . . .e6-e5 since d5 would fall. The Knight's absence from the center gives Black the time to free himself. 15 . . . e5 1 600: "I will counterattack."
16.e4
With Black suddenly showing signs of activity, White feels compelled to strike back. However, instead of being the one to dictate the tempo of the game, now White is reacting to Black. 16 ...Nhf6 The Knight rushes back to the center where it defends d5 and attacks e4. 1600:" I must watch out for 17.exd5 e4 with a fork. How do I exchange without allowing this fork?" Decentralizing and time-wasting moves like 1 5.Ne2 usually lead to the opponent taking the initiative.

White's three to three count is a bit off (Black is attacking e4 four times), though another oversight is the straw that will break his back.
20.Nxd4??
You should always be aware of all your weak points and undefended pieces.

Tips * Moving a piece away from the center (called a decentralizing move) should always be viewed with suspicion. * Only go after the enemy King if the position justifies it. A King-hunt is not something you decide to do because you "feel like it." * Undefended pieces often lead to nasty tactical surprises. Make sure your pieces are well-gu arded.
2 7 0 / T H E A M A T E U R ' S M I N D
One of the amateur's greatest weaknesses is his inability to grab the initiative. He wants to attack but he does not realize that the concept of attack must encompass the whole board. Real attacking means putting pressure against a particular target; this can be an enemy King or a weak pawn. You should strive to create a target and then force your opponent to react to your threats against it. In our next game, White astutely notices the creation of a weakness and jumps all over it. ( 1 05) 1400-Silman. White to play. 1400: "Central space is even. There is some action on the queenside and I have more space there due to my pawn on cS. The squares and pawns on c6, d6 and b6 are weak but not easy for White to get to. White is safe on the kingside. White's pawns are pointing to the queenside. I would like to put my Bishop on the h2-b8 diagonal where it hits e5 and d6-it's not doing much where it stands. "Now for a plan. I want to play either in the center or on the queenside. I like Bg3, which aims at both sectors, followed by NeS." I'm extremely happy with his appraisal. He didn't even look at the kingside since there were no favorable imbalances in that area. The only thing he didn't notice was Black's ultimate inten tion of advancing his pawn to e5. Don't forget to look for your opponent's best plans! By doing that, you won't run into any unpleasant surprises.

Bingo! All of a sudden my position takes a turn for the worse. He wants to blow me off the board and it's not clear if I can do anything about it.

Note, however, that White has only decided to go for a kingside attack after Black weakened the light-squares around his King. In other words, this decision was not made lightly-he had a clear reason to attack my King. 20 .. . RfS 1400: "I'm looking at how much damage Qg6 does. He can play . . .fS and shut off my Bishop.

With an extra pawn and an attack, he begins to get greedy for small gains. Instead of this move, which restricts the mobility of his pieces, he should do two things (if no immediate crush exists): 1) take away all possible counterplay-he is a pawn up and winning, so if he takes all my cheapo chances away he should easily score the point. 2) Reorganize and then break through with the remainder of his forces. Aside from 24.BxfS! exfS 25.e6 which wins at once, White could play quietly and lock in the victory with 24.Rbl (defending the b-pawn and stopping any nonsense down the a-file) followed by Qg6 and Rh3. The beauty of this line (if something like 24.BxfS did not exist) is that Black would be completely helpless and would likely resign.

T H E C U R S E OF T H E M I N D LE S S K I N G H U N T E R I 275
Our final example in this chapter starts with a quiet positional opening. White is supposed to play on the queenside and in the center but somehow his amateur eyes still stare longingly at the Black King. The first moves were: 1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 e6 3.Nc3 Bb4 4.e3 O-O
5.Bd3 d5 6.Nf3 b6 7.O-O Bb7 8.a3 Bd6 9.cxd5 exd5 10.b4 a6
and now 1 500 had to annotate the book moves for both sides: (106) White to play. 1500: "White wants to push his pawn on f2 to f4. To do this he must move his Knight to el." I asked where White should be trying to play. 1500: "Black's Bishops are aimed at White's kingside. So Black is attacking the King. I still like Nel followed by f4, though, with a kingside attack for White." Amazing! Look how the amateur player always wants to go after the King, no matter what the position calls for! He tells me that Black is attacking the King but he ignores this and says that he wants to do the same via Ne 1 and f4 (which weakens e4 and e3 along an open file). Why so stubborn? Black's semi-open e-file is closer to the kingside than White's semi-open c-file. Where is White's space advantage? On the queenside, or course. Since you are supposed to play where your advantages are, this means that White should be setting his sights on the queenside.

1 500: "Not the kind o f move I would play. This pressures d5 but I don't like it since d5 is well defended. What's the point if something is already guarded?" 1 1 .Qb3 has several points. By attacking dS, White ties down two Black pieces (Knight on f6 and Bishop on b7) to its defense. The real purpose, though, is based on the semi-open c-file. White wants to place his Rooks on that file and bring pressure to bear on the Black c7-pawn. However, White sees that the Black Bishop on d6 not only eyes his kingside, but also defends c7. White's plan is to trade off this fine Black piece for the bad Bishop on cl via a3-a4, Ba3 and b4-bS. This would exchange a poor piece for a good one, hurt Black's chances for a successful kingside attack and leave the c-pawn more vulnerable to an assault by the White Rooks. 11 . . . Qe7 1500: "This pressures the center and centralizes a piece." It does those things but it also eyes b4 and makes a2-a4 and Ba3 more difficult to achieve.
12.Rbl
1500: "Protects b4 so he can push a4 and a5. " He does not see the real point of White's play but I did not expect him to. White is using an advanced idea that would probably be overlooked by most players under 2100. The main point of this exercise was to see if 1 500 could concentrate on a queenside attack. Unfortunately, his wistful glances towards my King made it clear where his heart was. The game was stopped at this point. Ti p s * You must be able to play in all three areas of the board (queenside, center, and kingside), depending on where your favorable imbalances are. * A person that does nothing but attacks the enemy King will end up a loser most of the time. Balance, and a willingness to do whatever is called for, is the key to success in chess.
WHICH SIDE
OF THE BOARD
SHOULD You
PLAY ON?
The center of the chess board is the area you wDu!d like to control the most. Play there with as much energy as you can because the rewards are great for those that succeed in this quest. Why is the center important? Because your pieces can quickly reach any area of the board from the center. Pieces huddled on one wing are more or less committed to play in that �rea, leaving the other two parts of the board defenseless. Of course, if the center is blocked by pawns, both. armies are forced to seek employment elsewhere. This decision is not a matter of taste--closed centers call for wing action, and the proper wing to play on can be ascertained by using the "pawn pointing technique." So, how does this tie in with a correct approach to understand ing a position? That should be obvious! You can't find a good
278 I T H E AMA T E U R · s M I N D
move if you don't know Which Side of the board you are SU pposed play on. To do this, you first take note of all the imbalances for both sides. Once this is done, try to find a plan based on those imbalances-try to use those favorable aspects of your game as guidelines that will tell you where to seek extra space, where to attack weak enemy pawns and where to create effective homes for your pieces. For example, the center is locked up. Your opponent has a weak, isolated pawn on the queenside and you also have a space advantage in that area. Your opponent is the one with the advantage in space on the kingside and most of his pieces are massed in that area. Where should you play? You may dream of running over to the kingside and trying to clobber his King, but that is just an emotional reaction that has little to do with the reality of the board. You must conquer this illogical desire and quietly go after his weak pawn on the queenside. That's your side of the board, that's where you should play. • • • • • During my private lessons, I constantly harp on certain key themes: Always pay attention to Bishop versus Knight; never play without a plan; before playing a move, always ask yourself, "What wonderful thing does this move do for my position?" And, of course, I remind my students to follow one of the finest general rules in chess: The best reaction to an attack on the wing is a counterattack in the center. When a person first comes to me, they either don't know this rule or, if they have heard of it, they've never bothered to follow it. However, after a few sessions of me nagging them, they usually begin to develop an awareness of such possibilities. Of course, if "C'', "B" and "A" players are able to use this rule, then one would think that Grandmasters would never be victims of it. The following game, though, shows that this is simply not the case-players of all strengths leave themselves open to its effects. If you want to punish them, all you have to do is pull your arm back and punch them in the center!

1000-Silman. White to play. In the next few examples, I tested my students' ability to recognize when a central counterattack was called for by giving them the White side of the diagrammed position. If they showed a mastery of the necessary concepts, they would be rewarded in the usual way: a new car, a date with some super-model, a microscopic rendition of Elliott Winslow's signature, etc. How ever, if they failed to understand what was going on, they would have to pay ten times the normal lesson fee (the idea of fines during a lesson has been espoused by IM John Grefe). 1000: "Black has a weak square on e5 which White could use for his Knight. If I could trade off my Bishop for his Knight, I could use it but I don't know if that is possible. Black is starting a kingside attack which is justified since the center is locked; there are no open files. He will play . . . g4 and chase my Knight to a poor square. I can trade Queens with Qa3 but I'm not sure if that does any good. I can take on d5 when . . . cxd5 allows Qc7 with a pin on his Knight. If . . . exd5 my Bishop gets more scope. I will play cxd5 and try to get play in the middle." This guy's rating is only 1000 yet he pointed out some profound things! He noted the possibility of gaining a superior minor piece if his Knight could stay on e5. He also remembered me telling him that a wing attack is only justified if the center is under your control or is closed. He was well aware that he should try to open the center up and so he tried l.cxd5. I suppose the
2 8 2 / T H E AMAT E U R 'S M I N D
idea of Nd2 followed by f3 and e4 was too difficult since the Knight move to d2 looks like a retreat and it also goes away form the desired e5-post. Don't be afraid of retreating moves it they help achieve an important goal (in this case, blasting open the center with e3-e4).
13.cxd5 exd5
1000: "I would love to get his Knight or play e3-e4. Maybe that push would be possible after Rfel . " This earned a hefty fine. Words like "maybe" should not play a part in one's choice of move-you should know what your moves will lead to! For example, if he had tried 14.b2-b4 with the idea of opening the c-file with b4-b5, I would have been proud of him (it doesn't matter if it's the best plan or not, at least he is following a dear course of action and trying to do something positive by opening a file for his Queen and Rook) since that would have continued his reasoning behind 13.cxd5. Unfortu nately, when I refused to open the c-file for him (via 13 . . . cxd5) he simply gave up on the idea.
14.Rfel g4
1000: "At this point, I have to jump into eS." Now he's just reacting to my moves and is no longer trying to follow any kind of plan. Try to notice when the transition between thinking of your own ideas and reacting to the opponent takes place. In this game, 1000 got lazy on move two and never woke up.

The next stage is to panic and live in the past (I know because I've done it several hundred times in my career). Now he is thinking about all the things he could/should have done earlier in the game. Notice how even these dreams (h2-h3 to stop my . . . g4 push) are defensive in nature. We stopped the game and brought him back to reality with smelling salts. Our next game starts from the same position. 009) 1700-Silman. White to play. 1700: "All of Black's weaknesses are covered. His King is safe since his Queen and Rook defend. Black has a kingside attack. Material is even. White must defend the e4-square; Black would love to stuff a piece there. Black has more space. Where would both sides like to place their pieces? Well, e4 and eS are the squares. Black also has an unguarded Queen on e7. If White can push his pawn to e4, followed by Rel , then the Queen on e7 would be both ered. So what is White's best move? I think White is in trouble. Black has space and kingside pressure. Black threatens . . .g4 followed by . . . Rf8-f6-h6. What can White do to prevent mate on h2?" Very interesting! He noted that the e4- and e5-squares were important but he failed to note that e5 is a permanent weakness while anything on e4 can be chased away by f2-f3 or even taken by
2 8 4 / T H E AM A T E U R ' S M I N D
the Bishop. All the positive things that he said about Black's position would be true if the center stays closed. He mentioned the possibility of playing for e3-e4 (opening the center) but he gave up on it immediately. After the game, he told me that it would be too difficult to get e3-e4 in. Listen! If serious chess means you need thirty minutes to find an answer to the position, then that is time well-spent. If you can't solve the position, at least you will have the satisfaction of knowing that you tried as hard as you could. If you are White here and see that White's only hope is to play for e3-e4, don't just give up on the idea. That's like giving up on yourself! Insist on finding a way to make positive things happen.

He is now in a completely defensive mentality. Who cares if my Queen goes to h4? A Queen by herself can't do much damage. He should have played on the queenside by b2-b4 or even c4-c5 (gaining more space). It's important to note that with the g-pawn on g2, Black's . . . h7-h5-h4 advance has no sting since . . . h4-h3 can be met by g2-g3 while . . . g4-g3 is met by h2-h3.

Black's dark-squared Bishop is strong, though. The Bishop on gS is not doing anything other than pinning the Knight. One plan is to trade the g4- and e2-Bishops; my e2-Bishop is horrendous.

I don't know what he is talking about when he alludes to the weak squares in White's camp. However, his decision to play Rbl and b2-b4 is excellent.

Ti ps * Some imbalances, like the two Bishops, may not be too useful right away. However, they could easily become a force later in the game. * In closed or semi-closed positions, you usually play in the sector where you own the most space. White's queenside strategy was very effective in the last game, but most amateurs have a tendency to reject queenside or central play; their eyes are only aimed at the King.

However, he is so caught up in creating immediate threats that he didn't seriously entertain a slower pl.i.n based on a gradual buildup of queenside pressure by Qb3, Rc2 and Rael (eyeing c7). He could also pressure the d-pawn by Nel-d3-f4 and Bf3. What is most interesting is that he knew that the queenside is where he is supposed to play, but he is desperately looking for any excuse to initiate play on the kingside. Once he noticed the

This also gives me options of Qd3 followed by Bb3. " All of a sudden, h e decides that he has plenty of time (which he does) but he still goes ahead with his kingside hopes. One of the things he's done well during the last several moves is to always try to understand the point behind his opponent's move. This is a good habit that will save him in lots of games. If you know what the enemy is up to, you will not have to suffer through unpleasant surprises. This doesn't mean that he actually understood what Black was really doing, but he gave it his best shot. Another highlight of 1 5SO's thinking is his ability to ignore the opponent's threats. Once he sees what Black is up to, he refuses to react to it, always preferring to follow his own plans.

a-pawn and also threatens Ba4 with an attack on c6. Oops . . . if I play Qd3, my pawn hangs. Perhaps a2-a3 is in order to free my Queen." Since Black's pawns point to the kingside, Black turns his Bishop's attentions to that side of the board. Black has stopped White's plans, so 1 550 starts to panic. To his credit, he defends his pawn and tries to keep everything safe.

This whole kingside idea is bogus since Black can safely defend h7 with . . . g6 or with . . . Nf6 or . . . Nf8. The student should take note of the White pieces. Are they all working for a central b reak with e3-e4? No . Are they working together to pressure the q ueenside? Two of them are, the rest are just sitting around doing nothing. White went wrong by playing a bit on one side and a bit on the other. You must figure out where you want to play right away a nd make your whole army devote itself to that plan. We stopped the game. Tips * Pick a side of the board and stake a claim! Go after it with gusto and don't allow the opponent or your secret desires to distract you . * The kingside is not the end-all and be-all of chess. Seeking play in the center or on the queenside is just as effective (often more so) as a kingside attack.

A direct kingside attacking set-up in an open position can be very dangerous, and the defender should start a central and/or queenside counterattack right away. When facing a kingside attack in an open position, speed is of the essence and you must play with a lot of energy or fall victim to the enemy's attack.

DEVELOPING
MENTAL
TOUGHNESS
It's time to develop an attitude! Since chess is largely a game of psychology, you must believe in yourself if you are going to have any hope of achieving good results. As soon as doubts enter into the equation, the moves come more slowly, a tendency towards passivity raises its ugly head and you find yourself entertaining destructive thoughts concerning the horrible things (often imagi nary) your opponent is going to do to you. To illustrate how strong a part attitude plays, let's compare two of my students. Student number-one is ten years old and knows very little about the game. He has no positional under standing at all, plays the opening very poorly and thinks the endgame is an entirely different sport. With a style geared only for mating attacks one would think he would do poorly, but it turns out that he owns a 1900 rating and often beats players hundreds of points higher than himself! His success is made possible by an
.300 I T H E A M A T E U R s M I N D
overwhelming desire to win every game. When he plays a move, you know it has some mean intention behind it. Student number-two is fifty years old and possesses the positional understanding of an expert, a solid opening repertoire and a fair knowledge of the endgame. Superior in almost every respect to student number-one, he only has a rating of 1 500. The reason? He lacks confidence and is too quick to give up on his plans in the face of imaginary threats. The following suggestions should prove helpful to anyone who regularly makes mental errors during a chess game: 1) Always expect the opponent to see your threat and make the best reply. This forces you to look for moves that improve your position even if he is aware of your plans. 2) Play to win against anyone and everyone. Even if a draw suffices to give you a high placing in the final round of a tournament, playing to split the point is one of the best ways to lose a game. Play to win and make him begyou for the draw! 3) H you find a plan that conforms to the demands of the position, follow through with it. Don't allow the opponent to say "boo" and scare you from your proper path. 4) Play with confidence. Never allow yourself to believe that you are playing some sort of perfect chess machine (they don't exist). Allhuman oppo nents make errors and have lapses. This means that everyone can be beaten. Play without fear (after all , we are allgoing to lose lots of games, so there is nothing to be afraid of, is there?) and you will instillfear into your opponents. 5) H you tlnd yourself in a lost position, tighten everything up and hang on like grim death-don't play one last cheap shot and resign. Play the move that you would hate to see if you were in his situa tion. Extending the game in this manner will make
D EV E LO P I N G M E N T A L T O U G H N E S S I 3 0 1
him work hard for the point and, if he gets tired or frustrated, may even lead to a mistake on his part and a success for you. 6) H your opponent is in time pressure, never try to move quickly and push him over on the clock. Take your time and concentrate on making the best moves. Moving fast places you in the same situation that he is in and gives you an excellent chance to make a major error. • • • • • The most common mental error in chess is that of supplication: you begin to get worried about your opponent's plans, you stop implementing your own ideas and just react to his and, finally, you end up completely on the defensive. We have seen examples of this condition throughout this book. Here is another look at a disease that must be tamed before you can expect good results. Our diagrammed position came about after 1.c4 e5 2.Nc3 Nc6 3.g3 g6 4.Bg2 Bg7 5.d3 d6 6.Nf3 Nf6 7.O-O O-O.

be playing on that side of the board. What about Black? His pawns are aiming at my kingside-I don't like that at all! Black will probably play . . .Ne8 followed by . . . t7-f5 and try to mate me. I can't allow him to do that so I'll stop his plans with Bg5, pinning and immobilizing his Knight." White's correct plan is 8.Rbl followed by the space-gaining b4-b5. Unfortunately, after only seven moves White demonstrates a losing attitude by concentrating on Black's ideas to the exclusion of his own plans. It is very important to realize that White has already planted the seeds of his own defeat by refusing to take a more aggressive stance. This doesn't mean that you always have to attack. It means that every move you play should do something positive for your position. Keep this idea in mind: After deciding what move you want to play, write it down, look at all possible checks and captures and ask, "What wonderful thing does this move do for my position?" If your move doesn't stand up to this simple question, then don't play it! Actually, White's 8.Bg5 is not bad. By getting rid of the Knight on f6, White fights for control of d5. Unfortunately, this is not why White played it. He was thinking about nothing more than stopping the enemy from attacking him-pure defense and nothing else. The best way to get an opponent to stop his aggressive intentions is to worry him with your own plans.
8.Bg5 h6
1 378: "Taking his Knight would be bad because he would just recapture, move the piece away, and advance his pawn to f5. I need to retain this Bishop with a retreat." Still mesmerized by Black's kingside potential, White accepts a further loss of time. He still has not made one move towards his queenside attack. Best was 8.Bxf6 when the d5-square has been weakened and White is free to proceed with his own plans on the opposite wing. Don't just wish you had play somewhere. The great players insist on getting play-they make it happen!

1378: "He's attacking my Bishop and I can't move it to safety. I suppose I should get things started on the queenside with 1 1.Rcl, when a later . . .dS allows me to create a semi open file." More incorrect thinking. Rather than take matters into his own hands, White plays a move that may be good "someday." I'm sorry, but this is not good enough. There is no room in chess for words such as "maybe," "someday" and "somehow. " Either a move does something, or it doesn't. Don't rely on your opponent to make your moves useful.
11.Rcl? f5
1378: "I have to chase his Knight away." White has given up all hope of finding an active plan or even of thinking ahead. He is now simply reacting from move to move and has completed his slide into mental paralysis.

13.fxe3 h5
1378: "He threatens . . . h5-h4 so I have to stop him. " Poor White is so freaked out that he sees danger in every Black move. Why did Black play his 13th move? Chess is largely a game of targets (weak pawns are the most common type of target, but weakened squares and a vulnerable King may also fall into our category) and I often talk of "target consciousness" in my lessons.
3"04 I T H E A M A T E U R ' > M I N D
Two skillsmust be honed: 1) the ability to recognize and create targets; 2) the ability to attack them with as much energy as possible. Black's last move, . . .h6-h5, was designed to allow the g7-Bishop to start an attack against White's newly weakened e3-pawn.
14.h4
Attacking on different wings is a common part of chess and such a situation often creates a very violent struggle. The first player to give up on his own play and pay attention to the opponent's will most likely end up losing. In fact, it's your job to sell him on your plan. I liken this to grabbing the opponent's head and physically turning it in the direction you want him to face. Once you get him reacting to your threats (playing your game), he will no longer be thinking in terms of progressing with his own ideas. Then your victory will only be a matter of time. 14 . . . Bh6 1378: "Now he's attacking e3. I can only defend with the King and the Rook. If 15.Rf3, e4 16.dxe4 Ne5 is possible so the King move is forced." Though 1378 was being trained in my system of thinking (as explained in the third edition of How To Reassess Your Chess), he didn't make use of it at all in this game. As you can see from 1 378's experience, living from move-to-move without ever look ing at the imbalances or trying to assert mental mastery over the opponent will give you nothing but a miserable defensive chore and a likely loss. 1 5.Kf2? Strange, White got so worried about the weakness on e3 that he completely forgot about the danger to his own King. 15.Nd5 would have held out a little longer, but White's game was already an unhappy mess. 15 . . . f4 Destroying the King's protection. Why have White's worst fears come true? Picture a car race. You have two ways to avoid
D E V E LO P I N G M E N T A L TOU G H N E S S I 305
defeat. You can either beat your opponent to the finish line or you can stand in front of his car and try to stop it. In this game, White could not really stop Black from carrying out his plan of kingside pressure. His only hope was to go for the finish line and try to prove that his queenside play was more valuable than Black's play on the opposite wing. Failing to do this, White played into Black's plans, created weaknesses in his own camp and got run down by an opponent who was bigger and stronger on the kingside due to Black's space advantage in that area. This is where reading the imbalances comes into play: if you can't list the imbalances, you won't know which side of the board to play on. In other words, you'll be playing blind. At this point we decided to stop the game. How is it that 1378, an aggressive player who works hard at the board, played so passively? The answer is that when you get involved in a particular frame of mind, it's hard to extricate yourself from it (ever hear a song and have it play in your head for the rest of the day?); any person who starts thinking in a passive, fearful manner will find his/her attitude getting progressively worse. This disease can only be prevented by recognizing the problem and making a concerted effort to eradicate it. I recommend the following simple study technique for those players who are affected by this defensive/reactive malady: Go through your losses and make a note at the point where you think you gave control to your opponent (note the distinction be tween the opponent taking control and you giving it away). When you have done this, look at the imbalances and try to find what the correct moves and ideas should have been (of course, the moves and ideas must be based on those imbalances!). If you want to win, you must demand a constructive continuation from yourself, so don't give up until you find something that fits the above criteria. What we are trying to do is create an attitude where you will not accept anything but a complete effort from yourself. The creation of proper mental habits will lead to a more satisfying tournament experience. Another common mental error is the tendency to see threats where none exist. When you react to imaginary threats, you are
3 () 6 I T H E A M A T E U R ' S M I N D
often wasting time trying to prevent the opponent from making a bad move! Don't go out of your way to prevent something unless you are sure that it would really be a problem. In the following example, we see an amateur who is afraid of what Black does and also of what Black might do! (115) 1413-Silman. White to play. The position in the diagram was reached after 1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 d6 3.Nc3 Bf5 4.f3 Nbd7 5.e4 Bg6 6.Be3 c6 7 .Bd3 e5 8.Nge2 Be7. 1413: "White has a space edge over the whole board-even in development. I think it's time to get my King out of the center." 1413 noted that he owned a space advantage but he did not even try to come up with an active plan. Of course, it's quite possible to devote all your attention to the extra space; if you can gain enough territory, your opponent might end up getting squeezed to death. Unfortunately, White made no real effort to dissect this position and his moves will eventually reflect this.
9.O-O O-O
1413: "Black would like to trade pieces and relieve his cramp. I will play d4-d5 to gain space in the center and, if he takes, I get an open c-file."

Not bad, but he is basing his play on Black opening the c-file for him. You can't expect your opponent to do what you want him to do.
10.d5 a5
1413: "I willplay a2-a4 to control b5 and shut his queenside play down." What queenside play? Just because Black pushed his pawn to a5 doesn't necessarily mean that he has play on the queenside. Actually, White could dictate matters on that side of the board with l l .a3 followed by 12.b4 with lots of territory. Instead of this logical, positive continuation, he begins to react to the opponent. l l.a4? Handing over the b4- and c5-squares for no reason whatso ever. The recommended l 1 .a3 followed by 12.b4 leaves White in control of both these points. 11 .. . h6 1413: "Black wants to play . . . Bh7 and . . .g7-g5 and get more space on the kingside. I'm also looking at the kingside and Ng3, which eyes f5." As usual, 1413 falls victim to the amateur malady of "King fear." Amateurs always think that the opponent wants to start a mating attack (which Black had no intention of doing), while White dreams of doing the same thing to Black's King!
12.Ng3 Nc5
1413: "He wants to take the d3-Bishop and maybe play . . . Na6-b4. I'll shut that down with Bxc5 and leave him with two inactive Bishops." Why would Black want to capture the bad piece on d3 with his fine c5-Knight? White's idea of playing for a superior minor piece deserves praise, but his reason for doing so was based on fear; fear of a threat (. . .Nxd3) that Black would never have done!

You only get real pressure on the enemy position if you can attack a point with several of your pieces.

I will prepare for f4 by Nce2. " Now he loses focus and forgets about his reasons for the capture on cS. Originally he wanted to leave Black with two inactive Bishops (actually, the Bishop on e7 is bad. The guy on g6 is good by definition but is obviously doing very little) but now he goes for f3-f4, a move that opens the position and frees the e7- Bishop. 1 5.Nce2 Nd7 1413: "Right now, Black has the Bishop pair. His dark sisquared Bishop is bad but my Bishop stinks. My g3-Knight more active than his and I have more central space. It's pretty even over all. I will go ahead with the pawn push." He said some good things but what did all those factors have to do with him pushing his f-pawn? Nothing at all! Only play moves that highlight your positive imbalances. t6.f4? 1413: "Trying to open up my Rooks." His 16.f4 did open the f-file for his Rooks but it also activated Black's dark-squared Bishop, gave Black play on the e-file and allowed the Black Knight to take up residence on eS.

To avoid the unfortunate spiral into the abyss (be it on the board or in one's mind) that these amateur's experienced, I give these additional recommendations: > Don't look at your opponent's rating before the game. This prevents you from freezing up and getting into a defensive "I want to draw" type of mindset. Once you convince yourself that the opponent is a chess god, you might as well resign and take up knitting. Treat every one you play with a touch of contempt! There is noth ing a higher rated player hates to see more than an opponent who refuses to be respectful to a superior. A positive "win at all costs" attitude will add at least 1 50 rating points to your stats! > Always have a plan and never forget that the only plan that matters is yours. The opponent's ideas should be treated as nothing more than minor annoyances; swat them away jf they start to sting, and then go back to what you were doing. Now let's explore two other subjects: giving up and depres sion. Sometimes things don't go the way we wanted and we find that defeat appears to be looming. Depressed over this state of affairs, we make a few hopeless moves and accept our fate. Don't let this happen to you! Fight back! Often we have more play than we supposed but we are trapped in a negative mindset and become blind to these promising possibilities. I remember

one game in which I had been suffering for a long time. Finally I couldn't stand the abuse anymore and so I resigned. Looking at me as if I were a vegetable, my opponent (a well-known Grandmaster) said: "What are you doing?" "I'm giving up. It's lost." "Lost? I was about to offer a draw. You have an immediate perpetual check!" When I heard this, I felt like a blindfold had been tom from my eyes.

This position shows despair in action. My student (1685) felt a deep sense of hopelessness when he looked at this situation, and a glance might tell us that this negative attitude was justified. Black is two pawns down, he is not castled, his Knight is pinned to his King and Nc6 looms as a powerful threat. In the game, Black saw the Queens were going to be traded (not something you normally want when you are down material), but since there was no apparent way out he opted for 1 . . .Qc7?? which at least attacked the Knight and stopped Nc6. However, after 2.Qxd7+ Qxd7
3.Nxd7 Kxd7 4.Na3 followed by 5.O-O-O White enjoyed good
winning chances.

All his thoughts smacked of defeatism because Black only concentrated on the negative qualities of his position. He never bothered to ask what was right about his game. Though material down, he is ahead in development and has chances of an attack abandsed on the weakened light-squares on f3 and d3. If the Queens Knights go off, these attacking chances evaporate, so you nust find a way to retain your army and make use of the advantages you have.
1. .. Rxb7!!
This stops Nc6 and breaks the pin along the a4-e8 diagonal. r:t's true that Black loses some more material (not that much, though-just a Rook for a Knight and pawn), but he is able to train his sights upon the weakened light-squares in White's camp. . . . N2.Qxb7 Nxe5 and all of a sudden White is facing threats of f3+ and . . . Nd3+ . This turns the game around and leaves Black Vfith a very powerful attack. Material doesn't matter; Black had already sacrificed a couple of pawns for the advantages just listed and throwing out some more ballast should not make him blink. J'he moral? Don't go along with the opponent's agenda! Don't allow yourself to be herded around like a sacrificial lamb! Look bard for the plusses in your position and insist on making use of them. So far, we have only discussed a negative, defeatist attitude . 'What about overconfidence? Can that be a problem? Most defi nitely! When you fall into the trap of overconfidence, you cease to concentrate properly. You "know" you are going to win and, as a result, stop looking at the board in an honest manner. This lack of attention makes you miss ways to finish up the game quickly and leaves you open to tricks, traps and time-pressure blunders.

(1 17) Caluag-Burtman, Los Angeles 1993. White to play. Black, an expert, was the higher-rated player and had been in control of the game the whole way. Burtman's advantage in space and the lack of coordination of the enemy pieces had convinced her that the win of material (the b6-pawn) and a quick victory were within reach. A few moves earlier she had been right, but she had fallen asleep during her last few turns and lost all sense of danger. After all, what could the opponent (a 1900 player) possibly do to her here? The answer proved to be a rude shock.
1.Bxa6!
All of a sudden, the White army is working together rather well! A safe advantage for Black has turned into an unpleasant tactical mess. 1 . . .bxa6
2.Qe2

� 1 4 / T H E A MA T E U R ' S M I N D
After the initial shock, Black once again became confident of h.er win and once again tunes out the tactical possibilities in the position. Here White, who was playing in a desperate frame of mind, gave in to the will of his opponent and somehow eventually lost after 6.Bxb4 cxb4 7.Rcl?? (missing an instant win by 7.b7 vvhen there is no answer to the threat of 8.Ra6) 7 . . . Rc8. However, White could have stolen a memorable point in another way:
6.d.xc5 Qxc5 7.Rxe7+! Qxe7 8.Bxb4 Qd7 9.Qc5 (threatening
]_ O.Qd4) with material equality and a winning attack. It's funny, but both players were so stuck in their roles (Expert defeats Class "A" player) that neither was aware of the fact that Black was on the brink of extinction. I am quite sure that if the rdes had been reversed, Sharon would have seen the danger. As Black, however, these lines were completely invisible to her simply because she had lulled herself to sleep--her overconfi dence (which translates to a lack of vigilance) chopped hundreds of points off her strength. Tips * A bad attitude will always lead to bad results. * Don't concentrate on what is wrong with your game. Concentrate on what is right with it and insist on making use of those positive imbalances. * It's great to be confident, but overconfidence can easily lead to a fatal loss of vigilance. * The game is not over until the opponent has re signed. Take pride in finishing the enemy off with gusto and never allow counterplay that might turn the battle around.

VY e don't have to go over this game, I already know where I went wrong. " I've heard this line from students for many years now, and in virtually every case, I find that their view of the game's errors was based on an opening mistake or a major tactical blunder. When I point out subtle errors (which are far more common and more important than mere blunders), they are often amazed to find that I'm criticizing moves and ideas that they were proud of in the actual game. Ideally, one of the best ways to improve is to play a tournament game, deeply annotate it while trying to unearth the inaccuracies by both sides, and then show those annotations to a skilled chess teacher. The information this teacher will (hope fully!) bring to your attention will prove to be invaluable. The following tests allow you to practice this technique.

30 � T H E AMAT E U R ' S M I N D
Everyone has seen the term "losing the thread" in Grandmaster notes. It usually refers to a player who loses concentration and fails to understand what's really going on in the midst of a heavy battle . One useless move after another gets banged out and suddenly a good position, or even a winning one, quickly unravels into a ball of chaotic twine. This dreaded "thread" affliction tends to be psychological in nature . You get a nice position, you relax (evidently thinking that it vill play itseID, one bad move leads to another (panic may set in at this point!) and suddenly you "wake up," only to discover that it's far too late. Though everyone falls victim to this syndrome from time to tir.ne, steps can be taken to avoid it. The first thing you must do is to always INSIST on understanding the position to the best of your abilities. No position will play itself and, no matter how huge your advantage may be, almost any position can be lost if you set your mind to it. Never tell yourself that you're winning. Doing this trivializes the technical process and can easily lead to "thread disease. " Instead, learn to take great pride in pushing your opponent off the be>ard in the safest and most economical fashion. In other words, when your position gets good, work twice as hard as you did ea:dier! Class "A" player-Class "B" player. Los Angeles, 1998. Sicilian Accelerated Dragon.
1.e4 c5

4.Nxd4 g6
This opening, known as the Accelerated Dragon, has long been a favorite of mine and many of my students.
5.Bc4
T E S T S O LU T I ON S I 331
A rare move. White deprives himself of the "Maroczy Bind" (c2-c4) and, in addition, gives Black some original and highly tempting options. 5 ...Qa5+ I'm quite fond of this strange-looking move. Black tries to take immediate advantage of White's loose pieces on c4 and d4.
6.Bd2?
This is supposed to be an error (both 6.c3 and 6.Nc3 are better), but White flicked it out so fast that Black suddenly became convinced that his opponent had prepared the whole line. I suspect that part of this paranoia was forged by White's higher rating. If the first player had been rated 1200, Black would have accepted that his opponent didn't know what he was doing. However, since White was a mighty "A" player, Black has trouble believing that "big A" could make this kind of mistake so quickly! Now, thanks to this self-imposed psychological burden, Black finds it difficult to take his mind off his opponent and onto the board. 6 ... Qc5 Black knew this move was supposed to be good. What had White cooked up?
7.Bc3
A good try in a bad situation. Both 7.Nxc6 Qxc4 (winning the e4-pawn) and 7.NbS Qxc4 8.Nc7+ Kd8 9.Nxa8 Qxe4+ (when the a8-Knight will never make it out alive), are worse. 7 .. . Qxc4

Blacl: knew he was doing well, but his trepidation about the openlng still left some residual doubt bouncing around in his head This led to a state of confusion, and Black plays the rest of the game poorly. Having won material, Black should have calmed down and focu�ed himself to the task at hand. If you have the time, clearing your head with a small walk works wonders. Instead, he stayed seated, decided that he had to develop (hardly a deep assessment of the position!), and tossed his Knight out into the storm.
T E S T S O L U T I O N S I .3 33
Better was the obvious 12 . . .d6 when 13 . . . Nf6 would have worked rather well. White's problem is that he doesn't have anything to attack in the Black position. Of course, Black should also be looking for ways to create targets in White's camp (this kind of basic thinking should not stop just because you've won material!). By moving his pawn to d6, he tells White that an e4-e5 advance will either lose a pawn or leave the first player with a weak e-pawn after . . . dxe5. Having nullified e4-e5, Black could then have developed in peace. Plans like . . .b7-b5-b4 would have eventually blasted open some lines and highlighted the superior ity of Black's minor pieces over the White Queen.
13.e5 Nd5
14.Nc4
Suddenly Black's Knight is hanging out to dry, his g7-Bishop is blocked, and the c8-Bishop still can't get out of its cage. Black's still doing well, but these unexpected problems begin to drive home his earlier doubts.

Black's forces are not working together in any cohesive manner, and curing that problem (not grasping for material gains) �hould have been his main priority. This is an important thing to think about! The creation of a unified plan should always 'take precedence over a random gain of material.

Tips * Always INSIST on understanding the position to the best of your abilities. * No position will play itself. * No matter how huge your advantage may be, almost any position can be lost if you set your mind to it. * Never tell yourself that you're winning. Just work as hard as possible and keep your mind centered (the victory celebration only starts after the game!). * Everyone blunders. If your opponent goes crazy, don't give him supernatural powers and decide that he can see mystical strands of energy that are invisible to you. Take the offered "gifts," look him straight in the eye, and dare him to do his worst! * A confident, defiant opponent makes the bravest (and highest-rated) player entertain a nagging doubt about his skills and yours. * The creation of a unified plan should always take precedence over a random gain of material. r n I T H E A M A T E U R ' S M I N D It has often been said that it takes more than one mistake to lose a ch�ss game. Though this may not be true at the highest levels of the game, in general, we can agree that a typical amateur contest is fill�d with errors. Having embraced this truth, most players should be happy to realize that they will get several chances to win almost ev�ry game. Yes, you may have been the first to blunder, but somewhere, at some time, your opponent is going to slip up and give you an opportunity to claw your way back into the game. The trick is, you must believe this with all your heart or you won't be on the lookout for those hard-to-see moves that WILL ari se. A despondent, mentally-beaten player will actually find a way to lose, even if one win after another magically appears and screams to be noticed! This brings us to an interesting statement:
THE WINNER
IS THE PLAYER WHO MAKES THE NEXT
TO LAST MISTAKE!
Our next key point centers around psychology. If you feel that you are winning, don't refuse to pull the trigger just because your opponent is higher rated than you. Get angry, become stubborn; INSIST on coming up with a proper method of execution. Whatever you do, don't get cold feet when your instincts tell you that the game should be won. This line of reasoning takes us to our second point:
RESPECT NO OPPONENT!
So far I've painted a picture of a player (in a worst-case scenario) who goes into a game thinking that he really doesn't stand much chance of winning (fear of the higher-rated oppo nent) and also thinks that the guy sitting across the table is perfect and won't make any real mistakes (showing a complete lack of realism). This becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy since such a player really won 't stand any chance! The following game illustrates all of these points: The "mighty" higher-rated player (Black) indulges in a planless opening. Then
T E S T S O L U T I O N S I 337
White (a "B" player) tosses his advantage out the window. Not to be shown up, the 2100-player once again falls into the gutter and soon has a resignable position. Not quite believing his luck (in other words, not believing that his opponent could really play so badly), White refuses to win the game, making one error after another until he becomes a mentally-beaten husk. This psycho logical collapse leads to yet another victory for the rating system. Makarewicz-Darias (1780-2140), Los Angeles 1998. Torre Attack.

2.N.f3 e6

5.Bd3
The ever-popular Torre Attack: dynamic, easy to learn and fun to play. Who could ask for more in an opening system?
5 . . . O-O
6.O-O
Natural but inaccurate. Better is 6.Nbd2 when 6 . . . cS 7.c3 Nc6 could be met by 8.NeS with a nice game for White. The trick to this opening (from White's point of view) resides in control over e5. When Black moves his b8-Knight to d7 or c6 he threatens to "win" eS with . . . Qc7. White can't allow this! In general, White must be ready to meet . . .Nc6 or . . .Nbd7 with Ne5 when the threat of f2-f4 clamps down on es and gives him good chances on the kingside. 6 . . . c5
7.c3 Nc6
8.Nbd2 b6?!
Missing his chance. White's opponent has just demonstrated that he doesn't understand the position at all. Correct was 8 . . .Qc7 when the threat of 9 . . . eS guarantees Black good chances (note that 8 . . . Qc7 9.Bf4 Bd6 won't help White). It's important to point out that Black has fallen into a very dan_gerous men ta I tr.::i

clear plan in mind. Such a "strategy" will usually lead to real rrouble. Naturally, you should train yourself to avoid this kind of lazy thinking.
9.Qe2
White isn't aware of the Ne5 idea. Naturally, 9.NeS would still bave been good. White was familiar with the Colle and thought he �as playing that opening (and its plan of preparing for e3-e4) with the Bishop on gS. 9 .. . cxd4? A poor move that opens the e-file for White and cuts down on Black's options. In effect, Black is trading his good c5-pawn for White's passive e3-pawn!
10.exd4
An excellent response that happily breaks the "always capture towards the center" rule. By leaving his pawn on c3, White keeps the enemy Knight off of b4 and opens up the e-file for future operations.
10. .. h6
1 1.Bh4 Bb7 Still getting his pieces out with no plan in mind. In this kind of position, Black should be playing for a minority attack via an eventual . . . b6-b5-b4 (creating open lines and weaknesses in White's queenside structure).
12.Ne5?
Much too early. What's the rush? Black can't really do much of anything so White would have been well advised to continue building up in the center and on the kingside. One plan (of many) was 12.Rfel followed by 1 3.Radl, Bbl and Qd3 with storm clouds brewing on the kingside.
12. ..Nxe5
13.Qxe5
More tempting is 1 3.dxeS but Black would suddenly spring to life with 13 . . . Nd7 14.Bg3 Nc5 when 15.Bc2 is met by 1 5 . . . Ba6.
T E S T S O L U T I O N S I .3 39
What has White accomplished by his early 12.NeS? The first thing that catches my eyes is White's willingness to exchange Black's passive c6-Knight for White's more useful beast on f3 (the side with more space should not exchange pieces). I am also disturbed by White's joy in placing his Queen on an exposed square. Never initiate an exchange unless you can clearly list the thing(s) you are gaining!
13...Nd7
Suddenly White is being herded in a direction that he may not . have wished to take.
14.Bxe7 Nxe5
15.Bxd.8 Nxd3
16.Be7 Rfe8
17.Ba3
Black has managed to trade off several pieces and now, thanks to the opposite-colored Bishops, enjoys an even game. However, now we can see the differences between the two players: while White was happy to trade off from a superior game to a even one, Black wants to push the envelope as far as possible. Seeing his d3-Knight as a strong piece, and also recognizing that the make-up of the game has suddenly changed, Black tries to extract the maximum from the position. This noble goal (in chess, any greedy goal is noble!) falls flat when White suddenly wakes up and begins to play brilliantly!
17. . .b5?
Planning 18 . . . aS and 19. . .b4. Unfortunately for Black, this move blocks the a6-d3 diagonal (which stops Black from defend ing his Knight with . . . Ba6) and leaves the Knight in sudden danger!
18.f4
Forcing Black to address the threat of 19.Rf3. 18 .. . g5
3 4 0 I T H E A M A T E U R ' S M I N D
Taken aback, Black weakens his kingside, not believing that White will find a way to take advantage of this flaw. The more natural 18 . . . aS 19.Rf3 b4 fails to 20.Rxd3 bxa3 21 .b3 when White will eventually scoop up the a3-pawn with Nd2-blxa3.
19.fxg5 hxg5
20.Rf6
White sees a very interesting idea and, in his excitement, misses Black's best response. Better was 20.g3, taking the f4- square away from the Knight.
20. ..
Nf4?? This lands Black in serious trouble. Correct was 20. . .Kg7 when 21 .Rafl ? (White should play 21.Rf3) loses material to 2 1 . . . Nf4. Notice how each side makes one mistake after another, always letting the opponent escape from fate. P ro b l e m P o s i t i o n (1 43)

21.Bd6
The main imbalance in the position is the opposite colored Bishops. Once White's Bishop reaches eS, it will dominate the game by laying claim to all the weak dark squares in Black's camp. Compare this piece with Black's pathetic alter ego on b7. 21 . . . Nh5
22.Rh6!
Excellent! White suddenly creates a mating attack. 22 .. . Ng7 No better was 22 . . .Nf4 23.BeS Ng6 24.Bf6 when Black can't make a move. After 22 . . . Ng7, White has a completely won game. He realized that he was in charge but he suddenly became worried about the horrible 23 . . .fS (as he put it: "And Black gains space."). Strange, don't you agree? With a strong attack blazing, and threats mount ing with every move, White stops in his tracks and becomes paranoid that the opponent must have something good (would White think like this if Black was rated 1200?).
23.Rf6n
In White's mind, he was stopping two Black threats: 23 . . .NfS (forking Bishop and Rook) and 23 . . .fS ("gaining space"). Correct, of course, was 23.BeS (meeting 23 . . . NfS with the reasonably strong 24.Rh8 mate) when Black is busted. For example, the feared 23 . . .fS (threatening nothing and weakening e6 and eS) gives White various strong replies like 24.Nf3 g4 25.NgS or 24.Rg6 Re7 when White has a couple ways to win material. 23 .. .

Bf3+ 35.Kd2 Nc4+ 36.Kd3 (avoiding 36.Kc2?? Be4 mate) 36 . . . Be4+ 37.Ke2 and Black doesn't have more than a perpetual check with 37 . . .Rb2+. 34 ...Bf3+
35.Kd2 Nc4+, 0-1. White didn't care what was going on
anymore; he'd had enough and just wanted to get away from a bad memory. A sane look at the position would have convinced him that 35.Kd3 Kxf7 (35 . . . Be4+ 36.Ke2) 36.gxf3 was worth playing out. Did you notice the emotional decline in White's play? Com pare it to Black's never-say-die attitude and you will understand why Black ended up winning this game. Tips * The winner is the player who makes the next to last mistake. * In chess, never respect anyone! Every player, no matter how high his rating, is waiting to be dragged down and dismembered. * If you don't give off an air of confidence, your opponent will sense your weakness and beat you like a drum. * Never develop your pieces in the opening with the intention of looking for a plan later. When "later" comes, you are usually on your way down. * The side with more space should not exchange pieces. #3

Black's passed pawns appear to be very dangerous, but White's firm blockade on c3 and d2, combined with the active Rook on bS, allows the first player to more than hold his own. At the moment, the passed pawns aren't going anywhere because the d3-pawn is firmly blocked by the White King and the c3-square is also under White's domination. To break this down, Black has to achieve a workable . . . c4-c3+ at some point, or he must try and achieve a Bishop check along the g5-d2 diagonal ( . . . BgS+).

Now White's King gains access to d2 and Black is suddenly the one who will have to play for the draw. White was saved by his nimble Rook. Always insist that your Rooks perform in the same active manner! # 5 Tips * The defending side should always try and trade pawns on one side of the board. 'fP.is leaves him with a much smaller area to defend and less targets to worry about. * Making sure your Rooks stay active is one of the most important concepts in Rook endgames! * Passed pawns must be blockaded at all costs! * Take away the activity of the enemy forces. We live in a fast-food nation; everything has to be handed to us quickly and easily. This may explain why so many players are consumed with a desire to know their openings inside and out. So, forget about middlegame study. Forget about the endgame. Memorization is the key for these "sit down, win fast and get up" mentalities. However, what about old dudes like the author who don't have a memory (youngsters who can't remember anything may also

include themselves), think the words "win fast" spring from some other language and actually enjoy playing a long, thoughtful game? The funny thing about opening study is that all the memoriza t:ion in the world won't help you if you can't play the other phases in a strong manner; a player who understands middlegame strategy will usually come out on top against an opening expert. Another karmic opening lesson involves this simple truth: you ruay memorize all the key opening lines, but your opponents con't know these variations-they will always step away from the book and leave both of you in the dark! When that happens, isn't uknowing how to actually play the game the thing that will ltimately count? Before I overreach by stepping out of the bounds of opening t:1ought, let's take a glance at a book review by IM John Watson and see what he has to say about opening study: "What do most readers look for in an opening book? Unfortunately, something that they won't get. 1WIC [Mr. Watson is referring to The Week In Chess, a web-site that gives up to the minute chess news] readers, for example, apparently want pretty much what my own students keep asking for: a book which explains all the 'ideas' of an opening, but isn't cluttered up with all sorts of nasty variations which one will never run into over the board anyway. "I'm sorry to report that this is just a fantasy. Learning an opening by accumulating abstract ideas is a little like learning a language by reading a grammar book. Worse, actually, because generalizations in chess don't apply with nearly the consistency or predictability of grammatical rules. "If a chess opening could be learned by absorbing the opening's 'ideas' (whatever those might be), the opening phase of the game would be universally mastered and of little interest . The fact is, no verbal description of what squares are important or where the pieces 'usually' go can describe the dynamic interplay of tactics and positional factors in any major opening. Whereas, by contrast, the straightforward study of enough examples will lead to a nuanced and practical knowledge of how to play that opening. In addition, by studying in context, you will automatically get a much better grasp on how those impor- 4 11 1
T E S T S O L U T I O N S I 353
tant squares and typical maneuvers work than you would have from reading a general description." What in the world is Mr. Watson talking about? His first paragraph says that the study of opening ideas won't get the job done (which, I am told, enraged many of his readers . . .hey guys, chill out a bit!), while he later says that learning these abstract concepts by the study of actual games (compared to general descriptions) will indeed give you a good grasp of the system you wish to master. In other words, he's giving good advice (which he usually does) in a way that managed to confuse many people. Parroting general concepts like a sleep-deprived Moonie is indeed a menu for disaster (but going back to our lazy fast-food mentality, that's what many players yearn for). But learning the correct plans for your particular system (which includes the correct squares for your pieces, the correct middlegame ideas, typical traps and structural problems, and even typical endgames that arise from your opening) is far superior to the soulless memorization that most books seem to insist on. Up to this point, the main piece of advice is to study master games so you get a feel for the "complete story" of your opening system (opening, middlegame and endgame). Two other bits of chess wisdom, though, will prove useful to the reader: > In the opening, middlegame and endgame, your opponents will invariably give you sizable oppor tunities to knock them for a loop (or, at the very least, to make modest but important gains). To make use of these chances, though, means that you must spot them and pounce when they arise (and they will arise!). > While playing the opening (whether you know what you're doing or not), don't allow yourseH to get lazy and try to stay flexible (don't make a decision on one move only to realize you want to do something else a short time later. Both laziness and flexibility often go hand in hand). Though vague, these ideas will (hopefully ) be clarified in -7

2.Nf3 e6
3.Bg5 Be7
So far we have a very simple position. Now White has to make some basic decisions. Should he place his pawn on e3 or would he like to get that pawn to e4? Does he want to play the game like a normal Queen's Gambit Declined (via c2-c4 and Nc3) or does he prefer the warm confines of a Torre Attack (where the c-pawn usually finds rest on c3)?
4.e3
An innocent looking move, but White not only shows a lack of flexibility, he also demonstrates that he hasn't decided what he wants to do (laziness). If it was White's intention to keep this pawn on e3, then there's nothing wrong with his fourth move. But if he wanted to place it on e4, then 4.Nbd2 (threatening 5.e4 and staying flexible) is obviously superior. This means that 4.e3 isn't a bad move by itself, but it turns out to be a bad decision when we see what White really had in mind. 4 ...h6
5.Bxf6?
A really strange decision. Having committed to e2-e3, White should have calmly moved his Bishop back to h4. The only reason one would take on f6 is to gain time for the e4-advance, but White's fourth move has already ruled that out. 5 . . .Bxf6
6.e4
We've now reached a well-known book position with an extra tempo for Black (White should have the free Nbd2 in here). It's clear that White's e2-e3-e4 showed a propensity for laziness that must somehow be eradicated from his chess character. 6 . ..

Correct was 7 . . .g6 followed by 8 . . . d6, . . . Bg7, . . . b6, . . . Bb7 and . . .Nbd7. This formation takes all the advanced squares away from White's Knights (following Steinitz's anti Knight rule) and prepares the central opening . . . c7-c5 advance.

1 1.c4 Though White played c2-c3 a few moves earlier, the c3-c4 advance is a good idea. The reason lies in that often quoted pawn pointing theory: Black's pawns aim at the kingside while White's aim at the queenside. Thus Black will play against White's King with . . . f7-f5 (thanks to the closed center) and White will strive to open queenside lines with an eventual c4-c5 advance. 11 ...Ng6

At this point, Black forgot the book moves and was on his own. However, not knowing the book wasn't a huge problem because he understood the nature of the position: Black's a pawn down but he has an easy development, pressure on the half-open d-file against White's backward d-pawn, and control over the very nice d4-square. 7 . .. g6!? The book move is 7 . . . Be7. However, the move played makes good sense: Black prepares to place his Bishop on the fine g7-c3 diagonal. In doing so, he'll gain even greater control over the d4- square.

with hS and Nfl-h2-g4 to follow. Though acquainted with the general ideas and set-up of the King's Indian Attack, his knowledge proved to be a double-edged sword. He would do well if Black played the moves just given, but if Black varied in some significant manner, White would often repeat the same plan and moves even if it no longer had any point! This teaches us that basic ideas have value, but if you cling to them, they will tum to poison. Every new move by your oppo nent, whether it's good or bad, changes everything and must be looked at in a fresh manner. 2 ... d5

4.Ngf3 Bd6
It's now clear that Black doesn't have anything prepared and is just making things up as he goes. Since Black has wandered so far from the normal path, White should push aside his memorized setups and look for something particularly tasty. Instead, the first player just tosses out his usual moves.

Black has closed up the center while White (with the exception of the aggressive 8.Nc4) has followed his pre-game recipe. On the eighth move it became clear to White that he wasn't in E:.ansas anymore. Finally (and, undoubtedly, with a heavy heart) l1e pushed his hoped-for setup aside (it's hard for White to advance his pawn to eS when Black's pawn stands there!) and looked for something else to do. How would one go about making a decision for White? Two t:hings stand out: 1) Black hasn't castled yet. 2) White can grab the two Bishops with Nxd6 . The fact that Black hasn't castled calls for an immediate, aggressive reaction and an opening up of the central position. Gaining the two Bishops is a long-range plan. White would still want to open the position for his Bishops, but he could go about his plans in a calmer manner.
9.Nxd6+
White goes for the Bishops, though at the moment Black's d6- Bishop was hardly a wonderful piece. Personally, I would have preferred 9.c3!, striking at Black's center and initiating a fight � ,h ; l .c. th.c. -r:tJ,, ,.-1,. mr\n<1 rrh i <: <:till � lbhilitv

9 . . . cxd6 An error, but I have to give him credit for not fearing doubled pawns. Black's move actually makes a lot of sense: it firmly defends eS and opens the c-file for his Rooks (once again proving that doubled pawns are often a very good thing). Unfortunately, White can cast doubt on Black's concept. to.b3n Absolutely awful. White is hoping to put pressure on d6 by Ba3, but the price he pays for this is too high. What is that price? A gaping hole on c3 and a backward pawn on c2. Don't create such weaknesses in your own position! Correct was 10.c3!, letting Black dissolve his doubled. pawns. Black could then play either 10. . . dxc3 1 1.bxc3 when White's two Bishops and mobile center give him a clear advantage, or 10 . . . Bg4 l l .h3 Bxf3, when White possesses two Bishops versus two Knights. White was caught up in the idea that doubled pawns are bad, and so the idea of letting Black rid himself of them never occurred to him. However, why are those doubled pawns bad? The pawn on d6 is safely defended by the Queen and gives useful support to eS. The pawn on d4 is like a rock, and it gains quite a bit of space. 10 . . . Bg4?! What does this have to do with the newly created weaknesses on c3 and c2? From this point on, every move Black plays should be aimed at those two targets in the White position. ll.Ba3? Still barking up the wrong tree. White should play 1 1 .Bb2 followed by 1 2.c3. If White wanted to insist on his chosen course, then l l.a4 first would have been better, creating an artificial support point on c4 for the Knight (Nf3-d2-c4 is in the air). ll . .. Qf6? The real targets lie on the queenside, but Black can't resist staring at the opposite wing.

Much better was 14 . . . a5 with the idea of 15 . . . a4. Note that 1-4 . . . a5 15.c3 isn't possible due to 15 . . . dxc3 16.Rxc3 b4, winning fJlaterial. Black's actual move ends all thoughts of a c2-c3 advance, but i 1 also gives up c4 to the White Knight. By allowing this, the c-file i> neutralized and White is free to seek out kingside play by f2-f4 ""'ithout fear of a queenside reprisal. By not making use of his queenside chances (and 14 . . .b4?? 1'ills Black's queenside play), Black allows White to take over the 1\ame on the other wing.
15.Bb2 O-O
t6.Nc4 Bc8? I can't comprehend this move. .Qe2 Nce7? Black's last couple of moves seem to be setting up a kind of "help-problem" (Black to play and hang his a8-Rook).

Completing the picture set up by . . .Bc8 and . . . Nce7. When you don't follow your correct plan (and Black ignored his queenside chances), you often end up with no plan at all. When this happens, random puttering about, mixed with blunders, often ensues.

What's the hurry? This move exchanges a dynamic c-pawn for White's passive e3-pawn. On top of that, Black lets White open up the e-file for his Rooks and also frees the blocked cl-Bishop.
6.exd4 d5
White can be very satisfied with the result of the opening. His pieces stare ominously at Black's kingside. Though we can clearly see that White will be playing for a kingside attack, Black's correct plan might be less clear. Kudos for those who noted that the second player should be preparing a minority attack via an eventual . . . Rb8, . . . b7-b5-b4. Don't forget the pawn-pointing theory here: White's pawns aim at the kingside and Black's point to the opposite wing.

White tries a different, but good, idea. The Knight gets out of the way and heads for g3 where it will participate in a kingside ;ittack.

This move weakens the kingside and sets up various themes involving tactical explosions on h6.

Too slow. Why not speed things up with 14.Ne3 (threatening NxdS) 14 . . . Bd7 15.Ng4 with kingside threats? Note how the Knight on g4 not only eyes the tactically weak squares on f6 and h6, it also keeps tabs on the key e5-square. 14 .. . Bd7

What's this? Black has finally figured out that his future lies on the queenside, but he seems happy to go about his business there as slowly as possible. The immediate 15. . .b5 is much more to the point, since 16.Qxb5? Nxd4 won't be to White's tastes.
16.a4?
White wanted to stop Black's play before continuing with his own. A noble idea, but 16.a4 doesn't stop anything. In general, attacks on opposite wings call for speed and a sense of urgency. Time becomes very important, and one wasted move often makes the difference between a win or a loss.

18.Nxh2 Na5
19.Nf3?
Unfortunate. White wants to place his Knight on eS, but his t-unnel vision causes him to miss many key points: > White should be playing for mate. > His Knight is a major attacking piece, trading it more or less dooms White's attack to failure. > The f3-square isn't the only way the Knight can reach e5. > White would like to place bis Bishop on f4 where it eyes both �ides of the board. > If White can get bis Queen to g3 (without allowing a trade of ladies, of course!), his attack would be bard to stop. > Playing the Knight to g4 hits b6, f6 and e5. That's a lot more than Nf3 does! > White should be will ing to make queenside conces sions in his desire for a killin g kingside blow. The reason for this is based on the fact that White Wil..L lose on the queenside in the long run. Thus, if he wants to survive, be MUST make bis kingside attack work. With all this in mind, White's correct course of action was
19.Ng4. One fanciful (but quite possible) line is 19 . . .bS 20.Qf3

I 11 one of the greatest chess books ever written, Tb e Life and Games of Mikhail Tai by Tai, the late World Champion discussed a game early in his career in which he was contemplating the s1crifice of a Knight. He tried calculating it from beginning to end cut got more and more confused as he studied the position. All of a sudden, he remembered a little ditty by Korney Chukovksy: ''Dh, what a difficult job it was to drag out of the marsh the bippopotamus. " At that point, with his clock ticking, Tal began to figure out jbaow one might get a hippo out of a swamp. "I remember how cks figured in my thoughts, as well as levers, helicopters, and even a rope ladder. After lengthy consideration I admitted defeat a; an engineer, and thought spitefully: 'Well, let it drown!' "Suddenly the hippopotamus disappeared. Straight away the 11osition did not appear to be so complicated. I somehow realized that it was not possible to calculate all the variations, and that the Inight sacrifice was, by its very nature, purely intuitive. Since it :1romised an interesting game, I could not refrain from making it." Throughout this book I've discussed various methods of getting �our chessic thoughts in order. I must admit that I'd forgotten Tal's Jlippo technique, though Alexander Kotov (author of the classic rhink Like a Grandmaster), upon hearing of its existence, begin to -vrite a book on the subject titled TbinkLike aHippopotamus. Sadly, (Jrandmaster Kotov died before completing the work. Though it's very useful to empty your mind (as the Hippo ..lictates) when confused by a chess position, taxes or the ravings of the opposite sex, this device isn't sufficient to form a complete system. Due to this, we'll look at the following positions from the ?Oint of view of imbalances. I want you to answer three questions about this example (in this order): 1) What are allthe imbalances? 2) What side of the board should both you and your opponent play on? 3) What is the best move or plan based on the answers to the first two auestions?
T E S T S O L U T I O N S I 3 7 5
P r o b l e m P o s i t i o n (153) White to play. What are allthe imbalances? What side of the board should both you and your opponent play on? What is the best move or plan based, naturall y, on the answers to the first two questions? S o l u t i o n Okay, so you see that the fl-Rook has to be moved. But don't you dare touch it until you have answered those three questions posed earlier! Need a bit of help? All right, let's do them together. Our first question is: What are all the imbalances? Black has two Bishops, but the g7-Bishop isn't very active. The a6-Bishop looks good at first glance, but it's not working with the rest of it's army to fulfill any goal or plan. Other imbalances are pretty obvious: White has more central space and he also has the better pawn formation. The next question is: What side of the board should both you and your opponent play on? The center is closed, so neither player can initiate action in that sector of the board. White's pieces are aimed at the kingside, and his eS-pawn hits the weakened f6- square. So kingside play will be a definite part of White's future. Who is master of the queenside? Black's pawn weaknesses in that area don't inspire confidence for the second player. For
3 7 6 ! T H E A M A T E U R ' S M I N D
example, the hole on c S might make a nice home for White's Knight someday. Finally, we're forced to come up with a specific move or plan. Since we have plusses on both wings, wouldn't it be nice to dominate everywhere? Black won't be able to get anything going Otl the queenside if we can stop him from playing . . . c6-c5. So we have to keep an eye out for that (a timely b2-b4 freezes those doubled c-pawns!). The kingside is our domain. Bishop moves Uke Bf4-g5-f6 are possible, and the simple Bh6 is also in the air. That only leaves one problem: our threatened Rook! Where to nove it? The answer is 1 .Rfel. This innocent-looking move does a couple of very important things! Aside from getting the Rook to a safe square, it overprotects the eS-pawn. Overprotection is a 11rophylactic maneuver, and its point here is to stop Black from c:ver getting frisky in the center with . . . f7-f6. With our Rook, 1\ishop, d-pawn and Knight bearing down on eS, we ecstatically :answer . . .f6 with e:xf6 when Black has a weak pawn on e6 and a
1.uge hole on e5 (our Knight spends its spare moments dreaming
<if such a square!). So, after 1 .Rfel , Black is strategically lost because he doesn't :have play anywhere on the board. White will meet something like 1 . . . Qe 7 with 2. BgS, daring Black to play 2 . . .f6. The only difficulty 1he first player will have is deciding whether to go for a quick lingside kill (BgS followed by Qf4-h4 and then Bf6/Bh6 and NgS), �r mixing it with queenside torture with a well-timed Nf3-d2-b3- .:5. Also possible is a simple queenside snuff job with b2-b4, ending play there forever. Then White could pursue his kingside aspirations without worry. #12 (154)
T EST S O L U T I O N S I 377
P ro b l e m Pos i t i o n White to play. Is White doing allright in this position? What would you recommend? This position arose (White was an 1800 player while Black had a 1 900 rating) after 1.d4 Nf6 2.Nf3 g6 3.Bf4 (the Boring Variation of the KID) 3 • • .Bg7 4.e3 d6 5.h3 O-O 6.Be2 c5 7.O-O cxd4 8.exd4 Qb6 9.Nbd2 Be6 10.Nc4 Bxc4 11.Bxc4 Qxb2
12.Rbl Qc3 13.Qe2 Rc8.
S o l u t i o n The imbalances should be pretty easy to read if you make use of the imbalance list in the first chapter. White has two Bishops, active pieces and a nice lead in development. Black is up a pawn and is threatening to chop off our c4-Bishop. Aside from that, the second player has nothing to crow about. Since the position is so open, and since White's pieces have influence everywhere, White can get something going on the queenside (Rxb7), in the center (Qxe7) and on the kingside.
78 I' T H E A M AT E U R 0 S M I N D
The most important thing to understand is that White MUST make use of his favorable imbalances. Since he has a lead in time (development), he must play dynamically and try to get the most o-.it of it-once Black gets his own pieces out, White will be in tr<>uble due to his pawn minus. With this in mind, you should be looking for sharp, forcing continuations that keep your opponent off-balance. In the game, White found the nice:

The c7- and dS-squares must be watched, and the d6-pawn is weak. Since the center is open, White should try and play right down the middle (always play in the center if you can, it's the most important area of the board). With no negatives and some long-term plusses in space and superior pawn structure sitting in front of him, White should be patient and just build up his game with 1.Bh2 followed by 2.Rel .

So, how is White going to get some play, where is it going to be, and how should he deal with Black's upcoming demonstration? If I was White, I'd look for ways to get some central play (I LOVE to play in the center!). This can be done by 1.NdS followed by 2.c3 and 3.d4. Another idea is mixing central play with a kingside block by l .Ngl fS 2 .f3 with Nge2, Be3 and an eventual d3-d4 to follow. One other plan is 1.Nh4 fS 2.exfS gxfS 3.f4, starting a hand-to-hand fight in the same basic area. In the actual game, White showed that he didn't care what Black wanted to do. All he could think of was starting a "mating attack." Thus, the crazy (and completely unjustified) 1.h4? fS
2.Rhl? appeared on the board. At this point Black should probably
try 2 . . . h6, keeping White's pieces off of gS and preparing to meet
3.hS with 3 . . .gS (when it finally becomes clear that Black is boss
on the kingside!). Nevertheless, White did end up going down in flames. Hopefully he won't set himself on fire in the future. One thing I insist on when teaching a student is that he/she always plays for a win. This is obvious enough if your rating is 1500 and your opponent is only 900. However, courage starts to deteriorate when you get paired against someone with a 1900 rating! At that moment, you no longer play the opponent, you begin to play the rating and often give the person sitting aCrol;iS from you superhuman capabilities. The first thing every chessplayer must learn is that human beings make errors. If you go all out to give your opponent problems, an error can easily appear and a big, fat scalp can fall into your lap. The second key point for the winning player is that all non titled players (IMs and GMs being the titled guys) are capable of playing very, very badly. Why fear somebody who is quite capable of going berserk at any moment? Simply put, don't give respect to anyone due to rating. Make them earn that respect by waging all-out war!
82 / T H E AMAT E U R ' S M I N D
The third point for the winning player is that you really have nothing to lose! If you go all out every game, you will find that your wins come much more frequently. The worst thing that can happen to you is a defeat, and we all lose games no matter what happens and no matter who we play. A proper attitude gives you results that are far superior to anything you imagined you could achieve. In fact, confidence is worth one to two hundred rating points all by itself! One more bit of advice: If you are one of those players who plays below his normal standard when you get paired up, stop le>0king at the opponent's rating until after the game. This circumvents a lot of psychological baggage and allows you to play W'ith maximum confidence at all times. Let's take a look at the position in diagram #165 and see how t� lower-rated player reacts to his much stronger opponent. P ro b l e m P o s i t i o n (157) 1600-2100. White to play. Is White justified in playing 1.h4 in this position?
TE S T S O L U T I O N S I 383
S o l u t i o n This well-known position from the Torre Attack was new territory for the 1600 player and he took a long time here trying to figure out what was going on. Finally he realized that his chances were on the kingside due to his advanced pawn on eS and chances for a g2-g4 advance-this opens a file for his Rooks and follows the advice: Always play on the wings with pawns when the center is closed.
1.h4!
A great move that stops Black from advancing with . . . g7-g5 and also gains kingside space. I was proud of him for finding this far from obvious idea. 1 ...c4 This move attacks the White Bishop, gains queenside space and prepares a general queenside pawn advance (since White is going for the Black King, Black must stake out territory on the other wing). Its only flaw is that it creates a hole on the d4-square. Of course, Black has no intention of taking the h-pawn by 1 . . . Bxh4 since that would only open lines to his own King. 2.QhS would make Black extremely unhappy.
2.Bc2
An obvious move that took too much time to play! Instead of just making this simple retreat, White went into a panic about Black's space and sat there for ten minutes before giving in to the inevitable. 1600 often suffers from time pressure and this shows us why-he wastes time on moves that should be made quickly. Why? Because his lack of confidence makes him see ghosts around every comer. As it turns out, this seemingly innocent bit of hesitation was the first step in complete mental surrender! 2 . .. b5 Black grabs more queenside space and prepares to open lines on that side with . . . b5-b4. Notice how Black is trying to generate counterplay in the quickest way possible. This does two thinl!S'.
3.a3?!
">4 I T H E A M AT E U R · s M I N D
� It gives him a clear plan and his share of the play. � It can easily disturb White and make him lose confidence in his own plans. The first sign that everything is not right with White. In sit\lations where the play is on opposite wings, it is often fatal to ca "Ve in to the opponent's will and begin reacting to his plans to the exclusion of your own. White's fear of . . . bS-b4 grabbed his att:ention so forcefully that his head was permanently turned in th� direction of the queenside! Much stronger was 3.g4 (going all out for the Black King) or 3.Nf3. Let's have a look at 3.Nf3 (p lacing the Knight in a better position and eyeing both gS and d4 as future homes): 3 . . . b4 4.NgS Nc5 5.QhS h6 6.Qg6! hxgS 7.hxgS with the strong threat of 8.Rh8+!! Kxh8 9.QhS+ Kg8 10.g6 and mates (analysis by Tigran Petrosian) . In this analysis, White re.fused to be stared down by Black and, as a result, his attack crashed through first. 3 . . . Nc5 Brings the Knight up to a great square and eyes the holes on b3, d3 and e4.
4.h5?
A completely useless move that wastes time and actually weakens White's hold on the g5-square (if it doesn't open lines to the Black King it shouldn't be played). 4.hS? was White's one stab at attack but we must wonder why someone would play it if he originally planned g2-g4. The reason is purely psychological: White was so frazzled that any move that got near the Black King made him feel empowered. Thus White becomes another victim of emotion and panic . Naturally, both 4.g4 or 4.Nf3 were superior moves . 4 . . . a5 Prepares to worry White by preparing the . . . b5-b4 advance.

T E S T S O L U T I O N S I 385
Finally a logical move that actually improves his position. After his first fine move, White has been in a complete nose-dive. 5 ...Ba6 The immediate 5 . . .b4 failed due to 6.axb4 when the Black a pawn is pinned to its Rook. Now this pin doesn't exist and White can start to worry about Black's threats again.
6.Nd4
Improving the position of the Knight and eyeing both c6 and e6. Has White gotten back on track? 6 ... Qb6 This keeps the White Knight out of c6 and prepares to play . . . b4.
7.Rbl??
White snaps. Faced with a concrete threat, White goes bonkers and plays a move that actually does nothing at all. He really had to throw caution to the winds and play 7.g4 when Black would be forced to react to White's gestures of aggression on the kingside.
7... b4
Threatens to win a piece by 8 . . . b3 (courtesy of 7.Rbl??). Black's attack is much further advanced than White's so we won't look any further at this rather sad game. # 1 6 Riese-Carter (1482-1537), Continental Open 1996. Ruy Lopez.

A rare line (3 . . . a6 is more common) that prompts White into initiating a tactical flu rry.

P 1 o b l e m Po s i t i o n (158) White to play. Would 1.Bf4 be foolish here?
T E S T SO L U T I O N S I 3 87
S o l u t i o n In a way, this position was more or less reached by accident. Black got carried away with his material desires while White had no choice after missing . . . Qb6+ . Black is a pawn up but things are not all rosy. His King is still in the middle, he will lose time due to the vulnerable location of his Queen and he is considerably behind in development. All these things are dynamic in nature, though, and if Black can get castled and consolidate, his material plus will weigh in his favor.
10.Nc3!?
A logical move that brings a new attacker into position. Also interesting (and most likely strongest) was 10.Bf4!, a move White rejected due to 10 . . . Qxb2 (much worse is 10 . . . Qxe4?? 11 .Rel. Safest is 10. . . QcS+). However, White should not worry about the loss of another pawn or two, if Black is willing to keep moving his Queen, ignoring the needs of his other pieces. After l l.Nd2, White would be fully mobilized and ready for action.
10. ..Nf6
The Knight turns out to be vulnerable here. Preferable is 10 . . . Ne7 followed by . . . O-O. I don't think Black realized the danger he was in. l l.Bf4 White's final piece comes out and does two things: it attacks the Queen and prepares e4-e5. l l. .. Qc5+ This gives Black a crucial defensive tempo.
12.Khl d6
Black didn't like 12 . . . O-O 13.eS when the Knight is forced back to the poor e8-square. Now, after 12 . . .d6, White must find a way to keep his attack alive. If Black is able to castle and develop his Bishop, White's initiative will dissipate.
13.Nd5?
� <'i I T H E AMA T E U R ' S M I N D
This isn't the right medicine. Much more energetic was 13.eS!, blasting open the center and keeping Black on his toes. After 13 . . . dxeS? (Black has to try 13 . . . Ng4) 14.Bxe5 Black doesn't want to allow 15.Bxf6 . If 14 . . . Ng4 (and not 14 . . . QxeS?? 15.Rel, picking up the Queen) 1 5 .Bxg7 Rg8 (15 . . . Nf2+ 16.R.xf2 Qxf2 17.Bxh8) White wins material with 16.Rel +! Be6 17.Qxg4. 13 ...Nxe4?? Black goes berserk and opens lines to his own King. Correct was 13 . . . NxdS 14.exdS O-O when the King finds a safe haven. White now finishes up in a very efficient way:
14.Rel f5
15.b4
This makes use of the fact that Black's Queen has to keep an eye on the c7-pawn. 15 ... Qc4
16.Qd3!
Simple but pleasing. White would be quite happy to go into a piece up endgame after 16 . . . Qxd3 17.cxd3. 16 ... Qc6
17.b5 Qc5

Suddenly the Black Queen is trapped and the game is won. Black resigned in a few more moves. #1 7 P ro b l e m Po s i t i o n (159) K .t.

It should be noted that 1 . . . fS would have turned out very nicely for White after 2.exfS BxfS 3.Bd3 when White gets to use the e4-square as a home for his Knight.
2.Be2
This move jumps on the fact that g4 is no longer defended by a pawn. White doesn't mind the doubled g-pawns because he sees that the g3-pawn keeps the enemy Knight out of f4 and h4. I love White's mentality! Instead of seeing Black's kingside play as a threat, he is looking at it as a weakness! 2 . . . hxg3
3.hxg3 Kh7
Black has opened the h-file in his eternal dreams of mate. White continues to ignore his opponent.
4.Rfl
Clamping down on the fS-square and getting the Rook into a more active position. Also tempting was 4.Qdl . 4 . . . Rhs Black's Rook hopes to make the acquaintance of the White King. Will this worry his opponent?
5.Nb3
Laughing in Black's face! I'm not sure if the Knight is optimally placed here but White's desire to continue his queenside buildup and ignore his opponent's unsound kingside demonstration is admirable. Alternatives are S.aS, 5.Nc4, 5 .Qdl and S .c4 followed by 6.c5. 5 . . . Bh6 Black exchanges off his bad Bishop for White's good one. This trade was not prompted by positional acumen, though. Instead, Black realized that he could not mate with his Rook alone and, by getting rid of White's dark-squared Bishop, his Queen would have access to the gS-square.

Black has a very bad game due to his inferiority on the queenside and his weak pawns on g4 and f7. The immediate threat against g4 forces Black to either give up the pawn, play the groveling 7 . . . Qd7 or allow a Queen exchange by 7 . . .QgS 8.Qcl. 7 ... Kg7

7.O-O
So far, Black has handled the opening well. His next move, though, gives us the first hint about his true King-hunting psychosis. 7 . . . Bd6?? Awful. Black is so intent on aiming everything at White's King (I originally thought Black was trying to gain some control over e4 with his . . .b6 and . . . Bb7. Now I see that he had something much grander in mind!) that he ignores such "minor" things as central play and castling.

Threatening a big fork on eS. White doesn't need an invitation to grab the center with gain of time! 8 . . . cxd4
9.cxd4 Be7
Black admits that his first idea wasn't very good. It looks like he's going to settle down and play a real game of chess now.
10.a3
A very useful move. White keeps the Black Knight out of b4 and prepares to gain queenside space with a later b4 advance.
10. .. h5??
Black unleashes the full fury of his subconscious! Where he got such hatred for royalty is beyond me, but it's clear that only the White King's head will make him happy. This move demonstrates the desire to attack without any justification whatsoever. In the end, all it really does is weaken the gS-square, waste time and ignore the center.

12.Bb2
White continues to develop and build in the center and on the queenside. I often see amateurs react to Black's kingside gestures with moves like 12.h3, keeping Black's pieces off of g4. Why waste a tempo on a non-threat and why give Black something to aim at when he advances his pawns by . . . g7-g5-g4? Don't give Black's plan more respect than it deserves.
4 ) l' H E A MA T E U R ' S M I N D
12 . . .Rg8?? Yet another subtle move. I imagine flecks of aggressive foam fol'Clling on Black's lips as he looks at his opponent, hoping to see a q-uiver of terror or eyes wide with fear.

He was not happy here and instead of trying hard to give himself something to play for, he let his poor mood affect his choice of move.
8.Nxc6?
A bad move that exchanges off a good Knight and helps Black strengthen his central position by bringing the side pawn on b7 to the more central c6-square. If White had recognized that this was a key moment of the game (his unhappiness with the position should have clued him in), he might have tried harder and come up with a superior choice. Personally, I would have played 8.Nxg4 Nxg4 9.Be2 Nf6 (9 . . . Nxh2?? 10.g3 traps the greedy Knight) 10.O-O when the newly acquired two Bishops and the possibility of opening up the position for them by a later e3-e4 would have �iven White hooe for a oositive fut11rP
6 / TH E A M A T E U R ' S M I N D
Jf you chose 8.f4 (laying claim to the e5-square), then you did better than the game's 8.Nxc6 because your move at least does something positive. If your choice was 8.BbS (which fights for the initiative), Black will do well with 8 . . . Bd6. 8 . . . bxc6 �.Qa4 cxd4? This unfortunate and unnecessary move (what compelled Black to make this capture?) gives White a wonderful opportunity which, however, passed over the heads of both participants.
10.exd4?!
White plays the normal capture (he had been taught to always take with the e-pawn in this opening) and, because he wasn't thinking for himself, misses a rare chance to grab the advantage. The correct idea was 10.cxd4, opening a file toward the weakness on c6. White could then follow up with l l.Nb3, 12.Bd2 and Rel with considerable pressure against the Black position. Ho� could he have found this plan? The main sign that something was amiss should have been his feeling that White's game was not very promising after the move actually played. Why make a move if you don't like the result? Once you see thal your intended move lacks panache, place your nose to the . grindstone and look for something else! Once you see that you wa11t to tum c6 into a weakness, it shouldn't be too hard to find moves that bring all your pieces to bear on that specific point. The game continued as follows:

Now it's Black's turn to get excited. He has a huge lead in development and must be feeling the desire to throw some kind of knockout punch. Remember: a development lead is a tempo rary advantage and must be used before the enemy can catch up. These facts should have told Black that a key moment has arrived; how will he punish his opponent? The correct move (which Black failed to find) was 16 . . .eS!!, ripping the center open so that the Black pieces can reach the centrally placed White King. Then 17.NxeS Rx:eS+ 18.dxeS QxeS+ gives Black a raging attack since 19.Be2 Re8 picks up material while 19.Kdl Ne4 creates overwhelming threats against c3 and f2. Tips * You have to keep your eyes open for key moments in the struggle. * A key moment has arrived if you are poorly placed and need to find a move that gives you a new lease on life. * A key moment has arrived if you are in charge of the game and sense that it's time to search for a knockout blow. * The exciting moves that often arise from key posi tions can only be found if you make a conscious decision to look for them. This means that you must turn off the automatic pilot and try to make the position conform to your will. #20

An ciersson-Flaherty (1 588-1707), American Open 1 996. Dutch Defense.
1.d4 f5
The Dutch Defense is an aggressive opening that tends to do bener on the amateur level than on the international scene. Black's first move gains kingside space, fights for control over the im.J>ortant e4-square and prepares to place the g8-Knight comfort ably behind the f-pawn on f6. Its flaws include a weakening of the a2-g8 diagonal and the blocking of the c8-h3 diagonal (this often leads to difficulties for Black in developing his c8-Bishop).
2.c4
Already a big decision! Aside from popular alternative lines lik� 2.Nc3 (playing for a quick e2-e4) or 2.BgS (with the idea of 2 . _ .h6 3 .Bh4 g5 4.Bg3 f4? 5.e3! fxg3?? 6.QhS mate!), White usually tries the flexible 2.g3 Nf6 3.Bg2 when he can place his Knight on h3 or f3, depending on the system Black chooses. The reason Wliite holds off on c2-c4 until he is castled is simple: this avoids any worry about Black trying . . . e6 followed by . . .Bb4+. 2 • . . Nf6
3.Nf3 d6
Black shows his interest in a line known as the Leningrad Variation (if he plays 4 . . . g6). White's move order was mainly designed to punish the popular Stonewall Variation, which arises after 3 . . .e6 4.Nc3 dS, -with 5.Bf4! followed by 6.e3 when Black will always be a little worse. The flaw in this order is that 3 ..e6 4.Nc3 can (and should!) be met by 4 . . . Bb4! S.Qb3 Qe7 with a difficult, more or less equal, game in store . .
4.Nc3 c6
All right, now Black's saying that he will play a rare Hort Antoshin Variation (this line would arise after 5.g3 Qc7). Does he know what he's doing or is he as confused as White is at this nnint?
T E S T S O L U T I O N S I 3 9 9
5.e3
White avoids main line theory (a wise decision if you don't know the lines!) and decides to develop his pieces in an intelligent and logical fashion. 5 . .. g6 Black decides to go back into Leningrad-type positions. He intends to fianchetto his dark-squared Bishop and then strive for an . . . e7-e5 advance with subsequent play on the kingside where he owns more space, or in the center.
6.Bd3
Now the plans for both sides are becoming clear! I've already mentioned that Black intends to play for . . .e7-e5. White will strive to get play in the center with e3-e4. If he achieves this, the open e file will give him good chances to take advantage of the hole on e6 and the backward pawn on e7. 6 ... Bg7

It's always a good idea to get your King safe before you open up the center.

White begins to prepare for his dream advance to e4. This is a logical idea, but the immediate 8.e4 also deserved serious consid eration (why dream of ice-cream when you can buy some and stuff it in your mouth right away!?). 8 .. . Qc7 Black prepares for his own advance (i.e., . . . e7-e5). However, another idea is 8 . . . dS!?, trying to make White's last move look silly. If White had played e4 on this eighth move, Black wouldn't have had this possibility. The moral here is: Don't endlessly prepare to actualize a plan when you can just do it and get the ballrolling!

White missed this move because he became overwhelmed by Black's apparent threat of . . . e5-e4. If you focus too hard on what your opponent is going to do to you, it is easy to exclude your own possibilities out of panic and blindness.

Realizing that things haven't turned out as he originally planned, White calms down and comes up with an excellent plan. His intention is to follow up with 13.cS (gaining queenside space) when Bc4+ or Nf3-d2-c4-d6 (making use of the hole on d6) may follow. By the way, I would probably have preferred the immediate

At first, this move really disturbed me for three reasons: 1) it wastes time by making a kingside pawn move (don't play in your opponent's area!); 2) this pawn move lets Black rip open kingside lin�s by a later . . .g6-g5-g4; 3) I'm not really sure if this move is necessary (if the f3-Knight intends to go to d6 via Nf3-d2-c4-d6, then it's clearly unnecessary). A second look shows me that White did have some valid ideas when playing 18.h3. First, he has a space edge and wants to take a square away from the enemy pieces. Second, he has decided to keep his Knight on f3 so that it can place pressure on the eS-pawn. His 18th move allows the Knight to stay in place by stopping . . . Eg4. Does this mean that I like White's move now? No, it still makes me uncomfortable. However, the fact that he had valid ideas to back up his choice goes a long way towards atonement.

Black shows that he's mentally beaten. Instead of trying a hopeless defense (he has no chance of survival on the queenside), the second player should have gone all out on the kingside with 18 . . . gS. This would have terrified White and gone a long way towards challenging the wisdom of 18.h3 (after 18 . . . gS, White could try the very interesting 19.NdS!? when 19 . . . cxdS 20.exdS+ Kh8?? 21.NxeS is devastating. However, 20 . . . e4 allows Black to keep fighting).
19.Bb2 Nfe8

Whenever you are going to make a trade, always ask if your pieces are better than his. If they are, only go through with the exchange if you are making some other kind of inajor gain. In this case White had several winning continua tions, and his willingness to chop off the Rooks demonstrates a fla�ed mental direction that will eventually lead to his downfall. Best would have been 27.Qd2! when 27 . . .Rxd6?? 28.cxd6 pie.ks up a piece. Unfortunately for Black, any move of the d8- Rook (27 . . . Rde8, for example) allows 28.Rd7, while 27 . . . Bf6 gets totally wasted by 28.B:xeS!. So this (27.RxdB??) is the point where White begins to throw the game away. Why? How did this happen after his fine play during the last several moves? I really don't have any answer because Mr. Andersson was also confused about his motivation and what he was trying to achieve. Some possibilities are: 1) He was getting tired (poor judgment is common at the end of along, exhausting game); 2) He was getting impatient (he knew he was winning and wanted to get rewarded for his good play as auicklv as possible);

3) He suffered a blind spot and thought that Black could trade on d6, not noticing that this would lose to the pawn recapture and the fork that comes with it; 4) He lost his sense of danger and thought that "any thing would win" (you always have to concentrate fully until the opponent resigns); 5) He got carried away on the wings of his two Bish ops. This means that he felt his two Bishops would grant him a winning endgame so he played directly for that situation; 6) He might have felt that he was winnin g the eS-pawn and then had misgivings after the exchanges took place. 27 .. .

White is still much better but now he loses his mind by thinking that Bishops are always better than Knights in an endgame.

White has several tempting choices here. What would you do and why would you do it? Def'Ihis position was artived at by 1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 d6 (the Philidor ense) 3.Nc3 Be6?! 3 . . . Nf6 is better. 4.d4 Nd7 S o l 1&1t i o n 'Io understand this position, we have to break it down in a detailed manner: Fawn tension: Many of my students have a habit of trading paw�s as soon as they come into contact with each other. They have trouble realizing that destroying the pawn tension consider ably limits their own possibilities. In the present situ:ation White would usually refrain from capt.iring on eS for the following reasons: )lo- Ttohere is no hurry! White is the one with the option take since a black capture via ...exd4 would only help White bring his Knight to a better post after Nxd4. )lo- By not rushing to take on e5 White keeps Black off balance by making him worry about both dxe5 and d4-d5. )lo- Many players think that by taking on e5 they are trading their good d-pawn for Black's good e-pawn. However, this is not really the case! The real trade is d4-pawn for Black's inferior d6-pawn. )lo- Taking on e5 helps Black by freeing his entombed ts-Bishop. Why do something nice for your oppo nent? :Bishop versus Knight: At the moment both sides have two Bish<>ps and two Knights. However, White can try to hunt Black's e6-B ishop down by NgS or d4-d5. Closed center: White must decide whether to close the center by d4-d5, to leave it as it is and just develop a piece, or to open the center comple1ely with dxeS.
T E S T S O L U T I O N S I 4 0 9
Creating a scenario where your imbalance is superior to your opponent's: This is the key to the position! White should take all the information given earlier and mix it together in some palatable form. Here's the way I would approach this position: I already have a small advantage in space, so quiet development by Be2 and O-O is an option (in other words, I can simply nurture the imbalance that I already have). I can also play h2-h3 (a useful move in itself) with the threat of d4-d5, winning Black's Bishop. More interesting, however, is a plan based on gaining the two Bishops. I could try and hunt Black's Bishop down by d4-d5, but why close the position if I intend to get Bishops? Wouldn't it be more logical to open the position? With this in mind, the immediate 5.Ng5 comes into consider ation (yes, I'm breaking the rule that tells us not to move the same piece twice in the opening!). Another way to do this is 5.dxeS (didn't I just criticize this move? No, I just pointed out all the things that were wrong with it and said that I normally wouldn't take it into serious consideration. In this case, though, White intends to grab the two Bishops, so opening the position as wide as possible makes a good deal of sense.) 5 . . . dxeS 6.Ng5 when 6 . . . Qf6 7.Nxe6 QxeS 8.Qd5! Oess clear is 8.NdS O-O-O 9.Bc4 Qg6 10.Qf3 NcS) 8 . . . Qxd5 9.Nxd5 O-O-O 10.Bc4 when White has the preferable position thanks to his two Bishops. White would be doing well if he chose 5.h3, 5.Be2, 5.Ng5 or
5.dxe5 followed by 6.Ng5. Just remember one big thing: don't
grab an imbalance if you feel the resulting position (and all the factors that make it up) is at odds with it (e.g., striving for Bishops in a closed position; striving for Knights in an open position. Both these errant plans might prove harmful to your health.).

Every student of the game should train himself to salivate rhenc:ver a hole appears on the board (of course, you should 'ave :m aversion towards creating them in your own position)! houEh. Black has absolutely no way to make use of that hole at 1e tn()ment, my eyes would go cloudy and I would fantasize in 1e foJlowing manner: I would dream of trading off my g6-Bishop nd e>1e Knight for White's two Knights. I would also dream of :xcha..1ging my bad dark-squared Bishop for White's good piece m c l . That would leave me with a good Knight versus White's 1ad Bishop. Then a quick maneuver like . . .

7. Qxf3 f6n
Wh.en I saw this move I almost collapsed in horror! One little 1awn push and so much self-destruction. Black has taken the f6- quarc: away from both his Knights, created a hole on e6, made his 3-BisJtop even worse than it was, blocked his Queen and thrown full 1empo out the window. Waat should Black have done? The answer lies in two areas: ) the minor piece battle; 2) the dosed position and the use of the 1awn pointing theory. W.1en the center is closed you generally play in the direction our pawns point. Since you must attack with pawns in closed 1ositions (compared to piece attacks in open positions), you hould usually advance the pawn that is next to your most dvan:ed unit. In this case, Black will play for . . . f7-f5 (placing the 1awn next to his advanced e-pawn) while White would like to 1lay c2-c4-c5 (something that won't be easy for him to do). Tre other key factor in the position is the minor pieces. White las �o Bishops and Black would like to follow this rule: When •our opponent has two Bishops, trade one off (for a Bishop 1r a Knight) and leave him with only one. #22
T E S T S O L U T I O N S / 4 1 1
Another rule worth following asks you to trade off your poor pieces for your opponent's good ones. In this case, Black would love to exchange his bad f8-Bishop for White's fine cl-Bishop. This can be done by 7 . . . Be7 followed by 8 . . . BgS or by 7 . . . g6 followed by 8 . . . Bh6. Most logical is 7 . . . g6 since it prepares for an eventual . . . f7-f5 advance and also prepares to trade the Bishops. Black's actual move caters to none of these positional de mands and, therefore, is an abomination of the worst order. More of this game follows in problems #22 and #23.

The first centers around the move f2-f4 . .Jorm._ally White would not consider this because, after Black takes m f4,. the e4-pawn would be backward on an open file and the 6-sq'l.lare would serve as a home for Black's pieces. N<ite that the weakening of e6 allows White to dream about >lacing a Knight there. Unfortunately, White's Knight has no way o reach this oasis in the heart of Black's position. This changes Lfter Illack captures on f4 since suddenly the f4- and d4-squares Lre available to the White Knight and inaneuvers like Nc3-e2-d4- �6 are now "on." This shows us that f2-f4, seemingly a space-gaining idea on he ki ngside, actually is a well-disguised attempt to infiltrate to e6 vith th.e Knight. Rf1ite's second plan ls even better. He has the two Bishops .nd vrould like to activate the pathetic guy on fl. Since bad �isho )S belong outside the pawn chain, the move 8.h4! turns out o be very strong. Please understand that White is not trying to ttack::Black on the kingside. Instead, he is playing for two goals: ) the nullification of all Black's kingside play; 2) the activation of he fl -Bishop. To achieve . . . f6-f5, Black will have to play . . .g7-g6 at some >oint [this also allow Black to trade his bad Bishop with . . . Bh6). Iowever, after 8.h4 g6 , White has the annoying 9.hS. More nportantly, White's real intention is to follow up with 9.g3 and O.BhJ, when the Bishop has turned into a monster! 0 nee he has stopped Black on the kingside and assured limself of a highly favorable minor piece, White can then tum his ttent:ion back to the queenside where he can try to make use of lis spatial advantage in that area.

White had more than one tempting move here. The most wious is 2.Qb3 (hitting b4 with tempo), but after 2 . . . as 3.Nc4 b8 .Black's defenses are tight (though White would obviously ive a good position). White can also consider placing a Knight on b3 since it frees ,e d2-square for the other horse (which is really doing nothing 1 f3) and places immediate pressure on aS. White's actual move, 2.aS, does several things: 1) it takes the 5-square away from Black's pieces; 2) it stops the Black a-pawn om giving support to b4; 3) it fixes the a6-pawn as a target (the �st ta rgets are those that can't move); 4) it fixes the a6-pawn on light-colored square. Now White's Bishop is a very proud piece. The concept of fixing targets on attackable squares is very, �ry iruportant.

I was very pleased to see that White wasn't afraid to have his pawns doubled (it doesn't matter if the move is actually good or bad; the fact that he embraced the concept is a very encouraging sign).

Bishop back to c2. So the threat really should not play a part in Black's decision to push to c4. Instead, the gain of queenside space and the closing of the center should be the main points of interest. In the present position, Black closes the center with 12 . . . c4 and thus forces both sides to play on the wings: Black will play for . . . b 7-b5-b4, opening queenside files and creating attackable targets in that sector, while White will play for mate with f2-f4-fS. Since White's plan is more threatening than Black's, 12 . . . c4 shouJd be rejected (with a shudder of disgust!) because it takes away Black's chances for central counterplay!

In the game White played 15.Bg6. Is this a good move? If you don't like it, what do you think he should have played? S o l u t i o n In this position, White became obsessed with his control over the c2-h7 diagonal and the attacking chances that this brings. Seeing a hole open up on g6, he played 15.Bg6?

This move doesn't make much sense because the light squared Bishop is White's best piece-it kept Black worried about the d5-square.

Active An aggressive move, line of play, or position. When mentioned in lieu of a player's style, it denotes a preferen�e for sharp, tactical or vibrant types of play. Advantage Having a superiority in position based on a particular imbalance or series of imbalances. See Imbalance. Analysis The calculation of a series of moves in a given position. This can be done in actual tournament conditions (in which you are not allowed to touch the pieces) or in a calmer scenario in which the pieces can be moved about (such analysis is often written down for future study or reference). The purpose of analysis is to discover the best move or plan; there is no limit to its length. Annotation Written comments (prose, chess symbols or actual moves) about a position or game. Attack To make a threat or threats against a specific piece or area of the board. Backward Pawn A pawn that has fallen behind its comrades, and thus no longer can be supported or guarded by other pawns of its own persuasion. In the diagram, Black has backward pawns at d6 and f7. The pawns on h6 and b7 are not backward because they can safely advance.

Bind To have such a vise-like grip on a position that useful moves are difficult for the opponent to find. One often speaks of a crushing space advantage as a bind. The diagram shows an extreme example of a bind; Black is bound hand and foot and can undertake nothing positive at all. Bishop Pair To possess two Bishops versus the opponent's Bishop and Knight or two Knights. Two Bishops work extremely well together and are usually an advantage in open positions. Bishops ofOpposite Col.or A situation in which each player has only one Bishop, each being of a different color, and thus the Bishops can never come into contact. This is usually a good attacking imbalance for the rniddlegame, since one can't defend what the other attacks. However, these Bishops are known to be rather drawish in the endgame, due to the fact that the defender can place his pawns and King on the opposite color of the enemy Bishop, whereupon they are impervious to harm. From an attacking point of view, a general rule for Bishops of opposite colors is that they are at their best with other pieces to back them up. On their own, they are often impotent. Blockade Conceptualized and popu larized by Aron Nimzovich (1886- 1935), it refers to the tying down (immobilization) of an enemy pawn by placing a piece (in particular a Knight) directly in front of it. In the diagram, the Knight on d6 is blockading the pawn on d5. Blunder A horrible mistake that hangs material or makes enormous posi tional or tactical concessions . Book Published opening theory. A "book player" is one who relies on memorization of published analysis rather than on his own creative imagination. "Taking someone out of book," refers to sidestepping published analysis by playing a new or unorthodox move. This denies him the chance to make use of a good memory and forces him to find good moves on his own. Break The gaining of space (and thus more freedom of movement) by the advance of a pawn. In the diagram, White intends to open lines of attack on the queenside by the break c4-c5 (pre pared by b2-b4). Black will strive to attack White on the kingside by an . . . f7-f5 break. Breakthrough A means of penetrat ing the enemy position. This can be done by a pawn break or by a sacrifice involving pieces or pawns. In the diagram, both sides are attacking each other's King. At the moment White is safe, since . . . gxf3 can be safely answered by Bxf3. So White uses the time given him to effect a breakthrough on the queenside by l.bxcS dxcS 2.NxcS! bxcS. If Black does not capture the Knight, White willsimply retreat it to d3 and rip Black open by c4-c5, Qb2 and Black will be mated.

White to play. Brilliancy A game that contains a very deep strategic concept, a beautiful combination or an original plan. Calculation The working out of variations without moving the pieces physically. Though this book has taught you to talk or reason your way through a game, there are many positions that have a purely tactical nature. In such situations, the player's ability to calculate variations accurately takes on great importance. The way to train your cornbinative (calculative) vision is to study the games of attacking players like Alekhine, Tai, or Kasparov. Follow their opening moves and then cover up the rest of the game score. At this point you should endeavor to figure out all the imbalances, the plans, candidate moves, etc. When this is done, calculate each candidate move as deeply as you can, writing down ail this information as you go. All these things must be done without moving the pieces around. When you have done all that's possible (take as much time as you need, we are looking for accuracy; speed will follow with practice), look at the move played, make it on your board and keep repeating the process until the game is complete.

Center Usually considered to be the e4-, d4-, e5-, and d5-squares, though the territotywithin the c4-, c5-, f4-, and f5-parameters can also be thought of as central. Centralize The central placing of pieces and pawns so they both control the center and extend their influence over other areas of the board, A piece willusually reach maximum maneuverability and power when centrally placed. Checkmate See Ma�e. Classical A style of play (sometimes called a school) that is concerned with forming a full pawn center. The strategic concepts that go with it tend to be viewed as ultimate laws and thus are rather dogmatic. A Hclyapsseical opening is an opening based on these views. See rmodern. Closed Game A position locked by pawns. Such a position tends to lessen the strength of Bishops and other long-range pieces simply because the pawns get in their way. Knights, not being long-range pieces, can jump over other pieces and pawns and thus are very useful in such closed situations. A typical series of opening moves that leads to a closed position is l.d4 Nf6 2.c4 c5 3.d5 e5 4.Nc3 d6 5.e4, etc. Combinatwn A tactical move or series of moves based on the opponent's weakened King, hanging or undefended pieces or inadequately guarded pieces. Usually involving a sacrifice, it is_ a calculable series of moves leading to material or positional gains. It is important to note that a combination cannot exist if at least one of the above factors is not present. Though several players have attempted to create a clear defmi tion throughout the years, the following definition by Silman and Seirawan is the most accurate: A combination is a sacrifice, combined with a forced sequence of moves, that exploits specific peculiarities of the position in the hope of attaining a certain goal. Compensation An equivalent advantage in one imbalance that bal ances the opponent's advantage in another. For example: material versus development or space versus a superior minor piece or three pawns versus a Bishop. Connected Passed Pawns Two or more pawns of the same color on adjacent files. See Passed Pawn. Control To dominate or have the sole use of a file, a square or group of squares, an area of the board, etc. Having the initiative would also put one in "control ."

Counterplay When the defending side starts his own aggressive action, he is said to have or be initiating counterplay. However, there are varying degrees of counterplay-some equalizing the chances, some not being quite adequate and some leading to the capture of the initiative and subsequently an advantage. Cramp A disadvantage in space that leads to a lack of mobility. Critical Position That point in a position when the evaluation will clearly turn to one side's advantage or stabilize down to equality. In such a position the scales are delicately balanced and the slightest error can lead to disaster. Defense A move or plan designed to meet an enemy's attack or threats. It is also used in the names of various opening initiated from the Black side. For example: Petroff Defense, Caro-Kann Defense, etc. These Black systems are called defenses since White has the first move and thus Black is considered to be defending. The usual flow from Black's point of view would be: defense leading to equalization followed, only then, by the switch over to a counterattack. This is the classical approach. More modem openings are often designed to create immediate imbalances in an effort to seize the initiative as Black. Strange as it may seem, even these counterattacking openings are usually given the title of defenses: Nimzo-Indian Defense, Sicilian Defense, Grunfeld Defense, King's Indian Defense, etc. Development The process of moving one's pieces from their starting posts to new positions where their activity and mobility are en hanced. It must be remembered that one's pieces should be devel oped to squares where they work with the rest of their army towards a particular goal. If an individual piece is providing a useful service on its original square, then there may be no reason to move it. Doubl.ed Pawns Two pawns of the same color lined up on a file as the result of a capture. Such pawns are generally considered to be weak, though quite often their ability to control certain squares makes them very useful. The diagram shows doubled ,��'. � ,A pawns in a favorable light.

Also note how doubled pawns give their owner an extra file to use. Black's position in the diagram would be considerably improved if he could double his own pawns by placing the d6-pawn on e6. Dynamic The word "dynamic" symbolizes the aggressive potential in any given position or move. �l.o Rating A mathematical system, now used worldwide, devised by Professor Arpad Elo to rank chess players. �n Passant A French term that literally means "in passing." When a pawn advances two squares (something it can only do if it has not yet moved) and passes an enemy pawn on an adjacent file that has ad vanced to its fifth rank, it may be captured by that enemy pawn as if the advancing pawn had moved only one square. This optional cap ture may be made only on the first opportunity, else the right, in that instance, is permanently lost. In the diagram, if Black plays 1 . . . c7-c5, White, if he wishes, may capture the pawn as if it had moved to c6. Thus, 2 .dxc6. If after 1 . . .c7-c5 White declines to capture and instead plays 2.c4, then after 2 . . . e7-e5 White could no longer capture the c5-pawn. However, he could capture the e5-pawn by dxe6 if he so desired. In chess notation an En Passant capture is labeled by the letter e.p. 15n Prise A French term meaning "in take." It describes a piece or pawn that is unprotected and exposed to capture. Endgame When most of the pieces have been exchanged, usually leaving both sides with one to three pieces each (plus any amount of pawns), the game is said to have entered the final phase, known as the endgame. 1,quality A situation in which neither side has an advantage. l,xcbange To trade pieces of equal worth. See Potnt Count. Trading a piece for something of lesser value is called a Blunder or a Sacrifice. �xcbange, The A comparison of value between a Rook versus a Bishop or Knight. Thus, if you have won an enemy Rook for your Bishop, you have won the Exchange.

Fianchetto An Italian word meaning "on the flank." Though you will hear many different pronunciations, the correct is fee-an-ket-to. When a Bishop is developed on QN2 or KN2 (b2 or g2 for White and b7 or g7 for Black), it is called a fianchettoed Bishop. This term applies only to Bishops. FIDE An acronym for Federation Internationale des Echecs, the World Chess Federation. Fil.e A column of eight squares. An open file is a file that is not blocked by either side's pawns. Fish A derogatory term denoting a weak chess player. Flank The sides of the board-the kingside and queenside. Flank Openings are openings that deal with flank development. Typical starts for such systems are 1 .c4, l.Nf3, l.b3, 1 .g3, etc. Force All pieces and pawns are units of force. For example, if White has four attacking units on the kingside to Black's two, White is said to have an advantage in force in that sector of the board. Forced A move or series of moves that must be played if disaster is to be avoided. Two examples: 1) You face a forced move when your checked King only has one legal move to get out of check. 2) A Knight (or any other piece) is attacked and has only one safe square to go to. Moving it to that safe square is also considered to be forced, even though other moves could legally be played. Gambit A voluntary sacrifice of a pawn or a piece in the opening with the idea of gaining the initiative, a lead in development or some other compensating factor. GeneralPrincipl.es Basic rules of play designed to serve as guidelines for less advanced players. As one's experience grows, one learns that rules are meant to be broken. For example: the old rule of "always capture with a pawn towards the center," is widely followed, but a good 30% of the time it is correct to capture away from the center. Other rules (such as, avoid doubled pawns, castle as early as possible, develop Knights before Bishops, etc.) are also just as suspect. The simple fact is that every situation must be looked at with an open mind--dogma is not something to be nurtured in life or in chess. Ghosts Threats that exist only in your own mind. A fear of your opponent or a lack of confidence will often lead to the appearance of ghosts and the cropping up of blunders in your play.

Grandmaster The highest chess title (aside from World ChaQlpion) that one can achieve. Conferred by FIDE, it is awarded to players who meet established performance standards. Other titles (in order of importance) are International Master and FIDE Master. Once earned, these titles cannot be taken away. Grandmaster Draw This label, originally used to describe a quick, uninteresting draw between Grandmasters, is now employed co describe a fast draw between virtually any class of players. ffack A derogatory chess term meaning a state of chess ineptitude. ffanging An unprotected piece or pawn exposed to capture is said to be hanging. Hanging Pawns Two adjacent friendly pawns on their fourth rank, separated from other friendly pawns, and subject to frontal attack on one or two half-open files. Though often objects of attack, they also possess a certain dynamic potential. Thus, the battle rages around the question, "are they strong or weak?" The diagram shows a common hanging pawns situation. The hang ing pawns on c5 and dS give Black an edge in space, good control of the central squares and pressure down the half open b-file. However, they are also exposed to attack. .Mog See Pig . .Mold A defensive term meaning to "hang on. " "Such and such a move would have held out longer," means that the move would have offered tougher resistance, but would most likely have ultimately failed. "Such and such a move would hold," means that the mentioned move would have allowed a successful defense. lfole A square that cannot be defended by pawns. Such a square makes an excellent home for enemy pieces (especially Knights) . For example, the opening l . c4 c5 2.Nc3 Nc6 3.e4 is playable, but leaves a hole on d4 that, after 3 . . .g6 and 4 . . . Bg7, can easily be used by a Black piece. Eutcb A special room set aside for players in a tournament to analyze their games and play skittles. Such a room allows various kinds of
G LOSSARY I 435
activity to go on without disturbing the unfinished games in the tournament. Usually used by the non-masters (called Rabbits), the term hutch becomes easily understandable. See Rabbit and Skittles. Hypermodern A school of thought that insists that indirect control of the center is better than direct occupation. In particular, Reti and Nimzovich successfully propagated the idea of central control from the flanks. Unfortunately, they took their ideas to extremes-just as the classicists did. Today it is recognized that both schools of thought are partially correct, and a blending of the two is the only truly balanced method. Imbalance Any difference between the White and Black positions. Material advantage, superior pawn structure, superior minor piece, space, development, and the initiative are all typical imbalances. Initiative When your opponent is defending and you are attacking or putting pressure on him, it is said that you have the initiative. Innovation A new move in an established position or opening. Intuitive Usually a sign of experience, it enables a player to choose a move or plan by feel or common sense as opposed to detailed analysis. Isolated Pawn A pawn with no friendly pawns on either adjacent file: A common opening that allows an isolated pawn is 1 .e4 e6 2.d4 dS
93.. Nd2 c5 4.exd5 exd5 5.Ngf3 Nc6 6.BbS Bd6 7.dxcS BxcS 8.O-O Nge7
Nb3 Bd6 10 .Nbd4. The negatives of an isolated pawn are its inability to be guarded by a friendly pawn and the fact that the square directly in front of it usually makes a fine home for an enemy piece since no pawns can chase it away. On the positive side, it offers plenty of space and the use of two half-open or open files on either side of it, with the result that one's pieces usually become active. Kingside The half of the board originally occupied by the King, K Bishop, K-Knight and K-Rook. The kingside is on the right of the player with the White pieces and on the left of the player with the Black pieces. Liquidation A series of exchanges that are initiated to quell an enemy attack or to trade off to a drawn or won endgame. Luft Literally meaning "air. " In chess it describes a pawn move in front of one's King that prevents back rank mate possibilities. Major Pieces Also called heavy pieces. The term applies to Queens and Rooks. See Minor Pieces and Pawns.

Maneuver A series of quiet moves that aim to favorably reposition one's pieces. JNaster A player becomes a master when he reaches an Elo rating of 2200, though he will lose this title if his rating drops below that point. JNate Short for checkmate. It means that you are threatening to capture the enemy King and nothing your opponent can do will prevent its loss. When this happens, you have won the game. Material The pieces and pawns, excluding the King. A material advantage is obtained by winning a piece of greater value than the one you gave up. For example, giving up a pawn towin a Rook means that you have an advantage in material. Mating At.tack An attack on the King that is expected to lead to a checkmate. Middl.egame The phase of the game that sits between the opening and the endgame. Subtle plans and exciting attacks are generally seen in the confines of the middlegame. Grandmaster Tarrasch once said, "Between the opening and the endgame, the gods have placed the middlegame." Minor Pieces The Bishops and the Knights. Minority Attack A plan based on the use of two or more pawns (the minority) to act as battering rams against the opponent's three or more pawns (the majority) in order to create a weakness in the opposing camp. Here is the most common opening sequence by which a minority attack is reached: 1 .d4 d5 2.c4 e6 3.Nc3 Nf6 4.Bg5 Be? 5.cxd5 exd5
6.Nf3 O-O 7.e3 c6 8.Bd3 Nbd7 9.Qc2 ReB 10.O-O Nf8 1 1 .Bxf6 Bxf6 12.b4
Be7 13.b5 Bd6 14.b:xc6 bxc6. White has carried out his minority attack and has left Black with a weak pawn on c6 and a weak square on c5. After a further Rfc l , Rabl and Na4, White will have great pressure against Black's queenside. This plan is very important to understand, and situations for its use constantly arise. Mobility To have freedom of movement for one's pieces. Mysterious Rook Move A move with a Rook that seems to have no threat or purpose, but which actually discourages the opponent from a certain type of action (see Prophylaxis), or sets up a very deep, well concealed plan.

Occupation When a Rook or Queen controls a file or rank, that file or rank is said to be occupied. Occupation of a square occurs when a piece is safely placed upon it. Open A type of position (see open Game) or file (see Open File). This term also refers to a type of tournament in which any class of player can participate. Though a player often ends up with opponents who are much higher (or lower) rated than himself, the prizes are usually structured around classes and, for this reason, opens are attractive to players of every rating. The open tournament is extremely popular in the United States and is beginning to be seen more and more in Europe. Open File A column of eight squares that is free of pawns. It is on open files (and ranks) that Rooks come to their maximum potential. Open Game A type of position that is characterized by many open lines and few center pawns. A lead in development becomes very important in positions of this type. Opening The beginning phase of a game. This usually encompasses the first dozen moves but it can easily go much further. It is often written that the main opening objectives are: 1) develop your pieces in a quick and efficient manner; 2) occupy as much of the center as possible; 3) castle early (King safety). While I can say that these objectives are basically correct, the real purpose of the opening is to create an imbalance and develop your pieces in such a way that they all work together in making the imbalance a favorable attribute. Opposition In the endgame, a fight between Kings often occurs that ultimately determines which one is stronger. This face-off between the two monarchs is known as the opposition. Outflanking An endgame maneuver with Kings which makes forward progress on the board while: 1) Simultaneously preventing your opponent from taking direct opposition; or 2) Temporarily giving up the opposition for a higher goal. Overextended When a player tries to gain some advantages by starting a major advance or offensive, and then this offensive fails, he is often left with various weaknesses and nothing to compensate for them. His position is then said to be overextended.

OJerprotectwn A term coined by Nimzovich. I t refers to defending a strong point more times than appears necessary. The idea is that a certain pawn or square may be causing the Black (the opponent) considerable problems. By focusing so much energy on it, the Black player would be unwise to break that point because that would unleash the latent energy of the White pieces. In the diagram, White is overprotecting the e5-pawn. The reason for this is that the e5-pawn spearheads a kingside attack by White. Normally Black might wish to close lines there by . . . f7-f5, but nowWhite would answer this and . . . ti-f6 with exf6 when all of his pieces have increased their scope and have be come extremely active. Thus Black is unable to do anything that would allow White to remove the e5-pawn. As a consequence, his defensive resources are greatly reduced. Also see Prophylaxis. lassedPawn A pawn that has passed by all enemy pawns capable of capturing it. In the diagram, White has con nected passed pawns on g5 and h6. Black has a passed pawn on a7 and a protected passed pawn on e4. E!assive An inactive move that does nothing to fight for the initiative. A passive position is a position with out counterplay or active possibilities. • Patzer A derogatory term that denotes a hopelessly weak player. Pawn The least valuable unit of force in a chess game. Pawns are not considered to be pieces, they are simply called pawns. Fawn Center Pawns placed in the center. White pawns on f4, e4 and d4, for example, would constitute a large pawn center. A common opening that allows White to build such a center in the hope of attacking it later is l .e4 d6 2.d4 Nf6 3.Nc3 g6 4.f4, etc. Fawn Chain Two or more like-colored pawns linked diagonally. The weakest point of a pawn chain is the base because that is the one pawn in the chain that cannot be defended by another pawn. Pawn Island A group of connected friendly pawns. In the diagram, Black has three pawn islands to White's two. It is usually considered to be advantageous to have fewer pawn islands than the opponent. Pawn Structure The positioning of the whole pawn mass. Also referred to as the pawn skeleton. This posi tioning of the pawns is what usually dictates the types of plans available

in a given position due to open files, space, pawn weaknesses, etc. Pig A slang for Rook. "Pigs on the seventh" is a common term for Rooks doubled on the seventh rank. Also known as "Hogs on the seventh." Plan A short or long-range goal on which a player bases his moves. Point Count A system of figuring out the worth of the pieces by giving each of them a numerical value. King = priceless; Queen = 9 points; Rook = 5 points; Bishop = 3 points; Knight .. 3 points; pawn = 1 point. The flaw in the system is that it does not take into account other factors (such as position, tactics, etc.) that often drastically change the relative value of an individual piece. Poisoned Pawn Any pawn that, if captured, would lead to serious disadvantage is considered to be poisoned. Positional A move, a maneuver or a style of play that is based on an exploitation of small advantages. Post Mortem A Latin term borrowed from medicine that literally means, "after death." In chess it refers to the sessions that often take place after a tournament game has finished. Both players discuss the game and attempt to find the reason why someone lost-the "cause of death. " In particular, those with huge or delicate egos love post mortems because they can show that they saw much more than the opponent (who was undoubtedly lucky to gain the victory). For those of a more open nature, if you have played a stronger player than yourself, you can sit back, ask what you did wrong and hope that the mysteries of the universe will unfold. Premature A hasty move, maneuver or plan--to take action without sufficient preparation.

Prepared Variation A deeply researched opening variation that is often strengthened by new moves. It is a common practice to prepare certain lines and new moves for particular opponents, refusing to use it against anyone other than its intended victim . ..Problem Child A reference to a Queen's Bishop that is trapped behind its pawns. For example, the French Defense (1 .e4 e6 2.d4 dS) is an attractive opening. Its one flaw is the Queen's Bishop, which is blocked by its own pawns and unable to reach an active square . .Prophylactic Move See Prophylaxis . .Prophylaxis A strategy explored by Nimzovich. Taken from the Greek word prophylaktikos, meaning to guard or prevent beforehand, prophylaxis (or a prophylactic move) stops the opponent from taking action in a certain area for fear of some type of reprisal. Overprotec tion is a form of prophylaxis . .lromotion Also called Queening. When a pawn reaches the final rank it's usually turned into a Queen. However, the pawn can be promoted into a Bishop, Knight, or Rook (it cannot be turned into a King). When a pawn is turned into something other than a Queen, the pawn is said to have underpromoted. l:'rotected Passed Pawn A passed pawn that is protected by a friendly pawn. See Passed .Pawn. Queening See Promotion. Queenside That half of the board made up of the four ftles originally occupied by the Queen, Q-Bishop, Q-Knight and Q-Rook. The queenside stands to White's left and Black's right. Quiet Move A move that is neither a capture, a check, nor a direct attack. Rabbit A humorous (slightly insulting) term for a non-master. Rank A horizontal row of eight squares. The seventh rank in particular is the subject of much activity, especially when a Rook settles there. Control of the seventh rank is considered to be an important advantage. Rating See Elo Rating Refutation A move or series of moves that demonstrates a flaw in a game, move, variation, analysis, or plan.

Resigns Realizing the hopeless nature of a position and not wanting to insult the intelligence of the opponent, a player can surrender the game (resign) without having to wait for a checkmate. Resignation occurs in the vast majority of tournament games, while actual checkmates are quite rare. Risk A double-edged sword. A move, plan or opening variation that aims for advantage while canying the danger of a disadvantage. Romantic The romantic era (macho-era) of chess was a time when sacrificing and attacking was considered to be the only manly way to play. If a sacrifice was offered, it was a disgracefu,l show of cowardice to refuse; thus, many beautiful sacrificial games were recorded simply because proper defensive techniques were not understood. That was in the 1800's. Today, a player who is termed romantic is one who has a proclivity for bold attacks and sacrifices, often throwtng caution to the winds. Sacrifke The voluntary offer of material for the purpose of gaining a more favorable advantage than the material jnvestment. Unlike a combination, a sacrifice is not a cut-and-dried affair--there is usually an element of uncertainty associated with it. Though a combination always has one or more sacrifices, a sacrifice need not be associated with a combination. Semi-open Game A position with some closed and some open qualities. Typically, 1 .e4 e6, l .e4 c6 and l.e4 d6 lead to semi-open games. See Open Games and Closed Games. Sharp A bold, aggressive move or position. A sharp player is one who enjoys dynamic, explosive situations. Shot A strong move that the opponent didn't expect. Simplif.y An exchange of pieces to reach a won ending, to neutralize an enemy attack or simply to clarify a situation. Skittales Chess played in an offhand manner, often at a chess club or fter a tournament game. Sound An analytically correct move or plan. A safe, solid position. Space The territory controlled by each player. Thus, whoever controls the most territory has a spatial advantage. Speculative An unclear or risky move or plan.

Strategy The foundation of a player's moves. The way to achieve a particular plan. See Plan. Style The preference for certain types of positions and moves. It is typical to have one player who enjoys open, tactical positions while his opponent may cherish semi-closed structures of a positional nature. Thus, the first part of the battle will be to determine who gets the type of position in which he excels. Support Point A square that acts as a home for a piece (usually a Knight). A square can only be considered a support point if it cannot be attacked by an enemy pawn or if the enemy pawn advance (attacking the support point) would severely weaken the enemy position. Suindk A trick from an inferior position. Symmetry A situation ln which both armies are identically placed on their respective side:s of the board. For example, l .c4 c5 2 .Nc3 Nc6
3.g3 g6 4.Bg2 Bg7 5 Nf3 Nf6 6.O-O O-O 7.a3 a6 8.Rbl Rb8 9.b4 cxb4
10.axb4 b5 11 .cxbS axb5 is a well-known symmetrical position that
comes from the EngJish Opening. Tactics Traps, threats and schemes based on the calculation of variations (at times rather long-winded). A position with many combinative motifs present is considered tactical. Tempo The unit of time represented by one move. For example: 1 .e4 d5 2.exd5 Qxd5 3.Nc3 gains a tempo, as the Queen must move again if it is to avoid being captured. Territory See Space. TlJeory Known and practiced opening, middlegame and endgame variations and positions. Opening theory is also referred to as boo k. TlJreat A move or plan that, if allowed, would lead to the immediate depreciation of the enemy position. TErne Can be used in several contexts. One meaning is the amount of thinking time as measured by special clocks (see Time Control) It is also used in reference to the ability to stop a particular action by the opponent, i.e. , "Black does not have time to coordinate a successful defense against the corning attack." Thus time also measures devel opment (an advantaEe in time being a lead in development) and the rate at which an attack is pursued or defended.

Time Control The amount of time given to reach a certain number of moves. In international competition this is usually 40 moves in 21/2 hours (extra time is given after 40 moves have been played). If a player uses up his 2 1/2 hour allocation and he has not yet made 40 moves, he will lose the game by forfeit no matter what the position on the board is like. Time Pressure That period of the game when one or both players have used up most of their time and must make many moves with little deliberation. Naturally, this should be avoided since it often leads to mistakes or game-losing blunders. Transitions The changing of one phase of the game into another-the opening into the middlegame and the middlegame into the endgame. Transposition Reaching an identical position by a different sequence of moves. For example, the Dutch Defense (1 .d4 f5) can be reached by l.d4 e6 2.c4 fS or by 1 .c4 fS 2.d4 e6. Trap A hidden way to lure an opponent into making an error. A trap should only be laid if it is part of the overall strategic plan. This way, it does not matter if your opponent falls for it or not; you will still be improving your position. Uncl.ear An uncertain situation. Some players never use this assess ment, insisting that every position is either equal or favorable for one side or the other. It has even been said that "unclear" is a lazy way to avoid figuring out what's really going on in a position. Variation The first two to five moves of a game lead to the bare-bones structure of a particular opening. All divergences from that point on are known as variations. Variations also occur in analysis of middlegame and endgame positions. Weakness Any pawn or square that is difficult or impossible to defend. Wild Extremely unclear. A sharp situation or move with unfathomable complications. Zugzwang "Compulsion to move." A German term referring to a situation in which a player would like to do nothing (pass), since any move willdamage his game. Zwiscbenzug "In-between move." A German term for an often unex pected reply thrown into an expected sequence of moves.
