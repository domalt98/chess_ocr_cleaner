Preface

Chess Fundamentals was first published thirteen years ago. Since then there have appeared at different times a number of articles dealing with the so-called Hypermodern Theory. Those who have read the articles may well have thought that something new, of vital importance, had been discovered. The fact is that the Hypermodern Theory is merely the application, during the opening stages generally, of the same old principles through the medium of somewhat new tactics. There has been no change in the fundamentals. The change has been only a change of form, and not always for the best at that.

In chess the tactics may change but the strategic fundamental principles are always the same, so that Chess Fundamentals is as good now as it was thirteen years ago. It will be as good a hundred years from now; as long in fact as the laws and rules of the game remain what they are at present. The reader may therefore go over the contents of the book with the assurance that there is in it everything he needs, and that there is nothing to be added and nothing to be changed. Chess Fundamentals was the one standard work of it kind thirteen years ago and the author firmly believes that it is the one standard work of its kind now.

First Principles Endings, Middlegame and Openings

1. Simple Mates

The first thing a student should do, is to familiarize himself with the power of the pieces. This can best be done by learning how to accomplish quickly some of the simple mates.

In the ending of Rook and King against King, the principle is to drive the opposing King to the last line of any side of the board.

In this position it took eleven moves to mate, and, under any conditions, I believe it should be done in under twenty. While it may be monotonous, it is worth while for the beginner to practice such things, as it will teach him the proper handling of his pieces.

Example 3 /Capab/artczr, /?./ [Since the Black King is in the corner, White can play as follows,] l,Bd3 Kg7 2.Bg5 Kf7 3.Bf5 [Already the Black King is confined to a few squares. If the Black King, in the original position, had been in the center of the board, or away from the last row, White should have advanced his King, and then, with the aid of his Bishops, restricted the Black King's movements to as few squares as possible. | Kg7 4Kf2 | In this ending the Black King must not only be driven to the edge of the board, but be must also be forced into a comer, and, before a mate can be given, the While King must be brought to the sixth rank and, at the same time, in one of the last two files; in this case either h6, g6, 17, or f8; and as h6 and g6 are the nearest squares, it is to either of these squares that the King ou girt to go.] Kf7 5.Kg3 Kg7 6.Kh4 Kf7 7.Kh3 Kg7
8.Bg6 Kg8 9.Kh6 KfB [White must now mark time
and move one of the Bishops, so as to force the Black King to go back. | 10.Bh5 Kg8 ll.Be7 KhS | Now the White Bishop must Lake up a position from which it can give check next move along the White diagonal, when the Black King moves back to g8. |

7...K112 8.Qg2# ]
8.Qg4#

Now we come to two Bishops and King against King. Here it has taken fourteen moves to force the mate and, in any position, it should be done in under thirty.

In all endings of this kind, care must be taken not to drift into a stalemate.

In this particular ending one should remember that the King must not only be driven to the edge of the board, but also into a corner. In all such endings, however, it is immaterial whether the King is forced on to the last rank, or to an outside file, e.g. h4 or a5, e8 or d1.

We now come to Queen and King against King. As the Queen combines the power of the Rook and the Bishop, it is the easiest mate of all and should always be accomplished in under ten moves.

In this ending, as in the case of the Rook, the Black King must be forced to the edge of the board; only the Queen being so much more powerful than the Rook, the process is far easier and shorter. These are the three elementary endings and in all of these the principle is the same. In each case the cooperation of the King is needed. In order to force a mate without the aid of the King, at least two Rooks are required.

far back and it may be brought up within protection of the King.] 6.e4 Kd7 7.e5 [Now it would not do to play 7.KF7 because Black would play Kd6 and While would have to bring back his King to protect the pawn. Therefore he must continue. |

Any other move would lose, as will be shown later.

2. Pawn Promotion

The gain of a pawn is the smallest material advantage that can be obtained in a game; and it often is sufficient to win, even when the pawn is the only remaining unit, apart from the Kings. It is essential, speaking generally, that the King should be in front of his pawn, with at least one intervening square.

If the opposing King is directly in front of the pawn, then the game cannot be won. This can best be explained by the following examples.

The whole mode of procedure is very important and the student should become thoroughly conversant with its details; for it involves principles to be taken up later on, and because many a beginner has lost identical positions from lack of proper knowledge. At this stage of the book I cannot lay too much stress on its importance.

In this position White wins, as the King is in front of his pawn and there is one intervening square. The method to follow is to advance the King as far as is

Example 8 [Capablanca, J. R.J l.Ke4 [In this position White can*! win by 1X5 Black's best answer would be g6 draws. The student should work this out ] [He cannot win by l.g5 because g6 draws. lliis. because of the principle of the "opposition" which governs this ending as well as all the pawn endings al readys given, and which will be explained more fully later on.

4.KX7 f5 5.g7+ Kh7 6.g8Q+ Kh6 7.Qg6#
4 compatible with the safety of the pawn and never to advance the pawn until it is essential to its own safety.

This ending is like the previous one, and for the same reasons should be thoroughly understood before proceeding any further.

3. Pawn Endings

I shall now give a couple of simple endings of two pawns against one, or three against two, that the reader may see how they can be won. Fewer explanations will be given, as it is up to the student to work things out for himself. Furthermore, nobody can learn how to play well merely from the study of a book; it can only serve as a guide and the rest must be done by the teacher, if the student has one; if not, the student must realize by long and bitter experience the practical application of the many things explained in the book.

This ending, apparently so simple, should show the student the enormous difficulties to be surmounted, even when there are hardly any pieces left, when playing against an adversary who knows how to use the resources at his disposal, and it should show the student, also, the necessity of paying strict attention to these elementary things which form the basis of true mastership in Chess.

[diagram]
Example 10 [Capablanca, J. R.J
[diagram]
Example 9
J. R. ]
l.g4 [IL is generally advisable Lo advance the pawn that is free from opposition. | a5 [Black makes an advance on the oilier side, and now White considers whether or not he should stop the advance. In this case cither way wins, but generally the advance should be stopped when the opposing King is far away ] 2a4 Kf6 3.h4 Ke6 [If 3...Kg6 then the simple counting will show that White goes to the other side with his King, wins the pawn at a5, and then Queens his single pawn long before Black can do the same. |
4.g5 Kf7 5 Kf5 Kg7 6h5 Kf7
[If 6...116 7.g6 and then the two pawns defend themselves and White can go to the other side with his King, to win the other pawn. | 7Ke5 [Now it is time to go lo the other side with the King, win the Black pawn and Queen the single pawn Iliis is typical of all such endings and should be worked out by the student in this case and in similar cases which he can pul up. |
1.fS Ke7
[If 1...g6 2.1'6 and we have a similar ending to one of those shown previously ] [If 1...116 2.g5 ]
2.Ke5 Kf7 3,g5 Ke7
[If 3...g6 4.f6 J [and if 3...116 4.g6+ and in either ease we have a similar ending to one of those already shown. ]
4.h5 [And by following it up with g5-g6 we have the
same ending previously shown. If Black should play
4...g6 himself we have the following.] g6 5.hxg6
hxg6 6.f6+ [With the same result.] 5

In this ending White can win by advancing any of the three pawns on the first move, but it is convenient to follow the general rule, whenever there is no good reason against it, of advancing the pawn that has no pawn opposing it.

Having now seen the case when the pawn are all on one side of the board we shall now examine a case when there are pawns on both sides of the board.

In these cases the general rule is to act immediately on the side where you have the superior forces.

4. Some Winning Positions in the Middlegame

By the time the student has digested all that has been previously explained, he, no doubt, is anxious to get to the actual game and play with all the pieces. However, before considering the openings, we shall devote a little time to some combinations that often arise during the game, and which will give the reader some idea of the beauty of the game, once he becomes better acquainted with it.

It is Black's move, and thinking that White merely threatens to play 2.Qh6 and to mate on g7, Black plays
1...Re8 threatening mate by way of 2...Re1#. White
now uncovers his real and most effective threat.

The same type of combination may come as the result of a somewhat more complicated position.

White is a piece behind, and unless he can win it back quickly he will lose.

These two examples show the danger of advancing the g-pawn one square, after having castled on that side.

2.Nf6+ gxf6 3.Rg3+ Kh8 4.Bxf6#
7

This is another very interesting type of combination. Black has a Rook for a Knight and should therefore win, unless White is able to obtain some compensation immediately. White, in fact, mates in a few moves.

The same type of combination occurs in a more complicated form in this position.

A very frequent type of combination is shown in this position. Here White is the Exchange and a pawn behind, but he can win quickly.

8.NH7+ Ke7 9.Rel+ Kd8 10,Qxg8#
8

The same type of combination is seen here in a more complicated form.

This combination is rather long and has many variations, therefore a beginner will hardly be able to fathom it; but, knowing the type of combination, he might under similar circumstances undertake and carry out a brilliant attack which he would otherwise never think of. It will be seen that all the combinations shown have for a foundation the proper coordination of the pieces, which have all been brought to bear against a weak point.

5. Relative Value of the Pieces

Before going on to the general principles of the openings, it is advisable to give the student an idea of the proper relative value of the pieces. There is no complete and accurate table for all of them, and the only thing to do is to compare the pieces separately.

For all general theoretical purposes the Bishop and the Knight have to be considered as of the same value, though it is my opinion that the Bishop will prove the more valuable piece in most cases; and it is well known that two Bishops are almost always better than two Knights.

The Bishop will be stronger against pawns than the Knight, and in combination with pawns will also be stronger against the Rook than the Knight will be.

A Bishop and a Rook are also stronger than a Knight and a Rook, but a Queen and a Knight may be stronger than a Queen and a Bishop.

A Bishop will often be worth more than three pawns, but a Knight very seldom so, and may even not be worth so much.

A Rook will be worth a Knight and two pawns, or a Bishop and two pawns, but as said before, the Bishop will be a better piece against the Rook.

Two Rooks are slightly stronger than a Queen. They are slightly weaker than two Knights and a Bishop, and a little more so than two Bishops and a Knight. The power of the Knight decreases as the pieces are changed off. The power of the Rook, on the contrary, increases.

The King, a purer defensive piece throughout the middlegame, becomes an offensive piece once all the pieces are off the board, and sometimes even when there are one or two minor pieces left. The handling of the King becomes of paramount importance once the endgame stage is reached.

General Strategy of Opening Example 17 fCapablanca, J. KJ l.e4 e5 2.NI3 [This is both an attacking and a developing move. Black can now either reply with the identical move or play as follows.] Nc6 [This developing move at the same time defends the e- pawn.] 3,Nc3 Nf6 [These moves are of a purely developing nature ] 4.B65 [It is generally advisable not to bring this Bishop out until one Knight is out, preferably the King's Knight. rIhe Bishop could also have been played to c4, but it is advisable whenever possible to combine development and attack.] Bb4 [Black replies in the same manner, threatening a possible exchange of Bishop for Knight with ...ftxe4 to follow. | 5,O-O | An indirect way of preventing 5... Jbcc3, which more experience or study will show to be bad. At the same lime the Kook is brought into action in the center, a very important point ] O-O [Black follows the same line of reasoning.] 6,d3 d6 [These moves have a two-fold object, viz.: to protect the e-pawn and to open the diagonal for the development of the Queen's Bishop. | 7.Bg5 [A very powerfill move, which brings us to the middlegame stage, as there is already in view a combination to win quickly by ftd5. The threat makes il impossible for Black to continue the same course. Ibcrc is a long analysis showing that Black should lose if he also plays 7...j g4.] Bxc3 [He is now forced to play this capture, as experience has shown, thus bringing up to notice three things.]
6. General Strategy of the Opening

The main thing is to develop the pieces quickly. Get them into play as fast as you can.

From the outset two moves, 1.e4 or 1.d4, open up lines for the Queen and a Bishop. Therefore, theoretically one of these two moves must be the best, as no other first move accomplishes so much. Suppose we begin
1.e4:

This example brings to our notice three things.

First, the complete development of the opening has taken only seven moves. (This varies up to ten or twelve moves in some very exceptional cases. As a rule, eight should be enough.) Second, Black has been compelled to exchange a Bishop for a Knight, but as a compensation he has isolated White's a-pawn and doubled a pawn. (This, at such an early stage of the game, is rather an advantage for White, as the pawn is doubled towards the centre of the board.) Third, White by the exchange brings up a pawn to control the square d4, puts Black on the defensive, as experience will show, and thus keeps the initiative, an unquestionable advantage. The value of the initiative is explained in Chapter 4.

The stratetical principles expounded above are the same for all the openings, only their tactical application varies according to the circumstances.

Before proceeding further I wish to lay stress on the following point which the student should bear in mind.

Before development has been completed no piece should be moved more than once, unless it is essential in order to obtain either material advantage or to secure freedom of action.

The beginner would do well to remember this, as well as what has already been stated: viz., bring out the Knights before bringing out the Bishops.

7. Control of the Centre

The four squares, e4, e5, d4, and d5 are the centre squares, and control of these squares is called control of the centre. The control of the centre is of great importance. No violent attack can succeed without controlling at least two of these squares, and possibly three. Many a manoeuvre in the opening has for its sole object the control of the centre, which invariably ensures the initiative. It is well always to bear this in mind, since it will often be the reason of a series of moves which could not otherwise be properly understood. As this book progresses I shall dwell more fully on these different points. At present I shall devote some time to openings taken at random and explain the moves according to general principles. The student will in that way train his mind in the proper direction, and will thus have less trouble in finding a way out when confronted with a new and difficult situation.

Control of the Center Example 19 /Capab/anca, J. R./ I.e4 e5 2.Nf3 d6 3,d4 Bg4 | A bad move, which violates one of the principles set down, according to which at least one Knight should be developed before the Bishops are brought out, and also because it exchanges a Bishop for a Knight, which in the opening is generally bad. unless there is some compensation.]

The student should carefully study this example. It will show him that it is sometimes convenient to delay castling. I have given the moves as they come to mind without following any standard book on openings. Whether the moves given by me agree or not with the standard works, I do not know, but at the present stage of this book it is not convenient to enter into discussions of mere technicalities which the student will be able to understand when he has become more proficient.

These examples will show the practical application of the principles previously enunciated. The student is warned against playing pawns in preference to pieces at the beginning of the game, especially pawn to Rook's third, which are moves very commonly indulged in by beginners.

8. Traps

I shall now give a few positions or traps to be avoided in the openings, and in which (practice has shown) beginners are often caught.

There are a good many other traps - in fact, there is a book written on traps on the chess board; but the type given above is the most common of all. A Classical Ending Example 23 [Capablanca, J.

Endgame Principles

We shall now go back to the endings in search of a few more principles, then again to the middle game, and finally to the openings once more, so that the advance may not only be gradual but homogeneous. In this way the foundation on which we expect to build the structure will be firm and solid.

9. A Cardinal Principle

In the position shown above, White can draw by playing 1.b4 according to the general rule that governs such cases, i.e. to advance the pawn that is free from opposition. But suppose that White, either because he does not know this principle or because he does not, in this case, sufficiently appreciate the value of its application; suppose, we say, that he plays 1.a4. Then Black can win by playing 1...a5, applying one of the cardinal principles of the high strategy of chess:

A unit that holds two.

In this case one pawn would hold two of the opponent's pawns. The student cannot lay too much stress on this principle. It can be applied in many ways, and it constitutes one of the principal weapons in the hands of a master.

The example given should be sufficient proof. We have given a few moves of the main variation after
1.a4.

10. A Classical Ending

In this position White's best line of defence consists in keeping his pawn where it stands at h2. As soon as the pawn is advanced it becomes easier for Black to win. On the other hand, Black's plan to win (supposing that White does not advance his pawn) may be divided into three parts. The first part will be to get his King to h3, at the same time keeping intact the position of his pawns. (This is all important, since, in order to win the game, it is essential at the end that Black may able to advance his rearmost pawn one or two squares according to the position of the White King.)

It is in this analytical way that the student should try to learn. He will thus train his mind to follow a logical Obtaining a Passed Pawn Example 24b fCapa&Zaraa, J. 2?.J Obtaining a Passed Pawn Example 24a [Capablanca, J. /?./ l".b6 2,cxb6 cxb6 [It would not be advisable to try to obtain a passsed pawn because the White pawns would be nearer to Queen than the single Black pawn.]

The next subject we shall study is the simple opposition, but before we devote our time to it I wish to call attention to two things.

11. Obtaining a Passed Pawn

When three or more pawns are opposed to each other in some such position as the one in Example 24, there is always a chance for one side or the other of obtaining a passed pawn.

In this position the way of obtaining a passed pawn is to advance the centre pawn.

Now if it had been Black's move, see this example:

The Opposition Example 26 [Capablcmca, J. R.] Which Pawn Queens First? Example 25 [Capablanca, J. RJ l.Kd4 Kd6 [Here Black had the option of either opposing the passage of the White King by playing l ...Ad6 or, if he prefers, he can pass with his own King by La4 h5 2,a5 h4 3,b6 axb6 [Now comes a little replying 1...KI'5 ] calculation. White can capture the pawn, but it he does so, he will not, when Queening, command the square where Black will also Queen his pawn. Therefore, instead of taking, he pushes.] 4.a6 h3 5.a7 h2 6.a8Q [.And wins.]
12. How to find out Which Pawn will be First to
Queen

When two pawns are free, or will be free, to advance to Queen, you can find out, by counting, which pawn will be the first to succeed.

In this position whoever moves first wins. The first thing is to find out, by counting, whether the opposing King can be in time to stop the passed pawn from Queening. When, as in this case, it cannot be done, the point is to count which pawn comes in first. In this case the time is the same, but the pawn that reaches the last square first and becomes a Queen is in a position to capture the adversary's Queen when he makes one.

The student would do well to acquaint himself with various simple endings of this sort, so as to acquire the habit of counting, and thus be able to know with ease when he can or cannot get there first. Once again I must call attention to the fact that a book cannot by itself teach how to play. It can only serve as a guide, and the rest must be learned by experience, and if a teacher can be had at the same time, so much the faster will the student be able to learn.

13. The Opposition

When Kings have to be moved, and one player can, by force, bring his King into a position similar to the one shown in the following diagram (see Example 26 for more), so that his adversary is forced to move and make way for him, the player obtaining that advantage is said to have the opposition.

Notice that the Kings are directly opposed to each other, and the number of intervening squares between them is odd - one in this case.

The opposition can take the form show above, which can be called actual or close frontal opposition; or this form:

which can be called actual or close diagonal opposition. The Opposition Example 27 /CqpaWottca, J, /?.J
[diagram]
1.Ke2 Ke7
[The process is comparatively simple in the variation given above, but Black has other lines of defense more difficult to overcome. Let us begin anew with J...Kd8 Now if 2.Nd3 Nd7, or Bf2.Qe3 A'e7, and Black obtains the opposition in both cases, (When the Kings are directly in front on one another, and the number of intervening squares between the Kings is odd, the player who has moved last has the opposition.) Now in order to win, the White King must advance. Hiere is only one other square where he can go, f3. and that is the right place. Therefore it is seen that in such cases when the opponent makes a so-called wailing move, you must advance, leaving a rank or file free between the Kings. Therefore we have
2.Kt3 Kc7 Now. it would be bad to advance,
because then Black, by bringing up his King in front of your King, would obtain the opposition. It is White's turn to play a similar move to Black's first move, viz,: 3.Ke3 when brings the position back to the main variation shown. The student would do well to familiarize himself with the handling of the King in all examples of opposition. 11 often means the winning or losing of a game. ]
2.Ke3 Ke6 3.Ke4 Kf6 4,Kf4
[White can exercise the option of either playing
4.Kd5 and thus passing with his King, or of playing
the text move and prevent the Black King from passing, thereby keeping the opposition. Mere counting will show that the former course will only lead to a draw, therefore White takes the latter course. |
4...Kg0
[If 4...Ke6 5.Kg5 will win. ] 5*Ke5 Kg7 [Now by counting it will be seen that White wins by capturing Black's b-pawn.J Or again, this form:

which can be called actual or close lateral opposition.

In practice they are all one and the same. The Kings always on squares of the same colour, there is only one intervening square between the Kings, and the player who has moved last "has the opposition".

Now, if the student will take the trouble of moving each King backwards as in a game in the same frontal, diagonal or lateral line respectively shown in the diagrams, we shall have what may be called distant frontal, diagonal and lateral opposition respectively.

The matter of the opposition is highly important, and takes at times somewhat complicated forms, all of which can be solved mathematically; but, for the present, the student should only consider the most simple forms. (An examination of some of the examples of King and pawns endings already given will show several cases of close opposition.)

In all simple forms of opposition, when the Kings are on the same line and the number of intervening squares between them is even, the player who has the move has the opposition.

The above position shows to advantage the enormous value of the opposition. The position is very simple. Very little is left on the board, and the position, to a beginner, probably looks absolutely even. It is not the The Opposition Example 28 [Capablancat J. R.J LKhl! [The position of the pawns does not permit White to draw by means of the actual or close opposition, hence he takes the distant opposition; in effect, if I. Kfl (actual or close opposition) Kd2 2.Kf2 Kd3 and White cannot continue to keep the lateral opposition essential to his safety, because of his own pawn al 13.

| Ke3 7.Kg3 [White can come back to g3, as already shown, and always keep the opposition ] Two Knights vs Pawn Example 29 [Capablanca, J. R.J LNg6 h4 [White cannot take the pawn because the game will be drawn, as explained before.] 2.Ne5 h3
3.Nc6 h2 4.Nb5 hlQ 5.Nc7#
case, however. Whoever has the move wins. Notice that the Kings are directly in front of one another, and that the number of intervening squares is even.

Now as to the procedure to win such a position. The proper way to begin is to move straight up, as given in the example.

This position is an excellent proof of the value of the opposition as a means of defence. White is a pawn behind and apparently lost, yet he can manage to draw.

If the student will now take the trouble to go back to the examples of King and pawns which I have given in this book, he will realize that in all of them the matter of the opposition is of paramount importance; as, in fact, it is in nearly all endings of King and pawns, except in such cases where the pawn position in itself ensures the win.

14. The Relative Value of Knight and Bishop

Before turning our attention to this matter it is well to state now that two Knights alone cannot mate, but, under certain conditions of course, they can do so if the opponent has one or more pawns.

In the above position White cannot win, although the Black King is cornered, but in the following position, in which Black has a pawn, White wins with or without the move.

The reason for this peculiarity in chess is evident. White with the two Knights can only stalemate the King, unless Black has a pawn which can be moved.

[diagram]
Knight vs Two Pawns Example 31 [Capablanca, J. R.J
[diagram]
1...K112 2.Ng4i Khl 3.Kfl g5 4,Kf2 h2 5,Ne3 g4
6.Nfl g3 i 7,Nxg3#
Although he is a Bishop and a pawn ahead the following position cannot be won by White.

It is the greatest weakness of the Bishop, that when the h-pawn Queens on a square of opposite colour and the opposing King is in front of the pawn, the Bishop is absolutely worthless. All that Black has to do is to keep moving his King close to the corner square.

In the above position White with or without the move can win. We have taken the most difficult variation.

Now that we have seen these exceptional cases, we can analyse the different merits and the relative value of the Knight and the Bishop.

It is generally thought by amateurs that the Knight is the more valuable piece of the two, the chief reason being that, unlike the Bishop, the Knight can command both black and white squares. However, the fact is generally overlooked that the Knight, at any one time, has the choice of one colour only. It takes much longer to bring a Knight from one wing to the other. Also, as shown in the following example, a Bishop can stalemate a Knight; a compliment which the Knight is unable to return.

The weaker the player the more terrible the Knight is to him, but as a player increases in strength the value of the Bishop becomes more evident to him, and of course there is, or should be, a corresponding decrease in his estimation of the value of the Knight as compared to the Bishop. In this respect, as in many others, the masters of today are far ahead of the masters of former generations. While not so long ago some of the very best among them, like Pillsbury and Tchigorin, preferred Knights to Bishops, there is hardly a master of today who would not completely agree with the statements made above.

[diagram]
This is about the only case when the Knight is more valuable than the Bishop:

It is what is called a "block position", and all the pawns are on one side of the board. (If there were pawns on both sides of the board there would be no advantage in having a Knight.) In such a position Black has excellent chances of winning. Of course, there is an extra source of weakness for White in having his pawns on the same colour squares as his Bishop. This is a mistake often made by players. The proper way, generally, in an ending, is to have your pawns on the squares of opposite colour to that of your own Bishop. When you have your pawns on squares of the same colour the action of your own Bishop is limited by them, and consequently the value of the Bishop is diminished, since the value of a piece can often be measured by the number of squares it commands. While on this subject, I shall also call attention to the fact that it is generally preferable to keep your pawns on squares of the same colour as that of the opposing Bishop, particularly if they are passed pawns supported by the King. The principles might be stated thus:

When the opponent has a Bishop, keep your pawns on squares of the same colour as your opponent's Bishop.

Whenever you have a Bishop, whether the opponent has also one or not, keep your pawns on squares of the opposite colour to that of your own Bishop.

Naturally, there principles have sometimes to be modified to suit the exigencies of the position.

In the following position the pawns are on one side of the board, and there is no advantage in having either a Knight or a Bishop. The game should surely end in a draw.

Now let us add three pawns on each side to the above position, so that there are pawns on both sides of the board.

[diagram]

It is now preferable to have the Bishop, though the position, if properly played out, should end in a draw. The advantage of having the Bishop lies as much in its ability to command, at long range, both sides of the board from a central position as in its ability to move quickly from one side of the board to the other.

In the above position it is unquestionably an advantage to have the Bishop, because, although each player has the same number of pawns, they are not balanced on each side of the board. Thus, on the Kingside, White has three to two, while on the Queenside it is Black that has three to two. Still, with proper play, the game should end in a draw, though White has somewhat better chances.

Here is a position in which to have the Bishop is a decided advantage, since not only are there pawns on both sides of the board but there is a passed pawn (h- pawn for White, a-pawn for Black). Black should have extreme difficulty in drawing this position, if he can do it at all.

Again Black would have great difficulty in drawing this position.

The student should carefully consider these positions. I hope that the many examples will help him to understand, in their true value, the relative merits of the Knight and Bishop. As to the general method of procedure, a teacher, or practical experience, will be best. I might say generally, however, that the proper course is these endings, as in all similar endings, is: Advance of the King to the centre of the board or towards the passed pawns, or pawns that are susceptible of being attacked, and rapid advance of the passed pawn or pawns as far as is consistent with their safety.

To give a fixed line of play would be folly. Each ending is different, and requires different handling, according to what the adversary proposes to do.

15. How to Mate with a Knight and a Bishop

Now, before going back again to the middle game and the openings, let us see how to mate with Knight and Bishop, and, then, how to win with a Queen against a Rook.

With a Knight and a Bishop the mate can only be given in the corners of the same colour as the Bishop.

In this example we must mate either at a1 or h8. The ending can be divided into two parts. Part one consists in driving the Black King to the last line. We might begin, as is generally done in all such cases, by advancing the King to the centre of the board.

It will be seen that the ending is rather laborious. There are two outstanding features: the close following by the King, and the controlling of the squares of the opposite colour of the Bishop by the combined action of the Knight and King. The student will do well to exercise himself methodically in this ending, as it gives a very good idea of the actual power of the pieces, and it requires foresight in order to accomplish the mate within the fifty moves which are granted by the rules.

16. Queen against Rook

This is one of the most difficult endings without pawns. The resources of the defence are many, and when used skilfully only a very good player will prevail within the limit of fifty moves allowed by the rules. (The rules is that at any moment you may demand that your opponent mate you within fifty moves. However, every time a piece is exchanged or a pawn advanced the counting must begin afresh.)

This is one of the standard positions which Black can often bring about. Now, it is White's move. If it were Black's move it would be simple, as he would have to Queen against Rook Example 42

8.Qh5 | And we have the position of Example 40 with
Black to move,] move his Rook away from the King (find out why), and then the Rook would be comparatively easy to win. We deduce from the above that the main object is to force the Black Rook away from the defending King, and that, in order to compel Black to do so, we must bring about the position in the diagram with Black to move. Once we know what is required, the way to proceed becomes easier to find.

The procedure here is very similar. The things to bear in mind are that the Rook must be prevented from interposing at b8 because of an immediate mate, and in the same way the King must be prevented from going either a6 or c8.

We shall now examine a more difficult position.

Many players would be deceived by this position. The most likely looking move is not the best.

Note, in these examples, that the checks at long range along the diagonals have often been the key to all the winning manoeuvres. Also that the Queen and King are often kept on different lines. The student should carefully go over these positions and consider all the possibilities not given in the text.

He should once more go through everything already written before proceeding further with the book.

Planning a Win in Middlegame Play

I shall now give a few winning positions taken from my own games. I have selected those that I believe can be considered as types, i.e. positions that may easily occur again in a somewhat similar form. A knowledge of such positions is of great help; in fact, one cannot know too many. It often may help the player to find, with little effort, the right move, which he might not be able to find at all without such knowledge.

17. Attacking Without the Aid of Knights

It is Black's move, and as he is a Knight and pawn behind he must win quickly, if at all.

Black's last move was ...e4-e3, played with the object of stopping what he thought was White threat, viz.:
1.Ra5, to which he would have answered 1...Qf4+ and
drawn by perpetual check. White, however, has a more forceful move, and he mates in three moves.

White has a beautiful position, but still he had better gain some material, if he can, before Black consolidates his defensive position. Attacking with Knights Example 47 fCapab/anca, J. R.] Attacking with Knights Example 46 [Capab/anca. J.

6.Ne4 and Black should lose, ]
2.Nxe8

In these few examples the attacking is being done by Rooks and Bishops in combination with the Queen. There are no Knights to take part in the attack. We shall now give some examples in which the Knights play a prominent part as an attacking force.

18. Attacking with Knights as a Prominent Force

White is two pawns behind. He must therefore press on his attack.

The student should carefully examine the position, as the sacrifice of the Bishop in similar situations is typical, and the chance for it is of frequent occurrence in actual play.

19. Winning by Indirect Attack

We have so far given positions where the attacks were of a violent nature and directed against the King's position. Very often, however, in the middlegame attacks are made against a position or against pieces, or even pawns.

The winning of a pawn among good players of even strength often means the winning of the game.

Hence the study of such positions is of great importance. We give below two positions in which the attack aims at the gain of a mere pawn as a means of ultimately winning the game.

Black is a pawn behind, and there is no violent direct attack against White's King. Black's pieces, however, are very well placed and free to act, and by co- ordinating the action of all his pieces he is soon able not only to regain the pawn but to obtain the better game. The student should carefully this position and the subsequent moves. It is a very good example of proper co-ordination in the management of forces.

An examination of this position will show that Black's main weakness lies in the exposed position of his King, and in the fact that his Queen's Rook has not yet come into the game. Indeed, if it were Black's move, we might conclude that he would have the better game, on account of having three pawns to two on the Queenside, and his Bishop commanding the long diagonal. It is, however, White's move, and he has two courses to choose from. The obvious move, 1.Bc4, might be good enough (see note in example). But there is another move which completely upsets Black's position and wins a pawn, besides obtaining the better position.

These positions have been given with the idea of acquainting the student with different types of combinations. I hope they will also help to develop his imagination, a very necessary quality in a good player. The student should note, in all these middlegame positions, that once the opportunity is offered, all the pieces are thrown into action en masse when necessary; and that all the pieces smoothly co-ordinate their action with machine-like precision.

That, at least, is what the ideal middlegame play should be, if it is not so altogether in these examples. Direct Attacks en Masse Example 50 [Capablanca. J. RJ

General Theory

Before we revert to the technique of the openings it will be advisable to dwell a little on general theory, so that the openings in their relation to the rest of the game may be better understood.

20. The Initiative

As the pieces are set on the board both sides have the same position and the same amount of material. White, however, has the move, and the move is this case means "the initiative", and the initiative, other things being equal, is an advantage. Now this advantage must be kept as long as possible, and should only be given up if some other advantage, material or positional, is obtained in its place. White, according to the principles already laid down, develops his pieces as fast as possible, but in so doing he also tries to hinder his opponent's development, by applying pressure wherever possible. He tries first of all to control the center, and failing this to obtain some positional advantage that will make it possible for him to keep on harassing the enemy. He only relinquishes the initiative when he gets for it some material advantage under such favorable conditions as to make him feel assured that he will, in turn, be able to withstand his adversary's thrust; and finally, through his superiority of material, once more resume the initiative, which alone can give him the victory. This last assertion is self-evident, since, in order to win the game, the opposing King must be driven to a position where he is attacked without having any way to escape. Once the pieces have been properly developed the resulting positions may vary in character. It may be that a direct attack against the King is in order; or that it is a case of improving a position already advantageous; or, finally, that some material can be gained at the cost of relinquishing the initiative for a more or less prolonged period.

21. Direct Attacks en Masse

In the first case the attack must be carried on with sufficient force to guarantee its success. Under no consideration must a direct attack against the King be carried on a outrange unless there is absolute certainty in one's own mind that it will succeed, since failure in such cases means disaster.

A good example of a successful direct attack against the King is shown in the following diagram:

In this position White could simply play 1.Bc2 and still have the better position, but he prefers an immediate attack on the Kingside, with the certainty in his mind that the attack will lead to a win.

We give, from now on, games and notes, so that the student may familiarise himself with the many and varied considerations that constantly are borne in the mind by the Chess Master. We must take it for granted that the student has already reached a stage where, while not being able fully to understand every move, yet he can derive benefit from any discussion with regard to them.

Another example of this kind:

Direct Attacks en Masse Example 51
J. R.J
2LBh4 Qd7 22.Nxc8 Qxc6 23 Qd8+ QeS 24.Be7+ Kf7 25.Nd6+ Kg6 26.NB4+ Kh5 27.Nxe8 Rxd8
28.Nxg7+ Kh6 29,Ngf5+ Kh5 30,h3! ['Die climax
of the combination started with 21. 114. White is still threatening mate, and the best way to avoid it is lor Black to give back all the material he has gained and to remain three pawns behind ]

In this position the simple move 1.Nxe5 would win, but White looks for complications and their beauties. Such a course is highly risky until a wide experience of actual master play has developed a sufficient insight into all the possibilities of a position. This game won the brilliancy prize at St. Petersburg in 1914.

The student should note that in the examples given the attack is carried out with every available piece, and that often, as in some of the variations pointed out, it is the coming into action of the last available piece that finally overthrows the enemy. It demonstrates the principle already stated:

Direct and violent attacks against the King must be carried en masse, with full force, to ensure their success. The opposition must be overcome at all cost; the attack cannot be broken off, since in all such cases that means defeat.

22. The Force of the Threatened Attack

Failing an opportunity, in the second case, for direct attack, one must attempt to increase whatever weakness there may be in the opponent's position; or, if there is none, one or more must be created. It is always an advantage to threaten something, but such threats must be carried into effect only if something is to be gained immediately. For, holding the threat in hand, forces the opponent to provide against its execution and to keep material in readiness to meet it. Thus he may more easily overlook, or be able to parry, a thrust at another point. But once the threat is carried into effect, it exists no longer, and your opponent can devote his attention to his own schemes. One of the best and most successful manoeuvres in this type of game is to make a demonstration on one side, so as to draw the forces of your opponent to that side, then through the greater mobility of your pieces to shift your forces quickly to the other side and break through, before your opponent has had the time to bring over the necessary forces for the defence.

A good example of positional play is shown in the following game.

[Apparently the best way to meet the manifold threats ol White. 19...cxd5 would make matters worse, as the White Bishop would finally bear on the weak c-pawn via c4. J 2O.Rxe5 g6 21.Qh4 Kg7 22.QJ4 c5 [Forced, as White threatened 23.dxe6 and also 23.Rxa7.) 23,Qc3 [ 23...Qd6 was better. But Black wants to tempt While to play 24.dxc6. thinking that he will soon af ter regain his pawn w ith a safe position. Such, however, is not the case, as While quickly demonstrates. I must add that in any case Black's position is. in my opinion, untenable, since all his pieces are tied up for the defence of a pawn, while While's pieces arc free to act. ]

maneuver. All the Black pieces arc useless after this Bishop reaches d5.] Bxe6 26.Bf3 Kf7 27,Bd5 Qd6 [Nowr it is evident that all the Black pieces arc tied up, and it only remains for White to find the quickest way to force the issue.

E. Lasker said al the time that if White's play were properly analyzed it might be found that there was no way to improve it upon it. These apparently simple games are often of the most difficult nature. Perfection in such cases is much more difficult to obtain than in those positions calling for brilliant direct attack agains t the King, involving sacrifices of pieces.] 1-0

The object is to prevent the development of Black's Queen's Bishop via b7, after ...b7-b6, which is Black's usual development in this variation. Generally it is bad to move the same piece twice in an opening before the other pieces are out, and the violation of that principle is the only objection that can be made to this move, which otherwise has everything to recommend it.] Bd6 8*Qf3 | 8.Bg5 might be better.

9.c3 O-O 10.Bg5 Be7 [The fact that Black has now to

23. Relinquishing the Initiative

I have passed over the game lightly because of its difficult nature, and because we are at present concerned more with the opening and the middle-game than we are with the endings, which will be treated separately.

24. Cutting Off Pieces from the Scene of Action

Very often in a game a master only plays to cut off, so to speak, one of the pieces from the scene of actual conflict. Often a Bishop or a Knight is completely out of action. In such cases we might say that from that moment the game is won, because for all practical purposes there will be one more piece on one side than on the other. A very good illustration is furnished by the following game.

either case, as will be seen, ]
11...Qxf6 12.Bg3 Bg4 13.h3 Bxf3 14,Qxf3 Qxf3
15.gxf3 f6 [A simple examination will show that
White is minus a Bishop for all practical purposes. He can only free it by sacrificing one pawn, and possibly not even then. At least it would lose time besides the pawn. Black now devotes all his energy to the Queenside, and. having practically a Bishop more, the result cannot be in doubt. The rest of the game is given, so that the student may see how simple it is to win such a game.] 16.Kg2 a5 17.a4 Kf7 18.RK1 Ke6

It gives White a very solid game. Nimzowitch's idea is that White will in due time be able to play 12-f4, opening a line for his Rooks, which, in combination with the posting of a Knight on 15, should be sufficient to win. He thinks that should Black attempt to stop the Knight from going to f5, he will have to weaken his game in some other way. Whether this is true or not remains to be proved, but in my opinion the move is perfectly good. On the other hand, there is no question that Black can easily develop his pieces. But it must be considered that in this variation White docs not attempt to hinder Black's development, he simply attempts to build up a position which he considers impregnable and from which he can start an attack in due course. | dxc6 [The alternative 6...bxc6 gives White the best of the game, without doubt.

Then if possible, the placing the other Knight at cither h4. g3 or e3 as the occasion demands. The White King sometimes remains at gl, and other times it is placed at g2, but mostly at hl.

25. A Player's Motives Criticized in a Specimen Game

Now that a few of my games with my own notes have been given, I offer for close perusal and study a very fine game played by Sir George Thomas, one of England's foremost players, against Mr. F.F.L. Alexander, in the championship of the City of London Chess Club in the winter of 1919-1920. It has the interesting feature for the student that Sir George Thomas kindly wrote the notes to the game for me at my request, and with the understanding that I would make the comments on them that I considered appropriate. Sir George Thomas' notes are in quotation marks ("")and thus will be distinguished from my own comments.

to force Black to play ...b7-b5, which would weaken his Queenside pawns. Thus by playing 15.h3 White would have attained the desired object. The text move 1 5_d5 blocks the action of the White Bishop and facilitates Black's development. Hereafter While will act on the defensive, and the interest throughout the rest of the game will center mainly on Black's play and the manner in which he carries out the attack. |
15...Qc7 16.Bd3 [''This seems wrong, as it makes the
development of Black's Queen wing easier. He could not have played 16...b6. because of the reply 17.dxc6 followed by 18. d5."J b6 17.c4 Bb7 18.Rfcl [''With the idea of 19.Sabi and 20x5.

[Black's play hereabout is weak; it lacks force, and there seems to be no well-defined plan of attack. It is true that these are the most difficult positions to handle in a game. In such eases a player must conceive a plan on a large scale, which promises chances of success, and with it all, it must be a plan that can be carried out with the means at his disposal. From the look of the position it seems that Black's best chance would be to mass his forces for an attack against White's center, to be followed by a direct attack against the King. He should, therefore, play
20...Rac8 threatening 21...f5. If White is able to
defeat this plan, or rather to prevent it, then, once be has fixed some of the White pieces on the Ringside, he should quickly shift his attack to the Queenside, and open a line for his Rooks, which, once they enter in action, should produce an advantage on account of the great power of the two Bishops. ]

Endgame Strategy

We must revert once more to the endings. Their importance will have become evident to the student who has taken the trouble to study my game with Janowski (Example 53). After an uneventful opening - a Ruy Lopez - in one of its normal variations, my opponent suddenly made things interesting by offering the exchange; an offer which, or course, I accepted. Then followed a very hard, arduous struggle, in which I had to defend myself against a very dangerous attack made possible by the excellent manoeuvring of my adversary. Finally, there came the time when I could give back the material and change off most of the pieces, and come to an ending in which I clearly have the advantage. But yet the ending itself was not as simple as it at first appeared, and finally - perhaps through one weak move on my part - it became a very difficult matter to find a win.

Had I been a weak end-game player the game would probably have ended in a draw, and all my previous efforts would have been in vain. Unfortunately, that is very often the case among the large majority of players; they are weak in the endings; a failing from which masters of the first rank are at times not free.

Incidentally, I might call attention to the fact that all the world's champions of the last sixty years have been exceedingly strong in the endings: Morphy, Steinitz, and Dr. Lasker had no superiors in this department of the game while they held their titles.

26. The Sudden Attack from a Different Side

I have previously stated, when speaking about general theory, that at times the way to win consists in attacking first on one side, then, granted greater mobility of the pieces, to transfer the attack quickly from one side to the other, breaking through before your opponent has been able to bring up sufficient forces to withstand the attack. This principle of the middlegame can sometimes be applied in the endings in somewhat similar manner.

In the position below I, with the Black pieces, played as follows:

Another good example, in which is shown the advantage of the greater mobility of the pieces in an ending, is the following from a game Capablanca- Kupchik played at the Havana Masters Tournament,
1913. The full score and notes of the game can be
found in the book of the tournament.

White's only advantage in the above position is that he possesses the open file and has the move, which will secure him the initiative.

3.Rd4 Raa5
[Mistake number three and this time fatal. His best move was 3,..Rga5 After the text move there is no defense. Black's game is lost.

10.115#]
1-0 course is to bring the Rooks forward, so that at least one of them may be able to shift from one side of the board to the other, and thus keep Black's Rooks from moving freely. What this means in general theory has been stated already; it really means: keep harassing the enemy; force him to use his big pieces to defend pawns. If he has a weak point, try to make it weaker, or create another weakness somewhere else and his position will collapse sooner or later. If he has a weakness, and he can get rid of it, make sure that you create another weakness somewhere else.

This ending shows how easy it is to make weak moves, and how often, even in master play, mistakes are made and opportunities are lost. It shows that, so long as there is no great advantage of material, even with a good position, a player, no matter how strong, cannot afford to relax his attention even for one move.

27. The Danger of a Safe Position

A good proof of the previous statement is shown in the following ending between Marshall and Kupchik in one of their two games in the same Tournament (Havana, 1913).

It is evident that Marshall (White) is under great difficulties in the above position. Not only is he bound to lose a pawn, but his position is rather poor. The best he could hope for was a draw unless something altogether unexpected happened, as it did. No reason Endings with Rook + Pawns Example 59 [Capablanca, J. K.J [ l.Rc7i wins. ]
1...Rd6! [Now White has two continuations.] 2.f7
[Or 2,Rc7+ A) Now suppose that Black did not realize that 2... Qd4 was the only move to draw, and consequently played 2...Kb6 instead. Now the best continuation would be 3.17 Rg6+(Best.) 4.Kfl R1'6 5.Rc7 Kc5 Best. White threatened to check with the Rook at e6. 6. Kc2 Al) Rest. If 6...Kc4 both 7.h4 (and 7XeS will win; this last-named move particularly would win with ease. A2) 6...63 7.Rc3 b2 (Best) 8.Rb3 Rxf7
9.Rxb2 Rh7 10.Rd2 Rxh2 ll.Ke.3
This position we have arrived al is won by White, because there are two files between the opposing King and the Pawn from which the King is cut off by the Rook, and besides, the paw n can advance to the fourth rank before the opponent's Rook can begin to check on the file. This last condition is very important, because if the Black Rook were at h8, and Black had the move, he could draw by preventing the advance of the paw n, either through constant check or by playing ."SfX at the proper time. Now that we have explained the reasons why this position is won, we leave it to the student to work out the correct solution. ; B) 2...Kd4! 3.f7 Rg6n I (a very important move, as against 5...Rf6 4.Re7 wins. ) 4.Kfl Rf6 5.R67 Kc3 and White will finally have to sacrifice the Rook for the pawn, or draw by perpetual check. ]
2...Rd8!
[If there were nothing more in the ending it would not be of any great value, but there are other very can be given for Black's loss of the game except that he felt so certain of having the best of it with a pawn more and what he considered a safe position, that he became exceedingly careless and did not consider the danger that actually existed.

28. Endings with One Rook and Pawns

The reader has probably realized by this time that endings of two Rooks and pawns are very difficult, and that the same hold true for endings of one Rook and pawns. Endings of two Rooks and pawns are not very common in actual play; but endings of one Rook and pawns are about the most common sort of endings arising on the chess board. Yet though they do occur so often, few have mastered them thoroughly. They are often of a very difficult nature, and sometimes while apparently very simple they are in reality extremely intricate. Here is an example from a game between Marshall and Rosenthal in the Manhattan Chess Club Championship Tournament of 1909-1910.

In this position Marshall had a simple win by 1.Rc7+, but played 1.f6, and thereby gave Black a chance to draw. Luckily for Marshall, Black did not see the drawing move, played poorly, and lost. Had Black been up to the situation he would have drawn by playing 1...Rd6.

The fact that out of one apparently simple ending we have been able to work out several most unusual and difficult endings should be sufficient to impress upon the student's mind the necessity of becoming well acquainted with all kinds of endings, and especially with endings of Rook and pawns.

29. A Difficult Ending: Two Rooks and Pawns

Following our idea that the best way to learn endings as well as openings is to study the games of the masters, we give two more endings of two Rooks and pawns. These endings, as already stated, are not very common, and the author is fortunate in having himself played more of these endings than is generally the case. By carefully comparing and studying the endings already given (Examples 56 and 57) with the following, the student no doubt can obtain an idea of the proper method to be followed in such cases. The way of procedure is somewhat similar in all of them.

29.H4! g4
[Black is now in a very disagreeable position. If he played 29...gxh4 30. Rxh4 would leave him in a very awkward situation, as he could not go back with the King, nor could he do much with either Rook. He practically would have to play h6 when White would answer 31,b4 threatening to win a pawn by .32.b5. or, if that were not enough, he might play Qd4, to be followed finally by the entry of the King at c5 or e5. ]
30.Ke2 gxf3+
[Again he cannot play 30...h5 because 31T4 would leave him paralyzed. The advance of his h- pawn would make While's h-pawn sat e, and consequently his King's Rook would have to retire to f7 to defened the a-pawn. That would make it impossible for his King to go to d7, because of the a- pawn. nor could he advance a single one of his pawns. On the other hand. White would play b3-b4? threatening to win a pawn by b4-b5, or he might first play Nd4 and then at the proper time b_3-b4-b5, if there was nothing better. Black meanwhile could really do nothing but mark time with one of his Rooks. ]

Black's game has the disadvantage of his double c- pawn, which, to make matters worse, he cannot advance, because as soon as Black plays ...b7-b6, White replies b3-b4. It is on this fact that White builds his plans. He will stop Black's Queenside pawns from advancing, and will then bring his own King to e3. Then in due time he will play d3-d4, and finally e4-e5, or g2-g4-g5, thus forcing an exchange of pawns and obtaining in that way a clear passed pawn on the e-file. It will be seen that this plan was carried out during the course of the game, and that White obtained his winning advantage in that way. The play was based throughout on the chance of obtaining a passed pawn on the e-file, with which White expected to win.

The winning tactics in all these endings have merely consisted in keeping the opponent's Rooks tied to the defence of one or more pawns, leaving my own Rooks free for action. This is a general principle which can be equally applied to any part of the game. It means in general terms:

Keep freedom of manoeuvre while hampering your opponent.

There is one more thing of great importance, and that is that the winning side has always had a general strategical plan capable of being carried out with the means at his disposal, while often the losing side had no plan at all, but simply moved according to the needs of the moment.

30. Rook, Bishop and Pawns vs Rook, Knight and
Pawns

A final example of preserving freedom whilst imposing restraint. We shall now examine an ending of Rook, Bishop and pawns against Rook, Knight and pawns, where it will be seen that the Rook at times is used in the same way as in the endings already given.

From the first game of the Lasker - Marshall Championship Match in 1907. In this position it is Black's move. To a beginner the position may look like a draw, but the advanced player will realise immediately that there are great possibilities for Black to win, not only because he has the initiative, but because of White's undeveloped Queenside and the fact that a Bishop in such a position is better than a Knight (see Section 14). It will take some time for White to bring his Rook and Knight into the fray, and Black can utilize it to obtain an advantage. There are two courses open to him. The most evident, and the one that most players would take, is to advance the pawn ...c6-c5-c4 immediately in conjunction with the Bishop check at a6 and any other move that might be necessary with the Black Rook. The other, and more subtle, course was taken by Black. It consists in utilizing his Rook in the same way as shown in the previous endings, forcing White to defend something all the time, restricting the action of White's Knight and White's Rook, while at the same time keeping freedom of action for his own Rook and Bishop.

Further Openings and Middlegames

31. Some Salient Points about Pawns

Before going back to the discussion of openings and middlegame positions, it might be well to bear in mind a few facts concerning pawn positions which will no doubt help to understand certain moves, and sometimes even the object of certain variations in the openings, and of some manoeuvres in the middle games.

In the position of the diagram we have an exceedingly bad pawn formation on Black's side. Black's c-pawn is altogether backward, and White could by means of the open file concentrate his forces against that weak point. There is also the square c5, which is controlled by White, and from where a White piece once established could not be dislodged. In order to get rid of it, Black would have to exchange it, which is not always an easy matter, and often when possible not at all convenient. The same holds true with regard to Black's e-pawn, f-pawn and g-pawn, which create what is called a "hole" at f6. Such pawn formations invariably lead to disaster, and consequently must be avoided.

In this position we might say that the White centre pawns have the attacking position, while the Black centre pawns have the defensive position. Such a formation of pawns occurs in the French Defence. In such positions White most often attempts, by means of f2-f4 and f4-f5, to obtain a crushing attack against Black's King, which is generally castled on the Kingside. To prevent that, and also to assume the initiative or obtain material advantage, Black makes a counter-demonstration by ...c7-c5, followed by ...cxd4 (when White defends the pawn by c2-c3), and the concentrating of Black's pieces against the White pawn at d4. This in substance might be said to be a determined attack against White's centre in order to paralyze the direct attack of White against Black's King. It must be remembered that at the beginning of the book it was stated that control of the centre was an essential condition to a successful attack against the King.

In an abstract way we may say that two or more pawns are strongest when they are in the same rank next to one another. Thus the centre pawns are strongest in themselves, so to speak, when placed at e4 and d4 (or e5 and d5), hence the question of advancing either the one or the other to the fifth rank is one that must be most carefully considered. The advance of either pawn often determines the course the game will follow.

Another thing to be considered is the matter of one or more passed pawns when they are isolated either singly or in pairs. We might say that a passed pawn is either very weak or very strong, and that its weakness or strength, whichever happens to be in the case to be considered, increases as it advances, and is at the same time in direct relation to the number of pieces on the board. In this last respect it might be generally said that a passed pawn increases in strength as the number of pieces on the board diminishes.

In fact, they arc the moves of the Janowski-Lasker game in Paris, 1912. | 14.Qd3 g6
[diagram]
Having all this clear in mind we will now revert to the openings and middlegame. We will analyze games carefully from beginning to end according to general principles. I shall, whenever possible, use my own games, not because they will better illustrate the point, but because, knowing them thoroughly, I shall be able to explain them more authoritatively than the games of others.

32. Some Possible Developments from a Ruy Lopez

That some of the variations in the openings and the manoeuvres in the middlegame are often based on some of the elementary principles just expounded can be easily seen in the following case.

Let us suppose the game went on, and that in some way White, by playing one of the Knights to d4 at the proper time, forced the exchange of both Knights, and then afterwards both the Bishops were exchanged, and we arrived at some such position as shown in the following diagram. (I obtained such a position in a very similar way once at Lodz in Poland. I was playing the White pieces against a consulting team headed by Salwe.)

Now we would have here the case of the backward c- pawn, which will in no way be able to advance to c5. Such a position may be said to be theoretically lost, and in practice a first-class master will invariably win it from Black. (If I may be excused the reference, I will say that I won the game above referred to.)

After a few moves the position may be easily thus:

The Black pieces can be said to be fixed. If White plays 1.Qc3, Black must answer 1...Qd7, otherwise he will lose a pawn, and if White returns with the Queen to a3 Black will again have to return with 2...Qb7 or lose a pawn. Thus Black can only move according to White's lead, and under such conditions White can easily advance with his pawns to f4 and g4, until Black will be forced to stop f4-f5 by playing ...f7-f5, and we might finally have some such position as the following:

From a Ruy Lopez Example 66 [Capablanca. J. RJ [In this situation the game might go on as follows.] Lgxf5 gxf5 2.Qf3 Qd7 [White tlircatcncd to win a pawn by 3.Qxd5? and Black could not play 2...Rf8 because 3.Rxc6 would also win a pawn at least. ] 3,R5c2 Rg6 4.Rg2 Kh8 5.Rcgl Rcg8 6.Qh5 Rxg2
7.Rxg2 Rxg2 8.Kxg2 Qg7+ 9.Kh2 Qg6 10,Qxg6
hxg6 11.b4 [And White wins ] 1-0
[diagram]

Now suppose that in the position in the preceding diagram it were Black's move, and he played 1...Rf8. White would then simply defend his f-pawn by some move like 2.Qf3, threatening 3.Rxc6, and then he would bring his King up to g3, and when the time came, break through, as in the previous case. White might even be able to obtain the following position.

Black would now be forced to play 1...Rc8, and White could then play 2.Qc2, and follow it up with 3.Kf3, and thus force Black to play ...fxg4, which would give White a greater advantage.

A careful examination of all these position will reveal that, besides the advantage of freedom of manoeuvre on White's part, the power of the pawn at e5 is enormous, and that it is the commanding position of this pawn, and the fact that it is free to advance, once all the pieces are exchanged, that constitute the pivot of all White's manoeuvres.

I have purposely given positions without the moves which lead to them so that the student may become accustomed to build up in his own mind possible positions that may arise (out of any given situation). Thus he will learn to make strategical plans and be on his way to the master class. The student can derive enormous benefit by further practice of this kind.

33. The Influence of a "Hole"

The influence of a so-called "hole" in a game has already been illustrated in my game against Blanco (Example 52), where has been shown the influence exercised by the different pieces posted in the hole created at e5.

In order to further illustrate this point, I now give a game played in the Havana International Masters Tournament of 1913.

6.Bd3 dxc4 7.Bxc4 Nb6
[Of course the idea is to post a Knight al d57 but as it is the other Knight which will he posted there this maneuver does not seem logical. Ihe Knight at b6 does nothing except to prevent the development of his own Queen's Bishop. The normal course 7..,O-O followed by ...c7-c5, is more reasonable. For a beautiful illustration of how to play White in that variation, see the Janowski-Rubinstein game of the St. Petersburg Tournament of 1914. ]

[Had White's Bishop been at b3 he could now play
10.e4 as indicated in the previous note, a move
which he cannot make in the present position, because of Nf4 threatening, not only the g-pawti, but also ll...Qxd3+, As White's King's Bishop should never be exchanged in this opening without a very good reason White therefore cannot play 10.c4. |
10...0.0 11.O-O Bd7 12.Rcl
[ 12.Rcl White is perfectly developed, and now threatens to win a pawn as follows: - 13.Nxd5 Nxd5 14.e4 followed by 15.Rxc7. ]
12...c6
[The fact that Black is practically forced to make this move in order to avoid the loss of a pawn is sufficient reason in itself to condemn the whole system of development on Black's part. In effect, he plays . ,.Nd7, and now he has to shut off the action of his own Bishop, which thereby becomes little more than a pawn for a while. In fact, it is hard to see how this Bishop will ever be able to attack anything. Besides, it can be easily seen that White will soon post his two Knights at e5 and c5 respectively, and that Black will not be able to dislodge them without seriously weakening his game, if he can do it at all. From all these reasons it can be gathered that it would probably have been better for Black to play
12...Nxc3 and get rid of one of the tw o White
Knights before assuming such a defensive position. In such cases, the less the number of pieces on the board, the better chances there are to escape. ]
13.Ne4 f5 [This practically amounts to committing
suicide, since it creates a hole at e5 for White's Knight, from where it will be practically impossible to dislodge him. If Black intended to make such a move he should have done it before, when at least there would have been an object in preventing the White Knight from reaching c5.] 14.Nc5 Be8 15.Ne5 [The position of White's Knights, especially the one at c5, might be said to be ideal, and a single glance shows how they dominate the position. lhe question henceforth will be how is White going to derive the full benefit from such an advantageous situation. This we shall soon see.] Rb8 [There is no object in this move, unless it is to be followed by ...Qd7.

R.j l.d4 d5 2.c4 e6 3.Nc3 Nf6 4.Bg5 Be7 5.e3 Ne4 [I had played this defense twice before in the match with good results, and although I lost this game I still p layed it until the very last game, when I changed my tactics. The reason was my total lack of knowledge of the different variations in this opening, coupled with the fact that 1 knew that Dr. E, Lasker had been successful with it against Marshall himself in 1907. I thought that since Dr. I ,asker had played it so often, it should be good. Hie object is to exchange a couple of pieces and at the same time to bring about a position full of possibilities and with promising chances of success once the endgame stage is reached. On general principles it should be wrong, because the same Knight is moved three times in the opening, although it involves the exchange of two pieces. In reality the difficulty in this variation, as well as in nearly all the variations of the Queen's gambit, lies in the slow development of the Black Queen's Bishop. How ever, whether this variation can or cannot be safely played is a question still to be decided, and it is outside the scop e of tills book. I may add that al present my preference is for a different system of development, but it is not unlikely that I should some time come back to this variation.] 6.Bxe7 Qxe7 7*Bd3 [ 7,cxd5 is preferable for reasons that we shall soon see. ]

[ 6...N16 is the normal move in this variation. White's development was first introduced by Schlechter and elaborated later on by Rubinstein. It aims at the isolation of Black's d-pawn, against which the White pieces are gradually concentrated. In making the text move I was trying to avoid the beaten track.

Its good features are that it keeps the center int act without creating any particular weakness, and that it gives plenty of opportunity for deep and concealed maneuvering. The drawback is the long time it takes Black to develop his game. It is natural to suppose that White will employ that time to prepare a well- conceived attack, or that he will use the advantage of his development actually to prevent Black's complete development, or failing that, to obtain some definite material advantage.] 10.h3 Bh5 ll.dxe5 dxe5

for its object, as 1 said before, to take the initiative a way from White by disrupting White's Queenside.

My idea is that as there is no Black Bishop and because Black's pieces have been developed with a view to an attack on the Ringside, it will be impossible for Black to take advantage of the apparently unprotected position of White's King. Two possibilities must be considered. Firstly: If Black castles on the Queenside, as in this game, it is evident I hat there is no danger of an attack. Secondly: If Black castles on the Ringside, White begins the attack first, taking advantage of the awkward position of the Black Queen. In addition to the attacking probabilities of the text move. White in one move brings his King into safety and brings one of his Rooks into play. Thus he gains several moves, "tempi" as they are called, which will serve him to develop whatever plan he may wish to evolve.] O-O-O 13.Qe3 Rhg8 14.g3 Qa5 [Unquestionably a mistake, overlooking White's fine reply, but a careful examination will show that White already has the better position ] 15.Rd31 Kb8

Certain ly the Queen is far more valuable than the Knight, to say nothing of the time gained and the freedom of action obtained thereby for White's more important pieces.] Qg5 18.f4 Qg7 19.Bf3 [In such positions it is generally very advantageous to get rid of the Black Bishop controlling a6 and c6, which form "holes" for White's pieces.
