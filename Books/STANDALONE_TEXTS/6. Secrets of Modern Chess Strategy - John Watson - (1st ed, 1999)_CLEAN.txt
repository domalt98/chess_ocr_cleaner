Introduction In Chessman Comics #21, Chessman and Zug zwang are seen watching the chess western movie "Fort Blunder", starring General Princi ple and Chief Alternative, in which the follow ing dialogue takes place between the General and his assistant: "General Principle, sir, you've almost killed off them Old Indians !"; "Yup, but I fear there are new Indian formations coming!". At the time of Nimzowitsch, the world of chess was undergoing major transfor mations which would indeed challenge the gen eral principles then dominating chess theory. In fact, these changes, most apparent in the new Indian formations championed by Nimzo witsch himself, ultimately cast into doubt the very validity of having such things as 'general principles' at all. Nimzowitsch challenged older theory, .and his successors ushered in an era of pragmatism, rejection of dogmatism, and ana lytical research which still characterizes chess today. My task in this book has been to identify the most important changes in chess theory which distinguish modern from classical chess thought. Right away, since I am aware how daunting this book may seem to the reader, I want to make some organizational and philosophic points. First, defining what is 'modern' in chess has been a tricky task; as a general guideline, I have chosen 1935, the year of Nimzowitsch's death, as a dividing point between modern and pre-modern play. Of course, there was no revo lution in chess thought during that particular year; so ideas which I characterize as 'modern' were not necessarily unheard of before 1 935, and naturally, some of the concepts I will em phasize have only recently entered the general consciousness. But when the reader is confused as to why I am designating an idea as 'modern' or 'classical', he or she is advised to take this somewhat arbitrary dividing point as a guide. Unfortunately, the structure of this book is a bit tricky, and I hope the reader will forgive me if I make repeated explanations about it. Part 1 is designed to make the student feel comfort able with classical theory and with Nimzo witsch's revisions to that theory. It seemed only fair to the average chess fan to explain a bit about older theory and to lay some foundation for later claims of radical change. But Part 1 also opens the subject of the modern 'evolu tion' of the older theory. Although the distinc tion is a bit arbitrary, I have introduced in Part 1 what could be termed 'natural' developments of older theory, whereas Part 2 is devoted to 'revo lutionary' changes, for example, ones which re fute older principles or involve fundamental philosophical changes. Thus, both parts fulfil the mandate of the book's subtitle ( 'Advances Since Nimzowitsch'); but Part 2 covers, with a minimal review of past thought, the new ideas which radically distinguish modern play. Hopefully, the chapter and section introduc tions will help the reader to make sense of these distinctions. At the risk of becoming tedious, I will repeat and expand upon what I have just said about the organization of this book in the first chapter of Part 1 , and then again, to a lesser extent, in the first chapter of Part 2. Next, I want to discuss my stylistic approach to this book, including the use of statistics and my choice of exemplary material. The first point to make is that this is not an instructional book. While I would hope and assume that its study can only help one as a player, that is not its primary purpose. Nor am I writing a com plete guide to chess middlegame theory, in the way that well-known books written by Pach man or Euwe and Kramer have done. The book before you is a sort of middle game book, with numerous examples from opening theory, since the opening and middlegame are no longer The author referring to his own oeuvre!

8 SECRETS OF MODERN CHESS STRATEGY
functionally separable. Within that context, however, I am concerned with a large but lim ited set of topics I find relevant to my thesis of advances in modern chess. So, for example, if the reader looks for a section about "Open Files as a Factor in an Attack against the King" (Pachman), I may have said absolutely nothing about the subject. There is also little of a 'how to play' variety here. My goal has been to in vestigate theoretical issues, not, for example, how to handle time-pressure or prepare for the next tournament. The exciting reality is that there is enough material and food for thought to write a book twice this long without deviating from chess ideas themselves. From time to time throughout both Parts, I have referred to statistical analysis I have run on some issue (the frequency of appearance of a certain pawn structure, for example, or the win ning percentages of Black in the Sicilian De fence). In every case, this was done using the ChessBase database program. Although I have not always indicated the size or scope of the searches done, I have tried to make each search as unambiguous and statistically significant as possible. But interpretations of such data may certainly vary, and the reader might have fun doing his own research on such topics, espe cially since there are more subtle distinctions to be gleaned by so doing. For the first time, I think, certain ancient issues are subject to at least partial solution by using this type of anal ysis. As my ever-astute editor Graham Burgess points out, however, the use of such statistics leads to unavoidable ambiguities. Suppose, for example, that you examine a large set of end ings to decide whether queen and knight are su perior to queen and bishop. If players already feel that the queen and knight are superior, they may tend to convert superior positions into that presumably safest of advantageous endings. The resulting win-loss percentages will then be skewed in favour of the queen and knight, since they will reflect perception as well as reality. While I could do nothing about such effects, I did take care to examine not just statistics, but concrete examples whenever making a statisti cal claim. To cut a long story short, I feel that my tentative conclusions are largely correct in spite of this problem; and in the most contro versial cases (such as 'ir'+ltJ vs 'ii' +i.), any skewing would tend to favour the side I'm ar guing against (in this case, the side with queen-and-knight), and thus its correction would only strengthen my argument. If that last sentence is confusing, just keep in mind the drift of this discussion when you come across statistical arguments! The most difficult part of writing this book has involved the choice of what examples to use. At first, I wanted to avoid the re-use of the same classic examples which middlegame and instructional books have tended to beat into the ground. Experienced readers will know which ones I mean. On the other hand, it would be sheer arrogance to ignore what the many won derful writers on middlegame topics have said about the issues I am dealing with. Ultimately, I reviewed and took notes on a wide array of books, mostly theoretical works, instructional books, and games collections. Many of these are indicated in the bibliography. I used more examples from these than I had originally in tended, in part because of the wisdom imparted by their authors, but also because I discovered a number of new aspects to these examples (in cluding errors and mistaken assessments) which I felt clarified my arguments about the differences we see in modern chess. Then, as will be particularly evident in Part 2, I used da tabase searches to find fresh examples of games with modern ideas which range from routine to path-breaking. Since many of these modern examples might seem a little bizarre to the less experienced reader, their juxtaposition with well-known examples and with fairly nonde script exemplary positions will hopefully put one more at ease while exploring the new con cepts. Another general issue which I'm sure will' arouse comment concerns the relative chess understanding of classical and modern players. The reader should understand that my own early chess education was almost entirely filled by the study of the games of players be fore 1930; and the very first thing I did in pre paring for this book was to play over and critically examine hundreds of games by the old masters, as well as to read the classic texts and tournament books. Although I seldom ex plicitly address the subject, it will be obvious that I consider modern players to have a broader and more subtle understanding of the
INTRODUCTION 9
game than their predecessors. Normally, this would go without saying, and it in no way deni grates the great old masters, much as it hardly undercuts Bill Tilden' s achievements in tennis to state that Andre Agassi would dominate him in a match, or Newton' s work in physics to say that he failed to invent relativity theory. But there is so much emotion invested in the vener ation of the old champions that I want to em phasize my respect for their play, and also how irrelevant I consider the direct comparison be tween champions of vastly different eras. The point of the book is to show what has changed in modern chess, not to make negative judge ments about individual players. Finally, I need to remind the reader that there is no way of 'proving' the various claims I make about modern play. I can show examples, of course, but in the end, I will undoubtedly over or under-estimate the importance of various ideas. This book will be most meaningful if one keeps a careful eye out to assess whether the theories presented here have a solid empirical basis in one's own study and play. I hope that my book will at least influence you to do so, and to think freshly about modern chess. John Watson Carlsbad, CA; 1998 Part 1: The Refinement of Traditional Theory
1 Overview
The Nature of M iddlegame Theory Chess is traditionally divided into three phases: opening, middlegame, and endgame. Through out chess history, but especially in the last four decades, opening theory has expanded steadily. Of late, this expansion has become a sort of ex plosion, and we are inundated with almost un limited material on this phase of the game, from books to magazines to databases. Endgame the ory, while never an area of intense popular inter est, has always inspired a flow of high-quality books and articles, if only because the ending is so well-suited to definitive conclusions and strict analysis. But what of middlegame theory? Players wishing to study this area of the game have a limited and rather unsatisfactory range of re sources from which to choose. Rather than ad dress this phase of play in a theoretical sense, books tend to focus on more popular and tracta ble topics such as combinations, attack and de fence, how to improve one's thinking, and general advice for the competitor. In contrast to the opening and endgame, areas in which play ers normally turn to a contemporary work for enlightenment, many if not most students still read the classics when it comes to middlegame theory. How many of us learned our general middlegame principles from, say, Lasker and Nimzowitsch, or from the newer, but hardly contemporary, works of Euwe and Kramer, Romanovsky, or Pachman? In the United States, to this day, the most popular of these traditional sources is Nimzowitsch's My System, a book written in 1 925 ! However brilliant, readable, and ahead-of-its-time that book is (and it is all those things), one has to wonder that we don't have any number of more advanced and up dated works of its kind. Has the theory of the middle game gone nowhere in the last 68 years? Despite its appearance, that is not just a rhe torical question, and it requires a bit of thought to answer. On the one hand, this book will try to show that the state of modern chess theory is in deed dramatically different from the state of theory at the time ofNimzowitsch. On the other hand, it is extremely difficult to codify that dif ference in the way that chess theory has tradi tionally been presented, that is, with general rules, principles, or philosophic statements. We are all familiar with the kind of rules to which I am referring, ones which are purportedly useful if not strictly accurate, e.g., move each piece once in the opening, develop knights before bishops, pawns are strongest abreast, rooks be long behind passed pawns, don't put knights on the edge of the board, two bishops constitute an advantage, don't move pawns in front of your king, refrain from pawn-hunting when unde veloped, and so many others. Then there are 'principles' of positional play, which are often descriptions of the advantages or disadvantages of various elements of play, e.g., bad bishops, backward pawns, knight outposts, centralized pieces, doubled pawn complexes, pawn-chains, and countless other considerations to which we will return in the course of this book. I will now risk a statement that is at least in spirit, if not literally, true: This type of 'rule oriented' and 'principle-oriented' theory was worked out or at least substantially understood by the time of Nimzowitsch 's death in 1935. To put that a little differently, the rules and princi ples which could be clearly stated and still have
OVERVIEW 11
prospects of applying to practical play with general usefulness had already been enunciated and internalized by the world's best players by
1935. Let's assume that this proposition is true
for the moment. Wouldn' t it explain the lack of later works which posit a whole new set of prin ciples and rules, reflecting the discoveries of later generations? But here's where things get tricky. Anyone who reads a great deal of chess literature will be familiar with a related point of view, which goes something like this: 'Oh yes, all the fundamental principles were known by the great Old Masters. Modern chess consists of applying them to an increasing number of specific positions, along with a massive in crease in opening theory.' One might even add: of 'mere' opening theory, for many with this at titude make the familiar claim that if you sim ply gave, say, Lasker or Capablanca some time to 'catch up' with modern opening theory, they would immediately be challengers for the world title. I completely disagree with this point of view, and I don't believe it follows from my italicized statement above at all. Furthermore, it misses the point. While modern chess theory has ad vanced tremendously since the time of the early masters, it hasn' t advanced in a simplistic, rule-based fashion. In fact, to emphasize this, Part 2 of this book will begin its examination of modern chess with a whole chapter emphasiz ing its 'rule-independent' nature. But is modern chess therefore somehow less 'principled' than that of older times? There are several ways of answering this question. The first, least disturb ing, answer was expressed by Richard Reti in his magnificent classic Modem Ideas in Chess, when he was describing the modern style: "What is really a rule of chess? Surely not a rule arrived at with mathematical precision, but rather an attempt to formulate a method of win ning in a given position or of reaching an ulti mate object, and to apply that method to similar positions. As, however, no two positions are quite alike, the so-called rule, if applied to an apparently similar position, may possibly be wrong, or at least as regards that particular po sition, there may exist a more suitable or effec tual method of play. It is the aim of the modem school not to treat every position according to one general law, but according to the principle inherent in the position. An acquaintance with other positions and the rules applicable to the treatment thereof is of great use for the purpose of analysing and obtaining a grasp of the partic ular position under consideration ... the source of the greatest errors is to be found in those moves that are made merely according to rule and not based on the individual plan or thought of the player." [italics mine] This eloquent exposition contains the rela tively benign notion that in chess, general rules will never have universal application, and the rather more daring one that each position has a principle inherent in it. That insight is closely related to another fundamental tendency of modern chess: the increasing reliance on con crete analysis. That phrase ( 'concrete analy sis' ) has been a favourite of a whole series of leading players and theoreticians from what was often called 'The Soviet School of Chess' . Whether they formed such a 'school' or not can be argued, and of course, they claimed a variety of philosophic tenets. But the unifying claim which most clearly distinguishes the post-war generation of dominant players was the rejec tion of dogma and primacy of concrete analysis over abstract evaluation. Or, stated slightly dif ferently, the replacement of general rules by an emphasis on the characteristics and conse quences of the position at hand. In this respect, it is interesting to consider the recent books of super-trainer GM Mark Dvoretsky, which are making a huge impression on the European and American chess worlds. Among the many ideas and practical techniques he presents in his books, a powerful and consistent theme (and interestingly, the one singled out for praise by Kasparov) is the value of 'the analytic ap proach' , which assigns paramount value to ac tual analysis. It would be hard to think of a modern world-class player who does not take this approach. There is another way to answer the question 'Is modern chess less principled?' . A more rad ical response is to say that there are, indeed, a great number of new principles and even 'rules' implicit in modern play. But these principles and rules have not been explicitly stated; or in a very few cases, they have been stated, but not in a way that has infiltrated the conscious thinking of contemporary players. The reasons for this
12 SECRETS OF MODERN CHESS STRATEGY
lack of exposition are quite simple: the subtlety and complexity of such new principles would tend to require pages of painstakingly qualified prose for them to be adequately described, and it is both more natural and efficient for players to simply internalize this type of 'rule' during the over-the-board solution of hundreds of rele vant positions. In fact, it may be said of any chess rule that the concrete experience of an in dividual player gives him a more accurate and subtle understanding of its application than any conceivable verbal statement could. Regardless of which of these two appar ently opposing models we prefer, the days of easily expressible general guidelines are over. Thus, there is very little possibility that players or researchers will ever undertake to extend the project begun by Steinitz, Tarrasch, and Nim zowitsch, that is, the codification of chess prin ciples on a large scale. Ironically, although chess students are always warned to see the big picture rather than get lost in a morass of varia tions, the reality is that the modern player de rives his perspective and intuition from the detailed analysis of great numbers of positions. When you combine this fact with the growing irrelevance of so many of the classical rules, it is hardly surprising that writers are reluctant even to address the subject of modern princi ples, preferring to give examples of modern play which they deem typical. Methodology In light of the above, the very attempt to eluci date modern chess in general terms may seem old-fashioned and misguided. And yet, our modern literature of games collections, anno tated games, and magazine articles reveals a large pool of profound and revealing comments by strong players about new and subtle ways of thinking about the game. Even more power fully, their games themselves speak to us. It is still possible to discover general wisdom in the mass of modern practice; we simply have to re alize that the new ideas will be more qualified and specific than the bold and often discredited generalities of former times. Furthermore, there is a dynamic interconnectedness in chess which needs be taken into account; thus, modern guidelines will often have more to do with techniques, sequences and procedures than with static rules. To address such a complex subject, I have chosen to divide my discussion into two rather arbitrary parts. Part 1 of this book will review classical theory, and examine how certain tradi tional theoretical issues have been resolved or transformed in modern chess. The advances discussed will be in the broader sense 'evolu tionary'; we want to see what revisions and ex tensions of older theory can be described without scrapping old models or resorting to a new and potentially burdensome vocabulary. Part 2 tries to address the more 'revolutionary' ideas of the modern age. Many of these ideas involve the complete rejection of older rules, rather than their mere revision. Naturally, this distinction is rather arbitrary, and an overlap ping of topics is inevitable; just for example, the treatment of doubled and tripled pawns in Part 1, Chapter 4, could probably have fitted into Part 2 as well. While on the subject of how 'revolutionary' a chess idea is, it might be use ful to consider the historical role of Nimzo witsch's work. If one reviews the writings of Steinitz and Tarrasch, and games ranging from those of the nineteenth-century masters to Nimzowitsch's contemporaries, one can make the case that almost everything explicated and categorized in My System can be found in the previous literature and games. On top of that, Nimzowitsch's own games are often uncon vincing evidence for his own principles; one could argue (and it has been said) that Nimzo witsch more often won his games by superior calculation and even trickery than by applica tion of his principles. But the enormity of his achievement resides in something else entirely; it is in transforming the underlying, implicit principles of the chess played up to his time into an explicit, conscious part of modern chess-players' thought. Steinitz had done this with certain concepts such as the bishop-pair, pawn weaknesses, queenside majority, and other positional principles and techniques. Nimzowitsch either invented or brought into general use fundamental concepts such as the blockade, seventh rank, outposts, prophylaxis, the treatment of pawn-chains and doubled pawns, and many others. The fact that other chess-players had utilized such concepts in
OVERVIEW 13
their games (or for that matter, played various hypermodern openings) is hardly relevant, since they did so for the most part randomly and unsystematically. Likewise, just about any 'modern' chess idea expounded upon in this book can be found in some game or other prior to 1 935; but these ideas had not become the conscious (and every day) property of the world's leading players. To give a simple example (only because it is more easily stated in a few words than most of the ideas we will be dealing with), the sacrifice of the exchange obviously occurred well before the Soviet masters took a particular liking to it in the 1940s and 1950s; but it was neither a fre quent occurrence nor a part of the chess con sciousness of the times. Similarly, the notion of attacking pawn-chains at the front of the chain (and not at the base) certainly occurred prior to modern times; but it is now a conscious part of the chess-player's arsenal, and is employed in certain familiar and well-defined contexts. Other changes are more general, for example new ideas about time and development, dyna mism, modern prophylaxis, and such things. I would contend that such advances are mean ingful and real, despite the difficulty in describ ing them. Beginning with the next chapter, then, our task in Part 1 will be to present sketches of older theory and to show what has changed, while remaining in the context of the old for mulations. I will try to do this by following, to some extent, the order of exposition in Nimzo witsch's My System. Furthermore, I will try to consider what Nimzowitsch himself said about a particular area first, before addressing what others before and after him thought. This is pri marily a stylistic device, and due to the limited relevance of a number of topics in My System, it will be only a general guideline. It is important to remember that, since the subjects addressed are ones connected with particular new ideas in modern chess, this book is by no means com prehensive. The reader should not expect a primer or general work on positional chess; but rather, an exposition of certain topics which il lustrate the advances of modern theory. Without further ado, then, let's turn to the chess itself!
2 The Centre and Development
Any discussion of positional strategy must take into account issues of the centre. Consequently, this whole book will be concerned with con ceptions of the centre and its treatment. But w middlegame books like to emphasize certain el ementary aspects of the centre in isolation. One example is the occupation of the centre by pawns and the potential for a central pawn ad vance. Another is the value of quick develop- ment and centralized pieces. Let's first take a look at what Nimzowitsch said about these top- ics, and then relate that to some modern issues. The Centre a nd Tempi In My System, Nirnzowitsch begins with a chap ter called 'On the Centre and Development' . It is important to realize that the beginning of his book is to some extent an introduction to chess. It therefore includes a number of elementary 'rules' for the student, some of which Nimzo witsch himself did not adhere to. These rules, however, are reflective of the chess theory of his time, and thus of interest to us. In Part 2 of My System, Nimzowitsch's introductory chap ter ('The Conception of Position Play and the Problem of the Centre') revisits the issues of centre and development in a more sophisticated fashion. To begin with, Nimzowitsch addresses the traditional issue of using the centre to gain time. It is perhaps characteristic that this great hypermodern, with no special love of space or aggressive central pawn-masses, seems amus ingly uncomfortable with the classical virtues of the centre. In Chapter 1, he imparts a curious lesson, beginning with the moves 1 e4 e5 2 d4 exd4 3 c3 lDf6! 4 e5 lDe4 (D). The knight on e4, he says, "can maintain himself here, for 5 .Bd3 will be answered by 5 ...d5. Not, of course, a further wandering by 5 ...ltJc5?, for after this move, 6 cxd4 lDxd3+ 7 'ir'xd3 would yield an advantage of four tempi to White." This last variation is peculiar. Four tempi or not, 7 ...d5 ! leaves Black with two bishops and a healthy share of the centre (and it is White's 'good' bishop which has just been devoured). Most players would be quite content here as Black. (In fact, 5 'ir'e2! is usually recommended instead of 5 .Bd3, but that is just a detail). Nimzowitsch continues: "On the other hand, after 1 e4 e5 2 d4 exd4 3 c3 lDf6! 4 e5, it would not be advantageous to move the knight to d5, for the poor beast would not find any rest there: 4 ... lDd5? 5 'ir'xd4 c6 6 .Bc4 lDb6 7 lDf3 (D).
B
"White has six tempi as against two or one and a half, for the knight is not better placed at b6 than f6, and the move ...c6 is not really a whole tempo, since no move of a central pawn is here in question."
THE CENTRE AND DEVELOPMENT 15
This assessment is really egregious. Where have those valuable tempi gone after 7 ...4Jxc4 8 'ii' xc4 d5, again with the two bishops, and with Black about to catch up in the number of minor pieces developed? Indeed, in order not to be worse, White had better try 9 exd6 j.xd6 10 j.g5, when Black can equalize by either 10. ..i.e7 or 10. .. 'ii' c7 1 1 ir'e4+ j.e6 1 2 lDd4 O-O ! 13 lDxe6 l:te8, etc. This unfortunate start to one of the most bril liant chess books ever written dovetails nicely with one of the main themes of the current work. In chess, I will contend, our judgement is dulled by the use of artificial rules. Independ ence from such rules, moreover, is a crucial characteristic of modern chess thought. In the case before us, Nimzowitsch is caught counting tempi, utilizing the type of 'arithmetical' con ception of the game of which he himself was derisive. In fact, a highly qualitative view of de velopment, disregarding facile principles, per meates his actual play. In this context, the very next example in My System is noteworthy. It be gins witp a King's Gambit: 1 e4 e5 2 f4 exf4 3 lDf3 4Jf6 4 e5 (D).

Nimzowitsch explains: "here is an excep tional case where the square h5 is a satisfying one (as a rule, border squares are not favourable for knights), e.g., 4 ...4Jh5 5 d4 d5 (or 5 ... d6) ... , and Black does not stand badly." . What he says is quite true; but it is a funny example for someone trying to teach about the classical centre! Rather, we have the begin nings of a modern view of play. Above all, the typical modern master has a pragmatic view of things: instead of counting tempi or worrying about whether knights belong on the rim in the abstract, he concentrates on what works. This will be a theme throughout our investigation, and is particularly expanded upon in Part 2. Along the lines of 4 ...4Jh5, pragmatic knight moves to the edge of the board are abundant in modern chess, a rather amusing example being the current grandmasterly attention being given to the move 5 lDa4 ! ? after 1 d4 4Jf6 2 c4 g6 3 lDc3 d5 4 cxd5 lDxd5. That may seem a bit strange, but more reliable examples will be found in Part 2, Chapter 5 ('The Contemporary Knight'). How did Nimzowitsch view the relationship between pawn moves and development? Here are two of his pronouncements (still from the more elementary portion of his book): "In the open game, speed of development is the very first law. Every piece must be devel oped in one move. Every pawn move is to be re garded as loss of time, unless it helps to build or support the centre or attack the enemy's centre. Hence, as Lasker truly observes: in the open ing, one or two pawn moves, not more. " .. .it follows that moves of the flank pawns must be regarded as a loss of time - with this qualification, that in closed games the rule ap plies to only a limited extent, since contact with the enemy is not complete ..." The modern view of these matters is quite different, of course. Whether in closed, semi open, or open positions, flank pawn moves are regularly employed for a variety of reasons, e.g., the establishment of space, the discourage ment of castling by the opponent, or the launch ing of a minority attack. Pieces are moved any number of times, if necessary, to achieve strate gic goals. And the number of pawn moves in the opening can range from one to eight or more, depending upon the requirements of the position. Even in the traditional 'open games' (a des ignation for games beginning with 1 e4 e5), completing one's development can be super seded by a number of prophylactic pawn moves, as well as by pawn moves which are necessary to establish structural advantages. In the revi talized Scotch Game, for example, White seemingly neglects development in several lines, such as 1 e4 e5 2 4Jf3 lDc6 3 d4 exd4 4 lDxd4 lDf6 5 lDxc6 bxc6 6 e5 (to establish

For example, 10. . . i.g7 1 1 'fif2, and now Black's pieces are all developed, but his knight would be extremely cramped after 1 l ...tiJb6, whereas on l l ...tiJf6, White's struc ture allows him to catch up in development quickly by, among other lines, 12 i.e2 d6 13 i.f3 O-O 14 O-O i.b7 15 i.a3 tiJd7 16 tiJd2 and Black's problems are suddenly enormous. Re gardless of the further play, this line features six moves by pawns out of the first ten, at which point White's only developed piece was his queen ! Not surprisingly, openings which are more modern routinely defy Nimzowitsch's rules above. I can't think of anyone who would con sider the Najdorf Sicilian a 'closed game' (con sider the number of violent mating attacks by White which have occurred within the first 20 moves); and yet, Black can make a consider able number of further pawn moves with only one or two pieces out after 1 e4 c5 2 tiJf3 d6 3 d4 cxd4 4 ltJxd4 tiJf6 5 ltJc3 a6, for example, ... e5, ...h6 (to prevent i.g5 and thus guard d5), ... b5 (to prepare ... i.b7, prevent i.c4, and in some cases, advance by ... b4) might all follow shortly, making seven pawn moves before the development of the other pieces begins in earnest (and often, one of the first pieces moved is the queen, to c7, violating the often-stated principle that early queen moves are undesir able). Structure takes precedence over develop ment in a number of modern contexts. Turning to an example that illustrates a general con tempt for classical rules, a perfectly respectable Modem Defence line goes:
1 e4 g6 2 d4 d6 3 ltJc3 c6!? 4 f4 dS 5 eS hS 6
tiJf3 i.g4 7 i.e3 Of course, we're now in the area of closed openings. Notice that 7 h3 i.xf3 8 'flxf3 e6 9 i.d3 c5 would be the ideal counter-example to Lasker's 'one or two pawn moves' rule. Then Black would have made seven pawn moves, with every one of his pieces on its original square, and yet he would probably stand better! Why? Because White's d4 is untenable, and Black's pieces will all have good squares when they finally develop: knights on c6 and f5, queen on b6, etc. 7 i.e3 is more accurate, since it protects the centre and prepares O-O-O. 7 ... e6 By not playing ... i.g7 on move two or three, Black now has the bishop where it belongs, i.e., on f8 supporting ... c5.

With the collapse of White's pawn-chain, Black obtains a clear advantage. 20 .ltb5 gxf4 21 ltJd3 O-O-O 22 .ltxd7+ �xd7 23 lDxf4 rJ;e7 From a 1 992 game Manion-Norwood. _White simply has to stand by while Black plays ...l:thg8-g5, ....l:!.c8, ...b5, and at the appropriate moment, ... lDg3-e4, surrounding the e-pawn and creating too many threats. The lesson: there may be games in which one should make only two pawn moves and develop a new piece with every move, but there are so many 'exceptions' that to take such a guideline to heart would merely limit one's strength as a player. To wrap up this section, here's an amusing example to show how White can flaunt the rules as well: Kosten-Lucas, Tours 1996: 1 d4 lDf6 2 c4 d6 3 lDc3 e5 4 lDf3 e4 5 lbg5 i.f5 6 g3 !? h6 7 lDh3 c6 8 ltJf4 lDbd7 9 lDg2 !? d5 10 tt:Je3. At this point, White has moved his king's knight six times in the first ten moves, but as Kosten says, White appears to have a small advantage any way ! He has good pressure on the centre, and can play for .ltg2, O-O, and f3 with a positional edge. While this is admittedly on the extreme side, modern players increasingly discover po sitions in which structure takes precedence over development, especially when the mean ing of the latter term is limited by rules such as 'move each piece only once in the opening' . Pawn-Grabbing in the Opening About this topic, Nimzowitsch says: "What, therefore, the inexperienced player, young or old, must take to heart is the commandment: Never play to win a pawn while your develop ment is as yet unfinished!" He then goes on to give this exception: "A centre pawn should al ways be taken if this can be done without too great danger ... for thus you will get the possi bility of expansion at the very spot around which in the opening stages the fight usually sways, namely the centre." Once again, this advice is explicitly directed to the amateur. And yet, leading chess masters during Nimzowitsch's time (say, from 1910 to 1935) were disinclined to go hunting for pawns in the opening. Here, too, the modern view is distinctly more liberal. Centre pawns are still captured when possible, but flank pawn raids are also common from the outset of the game. Let's see if we can understand why. In the first place, the capture of a flank pawn often in volves more than the mere trade of material for time and development. Frequently, the disap pearance of a flank pawn undermines the gambiteer's interior defences, or it can allow a cramping spatial advantage for the grabber, since his pawns may advance on the same side of board with less resistance. This is best explained by examples. Begin ning with a very famous and complex one, let's consider the so-called 'Poisoned Pawn' line of the Sicilian Defence, Najdorf Variation: 1 e4 c5 2 lDf3 d6 3 d4 cxd4 4 lDxd4 tt:Jf6 5 lDc3 a6 6 .ltg5 e6 7 f4 'ii' b6 8 'ii' d2 'ii' xb2 9 .l:!.b1 'ii a3. This variation is so established that we forget how utterly bizarre and suicidal the idea of grabbing White's b-pawn once looked. Black has only the f6-knight developed, and even it is subject to attack by e5. What's more, the queen on a3 will surely lose even more time retreating from attack by the white pieces. Consider the now nearly-forgotten line 10 e5 dxe5 1 1 fxe5 lDfd7 12 .ltc4 (D). In the 1 950s and early 1960s, White won a series of brilliant miniatures from this position. After all, he has six very active pieces out ver sus Black's lone knight and queen, the latter of which is about to lose more time to .l:!.b3 or even to some lDb5 shot. Worse still, after O-O, taking over the open f-file, sacrifices on e6 and f7 ap pear too dangerous for Black to even contem plate allowing. All for one pawn, and for a cramped position in which mate can come from almost any direction (as the continuation

12 ... tDxe5? 1 3 lDxe6 ! , leading to a quick de nouement, shows). Referring to this Poisoned Pawn Variation (af ter 8 ...'ii' xb2), the brilliant, classically-oriented grandmaster Salo Flohr commented, even as late as 1 972: "In chess, there is an old rule: in the opening, one must make haste to develop the pieces, and must not move the same piece several times, particularly the queen. This an cient law holds good even for Bobby Fischer." Note that Flohr speaks of 'rules' and 'laws' , which are precisely the constructs the modern player increasingly rejects. This variation is a perfect example, especially in that the Poisoned Pawn Najdorf was a precursor of many similar endeavours by both Black and White, and sym bolic of a new attitude towards chess. Master players (most prominently Fischer, but also a number of innovative Soviet players before him) gradually adopted the attitude that these positions have nothing to do with rules or gen eral principles, and everything to do with con crete analysis. If Black can take the pawn and win points, they concluded, anything goes. In the case before us, much of what matters can be worked out at home, and I recall that Fischer, for example, was said to have taken only a few minutes to play this game as Black against Tringov in Havana 1 965 (from the diagram): 12 ... ..tb4 1 3 l:.b3 'ifa5 14 O-O O-O 15 tDxe6 fxe6 16 ..txe6+ �h8 171hf8+ ..txf8 18 'iff4 (D). Doesn't this game look like Alekhine versus Amateur, random simultaneous? And would any of the Old Masters after 1 900 allow such things as Black? And yet: 18 ... tDc6 ! 19 "ilf7 'ir'c5+ 20 �h1 lDf6! (and Black wins! ) 21 ..txc8 tDxe5 22 'ir'e6 lDeg4 0- 1 .

To this day, the Poisoned Pawn Variation is the main deterrent to White's 6 ..tg5 and 7 f4. When White does allow 7 . .. 'ii' b6, he tends to adopt more positional means (8 lDb3, avoiding the gambit, is often played, and if the gambit is offered by 8 'ir'd2, the move 10 f5 is usually chosen, with strategic aims taking precedence over immediate checkmating attempts). Kaspa rov, among others, continues to champion Black's position, and 6 ..tg5 has seriously de clined in popularity. Let's say that you wanted to justify this ex cursion (7 ... 'ir'b6 and 8 ... 'ir'xb2) theoretically. One might point to the first part of the explana tion I gave above, i.e., that White's interior de fence is compromised by the capture on b2, so he is obliged to defend c3, and loose pieces such as the bishop on c4 and knight on d4 are subject to pressure from key central dark squares such as c5 and e5. I should add that such pawn-grabs are not always a matter of homework; intuition and detailed over-the board analysis often suffice to convince the pawn-hunter to take a chance. But in general, the attempt to codify in words how and when one may go about such raids is doomed to fail ure. Analysis and practice decide. Let's look at some other examples of flank pawn raids: The following position arises from a Griinfeld Defence following the moves 1 d4 lDf6 2 c4 g6 3 lDc3 d5 4 cxd5 lDxd5 5 e4 lDxc3 6 bxc3 ..tg7 7 tlJf3 c5 8 l:.b1 O-O 9 ..te2 cxd4 10 cxd4 'ir'a5+ 11 ..td2 'ii' xa2 (D). It is another ex ample of an early queen excursion (with only one other piece developed) to grab a flank pawn. After about a dozen years of intense
THE CENTRE AND DEVELOPMENT 19
w practice and theoretical work, it is still one of the main lines of the entire Grtinfeld Defence. Black seems to be holding his own theoreti cally, but White is by no means backing down from the challenge (or fun?) of trying to punish his opponent' s impudence.
B
Here, again, Black has gone after the b2- pawn. This is from a Trompowsky Attack line which in itself contains some modern ideas of note: 1 d4llJf6 2 .i.g5 (bishops before knights!) 2 ... llJe4 3 .i.f4 c5 4 d5 'ifb6 5 tt:Jd2!? 'ii' xb2 6 llJxe4 'ii' b4+ 7 'ii' d2 'ifxe4 (again, Black has no pieces out and hasn't even moved a centre pawn ...) 8 e3. How to assess this position? White has space, superior development, and the prospect of kicking the queen around a bit more. Nevertheless, Black's weakness-free po sition is considered at least playable by theory. The next position is from the main-line 7 'ii' g4 Winawer French with 1 e4 e6 2 d4 d5 3 llJc3 .i.b4 4 e5 c5 5 a3 .i.xc3+ 6 bxc3 llJe7 7 1i'g4 'ii' c7 8 'ii' xg7 ltg8 9 'ii' xh7 cxd4 10 llJe2 tt:Jbc6 1 1 f4 .i.d7 12 'ii' d3. Like the Poisoned Pawn Najdorf, it is an old and thoroughly analysed position. White decides that turnabout is fair play in the flank-pawn-grabbing busi ness. By consuming the g- and h-pawns at con siderable cost of time (no pieces out, as usual), he will not only gain material (assuming, for example, that Black at some point captures on c3 and White recaptures), but he also destroys Black's interior defence on the kingside (f6 is a glaring hole, and White' s h-pawn is passed). Black, on the other hand, has superior develop ment, with open files on that same kingside. He also has an extra centre pawn and play down the c-file, once White captures on c3. Years of experience and thousands of games have taught that White must suffer for his excursion, but that if Black's attack fails, the second player will sometimes succumb to the two bishops in an ending. This line is still evolving, and its the oretical verdict is still 'unclear', suggesting at the very least that White has not violated any valid general principles with his pawn-hunting. Moving away from queen pirating raids for a moment, there are any number of openings in which one side grabs a pawn on the flank and then defends it. The diagram on the following page comes from the Slav Defence: 1 d4 d5 2 c4 c6 3 llJf3 llJf6 4 tbc3 dxc4 5 e4 !? b5 6 e5 llJd5 7 a4 e6 (D). But in fact, there are a slew of such lines in the Reti, other Slavs, and the Queen's Gambit Accepted (e.g., 1 d4 d5 2 c4 c6 3llJc3 dxc4 4 llJf3 b5 5 g3 e6, 1 d4 d5 2 c4 dxc4 3 llJf3 lDf6 4 llJc3 a6 5 e4 b5 6 e5llJd5, and 1 d4 d5 2 c4 c6 3 tt:Jf3 tt:Jf6 4 llJc3 e6 5 .i.g5 dxc4 6 e4 b5). We won't dwell on the details here, but it's worth
20 SECRETS OF MODERN CHESS STRATEGY
pointing out that Black isn't giving up the cen tre and his development (see that c8-bishop?) for a pawn alone. He also hopes that his pawn mass on the queens ide will exert a cramping in fluence on White's development, and will eventually be turned into a decisive passed pawn or two. The price he pays is to be sub jected to an attack, which accounts for White's willingness to enter such lines. Both sides' as sessments are pragmatic ones, based as always upon concrete analysis. Very few masters will play such lines unprepared! But unlike the queen raids described above, this type of pawn-grab does have an honourable predeces sor from the nineteenth century, namely the King's Gambit ( 1 e4 e5 2 f4 exf4 3 tt:\f3 d6 4 d4 g5, for example). To conclude this section, let's take a look at a long-standing debate about the following flank pawn grab: Nimzowitsch - Capablanca St Petersburg 1914
1 e4 e5 2 tt:\f3 tt:\c6 3 tt:\c3 tt:\f6 4 i.b5 d6 5 d4
i.d7 6 i.xc6 i.xc6 7 'it'd3 exd4 8 tt:\xd4 g6 (D) This is a fun example for more than one rea son. Capablanca was certainly no great fan of the fianchetto (only marginally more so than the other great players of his day), but he does indicate in his writings that he favoured the fianchetto in Ruy Lopez-like positions where ... exd4 had been played. That he was willing to expend time in this fashion is a bit surprising, since Steinitz and even Nimzowitsch, in similar positions, tended to urge restraint of the e4- pawn by ... .te7, . . .O-O, ... :te8 and ... i.f8. And w in this particular case, the move practically loses a pawn by force. 9 tt:\xc6 Coincidentally, an article by Kasparov in ChessBase Magazine about precisely this con test just fell into my hands (as we will see, this game has attracted attention for many years). He claims that 8 ...g6 is dubious because White can continue with 9 i.g5 i.g7 1 0 O-O-O, e.g., 1 0 ...h6 ( 10 ... O-O? 1 1 tt:\xc6 bxc6 12 e5 ! dxe5 1 3 l�Vf3 wins) 1 1 i.h4 O-O 1 2 f4, when 12 ... l:.e8 loses to 1 3 tt:\xc6 bxc6 14 e5, etc. Nimzowitsch goes after a pawn instead. 9 ... bxc6 10 'fi'a6 'it'd7 What else? 10. .. c5? 1 1 'ir'c6+ tt:\d7 12 i.g5 ! is just awful. 11 'it'b7 l:lc8 12 'fi'xa7 So White is a pawn up. Was this an inten tional sacrifice? McDonald, in his book Posi tional Sacrifices, frames the issue nicely by reviewing historical opinion and adding his own: " ... Euwe remarks at move 8 that 'it was not so difficult to see the loss of a pawn by force in two or three moves, but Capablanca apparently did not imagine that such a thing could happen in the solid Steinitz Defence of the Ruy Lopez. Capablanca's mistakes are just as clear as his good moves.' "Neither Nimzowitsch nor Euwe could com prehend that Capablanca had deliberately sac rificed the pawn. Euwe calls it an 'accident with a happy ending' . Capablanca himself saw things differently: 'I believe [Nimzowitsch] has been unjustly criticized for losing the game ... [the critics] have all suggested moves here and there; but the games of the great masters are not
THE CENTRE AND DEVELOPMENT 21
played by single moves, but must be played by connected plans of attack and defence, and these they have not given."' [remarks and ital ics are McDonald' s; the Capablanca quote is from My Chess Career] . McDonald goes on to explain that, as op posed to Nimzowitsch and Euwe, "any modern player would appreciate the value of Capa blanca's concept", an interesting claim. I might rephrase this to assert that, in addition, any modern player would recognize Black's main threats in the position, and probably defend a great deal better than Nimzowitsch subse quently does! 12 .. . i.g7 13 O-O O-O McDonald maps out a further course for Black (put the rooks on the open queenside files and manoeuvre a knight to c4 ), and he believes that White lacks a good plan, which he (cor rectly) calls one of the 'key features of a posi tional sacrifice' , i.e., that while the sacrificer can improve his position, his opponent has dif ficulty doing the same. But is it true in this case? I marked this posi tion for further study while reading his book, because it didn't seem plausible that Black had enough for a pawn. Remarkably, I was later browsing through Dvoretsky and Yusupov's Training For the Tournament Player, and found a short but excellent commentary by Shere shevsky on this very topic. 14 'ir'a6 lUe8 (D) w Here Nimzowitsch played 15 'ir'd3 'iWe6 16 f3, and after 16. .. tLld7 17 ..td2 ('?' Kasparov, who gives 17 ..tf4 tLle5 18 i.xe5 i.xe5 19 l:tab1) 17 ... tLle5 18 'ii e2 tLlc4, Black had a great deal of pressure ( .. J:ta8 and ... l:teb8 will fol low), and went on to win. A Benko Gambiteer would be particularly happy here as Black. But Shereshevsky writes: "I found the right explanation for what happened in Znosko Borovsky's book [The Middlegame in Chess]. He writes that if your opponent bas a lead in time (in development) but you have extra mate rial, in no circumstances should you divert to defensive duties any pieces which are exerting pressure on the enemy position. Such pieces may be placed perilously, involving some risk, but they prevent the opponent from manoeuv ring freely. From the a6-square the queen at tacks the pawn on c6 and prevents Black from regrouping with .. .'i'e6, ... tLld7, ... tLlb6(e5), and ... tLlc4. The correct move was 15 f3 ! . It is nec essary to reckon with the reply .. J:ta8, but then White may play 'i'c4. The essence of the matter consists in not removing the queen from a posi tion where it is attacking the c6-square." He then compares this position to a Poisoned Pawn Najdorf, in which the black queen on b2 or a3 is subject to attack, but also 'prevents White from manoeuvring freely'. What to make of all this? In the first place, I don't believe that Capablanca intentionally sac rificed the pawn. It is hardly in his style, and I personally don't believe that the sacrifice is quite sound. Capablanca himself, a very proud man when it came to admitting mistakes, did not even claim to have sacrificed the pawn, and in fact, in his notes in My Chess Career, strongly implies that he just moved quickly and lost a pawn. He calls 8 ...g6 "a novel idea, brought out at the spur of the moment". It is interesting that Kasparov, perhaps following the lead of other annotators, simply assumes that Capablanca sacrificed the pawn intentionally, calling it 'a profound concept' . This is a little strange, since he also thinks that 8 ...g6 should have led to a large disadvantage against White's most natu ral moves (see his note to White's 9th move). In any case, this rift of opinion is fascinating, but not very important. As for the position it self, I have looked at Shereshevsky's 15 f3 ! at some length, and personally believe that, al though Black has some compensation for the pawn, it is not sufficient. At some point, unable to achieve the ... tLld7-e5-c4 idea efficiently, he probably has to play ...d5, and there can easily
22 SECRETS OF MODERN CHESS STRATEGY
result an ending which only White can hope to win. More interesting still is Znosko-Borovsky's defensive 'principle'. This rather subtle notion is an example of the sort of context-sensitive rule which could still be relevant in modern chess, as opposed to the sweeping generalities of old. Sometimes, of course, hightailing it back home with that exposed queen is in fact the right thing to do, and the ftrst step in a suc cessful consolidation. In the Trompowsky vari ation cited above, for example, the idea ... 'ii' b4, and after c3, ... 'ii' a5, often followed by ... 'ii' c7 or ... 'ii' d8, is a good defensive strategy. Neverthe less, the prophylaxis exerted by the queens in Shereshevsky's two examples strikes me as both effective and typical of such positions. The Really Big Centre One of the most confusing aspects of positional chess involves the value and drawbacks of a large, mobile pawn-centre. Classical texts tend to emphasize that, if Black doesn't challenge the centre, White should at any rate play e4 and d4 and advance those pawns judiciously to cramp the opponent. For the record, by the way, classical theory seems to imply that if God were playing White, his goal would be to reach this position: But not often addressed is the question of whether, given a free hand to play e4 and d4, White should also throw in f4 and/or c4. Inter estingly, the ftrst reaction to most modern black defences which don't commit a pawn to the fourth rank has historically been some attempt to throw three or more pawns forward to over run the opponent's position. In the early days of the King's Indian Defence (in the 1 920s), for example, the Four Pawns Attack was very pop ular: 1 d4 lDf6 2 c4 g6 3 lDc3 i.g7 4 e4 d6 5 f4. It never has been since. And when the Pirc De fence ftrst gained acceptance (say, in the 1 960s), White played the Austrian Attack (1 e4 d6 2 d4 lDf6 3 l2Jc3 g6 4 f4) often and with gusto; in those days, e5 tended to follow quickly, whereas today, White is more circumspect. Similarly, when the Modern Defence carne upon the scene (late 1960s and early 1 970s), the line 1 e4 g6 2 d4 .i.g7 3 l2Jc3 d6 4 f4 was exhaustively analysed, whereas now White tends to play more modestly. Moving away from examples involving ...g6, the Four Pawns Attack against Alekhine's Defence ( 1 e4 lDf6 2 e5 l2Jd5 3 d4 d6 4 c4 lDb6 5 f4) used to be far more popular than it is now. And in the Griinfeld Defence, the romantic age of f4s with g4s and/or f5s (as in Spassky-Fischer, Siegen Olympiad 1 970: 1 d4 lDf6 2 c4 g6 3 l2Jc3 d5 4 cxd5 l2Jxd5 5 e4 l2Jxc3 6 bxc3 .i.g7 7 .i.c4 c5 8 lDe2 lDc6 9 .i.e3 O-O 10 O-O "ikc7 11 :tel l:td8 12 h3 b6 1 3 f4 e6 14 "ikel l2Ja5 1 5 .i.d3 f5 1 6 g4, etc.) has given way to more manageable central formations for White, such as c3/d4/e4/f2. But there are exceptions. In confronting to day's irregular openings, it may sometimes be best simply to abandon restraint and charge with the troops, as in this Karpov effort against the vaunted 'Kangaroo' opening: Karpov - Miles Bie/ 1992

The Mobile Central Pawn-Mass Overall, then, chess-players have drifted away from these mega-centres. This leaves open the
THE CENTRE AND DEVELOPMENT 23
issue of how the treatment of a normal central pawn-mass (with, say, two leading pawns) has evolved. Let's start with what Nimzowitsch said. Speaking of the advance of centre pawns in one game, he says: "the pawn advance was no isolated, self-contained process. On the con trary, it derived its strength from the readiness of the pieces behind them to occupy central squares." This rings as true today as it did then. If one's pieces can't follow and support the at tack, central pawn advances tend (with excep tions, of course) to be premature. The Queen's Gambit Declined, Exchange Variation has long been an opening in which central pawn advances are common. Nimzo witsch himself, in his game as White against Romih, London 1 927, played this line with a rather modern flair:
1 d4 d5 2 c4 e6 3 li:Jc3 li:Jf6 4 �g5

This would have been a good example for Nimzowitsch's pawn-centre chapter. In Zurich 1 934 (one year before our arbitrary 'modern' breakpoint), Euwe played the white side of a Nimzo-lndian against Bogoljubow in a similar fashion: 1 d4 li:Jf6 2 c4 e6 3 li:Jc3 �b4

The basic pawn-roller concept expressed in these games appears frequently throughout modern chess. Although the treatment of such central pawns has become more sophisticated, it has not fundamentally changed since Nimzo witsch's time. Here's a more recent example, again from the Queen's Gambit: Sadler - Murugan London 1993

Jhf7 35 'ii' xd4 ! . Euwe and Kramer do an excellent job of classifying pawn centres according to type, and it might be interesting to compare older and modern treatments of a few of their classifica tions. In a chapter called 'Pawn Preponderance in the Centre' , they discuss two formations of interest. The first is the 'Classic Centre' (e4/d4 versus a d6-pawn and no black e-pawn). Their example is an old Giuoco Piano game Leon hardt-Burn, Karlsbad 19 1 1 : 1 e4 e5 2 lLlf3 liJc6 3 i.c4 i.c5 4 c3 d6 5 d4 exd4 6 cxd4 i.b6 7 lbc3 lLlf6 8 O-O O-O 9 i.b3 (else ... lbxe4 !) 9 ... i.g4 (the only critical move; otherwise h3 and where does this bishop go?) 10 i.e3 h6 (10. .. i.xf3 1 1 gxf3 opens the g-file and permits a later f4; best was 10 ... l:.e8 ! 1 1 'ir'd3 .Bh5 !, ac cording to Euwe, who nevertheless gives 12 liJd2 .Bg6 13 d5 ! lbe5 14 'ife2 with advantage; see a comparable idea in the next example) 1 1 'ii' d3 l::t e8 1 2 liJd2 'ir'e7 1 3 l:.ae1 l::t ad8 1 4 a3 'ii' f8 15 f4 !

White went on to win fairly easily. Are we really any more 'advanced' in such positions today? Perhaps we have no greater understanding, but it must be said that modern players simply don't allow many such posi tions, and when they do, they tend to lash out for counterplay instead of being squeezed to death. Here's an analogous example from mod ern times: Babula - Miladinovic Calicut 1993
1 d4 d5 2 c4 lbc6 3 lLlf3 i.g4 4 cxd5 i.xf3 5
dxc6 i.xc6 6 lbc3 e6 7 e4 We have the same central situation as in Leonhardt-Burn above, but with a black e pawn instead of a d-pawn. Note how from now on, Black ceaselessly tries to weaken and dis turb White's structure, so as not to fall subject to that which befell Burn. 7 ... i.b4 8 f3 'ii' h4+ 9 g3 'ii' f6 10 i.e3 O-O-O 1 1 i.d3 i.a5!

With respect to Nimzowitsch's idea of the strength of the pawn-mass residing in the "readiness of the pieces behind them to occupy central squares", the basic ideas have not changed, but the modern player is probably more willing to make concessions in order to achieve this sort of advantage, as we will exam ine next. Euwe and Kramer call d4/e4 vs e6 or e7 a 'Neo-Classic Centre' , which is far more fre quent in modern chess than the 'Classic' . In the
THE CENTRE AND DEVELOPMENT 25
Semi-Tarrasch Defence, a speciality of the old masters, this formation can arise after, e.g., 1 c4 lLlf6 2 tLlc3 e6 3 rn d5 4 d4 c5 5 cxd5 lLlxd5 6 e4 tLlxc3 7 bxc3 cxd4 8 cxd4 .i.b4+ 9 .i.d2 i.xd2+ 10 'ii' xd2 O-O 1 1 i.c4 (D). The first point to make that is relevant to the evolution of modern chess is that such open, more double-edged systems did not come natu rally to the classical player. I can find only 24 examples of the 6 e4 tLlxc3 idea in a large data base for the years 1 900- 1 935. Of those games, only 4 were played prior to 1930 (one with Alekhine as White, as might be expected) ! The point is that White almost always preferred a line with e3, the more passive position after 5 e3 tLlc6 arising, for example, 264 times in the same time-period. In modern times, of course, the idea of cxd5 followed by e4 became a main line. I think we must credit this change to both the more dynamic spirit of post-Nimzowitsch ian play and the rise of home analysis, which al lowed White to make a better assessment of the risks involved in exposing his queenside in this fashion (the a-pawn and light squares such as c4 can be quite vulnerable, especially given the open c-flle and ideas such as ... 'ii' d6-a3). At any rate, here is an older example of this position, in which White's treatment is not per fect, but nevertheless very admirable: Keres - Fine Ostend 1937 ll. .. tLld7 12 O-O b6 13 l:tad1 i.b7 14 l:tfe1 l:tc8 15 i.b3 lLlf6 16 'ii' f4 'ii' c7 17 'ii h4 .l:.fd8 18 l:te3 Keres later preferred 18 e5, but keeping the tension is more subtle. 18 ••• b5 19 l:tde1 a5 20 a4 b4!? Euwe gives 20 ... bxa4 21 i.xa4 h6. 21 d5! exd5 22 e5! A fine conception ! For a pawn, White ren ders Black's b7-bishop 'bad' and activates his rooks. 22 ... tLld7? Black still had 22 ... tLle4, in view of 23 e6 fxe6 24 l:txe4 dxe4 25 tLlg5 'i!fc3, according to Keres. This casts the pawn sacrifice into some doubt; compare the next example. 23 tLlg5 tLlf8 24 tLlxh7! lLlxh7 25 l:th3 'ii' c1 26 'ii' xh7+ 'it>f8 27 .i:.he3 d4 28 'iih8+. 'it>e7 29 'ii xg7 l:tf8 30 'iVf6+ 'it>e8 31 e6 1-0 The following very famous example has both similarities and differences. On the one hand, White plays the same kind of pawn sacri fice (d5/e5), and targets the black king. On the other hand, his compensation is much more po sitional, and more in line with Nimzowitsch's remark about the pieces occupying central squares. It is also a more correct sacrifice. In fact, the whole idea was conceived by Poluga evsky and Spassky in home analysis, which re duces its creative status by comparison with a daring over-the-board stroke. However, this in a sense allowed Polugaevsky to be more creative, in that such an abstract form of compensation and the rather anti-intuitive attack which fol lows could probably not be risked by a success ful practical player without preparation.

Of course, there's nothing revolutionary in all that, but the pawn sacrifice to shut out the bishop and get a knight to d4 has a modern flavour to it (see the section in Part 2, Chapter 3 on positional pawn sacrifices). The powerful influence of concrete home analysis is another (perhaps less fortunate) sign of the times. A similar situation to that described in the Semi-Tarrasch has arisen in the Griinfeld De fence. If you look at old databases ( 1900- 1935), White tended to choose one passive line or another against this defence. For example, 1 d4 ll'lf6 2 c4 g6 3 ll'lc3 d5 4 lt:Jf3 �g7 5 e3 was extremely popular, intending the mighty 6 �d2. No wonder people were giving 3 ...d5 an ' ! ' . In the modern era, the main approaches be came 5 'ii' b3 dxc4 6 'ii' xc4 O-O 7 e4 and 4 cxd5 ll'lxd5 5 e4 ll'lxc3 6 bxc3, accepting the chal lenge of defending a large centre in return for the its dynamic potential. In fact, the dynamism exhibited in one of the current main lines is typical of the modern approach to many posi tions:
1 d4 ll'lf6 2 c4 g6 3 ll'lc3 dS 4 cxdS ll'lxdS S
e4 ll'lxc3 6 bxc3 �g7 7 ll'lf3 cS 8 l:tb1 O-O 9 �e2 (D) Now 9 ... 'ii' a5 10 O-O! is one of those times when grabbing pawns, either by 10 .. .'itxa2 or 10 ...

Nothing in this section is utterly offensive to the tenets of classical theory. Nevertheless, modern practice is clearly more confrontational and also takes some of these hyper-critical po sitions to the extreme, in contrast to the careful and sedate 'one or two pawns only' practice of pre-modern chess. We will explore truly revo lutionary conceptions of the centre and pawn play in Part 2. Surrender of the Centre For our last introductory mini-topic, we exam ine a subject close to Nimzowitsch's heart: the 'surrender of the centre' . Nimzowitsch gives us one of his homespun metaphors about the posi tion after 1 e4 e6 2 d4 d5 3 tt:'lc3 dxe4 4 tt:'lxe4
(D):
8 "If, in a battle, I seize a bit of debatable land with a handful of soldiers, without having done anything to prevent an enemy bombardment of the position, would it ever occur to me to speak of a conquest of the terrain in question? Obvi ously not. Then why should I do so in chess? ... pressure exerted on the enemy centre by the long-range action of rooks or bishops directed on it can well be of corresponding importance. "We meet this last case in the variation 3 ... dxe4. This move, so wrongly described as a surrender of the centre, as a matter of fact in creases Black's effective influence in the centre very considerably; for with the removal by ... dxe4 of the pawn at d5, which is an obstruc tion, Black gets a free hand on the d-file, and the long diagonal b7 to h1, which he will open for himself by ... b6. Obstruction ! That is the dark side of the occupation of the centre by pawns." Well, one might imagine that 3 exd5 or 3 e5 was White's only chance for equality! Of course, this was part of a greater polemic against Tarr asch, who considered 3 ...dxe4 inferior. Nimzo witsch's other favourite opening in this regard was Philidor's Defence, e.g., Leonhardt-Nim zowitsch, San Sebastian 1912: 1 e4 e5 2 tt:'lf3 d6
3 d4 tt:'lf6 4 tt:'lc3 exd4 (sometimes Nimzowitsch
delayed this capture, and the year before against Teichmann, had also tried the strategy of strong-pointing e5) 5 tt:'lxd4 i.e? 6 i.e2 O-O 7 O-O tt:'lc6 (D) followed by .. J:te8 and ... .Bf8. His idea was first to stop White's e5 (re straint), and then train his forces against the tar get on e4, finally either forcing a concession or liquidating it via ...d5. Alas, Nimzowitsch's
28 SECRETS OF MODERN CHESS STRATEGY
argument ignores White's greater space and manoeuvrability, and in fact, both of these openings disappeared into obscurity as the years went on (recently, the 3 ... dxe4 French has undergone a slight revival; but it is being used as a drawing weapon for Black with a quick ... c5, hardly what Nimzowitsch had envis aged). What's more, the similar lines of the Ruy Lopez with ... exd4 have always been con sidered better for White. Today, players are not inclined to cramp themselves so without reward. However, there are a number of openings in which a similar surrender of the centre is justified. In most cases, this is because the dark-squared bishop, instead of sitting dully at e7 or f8, takes up a dy namic post on g7. For example, in the King's Indian Defence there are a number of lines with ...exd4/lt:Jxd4 and consequent pressure down the e-file and along the h8-al diagonal. One re cent example is the rather Nimzowitschian 1 d4 li:Jf6 2 c4 g6 3 lt:Jc3 i.g7 4 e4 d6 5 li:Jf3 O-O 6 i.e2 e5 7 O-O exd4 8 lt:Jxd4 l:te8 9 f3 lt:Jc6!?, in which one of Black's primary ideas is to play ... lt:Jh5 and ...f5, to break down White's grip on the centre. A radical example is Adorjan's line
1 c4 g6 2 e4 e5 3 li:Jf3 i.g7 4 d4 exd4 5 lt:Jxd4
li:Jf6 6 li:Jc3 O-O 7 i.e2 l:.e8 8 f3, but now we see that Adorjan will have nothing to do with mere 'restraint' of White's centre. Rather, his idea is active and tactical: 8 ...c6! 9 i.g5 h6 10 i.h4 d5 ! 1 1 exd5 cxd5 12 O-O lt:Jc6 1 3 lt:Jxc6 bxc6 14 i.f2 .i.e6 1 5 lt:Ja4 lt:Jh5 ! 16 cxd5 .i.xd5 17 :tel \Rg5 18 �h l li:Jf4 19 .i.fl .i.c4 with excellent activity, Bobotsov-Adorjan, Vrnjacka Banja 1 972. This surrender of the centre for the sake of dynamic activity, as opposed to mere re straint, is more typical of modern theory. And how about the Caro Kann after 1 e4 c6 2 d4 d5 3 li:Jc3 dxe4 4 lt:Jxe4 ? Well, to some ex tent, Nimzowitsch would be right to say that play down the d-file is what offers Black chances, but the rest of his formula is a bit lack ing (it is not usually effective to play ...b6 or ... g6, for example). As with other modern ex amples of the 'surrender of the centre', Black's most realistic plan is not restraint and attack on the enemy pawn, but rather, early liquidation. In the case of the Caro-Kann (and the 3 ... dxe4 French, by the way), this usually involves the move ...c5. The same pawn structure can arise via the newly-popular Scandinavian Defence, for in stance: Kasparov - Anand PCA World Ch match (game 14 ), New York 1995

This has interesting consequences: in what fol lows, Black neither puts serious pressure on d4, nor does he play the liquidating ...c5 or ...e5. Rather, his compensation for the surrendered centre consists of active piece play. This is an il lustration that such positions must be assessed on a variation-by-variation basis, and not ac cording to general principle. 6 lt:Je5 .i.e6! 7 .i.d3 li:Jbd7 8 f4 g6 9 O-O .i.g7 10 �h1 .i.f5! 1 1 .i.c4?! e6 12 .i.e2 Kasparov mentions 12 lt:Jxd7 �xd7 1 3 .i.e3 l:thd8 with a slight advantage for Black.

THE CENTRE AND DEVELOPMENT 29
Black has a small advantage due to his some what better placed pieces. Thus (although this is an exceptional example), surrendering the centre sometimes incurs no penalty whatso ever. It really comes down to concrete analysis. This could lead us into a general discussion of small centres and restraint. Hedgehog and Sicilian centres ( ...d6/ ...e6 versus pawns on e4 and c4, or just e4, with an open white d-file) have some similarities to Nimzowitsch' s sur rendered centre, despite the lack of an open black central file. Those structures have be come increasingly popular and have the dy namic characteristics Nimzowitsch sought from his Frenches and Philidors. We will be looking at them in some detail in Part 2.
3 M inorities, Majorities, and
Passed Pawns The passed pawn, and the pawn majorities used to create passed pawns, have traditionally been accorded a lot of attention in instructional and theoretical books. Similarly, these works tend to devote at least a section to the minority at tack, as exemplified by the Queen's Gambit Ex change Variation. In this chapter, we briefly review that older theory, and then take a look at modern conceptions of these subjects. Proba bly the most important changes here concern the relative value and importance we now at tach to these elements of play. Minority Attacks The minority attack is a strange area of theory. As far as I know, Nimzowitsch, who was very concerned with the restraint of pawn majori ties, never dealt with attacking them from a po sition of numerical inferiority. Pachman claims that this concept first entered the chess con sciousness in the 1920s, and thus attributes great historical value to the following game: Capablanca - Lasker World Ch match (game 1 1), Havana 1921

For one thing, note how Lasker accepts a very cramped position with moves like 1 2. .. ltJf8 and 1 6. .. ..1le8, and antici pates a Nimzowitsch or Petrosian with the pro phylactic ... =..e7-c7. He even allows a white knight into d6. All of this is consistent with Lasker's tendency to play inferior positions with defensive potential, counting upon his brilliant resourcefulness to outplay his oppo nent later. From his standpoint, the concession ultimately forced upon him by the d6-knight namely, giving White a bishop-versus-knight advantage - may have seemed rather small. But Capablanca proceeds to show that such advan tages are generally decisive, as we know today. First, he continues his minority attack: 27 b5! l:.bc8 28 bxc6 l:.xc6 29 l:.xc6 l:.xc6 30 axb6 axb6 Pachman points out that "White has appar ently merely helped Black to achieve his strate gic aim of obtaining a passed pawn from his queenside majority." But of course, isolated passed pawns can be either weak or strong, and Black's b-pawn and e-pawn are clearly weak here. By forcing Black to defend both points (see our later discussion of the 'two weakness' theory), Capablanca is eventually able to infil trate Lasker's position and win: 31 l:.e1 'ii' c8 32 ltJd2 ltJf8 33 ltJe4 'ii' d8 34 h4 .I:tc7 35 'ii' b3 l:.g7 36 g3 =.. a7 37 ..llc4 l:.a5 38

.. xf8+ 1-0 In a broader sense, any time two pawns ad vance against three, or one against two, we have a minority attack. In books, the concept at some point became narrower. Pachman acknowl edged in 1 960 that "nowadays we use the term [minority attack] to refer mainly to the strategic attack used in various lines of the Queen's Gambit". For readers who aren't familiar with the structure he refers to, it arises, for example, after 1 d4 d5 2 c4 e6 3 ttlc3 tLlf6 4 cxd5 exd5 5 J.g5 J.e7 6 e3 ttlbd7 7 J.d3 c6 (D): w As is described in great detail in the standard texts, White's minority attack consists of b4- b5. Then if Black plays ...c5, dxc5 will leave him with an isolated d-pawn. The move ... cxb5 also leaves Black's d-pawn isolated, and results in a position in which Black's a- and b-pawns are rather exposed. For example, if after ...cxb5/J.xb5, Black plays ... b6 to defend his b-pawn against attack down the newly-opened b-file, then White can play a4-a5 (another mi nority attack!) and expose new weaknesses. Finally, if Black allows bxc6/. ..bxc6, Black's c-pawn is backward and weak on an open file. The last option is the most common one once White achieves b5. As Pachman says of a game in which Keres played ... J.d7 and after bxc6, ...J.xc6: "In almost all positions of this type, it is a mistake to retake on c6 with a piece: a pawn on c6 can generally be defended more easily than the weak pawns on b7 and d5." This is an observation that remains true to this day. In the Tarrasch Defence to the Queen' s Gambit, for example, the main-line Rubinstein Variation goes 1 d4 d5 2 c4 e6 3 ttlc3 c5 4 cxd5 exd5 5 ttlf3 ttlc6 6 g3 ttlf6 7 J.g2 J.e7 8 O-O O-O 9 J.g5 cxd4 10 ttlxd4. Now after a few moves, Black often plays ... J.d7; but when White plays ttlxc6, it is still correct to recapture by ...bxc6 and not ... J.xc6. Hundreds of games have shown that the position after the former recap ture has more inherent strength and dynamic potential. Finally, the reader is referred to the Part 2, Chapter 3 section on backward pawns, for some rather surprising statistics on how well Black does with this backward ... c6/ ...d5 pawn structure. How has the minority attack evolved in mod ern chess? I would say in two contrary direc tions: a) To a large extent, this Queen's Gambit Exchange Variation was worked out between 1930 and 1970. Several interesting defences to this minority attack, and counter-plans for White, were developed and played extensively. As a consequence, the best ways of playing for White and Black became well known. In fact, for the most part, White has switched to a num ber of other ways of approaching these posi tions (we discuss central expansion via f3 and e4 elsewhere in this book, for example). To my mind, as this particular form of double d-pawn opening continues to decline in frequency, the extreme attention devoted to it in the books has become out-of-date; b) The only marked advance in the theory of minority attacks that I can think of has been as sociated with the black minority advance in the Sicilian Defence and similar structures. Indeed, the Sicilian Defence minority attack was known in the 1 920s, but not so much so that books made mention of it. Later, with the Sicilian De fence explosion, that minority attack became one of the main reasons why White felt obliged to launch attacks at an early stage against Black's position (I am speaking of Open Sicil ians, of course, characterized by 2 ttlf3 and 3 d4 ). Since there are literally thousands of ex amples of Black's minority-attack strategy, I thought I'd use a few by GM Pal Benko, whom I watched for many years playing successful minority attacks on an almost routine basis:

achieve ...a6 and ... b5, a minority attack to chip away at White's bind. If White has to accede to the exchange cxb5/ ... axb5, Black may then fol low up with ...b4, to immobilize and target White's a-pawn. One of White's best responses to this plan can be to utilize his own majority, a subject to which we now turn. Majorities and Candidates Steinitz first drew attention to the subject of pawn majorities as a separate element of the game. For years thereafter, teachers and theore ticians put great stock in majorities, and in par ticular, in the queenside majority, which was supposed to be a significant advantage. How often have we read an annotator saying that one side or another has an advantage due to his queenside majority? But as chess has evolved, the value of the queenside majority has become controversial. For one thing, we have just seen positions in which a minority is more effective than a majority. Furthermore, the advance of a majority will often simply expose weaknesses behind the very pawns which have advanced. It is interesting to look at majorities in terms of the passed pawns they potentially create. This is the traditional reason for liking queen side pawn majorities, i.e., that a passed pawn created from it in the ending will be an outside passed pawn, far from the reach of the kings (which are presumably on the kingside). An as sociated reason is given by Pachman: "In the middlegame, [the queenside pawns] are easier to advance without weakening one's own king position." In other words, both sides may be able to create passed pawns, but the player with the queenside majority will be able to do so ear lier and with less risk. He adds: "A queenside majority shows to best and lasting advantage in positions where ... the reduced material has cut out the danger of an attack on one's own king. This is usually the case in the transition stage between middlegame and ending." That's pretty much the traditional view. One of Nimzowitsch's contributions was in focus mg on the mobility of pawn majorities, i.e., to point out that majorities are only useful to the extent that they are mobile. He also systemati cally worked at restricting the mobility of ma JOrities in his own games. In the following example, Colle seems to be thinking along the same lines: Spielmann - Colle Dortmund 1928 Black threatens ... i.c5. White's next move not only prevents this, but prepares for the later advance of his majority by c5. 17 lt:Ja4 b5! At the cost of a pawn, Black now cripples that majority. One feels that Nimzowitsch would approve. As Pachman points out, White's two extra pawns on the queenside are very difficult to convert into a passed pawn, and Black's bishop gains a beautiful post on d6, aiming at the kingside. Suddenly, too, the knight on the rim (a4) is out of the action, and Black's oppo site-colour bishop has no counterpart on the side with his majority. In short, Black has full compensation for his pawn. 18 cxb5 i.d6 19 l:tael 'it'e7! 20 i.d3 lt:Je5 21 'it>h1 f4 This unopposed pawn threatens to cause damage by ...f3.

34 SECRETS OF MODERN CHESS STRATEGY
Today, the theory of the queenside majority has changed very little, but its relative impor tance has declined. Modern openings abound in which one side or the other voluntarily accepts a queenside minority; such minorities may even constitute an advantage as late as the early stages of the endgame. Another serious consid eration is that acquiring a queenside majority tends to mean ceding a central majority. An obvious case of this is on the white side of the Sicilian Defence (which we have already men tioned), as well as in many variations of the 1 c4 e5 English Opening in which, after ...d5, White plays cxd5 and operates with his a- and b pawns against Black's majority. To give a cou ple of concrete examples in other openings, take the French Defence after 1 e4 e6 2 d4 d5 3 lDd2 c5 4 exd5 'ir'xd5 5 lDgf3 cxd4 6 i.c4 'ir'd6
7 O-O tbc6 8 lDb3 tbf6 9 lDbxd4, and the Caro

Nevertheless, one can still find examples of effective queenside majorities. In the Modern Benoni, for example, the advance of Black's a-, b-, and c-pawns (his majority) is essential to his success in nearly every line. Or, in the Hedge hog, consider this typical position (D): w Polugaevsky - Ljubojevic Bugojno 1980 Elsewhere in this book, we will see how White plays similar positions with b3, c4, and e4 versus this Hedgehog structure, but has trouble dealing with Black's latent dynamism (see especially Part 2). Here, however, White's pieces are well-placed for a more ambitious plan, the activation of his majority: 15 b4! l:tac8 16 a3 'ii' b8 17 lDb3 h6 18 'i!Vf2 Notice that White's point is not so much the creation of a passed pawn as it is direct pressure on Black's queenside, eventually opening lines there. 18 ... i.c6 19 h3 i.e7 20 l:tb1 'ii' c7 21 l:tdcl 'ii' a7 22 a4! A real majority attack commences. Now a5 is a major threat, but something like 22 ... 'ii' b8

hopeless for Black, so he strikes back in the centre: 22 ... d5 23 exd5 exd5 24 aS i.xb4 25 axb6 'ii' b8 26 c5 So Black has maintained material equality, but his weak a-pawn and White's two con nected passed pawns give the first player a clear advantage. 26 ... i.b7 27 i.d4 l:te6?? Black neglects his trapped bishop, but 27 ... i.xc3 28 l:r.xc3 would be excruciating to defend.

The begin nings of a trend? Perhaps; but it will take thou sands of such games to make up for years of successful minority attacks by Black in this opening. Passed Pawns and the Blockade One of Nimzowitsch's most important contri butions to chess theory involved passed pawns and blockading principles. He related pawn majorities to the creation of passed pawns in a more concrete manner than previous writers, and investigated the blockade of passed pawns so created. What he emphasized, and what re mains true to this day, is that passed pawns could be either weak or strong to the extent that they were able to be restrained and blockaded. His playful characterization of the passed pawn's "lust to expand" remains one of the most potent and relevant images in chess the ory. What it reflects is the enormous damage such a pawn can do when unleashed, even by sacrificing itself; more on this in the next sec tion. But Nimzowitsch's real contribution in volved the concept of blockade. Thanks to him, players today, when facing a passed pawn on e5 or d5, instinctively think in terms of a blockade with a knight on e6 or d6. Nimzowitsch first pointed out what an ideal blockader such a knight was, since it could perform its function and at the same time hit key squares in the en emy camp. This classic formation can arise from any number of openings (D): I have ignored the placement of the queens, rooks, and other minor pieces. White has a pro tected passed pawn and no weaknesses. Tradi tionally, this in and of itself was considered an advantage. But the ideal placement of Black's knight can balance or in some cases even out weigh White's passed pawn. This is because the knight firmly blockades the pawn, attacks e4 and c4, and also supports both the undermin ing move ...f5 and the expansion of the majority by ... b5. There are some variations on this theme, for example, in some cases, White has a pawn on c4, in which case the move ... b5 be comes an undermining move. Or both sides can be without a c-pawn, in which case Black's knight is still difficult to dislodge. Another standard example of this idea, but from the white point of view, arises in the King's Indian Defence (and other 1 d4 open ings), when Black plays ... f5, and White coun ters by exf5/. ..gxf5/f4. If Black then plays ...e4 (with a protected passed pawn), White would

ideally like a knight on e3, to control f5 and d5, blockade the passed pawn, and support the un dermining advance g4. Here is a typical skele tal structure: Nimzowitsch went into great detail to ex plain which pieces were the best and worst blockaders, and in which contexts there were exceptions. He extended this concept of block ade to the general restriction of the mobility of the opponent's pawns, whether they were passed, part of a majority, or simply threats to advance. Although players today are much more aware of and more skilled at implementing blockades than the players ofNimzowitsch's day, his con cepts have not been improved upon, in my opinion. Here's a well-known example from Pachman's play which also brings up a few pe ripheral issues: Vesely - Pachman Prague 1951
1 e4 e5 2 ltlf3 ltlc6 3 i.b5 a6 4 i.a4 ltlf6 5 d4
exd4 6 O-O i.e7 7 e5 ltle4 8 ltlxd4 O-O 9 l:te1 ltlcS 10 .1xc6 dxc6 1 1 ltlc3 (D) This is a fairly standard structure (which could arise from the Ruy Lopez Exchange Vari ation, for example) in which Black's two bish ops are pitted against White's better pawn structure. Black has what is called a 'crippled majority' on the queenside, in that its advance will not lead to the creation of a passed pawn, whereas White's majority does have a passed pawn 'candidate' (in Nimzowitsch's terminol ogy) in the e5-pawn, since f4-f5 and e6 can fol low. But there is a much more important facet
B
to White's majority: after f4-f5, Black's pieces will be terribly restricted, and White will have excellent attacking chances, both by piece play (i.f4, 'ii' g4, l:tad 1 , l:tf3, etc.) and by using his pawns as a battering ram (f5-f6, h4-h5-h6). These threats, and not that of a white passed pawn, drive Pachman to play his next move. l l. . .fS! In fact, Black just gives White a passed pawn for free! But this pawn can be blockaded from the e6-square (with either a knight or bishop), and in addition, Black now stakes out space and gets to play on both wings. 12 ltlce2 Pachman had an earlier game (Foltys-Pach man, Czechoslovakia 1 946) in which his oppo nent rushed to get a 'protected passed pawn' by 12 f4? ! . Today, very few players would con sider this move, which makes his dark-squared bishop a bad piece and even sets up a target for a later black break by ...g5. The game went 12 ... ltle6 13 i.e3 ltlxd4 14 'ii' xd4 'ii' xd4 15 i.xd4 i.e6 (D). w
MINORITIES, MAJORITIES, AND PASSED PAWNS 37
Pachman calls White's game "strategically lost, for he has no effective counterplay against the advance of Black's queenside pawns". Im plicit in this assessment is an acknowledgement of the great superiority of Black's bishops in such a position. This game snippet is a good ex ample of how the whole idea that protected passed pawns are an advantage in and of them selves has disappeared. As so often, an idea which is a force in an endgame (protected passed pawns tend to be decisive in king-and-pawn endgames, for example) tends not to apply in the middlegame (where the same pawns are of ten just a static obstruction). The text move, 12 t0ce2, makes sense, to challenge Black's block ade by lDf4. As Pachman points out, 12 exf6 (e.p.) was also possible, but it would free Black's bishops.

Major-piece endings, for example (ones with queens and rooks) are notoriously decided in favour of the side with the more ef fective and/or more advanced passed pawn. From the standpoint of modern middlegame theory, the more interesting issue concerns the role of passed pawns earlier in the game. When I was growing up, annotators would often point to the creation of a passed pawn right out of the opening and state that the side possessing it had an advantage, the more so if it was a protected passed pawn. As the years went on, players be gan to realize that the 'advantage' of a passed pawn was largely a late middlegame and end game phenomenon; and that very often, the cre ation of an early passed pawn brought other problems with it. There are few modern open ings, for example, which are geared towards the creation of a passed pawn. Normally such a pawn, especially on the flank, is fairly easily blockaded in the early-to-middle parts of the game, and a well-blockaded passed pawn (es pecially if isolated) is often a serious weakness. Suba, as we will mention in Part 2, believes that outside passed pawns tend to be weaknesses in the middlegame, and we will cite evidence to support that. At this point, I want to look at an example of the fight of two outside passed pawns versus a central majority: Salov - M. Gurevich Leningrad I987

4 Pawns : In Chains and Doubled Up
This chapter continues our look at pawns. This time we look at two areas with which Nimzo witsch was particularly concerned: pawn-chains and doubled pawns. The reader should keep in mind that these are subjects which will be taken up in a very modem context in Part 2; the dis cussion of pawn-chains there is particularly im portant. Here I just want to set the scene and have a look at some traditional issues. Nimzowitsch's New Ideas The first thing we should point out about Nim zowitsch's exposition on pawn-chains is that he was mostly concerned with the structure that arises from the French Defence Advance Varia tion: 1 e4 e6 2 d4 d5 3 e5. There is a good rea son for this: his 'born enemy' Tarrasch had given 3 e5 a '?' . In Nimzowitsch's own words, his "attempt at resuscitating" 3 e5 was aimed at the purpose of "undermining Tarrasch's ... po sition" and "slowly but surely weakened the position of the Nuremberg champion". This was no idle sideline for Nimzowitsch; he also bragged about how his discovery of the Nimzo-lndian and Queen's Indian "conclu sively destroyed ... the position of Tarrasch as a generally acknowledged teacher of chess un derstanding". He even recommends that every one find a born enemy to improve one's play! Well, of course, the Nimzo-lndian and Queen's Indian are still two of the most irritat ing openings to play against that man has ever invented. Today, in fact, these two brainchil dren ofNimzowitsch probably frustrate players of 1 d4 more than any other defence. But the French Advance Variation has never really caught on among the top players, despite the occasional mini-revival, and certainly not in the way Nimzowitsch played it. Nevertheless, his exposition (and his examples) to this day dominate the instructional and middlegame books. Let's take a look at his most famous game with the French pawn-chain: Nimzowitsch - Salwe Karlsbad 191 1
1 e4 e6 2 d4 dS 3 eS cS
Attacking the base of the pawn-chain (d4); Nimzowitsch was the first to enunciate this as a 'principle' of pawn-chains. He pronounced at tacking the base of the chain (as opposed to the front, in this case at e5) 'a strategic necessity'. In fact, in this position, 3 ...c5 indeed makes more sense than 3 .. .f6; but we shall see in Part 2 that attacking the base of a pawn-chain is by no means a necessary step, and that failing to de stroy the base doesn't by any means foredoom an attack on the front.

6 ... i.d7?! After this game, 6 ... cxd4 was considered better. Another famous game, Nimzowitsch Tarrasch, San Sebastian 1 9 1 2, with that move illustrates what we would now consider more conventional pawn-chain play: 7 cxd4 i.d7 8 i.e2 (a loss of tempo, showing why 6 i.e2 - or
6 a3 !? - is played today instead of 6 i.d3; ironi
cally, Tarrasch had commented many years be fore that this loss of tempo 'refuted' the opening, and that if the bishop couldn' t take up its 'natural' post on d3, that White's whole sys tem was refuted !) 8 ... lbge7 9 b3 ti:Jf5 10 i.b2 i.b4+ 1 1 �fl . and here Nimzowitsch himself

either 17 ... .Be8 or 17 ... l:tf8, Black has more than enough for the exchange, since the white king is exposed, his d-pawn is hard to protect, and there are weaknesses all over the kingside. Instead, Tarrasch continued with 1 l ...i.e7 12 g3 a5? 1 3 a4 .:tc8 14 .Bb5 ti:Jb4 15 ti:Jc3 ! , and White had secured control over b5 (assisting the support of d4) and was probably already slightly better.

(Nimzowitsch). In fact, 8 ...a5 ! (preventing White's next and considering ...a4 in several lines) is a much better move, and under explored, due to the rarity of 6 .Bd3 .Bd7. But that is another story. 9 b4! .Be7 10 .Bf4 fxe5 1 1 tt:Jxe5 tt:Jxe5 12 .Bxe5 ti:Jf6 (D) w White's whole conception was quite new at the time. In this respect, Nimzowitsch shared a fundamental belief with the other hyper moderns: that the centre did not have to be oc cupied by pawns; rather, the central squares could be controlled by pieces. This seems so laughably obvious now that it's hard to believe that it needed stating. And of course, con fronted with the position before us, it's not as though the very best players, such as Tarrasch, Lasker or Capablanca, would have thrown up their hands in horror or preferred Black! But Nimzowitsch and the hypermoderns brought new notions about the centre into general con sciousness: that one could 'surrender' the cen tre by moves such as dxc5 and exf6 (or in the case before us, by allowing ...fxe5, which is structurally the equivalent of exf6/ ...tt:Jxf6) and still have the better central position; and that, similarly, one could control the centre from afar (with fianchettoed bishops, for example) . One has to keep in mind that the exemplars for generations of players were the Evans Gambit, King's Gambit, Giuoco Piano (lines with 4 c3 and 5 d4) and other openings in which White achieved or at least strove for the 'ideal' centre with both e4 and d4 in. No one talked about controlling the squares e4 and d4; the goal was to occupy them. Thousands of exemplary and informal games with the same theme can do a lot towards closing minds! 13 ti:Jd2! Rushing every available force to the control of d4 and e5.

But it took even more mistakes for White to lose the game. Nimzowitsch's description of pawn-chain strategy still dominates the textbooks. But how are pawn-chains handled in practice today? On the one hand, his simple model of attacking the base of the chain still applies in some cases. For example, in the old main line of the King's In dian Defence (Classical Variation), this posi tion has appeared hundreds (if not thousands) of times (D): White idea is to attack the 'base' at d6 by c5 (actually, there are even cases in which he then tries to undermine the 'real' base at c7 by b4- b5-b6), whereas Black is attacking the 'base' at f3 by ... g4 (I can't think of a single case in which he then had time to play ...h5-h4-h3 to undermine g2, however). This is very much a la Nimzowitsch. What we will see in Part 2, however, is that there are other ways of dealing with pawn-chains. Attacking the front of the pawn-chain, which Nimzowitsch condemned, is becoming increasingly popular in a number of openings. We will also examine how entirely different various pawn-chain openings (such as the French and King's Indian) are, once you consider which structures are playable and, for example, what roles the minor pieces play in each opening. Nimzowitsch and Doubled Pawns There will be scattered discussions of doubled pawns throughout this book; in this section, I would like to summarize briefly Nimzowitsch's contributions to this topic, before examining how the treatment of doubled pawns has evolved. In both his play and writings, Nimzowitsch did a great deal to modernize the treatment of dou bled pawns. For one thing, he developed two openings, the Nimzo-Indian ( 1 d4 lllf6 2 c4 e6 3 lll c3 i.b4) and French Winawer ( 1 e4 e6 2 d4 d5 3 lll c3 i.b4 ), in which the move ... i.xc3 tended to create doubled pawns in a great many variations. Nimzowitsch developed a theory about the restraint of doubled pawns, consider ing them much like passed pawns, i.e., full of dynamic potential if they were allowed to re main mobile. These theories have survived mostly intact to this day. A couple of his games should clarify the major issues:

i.b7 6 lbf3 i.xc3+ Nimzowitsch took great delight in making this exchange without the gain of tempo which normally occurs when White plays a3. Al though he expressed disdain for that tempo, modern players value it much more, and in very few variations does Black voluntarily play ... i.xc3 like this. The one striking exception is the Hiibner Variation of the Nimzo-Indian, which will be discussed Part 2, Chapter 7; the move-order there is 4 e3 c5 5 i.d3 lDc6 6 tbf3 i.xc3+ 7 bxc3, which was the position from which Nimzowitsch won one of the most fa mous blockading games of all time (versus P.Johner in Dresden 1926). 7 bxc3 d6 8 'ii' c2 lDbd7 9 e4 e5 Now the position has taken on features typi cal of a Nimzo-Indian Defence.

On the other hand, if White plays d5 without being provoked by ...c5, Black gains two important advantages: a fine square c5 for his knights, and more importantly, the possibility of opening the position against White's queenside by ... c6.

Nim zowitsch rightly spends a good deal of time on the options, commenting upon them in both My System and Chess Praxis.

Such games have influenced middlegame books up to this day. The standard examples of doubled pawns given in these books tend to be B even more one-sided affairs where the owner of the doubled pawns is slowly constricted and overrun. But modern practice has evolved in a more balanced direction, as we shall see. First, a short detour: An Old Dispute One of the earliest points of contention in the theory of doubled pawns had to do with the Ruy Lopez Exchange Variation, 1 e4 e5 2 tt::l f3 tt::l c6 3 .tb5 a6 4 .txc6 dxc6. This opening often leads to a queenless middlegame, pitting White's static advantage (his opponent's doubled pawns) against Black's dynamic ones (the two bishops and an open central file). The 'Exchange Ruy' still has a number of interesting features which make it relevant to modern chess. For one thing, White, possessing the knight-pair, faces a di lemma: whether or not to open the game. This question, which is absolutely critical in modern minor-piece play, will be looked at in great de tail in Part 2. But also of interest is the eternal argument about whether two bishops in and of themselves constitute an advantage; this too is discussed at length in Part 2. Let's jump into these issues by looking at one of the most fa mous games in chess history: Lasker - Capablanca St Petersburg 1914
1 e4 e5 2 tt::l
f3 tt::l c6 3 .tb5 a6 4 .txc6 dxc6 5 d4 Well, that's one question out of the way: Lasker, with the knight-pair, wants to open the position without delay! 5 ...exd4 6 '1Wxd4 '1Wxd4 7 tt::l xd4 (D) Capablanca comments: "For many years, the great Lasker considered that this position was theoretically won for White because of White's preponderance of pawns on the kingside. It is true that if all the pieces were to be exchanged ... White would win ... His famous predecessor, Steinitz, on the other hand, never had any faith in the efficacy of this system. He maintained that with the two bishops and free game Black had more than enough compensation ... I am in clined to agree with Steinitz." (Last Lectures). 7 ... .td6 "Black's idea is to castle kingside. His rea son is that the king ought to remain on the weaker side to oppose later the advance of White's pawns ... whether in practice that would be the best system would be rather diffi cult to prove." (Chess Fundamentals). Behind all this is the opposition of static and dynamic strategy. The modern view is that nor mally, it's better to acquire these 'permanent' weaknesses early on, so that one has all the more opportunity to transform them via dy namic play into something favourable. In other words: the later one acquires a weakness, the less probable it is that one can repair or work around it. Black later found ways to enhance his bishop-pair in this position by castling queen side (Capa to the contrary notwithstanding), and then opening lines. An excellent example of this was Petterson-Alekhine, Orebro 1 935: 7 ... .td7 8 .te3 O-O-O 9 tt::l d2 tt::l e7 (or 9 ...c5 10 tt::l e2 b6 1 1 O-O-O tt::l e7 12 ll.he1 tt::l c6 13 h3 .te7 14 tt::l f4 ll.de8 1 5 tt::l d5 .td8 = Ljubojevic Beliavsky, Tilburg 1 986) 10 O-O-O :e8 1 1 l:r.hel tt::l g6 12 tt::l e2? ! .td6 13 h3 f5 ! 14 exf5 tt::l h4 !

Although the Exchange Variation is still played periodically, it seems that the theoretical debate has been more or less settled, with the bishops achieving a comfortable equality. When White wins, interestingly, it is almost always by structure-changing pawn-breaks which, sup ported by tactics, create squares for the knights. Here's an example: Fischer - Spassky Match (game 9), Sveti Stefan/Belgrade 1992

As we will discover in Part 2, it tends to be a major mistake for the owner of the knight-pair to build up slowly, relying on the theory that one must keep lines closed to the bishops. The like lihood is rather that, once the possessor of the bishops achieves a stable pawn structure with equal development, it will be too late for the knights to be effective. Tactically, White's frrst point here is that 15 ...fxe5 fails to 1 6 axb6 cxb6 17 tZ:le4 ..te7 18 J:xd8 ..txd8 19 tZ:lbxc5+. 15 ... ..te7 16 J:xd8 ..txd8 17 tZ:le4! 'it>c6??

As theory has evolved, the bishops have been shown to hold their own or better in this venerable line. The Evolution of Doubled-Pawn Theory Nimzowitsch's work set the standard for the modern view of doubled pawns, and we still see his ideas used in the opening named after him. In the next example, we investigate how those ideas have evolved. Yusupov - Karpov Linares 1993
1 d4 lLlf6 2 c4 e6 3 lLlc3 i.b4 4 e3 c5 5 i.d3
lLlc6 6 a3 i.xc3+ 7 bxc3 O-O 8 lLle2 b6 9 e4 lLle8! I think that Nimzowitsch would like this re- fined modern move-order with 8 ...b6 (to pres- sure the c-pawn by ... i.a6) and 9 ... lLle8, which (a) avoids i.g5, (b) anticipates White's idea of f4-f5 by preparing the blocking move ...f5, and (c) prepares ... lLld6 with further attack on that c4-pawn as well as support for f5. We take such ideas for granted today, but they were learned by dint of lengthy experi ence. Compare the game Bronstein-Najdorf, Candidates tournament, Budapest 1950, which, after the same first 7 moves, went 8 lLle2 d6! ? (this slightly weakens the centre) 9 e4 lLle8 10 O-O b6 11 f4 i.a6? (D) (the last chance for .. .f5).
12 f5 ! e5 13 f6 ! . Now the black kingside is
breached, because 13 ... lLlxf6 14 i.g5 puts too much pressure on the kingside, e.g. 14 ...exd4 15 lLlg3 ! (threatening lLlh5) 15 .. .'ii' c7 16 .l:txf6! gxf6 17 i.xf6 and it's all over. So Najdorf con tinued 1 3. .. �h8 1 4 d5 lLla5 15 lLlg3 gxf6 (this cedes the f5-square and the game - a traditional doubled-pawn theme, by the way - but what else was to be done versus 16 fxg7+ lLlxg7 17 i.h6?) 16 lLlf5 i.c8 17 'i!fh5 i.xf5 18 exf5 .l:tg8 19 :f3 :g7 20 i.h6 l:tg8 21 .:.h3 1 -0. Black's problem was insufficient restraint of the king side pawn-mass, but it took years to develop the exact methods by which this was possible. The prophylactic concept of ... lLle8/ ...f5/ ... lLld6, however, evolves naturally from the ideas of Nimzowitsch himself.
10 O-O i.a6 1 1 f4 f5 12 lLlg3 g6 13 i.e3 (D)
A very interesting position. At this point, most players (and especially players immersed in classic examples of how to restrain and then attack the doubled-pawn complex) would play a move such as 13 ... lLld6 (which has indeed been played here), 13 ... d6 or 13 ... 'ir'e7 (prepar ing the standard attack via ... lLla5 and/or ... .l:tc8). Our chess education has impressed upon us how the bishops must not be freed, and how a stable, fixed structure favours the knights; after all, why else did we play the moves ... lLle8, ... f5, and ...g6?
50 SECRETS OF MODERN CHESS STRATEGY
But Karpov finds another solution, which is illustrative of the evolution of modern posi tional theory: 13 ... cxd4! 14 cxd4 d5! Black not only undoubles White's pawns, but he plays a move which opens lines as well ! With all due respect to Nimzowitsch, I don't believe that he (or any of his contemporaries, certainly) would have considered this idea. What is typically modern is Black's focus on colour complexes; and again, in many doubled-pawn positions, the player fighting against the dou bled pawns allows their liquidation in order to exploit the weak squares which they leave be hind. 15 cxd5 The light squares also fall after 15 'iir' a4 ltJa5 ! or 15 exf5 exf5 16 cxd5 i.xd3 17 'iir' xd3 'iir' xd5, and ... ltJd6 follows. 15 ...i.xd3 16 �xd3 fxe4 17 'ii' xe4 'ii' xd5! 18 �xd5 exd5 19 l:r.acl l:r.c8 20 f5! This is obviously necessary soon, or Black will have a simple case of strong knights versus White's miserable bishop on e3.

White's bishop would be out, but the knights are still obviously better, and White's d-pawn would re quire attention as well.
21...hxg6 22 l:.xf8+ �xf8 23 h4!
White is responding ingeniously to Black's threat of a bind. This move involves the sacri fice of a pawn, but gives White much-needed counterplay, as we will see. 23 ... ltJc4 24 i.g5 ltJxd4 25 h5? Karpov rightly suggests 25 l:tfl+! �e8 (but maybe 25 ... 'it>g8 is a better winning try) 26 .:.e1 + �d7 27 l:te7 + �c6 28 l:.g7 ! . Even if Black gets two passed queenside pawns after 28 ... ltJxa3, White's passed h-pawn will be a major force, good enough to equalize. 25 ... gxh5 26 l:r.fl+ �e8 27 ltJxh5 ltJxa3 28 liJg7+ �d7 29 l:.f7+ �c6 30 .:.xa7 ltJac2! After a forced sequence, Black's knights are poised to escort the b-pawn in.

Pachman is very critical of this move, and he is probably right. But consider its value in terms of classical theory. With one move, Black stakes out territory in the centre and frees his c8-bishop; with three central pawns on dark squares, this should be an excellent bishop in deed. On top of that, Black can envisage forcing White to resolve the central situation after, for instance, ... ltJc6. Then if White plays d5 and e4, he takes on an awful light-squared bishop, but if he exchanges on e5 or c5, White's central mo bility will disappear and his c-pawns will be not only doubled, but isolated. Something like this must have gone through Kan's mind, but... 1 1 dxe5! dxe5 12 i.d3 h6 13 O-O O-O (D) Remarkably, it is Black's pawn structure that is worse here ! Why? Because White has the wonderful outpost square on d5 for both his knight and bishop, whereas the 'weak' doubled

pawns cover similar squares (especially d4) for Black's pieces. Such ideas have become typical in modern chess, but at the time, the notion of taking on such isolated doubled pawns (and without a compensating attack) was unknown. 14 f4! In similar positions today, White uses an other interesting plan, involving the transfer of a knight to d5, for example, by e4, .l:.fd l , and lLlfl-e3-d5.

knight. In Part 2, we will talk about the lack of dogmatism which characterizes modern chess. In these two games, Botvinnik demonstrates the concrete, pragmatic attitude which took over from the principle-based play of his prede cessors. He correctly assesses that his superior piece play will force a favourable transforma tion of the game (either by change of structure or win of material) before the long-term, static difficulties with his pawns ever come into ef fect. 17 ... l:tad8 18 l:%.d5 b6 19 l::tfd 1 li:la5 20 h3 l:txd5 21 l:txd5 'ile7 22 i.g4!

The advance of White's king side pawns and centralization of his king decide easily: 29 ... a5 30 c4 b5 31 cxb5 li:lxb5 32 e5 a4 33 f4 li:ld4 34 Rf2 g5 35 g3 gxf4 36 gxf4 li:le6 37 �e3 c4 38 f5 li:lc5 39 %4c7 li:ld3 40 e6 fxe6 41 fxe6 1-0 I want to emphasize this modern pragmatic attitude towards what have traditionally been considered weaknesses. Today, players allow doubled pawns in all kinds of positions, merely because they know that the weaknesses can't be exploited, or because those pawns are useful in covering squares or even helpful in attack. Let's look at one more example from Botvinnik's play: Botvinnik - N. Sorokin USSR Ch, Moscow 1931 Black's position is without serious weak nesses, so if White is to achieve anything, he should do so quickly. Ironically, if it were Black to move, he might consider playing the creative 20 ...i.e6! , allowing doubled pawns himself, since after 21 i.xe6 fxe6, he covers d5, opens the f-file, and contests the light squares. But it is White's move, and Jeremy Silman percep tively points out that both the aggressive a5 as well as White's threats to the e5-pawn "are thwarted by Black's queen, which is doing a su perlative defensive job." Thus: 20 'ile3! To quote Silman: "How many players would refuse to even look at this move because of the doubled, isolated pawns?" At the time of Bot vinnik, my guess would be that top players might well have overlooked this idea. But inter estingly, we see such practical moves regularly from today's leading players, who are not much interested in theoretical considerations when they can smell a dynamic kill.

29 �cc7 �bc8 30 �xt7 �xc7 31 �xc7+ '1t>h8 32 .td5 b5 The end. Black's knight is paralysed on a5, and White just toys with his opponent before cashing in:

Here's an irresistibly entertaining example: Lilienthal - Smyslov Piimu 1947 This position looks quite solid for Black. One would think that White might play .te3 and try to swing the queen to the kingside, or find a way to force concessions by playing a well-timed tbg3. But Lilienthal finds an aston ishing way to continue: 12 fxe5 dxe5 13 dxe5!?!? tbdxe5 Hang on here ! White has four pawn islands and four isolated pawns, including the doubled pawns and a serious weakness on e4. On top of that, Black, with nary a weakness, is already occupying the ideal square e5 with his knight! How can White possibly justify his play? 14 tbf4 First, he believes that the d5 outpost is worth quite a bit. But beyond that, White's c-pawns cover the d-file, so that a black knight can't come to d4. And in some cases, the f-file may come in handy. This is all a bit hard to believe, but just the fact that someone of Lilienthal's stature would play this way, and that it's not clear who is in fact better, shows how complex the subject of doubled pawns can be. 14 ... .tg4!? Whereas White has been undogmatic in the extreme, maybe Black needed to be a little bit more stereotyped, and not exchange White's only bad minor piece. In my opinion, some thing like 14 ... O-O 1 5 tbd5 'i!Vd6 seems called for, e.g., 16 .tf4 .ta6 l 7 'i!Va4 tba5 18 �ad1 �ae8 19 .te2 .tb7 with a promising, if unclear, position. 15 .te2 .txe2 16 'ilr'xe2 f6 17 tbd5 'ii' f7 Mayer mentions 17 ...

He wants to play a5, even though it appears that Black will easily prevent that. Of course, with hindsight, one could argue that this is probably forced, since otherwise .. .'ii'b7-a6 could soon follow. 20 ... tbc6 21 'ilr'g4 <;i(h8 22 a5! tbxa5 23 e5 f5 24 'i!Ve2 White's entire conception is unbelievably in genious. Now he has a passed pawn with a pow erful lust to expand! This seems to offer enough compensation for the pawn, probably even more than enough. 24 ... �ae8 25 l:lael �e6

White now embarks upon a standard simplifying proce dure: 16 lZ:\d5 'ii' xd2 17 lZ:\xf6+? gxf6!! But he had not taken this fine reply into ac count. Normal would be 17 ... .txf6 18 l'hd2 �e7 19 h4, with White "perhaps a little better" (Anand). 18 l:.xd2 h5! Anand comments: "At first glance White is better, or at least not worse, in view of Black's damaged pawn structure. However, White is actually seriously worse. If White could con solidate his kingside pawn structure by h3 then he would indeed be better, but just at the mo ment this is impossible." 19 .l:.g1 Anand gives 1 9 .te2 hxg4 20 fxg4 llh3 with Black better. 19 ...hxg4 20 fxg4 .tc4!! A paradoxical move in the modern spirit. This stops h3, but at the seemingly devastating cost of trading Black's very good bishop for White's very bad one. Just look at those weak nesses on d5 and f5 ! Anand comments: "Black's 'bad' e7-bishop will protect his pawns while he forces pawn exchanges eventually leading to connected central passed pawns." In Part 2, we will hear from Suba about his claim that 'bad bishops protect good pawns ! ' ; this is a sterling example.
21 b3 .txn 22 l:.xfl .l:.h3 (D)
"Black appears to have committed a whole list of positional sins: allowing doubled f-pawns, giving White an outside passed h-pawn and ex changing his 'good' bishop with ... .tc4; yet he is better. Paradoxical? Yes, but this doesn't mean that the old positional rules have been suspended for the course of this game." (Anand). He goes on to explain that his rook on h3 dis rupts the white position and that Black has the long-term plan of exchanging his d-pawn for White's e-pawn by ...d5, and his f-pawn for the g-pawn by ... f5, to give him connected central passed pawns. Well, I guess there are two ways of looking at this, but I think most people would say that such rules have not only been 'suspended' for this game, but have also shown to be unreliable guidelines ! The whole point of rules is that they
PAWNS: IN CHAINS AND DOUBLED UP 55
allow the player to use them in the place of ex tremely lengthy calculations to confidently en ter certain types of positions, as Ivanchuk has done here. Of course, if by achieving the better bishop and classically superior pawn structure (holes on d5 and f5), White had allowed a mat ing attack, one could argue that, after all, you can't expect too much from rules. But when, in a simplified position with Black's e7 -bishop contributing no activity, the mere presence of one active rook can throw such a position en tirely in Black' s favour, I think we can rightly question whether such rules are serving their purpose. Put this another way: how many other players in the world would have played l7 ... gxf6, at the same time foreseeing 20 ... �c4 (or come to think of it, even played 20 ... �c4 given the enormous advantage of being given that position to think about)? My guess is: very, very few (after all, Anand himself gives ' ! ! ' to both moves). But why? Because we would au tomatically reject this combination of ideas on principle. We put our faith in these rules, and dogmatically assume that the good bishop and far better pawn structure will favour White. It is one of the insights of modern players, and espe cially of the best ones, that one has to play the position itself, not some abstract idea of the po sition. In fact, as we shall see, the development of that simple notion characterizes most of the progress which chess has made in the modern era. To return to the game, what follows is com plicated and messy, but the essence of it is that Anand's insight about the passed pawns (which only come into being 12 moves after his origi nal decision! ) proves to be true. 23 .:t.e2?!

0-1 Quite a game! We will see other examples of unusual and creative doubled-pawn positions in Part 2; but before closing this chapter, let's turn briefly to a closely-related subject: Tripling Up In many modern openings, doubled pawns are pitted against dynamic piece play. But in a few, those doubled pawns arise from what are ini tially tripled pawns. That anyone would be so optically challenged as to cheerfully allow his pawns to be tripled may strike us as unusual, but in the two cases we will look at, just to make it worse, those pawns are on an open enemy file as well! Let's briefly examine these case stud ies of the modern emphasis on activity and op portunism. In the Catalan Opening, one of the main (and quintessentially modern) variations goes:
1 d4 d5 2 c4 e6 3 4Jf3 4Jf6 4 g3 i.e7 5 i.g2
O-O 6 O-O dxc4 7 4Je5 4Jc6!? 8 ttJxc6 Robatsch invented 7 ...4Jc6 ! ? in the 1 970s, and it was quickly noticed by unstereotyped players such as Petrosian and Geller. Black is willing to accept doubled - and even tripled - pawns to fight back against White's centre and achieve active piece play. Consider 8 �xc6 bxc6 (D). White can allow Black to keep his tripled pawns for a move more by 9 4Jc3 ! ?, but then their use as a battering ram is illustrated after 9 ...c5 ! 1 0 dxc5 �xc5 1 1 'i!i'a4 4Jd5 ! 12 4Je4 4Jb6 13 'i!i'c2 'ii d5, and White still has to justify his pawn minus.
56 SECRETS OF MODERN CHESS STRATEGY
So more typical is 9 lbxc6 'ii' e8 10 lbxe7+ 'ii' xe7 1 1 'ii' a4, leading to a characteristic posi tion in which Black counts upon his activity, the opposite-coloured bishops, and White's slight kingside weaknesses to make up for his pawn minus (and the isolated a- and c-pawns), e.g., 1 l ...a5 !? ( 1 l ...e5 is also unclear) 12 'ii' xc4 i.a6 13 'ii' c2 l:.fd8 14 l:.d1 c5 ! 15 dxc5 l:.xd1+ 16 'ii' xd 1 'ii' xc5 with plenty of activity, Stohl Polak, Czechoslovakia 1 990. 8 ... bxc6 9 lba3!? Now White takes on a pair of doubled pawns! It is very typical of the evolution of doubled pawn theory that, increasingly, we see positions where activity is emphasized over even serious permanent pawn weaknesses. Here White gains a very active bishop-pair in return for the weak a-pawns (and more importantly, in return for al lowing Black another tempo to improve his own position). The obvious 9 i.xc6 l:.b8 10 lbc3 i.b7 ! 1 1 i.xb7 l:.xb7 yields a very instructive position in which the other advantage of the tripled pawns, pressure along the b- and d-files, comes into play, for example, 12 e3 c5 13 'ii' f3 l:.d7 ! 14 dxc5 'ilic7 15 c6 l:.d6 and Black has no prob lems. 9 ... i.xa3 10 bxa3 i.a6! (D) This position merits some discussion. De spite the doubled a-pawns, White's structure is certainly healthier, and he has two bishops and an extra centre pawn. These are classical ad vantages which would probably have fright ened off players from Black's position even during Botvinnik's reign (when the bishops held sway), as well as in pre-modern times. In fact, 7 ... lbc6 leads to a number of such positions, entirely dependent upon dynamic imbalances and open lines, which accounts for its not being taken seriously until the last few decades. In the diagrammed position, specifically, we see Black achieving a lead in development as White recovers his material. The tripled pawns yield Black play on the b- and d-files, which is critical, and he gets time to set up a blockade style position which justifies his possession of the knight. We shall now follow the course of an interesting and thematic game: Vladimirov - Vaganian Moscow 1990 1 1 i.xc6 Karpov demonstrated Black's active strategy against Antunes in Tilburg 1 994 after 1 1 i.g5 h6 12 i.xf6 'ii' xf6 13 i.xc6 l:.ab8 14 1Wa4 .l:.b6 1 5 l:.fd 1 l:.d8 1 6 i.f3 ! c6! 17 'it>g2 'ii' e7 1 8 e3 .l:tc8 ! 1 9 h4 i.b5 20 'ii' b4 c5 2 1 dxc5 .l:txc5 22 l:.d8+ �h7 23 l:.ad1 i.c6! with a large advan tage to Black. l l ... l:.b8 12 'Wi'a4 l:.b6 13 i.g2 lbd5 14 'it'c2?! Vaganian suggests 14 'ii' a5 ! ?, which he con siders equal. 14 ... f5! Kotronias rightly praises this move, which prevents White from kicking the knight away from its powerful post on d5.

This threatens to double rooks, so White is forced to straighten out Black's pawns, and the c3-pawn also gains in strength. 20 .UXb6 cxb6 21 .l:.el bS! Now ...a5 and ...b4 is threatened. White's next move prepares i.f2 and i.h3, but Black uses the new opportunity to enter a position with much superior activity.

The real moral here is that there's a long stretch between the early middlegame and the endgame. In this game, by the time that stage was reached, Black had straightened his queenside pawns and ironi cally, it was White's doubled a-pawns that al lowed Black's passed c3-pawn to become a major force. Another opening in which tripled pawns routinely arise is the French Defence Winawer Variation ( 1 e4 e6 2 d4 d5 3 lbc3 .Bb4 ), in which White ends up with the triplets after, for example, 4 e5 c5 5 a3 .Bxc3+ 6 bxc3 CiJe7 with White playing dxc5 shortly thereafter. There are a number of such lines, but they all depend upon the same ideas as we saw in the Catalan: use of the b- and d-files, an outpost on d4, a lead in development and activity while Black is re covering his pawns, and even a central lever with c4, analogous to Black's ...c5 in the above examples. Let's see how this idea works: Smyslov - Uhlmann Mar del Plata 1966
1 e4 e6 2 d4 dS 3 CiJc3 i.b4 4 eS tDe7
Smyslov first played with the tripled pawns against Botvinnik in the 20th match game of their 1 957 world championship, which went 4 ...c5 5 a3 .Bxc3+ 6 bxc3 'flic7 7 'ilig4 f6 8 CiJf3 lbc6 9 'ilr'g3 'ii f7? ! 10 dxc5 ! lUge? l l .Bd3 fxe5 12 lbxe5 with a solid advantage for White.
5 a3 .Bxc3+ 6 bxc3 cS 7 CiJf3 i.d7 8 a4
Another hotly-disputed tripled-pawn line arises after 8 dxc5 (D), again with the idea of grabbing the initiative with moves like .l:.bl , lbd4-b5, and/or .l:.b4-g4 in some cases. As in our main line (after 8 a4 ), this set of tri pled pawns comes with features not existing in the Catalan Opening examples above. The white e5-pawn, for one, can be a cramping fac tor, but it also temporarily lacks support. An other difference is that Black already has one more piece out than White, so pure speed of de velopment is not an advantage as it was for the holder of the tripled pawns in the Catalan. To make up for this White has ideas of CiJd4-b5 and l:tbl-b4, which in conjunction with the e5- pawn can put great pressure on Black's posi tion. One of the original games with 8 dxc5, Spassky-Korchnoi, Candidates match (game 10), Belgrade 1 977, went 8 ... 'ili'c7 9 .Bd3 1La4 ! ? 10 l:tbl ! (in their 8th match game, 10 O-O CiJd7 1 1 tDd4!? lUxeS ! 12 .Bb5+ i.xb5 13 CiJxb5 'ili'xe5 14 .l:.el CiJe4 ! 15 f3 a6! handed the initiative to Black; 10 l:tbl ! drives Black's pieces back as quickly as possible) 10 ... CiJd7 1 1 .l:.b4 1Lc6 12 O-O CiJxc5 1 3 .l:.g4 ! CiJg6 14 CiJd4 O-O-O 15 f4 i.d7 16 .l:.g3 <l;b8 17 'ife1 'it>a8 18 h4 ! CiJxd3 19 cxd3 h5 20 1Le3 l:Ide8 21 a4 ! with a serious ini tiative and pressure on both sides of the board (although White later played poorly and lost). It's extremely interesting that one solution to this approach came in the form of a radical pawn sacrifice for activity and initiative, in the modern spirit. From the diagram (after 8 dxc5), Renman came up with 8 ... .Ba4 9 .l:.b1 lbd7 ! 10 .l:.xb7 lbxc5, simply giving up a pawn to coun terattack along the c-file and retake the initia tive from White, for example, 1 1 l:tb4 'ifa5 12 CiJd4 O-O 13 'ikg4 ! ? 'ii' c7 ! 14 f4 a5 15 l:txa4 ! ? (since 1 5 .l:.b2 CiJe4 is clearly favourable for Black) 15 ...

(D)
Thus the tripled pawns arise, and on an al ready-occupied open file ( 10 ... l:tc8) to boot! What's more, the e5-pawn is irrevocably weak ened and will almost certainly fall. It is a tribute to both Smyslov's imagination and modern pragmatism that such a line was discovered af ter years of Winawer practice. White's point is that rather than defend his centre, he will use d4 as a pivot post for his knight and open as many lines as possible for his bishops. Up to this move, Black was ready for ... cxd4 and simplifi cation, but now he has to reorganize. Having said that, Black has some advantages here which White lacked in our Catalan exam ples: a) he has plenty of active pieces developed; b) he has a strong grip on the light squares, so that the move c4 by White tends to activate Black's pieces at least as much as White. These dynamic features lead to a complex and balanced struggle. l l. .. lLlg6 12 O-O O-O Later, it was discovered that Black could safely capture the e-pawn by 12 ... lLlcxe5 here, also with dynamically balanced play. 13 'ii' e3!

Once again, the fundamental struc tural solidity of Black's position keeps him in the game. But the text is perhaps more instruc tive; after it, White uses his two bishops and chips away at Black's optically good centre un til he is left with a clear advantage which he converts in the endgame. It is also particularly interesting that Smyslov refrains from the obvi ous c4 break and is in no hurry to liquidate his tripled pawns: 17 lL:ld6 l:tc7 18 a5 e5 19 l:ttb1 lLld8 20 l:td1 i.c6 21 i.g4! lLle6 22 l:.abl lLle7 23 g3 rs 24 i.h3 g6?! 25 f4! d4 26 cxd4 lL:ld5 27 i.f2 exd4 28 i.xd4 lLlxd4 29 l:txd4 .l:te7 30 �f2 lLlc3 31 .l:te1 l:txe1 32 �xe1 lbe4 33 lLlxe4 i.xe4 34 c3 .l:tf6 35 l:.d8+ �g7 36 .l:.d7+ l:tf7 37 l:.xf7 + cJ;;xf7 38 cJi;d2 cJi;e6 39 c4 cJi;d7 40 cJ;;e3 �c6 41 cJi;d4 cJi;d7 42 cJ;;es ...and White won rather easily. With these examples, we conclude our look at the history and evolution of doubled-pawn theory. Needless to say, doubled pawns are still a disadvantage to their possessor in a majority of cases. But today, we have come far from the dogma which used to dominate theory, and the decision to take on doubled pawns has become a pragmatic one, based upon potentially com pensating factors.
5 The Evolution of the IQP
This chapter deals with the strengths and weak nesses of the isolated queen's pawn ('IQP') and associated structures. This is an issue which has retained its topicality throughout the years; and there are still plenty of players who favour one side or the other. But it is also a good example of a subject which has long since gone into a stage of slow evolution, without any major con ceptual changes. In what follows, we will re view the traditional conception of the IQP, and try to explain refinements to that view in a mod em context. Framing the Issue Steinitz himself, back in the last century, intro duced and explained key features of isolated queen's pawn positions. Not surprisingly for a player who first emphasized the static features of chess positions, he preferred to play against the IQP. Steinitz won several such games ver sus Zukertort, and one of these became a classic which greatly influenced later generations. Later 'positional' world champions such as Petrosian and Karpov also shared this prefer ence for defending against the IQP, whereas Spassky, Kasparov, and (perhaps surprisingly) Botvinnik were all willing to take on the isolani for the free development and attacking chances it offers. Of course, modern players are well aware of the pluses and minuses of the IQP, and in typically pragmatic fashion, will take up ei ther side when it suits them. Nimzowitsch does a good job of reviewing the issues surrounding the isolated queen's pawn, and in My System, he gives a fairly bal anced view of its advantages and disadvan tages. But later, in Chess Praxis (and this shows how much the theory of the IQP had yet to evolve), he turns dogmatic, claiming that the dynamic advantages of the pawn had become 'innocuous' and ridiculing the IQP: "There are engines of war which even twenty years ago were the terror of all belligerents, and yet, to day, they are no more than harmless playthings. Defensive technique has progressed, and this is the reason, today, the dynamic power of this isolated QP has become to us just a plaything, and we find it difficult to understand how any one could take to flight before such a weapon." Regarding hanging pawns, interestingly, he says that "unlike the isolated pawn, this weapon is by no means out-of-date." w Let's talk about the general features of the diagrammed position for a moment, a typical one which can arise from openings such as the Queen's Gambit Accepted, Queen's Gambit Semi-Tarrasch, Caro-Kann (Panov-Botvinnik Attack), the 2 c3 Sicilian (after 2 . .. d5), and the Nimzo-Indian Defence. White's isolated queen's pawn can be attacked directly, of course, but years of experience have led to the following general plan for Black: a) restrain the pawn from advancing; b) occupy the square in front of the pawn; c) simplify; and finally d) attack and destroy the weakness or other- wise favourably transform the structure. Two typical set-ups for Black are: a) ... b6, ... .tb7, .. .'iid6 ... l:.fd8; and b) ...a6, ... b5, ... l:.c8, ... tba5, perhaps fol- lowed by ... tbd5, . . . tbxc3, and ... .td5 with a bind on the light squares. In a nutshell, that's how traditional theory regarded the black side of such openings.
60 SECRETS OF MODERN CHESS STRATEGY
Interestingly, Nimzowitsch suggested that in general, White should build up slowly in these positions by �e3, 'ii' e2, l:tac 1 and l:tfd 1 , and place his king' s bishop on d3 or b 1 (but, he added, "not b3"). In the modern view, this is entirely too passive, and it's no wonder that Nimzowitsch eventually turned against the IQP, given his view of how White should pro ceed. Instead, modern players beginning with Botvinnik felt that White should develop rap idly and centralize his rooks (e.g., by �g5, 'ii' d3, l:tad 1 , l:tfe1), and then try to play either d5 or probing moves on the kingside. Against Black's second plan above with ...a6, ...b5, etc., White has some new options involving tZ:\e4- c5. Let's see a game from the days in which White's IQP attack was regaining popularity, based on this more active treatment: Szabo - Van Seters Hilversum 1947 (from the diagram) 1 1 l:te1 b6 12 'it'd3 .Bb7 13 .Bg5 l:tc8 Criticized by Pachman, who nevertheless of fers this instructive line to show that White maintains some advantage after 13. .. tZ:\d5 : 14 �xd5 exd5 (14. .. .Bxg5 15 .Be4 h6 1 6 d5 with the initiative, e.g., 16 ... exd5 17 tZ:\xd5 .Bf6 18 l:tad 1 ! ) 1 5 .Bxe7 tZ:\xe7 16 tZ:\g5 tZ:\g6 17 h4 h6 18 tZ:\e6 fxe6 1 9 'ir'xg6 'ii' xh4 20 'ir'xe6+ 'it>h8 21 'ir'e3 l:tae8 22 'ir'd2 with White better due to his good knight versus Black's bad bishop. 14 l:tad1 'i'c7!? 15 .Ba2 llfd8 16 h3 l:t.d7
(D)
Black has logically opposed the d-pawn and white queen with his rook on the d-file, but now falls victim to the pawn's 'lust to expand' : 17 d5! This pawn-break epitomizes White's strat egy, and its playability tends to determine the first player's success from this type of position. Notice how d5 breaks down Black's solid bas tions on e6 and f7, thus increasing the influence of White's a2-bishop. It also activates the rook on d 1 and queen on d3, lengthens the range of the rook on e 1 , and opens up numerous squares for White's knights (d5, d4, and f5, for exam ple). Of course, the move is also based upon tactics, for if Black can win the d-pawn and then simplify, White may just lose. 17 ... tZ:\xd5 Unfortunately for Black, 1 7. ..exd5 loses to 18 .Bb1 g6 1 9 l:txe7. 18 .Bxd5 'ii' d8 And here 18 ... exd5 loses material after 1 9 tZ:\xd5. 19 'it'e4 exdS 20 tbxd5 �xg5 21 tZ:\xg5 g6 It's all over; 21...'ii'xg5 allows mate after 22 'ii' e8+. Notice how active all of White's pieces have become. 22 'ii' h4 h5 23 tiJf6+ 'it'xf6 24 l:txd7 tZ:\dS 25 l:te8+ rj;g7 26 :txf7 + 1-0 It's remarkable how many such games White has won. Even in modem times, Karpov has al lowed a devastating d5 more often than would seem possible from such a brilliant defensive player. On the other hand, he and other defend ers have won their own share of games in which White's initiative petered out and his long-term weaknesses eventually allowed Black to take over the game and win. Theoretically, this type of position is still regarded as dynamically bal anced. In general, as Nimzowitsch and others point out, the IQP helps the attack in the middlegame, because it supports aggressive outposts like e5 and c5 and stakes out space, which gives the white pieces more freedom of movement. Con versely, the IQP is held to be a weakness in 'po sitions of an endgame character' (Nimzowitsch). That's about as far as traditional theory goes, and it holds up in the main; but it's interesting to examine cases of the IQP in the absence of queens. Pachman provides us with these two examples:
THE EVOLUTION OF THE IQP 61
w Botvinnik - Bronstein World Ch match (game 15), Moscow 1951 Black has relatively active pieces, but few positive prospects. He cannot challenge the d4-square (as he might were the c5-knight on c6, for example, when ... ..tc5 and even ... i¥b6 could be played at the right moment). Thus White is almost certainly better here. White's next move not only blockades the d-pawn, but also threatens liJf5. 10 .!Dd4! 'il'd7 ll liJ2f3 O-O 12 liJe5 'ii' c8 13 i..g5 .l:r.e8 14 liJd3 liJxd3 15 'ii' xd3 'ii' g4 16 ..te3 ..tc5 17 h3 'ii' g6?! Pachman says: "A typical error in such posi tions. After the exchange of queens, Black re linquishes all the tactical possibilities of the middlegame ...". Better was 17 ... i¥h5, since 18 'ii' f5 ..txd4 19 i¥xh5 ltJxh5 20 ..txd4 l:te2 gives enough counterplay. 18 'ii' xg6 hxg6 19 l:tad1 l:te4 20 c3 (D)

20 ... b6? Here 20 ... ..txd4 21 I:i.xd4 I:i.xd4 22 ..txd4 I:i.e8 23 i.e3 was recommended as only slightly better for White. This brings up a point about the IQP: in the absence of a second weakness, it is often impossible for the side playing against the isolani to convert his advantage in the end game to a win. The presence of a defensible back-up position (when things go wrong) is one reason why IQP positions are still quite respect able in selected openings. 21 lDc2 l:td8 22 I:i.d3 �f8 23 .l:f.fd1 �e7 24 �n �d7 25 ..tg5 �c6 26 b4 ..tf8 27 ltJe3 l:te5 Here Botvinnik threw away the fruits of his labour by 28 f4?

Black's last move, 13 ... 'ii' b6, was played on the assump tion that the disappearance of queens favours the side playing against the isolated pawn (as in our last example). But this position shows that space, activity, and outposts (in this case for the knights, on e5 and c5) are still advantages in somewhat simplified positions: 14 a5! ii'xb3 15 liJxb3 ..trs 16 lDe5 liJb4 17 l:tacl 17 lDxf7 liJed5 18 liJd6 ltJc2 is unclear. 17 ... liJed5 18 a6! b5 19 ..txd5 cxd5 20 ltJc6! ltJxc6 21 .l:r.xc6 l:r.fe8
62 SECRETS OF MODERN CHESS STRATEGY
At this point, the game was agreed drawn, but later analysis (quoted by Pachman) demon strated White's large edge. One critical line, for w example, would be 2 1 . ..l:t.fe8 22 l:.xe8+ l:.xe8
23 f3 l:.e1 + 24 �f2 l:.b1 25 tLlc5 l:.xb2+ 26 �g3
g5 27 l:.c7 �g7 28 l:t.xa7 threatening l:t.b7 with a winning advantage. To the end, White's open files and c5 outpost outweighed the weakness on d4; and in fact, 13 ... 1i'b6 is now considered inferior. We might fairly conclude that there are no hard-and-fast rules about simplification in IQP positions; one's best judgement has to be used and the individual characteristics of each position taken into account. The Modern IQP Environment How is the IQP regarded today? To begin with, all those older fights about whether such a pawn is strong or weak have disappeared. Statements like Nimzowitsch's above (from Chess Praxis) are not only insupportable but irrelevant in to day's chess environment. The IQP still appears in many sound variations which are indisput ably playable; but it has also proven a risky proposition in other, formerly standard, posi tions. The fact is, no one cares any more whether it's good or bad to have an isolated queen's pawn; they just care about how good or bad a particular pawn is in a particular position. This is part of the 'rule-independence' and concrete analytical approach which we will discuss at length in Part 2. It might be useful to just list a few of the most common isolated pawn positions in mod ern chess and see in what ways they differ:
OGA
In the Queen's Gambit Accepted, many lines lead to IQP positions. One I find very interest ing arises after 1 d4 d5 2 c4 dxc4 3 lLlf3 lLlf6 4 e3 e6 5 �xc4 c5 6 O-O a6 7 �d3 ! ?. This is a so phisticated retreat which anticipates a loss of tempo following ... b5, which can now be met by a4. White also wants to play dxc5 and e4 in many lines, so Black usually creates an IQP by 7 ... cxd4 8 exd4. Then a typical line is 8 ... �e7 9 tLlc3 O-O 10 �g5 b5 (D). Now, instead of the traditional attempts to attack by l:.e1 , or by 'ii' e2 with l:.fd 1 , White aims directly at the queenside by either 1 1 l:.c 1 �b7 12 �xf6 ! �xf6 1 3 tLle4 (targeting c5 ) 1 3. .. �d5 14 tLle5 with advantage; or by 1 1 a4 b4 12 tLle4 (12 tLlb1, intending tLlbd2-b3-c5 or tLlbd2-c4, is also very promising) 12 ... �b7 1 3 tLlxf6+ �xf6 1 4 �xf6 1i'xf6 1 5 ttJe5 'ti'g5 1 6 g3, also with advantage, since 16. .. tLlc6 can be met by 1 7 tLlxc6 (or 1 7 �e4 tLlxe5 1 8 �xb7) 17 ...�xc6 18 �xh7+ (analysis by Eingorn). This variation illustrates two particularly modern tendencies: the willingness to retreat before developing (by �d3, which also takes strength away from the key d5-square ); and the willingness to play with the IQP in even simpli fied positions (see the various exchanges on f6). Also, we see here an example in which the mobility of the IQP was not an issue; but rather, the space and support squares around it. Over all, this is an example of a 'safe' IQP which, whether White gets the advantage or not, should not lose the game for him. French Tarrasch Keene points out that Tarrasch had such a love for isolated queen's pawns that he gave up the variation of the French Defence which still bears his name today, i.e. 1 e4 e6 2 d4 d5 3 tLld2. In his notes to Tarrasch-Walbrodt, match (game 8), Nuremberg 1894, he comments about 3 ttJd2: "the correct method of play which Walbrodt here selects refutes the move utterly: 3 ...c5 ! 4 exd5 exd5 ! ... ". His reasoning is that White will soon have to grant Black the dreaded IQP after either dxc5 or ...cxd4. Today, this line is indeed regularly played by Black, but the issue is not whether 3 tLld2 is
THE EVOLUTION OF THE IQP 63
'refuted' ; but rather: is White's advantage of a serious nature, or does it dissipate into early equality or a drawn ending? Once again, Kar pov provided some modern ammunition for White's side, winning some beautiful technical battles early in his career; although later on, he preferred 3 tDc3 as his weapon against the French. In my opinion, this is a 'middle ground' case for the IQP, in that a sophisticated player of White will be able to neutralize Black's ac tivity, but will have great difficulty bringing home a full point or even maintaining a long term advantage. One issue is that a great many of the standard endings are drawn, even ones with only a white knight versus Black's 'bad' bishop. Whatever the exact reasons, this line does indeed lead to a high percentage of draws. Let's look at a few fragments to get a feel for the issues: 1 e4 e6 2 d4 d5 3 tiJd2 c5 4 exd5 exd5 5 lDgf3 tDc6 6 i.b5 i.d6 7 dxc5 i.xc5 8 tiJb3 i.d6 9 O-O lDge7 10 .l:[e1 O-O (D). a) 1 1 i.d3 h6 12 h3 tiJf5 13 i.d2!? i.c7 14 i.c3 1i'd6 15 i.b5 ( 1 5 i.xf5 i.xf5 16 tiJbd4 i.e4 17 tDxc6 bxc6 1 8 i.e5 =) 1 5. .. i.b6! 16 a4? d4 !

QGD Tarrasch One of the best-known of isolated pawn varia tions (and another point of dispute between Nim zowitsch and Tarrasch) occurs in the Tarrasch Defence to the Queen's Gambit, the main line of which leads to an isolated black queen's pawn:
1 d4 d5 2 c4 e6 3 tDc3 c5
The Tarrasch Defence has an interesting his tory. Tarrasch himself thought 3 ...lDf6 inferior due to 4 i.g5, and said that he "instinctively recognized" 3 ...c5 as the "right antidote to the Queen's Gambit". He actually believed that isolating Black's d-pawn would give the second player a positional advantage( !), and thus that 3 ...c5 should be met by 4 e3. 4 cxd5 exd5 5 tiJf3 tDc6 6 g3 tiJf6 7 i.g2 il..e7 8 O-O O-O 9 i.g5 cxd4 10 tiJxd4 h6 11 i.e3
(D)
The move 6 g3 was Rubinstein's influential contribution. A series of nice victories with this move threw both the Tarrasch Defence and the IQP itself into a tailspin in the minds of his contemporaries in the 1910s and 1 920s. With Botvinnik and other dynamic players in the 1 930s, the IQP began a steady recovery, but
64 SECRETS OF MODERN CHESS STRATEGY
only in other openings. Remarkably, it wasn't until Spassky adopted the Tarrasch Defence in his 1969 world championship match versus Petrosian that 3 ...c5 itself again achieved re spectability in the minds of most players and theoreticians. Even then, the books gave the main lines as leading to a slight but definite ad vantage for White, and relatively few players followed Spassky's suit. After another hiatus, Garry Kasparov himself used the Tarrasch Defence to fight his way through the 1983-4 Candidates Matches to his first world champi onship match, employing it successfully against Beliavsky, Korchnoi, and Smyslov. Naturally, players were soon playing 3 ...c5 at every op portunity. But, again, the bandwagon screeched to a halt when Kasparov lost two critical games in the world championship against Karpov and moved on to the greener fields of the Tarta kower Queen's Gambit, Grtinfeld, and King's Indian. Today, the Tarrasch Defence is again considered rather marginal, and top-flight prac tical results favour White. Given this history, it would be rash to make any predictions about the future of 3 ...c5; but it does seem that the isolated queen's pawn it cre ates is more subject to attack than the ones we looked at in the last two examples. In the dia gram, for example, that bishop on g2 exerts a lot of influence in comparison with the case of the QGA above, in which Black's bishop on e7 was nowhere near as effective against White's isolated d-pawn. At this point in time, at any rate, White's results are rather good, and there are only a few strong players who are willing to defend the Tarrasch. Let's look at a few excerpts from Karpov's games to get a feel for how White has been posing problems for Black: Karpov - lllescas Leon 1993 (from the previous diagram) l l. .. .l:te8 12 .l:tcl A move which is currently giving Black fits.

Another idea is that after 'ii' b3, if Black attacks by ... .!tJa5, the queen has a comfortable retreat at a2, from which point it still attacks Black's IQP. But 13 a3 ! ? is still rather slow; in fact, the more popular 13 ltJxc6 bxc6 14 .!tJa4 (or 14 .i.d4) has had excellent results for White of late, and even 1 3 .!iJb3 and 1 3 'ii' c2 seem to lead to some ad vantage. Keep in mind, however, that Tarrasch experts, who know more than I do, may know how to hold the balance in such positions.

THE EVOLUTION OF THE !QP 65
19 l:tfd1 i.e6 20 b4 lDf8 21 tba4 tbg6 (D) Now Black's pawns have been utterly immo bilized, on which grounds alone White's strat egy must be deemed successful. 22 'ii' c3! i.d7 23 tbc5 i.xc5 24 i.xc5! White has two bishops, a bind, and central pressure, whereas Black's bishop on d7 is mis erable.

These three isolated queen's pawn openings vary both in the degree to which the IQP-owner is the aggressor as well as in soundness. The in terested reader is urged to study examples from other openings. For example, in the 1 e4 c5 2 c3 Sicilian, two interesting IQP positions arise af- ter 2 ...d5 3 exd5 1i'xd5 4 d4 lDf6 5 tbf3, and now 5 ... e6 6 i.e2 cxd4 7 cxd4 tbc6 8 O-O i.e7 as well as 5 ... i.g4 6 i.e2 e6 7 O-O tbc6 8 i.e3 cxd4 9 cxd4 i.e7. In both cases, tbc3 is best met by ... 'ir'd6, allowing a rook to come to d8 and covering critical squares like f4 and b4, when Black seems to achieve equality. In the Nimzo-Indian, Black has been extremely com fortable in the line 1 d4 lDf6 2 c4 e6 3 tbc3 i.b4
4 e3 c5 5 i.d3 d5 6 tbe2 cxd4 7 exd4 tbc6 8
cxd5 tbxd5 9 O-O O-O, mainly because White's knight on e2 simply fails to have the effect that it did on f3 in earlier examples. This means that ...e5 is often possible, for example. To conclude: the evolution of the IQP in modern chess has been consistent with princi ples worked out long ago. The difference today is in the detailed understanding of specific posi tions, and players' willingness to deploy their forces in unstereotyped ways.
6 Minor-Piece Issues
As the reader will be reminded throughout this book, the relative value of minor pieces (the bishops and knights) stands at the core of mod ern chess. Time and again, superiority in the middlegame is decided by who has the better minor pieces. There are also a number of com mon material transformations that give rise to dynamic possibilities, most prominently the exchange sacrifice (rook for bishop or knight), but also combinations of two or three minor pieces versus the queen. Given that reality, it's rather surprising to see how unimaginatively the traditional texts treat issues regarding minor pieces, and how late in chess history their roles came to be reassessed. In this chapter, I will re view classical theory, giving a very conserva tive view and deferring discussion of major theoretical advances to Part 2. To wrap up the discussion, I take a theoretical and statistical look at the long-standing contention that a queen and knight are superior to a queen and bishop. The Conventional View Nimzowitsch, a brilliant handler of both knights and bishops, said very little about either. In a chapter from My System on the two bishops (a topic he even considered omitting as a separate subject), he discusses the bishop versus knight issue in the most elementary possible fashion, first showing an ending with a bishop escorting in a passed h-pawn versus a remotely-placed and helpless knight. Then he gives this standard example of a good knight versus a bad bishop in an ending (D): I only bother to give the diagram because it seems as though every instructional and middle game book since time immemorial has shown some such thing, and often, that's about the ex tent of their minor-piece discussion! Anyway, Nimzowitsch next talks about endings with two bishops versus two knights (or versus a bishop and knight), in which the two bishops systemat ically hem in the knights and eventually win. The most interesting such ending is this one, because it relates to our Ruy Lopez Exchange Variation discussion from Chapter 4:

Harmonist - Tarrasch Breslau 1889 Black has two bishops, but his majority is crippled (from an earlier ...dxc6 in the Ruy Lopez), and White's knights are reasonably centralized. Nevertheless, Black has excellent winning chances. He begins by restricting the white knight on f3 and then exchanging it: 28 ... c5! 29 lt:Jg3 lt:Jb4 30 lt:Jxh4 i.xh4 31 lt:Je4 i.e7 32 i.gl i.c6 33 i.f2 i.d7! Now the idea is to infiltrate with the king to d5 and place the bishop dynamically on f5, to

tie down White's pieces. Then the queenside pawns will advance. 34 i.g3 �d5 35 lDf2 h5 36 �f3 i.f5 37 Re3 b5 38 �f3 aS 39 �e3 b4 40 �3 �c6 (D) w Heading for a4, so White has to straighten out the black pawns, after which a passed pawn escorted by bishops will decide in the conven tional manner: 41 axb4 cxb4 42 cxb4 axb4 43 ltJe4 'it>d5 44 .!iJd6 i.xc16 45 exd6 c3 46 bxc3 b3 0-1 Finally, Nimzowitsch gives this position, which is of particular interest because others have also used it (or something extremely simi lar) to explain how knights like closed posi tions: Nimzowitsch introduces this section of the chapter by saying "We have now done enough for the glorification of the bishops, and a few words may be added on situations in which they do not cut such a good figure." Of the diagram, he merely says that 'even' in that situation, "it seems to me that Black can maintain himself against the Horwitz bishops." The idea is that Black' s ...f6! is supposed to be a big improve ment on a position with ...f5, which would al low the bishops free scope. Well, I'm not going to do any complex analysis of this position, but I'd wager that most modern GMs would jump at the chance to be White here. He has several ways to make progress, for example, �h l fol lowed by .l:.g l and then g4-g5. Also queenside expansion to drive back the knight looks prom ising. After b4, assuming that Black can defend his queenside against a well-timed c5 or piece infiltration after b5, White can always play b5 and kick the knight, in order to be free to play f5 (without allowing ... .!iJe5), followed by g4-g5 to attack the kingside. One reason I bring this up is to emphasize a theme of Part 2: when one has the knight-pair versus two bishops, trying to wait around in a semi-closed position with out knight outposts is almost always hopeless. Modern practice shows that, more often than not, some kind of dynamic opening of the posi tion is necessary to fight effectively against the bishops, and it's obviously too late to do that in the diagramm ed position. Well, I have a stack of books in front of me with standard examples of unassailable knights on wonderful outposts versus miserably immo bile bishops, as well as of devastating bishops versus prospectless knights or bad bishops. To illustrate classical theory, we will look at a few of these. But I have to say that Suba's objection to instructional and middlegame books, that they show only the art of playing against weak opposition, could hardly be more true with re gards to their treatment of minor pieces. The reader interested in more exciting examples and a broader view might want to turn immedi ately to Chapters 4-8 of Part 2. Also, I should note that a recent book, Steve Mayer's Bishop versus Knight: The Verdict, is a marvellous ex ception to this trend, especially in the way that he gives groundbreaking attention to 'overrated knights' , 'overrated bishops' , to the many ex amples of 'bad' bishops which are strong, and to the misunderstood relation of the minor pieces to open and closed positions. But to return to this chapter, let's look at some classically good knights. Romanovsky
68 SECRETS OF MODERN CHESS STRATEGY
devotes many examples to knight monsters which dominate the board, for example: w Levenfish - Dubinin Leningrad 1934 As so often in these textbook examples, the knight on d5 is not only a killer, but just to rub it in, Black's bishop is classically 'bad' and his d-pawn is backward and on an open file. Here's how White converts: 20 l:.fe1 I:.e6 21 lDf4 I:.xe1+ 22 I:.xe1 .Ba5 23 lDd5! .idS 24 h4 l:.b7 25 c4 rJiff7 26 'i#'f3 'it.og8 27 ir'e2 g6 28 h5 'it.of8 29 h6 .Bg5 30 ir'b2 'it.og8 31 f4 .idS 32 lDf6+ .Bxf6 33 ir'xf6 d5 34 cxd5 1-0 His other examples are even more one-sided. By contrast, the following one, from Pachman, at least includes some subtle points: Ahues - Alekhine Bad Nauheim 1936 Black is better here, since his pawn on e4 cramps White and White's bishop on d2 is par ticularly bad. One might expect a move such as 15 ...g6, restricting the g3-knight and preparing to attack by ...h5-h4. But Alekhine's solution is classically elegant: 15 ... .Bxg3! 16 hxg3 lDe7! This knight is heading for the unassailable d5-square, whereas White's bishop looks worse than ever on d2. So in a sense, this is just a case of superior minor pieces. But 15 ... .Bxg3 has two other functions: a) it releases potential pressure on e4 from the g3-knight, which matters if White plays f3. It is the e4-pawn which keeps the d2-bishop im prisoned; b) White's pawn structure after hxg3 is par ticularly vulnerable to attack, as the rest of the game shows.

This prevents White's idea of getting his knight to e5 via c4. 20 axb5 axb5 21 'i#'e2 c6 22 lDc2 'i#'f5 23 I:.fcl h6 24 l:.a5 I:.acS 25 lDa1? lDg4 (D) Suddenly ... 'it'h5 and ... I:.e6-f6 just wins.

For the sake of filling in our picture of traditional minor-piece theory, let's look at a classic example of how the bishop can beat the knight in a simplified open position:
MINOR-PIECE ISSUES 69
w Najdorf - StAhlberg Candidates tournament, Zurich 1953 This makes a good example, because Black has no weaknesses and White does: his doubled f-pawns and isolated h-pawn. So, as opposed to those pure bishop-versus-knight endings with pawns on both sides of the board (the side with the bishop tends to win almost all of those), this one is not necessarily winning for the first player at all. But the game more realistically il lustrates just how difficult Black's defence is, and may make clear why the mere possession of a bishop versus a knight in the ending tends to be so large an advantage:

h6 30 .i::. h5 Now White is done loosening up Black's pawn structure for the moment. Pachman criti cizes Black's 28th and makes a very perceptive comment: "Generally, the pawns should be placed on squares of opposite colour to the bishop but ... the move ...f6 actually increases the range and power of the bishop ..." In fact, that 'rule' about putting pawns on squares of colour opposite to the bishop, repeated in most instructional books, should be relegated to the scrap heap, in my opinion. There are simply way too many exceptions, and a player is much better off reasoning for himself what the best defensive set-up is. 30 ... lt:Jc7 31 f4 �e7 32 I:.c5 .i::. d6 33 .i::. cl? b6?

The classical view that the bishop is better than the knight with pawns on both sides of the board (which is the normal
70 SECRETS OF MODERN CHESS STRATEGY
case) is just as true today. This to a large extent accounts for the extremes of hardship players will undergo in order to hang on to their bish ops. Opposite Colours Attract? The theory of opposite-coloured bishops hasn't changed much over the years. The endgame books show us the same clever draws with up to three-pawn deficits, and the same tricky wins in positions we would have sworn were drawn. The powers of unlike bishops in the middle game are well-known and summarized by the phrase 'opposite-coloured bishops favour the attacker' . Middlegame and instructional books cover this ground so well that it seems pointless to try to add to it. Dvoretsky, for example, has a very thorough treatment of opposite-coloured bishops in the middlegame in his Positional Play, which I highly recommend. But it does seem that there are long-term his torical changes in the attitude towards such bishops. Today's players seem to be willing to accept them more often, at an earlier stage of the game, as a positive type of imbalance. We will see many modern games in this book in which the properties of opposite-coloured bish ops contribute to a successful attack. But what about their alleged drawishness? In older books, we used to read annotations about games in which unlike bishops arose in the opening or early middlegame, with claims that, e.g., "this line tends to be drawish because of the oppo site-coloured bishops". But not only have the gods placed the middlegame before the end game, we have also seen great masters win the most innocent-looking of endings with unlike bishops. Tal had a few classic victories in oppo site-coloured bishop endings which raised eye brows, and such endings vary widely, both as to whether they can be drawn, and as to the ease with which such a draw may be obtained. Fur thermore, we are now aware that the distance is very large indeed between early-arising oppo site-coloured bishops and endings which are in fact drawn due to their presence. So, overall, I would suggest that very few of today's players wishing to draw put their faith in the acquisition of unlike bishops in the opening or early middlegame stage. The exceptions to that generality are quite interesting, however; they show how players can be attracted to unlike bishops in their open ing preparation for the purpose of 'at worst' getting a draw with Black. Two such openings come to mind which regularly produce oppo site-coloured bishops: the Sveshnikov Sicilian and the 6 ...c5 gambit against the Siimisch Vari ation of the King's Indian. Kramnik is a master of the Sveshnikov with Black, and regularly en ters into positions with unlike bishops which are sometimes inferior, but which he knows that he can draw, for example: Svidler - Kramnik Tilburg 1997

What is remarkable here is the degree of preparation which allows Black to enter into such lines without falling victim to a classic domination from the d5 outpost, for example, or to some other attack based upon Black's light-square weaknesses. It's also characteristic of the depth of modern openings that Kramnik undoubtedly knew which of these endgame sit uations were safely drawn. On the other hand, there's always the danger that the ending won 't be drawn: ironically, Kramnik himself recently lost one of the most important games of his young career in an opposite-coloured bishop ending (to Shirov in game 4 of their WCC qual ification match). The following game illustrates another open ing in which the unlike bishops play an impor tant role, with Kramnik as White this time: Kramnik - Shirov Bundesliga 199213

Thus, the modem player will sometimes still rely upon the drawing powers of opposite coloured bishops, but primarily in situations in which the precise nature of the resulting ending can be foreseen. Otherwise, the renowned at tacking properties of those bishops in the middlegame, as well as the unreliable nature of many endings with them, do not allow one to depend upon the unlike bishops' allegedly drawish nature. Folklore or Reality? Queens and Knights There are some old arguments about minor pieces which I want to address in this book in the light of modem experience. In Part 2 (Chap ter 4 ), I will attempt to draw some definitive conclusions about the long-standing dispute re garding the value of the two bishops. Here I
72 SECRETS OF MODERN CHESS STRATEGY
would like to examine what might be called a received bit of conventional wisdom. Mayer calls it 'Capablanca' s Theorem' : that the queen and knight tend to be better than the queen and bishop in the ending. This is an almost univer sal belief; Jeremy Silman even extends its ap plication beyond the endgame to proclaim what he calls "a little rule", that "In general, a Queen and Knight is a better combination of pieces than a Queen and Bishop" (his italics). And this seems to be part of the general consciousness. Several books mention it, and some of my stu dents have stated it to me as if it were just com mon knowledge. As for top players, here's an example: lvanchuk - Shirov Belgrade 1997 Shirov comments: "Black's pieces are a little better than White's (knight versus bishop with heavy pieces on the board) ... ". Apparently, he assumes that the material imbalance expressed in the parentheses generally constitutes an ad vantage. As further evidence for the leanings of stronger players, the statistical analyses I have done (see below) shows that the side choosing 'ir'+lt:J consistently out-rates the side with 'ir'+i.. It does so by only about 20-30 points in general, but by 60 points when considering decisive re sults. These figures apply regardless of colour, and they are true of various databases and thou sands of games, so they at least indicate a statis tically significant tendency by stronger players to go in for the 'ir'+lt:J combination more often than for 'ir'+i., presumably having some preju dice for the former. The interesting thing is how little discussion and how few good examples there are to illus trate this alleged advantage of the queen and knight pairing. In Shirov's game, for example, his king was safer than Ivanchuk's and he had an outside passed pawn whereas his opponent had immobile doubled pawns. The game was drawn anyway. And Silman's comment above came in this position, where the 'ir'+i. side had a classically lost game: Aside from White's weak and doubled pawns, his bishop is about as bad as it gets. In fact, it seems hard to come up with good illustrative positions for the 'ii' +lt:J, at least ones that are fairly neutral in their starting point. Steve Mayer, to his credit, devotes a whole chapter of his book to this debate, giving exam ples favourable to both sides. However, to dem onstrate the superiority of queen and knight, he adduces only the following examples: a) a locked position in which the bishop is simply bad; b) a position where the minute this imbal ance arises, the side with the bishop is already subject to a decisive king-hunt; c) a position in which the bishop is com pletely hemmed in, and there are numerous kingside weaknesses in addition; d) a position with a bad bishop, exposed king, and four isolated pawns; and finally, e) a position with four pawns apiece on the same side of the board. This is the fairest exam ple, except that the side with the bishop has one very weak pawn which inevitably falls. In other words, the side with the queen and knight had major pre-existing advantages in
MINOR-PIECE ISSUES 73
every case. Mayer then shows the other side of the coin with three positions in which the bishop is dominant (all of them with equally biased starting points). He concludes his exam ination with this 'Verdict' : "Capablanca' s intu itive insight into the advantage of queen and knight vs queen and bishop in the ending is cor rect." But his own examples don't seem to sup port such a conclusion. My own view, just from looking at a lot of examples, is as follows: a) an unusually large proportion of'ili'+liJ vs 'iV+.i. games are drawn; b) most games which are won by either side, as in the examples mentioned above, are char acterized by that side having one or more rather obvious other advantages. In general, 'iV+liJ vs 'ii' +.i. positions are very volatile, and often the winning side is simply the one who starts out by being able to win ma terial or launch an attack on the opposing king. Not surprisingly, the knight tends to win in closed positions against a bad bishop, or if the oppos ing king is exposed, for example. Having all the pawns oil one side of the board also favours the knight, of course, but it takes something else like a very poor enemy pawn structure for this to be enough to win. And just as predictably, the bishop tends to win when there are pawns on both sides of the board, and particularly if the knight has no natural outposts. But here, too, having the bishop alone is not enough to win the game without some extra advantages. Pach man, for example, gives these two examples: Mohrlock - Gerusel Note that aside from having pawns on both sides of the board, White's queen position is much better, and Black's knight is already re stricted. That's enough for a pretty easy win.

What, if any, conclusions can we draw? The natural thing to do is conduct some statistical searches. I have done so on several huge data bases. The first interesting point is that the winning percentages are almost the same re gardless of colour, favouring White by only about 2%. In other words, by the time 'ii' +ltJ vs it'+i. arises, White's residual advantage has al most disappeared. The second point is that there are a lot of draws: almost exactly 50% of the games, as opposed to the 30% drawing rate for all games today. In half the positions, it seems, neither side has a significant enough ad vantage to convert. With these factors in mind, let's see what the figures say. In straight-up endings with 'ihlb vs 'ii' +i., the side with the knight indeed scores over 50%, but only 53.5% overall, which hardly indicates a major advantage. Colours have al most no effect on this case. Now let's add a rook for both sides (i.e., 'ii' +ltJ+l:t vs 'ili'+i.+l:t.). That results in a virtual toss-up, although now colours again come into play. When the side with knight has White, he scores 52% overall, and when the side with the bishop has White, he scores 53%. Add another rook to both sides ('ii' +ltJ+2l':. vs 'ii +i.+2l':.), and when the side with the knight has White, he scores 53%, but when White has the bishop, he scores 55%. The obvious conclusion that one might draw from these figures is that 'ii' +ltJ seems to have a rather small edge vs 'ili'+i. in the ending, but no advantage (or even a small disadvantage) when you add 1 or 2 rooks. But I should warn that a pure statistical look may say as much about practical play as it does about theoretical supe riority. One proviso I have already noted above is that the side with the queen and knight (in the pure 'ili'+ltJ vs 'ii' +i. case) tended to be a bit stronger, for whatever reason. That alone might account for the small statistical edge for the 'ili'+lb. Moreover, as explained in the Introduc tion to this book, a perception of the superiority of queen and knight may well lead players who are in already advantageous but complex posi tions to convert them into what they view as a safer 'ii' +ltJ vs 'ili'+i. advantage. This would skew the percentages in favour of the 'iii'+lb. Also revealing is a look at the types of posi tions that are leading to wins, whether for the side with the knight or with the bishop. I de scribed these in general terms above, but there is another important phenomenon which a hands-on investigation reveals: a significant percentage of these games are decided by a blunder by one side or the other. This reflects both the volatile nature of the imbalance and the influence of time pressure (many of these endings first arise between moves 30 and 40!). The reader can only verify this theory for him self, but my impression is that at least some of the 3% of games by which the 'ii' +ltJ leads the "iV+i. might be due to the fact that knights cre ate more tactical threats in time-trouble than bishops ! If that's true, there may be a practical reason to (very slightly) prefer the 'ii' +lb in such endings, but no theoretical advantage whatsoever. When this and the considerations in the last paragraph are taken into account, the idea of the advantage of queen and knight over queen and bishop seems to be one of those folk loric bits of wisdom/mythology of at most ex tremely limited validity, and, quite possibly, of none whatsoever. This chapter has presented a broad overview of traditional ideas about the minor pieces. Its main purpose has been to provide a backdrop against which the unconventional discoveries of Part 2 may be set. Of course, although I prob ably devote more attention in this book to mi nor-piece subjects than anything else, it is still impossible to do justice to them all. My com promise solution has been to emphasize the ar eas which have changed through the years. For an in-depth discussion of those changes, I refer the reader to Part 2, Chapters 4-8.
7 Those Radical Rooks
Rooks are seldom accorded special treatment in our instructional books. Usually, these works devote their attention to the value of taking over open files and getting to the seventh rank, which indeed are the most effective things we can do with rooks under normal circumstances. In this chapter, I want to expand this discussion to rook play along the other ranks. This is a rather neglected topic, one which fits in with our notion of conceptual evolution, as opposed to fundamental theoretical change. At the end of the chapter, I take a statistical look at the in famous drawishness of rook and pawn endings. I should also direct the reader's attention to two significant rook topics which are left for Part 2. The sacrifice of the exchange has its own chap ter there, and Nimzowitsch's 'mysterious rook move' is incorporated into the discussion of prophylaxis. Seventh and Eighth Ranks In keeping with our intention to consult Nimzowitsch on most issues, we should start with his words on the seventh and eighth ranks. Surprisingly, he has been credited with being the first to explicitly identify the seventh-rank rook as an element of strategy, although natu rally his contemporaries were well aware of the power of such a rook. According to Nimzo witsch, "the entry into enemy territory, in other words into the seventh and eighth ranks, forms the logical consequence of play in a file". He adds that "in the normal course of events, it will only be late, when we pass into the endgame stage, that the seventh rank will be seized ... and this despite the fact that numerous games are decided by operations in these ranks in the mid dle game." This certainly corresponds with our modern experience; middlegame attacks based upon the seventh rank definitely occur, but they are far outnumbered by that use of rooks in the endgame. Nimzowitsch goes on to define five 'special cases' of the seventh rank, including a seventh-rank rook escorting in passed pawns, seventh-rank rooks 'marauding' to capture pawns, and 'combined play' on the seventh and eighth ranks (whereby mate threats are used to garner more material). To this day, the exam ples he unearthed and constructed are still used in our books. We know from experience that a rook on the seventh rank is typically worth at least a pawn in the endgame, whereas rooks doubled on the seventh rank will often win out right or, as Nimzowitsch himself pointed out, force a draw by perpetual check in an otherwise hopeless position. Because of the overexposure of this topic, I won't try to add anything to it here. Rooks Who Roam on Ranks But what about the other ranks? I think a strong case can be made that modern chess-players are more apt to embark upon rook adventures than their predecessors, although this still doesn't constitute a major part of the game. The reader may already be aware that rooks are often used on the second rank for defensive purposes. For example, in openings with kingside fianchettoes like the King's Indian or the Sicilian Dragon, an attack by h4-h5-hxg6 can often be met by .. .fxg6, when the move ... l:tf7 will then neutral ize many attacks by defending h7 and g7. I don't feel the need to expand upon that case, since it is fairly self-explanatory. Instead, what I want to examine here are rooks which roam beyond the second rank. Since rooks on ad vanced ranks tend to be rather awkwardly placed and exposed to attack, this is a subject which doesn't get much attention, but strong players throughout the years have used rook lifts to shift the balance of games in their fa vour. Let's look at some examples. The third rank tends to be used for attacking purposes. This is an accepted and fairly normal part of the game, so I'll just show a few posi tions which illustrate the technique. To begin with, here's an exclusively tactical example:

Later, Speelman decided that 12 h5 ! was a good idea. I will not append most of his copious notes for this game.

Another stunning page and a half devoted to 24 ... .l:i.xe6 !, although White seems ultimately to win in that case as well. I mention these typical Speelman analyses because they are both typi cal of his deranged perfectionism and wonder ful fun to play over! Fortunately, both for Jon's sanity and for us, the rest of the game is actually comprehensible on a fairly superficial level. 25 'it>cl! ltJg6 26 �c3! �c6 27 �xc6 .txc6 28 hxg7 + 'it>g8 29 .Bxg6 .l:i.fi + 30 'Oftc2 .l:i.f2+ 31 �b3 .l:i.xb2+ 32 'itxb2 hxg6 33 .l:i.fi 'itxg7 34 .l:i.t7+ 'it>g8 35 .l:i.bh7 .l:te8 36 .l:i.fg7+ 'itf8 37 e7+ 1-0 Sometimes the same third rank is used for defensive purposes. Soltis points out this inter esting case of Spassky's dual use of the same defensive-rook idea: Tal - Spassky Candidates match (game 1 1), Tbilisi 1965 This was the second time Spassky had reached this fairly nondescript position as Black. 15 b4?! In Medina Garcia-Spassky, Interzonal tour nament, Gothenburg 1955, White played 15 tt:'lh2?! d5 16 'i!Vf3 g6 17 i..g5 .Be7 1 8 h4, and here Spassky used the third-rank defence idea to good effect: 1 8. .. a5 ! 19 h5 .l:i.a6! with an ex cellent game. White had no more attacking chances and eventually lost. The text-move is too loosening; perhaps just 15 .Bg5 was best. 15 ... tt:'lcd7 16 i..b3 aS 17 a3 axb4 18 cxb4 h6 19 tt:'lf5 Introducing a classic case of kingside attack versus central expansion. 19 ... d5! 20 ltJ3h4 c5! 21 .l:te3 c4 22 .l:i.g3 This looks scary, especially when your op ponent is Tal !

Then Black discovered the pragmatic
10. ..a5 ! 1 1 j.b2 lta6, and the rook swings over
to the kingside to create threats, e.g., 12 li:)a4 j.f8 1 3 f4 ltd6 14 'ifc2 li:)c6 15 ltf3 lth6 16 J:ld1 d6 17 li:)c3 'ifh4 18 h3 l:tg6 with a serious attack, Zsu.Polgar-de la Villa, New York 1989. Such third-rank transfers might not look that odd, but on the fourth rank, a rook certainly appears awkward and subject to attack. Never theless, rooks on the fourth rank can be very ef fective in probing the enemy position, and this idea finds increasing application in modem opening theory. Normally, when rooks are transferred via the fourth rank it is for attacking purposes, but they can also serve positional functions. Let's begin with a case of sustained attack: Petrosian - Taimanov USSR Ch, Moscow 1955 In this rather innocent-looking position, Petrosian decides upon a very aggressive plan:
14 J:lad1! exd4 15 j.b7+! �h8 16 l:txd4
The point; this is one of those cases in which a fourth-rank rook wreaks havoc both in the centre and on the kingside. Notice that 15 ltxd4 would have been met by 15. .. li:)f6 ! , whereas now 16 ... li:)f6?? 17 c5 li:)xh7 18 ltxd6 followed by 19 ltxh6 wins.

On 22 ... i.xh2 23 �c2 lDe5, Dvoretsky suggests the beautiful prophylactic move 24 l:tg5 ! !, threatening lthl or lth5, and preventing 24 .. .'ii'f6? due to 25 i.g7. 23 h4! 'ii' f5 24 l:tb4!

Seven of White's last nine moves have been with this rook, and the other two by a flank pawn - all with White's king stuck in the cen tre!

The frequency of the idea .. J:lc8-c5 has led to the comical situation that White actually en gages in his own prophylaxis to prevent it! Consider (from the diagram) the game Kram nik-Karpov, Amber blindfold, Monaco 1 994: 8 ... d6 9 i.e3 !? (already thinking about ... .l:.c5) 9 ... tbbd7 1 0 .l:.ac 1 l:lc8 1 1 .l:.fd 1 O-O 12 'ifh4 l:le8 1 3 b3 a6 14 i.h3 .l:.c7 1 5 i.h6 l:.c5 (any way !

Naturally, rooks are transferred along other ranks as well, but it's difficult to make system atic comments about those situations. The sixth-rank rook often attacks weak pawns in a way similar to the seventh-rank rook. Botvinnik - Euwe World Ch match-tournament, Moscow 1948 White is clearly better, but his technique is worth noting: 24 .l:.d6!

The sixth-rank rook oper ated very much like one on the seventh rank, even in its eventual sacrifice. In concluding this section, I should point out that the value of such rook-lifts is not based upon general principles, but upon the concrete factors of each individual position. For exam ple, in the main line of the g3 variation of the King's Indian Defence, 1 d4 tt'lf6 2 c4 d6 3 tt'lc3 g6 4 g3 .tg7 5 tt'lf3 O-O 6 i.g2 tt'lbd7 7 O-O e5 8 e4 exd4 9 tt'lxd4 l:.e8 10 h3 (D), Black has tried out a number of ideas involving ... l:.e5-h5, to try to force weaknesses in White's kingside.
B
After a few years of attempts, however, this idea has virtually disappeared, because White's extra moves on the kingside ended up being useful ones, and the rook tended to look a bit stupid, e.g., 10. ..a6 (or 10 ... tt'lc5 1 1 l%e1 i.d7
12 b3 'ili'c8?! 13 <j;h2 l:.e5?! 14 f4 l%h5 15 f5 !,
which turned out clearly to White's advantage in Vul-Dochev, Russia 1993) 1 1 i.e3 l:.b8 12 a4 tt'lc5 13 'ili'c2 a5 14 l:.ad1 .td7 15 l:.fe1 'iir' c8 16 <j;h2 l:.e5 ! ? 17 f3 l:.h5 18 h4 h6 19 <j;g 1 ! l:.e5 (the rook has no more point on h5) 20 tt'lde2 b6 21 i..d4 with a modest but definite ad vantage, Itkis-Borge, Erevan Olympiad 1996. In modern chess, the efficacy of such ideas is ultimately decided by the rigorous tests of prac tice. One might contrast this with the famous game Tarrasch-Lasker, World Ch match (game 4), Dusseldorf 1908, in which Lasker played . .. lle5-c5 at one point, seemingly dooming his rook to extinction but achieving a brilliant counterattack in the process. For many years, this game was uncritically reproduced to illus trate Lasker' s great genius (which indeed it does); but as Dvoretsky has shown, Tarrasch only had to play slightly better to retain a large advantage, and not just at one point, but even after having made mistakes. I don't believe that Lasker's risk-taking style, at least in the precise form it was applied in this game, would fare very well today. On the other hand, rook-lifts to the fourth rank are sometimes perfectly sound, and seem to have gained a small but permanent place in contemporary chess. Drawish Endings? By legend, it was Tarrasch who first said that all rook and pawn endings are drawn. I hesitate even to comment upon this subject, because the kernel of truth in it is so clear to anyone who has ever studied ll+,0, vs : endings. There are many ways for the defender to frustrate the side with the extra pawn. Nevertheless, this is one of those folkloric 'rules', and the reader may find it interesting to see what a database search re veals. I have looked at three cases: a) rook and extra pawn versus rook (i.e., with any number of total pawns); b) rook and single extra pawn versus rook; and as a control, c) various combinations of other pieces and an extra pawn or a lone pawn versus the same combination of pieces (e.g., simple things like i-+,0, vs i..to complex ones like 'iii' , .t, 2tt'l + 4,0, vs 'if, i..,2tt'l + 3,0,). Unfortunately, there is no way to be 'fair' about the way that these endings are chosen. But right off, it is interesting to look at case 'a'
82 SECRETS OF MODERN CHESS STRATEGY
when its conditions are only required to last for one ply (half a move) versus that case when its conditions last for at least 1 0 ply (5 full moves). Since there is a slight (2%) difference in the re sults depending upon which colour has the ex tra pawn (i.e., White retains a tiny residual advantage), I will give only the results with White having the material advantage. The side with the rook and extra pawn wins 46%, draws 44%, and loses 1 0% of the time when only re quired to be on the board for 1 ply, but those figures go to winning 57%, drawing 39%, and losing 4% of the time when the rook and extra pawn last for at least 1 0 ply. These last figures are probably of more interest to the theoreti cian, since they represent a more stable condi tion, so for all other results I have used the 1 0-ply criterion. What about case 'b' , with a single, extra pawn? Then the extra pawn wins 50% of the time, and draws 50% of the time, regardless of colour. This case is probably the one Tarrasch was referring to. Finally, we have case 'c' as a control. This is supposed to include all other pawn-up endings without rooks. Interestingly, the figures parallel the basic pawn-up rook endings rather closely: the side with the extra pawn wins 59%, draws 37%, and loses 4% (again using figures for White with the extra material; there's about a 3% residual bias for White). Certain break downs are also revealing: bishop and extra pawn vs bishop wins 52% of the time and draws 46%; knight and extra pawn vs knight wins 67% of the time and draws 3 1 %; and queen and extra pawn vs queen wins 54% or the time and draws 42%. When we move on to the piece plus single pawn vs piece endings, we have the bishop drawing 55% of the time, the knight drawing 61%, and the queen drawing 53%. What does all this mean? First of all, these kinds of searches are inherently rather loose, as one can quickly confmn by looking at the spe cific games which survive the filter. There are numerous fluky and unusual positions, so it's not clear how significant the numbers I've re ported are. But if we can draw any tentative conclusions, it would be that having an extra pawn in a rook and pawn ending with multiple pawns is apparently no more drawish than hav ing an extra pawn in a random non-rook end ing. As for the simplest case, rook and one pawn versus rook, that draws about half the time, which is actually less drawish than other individual pieces with a lone extra pawn. So, at least compared to other analogous endings, rook endings are not particularly drawish. An other truism bites the dust?
8 Royalty in Our Times
What's it like to be a king? Not much fun, at least in chess. One spends most of one's life hiding in fear, far from the fray, while even your queen gets to go out and slay the foe, bedecking herself in glory. About the only exercise you get is shuffling away, turtle-like, when the enemy forces get too close. The nineteenth-century chess king was more adventurous, to be sure, but only in a suicidal sense. After a while, Tarrasch or some other court advisor convinced such reckless monarchs to pursue a comfort able life back in the castle, and only to enter the battlefield when the queen and most of the other officers were safely dead. At that point, the king could boldly step forth for the noble purposes of tax collection, and, of course, in or der to cultivate a new consort from the ranks of the peasantry. Is the modern king any different? For the most part, no; king safety is still the primary concern in the vast majority of middlegames. But things are a little less dogmatic than in the latter-nineteenth and early-twentieth century when, as Soltis says, "Morphy and his imitators always castled quickly." For one thing, there are quite a few openings in which a king stays in the centre (see Karpov's recent treatment of the Caro-Kann Defence, for example). And ever since Nimzowitsch's time, there have been cer tain players who seemed to revel in finding sur prising roles for the king, sometimes avoiding castling to better coordinate their forces, at other times even marching forward to support the troops. Kaidanov says of such players that they have 'a feel for the king'. The N imzo-Kingdian Defence Perhaps the first player with such a feel was Nimzowitsch himself. He once said "I love to take my king for promenades", and indeed, he had that knack for recognizing positions in which the best plan available was to vacate the palace for a trip to the country villa. Keene, who collected examples of such promenades by Nimzowitsch, categorized the motives for king walks as follows: (a) provocation; (b) pre emptive defence (running away from a threat ened wing); (c) "a portent of aggressive action on the vacated wing itself'. I will apply these categories, which sometimes overlap, to the ex amples which follow. Let' s begin with an ex ample from the promenader himself:
B
Alekhine - Nimzowitsch St Petersburg 1914 Things are not looking very promising for Black; in fact, White seems to be on the verge of complete domination. At this point, Nimzo witsch notices an interesting feature of the po sition: it's not so much that his kingside is weak, but rather, that his king is a target there. Thus the following moves, setting up a promenade. 27 ... .l:.d8! 28 �g2 .l:.cc8 29 .l:.hl �f8! 30 .l:.h4 c,ite8! 31 'i'h6 <:i;e7 32 .l:.f4 White can't capture the h-pawn due to ... .l:.h8.

The
84 SECRETS OF MODERN CHESS STRATEGY
odd thing is that, once you see the king on the queenside, it looks absolutely safe and natural there. But as practical players, we are extremely disinclined to initiate such king-walks. As the game went, Alekhine badly overextended and exposed his position by playing h6 and g4-g5, after which Nimzowitsch was able to pressure the queenside and eventually break through by ... e5. That king march was an example of case 'b' , pre-emptive defence. Here's Nimzowitsch ap plying case 'c' , the 'portent of aggressive ac tion' : Nilsson - Nimzowitsch Exhibition game, Eskilstuna 1921

Black is clearly better (20 f5? c6). Note how well the king stands now ! The next player who became known for his king walks was the enormously imaginative Petrosian. In fact, there are too many fine ex amples from his play to choose from, so I'll just present a few showing how naturally he inte grated the king into his play: In the following position, White has an ad vantage on the queenside, but a close examina tion will show that there is no clear way to make progress. I wonder how many players would have found his simple solution:

Diez del Corral - Petrosian Palma de Mallorca 1969 Black has a major long-term advantage in view of his good knight vs bad bishop and the weak white d-pawns.

With his next move, Karpov conceives of an amazing idea: in order to retain a material and positional balance, his king will march right up the board, in spite of all the

In fact, 21 'iit' e3? was wrong. White should proba bly have bailed out with 21 'ii' g6; one feels that this would have been Karpov's choice when he was a few years older! Perhaps one needs fewer pieces on the board for a truly successful provocation. In his article on king marches, Kaidanov (who has played some nice ones himself) features this example: w Psakhis - Hebden Chicago 1983 White's position is certainly dominant-look ing; as Kaidanov points out, Black can only move his bishop ! On the other hand, how to make progress? The passed b-pawn isn't of much use when it can be blockaded so easily by the dark-squared bishop. The answer: a king promenade, of course! But where is it heading? 42 'it>g2 �b6 43 cj;;fl �a7 44 �e2 �b6 45 �d3 �a7 46 �c4 Rc7+ 47 cj;;b3 Nowhere? 47 ... 'i'e7 48 g4 �b6 49 cj;; c4! �a7 50 cj;;b5! ! Somewhere! 50 ...

So the king gets to have a little fun, after all. Of course, exotic king marches of the type shown here will always be exceptional. Those interested in king play might also want to keep an eye on the increasing number of opening lines in which the monarch remains in the cen tre. Typically, this arises because one wishes to achieve a particular goal (e.g., a freeing pawn move or ideal piece development) and can't af ford the tempo needed for castling. Certain structures lend themselves to this idea, e.g., black pawns on f7, e6, and either d5, as in the French, or c6, as in the Scandinavian, Caro Kann, and Slav Defences. In all four of these openings, moves such as ... 'iii> f8, ... cj;>e?, and ... cj;>d? are becoming part of established theory. Of course, one will also find mainstream open ings in which White forfeits castling for strate gic reasons. To sum up: modern players attend to king safety as assiduously as their predecessors did, but there seems to be a bit more room for cre ative king play today, a trend I would expect to continue.
9 Assorted Topics
We conclude Part 1 by looking at a few topics that Nimzowitsch addressed, but which don't fit in elsewhere. Needless to say, there are areas w of traditional theory which we haven't touched upon, and still others which will be examined in the next Part, but only by contrast with a con siderably different modern point of view. The first two subjects which follow are character- ized by their smooth transition from classical to modern play, and the last one has practically disappeared from chess theory. Manoeuvring and Weaknesses Nimzowitsch devotes the last chapter of My System to 'manoeuvring against weaknesses' , a process he characterizes more as a matter of technique and patience than as a theoretical procedure. But the part of his discussion which interests me concerns the idea of "combined play on both wings, with weaknesses which, though for the moment wanting, are yet hid den". He gives a rather too complicated exam ple of this in which, by means of zugzwang, his opponent was forced to create a second, ex ploitable weakness. In his own words, "play on two wings is usually based on the following idea. We engage one wing or the obvious weak nesses on it, and thus draw the other enemy wing out of its reserve, when new weaknesses will be created on that reserve wing, and so the signal is given for systematic manoeuvring against two weaknesses." In our times, the Dvoretsky school has strongly emphasized this idea of needing to have play against two weaknesses in order to be able to win. I have heard jokes by grandmaster students of Dvoretsky about the 'four-weakness rule' and the 'no-weakness' rule and so forth, poking fun at the slightly rigid nature of such constructions. But Kosikov quotes this instruc tive example (D): Shirov comments: "One weakness, the b7- pawn, has been securely fixed ... But as a child I learned that for victory I will need at least one Shirov - Kinsman Paris 1992 more weakness. And it turns out to be the g7- pawn."
30 h4 gxh4 31 gxh4 j_f7 32 e5!
Shirov: "The point of my idea. When White begins to attack g7, the b7 -pawn will no longer be in need of defence - which means the e6- pawn should be another weakness." 32 ...f5? Kosikov: "This significantly eases White's task. 32 ...fxe5 33 dxe5 �f8 would have been stronger, but here as well after 34 l:tg2 Black's position remains difficult, for example, 34 .. Jle7 35 l:.d l ! i.g8 36 l:tgd2 �e8 37 �f4 and then �g5 and f3-f4-f5 with an easy win." 33 l:.g2 g6 34 l:.bg1 l:tc8 35 l:r.xg6! f4+ 36 �d3 l:tcd8 37 l:tf6 l:.xd4+ 38 <li'c3 l:td1 39 l:tg7 l:.cl+ 40 <li'b3 l:r.b1+ 41 �c2 1-0 So in the end, this turned into a 'three weakness' case (b7, g7, and e6). But some form of 'two-weakness' rule is almost a given in to day's theoretical landscape, and Nimzowitsch's original concept remains useful. Pachman gen eralizes the idea of combined play on the wings (which he calls 'tacking' , presumably from the German 'lavieren' , which Nimzowitsch used) to include "every positional manoeuvre in which the enemy position is alternately subjected to tactical threats of various kinds". And indeed,
ASSORTED TOPICS 89
every master has given us examples of creating threats on one wing to destroy the coordination of the opponent's forces, and then switching suddenly to the other wing for a decisive break through. From a theoretical point of view, the exact number of weaknesses (or targets, or available tactical themes) is really not so im portant. Exchanging, Old and New Nimzowitsch lists a number of reasons for ex changing pieces, and (to discourage what he calls 'indiscriminate bartering') he even claims that "if an exchange doesn't come under one or the other of these it is bad". Briefly, his list in cludes all the classical reasons for exchanging, e.g., to seize an open file, to destroy a defender, not to lose time, and to simplify if one has ma terial superiority. None of these reasons has grown less valid, but we might want to add some modern ideas on this subject. One such idea which seems par ticularly important is exchanging to establish control of colour complexes. A simple example of this would be in the Closed Sicilian after 1 e4 c5 2 ltJc3 d6 3 g3 g6 4 .Bg2 .Bg7 5 d3 lLlc6 6 .Be3 ltb8 7 'ir'd2 b5 8 lLlf3 b4 9 lLld1 .Bg4 ! ? 10 h3 .Bxf3 1 1 .Bxf3 (D):

The exchange on f3 has enhanced Black's control of the dark squares along the a1-h8 di agonal. Smyslov-Fischer, Rovinj/Zagreb 1970 continued 1 1 ...lLlf6 12 .Bg2 O-O 13 O-O .:te8 (since the idea is dark-square control, Black saves his g7-bishop) 14 .Bh6 .i.h8 15 ltJe3 lLld7 (clearing the diagonal) 16 .:tab1, and now Fischer played the very direct 1 6. .. .:tb6 ! ? 17 lLlc4 .:ta6
18 a3 lLlb6 with strong queenside pressure.
A similar idea arises in the English Opening after 1 c4 c5 2 lLlc3 ltJc6 3 g3 g6 4 .Bg2 .Bg7 5 lLlf3 e5 6 d3 ltJge7 7 a3 O-O 8 l:tb1 a5 9 .i.g5 !?

The intention is to exchange the bishop after 9 ...h6 (on 9 ...f6, either 10 i.d2 or 1 0 i.e3 ! ? is played) 10 .Bxe7 lLlxe7 1 1 ltJd2, with a firm grip on the central light squares. Such conces sions of bishops for knights in order to gain central control have become increasingly com mon of late. Sometimes, of course, one side simply gains time and space, without the grip on a colour-complex shown in these two exam ples. It is not as though modern players ex change for radically different reasons from their predecessors, but examples like these show how the scope of desirable exchanges has expanded. Overprotection : A Few Remarks Nimzowitsch was mercilessly lampooned by Hans Kmoch in a famous article about a game 'Nimzowitsch-Sistemsson' (which was con cocted by Kmoch). Supposedly annotated by White, the notes to the game parody Nimzo witsch's annotating style, with numerous refer ences to his own profundity and sophistication, the vulgarity of other chess-players, and the like. Interestingly, Kmoch chose to satirize one of Nimzowitsch's most cherished concepts, that of overprotection. Here is the game, with

The reader is encouraged to look at any number of books for the complete article (for example, Keene's Reappraisal; see the Bibli ography). What I find interesting is that Kmoch satirizes many of Nimzowitsch's writing-style eccentricities, but only one of his chess theo ries: that of overprotection. What' s more, like the comic milking a joke, he seems to think that every mention of 'overprotection' will be good for another laugh (and isn't it?). In 1 927, this showed some real insight. As it turned out, the only element of Nimzowitsch's theoretical edi fice that was truly ignored or rejected by his successors was that of overprotection. What was this concept? Basically, that there existed key points in a position which, irrespective of how strongly they were attacked by the oppo nent, deserved protection by many of one's pieces, even if that meant using rooks on closed files or bishops on closed diagonals. In Nimzo witsch's own words, "Weak points, still more strong points, in short everything that we can include in the collective conception of strategi cally important points, ought to be overpro tected. If the pieces are so engaged, they get their reward in the fact that they will then find themselves well-posted in every respect." His own examples of this new principle tended to be in the French Defence Advance Variation (as were his examples of pawn chains). He played three variants of this after 1 e4 e6 2 d4 d5 3 e5 c5 (D); it is revealing to see how modern theory assesses them. w a) 4 c3 lLlc6 5 lLlf3 'ii' b6 6 �d3.

more than enough activity by ignoring d4 and opening lines on the kingside; b) 4 'ii' g4 cxd4 5 liJf3 lDc6 6 i.d3.

Here, although 6 ... lDge7 7 i.f4 'ii' b6 8 O-O lDg6! 9 i.g3 'ii' xb2 turns out rather well for Black, Nimzowitsch's opponents again ne glected simply 6 ...f6, when 7 'ii' e2 fxe5 8 lDxe5 lDxe5 9 'i!fxe5 'ii' f6 is known to equalize, and the consistent overprotection by 7 i.f4?! actu ally backfires after 7 ...fxe5 8 i.xe5 (8 lDxe5?

But it seems to me that the concept is flawed on two grounds: a) Regarding the weaker usage of the term, protecting critical points is just common sense, hardly a separate principle. At its best, over protection is either a form of preventing freeing moves or transferring pieces via an outpost. Used in this sense, the term is superfluous. b) When we consider 'overprotection' in the stronger sense, the idea of rendering one's own pieces passive just to focus redundantly on a single point has very few practical applications. In most positions, there are other dynamic fac tors which are of more importance (as in the French examples above), and the restricted ac tivity of the protecting pieces tends to be a seri ous drawback in practical play. For whatever reasons, it is hard to find either theoreticians or players today who employ the concept of overprotection. We have come to the end of Part 1 . The theo retical advances and reassessments we have de scribed in these first eight chapters are modest ones, and easy to assimilate. At the same time, the reader has been exposed to the essentials of the classical model. Next, we journey to the contemporary chess world in which much of that model has been rejected. It's an adventur ous trip, and occasionally disorienting; as we shall see, someone's been playing with the signposts ! But even if we get lost from time to time, I think that you'll enjoy the view. Part 2 : New Ideas and the Modern Revolution
1 Overview
In Part 1, we reviewed classical principles and discussed their extensions and revisions in modern times. Now it is time to indulge our selves by examining what is truly new and unique about chess in our era. These distin guishing features might be thrown into relief by a short excursion into the past... The Death of Chess Revisited The reader will recall that our (rather arbitrary) date of departure into 'modernity' is 1935. The main representatives of the 'hypermodern school' had already passed their peaks. And ac cording to some chess writers, they were con sidered to have been defeated by the classical school. This was based on tournaments such as New York 1 924 and New York 1927 and more importantly, by the persistence of classical players such as Lasker and Capablanca in the world championship, followed by Alekhine, who at any rate was no hypermodern. This was also the era of talk about 'the death of chess' . There are varying accounts, but the details are inessential with respect to the con cept itself. Reti's version in Modern Ideas in Chess has it that due to the large number of draws at the beginning of Capablanca's 1921 match with Lasker, Capablanca expressed the following view (quoting Reti now): "Chess technique and the knowledge of openings have progressed to such an extent today that it might, even against a weaker player, be difficult to win a game. As a remedy, he [Capablanca] pro posed a reform in chess. He suggested a change in the opening position, and as an example the interchange of the positions of rooks and bish ops. I think that perhaps Capablanca's fears are exaggerated ... But in principle, [he] was cer tainly right." Reti goes on to agree with Lasker' s suggestion that one should be able to win by eliminating the opponent' s material (along with a change in the stalemate rule). According to Irnre Konig's account, Lasker himself, after his match with Capablanca, "pre dicted that Capablanca's detailed analysis of openings would lead to the death of chess by draws. Capablanca expressed similar views af ter his defeat by Alekhine." Whoever first floated the idea of the death of chess, I find it re vealing that all three of these great players felt that chess had been essentially worked out, that something was wrong with the game, and (most amusingly) that 'detailed' opening theory was responsible for the increasing drawishness of chess. Little did they know! Perhaps the first point to make is that the 'death by draw' theory was based on some rather scanty evidence in the first place, for ex ample, two matches in which Capablanca was involved. One could argue that Capablanca played conservatively in general, and espe cially against world-class players in match situ ations. Also, all three participants in these matches employed an extremely limited open ing repertoire, which led to the same lines being repeated and little chance of either side gaining a large advantage. Furthermore, one should note that the Lasker match went only 14 games before Lasker withdrew. Apart from those considerations, was chess really getting that much more drawish? Looking at databases, one can see an apparent rise in drawishness from the period 1800-1 900 (for which I have White winning 46%, Black 36%, with 18% draws) to the period 1901- 1935
OVERVIEW 93
(44%-32%-24%), but even this 6% rise might be partially explained by a bias in the database games selected, i.e., in a relatively small selec tion of early games, there is a tendency to in clude a lot of individual wins (e.g., all Morphy's casual games), as opposed to the complete tour nament results which dominate databases with modern games. It is also interesting to compare 1890-1910 (44%-33%-24%, figures rounded), virtually indistinguishable from the 1901-1935 results. Continuing along this vein, did drawish ness indeed take over chess in the modern pe riod? We indeed see a definite rise in the 1935- 65 era to 4 1 %-28%-3 1 %; hardly a death blow to competitiveness, however. Then, interest ingly, a minuscule decline in the draw rate (and slight gain in Black's fortunes) for more recent times (post- 1965) at 40%-30%-30%, a figure that has been looking remarkably stable. So the draw threat was greatly exaggerated, and chess continues apace. Why? It is first in teresting to look at what Alekhine said, again quoting Konig: "Alekhine, however, took the opposite view, saying that the imperfection of technique was the cause of the greater number of draws. As to the over-analysis of openings, he considered that we knew very little about them." Well, yes ! In this last respect, Alekhine was simply right, and so many of his contempo raries wrong. I will separately discuss the changes and expansion of modern chess open ings towards the end of Part 2. And in general, Part 2 may be said to provide an answer to Lasker and Capablanca's arguments. A great number of factors have gone into the continued decisiveness of modern chess results, despite the greater knowledge, experience, and techni cal facility of the modern player. The chapters which follow attempt to serve as a guide to some of those factors. Perhaps paramount among them, however, is the gradual relaxation of dog matism which accompanies modern play. On the one hand, who cannot have the great est respect for the genius of a Lasker, Capa blanca, Tarrasch or Rubinstein? They were magnificent players who advanced chess enor mously and continue to captivate modern gen erations. In particular, the drama of their confrontations (being so infrequent, and in an era of so few professional players) lends a ro mance which, to many, seems missing in modem play. Nevertheless, these players (and their contemporaries) were inevitably unimagina tive and limited in several respects. Essentially, the range of positions they considered playable (or even worthy of investigation) was very nar row, and, on the grounds of 'general principles', they continually dismissed ideas and moves which we now consider natural and normal. We will discuss the movement away from such high concepts in subsequent chapters. For now, although later chapters go into a lot more detail, let's take a brief look at the attitudes of older masters just in the realm of opening the ory. First, there's simply the issue of what openings people saw fit to play. In the 1800s, anything but 1 e4 was a bit eccentric; 1 e4 e5 was played in about 64% of games, and 1 e4 with another reply (almost always a French or a Sicilian) was played in about 23%. 1 d4 d5 oc curred in about 10% of games (mainly due to an influx at the end of the century, which elicited contempt from some of the Classicists), and other answers to 1 d4 were below the noise level (less than 1 % combined). Alternatives to
1 e4 and 1 d4 (Staunton's 1 c4 notwithstanding)
were so rare as not even to be a subject of con troversy. By the period 1901- 1935, 1 d4 had become orthodox, with 1 d4 d5 grabbing 28% of the games, and other answers to 1 d4 occurring a respectable 16% of the time. 1 e4 e5 was still being played 3 1 % of the time, with other an swers to 1 e4 (still the French and the Sicilian, two-thirds of the time, with some others creep ing in) using up 20% of the game space. This leaves a surprising 5% (these numbers are rounded oft) for other first moves, as the hyper modems begin to leave their mark. The modern figures are drastically down to 14% for 1 e4 e5 (and lower among the world's top players; see the next paragraph), 35% for other replies to 1 e4 (slightly more than half of these Sicilians !), 15% for 1 d4 d5 (repeat my re mark for 1 e4 e5), and 23% for other replies to 1 d4. The 12% for other openings reflects the popularity of the English Opening more than anything else, since 1 liJf3 tends to transpose to an English or Queen's Pawn opening. Turning to top-level play (by investigating a database of lnformators), we see that 1 e4 e5 is still less common at 9.5%, and 1 d4 d5 is played
94 SECRETS OF MODERN CHESS STRATEGY
13.8% of the time. There are some very inter
esting details when we look more closely. The old Orthodox lines of the Queen's Gambit De clined (including all ... lt:Jbd7 lines like the Capablanca Variation, and throwing in the Las ker Variation just for good measure) account for less than 2% of the 1 d4 d5 games, or about a 0.25% of all games. And yet this was the vari ation which was leading to the 'death of chess' ! The fact is that even the formerly narrowly interpreted lines of 1 d4 d5 have broadened considerably in scope, especially with the pop ularity of the Slav Defence and Queen's Gam bit Accepted, whereas similar things could be said about 1 e4 e5. In his Last Lectures, for ex ample, Capablanca, for example, presents the following rather smug view of the Ruy Lopez, an opening he certainly knew a thing or two about:
1 e4 e5 2 lt:Jf3 lt:Jc6 3 .tbS a6 4 .ta4 lt:Jf6 5
O-O .te7 "The variation preferred today by a majority of masters ..." 6 l:r.e1 b5 7 .tb3 d6 8 c3 (D) 8 ... lt:Ja5 9 .tc2 c5 10 d4 "fic7 "It can be said that the opening is over. In this variation, everyone, from critics to grand masters, seems to agree that the moves of the text are the best ones. Bogoljubow, some time ago, tried to discredit the variation, castling with the black pieces on the eighth instead of the text-move ... lt:Ja5. The innovation did not enjoy great success and the masters have re turned to the old variation. "It is curious how this happens so often. The young masters want to do better than the old masters, and to prove all kinds of innovations. Sometimes the element of surprise produces good results; but with certain classical varia tions, as in the present case, the new moves are frustrated by the uncompromising defence of the old guard." Now I'm not picking on Capablanca, and there are far more egregious examples of dog matism about openings (see below); but even here, in a very conservative position which was extremely familiar to him (and by no means prone to tactical explosions, as so many modern openings are), he fails to have an appreciation for the possibilities of the game. And this is the crux of the matter: the old masters had an atti tude that chess was strictly limited and regu lated by a set of principles, and were blind to the flexibility that modern play has revealed. They were extraordinarily quick to condemn anything that 'looked' unusual to them, or even something which, however logical (e.g., Bogol jubow's 8 ... O-O idea!), hadn't caught on or had lost one well-known game. Nimzowitsch's win as White over Marshall's Modern Benoni, for example, practically eliminated the opening for a few decades, despite the use of a variation subsequently shown to be harmless to Black. In the case before us, of course, 8 ... O-O went on to become the main line (in fact, it was prob ably already the most important move by the end of Capablanca's career). One could argue that this is a technical and not a strategic point (although by avoiding h3 in Capablanca's move-order, White gains time to consolidate his centre, a really serious issue which has eliminated 8 ... lt:Ja5 from normal practice). But beyond the move-order, the fact that ... lt:Ja5 and ... c5 is not Black's only strategy (despite "ev eryone's" agreement), has been shown by the wide variety of alternative plans later adopted in this variation. Just for example, a database of lnformators (including 37-69) reveals that out of approximately 800 games beginning with the 8 c3 O-O( !) 9 h3 position, there are indeed 1 89 games with the traditional 9 ... lt:Ja5 10 .tc2 c5 1 1 d4. However, there are also 1 23 games with Breyer' s move 9 ... lt:Jb8, 228 games with ... .tb7 and ... l:r.e8 on the 9th and lOth moves, 60 games with 9 . . .h6, 73 games with 9 ... lt:Jd7, 39 games with 9 ... .te6, and even some interesting
OVERVIEW 95
experiments such as the 1 1 games featuring 9 ...a5 !?. And how many games are there with the 8 ... lZJa5 line given as best by Capablanca? Pre cisely 1 , by that great reviver of historical lines, Bent Larsen. TWIC (a database of recent games) also contained only 1 such game (out of about 700 in this variation), won by White in classical style by avoiding h3. The real point is that stra tegic flexibility and openness to new ideas is characteristic of modern chess. It turns out that experimentation has much more going for it than just the 'element of surprise' . Of course, I could also quote enormous in creases in the use of openings such as the Pirc, Modern, Alekhine's, Caro-Kann, King's In dian, Nimzo-Indian, Benoni, and many others. But it's not only a matter of which openings the old masters picked; it's also how narrowly they were interpreted. One need only look at the to day's Sicilian or King's Indian (or Grtinfeld or Caro- Kann - or almost any modern opening, for that matter) to see how strategies have di versified into utterly unique paths and sub variations which are so different in character as to be almost separate openings. The main point, which we will also pursue in the next chapter with reference to areas beyond the opening, is that even the greatest of the old masters were limited by a powerful dogmatism based on general principles they supposed to be true. A good reference which reveals some of these attitudes is Raymond Keene's The Evolu tion of Chess Opening Theory. I will close this chapter with a few examples from his book, and cite some similar cases I have found elsewhere. The narrow distribution of opening varia tions before 1935 (outlined above) had its source in traditional closed-mindedness towards new ideas. Tarrasch, whose works were enormously influential, has recently been the subject of some revisionist denial regarding the dogma tism Nimzowitsch accused him of. But, despite his brilliant writing and undoubted contribu tions to the game, even a casual look through Tarrasch's Dreihundert Schachpartien vindi cates Nimzowitsch. Tarrasch stated, for exam ple, that " l ...e5 is, theoretically and practically, the only completely satisfactory answer to 1 e4". He said of the Sicilian Defence: "Against the best play, it is bound to fail", and claimed that the Caro-Kann "cannot possibly be suffi cient to give equality". Among many other openings he condemned as inferior, he called the Queen' s Gambit Accepted "a strategic er ror", and the Slav Defence "not adequate" (and "wholly bad" if Black plays ... e6 as well as ... c6, currently a favourite among many of the world' s strongest players !). And in the French Defence, of course, he gave 3 e5 a "?" and called 3 lZJc3 .tb4 "?!", saying "this is well known to be not good". These latter two opin ions, no longer taken seriously, were first chal lenged by Nimzowitsch in his own writings and practice. But Keene makes the point that even the rel atively 'progressive' voices of Nimzowitsch's time tended towards dogmatism. Nimzowitsch himself called the Modern Benoni 'an unfortu nate extravagance' . And Steinitz, the king of eccentric opening moves in the nineteenth cen tury (as well as a brilliant innovator), is quoted by Tarrasch as telling Charousek, who had lost to Tarrasch in a Pirc Defence (in 1896!) that "If you choose such a weird opening, you shouldn't be surprised if you lose the game !". Reti, an avowed opponent of dogmatism in chess, refer ring to 1 e4, claimed that his own opinion that "the reply l ...e5 is a mistaken one and will be refuted by the consistent attack against e5 as exemplified in the Ruy Lopez is admitted today in the practice of the masters". He also claims that "it can be established that there are two defences against 1 e4 which make it absolutely impossible for the first player to obtain any ini tiative, and which give Black such an even game, without any difficulties at all, that it has become unwise in practical play to open with 1 e4, since these defences are generally known. They are the Caro Kann Defence and ... 1 e4 e6
2 d4 d5 3 lZJc3 lZJf6 4 .tg5 dxe4." Despite a
modest revival of the latter defence, no one considers it a serious deterrent to 1 e4, and the Caro- Kann is still challenged regularly and with normal success by the world's top players, who have yet to abandon 1 e4 in consequence. There are certainly many other examples. Alekhine, the most creative opening player of his day, and probably the first who investigated openings well into the middlegame in a truly modern fashion, shared the tendency to reject moves of an experimental nature. We will talk
96 SECRETS OF MODERN CHESS STRATEGY
about his stubborn and rather bizarre views on the Sicilian Defence in a later chapter. He had an aversion to even the most clearly favourable Hedgehog structures for Black, and in general, seemed to dislike the fianchetto. For example, he considered the King's Indian Defence infe rior due to the Four Pawns Attack(!), and ac cording to Keene, he felt that 1 ...g6 was 'a joke' (I'm not sure where this is from; but I found that in his Best Games, he at any rate says that l ...g6 is 'rightly considered inferior' and in the New York 1 924 tournament book he calls it 'not valid'). Alekhine also maintained that in the Griinfeld, after 1 d4 ltJf6 2 c4 g6 3 lDc3 d5, 4 cxd5 was a poor move, 'especially after' 4 ...lDxd5 5 e4, when Black's attack on White's centre after ... lDxc3 and ...c5 gave him 'at least equality' . It is interesting that as late as 1 943, in The Ideas Behind the Chess Openings (and in later editions), Reuben Fine shared these last two views, saying that versus 1 e4 g6, 2 d4 al ready gave White an 'appreciable advantage', and that after the above 5 e4 in the Griinfeld, "Black may well get the better of it". Fine then followed up with a lengthy prose discussion to prove that " 'ii' b3 is the key move for all white attacks in the Griinfeld," a statement he put in italics and called a 'useful rule' . What is most interesting about Fine's assertions is that he ar rives at them via prose explanations and gen eral principles, adducing almost no concrete variations. By this time, the new Soviet players had already abandoned such an approach in fa vour of concrete analysis. To conclude, who are the villains of this in troductory piece? For one thing, a narrow view of the game in which whole areas seem ex cluded. But even more so, a dogmatic ap proach. And what does dogma in chess consist of? A blind obedience to the strictures of some general rule or principle. Therefore, we now turn to Chapter 2 to see what's up with such rules and principles.
2 Rule-Independence
Many changes have taken place in modern chess, for example, with respect to new ideas about weaknesses, the relative strengths of mi nor pieces, the value of the exchange, and con siderations of time and dynamism. But the forerunner and in some sense precursor to these changes has been a philosophic notion, now so entrenched that we barely notice it. I call this notion 'rule-independence' , for lack of a more comprehensive way to express it. It is simply the gradual divestment on the part of chess players of the multitudinous generalities, rules, and abstract principles which guided classical chess, and which still dominate our teaching texts. Furthermore, a rejection of the very no tion of the 'rule' has taken place, in favour of a pragmatic investigation of individual situa tions. The intense study of large numbers of po sitions, in combination with a dramatic increase in the frequency of play by the average profes sional player, has led to a new approach to chess knowledge. This approach might be de scribed in terms of 'unconscious principles', or subtle and verbally inexpressible guidelines which are continually modified and weighted to fine-tune the assessment of positions. A 'feel' for positional chess is developed, just as in the old days, but one which is unconstrained (or considerably less constrained) by dogma. Hence, 'rule-independence' . Well, those are just words until I provide some supporting examples, which I will give aplenty in this chapter and throughout Part 2. Before moving on, however, let me risk repeat ing some of my discussion from Part 1 , Chapter 1, if only to give the reader some perspective, and to allow others to speak on this topic. In the last chapter, we began to touch on a number of dogmatic views which led even the most bril liant of players and thinkers to make some rather foolish assessments about certain posi tions. My contention was that adherence to rules and general principles played a major role in these rnisassessments. At some point around the 1 930s, this dogmatism began to change in earnest, and Nimzowitsch himself was proba bly the leading figure in the' new attitude. The so-called Hypermodern School was partially responsible for the change, and I'd like to re peat what Reti (a leading Hypermodern spokes man) said: "It is the aim of the modern school not to treat every position according to one· general law, but according to the principle inherent in the position. An acquaintance with other posi tions and the rules applicable to the treatment thereof is of great use for the purpose of analys ing and obtaining a grasp of the particular posi tion under consideration ... the source of the greatest errors is to be found in those moves that are made merely according to rule and not based on the individual plan or thought of the player." The transitional figure in this modernization, at least among world champions, was certainly Alekhine. We have already seen a sample of his occasional narrow-mindedness in the last chap ter; but he was also the first player who system atically deepened his research into a wide variety of openings, and he played positions with a pragmatic reliance upon involved calcu lations, which is typical of the modern style. At roughly the same time as Reti, Znosko-Borov sky, in The Middle Game in Chess, commented about this side of Alekhine: " .. .in the middle game, when a certain plan is under consideration, the general principles ( oc cupation of the centre, open lines, strong and weak squares) are of less account than the se lection of an object of attack, against which all the available forces are to be launched. On this point Alekhine goes so far as to say 'all general considerations must be entirely forgotten' and 'only that which contributes to the execution of the plan selected is of any avail."' Pachman adds to these sentiments in his Complete Chess Strategy, Vol 1, in a chapter called "The Development of Modern Chess". He describes Alekhine as discovering aspects of play "which lay beyond the limits of acquired
98 SECRETS OF MODERN CHESS STRATEGY
principles and which almost defied human un derstanding ... Alekhine's victory [over Capa blanca] was significant, because it pointed to the inexhaustible possibilities of chess while refut ing arguments about the stagnation of the game." It is this association between being 'beyond principles' and opening inexhaustible possibili ties that interests us. Jumping forward to our time, it might be worthwhile to hear about some related topics from Mark Dvoretsky, certainly one of the best, if not the best, characterizer of the features of modern play. Dvoretsky talks about rules which relate to certain types of po sitions, like 'opposite-coloured bishops in the middlegame favour the attacker' . Then he goes on to say: "However, in grandmasters' and mas ters' arsenals there are also several finer, less formal evaluations. We understand that 'in cer tain positions you have to act a certain way' , but at times it is difficult to formulate exactly what that 'certain position' is." His point is that deep study of many related positions (and the open ings from which they arise) is the concrete method by which this difficulty is resolved. It is important to distinguish between 'rules' in the sense given above and practical guidelines for play. Such guidelines may be stated in a rule format, but they are essentially just helpful re minders, and don't need 'refuting', because they are assumed to be of limited application. A good example of such a guideline, which has very many exceptions and yet is still a useful thing to ponder over the board, is the idea of im proving the position of one's worst piece. Kosikov points out that in slow, manoeuvring positions where "time is not of decisive signifi cance" (alas, how many such positions are there?), activating the worst-placed piece is generally a good idea. I don't doubt that all strong players heed this rule, even if only sub consciously, in the sense that they are very aware of poorly-placed pieces and are always factoring in how feasible it is to improve their position. But it is not a theoretical principle of the type "backward pawns on an open file are weak", for example. Incidentally, Alekhine had an interesting variant of Kosikov's rule. He said about an early knight move in the opening: "the development problem of this knight, being here the most elaborate one, must be solved on the very first opportunity." [italics his] There is a lot of validity to this idea, although it makes a rather poor 'rule' , because in many openings, the problem piece (e.g., the bishop on c8 in a Stonewall Dutch Defence) is attended to only after most of the other pieces are out. Still, if one considers various French Defence varia tions with White having e5 in (Advance Varia tion, Winawer, or Tarrasch with 3 liJd2 liJf6 4 e5), there exist some lines (by no means all) in which Black spends several tempi trying to do something useful with his c8-bishop before he begins to get his other pieces out and gets cas tled. Similarly, in the Caro-Kann Defence, Black often plays ... i.f5 (or ... i.e6 or ... i.g4) at the first opportunity. Sometimes one may even move the king at an early stage, just to resolve its status and clear the way for other pieces. While on this subject, some such 'guideline rules' are probably just as suspect as the more concrete ones. While the reader may be quite open to a rejection of rules like 'knights on the rim stand badly' , for example, he or she is less likely to feel comfortable with any questioning of that most-repeated of all principles: 'The most important thing is to have a plan' (or: 'planless play leads to disaster' ). I will have more to say about this later in the book, but hear what Dvoretsky says in a section called 'The Plan' : ''There is a popular opinion that the high est strategic art is the ability to envelop nearly the whole game in a profound plan, and that this is precisely how leading grandmasters think. This is a delusion. It is nonsensical to map out an overly long plan - the very next move could totally change the situation on the board and give it a completely different direction." He then goes on to talk about using the phrase 'the next strategic operation' in place of the word 'plan', to emphasize the local, time-limited, and pragmatic nature of most actual planning. I think that this is a very astute distinction which applies particularly to the heavy and multi faceted positions which arise from so many modern openings. The Demise of the General Rule; Examples from Practice Andy Soltis opens his excellent book The Art of Defence with a humorous little example which

I hope that he doesn't mind me pilfering: Khliavin - Zhdanov Latvian Ch 1961 This position arose after 1 e4 c6 2 lt:Jc3 d5 3 lt:Jf3 g6 4 d4 i..g7 5 h3 a6 6 i..f4 lt:Jf6 7 e5 lt:Jg8 8 'ii' d2 b5 9 i.. e2 h6 10 O-O-O e6. Here Soltis comments: "It doesn't take long to conclude that White has a very strong game. He has developed nearly all of his pieces while Black's only developed piece, his king's bishop, bites on granite. Black's queenside is full of holes on dark squares and he has just locked in his queen' s bishop. A quick mating attack is as sured, you might conclude. And you'd be right: 1 1 g4 lt:Jd7 12 i..g3 i..f8 13 lldfl lt:Jb6 14 lt:Jd1 aS 15 lt:Je1 b4 16 lt:Jd3 lt:Jc4 17 'ii' e1 'ii b6

And in less than 20 moves from tli.e diagram." A clever rhetorical device by Andy. One might also notice a few other features of this ex ample which he doesn't mention. By move 17, Black still only has one piece not on its original square! And it is a piece he has moved three times, whereas two other pieces he has moved twice each ... back to their starting positions ! Having violated every rule in the book, what does he then do? Moves his queen out, of course, and conducts a little one-piece attack which wraps up the game. Soltis's point is about the art of defending well, but it's not clear that much defence was involved here. More relevant, it seems to me, was Black's violation of classical precepts in favour of concrete structural goals. Now, I wouldn't argue that in the above game Black's provocation was fully correct (although it may have been so); but I would say that it involves a typical modern tendency, even if in a rather ex treme form. A number of traditional rules are jettisoned in seemingly casual fashion, such as: developing one's pieces; not moving a piece twice in the opening; not making too many pawn moves in the opening (7 of the first 10 moves), and especially notflank pawns (here, advanced versus no corresponding weakness in the opponent's position); and finally, not mov ing the queen out before the other pieces. This sort of black set-up is unusual, but not completely so. Soltis's example came from a Caro-Kann Defence, but off the top of my head, I can think of two other openings in which such undeveloping strategies are pursued fairly of ten: the French Defence (various lines with ... b6 and ... i..b4-f8 or ... lt:Jf6-g8) and the Mod ern Defence. And less extreme forms arise throughout chess, for example, in the Alekhine, Pirc, and Scandinavian Defences. Here's an example of a different type of rule-independence which illustrates a number of key modern notions: Suba - Sax Hastings 1983/4
1 c4 c5 2 lt:Jf3 lt:Jf6 3 lt:Jc3 d5 4 cxd5 lt:Jxd5 5 e4
Nimzowitsch! He first played this versus Rubinstein in 1 926. In general, Nimzowitsch was the first player to ignore backward pawns and structural weaknesses in so many situa tions. In this case, White's d-pawn is classically backward on an open file, and there is a terrible hole on d3. In fact, White's strategy was slow to catch on; Botvinnik (who was also uninhibited by backward d-pawns) was the next to pick it up, and not until the 1 970s was there a real re vival of the move. 5 ... lt:Jb4 6 i..c4 These moves have now been played hun dreds of times, of course; but they have a won derful beginner's quality to them, don't you think? Notice that 6 d4 cxd4 7 lt:Jxd4?? fails to 7 .. .'�xd4.
100 SECRETS OF MODERN CHESS STRATEGY
6 ... l2Jd3+ 7 'it>e2 l2Jf4+ 8 'it>fi l2Je6 (D) w Which side is being more 'modern'? White dances around with his king and ignores weak nesses, whereas Black moves the same knight for the sixth time, when no other piece has been touched! But notice that he prevents d4, consid ering a structural gain worth more than mere considerations of development. 9 lDe5!? This opening is a terrific example of modern play. 9 d3, which would solidify the centre and free the c 1-bishop, is hardly ever played (4 times out of 1 10 games in the database I'm looking at, and only in the least modern exam ples). The text-move is apparently less logical, moving an already developed piece, and further abandoning control of the key square d4; but it is in fact much more to the point than 9 d3. The really revealing thing is to consider White's two main alternatives to those moves. The first one, played in numerous very high level grandmaster games, is 9 b4!? (D).
B
OK, giving up a flank pawn for central con trol is not exactly unheard of, but when Black has no weaknesses, and White can't castle and connect rooks? Well, it turns out that after 9 ...cxb4 10 lDe2 !, White is about to play d4, and then things like .i.b2, h4-h5, and :h3 or :h4, when his mobile centre and lead in devel opment probably more than make up for his pawn deficit (see, for example the game Hub ner-Tukmakov, Wijk aan Zee 1984 and later ex amples). The king on f1 suddenly doesn't stand so badly. Eventually, someone figured out that by de clining White's offer and offering his own pawn instead, Black could gain a critical tempo needed to cover d4, by 9 ...g6! 10 bxc5 .i.g7. Without pursuing opening theory too far, it turns out that after 1 1 .i.xe6 .i.xe6 12 d4 l2Jc6 1 3 .i.e3 'WaS intending ... O-O-O, Black gets great pressure for the pawn, with equality being the ultimately most probable result. Needless to say, although the books stop there, this is not the end of the story. An entirely logical newer development by White (after unsatisfactory re sults with 10 bxc5) was 10 nb1 .i.g7 1 1 lDe2!, as in Losos-Radola, corr. 1993 and a couple of other games, keeping an eye on d4 and contem plating bxc5 and/or .i.xe6. In fact, this whole variation probably deserves more attention, which is also the typical verdict for hundreds of newly-invented positions in our extraordinarily rich chess age. An even more bizarre outcome of this debate was White's next attempt from the penultimate diagram, Suba's 9 h4 !?, which Murey may have been the first to play. Well, why not? If Black wants to spoil my fun with ... g6, says White, I'll be ready for h5 in response ! This Larsenesque move (when in doubt, advance your rooks' pawns !) is not as silly as it looks. Suba gives 9 ... h6 10 l2Je5 ! (in view of 10 ... g6? 11 'ir'f3; compare the next note in the game); and 9 ...l2Jc6 10 l2Jg5 ! l2Jxg5?! 1 1 hxg5, which he says is better for White, although I'm not so sure after l l ...g6. Suba (a truly modern thinker, even for these times, to whom we will return in later chapters) says that ''The move 9 h4 corre sponds to the position's general requirements and increases White's potential. It provides luft for the white king, space for the rook and an outpost on g5 ."
RULE-INDEPENDENCE 101
Whatever. The interesting thing to me here is the sequence of games by which these ideas were reached. In hindsight, of course, any crazy move can be justified 'positionally', but it took top-flight GMs many years even to find 9 b4. In fact, 9 d3 or 9 g3 was played in the few games of the 1930s and 1940s, and 9 b4 wasn't discov ered until the 1980s. Then many well-publicized games occurred before Black hit upon the 9 ...g6 idea. And really, is 9 h4 a brilliantly-conceived move arising purely out of the 'demands of the position' ? Of course not. As Suba himself states, he found it after becoming disillusioned with 9 lDe5 g6! (see the next note). It is, like 9 b4 or even 8 ...lDe6 or 5 e4 (both of which were new ideas at one point), a pragmatic response to a concrete problem. This is very important to un derstand. In modern chess, the analysis and work come first, and the supporting verbiage comes later (if at all) for the sake of closure, or more often, for the sake of the popular audience. Now we return to the position after 9 lDe5 :
B
9 .. .'ii'd6 Suba points to earlier games with 9 .....d4 10 'ii' a4+ i.d7 1 1 lDxd7 'ifxd7 with satisfactory play for Black. Ironically, the two moves which actually bring out a new minor piece, 9 ...ltJd7? 10 lDxf7 ! 'iftxf7 1 1 i.xe6+ �xe6 12 'ifb3+ with a winning attack (as occurred in one game), and 9 ...ltJc6?! 10 lDxc6 bxc6 1 1 d3 (intending i.e3, lDa4, .l:.c1, etc.) both favour White. In fact, it is to prevent ...ltJc6 or ...liJd7 that 9 lDe5 is played; and in that sense, it is a prophylactic move, a concept we will discuss in later chapters. Finally, Black (specifically Timman) found 9 ...g6!, a move which Suba calls 'rock-solid' . It is typical, I think, that the latter move, still re fraining from bringing a piece out, but aiming at the critical d4-square, is the one which even tually came to be the solution to 9 lDe5. The fact that the directly developing moves are un satisfactory may be the result of some deep principle, but if so, it was a principle unknown to grandmasters ! Rather, they subjected this variation to increasingly deep and creative analysis until the truth of the position began to reveal itself. Once again, then, this is an exam ple of pragmatism replacing principle.

I doubt it; we should say instead that the tactics end up fa vouring White. If even one such line had worked for Black, White would simply have to abandon 9 lDe5 (or 10 f4, or 1 1 'ii' a4) as insuffi cient to achieve an advantage. 12 d4! Suddenly, lines are ripped open and the game concludes in the way any Morphy or Alekhine game might have. As 12 ...

While it is cer tainly a fun little miniature, I don't think the av erage modern professional would play through it with a feeling of amazement or incredulity. We have internalized the modern, pragmatic approach to such an extent that the moves seem
102 SECRETS OF MODERN CHESS STRATEGY
almost 'normal' . But it would be great fun to see this game annotated by Tarrasch, Capablanca, or even Alekhine! I suspect we would get a number of expressions of horror, at least be tween moves 5 and 9, as well as a healthy dose of ridicule. And it's highly doubtful that any of them would have suggested 9 h4 as an im provement! The following example (also dealt with in Neil McDonald's book Positional Sacrifices), is far less eccentric, but illustrates the flaunting of two general rules in the more tranquil setting of a queenless middlegame: Vusupov - Christiansen Las Palmas 1993
1 d4 d6 2 e4 lDf6 3 f3 eS 4 dxeS dxeS 5 'ii'
xd8+ �xd8 6 i.c4 i.e6 7 i.xe6 fxe6 (D) Right from the start, we see a willingness to take on the dreaded doubled pawns. What's worse, they are isolated as well ! But Black has two reasons to feel secure. One is that the set of doubled centre pawns controls important squares on the only open file, namely d4 and d5, as well as f5 and f4. The other is simply the pragmatic consideration that Black's e-pawns are difficult to attack and relatively easy to de fend. w 8 lDh3! Don't put your knights on the rim! Well, knights are living on the edge these days, as we shall see in Chapter 5. But the case before us is really simple. Neither side is about to make any dramatic pawn-breaks, so there is plenty of time to manoeuvre pieces to their best posts. In the case before us, that would involve the knight going to d3 via f2; where would it go from e2? As McDonald points out, lDf2-d3 could be followed by lDd2-c4 and i.d2-c3 with a three-way attack on the forward e-pawn. 8 ... i.c5 So Black decides to cede his (relatively bad) bishop to prevent White's idea. 9 lDf2 i.xf2+ 10 <Ji>xf2 lDc6 11 .Be3 <Ji>e7 12 lDa3! Yusupov has no inhibitions about these flank knights! This time, the idea is more subtle: he doesn't want Black's knight settling in on d4, so he will be playing c3 soon. Then - behold! - a route to the ideal d3-square has been opened: lDc2-e 1-d3.
12. ..a6?!
McDonald rightly criticizes this move, sug gesting simply 12. ..l:.ad8 13 c3 ( 1 3 lDb5 a6 14 lDxc7? l:td7 1 5 i.b6 l:tc8) 13. ..l:.d7 and ...l:thd8 "and Black would have a safe position". White could probably keep up a nagging pressure for many moves to come; but such a position argu ably justifies Black's decision to take on the doubled pawns at move 6. See also the note to Black's 16th move.
13 c3 l:.hd8 14 <Ji>e2 h6
Again, 14 ...l:.d7 was preferable. 15 lDc2 l::. d7 16 l:hd1 l:tad8 McDonald points out that had Black doubled earlier, then either both pairs of rooks would now come off (and therefore White's later pawn advances would not open files for a remaining rook, as happens in the game); or White would have to allow Black complete control of the d file. One feels that in that case, the game would probably have been drawn. 17 l:txd7+ l:xd7 18 lDe1 lDe8 19 lDd3 lDd6 20 i.f2! With the plan of i.g3 followed by b4, a4, l:tbl, and b5 .

24 b4! A very interesting decision. White will give up the apparently powerful d4-square to Black's knight, because he sees that in the resulting po sition, e5 will be weak and he may have a dev astating passed a-pawn. 24 ... l:td8

Now we've returned to a type of classical technique (which Mayer calls 'the Steinitz Re striction Method'), used by the possessor of a bishop versus a knight in the endgame. First the knights' forward outposts are taken away by pawns (here, b5 and e4); and then White opens lines for his bishop (here, by c4-c5). Yusupov points out that the immediate 26 c4 is tricky due to 26 ...c5 ! 27 bxc6 lL!xc6, although in fact, White looks much better in that case as well.
26...
l:lb8 27 c4 c5 Now, although White won with the sacrifice 28 lL!xc5? ! bxc5 29 .i.xc5, this may not have been sufficient for an objectively winning ad vantage. Far better, as it turns out, was the other sacrifice 28 .i.xc5 ! bxc5 29lL!xc5, for example, 29 ....l:.a8 30 liJd7+ �g6 3 1 c5 and the pawns are simply devastating. This was a simple but instructive game be tween two creative players. Both of their ideas were almost certainly legitimate, but White had the better practical chances and on this day, also played better. One doubts if either GM was bur dened by doubts about 'breaking the rules' of chess. Description Versus Reality Before entering into discussions of specific rules and principles, I should make a simple distinction which applies to my notes as well as anyone else's. One must always keep in mind the difference between a description of play and the play itself. For all I will say about re jecting rules, it is still true that we must use them as tools when annotating a game. Thus, for example, there is no substitute for saying something like: "and Black stands better be cause of his two bishops and White's backward pawn on the open d-file." One simply has to bear in mind that such a statement has an im plied subtext, for example: "Black stands better because, although there are many cases of two bishops being inferior, this is not one of them, since the knights in this particular position have no useful outposts and White can't play the pawn-break that might force a transformation of the pawn structure leading to the creation of an outpost (or he could do so, but at the cost of allowing a strong attack against his king, as shown by this variation ..., etc.). Also, although backward pawns are perfectly acceptable in many positions, the one in this exact position is actually weak because it lacks the protection of a bishop on e2 and White can't implement the dynamic pawn-breaks by b4 or d4 which would normally justify taking on such a backward pawn. For example, 23 b4 would fail to ...", and so forth. Naturally, we don't kill trees for the sake of such explanations, which in reality are usually even more complicated and qualified than the one I have given. Instead, we use abbreviated statements of principles as indicators to guide the reader's thoughts in the direction of our own. It is very important to realize that a player's use of such descriptions in written notes by no means implies he had given thought to them during the game. I think that there is a great danger here for the student. He or she will pick up a book of annotated games by some world-class player and assume from such gen eral descriptions that "this is the way the great players think". In reality, most players are un concerned with giving exact descriptions of their thought-processes; it is much easier to characterize a position generally, with hind sight, and ignore the gory details. For those who want something more revealing, although difficult, I recommend Jon Speelman's excel lent collection (see the Bibliography), which provides a refreshing dose of reality for those who think they can get by on general consider ations alone.
104 SECRETS OF MODERN CHESS STRATEGY
The Royal Guard and How It Strays Let's move on now to some snapshot examples of how modern chess treats (or mistreats) the general rules and principles of yore, with the understanding that we will be saying much more about such principles in the following chapters on pawn play, the bishop, the knight, etc. We already talked about the precept against 'pawn-hunting when undeveloped', and espe cially hunting for flank pawns, in Chapter 2 of Part 1. I could conceivably have included that discussion in this more 'revolutionary' section of the book, since players are now willing to go to great lengths to secure a pawn in so many sit uations. Please refer there for some typical ex amples. A similar older precept, also dealing with pawns (and originating with Steinitz) is that one should not move pawns in front of one's king. The basis for this idea is fairly straightforward. If, in a position where Black has castled on the kingside after a double e pawn opening, for example, Black moves his pawn to h6, that pawn is a natural target for the advance g4-g5, opening the g-file. In an analo gous manner, if the same king is resting on the queenside, the move ...a6 or ... c6 begs for retri bution by b4-b5, whereas ... b6 tempts advances such as a4-a5. Today, one sees players moving the pawns in front of their kings on a regular basis, particu larly in certain pawn structures. It's fair to say that this tends to be associated with one of two factors which make this 'obviously' OK: a) one side has a space advantage on that side of the board, as well as a stable centre, so that counterattack against one's king is hardly a danger; b) one or both sides has fianchettoed, so by definition, there is a pawn moved right in front of the king (i.e., g3 or ... g6); in such a situation, additional moves like h3/...h6 and f4/...f5 tend to be much safer. If case 'b' seems like a silly example, we dis cuss elsewhere the enormous prejudice against the fianchetto which persisted well into the 1920s and 1930s; part of the objection to the fianchetto was, of course, weakening squares around one's king and giving pawns a target for attack. There is also a third idea behind the advance of pawns in front of the castled king: c) prophylaxis, or the preventing of con crete ideas which one's opponent might want to implement. All three of these reasons will be encountered below. Let's look at a main-line King's Indian De fence for a moment:
1 d4 lt:Jf6 2 c4 g6 3 lt:Jc3 j_g7 4 e4 d6 5 lt:Jf3
O-O 6 j.e2 e5 7 O-O lt:Jc6 8 d5 lt:Je7 (D) w Black has ...g6 already in, of course, but as lengthy experience has shown, he will also not hesitate to play for ... f5, and then further ... f4, ... g5-g4, etc. We are so used to this that it almost goes without saying. Furthermore, it hardly seems like such a radical or modern thing to do, since the pawn-chains dictate a black kingside attack and a white one on the queenside. Well, there are several interesting things to discuss here. First of all, this is a very good ex ample of how flexible modern chess strategy is. I have just said that the pawn structure 'dictates' ... f5-f4, etc., as if there is a principle involved here. But it turns out that it is only the concrete nature of the position which commands the troops. As students of the King's Indian De fence know, had White played the venerable and still-popular line 7 d5 a5 8 j.g5 h6 9 j.h4 lt:Ja6 (D), a whole new 'principle' arises: In fact, after either 10 O-O or 10 lt:Jd2, Black much more frequently plays ... h5 (another pawn move in front of the king!) than .. .f5. For example, 10 O-O 'ii' e8 (or here 10. .. j.d7 lllt:Jd2 'ii' b8!? 12 a3lt:Jh7 13 :bl h5!) lllt:Jd2lt:Jh7 12
RULE-INDEPENDENCE 105
a3 .td7, and doesn't it look like Black has been preparing .. .f5? But it happens that after each of 13 liJb5, 13 �h1, and 13 b3, the move 13 ... h5 is the more popular one, and ... f5 is indefinitely delayed or sometimes skipped. It turns out that in this case, the activation of the 'bad' bishop on g7 takes precedence. This is a result of years of experimentation and analysis, and any rules one might want to adduce to explain it would be rather feeble in the face of the powerful mes sage sent by that practice. Of course there are many other examples from the same pawn structure, for example, ones in which Black actually plays on the queenside and foregoes ... f5. This occurs in the main 7 O-O ltJc6 lines after 8 d5 ltJe7 9 liJd2 c6 or 9 ... i.d7
10 a3 a5 intending ...a4; but also fairly fre
quently after 7 O-O liJbd7, e.g., 8 .l::r. e 1 c6 9 .tn a5 10 .l::r. b1 l:te8 11 d5 lLlc5 and ideas like ... .td7, ... cxd5 and ... b5 or ... a4 can follow, de pending upon the course of play. The point is that just shifting the position of Black's knights slightly can completely change his most appro priate plan. Nevertheless, I sense that the reader will not be overly impressed with this example. Every one knows that Black can get away with ... f5 and other kingside pawn moves in such a posi tion because he has the natural levers there, and his king is quite safe. What's the big deal? Well, let's look at this from the other point of view, White's. So it's obvious that the kingside is Black's territory, right? How about this modern idea in the same variation:
1 d4 liJf6 2 c4 g6 3 ltJc3 .tg7 4 e4 d6 5 liJf3
O-O 6 .te2 e5 7 O-O ltJc6 8 d5 ltJe7 9 ltJel lLld7
10 f3 f5 11 g4!? (D)
This is a fully legitimate move which has been played in hundreds of GM games. It is, again, a purely pragmatic move: White wants to block the kingside, normally by h4 and g5. Then he will have a free hand on the queenside with the standard c5 break. A related system, developed later, is probably more effective; in stead of 10 f3 in this line, he plays 10 ttJd3 f5 11 .td2 lLlf6 12 f3 f4 13 g4!?, an irritating varia tion for Black to meet, against which he can end up positionally lost if he fails to respond accu rately. So did the pawn structure 'dictate' white pawn advances in front of his king as well? That would be a tough case to make, whereas the pragmatic approach (if it works, I'll play it) seems more persuasive. Let's continue to look at this opening from White's point of view. One modern idea in a very old system is:
1 d4 liJf6 2 c4 g6 3 ltJc3 .tg7 4 e4 d6 5 liJf3
O-O 6 .te2 liJbd7 7 O-O e5 8 .te3 c6 9 d5 c5 10 lLle1 ltJe8 11 g4! (D)

106 SECRETS OF MODERN CHESS STRATEGY
Wrong side of the board, isn't it? Previously, 11 tiJd3 had been the main move. Let's see how play continued in some typi cal examples from the diagram: 1l...f5 12 exf5 gxf5 13 gxf5 lDb6 14 lDf3! (an earlier game Gelfand-Romero, Wijk aan Zee 1992 also illus trates White's little notion: 14 �h1 j_xf5 15 l:lg 1 lDf6 16 liJf3! lDg4 17 lDg5 lDxe3 18 fxe3 e4 19 lDe6!, winning) 14... j_xf5 15 lDg5 fte7 16 'iti>h1 lDf6 17 .l:tg1 �h8 18 ftd2 with a clear advantage (Kramnik also gives 18 l::r. g3!?) Kramnik-Knaak, Dortmund 1992. You may no tice, by the way, that the players of White in these games, so coolly advancing that pawn in front of their king on the 'wrong' side of the board, are mere 2700+ players. What about the other side of the board? Well, White doesn't castle queenside much in the King's Indian, but an obvious example of mov ing pawns in front of the king arises in the Samisch Variation:
1 d4 lDf6 2 c4 g6 3 ltJc3 j_g7 4 e4 d6 5 f3 O-O
6 j_e3 eS 7 dS lDhS 8 'i¥d2 fS 9 O-O-O tiJd7 10 j_d3 ltJcS 11 j_c2 a6 12 ltJge2 (D) OK, we have opposite-side castling, and Black (so far) has only advanced pawns on the side his king is on. What should White do? Well, anyone who is familiar with this type of position knows that White has won many games by pushing his queenside pawns aggres sively forward, as if his king were safely tucked away elsewhere. The usual idea is b4 and c5, and if Black plays the logical ... a5, White gen erally plays a3 and simply allows the open a file. It turns out (a key phrase in this book, which emphasizes that these conclusions have been reached by dint of long practice) that White's space advantage and greater manoeuv ring room on the queenside is just enough to offset the dangerous-looking pawn-breaks Black can try on the queenside. White's space pro tects him from attack. That's the idea. Let's see an example from practice, in which the black player puts up re sistance to this idea, as one might expect from a world champion: 12 ...b5! Timman - Kasparov Linares 1992 Black lashes out; let's see what happens if he doesn't act quickly: 12 ... b6 13 'it>b1 l:.b8 14 b4! f4 15 j_f2 tiJd7 16 tiJcl l:.f7 17 'it>a1 j_f8 18 tiJd3 and White soon broke with c5 in Gheor ghiu-Yanofsky, Tel-Aviv 1966. Such positions have arisen time and again, and are very awk ward for Black.

But as the combined analysis of var ious players later showed, he could have played simply 23 �b1! with a large advantage, the main line running 23 ... l:.xf3 24 l:.hfl l:r.xfl 25 l:.xfl .i.b7 26 lDf6+! .i.xf6 27 gxf6 1i'f7 28 lDa5!, and Timman demonstrated a clear edge for White from this position. The details aren't important, of course. What we see is that in the King's Indian Defence, both sides can and do advance pawns in front of their kings, regardless of 'whose' side of the board they're contesting. Another very interesting example of this phenomenon comes up in the French Defence, Winawer Variation. After years and years of games following the moves 1 e4 e6 2 d4 d5 3 lDc3 .i.b4 4 e5 c5 5 a3 .i.xc3+ 6 bxc3, White has tried any number of set-ups with moves such as lDf3, a4, .i.a3, .i.d3 and the like. But only in recent years has the idea of playing h4- h5 taken hold. To begin with, that idea was used mainly for attacking purposes, with a rook-lift to h4, perhaps followed by l:.g4 (to attack the kingside), or by dxc5 and l:.hb4 (to attack a black king on the queenside). Only in the last few years has White realized that h4-h5 goes well with castling kingside. This might seem paradoxical (why weaken the h5-pawn and the kingside at the cost of two tempi?), but in fact, it is a prophylactic advance, designed to thwart Black's normal course of action. Consider this position:

Then he either gains a big centre by meeting exf6 with ... gxf6 or is able to gain in fluence on the kingside by ...fxe5, ... .l::t df8, and often, pushing his remaining pawns on that side of the board.

with direct attack; one feels that the strictures against moving pawns in front of one's king must have played some role in this reluctance. Affording Common Courtesy to a Horse Another of the old saws which infiltrated my young chess consciousness was "develop knights before bishops". I believe Lasker was fond of this one; of course, he may never have meant it to be more than a general guideline, but it turned out to a usable rule in the classical open ings. For example, in double e-pawn openings, you're likely to make that ti:Jf3 move before i.c4 or i.b5, and certainly ti:Jc3 tends to come before any false start by the queen's bishop. In the Queen's Gambit, moreover, we have both ti:Jc3 and ti:Jf3 before any bishop move in many lines (for example, in the Semi-Tarrasch, most Tarrasch QGDs, and almost all Slav Defences); and at least the queen's bishop is polite enough to wait for the b1-knight to get to c3 before dashing off to g5 in the orthodox Queen's Gam bit Declined positions. Similarly, in the Queen's Gambit Accepted, ti:Jf3 and sometimes ti:Jc3 will generally precede i.xc4. Finally, in the classical English Opening variation, 1 c4 e5, the sequence 2 ti:Jc3 ti:Jf6 3 ti:Jf3 ti:Jc6 was for years the most popular sequence, whereas the main line of the Symmetrical Variation was 1 c4 c5 2 ti:Jc3 ti:Jc6 3 ti:Jf3 (or 3 g3 g6 4 i.g2 i.g7 5 ti:Jf3 ti:Jf6, etc.) 3 ... ti:Jf6 4 g3 g6 5 i.g2 i.g7. These sorts of openings provided the train ing grounds for generations of players, and there arose the general feeling that the develop ment of knights by principle preceded that of bishops. After all, we already know where the knights are going (f3 and c3, f6 and c6, right?), but the bishop has several options along its nat ural diagonal, so why tip your hand too early? But like so many rules, this one often fails in concrete situations. Modern chess is replete with bishop-before-knight developments, which simply take advantage of concrete positional considerations. Let's start with a couple in that same classical English Opening. After 1 c4 e5, the innocent move 2 ti:Jc3 can subject White to harassment by ... i.b4 (e.g., after 2 ... ti:Jf6 3 g3 i.b4) or allow expansion in the centre (e.g., 2 ... ti:Jf6 3 g3 c6, intending 4 i.g2 d5, and the tempo win by ... d4 will justify Black's play in several lines). And the other knight develop ment, 2 ti:Jf3, allows 2 ... e4. Even 2 ti:Jc3 ti:Jf6 3 ti:Jf3 ti:Jc6 4 g3 i.b4 or 4 e3 i.b4 forces White to consider when and whether ... i.xc3 is going to be a threat. So a common modern alternative has been 2 g3, e.g., 2 ... ti:Jf6 3 i.g2 (D).
B
A case of bishops before knights, simply so that Black must commit before he knows where White's knights are going to be. Play often goes 3 ... c6 (3 ... ti:Jc6, following the 'knights before bishops' rule, is actually considered inferior due to 4 ti:Jc3, when 4 ... i.b4 5 ti:Jd5! keeps a small, enduring advantage; again, I simply re fer to the theory, rather than attributing this to any self-evident feature of the position) 4 d4 exd4 5 'ii' xd4 d5 6 ti:Jf3, and White would prefer to play i.g5 or cxd5 and O-O next, rather than commit his other knight to c3 and subject it to harassment from ... c5 and ... d4. This is a modest example, and 2 g3 is by no means 'superior' to 2 ti:Jc3; it is just a valid al ternative. But along the same lines, Black has recently (beginning in the early 1980s) turned his attention to 2 ti:Jc3 i.b4!? (D). By the time of this writing, there have been many hundreds of high-level games with this move, indicating that is has at least a certain credibility; but up to 1970, I can find only 4 such games, and by 1980, only 19 (and those by unknown players)! It's hard to believe that this doesn't to some extent reflect the ancient preju dice against bishops before knights. The re peated adoption of 2 ... i.b4 by players such as Kramnik and Shirov shows what a conceptual
RULE-INDEPENDENCE 109
w shift has taken place. First, if White plays a move such as 3 g3 or 3 e3, Black can capture on c3 and compromise White's pawns, securing plenty of play. Of course, White can gain a tempo for the moment by 3 tbd5; but it doesn't take much reflection to see that the knight on d5 will itself lose a tempo to ... c6, and in any case, it is a second move by the same piece in the opening and hardly the kind of development lead that inspires fear in the second player. In fact, after 3 tiJd5, Black has played 3 ... i.a5, 3 ... i.c5, 3 ... i.d6, and even 3 ... i.e7!?. This last move has intriguing modern aspects to it. Black voluntarily cedes the two bishops, because af ter tbxe7 (a move White has actually foregone in several games), Black can easily expand in the centre by ... tiJf6 (or ...f5 first), ... O-O, ... c6, and ... d5. I must admit that at the current time, White seems to be keeping a small advantage in this line, but arguably no more than in many of the main 1 c4 e5 variations. At any rate, there is no a priori reason to reject ideas such as
2. ..
i.b4. Let's consider some more examples. The reader is probably familiar with some major openings in which the bishop is developed first, for example, the French Defence, Winawer Variation: 1 e4 e6 2 d4 d5 3 tbc3 i.b4 (D). In this opening, Black very often continues to neglect the knights, a few examples being: a) 4 exd5 exd5 5 lDf3 i.g4. b) 4 e5 b6 5 a3 i.f8 (or 5. ..i.xc3+ followed by a quick ... i.a6) 6 tiJf3 i.a6. c) 4 e5 c5 5 a3 i.xc3+ 6 bxc3 'ilic7 and now 7 lDf3 b6 intending ...i.a6, or 7 'ii' g4 f5 8 'ii' h5+ g6 9 'ii' d1 i.d7, intending ... i.a4. In these two cases, Black has decided that resolving the issue of his 'problem bishop' on c8 takes prior ity over developing his knights, which have decent prospects in such a position and need not be hurried to their destinations. The Modern Defence, not surprisingly, of fers us many examples of characteristically modern thinking. Here, too, the theme of 'bish ops before knights' arises. After 1 e4 g6 2 d4 i.g7 3 tbc3, one example of this is Gurgen idze's line 3 ... c6 4 f4 d5 5 e5 h5 6 tiJf3 (against other moves, Black will normally play ... i.g4 or ... i.f5) 6 ... i.g4 (D). Black has achieved his primary goal, to get his c8-bishop out in front of the pawn-chain. He plays ... e6 next, and often, the further bishop move ... i.f8 (to prepare ... c5) will occur before the best posts for both knights are decided upon. Another example after 3 tbc3 is 3 ...d6 4 f4 c6 5 tiJf3 i.g4, and on his next move, having brought both bishops out before his knights, ... 'ii' b6 will normally be preferred to any knight development.
110 SECRETS OF MODERN CHESS STRATEGY
Speaking of modern openings, how about 1 c4 e6 2 d4 b6, the English Defence? In many of the main lines, not only the c8-bishop but also the f8 one is developed before other pieces, e.g.
3 e4 J.b7 4 lt:Jc3 J.b4. And a truly modern
opening is the Trompowsky Attack, all the rage and now well established as a solid system: 1 d4 lt:Jf6 2 J.g5 (D).
B
Why commit the bishop so early, when it may be better-placed on f4 or b2, or even on its original square? Well for one thing, only by moving the bishop immediately to g5 does White force Black into making a committal de cision with respect to his f6-knight. Clearly, if Black already had ... e6 in (e.g., 2 lDf3 e6 3 J.g5), the move ... h6 would be possible, putting the question to the bishop without allowing doubled pawns. Alternatively, ... J.e7 could be played. But with the precise Trompowsky or der, moves such as 2 ... h6, 2 ... d6, 2 ... g6, and 2 ... d5 all allow J.xf6, doubling Black's f pawns, and 2 ... e6 allows White to trade his bishop for the centre by 3 e4 h6 4 J.xf6, when after 4 .. .'ili'xf6 White can seek a more dynamic follow-up than 5 lt:Jf3. A natural alternative is 2 ... lt:Je4, when after 3 J.h4 or 3 J.f4, the knight on e4 will have to lose time to f3, with unclear consequences. (Here the almost too modern 3 h4!? is a whole other story, involving issues of the bishop-pair versus the open h-file and the cramping influence of White's g-pawn). The interesting thing, again, is how many years it took for this simple bishop-before-knight de velopment to catch on. Similarly, there has been a lot of recent interest in the neglected opening 1 d4 d5 2 J.g5. As in the Trompowsky, development of White's other bishop will often precede that of his knights, for example in the variations 2 ... g6 3 e3 J.g7 4 c3 lt:Jd7 5 J.d3 and 2 ... lt:Jf6 3 J.xf6 gxf6 4 c4 dxc4 5 e3 c5 6 J.xc4. In the chapters which follow, we will be ad dressing more rules and principles applying to specific pieces and formations. Traditional strictures against knights on the edge of the board, attacking the front of the pawn-chain, creating backward pawns on open files, ceding outposts, allowing doubled pawns, and the like, will be examined. Broader abstractions are even more vulnerable to criticism. The rule which states that 'a player with more space should avoid exchanges', for example, is so rid dled with exceptions as to have lost its useful ness. I hope that this chapter has given a sense of the process by which the modern player has freed himself from the limitations of such rules, substituting a concrete and pragmatic assess ment of the position at hand. This 'rule independence' forms the basis for the discus sion in succeeding chapters.
3 Modern Pawn Play
The subject of pawns in modern chess could easily fill a book or two. The theory of pawn structures, for example, has probably advanced more than any other area of the game over the last 60 years. Since it's impossible to be com prehensive, this chapter will focus on what I consider to be major changes in our concep tions of pawn play. In the last chapter, we touched upon one such change involving mov ing pawns in front of one's king. That is a mat ter of only limited application, although it casts some light on modern thinking. In this chapter, we move on to more basic issues which are fun damental to the way chess is played today. The core of the chapter will be concerned with pawn-chains, backward pawns, and pawn play on the flanks. Pawns are still the soul of modern chess, so new treatments in these areas and oth ers are reflective of underlying philosophic trends. Furthermore, without a feel for modern pawn play, many of the changes described in succeeding chapters will be lacking in context. New Treatments of the Pawn-chain The treatment of pawn-chains has undergone radical change in recent years. We have already discussed the Nimzowitsch's views on pawn chains (which really superseded all previous thought on the subject) and the modern evolu tion of his approach in Part 1, Chapter 4. We know that Nimzowitsch himself gave most of his attention to the Advance Variation of the French Defence ( 1 e4 e6 2 d4 d5 3 e5) in expli cating his principles, although he also touched lightly upon a King's Indian-like structure (c4, d5, e4 and f3 vs c7, d6, e5 and f5). So it seems appropriate to begin with that same Advance Variation and associated French lines in which White plays e5. Recall that one of Nimzowitsch's key in sights (and the one most often stated as a princi ple in textbooks) is that one should attack the base of the pawn-chain. He adduces a lengthy and compelling argument to that effect, spiced with his usual metaphorical wisdom, e.g., " ... after 1 e4 e6 2 d4 d5 3 e5, the black pawns (e6, d5) are cramped. The attack on the cramp ing white chain should, by our rule, be launched without any delay, by 3 ... c5 rather than 3 .. .£6, for the white e-pawn corresponds to an architectural adornment to our building (the chain), whereas the white d-pawn is the very foundation of the whole structure. If we wish to destroy a building, we would not begin with its architectural ornaments, but we would blow up its foundations, for then the destruction of the ornaments with all the rest will follow automat ically." All very delightful, but one of the themes of this book is how deceptive such explanations can be. An alternative parable would be that the d4- and e5-pawns form a prison building, and the rebelling inmates (playing Black), try as they might, can't get past the guards who are wisely massed to guard the foundations of the building (d4). But they have stolen just enough explosives to take out the front gate (e5), after which they will flood from the prison into free dom (wreaking revenge upon the guards who are now outflanked, etc., etc.).

A few examples should help out. The above diagram arises after 3 e5 c5 4 c3 lbc6 5 lb£3,

when Black has indeed made a start by attack ing the base at d4, but without 'blowing up the foundation' at all, he will then resort to .. .f6 in a majority of modern lines. Here, for example, are two of the main lines, with my comments focused on pawn-chain is sues: a) 5 •.. i.d7 A typically modern move popularized by Korchnoi. The essence of it is to wait to see where White's king's bishop is going before committing the black knight and queen. Thus, in terms we will discuss later, Black gets ahead in the information game. 6 a3 White prepares b4. The move 6 i.e2 is also met by 6 .. .f6 in most games. 6 ...f6 An effective move! The foundations at d4 are likely to be pretty secure after 7 b4, so let's wipe out that gate! 7 i.d3 Trying to keep the prisoners in.

A common result of exchanging pawns on f6; instead of Nimzowitsch's hoped-for pres sure against a backward e-pawn and powerful outpost on e5 calling the shots, Black's superior activity and development ensure him a lasting initiative. 12 'ii' e2l:i.df8 13 lt:Je5 .te8 14 f4 g5!

Certainly a prime example of that would be in the Positional Winawer. For years, White had good success in the variation

His centre col lapses, and if he tries 11 c4 'ii' c7 12 cxd5 tt:\xd5 13 c4l2Jde7 14 exf6 gxf6 15 ..Bc3 O-O-O, Black's superior development more than outweighs the two bishops (in fact, this is an example of how knights paired against bishops are often well served by a quick opening of the position - see Chapter 7). Now let's get away from Nimzowitsch's French Defence and look around with our newly-opened eyes at other pawn-chains. What do we see? Attacking the front of a pawn-chain is part and parcel of contemporary theory. How about the venerable Ruy Lopez? A simple and familiar example begins with the moves 1 e4 e5 2 tt:\f3 tt:\c6 3 ..Bb5 a6 4 ..Ba4 tt:\f6 5 O-O b5 6 ..Bb3 ..Be7 7 :tel O-O 8 c3 d6 9 d4 ..Bg4 10 d5 tt:\a5 1l..Bc2 (D) .
B
By the 'attack the base' principle, Black should be aiming for ... f5, e.g., after ... tt:\e8 or ... tt:\d7. As for White, some kind of build-up in volving b3/c4/c5 might be indicated by pawn chain theory, although this is admittedly rather unlikely. It is interesting to search databases for this position, which unfortunately did not arise a great deal before 1935. When it did, several players indeed played ll...tt:\d7 or ll ... tt:\e8 and ... f5 next, but an equal number simply played ll...c6. Needless to say, White did not play for c5, but calmly transferred his queen's knight to the kingside by the standard tt:\bd2- fl-e3/g3. Of course, there was little pawn-chain dogma to adhere to, since Nimzowitsch had not yet influenced generations of textbooks on the subject. But today, and for at least 50 years, the over whelming preference here has been 11.. .c6 (with a few players choosing ll...'it'd7 or 1l ... 'ii' c8, but following with ... c6 next); out of hundreds of games, the idea of preparing ... f5
114 SECRETS OF MODERN CHESS STRATEGY
just doesn't arise. Why is ... c6 effective? Be cause following 12 dxc6 (creating a backward pawn on an open file, analogous to exf6 in the French), Black's pieces can effectively work on the light squares and compensate for the d5 hole. White is not particularly well developed (see his queenside). After 12 dxc6, one option is simply 12 ... lt:Jxc6, and the reader may notice a remarkable resemblance to the Sveshnikov Sicilian(!), made starker if White plays i.g5 and Black breaks with ... b4. Traditionally more common has been 12 dxc6 "ilic7, after which Black plays ... "ilixc6, puts a rook on d8, and then by either ... i.e6 or ... i.c8-b7 and ... lt:Jc4- b6 genuinely contests the d5-square. To sum marize, Black's active piece play provides a dynamic counterweight to White's control of d5, a square which is difficult to reinforce in practice. Of course, the King's Indian Defence and its cousins, the Old Indian and Modern Defences, are the archetypal modern pawn-chain 1 d4 openings. Speaking of the Old Indian, let's take a look at a couple of typical variations involving d5 (and thus a pawn-chain) following I d4 ti:Jf6
2 c4 d6 3 lt:Jc3 e5 4 li:Jf3 li:Jbd7 5 e4 i.e? (D):
a) 6 g3 O-O 7 i.g2 c6 8 O-O a6 9 d5, and now Black foregoes, for example, 9 ... c5 followed by ... lt:Je8 and ... f5 (attacking the base) in favour of 9 ... cxd5 10 cxd5 b5, e.g., 11 lt:Je1 li:Jb6 12 liJd3 i.d7, when he is ready for ... a5 and ... b4, and has decided to challenge White on the very side where his enemy has a space advantage. This is a sound and pragmatic decision, which has proved to be far more realistic than weaker plans based upon ... f5. b) 6 i.e2 O-O 7 O-O c6 8 d5, and again, Black best idea is to work on the queenside: 8 ... lt:Jc5 9 'ir'c2 a5 10 i.e3 'iic7 11 ti:Jd2 i.d7 with unclear prospects. One might say, 'of course' to these mini examples; in fact, Black almost never seems to play for .. .f5 versus d5 in variations of the Old Indian. But it's worth considering why that is. The relevant comparison is with the King's In dian Defence, where ... f5 is still the main idea in such positions. There, a bishop on g7 pro vides defence for the king after ... g6 and ... f5, particularly after exf5 is met by ... gxf5, the positionally most desirable recapture. But still more important, any breakdown of White's central pawn structure will free the often-lethal bishop on g7 (hence, the great number of ... e4 pawn sacrifices). By contrast, in the Old Indian, the great effort required to break down White's centre, if successful, still does little to activate the bishop on e7. Note that these general rea sons I'm positing are hardly on the level of 'principles'. The pawn structure is the same in either case (assuming that Black plays ... g6 in the Old Indian, which is often a necessary pre lude to ...f5 and paired with, say, ... lDe8-g7). But the structure itself does not dictate Black's correct pawn strategy, as we have seen. Rather, the difference in the position of one piece (Black's king's bishop) does. Let's take a look at pawn-chains in the King's Indian Defence itself. Here, naturally, ... f5 tends to be the main break against a c4/d5/e4 pawn structure, but increasingly, the move ... c6, attacking the front of the pawn chain, proves more useful in certain lines.

For exam ple, after 9 tiJd2, the move 9 ... c6 (or 9 ... aS 10 %:.bl c6)is quite common. And in the Bayonet with 9 b4 tiJh5 10 g3, ... c6 is a frequently-seen idea, e.g., 10...f5 11 tlJg5 tiJf6 12 f3 c6. Of course there are many other examples as well. The fact that such attacks against the front of the pawn-chain no longer surprise us (or even occur to us as a violation of principle) is the best indication that the most fundamental of all pawn-chain principles, attacking the base and not the front of the chain, is no longer a good guide. As we approach the end of this section on pawn-chains, I want to make a few general ob servations. The 'rules' that apply to one pawn chain are often irrelevant to another. In the King's Indian Defence, for example, after Black plays ...f5 and White plays exf5, recap turing with the bishop on f5 is sometimes a use ful option, but mainly because the bishop supports the move ... e4, in turn freeing his g7 comrade. If White succeeds in maintaining a piece on e4 before ...e4 is possible, Black may wish that he had recaptured on f5 with the pawn. In the mirror-image French positions with white pawns on d4, e5, and f4, the move dxc5 can be risky after ... i..xc5, since the bishop hits e3 and t2 in conjunction with moves like ... tlJe7-f5 or ... tt::l h6-g4 and ... 'iWb6. Here, the idea of ... d4 is not important. Another very simple contrast: in the main lines of the King's Indian, Black plays a classic 'break down the base' attack by .. .f5-f4 and ... g5-g4, etc. But as Nimzowitsch points out, in the Advance French White seldom continues with f4-f5, but prefers piece play instead (e.g., i..d3!'iWg4/tlJe2-f4 or some such), although f4-f5 is still a theme in the endgame. These decisions are pragmatic ones, based upon what works. We haven't even talked yet about the type of pawn-chain whose front can't be attacked, for example a typical Modern Benoni structure with ... c5/ ... d6 versus e4/d5 (D): Black's e-pawn has been exchanged, and is therefore unavailable for the frontal attack by ... e6. An interesting thing about such positions is the contrasting strategy of the two sides: White will often (but not always; see the next paragraph) pursue the traditional Nimzo witschian attack on the base; in the long run, f4
116 SECRETS OF MODERN CHESS STRATEGY
and e5 would be ideal. In practice, he first tries to restrain the black queenside majority by a4, and may tie Black to d6 by .i.f4 before he mobi lizes his pawns, but e5 is still a long-term goal. Black, on the other hand, seldom plays for .. .f5, attacking the white base, if only because e6 is likely to become a very serious weakness. In stead, he devotes his efforts to mobilizing his queenside pawns ( ... b5 and ... c4, with ... b4 and ...c3 if possible), in order to win space, activate his pieces and create a passed pawn on that side of the board. But there is one more point to be made about the above structure (e4 and d5 versus ... c5 and ... d6): Black is often able to thwart White's plans for e5 by directing his pieces towards that square (a kind of 'prophylaxis', in the terms of Chapter 9); and yet White then successfully im plements precisely what we've been discuss ing: he attacks the front of the pawn-chain by .:tbl and b4. How does this work? Ideally, once b4 has been played, three things can happen: a) Black plays ... c4, ceding the d4 to a white minor piece such as a knight (hitting b5 and c6) or a bishop (neutralizing the g7-bishop and re newing the idea of f4 and e5); b) In response to White's bxc5, Black plays ... dxc5. This is rare, because White's centre pawns are then unobstructed and mobile; c) In response to White's bxc5, Black plays ... lbxc5. This again cedes the d4-square to a white minor piece, but such an operation must be well-timed, since the black knight on c5 can be very effective. At any rate, the b4 attack on the front of the pawn-chain is a standard part of the modern ar senal. We also haven't discussed other pawn-chain shapes such as the ... c5, ... d6, and ... e5 structure versus c4, d5, and e4, which characterizes the Czech Benoni and some King's Indians (D). From Black's point of view, attack on the two bases by ... b5 and/or ... f5 is obviously indi cated. But aside from the difficulty of achieving these breaks, this formation has some serious drawbacks. Namely, if White attacks the front of both chains, by b4 and f4, then assuming some concession by Black (for example ... exf4 or ... cxb4 ), the base at d6 lacks its residual pro tection (offered by c7 in a normal KID) and can easily fall. Compare the mirror-image French structure (d4/e5/f4 versus ... d5/ ... e6/ ... f5) (D): In this particular case, a break by g4 tends to be more effective than one by c4, and Black's e6 seldom becomes a target, even if ... fxg4 has to be played. In fact, Black's position is so sound that White will often play exf6 e.p. against ...f5 in the French. There are endless

ramifications of these themes; the main point, as before, is that general rules are irrelevant to forming a strategy. Instead, concrete analysis and understanding of the nuances of the posi tion at hand are required. The Positional Pawn Sacrifice Pawn sacrifices for positional goals (as op posed to direct attack) are so common in mod em chess that one cannot even begin to do them justice. A veritable revolution in thinking is re flected in this one aspect of the game alone, and yet textbooks only lightly touch upon the sub ject. Let's see if we can begin to remedy that. Of course, it is difficult to prove that the ear lier masters lacked imagination in regard to positional sacrifices. After all, the nineteenth century was known for chess which involved pitching pawns at the first opportunity. But those sacrifices were specifically designed to open lines and achieve immediate attacks; what we speak of here is the establishment of lon ger-term compensation in the form of some po sitional advantage (a great outpost square, two bishops, long-term pressure down a file, etc.). As for the early part of this century, the issue can only be resolved by a study of the games of Tarrasch, Lasker, Capablanca and the other top masters of their day. A number of modem tech niques are missing from their play (witness the paucity of positional exchange sacrifices, for example); but one of the most extreme dispari ties arises in this area of the positional pawn sacrifice. As far as I can tell, Alekhine was the first to sacrifice pawns regularly for long-term compensation, although his inclinations were to do so for attack and initiative, somewhat as Kasparov is inclined to do today. In contemporary chess, players have become expert at grabbing pawns and then suffering un der the opponent's pressure until the time comes when they can present their bill and cash in. See, for example, my comments in Part 1, Chapter 2 on pawn-grabbing in the opening. Thus it is all the more impressive with what lack of guarantees the same players are willing to sacrifice a pawn for remarkably little imme diate compensation. A simple example is the BenkoNolga Gambit (along with the host of re lated ...b5 sacrifices in various Queen's Pawn openings). Let's talk about 1 d4 ti:Jf6 2 c4 c5 3 d5 b5 (the Benko Gambit) 4 cxb5 a6 5 bxa6 i.xa6 (D). w On move three, Black (already a half-move behind, remember) hands White a pawn. The strange part, as any student of the Benko knows, is that he often doesn't begin to recover his material or even make concrete threats until 15-20 moves or more later! Stranger still, White has no weaknesses, just a passive outlook on the queenside in the face of Black's two semi open files and the dangerous g7-bishop. We could talk about how this is possible for a long time, but two factors seem paramount to me: a) It turns out that Black has superior devel opment, in the broader sense that his minor pieces and rooks all can be transferred to effec tive posts; the same cannot be said for White, who finds it partiCularly awkward even to de velop the queen's rook and bishop without cre ating weaknesses; b) White's extra pawn resides in the two (a and b-pawns) versus one (c-pawn) on the queenside. If either of these pawns were to move, quite serious weaknesses would be cre ated, and Black's compensation as he swarms over the queenside would be obvious. But if the a- and b-pawns stay where they are, White's 'majority' is useless. In fact, White already has a passed pawn, but this is a very interesting case of a modern prin ciple pointed out by Suba: that an outside passed pawn tends to be a weakness in the middlegame (more on this later). Finally, very importantly, it is in the nature of the position that White's natural form of counterplay, attack
118 SECRETS OF MODERN CHESS STRATEGY
in the centre and on the kingside by e4-e5, is extremely difficult to achieve, is often pre empted by ... e6, and in some cases, doesn't achieve much anyway. Of course, a pawn is a pawn, and White has developed a number of strategies to overcome these difficulties; but 3 ... b5 remains in the repertoire of several world-class players today. With the thousands of wonderful examples of positional pawn sacrifices to choose from, I have decided to pick some classic examples (a few from times at which such sacrifices weren't so routine), and also ones which recur often enough that the reader may well be familiar with them. This will both emphasize the non singularity of such sacrifices and cut down on the explanation necessary for the reader to un derstand them. First, a non-thematic middlegame example from a world champion: w Botvinnik - Kan USSR Ch, Moscow 1952 Euwe and Kramer remark: "In this position, nine out of ten players would move 19 l:tfd 1, in tensifying the pressure on the backward d pawn. Botvinnik selects an entirely different method." 19 e5! ! This move threatens lbe4 (or Bxc6 and lbe4), but it sacrifices a pawn: 19 .. .'ir'c5 20 'it'd2 'it'xeS 21 Bxc6 dxc6 22 %:tel 'it'fS 23 g4! The queen has to be driven to a square on which White's lbe4 will come with tempo. 23 ... 'it'f3 24 l:.e3 'it'f6 25 l:.d7 Here is the point. A rook on the seventh will not only create middlegame threats, but will win a number of endgames. 25 ... l:.fd8 26 l:.ed3 l:txd7 27 l:.xd7 lbe8 28 lbe4 'it'f3 29 'ii' d4+ �g8 30 lbg5 c5 31 lDxf3 cxd4 32 b3 White has a large and probably decisive ad vantage, although Black should now have tried 32 ... lbf6! (instead of 32 ... l:.c8?) 33 l:txd4 l:tb7 34 lbe5 g5 35 �g2 �f8 36 l:.d8+, when Euwe says "and Black cannot move a finger to help himself', but at least he could play on. Of the old masters, perhaps only Alekhine (who was thoroughly modern in dynamic situa tions) could have been counted upon to play 19 e5 here, in my opinion. In modern times, one can imagine any number of players doing so, certainly champions like Tal, Fischer, and Kasparov; but also today's attacking players such as Shirov, Topalov, Polgar, and in fact, just about any of today's leading players. A typical positional pawn sacrifice involves the occupation of a key central square. Sham kovich calls these 'blockading sacrifices' and offers this older (but modern!) example: w Boleslavsky - Lisitsyn USSR Ch, Leningrad 1956 Boleslavsky, by the way, was one of the ear liest and most imaginative proponents of mod ern pragmatism (consider his ... e5 move in the Sicilian, leaving the d-pawn backward on an open file, and his many ideas in the King's In dian Defence, just for starters). In the diagram, both Boleslavsky and Sharnkovich missed that 15 lbc7! (pointed out by Graham Burgess)

threatens i.b5 and safely wins material. But in a way, this is lucky, because Boleslavsky treats us to a nice positional sacrifice instead: 15 c4!? i.xc4 16 tt:lc3 'Wi'b3 17 i.xc4 'ii' xc4 18 i.g5 'ii' e6 19 i.xf6 'ii' xf6 20 tLldS White's knight is not only magnificently placed on d5, but it can't be challenged. Note the bad black bishop as well. The conclusion of the game demonstrates the power of one domi nant piece: 20 .•• 'ii' h4 21 'iWe2 i.f8 22 'ii' n l:tac8 23 g3 'figS 24 h4 'ii' b6 25 g4 g5 26 hxg5 'ii' xg5 27 l:th5 'ii' g6 28 g5 h6 29 lbh6! 'iWxgS 30 .:.hS! 1-0 Since the h- and g-files will decide after 'ir'hl and l:tgl. A simple example, and not unique to modern times. However, a fair observer of the pre-1935 and current eras would have to admit how much more common such sacrifices for squares are today. Here's another Botvinnik example, a typ ical pawn sacrifice to secure superior piece play: Botvinnik - Pomar Varna Olympiad 1962 White had clearly already planned his next move: 12 e5! fxe5 13 f5 i.f7 14 tt:le4 For a mere pawn, White has achieved a su perb outpost on e4 and a devastating bishop on the long diagonal. Those two advantages are generally worth at least a pawn, but in addition, his cl-bishop has been liberated, and moves like f6 and 'ir'g4 are in the air. From Black's point of view, his d6-bishop is suddenly very bad, and his knights have few prospects. 14 ... O-O-O 15 'ilr'g4 Shamkovich stops here and says that White has an overwhelming position, which is no over statement, in my opinion. The game continued: 1S ... <jo>b8 16 'ii' xg7 i.hS Now instead of 17 l:tf2?, both 17 tt:lxd6 'ir'xd6 18 f6 and 17 f6 were practically winning on the spot. Sometimes the compensation is more long term. Here's a slightly older example of the same sacrifice: Kotov - Gligoric Candidates tournament, Zurich 1953 The same position, but this time colours are reversed and so Black has one fewer piece out than White did in the previous example. And in fact, in all of these examples, it's interesting that several of the sacrificing player's pieces are not yet out! The point is that it's the e5-square and the respective mobility of both sides' pieces that count. At any rate, instead of a winning ad vantage, Gligoric obtained longer-term play: ll ...e4! 12 fxe4 f4 13 i.f2 tt:ld7 14 tt:lg1! 'figS 15 i.n tt:les 16 tt:lf3 Re7 17 tt:lxe5 Rxe5
18 O-O-O
The difference between this and the last ex ample is clear: Black has no immediate attack. But he can prepare the break ... b5, whereas White lacks positive things to do (note espe cially his miserable light-squared bishop). 18 ... tt:lf6 19 h3 i.d7 20 i.d3 a6 21 tt:lb1! f3! The reason I chose this example. After 2l...b5 22 tt:ld2 White would be ready for tt:lf3 and would stand better. So again, Black gives

up a pawn to keep control of the dark-square complex: 22 gxf3 ltJhs 23 liJd2 liJf4 24 �n bS White, utterly tied down, had to defend tena ciously for many moves. Black was better, de spite the two-pawn deficit, a draw eventually resulting. This manoeuvre (e5, meeting ... fxe5 by f5 or, from Black's point of view, ... e4, answering fxe4 with ... f4) has become so commonplace in modern times that to someone like Kasparov, it must seem as natural as recapturing a piece! In fact, he will play such ideas under less favour able circumstances: Gheorghiu - Kasparov Thessaloniki Olympiad 1988 15 ...e4!? 16 liJxh5 ltJxh5 17 fxe4 f4 18 �f2 This time, there's no knight coming to e5, and White has more resources: 18 ... �g4 19 h3! A thematic subvariation is 19 �e2 �xe2! 20 'ii' xe2 f3! 21 gxf3 liJf4, sacrificing another pawn for more dark-square control. Kasparov then gives 22 'ii' d2 ltJg2+ 23 �fl liJh4 24 �xh4 ifxh4 25 �e2 l:txf3! with an attack. 19 ... �d7 20 O-O-O �e5 Not as good a piece for e5 as a knight, per haps, but still effective. 21 �b1 'ii" f6 22 �e2 ltJg3 Black has a bind and compensation in the form of the powerful long diagonal. The further course of the game demonstrates his practical chances, although I think that it's only equal at this stage: 23 �xg3 fxg3 24 �f3 l:tac8 25 ltJe2 'ii' g6?! ... .l:!.c5 would transpose to the game, with out allowing White options on his 27th and 28th moves. 26 l::. cl l:.xcl+ 27 'ii' xc1?! l:.c8 28 'ii' e3?!

Kasparov calls this clearly better for Black, but in fact 30 l:.c 1 �xh3 31 l:.xc5 dxc5 32 'it'e3! would now maintain the balance. 30 liJcl? �f4 31 'ilt'b4 �b5 32 liJb3 �d3+ 33 �a1 l:tc2 34 l:.b1 �e5 35 liJcl �xb2+ 36 'ilt'xb2 'ii' xb2+! 0-1 Kasparov has also employed a popular little transformation which is similar in spirit to the one above. That is e5, meeting ... dxe5 by f5, in Benoni and King's Indian positions (there's an example coming in a second). This is so stan dard now, especially in the so-called Taimanov Benoni ( 1 d4 liJf6 2 c4 c5 3 d5 e6 4 ltJc3 exd5 5 cxd5 d6 6 e4 g6 7 f4 �g7 8 �b5+) and in the Benonis with �d3 and ltJge2, that no one pays much notice. But such an idea was quite un known in the 1920s or 1930s. lt's rather inter esting, in fact, to do a database search on this idea (using the ChessBase 'manoeuvre search'). The first example I can find (in a sound form) is from 1953(!): w Zagoriansky - Kasparian Rostov-on-Don 1953 Black has just played 17 ... b5, but White crashes through: 18 e5! dxe5 19 f5! gxf5 20 ltJxfS �xf5 21 'it'xrs b4 22 ltJe4 f6 23 d6 White has an enormous positional advan tage.

To this day, White wins similar games in the same varia tion! Nowadays, the e5/ ... dxe5/f5 sacrifice pops up in the strangest places, notably in the Sicil ian and even in the Nimzo- and Queen's Indian. Here's a top-level example, with the e4-square again being critical: Vusupov - Timman Candidates match (game 5), Tilburg 1986

Let's turn to another positional sacrifice which is now part and parcel of modern prac tice. In the Griinfeld Defence, there is a standard pawn sacrifice for open lines and light-square control on the queenside. Here's an early exam ple: Garcia Vera - Bolbochan Mar del Plata 1952

Even easier for Black was a game a few years later: Sliwa-Pachman, Moscow 1956, which deviated from the game above on move 8: 8 lDe2 lDc6 9 O-O b6 10 l:tb1 i.b7 11 i.a3 lDa5 12 i.b3 'ili'd7 13 f4 c5! 14 dxc5 l:tfd8 15 i.c2 'ikc7 16 'ii' e1 lDc4! 17 cxb6 axb6 18 i.c1 lDa3 19 i.xa3 lha3 20 e5 l:txa2 21 i.b3 l:tad2 22 l:tf2 e6 23 l:f.d1 l:f.xd1 24 i.xd1 g5 25 fxg5 'fixeS 26 h4 ir'e3 27 'ii' fl l:td2 28 �h1 :.xd1 0-1.

Of course, that piece turns out to be pre cariously placed on a3 due to the open a-file and ... tiJc4. Jumping into slightly more recent times, a positionally crisp example was seen in Pribyl Uhlmann, Brno 1975 in the same line: 8 ltJe2 ltJc6 9 .te3 b6 10 O-O .tb7 11 .:.c1 e6 12 'ifd2 tiJa5 13 i.d3 c5 14 dxc5 'ifc7! 15 cxb6 axb6

'it'c7! Here, since 14 cxb6 axb6 gives Black two open files versus enemy isolated pawns and beautiful squares for his knights ( ... tt:la5-c4/b3 is an immediate consideration), Shirov de clined the offer by 14 'ii' f4 e5 15 'iit' g4 O-O 16 �f2. only to accept under worse circumstances following 16 ... tt:la5! 17 cxb6 'iit' xb6+! 18 �e3 'ii' c6! 19 .l:.hdl tt:lc4 with tremendous pressure (if the bishop moves, ...

In view of the number of openings in which this sacrifice can arise, it is remarkable that a ChessBase search couldn't unearth a single ex ample of it in play all the way up to 1935! (There was one lone consultation game with Alekhine as Black in which dxc5, cxb6 and ... axb6 oc curred, but material remained even). One can hardly explain this without accepting that a fun damental conceptual change has come about since that time. Sticking with 'standard' sacrifices for a mo ment, some of these positional pawn sacrifices are discovered in home analysis and then dis puted for years over the board. Such is the case with lines like Polugaevsky's invention in the Queen's Indian: 1 d4 tt:lf6 2 c4 e6 3 tt:lf3 b6 4 g3 i.b7 5 i.g2 i.e7 6 O-O O-O 7 d5!? exd5 8 tt:lh4 c6 9 cxd5 tt:lxd5 10 tt:lf5, with obscure compli cations which are still being debated nearly 20 years after its introduction. Although the cre ativity of such moves might be called into ques tion by the fact that they are worked out at home, we can still see a very modem spirit here. After all, Black has no weaknesses and White has just given up a centre pawn! It just happens that his active pieces and the peculiarities of the

Space is lacking to do justice to the variety of modern pawn sacrifices. Sometimes these are based upon a combination of advantages (e.g., development and control of colour complexes) rather than upon direct attack or enemy weak nesses. Witness, for example, Adorjan's idea in the Nimzo-Indian: 1 d4 tZ:lf6 2 c4 e6 3 tZ:lc3 i.b4
4 Rc2 O-O 5 a3 �xc3+ 6 'ii'
xc3 b5!? (D). This is a sacrifice which not all masters fully trust, but is still scoring well at the time of writ ing. Again, White has no serious weaknesses; Black just wants to develop as rapidly as possi ble after 7 cxb5 c6. If White captures on c6, Black will take with the knight and quickly get a rook to the c-file. Note especially the light squares controlled by the knight on f6 and bishop on b7. In some cases, ... tZ:la5! will fur ther target c4 and b3. This attempt to control a particular colour complex is quite typical of modern pawn sacrifices. Without going into the theory, an attempt to contest those light squares by 8 f3 is considered too slow, e.g., 8 ... tZ:ld5 9 'i!i'd2 f5 10 tZ:lh3 cxb5 11 e3 tZ:lc6 12 �xb5 tZ:la5 13 'ii' d3 .l:tb8 14 b4 .l:txb5! with scads of play, based upon 15 'ii' xb5 tZ:lb3 16 l:b1 'ii' h4+! 17 tZ:lf2 tZ:lxc1 18 .:xcl tZ:lxe3 with ongoing attack, S.Mohr-Christiansen, Bundesliga 1989/90. Every one of the world's top players today uses the positional pawn sacrifice. Garry Kas parov, true to his reputation, tends to impart them with an particular emphasis on activity. His sacrifices don't always lead to mating at tacks or forced combinations, however. Often, compensation for the pawn will come in the form of a sustained initiative based upon supe rior overall piece placement. To conclude this section, let's see two Kasparov examples in which this initiative prevails even in positions without queens: Timman - Kasparov Reykjavik 1988

Thus, Black was clearly better at this point, and went on to win. It is important to note that from move 15 on ward, Black's conception depended upon a re markable string of difficult tactics, since White has critical options on every move; see Kaspar ov's notes in lnformator 54 for the details. This is so very typical of the concrete, analytical ap proach Kasparov advocates. In most top-flight contemporary games, one cannot expect the game to be decided by one side achieving static, obvious advantages and then driving them home with good technique. Rather, one has to be able to anticipate correctly that, of the con flicting possibilities for both sides, the oppo nent's will fade and one's own will triumph. This is a matter of intuition to some extent, but more so, a matter of good preparation and supe rior over-the-board analysis. With this game, we end our discussion of the positional pawn sacrifice. But the chapters which follow will contain further examples of this integral part of modern chess. Are Your Pawns Really Backward? We next turn our attention to the subject of backward pawns on open files and the holes as sociated with them. Euwe/Kramer and Pach man have similar definitions of a backward pawn, the latter calling it "a pawn which has been left behind by neighbouring pawns and can no longer be supported by them." Euwe and Kramer say that such a pawn "is almost invari ably a serious disadvantage. It is the square in front of the pawn which causes all the trouble", a revealing comment which serves to illustrate older attitudes on this subject; 'invariably' and 'serious' are rather strong terms, and I can't think that any modern master would agree with this statement. Pachman also simply assumes
126 SECRETS OF MODERN CHESS STRATEGY
that such pawns are bad, saying, e.g., "Here is a simple example of this: 1 e4 c5 2 tLlf3 tLlc6 3 d4 cxd4 4 lLlxd4 lLlf6 5 lLlc3 e6 6 tLldb5 d6(?) 7 i.f4! e5 8 i.g5 and Black has a backward pawn." This position, of course, is one of the most popular Sicilian V ariations in today' s chess, used extensively by Kramnik as Black, for example. Times have changed! There is another curious aspect of these au thors' presentation and that of most traditional middlegame books. Such books tend to be shamelessly imitative in their choice of subject matter, and for some reason, devote consider able attention to backward pawn structures such as ... d6/ ... e5 (without a black c-pawn, and with an open white d-file, as in several Sicilians like the Najdorf and Sveshnikov); but they spend little (or in some cases, no) time on the structures like ... d6/ ... e6 (also without a black c-pawn, and with an open d-file), which occurs in many Sicilian systems (Maroczy Bind, Scheveningen, etc.). This extremely popular structure (the white c-pawn can be at c2 or c4) also arises in the var ious Hedgehog openings, and a similar one, ... c6/ ...d6 without a black e-pawn, occurs in the King's Indian Defence and some double e pawn openings. Euwe calls the d-pawn 'semi backward' in such cases. This pawn configura tion does not cede the square in front of the d6 weakness, and there is more potential of a free ing advance ( ... d5). Nevertheless, the d6-pawn is still a pawn on an open file, unsupported by its comrades on neighbouring files, and as such, its routine adoption in today's chess deserves attention. A little historical overview might be interest ing here. I have run extensive searches for typi cal backward pawn structures in ChessBase. (For the record, these searches were conducted up to move 20, with the relevant pawn structure then required to stay intact for at least 8 half moves.) Black's ...d6/. .. e5 backward pawn (open c-file for Black, open d-file for White, as in the Sicilian) occurred in only 0.4% of the games between 1900 and 1935, many of those being 'non-thematic' cases (in a double e-pawn open ing, for example, White captures a piece on d6 and Black responds ...cxd6). In the beginning years of what I call 'modern' chess, 1936-65, this percentage rises dramatically to 2.7%, and in succeeding years, rises to 3.25% (most of them Sicilians). That's a hefty number of games in which Black is willing to take on an 'almost invariably serious' disadvantage! To cite an other example, the figures for the analogous ... e6/ ... d5 structure (open f-file for Black, open e-file for White - a French Defence with exf6/ ... tLlxf6, for example) are 0.32% for the 1900-1935 period (mostly non-thematic), ris ing to 0.77% today (practically all of them French Defences). There has been, then, an al most six-fold increase in Black's willingness to take on one of these two structures. A similar search for ... d6/...c6 structures (open black e-file, open white d-file) reveals that modern players enter such positions about twice as often as pre-1935 players, whereas the Sicilian ... d6/ ...e6 structure (open black c-file, open white d-file) is almost four times as fre quent as in 1900-1935 (6.1% to 1.5% ). Interest ingly, Black's results with this structure have always been better than his overall results: 51%-49% in White's favour for 1900-1935 (with a relatively small sample), and 52%-48% in modern times. Thus, it appears that the d6 weakness is more than compensated for by other factors, a point Kasparov seems well aware of! Finally, the traditional example of a truly problematic backward pawn, ...c6/ ... d5 with no b-pawn, and with White having a pawn on d4 and open c-file (arising from the Exchange Slav, Queen's Gambit Exchange Variation after b4-b5 and b5xc6, and certain Tarrasch Queen's Gambits, among others), has remained fairly constant in frequency of appearance since 1900-1935.
MODERN PAWN PLAY 127
But the results are quite revealing: 50%-50% for 1900-1935 (with a small sample, however) and 56%-44% since then. Compare this with the 55%-45% for all games today! Thus, even with this most maligned of backward pawns ( ...c6/ ... d5 with an open white c-file and pawn on d4) Black doesn't seem to pay much of a price in results. If you include an advanced black b-pawn on b5 or b4 and a white pawn on b2, by the way, there are an increased number of modern occurrences, but the winning per centages remain the same. The two indications we get from the above statistics are: a) that modern players are more willing to take on backward pawns, although this mostly happens in particular openings with known characteristics; b) backward pawns are in general less of a disadvantage than classical theory would imag ine, and in some cases, no disadvantage at all. Let's talk about why for a moment. To their credit, Euwe and Kramer acknowledged the changing times: "In recent years, some opening lines have been developed (e.g., 1 e4 c5 2 ltJf3 ltJc6 3 d4 cxd4 4 ltJxd4 ltJf6 5 ltJc3 d6 6 i.e2 e5 (D)) which seem to laugh at all theory. Even the semi-backward pawn in the King's Indian (1 d4 ltJf6 2 c4 g6 3 g3 i.g7 4 i.g2 O-O 5 ltJc3 d6 6 e4 ltJbd7 7 ltJge2 e5 8 O-O exd4 9 ltJxd4 l:te8 10 h3 ltJc5 1 1 _.c2 a5 12 i.e3 c6!) is enough to make certain theorists of yesterday turn in their graves ... this reappraisal of the backward pawn can be seen as one aspect of the new trend of thought which has been pervading chess since the Second World War ... a new dynamic style has emerged, with the Russian school its chief advocates. This school puts the accent chiefly on the play of the pieces, their activity being sufficient to compensate for the weakness of the backward pawn." Pachman, speaking of the first (diagramm ed) example, lists the ideas behind 6 ... e5: a) control of d4 and f4, including preventing White from occupying d4; b) preventing the dangerous e5; c) preparing a "speedy development ( ... i.e7, ...i.e6), and one, moreover, in which he has control of d5"; d) "Often [Black] succeeds in playing ... d5 ... If White seeks to prevent this, he must gener ally occupy the square d5 with a knight and, af ter Black exchanges the piece, retake with his e-pawn; the result is then a superiority on the king side for Black ..." e) "It is interesting to note that Black's oper ations on the c-file are mostly more effective than White's on the d-file, for the pawn on d6 protected by the bishop is a great barrier for White." With regard to this last point 'e', I should quote the ultra-modern rebel Suba: "bad bish ops protect good pawns!". This is a rather shock ing (if not universal) principle; in our Sicilian example, I might even modify the principle to "bad bishops protect bad pawns, but for good reasons!" More on this subject of bad bishops later. Let's move to a few examples. I should say that the textbooks are very disappointing in this regard. They tend to show some thoroughly one-sided position with an unchallengeable
128 SECRETS OF MODERN CHESS STRATEGY
knight on d5 for White versus a backward d6- pawn; then, just to rub it in, Black usually has two other weaknesses or an exposed king, and w no active play whatsoever! This is a good ex ample of what Suba complains about when he says that "classical strategy presupposes that you play with much weaker (or much stron- ger!) opponents." Real chess life requires more subtlety. Let's look at a recent example of the one of the oldest ... e5 Sicilian lines: Kasparov - Gelfand Linares 1997
1 e4 c5 2 �f3 d6 3 d4 cxd4 4 �xd4 �f6 5
�c3 a6 6 �e2 e5 7 �b3 i.. e7 8 O-O O-O 9 'iii> h1 b6! ? Gelfand's invention, and the latest wrinkle in this variation. Black's idea is that ... b5 allows a4, meeting ... b4 with �d5 in many lines, creat ing queenside weaknesses. Of course, ...b5 is still desirable, but Black wants to cover d5 first. 10 i..g5 See Pachman's list above of Black's ideas in the ... d6/ ... e5 structure. If White plays slowly, Black can cover d5 and keep the advantages listed there. For example, Anand-Gelfand, Dos Hermanas 1997 continued 10 �e3 i..b7 11 f3 b5 (a tempo down, but in a position where a knight on d5 can be exchanged to establish a kingside majority, a la Pachman) 12 a4 b4 13 �d5 �xd5 14 exd5 �d7 15 c3 bxc3 16 bxc3 i..g5 17 i..g1 'ikc7 18 c4 a5 19 �d2 f5 and Black had full equality.

This contest followed the overall outlines of many recent Sveshnikov Sicilian games, which features the same ... d6/ ... e5 structure. In those games, White achieves a slight positional edge, and Black sacrifices a pawn in order to trade into a drawn opposite-colour bishop ending. See any number of Kramnik Sveshnikov games for examples. The analogous French Defence situation tends to be more dynamic, for example, after 1 e4 e6 2 d4 d5 3 �d2 �f6 4 e5 �fd7 5 i..d3 cS 6 c3 �c6 7 �e2 1r'b6 8 �f3 cxd4 9 cxd4 f6 10 exf6 �xf6 11 O-O i..d6 (D). Let's make a comparison with the ... d6/ ... e5 Sicilian line above, using Pachrnan's list: a) The d5-pawn covers c4 and e4, similar to the role of the e5-pawn in the Sicilian ver sion;
MODERN PAWN PLAY 129
w b) As opposed to the prevention of e5 in the Sicilian, prevention of the move d5 already oc curred on move two! c) The development ... i.d7/ ... i.d6 mirrors that of ... i.e7/ ... i.e6 in the Sicilian, and here, the control of e5 resembles control of d5 in that case; d) Often Black succeeds in playing ... e5, freeing his game (for example, after 12 a3 O-O
13 b4 e5! ), just as Black plays the freeing ...d5
in the Sicilian case. If White tries to prevent the advance ... e5 with tt::l e5, Black can often play ... i.xe5, meeting dxe5 by ... ti:ld7 or ... tt::l g4 with a favourable change of pawn structure. In the Sicilian example, capture on d5 normally leads to a quick ... f5 and mobilization of Black's kingside majority; no analogous situation ex ists in the French. But it is also more difficult for White to play tt::l e5 at all, because his d pawn tends to hang; e) Here, attack on the f-file (achieved in one move after ... O-O, by the way) tends to be more effective than White's along the e-file, but for different reasons than in the ... d6/ ... e5 structure. For one thing, White's .l:f.e1 would leave f2 dan gerously weak ( ... tt::l g4 and ... e5 both empha size this point), whereas defence of c2 was not a major issue in the Sicilian case. But the idea that the d7-bishop makes the e6-pawn a great barrier to White (as the e7-bishop and d6-pawn did in the Sicilian) really isn't as true here, be cause White can play llc1 and tt::l a4-c5 (with or without b4) and put great pressure on Black's interior defences. As a result, the whole nature of Black's 'compensation' for his backward pawn is rather different here, depending upon the activity of his pieces. In fact, the bishop on d7 will often abandon its post as the loyal guard to e6 and drift, via e8, to the kingside at g6 or h5. Let us now follow a thematic game: 12 tt::l c3 Lucke - Kindermann Altensteig 1989 To emphasize the point about the move .l:f.e1 and the f-file, here's an example with White's next most popular move, 12 i.d2: 12
... O-O 13
i.c3 i.d7 14 tt::l g3 i.f4 (to be able to answer tt::l e5 with ... tt::l xe5 and not shut out this bishop) 15 .l:te1 !? (risky) 15. . .<it>h8 16 i.c2 l:tae8 (the d7-bishop here indeed plays the role of loyal defender of e6, as in the Sicilian situation) 17 b4 tt::l g4 18 'ii' d3 g6 19 h3? ti:lxf2! 20 �xf2 e5, and Black's attack was overwhelming in Sul man-J.Watson, Lone Pine 1981. 12 ...

(D)
B
A good point to take stock. It's hard to argue with White's strategy. His pieces are all out, and his rooks have occupied the only open files. Black's next move emphasizes the difference between his backward pawn and the Sicilian d6-pawn. Instead of relying on Suba's 'bad bishops defend good pawns!', he prefers 'bad bishops are bad!' as a guiding principle, and de cides to rectify that difficulty.

But White's kingside has been weakened, and Black is now mobilized. On 19 lt:Jxf7+ l:.xf7, Black's only problem piece would be gone, and he would be ready to attack along the f-file. 19 'ii' d2 i.g8 20 i.b1 'ii' d8 This prepares ... e5, which White can't do much to stop, now that f4 is unplayable. 21 �g2 a6 22 tt:Je2 e5 23 dxeS tt:JxeS 24 b3 tt:Jc6 After 24. ..h6!, Black probably didn't like the look of 25 h4 hxg5 26 hxg5 ti:Jxf3 27 gxf6!, but then 27 ... ti:Jh4+! retains a clear edge. 25 i.cS i.xcS 26 l:lxcS d4 White's weaknesses (especially e3) begin to look serious.

Black could hold the balance by 29 ... 'ike7 30 lt:Jg6+! hxg6 31 'ii' xg4 'ii' e2+ etc.; but he wants more. 30 tt:Jge6 i.xe6 31 tt:Jxe6 'ii' e7 32 tt:Jxf8 'ii' xc5 33 ti:Jg6+ ?? Of course, 33 'i'xg7+! would have given White a clear advantage, but who knows what the time situation was?

Turning to 'semi-backward' pawns, we find that modern chess is riddled with these, mainly stemming from the Sicilian Defence ( ...d6/... e6). Since even club players are rather overexposed to the themes of Kasparov's favourite opening set-up, I'd like to investigate some very similar Hedgehog positions instead. But first, let's look at a skeletal position: w I have intentionally left the queens and two knights off, although normally they would still be on the board. A traditional discussion of this position would (a) conclude that White was better due to his space advantage, and (b) sug gest that White should play ti:Jd5, to exert un comfortable pressure on Black. Then, if Black plays ... e6 to drive away the knight, the return of the knight to c3 is said to give White the ad vantage due to the weakness on d6. In some Si cilian Defences, this sort of manoeuvre would also be recommended in a position with only White's e-pawn on e4, and the other pawns on their original squares. In modern chess, however, we often find that Black has voluntarily placed his pawns on e6 and d6 in such positions, without any time consuming provocation by White! To make this tempo comparison worse, Black often begins with the king's bishop on e7, then plays ...
O-O,
... l:le8, ... i.f8, and sometimes can even afford the further luxury of ...g6 and ... i.g7! In the Si cilian, this type of set-up arises in the Kan (1 e4 c5 2 ti:Jf3 e6 3 d4 cxd4 4 ti:Jxd4 a6) and Taimanov (1 e4 c5 2 tbf3 e6 3 d4 cxd4 4 tbxd4 tbc6) variations, or in certain Scheveningen lines. But it is the Symmetrical English opening which has given rise to the purest Hedgehog positions most often, via 1 c4 c5 2 ti:Jf3 ti:Jf6, and now, for example, 3 d4 cxd4 4 tt:Jxd4 b6 5 tlJc3 i.b7 or, more frequently, via 3 g3 b6 4 i.g2 i.b7 5 O-O e6 6 tbc3 i.e7 7 d4 cxd4 8 'it'xd4 d6 (or some variant thereof). Here's an example of the former:

Suba talks about this as the problem of a 'good position which can't be improved' versus 'a bad position that can be substantially improved'. White's pieces are in a sense ideally placed, preventing Black's coun terplay and 'fixing' the weaknesses on b6 and d6, but almost any committal move he makes (b4, liJc2, liJb3) allows Black to free his game. For his part, Black is stuck on the first three ranks, but has continuous threats of breaking out with advantage via ...b5 or ... d5, and lack ing those, can proceed to improve the position of his pieces.

There are two things I like about this exam ple: a) White has no weaknesses, and steadfastly refuses to make any (e.g. g3 or h3), and yet his opponent, operating from far away on the other side of the board on his first two ranks(!), cre ated enough threats to break down White's po sition anyway; b) the remarkable manoeuvre ..

Books would give ex amples of classic victories by the greats (Bot vinnik and Smyslov in particular) to drive this lesson home. To quote from my own English Opening book: "White's strategy in these cir cumstances was supposed to be straightfor ward: establish a bind on Black's two freeing moves, ... b5 and ... d5. With more space to work with, White could more rapidly shift his forces from one side to another, eventually forcing new weaknesses or material gain." But (as it turned out) the difficulty in shifting those forces without allowing a black freeing move leads to the situation described below the last diagram, in which White is as much tied up by Black's latent activity as Black is tied up by White's space advantage! Thus, due to the spe cial insight of a few players (Andersson, Kar pov, Psakhis, and leading Hungarian players, for example), the Hedgehog became a standard and legitimate part of modern opening theory. In fact, in modern practice White tends to avoid the advance e4 in such positions, in favour of piece play. To complete our backward pawn discussion, here's a 'pure' Hedgehog from the fairly early days. It involves a positional pawn sacrifice for play on the dark squares. Uhlmann - Adorjan Budapest 1982

The New Relationship of Flank to Centre This is a broad topic which I will only touch upon here, but should be implicit in the chap ters which follow. Traditionally, one of the firmest principles of chess has been that flank attacks are to be countered by attacks in the centre. Furthermore, launching a flank attack before stabilizing the central situation has been considered a cardinal chess sin, partaken of only by beginners. Related to this is another idea, expressed by Nimzowitsch as follows: " ... pawn moves are only admissible in the development stage when they either help to oc cupy the centre, or stand in logical connection with its occupation; that is to say, a pawn move which protects its own or attacks the enemy centre . . . it follows that moves of the flank pawns must be regarded as loss of time; with this qualification, that in closed games the rule applies only to a limited extent ... Hence, as Lasker truly observes [in the context of open games, to be sure - JW]: in the opening, one or two pawn moves, not more." These principles have been considerably re laxed in modern times. Without going into great detail, I would like to point out a few ex amples of the type of flank play which does not depend upon complete development or an ex ceptionally stable centre. To address Nimzo witsch's statement, let's examine some flank advances in the opening, taken from recent play. On the kingside, the moves g4 and h4 (and ...g5 and ...h5) are seen in a variety of modern contexts. Here's an invention by Shabalov which has captured the attention of leading grandmasters (and continues to be played after years of analysis):
1 d4 d5 2 c4 c6 3 l2Jc3 lDf6 4 e3 e6 5 l2Jf3
liJbd7 6 'iWc2 ..Bd6 7 g4!? (D)
B
It only took 70 years or so to discover this move! The tactical point is that 7 ... l2Jxg4 8 .:tg 1 either recovers the pawn or leads to a terrific at tack. The positional one is either to drive the f6-knight away, and then play for e4, or to force some kind of weakening such as ... h6 on Black's part. Then White can castle queenside and attack the weakness. Black has several re plies, but a popular and logical one is ... 7 ... h6 Now if g5 is ever played, Black gets the h file. In the meantime, he reasons that the g4- pawn sticks out like a sore thumb. 8 ..Bd2 We shall now follow a game where Black tried a classical response to White's idea: 8 ... e5?! Krivoshei - Feigin Ukrainian Ch 1995 Better is 8 ... 'iWe7 or 8 ... dxc4, but I want to look at this move. After all, aren't flank attacks supposed to be met by counterattacks in the centre? 9 cxd5 cxd5 Perhaps 9 ... l2Jxd5 was better, but after 10 O-O-O, White keeps alive his options of e4, l2Je4 or in some cases l2Jxd5, with good prospects.

There was no pro found objection to 8 ... e5?!; it simply didn't work because White's attack was too strong. Naturally, such a central counter-thrust would be even less effective had White already played O-O-O, so one can tentatively conclude that the classical objection to 7 g4 is not operative here. Of course, Black may discover other methods which render 7 g4 harmless or even unsatisfac tory, but that's another issue. Sticking with g4 for a moment, here's an even stranger version of the same idea: Krasenkow - Gild. Garcia FIDE KO Wch, Groningen 1997 1 tt'lf3 tt'lf6 2 c4 e6 3 tt'lc3 3Lb4 4 g4!? (D) As Krasenkow says: "A novelty on move 4 in a thoroughly developed opening? Unbeliev able!" 4 g4 was apparently discovered inde pendently by Zviagintsev and Krasenkow.

The story of g4 in the Sicilian is a remark able one. Every year, it seems that White finds a new'(and earlier!) context in which to play this move; and it would be fair to say that the revival of White's chances versus the Sicilian Defence on the top levels can be largely attributed to var ious innovations involving g4. In fact, one could write an entertaining book entitled "g4 in 1990s Sicilian Defences" and be swamped by the choice of material. With respect to theories of central and flank play, the interesting thing to note is that in many cases White makes this move well before one would consider his development complete or the central situation stable.
MODERN PAWN PLAY 135
To begin with the most obvious and early ex ample, consider the Keres Attack:
1 e4 cS 2 li:Jf3 d6 3 d4 cxd4 4 lt:Jxd4 li:Jf6 5
lt:Jc3 e6 6 g4 (D)
B
This is now such an established weapon that we forget how strange it seemed when Keres and others first employed it. White has only two pieces out, but prefers to forego further de velopment until he can drive the enemy knight away by g5. Failing that (in the case of 6 ... h6), he has gained space, discouraged ... O-O, and may even use the g4 move to play .1g2. Need less to say, in view of the standard dogma about such flank pawn moves, many early games fea tured the central counterattack 6 ... d5?!, which, however, led to a clear advantage for White af ter 7 exd5 lt:Jxd5 8 .1b5+ .1d7 9 li:Jxd5 exd5 10 'ike2+ .1e7 (10 ...

clearly worse. There is no guarantee that a move such as 6 ... d5 won't work in such situa tions; in fact it might have been the best reply had White played another order, say, 6 .1e2 (in stead of 6 g4) 6 ... lt:Jc6 7 g4 d5. The point is that these are analysable problems, and White shouldn't limit his weaponry based upon ab stract principles. In the Keres Attack, ultimately, Black settled upon 6 ...h6 and 6 ... lt:Jc6 as favourite replies, with 6 ... a6 a slightly riskier alternative. But in general, strong players are irritated enough by
6 g4 that they increasingly avoid it altogether
by means of other move-orders (for example, 5 ...a6 followed by ...e6 or ... e5, as used by Kasparov). In the Najdorf, 1 e4 cS 2 li:Jf3 d6 3 d4 cxd4 4 li:Jxd4 li:Jf6 S li:Jc3 a6 (a flank move, by the way, hardly justified by Black's one-piece develop ment!), White's g4 ideas have become almost routine. For example, after the popular move 6 .1e3 (D), we have: a) 6 ...e6 7 g4!?, and now, for example, 7 ... h6 8 f4 b5 9 .1g2 .1b7 10 g5 hxg5 11 fxg5 lLlh5 12 g6, as in several games, the rapidplay game Shirov-Van Wely, Monaco 1997 continu ing 12 ... li:Jf6 13 gxf7+ rJi;xf7 14 O-O lLld7 15 lt:Jxe6! rJi;xe6 16 e5 .1xg2 17 exf6 lt:Jxf6 18 �xg2 with a powerful ongoing attack. No posi tional subtleties in that one! b) The reply 6 ...e5 will not discourage someone beset with g4 fever, e.g., Shirov-Kas parov, Tilburg 1997 continued 7 li:Jb3 .1e6 8 f3 .1e7 9 'ikd2 li:Jbd7 (9 ... h5!? - a prophylactic flank move to prevent g4! - has been played with some success) 10 g4 h6 11 O-O-O b5 (more flank-versus-flank action!) 12 h4 lLlb6 13 �b1 b4 14 .1xb6 'ikxb6 15 lLld5 .1xd5 16 exd5 with a big mess. c) In view of the above, Black often goes to flank play himself by 6 ... lt:Jg4 7 .1g5 h6 8 .1h4 g5 9 .1g3 .1g7 10 .1e2 h5!? (10 ... li:Jc6 is more common). Then 11 h4 gxh4 12 l:.xh4 lt:Jc6 leaves Black with a weak h-pawn, but resolves the central situation with gain of time: 13 li:Jb3 .1e6 14 'ii' d2 'ii' b6 15 lLld5 .1xd5 16 exd5 lt:Jce5

136 SECRETS OF MODERN CHESS STRATEGY
order to achieve effective development, even in an opening so notoriously tactical as the Sicil ian. There's almost a 'pawns-before-pieces' atti tude in the following game, an example of the 'English Attack' f3/g4 structure which top players (such as Short and Anand) have used to inflict damage on the Sicilian: Kasparov - Kamsky Linares 1993
1 e4 cS 2 o!bf3 e6 3 d4 cxd4 4 o!Dxd4 .!Df6 S o!bc3
d6 6 .i.e3 a6 7 f3 o!Dbd7 8 g4 h6 9 l:tg1 'ii' b6 10 a3! .!DeS (D) l l .i.f2! Moving this piece twice achieves the goal of driving away Black's queen; this takes priority over development. l l ... 'ii' c7 12 f4 o!bc4?! 13 i.xc4 ir'xc4 14 'iff3 eS? 1S .!Drs .i.xfS 16 gxfS dS 17 fxeS o!bxe4 18 l:tg4! With a clear advantage for White. In this ex ample, it almost seemed as though White forgot that he was supposed to get his pieces out; and yet in the end, his development was superior. Finally, White can embark on a g4 adventure even when there's no target on f6, e.g., 1 e4 c5 2 o!bf3 o!bc6 3 d4 cxd4 4 o!bxd4 e6 5 o!bc3 d6 6 g4!?, as played by Karpov in 1985 and more re cently, by Shirov. One might consider this a prophylactic move, discouraging ... o!bf6, but it's interesting that even 6 ... o!bge7 can be answered by more pawn moves: 7 .i.e3 a6 8 g5 b5 9 f4 .i.b7 10 .i.g2 with an unclear position, as in Shabalov-Smirin, Los Angeles 1997. An interesting point about precisely these (but not all) Sicilian examples is that according to current theory, the response ... d5 to g4 would have been inferior. How far we have come from classical days, in which that would be consid ered the automatic punishment for such bra vado! To complete this section, let me just refer the reader to some other early flank thrusts in the openings. There are some obvious examples we don't think about, but, for example, how per fectly normal the move 6 h4 in the Caro-Kann after 1 e4 c6 2 d4 d5 3 o!bc3 dxe4 4 o!bxe4 .i.f5 5 o!bg3 .i.g6 seems to us. And yet Alekhine, com menting upon 6 o!Df3, remarks ''The formerly so popular 'attacking' move, 6 h4, which is suit able only for a knight attack [presumably he means that after ... h6, o!be5 will come with tempo - JW] and weakens the king's position without compensation, has been discarded little by little and rightly so." Of course today, by pure dint of practice, we know that the space gained on White's kingside by 6 h4 h6 7 o!Df3 o!bd7 8 h5 can be very useful indeed. As for the king, it should go queenside anyway, so that White can quickly claim the central files. Of course, hindsight is 20-20, but this idea of 'weakening flank moves' has been a powerful deterrent to some good ideas. Another Caro-Kann example occurs in the Advance Variation after 1 e4 c6 2 d4 d5 3 e5, a move which, by the way, Reuben Fine says is 'absolutely useless', since Black can play ... .i.f5, ... e6, and ... c5, with a superior version of the French Defence. If only the world's top players over the last 15 years had it so easy! Again, the pragmatic reality of concrete varia tions belies such superficial judgements. Any way,-back to 3 e5 .i.f5, White has created a certain amount of havoc (and theory is still un settled) in the line 4 o!bc3 e6 5 g4!? .i.g6 6 o!bge2, intending 6 ... c5 7 h4. Maybe, White rea sons, I can make the bishop wish it were back behind the pawn-chain! In numerous lines of the Alekhine with 1 e4 o!bf6 2 e5 o!bd5 3 d4 d6 4 o!Df3, White will find the move a4 useful, to gain space and drive a black knight from b6. One such line is 4 ...g6 5 .i.c4 o!bb6 6 .i.b3 .i.g7 7 a4 !?. Against certain fianchetto systems, h4-h5 is of course possible long before one's development

is completed. The Dutch Defence with 1 d4 f5 2 lbc3 d5 (2 ... g6?! 3 h4 lDf6 4 h5! is worse after 4 ... lbxh5 5 .l:.xh5! gxh5 6 e4 with attack, or 4 ... i.g7 5 h6 i.f8 6 i.g5 d5 7 1i'd2 e6 8 O-O-O i.b4 9 f3, as given in ECO) 3 i.g5 g6 4 h4!? i.g7 5 e3 is one example.

After 7 ... i.g6 8 h4! or 7 ... i.e6 8 h3, it turns out that White's space advantage can be very useful, as Botvinnik showed against Petrosian. Decades later, both Korchnoi and Kasparov achieved advantages versus Karpov in World Championship play with this same line, a good indication that 7 g4 has more than mere sur prise value to it. There are plenty of black examples as well. In the 1 e4 c5 2 c3 Sicilian, one of the currently popular lines goes 1 e4 c5 2 c3 lDf6 3 e5 lDd5 4 lbf3 lbc6 5 i.c4 lbb6 6 i.b3 c4 7 i.c2 1i'c7 8 1i'e2 g5!?, a purely practical device for under mining the white e-pawn. Even after 9 e6 dxe6 10 lbxg5 1i'e5, Black's apparently weakened pawns are compensated by his strong centre and active pieces. In the French Defence, the move ... g5 ap pears early on in several variations. One of the best-known of these goes 1 e4 e6 2 d4 d5 3 lbd2 lbf6 4 e5 lbfd7 5 f4 c5 6 c3 lbc6 7 liJdf3 'iir' b6 8 g3 cxd4 9 cxd4 i.b4+ 10 �f2 g5!?. This ap pears to be positional suicide on the kingside, but the idea is to compromise White's structure before he completes his development and is able to secure his space advantage. After 11 fxg5 lbdxe5, Black eliminates the crucial e pawn; otherwise, he can either open the g-file by ...gxf4 or drive back White's only developed piece by ... g4. We could fill a chapter with examples of . .. b5. A recently popular variation is the Note boom/Abrahams line of the Queen's Gambit: 1 d4 d5 2 c4 e6 3 lbc3 c6 4 lDf3 dxc4 5 a4 i.b4 6 e3 b5 7 i.d2 a5 8 axb5 i.xc3 9 i.xc3 cxb5 10 b3 i.b7 11 bxc4 b4 12 i.b2 lDf6 13 i.d3 O-O 14
O-O (D).

White is clearly on top in the centre, but Black counts on his advanced queenside passed pawns to compensate him. The status of this line is as yet unresolved. There are many such examples, some so ac cepted that we aren't quite aware how strange they might have looked just a half century ago. For example, the Griinfeld with 1 d4 lDf6 2 c4 g6 3 lbc3 d5 4 lDf3 i.g7 5 'it'b3 dxc4 6 'iir' xc4 O-O 7 e4, and now, instead of developing those queenside pieces, 7 ... a6. In fact, Black wants to move a few other pawns, too, before he deigns to bring his pieces out, e.g., 8 i.e2 b5 9 'iir' b3 c5! 10 dxc5 i.b7, a line which has served Black well. In conclusion, suffice it to say that strictures against flank advances in undeveloped posi tions are quite as limiting of the chess imagina tion as the other rules we have been discussing. Other Pawn Issues Unfortunately, there are too many new pawn structures and ideas about pawn play to do them all justice in this book. To some extent, pawn
138 SECRETS OF MODERN CHESS STRATEGY
play is inextricable from other issues, as our discussions of prophylaxis and dynamism will make clear. Nor are the differences in modern pawn play always easy to define, even when they obviously exist. The treatment of doubled pawns, for example, has probably not under gone quite the radical change we have seen in the case of pawn-chains or backward pawns. For that reason, I combined both the classical approach to doubled pawns and some new ideas about them in Part 1, Chapter 4. There we saw that players are both creating and allowing doubled pawns in a variety of situations which would have previously been thought too risky or time-consuming. For an amazing example of ultra-modem rejection of principle, I recommend going back and re-examining the lvanchuk Anand game at the end of that section. It would naturally be possible to expand upon those ideas here. In some lines of modern opening theory, for example, the acceptance of doubled pawns has become routine, e.g., Black meets i.xf6 by ... gxf6 in a number of lines of the Open Sicilian (most notably the Richter-Rauzer). Also, pawn captures away from the centre which create doubled pawns are probably more acceptable than in previous times (see, for example, the fxg3 captures after ... li:'lxg3 in the hybrid Nimzo/Queen's Indian line 1 d4 li:'lf6 2 c4 e6 3 li:'lf3 b6 4 li:'lc3 i.b4 5 i.g5 h6 6 i.h4 i.b7 7 e3 g5 8 i.g3 li:'le4 ). But to some extent, these situa tions tend to be pragmatic ones, not reflecting any new consciousness. Probably the most thematically consistent recent development with respect to doubled pawns has been their creation at the cost of the bishop-pair and considerable loss of time. Such a previously unheard-of combination of con cessions is demonstrated in such lines as: a) 1 d4 g6 2 c4 i.g7 3 li:'lc3 c5 4 d5 i.xc3+ 5 bxc3 f5!; b) 1 c4 b6 2 li:'lf3 i.b7 3 g3 i.xf3!? 4 exf3 c5; and c) 1 c4 c5 2 li:'lc3 li:'lc6 3 g3 g6 4 i.g2 i.g7 5 b3 e6 6 i.xc6!?. Consider that the Hubner Variation of the Nimzo-Indian (1 d4 li:'lf6 2 c4 e6 3 li:'lc3 i.b4 4 e3 c5 5 li:'lf3 li:'lc6 6 i.d3 i.xc3+ 7 bxc3 d6) was considered rather bold and modern just a few years ago, due to the voluntary surrender of the b4-bishop (with no loss of tempo, namely a3, on White's part). But the above efforts are more radical still; in all three cases, it takes three moves to develop and exchange the bishop ( ...g6 is not a useful move such as ... e6 was in the Nimzo-Indian, for example); and the holes left by the movement of the knight's pawn present an extra challenge for the exchanger. In view of the extremely sceptical attitude to wards the fianchetto expressed by Alekhine and others of his time, can we imagine his reac tion to such play, or worse, that of greats such as Lasker and Capablanca? Only Nimzowitsch might have an instinctive sympathy with the above examples, and it has taken chess almost 50 years to vindicate his eccentricity on such matters. I encourage the reader to keep an eye out for surprising uses of doubled pawns. I think he will discover that modern players are much less dogmatic than their predecessors about taking them on. I have continually emphasized that modern pawn play is pragmatic and rule-independent. But to close this chapter, let me point to an in sight that might serve as a useful modern gener ality. In discussing rules which apply to the middlegame but not endgame, Suba states: "The outside passed pawn is more of a weak ness in the middlegame, when the fight is con centrated on the centre and kingside." This is a bit shocking; we are so used to outside passed pawns as assets in the endgame that it doesn't occur to us that they might be weak otherwise. The only way to test such a hypothesis is to find supporting examples and counter-examples. I find Suba's comment intriguing, because I can think of several cases in which it is true, and none in which it is clearly contradicted. I men tioned one such supporting case earlier in this chapter: the white a2-pawn in the Benko Gam bit after 4 cxb5 a6 5 bxa6 i.xa6. That pawn is notoriously weak and often falls; it certainly has few serious prospects of advancing in the middlegame, although of course it might prove decisive in an ending. Then there's the white h pawn in the 'iii' g4 French Poisoned-Pawn Winawer (1 e4 e6 2 d4 d5 3 li:'lc3 i.b4 4 e5 c5 5 a3 i.xc3+ 6 bxc3 li:'le7 7 'iii' g4 'iii' c7 8 'iii' xg7 :Ig8 9 'ii' xh7 cxd4, etc.). Anyone familiar with these lines knows how often this pawn is surrounded and captured, and in any case, it is usually a tar get of attack by Black in the middlegame.
MODERN PAWN PLAY 139
Needless to say, in conjunction with the ad vance of the g-pawn, it can also prove to be a winning advantage in an ending. A third exam ple would be Black's a-pawn in the gambit line of the 8 .l:.b1 Griinfeld Exchange V ariation (1 d4 lLlf6 2 c4 g6 3 lLlc3 d5 4 cxd5 lLlxd5 5 e4 lLlxc3 6 bxc3 i.g7 7 lLlf3 c5 8 .l:.b 1 O-O 9 i.e2 cxd4 10 cxd4 �a5+ 11 i.d2 'ii' xa2). There are indeed circumstances in which it is useful to advance that pawn to a5 or a4; but in the ma jority of cases, White's pressure on the queen side files (as in the Benko) and the superior de velopment allowed by his central pawn-mass neutralize the passed a- and b-pawns in the middlegame. In fact, it is very common for both of these pawns to be captured in return for one of White's central pawns. Finally, we have already noted elsewhere in this book that in the Noteboom/Abrahams Variation of the Queen's Gambit (1 d4 d5 2 c4 c6 3 lLlf3 e6 4 lLlc3 dxc4 5 a4 i.b4 6 e3 b5 7 i.d2 a5 8 axb5 i.xc3 9 .i.xc3 cxb5 10 b3 i.b7 and then 1 1 bxc4 b4 12 .i.b2 or 11 d5!? lLlf6 12 bxc4 b4 13 .i.xf6), White's centre does rather well against two outside con nected passed pawns which are already fairly advanced! So Suba's hypothesis makes a certain amount of sense to me. It would be interesting to pore over modern practice and try to come up with other such neo-principles. My guess is that most of them would prove to be highly quali fied by conditions, and much more difficult to state. One thing seems clear, however: modern pawn play has come a long way since the time of Nimzowitsch! The alert reader will find many further examples of novel pawn treat ments in the rest of Part 2, even in sections nominally devoted to other subjects.
4 The Modern Bishop
It is time to reopen the subject of minor-piece play. In Part 1 (Chapter 6), we looked at con ventional ideas about minor pieces, following the traditional presentation of middlegame books. In the next few chapters, I want to look at the advances which have altered that conven tional view. First, I will examine each piece in isolation, exploring issues which can reason ably be treated in that fashion. A chapter will then follow on the interaction between, and comparative values of, bishops and knights. Finally, the subject of the exchange sacrifice (rook for bishop or rook for knight) is given its own chapter. As this breadth of material shows, I feel that the treatment of minor pieces constitutes an im portant part of what has changed since the ad vent of modem chess. Although one could write volumes about rooks and their qualities, one would be hard-pressed to make a case for nu merous advances that we have experienced in rook play. (I have attempted to address this sub ject in Part 1, but without any pretence that it is an extensive one.) Minor-piece play is another matter; for one thing, the issues involved are far more complex. I believe that if you asked chess teachers to name the most difficult positional problems players face, most of them would put the proper handling and assessment of minor pieces high on their list. Moreover, countless positions in practical chess depend upon who has the better minor pieces. As Steve Mayer says in the Preface to his book Bishop versus Knight: The Verdict: "The most common mate rial imbalance in chess is that of bishop versus knight." By which he means, of course, that in any given situation one minor piece is usually more valuable than the other. That difference in value is of the utmost importance for under standing the new ideas in modem chess. All That Fianchettoing In an article written in 1928 (quoted by Keene in ECOI), Spielmann talks about openings in his time. After reviewing a number of these, he mentions Nimzowitsch's idea of 1 lLlf3 fol lowed by b3 and �b2; against this, he says, a good defence is the counter-fianchetto by ...g6 and ...�g7. Then he bursts out: "This constant fianchettoing! In the hands of the defender, whose task is to equalize the game, it consti tutes a good weapon, but for the attacker it is of small value as a method of development." When I searched databases of Spielmann's games, I found that, true to his word, he only re sorted to a fianchetto as White in 2% of his games, whereas he played either ... b6 and ... .tb7 or ... g6 and ... .tg7 in almost 9% of them. I think that his irritated cry ("This constant fianchetto ing !") reflects a typical attitude of the time: that the fianchetto was an increasingly bothersome annoyance to the practitioners of true chess, i.e., those who occupied the centre properly, de veloped pieces in one move, and in general ad hered to the gentleman's rules for a real chess contest. Little did he know how the use of the fian chetto would expand. Kingside fianchettoing for White (by g3) was a rare bird in Spiel mann's day. But Botvinnik used the g3 fian chetto in 9% of all his games, and in our time, Karpov has used it in 13% of his games. As for fianchettoes of all types with Black, Lasker did so in only about 5% of his total games (and of ten outside of normal development, after move 10), whereas Alekhine did so in about 8.5% of his. But Nimzowitsch used fianchettoes on the black side with gusto - 18% of his games - and Kasparov has established an amazing 28% mark! (All these figures refer to the percentage of total games played with both colours; hence, Kasparov fianchettoes in over half of his games as Black!). The reality is still more extreme, as the above figures don't include fianchettoes by ...b5 and ... .tb7, which have become more common in modern chess (Kasparov's fian chetto percentage on the black side, for exam ple, rises to 31% of all his games if these are taken into account).
THE MODERN BISHOP 141
The double fianchetto, an accepted part of today's play, was held in particular scorn by some of the old school. About the moves 1 tLlf3 tLlf6 2 b3 d6 3 g3, which Nimzowitsch (White) played against him in New York 1927, Ale khine comments: "So, the purest hypermodern erei. In this game it would certainly have brought White no laurels if his opponent had not overestimated his position and imagined that such a set-up could be refuted by any means." What do we read in this miffed tone? Alekhine was a bit too smart to truly believe that b3 and g3 was refutable; he was simply irri tated that anyone could actually play this way and beat him! On move six, suggesting an im provement for Black (which is accompanied by some poor analysis), he goes on say: "In that case [after his suggested move - JW] ... the 'double-hole' opening would once again have been reduced ad absurdum." This was a refer ence to Teichmann, who had described Reti's (double-fianchetto) opening as 'the stupid dou ble-hole variation', reflecting the feelings of many traditionalists. What happened? Essentially, the hyper moderns were right about the fianchetto, which allowed a player to exert influence on the centre without being subjected to harassment by pieces and pawns. In addition, the defensive functions of a fianchettoed bishop had been underesti mated, in particular its role in defending the king. One way to think about the fianchetto and how it affects one's own bishop is to take into account the opponent's bishops. Consider the King's Indian Defence for a moment, after 1 d4 tLlf6 2 c4 g6 3 tLlc3 i..g7 (D). w Let's talk about White's queen's bishop. In some, less popular, lines, White tries to bring it out to f4 or g5 and then play e3, so that both of his bishops will be 'good' (unobstructed by the centre pawns). But if the bishop goes to g5, it can be attacked by ... h6, and after i.. h4, the idea ...g5, and after i..g3 gaining the bishop-pair by ... tLlhS, which has been shown to compensate for his weakened kingside (this is also true in the Benoni Defence). Or, if the bishop goes to f4, it will often lose a tempo to ... d6 and ... e5 (or in some cases ... tLlhS). So Black's structure plays a role in limiting the possibilities of White's dark-squared bishop. On the other hand, when White plays conventionally by 4 e4 d6 5 tLlf3 O-O 6 i.. e2, keeping that bishop's diagonal from c 1 to h6 free, the typical insertion of ... e5 for Black and d5 for White has an interesting ef fect. Now Black's g7-bishop is 'bad', but sud denly, White's light-squared bishop is equally bad, hemmed in by the c4-d5-e4 structure. Also, the optical assessment of a fianchettoed bishop as 'good' or 'bad' is often deceptive, as we shall see in the next section. The point is that simply focusing on the fate of the g7-bishop (which is hemmed in after ... e5) ignores the ac companying effect on the opponent's pieces. It should hardly be necessary to list the mul titudinous examples of the fianchetto in today's openings. This is one of the clearest and most obvious examples of a radical change in today's chess. Now we have entire opening complexes such as the English Opening dominated by fianchettoes by both sides, and the various In dian openings have such latent dynamism as to refute completely Spielmann's notion that the fianchetto was of no use to the attacker. Most Sicilian Defences depend upon the efficacy of a fianchettoed bishop, whether on g7 or b7. White uses g3 to counter virtually every Indian Defence, and even fianchettoes in the Queen's Gambit (Catalan). And so forth. Both conceptually and in practice, the fian chettoed bishop has changed the nature of mod ern chess. As for the idea that the fianchetto is somehow less 'dynamic', one need only note that bishops developed in classical fashion are far more subject to exchange, with consequent simplification, than are their fianchettoed part ners. The implications for a real fight with max imal complications should be obvious.
142 SECRETS OF MODERN CHESS STRATEGY
The New Morality of Bad Bishops The traditional view has it that a bishop which is of the same colour as one's pawns is a 'bad' bishop, in that the mobility of the bishop is re stricted by its own pawns, and the squares in front of those pawns are unprotected by the bishop. To begin with, we should make some qualifications. The first is that it is the centre pawns which for the most part determine whether a bishop is 'bad' or not. The d- and e pawns are of the most importance, followed by the c- and f-pawns, whereas the other pawns are largely irrelevant (until the endgame, when they can once again determine how bad a bishop is). Let me illustrate this with a simple example: This is from a King's Indian Defence. Black has six pawns on light squares and only two pawns on dark squares, and yet his light squared bishop on d7 is 'good' whereas his dark-squared bishop on g7 is 'bad'. Similarly, White has a 'bad' light-squared bishop, although only three of his eight pawns are on light squares. Another fairly obvious qualification is that if the bishop is 'outside' its same-colour pawns (which is to say, it is not trapped behind them); then that bishop is still 'bad', technically speak ing, but may be perfectly effective, especially in the middlegame. Here is a stark example of bad bishops of contrasting strengths (D): In the endgame, there are few situations in which a bad bishop is better than a good one. The exceptions tend to be cases in which the bishop, by defending its own pawns, is able to prevent progress by the opponent and thus achieve a draw. I will assume that the reader is familiar with the typical endgame examples of a good bishop defeating a bad bishop, or a knight doing the same thing, and will not pur sue this topic. Even one centre pawn on the wrong colour can make a bishop bad, or at least a problem piece. The Sicilian Defence gives us a well known example. Larsen's tongue-in-cheek sug gestion that White is positionally lost after 1 e4 c5 2 lt::l f3 d6 (or alternatively, 2 ... lt::l c6 or 2 ... e6)
3 d4 cxd4 has as its basis the fact that Black has
an extra centre pawn. White has another prob lem, however: his king's bishop. Consider the Najdorf Variation after 1 e4 c5 2 lt::l f3 d6 3 d4 cxd4 4 lt::l xd4 lt::l f6 5 lt::l c3 a6 (D). Where does the fl-bishop go? On g2 or d3, it is blocked by the e-pawn and lacks scope. On e2, it is passively placed, and if it travels further to f3 (with or without the move f4), Black can
THE MODERN BISHOP 143
either directly or indirectly stop White's e5, rendering the bishop 'bad'. All this might sug gest i.c4; but there, the bishop is subject to loss of tempi by ...b5 or ... d5, with ...tLlbd7-c5 an other consideration, when the e-pawn requires further protection. So far, so obvious. But I give this example to point out a third qualification which I believe has been neglected in the literature: a bad bishop is a particular liability for the player committed to attack. One could say that in our Najdorf example, when Black plays ...e5 or ...e6 and puts his bishop on e7, that it is every bit as bad as White's bishop on g2 or d3. This is true, but in the Sicilian (as in many modern defences), Black holds some long-term posi tional trumps: the aforementioned extra centre pawn and a ready-made minority attack aided by his open c-file. White cannot therefore sit still; it is incumbent upon him either to disturb the pawn structure or to embark upon direct at tack, or both. This requires maximal activity for his pieces, in order to create threats. It would be nice if his bishop were not hemmed in for such an effort. Black, on the other hand, is well-off maintaining the structural status quo, including his bad bishop, until some point in the middle game or endgame when he can make an advan tageous break in the centre or advance on the queenside. Anyone trying to devise schemes for the white side of the Open Sicilian will un derstand what I'm talking about and recognize the negative role White's bad light-squared bishop often plays. We might, then, posit a provisional modern 'principle', then, that a bad bishop is not so bad if one holds structural advantages in a stable position. Naturally, White would not play the Open Sicilian if he didn't have a reasonable chances of attacking and of favourably trans forming the pawn structure. But as a rule(?), the attacker's bad bishop tends to be the more per manent problem. Similar examples abound in modern chess, for example, in the case of Black's hedgehog formations versus a bishop on g2, or in the Bogo-Indian line 1 d4 lt:'lf6 2 c4 e6 3 lt:'lf3 i.b4+ 4 i.d2 "fke7 5 g3 lt:'lc6 6 i.g2 i.xd2+ 7 lt:'lbxd2 d6 8 e4 e5 9 d5 lt:'lb8 (D). In this line, White's bishop is bad and Black's good, of course; but if White can make effective breaks by c5 and/or f4, his attack will w break down Black's structure and free his own bishop. The longer Black can prevent such breaks and stabilize the situation, the more of a problem the g2-bishop becomes. The idea of the extra centre pawn is quite rel evant here. When Suba speaks of 'bad bishops protecting good pawns', he may have in mind the dynamic potential of such pawns. Three ex amples we have already mentioned with regard to backward pawns are the Open Sicilian struc tures with ... e6 & ...d6 versus e4, and ...e5 & ... d6 versus e4, as well as the French Defence structure with ... e6 & ... d5 versus d4 (see Chap ter 3). In each case, White has an open file against a backward pawn, but the weak pawn is an extra centre pawn, and the bad bishop pro tecting it prevents the first player from having anything but an optical advantage. In the mean time, the constant threat of ... d5 (in the Sicilian) or . . . e5 (in the French), along with the play against the opposing white e- or d-pawn (which, as a lone centre pawn, can be awkward to de fend), greatly ameliorates the 'badness' of Black's bishop in these cases. The King's Indian Defence is a fruitful source for instructive positional exemplars, and it is all the more so for the subject of the bad bishop. Modern chess is rife with paradox, and one of these is the idea of intentionally creating a bad bishop at the outset of the game, only then to spend the rest of the game trying to free it! In the KID, this happens at an early stage, the min ute Black plays ... e5, e.g., after 1 d4 lt:'lf6 2 c4 g6 3 lt:'lc3 i.g7 4 e4 d6 5 lt:'lf3 O-O 6 i.e2 e5, or any other line in which ... e5 is played early on. We have already discussed how Black's bad bishop tends to be counterbalanced by White's
144 SECRETS OF MODERN CHESS STRATEGY
own light-squared one, after d5 is played (and is difficult to avoid this indefinitely; for at some point, Black's ... exd4 can open up lines for both the bishop on g7 and a rook on e8, whereas White's light-squared bishop remains passive. This is, of course, a classic trade-off of space for activity; but in most KID lines, d5 is the best move at some point). A very interesting situation arises after Black plays ...e5, White plays d5, and Black tries to exchange his dark-squared bishop (of ten, by ...i.h6); this arises in the Czech Benoni and Modern Defence as well. Although it is un wise to generalize about so dynamic an open ing, it is remarkable how often trading the wonderful c 1-bishop for the awful g7-bishop favours White! Let's look at a few examples: Zsu. Polgar - Gheorghiu Baden-Baden 1985

i.a6 To digress a bit, another example of a dubi ous ...i.a6 arises in the French Winawer after 1 e4 e6 2 d4 d5 3 lt:)c3 i.b4 4 e5 lt:)e7 5 a3 i.xc3+ 6 bxc3 b6 7 'ii' g4 lt:)g6 8 h4 h5 9 'ii' f3 i.a6 10 i.xa6 lt:)xa6 1 1 i.g5, and as Unger points out, Black wishes that he had his bad bishop back again: 1 l ...

The 'bad' bishop was rather effec tive here! 6 lt:)g3 i.xc3+ 7 bxc3 d5 8 'ir'f3!? This is probably not best, but it emphasizes the danger of the 'bad' bishop exchange. I think the main line with 8 i.a3 i.xc4 9 i.xc4 dxc4 10 O-O 'ir'd7 1 1 e4 also favours White, who tends to exploits Black's weak light squares, of course. 8 ...

For one thing, the absence of the fianchettoed bishop weakens the squares around the knight's pawn. But also (and this is particularly true of many King's In dian lines), White's resulting space advantage is if anything easier to exploit in the absence of the bad bishop, because his pawn-breaks can proceed without the danger that central pawn exchanges will free that piece! This may seem paradoxical, but is a good example of general prophylactic play, as discussed in Chapter 9. In a sense, placing the fianchettoed bishop behind its own pawn-chain might be called a 'mysterious bishop move', analogous to Nim zowitsch's 'mysterious rook move'. For those unfamiliar with the latter, Nimzowitsch was wont to put a rook not on an open file, but on a closed one which would become open if his op ponent played his most natural freeing or at tacking pawn move. The rook might not seem to be doing anything, but it was discouraging
146 SECRETS OF MODERN CHESS STRATEGY
his opponent's main plan. Today, this is such a common technique that we hardly give it any thought. A bishop on g7 and a pawn on e5 for Black serve a similar purpose versus White's f4. Also, after a later . .. f5, White has to take into account the power of the g7-bishop before he opts for exf5. There has been a considerable change in the attitude towards bad bishops in modern chess. Certainly, a bad bishop is still to be avoided in most cases, particularly if simplification is pos sible and the endgame looms. But there is a wide variety of situations in which the intuitive desire to keep good bishops or exchange bad ones is misguided. One of Suba's games illus trates this. Groszpeter - Suba Kecskemet 1979

lt:Je3 c5 6 b3 lt:Jec6! Moving a piece which has already moved three times; this reflects a modern attitude we have referred to before. Since ... e5 is desirable, the only question is how best to achieve it, not how many pieces we have out. It is revealing that no one had played this before. 7 i.b2 e5 8 g3 i.d6 9 i.g2 O-O 10 lt:Je2 f5 11 lt:Jc4 i.c7 12 d3 i.e6 13 'ifd2 i.dS! (D) Here Suba comments: "Eliminating the ac tive white bishop allows Black virtually to 'play on his own'. A principle of dynamic strat egy is thus illustrated - the most important stra tegic piece should be protected from exchange. Needless to say, classical strategy recommends Black to avoid exchanges in such positions due to his space advantage, and especially to avoid exchanging his 'good bishop' as long as he still has his 'bad' one." Well, it's not hard to see how irrelevant the morality of the bishops is here. The game con tinued ... 14 i.xd5+ ..Rxd5 15 O-O-O lt:Jd4 16 lt:Je3 'ikd7 17 lt:Jc3 lt:Jbc6 18 �b1 b5 ... and Black had a straightforward attack on the queenside as well as a grip on the centre. The bad c7-bishop went first to a5, and later to h4 via d8, finding plenty of useful work! In Dvoretsky's book Positional Play, Vladi mir Kramnik wrote an interesting essay about the modern Stonewall Variation of the Dutch Defence, which opens with 1 d4 f5 2 c4 lDf6 3 lt:Jf3 e6 4 g3 d5 5 i.g2 c6 6 O-O i.d6 (D). w Right away, Kramnik makes an interesting comment: "The main idea of Black's strategy is to limit the range of the g2-bishop. In my opin ion, it is barely any stronger than the c8- bishop." What a remarkable statement! White's 'good' bishop (see the pawn on d4), he is say ing, is only slightly better than the one on c8, which is considered one of the worst bishops in any opening! Kramnik continues: "After castling, Black has a choice between two means of developing his queen's bishop. Sometimes it goes (via d7) to e8, freeing d7 for the queen's knight. Then it is possible to play ...i.h5 (with the option of ex changing it) or prepare ...c6-c5. Black more of ten plays ...b7-b6, ...i.c8-b7, and ...lt:Jbd7, developing his queenside in similar fashion to the Queen's Indian or the Catalan."
THE MODERN BISHOP 147
I think the most interesting aspect of this vol untary acceptance of a bad bishop is that the earlier it occurs, the better. Chess is a very fluid game, and the side trying to get to a stable posi tion versus the bad bishop will normally find it impossible to prevent all the possible liberating moves and changes of pawn structure, assuming that the bad bishop doesn't arise too late in the game. One example of this, in Kramnik's line: Ki. Georgiev - Knaak E.Germany-Bulgaria 1987

Sometimes it's OK to make a bishop not just 'bad', but thoroughly stupid-looking, so long as one's goals are achieved. Here is an example of the lengths to which pragmatism pervades modern chess (pointed out by Mayer):
B
Porreca - Bronstein Belgrade 1954 A more or less typical-looking Caro-Kann position. Black is leery of 1 1 ...e6 due to sacri fices on e6. Yet 1 1 ...O-O-O loses the f-pawn. So: l l. .. i.g8!! I've got to play ...e6 to get my pieces out, Black reasons, so ... I'll do anything to play it! The game continued ... 12 lLld3 e6 13 i.f4 i.d6 14 i.xd6 Rxd6 15 lLlf5 Rf8 16 'ii' f3 O-O-O 17 lLlg3 ..th7! ...and White had no advantage whatsoever (in fact, Black's is probably the easier position to play). It's not exactly clear which rules Bronstein was flaunting, but many a classical player would recoil from a move like 1 1 ...i.g8. That's enough for the moment on bad bish ops. It's worth emphasizing, in conclusion, that having a bad bishop can and often will be rea son enough to have a lost game. It is not that bad bishops are somehow ignored in modern chess, just that players are more aware of a con siderable number of situations in which their morality is a secondary or irrelevant issue. In particular, the distinction between the owner of a bad bishop who has long-term positional trumps and the possessor of a bad bishop who is under the necessity of attacking should be borne in mind. Furthermore, the earlier in the opening that one commits to a bad bishop, the easier it is to exploit one's other advantages, fa vourably exchange that bishop, or transform the pawn structure so that the bishop is no lon ger bad. I hope the above discussion explains why we see so many top players taking on bad bishops in contemporary chess. The Bishop-pair Reconsidered Issues of two bishops will also arise in the chapters on bishops versus knights and the ex change sacrifice. Here I would like to have some fun by examining what some other middlegame authors have said about the bishop-pair, and then cite some statistics. For some reason, this subject seems to evoke strong emotions, partic ularly on the part of those who think that bish ops are overrated. Flesch, in his Planning in Chess, begins his book with such a thesis, and he doesn't shy away from stating his case: "Throughout human history false dogmas have arisen that greatly influence the politics, the social views and the arts of the particular
148 SECRETS OF MODERN CHESS STRATEGY
age. Thus also with chess in its international de velopment. "A typical mistake of chess theory and prac tice in the present age is to overestimate the bishop, and even more so the two bishops, when correspondingly valued against the knight and the two knights ! Statistics ... have emphasized the superiority of the bishop-pair. But all this has come about from a mistaken approach to and a misunderstanding of the middle game. For there is no difference in the value of these pieces whatsoever." Right away, I (JW) have to interject that this last seems like more than a little bit of 'dogma' itself. It would be a pretty amazing coincidence if rules drawn up by a rather chaotic historical process resulted in literally no difference of value between two pieces which move in such completely different ways! The inventors of the game would have had to possess an insight into the game modern players, with the benefit of centuries of experience, don't yet have. But at any rate, what would be the reason that the side with the bishops is scoring better in international play (see also my research be low)? Flesch continues: "But, and this is the point, contemporary chess players use the bishop and especially the bishop-pair better and with more assurance than did their predecessors. "Human beings - owing to their physical build - are less well shielded against attacks from the side than from the front. This disad vantage is more accentuated in our 'forward looking' modern man as he spends a consider able amount of his time behind the wheel or in front of the file or television screen. Perhaps here can be found one of the reasons for overes timation of the bishop's value ... the truth is that chess players of a previous age knew better how to use one or two knights." This sounds like something out of a nine teenth-century phrenology essay ! Maybe a study of the games of chess-players who don't drive and don't watch TV would reveal some brilliant knight play! Of course, getting the grant money will be difficult. In all seriousness, this unfortunate beginning to Flesch's book belies its real worth as an ex cellent overview of modern positional concepts, with well-chosen examples. His overstatement with regard to bishops and knights, however, draws on a tradition which goes back to Chi gorin arguing against Lasker, as described in Romanovsky's Middlegame Planning book. Chigorin's point of view was that, Steinitz to the contrary notwithstanding, the two bishops did not constitute an advantage in and of them selves. Romanovsky devotes an entire chapter to this subject, agreeing vehemently with Chi gorin. But the method he uses to demonstrate this is an odd one indeed: he gives three games in which the two bishops absolutely dominate the board, one at the cost of a pawn and another at the cost of the exchange ! His point is that when the bishops dominate, they do so because of a 'favourable combination of a number of positional factors' . In the first example, he makes a big point of the fact that, in the end, only one of Black's two bishops really did the damage, so it really wasn't 'the two bishops' that were successful. If that argument seems a little strained, consider his next example: Kotov - Kashdan USA-USSR radio match 1945

... i.f8, while he could have tried to introduce the knight into the game by ...l2Jh7-f6." Maybe it's just my modern prejudice (too much TV?), but I wouldn't like to be Black in this position at all ! One feels that, as White, a Fischer, Karpov, or Kramnik, just to name a few players, would expect to win such a position against even the world's best. Of course, there is no way of definitively proving this, particu larly as polling the top players would just verify their own prejudices (and/or driving habits). 28 .l:1b1 cxd4 29 cxd4 .:.b7 30 i.g3 b5 31 l::t c1 aS 32 .:.c8+ 'Ot>h7 33 'it>e2 a4 34 i.xe6 fxe6 35 .l:tb8 "And so," Romanovsky concludes trium phantly, "Black's defeat is provoked not by White's two bishops, which, incidentally, are already gone from the board, but the terrible position of his own bishop on g7 ." I need hardly point out an alternative expla nation, known as trading one positional advan tage for another, which is surely the case here. The game concluded quickly: 35 ... .:.xb8 36 i.xb8 b4 37 'it>d3 i.h6 38 f4 g5 39 g4 hxg4 40 hxg4 gxf4 41 exf4 1-0 "Thus to the question of whether, in evaluat ing a position, the factor of the presence of the two bishops for one of the opponents should be taken into account as a particular aspect of the advantage, the right reply, in our view, will be no, it should not. This particular aspect of the advantage does not exist." Well, there is a good point hidden behind Roinanovsky's rather bizarre presentation, which is that, as any good player will tell you, the bishop-pair can be either strong or weak, depending upon the position. But in general, this old debate is no longer such a heated one. In a majority of cases, modern players prefer the two bishops for the very good reason that they tend to win games. Those rare, completely locked positions, or the more frequent ones in which the side with the knights have counter vailing advantages, are a different matter. But the simple fact is that the bishops are better in more positions than not, as I will show next. Let's examine some database statistics on 2i. vs 2lLI, and then 2i. vs i.+lLI. The first thing to test is pure endings, i.e., those with no other pieces. With even pawns, the two bishops win against two knights about 40% of the time for either Black or White, whereas the knights win only 15% of the time. This yields a hefty 63%/37% winning ratio in both cases. Now the normal winning percentage for White/Black is 54%/46% ratio; so the bishop-pair creates a 9% improvement for White over the usual percent ages, and an amazing 17% improvement for Black! When we take all cases of two bishops versus two knights, with even material, but in cluding queens and rooks, the winning ratio for the bishops is 62%/38% with White and 57%/43% with Black. (All these statistics as sume that the conditions of 2i. vs 2lLI and level material last at least 6 half-moves). It is worth pointing out that part of this last winning per centage for the bishop-pair is probably due to the fact that the possessor of the knight-pair will do almost anything to avoid the pure end ing (without other pieces), and may take risky steps to avoid it. Finally, I should mention Mayer's observation that Chigorin himself, the two-knights defender, scored only 29%n 1 % in games in which he himself had the knight-pair versus two bishops. The 2i. vs i.+lLI case is similarly successful for the bishops. With no other pieces, White's winning ratio is 64%/36%; interestingly, this includes wins for Black (with the bishop and knight) in only 8% of the games ! When Black has the two bishops versus White's bishop and knight (again with no other pieces), his percent age is a hefty 62%/38%. When queens and rooks are included (but with even material), White's winning ratio with the bishop-pair goes to 6 1 %/39%, still well above the 54%/46% norm; and Black's (also with the bishops) is 54%/46%, 8% above average.
150 SECRETS OF MODERN CHESS STRATEGY
Finally, what influence does a material im balance have? In the 2i. vs 2li:J case, let's give the bishops an extra pawn. Then White (with 2i.+l!.) achieves a staggering winning percent age of 88%/12% in the ending without other pieces, and 78%/22% when other pieces are in cluded. The parallel figures with White having two knights plus a pawn versus Black's two bishops are much lower, at 66%/34% and 60%/40% respectively. The 2i. vs i.+li:J re sults are also powerfully in the bishops' favour: when White has the two bishops and extra pawn, for example, his winning percentage is 87%/13% without other pieces, and 78%/22% with them. But when White has the bishop, knight and extra pawn against Black's two bishops, his corresponding winning percent ages are only 63%/37% and 6 1 %/39%, respec tively. It's obvious that the two bishops help in defence as well as in creating winning chances. So in the ending or not, the bishops are in deed a potent force, justifying the preferences of nearly every modem player. It is particularly interesting to see the almost excessive winning percentages for Black, which presumably arise because the influence of the first move has faded by the time that Black acquires the bish ops, and possibly also because modem open ings tend to yield Black the bishop-pair under favourable circumstances more often than they do White. The important thing is that the bishop-pair is statistically superior under all of the above material distributions. Protests from the likes of Flesch and Romanovsky notwith standing, I believe that we can consider this old debate as resolved. While it bears repeating that the strength of the bishops or knights is depend ent upon the particular features of the position, it is also true that in a majority of actually aris ing positions, the two bishops will beat either the knight-pair or a bishop and knight. In the next chapter, we take up the case of the knight, and how its role has changed in modem times.
5 The Contem porary Kn i g ht
The knight has traditionally been the most diffi cult piece to handle, for the professional as well as the amateur. Its movement is the least 'natu ral' of the pieces, and threats from it are more easily overlooked than from other pieces (Lar sen once commented that it was good to have the knight-pair in blitz games !). Not surpris ingly, the use of knights has changed along with the rest of the game. In this chapter, I will ex amine how the knight as an individual piece has seen its role change in modern times. They Live on the Edge Instructional texts generally include some hor rific example of a knight which is stuck on the edge of the board, cut off from the rest of the play, haplessly watching as its owner is con demned to play effectively a piece down. They duly cite Tarrasch's comment about knights which, loosely translated, goes "knights on the rim are grim"; and consider the lesson well taught. The innocent student files away this gem of wisdom and keeps his knights in the centre thenceforth. But in modern chess, the good players have a thoroughly pragmatic attitude towards this old saw, and don't hesitate to use knights on the edge of the board when it serves their purpose. Right off, I should note that this lawless attitude towards the horses applies primarily to the middlegame and opening. Tisdall's comment about rules in chess tending to retain more va lidity in the ending applies here as well; cer tainly a well-centralized knight tends to show its superiority when there are few other pieces on the board. During the rest of the struggle, however, the player who ignores the side of the board for his knights, merely on principle, only cripples his ability to deal with positions optimally. This is best shown by example, so we turn to a num ber of well-established modern openings and early middlegames in which a knight serves a positive function out on the rim. It might be appropriate to begin with the example almost always given to show how bad a rim knight can be: the Panno/Yugoslav Variation of the g3 King's Indian Defence. This begins with:
1 d4 lLlf6 2 c4 g6 3 tLlc3 i.g7 4 g3 O-O 5 i.g2
d6 6 tLlf3 tLlc6! ? Since we are on the subject o f knights and modern chess, I should mention that this type of development was definitely frowned upon until the 1950s or thereabouts, although it is quite conventional now. In main line King's Indians in the 1920s, Yates had tried ...tLlc6 and after d5, ...tLlb8, to regroup via ...tLlbd7 and ...lUeS, but this proved too slow; so Black used ideas with ... e5, ... c5, and/or . . .tLlbd7 for some 30 years thereafter. No one dared to challenge Tarrasch's dictum with the impudent move . . . ttJa5 ; today, it appears in a number of KID lines.

More effrontery ! Black prepares .. J1b8 and ...b5, to chip away at the classic white centre. Again, we accept such notions without blinking an eye today, but in Lasker's day, only patzers would neglect both their development and oc cupation of the centre in such a manner. 8 d5 A recent example of the sustained influence of a knight on aS was Karpov-Shirov, Amber rapid, Monte Carlo 1998: 8 .:tel :b8 9 :bl :e8 10 d5 ttJa5 11 tLld2 c5 12 a3 ltJg4 1 3 'ii' c2 lUeS 14 b3 b5 15 h3 bxc4 16 bxc4 l:hbl 17 lLlcxb 1 'iVb6 18 tLlc3 i.f5 ! 19 e4 iLd7 20 tLld 1 :b8 (threatening to fully justify the knight's placement by ...tLlb3) 21 f4 (this appears posi tionally decisive, but the inherent dynamism in Black's position allows him to strike back) 2 1 . . .i.a4 ! ! 22 'ti'xa4 tLld3 23 tLlf3 lUxe I 24 tLlxel 'ti'bl 25 'ti'xa5 'ii' xc1 26 i.f3 i.d4+ 27 'it>h2 l1b3 28 h4 .:txa3 29 'ti'd8+ ri;g7 30 e5 'ti'd2+ 3 1 tLlg2 ltxf3 32 'ii' xe7 dxe5 33 h5 'ti'xd1 0- 1 . 8 ... ttJa5 There it stands, grimly attacking c4 ! The fight for that point will determine how effective
152 SECRETS OF MODERN CHESS STRATEGY
Black's strategy can be. At any rate, retreat by 8 . .lDb8 would be inconsistent with ... a6, and Black' s pieces would only get in each other' s way on the first rank. 9 tbd2 c5 10 'ii' c2 ltb8 11 b3 b5 12 i.b2 bxc4 13 bxc4 i.h6 (D) w This position has been a main line for almost 40 years, in spite of White's continued efforts to refute it. Black's last move is designed to provoke weaknesses in White's camp by means of the threat ...i.xd2 (which would incidentally 'free' the aS-knight to capture on c4). To this day, both sides are willing to go into this posi tion and, as far as I can make out from books and recent practice (1998), Black has full equality. That is particularly ironic, since middlegame texts so often use this variation to demonstrate the weakness of a knight on the rim. The idea of condemning a piece to a 'bad' square (in this case, the knight to a5) at an early stage, in order to spend much of the middle game trying to liberate it, should remind the reader of the 'bad' bishops in the last chapter, e.g., the one on g7 blocked by a pawn on e5. As in that case, when the 'bad' piece returns to ac tion, it often does so with a vengeance, gaining an advantage for the side we had been pitying. Let's look at a couple of recent examples of this middlegame: 14 f4 Since 14 e3 is met by 14 ...i.f5 !, White tries to retain the option of e4.

16 ... ltxb2! Here is one reason that I wanted to use this example. The modern exchange sacrifice for positional pressure (and/or attack) is the subject of an entire chapter (Chapter 8 below), and it can't hurt to see another example here. As with many such sacrifices, Black's compensation comes from a powerful unopposed bishop (here the dark-squared one) and a certain looseness in the enemy camp (squares like e3, d4, and c4 are lightly guarded, and the pawn on d5 after ...i.xd5 can also be vulnerable). In the classic Botvinnik, Reshevsky, and Portisch victories as White in this line (often accompanied by lectures about how Black mis placed his knight on a5), the second player didn't avail himself of this sacrificial opportu nity, or of other similar ones (e.g., ...ltb4 and after a3, ...l:r.xc4, with a pawn and pressure for the exchange). Modern chess is not only prag matic, it is dynamic and opportunistic ! 17 'ii' xb2 i.g7 18 'i¥c1 i.xd5 19 i.xd5 tbxd5 20 cxd5 (D) This position has been debated for years, with both sides achieving nice victories, but the overall assessment remains unclear. The fol lowing example features an idea for Black which has proved effective recently:

Black's idea was 23 ...tLlc4 !. Then after 24 tbxc4 (24 'ti'b3 'ii' xd2 25 'ti'xc4 l:!.e8 is no better) 24 ...\i'e4+ 25 1i'f3 'ii' xc4, Black has a pawn for the exchange. White's weak pawns on d5 and a2, along with his somewhat exposed king, make for a dynamically balanced game which will very likely be drawn. The point is not whether Black has equality in this opening; theory tends to revise its judge ments continually about such things. But at least it should be obvious from these examples that the knight on a5 has both advantages and disadvantages, and that a host of factors, both static and dynamic, will decide who comes out on top, as opposed to a narrow and simplistic rule. In many variations of the Modern Benoni Defence, the queen's knight goes to the flank square a6. Since it then often goes to c7, one might wonder how Black can spend two tempi to relocate a piece which looks perfectly natu ral on d7. Let's compare this placement with the more conventional one and see why: w Here's an example of White's g3 set-up ver sus ...tLlbd7. The d7-knight restrains the white e-pawn from advancing by e4-e5, but lends no support to the ... b5 idea. Here the knight has gone from a6 to c7 (in some cases, an a6-knight may go to b4, or to c5, after ...c4). White's e4-e5 plan is no longer di rectly restrained, but prophylactically, i.e., such an advance will expose the white d-pawn to at tack after . . .dxe5. In the meantime, the c7- knight directly supports ... b5. If White rushes a knight to c4, Black can bring his other knight to the rim as well by 12 tLld2 lLlh5 ! 13 i.e3 l:xe3 ! 14 fxe3 i.h6, and Black has enough compensa tion, according to Psakhis.

to play here due to White's horrible g2-bishop and his shattered, backward e-pawns. In the main line lDf3 Benoni, there are simi lar trade-offs: Once again, Black stops e5 directly, but his queen's bishop still lacks a role. To avoid this, Black often plays ...i.g4 and ...i.xf3 before ...lDbd7. That line has a good theoretical stand ing, although Black gives up his bishop-pair. A similar concession occurs in the ...lDa6 main line. After ...lDa6-c7, this position can arise: Again, the c7 -knight restrains e5 by attacking d5, and also supports ... b5. As in the ...lDbd7 lines, Black will normally concede the bishop pair to get his queenside moving, by ...i.xc4, followed by ...a6 and ... b5. Here ...lDd7 and ....l:r.e8 are often also played, to restrain White's e-pawn further. Needless to say, although plenty of players prefer ...lDbd7 in these posi tions, no one talks about the knight on the rim as being a violation of fundamental principle. A knight also goes to a6 (instead of d7 or c6) in so many modern lines of the King's Indian Defence that no one blinks an eye any more. Here are a few obvious examples (mostly in es tablished main lines): a) Four Pawns: 1 d4 lDf6 2 c4 g6 3 lDc3 i.g7 4 e4 d6 5 f4 O-O 6 lDf3 lDa6; b) Averbakh: 1 d4 lDf6 2 c4 g6 3 lDc3 i.g7 4 e4 d6 5 i.e2 O-O 6 i.g5 lDa6; c) Classical: 1 d4 lDf6 2 c4 g6 3 lDc3 i.g7 4 e4 d6 5 lDf3 O-O 6 i.e2 e5 7 O-O lDa6 (very pop ular at the moment); d) Exchange Variation: 1 d4 lDf6 2 c4 g6 3 lDc3 i.g7 4 e4 d6 5 lDf3 O-O 6 i.e2 e5 7 dxe5 dxe5 8 'ii' xd8 .l:r.xd8 9 i.g5 c6 1 0 lDxe5 l:te8 1 1 O-O-O lDa6; e) Classical Fianchetto: 1 d4 lDf6 2 c4 g6 3 lDc3 i.g7 4 lDf3 d6 5 g3 O-O 6 i.g2 c6 7 O-O lDa6 8 e4 e5. The interesting thing is that, despite the use of all of the above white systems for many years, only recently (in the last 10 years) have the lines with ...lDa6 attracted any serious atten tion. Surely this has to do with the old dogmas about knights on the rim. The reader may ask: OK, but why put the knight off on the side, where it doesn't control the key e5- and d4- squares? There are several reasons. For one thing, such a knight doesn't interfere with the development of the queen' s bishop, no small is sue. Also, c7 is defended, which can be impor tant in lines where White chooses dxe5 (since after ...dxe5 and the exchange of queens, lDb5 or lDd5 will attack that square). Furthermore a knight on a6 can swing powerfully into action via c5 (as after ...lDbd7, but not after ...lDc6), or it can come back to c7 to support a possible ... b5 break. Naturally, putting the knight on a6 is not a complete solution to Black's problems in the King's Indian; but those conversant with KID theory will recognize that the above lines are quite as good as those with more classi cally-developed knights. Sticking with knights on a6 for a moment, the Austrian Attack of the Pirc Defence goes 1 e4 d6 2 d4 lDf6 3 lDc3 g6 4 f4 i.g7 5 l2Jf3 O-O 6 i.d3, and now 6 ...lDc6 was used for years. In modern play, however, 6 ...lDa6 7 O-O c5 has become perfectly respectable. After 8 d5 (D) the following line reveals two advantages of ...lDa6:

A last ...lDa6 example (although there are more in several other openings) comes up in the very technical Double Fianchetto line of the Symmetrical English. After 1 c4 c5 2 lDf3 lDf6
3 g3 b6 4 .i.g2 .i.b7 5 O-O g6 6 b3 .i.g7 7 .i.b2
O-O 8 lDc3, 8 ...lDa6! is a lot easier than, for ex ample, 8 ...lDc6 9 d4 lDxd4 10 lDxd4 i.xg2 1 1 <lrxg2 cxd4 1 2 't!Vxd4 or 8 ...d5 9 lDxd5 lDxd5 10 .i.xg7 <Ji;xg7 11 cxd5 't!Vxd5 12 d4. After 8 ...lDa6, dxc5 will always be answered by ...lDxc5, and the b7-bishop continues to oppose White's g2- bishop directly. White has made no serious progress here, e.g., 9 d4 d5 10 lDe5 ( 10 dxc5 lDxc5 1 1 lDxd5 lDxd5 12 .i.xg7 <lrxg7 13 cxd5 'ti'xd5 is equal) 10. ..e6 1 1 dxc5 lDxc5 12 cxd5 exd5 13 lDf3 'ti'd7 ! 14 .l:.c 1 .l:.fe8 15 l::t c2 .l:.ad8 with equality, Ftacnik-Speelman, Thessaloniki Olympiad 1984. Such boring but effective lines elevated the Double Fianchetto Defence to a main line, used by Kasparov in his 1984/5 match with Karpov. White can also place his queen's knight on a3 or h3, of course. In various lines of the Alapin Sicilian (1 e4 c5 2 c3), this is an impor tant idea, e.g., 1 e4 c5 2 c3 d5 3 exd5 't!Vxd5 4 d4 lDf6 5 lDf3 .i.g4 6 dxc5 !? 't!Vxc5 7 h3 .i.h5 8 lDa3, or 1 e4 c5 2 c3 lDf6 3 e5 lDd5 4 d4 lDc6 5 lDf3 cxd4 6 .i.c4 lDb6 7 .i.b3 d5 8 exd6 't!Vxd6 9 lDa3 !?. But in general, this is not a major theme for White in 1 e4 openings, if only because the first player tends to occupy the centre directly in so many lines. Development with lDh3 oc curs in some English Opening lines (e.g., 1 c4 e5 2 lDc3 lDc6 3 g3 g6 4 .i.g2 .i.g7 5 d3 d6 6 lDh3 ! ?), and it has gained widespread accep tance against the Dutch Defence. This latter case provides an interesting contrast of philoso phies. In a variation such as 1 d4 f5 2 lDf3 lDf6
3 g3 g6 4 .i.g2 .i.g7 5 O-O O-O 6 c4 d6 7 lDc3,
White uses the f3-knight for direct suppression of ... e5 and control of d4, whereas the set-up 1 d4 f5 2 g3 lDf6 3 .i.g2 g6 4 c4 i.g7 5 lDh3 tries to leave the g2-bishop's diagonal unobstructed, and fights against ... e5 by positional means, e.g., 5 ...O-O 6 O-O d6 7 d5, when ... e5 allows dxe6, and the h3-knight comes efficiently into play via f4. Such a choice is more a matter of taste than of objective superiority. Another in teresting recent example arises in the Budapest Defence after 1 d4 lDf6 2 c4 e5 3 dxe5 lDg4 4 e3 lDxe5 5 lDh3 !? (D).
B
For some reason ('knights on the rim are grim' ?), White neglected this extremely logical move until recently. It aims the knight at the critical d5-square (after lDf4), rather than ex changing it after lDf3, which is hardly inspir ing. Sometimes knights on the rim support spe cific positional goals, so that their placement is relatively uncontroversial. In the Nimzo-Indian after ....i.xc3, and White recapturing by bxc3, Black's b8-knight goes to a5 almost as a matter of course, e.g., 1 d4 lDf6 2 c4 e6 3 lDc3 .i.b4 4 e3 c5 5 a3 .i.xc3+ 6 bxc3 lDc6 7 i.d3 O-O 8 lDe2 b6 9 e4 lDe8 10 .i.e3 i.a6 1 1 lDg3 lDa5 !

But we also see some very imaginative uses of knights on the rim, as in this idea: 1 d4 d5 2 c4 lDc6 3 lDc3 dxc4 4 tbf3 lDf6 5 .i.g5 a6!? 6 d5 tba7 ! (D). w This is a purely pragmatic move: Black threatens to defend his pawn by ...b5, but also wants to undermine White's support for his centre by ...lbb5, exchanging the important c3- knight. For example, 7 e4 lDb5 8 'i'c2 tbxc3 9 bxc3 b5 10 a4 .i.b7 1 1 tbd4, Pieterse-Boersma, Amsterdam 1986, and now 1 1 ...

The idea of ...lDa7 was neglected in this variation until just recently, but is more logical than previously-played moves. For my last examples within the realm of opening theory, I have to mention two amusing cases of very early knight moves which are re ceiving serious attention: the Sicilian Defence with 1 e4 c5 2 lDf3 tbc6 3 .i.b5 tba5 ! ? (prepar ing ...a6 and ...b5), and the Griinfeld Defence with 1 d4 tbf6 2 c4 g6 3 tbc3 d5 4 cxd5 tbxd5 5 tba4 !? (preventing ...c5 and threatening 6 e4). At the time of writing, there are strong grand masters playing both lines. Note that they are moving their only developed piece twice as well as violating Tarrasch's dictum! To conclude this section, Kosikov offers this nice middlegame example of a pragmatic knight move to the rim (from Training for the Tourna ment Player, p. 1 30):

Agzamov - Kosikov Leningrad 1972 Kosikov relates his thought-process: "Imagine what a powerful battery will be set up when the bishop comes to c6. Of course, it is desirable to maintain the queen on a central square, and this means that it is necessary to take steps to combat tbc3. You suggest exchang ing the dark-squared bishop for the knight on c3? You know, this idea is not particularly good, because the white bishop will come out to a3." So instead, Kosikov played simply. ..

Kosikov talks at length about this decision, but the remark that is most relevant to us con cerns the alternative 15 ...c5 : "But what is the point? You wish to get rid of the doubled pawn. But in what respect is my pawn on c7 inferior to the pawn on c3? I don't see it." Note the thor oughly pragmatic attitude towards doubled pawns: if they aren't bad, who cares? As dis cussed elsewhere in this book, if you make a blanket rule about doubled pawns being weak, you will miss out on their proper treatment.

open the long diagonal (with the unopposed bishop), leading to a decisive advantage for Black. The mini-leap to the rim by . . .tba4, to maintain the light squares regardless of the 'principles of development', was crucial for Black's whole plan. We could go on forever, but the point should be obvious by now. Modern players have no in hibitions about placing knights on the edge of the board, for the simple reason that they serve active functions there, and can combine with other pieces and ideas in an optimal manner. The old days of dogmatic knight centralization are forever gone. Optical Illusions There have been some interesting develop ments in the assessment and use of knight out posts. Increasingly, players allow attractive knights to nestle in their position, because those knights achieve little and/or are only established by allowing concessions elsewhere. We will discuss similar issues in later chapters, but here I would like to look at examples of what Mayer calls 'the overrated knight', and in particular, cases of what Dvoretsky calls 'the superfluous piece' (in this case, the superfluous knight). The English Opening and Sicilian Defence provide some well-known examples of out posts which appear stronger than they are. Here is an example from the English Opening:
1 c4 c5 2 tbf3 tbc6 3 tbc3 g6 4 g3 i.g7 5
iLg2 e5 6 O-O tbge7 7 d3 O-O 8 a3 d6 (D) Black's set-up (which is often used by White as well) concedes the d5-square right away (on move 5), without obvious compensation. But it turns out that a white knight on that square doesn't do that much by itself. In fact, from where it is on c3, White's knight ties down ...b5 by Black and has the option of swinging to e4 or d5; so it may happen that the knight is worse-placed on d5 in some lines. 9 .l:i.b1 aS 10 iLd2 In the early days, White often rushed his other knight to e3 via e1 and c2, concentrating completely on the d5 weakness: 10 tbe1 i.e6 (now that tbg5 is not an answer) 1 1 tbd5 .l:i.b8 12 tbc2 b5 13 tbce3 'ii' d7. OK, so White has got his knight to d5 and supported it, both with the other knight and with his g2-bishop. But where is his play? It is Black who has all the natural breaks: ... b5 (which he has already achieved) and ...f5. Barcza-Uhlmann, Sarajevo 1969 illustrates how the second player's activity is more impor tant than the lone outpost: 14 cxb5 .l:i.xb5 15 a4 .l:i.bb8 16 tbxe7+ tbxe7 17 tbc4 tbc6 18 iLd2 e4 ! 19 tbxa5 tbxa5 20 iLxa5, and among other moves, Uhlmann suggests 20 ...iLb3 ! 21 'li'd2 iLa2 22 .l:i.bc 1 .l:i.xb2 with a clear advantage for Black.

The main line of the Sveshnikov Sicilian provides an example of a rather powerful white knight on d5 vis-a-vis a backward pawn on an open file. Again, Black often just 'works around' the knight and obtains activity for his two bishops and rooks. For example, in the fol lowing game, I don't think that White was worse in the early middlegame, but there is something impressive about one of the world's top players getting run off the board while he calmly rear ranges his two 'ideal' knights around d5: Topalov - Krasenkov Polanica Zdroj 1995

Admittedly, White also has a powerful knight on c5, and he has a break in the centre with 2 1 e4. But up to the end of this game, none of Black's pieces are formally 'bad', and the c4-knight sits sublimely unperturbed. Unfortunately, it also never exerts any influence upon the game:

short order. To be fair, knights on the sixth, if well-secured, can be very powerful. But play ers and annotators today are aware that this is just a probabilistic advantage, not a hard-and fast rule. Any number of players in their notes have made the point that sometimes, such ad vanced knights merely spectate while the ac tion takes place elsewhere. It has also been remarked upon that the farther the advanced knight is from the centre (assuming that it isn't parked right in front of the enemy king), the less effective that knight is likely to be. Time and again in modern chess, we see a white knight that has laboriously ensconced itself at b6 only to have Black overrun the white king on the other side of the board, in part due to the forlorn absence of the now-distant knight for defence. So that the reader has something to re late to, I would point to the many main-line King's Indians with c4-c5, ...a6, and then an ex change on d6 followed by .!Dc4-b6 or .!Da4-b6, as in this position:

Zaltsman - Evans USA Ch, Greenville 1980 25 ... .l:.xc3 26 i.xc3 'ii' e8! The knight on b6 is far from the kingside ac tion, and Black's attack is already close to deci sive there. 27 .!Dc4?

Similarly forlorn knights can arise from the Benko Gambit after 1 d4 lDf6 2 c4 c5 3 d5 b5 4 cxb5 a6 5 b6. In some lines in which Black plays .. .'it'xb6, White rushes in with a4-a5 and .!Dc4-b6 or .!Da4-b6, but then gets stuck. And naturally, the same ideas can apply when Black occupies b3: in the Advance Variation of the French Defence, for example, when White plays
1 e4 e6 2 d4 d5 3 e5 c5 4 c3 lDc6 5 lDf3 'ii'
b6 6 a3. Then, after Black plays 6 ...c4 and at some point ....!Da5-b3, it can happen that the white pieces are able to avoid exchanges, shifting to the kingside and leaving the knight stranded on b3. Subsequently, f4-f5 can follow with effect. My own pet peeve is with white knights on c6. Middlegame books tend to show examples of a capture of c6 with decisive effect (there are a couple of nice Botvinnik games, for example), and indeed, a c6 outpost can still win a lot of games. I will even admit that, in a clear majority of cases, it is better to have a knight supported on c6 than not. However, in many openings (I have King's Indians and English Openings in mind), the time and effort involved in winning c6 is too high a cost, and the knight just sits there looking around from its proud post while the real action takes place on the kingside, or perhaps somewhere on White's second rank.

I'm not even sure if this knight-on-the-sixth phenomenon is something which has changed with modern play, but the reader should know that a well-secured knight on d6 or e6 is far more likely to be dominant (or even advanta geous) than one on c6, which in turn has a much better chance of being effective than one on b6. Naturally, I am assuming a position in which the kings have castled short, and I speak only of probabilities, not of a reliable rule upon which one can base one's play. The real point is that a clever player can lure a knight to an optically attractive post, and then exploit its absence from another part of the board, and that this happens relatively often in modern play. Are You Feeling Superfluous? One of the most intriguing modern ideas that has actually been codified is the brainchild of the Russian super-trainer IM Mark Dvoretsky. He discusses positions in which one side con quers a key square (an outpost, for instance) and is able to occupy it with a number or pieces. Very often, he points out, a defender will more or less blindly exchange at least one pair of pieces on that square, even though he cannot contest it enough times to rid himself of all the pieces which may eventually .settle there. But the defender has an alternative strategy which is often superior. To quote Dvoretsky (from Training for the Tournament Player): "If the square cannot be won back by means of exchanges, then one may ... forget about ex changes altogether (after all, only one of the op ponent's pieces will be able to occupy the 'important high ground' , and the others will turn out to be, so to speak, superfluous)." He calls the multiple claimants to a single outpost 'superfluous pieces' . I think that this is a concept with broad application in modern chess. Suba gives a sort of skeletal example which throws the issues involved into sharp re lief: Suba comments: "White to move should play 1 lt:Jxc7 'i/Bxc7 2 lt:Jd5 with a clear advantage of a dominant knight against a bad bishop and au tomatic play on the queenside by b4, bxc5, etc. Black to move should avoid the exchange and make the knight on c3 superfluous, for example l ...lt:Je6! , keeping the game alive with good counterchances on the kingside." It's surprising how often this theme arises, especially with knights (although there are good examples with rooks, they occur less fre quently; and of course, there are also combina tions of pieces which can occupy a square, such as knight and bishop). Dvoretsky quotes the following English Opening example, the basic idea of which occurs in any number of 1 c4 e5 variations:
THE CONTEMPORARY KNIGHT 161
w 10 .l:.b1 Ubilava - Dvoretsky Batumi 1969 10 ltJec3 ltJe8 ! intends either ... .ll h3 or ...ltJd8 followed by ...c6. This last theme arises in many English Opening positions, and equalizes with consistency, because White's two knights have trouble finding two squares as good as c3!
10. ..
.ll h3 U ltJec3 .llxg2 12 �xg2 ltJh5! Dvoretsky comments: "And here it turned out that there are two white knights competing for just one square (d5), and this is one too many. After 1 3 b4 f5 14 b5 lbd8, my opponent had to deal with both 15 ...c6 and 15. ..f4." The game continued ... 15 ltJe2 c6 16 bxc6 bxc6 17 'ii' a4 �h8 18 f3 ltJe6 19 ltJdc3 .l:.f7 ...with a 'marked advantage' for Black, ac cording to Dvoretsky. An elegant middlegame example of this same idea, again drawn from Dvoretsky, is the following position (D): Here Yusupov (in Training for the Tourna ment Player) comments: "I recently discussed this game with Mark Dvoretsky, and he drew my attention to the move 1 3 ltJb 1 ! . A hundred years ago, of course, they didn't play such moves. This sort of positional manoeuvre ... first appeared at a later date ... By avoiding an exchange, White intends to drive the knight away from e4 with 14 f3 and then play ltJc3, preparing e3-e4 ... Similar situations some times occur in the English Opening or in the Dutch Defence, in the Stonewall System." As Yusupov also points out, the black knight on f6 w Zukertort - Blackburne London 1883 is 'superfluous', and in general the knights are stepping all over each other after the simple 13 ltJb l ! . The reader will have n o difficulty finding further games in which the superfluous knight plays a role (for those interested in annotated games, Mayer has some rather more complex examples in Chapter 7 of Bishop versus Knight). Dvoretsky's concept has been noticed and com mented upon in various players' annotations, and is rapidly becoming part of the conscious conceptual arsenal of modern chess. In his Im prove Your Chess Now! (a book with many so phisticated insights and a too-modest title), Tisdall makes a similar observation, which might even be considered a sort of generaliza tion of Dvoretsky's idea: "The knight-pair are never happy protecting each other. Then, they step on each other's hooves, and reduce their own range. When protecting each other they of ten become paralysed in this configuration. They are best when employed side by side, when they can influence a virtual barrier of squares." In conclusion, the treatment of knights in modern chess is not as stereotyped as textbooks would wish. Knights use the edge of the board regularly and with success. Furthermore, just on the basis of familiar openings, allowing one's opponent a seemingly dominant knight outpost for the sake of play 'around' that out post is considerably on the increase. Finally,
162 SECRETS OF MODERN CHESS STRATEGY
knights can be superfluous, in that two of them may be competing for the only available out post, so that one will end up being relatively less effective. We will examine more of the knight' s properties in the next chapter, in rela tion to its counterpart, the bishop.
6 Bishops versus Kn ig hts 1 :
One-on-One In Chapter 4, we examined some issues relating to the bishop-pair; in particular, I presented an array of statistics demonstrating the superiority (in a probabilistic sense) of both two bishops versus two knights and two bishops versus bishop and knight, with or without material im balance. In this and the next chapter, I want to continue our examination of minor-piece issues by looking at the modern treatment of bishops and knights, from the case of bishop versus knight to a more intricate examination of two bishops versus two knights. First, we will look at modern openings and middle games in which one side trades a bishop for knight, and the is sues that arise therefrom. The Minor Pieces Face Off The easiest way to assess a position between evenly-matched, strong players is to look at the relative value of their minor pieces. This is hardly a foolproof test, of course, but the im portance of minor-piece play is constantly re flected in the annotations of grandmasters, in the discussions of positions in middlegame books, and in the explanations (when they ex ist) given by opening books about why a certain variation is to be preferred. One could even say that the biggest difference between two players' positional strength tends to reside in their han dling of the minor pieces, especially in those positions in which bishops and knights face off. In this, as much as in any area, modern chess players have discovered new and inventive ways to extract the maximum advantage from the imbalances created. There isn't a great deal of theory associated with the simple case of one bishop versus a knight in a middlegame; the instructive manu als tend to use either a completely closed posi tion (favouring the knight), or a fluid one in which the bishop has wonderful scope. The fact is that it is not practical to describe the multitude of intermediate positions which the profes sional player must become accustomed to and hone his judgement about. Perhaps the first thing which we should consider is how likely it is that an ending will arise with one of the fol lowing configurations: ir'+i. vs ir'+ll:\ (this is relatively rare; it was discussed in Part 1); .l:t+i. vs .l:t+ll:\ (which Steve Mayer calls 'the grind able ending', the side with the bishop being better in most cases); 2l:r.+i. vs 2l:+ll:\ (which several authors point out is even more favour able for the bishop); and finally, i. vs lZ:\ with only pawns. With the exception of the first (rather rare) case, these situations all tend (sta tistically) to favour the side with the bishop. With that in mind, we might conclude that it is in the interest of the side with the knight to achieve something concrete in the middlegame, for example, the crippling of his opponent' s pawns, rendering the enemy bishop passive, or winning a permanent outpost. Both Mayer and Dvoretsky consider the question of how the side with the knight can play to balance the scales. Mayer presents the following position: E. Jimenez - Larsen Palma de Mal/orca 1967
164 SECRETS OF MODERN CHESS STRATEGY
Here Black (who stands reasonably well in any case) goes for the knight versus bishop: ... i.xe5!? 15 dxe5 d4! Larsen exclaims: "Advantage for Black! He has the initiative in the centre and both the white king's pawn and his pawns on the queen side are weak." The game continued: 16 i.h6 1Ud8 17 i.xe6 fxe6 18 l:lfe1 l:ld5 19 .tr4 :rs 20 g3 .:.rs Now it is true that the bishop on f4 is moder ately 'bad' (too many pawns on dark squares), and yet Black's weakened kingside and lack of a square for his knight (like b3 or c4) makes the assessment a bit unclear. After the correct move
21 h4 ! (which was not played), the problem
with capturing a pawn on e5 is that Black's dou bled e-pawns are then well and truly exposed. As a matter of principle, however, play in which the side with the knight grabs space and maintains some tension (as in this example) is generally preferable to drifting towards the ending, unless that side can achieve a strong and permanent outpost for his steed before he enters the pure ending phase. Yusupov (in Positional Play, co-authored with Dvoretsky) gives two extremely interest ing examples from his own games of the same bishop vs knight material imbalance. The con trast is instructive due to the very similar pawn structures in the two games (arising from com pletely different openings): Vusupov - Lautier Amsterdam 1994 White has a bishop-versus-knight situation, and Black has no obvious outposts. In top-flight modern chess, it has become ever more critical for the owner of the knight in such situations to create immediate counterplay. If he fails to do so, the general outline of the game, repeated in countless contests, is as follows: 1) White (once the knights are restricted, or at least, relatively harmless) gains space with a general pawn advance on one side of the board . 2) The bishop and knight combination threatens to force a fatal weakness in Black's structure on that part of the board. 3) Ultimately, in desperation, the second player tries to counterattack, but the bishop proves its superiority in tactical situations with pawns on both sides of the board. It is characteristic of the modern grandmas ter that he can win such games with the bishop. Consider our recent world champions. What odds would one give any player with Black in such a position against Fischer, Karpov, or Kasparov? The fairly universal prejudice for the bishop among top players really began in earnest with Botvinnik, and has only increased since his time. Many of Fischer's most famous wins, for example, were with a bishop versus a knight. Nunn comments: "Everybody knows that in an open position a bishop is generally slightly better than a knight, but Fischer showed that this applies in a wider range of positions than was previously thought. He was particu larly skilful in endings of rook and bishop against rook and knight, and won a number of these." Of course, since Fischer's time tech nique has only improved; and all the world's leading players are now adept at converting the bishop-versus-knight imbalance. Returning to the diagram, let's look at this game to see both what happens and how Black might have better reacted:
15. .. tDc6?
Yusupov criticizes this move on the grounds that "the knight attacks nothing, prevents noth ing, and is severely limited by the enemy bishop." He points out that this was Black's chance to use the knights against White's only weakness by placing them on b6 and d6. After 15 ...lDc8 !, he believes that White only has a small advantage, for example, 16 .l:f.hb1 lDd6 17 i.a5 .l:f.dc8 18 .l:f.b3 �f8 1 9 f4 �e7 20 e4 f6! 21 .l:f.ab1 l:.ab8. This brings up the interesting point that, were both the white and black c-pawns
BISHOPS VERSUS KNIGHTS 1: ONE-ON-ONE 165
protected (say, by pawns on b3 and b6), White's advantage would be all the greater. Weak squares and isolated pawns tend to fa vour the knight, even if both sides have them in equal measure. I think that students tend to get confused about this point. They view a position with split pawns on both sides as more 'open' and therefore favourable to bishops. But in re ality, what bishops tend to want is stability. That is because if short-term tactics are un available, then (in the absence of strong out posts) time generally favours the bishops. We will discuss this idea further as we get into the next chapter. After 15 ...lbc6, the game continued: 16 :hb1 llab8 17 :bS! a6 Weakening b6, but there was no choice. 18 l:txb8 l:txb8 19 g4!

Here is Yusupov's next example: A. Sokolov - Yusupov Candidates match (game 3 ), Riga 1986 What a difference it makes to have White's pawn on e5 instead of e3 ! Now Black does have a potential outpost (d4) for his knights; more over, the e-pawn can be a target in some lines. Finally, White's bishop is restricted by that same pawn; compare the last example, in which pressure along the long diagonal had decisive effect on Black's kingside, even in a simplified position. These differences are not enough to give Black the advantage here; but as in the Larsen example above, they make the simple weakness-free bishop-versus-knight squeeze impossible, and give Black enough play to even the chances. Let's follow the game: 16 �e4 After 16 l:td1 Yusupov gives 16. . .lbbc6!? 17 ..Be3 'it'a5, as well as the simpler 16. ..�xd3 17 l:txd3 lbbc6 18 i.e3 l:tfc8 ! with equality. 16 ... lbd7!

While we're in Yusupov Land, let's look at a more recent example (D): This position might be more appropriately placed in a chapter dealing with the centre, but
166 SECRETS OF MODERN CHESS STRATEGY
w Yusupov - Khalifman Ubeda 1997 it emphasizes one of the most common patterns in modern chess. White begins with a central advantage and better-placed king. This may not seem like much, but here it proves sufficient. First, notice that the e4/d4 complex gains strength in this phase of the game, since the two pawns are now easily defended (whereas in the rniddlegame, they require constant supervision). Another important point concerns White's a pawn. Theoretically, it is the only weakness on the board for either side, but as Mayer says, "modern grandmasters have demonstrated re peatedly that 'a weakness is not a weakness' if it can't be exploited." As the game goes, White gains space and creates a central passed pawn (another factor which is generally important in the ending, but often overrated in the middle game). At some point, White's consequently greater freedom of action forces the exchange of Black's bishop for his knight. Then we get to see a top-flight example of how the bishop versus-knight endgame wins so often for the bishop, and why the side with the knight gener ally can't afford to wait for simplification. The other modern aspect to this position is that it is really just a standard one. Both sides know from vast experience (especially with the Griinfeld Defence) that such a centre, against precisely this black pawn structure, gives White a serious, if not necessarily winning, advan tage. Such knowledge from concrete examples typifies modem grandmaster play. Having said all that, let's see the further course of the game: 27 g4! An interesting and typical starting point. Al though the most obvious play for White con sists in probing the queenside and advancing the centre pawns, Yusupov's initial step is to tie down the kingside (incidentally gaining space). He prevents the space-gaining . .. h5, and dis courages . . .f5 as well, since that otherwise might transform the central situation to Black's advantage. 27 .. .'�e8 28 i.c4 ti:Jb8 29 �d3 a6!?

32. .. a5 33 i.d5! i.xd5 34 ti:Jxd5 e6!?
Perhaps 34. ..i.f8 was better. After White's next, he not only has the target on b6 and an outpost on b5, but Black's weakness on d6 is very hard to cover. 35 ti:Jc3 ci;; c7 36 ti:Jb5+ �c6 37 �c4 i.f8 38 i.f4 Now the problem is d5+ and then i.d6 or ti:Jd6+. 38 ... i.b4 39 f3 i.f8 40 d5+ Also 40 i.d6! ? was promising, in view of 40 ...i.xd6? 4 1 d5+. 40 ... exd5+ 41 exd5+ �b7 42 ti:Jd6+ i.xd6 43 i.xd6 Now we have bishop-versus-knight with pawns on both sides of the board. That is bad enough for Black, but here g5 threatens to tie down the knight permanently, so Black's next is forced.

Now one can see why, in the next chapter (about the bishop-pair versus the knight-pair), I put an emphasis on the side with the knights making direct pawn-breaks and forcing con frontation early on, as opposed to the tradi tional advice of trying to close the position. If one plays too slowly, endings such as those above tend to arise, in part because it is usually easier for a bishop to exchange itself for one well-posted knight than vice-versa. So the side with the knights is generally better off trying to secure concrete positional advantages before such simplification occurs. I'll close this section with a brief example of Black trying to follow that philosophy with his lone knight versus a single bishop: w Glek - Djurhuus Copenhagen 1996 The stereotyped view of things would have it that White wants to open the position for his bishop and Black would like to keep everything closed. But as the play goes, Black resists that temptation (which so often leads to the type of ending we've just looked at) and consistently hamm ers away at White's pawn structure to en hance his own knight's status:
18 c4 dxc4! 19 .txc4 ltb8
Threatening ...l?:Jxd4 !. 20 .i.b5 ti::J a5 A knight on the rim! Shades of Chapter 5; here it controls the key c4-square and prepares to dominate the light squares. Hence: 21 c4! White correctly ignores the a-pawn. He would love to play c5 in conjunction with dou bling on the b-file, but Black reacts actively: 21 ... f4! 22 c5 'ii' f8! 23 l:.b4!? According to Djurhuus, 23 exf4 'ii' f6 is un clear. Once White's centre disappears, so do his threats. 23 .•.fxe3 24 'ii' xe3 'ii' f7 25 l:.ebl l:.hf8 26 'ii' el?!

28 c6?? An oversight. Black would have been some what better after Djurhuus's 28 llb3 ! .l:td5 29 .l:tf3 l:.f5 30 :xf5 'ifxf5, with a small advantage due to pressure on d4 and the misplaced rook on a4. 28 ... .l:txd4!

The moral of this game, active play to justify the knight's existence, will be expanded upon next chapter, in the context of the knight-pair.
7 Bishops versus Knig hts 2 :
Minor-Piece Pai rs In this chapter, we continue our discussion of the modern treatment of bishops and knights. Our topic is bishop-pairs and knight-pairs, be ginning with the cases in which they are set against one another. At the end of the chapter, I will revisit the bishop-pair in the context of po sitional pawn sacrifices. Against all Odds : Championing the Steeds We have seen in Chapter 4 how big an advan tage the bishop-pair confers. Examples of this are legion, and as I indicated there, the theoreti cal dispute over whether bishops are generally better than knights has been resolved in favour of the prelates. But a statistical superiority says nothing about individual positions. Disre garding the abstract superiority of the bishops, the best modern players are familiar with many types of positions in which knights are accept able or preferable. This section examines the contexts in which the contemporary master chooses to cede the bishop-pair. I will divide this topic into three subsections, designated 'a' to 'c', of which the last is the most important (and most modern). Briefly de scribed, 'a' involves the side which acquires the knights simultaneously obtaining an outpost or fixed weaknesses in the enemy camp, and thus being able to stabilize the position to advan tage; 'b' features some other countervailing ad vantage for the knights, normally space or central superiority, and 'c' includes the accep tance of the knight-pair for the sake of superior activity and initiative, which may then be trans formed into another type of advantage, such as those described in 'a' and 'b' . Since top players are not inclined to cede major weaknesses, case 'a' is relatively infrequent, but important to un derstand, as the exemplary positions may be re garded as a sort of long-term goal for the side with the knights. This is the sort of thing we usually see in instructional and middlegame books. For balance, we will also look at some marginal examples in which the side with the knights isn't able to achieve what he wants. Case 'b' is more common than 'a' in modern play, since both sides have advantages and it is unclear whether the bishop-pair or the space advantage will carry greater weight in succeed ing play. Finally, case 'c' is quite typical and of the utmost interest, since the instability of such positions makes an assessment extremely diffi cult, and thus there tend to be takers for both sides. As this topic is of vital interest to contem porary chess, each part is illustrated with nu merous examples. a) Classical Case: Permanent Weaknesses Traditionally, middlegame books give some ex ample in which the knights have excellent out posts versus an opponent with blocked bishops and/or a crippled pawn structure. This might be considered the 'classical' grounds for accepting the two knights versus two bishops, i.e., that the side with the knights already has, or will ac quire in a few moves, permanent advantages such as those described above. In practice, this certainly occurs, although generally, the side with the bishops is not so hopelessly tied down as he is in those textbook examples. The assess ment of realistic positions depends upon whether the bishops can nevertheless achieve compensating activity. We will begin by examining some modern examples of this sort of position, in which the side with the knights is primarily concerned with preventing attacks or freeing moves by his opponent. This situation typically arises when the side with the bishops has been saddled with a pair of doubled pawns, as in the following game:
1 70 SECRETS OF MODERN CHESS STRATEGY

l2Jc6 6 lDf3 i.xc3+ 7 bxc3 (D) This is a wel!-known Nimzo-Indian Defence position. Black's sixth move, ceding the bishop pair without even waiting for White to lose a tempo by a3, was played by Nimzowitsch him self, but didn't attract attention again for sev eral decades, until Hiibner showed that Black could maintain surprising control of this kind of position. White would seem to have ample opportunity to break open lines, say, with f4; but because White is already saddled with the doubled c-pawns which are permanently block aded, Black is able to adopt the strategy of con solidating that advantage by trying to close or at least stabilize the position. 7 ..•d6 8 e4 eS 9 dS A committal move. Needless to say, there are alternatives, but I want to get to positions in which White has the sort of permanent weak nesses which are the subject of this section. 9 ... l2Je7 10 l:tb1 Black's idea is that after 10 O-O, the bad white bishop on d3 and static pawn structure are real liabilities, e.g., 10 ...l2Jg6 l l lDel O-O 12 g3 (White feels that he must open lines with f4)

In all of these cases, White is hurt by his inability to advance his pawns and free his bishops, often as a con sequence of immobile doubled pawns. Note that the doubled pawns in the above cases had to do with the centre, and some were even targets along an open file. If I were to give a cautionary warning about ceding the bishop pair for doubled pawns, it would be that doing so to obtain doubled rook's pawns is often not worth it. Here's an example: Vermolinsky - Dolmatov PCA Qualifier, Groningen 1993

to counteract his kingside weaknesses (12. ..l:.ac8 intending . ..&i:Je7 and ...i.b5 has also been played). This line seems quite acceptable at the B time of this writing. But naturally, exposing one's king in this way is rare. A very ambiguous version of conceding the bishops arises when the side giving up the bish ops inflicts doubled pawns which are not sub ject to attack, nor even fixed. Here's a radical, ultra-modem example. Larsen - Betancort Lanzarote 1976

4Jf6 6 i.b2 O-O 7 d3 e6 8 i.xc6!? A truly remarkable notion. This time there is no chance of winning the black c-pawns, but Larsen (a disciple of Nimzowitsch) hopes to es tablish a sort of general restraint. 8 ... bxc6 After 8 ...dxc6, White has various ideas; in my English Opening book, I gave 9 4Jf3 tDe8 'ii' d2 b6 1 1 'ii' e3 f6 12 O-O-O e5 1 3 l:.dg1 ! ?, with the idea g4-g5, h4-h5. 9 "ii' d2 d6 This may not be as accurate as 9 ...e5, when Black should have equal chances.

Black doesn't want to wait around for moves like tDe4 or tDa4 and i.a3, so he sacri fices a pawn for activity: 17 •.. e4 18 tDxe4 i.xb2 19 �xb2 f5 20 tDc3 tDe3 21 l:.cl "ii' f6 22 "ii' e1 aS 23 �a3! The key defensive move, intending tDa4. White had a clear advantage and went on to win. At the top levels, rarely does one side allow an exchange of bishop for knight which shatters his pawns and leaves him with only losing chances. But here's an example of just that: Anand - Kasparov PCA World Ch match (game 1 7), New York 1995 The champion, overrating the bishop-pair, played: 16 ... b5? This allowed: 17 i.xf6! exf6 17 ...i.xf6 1 8 4Jd5. 18 4Jde2! This was probably what he missed; 1 8 4Jd5 'ii' xd2 1 9 l:.xd2 tDc4 20 i.xc4 bxc4 intending .. .f5 was unclear, according to Anand. 18 ... l:.c6 19 4Jd5 'it'xd2 20 l:.xd2 Black has given up d5 and ruined his own pawn structure with very little counterplay for the bishops. Just to illustrate how difficult it is to defeat the bishop-pair, White failed to find the most accurate way to maintain these advan tages and Kasparov escaped with a draw. 20 ... 4Jc4 21 i.xc4 bxc4 22 l:.ed1 f5 23 exf5 i.xf5 24 4Jd4 i.xd4 25 l:.xd4 l:.e2 26 l:.4d2 l:.xd2 27 l:.xd2 �f8 28 �cl? 28 4Jb4 ! was correct, as Anand demon strated in lengthy analysis. 28 ... i.e6 29 l:.d4 i.xd5! 30 l:.xd5 �e7 Although White is still better, it was not enough for Anand to win the game. Occasionally, there arise positions in which one static weakness justifies the ceding of the bishop-pair. In Alekhine's Defence, for exam ple, the line 1 e4 tDf6 2 e5 t0d5 3 d4 d6 4 .!iJf3 i.g4 5 i.e2 c6 6 O-O i.xf3 7 i.xf3 dxe5 8 dxe5 e6 (D) somewhat strands White's e-pawn in a semi-closed position.
BISHOPS VERSUS KNIGHTS 2: MINOR-PIECE PAIRS 175
w Whether this fully compensates for the two bishops is not completely clear, but the neces sity of defending e5 can tie down White's bish ops. If White tries to remain active, Black's pressure is usually justified, e.g.: Mestrovic - Kneievic Yugoslavia 1981 9 'i!Ve2 lbd7 10 c4 lbe7 11 b3?! Apparently bad. 1 1 it.d2 intending it.c3 may well be best here, but then the bishop is rather passively placed. 11 ... lbg6 12 it.b2 'ii c7 13 it.h5 It's too late to defend the e-pawn by 13 .l:te1 because of 13. .. it.b4. White tries for active play based upon f4-f5. 13 ... lbdxe5 14 f4 lbd7 15 f5 O-O-O! Uh-oh. Now 16 fxg6 hxg6 wins the piece back, so White is reduced to recovering his pawn in a miserably underdeveloped position. 16 fxe6 fxe6 17 'ii' xe6 it.d6 18 it.xg7?! Probably 1 8 'ii' h3 lbf4 19 'ii' h4 should be tried, but Black is clearly better. 18 ... .l:thg8 19 it.h6 it.xh2+ 20 'iii> h1 it.e5 21 tbd2 it.xa1 22 %ba1 lbf4 23 it.xf4 'ii xf4 Black converted his material advantage into victory rather easily. Of course, there are other types of static weaknesses which justify taking on the knights against a bishop-pair, the simplest case being when the knights blockade an isolated central pawn (this is usually about equal). The key (and slightly unusual) condition for such a static treatment is that the bishops are not able to free themselves, even in the long run. b) Space/Centre for Bishops: An Obscure Trade-off In this situation, the side with the knights achieves no solid outposts, nor does his oppo nent have weak pawns. However, there are a number of positions in modern chess in which a player may take on the knights for other reasons, most notably an advantage in space and/or cen tral control. If one's goal is to tie down a bishop-pair, it turns out that in practice, one will normally not attempt to lock up the whole pawn structure (which turns out to be impossible in practice and also allows the bishop-owner a certain grace period in which to organize his pawn-breaks). Rather, a good way is to control so much space that pawn-breaks which might otherwise favour the bishops are suppressed. With enough space, additionally, one's own pawn advances tend to force the creation of fa vourable outposts, since they can be supported by pieces with more scope and mobility. In some cases, the attempt to avoid such weakness grants the side with the knights a strong attack. This technique of using pawn advances to force concessions is the same used in case 'c' below. Finally, there are some rock-solid central struc tures which in and of themselves restrict the bishops and therefore ensure equality. Nevertheless, the situations described above can always betray the side with the knights if the bishops get loose. This may happen, for ex ample, after a dynamic pawn sacrifice to free the bishops, or simply by transition into an end game, when the bishops are often a winning ad vantage and other factors become irrelevant. Let's look at some examples of space advan tage first: lvanchuk - Dreev Linares 1997

Of course, White knew that Black would castle queenside in the face of the space grab on the kingside. But the fourth-rank pawns still serve a purpose.

Ideally, a freeing move follows which either creates weaknesses or ac tivates the knights enough to equalize. Statis tically, the bishops will probably retain some advantage in most of these types of positions, but there are specific variations in which the knights can hold their own. This rather unin spired strategy is used by Black in a few open ings, notably the Slav and Caro-Kann, both of which can lead to the sort of pawn structure seen in the next game. Beliavsky - Z.

There are also cases in which the knights support a semi-closed structure with a space advantage on one wing. This co mes up in several Queen's Gambit lines, as in the following example: Van Wely - Gelfand Tilburg 1 996

The examples in 'a' and 'b' have been char acterized by a lack of direct confrontation. Typically, the side with the knights restricts the bishops' possibilities, but there is little forcing action to create weaknesses or outposts. In the next section, we see a much more radical strat egy. c) Reversing the Conventional Wisdom The most typical and frequently-arising two knights strategy is completely ignored by mid dlegame books. It is when the side with the knights is able to exploit a temporary advantage (normally a lead in development, which arises for reasons described below) in order to blast open the position and dynamically achieve con cessions from the side with the two bishops. This leads to a sort of modern quasi-principle which I first talked about in my 1981 book Queen 's Gambit: Chigorin Defence. At the time, I was considering the following position, arising after 1 d4 d5 2 c4 lt:Jc6 3 lt:Jf3 i.g4 4 cxd5 i.xf3 5 gxf3 'ii' xd5 6 e3 (D):

Black faces a choice between 6 ... e6 and 6 ...e5. Soltis had called 6 ...e5 'illogical' since, he said, "Black should seek a closed position where the white bishops will be restricted." Let me quote at length from my own words there (with the promise not to do so again!): "In my opinion, 6 ...e5 is quite logical and in- deed theoretically preferable to 6 ... e6, i.e. better by reason of general principle ... Given that a game is in the opening or early middlegame stage (i.e. that not too many pieces and pawns have been traded), it tends to be desirable for he
BISHOPS VERSUS KNIGHTS 2: MINOR-PIECE PAIRS 179
who has acquired the two bishops to immedi ately close the position, and for he who gains the knights to immediately open it. "This may seem paradoxical, since text books are forever emphasizing that bishops like open positions and knights like closed ones ... But a careful look at modern chess reveals that, in practice, the acquisition of the bishop-pair is usually followed by a slowing down of the play, while he who takes on the knights will strive to open things up and 'mix it' . This is for a good reason. Acquisition of the two bishops in the early part of the game often comes at the cost of tempi and/or balance in one's position. If the two-bishop owner can lock things up a bit, he can reorganize and carefully engineer an open ing of the position which will emphasize the bishops' natural superiority. This is precisely what the possessor of the knights wishes to avoid. Time favours the bishops, but early in the game, they are often passively placed, needing some tempi to find their best posts. Knights, on the other hand, have a certain native flexibility and tactical 'reach' which allows them to create threats and force concessions before the bish ops are ready. For this, open lines are needed to allow the cooperation of the other pieces. Often by, e.g., breaking in the centre, the knights' owner will be able to force enemy pawns to ad vance, creating permanent outposts for the knights, at which point they are no longer infe rior pieces to the bishops, even in the long run." This holds up well today, although I'd proba bly phrase it a little differently now. For exam ple, I'd replace 'close the position' with 'stabilize the position' , since the real goal for the side with the bishops is to avoid dynamic pawn-breaks by his opponent. Chess opening theory is replete with examples of such pawn breaks for the sake of gaining outposts and/or activity for the knights, so much so that they swamp the number of counter-examples in which the owner of the knights scurries to close the position. As seen above in case 'a', the latter situation does arise, but only under certain re stricted circumstances. I would now modify my 'principle' above to cover case 'a' by adding that in general, if upon the acquisition of the knight-pair its owner already has a permanent outpost (as in the Karpov-Browne example in 'a'), or if the side with the bishops is already crippled with a permanent and exploitable weakness (as in the Hubner Variation of the Nimzo-lndian, also described in 'a'), then an attempt to keep the position closed may be ad visable. But otherwise, central pawn-breaks and other line-opening moves tend to be correct. Let me show what all this means by example. Returning to the last diagram, the Chigorin Defence was the original battleground for the dispute between Chigorin and leading players of his day with regard to the relative merits of bishops and knights. Today, it is still instruc tive. After years of experience, the line-opening move 6 ... e5 is well established. Play usually continues: 6 ...e5 7 t2Jc3 .tb4 (D) Now two variations will illustrate Black's knight-pair strategy: 1) 8 a3 2) 8 ..td2 1 )

Opening lines! Again, one might think that, with c5 firmly under control, Black would play solidly and keep things closed, as in section 'a' above. But time favours the bishops, and before White completes his development, Black forces him to make further weaknesses.

BISHOPS VERSUS KNIGHTS 2: MINOR-PIECE PAIRS 181
Let's move on to a more standard opening, in � • which Black rushes to concede the bishop-pair A for only the slightest crippling of his oppo- B nent's pawn structure. In the English Opening after 1 c4 e5 2 ltJc3 ltJf6 3 g3, 3 . . . .Bb4.(as op posed to 3 ...d5 or 3 ...c6) has been called the 'Modern Variation' . It was little-used until Smyslov and others revealed its potential in the 1 960s. After 4 .i.g2 O-O, White has the clamping move (a la Botvinnik) 5 e4!?, when 5 ... .i.xc3 6 bxc3 (D) would at first appear to be promising for White, supporting his bishop pair with a broad central pawn-mass. For example, 6 ...d6 7 d3 liJbd7 8 h3 ltJc5 9 ltJe2 .Bd7 1 0 .Be3 .i.a4 1 1 ..Rd2 .:es 12 O-O liJfd7 1 3 f4 a6 14 f5 f6 15 g4, and White simply rolled up the kingside in Tukmakov-Vasiukov, USSR Ch, Moscow 1969. Here Black wrongly allowed White to stabi lize the position. The right solution was to open things up, exploiting his temporary lead in de velopment, even at the cost of liquidating White's doubled pawns. Let's see how this works: 6 ...c6! 7 ltJe2 d5! 8 cxd5 cxd5 9 exd5 ltJxd5
10 O-O ltJc6 11 J:[bl (D)
Now Black has a central advantage, with particularly good prospects of using the light squares. If White tries 1 1 d4 instead, 1 1 . ..exd4 12 cxd4 .Bg4 ! creates further weaknesses (after f3, the e3-square on an open file and the iso lated d4-pawn guarantee Black the better game). So White tries to activate his rook. ll. . . ltJb6 In the game Budnikov-Naumkin, Lloyds Bank Masters, London 1993, Black put similar pressure on the light squares: 1 1 ... .:b8 ! ? 12 .i.a3 .l:te8 1 3 .l:tb5? ! ( 1 3 c4 tllb6 14 d3 .Bf5 15 .l:tb3 was suggested, but then Black has won the d4 outpost, enhancing his knight-pair) 13. ...i.e6 14 'ii' b 1 ..Rd7 15 .!:tel a6 1 6 llb2 b5 17 d3 .Bf5 (or 17. ..Bg4 ! ?) and Black was better. Note how his central pressure and open lines are soon converted into outposts for his knights and good squares for his bishop: 1 8 ..Wd 1 .Bh3 ! 19 ih 1 .Bg4 20 "ii d2 l:'Lbd8 ! ? (20 ...tllb6!) 21 .Bc5 ! 'i!Rf5 22 f3 .Bh3 23 J:[d l h5 24 .Bf2?

In each example and note, Black converted his development and pressure into control of a colour-complex. The rigidity of White's pawn structure was caused by Black's early opening of the position. It was White's turn to play with these same ideas in the following game: Fischer - Spassky Match (game 1 1), Sveti Stefan/Belgrade 1992

'it'xd1 19 :axd1 �e7 20 ltlxh8 :xh8 21 ltlf5+! gxf5 22 exf5+ �e5 23 f4 ...and White was winning the ending. Without even knowing the theory, one can well imagine that a slow white build-up (with, say, d3, ltlbd2, b3, and �b2) would never have created the activity and prospects for the knights that Fischer's violent line-opening did. Here's another top-class English Opening with ...�b4 and ...�xc3: Kasparov - Karpov World Ch match (game 16), Seville 1987
1 c4 e5 2 ltlc3 ltlf6 3 ltlf3 ltlc6 4 g3 �b4 5 �g2
O-O 6 O-O :e8 7 d3 �xc3 Another voluntary exchange, to try to dam age White's pawn structure. 8 bxc3 e4 9 ltld4 h6 To prevent �g5. Now Black would like to play 10. ..ltlxd4 1 1 cxd4 d5, so White plays an odd-looking move: 10 dxe4! ltlxe4 11 'it'c2 (D) An interesting position. At ftrst glance, one might think that Black's play consists of block ading the position (particularly c5) with his knights, closing the position, and then target ing the c-pawns. But that would give White the time he needs to activate his bishops and hurl his e- and f-pawns forward. The correct solu tion opens the position and voluntarily liqui dates White's doubled pawns for him: l l. ..d5! This greatly increases the knights' effective ness. Now, for example, ...ltla5 is a real threat to win the light squares, so White has to react quickly. 12 cxd5 White's bishops would be passive after 1 2 :d1 ltlxd4 1 3 :xd4 'ii' f6 14 e 3 �f5 ! , and 1 2 �e3 ltlxd4 1 3 cxd4 ( 1 3 �xd4 �f5) allows sim ply 13. ..c6, with the positional threat of ...ltld6 (White's bishops are again passive).

Note that once White exchanges his light-squared bishop, he cracks open lines and at the same time puts his pawns on the light squares.

An elegant game. Once one begins to examine modern chess, one sees this idea - the side with the knights opening lines - in just about every opening. Even in optically bad positions, one should usually strive for open lines, as in this simple example: Yudasin - Av. Bykhovsky Beersheba 1996 In this game, Black has somehow lost all the kingside dark squares. Given a few moves, White will win by some combination of c4, unleash ing the bishops, and aS, activating the rooks; even f3 and g4 is ultimately a threat. Should Black try to hunker down against this, and keep the position as closed as possible, say, by ...c6? That will certainly lose in the long run; instead, the key is to open lines:

Black, with a strong centre and active knight, has achieved approximate equality. Not surprisingly, the Nimzo-Indian is replete with examples of two knights pitted against two bishops, as that imbalance arises after ...i.xc3. What might nevertheless surprise the reader is in how many of these lines, Black (with the knight-pair) strives to open the position. We have already seen the classical Nimzo-Indian case of a fixed queenside pawn structure in which Black attacks doubled white c-pawns, say, by ...i.a6 and ...ltJa5. But far more com mon are fluid pawn structures in which Black must act quickly, time being on the side of the bishops. Middlegame books generally ignore this more typical case, probably because fluid play is always harder to describe than static play. To get a flavour for how the modern Nimzo-Indian is actually played, let's look at a string of examples from the highly-topical 4 'ii' c2 variation. Kramnik - Anand Linares 1998

That this concept is at least plausible is shown by the fact that on move 8, White very often simply declines to take on c6. 7 i.g5 i.b7 8 ltJf3 Recently popular again. Another illustration of our theme followed 8 f3 h6 9 i.h4 d5 10 cxd5?! exd5 1 1 e3 .l:.e8 12 i.f2 c5 ! and Black, due to his development and the opening of the e- and c-files, was already slightly better in Seirawan-Karpov, Rotterdam 1989; here 13 dxc5? d4! 14 'ii' d2 dxe3 1 5 i.xe3 'ii e7 is just bad for White. 8 ... d6 9 ltJd2 ltJbd7 10 f3 (D) 10 ...d5 Psakhis gives the instructive line 1 0. ..c5 1 1 e4 cxd4! ? 1 2 'ii xd4 'ilc7 1 3 i.e2 .l:.fe8 14 O-O d5 15 exd5 exd5 with equality.

However, 10. .. d5 is still more direct.

A line such as 12 i.e2 cxd4 13 exd4 ( 1 3 'ii' xd4 e5) 1 3. .. dxc4 and ....l:.c8 shows how easily Black can create weaknesses and win squares such as d5. And after 12 cxd5, both

16 i.f2 a4 (D) Clamping down on the queenside. This kind of position has arisen time and again; Black usually has just enough play to make up for the bishops, due to his superior centre and space on the queenside.

Here are some more radical ex amples of 'speeding up the knights' in the 4 'ii' c2 Nimzo-Indian: Miles - de Firmian Interzonal tournament, Manila 1990

lt:Ja6 6 a3 i.xc3+ 7 1i'xc3 tL:lxcS 8 f3 dS!? Years of theory have confirmed that the slow approach by 8 ... d6 allows White to get devel oped and gradually utilize his bishops, e.g., 9 e4 e5 !?

O-O 13 tL:lc3 with advantage, Flohr-Botvinnik, Match (game 6), Moscow/Leningrad 1933. So de Firmian introduced 8 ...d5 ! ?, which tries to interfere with White's standard build-up before he gets developed. The goal is to speed up the knights, and the best response is to try to slow them down. 9 cxdS b6! The point. 9 ...'iixd5 10 e4 is clearly better for White. 10 b4! ? This is hard to resist, but another pawn move may not be best. First, notice that 10 dxe6 i.xe6 is extremely difficult for White; Black has a huge lead in development and White's queen is a target, while moves like ...tL:lb3, ....l:.c8, and ...tL:ld5 or ...lt:Jh5 loom. And after 10 e4, de Firmian gives 1 0. ..exd5 1 1 e5 lt:Jfd7 12 lt:Jh3 O-O 13 i.e2 .l:.e8, and Black is better. The best move is probably 10 i.g5 !, to catch up in development and simplify after e3 and tLle2 with a well-timed i.xf6. This would 'slow down' the knights and take advantage of the more static pawn structure.

So I will just give the moves with minimal notes, for the reader's enjoyment. 17 f4!?

First, it's worth pointing out that instead of 6 ...lbe4, slow moves such as 6 ... O-O have always been considered inadequate, precisely because if White is allowed to develop, he has the bishop-pair at no price. But in the diagramm ed position as well, modern theory is focused en tirely on lines involving a quick central pawn break by ... e5 or ... c5. The long investigation of this ancient line has convinced leading players that opening the position by radically changing the pawn structure is Black' s only correct course. Here's one of the main lines: 7 ... lbc6 To illustrate my point, look at Black's two other main lines here. One is 7 ...c5 !? 8 dxc5 ltJc6 9 cxd5 exd5 10 lDf3 i.f5 1 1 b4 O-O 12 i.b2, another well-investigated variation in which Black relies on opening the position and rapid development. If White gets his pieces out, he wins, but the amazing continuation 12. .. b6! ? 1 3 b5 bxc5 14 bxc6 'ii' a5+ 1 5 ltJd2 l:tab8, sacri ficing a piece, is still being debated at the time of this writing; thus far, Black is holding his own. Also very interesting is 7 ...e5 ! ? (another line-opener! ). Then Atalik-Shaked, New York 1998 continued 8 cxd5 'ii' xd5 9 e3 exd4 10 ltJf3 ltJd6 1 1 ltJxd4 i.d7 12 i.d2 ltJc6 13 ltJe2! ? ( 1 3 ltJxc6 i.xc6 14 f3 O-O-O is fully equal) 1 3. . .i.f5 14 'ti'c1 ltJe4 lf2-lf2; Black may even have a slight edge. 8 e3 The older line with 8 lDf3 e5 9 dxe5 i.f5 10 Rb3 provides a good example of how the knights benefit from development and play on a colour complex (here, the light squares).

Unlike some other examples we've seen, White has plenty of his own tactical chances here, mainly by direct attack against the king. In the latest game with this line, White won by means of a beautiful attack: 16 ... �h8?! 17 dxe5 �e6 18 lDf3 'iVxhl 19 lDg5 g6 20 lDxf7+! l:txf7 21 �xe6 .l:tg7 22 �f7! l:txf7 23 e6+ �g8 24 'iVd4 �f8 25 exf7 'it;xf7 26 'iVd7+ 1-0 Atalik-Sax, Szeged 1 997. A good reminder that sometimes, the open position does favour the bishops; ev erything depends upon the specifics. Now it's up to Black (who until just recently was on top in this line) to find a better path if he can. This variation may well be one of those where the dynamic balance is never decidedly in favour of one side or the other. Other examples of lines which have been threatened with 'refutation' time and again, and yet continue to flourish, are the Sicilian Najdorf (particularly, the Poisoned Pawn), the Botvinnik Semi-Slav (where theory is out at move 35 in some equal ending!), the Sicilian Dragon (various lines are ultra-critical, but Black keeps surviving), the French Winawer Poisoned Pawn, the Sicilian Sveshnikov Varia tion, and critical variations of the Exchange Griinfeld. It seems that if an opening survives 10 or 20 years of refutation attempts, that usu ally indicates that it has the fundamental posi tional strength to survive indefinitely. For more on the subject of long-term dynamic balance, see Chapter 10. The main point of this lengthy discussion of 4 'iVc2 is that in every line we've considered, slow play by Black has proved insufficient, and the fight against the bishops is therefore best conducted in open, hand-to-hand combat. Nothing could be further from the old stereo type of knights liking closed positions. This is also evident in the Rubinstein Varia tion of the Nimzo (4 e3 ). Here, for example, is a specific manoeuvre with is absolutely standard now, but only became so in modern practice: 0gaard - Flesch Oslo 1974

This is a typical pos1t10n with hanging pawns, of a type that arises from several varia tions. Black now takes the opportunity to 'speed up' his knights: 15 ... �xf3!? 16 'ii' xf3 e5! The prying-open move. As the next note shows, this kind of combination has to be spe cifically calculated for each position. 17 �e3?! Flesch claims that this is forced, but in fact, it leaves Black better. True, 17 dxe5 lDxe5 and
18. ..l2Jxd3 obviously favours Black (White's a-

and c-pawns are isolated). But 17 d5 ! looks much better to me. Flesch gives 17 ...e4 ! 1 8 .i.xe4 lDe5 as favourable to Black, but 19 'ii' f5 ! seems to compel 19 ...lDxe4 ( 1 9. ..lDxc4 20 .i.d3 'ii' e5 2 1 l:.fe1 ) 20 .i.f4! (perhaps what Flesch missed; although White is also at least equal and possibly slightly better after 20 'ii' xe4 l2Jxc4 2 1 .i.c3, among others), when Black must try 20 ...l2Jf3+ 21 gxf3 l2Jd6. Unfortunately, after 22 'ii' e5 l:r.fd8 23 �h1, for example, Black may be able to draw (23 .. .f6 is a good start), but he will tend to be slightly worse in various endings. It's interesting that other commentators have simply copied Flesch's assessment after 17 d5 e4 18 .i.xe4 l2Je5. I don't think this spoils the thematic importance of the ....i.xf3 and ... e5 idea, however. It simply means that in this exact position, the effect is unclear. Another option for Black after 17 d5 might be 17 ...lDe8 ! ?, to prepare ...f5 (17. ..lDc5 1 8 .i.f5 and 1 9 .i.g5 is not attractive), e.g., 1 8 .i.c3 l2Jd6 19 l:.fe1 l:r.ce8 intending ...f5. For the research-minded reader, by the way, a famous example of almost exactly the same ....i.xf3 and ... e5 theme is Portisch Karpov, Bugojno 1 978. Returning to our game: 17 ... exd4 18 .i.xd4 lDeS 19 'fif5 lDxd3 20 'ii xd3 Instead, 20 .i.xf6 allows 20. .. 'ii f4 !

w Now Korchnoi points out the consolidating move 27 .. . 'ii' c4 !, after which Black is better, one of the more interesting lines being 28 i.d2 l:tb8 29 l:tb4 'ir'a2 30 l:tb3 l:tfc8 3 1 i.c3 (3 1 d5 l:tc2 32 l:td3 l:txb5) 3 1 ...a5 ! with a clear advan tage. Well, there is a limitless supply of such ex amples. We have already looked at some of these elsewhere. For example, in the main lines of the French Winawer ( 1 e4 e6 2 d4 d5 3 ll:lc3 i.b4 4 e5 c5 5 a3 i.xc3+ 6 bxc3), we have seen that Black (with the knight-pair) normally seeks active play via ...f6 and often foregoes ...c4, even though White already has a static weakness in the doubled pawns on c2 and c3. The opposite strategy, closing the position by ...c4 and leaving out ...f6, allows White plenty of time to regroup and use his bishops to win on the kingside. Along the same lines, I would like to remind the reader of the old-fashioned Exchange Ruy Lopez that we examined in Part 1 , Chapter 4. Without revisiting all the issues that accompa nied 1 e4 e5 2 ll:lf3 ll:lc6 3 i.b5 a6 4 i.xc6 dxc6, it is interesting to look at that variation in the light of this chapter's concepts. Experience teaches us that, despite the old precepts against opening lines for the bishops, the most effective lines for White involve d4, not d3. In fact, Black will often respond to d4 by trying to keep the position as stable and as closed as possible. He sometimes does this by .. .f6 and ...i.g4, for ex ample, even ceding his precious bishop-pair rather than unleashing the dangerous knights by ... exd4. Even when he does play ... exd4, Black's role in most games is to slow the play down, whereas White will throw his pawns for ward to create better posts for his knights (see especially the Fischer-Spassky example in that chapter). As usual, the philosophy with the bishops is that there will always be time to open things up later, e.g., by a general pawn advance on the queenside. One might wish to return to that chapter to see how the ideas of this one ap ply. Vengeance of the Bishops After a chapter of mostly favourable positions for the knight-pair, I want to examine the mod ern pawn sacrifice for two bishops. Doing this will remind us that in the majority of cases, the bishops are a positive force, so much so that modern players freely give up pawns (and even the exchange - see the next chapter) in order to unleash their power. The choice of great games in this category is so wide as to reduce an author to tears. Ulti mately, I grabbed games pretty much at random out of a long list of candidates. Let's start with Kasparov, who loves such sacrifices. Kasparov - A. Sokolov Belfort 1988

It is a sign of the increasing sharpness of modern chess that up until 20 years ago, White would almost always try to preserve his pawn here by either 5 f4 or 5 d4 cxd4 6 'ir'xd4, even though these lines promise very little against a knowledgeable opponent. 5 ... ll:lc6 6 d4 This sacrifice is the modern way to treat the position. At the time this game was played, the way in which Kasparov now proceeds was well-known, but its theoretical status was in Black's favour. 6 ...cxd4 7 ll:lxd4 ll:lxe5 8 ll:ldb5 Now White secures the bishop-pair. 8 ...a6 9 ll:ld6+ i.xd6 10 'ii' xd6 f6 11 i.e3 ll:le7 12 i.b6 ll:lf5 The moves up to this point are well-known. For some time, White would enter a pawn-down ending by 13 i.xd8 ll:lxd6 14 i.c7 at this point, but ultimately, this was shown to be equal for Black.

A good illustration of how the bishops can be a decisive force in and of themselves. Black has only a slightly weakened pawn structure (in response to White's queen-bishop battery, of course), and yet the bishops rake his position. White's pressure is long-term, as will be seen. Black now reorganizes. 15 ... 'ii' d6 16 'ii' b3+ �h8 17 O-O l2Je5 18 h3! This move restricts the squares to which Black's bishop can go.

A typical reader, having slogged through this very lengthy chapter and the three before it, might therefore ask: 'OK, but what' s the message here? What should I do with my minor pieces? Give me some guidance ! ' . This is not primarily intended as an instruc tional book, but let me talk about instructional books for a moment. To address the subject be fore us, the handling of minor pieces, such books almost inevitably make the same presen tation, along the lines of: 'Are bishops better than knights? It depends upon the position.' They then proceed to state that bishops like open positions and knights like closed ones, af ter which follows a set of ridiculously one sided examples to prove that point (normally with the inferior side having additional weak nesses). And that's the extent of it. As Suba complains about rniddlegame books in general, they teach 'only the art of playing against very weak opposition', i.e. someone who has given us every advantage which we could desire, without bothering to create counterplay. So the first question for those of you looking to improve your game is: do existing instruc tional books help by showing you such unam biguous examples? My answer would be that, above the 1 800 level, this is at best only mar ginally helpful. Good players won't give you such a stereotyped minor-piece advantage; and if you go by rules like 'open the position when you have the bishops' , or if you dawdle and try to 'close the position when you have the knights', you will consistently be killed by play ers who understand how seldom and poorly such rules apply. The point is, there's no easy answer to genu inely improving your game, with respect to mi nor-piece play or otherwise. As a teacher, I know that students are always looking for con venient generalities to 'get a handle' on chess and its intricacies. But if there is a practical side to this book, it is the message that abstract rules and principles are of limited usefulness. Expe rience and thoughtful study will provide you with a better and more delicate positional judgement than a set of rules ever could. Good players look at concrete sequences of moves and assess the resulting positions, not accord ing to some artificial construct about which piece likes which kind of position, but in line
196 SECRETS OF MODERN CHESS STRATEGY
with their own judgement, refined by years of thinking about similar positions. If you are fa miliar enough with the relevant type of posi tion, then you won't need a rule; if you aren't, then your own judgement (based on the concrete situation before you) will be more trustworthy and precise than any rule you could employ. Therefore, although you won't instantly handle your minor pieces better by reading this chap ter, its study will at least add to your repertoire of positions and the concepts tied to them. Hopefully, you might also develop a more open mind towards the possibilities inherent in mi nor-piece positions. I would view with suspi cion any chess book which claims to do more than that.
8 The Exchange Sacrifice
The increasing frequency of the exchange sac rifice is probably the most widely-acknowledged change in modern chess technique. Fortunately, so many books and articles have covered this phenomenon that I need not justify it as a valid concept. Moreover, you need only pick up an lnformator, or any magazine with recent games, to find good examples of exchange sacrifices. In what follows, I have therefore chosen to con centrate on the historical evolution of the ex change sacrifice. We will see how its function has changed over the years, and how current players are employing it in ever more imagina tive ways. First, what do we mean by an 'exchange sac rifice' ? Obviously, the sacrifice of a rook for a bishop or an knight. But in this book, we are not concerned with such a sacrifice if it is immedi ately followed by a mating attack, or by the achievement of material superiority. For this reason, the term 'positional exchange sacrifice' is sometimes used, to indicate that the ex change is given up in order to establish long term advantages which the sacrificer hopes will ultimately repay him. Indeed, most of the ex amples below are of this nature. But I should add that one can sacrifice the exchange for a long-term initiative or attack, in which the pri mary justification is tactical rather than posi tional, even though the resolution of that attack cannot be accurately foreseen. In such cases, the compensation may have a positional basis, for example a dangerous knight outpost next to the enemy king, but I think 'long-term' best de scribes the set of sacrifices we will be con cerned with here. Origins Was the exchange sacrifice unknown previous to the modern era? Of course not, but the reader can conduct an experiment which is perhaps more powerful than any statistics I could quote. Look through a book of classic brilliant victo ries from before 1 935 and see how many of them include an exchange sacrifice (in the long-term sense described above). One might also look at the World Championship matches up to that time for the same purpose; or exam ine collections of games by Lasker, Tarrasch, Rubinstein, Capablanca, or any of the other masters of the pre- 1930 era. Now do the same thing with a book of famous victories from, say, the last 30 years; and examine the games collections of Botvinnik, Petrosian, Karpov, Kasparov, or indeed, of any modern grandmas ter. This exercise should dispel any doubt that the exchange sacrifice is part and parcel of modern chess in a way that it never was before the 1930s. Another telling indication of change in the attitude towards the value of the exchange ap pears when we look at the analysis of the older masters in tournament books, games collec tions, and opening books. Time and again, vari ations are dismissed because one side or the other wins the exchange, although the other side might have a pawn, active play, and an 'ob viously' better game if that exchange is cap tured. Certainly one of the repeated errors of early opening analysts is that they considered some line or other inferior or not worthy of at tention because they failed to appreciate power ful compensation for the exchange. Today, the exchange sacrifice is so second-nature to the professional that this type of oversight is much less common. It is instructive to search pre- 1 930 databases for successful exchange sacrifices. Almost with out exception, we find compensation only from direct mating attacks and/or the immediate ac quisition of at least two pawns for the ex change. Long-term sacrifices are seldom seen; one feels that this simply must reflect a pre modern attachment to static material evalua tions. There are nevertheless a few precursors of the modern attitude. Tarrasch himself, in an notating a game between Janowski and Lasker from 1909 (won by Janowski, the exchange down), commented that a knight in the middle
198 SECRETS OF MODERN CHESS STRATEGY
of the board, protected by a pawn and out of the range of any enemy pawn, is nearly as strong as a rook. And once in a while, we see a quite modern-looking idea: Selezniev - Alekhine Triberg 1921 The position looks innocent enough, and one might expect mass exchanges along the b-file. Instead, Black uncorks ... 20 .. J:tb4! We should not be surprised that Alekhine, who shared so many stylistic characteristics with modern players, would find this shot. The first point is that if White doesn't take the rook, 2 l ..J:tfb8 intending ...l:tb2 will force him to do so. 21 i.xb4 cxb4 Now White is an exchange up with even pawns. So what is Alekhine's idea? He wants to gain certain positional advantages, namely, use of the c5-square as a powerful knight outpost, a protected passed pawn on b4, the two bishops, and pressure on White's now-backward c4- pawn along an open file. In addition, White's bishop is bad on d3, and his a-pawn is more vul nerable than it was, due to the possibility of ...ti:Jc5. 22 ti:Jd2 ti:Jc5? This shows that Alekhine was not depending upon lengthy calculations, but made his sacri fice on principle. In fact, this knight move al lows a clever reply. Alekhine shows that the correct sequence was 22 ....l::t c8 !, to pressure the c-pawn, when ...i.c3 or ...ti:Jb6 will follow, with the subsequent win of a pawn. Black would have more than enough play for the exchange in that case. 23 ti:Jb3! Alekhine had missed this. Now on 23 ...ti:Jxa4, White plays 24 tal ! ti:Jc5 25 ti:Jxa5 i.xal 26 .l:txal (threatening i.xg6) 26 ...Rg7 27 ti:Jc6 with advantage. So Black voluntarily loses a whole tempo:
23. ..
ti:Jd7 24 c5! Freeing the d3-bishop. Black wins a pawn, but he no longer has White so tied down. Still, his powerful bishop and well-placed knight gives him compensation for the very slight ma terial deficit. 24 ... i.xd3 25 exd3 dxc5 26 l:tfel If 26 'it'c4, Alekhine had planned 26 ...'ti'd6!, intending 27 ti:Jxa5 ti:Je5, hitting f3 and d3. 26 ... ti:Je5 (D) 27 .l:te3 Alekhine gives the line 27 'it'xc5 ti:Jf3+ 28 Wfl 'ii' xc5 29 ti:Jxc5 ti:Jd2+ 30 Rg2 ti:Jxbl 3 1 .l::t xbl .l:td8 ! as better for Black.

Trying to maximize the power of the bish ops. Now 24 'ii' xe4? i.d5 will win the queen, so White must play passively. This position has a modern look, in that Black's two strong bishops and potential passed pawn on the queenside of fer more than adequate compensation for the exchange. In what follows, the play is not terri bly accurate, but Black wears down the white defences and wins without too much trouble. 24 .l::t f2 i.d3 25 'ii' d2 b4!?

More recently, a number of top players have made a living off exchange sacrifices; McDonald's Positional Sacrifices, for example, devotes a whole chapter to Kar pov's efforts in this regard. Today, in fact, every top player looks for opportunities to benefit from an appropriate exchange sacrifice. But the first world-class player to draw attention to a new assessment for this material imbalance was Botvinnik. He was, to be sure, only one contributor to a conceptual revolution originat ing with Soviet players in the 1930s and 1940s, and in fact did not often offer his rooks for mi nor pieces. But several of his games captured the new spirit and strongly influenced genera tions to come. w Tolush - Botvinnik USSR Ch, Moscow 1945

Black has gone to a lot of trouble to grab a pawn in the opening, and now he faces some difficulty in countering White's activity. With the next move, White aims his bishop at the sensitive dark squares. 18 �cl a5 19 �a3 .:tb6 Now 20 �d6 can be answered by 20 .. Jhd6 with two pawns for the exchange. White's next move strengthens the �d6 idea and threatens 'ir'gS. 20 'tWg3 'tWd8 21 �d6 .:txd6! Anyway ! This is the sort of move that com puters still don't suggest, even as a fourth op tion. After all, there are no threats and Black is a pawn up. But the modern player knows from experience that, in the long run, White can ad vance on the kingside and activate his bishop pair. By giving up the exchange, Black changes the equation completely, because he gets a pawn and long-term chances on the queenside for the exchange, and most importantly, he can completely neutralize White's chances. 22 exd6 �c6 23 h3 'it>d7! 24 l:tel 'ili'h4!

Liublinsky - Botvinnik Moscow Ch 1943 This example is perhaps over-used in the texts, but it is a forerunner of hundreds of simi lar sacrifices. Black has been outplayed, and is now faced with threats like 'ii' f2 and lt:Ja4, win ning the c-pawn. Black's bishops are just pa thetic, stuck behind their own pawns, and White's position has no weaknesses. One would expect White to win this position over 95% of the time; for example, what if he takes the rooks off on the open file? Black can hardly live with his pawn weaknesses in a simplified position. But Botvinnik finds an all-star defensive solu tion: 25 ... .:td4!! So simple, and yet shocking at the time. If White takes the enemy rook, Black's pawns are straightened out (with a protected passed pawn; compare the Alekhine example above), and his two bishops will actually have something to do. 26 lt:Je2!? Soltis approves of this move, saying 'better to give up a knight than a bishop'. In fact, al though the move itself is not bad, the idea be hind it is bad. As others have pointed out, 26 �xd4 ! cxd4 27 lt:Ja4 was correct, so that after lt:Jb2-d3, the knight can take up an ideal block ading post on d3. Black could still try to scare up play by, e.g., 27 ...c5 28 lt:Jb2 �b7 with the idea 29 lt:Jd3 (the prophylactic 29 .:n! .:tf8 30 .l:.ael is a nice alternative) 29 .. .f5 30 .:tel l:Z.f8, perhaps hoping to swing the bad c7-bishop

around to e3 via g5. Of course, White is simply better if he plays carefully, but not so easily as he would have been had Black omitted 25 ... l:[d4. 26 ... �c8 27 lt:Jxd4?! Of course, White hasn't lost anything after 27 �xd4! cxd4, when again I like 28 l:.fl ! �e6 29 l:.ae1 f5 30 lt:Jcl . Alternatively, White could play for queenside expansion. 27 ... cxd4 28 �f2? Now this move, generally ignored, strikes me as a very serious mistake. As Euwe and Nunn point out, White needs to break on the queen side. A plausible sequence would be, for exam ple, 28 �d2 c5 29 a3 f5 30 l:.db1, to meet the game plan 30. ..f4 (30. .. 'iii' h8 is better, but 3 1 l:.b2 still prepares b4) with 3 1 b4 ! axb4 3 2 axb4 cxb4 33 'ii' b3, etc. After the text move, Botvinnik shows what two bishops and a kingside advance can do. 28 ... c5 29 :n f5 30 �g3 �d7 31 l:.adl f4! 32 �f2 g5 33 g4?!

In The Middle Game, for example, Euwe seemed compelled to pro claim: ''The advantage of the exchange is deci sive. There can be no two opinions about this, and it is necessary to begin this chapter by stat ing it definitively." Why was this necessary? Because Euwe was uncomfortable with all the games coming out of the Soviet Union in which the side the exchange down kept winning ! And he was quick to add something that wouldn't have been in the old manuals: that having the two bishops and a protected passed pawn or a weakened enemy king position "must be reck oned as full compensation". Remarkably, in the very short introduction to the whole of Volume 1, he concludes with a paragraph on this very topic, stating: "Compensation for the exchange in terms of positional advantage is a theme which has attracted a lot of attention lately, especially on account of a number of games played in Russia. It seems that it is easier to ob tain full compensation than had formerly been supposed." Obviously, the issue was preying on his mind. Which is to his credit, because a lot of the western players didn't seem to fully catch on the new state of affairs until 30 or 40 years later. If I listed the early players from the USSR who contributed to the discovery of the count less types of positions in which the exchange could be given up for long-term play, I would undoubtedly omit some deserving names. Just to name a few, Boleslavsky, Bondarevsky, Lil ienthal and, a bit later, Bronstein and Geller were great contributors. Pachman points out these two examples from that era:

Today, even average players make such moves, an indication of the revolution which has taken place in the way that this material balance is assessed. 13 .txf8 'ii' xf8 14 ltJd4 $-c4 Black's compensation for the exchange is largely wrapped up with his dark-squared bishop, which has no counterpart and may be unleashed against the white king. This is a case where Black has no guarantee of not just ending up in an exchange-down ending, and whether 1 2. . . .th8 is completely sound is open to ques tion. In what follows, although both sides have alternatives on nearly every move, the course of the game itself indicates the kind of problems White faces. 15 g5!? ltJfd7!? 16 .th3 e6 17 'iti>b1 ltJe5!?

This remarkable genius of the game repeatedly broke through the material barrier, finding new ways to exploit the good qualities of his minor pieces against suddenly sluggish rooks. I will simply quote snippets from his own 1982 lecture on the subject (reprinted
THE EXCHANGE SACRIFICE 203
in Petrosian's Legacy), in order to bring his own ideas to the reader.
B
Reshevsky - Petrosian Candidates tournament, Zurich 1953 This is a famous example. Petrosian explains how he didn't like his position, and saw that White could play h4 next, provoking kingside weakness, followed by the return of his bishop to c l with attack. He then considered a number of ways to bring a knight to the ideal square d5. But playing 25 ... lbb8 (in order to follow up with ... lbd7-b6) allows 26 .i.f3 and d5, whereas a rook move like 25 .. J:tb7 (to bring the knight to d5 via e7) could run into 26 e6 (or 26 i.f3) 26 ... lbe7 27 .i.f3 ! lbd5? 28 .i.xd5 .l:txd5 29 'it'f3, winning. Ultimately, he played a move 'so simple, there was no doubt of its correctness' : 25 ... .l:te6!! Now we are in a different realm of creative sacrifices; I don't believe that this would have been played by another player in Petrosian's time, and probably by precious few today. The knight gets to d5 after all, supported by a stal wart pawn on e6 and an unopposed monster of a bishop on g6. Play continued:
26 a4 lbe7 27 .i.xe6 fxe6 28 'ir'n lbd5 29
ltf3 .td3 White now quite correctly returned the ex change (else ...b4 follows): 30 l::t xd3 cxd3 31 'ir'xd3 b4 32 cxb4 axb4 Black's far superior minor piece secures a quick draw. 33 aS l::t a8 34 :tal 'ir'c6 35 .i.cl 'ir'c7 36 a6 ..Rb6 37 .i.d2 b3 38 'i*'c4 h6 39 h3 b2 40 l::t bl 'iti>h8 41 i.e11h-1h An elegant masterpiece of strategy. In the same year, Petrosian played what would now be considered a 'routine' exchange sacrifice to win the centre and enhance his two bishops. He begins with a rook seemingly out of place on the fourth rank (see Part 1, Chapter 7 for more on such rooks): Troianescu - Petrosian Bucharest 1953 22 ... b5! 23 l::t d2 %tc4 24 a3 a5 25 lbe3 :xe4! 26 .i.xe4 .i.xe4 27 lbc2 d5 28 lbd4 b4 29 cxb4 axb4 30 a4 'i*'a7 31 'ir'f2 l::t c8 32 b3 .i.f8!

Black's pawns were much too strong; he won quickly. w More pathbreaking is the next example: Petrosian - Gligoric Varna Olympiad 1962 White is having one of those awful days against the King's Indian Defence. His minor pieces are vastly inferior, and his rooks are do ing nothing. Black intends to play something like ... l:af6, ... b6 and ... e4, and both his minor pieces are potential invaders on d3. Against Kasparov, one might just consider resigning ! But Petrosian plays the seemingly illogical... 26 �f3!! What's this? White walks right into ...e4. True, the immediate 26 ...e4 27 ir'd4! is not im pressive (27 ... lbd3 28 lbxe4 and White is actu ally better; compare the game). But what will happen if Black simply prepares it? 26 •.. l:af6 27 l:el ! ! Again, so simple, yet so difficult! The ex change is meaningless compared with the pos sibility of winning e4 for a knight and activating the light-squared bishop. Instead, 27 l:e2? loses to 27 ...�d3 28 lbe4 lbxe4 29 ir'xd3 lbg3+!. 27 ... lbd3 28 l:fe2 lbxe1 29 'ii' xel l:te8 30 c5 :rrs Petrosian: "If you have time to consider this position attentively, trying some lines, you should feel that the material plus means nothing." 31 lbe4 1h.-1h. Petrosian: "He offered a draw. There is no sense for White to reject this offer; he has no reasons to play for a win."
B
Portisch - Petrosian San Antonio 1972 White has been positionally better for some time, and now threatens to invade on e7. Petrosian realizes that this is his chance to turn the tables, and plays ... 24 ... e5!! 25 �e7?! Petrosian: "He [Portisch] cannot decide whether I have sacrificed the exchange or blun dered it away. Finally, after the game, Portisch said that he had decided that it was a blunder. .. ". In fact, White should resist the temptation and play something like 25 dxe6 .l:.xe6 with an un clear position. 25 ...f5 26 �xf8 lbxf8 "White has a rook for a minor piece but no active play: all the files are closed. The black pawn stands on e5, not e7, so the white knight on c6 is very beautiful, but nothing else. Situa tions might arise where Black could have an ex tra piece in action ... Black undoubtedly has the edge." Petrosian continued with ...�c8, ... lbfd7 and ... lbf6, but failed to advance his centre pawns accurately and only drew. Perhaps no other player had as many brilliant games which ended in a draw ! By the way, this position is also an example of the irrelevant knight outpost on c6, as discussed in the 'Optical Illusions' section of Chapter 5 . Of the following position, Petrosian says: "White has a great positional advantage. He practically has an extra passed pawn on d5 ... when the game has transposed into an endgame ... the passed, well-protected pawn can be deci sive."
THE EXCHANGE SACRIFICE 205
B
Tal - Petrosian Riga 1958 Here students of Nimzowitsch (or readers of any modern textbook) will quite naturally begin to think along the lines of the classic blockade by ... lbe8-d6 and perhaps trying to activate or exchange the bad bishop by ... i.g5 or ... i.h4 at some point. Well, neither of these plans can be achieved; but Petrosian figures out a way to jus tify the existence of his two minor pieces. Can you guess how?
2S ...
.:t.d6! A far-reaching and profound idea. Not only does Petrosian bring his rook over to a side of the board where it is supported by no other pieces and has no attacking chances, but he also plans to put his minor pieces on their 'worst' squares: the bishop on d6 and the knight on d7! We will soon see why. 26 lbb3 lbd7 27 .:t.aal l:.g6 28 .:r.n i.d6 29 h4 'ii' d8 30 h5 Tal naturally wants to make the rook look silly. 30 ... .:t.f6 31 'ii' g4 .:t.f4! Suddenly, the whole point! As Petrosian said 25 years later: "my mind worked some other way then"! 32 i.xf4!? Taking the bait. But the alternative 321hf4 exf4 33 i.xf4 i.xf4 34 1i'xf4 1i'e7 intending ... lbe5 would be unclear, according to Petros ian, and at any rate "better than a cramped posi tion with a material balance." 32 ... exf4 33 lbd2 lbe5 34 'ifxf4?! After 34 1i'e2, Petrosian gives 34 ... g5 or 34 ... 1i'h4. "Tal realized that events were taking a bad turn for him, so he tried to complicate matters." But in the ensuing complications, Black gains a pawn for the exchange with ex cellent attacking chances: 34 ... lbxc4 35 e5 lbxe5 36 lbe4 h6 37 l:r.ael i.b8 38 l:.d1 c4 39 d6 liJd3 40 'ir'g4 i.a7+ 41 �h1 f5 42 lDf6+ 'iii> h8 43 'ii' xc4 lbxb2 44 'ifxa6 lDxd1 45 \i'xa7 'ifxd6 46 'ifd7 'ii' xf6 47 'ii' xd1 .:t.b8 At this point, Black is much better, but he failed to convert the position to a win, once again only drawing ! Petrosian sacrificed many other exchanges, and of course, he often actually won the games in which he did so. Since his time, no top player has been able to ignore the exchange sacrifice, which has permeated modern chess. The Unfinished Product It would seem that the games of the last section would be hard to top. But modern chess has taken the exchange sacrifice and found ever more outrageous applications for it. Let's start with an example of exchange-down play in a simplified position. w Seirawan - Kozul Wijk aan Zee 1991 White to move has to deal with ideas such as ... e4 and ... 1i'd4. The most tempting move (which many players would conclude is forced) is 19 lbxb6 ! ?, with unfathomable complica tions. But Black seems to be holding his own after either 19. .. e4 (e.g., 20 f6 i.xf6 2 1 l:r.xf6 'ii' xf6 22 lbxd7 'ii' f2+ 23 'iii> h 1 exd3 24 'ii' g4+
206 SECRETS OF MODERN CHESS STRATEGY

Once you see White's strategy as a whole, this may seem obvious. But to give up the ex change in a simplified position without even winning the b6-pawn seems like sheer lunacy. 19 ... ibg4 20 hxg4 e4 21 .Be2! The whole point, which had to be foreseen. Taking the e-pawn would be suicidal, activating Black's rooks, and the 'natural' 2 1 f6 loses to 2 1 . ..exd3 22 fxg7 (22 lt:'lxb6 .Bh6 ! and ...e2, among others) 22 ... .l:lfb8 !, when Black's pawns are too strong.
21. ..
.Bxa1 22 .l:lxa1 .l:lab8 23 'it>h2 So what have we here? White would love to play 'it>g3-f4, with a dominating position (look at Black's 'good' bishop!). But what about try ing to free Black's pieces? 23 ... h5! 24 gxh5 .Bxf5 White is still a full exchange down, after all. At this point, White made a good move, but not the best: 25 �g3?! Seirawan mentions an incredible alternative here, which simply wins the game outright! Don't believe it? Here is his analysis (supple mented by my own): 25 l:tfl ! .Bh7 26 l:tf6! .l:lfd8 27 g4 ! �f8 28 �g3 <l;e7 29 l:th6 l:th8 30 g5 (D).
B
Now the drastic extent of White's bind has become clear. The move g6 alone is often enough to win, but White has the luxury of im proving his position as well, e.g., 30 .. .<i\.>d7 3 1 'it>f4 ! 'it>c7 32 rJi;xe3 l:tbg8 3 3 <J;;f4 e3 34 .l:.f6 and Black is helpless. The game was also instructive, but not quite as convincing: 25 ... 'it>g7 26 <J;; f4 .Bh7 27 g4! f6 28 lt:'lc3 'it>h6 29 lt:'ld1 l:tbe8 30 lt:'lxe3 l:.e5 31 l:tfl l:tg8 32 .Bd1 f5? 33 .Be2! ltg5 34 c5! bxc5 35 b6 !te8 36 gxf5 ltb8 37 l:tb1 l:tgg8 38 b7 <J;;g7 39 l:tb6 <J;; f7 40 .Ba6 'it>e7 41 .l:.c6 rJi;d7 42 .l:.c8 1-0 A brilliant effort. The exchange sacrifice seems to become ever more routine, and at the same time, ever more exotic. By this I mean that there are a great number of standard positions in which ex change sa�rifices are second nature, for exam ple, . . . l:txc3 in various Sicilians and especially in the Dragon Variation, or ... l:txf3 in a wide va riety of French Defences. In both of these cases, Black gains the advantage of split and doubled pawns in the enemy camp; but he also tends either to win a centre pawn or to gain con trol over key central squares. At the same time, every tournament brings us new and exciting ways to sacrifice the exchange. Let's look at a couple of examples of the more radical kind. The speculative tactical exchange sacrifice has become common. Not surprisingly, Tal pro vides us with an early, not fully sound, example:

Gligoric - Tal Leipzig Olympiad 1960 Black has all sorts of difficulties here, with the d6-pawn, among other things. Tal seizes the opportunity to change the dynamics of the con test in radical style:

23 ...c5! ? 24 bxc5 dxc5 25 .txd8 .td4+ 26 �hl .l:txd8 Well, this seems a bit absurd, since although Black has the two bishops, White has an out post for his knight on d5 and open lines for his rooks on the queenside. Objectively, White must be better. But the bishop on d4 has no counter part, and as long as White's bishop on f 1 can't be freed (by f4, for example), Black's minor pieces can create problems. How long his pres sure can last is illustrated by the game continu ation, which I will give without notes.

The next game illustrates this, in that Black's exchange sacrifice looks as crazy as the one by Tal, but seems to be objectively correct.

Here is a Karpov - Gelfand clever example: Linares 1993 Most players would play the 'forced' 20 i.d3 without thinking, and worry about how to B build up later. Karpov felt that Black would have good chances after 20. .. :g8 in that case, threatening ... f5. Instead, he found: 20 l:d5! As so often with Karpov, this is a prophylac tic idea to restrict Black's play. 20 ... l:he8 Temporarily, Black resists the exchange of fer. After 20 ... i.xd5 21 exd5 l:e7 22 l:d1, Kar pov assesses the position as clearly favourable to White. McDonald lists the following factors to support this assessment: a) all the squares along the e-file are cov ered, so Black's rooks lack effectiveness; b) the opposite-coloured bishops actually favour White's attack, and from d3, White's bishop can hit h7 or go to f5; c) White has a strong passed pawn in the centre; and d) Black's king is exposed. To this, I might add that White may be able to bring a knight via h4 to f5, from where it will dominate the board. 21 i.d3 l:d8! 22 l:d1 l:ed6 23 i.e2 i.xd5 White was threatening exchanges and cap ture on f7, and 23 ... l:xd5 24 exd5 'ii' d6 25 'i'c2 also obviously favours him. 24 exd5 'ii' b7 25 'ii' h4! i.f8 26 i.c4 l:xd5 Martin Gonzalez - Dolmatov Barcelona 1983 White is threatening 11 i.d3 and 12 gxf5.

The whole point. A bishop on f5 will be worth more than a rook! Although it would be a strong piece in any case, its enormous strength here also derives from the weakness of White's doubled c-pawns. Because of them, White will not be able to free his game, and at the same

He also allows the exchange of queens by 17 ii.h6 ii.g6 18 'ii' xf8+ .:lxf8, but then after White's bishop re treats, Black wins the c2-pawn and his bishop, knight, and rook on an open file will dominate the play, particularly with White's weak pawns. 17 'ii' e2 �h8 18 a4 ir'f7!

At no time in this game was either white rook the equal of Black's light-squared bishop. So many modern exchange sacrifices in volve getting two bishops and an attack that such a procedure seems almost trivial. The next game is typical in this regard, but has an extra twist.

9 Prophylaxis
This chapter may remind the reader of Part 1, in that I will treat the concept of prophylaxis in two stages: as Nimzowitsch first explicated it, and as it is interpreted in modern chess. We shall see that prophylaxis is explained differ ently by various writers, but it is safe to say that its modern application is more broadly applied than in Nimzowitsch's writings. This is an area of chess theory that is just beginning to receive serious attention. Nimzowitsch's Notion What do we mean by 'prophylaxis' in chess? Nimzowitsch spoke of the whole of positional play as "an energetic and systematic applica tion of prophylactic measures. What is impor tant above all else is to blunt the edge of certain possibilities which in a positional sense would be undesirable." As for the word 'prophylaxis' itself, Silman defines it as "A strategy explored by Nimzowitsch. Taken from the Greek word prophylaktikos, meaning to guard or prevent beforehand ... [a prophylactic move] stops the opponent from taking action in a certain area for fear of some kind of reprisal." These are rather all-encompassing defini tions which are indeed close to the modern use of the term. Tisdall is of the opinion that Nimzowitsch himself originally used the term more narrowly, "mainly expressed through his idea of over-protection, where the focus of the pieces is directed towards key points ...". Nimzowitsch did originally limit the applica tion of his concept, but not to overprotection alone. In My System, he states categorically that the undesirable possibilities which need to be prevented are "of two kinds only": "One of these is the possibility of the oppo nent making a 'freeing' pawn move ... the pre vention of freeing pawn moves (as far as this appears necessary and feasible) is of great im portance in positional play. Such prevention is ... an exterior prophylactic. It is much more dif ficult to grasp the idea of interior prophylactic ..." He goes on to define the 'interior prophylac tic' as the exercise of overprotection of one's own strategically important points, "by provid ing defence in excess of attack to lay up a re serve of defence ... weak points, still more, strong points, in short everything that we can include in the conception of strategically im portant points, should be overprotected. If the pieces are so engaged, they get their reward in the fact that they will find themselves well posted in every respect." [My System] So there are two quite distinct notions in Nimzowitsch's original argument: (a) preven tion of the opponent's freeing moves; and (b) overprotection of one's own key points. But the prevention of the opponent's plans in general, or even of dangerous non-freeing moves, is not mentioned; and that is the additional sense in which we use the term today. To some extent, Nimzowitsch himself cre ated this confusion. In Chess Praxis (where the concept of prophylaxis plays a bigger role than in My System), he begins to use 'prophylaxis' to include cases of preventing a particularly ag gressive plan by the opponent. If we look up the references to prophylaxis indexed at the back of Praxis, they show an interesting distribution. More than half of the examples are cases of stopping a freeing pawn move by the opponent. This is normally done by a rook move (often the so-called 'mysterious rook move' described be low), and occasionally by some other piece. But a minority of cases in Praxis refer to pre venting an attacking idea or even to such things as 'prophylactically' eliminating the oppo nent's two bishops, ideas not included in his original definition above. And overprotection, which now appears in only a handful of games, is not even coupled with the word 'prophylaxis' in Nimzowitsch's new exposition. Enough of definitions. Let's look at a few typ ical examples from Nimzowitsch himself (D): The following diagram is an example of pre vention of the freeing move. This is an uncon troversial case, but does illustrate the priority of
212 SECRETS OF MODERN CHESS STRATEGY
prophylaxis over development in certain situa tions. Instead of getting another piece out, White retreats an already-developed piece: 6 i.d3! This is primarily directed against the freeing move ... f5, but to some extent also against ... c6, since that can now be answered by c4. Nimzo witsch continues his analysis with ... 6 .. .tbf6 7 c4 O-O 8 lt:Jc3 lt:Je8 9 ii'e2 ... and White is fully prepared to meet Black's most natural freeing move 9. . .f5 by 10 exf5 i.xf5 11 i.xf5 .::t xf5 12 lbe4 with the better bishop and unassailable e4-square for his knights. 'The mysterious rook move' was one of Nimzowitsch's favourite devices, bringing a rook to a closed file in order to prophylactically discourage a freeing move by the opponent. It occurs often in Nimzowitsch's own games, usually in the opening, for example: Bogoljubow - Nimzowitsch Karlsbad 1929 Natural moves for Black might include 8 ... d6 or 8 ... i.e4. But in a highly original and modern way, Nimzowitsch finds a prophylactic solution: 8 ... .:te8! 9 .::t el Nimzowitsch says: "Black operates here and in the following play with prophylaxis ...", point ing out that Black has discouraged White's 'best' idea 9 lbd2 in view of 9 ... i.xg2 10 �xg2 e5!, when 11 e4 fails to 11. ..exd4 12 cxd4 lbxe4. 9 ...d6 10 'ii c2?! This loses time. Nimzowitsch likes 10 lt:Jd2 i.xg2 11 'iti>xg2 e5 12 e4lt:Jc6 13 i.b2 for White; but of course the bishop on b2 is awful, so it's hard to believe that White would stand better in that case. 10 ... i.e4 11 'ii' b3 lt:Jc6 12 i.fl e5 13 dxe5 lbxe5 14 lt:Jxe5 .::t xe5 15 i.f4 .:te8 16 f3 i.b7 17 .::t adl lt:Jd7 Now Nimzowitsch correctly notes that White's position suffers from a 'profound, in ner decay', and that after the inevitable e4, Black will eventually be able to get the advan tage by ... f5. That indeed happened in the game, which Black went on to win.
B
Przepiorka - Nimzowitsch Kecskemet 1927 Black sees e4 as White's only serious idea, and takes rather extreme measures to prevent it: 17 ... .::t f7!? 18 .:tact .::t af8 Now this is prophylaxis! Black bunches up his rooks awkwardly, just to prevent e4. But it's not clear that White isn't slightly better in any
PROPHYLAXIS 213
case. An interesting move now is 19 b5, for ex ample, thinking about a4 and either a5 or i.a3 and c5. 19 'i!r'd3 h5!? 20 e4? Nimzowitsch rightly criticizes this, suggest ing 20 e3 h4 21 'iti>g2 lDh5 with Black better. Actually, I think that 20 'ilr'd2! makes more sense than either of those moves, intending 20 ... h4 21 'i'g5!. Then 20 ... lDd7 is unclear, in some cases intending ... g5 with an attack. After 20 e4?, Black's prophylaxis was justi fied: 20•••fxe4 21 fxe4 lDg4 22 h3? lDf2 23 'ii e2 lDxh3+ 24 'ithl 'ir'g5 25 l:txf7 l:txf7 26 'ii' g2 lDf2+ 27 <Ji>gl 'ii' e3 0-1 One of Nimzowitsch's favourite examples was the following game:
B
Kupchik - Capablanca Lake Hopatcong 1926 It's hard not to like Black here, who has pros pects of ... a6, ...b5-b4 and opening lines on the queenside. Surely that's not a bad plan right away? But Capablanca sees more deeply. He perceives that White's only counterplay against this plan consists of some break with g4, in or der to activate rooks on the g-file and a bishop on c2. Thus, instead of going forward with his attack, he takes the opportunity to squelch all possible play by his opponent: 19 ... h5! 20 :ten l:th6! Given '!!' by Nimzowitsch, who comments: "the 'mysterious' rook move, for Black sees White's h3 and g4 coming, and he wants to be ready to attack on the h-file when this happens." Once White's kingside play fails, the game ends quickly: 21 .tel g6 22 i.h4 <;i(f7! 23 'ii el a6 24 i.a4 b5 25 i.dl i.c6 26 l:th3 aS 27 i.g5 l:thh8 28 'ifh4 b4 29 'it'el l:tb8 30 llhf3 a4 31 ll3f2 a3
32 b3 cxb3 33 i.xb3 i.b5 34 l:tgl 'it'xc3 0-1
Finally, an example that looks thoroughly modern: Nimzowitsch - J. Bernstein Karlsbad 1923 White, by playing an early b4, allowed Black a break by ... e5, which would normally equal ize. Now, having played ... e4, Black is naturally intending to play for a long-term attack by .. .f5-f4. Against this 'subjective majority', Nim zowitsch finds an excellent prophylactic idea: 12 lDh4! First, he threatens lD£5. 12 ... lDb8 13 g3 lDe8 14 lDg2 f5 15 h4! In Blockade, Nimzowitsch comments: "And Black's kingside, which was seemingly ready to march, is paralysed." Black can't even play the excruciatingly slow ...g6, ... h6 and ... g5 without allowing something undesirable, e.g., 15 ... g6 (15 ... h6 16 h5) 16 a4 h6 17 lDf4! <Ji>g7
18 h5 g5 19 lDg6, etc. So in the game, White
gets a free hand on the queenside. Although the prophylactic part is over, the game's course is both entertaining and instructive. For one thing, White's ability to advance pawns in front of his own king (due to his space advantage) harks back to Chapter 2 of this Part. 15 ... i.d8 16 a4 b6 17 b5! lDf6 18 lDf4 axb5 19 axb5 'ii' f7 20 i.e2 i.c7 21 cxb6 i.xf4 22

For one thing, people as sociated it with overprotection itself. Unfortu nately, overprotection has always been a rather vague idea, and only seems applicable to a nar row set of circumstances (certain positions with pawn chains or isolated central pawns). I think that if you asked top players, even today, if they felt that the idea of overprotection was an im portant positional concept, you might very well get a near-unanimous 'no' . But if you asked them about prophylaxis, the response would be much more positive. Pachman expresses the trend towards prophylactic defence as follows: "Just as in modern medicine, there is more and more emphasis on prophylactic measures to prevent rather than have to cure certain ill nesses, we see in modern chess strategy many preventive moves played to anticipate an en emy attack well before it has even started. This consists in strengthening the defence of any weak points which the enemy could attack, thus eliminating in advance the possibility of tacti cal threats which might occur later." The following diagram is an example of pro phylaxis in the early modern era (D): A fairly standard position from the Nimzo Indian. White has followed the usual plan (made famous by Botvinnik) of preparation for e4. At this point, he threatens e4, since after multiple captures on that square, Black's f7 hangs.

The opening is fairly typical of Petrosian, in that he has been deliberately provocative. Even by modem standards, his set-up looks a bit bi zarre. It seems that you could give Black sev eral moves and he wouldn't know what to do with them. But Petrosian is unfazed: 14 ... llb8! 15 libel llb7! There is an irony here, placing a rook vis-a vis White's g2-bishop. But Black's last two moves are the essence of prophylaxis. As Soltis comments: "Look around for an immediate threat to Black's second rank and you won't find it. But Black is thinking about the near fu ture." This use of the second-rank for defensive purposes has been mentioned elsewhere in this book and it also occurred in the last example. Here the rook not only defends d7, but is ready to swing into the centre or to the kingside when appropriate. White now jumps at the chance to activate his pieces at the mere cost of giving his oppo nent an extra pawn which is isolated and dou bled. But due to the prophylactic nature of Black's position, this also activates Black's pieces, and in particular that rook. 16 e5?! fxe5 17 tbg5 O-O 18 tbd5 tbxg5 19 .i.xg5 .i.e8! 20 .i.h6 e6 21 .i.xg7 llxg7 (D) w Black's last three moves prepared this! 22 tbc3 tbd4 23 llxe5 llgf7 Black is winning; the f-file pressure is too strong. 24 tbe4?

shows graphically how effective his trenchant approach could be:
B
Terpugov - Petrosian Moscow 1951 White has just played 15 l:Z.g3, obviously in tending to attack on the kingside. This may not look very dangerous, but just look to what ex tremes Petrosian goes to counter this, and then how quickly White's position collapses once the attack is beaten back: 15 ... 'it>h8! 16 .tf5 'ii' d8! 17 'ii' g4 l:Z.g8 18 'ir'h5 'ir'e8! 19 b3 .tf8 The best plans often look like ones which rank beginners would play! 20 'ji'e2 g6 21 .i.h3 f5 22 f4li::l f6 23 .:e1 fxe4 24 .txc8 'ii' xc8 25 li::l xe4 li::l xe4 26 Rxe4 .tg7 27 l:td3 l:tb4!

Today, thanks in large part to the games of Karpov and the influence they have had, 'prophylaxis' may refer to the process of frus trating the possibilities of the opponent, even if one has the better position to begin with. The Russian 'super-trainer' Dvoretsky and his GM pupils have written brilliantly about this aspect of modern chess, and reference to it appears increasingly in the notes of strong players. Indeed, much of the new awareness about prophylaxis can be traced to Dvoretsky's insightful and diligent work on this concept. I would also suggest that in the natural course of the evolution of opening theory, more energy than ever is being devoted to frustrating the op ponent's plans. To use the word 'prophylaxis' for this tendency may be an unjustified exten sion of Nimzowitsch's notion; but whatever we call it, this is a trend worth noting. Dvoretsky provides the following example: Botvinnik - Euwe World Ch match-tournament, The Hague/Moscow 1948
1 d4 d5 2 c4 e6 3li::l
f3li::l f6 4li::l c3 c6 5 e3li::l bd7 6 .td3 .tb4 7 a3 .taS 8 1i'c2 'ike7 9 .td2 dxc4 10 .txc4 eS 11 O-O O-O (D) w A rather normal-looking position, except possibly for the bishop on a5 . In fact, White's 9 .i.d2 might already be considered 'prophylac tic' ,-in that it is hardly very active, but prevents ...e4 for some time due to li::l xe4. At any rate, in this type of position, familiar from various Semi-Slav lines, one might consider a number of candidate moves. Those moves include 12 e4 (which is premature here), 12 dxe5 (freeing Black's game), 12 d5, 12 llae1, 12 .ta2 and 12 h3. In the last two decades, the move h3 has be come a common prophylactic idea, and this seems quite a good choice, intending 12 h3 .tc7 13 .ta2. Keres and Dvoretsky, on the other hand, convincingly argue that the best move is in fact:
PROPHYLAXIS 217
12 .i.a2! This has a number of advantages outlined in the next paragraph. But two of the world's great est players in 1948 chose neither 12 .i.a2 nor 12 h3 here! For example, Reshevsky (versus Euwe in the same tournament) played 1 2 d5?!, after which Keres points out three ways for Black to equalize: 12. .. .i.c7 ( ! - easiest, in my opinion), 12 ... .i.xc3 13 .i.xc3 cxd5 14 .i.b4 lLlc5 15 .i.xd5 lLlxd5 16 .i.xc5 'ikc7 (perhaps still a bit better for White after 17 l:tac l ), and 1 2. .. .!Lib6 13 .i.a2 .i.xc3 14 .i.xc3 lLlbxd5 15 .i.xe5 .i.g4. OK, but even the great Botvinnik chose 12 l:tael?! .i.c7 13 .!Lie4 ( 13 h3 ! ? - Dvoretsky; this looks better) 13. .. .!Lixe4 14 'ii' xe4, when instead of Euwe's 14. ..a5?!, both 14 ... .i.d6 and 14 ... .!Lif6 15 'ii' h4 e4 16 .!Lie5 .i.e6 are equal (Dvoretsky). So why 12 .i.a2? Because it prevents all of Black's ideas! For one thing, Black can no lon ger play ... .!Lib6 with tempo, and thus get his c8-bishop out. After 12 .i.a2 (D), look at Black's possibilities:
B
a) 12 ...e4? loses to 1 3 lLlxe4. b) 12 ... exd4?! 13 exd4, which tends to be di- sastrous for Black in any case due to l:tfe1 and .!Des or .!Lig5, is even worse when Black can't disentangle by ... .!Lib6 with tempo (and the a2- bishop can even go to b1 with mate threats in some cases). c) To prepare ...e4, Black might consider
12. ..h6?, but then 1 3 .!Lih4 ! threatens lLlg6 or
.!Lif5 with devastating effect. d) 12. .. .i.xc3, is depressing at best after 13 .i.xc3 e4 14 lLle5 (threatening .i.b4), according to Dvoretsky. From this point, I have analysed 14 ...a5 15 f3 ! (or 15 f4) 15 ...exf3 16 l:txf3 .!Lixe5 17 dxe5 .!Lid5 1 8 .i.d4 intending .i.c5 and e4, e.g., 1 8. .. .i.g4 19 l:tg3 'ii b4 20 .i.c5 l:tfe8 21 'ii' c4! h5 22 e4 b5 23 'ii' fl and White wins. e) 12 ... .i.b6 might seem reasonable, but then Black can hardly move, so 1 3 l:tae1 (among others) is strong; given time (which he has !), White can either play .!Lih4-f5 or go for the dou ble exchange in the centre followed by advance of his pawns by f4 and e4 . f) In view of the above, Black should proba bly try 12. .. .i.c7, when another advantage of .i.a2 is revealed: 13 .!Lib5 !? .i.b6! (13. .. .i.b8 14 .i.b4) 14 .i.b4 c5 'with a slightly inferior posi tion' (Dvoretsky). That is comfortable for White after 15 dxc5, but he also could play 13 h3 (a prophylactic move, stopping 1 3. ..e4 14 lLlg5 .i.xh2+ ), and challenge Black to prove what he is up to. In that case, I very much like White's position. Karpov is the player we most associate with modern prophylaxis; one feels that he would have played 1 2 .i.a2! in the position above (or at least 1 2 h3, which he has played in similar positions). As Nunn points out, he tends to eliminate the opponent's possibilities in order to pursue his own plans undisturbed, a style Nunn contrasts with the purely defensive pro phylaxis of Petrosian. We have already seen a wonderful and aggressive prophylactic effort by Karpov in his game against Hort in Part 1, Chapter 7. Here is another example: w Karpov - Vusupov USSR Ch, Moscow 1983 This is a game Yusupov himself uses to dis cuss Karpov as a 'prophylactic chess-player' .
218 SECRETS OF MODERN CHESS STRATEGY
White could now launch an attack with f4; but Karpov likes to stop the opponent's counter play, and since Black is threatening ... lba5-c4, he plays: 22 l:.tb1 b4 23 h3! Yusupov points out that this not only pre vents the active ... 'ii' g4, but it also creates a use ful escape square. Now Black does the same; but he later he considered 23 ... llb6 or 23 ... l:.a4 to be more accurate. 23 ... h6!? 24 l:.c1! More prevention! Now on 24 ... lba5, White plays 25 'ii' bl !, with the idea 25 ... lbc4 26 l:.xb4 l:.xb4 27 'ii' xb4 l:.xa2?? 28 'ii' b8+ �h7 29 'ii' bl +. 24 ... l:.b6 25 'iWb1 l:.ab8 Later, Yusupov preferred 25 ... l:.a4, but this was hard to anticipate.

As Yusupov says: "When you are not permitted to carry out your main idea it is very difficult to carry on the fight." 29 ..• lbe7 30 �h2 lbf5? A blunder, losing a pawn. Black should try 30 ...c6, although White will be able to advance his kingside pawns, now that the queenside is under control. The rest is basically technique, even if it becomes rather messy: 31 l:.bc2 l:.g6 32 l:.xc7 l:.xc7 33 l:txc7 'ii bS 34 g4! lDh4 35 l:tc8+?! 35 'ii' c5 ! would have won by force - Yusu pov. 35 ... �h7 36 'iWd1 'iWa6 37 l:.c2 fS 38 �g3! fxg4 39 �xh4 gxh3 40 f4 'iWe6 41 'iWhS 'iWe7+ 42 <Jixh3 "ikf7 43 l:.h2! 'iWd7+ 44 fS 1-0 w Karpov - Bagirov Riga 1970 Dvoretsky also discusses this position. The situation looks promising for White. Black's knight on b7 is severely restricted, and White has both space and a bishop vs a knight. But Black is threatening 27 ...a5 28 b5 a4 ! followed by ... lDc5, and in addition, the move ... f6 is an attractive freeing move, e.g., 27 'ii' d2 f6! . Kar pov prosecutes his advantage by squelching these ideas: 27 'iWg4! Now Dvoretsky points out that 27 ...f6 28 'ii' h4 lDg6 (or 28 ...h6 29 l:.fel) 29 �xg6 hxg6 30 'ifg3 favours White, as does 27 ...a5 28 b5 (or 28 'ifd4) 28 ... l:.fc8 29 a4. So Black tries to de fend against the most obvious white threat, 28 �xh7+ followed by 29 'ii' h4+ and 30 'ii' xe7. 27 ... f5 28 'iWd4! lbd8 29 bS! Pr:ophylaxis; Black wanted to play ... lbc6. The rest is a rather simple matter of dominating the queenside squares and pushing his pawns there through to victory: 29 ...g5 30 a4 lbg6 31 'ii' a1 'iWb7 32 .:.Ce1 'ilg7 33 lDcS l:.f7 34 aS l:.e7 35 lba6 .:.as 36 �n lDf7 37 lbc7 l:.d8 38 l:tc6 lDfS 39 b6 axb6 40 a6 lDh6 41 l:.ec1 lDg4 42 a7 lbxe5 43 l:.6c2 lbc4 44 aS'iil:.xa8 45 lbxa8 bS 46 l:.a2 l:.b7 1-0 Of course, not everyone can play like Kar pov. Svidler recounts how, in the recent FIDE World Championship knockout tournament in
PROPHYLAXIS 219
Groningen, he "got a sudden fit of prophy lacititis. Remembering the years when I was a student of a school of the Best Chess Trainer in the World [Dvoretsky - JW], I constructed the following logical chain ..." Svidler then de scribes how he followed a complex and entirely logical prophylactic chain of thought which, however, led to his blundering away a pawn in two moves ! One must always have the highest respect for tactics. As might be expected, Garry Kasparov is not known for a patient prophylactic style. But here's an example which could be straight out of a game by Petrosian or Karpov: w Kasparov - Anand Amsterdam 1996 This is a fairly normal type of position from a Caro-Kann Defence, Panov-Botvinnik At tack. White has space and a grip on e5, but as so often in these positions, the simple break by ... b6 threatens to expose drawbacks in his pawn structure along the a- and c-files. 13 l:tcl! Kasparov modestly gives this ' ! ! ' . It is in deed the kind of move which takes courage to play, shifting a rook to a completely closed file (a problem with these 'mysterious rook moves' , to be sure: what if they remain mysteri ous?). But it fulfils the primary goal of prophy lactic play: to stop the opponent's main plan. And more importantly, the details are bril liantly worked out.
13...b6?!
This is the move 13 l:tc 1 was designed to pre vent, so we'll make Kasparov's analysis of it our main line. Anand actually played 1 3. .. l:te8 ( ' ! ' - Kasparov ), but White maintained an edge after 14 l:te1 �f6, and now 15 �d3 ! was best, intending 15 ... b6 16 cxb6 axb6 17 �b1 , intend ing 'ii' d3. I think that the simple 13 ... lbe5 (!, intending 14 �xd7 lbxf3+) might have taken one of those '!'s away from 1 3 l:tc 1 ; but that's just a detail. The depth and beauty of Kasparov 's conception is still admirable. 14 e4! The point. Now we give the outlines of Kas parov's analysis. Note that the main line had to be foreseen precisely; this gives us a clue as to why White is the best player in the world:
14. ..
bxc5 After 14 ... dxc4, simply 15 �xc4 is clearly better for White, in contrast to 15 d5 lbb4! with unclear complications. 1S dxcS dxe4 After 15 ...a6 16 �a4 dxc4, 17 l:txc4 clearly favours White. 16 �xe4 �xeS 17 �bS 'fie7 18 'fie2 lbd4 19 'fixeS 'ii' xeS 20 l:txc5 lbxbS White's material triumphs after 20 ... �xb5 2 1 lbxd4 �xfl 22 �xfl . 21 a4! lba3 22 l:te3 The knight is trapped! This is only 8 moves after 1 3 l:tc 1 , but to be sure about such a calcu lation is a mark of greatness. We might also speak of a type of 'attacking prophylaxis', involving sacrifices to tie down the opponent. Here is a nice example: w Kasparov - Short Amsterdam 1994
220 SECRETS OF MODERN CHESS STRATEGY
A double-edged position. Black's central pawn-mass is apparently asserting itself, since 1 8 fxe5 can be answered by 18 .. .'iff4+ 19 <3i>b1 and either 19 ...'ifxa4 or 19 .. .'ifxfl , whereas something like 18 l:tf3 e4 19 :n 'ifxh4 20 'ili'xe6+ :n seems to offer Black enough play. Kasparov finds the ideal move to keep Black tied down: 18 f5! ! 'ir'h6+ His first point is 18. .. 'ili'xf5? 19 :f3 'ili'g4 20 l:txf8+ ltJxf8 21 tiJb6 and White wins. 19 <Ji>b1 l:.xf5 20 :r3! Slow and simple, cutting down on Black's play. Now 20 ... 'iff6 21 :xf5 'ii' xf5 22 i.e2! leaves Black at a loss for a move, e.g. 22 ... 'ili'f7 23 i.g4 ! tiJf6 24 tiJb6 ltJxg4 25 ltJxa8. But the game is very similar: 20 .. .lhf3 21 gxf3 ..Rf6 22 i.h3 <i;f7 23 c4! Cracking open lines. 23 f4 was another strong move. After the text-move, we return to a nor mal attack based on key squares and initiative. Black should probably keep lines closed by 23 ...d4, although 24 c5 ! is very good for White; again, Black has no counterplay. 23 ... dxc4?! 24 ttJc3! ile7 25 'it'c6 :b8 26 ltJe4 tiJb6 27 ltJg5+ �g8 28 'ii' e4! g6 29 'ifxe5 l:.b7 30 :d6! c3 31 i.xe6+ i.xe6 32 l:.xe6 1-0 On 32 ... ttJc4, White has a choice of wins, in cluding 33 'ili'xc3 !? ltJa3+ 34 �c1 'ii' d7 and now 35 l:.c6! or 35 bxa3 :c7 36 :e8+!. Finally, we have what might be called 'weird prophylaxis'! This is on the outer fringe of mod ern chess, and refers to cases when one player makes a move designed perhaps to render his opponent's most likely plans useless ! The move itself may be rather suspicious-looking and hard to fully justify. A brilliant example of this is given in the following game by Suba, who incidentally as a bonus provides us with some other delightfully modern moves: Suba - Petursson Thessaloniki Olympiad 1984

example, 9 ...cxd4 10 ltJxd4 ltJxd4 1 1 'ir'xd4 i.f6 12 'ii' c4 ltJxc3 1 3 bxc3 opens the b-file with ideas such as i.a3 and l:tfd1 looming. Then 1 3 .. .'ii'a5 14 i.e3 ! 'ii' xc3 15 'ii' a4 ! launched a terrific attack against Black's queenside in Suba-Cebalo, Skopje 1984 (the stem game for 9 l:tb1). And on 9 ... 'ii' a5, Suba gives the enter taining 10 i.d2 !, sacrificing the a-pawn for more than adequate compensation. Of course, 9 ... ltJxc3 10 bxc3 makes little sense for Black; and if Black passes, for instance, by 9 ... a6, then the move 10 e4 leads to advantage, in view of lines like 10. .. tiJb6 1 1 dxc5 ! 'ili'xd1 12 :xd 1 i.xc5 13 e5 ! intending ltJe4. Here the move 9 :b1 again shows its worth after 1 3. .. ltJc4 14 i.f4!, when b2 is defended. 9 ... i.f6 A very reasonable idea. Now Suba points out the move 10 e3, but the course he chooses is also logical. 10 ttJxd5 'i'xd5!? After this, White seems better. Suba men tions the idea 10 ... exd5 !?, and gives 1 1 i.e3 c4

In conclusion, the future of prophylactic moves and prophylactic thinking is bright. The fact that modern books and annotations in creasingly refer to such concepts indicates that they are now a permanent part of the new chess landscape. 1 0 Dynamism : The Modern Difference This chapter deals with the subject of dyna mism in modern chess. 'Dynamism' is a broad abstraction of the type I am not that comfort able with, but there are two reasons for focus ing our attention on it. First, it is the single word most associated with modern chess, and the de scription resorted to by top players and theore ticians when they are trying to describe the modern style. For that reason alone, we should examine what is meant by the term. But I have also found this topic to be a convenient excuse for showing the reader some exciting modern games. What is Dynamism? Obviously, dynamism has something to do with playing dynamically. Does that mean playing tactically? Let's hear what Suetin has to say about the difference: "The dynamic realization of possibilities dormant in the position usually takes place in a combinative manner. However, it would be wrong to equate this way of solving the problems of positions with purely tactical operations, although they resemble each other. The most essential characteristic of dynamic decisions consists always in the fact that they are connected with all the preceding strategic development of the game." In the context of to day's game, we see that more and more players today are employing opening strategies in which dynamic considerations predominate. Also, po sitions in which no tactics are directly involved can contain 'latent dynamism' , in that a player continually threatens to activate most of his pieces at once with a pawn move or sacrifice, and such threats must be constantly attended to by the other side. Many modern openings lead to these hidden dynamic possibilities, such as Hedgehog structures and dynamic counterat tacking openings like the 1\icilian, Benoni, and King's Indian Defences, to name just a few. To the outside observer, such positions always seem on the verge of 'boiling over' , even if no direct clash is taking place. As usual, it's interesting to look at this ques tion historically. There is surprising agreement among chess writers (Reti, Euwe, Romanov sky, Pachman and Suetin, for example) as to the general styles of the great players. They ac knowledge Steinitz as the founder of the posi tional school, with his identification of weak points, pawn structures, various static features, and above all, the theory of the accumulation of small advantages. To a great extent, his approach was extended and refined by Tarrasch, Rubin stein, Capablanca, and most of the best players of the first three decades of the twentieth cen tury. With the decline of the romantics (e.g., Zukertort, Blackburne, Marshall, and Chigorin), Suetin points out that Spielmann was one of the few defenders of a purely dynamic style of play during that period. And Nimzowitsch himself occupied a very interesting middle ground. As Romanovsky describes it, during the first part of his career, "his fiery temperament, dynamic thoughts, splendid and original imagination earned him deserved fame as an artist of chess." Later, according to Romanovsky, he "slipped into the position of a conservative ... he created the theory of restraint, blockade, overprotec tion ... By elevating these 'principles' in this way to the rank of dogma (as Tarrasch had done in his time. ..), Nimzowitsch came to suffer tell ing defeats when encountering opponents re nowned for great dynamicity [sic] of thought, particularly Alekhine." Perhaps a fairer way to characterize Nimzowitsch's transition would be that he moved from being an eccentric, dy namic player who often resorted to tactics to one who, like Steinitz, was obsessed with the static features of positions, sometimes to the neglect of dynamics. This new style neverthe less led to some beautiful and imaginative vic tories, which Romanovsky doesn't seem to acknowledge.
DYNAMISM: THE MODERN DIFFERENCE 223
At any rate, everyone agrees that the revolu tionary change in the realm of static versus dy namic play began with Alekhine, followed by the Soviet masters of the 1930s and 1940s. Suetin has some insightful observations about this subject. He points out that chess-players have always played mainly by intuition. "Obvi ously, the great master, endowed by nature, is an artist of the first class, to whichever school he may belong. It is for this reason that one comes across the elements of dynamics so fre quently in the games of Steinitz, Tarrasch, Rubinstein, and many other representatives of the positional school. If the problems of the position demanded dynamic decisions, then in tuition helped them to reach them and to over come the dogmatic confines of their school." Well then, what was the difference between the 'positional' and 'dynamic' players? As Suetin so accurately explains, players of the dy namic modern school turned this intuition into a conscious part of their play, and they increas ingly learned how to create positions in which the dyn;unic element was the dominant one. By contrast, "the adherents of the positional school .. . indeed anticipated the dynamic factors which become operative during the struggle and which are independent of their will. But through their limited theoretical judgements they were not in a position consciously to bring about dynamically stamped positions. Their knowledge of dynamics remained superficial and was unable to influence substantially the direction of style." Hence the sterility of chess that Capablanca complained about; for all his greatness, he had an ultimately limiting dogma tism. In Suetin's terms, he and his contempo raries were not predisposed to consciously introduce dynamic imbalances into their games. It took Alekhine and his descendants to expand the game in this fashion. Reti, too, has pertinent things to say about the dynamism that was just beginning to appear in his time. Speaking of Bogoljubow's style, he sounds remarkably like the modern GM Suba (see below) in describing situations laden with what we now call 'latent dynamism': "In recent years, it has generally been the custom to judge a position from the viewpoint of action, thus contrasting with, or, properly speaking, supplementing Steinitz's static view of the position (weak points, etc.). Seemingly poor, restricted positions may be good ones, if they are capable of development and offer pos sibilities of planning ahead. On the other hand, a fine, unrestricted position, which is seem ingly better, may sometimes actually be bad, if it is not capable of development and no plan can be discovered for making it stronger."
[MOC]
This is precisely the point Suba makes about the Hedgehog formation and other modern po sitions. Reti speaks in the same vein about Alekhine: "The dry methodical process, of which the chess technique then consisted, did not suit him. The positional consideration at that time was static, not dynamic. Then it was that in every position the best move and not the deepest and far-reaching plan was sought for ... The striving not to allow himself to be deceived by the apparent simplicity of a position and by obvious moves led him slowly in a new direc tion, whilst ... Rubinstein and Nimzowitsch, by treading the old well-known paths, tried to ap proach truth in chess." [MIC] Of course, the real 'truth' was that dynamic elements would become as much a part of the game as static positional ones. Eventually, long-term dynamic advantages and sustained initiative were taken quite as seriously as pawn weaknesses or misplaced pieces. Alekhine's early conversion to this point of view is shown, for example, in his imaginative gambit line 1 e4 e6 2 d4 d5 3 lt:Jc3 lt:Jf6 4 i.g5 i.e7 5 e5 lt:Jfd7 6 h4 !? i.xg5 7 hxg5 'ii' xg5 8 lLlh3 'ii' e7 9 lt:Jf4 (D). Black has no weaknesses and a variety of de fensive options. Unlike earlier gambits, the
224 SECRETS OF MODERN CHESS STRATEGY
play here takes on a non-forcing character, and yet White maintains a large lead in develop ment with superior piece play, which makes it difficult for Black to free his game. Whether or not this particular gambit is fully sound, that idea - sustained pressure over the long term - characterizes the typical modern pawn sacri fice, as we saw in Chapter 3. Accumulation or Plunder? Nimzowitsch may have drifted into overly static positional play; but he is on record in My System denigrating Steinitz's 'accumulation of small advantages', assigning it a 'subordinate role' and referring to it as a 'petty storing up in values' . Today, the Romanian GM and radical theoretician Mihai Suba goes much farther, claiming that "the archaic concept of 'improv ing the position' is static and irrelevant"! Since each move of the opponent changes the posi tion, he reasons, it is more relevant to speak of 'dynamic strategy' , which he describes as "an attempt to revise the standard, static, conserva tive opinion on what strategy should be (a col lection of rules about the centre, fixed pawn structure ...) and highlight strategy as a continu ous process dealing with the present, the near future, and the distant future of modern chess positions ... [it] tries to restore respect for oppo nents and for the realistic positions which arise in modern chess, where a 'one doing, another applauding' plan is not available." There's a lot to be said for this point of view. I particularly like the 'one doing, another ap plauding' phrase, because that's so often what we get in our middlegame and instructional books. Also, static considerations can be so easily swamped by dynamic ones in practice. In top-flight chess today, one rarely gets the im pression that the opponents are scratching and clawing to 'accumulate small advantages' ; rather, they seem to be interested in major plun der! A high percentage of games are character ized by an ongoing dynamic tension which threatens to recoil against either player at a mo ment's notice. This is, of course, related to the modern opening. Sustained, unclear, double edged play seems to be the rule rather than the exception with players such as Kasparov, Shirov, Anand, Topalov, Ivanchuk, and Polgar; and even the somewhat more positionally oriented players such as Karpov and Kramnik are continually submerged in, and at home with, that kind of unclear slugfest. The best way to see this is not to take my word for it, but to examine collections of games by the top players. Nor is this merely a characteristic of the super-GMs, as a study of the games from any international tournament will tell you. It seems absurd to try to provide 'examples' of dynamic play, as they are everywhere (and scattered throughout this book as well). Per haps a look at a few of Shirov's efforts will be useful, since, like so many of Kasparov's, they often reflect the depth of opening preparation and its role in creating such dynamic situa tions. But there is another interesting aspect to Shirov's play. It has often been said that Mikhail Tal, like Petrosian, was a World Cham pion without stylistic descendants. The idea was that no one else could get away with his ir rational and often unsound sacrifices. While it is true that players defend better today, and are willing to accept sacrifices at the cost of some discomfort, Shirov (a Latvian, like Tal) has consistently been successful at making outra geous sacrifices for rather dubious but hard-to refute attacks. Here are two examples: w Shirov - Stohl Bundesliga 199314 White seems to have been outplayed in this opening (a typically sharp Sicilian), and one might expect a bail-out with 20 g3 'i'c3+ 2 1 J.d2 'fid4 22 J.g5 'i'c3+ 2 3 J.d2, etc., more or less forcing a draw. But Shirov conceives of a

Shirov finds an in credible solution: 27 'i'xd5!! J.h2+ 28 :Xh2 'i'xd5 29 :b5! This move ultimately keeps the king in the centre.

In his brilliant book Fire on Board (a virtual trea sury of modern dynamic play), he devotes a separate chapter to his adventures on both sides of the Botvinnik Variation of the Semi-Slav De fence. The remarkable but typical thing about these games is that, although they often diverge from preparation only at a late stage (say, move 1 8 or 20), they are consistently full of rich and unforeseeable complications. This is true to such an extent that the players find themselves forced to come up with one terrific move after another just to survive, and end up in time trouble despite the time-saving initial moves. This paradox, that deeply-prepared variations can produce incredibly creative over-the-board contests, manifests itself time and again in contemporary chess. The fact that both sides continue to play some heavily-analysed and tactically-rich opening indicates that there is a strategic and dynamic balance which, with good play, will persist throughout the game. It is this lasting quality of the positional and tactical bal ance which leads to so many exciting and origi nal games. P. Nikolic - Shirov Wijk aan Zee 1993

Dynamic Balance and Planning The comments above on modern openings which lead to long-term dynamically-balanced play also apply to positions which are not par ticularly theoretical. Suetin gives us a revealing example of how positional 'transformations' (trading of advantages for other advantages) sometimes fail to affect an overall assessment despite large swings in structure or material. In the following position, Black has two bishops, with a particularly influential one on g7; White has space, and prospects of occupy ing weakened squares on Black's kingside. Play continued:

Black had to anticipate this move, volun tarily giving up the mega-square f5 in return for tremendous pressure on the open b-file.

Perhaps that even though 'dynamic balance' certainly exists (as the history of the ultra-sharp modern openings described above confirms), the resulting play tends to be delicate in the extreme, such that creative tactics are a far more important factor in actual play than any abstract assessment of 'equal' . Another way to look at this is that if the likes of Kasparov, Kramnik, Shirov, and Anand seldom play a game without numerous mis takes in such positions, we can expect consis tently decisive results to arise, usually in favour of the better player on that particular day. 32 ... i.f6 Now Black is holding again, although there are several interesting options in the rest of the game which the reader might be interested to explore: 33 tt:lh6+ 'it>g7 34 lt:\g4 i.d8 35 tt:lxe5 i.f6 36 lt:\c6 .l:.b6 37 tt:le7 i.e5 38 tt:lf5+ �g6 39 .:tdl i.f6 lfl.lh This idea of dynamic balance brings up a subject which is not strictly in the province of middlegame theory, but rather in that of practi cal play. This is the nature of chess planning. I previously mentioned Dvoretsky's remarks on this subject, and they bear reviewing here. He says, very much in the spirit of Suba, that the popular idea of a profound plan which envelops nearly the whole game is a 'delusion' : "It is nonsensical to map out an overly long plan - the very next move could totally change the sit uation on the board and give it a completely different direction." Dvoretsky points out that in practice, players make only general plans, "noting the area and character of the approach ing action", for example, something like attack on the queenside. Planning in more detail tends to occur mostly in what he calls 'separate stra tegic operations (which as a rule are quite small)' . Finally, he quotes Kotov from Think Like a Grandmaster (a much-maligned book in recent times): "The plan in a chess game is the sum total of one strategic operation after an other, each fulfilling an independent idea which results from the demands of the position." We are far enough along in this book to be able to reflect upon many varied examples of modern play. Having done so, who would not concur with Dvoretsky's insight? How often do we see anything resembling a 'Plan' with a cap ital 'P', in the old-fashioned sense of that word? In fact, the dynamically balanced nature of so much of modern chess negates that idea: today, in games where both sides play on both sides of the board and the initiative swings back and forth, planning is necessarily of a local and time-limited nature. There are exceptions, of course, but this is one of those cases where the exception proves the rule: although they still exist, we have to look hard and long for games in which one strategic factor dominates from beginning to end. Normally, such a game will be very pleasing, since in top-flight chess, the opposition seldom allows the smooth execution of a lengthy strategic plan. If such a plan both escapes notice and succeeds, therefore, it is probably of considerable profundity. Optical Advantages versus Elasticity Well, the adventures seen in the games above are familiar enough to the reader, and the main reason that I can call them 'modern' is that they occur so routinely and pervasively in modern practice. But there are other meanings to dyna mism, as indicated earlier. Suba emphasizes the idea of 'dynamic potential', and in particular, he concurs with Suetin that "The option to choose between a good position that cannot be improved and a bad position that can be sub stantially improved is also modern." He refers
DYNAMISM: THE MODERN DIFFERENCE 229
to this quality of potential improvement, along with the ability to adjust quickly to the oppo nent's plans, as the 'elasticity' of a position. I think that this concept can arise in almost every opening in which Black accepts less space for chances against White's centre, e.g., in certain variations of the Sicilian, the Pirc, and the King's, Queen's, and Nimzo-Indian Defences, as well as, for example, various modern defences with l...g6 and l...b6. Black's goal is to remain elastic and flexible, with many options for his pieces, whereas White at some point can be come paralysed by the need to protect against various dynamic pawn-breaks. Suba brings our attention to an opening in which this concept consistently appears, the Hedgehog Variation of the English Opening. To see what he means, let's look at a couple of examples from his own practice. M. Vuki(: - Suba Vinkovci 1977 1 tLlf3 tLlf6 2 g3 b6 3 .1Lg2 .1Lb7 4 O-O e6 5 c4 c5

Let Suba himself comment: "A frequent pic ture in the Hedgehog. White's position looks ideal.

The continual necessity of monitoring ...b5 and ... d5 on every move is one of White's burdens in Hedgehog (and other English and Sicilian Defence) posi tions. 14 ... :fd8 15 'ii' e3 .i.f8 16 tLld4 The point of this reorganization, again, is to prevent ...b5; and the queen is needed on the rather awkward e3-square (see Black's next move) in order to answer . . . d5 with e5. Thus, we see the active white position paradoxically tied down by the restricted black one!
16. ..:e8 17 :e2 1i'b8 18 :d1 g6
Again, we have a typical Hedgehog position in which White lacks a plan. As so often hap pens, he resorts to moves which are somewhat weakening and probably not justified: 19 �h1 .i.g7 20 g4?! h6 21 'ilg3?! tDc5 (D) 22 .i.a1?! It's interesting to reflect upon how our 'chessic eyes' have changed. By traditional standards, White's pieces are more active, and he has a bind on the centre with no weaknesses, whereas Black has a serious weakness on an open file (d6), a minor one on b6, and no pawns on the fourth rank with which to stake out a claim on the centre. But aside from the fact that White's last few moves have allowed Black to activate his pieces in one stroke (22 'ii' e3 was probably best), we now know that in general, Black's dynamic possibilities prevent White from reorganizing his position to advantage. Suba recounts how, when this game was anno tated, a respected grandmaster assumed that Black's play was unsound, and claimed that he 'deserved' a loss from this position. One needs to understand how dogmatic the old views on space were in order to appreciate the revolution which has taken place since. 22 ...e5! Another typical theme; once ...d5 and ...b5 are stopped, a timely ...e5 allows ...b5 to be played, after all. 23 tDc2 b5! 24 cxb5 tDcxe4! 25 tDxe4 tDxe4 26 'fid3?! Black's point is shown by 26 .i.xe4 :Lxc2 !. The best move is 26 'ii' e3, when 26. .. tLlf6 27 bxa6 .i.xa6 28 :ed2 d5 might follow, with Black better. 26 ... tDc5! 27 'fixd6?? :ed8 0-1 White's 27th was a blunder, but otherwise ... axb5 would have given Black a decisive edge. Needless to say, we have only scratched the surface of a topic so broad as 'dynamism' . But it is perhaps the best descriptive term we have for the widely-acknowledged increase in the sharpness of play which began with Alekhine and continues today. In the next chapter, we dis cuss a concept closely related to dynamism: the role of time in modem chess. 1 1 Time and I nformation In this chapter, we investigate a rather abstract sounding issue: the role of time in chess. I will discuss 'time' in the limited sense of tempi, i.e., the number of moves at one's disposal to, for example, carry out a plan. The interesting and controversial aspect of this subject has to do with the value of a single tempo; this has spe cial relevance to symmetrical positions and re versed openings, as we shall see. Furthermore, the value of tempi ties into the discussion of 'la tent dynamism' in the last chapter. The extent of a position's dynamic potential is dependent upon the time available to realize that potential, as well as to the ability to react to changes in the opponent's position (elasticity). In all these cases, there is a trade-off between the benefits of extra moves and the additional information the opponent gleans from them, which leads us to our first topic. Information Theory and Chess Let's begin with the very first move, and in par ticular, with this question: is White better in chess? At first glance, this is rather silly; after all White maintained a 56%/44% winning per centage for most of the century (this fairly re cently slipped to 55%/45%, to be sure). But it is also true that some of the world's top players have scored brilliantly with Black. Fischer is said to have commented that his big break through in chess came when he became aware of Black's genuine winning chances. Also, whether a player actually feels that White is better to some extent depends upon his attitude. Certainly it's hard to believe that Kasparov en ters systems such the King's Indian, Grtinfeld, and Sicilian Defences as Black thinking: "Of course I'm worse to begin with, so it will take some bad moves by my opponent for me to equalize." More likely, he and other attacking players bypass the question by thinking in terms of the concrete nature of the dynamic im balance on the board, and seeking to seize the initiative whenever possible. It is with this in mind that we come to a dis cussion of time, and of what worth a tempo is in the opening. In his marvellous book Dynamic Chess Strategy, Suba has a chapter entitled 'Black is Winning After All ! ' . He tries to jus tify this outrageous thesis by means of what he calls a 'childish joke', the joke being: Child 1 : 'Say a number" Child 2: ' 16' Child 1: ' 17, I win !' Suba explains: "Chess is a game of complete information, and Black's information is always greater - by one move!". Of course, even Suba himself scores better with White than with Black, but this information-theoretic point of view is actually quite relevant to chess and ex planatory of some of its paradoxes. Classical chess theory has traditionally ignored the nega tive qualities of having the move. The assump tion has always been that specific moves may have drawbacks, not that the general obligation to make a move has drawbacks ! But modern theory acknowledges this fact in several re spects. Later in this chapter, for example, I will discuss why so many reversed openings tend to be uninteresting or even inferior for the side playing with an extra tempo. Essentially, the extra move allows the defender to adjust in ad vance to his opponent's plans. This is Suba's main point; chess is a reactive game, in which all moves are committal and thus in some sense helpful to the opponent. It is interesting in this context to consider just what White would do on his first move if he wanted to 'play Black' with an extra tempo. The fact is that chess moves are not just 'tempi' ; they generally con tain disadvantages as well. This is obvious with moves like 1 a4 or 1 h4, which are explicitly weakening; but even a modest move such as 1 a3, which proves useful in so many black open ings, is also committal, in that queenside cas tling will be less attractive, and if White ever moves his c-pawn, there can be slight weak nesses on queenside light squares like b3. It's also not too difficult for Black, with his lead in
232 SECRETS OF MODERN CHESS STRATEGY
information, to find openings in which the move a3 is either useless or out-of-place. The reply l...g6 makes a good start in that direction. In many openings, Black indeed benefits from knowing his opponent's plans. For exam ple, Suba points out that in the classical varia tion of the Scheveningen Sicilian (1 e4 c5 2 lbf3 d6 3 d4 cxd4 4 lL'Ixd4 lL'If6 5 lL'Ic3 e6, or 5 . . .a6 followed by 6 ... e6), Black tends to wait until White's light-squared bishop moves be fore he decides upon the best position for his b8-knight. If that bishop goes to g2 or f3 (via e2), he says, then c6 tends to be the best square; but if the bishop is developed on d3 or c4, then ... lL'Id7 tends to be more appropriate. One can come up with similar mini-rules in many unbal anced openings and even in symmetrical ones (see below). Of course, one can also carry things too far. Not all information is useful; for example, it doesn't help you to know that you are facing unavoidable mate; and even knowledge that your opponent is trying to force weaknesses in your position may not be enough to prevent him from succeeding. I would propose another chil dren's game as a better metaphor for certain po sitions in chess: the race to the telephone pole. Child 1 gets a head start; Child 2 is intellectu ally precocious, but unfortunately, no faster than his friend. Then the conversation goes: Child 1 : 'OK, I'm off! ' [runs towards the pole] Child 2 [does the same, after a delay] : 'Me too, and I know where you're going!' Child 1 [reaching pole first]: 'Big deal. I win !' Child 2: 'Yes, but I know more about the route you've taken than you know about mine ! ' Child I : 'Who cares? I won! ' [and walks away muttering: "You're weird."] This is fundamentally the problem with the extreme version of Suba's argument (the 'Black is better' part). Some chess positions are more linear, in that an extra tempo merely brings one closer to the finish line; whereas others are characterized by interdependent infighting, such that the knowledge of the opponent's last move is indeed almost worth the tempo he has gained from it. Taking this into account, we might sug gest (as Suba does) that Black play unbalanced structures with great potential for reaction. Indeed, as we have noted elsewhere (Chapter 3, in the section about backward pawns), Suba' s favourite Sicilian Defence ...d6/ ... e6 structure scores better for Black than other defences to 1 e4, perhaps suggesting that Black's 'lead' in in formation really is of some use in the appropri ate positions. This is the kind of issue that bears watching as chess evolves. Remis? While we're more or less on the subject, what is the proper result of a perfectly played chess game? As you probably already know, it is a draw. There is no need to wait for computers to solve chess in order to understand this; it is crystal clear from a study of theory. Of course, I can't prove this, but I doubt that you can find a single strong player who would disagree. For those who like authoritative sources, I remem ber Kasparov, after a last-round draw, explain ing to the waiting reporters: 'Well, chess is a draw.' If one of the most dynamic players in his tory (with the highest winning percentage of his time) believes this, we can probably assume that it's true. And yet, how many sources sim ply neglect to address this subject! One feels that they don't want to present chess as a boring game which is only made competitive by hu man error. But for one thing, even 'perfect' play can result in games which, however well-played, are characterized by wild shifts in momentum; see the next chapter for a discussion of the swings of initiative which mark dynamically balanced chess games. Moreover, any number of positions assessed as 'equal' in books are so unbalanced and complex as to make that assess ment only a guide to one's practical chances. Tal once remarked that most of the '=' assess ments in opening books were actually ''f' ! As an author of opening books, I know what he means. Because of the presumption of White being better, the juncture of the game at which Black frees his game or neutralizes White's plans has often automatically been assumed to give him equality, even though in dynamic openings, the exhaustion of White's initiative very often means that Black has seized it with advantage. This brings up the notion of 'arithmeticism' in chess. Especially with the appearance of
TIME AND INFORMATION 233
chess-playing computers which update a nu merical assessment of the position on every half-move, there are players who tend to think in terms of arithmetic advantages, e.g., 'White is better by 0.33 pawns' . This has its uses, but can lead to a rather artificial view of the game. What happens when both sides make a few moves which are the best ones, and suddenly the 0.33 pawns is down to 0.00, or full equality? The defender of this point of view will say: 'Well, I didn't see far enough ahead. If I had, I would have accurately assessed the original position as 0.00.' The only problem with this point of view is that chess is a draw, and all kinds of clear advantages (in the sense of hav ing a good probability of winning a position in a practical game) are insufficient to force a win against perfect defence. So most positions would be assessed as 0.00, which is not very helpful. In the extreme, we have the same prob lem when we claim, for example, that 1 lDf3 is 'better' than 1 e4, or 1 d4 is better than 1 c4. These are rather meaningless statements, unless we put them in the context of 'better against op ponent X' or 'better from the standpoint of achieving good results with the least study' or some such. As for the objective claim of superi ority, what would be our criterion? I would sug gest that only if a given first move consistently performs better than others against all levels of competition might we designate it as 'better' in a practical sense. Since all reasonable first moves lead to a draw with perfect play, a claim of ultimate theoretical superiority for one of them cannot be justified. Time and Reversed Openings The relative effectiveness of various reversed openings is a complex subject. Students are of ten irritated, for example, that everyone has such difficulties playing as White against a Si cilian Defence (1 e4 c5), but that leading mas ters have no qualms about answering 1 c4 with l...e5. Similarly, the Dutch Defence looks par ticularly sterile when White achieves the re versed positions a tempo up (it turns out that he has nothing useful to do !); and indeed, many standard black openings are not very inspiring when one gets them as White, tempo in hand. This is where Suba's information-theoretic viewpoint really comes into its own. We have already mentioned two reasons for White's dis appointment: a) most moves have disadvantages as well as advantages, so an extra move is not always an unqualified blessing; b) with his extra information about what White is doing, Black can better react to the new situation. A third reason is simple, but also important: because he feels the obligation of playing for a win, White will often not be satisfied with a move which clearly equalizes, but allows a type of drawish simplification. Black in the same position may feel no compunction about enter ing into that simplification, since a draw with Black is considered an acceptable result. Let's begin with some simple examples. The Modern Benoni, 1 d4 lDf6 2 c4 c5 3 d5 e6 4 ltJc3 exd5 5 cxd5 d6 6 e4 g6, is a dynamic and dangerous weapon for Black. Wouldn't White like to get the same kind of chances a full tempo up? But after 1 lDf3 d5 2 c4 d4, Black already knows what White is up to. He won't therefore oblige White after 3 e3 with 3 ...c5, but rather play simply 3 ... ltJc6, which has long been con sidered equal. Similarly, 3 g3 can be answered by 3 ... ltJc6 4 �g2 e5. Another reversed Benoni situation arises after 1 liJf3 d5 2 c4 e6 3 b3 c5 4 g3 lDc6 5 �g2 lDf6 6 O-O �e7 7 �b2 O-O 8 d3 d4 9 e3 (9 e4 is more promising, but that's an other story) 9 ...e5 10 exd4, and now 10. .. exd4 is fine, but the surprising thing is that Black can also play 10 ... cxd4!? (D). Black is two full tempi behind the white side of the main-line Benoni which goes 1 d4 lDf6 2
234 SECRETS OF MODERN CHESS STRATEGY
c4 c5 3 d5 e6 4 lDc3 exd5 5 cxd5 d6 6 e4 g6 7 ll'lf3 i.g7 8 i.e2 O-O 9 O-O: one tempo for being Black, and another for playing ... e6-e5 instead of ...e5 in one move. And yet his position is fine! Why? Because White's bishop on b2, de veloped, is worse than it would be on cl, unde veloped ! On b2, it gets in the way of .:tb 1 and b4 (Black's main plan in the reversed position is ... .:tb8 and ...b5), it is not able to go to g5 (again, in the reversed position, the most effec tive deployment for the c8-bishop is on g4), and it doesn't even support an f4 advance, which sometimes arises in the reversed position. In fact, White may even want to play 1 1 i.e1 in the diagrammed position ! One could say that Black's extra information - that the bishop was already committed to b2 - allowed him to play ...d4 with confidence. Sometimes, defences are simply too associ ated with equalizing ideas to be useful with colours reversed. Thus, for example, the Pirc Defence Reversed after 1 g3 e5 2 i.g2 d5 3 d3 lDf6 4 lDf3 lDc6 has never been considered a good weapon for White, although of course he is not worse, since the equalizing e4 will be easy to play. Other defences are generally thought of as dynamic, but tum out to be surprisingly reac tive in nature. A typical example is the Tarrasch Defence to the Queen's Gambit Declined. This dynamic black weapon when played by Spassky or Kasparov seems a bit mushy when played by White a tempo up, e.g., l lDf3 c5 2 c4 g6 3 lDc3 i.g7 4 e3 lDf6 5 d4 cxd4 6 exd4 d5 7 i.e2 O-O 8 O-O lDc6 (D) .

w Although White has moderately useful moves such as 9 .:tel or 9 h3 at his disposal, this position is already fully equal for Black. With the same opening moves, similarly, the reversed English Opening position with 6 lDxd4 O-O 7 i.e2 d5 promises nothing for the first player. And White has many opportunities to get Griinfeld positions a tempo up, but theory indi cates that there is little he can do with them (note that this does not include the Exchange Griinfeld, which would indeed be very nice to have with an extra tempo!). Let's examine the relationship of time to in formation by taking an in-depth look at that 1 c4 e5 case. White's goal is to play a Sicilian De fence with a tempo more. Suppose that he starts with 2 g3, aiming for, say, a Dragon or Acceler ated Fianchetto reversed. As it happens, Black can simply go along with this and play 2 ... lDf6 3 i.g2 d5 4 cxd5 lDxd5 5 lDc3 lDb6 6 lDf3 lDc6 with a Classical Dragon reversed; top GMs de fend this position all the time. But Black can also use his extra information - that White is committed to g3 - and play 2 ...c6 (D). w Now 3 i.g2 d5 grabs the centre, e.g., 4 cxd5 cxd5 5 lDf3 lDc6 6 d3 lDf6 with equality. White can instead play in the same way that Black does versus 1 e4 c5 2 c3, i.e., (from the diagram) 3 lDf3 e4 4 lDd4 - what then? The answer is that after 4 ... d5 5 cxd5 'ii' xd5!, Black takes advan tage of the extra g3 move: 6 lDc2 (6 e3 shows the drawback having an extra move, as g3 cre ates light-square weaknesses; play might go 6 ... lDf6 7 lDc3 'ii' e5 8 i.g2 lDa6!? 9 d3 i.g4 or 9 ... lDc5, with easy equality) 6 ... lDf6 7 lDc3 'i'h5. This is known to be fine for Black, e.g., 8 h3 (8 i.g2 i.h3 !) 8 ... 'ii' g6 9 i.g2 i.d6 10 lDe3 O-O 1 1 'ii' c2 .:te8 Shamkovich-Baumbach, USSR

1970. Nor is 2 g3 the greatest of moves in the
line 2 ...c6 3 d4 exd4 4 'ii' xd4 d5 5 .1g2 lZJf6, when theory shows Black achieving equality (although this is certainly interesting enough for both sides). What other second moves might White try? How about trying a Nimzowitsch Sicilian ( 1 e4 c5 2 lZJf3 lZJf6) reversed, by 1 c4 e5 2 lZJf3 (D)?
B
As so often, the lack of a move for Black can actually be to his advantage. For example, in the normal, unreversed, position, the main line goes 3 e5 tL!dS 4 lL!c3 e6 5 lL!xd5 exd5 with dy namic play. But in the reversed position, Black has (from the diagram) 2 ...e4 3 lLld4 lL!c6 4 e3 lL!xd4 5 exd4 'ii' f6! (the reward for not having ... lL!f6 in!), e.g., 6 d5 .1c5 7 'ii' e2 'ii' g6 8 lZJc3 lLlf6 9 d3 O-O 10 dxe4 lL!g4 1 1 lL!d1 d6 12 f3 lL!e5 intending ...f5, Murey-Udov, Moscow
1966. Black has very promising play for a pawn.
What about a nice innocuous move like 1 c4 e5 2 d3 instead? Dragon and Najdorf players may perk up their ears here, but they will be dis appointed if Black plays 2 ...c6 with the idea ... d5, for example, 3 lL!f3 d6 4 lL!c3 f5 (note again the advantage of not having ... lL!f6 in). This is a typical structure in which White would probably rather have his pawns on e3 and d4 and his king's knight on e2. Now, however, d4 can only come in two steps, negating White's advantage. It turns out that 2 d3 is rather com mittal after all. Well, then, what about 1 c4 e5 2 lL!c3 lLlf6 3 g3 as another try? Again, a simple response is Keres's 3 ...c6, when the main line runs 4 lZJf3 (else 4 ... d5) 4 ... e4 5 lL!d4 d5 6 cxd5 'ii' b6 ! 7 lL!b3 cxd5 8 ..Bg2 ..Bf5 9 d3 ..Bb4, and as far as I know, this position is still considered dynami cally equal. Again, White has not succeeded in simply reversing a normal Sicilian. Probably even more convincing for Black is a Rossolimo Sicilian Reversed, i.e., 1 c4 e5 2 lL!c3 lLlf6 3 g3 ..Bb4 4 ..Bg2 O-O (D). w An amusing position! In the reversed (Sicil ian) case, it would be 'Black's' move here. So let's give Black an extra tempo in our imagina tion. Then the normal plans for him would be: a) ...c6, when White could respond with lL!f3 !; b) ... lL!c6, which among other things allows lZJdS ! ; c) . . .d6, which has several answers, includ ing lLlf3; and d) ... l::r. e8, which is often answered by e4. But it's actually White's move, and it's too early for him to expect an advantage from moves which are mainly responsive in nature. In the diagram, for example, if White plays 5 d3, he runs into the surprisingly dangerous 5 ...c6 !, threatening 6 ...d5, e.g., 6 ..Bd2? ! d5 7 'ii' b3 lL!a6! 8 cxd5 cxd5 9 lL!xdS ..Bxd2+ and lO ... tLlcS with obvious compensation; or 6 'ii' b3 lL!a6! 7 lZJf3 (7 e4? lZJc5 !) 7 ... e4 8 lZJd4 exd3 9 exd3 lZJc5 ! 10 'ii' c2 d5, etc. (analysis by Kapengut). And a move like 5 lZJd5 is truly harmless when 5 ... lZJxd5 6 cxd5 doesn't even attack a knight on c6. If White plays an immediate 5 e4, Black has the dynamic riposte 5 ... ..Bxc3 ! 6 bxc3 (6 dxc3 d6 is known to be equal; that is fine for Black, but for White?) 6 ...c6! 7 lLle2 d5 8 cxd5 cxd5 9 exd5 lL!xd5 10 O-O lZJc6 and White's centre and light squares are weak. We looked at this last position in Chapter 7 (in the section 'Reversing
236 SECRETS OF MODERN CHESS STRATEGY
the Conventional Wisdom'). This leaves 5 4Jf3, "''hen Black can transpose to a known main line after 5 ... 4Jc6, still avoiding a reversed Sicilian, or he can try the more flexible 5 ... l::t. e8 6 O-O c6!?. The point is, Black's set-up in the Sicilian is fine as a reactive system, but not worth much when trying to claim the initiative as White. This is true because Black is able to react to the specific plan White chooses; in Suba's terms, his information is indeed a move greater! Fur thermore, he is able to take advantage of dead equal positions which White (hoping to retain the advantage of the first move) would nor mally avoid. Before leaving this subject, let me just point to (without actually analysing) a last example after the same I c4 e5: 2 lt:Jc3 lt:Jc6 3 g3 g6 4 .i.g2 .i.g7. The reader will recognize this as a Closed Sicilian Reversed. But whereas the Closed Sicilian is not very popular for White, and is considered easy for Black to de fend against, the Closed Sicilian Reversed is a vital and popular system for Black, despite him being a tempo down! Why? Well, to some ex tent, he can breathe easily because of his oppo nent's obligation to move! Moves like 5 l:tb1 , 5 e4, 5 e3 and 5 4Jf3 commit White to a certain development and make it relatively easy for Black to respond accordingly. White can defer a decision by 5 d3, but after 5 ...d6, he must tip his hand anyway, e.g., by 6 e4, 6 l::t. b1, 6 e3 or 6 4Jf3. Even the seemingly non-committal 6 .i.d2 forfeits the chance for .i.b2 and weakens sup port for a later d4. This is not an openings man ual, but the patient student can learn a lot about how reversed openings work by using standard references and comparing each of these 5th and 6th moves with the analogous Closed Sicilian variations. Today's Symmetry is Tomorrow's Opportunity The subject of symmetrical openings is a huge one, but I just want to make some simple points about time and information. As so often, Nimzo witsch had advanced insight into this issue. In Chess Praxis, under the heading "Asymmetric Treatment of Symmetrical Positions", he intro duces the subject historically: "Followers of the so-called classic school had a marked prefer ence, which is today difficult to understand, for symmetrical variations. Not only that, but they managed to surround this unpleasing circum stance with a scientific cloak. The belief gained ground that many positions and openings had a natural tendency towards symmetry, and that it would be sacrificing the intellect to wish to avoid this heaven-sent gift..." Nimzowitsch then examines the French De fence Exchange Variation after 1 e4 e6 2 d4 d5 3 exd5 exd5 (D). w He claims that if White puts his king's knight on f3, that Black should put his king's knight on e7, and vice-versa (4Je2 is met by ... 4Jf6). In fact, Nimzowitsch won several games in which he followed the first policy (answering 4Jf3 with ... lt:Je7). He was truly ahead of his time in this regard. Modern players of the French De fence have little difficulty unbalancing the po sition in this variation. Just for example, Black can react to 4 lt:Jc3 with 4 ... .i.b4 or 4 ... c6, he can answer 4 .i.d3 with 4 ... 4Jc6 or 4 ...c5, and he can respond to 4 4Jf3 with 4 ... .i.g4 or 4 ... .i.d6. In the latter case (after 4 4Jf3 .i.d6), 5 .i.d3 t:De7 (or 5 ... .i.g4), 5 c4 c6 6 t:Dc3 t:De7, and 5 t:Dc3 c6 are all asymmetrical positions with sufficient tension to ensure a full-fledged struggle. Here again we see a case where the 'Black has more information' thesis applies unambig uously; in each of the above examples, Black responds to White's committal move with an answer designed to frustrate its intent. In mod ern chess, this early attempt to unbalance is characteristic of the commonly-played sym metrical positions. In the Slav Defence, after 1
TIME AND INFORMATION 237
d4 d5 2 c4 c6 3 cxd5 cxd5 4 li:Jf3 li:Jf6 5 lt:Jc3 lt:Jc6 6 i.f4, for example, 6 ...a6 is a popular move. Another case in point is seen in the Semi-Tarrasch Defence, after 1 d4 d5 2 c4 e6 3 tbf3 tbf6 4 l0c3 c5 5 e3 tbc6 (D) (or a number of other move-orders). w As Nimzowitsch himself complained, innu merable games before him went 6 i.d3 i.d6 at this point; his own suggestion was at least to play 6 ... i.e7, in order to maintain Black's pres sure along the d-file. But modern play takes carefully into consideration the committal na ture of making a move. 6 i.d3 is not at all popu lar today, for the simple reason that the bishop has to move twice to capture on c4, e.g., after 6 ... cxd4 7 exd4 dxc4 8 i.xc4 i.e?, and Black has achieved an asymmetrical isolated queen's pawn position similar to the Queen's Gambit Accepted, but a full tempo up (due to i.fl d3xc4, which occurs in one move in the QGA). What does White therefore do in the dia gram? Normally, one of two things. He can play 6 cxd5 himself, but this leaves Black the choice of two sound moves: 6 ... exd5 and 6 ... tbxd5; in the latter case, White is once again likely to end up with an isolated queen' s pawn after ...cxd4/exd4. That results in a complex and in teresting game, pitting White's active piece play versus Black's blockade of the potentially weak (in the long term) d4-pawn. White's other move is perhaps more typical still: he wants to make the most useful move which nevertheless doesn't lose time (like 6 i.d3) or give his oppo nent too much 'information' (like 6 cxd5). Such a move, also known as 'a useful waiting move' , is 6 a3. Then if Black plays 6 ...i.d6, White can not only gain time by 7 dxc5, but af ter 7 ... i.xc5, 8 b4 may be a useful way of pre paring quick development by i.b2. Or if Black plays (6 a3) 6 ... cxd4 7 exd4 dxc4 !? 8 i.xc4, the move a3 is known to be quite useful in such po sitions (it provides a convenient retreat for the bishop on a2 and prepares 'i!Vd3 without allow- ing the reply ... lbb4, among other things). For this reason, 6 ...cxd4 7 exd4 i.e? makes more sense. But Black can also answer 6 a3 with the unbalancing 6 ... lt:Je4, or he can continue the symmetry for one more move by 6 ... a6, and only unbalance things on the next move. The lesson here, and in other symmetrical openings, is that at many junctures, Black can choose to utilize the information given him by White's extra move to create an unbalanced and by no means inferior position. He tends to do this at an early stage. Seldom does one see the prolonged copycatting that Nimzowitsch be moaned in his day. In conclusion, modern dynamism with the black pieces stems in part from Black's ability to use his greater information. To the extent that Black can play asymmetric openings with a lot of tension, the advantage of the first move may be at least partially compensated for. 1 2 The I nitiative Dance : Some M usings Chess would be an easy game if there were a set of guidelines which one could absorb to master the game. Since that isn't the case, players ev erywhere wonder about what separates the club player from the master, the master from the grandmaster, and even the 'average grandmas ter' from the world champion. I have neither the knowledge nor inclination to answer such ques tions in any detail, but I would like to speculate briefly in order to introduce this chapter's topic. My own feeling is that the most important fac tor which differentiates experienced players from each other is their ability to calculate well, which includes the ability to visualize and assess positions accurately. That, in turn, is closely connected with advanced pattern-recognition skills and a good memory. The player who can see further into the position and accurately as sess what's happening, whether tactically or positionally, tends to be the better player. There are, to be sure, other important determinants such as ability to concentrate fully for extended periods of time, fighting spirit, work ethic, and the like. But having the ability to visualize posi tions accurately (a major part of calculation), and being able to draw on an enormous bank of patterns and positions in a clear and useful way tend to be the most important determinants of what we call chess talent. From what has been written about this subject (and from the experi ence of prodigies, for example), I think a case can be made that those skills are to a large ex tent innate; or at least they must be learned at a very early age. Nevertheless, there are types of chess thought not fully tied in with calculation and vi sualization which also play an important role. Players and writers are notoriously vague about abilities in this realm, using words such as 'in tuition', 'creativity', and 'imagination' , for ex ample. In practical terms, the most common and important test of such qualities arises when players must calculate to a certain depth in a position and then simply make an intuitive judgement about whether the resulting situa tion will be favourable or not. A strong player, for example, may be skilled at estimating with high probability whether a position will be good for him, whereas a grandmaster may also have the ability to see unusual tactical shots at the end of a calculation, in just that one branch of analysis which he 'happens' to extend a bit further than the others. In their notes to games, good players talk a lot about just 'feeling' whether a possible attacking variation would win out in the end or not. It seems to me that the ability to make such judgements depends upon recognizing critical moments of a game, and even more importantly, understanding the swings of momentum which occur in any given contest. I'd like to look at some interpretations of those swings here. The Mysteries of Momentum: What is an Advantage? Modern chess writers have made the point that there are various kinds of initiative. The one which appeals best to our 'arithmetical' under standing is when one side is attacking, and in a step-by-step fashion, that initiative is finally converted into a combination. Suetin calls this kind of initiative 'gradually ripening'. But Romanovsky makes the point that "the initia tive will quite often bear a temporary character: it either runs dry or is intercepted by the oppos ing side." Now by the initiative 'running dry', we can presume he means that one side's activ ity and threats cease without the other's taking over. But how typical is this situation? It seems to me that the reality is more like Tal's com ments in the last chapter about Black equaliz ing, i.e., that when Black 'equalizes' , he is usually better. Or as Reti says about the attack: "once [it] is repulsed, the counterattack is
THE /NITIATNE DANCE: SOME MUSINGS 239
usually decisive". Similarly, I feel, the loss of initiative by one side is very often accompanied by its adoption by the other side. So it's fair to say, as a starting point, that shifts in momentum (or the lack of them) don't seem to follow any set pattern. Here's how I would describe the three 'model' situations: In an exceptional game, one side has an initiative, develops it over the course of 15-25 moves, and finally coverts it into a winning attack or end game. Kasparov seems particularly brilliant at finding positions in which the initiative never peters out, and I remember that the German GM Uhlmann at his peak was also quite adept at this - it was as though the opponent never had a chance to squirm out. Then there are some games in which one side has the initiative, the other side neutralizes it, and the game is quickly drawn. But in a typically complex mod ern struggle between two equally matched op ponents, it seems to me that the struggle is often characterized by a handing back and forth of initiative, mutual threats, and unclear tension. Suba makes some excellent observations about this issue. He begins by discussing the overall idea of 'the advantage' : "The advantage in chess does not seem to obey the rules of simple logic. Two good moves do not necessarily make a good pair. An attack ing move which forces a retreating move in re ply does not always give any advantage, or increase an existing one. Sometimes such 'ply' may even do damage to a favourable balance of the initiative or some other sort of advantage ... There is a sort of coil-spring defensive potential which must be considered a factor. It is a form of dynamic potential [Suba's term which we discussed in Chapter 10 - JW] and shows that, paradoxically, the latter can sometimes be im proved by a retreating move". Note how this is consistent with our discussion of tempi and 'in formation' in the last chapter. Applying this model to the concept of the initiative, Suba provides us the following con versation between the Fan ('F' ) and the Master
('M'):
"F: Do you think that initiative is a part of dynamism as well? M: No, I think that initiative is just an exte rior aspect of dynamism. It is a continuous con sumption and regeneration of dynamism, and a change in the balance of these two elements may jeopardize potential. F: Is that why sometimes you lose the initia tive without any logical explanation? M: Yes. Sometimes you must lose it, just like that. If you try to cling to it, by forcing the issue, your dynamic potential will become exhausted and you won't be able to face a vigorous coun terattack." Now, if the last two chapters dealt with rela tively unproveable abstractions, this kind of talk seems to be approaching mysticism, or at least, some chess equivalent of Continental Meta physics! But I think the open-minded reader will admit that, however unscientific and even exotic these comments are, they also ring true as a description of our personal chess experi ence. Haven't we all felt this 'coil-spring defen sive potential' in a position, and doesn't the Master's explanation oflosing the initiative and trying to cling to it too long correspond to many of our own games? What's more, don't these ideas apply to many of the games of even the best players of our day? I think that we resist such concepts because: a) they aren't all that useful in improving our own play: after all, it's easier to examine a potential course of action carefully and then make our best possible assessment about it than it is to try to figure out which kind of initiative we've been handed, or how 'coily' our oppo nent's defensive springs are! b) that familiar arithmetical model has a powerful influence on us: if I'm 'better' for a certain number of moves, by a certain 'amount' (say, a half of a pawn), then it's absurd that sud denly I'm faced with a situation in which I can't even equalize ! Of course, this means that I've made a mistake somewhere; but the seeming ir rationality of the situation arises when after a series of perfectly logical and harmless moves, we can't even cash in our half pawn for equal ity, but rather have to watch in horror as the op ponent's counter-initiative unfolds and threatens to sweep us off the board entirely ! And then, graciously, we find that after another 5 or 6 of our own semi-desperate defensive moves, our opponent runs out of ideas, and suddenly (also without having seemingly done anything wrong) stands worse again! Of course, to an ultra-logical critic, this may
240 SECRETS OF MODERN CHESS STRATEGY
just sound like the ravings of a weak player. That critic might object: "Look, it all just seems irrational to you because you aren't strong enough to see into the position clearly, or you simply can't calculate far enough." But that ob jection is a bit specious; using the same reason ing, why should we ever attempt to talk about chess in theoretical terms at all? It is never pos sible to assess arithmetically all of the elements of a complex position and take into account all future possibilities; even if a computer were ul timately able to do the equivalent of this, it would do so by essentially performing a brute force search on all future moves, not by adding up theoretical advantages and disadvantages. To me, the proof that Suba's model reflects something very real about chess (putting aside the question of its usefulness) is that we have here a description of not just the typical 1800 player' s adventures in the local club champion ship, but also of the fantastic and convoluted battles which the world's top ten players fairly regularly engage in! In particular, if you recall our several discussions of the complex and dy namically-balanced modern openings which characterize top-flight chess, you will recall the remarkable length of time during which the ad vantage and initiative seems to swing back and forth. This not only happens in some theoretical sense, but in the minds of our best players, who make this dynamic give-and-take explicit in the notes to their own games, and in post-mortems. Dynamism and Provocation The above comments are meant to give a pic ture of the paradoxical nature of momentum and initiative. In modern openings, both White and Black try to find positions in which they cede to their opponents apparent advantages (often the attack or initiative), knowing that such advantages can be neutralized, in return for positional gains or counterattack. The re sulting positions tend to be unfavourable to the side with the failed attack, because the other player either gains long-term positional advan tages or himself assumes the initiative. This might be called a strategy of long-term provo cation, in that the opponent is invited to take ap parently promising, but ultimately committal, steps. In the most general sense, this describes the essence of numerous dynamic modern defences for Black. In many of the main lines of major defences like the various Sicilians, the French, the Modern Benoni, and the Griinfeld, for ex ample, White can get both the initiative (nor mally via spatial preponderance and/or a lead in development) and attacking chances, whereas Black often holds long-term positional and counter-attacking trumps. The trick is to find variations in which the initiative or attack pe ters out and passes back to Black. We have al ready seen such ideas in the Poisoned Pawn Variation of the Najdorf Sicilian, for example, and in our discussion of 'mega-centre' open ings such as the Four Pawns Attack versus the Benoni or the radical pawn-storms against the Griinfeld Exchange Variation. But even calmer main-line Open Sicilians and Griinfelds have the irritating tendency to leave Black with a nice queenside attack and open c-file in an end ing, so White generally has to transform the pawn structure before that arises. Similarly, Modern Benoni endings are often characterized by a position where Black's queenside pawns come rushing down the board by ... b5, ...c4, and b4, for example; so in games with that opening as well, White has a tendency either to attack or to transform the pawn structure during the middlegame. In such cases, if White attacks by rushing his pawns forward to open lines against the king, the failure of that attack will more of ten than not lead to an effective counter initiative by Black, as the reader has probably experienced. This sort of dynamic resiliency in openings like the Sicilian is pretty well-known, but what about from the white side? It seems to me that a lot of modern openings feature something simi lar by White. He plays for positional gains (in some case, merely 'the accumulation of small advantages' !), but in doing so, provokes Black to counter actively by attacking or, at least, seizing an initiative. White's hope is that when that attack fails or the initiative peters out, he will be left with either a permanent positional advantage or an attack of his own. As an exam ple, recall how, in our overview of the 4 'iWc2 Nimzo-Indian in Chapter 7 (subsection 'c'), we saw lines where Black (with the knight-pair) went all-out in attack, whereas White possessed
THE INITIATNE DANCE: SOME MUSINGS 241
the long-term advantage of the two bishops. White's provocative philosophy (confirmed by experience) was that if the attack failed, his counterattack and positional advantages would be decisive. Certainly many 1 c4 e5 variations of the English Opening are based on provoking an ultimately ineffective Black kingside attack ( ...f5/ ... g5), and the same thing might be said of the white side of the main lines of the Dutch Defence. To conclude this chapter, let me point out a few games in other openings featuring this dy namic. Kasparov - P. Nikolic Linares 1997
1 e4 e5 2 li:Jf3 ll:Jc6 3 d4 exd4 4 li:Jxd4 li:Jf6 5
ll:Jxc6 bxc6 6 e5 'ike7 7 'ii' e2 lbd5 8 c4 .ta6 9 b3 gS!? Black has a lead in development, and plays actively. One factor to be aware of, however, is that if he doesn't succeed in either attacking White or transforming the pawn structure, his three pawn islands and doubled pawns may leave him with a very poor ending. In the fol lowing case, when Black's activity fizzled, White's positional advantages were decisive: 9 ...g6 10 g3 .tg7 and now Kasparov-I.Sokolov, Erevan Olympiad 1996 (by transposition) con tinued: 1 1 .tb2 O-O 12 .tg2 l:,tfe8 1 3 O-O li:Jb6 14 :tel d5 15 iVc2 ! .l:t.ad8 16 liJd2 iVc5 17 l:tac l d4?

This game illustrates the delicate balance between provocation and handing one's opponent a dev astating attack. Because of this, the 'provoca tion strategy' is not to be entered into lightly; but you will find that provocation is in any case inherent in a number of modern counterattack ing openings.

There's hardly a more common example of a 'provocative' white opening than the main lines of the King's Indian Defence. In most variations, including the one we are following, White turns his attention to opening files and establishing key squares on the queenside, which in the long run tends to be decisive. In doing so, he leaves himself open to a kingside attack by Black, be ginning with the move ...f5 and often followed by ...f4, ...g5-g4, and the attempted massacre of White's king. As with the provocative openings employed by Black above (the Sicilian De fence, for example), if the attacker's strategy falters, he is usually in big trouble positionally, and he tends to lose most endings. Of course, what can happen to Black in the Sicilian can also happen to White in the King's Indian, i.e., the provocation is sometimes too severe, lead ing to an overwhelming attack by the side that has been provoked to do so!

OK, so now Black has his standard attack. But as the game in the last note shows, that at tack tends to run into a brick wall, leaving White his queenside advantage. In this game, Black falls victim to a rather easy tactic.

To those interested in this topic, I would recommend examining contemporary games with these concepts in mind, and see if you feel that such ideas are helpful. I have included this discussion in my book mainly because I feel that this is the sort of area which will become increasingly important. Players who can get a feel for the paradoxical comings and goings of momentum and initiative, for example, will be well-armed for the type of chess contemporary masters engage in. And the correct use of prov ocation is a skill which separates the finest players from the rest of us. 1 3 The Modern Openi ng Reconsidered I n discussing advances in modem chess, I have tried throughout to mix complete games and middlegame positions with opening ideas. The latter have the benefit of being well-tested and familiar to the reader. Of course, as I have pointed out elsewhere, the distinction between the modern opening and middlegame has be come increasingly blurred. Opening analysis can extend into the endgame, and routinely goes well beyond the older conception of the opening as the part of the game in which you 'get the pieces out'. I think that it's safe to say that the bulk ot middlegame analysis done by modern players concerns itself with positions that are 'theoretical', in the sense that they ei ther have arisen (or will arise) repeatedly in practice. In contrast, we used to study a famous position from, say, one of Pillsbury or Rubin stein's games, knowing full well that it would never occur again. Similarly, changes in the theory of positional and strategic play are often opening-theory-based, as will be clear to those who have made it through the book thus far. In view of all this, it would serve us well to take a final look at contemporary openings. Let's be gin with some historical reflections. The Paradox of Alekhine Chess-players invest a lot of time and effort in mastering their craft, and like academics and scientists everywhere, they are naturally resis tant to new ideas. In Chapter 2, we already cited a number of examples of narrow-minded dog matism about opening ideas by great players such as Steinitz, Tarrasch, Reti, Nimzowitsch, Alekhine and Fine. Traditionally, experimenta tion with new concepts has been a double edged sword, e.g., Steinitz arguably sacrificed more points than he gained by pushing his de fensive/positional style to its limits. But in the realm of openings, new ideas tend to be more of an advantage than not, if only because the player employing them presumably knows more about the resulting positions than his op ponent. Thus, no one would argue that Botvin nik, Fischer, and Kasparov, to take the three most extreme examples for their respective times, did not benefit immensely from their large supply of theoretical innovations. Argu ably, in each of these three cases, their oppo nents underestimated the value of ever-deeper opening preparation, which allowed Fischer and Kasparov a shocking number of quick vic tories against sophisticated opposition. Today, of course, it is almost routine for top players like Kramnik and Anand to win games based upon their superior preparation, and a similar phenomenon takes place all the way down the ranks to master play at open tournaments. Let's take a step back and see how this situa tion developed. Alekhine makes an interesting study as the transitional figure between the classical view and the modem analytical one. On the one hand, he had a classical addiction to occupying the centre with pawns and, as we have previously noted, rejected both the King's Indian Defence and the Modern Defence ( l...g6). His notes in the New York 1924 and New York 1927 tournament books, while of the highest standards for his time, are full of mis guided and dogmatically-phrased opinions about various openings. In Chapter 4 of this Part (the section on the relationship of flank to centre), for example, I already mentioned his exaggerated attack on the move 6 h4 in the Caro-Kann main line following 1 e4 c6 2 d4 d5 3 tLlc3 dxe4 4 tLlxe4 i.f5 5 tLlg3 i.g6, a move which is still played by every leading expert on the white side of this position. On the other hand, Alekhine came up with fresh and inter esting approaches in nearly every standard opening of his day, and even showed an occa sional tolerance for modern eccentricities. He defended Marshall's use of the Modern Benoni, for example, and then in 1921, out of the blue,
THE MODERN OPENING RECONSIDERED 245
introduced the most hypermodern of all the defences of the Hypermodern Era, 1 e4 tiJf6. Although we sometimes hear that "A1ekhine never played the Alekhine Defence", he in fact played and annotated several well-known games with it, and even my historically-challenged database includes 10 tournament games in which he answered 1 e4 with l ...tiJf6. Ironic ally, this is one of the few established defences to 1 e4 which today is considered of rather mar ginal soundness, and has no consistent top class advocate. And yet (perhaps in deference to Alekhine's own greatness), most players of his time were convinced that l ...tiJf6 was per fectly sound. Spielmann talked about what a bother Alekhine' s Defence was to play against , and how "many players have been put off play ing 1 e4 by this defence." Tartakower praised it highly, and as late as 1943, Fine states categori cally: "All the efforts of both classicists and moderns have been in vain: Alekhine's De fence remains sound." Probably the most revealing opening for un derstanding Alekhine, at least with regard to his modern instincts, was the Sicilian Defence. At first, if one only follows his written notes, he seems to be almost absurdly dogmatic about l ...c5 (not to mention wrong). In his notes to Janowsky-Lasker, New York 1924, after 1 e4 c5 2 tiJf3 tiJc6, he remarks: " ... this is better than 2 ... e6 because Black, after 3 i.e2, can accom plish the blocking of White's c-pawn (tiJc3) by means of 3 ... tiJf6 (4 e5? tiJg4 5 d4 cxd4 6 i.f4 'ilic7)." Say what? This obsession with the dreaded 3 i.e2 continues later, when annotat ing Lasker-Tartakower. After 1 e4 c5 2 tiJf3 e6 3 tiJc3, Alekhine says "More to be recom mended is 3 i.e2", giving the lines 3 ...a6 4 O-O 'ilic7 5 c4 tiJf6 6 tiJc3 intending d4 and 3 ... tiJf6 4 tiJc3 intending e5, when after ... tiJd5, tiJxd5 and d4 will follow. Needless to say, there are several things wrong with this reasoning, for example, who would play 3 ...a6 and 4 ... 'ilic7 before d4 was in? (Actually, Alekhine himself did, but later criticized the idea!) Consider the best case for White using Alekhine's i.e2 idea, say, 1 e4 c5 2 tiJf3 e6 3 i.e2 tiJf6 4 tiJc3 tiJc6 (D) (naturally, 4 ...d5 is perfectly fine).
5 O-O (5 e5 tiJg4 !; but for the record, Ale
khine's line 5 ... tiJd5 6 tiJxd5 exd5 7 d4 would be nothing to write home about anyway after w 7 ...d6; for 5 d4, see the game below). Now Black can play simply 5 ...d5 6 exd5 exd5 or, if he really wants to be safe, 6 ... tiJxd5 7 tiJxd5 'ilixd5 with ... i.e? and ... O-O to come. Neverthe less, in his My Best Games volumes, Alekhine continues with this theme. Annotating his game against Bernstein, he says of 1 e4 c5 2 tiJf3 e6 3 tiJc3, "I am now convinced that the best move here is 3 i.e2, to be able to play c4 if Black adopts the Paulsen variation ( ...a6, ... 'ilic7, etc.)." With a little research, we soon discover that these opinions are shaped primarily by the re sults of Alekhine's own games, and not by in dependent theoretical investigation. It turns out that he had played the following game: Alekhine - Verlinsky Odessa 1918
1 e4 c5 2 tiJf3 tiJc6 3 d4 cxd4 4 tiJxd4 e6 5 tiJc3
tiJf6 6 i.e2 This is the same position as would arrive in the Lasker-Tartakower game notes after 3 i.e2 tiJf6 4 liJc3 e6 5 d4 cxd4 6 tiJxd4, so presum ably that is the transposition Alekhine was thinking about in his notes above. And in the game against Verlinsky, he won a very nice game, which probably accounts for his enthusi asm about this position. But today, it's easy to see that Black stands well here, as I'll indicate in my notes to the game. 6 ... i.b4! 7 O-O i.xc3 8 bxc3 tiJxe4 9 tiJxc6 dxc6 Even the eccentric 9 ...

22 i.c4 ti:lf8 23 :txb7 �xb7 24 :tb1+ 1-0 For the record, I'm not sure that Black should be resigning here ! Even 24 ... 'ii' b6! ? 25 :txb6+ axb6 is very interesting, since the bishop on g7 will also fall, e.g., 26 'ii' a3 :tdl+ 27 .tn :txg7 28 'ii' a6+ �b8 ! 29 'ii' xb6+ :tb7, etc. But being White in a game like this could convince one that the i.e2 idea was appropriate, since it could well lead to this apparently attractive variation. Similarly, it's quite possible that Alekhine became enthusiastic about this 3 i.e2 approach based upon the following win: Alekhine - Simisch Berlin 1923
1 e4 cS 2 ttlf3 ttlc6 3 i.e2
Alekhine explains: ''The text-move indicates White's intention to castle before undertaking any action in the centre." 3 ... e6 4 O-O d6!? Here 4 ... ti:lf6 5 ttlc3 d5 would equalize.

Alekhine gives this bizarre move an ' ! ' , ex- plaining: "White delays the plausible move 7 ttlc3 in order to play first c4, thus preventing all counterattack on the c-file." I need hardly point out how badly the bishop on f3 stands, even if Black develops quietly and allows c4 (see our discussion of Hedgehog positions).

7 ... ttle5 "To secure the advantage of the two bishops, which is rather illusory in this position. But this manoeuvre loses valuable time which would be better utilized in playing ... .te7, ...O-O, and ... i.d7, etc." (Alekhine). Well, ... ttle5 is a per fectly good move, but Alekhine is also right that normal development would be fine, and in fact it would leave the bishop looking rather silly on f3. Since White does achieve some attack after the text-move, 7 ... i.d7 or even 7 ... 'ii' b6 is prob ably preferable.

The rest of the game is deservedly famous, but not relevant for the opening. White builds up a huge attack and then overwhelms his opponent with a pretty sacrifice: 12 i.b2 i.f6 13 :tad1 a6 14 'ii' g3 'ii' c7 15 �h1 :td8 16 f4 b6 17 fS .teS 18 fxe6! ! i.xg3 19 exf7+ �h8 20 ttlds 1-0 This was an exhibition game, or perhaps Black would have played on, but Alekhine dem onstrates by lengthy analysis how 20 ...

THE MODERN OPENING RECONSIDERED 247
My point was to show how Alekhine came by this fondness for 3 i.e2 in the Sicilian. Es sentially, he had successes with it, and he also felt that it avoided a system which was clearly bothering him (Paulsen's 1 e4 c5 2 lbf3 e6 3 d4 cxd4 4 lbxd4 a6 followed by ... 1Wc7, an order which Alekhine himself had aimed for in his early Sicilian experiments as Black). So is that the end of the story? Not at all, and this is the in teresting part: Alekhine played 3 i.e2 versus the Sicilian, notwithstanding all of his procla mations, on only three occasions that I can find ! By contrast, he played the normal 2 lbf3 and 3 d4 (against 2 ... lbc6, 2 ...e6, and 2 ... d6) 27 times in the same database. Most of these latter games, moreover, came after he had made his notes above praising 3 i.e2. In other words, he had the open-mindedness and flexibility to recog nize the flaws in his own argument, and at some point, simply switched to the move which he recognized would offer him the best chances. In fact, once one recognizes the gap between Ale khine's rather dogmatic prose and his actual, pragmatic play, much of what he writes becomes easier to swallow. As a player, Alekhine's later games were marked by a great deal of experi mentation and latitude in the openings, and he was truly the first world-class player to cross the line from classical into modern play. The Analytical Revolution The next step in opening theory took place in the Soviet Union of the 1930s. In particular, Botvinnik was the first world champion who became known primarily as a methodical ana lyst of specific systems. The word 'systems' is particularly appropriate in his case, because he did not, like many contemporary players, have the propensity to play just about anything when it suited him. Instead, he submitted particular variations and structures to in-depth analysis and was loyal to them for periods of time. Imre Konig in his 1950 study of the evolution of openings, makes this interesting remark: "Bot vinnik, the present world champion, has been reproached for having a very limited range of openings, and for playing on the same lines all the time. This goes to prove that the modern age is the age of specialization, and that specializa tion is the only way to attain perfection." Well, his statement goes to prove that one should not extrapolate from the zeitgeist to the chess club! Although the modern world is indeed marked by specialization, modern chess is specifically characterized by its lack of specialization. For some time now, the leading players have played a much wider variety of openings and positions than ever before. Konig's comment on Bot vinnik may or may not have been appropriate for the specific time period he was writing in; but over the course of his career Botvinnik played a remarkable number of opening sys tems, analysing many of them to a depth previ ously unknown. The fact that he played fewer games than his contemporaries added to this impression for depth, since he would appear af ter a long absence armed with an array of new weapons. However, there was always impres sive variety in his opening play. As White, he relied mainly upon 1 d4 and 1 c4, developing much of the first independent theory about the latter move; but early in his career he used 1 e4 as well. And within the context of his 1 d4, he played at least two systems against every major black defence. As Black, he defended against 1 e4 with l...e5, two different Sicilian Defences, and the French Defence. Later, he added the Caro-Kann and Pirc Defences and played them consistently over the last stages of his career. Versus 1 d4, he used various l...d5 defences (Queen's Gambit Declined and Slav, for exam ple), the Griinfeld, and Dutch Defences, and he experimented with the Nimzo-Indian and King's Indian Defences. Compare that breadth with Lasker, for example, who seldom strayed from a straight and narrow 1 e4 e5 and 1 d4 d5; or with Capablanca, who did the same for many years until he added on some Caro-Kanns and Nimzo-Indians towards the end. Which age had the specialists? After Botvinnik, almost all masters routinely worked on their opening repertoires in his thor ough, systematic fashion. But wjth the possible exception of Smyslov, the next few champions relied upon their talent more than upon their openings. Certainly Tal and Petrosian were wont to play rather loosely in the opening; they had some ingenious ideas (as geniuses do), but hardly carried the comprehensive repertoires we see today. With Fischer, another leap in the depth of analysis took place comparable to that
248 SECRETS OF MODERN CHESS STRATEGY
introduced by Botvinnik. Fischer won numer ous games which were effectively over before move 20, even against top competition, by vir tue of his superior preparation. Whereas Bot vinnik surprised his opponents with openings worked out to move 10, for example, Fischer was suddenly prepared for positions arising on move 20 or later. The lesson was not lost on his peers, and chess hasn't been the same since. The post-Fischer era has been characterized by a flood of opening material which is so stagger ing that even specialists have to ignore large amounts of the information flowing in. Leading players spend most of their time working on openings, assisted by their friends and comput ers (who may also be their friends). All of this change is symbolized by Kasparov, whose preparation exceeds that of any of his contemporaries. A major difference between Kasparov and Fischer is that Kasparov carries full and enormously complex repertoires for both 1 e4 and 1 d4, plays 1 c4 with confidence, and has played a wide array of defences as well. For example, against 1 d4, he is known as the leading expert in both the Griinfeld and King's Indian Defences, but he has also played at championship level with the Queen's Gambit Declined, the Tarrasch Queen's Gambit, the Semi-Slav Defence, the Nimzo-Indian, and upon occasion, the Modern Benoni! Most 2200-level players can hardly keep up with one such defence, much less 5 or 6 at a time. By contrast, Fischer was very much a specialist, who had only just begun to play a few games with, for example, 1 c4 or alternate e-pawn defences like the Pirc when he quit chess. But the arsenal of weapons I described for Kaspa rov is not some freakish phenomenon limited to world-class geniuses. It is rapidly becoming the rule for leading players to carry large reper toires, as the reader may confirm by using their databases to make an openings chart for various top GMs. To be sure, a few players (most nota bly Karpov, and to a lesser extent, Kramnik) specialize in a small set of systems and count upon their in-depth knowledge to make up for their predictability; but the trend at the moment is very much in the opposite direction. Per sonally, I believe that the new flexibility in opening play makes for richer and more excit ing chess. An Overview of Contemporary Theory Let's take a tour through a few recent lnfor mators and try to relate the openings which catch our eye to various concepts discussed in this book. In that way, we will get a random, but hopefully typical, exposure to contemporary opening play. I will structure the discussion in five sections ('A' to 'E'), following the well known 'AOO-E99' opening structure used in the lnformators themselves. Be forewarned that this is not opening analysis, but a relatively un critical promenade through modern practice. My notes are simply guides to the strategies and modern concepts expressed in the games, and by no means detailed analysis. I hope that this section, casually presented as it is, will be fun and instructive for the player who wants to get a practical handle on how the concepts in this book work in practice.
AOO-A99
This section is the best source for 'avant-garde' games (see the end of this chapter), but also for the post-hypermodern openings which trade off space or development for other advantages. Here's an example relating back to our doubled pawn discussions: Korchnoi - Bacrot Enghien les Bains 1997 1 ti:Jf3 d5 2 b3 i.g4 3 i.b2 i.xf3 So typical these days ! Black casually cedes the bishops for doubled pawns. 4 gxf3 ti:Jf6 5 e3 c5 6 f4!? ti:Jc6 7 i.g2 e6 8 d3 g6! 9 c4?!

The revival of the Caro-Kann is in large part due to the discovery of players like Karpov and Speelman that Black can often benefit from keeping his king in the centre. Here are two simple examples which also feature Nimzo witsch's surrender of the centre, complete with the queenside fianchetto which was his favour ite plan in such positions: Kharitonov - Vandemirov Moscow 1996

A recent game Anand-Kasparov, Frankfurt 199S shows White pursuing a quiet strategy which would have seemed irrational to the Si cilian player of a few decades ago, but pays dividends: 14 'i!fd2 ltJe5 15 b3 e6 16 ltJde2! J:.cS 17 �d4 b5 l S ltJd 1 ! l:tgS 19 ltJe3 a5 20 O-O-O a4 2 1 �bl . White's centralized pieces protect against a real attack on his king, and in the meantime, Black's king is still in the centre. Eventually, this comes to haunt him: 2 l ...axb3 22 cxb3 J:.aS 23 �c3 l:ta6 24 ltJc2 �f8 25 ltJb4 J:.aS 26 ltJd4 �e7 27 :bel 'iWcS 2S �b2 'ii' b7 29 ltJdc2 f6 30 ltJd4 h4 3 1 g3 g4 32 f4 ltJf3 33 ltJxf3 gxf3 34 f5 hxg3 35 hxg3 l:txg3 36 'ii' h2 .l:.g5 37 �c1 l:tg7 3S 'ii' h5+ l:tt7 39 'ii' xf3 1-0.

Again, in these two examples, the side which better organized his minor pieces got the better game.

Black has made the trans formation we talked about on the queenside, at tacking a backward pawn on the open c-file (the 'remnant' of the doubled pawns) and exploiting the light squares. The play which follows is not perfect, but it well illustrates the dynamic themes for both sides. 17 ... l:.ac8?

The Avant-Garde Remember that mine is an attempt to describe modern chess as it exists, not as it will be; it would be foolish to try to predict where chess theory is heading. On the one hand, ten years from now, we may all be playing 1 e4 a6!? (the St George), 1 c4 g5 (Basman), and 1 e4 lDf6 2 e5 ltJe4 ! ? (Bucker's 'Mokele Mbembe') as if they were today's main-line Najdorfs. On the other hand, as players become strong at ever younger ages and as chess technique becomes more and more refined, we may run into a de ferred Capablanca Variation in which all the 'marginal' openings become essentially un playable, and the clamour for rule changes re appears following a Leko-Bacrot match with 29 draws out of 30 games. At the moment, nei ther of these scenarios seems very likely. Our grandmasters seem able to resist the lure of such bizarre openings; and, despite the com puter take-over of our opening notebooks, the number of playable variations is expanding all the time. But who knows? One thing to consider about the evolution of opening theory is that until now, to my knowledge, almost all radical ideas which en tered the mainstream have come from strong players. That is to say, the romantic notion of an underground community of lesser players gen erating new ideas, which are subsequently ac cepted by leading players, corresponds to no reality that I am aware of. I am not a chess his torian, and forgive me if I'm treading on dan gerous, non-expert ground here. But I don't believe that there were persistent advocates for Alekhine's Defence ( 1 e4 lDf6) before he used the idea, and didn't Nimzowitsch develop the Nimzo-Indian (1 d4 ltJf6 2 c4 e6 3 ltJc3 i.b4) and Queen's Indian (1 d4 ltJf6 2 c4 e6 3 lDf3 b6) without significant historical or outside in fluence? Similarly, Reti was one of the world's leading players when he developed his system. Some modern Sicilian Defences had older roots, to be sure, but from strong players like Paulsen. The truly radical Najdorf Sicilian and previously-discredited King's Indian were ad vocated by a series of strong Soviet masters in cluding some of the leading lights of the 1940s and 1950s. Perhaps the Volgograd masters who developed what we in the West call the Benko Gambit (1 d4 lLlf6 2 c4 c5 3 d5 b5) were not leading grandmasters, but they were very strong players. And although the Trompowsky Attack ( 1 d4 lDf6 2 i.g5) only recently came into prominence under the guidance of British grandmasters, Hort, Vaganian and others were playing it in the early 1970s. Arguably, Trom powsky himself (a Brazilian master) was a lower-level source, but it's not as though he had a serious following which ushered 2 i.g5 into respectability. Well, I'm sure that there are exceptions to this trend, but if it persists, that doesn't bode well for the fate of truly eccentric new openings such as those mentioned at the beginning of this section, or for the likes of 1 g4 or l lDh3. To be sure, there exists a community of fairly strong 'new-wave' players such as Stefan Biicker, Mi chael Basman, Gerard Welling, and GM Jonny
THE MODERN OPENING RECONSIDERED 263
Hector who write about and play such things, and a much larger set of lower-level followers. Basman, for example, plays and advocates such things as 1 a3 (and 2 b4), 1 h3 (and 2 g4), l...a6, and l...h6. The move 1 g4 (originally a Basman favourite until he found the 'improvement' 1 h3 !), has been played by GM Skembris and a few IMs. Furthermore, Jonny Hector has even experimented with some wonderful things like

by Miles's victory over Karpov in Skara 1980 using 1 e4 a6! ? (a red letter day in new-wave history), there haven't been any 'sightings' in the top-level grandmasterranks. It will be inter esting to see if such ideas ever prove capable of percolating up into the higher ranks. That said, let's continue our tour through re cent lnformators for a few examples of what's new, if not really bizarre (I have heard that lnformator editors do not look kindly on the bi zarr e!). GM Kengis has some sophisticated ver sions of ... b6 openings which are more 'modem' than the mere Modem Defence, for example: Lalic - Kengis European Team Ch, Pula 1997 1 tl:Jf3 b6 2 e4 i.b7 3 tl:Jc3 g6 4 d4 i.g7 5 i.c4 e6 6 O-O tlJe7 Completing the second-rank piece-placement!

My hope is that the reader, in a similar way, will relate the ideas in this book to some of the new games which come to his attention. 1 4 Playing Modern Chess; Conclusion How does one actually play modern chess? As I have said before, this is not an instructional book. But the majority of readers will certainly be players, and players who are looking to im prove their game. Having come to an end of this lengthy work, I'm sure that many of you will be saying something along the lines of: "OK, but what do I do when confronted with these issues over the board? It's all well and good to speak of being independent of rules and principles, but what should I then use for guidance?" Looking at Part 2 on a chapter-by-chapter basis, one finds that I have indeed largely defined modern chess in terms of its ambiguities and not its certainties. With respect to pawns, for example, we learned that modern players will often neglect development for structure, allow backward pawns in the opening, move pawns in front of their king, attack the front of a pawn chain, and advance flank pawns when the cen tral situation is unresolved. On the other hand, they will just as often do the traditional thing (develop quickly, avoid backward pawns, keep kingside pawns on their original squares, etc.). The situation with respect to minor-piece issues is also muddy. We found that bad bishops are often not bad at all, that knights can be strong on the edge of the board, and worst of all, that the knight-pair can be superior to the bishop pair in either very closed, semi-closed, or wide-open positions! You can successfully grab flank pawns in the opening with your queen when you're staggeringly behind in develop ment; or you can do so and quickly be mated. And so forth when it comes to exchange sacri fices, prophylaxis, etc. Looked at from a dis tance, this is all not much help, and perhaps a good reason to take up carpentry or writing mystery novels. But we aren't looking from a distance; we are looking at concrete games and positions. This is the level at which real improvement takes place; you have to develop your intuition and judgement by studying countless actual situations. I think the frustrated player desiring to achieve mastery has to confront that reality before anything else. Once we accept that gen eral rules are inadequate to lift our play to the next level, the question of what constitutes chess knowledge can be addressed. And here we get some rather surprising answers. 'How to-improve' chess books may well be able to raise the level of your practical skills or even your rating (although I am sceptical of the de gree to which they can do so beyond a certain playing strength). But they won't do much, if anything, for your knowledge of the game it self. Such books can only deal with one side of the equation, for example, thinking techniques, psychological approaches, and sporting consid erations (e.g., time management, repertoire choice, and the like). But your knowledge of the interplay of positional and tactical ele ments, and the paradoxical nuances of initiative and momentum, for example, are a separate and ultimately more important realm. Let's again see what our friend Suba has to say about this subject: "Most books on 'modern theory' consider that improving one's play by studying strategy means reaching the superior level of a player who has had that instruction. That may be partly true, but I would warn you that the dogma introduced may have a detri mental effect on your creativity. Try to read such books with a critical eye, as if you do not believe a word of what they say. Memorize opening variations, endgame techniques, com binations, ideas, even whole games if you can, but not rules and dogma." This last sentence is a remarkably honest proposal ! After all, it runs counter to the advice of just about every instructional book or maga zine article out there ! Haven't you seen it time and again: "Don't memorize openings;just learn the 'principles' behind them" ... "you shouldn't be trying to learn by heart; understanding the 'ideas' is what really counts" ... "young players spend too much time learning openings, when
266 SECRETS OF MODERN CHESS STRATEGY
they should be mastering the fundamental prin ciples of the game", and so forth? This advice is given with a straight face by strong grand masters whose entire time is occupied by (and whose chess upbringing consisted primarily of) studying and memorizing opening variations and whole games ! And if this were an endgame book, I could say something less strong but similar: grandmaster authors who for years were drilled and inundated with the memoriza tion of specific endings breezily inform their readers that they shouldn't be learning a lot of specific endings by heart, but rather be absorb ing fine principles about rooks behind passed pawns and bringing the king into play! Well, as Tisdall absolutely correctly says, rules "gain more general relevance the later the stage of the game they refer to", and therefore I acknowl edge that endgame principles are definitely worth paying heed to. But even in that stage of the game, as any prolonged association with grandmasters will teach you, a concrete knowl edge-base of countless specific positions both informs those rules and is essential to their cor rect application. Think of spoken language. When you speak a language well, you aren't pausing in mid sentence to think about whether the verb should be active or passive, or how to conjugate it, nor worrying about the case or gender of a noun. Similarly, in chess, the GM doesn't spend much (if any) of his time in a position thinking "is that outpost strong for my knight?" or even "how do I improve the position of my worst piece?". Rather, he already knows how good or bad the knight is there, and automatically takes into ac count the badly-placed piece. He simultaneously weighs such factors in with a few hundred other considerations, most of which he is familiar with because he has faced similar positions be fore. Sure, he might occasionally 'step back' from the board and consider general issues, but anyone who has analysed extensively with strong players knows that the concrete possibil ities in analysis dominate, with such positional factors being simply imbued in the play itself, as the rules of gramm ar are in spoken language. One's real positional understanding increases non-verbally as one refines one's judgement. When we consider further, the language comparison becomes less precise, but still useful: for example, grammatical rules almost always apply, whereas chess ones can actually be wrong, or so unreliable as to be worthless. Thus, whereas one can at least imagine learning a language with tolerable fluency simply by ap plying the rules of grammar, a similarly me chanical application of chess rules would be disastrous. Moreover, even with its better re cord of accuracy, grammar is learned in prac tice mainly by example, along with the relevant exceptions. This implies that at the very least, any chess principles should be learned in a real istic context, with attendant ambiguities, and also with plenty of counter-examples. This con trasts with the approach which most chess books take. To quote Suba again: "A game which is a 'model of strategy' is a rare bird between two players of a similar level. Classical strategy presupposes that you play with much weaker (or much stronger!) opponents ... [In the exam ples given by classical theory,] the side with the disadvantage totally lacks any counterplay, and generally not only the author's but also any other logical plan will win. Today such posi tions rarely appear, particularly between play ers of the same strength." In other words, the way we are supposed to learn our general prin ciples (grammar) from such books is not by ex amining realistic games (sentences as actually spoken), but by being spoon-fed one-sided, un realistic positions (highly idealized construc tions which only confuse us when we later visit the country in which the language is spoken). So back to the question of how to play mod ern chess. This book, I repeat, cannot teach you how; but the contrasting examples of concrete play which I've given (if I've done my job well) should help you to get started towards building up a language of modern chess, consisting of its vocabulary, phrases, sentences, conceptual nu ances, and implied grammar. To the extent that general chess theory helps, it does so because it trains your eye to look for various elements and techniques which constitute such a language, and lends them some unity. Hence, even the rel atively abstract discussions I have provided on prophylaxis, dynamism, time, and initiative have been interwoven with examples, and will hopefully direct the reader's thoughts towards recognizing how those elements play out in ac tual games.
PLAYING MODERN CHESS; CONCLUSION 267
Conclusion We have arrived at the end of this work, and it's time to look back at what's been accomplished. The primary purpose of this book was to pres ent the ways in which modern chess theory dif fers from classical theory. What have we found? In Part 1, we concentrated mainly on features of modern play which constituted modest revi sions to older thought, for example: a) new conceptions of development, e.g., an abandonment of the 'move each piece once' principle; b) a pragmatic materialism, expressed in grabbing flank pawns in the opening; c) a willingness to take on mobile but vul nerable central pawn-masses; d) the evolution of minority-attack theory and gradual decline in the importance of pawn majorities and passed pawns in the middle game; e) a more sophisticated approach to doubled and tripled pawns which includes willingness to accept them in return for control over key central squares, and new methods of exploiting doubled pawns by dominating colour com plexes; f) a working out of, and pragmatic approach to, isolated queen's pawn positions; g) increased knowledge of minor-piece trade-offs; h) a mild evolution of rook play along ranks; i) exchanges for the sake of colour-complex play. In Part 2, more definitive theoretical shifts were discussed. Many of these revolved around the general concept of 'rule-independence', whereby the classical edifice of rules and prin ciples is rejected. In almost every case, a prag matic decision founded in concrete analysis turns out to be preferable to such rules, as shown by these modern tendencies: a) ignoring development to make purely structural gains, or for prophylactic purposes; b) happily accepting 'permanently' back ward pawns; c) taking on doubled pawns for dynamic reasons; d) moving the pawns in front of one's king; e) developing bishops before knights, or queens before the other pieces; f) attacking the front of the pawn-chain (as opposed to the base); g) advancing flank pawns when one's cen tre isn't secure and/or when one's pieces aren't developed; h) the almost routine acceptance of 'bad' bishops and knights on the edge of the board; i) opening the position when one has knights, and stabilizing it when one has bishops. Those are advances relating to rule-independ ence. Then there are the broader features of the ory and practical play which have characterized modern chess, for example: a) long-term positional pawn sacrifices; b) the increasing use of the fianchetto; c) resolution of bishop-pair issues; d) new ideas about the worth of knight out posts and superfluous pieces; e) the ubiquitous exchange sacrifice; f) completely new handling of the knight pair versus the bishop-pair; g) the increasing use of prophylaxis; h) the tendency to replace 'the accumula tion of small advantages' by dynamic play; i) the use of elastic opening systems; j) advances in creating asymmetrical posi tions; k) depth of opening preparation; and so forth. I have engaged in other speculative discus sions as well (Are queen and knight better than queen and bishop? Is chess a draw? Are rook endings drawish?); but the above lists summa rize the type of issues which reflect the primary purpose of the book, i.e., to describe the ad vances of modern chess. In addition, I hope that I have at least provided the reader with some of the spirit and flavour of today's game. While contemporary play is difficult to get a handle on, it is also more open-ended and creative than during any other age. That is a good thing. Certainly, it is legiti mate to fret over the future effects computers may have on chess; but we should also appreci ate the exciting reality we have now. What's more, the creativity which young players are exhibiting today can only broaden and enrich the game further. I am confident that in the com ing years, the ideas and trends described in this book will develop in ways none of us could imagine, which is as we would want it to be. Bibliogra phy Some day, I would like to do a heavily-commented bibliography, explaining all the strengths and weaknesses of the books I've referred to. Instead, to preserve precious space, let me just point out a few of the books I would consider the most interesting or fun to read in conjunction with my own. First, if you haven't already, you should read Nimzowitsch's My System. It is not only a path breaking work by a great player, but also a humorous book which brings theory to life. I gather that My System is a blast to read in German or Danish, if you have either facility. Next, for a truly mod ern and eccentric point of view as well as a lot of fun, Suba's Dynamic Chess Strategy is highly rec ommended. My first impression of his book was that, apart from the superb games, it was rather exaggerated and superficial. But when I was preparing my own work, I realized that he was perhaps the only writer who had worried about the same topics and come to the same conclusions as I had; and, what's more, he had expressed his views eloquently and humorously. For the serious student, Dvoretsky's books are deservedly praised and the best thing available for advanced players. I've only mentioned three of his seven books which have appeared in Eng lish; Positional Play has more to say about the issues I've examined than the others. There is some rather vacuous filler material in parts of this series; but that is more than made up for by its rare originality and wisdom. On a somewhat more basic level, Jeremy Silman's Reassess Your Chess is already a classic, and the favourite of students everywhere. For Nimzowitsch fans, Keene's Reap praisal has some wonderful gems, and in particular, it covers the period after Chess Praxis, which most students know little about. I also strongly recommend Steve Mayer's little-known work Bishop versus Knight: The Verdict. It may seem uneven at times, but that is because he is undertak ing the rare task of actually writing an original book about an unexplored subject. That is far more difficult than patching together another rehash of old material such as we continually find at the bookseller's table at tournaments. To his great credit, Mayer succeeds in both raising our under standing of minor-piece play and adding to the theory of this subject. Finally, for those who are looking to improve their play or just be entertained (with a lot of philosophy and a taste of theory), Jon Tisdall's recent Improve Your Chess Now will delight a wide range of players including, I think, experienced grandmasters. That said, here is a limited list of the sources most frequently consulted and cited in Secrets of Modern Chess: Advances Since Nimzowitsch. I should mention that the Euwe and Kramer book and Pachman's series are the ones so often referred to in the text. I have used them as the leading ex amples of the traditional middle game book, with all the limitations that implies; but it also has to be allowed that they are diligent and thoughtful efforts in their own right, and the best of their genre.

This book fulf i l s the need for a thoro u g h , profo u n d work o n the modern h an d l i n g of chess positions, and how N i mzowitsc h ' s theories - sti l l controve rsia and revo l utionary at the time My System was written - have been ref i n ed and used a l o n g s i d e c l ass i cal concepts. The f i rst sectio n of the book d i scusses how the u nderstan d i n g of c l assical themes, such as pawn maj o r ities, the centre and structural weaknesses, have been ref i ned . Watson then moves on to d i scuss new co ncepts, i n c l u d i n g the wi l l i n g ness of modern p l ayers to accept backward pawns i n retu rn for dynamic p l ay, the idea of a good ' bad ' bishop, k n i g hts f i n d i n g usefu l roles at the edge of the board and the exchange sacrifice i d eas that became preval ent with the post-war Sovi et worl d champions.
