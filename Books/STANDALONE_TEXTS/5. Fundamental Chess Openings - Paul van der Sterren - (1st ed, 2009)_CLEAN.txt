Introduction In the colossal body of chess literature, no aspect of the game has been treated as extensively as th openings. In varying degrees of expertise, clarity and depth, thousands of books discuss ever imaginable and unimaginable opening the game of chess has to offer. This is a process that wil never stop. As long as a particular opening is being played, its variations will be worked out deepe and deeper and assessments will be modified on the basis of these new experiences. As long a chess is alive, its opening theory will also be alive and new books will be needed to document all o this new life. This book intends to introduce the reader to this strange but fascinating world, the world of open ing theory. There will be no long sequences of moves, no complicated analysis and no real attempt ti keep up with the very latest developments. Instead I shall attempt to clarify the background, the gene sis and the development of all major openings and try to show how they are much more intercon nected and based on the same ideas and insights than many people think. This approach makes thi book a very different one from the usual opening manuals. It could perhaps be said to precede them. 1 it has the effect on the reader that it whets his appetite for these 'usual' opening books, or at leas makes him understand them a little bit better, this book will have fulfilled its purpose. What is Opening Theory? Everyone who devotes even the tiniest amount of thought to his first move not only makes a stai with that particular game but also with the development of opening theory. From that moment on every new game will confront him with the starting position again and therefore with his earlie thoughts on it. Also he will sooner or later find out that millions of other players have pondered ex actly the same problems and, whether he wants to or not, he will to some extent start comparing hi own ideas about how to start a game with theirs. This means that opening theory arises quite naturally with the start of a game. No one can avoii it. It ends, equally naturally, with the end of a game. If we pursue our thinking about the openin, position logically and systematically, while accepting only the highest possible degree of ccrtaint as a satisfactory result, we cannot end our investigation unless we are sure we have reached cither winning or a drawn position. Seen in this light, thinking about the starting position involves a thor ough examination of the middlegame and endgame as well. It could be said then, that opening theory does not really exist, al least not as something separat from other aspects of the game. Ultimately, opening theory comprises all theory. However, since the human brain and even the computer is still not capable of completely seein, through (and thereby destroying) chess as a whole, in practice opening theory does not end with ai empty board but in positions where there is a certain consensus about how they should be assessed for instance 'chances are equal' or 'White (or Black) has the advantage'. Sometimes a question can be answered with total confidence. In the position after 1 e4 there i some room for discussion on how good or bad l...g5 is (though not much), but if White continues 1 d4 here, there can be no question on the value of 2,..f6 because 3 Rh5# is then mate. End of game end of theory'. But in most cases an assessment is merely a temporary stop. The moment somebody starts ques tioning it. the argument continues. Until the next temporary stop is reached.
INTRODUCTION 7
And so, ever since the beginnings of chess, every single chess-player has contributed something to that gigantic construction called opening theory. This brings us to the next question. How Much Theory Should a Player Know? The most severe answer to this has to be 'everything', the softest 'as much as you like' and the pro- foundest 'nothing'. All three are correct. Knowledge of opening theory is a double-edged sword. The player who knows a lot will un- doubtedly profit by his knowledge, but he may also live in constant fear of meeting an opponent who knows even more. Everyone who has studied opening theory in depth will have learned that, no matter how well you do your work, there is always the possibility of having overlooked some- thing or of not having looked deep enough. Trying to keep abreast of the latest developments, read- ing everything, keeping a close watch on the Internet, makes you very knowledgeable but also acutely aware of the possibility of missing something. In short, he who lives by the sword shall die by the sword. It is therefore of the utmost importance for a chess-player to find his own personal balance be- tween knowing too much and knowing too little. The purpose of studying opening theory should not be accumulating any set amount of knowledge, but being content with whatever knowledge one has. For someone with a natural flair for study, it may be perfect to work on openings all the time. For someone who is much less scientifically minded, even the slightest attempt to study openings may well be superfluous and even detrimental to his game. But there is another aspect of studying opening theory to be mentioned. Anyone with even the slightest intellectual bent of mind (and which chess-player isn't 9) may find getting to know a little bit about opening theory very interesting. Even without any ambition to improve your results and independent of your level of play, you may simply find the study of openings very enjoyable. You may also discover that this has absolutely nothing to do with memorizing variations or the need to occupy yourself with chess more than you want to. This sheer fun is in my view an essential element of studying opening theory. It is my hope that this book will make some of this pleasure visible and perceptible. The book contains an overview of all major openings, how they have evolved through the years and how they are looked upon to- day, early in the 21st century. I shall be just sketching the outlines and will be very concise, but per- haps this is precisely the way to convey the fascination that opening theory has always had for me. Opening theory has been an almost inexhaustible source of pleasure for me throughout my active chess years. I sincerely hope it may be the same for you. The First Move The two most important opening moves by far are 1 e4and 1 d4. By playing either of these classical moves, While uses his right to open the game to occupy as large a portion of the centre as possible. He also opens lines and diagonals for his queen and one of his bishops and creates a possible square of development for one of his knights. Slightly more modest, yet still very respectable, are 1 c4 and 1 <5)f3. With these moves. White does not immediately occupy any of the centre squares (e4, d4, e5 and d5) but he controls them, which is strategically just as important. He does this from the side or, in military terms, on the flank. That is why these two opening moves are called Flank Openings. It is mainly on these four moves that the grand structure of opening theory has been erected. Bor- dering on that structure (in the grounds so to speak) are the modest cottages of 1 g3, 1 b3. 1 f4 and 1 €Bc3, while with other moves we gradually get bogged down in the marshlands surrounding the es- tate, lands which have hardly been made inhabitable and perhaps had better remain so. We shall start our investigation with 1 d4. 1 d4 Speaking in very general terms, one might say this is the more strategically orientated of White's two main opening moves. If. on your classical opening move, the equally classical symmetrical reply is what you expect, then you know that after 1 e4 e5 you will immediately be able to attack an undefended pawn with 2 Nf3 (or the much more radical 2 f4). White then has an obvious object of attack which makes the sit- uation relatively clear and straightforward. After 1 d4 d5 things are very different be- cause Black's pawn on d5 is securely defended. Yet on closer inspection it turns out that White is able to attack Black's central stronghold, mainly because of the possibility of 2 c4. This attack has a different feel and is slower than White's plans in the equivalent position after 1 e4 e5. It is based on a long-term positional plan and therefore more of a strategic nature. That is why 1 d4 did not really flourish until the rise of positional play in the late 19th century. Until then 1 e4 was by far the most popular move. This means that practically from the start, theory of the 1 d4 openings has been developed by players whose general outlook on chess was similar to ours today. That is why almost all of these openings are still very much alive, which can hardly be said of the 1 e4 complex. Espe- cially in the 1 e4 e5, section quite a lot of the old theory has by now been shelved permanently.
1 d4 (D)
Black's most classical reply has already been mentioned: l...d5. Until about 1920, this was by far the most highly regarded and in some periods practically the only 'approved' move. The cru- cial position arises if White then plays 2 c4, the Queen's Gambit. Black's principal defences to this set-up have grown into three major, inde- pendent openings: the Queen's Gambit De- clined (2...e6), the Slav Defence (2...c6) and the Queen's Gambit Accepted (2...dxc4). These openings will be the subject of the first three li chapters of this book. In the fourth I shall give an overview of Black's less popular replies to 2 c4 and of White's alternatives to 2 c4. Around 1920 the classical move l...d5 began to be seriously challenged by the rise of an alter- native: Hesitant at first, suffering much scorn and sarcasm, then quickly gathering mo- mentum and eventually quite triumphantly, this move has risen to the top of the bill. Traditional theory had stated that 1...'2Bf6, al- though it does have the merit of controlling c4 and thus preventing 2 c4, had little more to offer against the logical 2 c4 (D) than a hasty retreat to the safe ground of the Queen's Gambit with
2...e6 followed by 3...d5 and therefore had little
independent significance. In due course it became clear, however, that Black does not have just one. but several impor- tant possibilities. In fact, the position after 1 d4 Nf6 2 c4 turned out a real goldmine of new openings. Most of these rose to prominence shortly after World War II and l...£jf6 has been Black's most popular defence to 1 d4 ever since. To begin with, it was discovered that Black has 2...e6 3 Nc3 jlb4. the Nimzo-Indian De- fence. Then it turned out that Black has two al-

1 ...?)f6 until that move became popular around
1920. The rise of the Indian openings pushed
the Dutch Defence into the background, but there it has held a respectable position ever since. I...d5, 1 ...<2)f6 and l...f5 are moves that pre- vent the opponent from taking up the ideal cen- tral pawn-formation by playing 2 e4, which is what White would undoubtedly do if Black were to push his clock without making a move. And yet, the term 'ideal central pawn-formation' is perhaps a misleading one. It is not only a matter of how White (or Black) places his pawns in the centre, it is equally important (and perhaps even more so) what he can do with those centre pawns in any given situation. A broad pawn-centre can be strong, but it can also be vulnerable. It is strong if it cramps the enemy position or if it forms a base for an at- tack. It is vulnerable if it is being attacked, and it is weak when it crumbles as a result of that attack. It is a perfectly legitimate opening strategy for Black to let White build up a central pawn- formation to his liking. If he does so without a plan and the necessary determination to fight back at the first opportunity, however, opening theory will regard this as a betrayal of its princi- ples and turn its back on the offender. But if he acts with a plan and with determination, the re- sult may be a fascinating opening struggle. In that case Black allows his opponent to form a broad pawn-centre only with the firm intention to annihilate it. The major representatives of this category of openings are l...e6, l...d6 and l...g6. A respect- able body of theory has been developed around all three of these moves, especially in the last three decades, but to put this into perspective (for, after all, this is still only a fraction of the theory attached to the 'big' 1 d4 openings) I have condensed this into a single chapter. of 3 Chc3, namely 3...b6. the Queen's Indian Defence, and 3..Bb4+, the Bogoljubow De- fence or Bogo-Indian. All three have devel- oped into very reliable openings, which are unlikely ever to disappear again. Even more spectacular was the gradual ac- ceptance of 2...g6. No fewer than two new openings were introduced here, both equally important today and equally forceful: after 3 Nc3 the move 3...jLg7 produces the King's Indian Defence, while 3...d5 is the Griinfeld Defence. Finally, Black also has the possibility of
2...c5. which is called the Benoni. This open-
ing contains a surprisingly large number of subvariations, all offering Black an interesting game. All of these openings will get a chapter of their own. We shall then consider some minor alternatives on Black's second move and we shall see what happens if White refrains from playing 2 c4. Apart from l...d5 and l... f6, Black has several other replies, of which l...f5, the Dutch Defence, is the most important, at least in a his- torical sense. In the 19th century, this opening was considered the only reasonable alternative to the classical 1 ...d5. It was ranked far above Queen's Gambit Declined
1 d4 d5
2 c4 e6
The Queen's Gambit Declined is one of the oldest 1 d4 openings and has a long history. As long ago as the 1 9th century, when 1 c4 was still by far the most popular move, l...d5 2 c4 e6 was the accepted reply to the far less respected I d4. With the rise of positional chess, atten- tion shifted heavily to I d4 and the Queen's Gambit Declined automatically became the most important of all openings. In the 1927 match for the World Championship between Alekhine and Capablanca, for instance, the Queen's Gambit Declined was played in 32 of the 34 games (and I e4 only once). No doubt as a reaction to this one-sidedness, a much broader range of openings was developed after this, but the Queen's Gambit Declined has al- ways remained important, simply because it is regarded as an intrinsically sound and trust- worthy way of playing. Black prepares to recapture on d5 with his e-pawn if necessary, while at the same time opening a diagonal for the king's bishop. He thus holds his ground in the centre and sets up a very natural plan of development for his pieces. White now has two plausible moves, 3 €k3 and 3 ?)f3. The main significance of 3 Nf3 lies in preparing the Catalan Opening, which arises after 3...5)f6 4 g3 and will be dealt with at the end of this chapter. 3 <Sc3 (D) This is the most usual move, which brings us to our first major parting of the ways: With 3...c5 Black claims an equal share of the centre at once. This is called the Tarrasch Defence. He can also play 3...c6, This move is based on a very clever idea and is much more aggres- sive than it looks. This is the Noteboom (or Abrahams) Variation. Then we have the simple developing moves
3...Nf6 and 3...Xe7, It is with either of these
that the Queen's Gambit Declined proper is reached. Finally, the move 3....Nb4 has been played on and off, especially in the 1990s. This is an attempt to combine two different openings, the Queen's Gambit Declined and the Nimzo- Indian Defence. Black keeps all options open to go either way depending on White's reply, a strategy that may well unsettle an opponent with a narrow opening repertoire. Theory has not yet managed to get a firm grip on this line, but one of White's best options seems to be 4 a3. By forcing his opponent's hand, White at- tempts to turn the situation around and use whatever Black plays (after 4...J.xc3+ 5 bxc3) to achieve a favourable variation of the Nimzo- Indian. Tarrasch Defence 3 ... c5 (D) This was regarded as the only correct move by Siegbert Tarrasch (1862-1934), one of the world's best players in his day and an extremely influential theoretician. His basic assertion was that White cannot very well take on d5 because

tension and developing the queenside with ' dxc5 jLxc5 8 b4 and 9 ±b2. 4 ... exd5 This recapture seems natural, yet Black ha: the option of trying to grab the initiative by sac rificing a pawn: 4...cxd4. This is called the Schara-Hennig Gambit and its main line run:
5 Qxd4 5'c6 (I suspect being able to play thi:
beautiful move is all the justification that quilt a number of Schara-Hennig fans need) 6 Wd exd5 7 Qxd5 Nd7 8 Nf3 2>f6 9 Qd 1 Nc5 10 el "e7 11 Ne2 O-O-O 12 O-O g5. There is a shaq middlegame ahead which offers rather mon scope for short-term tactical calculations that for considerations of a positional nature.
5 Nf3 2tc6 (D)
that would give Black "the advantage of an iso- lated d-pawn after 4 cxd5 exd5". Tarrasch val- ued open lines and freedom of movement for his pieces so highly that he considered it irre- sponsible for White to play like this and judged
4 e3 to be the best move, whereupon it was of
course Black's turn to avoid making the same mistake by taking on d4. His view of the situa- tion was that both players should wait for a fa- vourable opportunity to break the tension in the centre. Since then, the evaluation of the isolated queen's pawn has changed considerably. Pawns may become weak, especially when they are isolated. The judging of these positions could be said to have become a very personal affair and it is only natural that some famous grand- masters have often and successfully used the Tarrasch Defence (for example. Spassky' and Kasparov) while others have never even tried it. 4 cxdS
4 e3 is hardly ever played nowadays, yet
some positions resulting from this move are still relevant because they may also arise from very different openings. The position after 4... f6 5 Nf3 Nc6, for instance, is often reached via the Symmetrical English: e.g., 1 f3 <2Tf6 2 c4 c5 3 Nc3 Nc6 4 e3 e6 5 d4 d5. White then usually takes on d5 anyway but the subtle waiting move 6 a.3 is popular as well, when Black often adopts the same strategy by playing 6...a6. In this posi- tion White has another useful waiting move in 7 b3 (in the best tradition of Tarrasch!) though this is also a good moment for releasing the 6 g3 Decades of practical experience have turner this into the main line of the Tarrasch Defence The alternative 6 c3 <53f6 is not unimportant, bu it is usually reached via other openings. White' standard continuations are 7 Ji.e2 and 7 JsLbS These variations are not as sharp or as deepi; worked out as the ones arising from 6 g3. 6 ... Nf6 The provocative move 6...c4. which give the game a totally different face, is an importan and interesting alternative. This is called th Swedish Variation. Black takes a somewha intimidating step forward on the queenside an, tries to cramp his opponent's position. Whit has two standard strategies at his disposal t try to break up Black's pawn-formation: b3 an - even more forceful - a well-timed e4 and pla

is likely to revolve around either of these. After 7 jlg2 Bb4 8 O-O <2ige7 the thrust 9 e4 is al- ready possible for White regains his pawn after

This innocent-looking little move is in fact the first step into one of the most exciting varia- tions the world of chess openings has to offer.
4 Qf3
By playing this natural move, flexible and aimed at a development of his pieces. White al- lows the Noteboom Variation, which is also known as the Abrahams Variation. There are three major alternatives, the most popular one being 4 e3. This normally leads to the Meran Variation of the Semi-Slav Defence (page 33) after 4...Q>f6 5 I2)f3. but Black may also choose to go for a relatively favourable version of the Stonewall Variation of the Dutch Defence (page 175) by playing ...f5. 4 cxd5 is an attempt to reach the Exchange Variation (page 22), but White's options are limited here as compared to the 'regular' ways to reach this line. After4...exd5 the move 5 Bg5 is not possible while 5 Bf4 allows 5...Bd6, giv- ing Black a much easier game than in the Ex- change Variation proper.
4 e4 is very interesting. This is a totally logi-
cal move, which has one disadvantage only, i.e.
4...dxe4 5 Nxe4 Jlb4+. Now the retreat 6 <53c3
offers little hope of an advantage because it gives Black the opportunity for a counter-thrust in the centre: 6...c5. The critical move is 6 ±d2, sacri- ficing one or even two pawns after 6...Rxd4 7 ±xb4 Rxe4+ 8 Jle2 (or 8 <2)e2). White has a sound lead in development, but Black's posi- tion has no real weaknesses. After some years of great popularity during the 1990s. White seems to have lost interest in this gambit. 4 ... dxc4 (D) This is the most important starting position of the Tarrasch Defence. No other opening of- fers Black such free and easy development for his pieces. One might easily be led to believe that it was actually Black who started the game! In fact White's only chance lies in putting pres- sure on Black's d-pawn, but although this is White's only option it is also a very dangerous one, especially in the hands of a skilled posi- tional player, so it would be wrong to assume that everything is going Black's way in this po- sition. Whether one prefers White or Black is - at least to a certain extent - a matter of taste. A large number of moves have grown into major variations here. 9 Be3, 9 jLf4, 9 b3 and even the at first sight rather unimpressive 9 a3 are not bad, yet the outstanding main lines are 9 dxcS Jlxc5 10 Jlg5 and 9 Ag5. After the latter move, Black has a choice of 9...Be6, 9...c4 and
9...cxd4 10 -53xd4 h6. Some of these lines have
been analysed deep into the endgame, but this should not be as alarming as it sounds since play is of a very logical nature here which makes the variations fairly easy to understand. Noteboom (or Abrahams) Variation 3 ... c6 (D)
14 FUNDAMENTAL CHESS OPENINGS
Taking on c4 is a major theme in many varia- tions of the Queen's Gambit, its consequences being subtly different in almost every case. 5 e3 What makes this particular line so surpris- ingly uncontrollable is that this seemingly mod- est and reticent reply to Black's capture on c4, is in reality the starting point of the truly mind- boggling complications of the Noteboom Main Line. The seemingly more aggressive 5 e4 is less forcing (Black replies 5...b5 6 a4 jLb4) and considerably less popular, as is 5 JigS, though both these moves may well be worth some deeper investigation. 5 a4 has no independent significance after 5...Bb4 6 e3 (or 6 e4) 6...b5. 5 ... b5
6 a4 i_b4
7 3.d2 White manages to win back the pawn be- cause he still has the break b3 up his sleeve, but the real point of the Noteboom is that Black has a particularly venomous answer to this. 7 ... Nb7
7...a5, based on exactly the same idea, has
also been played. Theory has not quite decided yet what the most accurate move is, but they usually lead to the same position, shown in the next diagram. 8 axb5 Bxc3
9 Jlxc3 cxb5
10 b3 aS (D)
This is the point and the reason why the Noteboom Variation has deserved its promi- nent place in chess theory. After 1 1 bxc4 b4 12 iib2 it turns out that Black has managed to drop two connected passed pawns on the queenside behind the enemy lines, so to speak. These may well intimidate a pessimistically in- clined player of the white pieces to a disastrous degree, yet the optimistically inclined will look at his mass of central pawns and judge the posi- tion quite differently. Whoever wants to play this line (with either colour) will need a good deal of theoretical knowledge or a lot of self- confidence and preferably both.
3...O6/ 3...>e7
3 ... (D)
This simple and natural developing move al- ready constituted the main line of the Queen's Gambit Declined as far back as the 19th century and this situation has never really changed. A subtle modern variation on it is 3...jie7. This move is intended to limit the opponent's op- tions. If White continues 4 Nf3 then Black will simply play 4...<Rjf6 and return to the main lines. By preventing Ag5, if only for one move, Black hopes to take the sting out of the Ex- change Variation. It is precisely here, however, that the critical test for 3...jLe7 lies, for While can return the favour by playing 4 cxd5 exd5 5 .Nf4. Because Black has already put his bishop on e7, the natural reply 5...jLd6 is now slightly less attractive (though it is still not bad and ac- tually played quite often) which means that Black is also limited in his choices. He will want to develop his queen's bishop to f5 but first 5...c6 6 e3 Bf5 7 g4 and secondly 5...?3f6 6 e3 -K£_f5 7 Qb3 need to be properly evaluated.
QUEEN'S GAMBIT DECLINED 15

These lines are pretty sharp, but the amount of theory involved is moderate compared to the 'regular' Exchange Variation. Three main lines have developed from this position. The oldest and most straightforward one is 4 jLg5, then there is the flexible 4 Nf3 and finally we have 4 cxd5, the Exchange Variation.
3... f6 4 i.g5
4 _tg5 Many different variations have evolved from this position, especially in the first decades of the 20th century, when the Queen's Gambit De- clined reigned supreme in the world of chess openings. Most of these lines have now been practically forgotten. Black has, for instance, the possibility 4...c5 5 cxd5 cxd4, called the Dutch Gambit (or the Dutch-Peruvian Gambit, due to the Peruvian player Canal's alternative idea 5...Rb6). This was still moderately popular as late as the 1950s, but has now been reduced to a footnote. Then there is the older still Cambridge Springs Variation, which is less risky and fairly popular to this day. It can be reached ci- ther by playing 4... bd7 5 c3 c6 6 Nf3 Ra5 (D) or by 4...c6 5 e3 Nbd7 6 <?Jf3 Qa5. Black unpins his king's knight and prepares the aggres- sive moves ...Ji.b4 and both of which should not be underestimated. White's most cautious reply is 7 5rid2, where- upon Black has two options: 7...dxc4 more or less forces the exchange 8 jLxf6 $lxf6 after which many players, satisfied with this achieve- ment, will be happy to withdraw' their queen (9 Nxc4 Qc7), and 7...i.b4 8 Qc2 O-O 9 i.c2 and now either 9...c5 or 9...e5, continuing the at- tack. A sharper reply is 7 cxd5 <Nxd5 (with the black queen on a5. 7...exd5 would produce an inferior version of the Exchange Variation) 8 Qd2. White is prepared to sacrifice the pawn that will be lost after 8... .b4 9 Bel <?Y7b6 (fol- lowed by 10...4)a4) in order to take over the initiative. This approach is perhaps the most feared nowadays although its consequences are far from clear. Black also has 8... 7b6, imme- diately bringing the second knight into the as- sault on c3, when White also tends to sacrifice a pawn, by 9 Jcd3 Nxc3 10 bxc3 <S d5 1 1 O-O. In practice many players avoid the Cam- bridge Springs by transposing to the Exchange Variation with cxd5 on move 5 or 6. All other variations at Black's disposal start with... 4 ... Ae7 Just like 3...£rf6, this is a solid and natural move. Black is not in a hurry to try to take over the initiative, and simply develops his pieces instead.
5 e3 O-O
6 21f3 (D) This is the starting point for all variations which are based on 4...Ae7. In the course of well over a century the following can be said to have evolved as the main lines: 6...?Abd7,
6...h6 7 ,Nh4 Ne4. 6...h6 7 ±h4 b6 and 6...h6
7 ±xf6.
16 FUNDAMENTAL CHESS OPENINGS
Both these variations are old and respectable and still quite fashionable, but the real main line of the Queen's Gambit Declined is now
6...h6 7 Bh4 b6 (D), the Tartakower Varia-
tion. The oldest of these is 6...Nbd7. After White's most common reply 7 Scl Black may choose
7...c6 8 Jid3 dxc4 9 Jlxc4 Nd5, the Capa-
blanca Variation. Here we touch upon some of the bedrock theory of the Queen's Gambit De- clined. It has remained virtually unchanged since the 1920s yet it is still alive and very in- teresting. The point is that after the plausible 10 Jtxe7 Qxe7 1 1 O-O Nxc3 12 2xc3 Black contin- ues 12...c5, when he has reached a very accept- able position without any weaknesses. White has tried just about everything to hold on to at least a minimum of initiative. One option is the forcing 13 dxe5 9\xe5 14 Nxc5 Qxe5 15 f4, which has been worked out very deeply. The- ory's present favourite, however, seems to be
13 Rc2 exd4 1 4 exd4.
Very closely related to the Capablanca Varia- tion is 6...h6 7 _4'.h4 64, the Lasker Variation. Here too Black aims at a fairly uncomplicated middlegame by exchanging some minor pieces. In some cases the similarities with Capablanca's idea are astonishing; for instance, after 8 jLxe7 Rxe7 9 gel c6 10 Jld3 Nxc3 1 1 Hxc3 dxc4 12 _sLxc4 4bd7 13 O-O e5 the only difference from the line given above is that Black's pawn is on h6 instead of h7. A good alternative plan is 13...b6. Perhaps the most principled approach is to play 9 cxd5 (instead of 9 2c 1 ), forcing the exchange on c3. After 9...Nxc3 10 bxc3 cxd.5 White has a very sound strategy in 1 1 'B'bS followed by c4 gaining a nice central pawn-majority. Black's reasons for allowing this are the open lines, which allow him an easy and active develop- ment of his pieces. This gives rise to much more complex posi- tions than both the Capablanca and the Lasker Variation have to offer while retaining about the same degree of reliability, a very fortunate combination of characteristics which makes the Tartakower very attractive indeed. In fact there is hardly a world-class player nowadays who has never played it. White has tried a great number of ideas to gain at least a minimal opening advantage, of- ten extremely subtle and sometimes involving a clever move-order to execute a standard plan in a new form. Basically White has three different plans at his disposal. The first is to leave Black in peace and to concentrate instead on developing as ac- tively as possible. This attitude may result in a variation like 8 Nd3 Nb7 9 O-O €ibd7 10 Be2 c5 1 1 gfd 1 . The tension in the centre may be re- solved at any moment, but how? This strategy is intrinsically sound but it does require some accuracy and good positional skills in order to be really effective. The second plan is to do precisely the oppo- site: White fixes the central pawn-formation im- mediately by playing 8 cxd5. This was the main line of the Tartakower until about 1970, but when it became increasingly clear that 8...Q>xd5
9 Jkxe7 Qxe7 10 ?\xd5 cxd5 is entirely playable
QUEEN'S GAMBIT DECLINED 17
for Black, mainly because of the discovery that after 1 1 Scl the somewhat surprising 1 1 ...jLe6 is much stronger than 1 l...Bb7, its popularity dwindled. 1 1...Jle6 leaves Black free to use the open b-file after 12 Be2 c5 13 dxc5 bxc5 14 O-O (Ld? for his rooks. Chances are considered equal here. The third plan (and the most popular one nowadays), is actually a refinement of the sec- ond. White waits for 8...Ab7 to be played (this can be done in numerous ways, the most com- mon ones being 8 3ld3. 8 Ne2. 8 Scl and 8 Qb3), he then exchanges bishop for knight on f6 and only then does he take on d5. In this type of middlegame it is much more difficult for Black to free his position by means of ...c5 and if he does not achieve this pawn-break he runs the risk of ending up in a slightly passive, if still fairly solid position. Naturally by giving up the bishop-pair White does take a certain amount of long-term positional risk, so this strategy, popular though it is. does require a steady hand. The reader may have noticed that both the Lasker and the Tartakower Variation are given here as starting with 6...h6, This is played sim- ply because in many of the resulting positions ...h6 turns out to be a useful move for Black. Inevitably the attempt to 'punish' Black for (his insertion by not retreating the bishop and going for 7 Bxf6 instead has also been investi- gated. Very similar to the above-mentioned third plan against the Tartakower, White gives up the bishop-pair in order to make it more dif- ficult for Black to gel ...c5 in. At the same time a ...b6 set-up (for instance 7..Bxf6 8 Scl b6) is discouraged because White will then normally be just a tempo ahead of a regular Tartakower. This means that Black will have to think of other methods of tackling the opening prob- lems. Pour main lines have been developed, all based on White's choice of move after 7...3Lxf6
(D).
These lines are very subtle and need a good deal of positional understanding, but basically they all fit into the simple schedule: White chooses a move to make ...c5 as unattractive as possible, then Black reacts in such a way as to demonstrate that While has made the wrong choice. After 8 Scl. an enormously popular move around 1 985, 8...c6 9 Nd3 2)d7 10 O-O dxc4 11 jLxc4 e5 is the main line. On 8 Rc2. intended to make castling queen- side possible, Black turns out to be able to play the much longed-for 8...c5 anyway, mainly be- cause of the fearless pawn sacrifice 9 dxc5 5)c61. Subtly different from this, 8 Qd2, also with a view to castling queenside, is met by 8...dxc4 9 Jlxc4 Nd7 with 10...c5 to follow. Perhaps White's most forceful move (though not necessarily the strongest!) is 8 'b3, attack- ing Black's pawn on d5. In that case Black will have to look for a specific way to take advan- tage of the exposed position of the white queen:
8...c6 9 Sdl Nd7 10 l.d3 and now 10..>b6,
10...a5 and 10...flb8 (intending ll...b5) have
all been played.
3...Nf6 4 f3
4 2>f3 (D) This position very often occurs via 1 d4 4bf6
2 c4 e6 ("A Nimzo-Indian - 3 ?3c3 -fi.b4 - per-

3...Ji.b4+.") 3...d5 ("Well, now that you have
pul your knight on f3 I think I prefer a Queen's Gambit Declined.'') 4 <2k3. Because 4 < Bf3 applies less direct pressure on Black's central position than 4 Jtg5, Black now has a very large choice. The main lines are
4... .e7, 4...Nbd7. 4...c5, 4..Bb4 and 4...dxc4,
4...c6 is also important but this is one of several
18 FUNDAMENTAL CHESS OPENINGS
just that little bit less attractive (from Black's point of view) than with a white bishop on g5. On the other hand Black now has a move that is simply bad with a bishop on g5, but is entirely feasible after 5 Jlf4. 6 ... c5 Thus it is only natural that this has become the main line. With White's bishop on f4 in- stead of g5. Black's d5-pawn is safe. 7 dxcS kxcS (D) move-orders to reach the Semi-Slav, and will be dealt with in the next chapter.

4 ... Ne7 Black's most classical move. Now 5 Ag5 will take us back to the 4 Jig5 lines, but White has an important alternative which rose to great prominence in the 1990s.
5 Nf4 (D)
On the face of it, this move is less aggressive than 5 Jtg5, but it has the great advantage of not overly encouraging standard simplifying ma- noeuvres like ...<2>e4. White now has a choice of two fundamen- tally different plans. The first is to keep the po- sition simple by exchanging on d5. The main line runs 8 cxd5 5)xd5 9 *21x45 exd5 and now both 10 a3 and 10 Ji.d3 have been played. 10 a3 stops Black from playing 10...Ji.b4+. After something like 10...Nc6 11 Ji.d3 Nb6 12 O-O Jlg4 Black has developed his pieces satisfacto- rily, but White may still hope to besiege the iso- lated d-pawn. 10 -d3 Nb4+ pursues the same strategy more fanatically, ignoring the some- what precarious position of the white king and hoping to take advantage of the now rather loosely placed bishop on b4. The other and far more popular plan is not to worry about a possible ...dxc4. play 8 a3 or 8 W'2. develop the queenside and increase the pressure on d5 later on. A critical position arises after 8 a3 ,c6 9 Qc2 Ra5 (D). Black's last move tlireatens ...•2Be4 and forces White to react.

QUEEN'S GAMBIT DECLINED 19
flexible option which can be played with several ideas in mind. To begin with, it may be used as an anti-5 .Nf4 weapon since on 5 Bf4 Black now has the excellent reply 5...dxc4. The white bishop finds itself somewhat awkwardly placed after both 6 e4 Ji.b4 and 6 e3 Nd5, so this is usually avoided. Against 5 Ng5 Black has a choice between transposing to the 4 Xg5 main lines by playing
5...Ae7 or 5...h6 6 Bh4 Jke7 (although he has
of course committed himself to a ...Cibd7 line), the Ragozin Variation by 5... ,b4 (see page 21 ) or the Cambridge Springs by 5...c6 6 e3 Qa5 (seepage 15). The critical test for 4...Nbd7 is 5 cxd5 exd5
6 Nf4. Again, as in the variation 3...Ae7 (see
page 14), because there is a drawback to the natural reply ...i.d6 (in this case of course
6...Ju.d6 7 Bxd6 cxd6 would be awkward) White
is hoping to achieve a favourable version of the Exchange Variation. The whole of the 4,..Nbd7 line, although it has been known for quite some time, has some- how managed to stay clear of the theoretical steamrollers. This makes it an interesting choice for those who know their way about in the Queen's Gambit and can hope to lure their op- ponents into unknown territory. the centre with 1 l...e5 12 ,2.g5 d4. This varia- tion was thoroughly examined and considered acceptable for both sides. Then, in 1988, 10 O-O-O was introduced and this became extremely popular almost over- night. After 10...Jle7 both the ferocious at- tacking moves 1 1 g4 and 11 h4 and the more subtle 11 Nd2 and 1 1 &bl all turned out to be very dangerous for Black. It took a few years, but by now Black has managed to work out good defensive lines against all four of these moves and the Queen's Gambit Declined is back from the Intensive Care Unit, but it was mighty close!
3...06 4 03 Od7
4 ... Nbd7 (D)
3...06 4 03 c5
4 ... c5 This is called the Semi-Tarrasch Variation, and it indeed bears a close superficial relation- ship with the line 3...c5. However, the name is at odds with the fact that Tarrasch was attracted to his opening, the Tarrasch Defence, by the point that Black is going to play ...exd5 if White ever takes on d5, while in the variation that we are discussing here. Black's aim is to avoid an isolated queen's pawn. Hardly a strategy that Tarrasch would have approved of, let alone given his name to! But of course chess opening nomenclature is not always logical and this is really a nice illustration of the fact. However, the strategic idea behind the move
4...c5 is perfectly logical and that is what counts.
Black attacks the white central formation in a very straightforward way. This move has not yet established itself suffi- ciently to get a name, but it is a sound and - I' U/VlzAiriwir J/llt l/l I-/U/VUJ consider sufficient compensation for the mate- rial deficit. Nevertheless most people avoid this by developing their king's bishop in a slightly less active way. namely 9 jLe2. avoiding the knight fork on b4. Also 8 Bd2 (instead of 8 Rc2) is often played. The solid option is 6 g3 (D). This is the idea. The whole variation has ac- tually more in common with a Griinfeld De- fence than with the Tarrasch. Black challenges his opponent to occupy the centre by playing 6 e4. Such an aggressive attitude is not to every- one's taste, however, and the rather more re- served options 6 e3 and 6 g3 have also grown into proper variations. After 6 e4 ?)xc3 7 bxc3 cxd4 8 cxd4 Ab4+ 9 Bd2 Bxd2+ 10 Rxd2 O-O Black has developed very nicely and it is not clear how strong White's central position really is. The main line goes 1 1 Nc4 Nc6 12 O-O b6 followed by 13..J.b7. The position seems to be asking for a d5 break- through, but its consequences are far from clear. A good variation for players with strong nerves! Though outwardly less aggressive. 6 e3 also offers White some attacking prospects, but of a different nature. In fact he is inviting Black to play 6...cxd4. when 7 exd4 (D) now gives White an isolated queen's pawn with all the (latent) at- tacking chances on the kingside that go with it. Theory recognizes two main lines here. One is easy development: 7... .e7 8 jkd3 (or 8 Bc4)

10...Bf6. The other is more aggressive and

White follows a completely different strat- egy here. Instead of trying to establish some son of central dominance, he aims for a symmet- rical position with a tiny lead in development and some pressure against b7.

6...h6 forces White to make a decision.
Should he take on f6 or is 7 Bh4 the stronger move? The latter invites the sharp response
7...g5 8 J.g3 £te4, threatening 9...Q>xc3 as well
as 9...h5. White must deal firmly with this. The pawn sacrifice 9 <2)d2! <2Bxc3 10 bxc3 jLxc3 1 1 2c 1 offers good attacking prospects (especially because 1 l...Nxd4? fails to 12 Ra4+ Sc6 13 fixc6), but exactly how good remains unclear. What is clear is that in practice most players prefer 7 J_xf6, leading to a much more sedate middlegame. The main line goes 7...Qxf6 8 Ra4+ <2k6 9 e3 O-O 10 Ne2 ,Bc6 11 O-O. In com- parison with the Exchange Variation, Black's pieces arc rather scattered all over the board so it may look as if White's opening play has been successful, yet a Ragozin expert usually man- ages to recoordinate them fairly quickly.
3...Nf6 4 2rf3 dxc4
4 ... dxc4 This is one of the youngest variations of the Queen's Gambit Declined. It was hardly ever played before the 1990s. Black immediately forces his opponent to make a fundamental de- cision. He can win back the pawn very easily with 5 e3 or 5 Qa4+ but both these moves trans- pose to another opening where White has then 'missed' a number of options. 5 e3 c5 6 ii_xc4 a6 is a Queen's Gambit Accepted and 5 'S'a4+ c6 6 Rxc4 b5 is a variation of the Semi-Slav. Though neither of these lines is bad for White, he may not like the choice of variation that has been forced on him. The more principled continuation is:
5 e4 ±b4
6 JlgS c5 (D)
This is called the Vienna Variation, a line that enjoyed a certain popularity in the 1930s, was completely forgotten for half a century but came back with a vengeance in 1987, when it was rejuvenated and analysed very deeply. It is a provocative way to handle the opening be- cause at first sight White appears to have a great number of very attractive possibilities. Black's position turns out to be remarkably resilient. Now there are two main lines for Black,
6../zhbd7 and 6...h6,
Against 6...Nbd7, 7 c3 c5 8 .d3 constitutes White's most natural development. Black then lashes out on the queenside with 8...Ra5 9 Qc2 c4. This leads, after 10 Af5 O-O 1 1 O-O 2e8, to a difficult position. White's ideal plan would be to play e4, preferably after Q>d2 and f.3, but prac- tice has shown that this is hard to achieve against an opponent who knows what he is doing. Still, this is White's most principled approach. Very often, however, White avoids this type of middlegame altogether by playing 7 Sc 1 or 7 Qc2. White plans to radically stop ...c5-c4 by taking on c5 should Black play ...c5. For in- stance, after 7 Qc2 c5 8 dxc5 Ra5 9 .d2! the game assumes a totally different character from the 7 e3 line. Though Black is certainly not
22 FUNDAMENTAL CHESS OPENINGS
By taking on d5. White fixes the central pawn-formation and avoids the myriad varia- tions that we have Looked at on the previous pages. The strategic situation is now clear. Yet even here a great variety of plans and schemes of development have been tried and investi- gated, both for White and for Black. 4 ... cxd5(D) Analogous to the Semi-Tarrasch, 4...<5'Bxd5 is sometimes played to avoid the typical Exchange Variation pawn- structure. A direct transposi- tion is possible; e.g., 5 e4 xcS 6 bxc3 c5 7 £rf3 (page 20), but White may deviate with 7 a3!. preventing the simplifying check on b4.
W
however, and White's straightforward aggres- sion may also create a few weaknesses in his own camp. At any rate it is a real tactician's variation. The first move to catch the eye is 7 e5. This was met in the 1930s by 7...cxd4, whereupon 8 Ra4+ 21c6 9 O-O-O ±d7 10 21e4 ii.c7 1 1 exf6 gxf6 leads to a highly complicated position where Black seems to have sufficient compen- sation for the sacrificed piece. The modem re- joinder to 7 e5 is 7...h6 8 exf6 hxg5 9 fxg7 fig8. This too has held up reasonably well in prac- tice. Then there is the alternative 7 Ji.xc4, seem- ingly simple and strong. White makes no im- mediate attempt to crush his opponent and instead relies on his lead in development to give him the initiative. Yet here too, things have turned out to be not that simple. The critical po- sition arises after 7...cxd4 8 I2)xd4 Nxc3+ 9 bxc3 Qa5. when White has tried 10 Nb5, 10 Nxf6 Qxc3+ 1 1 Qfl (the idea being to meet 1 l...Qxc4+ 124gl gxf6?with 13Scl),andl0 Jlb5+. Years of intensive research have not produced a clear main line.
3."Nf6 4 cxd5
4 cxdS This is the Exchange Variation or, perhaps more accurately, the most important version of it. White can take on d5 in many positions of the Queen's Gambit Declined. By choosing this particular move-order, however, he optimizes the latent advantages of this exchange.
5 Ng5
The best move and one of the reasons why this particular move-order constitutes the most accurate way of playing the Exchange Varia- tion. If White plays an early Qf3 he is normally unable to stop Black from playing ...Af5, which practically solves all development problems Black may have in this line. For instance in the position after 5 Nf3 c6, which often arises from the Semi-Slav (1 d4 d5 2 c4 c6 3 Nf3 2>f6 4 Nc3 e6 and now 5 cxd5 exd5), Black's opening problems are nowhere near to what he is facing in the main line: 6 .Ng5 &.C1 (an immediate
6..Jlf5 is also possible but leads to a more
complicated middlegame after the disruptive 7 Rb3) and now 7 e3 Af5 or 7 Rc2 g6! 8 e.3 Nf5. 5 ... c6 (D) The alternative 5...Be7 is likely to transpose after a few moves, but the text offers Black one or two interesting extras.

7 e3 Nbd7
8 ±d3 O-O This has been the main line for ages, but an important alternative has recently come to the fore which is probably just as good: 8...?3h5. Black deflates the tension on the kingside even before White has shown any signs of aggression there. After 9 Jlxc7 Qxe7 and now, for instance, 10 <23ge2 Black continues 10...g6, intending ...<?3g7, ...£3b6 and ...Bf5. He also retains the op- tion of castling either side, the idea being to wait for White to castle and then go the same way. It is difficult to say whether this is better than
8...O-O, but there is certainly far less theory to
be studied. After 8...O-O White has to choose a plan. For most players this will be a matter of taste be- cause the following variations differ consider- ably in their respective characters. The classical method is to play 9 Nf3 and, after Black's standard reply 9...Se8, simply to castle kingside: 10 O-O (D). White then has several ways to implement the typical plan of a minority attack on the queen- side, the most straightforward being 10...<23f8 11 fiabl followed by b4-b5xc6. White creates a weakness in Black's pawn-structure (if all goes according to plan there will be a loose pawn ei- ther on c6 or on d5) which will be the object of further attacks. Black may try to stop this plan but he will eventually have to look for coun- terplay on the kingside. A possible continua- tion is ll...a5 12 a3 <22>g6 13 b4 axb4 14 axb4 <2364. Play may look a little slow in this line but it can actually become rather violent in the middlegame, especially when Black gets going on the kingside. This is much more obvious if W'hite decides to castle queenside, 10 O-O-O. Now it will be White who attacks on the kingside (10...?3f8 11 h3 to be followed by g4). The same plan is often executed in a slightly different version, starting with 9 ?3ge2 (D). After 9...Se8 10 O-O-O the general outlook is the same: White attacks on the kingside with
24 FUNDAMENTAL CHESS OPENINGS
h3, g4 and perhaps <2jg3-f5, while Black Hies his luck on the queenside. Both 10...a5 fol- lowed by ...b5 and ...a4 and 10...4bf8 followed by ...Jl.e6, ...2c8 and ...c5 have been played. In the late 1980s, a plan became popular which combines the development of White's king's knight to e2 with castling kingside: 10 O-O. Of course this still allows White the more traditional plan of a minority attack on the queenside, but the modem idea is to continue
10...<2hf8 1 1 f3 intending a frontal attack in the
centre with e4. Thanks to some beautiful games by Kasparov, this line has become extremely popular. Play is very different from the more traditional Exchange Variation lines discussed above. White attacks in the centre and Black will have to think of a completely new strategy to adapt to the new situation. One important motif is the counter-thrust ...c5. Some typical problems are illustrated by the following sam- ple line: H...jLe6 12 Sael (it is still an open question whether this rook should go to d 1 or el) 12...&6d7 13 .f4 (and here it is the choice between keeping the bishops on the board or not which leaves theoreticians baffled) 13...Sc8 and after 14 e4 dxe4 15 fxe4 c5! 16 d5 c4 17 dxe6 'Sixeb Black regains the sacrificed piece and stands well. White should prepare e4 fur- ther by playing 14 &hl. If Black then goes
14...c5 anyway, White takes on c5 and plays
against the isolated d-pawn. We have now examined all major options for White of tackling the Queen's Gambit Declined with one exception. Technically speaking this is an independent opening which may arise in many different ways. Still, because the basic central formation is the one from the Queen's Gambit Declined, it seems to me that the best place for discussing this opening is in the pres- ent chapter. We are talking about the Catalan Opening, in which White fianchettoes his king's bishop.
3 The Catalan
3 Nf3
This is the most popular way of introducing the Catalan, although an immediate 3 g3 is also not bad. On the other hand 3 c3 and onl) now 4 g3 is considered less accurate becaust the possibility of playing l?)bd2 is very usefu in the Catalan, so it seems rather a pity to give i away so early. 3 ... f6
4 g3 (D)
This, the basic position of the Catalan, i: reached via many roads. Perhaps the most com mon one is 1 d4 4t)f6 2 c4 e6 3 g3 d5 4 <2)f3 G fLg2 is equally sound and is likely to transpose after just a few more moves). The fianchetto (meaning 'flank' develop ment, i.e. to g2 rather than somewhere on the fl-a6 diagonal) development of the king': bishop is not intended to take immediate actior in the centre nor is White aiming at any particu lar fixed pawn-formation. Il is chosen with th< long-term strategic goal of putting pressure ot the long hl-a8 diagonal. This pressure is mos likely to be felt when Black plays ...c5 or whei he takes on c4 at some point. In the latter cast White will in many cases regain the pawn witl Ra4+, but sometimes a gambit will also be at interesting option. White then allows his oppo nent to keep the pawn on c4, hoping to us< whatever means Black employs to protect hi. booty to his own advantage. This could worl along the lines of: Black plays ...b5 to protec his pawn on c4. White attacks b5 with a4. Blacl covers b5 with ...c6, White intensifies the pres sure with 5)e5, Black blocks the h 1-a8 diagona with ...4Bd5, White attacks in the centre with e and possibly d5.
QUEEN'S GAMBIT DECLINED 25
Black's options against the Catalan can roughly be divided in three variations: notwith- standing the above he may try 4...c5 or 4...dxc4, because these moves are part of the fundamen- tally sound strategy of undermining White's central position no matter what reason White may have for allowing them. 4...c5 will nor- mally transpose to a Tarrasch Defence after 5 cxd5 exd5, whereas 4...dxc4 has a great num- ber of subvariations that will be examined be- low. The third option is simply to continue development: 4...Ae7, 3 03 06 4 g3 dxc4 4 ... dxc4 (D) on the same idea. Black delays the weakening ...b5 until White has castled, or- more cautious still - he may prefer (6 O-O) 6...Nc6, when per- haps ...b5 won't even be necessary.
5...Nc6 is often played with the same idea in
mind. Now after 6 O-O Sb8 Black has simply economized on ...a6 which is very nice, but there is also a disadvantage. If White plays 6 Qa4, Black is neither in a position to reply ...b5 nor can he achieve the freeing ...c5 very easily.
5...c5 is based on a totally different view of
the situation. Black is not concerned with keep- ing his pawn on c4 at all; he is concerned with attacking White's last remaining stronghold in the centre: the pawn on d4. After 6 O-O ?)c6 White has to play very aggressively in order to keep his chances of an opening advantage alive. Critical are 7 Qa4 with the idea of 7...cxd4 8 Nxd4! Rxd4 9 Axc6+, and the pawn sacrifice 7Ne5.
5....6.7 prevents 6 Qa4(+) and aims at com-
pleting this bishop's development with 6...jLc6. The alert reaction 6 Oe5 is probably critical. 3 03 06 4 g3 ,Ne7 4 ... Ne7 Priority is given to completing development of the kingside. Naturally, taking on c4 remains an option. 5 jLg2 O-O
6 O-O (D)
Black now faces the same choice again.
6...dxc4, 6...c5 or 6...something else: which is
best? This is called the Open Catalan. White can win back his pawn by playing 5 Qa4+. Black then has 5...Nbd7 6 Qxc4 a6 preparing to meet 7 i.g2 with 7...b5 8 Rc2 Ab7. By putting his bishop on b7 Black neutralizes any pressure the bishop on g2 may exert. Now all he needs to achieve full equality is to play ...4)bd7 and ...c5. To prevent this rather straightforward scheme from happening, White usually prefers a more pointed move:
5 Ag2 (D)
In this position Black must lay his cards on the table. Those who feel like challenging the validity of White's last move will consider
5...b5. Black walks into the scenario which I
have outlined above, but if he is aware of the dangers awaiting him, this is a valid option.
5...a6 is a slightly more cautious move, based
26 FUNDAMENTAL CHESS OPENINGS
W
6...c5 is again very likely to transpose to a
Tarrasch after 7 cxd5 exd5. There is also the Closed Catalan, where Black develops his queenside without either taking on c4 or playing ...c5. This idea may be pursued with either 6...Nbd7 or 6...c6, The two moves often transpose. An important scheme of development is to play ...b6 with an eye to devel- oping the queen's bishop to b7 or a6 depending on where While puts his queen's knight (<21c3 leaves c4 undefended, which makes ... ,a6 an attractive option). After Black completes his development (for instance ...Ab7, ...Nbd7 and ...2c8) the liberating ...c5 comes into view again. Another idea is to play ...c6 followed by ...b5. White's main plan is to open the centre by playing e4 at some point. The Open Catalan approach is still avail- able, although taking on c4 now is very differ- ent from taking on c4 two moves ago. In fact
6...dxc4 is one of the most popular variations
of meeting the Catalan. The idea is to counter the plausible 7 Rc2 with 7,..a6. This leads, af- ter 8 Qxc4 b5 9 Rc2 i.b7 (N). to a type of po- sition that we have already encountered in the
4...dxc4 5 Qa4+ variation.
Again Black is aiming at completing the de- velopment of his quecnside by playing ...Nbd7 and ...c5. White has tried to prevent this or at least to make it as unattractive as possible in numerous ways, the most direct being 10 Af4 and 10 .Nd2 ?)bd7 1 1 Ba5. Still, hundreds of games at the highest level have shown that White must be a supremely good positional player to squeeze any advantage from this line. Many players consider this sufficient reason for preferring the more robust 8 a4. At the price of a certain loss of flexibility in his queenside pawn- formation, White stops ...b5 altogether. Black now has to look elsewhere for a way to develop his queen's bishop. The most popular solution is
8...i.d7, which is very solid. 9 Rxc4 J-c6 leaves
Black with a little less space but well developed and 9 *2he5 Qc6 has also held up well in practice. The same can be said about 7 ?)e5. The sur- prising reply 7...>2Bc6 has taken the sting out of this seemingly very logical move. In a very un- orthodox way Black gets some nice open files and diagonals for his pieces, both after 8 Nxc6 bxc6 9 Bxc6 2b8 and after 8 Jlxc6 bxc6 9 Nxc6 Re8. 7 4Bc3 is the sharpest approach. White makes no attempt whatsoever to get his pawn back and simply intends to play 8 e4. This has been in- vestigated far less deeply than the more cau- tious 7 c2 and 7 $Se5.

Queen's Gambit Declined) or he must be pre- pared to risk some fairly sharp variations where he may have to sacrifice a pawn. The most radical way of eliminating ...dxc4 is 3 cxdS, the Exchange Variation, yet the main lines of the Slav are to be reached with either 3 -?'f3 or 3 <2Bc3. These two 'natural de- veloping moves' will often transpose, but of course there are a few important differences. Exchange Variation 3 cxdS cxdS (D) Though not as old as the Queen's Gainbit Declined, the Slav has an excellent record of service and is considered a classical opening. It first became popular when it was extensively tested in the World Championship matches be- tween Alekhine and Euwe in 1935 and 1937, with both players adopting it in turn. Since then it has always remained one of the most impor- tant 1 d4 openings with new variations being developed and refined all the time. As in the Queen's Gambit Declined Black maintains a firm grip on d5, but the difference is an important one: he keeps the c8-h3 diagonal open for his queen's bishop where it can be ag- gressively developed to f5 or g4. Another point of 2...c6 is that now the threat of taking on c4 looms much larger over White's position than after 2...e6 since a black pawn on c4 can now be immediately protected by a pawn on b5 (,..b5) which will itself be covered in advance by the pawn on c6. In fact 2...c6 forces White to take a fundamental decision: in comparison with 2...e6 he will either have to be more reticent in his nat- ural development (moves like W3, Qc3 and jLf4 or Bg5 are less self-evident than in the One of the great tragedies of the Slav Ex- change Variation is that its reputation has been soiled in the past by the fact that is has been the most popular line for pre-arranged draws in tournament games. Countless games have been 'played' along the lines of 4 <5)c3 ftc6 5 £jf3 2Bf6 6 Nf4 Nf5 7 e3 e6 8 i.d3 Nxd3 9 'S'xdS Nd6 10 .xd6 Rxd6 1 1 O-O O-O, followed by a random num- ber of uninteresting moves and a draw before move twenty. And yet the exchange on d5 is a perfectly le- gitimate and highly serious way of playing, a strategy that has been successfully employed

by great champions like Botvinnik, Portisch and Kasparov! It is based on the assumption that it is precisely in a symmetrical position that the advantage of having the first move can be the most dangerous.
4 Nc3 Nf6
A somewhat puzzling feature of the Ex- change Variation is that its theory does not really start before the position shown in the next diagram. In what way this position is best reached, however, is a sadly neglected ques- tion. So much is certain that 4.,.£jf6 is played far more often than 4...Qc6 (with some aggressive ideas like 5 jLf4 c5'?), yet the only move that could possibly prove the latter wrong or at least inaccurate is 5 e4 and almost nothing is known about this! Since5...dxe4 6d5 looks rather dan- gerous, 5...'2Bf6 seems a sensible reply. This produces a position from the Panov Attack of the Caro-Kann (see page 379) if White contin- ues 6 exd5 <2)xd5 7 <2Bf3, but 6 e5 e4 7 Ad3. for instance, leads us into totally unknown ter- ritory. We should also note that 4...e5I? transposes to a line of the Winawer Counter-Gambit (see page 38) and so totally changes the strategic picture. White can of course avoid this possibil- ity by playing 4 5)f3, or by inserting 3 Nf3 Nf6 before exchanging on d5. 5 ?)f3 At this point theory begins to be interested, if only vaguely. 5 €)f3 and 5 Nf4 are about equally popular with the latter move being con- sidered slightly more flexible. Still, after 5 Af4 £sc6 6 e3 the general picture is almost the same as after 5 <2)f3 f)c6 6 Jcf4: 6...jlf5 and 6...e6 are the traditional moves and 6...a6 the cheek}' newcomer. 5 ... 43c6
6 Nf4 (D)
This is the most important point of departure for the Slav Exchange Variation. Black now has four moves, all giving the game a decided fla- vour of its own.
6...Bf5 is the most traditional option, pre-
serving the symmetry and challenging White to show what his 'advantage' is worth. For this purpose 7 e3 c6 8 Bb5 is the preferred choice. White is threatening 9 Ne5 and is hoping at least to saddle his opponent with a backward c-pawn after a future .xc6 bxc6. Black has to concede some ground here and 8...4f)d7 is gen- erally looked upon as the best defence. The main line then runs 9 Qa4 Hc8 10 O-O a6 11 A,xc6 Bxc6 12 gfcl, when White has a tiny lead in development. However, it is very diffi- cult to turn this into a more tangible advantage. Another long-standing main line is 6...e6, which is usually looked upon as perhaps a little bit on the passive side but very reliable. After 7 e3 Xd6 (7...Jce7 is also a good move) White can simply take on d6 or he can keep a little more tension in the position by playing 8 Jlg3. This is aimed at making castling kingside less attractive for Black; e.g., 8...()-() 9 Jid3 fol- lowed by 10 €)e5 could become troublesome. A solid alternative is 8... .xg3 9 hxg3 Qd6, de- laying castling and stopping White from play- ing Ne5. Indeed Black could now take the initiative in the centre himself by playing ...e5 at some point. Of far more recent origin is the attempt to pre-empt any possible aggression by White on the queenside by playing 6...a6 (D). This has an added advantage in that it retains the possibility of ...Bg4, which would now be an excellent reply if White were to continue 7 e3. The immediate 6...Bg4 has a bad reputation because of 7 Q)e5, but if White does not have this reply (as after 6...a6 7 e3 J(.g4), this active development of the queen's bishop is perfectly playable. In fact this is why many players meet
6...a6 with 7 Scl instead of 7 e3. Only if Black
SLAV AND SEMI-SLAV 29
With this move we are entering main-line territory. White docs not resolve the central tension and boldly develops a knight without being worried about a possible ...dxc4. It is in- teresting that this attitude was practically taken for granted for a very long period of time and was only brought up for discussion in the 1990s, when all of a sudden 3...dxc4 came to be taken very seriously indeed. Just like the Noteboom Variation (3...e6 4 Nc3 dxc4; see page 13) Black aims for a sharp battle based on a very asymmetrical pawn-formation. Similar to the Noteboom, the main line runs 4 e3 b5 5 a4 e6 6 axb5 cxb5 7 b3 Nb4-f- 8 Nd2 Axd2+ 9 bxd2 a5 10 bxc4 b4. Black has 'saddled' his oppo- nent with a strong pawn-centre while creating two dangerous-looking passed pawns for him- self on the queenside. This has become ac- cepted theory in recent years, although a name has not yet been given to this new branch of the Slav. Nevertheless the traditional move firmly re- mains in place: 3 ... Nf6 Whi te now has a choice of 4 cxdS, going for the Exchange Variation after all, 4 e3, which is cautious and not bad but considered relatively easy for Black after 4... .f5 (while 4...a6 is also popular), or he may choose to ignore the threat of taking on c4 again by playing the most natu- ral developing move: 4 <5)c3 (D) •.hen 'commits' himself with 7...jLf5, is 8 e3 entured. In practice, however. Black has expe- rienced few difficulties in this line. Having a pawn on a6 has turned out to be simply quite useful. This ...a6 variation is especially impor- tant since those who play ...a6 in the standard Slav lines are committed to this line if White exchanges on d5 in a line like 3 <5)f3 Nf6 4 5te3 a6 5 cxd5 cxd5. Equally youthful and perhaps even more amazing is the bold sally 6..."2Be4. Black breaks the symmetry and intends to continue 7 e.3 21xc3 8 bxc3 g6. This variation contains an ele- ment of risk but at least White must now really fight for the initiative and it therefore seems a very suitable choice against an opponent who had been looking forward to an easy draw. 3 f3
3 Nf3 (D)
Traditionally, theory of the Slav splits up at this point into two main lines.
30 FUNDAMENTAL CHESS OPENINGS
Immediate active development of the queen's bishop by means of 4... .f5?! is not good and is played very little because White then has 5 cxd5 cxd5 6 vNb3, when the desirable answer
6...Qb6 can be met by 7 <21xd5.
Finally, there is 4...g6 to be taken into ac- count, but this variation is far less popular than its cousin 3 4bc3 Nf6 4 e3 g6, the Schlechter Variation (see page 39). Because White has not yet played e3, he has some aggressive options that are unavailable to him in the Schlechter proper. 5 cxd5 cxd5 6 Bf4 in particular is con- sidered quite good for White. Slav Accepted 4 ... dxc4(D) To begin with, 4...dxc4, commonly called the Slav Accepted, is viewed by many as the only true way of playing this opening. It was this line which first drew serious attention to the Slav when it was played in the 1935 and 1937 World Championship matches between Alekhine and Euwe. Many famous grandmasters have used it since then, most notably perhaps World Cham- pion Vasily Smyslov in the 1950s.
4...e6 is the other 'traditional' move. This
position is often reached via other move-orders; e.g., 1 d4 Q3f6 2 c4 e6 3 51f3 d5 4 Nc3 c6. It is called the Semi-Slav and it is the starting point for some of the most complicated variations the Queen's Gambit complex has to offer. A list of 'other moves' has to start with 4...a6
(D).
This move may look rather silly at first, yet it has been played by some of the world's best players since it started to become popular in the late 1980s and it is closing in on the two traditional main lines fast. It combines many of the characteristic traits of modem chess: it is provocative, flexible and it is based - al- though it may not look it at first sight - on sound positional principles. Black intends to meet the plausible 5 e3 with 5...b5 6 b3 and now 6...jkg4, an attractive developing move, which when played one move earlier would have been met by Rb3, but is now perfectly satisfactory. Theory of this very young varia- tion is growing fast, in recent years concen- trating mainly (but by no means exclusively) on the logical rejoinder 5 c5. This variation has been very popular at all levels ever since its introduction in the 1930s. 5 a4 Not a useful developing move at all, yet this is by far the most common reply to the Slav Ac- cepted. White prevents 5...b5, which is the rea- son why the alternatives 5 e4 and 5 e3 are not often played. Despite the loss of time involved and the obvious weakening of the queenside pawn-structure (Black's pieces will make good use of the b4-square in the future) 5 a4 has al- ways been regarded as White's best chance for an opening advantage. Not that the other two moves have not had their loyal followers: 5 e4?! is a true gambit because Black re- mains a pawn up after 5,..b5. This line has al- ways attracted the bold and the impatient, but
SLAV AND SEMI-SLAV 31
nobody has ever been successful enough to lure the more cautious away from 5 a4. The crucial position is reached after 5...b5 6 e5 $jd5 7 a4 e6. White has more space on the kingside and may try to utilize this by playing 8 axb5 Nxc3 9 bxc3 cxb5 10 •SigS Jlb7 11 Qh5 g6 12 Rg4 or an immediate 8 4*2)g5. The problem with this type of approach is that although it does offer prospects of a quick and brilliant win, it also opens the door to a most drastic defeat. The alternative 5 e3 is a very different cup of tea. In fact this is even more cautious than 5 a4 since White not only avoids having to play a gambit but he also avoids having to weaken his queenside. Here too 5...b5 is the critical reply but now White can play 6 a4 forcing 6...b4 (D) and thus robbing the pawn on c4 of its cover (6...a6 does not work on account of 7 axb5 cxb5 8 2Bxb5). Black has a much more provocative alterna- tive in 5...±g4, inviting 6 Ne5, which is a main line after 5...Nf5 as well, so this looks totally stupid because now the knight on e5 attacks the black bishop and White gains a tempo. However, there is actually a very clever point to this: after 6...jLh5 7 f3 Black plays
7...£jfd7 8 Qxc4 e5l, inviting White to lose a
piece by playing 9 dxe5? Rh4+ and - more importantly - creating a very complicated po- sition after 9 Nxe5 <21xe5 10 dxe5 Nd7. At the cost of a pawn, Black has managed to develop his pieces very nicely. Still, the reputation of
5...Ng4 is dubious at best. White has been
fairly successful first with 9 Ne4 and - more recently - with 9 e4 and 9 g3. Black may also consider the non-committal
5...Na6, waiting for White to declare his inten-
tions in the centre and intending to develop his queen's bishop accordingly; e.g., 6 e4 Jtg4. This move also has the advantage of allowing Black to answer 6 Ne5 with 6..Ag4 7 <53xc4 e51, which is an improved version of the 5...Bg4 line. This variation has never been really popu- lar, but it is not bad and by playing it Black avoids an enormous amount of theory. We now return to 5...Jtf5 (D): However, White will have to withdraw his knight from c3 and redevelop this piece, which means that he can put very little immediate pressure on his opponent's position. 7 Qha2 e6 leaves the knight awkwardly stranded on a2 while after 7 <2hbl jNa6 White will have to in- vest additional time and effort in getting his pawn back. Black will be able to develop his pieces quite comfortably in both these lines. Nevertheless this line may be perfectly suitable for those wishing to reduce the element of risk to a minimum. 5 ... Af5 This simple developing move has always been by far the most popular choice. Starting from this position many thousands of games have been played, leaving behind layer after layer of theory. This never-ending process of improving, going deeper, refining and sometimes changing track abruptly, is likely to continue as long as chess will be played. There are two main lines. 6 e3 and 6 4 e5, which are equally good but completely differ- ent in character.
6 e3 is the simple move. While calmly con-
tinues his development and does not commit himself yet to any middlegame strategy. It does not, however, lead to a simple type of position. A heavy positional struggle can be expected here, requiring great stamina from both players.
6 Qe5 is the more ambitious choice. White's
plan is to build a strong centre by means of f3 and e4. If this plan succeeds he will have won the opening battle, but Black has two possible reactions both leading to a hard-to-judge type of position. The standard continuation after 6 e3 is 6...c6
7 Nxc4 Nb4 8 O-O O-O (D) (or 8...Nbd7). Here
again White has two main lines, each with a distinct strategic idea. A lot now depends on how Black reacts to this plan. Initially 9 Nh4 was most often met bj
9..Bg4 intending to draw White's kingside
pawns forward and hoping to exploit any weak- nesses that might result from 10 f3 Jih5 1 1 g4 aLg6. In practice, however, this has proved tc be no easy task for Black. Nowadays the la- conic 9...'?>bd7 is usually preferred (9..Bg6 is also possible). After 10 xf5 exf5 White ther has the two bishops, but the pawn on f5 forms t strong barrier against an attack both in the cen- tre and on the kingside. Against 6 eS there are also two mair defences: 6...e6 and 6...Nbd7. The crucial test of 6,..e6 is 7 f3 i-b4 8 e4 when the point of Black's opening play is tc sacrifice a piece for three pawns by playing
8... .xe4 9 fxe4 Nxe4 (D).
This sets the opponent some very concrete problems: 10 Rf3 can be met by the cold- blooded 10...Rxd4 while the alternative 10 Jfdi does not look particularly attractive either, alsc because of I O...'B/xd4. Yet it is precisely this variation which suddenly became excecdinglj popular in the 1990s and which is still being in- vestigated to this day in ever-increasing detail The crux of the matter is that most endgame; after 1 1 Qxe4 Qxe4+ 1 2 Qe2 Nxd2+ 1 3 ?xdl have turned out to be much more difficult fo: Black (often to the point of being untenable than older theory assumed. Black's problem; were exacerbated by the fact that it also provec unexpectedly difficult to take any advantage o the exposed position of the white king The older and more traditional one is 9 Re2, intending to play e4. Black could try to obstruct this, e.g. by playing 9...Qte4, but most players just allow White to carry out his plan and con- tinue 9...4r)bd7 10 e4 .g6. This position is ac- tually a very tense one with White controlling more space in the centre and Black exerting strong pressure on that centre, without there be- ing a clear formula for either player how to con- tinue. In this type of position the weakness of b4 makes itself felt: White has very little oppor- tunity of creating attacking chances on the queenside. The alternative 9 h4 pursues a different idea: White wants to exchange the black bishop.
SLAV AND SEMI- SLAV 33
The most important variations arise from
13...Qd5+ 14 'uPc2 a6 15 Q)xc4. In this posi-
tion Black may castle either side, with great complications to be anticipated in both cases. The whole variation is fascinating and may be particularly suited for lovers of unbalanced ma- terial and of course for the diligent and ambi- tious student. For those who are scared off rather than at- tracted by this recommendation there is the alter- native 6...£tbd7, which has been the dominant choice in recent years, as Slav players have seemingly lost faith in the bishop sacrifice line discussed just above. This is a move with a to- tally different purpose. Black wants to meet 7 Axc4 with 7...Qc7, when he is threatening to take the initiative in the centre himself by play- ing 8...e5. White has only one effective antidote to this plan: 8 g3 e5 9 dxe5 <2?Bxe5 10 Jkf4 (D), forcing the opponent to slow down a little in or- der to neutralize the pin against his knight on e5. Semi-Slav 4 ... e6 ( D) The name Semi-Slav points at the hybrid character of this variation. With its distinctive move ...e6 it is in effect a cross between the Slav and the Queen's Gambit Declined. w Again the threat of taking on c4 forces White to take a major decision. He cannot very well fall back on the Exchange Variation any more since 5 cxd5 exd5 is now relatively easy for Black (see page 22). Also 5 Rb3, though not of course a bad move, does not really make life very diffi- cult for Black. Both Queen's Gambit Dcclined- inspired classical development like 5...J.e7 6 .Ng5 O-O and a more Slav-orientated approach like 5...dxc4 6 Rxc4 b5 should yield Black a satisfactory position. The latter variation might continue along the lines of 7 Rd3 4t)bd7 8 e4 b4 9 4)a4 Ra5 10 b3 c5 with equal chances. By far the most popular moves, which have grown into enormously theoretical main lines over the years, are 5 e3. generally leading to the Meran Variation, and 5 fLg5. the Anti-Mcran Gambit, daring Black to take on c4.
5 e3 and the Meran Variation
5 e3 Black now has a large choice of acceptable moves. 5 ... Nbd7 (D) This is the standard option, and also the main path to the Meran. This can be achieved by cither 10...Sd8 1 1 Bel Bd6 or 10...<ifd7. The latter is the more popular choice. After 1 1 Ag2, the traditional line is H...f6 12 O-O, when Black can choose between 12...Jl.e6 or the sharper and more modern 12...Nc5; in neither case has White found it easy to break down Black's firm hold on the centre. However, since 2000. Il...g5!? has been a major alternative that White must take very seriously. Despite its shocking ap- pearance, this move has a firm logical founda- tion as it breaks the pin on the e5-knight due to White's undefended knight on c4.
34 FUNDAMENTAL CHESS OPENINGS
6 Nd3
This is White's most natural move, allowing Black to head for the Meran by taking on c4. However, it says much about the respect in which Black's following moves are held that practically every legal move in this position has been tried to steer the game in a different direc- tion, Still, even the most widely accepted of these alternatives, 6 Rc2, is not particularly dangerous for Black. It is true that taking on c4 is then inaccurate since after 6...dxc4 7 Bxc4 White simply has a very useful extra move (Rc2) compared to the main line after 6 jid3, but the position after 6... .d6 7 .d3 (or 7 Be2)
7...O-O 8 O-O offers Black several possibilities of
obtaining a good game; e.g., 8...dxc4 9 Bxc4 and now either 9...b5 or 9...e5. Waiting moves too, at least the sensible ones like 8...Re7, have been shown to be perfectly playable. The only theoretical problem seems to be the wild 7 g4 (instead of 7 jLd3 or 7 .e2), creating unfath- omable complications and steering the game in a totally different direction. 6 ... dxc4
7 Nxc4 b5 (D)
This build-up. introduced by Rubinstein in Meran 1924, bears a strong resemblance to the Queen's Gambit Accepted and has been ex- tremely popular for at least half a century. Black relinquishes his stronghold on d5 in order to de- velop his queenside. Within just a few moves he will be ready to strike back against White's cen- tral position with ...c5. This is a very dynamic and flexible way of playing. 8 _4.d3 ' Again this seems to be the best square for the bishop. 8 Ab3 and 8 ii.e2 have also been played but without a firm grip on e4 White will not be able to act quickly in the centre. 8 ... a6 An inconspicuous move, yet this is the start- ing point for a truly magnificent complex of variations. Black's strategic aim is to attack the pawn on d4 with ...c5. This will stop White from con- centrating all his forces on the kingside where he would otherwise be able to build up a rather threatening initiative starting with e4. This plan may be executed in several ways. Of these 8...a6 is only one, albeit the most im- portant one. The first alternative to be considered is 8...b4. It looks as if this is not very good because after the logical continuation 9 5te4 Be7 10 O-O O-O 1 1 Nxf6+ <5jxf6 1 2 e4 White appears to have achieved his strategic goals while Black does not seem to have made a lot of progress. Yet on closer inspection it is revealed that Black has not done so badly because he will now simply play 12...Ab7, when ...c5 is unstoppable. Just how crucially important this advance of the c- pawn is. is shown by the fact that if White now plays 13 e5 Black will not move his knight to the superficially attractive central square d5. but to d7 from where it supports ...c5. Black has another plausible and sound possi- bility in 8...Bb7 (D). If White then reacts by advancing in the cen- tre immediately (9 e4) he will play 9...b4 10 4ja4 c5 1 1 e5 Nd5. This position has turned out
SLAV AND SEMI-SUV 35
of variations that is very hard to see through and is still in the process of being explored. White's best response is 11 <?3xb5. when Black has three major options: ll...Ng4, ll...axb5 and ll...Nxe5. The last move is based on the spectacular sequence 12 xe5 axb5 131cxb5+ jLd7 14 Nxd7 Qa5+ 15 Nd2 Qxb5, leading to approximate equality. Anyone wishing to play one of these highly dynamic variations should be able to calculate very accurately. A single wrong step can be fatal. Later it was thought that the more positional
10 d5 refutes Black's opening, especially be-
cause 10...exd5 is well met by 11 e5. This ad- vance is much more awkward for Black now than a move earlier. Also keeping the position closed by playing 10...e5, although not bad, tends to favour White in the long run, provided he takes the precaution 1 1 b3 in order to impede further queenside expansion by Black. That is why the immediate 10...c4 is consid- ered Black's strongest reply to 10 d5 (Black can also play 10...Qc7 as a move-order subtlety, but he will need to play ...c4 in most lines quite soon). If White then simply retreats his bishop (1 1 jlc2) closing the centre by means of 1 l...e5 becomes much more attractive. The critical test of 10...c4 is thought to be yet another vigorous move: 1 1 dxe6. Now 1 1 ...fxe6 12 Jlc2 leads to a sharp middlegame with chances for both sides. Black will be able to develop his pieces very ag- gressively (...Bc5 or ...Rc7, ...Bd6 and ...£te5) while White has options like e5 and Ng5 with possible attacking chances on the kingside. 1 l...cxd3 12 exd7+ Rxd7 is also playable and perhaps more solid than 1 l...fxe6.
5 Xg5 and the Anti-Meran Gambit
5 Ng5 (D)
Not only is this a perfectly natural develop- ing move, it is also a challenge. 5...dxc4 will now produce the ultra-sharp Botvinnik Varia- tion. a line which has had the greatest of play- ers baffled in the past, and which requires tremendous theoretical knowledge from any- one. Of course Black is not forced to play this. He may prefer 5...Nbd7, transposing to the to be perfectly playable for Black, tactically be- cause losing the right to castle after 12 Nxc5 Nxc5 13 dxc5 Bxc5 14 Jlb5+ 'Ne7 is not a problem, and strategically because other moves, such as 12 O-O cxd4, always leave White with a somewhat isolated and vulnerable knight on a4 making it difficult for him to utilize his space advantage on the kingside. After 8...a6 Black is ready to play 9...c5. If White really wants to test this variation he will have to respond without delay.
9 e4 c5 (D)
We have arrived al the most important start- ing position of the Meran Variation. For almost a century White has been trying to refute Black's opening play outright. Al first
10 e5 seemed the proper way to do this but it
quickly transpired that Black has a very strong rejoinder to this advance in 10...cxd4. This ex- change of hostilities creates a veritable jungle

13 e5 Nd5 1 4 '21e4 has caused no end of confu-
sion ever since its introduction in January 2008. Much more cautious and more traditional is 6 .s.xf6 xf6. This is a positional variation which poses subtle problems, like what is the best plan for Black after 7 e3 (7 e4 is considered rash due to 7,..dxe4 8 <2)xe4 Ab4+) 7...Q>d7 8 Jld3? Perhaps the answer is 8...dxc4 9 Axc4 g6 100-0 jlg7, when 1 1 e4 can be met by ll...e5. Cambridge Springs Variation of the Queen's 5 ... dxc4 (D) Gambit Declined, or 5...Jce7, which also avoids great complications. But the most important alternative is 5...h6, which is an important variation in its own right and is known as the Moscow Variation. Now if the bishop retreats (6 Jkh4) taking on c4 pro- duces a very different sort of game from the Botvinnik Variation because after 6...dxc4 7 e4 Black will be able to throw in 7...g5 first and only after 8 JlLg3 will he defend his pawn on c4 by playing 8...b5 (D). This variation, named after world champion Mikhail Botvinnik (1911-95), leads to a posi- tionally unbalanced, even chaotic middlegame. In very many cases there is no question of mate- rial equality either, making it even harder to judge a position or to decide what is the best move. It really is a variation for specialists and lovers of thorough opening preparation with a good feel for the dynamic aspects of chess. A good memory is also recommended. Theory stretches its tentacles far into the middlegame, even into the endgame in this line.
6 e4 b5
Without this, Black's previous move would make little sense, but it would be far too simplis- tic a view of the Botvinnik Variation to assume that Black is just thinking of consolidating a material gain here. It is all about dynamics. 7 e5 For a long time this was thought to be highly dubious for White at best, but recently this judgement has been queried. White simply continues 9 Ae2 and turns out to have a surpris- ing amount of compensation for the missing pawn in his strong pawn-centre and in potential attacking chances against the black king. In fact, this is one of the crucial variations of
SLAV AND SEMI-SlAV 37
This is the most important starting point of the Botvinnik Variation. At first glance it seems impossible that this position should in any way be desirable for Black, but the hidden dynamics become obvious if one imagines Black continu- ing ...Ab7, ...Rb6. ...O-O-O and ...c5, when all of a sudden his position springs to life. In fact the pressure against d4. the open files on the kingside and Black's pawn-mass on the queen- side that may result from this set-up have un- nerved many an unprepared and unsuspecting opponent in the past. White has to act deci- sively and fearlessly. It is, for instance, quite necessary after 11 exf6 _<.b7 to continue 12 g3, because this both defends the kingside against an attack on h2 via the h8-h2 diagonal and pro- vides an excellent square on g2 for the bishop. White need not worry about the rejoinder 12...c5 because this allows 13 d5 (D), a bold advance that is usually of crucial importance whenever Black plays ...c5 in this variation. This is what makes the variation attractive to White. Black has only one response: 7 ... ' h6 8 .Bh4 g5 (D) 9 (rixg5 White too must be energetic. 9 Bg3 5)d5 would not get him anywhere (compared to the above-mentioned Moscow Variation White has conceded the d5-square). He does have a possi- ble alternative though in 9 exf6 gxh4, when 10 53e5 Rxf6 11 a4 was popular for a while in the 1990s (without ever being able to replace 9 Nxg5 though). 9 ... hxg5 10 -"xg5 4)bd7 (D)
10...Be7 11 exf6 Bxf6 has also been played,
but the text-move is more aggressive. Black docs not want to lose any time over the capture of the white pawn that is soon going to appear on f6. Just how explosive the situation is, becomes clear if Black now plays 13...b4?, when 14 J.xc4'. bxc3 15 dxe6 would win instantly. A much better idea is to play 13,..Rb6 14 Xg2 O-O-O 15 O-O and only now 15...b4. This leads to a ferocious middlegame battle, demanding thor- ough theoretical preparation from both players. Another variation that illustrates the level of difficulty of the Botvinnik Variation starts with 11 g3. If Black now simply continues 11..Jlb7
12 Ag2 Rb6 a transposition to the above-
mentioned line with 13 exf6 O-O-O 14 O-O c5 15 d5 is likely, but he may also consider ll...Ng8,

3 2k3 (D) An important option of course is 3...e6. This is the Noteboom (or Abrahams) Variation, which I have classified as part of the Queen's Gambit Declined in this book (see page 13) but which might equally reasonably be seen as a variation of the Slav or a form of the Semi- Slav. Still, Black's most important move, just as it was against 3 Nf3, is: 3 ... Nf6 Now 4 f3 of course produces the main line that we have already looked at.

4 e3 (D)
Black now has several alternatives to the 'normal' developing move 3...£tf6. To begin with, 3...dxc4 needs to be consid- ered. The implications of this move are slightly different from 3 €Bf3 dxc4. White's strongest reply is considered to be 4 e4, intending to meet
4...b5 with 5 a4. thus undermining the pawn on
c4. If 5...b4 White plays 6 5)a2, when both
6...e5 and 6...4Bf6 have been tried. Theory has
not come to any conclusions that are worth mentioning, but practice suggests that this line does not appear to be a problem for White. The same holds true for 3...e5 (D), the Wina- wer Counter-Gambit. Nevertheless a refutation of this old varia- tion has never been found. The idea is to meet 4 dxe5 with 4...d4 5 )e4 Qa5+. when both 6 Ld2 Qxe5 7 21g3 and 6 Nd2 Nd7 7 S)f3 2Bxe5
8 Nxd4 €)xc4 allow Black to win back his
pawn with a reasonable game. 4 cxdS cxd5 5 <2)f3 e4 6 Ne5 f6! 7 'S'a4+ •SW is also consid- ered playable for Black due to 8 Ng4 Nf7 ! 9 Nxd5?! Nb6'..

As we have seen before. Black has no prob- lems after 3 Nf3 Nf6 4 e3, because he can then develop his queen's bishop very comfortably

with 4...Jlf5. With a knight on c3 instead of f3 this is a different matter altogether, because now 4...Bf5 can be met by 5 cxdS cxd5 6 fb3!, when the plausible answer 6... b6 just drops a pawn to 7 )xd5. If Black wishes to play a Semi-Slav (with White committed to the 5 e3 lines), then he can play 4...e6, when 5 Nf3 completes the trans- position, but if he wishes to avoid the main lines Black often chooses either the modem move 4".a6. with consequences very similar to 3 ?3f3 €)f6 4 5)c3 a6, or the more tradi- tional... 4 ... g6 (D) White's most natural move in this position is
6 Bd3. Black then usually plays to exchange
his queen's bishop, a strategy which will leave him with a flexible position for the middle- game. The main line runs 6...O-O 7 O-O -Ng4 (7..Bf5 is also sometimes played). If now 8 h3 Jcxf3 9 Qxf3 Black may try to take over the ini- tiative by playing 9...dxc4 10 .xc4 <2)bd7 to be followed by ...e5 or he may just play 9...e6 and
10...Nbd7, keeping his options open.
In order to avoid this, White sometimes plays
6 Jce2. when Black may still play 6...O-O 7 O-O
Jlg4 of course, but because f3 is now covered by his bishop White then has the sharp reply 8 cxd5 cxd5 9 Rb3 without having to worry about taking on f3 (and getting saddled with doubled pawns as a consequence). In fact he more or less forces Black to weaken his queen- side, if only very slightly, by 9...b6. With the white bishop on e2 though, the central advance e4 is no longer an issue, so Black may decide to try a less aggressive move than 7...J.g4. 7...a6 is an interesting alternative, intending to play
8...b5. 7...e6 too. with the idea of 8...?)bd7,
9...b6 and 10...Ab7, does not look bad.
This is the Schlechter Variation, a hybrid of a Slav and a Grlinfeld. Because White has al- ready committed himself to e3 he does not have the means to react as sharply as in the case of a 'real' Grlinfeld. This has given the Schlechter Variation a very solid reputation. Unlike many other Slav variations, play usually develops at a leisurely pace and is mainly of a positional na- ture. 5 £}f3 Ag7 (D) Queen's Gambit Accepted White now has to make up his mind. He may want to go all-out in the centre by playing 3 e4 or he may prefer to adopt a more flexible alti- tude and play 3 Nf3. Two other moves, 3 e3 and 3 43c3, were con- sidered less accurate for a very long lime be- cause they allow the bold response 3...e5. The position after, say, 3 e3 c5 4 dxe5 Wxdl-i- 5 'S'xdl Ae6 is indeed fine for Black, but recent practice has shown that White can do much better: 4 Jlxc4! exd4 5 exd4 (or 3 4te3 e5 4 e3! exd4 5 exd4) when the resulting middlegame with an isolated pawn on d4 is perfectly play- able for White. If Black avoids this, play will usually trans- pose to a main-line 3 43f3 variation; e.g., 3 e3 <?2Jf6 4 Jlxc4 e6 5 41)13.

Having read the two previous chapters and noticed the multitude of variations where Black plays ...dxc4 at some point, the reader may have started wondering whether it is not much sim- pler to take on c4 straightaway. The answer is a very simple yes, it is much simpler. By playing 2...dxc4 Black defines the outlines of the middlegame. While will have to regain the pawn which gives Black time to at- tack in the centre, usually with ...c5 or ...e5. But whether it is a good idea to make this decision so early in the game is another matter. In fact this question is almost impossible to answer in a general way. It is very much a mat- ter of choosing a type of middlegame. Are there positions that you prefer or that you wish to avoid? This is of course a very personal matter. By playing the Queen's Gambit Accepted, Black really turns the logic of most of the ...dxc4 variations of the previous two chapters around. Instead of developing his pieces first and waiting for a suitable moment to capture on c4, he takes on c4 first and then adapts his development to the set-up chosen by White for recapturing the pawn. 3 e4
3 e4 (D)
For a long time this very natural reaction to
2...dxc4 suffered the same fate as 3 e3 and 3

3...e5. The difference is that in this case White
has the promising pawn sacrifice 4 43f31 exd4

QUEEN'S GAMBIT ACCEPTED 41
Another way of drawing the enemy forward is 3...Nf6, when 4 e5 (4 ?k3 makes 4...e5 even more attractive than on the previous move) 4,..$)d5 5 Jtxc4 offers White more space, but Black will have a solid position and a very use- ful square on d5 for his pieces. This variation has become very' popular of late, with attention focusing mainly on 5...Qb6 6 Bb3 $Jc6 7 Ne2 i,f5 8 O-O e6 9 £jbc3. More provocative still is 3...4)c6 (D), be- cause this move blocks the pawn on c7 that would normally want to rush forward in this opening, at least in a classical interpretation of it. aggressive and Black will have to take great care in getting his king into safety. This is in fact a lively variation with chances for both sides. Just one example of a critical line: 5,..#Jc6
6 O-O Jle6. Now 7 Bxe6 fxe6 8 'sZb3 Qd7 9
Rxb7 wins back the pawn, but the remaining position is hard to judge. Black has secured his strong pawn on d4 and is catching up in devel- opment fast. Another standard device for counterattack- ing against the white centre consists in 3...c5. The d-pawn is drawn forward. White has of course the very quiet 4 <2)f3 cxd4 5 Rxd4. but 4 d5 is the principal reaction, when the natural follow-up is 4...Nf6 5 £sc3 and now 5...e6. at- tacking the white pawn on d5. The position that then arises after 6 Jlxc4 exd5 7 ?Jxd5 #)xd5 8 Jixd5 ."\e7 9 Nf3 O-O 10 O-O has turned out to be quite reasonable for Black if he attacks White's strong bishop on d5 without delay. This has been done with lO.-.'SiJab followed by 1 l...<22)c7 (and in some cases 12...Be6) and also with 10...'B'b6 and ll...jLe6. Sharper (though not necessarily better) is 6 5)f3, intending to meet 6...exd5 with 7 e5. 1 shall discuss this po- sition when we look at the variation 3 *5Af3 Jf6 4 <5Qc3 c5 below.
5...b5 (D) (instead of 5...e6) is an alterna-
tive. It comes as no surprise therefore that the playability of this variation largely depends on accurate calculations. Black has to know what he is doing, but if he does, this is a tricky' varia- tion also for White. Black intends to meet 4 d5 with 4...?)e5 and 4 with 4...Xg4. The main

Black has tried both the fairly solid 6...Ne7 7 .xc4 Q>g6 and the more bellicose 6...l?)a5. 3 £tf3 3 -Nf3 (D) Throughout the history of the Queen's Gam- bit Accepted, this has been White's most popu- lar move in this position. White does not hurry to win back the pawn that he has sacrificed. He calmly develops his pieces and offers his oppo- nent as few targets for an immediate counterat- tack as possible. This is far more speculative and has as yet not been analysed very thoroughly. Black does not have to worry about 6 Qxb5 #a5+ 7 c3 <?)xe4 nor does 6 e5 b4 pose a serious threat, but a dangerous move seems to be 6 Af4.
J2 FUNDAMENTAL CHESS OPENINGS
different idea. Black attacks the white centre straightaway. The most principled reply 4 d5 is met by 4...e6 and what makes this variation par- ticularly interesting is that the quiet 4 e3 allows
4...cxd4 5 exd4 Ae6, making it a little more dif-
ficult for White to get his pawn back. We now return to the position after 3...S)f6
(D):
3 ... Nf6 Alternatives to this natural move are mostly subtle attempts either to lure White into one of the variations discussed below or to avoid one of them.
3...a6. for instance, intends to steer clear of
the sharp 3...£}f6 4 4t)c3 lines, hoping to trans- pose to the much quieter 3...£tf6 4 e3 variation after 4 e3 £jf6 5 Bxc4 e6 6 O-O c5. The point of
3...a6 is to meet the straightforward 4 e4 with
4...b5, when the standard reply 5 a4 is not as
powerful as White would like it to be because Black has 5...alb7 attacking the pawn on e4. On
4 c3 Black also has 4...b5, when 5 a4 can be
met with 5...b4. The same logic applies to 3...e6, Black wants to meet 4 e4 with 4...b5 5 a4 Ab 7 (or 5...c6 6 axb5 cxb5 7 b3 Ab"), when things arc rather unclear. Here too 4 e3 will normally transpose to a 3...Nf6 4 e3 variation. Theory of both these moves is still in the ex- perimental stages.
3...c6 is again very similar. This move was
discussed in the chapter on the Slav and Semi- Slav (see page 29). Here too Black tries to 'do something' with his pawn on c4 rather than fol- low the classical recipe of just giving it away and developing his pieces instead. The most straightforward 'defence' of c4 of all, 3...b5. is not to be recommended, however. In fact this move will give White the ideal op- portunity to start an attack on all fronts by 4 a4 c6 5 axb5 cxb5 6 b3 cxb3 7 e4.
3...c5. a move that we have already seen as a
possible reply to 3 e4. is based on a completely Now there arc two main lines. The sharper is
4 Nc3 intending to continue 5 e4. The older and
more popular is 4 e3 A third option is 4 S&'a4+. which is certainly not bad. but does not pose Black as many prob- lems as the two main lines. A solid reply is
4...c6 5 Rxc4 ji.f.5. giving the game a distinctly
Slav flavour.

QUEEN'S GAMBIT ACCEPTED 43
and now the far from obvious 8...<2Bb6, really takes the sting out of While's attacking plans. The game takes on a positional character and the chances are more or less equal. While this heavy theoretical battle raged through the 4...a6 line, the alternative 4...c5 was also explored in great depth. At first this move seemed unattractive because of the violent at- tack 5 d5 e6 6 e4 exd5 7 e5! but some staunch supporters of the black cause managed to estab- lish a solid defence following 7...i5)fd7 (D). This aggressive move has caused many a devotee of the Queen's Gambit Accepted (in- cluding - 1 am sorry to have to admit - myself) some sleepless nights, especially in the 1970s when theory recommended 4...a6. It is pre- cisely this move which involves great risk for Black if White continues unflinchingly 5 e4 b5
6 e5 $ld5 7 a4. Although this position may look
attractive for Black, White's attacking chances are in fact very dangerous, particularly if White is a player with a natural flair for the initiative who is not afraid of sacrificing some material. One example of what Black is in for in this line is provided by the variation 7...c6 8 axb5 Nxc3 9 bxc3 cxb5 10 £Ag5 ! f6 1 1 Rf3 2a7 12 e6!. Although it is actually highly unclear how this position should be evaluated, it is clear that having one's kingside squashed is not to every- one's taste. The most obvious defence runs 7...Nxc3 8 bxc3 (D). To begin with, it was discovered that after 8 ' xd5 the surprising 8...Nb6 is perfectly satis- factory for Black and even the loss of tempo in- volved in 8 -igS Ne7 9 Axc7 Qxc7 10 Qxd5 's d8 turns out not to have any damaging effect on the black position provided he dislodges the knight on d5 as soon as possible. In fact the variation 1 1 Axc4 Nc6 12 O-O 5)b6! is consid- ered about equal. Black also has two fully acceptable trans- positional moves at his disposal. 4...e6 produces a variation of the Queen's Gambit 'Declined' (1 d4 d5 2 c4 e6 3 <2te3 Nf6 4 £tf3 dxc4) while af- ter 4...c6 we suddenly find ourselves in a Slav Accepted! 3 2rf3 <2)f6 4 e3
4 e3 (D)
This has always been the most popular way of meeting the Queen's Gambit Accepted. White wins back his pawn and calmly develops his kingside before taking any further action. Now the natural 8... .b7 is also not safe: once more 9 e6! gives White a very dangerous attack. During the 1980s it was established that
8...Qd5 is more solid, yet here too White turns
out to have sufficient compensation for the pawn if he calmly plays 9 g3 Jkb7 10 Jlg2 W7 1 1 Jla3. Black is under pressure, though it is only fair to add that he is not without chances either. A gambit will always be a double-edged sword. It was not until the very last years of the 20th century that a truly solid defence against this variation was unearthed at last. Much to every- one's surprise it turned out that 7...e6 8 axb5,
CHESS OPENINGS
4 ... e6 Black also develops unhurriedly. The attempt to hang on to the pawn on c4 by
4...b5 is ill-fated. White immediately demol-
ishes the black pawn-phalanx with 5 a4 c6 6 axb5 cxb5 7 b3 and gets the upper hand.
4...,Bg4 is more interesting. This active move
poses White some concrete problems and is not easy to refute. In the early days it was thought that White could just win a pawn by 5 Bxc4 e6 6Qb3 until it was demonstrated that Black gets an excellent game if he replies 6..Bxf3 7 gxf3 Q3bd7 8 'S'xb? c5. White has an extra pawn but is lagging behind in development. A more care- ful approach is (5 Jlxc4 e6) 6 <21bd7 7 h3 Jlh5 8 O-O Jcd6 9 e4, but now the true point be- hind 4...Ng4 is revealed: Black will play 9...e5 and hold his ground in the centre. This makes
4...Jig4 a very lively variation with consider-
ably less theoretical baggage to carry than
4...e6.
5 Jlxc4 c5
6 O-O
This is White's most natural move, but he has an interesting and very subtle alternative in
6 Re2 (D).
Unafraid of the isolated queen's pawn that will result from an exchange on d4, he intends to take on c5 if Black continues 6...a6, parallel to the main line. The difference is that in this case 7 dxc5 will not allow an exchange of queens and this makes the position after 7..Bxc5 8 O-O much more dynamic than in the parallel varia- tion 6 O-O a6 7 dxc5. which is discussed below. Remarkably enough perhaps, this position is full of danger for Black because it is precisely in an open position with a symmetrical pawn- structure that a slight lead in development will be felt the most acutely and that is precisely the advantage that White has here. The possibility of an advance in the centre (e4-e5) has to be carefully monitored. One of the many ways that theory has suggested of doing this is 8...<23c6 9 e4 b5 (not 9...e5?? immediately because of 10 Axf7+! *xf7 1 1 ' c4+) 10 Nb3 e5. After 6 O-O Black is faced with a far-reaching choice. The most obvious and also the simplest strategy is to take on d4 and play against the re- sulting isolated d-pawn. This may be done ei- ther at once, by playing 6...cxd4, or in a slightly more subtle way by 6...Nc6, waiting for 7 Qe2 before taking on d4: 7...cxd4 8 Edl Ae7 9 exd4 O-O. If White then continues 10 Nc3, which is the obvious move, 10...<23a5 11 Bd3 b6 fol- lowed by 12...jLb7 is a standard manoeuvre for increasing control over d5. This is a sound way of playing and theory could end here but. unfortunately perhaps, open- ing theory is never satisfied. It always looks fur- ther, it always wants to find something which is even better, even more accurate or even more difficult to handle for the opponent. That is why another move has become the uncontested main line in this position: 6 ... a6(D) Black waits for a more favourable opportu- nity to take on d4 and introduces the possibil- ity of developing his queenside swiftly and comfortably with ...b5 followed by ...Jib7 and ...2>bd7.
QUEEN'S GAMBIT ACCEPTED 45
White has tried several ways of combating this scheme. To begin with. 7 Re2 is important. White simply allows his opponent to carry out his plan and concentrates on his own chances: he wants to gain space in the centre by fidl and e4. After 7...b5 8 Ab3 Nb7 9 Edl Nbd7 10
[diagram]
has to consider not only the e4 advance but d5 as well. These are dangerous plans, but by now theory has worked them out pretty thoroughly and it seems that Black will be able to cope with these threats. The most popular move nowa- days is 10...Rb6. Another idea altogether is to play 7 a4, pre- venting Black's plan in a radical way at the cost of a slight weakening of the queenside. White abandons control over b4, a square which Black can now use for his knights or his king's bishop, especially if he now switches to the old plan of playing against the isolated queen's pawn: 7...<£te6 8 cxd4 9 Edl Jlc7 10exd4 O-O 11 Nc3 (D). This position is crucial for an evaluation of 7 a4 but, as in so many similar cases, here too the question of whether you want to play with or against the isolated queen's pawn is largely a matter of taste. It all boils down to weighing dy- namic features against static ones, which is a difficult but also a very personal matter. Open- ing theory of course does not take a personal view of the matter and just tries to look at all the possibilities as accurately as possible. In this case a verdict has not yet been reached despite decades of practical experience. Black's posi- tion is solid and he has good long-term pros- pects. but for the time being White has the freer piece-play and holds the initiative. A much more flexible strategy that was pop- ular during the 1990s is to anticipate ...b5 by re- treating the bishop straightaway so as to be able to respond to ...b5 with an immediate a4, hop- ing to take over the initiative on the queenside. For this puipose both 7 Bb3 and 7 Jld3 have been played. Black's standard reaction to this plan is to switch to the strategy of playing against the isolated queen's pawn (7...cxd4), but there are a few interesting alternatives. Against
7 J.b3 Black might consider 7,..b5 anyway,
while against 7 Jld3 the subtle 7...£3bd7, some- times followed by 8...b6, is an option. A very radical solution to the problems of this opening is to play 7 dxc5. Although this simpli- fies the position and looks totally harmless at first sight, world champions Boris Spassky' and Vladimir Kramnik have successfully used this idea. After 7...Qxdl 8 Sxdl Jlxc5 White still has that minimal lead in development which a great champion may be able to use to his advan- tage even in the endgame. Finally, White's sharpest move in this posi- tion is undoubtedly 7 e4, yet strangely enough this is not particularly dangerous for Black. White's idea is to play 8 d5 if Black takes on e4 (7... xe4). Although it is far from clear if this poses any problems if Black simply continues
8...Jl.e7. most players prefer 7...b5 8 Bd3 .b7,
which has proved to be very reliable. Other 1 d4 d5 Openings Those 2 <S2jf3 lines where White refrains from (an early) c4 are collectively referred to as the Queen's Pawn Game. The most emphatic way to do without c4 is 2 <?3c3. This somewhat old-fashioned move is known as the Richter-Veresov Opening. Much more modem is 2 dtg5. a move that has become popular in the wake of 1 d4 Q>f6 2 Jcg5, the Trompowsky Attack. Other moves, like 2 -".f4 or 2 e3. arc of course not illegal and are in fact quite often played, but not at the highest level where open- ing theory is forged and where every move has to be better than average. On these moves the- ory' remains silent. Quite the reverse can be said about 2 e4, the Blackmar-Dienier Gambit. This is very rarely played at any level, but a small band of fanatical devotees have developed a considerable amount of theory on this pawn sacrifice. If Black takes up the challenge (2...dxe4) White will continue
3 Nc3 4 f3 exf3 5 4*Axf3 and assume that
his lead in development will compensate for the material deficit. 1 <14 d5 (D) Most games that start like this continue with 2 c4, the most aggressive move. White attacks the pawn on <15. This is the Queen's Gambit. The next most popular move is 2 4)f3, which may either be played to steer away from the Queen's Gambit complex or to enter that com- plex through the back door by playing c4 later, usually with the aim of avoiding certain lines that are specific to the immediate 2 c4. For ex- ample. White may want to counter the Queen's Gambit Accepted (2...dxc4) with the variation 3 <23f3 Nf6 4 5)c3. but he is worried about 2 c4 dxc4 3 <2?>f3 a6. By choosing the move-order 2 <2)f3 3 c4 dxc4 4 Nc3 he achieves his aim. provided of course that he is not worried even more about possible alternatives for Black in this line. In this case he is fairly safe, because the only possible way to get into the 3,..a6 vari- ation would be 2...a6, but this move makes a non-c4 set-up (3 Nf4 or 3 g3 for instance) much more attractive, because ...a6 is practically a wasted move here. Another reason why the position after 2 5)f3 deserves some attention is that it is often reached via 1 Nf3 d5 2 d4. so it is important for 1 41f3 players. Queen's Gambit

OTHER 1 d4 d5 OPENINGS 47 The most important alternative to 2...e6,
2...c6 and 2...dxc4, the three classical openings
that we have investigated in the three previous chapters, is 2...4)c6, the Chigorin Defence. This opening is perhaps not considered as solid as the 'Big Three', but it is still very respect- able.
2...J_f5 is one step further away from the
classical approach. This is a modem idea, which remains as yet unchristened, although the name Baltic Defence has been proposed. Older and duly given a name, yet not fash- ionable at all. is the symmetrical reply 2...c5, the Austrian Defence. Finally, Black's most drastic option is 2...e5, called the Albin Counter-Gambit. 20th century has to a great extent been aban- doned. The principal test of the soundness of 2...4c6 is 3 cxd5. hoping after 3...'Q'xd5 to gain a tempo by playing 4)c3 after first protecting d4. Black has to act quickly. Both against 4 4)f3 and 4 e3 it is of vital importance to play 4...e5. The main line is 4 e3 e5 5 <4c3 jLb4 6 Bd2 .xc3 and now either 7 Bxc3 or 7 bxc3 is good. The former is based on the possibility 7 Jlxc3 exd4 8 4>e2! (Dj. Chigorin Defence 2 ... 4c6 (D) White intends to follow with 9 4)xd4. 7 bxc3 intends to build a strong pawn-centre by means of f3 and e4. Both these lines are hotly debated and make for lively middlegame play. Another important test of the Chigorin is the natural developing move 3 4)c3. Now the thematic 3...e5 is not considered very promis- ing because of 4 cxd5 4)xd4 5 e3 4)f5, but both
3...dxc4 and 3...4)f6 are thought to be playable.
Against 3...dxc4. the sharpest reply is 4 d5 4)e5
5 f4 followed by 6 e4, but this is not played very
often. The most popular move is 4 4)f3, when
4...4)1'6 produces a position that is also relevant
to 3...4)f6 (4 4)f3 dxc4). With 5 e4 Ji.g4 6 Jle3 and now either 6...e6 or 6...Ji.xf3 7 gxf3 e5 be- ing the critical follow-up, this line is similar to the 3 e4 4)c6 variation of the Queen's Gambit Accepted (page 41) and is likely to lead to a tense and double-edged middlegame. 3 4)f3 is also a natural move. The main line here is 3.. Bg4 4 cxd5 Nxf3 5 gxf3 Qxd5 6 e3 e5 7 4)c3 Nb4 8 Nd2 Nxc3 9 bxc3 (D). More than a century after its first bloom, this opening is making a remarkable comeback. With the steadily increasing stream of information and the possibility of computer-assisted analy- sis making opening preparation more concrete than ever before, general guidelines and con- siderations of a positional nature tend to be less authoritative (and less intimidating). Nowadays many players are fully prepared to take some positional risks in the opening in order to seize the initiative. The Chigorin Defence, named af- ter the great Mikhail Chigorin (1850-1908) fits perfectly in this trend and the scepticism with which it was regarded throughout most of the

active piece-play. It is also a highly provocative move, perhaps even more so than 2...'?)c6. This introduces a psychological element into the game: many a player behind the white pieces will feel that he has to punish such reckless opening play and perhaps becomes reckless himself. And in a way it is true that imaginative and aggressive play is required, for if White does no more than simply develop his pieces, he will not achieve any opening advantage (which may not be a problem for some, but terribly frustrating for others). The first point of 2...Jlf5 is that 3 cxd5 is met by 3...JLxbl. Now 4 Ra4+ is a useful move to interpolate, forcing 4...c6, which gives White a choice between 5 Bxbl and 5 dxc6 Nxc6 6 Sxbl, when the sharp 6...e5 is thought to be best. Black regains his pawn and obtains what is usually called 'a reasonable position', mean- ing that theory has not yet examined this very deeply and is working on the primal hypothesis that until proved otherwise chances are consid- ered more or less equal. It is also important to note that 3 Rb3 can (and probably must) be met by the ultra-sharp
3...e5 (D).
By now the reader will have understood that Black should not be afraid to give up his bishop- pair if he wants to play the Chigorin Defence. The very essence of this opening lies in the cre- ation of unbalanced middlegame positions by introducing hard-to-judge positional elements, such as doubled pawns and bishop-against- knight situations. Finally, against 3 e3 the characteristic 3...e5 4 dxe5 d4 is considered a strong reply. This is in effect the Albin Counter-Gambit in a more fa- vourable version. The natural 5 Nf3 runs into
5...fS.b4+, while 5 exd4 Rxd4 gives Black ex-
cellent compensation for the sacrificed pawn.

Theory has even less to say about this (al- though it should, as it is a possible refutation of
2...jLf5) than about 3 cxd5, but practice sug-
gests that this is tricky- since, although 3 Qb3 is perfectly plausible, it is rarely played. The sound developing move 3 4jc3 is much more popular. This is usually met by 3...e6, when things start to slow down a bit. Attacking This move betrays an attitude very similar to the Chigorin Defence: Black is aiming for

More conservative options like 4 '<Bf3 cxd4 5 Qxd4 Rxd5 or 4 dxcS Qxd5 do not cause Black a lot of trouble.

5 dxc5 (D) Black then usually replies 4...c6 in order to meet 5 Rb3 with 5...Qb6. Perhaps rather sur- prisingly 6 c5 is then not met by exchanging queens, but by 6...Rc7 allowing White to gain yet another tempo by 7 jLf4 (7...Rxf4 8 Rxb7 is in White's favour). Still, the position after the modest retreat 7...'S'c8 is not necessarily bad for Black. Because White has played c5. Black's central position is now safe. The position has become closed and fairly slow. White will try to exploit his space advantage on the queensidc. but Black has the prospect of retaliating in the centre by means of ...e5. 3 <2hf3 is also a sound move, deserving care- ful consideration if only because this position often arises via 1 Nf3 or 1 d4 d5 2 Nf3. After
3...e6, 4 Nc3 transposes to 3 <7hc3 e6 4 Nf3,
while 4 Rb3 runs into the aggressive 4...Ghc6 ! . Austrian Defence 2 ... c5 (D) This interpretation of the Queen's Gambit (also known by the natural name, the Symmet- rical Queen's Gambit) has never been fully trusted. Yet there probably is a lot to be discov- ered here and, being as unfashionable as it is, it could well make a wonderful surprise weapon for those who are prepared to put some work in it and perhaps lift our knowledge of this open- ing to a new level. White has managed to hold on to his pawn on d5, which gives him a space advantage and plenty of open lines for his pieces. A logical re- action by Black would be to play 5... xc5 6 ?3f3 e6, eliminating the white pawn, but prac- tice has shown that Black still has his work cut out for him after the simple 7 5}c3 exd5 8

Here too Black will have to be very care- ful not to fall behind in development after 6 Nd2 £kd2 7 Rxd2 >xc5 8 Na3. Black's pawn on d4 is not completely safe. It may be attacked with moves such as Nbd2-b3 or b4 followed by Bb2. Worries over the eS- pawn are misplaced. As long as it survives that is fine, but if it does fall, the strategic plans out- lined above remain unaffected. Strangely enough, despite the sharp nature of the position there are not a lot of clear-cut variations here. White's most popular move is 5 g3, but 5 £sbd2 and 5 a3 have also been played. Black usually continues 5...Jle6 or 5....SLg4. A plausible continuation (after 5 g3) is 5...Be6 6 Qbd2 Qd7 7 Jlg2 (D).

Whoever wants to play this gambit does not need any thorough knowledge of variations, but a good eye for tactical chances and a feel for improvisation are indispensable. Queen's Pawn Game

It could be said that, by not playing c4, White is trying to avoid a fight, but this is de- ceptive and. of course, ultimately impossible. In reality, White simply postpones c4 and waits for Black to show his hand first. If White, for whatever reason, does indeed refrain from playing c4, opening play will Black has created a bridgehead in the centre, he has all the open lines that he can possibly want for a quick development of his pieces and there is the realistic long-term prospect of sur- rounding White's pawn on e5, which will re- store the material balance. Is it strange that this gambit has always held a strong attraction for the daring attacking player? And what does White have to show for all this? Well, in the first place, by playing ...d4. Black has left the hl-a8 diagonal wide open, in- viting a g3 set-up which may result in an attack on the queenside involving b4. Furthermore, OTHER 1 d4 d5 OPENINGS 51 idea. Classical development like 4...Nc6 5 c3 Jld6 is also not bad. If Black is thinking of a ...c5 set-up, he may want to consider the immediate 2...c5 (D). generally speaking be a bit slower than in the Queen's Gambit. In fact we then enter a dimly- lit area on the fringes of opening theory where it is still possible to discern general schemes of development, but where sharp and forcing vari- ations are nowhere to be found. As far as any roads can be said to exist in this border area, they are not highways, but lonely and rarely used footpaths. They may seem im- passable and difficult to spot in some places, but this is never really a problem, because the experienced hiker can be depended upon to find an alternative path without any difficulty. 2 ... Nf6 A useful, neutral reply, for which there are a great number of alternatives.
2...e6 is usually played in order to enter a
specific variation of the Queen's Gambit, for instance 3 c4 dxc4 or 3...c5. It is also a useful preparation for 3...c5 in case White does not play 3 c4. The most popular non-Queen's Gambit move against 2...e6 is 3 Af4 (D). This move introduces a scheme of develop- ment, known as the London System, that may be used against almost any black set-up, but it is more effective if Black has already played ...e6, as is the case here. The general idea is to play W3, Bf4. c3, e3, Jcd.3 and Nbd2, offering prospects of a successful attack on the kingside starting with Ne5. It is difficult to recommend a specific 'best reply' to this, but starting with 3...c5 4 e3 and then playing 4...Qb6. in order to induce White to play the slightly passive 5 Qcl, is a good This is also an important move psychologi- cally. because Black makes it clear that he is ready to take over the initiative, thus provoking a sharp reply or cowering White into submis- sion. Moves like 3 e3 or 3 c3 cannot be said to be downright bad. but in this case they do clearly signal that White is not aiming for an opening advantage. If he finds this too meek. White has only two options. One is to force the opponent back into the realm of the Queen's Gambit by playing 3 c4 (Black may then opt for the Tarrasch Defence by 3...e6, or for the Queen's Gambit Accepted by 3...dxc4). The other is to take on c5 and enter relatively un- known territory. A possible continuation is 3 dxcS e6 4 e4, a motif which we have already

3 g3 is also often met by 3...,".g4, in this case
with 4 3Lg2 Qd7 in mind, with a view to lashing out on the kingside with ...Ah3 and ...h5-h4. This may easily lead to chaotic situations where positional subtleties do not count for much. Another, only slightly less radical, possibil- ity is 3...Bf5 4 Ji.g2 <R3b4. This is not a rash at- tacking move but a clever ploy to clear the way for the c-pawn while at the same time making it more difficult for White to get c4 in. After 5 4)a3 c6 6 c3 "Saab followed by ...e6. Black's po- sition has turned out to be quite solid, much more so in fact than in a Chigorin proper. We now return to 2...<?3f6 (D): seen with colours reversed in the Queen's Gam- bit Accepted.
2...c6 is played with an eye to the Slav De-
fence if White goes 3 c4, while also keeping the active developing moves ...JLfS and ... .g4 in mind if White plays something else. If. for ex- ample, White chooses 3 Af4, then the resulting middlegame after 3...Jtf5 4 c3 c6 5 Bd3 ±xd3
6 Rxd3 Nf6 will be somewhat easier for Black
than the positions after the above-mentioned
2...e6 3 Jtf4. Perhaps in this case 3 jlg5 is the
more aggressive option. Playing 2....Bf5 immediately is also perfectly sound, but it does of course allow White to transpose into a line of the 2...Af5 Queen's Gambit with 3 c4. Other moves, like 3 Bf4 e6. are again perfectly playable, but they do not make life difficult for Black in the opening. Perhaps this is the one line where I would ad- vise even the most fanatical theory hater (who is of course unlikely to read this book) to go for a main line just this once and play 3 c4. Quite the reverse can be said about 2...<$3c6
(O).
In fact the implications of 2...£rf6 are not so different from those of the moves we have just looked at. If White does not wish to return to the Queen's Gambit by playing 3 c4. then 3 Jtf4 and 3 3Lg5 are his most plausible options. A third possibility, which may not look very impressive, but is nevertheless the starting point of a well- thought-out scheme of development, is 3 e3. Superficially modern and sophisticated, but in actual fact quite the opposite, is 3 g3. After
3...jLf5 4 .Ig2 e6 or 3...c6 4 Ng2 Af5 Black's
position is much easier than in the Catalan Opening (page 24). In a situation where Black is able to develop his queen's bishop as com- fortably as this, a g3 set-up is usually fairly in- nocuous. This is an invitation to enter a Chigorin De- fence with 3 c4. Naturally 3 c4 is a perfectly valid option, yet in this particular case even the builders of highways consider two footpaths as just as reliable: 3 jLf4 and 3 g3. These are not intended to avoid c4 altogether, but to play this move a little bit later so as to avoid a few stan- dard Chigorin reactions. 3 3lf4 is usually met by 3...Bg4, when the idea is to play 4 e3 e6 5 c4. 2 2)f3 Nf6 3 Af4

This is yet another form of the London Sys- tem (and we shall be seeing quite a few more in the course of the book, as White can play these moves almost regardless of how Black replies). This variation is not a frequent guest in games at the highest level, because 3 .1'4 does not ex- ert any immediate pressure on Black's position, yet anyone not aspiring to world championship level may rest assured that 3 Jlf4 is a perfectly useful move. Pressure and ambition always work in two directions. Developing his pieces in this way, White also does not exert any pres- sure on his own position. Accidents are unlikely to happen here. White simply and soundly de- velops his pieces. In the end. the intensity of a game of chess does not depend on the choice of opening, but on the effort and intensity that both players in- vest in it. An opening like this offers plenty of possibilities for a fierce middlegame, just as a sharp opening may fizzle out. As I already mentioned when discussing
2...e6, a .£tf4 set-up is at its most effective when
Black has already hemmed in his queen's bishop with ...e6. This means that Black has a fairly easy game here after 3..Bf5 or 3...c6, intend- ing to meet 4 e3 with 4,..Bg4. 3...c5 is also a good move, producing a sort of Queen's Gam- bit with colours reversed after 4 e3. Black then has 4...Nc6 but also the more aggressive option of 4..,Qb6. This move forces White to choose between the modest (but not bad) 5 Qc 1 and the
[diagram]
not exactly attractive for Black, but 5...C4 6 2bl Jlg4 is a very good option. This method of development is slightly more aggressive than 3 Bf4 because it raises some concrete, if not overly pressing, problems. In the first place the possibility of taking on f6, al- though it can hardly be called a threat, now looms over the position. As a consequence the sortie ...<5je4 needs to be considered: is this a welcome improvement of Black's chances or will this knight on e4 turn out to be a potential liability? These problems may not be world- shattering, yet a certain tension is palpable. Black has several ways to react. Undoubtedly the simplest reply is 3...e6, Black continues in classical fashion and shows no inclination to try to wrest the initiative from his opponent immediately. White is allowed a return to the Queen's Gambit (4 c4), but the characteristic Queen's Pawn Game scheme e3, c3, Nbd2, Nd3 with a view to playing either e4 or <Rje5 and 14 is equally justifiable.

If White now takes on f6, Black intends to take back with his g-pawn, while against the quiet 4 e3 he has the aggres- sive options 4...Rb6 and 4... e4. If Black is not worried about being saddled with doubled pawns on the f-file, he may freely
54 FUNDAMENTAL CHESS OPENINGS
play 3...g6, 3...AF5 or 3...c6. In fact, players aiming for Jlxf6 are not likely to play this in combination with 2 Nf3. They will usually pre- fer 2 jLg5 (which will be discussed shortly), to allow themselves greater flexibility - moves like Ne2 or Qf3 may come in useful. Finally, Black's most radical move is un- doubtedly 3...<2>e4. Strangely enough though, theory has little to say on this. It is more or less agreed that, after 4 Jih4, 4...c5 is the sharpest follow-up, when 5 e3 Rb6 6 <R3c3 is considered 'interesting' and 5 dxc5 takes us into practically unknown territory, but basically we are left to work it out for ourselves.

3 c3 (D)
The first move to become accepted as a legit- imate alternative (this was sometime during the 1930s) was 3...JLF5, The old-fashioned response is 4 Jld3, hoping for 4..Bxd3 (4...e6 may well be a better idea) 5 cxd.3 followed by e4, while 4 c4 (with either 4...e6 or 4...c6 the likely answer) is more modern. This 'modern' reaction 4 c4 is also a good re- ply to 3...Js.g4, while if Black plays 3...g6 it even leads us straight into a modem main line of the Griinfeld Defence: 4 c4 Jig? 5 '£k3 (see page 1 32). Of course a set-up without c4 is also playable here. It always is.
3...c5 is also a good move. This may' easily
transpose to our main line, for instance after 4 c3 e6 5 .d3.
4 Jl.d3 c5 (D)
In this position there are two standard plans of development for White. The older, favoured by Zukertort in the 19th century, starts with 5 b3. After 5...?)c6 6 O-O Jld6 7 ,fi.b2 O-O the traditional plan involves Ne5 and f4 with an eye to a possible kingside attack. The modern alternative is to play 8 c4, which may give rise (after 8...cxd4 9 exd4 dxc4 10 bxc4. for instance) to aposition with 'hang- ing pawns', a double-edged pawn-formation which tends to lead to a highly complex middle- game. Black will attack the centre pawns while White may (again) develop a dangerous attack on the kingside. Compared to this, White's second option, 5 c3 (D), is uncomplicated and pretty straightfor- ward. Nowadays this modest little move will prob- ably impress no one as deserving more than a cursory glance. Yet for the greater part of a cen- tury it was looked upon as the main line of the Queen's Pawn Game and some very' strong grandmasters have used it to good effect in the past. But even though we see little of it in top- level tournaments any more and although it has been labelled 'solid but harmless' in the books, even today Black, especially if he suspects noth- ing, may find this ancient line surprisingly dif- ficult to handle. 3 ... e6 This reply was more or less standard during the first half of the 20th century, the heyday of this opening, but there arc other moves. OTHER 1 d4 d5 OPENINGS 55 A positionally-inclined player will perhaps regard this move as somewhat unnatural. White blocks his own c-pawn and by so doing com- pletely rules out the typical Queen's Gambit move c4. Nevertheless this strategy has always had its small band of devotees. After all, White does develop a piece and his strategic aim is sound enough: he wants to play e4. This makes the Richter-Veresov an opening which is strongly related to the 1 e4 openings. It could even be said that this is a 1 e4 opening, but without the vast amount of theory which is attached to the 'real' 1 e4. 2 ... f6 The Richter-Veresov's close relationship to
1 e4 is made emphatically clear if Black plays
either 2...c6 or 2...e6, when 3 e4 will produce a Caro-Kann or a French Defence, respectively. The sharp 2...c5 is not to be recommended if only because of 3 e4 dxe4 4 d5, an Albin Coun- ter-Gambit with colours reversed and an extra tempo for Whi te.
3 Ag5 <?3bd7 (D)
Other moves are not necessarily inferior, but allow White to complicate matters. If 3...c5. for instance, 4 ±xf6 gxf6 5 e3 produces a much more difficult position and if 3...c6, both 4 Jlxf6 and 4 d3 followed by 5 c4 are good alterna- tives to the 'normal' 4 e3 or 4 4>f3. Similarly
3...Bf5 has been answered by both 4 Bxf6 and 4
e3 e6 5 Ad3, again intending to play e4.
3...e6 again allows a transposition to the
French by 4 e4. The plan is to play <?3bd2 and e4, sometimes preceded by capturing on c5. This is the Colle System, which was especially popular in the 1920s and 1930s. It is still an excellent choice for those who want to keep the opening as sim- ple as possible. Black's most plausible reaction is 5...?3c6 6 O-O ±d6 7 &bd2 O-O. when 8 dxc5 ±xc5 9 c4 produces what may be termed the starting point of this ancient opening. Black's best move here is considered to be 9...Qc7 to prevent 10 e5. A slightly more subtle deployment of the queen's knight is 5...£3bd7 in order to capture on c5 with the knight. In this case White, after 6 O-O J-d6 7 hbd2 O-O. usually plays 8 e4 straight- away, though the preparatory move 8 Sei is also moderately popular. Richter-Veresov Opening

56 FUNDAMENTAL CHESS OPENINGS
This simple developing move has pushed the older 4 f3 into the background. Practice has shown that, although 4 f3 is a logical enough move (preparing an immediate e4), Black has too many good replies. The sharp 4...c5 and the waiting moves 4...C6 and 4...e6 have all done very well, as has interpolating 4...116. In fact, al- though f3 is useful in preparing e4. it is a move which White would dearly like to retract after he has played e4, because it gets into the way of fast development (no 2}f3, no dl-h5 diagonal for queen and bishop). For this reason the mod- em Richter- Veresov player tries to get in e4 without 1'3. After 4 Nf3 Black has a solid scheme of de- velopment in 4...g6, when a plausible continua- tion is 5 e3 Bg7 6 ±d3 O-O 7 O-O c5 8 Sei, getting ready to play e4.

dares his opponent to play 6 e4 at the cost of a pawn: 6...g5 7 Bg3 4Txe4, when 8 Nxe4dxe4 9 f5 10 h4 produces rather an obscure posi- tion. White is not without some compensation, certainly, but will it be enough? When during the 1980s the Trompowsky At- tack, 1 d4 <21f6 2 jLg5, came into fashion and quickly gained acceptance as a serious open- ing, some of its pioneers started experimenting with this bishop sortie after l...d5 as well. While 2...-?3f6 transposes to the Trompowsky proper (see page 171) a number of alternatives have been developed into a modest amount of in- dependent theory. Among moves like 2...c5 and 2...f6 (and many others), 2...c6 and 2...h6 3 Bh4 c6 may be loosely called the main lines. They are based on a tactical finesse: after 2...116 3 Bh4 c6 4 e3 (or 2...c6 3 e3 h6 4 Nh4) 4...>b6 5 Qcl (or 5 b3) Black has the rather surprising 5...e5 (D).
2 Ag5
This is based on the fact that taking on e5 loses the bishop (6 dxe5?? Rb4+). Strangely enough though, this has not unduly worried the
2 Jig5 crowd. In the first place many of them
simply play 6 ?3f3 instead of 6 dxe5 and con- tinue as if nothing has happened (and they may have a point, proven in part by the fact that not everyone likes 5...e5; the quiet 5...J.f5 is often preferred). Secondly, White has tried 4 <2313 (in- stead of 4 e3) and this has also held up fairly well in practice. If now 4...Qb6, White intends to play 5 Qcl 6 c4 e6 7 53c3. The battle for the initiative is in full progress. Nimzo-lndian Defence or another and at times White has been so trou- bled by it that the move 3 Nc3 all but disap- peared for some years. Yet every single time this happened, after a while White managed to bounce back with new ideas and new insights. This constant to and fro of the theoretical battle has created a fascinating wealth of variations, a wealth that is not just at the disposal of players looking for a solid opening repertoire but also (and perhaps even more so) of the ardent stu- dent who wants to deepen his understanding of positions where flexibility and dynamic play are the key factors. The first of these dynamic factors confront- ing us is the possible exchange of the Nimzo- lndian bishop for the knight on c3. This was the first question asked of 3...Bb4: does not the position after the straightforward 4 a3 Jkxc3+ 5 bxc3 simply favour White? Demonstrating where Black's chances lie in this type of posi- tion has perhaps been the great contribution by Nimzowitsch to the Nimzo-lndian. Il meant that this simple reply to 3....Bb4. which later came to be called the Samisch Variation, was not a refutation. Then came the more subtle approach: 4 Q'c2, intending to play 5 a3 jLxc3+ 6 Rxc3. White does want the pair of bishops, but not the dou- bled pawns. After initial success, this line fell out of favour because it was thought to be too slow until it was rehabilitated by Kasparov in the early 1990s. Today it is one of White's most dangerous weapons against the Nimzo-lndian. The move which has been the most consis- tently popular one, however, is 4 e3, the Rubin- stein Variation. This may well be called a middle road between the two extremes 4 a3 and
4 White does not avoid the doubled pawns,
but he is confident that the position after 4 e3 ,i_xc3+ 5 bxc3 is so much better for him than the one arising from 4 a3 Bxc3+ 5 bxc3 that he de- cides not to 'waste a move' on 4 Rc2 and simply Named after its pioneer Aron Nimzowitsch (1886-1935), this opening has been one of Black's most popular defences to 1 d4 ever since its 'invention' (adoption really, because it had been played before) by Nimzowitsch dur- ing the 1910s. Black prevents 4 e4, yet unlike the more clas- sical approach that achieves this goal, 3...d5 (the Queen's Gambit Declined), he maintains maximal flexibility for his pawn-formation. Depending on White's reply, Black will be able to choose between a central formation based on ...d5, ...c5, ...b6 or ...d6 (and almost any combi- nation of these). This means that both players will have to as- sess the situation very carefully on practically every single move during the opening stage, not just tactically but strategically as well. This makes the Nimzo-lndian a demanding opening and it may explain why, no matter how highly regarded it may be, this opening is not popular with everyone. Ever since Nimzowitsch. almost all top play- ers have played the Nimzo-lndian at one time

fairly easy game after 7 Xd2 Alxd2 8 Qxd2 ±xc5. continues his development instead. And it is true that 4...Bxc3+ is completely unusual here, but the threat of taking on c3 remains and is exe- cuted in many subvariations a few moves later.
4 Bg5 also allows the exchange on c3, yet
this move poses a counter-threat: how is Black to react to the pin against his knight? This fairly sharp variation was popularized by Spassky and Timman in the 1970s and 1980s.
4 f3 is also a sharp move. It became uncom-
monly popular in the early 1990s, when White was extremely successful with it for a short time. All existing variations and assessments were completely overhauled, swept aside in fact, but soon things began to fall into place and new defences for Black were erected. Still 4 f3 remains a move to be reckoned with. In comparison, the neutral developing move 4 may almost be called less ambitious al- though it is certainly not to be underestimated. It is strongly related not only to 4 e3, but also to 4 g3. Both these moves have also been rehabili- tated by Kasparov. Lastly 4 Qb3 must be mentioned, but the theoretical status of this line can be summa- rized briefly: the move dates back to the earliest times of the Nimzo-Indian, but although it seems sound enough, it fell out of favour for a very long time and to this day is rarely played. 4 'Sfb3 is more forcing than 4 'S?c2 but less flexi- ble.

This is the fundamental test of 3... ,b4. White now has a great many pawns in the cen- tre. giving him plenty of space. He also has the pair of bishops. These factors are not to be un- derestimated and in the hands of a skilful at- tacking player they may easily add up to a dangerous attack. But the downside is that, due to the doubled pawns on the c-file. White's pawn-formation is rigid and vulnerable. It is also still completely uncertain at this early stage whether the bishop-pair is going to turn out to be an asset or a liability. In fact, these positional factors are extremely delicate and the slightest inaccuracy may tip the scales at any moment. Besides, many players are prejudiced in these matters one way or an- other. They simply want the Samisch to be ei- ther good or bad. no matter what the books say. 5 ... c5 This is perhaps the most popular move, both in practice and in theoretical investigations. Black takes a natural step forward in the centre and retains a certain amount of flexibility in his pawn-formation. For instance, the impor- tant decision whether to play ...d6 or ...d5, or whether to castle kingside or queenside, is left open. This last move would obviously be impossi- ble with the queen on c2 and gives Black a
NlMZO -INDIAN DEFENCE 59
On a more fundamental level, however, the choice is not between moves but between plans. How does Black intend to attack the white cen- tre? Which pawn-formation does he have in mind? The range of these plans varies from classical to extremely provocative.
5...c5 may be called classical, while 5...b6 is
perhaps Black's most provocative move, be- cause while allowing his opponent a free hand in building a strong pawn-centre with 6 f3 .i".a6!
7 e4 Black concentrates fully on attacking the
c4-pawn by 7... c6 (D). Here too theory' refuses to give clear answers or even clear variations. After 6 f3. for instance,
6...e5 7 e4c5 8 Bd3 Nc6is a solid plan and one
that we are going to see quite often in this chap- ter. yet Black has varied endlessly on this idea and it is very hard to say what is best. To start with. Black may throw in 6...Nh5 (threatening

may also play 6...c5 7 e4 Clc6 first and leave his opponent guessing whether ...e5 is Still to come. We now return to 5...c5 (Dy. Black intends 8...Na5. Strangely enough, after many years of practice and research, the- ory is still not sure whether this strategy is sound. White has tried both 8 Bg5 and 8 e5 5>g8 9 €)h3 without coming to firm conclu- sions. Another interesting and slightly more mod- est idea is 5...d6 (D). White now has two main lines: the ambitious 6 f3, or the more cautious 6 e3.
4 a3 ±xc3+ 5 bxc3 c5 6 f3
6 f3 This is always the most aggressive approach; White is threatening to play 7 e4. Now Black can either allow this (we have just seen that
6...d6 7 e4 Nc6 is a valid option) or he can act
directly against this plan by taking the initiative in the centre himself. 6 ... d5 7 cxd5 After this logical reply, the character of the middlegame will to a great extent be deter- mined by Black's choice of how to recapture.
7...exd5 gives Black a firm foothold in the
centre and prevents White from playing e4. This is a logical enough strategy, forcing White not only to change plans but also to slow down a little. In fact White has to start developing his
bU FUNDAMENTAL CHESS OPENINGS
kingside now, for which the standard scheme is 8 e3, 9 Nd3, 10 £"c2 and 1 1 O-O. When this is accomplished, he may return to the plan of playing e4. This scheme is fairly straightfor- ward and although it is slow, it is difficult for Black to do any damage before White gets the e4 advance in. That is why the alternative recapture 7...Qxd5 (D) has gradually replaced 7...exd5 as Black's most popular choice.
4 a3 ,xc3+ 5 bxc3 c5 6 e3

This is a more solid option than 6 f3, giving the opponent as little opportunity for counter- play as possible. White wants to play 7 Nd3 followed by 8 5)e2 and 9 O-O, when everything is ready for the central thrust e4. The downside is that, compared to 6 f3, Black has one extra move with which to orga- nize his defences. 6 ... Nc6 This is perhaps Black's most flexible move, but not the only one. A sound alternative is
6...b6 7 Nd3 Nb7 forcing his opponent to make
one more preparatory move (f3) before he can play e4.
7 Nd3 O-O
8 S)e2 b6
9 e4 (D)
Black plays actively, trying to make use of a few concrete disadvantages of the move f3. To begin with. White cannot defend his c-pawn by the seemingly natural 8 Nd2, because this al- lows 8...cxd4 9 cxd4 Qh4+, winning a pawn. This means that White does not have a really comfortable way of protecting c3 (8 Rd3 is rel- atively best in this respect, but then he must take 8...b6 9 e4 Na6 into account), which has caused White to look in an entirely different di- rection. The critical move is now thought to be 8 dxcS. Abandoning the original idea of form- ing a strong pawn-centre (and indeed abandon- ing any idea of a solid pawn-formation). White opens as many diagonals as possible in order to maximize the positive effects of the bishop- pair. It is not the extra pawn that matters, and practice has shown that it is often a good idea for Black to subdue the white bishops by refus- ing to capture either of White's c-pawns too early. Many games have continued 8...#a5 9 e4 l$le7 10 Ne3 O-O II Rb3, when there are so many dynamic factors to be taken into account that it is almost impossible to say who is better.

This is one of the most critical positions of :*e entire Siimisch Variation. With minimal loss :f time, White has managed to create the pow- erful central formation that he had in mind -t hen playing 4 a3. Black now has to defend -vith the utmost accuracy, yet without letting aimself be pushed into a passive position. His next move is far from obvious. 9 ... Ne8 This move was first played by Capablanca and betrays the brilliant positional insight of the great Cuban world champion (1888-1942). By now it has become common property but it is still as vital to Black's plans as it ever was. Before he lashes out on the queenside with ...Ba6 and ...Na5 (and ...<5)e8-d6 if necessary!) Black prevents the pin Bg5 and clears the path for his f-pawn. Play now becomes very complicated. After

for instance, nobody really knows who is better. What is clear, however, is that whoever wants to play this variation (with either colour) should not feel half-hearted or worried about his chances. Total self-confidence is what is re- quired here. 4Wc2

slowly and patiently. In most cases White will play a3 on one of the next moves and recapture on c3 with his queen, thus carefully guarding the integrity of his pawn-formation. To our modern minds the soundness of this strategy seems commonplace, but this was not always the case. In the 1930s the reply 4...d5 was thought to bring about an improved version of the Queen's Gambit Declined (improved from Black's point of view, that is) because White's d-pawn comes under attack. For the same reason 4...?lc6 was thought to be a prob- lem for White. Later it was the move 4...c5 which kept the reputation of 4 Qc2 at a moderately low level and later still the ultra-flexible 4...O-O caused a lol of headaches. But all these problems were solved when around 1990 4 Rc2 suddenly became exceed- ingly popular. All theoretical assessments and variations were overhauled and renewed with great precision. Ever since that time 4 c2 has been held in high esteem by all and sundry.

logical, but after 5...Axc3+ 6 'Q'xc3 Ne4 White is made to feel that his plan, beautiful as it is. is also a trifle slow. Whether Black's initiative is really to be feared is in fact, despite a multitude of high-level games and much analysis, still a very moot point, but it is essential for White to be aware of the potential dangers that 5 a3 is sparking off. To give but a sample line: after 7 Rc2 Black has 7...e5 intending 8 dxe5 Af5, and also 7...Nc6 8 e3 e5 with similar ideas, while the less intimidating 7...c5 8 dxc5 &Sc6 is in fact quite treacherous as well (as is revealed after 9 b4?? Rf61). 5 ... Qxd5 (D) This perhaps somewhat surprising way of re- capturing the pawn had an excellent reputation in the very first days of the Nimzo-Indian, then fell into oblivion for the better part of a century only to be fully rehabilitated in the 1990s. The alternative 5...exd5is also not bad. but a proper evaluation of this move is now thought to depend on (again) a rather sharp line: 6 Ag5 h6 7 Ah4 c5. If Black recoils from this and goes for something like 6...O-O 7 e3 c6 he will in- stead find himself in a slightly inferior version of the Exchange Variation of the Queen's Gam- bit Declined. His bishop on b4 does not fit into this scheme. central pawn-formation, but 6 c5 7 Ad2 Axe 3 8 Axc3, keeping the centre as open as possible in order to enhance the powers of his bishop-pair. Although Black is not under im- mediate pressure in this position, in the long term his prospects are no brighter than obtain- ing a hard-fought draw, which caused 5...Rxd5 to be practically abandoned. Then in 1993 Romanishin introduced the highly original move
6...W5 (instead of 6...c5) and this has caused
the variation to make a full recovery. The end- game after 7 Rxf5 exf5 is considered equal, while other moves (like 7 Rb3 for instance) leave the black queen well positioned on f5.
4 Rc2 <2)c6
4 ... <2)06 This move introduces a simple plan: Black wants to play ...d6 and ...e5.
5 f3 d6 (D)
White can now prevent Black from playing ...e5 very easily by 6 a3 Axe 3+ 7 ' xc3, but in the long run this is impossible. Black will execute his plan by 7...O-O 8 e3 Se8, followed if neces- sary by 9...Qe7, when ...e5 can no longer be prevented. For this reason White's main consideration should not be how to stop ...e5, but how to react when it happens. He has two fundamental op- tions: either White decides to exchange pawns on e5 hoping that the bishop-pair will prove to be an advantage in the resulting semi-open This position was already considered per- fectly playable for Black in the 1930s. but this changed when it was discovered that White should perhaps not play 6 a3 Axc3+ 7 bxc3 or
6 e3 c5 7 Ad2 Axc3 8 bxc3, recapturing on c3
with the b-pawn and hoping to create a strong NlMZO-lNDIAN DEFENCE 63 ??sition, or he plays d5 and relies on his space ./vantage. Both methods are basically sound rnd the choice between them is to a large extent _ matter of taste. Some players prefer 6 J.d2 instead of 6 a3,

White is dangerously lag- ging behind in development, but if Black fails to capitalize on this fast, While will be able to create a strong pawn-centre and he will have the advantage of the bishop-pair in an open po- sition. For a long time the flexible 5...O-O (D) was
4 Rc2 c5 thought to be Black's best move.
4 ... c5 This attack on d4 is so powerful that White is practically forced to abandon this central strong- hold. 5 dxc5 (D) This assessment was based mainly on the possibility of switching to the ...4da6 plan after the neutral developing move 6 Nf3, when
6...4)a6 may be played without the potential
drawbacks (outlined above) of the immediate
5...Na6.
Here too the critical move is 6 a3, practically forcing Black into a ..Bxc5 plan. Only then, after 6...dLxc5, does White start to develop his kingside: 7 'SifS. Just like the position after 5 dxc5 itself, this line was also considered harm- less for Black for a very long time because of
7...6c6 8 Jlg5 4jd4, based on the tactical point
9 Nxd4 ±xd4 10 e3 Ra5. But when it was dis-
covered that this too was 'not quite so easy for Black as we thought' because of 1 1 exd4 Qxg5
12 Rd21, enthusiasm for 5...O-O cooled down a
bit and this line too could now be said to be just 'one of a multitude of possibilities'. Considering the above, it may look rather il- logical to play 5....Nxc5 (D) straightaway, with- out waiting for White to play a3. Even so, this is played quite often, but with a very specific aim in mind: Black wants to re- ply to the natural 6 <R2jf3 with the seemingly The theoretical assessment of this position has shifted very gradually over the years. For decades it was considered 'about equal', but this has changed almost imperceptibly to 'not quite as easy for Black as we thought it was'. Parallel to this, the ranking of 4...c5 dropped from 'the answer to 4 Rc2' to 'one of a multi- tude of possibilities'. In the diagram position Black (again) has several options. Perhaps the most ambitious move is 5...?)a6. Black wants to regain his pawn without making even the smallest concession (like taking a step 'backwards' with ...Bxc5). The idea is to play ...ftxc.5, followed by ...b6 and ...Bb7, gaining firm control over the important central square e4. White's most principled reaction is
6 a3 Jlxc3+ 7 Qxc3 Nxc5, and now either 8

primitive b...Wbb. Because 7 e4 Ng4! would then be most unpleasant for White, he is forced to play 7 e3, blocking the cl-h6 diagonal for his bishop. Thus Black has avoided jLg5, the move which caused all the trouble in the 5...O-O line. As an immediate 6 Bg5? is out of the ques- tion because of b..Axf 2+! 7 l4>xf2 Ng4+, there is little White can do to avoid this. After 6 Nf3 bb 7 e.3 Black calmly retreats his queen to a more civilized square (7...Rc7), fianchettoes his queen's bishop, and awaits further develop- ments. Whether this strategy is objectively good or not, this line undeniably allows Black to avoid a sharp and highly theoretical opening battle. In all probability a rather slow type of middle- game position will come about, in what is known as the hedgehog structure, which will be further discussed in the chapter on the Symmet- rical English. White has executed his plan. Without even the slightest weakening of his pawn-chain, he has acquired the pair of bishops. But does this really mean anything? After all, Black can also claim a few 'theoretical' ad- vantages, like having obtained a small lead in development and having preserved maximal flexibility for his own pawn-chain. It is not easy to answer this question and even less easy actually to play this line, but it pays to make a thorough study of it. It teaches you a few things about the subtleties of positional play. 6 ... b6 Roughly speaking, the outlines of the forth- coming battle have now been defined. But there is almost always some room for deviations from the main road and in this position 6...b5 has earned its rightful place in the books. Black sacrifices a pawn in order to open lines on the queenside so that his lead in development may make itself felt. On 7 cxb5 Black plays 7...cb, when 8 bxcb 'Sjxcb has held up very well in practice. Many players prefer to ignore this challenge, simply carrying on with their stan- dard schemeof development: 8 Bg5 cxb5 9 e3.
6...Ne4 is also an attempt to take the initia-
tive. It is based on the tactical point that after 7 c2 f5 (D) White is unable to chase back the knight immediately. The reason is that 8 f3? fails to 8.., h4+. He will either have to accept the presence of the black knight on e4 for the time being and make

Strange as it may seem, this move is actually as stem a test of 4 Qc2 as any of the more direct moves that we have just been looking at. Since
5 e4 is not to be feared (Black could then, for in-
stance. strike back in the centre with 5...d5 6 e5 •2Be4 7 Jld3 c5) and the neutral developing moves 5 ?jf3 and 5 Jlg5 can both be met by

vourable version of a 4...c5 line, White more or less has to 'carry out his threat', viz.: VlMZO-lNDlAN DEFENCE 65 Theory's first impression was that 8 e3 d6 9 f3 is the best set-up, but in the early 1980s
9...<c3bd7 10 Ad3 c5 1 1 ?le2 Sc8 turned out to
be a satisfactory answer. The threats against c4 hamper White's attempts to make his bishop- pair felt. Because simple moves like 8 Nf3 d6 9 e3 *2hbd7 10 iLe2 were also unable to cause much damage, 4,..O-O was considered totally safe and sound in those days. But problems started when during the 1990s White, led by Kasparov, began to investigate the much sharper move 8 f3 (D). -.he battle for control over e4 a long-term one

7 Ng5
If White refrains from making this aggres- sive move and prefers the more modest 7 f3 Xb7 8 e3 instead, the position resembles the above line 6...Ne4 7 Rc2 f5 8 $3f3 and play will develop along similar lines. Black will be able to finish his development quite comfort- ably; e.g., 8...d6 9 Ne2 Qbd7 10 O-O >Se4 11 >c2 f5. taking a firm grip on e4. This makes it difficult for White to become active and he will have to be careful not to allow his opponent to build up an attack on the kingside. 7 ... Nb7 (D) This is the obvious move and it is certainly very logical, but it is not the only one. In the first place, Black may also consider directing his attention towards not the e4-square, but the c4-pawn, and thus play 7...Jla6. After 8 e3 d6 9 Bd3 Nbd7 10'Ne2c5 followed by 1 l...Sc8 the white pawn comes under serious pressure. Secondly, the immediate 7...c5 is also not bad. After 8 dxc5 bxc5 Black does not need to worry about Bxf6. He can try to develop an at- tack along the b-file with moves like ...5k6, ...2b8 and ...Rb6 or..>a5. It is from this position that most of the 4 Rc2 O-O variations start. It soon transpired that White can permit him- self the luxury of occupying the centre without completing his development first since after
8...d6 9 e4 Black is unable to take advantage of
his lead in development. An alternative would be to play 8...c5, analogous to 7...c5, but with the bishop already committed to b7 this did not seem to be the perfect solution either.
66 FUNDAMENTAL CHESS OPENINGS
Things were looking fairly bleak from Black's point of view until finally a narrow and only just passable path was discovered: 8...h6 9 Bh4 d5. White's most dangerous reaction to this turned out to be 10 e3 Nbd7 1 1 cxd5 (D). that it has become fixed. Evaluations will al- ways remain open to modification, however subtle. A good variation is never finished and will always be influenced by new insights, new ideas, new experiments. Now H...exd5 may look solid, but this puts very little pressure on White and allows him to complete his development with excellent pros- pects of turning his bishop-pair to good use in the long run (12 Ad3). But the surprising move 1 1 ,.. xd5 saves the day. Suddenly Black's lead in development does make a difference. The endgame after 12 Bxd8 <21X03 is about equal because 13 Jlxc7 is met by 13.,.<2)d5, and now- either 14 jld6 xe3! or 14 Jlf4 2fd8 intending ...g5 (this is the reason why 8...h6 is an essential clement of this plan).

Historically speaking, this is the main line of the Nimzo-Indian Defence. Over a period of more than half a century, dozens of variations have been developed from this position and found their way into the books. The result is that, if you look at these books, the impression is created that theory is much more comprehensive here than it is in the 4 Qc2 variations. But comprehensive does not mean Now it is up to Black to define the further course of developments. He has a choice of sev- eral moves, which are all perfectly sound.

5 J.d3
This looks like the natural developing move in this position and that is just what it is, but White has a major alternative in 5 Ne2 (D). The idea is to play 6 a3 and, if Black then takes on c3, to take back with the knight. Thus after 5... Lb7 6 a3, if Black replies 6...,Nxc3+ 7 <?Jxc3. White has solved the 'Nimzo-Indian Problem', the pin against the c3-knight, in the most elegant way imaginable. Black has tried several ways to try to thwart this plan, all pro- ducing unclear but lively play. To begin with,
6...Jte7 is an original idea, based on the as-
sumption that White's knight is looking rather silly on e2 if it cannot proceed to c3 as planned.

All that has remained from the two bishops is one unimpressive bishop on cl, hemmed in by its own pawns. Protecting c4 by

the pressure on c4 by playing 8...O-O 9 Jle2 ?3c6 followed by ...<2)a5, trying to force the ex- change on d5 anyw'ay. 5 ... -&.b7 6 4bf3 O-O Usually the opening battle in this variation is about control over e4. Besides the neutral 6...O-O the more direct 6...|21e4 also serves this pur- pose. Black creates threats and frees the way for his f-pawn. A voluntary exchange on c3 (i.e. without waiting for White to play a3) fits into this plan. After 7 Q=2 f5 8 O-O Axc3 9 bxc3 O-O a difficult strategic struggle lies ahead. White will have to make an effort to dislodge the knight from c4, starting, for instance, with 10 Nd2 or 10 €)el followed by f3. A trap to look out for is 10 41d2 Rh4 1 1 g3?l (1 1 f3 is better)
11...£jg5! 12gxh4?? 5)h3#I
7 O-O (D)
Now the road branches out. Exchanging on c3 voluntarily is still possi- ble, but not as popular (or as accurate) as in the
6...'2)e4 line, mentioned above. After 7...Jlxc3
8 bxc3 <2)e4 White does not need to lose a tempo protecting his pawn on c3. Instead of 9 Qc2 he can play 9 <k)el at once, when 9...'5hxc3?? loses apiece to 10 Rc2. _____ A much better idea is to play 7...c5, when conventional moves like 8 a3 (8... .xc3 9 bxc3 <2)e4) or 8 Nd2 (8...cxd4 9 exd4 d5) yield White next to nothing. Only the unorthodox 8 $)a4 has managed to pose Black some problems. The point of this knight sortie is that after
8...cxd4 9 exd4 d5 White now has 10 c5!, which
not only creates a dangerous passed pawn but also embarrasses the Nimzo-Indian bishop. For this reason Black usually postpones ...d5 and voluntarily retreats the bishop first by playing either 9...Jie7 or9...Se8 10 a3 jLf8. Now ...d5 is a positional threat w'hich is difficult to assess and which gives this variation its distinct and rather tense character. Black often plays ...d6 (and perhaps ...<2)bd7 and ...2c8) before lash- ing out with ...d5 at a later stage, preferably in a situation where White no longer has the option of replying c5. In comparison. Black's second main line.
7...d5 (D), is strategically uncomplicated.

Black now has the option of retreating his bishop to d6 if necessary, for instance if White plays 8 a3. After 8...jLd6 9 b4 Black has 9...dxc4 10 atxc4 a5 (or the immediate 10...<£jbd7) 1 1 b5

tre with ...e5. To avoid this, most players prefer to fix the central pawn-formation immediately by play- ing 8 cxd5. After 8...exd5 White then has two fundamentally different plans: One is to try to build up an attack on the kingside, starting with 9 <2Be5. To this, Black's accepted reply is 9...Jld6 10 f4 c5, when a dy- namic equilibrium is reached between White's attacking chances on the kingside and Black's in the centre and on the queenside. The other plan is more modest and generally leads to quieter play: 9 a3 -kd6 10 b4. Never- theless this loo may well lead to a tense struggle eventually, especially if Black plays the intimi- dating ,.. e4 with an eye to taking the initiative on the kingside. 4e3 c5 4 ... c5 (D) sharper and is (usually) played with a more concrete aim in mind. Theory has always found it very hard to choose between these two moves and indeed most players seem to regard it as mainly a matter of taste. It could be said though, that with 5 Ne2 White wants to dictate the course of the game himself, while with 5 Jld3 he lets his opponent choose a type of middle- game. The most important response to 5 <2)e2 is 5,..cxd4. After 6 exd4 (D) Black then has two rather different options. These are the straightforward 6...d5 and the more laid-back 6...O-O, In both these lines, drop- ping the Nimzo-Indian bishop back to e7 if White plays 7 a3 has become a standard ploy (but not forced!) to saddle White with the same problem as we saw in the 4...b6 5 '?3e2 line: what should he do with the knight on e2 if the plan a3 Axc3+ <R3x03 is side-stepped? The main lines start with 6...d5 7 c5 and 6...O-O 7 a3 ,i.e7 8 d5. With his last move White stops his opponent from playing ...d5 (which could fol- low, for instance, after 8 €)f4). After 8...exd5 9 cxd5 3e8 (or 9...Ac5) this leads to a hotly- debated key theoretical position. 5 ... €lc6 (D) In connection with Black's next move, this gives the variation 4...c5 a face of its own. The alternatives 5...d5 and 5...O-O are by no means bad. but they transpose to those variations that may also be reached via 4...O-O and are treated under that heading. 6 With this move, Black takes up the struggle for control of the centre in a very' different way. Yet there are certain similarities between this move and 4...b6. For instance, White now faces the same choice between 5 Js.d3 and 5 Ne2.
5 J.d3
This move is aimed at natural, uncompli- cated development. The alternative 5 Ne2 is NlMZO-lNDlAN DEFENCE 69 Many players prefer 6 4t)e2 here, in order to be better prepared for the forthcoming exchange on c3. The idea is not so much to take back on c3 with the knight (as is the idea of play ing 4k 2 a move earlier!) should Black play 6...jtxc3+, because that would just leave the pawn on d4 undefended, but that the knight is better placed on e2 than on f3 in the position arising after 7 bxc3. In this type of middlegame it is of vital importance for White to be able to use his f- pawn, either by playing f3 or f4, which is of course much easier if there is no knight stand- ing in the way. But for another type of middlegame the knight is less well placed on e2: the typical Iso- lated Queen's Pawn position arising after 6 4k2 cxd4 7 exd4 d5 with the exchange ...dxc4 to follow. Of course, this position is perfectly playable for White (and indeed 6 4u)e2 was all the rage around 1990), but it is undeniable that a knight on e2 is less influential on the kingside than a knight on f3. and that it does not cover the important e5-square. This makes the choice between 6 -2Bf3 and 6 Ne2 (again) to a large ex- tent a matter of taste. The question is: which central pawn-formation does White prefer? 6 ... Jixc3+ This is the Hiibner Variation, one of Black's most solid options against 4 e3 and one of the few lines where taking on c3 without waiting for White to play a3 first is completely ac- cepted. 7 bxc3 d6 (D) This is the same type of position that we have already seen in the Samisch Variation. White has economized on a3, but his knight on f3 blocks the f-pawn. As a result White experi- ences some difficulties in taking the initiative on the kingside as we saw him do in the Samisch. In the meantime Black is ready to play ...e5, taking the initiative himself. The way in which White resolves to tackle these problems will define the further course of the opening. The classical approach is 8 e4 e5 9 d5. White fixes the central pawn-formation and hopes to build up a slow-burning attack on the kingside. Practice has shown, however, that after 9..,4Be7 Black's chances of doing just that for himself are by no means inferior. This has caused White to look for more subtle measures. Especially 8 O-O has been investigated very' deeply. If now
8...e5, instead of closing the centre immedi-
ately he plays either 9 €)d2 or 9 4)g5. White does not worry about the prospect of losing a pawn on d4 and plans f4 in both cases. The problems facing Black are of a more complex nature here than after 8 e4, yet in practice here too Black has done well.

5 Ad3
Whereas the difference between 5 Jld3 and 5 <9\e2 is more or less a matter of taste after both
4...b6 and 4...c5, 5 Ne2 in this position is not
nearly as popular. The difference is that Black now has the reply 5...d5 6 a3 Ae7, turning the
70 FUNDAMENTAL CHESS OPENINGS
opening into a kind of Queen's Gambit De- clined where the moves e3 and Qe2 compare rather poorly with the active moves Ag5 and <53f3 of the 'real' Queen's Gambit. 5 ... d5 The alternative 5...c5 usually leads to the same position, especially if White simply con- tinues 6 43f3. In case he prefers 6 <23e2, then
6...cxd4 7 exd4 d5. a strategy that we have al-
ready seen in the 4...c5 5 Bd3 <Sc6 6 Q3e2 vari- ation, is a good reply. 6 <2)f3 Here too 6 is a perfectly valid alterna- tive. Black then has two well-reasoned standard responses in 6...c5 and 6...dxc4 7 jlxc4 c5, but in this particular case he could also try the much wilder 6...e5!?, based on the tactical point 7 dxe5 dxc4 8 .xc4 Wxdl+ 9 xdl l$3g4. 6 ... c5 This very natural move is by far the most popular one, but Black has also tried the unor- thodox 6...A)c6, It may look rather crazy to block your own c-pawn in this variation, but there is a very sound idea behind it: Black is preparing to strike out in the centre with ...e5. After 7 O-O he may set this plan in motion with
7.. .dxc4 8 Bxc4 Jcd6. when he is just in time to
meet 9 e4 with 9...e5. It is not at all easy for White to find an antidote against this original plan and 6...?3c6 has known several periods of popularity, especially in the 1950s and 1960s.
7 O-O (D)
This is one of the most important and deeply analysed positions in the entire Nimzo-Indian. In practice it has occurred in thousands of games and between about 1950 and 1970 the term Nimzo-Indian was almost synonymous with this position. This huge popularity is based on a wealth of variations and subvariations, which are attrac- tive for both sides. Careful study of these is certain to pay dividends, both in immediate practical results and in one's overall under- standing of the game. In fact almost every possible plan has been tried and each one of those has at one time or an- other been overhauled, refined and modernized. First it is Black's move. Which type of mid- dlegame does he choose? The strategically simplest option is to define the central pawn-formation immediately with a double pawn exchange: 7...cxd4 8 exd4 dxc4
9 Bxc4 Black has chosen to play against the
isolated queen's pawn. But handling this varia- tion well is not so simple. 9...b6 (D) is consid- ered the most reliable follow-up.
NIMZO-INDIAN DEFENCE 71
This is the Karpov Variation, Black puts his bishop on b7 and does not immediately decide between developing his queen's knight to d7 or to c6. Also the decision of what to do with the Nimzo-Indian bishop (taking on c3 or retreat- ing?) is left open for the moment. White will have to make optimal use of the many open files and diagonals that the double exchange in the centre has given him. A good move is 10 aLg5, followed (if Black plays 10...Bb7) by 1 1 Zel or 11 Scl. If Black is interested in this type of middle- game but does not want to allow ,Ng5. he might consider taking on c4 only, postponing ...cxd4 until a more convenient moment. This brings us to the variation 7...dxc4 8 Bxc4 b6 (D). 2dl allowing IO...cxd4 II exd4 ±b7 and a transposition to the Karpov Variation or he will try to refute Black's set-up with the sharp 10 d5. This move seems attractive because the meek

ter 1 1 Nxd5 2Bxd5 1 2 i.xd5 Eb8 1 3 e4, but it is actually very double-edged because Black has the much more critical reply 10...Bxc3 1 1 dxe6 Ne5!, when 12 exf7+ Nh8 13 bxc3 Bg4 gives Black a dangerous initiative for the sacrificed pawns, though exactly how dangerous is a ques- tion still unanswered. Finally, Black may decide to leave the cen- tral tension unresolved for the moment, for in- stance by playing 7...Nc6. The only move which is then considered critical is 8 a3, when

the ultra-subtle 9 a3, intending to meet 9...cxd4 with 10 axb4 dxc3 1 1 's xd8 Sxd8 12 bxc3. Thanks to the pair of bishops this endgame is considered to favour White, if only slightly. This brings us to the next variation, 7...dxc4 8 aLxc4 ?3bd7 (D), which is basically an at- tempt to avoid even this little problem. Now 9 a3 cxd4 10 axb4 dxc3 11 bxc3 may lead to the same pawn-structure, but with the queens still on the board the situation is totally different: Black gets counterplay on the queen- side, starling with 1 l..,Rc7, Here it is 9 Qe2 which has become the main line. After 9...b6 White will either just play 10 Looking at the static features of this posi- tion, one might be inclined to favour White. He

has the bishop-pair and a pawn-majority in the centre. Taking on d4 is no longer attractive for Black as White will now be able to take back with a c-pawn, which only increases the strength of his pawn-centre. But when we investigate the situation more carefully, we discover an excellent plan for Black, which highlights the more dynamic fea- tures of the position: 9...dxc4 10 ,Nxc4 Rc7!. Black is ready to take over the initiative in the centre with ...e5, a move that will also awaken his only remaining dormant piece, the bishop on c8. How should White react to this threat and how should he awaken his own dormant bishop on cl? Many different answers have been suggested to these questions, but no defi- nite conclusion has ever been reached, though in practice 1 1 ald3 e5 12 c2 2e8 13 dxe5 Nxe5 14 €Bxe5 Rxe5 15 f3 has become some- thing of a main line. White hopes to consolidate his position with e4 and jLe3. An attempt to refine this plan may be made by playing 9...Qc7 first, with the intention of exchanging on c4 one move later (for instance after 10 jLb2). The only useful attempt to thwart this plan is to play 10 cxd5 exd5. This is in ef- fect the same type of middlegame that we have seen in the Samisch Variation, but with a knight on f3 White will not find it easy to achieve the essential e4 breakthrough; e.g., 1 1 a4 2e8 12 Aa3 c4 1 3 Nc2 Ne4 with a firm grip on e4.

This advance is the point but also the nece: sary consequence of 4 Lg5. After 6 e3 cxd4 cxd4 Ra5 8 i$c2 <2Bc4 White's bishop woul only be sorely missed on the queenside. In reply to 6 d5, Black has an aggressive ta< tical option and a solid positional one. The tactical option is 6...1)5, an assault o White's pawn-centre based on the pawn sacr fice 7 dxe6 fxe6 8 cxb5 which gives Black good many open files and a pawn-majority i the centre in return for his pawn. This is dange: ous ground for both players requiring good ca culating skills and a feeling for dynamic play The positional method is 6...Jlxc3+ 7 bxc d6 or 6...d6 7 e3 Axc3+ 8 bxc3 e5, aiming fc the same pawn-structure as in the Hiibner Var ation. Black has no pawn weaknesses and n NlMZO-lNDlAN DEFENCE 73 move', e4. For decades this almost naively straightforward approach was looked upon with suspicion, especially because White robs him- self of the natural square f3 for his king's knight. But during an outbreak of unheard-of popular- ity around 1990 all the pros and cons of 4 f3 were thoroughly investigated and by now the theoretical situation has cleared up. In fact 4 f3 is now often used as a kind of par- allel road to the Samisch Variation by players who are aiming for one particular subvariation of the Samisch and who prefer the side streets of the 4 f3 road to those of 4 a3. 4 ... d5 (D) Black does well to react to White's plans in the centre immediately. The main alternative to the text is 4...c5, but it is precisely here that the 1990 thunderstorm has caused considerable damage. It was previously thought that after 5 d5 the sharp variations 5... .xc3+ 6 bxc3 Ra5 and 5...Qh5 were both quite well playable but they are now regarded as slightly dubious. A third option, 5...b5, has also turned out to be fairly innocuous because of the laconic reply 6 e4. immediate tactical problems to worry about. Middlegame play will be practically restricted to the kingside, where neither player will find it easy to take the initiative. So whoever wants to play 4 J .g5 will have to feel comfortable both with the strategic difficul- ties of 6..Bxc3+ (or 6...d6 which is just a trans- position of moves in most cases) and with the tactical turmoil of 6...b5. This makes 4 Bg5 a variation for players with a truly universal style, which is exactly what the two great champions who have made this variation popular. Boris Spassky and Jan Timman. were renowned for. 4f3
4 f3 (D)
5 a3 Only this move can justify 4 f3. The struggle for e4 must be continued. Now 5...Nxc3+ 6 bxc3 c5 transposes to a line of the Samisch (see page 59). This is in fact the key test of 4 f3. The alternative 5...Be7 is provocative be- cause it allows White to carry out his plan and play 6 e4. A proper assessment of this position This is perhaps White's most radical way of meeting the Nimzo-Indian Defence. Without further ado he prepares to play 'the perfect

4 4f)f3 was never a popular move until Kas- parov rejuvenated it in his match for the world championship against Karpov in 1985. What their games clearly indicated is that all sorts of ambitious replies to 4 £rf3 are risky'. There is no refutation of this move, so Black does well to treat it with the same respect as the older varia- tions of the Nitnzo-Indian. It then turns out that 4 -5nf3 has in fact little significance of its own because, depending on Black's reply, it is bound to transpose to other variations. This does of course demand a cer- tain knowledge and appreciation of these other variations, which implies that 4 Nf3 is an inter- esting option for those who want to play some particular variations of the 4 e3 or 4 g3 lines, while wishing to avoid others. To begin with, 4...d5 takes us straight into the Ragozin Variation of the Queen's Gambit Declined (see page 21). The Queen's Indian Defence is also just one move away. 4...b6. To complicate transpositional matters even further, both these options allow White to re- turn to a 4 e3 Nimzo-Indian by playing 5 e3. The only moderately popular independent reply to 4 £tf3 is 4...O-O, but this is not rated very highly because of 5 J-g5 c5 6 e3 (D), which is much better for White than the related variation 4 J5tg5 h6 5 Jih4 c5 6 e3. depends on the sharp reply 6...d.xe4 7 fxe4 e5 8 d5 (D). White has gained considerable space in the centre but he has had to make himself vulnera- ble to dangerous counterattacks to achieve this. Critical is 8..Bc5 9 Nf3 •2Bg4, but although White certainly needs nerves of steel here, this is considered rather dubious nowadays because of the bold 10 Qa4. 4&f3 4 an (D) This sound developing move may well be viewed with a sigh of relief by many readers af- ter all the subtle and ambitious lines that we have looked at so far. Others may suffer from the opposite effect and look upon this move as strangely unpretentious. The difference is that 6...Q'a5 can now be an- swered by the sharp 7 Bxf6 .xc3+ 8 bxc3 Rxc3+ 9 $ k!2 or even 7 Ad3 Bxc3+ 8 bxc3 #xc3+ 9 <S?fl, when in both cases White has

excellent chances of launching an attack against the enemy king. The most popular reply to 4 S)f3 is 4...c5. when 5 g3 will bring us to the next section, on the 4 g3 variation. White has then avoided the line 4 g3 O-O 5 J".g2 d5 so he has reduced Black's options. For anyone appreciative of these subtle- ties, 4 <2}f3 may be a very useful move. 4g3

ful against this line as well in 1985, and the theory of this line has more or less petered out into the modest variation 7...Nxd2 8 Qxd2 cxd4, with perhaps a slight advantage to White but nothing very threatening. Less adventurous is 5...b6 6 Jlg2 Bb7. when after 7 O-O Black may either go for a Hedgehog type of position starting with 7...cxd4 (we shall look at the general aspects of the Hedgehog System in the chapter on the Symmetrical Eng- lish) or he may prefer a solution in a more typi- cal Nimzo-Indian style: 7...Axc3 8 bxc3 d6.

After 9 Ad2, for instance, it is not clear whether Black should take on c3 with the knight or with the bishop, while after 9 b3 it is extremely unusual to take on c3 at all.

Queen's Indian Defence
3 c3 and the Nimzo-Indian completely (for
some time). Since then, almost every top grandmaster has played the Queen's Indian, often with both colours, and they have all contributed some- thing to the rapid development of dynamic and challenging variations offering rich potential rewards for both White and Black. As a result, theory of the Queen's Indian has become almost as complex as that of the Nimzo, and unlike forty years ago some knowledge of variations is now essential if you want to play this opening. White's most important method was and still is 4 g3. By putting his king's bishop on g2, White takes up the challenge of fighting for control over the important hl-a8 diagonal and over the central squares e4 and d5. Although it may not look very to the point at first sight, 4 a3 takes up this challenge as well. White wants to play the natural develop- ing move <2)c3 without being disturbed by the Nimzo-Indian pin ...Ji.b4. This amazingly la- conic little move was first used by Tigran Petro- sian and later by Kasparov to surprisingly good effect. The games of Kasparov in particular proved that, far from being a waste of time, 4 a3 is the vital starting move of an extremely aggres- sive strategy that caused Black quite a headache during the 1980s. Strangely enough, 4 4bc3, although it is in fact the most natural move, was used by Kaspa- rov as an even subtler starting move of this, 'his' aggressive strategy. By starting his plan with 4 Nc3.

3 <23f3 b6 (D) For a long time, playing the Queen's Indian with either colour was regarded as a sign of peacefulness. After all, by playing 3 ?3f3 White avoids the complications of the Nimzo-Indian Defence, whereas Black, by not transposing to the Queen's Gambit Declined via 3...d5, avoids a confrontation in the centre. In fact the term •Queen's Indian' used to be almost synony- mous with 'avoiding a fight'. In some books it has even been called a 'drawish' opening. For those who only started playing chess af- ter about 1980 and have consequently not lived through this 'anti-Queen's Indian' era, it will be hard to understand that such an attitude to- wards this opening ever existed. But it was only when Garry Kasparov made his way to the top in the early 1980s, using the move 3 4hf3 to extremely good effect and creating a whole new world of variations in the Queen's Indian, that this attitude changed. Kasparov forged the variations 4 a3, 4 <2)c3 Jfb4 5 Xg5 and (to a lesser extent) 4 g3 into new and very dangerous weapons and suddenly this became one of the most popular openings, superseding

In fact he even has a third option: 4...Ab4+

spark off a fierce struggle right away, yet the re- sulting middlegame positions are often very' tense and full of promise of a fascinating fight. Finally there are the moves 4 _S.f4 and 4 JLgS to be mentioned, but these are relatively unbur- dened with theoretical baggage. Although 4 3Lf4 caused quite a stir for a short period of time in the late 1970s it has be- come clear that this move does little to make life difficult for Black after 4...J.b7 5 e3 Jle7 6 h3 (6 Nc3 allows 6...Nh5, eliminating the bishop) 6...c5. 4 3lg5 too has had its devotees, but it is gen- erally regarded as equally harmless. The simple reply 4..jLb7 5 e3 Jle7 (a crucial difference from the line 4 Nc3 Jlb4 5 Jlg5, mentioned above) 6 <2?Bc3 <?3e4, leads to exchanges and a lessening of tension. 4g3
4 g3 (D)
This Bogo-Indian check plays an important part in all variations of the 4 g3 line, a clear in- dication of how closely related the Nimzo-, Queen's and Bogo-Indian Defences really are, but at this moment it only has independent sig- nificance if Black wants to play the provocative and highly experimental line 4...Jlb44- 5 Jcd2 a5 6 ±g2 Jla6. In case of 5...J.xd2-t- 6 Rxd2 Ab7 7 jLg2 we enter the territory of the more 'civi- lized' variation 4...Bb7 5 Lg2 Bb4+, which we shall look at below.
4 g3 .b7
4 ... Nb7
5 Bg2 Ne7
This is the classical response to 4 g3, but
5...Bb4+ is a solid alternative. White then faces
a fundamental choice between 6 Nc3, 6 Nbd2 and 6 ±d2. 6 'SlcS is a Nimzo-Indian variety that is gen- erally regarded as less promising for White than the 'real' Nimzo-Indian and is not played very often.
6 Nbd2 is also quite rare, but there seems to
be no concrete reason for this lack of popular- ity, because Black has nothing better than a fairly neutral reply like 6...O-O 7 O-O d5. In all probability, most players simply prefer their This move has constituted White's main line ever since the very first days of the Queen's In- dian. During about three quarters of a century, it has been investigated in great detail, yet it still offers plenty of scope for new discoveries. Just as in the Nimzo-Indian, Black has several plans at his disposal for tackling White's cen- tral position. Moreover, these plans can be exe- cuted in several different ways. White usually has a choice between a shaip and a more self- restrained approach to these variations. Which is objectively best is often impossible to say.
QUEEN'S INDIAN DEFENCE 79
queen's knight to be on c3 in this type of posi- tion, where it exerts some pressure on d5. Also of course a knight on d2 always hinders the rapid development of ±e cl -bishop. By far the best studied move is 6 Jcd2 (D). Black then has a large number of variations at his disposal, all varying greatly in character. is highly typical of the Queen's Indian and we are about to see it in several other variations. Whereas 6...a5 is logical and quite under- standable from a classical positional point of view. 6...c5 seemed very hard to swallow when it was first played around 1985. Here too Black accepts doubled pawns, but in this case (7 .fi.xb4 cxb4) the capture is not towards the cen- tre but away from it which, at first sight at least, seems totally wrong. Nevertheless this plan has served Black very well in practice and today it can be found in many different forms in both the Queen's and the Bogo-Indian. Black's posi- tion is very flexible. He can attack the white centre with ...d6 followed by ...c5 or with ...d5, while White cannot really do all that much with his central pawn-majority. Finally, 6... .e7 (D) is also a good move. vv The oldest and simplest is 6...Jlxd2+ 7 Qxd2 (White again prefers the c3-square for this knight, so the perhaps rather more obvious move 7 Nbxd2 is usually avoided) 7...O-O. Al- though this is a fairly quiet position, it is not without danger. For instance, White may opt for 8 Nc3 Ne4 9 W'2 with the treacherous point 9...?)xc3 10 <2)g5! winning the exchange. However, it is actually quite unclear whether this is good for White because Black gets fair compensation for the material deficit after both
10..>xg5 11 i.xb7 xe2 12 Rxe2 4V6 13
Axa8 Exa8 and 10...2)e4 11 i.xe4 Nxe4 12 Rxe4 Rxg5 13 Rxa8 Nc6. The latter variation was the subject of heated theoretical discussion back in the days of Capablanca and Euwe. It still is. A totally different idea lies behind the mod- ern move 6...a5. Black is hoping for 7 Jtxb4 axb4, which would give him an open a-file for his rook and good control over the centre. White does well to avoid this. One critical line is 7 O-O O-O 8 Jlf4, which practically forces Black to retreat his bishop because of the threat of 9 c5 followed by 10 a3. After 8... Be7 9 <R2jc3 <?le4 10 Rc2 a characteristic struggle for control over e4 breaks out. This fight for e4 This bishop retreat is a recurring theme in this opening. Black lures the enemy bishop to d2 to prevent White from fianchettoing this bishop and to undermine a plan with the d5 advance, which is an important weapon against 5...Ne7, as we are about to see. With a bishop on d2, White's control over d5 is lessened, which makes 7 O-O O-O 8 d5? exd5 rather pointless. The d5 advance, which cuts off the 'Queen's Indian bishop' on b7 from the battle for e4, is in fact one of the major strategic motifs of the en- tire Queen's Indian. In most cases White will gain considerable space if he manages to con- solidate this outpost. Thus the value of 5...c5, for instance, de- pends entirely on the question "how should one
80 FUNDAMENTAL CHESS OPENINGS
assess 6 d5?". The point is that 6...exd5 is met by 7 Nh4. making use of the unprotected posi- tion of the bishop on b7 to regain the pawn. There are not too many players who have faith in this variation as Black. We now return to 5...ji.e7 (D): allowing White to build up a nice attacking posi- tion with 9 cxd5 Nxd5 10 Nf5 followed by e4. 7 ... 2>e4 (D) This characteristic knight move clears the way for the f-pawn before White is able to take control over c4 by playing 8 Rc2 or 8 Qd3. It also has the advantage of maintaining maximal pawn-structure flexibility. The main alternative is to play 7...d5, a frontal assault on White's pawn-centre which usually results in some heavy-weight posi- tional manoeuvring. Black plans to play ...c5 and is holding ...4'}e4 in reserve. White's most aggressive reaction is 8 Ne5, when the perhaps slightly odd-looking 8...Na6 is actually more accurate than the rather obvious 8...?}bd7, be- cause 9 '*h4 (with the positional threat of play- ing 10 <?2jc6) is now neutralized by 9...Re8.
6 O-O
6 c3 is also often played, not with the idea
of meeting 6...O-O with 7 d5, because that would give Black the opportunity of undermining the outpost on d5 with 7..Bb4!, but in order to play
7 Qc2 or 7 Qd3, gaining control over e4.
The prudent reaction to this plan is 6...£te4 which usually transposes to the line 6 O-O O-O 7 discussed below, but there is one rather important way to turn this into an inde- pendent variation. If White responds to 6...53e4 with 7 jLd2 and Black then plays 7...f5. the characteristic push 8 d5 gains considerably in strength compared with the position where both sides have already castled, because White will not have to worry about 8...Af6 9 Rc2 Bxc3 10 Axc3 exd5(?) now that Black's pawn on g7 is left undefended. These are of course rather subtle considerations which are for the really interested only and are best studied in connec- tion with the main line 6 O-O O-O 7 -2k3 <Be4 8 i.d2.
6 ... O-O (D)
7 Nc3
An interesting alternative, especially for play- ers who like to sacrifice a pawn for the initia- tive. is 7 d5. If 7...exd5 White (again) plays 8 Nh4, when Black has nothing better than 8...c6. This is one of the most important positions of the Queen's Indian Defence. It is also the
QUEEN'S INDIAN DEFENCE 81
mam culprit for the somewhat dubious reputa- tion this opening once 'enjoyed' as being dull or even downright drawish. Innumerable games have been played where
[diagram]
lowed by a few more moves a draw was agreed (sometimes even a pre-arranged one). These games have done a great injustice to this position because apart from 8 5)xe4 (which by the way can also be played with integrity) White has two 'real' main lines which have always been taken very seriously indeed by opening theory. Of these two, 8 Rc2 is the more cautious, but after 8...Nxc3 9 ' xc3 White's control over the central squares e4 and d5 has been consider- ably reduced, which gives Black the chance fi- nally to get 9...c5 in without having to worry about the standard reply d5. A more reserved approach, like 9...f5 followed by ...Af6, ...d6 and ...?)d7, is also not bad. 8 .d2 (D) is a more aggressive and recently much more popular move.
4 g3 Aa6
4 ... Na6 (D) With the rise to fame of this funny-looking move, at first nicknamed the Slipped Bishop Variation but nowadays far too respectable to be treated as flippantly as that, began a transfor- mation of the entire 4 g3 system in the late 1970s which would soon take hold of the classi- cal 4..Bb7 as well. Instead of following the classical strategy of aiming at a harmonious piece development while containing White's pawn-centre. Black seeks to take over the initiative, to attack the white centre pawns and generally to unbalance the position completely. This forces White to take some immediate and far-reaching deci- sions which are not at all easy to judge. When it transpired that this enormously increases the probability of something going wrong for White in the early stages of the game, 4... .a6 quickly superseded 4...jlb7 as the main line. 5 b3 This is the least compromising way of pro- tecting c4 but not the only one. At first 5 Ra4 was thought to be a strong and aggressive way of meeting 4...Na6. but it soon became clear that this is in fact not very forceful at all be- cause it allows Black to reply 5...Nb7 6 jig2c5 without having to worry about 7 d5 (a motif we have seen in the 4...jLb7 variation).
5 Qbd2 (D), on the other hand, has never
been quite as popular as 5 b3 but it is certainly a move to be reckoned with. White concentrates on the battle for the cen- tral squares. His focus is on playing d5 in order to gain space, even if this is at the cost of the pair of bishops. This usually leads to tense and highly complex middlegame positions, espe- cially if Black takes up the challenge and coun- ters aggressively; for instance, 8...JU'6 9 2c 1 c5
10 d5 exd5 1 1 cxd5 <5)xd2 or 8...f5 9 d5 jLf6.
Strategically simpler and perhaps more cau- tious is 8...d5. This has similar aims to the
7...d5 line. Here White usually fixes the pawn-
structure immediately by 9 cxd5.
82 FUNDAMENTAL CHESS OPENINGS
5...d5 is Black's most direct move. He in-
tends to meet 6 Ng2 with 6...dxc4 (D). Of course, a knight on d2 does not exert as much pressure against the centre as a knight on c3, but if White is prepared to play aggres- sively, this move may lead to interesting and complex middlegame positions. The seemingly solid reply 5...Nb7 6 jLg2 c5, which is such a commendable choice against 5 Qa4, now runs into the bold 7 c4! with the very nasty point 7...<Nxe4 8 Ne5, when 8... c3 loses a piece to 9 Qh5! g6 10 Rh3. 7...cxd4 8 e5 Ne4 is a better choice, maintaining a state of dynamic equilibrium. It should be quite clear though that Black needs to play with the utmost accuracy in this line. Likewise, the value of an immediate
5...c5 also depends to a large extent upon the
sharp 6 e4. Black can steer away from these treacherous waters by playing 5...Ab4. He renews the at- tack against c4 and lets further development de- pend upon White's reaction. 6 Qa4 or 6 Qb3 can be met by 6...c5 and on 6 Rc2 he has a solid reply in 6...J.b7 7 Ag2 Ac4. By physically oc- cupying e4 Black, for the time being at least, prevents White from playing e4. As a conse- quence of this plan he will have to give up the bishop-pair after 8 Rb3, but this fits well into this Nimzo-oriented strategy. After 8...Bxd2+
9 Nxd2 O-O 10 O-O d6 followed by 1 1 ...2>bd7 it
will not be easy for White to find weaknesses in Black's compact position. 5 ... Js.b4+ This check, which we have already seen in similar situations, is Black's most solid treat- ment of this line. The alternatives are sharper and tend to lead to extremely complex positions. This allows the response 7 <2\e5 but forces White, if he so continues, to give up castling af- ter 7... .b4+, because 8 .d2?l is dubious in view of 8...cxb3!. After 8 ifl White's position is sufficiently disorganized for Black either to prevent the imminent loss of material or to find satisfactory compensation for it with imagina- tive and very precise play, starting, for instance, with 8...jkd6 or 8... fd7. Black has to know exactly what he is doing though. 6 cxd5 is a more cautious but less dangerous reaction to
5...d5.
5...b5 (D) is an unorthodox move which
equally upsets the balance of power in the cen- tre but in a totally different way. Rather than demanding a great capability for calculating and evaluating dangerous tactics as
QUEEN'S INDIAN DEFENCE 83
Nevertheless, the alternative 6...Bxd2+ is not bad either. After 7 Q'xd2 Black continues
7...c6 8 Bg2 d5. the very same plan which we
are about to see in combination with 6... .e7. But 6...aLe7 is more ambitious: Black really wants to take advantage of the fact that White's bishop on d2 is standing in the way of his other pieces. does 5...d5, this approach poses problems of a purely strategic nature. But these are no less difficult! What should we think, for instance, of the position after 6 cxb5 Bxb5 7 Jcg2? Black leaves the hl-a8 diagonal unguarded and he will have to spend at least another move to re- move his bishop from b5, yet in the meantime, by eliminating the pawn on c4, he has consider- ably weakened White's control over the centre while in the long run he will be able to strike back with both ...d5 and ...c5. This makes 5...b5, much more than the seemingly classical 5...d5, an ideal variation for the positional player, but not for the conventionally positional player. The idea underlying 5...jLb7 is more subtle again. Black switches back to the 4,..jLb7 vari- ation and assumes (or hopes) that White's extra move b3 will actually work against him, an as- sumption which seems hardly realistic at first sight but which is based on the fact that after 6
7 J.g2 c6
Black can play 7...d5 at once if he wants to do so. but 7...c6 is just a little bit more profound, for Black can now recapture on d5 with the c-pawn if necessary. The symmetrical pawn-structure (after 8 €)c3 d5 9 cxd5 cxd5 for instance) with the black bishop on a6 and its counterpart fairly powerless on g2 offers White almost no chances of obtaining an opening advantage. He will have to think of something else.
8 Jfc3
White frees d2 for his knight, so as to pro- tect his pawn on c4. After the routine move 8 O-O, the reply 8...d5 would more or less force White to adopt a set-up involving 9 Qc2 which would allow Black to increase the pressure on c4 by playing 9...52bd7 followed by ...Sc8 and ...c5. 8 ... d5 (D) Now White has a choice of two main lines that have both been very deeply investigated over the years. Perhaps the most obvious one is 9 4)bd2. After 9...<2)bd7 10 O-O O-O Black will then have completed his development and he will be ready to play ...c5. In this situation it is of vital If 8 O-O O-O 9 jLf4, for instance, which I called a critical line in the analogous variation
4...6b7 5 Ng2 Nb4+ 6 Ad2 a5, Black now has
9...a4. This move not only saves the bishop
from being ambushed on b4 but it also hurts White's pawn-formation on the queenside. The loss of a pawn after 10 bxa4 is irrelevant. 6 i.d2 Ne7 (D) It is this characteristic manoeuvre. ..Jlb4- e7, wrongfooting the white bishop, that has made the variation 4...Ba6 so very popular.
84 FUNDAMENTAL CHESS OPENINGS
White prevents ...Jlb4 and by so doing he prepares the 'perfect' developing move Nc3. This variation did not really come under close scrutiny until the 1980s. The split of variations, however, is the same as after 4 g3. Black has the classical reply 4...Jkb7 and the somewhat cheekier 4...Ba6. A third possibility is to change direction and play 4...c5, giving the game a Benoni-like char- acter. At first sight this may look attractive for Black since, after 5 d5, his 'extra' move ...b6 creates the impression of being more useful than White's a3, but this is not really the case and in practice the straightforward 5...exd5 6 cxd5 g6 7 4k3 .g7, analogous to the Modem Benoni, is hardly ever played. It is much more interesting for Black to re- turn to the ...Aa6 motif by playing 5...Jta6, Af- ter 6 c2 a position is reached that we shall take a closer look at in the variation 4... .a6, since the identical situation arises via 4...Jla6 5 Qc2 c5 6 d5.
4 a3 lb7
4 ... i.b7 5 £\c3 d5 The strength of White's knight on c3 makes itself felt. Just as in many lines of the 4 g3 sys- tem, Black now has to take the advance d5 into account. This is why the simple developing move 5...Be7?! is hardly ever played at master level. White replies 6 d5 followed by 7 e4 and obtains a comfortable space advantage. The alternative 5...g6 is more subtle because now Black will at least have his bishop actively placed on the long diagonal in case of 6 d5 Bg7. This is an important and combative varia- tion. Black challenges his opponent to execute his strategic threat and gets ready to fight against White's central position. S...Ne4 is also quite popular but for a com- pletely different reason: this variation is very solid. By exchanging a pair of knights (6 <?3xe4 Bxc4) Black reduces the tension. If White wains to fight for an opening advantage he will have to sustain the struggle for control over e4. This is done either by the quiet 7 e3 followed by 8 .d.3 or by the sharper 7 Nd2. importance for White to play his trump card as soon as possible: e4. This makes the position after 11 Sei c5 12 e4 a veritable starting point, not just of this variation but of a sharp fight for the initiative in the centre. The alternative is slightly more subtle: 9 Ne5. Since Black can hardly allow a white knight to stand unchallenged on this central square, he has to make a backward movement with 9...<Sfd7. The knights are then exchanged and after 10 l?3xd7 "Slxd? 1 1 43d2 O-O 12 O-O White is ready to play e4 while Black still needs another move to prepare ...c5. So it could be said that by play- ing 9 e5 White has gained a tempo at the 'cost' of exchanging a pair of knights. Starting from this position, some very deep and precise variations have been developed. 4 a3
4 a3 (D)
QUEEN'S INDIAN DEFENCE 85
We now return to 5...d5 (D): less thoroughly investigated than 6 cxd5 and require a talent for improvisation (from both players!).
4 a3 Ba6
4 ... Aa6 (D)
IV
In this position the straightforward 6 cxdS is White's most important option. Black is then faced with a fundamental choice between the robust 6...exd5 and the dynamic b.-. xdS. In the former case White will try to put pressure on the enemy position by 7 Ji.f4 or 7 g3, while Black will normally move forward in the centre with ...c5. This variation usually leads to a long-drawn-out struggle for small positional advantages. The alternative 6...Qxd5 on the other hand is likely to ignite a fight for the initiative. White may play 7 Rc2, for instance, aiming at an im- mediate occupation of the centre with 8 e4. This forces Black to react swiftly in order not to drift into a passive position, yet the situation is also potentially dangerous for White, for his broad pawn-front may turn out to be vulnerable if things go wrong. 7...Ae7 8 e4 Cixc3 9 bxc3 O-O 10 .d3 c5 11 O-O is a characteristic fol- low-up, when Black could try 11...Rc8, intend- ing not only to play 12...cxd4 followed by an exchange of queens, but also to meet the plausi- ble reaction 12 Re2 with 12...Aa6. Generally speaking, exchanges are to Black's advantage in this type of position, because White's attack- ing chances are lessened while Black's pros- pects of an advance on the queenside increase. Less direct, but equally well-founded are 6 's?c2 and 6 Jtg5 Jce7 7 Qa4+. The latter varia- tion aims at disorganizing Black's position: ev- ery single way of relieving the check has certain subtle positional disadvantages. These lines arc This unorthodox move has proved a great success against both 4 g3 and 4 a3. It makes it harder for White to 'easily' develop his pieces and it also poses some concrete problems with- out taking undue risks. Nevertheless, the choice between 4...dLb7 and 4...dLa6 is largely a matter of taste. Which type of position do you want to play or which do you want to avoid?
5 Qc2
5 e3 is well met by both 5...C5 and 5...d5,
while 5 Nbd2 (which goes entirely against the spirit of 4 a3) is usually answered by 5...Bb7 6 Qc2 d5. The knight is simply not well-placed on d2. 5 Rb3 is more interesting, because it pre- serves the option of playing Nc3, but 5 Qc2 has the additional advantage of threatening 6 e4. which makes it the most popular move by far. 5 ... Jcb7 Should Black play 5...d5 in this position. White simply plays 6 cxd5 exd5 7 ?)c3, when the knight on c3 will exert considerably more pressure on Black's central position than in the above 5 5ibd2 line. Black usually builds his scheme of develop- ment around the advance ...c5. 5...Ab7 pre- pares this move, yet an immediate 5...c5 is also not bad. The critical reply to this is 6 d5 (D).
86 FUNDAMENTAL CHESS OPENINGS
The point of Black's previous move be- comes clear. Since 7 d5 is now a practically pointless pawn sacrifice. White has to find an- other plan.
7 e4 cxd4
8 <Nxd4 (D) Black can now turn the opening into a kind of Modern Benoni by playing 6...exd5 7 cxd5 g6, a strategy which is much more promising now than in the event of 4...c5 5 d5 exd5 6 cxd5 g6 as mentioned above, since with a black bishop on a6 White cannot play e4 'for free'. He will have to give up the right to castle. Another option for Black is to win material, for White's move 6 d5, natural as it is, does ac- tually involve a pawn sacrifice. Though after
6...exd5 7 cxd5 Black cannot simply play
7...Nxd5??, because of 8 Qe4+ winning a
piece, following 7...Nb7 8 e4 e7 the loss of either e4 or d5 becomes unavoidable. This greedy variation has never been very popular though. White plays 9 jLd3 <<Bxd5 10 O-O, when his lead in development promises full compen- sation for the lost pawn.
6 £V3 (D)
This is the fundamental starting position of most of the 4...jLa6 theory. Though the position may look very good for White optically, it offers Black counter-chances which are not be underestimated. The moves
8...Nc6 and 8...jLc5 immediately reveal a weak-
ness in White's position: his queen is not ide- ally placed on c2. 8,..d6 is also not bad. Black will curl himself up into a Hedgehog-type of position and intends to show up the supposed clumsiness of both a3 and Qc2 in this type of position at a later stage. 4 c3
4 Nc3
An unprejudiced observer will be likely to think this is the most natural move in the world. But to a player who has avoided the Nimzo- Indian just one move ago by playing 3 Nf3 in- stead of 3 €Jc3, this is not self-evident at all. Nevertheless, White has a very good reason for playing this move. If Black now plays 4...Jib7,
5 a3 will bring about the 4 a3 line without
White having been bothered by 4... .a6. But what if Black plays the Nimzo-Indian move?
6 c5 4 Ab4 (D)
QUEEN'S INDIAN DEFENCE 87
Ji.d3 f5 a critical situation is reached. Black's initiative is very threatening indeed and White has to fight back quickly. The move that keeps him in business is 12 d5, a pawn sacrifice dis- rupting Black's pawn-formation. Now it is Black who has to be careful. Accepting the sac- rifice is risky: 12...exd5 13 cxd5 Bxd5 is met by 1 4 Nd4 Qf6 15 f3 and White takes over the initiative. Theory considers 12...?)c5 or even the pawn sacrifice 12...£kl7 to be a better choice. Black's chances in this very compli- cated position lie in his opponent's shattered pawn-formation on the queenside. White hopes to expose the vulnerability of the black king by attacking moves like £k!4 and h4. These complications are not to everyone's taste. Those who prefer a quieter game usually play 7... .xc3+ 8 bxc3 d6, a slower but much more solid variation. White will try to set up a strong pawn-centre by playing 9 £k!2 and per- haps f3 followed by e4. Black will react with ...e5 at some point. White now has the opportunity of turning this into an independent variation by pinning the f6-knight.
5 Ng5
Now that Black has committed himself to a ...b6 set-up, he will not be able to react to this pin in the same way as against 4 Bg5 in the Nimzo-Indian proper (see page 72). 5 ... Nb7
6 e3 h6
7 ±h4 (D) 4 e3 We have arrived at the key position in this line. Black faces a crucial choice. White is practi- cally challenging him to play 7...g5 8 Bg3 <2Be4, which breaks the pin against the f6-knight and at the same time looks like an attractive way to take over the initiative. But in reality this variation makes enormous demands on both players. After 9 B'c2 jLxc3+ 10 bxc3 d6 1 1 This variation is quite different from every- thing we have seen earlier in this chapter. White is in no hurry to start a battle for control over e4 and d5. Instead, he calmly completes his king- side development. This sober attitude forces Black into a similar role. Such a treatment of the opening is of course a highly personal choice. White effectively
88 FUNDAMENTAL CHESS OPENINGS
postpones the start of the battle to the early middlegame, when complicated problems are bound to arise, for behind the following seem- ingly commonplace moves the tension is build- ing. It should not come as a surprise then that 4 e3 has always been a relatively popular varia- tion, even among top grandmasters, but that theory has remained somewhat rudimentary. In a way, the opening is skipped and the players head straight for the middlegame. 4 ... ~ Bb7
5 Nd3 (D)
very- demanding of both players because there arc so many different pawn exchanges, all lead- ing to complex pawn-formations in the centre, most of which are hard to judge. It is this type of situation which is the most characteristic aspect of the 4 e3 line. Black may also decide to head for this line by playing 5...c5 (D) first. In that case he must be prepared for 6 O-O Jle7 7 ?)c3 though, when the simple 7...O-O?! is met very forcefully by 8 d5. The exchange 8...exd5 9 cxd5 <?3xd5 10 Q3xd5 Ji.xd5 1 1 .xh7+ would then be positionally favourable for White.
7...cxd4 8 exd4 d5 is considered to be Black's
best reply, but this too contains some problems. White could decide to start an attack on the kingside with 9 cxd5 Nxd5 10 Ne5 O-O 1 1 Rh5 and although Black should be able, with accu- rate play, to maintain the balance, the mere fact that such accuracy is required is a factor which needs to be taken into account. A well-known trap, illustrating the danger, lies hidden in the position after 1 l...?)f6 12 'Q'h4, when the seem- ingly natural 12...Nc6? 13 Jlg5 g6?? loses on the spot to 14 Jla6!. A better way to develop this knight is I2...£jbd7, while 12...Ne4!? is also possible. tion. Anyone making a study of this line will soon discover for himself one of the reasons why there are few clearly defined variations here: the order of moves is extremely vague. Both sides have certain standard schemes of development but within such a scheme there is hardly ever one particular move-order standing out as best. In the meantime all these uncer- tain move-orders do have their own particular- ities. Perhaps Black's most solid plan is to play
5... jie7 6 O-O O-O 7 <Sc3 d5 (or 5...d5 6 O-O Ne7
7 Nc3 O-O). A plausible continuation is then 8

majority of cases the bishop on b4 will be ex- changed on d2 and whether for a knight or a bishop, some of the pressure which Black often feels in the early stages of most other openings will be relieved. I think it is fair to say that if the opening does not go well for Black, this may lead to disaster in the sharper opening systems, but in the Bogo-lndian (as well as in some other solid openings) the worst that can happen is that Black finds himself in a somewhat passive position: long-term problems instead of short- term ones. Whether this a actually an advantage of the Bogo-lndian is of course a matter of taste and temperament. And if this all sounds as if the Bogo-lndian were unfit to play for a win with the black pieces: that would be a grave misunderstand- ing. There are quite a number of double-edged variations that offer White many opportunities to go wrong, especially in the area of making delicate positional evaluations. A third feature which sets the Bogo-lndian apart is that, despite its recent popularity and the theoretical research this has involved, it still carries relatively little theoretical baggage. In fact this aspect makes itself felt immedi- ately for, apart from a return to the Nimzo- Indian with 4 <2}c3, White has only two main lines: 4 Bd2 and 4 '2ibd2.
4 Bd2
4 Ad2(D)
The most natural reply. Unafraid of possible simplifications, White continues his develop- ment. Black now has several possibilities, dif- fering greatly in character and intention. By far the simplest move is 4...jLxd2+, the preferred choice of Bogoljubow himself and the main line in the early years of the Bogo-lndian. White usually recaptures with the queen so as This move was introduced at the highest '.evel by Efim Bogoljubow (1889-1952) during the 1920s, but it was not until half a century Ater that it matured into a fully-fledged open- :r.g.

From a modem point of view this seems al- most incredible, for we now know that the Bogo-lndian contains not just one but a vast ar- ray of strategic ideas and purposes. To begin ith, what may have looked like a lack of stra- ngle purpose fifty years ago is now regarded as flexibility, which is an attractive feature in itself :? many players.

Should White prefer 5 ?jbxd2, however, a plan based upon ...d6 in combination with ...e5 or ,..c5 is best. The alternative 4...Re7 (D) is slightly more aggressive while also containing a subtle tacti- cal point. This promises a fundamental positional clash between White's space advantage and Black's 'better' bishop (meaning that it is not of the same colour as the fixed pawn-formation in the centre). Black can open hostilities both on the queenside (,..c6) and on the kingside (...f5). This is a very popular variation, illustrative of the fact that the Bogo-Indian is really all about subtle positional judgement. Lovers of wild tactical complications will not feel at ease here (at least not in the opening stage of the game) and for this reason many players use the Bogo as an occasional weapon, hoping to unbalance an opponent who they think might feel uncomfortable in this type of purely posi- tional play. White can opt for a different scenario by choosing 6 l2k3, pre-empting Black's idea of exchanging on d2. However, the nature of the position after 6..Ji.xc3 7 Jlxc3 ?3c4 8 Zc 1 O-O

different.
4...aS also leads to positions which are not
easy to judge. We have seen this motif in the Queen's Indian Defence, to which a direct trans- position is now possible with 5 g3 b6 6 -Jcg2 Ji,b7 (see page 79). Equally well-founded (and about equally popular) are 5...d5 and 5...d6 6 J.g2 "21bd7 7 O-O e5 - another example of the perfect adaptability of the Bogo-Indian to a player's personal style and preferences.

BOGO-lNDIAN DEFENCE 91
Having read the chapter on the Queen's In- dian, it will come as no surprise to the reader that 4...c5 (D) is also an important continua- Clearly the positional problems involved in this dilemma are at least as difficult to judge as the ones we have just seen arising from 4 Bd2. Under what circumstances is taking on d2 the right solution? When is it better to retreat the bishop and how important is it that the white knight will then be on d2 instead of c3? Studying this line carefully and experiment- ing with it in practice will quickly acquaint you with these subtleties and give you an ever- increasing advantage over less-experienced players. Just as in the 4 Bd2 line. Black now has a major decision to make. He has several options. To begin with, 4...c5 (D) is an important move if only because White cannot reply 5 d5. This provocative move is in fact one of Slack's sharpest weapons in this opening, en- tirely in the typical Bogo-Indian way of always creating positional problems rather than tacti- cal ones and of never taking undue risks. After the natural 5 Bxb4 cxb4 6 g3, a direct transposition to the Queen's Indian is again possible with 6...b6 7 Bg2 Jlb7, but practice has shown that a set-up based on 6...O-O 7 Bg2 i6 8 O-O and now either 8...Qtc6 or 8...Ee8, both ith ...e5 in mind, may be an even better choice, ir. this type of position the bishop might well be more useful on the h3-c8 diagonal than on the Queen's Indian diagonal hl-a8. 4 £bd2 4 2)bd2 (D) This move betrays a totally different inter- relation of the situation after 3...Bb4+. White ants to play 5 a3, forcing Black either to retreat .".is bishop or exchange it on d2 for a knight. In the latter case he will be the proud owner of a rair of bishops, without having had to worry _?out complications like doubled pawns (as ould be so after 4 "2)c3). In the former case he ill have gained a tempo (although of course a3 not that spectacular an extra move) and he ill have avoided the simplification of a bishop : .change on d2. Instead 5 a3 is both consistent and critical. After 5...Jlxd2+, for instance 6 ,Nxd2 cxd4 7 i2)xd4 Nc6 leads to a position where White's two bishops cannot be said to yield him a clear
92 FUNDAMENTAL CHESS OPENINGS
makes this variation so interesting. 5 Ra4+ is a subtle attempt to improve on this line. Because the reply 5.,. c6 is forced, Black will not be able to play ...c5 for some time, which would otherwise be a very natural way to fight back in the centre. Still, whether this is actually an 'achievement' remains a matter of opinion.
4...O-O takes this strategy one step further,
for this laconic move allows White, after 5 a3 Jt.e7, to play 6 e4 (D). advantage (yet), but they are still threatening and this may have an intimidating effect on Black, who will have to play accurately. If Black has no objections to taking on d2 he might also consider 4...b6. This is likely to pro- duce a type of middlegame which is very simi- lar to a well-known line of the Nimzo-Indian: 5 a3 Bxd2+ 6 Bxd2 Jib7 7 Ag5 (the Nimzo- Indian close relative being 3 <2k:3 Jlb4 4 Sc2 O-O 5 a3 Bxc3+ 6 Qxc3 b6 - see page 64).
4...d5 (D) is based on a completely different
idea. The idea is to strike back heavily against White's centre pawns, first with 6...d5 and if White replies 7 e5 Nfd7 8 cxd5 exd5 9 -*Ld3 again with 9...c5. Here Black is really trying to make use of the (relatively) passive position of White's knight, because if it were on c3 this would be completely impossible. Nevertheless, this too is an unclear and much-disputed varia- tion. Black prepares to meet 5 a3 with 5...jLe7, without having to worry about 6 e4. This raises the fundamental question outlined above. Has White really gained a tempo or is this compen- sated for by his knight on d2 being less actively placed than it would be on c3? A clear answer is hard to give, which is of course exactly what King's Indian Defence a huge amount of deeply analysed opening the- ory was a mere footnote in the practically un- charted morass of what was called 'irregular openings' in those days. It was not until around 1920 that some promising young players started experimenting with it, most notably perhaps the future world champion Max Euwe. Little by lit- tle, the despised opening gained respectability and even a name: the King's Indian Defence. The decisive impetus came from the Soviet Un- ion, reaching the international arena after World War II. Fantastic games from almost all the great Soviet players of that era (headed perhaps by Bronstein and Boleslavsky) brought to light an inexhaustible source of tactical and strategic new ideas. Both the King's Indian and the Griinfeld were lifted to the very top of the hit parade, where they have flourished ever since. In this chapter we shall look at the King's In- dian Defence, which is not really a name for a particular sequence of opening moves but rather for a scheme of development involving ...<2Bf6, ...g6 and ...Ag7, thus allowing White to play e4. One of the great attractions of this opening is in fact that it is not restricted to a particular sequence of moves and that it can be played against any first move except 1 e4 (although it could be said that the Pirc Defence represents the King's Indian against 1 e4). The Griinfeld Defence, which we shall look at in the next chapter, though equally provoca- tive, is very different in character, for here Black plays ...d5, starting the attack against White's pawn-centre immediately. Once these were just two variations of the same opening, but now they have grown far apart. It is even a rarity these days if a player has both these openings in his repertoire as Black, because they differ so greatly in character. By far the most obvious continuation after
2...g6. is 3 Nc3, in order to prepare (or is it to
threaten?) e4. By playing l...?)f6. Black approaches the opening in a way that is fundamentally different from l...d5. While still turning his attention to the centre and taking control over some impor- tant squares, he as yet does not send his pawns forward. He maintains as flexible a pawn-struc- ture as possible. Now by playing 2...g6 instead of 2...e6, Black takes this strategy one step fur- ther. Whereas 2...e6 prepares ...d5 and opens the way for .. Jlb4, thus continuing the fight for control over e4, 2...g6 signals a complete lack of interest in preventing e4. Black allows his opponent a free hand in the centre, confident i or at least hopeful) that it is exactly this broad pawn-centre that will provide him later on with a beautiful target for a counterattack. In fact, this is not an attempt to maintain equality, as a classical treatment of the opening could be said to be; it is a violent attempt to wrest the initiative from White. It is an un- equivocal challenge - a challenge for a fight to the death. In the early 20th century, the days of glory of the Queen's Gambit Declined, such an approach to the opening was unthinkable and what is now

The second-most important move is 3 g3. Other moves are 3 5Bf3 and 3 f3. 3 Nf3, while a sound enough move in itself, has little independent significance because after 3...Jlg7 White will still have to choose between a set-up involving 4 Nc3 and one based on 4 g3. 3 f3 (D) is controversial. on the kingsidc. but he does not commit him- self. He is keeping his options open. Likewise, the natural developing move 5 £tf3 may lead to unfathomable complications, but as yet no bridges are burned. Both sides may still steer the game into more navigable waters. In fact, this flexible and classical move must be considered the main line of the King's Indian Defence and probably constitutes the most se- vere test of its soundness. 5 jke2 O-O 6 Bg5 is the subtlest approach, al- though like everywhere in this opening here too a sudden explosion into chaos is never far away. This is the Averbakh Variation. Together with the g3 system, these are the main lines of the King's Indian Defence, but be- cause of Black's initial reticence in this opening (meaning that no physical contact with the en- emy forces is made during the first few moves) White has a great variety of moves in the early stage of the game. Practically all of them are good, playable, adequate or at least legal. The moves 5 "?3ge2, 5 Bd3 and 5 h3 in partic- ular are really quite respectable variations with considerably more theoretical background than many a variation of a lesser opening, yet in the context of the hugely popular King's Indian they remain relatively small. 5 4 >ge2 is played with a view' to 6 ?Jg3. 7 Jle2 and 8 O-O, 5 jj.d3 fol- lowed by 6 Nge2 is a variation on the Samisch and 5 h3 prepares 6 Be3 (or 6 .g5 h6 7 Jke3) by eliminating the annoying reply ...Ng4. All of these moves are subtle attempts to im- prove on the main lines. When studying these variations it is essential always to keep in mind If Black replies 3....Ng7, the continuation 4 e4 d6 5 $Jc3 will transpose into a Samisch, a variation that we shall look at later on. If he plays 3...c5 the game turns into a Benoni after 4 d5 Ji.g7 5 c4 d6 6 ftc3 (see page 142). But if Black is not satisfied with either of these trans- positions, if he feels he has to 'punish' the per- haps somewhat clumsy 3 f3, he may want to play 3...d5. This is the Griinfeld approach that will be dealt with in the next chapter. 3<Nc3

This is the most important starting position of the King's Indian Defence. White faces a fundamental choice on how to tackle the situa- tion, a choice which is to a very large extent a matter of taste. Outwardly the most intimidating, strategi- cally a little primitive, yet all in all an important possibility is 5 f4. the Four Pawns Attack. Seemingly less aggressive, but on closer in- spection very sharp indeed, is 5 f3, the Samisch Variation. White prepares a set-up involving -Ne3, Qd2 and O-O 0 followed by a pawn-storm

There are many more schemes of develop- ment for Black, for instance ...c6 in combina- tion with ...a6 intending to play ...b5, and of course it is always possible to find a very spe- cific and non-standard reaction to almost any move by White. All of these strategic motifs will recur in the variations below.

To begin with, White now has to take a decision with far-reaching conse- quences. 7 dxc5 (D) It is truly difficult to say what is best, but certainly White's sharpest and most principled move is 7 d5, reaching a position which is of crucial importance for both the King's Indian and the Benoni. For reasons of systematic clarity, however, I shall discuss this and simi- lar variations with the typical Benoni pawn- formalion in the chapter on the Benoni, except the Averbakh which I regard as predominantly King's Indian.

White has taken the greatest possible advan- tage of the freedom his opponent has allowed him in occupying the centre. Black is now under considerable pressure to launch a counterattack which must be swift, powerful and well-aimed. Decades of practical tests have established that only ...c5 and - to a slightly lesser degree - ...e5 are to be fully trusted in this respect. The ...c5 plan can be executed immediately: 6...c5, The ...e5 plan needs some preparation. Curiously, it is not one of the obvious moves 6...Nbd7 or

In fact it is precisely this quality, this continuous tension between what is and what is not carrying imagination too far, which attracts so many players with a natural dynamic style to the King's Indian Defence.

The diagrammed position is a good case in point. Of course it is not illegal to play 7...dxc5, but Black's position will be drained of all vitality and become rather static and perhaps slightly passive after 8 ,Nd3 -21c6 9 e5. The text-move (7...Ra5), on the other hand, creates the threat of 8...'2Bxe4. Play might con- tinue 8 Bd3 Qxc5 9 Qe2 4hc6 10 fLe3, when Black has a choice between two squares for his queen. Superficially 10...Qh5 looks like the most active move, partly because it invites White to fall into the nasty trap 11 O-O? Ng4 12 Bd2?? <Nd4, but if White calmly responds 1 1 h3, the position of the queen on h5 is shaky. Most players prefer 10...Ra5, when 1 1 O-O can be met by 1 l..Bg4 and 12...<22)d7, starting ac- tive play on the queenside.

This, however, brings to light a very impor- tant point of 6...Na6: 9...-?hc5! increases the pressure on what is left of White's centre. If now, for instance, 10 Qxd8 2xd8 1 1 fLf3 Jle6 followed by 12...Nfd7!, White is in danger of falling behind in development and Black will have more than sufficient compensation for the sacrificed pawn. A more positionally oriented reaction to
7...e5 would be 8 fxeS dxe5 9 d5. By refusing
the sacrifice, White hopes to hold on to the ini- tiative. But because this causes problems with the defence of e4 after 9...<$3c5, attention has gradually shifted to the alternative 7 ".d3. This move is likely to produce, after 7...e5 8 fxe5 d.xe5 9 d5 c6 (or 9...$3h5), a typical King's In- dian battle, revolving around the question: is White's central formation a source of strength or is it the perfect target for Black's counterat- tack? Finally, there is the aggressive reply 7 c5
(D).
The consequences of this advance arc hard to judge, but White should certainly not be working under the assumption that this simply refutes 6...'23a6 and that he is smashing his op- ponent easily. Black replies 7...<2fd7, when he is ready to strike back with 8...c5. If White has nothing better in this position than completing This move is likely to raise a few eyebrows, especially when one is told that the idea is not to prepare ...c5, but ...e5! We are now, indeed, entering hypermodern opening theory, where considerations of a general nature tend to get swept aside by concrete and precisely calculated variations. Black is planning a massive attack in the centre, hoping to take over the initiative at the cost of a pawn. If White now simply replies 7 Jle2. allowing Black to carry out his plan by 7...e5, he will face a difficult choice. He can accept Black's pawn sacrifice in various ways, but a closer inspection

and other top grandmasters since World War II have played the Samisch. For decades, this was considered to be the ultimate weapon against the King's Indian Defence. It was not until the 1990s that Black finally managed to come to terms with it and the Samisch slowly began to give way to other variations, most notably 5 $Jf3. The main objection that can be raised against
5 f3 is that it is not a developing move. White's
pieces are a little slow in joining the battle and Black should try to take advantage of this. Over the years a wide variety of variations have been developed, based not just on the traditional stratagems of ...c5 and ...e5, but on some very- original ideas as well.
5 ... O-O
For almost all of these variations, castling has proved to be a useful preliminary, the only exception being the plan of playing ...c6 and ...a6. where the risk of an enemy attack is thought to outweigh the advantage of complet- ing kingside development.

5 f3 (D)
White consolidates his central position and prepares Jte3. He is also laying the cornerstone for a kingside pawn-storm by g4 and h4-h5. Yet he does not commit himself to this plan. A queenside offensive remains just as realistic an option, when 5 f3 will serve as a precaution against an expected attack on the kingside by Black. This versatility of 5 f3 has held a strong at- traction over the years to players of varying style and personality. Almost all the world champions The Samisch is one of only a few King's In- dian variations where this plan has gained a solid reputation for itself, mainly because Black runs little risk of being pushed back by a swift central advance based on e5.

play 6...e5?, which is punished by 7 dxe5 dxe5 8 'S'xd8 5xd8 9 Nd5. In practice Black has usually replied with a ...c5 plan, which is very logical now that d4 is not as well protected as it is with a bishop on c3. 6...c5 7 d5 is a direct transposition to the Benoni (see page 142), but there are subtle variations on this theme which are hard to evaluate properly, like 6...a6 7 Qd2 c5, when 8 d5 runs into the characteristic pawn sacrifice 8...b5. This is a typical King's In- dian/Benoni motif which will pop up in many different forms, culminating in the Benko Gam- bit (see page 153) where Black starts the game with this pawn sacrifice. We now return to 6 Jle3 (D): than the immediate 7...b5. The position after
7...O-O 8 ge2 b5 9 O-O Qbd7 is characteristic
for this line. White enjoys a space advantage but Black's position is both flexible and solid and it is far from clear how White should pro- ceed. White's most aggressive option is to play 7 Rd2 b5 8 O-O-O, intending Jlh6 and h4-h5. It is precisely to take the sting out of this attacking scheme that Black does well to delay castling in this line. If he continues 8...'s'a5. Black's at- tacking chances on the queenside will be no worse than White's on the opposite wing. Finally, blocking Black's advance on the queenside by playing 7 a4 is also a valid option. Of course this means that White, hampered by his now sterile pawn-structure will no longer be able to make any serious headway on the queen- side. A good reply is 7...a5, securing the 'hole' in White's pawn-structure, followed by ...*2)a6 and ...e5. 6 ±e3 This is the classical interpretation of the Samisch. In the last decade of the 20th century, however, when White was finding it increas- ingly difficult to cope with the many new problems that Black was posing, the search for alternatives, not just for this but for each and every 'self-evident' move in the Samisch, be- came intense and 6 Jtg5 (D) came to the fore, though whether this move is really an improve- ment is still an open question. Starting from this position, an amazing di- versity of variations has been developed, doing full credit to the pent-up strength hidden in Black's seemingly rather withdrawn position. The classical approach is to play 6...e5, when after White's principled reply 7 d5, Black again faces an important choice. His most obvious plan is to lash out on the kingside with 7...4)h5
8 Rd2 f5. If, after 9 O-O-O. Black continues this
strategy of gaining ground by playing 9...f4 10 Xf2, the centre is closed and both sides will have to move forward with their pawns slowly and carefully, White on the queenside and Black on the kingside. It is more flexible (though not necessarily better) to play 9...<Nd7 10 .Id 3 Ndf6, retaining the option of exchanging pawns on e4. though of course this also allows White to take the initiative himself by exchanging on 15. Black has the same range of possible replies that he has against 6 Jle3 except that he cannot

In this position White must be careful not to give Black too much of a free hand on the kingside ( 1 1 O-O f4). Therefore most players exchange pawns on 1'5 before castling ( 1 1 exf5 gxf5 1 2 O-O). The central pawn-formation is now less rigid than in the 7...Nh5 8 Qd2 f5 line and Black will have to be on his guard for counter- aggression on the kingside, most notably based on the powerful thrust g4. Another classical way to tackle the 'Samisch problem' is to play ...c5. This plan can be exe- cuted in several ways. To start with, the immediate 6...c5. strange though it may look, has turned out to be emi- nently playable. At first sight Black's compen- sation is not obvious after 7 dxc5 dxc5 8 Rxd8 Exd8 9 .xc5 5)c6 (D), yet closer investigation reveals that this is actually a beautiful demon- stration of the hidden powers of the King's In- dian Defence. Black has only two minor pieces and two pawns to show for the queen, yet White's posi- tion has been damaged in such a vital way, in particular by the disappearance of his g-pawn and of his dark-squared bishop, that the posi- tional compensation for this material deficit is thought to be sufficient. And this is not a pas- sive variation either! Far from just banking on White being unable to break down his fortress, Black has hopes of taking the initiative himself by means of ...c6 or ...f5. What this variation re- quires - from both players - is not so much a good knowledge of opening theory but courage and, most of all, self-confidence. In addition to 7...Nh5, Black has the possi- bility of playing 7...c6 (D), opening the c-file in anticipation of his opponent castling queen- side. If White now simply carries on with 8 Rd2 cxd5 9 cxd5 a6 10 O-O-O, Black will get coun- terplay on the queenside, based on moves like ...'IS,a5, ...b5 and ...i$)bd7-c5. For this reason, most players take 7...c6 as a signal for White to change plans and castle kingside instead. After 8 Xd3 cxd5 9 cxd5 Black falls back on standard
100 FUNDAMENTAL CHESS OPENINGS
White has difficulties in getting his pieces developed and he would dearly like to neutral- ize the pressure on the long diagonal (al-h8) and plug the hole on d4 by putting his c-pawn back on c3. In fact, many players prefer a switch to the Benoni via 7 d5 or, perhaps slightly more accurate, 7 <2'ige2 £}c6 8 d5 Qe5 9 <zSg3, which transposes to a critical line of the Modern Benoni after 9...e6 10 Be2 exd5 1 1 cxd5 (see page 148). It is partly this line which has caused White to take a closer look at 6 Bg5 because in this Benoni-type position, g5 is the more aggressive square for the bishop. Although it is therefore not strictly necessary to make any preparations for ...c5, many players still prefer to do so. Especially 6". 'Zlbd7 (D) is a popular alternative to 6...c5. move because 7...c5? runs into 8 e5 followed by jLc4. Finally, there is 6...'?3c6 (D), a move based on an entirely different idea. Black's aim is to take the fullest possible advantage of the limita- tions of the Samisch.
A
a& d5 For a start, he does not need to worry about 7 because he can simply reply 7...<2)e5, when White will begin to experience some difficul- ties in developing his kingside, while Black has an easy plan of action on the queenside, based on ...c6. The idea behind 6,..Nc6 is to play 7...a6 and
8...Sb8, getting ready to play either ...b5 or
...e5 (and preferably both!), depending on which scheme of development White chooses. The ideal is to play ...e5 in a situation where d5 can be met by ...Nd4. even if this involves a pawn sacrifice. The rook on b8 will support an attack on the queenside once the b-file is opened, for instance after ...b5 and ...bxc4. This way of tackling the Samisch is much more aggressive than ...a6 in combination with ...c6 and it has been one of the main lines of the Samisch ever since its introduction in the 1960s. The most important starting position is reached after 7 Nge2 a6 8 Rd2 Zb8 (D). If White now plays a calm move like 9 £9Tcl , freeing the diagonal for his bishop on fl, the thematic reply is 9...e5 1 0 d5 Nd4. Then after 11 Nxd4?! exd4, 12 Rxd4? loses to 12...Nxe4!. but even 12 Q3e2 allows Black excellent posi- tional compensation. With all White's centre pawns fixed on light squares and the al-h8 This is mainly a matter of taste. Black avoids the exchange of queens (after 6...c5 7 dxc5) and is aiming for a complicated (probably Benoni- oriented) middlegame. For instance, now 7 vhge2 c5 8 d5 *2)e5 produces the same position as the above-mentioned 6...c5 7 £sge2 •Zteb 8 d5 Ne5. White may want to try to improve on this line by maintaining the tension in the cen- tre with 8 'S'd2. or he may play 7 4bh3 (intend- ing ?)f2), making use of the fact that Black cannot play ...Bxh3, ruining White's pawn- structure, with a knight on d7.
6...b6 is a rather old-fashioned way to prepare
...c5. This line was fairly popular in the 1960s but is now a rare bird. If White plays 7 Jld3 Black will have to make another preparatory

plays 10...Na5 1 1 ?3g3 c5 (a necessary move to prevent b4) 12 h5. White does indeed obtain excellent chances on the kingside. The alter- native 9...b5 too. requires (at least) nerves of steel from Black in view of 10 h5. Black's most solid response to 9 h4 is 9...h5, White then again faces a fundamental choice. He can either fall back on the Ncl plan or proceed with the attack: e.g.. 10 O-O-O b5 1 1 jLh6. 5

diagonal fully at the mercy of the black bishop, the absence of White's dark-squared bishop is making itself felt. But it may well come as a bit of a shock that White is not safe from aggression even if he plays the solid 11 ?3b3. because Black then has another pawn sacrifice to add fuel to the fire: ll...c5 12 dxc6 bxc6! 13 <2jxd4 cxd4
14 Jlxd4. Now after 14...Ne8 (or 14...'i&a5, or
even 14...d5) Black's plan is running like clock- work: he has open lines for his rooks and an open diagonal for his bishop on g7 and White has great difficulty in getting his pieces devel- oped. A much more aggressive approach is to play 9h4(D). The fact that this position is often reached via a different move-order (e.g. 1 43f3 *?)f6 2 c4 g6 or 1 d4 Nf6 2 Nf3) would be more than suf- ficient reason in itself to regard this as a main line, but even in the move-order that we are us- ing here. 5 R3f3 is one of White's most impor- tant moves. He develops his king's knight and as yet does not commit himself to any particular pawn-formation.
5 ... O-O
6 SLe2
Again White makes a natural move, devel- oping the bishop without committing himself, but the alternative 6 h3 (preparing Jte3) is also quite popular. If Black responds in classical style with 6...e5, the idea is to play 7 d5, when after 7...2)bd7 8 i.e3 Sk5 White has 9 d2 and if now 9...a5 (strengthening the position of the knight on c5 by preventing 10 b4), the bold
10 g4 reveals White's intentions: he is anticipat-
ing the thematic advance ...f5. If Black carries li White is trying to get his attack in first. If Black plays 9...e5 now, the situation after 10 d5 is totally different. Because White has not moved his knight from e2, 10... 3d4 essen- tially just loses a pawn here, while if Black

structure will be unavoidable. If, for instance,
11 Jle2 ilxc3 12 bxc3 e5! White's position has
lost much of its dynamic power. Most players prefer to anticipate this attack by preventive measures like 8 Sc! or the surprising regroup- ing 8 Jkxe2 9 Qgxc2. We now return to 6...c5 (D): Black is seeking a transposition to the Ben- ti via 7 d5 (see page 142). However, he has to ke another transposition into account, one at is much more surprising and which may >l be entirely to his liking: after 7 O-O cxd4 8 Bxd4 *2)c6 9 Jcc3 we suddenly find ourselves the Maroczy Bind, a line of the Sicilian Ac- derated Dragon (see page 420)!
6...Ng4 (D). however, is an interesting and

The logical 7 .e3, strengthening 1, is generally considered best. Now 7...<ifd7 There are four main lines in this position, each with a clearly defined character of its own. 7 dxeS, the Exchange Variation is not just an exchange of pawns. White fixes the central pawn-formation immediately and is heading for a queenless middlegame.
KING 'S INDIAN DEFENCE 103
Another way of fixing the central pawn-for- mation is 7 d5, but unlike the Exchange Varia- tion, White is closing the centre instead of opening it. This is the Petrosian System. White's most popular and probably the most critical move is 7 O-O. which can be called the Classical Variation. White keeps his options open as far as the pawn-formation in the centre is concerned, but he unhesitatingly commits himself to a place for his king. The developing move 7 Xe3 keeps even that option open. This is the Gligoric Variation. cost of a pawn and although this may look rather dubious at first sight.

Taking on e5 is useless: 9 Nxe5 <2)xe4! and Black wins back his pawn immediately. The type of middlegame that now arises is highly characteristic of the King's Indian De- fence and very important in a general sense. White has a space advantage and. given the op- portunity, he will take the initiative, most prob- ably on the queenside where the natural plan of playing c5 presents itself. Black, on the other hand, will try to turn this very pawn-formation that gives White more space into a target for his own plan of attack. For him an advance on the kingside (and against e4!) is the natural plan: ...f5. The point of the Petrosian System, as com- pared to 7 O-O, is of a strategic nature and be- comes apparent if Black now carries out his ...f5 plan straightaway: because White has not yet committed his king to the kingside he can still take the initiative on that wing himself. Thus 7...<le8 is strongly met by 8 h4, while
7...Nh5 allows White to take advantage of the
unsafe position of the knight: if he plays 8 g3, In the Exchange Variation, White is taking the long-term positional risk that d4, the tear in his pawn-formation, may become a problem. What is attractive in this line are the short-term advantages: a slight lead in development and some concrete threats. For a long time 9...Ee8 was thought to be the best move and many players were tempted to try their hand with the tiny endgame advantage offered by 10 Nd5 <71x45 1 1 cxd5. But when 9...c6 came to the fore in the 1980s, White's interest in the Exchange Variation dropped sharply. Suddenly play becomes com- plicated and tricky. Black prevents <21d5 at the

preventing Black from playing ...?lf4, the 'de- sirable' 8...1'5 runs into 9 ext'5 gxf5 10 €lxe5!. Therefore Black does better if he first devel- ops his queenside. Traditionally this was done by 7...Nbd7, intending to meet 8 O-O with
8...€)c5 9 Qc2 a5. By erecting a temporary
blockade to White's ambitions on the queen- side, Black hopes to be able to play ...f5 before White can take the initiative himself. The varia- tion is named after Tigran Petrosian because this world champion introduced the strategic idea of postponing castling in order (again) to prevent or at least discourage ...f5. His plan starts with the move 8 Jlg5 (D), pinning the knight. Both sides have developed their pieces ac- tively while at the same time throwing as many obstacles in the way of their opponent's plans as possible. Thanks to his last move. Black is now ready to play 1 1 ...<2)h7 followed by ...f5. when he has retained the possibility of playing ...gxf5. White needs to tackle the queenside problem: he must find a way to play b4. This line does not demand so much a will- ingness to throw everything forward in blind faith, as an ability to weigh carefully the conse- quences of each and every move. Characteristic finesse is demonstrated after 11 a3 Jld7, when the straightforward 12 Bbl (preparing to play 13 b4) is met with 12...a41, considerably reduc- ing While's flexibility on the queenside. W'hite does well to prevent this by playing 1 2 b3 first. Classical Variation
7 O-O (D)
White maintains the tension in the centre. He is waiting for a better moment to play either dxe5 or d5. But first it is up to Black now to decide whether he will use his chance to determine the central pawn-formation by playing 7...exd4 or if he too will maintain the tension and wait for a better moment. In the latter case he needs to find a move that fits in well with both the dxe5 and the d5 plan and which preferably increases the strength of a future ...exd4 as well. All of these requirements are well met by the classical developing move 7...<2)bd7 and it If Black breaks the pin by 8...h6 9 Xh4 g5
10 Jlg3 Nh5, White has achieved two aims.
First, he has taken some of the sting out of Black's plan because a future exf5 can now no longer be met by ...gxf5, a recapture which in many cases (though not always!) gives Black dangerous attacking chances on the kingside. Second, he can play 1 1 h4. again taking over the initiative on the kingside (or at least at- tempting to do so). For this reason, subtler ways of achieving Black's plans were developed, which resulted in the following move gradually taking over as the main line: 7 ... a5 The modem key position is reached after... 8 ilg5 116

KING'S INDIAN DEFENCE 105
Black gives up his stronghold in the centre in return for open files and diagonals for his pieces. 8 ... 2e8 9 f3 .After this logical follow-up. there are two standard plans for opening the attack on White's stronghold in the centre. The classical method is to play 9...c6. envis- aging the centra] advance ...d5. 10 Qhl is then a solid and typical reply, removing the king from the dangerous gl-a7 diagonal in order to pre-empt nasty moves like ...Rb6 and intend- ing to meet 10...d5 with 1 1 cxd5 cxd5 12 Xg5. Black usually avoids this, continuing his devel- opment with 10...?3bd7 instead.
9...Nc6 10 Be3 <2)h5 is an entirely different
approach and one which was very popular in the 1990s. Black frees the way for ...f5 and forces his opponent to take drastic measures if he wants to preserve his central dominance. An important tactical point is that 11 f4 can be met by ll...£3f6 12 Ji.f3 Bg4!. The resulting ex- changes (e.g. 13 €lxc6 Ji.xf3 14 Rxf3 bxc6) are just what Black needs in order to solve what is really his only strategic problem in this line: a lack of space. 5 £rf3 O-O 6 dLe2 e5 7 O-O < bd7 7 ... 2ibd7 (D) lot 5. should come as no surprise that this was the first main line of the King's Indian Defence, reigning supreme until around 1950. After that the much more provocative move
7...Nc6 took over, outgrowing the old main line
in importance and even becoming one of the most difficult and complicated variations of the whole of opening theory. Finally, in the late 1980s the possibility of playing 7...-5Aa6 was 'discovered'. Around that time, this way of des eloping the queen's knight, seemingly moving away from the centre but in reality eyeing the excellent square c5. began to pervade almost all variations of the King's In- dian and this is one of the lines where it turned out to be eminently playable.

7 ... exd4 8 xd4 (D) Although this is one of the oldest variations of the King's Indian Defence, it is also one of the most topical ones. After some 90 years of
106 FUNDAMENTAL CHESS OPENINGS
research, the theoretical problems are as fasci- nating as ever and we still do not even know what White's best next move is! The essence of the problem lies in the fact that it is not a particularly good moment to re- solve the tension in the centre. 8 d5 produces a position from the Petrosian System that we have just been looking at (7 d5 <2)bd7 8 O-O), while 8 dxe5 is really completely pointless here. All the books (and the players behind those books) agree that White should prefer a useful developing move, but which one? The fact that it has proved to be almost im- possible to answer this question with any de- gree of finality is of course precisely what makes this variation both difficult and attrac- tive. The classical move is 8 Bel (D). another antidote to the d5 plan. Closing the cen- tre completely with 9...c5 is most players' pre- ferred choice. We shall encounter several more examples of this pawn-structure in this book, culminating in the Czech Benoni: 1 d4 Nf6 2 c4 c5 3 d5 e5 (see page 143). The circum- stances for building such a wall are reasonably favourable in this variation because White has already castled kingside, which is not consid- ered to be White's most dangerous strategy in this type of position. Also the move Rc2 is not particularly useful here.
8 Jte3 (D) can be said to be the modem
move. Here too the idea is to meet 8...c6 with 9 d5, when in case of 9,..c5 the developing move Xe3 is of more use to White than Qc2. If
8...(3Ag4 then 9 >Lg5 f6 10 _d2 gives White a
relatively favourable version of the Gligoric Variation (7 Be3; see page 110), because here Black no longer has the aggressive option ...<$)c6. White assumes that Black will have to take on d4 sooner or later, when the rook will be well-placed on el. But Black too is able to maintain his waiting policy, for instance by
8...c6 9 Jlfl, when one of the traditional lines
continues 9...a5 10 Hbl 3e8. He may also want to consider an aggressive alternative: 9...exd4
10 Nxd4 Ng4, intending to meet 1 1 h3 with
1 1 ...Rb6!. This is in effect an attempt to expose the downside of 8 Sei . By playing 8 W2, White is thinking along d5 lines. If Black now plays 8...c6, this makes itself felt immediately since after 9 d5 the 'nor- mar 9...<21c5 is now useless. White's pawn on e4 is protected and he will be only too happy to play 10 b4. This implies that Black has to find

8...fie8, when 9 d5 runs into 9...Nd4!. It is true
that the situation is relatively favourable to try the dxe5 plan instead (8...2e8 9 dxe5 dxe5), but

practice has shown that even this does not really worry Black. If White really wants to go for it, he has to accept the challenge:

the enemy king, the danger for White may be- come very acute, but White's attack on the op- posite wing is equally threatening and a single mistake may mean immediate disaster for both sides. It is also a clash of opposing styles. There are very few players who play this variation with both colours. Almost everyone is either for White or for Black.

gain wide recognition. At first sight things seem to be going very' well for White. Black has invested two moves in order to land his knight on what looks like an extremely unattractive square (e7), and the op- tion of putting pressure on e4 with ...4bbd7-c5 (or ...Na6-c5) is gone. Yet a closer inspection of this intriguing po- sition, one of the most important of the entire King's Indian Defence, reveals the positive sides of Black's play. With the central tension resolved, Black can fully concentrate on his kingside operations. He has no problems what- soever in playing ...f5 and once this crucial ad- vance is achieved, new prospects for the knight on e7 will open up automatically. In case his kingside pawns get rolling (..T4 and ...g5-g4, once White has been induced to play f3) an ex- cellent square becomes available on g6, while if the game is opened by ...fxe4 (or exf5), then ... (x)f5 will be possible. What Black gives up in defensive strength on the queenside, he gets back in attacking power on the kingside. It should come as no surprise then that this variation is an extremely popular choice with the uncompromising attacking player. It may easily come to a situation where White breaks through on the queenside and Black on the king- side, with both players having burned their bridges. Because Black's attack is directed at White prevents ...<Sh5. frees the way for his f-pawn (which can either move forward to f3, protecting e4, or more aggressively to f4) and prepares Sd3, supporting the c5 advance. A well-established main line may serve as an ex- ample of how deeply attack on the one side and defence on the other are integrated in this varia- tion: 9...Sd7 10 Sd3 f5 1 1 _Bd2 Sf6 12 f3 f4

This variation has been studied down to the last detail, yet it is still as alive as it ever was. The sequence of moves given above may be varied at almost every moment; e.g.. White may choose a completely different strategy by playing 1 1 exf5 (instead of 1 1 ±d2) 1 1 ...gxf5

choice? Is ...a5 a useful move, delaying White s attack, or will this turn out to be a weakening of the queenside in the long run? Is it better per- haps to forget about these nuances of posi- tional play and go all-out on the kingside with
9...(?3d7 1 0 b4 1'5, leaving the queenside to fend
for itself? These are very profound questions indeed and anyone who makes a thorough study of this line is likely not only to construct a solid open- ing repertoire but to discover a lot about the po- sitional aspects of this type of position. On a concrete level, theory seems to have de- cided that building a few defensive barriers on the queenside is a good idea. This has led to

12 f4. shifting the battle to the kingside, or he may play 13 g4 (instead of 13 c5), hoping to achieve exactly the opposite, namely, to close off the kingside and reign supreme on the queen- side afterwards.
9 Nd2 (D) was a fantastically popular varia-
tion in the early 1990s. Then there is a major division arising after the logical 10 a3, between 10...Nd7 1 1 Ebl f5 on the one side and 10...Bd7 1 1 b3 (1 1 Ebl al- lows Black to play 1 l...a4) 1 l...c5 or even the flexible 1 1 ...c6 on the other. Troubled by this multitude of defensive pos- sibilities, White then turned his attention to 9 b4 (D), a move which until about 1995 had been relatively out of favour for two reasons. First. 9,..'?3h5 was thought to be an annoy- ing move because White must then either al- low this knight to jump to f4 or he must play the weakening g3. Second, Black has 9...a5. disrupting White's pawn-phalanx on the queen- side. It is interesting to note that the recent history of this variation is at the same time a nice illus- tration of how opening theory works: ever more Here too White wants to play c5. but instead of preparing this pawn-break with £tel-d3. he chooses to prepare it with b4 so as to allow his knight to move to the truly splendid square c4 after he has played c5. This will enable him to put pressure on d6. which is the base and there- fore the only really vulnerable point in Black's pawn-chain. This variation too has been minutely ana- lysed, with the emphasis on how Black should react to this plan on the queenside. Is ...c5 a wise precaution and if so, should White play dxc6 or is the patient a3 and b4 the better

7 ... Na6 (D) detailed analysis uproots even the soundest general principles in the end (and thus creates new ones). First it was shown that 9...'2>h5 can be met by 10 Sei Stf4 1 1 Jlfl (D). The rise to fame of this move during the last decade of the 20th century has radically changed the face of a good many variations of the King's Indian Defence. We have already seen how
6...?)a6 came to be accepted as an excellent
way of meeting the Four Pawns Attack (see page 96). Here, in the Classical Variation.
7...Qa6 is really a subtle variation on the old
main line 7...i2)bd7. Black preserves the tension in the centre, while eyeing c5 as a future square for his knight, but without giving up the possi- bility of playing ..Jlg4. This changes the char- acter of the opening subtly but considerably. Of course White can play 8 d5, steering the game into the Petrosian System (8...Nc5 9 Rc2 a5), just like he can against 7...'5)bd7, but as we have seen, this docs not really cause Black any headaches. Again, just as in the 7...Q>bd7 line, the real test of 7...4)a6 is to play a useful devel- oping move. The first difference is felt after 8 Rc2, which in this case is not useful at all since Black can play 8...$)b4 and if now 9 Rb3 then
9...<2)06 10 d5 Nd4! makes it very clear that
the manoeuvre Rc2-b3 is not something to be proud of. The classical move is (again) 8 Sei, when after 8...c6 9 Afl a key position arises. On the one hand Black has the nimble 9...exd4 10 2)xd4 Ng4, the idea being to meet 1 1 h3 with I l...Qb6 (or ll...Rf6); on the other hand he can play the rather more profound 9...Jlg4 (D). This manoeuvre had presumably been con- sidered to be far too passive at first, but because Black's knight is not completely secure on f4. it is not so easy to proceed. 1 l...f5, for instance, runs into 12 Bxf4 exf4 13 e5!. Then it turned out that the damage done to White's pawn-phalanx by 9...a5 is not all that serious, because after 10 Jka.3 (10 bxa5 is also quite playable) IO...axb4 1 1 Bxb4 4Bd7 12 a4 White will eventually press through c5 anyway with moves like a5 and 5 a4. Once this plan is successfully carried out. Black may well start to regret having started hostilities on the queen- side with only his opponent having taken ad- vantage of it in the end.

Profound because it now looks as if White can finally shut the a6-knight effectively out of play by 10 d5, now that 10...£te5?I is pointless (and will be met by 1 1 b4). However, Black has a highly original alternative to 10..,£?.c5 which keeps his position fully alive. By play- ing 10...Nb4!, threatening 1 1 ...Bxf3, when 12 Rxf3 RJc2 costs White the exchange and 12 gxf3 disrupts his kingside pawn-formation, he more or less forces the reply 1 1 jLe2. This gives Black just enough time to play 1 l...a5 so as to be able to retreat his knight behind the a-pawn instead of in front of it (12 a3 4:Ja6). Suddenly, just because Black has managed to get ...a5 in, his knight on a6 is in the middle of the battle- field (namely, the battle for b4) instead of shut off from it. Perhaps I should add that Black has a good no-nonsense alternative to all this in the shape of the robust 10...c5. The second main line is 8 Be3. Here too a variation has been developed to make good use of the position of Black's knight on a6:
8...Ng4 9 Jig5 and now not the obvious 9,..f6
but 9...Qe8 (D). This move is possible because 10 43d5, which would have been strong with the black knight on d7, makes no sense now that c7 is protected. There are a few nasty points to 9...Q'e8, most notably the threat of 10...exd4 1 1 xd4 <21xh2! 12 sfcxh2 Qe5+. Practical evidence seems to in- dicate that 10 dxe5 dxe5 11 h3 is White's best option in this line. This is in fact one of the few instances in the whole of the King's Indian De- fence w'here the dxe5 strategy is really an excel- lent choice. Just like in the Exchange Variation proper (see page 103) White hopes that his slightly more active piece development will yield dividends. The potential drawbacks are also the same: the d4-square remains the Achil- les' Heel in White's pawn-formation. Gligoric Variation 7 .e3 (D) This move is even more flexible than 7 O-O. Not only does White retain the choice between d5 and dxc5, he also does not commit himself to a place for his king. These advantages are demonstrated most clearly if Black now plays 7...<?)c6. White re- sponds 8 d5 Qe7 9 5)d2, when he has in fact achieved a superior version of the variation 7 O-O *57>c6 8 d5 'fete? 9 3bd2 because his knight on d2 is not obstructing his bishop on cl and he is free to castle queensice should this be required.

Therefore the immediate attack on the bishop is critical for the assessment of 7 Ac3: 7 ... 2>g4 8 ±g5 f6
9 Nh4 (D)
We have reached the most important starting position of the Gligoric Variation. This variation was developed in the 1950s. It has always occupied a modest but not unimpor- tant place in the King's Indian arsenal. Just like in the Samisch Variation, White keeps open the possibility of an attack on the kingside with moves like g4 and h4. Yet at the same time he reserves the f3-square for his knight so that he will also be able to play 'sim- ply - with Nf3 and O-O. Black faces a dilemma: should he tolerate White's bishop on g5 or should he chase it away with ...h6? He also has to make up his mind about which pawn-formation to choose in the centre. At first a ...c5 formation was the most popu- lar option, either by playing 6...c5 immediately or preceded by 6...h6. In recent years, attention has shifted to sev- eral ways of implementing the other standard plan: ...e5. In this case the immediate 6...e5?? is a bad blunder, losing to 7 dxe5 dxe5 8 ' 'xd8 2xd8 9 Nd5 (this line features prominently in several collections of opening traps), but both
6...£'ibd7 and 6...Na6 are useful moves, pre-
paring this central advance.

This is the only ...c5 variation which I have decided not to move to the Benoni chapter.

Strategically, the problems are the same as in the 7 O-O R3c6 line, but because White has not castled and his bishop is on 114, the solutions will have to be quite different. A very important feature of the Gligoric Vari- ation is that is has been analysed far less exten- sively than 7 O-O. Opening theory is not an obstacle if you wish to play this line, yet neither is it a support. Averbakh Variation

than the traditional 9 cxd5 - turned out to leave Black with a slightly passive (if solid) position, the true King's Indian aficionado began to feel uneasy and started looking for other ways to deal with the Averbakh Variation. It is pre- cisely this type of middlegame, by the way, that established the Averbakh's reputation as a line that does not allow Black to demonstrate his normal King's Indian aggression. It is in this light that the pawn sacrifice 7...b5 8 cxb5 a6 has to be judged. This is about the sharpest way of meeting the Averbakh that can be imagined, but although theory does not deny the latent dangers lying in store for White, it se- riously doubts the correctness of this line. It is a variation 'for experts only'. In the end it was really 7...h6, intending to improve subtly on 7...e6, which carried the day. If White retreats his bishop to e3. Black will steer toward the same pawn-formation that we have seen in the 7...c6 variation with a small but vitally important difference: after 8 jLe.3 e6 9 Rd2 exd5 10 exd5 <Nh7 there is no longer a white bishop on g5 to put pressure on Black's position. This tiny difference is enough to make theory (but not every King's Indian aficionado!) regard this line as satisfactory for Black. For this reason 8 Jtf4 has come to be looked upon as White's best move. This seems to prevent
8...e6 but strangely enough it is precisely this
move which has become the main line: 8...e6! 9 dxe6 J.xe6 10 Bxd6 Se8 (D). Indian Defence that a breach of tradition is un- called for. Black again faces a choice. In the very first years of the Averbakh Varia- tion, 7...a6 8 a4 Qa5 was the usual recipe for obtaining counterplay. Black intends to meet 9 Rd2 with the typical pawn sacrifice 9...b5! 10 cxb5 axb5 11 Bxb5 Ba6. obtaining a strong ini- tiative against White's now slightly weakened pawn-formation on the queenside. But then the Soviet grandmaster Yuri Averbakh showed that
9 Bd2 is much stronger than 9 Rd2 and that in
fact Black's queen is rather misplaced on a5 af- ter this move; e.g., 9...e6 10 Nf3 exd5 1 1 exd5 and Black is not getting any counterplay at all. This led to the emergence of 7...c6 (D) as the new main line. But when after 8 Qd2 exd5 here too recap- turing on d5 with the e-pawn - 9 exd5 rather Black's lead in development gives him that typical King's Indian sort of compensation for

the pawn, which seems almost invisible at first but very soon turns out to force White to play with great precision. This complicated position is one of the most theoretically critical of the entire Averbakh Variation. the one with the natural space advantage on that wing. So Black will have to perform a balancing act between being aggressive on the queenside and keeping open the possibility of lashing out on the kingside with ...f5. In this context, however, the move ...h6 began to be seen as a slight weak- ening of Black's chances. In due time attention shifted again, this time to Black's other ways of preparing ...e5: 6... 3bd7 and 6...<?}a6.

This makes 7 Be3 the main line, when Black has two options. First, he can play 7...c5, which after 8 d5 leads to a position that also arises from the 6...c5 variation (6...c5 7 d5 h6 8 Be3) and which we have seen to be satisfactory for Black. White may try to improve on this trans- position by playing 8 e5 or 8 dxc5. But 6...h6 can also be interpreted as a prepa- ration for ...e5.

Black will try to counterattack on the queenside, using manoeuv- res like ...5}bd7-c5, ...c6 and ...a5 or ...b5. yet it is vital that he does not remain entirely passive on the kingside either, because if White manages to seduce his opponent into answering h4-h5 with ...g5, chances are that it will be White who gets a free hand on the queenside.

remains unblocked, the bishop will cover some vita! squares in the centre and put pressure on Black's queenside. It also supports a later e4 (for this remains a move to be reckoned with) in a very natural manner. A major difference between this and the 3 f2jc3/4 e4 scheme is that by playing 3 g3 White abandons any ideas of a swift kingside attack. Moves like h4 or g4 are not to be expected in this line. White concentrates on keeping Black's counterplay in check and maintains a flexible pawn-structure. It should come as no surprise that the g3 sys- tem has always been particularly popular with those players who have a keen sense of posi- tional play and a good technique in exploiting tiny advantages. 3 ...

This is Black's oldest reply to the g3 sys- tem. Over the last three quarters of a century, many alternatives have made their mark, but the wealth of resources offered by this classi- cal strategy has not dried up in the least. It re- mains one of Black's most popular and most dynamic options.
8 e4 (D)
With this move, White brings about a key position. blow n up this tiny difference to enormous pro- portions. A first comparison between the two lines seems to favour the Classical Variation. Both the d5 and the dxe5 plans lose strength with a bishop on g2 because in the resulting rigid pawn-structure, this piece will no longer bring pressure to bear on he enemy queenside. But the great advantage of the g3 system is that e4 is well-protected, which makes it diffi- cult for Black to put pressure on White's centre pawns and this rules out some of the options Black used to good effect in the Classical Varia- tion. Only by exchanging pawns on d4 at some point will he be able to complete his develop- ment. This does not mean that Black has no choice. It may make a great deal of difference when Black plays ...exd4 and even the mere threat of taking on d4 may be enough to deter- mine the course of the opening. Black's simplest option is to take on d4 straightaway and to develop some of his pieces to active posts; e.g" 8...exd4 9 <2)xd4 He8 10 h3 <2k5 11 £el c6 (D). This is the classical treatment of the 6...Nbd7 variation. Black has less space, but his position has no weaknesses, his pieces are well-posi- tioned and he has the prospect of continuing ...a5-a4 followed by ...Qa5. The manoeuvre ...2)fd7-e5 might also come in handy. White will have to he patient and careful. A good plan is to play Sbl, b3 and a3 followed by b4, to chase away Black's knight and gain space on the queenside. There is not really a lot of difference be- tween this and the starting position of the Clas- sical Variation with 7...Nbd7 (see page 105), only that White's bishop has been moved from e2 to g2. But eighty years of practical experi- ence and intensive theoretical research have
116 FUNDAMENTAL CHESS OPENINGS
with 7...4fe5, but with 7...Na5, attacking the pawn on c4. Instead, White can simply continue his de- velopment:
7 O-O (D)
White then has a large number of sound moves; e.g., 9 Eel. 9 b3 and 9 Jlc3. but 9 113. preparing to play Be3 without being bothered by ...Ng4, has always been the most popular choice. Now the consequences of 9...exd4 are similar to 8,..exd4, but maintaining the tension (e.g. 9...Ra5) or even intensifying it by playing
9...Qb6 are no less interesting options. The
latter move in particular presents White with a difficult decision, which decades of practical experience have failed to solve. What is he to do? Black is threatening to play 10...exd4 1 1 £jxd4 Nxe4 and the 'natural' reply 10 Ji.e3 does not work because it leaves the pawn on b2 hanging. Taking on e5 is decidedly unattractive and 10 d5. though not a bad move, does little to challenge the validity of 9...#b6. After 10... k:5 1 1 Eel cxd5 1 2 cxd5 Jld7 the queen is well- placed on b6. In fact, the position after 9...'S'b6 is a major parting of the ways. White can either preserve the tension with 10 Eel or he can attempt a out- right refutation of Black's provocative queen move by means of the violent 10 c5 dxc5 1 1 dxe5, which, after 1 1 ...i£je8, will lead to a highly complicated position. Black now has several options, all with their own specific idea. With 7...e5 Black opts for the same classical strategy as 6...Nbd7, albeit in a more forceful manner.
7...a6 is more subtle. Black wants to play
8...Eb8 and 9...b5. This is the Panno Varia-
tion, one of Black's most popular options for more than half a century. Other (more or less) respectable variations are 7...Jlg4 and 7... j.f5, but these have never ac- quired the same following as the two main lines.
7... .g4 is intended to put pressure on d4 with
8...Nd7, but since 8 d5 a5 (after 8...Bxf3 9
exf3, White's play on the e-file is more impor- tant than the apparent weakening of his pawns) 9 Nd2 produces the same pawn-formation as in the Panno Variation with the chances of ...jLg4 turning out less useful than ...a6 rather high,
7...Bg4 has never gained wide acceptance.
7...Af5 is a way of seeking control over the
important e4-square, but it is a highly provoca- tive move, offering White a choice of attractive replies. Still, this move is played fairly often, perhaps because it is a rare opportunity for seri- ously provoking White in the otherwise very solid g3 system. After 8 d5 Na5 White can con- tinue solidly enough with 9 <5Td2, but 9 <21d4 is very tempting, intending to meet 9...,?)xc4?!
6...<23c6
6 ... S3c6 We have already seen this move as a reliable way of meeting the Samisch Variation (see page 100). In this case Black intends to meet 7 d5 not

7 ... e5 (Dj Black wants to take the initiative on the queenside with 8...Bb8 and 9...b5, keeping ...e5 in reserve for future operations. White has plenty of ways to meet this daring plan, but of course theory has always focused on the more aggressive ones. 8 " d5 This is the traditional main line. If White prefers a simple developing move instead, such as 8 b3. Black will execute his plan undisturbed. After 8...Eb8 9 ..b2 b5 10 cxb5 axb5 1 1 ficl b4 12 51b1 5>a7 chances are even. Far from being misplaced on a7. Black's knight is heading for a bright future on the ac- tive square b5. The most important alternative to 8 d5 is a plan based on playing e4. Unfortunately for White, the immediate 8 e4 runs into 8...Ng4 9 Ne3 51d7, intending 10...e5 11 d5 51d4 and putting considerable pressure on d4. White has to make a preparatory move: 8 h3 (D). This is an attempt to bring about the well- known type of middlegame with a closed centre which we have already seen in several King's Indian variations, most notably in the Classical Variation. In fact it is quite a forcing move since 8 dxe5 does not hold out any great promise for White even though the fact that he has omitted e4 means that taking on e5 does not involve the usual long-term positional risk of a 'hole' on d4. Therefore the ambitious player finds him- self more or less forced to play 8 d5, falling in with Black's plan. The critical position arises after 8...53e7 9 e4 <2Be8 (or 9...Qkl7). With his bishop on g2. White's prospects of making in- roads on the queenside are reduced, but his defences on the kingside are strengthened. White can either play the aggressive 10 b4 or the prophylactic 10 el f5 11 ?Id3, taking control of the important squares e4 and f4. Panno Variation 7 ... a6 (D) This move seems less direct and less aggres- sive than 7...e5, but it is at least as ambitious and much more subtle.
118 FUNDAMENTAL CHESS OPENINGS

9 e4 b5 contains many sharp variations, based
on 10 e5 or 10 cxb5 axb5 1 1 e5, that have been investigated very deeply, 8 ... 21a5 By thus attacking the pawn on c4, Black puts his finger on the Achilles' Heel of the g3 sys- tem. 9 £td2 c5 (D) This position is the starting point for some subtle and deeply-analysed variations. Black can either take a natural step forward in the cen- tre by playing 12...e6 or 12...e5 or he can play the more aggressive 12...bxc4 13 bxc4 Bh6. At first sight, Black's last move looks rather primi- tive but on closer inspection it turns out to con- tain quite a bit of poison. In the first place, White cannot parry the threat of 14...Xxd2 by the seemingly natural move 14 e3 because this runs into 14...jLf5!, when both I5e4 fLxd2and 1 5 'Seed 4u)xe4 16 atxe4 -Nxe4 17 Nxe4 >53x04! cost White a pawn. Therefore White must ei- ther take a (temporary) step backwards with 14 Ncbl or make a double-edged step forward by 14 f4. The latter move in particular leads to a fierce battle (14,..e5!) demanding great accu- racy and cold-bloodedness (and some theoreti- cal knowledge!) from both players. Yugoslav Variation 6 ... c5(D) Safeguarding tire knight on a5 against White's b4 advance. Black's plan remains unchanged: he wants to play ...2Nb8 and ...b5. White's main line now is to anticipate this manoeuvre by pre- paring to play b3.

12 ±b2(D) As we have seen, Black can use this move as an invitation to transpose to the Benoni (7 d5; see page 141) in every line of the King's Indian Defence. Independent lines arise only if White does not accept this invitation.
7 O-O 4Bc6
Increasing the pressure and inviting White, even more pressingly than before, to play 8 d5. After 8...<3a5 9 5M2 a6 this would lead, perhaps somewhat surprisingly, to a position we have just seen as 'belonsing' to the Panno Variation.
KING'S INDIAN DEFENCE 119
In fact 6...c5 can be said to be an alternative route toward this position. The choice between
6...c5 and 6...Nc6 will depend on which of the
'side effects' Black prefers. Choosing 6...€)c6 7 O-O a6 means Black is not overly worried about White's alternatives to 8 d5. Choosing 6...c5 implies a readiness to play both the Benoni (7 d5) and the following more open position: 8 dxcS dxc5 (D) move theory has come up with is the modest 10 aLd2. You cannot say II 4bd5 is actually a threat in this position but since it does prevent some of Black's natural moves (10...Ed8? for instance) it has become fairly normal to reply
10...Rd8. confronting White with the question if
lais extra move Bd2 (as compared to the diagram above) has any real value. By playing 1 1 Wcl followed by 12 ,4.h6 White can try to answer this question in the affirmative. Instead of protecting his pawn on c5. Black may want to counterat- tack against White's c4-pawn: 9...Jle6. In that case it is up to White either to maintain the ten- sion by 10 Qa4 or to simplify with, e.g., 10 ji.xc5 #a5 1 1 xa3 Bxc4.
9 J*.f4 is also a respectable move. White puts
his queen's bishop on a good square without hurrying to create any direct threats.
6...c6
6 ... c6 (D) This variation had its heyday during the 1950s and 1960s but half a century later it is still popular and highly relevant for the entire g3 system. As so often in positions with a sym- metrical pawn-formation, the rule of thumb is ihat if it is your move you have the advantage. The second rale is that once you have really fallen into a passive position, you will be con- demned to a long and gruelling defence. Nevertheless the choice between 8 d5 and 8 dxc5 is, to some extent at least, one of personal preference. One player may feel attracted by the long-term advantage of having more space, while the other may prefer the short-term ad- vantage of having the initiative. The first target that presents itself for using that initiative is the unprotected pawn on c5. In fact, the position after 9 jce3 is an excellent il- lustration of the general character of the entire variation. Both players will have to make subtle positional assessments, yet ±ey also have to do some accurate calculating work. It is easy to see :hat the 'ideal' way of protecting c5, 9...b6?, loses material to 10 43e5, but it is far more diffi- cult to find an antidote to 9...Ra5. The best This is a move that fits into several plans.
7 O-O Ra5 (D)
This is the oldest and best accepted by theory of Black's many possibilities in this position.
7...a6 and 8...b5, although a normal enough
plan in the King's Indian Defence, is not often played here, because White's bishop is well- nigh ideally posted on g2 for an immediate counterattack in the centre: 8 e4 b5 9 e5.
7... ,f5 is a much more common alternative
and far less provocative and risky than when combined with 6...Qic6 (instead of 6...c6).
120 FUNDAMENTAL CHESS OPENINGS
However, it is also slightly less aggressive, since a pawn on c6 is less influential in the cen- tre than a knight on that square. 8 Ne 1 is a prin- cipled reply, but there are many players who prefer a calm development of their queenside with 8 b3 51e4 9 dkb2. sustain the pressure against White's central for- mation or does Black's aggression not really bother White? The immediate 8...''-S'a6 has also been tried.
8...e5 <D) is a more classical approach.
7...Ra5 is a move of an entirely different
calibre, opening up the possibility of ...Qh5, which in turn enables Biack to play ...Jkh3 or ...Ag4. This is a fairly aggressive strategy.
8 h3 (D)
The most cautious reply.
8 e4 has also been played, intending to meet
8...Bh5 with 9 e5, when a transition to an end-
game after 9...dxc5 10 5ke5 xdl 1 1 Sxdl is probably not very attractive to one who has just played ...Ra5-h5 in order to create attacking chances against White's king. 8...Jig4 and 8...e5 are more in keeping with such a view. The latter move transposes (after 9 b3) to a position that is also reached via 8 h3 e5 9 e4 and will be dis- cussed below. The positive side of 8 h3 is that it prevents Black from playing 8...Qh5?, which would now run into 9 <2>g5l, followed by 10 Jtf3, trapping the queen. The negative side is that it is a somewhat slow move, encouraging moves like 8....?,e6, attacking c4. The critical test of this line is 9 Rd3 Qa6 10 b3 d5. Will Black be able to After 9 e4 Black has a direct transposition to the 6... bd7 variation by 9...ftbd7. but 9...exd4 10 5 xd4 Qc5 is an interesting alternative, the point being that 1 1 b3 (the natural way to pro- tect c4) runs into 1 l...Nxe4!. It is true that White can simply play 1 1 Nb3 Qxc4 12 Qxd6. exchanging c4 for d6. but whether this is actu- ally a good idea is a moot point. White has solved his own problems, but by doing so he has also solved his opponent's problems for him. Grunfeld Defence

As we have seen in the previous chapter, 3 -?Jc3 is the first move to consider in this posi- tion, with 3 g3 (or 3 Nf3 Bg7 4 g3) being the most important alternative. A third move to have found its niche in open- ing theory is 3 f3. We shall now look at these moves not from a King's Indian, but from a Grunfeld perspective: before White is able to play e4, Black will counterattack in the centre with ...d5. Timing is very important in this strategy. As an illustration of what Black should not do, let us first look at 3 Nf3. If Black wants to play a Grunfeld against this move, he is well-advised to play 3"Jkg7 first and only throw in 4".d5 after White has played either 4 Qc3 or 4 g3 (in the lat- ter case Black can even wait a little longer; e.g., 4 g3 O-O 5 jLg2 d5). Of course it is not illegal to play 3...d5?! at once, but this move allows the op- ponent an unnecessarily large freedom of choice in determining his reaction. After 4 cxd5 Nxd5

3 Nc3
3 £k3 d5 (D) With this move Black gives the game a char- acter which is totally different from the King's Indian Defence. One could even say that he is actually playing a Queen's Gambit Deferred, albeit a sharper version of it, focusing entirely on active piece-play and creating and utilizing as many open files and diagonals as possible. In most variations Black will play an early ...c5, giving his g7-bishop ample scope to join in the battle. The opening is named after Ernst Grunfeld, who braved the scepticism of a totally classically oriented chess world i n the 1920s. His courage has since been richly rewarded, for many of the greatest chess-players after him have taken up his opening: e.g., world champions Botvin- nik, Smyslov, Fischer and Kasparov. All of them have contributed towards the theoretical development of the Grunfeld Defence and most importantly they have all demonstrated the vi- ability of its main strategic aim: the battle over the centre. White has a choice of reacting ambitiously or cautiously. The most principled and there- fore the most ambitious variation at his disposal is 4 cxd5. the Exchange Variation. The variations 4 Bg5 and 4 Af4 are more cautious, yet not without venom. Both of these moves introduce concrete threats against d5 and c7, respectively. 4 £jf3 is White's most neutral move. After the logical 4...Bg7 White then has several op- tions, some of them cautious, one extremely ambitious. Exchange Variation Nxd5 <5"Bxc3 Ng7 (D) 4 cxd5 5 e4 6 bxc3

After more than eighty years of theoretical discussion, it is still not clear whether White's broad pawn-centre is strong or weak, unless we accept the philosophical conclusion that it is both. On the one hand. White's centre pawns arc a strong enough force that they can eventually suffocate the opponent, while on the other hand they do indeed provide Black with a beautiful target for a counterattack, starting with ...c5. It is true that the crucial link in White's pawn-formation, the pawn on d4, is well-protected by the pawn on c3, but it is also precisely this formation which lends a certain rigidity to White's position. Because the pawn on c3 is itself not protected, White will be un- able to react to ...c5 with either d5 or dxc5, moves which would otherwise be very natural indeed. As a rule, White is thus condemned to defend his pawn on d4. Whether this is a good or a bad thing is entirely dependent on the spe- cific circumstances. So, the answer to the fundamental question remains open. This brings us to a much more important, and above all, a more practical ques- tion: who will make the most of his chances? The main lines start with 7 and 7 Jlc4.
7 Ba3 is also possible, but theory has never
held this move in high regard, because it does not achieve what it pretends to achieve: to stop ...c5. With moves like ... d7 and ...b6, Black will have no trouble achieving this advance. Once he does, the positioning of the bishop on a3 is moot. Now there are two main lines, the sound and logical move 8 and the profound 8 2bl . The latter move in particular has been the sub- ject of incredibly deep analysis. The reason why 7 <2Bf3 was out of grace for so long is that before the late 1970s, theory did not look deeper into the position than taking simple developing moves like 8 jle2 for granted. This causes problems with the defence of d4: after 8 i.e2 Q>c6 9 Ne3 Jlg4 White is practically forced to play 10 e5, which hands Black the d5-square on a plate and reduces the latent dy- namics in White's position considerably. It is exactly this sort of concession that White should try to avoid in the Exchange Variation. At the very least he should make the opponent pay a high price for it, not give it away for free. 7 2>f3 c5 8 ±e3

Not only does he provide d4 with some extra cover beforehand, but he also prepares Ecl, protecting c3 and thus en- abling White to play d5.

initiative been brought to a halt or has it not? Can White finally start reaping the benefits of his spatial advantage? Not only has White had to give up castling, but he has also been forced to move his king back to el . Nevertheless, on the whole his strat- egy has proved justified. Those pieces that have been developed are well-positioned and the ad- vance d5 is a sound method of putting pressure on Black's position. Both the cautious 14...i21b4 and the more ad- venturous 14...<21a5 have been tried here with acceptable results, but 14..A'Be5 has been shown to make it too easy for White to set his central pawns in motion.
7 c5 8 Sbl
8 £bl (D) The answer is as self-evident as it is unex- pected. White plays the only move that can be a problem for ...4jc6, namely 9 d5I. Since there is no longer a rook on al, White is sacri- ficing only a pawn (and not an exchange) af- ter 9...Jl.xc3+ 10 .d2, and because Black is forced to exchange his powerful bishop, mak- ing his kingside vulnerable to attack, it turns out that White obtains excellent compensation after 10..Bxd2+ 1 1 Rxd2, no matter to which square Black moves his knight. The result of this is that Black must find a new plan, and this is what Griinfeld devotees have done with great enthusiasm ever since the
8 Sbl bomb exploded. This has resulted in two
main lines, both starting from the next diagram.
8 ... O-O
9 &,e2 (D) To begin with, notwithstanding the objec- tions outlined above, the natural move 9...Qic6 was explored in great depth. This was the main line during the mid-1980s. Then, in the last decade of the 20th century, attention shifted to 9...cxd4 10 cxd4 Qa5+. Black challenges his opponent to play 11 Jld2. a particularly unclear pawn sacrifice. This is now seen by many as the main line of the entire Griinfeld Defence. In the early days, the immediate 9...Qa5 was sometimes played, but when it became clear that a similar pawn sacrifice, 10 O-O, makes life much harder for Black than in the 9...cxd4 vari- ation, this was largely abandoned. In case of
10...'fi'xa2 1 1 Jtg5 White has a full extra tempo
This subtle rook move leads us right into the heart of the modern-day Griinfeld. It is this variation, more than any other, which has given the opening a whole new face after 1980. Ev- erybody who wants to play the Griinfeld has to have an answer - and a very good one - to this variation. White is anticipating the ...Nc6 and ...jLg4 plan, but he does so in a less direct, and an ap- parently less aggressive, way than 8 Be3. For what is really the point of 8 £bl? It is easy enough to notice that ...Bg4 loses some of its attractions when a pawn on b7 is left behind un- protected, but what could possibly be the prob- lem with 8...Nc6?

9...b6 is another early variation, but one
which - unlike 9...Ra5 - has remained popular, if only moderately so. It is in fact the preferred choice of players who do not like long and forc- ing variations. Black simply accepts the fact that White has been able to consolidate his pawn-centre and moves on to the middlegame. meaning. At first sight a middle-class move like 12 Rc2 strikes one as a more plausible way of protecting c3, yet after 12...Rc7 13 h3 e6 it soon transpires that White's position lacks many of the dynamic possibilities which 12 Rd2 offers. 8 flbl O-O 9 Jle2 <Nc6 9 ... Qc6(D) Theoretical discussion of this line first con- centrated on 12...e6 13 f4, with the principled follow-up 13...jLg7 14 c4. Black tried just about everything to blow a hole in White's mas- sive pawn-centre. Variations like 14...exd5 15 cxd5 Jcd4 16 J4.b2 and now either 16...Rb6 or
16...Rh4+ 17 g3 Re7 (intending to meet 18
jLxd4 with 18...Rxe4) have been played in sometimes truly brilliant games. Eventually though, theory took a different route. The un- conventional 13..Jtc7 prevents White from supporting his stronghold on d5 with 14 c4?? because of 14...jLa5. All of a sudden, after 14 O-O exd5 15 exd5, it is a fairly static position we are looking at. How should it be evaluated? Will White be able to take advantage of the ab- sence of the Griinfeld bishop from g7 or wil I he not? Also the slightly more cautious move 12...b6 has come to the fore. Black is waiting for 13 f4 Ji.g7 14 O-O before he opens the attack on White's pawn-centre with 14...e6, when most players choose between 15 dxe6 and 15 Bc4. Anyone who wishes to play this line, with either colour, will have to make a thorough stud)' of these variations, which are not only difficult strategically, but are drenched in tac- tics as well. This is more accurate than 8...?3c6, which I have discussed above, because Black's 'extra move' 8...O-O is likely to be more useful than White's 9 .e2.

Black's position has no apparent weaknesses, he has two connected passed pawns on the queenside and he has an extra pawn, but the pressure that is created by White's two centre pawns and his lead in development have proved to be intangible but telling factors time and time again. In this focal point of modem opening theory, new ideas are being introduced, tried and dis- carded almost continuously, a dynamic process the end of which is not yet in sight.

The starting position for all analysis arises after 12...fixf7 13 fxg4 Sxfl-t- 14 sfcxf1 . Black's initiative has turned out to be quite satisfactory, especially after the bold counter-thrust 14,..cxd4 15cxd4e5 16d5?3c4. indirectly atiacking the bishop on c4 (the pos- sibility of playing 1 l...cxd4 12 cxd4 <Nxd4 is introduced, although this is not a real threat because by playing 13 jlxf7+ White prevents the loss of a pawn). The real point of 10...Rc7 though, is that Black is going to play 1 l...Sd8, increasing the pressure on d4. During the 1980s, attention shifted back to
10...j ,g4, which had been the main line several
decades earlier. This is a more forcing move. White has to play 1 1 f3, whereupon Black has another aggressive move, 1 l...Na5 (N). 4±g5 This move betrays a completely different mind-set. for strategically 4 Bg5 is far less de- termined and less radical than 4 cxd5.

pawn on d4. In this way White hopes to slow things down a little bit and contain Black's counterplay. The alternative 5 Ah4 pursues the same idea. In the early days of the Griinfeld White used to play the obvious move 5 Nxe4 but this soon turned out to play into Black's hands. Af- ter 5...dxe4 and now, for instance, 6 f3 J&g7 Black's control over the vital al-h8 diagonal is a telling factor.

After 5 Bxf6 ,Nxf6 6 Nxd5 he calmly retreats the bishop (6... .g7). when he is ready to pounce on White's pawn- centre with 7...c6 or (in case of 7 e3) 7...c5. Taking on <15 with the pawn (6 cxdS) is more solid, but even here Black has a way of destroy- ing White's centre and obtaining compensation for the pawn: 6...c6! and if now 7 dxc6 dlxd4 8 cxb7 Bxb7 Black has a substantial lead in de- velopment.

This retreat may look a bit confusing, but in fact the strategic idea behind 4 Jcg5 is already beginning to materialize. The threat against d5 is renewed and Black is invited to head for a pawn-formation which is similar to the Ex- change Variation in so far as White does get a mass of centre pawns, but at the same time fun- damentally different in that White can still play e3 instead of e4, thus giving full support to his This position is crucial for the 4 jLg5 varia- tion. White's plan to turn d4 into a fortress has succeeded, but at the price of relinquishing the pressure on Black's position that is so typical of

the Exchange Variation. The whole line is tai- lor-made for players who prefer subtle ma- noeuvring to cut-throat aggression. A typical continuation is 9 cxd5 cxd4 10 cxd4 Rxd5 11 Ae2 <2k6 12 O-O Af5. it is not only a matter of what to play. Accurate timing is at least as important. For instance, in this position 5...O-O is no less a natural move than 5...c5. intending to play this advance a little later, possibly after 6 AJf3. Yet this move allows White to demonstrate a crucial point of his fourth move, namely 6 cxd5 4jxd5 7 4bxd5 Rxd5 8 Bxc7 (D). 4Nf4

Just like 4 -"_g5, this has been a popular way of countering the Griinfeld ever since its incep- tion. White combines a sound development of his pieces with controlled aggression. 4 ... "lg7 (D) This pawn sacrifice has been hotly debated ever since it was first accepted. Black has tried several ways of taking advantage of White's now' somewhat forlorn bishop on c7. Sharpest is 8...$Jc6 9 Jtg4, yet modern theory con- siders this to he rather dubious. 8...<2)a6 is a more solid option. Since hanging on to the extra pawn with 9 Bg3 is risky because of 9...Jtf5 threatening lO.-.'Slbd, White has to exchange his material advantage for a positional one: 9 i.xa6 Qxg2 10 Rf3 Qxf3 1 1 2>xf3 bxa6. The question then is whether the open files and di- agonals fully compensate Black for the sacri- fice of his queenside pawn-structure. We now return to 5...c5 (D): 6 dxc5 The great thing about the Griinfeld is that Black immediately takes over the initiative if White relaxes and starts avoiding the fight. For instance, Black would be very happy if White simply plays 6 £}f3 in this position. Though a sound enough developing move in itself, this is just not sufficiently sharp to create any seri- ous problems. After 6...cxd4 7 exd4 the open- ing skirmish is over already with Black having obtained a good position: no weaknesses and There is not a wide variety of strategic motifs in this line, but the consequences of seemingly minimal differences in implementing them can be far-reaching. To begin with, the difference between 5 e3 and 5 <2jf3 is surprisingly large.

7 Scl is an attempt to keep the reins much
tighter than this. Black can win his pawn back by playing 7...dxc4 8 J,xc4 O-O 9 f3 (9 5Be2 is an alternative that leads to sharp play, and makes use of the fact that White has not already committed this knight to f3) 9...Rxc5 (D). the strategic prospect of putting pressure on d4. 6 dxc5 on the other hand, does put Black's opening play to the test. By opening the al-h8 diagonal, White makes the bishop on g7 a very powerful piece, but he trusts his position to be sufficiently strong to withstand the pressure. His plan is to utilize the time that Black will need to regain the pawn on c5, to take the initia- tive. 6 ... Ra5 (D) This is a key position for the 4 Bf4 system. Black does not have to worry about 7 cxd5, be- cause this allows 7,..Nxd5!, based on 8 Rxd5 Jcxc3+. There is in fact a forced draw in this line, a phenomenon not uncommon to sharp variations.

The trick is that Black then has At first sight this position may look rather boring and devoid of tension, but this is decep- tive.

all depends on whether White's pawn on d5 will prove to be a strength, keeping Black's po- sition under pressure, or a weakness, having given up control over the central squares e5 and c5. his knight is already on f3. White is not in a po- sition to consolidate his queenside by means of the manoeuvre e2-c3. Instead White has two main lines. He can ci- ther head for a transposition to the 5 e3 varia- tion with 6 e3 (6...c5 7 dxc5 Qa5 8 ficl dxc4 9 jlxc4 Rxc5) or he can play 6 Zcl. The latter move is intended to discourage Black from play- ing 6...c5 7 dxc5 Qa5?, for in this case after 8 cxd5 there are no conjuring tricks based on
8...Nxd5. A drawback of 6 Zcl is that it does
nothing towards the development of White's kingside. This makes the 'easy' solutions 6...c6 and especially 6...dxc4, which Black has thus far scorned, relatively more attractive than be- fore.

We have arrived at the starting point of this variation. It is true that 8 d2 exd5 9 I'e3+ forces Black to give up castling (9...sS?f8) but since White will need to spend a few moves on a re- grouping of his queen and knight, this should not unduly worry Black. Players who like a fixed pawn-formation often prefer the quiet 8 exd5 9 e3. This is in fact one of just a few variations in the Griinfeld where the pawn- structure becomes static and although this line is not considered to be particularly dangerous for Black, it is regarded as a godsend by many players who have trouble coping with the dy- namics and high-speed variations of the more popular lines. Finally White can also play the really quiet move 5 e3. Only in the early years was this line thought to be of theoretical importance, but it is still eminently playable if rather unambitious. If. after 5...O-O, White tries to prevent ...c5 by playing 6 b4, Black will simply prepare this ad- vance with 6,..b6. But the most important way of turning 4 <Bf3 into an independent variation by far is...

It is almost enough to make one believe that White has won the opening battle already! But if we go into the matter a little deeper and if we look at the vast amount of theory that has sprung into existence from this position over the years, we shall have to correct this op- timistic viewpoint. The resilience of Black's position is in fact phenomenal. Black has a GRtiNFELD DEFENCE 133 .hoice of no fewer than three plans (and per-

The real decision White has to take is whether he wants to continue calmly developing his kingside and allow Black to carry out his plan (8 Ae2), or if he prefers to take the initiative by playing 8 e5. This is not 'just' a question of what is best objectively, it is also to a large ex- tent a matter of taste. In case of 8 JaLe2, the position after 8,..b5 9 Qb3 (D) is the starting point. This move has not (yet) obtained quite the same rank in the hierarchy as the previous three moves, but it is perfectly playable nevertheless. The idea is to wait for 8 Jte2 before playing the Smyslov move 8...jlg4 and to meet 8 d5 with

will win back his pawn without much trouble. The question then is how much power remains in what is left of White's centre. If White plays 8 e5. the game becomes very complicated.

8 Sb3 is an entirely different idea. White
creates the possibility of taking on a6, ruining Black's pawn-formation on the queenside. This 'threat' has done little to deter Griinfeld devo- tees from playing 8...c5 though. After 9 d5 (the immediate 9 l.xa6 is met by 9...cxd4!) 9...e6 10 lxa6 bxa6, the pair of bishops and the open b- file more than compensate Black for the dou- bled pawns. This is a key position in the Prins Variation. Positionally speaking, the situation is very tense. The crucial factor is White's d-pawn.

By attacking the knight on f3, Black is undermining White's d-pawn. Besides, the 'threat' of taking on f3 adds some extra tension to the position. How should this exchange be judged? 8 le3 White can radically solve the question of the exchange on f3 by playing 8 eS, but because this knight sortie gives Black new targets for a counterattack, it has never been very popular. Black draws White's d-pawn forward by play- ing 8..Jte6 and after 9 d5 retreats the bishop to its original square (9...Jic8). Although the ma- noeuvre ...Js.g4-e6-c8 has resulted in no fewer than three extra moves for White, Black has ev- ery reason to be satisfied. He is ready to pounce on the white centre pawns with ...c6 and it will not be easy to prove that e5 is actually a good square for the knight. The simple developing move 8 .Ne2, although by no means bad, has never enjoyed great pop- ularity either. Most of those who study the Smyslov Variation come to the conclusion that, generally speaking, White does not have to be afraid of meeting ...jixf3 with gxf3 and that if he is, he had better give up the idea of playing 5 The classical way to protect d4 is 9 £dl.

for a proper evaluation of the Smyslov Varia- tion. Black plans to attack the white centre pawns with ...c6, ...e6 or ...f5, or a combina- tion of these moves. White has the option of launching an attack on the kingside with h4 and f4, but he will also have to react accurately to whatever scheme of counterattack his oppo- nent chooses. This situation is further compli- cated by the uncertain position of White's king

and with an eye to this problem, the alternative
9 O-O-O has been suggested (and played). Yet
this move too has its disadvantages. For one thing, with the white king committed to the queenside, the plan of playing 9...Nb6 10 'Bb? a5, followed by ...a4-a3, becomes much more attractive. Fianchetto Grunfeld

5 £11'3 is a major alternative. Now if 5...O-O 6 O-O. Black can switch to the solid 3...c6 line with
6...c6 or he can pursue his active strategy by
playing 6...dxc4. The usual response to this is 7 Qa3, when Black has two important schemes of putting pressure on White's central forma- tion. Both 7...Nc6 8 Nxc4 .e6, intending to meet the plausible 9 b3 with 9...jkd5 10 Bb2 a5, and 7...c3 8 bxc3 c5, creating a pawn- formation which is similar to the Exchange Variation, have left their mark on opening the- ory. I have already discussed the relative merits 5 ... Nxd5 (D) of this move and 3 3k3 in the chapter on the King's Indian Defence. In general. White's ap- proach in the g3 system is slightly more mea- sured. Rather than rushing forward to occupy the centre with a quick e4, White completes his development without giving his opponent un- due targets for a counterattack. Now, if Black wants to play a Grunfeld rather than a King's Indian, he has a choice between

Black does not let the absence of a white knight on c3 - which implies that he won't be able to respond to 5 cxd5 Nxd5 6 e4 with ...Nxc3 followed by ...c5 (as in the Exchange Variation) - discourage him from carrying out his aggressive plan. 5 cxd5 Again White faces a fundamental decision. Should he accept the challenge and play 6 c4 or should he prefer the quiet developing move 6 •Nf3? The answer to this question has been steadily rocking to and fro over the years and this is not because spectacular theoretical discoveries were

There has been a continuous process of ever more detailed and deeper analysis and ever more accurate assessments, which is con- tinuing to this very day.
6 e4 is of course the sharpest move. The re-
ply 6...<S b4 then forces the d-pawn to move forward because 7 <97162? would inn into the fork 7...jtxd4! 8 Nxd4? Rxd4 9 Rxd4 Nc2+. The advance 7 d5 allows 7...c6. opening lines for counterplay. On the other hand, the knight from b4 is likely to end up on the somewhat dis- appointing square a6. An alternative possibility is to play 6...9'Bb6, when after 7 <23e2 both 7...c5 8 d5 e6 and 7...e5
8 d5 c6 have been tested. In both cases Black's
pieces circle freely around White's pawn on d5, which itself, however, is firmly protected and poses a latent threat. These positions are diffi- cult to evaluate. By playing 6 <2ff3, White pursues his strat- egy of sound development and ignoring Black's provocations. In fact, this position is doubly important because it often arises if White plays Nf3 much earlier; e.g., 1 Nf3 or 1 d4 Nf6 2 Nf 3. The basic starting position is reached after

The resulting position will be rather static, which is unusual for a Griinfeld. Never- theless it is a very important option for every Griinfeld player for, in its own modest way, it constitutes a critical test of the g3 system. Does White have a constructive plan against this solid plan? And even if the answer is 'yes', is this the type of middlegame that he really wants? Is he not sorry7 to have lost the chance for playing one of the much more aggressive and dynamic lines starting with 3 £fc3? For many players who like the g3 variations against both the King's Indian and the Griinfeld De- fence, these are pertinent questions. Of course Black may be troubled by similar pangs of conscience. Do I go all-out for my usual Griinfeld or King's Indian or am I (secretly If White now plays 9 d5, the reply 9...Qa5 is considered Black's best move. The knight is not standing offside on a5.

7...41g4!, indirectly attacking d4.
If White protects his c-pawn, for instance by 6 £}bd2 or 6 b3, Black will have an easy scheme of development: 6...O-O, 7...Jlf5 and 8...£te4. This is playable of course, but practice has shown that the real test of Black's set-up lies in the only concrete solution to the problem that is available to White: 6 cxd5 cxd5 (D) Now, is this symmetrical position really White's best chance against 3...c6 or is it just plain boring? Unfortunately, and perhaps not surprisingly, there is no more honest answer to this question than 'both'. This is in fact White's dilemma in a nutshell. If he wants to play the theoretically most critical strategy against Black's ...c6 plan, he must have the motivation and the technical skills to play a 'boring' position, that is a posi- tion which is all about small advantages, subtle GRttNFELD DEFENCE 139 The subtle 8...e6 9 O-O Q>fd7, intending to play ...£k:6 only after White has weakened his pawn-structure by playing 10 f4. has come to the fore as the modem interpretation of this variation. the Benoni. this is the only way to try to prove that 3 f3 is too slow and that White really needs the f3-square for his knight. 3 ...

This unsophisticated little move has a very odd status. If Black plays l...Nf6 and 2...g6 with the idea of playing a King's Indian, he has no prob- lem whatsoever. He will simply play 3...Ag7. when 4 c4 d6 5 Nc3 brings about a Samisch Variation (sec page 97) as if nothing has hap- pened. Another transpositional possibility is lo play
3...c5. This reply to 3 f3 is likely to come natu-
rally to the Benoni expert. It is only when Black wants to play a Griin- feld, that 3 1'3 is the starling point of an inde- pendent opening variation. This makes it in effect an anti-Griinfeld move: While does noth- ing to avoid a King's Indian, but he specifically steers clear of the 'normal' main lines of the Griinfeld Defence. Paradoxically though, the Griinfeld move 3...d5 is also the real test of the soundness of 3 f3, for unless we consider the Samisch as a second-rate choice against the King's Indian and the f3 system as harmless in This is the critical position of the 3 1'3 varia- tion. White has an aggressive and natural scheme of development in 8 Qd2, followed by O-O-O and an attack on the kingsidc (h4 and ilh6). Black will have to be careful not to fall in with this plan. Swift counterplay against White's centre is needed; e.g., 8...£te6 9 O-O-O e5 10 d5 2kl4. 8 1'4 is an important alternative. While 'cor- recting' his pawn-formation, he frees f3 for the knight and strengthens control over c5. Now S.-. cb forces the d-pawn forward (if 9 <2)f3 the reply 9...Jlg4 will force 10 d5 anyway) when after 9 d5 Na5 or even 9...Nb8, Black is ready to play 10...c6, attacking White's outpost on d5. This variation is generally considered the most critical test of 3 f3. Benoni and Benko
1 d4 2>f6
2 c4 c5 (D)
The Benoni is characterized by ...c5, a move that may be played in many different positions. It started in the 19th century with 1 d4 c5 and the most modem version is to play ...c5 only af- ter White has committed himself to a particular scheme of development; e.g., 1 d4 Qf6 2 c4 e6
3 g3 and now 3...c5. The move-order adopted in
litis chapter is the most universal one, keeping as many strategic options open as possible. The name Benoni is somewhat ominous, for it is Hebrew for 'child of sorrow'. Far from be- ing a cry of despair by a player who has just lost his third game in a row with this opening, how- ever. this name is the result of a bizarre little twist of history. 'Ben-oni' is the first word of a much longer title of a general book on chess openings which was published in 1825. Among many other things, this book dealt with the consequences of 1 d4 c5. For some totally ob- scure reason the word Benoni then got stuck to this particular opening, eventually becoming its official name which was later extended to include the more modern version of 1 d4 <2}f6
2 c4 c5.
3 d5 (D)
The most principled approach. White ac- cepts the challenge and occupies a large portion of terrain in the centre. It is only with this move that we enter the Benoni proper, for the alterna- tives 3 €11'3 and 3 e3 take us into a different kind of position and even into a different opening al- together. 3 4Bf3 is a direct transposition to a line of the Symmetrical English (see page 212), while
3 e3 may transpose to a Panov Caro-Kann af-
ter 3...cxd4 4 exd4 d5 (see page 378) or to a Queen's Gambit after 3... d5 or 3...e6 4 Nf3 d5.
3...g6 is another good reply and one that is
more Benoni-oriented. 3 dxc5 is rarely played. Whatever 2...c5 is, it is not a pawn sacrifice. Black wins back the pawn quite effortlessly by playing 3...e6. The chapter on the King's Indian Defence has already taught us that this move constitutes a standard way of attacking White's pawn- centre. The Benoni is closely related to the King's Indian, especially if Black develops his bishop on g7, as he does in most Benoni varia- tions. The main difference is that by playing
2...g6 Black keeps his pawn-formation as flexi-
ble as possible, while 2...c5 is a choice in favour of the immediate clarification of the central pawn-structure. But clarity is not the same as simplicity. The Benoni often leads to enormous complications, perhaps because it is in fact already a sacrifice to play 2...c5: a positional sacrifice of space. Since the simple reply d5 gives White a stable spatial advantage in the centre, Black takes upon himself the obligation to play the opening and middlegame with the utmost vigour, espe- cially in the more modem variations. He will have to seize every opportunity to take the ini- tiative, often at the cost of material sacrifices. In short, the Benoni is a very combative open- ing, tailor-made for the truly uncompromising fighter.

3 ... g6(D) An uncomplicated developing move, delay- ing the decision of what to do about White's spatial advantage to a later stage.

This will usually transpose; e.g., after 4 4k 3 g6 5 e4
B
In this position Black has no fewer than four variations at his disposal, all with a totally dif- ferent strategic background. The oldest interpretation of the Benoni is to play 3...g6 (or 3...d6 4 43c3 g6). Of all Benoni variations, this is the one that is the most closely related to the King's Indian Defence. Though dating from the early 19th century, it is still a highly topical line. During the 1920s and 1930s it was consid- ered more modem and stronger to close the centre with ...e5. This resulted in the variation
3...e5 being developed, which is now called the
Czech Benoni, whereas the Modem Benoni re- fers to the much more dynamic approach 3...e6. The latter very sharp and double-edged interpre- tation of the Benoni rose to fame in the 1950s and 1960s, mainly due to the brilliant successes of world champion Mikhail Tai (1936-92 ). With his exceptionally dynamic style, he proved to be the perfect ambassador for this opening. It is hardly an exaggeration to say that it was Tai who taught the world to play the Benoni. But in the meantime, an even more modem variation has sprung up: the pawn sacrifice
3...b5, When this line was in its infancy it was
seen as an obscure and dubious side branch and it was called Volga Gambit. It reached maturity when around 1970 the Hungarian- American grandmaster Pal Benko came up with a new and much more profound interpretation. Nowa- days it is usually called the Benko Gambit, and rightly so. because Benko's ideas have turned it into a sound opening that offers Black unusu- ally good winning chances. 4 43c3 What makes this variation a difficult one from White's point of view is that he has to an- ticipate all three of the above-mentioned plans. A transposition to the Modem Benoni with ...e6 in particular is something which has to be care- fully weighed and rhe first (and perhaps most crucial) aspect of such an evaluation is whether a transposition is acceptable to White or whether there is a chance for something better. An interesting option to make ...e6 possibly less attractive is to fianchetto the king's bishop, when ...e6 (and also ...e5 for that matter) can be met by taking on e6, opening a beautiful diago- nal for the bishop on g2. Now, an important fi- nesse of this plan is that an early 43c3 is best avoided. After 4 <53c3 Jig7 5 g3 O-O 6 Jig2 d6 7 <2)f3 e6 (or 7...e5), for example. 8 O-O exd5 9 cxd5 will simply transpose to the Fianchetto Variation of the Modem Benoni (see page 151 ) but if 8 dxe6 Jcxe6 9 43g5, the exchange sacri- fice 9... .xc4! 10 .xb7 43bd7 1 1 J.xa8 Qxa8 is considered very promising for Black. But if
142 FUNDAMENTAL CHESS OPENINGS
White delays Nc3 in this set-up; e.g., 4 g3 Ja.g7
5 Bg2 d6 6 O-O 7 O-O e6, then 8 dxe6 j.xe6
9 Ng5 jlxc4?! 10 ±xb7 Qbd7 11 Na3! (D) is
very good for White. Alternatives are usually played with a transpo- sition to the Modern Benoni in mind. For instance, most players who prefer 6 f4 will be counting on 6...O-O 7 <Nf3, when 7...e6 8 jLe2 exd5 9 cxd5 transposes to the Four Pawns Attack of the Modem Benoni (note that Black has thus avoided the dangerous Taimanov At- tack - see page 147). However, Black has an important alternative in 7...b5 8 cxb5 a6. This pawn sacrifice is similar to the Benko Gambit but there is no literal transposition. Still, a gen- eral knowledge of that opening will help to cope with the specific problem of this line. Af- ter 9 bxa6 Ra5 10 Bd2 Jtxa6 White should not underestimate the difficulties; 9 a4 is better.
6 f3 also allows a transposition to the Mod-
ern Benoni, for instance with 6...O-O 7 Jce3 e6 8 Nge2 exd5 9 cxd5. Here 7 :i,g5 is slightly more aggressive, but it will not prevent 7...e6. It is true that White can then play 8 Qd2 exd5 9 Nxd5, which perhaps looks very promising, but the pin on the f6-knight turns out not to be a problem for Black if he just continues 9...jte6 10 'Ne2 Bxd5. For this reason most players prefer the 'orthodox' 9 cxd5. Another possibility is 6 Be2 O-O 7 Jkg5. which is a direct transposition to the Averbakh Variation of the King's Indian Defence (see page Hl).
6 ... O-O (D)
But then again, and just to show how compli- cated such a choice of variation really is: play- ing 4 g3 also requires a willingness to play the Fianchetto Variation against the Benko Gambit, for if, after 4 g3 J.g7 5 J.g2 d6 6 Nf3, Black plays 6...b5, there is nothing for White but to accept the gambit and transpose to this line with 7 cxb5 a6 8 bxa6 Axa6 (see page 157). And this transposition, in its turn, is ruled out by 4 <Sc3. 4 ... Bg7
5 e4 d6 (D)
6 Qf3
This healthy developing move offers best chances for a specific anti-3. ,.g6 strategy. the One of the advantages of 3...g6 over 3...e6 is that after 7 Ae2 White's development runs less smoothly here. The point is that, after 7...e6 8
BENONI AVP BENKO 143
O-O, Black is in absolutely no hurry to take on d5 (8...exd5 9 cxd5 would take us straight into the Classical Variation of the Modern Benoni; see page 149), since he has an excellent waiting and preparatory move in 8...Ne8. It then be- comes difficult for White to keep on anticipat- ing a transposition to the Modem Benoni. while at the same time he has no obvious alternatives. If (by analogy with the Modern Benoni) he plays 9 Nd2, Black increases the tension with
9...?)a6. If he plays the natural developing move
9 Bf4, he will have to recapture on d5 with his
[diagram]
to a fairly quiet position with few problems for Black. The idea of 7 h3 is to get precisely this type of position (with White having played exd5 in- stead of cxd5) in a more favourable version. 7 ... e6 8 ±d3 (D) O-O! .xe3 12 fxe3, and after 12...Exe3 13 Qd2 fie8 14 Rh6 White is already close to winning. Black does better not to accept the sacrifice and to play 12...Nbd7, but even then the open f-filc and the weakened dark squares on the kingside are ample compensation for the backward e- pawn. Black's dark-squared bishop is badly missed. This does not mean that there is anything wrong with 'the other capture' 9 cxd5. In fact, this is played quite often because it transposes to a highly popular line against the Modem Benoni. The choice between 9 exd5 and 9 cxd5 is to a large extent a matter of taste. Opening theory can be useful though in helping a player to make up his mind and in determining which particular circumstances favour the one pawn- formation and which favour the other. Czech Benoni 3 ... e5 Black barricades the centre, leaving only the flanks open for future action.

5 e4 Ne7 (D)
This brings us to the most important starting position of the Czech Benoni. Of course 5...g6 is also a good move. Play then assumes a King's Indian character. But by playing 5... .e7 Black pursues a dif- ferent goal, one that is more specifically at- tuned to the blocked central pawn-formation. He intends to play ...O-O and ... eS. While ...g6. to prepare ...f5, remains fully possible, White's piece development is directed to- wards minimizing the impact of some of Black's standard options in the pawn-formation that arises after 8...exd5 9 exdS. 8 Bd3 is intended to prevent the simplifying manoeuvre ...2e8 followed by ,..'21e4 (which we have just seen in the 7 Jle2 variation) and to discourage ...Ji.f5. The alternative active development ...Ag4 has already been ruled out by 7 h3. On the face of it, this set-up seems to offer Black one particularly attractive possibility, namely 9...2e8+ 10 Ne3 Nh6 (D). But closer inspection reveals that White can turn this into a promising pawn sacrifice: 11
144 FUNDAMENTAL CHESS OPENINGS
White's last move anticipates 1 l...f5. which can now be met with the annoying 12 5)g5. Things usually develop at a leisurely pace in this type of position. Black can calmly play ...lfrh8 followed by ...Ndf6-g8 to drive away the bishop from h6, before turning his atteniion to playing ...f5. In the meantime White will play b4 and open a file on the queenside. Nevertheless, once the battle gets started, this may lead to sharp play, especially on the kingside. If White prefers to try to smother Black's at- tack on the kingside before it even gets started, he may consider a scheme of development like 3Ld3, h3. g4 and perhaps O-O-O. starting, for in- stance. with 6 Bd3 O-O 7 h3 51e8 8 4t)f3 (to stop

Black also creates the option of playing ...Bg5, exchanging the dark-squared bishops, which will make his slightly cramped position more comfortable. Strategically, the situation is perfectly clear. While Black will concentrate on the advance ...f5 (and in some cases ...b5), White will start an attack against the enemy fortress with b4 or f4. But it is not always easy to execute even a clear enough plan satisfactorily. In fact White faces something of a dilemma in this variation: should he concentrate his forces entirely on the queenside or should he first try to neutralize Black's attack on the kingside? And if he de- cides to allow Black to play ...f5, how should he react to this move? The most classical piece development is 6 Nf3 O-O 7 Ae2, when 7...Qe8 8 O-O <Nd7 (or

1 1 Rd2 (D) is a characteristic (though by no means forced) continuation. Although a quick ...f5 is not physically im- possible, it is decidedly less attractive now that White may well be the one who profits from an opening of the g-file. But this strategy makes high demands on White. In the long run it is far from easy to combine anticipating ...f5 on the one side and making the desired amount of progress on the queenside on the other. At any rate this set-up too usually results in a very complicated mid- dlegame. RiMlASA Modern Benoni 3 ... e6(D) With this move Black is heading for the ex- change 4.,.exd5 5 cxd5.

Both ...f5. ...h5-h4 and even ...g5-g4 can be very useful plans under the right circumstances. Move-order is an important aspect of play- ing the Modern Benoni. Many players prefer
2...e6 to 2...c5, choosing to play a Benoni only
if White plays 3 Nf3 or 3 g3 (3...c5), when White's choice of variation is restricted (after 3 1Nf3 he will be unable to play a f4 or f3 varia- tion. while after 3 g3 White is committed to the Fianchetto Variation). Against 3 Nc3, which does keep all options open in case of a Benoni (3...c5 4 d5), they then play either a Nimzo- Indian (3... jLb4) or a Queen's Gambit Declined (3...d5). But there is also a variation of the Benoni that is specific to 2...e6 3 £tf3: the Blumenfeld Gambit. After 2...e6 3 Nf3. Black plays 3...c5 and if White accepts the challenge to play a Benoni (4 d5), he lashes out on the queenside with 4...b5 (D). Black is sacrificing a pawn, hoping to gain a pawn-majority in the centre himself. sharp plan because what Black is doing here is in effect raising the positional stakes, which were already quite high after 2...c5. After the exchange on d5. White will not only have a spatial advantage but also a pawn- majority in the centre, something he can only dream of in many other openings. And this does not even come at the price of immediate tactical complications, as is the case in many gambits. White will have no problems in completing his development whatsoever. So what is it that makes this opening worth- while for Black? For we are talking about a re- spected opening here, not to everyone's taste certainly, but in the hands of an expert as fully playable as the more classical defences against 1 d4. It is hard to find words to describe the power and dynamism of Black's strategy. The best way to discover them is to study a number of classic Modern Benoni games in their entirety, for instance the games of world champions Mikhail Tai and Garry Kasparov. Again and again in these games White's pawn-centre turns out to be not only strong and potentially very dangerous for Black but also vulnerable, some- times rigid, sometimes no more than a sitting target. Moreover, Black's pawn-majority on the queenside plays an important role in this open- ing. The advance ...b5, often in combination with ...c4, can be very threatening, especially when supported by the powerful bishop on g7. White may easily come under heavy pressure on the queenside, which will automatically lessen Although this gambit has never reached the pinnacle of respectability, it has always had its loyal devotees and it should not be underesti- mated. White faces a fundamental decision. If he ac- cepts the gambit by playing 5 dxe6 fxe6 6 cxb5 he will be in for a dangerous fight against a shad- owy and intangible enemy initiative. But if he
146 FUNDAMENTAL CHESS OPENINGS
maintains the Benoni pawn-structure the situa- tion is equally unclear. The most popular move is 5 jLg5, hoping for the meek reply 5...bxc4, when 6 Q)c3 or 6 e4 will consolidate the cen- tre, but Black has stronger moves in 5...h6 and
5../S'a5+. In fact opening theory has little grip
on the Blumenfcld Gambit. This makes it an at- tractive opening for some and unattractive for others. In any case the Blumenfeld requires some independent thinking from both sides. 4 4hc3 exdS 5 cxdS d6 (D) Attack, 7 f3, which is more of a consolidating move, and 7 the most classical set-up. which keeps a fair amount of options open and which is considered by many to be the main line of the Modern Benoni. 6 $Bf3 is slightly more subtle, but of extra im- portance because this position is often reached via an earlier Nf3; e.g., 2...e6 3 <9)f3 c5 4 d5 exd5 5 cxd5 d6 6 <2k:3. After 6...g6 White can still play 7 e4, but he also has 7 g3. the Fian- chetto Variation, and 7 J,f4, which is a very concrete attempt at disorganizing Black's plans. Four Pawns Attack
6 e4 g6
7 f4 Ng7 (D)
The fact that this has been called the Four Pawns Attack makes it sufficiently clear that this is not a variation for the insecure and the hesitant. Yet it is not just the bold and the ag- gressive who like this variation, it is even more the domain of those who simply feel at home in deeply analysed opening variations, where there is relatively little room for surprises and where good preparation offers potentially rich rewards. This is the main starting position of the Mod- em Benoni. In the course of half a century, many variations have sprung up from this posi- tion (and many have disappeared again). The most obvious move is to play 6 e4 (D). White has three possibilities in this position. The sharpest move is 8 e5. This is the Mike- nas Attack. After 8...dxe5 9 fxe5 Nfd7 10 e6 Black will have to be very careful not to get smashed, but the immediate 8...423fd7 is consid- ered a solid reply. Without the exchange of pawns on e5. the thrust 9 e6 loses its edge After the thematic 6...g6 White then has a choice between the sharp 7 f4, the Four Pawns

(Black simply replies 9...fxe6 10 dxe6 51b6) while 9 exd6 O-O cannot possibly be a justifica- tion for White's aggressive opening play. Much more to the point is the pawn sacrifice 9 *jb5. yet even here Black's defences appear to be strong enough after 9...dxe5 10 4jd6+ Se7 1 1 Qixc8+ Qxc8. in spite of the exposed position of Black's king. Slightly more self-restraint is shown by 8 a line that is particularly important as it often arises from the King's Indian Four Pawns Attack (the 8 e5 and 8 Bb5+ lines are unique to the Modern Benoni move-order). The start- ing point of this popular variation arises after
8.~O-O 9 _le2 (D). <2Bxe4 Qa5+. Here too the consequences of 10
e5 dxe5 1 1 fxe5 ?)g4 are critical. But White's most dangerous weapon is prob- ably the Taimanov Attack: 8 Jl.b5+ (D). Black now has the fairly solid 9...Jkg4 100-0 4ibd7, keeping the advance e5 in check, but he also has the more direct 9...2e8, attacking e4. It is then White's turn to choose between the re- spectable 10 <2)d2 on the one hand and the sharp 10 e5 on the other. The latter boils down to a pawn sacrifice after 10,..dxe5 1 1 fxe5 <2)g4. because White cannot protect his pawn on e5. After 12 Bg5 Rb6 13 O-O (D) the utmost will be asked of both players' talent for coping with dynamic and highly tactical situations (and a certain amount of theoretical knowledge will also come in handy!). For example. 13...Nxe5 14 d6 or 14 Nxe5 J,xe5 15 J.c4, when White's attacking chances against the enemy king and his powerful d- pawn compensate for the material deficit. An even sharper option is to play 9...b5, based on the tactical point 10 Bxb5 <hxe4! 11 The point of this check is not obvious at first sight, but if we investigate a little deeper, it is not hard to understand why this line is thought to constitute the perfect middle way between the aggression of 8 e5 and the sound piece de- velopment of 8 Nf3. The point is that the two most plausible re- plies, 8... bd7 and 8..dLd7, are now met very strongly indeed by 9 e5. Black is thus more or less forced to play the anti-developing move
8...4hfd7 (though it must be said that die-hard

Be2 h5 leads to the same position that we have seen above as arising from 8 Be3. Just as in the Samisch Variation of the King's Indian Defence. White consolidates his central position and prepares to play either ->"e3 or A,g5. There is no immediate confrontation here, yet in the long run play can easily become just as com- plicated and sharp as in the Four Pawns Attack. Because of this slightly more relaxed alti- tude (Black has in effect complete freedom to develop as he pleases), move-order in this line is not all that important.

Classical Variation
8 Ae2
White develops his kingside rapidly and sim- ply. The most important starting position arises after...
8 ... O-O
9 O-O (D)
9...He8 is the classical move in this position.
White then plays 10 Qd2, not just to protect e4 but also (and this is the main strategic point of White's plan) to manoeuvre this knight to c4 in due course, where it will occupy an excellent post, exerting strong pressure against d6. Black has two ways of developing his queen's knight. 10...Qa6 and 10...Nbd7. which arc equally important but very different in charac- ter. 7 21f3 This is probably White's most natural devel- oping move. White seizes the opportunity to play e4, but the emphasis of his opening play is on completing his kingside development. Strangely enough, even though theory has worked its way far into the middlegame in this line, it has as yet failed to establish what the most accurate move to start this variation is! Apart from the move-order given here, the can- didates are 7 i.d3. 7 h3 and 6 4Bf3 g6 7 h.3 or 7 '5\12. depending on which of the two main lines (as outlined below) White intends to play. The idea of all these moves is to avoid ... .g4. but

move, like 12 Rc2, but this allow's Black to stop 1 3 f4 by boldly playing 12,..g5. It then be- comes a matter of carefully manoeuvring and waiting for a favourable opportunity for both sides. White will be looking at moves like Qdl- e3 or 2el followed by Qfl-e3 to keep control over f5. Black will be interested in further king- side expansion with ...g4 or ...£3h5-f4. More recently, the idea of playing ...±g4, al- ready mentioned above, has come to the fore as an important alternative. This plan is normally preceded by 9...a6, a move which, without be- ing strictly necessary, usually comes in handy for Black. Like in most cases where Black plays ...a6, the reply 10 a4 (to stop 10...b5) is practi- cally forced. Now Black plays 10... Ji.g4 (D). After 10...<£ja6 1 1 f3 4bc7 the battle revolves around the advance ...b5. There are many intri- cacies to consider. If White continues 1 2 a4. then the straightforward 1 2...a6 allows White to carry out his basic strategic plan: 13 <2jc4 with a very good position. Much more subtle (and stronger!) is 12...b6, planning to meet 13 'Ac4 with 13....Na6. A characteristic follow-up is 14 Jfcg5 h6 15 jLe3 Axc4 16 Axc4 and only now does Black play 16..,a6 (followed by 17...Rd7). Thanks to the exchange "Bxc4, White will now find it much harder to prevent ...b5. With 10.-SLbd 7 (D) Black chooses a strategi- cally much more complicated plan, envisaging to make a forward move not on the queenside but on the kinaside. Black is aiming for a strategically uncom- plicated middlegame. If White plays 11 <2)d2 he will reply H...jLxe2 12 Rxe2 ?)bd7, when his position is easier to play (compared to the
9...Ne8 lines) thanks to the exchange of a mi-
nor piece. Most players prefer 11 Jlf4, when

Black simply plays 15...Qbd7, when his position is solid. Modern Variation
8 h3 o-o
9 ld3 (D) This line came into fashion around 1990. It grew up very quickly and is now one of the most important lines of the Modem Benoni. Whereas in the Classical Variation, White's play centres around the manoeuvre <2)d2-c4, the Modern Variation is based on taking opti- mal advantage of the position of the knight on f3, where it is excellently placed to control both the e5-square and the kingside. That is why h3 is essential (to prevent ...Bg4 and also the ma- noeuvre ...4bg4-e5 in combination with ...4t)d7) and why the bishop goes to d3, where it covers e4 so that Nd2 is not necessary. Black has tried all sorts of plans. He can simply play a few developing moves, like 9...a6 10 a4 Nbd7 11 O-O He8, but the downside of this relaxed attitude is that it also allows White to complete his development at his leisure, for instance by 12 Zkl or 12 aif4.
9...He8 10 O-O c4 is an attempt to hinder this
easy plan of development. White now has to make up his mind whether to take on c4 and try to prove that he has an advantage after 11 Bxc4 Nxe4 12 <?Bxe4 2xe4 (and now 13 jlg5 or 13 White is a pawn up but Black has the initia- tive and there are good prospects of regaining the pawn, for instance after 13...Qa6 14 S)2c4 Q>d7 15 O-O 2)b6.

on ...Nbd7; e.g.. 9...a6 10 a4 5)bd7. In this posi- tion White has played 11 e4, 11 jLf4 and the classical 1 1 Nd2. This last move in particular has been heavily analysed, and leads to surpris- ingly sharp play. After 1 l...Se8 12 h3 Sb8 13 $Ac4 Black has two ways of combining the de- fence of d6 with an attack against the well- placed knight on c4: 13...Nb6 and 13...?)e5. This latter move creates enormous complica- tions if White responds ambitiously with 14 5)a3, threatening 15 f4 followed by a return of the knight to c4. Now 14...<Nh5 turns the posi- tion into a highly explosive one. Black plans to meet 15 f4 with 15...Nxg3! and. even sharper and very surprisingly. 15 g4 by a piece sacrifice:
15...' rh4!. Both lines are very dangerous for
White and it is probably wise to play the solid 15 e4 (D) instead. as some of the sharper variations. In most cases White will play e4 anyway, but at a later stage and in a situation where the pawn will be safely protected by the bishop on g2. This strategy gives Black few targets for a swift counterattack. The Fianchetto Variation is also important for adherents of the Catalan Opening, who like to meet 1 d4 <21f6 2 c4 e6 with 3 g3 and who need an answer to 3...c5. They have a choice of

Anyone not wishing to enter (or to study!) these sharp lines will probably be more inter- ested in 7...a6. which avoids such complica- tions. Now the routine reply 8 a4 (the alternative is to play 8 e4, allowing 8...b5, which is looked upon as rather unclear) gives Black the oppor- tunity to play 8,..alg7 without being troubled by a check on a4. This is likely to transpose (or be very similar) to the Classical Variation after, for instance, 9 e4 Bg4. Benko (or Volga) Gambit 3 ... b5 (D)

forces the reply 8...Bd7, when after 9 ft>3 (D) a critical position is reached. The two different names for this gambit not only reflect its historical background. They also express a fundamental difference in interpreta- tion of this suiprising pawn sacrifice. 'Volga Gambit' is the older name. It dales from a time when 3...b5 was played with the in- tention of following up with ...e6, trying to break down White's pawn-centre. This idea bears a strong resemblance to the Blumcnfcld Gambit, which I briefly discussed earlier in this chapter. But around 1 970. Pal Benko demonstrated a totally different way of looking at the position after 4 cxb5. It was then (or, to be more pre- cise: a few years later, when his ideas were duly recognized and appreciated) that 3...b5 was promoted from 'a dubious gambit' to a fully-fledged opening and that it was renamed the Benko Gambit. Strictly speaking, we are talking about two different openings here, but the Benko version The initial reaction by Black was to play

White then has plenty of lime to develop his pieces very actively. Especially after 10 e4 O-O 1 1 <5Td2 it is not easy for Black to get rid of (he pressure.

is completely predominant these days. Never- theless, the spirit of the old Volga Gambit still lingers in the shadows. The breaking-down of White's pawn on d5 by means of ...e6 remains an important strategic motif. Especially in those lines where White does not take on a6 after 4 cxb5 a6, the earlier version of this opening is still recognizable. The Benko Gambit occupies a place of its own within the Benoni complex. It is a pure sacrifice. Black is not giving up a pawn in the hope or even the certainty that he will regain his lost material; his sole intent is to take advantage of the positional pluses that compensate for the missing pawn. Remarkably, these pluses are of an almost entirely positional nature. Despite the fact that the game starts with a pawn sacri- fice, play does not usually become unduly sharp or tactical. What is asked of Black, then, is mainly a psychological quality: he should not feel un- comfortable with his slight material deficit. 4 cxb5 Over the years many attempts have been made to avoid this move and steer the game in a different direction, but without success.

Blumenfeld Gambit (see page 145).
4 a4 has also been tried. While refusing to
accept Black's pawn sacrifice. White does in- sist on clarifying the situation. Here too 4...b4 is a good reply, but 4...bxc4 also becomes more attractive now that White has weakened his pawn-structure on the queenside (having given up control over b3 and b4). 4 ... a6 5 bxa6 In this position, however, White does have some fully acceptable alternatives. To begin with, refusing the gambit by play- ing 5 b6 (D) is an option. turn the pawn in such a blunt way and in a posi- tion where it seems so natural to take on a6, but one who has been made to feel the strength of the Benko Gambit may well appreciate the fact that there will be no bishop on a6 and that the a-file remains closed. In fact. White often takes the initiative on the queenside himself in this line. After 5...Rxb6 6 Nc3 d6 7 e4 g6, for in- stance, 8 a4 is a popular move, forcing Black to decide whether he wants to allow 9 a5, seri- ously cramping his queenside, or to play 8...a5, giving up the b5-square. Either way Black will not be able to get the kind of active play on the queenside that he is expecting in a Benko Gam- bit. An alternative is to play 5...e6. in the spirit of the old Volga Gambit that we shall consider later on. It is a sound enough move, but not ven- pow- erful. White is hoping for4...bxc4, when 5 followed by 6 e4 leads to a more 'normal' Benoni-type position, but Black has some ex- cellent alternatives. He can either play 4...b4, depriving the queen's knight of its natural square

5 e3 is another important alternative. This
:oo may seem a bit clumsy at first sight, but it is a far more profound move than it looks. While accepting the sacrifice. White concentrates on neutralizing Black's initiative on the queenside, rather than going for a quick c3 and e4. This line was particularly popular in the 1980s and it can easily lead to very complicated positions indeed, especially if Black decides to put him- self in 'refutation mode' by launching an all-out attack against d5: 5...axb5 6 jlxb5 Ra5+ 7 •Nc3 jLb7 ID). When theoretical developments in the 5 e3 line finally slowed down a little around 1990, another variation became popular: the sharp 5 f3 ID). White returns the pawn to build up a strong pawn-centre. One critical position arises after

Benko Gambit strategy simply to play 5...g6 6 e4 d6, without worrying whether this is perhaps relatively better for White than the 5 bxa6 main Unes, a difference which is very hard to assess in any case. 5 ... J.xafi The decisive factor in understanding the Benko Gambit, which it has been Pal Benko's outstanding merit to unearth, is that there is absolutely no need for Black to hurry. By open- ing the a- and b-files, his counterplay on the queenside has already started, unnoticed by anyone! The original idea of the Volga Gambit was to eliminate d5 by playing 5...e6. hoping in due course to play ...d5, so that it would in the end be Black who occupies the centre. However, this plan is less likely to succeed here than in the Blumenfeld Gambit, because after 6 <Nc3 exd5 7 <Nxd5 <Nxd5 8 Qxd5 Nc6 9 e3 White has no trouble in completing his kingside de- velopment. Now, if 8 Jed 2 Rb6 9 Rb3 Black has the powerful 9...e6, when the obvious reply 10 e4 runs into 10...Nxe4! 1 1 Nxe4 Axd5. In this po- sition 12 Qd3 is the only move to keep every- thing protected but Black then has not only
12...f5 but also 12...Qb7 (the idea being to meet
13 f3 with 13...c4! 14 Bxc4 ±xc4 15 Qxc4 d5
and Black regains the piece), with tremendous complications in both cases. In order to avoid this chaotic situation, 8 <2Be2 has been tried, giv- ing up d5 without a fight but hoping to take ad- vantage of White's slight lead in development. If Black plays 5...g6, things are less confus- ing. Black makes no attempt to refute 5 e3 and simply adopts a normal Benko strategy. After 6 £fc3 Jlg7 7 £jf3 O-O, for instance, 8 a4 is a characteristic move. White is hoping to prevent his opponent's usual counterplay on the queen- side by keeping a firm grip on the b5-square. In the long run. however, this plan is not without risk, because the weakness of b3 and b4 may make itself felt in the end.
156 FUNDAMENTAL CHESS OPENINGS
It is important to note that 5...Ji.xa6 is the original Benko move-order, which is given as the main line here for the sake of systematic clarity, but that 5...g6 is in fact the most popular move nowadays. The idea is to avoid the varia- tion 5...j"Lxa6 6 g3 d6 7 Jlg2 g6 8 b3. By play- ing 5...g6. the bishop arrives on g7 a move earlier, which makes 6 g3 d6 7 flg2 .g7 8 b3? unplayable due to 8...QJfd7. In practically all other cases, 5...g6 will simply transpose to the
5... .xa6 lines.
We now return to 5... .xa6 (D): two open files on the queenside form an excel- lent attacking base. Black's standard plan is: bishop to g7, rooks to a8 and b8, queen to b6 or a5 and perhaps a knight manoeuvre to c4 (e.g. ...<?3bd7-b6-c4), or - in case White plays e4 - to d3 (...'2Ba6-b4 or ...Ng4-e5). The latter aspect is already a clear indication that White's pawn-centre has lost a great deal of its usual strength now that the pawn on c4 has disappeared, and that it may even become a weakness. Not only is the d3-square a most un- pleasant Achilles' Heel in many cases, but the standard Benoni advance e4-e5 also loses much of its power now that the pawn on d5 is no lon- ger protected by a neighbour on c4. This means that Black has created attacking chances for himself on the queenside and reduced his oppo- nent's chances on the kingside and in the centre at the same lime! Besides, and this is perhaps the strangest aspect of the Benko Gambit, an exchange of pieces, normally a standard method of capital- izing on a material advantage, does not neces- sarily have the desired effect in this case. The structural advantages of Black's position do not fade away in the endgame. If anything, in many cases their importance only increases. Paradox- ically, this makes the Benko Gambit one of Black's safest openings not only of the Benoni complex, but of the entire range of 1 d4 open- ings. White has two main lines. The most popular one is to play 6 c3 followed by 7 e4. There is, however, no consensus as to the value of exchanging of bishops on fl. Many players prefer the Fianchetto Variation (6 g3), whereby White avoids the exchange and delays e4.

In spite of all the alternatives that have been developed over the years, this natural develop- ing move has always been White's most princi- pled reaction. 6 ... g6 7 e4 Now what does Black have for his pawn? This question had a sceptical ring to it before 1970, a troubling and urgent one when Pal Benko and his fellow pioneers started scoring point after point from this position in the 1970s, until it finally became an existential question when players on the white side started to be- come really desperate. Many of them simply could not understand why and how things went wrong for them time and time again. It is perhaps the Benko Gambit's greatest strength that it is so extraordinarily difficult for White to get a grip on it by means of concrete variations. That is why the alternatives 5 b6. 5 e3 and 5 f3 have become so important. They change the character of the game. As I have said before, the advantages of Black's opening play are of a positional nature. In the first place he has a lead in development, enlarged by the fact that the rook on a8 no lon- ger needs to be developed, its position on a8 al- ready being the best possible one. Secondly, the

White postpones e4 and avoids an exchange of bishops. The underlying idea is that with all his pieces still in play, Black will have some slight coordination problems. White is in effect trying to use his traditional Benoni space ad- vantage even in this position. 6 ... d6 W 7 Ng2 g6 ID) This is the most important starting position of this main line. Black is ready to execute the standard plan of playing 12...Qb6or 12...Ra5, followed by 13...2fb8. A modem variation on this theme is to play 12...fia6(or 12...2a7)and
13...Ra8. With a queen on a8, a pawn-break in
the centre with ...e6 becomes interesting. It will at least make the white king feel uneasy on g2. White's standard moves are 12 Sei and 12 h3 (preventing ...Ng4-e5). He will have to try to develop his queenside very cautiously. When discussing the relative merits of 5...g6 and 5...Jtxa6, 1 already mentioned the subtle al- ternative 8 b3. which is the reason why most players prefer 5...g6 these days. 8 b3 neutral- izes the dangerous bishop on g7. After 8...jLg7
9 Jlb2 O-O White will have to develop his king's
knight via h3, because 10 f3 Bb7 would
158 FUNDAMENTAL CHESS OPENINGS
leave the d-pawn very vulnerable (1 1 £k3 <2jxd5 being obviously not what White intended when he played 8 b3), but this should not be a prob- lem since there is an excellent square for this knight on f4. 8 ... jLg7 9 £bd7 (D) To prevent these manoeuvres, the idea was developed to play 10...'Tjb6 instead of 10...O-O. Not only does this prevent 1 1 Qc2, but also 1 1 Sbl is now dubious because of H... .c4! at- tacking both a2 and d5. This was rather disap- pointing from White's point of view because it meant that he would have to fall back on other schemes of development, like 11 fie1 O-O 1 2 e4, for which enthusiasm had never been over- whelming. At the start of the 21st century, however, the ingenious 10 Bbl (D) was discovered. This is the most important starting position for the Fianchetto Variation. Strategically the problems are the same as in the 6 *2hc3 line, but tactically there are some major differences. Initially 10 O-O was played almost unani- mously, with Black replying equally casually
10...O-O. For decades no one knew how White
should develop his pieces in this position until it finally became clear that 11 Rc2 followed by 12 Sdl is probably best. White plans to consolidate his queenside with Ebl, b3 and perhaps Ab2. With this conclusion firmly established, the im- mediate 11 Ebl followed by b3 turned out to be an equally sound way of carrying out this plan. Now White is just in time to meet 10...<21b6 with the simple 11 b3, preventing 1 )...jlc4. If ll...Ab7, White does not play 12 e4, which would be problematic after 12...Ba6, but 12 <23h4. This protects d5 and allows White gradu- ally to develop his queenside. An easing of the pressure on his position then finally comes in sight. Of course the knight is not well placed on h4. but if all goes well, this is a temporary draw- back only. Other 1 d4 W6 Openings they do not put any immediate pressure on the opponent, there are no problems to be solved. Things are different if White plays 2 <2k3, which is really like saying "I would like to play an 1 e4 opening after all, if you do not mind". If Black does mind and plays the most logical re- ply 2...d5 to prevent 3 e4, we find ourselves in the Richter-Veresov Opening (see page 55). 2 c4
2 c4 (D)
Generally speaking, the situation regarding White's 2nd-move options is much the same as in the position after 1 d4 d5. In the majority of games 2 c4 is played, intending to take com- plete control over the centre with 3 ?)c3 and 4 e4. Second place in the hierarchy is occupied by
2 Nf3, which may be intended either as the first
part of a scheme of development which does not include c4, or as a simple postponement of c4. In the latter case it is used as a clever ploy to avoid certain openings that are feasible only af- ter an immediate 2 c4, like the Benko Gambit and the Budapest Gambit.
2 Jig5, the Trompowsky Attack, is a wholly
different move. This relatively young opening has been particularly popular in Great Britain during the last three decades. Instead of jug- gling with ultra-subtle moves to reach a slightly more favourable version of this opening or to avoid a slightly inferior version of that varia- tion. White radically enters new territory. Other moves also leave the well-trodden paths of opening theory behind. Moves like 2 e3. 2 c3 or 2 A14 are certainly playable, but there is nothing to know about them. Because In the previous chapters we have discussed the consequences of 2...e6, 2...g6 and 2...c5, There are a few other possibilities which are not as popular as these 'major' openings, but which are quite interesting nevertheless. The soundest of these alternatives is 2...d6. the Old Indian Defence. Black wants to play ...e5, a solid positional motif which we have al- ready encountered in the King's Indian De- fence. Strictly speaking though, it is not necessary to make any preparations for ...e5, as is shown by the existence of the Budapest Gambit: 2...e5. Anyone happening to notice that this pawn is actually en prise will understand, however, that
160 FUNDAMENTAL CHESS OPENINGS
this radical opening is far from self-evident. Still, it is an attempt to grab the initiative that is not to be underestimated. It is in fact quite a fa- vourite with some players who like to provoke their opponents.
2...Nc6 (D) is also provocative, but in a dif-
ferent way. but his plan to create a foothold in the centre by playing ...e5 is based on classical principles. The Old Indian Defence has acted as a pre- cursor of the more dynamic King's Indian, where Black fianchettoes his bishop first and makes a decision about playing ...e5 later, de- pending on White's scheme of development. The Old Indian Defence is characterized by a more modest development of the dark-squared bishop: ...3Le7, which is why many theory books have labelled the Old Indian a passive opening. As usual such a label is inaccurate. It conceals a complex and fascinating reality. It must also be borne in mind that Black can still switch to a King's Indian by playing ...g6 in the next few moves, so White needs to take this into account when choosing his reply.
3 Nc3
White can temporarily prevent ...e5 by play- ing 3 *22sf3, reaching a position which also occurs quite frequently via 1 <23f3 or 1 d4 £tf6 2 £tf3. Though not a bad move. 3 <23f3 gives Black a few extra options that he does not have after 3 <2)03. Developing the bishop to f5 (3...jlf5) be- comes slightly more attractive now that White can no longer prepare a quick e4 with moves like f3 org.3 and Jig2, but 3...Bg4 is also quite interesting. 3...2jbd7 is the way to slick to the classical plan of playing ...e5. And of course.
3...g6 leads to King's Indian terrain with White
committed to an early 'S'if.3. 3 ... e5 (D) This straightforward move does not really have what can be called a disadvantage objec- tively, but some players do prefer to play the This opening is of recent origin, and has been dubbed the Black Knights Tango although the name is not universally used, but it can boast a steadily growing number of devotees. Here too, the idea is to play 3...e5 (after 3 23c3 for in- stance) but it also challenges White to play 3 d5. The idea is to reply 3...5)e5 followed by 4...e6, hoping to develop some serious counterplay by attacking the enemy centre pawns.
2...b6 is nameless yet this is a far older open-
ing than 2...Nc6. It is actually a rudimentary form of the Queen's Indian Defence, developed in the 1920s, but recently taken up again by some as a way to throw the opponent out of the theory books. After 3 <2)c3 Bb7, 4 <2)f.3 will transpose to a regular Queen's Indian following
4...e6. but While can take up the challenge by

3... ,f5 is a much sharper variation which
came into fashion around 1985. On the face of it. preventing e4 in this way seems totally point- less because what is Black to do now after the simple reply 4 f3? The point is that if Black now plays 4...e5, White is committed to 5 e4, which can be met with 5...exd4 6 'fi''xd4 5x6. followed by 7...A.e6. The tempo lost with ,.. .f5-e6 is compensated for by the attack on the white queen and an open, lively struggle, quite unlike the classical Old Indian variations, lies ahead. Another critical reaction to 3...jLf5 though, is to prepare e4 by 4 g3 and 5 Bg2. It is also not too late to transpose to a King's Indian Defence by playing 3...g6. more chaotic type of position than 4...'5hbd7. The crucial reply is 5 2)g5 Af5 6 g4. White eliminates the potential bridgehead on e4 at the cost of his g-pawn. This is the most important starting position of the Old Indian Defence. Three different ways for White to develop his position have grown into main lines.
5 e4 is undoubtedly the most natural move.
After 5...Ne7 White plays 6 ,S.e2 O-O 7 O-O, when 7...c6 followed by 8...a6. preparing ...b5, is the traditional plan for Black. It is not easy to start an attack against Black's very solid posi- tion. White's main weapon is to play d5 at some point. Some players prefer to adopt a King's In- dian set-up by 5...g6, seeking a transposition to a ...<bbd7 Classical (see page 105). Contrary to the situation in the King's Indian Defence, a fianchetto of the light-squared bishop does not fundamentally alter the character of the game in this case. If White plays 5 g3, the critical situation also arises after 5...Ae7 6 jLg2 O-O 7 O-O c6 8 c4 a6. On the other hand. 5 Jlg5 does alter the situ- ation. White radically prevents a belated switch to the King's Indian (5...g6? runs into 6 dxe5 dxe5 7 Nxe5!) while 5...jLe7 can now be met aggressively by 6 e.3 O-O 7 Rc2, when Black has to take a possible kingside attack, based on O-O-O and g4. into account. Budapest Gambit 2 ... e5 (D) 4 2>f3 This move keeps the tension in the centre in- tact, while attacking the pawn on e5. The main alternative is to play the endgame after 4 dxe5 dxc5 5 Rxd8+ Bxd8 6 4hf3, hop- ing to take advantage of the somewhat shaky position of Black's king on d8. Closing the centre with 4 d5. though cer- tainly not bad, is not likely to worry an oppo- nent who feels at home in the King's Indian Defence. After 4...g6 most players will feel that White has limited his options by having com- mitted himself to d5 so early. 4 ... bd7(D) The advance 4...e4 is critical for an evalua- tion of 4 4df3, but this is not often seen in tour- nament practice. It usually leads to a much

4 Nf4
The most level-headed way of temporarily hanging on to the extra pawn. The rather impulsive 4 f4, though providing radical protection for e5, does a lot of damage to White's pawn-structure and is probably ex- actly what Black would be hoping for. After
4..Bc5 5 Nh3 d6 there can be no doubt that
Black has sufficient compensation for the small material deficit.
4 Qd4 is less draconian, yet this too, like 4
f4, is a relatively rare bird in tournament prac- tice. Black's best answer is the uncompromis- ing 4...d6, giving top priority to fast piece development. Rather more important are two other moves that are based on a totally different strategy. White does not worry about defending his pawn on e5 and concentrates on developing his posi- tion quickly and harmoniously. Of these. 4 e4 ID) is certainly the sharper. What a contrast with the Old Indian move
2...d6 that we have just seen! Still, there is one
similarity between these two diametrically op- posed openings: they are of the same age. The Budapest Gambit was brought to the attention of the chess world around 1917, when several Hungarian players started using it to good ef- fect. Although occupying a relatively modest place in the opening books, it has always had its loyal devotees. Black is disturbing the positional balance and is looking to complicate the game by creat- ing tactical problems. However, these tactical complications will only arise if White goes for an all-out refutation of the gambit, especially if he decides to hang on to the extra pawn. If he behaves as if nothing has happened, returns the pawn and develops his pieces, the position will 'normalize' and White may be justified in count- ing on a small positional advantage. Anyone wishing to play the Budapest Gambit must be prepared (technically, but also mentally) for ei- ther of these approaches. 3 dxe5 <2}g4(D) Even sharper (and weirder!) is 3...4)e4. the Fajarowicz Gambit. Black is not concerned with winning back the gambit pawn and tries to unnerve his opponent by creating vague threats along the el-a5 diagonal instead. 4 Rc2 jkb4+ 5 £kl2 d5! 6 exd6 Bf5 7 dxc7 Rxc7 would be a dream scenario for Black, transforming the vague threats into an attack with the force of a hurricane. 4 Nf3 XJ.b4+ 5 Ad2 Nxd2 6 Nbxd2 Nc6 7 a3 .xd2+ 8 'xd2, 'normalizing' the position, is much more solid. OTHER 1 d4 <ty6 OPENINGS 163 After 4...Nxe5 White continues 5 f4, when
5...£ec6 (or 5...Ng6.) leads to a position where
it is unclear whether White's centre will turn out to be weak or strong in the end. 4 is a much more modest move. Black regains the pawn very easily with 4...Jlc5 5 e3 Nc6. Now 6 Nc3 £gxe5 7 A.e2 O-O 8 O-O, for instance, leads to a situation where Black will not find it so easy to get his teeth into his oppo- nent's position as after 4 e4. but he also has far less to worry about. 4 ... Nc6 The crazy-looking 4,..g5 is a move very' much in the spirit of the Budapest Gambit, but while this move makes it easier for Black to regain his pawn, the resulting gash in his kingside pawn- formation puts off all but the boldest or most reckless players.

9 Ne2 will give him an improved version of
the 4 £1'3 Jtc5 5 e3 line, because his dark- squared bishop is actively placed on f4, while its counterpart is not really being very useful on b4. 2
2 Nf3 (D)
This is the most important starting position of the Budapest Gambit. White faces a fundamental decision, reflect- ing his personal style and temperament. Black will have to feel at ease with either possibility.
6 Nc3 is the most ambitious move. White
safeguards his extra pawn, because 6...Bxc3+ 7 bxc3 Qe7 can be met with 8 Rd5. Amazingly, although this is one of the oldest variations of the Budapest Gambit, there is still very little theoretical clarity about this position. Black continues 8...f6 9 exf6 Nxf6 10 W3 d6 (D). White's weakened pawn-structure on the queenside and the many open lines for Black's pieces definitely compensate to a certain extent Most players will react to this move in the same way as they would to 2 c4. If you want to play a King's Indian or a Griinfeld, you will
164 FUNDAMENTAL CHESS OPENINGS
play 2...g6. If it is a Nimzo- or Queen's Indian you are thinking about, it will be 2...c6. But if you want to play a Benoni, things are different. If he so wishes. Black can play 2...c5 and turn this into an independent way of coun- tering 2 <2Bf3. In other words: this could be an attempt to 'punish' White for not playing 2 c4, because after 2 £tf3 c5 3 d5 Black has a few- possibilities that are not available after 2 c4 c5 3 d5. But if Black plays 2...c5, thinking that this is just another way of playing the Benoni. he may be in for an unpleasant surprise, because in that case White also has an important possibil- ity which is not available after 2 c4 c5. Very confusing of course, so both players will have to know exactly what they are doing. Another possibility for Black is to say good- bye to the I...?)f6 openings and play 2...d5. heading for a Queen's Gambit. This move- order (1 d4 jf6 2 ?3f3 d5 rather than 1 d4 d5) may be attractive to those who would like to play a Queen's Gambit, but who have a prob- lem with certain variations that are only avail- able to White after I...d5 and not if the game starts 1 d4 A)f6 2 Nf3 d5. For instance, if 3 c4 e6 4 <2k3 Be7 White no longer has the option of playing the strongest subvariation of the Ex- change Variation of the Queen's Gambit De- clined (see page 22), or, in the Queen's Gambit Accepted (3 c4 dxc4), the variation 3 e4 (see page 40) is not available in this move-order. 2 2)f3 g6 2 ... g6(Di Now it is White's turn to lay his cards on the table. If he still does not want to play 3 c4, with- out excluding the possibility of transposing to either the King's Indian or the Griinfeld De- fence by playing c4 on one his next moves, he might want to consider 3 g3. If White has made up his mind to steer clear of these 'major' openings, he has 3 Nf4. 3 .g5, or - excluding an early c4 rather emphatically -
3 Nc3.
2 2rf3 g6 3 g3
3 g3 (D)
This is a modern and subtle variation, which is mainly intended to confuse an opponent who wants to play a King's Indian Defence. White leaves his opponent guessing whether he will play c4. The most important starting position arises after 3...jLg7 4 jlg2 O-O 5 O-O. Now, if Black plays 5...d5. White does not really have a fully fledged alternative to 6 c4, which is a Griinfeld (sec page 1 36), although 6 4?\bd2 is sometimes played. But against 5...d6, the King's Indian set-up, there are a few alternatives to 6 c4 (see page 1 14) that need to be taken very seriously. For instance, White can play 6 Nc3, intending to transpose to a line of the Pirc Defence with 7 e4. or he can play 6 b3. choosing a set-up which does not give Black the usual King's Indian tar- gets for a counterattack, but without entirely giving up the option of playing c4 at a later mo- ment.

aggressive because it introduces the possibility of Jcxf6 and because it challenges Black to re- ply with sharp moves like ...Ne4 or ...h6. With a bishop on g5, many players feel that they can do better than a quiet set-up based on e3. After 3...Bg7 4 Nbd2, with possible ideas of e4. Black can prevent this advance altogether with the solid 4...d5. or he can try 4...O-O. Then the straightforward 5 e4 can be met by 5...d6 6 c3, when 6...4t)bd7 7 Bc4 e5 and 6...c5 are both ways to attack White's centre in true King's Indian spirit. He can also seek to show up White's central advance as premature by playing 5...d5!?, meeting 6 e5 with 6...$)e4. Therefore White often plays the slower 5 c3, when Black can again choose between 5...d5 or 5...d6. This is a set-up that we have already consid- ered in the chapter on 1 d4 d5 2 £}f3. White leaves the well-trodden paths of opening theory and chooses a simple and sound scheme of de- velopment for his pieces. It is a variation par excellence for those who do not have the time or the inclination to study opening theory. But this does not imply that this is a low-level varia- tion ! In fact it is popular at all levels. Even a top player sometimes feels the need for a day with- out heavy opening preparation. Black can react in several ways. The first thing that comes to mind is to play a quick ...e5 in order to make the bishop feel unwelcome on f4. For instance, after the natural continuation
3...Ng7 4 e3 O-O 5 ±e2 d6 6 O-O, Black can
play 6...Nbd7 7 h3 (to prepare a retreat-square for the bishop) 7...Qe8, when 8...e5 is unstop- pable. Another healthy idea is to play ...c5; for example. 6...c5 7 c3 b6 8 Nbd2 -4.b7 and Black develops his kingside first before com- mitting himself to any form of action in the centre. 2 £rf3 g6 3 Jlg5 3 ±g5 (DI The same can be said about the difference be- tween this move and 3 .wJ4 as I already did in the coverage of 1 d4 d5 2 Nf3.

White is confronting his opponent with the same decision as in the variation 3 jLg5 Ag7 4 Qbd2 above: should he allow e4? Naturally, with a knight on c3 blocking its own c-pawn. playing 3...d5 becomes much more self-evident. This brings about a kind of Rich- ter-Veresov Opening (see page 55). White's scheme of development is 4 jfi.f4 Ji.g7 5 e3 O-O 6 -Be2, often followed by a timely Ne5.

To begin with, this move forces Black to think about a possible e4. It is not easy to judge whether a variation like 3...h6 4 Jkxf6 Qxf6 5 e4 is good for White because of his perfect pawn-centre or for Black thanks to his pair of bishops. The same goes for 3...b6 4 e4 h6, forc- ing 5 Nxf6. Though of a different nature, the problem of how to assess 3...d5 is also quite difficult, as we have seen in the section on 1 d4 d5 2 ?rf3 ?Bf6 where this position was reached via 3 Bg5 e6 (see page 53). All these variations occupy their legitimate place in the books (and in practice), yet the most popular move has always been the flexible and aggressive... 3 ... c5 White cannot treat this as a Benoni. because 4 d5 is not an option. Nor is 4 e4 a serious move, now that Black can simply reply 4...cxd4, meet- ing 5 c5 with 5...h6 6 .i.h4 g5.
4 e3 (D)
Again, White has a choice of several alterna- tives to 3 c4. The longest standing of these is 3 Jtg5. the Torre Attack. Unlike most of the 2...g6 varia- tions given above, this line has been researched and charted fairly well. 3 i.f4 is a more reserved move, emphatically avoiding any sort of mainstream theory.
3 g3 is of much more recent origin than these
two bishop moves. As in the variation 2...g6 3 g3, White plays a subtle game of 'threatening' to play c4 at some point, transposing to other open- ings, most notably in this case the g3 variation of the Queen's Indian Defence and the Catalan. Last but not least, the deceptively modest lit- tle move 3 e3 combines elements of the other three variations. It is solid, yet not without poi- son and there are several transpositional subtle- ties that need to be taken into account. This is the starting position of the Torre At- tack. The variation is named after the Mexican player Carlos Torre, who celebrated many tri- umphs with it in the 1920s, including a famous win over world champion Emanuel Lasker in
1925. which continued 4...cxd4 5 exd4 Jle7 6

and ended in the total annihilation of Black's kingside. This unmistakable attacking poten- tial in combination with the natural simplicity of White's opening play made the variation quite popular. It is not easy to disturb the execution of this scheme of development. 4...'sS'b6 is the sharpest attempt, resulting in a rather murky position af- ter 5 <£bd2 xb2 6 Nd3 (D). The point is that if 5...exd5 White simply continues 6 <Jc3, winning back the pawn, when White can be very satisfied about having cre- ated a nasty crack in Black's pawn-structure on d5. Black can play 6,..jib7, but after the contin- uation 7 Jlxf6 Qxf6 8 Nxd5 he cannot strike back with 8...aLxd5 9 Rxd5 Rxb2? because this would simply lose a rook after 10 Sdl . 2 2rf3 e6 3 Af4
3 Jcf4 (D)
It is absolutely unclear if White has enough compensation, but so many black players have fallen victim to this pawn sacrifice that it has become a variation 'for specialists only'. Most of the less well-prepared prefer a quieter move, like 4...jLe7, postponing the choice between a ...d6 and a ...d5 set-up. The light-squared bishop may be developed on b7, as Lasker did in the above game, but an immediate fianchetto with
4...b6?! is not to be recommended because of
the very surprising 5 d5! (D). Unlike 3 Ag5, this is a move which leaves the opponent a practically free hand. Here too the most popular reply is 3...c5, when 4 e3 Rb6 again leads to enormous complications, but almost any other scheme of development is equally feasible. Those who have no objections to a transposi- tion to the 4 ,f4 variation of the Queen's In- dian (see page 78) may want to play 3...c5 4 e3 b6 or 3...b6. 2 £rf3 e6 3 g3
3 g3 (D)
This can be an annoying move for players with a limited opening repertoire. Without an early c4, the possibility of a Bogo-Indian is ruled out, as are a number of Queen's Indian variations. To illustrate this, let us consider the implications of 3...b6 4 ,&.g2 ±b7 5 c4 (or 5 O-O Be7 6 c4). A standard position of the Queen's Indian has arisen, but only those who like to
168 FUNDAMENTAL CHESS OPENINGS
opening knowledge of both players. If White responds with 4 c4, the situation is relatively simple: 4...cxd4 5 $)xd4 will transpose to a line of the Symmetrical English (see page 213). The implications of 4 Jlg2 are more complicated. If Black then plays 4...<?)c6 5 O-O cxd4 6 Qxd4 Rb6, for instance, the situation strongly resem- bles the same line of the Symmetrical English, but because White has not (yet) played c4, the two are not identical and therefore difficult to compare. If Black plays 5...d5 (instead of 5...cxd4 in the previous variation), transpositions literally abound. To name just a few: 6 c4 dxc4 is a Cata- lan (see page 25), while 6...Be7 7 cxd5 exd5 is a Tarrasch Defence (see page 11). Finally, those who are not happy with any of these transpositions or who want to give the opening a face of its own may want to consider the 'improved Queen's Indian': 3...b5 (D). play the 4 g3 Ji.b7 lines of that opening as Black will be happy about this. The 4 g3 Jta6 variation, arguably the most important part of modern-day Queen's Indian theory, has been bypassed. The same goes for 3...d5. inviting a direct transposition to the Catalan Opening with 4 c4. If While plays 4 Ji.g2, delaying c4 for just a few moves, e.g. 4..J".e7 5 O-O O-O 6 c4, then a player who feels at home in the 4... ,e7 line of the Catalan (see page 25) does not have a prob- lem, but someone who only has a 4...dxc4 variation (see page 25) in his repertoire will be in trouble. Less clear in this respect are the conse- quences of 3".c5 (D), a move which we have come to recognize as being tailor-made for any situation where White cannot reply d5.
IV
Had Black ventured this bold advance on his first or second move, he would have had to face a quick e4 (or e3) with the bishop on fl opening the attack against b5 at once. Now that White has played 3 g3. practically committing himself to a fianchetto, it is not so risky to play ...b5. A similar idea can be seen in the variation 1 Qf3 Nf6 2 g3 b5 (see page 260).
2 e6 3 e3
3 e3 (D)
This line is closely related to the Queen's Pawn Game: 1 d4 d5 2 <2)f3 Nf6 3 e3 (see page In this case the juggling with transpositions to other openings continues, requiring a broad OTHER 1 a'4 Qf6 OPENINGS 169 54). White's idea looks very modest, yet in the long run he is not at all intending to avoid a sharp fight. His plan is to continue 4 Bd3, when he has a choice between c3 and 4ibd2, eyeing a possible advance in the centre based on e4. and a fianchetto of his queen's bishop. An interesting and possibly attractive feature of this line is that Black does not have a whole Jot of choice. 3...c5 is certainly a good start, but after 4 Bd3 his only realistic options are a set- up with ...d5 and one with ...b6. In the former case (an immediate 4...d5 for instance) the game transposes to the above-mentioned line of the Queen's Pawn Game. In the latter case, 4...b6 5 O-O JsLb7 gives White a choice between an im- mediate transition to the 4 e3 variation of the Queen's Indian Defence with 6 c4 (see page 88) or playing 6 5)bd2 or 6 b3 with a possible c4 continuing to hover over the board.
2 W c5
2 ... c5 As I explained in the previous chapter, the name Benoni has always been used rather loosely. In the majority of cases it refers to vari- ations arising from 1 d4 £}f6 2 c4 c5 3 d5, but there is a strong argument for calling any de- fence against 1 d4 which is based on ...c5 a Benoni. Be that as it may, 2 *53f3 c5 is the starting point for several interesting variations, some ancient and some modem, which cannot be reached via 2 c4.
3 d5 (D)
Apart from 3...e5??, which is clearly inad- visable here, Black now has the same candidate moves as in the analogous position after 2 c4 c5 3 d5. namely 3...e6. 3...g6 and 3...b5, Only the consequences are different. 2 £jf3 c5 3 d5 e6 Now 4 c4 transposes to the Modern Benoni (or a Blumenfeld if Black chooses 4...b5), but it is generally agreed that the critical test of this variation is 4 Nc3. White wants to take back on d5 with a piece, not with a pawn. This will re- sult. after 4...exd5 5 Nxd5 <2)xd5 6 Qxd5 and now, for instance, 6...Jke7 7 e4 O-O 8 Bc4. in a position where White may hope for a positional advantage thanks to his firm control over d5, the weak point in Black's pawn-formation. The whole variation would not be of theoretical
170 FUNDAMENTAL CHESS OPENINGS
interest though if it were simply to White's ad- vantage. What makes it potentially attractive for Black is that there is no white pawn on d5 cramping his position, as is the case in a 'regu- lar' Benoni. With moves like ...5)c6 and ...Be6 freely available. Black enjoys free and easy de- velopment for his minor pieces.
2 Nf3 c5 3 d5 g6
White may attempt to disorganize Black' s posi- tion by inserting 6 Ab5+. If Black tries to avoid this problem by playing 5...O-O, he needs to consider 6 c5.
2 f3 c5 3 d5 b5
3 ... b5 (D) 3 ... g6(Z)y This is in effect an attempt to punish White for not having played 2 c4. All the 2 S)f3 varia- tions that we have seen so far allow White, if he so chooses, to return to 'major' 1 d4 openings by playing c4 at a later stage. After 3...b5 such a return is considerably less self-evident, because although 4 c4 is certainly possible, it brings about a mere side-line of the Benko Gambit (see page 154). If W'hite has nothing better than this, then 3...b5 is to a certain extent an argu- ment against 2 -5Bf3. But White does have a good alternative. By playing 4 .g5, he threatens to regain control over the crucial c4-square. If 4... ,b7, then 5 Ji.xf'6 cxf6 6 e4 consolidates White's central position and Black's pawn on b5 will become an object of attack; e.g., 6...a6 7 a4. Black faces a dilemma here: should he protect his pawn on b5 where it will remain a target, or should he play 7...b4, giving White a beautiful square for his pieces (especially a knight) on c4? The same can be said about 4...Qb6: White replies 5 Nxf6 '#xf6 6 c3. to be followed by 7 e4.
4...4)e4 is definitely the sharpest and proba-
bly the most critical move. This takes the game A comparison with 2 c4 variations shows ap- proximately the same result as did 3...e6. While
4 c4 is a direct transposition to the Benoni. 4
$)c3 J.g7 5 e4 is seen as the most critical test of Black's opening. This is often called the Schmid Benoni. White is hoping that not having played c4 will offer him benefits like greater mobility for his light-squared bishop and a calmer situation on the queenside, where the enemy now lacks a target for ...b5 operations. Black is hoping that there will be less pres- sure on his position without a white pawn on c4. so that he will be able to develop his pieces comfortably and perhaps play ...e6 (or ...b5 anyway) at a later stage. A major starting position arises after 5...d6 6 jLe2 O-O 7 O-O <2)a6. If White now plays the natu- ral move 8 jLf4 Black will develop his queenside along the lines of 8... c7 9 a4 b6 and 1 0...Ji.b7. Curiously though, the theoretical problems do not just lie in this position, as the road towards it is equally uncertain and open for debate. OTHER 1 d4 fof6 OPENINGS 171 the true mark of a rebel opening. And it is still nothing like as overgrown with theory as the 2 c4 openings! Black's most important options are the solid
2...d5. the sharp 2...<2Be4 and the avant-garde
move 2...e6. Other moves, like 2...c5 and 2...g6, for in- stance. are definitely playable, but do not figure as prominently in practice (any more) as these three main lines.
2...c5 transposes to a position that we shall
consider under 2... 4 if White replies 3 d5 $'e4 4 ±f4, but 3 jLxf6 is also a critical test. After 3...gxf6 4 d5 Rb6 5 Qcl we find our- selves in a typical Trompowsky middlegame, full of tension, where it is quite unclear which is the more influential factor: Black's bishop-pair or the damage to his pawn-structure, which makes it harder for Black to become active in the centre than in a 'regular' Benoni.
2...g6 3 jLxf6 exf6 4 e3 and now. for exam-
ple, 4,..f5 5 c4 Bg7 6 '<Jc3 raises the same question, albeit in a slightly different form. In both cases it is very difficult to provide an answer, but what is clearly noticeable is that it is exactly in this evaluation that something has changed over the last thirty years. It used to be the players who dared to take up these varia- tions with the white pieces who were regarded as somewhat eccentric, whereas now playing them with Black is thought to be a bit strange. into virtually unknown territory, where both players will be facing unfamiliar problems. A position like the one arising after 5 J.h4 jLb7 6 Qd3 f5 is totally unlike Tegular' Benoni posi- tions and requires ingenuity and a high degree of alertness from both players. Trompowsky Attack 2 i.g5 (D) This move has been known for a long time. It was named after the Brazilian player Trom- powsky, who experimented with it during the 1930s and 1940s. But for about half a century all that could be said about 2 jlg5 was that it had a name but lacked a reputation (let alone a following). Until about 1980 the general idea was that Black needs no more than a few sound moves to show up the rashness of such an early development of the bishop. But during the 1980s the Trompowsky sud- denly gained an unheard-of popularity, first in Great Britain, then in the rest of the world. Lit- tle by little, vague positional judgements be- came more precise, clearly defined variations were developed and one by one all these 'sound moves' that Black had at his disposal turned out to be not quite so sound as had been thought. After about three decades of intense practical experience, the Trompowsky might now be described as on the one hand an open- ing like any other with a full-grown theoretical standing, while on the other it has retained something of that freshness and sparkle that is 2 ulg5 d5 2 ... d5(D)
172 FUNDAMENTAL CHESS OPENINGS
obligation. Unlike 1 d4 d5 2 5)f3 Nf6 3 -fi.g.5 Ne4, for instance. White will be in a position to chase back the knight with f3 after he has re- treated the bishop. Playing 2. has to be part of a plan.
3 .£.14 (D)
This is a safer square for the bishop than h4. In fact. 3 jLh4 has a few very unexpected drawbacks. To begin with: after 3...c5 4 f3 Black has the surprising rejoinder 4...g5. Since
5 Jig3 Qxg3 6 hxg3 would now leave White
with a rather miserable position after a move like 6...'Qb6, he is more or less forced to go for 5 fxe4 gxh4, when White's pawn-formation is just as badly damaged as Black's. Another way to bring about this type of posi- tion is 3...g5, when after 4 f3 gxh4 5 fxe4 Black not only has 5...c5 (transposing to the previous variation) but also 5...e5. Finally Black also has a more cautious plan for attacking the bishop on h4: 3...d5 4 f3 5)d6 with 5...€lf5 to follow. While accepting a possible doubling of his f-pawns, Black refuses to give up any territory in the centre. Now. although White may equally well play the neutral move 3 e3, the most im- portant starting point of this line arises after the principled reply:
3 Bxf6 exf6
Although 3...gxf6 is also perfectly playable, the open e-file and the compact mass of pawns on the kingside make Black's position very solid after 3...exf6. Apparently this is what most players expect of 2...d5. because this is by far the most popular choice.
4 e3 (D)
B
In this position 4...Nd6 is usually played. If White then chooses the classical Queen's Gam- bit strategy of playing 5 c4, the reply 5...dxc4 6 Jcxc4 O-O 7 Nc3 again confronts us with the question of what is more important: Black's bishop-pair or White's central pawn-majority? In this case the position is fairly open, which in principle favours the two bishops, but on the other hand While's pawn on d4 gives him a strong hold on the centre. Again, it is hard to decide which is the more important of these two factors. Some players prefer a more modest approach, like 5 g3 c6 6 Jtg2 f5 7 4jd2 4Bd7 8 4Ae2, keeping c4 in reserve. Now Black has to lay his cards on the table. The most solid move is undoubtedly 3...d5. but if White is willing to sacrifice a pawn with 4 f3 W6 5 e4. even this will lead to sharp play. White is in effect playing a Blackmar-Diemer Gambit (see page 46) with the extra move jLf4 thrown in for encouragement. If White leaves the chance of playing f3 unused, the game will take a much quieter course; e.g.. 4 e3 Bf5 5 jLd3 e6 6 &3d2 4}xd2 with few complications. Generally speaking, the positions arising from 3...c5 are much harder to evaluate, let
2 Jlg5 e4
2 ... Ne4 A logical and aggressive reply to White's second move, but it does put Black under an OTHER 1 d4 Qf6 OPENINGS 173 alone to play. It 4 do Black has the sharp reply
4...Rb6, forcing his opponent to choose be-
tween a passive defence of b2 and an unclear pawn sacrifice (5 <9Td2). If 4 f3 Black could try to disrupt White's pawn-formation even further by inserting a check on a5. The idea is that after
4...Ra5+ 5 c3 Nf6 6 d5 the surprising 6...#b6
(D) again forces White to make a tricky deci- sion, this time with the added attraction of a hidden trap.
2 Xg5 e6
2 ... e6 A modern move, combining the soundness of 2...d5 with the dynamism of 2...Ne4-. In fact Black is giving liis opponent a taste of his own medicine here, for White is now confronted with a radical choice between a quiet move like
3 e3 or 3 '<Jd2, or the principled reply:
3 e4 h6
4 Bxf6 Qxf6 (D)
The aforementioned trap is 7 Rd2? Qxd5 ! 8 Rxd5 Rxb2, winning material. Nevertheless, White can still hope for a 'normal' opening ad- vantage if he quietly defends his b-pawn with 7 b3 or even 7 JLcl. In fact, this bizarre anti- development move very nicely illustrates the central idea of 2 Bg5: White provokes his op- ponent and challenges him to think for himself at an unusually early stage of the game. Even if White is forced to retreat his bishop to cl within just a few moves, the resulting position may well be very hard to evaluate. Has White simply lost time or has he provoked Black into some useless moves with his queen and knight? Again a perfect paw n-centre is facing battle with a pair of bishops. Black has managed to keep his pawn-structure intact (no doubled pawns), but for the time being at least he has no influence in the centre whatsoever. This too is a variation that makes high de- mands on both players. Theory offers very little support. After 5 5)f3 a position arises that is also of relevance to the Torre Attack, 'where it is reached via 1 d4 f6 2 Qlf3 c6 3 jNg5 h6 4 Jixf6 Rxf6 5 e4. However, many Trompowsky players prefer the more aggressive 5 <2)c3, leav- ing the f-pawn free to advance. Dutch Defence 1 <14 f5 (D) the Dutch city of The Hague in 1789, in which
1..T5 as a reply to 1 d4 is warmly recom-
mended. During the whole of the 19th century, the Dutch was considered to be the alternative to 1 ...d5, until Steinitz and Tarrasch started teach- ing the basic elements of modern-day positional chess to the world and the Queen's Gambit De- clined became the one and only correct opening. The Dutch Defence, along with many others, was taken up to the attic, from where, in the course of the 20th century, it found its way back to the tournament halls only with great diffi- culty. Many antiquated variations had to be re- moved or cleaned up thoroughly before the Dutch was presentable again and able to com- pete with modern alternatives, like the 1 d4 4T)f6 openings. Special credit should go to Botvinnik and Bronstein, who both made a decisive con- tribution to the revival of the Dutch Defence. In their match for the world championship in 195 1 it even was the most important opening'. Since then a new and dangerous weapon has been added to Black's arsenal: the Leningrad Variation, in which Black fianchettoes his king's bishop. This line became popular around 1980 and it has yielded some excellent results. 2 g3 Fianchettoing the bishop has become the most popular way of developing the kingside over the years. This makes the Dutch Defence the only 1 d4 opening where a set-up based on 2 c4 (and in many cases 3 cS) is not the main line. This is to a large extent a matter of flexibil- ity. By playing 1 ...f5 Black makes it clear that he is not going to challenge White's superiority in the centre (at least not immediately) and there- fore it is not necessary for White to strengthen that central position by playing 2 c4. The prob- lems confronting White are more of a long- term nature: how do I develop my position in such a way as to be optimally prepared for all In a way, the Dutch Defence is the equivalent of 1 e4 c5, the Sicilian. Whereas 1...c5 is the natural alternative to 1...e5 as a reply to 1 e4. in that both moves prevent the formation of the ideal pawn-centre with 2 d4. 1 ...f5 is the 'other' way of preventing 2 e4 if White plays 1 d4 and has been so since times immemorial (or at least long before l...Nf6 was taken seriously). Both the Dutch and the Sicilian can be said to avoid a direct confrontation in the centre, i.e. in the one case 1 e4 e5 2 f4 and in the other 1 d4 d5 2 c4. But while giving White a free hand on one flank, Black, in return for this generosity, emphatically claims domination on the other flank. This is a bold approach and just like the Si- cilian, the Dutch Defence is considered a sharp opening. Black avoids symmetry' and rapid ex- changes and he makes no attempt to maintain a positional balance. Without worrying too much about what the opponent is doing. Black goes for his own chances. In short, this is an opening for the true fighter. The origins of the name Dutch Defence are shrouded in mystery, but they probably go back to a book by Elias Stein that was published in
DUTCH DEFENCE 175
possible plans that Black has at his disposal'? The fianchetto of the light-squared bishop has proved its worth in this respect. From g2 the bishop will strengthen White's control over the important squares e4 and d5 and it will put pressure on the enemy queenside. It will also protect the white king if he decides to castle kingside. which is the most plausible choice in most variations. White will proceed to develop his queensidc depending on Black's plan. In the Stonewall, for instance, it definitely has its ad- vantages to keep the queen's knight on bl for a while, while in the Leningrad Variation, the move c4 is often postponed or even not played at all. Notwithstanding all this. 2 c4 4til'6 3 <2hc3 (D) remains a sound option. has denied himself both an aggressive develop- ment of his dark-squared bishop to f4 or g5 and the subtle Ja.a3. If White plays 4 <bf3, the Nimzo-Indian move 4,..Ji.b4 becomes slightly more attractive because White can no longer play 43e2. A completely different treatment of the Dutch (if not a maltreatment) is to open the centre right away by playing 2 e4 (D), the Staunton Gambit. This radical strategy, sacrificing a pawn to try to obtain the initiative, was popular in the 19th and early 20th centuries but since then it has faded into the background. Still, Black has to be prepared for this approach. The situation is far more dangerous than in the Blackmar- Diemer Gambit, because the absence of a pawn on f7 makes the position of Black's king rather insecure. If, for instance, after 2...fxe4 3 <2k3 $3f6. White plays the straightforward 4 f3, defending e4 with 4...d5 5 fxe4 dxe4 6 Jlg5 Jlf5, no mat- ter how insignificant that pawn on e4 might seem, is considered much more solid than the fearless 4...exf3, unreservedly accepting the ex- tra pawn but allowing White fast and easy de- velopment for his pieces. In order to eliminate this defence, 4 3Lg5 is a more common move. Black will then have to say goodbye to his pawn on c4 because 4...d5? 5 jLxf6 exl'6 6 Rh5+ would be decidedly coun- terproductive. Instead, the provocative 4...'23c6, intending to meet 5 f3 boldly with 5...e5 and 5 d5 calmly with 5...Ne5 6 Qd4 W7, has a good As is the case after 2 g3 <Sf6 3 .g2, Black then has to make a fundamental decision as to how to structure his position. If Black is thinking about a Leningrad set- up, he faces the question of how dangerous the sharp attack 3...g64 h4!? is. The idea is to meet
4...jLg7 with 5 h5 €jxh5 6 e4. Theory is still
largely undecided on this line. Black may try to avoid the problem by playing 3...d6. waiting for a neutral move like 4 <Nf3 before commit- ting himself to 4,..g6. If Black is envisaging a ...e6 set-up, he can play 3...e6 straightaway without any fear. Now 4 e3 d5 (with positions that are often reached via the Queen's Gambit: e.g., 1 d4 d5 2 c4 e6 3 41c3 c6 4 e3 f5) produces a relatively favourable ver- sion of the Stonewall Variation because White

reputation. The simple 4...e6 5 >5)xe4 Be7 is also considered reliable. The preparatory move 2 Nc3 started its ca- reer as a by-product of some one and a half centuries of analytical attempts to improve the results of the Staunton Gambit, but nowadays this sideline is considered the more important of the two. It is also a way of forcing Black to show his intentions. If he wants to stop e4, he will either have to play 2...d5 or 2...?)f6 3 Xg5 d5, but this characteristic pawn-structure (which we shall discuss more fully in the section on the Stonewall Variation) is not to everyone's liking. The alternative is simply to allow e4, for in- stance by playing 2...>5)1'6 3 Bg5 e6, when 4 e4 fxe4 5 Nxe4 Jle7 produces the same position with which we rounded off our discussion of the Staunton Gambit above. 2 ... <5)f6 3 ,tg2 (D) Although the Dutch Defence could well be called a robust opening, the earliest stage of the game is marked, to a surprisingly high degree, by positional subtleties and perhaps even more so by profound move-orders. For instance, in this position it is totally un- clear whether 4 3 or 4 c4 is the more accu- rate move, while even the rather eccentric 4 <2)h3 (D) is a serious option. It all revolves around the question of how White is going to tackle both ...d6 and ...d5 in the best possible way. Black's oldest plan, not surprisingly called the Classical Dutch, is a scheme based on ...d6 and ...e5, similar to the Leningrad Variation. The sturdy ...d5 is called the Stonewall Variation. This system first be- came popular in the days of Botvinnik (the middle of the 20th century) and enjoyed a re- markable revival during the 1980s, very largely based on the idea of putting the bishop on d6 rather than e7, and with some new ideas of playing on the queenside and in the centre. Thus some positional judgements of the Bot- vinnik era were changed or altered. A develop- ment of the king's knight via h3 and f4 (and perhaps d3). for instance, used to be thought highly of against the Stonewall but to present- day Stonewall adepts it is little more than a mi- nor inconvenience. That is why the old books strongly recommend 4...d6 against an immedi- ate 4 <2)h3. and it is indeed a useful idea, but to- day some players prefer to reply 4...d5 anyway. For the same reason Black used to approach
4 c4 (D) with waiting tactics (except of course
In this position Black faces a fundamental decision.
3...c6 is the oldest move. Black can then
build up a central position with ...d6 or with ...d5. His dark-squared bishop is likely to find a place on the a3-f8 diagonal. 3...g6 is of more re- cent origin. Black develops his bishop on g7 and prepares to attack White's central bastion with ...e5. This is the Leningrad Variation.

when he intended to play 4...d6 all along), keeping the option of playing ...d5 open until White had committed himself to a square for his king's knight. There are now two main lines. By playing 4...dS Black goes straight for the Stonewall Variation, while 4...jLe7 postpones the choice between ...d6 and ...d5. According to the latest insights, however, d6 is a better square for the dark-squared bishop than e7, so al- though 4...Jke7 may well result in a Stonewall, I use this move in this book as a preliminary step for a set-up with ...d6 only. This is called the Classical Dutch.
B
Stonewall Variation 4 ... d5 (D) For instance, he might first developing the kingside: 4...Be7 5 Nc3 O-O. In this way Black preserves the possibility of meeting Qh.3 with ...d6 and other knight moves with ...d5. How- ever, this also means putting the bishop on e7. rather than on d6, and so does not fit in with the modern Stonewall. So if Black does delay ...d5, then it is likely to be by 4...c6, with ...d5 and ...Ji.d6 normally to follow, hoping to have en- couraged White to commit himself to a less- than-ideal move in the meantime. However, these are relatively minor questions of move- order to the modern Stonewall player, whose motto seems to be "you do whatever you like; I play the Stonewall''. We now return to 4 Nf3 (D)\ The term 'Stonewall' is not so much used for a particular move-order, but for the pawn- formation as it now (almost) stands: pawns on d5 and f5, supported by pawns on e6 and c6. This formation can hardly be called flexible, but it is strong, very strong. In almost all of the
1 d4 openings, the central advance e4 plays an
important part, either as a way of occupying the centre or in order to open a second front, for in- stance after first having started an attack an the queenside. But against pawns on d5 and f5 this plan is well-nigh impossible to achieve. Because of this, the battle assumes a wholly different character. In general White will have to manoeuvre very patiently before he gets a chance of becoming really aggressive. In these manoeuvres the e5-square plays a pivotal role. Black has voluntarily conceded pawn control over this square; that is the price he has paid for stopping e4. But what use is this to White? A
178 FUNDAMENTAL CHESS OPENINGS
random knight jump Ne5 will be neutralized by a move like ...Nbd7. Is 'control' over e5 no more than control over a few square inches of air? It is here that patience and positional under- standing play a crucial part. White must cau- tiously take the initiative somewhere, most likely on the queenside, and by threatening to plant a knight on e5 in connection with this initiative, he may finally be able to put effec- tive pressure on the enemy position. This is a case where the old wisdom 'the threat is stron- ger than its execution' is fully applicable. And what will Black be doing in the mean- time, silting safely behind his medieval fortress walls? In the 19th century the answer would have been: Black leaves his opponent to do whatever he likes on the queensidc, while he himself plays for mate on the kingside with moves like ...Rc8-h5, ... e4, ...Sf6-h6 and ...g5. This plan should not be underestimated even today, but if things were really that simple then probably 1 d4 would have gone out of business a long time ago. Later the manoeuvre ...Bd7-e8-h5 came into fashion. This is a slow but sound way to make the bishop useful in the struggle fore5, creating the positional threat of ...Bxf3. The most modern plan, and the real reason for the Stonewall's renewed popularity, is to fianchetto this bishop. After Black has played ...±d6, ...b6, ...±b7 and ...5)bd7, White has to reckon with the counterattack ...c5. Black is not remaining passive on the queenside any more, and his 'stonewall' actually turns out to have some flexibility. A good understanding of these general stra- tegic aspects of the Stonewall is really much more important than knowledge of concrete variations.

6 O-O Jcd6 (D)
This position may well be called the (mod- em) starling point of this opening system. White now has all kinds of healthy moves, like 7 ,bd2. 7 5k3 and 7 Qc2, for instance, yet the most popular one is 7 b3. If Black then simply plays 7...O-O, White will continue 8 Ji.a3.
IV
An exchange of dark-squared bishops lessens Black's control over e5 and must be considered to be to White's advantage even when the ef- fects will only be felt later on in the game.
7...i 'e7 is widely regarded as Black's best
move. This is a very natural way of preventing aka3. After 8 Bb2 O-O 9 ?ibd2 a typical situa- tion is reached by 9...b6 10 Ne5 Bb7, where the subtle manoeuvring begins. Will White be able to find an opening somewhere? Is Black going to play ...c5? But a plan based on 9... .d7 is still equally feasible. Another idea is to play 7 Bf4. This way of exchanging bishops is more forcing but also riskier, because the doubled pawns resulting from 7...Jixf4 8 gxf4 (D) make While's king- side position less flexible and slightly vulnera- ble as well. In fact, it was the discover}' that this type of position is quite playable for Black that caused
DUTCH DEFENCE 179
... jLd6 to become popular in the first place, thereby freeing the way for a lasting revival of the Stonewall. Stonewall Variation. Consequently the Classi- cal Dutch has always been a favourite of play- ers who like dynamic positions with plenty of concrete variations to calculate.
7 Nc3 Re8 (D)
This is a standard move in the Classical Dutch. During the 1970s, 7...a5 used to be pop- ular, paying attention to the queenside first, be- fore trying to take the initiative on the other side of the board. Unfortunately, this allows White rather a free hand in the centre. Against 8 fiel, threatening to play 9 e4. Black has little better than 8...'5)e4, when 9 S'c2 forces Black either to take on c3 (which will not stop e4) or to sac- rifice a pawn with 9...Nc6!? 10 <2)xe4 Nb4 1 1 Wbl fxe4 12 'Q'xe4 and now the equally spec- tacular and logical 12...e5, based on the idea that after 13 dxe5 Bf5 the white queen is in some trouble. Whether this variation is correct or not (theory does not think so), it is an excel- lent illustration of the character of the Classical Dutch, which tends to lead to some very sharp fighting. Classical Dutch 4 ... Ne7

6 c4 (16 (D)
Here too 6...d5 is perfectly possible. This was in fact the standard way of reaching the Stone- wall until about 1985. On the whole, all strate- gic considerations and evaluations are the same as when Black plays 4,..d5 and 6...Jcd6. but the dark-squared bishop is simply less active on e7. This becomes visible, for instance, if White plays 7 b3. With a bishop on e7. Black does not have ...Re7 and is unable to prevent 8 jLa3. By playing 6...d6, Black keeps his pawn- structure flexible. After due preparation, ...e5 might be played. The plan of stalling an attack on the kingside by means of ...Qe8-h5 (as in the Stonewall) is another option. The crucial difference from the Stonewall is that without ...d5, White has the opportunity of breaking through in the centre. The opening stage is thus likely to revolve around White threatening to play e4 and Black threatening to play ...e5. At the same time Black must keep an eye on another possible breakthrough: d5, es- pecially in positions where he does not have the chance of replying ...e5. Tactical subtleties play a major role in this line, much more so than in the rather static This is the most important starting position of the Classical Dutch. Here too, a straightforward approach with 8 Sei is considered critical for a correct assess- ment of both sides' chances, but Black can now play 8...Ne4 9 'Qc2 Rg6, which is not possible in the 7...a5 line. The immediate 8...Rg6 may also look good, but it does not stop 9 e4, be- cause after 9...fxe4 10 Qixe4 53xe4 11 Sxe4! Rxe4? 12 <2)114! Black loses his queen. Instead of ll...Qxe4, however, Black has the simple
180 FUNDAMENTAL CHESS OPENINGS
developing move 1 1 ...<23c6, when it is uncertain if White has actually achieved anything. The alternative method of preparing e4. 8 Rc2. also runs into an interesting tactical sur- prise: if Black continues 8...Qh5 he will be able to meet 9 e4 with 9...e5 because of 10 dxe5 dxe5 1 1 Nxe5 fxe4, when the white knight on e5 comes under attack.
8 b3 is the most flexible approach. White
creates two excellent squares for his dark- squared bishop (b2 and a3) before embarking on an e4 plan. A characteristic point of this line is that after 8...Qh5 9 Ba3 a move like 9...a5, though logical enough in itself, is strongly met by 10 d5. This is the perfect moment for this ad- vance because the 'desired' reply 10...e5 unex- pectedly loses a pawn to 1 1 Nxe51. Leningrad Variation 3 ... g6(D) exert strong pressure against White's queen- side. The name 'Leningrad Variation' contains a little bit of political history for the development of this variation started in the Soviet Union, in particular in Leningrad, the city which is now St Petersburg.
4 Stf3
Here too, developing the knight to h3 is a perfectly viable alternative to the rather more classical 4'ff3. While can either play 4 f3h3 immediately or
4 c4 Bg7 5 Nc3 O-O 6 Nh3 (D).
The idea is to meet the thematic 6...d6 with the equally thematic 7 d5. offering White's king's knight the prospect of jumping to f4, from where it will eye Black's weak point e6 very menacingly. But, however logical this plan may be, it has never really seemed to worry Black. By plainly showing his hand at such an early stage, White gives his opponent a clear plan of counterattack, based on utilizing the squares e5 and c5 for his knight. Black can sim- ply play ...e5 regardless, if necessary in connec- tion with ...c6; e.g.. 7...<2)a6 8 O-O <2 5 9 23f4 e5 10 dxe6 c6 covering b7, when White is un- able to keep his pawn on e6. Another character- istic reply is 7...c6 8 £tf4 e5 9 dxeb Re7. Another, somewhat more sneaky and very specific anti-Leningrad build-up starts with 4 c3. After 4...Jig7 5 Rb3 White prevents his op- ponent from castling and attacks b7. This varia- tion has not been deeply examined yet. Black has tried 5...<2te6 followed by 6...e6 and 5...c6 The Leningrad Variation can be said to be the natural successor of the Classical Dutch. In both variations, achieving the advance ...e5 is Black's most important plan. Around 1900, de- veloping the bishop to e7 was thought of as self-evident, but around 1950 it gradually be- came clear that fianchettoing the bishop might well be a better way of executing this classical plan. Not only does the bishop support the ad- vance ...e5 much better from g7, but the move ...e5 itself also supports the bishop, because it is very likely to result in the disappearance of White's pawn on d4, when a bishop on g7 will

b2-bishop. He can play c4 at whatever moment he sees fit. but he can also manoeuvre his knight to c4 ( ,2)bd2-c4). Black has many different ways of coping with this system, varying mainly in how fast he tries to get ...e5 in. 7...c6 is always a healthy move and 7...'S'e8 is very popular. The latter move not only supports ...e5 but has a few- other points as well. After 8 Nbd2 c6 9 Be 1 , for instance, Black could try 9...116 10 e4 fxe4 11 *£1X64 Nxe4 12 Sxe4 g5, followed by 13...Qh5, launching an attack against White's kingside in the same way as in the 3...e6 variations. The re- lationship between the Leningrad Variation and the Classical Dutch is plainly visible here.
7...Ne4 is another way of preparing ...e5:
e.g., 8 '7ibd2 Nc6 9 c4 e5, when White has to make up his mind: is it best to close the centre with 10 d5 or should he open the position with 10dxe5 Aixd2 1 1 Rxd2 dxe5? 6 ... d6
6 c4 7 -5Bc3 (D)
This is the classical approach to every 1 d4 opening. White gains space on the queenside and reinforces his hold on the centre. But in this case it is not a bad idea at all to postpone c4 or even to do without it. In fact, by playing 6 b3 d6
7 Ji.b2 (D) White is following another specific
anti-Leningrad strategy: he attempts to neutral- ize the effects of the powerful g7-bishop. This is the most important starting point of the Leningrad Variation.
7...c6 is the classical move and the provoca-
tive 7...Nc6 has also been around for a long time, but the most popular variation is 7...Re8, a move that has long been standard in the 3...e6 variations but is relatively new in the Leningrad. This is a very flexible system and it is difficult to distinguish anything resembling a clear-cut 'main variation' here. White can 'simply' de- velop his queen's knight on c3, but also on d2, where it does not obstruct the working of the
7...C6
7 ... c6 We find this little pawn move in almost all subvariations of the Leningrad. The positional
182 FUNDAMENTAL CHESS OPENINGS
advantages are evident: Black safeguards his pawn on b7 against the constant threat of the white bishop, the d8-a5 diagonal becomes avail- able to the queen and in many cases control over the d5-square turns out to be of vital im- portance. 8 d5 Throughout the years, this advance in the centre has been considered the critical reaction to 7...c6. It shows up one of the darker sides of the Leningrad Variation: the combination of pawn moves ...f5 and ...d6 has left behind a la- tent weakness at e6. It should come as no sur- prise that the standard reaction to White's d5 advance is... 8 ... e5 9 dxe6 Jtxe6 (D) concrete, tactical problems it becomes obvious that both sides have to tread carefully. For instance, 10 b3 is often played, a move which may look ordinary but which is actually an exchange sacrifice since Black has the ag- gressive reply 10...l?je4. The idea is to meet this knight sortie very prosaically with 11 <2jxe4 Jlxal 12 Qxd6 Rxd6 13 Nxd6. White is hop- ing that his initiative and the two pawns more than compensate for the exchange and most players on the black side seem to agree with this assessment, because in practice 10... a6is by far the more popular option. 10 ?d3, the alternative way of protecting c4, also involves some complicated tactics. The radical attempt to solve all strategic prob- lems by playing 10...d5 does not work because of 11 £}g5l. but 10..."52a6 1 1 Nf4£}e8 is quite playable. Black also has the ingenious little move 10...2,e8, intending to meet 1 1 Ji.14 with 1 1...6e4!, when 12 "Jxe4? fxe4 13 'fce4 i.f5 unexpectedly costs White his queen.
7...6C6
7 ... 4Ac6 (D) This position is critical for an evaluation of
7...c6. It also illustrates the pros and cons of
...f5 very nicely. On the one hand, the open a2- g8 diagonal makes Black's position somewhat vulnerable, while on the other hand having a pawn on f5 gives Black a firm grip on e4. It is difficult for White to play e4 and perhaps Black will be able to manoeuvre a knight to this vital square. A second important factor in the diagrammed position is the pawn on d6. Will White be able to force his opponent on the defensive by turn- ing this pawn into a target or will Black develop active piece-play and perhaps even be able to play ...d5? In a strategic sense this is a fairly uncompli- cated type of position, but if we look at the Black is making it plain that he intends to play 8...e5. He also emphatically challenges White to thwart this plan by replying 8 d5. The whole idea looks rather foolish at first sight, because we have just seen that, in general, d5 is an attractive move in any case. Nevertheless, Black has two different ways of trying to justify
7... 3c6. In both cases, play is likely to become
DUTCH DEFENCE 183
much more complicated than in the 7...c6 varia- tion. 8 d5
8...Na5 is the more solid of the two options
at Black's disposal. If White covers his c-pawn with 9 Nd2, Black plays 9...c5 (D). warding off the threat of 10 b4 and bringing about the typi- cal middlegame structure that is best known from the Panno Variation of the King's Indian Defence (see page 117). consequences of which have not been cleared up despite decades of research and practical evidence. The idea is to meet 11 gxf4 with 1 1...2>h5! 12 fxe5 Jtxe5 13 <Ne2 Rd6. when the prospect of an attack against White's king and control over the dark squares on the king- side are very real. The critical test is probably 14 f4, returning the pawn. In the resulting sim- plified position. White may hope to have re- tained some initiative. The difference is that in the Dutch Defence Black has (obviously) already played ...f5. The opening battle will revolve around this small, but strategically important factor. Which side will be able to take advantage of it? Just by way of an example: after 10 Rc2 e5 there are two differences in the evaluation of 11 dxe6, that make this exchange more logical here than in the analogous situation in the King's Indian, In the first place Black will not be able to recap- ture on e6 with his f-pawn, which he would like to do on principle. Secondly, not taking on e6 is not really an option here as having a pawn on f5 will then be a bonus for Black, something he will have got for free and which he would have had to work for in every' comparable King's In- dian variation. If 8...Na5 requires some subtle strategic thinking, the alternative 8...Ne5 9 Nxe5 dxe5 (D) leads to a position where one's prospects will depend almost entirely on one's ability to calculate concrete variations. If 10 e4, for instance, Black has the surpris- ing rejoinder 10..,f4!?, a pawn sacrifice the

[diagram]
8 ... a6 (D) Black calmly continues his development without committing himself immediately to any particular pawn-formation. He will play ...c6, ...c5 or ...e5, depending on White's furtherplay. for ...e5. Tournament practice also showed that it is remarkably difficult for White to avoid get- ting involved in an all-out battle, the outcome of which is totally unclear in most cases, mak- ing this an ideal variation to 'play for a win' with the black pieces. This uncompromising character is perfectly in line with the general spirit of l...f5. It is not a coincidence then, that this variation has quickly become one of the main lines of the modern Dutch Defence. 8 d5 This advance comes equally naturally here as it did after 7...c6 and 7...Qc6. But in this case there are a number of major alternatives, all of which aim to prevent or discourage ...e5. To begin with. 8 2el is an interesting little move. White intends to meet 8...e5 with 9 dxe5 dxe5 10 e4, when the presence of an enemy rook on the same file suddenly makes the black queen feel rather awkward on e8 (a subtle but vitally important difference from the position after 8 Rc2 e5 9 dxe5 dxe5 10 e4, where Black can just continue 10...41c6 without any prob- lems). On closer inspection, however, it tran- spires that Black can turn the situation around with the sly 8...Qf7. If White now protects his pawn on c4 with the natural move 9 b3. Black will play 9...Ne4, to which White finds himself unable to respond with 10 -53xe4 fxe4 11 £3g5, because all of a sudden f2 has come under at- tack. A very different, but no less interesting idea is to play 8 Nd5. White is hoping that after
8...Nxd5 9 cxd5 his doubled pawns will cramp
the enemy position sufficiently to prevent him from becoming aggressive. And it is true that the straightforward 9...e5 10 dxe6 jLxe6 11 ?Jg5 now looks very good for White. But White's rigid pawn-formation has its weak spots as well. To begin with there is the ingenious 9...'sft>5. attacking d5. while the modest 9...c6 also seems perfectly reasonable.
8 b3 is also quite popular. White does not
prevent 8...e5, but he prepares to attack Black's central formation immediately by means of 9 dxe5 dxe5 1 0 e4. Tactically this is justified by
10...fxe4 11 Nxe4 Nxe4 12 'S'd5+, winning
back the piece. If. however, Black calmly re- sponds by developing with 10...Nc6. a fierce In the early days of the 7...Rc8 variation. 9 Nd4 was the main line, intending to take the initiative with a quick e4. However, logical though this plan is, Black's position turned out to be well equipped to deal with it. After
9...Bd7 10 e4 fxe4 11 €jxc4 Nxe4 12 .a.xe4
and now, for instance. 12...c6, followed by 1 3...'$)c7. chances are about equal. The discovery that a plan based on e4 did not automatically yield a superior position was in fact the first indication that 7...Re8 is a really solid line. Suddenly it became clear that it is not at all easy to find a good plan for White. After several years of confusion, a plan in- volving a queenside attack finally proved to be White's best chance. This led to 9 Shi becom- ing the most popular move and to the type of po- sition arising after 9...c6 10 dxc6 bxc6 1 1 b4 becoming critical for the evaluation of the entire
7...'fi;e8 system. The result of this plan is a heavy
battle between Black's central pawn-mass and White's queenside majority. White's chances are based mainly on the advance b5. often in con- nection with the knight manoeuvre Q\14-c6. Both sides need a healthy dose of vigorous- ness here and preferably they should be abso- lutely convinced of being in the right. Other 1 d4 Openings
1 d4 (D) Black on his first move, but these have as yet
caused considerably less theoretical turmoil and 1 shall treat them only very briefly here: l...c5 is really a primeval form of Benoni. that has long been superseded by the modem move-order 1 d4 4Bf6 2 c4 c5. Black could try to prove that some of the well-known Benoni plans are equally playable without ...Nf6; e.g., I d4 c5 2 d5 e5 (D). Having looked at l...d5, 1...5)f6 and l...f5, we now have a clear picture of Black's most popular and most important replies to 1 d4. These are the moves on which the vast majority of 1 d4 theory is based. They are also the three moves that take up the fight for central domi- nance right from the start. All of them prevent White from playing 2 e4. Depending on his opening repertoire against 1 e4, Black could also follow a different strat- egy. By playing either l...e6. 1...d6 or l...g6. he offers his opponent a chance of 'correcting' his first move, for if White responds with 2 e4, the players find themselves in 1 e4 territory after all. In that case 1 d4 theory has nothing to say but goodbye (except in the case of L...g6 2 e4 Ji.g7 3 c4). Not every 1 d4 player will be happy to do this though, some because they do not know any 1 e4 theory, others because they think there are better moves than 2 e4. Whatever the reason, by not playing 2 e4 White steers the game into new territory and this has resulted in three independent 1 d4 openings. In this chapter we shall take a closer look at these three openings, which are all of fairly re- cent origin. There are a few other options for However, this idea has never really caught on.
1...5)c6 is a highly provocative move, analo-
gous to 1 d4 Nf6 2 c4 $jc6. On the one hand Black allows a transposition to the Nimzo- witsch Defence by 2 e4 (see page 461), on the other he challenges his opponent to play 2 d5. And as if these possibilities are not confusing enough, both players also have to consider the consequences of 2 c4, when 2...e5 is the in- tended reaction. With an opening move like this, Black is really stretching his resources to the limit as well as those of opening theory and (perhaps) those of his opponent. 2 £}f3 is a frus- tratingly solid reply, when Black must either re- turn to civilized theory (2...d5) or stick out his neck even further; e.g., with the risky 2...d6 3 d5 Ne5 4 <Nxe5 dxe5.
186 FUNDAMENTAL CHESS OPENINGS
1...b5 is taking this provocative attitude one
step further. This is the Polish Defence. Instead of stopping the opponent from playing 2 e4. Black prevents 2 c4. Paradoxically, this leads to a 1 e4 opening that does not exist against 1 e4! For, unless White prefers to be ultra-cautious, he will play 2 e4, which creates a true 1 e4 type of position, albeit one that cannot be reached via 1 e4 (assuming that after 1 e4 b5? White does not overlook his chance of winning a pawn by 2 jLxb5). Strangely enough, this open- ing does have a name, but hardly any fans and not a good reputation either. After 2...Jlb7 White can play 3 f3, but 3 Nd2 and 3 Ad3 are equally strong. In any case, by playing 1 ...b5 Black appears to have imposed a slightf?) hand- icap upon himself.
1...b6 is a more cautious, but also a more
passive move than l...b5. Here too 2 e4 is both the most straightforward and the strongest re- ply, which in this case does indeed land us into
1 e4 theory.
I...e6 1 ... c6(D) move is that Black 'threatens' to transpose to other 1 d4 openings, so the more of these open- ings a player has available to him, the more he can take advantage of this transpositional as- pect of l...e6. 2 c4 For those who have no wish to venture 2 e4. this move is the most important possibility, but even those whose repertoire does include 2 e4 may find 2 c4 an interesting option. In fact, try- ing to say which of these two moves is objec- tively better is as impossible as saying 1 d4 is better than 1 e4 or vice versa. A third option is the neutral move 2 4Jf3. White avoids the two lines that make 1 d4 e6 2 c4 an independent opening, for 2..Bb4+ makes little sense when White's c-pawn is still on c2 and 2...b6 3 e4 does not offer Black the same powerful counterplay as does 2 c4 b6 (it will more closely resemble l...b6). To make a choice between 2 c4 and 2 4tlf3 White needs to consider whether 2...<15, 2...Qf6 and 2..T5 transpose to the 'right' variations for him and whether he does not mind 2 Nf3 c5. Since the standard Benoni reply 3 d5 is not particularly attractive in this case. 2...c5 is an important move, but it can only be played by those who are prepared to defend the black side of a Sicilian, which arises - perhaps surprisingly - after 3 e4. We now return to 2 c4 (D): Any player who is not afraid of a transposi- tion to the French Defence by 2 e4, will find that this is an interesting and flexible reply to 1 d4. It has attracted players renowned for their bold and imaginative play in the past, like Paul Keres and Jonathan Speelman. Playing l...e6 requir es a certain knowledge of a few other 1 d4 openings, for one of the strong points of this After 2 c4 Black has three transpositional possibilities. 2...d5 is a Queen's Gambit De- clined. 2...'2ff6 is the Nimzo/Queen's/Bogo- Indian complex and 2...f5 is a Dutch Defence.
OTHER 1 d4 OPENINGS 187
3 ... aS (D) Unlike the analogous variation of the Bogo- Indian Defence, this move has become the main line here, but the alternatives 3... _xd2+ and
3...'Qe7 are equally playable. An original inter-
pretation of 3...Jlxd2+ was suggested by Tony Miles, when he played 4 Qxd2 b6 5 Nc3 jLb7 6 e4 A',h6 several times during the early 1990s. Black plans to attack the enemy centre pawns with ...f5. The strategic idea of the Dutch De- fence is in fact turned around here. Instead of playing ...f5 to prevent e4, Black even invites his opponent to play e4 and only then, when it is really powerful, does he play ...f5. As we shall see below, this idea is closely related to the English Defence. Of these, only the last, 2,..f5, gives Black's move-order some practical importance. Many devotees of the Dutch use l...e6 as their first move in order to restrict White's options. After
1 d4 e6 2 c4 f5 White is committed to a varia-
tion with c4. But 1 ...e6 gets its independent significance from two other moves: 2...Bb4+ and 2...b6, the English Defence. I...e6 2 c4 ±b4 + 2 ... ±b4+ (Di This variation is a close relative of the Bogo- Indian Defence. But what may look like a mi- croscopic difference only (the moves <2Af3 and ...f f6 have not yet been played) makes the po- sition much more dynamic. In several varia- tions Black allows his opponent to play e4 and immediately starts an attack against White's centre pawns. 3 .d2 Probably White's most natural way of reliev- ing the check. In case of 3 42}d2, the differences from the Bogo-Indian Defence are rather smaller. Both
3...c5 and 3...d5 often cause a transposition to
the Bogo; e.g.. 3...d5 4 Ra4+ Qc6 5 £jf3 Nf6.
3...f5 would be the main alternative, giving the
game a decidedly Dutch flavour without di- rectly transposing. If 3 5)03 White allows a transposition to the Nimzo-Indian Defence (3...Nf6). Here too,
3...f5 must be considered the main alternative.
Is this not a strange opening? Black does not even seem to notice that the board has a centre, let alone that he should be trying to oc- cupy it. That it is taken very seriously indeed, how- ever. is amply proven by the fact that few play- ers take 'advantage' of the opportunity to play 4 e4. even when there is not really any concrete reason why this move should not be good. Black may react in a self-controlled way with
4...d6, followed by ...e5. or he may lash out by
4...d5, with 5 cxd5 exd5 6 e5 <2)e7 the most
likely continuation. 4 4bf3 is the more popular choice, inviting Black to transpose to the Bogo-Indian proper with 4,..?}f6. Black has several alternatives, of which 4...d6 5 g3 <2k6 6 J&g2 e5 is the most im- portant.

Black is stretching the laws of classical open- ing play to the very limit. He allows his oppo- nent to form a pawn-centre from e4 to c4 in order to attack this formation with truly breath- taking ferocity. This is a strategy that demands total commitment, an open mind and an un- usual capacity for independent thinking. Most of all, it requires the mentality of the uncom- promising fighter. No quarter asked, no quarter given. The English Defence first became popular in Great Britain during the 1970s. Since then, games by Grandmasters Speelman, Miles and Short and many others have brought its dy- namic possibilities to the attention of the inter- national chess world. 3 e4 This principled move constitutes the natural main line of this opening, but the cautious 3 a3 is also taken very seriously by both players and theoreticians. White eliminates the possibility of ...Bb4 and prepares to meet 3...Bb7 with 4 Nc3. He should not be averse to playing the 4 a3 variation of the Queen's Indian Defence, be- cause if Black replies 4... )f6 there does not seem to be anything better than 5 <2Bf3 with a direct transposition. Instead of 4,..Nf6, many prefer the sharper 4...f5, giving the game a Dutch flavour.

also not bad. but since both these lines offer Now what is it that makes this position more attractive for Black than the one after 1 ...b6 2 e4 -S.b7. which I treated so briefly (and perhaps a trifle disparagingly) in the introduction to this chapter? The difference is the extra move c4. With pawns on e4 and d4 only, it is very hard for Black to make any real impact with his counter- attack, but with a pawn on c4 White lacks the possibility of strengthening d4 with c3. White has also had to invest an extra tempo so that he is a developing move behind on the 1...b6 line. Nevertheless the move c4 is intrinsically sound. It will only serve to make White's cen- tral position even stronger in the long run. that is r/White is given the time to consolidate his position. Thus it is really 'time' which is the key factor in this opening, which explains why its variations are so very highly charged with dynamics. To begin with, it is not at all clear how White should protect e4. A first impression of what White is in for may be formed by looking at 4 Rc2. Black can then afford to intensify the attack against e4 with a move which in practically every other

opening is completely out of the question: the extremely aggressive 4...Rh4. If then 5 'Sic3 or 5 £hd2 Black continues 5...Jlb4 6 Bd3 f5. The outcome of this early charge may be unclear, but White certainly has to be very careful if his centre pawns are not to be reduced to a row of targets. 4 l.d3 (D) is equally double-edged. into a pawn sacrifice and after 6...4)f6. fol- lowed if possible by castling kingside, he will be the one who has the initiative and it will be White who will have to cope with an attack against his king. It is remarkable and characteristic for the flexibility of the English Defence that Black also has a solid (but not passive!) alternative, namely 4...$)c6 (D). The reason is that it allows the characteristic counter 4...f5!?, At first this was played with the idea of simply taking on g2, should White play 5 exf5. but this was soon found to be too dangerous. After 5...jtxg2 6 Rh5+ Black is forced to play 6...g6 7 fxg6 Bg7 (7...£jf6? loses to 8 g7+!) 8 gxh7+ 'i'fS. The loss of some mate- rial is now unavoidable for White, but Black's king is in great danger. After the rook sacrifice
9 Qe2 .iLxhl 10 .g5 11 Rh4 (threatening
12 <5)f4) had been successful for White a num- ber of times around 1980, this variation was largely abandoned and a search for a new de- fence to 4 Bd3 began. The first discovery was that there is an alter- native interpretation of 4..T5: after 5 exf5 Black has the sneaky zwischenzug 5...jLb4+, If White then simply plays 6 Nc3. taking on g2 becomes much more attractive, because Black now has
6...Bxg2 7 Rh5+ Nf8!, when all of a sudden
the imminent loss of a rook becomes a very du- bious investment for White. This means that White is in fact forced to meet 5..Jlb4+ with 6 *fl (D). But this changes the character of the position completely. Black now turns his opening plan Now it is the pawn on d4 that needs to be defended, but both 5 £rf3 and 5 2e2 allow
5...Nb4, when White has to give up the bishop-
pair. Of course he will have some compensation in the shape of a lead in development and a cen- tral pawn-formation which is now really strong, but this too is an interesting and lively position which contains chances for both sides. Even 4 f3 is less safe than it looks, and again this is because of the typical counter-thrust ...f5. Back in 1979, Tony Miles introduced the

At the time this idea caused a sensation, but now it is a standard device, known to every 2...b6 player. After 6 fxe6 Black calmly continues 6...sbf5 (D). I...d6 1 ... d6 (D) 140 141 m an White has two extra pawns, but the holes in his position seem to increase in size with every move and Black's lead in development is be- coming very menacing indeed (the immediate threat is 7...Rh4+). Finally, there is the sound developing move 4 $Jc3, but this only postpones the problem un- til after 4...jS.b4 ID). In a strategic sense, l...d6 is very different from 1...e6. Black introduces the possibility of playing ...e5. rather like the Old Indian De- fence. Yet there are some remarkable similari- ties between the two moves. In the first place Black has to be prepared for 2 e4. which in this case transposes to a Pirc Defence. Secondly, it is very hard to say whether 2 e4 is actually the best move and. finally, the main alternatives are the same: if White is not sure about 2 e4 he will want to consider 2 c4 and 2 3jf3. I...d6 2 c4 2 c4 This is perhaps the move that comes most naturally to a 1 d4 player. Black now has 2...Nf6, transposing to the Old Indian proper, and 2...f5. transposing to the Dutch Defence.

This too does not imply that Black has al- ready won the opening battle, but it certainly does test the opponent's nerves. Not every player likes to be facing an enemy pawn on c4 as White so early in the game. I...d6 2 Now the two ways of resolving the tension 2 Qf3 (D) immediately, 3 d5 and 3 dxe5 dxe5 4 Qxd8+ Qxd8 (just as in the corresponding situation in the Old Indian, after I d4 <2)f6 2 c4 d6 3 c3 e5), are not really bad, but definitely not overly attractive either. White would much rather main- tain the tension with either 3 3c3 or 3 <?3f3. But unfortunately he cannot play both moves, so he has to choose between them and it so happens that they both have a specific drawback. It is on these two drawbacks that the variation 2...e5 is based. 3 '$Jc3 is met by 3...exd4. This immediate capture forces White to take back on d4 with the queen (4 Rxd4), when Black has 4...Nc6 with gain of tempo. Although this does not mean that Black's opening problems are auto- matically solved, it must be regarded as a con- cession by White, if only a minor one. This brings us to the alternative 3 Q)f3, cover- ing d4 but provoking 3...e4. an advance which is now relatively more attractive than in the com- parable situation in the Old Indian Defence (1 d4 2 c4 d6 3 4)c3 e5 4 £rf3), because after
3...e4 4 43g5 Black has the option of providing
solid support for his e-pawn by playing 4...f5
<D).
When studying the consequences of 2 c4 e5, it is only natural to start wondering: is it not far simpler to prevent 2...e5 altogether? Admittedly, by playing 2 Nf3 White makes the (minimal) concession of committing himself to a <2)f3 vari- ation in the Old Indian (2...'71f6 3 c4), the Mod- em (2...g6) and the Dutch Defence (2...f5), but, if that is the whole extent of the problem, does not 2 1<Jf3 make life a lot easier for White? Unfortunately, life is never easy in the world of opening theory. Even a neutral move such
192 FUNDAMENTAL CHESS OPENINGS
as 2 ftf3 gives Black a target for a counterat- tack. 2 ... Ng4 (D) If the typical French pawn-formation of white pawns on e5 and d4 against black pawns on d5 and e6 arises, Black will have solved the one big problem of that opening in advance: the de- velopment of his light-squared bishop. This means that White will have to think of some- thing better than 5 Jle2 d5 6 e5. or a similar routine reaction. But what? That is not an easy question. There are three directions in which White has been looking for an answer. In the first place. White may radically pre- vent ...d5 by putting a pawn on d5 himself: 5 dS. Secondly, he could consider allowing ...d5 and then try to lake advantage of the loss of time entailed in Black playing ...d6-d5 rather than ...d5, for instance by playing 5 jLe2 d5 6 exd5 or 5...i.e7 6 O-O O-O 7 Ne3 d5 8 exd5. Thirdly, White can try' to take the initiative right from the start. It is mainly the sharp reac- tion 5 h3 Jlh5 6 Qe2 (anticipating a future ...Bg6 and creating the possible threat of Q'b5+)
6...c6 7 g4 jiLs6 8 h4 that has come to be seen as
the critical test of the entire 2..Jfc.g4 system. White is threatening to trap the bishop with 9 h5. A plausible continuation is 8...h5 9 g5 Nfd7. White has considerably more space, but Black's position is solid and still very' flexible.

Most 1 d4 players will feel more at home with this move than with 3 e4. Nevertheless, if move met with initial scepticism but gained wide acceptance once people got used to it. In fact, I ...d6 owes its current popularity mainly to 2...Bg4, which raises problems of a rather unusual and positional nature. The most important variations are 3 e4 and 3 c4. Other moves, like 3 e3 or 3 &bd2, for in- stance, to prevent a possible doubling of pawns by ...Jslxf3, are unnecessarily timid.

He is aiming to create a pawn-structure that is typical of the French De- fence (1 e4 e6 2 d4 d5), but with one small yet extremely important positional improvement: the bishop from c8 has been developed 'through' the impassable barrier which is formed by Black's own pawn-chain in the French Defence proper.
OTHER 1 (14 OPENINGS 193
Black now plays 3....Nxf3, a very unusual posi- tion arises, for which 'regular' 1 d4 openings offer little or no guidelines. If White recaptures with his g-pawn (4 gxf3), he will have a large but somewhat unwieldy mass of central pawns. Black's position is much more flexible. It is hard to say which side has the better chances here, but not everyone will feel comfortable in this kind of double-edged situation. The alternative 4 exf3 keeps a tighter rein on things. White is hoping to utilize the open e-file to put pressure on the enemy position and to give the opponent no targets, but Black's posi- tion remains solid. If Black played 2...jLg4 more in order to un- nerve the opponent than actually to take on f3, he may want to return to a regular Old Indian Defence with 3...Nf6, but another option is to play 3...Nd7. The prospect of being able to meet 4 e4 e5 5 Ne2 with 5...Ne7 6 tie 3 ±xf3 7 J_xf3 Bg5 may be tempting to a player who likes to think in positional terms. Black loses quite a few tempi, but if he succeeds in keeping the centre closed he may well profit from these exchanges in the long run. I...g6
1 g6 (D)
Surely this is the most casual reaction to I d4 that one can possibly think of. It could in fact be called the ultimate non-reaction. Black does not lift a finger to prevent his opponent from form- ing a broad pawn-centre or from developing his pieces in whatever way he likes. Nor does Black make a secret of what his next move is going to be. With the possible exception of 2 Ah6, any second move by White will be met by
2...Ng7. But can Black really afford such a
laid-back attitude? For a very' long time the official answer to this question was a loud and clear 'no'. In a book by Carl Jaenisch from 1843, 1...g6 gets a place in the chapter on 'Various incorrect open- ings'. Nearly a century later Alexander Ale- khine repeatedly condemned 1 ...g6 in his game commentaries. It was not until the mid-20th century that the tide began to turn. The rise to fame of the King's Indian Defence stimulated interest and a renewed appraisal of related openings such as the Pirc Defence and l...g6. When during the 1960s great champions like Tigran Petro- sian. Mikhail Botvinnik and Vasily Smyslov experimented with l...g6, the result was a breakthrough. Finally 1 ...g6 had become a fully respectable opening. It has been given several names, of which the Modern Defence is the most widely used. But whatever its name, the opening l...g6 firmly stands nowadays, sup- ported by the same strategic pillars that carry the weight of the King's Indian and the Pirc Defence. Black's position is elastic, offering a large number of possible ways in which to attack White's central position. A practical advantage of L..g6 is that it can be played against both 1 e4 and I d4. In fact it cannot even be said to be- long to cither 1 e4 or 1 d4 theory; it is part of both!
194 FUNDAMENTAL CHESS OPENINGS
In an attempt to do justice to this aspect of universality of l...g6, 1 shall split this opening into two parts. All the typical 1 e4 variations (i.e. those lines where White plays e4, but not c4) will be dealt with in the section on 1 e4 g6 in the last chapter of this book. All variations where White does play c4 (either in combina- tion with e4 or not) will be discussed below. 2 c4 As is the case after l...e6 and l...d6, the choice between 2 c4 and 2 e4 is largely a matter of taste. One could say though, that by playing
2 e4 White retains the greater number of options.
After all, 2 c4, the characteristic 1 d4 approach, does allow Black an immediate transposition to a 'major' opening, namely the King's Indian Defence. It is true that after 2 e4 White could also allow a transposition - in this case to the Pirc Defence, for instance via 2...Bg7 3 (2)c3 d6 followed by 4...Nf6 - but this is not forced and White may well choose a set-up with c3 in- stead, to avoid a Pirc. He could also change tack and go for the 1 d4 solution after all, by playing
2 e4 £ g 7 3 c4.
2 ... ± g 7 (D) If Black wants to be sure of a King's Indian he could play 2...TT6 right away, although in that case there does not seem to be any point in having opened l...g6. In any case, 2...Ag7 is the more flexible move. This principled move constitutes the main line, but there may be good reasons why a player might prefer a slightly more cautious ap- proach, like 3 Nc3 or 3 £sf3. In the first place Black has a few interesting moves against 3 e4, that White may well wish to avoid. Secondly, some players may want to play the g3 system against a King's Indian De- fence and in that case the logical move would be 3 '<Jf3. Apart from an actual transposition to the King's Indian with 3...?3f6, Black then has
3...fS. transposing to the Dutch, and 3...c5. pro-
voking a transposition to the Benoni (4 d5) or to the Sicilian Defence (which may come as a sur- prise to some) by 4 e4 cxd4 5 £}xd4. If Black wants to steer clear of all these 'other' openings, 3...d6 4 g3 '?3d7 5 -4,g2 e5 6 <2}c3 and now. for instance, 6...<Ne7 is a solid option. Black also has a few independent options against the alternative 3 <?3c3, the most impor- tant one being 3...c5. This is quite an awkward move for White, because 4 d5 does not neces- sarily result in the desired transposition to the Benoni now that Black can reply 4...Axc3+ 5 bxc3 f5 (D). This hypermodern variation, which combines elements from the Nimzo-Indian Defence (the exchange on c3) and the Dutch (the prevention of e4 by ...f5), has not yet been wholly assimi- lated by opening theory and, perhaps because of this, many players do not feel comfortable with it. Unfortunately for White, the alternative 4 3 is also problematic, because this leads to White now faces a major decision. He has to take several transpositions to other openings into account. 3 e4

Especially after 5 d5 tensions may run high. A critical position is reached after 5...Nd4 6 Be3 c5 7 S)ge2. If Black now simply takes on e2, his knight manoeuvre has not brought him any great benefits. After 7... xe2 8 Axe2 we have a Benoni pawn-structure in a relatively fa- vourable version for White because his pieces are better developed than Black's. But the real point of the 4...Nc6 line is the much more am- This is the most important starting position bitious move 7...Qb6 (D). of this opening. The crucial question is: does Black have anything better than a transposition to the King's Indian Defence with 4...Qf6 (or at least something which is equally playable)? The main attempts to answer this question in the affirmative are 4...Nc6 and 4...e5. two moves that immediately attack d4, exploiting the fact that without a knight on f6, the diagonal of Black's g7-bishop is still open. A third option is to prepare ...e5 by playing

early years of l...g6. but nowadays such prepa- ration is considered superfluous.

This move poses a very concrete problem. Should While let himself be provoked into playing 5 d5 or is it more sensible to protect d4, and if so, how should he do this? Theory does not offer a clear answer to these questions but it does provide some lively and original varia- tions. Black keeps his knight on d4 as long as pos- sible, while attacking b2. Against the obvious reply 8 Rd2 he has 8...?Bf6 9 £txd4 cxd4, with the idea of meeting 10 Ji.xd4 very powerfully with 10...'2)xe4!, while after 10 Qxd4, he main- tains the material balance by 10...Rxb2. The immediate 8 5jxd4 cxd4 9 Na4 is considered more dangerous for Black, especially if, after
9...Ra5+ 10 Bd2 Rc7, White sacrifices a pawn
with 11 c5. The idea is that 1 1 ...dxc5 12 Ab5+

disorganizes Black's position, while giving White a substantial lead in development. Yet even this sharp reaction has not been able to re- fute 4...'2}c6. Black's most solid defence seems to be 1 l...Nf6. 8 Ra5+ 9 Nd2 is a more cautious approach by White. IfWhitehas no wish to enter these complica- tions, he has two obvious alternatives: 5 jice3 and 5 4~;ge2. A third option. 5 Nf3, is less plau- sible because it gives Black an easy way of in- tensifying the pressure against d4 with 5..Jlg4. Against 5 Jle3 the main line is 5...e5 6 d5 and now 6...Qce7 instead of the perhaps more obvi- ous 6... 2Bd4. This is because after 6...<2)d4 7 Nge2 Black is unable to maintain his knight on d4, with 7...Nxe2 8 Bxe2 and 7...c5 8 dxc6 as two rather unattractive prospects. After 6...Qce7 (D) the position resembles a King's Indian De- fence, while containing a few original extra op- tions for both sides. I...g6 2 c4 Ag7 3 e4 d6 4 c3 e5 4 ... eS (D) We have seen how important this central ad- vance is in the 4...*5Ac6 variation. White now faces the same strategic problem that confronts him in the King's Indian Defence. How should he react to this attack against the heart of his pawn-formation? In principle this is always a choice between playing d5 and dxe5. but the really important question is: when? What is the best moment for either of these options? 5 ftf3 This neutral developing move postpones the decision. Whether this is best is uncertain. The immediate relieving of the tension, either way, also has its supporters. If White is thinking of exchanging on e5, any further delay is unwise. Only by playing 5 dxe5 immediately can he seriously hope that this approach will work. Alter 5...dxe5 6 Qxd8+ Sxd8 White will open the position further with 7 f4. He will then try to take advantage of the position of Black's king, for whom there is no easy escape-route (like castling) from the on- coming struggle in the centre. This variation may lead to a lively confrontation between two fundamentally different styles of play: White's initiative against Biack's long-term prospects In case of a 'normal' move like 7 Qd2. Black can lash out on the kingside immediately with
7...f5, an advance he usually has to work a bit
harder for in a regular King's Indian. On the other hand. White has the option of playing 7 g4, anticipating ...f5. He also has 7 c5. which in principle is always a sound plan in the King's Indian but often difficult to achieve. Similar problems arise after 5 5)ge2 e5. Against 6 d5 Black again plays 6...?3ce7, while against 6 Jce3 (a position that may also result from 5 -Nc3. if White continues 5...e5 6 Qge2) Black has some rather aggressive options in
6...f5 and 6... h6 7 f3 f5. Another possibility

Just as in the King's Indian Defence, Black should never just take on d4 at random. In this position he has a definite plan in mind. 7 xe3 2>ge7 (D) of controlling d4. Who will make the most of his chances? The immediate 5 d5 is also not bad. but it does give Black complete freedom to adapt his piece development as well as he can to this par- ticular pawn-formation. The bold 5...f5 6 exf5 gxf5 is a critical variation. Perhaps somewhat surprisingly. Black invites his opponent to play 7 Rh5+. He is counting on the solidity of his posi- tion after 7...Qf8 and believes that gaining a tempo by playing 8..Aif'6 will provide sufficient compensation for the loss of the right to castle. 5 ... exd4 This is the crucial test of 5 Nf3. If White re- fuses to choose between dxe5 and d5, it is only logical that Black will try to 'punish' him by taking on d4.
5...jLg4, 5...Nc6 and 5...Nd7 are the alter-
natives. Against 5...Jlg4 the usual reply is 6 d5. After 5...<2)c6 White can also play 6 d5, but another possibility is to make good use of the fact that he has played ?Jf3 and throw in 6 Xg5 (D). just to annoy Black. This is one of the most critical positions of the entire Modem Defence. Black develops his king's knight on e7 in or- der to use his f-pawn as a battering-ram against White's central position. After 8 Jle2 O-O 9 O-O he will play 9...f5, threatening 10...f4 and forc- ing his opponent to play with great precision. The obvious solution 10 exf5, for instance, meets with the treacherous reply 10,..Jlxd4! 1 1 jLxd4 Nxf5, when White is reduced to playing the rather miserable 12 ,Ne3 Nxe3 13 fxe3. leaving him with a deplorable isolated little pawn on e3. 10 W'd2 is a better move, which is usually met by 10...fxe4 1 1 Nxe4 ?3f5. An- other option is to play 10 ?jxc6. Most players then prefer 10...bxc6 to 10... xc6. Although the latter move is certainly not bad, doubling the c-pawns strengthens Black's control over some important central squares and makes his position more dynamic. A possible drawback of the development of the knight to e7 (as opposed to ...Nf6) is that it leaves Black's kingside vulnerable to a flank attack: 8 h4. Nevertheless, Black has done pretty well in practice with moves like 8...f5 and 8...h5.
B
If 6...1'6, White drops his bishop back to e3 and has his pawn on d4 firmly protected. Finally, S.-.'Sld? is a solid move but not ex- actly difficult to handle for White. After 6 jLe2 4igf6 7 O-O O-O we are in a variation of the King's Indian Defence (see page 105). 6...Ne7 would be a way of avoiding such transpositions. Flank Openings Now wc shall look at the flank openings, of which 1 c4 and 1 <2)f3 are the most important. These opening moves betray a rather more moderate attitude. While not as yet physically occupying any central squares. White does start taking control over them. White prepares for a fight in the centre but he does not want to be the one to take the first step.
1 c4 has been called the English Opening
ever since Howard Staunton (1810-74), one of the strongest players in the world in the mid- 19th century, played this opening move in a time when 1 e4 was still regarded as practically a matter of course. But it was not widely ac- cepted as a serious opening until around 1920. a time when many obsolete theories and dogmas were looked at in a new light and often cast aside as a result. Around the same time, 1 Nf3 came to the fore as being the natural counterpart of 1 c4. One of the pioneers of this revolutionary new approach to openings in general (called Hyper- modern at the time) was Richard Reti (1889- 1929), after whom 1 £rf3 was eventually named. It is mainly thanks to his efforts that the new phenomenon of a flank opening, as a fully legit- imate alternative to the classical opening moves
1 d4 and 1 e4, was brought to the attention of
both the general public and the world's elite of top players. In fact. 1 c4 and 1 #)f3 are so closely related that they could well be regarded as a single opening system. They are both based on the same principles and many variations may arise equally well from either move. This has re- sulted in this section of opening theory literally abounding in transpositional possibilities, not just between 1 c4 and 1 <2)f3. but involving 1 d4 and even (though to a lesser extent) 1 e4 open- ings as well. Especially the type of position where both players move their c-pawn forward is a veritable melting pot. This system, the larg- est in the entire complex of flank openings, is reached via 1 c4 c5 or via 1 '2)f3 f6 2 c4 c5. It is called the Symmetrical English and we shall start our journey through the flank openings from there. There is. however, one major difference be- tween 1 c4 and 1 Nf3. By playing 1 c4 White allows his opponent to play l...e5, a move which gives rise to a Sicilian (1 e4 c5) position with colours reversed. Because the Sicilian is both Black's most popular and his most contro- versial defence to 1 e4, it stands to reason that the reversed version is equally conducive to markedly diverging opinions. Some players have great trust in White's position after 1 c4 e5, some have equally great faith in Black's chances, while many do not know what to think of it and do not like it with either colour. This opening is often called the Reversed Sicilian. 1 4)f3 prevents 1 ...e5. It also allows White, if he so chooses, to bail out of the flank openings after l...d5, by playing 2 d4. Naturally, real flank strategy offers a totally different perspec- tive on l...d5. As was first shown by Reti, White can either attack the pawn straightaway with 2 c4 or he can delay a frontal attack until he has further strengthened his control over im- portant central squares with 2 g3 or 2 b3. Finally, there are moves like 1 g3. 1 b3, 1 1'4 and 1 <22sc3 to consider. By choosing one of these openings. White distances himself from the heavy traffic on the highways that have been built by opening theoreticians. In all of these openings White (and Black for that mat- ter) is doing a balancing act between opening theory (meaning the whole body of known and accepted theoretical variations) and pure im- provisation. Symmetrical English
1 c4 c5 (D)
The Symmetrical English occupies a central place in the area of the flank openings, not only because the symmetrical l...c5 is as logical and sound a reply to 1 c4as l...d5 to 1 d4and l...e5 to 1 e4, but also because the same applies for 1 4t)f3. Against that opening move too the sym- metrical reply 1 ...£jf6 is one of the most critical and the symmetry even continues here, because against 2 c4 (White's most popular continua- tion) the symmetrical reply 2...c5 is again of crucial importance. The Symmetrical English is really what binds the opening moves 1 c4 and 1 <2)1'3 together. line from the time of origin (say the 1930s) un- til around 1980. The second option is to do exactly the oppo- site: open the centre by playing d4. This plan is logically introduced by 2 <2)f3, when White is ready to play 3 d4. But he is not committed! He could also continue 3 Nc3, perhaps even 4 g3, before lashing out in the centre. He will choose the moment which he considers the most favourable for himself and this will largely depend on Black's opening play. This is the modern interpretation of the Symmetri- cal English.
2 Nc3
2 4jc3 (D) By responding in a symmetrical way Black is really saying to his opponent "The ball is in your court again''. By opening 1 c4. White has decided not to occupy the centre immediately. Black does the same. What now? Fundamentally, there are two options. The first is to carry on with a consistent flank strategy: increase control over the central square d5 before undertaking any kind of positive ac- tion in the centre. The standard method of im- plementing this plan is 2 4bc3, followed by 3 g3 and 4 Jtg2. This is the classical way of playing the Symmetrical English and it was the main Now it is Black's turn to face the fundamen- tal decision between a plan with or without an advance in the centre. By playing 2...<5)c6 Black copies his opponent's strategy. With 2...<2)f6 he prepares ...d5.
2 Nc3 Nc6
2 ... Q)c6 3 g3
200 FUNDAMENTAL CHESS OPENINGS
If a flank strategy (first maximize your influ- ence in the centre, then - perhaps - open it) is indeed what White has in mind, this is the logi- cal move, but there are two other possibilities: 3 <2)f3 and 3 e3. 3 <2>f3 will be discussed under 2 (see page 214).
3 e3 is a totally different way of preparing
d4. White wants to be able to recapture on d4 with a pawn. Most players prefer to meet this plan by playing ...d5, an eye for an eye. This line is very likely to transpose to other open- ings. After 3.. .I2Af6 4 d4 cxd4 5 exd4 d5 we find ourselves in a Panov Attack of the Caro-Kann (see page 378). while 3...e6 4 d4 d5 transposes to a line of the Tarrasch Defence of the Queen's Gambit Declined (see page 12). 3 ... g6
4 Ng2 Ng7 (D)
If Black then continues to reply symmetri- cally by playing 5...Nf6, he in fact quite sud- denly allows White to play 6 d4. This transposes to the 2 4>)f3 variation (see page 210).
5...e6 (D) is a more flexible move and this
has always been one of Black's most popular defences against 5 4t)f3. After, for instance, 6 O-O *2>ge7 7 d3 O-O, Black will later play ...d5 and reach a satisfac- tory position. Unfortunately this somewhat sleepy variation has been unpleasantly startled of late by the shocking pawn sacrifice 6 d4!?. White is trying to take advantage of the weaken- ing of the d6-square in a tactical manner; e.g.,
6...cxd4 7 41Bb5. Whether this is actually danger-
ous for Black remains to be seen, but it certainly shows that even in a sheltered place like this, venomous tactical tricks are always possible. More reliable tactically, but double-edged in This, a key position in the Symmetrical Eng- a strategic sense, is 5...e5 (D). lish, is a pretty illustration of the consequences of the classical flank strategy that both players have adopted. Both sides have increased their influence in the centre to a degree where it has become difficult for the opponent to play d4 or ...d5 with any hope of success. But this does not mean that the opening struggle has reached a deadlock! White has several plans at his dis- posal and, because of the symmetry'. Black has exactly the same options. The first question that is confronting White is: how to develop the king's knight? The first answer that comes to mind is 5 2)f3.
SYMMETRICAL ENGLISH 201
Black takes an iron gnp on the d4-square while creating space for future expansion on the kingside: e.g., ...f5-f4. White is given con- trol over d5, but just like in the Stonewall Varia- tion of the Dutch Defence (see page 177) it is unclear just how important this is. A character- istic manoeuvre is (after 6 O-O Qge7) 7 Qel, intending to further strengthen control over d5 with Qc2-e3. The plan of a3. Sbl and b4 con- stitutes another major trump card for White. White's second option is to play 5 e3. with the idea of now finally advancing in the centre with Qgc2 and d4. This is a sound enough plan in itself, but it has a major drawback in that the position becomes drawish if Black continues to play symmetrically: 5...e6 6 Qge2 Qge7, and now, for instance, 7 d4 cxd4 8 Qxd4 d5 9 cxd5 Qxd4 10 exd4 Qxd5. Few players have man- aged to create serious winning chances from this position. If Black finds this too dry, the al- ternative 5...e5 6 Qge2 Qge7 might be useful.
5...Qf6 is less logical here, because it does
nothing to stop White from executing his plan with 6 Qge2 O-O 7 d4. Finally, White can adopt the plan that we have just seen as a serious possibility for Black in both the above variations: 5 e4 (D). will have to play 'around' the centre (as will White). A characteristic continuation is 5...Qf6
6 Qge2 d6 7 O-O O-O 8 d3 Qe8, analogous to the
manoeuvre Qel-c2 in the 5 Qf3 e5 line. 5...e6 is also a common response. Anyone studying these variations carefully will start wondering at some point whether it is perhaps worthwhile to postpone this crucial de- cision about a central pawn-formation. This has given rise to a fourth possibility: 5 a3 (D). In fact, this little move has grown into one of White's most popular options. White starts an attack on the flank before developing his king- side any further, which is a complete turning around of the approach of the three previous variations. Against 5...Qf6 or 5...e6 White will play 6 2bl, when Black will have to decide whether to allow b4 or to prevent it with ...a5 at the cost of a weakening of his queenside (the b5-square). Against 5,..e5 he can even play 6 b4 at once for the acceptance of the pawn sacrifice,
6...cxb4 7 axb4 Qxb4, gives White rather a
dangerous initiative, starting with 8 Na3 (for instance 8...Qc6 9 Qb51). This gambit is also possible after 5...c6, although less clear. It is interesting that this is a variation where Black is able to continue playing symmetrically for an almost absurdly long period of time. One of the critical replies to 5 a.3 is 5".a6 6 2b 1 Sb8 with the idea of meeting 7 b4 with 7...cxb4 8 axb4 b5 9 cxb5 axb5 (D). Isn't it beautiful? Both sides have carried out their flank strat- egy to its extreme. Now that they have cleared This particular pawn-formation is often called the Botvinnik System. White has prospects of expansion on both wings. An attack on the quccnside with a3 and b4 is just as feasible as an attack on the kingside with f4-f5. In the meantime, a counterattack in the centre with ...d5 is firmly ruled out. This means that Black

each other's c-pawns out of the way, the road is finally free for a clash in the centre, starting, for instance, with 10 Nf3. But the true 1 c4 player does not know any such doubts or fears. He knows where his chances lie and he will wait for the right mo- ment to take over the initiative. As a result, this variation often leads to exciting and dynamic chess. Both players are fighting for the initia- tive and are prepared to take some positional risks. However, there is an alternative method of playing ...d5 which is also not without venom:
3...e6 (D).
2 Nc3 Nf6
2 ... e>f6 Black breaks the symmetry. He intends to meet White's classical flank strategy with a classical advance in the centre: ...d5.
3 g3 (D)
Just like after 2...Qc6, it is this move which is the most consistent if White wants to pursue a classical flank strategy. But in this case, 3 g3 implies that White does indeed allow his oppo- nent to take the initiative in the centre by play- ing 3...d5. If White feels uncomfortable with this, he should consider returning to the 2 variation by playing 3 <2)f3. The difference from
3 g3 is that after 3 W3 White will always be in
a position to meet ...d5 with d4, if he so wishes. 3 e4. which is the only move that really pre- vents 3...d5, has never been particularly popular, though it cannot be said to be bad. After 3...$)c6 4 <2)f3 a position from the 2 Qf3 variation is reached (see page 208), while 3...e6 transposes to the Flohr-Mikenas Attack (see page 237). 3 ... d5 This is Black's most ambitious interpretation of the Symmetrical English. He in fact takes over from White his natural role of aggressor in the centre. This is precisely why many players do not like this variation as White. They feel that they are being thrown on the defensive, as if they are really playing Black instead of White. If White now goes for the 'automatic' 4 Jtg2, he will have a problem after 4...d5 5 cxd5 exd5. The unpleasant advance 6...d4 is a positional threat and 6 d4 is not the perfect solution, be- cause White will have to recapture with the queen (6...cxd4 7 Rxd4), when 7...4?)c6 gives Black a nice and easy extra tempo for his devel- opment. 4 £T3 is more accurate, when after
4...d5 5 cxd5. 5...exd5 6 d4 transposes to the
SYMMETRICAL ENGLISH 203
Tarrasch Defence (page 12) and 5...Nxd5 6 Jl.g2 <2k6 to the Keres-Parma Variation (page 209). If Black decides to opt for a ...g6 scheme af- ter all. e.g. 3...g6 or 3...Nc6 4 Jlg2 g6, we are back in the 2 Qc3 Aic6 variation (or something akin to it), with Black having committed him- self to a ...£tf6 plan. 4 cxd5 Nxd5
5 Ng2
Now that Black has executed his plan, it also becomes clear where White's chances lie. The pressure exerted by the g2-bishop is palpable. The d5-knight is attacked and behind the knight lies a vulnerable spot at b7, Black has to tread carefully. The obvious move 5...e6?, for in- stance, loses a pawn to 6 Nxd5 exd5 7 Qb3 !. Nor is the 'easy' solution 5...Nxc3 really that easy for, if anything, it is White who is given an easy plan of attack against the queenside: 6 bxc3 g6 7 Sbl '$Bc6 8 'S'a4, etc. But Black's opening plan in this variation is based on a wholly different idea, less obvious and much more ambitious. 5 ... ihcT (D) Bind of the Sicilian Defence with colours re- versed. The key position of this line arises after the following moves.

tv Black is now well on his way to completing a healthy development of his pieces. White needs to act quickly and with a clear aim in mind in or- der to utilize the tiny lead in development that he has. By far the most popular method of doing so is 9 Aid2. If Black then nonchalantly castles (9...O-O) White will exchange on c6 (10 Ji,xc6 bxc6) when a highly characteristic middlegame arises. Practice has shown that Black's doubled pawns are an enduring liability and that it is not easy to divert attention from this weakness by an attack against White's kingside (although this may look a realistic prospect at first sight). For this reason 9...jLd7 has become the main line. White then continues his plan with 10 "2k4 (Z>). This forces Black to make a fundamental decision. If he protects his pawn on e5 with
10...f6. White will intensify the pressure by
playing 11 f4. This will result in a full-scale battle, where a sharp eye for tactical solutions is as much a prerequisite (for both players!) as subtle positional judgement. The alternative is to sacrifice a pawn with the surprising 10...O-O. After 1 1 i.xc6 Nxc6 1 2 Nxe5 Black calmly re- treats his bishop (1 2...jLe8). intending simply to chase away the knight from e5 and pul the bishop back on c6 again.

If White does not do something special now. he will indeed be playing Black soon or, to be more precise: he will find himself in a Maroczy
204 FUNDAMENTAL CHESS OPENINGS
With this in mind, many players prefer
2...£k6, when 3 d4 leaves Black with more op-
tions than just a Maroczy Bind, while if White does not play 3 d4, a plan with ...g6 remains fully possible. 2,..£te6 is in fact one of the two main lines in this position. The other one is 2...'$3f6. This again gives Black a wide range of options for how to deal with 3 d4. It is also a preparation to take the ini- tiative in the centre himself by playing ...d5, in case White does not play d4. Finally, 2...£tf6 also prepares to play ...b6 in some lines, with- out a knight on c6 blocking the diagonal of the bishop that will appear on b7. 2 2>f3 Nc6

It is clear that by playing d4 White has cho- sen a completely different type of plan from the pure flank strategy that wc have seen in the 2
[diagram]
variation is actually much closer to a 1 d4 or a 1 e4 opening than to the flank openings! After this move, Black faces more compli- cated problems than after 2 2Bc3 . Not only does he have to decide on a strategy of his own (for instance, whether he wants to play a quick ...d5). but he also has to anticipate a possible d4 by White. Let us see just how subtle these problems are by considering what Black should do if he wants to play ...g6. It looks completely natural to play
2...g6 immediately and this is indeed not a bad
move at all. but Black should be well aware of the fact that 3 d4 will then land him in a Mar- oczy Bind of the Sicilian Defence: 3...cxd4 4 2xd4 i.g7 5 e4.

position from the Taimanov Variation that arises which is considered to be completely harmless for Black because of the powerful reply 6... .b4 (see page 422), so this is rarely played. The really important variations are 6 a3. 6 g3 and 6 £jdb5.
6 a3 is an odd-looking little move that might
appear to have no merit other than preventing ..Bb4. However, that merit is a considerable one. and poses Black the problem of precisely what he is going to do, knowing that White can tailor his response accordingly (6...d5 7 cxd5 exd5 8 jlg5 with play against the isolated pawn, or 6...jLe7 7 e4 O-O 8 Nf3 with a kind of hedge- hog). The move a3 can also prove of some use in a variety of contexts, as at a later point a b4 advance may become possible. A much more subtle point is that compared with 6 g3, the line
6 a3 Rb6 7 3b3 Qe5 does not threaten ...Rc6
with an attack on the hl -rook! White can also meet 6...Rb6 with 7 <2>db5, intending 8 ±e3, a line in which the move a3 proves very useful.
6 g3 (D) and the subsequent fianchetto of the
light-squared bishop is a common scheme in this type of position. I ifti 1 H 'g This is in fact an excellent illustration of the modem interpretation of both 1 4hf3 and 1 c4. These moves may be used to introduce a flank strategy, but they are equally useful for adopt- ing a classical central strategy after all. Being able to use both these options is a great asset for any white player, giving him maximum flexi- bility in choosing the right plan for any specific match situation and any specific opponent. 5 ... e6 (D)
5...g6 6 e4 again transposes to a Maroczy
Bind of the Sicilian Defence. Although this variation is eminently playable (in spite of the slightly ominous term 'Bind' in its name), not everyone feels at ease in this type of position, where Black has little manoeuvring space and needs to play with great accuracy if he is not to be reduced to passive defence. White strengthens his grip on the centre with- out sticking his neck out as he does with 6 e4. The bishop will also hinder Black's queenside development and support a future attack on that wing. Strangely enough, however, this quiet ap- proach usually leads to a very sharp battle, be- cause it invites Black to counterattack with
6...Qb6. Then 7 £tdb5 Ne5 8 Nf4 4tfg4 9

Ra4!? is a remarkable pawn sacrifice that leads to great complications. Against the plausible reply 7 Nb3 Black has 7...Ne5, attacking the c-pawn and threatening 8...Qc6. White is then practically forced to play 8 e4 after all, inviting yet another sharp rejoinder: 8..Bb4, threaten- ing 9...Nxe4. Again White has little choice: 9 Re2 (D) is practically forced. This brings us to the most critical position of this variation. instead Black has 9...Nb4+ 10 Nd2 Qc7, which reveals the one big benefit of all pawn sacri- fices: they always clear a file or a diagonal! White has to be very careful here. Instead, 7 Nf4 is considered the critical reply. White provokes 7...e5, which seemingly allows White a very favourable tactical exchange: 8 cxd5 exf4 9 dxc6 (D). If White had hoped that 6 g3 would promise him a calm opening, he will be disappointed. He has been forced to play the aggressive and somewhat compromising e4 and in order to chase away the annoying knight from e5 the equally bold i'4 will also be necessary'. Besides, the double-edged exchange on c3 is in the mak- ing and the pawn on c4 is weak. Fortunately for him, the situation does have its positives as well, for Black's attacking play is not without risk. 9...d6 10 f4 "jc6 1 1 Ji,e3 Axc3+ 12 bxc3 c7 is a characteristic follow-up. White is looking to launch an attack on the kingside, while Black will be eyeing the doubled c- pawns. 6 &db5 (D) is a very different sort of move. By threatening to play 7 £sd6+ and 7 Ji.f4. White is hoping to bully his opponent into pas- sivity. Again, a bold counterattack is critical, introduced by 6...d5 in this case, a move which is both a pawn sacrifice and a challenge to play 7&f4. The pawn sacrifice is 7 cxdS Nxd5 8 ><Jxd5 exd5 9 Rxd5. based on the fork 9...'a?xd5 10 Qc7+. But this is not as strong as it looks, for This was a fashionable position back in the 1980s. Many high-level games have demon- strated that Black is doing fine after 9...bxc6 10 Rxd8+ Nxd8 in spite of his fractured pawn- structure and the loss of the right to castle. Again, it is fast and easy development, the re- sult of the many open files, which is the com- pensating factor. After, for instance, 11 3dl+ aLd7 12 <Nd6 Axd6 13 2xd6 Sb8 14 Nd2 Ee8 White is a long way away from creating pres- sure in leisurely fashion against the isolated pawn on c6.

3...g6 is a much more subtle way to discour-
age d4. White is not stopped from playing 4 d4, but a serious problem awaits him in the po- sition after 4...cxd4 5 £jxd4 Ng7. The situa- tion is almost identical to the variation 2 51c3 5Bf6 3 g3 d5 4 cxd5 Q)xd5 5 Jlg2 (see page 203), with colours reversed. The difference is that White has played the extra move 51c3, which turns out - very remarkably - to be not necessarily in his favour. The problem is that 6 5)c2 allows Black to take on c3. a strategic motif which is also important in the reversed variation. After 6... ,xc3+ 7 bxc3 d6 it is by no means certain that White's bishop-pair will be sufficient compensation for his badly dam- aged pawn-structure. Even so, 3,..g6 is not regarded as a particu- larly good move. This is because 3...g6 creates the ideal situation for White to switch to a e3 plan with 4 e3 (D). A natural developing move. White will de- cide whether to play d4, depending on Black's reaction. He also consciously gives Black the opportunity of playing ...d5. 3 ... ~ Black is returning the favour. He too calmly continues to develop his pieces, without post- ing his plan of action. This is the most popular approach, but by no means the only one. Black has at least three alternatives, all directed at ob- structing the advance d4. To begin with, there is the straightforward
3...e5 (D).
R
Then if Black simply continues 4...Bg7 5 d4. he will be unable to stop his opponent from playing the strategically vital d5 advance with a gain of tempo. But because Black has already played 3...g6. it is not easy to find an alternative to 4...Bg7. The standard reaction to any e3 plan, 4...5Bf6 5 d4 cxd4 6 exd4 d5, can be met very forcefully by 7 jLg5. White is threatening to take on f6 and d5. while 7...dxc4 8 Jlxc4 (again) allows the powerful advance 9 d5. This usually leads to a line of the 2 <2)c3 Qc6 variation: e.g.. 4 g3 g6 5 Jcg2 i.g7 (see page 200). An attempt to force d4 by playing the
208 FUNDAMENTAL CHESS OPENINGS
constantly hangs over the position and needs to be carefully evaluated at almost every tum. The main alternative to 4 g3 is in fact the im- mediate 4 d4, leading (after4...cxd4 5 <2)xd4) to a position that I have discussed as part of the 3 d4 variation (see page 204). It is typical of the Symmetrical English and of flank openings in general that they do not necessarily arise via one logical or forced move-order only. Most variations can be accessed from several direc- tions and this is something to be well aware of. Another possibility is to play 4 e4 (D) first (to stop Black from playing 4...d5) and follow up with d4 as soon as possible. This is a highly unorthodox but undeniably solid way of preventing 4 d4. It was introduced in 1990 and has been popular ever since. The point is that 4 5)xd4 is unattractive because after
4...cxd4 the knight on c3 is attacked. Stoically
continuing normal development with 4 g3 is also not self-evidently sound, because of the doubling of pawns that 4...Nxf3+ 5 exf3 in- volves, although this is in fact quite playable - White will continue with Bg2 and d4. The standard reaction is 4 e3 <R2x13+ 5 Qxf3. but it would be a mistake to think that this re- duces Black's knight manoeuvre to a silly loss of time, because the white queen is not well- placed on f3. This is brought home by the fact that, after 5...g6 6 d4 3Lg7, the only sound way of protecting d4 is 7 Wdl. For this reason most players prefer 6 b3 Jtg7 7 Jlb2. Black then has a flexible position with prospects of a possible initiative on the queenside, based on ...a6 and ...b5. A plausible continuation is 7,..d6 8 g3 fib8 9 Bg2 Nf6. White should not overlook a nasty threat in this position: 10. "J.g4. We now return to the position after 3...?2f6
(D):
4 g3 This is one of the most popular variations of the entire Symmetrical English. White tena- ciously continues his strategy of postponing d4. This is in effect an alternative version of the pure flank strategy that we have seen in the 2 4t2c3 ?3c6 variation. The crucial difference is that the 'threat' of playing d4 and ...d5 now This is usually met by 4...e6. We already know from our survey of the 3 d4 variation (see page 205 ) that the position that arises if White now plays 5 d4 cxd4 6 52xd4 forms part of the Sicilian Defence and is considered innocuous. It is sliehtly more subtle to postpone d4 further
SYMMETRICAL ENGLISH 209
with a move like 5 Ae2. A key position then arises after 5...d5 6 exd5 exd5 7 d4. The ques- tion is: can White transform his minimal lead in development into something more tangible? This position is almost identical to the one arising after 2 <2)c3 S)f6 3 g3 d5 4 cxd5 Nxd5 5 J.g2 (see page 203). The difference is the pres- ence of knights on f3 and c6, which slightly re- duces the influence of the bishop on g2. Black should be careful though. If he thinks he can lash out now with 6...e5?, the unpleasant 7 ?)xe5! will teach him a lesson. Three moves have grown into important variations. The most ambitious one is 6... c7, Black prevents d4 and prepares to play ...e5. This is the Rubinstein Variation, which I dis- cussed above via the move-order 2 )c3 <2)f6 3 g3 d5 (see page 203). If Black likes the sort of position that is typi- cal for the Rubinstein, but wants to keep things a little bit more solid, 6...g6 (D) is an interesting alternative. There are now two main lines: 4...d5 and
4...g6.
4...e6 5 jlg2 d5 is also perfectly sound, but
following 6 cxd5 this will normally transpose, either to a position from the Tarrasch Defence of the Queen's Gambit Declined after 6...exd5, or to the Keres-Parma Variation after 6...Nxd5. The latter option will also be available to Black if he plays 4...d5. 2 £tf3 c6 3 Nc3 4 g3 d5 4 ... d5 5 cxd5 xd5 6 ±g2 (D) chettoes his dark-squared bishop first. He does not need to worry about 7 d4, because this only gets White into trouble after the calm 7... .g7. when 8...'?3xc3 9 bxc3 cxd4 is already a nasty threat. The most important starting position of this variation is reached after 7 O-O -ii,g7 8 Nxd5 Qxd5 9 d3 O-O 10 Ne3. White's last move in- troduces the threat of 1 1 sbd4. White is banking on his tender lead in development. That is why he is not afraid of 10... .xb2, which would just play into his hands: after 1 1 2bl Ag7 12 Ra4 White's initiative is already very threatening. The third possibility (and a very important one) is 6...e6, This is the Keres-Parma Varia- tion, a line that can be reached in a multitude of
210 FUNDAMENTAL CHESS OPENINGS
ways. Black's idea here is totally different from the one underlying the two previous variations. Instead of preventing d4, Black assumes that this advance will not be dangerous. If White captures on d5. Black will, as a rule, take back with the e-pawn. The basic position arises after
7 O-O Ne7 8 d4 O-O (D).
6 ... cxd4 7 <Nxd4 O-O
8 O-O (D)
White now has two plans that are fundamen- tally different, but about equally important. The sharpest and most dynamic approach is to play 9 e4. White is hoping to obtain a strong central position here: e.g., 9...Nxc3 10 bxc3 or 9...Nb6 10 d5. The alternative 9 Nxd5 exd5 10 dxc5 Jcxc5 on the other hand, stresses the static aspects of the position. White intends to play against the isolated queen's pawn. Compared to the Tar- rasch Variation (the difference being that a pair of knights has been exchanged). White lacks the possibility of intensifying the pressure against d5 by playing Jlg5. 2 2rf3 Nc6 3 Nc3 £rf6 4 g3 g6 4 ... g6 (D) Black continues to imitate White's play. As we have seen in the 2 4Bc3 Nc6 variation, this tactic can sometimes be sustained for a very long time.

6 d4 This move is the critical test of Black's open- ing play. White is the first to break the symme- try. Anyone who has been reading this chapter from the start will probably have begun to feel that everything is interconnected in this open- ing, that every single variation is closely re- lated to each and every other variation. This is indeed a distinguishing feature of the Sym- metrical English and one that can have both a clarifying and a bewildering effect upon the student. This opening is not so much about concrete and forcing move-orders as about gen- eral strategic motifs and characteristic plans. These plans and motifs keep coming back, sometimes slightly modified, in different vari- ations. And what makes things really confus- ing is that they are the same for both sides! In this position, for instance, we are in effect looking at a situation we have already seen with
SYMMETRICAL ENGLISH 211
colours reversed, via4...d5 5 cxd5 xd5 6 Jtg2 g6 7 O-O .g7. Does the simple fact that it is now 'the other side' to move alter the assessment of this line? Does the extra tempo mean that White sud- denly has chances of an opening advantage in a situation where - with colours reversed - we have just been wondering whether he can equalize? It all depends on just how accurate we want the answer to be. No, generally speaking it does not make a lot of difference and the position can be viewed as about equal. Yes, the one whose move it is will always be in a position to achieve his own characteristic plans first, forcing the opponent to respond, which may entail that the opponent will have to drop 'his' characteristic plans. Now what does this all mean concretely? The following three plans have come to the fore in this position. The simplest and most obvious solution is to play 8...?2)xd4 9 Rxd4 d6 (D). the same as wc saw White play in the 'mirrored' version of this variation.
8...l<jg4 is a surprising alternative. At first
sight it seems unlikely that a primitive knight sortie like this could possibly solve Black's problems, but there are a number of good rea- sons why it can. In case of the logical reply 9 e3, the pawn sacrifice 9...d6 ID) is very promising. If White accepts, 10 $Jxc6 bxc6 1 1 jlxc6 SbS will give Black a substantial initiative against the white queenside thanks to the beau- tiful open diagonal of the g7-bishop and the open b- and c-files. If White declines he sacri- fice and plays a natural developing move like
10 b3 instead. Black has the far from obvious
rejoinder 10...,Nxd4 1 1 exd4 Nh6. followed by ...Nf5, attacking d4. Both these lines are likely to result in a heavy middlegame struggle with chances for both sides. The same pawn sacrifice can be offered im- mediately by playing 8,..d6. Again Black is counting on (or hoping for) compensation in the shape of open files and diagonals, a lead in development and attacking chances on the queenside after 9 Nxc6 bxc6 10 ,4,xc6 Eb8 (or 10,..Jih3). The choice between these three variations is mainly a matter of taste, although it must be added that the last (8...d6) is by far the most ex- perimental of the three.
2 W
2 ... 4T6 (D)
This is one of the most common positions of the entire Symmetrical English. It is of vital A good reply to this is 10 Rd3, taking the sting out of the pawn sacrifice 10...Ae6 (as in the mirror variation), because Black now does not have the threat of ...'?Bd5 to follow this up. This is why 10...aLf5 is much more common. Black provokes 1 1 e4 and only then does he play ll..Be6. Also 10...a6, planning an ad- vance on the queenside (...2b8 and ...b5) is a popular plan.
212 FUNDAMENTAL CHESS OPENINGS
The point of contact with 1 e4 theory is the Maroczy Bind of the Sicilian Defence (1 e4 c5 2 <2)f3 4)c6 3 d4 cxd4 4 5)xd4 g6 5 c4). which has already been mentioned a few times in this chapter. This would arise if Black plays 4...g6 and White were to reply 5 c3 and 6 e4. 4 ... e6 This classical developing move is the main alternative to the equally classical 4...Nc6. which would lead to a variation that I have dis- cussed under 2...?3c6 (3 d4 cxd4 4 <2)xd4 ?)f6; sec page 204). The two moves are closely related and may easily transpose. The main difference is that by playing 4...i2k6 Black concentrates on attempts to undermine the knight on d4 by the sharp ...Qb6, while 4...e6 is geared to moves like ...d5 and ...jLb4(+). The immediate 4...d5 is also possible, but the timing is unfortunate since after 5 cxd5, both 5...<S>xd5 6 e4 and 5... 'xd5 6 <£jc3 give White an extra developing tempo for free.
4...b6 and 4...e5 are more serious. Both of
these variations are of recent origin. A ...b6 set-up was long thought to be strategi- cally dubious in any situation where While can respond with a quick e4. as is the case here, where White can meet 4...B6 with 5 £tc3 Ab7 6 f3 to be followed by e4. With the rise of the Hedgehog Variation and the resulting upgrading of this particular pawn-formation, 4...b6 also came to be accepted as a reasonable line, al- though it is still considered a somewhat cheeky imitation of the 'official' Hedgehog Variation, 3 <jc3 e6 4 g3 b6. which I shall discuss later (see page 216).
4...e5 is a good deal more cheeky still. Black
is in effect trying to add more power to the cen- tral advance ...d5. The idea is to meet the criti- cal reply 5 <2)b5 with a pawn sacrifice: 5...d5 6 cxd5 and now, rather than blundering a piece with 6... xd5?? 7 'fi'xdSl, Black plays 6...Ac5
(D).
At first sight it may seem unlikely that Black should have anything even resembling suffi- cient compensation for the pawn. But practice has shown that Black's chances, based on fast development and the space that ...e5 has given him on the kingside. are not to be underesti- mated. Two immediate problems for White are importance to both 1 c4 and 1 $)f3 (1 ...Nf'6 2 c4 c5). Again, the main variations start with 3 d4 and 3 <Sc3, but in this case 3 g3 too has some in- dependent significance.
2 Nf3 <£jf6 3 d4
3 d4 cxd4
4 2)xd4 (D) This line is a good illustration of how closely interconnected the whole body of opening the- ory really is, for a certain basic knowledge of both 1 d4 and 1 e4 openings is needed if we are to understand this position properly. To begin with: the position itself might very well arise out of a 1 d4 opening, namely 1 d4 Nf6 2 c4 c5 3 5)f3 cxd4 4 <2)xd4. It could even be regarded as part of the Benoni rather than the Symmetri- cal English!
SYMMETRICAL ENGLISH 213

the insecure position of his knight on b5 and the vulnerability of f2. Most games have seen the modest continuation 7 £15c3 O-O 8 e3 (8 e4? <2>g4! would be awkward), when 8...Re7 9 Ji.e2 e4 reveals the long-term problem: Black has managed to isolate White's pawn on d5, which he will now start to lay siege to with moves like ...2d8 and ...?3bd7-b6. This is in fact one of the sharpest and most interesting variations of the entire area of flank openings.
5 g3 (D)
Again, we find ourselves at a crossroads be- tween queen's pawn and flank opening theory. Anyone wanting to meet 1 d4 £tf6 2 c4 e6 with
3 g3 will have to have an answer to 3...c5. His
main options are 4 d5, a Bcnoni, and 4 ?3f3, which, after 4...cxd4 5 Nxd4, brings about the very position that we are looking at here, as pan of the Symmetrical English. The same can be said about 5 4k3. for if Black then plays 5...Ji.b4 and White replies 6 g3, the opening has transposed to a variation of the Nimzo-Indian Defence: 1 d4 Nf6 2 c4 c6 3 ?3c3 Jtb4 4 g3 c5 5 4?3f3 cxd4 6 Nxd4, although this Nimzo-Indian move-order could equally well be said to be leading to a variation of the Symmetri- cal English. The habit of labelling and categoriz- ing opening variations is made to look rather futile here, but the interconnectedness of all opening theory becomes perfectly clear. After 5 g3, Black has a great many reason- able moves, but there are three main lines:
5...d5, 5...Nb4+ and 5,..Rc7.
5".d5 is the most classical move. It shows up a slight disadvantage of White's last move: he cannot very well play 6 cxd5 because after
6...Rxd5 his rook is attacked and 7 Jtg2 is pre-
vented. This means that 6 jLg2 is practically forced, but this again allows Black to make use of the specific features of the position and play
6...e5 7 2)f3 d4. Because 8 2)xe5?? fails to
8... 'a5+, Black is able to make a giant step for-
ward in the centre and in effect take over his op- ponent's natural role of first aggressor. The key position arises after 8 O-O Nc6 9 e3, with the opening battle mainly revolving around the question of whether Black's pawn on d4 is go- ing to be weak or strong after, for instance,
9..Jlc5 10exd4exd4.
5...Jlb4+ (D) could also explode into sharp
play very easily. If White thinks he can keep the position sim- ple by playing the solid 6 Ad2 (instead of 6 Nc3. which again transposes to the above- mentioned line of the Nimzo-Indian), the sharp
214 FUNDAMENTAL CHESS OPENINGS
reply 6...Rb6 will come as a shock. Suddenly there are pawn sacrifices and difficult decisions all over the place. Against 7 Jlg2 the unex- pected 7...&C5 forces the reply 8 e3 (8 Bc3 runs into 8...e5!), which, after 8...Axd4 9 exd4 Rxd4 10 O-O. leads to a sharp and principled fight between Black's material advantage (he can even take a second pawn on c4) and White's lead in development. In case of 7 Bxb4'Slxb4+ Whitc is also forced to sacrifice a pawn. His most solid option (but also the least intimidat- ing one) is to play 7 e3. Likewise, 5...Rc7 (D) also challenges White to a principled fight between the forces of mind and matter. 1 for themselves. If 3...Nc6 we reach a position that we have already looked at on page 208. while 3...g6 4 d4 cxd4 5 Nxd4 sLgT (or 4 e4 Jcg7 5 d4) is the Maroczy Bind Sicilian again. The alternatives 3...d5 and 3...e6 also offer possible transpositions to variations that we have already seen, but these two moves have in- dependent significance as well. In fact these are two of the most important variations of the Symmetrical English.
2 Nf3 Nf6 3 Nc3 d5
3 ... d5 4 cxd5 Nxd5 (D)
IV
The first question is: is it necessary to protect c4? Opinions seem to be evenly divided on this, because 6 Nd2 and 6 <2Bc3 are about equally popular. 6 Jtg2 is played less frequently, be- cause this does not pose any concrete obstacles in the way of Black taking on c4. After the more subtle 6 Nc3, 6...Qxc4 is risky because of 7 e4, attacking the queen. In this case Black usually plays 6,..a6, when 7 sLg2 'Qxc4 again leads to this sharp, difficult-to-judge type of position where While has the short-term advantage of the lead in development and Black has the long- term advantage of the extra pawn. If White now plays 5 g3. the reply 5...<?k6 will bring us back to the well-known territory of the ...d5 variations we have already looked al (see page 209), but because Black has played ...d5 here before White has played g3. there are
2 Nf6 3 c3
3 <Nc3 (D) I guess that by now most readers will be able to spot the most obvious transpositions
SYMMETRICAL ENGLISH 215
a couple of interesting alternatives. Instead of the standard flank strategy (the cornerstone of 5 g3), White can make a U-turn: both 5 d4 and 5 e4 are moves that aim at a classical confronta- tion in the centre. In fact 5 d4 (D) offers Black a choice of transposing to two different 1 d4 openings: 7 4-xdl White's pawn move e4 is more useful than Black's ...c5 and his king will find a com- fortable square on c2. But the most critical reply to 5 e4 is not
5...53xc3, but the sharp 5...43b4 (D).
5...e6 is a Semi-Tarrasch Variation of the
Queen's Gambit Declined (see page 19) and
[diagram]
122). Most players who choose 3...d5 will have one of these transpositions in mind, but there is one other possibility: 5...cxd4, This move leads to a somewhat dry position after 6 xd4 i?3xc3
7 S'xcS 8 e4 e6 with a tiny lead in develop-
ment and an equally tiny space advantage for White. He has to watch out for 9,..Ab4 though. The main lines start with 9 Bb5 and 9 a3. Black's position is solid and if he is happy with a draw, this variation is quite playable. The same two transpositions are feasible af- ter 5 e4 ( D), but there are a couple of major dif- ferences from 5 d4. If Black were to play 5...Qxc3. then 6 bxc3 would indeed transpose to either the Semi-Tar- rasch (6...e6 7 d4) or the Grtinfeld (6...g6 7 d4). But in this specific situation the 'other recap- ture' is an excellent option: 6 dxc3. This move may in fact come as a cold shower to many who. having played 3...d5, are mentally tuned to a dynamic Grtinfeld battle. Queens are ex- changed and the position becomes rather static. Providing he feels confident in this type of po- sition, White may be satisfied. After 6...Rxd1+ White now either has to get in d4 or do some- thing useful with his small lead in development, and preferably both. The immediate 6 d4 cxd4 7 41x04? is not an option because this runs into 7...Qxd4!, win- ning a piece. The main lines are 6 Bb5+ and 6 Jlc4. Both moves lead to highly original positions which are difficult to assess. The point of 6 Ab5+ is to meet 6...418c6 with
7 d4 cxd4 8 a31, when 8...dxc3 9 Rxd8+ *xd8
10 axb4 cxb2 11 jLxb2 produces an endgame where his lead in development and the unsafe position of Black's king promise White enough compensation for the pawn he has sacrificed.
216 FUNDAMENTAL CHESS OPENINGS
If this is already a fairly complicated varia- tion. the difficulties involved in judging 6 -Nc4 are even more complex. To begin with, this move virtually gives up the right to castle, for if Black now plays 6...Nd3+, it would be an out- rage to reply with the meek 7 Axd3. The key position arises after 7 Ne2 Nf4+ 8 'ifcfl *5he6
(D).
Defence (sec page 12). wliile 5..."53x05 is the Keres-Parma Variation (see page 209). 5 i.g2 ±b7
6 O-O Nc7 (D)
One of the main variations here is the pawn sacrifice 9 b4!?, meeting 9...cxb4 with 10 *5 e2. White is poised to play d4, taking control over the centre and pushing Black onto the defen- sive. The loss of the right to castle does not seem to diminish his chances. The king's rook is often brought into play by h4-h5 followed by Bh4. This line rose to prominence around 1980, but theory has never managed to get a firm hold on it. It is clear though that both sides have to be mentally prepared for a gruelling battle. 2 <2rf3 Nf6 3 Nc3 e6 3 ... e6 (D) 4
4 d4 cxd4 5 £3xd4 transposes to one of the by
now familiar d4 variations (see page 21 3). The position after 4 e4 Nc6 has also been discussed before, on page 208. 4 ... b6 This move introduces the Hedgehog Sys- tem. The alternative 4...Nc6 has been treated on page 209. 4...d5 5 cxd5 also offers a familiar picture: after 5...exd5 6 d4 we are in a Tarrasch Black is in effect playing a Queen's Indian Defence, the only difference being that White has not played d4 (yet). Strategically, this is a very delicate situation. After all, playing d4 is widely regarded as White's most powerful plan, but the question is how? The classical recipe is to play 7 d4 without any more ado. The modem variation starts with the seemingly slow, but actually very ambitious
7 Sei.
3...e6 4 g3 b6 5 Ng2 J.b7

7 d4 cxd4
8 Rxd4 (N)
SYMMETRICAL ENGLISH 217
Even though the white queen is obviously vulnerable to an attack on d4, this recapture is widely regarded as the best way of creating pressure. After 8 £jxd4 Bxg2 9 >fcxg2 the ex- change of bishops lessens the tension and Black is given more freedom to develop his queenside properly; e.g., 9..>c8 10 Rd3 c6. It is not so much this specific position as this type of position which became extremely popu- lar in the 1970s and 1980s and which became known during that era as the Hedgehog Sys- tem. The name is appropriate, for Black is in ef- fect curling up on his back three ranks and any- one trying to tackle the Hedgehog without a pair of really thick gloves is likely to get him- self pricked. According to classical positional thinking, Black's pawn on d6 is simply weak and, provid- ing he manages to keep possible breakouts with ...d5 or ...b5 in check, White should gradually be able to demolish Black's position. But innu- merable games by Hedgehog pioneers from the 1970s (among whom Ulf Andersson deserves a special mention) have shown that this view un- derestimates Black's chances. Preventing every possible form of countcrplay is such a hugely demanding task that very few players even get to the stage where any sort of demolition work can be contemplated. I would advise anyone interested in study- ing this opening scheme to concentrate on the strategy first. There arc a number of variations which require some accuracy and theoretical knowledge, but in general understanding the characteristic plans and ideas is far more im- portant. Well then, what arc these ways of attacking d6 and how should Black defend himself against them? What is Black's ideal piece deployment if While docs not force him to respond to any particular threat immediately? It is this type of question that has to be asked again and again in this line and which a student becomes more and more familiar with as his insight into the secrets of the Hedgehog grows. One direct (some would even say primitive) way of attacking d6 is to play 9 b3 O-O and now simply 10 jLa3. Black then blocks off the diag- onal of this bishop by 10...<2)a6 1 1 fifdl 4k 5, when after 1 2 4"Bb5 Nfe4 he has got everything covered. Developing the queen's bishop not at a3 but at b2 is more of a long-term plan. After
10 Nb2 a6 1 1 2fdl 4)bd7 12 e4 Rc7 13 Re3
(D) a key position is reached that may be achieved by a multitude of different move- orders. 8 ... d6 (D) The obvious move 8...Nc6 is well met by 9 Rf4. In fact, it was the discovery that Black's queen's knight is better developed on d7 that was the main reason for the Hedgehog's rise to great popularity during the 1970s. On d7 the knight does not obstruct the diagonal of the b7-bishop nor the c-filc and it can jump to c5, from where it will attack a white pawn on e4. In this type of position, the gain of tempo involved in playing 8...5k6 is of little importance. The white queen is not very well placed on d4 any- way and will usually step back voluntarily.

218 FUNDAMENTAL CHESS OPENINGS
been diminished and the defence of d6 is weak- ened. After 1 1 ...O-O 1 2 3fd 1 Black has to play
12..Jle7, when 13 e4 more or less forces
him to surrender his bishop-pair and play
13... .xe4. A further implication is that after
14 Rxe4 Black is reduced to playing 14...Sa7,
because in view of the dangerous knight ma- noeuvre |5M4-c6, Black's knight will have to stay on b8 for the time being. The rook's pros- pects are not that bad in fact, with both c7 and d7 as useful possible destinations. In general the position remains much more static than in the 9 b3 variation. Black has hardly any influ- ence in the centre but his position is solid. Another characteristic way of attacking d6 is by manoeuvring a knight to e4; e.g., 9 Sdl a6 10Ng5 (D). Had jLf8. Black may continue with ...fiac8 (or ...2ad8), possibly followed by ...Rb8 and ...Aa8. supporting a possible advance ...b5, while removing the queen from the reach of the rook that is likely to appear on cl. Black could follow up with moves like ...Qa8 and ...4*k5, attacking the pawn on e4. As long as the white queen remains on e3 there is also the possibility of playing ...d5 when an exchange of e-pawns (exd5 exd5) is unpleasant for White. In the meantime the f8-bishop covers d6, with pros- pects of rather more active service on g7. 9 .g5 (D), intending to exchange on f6. is a way of keeping things a bit simpler. Like 9 Js.g5, this is a relatively simple plan which demands a certain precision from both players. It seems strange that White suddenly allows the exchange of light-squared bishops which he avoided only two moves ago (by play- ing 8 xd4 instead of 8 #3xd4). But although it is true that in principle this makes Black's posi- tion easier to play, the threat against d6 is very real. After 10...jLxg2 1 1 Nxg2 Black must de- fend himself against Nge4, followed (if neces- sary) by b3 and Aa3. 1 l...£k6 12 W4 Ha7 13

White intends to play d4 only after he has thrown in 8 c4 first. He can then recapture on d4 with the knight without having his king's bishop exchanged. This is a much more aggressive scheme of development than anything we have just seen in the 7 d4 variation. Black now has to decide whether he wants to prevent this plan. 7 ... d6 The true Hedgehog fanatic will never be dis- turbed by anything White comes up with and curl up in his Hedgehog position regardless, but Black does in fact have two solid alternatives:
7...*kie4 and 7...d5. In the latter case he must be
prepared to play a totally different type of middlegame though, for after 8 cxd5, a position arises from 8...exd5 9 d4 that resembles a varia- tion of the Queen's Indian Defence (see page 80), while 8...2>xd5 9 c4 Qxc3 10 bxc3 O-O 1 1 d4 creates the sort of position that we know from the Keres-Panna Variation (see page 210).
8 e4 (D)
This is a key position for the 7 Scl variation. Thanks to the small investment of a single pre- paratory move (7 5el) White has been able to take up a position that is both solid and aggres- sive. White is not concerned with attacking the pawn on d6: he wants to gain space on the kingside with g4. A Hedgehog position is al- ways solid, but in this case Black has to be very careful not to be pushed off the board. An illus- tration of what might happen in this potentially violent line is provided by the sample variation
13...2fe8 14 g4 <2 c5 15 Ji.f2 g6 (in order to
play ...e5, creating counterplay in the centre, without having to worry about 4Bf5) 16 b4 •?kd7 and now the spectacular 17 4)d5l ? exd5 18 cxd5. This positional piece sacrifice has
220 FUNDAMENTAL CHESS OPENINGS
been played a number of times and with great success. After 18...Qd8 White simply carries on with his bulldozer strategy: 19 Nc6 .xc6 20 dxc6. Black has tried to improve on this line in many different ways (for instance by playing
13...h5), but the battle will always be fierce and
highly complicated. 2 £rf3 Nf6 3 g3

The alternative 5...Nc6 can also be met by 6 d4. preventing a possible Rubinstein set-up (6...'2te7 and ...e5) and forcing a type of posi- tion upon the opponent which he (possibly) was not counting on. But you cannot expect something for noth- ing. 3 g3 gives Black a chance to choose a vari- ation which he cannot expect to reach without White's cooperation via any other Symmetrical English move-order (like 3 •5Tc3): 3 ... h6 (D) If White does not want to play 3 d4 (yet), 3 5te3 is the most flexible alternative, but there is also an argument to be made for 3 g3. Against a ...d5 set-up in particular, this move offers some new prospects since, without a knight on c3. the sometimes annoying exchange ...€)xc3 (after cxd5 Nxd5) is ruled out. This may well make a d4 advance (in response to ...d5) more attractive. The immediate 3...d5 is the move most af- fected by this subtle difference, for White can now avoid both the Rubinstein Variation and the ...g6 line (see pages 203 and 209 respec- tively). If, after 4 cxd5 5)xd5 5 Jlg2, Black plays 5...g6. the moment is right for 6 d4 (D). This is because 6...cxd4 7 Rxd4 is awkward for Black, his rook being attacked and 7..Bg7 prevented. This means that he would have to make a small concession and play either 7...Nf6 or 7...1'6. It is probably a better idea to play
6....&,g7, but this leads to Griinfeld-related posi-
tions after 7 e4 or 7 dxc5. which may not be to Black's liking. If White had played 3 Nc3 he would now have the powerful reply 4 e4. Having played 3 g3, there is nothing better than... 4 kg2 Nb7 ID) This position has all the characteristics of the Symmetrical English. But the decision to re- gard it as part of that opening is a random one for it is equally relevant (to say the least) to the opening I 4)f3 $T6 2 c4 b6 (see page 246). As
SYMMETRICAL ENGLISH 221
we shall see, 3 g3 is then one of White's major options, with the reply 3...c5 or 3..Bb7 4 Bg2 c5 leading to the very position that we are label- ling here as a line of the Symmetrical English. This is in fact another example of how inter- connected all openings and variations really are (and how arbitrary any attempt at categoriza- tion is in the end).

Now if Black were to play 5...e6 we would be back in a 'regular' Hedgehog after 6 c3. There is, however, an interesting possibility to play this system in a subtly different way. 5 ... g6 6 £k3 .*.g7 (D) In almost all of the ...g6 variations that we have seen in this chapter, its value depended to a large extent upon the reply d4. How should the situation after an exchange on d4 be as- sessed? In terms of opening theory, this is the first question that needs to be asked. If White chooses a different plan, a ...g6 set-up is usually vindicated. In this case, after 7 d4 cxd4, the natural re- capture 8 Nxd4 has the same drawback as in the Hedgehog Variation, namely that there is little tension left in the position after 8...Bxg2 9 4'xg2. Of course White's position is sound, but so is Black's after 9...O-O 10 c4 Qc7. That is why here loo 8 Qxd4 is regarded as the critical move. Without a weakness on d6 (for Black's e-pawn has not left its original square yet), Black's position is more solid than in the Hedgehog, while the g7-bishop does of- fer some prospects of active piece-play. For in- stance, after 8...O-O there is already the threat of
9...<2)e4.
The alternative 7 Hel, although not bad, is probably less effective here than in the ...c6 variation. With a bishop on g7, both 7...d5 and
7...d6 8 e4 e5 are easier to play, while 7...£te4 is
also quite solid. Reversed Sicilian
1 c4 e5(D)
This move constitutes both the least compli- cated and the most radical reply to the English Opening. It is carefree and it is formidable. It shows up the beauty of 1 c4 and its ugliness. For some it is the reason to play 1 c4. for others it is why they will never even contemplate it. It is the heart of the English Opening. c5. White does not have to react, he must act. It is not a matter of finding the best way to cope with the opponent's initiative, it is a matter of ensuring that the opponent does not get any ini- tiative in the first place! Anyone who deliberately 'missed' the op- portunity of playing 1 d4 just one move earlier, is unlikely to try to prepare the same advance with 2 e3 in this position, which will yield him no more than a rather unglamorous line of the French Defence (2 e3 Nf6 3 d4 exd4 4 exd4 d5 results in the same position as 1 e4 e6 2 d4 d5 3

After 2 ?fc3. Black too lacks the wide range of choice that White has on his second move in the Sicilian Defence. Moves like 2...g6 and
2...f5 are considered slightly inaccurate be-
cause of the firm reply 3 d4. In both cases
3...cxd4 4 Rxd4 produces a position where the
white queen is not badly placed on d4. A more sophisticated way of anticipating 3 d4 is 2...d6 (D), the Smyslov Variation. White now has to face the consequences of his first move. Black has occupied the centre and White will attack from the flank. If he does this feebly or not at all, the traditional roles will soon be reversed, for if Black can freely de- velop his pieces, he will take over the initiative. 2 €lc3 For those who are familiar with the wealth of variations of the Sicilian Defence, it may come as a surprise to find that alternatives to 2 Nc3 are rare and of little theoretical significance. The only other move that has any importance at all is 2 g3 and even this can hardly be called an independent variation. Moves like 2 d3 or 2 e3 are practically never seen. If we compare the situation to the position after 1 e4 c5 2 <2)f3 it is important to note that in that case Black has to anticipate White's im- pending central advance. 3 d4. But after 1 c4 We are again faced with a curious entangle- ment of two different openings here, in this case the English Opening and 1 d4 d6. Both 3 d4 and 3 Nf3 f5 4 d4 e4 5 Ng5 transpose to variations that can also be reached via 1 d4 d6 2
REVERSED SICILIAN 223
c4 e5 (see page 191). A third option, 3 g3, is similar to the Closed Variation and could easily transpose.
2...J .b4 (D), on the other hand, is a move of
a different calibre altogether. Four Knights Variation, but he also has to take
3...f5 into account, when 4 d4 e4 leads to the
same type of position as 2...d6 3 '2)f3 f5 4 d4 e4, a line we have just looked at. Basically, an ...f5 set-up, though always possible, only becomes truly attractive if White has already played 5)13, for this will allow Black to meet d4, the most principled reply, by ...e4 with gain of tempo. 3 g3 Now 3...f5 is slightly less accurate (although it should be stressed that even here this advance is not what you call bad). White continues 4 ±g2 Nf6 5 e3 followed by d4 and if Black then replies ...e4, White can immediately eliminate Black's intimidating outpost at e4 by playing f3. 3 ... g6 4 i.g2 Ng7 (D) This is the youngest variation of the Re- versed Sicilian, nameless as yet, but very popu- lar already. It is a provocative move, for 3 Qd5 looks like a plausible and strong reply. Why should Black give his opponent an aggressive move like that for free? The point is that the knight is not safe on d5. Black simply with- draws the bishop and chases away the knight with ...c6. This can lead to a fierce opening struggle. Black can play 3...Ba5 4 b4 c61, or
3..Bc5 or even 3... .e7. In the latter case. Black
assumes that after an exchange on e7 (e.g., 4 d4 d6 5 e4 ?)f6 6 <$jxe7 Rxe7) his lead in devel- opment will compensate for the loss of the bishop-pair. Here too, 3 g3 is a calmer reply. The traditional main lines start with 2...Nc6, the Closed Variation, and 2...(5Af'6, which gen- erally leads to the Four Knights Variation. Closed Variation 2 ... Qc6 (D) By analogy with the Closed Sicilian (1 e4 c5
2 Nc3), this move is called the Closed Varia-
tion. Black is more concerned with preventing a possible d4 than with making a move in the centre of his own (,..d5). If White now plays 3 Nf3, the reply 3...?)f6 will transpose to the This is the main starting point of the Closed Variation. In the course of almost a century.
224 FUNDAMENTAL CHESS OPENINGS
many games have been played from this posi- tion, making it one of the oldest in the entire English Opening. Perhaps somewhat surpris- ingly though, there are hardly any clearly de- fined variations. For the time being there is little or no direct contact between the opposing armies. In a situation like this there is usually little need for concrete and precise move- orders. It is all about long-term strategic plan- ning. Speaking very generally, one could say that White has two standard plans: he can become aggressive on the queenside or in the centre, in which case his attack will be directed at e5. The most common form of an attack on the queenside is to play 2bl, followed by b4-b5. This is often (but not always) combined with d3 and £tf3. White allows his opponent a free hand on the kingside. A plan of action in the centre will normally be based either on e3 in combination with £}ge2, or on e4. The latter move creates the opportunity of attacking e5 from the flank with f4. If we translate these abstract considerations into concrete variations, White has the follow- ing moves: First of all, he can decide to develop his kingside first, starting with 5 Qf3. and concen- trate on the queenside later. After 5...d6 6 d3 Nf6 7 O-O O-O for example, he could play 8 Hbl (D), preparing 9 b4. This position, which can be reached in a multitude of different move-orders, is in fact one of the most popular in the entire range of flank openings. White now fully concentrates his forces on the queenside and Black will have to find coun- terplay on die kingside. A characteristic (though by no means forced) continuation is 8...a5 9 a3 h6 (in order to play ...Be6 without being trou- bled by £}g5) 10 b4 axb4 1 1 axb4 Ae6 12 b5 <5?.e7 13 .lb2 Qd7, intending 14... ,h3. White could also start by playing 5 Hbl. postponing W3 to a later stage and keeping the options of a development with e3 or e4 open. By playing 5 e3. White emphatically creates the possibility of an advance in the centre (d4), yet he does not commit himself to such a plan. On the contrary, the whole point of this varia- tion is to threaten to play d4, not necessarily to play it. Black must constantly be on his guard for this advance, which requires some subtle as- sessments. If 5...d6 6 Clge2 Nf6, for instance, 7 d4 is a perfectly sound move and very annoying for Black. If Black plays 6...Nge7 (instead of
6...i<lf6), the situation is different: now, after 7
d4 exd4 8 exd4 O-O, Black is well-placed to at- tack the enemy centre with moves like ...jLg4 and ...Nf5. This explains why 6...Nge7 is usu- ally met by 7 O-O O-O 8 d3 or 8 3b 1, not by 7 d4. An interesting reply to 5 e3 is a swift ad- vance on the kingside: 5,..h5. By introducing the threat of ...h4. Black is testing the strength of his opponent's kingside defences (and his nerves). This provocative line came into fash- ion around 1980 and is still quite popular. Finally, While may choose the same pawn- formation that we have seen in the chapter on the Symmetrical English under the name of the Botvinnik Variation (see page 201): 5 e4. White concentrates on neutralizing any possi- ble enemy initiative on the kingside. The stan- dard scheme of development comprises moves like 5)ge2, d3, O-O, Ne3 and Rd2. White has the long-term prospect of playing either b4 or f4, or both. Four Knights Variation 2 ... Nf6 (D) By playing this move, Black makes it clear that he does not resign himself to White's dom- ination of the central square d5, which so mark- edly defines play in the Closed Variation. Black
REVERSED SICILIAN 225
intends to diminish that domination by playing ...Bb4 or even to neutralize it completely with ...d5, the very strategy that is regarded as criti- cal (with colours reversed) in the Sicilian De- fence. He docs not have to be afraid of 3 d4, a move that is crucial (or at least highly relevant) after
2...g6, 2...f5 and even the much stronger 2...d6,
for in this case the position after 3...exd4 4 Qxd4 <2Bc6 is (even) easier for Black than after
2...d6 3 d4 exd4 4 Rxd4. his dark-squared
bishop still having prospects of getting devel- oped very actively at c5 or b4. If White wants to play this type of position it is much better to throw in 3 Nf3 4)c6 first, when 4 d4 exd4 5 4jxd4 keeps the white queen safely out of reach of Black's queen's knight. 3 '2)f3
3 g3 is also played fairly often. This move is
intended to give White some extra options for dealing with 3...Bb4 (as compared to 3 Nf3 Nc6 4 g3 Bb4). With his king's knight still on gl , he can meet this move with 4 e4, followed by Nge2. If Black chooses 3...d5, then White's choice of third move has little independent sig- nificance. The plausible 4 cxd5 4t)xd5 5 Jig2 4)b6 6 <2)f3 4t3c6 will lead to the position that we shall encounter under the heading of 3 4bf3 <2)06 4 g3 d5. 3 ... "3c6 (D) Since about 1900, this position has been the starting point for most of the theoretical discus- sions of the Reversed Sicilian. With his care- free and aggressive opening play, Black has made optimal use of the freedom of movement that White has given him by opening I c4. Now the moment has come for White to justify his first move. The various ways in which White has tried to do this form an excellent illustration of the evo- lution of opening theory over more than a cen- tury'. For a very long time, until around 1970, 4 d4 was regarded as the main line. White takes the initiative in the centre, a classical strategy. After that. 4 e3 held the limelight for about a decade. This is much more flexible, although still based on the same view of the situation. White introduces the possibility of taking back on d4 with a pawn, but. more importantly, he prepares to deal with the aggressive ...Ab4, which is the main problem after 4 d4, in an alto- gether different way. But in the mid-1980s it was 4 g3 that rose to ever greater popularity until it finally overshad- owed its two predecessors completely and be- came the 'self-evident' main line. White does not hurry with d4 and increases his influence in the centre instead by putting a bishop on g2. This is the pure flank strategy that we know so well from the Symmetrical English. It is very tempting to call this the most logical move in the opening scheme that was started with 1 c4. but just to illustrate the relative value of this ep- ithet I would like to mention that various theo- retical works from every period of the 20th century have emphatically given 4 d4 and 4 e3 that honour... Naturally, in a calm position like this there are many playable moves. Especially the wait- ing moves 4 a3 and 4 d3 and the rather wooden
226 FUNDAMENTAL CHESS OPENINGS
4 e4 are played fairly often, but there is little to
say on these moves in a theoretical sense and perhaps that is precisely their strength (or weakness). Moves like this should not be seen as ways to create or advance opening theory, but as attempts to avoid it.

d6 9 f3. White will build up a strong pawn- centre with e4. and Black will break the nasty pin against the f6-knight with the manoeuvre ...Qie5-g6. Both sides will have to make an effort to let the positives of their respective positions prevail over the negatives after, for instance,
9...Ne5 10e4 g6 11 Nf2 O-O.
2 c3 Nf6 3 f3 c6 4 e3
4 e3 (D)
White immediately attacks Black's central outpost at e5 and stops his opponent from in- creasing his influence in the centre by means of ...d5. It could be said that by playing 4 d4 White decides to go for a 1 d4 opening after all. The theoretical assessment of this approach has seen great changes over the years. Nowadays it is re- garded as sound, but not particularly threaten- ing for Black. There are two fundamental replies, 4...e4 and 4...exd4, After 4...c4 5 <R2)d2 Black has a choice be- tween the open type of position resulting from
5...<2Bxd4 6 <2)dxe4 and the more complex posi-
tion after 5...Bb4. The alternative 4...exd4 combines these two qualities, for the position after 5 <?3xd4 .J*.b4 (D) is at the same time open and complicated. This is in fact a fairly treacherous and double-edged variation. White will have to accept some dam- age to his pawn-formation in return for obtain- ing a firm grip on the centre. A characteristic (though by no means forced) continuation is 6 Jtg5 h6 7 Ah4 ,xc3+ 8 bxc3 This little move has been known since the beginnings of the English Opening, but for a long time it led a very modest existence in the shadow of 4 d4. And then, quite suddenly, in the mid-1970s, everybody started to play it. Al- most overnight, 4 e3 turned from a wallflower into the star variation of the Reversed Sicilian. Nowadays, although 4 g3 has taken over the top position, it remains a move to be reckoned with.
REVERSED SICILIAN 227
The problem for Black is that the bold reply
4...d5 is strongly met by 5 cxd5 4Bxd5 6 Jt.b5,
followed if necessary by d4. Meekly waiting for White to decide whether to play d4 is also not to everyone's liking, al- though 4...Be7 does in fact have a solid enough reputation. Because after 5 d4 exd4 the aggres- sive 6 exd4 is well-countered by 6...d5, White has to be a little more prudent and play 6 $)xd4 instead. We then have almost the same position as after 4 d4 exd4 5 <3xd4 .b4, with the extra moves e3 and ...Jle7 taking the edge off the tension. ,.. .e7 is less aggressive than ...Bb4, while c3 hems in the queen's bishop. But no matter how good or bad these alter- natives are. the crucial reply to 4 e3 has been since times immemorial a move which com- bines the aggression of 4...d5 with the sound- ness of 4...Jte7. yet is totally different from either of them: 4 ... Jtb4 Introducing the possibility of an exchange on c3, which will reduce White's control over the central squares considerably.
5 Qc2 (D)
An important point of 4...Jcb4 is that 5 Nd5 e4 leaves White without a good square for the knight. 6 Ngl is unimpressive, while after 6 (7Bxb4 €Bxb4 7 <R3d4 c5 Black is already taking over the initiative. the bishop, Black would have no problems. It is this position which harbours the secret of the enormous popularity of 4 e3 during the 1970s, for it was the discover}1 of the highly unortho- dox move 7 Rf5l? which caused all the prob- lems for Black. The idea is a purely positional one: White wants to saddle his opponent with doubled f-pawns. The fact that 7...!23xd5 8 cxd5 loses a pawn is of vital importance, for this means that Black has no 'easy' answer to 7 Rf5. The critical line is 7...d6 8 Nxf6+. when Black can choose between the sharp 8...gxf61?
9 Rh5 d5 and the rather more cautious 8...Rxf6
9 Qtf6 gxf6.
After a while, the alternative 5...Jlxc3 6 Rxc3 '&Ie7 was developed, mainly by players who did not like being forced into these dou- ble-edged lines. At the cost of his bishop-pair, Black neutralizes his opponent's influence in the centre. Black can hope to take over the ini- tiative by playing ...d5.

With this move we are walking onto the Cen- tre Court of the Reversed Sicilian. This is the arena where for the past twenty-odd years most of the theoretical discussions have been held, most of the gladiator fights have been fought and most of the theoretical progress has been made. Unlike 4 d4 and 4 e3, 4 g3 makes no attempt to prevent Black from playing ...d5. The first move to be considered then, must be 4...d5. The first move to be played in this position was 5...O-O, This allows 6 ;?3d5. but it was thought that after the cold-blooded 6...Se8, threatening 7...e4 and freeing the f8-square for
228 FUNDAMENTAL CHESS OPENINGS
Another plausible and powerful move is
4....4b4. yet the consequences of this are to-
tally different from 4 e3 Jfb4. Then there is the straightforward developing move 4...Bc5, quite a popular move in fact, as is the tricky 4...Nd4, Other moves, like 4...g6 (D) for instance, are relatively unexplored. normal Dragon Variation defuses what would 'normally' be the most powerful anti-Dragon scheme: ...Jle6, ...f6, ...'S'd? and ...O-O-O fol- lowed by a storm on the flank with ...h5-h4. If
6...Be6 7 O-O f6. then 8 d4 will break open the
centre and disrupt Black's plan. Another aggressive idea, 6...Nxc3 7 bxc3 e4, is also not dangerous for White. After the simple 8 £}gl Black will have trouble protect- ing his e4-pawn. 8..Jk.f5?l is met strongly by 9 Ra4, when 9...Re7 10 2bl O-O-O loses to 11 Rb5. and if. e.g., 8...f5 9 d3 exd3 10 exd3, Black would probably dearly love to consoli- date the vulnerable a2-g8 diagonal with the im- possible move ...f5-f7. In order to avoid these problems, Black is obliged to choose a much more conservative plan. 6 ... Allowing White to play d4 is generally re- garded as a minor concession and is not overly popular. Theory does not go much deeper than claiming that if play continues 5 d4 exd4 6 51xd4 .Ng7, then exchanging on c6 is critical and that after 7 Nxc6 bxc6 8 jlg2 Black will have some trouble getting his queen's bishop developed. 4g3 d5 4 ... d5 5 cxd5 <23xd5 6 jLg2 (D) This is a position from the Dragon Variation of the Sicilian Defence with colours reversed. But what does this mean? Is it just a matter of a can of paint, with White now playing with black pieces and vice versa? What is it really that justifies White in playing the opening 'as if he is playing Black'? The answer to these questions and the secret of all 'reversed' openings is the extra tempo. In every position where it would 'normally' be Black's move it is now White's. This invisible and difficult-to-evaluate difference from the
REVERSED SICILIAN 229
This is the most important starting point of this variation. Black has consolidated his spa- tial advantage in the centre. For the time being this situation is not particularly threatening for White, but given time Black will eventually start a potentially dangerous attack on the king- side with ...f5 and perhaps ...g5-g4. Another sound plan for Black is to strengthen his grip on the centre with ...f6, ...jle6 and ...'tfd7, per- haps followed by ...'2)d4. White's chances lie on the queenside. A plausible plan is to advance the a- and b-pawns. gaining space and indirectly threatening the e5-pawn. Another standard ma- noeuvre is 5)d2-b3-c5 or 21a4/e4-c5. bringing considerable pressure to bear on Black's queen- side pawns. Understanding the positional aspects of this position and the various characteristic plans of action is in fact much more important than knowledge of concrete variations. To begin with, White can play 8 a4, intend- ing to carve a hole in Black's queenside imme- diately with a5-a6. But although this is quite an attractive prospect in itself, 8 a4 is not held in high regard because the simple reply 8...a5 gives Black control over the important square b4, making it more difficult for White to create in- roads on the queenside.
8 d3 O-O 9 Be3 (D) is less compromising and
for a long time this was the main line of this variation. eliminated Black's central pawn. A safer reply to 9 Be3 is 9... .e6. But nowadays the most popular plan is to gain space on the queenside with b4. The most common way of implementing this idea is to play 8 a3. Although here too Black can play 8...a5, this is now less painful for White than if he had played 8 a4, for now it is not White who gives up control over an important square (b4), but Black (b5). White will switch to another plan. 9 d3 O-O 10 Be3 for instance, and be happy. For this reason most players on the black side just allow b4. After 8...O-O 9 b4 j£_e6 (9...Se8 is also viable, as 10 b5?l Nd4 1 1 Nxe5 Jtf6 is good for Black), for instance, the threat of
10 b5 is elegantly parried by 10...Nd4, when 1 1
[diagram]
renews the threat. After 10...1'6 11 d3 (D) this leads to a position which is of crucial importance for the entire opening. Black has tried both 1 l...<2kl4 and 1 l...a5 12 b5 Nd4 here. The point of inserting ...a5 is that in some cases ...a4 will clamp down White's queenside and allow Black to take over the ini- tiative on that wing; e.g.. 13 Nxd4 exd4 1 4 4he4 a4, when both b5 and a3 become vulnerable. White should probably play a move like 13
[diagram]
The modern way of preparing b4 is to play 8 Sbl. Now. after 8...O-O, White can play 9 b4 without any further preparation, as 9...Jlxb4'?! is met by 10 ?Bxe5!, winning back the pawn, in the process eliminating Black's central strong- hold. Illustrative of this position's volatility is 9...f5 10 b4!?, when after 10...Nxb4?! 11 Rb3+Nh8 12 <2)xe5 White can be satisfied about having
230 FUNDAMENTAL CHESS OPENINGS
This move is now more appropriate than af- ter 4 e3 Jtb4, because the aggressive reply
5...c4 does not force 6 £tgl: White can play 6
Nh4. Of course h4 is not the ideal square for a knight, but White's development is not hin- dered and Black will have to take care not to lose his e-pawn. Another critical reply is 5...41xd5 6 cxd5 ?jd4 7 Nxd4 exd4. The presence of no fewer than four d-pawns makes this a mysterious po- sition. Both sides are facing some fundamental and bewildering problems concerning pawn- formations. How. for instance, should Black re- spond to a possible e3 or e4? And if he decides to take on e3 (...dxe3), should White recapture with his d- or with his f-pawn? The least committal reply to 5 £fd5 is to re- treat the bishop: 5...i.c5. Black refuses to be drawn into complications and maintains a flexi- ble position. The crucial question after 5...Xc5 is whether d5 is actually a better square for the knight than c3. for this is by no means certain. After, e.g., 6 3Lg2 O-O 7 O-O d6 and now either 8 d3 (intending to play 9 3Lg5) or 8 e3 (intending to play 9 d4) a delicate situation has arisen. Whom is a possible exchange of knights on d5 going to favour? The answer will be slightly different in every slightly different position.
5 ... O-O
Another difference from the variation 4 e3 Jib4 is that 5...<fcxc3 can now be excellently met by 6 bxc3 in combination with O-O. d3, e4, followed by <21114 and f4. If he can achieve this plan without disturbance, White will get a firm grip on the centre, enabling him to start an at- tack on the kingside at his leisure. Taking back on c3 with the d-pawn is also not bad. but decidedly less aggressive. This is usually played in positions where the standard plan after bxc3 is not feasible.
6 O-O e4 (D)
Black takes the initiative in determining the type of middlegame. Alternatives like 6....e.xc3,
6...5e8 and 6...d6 arc not bad. but they have al-
ways been less popular than 6...e4. The latter two lines depend mainly on how good (or bad) the reply <2)d5 is. Taking on c3 is only advis- able if Black has a concrete plan to throw a spanner in the works of White's standard plan.
4 g3 Ab4
4 ... Nb4 (D) This move creates a totally different sort of tension. The position remains flexible, but fairly closed and the struggle is more about long-term positional problems. Much more than 4...d5, a move which is popular al all levels, this is a variation for the heavyweights. Top players have always found this variation to their liking, while the average club player has stayed aloof. But whether this is a recommendation is for the reader to decide! The first problem now confronting White is the possible exchange of minor pieces on c3. Is this a threat - and if not. how should White re- capture?

For a long time most opening manuals gave
5 Nxe5 as the critical reply, but in practice this
has never been a popular choice. The point, of course, is 5... xe5 6 d4, when White gets his piece back with a good position, but 5...Axf2+
6 Nxf2 'SlxeS is stronger and enthusiasm for
this somewhat odd position has never been great. In the long run White's central pawn- majority may become a positive factor, but for the time being White will need all the energy he can muster for a successful reintegration of his king. 5 ... d6
6 O-O O-O (D)
There are two fundamentally different moves in this position. For a long time 7 Qel, intending to meet
7...Axc3 with 8 dxc3, was the main line. Black
continues 8...h6, preventing 9 Ag5, when a rather static position arises, where both sides will have to manoeuvre very patiently. 7 4Bg5 is riskier and more aggressive. Now the plan is to meet 7...Axc3 with 8 bxc3, when after 8...Se8 White has two ways of attacking the pawn on e4: 9 d3 and 9 f3. Two games from the 1987 match for the world championship be- tween Kasparov and Karpov have demonstrated how extremely difficult these positions arc. es- pecially after 9 f3. White is hoping that Black will meekly play 9...exf3. when 10 4Bxf3 fol- lowed by d3 and e4 gives White a strong central position, but Black can play 10...d5, taking the initiative in the centre himself. Even more double-edged is the positional pawn sacrifice

Remarkably, it differs from a position of the 4...Ab4 5 <21d5 Ac5 line in one respect only: White's queen's knight is on not d5. but c3.

In- stead, White has 6 f4 d6 7 <5X13, maintaining an extra pawn, but nobody has ever shown great interest in trying to prove that this material ad- vantage compensates for White's rather crum- pled-up position. 5 ... 2)xf3+

from this tiny difference. Perhaps White's posi- tion is a little more flexible with his knight still on c3. He can try to take the initiative with a3 and b4 or with e3 and d4. Black has a solid and well-developed position with prospects of coun- terplay on the kingsidc. 7 d3 h6 (to prevent 8 Bg5) 8 a3 a6 9 b4 Ba7 10 J.b2 Ji.e6, intending 1 l...Rd7 followed by 12..JLh.3, would be char- acteristic follow-up.

4 ... Nd4(T)) This position docs not contain (he weighty and far-reaching strategic problems of the
4... .b4 variation. 7 d4 is not particularly strong
because of 7...e4. The most popular move is 7 Qb3. when Black's most light-footed reply is
7...jlc5. White's queen is then (perhaps) less
well placed on b3 than it was on di, because on b3 it is blocking the flank advance b4-b5 and not supporting the central advance d4. After 8 O-O O-O 9 Na4 Ae7 10 fidl the struggle is slowly heating up. White has more space, but Black has a solid position without any weak- nesses. Although this move is based on a nasty open- ing trap, it is actually an exchange of knights and a consequent simplification of the position that Black is after. Paradoxically then, it is in fact the most defensive of Black's fourth-move options. As such, it enjoys a good reputation.

Black is hoping that his opponent, after play- ing 5 Q>xe5 and facing the reply 5...Re7, will

another opening. I shall just briefly outline these alternatives here:
1...e6 is played almost exclusively for meet-
ing 2 ?k3 with 2...d5. when the threat of 3...d4 practically forces White to play 3 d4, which transposes to the Queen's Gambit Declined. If White does not relish this prospect he will nor- mally play 2 W3 d5 3 g3 £jf6. a Reti-like set-up discussed on page 243. 2 e4, which may look like a powerful advance in the centre at first glance, actually transposes to an innocuous side- line of the French Defence (see page 349).
1...c6 has a similar background. Here too,
the idea is to transpose, after 2 <2)c3 d5 3 d4, to a Queen's Gambit, in this case the Slav (or an Ex- change Slav after 3 cxd5 cxd5 4 d4). Likewise, 2 4)f 3 d5 3 g3 (or 3 b3), with a transposition to the Rcti Opening (see page 251), is a major al- ternative. But an important difference from l...e6 is that in this case 2 e4 is a move to be reckoned with, for this transposes to one of the more testing lines against the Caro-Kann (sec page 376). By playing l...g6 (D). Black is thinking along King's Indian lines.
1 c4 (D)
l...c5 and l...e5, the two moves we have looked at so far, deserve to be called the most important moves in this position, because these are the two ways in which Black can immedi- ately dictate the course of the opening. They are the two most ambitious and the most principled moves. After l...c5 or l...e5 there is no way back for White, nor for Black. The stage for the opening struggle is set. But Black can also react in a totally different way, or perhaps I should say: it is also possible not to react at all. In that case, the most obvious and the most popular reply to 1 c4 is... 1 ... f6 Black simply develops a piece, without mak- ing any announcements concerning his plans for the future. He allows his opponent to 'cor- rect' his opening move by playing 2 d4 and in fact challenges him to show that 1 c4 really is a move which can look after itself. So, in a more indirect way, this is as good a test of the merits of 1 c4 as are l...c5 and l...c5. There are a few other moves as well, which are by no means bad, but which lack the ex- tended set of variations of 1...<2Af6. Most of them are specifically designed for a transposition to lion from 1 d4 g6, with a possible further
234 FUNDAMENTAL CHESS OPENINGS
Defence with 2...e6 or 2...3Lb7 followed by
3...e6 is critical, but many players will want to
avoid this double-edged opening by playing 2 "2>f3 Jcb7 3 g3 instead. In that case 3...<2hf6 transposes to a position that we shall return to later in this chapter. For those who prefer the fringes of opening theory, there is the adven- turous alternative 3... .xf3. At the cost of his bishop-pair, Black saddles his opponent with doubled pawns. We now return to L.A)f6 (D): transposition to a 'real' King's Indian Defence. If White avoids this and persists in a pure flank strategy, e.g. by playing 2 4bc3 <SLg7 3 g3. the opening will sooner or later take on the features of another English variation. An ...e5 set-up will lead to positions similar (or identical) to the Closed Variation of the Reversed Sicilian, while ...c5 will transpose to a line of the Sym- metrical English. A transposition to the Lenin- grad Variation of the Dutch also remains an option. If the Dutch Defence is what Black is think- ing of, he can of course play L..f5 (D) straight- away. There are two main lines from this position (not counting 2 d4): 2 Nc3 and 2 $)f3. At first glance this may not look like an im- portant division. Is it not completely arbitrary in which order these sound developing moves are made? But behind these two moves lie two totally different ways of anticipating the wide range of possible opening strategies that Black has at his disposal. Obviously, the first difference between the two knight moves is that 2 <R3c3 again allows both 2...e5 and 2...c5, and 2 Nf3 only the latter, but this is not something that will unduly worry the 1 c4 player. The real decision at stake is about the great issues that also dominate the 1 d4 openings. How is White going to respond to a King's Indian set-up, to a Griinfeld, or to a Nimzo/Queen's Indian scheme? And what hap- pens if Black were to switch to a Queen's Gam- bit with 2...e6 or 2...c6, followed by 3...d5? This subtle 'move-order game' is in fact one of the most prominent features of modem open- ing play. Many players with a 1 d4-oriented If White then refuses the invitation for a trans- position, either immediately (2 d4) or on one of his next moves, he will in the first place have to consider the consequences of ...e5 at some point. For instance, someone who has just studied the previous chapter of this book, will (perhaps) play 2 £jc3 and not be afraid of 2...e5. because in that case 3 d4 has a good reputation (see page 222). But after 2...*2)f6 3 Nf3 g6 4 g3 Bg7 5 Jlg2 O-O 6 O-O d6. he will have to make a choice between a main-line Leningrad Dutch with 7 d4 (seepage 181) and something more modest, like
7 d3 e5 8 Sbl. which will then be similar to a
Reversed Sicilian. If he chooses the latter, he will be leaving the $afe(?) and well-charted terri- tory of the 'official' opening theory behind, yet anyone playing this regularly is likely to develop his own set of variations very quickly. Finally. L..b6 is a move to be reckoned with. After 2 d4, a transposition to the English

opening repertoire use the flank opening moves
1 c4 and I Nf3 as side doors to their favourite 1
d4 openings, some to avoid a Benoni, some to avoid a Queen's Gambit Accepted, some per- haps to simplify the complexity of the Griinfeld or the Nimzo-Indian Defence. In fact, everyone who plays 1 c4 or 1 Nf3 with a purpose like this will have reasons of his own and will develop a clearly defined footpath of his own to lead him through the jungle of variations. Then of course there are those who cannot be bothered with subtleties like this and who just want to play a flank opening. For those players any division between 2 <2)c3 and 2 £\f3 is indeed artificial and completely superflu- ous.
2 Nc3
2 €k3 <D) 2 €3c3 e6 A natural choice for lovers of the Nimzo- Indian Defence, who are probably looking for- ward to seeing 3 d4 now. However, White has two major alternatives. First, there is 3 e4, the Flohr-Mikenas Attack, an aggressive varia- tion requiring considerable alertness from Black. Second, there is the sober developing move 3 <2)f3. The real Nimzo-fanatic will per- haps regard this as just as 'good' as 3 d4 and play 3...jLb4, but the absence of a pawn at d4 makes this a totally different type of position.
3 g3 is less accurate in this position, because
after 3...d5 Black is threatening 4...d4. White parries the threat quite easily with 4 d4, but the problem is that he then finds himself in a spe- cific version of the Catalan Opening where c3 is not often the best square for his queen's knight.
B
The most important moves in this position (apart from 2...c5 and 2...e5 of course) are 2...e6.
2...g6 and 2...d5.
An attempt to reach a Slav Defence with
2...c6 has never been particularly popular, prob-
ably because the reply 3 e4 makes life relatively more difficult for Black here than in the compa- rable variation 2...e6 3 e4. For the same reason, 2...b6 has also never quite 'made it'. The problem again is 3 e4, when 3... .b7 4 e5 Ne4 is not the safe reply it is in the variation 2...e6 3 S)f3 b6 4 e4 Bb7 5 e5 (see page 240), because of the annoying 5 Flohr-Mikenas Attack
3 e4 (D)
This move poses a concrete problem. A timid reaction like 3...d6, which allows White to play 4 d4, is not really an option, at least not accord- ing to the high standards of opening theory. Black will either have to strike back in the cen- tre immediately, by playing 3...d5. or he will have to try to expose a fundamental weakness of White's third move: the d4-square. This may be attempted with the provocative 3...c5.
236 FUNDAMENTAL CHESS OPENINGS
attack? These problems have resulted in some intriguing variations. White's oldest move in this position is the natural 7 d4 and Black's first reply to this was
7...c5. White then plays 8 4£}f3, introducing the
annoying possibility of harassing the black queen with Ag5. Around 1990 the sharper
7...e5 became popular. Like 7...c5, this move
immediately attacks White's central formation, but it has the added advantage that the diagonal of the light-squared bishop is cleared, the de- velopment of which is one of Black's funda- mental problems in the 7...c5 variation. It is true that after 7...e5, 8 Qe2 wins a pawn, but. sur- prisingly perhaps, it appears that 8...iLe7 gives Black fully sufficient counteiplay after 9 dxe5 Qg6 or 9 Rxe5 Qxe5+ 10 dxe5 Nc6 1 1 Nf3 Jlg4. Black's pieces are much more actively placed than White's, underlining the vulnera- bility of the doubled pawns. For this reason, most players have changed their preference from 7 d4 to 7 Nf3 over the years. The idea of this move is simply to trans- pose after 7...c5 8 d4 and to meet 7...e5 with a totally different plan, starting with the highly unorthodox 8 .d3 (D).
2 c3 e6 3 e4 d5

Ebl. The result of the complicated exchange of pieces is that White now has doubled pawns on the c-file and that Black's queen is on an un- usual square. This position is not easy to judge. Do the doubled pawns support White's central position or arc they a liability? Is the black queen actively placed at f6 or vulnerable to an

This fascinating position, where White has the bishop-pair, a space advantage and the ini- tiative. while Black has an extra pawn, is one of the most theoretically critical of the entire Flohr-Mikenas Attack. At first glance. Black's opening play makes a somewhat curious impression, but anyone studying the position a little deeper will soon realize that things are not that simple. Black has not developed a single piece, yet he can hardly be said to be lagging too far behind in develop- ment, since White has developed only one piece himself. Besides, While's pawn on e5 is ex- posed to attack, not only by ...5fc6 but also by ...d6, when a pawn exchange on d6 may leave White with a nasty hole in his pawn-formation at d4. To prevent this. White will have to play d4 at some point, but when? The simplest solution is to play 5 d4 at once, but this has the drawback of White having to take back on d4 with the queen (5...cxd4 6 Qxd4). allowing Black to play 6...Nc6 with gain of tempo. Although this variation is pretty solid for White (he will simply reply 7 'S'e4), the popularity of the Flohr-Mikenas Attack is mainly due to a much sharper idea: 5 5)f3 Nc6 and only now 6 d4. Again, this looks very strange at first sight, for does this not simply 2 €x3 e6 3 Nf3 This position is a meeting point of three dif- ferent move-orders. It is of vital importance for

) 2)f3, for 1 c4 2Bf6 2 Nf3 and for 1 c4 Nf6 2 2)c3 e6 3 "Jf3. Black has four options. The first is the un- complicated 3...d5- Since White can hardly al- low his knight to be chased back by 4...d4. he has practically no choice but to play 4 d4 (with
4 e3 being a very modest, but theoretically pos-
sible alternative). This transposes to a Queen's Gambit Declined (sec page 17). Then there is 3...c5, a slightly more modest but equally solid move, with which Black is also bringing a central square under his direct control. This transposes to a variation of the Symmetrical English (sec page 2 16). A third possibility is to play 3...Bb4, some- times called the Nimzo-English. Black chooses the Nimzo-Indian game plan and challenges his opponent to find something better than 4 d4 (which would directly transpose). Substituting the Queen's Indian for the Nimzo, the same can be said about Black's fourth op lion: 3".b6. With this, the most popular move for almost half a century now, White wants to recapture on c3 as 'cleanly' as possible and does not mind in- vesting a considerable amount of time in this plan.
4 Rb3 is an obvious alternative, seemingly
more forcing than 4 Rc2, because 4..Bxc3 5 Rxc3 is unattractive for Black compared to the main 4 Rc2 line, where White needs the extra move a3. The drawback of 4 Rb3 is that after 4,..c5 5 a3 Jla5, the queen is less well placed on b3 than on c2. Nevertheless, this is a perfectly viable variation. Another important option is to stoically con- tinue developing the kingside, using the classi- cal flank opening scheme 4 g3. The main line here is 4...O-O 5 Bg2 d5, though the Queen's In- dian move 4...b6 is also quite popular. The late 1990s, however, saw the introduc- tion of a move of a wholly different calibre, if not from another planet: 4 g4 (D). Nimzo-English 3 ... Nb4(D) This has been played with great enthusiasm by many a top player and it shows how unpre- dictable and adventurous life is, even in the flank openings. 1 c4 and 1 <2Bf3 may look like slow moves, but there can be a lot of pent-up energy behind them. If 4...<2)xg4, White simply wins back the pawn with 5 Sgl , while against other moves the g5 advance will disrupt Black's 'normal' game plan.
4 ... O-O(0)
In the early days of the Nimzo-English, the 1960s and 1970s, 4...c5 5 a3 Jla5 was the main line, giving rise to a sori of Symmetrical English Just like the 'real' Nimzo-Indian (that would arise after 4 d4), this variation offers a wealth of different types of middlegame. It requires con- fidence, good positional judgement and a wide knowledge of opening theory. To begin with, White has to decide how to deal with a possible exchange on c3.

with the curious difference of a black bishop on a5, which you would normally expect to be at g7. Although this line has by no means been refuted, the preferred choice of modem players is the more typically Nimzo-Indian strategy of capturing on c3. (often in combination with either ...e5, ...c5 or both), and an immediate counter-thrust in the centre with ...d5. After, for instance, 7 g3 Bb7 8 Bg2 d5 9 cxd5 ?)xd5 10 Rc2 c5 Black has a solid position, having given up the bishop-pair in exchange for a firm grip on ihe centre. The al- ternative 7 b4 makes this strategy less attractive for Black, most notably in the variation 7...Ji.b7
8 Bb2 d5 9 cxd5. when 9...<2)xd5 is now strictly
prohibited on account of 10 Rxg7#! In this case, a plan based on ...d6 and ...e5, giving the bishop on b2 as little scope as possible, seems the most natural option. 2 2>c3 e6 3 Nf3 b6 3 ... b6 (D) This was a popular variation in the 1970s and 1980s. Black chooses the Queen's Indian model for his development. 4 d4 would be a di- rect transposition, but this is unlikely to worry the average 3...b6 player unduly. A more criti- cal test of 3...b6 is... 4 e4 Another option is the much quieter 4 g3, giv- ing ri se, after 4..,Bb7 5 Jlg2 ,Ne7 6 O-O O-O. to a position that is more often reached via other move-orders, in particular 1 Nf3 <2)f6 2 c4 b6 or 1 c4 Nf6 2 Nf3 b6. I have assigned it to 2 £tf3 b6 in this chapter (see page 247). Black may also seek a transposition to a Hedgehog Variation of the Symmetrical English with 4...c5 or ...c5 at a later stage. 4 ... ' ±b7 This position is closely related to the 4 Rc2 O-O variation of the Nimzo-Indian Defence and anyone desiring to unravel its secrets will have to be aware of the many transpositional possi- bilities. The immediate 7 d4 is a realistic op- tion, but many other moves, like 7 c3 Ji.b7 8 Ae2 for instance, emphatically keep the door to the Nimzo-Indian open as well. Other important moves are 7 g3 and 7 b4. Both moves leave Black the choice between a very flexible position, based on ...d6 and ..,<2hbd7

Unlike after 2...b6 3 e4 (see page 235), there is no need to be afraid of 5 e5. because there is no problem with 5...l2)e4 now. Generally speaking, one can say that the crit- ical test of 3...b6 is a plan consisting of main- taining the pawn on e4 (thus ruling out Black's usual 'Queen's Indian' control over e4) and then playing d4, creating a broad pawn-centre. But achieving such a plan is far from easy. White has to be constantly on his guard for pos- sible counterattacks in the centre with ...d5 and ...c5.

from potential danger. The critical line is 6 cxd5 exd5 7 e5 l2)e4 (or7...Nfd7), when Black has indeed created a stronghold in the centre, but he has also given his opponent a pawn on e5, which may generate potentially dangerous attacking chances against his kingside.
2 Nc3 g6
2 ... g6 (D) This is the move for someone who wants to play the King's Indian Defence. White has to make up his mind. 3 d4 is of course a direct transposition to 1 d4 theory, but it does leave it up to Black to choose between a King's Indian (3...Bg7) and a Griinfeld (3...d5). Rather more incisive is 3 e4, avoiding the Griinfeld and steering towards a King's Indian (3...d6 4 d4). But if White has a different varia- tion of the King's Indian in mind, or if he does not want a 1 d4 opening al all, these options are not particularly attractive. In that case White is likely to prefer 3 €)f3 or 3 g3. Although 3 £tf'3 is a perfectly valid option, it leads to a position that is far more often reached via 1 <Nf3 or 1 c4 '<hf6 2 <2tf3 g6 3 -Sic3, which is why I have decided to classify it as such (see page 245). By playing 3 g3 (D), White sticks to classi- cal flank strategy. As always, this gives the opponent almost to- tal freedom of choice. The position is literally crawling with transpositions, so some knowl- edge of the openings concerned is certainly This looks like a beginner's move. Not only does the bishop do nothing on d3 to support the vital advance d4, but it even blocks it' However, the idea is to play i.c2 and then d4. If White can execute this plan undisturbed, he will have a very healthy position with e4 firmly covered and his pieces harmoniously placed, with the threat of e5 constantly hanging over his oppo- nent's head. Black faces a fundamental decision. Lovers of the Hedgehog System will probably feel at home in the position after 5".d6 6 .S.c2 c5 7 d4 cxd4 8 Nxd4, but they must realize that White's attacking chances on the kingside are consider- ably enhanced by his bishop standing on c2 rather than its 'normal' square g2. An attempt to reach the same position with 5".c5 is slightly riskier, because it allows the aggressive 6 e5. Another idea is to strike back in the centre at once: 5...d5, but this strategy is also not free

useful. There is a wide range of transpositions (primarily to a King's Indian or a Griinfeld Defence, but there are also variations of the Reversed Sicilian or the Symmetrical English involved) for Black to choose from, but each time it is up to White whether to 'finalize' the transposition by playing d4. It is impossible to give a complete picture of these transpositions. I shall just name a few of the more important ones: if 3...d5 4 cxd5 -5)xd5 we have reached a position that we examine in the next section via 2...d5, after 3...c5 we find ourselves in a Symmetrical English and after
3..Bg7 4 3lg2 O-O White can either transpose
to a King's Indian immediately with 5 d4, or play the 'neutral' 5 '2Bf3, when it is again up to Black to choose between 5...d6 (and possibly 6 O-O e5 7 d3 3c6, transposing to a line of the Re- versed Sicilian; see page 224), 5...c5 and the Griinfeld-related 5...d5. 2 £sc3 d5 2 ... d5 (D) While 2...e6 is the move for lovers of Nimzo- and Queen's Indian variations and 2...g6 is the best choice for the King's Indian players, 2...d5 is the way to remain within reach of the Griin- feld Defence. It is true that after 2...g6, transpo- sitions to the Griinfeld are possible, but there is no guarantee that this will happen, because White may choose to play 3 e4, thus preventing ...d5 altogether. Of course there is no such thing as a 'guarantee' after 2...d5 either, but at least Black cannot be forced into a King's Indian ! By playing 2...d5, Black sets up a Griinfeld-related position. Eventually, it is always up to White to make it a real Griinfeld - by playing d4 - or not. 3 cxd5 After 3 d4, 3...g6 transposes to the starting position of the Griinfeld Defence. Black could also turn it into a Queen's Gambit, Declined, Slav or Accepted, with 3...e6, 3...c6 or 3...dxc4, respectively. 3 ... Qxd5
4 g3 (D)
By fianchettoing his king's bishop, White goes for a true flank opening. 4 d4 g6 trans- poses to the Griinfeld, as does 4 e4 Nxc3 5 bxc3 g6 6 d4. 4 (?)f3 g6 will be discussed in the section on 2 £rf3 g6 3 Nc3 d5 4 cxd5 4)xd5, later in this chapter (see page 245).

The immediate 7 Sbl is also a popular move. This introduces two rather tricky tactical points. One is that 7...O-O? is not only a clever idea to tempt White into 8 Bxb7?? fLxb7 9 Exb7 Rd51, attacking both rooks, but also a blunder: after 8 Sxb7! it is Black who has been tricked. The subtler and more sensible version of this idea is to play 7...Ohd7, when 8 i'.xb7? Jlxb7 9 Sxb7 Nb61 traps the rook. Another widely accepted plan of attack is the very direct 7 h4. All this does not mean that this is a bad vari- ation for Black. His position is intrinsically sound, but the resulting type of middlegame is different from a 'real' Griinfeld and this re- quires some adaptation. The alternative 5...?)b6 (D) is more cau- tious. The final decision in favour of a Griinfeld. Naturally, 4...e5 and 4...c5, transposing to the Reversed Sicilian and the Symmetrical Eng- lish respectively, are perfectly sound alterna- tives. 5 ±g2 In this position Black has two options that both fit well into his Griinfeld-oriented strat- egy: 5...4t)xc3 and 5..Ab6. After 5...Nxc3 6 bxc3 Jtg7 (D) we have reached a position where Black has made all the typical Griinfeld moves. White on the other hand has stubbornly refused to play that most typical of queen's pawn opening moves, namely d4 itself.

This variation provides a beautiful example of the essence of flank strategy. By keeping his pawns back. White gives his opponent no tar- gets for a counterattack. His plan is first to put maximum pressure on the enemy position from the flanks and only then throw in (if still needed) the infantry, preferably at a moment when Black is unable to strike back. This general idea often gives rise to some highly original play. For in- stance, a veritable 1 c4 player will not even dream of meekly playing 7 d4 in this position, transposing to an innocuous variation of the Griinfeld (7...c5). An approach like 7 kjf3 O-O 8 O-O c5 9 Sbl Nc6 10 ' a4 is much more difficult for Black to handle. While attacking Black's queenside. White is at the same time preparing a surprise attack against Black's king with Rh4 and Jth6 and he is looking for a favourable op- portunity to play d4. In this case a transposition to the Griinfeld with 6 d4 Ng7 7 Nf3 O-O 8 O-O (see page 137) is a fully acceptable option. But persisting in a pure flank strategy is equally realistic. The sharp 6 h4. for instance, is quite often played, as is the less drastic 6 5)f3 J_g7 7 O-O O-O 8 d3, when af- ter 8...5)>c6 White has an excellent plan in 9 jle3. followed by Wcl and Jlh6.

2...e6 in this position is to continue 3...d5, in the
spirit of the Queen's Gambit Declined. 2 f3 2 43f3 (D) This position is of vital importance for two reasons. In the first place, as I have elaborated before, there is a great difference between 2 '91c3 and 2 91f3 in the way both moves antici- pate Black's characteristic plans in this open- ing. How is While going to respond to a King's Indian set-up. to a Grunfeld, to a Nimzo- or Queen's Indian, etc.? Secondly, this position belongs to 1 4ff3 the- ory as much as to 1 c4. Many a would-be 1 c4 player lets himself be frightened by the daunt- ing prospect of having to face 1 c4 e5 and uses 1 51f3 as a side door. This avoids the Reversed Si- cilian and after 1 ...'9Bf6 2 c4 White has got what he wanted! Now, what are Black's options in this posi- tion? To begin with, there is of course 2...c5, with a transposition to the Symmetrical English. Then there is 2...c6, which usually transposes, either to a Slav Defence after 3 d4 d5 or 3 Nc3 d5 4 d4. or to a Rdti Opening after 3 g3 d5 (see page 251). The potentially independent variations start with 2...e6, 2...g6 and 2...b6, The queenside fianchetto is now much more solid than after 2 <22)c3, because White does not have 3 e4. Another difference from 2 <5Ac3 is that in this case 2...d5?! is not very well timed. After 3 cxd5 <$3xd5 4 d4 g6 5 e4 we have reached a po- sition that was mentioned in the chapter on the 3 g3 By playing this move, White turns 2 9)f3 into an independent variation. Naturally, 3 53c3 (see 2 <Nc3 c6 3 <2ff3) and 3 d4 arc perfectly sound alternatives.
3 b3 d5 4 Jib 2 is also not bad, but much
more experimental. Playing like this is leaving mainstream opening theory rather than follow- ing it. White will normally fianchetto his king's bishop at a later stage, but in some cases a scheme involving e3 and a bishop move along the fl-a6 diagonal is equally playable. This line is closely related to 1 <2)f3 d5 2 b3, an opening we shall be looking at in the next chapter. 3 ... d5 This is the classical approach. Black occu- pies the centre and accepts a possible transposi- tion to a Catalan.
244 FUNDAMENTAL CHESS OPENINGS
3...c5 is a Symmetrical English again. 3...b6
4 jLg2 Bb7 will be discussed under 2...b6. An adventurous variation on the latter theme is to play 3...a6 (D). Now, if White does not want to transpose to the Catalan Opening immediately with 4 d4. he has two well-established main lines: 4 .g2 and 4b3.
4 Jcg2 is often played with the idea of trans-
posing to the Catalan a few moves later, for in- stance after 4....Ne7 5 O-O O-O 6 d4. This avoids some variations, most notably the 4...dxc4 com- plex, thus narrowing Black's options. This is another example of White using a flank opening in effect to play a 1 d4 opening on his own terms, a phenomenon which runs like a common thread throughout 1 c4 and 1 4)f3 theory. The critical test of 4 Bg2 could be said to be 4...dxc4. If then 5 'S'ad-t- "?)bd7 6 Rxc4 c5, for instance, the opening struggle will revolve around the ques- tion: will Black find a comfortable way to de- velop his queen's bishop?
4 b3 avoids this problem. Black is given as
little opportunity for creating counterplay as possible. This usually leads to a rather slow build-up. Eruptions of violent action (if any) are not to be expected before the middlegame. Black is left free to develop his position as it pleases him. Classical plans are 4...Ji.e7 5 jLg2 O-O 6 O-O and now 6...c5 7 Bb2 $Jc6 or 6...b6 7 jLb2 jLb7. More cheeky (and more modern) is
4...a5. making the opponent worry about the
possible advance 5...a4. 2 $3f3 g6 2 ... g6 (D) This move introduces either a King's Indian or a Griinfeld set-up. As regards the latter, the The idea is to continue 4 Bg2 b5, not only creating a square at b7 for the light-squared bishop, but immediately starting hostilities on the queenside as well. Oleg Romanishin started pioneering this line around 1975 and a decade or so later it suddenly became all the rage. Al- though this looks risky ( and is obviously rather provocative), it is in fact remarkably solid. An attempt to win a pawn by 5 Nd4 c6 6 cxb5 axb5
7 Nxb5 would be dubious at best in any case,
since the white knight is in trouble after 7...d5, but with 7...cxb5 8 Ji,xa8 d5! trapping the bishop, White is clearly ill-advised to try' this. The main line runs 5 b3 Bb7 and now, for in- stance, 6 O-O c5 7 4hc3. A subtle, but very important point of 3...a6 is that the plausible 4 3hc3, to prevent 4...b5, is not as strong as it looks, because Black now- switches to 4...d5. With 5...d4 a serious threat, White would like to reply 5 d4. but this trans- poses to a somewhat problematic version of the Catalan Opening (5...dxc4). As a rule (though there are exceptions!) White's queen's knight should not be developed at c3 too early in this opening. This is the same problem that White has to deal with if he plays 2 A}c3 e6 3 g3 (see page 235). We now return to 3...d5 (D): This position is also relevant to the Red Open- ing, for instance via 1 "2 3 d5 2 c4 e6 3 s3 4)1'6.
1 c4 AND OTHER ENGLISH LINES 245
situation is exactly the opposite of 2 4)c3, where
2...d5 is the Griinfeld-oriented move, not 2...g6.
3 c3 This creates the possibility of 4 e4 and forces Black to lay his cards on the table. Anyone intending to meet the King's Indian or the Griinfeld with the g3 system will proba- bly prefer 3 g3. In that case the picture is simi- lar to the one presented by 2 Qc3 g6 3 g3 (see page 240): Black can go for a King's Indian set-up with ...d6 and ...e5. he has ...c5 with a possible transposition to the Symmetrical Eng- lish or he can play the Griinfeld move ...d5 at some point. In all of these cases it is up to White to decide whether (and if so, when) to play d4, which usually results in a transposition to a King's Indian or Griinfeld. 3 ... d5 (D) This is an invitation to a Griinfeld and theo- retically the most interesting move. If 3....g7.
4 e4 d6 5 d4 transposes to a King's Indian with-
out any subtleties. After 3...d5, White has a number of ways of refusing the invitation. After 3...d5, how realistic is it to try to find something better than (or at least as good as) 4 d4, with an immediate transposition to the Griinfeld? This is in fact a very difficult question. It is partly a matter of personal preferences (White has a few options of defining the middlegame in a very concrete way) and partly a matter of exact calculations, for there are a few variations that depend largely upon very precise evaluation. Al any rate, Black will have to be prepared for a great variety of possible types of play. 4 cxd5 Most variations start with this exchange of pawns, but 4 Ra4+ is another important test of the soundness of 3...d5. White makes an at- tempt to disorganize Black's position. First he provokes 4...Jld7, making it impossible for Black to meet 5 Rb3 with 5,..d4. Then, after
5...dxc4 6 Rxc4 Bg7, he has the energetic 7 e4,
intending to counter 7...O-O with 8 e5. Only then, after 8...'2je8 for instance. White finally plays 9 d4. In comparison with the Russian Variation of the Griinfeld Defence (see page 1 32), Black's position is now an unusually pas- sive one. A true Griinfeld devotee will probably try to find something better - something more active. Theory has not determined any 'best line' yet, but Black has been experimenting with 7...Jlc6 (instead of 7. ..O-O) and with 6...a6 (instead of 6...Jig7), intending to play a quick ...b5. 4 ...

g3 g6 5 Ag2), so he can calmly play 6...O-O, when after 7 O-O he has a choice of 7...c5, with a transposition to the Symmetrical English (see page 209), and 7...Nc6, when White can finally decide to turn it into a proper Griinfeld after all by playing 8 d4. 2 b6 Now 5 d4 is an 'honest' Griinfeld again. The many attempts to improve on this are of a varied nature. Sharpest (again) is the destabilizing 5 Qa4+. especially when after 5...Jld7 White continues
6 Qh4. If Black then retreats the knight by
6...£rf6, White again has 7 e4, while 6...5)xc3 7
dxc3 offers prospects of fast and aggressive de- velopment. Black will have to play with some accuracy here. Another major option for White is to con- tinue 5 e4. This transposes to a Griinfeld if, after
5...<2)xc3, White recaptures with the b-pawn (6
bxc3 Jlg7 7 d4), but most players who go for 5 e4 have something else in mind: 6 dxc3 xd 1 + 7 4>xdl (D). 2 ... b6 (D) w With this move Black makes it clear that he would like to transpose to a Queen's Indian De- fence, more so than if he plays 2...e6 3 Nc3 b6, which allows the sharp 4 e4 (see page 239). Af- ter 2...b6, there is in fact very little room for White to avoid a Queen's Indian. However, many 1 c4 and 1 Nf3 players are not trying to avoid this transposition completely; they are just trying to avoid certain variations of the Queen's Indian. 3 g3 White is hoping to reach the 4 g3 variation of the Queen's Indian without having to worry about the troublesome 4 g3 Aa6. In a similar way, White can try to reach the 4 a3 variation without the parallel line 4 a3 Jta6, by playing 3 4jc3 here. If Black refuses to co- operate (i.e. 3...jLb7 4 d4 e6 5 a3). he has little choice but to play 3...e6, which of course al- lows 4 e4 again. 3 ... -Bb7
3...c5 is an important alternative. I have clas-
sified this move as a line of the Symmetrical English (see page 220). White is working on the assumption that this queenless middlegame offers him slightly the better chances on account of his small lead in development. His king is likely to find ref- uge at c2. Much will depend, of course, on the quality of White's endgame technique and it is by no means certain that White does stand better, but the most important thing about this position is that many a Griinfeld player who was counting on a sharp opening battle will be disagreeably surprised by this sudden turn of events. Finally, 5 g3 is often played in this position. This quiet developing move introduces a typi- cal plan, which we have by now encountered in many different forms. After 5...Jlg7 6 Bg2 Black is not forced to withdraw his knight from d5 (as he is in case of 2 Nc3 d5 3 cxd5 Nxd5 4

There is, of course, no objection at all to playing 5 d4. but for those who are not worried about a transposition to the Symmetrical Eng- lish (which is available to Black at any moment just by playing ...c5) there is no need to rush with this advance. 5 ... Ne7 6 2)c3 O-O (D) 4 ,fi,g2(D) If White is already satisfied with what he has achieved (the elimination of ...jLa6). he could also play 4 d4 straightaway, with a view to 4...c6 5 .g2, transposing to a 4 g3 Jlb7 Queen's In- dian. However, he has to take the sharp reton
4...c5 5 d5 b5J? into account. So far. this has
hardly been tested. In this position it is not too late to play 7 d4, but, in a similar way as we have seen in the Hedgehog Variation (see page 219), White also has the chance of confronting his opponent with more complicated problems than this sim- ple transposition to a well-known variation of the Queen's Indian. By playing 7 Eel, While 'threatens' to play 8 e4 first and d4 afterwards. A logical reply to this idea is to play 7...d5. After 8 cxd5, 8...exd5 9 d4 leads to a type of position that is specific to the Queen's Indian Defence, comparable to the variation 4 g3 jit.b7 5 Ag2 Jle7 6 O-O O-O 7 <2)c3 d5 (see page 80). The al- ternative 8...<2)xd5 9 e4 <2)xc3 10 bxc3 c5 1 1 d4 is also quite playable. In fact, we have seen this very position before: in the 7 Sei variation against the Hedgehog (see page 219). And perhaps it is only fitting that we should end our investigation of the English Opening with a complicated maze of interconnected variations like this. Black chooses a purely Queen's Indian set- up. 4...c5 or 4...g6 5 O-O Jfg7 6 4k3 c5 trans- poses to the variation that he could already have chosen on move three (3...c5). Reti Opening
1 Qf3 (D) and other top grandmasters after him have used
his ideas and his opening. Now, in the early years of the 21st century, a world w'ithout 1 4ff3 seems unthinkable. Still, it is important to realize that this open- ing can be used in two different ways, the same as I outlined for 1 c4. The first one is to use 1 <2tf3 as the starting move of a pure flank strat- egy. no matter how Black reacts to it. The sec- ond is to use 1 "?)f3 as a side door to I d4. In this case White will try' to reach his favourite 1 d4 variations (or avoid those of his opponent!), de- pending on how Black reacts to 1 Qhf3 . Both in- terpretations of 1 4t)f.3 are perfectly legitimate and do not exclude each other. Most 1 5)f3 players will combine them, thus creating a tai- lor-made. highly personal 1 4)f3 repertoire. The classical reactions to 1 Nf3 are of course
1...115 and l...Sf6.
Many other moves are equally sound, but most of them are in effect an invitation to trans- pose to a different opening. I...c5, for instance, is a clear invitation to a Sicilian Defence (2 e4). Of course Black also has to lake 2 c4 into account, a transposition to the Symmetrical English. On the other hand. Black's choice makes it much harder for While to direct the game into a main-line 1 d4 opening system. And anyone playing (D) naturally ex- pects a transposition to the Dutch Defence, for which White only needs to play d4, now or later. But Black has to be aware of 2 e4. the Lisit- syn Gambit. This is an attempt to take advan- tage of the vulnerability of Black's kingside, an unavoidable consequence of l...f5. White is hoping for a blitzkrieg and indeed things can de- velop very' quickly in this position. After 2...fxe4 3 4)g5 "t)f6 4 d3! exd3 5 Jkxd3, Black is already staring a mating idea in the face: 6 Nxh7! Nxh7 7 J2.g6#! Fortunately, there is no need for Nowadays, it seems almost incomprehensi- ble that there ever was a time when this solid and natural opening move was not taken seri- ously at all. And yet this was the consensus view until Richard Reti (1889- 1929) was hugely successful with it in 1923 and 1924 and pub- lished several theoretical articles to support his views. Only then did 1 Nf3 manage slowly (and in the face of a great deal of resistance from conservative theoreticians) to emerge from the marshland of what was once called the 'Ir- regular Openings'. Little by little, Reti's ideas gained acceptance and his name began to be at- tached to Iris' opening. What Reti so brilliantly conceived was not just a certain move-order or a single variation, but an entire concept, the strategic concept of a Hank opening. Not only did he examine the con- sequences of 1 <2af3, he also reinterpreted the older 1 c4 in the light of his (then) revolutionary idea that one need not immediately start occupy- ing the centre squares from the first moves, but that it is possible to control them from the flank. Many of the positional ideas that we have seen in the three chapters on the English Opening were devised by him. Practically all world champions

w Black to self-destruct. Instead of 4...exd3, he has several more solid moves, like returning the pawn with 4...e3 or 4...e5, or on the previous move, 3...e5 4 d3 e3. There is also the sharp op- tion 3...d51? 4 d3 Rd6 5 dxe4 h6, if Black wishes for a more lively fight. However. White has a related option in 2 d3, intending to play e4 next move (e.g. 2...<2tf6 3 e4 fxe4 4 dxe4 €)xe4 5 jLd3 Nf6 6 Ng5 transposes to the dangerous line mentioned above). Black should probably decline this form of the gambit. As a more general point, Black must be care- ful in all these Dutch vs Reti/English lines that White cannot make an advantageous e4 ad- vance at a slightly later stage. Thus, a rather more subtle reaction to l...f5 is to play 2 g3, postponing a decision about d4 until Black has made his intentions clearer. If Black chooses a Stonewall set-up. it may be worthwhile to play d3 and e4 instead of d4, if only to annoy the op- ponent, who in a 'real' Stonewall (with White having played d4) has probably never faced an e4 breakthrough in his entire life. Stonewall players need to plan out their specific move- orders very carefully here. Parallel to the growing popularity of 1 d4 d6 (see page 190), l...d6 (D) has developed from an insipid opening move (with intentions un- known) to an assertive reaction to 1 4t)f3. Black challenges his opponent to prevent the 'threatened' 2...e5 by playing 2 d4. and in- deed this does seem to be the theoretically crit- ical reply. Players who prefer a pure flank opening will have to go for 2 c4 e5 3 c3, a transposition to the Reversed Sicilian (see page 222), or a King's Indian Attack: 2g3 e5 3 J.g2. Finally, 1...g6 (D) is a move to be reckoned with. Here too, White can stoically continue 2 c4 or 2 g3, but in this case it is really tempting to change tack and play 2 e4 or 2 d4, accepting the freely offered central territory. This must be considered the critical test of l...g6. Note that this is a significant difference between 1 c4 and 1 <21f3: King's Indian players can comfortably meet 1 c4 with 1...g6, but cannot do so after 1 Nf3 unless they are also happy playing the Modern Defence. We shall look at the position after 1 Nf3 g6 2 e4 J.g7 3 d4 in the section on 1 e4 g6 (see page 462). I...d5 1 ... d5 (D)
250 FUNDAMENTAL CHESS OPENINGS
The alternatives 2...e6, 2...c6 and 2...dxc4 are a little more cautious, though in their own way they also ask White the question: what is the point of your opening? Of these three moves I shall only discuss the latter two here, because 2...e6 will normally (i.e. after the 'normal' 3 g3 £jf6) transpose to a variation that we have already looked at in the previous chapter (1 c4 <$Qf6 2 5)f3 e6 3 g3 d5; see page 243). 3 d4 is of course a Queen's Gam- bit Declined (or a Catalan).

line was also (briefly) discussed in the previous chapter(via 1 c4<Nf6 2 12)f3d5?!;seepage243). I...d5 2 c4 d4 2 ... d4 (D) Just as the 'regular' Benoni is one of the most controversial defences to 1 d4, this line (which is in effect a Benoni Reversed) has always been as- sessed in strong, almost emotional terms. What is most remarkable perhaps, is that 'the books' have always been fairly sceptical about 2...d4, but in practice there are few players who have had the courage to play this line as White'. 2 d4 and 2 g3 are far more popular than 2 c4. After 2...d4, White has three rather different methods of play, all of which are easily recog- nizable as originating from the Benoni. To begin with, there is 3 e3, attacking Black's far-advanced d-pawn at once. The most impor- tant theoretical starting position of this line arises after 3...'2)c6 4 exd4 Nxd4 5 41xd4 Rxd4 6 ?)c3 e5 7 d3. White is aiming at a complete In the 1920s. a time when classical posi- tional dogma did not tolerate heretical views and the central squares had to be occupied by pawns, this was the self evident reason why 1 Nf3 was an unimportant move. After all, ac- cording to orthodox dogma. White now has to play 2 d4 to avoid a disadvantage. So why not simply play 1 d4 instead? It is chiefly thanks to Reti that the chess world saw the breakthrough in positional think- ing that has allowed the alternatives 2 c4 and 2 g3 to come to the fore. Even 2 b3 has become an accepted way of playing, mainly because of the efforts of Nimzowitsch. It is these three moves that we shall be look- ing at in this chapter, but it is interesting to note that - ironically - 2 d4 has recently become very popular again. Many of the modem gener- ation of 1 4t?>f3 players are satisfied with Black having committed himself to a Queen's Gambit by playing l...d5. A large part of 1 d4 theory has been side-stepped, so 1 $)f3 has done its job, and back to business. I...d5 2 c4

It is mainly thanks to this move that Reti and his fellow pioneers managed to get 1 *2hf3 going in the 1920s. Nevertheless, 2 c4 has remained a controversial move to this day. The critical re- ply is 2...d4, accepting the challenge to play a Benoni with colours reversed. This line has been alternately called good and bad ever since the days of Reti himself.

Of A W ' " A ;Wx w opening of the centre by 8 Jlc3 and 9 d4. The more ambitious 3...c5 is not all that popular, probably because players are worried about the unclear consequences of a Reversed Blumen- fcld Gambit: 4 b4. A second option is to surround the d4-pawn. by playing 3 b4 followed by 4 Jlb2. Black has various ways of defending his outpost; e.g., the solid 3...g6 4 Jib2 3kg7 or the sharp 3...f6 4 e3 e5 (intending 5 exd4 e41). The most flexible option is 3 g3. White starts by developing his light-squared bishop on g2 and keeps the options of playing either e3 or b4 open. This allows Black considerable freedom in choosing a scheme of development for his pieces. The most popular plan is to play 3...Nc6

In fact, by playing 2...c6 Black signals his inten- tion to play a Slav-related opening scheme any- way, whether White plays d4 or not, for he is preparing to play ...Bf5 or ...Bg4. 3 b3 More than 2...e6, 2...c6 urges White to do something about a possible ...dxc4, since an easy recapture by 'S'a4+ and Qxc4 is now out of the question. For this reason 3 b3 is safest and simplest. Nevertheless, 3 g3 is not a bad move. This is more aggressive than 3 b3, for if Black now takes on c4, White is counting on different ways to get his pawn back or he might even sacrifice the pawn and play for the attack. And if Black does not take on c4. White will still be free to play b3. A few example lines after 3 g3 a) 3...dxc4 4 Ng2 b5 5 a4 i.b7 6 b3 cxb3 7 Rxb3.

Correct is 5...c6 6 Jib2 ?)bd7 7 O-O Jfe7. In this posi- tion, the traditional Reti approach is to play 8 d3 and 9 3bbd2, but nowadays 8 d4 is a popular alternative. The plan is to play 9 Qbd2, 1 0 Se 1 and 1 1 e4, which would not be possible with the black bishop at f5. This modern variation shows that even in the Reti Opening, where the game often develops slowly and in rather ste- reotyped fashion, it is still possible to find room for a precise and subtle treatment of the opening. There are two main lines from this position:
4...Af5 and 4...Bg4.
A ...jLf5 build-up is called the Lasker or New York Variation, because this was first played by Lasker in the famous New York tour- nament of 1924, against no less an opponent than Reti himself. There are no forced or pre- ferred move-orders here, but a characteristic continuation would be 4...jLf5 5 Ag2 e6 6 O-O bd7 7 Ab2 Jle7 and now 8 d3 h6 (to be able to retreat the bishop safely to h7) 9 Qbd2 O-O
10 a3 a5 (to stop b4) 1 1 Qc2. White has made a
central break with e4 a realistic prospect, but he is equally ready to support the b4 advance and increase the pressure along the al-h8 diagonal with moves like Ac3 and Rb2. Black on the other hand has a solid position without any weaknesses. This variation often starts with a lot of manoeuvring before unravelling (if at all) into a concrete fight. Patience is a virtue here. The alternative ...Bg4, introduced in 1925 by Capablanca, anticipates a possible d3 and I...d5 2 c4 dxc4 2 ... dxc4 (D) This is the natural choice of the Queen's Gambit Accepted player. Black resolves the central tension in an uncomplicated way. In most cases, the idea is not so much to keep the extra pawn, but to achieve maximum flexibility. Black will adapt his plan of development to the way in which White regains the pawn. The most direct way of doing so is to play 3 'S'a4+. If then 3... d7, the most popular move is 4 g3.

During the 1950s. when the King's Indian Defence against 1 d4 rose to great heights, 1 Nf3 in combination with 2 g3 became extremely popular as well. It was played by the strongest players of that time: Botvinnik, Smyslov, Pe- trosian and - a decade later - Bobby Fischer all were successful with this opening scheme. k A A kkkk

3 Ba3 is equally plausible. This move com-
bines recapturing the pawn with manoeuvring a knight to c4, where it will assume control over e5. Black has many plans here, the most assertive being 3...c5 4 Nxc4 4hc6. with per- haps ...f6 and ...e5 to follow. The more re- served 3...Nf6 4 <R3x04 g6 also makes a very natural impression.
3 e3 often transposes to the Queen's Gambit
Accepted; e.g.. 3...<2)f6 4 Bxc4 e6 5 d4. An at- tempt to maintain the extra pawn with 3...b5 will fail to 4 a4. After 4...c6 5 axb5 cxb5 the characteristic break 6 b3!? wins back the pawn and yields White the initiative. I...d5 2g3 The reason why 2 g3 may look a little slow is that Black is left completely free to develop as he sees fit. He can really do as he pleases. But when studied more deeply, the situation is not all that easy for Black, since he has to take three different plans for White into account: c4. d4 and d3 followed by e4. In some cases White will even fianchetto his queen's bishop first, be- fore making a choice. This means that for the time being Black does not have a clue as to his opponent's intentions, a situation that may well get on his nerves. Now, what are the normal moves in this po- sition where everything is possible? Without discussing every single move individually, we can distinguish four different strategies for Black. The most assertive option must be to play
2...c5. As if colours really have been switched.
Black assumes the role of a 1 d4 player, prepar- ing to play 3...Nc6 and 4...e5. The neutral developing move 2...Qf6 is a major alternative. Black keeps (almost) all op- tions open, but after 3 Bg2 he will have to show his hand after all.
2 g3 (D)
For most people who are familiar with 1 d4 or 1 e4 theory only, and who perhaps just leaf through these chapters on the flank openings, this move may come as a shock. If 1 4)f3 d5 2 c4 is still vaguely acceptable because of the di- rect attack against d5, 2 g3 must look like the ultimate bore. No action at all! Well, in fact this is a very narrow view which does not do justice to 2 g3. White's opening plan is not intended to avoid a fight. Actually. 2 c4 and 2 g3 are really very similar and Reti used both moves with the same idea in mind. 2 g3 is not slower, it is more flexible than 2 c4. De- pending on how Black reacts to 2 g3, White can decide to play c4 after all (which is what Reti
254 FUNDAMENTAL CHESS OPENINGS
2...'2)c6 is based on a different idea and this
move is far less complex than the previous two. Black is looking for clarity. By introducing the possibility of playing 3...e5 he forces White to make a decision. The same can be said about 2...g6. Does White, after 3 Bg2 ,g7, allow 4...e5 or not? And if not, will he choose a plan based on c4 or d4? less assertive ways, that we shall be looking at later in this chapter.
4 c4 d4 transposes to a position that can also
be reached via 2 c4 d4. Alternatives for Black are 4... 3f6 5 cxd5 5fxd5, transposing to a line of the Symmetrical English (see page 220). and 4,..e6 5 cxd5 exd5 6 d4, transposing to the Tarrasch Defence (see page 12). We now return to 4 d4 (N): l...d5 2 g3 c5 2 ... c5
3 Jlg2 2)c6 (D)
The slightly more cautious 3...Nf6 will be discussed under the heading 2...$)f6. On the face of it. Black now has the same wide range of possibilities that White has in the starting position of the Griinfeld proper, but a closer examination reveals that he had better be careful. It is precisely in a sharp opening like this, that White's extra move (Jtg2) is a telling factor. If 4...cxd4 5 QJxd4 e5 6 Nxc6 bxc6 7 c4, for instance. Black is already in some trouble.
4...4T6 5 O-O e6 (or 4...e6 5 O-O <2)f6) is
more cautious. Following 6 c4. this transposes to a line of the Catalan Opening after 6...dxc4 (see page 25) or to the Tarrasch Defence after
6...dle7 7 cxd5 exd5 (see page 13).
1...d5 2 g3 Nf6
2 ... Qf6
3 Ng2 (D)
In this position, which in practice often arises after 1 2)f3 <2)f6 2 g3 d5 3 Ng2, Black has to choose a game plan. Naturally, it is still quite possible to play the assertive 3...c5. After the plausible continua- tion 4 O-O ?lc6 White then faces the same choice as after 2...c5 3 Bg2 4Tc6. But precisely After 3...#)c6 the moment of truth has come. What is White going to do about 4...e5? 4 d4 This move, which in effect creates a Re- versed Griinfeld, comes naturally to a modem player, especially if he knows something about
1 d4 theory. Ultimately though, the choice is a
matter of taste.
4 O-O e5 5 d3 is a Reversed King's Indian,
in a version that is now regarded as relatively favourable for Black. Of course, a true lover of this opening scheme will not object to (and probably not even agree with) this judgement and in fact this was a popular line in the 1950s and 1960s. But in recent years, many players have become a little more fastidious, preferring to reserve the Reversed King's Indian for situa- tions where Black has developed in the rather
RETI OPENING 255
because of the Griinfeld-inspired 5 d4, many players prefer to delay ...Nc6 and play 4...g6 instead. If then 5 d4 cxd4 6 Nxd4 Bg7, we have the g3 system against the Griinfeld (with colours reversed), where White lacks the obvi- ous target for an immediate attack: without a knight on c6, "2)xc6 followed by c4 is not possi- ble. If 5 c4, Black (again) has a choice between the ambitious 5...d4 and the quiet 5...jLg7. The King's Indian plan (5 d3 Bg7 6 <2>bd2. followed by 7 e4) is perhaps slightly more inci- sive in this case than after 2,..c5 3 ,Ng2 Nc6. White's extra move (extra compared to the 'real' King's Indian) may well carry some ex- tra weight in the dynamic type of play that characterizes the Fianchetto Variation. The same scheme of development may be achieved with 3...g6, Black allows his opponent greater freedom in choosing an appropriate d4 plan (in fact he is even opening the door to a possible transposition to the Griinfeld Defence with 4 d4 J.g7 5 c4), but he is also reserving for himself the option of a plan without ...c5. If 4 O-O Bg7 5 d3 O-O 6 Qbd2, for instance, Black may well do without ...c5 and play 6...Nc6 7 e4 e5 instead. Similar considerations apply to 3...e6 (D). Every player behind the black pieces will make his choice in this opening on the basis of the contents of his entire personal opening repertoire. For someone who likes to play the Griinfeld against 1 d4, the move 3...g6 will probably come naturally, but someone who pre- fers the Queen's Gambit Declined will think of
3...e6 first, especially because a transposition to
the Catalan with 4 O-O fLe7 5 d4 O-O 6 c4 is un- likely to worry him. But an important criterion for determining the value of 3...e6 is the King's Indian option, for this is one of those situations where the King's Indian Attack gains in strength. After 4 O-O jLc7 5 d3 and now, for instance, 5...O-O 6 43bd2 c5 7 e4 (D) the e5 advance is looming darkly over Black's position. The resulting spatial advantage for While on the kingside may easily lead to a dangerous sit- uation for the black king. In many cases White can even afford almost to neglect whatever is happening on the queenside and concentrate his forces entirely on the opposite wing. A char- acteristic (though by no means forced) con- tinuation is 7...'Nc6 8 2el b5 9 e5 Nd7 10 Nfl a5 1 1 h4b4 12 )1112. While Black is mov- ing his army forward on the queenside. White is
256 FUNDAMENTAL CHESS OPENINGS
preparing to blow a few holes in Black's king- side defences, for instance by playing *?3g4 and h5-h6 or Jlf4 in combination with Ng5 and Rh5. The diagrammed position was in fact a very fashionable and hotly debated one in the 1960s. It is also a remarkable crossroads between 1 W3 theory and 1 e4, for it belongs equally to the R£ti Opening, the French Defence (1 e4 e6
2 d3 d5 3 Nd2, etc.) and the Sicilian (1 e4 c5 2
<Sf3 e6 3 d3 d5 4 Nbd2, etc.). An entirely different plan for Black is to play or 3...c6 4 O-O Bf5, analogous to the Lasker Variation (2 c4 c6 3 b3 <R3f6 4 g3 .f'5). The decision on whether to preface ...Af5 with ...c6 depends on how Black evaluates a possible c4. Is he afraid of 3..Bf5 4 c4 c6 5 cxd5 cxd5 6 Rb3 (see page 252), for instance? If not (or if he is putting his trust in 4...e6 instead of 4...c6), he might prefer 3...Jlf5 and perhaps save a tempo (,..c6) if White does not play 4 c4. Un- fortunately, even though this is quite a popular variation, theory does not seem to give a clear answer to these questions. Both sides will have to rely on their own judgement. But a major difference from the 2 c4 lines is that White still has the King's Indian option. If, for example, 3...c6 4 O-O Jtf5, then 5 d3 e6 6 <53bd2 h6 7 Qel (this is a rather more effective way of preparing e4 than the perhaps more ob- vious 7 2el, for after 7 Sei ate7 the intended 8 e4? will simply lose a pawn to 8...dxe4 9 dxe4

point of an exciting and double-edged varia- tion. It is of course useful for White to have gained a tempo by attacking the black bishop on f5. On the other hand, the bishop is now an important defender of the black king. Another idea is to play 5 b3 e6 6 Jcb2 first and start hos- tilities in the centre afterwards. If Blac k is thinking of playing along the lines of Capablanca's method (2 c4 c6 3 b3 52)f6 4 g3 jLg4) with 3...jLg4 or 3...c6 4 O-O Jtg4, he has to come to terms with the same problems. 4 c4 is the critical reply to the immediate 3...Xg4 and if he prefers 3...c6 4 O-O jlg4, then 5 b3 Nbd7 6 Bb2 e6 7 d3 and 5 d3 'Sbd? 6 Nbd2, followed by 7 e4, are major tests of Black's opening play. I...d5 2 g3 5jc6 2 ... Nc6 (D) More than anything else, this move is an in- vitation to the Chigorin Defence to the Queen's Gambit (3 d4; see page 52). If White does not care for this transposition, he has a choice of 3 Bg2 e5 4 d3, which I shall treat as a variation of
1 g3 in the next chapter, and 3 c4, giving Black
the option of playing a Benoni with colours re- versed again (3...d4; see 2 c4 d4). I...d5 2 g3 g6 2 ... g6 3 i.g2 i.g7 (D) Again, White has to make a decision as to how to deal with ...c5. If he plays 4 d4, then a

these brothers in arms, 2 b3 has always re- mained an outsider, a non- member, an avant- garde opening pur sang. However, this does not mean that the cor- rectness of 2 b3 is in any sort of doubt; on the contrary', 2 c4 is much more controversial (be- cause of the possible reply 2...d4) than 2 b3. The difference between 2 c4 and 2 g3 on the one hand and 2 b3 on the other, is that the for- mer are very flexible moves, that combine well with a 1 d4 repertoire, while 2 b3 is based on one scheme of development only and is a pure flank opening. This implies that the mod- ern 2 c4 and 2 g3 player requires a certain un- derstanding of possible transpositions to (and knowledge of) other openings. No such theoret- ical baggage is necessary for the 2 b3 player. There is plenty of scope for creativity here. Such variations as there are in this opening, are not too clearly-defined and are constantly in a state of flux. Which then, are these ill-defined variations? In the first place the assertive 2...c5 must be mentioned, a move that clearly signals Black's attitude: "if you are not prepared to occupy the centre, I shall''. Equally sound and a little more flexible is
2...Nf6.
2...f6 is an alternative that has never become
really popular. Though logical enough in itself, this move is a bit one-dimensional and it is too easy for White to stop 3...e5 by playing 3 d4. As we are about to see though, the idea of occupy- ing the centre with ...f6 and ...e5 is a not uncom- mon theme in this opening.
1...d5 2 b3 c5
2 ... c5 (D) 3 e3 The unsuspecting 3 Ab2 runs into 3...f6!, when all of a sudden ...e5 really is unstoppable, because 4 d4 is now met by 4...cxd4 and 5...e5. The emergency measure 4 e3 e5 5 d4 is no great success either: after 5...cxd4 6 exd4 e4 Black can be satisfied. 3 ... 2Bf6 Now 3...f6 would again be met by 4 d4, when ...e5 is prevented. transposition to the g3 system against the Griin- feld, 4...4)f6 5 c4, is not far away (see page 136). If he plays 4 O-O, allowing 4...e5, then after 5 d3 we find ourselves in one of those shadowy versions of the King's Indian Attack, where theory has little or no access. While's position is perfectly sound, of course, but so is Black's. There are almost no variations or even theoreti- cal guidelines to be distinguished here. A third option is to play 4 c4. when, as al- ways in a situation like this, 4...d4 is the critical reply. I...d5 2 b3
2 b3 (D)
This move came to the fore in the 1920s as an alternative to a classical (central) opening strategy, together with 2 c4 and 2 g3. But unlike
258 FUNDAMENTAL CHESS OPENINGS
2 b3 in the 1920s. If Black is not careful he may
easily find himself under severe pressure. With moves like f4 and 2f3-g3 coming up, the black king might be starting to feel the heat very soon.
4...e6 is a little more cautious, preparing to
meet 5 Jlb5+ with 5... .d7 and 5 4)e5 with
5...Nbd7. This makes it harder for White to ini-
tiate an attack on the kingside, which is why most players switch to another plan here, viz. 5 c4 or 5 d4 and a direct confrontation in the cen- tre. Analogous to the g3 system against the Queen's Indian Defence. 4...g6 also looks quite healthy, yet this move is strangely unpopular in practice. Perhaps potential 4...g6 players just do not like being unable to recapture immedi- ately on d5 in case of 5 c4 Jkg7 6 cxd5. Any- way, we are so deeply into uncharted territory here, that theory simply stops asking questions, let alone providing answers.
3...Nf6 in effect creates a Queen's Indian
Reversed, although that name fell out of use long ago. But the crucial problem of the open- ing 1 d4 £}f6 2 c4 e6 remains the same: does Black want to play ...'53c6, allowing his knight to be pinned by Jlb5. or not? And if yes, what is the best moment for doing so? Some players prefer 3...a6 in order to 'safe- guard" their knight on c6, while others play
3...Nc6, in order to meet 4 Bb5 very' subtly
with 4...e6, followed by 5...Ote7. The truly la- conic, however, play ...%Ac6 and ...lR3f6 without worrying about move-order or any such subtle- ties. 4 i.b2 (D) I...d5 2 b3 £rf6 2 ... 2>f6
3 Ab2 (D)
Black now has a large number of alterna- tives to 3...c5 (which after 4 e3 would take us back to the 2...c5 line). 3...e6 and 3...g6 pro- duce roughly the same type of play as when combined with 2...c5. Black could also con- sider 3...aif5 and 3...Jig4. two moves that have earned a solid reputation aeainst 2 c4 and 2g3. If now 4...£}c6, pinning the knight with 5 Jcb5 is certainly critical. A plausible continua- tion then is 5...Bd7 6 O-O c6 7 d3 J.e7 8 Nbd2 O-O 9 Bxc6 Ji.xc6 10 <53e5. This position was a favourite of Nimzowitsch, the great pioneer of
RF.TI OPENING 259
A major difference between these bishop moves is that 3..Bf5 allows White to switch to a 2 g3 line by playing 4 g3. This would be tricky after 3...Bg4, since 4 g3 would then be inviting Black to take on f3, which may not be a refuta- tion of 4 g3. hut it does create a totally different type of play from what White was probably looking for. At any rate, 4 e3 is the much more common reply to 3... .g4, with 4...53bd7 5 Be2 e6 6 c4 a thematic follow-up. This variation is considered one of Black's most solid replies to 2 b3. Unlike the lines 3...c6 or 2...c5 3 e3 5Bf6 4 Bb2 e6, where Black postpones development of his light-squared bishop. Black now enjoys easy and sound development for all of Iris pieces. At the same time White is given just a mini- mum of leeway to implement his flank strategy. 1 ... 21f6 (D) 2 g3
2 c4 is of course a major alternative and in
fact the most popular move in this position. I have included this in the previous chapter as it is really a variation of the English (1 c4 2 5Jf3). Many players who are afraid of opening
1 c4 because of 1 ...e5, but who do want to play
a flank opening, go for 1 5Jf3 531'6 2 c4 instead. In this move-order, some lines of the English Opening are not available to White, since he has committed himself to an early 5jf3, but this need not be a problem.
2 b3 is by no means bad, but has less inde-
pendent significance here than after l...d5. As an alternative to 2...d5 (which transposes to 1 4bf3 d5 2 b3 <2jf6) Black has the King's Indian- oriented 2...g6 and 2...d6. intending to play
3...c5. After 2...g6 3 Bb2 Bg7 4 g3 we reach a
variation that I shall discuss via 2 g3 and, strangely enough, 2...d6 3 d4 g6 4 Bb2 itg7 5 g3 transposes to the very same line! We now return to 2 g3 (D): When choosing his first move, Black always has to calculate on 1 <23f3 being no more than a feint. By continuing 2 d4. White could turn the opening into a queen's pawn opening against any possible reply, except l...c5, but then of course Black has to be prepared for a Sicilian Defence in case of 2 e4. Just like Black makes it clear that he has no objections against a Queen's Gambit by playing 1...d5, he keeps ac- cess to that other major group of 1 d4 openings by playing 1...5ff6. If White now plays 2 d4, Black is free to choose any 1 d4 531'6 opening he likes. Most of the many possible moves in this po- sition lead to variations we have already seen via a different move-order. And even if there is no immediate transposition, the well-known paths are never far away.
2...d5 is the first move to be considered. 1
have treated this position as part of the l...d5 complex, but the present move-order, 1 53f3 53f6 2 g3 d5, is in fact an important one, be- cause many players do not want to play l...d5 because of the possible transposition to the Queen's Gambit with 2 d4. By playing 1...5Jf6
260 FUNDAMENTAL CHESS OPENINGS
2 g3 and only now 2...d5, they do not have to
worry about this, since 3 d4 would now result in a fairly innocuous sideline of the Queen's Pawn Game (see page 52). All other moves leave White free to switch to the English or to a 1 d4 opening by playing 3 c4 or 3 d4. The important thing here is to investi- gate possible alternatives to such a transposition. The most popular move in this category is probably 2...g6 (D). English or the Queen's Indian with a quick c4 and/or d4, he has the option of playing the King's Indian Attack: 3 JaLg2 .S,b7 4 O-O and now, for instance. 4...e6 5 d3. Most players will then put an obstacle in White's way of playing
6 e4 by choosing 5...d5.
Another good move is 2...c5, but this is ex- tremely likely to result in a transposition; e.g., 3 c4 (Symmetrical English) or 3 ii.g2 Nc6 4 O-O e5 5 d3 d5 (see page 254). Apart from all these transpositions (or at- tempts at transposition) there is one move for Black to give the opening a face of its own:
2...b5 (D), the Spassky Variation.
Now, if both players persist in their refusal to advance their d- and c-pawns more than a sin- gle square, a symmetrical continuation like 3 .'*.g2 Ag7 4 O-O O-O 5 d3 d6 6 e4 e5 might re- sult. Both players are playing the King's In- dian ! In fact, many players prefer to break the symmetry at the very last moment by choosing
6...c5 instead of 6...e5. Now the opening looks
more like a Sicilian Defence. For those who prefer to stay closer to the world of 1 d4, but do not want a direct transpo- sition to the main lines with 3 d4, there is the al- ternative 3 b3 Bg7 4 Jib2 O-O 5 Jlg2. The idea is to meet 5...d6 with 6 d4, making the central advance ...e5 more difficult to achieve than in the 'regular' g3 system in the King's Indian De- fence. The result is a variation that can also be reached via 1 d4 ?jf6 2 Nf3 g6 3 g3 &gl 4 jLg2 O-O 5 O-O d6 6 b3 (see page 164).
2...b6 has an equally good reputation. Again,
if White does not care for a transposition to the We have seen this idea of an 'extended' fian- chetto before, viz. in the variation 1 d4 Bf6 2 £rf3 e6 3 g3 b5 (see page 168). Black is in ef- fect playing an aggressive version of the 2...b6 variation. Now that White has played g3, he will need an extremely good reason not to de- velop his bishop to g2, so Black does not need to worry so much about a frontal attack against his pawn on b5 with e3 or even e4. Just like in the 2...b6 line, Black will have to make up his mind after 3 Jig2 Bb7 4 O-O e6 5 d3 whether he is going to allow 6 e4 (and simply develop with 5,..d6 6 e4 ±e7 for instance) or whether he will accept the challenge to a fight for the centre with 5...d5. In both cases ...b5 will give Black more elbow room on the queenside than he would have had after 2...b6. Other Flank Openings To round off this section on the flank openings, we shall now take a brief look at what used to be called the 'Irregular Openings': everything other than 1 c4, 1 d4, 1 c4 and 1 <5Bf3. Some of these openings deserve better than to be bundled into a single chapter like this, for the quality and the nature of the openings in this chapter vary enormously. 1 g3 in particular is just marginally more 'irregular' than 1 £}f3. These two moves could just as easily have been treated in the same chapter. So a word of apology is due here, but in order to present all openings more or less in propor- tion to their relative importance (after all, the amount of theory involved in 'the big four' is immeasurably greater) I have decided that a single chapter for 'the rest' will have to do. There are no fewer than twenty legal open- ing moves for White to choose from. All of them have been given a name at some lime or another, but it would be a mistake to think that this implies they are all important. For behind the facade of a name, some of these 'openings' consist of a small but well maintained and re- spectable building, but others are no more than a ramshackle cottage, and behind some of the names there is just nothing at all. Now, what does this all mean? As 1 have already said, 1 g3 ties in very neatly with the previous chapters. To a somewhat lesser degree, the same goes for 1 b3. This move introduces a scheme of de- velopment that we know from the Reti Opening. If l...f5 is an acceptable reply to 1 d4, then surely 1 f4 must be an acceptable move as well. This is called the Bird Opening. Finally, although it is a rare move in top- level tournaments, 1 Nc3 (D) is also accepted as a reasonable way of starting the opening bat- tle. This is an opening of many names, but be- ing Dutch I prefer the relatively new name Van Geet Opening. These four moves will form the bulk of the contents of this chapter. The remaining twelve possible first moves can be roughly divided into three categories. To begin with, there are moves like 1 e3 (Van 't Kruys Opening) and 1 d3 (Mieses Opening), which are of course fully playable, but lack the necessary strategic backbone to really worry' Black. White is fully entitled to like 1 e3 c5 2 d4, for instance, but a transposition to the Exchange Variation of the French Defence (2...exd4 3 exd4 d5; see page 349) is a meagre result in the eye of a theoretician (and of most practitioners too). There is also nothing wrong with 2 c4 (in- stead of 2 d4), yet the greatest merit of this move is undoubtedly that it may suggest ideas of trying 1 c4 on another occasion. Then there are those moves with which White really tries to shoot himself in the foot, like 1 f3 or 1 g4. Out of loyalty to those unfortunates who have occasionally indulged in these strange moves in their youth, I shall not even give you the names of these 'openings'. Finally, there is one move that maintains a perfect balance between the extremes of te- diousness and foolishness: 1 b4 (D). This very provocative opening was first named after Englisch (1851-97), then after
262 FUNDAMENTAL CHESS OPENINGS
opening move quite often. In fact several older books name 1 g3 after him. It was only when 1 $If3 turned out to be the more important of the two, that his name became firmly attached to that move. Just like it could be argued that 1 <2)f3 and 1 c4 are more flexible than 1 e4 and 1 d4, and that 1 4Tf3 d5 2 g3 is more flexible again than 1 4lf3 d5 2 c4, it is also not unreasonable to state that this thinking in terms of flexibility reaches its peak in 1 g3. White develops his bishop on g2, but otherwise he preserves all options for a fu- ture game plan. Of course, the downside of this attitude is that Black is given exactly the same freedom. Nevertheless, 1 g3 is a move that has to be taken seriously and which has been adopted by many a top player. One thing about 1 g3 that makes this move rather special is that it can be played with widely varying intentions. It may be played to create new and original situations, drawing the oppo- nent out of his comfort zone of well-known openings and into the unknown: the art of un- settling the opponent. This was. for instance, how Bent Larsen used 1 g3 around 1960, and very successfully too (although it might be added that he achieved much the same effect with almost every opening he played!). But 1 g3 may equally well be the starting point of very traditional variations from the English or Reti Opening, or at least lead to completely 'normal' positions. This interpreta- tion of 1 g3 is more modest, but in the hands of somebody who knows his way around the flank openings, it can be just as effective. Finally, it must be remembered that 1 g3 can also come across as a provocation, thus raising great psychological tension right from the start. Black is challenged to occupy the centre as if he were White. The idea of course, is to hit back at the right moment, hoping that the extra tempo will make a difference after all. 1 ... e5 If Black intends to accept the challenge, ei- ther this move or l...d5 is the obvious choice. In determining which of these two moves is better, it is important to realize that White could still prevent the formation of a classical central for- mation with pawns on e5 and d5, by answering Sokolsky (1908-69), but ever since Tartakower invented the name Orang Utan Opening for it, there have been few players willing to have their name attached to this move. Black has a wide choice of possible re- sponses. but in so far as we can talk of a theoret- ical discussion in this opening, it concentrates on the position after 1 ...e5 2 Bb2. Should Black now play a solid move like 2...d6 or 2...f6, or should he simply develop his pieces quickly and easily with 2...Jcxb4 3 Bxe5 <2}f6? Ig3
1 g3 (D)
At the start of the chapter on the Reti Open- ing. I have already paid tribute to the pioneering work of Richard Reti for 1 <$3f3 in particular and for the concept of a flank opening in general. This concept includes 1 g3, and Reti played this

1...e5 with 2 c4 (which is a Reversed Sicilian)
and l...d5 with 2 (which is a Red). Other first moves too, always offer White a chance to switch to another opening. After l...c5 2 .&.g2 4dc6, for instance, 3 e4 produces a Si- cilian, while 3 c4 is a Symmetrical English. Lovers of the Dutch Defence will have to de- cide whether, after a possible set-up with 2 ,g2 g6 3 d3, followed by e4, is a nuisance. Nor is it self-evident that Black can reach a King's Indian Defence, for after l...g6 2 J.g2 Ng7 or l...Nf<" 2 Ng2 g6 White can avoid this opening by playing 3 e4. This creates a type of position which is similar to the Pirc Defence and might even transpose, for instance after
3...d6 4 d4 Jcg7 5 43c3 (see page 459).
2 jtg2 d5 (D) 1 b3
1 b3 (E>)
This seemingly modest move strikes a bal- ance between the provocative 1 b4 and the solid 1 d5 2 b3 (see page 257). It was in fact first introduced alongside J Nf3 d5 2 b3 by Nimzowitsch, who analysed, played and propagated both lines during the 1920s and 1 930s. After him it was mainly Bent Larsen who ventured 1 b.3 in the days when he was one of the strongest players in the world, the 1960s. Both these great players and pioneers have had their names attached to 1 b3. Indeed, the name Nimzowitsch-Larsen Attack has been widely used. Larsen himself jokingly called 1 b3 the Baby Orang Utan, thus not only showing a sense of humour but also mak- ing it clear that he saw 1 b3 and 1 b4 as being closely related. A comparison with 1 *22)13 d5 2 b3 is also of interest. From a classical viewpoint, one would be inclined to think 1 must be the more logical move, because this stops Black from playing l...e5. But looking at the theory and the practical evidence of 1 b3, one can only con- clude that it is precisely because White has so many ways of attacking a black pawn on e5 that In this position Bent Larsen used to harass his opponents with 3 2)f3. After 3...e4 4 -%jd4 a kind of Alekhine Defence (1 e4 <2Bf6) with colours reversed arises, while 3...<2)c6 4 d3 is a Pirc reversed. Instead of the somewhat conven- tional 4 d3, however, Larsen went as far as to play 4 O-O, again provoking 4...e4, which now forces the reply 5 •Ziel. The more popular choice is to play 3 d3. This prevents a possible ...e4 (thus preparing

fence is reached (see page 457), with colours reversed and an extra tempo for White. White's most important options are 6 c3 (which intro- duces the possibility of playing b4) and 6 Bg5
264 FUNDAMENTAL CHESS OPENINGS
1 b3 is a popular opening move. So it is the
'logical' drawback of I b3 (the allowing of
1...e5) that seems to be its greatest attraction!
1 ... e5 Black is completely free in his choice of opening scheme, but he has to be aware of a few possible transpositions. A King's Indian set-up. for instance, 1...4t3f6 2 jfc.b2 g6, allows 3 e4, which gives the game rather a 1 e4 look. And if
1...d5 2 Ji.b2 4bf6, White not only has 3 £tf3
(which transposes to 1 £rf3 d5 2 b3), but also 3 e3 followed by f4, which is a Bird Opening.
2 Jt.b2 "3c6 (D)
After 1 b4 e5 2 J.b2 this would run into 3 b5, but in this position there is no objection to this robust developing move and it is in fact Black's most popular choice here. Still, the alternative
2...d6 is also perfectly sound. Black renounces
any intentions of playing ...d5 and follows a King's Indian scheme of development. Roughly speaking, White then has two possible plans. The characteristic flank strategy is to play 3 g3 <2ff6 4 Bg2 g6 5 c4, creating a kind of Reversed Sicilian. The more direct approach is to chal- lenge Black's domination of the centre by play- ing 3 d4, or something like 3 c3 4 c4 g6 5 ?3f3 Ng7 6 d4. White remains within the relatively safe bounds of the Reversed Sicilian (that is to say: c4 and ...e5 have been played - there is no question of an actual transposition here). Nevertheless, this too is a controversial variation, the critical line being 4 e3 d5 5 cxd5 Nxd5. 3 ... dS Taking up the challenge. Of course there is nothing wrong with a move like 3...Nf6 either. 4 jk.b5 can then be met by 4...d6, so Black is effec- tively following the same plan as with 2...d6. A possible continuation would be 5 53e2, followed by d4 or f4, thus starting an attack against e5.
4 Ab5 i.d6 (D)
From the point of view of opening theory, this is the crucial position of this opening. Black has occupied the centre and it is now up to White to show his intentions. Still, there is remarkably little 'accepted' theory on how to proceed. The sharpest and the most uncompro- mising move is undoubtedly 5 f4. The books do not agree on how good (or bad) this is. Should Black play 5,..'B'c7, for instance, or is 5...Rh44-
6 g3 Re7 more accurate? And in the latter vari-
ation, how good is 7 W'3 f6? Showing a little more self-restraint (and quite as logical as 5 f4) are the alternatives 5 c4 and 5 3f3 f6 6 c4. Bird Opening
1 f4 (D)
Opening with the king's bishop's pawn has been an accepted phenomenon for centuries, This may look very modest (just like 1 b3 in fact) but a closer examination reveals that it is both a courageous and ambitious move. After all, it allows Black to play 3...d5. The seemingly more aggressive 3 c4 is really much more cautious and conventional, since
OTHER FLANK OPENINGS 265
After 4 £jf 3. for instance. Black has two seri- ous variations: the uncompromising 4...g5 and the slightly more conventional 4...Nf6. But Black has to be aware of a counter- surprise: 2 e4 transposes to a King's Gambit. Instead of accepting the adversary's pawn sac- rifice, White is offering one himself! To offer a gambit like 1...e5 is first and fore- most a matter of taste. Many a positionally ori- ented player will not care much for such wild and unruly positions. Instead of considering whether and how to play ...e5, he will probably be thinking the same thoughts about ...d5. If Black plays neither L..d5 nor L..e5, he will have to take 2 e4 into account. After l...c5, for instance, 2 e4 or 2 Nf3 g6 (or 2...Nc6) 3 e4 transposes to a line of the Sicilian Defence, while I...Nf6 2 ?3f3 g6 is also likely to raise questions of e4 sooner or later; e.g., after 3 g3 Ng7 4 Ag2 O-O 5 O-O c5 6 d3. If Black chooses to play ...d5 at some point (which I shall consider the main line) we have, in effect, the typical pawn-structure of the Dutch Defence, with colours reversed.
2 Nf3
Although colours are reversed and White is a tempo ahead of Black in the normal Dutch Defence, positional themes remain largely the same. Probably the greatest difference is that, owing to a scarcity of top-level games, there is far less theory about 1 f4 than there is about 1 d4 f5. So there is plenty of room for experi- ments here! Instead of 2 4bf3, for instance, it might be an interesting idea to play 2 b3. preventing 2...g6. but when the English player Henry Bird (1830- 1908) began to play 1 f4 regularly, according to himself "because he had forgotten the more fa- miliar openings after a six years' absence from chess", the opening came to be named after him. It has also been called the Dutch Attack. The Bird Opening has always been the do- main of 'ordinary' club players rather than grandmasters, but just as with 1 g3 and 1 b3, the Danish world-class player Bent Larsen de- serves a special mention in this respect. He ad- mitted that his colleagues did not think much of 1 f4, but "precisely for this reason they do not play it and have no knowledge of it". Larsen himself on the other hand knew the possibilities of this opening very well and he had some shrewd and original ideas about it. He often used it as a surprise weapon or to test his oppo- nents. Well, if they think 1 f4 is not a good move, let them show it! So in a way he was sub- jecting his opponents to an examination, which of course always added a certain psychological tension to the opening phase. 1 ... d5
1 f4 can be played for all sorts of reasons but
- remarkably! - preventing L..e5 is not one of them, for the pawn sacrifice l...e5 2 fxeS d6 is in fact the most radical attempt to try to refute 1 f4. It is called the From Gambit. After 3 cxd6 J.xd6 (D) White is threatened with mate in three (starting with 4...Rh4+) and although this threat can easily be warded off. the fact remains that the situation is tricky and that it will de- mand a lot of sangfroid and inventiveness from both players to handle these complications.

Whether it is also the best move objec- tively is moot. 2...c5 and 2...g6 look like logical alternatives. development ...c5 and ...5fc6 and intensifying the fight for control over the centre. This is in effect an improved version of the Orang Utan. 1 3c3 (Van Geet Opening)
1 S)c3 (D)
Just like in the 'regular' Dutch, White now faces a fundamental choice between a plan based on g3 and one that is built around e3. with the latter option being subdivided into sev- eral variations.
3 g3 is of course the Leningrad Variation re-
versed. Here, the position after 3...g6 4 jLg2 aLg7 5 O-O O-O 6 d3 c5 is the most important starting point, with 7 ?3c3, 7 c3 and 7 Qel be- ing the main options.
3 e3 is usually played not so much intending
a Stonewall formation (pawns on d4 and f4), which would perhaps be unnecessarily defen- sive with White, but with a rather more aggres- sive scheme in mind, trying to take advantage of the extra tempo. The choice is mainly be- tween the plan of the Classical Dutch; e.g..
3...g6 4 jLe2 Ji.g7 5 O-O O-O 6 d3 c5 7 Wei . and
a plan based on b3. The latter possibility is rarely a serious option in the Dutch Defence, mainly because White usually takes control of thehl-a8 diagonal himselfby playing (1 d4f5) 2 g3. But strategically it is perfectly logical to put a bishop on b2, for this increases White's influence in the centre in a very natural way. After 3,..g6, a plausible continuation is 4 h3 Jtg7 5 lb2 O-O 6 .fi.e2 c5 7 O-O <2)c6. but Larsen (of course!) has had the original idea of playing 4 b4. thus preventing Black's standard At first glance this move may create the im- pression of being the logical counterpart of 1 Nf3, the Rdti Opening. But this impression is very deceptive indeed. In fact the two knight moves have nothing in common whatsoever. By playing 1 <?3f3, White prevents l...c5 and prepares to meet l...d5 with 2 c4, attacking Black's central position from (he flank, a plan that we have come to know as a classical exam- ple of flank strategy. What a contrast with 1 Nc3, which not only does nothing to prevent the corresponding advance l...d5, it even asks for it! What is more. White does not intend to counterattack from the flank, but right through the middle with 2 e4. making it not a fight for control over the centre, but a fight in the centre. Even if Black does not play l...d5. preferring, for instance, l...e5, l...c5 or 1...5T6. the open- ing struggle will revolve around moves like e4 and d4. which open the centre rather than play around it. It would therefore be misleading to call the Van Geet Opening a flank opening, for it is nothing of the kind. It is a 1 e4 opening in disguise. 1 £jc3 has been lying around in a corner of opening theory's attic for a very long time, for lack of a champion and a clear interpretation.
OTHER FLANK OPENINGS 267
But since the Dutch master Dick van Geet has used it with great success, both in over-the- board and in correspondence chess, driving in- numerable opponents to despair in the process. 1 5k3 has finally aroused public interest. Its merits have recently been hotly debated and many assessments have hcen overturned. 1 ... d5 This and l...e5 are of course the first moves to be considered, at least if Black intends to deal firmly with 1 <?k3. Both moves allow a transpo- sition to an entirely different opening, but Van Gcct's idea is certainly not simply to make use of these possible transpositions as soon as they are available. He wants to toy with them, that is to keep them within reach, to make use of them if the moment is right, but above all: to try to find something which is even better. If l...eS. for instance, his idea is not to play 2 e4. which would transpose to the Vienna Game, but to start a fight in the centre with 2 Qc6
3 d4 exd4 4 Nxd4 (D).
There is no deep strategy involved, but these positions require a high degree of alertness and a capacity for independent and original think- ing. If Black plays l...c5, he can expect similar treatment. 2 e4 transposes to the Closed Sicil- ian (see page 391), but true Van Geet strategy is to play 2 Qf3, followed, for example, by
2...€)c6 3 d4 cxd4 4 ?)xd4 (D).
While Black then has to remain alert to a possible transposition to the Sicilian Defence (with e4), he also has more vicious threats to cope with. Playing in the spirit of the Svesh- nikov Variation (see page 411), for instance, with 4...e5 5 Ndb5 d6?, fails miserably to 6 Nd5! and Black gets squashed as he cannot de- fend c7. If Black wants to be entirely safe from treach- erous ambushes like the above, his best bet is probably to play (D). Black then not only has to take another trans- position into account, viz. to the Scotch, he also has to guard against a few far more venomous options. For example, 4...g6 is very risky be- cause of 5 4Bd5, threatening 6 Nb5. Nor does 4,..'53f6 reach the 'safe haven' of the Scotch (5 c4), for White has the alternative 5 Jtg5. And the variation 4...d5 5 e4 is another beautiful il- lustration of the very high 1 e4 content of the Van Geet Opening. It is all about fast piece development and keeping an eye out for tactical opportunities.
268 FUNDAMENTAL CHESS OPENINGS
Now, if White does not want to take the emergency exit of playing 2 <14 or 2 e4 (which are perfectly sound options) he will really have to create his own footpaths. With 2 d5 3 e3, for instance, White is turning his back on estab- lished opening theory for good. 2 e4(D) White wants to develop his light-squared bishop to c4 and create attacking chances on the kingside. If Black prevents this by 4...±e6, White has an alternative method of development in 5 c3 c5 6 Jtb5+ Qd7 (or 6...Qc6) 7 Nf3. A deceptive position arises after 2...dxe4 3 lS)xe4 /D). One would say that it should be very easy to find something more useful than 3...e6 or 3...c6 (when 4 d4 would produce a French Defence or a Caro-Kann respectively). Still, there does not seem to be any consensus on what that 'easy' improvement should be. Both 3...e5 and 3...Cfd7 are met by 4 Jtc4, pricking Black's Achilles' Heel f7 rather annoyingly. Black must tread carefully. A few examples: after 3../5)d7 4 Nc4 3)gf6 (4...<R)df6 is more solid) he has to take the sacrifice 5 Bxf7+l? into account. After 5...>Nxf7 6 <2jg5+ SSgS 7 5)e6 White is already winning back some material. And if 3...e5 4 .c4. the plausible 4..ZAf6 is risky' due to 5 '2fg5 while the seemingly more prudent 4...Ji.e7? is even worse (5 Qh5!). Perhaps the most reliable move is 4...€Bc6.
3...Jtf5, analogous to the 4.. Jtf5 variation
of the Caro-Kann, is a sound option, but even here an interesting point of 1 £}c3 is revealed: White does not have to hurry with d4. After 4 £}g3 Ji-gG 5 43f3 Qd7 there is the possibility of playing 6 Jlc4 c6 7 d3. This reduces the sphere of influence of Black's g6-bishop, which is now not as actively placed at it is in the more common version of this type of position with While's pawn on d4. This is the main starting point of the Van Geet Opening. Again, there are a great many possible transpositions to 1 e4 openings to be aware of. 2...5)f6, for instance, is a minor varia- tion of the Alekhine Defence, 2...c6 a Caro- Kann and 2...e6 a French Defence. But anyone interested in really testing the strength of the Van Geet Opening is likely to prefer cither 2...d4 or 2...dxe4, Both moves are logical and attractive, but it would be unwise to underestimate White's chances. After 2...d4 3 &ce2 e5 4 <2Bg3 (D), a crucial position is reached. 1 e4 Is there something special about this move, something mysterious? The answer is paradoxical. If there is such a thing as a secret of 1 c4. then it must be its com- plete lack of mystery'. The lucidity, the directness and the almost naive sweetness of it are staring one in the face. White takes a healthy step for- ward. opens the way for his bishop and queen (perhaps already thinking of a Scholar's Mate: Ac4 followed by Qh5 and Rxf7#) and is threat- ening (on a higher level of strategic thinking) to take full control of the centre with 2 d4. It is this noble simplicity that makes 1 e4 such a wonder- ful move for beginner and grandmaster alike. The next question that the chess world has had to answer, and which every individual player will face, is of course how to respond to such a demonstration of power. For centuries this was in fact as much of a non-issue as the question regarding White's first move. It was a matter of course that Black was thinking in exactly the same terms as his opponent. A respectable game of chess between (wo respectable people could only start in one respectable way: 1 e4 e5 (D). By opening the game with his king's pawn, White enters into an ancient and venerable tra- dition. Our oldest sources, books from the 15th century, make it emphatically clear that 1 e4 (D) was the opening move even in those days. This situation remained basically unchanged for centuries. It was not until the rise of mod- ern, positional chess at the end of the 19th cen- tury that 1 d4 rose to the fore and then it took another half century or so for 1 c4 and 1 to achieve similar recognition. Nowadays, the choice of a first move is largely a matter of taste. Every one of these opening moves has its own specific conse- quences, brings about certain typical positions and creates its own specific problems. It is not enough to compare these consequences objec- tively (if such a comparison is possible); indi- vidual preferences and differences in playing style are at least as important when it comes to deciding how to open a chess game. This historic development of opening theory is mirrored by the individual learning process of most chess-players. Almost everyone starts out with 1 e4 and does not learn or practise other moves until later. Why is it then, that 1 e4 is the birthplace of all opening theory, both individually and globally? Only here, on the second move, did the roads in antiquity' diverge. White's most obvi- ous continuation was (and still is) the powerful
270 FUNDAMENTAL CHESS OPENINGS
developing move 2 <2jf3, by which, in a very natural, almost casual, way he attacks e5. It is from this move that some of the oldest and most important openings in chess literature have sprung. In the first place - from a modern perspec- tive at least - there is the Ruy Lopez (also called the Spanish Opening): 2...Nc6 3 Jl.b5. This is a very ancient opening, but it was not until the middle of the 19th century that it - gradually yet irresistibly - emerged as the most critical test of 1 ...c5. a position it has held to this day. White introduces the possibility of taking on c6, thus indirectly threatening Black's eS- pawn. About the same age as the Ruy Lopez is the Italian Game, 2...Q)c6 3 Bc4. By putting his king's bishop on c4. White is creating threats that at first glance seem much more dangerous than 3 Jtb5, because they are directed at Black's most vulnerable spot, f7. For many beginners this is the most attractive opening and histori- cally 3 -Nc4 was the first move to develop a se- rious body of opening theory. Today, there are quite a number of forcing variations in this opening, so a certain knowledge of those is rec- ommended. Equally forceful, yet wholly different in na- ture, is 2...<5>c6 3 d4, the Scotch Opening. White opens the centre, eliminates Black's e- pawn and prepares the way for some fast and aggressive development. Finally, there is the Four Knights Game, in- troduced with 2...Nc6 3 41c3 <STf6 . This ancient opening has stood the test of time just as the other openings mentioned. Like the Scotch, it has recently enjoyed a veritable revival. So far we have only considered 2...£k:6 as a reply to 2 441'3, but this is not Black's only op- tion. 2...Nf6 in particular is a major alternative. Instead of defending his pawn on e5, Black counterattacks against e4. This is the Petroff or Russian Defence. It rivals the four 2...4Bc6 openings above in ancientness and surpasses most of them in importance. Today, in the early years of the 21st century, this move is extremely popular with players at the very highest level. As a result, it is more relevant to the theoretical sta- tus of 1 e4 now than it has ever been in the past. Nowadays. 2 Qif3 may look not just natural but completely self-evident, to the beginner and the experienced tournament player alike. How could White possibly do better than this? But this outlook has not always been the universally accepted one. In the first half of the 19th cen- tury in particular, the position after 1 e4 e5 was viewed in a totally different light. In those days players were not concerned with the difficult strategic problem of how best to attack Black's e5-pawn in such a way as to obtain long-term prospects of building up a solid initiative. They were looking for ways of annihilating Black 's king, right now. Seen from this perspective, (he knight is not very well placed on f3 at all; on the contrary, it is standing in the way. That f-file needs to be opened! 2 f4 has to be played first, and only after 2...exf4 can the knight be devel- oped: 3 Nf3. Bishop to c4, pawn to d4, castles, and wow! What could be possibly come be- tween White and a brilliant victory? This is the King's Gambit, an opening that symbolizes power, courage and elegance for some, and utter madness to others. White gives away a pawn and weakens his own king's posi- tion, but he firmly takes the initiative and opens files and diagonals that are meant to lead not to his own but to Black's king. Although it seems an anachronism in today's world of ever more accurately calculating computers, the King's Gambit remains a living opening to this day. Back to 1 e4. No matter how dominant the reply l...e5 may have been, even in ancient times alternative moves were known and ex- amined. though they were usually considered inferior. This situation began to change around 1800, when the first of these alternatives to gain recognition was l...e6. Black follows a com- pletely different strategy here. He allows White to play 2 d4, only to hit back immediately with
2...d5. This opening came to be known as the
French Defence and it has been considered safe and sound now for some two hundred years. With the acceptance of the French Defence, the ground was prepared for other openings that deviated even further from classical prin- ciples. In the second half of the 19th century, the move l...c6 was given a face and a name:
1 e4 271
the Caro-Kann Defence. Just as in the French. Black intends toplay 2...d5. What makes l...c6 much harder to swallow from a classical point of view though, is that it is not a developing move. No diagonal is opened for the king's bishop (as with 1 ...e6) and the 'natural' square c6 is made unavailable to the queen's knight. Nevertheless, this treatment of the opening has shown itself to be effective. Compared to the French, the great advantage of 1 ...c6 is that the other black bishop, the one on c8, now has much better prospects. A third move to gain some (modest) recogni- tion in the 19th century was l...c5, the Sicilian Defence. This move is easier to accept from a classical viewpoint in one way, namely that it stops White from occupying the centre w'ith 2 d4, but since it does nothing for quick piece de- velopment (just like 1 ...c6) it was mistrusted for a very long time. It does not even do anything to attack White's e4-pawn, as l...e6 and I...c6 do. A fundamental reassessment of one very im- portant type of middlegame was needed before the Sicilian could be viewed in a more positive light. Al first it was thought that 2 *?)f3, fol- lowed by 3 d4 and an exchange of pawns in the centre, would give White a very comfortable position indeed. Shielded by his stronghold on e4, White will easily find some good squares for his pieces, not to mention the impressive spatial advantage that White enjoys in this kind of position. The advantages of Black's position are less obvious, yet very slowly - and this is a process that has spanned the entire 20th cen- tury - they have come to the fore. It is precisely here that a wealth of new' possibilities has come to light. It turned out that Black's seemingly cramped position contains enormous power that is only waiting to be released. By now many different schemes of develop- ment have been discovered for Black, each one of them based on solid strategic considerations and each with its own specific advantages. A chess-player from the 21st century looks at these positions in a way that is completely dif- ferent from the outlook of his predecessor of one or tw'o centuries ago. Nowadays, even the enormous amount of variations available to Black is enough to intimidate many a player behind the w'hite pieces into avoiding the main lines based on 2 S)f3 and 3 d4. The search for possible alternatives to the classical l...e5 reached its peak in the 1920s, 1921 to be exact, when Alexander Alekhine, one of the most famous grandmasters in the history of chess, stalled experimenting with the shock- ing l...<2)f6. This move is nothing less than a provocation, not just addressed at White's e- pawn, but at White himself. If White accepts the challenge by 2 c5. Black will respond 2...Nd5 and start attacking White's pawn in earnest with ...d6. Black freely allows his opponent to play d4 and to chase his knight away a second time (with c4). In fact the whole idea of this opening is to provoke White into occupying too much of the centre. This will almost always lead to a sharp fight, for it is true that although White is taking a natural, aggressive step forward by playing 2 e5, he is also sticking his neck out. This open- ing is now known as the Alekhine Defence (even though there is little defensive about it). Superficially, to play l...d6 is to take a step backwards on this rising scale of ever more dar- ing replies to 1 e4. After all. this move prepares
2...Nf6 by eliminating the advance e5. Is not
that an outdated viewpoint? But what l...d6 sacrifices in speed, it gains in depth. I...d6 is not a slow or a passive opening move. Black al- lows his opponent to form a 'perfect' pawn- centre with 2 d4, but he is doing so on the as- sumption that there is no real danger in this. This attitude is based either on a naive lack of understanding or on a very profound under- standing indeed. This is the Pirc Defence, that was not drawn out of the marshlands of that much-distrusted category of 'irregular' open- ings until after 1950. It is (more or less) the fi- nal destination of our survey of 1 e4. All of these openings, ranging from the frank l...e5 to the profound l...d6, have their own ideas, their own 'speed' and their own pe- culiar strategic colouring. They are all play- able. Choosing between them is a matter of personal style and perhaps a question of how much study material one is able to deal with. Il is my hope that this book may help the reader to form his own judgement of these and related as- pects of the game of chess. Ruy Lopez

playing ...b5 at a moment of his own choosing. It is from this position that the great main lines of the Ruy Lopez have germinated, some of them more than twenty moves deep and with innumerable subvariations. Nevertheless, around 2000 the natural and simple move 3...'?)f6 enjoyed a wave of enor- mous popularity. This is the Berlin Defence, which is much older than 3...a6, but seemed to have all but disappeared in the 20th century, when it was thought that on general grounds the insertion of 3...a6 4 Ba4 could only be to Black's advantage. But the present popularity of 3...Nf6 is based on a highly specific way of making use of White's bishop standing on b5 rather than at a4.
3...f5 is a move of a totally different calibre.
This is in fact a variation on the theme of the King's Gambit and it has caused many a 3 Jib5 player a headache over the years. Although al- ways looked upon with distrust at the very high- est level, this bold pawn sacrifice has always had a large following among the masses. It is called the Jaenisch Gambit or Schliemann Defence and it is only recommended for lovers of sharp and concrete variations who are not afraid of taking risks. I shall treat these three moves as main lines in this book. But in a truly great opening like the Ruy Lopez, almost all legal moves have been investigated at one time or another and have been given a name, an assessment and a set of variations in chess literature. The best of these 'alternative' lines are undoubtedly quite playable and each of them has its own (modest) circle of adherents.
3...d6 (D). for example, the Steinitz Defence,
certainly deserves our respect, if only because it is named after the first world champion, Wil- helm Steinitz (1836-1900). Black defends his pawn on e5 and prepares ...Jld7, neutralizing the pin of the c6-knight. This ancient opening owes its name to the Spaniard Ruy Lopez de Segura (c. 1530-80), who recommended 3 jLb5 in a book published in 1561. This did not greatly impress his con- temporaries. however, and for a very long time the Italian Game (3 Jcc4) was far more popular. It was in fact not until the 1840s that the time was ripe for a proper appreciation of 3 Bb5. From this time onwards, the Ruy Lopez be- came increasingly popular, not only gradually surpassing the Italian, but also pushing al! al- ternatives to 2 9)f3. most notably the King's Gambit, into the background. The Ruy Lopez became the opening against l...e5, a position it has not lost in over a century and a half of ever- changing positional insights. This steadfast reputation of 3 J.b5 is almost equalled by the status of 3...a6 as the most pop- ular reply. What justifies this little yet signifi- cant move is the fact that 4 .xc6 dxc6 5 Nxe5 does not win a pawn (yet), because of 5...Rd4. but a much deeper point of 3...a6 is revealed af- ter 4 Jla4: from now on Black has the opportu- nity of breaking the pin of the c6-knight by
RUY LOPEZ 273
4...f5 (4...*R3f6 is a more solid alternative). An-
other point of 3...Bc5, one of a strategic na- ture, comes to light after 4 O-O (which takes the edge off 4..T5, for this move can now sim- ply be met by 5 exf5 e4 6 Sei). Black ex- changes a pair of knights with 4...£jd4 5 5)xd4 .s.xd4. which allows White to build up his de- sired central pawn-formation by 6 c3 Ab6 7 d4, but gives Black the opportunity to consolidate his own central stronghold with 7".c6, followed by 8...d6. Unlike 4 c3 f5, this variation offers quiet, positional play where White needs the ability to make the most of a small lead in de- velopment and a tiny space advantage. The same idea can be implemented rather more drastically by playing 3...Qd4 (D), the Bird Defence. This is a solid plan, with a single drawback only, namely that it allows White to carry on with his development undisturbed. A charac- teristic type of middlegame arises after 4 d4 exd4 5 4)xd4 Jtd7 (or 4...Bd7 5 5)c3 exd4 6 <2)xd4). White enjoys a space advantage and easy development for his pieces, but Black's position has no weaknesses and is intrinsically sound, if - for the moment - a Little passive. Though this is not necessarily a problem, it has caused top players to prefer the Neo-Steinitz (3...a6 4 jLa4 d6; see page 277), where it is not so easy for White to achieve this type of posi- tion. Likewise, 3...Bc5 (D), the Cordel Varia- tion can hardly be pul down as an obscure side- line. In this case, however, Black has to recapture on d4 with his e-pawn, which makes quite a difference. This unorthodox approach dates back to the 19th century but enjoyed a revival around 1980. After 4 Nxd4 exd4 the pawn on d4 makes it impossible for White to make a quick d4 advance, so he needs another plan. The obvious solution is to play O-O, d3 and f4. Black will be looking at ...c6 and ...d5 for counterplay.
3...a6
3 ... a6 (D) This move is called the Morphy Defence, but it is now so firmly established as the main line that this name is rarely used. This is a sharper approach than 3...d6, espe- cially if Black is intending to meet 4 c3 (in preparation of 5 d.4) with the gambit variation
274 FUNDAMENTAL CHESS OPENINGS
Fischer turned it into a dangerous weapon in the 1960s it suddenly became very popular, with quite a number of players going so far as to specialize in this line. White has two main trumps. In the short term he has a lead in development, while in the long run he can build on his superior pawn-structure. And of course 4 Jlxc6 has the added practical advantage of avoiding the enormous mass of theory involved in the Ruy Lopez main lines (all starting with 4 Jl.a4). Looking from Black's perspective, there is no choice. If Black wants to play one of the main lines of the Ruy Lopez, he will have to reconcile himself to the Exchange Variation and its unique character. Fortunately, there are plenty of reasons for such a reconciliation. For one thing. Black's lag in development is not as bad as it looks. By recapturing with his d-pawn. he has opened a diagonal for his light-squared bishop and a file for the queen, which means that even without making a move, these two pieces are half-developed already. On the whole it can be said that Black enjoys an unusually great freedom of movement in the Exchange Variation.
5 O-O
This is White's most flexible move and ever since the days of Bobby Fischer this has been the main line. But in order to get a first impres- sion of the positional make-up of the Exchange Variation, it may be useful to take a brief look at the older move 5 d4. With this move White simplifies the position considerably. He is hoping that the endgame after 5...exd4 6 Qxd4 xd4 7 Nxd4 (D) will be in his favour, be- cause of the simple fact that White has a sound pawn-majority on the kingside (meaning that this majority will logically result in a passed pawn), while Black's majority on the opposite wing, handicapped in this respect by the dou- bled pawns, cannot hope to achieve the same result (at least not without a little help from White). Unfortunately for White (and luckily for Black) there are some downsides too to this beautifully straightforward plan. Because the move d4 has opened the position even further, Black's bishop-pair will gain in strength and his As I have already indicated, there is nothing to be gained now by playing the greedy 4 Jlxc6 dxc6 5 'ZixeS, as Black wins back his pawn im- mediately. But White has more profound moves than 5 <Jxe5 and these are of sufficient interest to turn this into an important system. This is the Exchange Variation, which occupies a very special place in the Ruy Lopez. The alternative of course, and the most com- mon move by far. is to play 4 Ji.a4, when Black is facing the same problems as on move three. Exchange Variation
4 Jlxc6 dxc6 (D)
By exchanging on c6. White has chosen a type of middlegame that differs considerably from the majority of Ruy Lopez variations. For a long time it was thought that this was com- pletely harmless for Black, but when Bobby
RL'Y LOPEZ 275
spectacular idea is by no means a refutation of 5 O-O. It is true that there is the opportunity for White to self-destruct with something silly like 7 hxg4 hxg4 8 £jxe5?? Rh4, but if White pro- ceeds with a little more caution than this, there is no reason why he should have any particular problems completing a healthy development. A critical position arises after 7 d3 Qf6 8 ?ibd2 (if 8 hxg4 hxg4 9Qg5. Black has 9...Rh6) 8...Ne7 9 2el £3g6 10 d4 Ji.d6 (D). Hi rooks will find dominant positions on the two central files. After queenside castling in particu- lar (7...,&.d7 followed by 8...O-O-O for instance) Black has good prospects of attacking the e4- pawn and taking over the initiative with moves like ...c5, ...2e8 and ...f5. However, as we are about to see. White does not reject this plan by playing 5 O-O (D). Rather, he is hoping to execute it under more favour- able circumstances. And this, of course, is the essence of opening theory. It is not just a matter of finding the right plan, it is at least as impor- tant to implement the plan as advantageously as possible. Opening theory is a never-ending search for the optimal solution. Black has positioned his pieces very threat- eningly, but the cold-blooded 11 hxg4 hxg4 12 Nh2 Hxh2! (12...Rh4? fails to 13 " dfl) 13 Rxg4! ( 13 4'xh2? Qxf2 would be very danger- ous indeed) and now', for instance, 13...5h4 14 Qf5 neutralizes Black's initiative. After the storm has died dow'n, the game finally takes on the desired Exchange Variation features. The simple 5,..f6 (D) is less pretentious than
5....Ng4 and has always had a solid reputation.
I i?"ii- Now' Black has to concern himself with the defence of the c5-pawn. For years it was thought that 5...J_g4 6 h3 h5!? was the perfect answer to this problem, but even before Fischer, the Dutch master Johan Barendregt demonstrated that this
276 FUNDAMENTAL CHESS OPENINGS
In fact there is only one drawback to this move, namely that the standard plan of 6 d4 exd4 7 Nxd4 c5 8 Nb3 (or 8 <2)e2) 8...Wxdl 9 fixdl now produces the desired result of being relatively favourable to White as compared to 5 d4, since castling has been very useful for White, while Black's 'extra' move ...f6 is of vir- tually no use at all in this type of position. Nev- ertheless, this is an important starting position for a great many deeply-analysed variations. Black does have one major alternative, which is to play 6...dLg4 instead of 6..,exd4. This too usually results in an endgame: 7 dxe5 Wxdl 8 fixdl fxe5. Black has maintained a pawn on e5, but whether this is something to be proud of re- mains to be seen. It is true that this pawn keeps White's pawn-majority on the kingside in check, but it is also quite vulnerable. Still, this is an important variation which has enjoyed spells of popularity at the highest level. Another way of protecting e5, 5...Jld6, has never enjoyed the same popularity, probably because after 6 d4 Black will have to give up his stronghold anyway, since 6...f6?l 7 dxe5 fxe5?l would now be refuted by 8 <2)xe5! ji.xe5 9 Qh5+. The alternative 6...exd4 7 xd4 also looks a bit gloomy at first sight since White is threatening to take on g7, but it is precisely this position, with 7..T6 as the critical move, which makes 5...Jld6 a very interesting possibility. Black has avoided an exchange of queens and provided he succeeds in completing his devel- opment, he has every reason to be satisfied with the opening. Modem opening theory does not care much for general considerations and is based to a great extent on concrete and exact calculations. This computerlike attitude has brought 5...'S>d6 (D) to the fore, an ugly move at first sight, but probably the main line nowadays alongside
5...f6.
If 6 d4 exd4 7 xd4, Black does not worry about having lost a tempo and simply plays
7...Qxd4 8 Qixd4 i.d7. If 7 xd4 instead.
Black has a very aggressive reply in 7...Ad7. followed by 8...O-O-O and in some cases ...Qg6. A subtler attempt to harass the black queen is to play 6 d3, with the idea bd2-c4. yet Black has plenty of time to prepare himself for this simultaneous attack against his queen and his pawn on e5. for instance with 6...<?2e7 7 ,?2bd2 Ng6. The same idea, executed in a subtler way, un- derlies 6 5 a3. White preserves the option of opening the centre quickly and efficiently with d4. Should Black reply 6...b5, White has 7 c3, preparing d4 and bringing the knight back into play via c2. If 6...die6, White has both 7 Ng5 and 7 Re2 followed by 8 <?2Bc4 or 8 fid 1 and d4. In the position after 5...Rd6 6 f2ja3. which has been very popular since the 1990s. the Exchange Variation shows its tactical, explosive side. This variation has two faces. Players who feel at home both in the dry. technical positions of 5...f6
6 d4 exd4 and in the dangerous, double-edged
tactical melee of 5...Qd6 6 Na3 are the ones for whom the Exchange Variation is tailor-made.
4 Aa4
4 Na4 (D)
If this move had a motto, it would probably be 'the threat is stronger than its execution'. White does not let himself be tempted by the exchange on c6 and maintains the tension. This gives Black the opportunity of immedi- ately chasing the bishop off the a4-e8 diagonal by playing 4...b5, the Taimanov Variation. Another plausible reply is to play 4...d6, the Neo-Steinitz Variation. But the most popular move by far is 4...£jf6. It is on this natural developing move that the lion's share of the theory of the Ruy Lopez has been built.
RUY LOPEZ 277
It is this daring knight sortie which gives
4...b5 a face of its own. Black jumps at the op-
portunity not just to chase away the white bishop, but to eliminate it.
6 O-O
Black's plan is positionally motivated, but it is made possible by two tactical points. In the first place, White cannot just win a pawn by taking on e5. because 6 Nxe5 <£jxb3 7 axb3 Rg5 wins back the pawn immediately. Sec- ondly, the tempting piece sacrifice 6 Nxf7+ xf7 7 4)xe5+ does not refute 5...Na5. After the calm 7...Qe7 8 5)c3 Bb7 Black should be able to hold his own. 6 ... d6
7 d4 2Bxb3
8 axb3 f6 (D) Conspicuously absent from this list is the gambit move 4...f5, which was considered a main line just one move earlier (3...f5). The rea- son for this is that with the bishop on a4. the re- ply 5 d4 is now very dangerous for Black. Since
5...fxe4 6 Nxe5 <Nxe5 7 dxe5 c6 no longer
makes sense (which it does after 3...f5 4 d4; see page 299), Black has little choice but to play
5...exd4. But now comes a surprising yet typi-
cal positional pawn sacrifice, revealing the darker sides of ...f5: 6 e5. While obstructing Black's natural kingside development (no f6- square for the knight), White is hoping to ob- tain a tangible initiative. After 6..Bc5 7 O-O QJge7 8 ±b3, for instance. Black's king has trouble getting away from the centre.
VV
Taimanov Variation 4 ...
5 Nb3
This is the strategic idea of the Taimanov Variation. Black maintains his stronghold on e5 in an unorthodox yet extremely solid way. Because White no longer has a light-squared bishop, Black need not worry about opening the a2-g8 diagonal, which would otherwise be a risky undertaking (as we have just seen in the
4...f5 variation).
White has a considerable lead in develop- ment, but he will have to proceed with patience and accuracy if he is to make an impact on Black's sturdy position. He may aim for Qh4 and f4 to try and break Black's grip on e5. b5 <2\a5 (D) Neo-Steinitz Variation 4 ... d6 (D)
278 FUNDAMENTAL CHESS OPENINGS
If Black plays 6...exd4, he gives White what he was looking for. but it is moot to whose ad- vantage this is. for Black's freedom of move- ment is considerably greater than in the position after 3...d6 4 d4 exd4 5 Nxd4 Nd7. Black also has 6...f6. defending his central outpost in much the same way as in the Tai- manov Variation. This is hardly a move to pro- mote a speedy development (since f6 is made unavailable to the knight and the f8-bishop will have to remain dormant for the time being), but it does give Black a very solid position. White's most important moves, however, are
5 c3 and 5 O-O.
This variation is sometimes called the Im- proved Steinitz Variation because by inserting
3...a6 4 Jca4 Black has defused 5 d4 (which is
the main drawback of 3...d6), for this would now run into 5...b5 6 Jtb3 <?Rd4 7 Nxd4 exd4. when 8 'i ,xd4?? loses a piece to 8...c5! fol- lowed by 9...c4, an opening trap typical of the Ruy Lopez, and so old that it is known as the Noah's Ark Trap. 9 Qd5, with a double attack against a8 and f7, does not help because of
9...6e6 10 Rc6+ Nd7 11 'S'd5 c4 and the
bishop is lost in any case. 5 jixc6+ is a subtler attempt to bring about that typical Steinitz Defence type of middle- game. When compared to the Exchange Varia- tion, it seems a weird loss of time to play Xa4 first and -Nxc6+ immediately afterwards, but in fact the consequences are entirely different, be- cause Black now has to recapture with his b- pawn. After 5...bxc6 6 d4 (D) there are two variations: 5 c3
H
This is a move that we are going to see very often in the Ruy Lopez. White prepares to play d4. while creating an escape-route for his king's bishop via c2 so that he no longer has to worry about Black exchanging off his bishop with ...b5 followed by ...Qa5. The obvious draw- back to this plan is that development of the queenside is being held up and even made rather difficult. The knight on bl in particular will now not be able to join in the fight as easily and naturally as would have been the case if Nc3 were still possible. Nevertheless, the plan of playing c3 in this type of position is one of the cornerstones of the success of the Ruy Lopez. Tournament practice has shown that White usually manages to get away with its relative 1

RUY LOPEZ 279
slowness, mainly because exchanging pawns on d4 is normally very unattractive for Black in a situation where White can recapture with his c-pawn and maintain a strong central formation with pawns on e4 and d4. Effectively screened by these two pawns, White calmly develops his pieces, the queen's knight typically following the route 4).bd2-f1 . when both e3 and g3 are at- tractive squares. Generally speaking, Black has two funda- mentally different ways in which to react. He can either let the opponent do whatever he likes and make optimal use of the opportunity to de- velop his own position as well as he can, or he can start a fight in the centre at once, before White is ready for it. In most cases the choice is a matter of opinion and personal style. This po- sition is no exception. Black can either proceed with his development or make an attempt to punish 5 c3 with the aggressive 5...f5. If Black chooses the former plan, then his most flexible option is to play S..Bd7 for the alternative 5...Nf6 can simply be met by 6 d4, when 6...<2Bxe4?? loses a piece to 7 d5 b5 8 lc2. In the position after 5..Bd7 6 d4. three main lines have been developed over the years. The oldest and most straightforward is to play
6...<2)f6 7 O-O Nc7 8 Sei O-O. Slightly more
subtle is 6... ge7, intending 7 O-O '/2g6, when the king's knight supports e5 and may be em- ployed aggressively on the kingside (ideas like ...i2)h4 and ...Be7-g5 spring to mind). This line can lead to sharp play, especially if White responds with 7 Ae3 (to meet 7...£}g6 with 8 h4) or 7 ±b3, which threatens 8 Ng5 and forces Black to play 7...h6. A third option is to play 6...g6 7 O-O Jlg7, postponing the decision whether to play ...A'.f6 or ...£jge7. All these plans offer Black a solid position, but no pros- pects of quick counterplay. This cannot be said about 5...f5 ID). This move has been given the rather strange name of Siesta Variation, even though it is ob- vious that neither player will be able to afford a little nap in this position. It is an excellent mo- ment for playing ...f5, since White has no ag- gressive reply. The critical position arises after 6 exf5 Nxf5 7 O-O (if 7 d4, in order to prevent Black's next move, 7...e4 gives Black a com- fortable position) 7...Jid3 8 Sei Ae7. Black's d3-bishop paralyses White's entire queenside and has to be removed at once, but an important point of Black's plan is that 9 3e3 can be met by 9...e4, when 10 Nei Ag5 11 Eh3 O-O 12 Nxd3 exd3 13 fixd3 gives Black excellent compensation for the lost pawn in the shape of a huge lead in development. 9 Ac2 is a more cautious approach. Now 9...e4 10 Axd3 exd3 1 1 Rb3 is risky for Black and most players pre- fer 9...Axc2 10 Qxc2 Qf6.
5 O-O
5 O-O
This is a plausible move. White avoids the complications of the Siesta Variation (5...1'5 6 exf5 Bxf5 is rather pointless with White hav- ing substituted the useful move O-O for the weakening c3), while moves like 5...Bd7 and
5...Nf6 can be met in much the same way as be-
fore. If 5...Nf6, for instance, 6 Eel jLe7 7 c3 O-O 8 d4 Bd7 transposes to a variation that we have just seen as part of the 5 c3 complex. But there is one problem with 5 O-O, a theo- retical as well as a practical one: White is walking into a minefield. //Black has a lot of self-confidence, if he has a great flair for tac- tics and if he is armed to the teeth with theoret- ical knowledge, he can now set the game on fire in a way which pales the complications of the Siesta Variation into insignificance. 5 ... ±g4

280 FUNDAMENTAL CHESS OPENINGS
tv We have seen this tactical motif before in the Exchange Variation (see page 275). Taking on g4 is useless, but contrary to the situation in the Exchange Variation White now has a very sharp reply: 7 d4. At first sight this seems ludicrous, because Black is invited to play 7...b5 8 Jlb3 53xd4. But now White accepts the piece sacri- fice and after 9 hxg4 hxg4 he has 10 ?3g5, blocking the black queen's way to h4. This leaves us, after the calm reply 10...<53116 (pro- tecting f7), with an extremely double-edged position, for on the one hand the knight is ex- cellently placed on g5, but on the other hand it will be attacked and has no escape-route. De- cades of analysis have failed to come up with a final assessment of this line. What is quite clear, though, is that if White wants to go in for this, he too will need self-confidence, tactical flair and some very solid preparation. 4 ... 53f6 (D) Black still does nothing to defend e5. Instead he attacks e4. White now faces the important decision about whether to protect this pawn.
5 O-O
This is unquestionably the critical move as well as the most flexible one. The only draw- back is that it is this very move which carries the heaviest burden of theoretical baggage and for this - essentially practical - reason many players prefer a different move after all. In fact, White has a number of alternatives, all of them quite reasonable but all of them takina away some of the positional tension. White is making life a little bit easier for himself (which is nice) but for his opponent as well (which is a pity). But in fact play does not really become easy at all. Each one of these alternatives has been minutely examined, just like every other varia- tion of the Ruy Lopez. I shall outline them very briefly. To begin with, While has 5 d3 (D). Now 6 -4,xc6 followed by 7 4)xe5 is finally a real threat and Black should not forget this.
5...b5 6 Jcb3 and now either 6..jke7 or 6...&C5
is a good reply, as is 5...d6. analogous to the Neo-Steinitz Variation. But the moved3 in gen- eral is not as harmless as it may look and there are very' many' positions in the Ruy Lopez where this move is a perfectly valid option. In most of these cases White continues c3, some- times followed by' d4 at a later stage, and con- centrates his forces mainly on the kingside. In
RUY LOPEZ 281
such a strategy it could prove useful to delay castling and play $Abd2-fl-e3 (or g3) first. 5 sLc3 is also a move that could be more than just a one-dimensional protection of c4. After
5...b5 6 ±b3 jLe7, for instance, White may try
to take the initiative with 7 d3 d6 8 4x15 or (sharper) 7 O-O d6 8 <5)d5. retaining the option of playing d4 without the loss of tempo d3. White need not worry about 8...4')xc4 since the reply 9 d4 followed by 10 Sei would then give him a strong initiative.
5 Qe2 is the alternative which stays closest
to the sort of play that is typical of the main line 5 O-O, because White usually continues in the same vein: c3 followed by d4, possibly in combination with 2dl. Apart from 5... 3xc4 of course. Black has the same range of possi- ble replies. After 5...b5 6 Ab3 he can play
6...Bc5, giving his king's bishop an active role
in the struggle for the centre; he also has the simple 6...£.el 7 O-O d6 8 c3 O-O analogous to the Closed Variation, or he can offer the same pawn sacrifice as in the Marshall Attack: 7...O-O
8 c3 d5.
Finally, White has a move that we have seen him play in several variations before, viz. 5 d4
(D).
...d5 or ...d6 usually neutralizes the danger. If
8...O-O, for instance, the pseudo-aggressive 9
2Bf5 is harmless because of 9...d5, making it impossible for White to maintain his knight on this beautiful square. We now return to the position after 5 O-O
(D):
It is from this position that the great main lines of the Ruy Lopez start. To begin with. Black has 5...Nxe4, the Open Variation (or the Open Spanish). This is a critical test of 5 O-O, though not in the sense of making White look stupid for forgetting to pro- tect c4, because White regains the pawn with- out any trouble. By taking on e4. Black opts for a direct confrontation and a relatively open type of position. Then there is 5,.. .e7, the Closed Variation (or the Closed Spanish). This move does not as yet define the character of the middlegame. Black may choose to keep the position closed, but he also has one extremely violent and ag- gressive possibility a few moves later. A third option and one that has become ex- tremely popular since the mid-1990s is 5...b5, introducing the Arkangelsk Variation and the Neo-Arkhangelsk. In the wake of this, the much older move 5...Ac5 has also come to the fore again, but with a re-interpretation that makes it a close relative of the Neo-Arkhangelsk. Open Variation 5 ... Nxe4 This is called the Centre Attack or the Cen- tre Gambit, even though there is no sacrifice involved (as the term 'gambit' would suggest). After 5...exd4, White regains the pawn by play- ing 6 c5 l9)c4 7 O-O jLcl 8 '?)xd4. This position may look promising for White at first glance, but closer inspection reveals that a well-timed
282 FUNDAMENTAL CHESS OPENINGS
Ik o player behind the black pieces will be un- der the illusion of winning a pawn here, for White need only take on c6 and e5 to level the material. But a deeper meaning behind 5...<2fxe4 is revealed once it becomes clear that such a simple and straightforward recapture does not promise White any opening advantage whatso- ever. From the lofty viewpoint of opening the- ory (which is never satisfied with anything less than maximum dividends). 6 jixc6 and 6 Sei Nc5 7 .xc6 dxc6 8 <23xe5 Jle7 leave White with empty hands. He has achieved nothing but a reduction of tension and material, leaving Black with easy development for his remaining pieces. But things look different when White chooses the one move that really puts 5...<2)xe4 to the test: 6 d4(D) forgotten. Only at the end ot the 20th century was this endgame analysed in depth and then it turned out to be not so easy lor While after all. At the moment the position after 7...d5 is un- dergoing some drastic theoretical renovation. Perhaps White should not play the obvious 8 ?3xd4 at all but try to unhinge Black's position with 8 c4!? instead. In any case, this is a beauti- ful example of a variation that has been gather- ing dust for decades and then suddenly turns out to be still fully alive! But the classical reply to 6 d4 remains... 6 ... b5 7 lb3 d5 8 dxe5 Jle6 (D) We have now reached the basic position of the Open Ruy Lopez.

With his pawn on d5. Black has gained a solid foothold in the centre, he has open diago- nals for both bishops and he has a knight ag- gressively posted at e4. White has a strong pawn on e5, potentially offering him attacking chances on the kingside. Who holds the advan- tage? It is only natural that this question should have caused a major division of minds. The Open Ruy Lopez has always had staunch sup- porters and equally fervent critics. Tarrasch. Lasker and Euwe considered it the main line of the Ruy Lopez and in more recent times Korch- noi and Yusupov have made a living out of it. As is usually the case in these sharp variations, playing them successfully requires a good deal of theoretical knowledge and a readiness (an Now Black has to be careful. For instance,

At first these problems centred mainly around 9 c3,but from 1981 onwards 9 <2)bd2 has be- come increasingly popular and this move now rivals 9 c3 as White's most dangerous fine. Nor have other moves been overlooked. Un- til 1981 it was 9 Re2 which was given as the main alternative to 9 c3 in opening manuals, but this move has receded into the background. Nowadays it is 9 Jle3 that can be said to be 'the alternative line'. However, this move is based on ideas very similar to 9 c3 and 9 Nbd2 and will not be elaborated in this book. 9 c3

The situation has changed dramatically in the last eight moves. Thanks to the pawn on f5, Black does not for the moment have to worry about a kingsidc attack. He also has an impres- sive pawn-phalanx on the queenside. This latter factor is critical for an evaluation of the posi- tion. White's standard plan is to play 17 a4, starting an attack against these pawns and hop- ing that they will turn into a row of targets rather than be a threat. 10 <£bd2 O-O

Now Black faces a fundamental decision. How should he deal with the attack on his knight? The range of possible answers varies from very simple to extremely complex. It is of course simplest to play 1 l...'2)xd2, yet this is remarkably unpopular probably be- cause it does not really put up a fight. After the subtle recapture 12 Rxd2! (intending to move the queen to d3 as quickly as possible - after 1 2 .Nxd2 f6 13 exf6 Rxf6 the bishop would be standing in the way on d2), followed, for exam- ple. by 12...1'6 13 exl'6Qxf6 14 Qd3 g6 15 l.h6 Sfe8 16 2ael, Black has completed not only his own development but also that of his oppo- nent. The first alternative that comes to mind is U...f5(D). This is sharper and therefore both riskier and more attractive than 1 l...£jxd2. If White goes The classical approach to the Open Varia- tion. White provides his king's bishop with an escape-route against a possible exchange with ...Na5 or ...Nc5 and prepares an attack against Black's aggressively-posted knight with Nbd2 and Jlc2. 9 ... i_c5 This way of developing the bishop has su- perseded the old main line 9....Ne7 ever since Viktor Korchnoi was successful with it in the 1970s and 1980s.

for lhe same type of position as in the line given above by playing 12 ext'6. Black is relatively better off after 12...'21xf6 13 2Bb3 jLb6. The critical response to H...f5 is thought to be 12 Nb3 Bb6 13 Q)fd4. Ever since the 19th century, each and every new generation has made an ef- fort trying to assess and calculate this position afresh. After 13.,.Nxd4 14 €Bxd4 ,Nxd4 15 cxd4 it looks like White has won the opening battle, for he is threatening to play 16 f.3, driving away the knight, after which the open c-file and the hole in Black's pawn-formation on c5 promise White a positional advantage. But Black has the diabolical reply 15.. .f4 16 f3 'Shg31, when after 17 hxg3 fxg3 all of a sudden a threat of mate in the shape of 18...Rh4 is looming over While's king. White in his turn has the clever re- sponse 18 Qd3, with the double idea of neutral- izing 18...Rh4 with 19 Qxh7+ Rxh7 20 Jtxh7+ >8?xh7 (when Nd2-el will pick up Black's pawn on g3 quickly and efficiently) and of meeting the zwischenzug 18...jS.f5 with a queen sacri- fice: 19 Qxf5! Sxf5 20 Nxf5 Rh4 21 Nh3. The attack has been halted, While's king is safe and, with rook and two bishops, White has am- ple material compensation for the queen. The problem is that Black eliminates an unfortunate number of while pawns: 21...Qxd4+ 22 -J hl Rxe5 (D). To give the reader an idea of how deep opening theory is capable of extending its ten- tacles into the middlegame (and even the end- game): this is not the final but the starting point of the theoretical discussion in this line. It is true that the theoretical assessment does not greatly differ from what every reader's first impression probably is (namely that lhe position is unclear with chances for both sides), but the amount of variations developed from this position is impressive. White starts by giving away yet another pawn for the sake of a quick development of his queenside: 23 Nd2. But no matter how spectacular and fascinat- ing these lines are, the highly specialized na- ture of them caused public interest in the Open Ruy Lopez to dwindle alarmingly between about 1950 and the late 1970s. Then in 1978 Viktor Korchnoi gave the whole variation a new lease on life. He chose the Open Ruy Lopez as his main defence against 1 e4 in two matches for the world championship against Anatoly Karpov, in 1978 and 1981, demon- strating a wealth of new ideas. For instance, he showed IL.JLfS (D) to have been a grossly underestimated move.

If 12 5)b3, Black should not play the obvious
12...Jtb6, but the surprising and very effective
12..Bg6. Taking on c5 and g6 does not harm
Black, for after 13 xcS Nxc5 14 Bxg6 fxg6 his position is fine, nor is 13 Bxe4 a problem due to 13...dxe4 14 Nxc5 Qxdl 15 Sxdl exf3. .And a deeper point of 12..Bg6 is revealed after 13 £Td4, for this gives Black the chance to play
13....1.xd4 without having lost a tempo first by
playing ...dLb6. This gives him just enough time to meet 14 cxd4 with 14...a5!, continuing 15 f3 a4. If White instead plays 15 Jke3. and meets
15...a4 with 16 <5)cl, Black has a highly promis-
ing piece sacrifice: 16...a3 17 b3 f6 18 f3 fxe5!. This variation clearly shows that a true devo- tee of the Open Ruy Lopez almost never re- treats if there is still even the faintest hope of moving forward. Always look for the most ag- gressive solution to each and every problem in this variation! In fact, this attitude may be said to reach its peak in Black's fourth option after 1 1 Bc2: ll...Nxf2. the Dilworth Attack. This line was very popular in the 1940s, then for a long time retreated to the world of correspon- dence chess, only to gain wide acceptance as a full-blown variation in recent years. Black not just exchanges two minor pieces for rook and pawn (which would be enough to create an un- balanced position in itself), he also destroys the natural cover of White's king. The main start- ing point of this line arises after 12 Exf2 f6 13 exf6 ±xf2+ 14 Nxf2 Qxf6 (D). like ...Qe5, ...Jtg4 and ...Eae8. With the mate- rial balance destroyed, this variation requires cold-bloodedness and a sense for the dynamic aspects of chess from both players. 9 bd2 9 < bd2(D) This move was thought to be completely harmless for a very long time. Although ordi- nary developing moves like 9...Be7 and 9...Bc5 were always recognized as a little bit risky be- cause of 10 <Lxe4 (though in fact recent at- tempts to turn 9...Ac5 10 '?)xe4 into a playable variation have been fairly successful), tradi- tional theory maintained that Black has one to- tally reliable reply to 9 ?)bd2: 9 ...

With this fearless advance. Black opens up the centre and seeks to take the initiative. This prevents White from playing 5kl4, a blockad- ing move that featured so prominently in the 9 c3 variation. By way of comparison: after
10...'2)xb3 1 1 ?)xb3 it is White who has the ini-
tiative and a firm grip on the vital squares c5 and d4. An alternative that is much stronger than
10...Q)xb3 and of approximately the same value
as 10...d4 is 10...±g4, which does take up the fight for control over d4 and which hinders White's natural development. In 1981, during the second of the aforemen- tioned matches for the world championship. Black has a huge lead in development and is threatening to intensify the pressure with moves

<?3bd2 seemed about to be abandoned, until it gradually became clear where the real problem with 10...d4 lies. When Karpov played the astounding 11 <Ng5 (D) against Korchnoi in 1978, he naturally had the world shell-shocked for a while (not to mention his opponent!). Karpov scored two resounding victories from the position after 10...d4. As a result. 9 £fbd2 became enormously popular. First, it was Kar- pov's strictly positional approach from 1981, starting with 11 Nxe6, that attracted people. Remarkably, and perhaps as a result of the ever-increasing calculating powers of the com- puter (which began to play a serious role in opening preparation in the mid-1990s), it was only after this first wave of popularity died down that the far sharper move which had been played by Karpov in his first world champion- ship match (in 1978), finally managed to catch the public eye, viz. the incredible 11 52g5. It is this move that now constitutes one of the biggest problems for lovers of the Open Ruy Lopez and which provides theoreticians with one of their greatest challenges. After 11 Nxe6 Nxe6 12 cxd4 Ncxd4, ev- erything looks fine for Black. His knights are actively posted and there are hardly any weak- nesses in his pawn-chain. But in 1981 Karpov, with his characteristic merciless accuracy, dem- onstrated that White's tiny lead in development and his space advantage on the kingside do promise him chances of obtaining the initiative. Both 13 a4 and 13 Ne4 Jke7 14 Jte3 brought him success. But in the years following this match Black's defences were strengthened and after a while it became clear that there was no real danger for Black in this line, provided he knows his theory. For instance, in the latter variation (after 14 Ae3) 14...$)f5 turned out to be much stronger than Korchnoi's move 14...Qxf3+. The entire 9 But although the correctness of this move was immediately recognized, surprisingly it failed to attract the huge following that one would be inclined to expect. The reason may have been that Karpov did not in the end win this game, or perhaps the world was not ready yet for a revolution of the kind that such a move entails. The point of 1 1 Ng5 is that after H...Qxg5 White plays 12 Bf3!, when the most obvious way to protect the knight on c6 fails to achieve its purpose: after 12...Qd7? 13 Ad5! Black is in serious trouble. 12..Bd7 13 jlxf7+ Ne7 is less clear but obviously risky. The best-established line is the cunning 12...O-O-O 13 Axe6+fxe6 ]4 Qxc6 Qxe5. This position is regarded as criti- cal for a correct evaluation of 1 l...Rxg5. The resolute 15 b4 in particular has been the sub- ject of detailed analysis extending many moves ahead. Black also faces a practical problem after 1 1 4Bg5 in that there is no emergency exit, no way to avoid these unfathomable complications. For a long time it was thought the way in which Korchnoi had managed to rescue himself in 1978 was such an escape-route: ll...dxc3 12 <2)xe6fxe6 13bxc3 'd3 (D).

challenging variations in the whole of opening theory. To begin with, White again has to decide how to protect e4. The implications of 6 d3, 6 £k3, 6 Re2 and 6 d4 are all very similar to 5 d3, 5 £k3, etc., which I discussed briefly on pages 280-2. Strictly speaking, all of these moves could be said to be slightly more precise at move six, because Black has already com- mitted himself to a ...Bc7 plan, but this advan- tage is only marginal at best and most people who play these lines do so on move five in order to avoid the Open Ruy Lopez. But compared to the situation on move five, White has two extra options: The first of these is the strange- looking 6 Jlxc6. the Steenwijk Variation. Again, the idea is not to meet 6...dxc6 with 7 Nxe5, for in that case 7...'?Bxe4 solves all Black's opening problems. The paradoxical point of this belated exchange is to play 7 d3 (D), when despite hav- ing made two extra - and normally very useful - developing moves (4...<2)f6 and 5...Ne7), Black has more problems protecting e5 than in the Exchange Variation. In fact it needed another historic game from a world championship match to show that here too Black is walking into a minefield. In 1995, Kasparov played 14 Bc2 'xc3 15 Nb3! in this position against Anand. This is the sort of move that shocks a human being into silence but makes a computer run even faster. White sacri- fices a whole rook (15...QKb3 16 Jlxb3 Qxal) in order to keep Black's king trapped in the cen- tre. And whether Black accepts the sacrifice or not, he suddenly finds himself in an extremely dangerous situation. Ever since this game, any- one interested in playing this variation must really know what he is doing. Closed Variation 5 ... Be7 (D) Tf 7...Ag4. for instance, the reply 8 h3 forces Black to take on f3, because after 8... .h5 9 g4 he simply loses a pawn. But after 8...Bxf3 9 Qxf3 Black has given up his bishop-pair, which is one of his main trumps in almost any varia- tion where White takes on c6.
7...Rd6 too becomes decidedly less attrac-
tive now that 8 Nbd2 immediately confronts Black with the threat of 9 £}c4. A simple developing move, yet it is the start- ing point for some of the most complex and
288 FUNDAMENTAL CHESS OPENINGS
Therefore by far the most accepted reply to
7 d3 is 7...?)d7, which though solid enough in
itself, does have the disadvantage of making Black's further piece development a bit diffi- cult. Theory concentrates mainly on the posi- tion after 8 ?jbd2 O-O 9 <Nc4 f6, with 10 )h4 <5 c5 as one of the main lines. The second is a move that was not possible before:

position fundamentally, not just because the possibility of .xc6+ is disabled, but because Black has gained space on the queenside - space that can be used for a developing move like ...Ji.b7 or for further aggression with ...Na5 followed by ...c5. Black has made it clear that he has no wish to leave the initiative on the queenside to his opponent. As a rule, the Closed Variation leads to a positionally complex middlegame. 8 c3 I have already explained some of the impli- cations of this move in the section on the Neo- Steinitz (see page 278). White makes sure that his bishop is not going to be exchanged by ...Na5 and is preparing to advance in the centre with d4. The immediate 8 d4 would run into
8... xd4 9 Qxd4 exd4 10 Qxd4?? c51, when
11 ...c4 traps the bishop. If White is looking for an alternative to 8 c3, he has a much sounder option in 8 a4. This is an attempt to take immediate advantage of the one (potential) drawback of ...b5. This line became popular around 1990, though it never managed to surpass 8 c3 as the main line. As a positional motif, a4 plays a crucial role in the Closed Ruy Lopez: it is White's chief method of fighting back on the queenside. However, most players do not wish to play this trump card so early in the game. The critical replies are 8...b4 and 8...jLg4.
8 ... O-O (D)
9 h3 This move looks very slow at first sight, al- most irresponsibly so in fact. Black has practi- cally completed his development, while White's There are two main lines in this position. By playing 7...d6, Black finally indicates that he is heading for a closed type of position. 7...O-O. on the other hand, is a necessary preliminary to the renowned Marshall Attack.
7...d6
7 ... d6 (D) Black chooses the same type of defensive formation as in the Neo-Steinitz, the insertion of ...b5 being the only difference. Insignificant though this addition may seem, it changes the RlJY LOPEZ 289 counterattack as fast as possible, starting, for instance, with 1 l...c6. We now return to 9 h3 (D): entire queenside has not even begun to get started, but instead of hurrying up a bit, White calmly makes another preparatory move for d4 (eliminating the reply ...Jfg4). However, this lit- tle move turns out to be a golden investment. White's position is like a sleeping giant. Well and truly awakened, it will be a tremendous force, but when clumsily trying to get up too soon, it will be vulnerable to a sharp counterat- tack (which is what variations like the Marshall Attack are based on). As we shall see, once the giant awakens, it is very difficult for Black to hold him in check and this is really the funda- mental problem of the Closed Ruy Lopez: how to develop counierplay once White has 'safely' played d4. It has been said that a player has not truly mastered the game until he knows how to handle this opening as Black. Notwithstanding all this, the immediate 9 d4 is a perfectly legitimate alternative to 9 h3. especially for those with a dynamic and ag- gressive style and with little patience for the subtleties involved in 9 h3. After 9...J.g4 there are two main lines (not counting 10 h3 Jixf3, when White must choose between the radier speculative pawn sacrifice 1 1 Qxf3 exd4 and the positionally suspect 1 1 gxf.3). The first is to protect d4 with 10 Be3, which is possible because 10...<5)xe4?? loses a piece to 1 1 Bd5. After 10...exd4 1 1 cxd4, Black will at- tempt to take the initiative, for instance with U...d5 12 e5 -Sie4 or 11...2>a5 12 i_c2 c5 (or
12...&C4).
The second is to close the centre with 10 d5 '21a5 11 ±c2. Here too Black will want to This is the starting position for a great num- ber of well-analysed variations. I shall elabo- rate three of them, starting with Black's oldest move, 9...Na5, the Chigorin Defence. Then comes 9...Nb8, the Breyer Defence, which was tremendously popular in the 1960s and 1970s and is still considered critical today. The third is 9... .b7, the Zaitsev Variation, which completely dominated the tournament arena in the 1980s. Of Black's remaining options, I shall just briefly mention the three most impoilant ones:
9...h6, 9...€ld7 and 9...Ne6.
9...h6, the Smyslov Variation, prepares
10...2e8 by preventing g5. This variation had
its heyday before the rise of the Zaitsev Varia- tion, which showed that Black does not have to worry about this knight sortie. The idea of 9../z3d7 is to regroup with moves like ...Nb6 and ... .16. This variation has no generally accepted name (though those of Keres and Karpov have been associated with it) but it does have a good reputation (which is of course much more important).
9...Be6 also goes through life without a
proper name, even though it has a good reputa- tion and was favoured by world champion Bot- vinnik. amongst others. Critical is 10 d4 .xb3 1 1 axb3 exd4 12 cxd4 d5 13 e5 Ne4 14 <2)c3, and in particular the pawn sacrifice 14...f5 15 exf6 Bxf6!? 16 )xe4dxe4 17Sxe4Wd5. Does
290 FUNDAMENTAL CHESS OPENINGS
Black's active play compensate for the missing pawn or not? That is the question. Chigorin Defence as a base for counterplay. But in that case Black has to be aware of a possible boomer- ang effect, for if White manages to neutralize any short-term threats, he has every chance of taking over control of the c-file with good prospects of even taking over the initiative on the queenside in the longer run. 11 ... Rc7 The classical move in this position, yet there are some trustworthy alternatives, most notably 1 l...£3d7 and 1 l...Jfb7. The latter move is made possible by the tactical blow 12 dxe5 dxe5 13 Rxd8 5axd8 14 <5)xe5 .xe4!. After 15 .xe4 £t'.xe4. 16 Hxe4? is bad due to 16...Edl+, when Black wins back the sacrificed piece. 12 5)bd2 (D) Players with a marked preference for a closed centre will want to play 12 d5 right away. Al- though this is certainly not bad (even quite pop- ular in fact), 'official' opening theory will never approve of immediately carrying out a plan, however good, without giving very careful con- sideration to the matter of timing. Always wait for the best possible moment! By playing 12 Cibd? White wants to develop his queenside first, beginning with the knight, for which W 1 and then either to e3 or g3 is clearly indicated.
[diagram]
Unlike 5...Na5 in the Taimanov Variation (see page 277), this move is not intended to ex- change the bishop (for White is almost certain to reply 10 Bc2). but to make way for the c-pawn. 10 ±c2 cS 11 d4(D) At last the opposing pawn armies make con- tact. From now on, the fundamental problem for White will be whether to exchange on e5 (or c5) or to close the centre with d5, and for Black whether to take on d4. In the majority of cases this is an extremely subtle evaluation, which usually depends on personal preference as much as on objective positional factors. Speaking in a general sense, one could make the following observations though: • Exchanging on e5 becomes a serious option if there is any way in which White can make use of the d5-square, for instance with the manoeuvre Qbd2-f1-e3-d5. This was thought to be White's principal strategy in the 1950s and 1960s. • After about 1970 the (older) plan of playing d5 received a lot of attention. White closes the centre, hoping that this will free his hands for an attack on the kingside. • With the above in mind, it may seem logical for Black to play ...cxd4, opening the c-file A veritable wealth of variations has been de- veloped from this position. They are all very much alike, and in order to understand them properly, one will have to study them all! Let us first look at Black's most radical op- tion: 12...cxd4, Black cuts the Gordian Knot by opening the c-file immediately. After 1 3 cxd4
RUY LOPEZ 291
he has several ways to try to take the initiative on the queenside. The most obvious is perhaps to play 13...jLb7, but if one studies the Chigorin deeply it will be- come clear that there is a downside even to this seemingly natural developing move. As long as its diagonal remains open, this bishop is very well placed indeed, but if White plays d5 the situation changes dramatically. Now, the vari- ation 12...cxd4 13 cxd4 Bb7 is not without some finer points. In the first place: if 14 Nfl. the advance ...d5 becomes an option. Black will reply 14...2ac8, whereupon 15 #)e3 fails to 15...Nxe4! and every other move - 15 JLbl ,
15 Jld3 and 15 2e2 - can be met by 15...d51?
with great complications that need to be exam- ined very thoroughly. Theory has been working on this since 1908(1) and still has not come up with a clear judgement. Secondly, if 14 d5 Black has the sharp 14...Sac8 15 Bd3 Nd7 16

side and attacking e4, Black undermines the d5-pawn and keeps his queen's bishop in play. A second way of justifying the exchange on d4 with active play starts with 13...?)c6 (D). than with the bishop at b7 and the knight stranded on a5. The main line is 14 Nb3. This rather pro- vokes 14...a5, but White has just enough time to develop his bishop (15 Jte3) so as to meet
15.,.a4 with 16 Qbd2 (D). This is the main
starting point of this variation. Black has gained space on the queenside, but White has managed to consolidate his centre and complete his development. From all of the subvariations of the Chigorin, this is both one of the oldest and one of the most topical. Finally, the flexible 13...jLd7 is often played. In this case 14 Nfl Sac 8 15 5)e3 and now
15... 3c6 is considered critical.
So much for 12...cxd4. Let us see now if there is any sense in carrying out the above plans without capturing on d4 first. The immediate 12...£te6 actually was one of the most important variations of the entire Ruy Lopez until about 1970. Since 13 Nb3 is hardly attractive with a black pawn on c5 and 13 Nfl is (again) met by 13...cxd4 14 cxd4 Nxd4. it was assumed for decades that this was a posi- tion where 13 dxc5 dxc5 14 5jf I is White's best plan. This variation was analysed very deeply, with the position after 14..Be6 15 ?)e3 Had8
16 Re2 c4 taking most of the limelight.
Then, around 1970 a reassessment of the old
13 d5 plan took place. It turned out that White's
chances in this type of position had been rather underestimated. Not only does White have prospects of an attack on the kingside, based on g4 and <2)fl-g3, but he might even take the meet I4...Nxd4 15 )xd4exd4 with 16' 'xd4?? because the c2-bishop is left en prise.

initiative on the queenside with a4. Although Black's position will always be very solid, en- thusiasm for 12...£}c6 cooled down somewhat and nowadays this variation is seen very little. The same can be said about 12..Jstb7. This line was thought to be practically identical to its twin variation 12...cxd4 13 cxd4 Jlb7 fora very long time, but here too the renaissance of 1 3 d5 has taken its toll. In this type of position. b7 is simply not a good square for Black's bishop. Nowadays, it is 12... .d7 that is the most im- portant non-12...cxd4 variation. With the bishop on d7, 13 d5 is not particularly to be feared (a good reply being 13...c4 14 'S'lfl ''7tb7 fol- lowed by ...#Bc5). If 13 £rfl on the other hand.

Black's knight will be useful and flexible on d7. • The advance ...c5, which is another character- istic of the Chigorin Defence, also has its cons as well as its pros. It is a useful territorial ex- pansion on the queensidc but it does allow White to establish a very stable space advan- tage by playing d5 at some point. By keeping the c-pawn back for the time being, Black re- tains the chance of meeting d5 with ...c6, at- tacking White's central pawn-formation. The question remains of course whether

To begin with. 12 d5 does not make much sense in this position, since 12...cb (or 12..,Nc5 13 Bc2 cb) forces White to ex- change pawns on c6, when Black's pieces are very actively posted. Another strong point of Black's opening scheme is that the much-desired manoeuvre <2hf I-g3 is not so easy to carry out, because e4 has to be protected. 12 i.c2 Once we begin to understand that White has nothing better than this voluntary retreat (that is. without being forced to do so by ...>2Ba5), it Anyone seeing this move for the first time might well get the impression that Black is ac- tually setting up the pieces for a new game. What else can be the point of a seemingly to- tally useless move like this? Nevertheless, the Breyer is one of Black's very best options in this position. The underly- ing motifs are not easy to spot, yet a comparison with the Chigorin Defence may be revealing: • It is true that 9...Na5 gains a tempo, but in it- self a5 is not a very good square for the

14 £'g3 g6 (D) Nowadays, White is searching for alterna- tive methods. The most popular of the new vari- ations is 15 b3. White simply wants to cany out the classical plan of playing d5. By preparing to meet ...c6 with the supportive c4, he avoids having to exchange on c6. Zaitsev Variation 9 ... Nb7 (D) This is a key position of the Breyer. Black's last move is intended to prevent a future £jf5 and introduces the possibility of playing ...Jig7.
15 d5 is still not to be feared because of 15...c6.
Not only does White now have to take a possi- ble ...c5 into account, but he also has to be wary of a frontal attack in the centre with ...d5. What should he do? The classical answer to this question is 15 a4. This is a subtle and logical move. White takes advantage of the opportunity offered by Black's apparent lack of interest in queenside expansion by taking the initiative on that wing himself. If
15...Jtg7, the idea is to play 16 JoLd3, inducing
the small but important concession 16...c6, which blocks the diagonal of Black's queen's bishop and in consequence relieves the pressure on e4. But the downside of 15 a4 is that it makes
15...c5 attractive again, for 16 d5 c4 now offers
Black an unassailable strongpoint for his knight on c5. If, for instance, 17 Jtc3 4)c5 taking on c5 is unattractive, while - having played a4 - White is no longer in a position to drive away the knight with 18 b4 cxb3 19 axb3 followed by b4. This move became exceedingly popular af- ter World Champion Anatoly Karpov 'inher- ited' it from his long-time coach and second Igor Zaitsev in the late 1970s, scoring some magnificent victories. It is a sort of restyling of the idea behind the Breyer Defence. The knight on c6 remains in place, but the pressure on e4 is increased all the same. There is. however, one very odd thing about the Zaitsev which makes it unfit to be used on all occasions. 10 (14 Ne8 This is the point of Black's previous move. Surprisingly, Black does not need to worry about 11 <21g5, since after the laconic reply 1 1...Sf8 White appears to have no way of backing up the aggressive knight sortie. Naturally, however. White may retreat the knight (12 W3) and in so doing invite Black to repeat moves (12...fie8 13 Ng5, etc.). Paradoxically then, this line, which is one of the most complex and dynamic of the entire Ruy Lopez, can only be played by some- one who is prepared to accept a most ignomini- ous draw by repetition in the opening. 11 a4(D)

Now 12 d5 would be less effective. Black's best reply is probably 12... )a5 13 Ac2 c6. The fact that White cannot play Bg5 seriously ham- pers him in his struggle for d5.

If White simply develops according to the well-known pattern of 11 Qbd2 Jlf8 12 -Nc2 g6, he faces a problem: the standard continua- tion 13 Wl would be too slow, for it allows Black to play 13...exd4 14 cxd4 Nb4, forcing the exchange of this knight for the 'Spanish' bishop on c2, thus decidedly lessening White's attacking chances. For this reason. 13 d5 is usu- ally played. After 13...<?be7 or 13...Nb8 White then has 14 b3 c6 15 c4, consolidating his stronghold at d5. This line illustrates the pros and cons of the Zaitsev rather well. Black puts pressure on e4 without having to play ...<2)b8-d7. but the cru- cial plan of playing d5 (supported by b3 and c4 if necessary) becomes more attractive with a knight on c6. This is a crucial position strategically. White is poised to take the initiative on the queenside with moves like Jtd3 or d5 in combination with b3 and c4. Black has several ways to counter this plan, but he can also alter the position dramati- cally by making use of the one drawback of a4: 13 ... exd4 14 cxd4 Nb4 We have seen this knight move before, viz. in the variation 1 1 Nbd2 Af8 1 2 Nc2 g6 1 3 Nfl . Then, it was a tactical stroke intended to elimi- nate White's bishop-pair. Here, the idea is a strategic one. Now that White can no longer play a3. Black's b4-knight is unassailable. The crucial question is: is this really the right mo- ment for an all-out attack against White's cen- tre pawns, or is giving up the central stronghold at e5 too high a price? The critical position arises after the follow- ing moves:

countered with extreme vigilance. The threat oi ...c4 followed by ...Nc5 and an invasion by the knights on d3 looms large over White's queen- side. and on the kingside a well-timed ...f5 might destroy White's entire pawn-centre. This is an extremely explosive situation, ask- ing the utmost of both players. Some unbeliev- ably complicated games have been played with this line, with sometimes White showing true virtuosity in making use of his attacking chances on the kingside, and sometimes Black wiping out the enemy position without any problems. While's best move is thought to be 17 Sa3. The idea is to transfer the rook to the kingside via e3, f3 or g3. If 17...c4 White intends to play 18 <£<14 or 18 axb5 axb5 19 2>d4. If 17..T5 both 18 exf5 and 18 Nh2 (freeing the way for the rook to f3 or g3) have been played. In the latter variation White concentrates all his forces against Black's king. Marshall Attack
7 ... O-O(D)
This seemingly innocuous move is in fact the preliminary to a pawn sacrifice which com- pletely changes the hitherto closed character of the position. 8 c3 White continues with the same plan as against
7...d6. Black must now either revert to standard
main lines of the Closed Ruy Lopez that we have just examined by playing 8...d6, or else make the characteristic pawn sacrifice of the Marshall Attack. Tn order to prevent Black's next move, alter- natives to 8 c3 have been thoroughly exam- ined, much more so than after 7. ..d6. Perhaps the most important one is 8 a4 (other possibili- ties are 8 d3 and 8 h3),which is more pointed after 7. ..O-O (as compared to 7...d6), because Black cannot reply with the aggressive 8...jLg4. This move often leads to a rather slow opening phase with White playing d3 rather than d4. This can be frustrating to a player who is men- tally geared for the totally different type of play arising in the Marshall Attack. An impor- tant starting position for this line arises after

It is the great merit of Frank Marshall (1877- 1944), one of the best players in the world dur- ing the first half of the 20th century, to have discovered how powerful this courageous treat- ment of the opening really is, but his gambit did not become truly popular until after World War II. Nowadays it is one of the most heavily analysed opening variations in chess and accu- rate theoretical knowledge is an absolute re- quirement if one is to play this gambit with any degree of success. But it is by no means a matter of just learning variations by heart. Theory of the Marshall is very much alive and is being refined and enriched with new ideas almost every day. The bulk of these variations start with... 9 exd5 <7)xd5

11 2xe5 c6 (D) ll...?)f6 and H...jLb7 are major alterna- tives, but 1 1 ,..c6 is the main line. Black is ready to start an attack against White's king with ...Ad6 and ...Rh4. White will have to defend against this, while at the same time making sure that his queenside forces wake up before it is too late. w This position illustrates the character of the Marshall Attack very well. White's position is not exactly bad, but he will have to work hard to catch up on his piece development and for the moment his extra pawn has no significance. An opponent with a good eye for attacking chances is likely to put no end of obstacles in his way.
15 Jle3 is the traditional move. Black then
continues 15-.fi.g4 and after 16 Rd3 he has
16...5ac8 17 Nd2 and now 17...f5 or 17...2e6,
to name just a few of the more characteristic ideas. In order to prevent this easy attacking plan, the ingenious 15 2e4 has been tried. This pre- vents Black from playing 15- Ag4 and gives him the opportunity of blundering his queen by 15-.fi.f5?? 16Sh4. After the equally ingenious
15...g5 (based on 16 Axg5?? Rf5) this too
leads to a fierce and unpredictable battle. Arkhangelsk Variation 5 ... b5 We have seen this move being played in dif- ferent circumstances and for various reasons. In this case the idea is to carry out a plan that we have not seen before, one that is relatively new, at least in a 'Ruy Lopez' context. Before 1970 it was hardly ever seen in grandmaster games. Nowadays, it is one of the main lines and it has produced some offspring of its own. the Neo- Arkhangelsk (which we shall be looking at shortly). Even the much older and almost for- gotten 5-.fi.c5 has been dug out and given a new lease on life. This used to be called Moller 12 d4 The most natural move and also the main line, but there are several alternatives, some of them very subtle indeed, for instance 12 d3, 12 £el and 12 Axd5. 12 ...

Variation, but now that it is being played with a wholly different idea, a name like Ultra-Neo- Arkhangelsk or Turbo-Arkhangelsk would perhaps be more appropriate. After 5....&C5 6 c3, Black intends to continue 6...b5 (the old Moller idea was to play 6...Ba7), when 7 Jcb3 d6 brings about a Neo-Arkhangelsk. By choos- ing this subtle move-order Black has avoided the tricky line 5...b5 6 Nb3 i.c5 7 a4 Nb7 8 d3 followed by 9 Nc3. Those who want to contest the soundness of this Turbo-Arkhangelsk Variation will proba- bly want to meet 5... .c5 6 c3 b5 with 7 jic2 in- stead of 7 jib3.

Ironically, the success of 6...jLc5 (D). the Neo-Arkhangelsk. is due to it being much more solid and less dependent on razor-sharp varia- tions that need to be calculated extremely accu- rately.

By delaying ...Xb7, Black gives himself just enough time to meet 7 c3 with 7...d6 8 d4 Bb6, consolidating his central pawn-formation. This has the added advantage that Black can now play the aggressive ...Jlg4 in some positions, instead of the 'traditional' Arkhangelsk move ,.J.b7. Tactically, the Neo-Arkhangelsk is made pos- sible by the fact that 7 4Bxe5 Q)xe5 8 d4 is not as promising for White as it may look. Black cold- bloodedly replies 8...Jlxd4 9 Rxd4 d6 (threat- ening to win a piece by 10...c5 and ll...c4), when after 10 c3 O-O followed by ...aLb7 and ...c5 Black achieves a satisfactory position. Two lines have shown themselves as critical tests for the soundness of the Neo-Arkhangelsk, both of them involving an attack against b5. The first is 7 c3 d6 8 a4; the second is 7 a4. In the latter case, 7...Jkb7 8 d3 d6 9 Qc3 brings about the position that the Turbo-Arkhangelsk,
5...Bc5, is designed to avoid.
Berlin Defence 3 ... Nf6 (D) This natural move is less flexible than 3...a6

has aroused a great deal of enthusiasm in recent years. The 'classical' Arkhangelsk Variation now continues with6...Xb7, The Neo-Arkhangelsk, which has been very popular since 1994, starts with 6..Jtc5, The older move. 6...Bb7, is the sharper of the two. Even the solid reply 7 Eel leads to a highly complex middlegame after 7...Ac5 8 c3 d6 9 d4 jLb6 and now. for instance, 10 Bg5 (a logical move in itself, now that Black's king's bishop is not at its usual post e7, but risky nev- ertheless) 10...h6 11 Nh4 to!? 12 a4 O-O-O, followed by ...g5 and ...h5. Even more unfath- omable are the consequences of 7 c3. This move gives Black no time to play both ...Jic5 and ...d6, so 7..Bc5 8 d4 is good for White. But Black does have the cold-blooded, materi- alistic 7...Nxe4 8 d4 Na5 9 Jlc2 exd4. This is a true all-or-nothing variation and it requires some theoretical knowledge from both sides.

4 O-O
Castling is by far the most popular move and theoretically the critical reply. White has the same range of options that he has after 3...a6 4 jLa4 4df6, viz. 4 d3. 4 d4. 4 S'eZ and 4 c3 (which in this case is a direct transposition to the Four Knights Game; see page 319) and even
4 Jlxc6 has been played, but theory has little to
say on any of these. 4 ... Qxe4 Another option is to steer the opening toward a Steinitz Variation with 4...d6; for instance, 5 d4 Ad7 6 ?jc3 exd4 7 Qxd4 Ne7 (see page 272). In fact, this may well be a more accurate move-order than the traditional 3...d6, since White has already castled kingside, while in the Steinitz proper, castling queenside is often a powerful move.
4...Ae7 and 4...Bc5 are perfectly legal as
well, but they are far less popular (and conse- quently less heavily analysed) than their 3...a6
4 Na4 counterparts. Critical for 4...jlc5 is the
position after 5 c3 O-O 6 d4 atb6. 5 d4(Z>) Just like in the Open Ruy Lopez, other ways of recapturing the pawn, like 5 Jixc6 or 5 Sei QSd6 6 £txe5 Jke7. are too modest to trouble Black. By playing 5 d4, White aims to develop his pieces as aggressively as possible. How- ever, frustrating this aggression is precisely what Black's opening play in this line is all about. 5 ... *21d6 If the moves 3...a6 4 Jla4 had been inserted, Black would not have this attack on the bishop. The opening now takes on a rather unique char- acter. Not only in the Ruy Lopez, but in the whole of opening theory there is no parallel for what happens next.

Exchanging queens seems logical since Black now loses the right to castle, but the downside is that it does relieve the pressure on Black's rather cramped position. In fact 8 Qe2. to keep the queens on the board, would be a major op- tion if Black did not have the tactical reply

solves all his problems neatly and efficiently. 8 ... Nxd8 (D) In a period of just a few years, this position has turned into a nightmare for the true 1 e4 player, that is the healthy and energetic player who was hoping for an honest, straightforward
RUY LOPEZ 299
attacking game. The variation is actually very old. but until recently it was hardly ever played. Opening manuals usually repeated the intimi- dating (but utterly meaningless) remark that White has a slight advantage. The problem is that it is very difficult to say what White should do in this position. And if you do not have a good plan, then the theoretical assessment that you are supposed to stand slightly better is just a source of frustration. For this reason the variation has often been referred to as the Berlin Wall in recent years. Black's position is a little cramped, but is with- out weaknesses and in the long run his pair of bishops might start dictating the course of events. Black cannot castle but it turns out that this is not much of a problem. His king may move to c8 or e8 and without queens on the board, creating anything even vaguely resem- bling an attack on the king is going to be a tall order for White.
9 Nc3
After this standard developing move, Black has tried a number of plans. 9...Ae6 looks natu- ral but has the drawback of inviting 10 4t)g5, which eliminates the bishop-pair. As a prepara- tory move, both 9...h6 and 9...3?e8 have been tried. After these variations had been popular a few years, it became clear that 9...Jld7, en- abling Black to play ...'A-c8. is also a serious op- tion. Even the unbelievably artificial 9...Ne7 is an important option. Black manoeuvres the knight to g6 and opens the way for his queen's bishop to f5 or g4. In almost all of these cases, White will have to start a long-term offensive on the kingside sooner or later. By advancing his f- and g- pawns (f4 and g4) he gains space, but Black will be on the lookout to strike back with a well-timed ...h5. This is a variation that requires positional in- sight and a lot of patience from both players. The single-minded attacking player is likely to feel extremely unhappy here. Schliemann Defence (or Jaenisch Gambit) This variation is intended to create a direct and highly tactical confrontation in the centre. It has shown itself to be attractive not just to good tacticians, but also to lovers of thorough and exact opening preparation - good analysts. It is not a coincidence that it is (co-)named after Carl Jaenisch (1813-72), who was the first to publish an extensive analysis of this line, but who never was a great player.
4 Nc3
The first point of 3...f5 is that 4 exfS is met by 4...e4, when White does not really have a good square for his knight. 5 Qe2 Qc7 6 Bxc6 dxc6 7 <2)d4 Re5 cannot exactly be called a ref- utation of Black's gambit.

The solid 4 <13 is also a perfectly logical re- ply to 3...f5, but not really enough to worry Black. After 4...fxe4 5 dxe4 Nf6 6 O-O Black used to play 6...d6, protecting c5, but nowadays the aggressive 6...Nc5 is the main line. If White accepts the pawn sacrifice, Black gets plenty of counterplay after 7 Bxc6 bxc6 8 £txe5 O-O, thanks to his lead in development. It turns out then to be not so easy to find a weak spot in the Schliemann Defence. By play- ing 4 £te3, White accepts the challenge to a fierce struggle. Black is forced to commit him- self even further. 4 ... fxe4 5 <2)xe4 (D) If 7...bxc6?, then 8 Jlxc6+ .d7 9 Rh5+ would force him to play 9...'S'e7, when 10 Re5+ Ne6 1 1 Nxa8 Rxa8 12 Qxc7+ Ne8 13 O-O is very good for White. And what options does Black have? He is already a pawn down and about to be hit by a catastrophic discovered check.

After 8 Re2 ?3f6 (the immediate 8...Qxg2 is weaker because of 9 Qh5+) a critical position is reached. The tricky 9 f4 is thought to be White's best move here. White sacrifices his f-pawn in orderto save his g-pawn. After 9...Rxf4, both 10 <Ne5+c6 Hd4Wh4+ 12g3Qh313±c4and 10 $Jxa7+ have been tried. 5 ... d5

Italian Game

3 ±c4 (D) on - for example - the Italian Game, probably had the impression of entering a museum. A museum of opening theory, where every dis- play case shows how openings used to be looked at in a very, very distant past. But during the 1990s this situation changed rather suddenly. With the aid of that new tool the computer, many ancient openings were ex- amined afresh with the result that some of them have been written off again (this time perhaps for good), but some have been restored to something of their former glory. In fact, we are still in the middle of this process today. Some of the old variations are still waiting for their turn. Something that has not changed though is the major subdivision between 3... .c5 and
3...Nf6. Even in the 21st century, these are the
critical tests of 3 jLc4. Anyone playing either of these moves has to be aware of the fact that he is provoking a sharp reaction. Some knowledge of the old (and the new!) variations is certainly to be recommended. For those who do not trust themselves with these lines, there is 3...jLe7 4 d4 d6. This is the old Hungarian Defence, which is not encum- bered with a lot of theory. Giuoco Piano: 3...jlc5 3 ... AcS (D) When choosing this move. Black has to be aware of a wide variety of responses by White. The classical reply is 4 c3, preparing 5 d4. Ironically it is precisely this straightforward, logical variation that nowadays most closely re- sembles a museum artefact. 4 b4, the Evans Gambit, appeared to be des- tined for a similar fate, but this remarkable and in the eyes of a modem player probably highly dubious pawn sacrifice experienced a true re- naissance in the 1990s, when even world cham- pion Garry Kasparov adopted it. For centuries, 3 Bc4 was so self-evident a move that it was not thought necessary to give it a name, like 1 e4 also has no name. Names were only given after 3 jic4, in order to distinguish between Black's major replies. 3...Bc5 was called the Giuoco Piano and 3...?)f6 the Two Knights Defence. The mere fact that in this book I follow the modern trend by lumping them together and calling 3 Jlc4 the Italian Game, is sadly illus- trative of the diminished importance of this opening. Ever since the second half of the 19th century, the Ruy Lopez has been the dominant opening against I...e5. Very little fresh energy was invested in the alternatives and opening books were inclined to condense what once was a veritable jungle of deeply-analysed variations into a few shallow standard lines. As a result, much of the old 1 e4 e5 theory has been fossil- ized. Many variations were simply no longer developed from the moment when they fell out of favour (which in many cases was as early as the 19th century). Until very recently, many ac- tive tournament players, upon reading a book

Then there is 4 Qc3 Qf6 5 d3 (or 4 d3 "Sf6 5 £fc3), equally ancient but much more solid and therefore always moderately popular though never a big hit. This is called the Giuoco Pia- nissimo (meaning 'Very Quiet Game'), clearly indicating that this is not 'the way of the despiser of material'. A modern variation on this theme is to com- bine d3 with c3. This idea may look innocent, but it is in fact quite venomous. It was this line that was responsible for a first revival of the Italian Game during the 1980s. It can be played in a large number of move-orders. I shall take 4 d3 as the starting point, although 4 O-O and 4 c3 are perfectly sound and equally popular alter- natives.

In fact, this important theme is a recurrent one throughout the Italian Game and many of the other 1 e4 e5 openings. The pawn sacrifice 6 O-O, analogous to the line 4...' 'e7 5 d4 exd4 above, is less powerful here, though it certainly remains an option. It is simply that ...W6 is more useful than ...Re7 in this type of position.

In the latter case, the question is whether b4 is a useful extra step forward on lhe The story ol this position is the story of chess in a nutshell. As early as the 16th century (and
ITALIAN GAME 303
zossibly even earlier) this was a hotly-debated 7?sition. At first the tone of these discussions was rather positive as regards to White's pros- ' ects, which is understandable if we realize that they concentrated on whether, after the double pawn sacrifice 7 Nc3 IRjxe4 8 O-O 9 bxc3 i_xc3, White's quickest way of demolishing the enemy position was 10 Aa3 or 10 Rb3. But Black's defences were considerably strengthened when it was discovered first that a..,d5! is a much better move than9... ,xc3 and second that 8..JL xc3 (instead of 8...Nxc3) is a major option for in that case 9 bxc3 d5! nips White's attack in the bud. But at that point the line was given a fresh impetus by the discovery of the truly astonishing 9 d5 ' (D). But although this meant that the classical treatment of the Giuoco Piano was saved, it also meant that its fate was sealed. For where once the greatest minds in the world of chess had delved into the inexhaustible riches of 7 Q)c3, modern-day students take note of the matter- of-fact statement that 7 jld2 i.xd2+ 8 ?)bxd2 d5 9 exd5 Nxd5 probably gives White little and move on to the next chapter.

Evans Gambit
4 b4 (D)
We now enter a world that must seem unreal, perhaps fairylike, to a modern chess-player. And this is hardly surprising for we are moving back more than a century and a half in time. Invented by Captain William Evans (1790-1872) and popularized by the famous matches between Labourdonnais and McDonnell in 1834. the Ev- ans Gambit held the honorary title of 'queen of openings' for at least half a century'. "This mag- nificent attacking game was invented to make man understand that chess is a gift from the gods" wrote Savielly Tartakower. But even the Evans Gambit disappeared at the end of the 19th century, not so much for concrete reasons but rather as a natural result of the major changes in positional thinking of that era, when chess was transformed into the rational game we know today. Gone were the interest in and the in- tuitive understanding of the imaginative and op- portunistic playing style that had marked chess in the 19th century and gone were the openings that expressed these ideals most clearly. This position played a pivotal role in the Giuoco Piano during the greater part of the 19th and some of the 20th century. It was analysed in enormous depth, with subvariations which an opening manual as far back as 1938 already re- gretted to have to summarize in a mere three pages. To give the reader an impression: after

13 'S'.xgS O-O (with 13...h6 an important alter- native) the discussion focuses on the knight sacrifice 14 Nxh7. The more difficult it became to justify the ancient move 7 <2103, the more the alternative 7 Bd2 (D) came to the fore as being both more modem and more reliable. White does not sacrifice a pawn here, for

But it should not come as a big surprise that a full century later the Evans Gambit was redis- covered. In a time when traditional and dog- matic views are being challenged (and being overthrown in many cases) chess-players can be expected to be receptive to the beauty of the Evans Gambit once more. where theoretical discussions had to start. An- derssen for one thought that White should play
9 d5 here, but first Morphy and later Chigorin
considered 9 4bc3 to be the critical line.
5...Be7 6 d4 ?)a5 is a variation dating from
and characteristic of the many years when the Evans Gambit was but a shadow of its former self. The idea is to meet 7 Nxe5 with 7...Nxc4 8 £txc4 d5, simplifying the position and pro- ducing a type of position which is easily man- ageable and more or less equal. A handy line to have ready for those who are unlikely ever to face an Evans Gambit, but who do need to know something about it. But the false security offered by such a line was cruelly exposed by Garry Kasparov, when in 1995 he played, in the true spirit of the Evans. 7 , .e2 exd4 8 Rxd4. White refuses to win back the sacrificed pawn for so miserable a price and continues to play for the initiative. We now return to 5...Ba5 (D): What then is this beauty? By playing 4 b4. White offers a real gambit. He gives away a pawn, not intending to regain it quickly in one way or another, but to gain a tempo compared to the classical strategy of 4 c3 and 5 d4. It is the initiative that White is after, and he is working on the assumption that this initiative, once obtained, will more than com- pensate for the material deficit. This is to a very-' large extent a matter of per- sonal style and preference. Theory's task is to give an impartial evaluation of what is more im- portant: initiative or material. But since these are basically incompatible factors, a truly ob- jective assessment is very hard to come by. 4 ... jlxb4 Black can refuse the gambit by 4..dlb6. but although this undoubtedly keeps the position simpler, it is by no means a refutation of 4 b4.
5 c3 jLa5
Black's initial reaction was to play 5..Bc5. after which 6 d4 exd4 7 O-O! was the standard continuation and highly characteristic of the dynamic way the Evans Gambit should be treated. The position after 7...d6 8 cxd4 Bb6 was viewed as the Normal Position of the Ev- ans Gambit throughout the 19th century. This is 6 d4 The difference between 5....&C5 and 5... jla5 is that Black does not need to take on d4 now. Even so, it remains attractive to grab another pawn with 6...exd4 7 O-O and this was in fact one of the Gambit's main lines in the 19th cen- tury'. The consistent follow-up 7...dxc3 in par- ticular was very heavily analysed in those days. With the rise of modern, positional chess the more solid 6...d6 came to the fore. Instead of taking an extra one or two pawns, Black is re- turning one (7 dxe5 dxe5 8 Qxd8+ 4 xd8 9 Nxe5). Here too, the spirit of the Evans Gambit
ITALIAN GAME 305
dictates a more aggressive course, viz. 7 b3. This too has been the subject of very deep in- vestigations. Nowadays, both moves are topical once more. Ancient theoretical views are being criti- . ally examined with surprising results. Anyone ho is not averse to a little theoretical home- work, and who has a flair for tactical play, might well have some real fun with the Evans Gambit. Giuoco Pianissimo 4 c3 5 d3 If we compare this with the Evans Gambit, :his no-nonsense set-up looks very tame in- deed. But if White is determined to make the most of it, this variation offers plenty of scope. 5 ... d6 In every symmetrical position White has one weapon only: it is his move. He should play ag- gressively and force his opponent onto the de- fensive. There is only one move really which meets this requirement. 6 £ g5 (D) to a fast development. White can seek the ini- tiative with 7 Nxf6 Rxf6 8 Nd5 Rd8 9 c3 fol- lowed by d4.
6...'2)a5 is a sharper move. Nowadays White
usually responds with the quiet 7 JiLb3, possibly followed by d4, but the older and more compli- cated main lines 7 <Nd5 and 7 Jlxf6 Rxf6 8 Nd5 Rd8 9 b4 are still worthy of study.
3...Ac5 4 d3
4 d3 (D)
5 c3 Naturally, 5 Nc3 is the Giuoco Pianissimo again. With 5 c3 we are making a huge leap for- ward in time. Utterly neglected in antiquity, the idea of playing d3 and c3 became amazingly popular around 1980. It started with a few pio- neers and some surprise victories, then came a phase of general curiosity which always fol- lows success and then suddenly almost every 1 e4 player started using it. Almost overnight, this variation became the alternative to the Ruy Lopez. In fact the great attraction of this line is that White is virtually playing a Ruy Lopez, for the idea of playing d3 and c3 is a cautious yet fully realistic option in most lines of the Ruy Lopez and it does not really make a great differ- ence whether White's bishop is on b5, a4 or c4. The positional aspects and the characteristic plans remain the same. In one variation there is even a direct transposition (see the line 3...4)lf6
4 d3 Be7 on page 311).
5 ... a6 This is the starting point of this variation. Black has to find an answer to the threat of 7 4Td5. The most obvious solution is to play 6...h6. Black is hoping for 7 jLh4, when he will be able to break the pin against his knight by playing ...g5 at a moment of his own choosing. A draw- back of this method is that it does not contribute

case, after 9 £k:4 h6 10 .e3 jLxe3 1 1 fxe3, for instance, the open f-file may be useful, but White's pawn-formation has lost its flexibility. Then there is the question of an advance in the centre, d4 for White and ...d5 for Black. Whoever gets this in first without any concrete problems is likely to obtain the initiative. Finally, 9 Eel followed by Nfl-g3/e3 is a very natural manoeuvre, which again may be more or less copied by Black with ...$Jc7-g6. Two Knights Defence: 3...5Af6 3 ... Nf6 (D) The most subtle reply. Black creates a square at a7 for his bishop, which will have to retreat anyway after a future b4 or <14. It goes without saying that the more down-to-earth moves
5...O-O and 5...d6 are also quite playable.

By now Black was threatening 8...Qia5 to ex- change the white bishop.
8 ... O-O (D)
Move-order is an extremely loose affair in this variation but the positional ideas and prob- lems are perfectly clear. The first important question is whether White is going to allow the pin ...jig4 or if he prefers 9 h3. The same goes for Black. Should he prevent Ag5 after a move like 9 Nc4 or not? If he does not, opting, for instance, for the quiet develop- ing move 9...Jle6, the next question is how to react to 10 .S.g5. The classical but doubie-edged method is to reply 10...h6 1 1 Jlh4 °5. when af- ter 12 J*.g3 Black will want to establish firm control over the kingside with a manoeuvre like ...<2)e7-g6-f4. but in the meantime White will try to break open the centre and occupy f5 with a knight. Another positional problem that both play- ers will have to solve is whether offering an ex- change of bishops with j?,e3 or ...."Le6 makes sense, and if the answer is yes, should the re- capture on e3 or e6 be made with a piece (rook or knight) or with the f-pawn? In the latter This move is more aggressive than 3....&C5, since the knight is attacking e4. But it is also a tremendous provocation, for why on earth should White not respond with 4 Aig5. attack- ing f7? We shall be looking at this move shortly. In fact, 3...Nf6 is a pawn sacrifice and 4 <2)g5 is the way to accept it, but there are great compli- cations involved and not everyone will feel at home in this line. White can also continue in a more 'normal' way and the most 'normal' thing to do is perhaps 4 <14. a move which combines motifs from the Italian with the Scotch Opening. This variation, leading to an immediate struggle in the centre, has been heavily analysed. Although in some lines play becomes very complicated indeed, there are also a few lines where the tension is resolved rather quickly with a somewhat shal- low middlegame lying ahead. For this reason 4
ITALIAN GAME 307
idea is twofold. If 5 Bxf7+, Black calmly re- plies 5...4'e7, judging (or hoping) that, after 6 Ji.d5 2f8. for instance, his lead in development will compensate for the missing pawn. If this is already quite a show of optimism and boldness, it is nothing compared to what happens after 5 >53xf7, for in that case Black ignites an unparal- leled display of fireworks with 5...Bxf2+! (D). ;4 is not seen very often in tournaments of the .-.ighest level any more. The modem approach is 4 d3. just as it is igainst 3..Bc5. White opts for a slow posi- tional struggle, not for flashy tactical lines.
4 O-O. the move which is White's most dan-
gerous reply to 3...£tf6 in the Ruy Lopez, is less :o the point, the difference being that Black can simply play 4...4bxe4, when both 5 d4 and 5 Sei (or 5 Qe2) are countered by 5...d5, protect- ing the knight and attacking the bishop. 4 <2)c3 also shows up a negative side to 3 Xc4, for far from defending e4, this move is ac- tually an invitation to take it! After the standard combination 4...>51x64! 5 5)xe4 d5, followed, for instance, by 6 J.d.3 dxe4 7 ,xe4 Jld6. Black can be very satisfied with the result of the opening. He is able to develop his pieces freely and, with a pawn on e5, his central position is solid.
3...2rf6 4 4jg5
4 >Rlg5 (D) There are two points justifying this sacrifice:
6 Qxf2 is met by 6...£}xe4+ 7 'i'gl Rh4 8 g3
Nxg3! and 6 *fl by 6...'Qe7 7 Nxh8 d5 8 exd5 >2)d4 threatening 9...iLg4. In both cases Black's material deficit is almost too large to be mea- sured, but the force of his attack is enough to chill one's blood. Whether the Traxler will survive the test of new, computerized analysis is moot though. Black is aiming very high indeed and the slight- est hiccup in one of the many variations may turn out to be a death warrant. But as an exam- ple of what can be achieved by imagination and courage, the Traxler deserves a very honour- able mention indeed, even if it were to end up in a museum display case. 5 exd5 Now if Black has played 4...d5 with the in- tention of simply taking back on d5, he is in for a nasty surprise. As long ago as 1600 it was al- ready common knowledge that 5...Qxd5 really invites White to offer a very dangerous knight sacrifice: 6 2fitf7!? &xfT 7 Qf3+. It is true that a forced win for White has never been found against the only possible reply 7...Re6, but one and a half centuries later it was established that From this position, some of the most myste- rious opening variations in chess take their cue. 4 ... d5 This move may seem self-evident, almost forced really, but it is not. for Black has the most astonishing option of playing 4...jlc5. This is the Traxler (or Wilkes-Barre) Varia- tion, a rare bird in the tournament arena but the subject of fierce theoretical arguments among theoreticians for well over a century now. The

the preliminary move 6 d4! (D) is even stron- ger. Jlxb5+ JtLd7 also offers him a solid lead in de- velopment. Playing 5...b5 immediately is a refinement of the same idea. Paradoxically, 6 AxbS Rxd5 gives Black the initiative while the highly un- likely retreat 6 JLfl is the real fighting option, for if now 6...'Qxd5 White has the powerful re- ply 7 £k:3 (and only then 8 Axb5) and 6...Nxd5 is answered by 7 Jkxb5. when Black can no lon- ger reply ...Qd5. Black's strongest moves are considered to be 6...Nd4 (when 7 c3 transposes to the 5...<?}d4 variation) and 6...h6.

6 d3 is an alternative of long standing, the

The dividends of 4 *2Bg5 have been reaped, but now the price has to be paid. The knight has no safe retreat. If 6... xd4 7 c3 Black simply loses a piece, while 6...exd4 7 ()-() gives White a terrific at- tack along the e-file. As a sample line, 7...Ji.e7
8 Nx f7! St?xf7 9 Rh5+*c6? loses to 10fiel+.
Does this mean then that 4...d5 or even
3...Nf6 is just plain bad? Some players will say
'yes it is', but the official theoretical answer is somewhat different. In the course of the centu- ries, no fewer than three methods have been de- veloped to try to justify Black's opening play. The positional outline of these variations is al- ways the same: White's d5-pawn is liquidated in one way or another, leaving Black with full control over the centre. Black will also have a lead in development, for White's queenside is as yet fully undeveloped and both his c4-bishop and his g5-knight will be chased away. But whether these lines really offer fall com- pensation for the missing pawn is as unclear to- day as it was one or two hundred years ago. In the end, pawn sacrifices of tins type are always a matter of taste. The materialistic type will al- ways prefer White, while those with a hankering for the initiative will be inclined to favour Black. 5 ... fta5 This has always been Black's most popular' move, but 5..X/jd4 and even the amazing 5...b5 have also had their followers over the years.
5...Nd4 is based on the highly imaginative
idea 6 c3 b5! 7 ±f1 2\xd5 (D). Black need not be afraid of 8 cxd4 ' 'xg5 9 .Nxb5+ Qd8 and the quieter 8 i>4 5)e6 9
ITALIAN GAME 309
This is the main starting position of the
5...<22Ba5 variation.
9 <2tf3 is the classical move. Black will con- tinue to harass the knight with 9...e4 10 'SteS and now, for example, 10,..Jld6. 9 4hh3 leaves the knight standing rather off- side, but has the advantage of allowing White to develop his queenside more quickly and to sta- bilize his central position with d3.

ous option, for it allows Black to lake on e4 without any problems. The main lines in this position are 5..dtc5 and 5...'?3xe4, but Black is not forced to play so sharply. A solid reply like 5...d6 6 Qxd4 Be7 7 4k3 O-O is perfectly legitimate, although this is of course slightly passive. In fact, the position strongly resembles a Ruy Lopez Steinitz Varia- tion (see page 272).
3...Nf6 4 d4 exd4 5 O-O Ac5

If the latter move can be summarized as simply accepting the pawn sacrifice inherent in
3...Qf6, 4 d4 is exactly the opposite: White sac-
rifices a pawn himself. His aim is quick devel- opment and an open centre. He is hoping to obtain the initiative rather than gain material. This used to be an important variation, espe- cially during the 19th century, but nowadays any well-informed player will have little diffi- culty in neutralizing the dangers. As a result, 4 d4 has lost much of its former charm. 4 ... exd4 In case of 4,..4uxe4 5 dxe5. White can be sat- isfied.

This move may cause some momentary con- fusion when first seen. Is this really possible?

This move, which takes advantage of two different pins, justifies White's opening play. Probably because it is such fun to play a move like this, the variation has always been fairly popular at club level. But opening theory holds a chilly view on this line. After 8...Qa5 9 Nxc4 ,Ne6 10 eg5 O-O-O 1 1 5Bxc6 fxe6 12 Exc6, for instance, White has regained all of the material sacrificed, but he has given away the initiative he once had. and Black has nothing to worry about. 4 d3 4 d3 This is the twin brother of 3...Bc5 4 d3 (see page 305), to which 4....&C5 now transposes. But Black has a perfectly sound alternative. 4 ... ke7 The bishop will be less active on e7 (com- pared to the c5-square) for the time being, but on the other hand Black does not now have to worry about the consequences of d4 or b4. He can concentrate on a straightforward develop- ment of his pieces.
5 ()-() O-O (D)
This position is critical. It is quite clear what White's general idea is, but there is the difficult problem of move-order. If Black plays the mod- est ...d6. White will want to reply c3 and 9 bd2, much the same as in the d3 lines of the Ruy Lopez. But in this position. Black still has the trump card ...d5 up his sleeve. This makes the situation delicate and theoretically interesting.
6 c3 is the nice and straightforward method,
but unfortunately this move is precisely what makes 6...d5 so attractive, because in the rather open position which arises after 7 exd5 Nxd5 the weakening of White's d3-pawn is a telling factor. For example, the plausible 8 Eel may be met by 8... .g4 9 h3 Jlh5. If 10 g4 -Ng6 1 1 3)xe5 Nxe5 12 Exe5, Black has 12...Qb6!. subtly putting his finger on the weak spot. For this reason, 6 Eel is often played. This prevents ...d5, but White will now have to take care that his king's bishop does not get ex- changed after 6...d6, threatening 7...?)a5. In this position a remarkable transposition to a line of the Ruy Lopez is hidden: after 7 c3 <2)a5
8 Bb5 a6 9 Ba4 b5 10 Jlc2 c5 we have the
same position as after 3 ,Nb5 a6 4 .i;,a4 <?Bf6 5 O-O jLe7 6 Eel b5 7 Bb3 d6 8 c3 O-O and now 9 d3 (instead of 9 h3 - see page 288) 9...'?Ba5 10 Bc2 c5. 1 have not mentioned this as a separate variation in the chapter on the Ruy Lopez, but it is in fact fairly often played by people wishing to avoid the heavily-analysed 9 h3 lines. This clearly shows how delicate a task evalu- ating the position after 5...O-O has become. In fact White has a third option, which is to play 6 Jlb3. With his pawn still on c2. White is happy to allow 6...d5 and if 6...d6 he will play 7 c3, tak- ing the game into well-known territory. With the bishop already on b3. White will meet 7...Na5 with 8 Nc2, without having to waste time on Jlc4-b5-a4-c2. It is interesting though that the tmly bold meet 7 c3 with 7...d5 regardless of having played 6...d6 one move before. Obvi- ously, they feel that the weakening of d3 com- pensates for the loss of tempo involved in ...d6-d5, a decidedly unorthodox point of view. Scotch Opening

3 d4 (D)
3 ... exd4 4 5)xd4 The history of the Scotch is an interesting one. Il became popular after a correspondence match between chess clubs from Edinburgh and London, which lasted from 1824 to 1828 and gave the opening its name. But this popu- larity was based on 4 Jlc4 (nowadays referred to as the Scotch Gambit), an approach which is considered fairly harmless if Black calmly re- plies 4...?)f6, transposing to the 4 d4 line of the Two Knights Defence that we discussed in the previous chapter (see page 309). Simply recap- turing on d4 was thought to be harmless and it has even had the reputation of being a 'drawing weapon' for a very long time. It was thought to show a lack of interest in maintaining the re- quired tension in the position. But in 1990 the Scotch received a tremendous boost when Garry Kasparov used it to good effect in a match for the world championship against Anatoly Kar- pov. Almost overnight, the Scotch was trans- formed from a dusty museum piece into a dynamic modem opening. It is now seen as White's most important alternative to the Ruy Lopez. White has a third option in 4 c3, the Goring Gambit. This opening has always lived on the outskirts of opening theory, in the twilight zone where distrust and scepticism meet with fanati- cism and where things are hardly ever seen in a clear light. It is a real gambit where White dares his opponent to capture one or even two pawns while he develops his pieces quickly and ag- gressively. By playing 4,..dxc3 5 €)xc3 (5 Ac4 is an option) followed, for instance, by 5..Jtb4 6 -sLc4 d6 Black accepts the challenge, but ea- ger devotees of the Goring also have to take the unsentimental 4,..d5 into account. After 5 exd5 ' 'xd5 6 cxd4 White suddenly faces a situation which differs greatly from what he was (per- haps) expecting. In a rather rigid position, the In the previous two chapters, we have seen several methods for White to seek an advantage in the centre, most of them based on long-term planning and very often involving c3 in prepara- tion of d4. By playing 3 d4 straightaway. White chooses a different approach: clear, uncompli- cated and above all direct. White creates a half- open centre where he can count on a spatial ad- vantage and easy development for all his pieces. It may also be counted as an advantage that White determines the character of the opening (and probably the middlegame too) himself, un- like the Ruy Lopez where he has to be prepared for a great number of widely different variations. The downside of this carefree approach is that it also clears the view for the opponent. Black enjoys similarly easy development and he is still free to adapt his plans exactly to the type of position that White has now created. This is a marked advantage over some lines of the Ruy Lopez where Black has already walled in his dark-squared bishop with ...d6 before White plays d4. for instance in the Steinitz Variation (3 Ab5 d6 4 d4).

All of a sudden it is White who has to be careful. 6 c3 It is a pity for White to have to play this move, for he would of course have liked to re- serve this square for his queen's knight, but the only alternative is to play the ultra-sharp 6 4Bb5 Jtxe3 7 fxe3 and there are few players who trust this. White needs to be prepared for the compli- cations of 7...Rh4+ 8 g3 Rxe4 and he has to value his attacking chances after 7...Rd8 or
8... d8 enough not to worry about his ruined
pawn-structure. 6 ... ge7 (D) There are two main lines in this position, both aimed at obtaining active counterplay against White's central position: 4....c5 and 4,..Q)f6. Of the alternatives, 4...'fh4 is the most note- worthy, mainly because it may come as a great shock to one who is unprepared. This looks very aggressive, but in fact what is required to play such a move with any degree of success is mainly good defensive skills. White is practi- cally forced to sacrifice his e-pawn (which im- plies that the Scotch is really a gambit!), yet by doing so he obtains a truly dangerous initiative. An important starting point for this variation arises after 5 Nc3 J-b4 6 Jte2 Rxe4 7 Nb5. If, for example, 7... .xc3+ 8 bxc3 'S'dS 9 O-O Black has won a pawn, but with his king in the middle of the board he faces a difficult defensive task.

But in 1991 the 4...jLc5 variation was trans- formed by the sudden reappearance of 7 Bc4 <D) on the scene. assessments of certain characteristic positions changed dramatically. 5 ... Rf6 This surprising move had been the reason why 5 ,5fxc6 was never taken very seriously. It is not that Black is intending to recapture on c6 with the queen (for c6 would not be a good square), but by threatening mate on f2 Black forces his opponent to make an 'awkward' move. There is no comfortable way of protect- ing f2. He must either advance wildly with 6 f4 or put his queen on an 'awkward' square. It needed a player of the calibre of World Cham- pion Garry Kasparov to assure the chess world that this is not a problem for White:
6 d2 (D)
This was a move that had been dismissed as early as the 19th century, with opening manuals reducing it to a mere footnote saying "7...Ne5 8 ale2 Rg6 9 O-O d5 is very' good for Black", or even omitted it altogether. But now it turned out that 10 Jlh5! is a very strong continuation of the above variation, for after 10...Rxe4 11 Nd2 Black is in great trouble. No other ways of ca- sually refuting 7 Ji.c4 were found, and a true hype was launched, which put not just 7 Ac4, but also the Scotch Opening as a whole, on the agenda of almost every top player. Theory of this line has been completely rewritten and now contains many a sharp variation, full of pawn sacrifices and other materially unbalanced po- sitions.

Around 1994, the world had more or less re- covered from the 7 Jtc4 shock when a new problem arose. After 5 Be3 had been trans- formed from a rather slack move into a danger ous attacking weapon, it turned out that 5 Qxc6 was also not the innocent move it had been thought for years. But in this case the problems are of a purely positional nature. Within a few years, theoretical White's idea is very simple. He wants to demonstrate that after 6...dxc6 (which was al- ways regarded as the best way to recapture) Black will experience long-term problems, es- pecially in the endgame. While plays 7 ?Bc3, in- tending to meet the natural developing move

queens. This approach turned out to contain a good deal more venom than had been thought. Black has plenty of open files for his pieces but it is not so easy to create active play and White's pawn-majority on the kingside is pa- tiently waiting to move forward. Little by little, alternative responses for Black were investi- gated. starting with the question of how to re- capture on c6. Interest in 6...Rxc6 has never been great.

7 White continues to harass the black bishop. He intends 8 '<Bd5. when 9 4hxb6 is a very real positional threat, now that Black can no longer take back on b6 with the a-pawn. White now faces a very concrete problem. How is he to protect e4 without hampering the natural flow of his active piece development? The simplest answer is to play 5 Qic3. but this rather invites Black to continue the attack against e4 by playing 5...Bb4 and cannot be seen as a permanent solution. Still, this is a clas- sical variation, called the Scotch Four Knights Game. 5 ?Bxc6 is a much more radical approach. White questions the soundness of Black's pre- vious move, for he intends to meet 5...bxc6 with 6 e5, taking over the initiative. This is the Mieses Variation. It is one of the oldest yet one of the most hotly debated variations of the Scotch today. Some highly unorthodox and very complicated positions are likely to arise. Scotch Four Knights Game

7...d6 is the more solid move. Black simply

Black has achieved a great deal. He can de- velop his pieces freely and instead of facing a dominant white pawn on e4, he has a central pawn-majority himself. But White still has one trump card up his sleeve and this is a rather for- midable one:
10 5 (D)
By thus pinning Black's king's knight, White makes it clear that there is also a downside to Black's aggressive opening play. 1 1 Jlxf6 is threatened, so Black has to protect d5. This is the most important starting position of the Scotch Four Knights Game. 10...Jte6 and 10...c6 are the main lines. In both cases Black has to be prepared for 11 Rf3. confronting Black (again) with the possi- bility of .xf6 and initiating a potentially dan- gerous concentration of attacking forces against Black's king. The variation 10...c6 11 Qf3 Jte7
12 Sael h6 1 3 .xh6!? gxh6 14 Re3 is illustra-
tive of the situation's volatility. This position has been studied for well over a century and the con- clusion is that 14...d4! 15 Qxh6 Rd6! forces White to take a draw by perpetual check, an assessment which has saddled the Scotch Four Knights Game with the stigma of being a drawish opening. This is doing this ancient opening a terrible injustice! There is plenty of scope for both sides to deviate from the above variation. Black also has to take the manoeuvre Ne2 into account. Especially if Black plays 10...jie6, this looks rather inviting, with 1 1 Qe2 jtc7 1 2 <?)d4 as a plausible continuation, but also after
10...c6 there is no reason why White has to
avoid 1 1 F\e2. A modern variation on this theme is to play 5)a4, for instance after 10...c6, when 11 l$3a4 signals White's intention to concentrate his forces on the queenside rather than against Black's king. He may start a frontal attack against Black's centre with c4, but c3 followed by b4 is also an option. Mieses Variation 5 3xc6 hxc6 6 e5 The quiet continuation 6 Bd3 offers White no better chances after 6...d5 than the Scotch Four Knights Game does.

7 Re2 £jd5
8 c4 (D)
This is the critical position of the Mieses Variation and quite possibly of the entire Scotch Opening. White wants to chase the knight away from d5 and develop his pieces as aggressively as possible. Black has set his sights on attack- ing e5. The character of the middlegame will be determined by the method he chooses for doing so.
8...,i,a6 is the sharpest option. For a long
time this move was even thought to be self- evident. Black's motto here is 'Never move backwards until forced to do so!'. This attitude leads to great complications. A few of the prob- lems that have to be solved: a) After 9 b3 O-O-O 10 g3 2e8 1 1 Ab2 f6 12 Bg2 fxe5, is Black happy with the extra pawn or will he suffer from the chaotic state of his piece development? b) Which side stands to gain from the wild variation 9 b3 Rh4 10 a3 Bc5 1 1 g3 Bxf2+? In many cases an advance of the a-pawn will come in handy, for instance after 9 4Bd2: 9...a5
10 g3 Qc6 1 1 b3 a4. And ...Ba6 remains an op-
tion. If 9 Qc3, for example, 9...Re6 10 Rc4 Ba6. with the idea of answering 11 b3 with H...±b4 121.d2±xc3 13 ±xc3d5, is critical. The Mieses Variation demands great versa- tility from both players: accurate calculations, a feeling for dynamic positions with unbalanced material, but also subtle positional judgement. What should one think, for instance, of the end- game that arises if in the last-mentioned varia- tion Black plays 10...d5 1 1 exd6 cxd6 (instead of 10...Aa6j? Four Knights Game

Black's bishop is undoubtedly well-placed on g7, but White's freedom of movement is con- siderably greater than if the bishop were on b4. We now return to 3...'2)f6 (D):

3 Nc3 (D)
Compared to 3 Nb5. 3 Jlc4 and 3 d4, this is a neutral, almost a waiting move. Black is not immediately put under pressure, so one would expect there to be a large choice of possible re- plies now. Strangely enough, this turns out not to be the case and it is precisely this aspect, the fact that Black does not have a wide range of re- plies, which makes this an attractive opening for White. To begin with, there is just one re- sponse to 3 Jc3 which theory unreservedly ap- proves of. 3 ... 4hf6 With this move, we have reached the Four Knights Game, so named for obvious reasons. There are alternatives, naturally, but none of them comes without certain problems. The following lines are known collectively by the equally logical name of the Three Knights Game. The seemingly natural 3...Bc5, for instance, runs into 4 <2)xe5!, a standard combination which we have already seen in the Two Knights Defence (with colours reversed: 3 ,"i.c4 '<!f6 4 'Ac3 ?3xe4). Both 4...Nxe5 5 d4 and 4,..Jlxf2+ Like all 1 e4 e5 openings, the Four Knights Game is a very old opening, dating back at least to the 16th century. But it was only when modem, positional chess took over from the old romantic school that its merits were fully appreciated. In the early 20th century, the Four
FOUR KNIGHTS GAME 319
Knights Game was very popular indeed. This .-.eyday was followed by a long period of ne- glect, when it began to be associated in peo- ple's minds with ideas of safety, avoiding risks and avoiding a fight altogether. Playing 3 4*3c3 even began to be seen as a tacit draw offer. But around 1990, this sad period of slow de- .ay came to an abrupt halt. Many variations

thusiasm. and it was again played at the highest level of tournament chess. The Four Knights Game is now completely accepted once more as an opening which is indeed safe, but not at all devoid of tension or attacking power. White has plenty of means to try to make things difficult for his opponent, if he so desires.
4 Bb5
The classical move in this position. White adopts the idea of the Ruy Lopez, hoping that the addition of <Nc3 and ...QJf6 will be in his fa- vour.
4 d4 is an equally natural move. This leads to
the Scotch Four Knights Game after 4...exd4 5 >3xd4 (see page 315), but White has a surpris- ing and very aggressive (and risky!) alternative in 5 41)d5 (D), avoiding the disagreeable pin 5 <3xd4 Bb4 in rather a drastic fashion. this. But it is important to know that Black is not forced to enter these complications. The simple developing move 5...jLe7 is a perfectly sound alternative.
4 g3 is a relatively new variation. It was in-
spired by the recent success of a similar line in the Vienna Opening (see page 342) and is a per- fect example of the modem interpretation of the Four Knights Game. If Black replies by doing what White has just refused to do, viz. taking the initiative in the centre by 4...d5 5 exd5 <2)xd5, the situation is very similar to the 3...g6 line, but the extra tempo (Nf3) makes White's position much more promising than Black's in the analogous situation. For this reason, many players prefer quieter moves like 4...i.b4 or
4...jLc5, keeping the centre closed. Either way,
the 4 g3 variation usually leads to some fierce fighting in the middlegame and is a far cry from what was once thought to be a drawish opening. If White is thinking of developing his bishop to c4, he should prefer to do so a move earlier, for 4 Bc4 runs into 4...Nxe4!, a trap we have already noted in the chapter on the Italian Game (see page 307). We now return to 4 3Lb5 (D): One major difference from the Ruy Lopez is that Black cannot get away so easily with
4...a6, for 5 Bxc6 dxc6 6 Nxe5 is then a
highly realistic option. It is true that Black re- gains the pawn by playing 6...Q)xe4 7 <2>xe4 Qd4, but after the simple 8 O-O Qxe5 9 Hel or
9 d4 White has a very comfortable lead in de-
velopment. This is the Belgrade (Jambit. White is hop- ing to tempt Black into the complications of

4...d6 too. though playable, is hardly a test of
the soundness of the Four Knights Game: after
5 d4 we find ourselves in the Ruy Lopez Stein-
itz Variation (see page 272). This means that Black has to play more ag- gressively. Two main lines have been devel- oped over the years, both with a character of their own: the symmetrical 4...Ab4 and the sharp 4../2)d4.
4...Ab4
4 ... Ab4 After this move there is not much sense in taking on c6 and e5, for Black can do the same on c3 and c4. Nor is 5 <2)d5 to be feared because of o.-. xdS 6 exd5 e4.', which is in fact a stan- dard tactic to note. It plays a major part in the
4...'2Bd4 line.

This is the crucial position of the 4..Bb4 variation. No matter how innocent the previous moves may seem, this is a truly interesting and tense situation. ...exd4 any more, since that would only provide White with a very powerful central formation after cxd4. This again means that Black will probably have to remain passive in the centre. On the other hand, having doubled c-pawns means that White will not be able to create any inroads on the queenside by means of pawn- breaks. The standard plan of playing d4-d5 fol- lowed by c4, b4 and c5 is no longer feasible. The result is that play is likely to become slow and based on long-term planning and will require patience and good positional skills from both players. Both sides will be searching for a weak spot in the opponent's armour. A classical continuation is 8...Qe7 9 Eel R3d8 10 d4 43e6 (a standard unpinning manoeuvre) 1 1 Jtc 1 (the bishop has fulfilled its job at g5 and now re- treats; 1 1 Bh4 would allow 1 1 ...Nf4) and now, for instance, 11...C5. This is in fact a cunning way to protect c5: if 12 dxe5 dxe5 13 #Ixc5?? Nc7! White loses a piece. 4,..Nd4 4 ... 21d4 (D) This aggressive move was responsible for the gradual disappearance of the Four Knights Game around 1920. Players on the white side became discouraged, doubts were raised as to the correctness of 4 Bb5 and after a while ev- erybody went back to playing the 'regular' Ruy Lopez again: 3 Bb5. It took seventy years for this deadlock to be broken. When al the end of the 20th century a fresh interest in other moves White is threatening 8 4dd5. If Black has no wish to try something risky like 7... .g4 or
7...>2te7. he should eliminate White's queen's
knight by 7...Bxc3. This exchange changes the character of the position considerably. After 8 bxc3 White has increased his control over the centre squares, which means that he can play d4 at his leisure, without having to worry about
FOUR KNIGHTS GAME 321
than 3 Nb5 took hold of the chess world, this variation too was re-examined and found to be far more interesting than had been thought. Black sacrifices a pawn for the initiative. That is most certainly a reasonable proposition, but exactly how reasonable? Is the initiative worth more than a pawn? Is it almost worth a pawn? Is it just enough? It is these delicate as- sessments which become ever more subtle and ever more accurate when a variation gets ana- lysed ever more deeply. In fact, this discussion has not come to an end yet (and is perhaps un- likely ever to do so), but what has become per- fectly clear is that here a small part of opening theory which was thought to be dead has fully come back to life again. In the position after 4...<?3d4, several moves have been tried. To begin with, 5 $)xe5 needs to be exam- ined. It is obvious that Black regains the pawn if he just plays 5...Re7 6 f4 Nxb5 7 Qxb5 d6, but it is less clear how the position after 8 Qf3 Rxe4+ 9 S&f2 should be evaluated. Is Black's queen in trouble or not?
5 Nxd4 exd4 6 e5 is a very different idea.
White offers a pawn himself, hoping to obtain a strong initiative after 6...dxc3 7 exf6, 7...cxd2+
8 Jl.xd2 Qxf6 9 O-O allows White a tremen-
dous lead in development. Unfortunately Black neutralizes this idea pretty easily by playing
7...Rxf6 8 dxc3 Qe5+, forcing his opponent ei-
ther to offer an exchange of queens (9 Qe2) or to retreat the bishop (9 Ne2). But the really critical test of 4...4bd4 is thought to be a calm retreat of the bishop, thus keeping up the pressure on Black's position. There are two ways of accomplishing this. One is 5 jlc4, but by far the most popular move is the Ruy Lopez-oriented... 5 .R.a4 (D) White allows his opponent to solve the prob- lem of how to protect e5 very simply with
5...5)xf3+. relying on the small yet tangible
lead in development that he enjoys after 6 Qxf3. Most 4...Nd4 players are unlikely to go in for this rather tame line, for the whole point of this variation is that the dominant position of his knight provides Black with the chance of ob- taining the initiative, even at the cost of a pawn. 5 ... Jkc5 This is the move that gave White a real head- ache in the early decades of the 20th century. Black continues to develop his pieces aggres- sively without minding the loss of his e-pawn. It is also the move at which rehabilitation work of some seventy years later first took aim. Now- adays players are not so sure any more whether Black's compensation is fully adequate. This uncertainty has caused a search for al- ternatives and has led to the rediscovery of
5...c6. The idea is to meet 6 Nxe5 with 6...d6 7
5)f3 Ag4, when the pin against his king's knight is very annoying for White. Analysis of this new line is still in full swing. 6 $3xe5 O-O Black's play may seem almost too casual: he simply continues to develop his pieces without worrying about material or the fact that White now forces back some of his most actively posted pieces with 7 Nd3 jLb6 8 e5 Ne8. But the crux of the matter is that White's queenside is difficult to develop and this problem is only aggravated by these moves, for it is now not just Black's d4-knight, but also his own d3-knight which is blocking White's d-pawn and thereby causing all the congestion. Black will open the centre with ...d6 and if White is not careful this may cause real trouble for him. But of course it is in the accuracy of solving these problems that theory has made progress. Nowadays, among many options, 9 |9Ad5, freeing the way for c3, has become the main line. It is the starting move for some very thoroughly analysed varia- tions. Petroff Defence
1 e4 e5
2 Nf3 43f6 (D)
By playing this move, Black approaches the position in a way which can be described as the diametric opposite of 2...<£k6. Instead of de- fending his e-pawn, Black copies his opponent and attacks e4. This may seem more aggres- sive, but the idea is in fact to keep the position (relatively) simple and straightforward. least occasionally. In fact, this opening is prob- ably much more popular among the world's best players than at club level - a paradoxical situation if one considers that the Petroff usu- ally produces fairly simple positions strategi- cally. Would it not seem that 'simple' positions are for 'simple' players? Apparently not. In- deed, rather the opposite may be true. It is pre- cisely the so-called simple positions which are the most difficult ones, as a single error can condemn a player to grim defence. Handling these positions accurately takes a very strong player indeed, with exceedingly subtle posi- tional feeling and good all-round intuition. The Petroff Defence owes its name to Alex- ander Petroff (1794-1867) who analysed this opening together with Carl Jaenisch (1813-72) in the first half of the 19th century. It is also known as the Russian Defence. There are two main lines, 3 <5'Bxe5 and 3 d4. If White prefers not to part with his e-pawn, he should play 3 <2te3, transposing to the Four Knights Game if Black replies 3...Nc6. There is, however, the alternative 3...J.b4 (which might be said to be more in the spirit of 2...€)f6), when after 4 <?3xe5 O-O it is probably unwise to protect the e-pawn with 5 d3, for this allows Black to play 5...d5! with a strong initiative. The main line here is 5 Jle2 Ne8 6 <5)d3 ,Bxc3 7 dxc3 <2}xe4 8 O-O. Instead, 3 d3 is simply not aggres- sive enough to worry Black. This is the sort of move which signals a willingness to leave open- ing theory behind, rather than make a contribu- tion to it.

In case both e-pawns disappear, the remain- ing pawn-formation will be symmetrical. Any- one hoping to achieve an opening advantage from such a position should basically focus on two stratagems. In the first place, both players will be trying to develop their pieces as quickly and as aggressively as possible, a strategy which often involves pawn sacrifices. Secondly, one needs good technique and a lot of patience to make the most of every positional advantage that happens to come one's way. no matter how insignificant it may seem. The Petroff was a popular opening in the 19th century; but then fell into disgrace (getting stigmatized as a drawish opening, quite un- justly so) until it was resurrected around 1980. Among the present top grandmasters, there is almost no one who does not play the Petroff at

4...'?Bxe4. So simple!
4 Nf3
The only real attempt to throw a spanner in Black's plan is to sacrifice a knight in the ro- mantic style that belongs to the 19th century: 4 Nxf7. Bluffers, charlatans and grandmasters have tried this kill-or-cure remedy, yet - al- though it has been known since the times of Jaenisch and Petroff - until recently no decent opening manual would do much more than mention its existence, probably because no one knew what to think of it. This is a true sacrifice. White is looking to obtain a long-term initiative, based on his men- acing pawn-centre and the insecure position of Black's king after 4...Nxf7 5 d4. If 5...Nxe4? White regains the piece with 6 Rh5+ ite.1 (or Having first inserted 3...d6, Black can now safely take on e4 without having to worry about

than an exchange of queens can happen to him. But if we look at the position from White's perspective, it becomes clear that he has to at- tack the e4-knight in some way. How? The simplest method is to play 5 d3, but this does not really pose any problems to Black. He just replies 5...<21f6 and has nothing to worry about. The developing move 5 4jc3 is equally straightforward but contains a lot more venom. After 5...Nxc3 White plays 6 dxc3 and has at least opened another central file for his rooks, albeit at the cost of doubled pawns, which takes away some of the flexibility in his position. This is quite a popular alternative today, but the main line is still unchallenged: 5 d4 With this classical move. White refuses to make any compromise on optimal piece devel- opment. He will play 6 jtd3 and leave it to his

because White has just played c3. Neverthe- less, many attempts have been made to refute Black's set-up, mostly starting with 10 Rb3. but up until now Black has managed to come up with an answer to everything. For this reason, many players prefer to tackle the problem of 8... .g4 in a totally different way: instead of 9 c3 they play 9 c4 or even 8 c4. This very often leads to a position where White has an isolated queen's pawn and which - gen- erally speaking - demands good positional un- derstanding and a sharp eye for finesse and small advantages rather than a flair for tactical problems. One of the main lines goes 8 c4 Nb4
9 Jte2 O-O and now either 10 Nc3 Be6 or 10 a3
Nc6. Alternatively, the more straightforward 9 cxd5 (instead of 9 Ne2) 9...'21xd3 10 Qxd3 Rxd5 1 1 Sei Bf5 12 Nc3 Nxc3 13 Qxc3 is also a line to be reckoned with. White loses no time moving his bishop from d3 and tries to make optimal use of the pin on the e-file. The second option is to play 6...Bd6 (D). This is one of the critical positions of the Pctroff Defence. Il is the starting point for sev- eral variations that have been studied thor- oughly and over a very long period of time, but remain interesting and double-edged to this day. The first sign that a fierce battle may be about to break out is the discovery that after
6...Jle7 7 O-O it is not the insipid 7...O-O. but the
more aggressive 7...o)c6 (or 6...'2)c6 7 O-O Jle7) which constitutes the main line. This is an ex- cellent way of anticipating the natural 8 Sei. for Black now has the aggressive reply 8...Bg4. when 9 Jlxe4 dxe4 10 Zxe4 JLxf.3 1 1 Rxf3 (or 1 1 gxf3 f5) ll...'2)xd4 offers White no advan- tage whatsoever. If White protects his d-pawn with 9 c3, Black lakes advantage of this lull in the fighting to play 9...f5. This aggressive ad- vance is often unreliable because of a swift c4. opening the centre, or because of Ne5. but both these moves are now less attractive because of the active positioning of Black's pieces and At first sight it may look as if the c4 plan is (even) stronger now than in the 6...Jle7 varia- tion. but the point of 6... .d6 is that Black now intends to meet this move with ...c6. The criti- cal position arises after 7 O-O O-O 8 c4 c6 and again play may easily become very sharp and complicated. What should one make of the rather wild continuation 9 Sei Jff5 10 Qb3 <2)a6, when 1 1 'Sfxb7? is met by 1 l...Nb4 and 1 1 c5? by ll...&axc5' 12 dxc5 Nxc5, for in- stance? The perfectly sensible move 9 Rc2 provokes an equally violent reaction, 9...Na6,
PETROFF DEFENCE 325
when Black is counting on 10 Jlxe4 dxe4 1 1 Rxe4 Nb4 (or ll...Ee8) to offer him suffi- cient compensation for lhe sacrificed pawn. If White does not trust himself with these dangerous lines, he may want to choose the more rigid approach of 9 -5jc3 or 9 cxdS cxd5 10 £jc3. Instead of trying to undermine Black's e4-knight, White simply exchanges it off. With- out this central stronghold. Black becomes vul- nerable to an attack on the kingside. After 9 cxd5 cxd5 10 Nc3 lNxc3 1 1 bxc3, for instance. 1 1 ... c6 12 Yg5 is already quite dangerous for Black. Pinning the knight with 1 1 ...Jlg4 is more circumspect, but this too may lead to great complications after 12 Ebl. as at least equally important, but this is now preferred only by those who want to avoid the complications of the thoroughly-analysed main lines. After 4 e5 Ne4 5 'S'xd4 d5 6 exd6 Nxd6 and now, for example. 7 41c3 41c6 8 W14 Black must be very' careful not to allow White's tiny lead in development to grow into a dangerous initiative. 3 d4
4 Nd3 (D)
4 dxeS is possible of course, but the idea of 3 d4 is primarily to arrive at the same type of po- sition as 3 41xc5 via 4 jld3 d5 5 £jxe5. The only difference is that after 3 41xe5 d6 4 41f3 41xe4 5 d4 d5 6 .S.d3 White's king's knight is on 1'3, whereas in the 3 d4 variation it is on e5. Once one has come to the conclusion that there is no such thing as a simple refutation of the Petroff after 3 <23xe5, it becomes natural to start looking for alternatives. With 3 d4. White basically approaches the position in the same way as with the Scotch. But whereas 3 d4 against 2...i?3c6 is hugely different from, say, 3 Jtb5 (meaning that 3 d4 can easily unsettle an opponent who was expecting 3 Bb5), 3 d4 against 2...Nf6 is only marginally different from
3 Qxe5 and is not likely to cause Black much
psychological distress. 3 ... Qlxe4(D) This is by far lhe most popular move nowa- days. Until about 1970, 3...exd4 was regarded 4 ... d5 No wonder then that the chess world was so taken aback when in 1993 lhe brilliant Rus- sian Yakov Murei came up with the fantastic
326 FUNDAMENTAL CHESS OPENINGS
alternative 4...£te6, which potentially uproots the whole 3 d4 variation. If 5 jlxe4, Black re- gains the piece with 5...d5 6 Jkd3 e4 and even the ingenious 5 d5 fails to refute 4... c6, for Black has 5...Nc5 (or 5...Nf6) 6 dxc6 e4, again winning back the sacrificed piece. Nevertheless, after an initial wave of popu- larity, Murei's move has failed to replace 4...d5 as the main line. A refutation has never been found, but once the consequences of 4,..Nc6 were thoroughly analysed, it became clear that White is not denied his rightful chances of ob- taining a 'normal' opening advantage. He may try, for instance, to prove that his slightly better pawn configuration after 5 d5 6 dxc6 e4 7 cxb7 ±xb7 8 jLe2 cxf3 9 A.xf'3 is worth some- thing, or he may try 5 dxe5 d5 6 exd6 4bxd6 7 O-O, when his pieces are slightly more actively placed. Winning a pawn with 5 Jixe4 d5 6 jLxh7 seems less advisable. After 6...2xh7 7 dxe5 Jkg4 Black has a nice, easy and harmoni- ous development of his pieces to look forward to.
5 QhxeS (D)
In case of 5...Jld6, White's most ambitious plan is to play 6 O-O O-O 7 c4. aiming to under- mine the e4-knight. There are several possible replies, of which 7...jLxe5 8 dxe5 'Steb is be- lieved to be the most critical. Black is daring White to play 9 cxd5 Rxd5 10 Qc2. which leads, after 10...Qb4 11 Jlxe4 Nxc2 12 Jlxd5 ID), to a mysterious endgame. Black stands to gain an exchange on al, but the big question is whether he will be able to extricate his knight, or, to put it perhaps more accurately: at what price will he be able to do so? To give just a first impression of the compli- cations: it is not the obvious 1 2...Nxal which is the main line (for this would allow White to cut off the knight's retreat with 13 jLe4). but
12...Af5. White then sacrifices a pawn with 13
g4 in order to achieve his objective anyway, but after 13,..Axg4 (if 13...J,g6 14 f4 the black bishop gets into trouble) 14 Jle4 ftxal 15 ,f4 Black will try to drive the bishop away from e4 again: 15...f5. And we have not even started yet! This variation has been analysed in enor- mous depth. The serious analytical work only begins in the position after 16 Ji.d5+ 'i'hS 17 Sc 1 (keeping the knight locked up in the cor- ner). This overload of theoretical baggage has caused 5...Bd6 to become a somewhat esoteric variation, not readily accessible to the uniniti- ated. In practice, therefore, attention centres on
5...Nd7 ID) nowadays.
This is a fairly provocative move, for both the sacrifice 6 Nxf7 and the materialistic 6 Qe2 White has achieved his aim. This position is almost identical to the main starting position of the 3 xeS variation, the only difference being that White's knight is on e5 instead of f3. But does this really improve White's chances? The answer to this question has been swinging gently from yes to no for more than a century and a half. The two main lines start with 5...jcd6 and
5...Qd7.
PETROFF DEFENCE 327
debated main line. Black intends to play 9...jtd6, which in case of 9 cxd5 Nd6 10 g3 (10 113? .xh3! is a catastrophe for White) 10...Nxg3 1 1 hxg3 Jlxg3 12 fxg3 Rxg3+ leads to a draw by perpetual check. For this reason 9 c5 is the main line and the starting point for a rich complex of variations. Nowadays the natural 7...Ad6 is the more popular move. This implies a pawn sacrifice, for after 8 c4 c6 9 cxd5 cxd5 10 Rh5 Black has nothing better than to play 10...O-O. After 11 Rxd5 jic6 Black's harmonious piece develop- ment promises to be sufficient compensation for the pawn. Another tactical justification for
7...jLd6 lies in the fact that 8 Eel (or 9 Bel or
10 Bel) allows an immediate draw by perpet-
ual: 8... .xh2+! 9 *xh2 Qh4+ 10 *g I Rxf2+. now seem very dangerous. But it turns out that Black's position cannot be overrun so easily. After 6 4)xf7, if Black plays simply 6...'4'xf7 7 Qh5+ Qe7 White has nothing better than a draw by repetition with 8 Re2 (threatening 9 f3) 8...Nf7 9 Qh5+, etc. Besides, Black has"the ambitious 6...Qe7. And the second problem. 6 Qe2, is solved with the laconic 6...<21xe5 7 Nxe4 dxe4 8 Rxe4 i,e6 9 Rxc5 Rd7. Black's lead in development and the pair of bishops turn out to be ample compensation for the lost pawn. Therefore the usual reply to 5...£kT7 is the no-nonsense 6 Qxd7 .xd7 7 O-O (D). Surprisingly though, even here dangerous complications are lurking beneath the surface. For many years 7...Rh4 8 c4 O-O-O was a hotly King's Gambit

back to prehistoric times to follow up the open- ing moves 1 e4 e5 2 f4 exf4 3 d4 Qh4+ 4 g3 fxg3 with the remarkable 5 Qel-g2, a very strong move indeed, but alas, no longer feasible under the present laws of chess. The King's Gambit had its heyday in the early 19th century when, together with the Italian Game, it was the most popular of all openings. It was tailor-made for this, the golden age of romantic chess, when tactically-oriented play prevailed. With the rise of modern, positional chess, the King's Gambit inevitably receded into the back- ground, but there it has always kept a special place. Although the motives of the old masters were no longer understood, the force behind their favourite opening remained and was made palpable on rare occasions by courageous soli- tary chess-players who combined 19th century tactical genius with 20th century positional in- sight. As deep into the 20th century as 1938 (when the world of chess had long become rational- ized) the famous series of opening books by world champion Max Euwe could still open its chapter on the King's Gambit with the lyrical introduction "In the midst of the Open Games [meaning rhe I e4 e5 openings - PvdS] there rises, proudly and un weathered by the passage of time, the mighty fortress of the King's Gam- bit". In a way. these words are still valid today. Somehow or other, the King's Gambit seems to elude rational judgement. Countless refutations of 2 f4 have been claimed, but each and every time the opening has survived the onslaught. It remains a source of inspiration to those who have courage and imagination. And even those who do not dare to play it, can learn a great deal from the wealth of variations this opening has to offer. There is only one theme here, yet it is an eternal one, the theme that no chess-player
B
The King's Gambit is without a doubt the most fascinating of all openings. Surrounded by an aura of mystery, courage and heroism, it is this classical opening which (within the lim- its of the game of chess) comes closest to the eternal myth of the hero who leaves all earthly possessions behind and sets off in search of the Holy Grail. For it is not just technical compe- tence that is required to play this opening (i.e. tactical genius), but first and foremost an abso- lute refusal to compromise and an attitude of total commitment. After all, White does not just sacrifice a pawn. He is opening the el-h4 and gl-a7 diagonals, which means that he is ac- tually sacrificing part of the natural protection of his king. His aim in doing so is to conquer the centre, to mobilize his forces quickly and to obtain the initiative, whatever the cost. Bom in an era beyond remembrance, when not just perception and positional understand- ing were completely unlike ours today but even the laws of the game were different, the King's Gambit has been a witness to the evolution of the game of chess from its humblest begin- nings. It started with a recommendation dating
KING'S GAMBIT 329
can avoid: the battle between the initiative and a material advantage. The most prominent of these variations start with 2...exf4, the King's Gambit Accepted, but several other moves have also grown into full-blown variations, most notably 2...d5, the Falkbeer Counter-Gambit, and 2,..Xc5, the principal form of the King's Gambit De- clined. It is also useful to be acquainted with three lesser-known, yet venomous reactions to 2 f4. which I shall just briefly mention here:
2...4.c6 3 5)f3 f51? is a bold attempt to turn
the tables on White.
2...Qf6 is equally ambitious and highly pro-
vocative. If possible, Black wants to capture on f4 not with the e-pawn but with the queen, thus accepting White's pawn sacrifice, yet without yielding his own central stronghold at e5.
2...Rh4+ 3 g3 Re7 is perhaps the most orig-
inal of Black's options. Black draws the oppo- nent's g-pawn forward with the paradoxical intention of taking on f4 only when that pawn is protected! If 4 fxe5, the idea is to play 4...d6! 5 exd6 Rxe4+. It is more in the spirit of the King's Gambit to sacrifice a pawn with 4 Nf3 exf4 5 Nc3 or 4 <2k3 cxf4 5 d4. The reader may have noticed that 3 fxe5 is not an option in any of these variations, since this would allow the devastating reply 3...Qh4+. This explains why there is no need for Black to protect his e-pawn with the passive 2...d6. Then after 3 Nf3, lines like 3... 3c6 4 .b5 or 3...'?)d7
4 d4 allow White to obtain a good position Tor
free'. The only testing move is 3...exf4, with a Fischer Defence (see page 330). King's Gambit Accepted 2 ... exf4 3 -Nf3 It seems self-evident to play this move. Is not f3 the ideal square for the king's knight and is not 3...Rh4+ very efficiently prevented this way? But the 'mighty fortress of the King's Gam- bit' was not built on trivial reasoning like this. Imagination, courage and a never-ending search for the limits of what is humanly possible were equally important building materials, to say the least. The position after 2...exf4 is a perfect exam- ple. No matter how strong and logical a move 3 Nf3 may be, an intense search for alternatives has been made. By playing 3 Jlc4, or - even more radical - 3 5)c3 or 3 d4. White allows his opponent to play 3...QT14+. with the intent of proving this move to be a loss of time. While is confident that the gain of tempo by £tf3, chas- ing the queen away from h4, will compensate fully for the loss of the right to castle. Of course, it takes a truly admirable self- confidence to play a move like 3 Qc3 and calmly meet 3...Qh4+ with 4 &K2 as if this was the most natural thing in the world, expecting the king to be able to take care of himself. But it says something about the underlying strength of this idea that only a really sharp reaction with 4...d5 5 Qxd5 Bg4+ 6 <2M'3 Jld6 (or even
6..?2)c6) is supposed to be adequate.
Compared to this, 3 Bc4 (N), almost looks tame. This is the Bishop's (Jambit, considered a fully acceptable alternative to 3 $Jf3. After this bishop move, White can meet 3...Rh4+ civilly with 4 'ATI. Here too. 4...d5 (or 3...d5 4 Bxd5 Rh4+) is a major option. Black sacrifices his d-pawn in order to open files and diagonals, giving his pieces plenty of scope, and opening the way for a solid protection of his f4-pawn af- ter 5 Bxd5 jLd6. 4...g5 is a much riskier way of doing so. Here a strange echo can be heard of the prehistoric variation that was mentioned in
330 FUNDAMENTAL CHESS OPENINGS
the introduction to this chapter: after 5 d4 Jfg7 6 <2te3 )e7 the bold 7 g3 ! fxg3 8 S&*g2! gets Black's queen into serious trouble. A solid alternative is to omit 3...Rh4+ and prepare ...d5 without sacrificing a pawn. 3...Qf6
4 Qc3 c6, with the idea to play 5...d5 (and the
cunning threat of 5...b5 6 Jlb3 b4!) is a widely respected variation. It is characteristic of this type of position that Black is not prevented from playing 5...d5 by 5 Re2. After the further 6 exd5+ Jle7 Black simply continues his de- velopment, White's material gain is of little significance and White's queen is vulnerable to attack. We now return to the position after 3 f3
(D)-.
for supremacy in the centre and avoids weak- ening pawn moves (like ...g5). Most of the alternatives (and there are quite a few of them!) can be classified somewhere in between these two extremes. Black is usually trying either to combine them or to refine one of them. For instance, 3...h6 the Becker Defence, is a subtle attempt to carry out a ...g5 plan, without having to worry about the implications of 3...g5
4 h4 g4 5 £je5. After 3...h6 4 d4 Black plays
4...g5(D).
Having already played ...h6. he is now in a position to meet 5 h4 with 5.. Jtg7, holding on to his g5-pawn and thus indirectly to f4 as well. This means that White will have to look for al- ternative ways of breaking up Black's pawn- chain on the kingside. The radical g3 plays a crucial part in this variation. White can either 'simply' play 5 g3 fxg3 6 hxg3 or 5 "2)c3 Bg7 6 g3, when after 6...fxg3 both 7 hxg3 and 7 h4!? have been tried. In all of these lines White makes no attempt to regain his pawn. He is purely playing for the initiative, quite in the spirit of the King's Gambit.
3...d6 is based on a similar idea, for here too
Black is preparing to play ...g5 under more fa- vourable circumstances. This is the Fischer Defence. After 4 d4 g5 5 h4 Black has no ob- jection to playing 5,..g4, having eliminated the response Qe5. Practice has shown, however, that even having to play the unorthodox 6 *22Bg1 (D) does not really diminish White's attacking chances. This is the departing point for some highly dissimilar variations. It is up to Black to deter- mine the character of the upcoming middle- game and he should do so decisively, or else White will simply play 4 d4 and 5 Jixf4 and be very happy with the result of the opening. The oldest move known to theory, called the Classical Variation, is 3...gS. Although it bears the stamp of the romantic spirit of the King's Gambit's heyday, this is still the main line even today. It is a principled attempt to refute the King's Gambit completely. On the other side of the spectrum we find
3...d5. the Modern Variation. This move was
never seriously investigated until far into the 20th century, when players began to look for a logical, purely positional treatment of the opening. Black concentrates on the struggle
KING'S GAMBIT 331
After 6... .h6 7 <2)c3 c6 8 "2jge2 Rf6, for in- stance, it is 9 g3! again which allows White ei- ther to break open the kingside (9...fxg3 10 53xg3) or to immobilize Black's pawns and ob- tain a stronghold at f4 (9...f3 10 £rf4). A completely different approach to the open- ing underlies 3...Be7. the Cunningham Gam- bit. Black intends to force White's king away from el with 4... ,h4+, a motif we already know from the Bishop's Gambit. Now, anyone who remembers that a master of the King's Gambit does not flinch from playing 3 Bc4 Rh4-t- 4 Qfl , will understand that the prospect of having to play 3 Nf3 Jke7 4 Bc4 ±h4+ 5 &fl holds very little terror indeed in the eyes of such a person. But there is a deeper and more modem aspect to the Cunningham which must be noted: after 4 Bc4 Black can simply play 4,..*2Bf6. meeting 5 e5 with 5...Ng4 6 O-O d5 7 exd6 Qxd6. This is in fact a subtle variation on the theme of 3...d5. the Modern Variation. The same goes for 3...Ne7, a move which hardly has a past (quite exceptional in the King's Gambit), but is very likely to have a future. It has become fairly popular in a very short period of time. The idea is to meet 4 d4 with 4...d5 (protecting f4 with 4...4)g6 is risky after 5 h4) 5 'Nc.3 dxe4 6 *Nxe4 <2)d5. Black has reached a position akin to the Modern Variation, having avoided the theoretical obstacles that lie in the way of the immediate 3...d5. Classical Variation 3 ... g5 (D) This move is as old as the King's Gambit it- self. Without any qualms about weakening his own position, Black rushes forward to combine the defence of f4 with an attack of his own. He is threatening 4...g4 and, if the knight moves,
5...Rh4+.
4 h4 This may look like a wild move, but it is in fact perfectly solid. While defuses the threat of
4...g4 and ingeniously forces Black to go ahead
with his plan regardless, only now it will be on White's terms. That is why White does not wait for Black to play ...Bg7, which would allow him to support his g5-pawn with ...h6. Now. the boot is on the other foot. Bur is it really? Another idea is to play the aggressive devel- oping move 4 Ji.c4. This loo does not exactly prevent Black from playing 4...g4. only the idea is a little different. Instead of safeguarding his knight, White is planning to sacrifice it with the nonchalant 5 O-O. This is the Polerio Gambit (also known as the Muzio Gambit), one of the very oldest theoretical variations of this ancient opening. White raises the stakes from a pawn to a piece. Today's chess-players will be so unac- customed to the extremely high level of inten- sity of this approach that they will probably blink and not understand what has hit them. So utterly estranged have we become from this sort of gambit play that we just cannot believe ill And yet. no refutation has ever been found. Let us look at the starting position, which arises after 5,..gxf3 6 Qxf3 (D). Once this was called 'the classical position of the King's Gambit'. To offer the reader a
332 FUNDAMENTAL CHESS OPENINGS
solid 4...Jlg7 (instead of 4...g4) Black keeps things simple and clear, emphasizing normal de- velopment rather than further material gains. Af- ter 5 h4 he plays 5...h6 6 d4 d6. meeting 7 c.3, for example, with 7...&C6 8 Rb3 Re7. White's sharpest attempt is a plan that we have seen in the Becker Defence (3...h6): 5 O-O d6 6 d4 h6 7 c3 4fc6 and now 8 g.3. Although Black's play in this variation so far may be called solid, it is clear that there is no question of this position be- ing boring. After 8...g4 9 '2Bh4 f3 10 Nd2 a piece sacrifice on f3, clearing die way to Black's king, is in the air. 4 ... g4 (D) If 4...gxh4 5 d4. White easily regains both pawns and obtains the initiative for free. li brief glimpse of what is possible here (but then what does the term 'possible' mean really?) I shall outline just a few of the many variations: The most critical move is 6...W6, which White meets with the pawn sacrifice 7 e5!? Qxe5. Although White can hardly be accused of having taken it easy so far, he now goes com- pletely berserk: to begin with, there is the varia- tion 8 Bxf7+!? ixf? 9 d4, sacrificing another piece and his remaining centre pawn just to speed up the development of his remaining pieces to the utmost. After 9... xd4+ 10 xe3!, followed, for instance, by 10...Rf6 II Jtxf4. Black finds himself facing a ferocious onslaught on his king. Compared to this, the alternative 8 d3, with the possible continuation 8...Jih6 9 <Nc3 <Se7 10 i.d2 <2)bc6 1 1 3ael Qf5 1 2 2)d5, looks almost unnaturally self-restrained. Both these lines have been minutely investigated, es- pecially in the late 19th century'. In fact, a book published as late as 1910 was devoted solely(!) to the latter variation, or to be precise to the po- sition arising after the further moves 1 2...'4d8
13 e2 (with the idea 13".4Bxd5 14 jNxd5
Qxd5 15 Ac3l). 6,..'"'e7 is also a perfectly plausible move. Again, White slams on the accelerator by 7 'S'xf4!, planning to meet 7...Qc5+ with 8 d4 Rxd4+ 9 Ae3 Qxc4 10 'te5+ and 1 1 Rxh8. But quite apart from the question what these variations are still worth today, the reason for the Polerio Gambit having undergone a process of fossilization has been the practical consideration that there is no need for Black to let himself be drawn into this strange world. By choosing the 5 Nearly all variations of the King's Gambit bear romantic names of legendary chess-players from a distant past. 5 *2Be5 is the Kieseritzky Gambit. A remarkable alternative is to play 5 sNg5, the Allgaier Gambit. White does not force the opponent into anything, yet he kindly invites him to win a piece by replying 5...h6. The idea is simply that Black's king gets drawn out of his comfort zone after 6 xf7 xf7. Again, I offer just a few variations to give the reader an idea of what is going on here. The obvious continua- tion 7 xg4 is not sufficiently incisive to jus- tify the piece sacrifice, for Black has a very easy way to develop his kingside pieces in
7..?2)f6 8 W'xf4 Ad6. Equally, 7 Ac4+ is not as
powerful as it looks, since Black will be only
KING'S GAMBIT 333
too happy to open the c8-h3 diagonal for his bishop with 7...d5! 8 Bxd5+ ?g7. The main line starts with the neutral developing move 7 d4. A possible (but not forced) reply to this is
7...f3, with the idea of meeting 8 gxf3 with
8...d5, trying to disorganize (and if possible
slow down) White's attacking machinery. We now return to 5 <?3e5 (D): position is intrinsically sound. This is a real test for the Classical Variation. Black is a pawn up. but his kingside has been weakened. White has no concrete threats yet in due course an attack along the f-file is to be expected. In the mean- time White has a space advantage and a beauti- ful square for his pieces at f4. The alternative 5...d6 is no less ancient, yet this move has only recently risen to the fore. Even more so than 5...€)f6, this move is an at- tempt to wrest the initiative from White. The idea is to meet 6 Nxg4 with 6...Nf6, when the

He is hoping to uti- lize the open g-file, bring his pieces quickly into play and use his 14-pawn to cramp the en- emy kingside. Modern Variation 3 ... d5 Throughout the 20th century, this move was recommended in chess literature as a simple way of maintaining a positional balance. This assessment should perhaps be slightly modi- fied. It is true that the opening problems are relatively simple in this line and that modern chess-players will probably feel more at home here than in a large section of the Classical Variation, but this is not necessarily to Black's advantage: it is a purely practical consideration, if Black has a superior understanding of the opening or if he is simply the better player, yes, he is almost certain to obtain a good position very easily. But if the opposite is true, he is equally likely to obtain a bad position. As in ev- ery other variation, there will be a struggle here, a struggle for the initiative and for domination of the centre. 4 exd5 In case of 4 e5 the classical move 4...g5 would now be much stronger than on the previ- ous move since after 5 h4 g4 White will be un- able to play 6 4he5.

This is the basic position of the Kieseritzky Gambit. Many moves for Black have been sug- gested, tried and discarded here. More in par- ticular, playing for material gains with moves like 5...h5 or 5...Jle7 meet with strong disap- proval in the books. 5...h5 6 Jtc4 2h7 7 d4 plays into White's hands, as does 5...Be7 6 Ac4 ,xh4+ 7 ti?f1 . Neutralizing White's initiative has to be Black's top priority and he does well not to worry about his extra pawn. 5...Nf6 is the tradi- tional main line. Against 6 ifc4 Black wants to play 6...d5 7 exd5 Jld6 (or 7...Jlg7). This leads, after 8 d4, to one of the crucial positions of the Kieseritzky Gambit. The material balance has been restored, but the positional balance is dif- ficult to evaluate. Black has yielded his oppo- nent an advantage in the centre but only to form a threatening and coherent pawn-front on the kingside. A characteristic continuation is

[diagram]
This variation is somewhat similar to the Scandinavian Defence (1 e4 d5). Black wants to recapture with the knight. If 4...Qxd5, White is given a valuable extra tempo for his develop- ment: 5 Nc3. Falkbeer Counter-Gambit 2 ... d5 This move was already mentioned in our oldest sources on the King's Gambit, but - be- ing judged primarily on the recapturing on d5 with the queen, it received little attention at the time. 3 exd5 (D) 1 his is the starting point ol the Modem Vari- ation. Black's last move is based on the as- sumption that protecting the d5-pawn with 5 c4 is ineffective because of 5...c6, when 6 dxc6? (6 d4 is correct) 6...5)xc6 7 d4 Jlg4 gives Black a beautiful, fast and aggressive way of develop- ing his pieces.
5 Bb5+ is a much subtler way of provoking
...c6. After 5...c6 6 dxc6 <2)xc6 7 d4 .d6 8 O-O O-O 9 <?)bd2 (intending to play Nc4 and c3) a characteristic sort of position has arisen. Black's opening strategy has succeeded so far in that he has developed his pieces fairly quickly and managed to hang on to f4. It is around this pawn that the ensuing struggle will now revolve. Will White be able to capture it, using, for instance, the manoeuvre 4fic4-e5 to cut off the d6-bishop from its defence, or will Black be able to use the f4-pawn for aggressive operations like ...Nd5- e3 or ...Q)e7-d5-e3'? This was the traditional main line of 3...d5 until around 1990 many players began to doubt whether it is really necessary to provoke ...c6 (giving White the opportunity to restore the material balance with dxc6). Nowadays it is 5 Jtc4 which is thought of as the main line. White lets his opponent play ...Nxd5 and is banking on fast development (again!). In short, he sacri- fices a pawn again, which - theoretically at Now' 3...Rxd5 offers White a tempo for free and looks unpromising after, for instance, 4 •Nc3 Qe6 5 fxe5 Qxe5+ 6 )Le2 followed by 7 d4 or 7 <5)1'3. It was not until Ernst Falkbeer (1819-85) published a theoretical article in 1850, explor- ing the merits of the much more ambitious
3...e4. that 2...d5 began to be appreciated. In the
following century, it turned out that there is an- other way of justifying 2...d5: 3...c6, In both cases Black ignores White's initial pawn sacri- fice and sacrifices a pawn himself, a radical way of trying to turn the tables on White. We shall examine these two lines below. A fourth option (and a perfectly valid one) is to play 3...exf'4, After 4 4)f3 this leads to the Modem Variation. The point of this move- order is that Black avoids the Bishop's Gambit (3 Xc4).
KING'S GAMBIT 335
this endgame Black will no doubt regain his pawn (he can do so immediately by taking on c2). but mainly owing to the vulnerable posi- tion of his king at e7. White is likely to retain the initiative.
3...e4
3 ... e4 Falkbeer's move. In the same way as in the Albin Counter-Gambit (1 d4 d5 2 c4 e5 3 dxe5 d4; see page 50) Black boldly occupies the cen- tre. White's second move. 2 f4, intended to open the f-file, now works against him: the pawn is not overly useful on f4 and White is vulnerable on the h4-ei and a7-gl diagonals. If White does not tread carefully. Black will strengthen his e4-pawn and push White onto the defensive. 4 d3 White takes the bull by the horns. Now the straightforward 4...Qxd5 is not sufficiently powerful, for White takes over the initiative again by playing 5 Re2 Nf6 6 Nc3 alb4 7 Bd2 Jcxc3 8 Ji.xc3. 4 ... Qf6 5 dxe4 Nxe4(7))
3...c6
3 ... c6 (D) This move was proposed early in the 20th century by Aron Nimzowitsch, but never re- ceived full recognition until about 1985, when it suddenly became all the rage. Nowadays, this is one of the main replies to the King's Gambit. It is a more modem interpretation of the Falk- beer than 3...c4. and closely related to the Mod- em Variation (2...exf4 3 Qf3 d5). Taking advantage of the e5-pawn still being immune from capture because of 4...Qh4+, Black offers two different pawn sacrifices him- self, for White can either simply play 4 dxc6 or the more sophisticated 4 Qe2. In both cases. Black is happy with the small lead in develop- ment that he enjoys after 4 dxc6 £txc6 or 4 Qe2 cxd5 5 xeS-h 3Lcl (when 6 Qxg7?? loses the queen to 6.. Bf6 7 Qg3 Bh4). Il is also important that White cannot simply play the developing move 4 f3, because that would make the advance 4.,.e4 really attractive. It is another knight move that has become the main line:
4 Nc3
If now 4...cxd5 then 5 fxe5 is possible. It is true that after 5...d4 6 £sc4 Rd5 7 d3 (or 7 Jld3) This position has been considered crucial for the 'old' Falkbeer Counter-Gambit for a long time now. There can be no doubt about Black having 'some' initiative for the pawn, but in spite of this 3...e4 seems to have lost its popu- larity. The reason for this decline must be that the general assessment 'some' becomes 'not quite enough' when minutely investigated. What was once a romantic and chivalrous way of meeting the King's Gambit has boiled down to a highly rational examination of the variation 6 Qf3 Bc5 7 Qe2 Af5 8 5)c3 Re7 9 Jce3 i.xe3 10 'xe3 Nxc3 1 1 Qxe7+ Bxe7 12 bxc3.

to be intimidated (and play 2...d6). By placing his king's bishop on the a7-gl diagonal, he makes a genuine effort to show up a darker side to the move 2 f4. yet at the same time he keeps play within the 'normal' range of 1 e4 e5 posi- tions. 3 £T3 dfi (D) Black regains his pawn, but this is likely to yield the initiative to White. 4 ... exf4 This move is much more ambitious, threat- ening 5...Wfh4+ again.
5 Ad6
It is odd that Black should play' ...c6 in this line and then consistently refuse to play ...cxd5 in the next few moves. One could easily be led to believe that there is no deeper idea behind this line than to provoke dxc6. But Black has a very good reason for postponing ...cxd5: after
5...cxd5 6 d4 it is difficult to defend f4 (6...Jld6
allows 7 <2Bxd5 and 6...g5? fails to 7 h4 or 7 Re2+!) and just like in the Modern Variation it is defending this very' pawn that is Black's pri- mary aim in this variation.
6 d4 Ne7 (D)
In this position White faces an important choice, one which is partly a matter of style and partly a question of sober analysis. The most plausible plan is probably to play 4 c3. intending to meet 4...Nf6 with 5 d4, gaining a tempo and closing the a7-gl diagonal to the bishop, so that castling kingside becomes pos- sible. The crucial question is whether Black can then make a breach in White's broad pawn- centre. Critical, for instance, is 5...exd4 6 cxd4 Nb4+ 7 J'.d2 Nxd2+ 8 Nbxd2 Re7 and also the sharp 4...f5 is a real test for 4 c3. Theory has (as usual) not been able to reach a final verdict on these lines. The alternative is simply to keep on develop- ing pieces, starting with 4 €)c3. White does not worry' about the problem of how to castle, and concentrates on other matters. After 4...£jf6 5 Bc4 >R3c6 6 d3 Jlg4. for example, there is 7 Na4. eliminating the bishop. If Black plays
6...a6 (creating a7 as a retreat-square), then 7 1'5
is a possibility. White bottles up Black's queen's bishop and prepares an attack on the kingside based on the advance g4-g5. This is the basic position of the 'modem' Falkbeer Counter-Gambit. A very similar type of struggle to the Modern Variation is develop- ing. Will White be able to capture on f4. or will this pawn remain a thorn in White's side? King's Gambit Declined 2 ...

Black re- fuses to be provoked by 2 f4 but he also refuses Other 1 e4 e5 Openings
1 e4 e5 (D)
Due to its long and interesting history, the theory of 1 e4 e5 has become rather frag- mented. Several second- and third-move op- tions for both White and Black have been given a name and a place of their own in the great body of opening theory. We have seen the most impor- tant of these in the previous six chapters and will now turn our attention to the remaining ones. There are two other possibilities, admittedly of somewhat lower theoretical rank (from a mod- em point of view, that is), but which are playable nevertheless. These are 2...d6, the Philidor De- fence, and 2...f5, the Latvian Gambit. The Damiano Defence. 2...f6?. also deserves a mention (but no more than that), not because of any inherent merit of the move (there is none - even the apparent idea, which is to protect e5, is illusory for White is actually invited to start hacking away with 3 4)xe5! fxe5 4 Qh5+), but as a tragic case of totally misguided name- giving: Pedro Damiano, a Portuguese player living in the 16th century, did not recommend this move: he strongly disapproved of it. And for this sensible judgement he got his name at- tached to it.' Turning back to the position after 1 e4 e5. the next question is whether there are any alterna- tives to 2 *2hf3 and 2 f4, the two moves we have looked at so far. Indeed there are. 2 <5)c3 is the Vienna Game and 2 -sLc4 is the Bishop's Opening. These are respectable openings with a long history. And we conclude this chapter with 2 d4, the Centre Game, where White opens the centre immedi- ately. Ponziani Opening
2 Nf3 foc6
3 c3 (D)
This opening, named after Domenico Ponzi- ani (1719-96), enjoyed a certain amount of popularity in the 19th century, but it came to be completely overshadowed by the Ruy Lopez, where White carries out the same plan in more favourable circumstances. Because White does not put any pressure on the enemy position first (as with 3 Jfb5), Black is given the opportunity to react aggressively to c3. for instance with 3...d5, This move is in fact
2 W3 is White's most popular move in this
position and 2...£k6 is Black's most popular reply. The lion's share of 1 e4 e5 theory is based on this position, most of it starting with the four moves we have already looked at: 3 Jfb5. 3 Bc4, 3 d4 and 3 <2}c3. Naturally, everyone is free to prefer a calm little move like 3 Jle2. 3 d3 or 3 g3, but this im- plies saying goodbye to the world of opening theory, for there has never been any 'official' interest in any of these moves. The only alterna- tive that does have its niche alongside the Big Four is 3 c3. the Ponziani Opening. White pre- pares d4 by making cxd4 possible should Black play ...exd4. This is a motif we know from the Ruy Lopez and the Italian Game. As an alternative to 2...Nc6, we have so far only investigated 2...<<)f6. the Petroff Defence.
338 FUNDAMENTAL CHESS OPENINGS
theory. In fact, the adaptability of this opening is truly astonishing. Throughout the centuries a new interpretation of the Philidor has always been found whenever new positional views demanded this. A theoretical overview of the variations of the Philidor is very much a dis- play of how opening theory has changed over the years.
3 d4 (D)
not often played, probably because 1 e4 e5 players who only get to face the Ponziani once or twice in their careers are not usually well- prepared for it and are a little worried about the critical reply 4 Ra4. Besides, there is the sim- ple and solid alternative 3...£tf6. If we compare this position to the Ruy Lopez (for example. 3 Ab5 a6 4 Ji.a4 5 O-O Ne7 6 Sei b5 7 Nb3 d6 8 c3, where White has protected his e-pawn before he even embarks on the c3 plan) the Ponziani hardly creates a favourable impres- sion. Nevertheless, even after 3 c3 there is still room for White to try to achieve an opening ad- vantage and for this reason the Ponziani has never died out. After 4 d4 Nxe4, for instance, 5 d5 may give White some spatial advantage. Whether this is of any importance after, say.
5...2)e7 6 A)xe5 Ng6 is another matter.
The oldest move in this position is 3...f5, the choice of Philidor himself. Black attacks White's central position without fear of overex- tending himself. This variation was considered a highly crucial one until deep into the 19th century. Especially the position that arises after 4 dxe5 fxe4 5 ;?3g5 d5 6 c6 was hotly debated (and still is) and the piece sacrifice 4 *2)03 fxe4 5 <?)xe4 d5 6 €}xe5 dxe4 7 Rh5+ also greatly oc- cupied the masters of old. In fact, a clear refuta- tion of 3...f5 has never been found, but the trust, the basic trust required to play a very sharp move like this, has just deteriorated over the years. With the rise of modem positional chess in the latter part of the 19th century, a more heavy-handed, more defensively orientated ap- proach to the Philidor rose to the fore: 3...Nd7. Black protects his e-pawn without exposing his queen's knight at c6 to a pin (Jib5) or a direct attack (d5). This is a choice in favour of a slightly compressed yet very solid position. But it soon became clear that this admirable plan meets with great practical difficulties, for if White plays 4 Bc4 Black needs to be very careful indeed. The unsuspecting 4...5)gf6?, for Philidor Defence 2 2)f3 d6 This opening deserves our attention if only because it bears the name of one of the most fa- mous chess-players of all time, .Andre Philidor (1726-95). Philidor did not like to obstruct his pawns and for this reason he preferred 2...d6 to 2...'$)c6. He was very consistent in his views for he also considered 2 3f3 a mistake which begged for severe punishment with 2...d6 3 d4 1'5. Although this radical view never found a great following and the chess world went back to 2...Cic6 en masse after him, the Philidor Defence itself re- tained its special place in the world of opening OTHER 1 e4 e5 OPENINGS 339 detour. By playing l...d6 2 d4 Nf6 3 92Bc3 e5 4 Nf3 <2)bd7 Black reaches the Philidor Defence via the back door. Apparently then, in order to reach this classical 1 e4 e5 position. Black needs to abandon l...e5! Unavoidably there are some pitfalls and complications even to this detour (though nothing as serious as with
3...£jd7 and 3..Xbf6). We shall examine them
in the chapter on the Pirc Defence (see page 453). Finally, the most modem interpretation of the Philidor is to play 3...exd4, This solution to the problem of how to protect e5 is as radical as it is simple, yet it was thought to be too passive for a very long time. But general considerations like this (which tend to become dogmatic) do not seem to impress today's players. On the contrary, it makes them want to take a closer look at the variation involved. After 4 Nxd4 Black continues 4...Nf6 5 <2)c3 .Ne7. White has a spatial advantage but Black's position is very flexible. After 6 Ae2 O-O 7 O-O. for instance, he can either adopt a wait-and-see attitude with
7...fie8 and 8...Ji.f8, or he can open hostilities
on the queenside with ...a6 and ...b5 or even ...c5. A counter-thrust in the centre, ...d5, is also hovering over the position. Latvian Gambit
2 Nf3 f5 (D)
This rowdy pawn sacrifice is one of the very few openings that never get a neutral qualifica- tion, not even in the most careful of opening books. The Latvian knows only two categories of chess-players: those who are for it (a handful of enthusiastic fans) and those who are against (the rest of the world). It is very old (it was mentioned by Greco as far back as 1669, and indeed is sometimes called the Greco Counter- Gambit) but has always had to live on the fringes of opening theory. And what a nerve: Black not only leaves e5 unprotected but even puts another pawn en prise as well! The point of 2..T5 is of course to meet 3 exf'5 with 3...e4, attacking the f3-knight. It is significant for the extraordinarily weak posi- tional foundation of the Latvian Gambit that instance, is severely punished by 5 dxe5 dxe5 6 Ng5 and 4...±e7? 5 dxe5 *?)xe5 (5...dxe5? 6 Rd5 is even worse) 6 <Lixe5 dxe5 7 'stfh5 is also quite unsatisfactory. The only way to survive these hazards is 4...c6 5 O-O Be7. but even then 6 dxe5 dxe5 7 "5)g5! Axg5 8 Qh5 g6 9 ' 'xg5 disrupts Black's opening plan. But although the latter variation is thought to be somewhat an- noying for Black, it is by no means a refutation of3...<2)d7. Still, a subtle refinement of Black's idea was found in 3...Nf6. But even this is not as rock solid as Black would like because of 4 dxe5. when after 4...Qxe4 the aggressive 5 Rd5 cS
6 Jl,g5 is a realistic attempt to turn a tiny lead in
development into a tangible initiative. What Black is really hoping to achieve with either 3,..€)d7 or 3...?3f6 is the position after
3...Nf6 4 Nc3 <2)bd7. Play might continue 5
jLc4 (the traditional move, but the extraordi- nary' 5 g4!? has been popular in recent years)
5...jLe7 6 O-O O-O (D), when we arrive at what
surely is the fundamental Philidor position. White has more space but it is very difficult to launch an attack against Black's fortress. After 7 Sei c6 8 a4, for instance, Black can solve the problem of finding a proper way to develop his queen's bishop with 8...b6 fol- lowed by 9...Ab7. And remarkably enough, despite the objec- tions to both 3...Nd7 and 3...C)f6 outlined above, this remains a topical variation, for it so happens that there is a third route to the dia- grammed position, or perhaps I should say: a
340 FUNDAMENTAL CHESS OPENINGS
even this is a dubious line. 4 <2Be5 5 Ne2, for instance, is pretty dangerous for Black. But naturally, allowing White to play 3 <Nxe5 is even more perilous, for this brings up the threat of 4 Rh5+. The idea is to play 3...Qf6 first, neutralizing this threat, and then restore the material balance by taking on e4. Admit- tedly, this solves Black's immediate problems, but whether Black has much to be satisfied about in the long run, say after 4 d4 d6 5 Nc4 fxe4 or 4 <2te4 fxe4, is another matter. White has a considerable lead in development and Black has to be careful to avoid pitfalls like 4 Nc4 fxe4 5 <2jc3 Rg6 6 d3 exd3? (6...3lb4 is a better move) 7 Jlxd3 Qxg2'?? 8 Rh5+, when White is already winning. What is required to play the Latvian Gambit with any degree of success is a sharp eye for tactics and a mental attitude of total contempt for whatever theory has to say about it. Vienna Game 2 <2)c3 (D) When compared to 2 4)f3 and 2 f4, this is a quiet move. White does not attack anything, nor does he put pressure on his opponent in any way. But it is a perfectly useful developing move and White gives no guarantee whatsoever that he will not become aggressive at a later stage (which may be as early as the next move). The Vienna Game gained its independence in the second half of the 19th century, a time when players were still thinking along the lines of the King's Gambit (though not playing it as often as they used to do): 2 '-he3 was seen as a sensible preparation for 3 f4. About a century later, attention shifted to a quieter approach: 3 Nc4, a line that Bent Larsen used to be successful with in the 1950s and 1960s.
3 g3 is perfectly playable as well, and this
gained popularity later still, around the turn of the millennium. It is for these three plans that Black now has to brace himself. He also needs to anticipate a possible change of tack by his opponent, who can still play 3 4hf3 and then perhaps 4 d4.
2...Bc5, for instance, has to be judged by the
implications of 3 £jf3 d6 (if 3...Qc6 then 4 Nxe5!; see page 318) 4 d4 exd4 5 Nxd4. We are touching upon the bedrock of the entire Vi- enna Game here, for it was a theoretical discus- sion of the merits of 2...Nc5 around 1850 that sparked off interest in 2 -?ric3 in the first place. Naturally it was not the prosaic 3 Nf3 that ex- cited the masters of old. What occupied them was the question of whether on 3 #)a4 Black can successfully sacrifice a piece with 3... .xf2+ 4 Qxf2 Qh4+. Nowadays 2...4)f6 and 2...<hc6 are the main lines, each with a very specific point of its own.
2...W6
2 ... S)f6 (D) From this position start the main lines of the Vienna Game: 3 f4. 3 *,c4 and 3 g3. Naturally, 3 <2)f3 is also a perfectly good move, but this takes us back to the Petroff OTHER 1 e4 e5 OPENINGS 341 Defence (see page 322), or to the Four Knights Game in case Black plays 3...Nc6 (see page 318).
2...Nf6 3 f4
3 f4 At first sight, this sharp move may look more dangerous for Black now than a move earlier, since 3...exf4? is very strongly met by 4 e5. But those who have already acquainted themselves with the dos and don'ts of the King's Gambit will immediately recognize that this is the per- fect opportunity for Black to react in the spirit of the Falkbeer Counter-Gambit: 3 ... d5 Now 4 exd5 can be met by 4...e4, directly transposing to the Falkbeer Counter-Gambit, yet in a relatively favourable version for Black, for after 2 f4 d5 3 exd5 e4 (see page 335), 4 d3 is thought to be more accurate than 4 4Lc3 since in the latter case, after 4...Qf6 (and this is the position we arc dealing with here) 5 d3, Black has the powerful 5...Ab4. Another possibility for Black is to play the Modern Variation- inspired 4...exf4, while the simple 4...R)xd5 is not a bad move either. But then the critical reply to 3...d5 is not 4 exd5... 4 fxe5 2)xe4 (D) This brings about the crucial position of the
3 f4 variation.
In the long am White may well get attacking chances on the kingside thanks to the half-open f-file and his outpost at e5. But for the time being Black, with easy development to look forward to (beautiful open diagonals for both bishops), has little to worry about. Both play- ers' immediate concern will be Black's e4- knight: White needs to eliminate this aggressor, but how should he tackle this problem without compromising his own development? If 5 ,5)xe4 dxe4, the e4-pawn causes even more problems. A more subtle solution is to play 5 d3 al- though this is a slight concession for after
5...Nxc3 6 bxc3 Black has 6,..d4, which pre-
vents White from supporting his e5-pawn by playing 7 d4. The sharp 5,..Qh4+ is not to be feared for after 6 g.3 Nxg3 7 <7)f3 Rh5 8 Nxd5 the damage to Black's position is at least as se- rious as the damage to White's. 5 '2sf3 is also a main line. White eliminates
5...Rh4+ and intends to undermine the e4-
knight while developing healthily with 6 d4 and 7 Jld3. Laudable as this plan is, it is hardly dangerous for Black, since he has 5...Jle7 6 d4 O-O 7 jt.d.3 f5 8 exf6 Bxf6!, when taking twice on e4 loses a piece to 10...2e8.

This move is very similar to 2 <?)c3 in outlook. White prevents ...d5 and prepares f4. Black now faces an important choice. 3 ... Nc6 I give this move as the main line here, be- cause the position that arises if White now plays 4 d3 is of vital importance for several move-orders. But for a sober judgement of the
342 FUNDAMENTAL CHESS OPENINGS
specific move-order that we are dealing with here, the sharp 3...Nxe4 is at least as important as 3...€k6. We have seen this motif - the sacri- fice of a knight at e4 (or e5) followed by the fork ...d5 (or d4) winning back the piece imme- diately - in several forms by now. This time the implications are fairly unique, for it is not the one-dimensional 4 Qxe4 d5 nor 4 Jkxf7+ tf?xf7
5 Nxe4 d5 that theory is interested in (these
lines would only serve to justify 3...$)xe4). but the very dangerous 4 Rh5 Black is forced to respond 4...£sd6, when White, instead of going for the meek 5 Rxe5+ 4e7. plays 5 Jlb3 !, sac- rificing a pawn. The idea is to meet 5.,.€k6 (5...Be7 is simpler and safer, but less challeng- ing) with 6 <2Bb5, when 6...g6 7 'Nf3 f5 8 Rd5 Qe7 9 4)xc7+ Qd8 10 Nxa8 b6 (D) takes us to the starting position of what is sometimes called the Frankenstein-Dracula Variation. Just like a move earlier, Black now has
4...j>Lc5, inviting a transposition to the King's
Gambit Declined with 5 f4. He can also dis- courage 5 f4 by playing 4...Nb4, when 5 f4 runs into the powerful 5...d5. The most drastic way of giving this variation a face of its own. however, is to play 4...Na5, seizing the opportunity to eliminate the white bishop. The most critical reply is probably 5 Bge2 Nxc4 6 dxc4. White gets a firm grasp on the crucial d5-square to compensate for the dis- appearance of his bishop. This is a rather slow sort of position, where it is not easy for either player to create a breach in the enemy fortress.

But when the variation was first thoroughly investigated, around 1990. things turned out to be not quite as straightforward as that. For after 4 exd5 Nxd5 5 Bg2, and now, for instance, 5...$Jxc3 6 bxc3 7 Nf3 Bc5 8 9-0 O-O 9 Sei, there are several ways of attack- ing Black's central formation: a well-timed d4 for instance, or the more prudent d3 in combi- nation with <2)d2, opening the diagonal for the g2-bishop. And if Black prepares ...d5 with 3...c6, he is rather inviting his opponent to take the initia- tive in the centre himself with 4 d4 exd4 5 #xd4, now that 5...53C6 is no longer possible. Naturally, Black does not have to try to re- fute 3 g3. There is no objection at all to playing something simple like 3...AcS 4 Jcg2 ?3c6, keeping the centre closed for the time being. Both sides will be able to complete their devel- opment in peace. Here too the plan to play f4 - the main theme of the Vienna Game - after due preparation of course, remains crucial.
2...&C6
2 ... £sc6 (D) If White prefers one of the other standard plans, the difference between 2...£k6 and
2...<2)f6 is less significant and may even be re-
duced to zero. After 3 Bc4 Nf6, for instance, we find our- selves on familiar ground. But playing 2...Nc6 does of course mean that there is no possibility of meeting 3 Jlc4 with 3...Nxe4. In case of 3 g3, Black's choice is also limited compared to the sister variation 2...Nf6 3 g3. There is of course nothing wrong with some- thing like 3...fLc5 4 jig2 *$3f6 (this position is identical to the one arising after 2...£jf6 3 g3 fLc5 4 Jcg2 Q>c6), but 3...d5 and 3...c6 are no longer feasible. 3 41f3 transposes to the Three Knights Game (see page 318). 3 ... exf4 Black accepts the gambit and in so doing creates a type of middlegame which is similar to the King's Gambit Accepted. But the only difference from the position after 2 f4 cxf4 (the extra moves Nc3 and ...5)c6) has more signifi- cance than one might think. 4 2Bf3 Much more than in the comparable position after 2 f4 exf4, the fearless d4 is a major option here. In fact 4 d4 was very popular in the 19th century and is named the Steinitz Gambit, af- ter the first world champion. It must be admit- ted though that the reputation of this bold gambit has declined and that it will probably take a new Steinitz to reinvigorate White's chances after 4...Qh4+ 5 <Ne2 d6 6 <2)f3 .g4. 4 ... g5 (D) The advantage (from White's point of view) of <2)c3 and ...Nc6 having been played is that Black does not have as wide a choice as after 2 f4 exf4 3 QJf3, for he has to act quickly to pre- vent White from playing 5 d4 followed by 6 d5, and 4...d5 is not an option. The disadvantage is that Black docs not really need an alternative to ...g5. Since White cannot play the relatively solid Kieseritzky Gambit (solid in King's Gambit terms that is: 2 f4 exf4 3 4)f3 g5 4 h4 g4 5 QJe5) he has no alternative but to muster all the courage and audacity that he can find and go all-out for the 19th century approach: no holds barred. This move is usually played with the inten- tion of meeting the advance of White's f-pawn in a way which is very different from 2...'2',f6 3 f4 d5 as outlined above. 3 f4

advantage, a closer scrutiny of old variations such as these can be highly recommended. Bishop's Opening 2 l.c4 (D) 5 h4
5 d4 is a major alternative. If then 5...g4, the
situation is similar to the Polerio Gambit (see page 331). White sacrifices a piece with 6 Bc4 and hopes to obtain more than enough compen- sation after 6...gxf3 in the shape of a lead in de- velopment. an attack and... mate. Just a little example, to get a first glimpse of the dangers of this sort of position: if 7 O-O? fxg2? Black is de- stroyed by 8 Nxf7+ *xf7 9 Rh5+ *g7 10 g4+ Nf7 1 1 Sxf4+ £sf6 12 Nd5. However, modern theory indicates that 7 O-O? is refuted by
7...2)xd4! 8 xf4 (8 Rxd4? Rg5!) 8..J.C5!,
and that White should try 7 Rxf3. This fear- some gambit, which nobody has the courage (or the foolishness) to play any more, is called the Pierce Gambit. 5 ... g4 6 53g5 A comparison between this and the Classical Variation of the King's Gambit reveals a neces- sity for White to use only the sharpest and riski- est weapons which the King's Gambit armoury has to offer. We find ourselves in Allgaier Gambit territory here (see page 332). By play- ing 6...h6. Black forces his opponent to sacri- fice a piece: after 7 <2}xf7 Qxf7 8 d4 the main lines are 8...d5 and 8...1'3. Like the Pierce Gambit, this variation (called the Hamppe-Allgaier Gambit) is not very pop- ular any more. Chess-players of the 21st century' have become estranged from this wild, reckless sort of gambit play. But for anyone interested in just learning something about the delicate balance between the initiative and a material This is an ancient move and one that was pre- ferred by Philidor to 2 <2Bf3. Before the rise of the Ruy Lopez, c4 was considered the best square for White's king's bishop anyway, so why not play Nc4 at once? In those days, the Bishop's Opening was a complicated theoreti- cal affair, consisting of a maze of intricate vari- ations. But most of these were firmly rooted in the strategic and tactical concepts of that era and are almost invisible today. And yet quite recently this has become a popular opening again, mainly because of the revaluation of the very quiet set-up based on 3 d3. In fact, the Bishop's Opening has under- gone the same transformation as the Italian: from an 'old-fashioned' opening full of fire- works to a modem, positionally well-founded alternative to the Ruy Lopez. And compared to the Italian Game, 2 .'*.c4 has the added advan- tage of avoiding the Pctroff Defence, a perhaps inconspicuous point but one that is much appre- ciated by manv 1 e4 players nowadays. 2 ' ... Nf6 To give the reader a faint idea of how antique theory of the Bishop's Opening looked like:
2...Nf6 used to be called the Berlin Defence,
while 2...Bc5 is (or was?) the Classical Varia- tion. White would then often continue 3 c3 Nf6 OTHER 1 e4 e5 OPENINGS 345 position from the Vienna that we have just seen, and 4 ?3f3, transposing to the Two Knights De- fence (see page 311). But the moment is ill- chosen to try to transpose to a King's Gambit, since 4 f4-gives Black a (relatively) comfort- able game after 4...exf4 5 Nxf4 d5l. If 3....&C5, White has the same choice, but this move is often played specifically with the idea of replacing ...£k:6 with a ...c6 set-up in case White continues 4 Nf3 d6 5 c3. Play might continue 5...i.b6 6 21bd2 O-O 7 O-O c6 8 -Bb3 Ne8 9 2el i.e6 10i.c2h6 11 h3 Nbd7, for in- stance. The mere fact that this opening has been impregnated with subtle considerations like this is a clear sign of how seriously the d3 and c3 plan is taken nowadays. I have elabo- rated on this trend in the chapter on the Italian Game and what I have said there goes for the Bishop's Opening as well. 4 2)f3 d5

2...b5 or 2...f5 (the Calabrian Counter-Gambit)
also used to have a prominent place in the books but have now completely disappeared. 3 d3(D) With this modest little move starts the mod- ern interpretation of the Bishop's Opening. 150 years ago it was 3 d4 that was considered critical and in fact this is one of the very few elements of the 'old Bishop's Opening' that is still relevant today.

Naturally, this line is crawling with transpo- sitions to both the Italian and the Vienna Game and each player will have to make use of these possibilities according to his own insight and preferences. After 3...<Nc6. for instance, White has a choice between 4 Nc3, transposing to a The history of this position nicely illustrates how opening theory works.

was dismissed with a curt '6...Ae6 and chances are equal'. And this was in a highly respected opening encyclopedia published in 1974! It was not until a few pioneers took up this line in the 1970s that a sensible body of variations be- gan to take shape and 5....Nd6 became the main

gave a similar description of (and prescription for) the related Goring Gambit. Another possibility is to play 3 Nf3. It seems odd to play the moves d4 and <2Bf3 in this order, giving Black a choice between the Scotch Open- ing (3... c6) and a line of the Petroff Defence (3. .,'23f6) and allowing some other moves (like
3..Bc5 and 3...Ab4+) as well. Nevertheless,
this is becoming more and more popular these days. The idea is to circumvent one of the main variations of the Petroff: after 3 QJf3 <R2sf6 Black has missed out on the popular line 2 ?)f3 Nf6 3 d4 'R3xe4 and has been tricked into the alternative line 3 d4 exd4 (see page 325) in- stead. 3 ... ?)Bc6

time, but this now seems to be thought a little over-subtle, for this move is hardly ever played any more. Centre Game
2 d4 exd4 (D)
White has opted for the central pawn-forma- tion which is typical of the Scotch. The only difference is the somewhat vulnerable position of his queen at e3 and the free development tempo ...Nc6 that Black has just cashed in. Still, White's opening play is not entirely un- founded. After, say, 4...<2hf6 5 Nc3 Ab4 6 O-O, thanks to his queen having been already developed. White has the aggressive option of castling queenside. After 7 O-O-O 2e8 he should not be frightened by the frontal attack against his e-pawn and continue in attacking style with

advisable for this allows Black to take the ini- tiative with 8...d51.

The double pawn sacrifice 3 c3 dxc3 4 J.c4 cxb2 5 Bxb2 was popular around 1900 and is called the Danish Gambit.

complications, which would have delighted the old masters of the 1 e4 e5 gambits! In fact, 1 ...e6, although known much earlier, first rose to the fore in the first half of the 19th century, probably as a reaction to the flood of fearsome gambit openings that washed over the classi- cal 1 ...e5 in those days, like the King's Gambit and the Evans. After a famous correspondence match between the cities of London and Paris in 1834, where the French team played l...e6. the name French Defence was coined and a new defence to 1 e4 was given a place on the map. Nowadays the French is a popular reply to 1 e4 at all levels. It is certainly useful to be at least roughly acquainted with some of the sharper variations, but generally a good positional un- derstanding is more important than ready theo- retical knowledge. Usually the result of the opening will be a strategically dynamic middle- game. in which positional considerations and long-term planning are likely to dominate. But below the surface there is often a volcano of tactical violence boiling, waiting to erupt at any moment. 2 d4 This is without a doubt White's most natural move, but it stands to reason that there are alter- native possibilities. An important one is 2 d3. White anticipates his opponent's plan: he wants to be able to re- capture on e4 with a pawn. This avoids such im- mediate skirmishing in the centre as may be expected from 2 d4 and stabilizes White's cen- tral position. By continuing after 2...d5 with 3 Nd2 (D). White avoids an exchange of queens and initiates a plan of development that is based on the King's Indian Defence: Nf3. g3 and Ng2. This is called the King's Indian Attack, a set-up that we have already met in the Rcti This perhaps slightly timid-looking move is in fact a clear signal that Black has different priorities from a classical l...e5 player. He changes the course of the opening immedi- ately. Black allows his opponent to form what is called 'the ideal pawn-centre' by playing 2 d4 and thereby voluntarily accepts a more cramped position than l...e5 would give. This may look like a disadvantage but the great benefit of this plan is that White is not given any targets. There is no black pawn at e5 begging to be at- tacked and the a2-g8 diagonal, so often Black's Achilles' Heel in the 1 e4 e5 openings, is firmly closed: there will be no white bishop leering at f7 in the French Defence! So the concession Black makes in terms of space is compensated for by improved secu- rity. But it is not passivity that marks Black's outlook on life in the French Defence. On the contrary, his plan is to play 2...d5, attacking White's e4-pawn, and it is very likely that ...c5 will soon follow, (probably) attacking a white pawn on d4 in similar fashion. This strategy can easily lead to a violent confrontation in the centre and with a little bit of luck (or is it bad

Opening. In fact, if play continues 3...<5'',f6 4 4igf3 Be7 5 g3 O-O 6 Jlg2 c5 7 O-O, we reach a position that was mentioned in the chapter on the Reti Opening as resulting from 1 d5 2 g3 Nf6 3 Ng2 e6 4 O-O Ae7 5 d3 O-O 6 &bd2 c5 7e4. Naturally, by playing a move like 2 d3, White leaves his opponent a free hand and Black has many options beside the above. Some of the most popular ones are to play 3...c5 4 ?3gf3 AJc6
5 g3 and now 5...Ad6 6 .iLg2 £jge7 or 5...g6 6
.lg2 Jcg7 7 O-O £jge7. In both cases Black makes the crucial e5 advance more difficult for White to achieve than if he plays 5.- 6. An- other frequently played move is the Sicilian op- tion: 2...c5. Most of these lines cannot really be said to belong exclusively to the French Defence. They are of at least equal importance to the flank openings (the Reti and 1 g3) and to the Sicilian Defence, especially the variation 1 e4 c5 2 A\f3 e6. where 3 d3 is a very popular option (see page 420). The King's Indian Attack is really a sort of unguided missile that roams free through- out the world of opening theory. It is a plan of development not tied to any particular move- order and more effective in some situations than in others. After I...e5 it has practically no significance to speak of, but as a way of com- bating the French, where Black has already committed himself to an ...e6 plan, it is rela- tively well-suited. Another popular option is the very odd 2 Re2 (D). a move that Chigorin (1850-1908) used to be fond of. It looks barbaric to prevent a recapture on d5 with the e-pawn after 2...d5 3 exd5 in such a primitive way, but in fact White is again prepar- ing for a King's Indian Attack, a scheme of de- velopment in which the move Qe2 fits rather well. If 2...c5 3 2)f3 Qc6 4 g3 g6 5 Ng2 Ng7 6 O-O 4hge7 7 d3 O-O 8 c3, for instance, a position is reached that will look perfectly ordinary to most King's Indian Attackers. These two moves (2 d3 and 2 Qe2) steer the game in a direction that is totally different from the main route 2 d4. Another possibility is to accept this main route as a guiding principle but to travel in that direction on a parallel road, not on the main road itself. Such a variation is 2 Nf3 d5 3 53c3 (or 2 4bc3 d5 3 Nf3. depending on how White intends to react to the Sicilian di- version 2...c5). While avoiding for the moment the real main lines of the French. White still takes advantage of their existence for in some cases he will certainly want to transpose. Thus, after 3...d4 4 Ne2 play takes on a wholly un- French character, but after 3...dxe4 4 Nxe4 3?jd7 5 d4 we find ourselves in a very ordinary Rubinstein Variation (see page 354). The most common reply is 3...5)f6, a move which illus- trates the pluses and minuses of this 'parallel variation' rather nicely: after 4 e5 <2hfd7 5 d4 c5 White has indeed circumvented enormous chunks of theory from the main lines, but what he has ended up with is a fairly innocuous sideline of the Steinitz Variation (see page 356).
2 Nf3 may also be played with a totally dif-
ferent idea, namely to meet 2...d5 with 3 e5,

Equally drastic but otherwise totally differ- ent is 3 e5. the Advance Variation. This line too has gained considerably in popularity of late and is now almost on a par with the real main lines of the French. 3 -?'Bc3 and 3 $)d2. Oddly enough, the former of these does not have a name, even though it is the starting move for the sharpest and most crucial variations of the entire French Defence. The latter, 3 ?)d2, is called Tarrasch Variation. There are hardly any alternatives to these four moves. 3 .S.d3 is possible but the position after 3...dxe4 4 Ji.xe4 Qf6 5 Jtd3 c5 is consid- erably more comfortable for Black than the comparable Rubinstein Variation (see page 353) and 3 f3 makes little sense, for after 3...dxe4 it impossible to reply 4 fxe4 in view of 4...Rh4+. Exchange Variation 3 exd5 This is undoubtedly the simplest solution to the problems raised by 2...d5, but the status of this variation is a singularly unusual one. In the middle of the 19th century, 3 exd5 was a fa- vourite with Paul Morphy (1837-84), and in the early 1990s it was a speciality of Garry Kaspar- ov. These are two of the very best chess-players the world has ever seen. But in the century and a half between those giants, the line was looked upon as a boring drawing variation. How to ex- plain this glaring contrast? 3 ... exd5 (D) The answer lies in the specific type of pawn- structure resulting from this obvious reply. intending to gambit a pawn if Black continues
3...c5: 4 b4'?. This is a bold yet positionally
well-founded sacrifice. After 4...cxb4 5 a3 bxa3 6 d4. White has diverted Black's c-pawn from attacking his own pawn on d4 and in so doing has strengthened his centre considerably. The idea of anticipating 2...d5 by playing 2 c4, which - as we shall see in the next chapter - occupies such a prominent position in the Caro- Kann Defence, is harmless against the French. After 3 exd5 exd5 4 cxd5 Nf6 5 Jlb5+ (analo- gous to the Caro-Kann) Black calmly replies
5...Nbd7 6 Nc3 i.e7 and, after 7 d4 O-O 8 <2)f3

After 3 Nc3 ?)c6 4 g3 g6 5 Bg2 Bg7 we have reached a position from the Botvinnik Variation ( 1 c4 c5 2 <2)c3 €)c6 3 g3 g6 4 Ji.g2 Ji.g7 5 e4 e6). 2 ... d5 (D) This is the real starting point of the French. It is also the first crisis in the opening battle, for White now has to make a fundamental decision with far-reaching consequences. He has several options of dealing with the threat against his e- pawn and every single one of them will to a great extent define the character of the forth- coming middlegame. By playing 3 exd5 White resolves the ten- sion immediately. This is the Exchange Varia- tion. which was regarded as a drawing weapon for a very long time until Garry Kasparov reha- bilitated the line in 1991.
350 FUNDAMENTAL CHESS OPENINGS
we know this symmetrical pawn-formation from the Petroff Defence. Although the posi- tion of a black knight on e4 and (in the 3 d4 variation) a white knight on e5 adds some extra tension to the Petroff (in particular the uncer- tainty whether these knights are well-placed), the situation is basically the same. Whoever wants to be successful in a position like this has to have a highly-developed intuitive sense of the initiative and extremely good technical skills. In short, he has to be able, like Moses, to beat water out of a rock. This was a talent that both Morphy and Kasparov were gifted with to an un- usual degree, but for the ordinary mortal things are different. It must be admitted, therefore, that most people who choose the Exchange Variation as White are simply out for safety and in many cases - let us not beat about the bush - for an easy draw. Both Morphy and Kasparov preferred the sturdy developing move 4 <R3f3 (D) in this posi- tion. disorganization caused by the two queens stand- ing on e2 and e7 than White's, for While can develop his king's bishop harmoniously at g2 by playing g4.

Both cxd5 and c5 can be nasty for Black, while 5...dxc4 6 ,SLxc4 transposes to a line of the Queen's Gambit Accepted (1 d4 d5 2 c4 dxc4 3 e3 e5 4 Jlxc4 exd4 5 exd4 jLd6 6 <23f3; see page 40), which not every 'French' player will be happy with. At any rate, these lines are more powerful than the immediate 4 c4. This move is also sometimes played, but it hardly sets the oppo- nent any problems after 4...?Bf6 5 <2}c3 Jle7 or
5...Ab4. Once theory really starts to dig into a
line, such minimal differences (as between 4 c4 and 4 <2)f3 .Nd6 5 c4) often turn out to be quite serious. Throughout the 20th century, most opening books gave 4 Jld3 and even the symmetrical
4...Ad6 5 Ne2 <?3e7 as the main line. This is
based on defensive thinking: both players are worried about the possible pins Bg5 and ..Jtg4 respectively, so they decline to develop their knights at their most aggressive squares f3 or f6.

A major strategic motif characteristic of this type of closed position comes to the fore if Black plays 4...Rb6 5 2)f3 Bd7. The idea is to exchange bishops with 6...Bb5, very desirable from a purely positional or static point of view. White has two options. He can simply allow Black to carry out his plan and make the best of it (after all, White does retain his spatial advan- tage) or he can play the sharp 6 Ae2 Jcb5 7 c4!?, seeking to open the position.

Long-term planning is likely to dominate the opening phase and indeed the rest of the game. Considerations of fast and efficient piece devel- opment become subordinate to finding the right plan and anticipating the enemy's movements. The Advance Variation is very old and was quite important in the 19th century, but it fell into disrepute until Nimzowitsch revitalized it around 1910. Nevertheless, despite his efforts the line was often seen as a somewhat indolent way of playing and as a mere ploy to avoid the great main lines of the French. But towards the end of the 20th century this attitude changed. More and more top players began to take an in- terest in 3 e5 and its variations began to be ex- plored deeper and with more precision and sharpness. I think it is fair to say that due to these efforts the Advance Variation has now be- come one of the main lines of the French. 5 ... Qb6 (D) The classical approach. Black continues to attack d4, while keeping b2 covered as well, making it difficult for White to develop his queen's bishop. Naturally, in the wave of popu- larity that has swept the Advance Variation dur- ing the past two decades, a thorough search has been made for possible alternatives at practi- cally every turn. This has resulted in 5...Bd7 becoming a major option. This is a flexible move, keeping ...Rb6 in reserve. If 6 a3 c4, for instance, the manoeuvre ...5)ge7-c8-b6 may be a better way of using the b6-square and if Black has an ...f6 plan in mind (6 a3 f6 or 6 a3 c4 7 $Le2 f6. for example), it may also be quite un- necessary to play ...' b6. If 6 Ji.e2, Black may play 6...Rb6 again but 6,..<?3ge7, in order to put It immediately becomes clear that 3 e5 is not a move aimed at fast development, for it can be said with only a slight amount of exaggeration that Black is now taking the initiative. He at- tacks d4 and has plenty of opportunity to be- come aggressive on the queenside. In fact this is exactly why, from time to time, theory has con- sidered the Advance Variation to be inferior. But the crucial question is: how does Black's short- term initiative compare to White's long-term prospects? This is where theory has changed its mind again and again in the past (and is likely to keep on doing so in the future).

White either has to lose a tempo with 8 Jte2 or 8 aLc2 or gambit a pawn with 8
O-O.
For this reason, 6 Ne2 has become the more usual move, but of course this is in fact a (minor) concession, for the bishop is slightly less ag- gressive on e2. To make this perhaps somewhat abstract argument more concrete: Black might intensify the attack against d4 with 6...cxd4 7 cxd4 Nh6 (or 7...?)ge7), followed by 8...Nf5. now that there is no bishop at d3 to eliminate this knight. But the most popular move and probably the most critical test of 5...Rb6 is 6 a3 (D). This may look rather slow and humble at first sight, but it is in fact the opening move of a very ambitious plan. White is going to chal- lenge Black's domination of the queenside by playing b4, attacking c5, relieving the pressure against b2, creating a new square for the queen's bishop at b2 and gaining back space, all at the same time. All these features become tangible Black relinquishes the pressure against d4 and redirects his attention to the new Achilles' Heel in White's position: the b3-square. Not only is White unable to play 7 b3 cxb3 8 axb3 now that his pawn is no longer on a2 (as he cer- tainly would in case of 6 Be2 c4 for instance), but he is also facing the positional threat of ...S)a5-b3. It is true that by playing 7 Clbd2 White prevents this rather easily but this bottles

up his entire queenside for after 7...?Ba5 the threat of ...I53b3 is permanent and the knight will not be able to leave d2 at will. This all means that a heavy positional struggle lies ahead, not just strategically but tactically as well. White may, for instance, decide to persevere in his plan of challenging Black's domination of the queen- side and venture b4 as a pawn sacrifice. After 8 b4 cxb3 9 Bb2 followed by 10 c4. a sharp tight for the initiative is likely to ensue. And if While simply develops his kingside instead. Black may play ...f6 sooner or later, which is again likely to trigger some very unclear complications. 3 <Nc3 3 21c3 (D) main line of the French until another possibility rose to the fore around 1930: 3...Jlb4, the Wina- wer Variation. This is a highly complex line which, having driven generations of 3 <2k3 play- ers to despair, has now been tamed to some de- gree. but still constitutes the sharpest and most critical reply to 3 4bc3. In the shadow of these main lines there are a few other moves, of which 3...'?3c6 is the most generally accepted. Instead of attacking e4. Black is aiming his guns at d4, but the idea is the same as what motivates 3...Nf6 and 3... jLb4: to force White to make a decision. After 4 Q3f3 <2)f6 5 e5 '$3e4, 6 jLd3 J:.b4 7 ±d2 has devel- oped into the main line here, with the ambitious 6 -41e2 a dangerous runner-up. Rubinstein Variation 3 ... dxe4 This interpretation of the French Defence first became fashionable around 1900. It was a controversial one from the start. Lasker and Rubinstein liked the move and often played it, but Tarrasch for one never had a kind word for it. Then when .3...Nb4 started to become popu- lar, the Rubinstein Variation faded into the background and for almost the rest of the 20th century it was invariably given the epithet 'pas- sive' in the books. The truth is that there was simply no interest in it. Nobody took the trou- ble to re-examine it properly for more than half a century. When this finally did happen in the 1990s, the long rest turned out to have done the Rubinstein a world of good. Below layers of dust lay a lively and resourceful variation, which became one of the most popular defences to 1 e4 almost overnight and which must be held partly responsible for the rise of interest in the Advance Variation.
4 Nxe4 (D)
Having given up his stronghold in the centre, the pawn on d5, Black has chosen a type of middlegame which is very different from ev- erything we have seen so far. White has more space and excellent opportunities for active piece development. Black has a position with- out any weaknesses and the strategic prospect of playing ...c5, eliminating White's remaining pushes the problems back where they belong: on the opponent's doorstep. Instead of deter- mining the central pawn-formation immedi- ately, White simply waits for things to come. In choosing a reply. Black must again care- fully consider the consequences of both e5 and - to a lesser extent - exd5. The obvious solution to this problem is to cut the Gordian Knot at once by playing 3...dxe4. This is the Rubin- stein Variation and it is certainly the simplest of Black's options in this position. The consequences of 3... f6 are rather more difficult to evaluate. White is challenged to play e5 with an attractive gain of tempo (as compared to 3 e5). This is usually called the Classical Variation these days. It was the unchallenged

Wz centre pawn. But first he has to find a way to develop his pieces. 4 ... Nd7 This is the classical method, preparing to continue ...4?gf6 and then recapture with the

idea is to develop the queen's bishop first. The straightforward 4...b6 has never had a good reputation because it allows White to force ...c6 by playing either 5 Rf3 (threatening 6 5)f6+) or 5 %if.3 Bb7 6 .b5+, obstructing the hl-a8 diagonal. But 4...Ji.d7 is thought to be a very re- liable move and this is often played nowadays. A critical position is reached after 5 Nf3 Ji.c6 6 Nd3 'fid? 7 O-O Ngf6. In order to prevent ex- changes on a grand scale. White usually re- treats his knight to g3 or d2. In this variation Black often plays ... .xf3 followed by ...c6 in- stead of the classical ...c5. This promises him a slightly passive (so the old epithet was not com- pletely wrong!) but very solid position.
5 Qf3 ' Ngf6(D)
One major difference from the 4... .d7 vari- ation is that 6 4og3 is now not very strong be- cause this allows Black to play 6...c5 without any problems. This advance of the black c- pawn is the crux of the opening struggle. Will White be able to stop it. and, if the answer is negative, how should he anticipate it? Thanks to the enormous populatin' the Ru- binstein has been enjoying of late, several pos- sibilities have been tested intensively and at the very highest level. White's main trump is fast development, which enables him to go for some aggressive options. What makes this variation so interesting is that Black does not need to fear this aggression. Notwithstanding the many dan- gers that lie in store for him. Black is almost al- ways able to carry out his plan: to play ...c5.
6 Nxf6+
The main alternative is 6 .g5, when a posi- tion arises which is also (and in fact much more often) reached via the related Burn Variation (3...Nf6 4 Jlg5 dxe4; see page 357). It is some- times said that the idea of the Burn Variation is to wait for White to play Jtg5 before taking on e4 and that this slight difference favours Black, but this is far from certain. The big difference between 6 'S)xf6+ and 6 Jlg5 is that after 6 Ag5 Black renews the prob- lem by playing 6...Jle7 and that now 7 Nxf6+ can be met by 7,.. .xf6. when after 8 Axf6 Qxf6 Black not only has the prospect of play- ing ...c5 but of ...e5 as well. It is very difficult for White to capitalize on his spatial advantage in this line. Attempts to improve on this are 8 Qd2 and 8 h4 on the white side and 6...h6 7 Ah4 Ae7 (instead of the immediate 6...Ji.e7) by Black.
6 ... (D)
Again White has to make a decision: should he play the temptingly active 7 Jtg5 or does this move only provoke a further exchange of pieces? And again this is aposition of equal im- portance for the Bum and the Rubinstein Varia- tion. After 7...c5 the situation is critical. White has tried a variety of moves, of which 8 Jlb5+ is the most direct. After 8...i.d7 9 Bxd7+ Qxd7, practice has shown that Black does not have to worry about getting his f-pawns doubled by 10
FRENCH DEFENCE 355
jLxf6 gxf6. 10 Qe2, intending to castle queen- side. is an option. Since it is unclear who actually benefits from the pin Js,g5, other moves are at least equally critical, especially for the move-order of the Rubinstein Variation (it is only after 7 Jlg5 that the roads of the Burn and the Rubinstein inter- sect).
7 Jld3 is White's most popular move. He al-
lows Black to play 7,..c5 and after 8 dxc5 .xc5 he has a choice between castling kingside (when play might continue 9 O-O O-O 10 Bg5 b6 11 Re2 iLb7 12 Hadi) and castling queenside (starting with 9 Re2 O-O 10 >i.g5 or 10 jLd2). The alternative 7 c3 c5 8 *Se5, preparing 9 jLb5+, also has to be taken into account. Al- most a century ago, Capablanca even played 7 ?)e5 immediately. Classical Variation
3 ... (D)
Before the rise of the Winawer Variation, this was by far the most important line of the French. So normal was it to play 3...Nf6 in this position that it did not even occur to anyone to 'claim' the move and give it a name, except that it was sometimes called the 'normal' defence. But dur- ing the heyday of the Winawer, 3...?)f6 fell into disuse until it was rediscovered in the 1980s. Nowadays 3...Nf6 and 3..jLb4 are thought to be of equal importance and the old 'normal de- fence' has been named the Classical Variation. The most obvious reply to 3...Nf6 is 4 e5, the Steinitz Variation. It is this line in particular that has profited from the recent wave of atten- tion S.-.'&fb has been receiving. Theory of this line has become immensely more detailed and complex. Yet 4 Bg5, by far the most usual move in the first half of the 20th century, remains an impor- tant option. This is the starting point of three old, but highly topical variations. The same cannot be said about 4 exdS. Once it was thought that the inclusion of GbcZ and ...<?2f6 (as compared to the Exchange Variation, 3 exd5 ) would favour White, but this has turned out to be overoptimistic. After 4...exd5 5 Jig5 Jle7 6 Jid3 -5)c6 Black has no problems to speak of. Steinitz Variation
4 e5 Nfd7 (D)
This is to all practical purposes the starting point of the Steinitz Variation, although the rather speculative 4...Ne4 5 Nxe4 dxe4 (in- tending 6...c5) is also played occasionally. A superficial comparison of the position after
4...Rd7 with the Advance Variation would sug-
gest that Black has not at all done well. He has made two moves with his king's knight as a re- sult of which this piece is now standing on what must look like an unfortunate square: d7. But if we take a closer look, things turn out to be not so simple. In fact there is a striking parallel with the Classical Variation of the King's Indian Defence

likely to produce a heavy battle, for Black can be expected to strike back with all his might. There is, for instance, the move 7...b5, gaining space on the queenside, or there is 7...'Q'b6 to put maximum pressure on both d4 and b2. In some cases Black plays ...g5, while ...f6 and ...fxe5 to create counterplay along the f-file is also a likely option.

White strengthens e5 and continues to develop his pieces in a harmonious way. 5 ... c5 6 <53f3 £tc6 ready to pounce on e4 with ...f5 in the King's In- 7 dke3 (D) dian). when c5 and b6 are likely to become ex- cellent squares for the d7-knight and White's e5-pawn may come under attack. Besides. c3 is not necessarily a very good square for White's knight, for it obstructs the characteristic c3. 5 f4 White firmly protects e5 and makes it clear where his future lies: on the kingside. In the long run the advance f5 will become an option. Just how very different a mind-set is re- quired in closed positions as compared to the open type of position usually resulting from 1 e4 e5 openings is nicely illustrated by two alter- natives: 5 €Bf3 and 5 ?)ce2.
5 W3 may look like a perfectly natural and
healthy developing move, but the strategic downside of it is that after 5...c5 followed by
6...Nc6, White's e5-pawn becomes vulnerable.
If White adapts his play to this potential danger, there is certainly no cause for alarm: by playing 6 dxc5 Nc6 7 Bf4 he keeps everything well un- der control. But in this case Black will eliminate White's remaining centre pawn with 7... .xc5 8 Bd3 1'6, when 9 exf6 4)xf6 10 O-O O-O leads to a position where most of the tension has been re- solved. In striking contrast to 5 4)f3, 5 '7\ce2 looks ugly and unnatural, but strategically this is a much more ambitious move (which is not to say that it is necessarily better!). White frees the way for his c-pawn so as to answer 5...c5 with 6 c3. thus preserving his stronghold at d4. After
6...N06 he will continue 7 f4, keeping his entire
central pawn-formation intact. This variation is Starting from this position, some widely dif- fering variations have been developed over the past two or three decades. For many years, 7...#b6 was regarded as the critical test of White's set-up. Black is attack- ing b2 and preparing 8...cxd4 9 $3xd4 Jkc5 at the same time. This sharp move has to be judged on the merits of 8 Na4 Ra5+ 9 c3 and more in particular on the consequences of the piece sac- rifice 9...cxd4 10 b4 Nxb41? 11 cxb4 .xb4+ 12 Bd2 Bxd2+ 13 Nxd2. At first Black's chances in this position, where he has three pawns for the piece and White's two knights are far from ideally placed, were viewed rather optimisti- cally. But once theory began to dig deeper and deeper with more of the world's very best play- ers taking an interest, enthusiasm for Black's prospects cooled off. even though a clear refu- tation has never been found.
FRENCH DEFENCE 357
8...cxd4 9 xd4 Ac5, which is likely to trans-
pose to the above line after 10 O-O-O O-O, but he can also play 8...b5 at once. White's attack- ing chances on the kingside catch the eye, but Black's territorial gains on the queenside are equally impressive. This is a variation that can only lead to a very fierce battle. A variation on this theme is to play 7...cxd4 8 'Six <14 and only then 8...Rb6 (D). 4 g5 Now 9 Na4 ' a5+ 10 c3 Nxd4 is of little use to White since 1 1 Jlxd4? b5 drops a piece while the zwischenzug 1 1 b4 can be met by 11... .xb4 12 cxb4 Qxb4+ 13 Nd2 Qe7. The pawn sacri- fice 9 Bd2 Qxb2 10 *bl Qa3. and now, for in- stance. 1 1 JsLb5. is a critical line. While Black's position is both solid and resilient. White's lead in development is undeniably huge. This is an ideal variation for those who love to analyse their openings deeply and accurately at home. A more common interpretation of this line is to follow 7...cxd4 8 <2)xd4 up with 8..Bc5. While preparing ...Rb6, Black does not com- mit himself to this sharp move. Yet after the natural reply 9 Rd2 Black has to lay his cards on the table. One option is to go for a mass- exchange of pieces with 9... ,xd4 10 jlxd4 Nxd4 11 Rxd4 Rb6 12 Qxb6 Nxb6 and hope that Black's fortress will be strong enough to withstand the long siege that is to be expected. This is in fact playing for a draw rather bla- tantly and the name Vacuum Cleaner Varia- tion is highly appropriate. The alternative is to initiate a sharp battle by simply castling into White's natural attacking zone, the kingside (9...O-O), and start looking for counterplay on the other side of the board. A characteristic and hotly debated sample variation is 10 O-O-O a6
11 h4 Nxd4 12 _txd4 b5 13 Sh3 b4 14 4Ba4
Jlxd4 15 Rxd4 and now, for instance. 15...f6!?. The immediate 7,..a6 is also played quite often. After 8 W2 Black then not only has A move in the spirit of 3 5)c3. In once more delaying the choice between e5 and exd5. White is again hoping to improve the circum- stances for either of these moves. Now it is up to Black to choose between three wildly differ- ent variations, two of them rather obvious, but the third one not at all. The obvious ones are
4...dxe4, the Burn Variation, and the calm de-
veloping move 4,..i,e7. The third is 4...jLb4, the notorious McCutcheon Variation. Burn Variation 4 ... dxe4 As I mentioned in the section on the Rubin- stein Variation (see page 353), this line is loosely based on the idea that taking on e4 is more ac- curate if While has already committed himself to lLg5. But whether this is indeed so is quite unclear. In fact, many players who like this type of position have both the Rubinstein and the Burn Variation in their opening repertoire now- adays!
358 FUNDAMENTAL CHESS OPENINGS
5 <5}xe4 If 5 Axf6. an interesting aspect of this type of position is highlighted, which plays a more prominent role in the Burn than in the Rubin- stein Variation, Instead of accepting the loss of time incurred by 5...Rxf6 6 Nxe4 Qd8, Black can very well play 5...gxf6, seeking to lake the initiative immediately with 6 Nxe4 f5 7 Ng3 Ji.g7 8 5)f3 c5. The motif of recapturing on f6 with the g-pawn becomes more logical and powerful if White takes on f6 with the bishop, thus giving up the bishop-pair. 5 ... ,Bc7 (D) This is the classical Bum move. 5...Nbd7 is a subtle alternative, which after 6 <2Bf3 I have classified (rather randomly I must admit) as pan of the Rubinstein Variation (see page 354). to do the recapturing. If 6...Axf6 White has consolidated the dominant position of his e4- knight. This will make it possible to prepare calmly for an attack on the kingside. 7 '?\f3 O-O
8 W2 <£jd7 9 O-O-O &.e7 10 Nd3 b6 1 1 h4 (or
11 egS) is a characteristic sample variation. Black has to be very careful here. By playing 6...gxf6 (D) instead, Black intro- duces another dynamic factor. With his doubled f-pawns, he increases his control over the cen- tral squares, but of course he does create a few holes in his pawn-structure. This is the most difficult and the most controversial of the many ...gxf6 options that Black has in this variation. After the usual reply 7 4Nf3. White is better armed against 7...f5 than he is in the 5 Axf6 gxf6 line because after 8 <Nc3 .sLf6 Black has needed an extra move to put his king's bishop on the long diagonal. Nevertheless, this is an in- teresting option for Black and one which is played quite frequently. The alternative 7...b6 is more cautious and is likely to lead to a heavy strategic battle. A typi- cal (although by no means forced) continuation is 8 Nc4 kb7 9 Re2 c6 10 O-O-O Nd7 1 1 sfcbl Rc7 1 2 3hel O-O-O. Now 13 Ba6 forces a use- ful exchange of bishops because the b7-bishop is an important defender of Black's king in this type of position. In many cases, Black will try to play ...f5 and ...Bf6 after all to activate his other bishop, but this plan has the drawback of making the e5-square accessible to White's knights. Another crucial element of the strate- gic make-up of the position is the advance d5. White faces the same problem as in the Ru- binstein Variation after 3...dxe4 4 *2}xe4 <5M7 5 <2)f3 Ngf6 6 Jlg5 Jcc7 (see page 354): what should he do with the e4-knight? As is so often the case, a minimal difference between two lines (the extra moves Qlf3 and ...i$abd7) causes the variations to be markedly different in char- acter. To begin with - and this is hardly sensational - 6 S)xf6+ is unlikely to gain in strength now that Black can reply 6...Jlxf6 7 i.xf6 Qxf6 8 4Y.3 O-O and is probably able to find something better than ...Nd7 on his next move.

Natural as this move may be, it is not self- evident. However lazy or dull individual chess- players may be sometimes, opening theory as a whole certainly isn't and so in this position a double-edged pawn sacrifice has grown into a fully-fledged and popular alternative: 6 h4, the Chatard-Alekhine Attack. White is out for more than just a positionally correct exchange of bishops; he wants an open h-file as well. Just how powerful White's attack really is after
6...Jlxg5 7 hxg5 Rxg5, and now 8 *2)h3 Qe7 9
*2)f4. for instance, is not at all clear but in tour- nament practice most players prefer to decline the pawn sacrifice and go for solid moves like
6...c5 or 6...a6. After 6...c5 7 Jcxe7 Black (prob-
ably) has to recapture with the king because
7...''Q,xe7 runs into 8 2)b5, but in a closed posi-
tion like this it is not really a problem. 6...a6 is designed to eliminate this little quirk and can therefore be said to be more cautious. 6 ... 'Vlxel (D) In the long run White may try to force this cen- tral break with the help of c4. Recently 7...a6 has also become popular. This is a bold and provocative variation on the theme of 7...b6. Apparently unafraid of giving the opponent more targets. Black wants to play
8...b5 and 9...Bb7, gaining space on the queen-
side.
4...±e7
4 ... Ne7 (D) This is the classical reply to White's fourth move. White now finally has to decide what to do with his e-pawn unless he is prepared to give up his bishop-pair and play 5 Axf6. This is un- likely to worry players with a natural prefer- ence for knights over bishops and in fact this very old variation (a favourite of the great Adolf Anderssen in the middle of the 19th century) is surprisingly similar to the hypermodern Trom- powsky Attack (see page 1 71) but it is not pop- ular at all. 5 e5 Just as on move four, taking on d5 is com- pletely innocuous. After 5 exd5. 5,..exd5 leads to a position that was discussed under 4 exd5 and Black also has 5...4Bxd5 6 .xc7 Rxe7. solving his opening problems rather easily. 5 ... S)fd7
5...?)e4 is an even more speculative sortie
than was 4 e5 *2)e4 in the Steinitz Variation (see page 355). Nevertheless it is occasionally played, mainly as a surprise weapon. After 6 Until far into the 20th century, books on the French Defence tended to devote a large quan- tity of their pages to this position. It was called
360 FUNDAMENTAL CHESS OPENINGS
the basic position of the Classical Variation and every even remotely plausible move by White was treated as an independent variation and - in many books - given a name. But when 3...Jlb4 expelled the classical 3...€lf6 from its domi- nant position, much of this ancient theory be- gan gathering dust. Nobody was interested any more. With the rehabilitation of the Classical French, the diagrammed position has resumed some of its former importance. It should be compared critically to the basic position of the Steinitz Variation (see page 356). A dogmatic compari- son would suggest that the exchange of bishops must be to White's advantage, simply because it is his 'bad' bishop against Black's 'good' one that goes ('bad' meaning that the bishop is ham- pered in its activity by his own centre pawns fixed on squares of the same colour, and 'good' the opposite). In fact, this is what motivates many players to prefer 4 Bg5 to 4 e5. They as- sume that they have now reached a favourable version of the Steinitz Variation. But this as- sessment is very complicated. There are other factors to be taken into account than just the colour of your bishop. Because of the exchange, Black's position - always a little cramped in the French - becomes freer and with the disappear- ance of White's dark-squared bishop a poten- tially dangerous threat to Black's kingside is eliminated. The most important move by far in modern theory, just like in the Steinitz, is 7 f4. A char- acteristic continuation would be 7...O-O 8 5)f3 c5 9 Qd2 Nc6 10 dxc5 f6. Due to his greater freedom of movement (thanks to the exchange of bishops!), Black is in a position to break down White s entire pawn-centre. The down- side to this plan is that it is precisely in the type of position resulting from these pawn ex- changes, after 11 exf6 Rxf6 12 g3 Nxc5 for instance, that the absence of a dark-squared bishop is making itself felt the most, for White now has two potentially strong squares for his pieces at d4 and e5. But it remains to Black's credit that he enjoys relatively great freedom for his pieces. The light-squared bishop, for instance, often gets manoeuvred to g6 or h5 via d7 and e8. McCutcheon Variation 4 ... Nb4 (D) 'Attack is the best form of defence' might be the motto of this variation. Black is trying to in- vert the dynamics of the position. Instead of civilly defending against the threat of e5, he makes an attempt to bend the consequences of that advance to his own advantage. The McCutcheon Variation was very popu- lar from about 1905 until 1925 even at the high- est level. It then withdrew from the public eye and became a sort of ghost, appearing from time to time - always unexpectedly - to scare the living daylights out of an unsuspecting op- ponent and then disappear again. Any hope of finding comfort and solace in the books was al- ways frustrated, for these had got stuck in the theoretical situation of 1925 and could offer lit- tle or no help to newer generations. It was not until about 1990 that this situa- tion finally began to change. More and more players started using the McCutcheon not just as a hit-and-run tactic but as a regular part of their opening repertoire. Inevitably, theory had to crawl out of the shadows where it had been hiding and much to everyone's surprise the McCutcheon appeared to tolerate the light of day very well. All variations that had ap- peared so elusive and phantom-like were nicely charted but not refuted. The strategic features were clarified yet without resolving the mys- tery and the inherent tension of the whole line. As a result, the McCutcheon now enjoys a
FRENCH DEFENCE 361
looks better than it actually is. After 7...Sg8 and now, for instance, 8 h4 gxh4 9 Rh5 Rf6, Black will collect the pawn at g7 and obtain a solid position. 6 jie3 is the sharpest move. White allows his opponent to play 6...<2Be4, but avoids an ex- change of his queen's bishop (as will be the case after 6 Jld2). The critical continuation is 7 Qg4 4'f8 (or 7...g6) 8 a3. After 8...i.xc3+ 9 bxc3 Black can win a pawn at c3 either at once or after the preliminary (and highly thematic)
9...C5.
It is striking how difficult it is to evaluate the position in all of these variations. The McCutcheon almost always produces these murky, complicated middlegames where both sides are likely to persevere in their course of action but always run the risk of totally under- estimating the opponent's chances. 6 ... Jlxc3 (N) Naturally 6...£je4?? is now impossible due to 7 '$3xe4. healthy theoretical status, is widely popular, has retained something of its former mysteri- ous aura and it remains controversial. 5 e5 The exchange 5 exd5 offers slightly better chances than it did a move earlier. Many players even avoid the symmetrical recapture 5...exd5 (±ough this is certainly playable) and prefer the more aggressive 5,..Qxd5. The theoretical ques- tion then is whether after 6 Axf6 Black should just play 6...gxf6 (permitting White to 'rescue' his pawn-formation with 7 <?3e2) or if he should insen 6... .xc3+. Similar problems are raised if White plays 5 dLd3. A plausible continuation would be to play
5...dxe4 6 jLxe4 <2)bd7 intending 7...h6 and (if
necessary) 8...<2>xf6. The position after 6 Jlxe4 also arises via the Winawer Variation (see page 363). It is one of only a very small number of actual links between these two variations which on the surface look so very alike. 5 ... h6 (D) Breaking the pin against the knight and avoid- ing the loss of a piece. White now faces a cru- cial decision. 6 i.d2 This continuation has been the main line for decades. Sustaining the pin with 6 Jl.h4 is of little use for after 6...g5 7 jLg3 4he4 Black is already tak- ing over the initiative. The rather meek 6 jLxf6 gxf6 also holds little promise for White. But 6 exf6 is a serious alternative, even though White's position after 6...hxg5 7 fxg7 7 bxc3 This may look an odd follow-up to White's previous move. Why not play 7 Jtxc3, keeping the pawn-structure intact? The answer is that this plan does not really work because after
7...<£je4 the consistent 8 Bb4 runs into the
treacherous 8...c5 9 dxc5 4bxf2! 10 Rxf2 Rh4+. Another argument against 7 .xc3 is that by taking the bishop off the cl -h6 diagonal. White releases the pressure against Black's kingside. If he plays 8 Rg4, for instance. Black can now simply castle or play 8...Qg5.

In spite of these objections. 7 Bxc3 is occa- sionally played but it is definitely not the main line. 7 ... e4 So far everything is running smoothly for Black. His e4-knight is well-placed and after a 'normal' move like 8 Jld3, he has a very natural way of starting an attack on the queenside in
8...Nxd2 9 Qxd2 c5, which will compensate
him for White's space advantage on the king- side. If we compare this to the Winawer Varia- tion (of which this position is reminiscent) Black has a comparatively easy game.

the kingside, for instance with h5 followed by 2h3-g3. Just to illustrate how subtle and far- reaching even the slightest decision in this line can be: it could be an improvement for White to play 11 h4 straightaway, preserving the option of playing 4t3e2/h3-f4 instead of
9 J"d3
White is prepared to move his king to d2, a courageous decision. In fact, even after 9 c5 10 Jcd3 RJxd2 recapturing with the king is standard. It is undeniable that White's king is vulnerable in the middle of the board, but the fact that his knight and rooks will be able to move freely proves ample compensation. 9 ... Nxd2
10 Qxd2 c5 (D)
However, this aggressive move shows up a drawback of Black's opening play. Unlike after 7 jLxc3. Black has no easy way of protecting g7 for 8...0-07? fails to 9 JLxhb. He will have to make a concession. 8 ... g6 This has been the most popular choice, but
8...ti?f8 also has its supporters. Which of these
moves is better is truly difficult to say. By play- ing 8...Nf8. Black gives priority to the solidity of his pawn-structure. If 8...g6. it is the greater mobility of his pieces that he is interested in. A sample continuation after 8...Qf8: 9 Ad3 ?Jxd2

1 1 Qxg5 hxg5 is not as good as it looks, for White can quickly seize the initiative on the kingside with 12 Sfl or even 12 f4 gxf4 13 Sfl) and after 11 ?)f3 4Bc6 12 h4 Black can start an attack on the queenside with 12.,.c4 followed by ...b5-b4. White will have to counterattack on This is one of the most critical positions of the McCutcheon Variation. A battle on two fronts is in the offing. White will attack on the kingside and Black on the queenside. For White, an h4-h5 plan seems indicated, while the queen manoeuvre Rf4-f6 may also be useful and in some cases even a piece sacrifice on g6 (Jlxg6) is a possibility. Black has all sorts of options on the queenside, mainly based on ...cxd4 at some point. The slower plan of playing ...c4 is usu- ally combined with 8... ?f8 because this move gives White less of a target on the kingside so Black does not have to hurry his own plans.
11 h4 is a characteristic continuation. Black
then has the straightforward 1l...Nc6 in order to meet 12 Rf4 with 12...cxd4 13 cxd4 Ra5+ 14 c3 (or 14 Qe3) and now 14...b6 followed by ...Aa6 or 14...b5 intending ...b4. Another possibility is

Although 3...jLb4 was a well-known variation as far back as the 19th century and is usually at- tributed to Simon Winawer, who played it in 1867 against Steinitz, it was Aron Nimzowitsch (1886-1935) who turned the move into a coher- ent and meaningful opening system and in many countries it bears his name rather than Wina- wer's. As is the case with 3...£rf6. Black is attacking e4, but he avoids both the pin Bg5 and the loss of time involved in 3.,.<£jf6 4 e5 ifd7. Those arc important pluses. Are there any minuses? In the days of Steinitz and Winawer, the an- swer to this question was sought in the sym- metrical pawn-structure resulting from 4 exd5 exd5. The essence of their reasoning was that the bishop is no longer useful at b4 and that an exchange on c3 is no longer appealing. Nimzo- witsch's great merit in this matter is to have demonstrated that this judgement is incorrect, or at least far too categorical. After 5 Ad3 c6 6 "2)e2 Qge7 7 O-O Nf5, for instance, Black has nothing to complain about. This change of judgement suddenly left White with a serious problem. For if 4 exd5 holds no promise, what is he to play? A coun- terattack against g7 looks plausible but it is pretty clear that the blunt 4 Qg4 is rather dou- ble-edged at best if Black boldly replies 4...Nf6
5 Rxg7 3g8. Later the consequences of 4 Rg4
were analysed in greater detail, together with the related lines 4 a3 iLxc3+ 5 bxc3 dxe4 6 Rg4 and
4 Ji.d2 dxe4 5 Rg4. These variations have ob-
tained their place in the books, but although these are interesting attempts they have never managed to pose a serious threat to 3...Jlb4.
4 Ji.d3 and 4 £te2 produce a much quieter
type of game, but neither of these moves pre- tends to be a refutation of 3...3Lb4. They just try to avoid things getting out of hand.
4 Ji-d3 leads, after 4...dxe4 5 jLxe4 $3f6 6
Jig5, to a position that also arises from the McCutcheon (see page 361) and is obviously related to the Rubinstein Variation. 4 5)e2 produces the same type of position after 4...dxc4 5 a3 if play now continues 5...Ae7 6 5)xe4. Hanging on to the extra pawn with
5...Axc3+ 6 5)xc3 f5 is a possibility but this
undoubtedly gives up the initiative (White first to provide some cover for the kingside, most notably the f6-square, by playing 1 l...Xd7 and meeting 12 Rf4 by 12...Jtc6 13 2)f3 '<)d7. In this case White may switch plans and play 1 2 h5 g5 13 1'4, opening some files on the kingside as quickly as possible. Winawer Variation 3 ... Ab4 (D) To a great many players, this move is the jewel in the crown of the French Defence. In a manner very similar to the Nimzo-Indian De- fence, Black proposes to exchange bishop for knight and in so doing raises the uneasy question of how to evaluate the accompanying distur- bance of White's pawn-structure. This intro- duces an element of tension and makes for a highly delicate positional equilibrium. As a re- sult there will be chances for both sides, rather than White simply trying to create, and Black trying to neutralize, a small opening advantage. It should not therefore come as a surprise that the Winawer has always been a variation for the real fighters, for those who are not inter- ested in stability but in dynamics. It is also an opening for the optimists, who are more inter- ested in their own chances than in those of their opponents. And finally it is an opening for the courageous, for i t is a matter not of ignoring the opponent's chances and hoping for the best, but of not being afraid of them. The similarity with the Nimzo-Indian is not a coincidence for they share the same originator.

profound plan, that may be introduced by 4...b6 and 4...Qd7 alike and that has remained a ma- jor alternative to 4...c5 ever since. Black aims to play ...jLa6 with the idea of exchanging his queen's bishop, always a prob- lem child in the French Defence (and some- times ironically nicknamed the French bishop), for White's king's bishop, a radical and a very sound solution to this problem. The drawback of this approach is that White is given a free hand, but since this variation is far from easy to play this may turn out (in practice) to be actu- ally a disadvantage! Many a game with this line has seen White not knowing what to do with his freedom and just getting himself in trouble. An important issue in this type of position is what both players think of the exchange on c3. If Black plays 4...b6, he has to be aware of the fact that the reply 5 Rg4 will force him to take back his third move and play 5...Jtf8 (unless he is prepared to make a major positional conces- sion with 5...s4?f8 or 5...g6). Fortunately, because of the extremely slow nature of the position. Black can afford this loss of time. Even after the more neutral 5 a3, there are those who play
5...3tf8 anyway, instead of the much more nat-
ural 5...jLxc3+. There are also quite a number of players who prefer 4...Qd7. This move may look rather weird at first sight, but the idea is to meet 5 Qg4 with
5...f5, which is perfectly sound, although it is not
at all certain whether after 6 Qg3 the change of pawn-structure benefits Black in the long run (for he can no longer attack White's central for- mation with ...f6). Then there are those who wish to avoid a doubling of pawns (or at least do not wish to en- courage it unduly). These players usually pre- fer 5 Jtd2 against either 4...b6 or 4...Rd7. The main long-term plan is to move the knight from c3 and go for b3 and c4, taking the initiative on the queenside, thus 'punishing' Black for not doing so himself (by playing ...c5). Both 4,..b6 and 4...Qd7 require a good posi- tional understanding of the situation rather than a knowledge of variations. In fact, there practi- cally aren't any! A few examples of how the game might develop: a) 4...b6 and now: might continue 7 f3) and is seen as rather risky. A more cautious way of making 5...jLxc3+ playable is just to forget about 6...f5 and play
6...<£jc6 instead.
All of these possibilities have grown into fully-fledged variations over the years, but there is only one move that is seen, by friend and foe alike, as the critical test of 3...Bb4:
4 e5 (D)
After Nimzowitsch's defusing of the old 4 exd5. it was thought for some time that 3...Bb4 is actually an extremely solid defence to 3 <21c3 for even if 4 exd5 was not a great move, there simply did not seem to be anything better. Even as late as 1941, the authoritative Theory of Chess Openings by Max Euwe judged ''main- taining the tension in the centre to be best for White" only to admit immediately that a con- vincing way of doing so is sadly lacking. Advancing the e-pawn to e5 was of course not an unknown idea but it was seen as too slow since after 4...c5 Black is virtually a move ahead on the comparable situation in the Clas- sical Variation (3...<2hf6 4 e5 ?}fd7). The impli- cations of the critical 5 a3 were also seen in a negative light. However, after many years of uncertainty it finally turned out that precisely here, in the most distrusted pan of the 3..Bb4 complex, the key lay hidden: the only way to put 3...Bb4 truly and fundamentally to the test. 4 ... c5 A principled reply but not the only one.

al) 5 Rg4 Bf8 6 Bg5 'si'd7 and now 7 f4 ±a6 or 7 Jlb5 c6 8 Ji.a4. The latter variation has the drawback of leaving the bishop stranded on a4 but it does avoid exchanging it for Black's queen's bishop. a2) 5 a3 Jlxc3+ 6 bxc3 Qd7 (this position can also be reached via 4...Qd7 5 a3 A.xc3+ 6 bxc3 b6) 7 Q'g4 f5 8 Rg3 Na6 9 Axa6 <21xa6 10Ne2 O-O-O with chances for both sides. Black has the satisfying prospect of moving his knight to c4 (,..Nb8-c6-a5-c4), while White may ei- ther try to break open the queenside with a4-a5 and c4 (the violent option) or increase the pres- sure on the kingside with moves like h4-h5-h6 or g4 (the patient option). b) 4...W7 5 i.d2 b6 6 2>f3 Na6 7 Nxa6 Nxa6 8 Qe2 Nb8 9 O-O 2)e7 10 Ndl Nxd2 1 1 Rxd2 O-O 12 Ne3. The same plan may be introduced by 4...Ne7, when after 5 a3 Bxc3+ 6 bxc3 Black can trans- pose to the main line with 6...c5 but he also has
6...b6. Here too 7 Rg4 is the critical reply.
Black can defend g7 by simply playing 7...O-O but after 8 .g5 his king is not safe. The most important starting position of this line arises af- ter 7...<2)g6 8 h4 h5. We now return to 4...c5 (D): White invests a whole tempo in persuading Black to make an exchange of pieces whose consequences are as yet totally unclear. Who benefits? This is indeed a decision that can only be made if you are absolutely sure of what you are doing or ... if theory presents it as being self-evident. In fact, by playing 5 a3 White crosses the last border that still separated him from what is now thought of as the heart of the Winawer Varia- tion. This type of position is difficult to play and almost impossible to understand. Other moves are less committal, simpler, most certainly playable, but far less threatening to Black. Even 5 :ffg4, which is an aggressive move, is not really dangerous for Black since after
5...2>e7 the straightforward 6 Rxg7 fig8 7
'S'xh7 is dubious due to 7...cxd4 8 a3 Ra5. when White is forced to seek refuge in the murky exchange sacrifice 9 axb4 Qxal 10 £tee2. A more reliable move is 6 dxc5, but this makes the position of White's queen on g4 rather questionable. 5 dxc5 immediately or 5 Nf3 Ne7 6 dxc5 is also sometimes played, but if White is really looking for a solid option, he usually goes for 5 Ad2. The point of this move is that 5...cxd4?! is dubious due to 6 <21b5, when after 6...aLxd2+ 7 xd2 White gets his pawn back without any trouble and the threat of 4Bd6+ will force Black to give up castling. But by simply playing
5...£te7, Black takes most of the sting out of
this set-up. We now return to 5 a3 (D): Modern opening books hardly comment on this move. At the very most it is said to be 'the most principled reply' or something to that ef- fect. And yet there have been times when it was called 'old-fashioned', 'inadvisable' or 'of du- bious value'!
366 FUNDAMENTAL CHESS OPENINGS
5 ... Jlxc3+ Both this and 5...cxd4 were regarded as fa- vourable for Black as 'recently' as the 1930s. But in the course of that decade it slowly began to dawn on the chess world that if White intends to achieve something against the Winawer he has to play these positions and - more impor- tantly perhaps - that this is not quite so impos- sible as used to be thought. The first victim of this budding new insight was the variation
5...cxd4. This used to be judged primarily on
the merits of 6 axb4 dxc3 7 bxc3 ' c7, but when it transpired that White can easily afford a pawn sacrifice and play 7 or 7 #g4, enthusiasm for this approach quickly disappeared. A third option for Black is to retreat the bishop: S...Jla5. Ironically, this move was re- garded with great scepticism in the early days, after Alekhine had shown in 1924 that White gets excellent attacking chances with the pawn sacrifice 6 b4 cxb4 7 *2 b5!. But the variation came to life when it was discovered that Black should play the positionally much more consis- tent 6...cxd4! instead of the greedy 6...cxb4. This leads to the same ultra sharp type of posi- tion that we are about to see in the 5...Axc3+ variation if play continues 7 Qg4 e7 8 bxa5 dxc3 9 Qxg7 Zg8 10 "xh7 (DJ. parts of both White's and Black's position de- stroyed, it is almost impossible to judge who has the better chances, or, to put it more accu- rately, theory changes its mind about this all the time. White will try to round up the c3-pawn and his h-pawn is a powerful long-term trump card. But his Achilles' Heel is the insecure position of his king, which Black will try to attack with op- erations like ...d4, ...$Jf5, ...?)ce7 and ...Jkc6. If 7 bS (instead of 7 Rg4) a somewhat quieter game is likely to result, although even here the position is hard io judge. A critical position arises after 7...jLc7 8 f4. White will regain his pawn quite easily', but Black can try to take advantage of his opponent's somewhat airy queensidc pawn-formation with a move like 8...a5. 6 bxc3 (D) i.imm
2- M
Thanks to the pawn that has appeared on c3, White has got his d-pawn firmly covered, just like in the Advance Variation (3 e5 c5 4 c3). But there are two major differences. First, there is the exchange of knight for bishop. This has left Black vulnerable on the dark squares, but what does this really mean? We have already seen that White has the option of attacking g7. but we have also noticed that this is not always dangerous for Black. It is also clear that White's dark-squared bishop might become very powerful, for instance if it is put on the a3-f8 diagonal with a4 and Ba3, but it is equally clear that it might become totally para- lysed if this plan does not work and the bishop gets hemmed in by its own pawns. After 10... bc6 1 1 f4Qxa5 12 -Nf3 Ad7 13 2bl O-O-O 14 ' d3, for instance, any aggres- sive. tactically oriented player (regardless of the colour he is playing) will probably get the feeling that this must be paradise. With hardly any positional footing for either side and major
FRENCH DEFENCE 367
Secondly, there are the doubled pawns. They make White's position rather static and vulner- able, for Black may attempt to attack both c- pawns and White's a-pawn. But in the meantime White will have a very useful open file on the queenside so that he does not necessarily have to remain passive on that wing. If Black castles queenside, for instance, as he often does in this line, advancing White's a-pawn or doubling rooks on the b-file may become quite dangerous. So who benefits from these two positional factors is impossible to say. The real question is: who will use them the more skilfully? This is precisely what makes the Winawer such an ex- citing variation. The first assessments of this position, dating from the 1920s, were not exactly friendly to White, but they were also decidedly one-di- mensional. It was thought that Black has good prospects on the queenside if he follows a plan based on ...c4, to be played either immediately or after the preliminary moves 6...Ne7 7 W'3 Nbc6 8 Ae2 Qa5 9 Jld2. When it slowly be- came clear that in the meantime White's pros- pects on the opposite wing are at least as good, this assessment was modified. It became clear that Black does well to be flexible: he can play ...c4 if the circumstances are right, but in many cases ...cxd4 with the idea of using the c-file as a base for attack is more promising, and a coun- terattack on the kingside with ...f6 is also an idea to be kept in mind. Thus the whole varia- tion gradually changed into an extremely com- plicated opening system, making high demands on both players. By the end of the 1980s, the Winawer was again transformed when the uncompromising 7 Qg4 began to be analysed with ever-greater precision and relentless tenacity. The image of the Winawer shifted as the somewhat noncom- mittal general considerations such as I just mentioned were brushed aside and replaced by highly concrete ways of coping with White's queen sortie. From this crisis, the cold-blooded reply 7...O-O has emerged as an essentially new interpretation of this line. 6 ... Ne7 There is hardly a trace of the old move 6...c4 left in modern Winawer theory. The positional drawbacks of this move leap to the (modern) eye: not only does 7 Qg4 force Black to make a major concession with 7...g6 or 7...WfS (which is unnecessary after 6...4Bc7) but with Black opening the a3-f8 diagonal so soon, the plan to play a4 followed by Ba3 becomes very attrac- tive indeed. Nevertheless this ancient idea has not been completely abandoned; it has merely been re- fined. The modem and more subtle version of
6...c4 is to play 6...Ra5 7 Ad2 Ra4, blocking
White's a-pawn first and preparing to close the queenside with 8...c4 (after 8 Wbl for instance). Another major option is to play 6...Qc7, with the idea of meeting 7 Qg4 with 7...f5. The question then is whether this change in pawn- formation favours Black or White after 8 ' g3 cxd4 9 cxd4 S)e7 10 Nd2 O-O 1 1 _ld3 for in- stance. The immediate 7...cxd4? does not work because after 8 Rxg7! Rxc3+ 9 *dl Wxal 10 Q'xh8 'iT8 1 1 Bd3 Black's king is in far greater danger than White's. We now return to 6...Q>e7 (D):
7 Rg4
This aggressive approach has driven Black to despair at several moments in the life of the Winawer. Mikhail Botvinnik, one of its greatest champions ever, even gave up on 6... e7 after a disastrous loss to C.H.O'D.Alexander in 1946. When he lost two games with 6...Rc7 as well, both to Mikhail Tai in 1960 and 1961, things were looking very black for the Winawer. But the variation recovered from both of these blows and 7 Qg4 even seemed to fade away shortly
368 FUNDAMENTAL CHESS OPENINGS
afterwards, possibly on the general grounds of just being too complicated and unsafe for most people. After all, sharp attacking variations are all very well to look at, but as long as they are not properly analysed - and these analyses laid down in books - actually playing them can be dangerously double-edged. The present 7 ' 'g4 wave seems to be headed in a different direction. Although at first Black's defensive barriers looked like they were going to be mercilessly demolished, the Winawer has again shown astounding resilience. But if noth- ing else, this time 7 Rg4 seems to have taken a firm hold on the status of being the main line. This development has considerably reduced the importance of the quiet, positional approach that dominated the image of the Winawer for decades (in between the peaks of 7 Rg4). There does not seem to be a lot of interest any more in the subtle implications of 7 Nf3 and 7 a4. Quite a change! For instance, in the 1970s the ques- tion of whether, after 7 <2>f3 Bd7 8 a4 Ra5, White should play 9 Jld2 or 9 Qd2. was highly topical. 9 Bd2 seems more natural, but 9 Rd2 has the advantage of reserving the right to play Ji.a3. 7 <2Bf3 Qc7 (this position also arises via
6...Qc7 7 Nf3 Ne7) 8 a4 b6 was another im-
portant variation in those days (and in a way it still is, but it catches the limelight far less often now than it did before). Black intends to play ...fia6, exchanging his queen's bishop, a uni- versal theme in the French Defence. White may want to thwart this plan at the cost of a tempo by playing 9 Jib5+ Ad7 10 Ad3. More recently and in the wake of 7 Rg4, the alternative 7 h4 has risen to (some) promi- nence. This is in fact an alternative way of start- ing an attack on the kingside right away. We now return to 7 g4 (Dy. The story of this position began with the cau- tious assessment that, if nothing better, Black can safely guard his g-pawn by playing 7...S)f5 and that perhaps the sharp 7...Rc7 is playable. If, after three quarters of a century, we replace
7...Nf5 by 7...O-O. this assessment is still the
same. But on what oceans of games, analyses and theoretical publications it is now based! To give just an idea of the progress opening theory has made here: once it was the position after 7..>c7 8 Qxg7 Sg8 9 'xh7 cxd4 (or al- ternatively 7...cxd4 8 Rxg7 Eg8 9 Qxh7 Qc7) that was considered the starting point for the sharp option. Nowadays we have to add at least the further moves 10 4)e2 Nbc6 1 1 f4 Ad7 12 Rd3 (if 12 cxd4 then Black has 12...Nxd4!)
12...dxc3 before theory 'really' starts. White has
two ways of taking on c3. In both cases. Black will try to prove that the many open files for his rooks and the insecure position of White's king provide ample compensation for his slight ma- terial deficit. One thing that has not changed is that it is still totally unclear who has the better chances. What is clear, though, is that this is a wonderful variation for lovers of sharp, com- plicated and uncompromising play and for lov- ers of the most thorough opening preparation. The safer option is of course to protect the g-pawn. The old 7...Nf5 lost most of its former glory in the 1960s when it was found that the endgame arising from 8 Ad3 h5 9 Rf4 cxd4 10 cxd4 Rh4 1 1 S'xh4 Qxh4 12 jkg5 is not easy for Black. But two decades later the bold 7...O-O has turned out to be an excellent successor to
7...€)f5. It looks risky to castle 'into it' and it
really is dangerous, but if Black plays with great accuracy (or if he knows his theory well enough) he need not fear the danger. The mod- em main line is to play 8 Ji.d3, intending to meet 8...c4 with 9 Jlh6! <?)g6 10 Axg6 fxg6 11 Bg5. In this rather static position Black seems to have a solid game but since he can hardly un- dertake anything, White can build an attack on the kingside at his leisure, starting with h4-h5. Therefore it has become more usual to play
FRENCH DEFENCE 369
8...<2)bc6, which admittedly leads to the same
type of position after 9 Rh5 4bg6 10 £jf3 Rc7
11 Ji.e3 c4 12 Jlxg6 fxg6 13 g4, but with two
extra tempi this should now be playable for Black. Nevertheless, this remains an important option for White. Another possibility is to play
8...f5 with the reply 9 exf6 Sxf6 10 Jlg5 2f7
11 QT15 g6 1 2 Qdl being the critical test, in all
of these lines a heavy positional struggle lies ahead. Three other moves have also grown into fully-fledged variations, but since they are not as popular as the two main lines I shall only deal with them briefly:
3...a6 is a far from obvious move, but Black
can afford it because 3 •-rid2 is such a slow move itself. The idea is to play ...c5 without being disturbed by jtb5(+), which is an im- portant move in the 3...c5 variation. After 4 Qgf3 c5, the pawn exchange 5 exd5 exd5 leads to a position from the 3...c5 4 exd5 exd5 line, with Black having circumvented 5 .b5+. If White wants to achieve more than this trans- position (or if he just wants something differ- ent) he should probably try 5 dxc5 Bxc5 6 Jld3. By avoiding the pawn exchange on d5, White restricts the scope of Black's queen's bishop.
3...Nc6 (N), insulting as it may be to the
classical mind (after all. Black is blocking his own c-pawn, which definitely wants to move forward in a 'classical' French Defence), is in fact a well-considered attempt to show up the dark side of 3 4')d2. Tarrasch Variation
3 Nd2 (D)
This alternative to 3 <R3c3 was first recom- mended by Siegbert Tarrasch (1862-1934), though he later came to condemn it. Neverthe- less, his name remained attached to this move that did not really prosper until long after Tar- rasch's era. White avoids the pin ...jLb4. He is also well- placed to deal with the closed type of position that arises from 3... f6 4 e5, perhaps even better than after 3 Qc3, since with the knight on d2, it will be easy to protect d4 with c3. But these pluses come with a price tag. The draw- backs of 3 'Sld2 (as compared to 3 foc3) are ob- vious: White has far less control over the central squares d4 and d5 and his queen's bishop is hemmed in. The great main lines of the Tarrasch are the radical reply 3...c5 and the more traditional
3...Nf6. which in spite of what was said above
has turned out to be eminently playable. The idea is to meet 4 c3 with 4...e5, not ex- actly an everyday occurrence in the French! The deeper point is that the alternative 4 Ngf3, though superficially a natural move, is in fact a slight concession because (as we are about to see in the 3...5)f6 line) the moves d2 and 4)gf3 do not necessarily go well together in the French. Black replies 4...£tf6 5 e5 -?)d7, switching to more classical means of attacking White's centre: he will play ...f6 or ...c5. Even
370 FUNDAMENTAL CHESS OPENINGS
the very slow ...£2Bb8 followed by ...b6 and ... .a6 is a realistic option in some cases.
3...Jle7 is almost equally unorthodox, yet
this move has become fairly popular in recent years. Black is subtly waiting for White (again!) to play 4 "2igf3, when he will 'normalize' the position with 4...£}f6 5 e5 or 5 3Ld3 c5 6 e5 Nfd7. In a closed variation of the Tarrasch like this, White's queen's knight often wants to move on to f3. With the king's knight on f3, the char- acteristic scheme of development Ne2 and £tf3 is no longer feasible. Naturally, for those who want to play a Ru- binstein Variation. 3 ?)d2 presents no prob- lems. By playing 3...dxe4 the difference be- tween 3 Nc3 and 3 4)d2 is swept aside without a murmur. All of these lines usually lead to much qui- eter and more straightforward play than 3 Ale3, although there are some sharp and chaotic lines here too, if both players choose to enter them. But overall, the Tarrasch has always been a fa- vourite with those players who wish to avoid the complexities of the Winawer and who pre- fer a sober, sterner game.
3 A3d2 c5
3 ... c5 (D) 4 exdS One could say that this move is a belated way of playing the Exchange Variation, but in fact there is hardly any connection with 3 exd5, for having played ...c5 Black has fundamentally altered the character of the position. If now
4...exd5. play will usually revolve around the
well-defined theme of the isolated queen's pawn (arising after an exchange of pawns on c5 or d4). If 4... xd5. the central pawn-structure is the same as in the Rubinstein Variation. 3 £3d2 c5 4 exd5 exd5 4 ... exd5(D) 5 43gf3 This move is in fact a striking example of the way opening theory is always looking for the very, very best move (a self-perpetuating search really). Instead of immediately isolating Black's d-pawn (by playing 5 dxc5). White is trying to get the same type of position in a slightly more favourable version. So instead of giving his op- ponent a free developing move (5...Bxc5) he waits, preferably until the bishop moves to d6 or e7. Another idea is to try to disrupt Black's de- velopment by playing 5 Bb5+. The point of this move is that after the natural reply 5...jLd7 (or 5...AJC6) 6 Re2+ 7 dxc5 Black cannot recapture on c5. This may lead to sharp play if White decides to hang on to his extra pawn but it usually boils down to an 'ordinary' isolated queen's pawn position in the end. for instance This advance against White's pawn-centre, hardly playable against 3 12)c3, is the classical answer to 3 <2)d2. Black takes advantage of the fact that the pressure against d5 has decreased by attacking d4.

But this confronts us with a more subtle problem of a positional nature: is it wise to exchange queens in a position where you are supposed to create active piece-play to compensate for the weak- ness of your isolated pawn? Most opening books deem this to be 'slightly better for White', but I would say it is really a matter of taste. A rather dr>\ technical sort of position is reached where some players will feel ill at ease while others may be perfectly comfortable. We now return to 5 <£}gf3 (D): "2)bxd7 8 O-O Be7 9 dxc5 Nxc5 is a little easier for Black than the 5...£!c6 line thanks to the disappearance of the two light-squared bish- ops.

B
This is one of the critical positions of the Tarrasch Variation. White will lay siege to Black's d5-pawn, or at the very least try to take maximum advantage of the blockading square d4. Black can freely develop his pieces, quite an achievement in the French, and will seek active counterplay.
3 Nd2 c5 4 exd5 Rxd5
4 ... Qxd5 (D) This leads to a sort of position which is rather different from the 4...exd5 line. Just like in the Rubinstein Variation, Black pennits his opponent to develop his pieces freely, but he provides him with no targets. 5 <21gf3 Again the rule of thumb of opening theory is never to choose the path of least resistance. Rather than playing 5 dxcS Bxc5, giving away a development tempo for free. White allows the opponent to take on d4, intending to recapture 5 ...

10 Rxd4 is a cautious alternative. While is
working on the assumption that an exchange of queens will be to his advantage, simply because Black's queen is actively placed on d6 and White's at dl is not. Whether this is indeed the case is moot. After 10...Rxd4 1 1 *53x44 Ad7 1 2 jLf4 Sc8, for instance, the positional tension has been reduced and it has become much eas- ier for Black to find a safe place for his king. The position after 10 '5>xd4 is the main start- ing point of the 4...Rxd5 variation. At first Black was satisfied with the solid but unpreten- tious 10... .e7 followed by 1 1...O-O. With more and more players taking an interest in this line, ambitious moves like 10...Nd7 and I()...a6 also came under scrutiny. Black can then continue aggressively with ...Rc7 and ...Ji.d6 and per- haps even castle queenside. It goes without say- ing that this can lead to a very fierce battle. After 10...a6 11 Se) >c7 12 Ab3 .d6, for instance, the meek 13 h3 is unlikely to worry Black, but after 13 Nf51? Ji,xh2+ 14 &h 1 O-O 15 2)xg7! no one knows what is going on. The point of White's last move is 15... xg? 16 Rd4 with a terrible attack, yet the cold-blooded zwischenzug 15...fid8 appears to keep Black's chances alive. Instead of 1 2.. Ad6 there is the slightly less provocative (and still quite sharp) 12...Jld7. Play might continue 13 Jlg5 O-O-O 14 Rf3, when rather than worry about defending f6, Black should probably lash out with 14...jLd6 again.

3 ... Nf6 For a long time it used to be thought that this move is asking for trouble, for at first glance the position after 4 e5 £3fd7 looks better for White than the similar 3 ?3c3 531'6 4 e5 <$3fd7. But on closer inspection, the position of the knight on d2 turns out to have some disadvantages as well.
4 c5 1671 (D)
Just like after 3 5)c3 4)f6 4 e5 Black can also play 4...43e4 here, which after 5 53xe4 dxe4 boils down to the same position (see page 355).
5 Jtd3
As always in positions with a (more or less) fixed pawn-centre, both sides have to think stra- tegically. Every decision is likely to have far- reaching consequences which cannot easily be corrected. The plausible developing move 5 5>gf3, for instance, runs into the problem that after 5...c5
FRENCH DEFENCE 373
some cases he will try to harass White s king. For instance after (7 <53df3) 7...Qb6 8 g3 cxd4 9 cxd4 Nb4- White is forced to go for the bold 10 5tf2, when 10...f6 1 1 4'g2 g5 is a fully realis- tic possibility. Some players anticipate this plan by playing 8 h4 (instead of 8 g3), but this leads to great complications as well after 8...cxd4 9 cxd4 jlb4+ 10 <4Bf2 f6. In many games Black has been successful with a knight sacrifice on e5 at some point, just to wipe out White's cen- tre pawns and expose his king. In fact, this is one of the sharpest variations of the entire Tar- rasch. The neutral 5 c3 is often played, but this only delays the moment of truth, for after 5...c5 White will have to cut the Gordian Knot and choose between 6 Nd3, 6 f4 and 6 <2)gf3 after all. 5 ... c5

12 Qa4 offers White a lead in development and
many open files for his pieces, but it does make this variation 'for specialists only'. 5 14 is of a different calibre altogether. White provides some extra cover for his e5-pawn and makes a first move forward on the kingside. Af- ter 5...c5 6 c3 "2!c6 the idea is to play 7 -2df3 (D), for the seemingly natural 7 23gf3 again runs into 7...Qb6. 6 ... <2Bc6 An alternative plan is to play 6...b6. fol- lowed by ...Jla6. Looking at the position from a purely static perspective, this exchange of the light-squared bishop (which we have come to know in this chapter as highly characteristic of this type of position) is excellent for Black. But if we take the dynamics of the situation into ac- count. this manoeuvre is far less impressive since White will make use of the time granted to him to strengthen his hold on the kingside, for instance with 7 4Be2 Ba6 8 Jcxa6 ;2xa6 9 O-O £3c7 10 Nf4 or 7 <2)h3 Ba6 8 .xa6 ?)xa6 9 Rg4. Assuredly, this is an interesting variation, This full-scale consolidation of White's cen- tre is closely related to the variation 3 ?3c3 "21f6

374 FUNDAMENTAL CHESS OPENINGS
sides can develop their pieces pretty comfort- ably. Even the passive queen's bishop will have reasonable prospects at d7. The deciding factor will be Black's backward pawn on e6 in com- bination with the blockading square e5. Will White somehow be able to take advantage of this? Will Black perhaps be able to play ...e5 at some point? These questions are not easy to an- swer. but they do determine the further course of the opening.

but only for those players who enjoy patiently nurturing long-term aspirations and who do not mind having to defend for a while.

8 cxd4 (D) Now White is well-prepared for 8...'S'b6 since he can reply 9 N£3, smoothly defending the d4-pawn, a major difference from the 5 Qgf3 variation.

However, the preparatory move S.-. bb is not strictly necessary for this plan. Nowadays most players prefer the immediate... 8 ... f6 In the early days of this line, White would sometimes try to punish this move with 9 Qf4. but this idea never aroused much enthusiasm.

Still, this remains an enter- prising option which may be attractive to those who do not relish the heavy positional prob- lems of the main line and who prefer something more concrete and tactical. 9 exf6 2)xf6 Black has eliminated the enemy outpost at e5, thus changing the character of the opening considerably. The position has become fairly open (by French standards that is) so that both This is to all practical purposes the starting point of this variation. Black now has to take a decision with far-reaching consequences: to allow his opponent to play 12 Ji.f4 or not? In itself this would be a positionally attractive ex- change of bishops for White as it would in- crease his control over e5. That is why it seems obvious that Black should reply ll...' c7. If then 12 g3, Black has at least provoked a small but significant weakening of White's kingside pawn-structure. But White has a subtle alterna- tive in 12 4Lg5, planning to achieve the desired exchange of bishops via another route: .h4-g3. In fact it is not at all clear that it is necessary to stop 12 Jlf4. After 11...O-O 12 Xf4, for in- stance, Black may try to take over the initiative by lashing out with 12..Bxf4 13 Nxf4 Ne4. For a correct evaluation of this line it is vital to work out the consequences of the exchange sacrifice 14 Ne2 2xf31? 15 gxf3 "2)g5. Caro-Kann Defence are 2 d3, 2 2)c3 d5 3 <2)f3 (or 2 <2)13 d5 3 Nc3) and 2 c4. By playing 2 d3 d5 3 4)d2 (D), White intro- duces the King's Indian Attack, just like 2 d3 in the French (sec page 347). Though no less ancient than the Trench, this move had to wait until far into the 19th century before it received any form of recognition. In fact, it was not until Capablanca and Nimzo- witsch started playing l...c6 in the 1920s and 1930s that it was accepted as a serious open- ing. And even then it was often given the de- rogatory (and completely undeserved) epithet 'drawish opening' until the final breakthrough in the 1980s. With more and more top players using the Caro-Kann, old prejudices disap- peared and l...c6 finally became what it is to- day: one of the most important and popular replies to 1 e4. Just like in the French Defence, Black is planning to play 2...d5, attacking White's e- pawn. He is using the c-pawn rather than the e- pawn to support this central advance because he wants to keep the c8-h3 diagonal open for his bishop. And no matter how closely related the starting moves l...e6 and l...c6 may be. this tiny difference immediately causes a funda- mental divergence. 2 d4 There are a number of alternatives, but the only ones that are accepted as fully satisfactory But there is a major difference between the position after I e4 e62 d3 d5 3 €)d2 and the one arising after I...c6 2 d,3 d5 3 2Bd2: Black now has the chance to take even fuller control over the centre by playing either 3...e5 or 3...g6 4 Ngf3 Bg7 5 g3 e5. A characteristic situation arises after 3...e5 4 <2)gf3 Ad6 5 g3 Qf6 6 jkg2 O-O 7 O-O 3e8. It could be said that White has declined to use his 'prerogative' and has de- cided to take the black pieces instead, for this is in fact a position from the Modern Defence (1 e4 g6) with colours reversed (see page 462). But of course there is always the extra tempo for White and although it is far from clear how important this factor really is, it does make this variation sufficiently attractive for many play- ers. And it should be noted that this is a line that requires little theoretical knowledge!
2 Nc3 d5 3 2)f3 (D) (or 2 2)f3 d5 3 < c3) is
another set-up the Caro-Kann shares with the French (see page 348), but its importance is far greater in the Caro-Kann. In fact, this line
376 FUNDAMENTAL CHESS OPENINGS
(prosaically called the Two Knights Varia- tion) used to be more popular than 2 d4 during the 1940s and 1950s. It is still a frequent guest in modern tournaments. on d5, 3 exd5 cxd5 4 cxd5, an important motif in the Panov and intended to be doubly danger- ous now that it comes in an accelerated version. The straightforward 4...Rxd5 is not very at- tractive because of 5 <22)03 (although players who are not inclined to worry about subtleties like a loss of tempo in the opening may in fact find this to be quite playable). The real problem is that the 'ideal' 4,..4)f6 (D) (intending to take back on d5 much more 'cleanly' with the knight) is also problematic. It is attractive for two reasons. Firstly. 3...d4 is not as strong as in the French Defence since after 4 <2)e2 Black has to lose a tempo with
4...c5 (the same goes for 3...<2)f6 4 e5 <2)fd7 5
d4, when Black will have to play 5...e6 and
6...c5). Secondly, after 3...dxe4 4 4)xe4 the
'standard' 4...JL15 is not as self-evident as one would expect because after 5 <S)g3 Bg6 6 h4 h6 (parallel to 2 d4 d5 3 <?)c3 dxe4 4 Nxe4 Jtf5; see page 382) White quickly seizes the initia- tive with 7 4}e51. If 7..Jlh7. the powerful 8 Rh5 would even force Black to bury his own bishop with 8...g6. Black's most popular defence to the Two Knights Variation is 3...Ng4, After the critical reply 4 h3. this either leads to a fierce tactical battle following 4...jLh5 5 exd5 cxd5 6 Bb5+ Nc6 7 g4 Bg6 8 ?)e5 or to a rather closed King's Indian Attack type of position stalling with 4...jlxf3 5 Qxf3; e.g., 5...e6 6 g3 Nf6 7 Ng2.
2 c4 too is far more than just a way of avoid-
ing the main lines. This move is intended as a subtle refinement on the Panov Attack (a dan- gerous enough line in its own right!): 2 d4 d5 3 exd5 cxd5 4 c4 (see page 378). Just like in the Two Knights Variation, the idea behind delay- ing d4 is to make it more difficult for Black to develop his pieces. White wants to meet the natural 2...d5 with a double exchange of pawns White has two destabilizing checks, 5 a4+ and 5 ,fi.b5+, to prevent an immediate recapture on d5. One critical line starts with 5 jLb5+ <?3bd7 (5...Jld7 is answered by 6 Bc4) 6 <2)c3. The question then is whether Black should qui- etly develop his kingside starting with 6...g6, or if he should break the pin with 6...a6. But even the simple 5 Nc3 <2)xd5 6 <9Af3 is a subtle test of
4...€jf6. White uses the time gained by delaying
d4 for an ultra-fast development of his pieces (while retaining the option of transposing to a Panov proper by playing d4 at a moment of his own choosing). The underlying relatedness of all opening theory is made clearly visible here. Against the Panov proper, 4...Nf6 5 2)c3 e6 is one of Black's best replies (see page 379). If then 6 <2)f3, Black has a choice between the solid 6..jLe7 and the aggressive 6...Jlb4, both transposing to a line of the Queen's Gambit Declined if play continues 7 cxd5 Q)xd5 (the Semi-Tarrasch; see page 19). By playing 2 c4 d5 3 exd5 cxd5 4 cxd5 Nf6 5 <2)c3 <2)xd5 6 <2)f3. White very cleverly eliminates the latter option.
CARO-KANN DEFENCE 377
for if Black now chooses 6...e6, then after 7 jkc4 (instead of 7 d4) the 'aggressive 7...±b4' no longer makes any sense, so Black is reduced to the 'solid' option 7...Jle7. This may look like hair-splitting, yet such expert and intricate jug- gling with openings and variations forms an es- sential part of modem opening theory. The fact that 2 c4 is a variation par excel- lence for players with a wide range of opening knowledge is further underlined by Black's main alternative 2...e5, which after 3 5)f3 d6 4 d4 £jd7 5 Q>c3 <2)gf6, takes us straight into an Old Indian Defence (see page 160)! Nevertheless (and again: just like in the French) maintaining the tension in the centre is still thought of as the most critical test of Black's opening. In this case, though, it is almost irrelevant whether this is done by 3 <2k3 or by 3 4*3d2 for in both cases 3...dxe4 is the standard reply. This is in fact a major difference between the French and the Caro-Kann Defences. The many alternatives to 3...dxe4 that Black has in the French are conspicuously absent in the Caro-Kann. If a player chooses l...e6, it does not necessarily follow that he is fond of 3...dxe4 positions. But if someone plays the Caro- Kann, then that is precisely what he is aiming for. Exchange Variation 3 exd5 cxdS White now has two fundamentally different plans to choose from. He can either continue the fight for domination of the centre by lashing out with 4 c4 (this is the Panov Attack, which we shall deal with next) or he can interpret the position as a Queen's Gambit Declined Ex- change Variation (see page 22) with colours re- versed.
4 JSLd3
Willi that in mind, this is a very nice move, making it much more difficult for the opponent to develop his queen's bishop than in the 'real' Queen's Gambit. This then is the Caro-Kann Exchange Variation. 4 ... <2>c6 (D) In this position White (again) has a range of options which look similar to the French De- fence, but the consequences are rather different. The exchange option, for instance, 3 exd5, does not produce a symmetrical pawn-structure like it does in the French. Remarkably, this is not called the Exchange Variation (yet), for that name is reserved for the position after 3...cxd5, jfWhite does not continue 4 c4. If he does, we call it the Panov Attack.
3 e5 is called the Advance Variation, as in
the French, but because Black can reply 3...Bf5 he experiences far fewer problems, or so it seems at first sight. In fact, the Advance Varia- tion was thought to be inferior for this reason until in 1982 the whole variation, including this assessment, was overhauled and theory sud- denly took a few giant steps forward. Nowa- days, 3 e5 is one of the most popular ways of tackling the Caro-Kann. 5 c3
378 FUNDAMENTAL CHESS OPENINGS
his b-pawn by playing 7...Qd7 or 7...Rc8, White will continue 8 Nd2 e6 9 ?3gf3, which leads to a strategically clearly defined position. White's prospects are on the kingside, where he will try to start an attack based on a well-timed £se5. Black's prospects consist basically of a long-term plan of attack on the queenside with ...b5-b4.
7...43a5 8 Qa4+ Ad7 9 Qc2 is the most con-
troversial option. White has succeeded in chas- ing Black's bishop away from g4, but in doing so he has created another option for Black: to play 9...Qb6 preparing an exchange of bishops with I0...Bb5. This is more ambitious than the plain devel- oping move 5 5}f3, which allows Black to play
5...Ag4. White is not giving away any presents,
however small. 5 ... <2)f6
6 Nf4
Seen in the light of the previous note, it may look inconsistent that this is the main line rather than 6 h3, but there are other factors besides the development of Black's queen's bishop to be taken into account. 6 h3 has the definite draw- back of not contributing anything to White's development and by countering with 6...e5 7 dxe5 <53xe5 Black might 'punish' his opponent for his slow play. This position is very similar to a typical 3...c5 4 exd5 exd5 French Tarrasch Variation (see page 370), but Black's better de- velopment should make this position relatively easy for him. By playing 6 Jlf4, White admittedly allows ...Jlg4, but with the clear intention of putting this move to a severe test. After all, though an active enough developing move in itself, it leaves Black's queenside rather vulnerable, in particular the b7-pawn. 6 ... jlg4 If Black restricts himself to playing 6...e6. thus condemning his queen's bishop to passiv- ity, White can be happy with the result of the opening.

Panov Attack 3 exd5 cxd5 4 c4 The Panov Attack occupies a special place within the Caro-Kann for White is in fact play- ing a sort of Queen's Gambit (1 d4 d5 2 c4).

What White would really like to see now is his opponent simply (or lazily) taking on c4, either in this position or on one of his next few moves. After 5...dxc4 6 Jtxc4 e6 7 <2Bf3, for This is the most important starting position of the Exchange Variation. If Black 'simply' covers
CARO-KANN DEFENCE 379
instance, the position closely resembles a sim- ilarly 'lazy - line of the Queen's Gambit Ac- cepted (see page 44). In both cases. Black handles the opening in a way which is aimed at avoiding subtleties and complications. This is a legitimate way of playing, but opening the- ory itself does exactly the opposite. Its motto is always to look for something even more ac- curate, even more subtle or even better. This critical attitude has produced three main lines in this position: 5...g6, 5...Nc6 and 5...e6. In all three cases, White will need to act energeti- cally if he is to obtain any sort of opening ad- vantage at all. In other words: White will have to continue in true Panov style. If 5...g6, the sharp 6 Qb3 is critical. Since taking on c4 is now really unattractive (after
6...dxc4 7 jLxc4 e6 8 d5 Black is in serious
trouble) Black is practically forced to sacrifice a pawn by 6...Jlg7 7 cxd5 O-O. When studying this position, two questions need to be answered. First, will Black be able to recapture the pawn with a manoeuvre like ...i?2bd7-b6xd5, or will White manage to protect his extra pawn, for in- stance with Be2-f3 and aLg5xf6? Second, will the extra pawn be of any use to White if it takes almost an entire army to defend it? A somewhat more lucid version of this plan is to play 6 cxd5. If then Black does not recapture, and plays sim- ply 6...Jlg7, White will have a few extra op- tions like 7 jLc4 and 7 jcb5+. If Black does recapture, with 6... xd5, the idea is to play ei- ther 7 ',8'b3 or 7 iLc4, attacking the d5-knight. It is an intriguing question whether the position after, say, 7 Qb3 $3b6 8 d5!? i.g7 9 Jue3 O-O 10 £dl offers White better chances than the 6 Rb3 line. Precisely because White does not have an extra pawn (no doubled pawns on the d-file), his advanced post at d5 is easier to defend and for this reason possibly more effective. By playing 5,..i2)c6 (D), Black immediately attacks d4, thus restricting his opponent's free- dom of movement. If 6 4T3 Black continues in similar fashion with 6...Ag4. This controversial variation has to be judged by the consequences of the sharp continuation 7 cxd5 Nxd5 8 Rb3 Axf3 9 gxf3. White is fighting for the initiative at the cost of his pawn-formation. If 9...'R3xd4? 10 .b5+! Black loses a piece, but the outcome of 9...e6
10 Rxb7 Qxd4 11 i.b5+ Nxb5 1 2 Rc6+ ! Qe7
1 3 Rxb5 or 9,..Nb6 10 d5 2Bd4 (or 10 ±e3 e6 1 1 O-O-O) is far less easy to judge. White can avoid these problems by choosing 6 jLg5, only to run into others (of course!). For instance, af- ter almost a century of changing assessments it is still not clear how strong, after the natural continuation 6...e6 7 <?2>f3 jLe7, the aggressive 8 c5 really is. Besides, Black has a number of sharp alternatives, most notably 6...Qa5 (based on 7 ,Nxf6 exf6 8 cxd5 Bb4!), the odd-looking but surprisingly effective 6...Be6 and 6...dxc4 (here this previously 'lazy' capture is quite a critical line due to the attack on White's d4- pawn). With 5...e6, Black does not hurry to pul pres- sure on his opponent's pawn-centre. He simply strengthens his grip on d5 and prepares to de- velop his kingsidc. This is where all boundaries between 1 e4 and 1 d4 theory evaporate. After 6 CAD Black has a choice between 6... .e7 and
6...jLb4. In both cases 7 cxd5 £3xd5, transpos-
ing to a variation of the Queen's Gambit De- clined (see page 20), is the usual continuation. But there is yet another surprising transposi- tion: after 6...Jl.b4 7 Bd3 dxc4 8 jNxc4 O-O 9 O-O a fundamental position of the Nimzo-Indian Defence (see page 70) has arisen. Advance Variation
3 e5 (D)
Strange as it may sound, theory of the Ad- vance Variation is practically brand new. For
380 FUNDAMENTAL CHESS OPENINGS
HiKKI decades nobody was interested, since 3 e5 was not taken seriously. The old theoretical 'assess- ment' can be summarized as follows: "Black plays 3... .f5 and since he has developed his queen's bishop outside his pawn-chain he now has an improved version of the Advance French. Black will play ...e6, probably ...c5 at some point and he has solved 'the problem of the French bishop', period." Sometimes the variation 4 jLd3 i.xd.3 5 ''Sfxd3 was added to show how little promise this line holds for White. Today, this view of the Advance Variation has changed beyond recognition. 3 ... i.f5 Black has also experimented quite success- fully with 3...c5, but some expertise is needed here to avoid ending up a tempo down com- pared to an Advance French. But 3...Ji.f5 remains the most popular and shaipest line. White now has a far wider choice than older theory suggested. Far from simply exchanging Black's queen's bishop, for in- stance, it is now considered great sport to in- vent new ways of using this bishop as a target: 4 43c3 is the sharpest variation. White waits for Black to play 4...e6, cutting off the bishop's retreat, and then attacks with 5 g4 Jlg6 6 #3ge2
(D).
The idea is to play 7 Qf4 followed by 8 h4 or
7 h4 immediately. If Black creates a much-
needed square for his bishop with ...h6 or ...h5, White exchanges on g6, leaving Black (after ...fxg6) with a weakness at g6. This simple plan, which became popular in 1982, has proved to be remarkably effective. Black has all sorts of ways to defend himself, but the threats loom- ing over his position require great accuracy in defence. But perhaps even more remarkable than the proven soundness of this attacking line was the discovery that even a very quiet set-up holds out promise of an opening advantage. To play 4 Ad3 is to misunderstand this idea com- pletely, but the simple 4 4hf3, for instance (a move which before 1990 did not even get a mention in the books), is very sound indeed. After 4...e6 5 .Ne2 c5 6 O-O Nc6 7 c3 cxd4 8 cxd4 Nge7 9 Nc3 <2)c8 10 Ji.e3 <2)b6 1 1 Bel Black certainly has a solid position, but there is nothing wrong with White's 'normal' space advantage in a position of this type and the 'ac- tive' position of Black's f5-bishop does not trouble him at all. A subtle variation on this theme, and one of the most recent additions to White's armoury, is to play 4 jLe3, with the idea of first developing the queenside (4...e6 5 ?Jd2), retaining the op- tion of playing f4 and even c4 in some cases. The immediate 4 c4 is also not bad. Rather than wait for Black to play ...c5, White takes the initiative on the queenside himself. If Black ex- changes pawns on c4, he will get a beautiful square at d5 for his knights, but White will ob- tain e4 and c4 for his own pieces. Many players prefer to preface this plan with an advance on the kingside: 4 h4. Black cannot reply 4...e6? because of 5 g4 Jlg6 6 h5 and after
4...h5 5 c4 Black's h-pawn may become a tar-
get.
CARO-KANN DEFENCE 381
3 Nc3 I 3 d2
3 4)c3/d2 In contrast to the situation in the French (1 c4 e6 2 d4 d5) there is hardly any difference be- tween these two knight moves. In both cases
3...dxe4 is by far the most usual reply, when 4
43xe4 reconnects the two roads. The main difference between 3 *2}c3 and 3 Nd2 lies in the possibility of Black playing
3...g6 instead of 3...dxe4. Fianchettoing the
king's bishop makes the opening a close rela- tive of the Modern Defence, l...g6 (see page 462), which became a popular reply to 1 e4 in the 1960s and influenced several other open- ings, inspiring (among others) this variation of the Caro-Kann. Until then, the sturdy 3 4)c3 had been the self-evident way of preparing for the equally self-evident 3...dxe4. but when all of a sudden 3...g6 required some attention as well, it seemed a good idea to take another look at the alternative knight move 3 42d2. And it is true that in this case 3,..g6 loses some of its bite for c3 will protect d4 very firmly and put a ma- jor obstacle in the diagonal of the bishop about to appear at g7. For this reason 3 i2)d2 became all the rage in the 1970s and 1980s. But the huge process of change the Caro- Kann has gone through since then has reduced any 'fear' of 3...g6 to something resembling a child's fancy. Nowadays White is facing much harder theoretical problems! In fact, anyone playing 3 42c3 today may even be quietly hop- ing for his opponent to take the game away from the major theoretical battles by playing 3...g6. Theory of these lines concentrates mainly cn 3 43c3 g6 4 42f3 aLg7 5 h.3. reaching a position that will (briefly) be mentioned in the section on 1 e4 g6 (see page 463). About the sister vari- ation 3 42d2 g6, theory has little to say. White usually continues 4 'SigfS Jlg7 5 h3 or 5 c3. when sooner or later Black exchanges pawns on e4 after all, bringing about the characteristic pawn-formation of the Caro-Kann, but without any theoretical do's and don'ts to go with it. 3 ... dxe4 4 43xe4 ( D) No matter how interesting and important all the previous variations may be, it is not until this point that we enter the true heartland of the Caro-Kann. In a way that is perhaps less obtru- sive, but every bit as principled as the Panov Attack or the Advance Variation, White is chal- lenging the correctness of 1 ...c6. For in this po- sition Black has to prove that having a pawn on c6 rather than e6 (as in the Rubinstein Variation of the French) is useful. The classical method of doing so is 4..Bf5, which is not surprisingly called the Classical Variation. The main alternative, less obvious but profound and very popular nowadays, is to play 4...Nd7.
4...42.6 is more direct than either of these
main lines, but far less popular. This move is in fact the starting point for two variations, for af- ter the critical reply 5 42xf6+ Black has two ways of recapturing, both of them sound but very different in character:
5...exf6 has never been what you could call a
popular line, but it occupies an important little place in opening theory all the same. It is solid and fairly simple strategically, but it must be admitted that Black is making a positional sac- rifice of some sort. In exchange for obtaining open files, free development for all of his pieces and a safe place for his king (supposing that Black castles kingside) Black accepts a doubling of pawns which may eventually boil down to a virtual pawn sacrifice. For if White manages to obtain a passed pawn on the queenside, Black will have nothing to show for it on the kingside. This line is clearly a matter of taste.
5...gxf6 (D) is almost the exact opposite of
the straightforwardness of 5,..exf6.
382 FUNDAMENTAL CHESS OPENINGS
IV
5 43g3 A move which is both defensive and counter- attacking. The contours of the opening struggle are beginning to show: White does not simply take it for granted that Black's bishop is going to be actively placed. He will attack the bishop and do his utmost to try to make Black regret that he ever developed it.
5 Q'lcS is the only other more or less popular
move in this position. It is usually played to avoid the long theoretical main line. The pawn sacrifice 5 Jid3 'Sxd4 is almost never played. 5 ... Ag6 6 h4 The simple developing move 6 ?3f3 is less ambitious, though certainly not bad. After
6... 3d7 both 7 Ji.c4 and 7 Jcd.3 are played. In
contrast to the situation in the main line (where h4 and ...h6 have been inserted). Black is not forced to take on d3 after 7 Jld3. He has the ex- cellent alternative of letting the opponent take on g6 himself and recapturing with the h-pawn. Instead of these bishop moves. White also has the option of returning to the main line with 7 h4. Although the ?3h3-f4 manoeuvre is no longer possible (see below), the reply 7...h5 (rather than 7...116) is almost never played. The true Caro- Kann player prefers yielding a little bit of space to giving up control over an impor- tant square like g5. A more subtle plan is introduced with 6 <R31e2. or 6 jlc4 followed by 7 ?31e2. White wants to put a knight on 1'4, perhaps to take on g6 in some positions but more importantly to pre- pare h4 when the reaction ...h6 will no longer By recapturing with the g-pawn. Black is not aiming for clarity, but for darkness. He is not trying to get his pieces healthily and easily de- veloped in a position with clear positional land- marks; he is heading for a position where both sides have no idea what is going on. Or, to put it more positively. Black is playing for flexibility. He will probably try to get his queen's bishop developed at f5 or g4, he will usually play ...e6 (but sometimes ...e5, or - at a later stage - ...e6-e5), but where the other bishop will go, or which side he will castle, is completely unclear. There are hardly any well-defined variations to speak of. A plan based on 6 c3 Jtf5 7 <23f3 fol- lowed by g3, Jig2 and O-O is probably the most common nowadays (and considered quite diffi- cult for Black), but any number of other set-ups is possible. This is perhaps an ideal opening system for players with great self-confidence, good intuition and little or no taste for theoreti- cal knowledge, but at the very highest level (where not only self-confidence but confidence in the actual openings you play must be a hun- dred percent) this variation, which used to be fairly popular in the 1960s and 1970s, has be- come a rare bird. Classical Variation 4 ... Af5 (D) This simple, powerful move is the rock on which the Caro-Kann was built.

be an option. If after Nf4xg6, Black has to take back with the f-pawn, his pawn-formation on the kingside is ruined. A possible answer to 6 Nle2 is 6...e6 7 <2)f4 jildb in order to meet 8 h4 with 8...Rc7, undermining the f4-knight. If 6 Jlc4, the reply 6...e6 7 <2)le2 <2Bf6 is considered critical. White then not only has 8 Nf4 but also
8 O-O Bd6 9 f4. The idea is to play 10 f5 and
start an attack on the kingside. 6 ... h6
6...h5 may look rather good al first glance,

8 h5 Jch7
9 Nd3
Having chased the black bishop for four moves on end, White now forces an exchange, thus gaining a 'free' developing move for his queen. Yet the outcome of the opening battle re- mains undecided, for it is still unclear who ben- efits from the action so far. 9 ... ±xd3 10 >xd3 (D) Black now has three options, all of them equally logical, practically interchangeable even (in many cases they simply transpose), yet all with a peculiarity of their own. By playing 10...S'c7 Black (probably) pre- pares castling queenside, something which was once seen as self-evident, but since the 1980s and 1990s, when the idea of castling kingside reached maturity, any such self-evidence has disappeared. If Black does want to castle queen- side then it is of course perfectly reasonable to play 10...'S'c7. but if he does not (or if he wants to keep both options open) this queen move is not strictly necessary and either 10...Ngf6 or
10...e6 may well be more accurate. We shall
lake the latter as our main line. 10 ... e6(D) For White, the question which side to castle is not an issue. With his h-pawn as far advanced as h5 and with the spatial advantage this ad- vance has yielded on the kingside, it is obvious that he should direct his attacking forces to that The classical reply to 7 S)f3, preventing 8 4)e5. However, around 2000 two other moves came into fashion that not only challenged this line of reasoning but even attempted to radi- cally turn it around: 7...e6 and 7...W6. It does not seem logical that Black should voluntarily lose a tempo with 8 <2he5 ±h7, but the idea is then to exchange White's proud knight with ...l?)bd7. If this plan succeeds, it is indeed doubt- ful if 8 <22Be5 was such a good idea after all. An- other argument in favour of these 'new' moves is that Black will have a few extra options (as compared to 7...Nd7) if White refrains from 8 and simply continues 8 h5 Y,h7 9 Nd3. For instance, if 7...<2)f6 8 h5 Jth7 9 Nd3 Nxd3
3X4 FUNDAMENTAL CHESS OPENINGS
1 2 c3 Jce7 is another option. Black assumes that the extra move c3 is a slight weakening of White's queenside, an extremely subtle line of thinking and very difficult to judge. 11 ... Ngf6

side of the board and bring his king in safety on the opposite wing. But White faces a more subtle problem: where to develop the queen's bishop? The choice is normally between d2 and f4. 11 ±d2 The third option, 1 1 Ae3. has been held in contempt by opening books and players alike throughout the ages, presumably because of the opportunity that Black is given to eliminate the bishop with ...£2f6-g4. 1 1 Jid2 and 11 Jlf4 are about equally popu- lar. Of these two moves, the same can be said as about Black's choice of three moves or. the pre- vious turn: they are almost interchangeable and yet they are also unique. Interchangeable es- pecially if Black decides to castle queenside. Unique mainly if he does not. In the days when queenside castling was still the self-evident main line, both 1 1 ,.Nd2 Rc7 and 1 1 ,Nf4 'S'a5+ 1 2 a).d2 Rc7 were played to reach the same po- sition. Though both of these lines are still played today, the criteria for deciding between 1 1 J..d2 and 1 1 Jtf4 have changed. To begin with, White has to consider which square is best for the bishop in case Black castles kingside, for in that case the variations do not converge. Most play- ers seem to prefer f4, but this again has the drawback of inviting a few unorthodox alterna- tives that are not available after 11 aLd2 and which have served very well against 1 1 Bf4. For instance, after 11 Jlf4 Qa5+ 12 Jcd2 the surpris- ing 12...Bb41? 1 3 c3 ake7 has been played. With the black queen at a5, White is prevented from castling quecnsidc. The immediate ll... ,b4+ Now Black is at a crossroads: which way should he castle? The old and respectable (and still very much alive!) plan is to play I2...Rc7 followed by castling queenside (of course, if Black wants to play this versus 1 1 Jff4, he needs to have in- serted a check on a5, viz. 1 1 ...Qa5+ 12 .fi.d2 Rc7, as mentioned above). White has tried a variety of replies, of which 13 4'je4 O-O-O 14 g3 with the idea of playing 15 Ji.f4 has been the undisputed main line ever since the 1980s. A characteristic follow-up is 14,..Nxe4 15 Qxe4 Ji.d6 (to stop 16 Jtf4) 16 c4 (intending to chase the bishop away from d6 by playing 17 c5) 16...c5. This leads to a lively battle for control over the centre after either 17 d5 or 17 Ac3. The modem (and still highly controversial) choice is to play 12...Jte7 followed by castling kingside. Here too, White has a variety of pos- sible replies. Black's play is very provocative and an assault on the kingside is likely to be im- minent, though what exactly White should play is not clear. The manoeuvres e2 (preparing QJe5) and Ne4 (freeing the way for an advance of the g-pawn - and not to g3 this time but to g41), are likely to be vital elements of his plan, but the difference between 1 1 Jtd2 and 1 1 Jif4
CARO-KANN DEFENCE 385
becomes tangible here. Two examples of what might happen in either case: a) With the bishop on d2, 13 'e2 O-O 14 ifebl c5 is a popular line. In this position the im- probable pawn sacrifice 1 5 <15 !? has been tried, in order to add just that little bit of extra bite to White's attack that seems to be lacking after the 'regular' 15 dxc5 J",xc5. If 15...Nxd5, White simply plays 16 <R264 followed by 1 7 g4 and if
15...exd5 the idea is to start hacking away at
Black's kingside with 16JLxh6!?gxh6 17 $2f5. b) With the bishop on f4, it is 13 'A'bl O-O 14 42e4 that has received most of the attention. White intends simply to play 15 '2)xf64-, forc- ing his opponent to choose between allowing g4 (by replying 15...Jlxf6) or allowing Q2e5 (if he plays 15...Nxf6).
4... d7
4 ... Nd7 (D) In short: this is a profound and perfectly healthy strategic idea. It is not a coincidence then that 4...Nd7 has become at least as popular and perhaps even more important than the classical 4...flf5. Nev- ertheless. the success of 4... 2d7 is of recent or- igin. Before Anatoly Karpov started playing it on a regular basis in 1987, it was often thought (totally undeservedly) to be 'just a little too pas- sive". But as a result of Karpov's success, many of the world's top players have now adopted
4...<25d7. Theory of this opening system (which
sadly lacks any widely accepted name) has been enriched with a huge number of sharp and original variations. White will have to do a little more than just merrily develop his pieces if he wants to tight for the initiative in this position (as he should if he intends to be taken seriously by opening the- ory). After 5 41f3 Ngf6 6 4t)xf6+ <2)xf6, Black can be satisfied with the result of the opening af- ter 7 Nd3 i.g4 or 7 Nc4 4,f5 (7...Ng4? would now be a mistake because of 8 .xf7+! Nxf7 9 <?2e5+), for instance. Positionally more to the point is 7 Ne5, in order to prevent 7...Jlg4. But White's most promising option of adding real depth to is to play 6 51g3 (instead of 6 <22>xf6-f-). By refusing to exchange on f6. White makes it more difficult for Black to liberate his queen's bishop. But the price that he pays is the loss of time involved in <2)g3 (for this is not a develop- ing move) and the relatively passive position of his knight at g3. This was in fact the main line of 4...!53d7 until the 1960s, but it has now faded into the background. Practice has shown that Black has the excellent option of switching to the standard plan of the Rubinstein Variation of the French Defence (see page 353) by play- ing 6...e6 7 Jld3 c5. Although strictly speak- ing White is a tempo up compared to a sideline of the Rubinstein (because of the loss of time involved in ...c6-c5), he has fewer and less dangerous possibilities of hindering Black's further development than in the standard Ru- binstein because his own loss of time with his knight is at least as serious. As a result, this line is now considered fairly harmless, but it does have the merit of illus- trating a theme that is crucial to the 4...'S)d7 Superficially, this move does not seem to make any sense. Isn't the whole idea of the Caro-Kann to develop the queen's bishop? But a closer inspection of the position reveals that far from giving up on this plan, Black is in fact refining it. His idea is to play ...<2)gf6 first (and in a way so as to be able to recapture on f6 with the other knight, hence 4...£kl7) and then de- velop the bishop. He thus not only pre-empts the usual harassment of his bishop (as in the Classical Variation), but he also obtains the op- tion of playing ..Bg4, a development which in many cases is even more effective than ..Bf5.
386 FUNDAMENTAL CHESS OPENINGS
The alternative 5...2idf6 (keeping the c8-h3 diagonal open) - although certainly playable - is not as strong in this position as it is after 5 Ad3 or 5 '3?e2, for it has the drawback that after 6 2>g5 further concessions are needed: unless Black plays 6...e6 after all, he will have to go for 6...N)d5 or 6...<2)h6. neither of them particu- larly good-looking moves. 6 2>g5 e6 White has achieved what he set out for: Black's queen's bishop is locked up inside his own pawn-chain. Now he faces a problem him- self: what to do with the floating knight?
7 Re2
An important move. By threatening 8 2xf7 (8...Qxf7 9 >xe6+ Ng6 10 Ad3+ Nh5 1 1 Rh3#) White forces his opponent to make an- other defensive move. 7 ... 2>b6 (D) Superficially this may look like an attractive reply to White's previous move. Black wards off the threat of 8 21x17 (for the e6-pawn is now protected) while at the same time attacking White's bishop and the d4-pawn. But at a deeper level this move (again) constitutes a slight con- cession to White's aggressive opening play: now that the route for his queen's bishop to f5 or g4 has been blocked off. Black's would have liked to fianchetto his queen's bishop. Putting a knight on b6 hardly fits into this plan. variation: the idea of forcing or provoking Black to play ...e6, encapsulating his queen's bishop. This cannot be called a goal in itself, for the fate of the 5 2)f3 line clearly shows that Black can well afford to play ...e6 if the circum- stances are right. The question is: can White do any better than 5 5)f3? The answer to this question is sought mostly in 5 Bc4. intending to meet 5...2igf6 with 6 Ng5, and in the immediate 5 2)g5, when White can reply to 5...2)gf6 with 6 jld3, with plans based on some surprising tactical points. 5 aid3 intends to meet 5...2igf6 with 6 Ng5, and is thus the somewhat more conventional- looking sister variation of 5 2g5. However, it is less popular because of the reply 5...2)df6, which leaves White short of an effective and aggressive continuation. If White adopts the 5 21g5 move-order instead, then he can meet
5...Q3df6 by 6 2il f3 or 6 3Lc4 (see 5 ±c4 2>df6
below). Those who fancy a good opening trap may- feel tempted to continue 5 Re2. hoping that Black will fall for 5...2igf6?? 6 2)d6n. How- ever. if Black prefers the more sensible 5...2)df6. White's queen will not be particularly well- placed on e2.

tion of his knights and this really is the crucial point of the entire variation: White has man- aged to force a few positional concessions from his opponent, but do these outweigh the time he has had to invest? It stands to reason that Black has to react quickly though, for if White is given the chance to play <?2)lf3 (allowing the other knight to drop back to c4) his problems are solved. The critical variations as regards 8 "b3 start with 8...h6 9 <2)5f3 (if 9 Ne4 Black can now safely take on d4) and now either 9...c5 imme- diately or 9...a5 first with the idea of playing ...c5 a little later (for instance, 10 a3 a4 1 1 Ba2 c5). Against 8 Bd3 the main line goes 8...116 9 <5A5f3 c5 10 dxc5 i.xc5 1 1 21e5 bd7 12 <£gf3 Rc7. Black is challenging White's control over e5 and frees the way for a natural plan of devel- opment: ...O-O, ...b6 and ...Bb7.
4...43d7 5 g5
5 <ag 5 (D) coming to terms with this line. Having to dodge a few heavy blows first and then still being forced to play with great accuracy for several moves in order to avoid falling into a passive position, this is not an easy task. And though by now the worst of the storm is over, it is clear that 5 $Jg5 has come to stay. Today, in the early years of the 21st century, it is this very move that must be considered the real main line of the
4... d7 variation.
5 ... $lgf6 (D) The first point of 5 <2)g5 comes to light if Black unsuspectingly replies 5...h6?!: if you did not see 6 Ne6! coming (as Black) you will be greatly relieved to find that you do not have to resign on the spot. But all the same, after

Black's position is bad enough. The knight on e6 is still taboo: 8...fxe6?? 9 Qh5+ Nd8 10 Ba5 costs Black his queen. This is the deeper idea behind 5 g'5.

The alternative 6...Nb6 avoids any such problems, but without attacking a bishop on c4, This most unusual knight move caused a ver- itable revolution in the 4...<R3d7 variation be- tween 1987 and 1989.

By dropping the knight back to e4, White relinquishes any ideas of a blitzkrieg and it looks as if Black has weathered the storm. But now the second and perhaps the most diffi- cult phase of the opening battle begins. 9 ... 2>xe4
10 Qxe4 (D)
This is the great starting position of the 5 £}g5 fine. Just as in the 5 Nc4 variation, White has prevented the development of Black's queen's bishop via the c8-h3 diagonal, albeit at the cost
[diagram]
now is whether Black will be able to execute the alternative plan of developing the bishop on b7, preferably in combination with the powerful ad- vance ...c5. The most plausible method of doing so is to play 10../z3f6 and after 1 1 Rc2 continue with
11...b6 12 .d2 .b7 13 O-O-O Qc7, but a draw-
back of this straightforward and thematic play is that White is given firm control over e5; e.g., 14 3e5 O-O-O 15 f4. To avoid this, the subtle
10...Rc7 is often played. While retaining con-
trol over e5, Black prepares ...b6 (or ...c5, de- pending on White's reaction). The weak link in this plan is Black's g7-pawn. After the sharp reply 1 1 Rg4 Black has nothing better than 1 1,..'sfcf8. giving up the right to castle. The next question is: does this really matter? After 12 O-O c5 a fierce battle is in the offing. 7 ... jLd6 Black still has to tread carefully. 7...h6. for instance, may be playable now. but Black has to be prepared for a complicated defensive task if White decides to sacrifice a piece for the initiative with 8 vi)xe6 (which is one of the main ideas behind the whole 5 Ng5 line). Both
8...fxe6 9 .g6+ S>e7 10 O-O and 8...Qe7 9 O-O
fxe6 10 .g6+ Qd8 lead to a position which is very difficult to judge (and to play!). Black's king cannot be brought into safety easily. 8 #e2 h6 Now that Black has made sure his position won't get disrupted by a piece sacrifice on e6, he can finally afford to play this move. Ironically, it is the seemingly more cautious 8...O-O that gets punished by 9 &3xe6 now (after 9...fxe6 10 Qxc6+ Qh8 1 1 Rxd6 White has simply won two pawns). 9 5)e4 Sacrificing on e6 is now less attractive be- cause after 9 ?3xe6 fxe6 10 Ag6+ S?e7 1 1 O-O <23f8 Black's defensive lines remain relatively Sicilian Defence century. But it is precisely this assessment which has changed dramatically. From a marginal phe- nomenon, the Sicilian grew into the most com- bative and aggressive reply to 1 e4 and it has been the most popular opening outright for many a decade now. It has turned out to possess a latent power and flexibility that has been the source of a wealth of new ideas and it is no ex- aggeration to say that l...c5 has become the crucial test of 1 c4. Players who do not feel comfortable with it will have to switch to an- other opening move. But for those who do man- age to master the Sicilian, be it with White or with Black (and preferably both, of course) it is a mighty weapon indeed. In fact, by playing l...c5 Black chooses the same strategy that underlies 1 c4 and 1 *2)1'3: he does not immediately occupy any central squares, but intends to control them from the flank with such moves as ...*Nc6, ...g6 and ...jLg7. He then has the option of striking back at a later stage, for instance with ...d5, but he is under no obli- gation to do so, for with a pawn on c5, Black also has a natural plan of attack on the queen- side: ...a6 followed by ...b5. This strategy calls for a clear answer from White. His range of options may be roughly di- vided into three categories: Plan A: White leaves the c5-pawn alone, calmly plays d3 at some point and contents himself with his stronghold at e4 and the poten- tial attacking chances on the kingside that go with it. Plan B: White plays c3, preparing an 'ideal' pawn-centre with d4 after all. Plan C: White plays d4 without c3 and re- captures on d4 with a piece. Plan C will normally produce a position where White has a spatial advantage and where (behind the broad back of the c4-pawn) he has every chance of developing his pieces easily If one opening could serve as a metaphor for the huge progress our understanding of chess has made in the course of the 20th century, from classical, in tune with clear, albeit static posi- tional features to modem, complex and highly dynamic, there is only one candidate: the Sicil- ian Defence. The name dates back to the 1 7th century, the first serious experiments and theoretical obser- vations to the 19th, but it was not until the 20th century that I ...c5 slowly developed into that magical tool for the great and terrible demoli- tion of the hegemony of both 1 ...c5 and of the entire classical school of thought of which that move is a product. Like l...e5, l...c5 prevents the formation of an ideal pawn-centre with 2 d4, but without giv- ing White the typical targets of the I e4 e5 openings: the e5-pawn and the a2-g8 diagonal with the vulnerable spot at f7. Nor does Black initiate any immediate skirmishing in the cen- tre, as he expressly does both with l...e5 and with the Caro-Kann and the French. This may sound a little passive, bent on avoiding a fight, and as a matter of fact this is exactly what peo- ple thought of the Sicilian Defence in the 19th
390 FUNDAMENTAL CHESS OPENINGS
and aggressively. It is this plan that has been perceived from the first as the critical test of l...c5. It is also precisely this type of position that has undergone the greatest shift in assess- ment: from passive (for Black) to highly dy- namic and with a multitude of possible plans (for both sides). It is in this soil that all the main lines of the Sicilian Defence are rooted, lines which have become so huge and complex that they could justifiably be regarded as independ- ent openings. In fact, an experienced player hardly talks about 'the Sicilian', but about 'the Najdorf or 'the Sveshnikov' (etc.) instead. And yet all these opening systems arc very closely related. There are countless transpositional pos- sibilities and for a thorough understanding of any single variation, a basic knowledge of some of the others is extremely useful. Because of this interconnectedness of all vari- ations and because many characteristic plans can be carried out in various ways, any form of systemization (such as I have attempted here) only makes sense to a very limited extent. We shall start with what I have termed Plan A. the most important implementation of which is 2 Qic3. the Closed Sicilian. 2 f4, 2 g3 and 2 d3 are variations on this idea. There is quite a lot of theory on these moves (as there is on all subvariations of the Sicilian), but the general consensus is that these lines are rel- atively less threatening to Black. The first two can even be called (respectably) marginal. Both against 2 f4 and against 2 g3 Black has the im- mediate 2...d5, a counterblow that 2 $k3 is in- tended to prevent. After 2 g3 d5 3 exd5 '#'xd5 it is unfortunate for White that his hl -rook is un- der attack, while after 2 f4 d5 3 exd5 Black can afford to play 3...4Jf6 since defending the pawn with 4 c4 leaves some nasty holes in White's pawn-structure that can be exposed with 4,..e6 5 dxe6 Axe6. With 2 d3 we enter the world of the King's Indian Attack. As we have seen in several ear- lier chapters, other gates to this world are situ- ated in the Reti Opening, the French Defence (see page 347) and the Caro-Kann (see page 375). It has a most distinctive atmosphere and a charm of its own which is so captivating to some players that they play it almost regardless of what the opponent is doing. Others are a little more judicious and play it only when the cir- cumstances are really favourable. Just by way of an example: instead of the immediate 2 d3 White might prefer 2 Qf3 and continue with 3 d3 only if Black chooses 2...e6, and not against other moves. The variation 2 d3 is interwoven with the Closed Sicilian. After 2...'2te6 3 g3 g6
4 Jlg2 jLg7, for instance, 5 *?3f3 produces what
you could call a 'pure* King's Indian Attack, 5 <23c3 transposes to the Closed Sicilian and 5 14 is a subtle attempt to improve on both moves. If
5 f4 e6 6 Nf3 7 O-O O-O. White can still
transpose with 8 ?3c3 but he also has the option of 8 c3, preparing the central advance d4. This takes us to what I have termed Plan B: c3 followed by d4. a plan which can be carried out in many different versions. White might play 2 Nf3, for instance, and continue with 3 c3 or not, depending on Black's reply, an option we shall examine more closely when discuss- ing 2 Q>f3. But the simplest and the most im- portant method of implementing this plan lies in 2 c3. the Alapin Variation. We then arrive at the main body of theory of the Sicilian: Plan C. For this, 2 Nf3 forms the logical introduc- tion and by far the largest part of this chapter will be devoted to variations starting with this move. A remarkable variation on this theme (or perhaps it is a hybrid between methods B and C is 2 d4. The idea of this move is not to meet
2...cxd4 with 3 Rxd4 (which would merely
give Black the developing move 3...Nc6 for free) but with 3 c3. This is the Morra Gambit, a strange way of turning things upside down: instead of playing c3 to prepare d4 White plays d4 to prepare c3! Black can transpose to the Alapin Variation with 3...d5 4 exd5 Qxd5 or
3... 3f6 4 e5 vrid5 if he likes, but the critical test
of this gambit is of course to accept it and play
3...dxc3. This brings us, after 4 5)xc3 (D). to
the starting position of this line. The differences from the position after the 'ordinary' move 2 €103 are few but their impact is considerable. White's c- and d-pawns have disappeared and so has Black's c-pawn. This opening of files changes the character of the
SICILIAN DEFENCE 391
position enormously. White is ready to develop his bishops aggressively while Black will have to make several pawn moves to do the same. The Morra Gambit is perhaps best described as a radical method of exposing 1 ...c5 as a non- developing move. Nevertheless, this is a vari- ation 'for specialists only'. White undoubt- edly has the initiative, but is this enough for a pawn? Black's position is flexible and con- tains no weaknesses. Possible continuations after 4...Nc6 5 <Nf3 are 5...d6 6 Ji.c4 e6 7 O-O <2)f6 and 5...e6 6 J.c4 a6 7 O-O <£!ge7, amongst many others. Naturally, there remain a few options that do not fit into my (or any) systemization of plans. The most remarkable of these is probably 2 b4. the Wing Gambit. White eliminates Black's c5-pawn and is hoping, after 2...cxb4 3 a3. to obtain both a strong pawn-centre (with pawns on e4 and d4) and a quick development of his queenside. 3...d5 is a good reply. A slow-motion version of this idea (but more radical for this very reason!) is to play 2 a3. pre- paring 3 b4. And finally, those who like 1 e4 but hate the Sicilian might try 2 c4, turning the opening into a rough version of the Symmetrical English. If play continues 2...Nc6 3 ?k3 g6 4 g3 .Ng7 5 aLg2 the roughness is smoothed out and we have reached a Botvinnik Variation (see page 201). Closed Sicilian
2 Cic3 (D)
Once upon a time, in the days when opening theory, even of the Sicilian Defence, was clear and simple, this move was the introduction to the nicely compact plan g3, Jlg2 and d3, fol- lowed by £jge2 (or 14 and <2)f3) and O-O. White hardly needed to take any notice of what his op- ponent was doing in the meantime, Black knew what he was up against, and everybody was happy. Naturally, such an attitude is still perfectly legitimate today, but it has long lost the self- evidence it once had. Modern opening theory is always digging deeper and is always looking for new directions, but it is also constantly searching for ways to outfox the opponent. For this purpose, juggling move-orders is a perfect tool. Almost everyone who plays the Sicilian (as Black) restricts his preparation against the main line 2 *2)f3 [d6/e6/<2)c6] 3 d4 cxd4 4 <2)xd4 to one or two variations. As we are about to see. these variations are primarily defined by Black's second and fourth moves. By playing 2 Qc3 rather than the standard 2 Nf3, the modern well-informed and flexible player forces his opponent to be on his guard not just for 3 g3, the classical Closed Sicilian, but also for a change of direction with 3 6}f3 and 4 d4. If Black does not want to be tricked into a varia- tion he does not know very well (regardless of how sound that variation might be in itself) he has to consider his reply to 2 <2)c3 very care- fully. 2 ... Nc6 This move used to be axiomatic, but nowa- days this is a highly technical matter. What
392 FUNDAMENTAL CHESS OPENINGS
Defence. It is one of White's best options of keeping the position closed without relinquish- ing his ambitions to obtain the initiative. If 2,..g6 there is also 3 f4 to consider, besides the 'standard' 3 5)f3 and 3 g3. By playing 2...e6, Black makes it clear that he is thinking in a different direction. Both 3 g3 and
3 f4 can now be met by a counter-thrust in the
centre: 3...d5. And if 3 <2hf3 (making 3...d5 de- cidedly less attractive because of the firm reply 4 exd5 exd5 5 d4), Black will choose between
3...?)c6, 3...a6 or 3...d6, with a Taimanov, a
Paulsen or a Scheveningen Variation in mind respectively. It is true that White has a plausi- ble alternative to 4 d4 cxd4 5 <5)xd4 against any of these three moves, but nothing that will greatly worry Black. If 3,..4)c6, he might con- sider 4 jlb5 (reaching the same position as after
2...£k:6 3 "?3f3 e6 4 jLb5); if 3...a6 White could
play 4 g3 (analogous to 2...a6 3 g3 below) and if
3...d6, there is the option of playing 4 d4 cxd4 5
Rxd4 4)c6 6 Jtb5 (compare this to the varia- tion 2 £jf3 d6 3 d4 cxd4 4 Rxd4; see page 435). Black even has a fourth option against 3 £rf3, which is to reply 3...Qf6, inviting a trans- position to the risky Nimzowitsch Variation by
4 e5 st3d5 (see page 401 ).
Probably Black's most adventurous second move is 2".a6. Against 3 g.3 the aggressive
3...b5 4 Ji.g2 Jcb7 looks quite acceptable and
against 3 4)f3 Black can either play 3...e6 or
3...d6. inviting a transposition to a main line, or
remain in (relatively) unexplored territory with
3...b5 4 d4 cxd4 5 Clxd4 ±b7.
We now return to 2...Qc6 (D): main line would Black like to play and what does he want to avoid at all cost? For instance, someone who is aiming for a Najdorf or a Dragon Variation is more likely to play 2...d6. If then 3 <5Bf3 he can simply reply
3...Nf6, when after 4 d4 cxd4 5 <?)xd4, 5...a6 or
5...g6 respectively will reach the desired result,
while in case of 3 g3 the reply 3...<2Bc6 4 jLg2 g6 5 d.3 Bg7 transposes to a standard position of the Closed Sicilian that is also reached via 2".4te6 and which we shall be looking at shortly. But there are two alternatives that a 2...d6 player has to take into account: 3 <£jge2 and 3 f4. The former repeats the dilemma of the pre- vious move: While is waiting for Black to show his hand before he decides to continue 4 d4 or 4 g3. The idea behind 3 f4 is rather different. White develops his bishop to c4 or b5 and plays d3. This is called the Grand Prix Attack. It may be a very aggressive strategy, for in some cases White continues f5, sacrificing a pawn to start an attack against the ever-vulnerable f7- square. A sample line (albeit an important one):
3 f4 Nc6 4 4"3f3 g6 5 Ji.c4 lg7 6 O-O e6 (D).

11 Hi
7 f5l? (simply 7 d3 4)ge7 8 Wei is also not bad), intending to meet both 7...exf5 and 7...gxf5 with the astonishingly calm 8 d3. Black has to be careful. If 7...gxf5 8 d3 4bge7. for instance, 9 £3g5 followed by 10 Rh5 might well get him into trouble very quickly. Playing 5 Bb5 (instead of 5 jLc4) embarks upon a different plan altogether. White vaguely threatens to exchange on c6. This 'Nimzo- Indian' motif is quite important in the Sicilian
SICILIAN DEFENCE 393
In this position White has all the options that we have just seen against Black's alternative second moves, and one extra. The classical move, opting for a standard Closed Sicilian, is 3 g3. The modern option is to play 3 Nf3. These are the main lines that we shall look into in rather more detail below. Then there are the 'regular' alternatives 3 14 and 3 <2)ge2 and finally there is 3 JLbS. a recent idea. 3 f'4 may be combined with either Bc4 or Bb5 as in the 2...d6 3 f4 version (see page 392). Bb5 is especially useful if Black plays ...d5, for instance in case of 3...e6 4 Nf3 d5 5 Jtb5. 3...g6
4 f3 i.g7 is a little more solid for Black than
in the 2...d6 3 f4 line. A perfect illustration of the growing popu- larity of Bb5 as a reply to ...4fic6 in countless different versions is the emergence of the varia- tion 3 JtbS. Until very recently it was unheard of to play this move in a position where there is no objection to the aggressive reply ...£}d4. Nowadays White simply retreats the bishop (3...5)d4 4 Bc4) and calmly continues with Nf3 and <2)xd4. By playing 3 Nge2, White delays the mo- ment to commit himself either for or against g3 for as long as he can. It is also a way of prepar- ing for the possible reply 3...e5, which is a ma- jor option in case of 3 ?jf3 (see page 395), for White can now take full possession of the d5- square with 4 Nd5 and 5 £tec3. But whether this manoeuvre is really something for Black to be afraid of is a moot point.
2 c3 c6 3 g3
3 g3 Superficially, this set-up is closely related to the King's Indian Attack, where White plays Nf3, g3, Ji.g2, d3 and (usually) Nbd2. But with a knight on c3 and the diagonal of White's g2- bishop unobstructed by a knight at f3, it is far more difficult for Black to start operations in the centre based on ...d5. This gives the Closed Sicilian a decidedly different flavour. 3 ... g6
4 Ag2 Ag7
5 d3 d6
The decisive factor in this variation is the po- sition of Black's e-pawn. 5...d6 is the most flex- ible move. Until the 1950s, 5...e6 was thought of as the main line, but then it was discovered that a plan based on ...e5 is often more solid, especially if White chooses a plan with 6 Jte3 and 7 Qd2. White intends to play Bh6. under- mining both Black's control over the centre and the safety of his kingsidc by the exchange of dark-squared bishops. This also enhances the prospects of a plan to advance in the centre after all: Ndl (or 4ke2) followed by c3 and d4.
6 f4 (D)
If now 6 Jte3, Black plays 6...e5. The same applies to the oldest move in this position: 6 Nge2. By playing 6 f4, White concentrates his forces more fully on the kingside. Ever since Boris Spassky successfully used this idea in the 1960s, it has been the main line. Black now faces a fundamental choice.
6...Nf6 is a healthy developing move, but it
is also a provocation, for this move is practi- cally begging to be 'punished' by g4-g5, an ad- vance that White would like to play in any case. But in the meantime Black advances on the queenside. This usually results in a full-scale battle with chances for both sides; for instance, 7 2tf3 O-O 8 O-O Zb8 9 h3 b5 and now 10 g4 b4 1 1 Ne2 a5 1 2 f5, or - a little more subtle - 10 a.3 a5 11 JsLe3. Those who would rather concentrate on the centre will prefer 6...c5, the same plan as is
394 FUNDAMENTAL CHESS OPENINGS
recommended against 6 Jl.e3 and 6 Nge2. If White continues 'as expected' with 7 42hf3, Black obtains a solid position by 7...Nge7 8 O-O O-O 9 .c3 ?Jd4. The critical move is prob- ably the unorthodox 7 5)h3. White keeps both the f-file and the d l-h5 diagonal open and this generates some dangerous attacking chances. After 7...Nge7 8 O-O O-O, for instance, there is the energetic pawn sacrifice 9 f5J? gxf5 10 Rh5. Now that White has committed himself to a f4 plan. Black's most solid option is perhaps to switch to 6...e6. This creates the opportunity to play ...f5 (as a reply to g4 for instance) blocking the enemy advance on the kingside. Again, there is one line out of the many possi- bilities that is particularly sharp and critical: 7 Nf3 <2)ge7 8 O-O O-O 9 jie3 (intending 10 d4) 9,..<S)d4 10 e5!?. This is in effect a pawn sacri- fice for after 10".&ef5 1 1 Nf2 Nxf3+ 12 Rxf3 53d4 White will have to play 13 Wdl. when Black can simply take his e-pawn. The idea is to meet 13...dxe5 14 fxe5 Axe5 with 15 <2)e4. White is threatening 16 c3, winning back the pawn and obtaining the upper hand in the cen- tre. Black can try to take the initiative himself by 15...f5 16 ?3xc5 f4.
2 Nc3 c6 3 Nf3
3 Nf3 (D)
variation he has in mind against the 'threat- ened' 4 d4. For those who play the Accelerated Dragon, the choice is easy. All they have to do is play
3...g6 and wait for 4 d4 cxd4 5 Nxd4, and their
favourite variation arises. The alternative 4 Ji.b5 is unlikely to worry them, for although not bad, this is definitely less threatening to Black than a regular Rossolimo Variation (2 f3 Cic6
3 Jlb5 g6) now that White has committed him-
self to Nc3 at such an early stage. The same applies to 3...e6, Anyone who is not worried about playing one of the main lines arising from 4 d4 cxd4 5 $jxd4 can safely play this move. 4 Jlb5 is a somewhat inflexible ver- sion of the analogous line 2 3f3 3 Jlb5 e6 (see page 402). Again due to the early Nc3. the option of playing 4 Ab5 against 3...d6 is comparatively harmless. If 4 d4 cxd4 5 5)xd4 instead, Black has three main lines to choose from: 5...g6 leads either to the Dragon Variation or the Ac- celerated Dragon after 6 Be3 Ag7 7 Jtc4 fb,
5...eb (probably) to a Scheveningen Variation
and after 5...?)f6 we have reached the starting position of the Classical Variation. But things are more complicated if Black plays 3...Nf6 (D). If one's repertoire against the main line of the Sicilian includes only the Sveshnikov Vari- ation (and this again only in the version 2 Qf,3 -Ncb 3 d4 cxd4 4 Nxd4 Nfb 5 Nc3 e5), this move is the only one that 'fits'. Unfortunately, it is precisely here that 4 Jtb5 is a fully-fledged This position also arises (and indeed more often!) via 2 Nf3 <2}c6 3 £jc3. Black will have to select a reply which is compatible with the
SICILIAN DEFENCE 395
alternative to 4 d4, mainly because 4...43d4 runs into the sharp 5 e5. Now that the Svesh- nikov has become one of the most important variations of the Sicilian, it is only logical that all the sidelines are also being turned upside down and this is one of White's most popular options of avoiding the Sveshnikov proper.
4...Qc7 is a spirited reply. Black prepares to
play ...Nd4 after all (after 5 O-O Nd4. for in- stance. 6 e5? is now bad because of 6...43xf3+ winning a pawn). Black's most important alternative, and the only way to turn 2 4Bc3 4Bc6 3 43f3 into an in- dependent variation (and consequently the only attempt at exposing White's opening play as 'dawdling'), is to play 3...e5, radically prevent- ing d4. This used to be thought inferior because of the hole in Black's pawn-formation at d5. but assessment of this positional feature has changed. If Black proceeds with the necessary caution. White's control over d5 should not un- duly bother him and his chances should not be worse than in comparable variations like the Stonewall Variation of the Dutch Defence (see page 177). After 4 i.c4 Ne7 (not 4...<£rf6?? 5 43g5) 5 d3 d6 6 O-O 4)f6 Black's position is sound. White would like to open the f-filc to in- crease the pressure against Black's kingside, but a variation like 7 Ng5 O-O 8 f4 exf4 9 Ji.xf4 h6 10 4)f3 Be6 is not overly dangerous for Black. A more subtle plan is to play 6 43d2 (in- stead of 6 O-O), intending not only to free the way for the f-pawn but also to play 4)fl-e3. However, this allows Black to get rid of his least active piece with 6...Bg5 followed by ...Bxd2 (or ...jlxcl, in case White plays 7 44f1 ). Alapin Variation
2 c3 (D)
It could be argued that this is the only move to take l...c5 seriously. White does not tiptoe around the c5-pawn, nor does he break the sym- metry by playing 2 4)f3 and 3 d4. He simply ac- cepts the fact that Black has prevented 2 d4 and is now taking steps to carry out this plan any- way. Stubbornness or common sense? Ironically, it is also the only move to suffer from the same defect as l...c5 itself: it is not a developing move. Quite the contrary in fact, for White voluntarily makes the c3-square inacces- sible to his queen's knight. This is really the Alapin Variation in a nut- shell. White's plan is to build up a strong pawn- centre and for this he is taking a certain slow- ness of piece development in his stride. If Black wants to expose a possible downside to this plan, he will have to act quickly and decisively. It is hardly surprising then, that the main lines start with 2...d5 and 2...41f6.
2...e6 is a solid option, but Black has to be
aware of the fact that after 3 d4 d5, 4 c5 trans- poses to the Advance Variation of the French (see page 351) and that 4 exd5 exd5 leads to a type of play which is very similar to the 3,..c5 4 exd5 exd5 variation of the Tarrasch French (see page 370). Not bad, but very un-Sicilian- like. The fianchetto 2...g6 allows an even more surprising transposition. Black calmly invites 3 d4 only to react very sharply: 3...cxd4 4 cxd4 d5. If then 5 e5 43c6 6 4k3 Jlg7 Black hopes to make good use of the open c8-h3 diagonal (e.g. by playing 7 4T3 Jlg4 !) and if 5 exd5 4T6 6 4k3 we suddenly find ourselves in a Panov At- tack Caro-Kann (see page 379). A third alternative, and one that may seem obvious to someone who has just studied 2 43c3 4k6 3 4)f3 e5, is to play 2...e5. The only differ- ence is that after 3 4)f3 43c6 4 Ac4 there is a pawn on c3 instead of a knight. Nevertheless, this is not a popular line for Black, perhaps be- cause the permanent threat of White playing d4 makes the position unusually tense.
396 FUNDAMENTAL CHESS OPENINGS
Finally, there is the less obvious but ex- tremely tricky 2...d6. waiting for White to play
3 d4 before lashing out with 3,..£tf6 (D).
2 c3 d5
2 ... d5 A logical reaction to 2 c3 since - unlike in the Scandinavian Defence (1 e4 d5; see page 465) - after the exchange on d5 White does not have the free developing move 5)c3 at his dis- posal. 3 exdS Qxd5 4 d4(D) Black seems to be asking for trouble here. First, what about 4 dxc5? Second, doesn't White simply achieve his strategic aim by just playing 4 jLd3? It is the first of these lines where most of the venom is hidden. For Black is not intending to meet 4 dxc5 meekly with 4...dxc5 5 Rxd8+ S'xdS hoping to be able to survive in a joyless endgame, nor is he intending to blunder a piece with 4...<21xe4?? 5 Ra4-t-. He intends to play the simple but very' surprising 4...Qc6. If White then defends his e-pawn with 5 f3 he is in for another surprise: 5...d5!?. Black ignores the c5-pawn and calmly continues to batter e4. His trump card is his lead in development, while the weak- ening of White's kingside (f3), however slight, may also make itself felt. After 6 exd5 Nxd5 7 Bc4 e6, for instance, there is the annoying threat of8...Qh4+. In practice, many players prefer 4 Jcd3. Black's main idea in that case is to intensify the attack against d4 by playing ...e5, either at once (4...c5) or at a later stage, perhaps after first fianchettoing his king's bishop with 4...cxd4 5 cxd4 g6 6 <Nc3 Jlg7. The bulk of these variations (and of 2...d5 and 2...4t3f6 theory as well) is fairly young. The Alapin Variation was really viewed as an innoc- uous little thing until about 1980 and theory is just beginning to come to terms with it. It has now been extensively analysed, however, so Si- cilian players need to be well prepared for 2 c3. In the multitude of variations starting from this position, the driving force behind all open- ing theory is clearly discernible: the never- ending search for good, better, best. For Black could be satisfied now with a sim- ple reply like 4...cxd4 5 cxd4 Nc6 6 4bf3 e6 7 Nc3 Rd6 8 J.c4 ?)f6 9 O-O Jle7, which gives him a perfectly reasonable version of a typical middlegame we have seen in many an earlier chapter: the isolated white pawn on d4 against a black pawn at e6. But chess-players are never satisfied with simple solutions and are always looking for belter, better still and belter again. And usually there is a good reason for this, for with a varia- tion like the above one. Black not only makes life easy for himself but for his opponent as well: White gets the chance to play al) his opti- mal developing moves for free. So any serious theoretical investigation of this position should start with an attempt to bring about the same type of position in a slightly more favourable version. For example: Black could play 4...53f6 5 Nf3 e6. delaying
SICILIAN DEFENCE 397
Bxc3 e4. In both cases Black is hoping to ob- tain the initiative. Another plausible method is to play ..Ag4 at some point, for instance 4...£\f65 Nf3Jlg4(D). ...cxd4 until White has developed at least one of his minor pieces in a sub-optimal way. i.e. less aggressively than in the above variation with
4...cxd4. This could be a move like Jtc2 or
?)bd2. And even Jle3 may be seen as a conces- sion on White's part, however small. In fact, this line constitutes one of Black's safest op- tions. After 6 Ae3 cxd4 7 cxd4 S)c6 8 Nc3 Qd6 the forthcoming middlegame is likely to develop along familiar lines: White has a space advantage and latent attacking chances on the kingside. Black has a wonderful square for his pieces at d5 and prospects of besieging White's d4-pawn. Apart from this classical treatment of the opening, theory has investigated a number of more aggressive options as well. In the first place. Black may want to eliminate all the cen- tre pawns and steer for a drawish position by playing 4...cxd45 cxd4 e5 (D). This line hinges on the 'threat' of exchang- ing pawns on d4 in the best possible circum- stances (and on White trying to avoid or even refute this). Positional assessments are often very delicate and controversial. A possible con- tinuation is 6 Jle2 e6 7 h3 ,h5 8 O-O Nc6 9 Jte3 cxd4 10 cxd4.

2 ... (D)
But this line has never been popular, possi- bly because the endgame after 6 Nf3 exd4 7 Qxd4 'S'xd4 8 Qxd4 is undeniably a little better for White (because of his tiny lead in develop- ment) or perhaps because for anyone who has the courage to play the Sicilian, a sudden switch to playing for a draw like this is just out of char- acter. A more popular version of this idea is to play
4...cxd45 cxd4 Nc66 f3 and only now 6...e5
(the same position is reached via 6...?)c6 in- stead of 6...exd4 in the previous variation). The idea is to meet 7 dxe5 with 7...Qxdl+ 8 &xdl Ng4 and 7 <Nc3 with 7...Jfb4 8 Ad2 Xxc3 9 A provocative move and, just like 2...d5, a pointed attempt at exposing the drawbacks of 2 c3. The first problem for White is that he cannot protect his e-pawn with 3 Nc3.

4 d4 White can also play 4 Nf3, delaying d4 until he feels it is the best moment for this advance. 4 ... cxd4 (D) in classical fashion by playing 7...d6 or he may want to play the more adventurous 7...f5. We now return to 5 ?)f3 (D):
B
5 ... <53c6 This is the crucial test of 5 Nf3. for with this move Black attempts to transpose into the 'old' main line as given above. For the same reason
5...d6 may also be played (6 Ji.c4 Nb6 7 3Lb3
Nc6 transposes to the 5...Nc6 line) but this is rather less popular, perhaps because of the al- ternative recapture 6 Qxd4 now being slightly more favourable than a move earlier. The alternative 5...e6 leads to a very differ- ent sort of game. This position (or rather the po- sition after 6 cxd4) is often reached via 2 ?If3 e6 3 c3 and is therefore quite important. White has consolidated his central pawn-formation. The advanced position of his e-pawn guaran- tees a spatial advantage and promises latent chances on the kingside, but the dominant posi- tion of Black's d5-knight makes it difficult to build up an actual attack. Two main lines have sprung up from this position: the classical 6...d6 and the modern 6...b6. If 6...d6 there are - roughly speaking - three possible schemes of development for White. One is 7 jLc4 and there is also 7 a3 followed by 8 -Nd3 (the immediate 7 4kd3 runs into 7...<$3b4), both placing the king's bishop on an attractive square. On c4 it puts pressure on Black's pow- erful knight, while on d3 it is pointed at h7, making many an opponent nervous at the pros- pect of castling kingside. The third and most radical option is to play 7 4bc3. At the cost of a Unlike the comparable Alekhine Defence (1 e4<?3f6; see page 447). here White's options for establishing a broad pawn-centre are rather limited. 5 <2)f3 This subtle move has gradually pushed the old main line, the obvious 5 cxd4, into the background. In many cases these moves trans- pose but there is one important difference. Af- ter 5 cxd4 d6 6 Nf3 "2hc6 White would like to play 7 Ac4. Black then has 7...e6 or 7...dxe5 to protect his d5-knight, but the critical move is the counterattack 7...4)b6. For many years the great debate in the 2...5hf6 variation was about the position arising after 8 i.b5 dxe5 9 4jxe5 .d7, but around 1980 the discussion died down. Solid defences were constructed against all attempts to obtain an opening advantage for White. A change of direction was needed and 5 4 3 became the new main line.
5 Rxd4 is also possible of course. This line
has a long-standing reputation of being safe but not overly aggressive. White changes his strategy: instead of aiming for a strong pawn- centre (which is what 2 c3 is all about) he goes for open files and diagonals and speedy piece development. The basic position of this line arises after 5...e6 6 <5)f3 <21c6 7 Qe4. Black can eliminate White's last remaining centre pawn
SICILIAN DEFENCE 399
weakening of his pawn-structure (after 7...Nxc3 8 bxc3 the c3-pawn will become a target), White eliminates the black knight.
6...b6 not only prepares ...Jtb7 but also opens
the way for a possible exchange of bishops with ... .a6 as well. In this case 7 £}c3 is the unchal- lenged main line. The position after 7...QBc3 8 bxc3 Qc7 9 Bd2 is critical. One important op- tion for Black is to start attacking White's e- pawn after all, with 9...d6 10 Nd3 <2ki7.
6 Nc4 (D)
This is the point of 5 5)f3. It is also the most aggressive move in this position. 6 cxd4 trans- poses back to the variations that White could have reached a move earlier by playing 5 cxd4. 7 ... d5 Secondly, White has to have an answer to this solid move. 8 exd6 This would also be the reply to 7...d6, 8 ... Rxd6 (D) This is the great starting point of this varia- tion. Most of the attention goes to 9 O-O. Taking on c3 is still not attractive for Black. After
9...dxc3 10 Sxd6 exd6 1 1 <2jxc3 he is lagging
behind in development while his extra pawn on d6 is just a flimsy little thing in any case. Black has a much more powerful move in 9...Be6, making use of the opportunity to eliminate White's dangerous b3-bishop. After 10 Bxe6 Rxe6 11 Nxd4 Q)xd4 1 2 Rxd4 White has got his pawn back but his lead in development has diminished. It is more aggressive to play 10 <23a3 and after 10...dxc3 to sacrifice another pawn with 1 1 Re2. The immediate 9 --<Ta3 is a variation on this theme. 9...Ae6 now has the obvious drawback of granting White a free developing move in the form of 10 <?3b5. The alternative is 9...dxc3, when again 10 lB'e2 is critical and very contro- versial indeed.

2 (D)
At all times, this approach has been consid- ered the most promising for White - as a refuta- tion of the Sicilian even, but that was a very long time ago. White intends to play 3 d4. 6 ... Nb6 Again, this counterattack is the theoretically critical reply. It is less aggressive, though cer- tainly not bad, to play 6...e6. when 7 cxd4 d6 transposes to the variation 5...e6 6 cxd4 d6 7 jLc4 as discussed above, with the (minimal) difference that Black has already committed himself to a ...Nc6 plan.
7 Ab3
The purpose of White's opening play be- comes clear. In contrast to the variation 5 cxd4 d6 6 Qf3 '-zic6 7 Jlc4 4)b6. he makes no attempt to take advantage of the pin against the c6-knight by playing Jtb5, but instead keeps his bishop aimed at the most vulnerable spot in Black's position: f7. This strategy involves first of all a pawn sacrifice, albeit one that is almost never accepted: 7...dxc3 8 £jxc.3, when White's lead in development is probably too threatening.
400 FUNDAMENTAL CHESS OPENINGS
opening the d-file and taking charge of the cen- tre, not with two pawns on e4 and d4 as in the Alapin but with a pawn and a knight and - most importantly - with beautiful open lines and nat- ural squares for all pieces. Looking at the posi- tion from this perspective, one might well bow and say 'thank you' to 1 ...c5 and look to the fu- ture with great confidence. But as I already described earlier in this chap- ter, it is precisely here, in this type of position, that the great transformation of the Sicilian De- fence has taken place. The compactness of Black's position, his flexible pawn-formation, the latent central pawn-majority (two pawns against one), the open c-file which forms the base for an amazing wealth of possible coun- terplay on the quecnside: these arc factors that may look inconspicuous at first sight but which will inexorably come to light when the position is examined more closely. Many an individual chess-player has gone through this learning pro- cess and so has the world of chess in its entirety. And precisely because White's prospects are so very different from Black's, the inherent ten- sion is enormous. A lot of self-confidence and confidence in one's position is required from both sides. In almost any 'Sicilian' position, one side is bound io think he has the advantage. In fact, very often both players will think so! And play will always be sharp: there simply is no other way to play the Sicilian. This makes the Sicilian an attractive but also very difficult opening. Il is also a highly complex opening with a multitude of variations, all with an idea, a name and a great body of theoretical knowl- edge of their own yet at the same time all very* similar to each other. Some variations are so closely interwoven that it is almost incompre- hensible why theory recommends move A in this line and move B in the other. In the position after 2 <?2tf3. Black faces a far- reaching decision. How should he anticipate the expected 3 d4? This decision will determine which variation eventually materializes, though some variations can be reached via several move-orders. And Black should not forget that although White is preparing to play 3 d4. he has not so far committed himself. So. however Black chooses to anticipate 3 d4, it must be compatible with his ideas of meeting alternative moves. Most of these are not quite so sharp as 3 d4, but some of them are not bad at all and have to be taken seri- ously. Black's major options are 2...<2)c6, 2...e6 and
2...d6. All the main lines of the Sicilian are in-
troduced with one of these moves and are based on play continuing 3 d4 cxd4 4 <2)xd4. All three of these moves offer White a specific choice of options. From the remaining nineteen legal moves in this position, there are three 'minor' options to be aware of: 2...g6, 2...a6 and 2...Qf6.
2...g6 is an alternative route to the Acceler-
ated Dragon (3 d4 cxd4 4 5jxd4 C c(i, or 4... jLg7 followed by 5...<23c6). By avoiding the far more popular 2...?)c6, Black steers clear of the Rosso- limo Variation (2...l21c6 3 jLb5), but he has to be prepared for some other lines, most notably 4 'Sfxd4 and 3 c3. The latter option is closely re- lated to the variation 2 c3 g6 (see page 395) and may easily transpose if play continues 3... .g7 4 d4 cxd4 5 cxd4 d5. The seemingly aimless little move 2...a6 has a most remarkable theoretical status. On the one hand it must be regarded (strange as it may sound) as the way of discouraging White from playing 3 d4. On the other hand, it is practically useless if White continues 3 c3. The idea is to meet 3 d4 with 3...cxd4 4 lR3xd4 Q>f6 5 Nc3 e5, what you could call an 'improved' Najdorf Vari- ation ('improved' because unlike in the Najdorf proper, Black can still develop his king's bishop at c5 or b4). The problem is that White in his
SICILIAN DEFENCE 401
be met by 11...O-O 12 Hdl Be6. On the other hand, White now has an easy way of protect- ing f2, namely 10 Qe4+ Ne6 1 1 Rh4. This variation hinges on the question of whether af- ter I l...Bxd6 Black has enough compensation for the missing pawn. turn may play an 'improved' Alapin Variation with 3 c3, when ...a6 comes suspiciously close to being just a loss of tempo. is a highly provocative move that strikes a balance between 2 c3 42Uf6 and the Alekhine Defence (1 e4 <R2>f6). It is called the Nimzowitsch Variation. Compared to the Ale- khine Defence, this line has the advantage of not allowing White to form a broad pawn-centre after 3 e5 z?3d5 thanks to the pawn on c5. But 4 '53c3 shows up the drawback: 4...'53xc3 5 dxc3 is now better for White than the comparable line in the Alekhine ( 1 e4 <2 f6 2 e5 <5kl5 3 Nc3 Qxc3 4 dxc3; see page 448), thanks to... the c5-pawn, which makes the liberating move ...d6 decidedly less attractive. After 5...d6 6 exd6 exd6 Black has only saddled himself with a weak pawn while giving his opponent full con- trol over d5. For this reason it is not 4...Nxc3 but 4...e6 which takes us to the basic position of the Nimzowitsch Variation, which arises after 5 xd5 exd5 6 d4 (D):
2 Nf3 <Sc6
2 ... <2k6 (D) Of all the possible moves at Black's disposal, this one is perhaps the most natural. Black de- velops a piece and prepares 3...4)f6, as yet without committing himself to any particular pawn-formation. But looking more deeply into the problem and looking ahead at the position after 3 d4 cxd4 4 £jxd4, we have to be a little more criti- cal. No matter how flexible Black's pawn- phalanx may be. certain main lines of the Sicil- ian are already beyond his reach. 2...Nc6 is not a neutral move, as none of Black's second- move options are. Anyone playing 2...£}c6 does so (or so one would hope) with some par- ticular main line in mind. 3 d4 Naturally, White can play anything he likes here, but there is one move that truly deserves to be called the king of the minor variations: 3 JlbS (I)), the Rossolimo Variation. This move is popular at all lex els with players who have no wish to expose themselves to the breakneck pace of the main lines (3 d4). White continues developing his kingside and only then White is threatening to win a pawn with 7 dxc5 jtxc5 8 Rxd5. Black's answer to this problem is both simple and bold: he takes no notice of the threat and continues 6... 3c6. sac- rificing a pawn in return for fast development. After 7 dxc5 J.xc5 8 Qxd5, 8."Bb6 leaves White no easy way of protecting f2. but he does have a dangerous way of not defending it: 9 i.c4! Axf2+ 10 S&e2 O-O 11 Sfl. Most players prefer not to test this variation and play 8...d6. opening another diagonal before lashing out: 9 exd6 'fe? b6, when 10 Jlc4 .xf2+ 1 1 Ne2 can

planning to continue with c3 and d4. or 5 c.3 a6
6 Jia4 b5 7 Bc2 with the same idea. But this
line has also become infiltrated with the new idea of 4 Axc6 and this is a fully accepted option nowadays. After 4...bxc6 5 d.3 €le7 (now with ...4)g6 in mind) the bold 6 4)g5 is often played, freeing the way for f4. Perhaps as a reaction against these popular 4 akxc6 lines, 3...d6 (D) has recently come to the fore. does he plan to undertake any sort of action in the centre. Depending on Black's reply, this may either be aggressive with d4 (possibly prefaced by c3) or very calm, with d3 for instance. The la- tent 'threat' of J.xc6 adds a certain positional tension to the game, wliich not every Sicilian player will be happy with. For one thing, it is not always easy to decide whether taking on c6 is actually a good idea. It is also very often com- pletely unclear whether Black should recapture with his b- or his d-pawn. The exchange on c6 is most certainly the central theme of the Rosso- limo Variation. After Black's most popular reply 3...g6, there is a major division of minds. The classical ap- proach is to play 4 O-O and after 4.. , .g7 to con- tinue either with 5 c3 or the more flexible 5 Sei, but nowadays 4 Jkxc6 is a very popular al- ternative. If then 4...bxc6 White continues in classical fashion with 5 O-O Jtg7 6 c3 followed by d4. If 4...dxc6 on the other hand (when the open d-file makes this plan less promising for White), a simple yet dangerous alternative plan has emerged, consisting in 5 d3 Jlg7 6 h3 <2hf6 7 ?)c3 O-O 8 jLc.3 followed by 9 Rd2, -4.h6 and possibly even O-O-O. The same division occurs if Black plays
3...e6, preparing ...Nge7 and then ...a6 (thus
actually encouraging White to take on c6!). At first this variation revolved around the question of whether after 4 O-O Nge7 White should im- mediately open the centre (with 5 Eel a6 6 Bxc6 Nxc6 7 d4 cxd4 8 5hxd4 for instance), banking on his lead in development, or whether he should play 6 Ji.fl (instead of 6 Jtxc6), At first this move looks illogical, for Black is actually pinning his own knight, but the idea is to prepare the harmonious unpinning move
4...jLd7. This line is also relevant to the variation
2...d6 3 Bb5+, where interest in 3...Nc6 has
grown considerably of late. After 4 Jlxc6+ bxc6
5 O-O Black has two possibilities of hindering
the crucial advance d4: 5...e5 and 5...Ng4. Al- though these are interesting enough lines, most players have so far preferred the classical 4 O-O in this case. After 4..Jkd7 5 Eel Black then has to decide whether he will risk the loss of tempo involved in playing 5...a6, unafraid of 6 Jlxc6 Bxc6 7 d4 cxd4 8 Nxd4 (analogous to the variation 3...e64 O-O jge7 5 2el a6, given above) or whether he will first develop another piece with 5...Clf6. waiting for White to spend a tempo himself on 6 c3. In the latter case,
6...a6 forces White to take a similarly funda-
mental decision. For some time the pawn sac- rifice 7 ±xc6 Jcxc6 8 d4 was all the rage, but then the excitement died down and White started playing the more restrained 7 Jkfl, with Black usually replying 7...Jtg4, again
SICILIAN DEFENCE 403
with the idea of hindering White's plan of playing d4. From White's remaining options of avoiding the main lines, the following deserve at least a brief mention: 3 c3 is neither better nor worse than 2 c3 and often transposes; 3 d3 has a simi- lar degree of compatibility with 2 d3; and 3 4t)c3 is a popular way of avoiding a Sveshnikov Variation - 1 have classified this a subvariation of 2 Nc3 in this book (see page 394). If White wants to play a c4 set-up, he should have done so a move earlier, for now 3 c4 leaves White's f3-knight blocking the vital advance f4 in case Black replies 3...e5. 3 ... cxd4
4 Nxd4 (D)
Four Knights Variation, but is mainly used as a cunning route to the Sveshnikov. More resolute than these two little pawn moves (but also more compromising) is the powerful thrust 5...e5. For a long time this was called the Pelikan Variation, but is generally known nowadays as the Sveshnikov Variation (even if Sveshnikov himself has called it the Cheliabinsk Variation). Black immediately fixes the pawn-formation in the centre. Moreover, he does so in a way which at first sight looks rather dubious. Once upon a time this was regarded as a clumsy minor variation and in fact it was not really understood until the 1970s. Now it has conquered the world, for this is one of the most important variations of the Sicilian Defence. Finally there is 5...Qb6. which leads, after 6 S)b3, to a position that will be briefly discussed in the short paragraph on 4...Rb6 below. One set-up that is conspicuously absent from this list is the idea of a kingside fianchetto. Any- one having this formation in mind is likely to concentrate on the Dragon Variation (2...d6 3 d4 cxd4 4 '<lxd4 <2)f6 5 <2)c3 g6). Of course, there arc ways of combining the development of the king's bishop at g7 with 2... c6, but Black has to be careful here. In fact, the oldest variation based on this theme was 4...<Nf6 5 Nc3 g6, but this is hardly ever played nowadays because White has the annoying 6 4)xc6, when both
6...dxc6 7 Rxd8+ 'fi'xdS 8 Ac4 and 6...bxc6 7 c5
5)g8 8 Bc4 are unattractive for Black. There is, however, a fully viable successor to this 'Prime- val Dragon': 4...g6. the Accelerated Dragon. Another way of developing the king's bishop is via the a.3-f8 diagonal. This plan was first im- plemented in the Four Knights Variation, but a subtle variation on this idea is to play 4...e6 (without the preliminary 4...4)f6 5 $Jc3). This is the Taimanov Variation. Since this variation is closely related to the Paulsen (or Kan) Variation (2...e6 3 d4 cxd4 4 4Bxd4 a6) and is in any case more often reached via 2...c6 in practice, I have chosen to include it in the section on 2...e6. These are the variations that we shall go into a little deeper. There are three other moves for Black which have also made their mark, but which cannot really be included with the main lines. I shall just outline them very briefly: This position is one of three main gates to the heart of the Sicilian Defence (the others are the analogous positions with 2...d6 and
2...e6 instead of 2...Nc6). Now, what options
does Black have? The first move that comes to mind is the sturdy 4...Nf6. This leads, after the natural reply
5 Nc3 (5 "Nxc6 bxc6 6 e5?? fails to 6...Qa5+).
to a position where Black again has several op- tions. 5...d6 (this position is also reached by
2...d6 3 d4 cxd4 4 <2>xd4 Nf6 5 Nc3 5te6) is the
starting point of the Classical Variation, al- though its main lines have different names (the Richter-Rauzer and Sozin Attacks) by which they are better known. The use of names for these lines is somewhat vague in any case, for S...e6, a variation that may also be reached via 2...e6. is known as the
404 FUNDAMENTAL CHESS OPENINGS
The first is 4...Qc7, This is in fact a paradox- ical way of aiming for the Taimanov Variation, which now arises if White replies 5 <2te3, as Black then plays 5...e6. The idea is to make the aggressive 5 4bb5 less attractive for White by... inviting it. The point becomes clear in the posi- tion after 5...'Qb8: Black is not faced with the threat of Nd6+ (as he would be after 4...e6 5 5?Bb5) so he does not have to play ...d6, closing the diagonal for his king's bishop. Should White continue 6 c4, Black can play 6...<$31'6 7 N5c3 and now 7...e6 or 7...b6 8 Be2 Bb7 9 O-O e6. He has retained the option of playing ... ,c5 or ...aLb4. while in some cases even ...d5 is possi- ble.
4...1B'b6 is also one of those elusive varia-
tions which are played, accepted and written about in theoretical manuals, but without ever becoming a truly main line. Black chases the knight away from its dominant position on d4 at the price of a loss of tempo (for ...Rc7 will in due course be inevitable). This usually leads to a Scheveningen-type position, for instance after 5 <5Ab3 ~Nf6 6 ?3c3 (this position can also be reached via 4..,Nf6 5 2)c3 Rb6 6 Nb3)
6...e6 7 jLe3 Qc7. The aggressive plan of play-
ing f4 and Rf3 followed by the advance g4-g5 is critical. Finally, there is 4...e5. a variation on the theme of the Sveshnikov. Remarkably, this is both one of the oldest and the youngest varia- tions of the Sicilian. The old (but not old-fashioned) interpreta- tion is to meet 5 b5 with 5...a6 (D), an ap- proach based on tactical ideas. At first sight, the many holes in Black's pawn-chain after 6 4hd6+ Ji,xd6 7 Qxd6 look truly horrendous but these are compensated for (to a certain extent at least) by Black's lead in development after 7...Rf6. If 8 'Nf6 Nxf6 9 3c3, the liberating 9...d5 becomes possible (10 exd5 53b4 wins back the pawn), while 9...Nb4 seems to be playable as well. Things become rather more complicated if While avoids the ex- change of queens. After 8 Qdl Qg6 9 Qtc3 Nge7, for instance, the advance ...d5 is again hovering over the position. The modem approach is purely positional:
5...d6 (D).
This line is of interest to players who are looking for the typical middlegame of a Svesh- nikov Variation but without having to acquire the enormous theoretical knowledge which this variation nowadays demands from its devotees. If 6 ?)lc3 a6 (6...Nf6 transposes to the 'real' Sveshnikov) 7 ?3a3 b5 8 Nd5. instead of play- ing (which again transposes to the Sveshnikov proper after 9 Jlg5) Black may try
8...<Nge7 or even 8...Nce7.
6 c4 is a critical test of this line. White
strengthens his grip on d5 and prevents ...b5. Nevertheless, there are quite a number of play- ers who like to play this position as Black. The most important point in Black's favour is the manoeuvre ...Be7-g5, activating or exchanging his 'bad' bishop. 6,..Be7 7 Nlc3 a6 8 <2)a3 Be6
9 Jie2 Ag5 is a likely continuation. This varia-
tion leads to a strategic rather than a tactical battle.
SlC/L/AN DEFENCE 405
those days it was thought to be essential for Black to make either the advance ...b5 or the manoeuvre ...4)a5(e5)-c4, in order to obtain active play on the quccnside. Until then, an early Jfe3 was usually played, but by delaying this move (thus avoiding 8 Be3 a6 9 a4 Qc7 10 <2)b3 1 1 f4 <2Bc4 - with an attack against the e3-bishop! - for instance) Maroczy frus- trated this plan. Such was the impression his treatment of the opening created, that the ...e6 plan was named after Scheveningen (which is really odd considering it was given a thorough beating there!) and - more importantly perhaps - that it disappeared into the background, until it was rehabilitated many years later (see page 427).
6...g6 became the new main line and this
plan held up very well for many years, which - in hindsight - is not so strange because, as we shall see on page 445, the Be2 plan is not ex- actly the sharpest way to treat a Dragon. Then in the 1940s another weapon was added to Black's arsenal: 6...e5 (D), the Boleslavsky Variation. Classical variation 4 ... Nf6 In the early decades of the 20th century, the heyday of austere classical chess, this position was the starting point of the Sicilian. What was investigated was whether this opening could stand up to the then modem, strictly positional dogmas, as contrasted with the old-fashioned, highly tactically coloured opening variations of the 19th century (like the variation 4...e5 5 ?}b5 a6 that we have just seen). That this -later called the Classical - variation was accepted is under- standable. Black is playing healthy - classical - developing moves and avoids compromising his position in any way. And even though the world of chess, together with the Sicilian, has changed beyond recognition since those days, the Classi- cal Sicilian remains one of the soundest and most important interpretations of this opening. Now, how should we look at this position? The first, almost self-evident, main line was 6 Be2. Theoretical debate started with the ques- tion of whether Black should then reply 6...e6, the Scheveningen Variation, or 6...g6, the Dragon Variation. In the early 20th century, 6...e6 was the most popular choice, until in a tournament at the Dutch town of Scheveningen in 1923, the Hungarian grandmaster Geza Maroczy beat the future world champion Max Euwe in a very impressive game that continued 7 O-O Ae7 8 *hl O-O 9 f4 Qc7 10 Nb3 a6 1 1 a4.

That Black could afford to create a hole in his pawn-chain at d5 without any visible concrete compensa- tion to show for it was a revolutionary discov- ery in (hose days, one which left many traces in other variations of the Sicilian, for instance in the Najdorf.

4t)b5 is disastrous for Black, while 7...gxf6 8 <RAf5 is an inferior version of what we now call a Sveshnikov Variation because the vital advance ...f5 has been prevented. This means that by playing 6 Ag5 White more or less forces his opponent into a ...e6 plan (although there are in fact a few alterna- tives, like 6...Jld7. for instance, anticipating 7 Rd2, when Black intends to create swift coun- terplay on the queenside with 7...2c8 8 O-O-O Qxd4 9 Qxd4 Qa5). 6 ... c6 But after this move, more complicated prob- lems arise and the first doubts as to the strength of 6 Bg5 begin to creep in. Is g5 really such a good square for the bishop if Black neutralizes the pin against his knight so easily by playing ,.Be7? Were White to continue indifferently, with 7 Ae2 Ji.e7 8 O-O O-O for example, perhaps the bishop would rather stand on e3, for 9 f4?? is now very bad on account of 9...Qb6.
7 Qd2 (D)
By playing this move, White lays his cards on the table: he intends to castle queenside. This has two concrete advantages: the kingside is kept free for attacking operations, and Black's d6-pawn comes under pressure. So halfway through the 20th century things were looking rather good for Black. But then the tide turned. It was becoming obvious that White needed something more incisive than 6 ,Ne2, something that would restrict Black in his freedom of movement. Very' slowly, assessments of 'Sicilian' positions began to change. From being based on general and somewhat rigid po- sitional ideas, they became more concrete, pay- ing more attention to the exact characteristics of each and every position. Variations became more precise, more dynamic, more daring. The old move 6 Bc2 did not completely disappear (for there is nothing wrong with it) but it was no longer seen as a real test of the Classical Sicilian. Two new variations emerged, which pushed
6 Be2 aside: 6 JLgS, the Richter-Rauzer At-
tack, and 6 -fcc4, the Sozin Attack. We shall take a closer look at them. Richter-Rauzer Attack 6 -lg5 (D) This is often called simply the Rauzer At- tack. reflecting the fact that the modem han- dling of this line, with Rd2 and O-O-O, was devised by Vsevolod Rauzer. The fact that 6 -£-g5 is more aggressive and forcing than 6 Ji.e2 can be felt immediately:
6...g6?! is far less attractive now that White
has the reply 7 Bxf6 to ruin Black's pawn- structure. White is also much better armed to counter Boleslavsky's move, for if now 6...e5?l then after 7 Nxf6, 7... 'xf6? 8 -<Bd5 'S'd8? 9 A great number of methods has been devel- oped for Black to come to terms with the prob- lems of this position. In the first place. Black has to find an answer to moves like Ndb5 and f4, especially in combination with e5 and Jlxf6. Exchanging on f6 is an important theme in the Richter-Rauzer Attack. In many cases it is very

By playing 9 Jle3 White simply accepts that his bishop has had to retreat. After 9...Ad7 or
9...Jte7, he will concentrate his attention on
gaining space on the kingside with 10 f3 fol- lowed by g4.
9 Jlf4, on the other hand, attacks d6 and
forces Black to defend rather ingeniously with
9... .d7 (9...e5? fails to 10 xc6 bxc6 11
.xe5), indirectly protecting the d-pawn for af- ter 10 €Bxc6 Axc6 White's e-pawn is attacked and 1 1 f3 can be met by 1 l...d5. Both these lines are well investigated and lead to a sharp fight. A popular alternative is to play 8...aLd7, when

difficult to evaluate the resulting position when Black takes back with his g-pawn (which is of- ten forced). This results in a complex type of position, which is fairly unique to the Richter- Rauzer. Black's kingside pawn-formation is somewhat rigid and White may well try to at- tack it by playing f4-f5. On the other hand, the doubled f-pawns give Black greater control over the centre and he has the pair of bishops, two factors that may be to his advantage in the long run, for instance if he manages to play ...d5. Some players are very fond of this pawn- structure. others are allergic to it and others again allow it only if they consider the circum- stances to be truly favourable. For instance, only the real die-hard ...gxf6 fan will go for this type of position immediately by playing 7...h6 8 .*,xf6 gxf6 (if 8...Qxf6? 9 €fdb5 'SW8 10 O-O-O Black simply loses his d- pawn). It is not that there is a concrete problem with this - in fact, after 9 O-O-O a6 10 f4 Jid7 the position strongly resembles a main line that we are about to see - but the 'moderate' ...gxf6 player simply does not like to give the tempo ...h6 away for free. Far more usual is 7...a6, a useful move pre- venting ?Mb5 and preparing ...b5 (in the long run). After the consistent reply 8 O-O-O (D), Black has several options: If then 9...h6, the retreat 10 jlh4 is OK since
10...Nxe4 can be met stoically with 11 Qel,
which promises White a dangerous initiative after 1 1 ...£tf6 12 €)f5. But the real point of
9...h6 is to play 10..,g51?, a spectacular way of
breaking the pin on the f6-knight. Now the boot is on the other foot, for after 1 1 fxg5 QJg4 it is White's g5-pawn that is pinned, making it diffi- cult for White to consolidate his extra pawn. In the meantime Black has obtained a beautiful square for his knight al e5. This too is a contro- versial and fascinating variation that is hotly debated. But Black may also choose simply to con- tinue developing his pieces and play 9...Ji.e7 (instead of 9...h6). After 10 Nf3 b5 there is again a parting of the ways. White has the sharp 1 1 e5 (to which 1 1 ...b4 is the recommended re- ply) and the positional 1 1 Jlxf6, when 1 1...gxf6
8...h6 really makes sense now, for taking on
f6 is not a problem for Black now that he can simply recapture with the queen. Nor is 9 Ah4 Qxe4! very promising for White. The main lines therefore are 9 lie 3 and 9 Jlf4.
408 FUNDAMENTAL CHESS OPENINGS
brings about that typical Richter-Rauzer pawn- formation again. 12 15 Rb6 13 g3 O-O-O is a characteristic follow-up. White could start put- ting e6 under pressure with a manoeuvre like Ah 3 and <2)e2-f4, but he has to be careful all the time not to allow his opponent to take over the initiative by playing ...d5.
9...B5 10 Axf6 gxf'6 is another way of bring-
ing about this typical Richter-Rauzer pawn- formation. The alternative recapture, 10...Rxf6, is not quite impossible here, bur it is rather risky because of 1 1 e5! dxe5 12 £jdxb5, attacking d7. Black may also try to do without ...a6. for the time being at least. In fact, the simple 7...Ae7 8 O-O-O O-O is both the oldest and the most classi- cal of Black's options. The Achilles' Heel of this line is d6 of course, but it turns out not to be easy for White actually to take advantage of the vulnerability of this little pawn. If 9 •5''.db5. for instance, 9...Ra5! 10 Axf6 Axf6 1 1 Nxd6 Zd8 is a strong reply. The powerful f6-bishop and the nasty pin on the d-file arc sufficient com- pensation for the pawn. The main lines start with 9 <?2"b3 and 9 f4. 9 <5)b3 is a more subtle version of 9 £tdb5. While introducing the possibility of playing Axf6, White does not commit himself. He also prepares an assault against Black's king with f3 and g4. Black has a defence against these threats in 9...Qb6 10 f3 (if 10 Jcxf6 Axf6 11 ; xd6 Black can restore the materia) balance by tak- ing on f2) 10...Zd8, covering d6 and introduc- ing the counter-threat of ...d5. Other moves that have been tried include 9...a5 (to meet 10 Jl.xf6 with a pawn sacrifice: 10...Axf6 11 Rxd6 'RFxd6
12 Bxd6 a4 followed by 13...a3) and 9...a6 (to
counter 10 Axf6 'simply' with J0...gxf6). Against 9 14 (D) Black again has several op- tions. First there is the radical attempt to transform the situation in the centre by means of the sur- prising counterattack ...e5. The most subtle ver- sion of this plan starts with 9...h6. If White now plays 10 Jtxf6, the idea is to sacrifice a pawn with 10...Axf6. Both 11 Nxc6 bxc6 12 >xd6 Rb6 and 11 41db5 e5! (with the nasty point 12 1'5?? Ag5) offer Black sufficient counterplay. The critical variation is 10 Jl.h4. which allows both 10...'<Bxc4 (when White is satisfied with a

slightly better endgame: 11 Bxe7 -5?xd2 12 JlxdS <Rjxfl 13 <2)xc6 bxc6 14 jlel Ne8 15 Zhxfl Bxe7 16 Exd6) and - more importantly - 10...e5. After 1 1 Nf5 Jlxf5 12 exf5 exf4 the point of the inclusion of 9...h6 is revealed: White cannot recapture on f4 with the bishop. If 13 Rxf4 instead, Black has the bold reply
13...<15 since 14 Axf6? Bxf6 15 "5)xd5 (again)
loses the queen to 15...Ag5. A second main line is 9...£txd4 10 Qxd4 Ra5. Just to illustrate in how much detail this line has been analysed: if White chooses the healthy developing move 11 J.c4, there is no need for Black to reply with the timid ll...Sd8. He can play the unperturbed developing move 1 l...Jtd7 instead, for 12 e5 is met by 12...dxe5 13 fxe5 A.c'6, when 14 cxf6 runs into 14...Rxg5+. If 14 Ad2 Nd7 15 Nd5, Black defends with
15...Qd8 16 £fxe7+ Qxc7. In the resulting
position. White has attacking chances against Black's king but Black's pieces are well-placed and his position is without obvious weaknesses. Sozin Attack

arc no such tactical objections to 6...e5?l but the positional drawbacks of this move as com- pared to 6 Ae2 e5 are clear enough: the white bishop is perfectly placed on c4. where it is aimed at the crucial squares d5 and f7.
SICILIAN DEFENCE 409
Nevertheless, until the 1950s 6 3kc4 was not a popular move. The reason for this was that c4 was not thought to be a good square for White's bishop after Black's most natural reply: 6 ... e6 (D) Nowadays the aggressive 6...Q'b6 is consid- ered as much of a test of 6 .acc4 as this quiet pawn move. In fact, this is probably the best of the many ... b6 variations that lie hidden in various comers of the Sicilian, since after chas- ing away White's knight there is the further prospect of chasing the bishop as well. After 7 Nb3 e6 8 Ne3 Rc7 9 Ad3, for instance, White has lost a full tempo on the 4...Rb6 variation that I gave on page 404. White really has to play imaginatively here. After 7 ?)b3 e6, for exam- ple. both 8 Af4 and 8 Ag5 have been tried (in- stead of the perhaps slightly too routine 8 Jte3) and an even more subtle idea is to play 7 <5)db5, planning to meet 7...a6 with 8 Ne3 Ra5 9 Nd4. The resolute 7 53xc6 bxc6 8 O-O is also quite log- ical. White makes no attempt to attack Black's queen but simply develops his pieces as fast as he can. In the position after 6...e6, White has to jus- tify his previous move, for if he plays without a clear plan Black will have plenty of ways to lake advantage of the position of the bishop on c4: ...41a5, ...a6 and ...b5, ...-'S'c7, ...d5 and even the combination ...'?3xe4 (with the idea that af- ter 53xe4 there is the fork ...d5, winning back a piece on either e4 or c4). The great breakthrough of the Sozin Attack came in the 1950s when it was discovered that advancing the f-pawn by f4-f5 constitutes a sound and aggressive plan for White. This will attack c6 and if that pawn can be removed (by forcing Black to respond with ...exf5 or ...e5) White obtains a strong square at d5. Also, the alternative advance e5 (supported by f4 of course) can be quite dangerous. This plan be- came so popular that it infiltrated the Najdorf and Scheveningen Variations as well (as we shall see further on in this chapter). A few de- cades later, an even more aggressive plan by the Yugoslav grandmaster Velimirovic gave the Sozin another impulse.

Any attempt to say some- thing sensible about this could only fail misera- bly so I shall remain silent, but this variation does give an idea of what it takes to play the Velimirovic Attack.

Summing up: while being tailor-made for the diligent student, preparing his openings to perfection in the quiet of his study, the Velim- irovic Attack is a pure kamikaze mission for one who goes about it unthinkingly. There are countless alternatives for Black on any of his previous moves, but this is the most important and also the most controversial basic position of the Velimirovic Attack. White still has the option of playing f4 in combination with either f5 or e5, but - now that his king is safely tucked away on the queenside - the far more ambitious g4-g5 is a dangerous option. 10 ... Qc7 This is Black's main move here. White now has a choice between 11 g4 and 11 2hgl. The immediate 11 g4 commits White to re- capture on d4 with the rook, for after 11... 3xd4, While loses a pawn if he plays 12 Axd4 e5. However, the position of the white rook after 12 3xd4 is not as had as it looks. There is, for in- stance. the prospect of a surprising switch to the kingside: 12...b5 13 g5 <S3d7 and now 14 Qh5 with ideas of e5 and Sh4, while 14 f4 is another dangerous option. Nonetheless, the preparatory move 1 1 Shgl is at least as important. After the further 1 l...hS

cautious 11...4)d7 12 g4 <?k5. Black is walking into a minefield. The reply 13 l21f5!?, for in- stance, is already considered commonplace. White 'simply' intends to open the g-file after

for his knight on d5. In fact, some hugely com- plex variations are only about to begin from this point! If Black 'calmly' replies 13...b5. he has to be aware of the spectacular continuation 14 Four Knights Variation 4 ... Nf6 5 <2te3 e6 (D) This line, which also arises via 2...e6, is older than the Classical Variation.

White has to act vigorously. The obvious way of doing so is to try to find a way to take advantage of Black's principal weakness: the d6-square. The first move that comes to mind is 6 4bdb5
(D).
If Black does not make an effort here, White will play c4, chasing the knight away from d5 and obtaining a firm grasp on the centre. How- ever, Black has several ways of trying to exploit his small lead in development. His most popu- lar option is the subtle 8,..Qc7 9 f4 Rb6, when
10 c4 allows both 10...4Ne3 and 10...Ab4+.
This leads to sharp play, as is obvious from the fact that the main line of the latter variation starts with 11 's?e2 f5. Black then has two options, the first being
6...Bb4, which in its turn provokes two very
different responses from White. In the first place, there is the ultra-sharp 7 Af4, with the position after 7...€Bxe4 8 Rf3 (or 8 €k7+ <Nf8 9 W3)8...d59 c7+*f8 100-O-O ±xc3 1 1 bxc3 as the crucial starting point. Secondly, there is the far more restrained 7 a3, with the position after 7"Jlxc3+ 8 Nxc3 d5! 9 exd5 exd5 10
[diagram]
Black has taken advantage of the exchange on c3 to advance his d-pawn to a dominant posi- tion. This line is very old, yet still highly topi- cal, for neither the mysteries of 7 aLf4 nor the positional problems of 7 a3 have been solved. But the Four Knights Variation can also be used as a means of entering the Sveshnikov Variation. After 6...d6 7 uLf4 e5 8 Ag5 the same position is reached as after 5...e5 6 5idb5 d6 7 .g5. This move-order is popular with players who prefer to avoid side- variations like
5...e5 6 db5 d6 7 <2sd5 or who do not want to
run into a Rossolimo Variation (2...£te6 3 Bb5). For this purpose, 2...e6 and the Four Knights Variation is the obvious shortcut. But no shortcut is ever without its own little problems! Ever since the 1970s, 6 Nxc6 has been a prominent alternative to 6 Ndb5. The Sveshnikov Variation We have seen quite a lot of this opening by now, but it is only with this move that we are

comparable version 4,..e5 5 R3b5 ah 6 6+ i.xd6 7 S'xd6 Qf6. Only the subtle 6...h6, to prevent Ng5, is sporadically played. 7 _ &g 5 This aggressive and natural move looks com- pletely self-evident. White develops a minor piece, strengthens his grip on d5 and introduces the threat of ±xf6, forcing Black to take back with the g-pawn, thus seemingly ruining his pawn-structure even further. But anyone taking a closer look at this variation will soon find out that such an evaluation is completely outdated. In fact the whole underlying point of the Svesh- nikov is that doubled f-pawns are not a liability here, quite the contrary: they are a dangerous weapon! To what extent this judgement is correct is of course the central question of the Sveshnikov. But in view of the complexity of this problem and the fact that the rather optimistic manoeuvre Jig5xf6 often backfires, it is not surprising that alternatives have also been seriously investi- gated. The most important of these is 7 d5, a move that is in every respect the exact opposite of 7 Bg5. White uses his control over d5 only to bring about a radical change in the pawn- formation. After 7...Nxd5 8 exd5 he is bank- ing on his queenside pawn-majority to be of more importance than Black's central advan- tage: 8...Qb8 9 c4 Jie7 10 Ji.d3 a6 1 1 #)c3 O-O
12 O-O f5 is a characteristic continuation.
The alternative 7 a4 is mainly an attempt to exorcise the hidden evil powers of the Svesh- nikov. After 7...a6 8 Na3, the advance ...b5 is prevented and there is the positionally attrac- tive prospect of playing £te4-e3, when White will have a firm grip on d5. The downside of this plan is that there is very little immediate danger for Black, who has plenty of opportunity to develop his pieces actively and comfortably himself, for instance with 8...jLe6 followed by
9...Sc8 and perhaps ...£kl4.
7 ... a6 (D) 8 <2)33 In the early years of the Sveshnikov (the 1970s). 8 .Nxf6 was often played in order to force Black to recapture with the g-pawn. But to- day this move has all but disappeared because: finally entering the Sicilian of the 21st cen- tury. Long considered a fossil from the early 20th century, it was not until the 1970s that this move really started to attract attention owing to the stubborn attempts of the young Russian Evgeny Sveshnikov to turn it into a playable opening system. Influenced by his incessant analytical and practical efforts (and successes too!), around 1975 all former scepticism was swept aside and the Sveshnikov suddenly be- came all the rage. Everyone who was young in those days and not inhibited by dogma (or expe- rience) threw themselves headlong into this new opening system that so very wonderfully (and mercilessly) flew in the face of 'old-fashioned' thinking. And that was only the beginning! For in the 1990s a generation appeared for whom the Sveshnikov was not something acquired or foreign. They were steeped in it ever since they were bom. Players for whom nothing was more natural then to play the Sicilian in precisely this way began taking over the world of chess. To- day, early in the 21st century, the Sveshnikov Variation is one of the most influential open- ings in the elite tournaments. It has become one of the great battlegrounds where world champi- ons and their challengers meet. This enormous popularity is the result of the sheer inexhaustible resilience of Black's posi- tion. Although the Sveshnikov can hardly be called solid, it is most certainly a variation where Black faces no greater dangers and is taking no greater risks than in many other lines of the Sicilian, while his chances of victory are unusually high. Experience of over thirty years now suggests that the harder White hits, the harder Black hits back. And yet White has to play sharply, for if he doesn't he has no pros- pect of obtaining any sort of opening advantage whatsoever.

9...b5 (which transposes), but also the immedi-
ate 9...f5 and even the amazing 9...d5!?, which - by the way - had been known long before the days of Sveshnikov and which is why the whole variation is still called the Pelikan in conserva- tive circles. 8 ... b5 Without the preceding exchange of pieces on f6, there is far less point to 8...d5. since after 9 Nxd5 (if 9 exd5 Black has 9..Bxa3 10 bxa3 'Sia5) 9....Nxa3 10 bxa3 Ra5+ White now has 1 1 Nd2 as well as 1 1 Rd2 Rxd2+ 12 Nxd2. in both cases taking advantage of his bishop not having been exchanged on f6.

It seemed unbelievable at first that Black, having already played ...e5, can really afford to throw in 8...b5 as well, literally forcing White to occupy this splendid square at d5 that Black has gifted to him. Besides, there are a number of seductive options to try to pun- ish ...b5 outright (like a piece sacrifice on b5, or c4 after White has played d5). It is the great merit of Evgeny Sveshnikov to have demon- strated that Black can survive all these on- slaughts and even come out on top sometimes! It turned out that Black's aggressive queenside advance is exactly what his position needs. White's king's knight is trapped at a3 and in many positions (especially if White plays c3 at a later stage) ...b4 is an excellent way of starting an attack on the queenside. There are two main lines. The oldest, sharp- est and still the most critical option is 9 Ji.xf6, while the more cautious alternative is 9 Nd5.

but not the best of moves before 10..Jtg7, be- cause of 1O...£je7?? 11 <21xf6#! The critical test of 10...Ji.g7 probably starts with 11 Ad3 <Ne7 12 Nxe7 Rxe7. Now 13 c4 allows Black to highlight a characteristic aspect of this line: far from meekly playing 13...bxc4 (making 14 £3xc4 a wonderful present for White's knight) he strikes back at once with
13...1'5!. If 14 cxb5 there is another surprise in
store for White: 14...d51. The critical line is 14 O-O O-O and now, for instance, 15 Qf3 bxc4 16 43xc4 d5 17 exd5 e4 18 Qe3 Xb7. The immediate 11 c4 also meets with a sharp reply: 1 l...f5 12 cxb5 <2kl4 with a highly explo- sive position. A plan based on 11 c3 is more cautious. This leads, after 1 1 ...f5 12 exf5 Axf5, to a position that we shall come across later via 10...1'5, when it arises following 1 1 exf5 jLxl'5 12 c3 Jcg7 or 1 1 c3 Ng7 12 exf5 Axf5. We now return to 10...I5 (D): The great transformation in positional think- ing that was needed for the Sveshnikov to be understood and accepted was that taking back on f6 with the pawn was not an admission of weakness. Once it was seen that having two f- pawns to serve as battering-rams against White's central formation adds enormous power and dynamism to Black's position, the tide was ready to turn. In some variations. Black even makes use of the open g-file as an attacking base against White's king. That his own king's position is rather airy, to say the least, has hardly appeared noticeable in practice. The more conventional recapture 9...Qxf6?! only shows up the drawbacks of 8...b5: by play- ing 10 €)d5 Qd8 1 1 c4 White immediately opens fire against Black's queenside. If H...b4 White has the powerful blow 12Qa4!; e.g., 12... ,d7?! (12...bxa3? 13 Qxc6+ jld7 loses a rook to 14 Rxa8! Qxa8 15 <21c7+) 13 Nb5!, based on the same tactical point: 13...axb5 I4Qxa8!. 10 2)d5 (D) Starting from this position, a wealth of varia- tions has been developed over the past 35 years or so. First, there was the simple and unceremoni- ous attempt to 'bash him flat' with 11 Jlxb5 axb5 12 )xb5. Black cannot reply 12.,.Ra5+
13 c3 Rxb5?? because of 14 Nc7+, so he must
either return material with 12...fia7 or allow a white knight into the heart of his position at c7. The spectacular 12...fia4 is generally regarded as the critical test of this idea. So far Black has been able to survive the resulting complica- tions, which are almost unfathomable. 10 ... f5 The classical move, if that word is appropri- ate for a variation as young and unclassical as the Sveshnikov, but since about 1985 10...Bg7 has shown itself to be a reliable alternative. The advance ...f5 is only postponed, not cancelled, and by developing the bishop first. Black de- fuses any sacrifices on b5 that White may have hadinmind. If 11 Jlxb5?axb5 12 xb5, for in- stance, Black brings his king into safety by sim- ply castling. Moreover, Black can now play ,.. e7, an important manoeuvre strategically,
SICILIAN DEFENCE 415
The alternative piece sacrifice. 11 '<)xb5 axb5
12 Ji.xb5, has never been anywhere near as
popular as II Bxb5. Still, after 12...Bd7 (or
12... .b7) 13 exf5 White has three pawns for
the piece, so the material balance is not really disturbed. White's chances lie not so much in a direct attack against the enemy king, but in a (hoped-for) long-term positional domination. Those who do not feel tempted by either of these sacrifices will want to concentrate on the strategic problem of how best to resolve the central tension. The simplest way of doing so is II exf5, when Black will reply H..Bxf5. In the early years of the Sveshnikov. this position was (again) seen mainly as an opportunity for White to refute the whole line with the sharp 12 Rf3. But unlike 1 1 jlxb5, this line disappeared very quickly when it was found that 12...QJd4! 13 2)c7+ Rxc7 14 Rxa8+ *e7 15 c3 b4! 16 cxb4 Qb6 gives Black the most wonderful com- pensation for the exchange. After that, attention finally turned to a more cautious approach and the solid 12 c3 became important. White in- tends to regroup his knight with <2)c2-e3/b4. This leads, after 12...Ag7, to a position that also arises via the surprising 11 c3. This move is actually based on a trap: if H...fxe4?, then the sacrifice 12 Bxb51 axb5 13 %3xb5 is much more convincing than on the previous move. After the more solid ll..Jkg7 12 exf5 .xf5 (D) we arrive at the critical position: he has consolidated the position of his d5-knight and all of his remaining pieces are well-placed. Yet he is facing two intimidating pawns at e5 and 1'5, either of which might move forward at any moment with unforeseeable consequences. The consequences of White most popular choice, 11 .a.d3, are even more difficult to eval- uate. This move strikes a balance between the savage piece sacrifices on b5 and the simple 1 1 cxf5. While making a sound developing move. White leaves it to the opponent to resolve the tension in the centre. The immediate exchange 1 l...fxe4 12 jLxe4 is unattractive, for this gives White an improved version of the 1 1 exf5 line, but after a few preparatory moves, taking on e4 in combination with ...15 may well become a positional threat. The critical position arises af- ter 1 l..Be6 (D), intensifying the central ten- sion even further. By taking aim at the d5-kmght, Black not only prevents 12 exf5, but he also introduces the possibility of taking on <15, causing a change of scene whose consequences are very difficult to assess. In the early days of the Sveshnikov, when players on the white side were still working on the assumption that they only had to make a few intimidating moves and Black's position would collapse of its own account, 12 Qh5 ±g7 1 3 c3 O-O was usually played. This offers White the chance to play 14 exf5, for after 14..Jlxd5 15 f6, mate is threatened at h7 and Black is forced to return the piece. In fact, the position which then arises after 15...e4 16 fxg7 2e8 is still 13 £te2 O-O 14 QJce3 Ne6 15 i.d3 f5 is a characteristic continuation. White has prospects of taking the initiative on the queenside with a4,

topical today, but Black has been holding his own comfortably for well over thirty years now. Another important type of position arises if play continues 14 O-O f4. After 15 Hfdl Sb8 16 €Bc2 Qd7, for instance, it is very difficult (but essential!) to evaluate properly the conse- quences of moves like ...f5 or ...Ji.xd5. In later years 12...5g8 (instead of 12..J"Lg7) also turned out to be eminently playable, albeit equally hard to judge. Another plan that has been an important weapon in White's arsenal right from the start, yet without ever causing the Sveshnikov to be refuted, is to attack the queenside with c4. One version of this idea is to play 12 O-O Bg7 13 Qh5 f4 14 c4. But more recently a whole new face was given to this line by the introduction of a new idea: instead of 12..Bg7, taking on d5 also turns out to be perfectly playable. In fact 1 2... .xd5 13 exd5 3e7 is now one of the most hotly contested subvariations of the Sveshnikov.

9 Nd5(D)
calms down a little, but providing Black is ac- quainted with a few basic strategic concepts, he has little to worry about. 9 ... Ne7 (D)
9...Qa5+ is a remarkable way of inviting the
opponent to repeat moves: 10 Nd2 'S'dS 11 J&gS Ra5+. This invitation is in fact fairly often accepted, though probably more from subjec- tive (han objective reasons. If White wants more than a short draw, he has a choice be- tween the sharp 1 1 c4 and the quiet 1 1 #Jxf6+ Qxf6 12 Xd3.
10 Nxf6
10 Nxe7 is also not without venom. It looks
illogical to exchange the wonderful knight on d5 for Black's passive bishop, but the point is to retain the bishop which is well-placed on g5.
10...Nxe7 is the most popular reply, indirectly
attacking the e4-pawn. If 1 1 Nd3. Black re- news the threat with 1 l...Ab7. while after 1 1 jlxf6 gxf6 we again have the explosive pawn- formation of the 9 4.xf6 line. The sharp 12 c4 Ji.b7 13 cxb5 Bxe4 is a characteristic follow- up. 10 ... Nxf6 It would be a mistake to recapture with the pawn (compare 8...Jte7). As we have had ev- ery opportunity to sec, in this type of position Black's king's bishop belongs at g7.
11 c3 (D)
This is the basic position of the 9 <5Ad5 vari- ation. White intends to manoeuvre his a3- knight to e3 or b4 ( c2-e3/b4) and is likely to play a4 at some point, taking the initiative on By playing this move. White is trying to pac- ify the dark forces that seem to materialize inex- plicably from Black's choice of the Sveshnikov Variation. White wants to keep the position sim- ple and controllable, reducing the prospect of immense complications to a small, but tangible positional advantage. But the Sveshnikov would not have become the super- variation it is today if this plan worked. It is true that play usually

11...O-O 1 2 £k2 Bg5 ( this is a drawback of the
Jlxf6 plan: Black's otherwise rather passive bishop finds the opencl-h6 diagonal) 13 a4. If Black were now to react somewhat sheepishly with 13...Sb8 14 axb5 axb5. he would simply be handing White another beautiful square for his knights at b4 and he will be tied down to the defence of b5. It is far better to play 1 3...bxa4 14 3xa4 a5. While still has a beautiful knight on d5 but Black has prospects of counterplay, both on the queenside (with ...3b8) and on the kingside(with ...f5, possibly prefaced by ...g6). Accelerated Dragon 4 ... g6 (D) The name Accelerated Dragon sounds odd, but becomes understandable when viewed in its historical context. As I described in the intro- duction to the Classical Variation (see page 405), a century or so ago 4...5')f6 5 53c3 d6 6 Be2 g6 was the standard way of playing a ...g6 set-up. When everybody started to play 6 Jlg5 or 6 Ac4 in order to make 6...g6 unattractive, many ...g6 devotees began looking for alterna- tive ways of bringing about their favourite type of position. Since4...£jf6 5 Nc3 g6 is not really an option (see page 403), it is only logical to go back another move and play 4...g6 and to call this the Accelerated Dragon. It was not until much later that the move-order 2...d6 3 d4 cxd4
4 Nxd4 <2>f6 5 'Sc3 g6 became popular. This
even became the most popular way of fian- chettoine the king's bishop. It also claimed the But the Accelerated Dragon is by no means an obsolete variation. After 5 c3 Black may ei- ther 'return' to the Dragon Variation proper or play an independent variation. It is mainly 5 c4 that has been considered the critical test of 4...g6 ever since its introduction. White strengthens his grip on the centre and steers the game in a totally different direction. In fact this line, which has been named after Geza Maroczy (1870-1951 ), is much closer strategically to the English Opening than to most lines of the Sicilian Defence. 5 c3 5 £}c3 Bg7 6 i.e3 Nf6 Black is not afraid of the aggressive 7 <Sxc6 bxc6 8 e5. He can either sacrifice a pawn for the initiative (and open files) with 8...<2)d5 9 Nxd5 cxd5 10 Rxd5 Sb8 or he can start an attack against e5 with 8...Ng8 9 f4 f6. 7 .e,c4 (D) What makes this variation attractive to many players is the multitude of treacherous tactical explosives which lie hidden in this position. White has to be very careful indeed if he is to avoid stepping on these little mines, especially if he is bent on transposing to a main-line Dragon. Unfortunately there is no easy way of circumventing them (that is to say: not from the stern and lofty point of view of opening theory), since 7 Jle2 O-O 8 O-O d6 leads only to
418 FUNDAMENTAL CHESS OPENINGS
•5)xe4 (although it is actually not at all clear who profits from this exchange). If White radi- cally prevents the advance of the a-pawn with 9 a4, then 9...Ng4 10 Rxg4 <2)xd4 is much more powerful than on the previous move because a future ...Nxb3 will now have to be met by cxb3, weakening White's queenside pawn-structure. But the most surprising aspect of 8...a5 becomes visible if White plays the subtle 9 f3, for in that case Black finally lashes out with 9...d5, radi- cally opening the position. 10 exd5 is countered with 10... 4 1 1 Ndc2a4 12Nxa4<2Mxd5 and
10 Ji.xd5 <23xd5 11 exd5 with 1 1 ...?3b4 12
Qdc2 Jlf5 13 2d b5. In both cases Black ob- tains the initiative although it is really hard to make out whether this is sufficient compensa- tion for the sacrificed pawn. Another tricky fea- ture of Black's idea is highlighted after 10 .xd5 <2)xd5 1 1 4jxd5 (and not the other way round: after 10 xd5 Nxd5 1 1 .xd5?? <2)xd4
12 Jtxd4 Jlxd4 13 ?xd4 e6 White loses a
piece) 1 l...f5, undermining White's centre from the other flank. Finally there is 7...Qa5 (D). a fairly innocuous subvariation of the Dragon (see page 445). Besides, Black has the aggres- sive (and highly characteristic) alternative idea
8...d5!?.
In this position there are two moves which leave White guessing whether Black is intend- ing to transpose to a regular Dragon, and one move which immediately gives the variation a character of its own. By playing 7...d6. Black introduces the threat of 8...Ng4. Now, if White is keen on playing a main-line Dragon, 8 f3 is indicated (the alterna- tive is to play 8 h3, but this transposes to a less critical line of the Dragon after 8...O-O; see page 445). If then 8...O-O we do indeed have a Yugo- slav Attack, but Black also has the double-edged option of 8...Rb6!?. This was a hotly-contested variation in the 1960s. Black is not only threat- ening 9...Rxb2, but 9...i5)xe4 and 9...Ng4 as well. One of the critical lines is 9 45f5 Qxb2 10 Nxg7+ Qf8 11 Nd5 21xd5 12 Nxd5 *xg7. Black has won a pawn but White has taken over the initiative. Later 7...O-O became the most common move. Again White has to be careful: 8 f3 Qb6 is even more tricky now than in case of 7...d6 8 f3, and
8 Rd2 is simply bad because of 8...i?Jg4. So if
White wants to retain the possibility of a main- line Dragon he has to play 8 J_b3. This works after 8,..d6 9 f3, but there are a few sharp alter- natives to 8...d6. based on the knight jump ...Ng4 and the bold central advance ...d5. The most popular version is to start with 8...a5, in- tending to meet 9 O-O with 9...a4 10 21xa4 This move forces White to castle kingside, for both 8...4bxe4 and 8...Qg4 are nasty threats (for example: 8 f3 l'b4 9 Ab3 <£}xe41). The only difference from what I have described above as "a less critical line of the Dragon" (7...d6 8 h3) is that Black has already commit- ted himself to a ...Ra5 set-up (which - to com- plicate things even further - is actually not bad and even the preferred choice of quite a few players in the 7...d6 8 h3 variation!). The critical
SICILIAN DEFENCE 419
lines start with 8 O-O O-O and then either 9 <2ft>3 '>c7 10 f4 d6 1 1 i.e2 or 9 ±b3 d6 10 h.3 jhl7 1 1 f4. but this does not automatically make every ex- change of pieces a good thing. In this position, for instance, playing 5...?lxd4 6 Rxd4 would be quite silly. The h8-rook is attacked and 6...<2}f6 is strongly met with 7 e5. What is good though, is to play 5...23f6 first and to take on d4 only after White has replied 6 23c3. After 6...23xd4 7 ' xd4 d6 all doors are bolted and Black has the pleasant prospect of playing 8...Jlg7 and
9...O-O, possibly followed by a juicy knight
move attacking White's queen on d4. Even more subtle (and more popular too) is to play 6...d6 instead of 6...£jxd4. This move- order makes it impossible for White to choose the aggressive set-up of 6...Nxd4 7 Qxd4 d6 8 J.g5 Bg7 9 Rd2 followed by aLd3 (for after
6...d6 7 jig5 Black switches to 7...Bg7 - instead
of taking on d4 - when White's d4-knight, left without the 'natural' support of his e3-bishop, comes under heavy pressure). An important starting point of this line arises after 6...d6 7 Ne2 23xd4 8 Qxd4 Ng7. If 9 Ne3, for instance, Black's standard development is 9...O-O 10 Rd2 jLe6 1 1 Ecl Ra5 12 f3 Efc8 1 3 b3 a6, which is both efficient and aggressive. If 14 O-O the ad- vance 14...b5 will be possible. White's best chance according to theory is now to initiate ex- changes himself with either 14 <53d5 or (more subtly) 14 <2)a4. After 14 23a4 Rxd2+ 15 Sxd2 23d7 Black retains possibilities of active play though, either with ...b5 or with ...f5.
6 Jke3
White can avoid the exchange on d4 by re- treating the knight: 6 Nc2 or 6 <2)b3. Apart from the loss of tempo, this also leaves White slightly more vulnerable on the al-h8 diagonal, yet in principle this is a sound idea, especially if White chooses 6 Nc2. He is in fact playing the Rubinstein Variation of the Symmetrical Eng- lish (see page 203) with colours reversed. 6 ... Nf6
7 Nc3(D)
Again, the central (positional) issue is find- ing the right way of exchanging pieces. At first the surprising knight sortie 7...<2)g4 was thought to be Black's best option. The critical position arises after 8 Rxg4 <21xd4 9 Wdl. Black can consolidate his knight on d4 at the cost of his pawn-structure by playing 9...e5, but he also Maroczy Bind
5 c4 (D)
For most players who are considering play- ing the Accelerated Dragon, this move will be the touchstone. A very specific (and rather un- Sicilian-like) type of position arises which not every player will feel comfortable with. Black's pawn-chain is strong and solid, but he has rela- tively little space for his pieces. He will have to attack White's central formation so as not to drift into a passive position. This requires not only a good strategic understanding of the situ- ation but also a keen eye for every incidental tactical opportunity that might happen to come his way. For While, the situation is very much the same. If he wants to be successful with a Mar- oczy Bind, patience and positional understand- ing are of the greatest importance, but he must also keep his eyes open for every even remotely possible attempt by his opponent to break the siege. 5 ... Bg7 This natural move seems self-evident at first sight, yet there is a major alternative showing how' predominant positional considerations are in this line. As a rule, the side that has less space (and consequently less manoeuvring room for his pieces) is well advised to exchange pieces
420 FUNDAMENTAL CHESS OPENINGS
has the much more solid O.-. eb (or 9...<?3c6). After 9...Nc6 10 Bel, Black can play 10...b6 1 1 Bd3 Jlb7 12 O-O O-O, for instance, when the advance ...f5 becomes crucial. Another charac- teristic plan is to play 10...Ra5 11 Rd2 b6 12 Ad3 4Bb7 13 O-O g5, trying to gain control over the dark squares. Starting in the 1980s, the simple developing move 7...O-O became a popular alternative. This approach had long been considered too passive but on closer inspection this turns out not to be a problem at all. After 8 ,e2 d6 9 O-O Black has
9...Nxd4 10 Bxd4 aLd7 (or 9..Bd7 immedi-
ately) with the idea of putting the bishop on c6, where it keeps e4 under pressure. This is often followed up with ...<2}d7-c5, for instance 1 1 Rd2 .c6 12 f3 #3d7. Black does not have to fear the exchange of his king's bishop in this position since 13 4Lxg7 S'xg? leaves White rather vulnerable on the light squares. 2 "3f3 e6 2 ... e6 (D) In the 19th century, when the Sicilian De- fence was only beginning to be taken seriously, this was the normal reply to 2 Qf3. With the rise of 2...<21c6 and what was later to become the Classical Variation, 2...e6 faded into the back- ground, but it is only natural that this did not last very long, since 2...e6 is a healthy move which fits perfectly into the 'modem' Sicilian as well. 3 d4 One of the advantages of 2...e6 is that there are no obvious alternatives to playing 3 d4 cxd4 4 xd4. On the other hand, some of the 'stan- dard options' are slightly more attractive - or perhaps we should say the timing is slightly better for them - now that Black has limited his range of possible replies, having already com- mitted himself to a set-up with ...e6. For instance, playing 3 d3 (D) here is the most popular way to reach the King's Indian Attack against the Sicilian Defence. After 3...d5 4 <?3bd2 a position arises that we have seen in the French Defence (see page 348). A more 'Sicilian' reply would be to play
3... c6 4 g3 g6 5 Ng2 i.g7 6 O-O Qge7. The-
ory regards 7 c3 O-O 8 d4 as the most critical test of this set-up. This is the same switch to Plan B that we have seen in the paragraph on 2 d3 al the start of this chapter (see page 390). Similarly, Black now has fewer options against 3 c3 than he has against 2 c3. But there are some problems with this. If Black replies
SICILIAN DEFENCE 421
3...£}f6, his choice of responses to 4 e5 <2)d5 5
d4 cxd4 6 cxd4 is indeed limited compared to 2 c3 5)f6 (see page 398) and the same can be said about 3...d5 4 exd5 Rxd5 5 d4 as compared to 2 c3 d5. But if Black chooses 4...exd5 instead of
4...Rxd5 in the latter variation, he is no worse
off than after 2 c3 c6 3 d4 d5 4 exd5 exd5. And the most complicated problem arises if White tries to improve on this line by playing 4 c5 (in- stead of 4 exd5), hoping for a transposition to the Advance Variation of the French (4...Nc6 5 d4), for Black has an ambitious alternative frus- trating this plan: 4...d4. The position arising after 3 ?k3 has been discussed in the coverage of 2 43c3 e6 3 £}f3 (page 392).
[diagram]
f6, we arrive at a position that we have seen in the chapter on the Symmetrical English, where it arises via 1 c4 c5 2 Nf3 'Skb 3 4k3 4tf6 4 c4 e6 (see page 208). Oddly enough, the straight- forward follow-up 5 d4 cxd4 6 Nxd4 takes us back into Sicilian territory, albeit an innocuous subvariation of the Taimanov (see page 422). In fact, the only way to turn 2,..e6 into a truly independent variation (without playing 3 d4 and within the limits of what opening theory finds acceptable) is to play 3 b3. While tries to take advantage of 2...e6 in so far as the most logical reply to a b3 idea, a set-up with ...e5 to close the diagonal of the bishop that is about to appear at b2, is (more or less) ruled out now. But this variation is still in an experimental phase and theory has little to say on it. 3 ... cxd4 4 >xd4 (D) This position offers a very different range of options from the analogous situation after
2...4.6, but there are some points of contact.
For instance, 4...Nc6 introduces the Tai- manov Variation, which can also arise after
2...Nc6. On the other hand, 4,..a6, the Paulsen
(or Kan) Variation, although very closely re- lated to the Taimanov, is exclusive to 2...c6. Another transposition to a 2...£jc6 line is offered by 4...'2)f6. when after 5 £te3 the Four Knights Variation (which I have included in the 2../2)c6 section) is only one move away:
5...<53c6.
But one of the most important of all varia- tions based on ...e6, perhaps even the most im- portant and perhaps even the backbone of the entire Sicilian Defence, is the Scheveningen Variation, that arises after 5...d6 (D). Not only is this a fundamental position (also accessible via 2...d6) in itself, but the whole Si- cilian is literally steeped in shortcuts, secret paths and straightforward transpositions to one of the innumerable subvariations of this open- ing system. It is only a very slight exaggeration to say that whoever does not know the Schev- eningen does not know the Sicilian Defence. The Taimanov, the Paulsen and the Schev- eningen are the great main lines in this position. There are also a few smaller variations, among which one is especially notable because it lies on the very edge of what is possible, both positionally and tactically: 4... f6 5 Nc3 Bb4 (D), the Pin Variation.
422 FUNDAMENTAL CHESS OPENINGS
Black is aiming for the complicated position after 6 c5 Nd5 7 ±d2 Nxc3 8 bxc3 Ae7. White's queenside pawn-structure has been heavily damaged and Black can look to the fu- ture with confidence - if he makes it to the future! For in the meantime White has a lead in development, a space advantage and the initia- tive. 9 Qg4 is critical and in particular the ex- change sacrifice 9...O-O 10 ,$.h6 g6. This is very much a variation 'for devotees only', but it can be most rewarding to give it a try, for most play- ers on the white side are unlikely to be armed to the teeth for it.
4...'Qb6 is one of the youngest variations in
the Sicilian and practically unknown before
1990. The idea is to meet 5 <2hc3 with 5...Nc5,
attacking the knight. 5 Nb3 is rather more solid and is likely to transpose - after 5... 3c6 6 Nc3 Nf6 - to a position we know from the variation
2...QJc6 3 d4 cxd4 4 ?)xd4 Rb6. There is plenty
of room for new developments here. A perhaps more plausible version of the same idea is to play 4...jlc5, in order to meet 5 <2hc3 with 5...Qb6. This line is very old, but has been rediscovered by opening theory only very re- cently. The basic idea is known from the line of the Paulsen where Black plays 4...a6 5 jkd.3 Jlc5 (see page 426).

are prospects of opening a frontal attack against White's centre with either ...d5 or ...f5. Taimanov Variation 4 ... Nc6 ( D ) This subtle variation came into fashion during the 1960s and has remained very popular ever since. It is a great favourite with positionally- oriented players who see it as a means of escap- ing the ultra-sharp and deeply-analysed com- plexes of variations of the Najdorf and the Sveshnikov (for instance), without being shal- low or boring (if it were possible to find such a line in the Sicilian!). The christening of this line is rather vague. The Taimanov evolved from the much older Paulsen Variation and is often confused with it. Remarkably, Mark Taimanov himself, the Rus- sian grandmaster who was the most responsible for the upsurge of this variation, spoke of 'my variation' only in those cases where Black de- velops his king's knight via e7! 5 " Nc3 The fundamental thesis of the Taimanov Variation (and of the Paulsen) is that Black con- siders it unnecessary to provoke 5 Nc3 by play- ing 4...$)f6, because he is not afraid of the most plausible alternative to 5 <2)c3, a set-up with c4 (as we have seen in the Accelerated Dragon). Whether this is correct is still an open question. It is true that the straightforward 5 c4 is fairly harmless for this allows Black to retaliate im- mediately with 5... hf6 6 4)c.3 (6 '?'Bxc6 bxc6 7 e5?? fails to 7...Qa5+) 6...Bb4. But White also has the preparatory move 5 4)b5, analogous to the Four Knights Variation, with the idea of playing 6 c4 only after Black has played 5...d6. closing the diagonal for his king's bishop. Eval- uating this type of position, which we have come to know in the chapters on the English
SICILIAN DEFENCE 423
Opening as the Hedgehog System, is difficult and in any case very much a matter of taste. There are some players who will never play the Taimanov because of this line and there are others who feel perfectly at home in it. In any case, White has made a concession to reach this type of position for he has had to play Nb5 and he will have to 'lose' another move to get his knight into safety again (which is why hardly anyone ever plays 4...d6, giving White 5 c4 'for free'). The most important starting position of this line arises after 5...d6 6 c4 431'6 7 <21lc3 a6 8 <R3a3 J.e7 9 ±e2 O-O 10 O-O b6 11 ±e3 lb7 (D). much of an impact at this stage, Black keeps them in reserve. Instead he chooses a piece de- ployment which leaves the opponent guessing where Black's king's bishop is going to reside (it might even go to d6 in some cases!), while all the time a 'simple' ...d6 remains a possibil- ity. In fact, this is one of those cases where the Scheveningen Variation is sort of secretly pres- ent in the background of another variation. At any moment it might become visible, but even when it does not, it is still leaving its mark on the actual course of the opening. The ideal Taimanov player is someone who knows ex- actly which of the many Scheveningen subvari- ations he wants to play and who is a master of all weapons of the Taimanov. Nevertheless, the immediate 5...d6 is a per- fectly viable alternative. This is regarded as a re- liable way of avoiding the dangerous Keres Attack (4...<2)f6 5 cS d6 6 g4). but ever since White started to play 6 g4 even without a knight on f6, this shortcut has no longer been such a safe option. By playing 5... c7, Black prepares 6...Nf6 (the immediate 5...4jf6 transposes to the Four Knights Variation). An alternative is to play
5...a6. introducing the possibility of a quick
...b5 and preparing the delicate manoeuvre ...2ige7 followed by ...?3xd4 and ...Nc6 (the immediate 5,..43ge7?! would run into 6 4)db5). A characteristic variation is 6 Jce2 &Sge7 7 Jl,e3 <2)xd4 8 Qxd4 b5 9 O-O £k6 10 Qd2 Ae7 (D). White has a spatial advantage, but Black's position is not only very' solid, but also offers prospects of eventually lashing out with ...b5 or ...d5. It might be useful to study this variation in connection with the Hedgehog System of the Symmetrical English (see page 216). White has an alternative in 6 Jcf4 (instead of 6 c4), a move we know from the Four Knights and the Sveshnikov Variations. The difference is that now after 6...e5 White cannot play 7 Jtg5 and has to drop the bishop back to e3 first (7 .e3) before 7...Nf6 8 Bg5 becomes possi- ble. Now that White has had to invest an extra tempo (Jle3-g5 instead of Ag5 directly), this idea loses some of its bite. 5 ... Rc7 Here we get a first indication of the finesse and elasticity which characterize this variation. The a3-f8 diagonal is open, which means that Black could play 5...Jlb4 or 5...Jlc5. But since neither of these aggressive moves would have By eliminating White's d4-knight, Black has considerably reduced the pressure on his
424 FUNDAMENTAL CHESS OPENINGS
f4?? because of 8...Qxd4 9 Qxd4 Ac5. The logical preparation for this move is to play 8 Jte3. Black then has 8...Jle7 9 f4 d6, transpos- ing to the Scheveningen Variation, or he can play the much sharper 8...Jtb4. The conse- quences of the latter move (inviting White, for instance, to play 9 <Na4 with the idea of contin- uing 10 <2)xc6 and 1 1 Qb6) have been the sub- ject of thorough analysis for almost half a century by now. Another option is to give the e-pawn some ex- tra support. The oldest method of doing so is 6 g3 a6 7 jlg2. This has the added advantage of making a direct transposition to the Schevenin- gen Variation not quite the perfect solution for Black, since, unlike against 6 .e2, a set-up with ...a6 and ...Rc7 is not considered one of Black's very best options against g3 in the Scheveningen (nor is it one of the very worst, to be honest). The critical response is the typical Taimanov idea of playing 7...<2)f6 8 O-O Nxd4 9 Qxd4 alc5. Black then continues ...d6, perhaps followed by ...e5. White has a slight lead in development, but Black's position is basically sound. Another way to protect e4 is 6 Ji.e3 a6 7 jld3

position, but having omitted the 'usual' attack against e4, he has also left White free to de- velop as he pleases. Black has a clear plan of action on the queenside with moves like ...Bb7, ...Sc8, ...<c7 and ...Na5-c4. White may want to make use of the weak point in Black's pawn- chain at d6, for instance by playing Jcf4-d6. Illustrative of the relatively great room for original manoeuvring Black has in this line is the variation 7 O-O (instead of 7 Jle3) 7...Nxd4

natic devotees of this plan who take on c6 a move earlier, yet this has never had the sanction of opening theory. But with Black having al- ready played ...a6 - in this context a fairly use- less move - <2)xc6 suddenly becomes more attractive. We now return to 5...Rc7 (D): After 5...#c7, taking on c6 (6Nxc6) is again relatively harmless because (unlike ...a6) ...Qc7 is a useful move in this type of position. Nor is 6 <Ndb5 Rb8 a major worry, though the sharp 7 Ac 3 a6 8 Jlb6 requires an accurate response. Therefore. White normally just develops his pieces.

ening 9... hg4), but his most popular option is

...b5 and ...jLb7. Black is developing his queen- side before his kingside in order to take the ini- tiative on that wing as soon as possible. But the 21st century has brought changes to this respectable variation. Following the suc- cess of the English Attack against the Najdorf Variation, the idea of playing 6 Jte3 a6 7 'B'd2 has also penetrated the Taimanov. White in- tends to castle queenside and wipe Black out on the kingside with a pawn-storm: f3 and g4, 'etc.'. This raw and aggressive approach has shown itself to be a severe test for the delicate touch of many a Taimanov specialist. 7...411'6 8 O-O-O Jlb4 seems a plausible reaction (threat- ening 9...4)xe4), but how to proceed after 9 f3 is far less obvious. Black has tried 9...4)e5,
9...41a5 and 9...4)e7, all with the idea of mak-
ing the prospect of ...Jlxc3 more intimidating, sometimes in combination with ...d5. Theory of this line gets rewritten almost every day. Paulsen Variation 4 ... a6 (D) bishop. In many cases he will first play ...Rc7 and ...b5 followed by ...Jlb7. This flexibility appeals to the players who like to play the opening not overtly aggressively, but ready to pounce on his opponent if given the chance. One might call the Paulsen Variation the fore- runner of the Hedgehog System that has been briefly mentioned in this chapter as part of the Taimanov Variation and is especially relevant to the Symmetrical English. Since Black is playing in such reserved fash- ion, White can play just about anything he likes. But in this jungle of possibilities, a few main lines are clearly discernible nevertheless: 5 4)c3 and 5 Jld3. The principled 5 c4 is also of importance but, although better than against the Taimanov, this advance is still not considered ail that danger- ous for Black. After 5...43f6 6 4)c3 the straight- forward 6...Bb4 7 ±d3 2)c6 used to be thought critical, although many players prefer 6...Rc7 these days. The latter move prevents 7 e5 and (again) leaves White guessing as to his oppo- nent's intentions. Depending on White's reply, Black will either play ...,Nb4 (against 7 Be2 for instance), or ...Jlc5 (against 7 Ad3), but in some cases he may delay such bishop moves even further and first develop his queenside with ...b6 and ...A.b7 (for instance if White plays 7 a3).
5 Nc3
5 Nc3 (D)
With this healthy and uncomplicated devel- oping move, a position is reached that arises also via 2 4)c3 e6 3 4)f3 a6 4 d4 cxd4 5 4)xd4 (see page 392) or via 2 4)f3 e6 3 4}c3, etc. Black has at his disposal 5...4k6 to trans- pose to the Taimanov Variation or 5...d6 to transpose to the Scheveningen, but the real Paulsen moves are the ultra-flexible 5...Qc7 and the immediate queenside advance 5...1)5. By playing 5...Rc7 Black controls e5 and silently increases the pressure along the c-file. A transposition to either the Taimanov (with ...41c6) or the Scheveningen Variation (with ...d6) remains possible, but there are many in- dependent lines. If 6 Ne2, for instance, the The Paulsen (or Kan) Variation was the main line of the Sicilian Defence in the 19th century, which makes it the oldest 'living' interpretation of this opening. Il is the invention of Louis Paulsen (1833-91), who has been called the ar- chitect of the Sicilian Defence. Naturally, open- ing theory has come a long way since those days, but the Paulsen Variation has remained highly topical. Black docs not yet commit him- self to a square for his knights nor for his Icing's
426 FUNDAMENTAL CHESS OPENINGS
that of playing c4, open. This implies that Black no longer has any 'easy' transpositions to the Taimanov or the Schcveningen. 5 Js.d3 detaches the Paulsen Variation from the complicated web of ...e6 systems and is therefore the only real attempt to show up its downside.
B
advance 6...b5 7 O-O J_b7 is slightly more inci- sive than on the previous move (5...b5) since with the bishop on e2, White's e-pawn is some- what more vulnerable. If 6 g3 it is mainly
6...Bb4 that should concern White. If 6 Bd3, a
transposition to the Taimanov with 6... c6 7 .Ne3 (see page 424) is Black's most popular choice. Black does not have to worry about 7 'Sixcb dxc6 in this case (compare 5 Ji.d3 4)c6 6 4)xc6 dxc6 below) since the white knight is not optimally placed at c3 for this pawn-for- mation.
5...b5 is the most straightforward version of
a plan that is available to Black in almost any position of the Paulsen or the Taimanov Varia- tion. Black prepares to attack White's e4-pawn with ...Ab7 and ...b4. Protecting e4 with 6 Bd3 is White's most plausible reply. A critical posi- tion arises if Black then continues 6...Qb6 7 Ne3 ,Nc5. Around 2000 it was discovered that this may lead to the most amazing complica- tions if White plays the unbelievable 8 Rg4!? Axd4 9 e5!. The point is 9...Axe3 10 Qxg7 Ji.xf2+ 1 1 Nf1, when, despite being two pieces up, Black's position is in grave danger of col- lapse. Oddly enough, however, this has inspired players on the black side to come up with a ver- itable arsenal of weapons to try to show up the drawbacks of 5 Jcd3. At first these were aimed at the now unprotected position of White's knight on d4. The simplest ways of doing so are 5... 3c6 and 5...Ac5, The critical test of 5...'21c6 is to take on c6: 6 xcb. White is optimally placed to counter
6...bxc6 because after 7 O-O d5 he can attack
Black's centre with 8 c4. On the other hand, the situation is relatively favourable for Black to play 6...dxc6, because (unlike in the Taimanov Variation with 5 <2k3 a6 6 Nxc6) there is no queen exchange on d8 to destabilize the posi- tion of his king. Black is likely to play ...e5, when the symmetrical pawn-formation and the absence of immediate tactical problems demand a subtle positional understanding from both players.
5...Jic5 used to be played in combination
with 6 5Bb3 jLa7, when White's standard plan is to exchange Black's king's bishop. Theoreti- cal discussions concentrated on variations like
7 Re2 'Sic6 8 Jle3 Jkxe3 9 Rxe3 d6 and on the
question of whether White should castle queen- side or kingside here. Nowadays 6...Jke7 is of- ten played. Black is satisfied with having driven

SICILIAN DEFENCE 427
back the knight and leaves it up to his opponent to play a kind of Hedgehog (with c4) or an inde- finable sort of Scheveningen Variation, for in- stance with 7 Nc3 d6. This idea is comparable to the variations where Black plays ...Qb6 to chase White's knight back to b3 and then drops the queen back to c7, such as 2...*2)c6 3 d4 cxd4 4 *21x44 @b6 (see page 404). Then there are the more subtle ways of mak- ing use of White's unprotected knight on d4:
5...*£}e7 and 5...g6,
The idea of S...21e7 looks fairly straightfor- ward. namely to play ...*21bc6 and be able to take back on c6 with the other knight. But it is in fact an extremely flexible move, for depend- ing on White's reply, it may be (even) more use- ful to play ...2)ec6 and develop the other knight at d7.
5...g6 is the favourite of players with a
strongly developed aesthetic sense (all pawns on a light square, the geometrical pattern), but it is also a powerful move. Black is planning to at- tack the d4-knight with 6...akg7 and to prepare an all-out central attack with ...*2)gc7 and ...d5. This would be quite unrealistic in most Sicilian Variations, but it makes good sense in this line because of the decrease of pressure along the d-file that is the result of White having played i.d.3. But the most modem option is not to worry about attacking the d4-knight at all and to play - typically Paulsen - the very flexible 5...*2Bf6 6 O-O (6 e5? Qa5+) 6...Qc7. This set-up has be- come especially popular with players who feel comfortable in a Hedgehog position (if c4 and ...d6 are played), but who want to keep the a3- f8 diagonal open just a little longer so that White still has to take moves like ...*2)c6 and ...Bc5 into account. The immediate 7 c4, for in- stance, is met by 7...4)c6 8 21xc6 dxc6 fol- lowed by ...e5 and ... .c5, emphasizing the hole in White's pawn-formation at d4. It is more cautious to play 7 Qe2 first and only after 7...d6 to venture 8 c4. Scheveningen Variation
4 ... W6
5 <2>c3 d6 (D) In the general introduction to the position af- ter 4 *2Bxd4 I have already attempted to make the reader aware of the enormous importance of the Scheveningen Variation. And by that I do not mean this particular position - although this certainly is an important starting point - but the pawn-formation ...e6 in combination with ...d6 in general, without White having played c4 and excluding a number of 'special cases' which cannot normally arise from this position. These we find mainly in the Richter-Rauzer and the Najdorf Variation. The formation ...e6 and ...d6 evolved around 1900 from the older Paulsen Variation where Black - as we have just seen - starts by keeping the a3-f8 diagonal open for his bishop but often ends up playing ...d6 anyway. It looks passive to 'lock up' your own bishops behind pawns at e6 and d6, and indeed this is precisely how this for- mation was seen in the 19th century, but with the rise of classical positional chess, this perspective changed. It began to be appreciated that Black's position is very solid and that even without a bishop on b4 or c5. Black has plenty of opportu- nities to become aggressive on the queenside. More in particular, the plan of playing ...a6, ...Rc7 and ...*2)c6-a5/e5-c4 at one point became so intimidating that the whole variation even be- gan to be thought of as favourable for Black! In the introduction to the Classical Variation (see page 405) I have already described how this process culminated (and came to a full stop!) in the tournament of Scheveningen in 1923, when Geza Maroczy so brilliantly de- feated Max Euwe. The Scheveningen Variation
428 FUNDAMENTAL CHESS OPENINGS
deteriorated, the Dragon Variation rose to the fore and shortly afterwards the entire Classical Variation (of which both the Scheveningen and the Dragon were then seen as subvariations) trembled at the arrival of the Richter-Rauzer Attack. But with the fast-growing interest in the Si- cilian Defence as a whole, new paths were dis- covered, some of which turned out to lead back to... the Scheveningen. The Richter-Rauzer At- tack was circumvented by delaying ...4?)c6 (as in the move-order we are talking about here), improvements for Black were found against Maroczy's play and - perhaps most importantly - it was established that an immediate attack on the queenside is not Black's only option at all. Then it was White's turn to start looking for alternatives to the classical Ae2 (which later came to be called the Classical Scheveningen). New variations evolved, founded on new inter- pretations of the Sicilian Defence. The Schev- eningen Variation was considerably enriched strategically and concrete variations became ever more complex. Also, around the middle of the 20th century some other variations for Black were devel- oped, like the Taimanov and the Najdorf Vari- ation, that were partly based on a possible transposition to the Scheveningen. Gradually, a climate evolved where the Scheveningen Varia- tion functioned as a sort of background to varia- tions throughout the Sicilian Defence. It is not surprising then that the importance of a thor- ough understanding of the Scheveningen type of position and of the complex of variations that goes with it can hardly be overestimated. But what exactly is this complex of varia- tions? Strangely enough, this is not an easy question. Systematizing the Scheveningen is difficult for various reasons. Firstly, this type of position is literally per- vaded with move-order tricks and with ex- tremely subtle nuances. Some characteristic plans may be executed in many different move- orders, all with pros and cons of their own. Secondly, for many variations it is impossi- ble to decide whether they should be classified as a Scheveningen or as some other system (a Najdorf for instance). And finally, these positions are almost al- ways of a type which centres on delicate posi- tional assessments rather than concrete tactical problems (which in the end can always be more or less solved by patience, analytical prowess or a good computer). All the characteristics summed up here are most prominent in the good old 6 jLe2 variation, the Classical Scheveningen. This is where we shall start our survey. Next, we shall turn our attention to the bold advance 6 g4. This is the Keres Attack, which has been considered the most critical test of the Scheveningen since the 1980s. When this idea was introduced in 1943 by the brilliant Esto- nian grandmaster Paul Keres it was a revolu- tionary concept. Nowadays the plan of gaining space on the kingside by advancing the g-pawn is commonplace in many different variations of the Sicilian. The latest variation on this theme is 6 Be3 a6 7 Qd2 in the Taimanov Variation (see page 425) and we have already seen the same plan executed on a grand scale in the Velimirovic Attack. But the more conventional 6 f4 remains an important touchstone of the Scheveningen as well. White prepares Qf3 and (again) g4-g5. These are the three main lines that we shall be looking at in somewhat more detail. The principal alternatives, which I shall just briefly outline here, are 6 g3. 6 icc4 and 6 jLe3.
6 g3 is the start of a solid but unpretentious
scheme of development, which requires little theoretical knowledge. Black's simplest reply is 6...4)c6 7 Bg2 jLd7 (parrying the threat of 8 £jxc6 bxc6 9 e5) 8 O-O kc7.
6 J.c4 is the favourite of lovers of the Sozin
Attack, to which a direct transposition is avail- able with 6...?)c6 (see page 409) and of players who like the 6 Bc4 variation against the Naj- dorf (6...a6; see page 439). Both of these lines could well be regarded as being part of the Scheveningen complex, but since in practice they usually arise via the Classical and the Najdorf Variations respectively I have decided to classify them as such. In the present move- order there is no need for Black to transpose to either of them (yet). 6...Jle7 is a perfectly good alternative.
SICILIAN DEFENCE 429
6 Ne3 confronts us with the same dilemma
of classification. After 6...a6 we have a position that is 100% Scheveningen but which in prac- tice arises far more often via the Najdorf and which I have decided to classify as such for pre- cisely this reason (see page 442). The alternative
6...,5''.c6 transposes to the Sozin Attack after 7
Bc4, but after 7 f4 it leads to the same position as 6 f4 7 Xi.e3 (see page 433), while 7 J.e2 is a Classical Scheveningen. However, nowa- days 6 J..c3 is mainly popular with players who are planning to continue along the lines of f3, Rd2. O-O-O and g4, the English Attack. They are more likely to meet both 6...a6 and 6...23c6 (and other moves like 6...JU7) with 7 f3. The moment is less well-chosen for 6 Bg5, the defining move of the Richter-Rauzer and a major variation of the Najdorf. After 6... .e7, the Najdorf-oriented 7 f4 is not very good be- cause of the tactical counterblow 7...h6 8 4-h4 Nxe4! 9 Bxe7 Nxc3. The Richter-Rauzer move
7 Rd2 is relatively better, but after 7...a6 8
O-O-O b5, for instance, the difference from the Richter-Rauzer Attack is to Black's advantage. White lacks the typical methods of attacking d6: Ndb5 or *2)xc6 in combination with jLxf6. not automatically guarantee White an advantage that every variation was treated more sharply and with more regard for its own particular characteristics. I have already described how this process took place for the Classical Varia- tion, which was the original starting point of the Scheveningen Variation in the first part of the 20th century (see page 405). However, it would be wrong to assume that this classical scheme of development is now outdated. In fact it runs though the entire Sicilian like a leitmotif and acts as a link between many different variations. 6 ... _le7 Since both sides have been fairly reserved up to now. the position does not contain any con- crete threats. As a result, there is no such thing as a forced move-order here; quite the contrary: both players have an almost unheard-of freedom of choice. Speaking very generally, it might be observed that a plan based on ...jLe7, ... hc6 and ...a6 is the most common and that there are a number of standard positions connected with it. that can be reached in one way or another. In this position, apart from 6...Jle7. 6...Nc6 and
6...a6 are the most important moves to head
for these standard positions. The position after
6...$)c6 often arises via the Classical Variation
or via the Taimanov (4...Nc6 5 <2)03 d6 6 Jte2 £jf6; see page 423), while the position after
6...a6 usually results from a Najdorf.
Naturally, there are also alternatives. Around 1940, a plan based on ...5ibd7 was called the 'Modem Scheveningen' and even upgraded to the 'Improved Scheveningen' some thirty years later, but despite these promising names this plan never managed to surpass the main line, which is based on ...4)c6. For example: 6...a6 7 O-O <2)bd7 (the immediate 7...b5 is met by 8 Jtf3, with the awkward threat of 9 e5) and now either 8 f4 b5 9 .f3 Jlb7 or (more restrictively)
8 a4 b6 9 f4 jfcb7 10 Bf3. The decision whether
to stop ...b5 by playing a4 is one of the great di- lemmas of the Classical Scheveningen. The more modem(!) version of this plan is to play 7...Qc7 (instead of 7...Nbd7). This move also prepares ...b5 (or ...b6 if White replies a4), but preserves the choice between ...Qc6 and ...S)bd7.

Almost all the main variations of the Sicilian Defence started out in life with the simple scheme of development based on Be2 and O-O. It was only when it was realized that this does
430 FUNDAMENTAL CHESS OPENINGS
By playing 9...jLd7, Black signals that he is not looking to start an immediate attack on the queenside. Instead, he is planning to exchange on d4 and play ..Bc6, a very natural and simple scheme of development and a sound way of keeping pressure on e4. Should White decide to pre-empt this plan by replying 10 <2Bb3. Black may play 10...a6 11 a4 b6, heading for the same type of position that we are about to see in the
9...a6 line.
9...Qc7 is possible because Black need not
fear 10Ndb5 Qb8. Otherwise, this line is very likely to transpose to 9...a6 10 a4 Qc7.
9...e5, on the other hand, aims for simplifica-
tion and an opening of the centre. The aggres- sive-looking 10 <2>f5 is not to be feared, for after 10...Bxf5 11 cxf5exf4 12 Exf4d5 aposi- tion arises where White's pawn is not very well placed on f5, since it has left the vital squares e4 and e5 unprotected (making a manoeuvre like ...ji.d6-e5 a realistic prospect for Black). Nor is 10 fxe5 dxe5 1 1 <2)f5 very dangerous af- ter H...l.xf5 12 Sxf5 Wxdl+ 13 Sxdl g6. White should be cautious with a pawn exchange at e5, for by doing so he solves the only struc- tural problem of the Scheveningen formation: Black's space disadvantage. The most popular reply to 9...e5 is 10 Nb3. Black can continue his plan of simplification with 10...exf4 1 1 jLxf4 Jle6 followed by ...d5 or he can play the more heavy-handed 10.,.a5. 10 a4 At the cost of a slight weakening of his queen- side pawn-formation (the b4-square). White pre- vents ...b5. Allowing this advance but stopping further progress of the b-pawn with a3 is a ma- jor alternative. For instance, there is the plan of playing Wel-g3, starting with 10 Wei. After

Black cannot take on e4 because of mate at g7. Black has to make sure of his counterplay be- fore White builds up too great a pressure on the kingside. 13,..Ac6 14 i.d3 Rd7 15 Hael a5 followed by ...b4 is a characteristic continua- tion. 10 ... Qc7

But the advance f4 in itself is an es- sential element of how this variation should be treated and this is what began to become clear in the days of Maroczy (see page 405). In fact, this is where the modern interpretation of the Sicil- ian Defence originated, for it was in this type of position that - after a period when it was thought anything would favour White, followed by a pe- riod when the startling discovery of ...a6, ...'S'c7 and ... c6-a5-c4 seemed to swing the balance - the real strength of White's position was first understood: instead of hiding behind the e4- pawn, waiting for Black to do something on the queenside. White needs to be aggressive and hit Black with either e5, f4-f5 or g4-g5. 8 ... £tc6 Naturally, the alternative 8...a6 is just as good, keeping the option of delaying ...4)c6 to a later stage or else putting the knight some- where else altogether. 9 i.e3 (D) 9 ... a6 I am adopting this move as the main line, not because it is the best or even the most popular move in this position (it probably isn't), but be- cause the plan of ...a6 and ...Rc7 is very impor- tant indeed.

This is one of those standard positions to which I was referring in the introduction. It is the starling point for an intricate maze of subtle and deeply studied variations. Since the ...Na5-c4 plan cannot readily be carried out yet (if ll...Na5 White has the sim- ple 12 Rd3, for instance), the development of Black's queen's bishop is the real crux of this position. Apart from the already-mentioned 1 l../2)xd4, the obvious way of doing so is ll...Jld7 (for ll...b6? runs into the powerful 12<2)xc6 Rxc6 13 c5 followed by Nf3). But if White then retreats his knight by 12 R)b.3 to prevent the ...<?Bxd4 and ...Bc6 manoeuvre, we suddenly find ourselves in a type of position where the bishop would really like to be on b7. not d7. It is characteristic of the thoroughly strategic nature of the Schcveningen Variation that Black can now afford to play an extremely subtle waiting move, which is not really a waiting move: 11 ... Se8 Not only docs Black delay the development of his queen's bishop, hoping that White will withdraw his knight voluntarily (in order then to meet 12 Nb3 very comfortably with 12...b6 and ...Ab7), but by playing this mysterious rook move he also strengthens the effect of a possible ...e5.

Instead of first developing his pieces and then looking around for a good plan. White immediately at- tacks, boldly and unreservedly. It took a long time for the chess world to grasp the enormous strength and significance of this idea, for it was not until around 1980 that this became a popu- lar line (some forty years after its introduction). But when it did finally sink in, its effects were felt in even the remotest corner of the Sicilian. Many new variations, based on the advance g4, were developed (like the English Attack against the Najdorf) and lovers of the Scheveningen saw their wide, safe and comfortable avenue change into a narrow and dangerous mountain trail. 6 ... h6

Most players do not like to have their knight chased away from f6, but in fact there is no real consensus as to what Black should play. It ap- pears to be very much a matter of taste. The variation 6".a6 7 g5 Nfd7 8 Be3 b5, for instance, could be called making a virtue of ne- cessity. While accepting the loss of space on the kingside, Black immediately counterattacks on the opposite wing, where the king's knight that has been driven away from f6 finds a new task. This is perhaps Black's sharpest way to react against the Keres Attack. 9 a3 Jcb7 10 h4 ,e7 is possible, when the d7-knight may find gain- ful employment on b6 or c5. Black retains a little more influence in the centre if he plays 6...Nc6 7 g5 £kl7. If then 8 Jle3, many players like to play 8,..Jle7 9 h4 O-O, seemingly castling 'into it'. But the point of this plan is that Black's king was not safe on e8 anyway and by castling he at least develops all of his pieces in a harmonious way, along the lines of 10 Rd2 a6 1 1 O-O-O Nxd4 12 ±xd4 b5 followed by ...Ji.b7, for example. This variation too can lead to very sharp play. We now return to 6...h6 (D): something with this pressure. As a result, Black does not have to hurry so much looking for counterplay as he often does in other variations of the Sicilian Defence. For instance. Black can now afford to castle queenside, something which is unthinkable in most other variations since it usually is the queenside where Black has to become aggressive. After 8...lTic6 9 Qd2 Rb6 10 Nb3 a6 1 1 O-O-O Nd7 12 h4 Ne7 13 Juc2 O-O-O 14 f4 Nb8, for instance, White will have to scrutinize the enemy defences for a pos- sible weakness, while Black will be looking for a chance to counterattack in the centre with ...d5. During the 1980s. players on the white side started looking for alternative methods, and it did not lake long for 7 h4 to come to the fore as the new main line. While is planning to play Sgl and only then g5, thus keeping his pawn- phalanx intact. Carried out in this way. the ad- vance g5 costs more time but its impact is far greater than in the variations without 6...h6, for there is the immediate danger of the further ad- vance g6 and with the h-file open (...hxg5, hxg5) castling kingside is no longer an option. Most players seem to agree that Black has to act fast before White gets his battering-ram in working order. After 7...Nc6 8 Sgl , one of the critical positions arises following 8...d5, but the surprising 8...h5 is played even more often. The point is to meet 9 g5 with the aggressive 9...R3g4 (rather than meekly retreating to d7). Ironically, 9 gxh5 Q>xh5 brings about the same type of po- sition as the 'old' main line 7 g5. 6f4

Until about 1980, when the Keres Attack took over, this variation was seen as the way of attacking the Scheveningen more fiercely and more directly than anything the Classical Schev- eningen has to offer. White's intended scheme of development is Rf3, Jle3 and O-O-O, when he can use either his e-, his f-. or his g-pawn as a bayonet to rip into Black's defences. Like the Keres Attack, this is not an easy variation for Black to handle, although theory has certainly come to terms with it over the years. The counter-punch ...e5 in particular has IfiiM s For a long time 7 g5 hxg5 8 Bxg5 was thought of as the main line in this position. White then has a bishop firmly anchored on g5 (he is in effect playing an improved version of 6 Jlg5 - see page 429 - since Black can no longer reply ...h6). and as a result he is keeping the en- emy position under pressure. On the other hand, the break-up of his kingside pawn-phalanx con- siderably weakens White's ability actually to do

began to feel annoyed at the new move 6 J-g5 instead of 6 Jle2, the alternative 2...d6 was 'discovered'. The idea is to be able to play - af- ter 3 d4 cxd4 (or 3..."211'6 4 2)c3 cxd4) 4 2)xd4 211'6 5 2)c3 - the fianchctto move 5...g6 imme- diately. thus reaching the Dragon Variation which until then used to be played via the Clas- sical Variation, a route made inaccessible by 6 jLg5 instead of 6 Jte2 (see the introduction to the Classical Variation on page 405). Around 1 940, 2...d6 was even called the 'Modem Vari- ation". proven itself to be an excellent way of throwing sand in the enemy attacking machinery. One of the oldest versions of this idea becomes appar- ent after 6...Nc6 7 Ne3 Ae7 8 Rf3 O-O 9 O-O-O Rc7, with the idea of 'refuting' 10 g4 with
10...4bxd4 11 Axd4 e5 (this is extremely con-
troversial because White continues unperturbed with 12 fxe5 dxc5 13 Qg3!). Later the immedi- ate 8...e5 (instead of 8...O-O) became popular, when 9 Nxc6 bxc6 10 1'5 is considered critical. The most recent variation is to play ...e5 even earlier: 7...e5. Another, much more provocative, method is to counterattack immediately on the queenside. The best-known implementation of this strat- egy is 6...a6, a variation that is often reached via the Najdorf. Black intends to meet 7 Jle3 with 7...b5 8 Rf3 Bb7, attacking e4. After 9 Bd3 Nbd7 10 g4 b4 1 1 21ce2 "2c5 12 <2)g3 a very sharp battle is in the making. If White plays
7 Qf3 in order to meet 7...b5 ? very strongly with
8 e5!, Black can make preparations for this ad- vance. either with 7...Qc7 (when e5 can always be parried by ...Jlb7, for instance after 8 g4 b5), or more subtly with the by-now familiar ma- noeuvre 7...Rb6 8 Nb3 >c7.

In the years when the Classical Variation was still predominant but players on the black side In (he course of the stormy development the Sicilian has gone through since, the name dis- appeared but the move has remained. 2...d6 is extremely popular nowadays, not only among Dragon devotees, but also among those who want to play the Classical or the Scheveningen Variation and who prefer the 'side effects' of
2...d6 (the alternatives White has to 3 d4 cxd4 4
Qlxd4) to those of 2...Nc6 or 2...e6. Besides,
2...d6 is the (only!) introductory move to the
Najdorf Variation, which in 1940 was hardly more than a footnote but has now become the most important variation of the Sicilian De- fence. What then are these side effects of 2...d6, and arc they less damaging than those of the other two moves? Well, in any case there are more of them. On any of the next three moves, White has a re- spectable deviation from the main road 3 d4 cxd4 4 "2\xd4 4)f6 5 <2hc3. 3 d4
434 FUNDAMENTAL CHESS OPENINGS
The 'standard' alternatives 3 <?2c3, 3 d3. 3 c4 and 3 c3 are nothing to worry the 2...d6 player.
3 Nc3 ( which was already discussed in the
section on the Closed Sicilian: see page 392) can be met by 3...€)f6, 3 d3 is about as good or had as 2 d3 (or 2 3 Nc6 3 d3) and for 3 c4 the moment is not very well chosen because Black has two ways of preventing the crucial follow- up 4 d4: 3...e5 and 3...dLg4. Things are more complicated with 3 c3. This move also looks badly timed because Black can reply 3...Nf6 without having his knight chased away by 4 e5. On the other hand, now that Black has already played ...d6. he cannot take over the initiative in the centre with ...d5, like in the 2 c3 variations, at least not without losing a tempo. Besides. 4...Nxe4 is not a threat be- cause of 5 Qa4+. It is true that this prevents White from playing 4 d4 (for precisely this move would allow 4...Nxe4), but he may sim- ply reply 4 &.e2. for instance. After a plausible continuation like 4...g6 5 O-O Bg7 6 Sei O-O 7 Afl White is ready to play d4, occupying the centre. Apart from 4 Ne2. the somewhat surpris- ing 4 Bd3 (intending 5 -fi.c2 followed by d4) and even the ultra-cautious 4 h3 have been played. None of these lines is an immediate attempt to go for the enemy's throat, but they are a god- send to many a player who does not trust him- self with the hyper-sharp and ultra-theoretical Najdorf or Dragon Variations. Not overly sharp, not loo difficult, requiring no theoretical knowl- edge to speak of, but perfectly sound and not what you would cal! spineless either. The same could be said about what is un- doubtedly the most important of the many 'side effects' of 2...d6: 3 £.1)5+ (D). This move aims for simplification and fast kingside development. It is also slightly more flexible than White's other third-move alterna- tives. For instance, after the plausible reply
3...Nd7 4 aS.xd7+ 'H'xdT White has several stan-
dard plans to choose from: 5 c4 is now defi- nitely more attractive than it was a couple of moves ago. as is the idea of playing c3 and d4. After 5 O-O £k6 6 c3 Nf6 White even has a choice between the cautious 7 Re2 (or 7 £cl) and the sharp 7 d4. sacrificing a paw n for the ini- tiative. based on the idea of meeting 7...Nxe4 with 8 d5 followed by 9 2e 1, with a consider- able lead in development. An ambitious alternative to 3...Jld7 is to play 3...Nd7, hoping with a later ...a6 either to obtain the bishop-pair (if White takes on d7) or to chase away the bishop. However, neither of these 'results' is favourable in itself: it all de- pends on the exact circumstances. White simply carries on developing his pieces, for instance by playing 4 d4 Nf6 5 Nc3 cxd4 6 Qxd4. Finally, Black has 3..3?)c6. reaching a posi- tion that was discussed in the section on the Rossolimo Variation (see page 402). 3 ... cxd4 Another distinguishing feature of 2...d6 is that it is the only second move where Black does not need to lake on d4 al once. The zwischenzug
3...Nf6 even used to be the main line when
2...d6 was 'modern' (around 1940). In those
days this was played in order to side-step the variation 3".cxd4 4 Nxd4 <?Jf6 5 1'3. Nowadays, what makes 3...W6 the preferred choice of some players is that it makes it impossible for White to follow 4 ?3c3 cxd4 5 Rxd4 £k6 6 Bb5 Nd7 7 Nxc6 Nxc6 up with a c4 forma- tion, like in the analogous line 3...cxd4 4 Qxd4 -?k6 5 Bb5 Nd7 6 Nxc6 Nxc6. If White refuses to make any of these conces- sions (minimal as they are) he may want to try to squeeze an advantage from 4 dxc5 4)xe4. Most players, however, do not worry about these sub- tleties and simply reply 4 Nc3 cxd4 5 <21xd4.
4 Nxd4
Another anomaly of 2...d6 is that it allows White to recapture on d4 with the queen, since
SICILIAN DEFENCE 435
after 4 Rxd4 5)c6, instead of losing time with a queen move he can play 5 Bb5. This variation falls into the same category as 3 c3 and 3 aLb5+. It is fairly popular with players who like their life a little quieter than is usual in the main lines of the Open Sicilian. Theory is uncompli- cated and White simply gets a reasonable posi- tion. On the other hand, Black does not have to worry about any acute problems either. The main starting position arises after 5...jLd7 6 i.xc6 Bxc6 (D). wants to play 6 c4. Around 1940, the c4 plan, which we have seen in several forms by now, was thought to be so powerful that any varia- tion that allows White to play this move was seen as inferior. But 1940 is a long time ago. Nowadays this type of position is seen dispas- sionately as having its pros and cons and fears of
5 f3 have subsided, though it has remained a re-
spectable option. Black may reply 5...43c6 6 c4 g6 transposing to a Maroczy Bind and hoping that the very' early f3 will restrict White in his choice of subvariations. Even 5...e6 or 5...43c6
6 c4 e6 is playable now that White has opted for
f3 so soon (which is. by the way, an excellent example of how finely tuned theoretical assess- ments can be, for it is less than half a page ago that 1 described 4...e6 5 c4 as being unattrac- tive'). But the sharpest and theoretically most critical reply to 5 1'3 is 5...e5, intending to meet 6 43b3 or 6 <?Af5 with 6...d5. Theory concen- trates mainly on 6 Jlb5+. At the cost of his bishop-pair, White has maintained the speed of his development. He can now choose between the nimble 7 3 4ihf6
8 Ji.g5 e6 9 O-O-O (which comes close to resem-
bling a main line) and the more heavy-handed 7 c4, which rather resembles a Maroczy Bind. 4 ... 2>f6 Another difference between 2...d6 and its ri- vals 2...e6 and 2...<2)c6 is that any moves other than 4...431'6 are highly unusual in this position.
4...e6 is unattractive in a situation where it
allows White to play 5 c4 'for free' , i.e. not hav- ing made any concessions, such as 5 4*hb5 in the (comparable) Taimanov Variation. Nor arc 4...g6 and 4...43c6 5 c4 g6 very popu- lar, although theoretically there is nothing wrong with these moves. After 4...4)c6 5 c4 43f6 6 4k3 g6 (or 6...4)xd4 7 Rxd4 g6) we are in the middle of a Maroczy Bind (see page 419).
5 Nc3 (D)
At one time, 5 f3 was such a dreaded move in this position that 3...cxd4 was thought to be an inaccuracy. White avoids 5 43c3 because he In this position. 5...e6 is a Scheveningen and
5...43c6 a Classical Variation. I have assigned
these lines to 2...e6 and 2...43c6 respectively. But this is also the starting point for two ex- tremely important lines of the Sicilian Defence that we have not encountered via any other move-order: 5...a6 is the Najdorf Variation and 5...g6 is the Dragon Variation. Other moves are rarely ever played. 5...e5, which I have just recommended as the critical reply to 5 f3, is far less important here. In the position after 6 .b5+ 2)bd7 7 431'5, the devel- oping move 4)c3 is of far greater use to White
436 FUNDAMENTAL CHESS OPENINGS
than the little pawn move f3. But this is not the fault of the ...e5 plan itself for, as we are about to see, this move plays a crucial role in the Najdorf Variation. the highest level. Its theoretical framework ex- ploded, its subvariations grew sharper and sharper until finally refutations and refutations of refutations seemed to be coming quicker than lightning. And this process has never really come to an end. The Najdorf is very much alive and kick- ing. It offers lovers of the Sicilian everything they are looking for from their favourite open- ing: aggression, resilience, the perfect combi- nation of attack and defence. One thing has changed though in almost three quarters of a century. Where 'Don Miguel' himself and his fellow pioneers needed no more than courage and positional understand- ing, present-day Najdorf adepts have to be pre- pared to work extremely hard at their opening, for in some subvariations Black is skirting the abyss so closely that a certain amount of ready knowledge has become indispensable. But for his opponent the situation is exactly the same! The course of further developments is very- much determined by White's next move. First we shall look at the classical (and evergreen!) 6 Jle2. White simply allows 6...e5 and continues to test the fundamental soundness of Black's plan. Positional subtleties abound in this line. Next we shall turn our attention to 6 f4. This move also allows 6...e5 but White is directing his attention emphatically to the kingside and in so doing creates a more dangerous and ag- gressive climate.
6 Ac4 is sharper again. Just like in the Sozin
Attack, W'hite makes 6...e5 less attractive. But (again just like in the Sozin) the crucial ques- tion is whether White's bishop is not misplaced on c4 if Black switches to a Scheveningen type of position with 6...e6. Then we shall look at 6 Bg5. the move that was seen for many decades as rhe ultimate test of the Najdorf Variation. It is this move in particu- lar which has given rise to the most breathtak- ing complex of variations, richer in sacrifices, counter-sacrifices, destructive attacks and mi- raculous escapes than any other opening sys- tem. Finally', we shall examine 6 Jle3, the newest star in the Sicilian firmament. This old move was given a new lease on life in the 1980s and Najdorf Variation 5 ... a6 (D) Anyone seeing this little, seemingly insipid move for the first time will find it hard to be- lieve that 5...a6 introduces one of the sharpest variations of the entire range of chess openings. Unlike 5...e6, 5...Nc6 or 5...g6. it contributes nothing to Black's piece development. What does it do then? The answer is not at all obvious, but to those who have read this chapter carefully it can hardly come as a surprise. Black is planning to meet 6 Ae2, the standard reply to any Sicilian variation in the first half of the 20th century, with 6...e5. In the wake of the Boleslavsky Vari- ation (see page 405) in the 1940s the idea was bom that an ...e5 plan might be viable even without ...RJc6. In fact, this makes Black's posi- tion more flexible, for in many cases d7 is a better square for Black's knight than c6. Be- sides, 5...a6 has the advantage of making b5 in- accessible to White's pieces and of preparing the ever-useful advance ...b5. Under the inspiring leadership of the Pol- ish-Argentinean grandmaster Miguel Najdorf (1910-97), this idea was tested and found to be excellent. During the 1950s and 1960s. 'the Najdorf' became a very popular line even at
SICILIAN DEFENCE 437
1990s. originally by a group of English players, which is why it came to be called the English Attack. White is preparing to play 13. Rd2. O-O-O and g4, regardless of whether Black plays ...e6 or ...e5. These are the five main lines that we shall be looking at in some more detail below. But it is only fair to say that practically every legal move has been tried in this position and that some of these moves are perfectly sound, quite impor- tant and well-researched theoretically. Never- theless, within the enormous dimensions of the Najdorf they remain relatively 'small' and I shall just mention them briefly. 6 g3, for instance, is one of White's most solid replies. 6...e6 is a calm subvariation of the Scheveningen and after 6...e5 7 4'ide2 Be7 8 jLg2 White has a firm grip on d5, be it in such a way that he cannot really do very much with it. But even here accuracy and fearlessness are es- sential requirements, as is illustrated by the variation 8... bd7 9 a4 b6 10 h3. White sud- denly 'threatens' to become aggressive with 1 1 g4 and 12 *2lg3. By playing 10...h5, Black not only counters this plan, but he also threatens to take the initiative on the kingside himself by continuing ...h4. Similarly. 6 a4. 6 Nd3 and 6 h3 (intending 7 g4) have grown into respectable side-variations. Nowadays, even 6 Hgl has become an accept- able option and 6 1'3. a move that was practically never played until very recently, has become an alternative route to the English Attack (prepar- ing 7 jLe3 and avoiding 6 Jle3 gd).
6 Jle2
6 Ji.e2 (D)
In the early days of the Najdorf Variation, this move was self-evident. But even today there are many players who like this variation be- cause it offers the opponent just a bare mini- mum of targets for counterplay. 6 ... e5 It is on this move that the mighty structure of the Najdorf was built. Just as in the Boleslavsky Variation, the knight has nothing better than re- treating: 7 <2)db5 is of course out of the question while 7 invites the powerful reply 7...d5. And yet 6,..e5 is not the only way to justify
5...a6. Many lovers of the Classical Schevenin-
gen play 6...e6, preferring the Najdorf move- order to avoid the dreaded Keres Attack. Moves like 6...€)bd7, 6...g6 and 6...4jc6 have also been played and are not bad. But 6...b5. an almost prehistoric interpretation of 5...a6 which disap- peared from the arena even before 6...e5 first surfaced, is less reputable. The problem is that 7 .Nf3! cannot be met by 7...Jtb7 because of 8 e51, while 7...e5 8 "23f5 is now excellent for White. 7 4Bb3 With this move we have reached the most im- portant starting point of this line. Thanks to his pawn on e5, Black has more space than he nor- mally has in a Sicilian position and this makes it harder for White to organize a kingside attack. On the other hand, d5 is a potentially strong square for White's pieces. However, White's control over this square is not all that impressive. Contrary to the situation in the Sveshnikov Vari- ation, White cannot straightforwardly occupy d5 by playing jLg5xf6 followed by <?)d5, for Black will simply replace the one knight on f6 by the other (..."?-)bd7xf6), maintaining his influence in the centre. Many games that are played from this posi- tion revolve around subtle positional problems, but in a Najdorf a sudden tactical explosion is never far away. Against 7...Ji,e6 (the oldest move in this position), for instance. White has the sharp reaction 8 f4 (in order to meet 9 f5 with 9...Bc4) 9 g4. For this reason, most play- ers nowadays prefer... 7 ... J.e7
438 FUNDAMENTAL CHESS OPENINGS
During the 1990s the 14 plan was rehabili- tated, but now prefaced by 9 9?h 1. The idea is that 9...ile6 10 f4 exf4 11 jLxf4 leaves White slightly better off than in the 9 a4 variation. 6 f4 6 f4 This is more aggressive than 6 ,M.e2. White prepares the Rf3, A.e3 and O-O-O plan that we saw in the Scheveningen Variation. He can also retreat his knight to f3 without blocking his own f-pawn. Besides, the king's bishop might want to go to d3 or c4 instead of e2 on any of the next few moves and Black has to take the e5 ad- vance into account. 6 ... e5 Black has a large choice of moves in this po- sition but basically there are three different plans, or rather pawn-formations: ...e6, ...c5 and ...g6. The latter two are often combined. The immediate 6...e6 transposes to a very sharp subvariation of the Scheveningen (see page 433). This is actually Black's sharpest re- ply to 6 14. A set-up based on ...g6 can be reached in vari- ous ways. The straightforward 6...g6 is an option {if Black has an answer ready against 7 e5), but the preparatory moves 6...Nbd7 and 6...Qc7 are a little more cautious. Play might continue
6...Qc7 7 £rf3 Nbd7 8 Ad3 g6 9 O-O Ag7.
7 Nf3(D)
Getting to know this variation is not so much a matter of examining separate moves, but of grasping the strategic essence of the position. Several plans have been tried here. At first White concentrated his attention on the queenside, starting with 9 a4. The very logi- cal idea is then to meet 9...JU6 with 10 f4. not so much a display of kingside aggression as an attempt to gain control over d5 by playing f5. chasing back the enemy bishop. The standard reaction to this plan is to play 10...Rc7, en- abling Black to meet 1 1 f5 with 11 ...Ac4. After 1 2 a5 Nbd7 13 jle3 it may look as if White is getting on top in the battle for control over d5, but by playing 13...b5 14 axb6 Alxb6 Black is just in time to create counterplay on the queen- side. In order to avoid this problem, many play- ers began to delay f5, playing 11 'Adil Nbd7 1 2 Be3 instead. This gave rise to yet another char- acteristic type of position, since 12...exf4 13 Sxf4 ?)e5 became the usual reply to this plan. By giving up his stronghold on e5. Black yields control over d4 and f4, but is rewarded for this by a mighty knight at e5. This development in its turn made some play- ers doubt the efficiency of the advance 14. Dur- ing the 1980s it became all the rage to play 9 Jce3 Ae6 10 S'd2, creating a rather slow type of middlegame, where profound manoeuvring around d5 plays a predominant role.

on f4, White has the option of opening the f- file (with fxe5) to create attacking chances on the kingside at a moment of his own choosing, and in some cases f5 is a very useful alterna- tive. On the other hand, Black may try to at- tack the e4-pawn, which can no longer be defended by f3. The standard means of doing so are the ...Nbd7-c5 manoeuvre, developing the queen's bishop on b7 and opening the e- file by playing ...exf4. To begin with. Black has to protect c5. There are two methods of doing so. which differ only very slightly. At first it was thought that Black needed to prevent the white king's bishop from coming to c4 by playing 7...Rc7, After 8 a4 (to prevent Black's counterplay with ...b5) 8...Nbd7 9 Bd3 g6 10 O-O jlg7 White then has 1 1 Wei, intro- ducing a dangerous attacking scheme which is typical of any ...g6 variation, namely 11...O-O 12 fxc5 dxe5 13 Qh4 followed by aLh6 and 2)g5. Later. 7...<5)bd7 became the most popular move. After 8 a4 &.tl, Black has a couple of sharp options if White ventures 9 Jt.c4. He can either play 9...O-O 10 O-O exf4, intending to meet 1 1 Bxf4 with 1 1...Rb6+ (there is the al- ternative of playing 10".Rb6+ 11 < Nhl exf4). or he can play 9...Ra5, threatening 10...Nxe4 (and hoping for 10 O-O?? Rc5+). For these reasons, most players prefer to de- velop their king's bishop to d3 rather than c4 voluntarily, i.e. without being forced to do so by 7...Rc7. After 9 jid3 O-O 10 O-O Black again has the chance to stir up trouble with 10...exf4. intending to grab a pawn with 1 1 lLxf4 Rb6+ 12 sfehl Rxb2, but this is double-edged and highly controversial. If Black prefers a some- what safer course, he usually plays 10...Rc7 af- ter all, or 10,..?3c5 (based on the trap 11 fxe5 dxe5 12 Nxe5?? Rd4+). 6 jlc4 6 4c4 This way of tackling the Najdorf became popular thanks to the excellent results Bobby Fischer had with it around 1960 and is often called the Fischer Variation. But when he started playing against it a few years later and was again very successful, its reputation dwin- dled. By the end of the 1980s, however, 6 J_c4 was all the rage again and it has now definitely been accepted as a major variation even at the highest level. Just as in the Sozin Attack (where Black has played ...Nc6 instead of ...a6), 6 Jc.c4 makes the reply 6...e5 less attractive. Thanks to his in- creased control over d5, White can now not only play 7 Nf.5 but even 7 Ndc2, when the situation is more favourable for him than in, say, the vari- ations 6 Ae2 e5 7 Nb3 or 6 g3 e5 7 4)de2. Nor is 6...b5 something to worry about, for the situ- ation remains largely unchanged after the sim- ple retreat 7 Jlb3 (which after 7,..e6 transposes to the line 6...e6 7 Bb3 b5 - see below). 6 ... e6 (D) The crucial question is whether White's bishop is well-placed or misplaced on c4 after this 'Schcvcningen' reply.

This seemingly timid little step backwards is in reality the introduction to an aggressive plan, or rather to a great many different plans, which I already listed in the section on the Sozin At- tack. In the near future. White may try to blow- up Black's central bastion at e6 with f4-f5, he may chase away Black's knight from 1'6 with f4 and e5 (which has the added advantage of open- ing the file - after ...dxe5 and fxe5 - creating dangerous attacking chances), or he may play Jfe3, Re2, O-O-O and g4, the basic scheme of the dangerous Velimirovic Attack.

the solid 7 Qf5, White even has the direct 7 Bxf6 Rxf6 8 <52>d5 to make life difficult for his opponent). White creates a certain positional tension by introducing the possibility of Ji.xf6, the ramifications of which are hard to assess. But the crucial question (again) is how good or bad the position of White's bishop really is at g5 after the obvious reply: 6 ... e6 If White now chooses the typical Richter- Rauzer plan of 7 Rd2, the reply 7..Be7 brings about a position that we have seen as part of the Scheveningen Variation (see page 429) and which does not impress theory as very promis- ing for White. This means, though it is still barely visible to the naked eye. that White has burned his bridges by playing 6 A.g5. In order to justify this aggressive move, he has to con- tinue aggressively. At first, the appropriate way of doing so was thought to be 7 Rf3. but as early as the 1950s it was discovered that only by advancing his f- pawn can White put real pressure on the enemy position:
7 1'4 (D)
Especially with a view to discouraging the latter option, it seems obvious to reply 7...b5. Black assumes a threatening pose on the queen- side and creates the possibility of playing ...b4 and ...<2!xe4, winning a pawn. During the 1960s and 1970s, the entire 6 Jl.c4 variation revolved around this position and more in particular around the plan of 8 O-O followed by 9 f4. But despite the most heroic analytical efforts to prove a forced win for White in the variation 8 O-O Be7 9 14 i.b7 10 e5 d.xe5 1 1 fxe5, Black's defences were never overcome (H...jLc5! 12 .a.e3 ?3c6! 13 exf6 Jtxd4) and finally interest dwindled. The reason why 6 ±c4 came back into fash- ion around 1990 was the rise of the more re- strained approach involving 9 Rf3 (instead of 9 f4), which not only threatens 10 e5 but intro- duces the manoeuvre Rg3. putting pressure on g7. In order to avoid this new line, Black started looking for alternatives to what was until then the unquestioned main line. 7...b5. Naturally, by playing 7...'5)c6 Black can transpose to the Sozin Attack, but apparently this does not satisfy the ambitious Najdorf player, for the search continued.
7...jLe7 is an option, but this move receives
very rough treatment with 8 g4. Finally, it was 7..ZNbd7 that turned out to be Black's main alternative to the old main line. Black puts his knight on c5 and forces White to act energetically. After 8 f4 S)c5 a whole new complex of variations has been de- veloped. White has tried 9 f'5, 9 e5 dxe5 10 fxe5 Nfd7 1 1 Nf4, 9 Qf3 and 9 O-O. That a pawn sacrifice is all in a day's work in this variation is clear enough from this list of op- tions. After 9 O-O Nfxe4 10 Nxe4 <2)xe4, for instance. White plays 11 f5 e5 12 Rh5 and ob- tains a dangerous initiative.

This move is based on the same idea as the Richter-Rauzer Attack (which is still within Black's reach: transposes). While mak- ing the reply 6...e5 very unattractive (apart from This position is the starting point for a great number of hair-raising variations, some of them analysed so deeply as to touch bottom with a forced mate or a draw by perpetual check, some of them extending into a difficult endgame. There is a really big chunk of theoretical knowl- edge waiting for the diligent student here with refinements and spectacular new finds being added almost daily.

There is little I can do within the limits set by this book but to outline the main structure and to give just an inkling of the actual variations and to leave less usual moves (like 7...Jld7, or
7...Nc6, which is based on the tactical point 8
4)xc6 bxc6 9 e5 h6 10 jk.h4 g5 1 1 fxg5 <?3d5) aside.
7...jLe7 is the classical move, not with the
idea of crazily castling straight into White's kingside attack but in order to continue after 8 Qf3 with 8...Rc7 9 O-O-O bd7, followed by ...b5 and ...Ab7. The reply 10 g4 has evolved as the main line in this position. If 10...b5. White wants to attack Black's central stronghold at e6 with 1 1 ±xf6 Nxf6 12 g5 Nd7 13 f5. The fact that this allows Black to win a pawn on g5 (and with check!) does not worry White, who is counting on the open g-file as a future base of attack. Instead of playing 8...Rc7. Black can open the kingside himself with 8...h6 9 .h4 g5!? 10 fxg5 £rfd7. This is the Gothenburg Variation, obviously an extremely risky under- taking but - as yet - unrefuted. Even at an early stage of the Najdorf Varia- tion's history, attempts were made to accelerate the classical plan of playing ...b5. This started with the variations 7...Nbd7 and 7...Rc7 being developed. By economizing on ...Jle7. Black is hoping to be fast enough to defuse White's most dangerous plans, like the 10 g4 line given above. After 7...Qbd7 8 W3 c7 (8...b5 runs into 9 e5!) 9 O-O-O b5, for instance, White has tried to raze Black's position to the ground in several ways, but - up to now - to no avail. A few examples: 10 c5 Ab7 11 Bh3 dxe5 12 Nxe6 fxc6 13 Qxe6+, or 10 Bxb5 axb5 11 £jdxb5 Qb8 12 e5. And what should we think of
7...Qc7 8 Qf3 b5 9 O-O-O b4 and now 10 21d5!?
or 10 e5 Nb7 1 J 2icb5!? axb5 12 Nxb5+ bd7
13 Qh3, threatening 14 Nxe6 fxe6 15 Rxe6+?
And these are not coffee-house games, but prod- ucts of thorough, deadly serious analysis! But the culmination of this strategy is un- doubtedly to play 7...b5 at once, without any form of preparation. This is the Polugaevsky Variation, a line that is so breathtakingly com- plicated that a remarkable discrepancy has evolved between theory and practice: there is a huge complex of deep theoretical analysis, but there are very few games with this line. Polu- gaevsky (1934-95) himself described how he studied this variation several hours a day for half a year before he dared to play it for the first time. If White cannot refute 7...b5, it is a wonderful move. After 8 Qf3 Nb7 9 O-O-O Nbd7 10 Nd3 Nc7, for instance. Black has executed the clas- sical 7...Be7 plan by saving the move ...Qc7. The one and only critical reply must be the ob- vious 8 e5. The answer to this move and the point of the Polugaevsky Variation is 8...dxe5 9 fxe5 Qc7. Again, the aggressive 6 Ji.g5 turns out to have its darker side as well, for if 10 exf6 Black regains the piece with 10...Qe5+. The far deeper point, and the real miracle of this varia- tion, is that Black appears to be able to hold his own here, in spite of his enormous lag in devel- opment after, say, 1 1 Jte2 Qxg5 1 2 O-O. The second main line arises after 10 Qe2 <2bfd7 1 1
O-O-O (D).
White's e5-pawn is taboo: if ll...Qxe5? 12 'S'xeS 4)xe5, 13 ?jdxb5! is winning, while H... xe5? allows 12Ndxb5! axb5 13Qxe5! Qxe5 1 4 2d8#. The critical move is 1 1 ...Jlb7. White then has several ways of going for his opponent's throat with a knight sacrifice on e6. starting, for instance, with 12 Qh5 or 12 Qg4, or even 12Nxe6 immediately. Yes, play- ing the Polugaevsky Variation requires a com- puter-like talent for calculating variations with flawless accuracy. The same can be said of the last of Black's main defences to 7 f4: 7...'S'b6 (D), the Poi- soned Pawn Variation.
442 FUNDAMENTAL CHESS OPENINGS
comes a second paw n sacrifice to speed things up: 13 e5 dxe5 14 Bxf6 gxf6 15 <2Be4. This is the starting point for a terrific complex of varia- tions, based on themes like 15..Be7 16Ae2 h5 (to stop 17 ±h5+) 17 2b3 Ra4 18 2)xf6+l? Nxf6 19c4(D). Every method of protecting b2 is a small concession. For instance, 8 <2)b3 <52ibd7 9 S'f3 Ne7 10 O-O-O Rc7 and with White's knight away from d4 there are far fewer attacking chances than in the comparable 7..Be7 varia- tion. That is why the critical reply is just to play
8 Rd2. allowing Black to reply 8...Rxb2 (D).
It seems incredible that White should have sufficient compensation for the great material sacrifices he has made, but Black's position is extremely uncoordinated and his king has no safe place anyw'here on the board. According to the present state of opening theory, attack and defence are equally balanced, but... everyone is holding their breath for future developments. English Attack

During the past thirty years or so, this move has spectacularly advanced from a mere foot- note ('a very slow move indeed') to perhaps the new main line of the Najdorf Variation. This success story is based entirely on the strength of the plan f3. Q12, O-O-O and g4, which is in effect an adaptation of the Keres Attack to the specific circumstances of the Najdorf Varia- tion. The g-pawn is used as a battering-ram against Black's kingside. Three principled reactions have developed into the variations 6...e6. 6...e5 and 6...<2>g4.

6 ... e6 This leads, after 9 2b 1 or 9 $Jb3 (threatening

White (again) has a huge lead in development and Black has an extra pawn and the superior queenside pawn-structure. It is in fact very at- tractive for White to sacrifice this pawn, while it is equally attractive for Black to take it. An ideal setting for a ferocious fight! To show how wildly complicated this varia- tion is, consider 9 2b 1 1i?a3 10 f5 (other main lines are 10Xxf6. 10.i.e2 and 10e5. which has been very popular in recent top-level practice)

This used to be an innocent invitation to transpose to an 'ordinary' line of the Schev- eningcn Variation with an 'ordinary' move like
7 Jle2 or 7 f4. Nowadays everyone behind the
black pieces knows that he has to reckon first and foremost with a much sharper plan:
7 f3 (D)
White also has the even sharper 7 g4. This move shows a willingness to sacrifice a whole piece for a transition to Keres-like territory, for after 7...e5 8 €Bf5 g6 the knight cannot move. White is hoping to obtain sufficient compensation after 9 g5 gxf5 10 exf5. A criti- cal reply to this ferocious treatment of the opening is 10...d5. intending 11 gxf6 d4, with vast complications. Like 6..,e6, this move started out in life as a fairly quiet variation. Just as in the 6 Jce2 line. White was merely intending to keep the black fury in check and was hoping, in some nice and quiet little way. to 'do something' with the d5- square in the distant future. Black, on the other hand, was satisfied with having diminished White's attacking chances on the kingside and was counting on obtaining some form of coun- terplay on the queenside, also in the distant fu- ture. In those days 7 <R3f3 was the usual move. This blocks the f-pawn, but White is hoping to develop his king's bishop actively on c4 (and have an escape-square ready at b3). But it turned out to be quite uncertain whether this strategy really promises White anything after the simple
7... .e7 8 .c4 O-O 9 O-O ke6. Another solid re-
ply is 7...Rc7, preventing 8 Ji.c4 altogether. However, the real success story of 6 Ne3 is built on another plan: 7 <$)b3 Just like in the6...e6 variation, White intends to play f.3, followed by g4. If he succeeds in driving the knight away from f6, the knight jump <?)d5 might well become very powerful indeed. Therefore it is useful for Black to put his queen's bishop on e6. The most important starting point of this line arises after the follow- ing moves: 7 ... $.e6
8 f3 (D)
Black has to decide how to weather the storm of g4-g5. One of the major starting points of this line arises after 7...b5 8 Qd2 Nbd7 9 g4 h6 100-O-O Jlb7. One critical line is 1 1 h4 b4 and now 12 Na4 Ra5 13 b3 <2Uc5. The ultra-sharp alternative 12 <7)ce2 d5 13 .h31? dxe4 14 g5 has also caused a few headaches. Instead of
9...h6. there is the option of playing 9...'5)b6,
vacating d7 for the other knight. Paradoxically, it is slightly more solid to cas- tle 'into it' and quickly mobilize the kingside by playing 7,..£\c6 8 Qd2 Ne7 9 g4 O-O 10 O-O-O Nxd4 1 1 Jlxd4 b5, analogous to 6..Aic6 against the Keres Attack (see page 432). Black's 'normal' moves in this position are

counterattacks immediately with 9...b5 10 g5 b4or9...?)b6 10 g5 <Nh5. A radical and unorthodox alternative is to nip the advance g 4-g5 in the bud with 8...h5 or
8..Be7 9 Rd2 (9 g4 would be premature in this
position because of 9...d5! 10 g5 d4) 9...h5. anyway) or attack the weak points in the en- emy position before Black has time to consoli- date.
10 Rd2, 10 Jle2 and 10 h3 seem to have sur-

10...?fe5 both the quiet 11 f3 i2)bc6 12itf2and
the aggressive 1 1 4t)f5 have been played. 6 >e3 Ng4 6 ... 2>g4 This move came into fashion in the 1990s, after it became clear that it is more than just an impulsive reflex, for after White's natural re- ply, Black has a clear plan of action, daring of course but perfectly logical:

Dragon Variation Finally, we arrive at the original point of
2...d6: to enable Black to fianchetto his king's
bishop, the plan that had once worked so beau- tifully in the Classical Variation until that route got booby-trapped by the Richter-Rauzer and Sozin Attacks. But the joy of those players who went through this transformation of the Sicilian in the middle of the 20th century was short-lived. For as early as the 1950s. it became clear that the new move- order, though it does indeed offer Black a rock- solid route to the Dragon Variation, also offers White a new and very dangerous weapon to fight it. Unlike the Classical Variation move- order, where White has already played Be2 before ...g6. 2...d6 gives White the opportu- nity to play Xe3. f3, Rd2 and O-O-O. followed (in due course) by J.h6 and h4-h5. This is the Yugoslav Attack. Though perhaps not really a Black could be said to be playing an enlarged Dragon Variation. With his g-pawn on g5 rather than g6, his position is more threatening and aggressive, yet at the same time more vulnera- ble. White can attack his pawn-chain at once with h4 and the f5-square is a potential weak- ness (inviting White to play f5, for instance). White's main problem is the revitalizing of his queen's bishop, which has ended up in an offside position at g3. The obvious way of do- ing so is to play f3, followed by Bf2. but the immediate 10 f3?? is a bad mistake because of
10...£je3, when 1 1 Rd2 Nxd4 12 'S'xd4 2>xc2+

SICILIAN DEFENCE 445
The immediate 6 f4 is one of the oldest weapons against the Dragon. The idea is to punish Black for his neglect of the centre with
6... .g7 7 e5. Most players prefer to dampen
White's enthusiasm a little by replying 6...<2)c6 or b.-. bd?. White's most solid option is undoubtedly to play 6 g3. By fianchettoing his king's bishop. White protects e4 and discourages any attempts to play ...d5. He is hoping that his spatial ad- vantage will yield dividends in the distant middlegame, when <2)d5 may become a possi- bility.

Should White want to avoid this, he will have to withdraw the knight from d4, for 7 Ne3 is strongly met by 7...*2)g4. After 7 de2 Xg7 8 jk,g2 O-O 9 O-O, for instance, Black has

refutation of Black's opening play, this plan radically changes what was meant as a dynamic positional idea into a razor-sharp and deeply analysed complex of variations. 6 jLe3 This is the introductory move of the Yugo- slav Attack, which has been the absolute main line of the Dragon Variation for well over half a century by now. But there are other moves, which may be important for players who, for whatever reason, do not want to be engaged in a theoretical duel. To begin with, White can 'simply' play 6 Jale2. This is called the Classical Dragon nowa- days and it brings us, after 6...Jkg7 7 O-O <5)c6 (D), to the identical position that used to be reached via 6 Ne2 g6 7 O-O Ji.g7 in the Classi- cal Variation. Now, after 8 Jle3 O-O, White would like to continue 9 f4. but this move allows 9...B'b6, when the situation is difficult for White, who faces no fewer than three unpleasant threats:
10...Qxb2. 10... xe4 and 10... g4. For this
reason, 9 5)b3 is the usual move, which leads, after 9... .e6 10 f4, to another critical position. The classical moves are 10...Rc8 (to prevent 1 1 f5 and if possible to simplify the position with ... .g4) and 10...Na5 (in order to meet 1 1 f5 with 1 l..jLc4). A modern deviation from this line starts with 8 5 b3 straightaway, with the idea of either de- veloping the bishop more aggressively on g5 or of continuing with the restrained 9 2c 1 and 10 Jlfl to reinforce e4. If it is intended as an alternative start of the Yugoslav Attack. White should be aware of the fact that after 6...Bg7 7 Ji,e3 Nc6, 8 f3 leads to a position from the Accelerated Dragon where Black has the treacherous 8...Qb6 (see page 418). But 6 Jlc4 may also be the start of a to- tally different plan. If 8 h3 instead, another subvariation from the Accelerated Dragon arises, albeit not (yet) an exact transposition:

Jle3 <Nf6 7 Jlc4 Ra5 (see page 41 8). Now that Black has not yet committed himself to ...Ra5, there are a few tactical problems for White: if after 8 h3 O-O White plays 9 O-O, Black can re- ply 9...$Jxe4 10 Qxe4 d5 and if 9 Bb3 there is
9...l2)a5 to be taken into account. Remarkably
though, in practice many players ignore these options and simply continue 9 O-O Bd7 10 Bb3 3c8 or even 10...Ra5 after all. 6 ...

This is by far the most popular move. The im- mediate 8 J.c4 allows 8...Rb6 (as mentioned in the paragraph above on 6 Ji.c4). It should be added though that many Dragon players do not trust this variation and simply continue 8...O-O instead.

afford this move, but the point is revealed if af- ter 10 exd5 €)xd5 1 1 4bxc6 bxc6 White unsus- pectingly takes the bait by 12 £txd5 cxd5 13 Rxd5. After 13...Rc7! (based on 14 Rxa8 Jtf5!) Black has lost a pawn but he has gained three vitally important open lines (the b- and c- files and the al-h8 diagonal). Most players prefer the more circumspect 12 .d4. trying to exchange the powerful g7-bishop. Just how complex the Dragon variation really is, is illus- trated by the fact that after 12...e5 13 .c5 Black does not fear the loss of the exchange at f8 and calmly replies 13...Bc6. Of course, there is no compelling need to ven- ture 9...d5. The alternative 9...5)xd4 10 Jlxd4 Jce6 is the starting point of another multitude of very sharp variations. The consequences of 9 Jcc4 are even more difficult to fathom. Almost every imaginable scheme of development has been tried against this move. Black's main task is to keep enough pressure on White's queenside to prevent him from devoting his full attention (and attacking power!) to the kingside. A standard follow-up is 9...jld7 10 O-O-O, when the main line (if such a term is applicable to a continuously evolving universe like the Dragon Variation) goes 10...2c8 1 1 Jlb3 and after ll...£te5 12 h4, when the choice between 12...h5 and 12...<?)c4

3...4bfd7, 3.,.Ne4 and even 3...d4, or 3 exdS
Nxd5 4 Bc4. The latter variation was taken very seriously and analysed at top level in the days of Alekhine himself, but nowadays it is mostly a variation for the avoiders of main lines. Black has little difficulty obtaining a sat- isfactory position after 4...Nb6 5 Jlb3 <?k6 or
4...e6 and the same can be said about White.
Both sides are saving their energy for the up- coming middlegame. 2 ... 5yd5 (D) This move used to be played sporadically during the 19th century', but never at top level and never without receiving slighting comments such as 'a curiosity' or worse. It was only when Alexander Alekhine (1892- 1946) started to play l...£tf6 in 1921 that the move had to be taken seriously, for an opening idea of the great Alekhine simply could not be cast aside with superficial and shallow commentary. "What I play is theory" was not one of his dictums for nothing. And very soon this provocative move turned out to fit excellently into the then prevailing in- tellectual climate of critical investigation of all classical dogma. It has even been called "a striking example of the modern ideas, held by almost every great master in the first years after World War I". Contemporaries of Alekhine re- ceived his new move with great enthusiasm, and theory of the new opening flourished. After World War II this enthusiasm deteriorated, but in the 1960s and 1970s the fire was rekindled when a new generation of world-class players again used l...Nf6 to challenge predominant (and rusty) views on opening theory. 2 e5 This is just as provocative a square for the knight as f6, and accepting the challenge by chasing the knight again with 3 c4 b6 4 c5 must be regarded as a true test of Black's open- ing play. After 4...£ki5 both 5 £!c3 and 5 .c4
448 FUNDAMENTAL CHESS OPENINGS
are played. The sharpest option is to combine these moves and play 5 Ji.c4 e6 6 White is hoping to obtain sufficient compensation for the pawn he is sacrificing, after 6.. .<2\xc3 7 dxc3 _4.xc5 (7...£k:6 is the more cautious move) 8Qg4. Another possibility is to play 3 ?3xc3 4 dxc3 (or 4 bxc3) at once. Again White is hop- ing to take advantage of the many open files and diagonals for a speedy development, but without the extra complication of the loose pawn at c5. 3 d4 This level-headed move is unchallenged as the main line. White keeps the option of play- ing c4 in reserve and does not make any unnec- essary concessions. The crucial question is what to do after Black's thematic reply: 3 ... d6 (D) But for those who do want to know more I shall continue a little further. There are three main lines for White. The sharpest option is to create as broad a pawn-centre as possible by playing 4 c4 4<jb6 5 f4. This is the Four Pawns Attack. The most cautious is to take on d6. This is the Exchange Variation, which (for reasons that will be explained later) is most ac- curately reached via 4 c4 Q3b6 5 exd6. Between these two extremes of bravado and modesty lies the middle way of 4 4hf3. This simple, yet powerful developing move has been called the Modern Variation ever since the 1930s. Four Pawns Attack The positional tension is mounting. Does White have to allow his e-pawn to be exchanged and perhaps become a target for counterattack? Does he have to exchange on d6 himself, saying goodbye to the best part of his space advantage and its inherent potential attacking chances on the kingside? There are no easy answers to these ques- tions, nor is the Alekhine Defence an easy opening to play, either for Black or for White. To have arrived at this conclusion was suffi- cient for Alekhine and his fellow pioneers to justify l...'$3f6. And even today this will be all the encouragement and theoretical knowledge some players are likely to need. This uncompromising approach has brought White both glorious victories and crushing de- feats. But more than anything else, it is the most heavily analysed of White's options. A certain ready knowledge of the variation complex is a primary requirement for both players. 5 ... dxe5 6 fxe5 st)c6 The most usual move, but some players prefer
6...C5. Strategically this idea is totally correct (in
the end Black will always have to attack White's central formation with either ...c5 or ...f6) and it contains a few enticing tactical points, but of course it is also extremely risky to offer White an even more threatening pawn-centre. The most

Exchange Variation
4 c4 Nb6
5 exd6 (D) An uncomplicated treatment of the opening. White is satisfied with an easy development for his pieces and makes no immediate effort to blow his opponent off the board. Black now has a great many options for put- ting pressure on White's centre. He can play
9..dlb4 in order to contain the threatened 10
d5. 9...$lb4, intending 10 2c 1 c5, is a possibil- ity. Even with the loss of tempo (...JsLf5-g4)

seemingly easy reply 10 .c2 Bxf3 11 Axf3? fails to 1 l...Nxc4. 9...SV17 with the idea ...O-O-O or ...Sd8I? has been played. But most of the attention has always gone to what is both the most modest and the most pro- vocative move: 9 ... kei If White now simply continues his kingside development with 10 Jle2 O-O 1 1 O-O, Black at- tacks the centre with 1 l...f6, when after 12 exf6 Ji.xf6 13 Rd2 the strength of White's remain- ing centre pawns is more or less balanced by the pressure of Black's pieces on those pawns. But the most critical move is 10 d5. This can lead to truly chaotic situations. After 10...exd5 11 cxd5 '5'Bb4. the d5-pawn is attacked and Black has three ways of recapturing on d6, but 5...Rxd6 is unattractive since 6 c5 forces Black to put his queen on a rather unfortunate square: e6. This is in fact why the Exchange Variation is usually prefaced by 4 c4. If 4 exd6 immediately, there is no objection whatsoever to 4...Qxd6, when 5 c4 can be met by 5...5)f6. So the real choice is between 5...exd6 and
5...cxd6. Both moves are about equally popu-
lar. By playing 5...exd6. Black creates the same symmetrical type of position that we have seen in the Petroff Defence and the Exchange Varia- tion of the French, but with two small differ- ences. Since Black's d-pawn is not on d5 (yet), his pawn-chain is more flexible and since White has already played c4 his pawn-chain is (para- doxically) both stronger and weaker for his
450 FUNDAMENTAL CHESS OPENINGS
pawns on c4 and d4 are in need of protection. Black normally picks on d4 first, for instance by playing ...Nc6 and ...A.e7-f6. Another char- acteristic plan is to play ...d5 at some point, ei- ther to open the d-file or to force White to play c5. A possible variation: 6 4k3 jLe7 7 O-O
8 Be2 Ag4 9 b3 (enabling White to take back
on f3 with the bishop if necessary, without dropping c4)9...Nc6 10&e3&f6 1 1 O-O d5 12 c5 4hc8 with the idea of continuing ...N8e7-f5. Intuitively, 5...cxd6 is perhaps the more Ale- khine-like way of recapturing on d6, since this retains a good deal more of the positional ten- sion. Black still has the option of attacking White's centre with ...d5, but ...e5 may also come in handy. On the other hand. White now has a queenside pawn-majority that offers him a clear long-term strategic perspective. A straightforward (though by no means a forced) variation is 6 Nf3 g6 7 Be2 -Ng7 8 O-O O-O 9 53c3 Nc6 10 Ne3 Ng4 11 b3 d5 12 c5 <2)c8 13 b4 (with the simple point 13...Nxb4?! 14 b3, winning back the pawn al b7). But many players prefer to prevent ...Bg4, for in- stance by playing 6 Nc3 g6 7 h3 i.g7 8 Nf3. In this case, after 8...O-O 9 jle2 4k6 10 O-O jLf5 1 1 Be3, the even sharper 1 1 ...d5 12 c5 4t2c4 is critical. This position was hotly debated in the 1960s and 1970s. It is important to note that in both these lines, d5 as a reply to ,..-2jc6 is usu- ally answered aggressively with ...Na5. If, for instance, 1 1 d5?'. instead of 1 1 jle3 in the latter variation. 1 l...£ja5! 12 42d2? (12 £ki4 obtains some compensation) 12...3c8 wins the c-pawn. Nowadays 6 fi)c3 g6 7 jLc3 Bg7 8 Scl is White's most popular plan, specifically de- signed to deal with this type of problem. By quickly putting his queen's rook on cl. White reinforces both the position of the c3-knight and his c-pawn so that he can freely play d5 or b3 if needed. Modern Variation 4 2)f3 (D) White refuses to be tempted into playing the ambitious f4 and keeps both the exchange on d6 and the move c4 in reserve. 4 ... Ng4 This natural and aggressive bishop move has always held the most prominent place in the books, but it would be a mistake to assume that other moves must be inferior or passive. In fact Black has a number of very interesting alterna- tives. To begin with, the most obvious move is to take on e5: 4...dxe5. This exchange used to be criticized on general grounds, for White's knight is invited to a very good square: 5 4hxe5 (D) (5 dxe5 is far weaker since this would leave the e5-pawn really vulnerable after 5... .g4). The first player to question this judgement was Bent Larsen, who in an important game against Mikhail Tai coolly continued 5...<?Bd7, placing his (unprepared) opponent in a very awkward position. White either has to allow his actively posted knight to be exchanged or he has to try to annihilate his opponent with a knight sacrifice, 6 Nxf7!? Nxf7 7 Qh5+ 'i?e6.
ALEKHINE DEFENCE 451
Without retaliating immediately, Black none- theless increases the pressure against e5 by de- veloping his king's bishop at g7. This line was also thought to be inadequate at first, mainly because of the sharp 5 Ng5, threatening 6 Qf3 and 6 Nxf7, but it was rehabilitated when in the 1970s the calm reply 5...c6 (protecting the d5- knight and preparing to meet 6 Rf3 with 6..T6) turned out to be perfectly OK for Black. This discovery freed the way for a much deeper in- vestigation of 4...g6 and it soon became a very- popular line. There is of course the possibility of transposing to the Exchange Variation with 5 c4 43b6 6 exd6, or by taking on d6 at a later stage (for instance after 5 Ne2 Ng7 6 O-O O-O), but sound as this may be from White's point of view, it does not constitute a refutation of
4...g6. The only really critical move is 5 jic4.
More in particular, the position after 5...<2Bb6 6 Jlb3 Jlg7 (D) is of vital importance. The resulting position is extremely complicated. Most players assume that White must be win- ning somehow, but nobody is certain. Only a handful of specialists, mostly correspondence players, go in for this explosive variation. Nevertheless, 4...dxe5 is also popular in the ordinary chess world for it has turned out that
5...£kl7 is not the only attempt at 'justifica-
tion'. 5...g6 and 5...c6 in particular (intending to play ...<21d7 on the next move, when it will be much safer) are played quite often these days, with the latter being one of the main lines of the entire opening in modern practice. If in reply to
5...c6 White continues 6 c4, there is the nasty
riposte 6...|2)b4, threatening both 7...Af5 and
7...Qxd4.
Another option is 4...Nc6. This looks like a fairly blunt developing move, but it is in fact - as so often in the Alekhine - an outright provoca- tion. If White continues (meekly) with 5 Jle2, taking on e5 is fine for Black. This means that, unless White switches to the Exchange Varia- tion (by playing 5 c4 Nb6 6 exd6), he has no al- ternative but to go for an all-out fight, starting with the pawn sacrifice 5 c4 <22Bb6 6 e6 1?. Since
6...Bxe6? loses a piece to 7 d5. Black has to
reply 6...fxe6. White then calmly continues 7 ?)c3, hoping that the extra pawn on e6 makes it harder for Black to develop his pieces. If
7...g6, for example, the advance 8 h4 is very
dangerous. Black usually returns the gift by playing 7...e5 8 d5 Nd4, giving his pieces some air. The most important alternative to 4...aLg4 has traditionally been 4...g6 (D). 7 -?ag5 is White's sharpest option and 7 a4 the most subtle, but strangely it is the latter move which leads to the greatest complica- tions if Black accepts the challenge and plays
7...dxe5. A starting(l) point of profound analy-
sis is the position which then arises after 8 a5 N6d7 9 Axf7+ *xf7 10 Ng5+ Qg8 1 1 4be6 Qe8 1 2 Nxc7 Qd8 1 3 5jxa8 ( 13 S)e6 is a draw by repetition) 13...exd4. 5 i.e2 In this case 5 Nc4 would be fairly pointless since Black can simply reply 5...e6 without hav- ing his queen's bishop bottled up at c8 (which would be a major positional drawback of 5...e6
452 FUNDAMENTAL CHESS OPENINGS
in response io 4...g6 5 Jfc4). Nor is 5 h3 a par- ticularly good idea for after 5..jLxf3 6 Rxf3 dxe5 7 dxe5 e6 Black has every prospect of a harmonious piece development while White's e5-pawn is likely to become a target (...4£}c6 or ...2)d7). 5 ... e6 Now 5...dxe5 6 Nxe5 Jlxe2 7 Qxe2 would just be stimulating White's development and the preliminary 5...Ji.xf3 lacks punch, for after
6 Axf3 the desired follow-up 6...dxe5 is refuted
by 7 c4! 4Zhb6 8 Ji.xb7. But the motif of an ex- change on f3 is really important in this line, as is shown by the seemingly modest but very popular little move 5...c6. Black intends to meet
6 O-O with 6...Jlxf3 7 Nxf3 dxe5 8 dxe5 e6,
when he is hoping to pressurize White's e-pawn with moves like ...<2ki7. ..fUcl and ...Ne7-g6. Players who do not fancy this prospect used to play 6 *?)g5 instead of 6 O-O. This leads, after
6...Axe2 7 Qxe2 dxe5 8 dxe5 e6 9 O-O. to the
same pawn-formation but with a knight on g5 in- stead of a bishop on f3. which makes it easier for White to protect e5 and may increase White's attacking chances on the kingside (therefore Black tends to avoid this by playing 6...A1'5). Nowadays 6 c4 *vTb6 7 &bd2 is more popular. White prepares to recapture on f3 with the knight, while 7...dxe5 can now be met by 8 2)xe5!, when 8...itxe2 9 Qxe2 Qxd4 10 Ndf.3 followed by 1 1 Ng5 is very dangerous.
6 O-O ±e7
The most flexible move. 6...4)c6 has the drawback of inviting 7 c4 Qb6 8 exd6 cxd6 9 d5.
7 c4 Nb6(D)
In this position the central question still is 'to take or not to take". By playing 8 exd6 (or 8 h3 Nh5 9 exd6) White can bring about what looks like a favourable version of the Exchange Vari- ation, for Black's queen's bishop is not posi- tioned on the beautiful al-h8 diagonal, as it is. for instance, after 4 c4 £}b6 5 exd6 cxd6 6 Nf3 g6 (see page 450). But as it turns out. Black's
IV
position is still very resilient. After 8 exd6 cxd6 9 $)c3 O-O 10 Ne3 the characteristic advance
10...d5 1 1 c5 creates strong counterplay if fol-
lowed up with 11.. Bxf3! 12 jLxf3 #te4. After the further moves 13 Ji,f4 Qc6 (13...Nxb2 has a boomerang effect: 14 <bl "3c4 15 "xb7) 14 b3 &4a5 Black is ready to attack White's pawn-chain with ...jlf6 and ...b6. For this reason, 8 Cte3 or 8 h3 Jfh5 9 k?:c3 (White can allow himself the luxury of inserting
8 h3 because after 8...Axf3 9 Jfxf3 the b7-pawn
is under attack) has become the main line. After
8 h3 Jlh5 9 Nc3 O-O 10 Jle3 the moment is still
not right for Black to take on f3 and e5, while
10...Nc6 (again) allows White to take the initia-
tive with 11 exd6 cxd6 12 d5. Some Alekhine specialists have experimented with 10...a5, but Black's most popular move remains 10,..d5 with the idea of meeting 11 c5 with ll..Bxf3 12 J.xf3 <2)c4 followed by ...b6. But after 1980 this variation has taken a different course. Instead of the obvious 12 jLxf3, the seemingly very awk- ward 12 gxf3 became fashionable. Black cannot then reply with 12...l2)c4 because of 13 jLxc4 dxc4 14 Ra4 winning a pawn, so he has to re- treat. The resulting position (after 12...Nc8 13 f4 for instance) is very solid for Black but the initiative is firmly in White's hands (for the time being at least) and this is of course a most un- usual situation in the Alekhine Defence! Pirc Defence
1 e4 d6
So far removed is this opening from the world of classical positional principles that it was too modem even for the 'Hypermodern School', a movement in the 1920s that rebelled against the prevailing dogmas of that age and that produced, for instance, the Alekhine De- fence. Even as 'recently' as 1941, former world champion Max Euwe needed no more than a few lines in his standard work De Theorie tier Schaakopeningen to dispose of 1...d6, which he could only see as a preparatory move for 2...e5, concluding that "further examination of this move is unnecessary". It was not until the rise of the King's Indian Defence after World War II, that the ground was prepared for 1...d6 to flourish.
2 d4 Nf6 (D)
With this move Vasja Pirc (1909-80) put a new opening on the map in the 1940s and 1950s, and it soon came to carry his name (although the Russians also attach the name of Anatoly Ufimtsev to this opening). In the two decades following his pioneering work, 'the Pirc' ma- tured into a full-grown and popular defence to both 1 e4 and 1 d4. Ironically though, after well over half a cen- tury the old 2...e5 has risen from the grave and is sometimes played nowadays, although the more common version of this idea is 2...<22>f6 3 Nc3 e5. which we shall be looking at shortly.
3 Qc3
To a natural 1 c4 player, this move is proba- bly self-evident. But theory of the Pirc Defence has evolved far enough for two alternatives to be treated as independent variations. By playing 3 Jld3, White has a solid scheme of development in mind that is quite popular against l...g6. He supports his d-pawn with c3 and completes his kingside development with Nf3 and O-O. This is not an attempt to refute the Pirc, but it has the great merit of not offering Black any chances to strike hard against White's pawn-centre as in the main lines. After 3...g6 4 Nf3 Bg7 5 O-O O-O 6 c3 a position is reached that is usually arrived at via 1 e4 g6 (see page 462). If this docs not satisfy Black, he could try something a little more spicy, like 3...e5 4 c3 and now 4...Nc6 or even 4...d5!?.
3 f3 (D) is a favourite with the 1 d4 players.
B
The idea is to continue with c4, transposing to the Samisch Variation of the King's Indian Defence or something closely resembling this line. Thus, playing 3 f3 is really paying a great
454 FUNDAMENTAL CHESS OPENINGS
popular move-order to reach the Philidor De- fence (see page 339). compliment to l...d6, for quite clearly White prefers a King's Indian to a Pirc! But a more down-to-earth explanation is that this variation probably arises most often via 1 d4, when after
1...d6 White does not like 2 c4 e5 (see page
191) so he plays 2 c4. but then after 2...<2hf6 he prefers 3 f3 (followed by c4) to 3 S3c3 because this move offers a 1 d4 player the chance to re- main on familiar ground. After 3...g6 4 c4 jkg7
5 Ste3 we have a King's Indian Samisch (see
page 97), while the alternative 3...e5 4 d5 (or 4 <5)e2 followed by 5 c4) also gives White what he wants (in a strategic sense). The alternative 4 dxe5 is not bad either, by the way.
3...dS!? is a bold and radical attempt to alter
the course of the opening. Black is counting on the move f3 being useless (or worse) in case of 4 exd5 £txd5 or 4 e5 5)fd7 (even 4...Ng8 has been played) and above all play retains a dis- tinct 1 e4 flavour. The typical pawn-formation of the French Defence, for instance, is not far away: 4 e5 "2bfd7 5 f4 e6 6 5)f3 c5. 3 ... g6 This is the defining move of the Pirc De- fence. By developing his bishop at g7. Black creates the same sort of positional tension as in the King's Indian Defence. He does nothing to prevent White from building a strong pawn- centre, but he will soon start hacking away against it, either with ...e5, ...c5, ...Nc6 in com- bination with ... .g4 or ...c6 and ...b5. In general, play will not be as sharp and complicated as in the King's Indian. The extra move c4 makes White's pawn-formation even more threatening so for Black's counterattack to succeed it has to be even fiercer. Still, the Pirc Defence contains some sharp and danger- ous variations. But before we look at these, there are three alternative third moves for Black which demand our attention. For nowadays 3...e5, 3...?3bd7 and 3...c6 have become almost as popular as
3...g6. All of them are fairly young (mostly
bom in the 1980s) and based on interpretations of this position that differ considerably from
3...g6. One could call them trespassers on the
land of the Pirc.
3...e5 (D) is a move we have seen in the
chapter 'Other 1 e4 e5 Openings', for this is a White has a major alternative to allowing this transposition (4 <2hf3 Nbd7) in 4 dxe5. After
4...dxe5 5 Rxd8+ sfc'xdS a queenless middle-
game arises which looks a little better for White at first glance because Black's king has got stuck in the centre, but whether this theoretical advantage has any practical meaning is moot. The plausible 6 jLc4 is met by the surprising
6...jie6 7 jLxe6 fxe6, when Black's doubled e-
pawns are a little vulnerable naturally, but on the other hand they provide Black with a cast- iron grip on the centre. However, since not every Philidor devotee feels at home in such a simplified, sober posi- tion, it is only natural that the alternative
3...4.bd7 has also become quite important.
Again, if 4 $)f3 e5 Black has achieved his goal. But unavoidably, even this subtle move-order has its problems. Black has to find an answer to
4 f4 c5 5 4df3 exd4 6 'S?xd4, for instance. This
line offers White a space advantage and healthy open lines for his pieces. Remarkably, the most promising defence to this seems to consist in
6...-$)c5 7 ,*'.e3 g6, aiming to put pressure on
White's central fortress in the same way as... a 'proper' Pirc. Finally, there is the somewhat mysterious lit- tle move 3...c6, the Czech Variation, called af- ter a group of Czech players who popularized this opening in the 1980s. This idea is of a dif- ferent calibre altogether. Black is planning to meet 4 f4 with the powerful and unorthodox
PIRC DEFENCE 455
4...Ra5. This move not only threatens 5...Nxe4
but also prepares the counter-punch ...e5. No matter how primitive this plan may look, it is not easy for White to come to terms with it. The main line runs 5 Bd3 e5 6 <2}f3 Jcg4 and pro- duces sharp play. Players who do not feel confi- dent with this usually avoid 4 f4, but even then the opening is likely to run along unorthodox and challenging lines. If 4 Qf3, for instance, Black has 4...Bg4, creating similar positional problems to the variation 1 d4 d6 2 f3 Jlg4 3 e4 <7Bf6 4 \c3 e6 (see page 192). We now return to 3...g6 (D): have never really become popular (always with a few notable exceptions) and fall outside the scope of this book. So the Pirc Defence was thoroughly exam- ined, and it became a grown-up opening that began to be treated in a more businesslike man- ner. This culminated, towaids the end of the 20th century, in a new system which combined many of the ideas behind the older variations and starts with 4 jk.e3. This method became so popular in such a short period of time that it is only a very slight exaggeration to call this the new main line of the Pirc Defence. By playing 4 ,e3, White does not yet com- mit himself to any particular pawn or piece for- mation. He can castle queenside or kingside, he can move his f-pawn to f4 or f3 or leave it on f2, and by playing Qd2 White introduces the pos- sibility of playing Xh6 (which is also one of the ideas behind 4 ,g5). 4f4 4 14 A gallant move, known as the Austrian At- tack, throwing down the gauntlet at once. White is threatening to play 5 e5. Or is he? 4 ... Ng7 If this natural move were impossible, Black's opening play would have very little future. It is true that 5 e5 is a realistic option, but it is not a fundamental threat to the soundness of the Pirc. In fact 5 e5 is not even aggressive, but designed to simplify the position with 5...dxe5 6 dxe5. White is hoping to obtain a slight advantage in the queenless middlegame thanks to his space advantage, but practice has shown that after
6...Wxdl+ 7 'S'xdl #Jg4 8 Qel. for instance,
Black will eliminate the enemy spearhead with ...f6 sooner or later. Taking back with the f-pawn is less promising than in other variations which we are about to see: after 6 fxe5 Nd5 Black will find it relatively easy to attack White's centre with ...c5. Instead of 5...dxe5, even the much sharper
5...<2ifd7 has done very well in practice. Black
retains the tension in the centre, preparing to strike back very powerfully with ...c5.
[diagram]
This is the real starting position of the Pirc Defence. By playing 2...|5)f6, Black has forced his opponent to protect e4, but otherwise White is free to develop as he sees fit. At first this liberal attitude was - of course - seen as a sign of weakness. Looking at the opening from such a lofty perspective, one is al- most obliged to continue aggressively. Thus 4 f4 became the first main line of the Pirc. However, it soon transpired that Black's po- sition is not easily overrun by power play like this and White is in fact taking some chances himself if he persists in such an attitude. The second and far subtler test of the soundness of the Pirc is 4 4'Bf3. White calmly develops his pieces. Does Black have an answer to this too? Between these two extremes of fierce ag- gression and alert watchfulness, several other variations have been developed. We shall look into 4 Bg5 and 4 g3 a little deeper. Other moves, like 4 Ac4 Ag7 5 Qe2 (intending 6 e5)
456 FUNDAMENTAL CHESS OPENINGS
6...'53c6 is slightly less provocative. If 7 O-O,
Black intends to attack White's centre in a more 'conventional' way by means of 7...e5 or
7...Jlg4. The critical move is 7 e5, for now that
Black has put a knight on c6. he cannot easily counterattack with the thematic thrust ...c5. But there are other options. After 7...dxe5 8 fxe5 Nh5!?, for instance, Black keeps d4 un- der pressure and prepares ...f6. White's most recent attempt to win the strug- gle for domination in the centre is to play 6 jLe3. This move prepares Rd2 and O-O-O and does not commit the king's bishop yet to any particular square. It is characteristic for the precision with which all these lines have been examined that it is yet another plan of counter- attack that is considered Black's best chance here: 6...b6 with the twofold idea of playing ...Jlb7 and ...c5. The immediate 5...c5 (D) forestalls all these options. This is the crucial starting position of the Austrian Attack. There are two options for Black: he may want to complete his kingside development by playing 5...O-O or he may pre- fer an immediate attack upon White's central formation with 5...c5, if 5...O-O White again has the option of play- ing 6 e5 (with consequences very similar to 5 e5), but most players prefer one of three devel- oping moves: 6 .iLe2, 6 A.d3 or 6 Jie3. The best reply to 6 Jie2 is 6...c5 (or so theory will have it). If White tries to turn the opening into a sort of Benoni by playing 7 d5, Black's counterplay starting with 7...e6 runs like clock- work. The critical option therefore is to play 7 dxc5, when 7...Qa5! 8 O-O (8 cxd6 <2)xe4 fa- vours Black) 8...Rxc5+ 9 'S'hl produces a Si- cilian-type position. White will try to initiate a kingside attack with moves like f5 and Wel-h4. Black will either play the provocative 9...4)>bd7 followed by ...a6 and ...b5 (resembling the 6 f4 variation of the Najdorf; see page 438) or he may choose the more solid 9...Nc6 in combina- tion with ..Jtg4 and/or ...Nb4. To avoid 6...c5. many players prefer 6 4Ld3. for now that e4 is protected White can simply meet 6...c5?! 7 dxc5 Qa5? with 8 cxd6. Black has tried several other moves instead of 6...c5 and the main lines are 6...Na6 and 6...£k:6.
6../-?\a6 is aimed at achieving the advance
...c5 after all. After 7 O-O c5 8 d5 a Benoni-like pawn-formation arises. This usually leads to a sharp middlegame with White attacking on the kingside (f5, el-h4) and Black on the queen- side (...b5-b4). Black is aiming for the same Sicilian-like type of play that we saw in the 5...O-O 6 Ae2 line, which arises after 6 dxc5 Qa5 7 Jfd3 Rxc5. Now 8 Re2 O-O 9 Jle3 a5 produces a funda- mental position. Again, 10...Bg4 in combina- tion with 1 l...Nc6 is usually seen as Black's most solid plan. A sharper reaction to 5...c5 is to play 6 Ab5+. The idea of this move is a very concrete one (as is often the case with these early checks), for there is something 'wrong' with every possible reply to it. If 6...Nbd7, for instance, the advance
7 e5 is much stronger than on the previous
PIRC DEFENCE 457
move (the immediate 6 e5 is met by 6...<2)fd7). The main line runs 6....Nd7 7 e5 Ng4. when the razor-sharp 8 c6 is probably White's most dan- gerous try. The point of this move is to meet
8...fxe6 with 9 <2)g5. This looks extremely men-
acing but several defensive possibilities have been discovered. There is a beautiful (though not forced) draw by repetition after 9...Axb5 10Nxe6.Nxd4! 11 £jxd8.Nf2+ 12@d2 e3+ 13 'S'?e 1 Jlf2+. Another complicated line is
8...Axb5 9 exf7+ 'd71 (this is stronger than
9...6.f7 10 Qg5+) 10 Nxb5 Qa5+ 11 Nc3
cxd4 12 Nxd4. This position remains difficult to judge even though it has been analysed very deeply. 4£3f3 4 2)f3 This move poses problems of a more posi- tional nature. We have seen that against a set-up based on f4 Black has two fundamentally sound plans, ...e5 and ...c5. even though the tactical implications are often highly complicated. But if Black chooses either of these plans against 4 <2)f3, will he not end up in a rather dreary ver- sion of an l...e5 or l...c5 opening? 4 ... Ng7 (D) breaking up White's ideal central formation. A more subtle (and indeed more highly regarded) alternative is to play 5 Jte3 or 5 h3 O-O 6 ,Ne3, postponing the choice of a square for the king's bishop to a later moment. This line is closely connected with the variation 4 Jl.e3, which will be dealt with at the end of this chapter.
5 ... O-O
6 O-O (D)
Now Black will have to show his hand. What chances does he see for himself in this position, where White has occupied the centre in such a solid, non-fanatical, sound and careful way? Let us first take a look at what happens if Black plays either 6...e5 or 6...c5 straightaway. As for 6...e5, this move is conspicuous by its absence in both theory and practice. And yet there is no immediate objection to it! After 7 dxe5 dxe5 8 Qxd8 Sxd8 9 4),xe5 Black regains the pawn with 9...Nxe4. The reason why this straightforward advance in the centre is obvi- ously so unattractive to a Pirc player (in stark contrast to the comparable 5 Nf3 variation against the King's Indian Defence; see page 102) must be of a temperamental nature. The sober (not to say barren) position after 9 Jlg5 can hardly be more than just 'slightly better for White', but its most prominent feature is a total lack of targets for counterplay. Black is re- stricted to a purely defensive role (for the lime being at least), which is a big difference from the Exchange Variation of the King's Indian where there is a weak point in White's pawn- structure at d4.
5 Ne2
This modest but sound developing move is often called the Classical Variation (or Classi- cal Pirc). The seemingly more aggressive 5 .Bc4 has the drawback of inviting 5...O-O 6 O-O (6 Re2 is probably a better move) 6...'5)xe4! 7 ftxe4 d5,
458 FUNDAMENTAL CHESS OPENINGS
6...C5 is a little more promising in this re-
spect. for if now 7 dxc5 dxc5 8 #xd8 SxdS Black has some potential counterchances based on ...I2)c6-d4 or ...b6 and ...Jib7. But in this case the critical reply is likely to be 7 d5, trans- posing to the Schmid Benoni (see page 170). If Black is happy with either of the above lines, his opening problems are solved. But es- pecially for those who like to play ...e5. there remains an important question: are there any chances of successfully preparing this move?
6...Nbd7 is probably the first option that
comes to mind. Unfortunately, this has the draw- back of inviting the powerful reply 7 e5, be- cause 7...dxe5? 8 dxe5 Ng4 gets refuted by 9 e6!, when 9...fxe6? loses to 10 gS. This means that the knight has to move backwards. After
7...'Ne8 White supports his e-pawn with 8 Bf4,
when Black's position looks passive. The alternative 6...3bc6 is more active, but it is also rather provocative of course, for Black is practically begging for 7 d5. The idea is then to continue 7...5)b8 or7...4)b4 followed by either ...c6 or ...e6. At any rate, this variation creates a certain positional tension. It is therefore quite popular with the more ambitious among Pirc players. Still, if this were all the Pirc had to offer, the picture would be rather dreary. Fortunately for Black, there are two other moves, Neither of them seems to contribute much to the prepara- tion of ...e5 at first sight, but on closer inspec- tion they both turn out to be extremely useful. These are the real main lines of the Classical Pirc: 6...Bg4 and 6...c6. By playing 6...Bg4 (D). Black introduces the possibility of taking on f3. which weakens White's control o' er the central squares e5 and d4. The main line is 7 Ae3 <2)c6. when 8 d5 is answered by 8...Bxf3 9 Jlxf3 Ne5 10 J_e2 c6. Thanks to the exchange on f3. Black's develop- ment is running much more smoothly than after the immediate 6...*Nc6. His piece coordination is also much better, now that one of his minor pieces has been exchanged. Another option for White is simply to play 8 Rd2. This is a good moment for 8...e5. for although 9 dxe5 is still a realistic move, this exchange is now not as unpleasant for Black as after 6...e5. The more robust alternative is to play 9 d5. when 9...?3e7 10 fladl (to prevent Black from nibbling away at White's central pawn-formation with 10...c6) leads to a King's Indian-like position with chances for both sides. The calm 6...c6 prepares no fewer than three moves that in their turn are a preparation for ...e5: ...'Slbd?. ...Rc7 and ...Qa5. This shows up the darker side of White's solid opening sys- tem, for he hardly has any means of perma- nently preventing or discouraging ...e5. White usually continues in such a way as to be able to meet ...e5 with dxe5, hoping that his pieces will be just that little bit more active than Black's in the resulting symmetrical pawn-formation. A concrete knowledge of variations is not a pri- mary requirement in this line, but a subtle posi- tional understanding is very' useful. 4&g5

This move, sometimes called the Byrne Vari- ation, was popular in the 1970s, and then faded into the background, but it made a strong recov- ery at the turn of the century, in the wake of the fast-growing 4 Ae3 system. On g5 the bishop is more aggressively placed than at e3, but it is also more vulnerable. Naturally, 4.,Jtg7 is the first move that comes to mind in this position, but because White has the option of playing 5 'Q'd2 and 6 .h6, ex- changing dark-squared bishops, there has been a thorough search for possible alternatives.
PIRC DEFENCE 459
4 ... jLg7 5 i.g2 O-O 6 £}ge2 (D) This is a more harmonious development for the king's knight than 6 Nf3, although that move is certainly playable as well. This has resulted in 4...c6 becoming a popu- lar move. Black intends to meet 5 Rd2 with
5...b5. Exchanging on f6 is almost never a prob-
lem for Black in this type of position, as long as he makes sure that he can follow up ...cxf6 with ...f5, reopening the diagonal for his king's bishop. But there is no unanimity whatsoever among theoreticians as regards to Black's best fourth move. Probably the classical 4...Bg7 is played slightly more often. Against 5 Rd2 Black may choose 5...h6 6 ji.h4 g5 7 Bg3 h5. when the crucial question is who will benefit the most from a possible ...Nxg3. Another option is to play 5...c6 after all, not worrying about 6 Jth6. I shall return to this subject in the section on 4 Jie3. White's most popular reply, by the way, is the sharper 6 f4. 4g3 4 g3 In view of the great importance of the g3 sys- tem against the King's Indian Defence, it seems obvious that this could be an interesting set-up against the Pirc as well. Strangely though, this is a relatively recent variation that was not even mentioned in most opening manuals be- fore 1980. White makes no effort to refute Black's open- ing play by violent means. By giving his e4- pawn a firm backing, he is hoping to defuse Black's expected counterattack. Thus White is in effect hoping - just like in the Classical Vari- ation - to reduce the Pirc to a passive opening. 6 ... e5 There are other moves, such as 6...Nbd7 or
6...c6, but unlike in the Classical Variation the
immediate 6...e5 has no drawbacks, since there is no advantage to be gained from 7 dxe5. In principle, exchanging on e5 is not what White is after in the g3 system, nor is d5 the powerful option it is in comparable openings, such as the King's Indian Defence, where having a pawn on c4 strengthens White's queenside position. Quite the contrary, the idea of the g3 variation is to maintain the tension in the centre. With his e4-pawn firmly protected. White is working on the assumption that an exchange at d4 is not all that attractive for Black. But other forms of counterplay are not easy to find! So the open- ing battle revolves almost entirely around one theme: w'hen is Black going to take on d4 and what follow-up does he have in mind? Another characteristic of the g3 system is that a plan based on ...c5 is hard to achieve. 6...c5, for instance, is not a problem for White, for after 7 dxc5 dxc5 (7...Ra5? makes no sense now that
8...'R3xe4 is not a tlireat) 8 'Q'xd8 Exd8 9 e5 or 9
Be3 the g2-bishop becomes very powerful.
7 h3 (D)
This subtle preventive move is more often played than 7 O-O. since in that case 7...'?3c6
460 FUNDAMENTAL CHESS OPENINGS
cannot comfortably be met with 8 -Ne3 in view of 8...$)g4. - White has a choice between a plan with f3, a plan with f4 or 'just' Nf3 followed by Jl.e2 (or ji.d3. or jlc4) and O-O, sometimes accompanied by h3, sometimes not. The latter option is in fact a variation on the idea of the Classical Pirc and is aimed at smothering Black's counterplay. 4 Be3 has come full circle. Just as against 4 4Lg5, Black now faces a del- icate choice. Does he simply continue 4...jlg7 or does he prefer 4...c6. initiating queenside counterplay at once? The latter move has the undeniable advantage of saving a tempo if Rd2 and Bh6 can be met by ...Jlf8xh6 instead of ...A,g7xh6. Postponing ...Jig7 has in fact be- come an art in itself in this variation. One of the main lines, for instance, goes (after 4...c6) 5 'Qd2 b5 6 Bd3 (to protect e4 and allowing the queen's knight to regroup comfortably to e2 af- ter ...b4) 6...Nbd7 7 4?Bf3 e5. Here 5 h3 is a ma- jor alternative. The tactical point of this move is that, now that 6...'2Bg4 is no longer possible,
5...b5 runs into the powerful 6 e5. The strategic
idea is to meet 5...jLg7 (or 5...<R3bd7) with 6 1'4. The 'normal' 4...Bg7 again has the advan- tage of not yet committing Black to a plan with ...b5. Depending on further developments, Black could also lash out with ...c5 or ...e5. If 5 Rd2, for instance. Black can reply 5...Ng4 6 .g5, when 6...c51? is a serious option, while 6...h6 7 .SJ14 g5 8 Ag.3 e5 is also played. And yet, even here 5,..c6 is the most popular move. Black is simply not afraid of Ah6, as long as he has not castled kingside. If 6 Jih6. Black plays 6...Bxh6 7 'S'xh6 Ra5. Ironically perhaps, many players prefer the 'old-fashioned' 6 f3 in this case. This is the most important starting point of the g3 system. Just as in the King's Indian De- fence. Black now has a few solid options but also some astonishingly complicated ones. For instance, after 7...l2Bc6 8 Ae3 the straightfor- ward 8...exd4 9 <Sxd4 Nd7 10 O-O Se8 11 Sei Qc8 is sometimes played. The point of this idea is to meet 12 li'h2 with the absolutely uncom- promising 12...Se5!? 13 f4 Sh5. The alternative 7...c6 is more cautious. Black allows himself as much time for delaying ...exd4 as he can find. After 8 a4 (to prevent 8...b5)
8...a5 9 O-O Black develops his queenside with
9... a6 10 i.e3 2)b4 11 1 2 Ne6, preparing
both ..Jtc4 and the counter-thrust ...d5.
4 Ae3
4 jLe3 (D) Until the late 1980s. White usually prefaced this move with 4 f3, to prevent 4... 3g4. This now seems to have become obsolete for two reasons. First of all, there never was that much point in playing 4...<2Jg4 anyway, since White simply replies 5 Bg5 without really being dis- turbed in his piece development. The second and far deeper reason is that the whole idea behind 4 Be3 has been completely transformed. From a one-dimensional (though not harmless!) attack- ing scheme, based on Rd2. Bh6, O-O-O. f3. g4 and h4-h5, it has become an extremely subtle variation where - depending on Black's reaction Other 1 e4 Openings
1 e4 (D)
w Rxd5 the d4-pawn is attacked so White cannot play 4 <2)c3. The main lines are 3 e5 and the pawn sacrifice 3 Nc3 dxe4 (3...e6 transposes to a minor variation of the French; see page 353) 4 d5. Another interpretation of l...<21c6 which is even more provocative is 2...e5. Those who prefer to avoid these rather sharp variations usually play 2 £\f3, inviting Black to return to 'the civilized world' with 2...e5. It is of course more in the spirit of Black's adventurous first move to continue 2...d6 instead, in order to meet 3 d4 with 3...Nf6 4 <5k3 jLg4. This varia- tion is closely related to 1 d4 d6 2 £jf3 Bg4 3 e4 £rf6 4 Qlc3 e6 (see page 192) but with a knight on c6, the advance d5. which is the stra- tegically correct plan anyway, becomes even more attractive. Equally. I...b6 has been known for a long time, yet for this move official recognition has been even less forthcoming. In fact, theoretical manuals for well over four centuries agree that this is a fairly passive opening move. Black al- lows his opponent to take up a strong central position for free, without any immediate pros- pects of counterplay. The difference between the position after 2 d4 Jlb7 on the one hand and the one after 1 e4 g6 2 d4 Jfg7 on the other is that in the latter case a counterattack with ...c5 We have almost come to the end of our long and tiring journey through the world of chess openings. But for some the best part is yet to come! For in this final chapter we shall take a look at two openings that are both theoretically important and popular, even though they did not get a chapter of their own in this book (for which I offer my apologies). These arc l...g6. an opening that has been given many names over the years, but is generally known as the Modern Defence, and l...d5, the Scandina- vian Defence. Furthermore. I... c6 and l...b6 should be mentioned, but on these moves 1 shall be brief: l... c6 (D) is the Nimzowitsch Defence. This is a very old opening, but it has never really come out of that dark and swampy area on the fringes of opening theory, where only the reckless and desperate ever venture. It might re- sult in a difficult, unorthodox opening battle, but if Black does not know really well what he is doing he is likely to end up creating difficul- ties only for himself. The relatively best charted line of this open- ing runs 2 d4 d5, a variation on the idea of the Scandinavian. The point is that after 3 exd5
462 FUNDAMENTAL CHESS OPENINGS
adopt a c3 plan anyway by playing 3 Jld3 in- stead of 3 12>c3 - leaving the question just how dangerous this set-up actually is aside for the moment - there are a number of alternatives to
3...g6 in this case (see page 453). No such es-
cape-route is available after I ...g6. A major starling position of this line (which is also relevant to the opening 1 £}f3 g6 2 e4; see page 249). arises after 3 c3 d6 4 4Bf3 (or 3 4Bf3 d6 4 c3) 4...Nf6 5 Nd3 O-O 6 O-O. Black's clas- sical plan is to prepare ...e5 by playing 6...2)c6 or 6...Nbd7. The main alternative, aimed at un- balancing the position rather than equalizing it, is 6...C5. But it is obvious that, in an opening where White is given a free hand so emphatically, White can play anything he likes. For instance, a development of the king's bishop on c4 is much more popular here than in the Pirc (see page 455). After 3 Qf3 d6 4 jlc4 Q>f6 White has 5 Qe2, threatening (or at least toying with the idea of) 6 e5.
3...c5 is an alternative reply to 3 )f3. This
invites transpositions to various other open- ings. Both 4 *2Bc3 cxd4 5 Nxd4 Nc6 and 4 c4 cxd4 5 Nxd4 produce a variation of the Accel- erated Dragon of the Sicilian Defence and 4 d5 is likely to lead to some variation of the Benoni or another. If White does not fancy these trans- positions, he has two 'independent' alterna- tives. 4 dxc5 and 4 c3. 3 £tc3 (D) is a realistic prospect, whereas the correspond- ing thrust ...f5 in the former case is not. Only after (1 e4 b6 2 d4 Ab7) 3 J&.d3 is 3...f5 a possi- bility (based on tactical motifs), but the posi- tion arising after 4 exf5! ±xg2 5 Qh5+ g6 6 fxg6 is generally considered too dangerous for Black, so even this is hardly ever played. The normal move is 3...e6, when 4 Nf3 c5 5 c3 al- lows White to consolidate his central position. Modern Defence • - g6 In an earlier chapter I have already com- mented on this move, which is equally playable against 1 d4 and 1 e4 (see page 193). Black gives his opponent a free hand in the centre, but not without a reason. Just as in the Pirc - of which l...g6 is in fact a more radical version - Black has a veritable arsenal of strategies at his disposal to strike against While's central for- mation with great force.
2 d4 ±g7 (D)
The most important difference between 1...d6 and l...g6 is that l...g6 allows 3 c4 (see page 194) transposing to the King's Indian Defence or a related 1 d4 opening. Less drastic than such a shift from 1 e4 to 1 d4. but quite important nevertheless, is the dif- ference that by playing 1 ...g6 rather than 1 ...d6 Black allows his opponent a set-up based on 3 c3. In the Pirc this is normally impossible since playing 1 ...d6 and 2...4)f6 provokes £}c3. Al- though, as we have seen. White may try to In spite of having a wealth of alternatives, this robust developing move is White's most

popular choice (apart from 3 c4). White makes no attempt to refute l...g6 and offers his oppo- nent the chance to 'return' to a regular Pirc by playing 3...d6 and 4../2)f6. The question now is 'are there any other moves?'. In other words: what is the point of playing l...g6 rather than l...d6?. 3 ... d6 There are two alternatives. By playing 3...c5, Black opens the door to the same transpositions that we saw after 3 £tf3 c5. If 4 <?3f3 cxd4 5 £*xd4 Nc6 we have a Sicil- ian Defence and if 4 d5 it will be a Benoni. The- oretically. 4 dxc5 is perhaps the crucial move, or at any rate the hardest to judge. 4...Ra5 re- gains the pawn, but just exactly how dangerous is White's initiative after 5 jLd2 Rxc5 6 ~shd5?
3...c6 (D) looks slower than 3...c5, yet this is
in fact a highly venomous move. is closed off for the time being. Everything now depends on which side will be the first or the more successful in getting his queenside mov- ing: Black with ...c5 or White with c4? Players who do not like or trust this variation usually prefer 4 <2>f3 d5 5 h3. White prevents ...Bg4 and does not let himself be provoked into playing e5. This is a position which also arises via the Caro-Kann ( 1 e4 c6 2 d4 d5 3 Qc3 g6 4 h3 Jcg7 5 3, for example) and which of- ten leads - after an eventual ...dxe4 - to a typi- cal Caro-Kann pawn-formation. 4 -Nc4 is another plausible move. It is true that this does not actually prevent 4...d5, for if 5 exd5 Black regains his pawn with 5...b5 6 Ab3 b4 7 1R3ce2 cxd5, but most 3...c6 players do not seem to trust this line and prefer the less drastic
4...d6 instead. This produces a Pirc-like varia-
tion, where one of the theoretical issues is 5 Qf3!?e6 6&ge2. We now return to 3...d6 (D): line of the Pirc and superficially very attractive in this position as well - with 4...d5 5 e5 h5 (or
5.._'?hh6). Unlike the similar situation in the Ad-
vance Variation of the Caro-Kann. Black's first priority in this variation is to block White's kingside pawn-phalanx. If he succeeds. Black will eventually take the initiative on the queen- side in classical fashion with ...c5. This strategy is likely to produce some heavyweight posi- tional tussling, where a good general grasp of the position is much more important than con- crete knowledge of variations. For example:
5...h5 6 Ne3 Nh6 7 f3 ±g4 8 h3 ±xf3 9
Rxf3 £hf5 10 Af2 h4 11 i.d3 e6. The kingside White now faces the same basic choice as in the starting position of the Pirc Defence. Does he go for the classical aggression of 4 1'4. the classical solidity of 4 '2hf3 or something in be- tween? And what about the modern 4 jLe3 and other moves that we have investigated in the Pirc? Are they stronger or weaker, now that Black has played ... .g7 before ...Nf6? Let us first examine the consequences of 4 f4. Here there are three variations that have all been more or less accepted as playable (though all of them are regarded as riskier than a trans- position to the Pirc with 4...Nf6).
464 FUNDAMENTAL CHESS OPENINGS
possibly in combination with ...<2yf6. Black is hoping to reach the typical middlegame of the
6...c6 variation of the Classical Pirc in a slightly
more favourable version. A subtle variation! The most provocative move is 4...a6 again. Many opponents may find this rather phleg- matic treatment of the opening quite irritating, for Black is in effect practically ignoring clas- sical principles (and his opponent!). After a seemingly simple and solid continuation like 5 jLe2 b5 6 O-O Ab7 White still has to reckon with both ...b4 and ...<2)bd7 followed by ...c5. 4 (D) also has to be studied in combina- tion with its sister variation, 4 ±e3 against the Pirc. The most closely related to a regular Pirc is probably 4...5Bc6. This is an obvious move, for 5 d5 can be countered with the excellent 5...4)d4. The more restrained reply 5 J.e3 €)f6 6 'z2rf3 O-O 7 Ae2 is probably critical.
4...c6 is a more profound move (which is not
to say that it is better!). The idea is not just to be able to play ...b5 but also to prepare ...Rb6, in- creasing the pressure against d4 and against b2. This immediately produces some rather difficult strategic problems, for instance if play continues
5 Ag4 6 Ne3 Rb6 7 Qd2. It is clear that
White does not have to worry about 7...Rxb2 8 Bbl Ra3 9 Bxb7, but what about 7...Axf3 8 gxf3? And what if we continue this variation a little further with 8...?)d7 9 O-O-O Qa5, followed by an all-out attack on the queenside by Black with ...b5 and ...$)b6-c4 and an all-out attack on the kingside by White with e5. f5 or h4-h5? Finally. 4...a6 is even more provocative. Here Black intends to combine ...b5 with ... .b7, at- tacking e4; for instance. 5 Cif3 b5 6 Jld3 akb7. Likewise, if White plays 4 k'Bf3 (D). there are some adventurous alternatives to a transposi- tion to a Classical Pirc with 4..Ajf6 (see page 457). Black may of course immediately transpose with 4...4)f6, but - analogous to postponing ...Bg7 in the Pirc - it seems logical to try post- poning ...4jf6 in this case and developing the queenside first, with moves like 4...c6 5 Qd2 b5 or 5...C)d7. Again 4...a6 is a popular alter- native. more so in fact than in any of the lines that we previously looked at. Here too, it is a certain psychological element, as well as the prospect of attacking the centre with 5 Rd2 b5
6 f3 5)d7 and ...c5, that makes this variation at-
tractive. Other fourth moves present a similar picture. Black always has the option of looking for something better than a transposition to the Pirc Defence, but it usually is very hard to tell if these alternatives really are better. Theory does not provide us with clear answers (something it is not very good at in any case).

player is someone who does not need theoreti- cal confirmation and who is always willing to extend the frontiers of his knowledge (and ours). pawn on e6 or c6 to do the dirty work - this will have to be done either by the queen (2...Qxd5) or the knight (2...Nf6). Either way this will take up some time, which boils down to the fact that while Black is busy recapturing on d5, White will move his d-pawn to d4 and start develop- ing his pieces. But undeniably the strategic goal of l ...d5, the elimination of White's e4-pawn, has been achieved. It is not easy to weigh these two fac- tors against each other, the disappearance of e4 on the one hand and the appearance of a pawn at d4 on the other. Theory has always been rather sceptical about the Scandinavian, but there have always been staunch support- ers, great champions and exciting variations.
2...Rxd5
2 ... Qxd5 3 c3 The classical and most logical move. White immediately accepts the free developing move to which 2...Qxd5 entitles him. But the alterna- tive 3 -5)f3 is also not bad and perhaps rather frustrating to a player who was looking forward to the well-analysed 3 Qc3 variations. White gives priority to his kingside development and cashes the free tempo afterwards. Depending on Black's reaction this may be done with Nc3 or c4. for instance after 3...Nf6 4 d4 jtg4 5 Ne2 e6. 3 ... Qa5 The classical reply. Retreating the queen to d8 or d6 (3...'t d8 or 3...Qd6) is less compro- mising (for the queen is not safe at a5) but also less aggressive, though the latter move has also become quite popular of late. 4 d4 A powerful and consistent move, yet it re- veals the point behind 3...Qa5: the c3-knight is now pinned. 4 ... Nf6 There was a time when 4...e5 was seen as best on the grounds of a game Morphy- Anders- sen from 1858. Having eliminated White's e- pawn. Black now gets rid of all the centre pawns. But the price of this 'achievement' is high, for it is precisely in an open, symmetrical Scandinavian Defence 1 ... d5 (D) Whereas 1 ...g6 gives White a free hand en- tirely, l...d5 limits his choice to the utmost. These two openings arc opposites in every- thing. While 1 ...g6 is probably the ultimate in flexibility, I ...d5 creates a very definite type of position at once. And whereas after l...g6 the battle often takes a long time to get properly started, after 1...d5 there is a crisis already. For all practical purposes, Black is making a mockery of the Caro-Kann and the French De- fence. Why take the trouble to play l...c6 or l...e6 if you can play l...d5 at once? But things are not that simple of course, or these two ven- erable openings would not have got a chapter of their own in his book and the Scandinavian would not have been squeezed in at the end. Theory has a very different view of the matter. 2 exdS The great thing about the Scandinavian is that White cannot very well avoid this pawn ex- change, for 2 e5 Jlf5 3 d4 e6 would produce an Advance Variation of the Caro-Kann with a beautiful extra move for Black, who has econo- mized on ...c6. The great drawback is that Black will have to take back on d5 and that - now that there is no

position like this that White s lead in develop- ment becomes a telling factor. After 5 dxe5 Rxe5+ 6 Jle2 followed by 7 Nf3 or simply 5 £sf3, Black has far from solved his opening problems. 5 <2ff3 (D) e6 a critical position is reached. The great com- plexity of this variation is illustrated by the fact that the simple developing move 8 O-O is al- most never played. Much more popular are the sharp 8 Re2. the subtle 8 4ac4 followed by 9 Ng3 and the sobering 8 <5bd5 Qd8 9 l2)xf6-!-, when 9...Qxf6 is met by 10 Qe2. Without worrying about his c-pawn (10...jlxc2), White prepares both queenside castling and the stra- tegically important d5 breakthrough.
2...2rf6
2 ... Nf6 (D) Black would rather give away a pawn than a tempo by 2...'fi'xd5 3 <?3c3. Still, an eventual re- capture on d5 cannot be avoided and even after ...43xd5 White has the prospect of playing c4 at an opportune moment. But the big question is whether this advance builds up a strong or a vulnerable pawn-centre. It is around this posi- tional problem that the 2...iR3f6 variation re- volves. This is the main starting position of the
2...Rxd5 variation. The pawn-formation is iden-
tical to the one in those variations of the French and the Caro-Kann where Black exchanges pawns on e4, but the manoeuvre ...Qa5 gives the position a definite flavour of its own. There is little chance for Black to attack d4 directly, but he does have the opportunity of developing his queen's bishop actively. The variations roughly divide into those where Black plays ...Jtg4 and those where he plays ...Nf5. Apart from the immediate 5... .g4 and 5..Bf5. there is also 5...c6, a move that is often necessary in any case to prepare an escape-route for the queen. This allows Black to postpone the deci- sion whether to play ... ,g4 or ...jLf5 until the next move. The ...jLg4 lines are usually the sharpest, es- pecially if Black, after 5...Bg4 6 h3, for in- stance. does not exchange on f3 but maintains the pin on the f3-knight by playing 6...Bh5. The energetic but double-edged 7 g4 Jlg6 8 <Zie5, with the idea of continuing h4-h5. is criti- cal. Likewise. 5...c6 6 3Lc4 Xg4 7 h3 Bh5 8 g4 (or 8 Jtd2 e6 9 <2Bd5 Rd8 10 <?3xf6+) 8...±g6 9 £te5 produces some lively complications. A ...J.f5 set-up is less provocative. After

3 d4 This sensible move is the most common re- ply to 2...£}f6. Accepting the pawn sacrifice with 3 c4 c6 4 dxc6 is generally viewed as not very promising, since it is obvious that 4... xc6
5 d3 e5 offers Black sufficient compensation.
He has a lead in development and White has se- riously compromised his pawn-formation with holes at d3 and d4. Instead of 4 dxc6, however, there is the sound option of transposing to the Panov or the 2 c4 variation of the Caro-Kann
OTHER I e4 OPENINGS 467
with 4 d4 or 4 £jc3 cxd5 5 cxd5 respectively (see pages 378 and 376). Some die-hard Scandi- navian fans avoid these transpositions by play- ing 3...e6 instead of 3...c6, thus inviting their opponents not just to win a pawn but to build up a broad pawn-centre as well with 4 dxe6 ,xe6 5 d4. This may lead to dangerous complications after 5...Ab4+ 6 ±d2 ' e7! 7 i.xb4 Rxb4+ 8 Rd2 £tc6!. A more cautious reply is 5 £tf3 <2}c6 6 Be2 (instead of 5 d4).
3 Bb5+ (D) is a more subtle approach, keep-
ing the extra pawn at least a little bit longer. 3 ... ;Lxd5 It seems incredible but ever since around
1990 Black has had a serious alternative to this
almost self-evident move: he can play 3...Jlg4
(D).
This wild new variation is based on two ideas, one extremely sober and one that com- pletely sweeps away every rational or posi- tional argument. Firstly. Black wants to meet 4 Nf3 with
4...Rxd5 after all, this time with the explicit
idea of meeting 5 Ne2 (for instance) with
5...Nc6 6 4)c3 Qh5 followed by castling queen-
side, a plan that was not available in the regu- lar 2...Rxd5 variation. The modest 4 Nc2 can be treated in the same way: 4...jlxe2 5 Rxe2 Rxd5 6 #Jf3 e6 followed by ...4bc6 and ...O-O-O. Secondly, if White chooses the more ambi- tious 4 f3 jLf5 5 c4 Black sets the board on fire (almost literally so!) with the double pawn sac- rifice 5...e6! 6 dxe6 *2Bc6!, the same motif as in the 3 c4 e6 variation. The sparkling activity of Black's pieces and the annoying weakening f3, which not only obstructs the much-needed developing move '2)f3 but makes White vulner- able on the e-file as well (something that be- comes painfully clear after 7 exf7+? Qxf7 8 .e3 jLb4+ 9 Qc3 2e8) combine to make the position very difficult to handle for White and perfect for an aggressive and dynamic Scandi- navian player. ' 4 Nf3 (D) This cautious move is played slightly more often than the impetuous 4 c4, but both moves After the obvious reply 3...Jld7, White has a choice between the complications of 4 Bc4 .Ng4 5 1'3 Bf5 and the simple 4 .e2 Nxd5 5 d4. With Black's queen's bishop on d7 instead of c8, the pressure against d4 is weakened, which makes the ...g6 formation less effective. But
5....Nf5 is quite solid and likely to transpose to
the 'regular' 4...jLf5 variation with 6 4Bf3. The latter variation may look a little over- subtle for a fierce opening like the Scandina- vian Defence, but it would be a mistake to think that a few simple and straightforward de- veloping moves suffice to give White an open- ing advantage. A certain minimum of subtlety is required even here. The blunt 3 Nc3. for in- stance. transposes to a fairly harmless varia- tion of the Alekhine Defence (see page 447). In view of the fiery complications that we shall see in the next note, the cunning move- order 3 £jf3, with d4 to follow later, has been gaining ground in recent practice. 3...jLg4 can then be met by 4 Ji.b5+.
468 FUNDAMENTAL CHESS OPENINGS
13 Ng5 White has consolidated his central for-
mation but lost a pawn on the kingside. The more cautious approach is not to play c4 at all. After 5 ,Ne2 Jcg7 6 O-O O-O 7 5el, for instance, the position resembles some of the calmer variations of the Alekhine Defence, like 4 <21f3 dxe5 5 Nxe5 g6 (see page 451). Black is not under any immediate pressure, but neither is White.
4...Bg4 is equally logical and perhaps a little
more solid than 4...g6, since Black is not giving his opponent any targets. After 5 jLe2 e6 6 O-O '2)>c6 7 c4 41b6 a problem arises which is highly characteristic of this variation: White's pawns on d4 and c4 are both threatened by the immi- nent ..Bxf3. Although there arc several ways to do something about this (8 b3, for instance, with the idea of meeting 8..Bxf3 with 9 Ji.xf3 40xd4 10 jlxb?, regaining the pawn), there are many players who prefer to treat this variation either much more aggressively (with 5 113 Bh5
6 g4 Bg6 7 £je5, for instance) or more conser-
vatively (by omitting c4).
4...Af5 (D) is the least provocative move.
have their pros and cons, and theory does not appear to have any preference for either move. It is important to note though that 4 c4 Nb6 5 Nc3 allows Black to seize the initiative with the pawn sacrifice 5...e5l? 6 dxe5 Qxdl + 7 Qxdl Nc6 8 f4 Ji.e6, which offers Black a marked lead in development. White may play 5 <2M3 instead of 5 Nc3, which after 5...g6 or
5...jLg4 transposes to the variations 4 Nf3 g6
or 4 <£T3 Jtg4 below (though with White hav- ing already committed liimself to a c4 strategy ). It is precisely to avoid these variations that 5 4Nc3 would be the obvious move (if it were not for 5...e5), for 5 <2)c3 eliminates the option
5...jlg4, while 5...g6 now allows 6 c5 5)d5 7
Jtc4 with strong pressure against d5. In this position there are two main lines.
4...g6 and 4...Bg4. while a third move. 4..Bf5
is also played fairly often.
4...g6 is a real provocation to play c4. for al-
though it is obvious that Black's g7-bishop will then become very powerful and that White's pawn-centre might be at risk, W'hite's prospects of consolidating that centre and obtaining an opening advantage as a result look good. This variation is almost certain to produce a sharp fight. Some of the critical lines arise from 5 c4 €Bb6 6 S)c3 Xg7 7 Jie2 O-O 8 O-O and now ei- ther 8...Nc6 9 d5 2Be5 or 8...Bg4. Sharpest of all is to play 7 h3 (instead of 7 Be2) 7...O-O 8 Be3 Nc6 9 Rd2, when after 9...e5 10 d5 5)e7 1 1 g4 (stopping 1 1 ...Nf5) 1 1...f5 12 O-O-O fxg4 White can either proceed in classical fashion with 5 Ae2 e6 6 O-O (and after 6... ,e7 start wondering whether 7 c4 is going to be met by
7...Nb4), he can simplify the position with 5
Jld3. or he can play 5 '2)h4. The latter option in particular is a step into uncharted territory and can be said to mark the end of our journey through the world of opening theory.
