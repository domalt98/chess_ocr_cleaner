Dedication To the Hummels: Paul, Carla, Patrick, and Christina, with love and appreciation Acknowledgements Thanks to: John Tomas for his insights; Eric Schiller for advice on technical issues; Jeremy Silman and John Donaldson for chess inspiration; and my editor Graham Burgess for help in every aspect of the book's preparation. Preface This book is a companion volume and continu- ation of my Secrets of Modem Chess Strategy (Gambit 1998). I will refer to that book often and use the acronym 'SOMCS* for that pur- pose. A premise of that book (one that I find al- most self-evident) is that modem chess has undergone great changes both conceptually and philosophically since the time of the old mas- ters including Nimzowitsch. The latter was, I feel, a transitional figure who consolidated older theory and presented new ideas, some of which have survived to this day. My project in both books has been to identify and discuss the post- Nimzowitschian changes in chess middlegame theory. This involves an investigation of the na- ture of chess itself with an emphasis on experi- mentation involving an ever- widening set of ideas and positions which have gained general acceptance since his time. As this book began to develop, 1 realized that it was beginning to resemble its predecessor in terms of its structuring, layout, and verbal dis- cussions about theoretical issues. In other re- spects it was less like SOMCS than envisaged both because I placed so much more emphasis on complete games and because I kept adding new material about concepts not discussed in the former volume. Thus the two books stand in a theory-to-practice relationship, but they also have a Volume 1 - Volume 2 connection, with the second volume filling in gaps in theory left by the first. I have also stressed recent games that reflect current practice and thought right up to the time of publication. Before addressing structural and philosophi- cal issues in the Introduction, I think that it might be useful here to give an explanatory overview of the contents of this book. Much as with SOMCS, it begins with a look backward emphasizing a couple of areas that have seen a constant but unpunctuated evolution over the years. As in most of this book, I have chosen to investigate topics that were relatively neglected in SOMCS. One such is the concept of the 'surrender of the centre*, to which I devote a rather technical section describing its historical progress from the early part of the twentieth century to the present. Both that section and the next highlight the important relationship of space to the exchange of pieces, an area that has, I think, been inadequately addressed in the literature. Then the discussion moves forward in time to the extraordinary changes in the mod- em practice of and attitude towards develop- ment. To put bounds upon this immense topic, I concentrate upon recent ideas as well as meth- ods of development in specific pawn-struc- tures. The centre has always been considered sa- cred territory with assumed primacy over other areas of the board. What if, after all of these years of investigating it, we would have to change or revise our most fundamental theories about the centre's nature? Surprisingly, that's exactly what's happening in a radical change that has accelerated dramatically even since the publication of SOMCS. In that work I cau- tiously discussed 'the new relationship of flank to centre1 ; but five years later 1 see that this con- siderably understates the case. We have experi- enced an explosion in the use of flank pawns in nearly every context and type of position, so much so that this must be considered the most revolutionary development of chess theory and practice in many decades. I have naturally de- voted a lengthy section to this subject, but since that can only begin to touch upon the subject, examples appear throughout the book in many contexts, and of course in the games of Part 2. Another subject that I skimped upon in SOMCS was the contemporary treatment of doubled pawns (as opposed to a history of con- ceptual changes in their use). That receives spe- cial attention, as does the ever- more- important subject of the positional pawn sacrifice. I touch upon other pawn issues such as majorities and minorities less extensively throughout various sections. One might note that pawn-chains are

together lists for the best players in four histori- cal periods (with the number of such players in brackets): a) before and including 1900 [12]; b) 1901-1935 [22]; c) 1936-1970 [32]; d) 1971-2002 [35], with a subcategory for 1985-2002 in one case. Especially in the first few chapters, which tend to be more historically oriented, 1 have used statistics from these periods to try to iden- tify trends. For the book as a whole this tech- nique, inevitably inexact and subjective, has been kept to a minimum. The games in Part 2 of this book are meant to unify the discussion and illustrate key concepts from both books. With luck, they will also pro- vide an entertaining break from an ordered the- oretical presentation. Selecting these games has been enjoyable and challenging. I have tried to avoid the temptation to include chaotic strug- gles that illustrate 6-10 modem strategic themes in one game, although such contests indeed ex- ist. When too many 'counter-intuitive* moves are seen in a single contest, it is likely that the players employing them are doing so partly by accident! Good illustrations need a limited number of focal points, so the more typical game will involve three or fewer main themes. I have chosen a large majority of games from 1990 onwards, and within that time have tended to feature the play of leading grandmasters, Quite apart from the fact that they make fewer mistakes, top players tend to understand what they're doing! My notes are meant to be limited and non-obsessive. This is not a games collec- tion. Others have authored such collections more skilfully and with greater depth than I have attempted here. The publishers of this book, for example, not too long ago put out both John Nunn's CWerstanr/Zrtg Move By Move and Igor StohTs /rufructive Modem Chess Masterpieces, works involving more analytical detail than I have devoted to my Part 2 contests. I hope instead to have achieved a more casual presentation that focuses in upon conceptual is- sues and explains them in an accessible way. Since the publication of SOMCS, I have been thinking about the times over which criti- cal changes took place in the modernization of the game. Naturally all such changes assert given considerable attention in the section on development, but not in the chapter on pawns itself. The chapter on piece play initially deals with the controversial subject of knights developed to the edge of the board as well as elaborate knight manoeuvres. It includes a section on good and bad bishops in the context of their use as individual pieces, a topic I just touched upon in SOMCS. While the issue of two knights ver- sus two bishops (minor-piece pairs) crops up repeatedly throughout the book, it was given extensive treatment in SOMCS, and I only added enough separate material here to give a caste of the subject. Exchange sacrifices pop up everywhere; they are played so routinely that they hardly seem a part of theory any more, but still have new and noteworthy aspects that may be seen throughout the book. I have included a section on the early development of the queen, another subject that is only lightly discussed by other sources. The more general and/or abstract topics in SOMCS are incorporated into the text. Exam- ples of prophylactic techniques, for example, appear throughout the book. Although philo- sophical issues appear in the Introduction, they are limited thereafter since the main body of the book stresses practice. In general, opening play receives a great deal of attention. There arc two reasons for this- First, as has become a com- monplace observation, opening theory now ex- tends so far into the middlegame that it tends to determine the nature of the play that follows in terms of structure or piece placement or both. Thus the distinction between a study of middle- games and openings (never very clear anyway) fails to apply in many cases. Another motiva- tion for talking about openings and early mid- dlegames stems from the fact that anyone can pick individual middlegame examples and use them to say something like 'See? Capablanca was so classical in his thought* or to argue the contrary. But for openings and the pawn-stnic- tures which persist into the middlegame, we can clearly sec overall trends, discuss the extent of their use in practice, and do statistical counts thereupon. Regarding the latter, I have com- piled some statistics about the practices of lead- ing players for various epochs. Assisted by Steve Solas's historical ratings research, I put

themselves gradually and at no particular date. Nevertheless, I think that there have been three very softly bounded transitional periods since the mid-1950s. After an initial conflict between new and classical ideas, the creative experi- menters of the 1940s broke through old barriers and by the early 1960s had established the pragmatic basis for modem play. This dramatic achievement was accomplished mostly in the old Soviet Union and was at first only partially absorbed into Western chess culture. Naturally there was no halt to the progression of chess thought in the late 1960s through to the early 1980s, including a steady growth in the use of positions and structures that were previously considered inferior on general principle; and the steady infusion of new dynamic ideas con- tinued. But in my estimation the nature of that expansion changed as a sort of consolidation took place and new positional ideas began to appear. This emphasis was influenced by Pet- rosian's careful style, Fischer's technical profi- ciency, and Karpov's particular genius in less dynamic and (sometimes) more classical posi- tions, Play in that era underwent a distinct evo- lution marked by a dramatic rise in the use of space starved set-ups (with Western players fully contributing) and more subtle changes such as toleration for structural weaknesses (anathema to most earlier players, even the very best of them), an increase of purely pro- phylactic strategies, and a de-emphasis on rapid development and king safety. Then, as Kasparov has pointed out, some- thing very radical began to occur in the mid- 1980s. An almost chaotic dynamism seemed to take over much of the game while the more or- derly part was subject to extreme refinement and positional experimentation. This revolu- tion has to do in great part with the rise of the so-called Infomialion Age. We have seen the exponential increase and rapid dissemination of games and articles. The introduction of com- puters has had two major effects. First, the as- tonishing growth of information at players* disposal: portable laptops now carry hundreds of games by each opponent and thousands of examples of his or her favourite opening lines and middlegame structures, Then there has been what I feel is an even more significant change: that players on all levels are able to try out seemingly risky, paradoxical, and 'unprin- cipled' moves and strategies on a computer in order to. confirm whether they are unsound, playable, or strong. Contemporary play has thus been marked by much greater openness to- wards both positional and attacking strategies that were previously considered anti-positional and/or unsound. Important contributions are thus not only multiplying at an accelerated pace but coming from players of all strengths. Trying to make some sort of sense of this evolution is a daunting task. A book centred about practical play cannot begin to touch upon all of the relevant material. Every day in maga- zines, books, and on the Web, t would see inter- esting and worthwhile new games that were valid candidates for inclusion. We are experi- encing so rich a time in chess that, in the end, choosing among such examples and even among topics seemed almost an arbitrary process. For the average reader, this means that you should be able to find the strategic themes described here in many if not most of the new games that come to your attention, I hope that this book will to help you to identify these and thus to un- derstand the chess of our time. John Watson San Diego, California, 2003 Part 1: Theory and Practice Combine Introduction and Philosophical Considerations The goal of this book and its predecessor. Se- crets of Modern Chess Strategy ('SOMCS'), is to describe modem chess and in particular the changes that the game has undergone over the years and is undergoing today. Right away it is important to stress that I have mainly concen- trated on what players (especially masters) are doing, i.e., what strategies and ideas they are employing. To a lesser extent I am also con- cerned with what players are actually thinking when they employ these strategies. Therefore, although this Introduction deals mostly with philosophical issues, the heart of both books re- sides in the games and examples presented and not in generalities, I must also stress that in this work I am not describing, much less promoting, any method of teaching. The book makes no claims about how the beginner should learn, nor how the 1200 player or 2200 player should improve. That clearly involves factors other than the ways in which advanced players think. So one can form virtually any kind of pedagogical theory based upon this work; but, since I emphasize ambiguities rather than certainties, I doubt that most teachers will find it more than partially applicable. With those disclaimers, let me gingerly touch upon some philosophical matters. In SOMCS I introduced the phrase 'rule independence1, which was meant to describe the attitude of modern players towards decision-making, and in partic- ular with respect to certain topics in the book. I came up with that expression, an admittedly inexact phrase, as an abstract characterization intended to bring the reader some sense of unity with regard to some modem ideas and prac- tices. Of course, as an abstraction it lacks es- sential force and is fairly meaningless without scores of specific examples and explanations, as given in SOMCS and now in this book. A similar case arises when a chess author pro- motes the virtues of harmonious play* or 'har- monious interaction of the pieces', as many middlegame writers have done. This is hardly useful by itself; I suspect that if you asked even beginners whether they thought that harmoni- ous play was desirable, they would probably agree that it was. The author's task in that case would be to provide many examples of harmo- nious (and not so harmonious) play, describing what that means in each situation with as much detail as possible. In a similar fashion, I have discussed the ascendance of concrete thinking in modem chess, as opposed to reliance upon general considerations, hy giving large num- bers of annotated examples. Those examples with their corresponding explanations are the essence of the book, regardless of whether they fit into a general model. However, since the philosophical side of SOMCS attracted so much attention, I will try to expand upon and clarify a few points before getting to the core of the ma- terial. Probably the most important distinction that I should make is between (a) the belief that valid rules exist and (b) the idea that there are specific generalities that are losing relevance in

today's game because players don't think in terms of them. The former proposal is not of much interest because it is so vague and subject to various interpretations of the word 'rule1. But I have tried to show evidence for the latter claim, and to make the related point that the movement in modern chess is away from ab- stract theoretical thinking and towards a more open and realistic view of the board. To what extent that is true can be seen best by examin- ing actual practice. I would suggest that when one considers the many specific changes that modem chess has undergone, a handy way to think about some of them would be in terms of the limiting influence that certain general and specific assumptions have had on players' think- ing* Of course I am only describing an evolu- tion of thought, not saying that older generations played largely by rules or that modem ones have abandoned them outright. But over time, the changes have been considerable indeed. I think that most observers will agree that there has been an exponential increase in positions and ideas that are now deemed at least satisfac- tory but were once (sometimes not even that long ago) considered laughable, ugly, and/or unthinkable. This and other evidence indicates to me that players arc much more tolerant of ideas that used to be rejected 'on principle1. Such openness has been increasing throughout the last century; but recently it has accelerated, in part due to the availability of computer anal- ysis. The latter resource has freed players to try out almost any absurd -looking set of moves in the hope of finding something effective. What continually surprises those of us who grew up thinking in terms of classical principles is how often those absurd-looking moves turn out to be strong! Similarly, one marvels at how much players can 'get away with* in terms of ne- glected development, voluntary weaknesses, exposed kings, casual sacrifices of pawns and exchanges, and so many more things that might seem counter-intuitive. It's true that strong young players, raised in a more open era, seem to take much of this in their stride. They are, in my observation, less weighed down by philo- sophical worries than the rest of us. All this relates to the relationship between verbal explanations of play and actual master thought. My own view is that top players operate mainly from a basis of pattern recognition and calculation, and would have a very difficult time explaining in words why they made a complicated decision except by using some sort of radical simplification. By contrast, they fre- quently do provide a detailed explanation for a move by demonstrating variations, for example, in a post-mortem analysis. But in such an anal- ysis, how can so much information be gleaned from a limited number of moves? Clearly there exists a large pool of shared information be- tween any set of analysts involving chess pat- terns and associated assessments that are taken for granted by all parties. Referring to a study by the University of Constance that grandmas- ters have access to something like 100,000 stored patterns, Grandmaster Jonathan Rowson says: "In my view it's the brain that makes the patterns on the basis of experience, so all the grandmaster does is expose himself to chess in- formation and lets the brain rack it up in its own mysterious way " This corresponds with the study's finding that in complex positions, grandmasters tend to rely on those parts of the brain that are used for long-term memory, whereas less experienced players work harder at 'encoding and analysing information', Row- son continues "Moreover, we should not ignore the striking empirical fact that the vast majority of grandmasters started playing when they were quite young and continued to do so intensely until they became grandmasters. Thus they ex- posed themselves to chess when their brains still had a lot of 'plasticity1 and the chess pat- terns could be near optimally organized. That said, all of our brain mechanisms are highly complicated and the question 'why did I play that move?1 often remains unanswered, even for grandmasters." Thus we have a sort of chess language that provides the detail and subtlety needed to make an over-the-board decision* It also provides the basis for intuitive judgements, which are in- formed by experience and verified by calcu- lation. As Sosonko said: "Behind the word 'in- tuition1 lies our subconscious experience or knowledge of games and ideas, either our own or those of others*1' One way of expressing this is that the master sees before he says, i.e., intu- ition and analysis precede words. For an exam- ple of this that has nothing to do with rules as
12 CHESS STRATEGY IN ACTION
factors like space, outposts, and 'better' minor pieces will always correlate, however mildly, to winning percentage, Rather, I am asking: a) Does a master think in terms of a given rule (and exception) at all? b) Is it even useful to think in those terms when confronted with a specific position? Granted, there are cases in which the sim- plest way to make my argument (and I have oc- casionally done so) is to point out that there are so many exceptions to a particular traditional rule that it becomes meaningless, and so by im- plication the modem player must not be using it. An extreme case is one examined in Chap- ters 1 and 2, where I'm not sure whether the rule 'The player with more space should avoid exchanges (and vice-versa)' is true even 50% of the time! But let's say that figure were 60% or 70%: it would still be terribly limiting to be thinking about a prospective exchange in terms of such a rule. Even when the rule expresses a situation that is true in many more cases than not (e.g., 'a knight on the rim is grim 5), is it con- structive to think in those terms? Or is it better to examine the concrete situation in all of its subtleties, without prejudice, using calculation and pattern recognition as tools? Which does the strong player do? In my observation and from many conversations and analysis with them, grandmasters don't think much in terms of rules and exceptions at all. Indeed, in some cases where they have done so, some quite playable positions have escaped deserved con- sideration because of they 'looked' bad on gen- eral principle. Increasingly, that attitude is being replaced by a pragmatic analytical approach. Other models have been floated to deal with these issues. One such is the idea that rules are valid, 'other things being equal'. 1 won't go into detail here, but the question in practice is whether anyone can decide by explicit means to what extent other factors in a typical middlegame are 'equal'. Since the diverse considerations arc interdependent and also lime-dependent, and since they can be so unbelievably complex, the de termination of what weight to give one ab- stract rule or another seems to me impossible in almost all cases. Then there is the idea of as- sessing and utilizing explicitly identifiable im- balances. But juggling and weighing the many and often subtle imbalances (and anticipated such, take a standard King's Indian Defence, Pirc Defence, or Dragon Sicilian. These all in- volve a kingside fianchetto with ...g6 and ... Ji,g7> Now White often lines up his queen and bishop with d2 and in that case playing Lh6 to exchange bishops on g7 can be good for any number of general reasons, e.g. because Black has subsequent weakness on his dark squares, because White's centre will be pro- tected in the case of an ...exd4 exchange, or be- cause White's potential gain of space after d5 will be more effective. But the move jih6 may equally be bad, e.g., if it allows Black to ex- change off his only bad piece and block the game, or if it diverts White's queen from the action, or if it helps Black to play ...c5 and at- tack a weakened centre. The reality is that such a decision tends to be very subtle, ultimately depending upon a great number of other less obvious factors; e.g., how quickly Black can play ...b5, whether a well-timed ...exd4 fol- lowed by ...c5 or ...Se8 has tactical advantages, whether White's a3 will slow the attack or pro- vide a target, what reorganizations of pieces arc available to both sides, and so forth. From many years of analysing with top players, 1 be- lieve that with the aid of calculation they assess this decision more or less instinctively based upon experience and judgement, without re- sorting to verbal reasoning. Later, the move can be explained to an audience using simplified generalities. But going the other way, from words to move, is extremely unlikely to pro- duce the right decision. And it is particularly hard to act upon raw concepts. For example, one might trade off time or development to se- cure some other positional advantage (an out- post, doubled pawn for the opponent). But one question of many is: how much time/develop- ment can I give up before, e.g., a counterattack becomes a problem? This is solved by some combination of analysis and judgement, and very seldom by abstract reasoning. People commonly interpret what I've said in terms of rules and exceptions, i.e., modem players know the rules and have discovered the exceptions. Or that a player should in fact learn the rules first and then learn their exceptions. But that's not what I'm saying at all. The point is not whether there are X exceptions to every Y instances in which the rule is true. Naturally

new imbalances) which are themselves interde- pendent, all to assess a particular move some- how, is just as complicated as trying to juggle and weigh the influence of rules and generali- ties, The reality is that a strong player is using previous experience and analysis to attend to the specific details of a unique position and to assess its implicit imbalances on some sub- verbal level. The same basic argument applies to the theory that the master is thinking in terms of trading advantages. Can we come up with re- alistic examples of how that might be done? I just don't find any of these models convincing as a reflection of actual thought over the board by even moderately advanced players. Not surprisingly, the idea of playing accord- ing to concrete analysis of the position on the board instead of by rules and principles is not new. In SOMCS, I twice quoted Richard Rdti from Afodfm Ideas in Chess, written in the early 1920s, with respect to the ineffectual ap- plication of 'so-called' rules to a given position. Without doing so again, 1 would bring the last sentence of his exposition to the reader's atten- tion: 'The source of the greatest errors is to be found in those moves that are made merely ac- cording to rule and not based on the individual plan or thought of the player," Going even further back we have this won- derful quote from Mikhail Chigorin, which was brought to my attention by Macon Shibut: T do not consider myself belonging to this or that 'school'; I am guided not by abstract theoreti- cal considerations on the comparative strength of pieces , etc., but only the data as it appears to me in this or that position of the game, which serves as an object of detailed and possibly pre- cise analysis. Each of my moves presents itself as a feasible inference from a series of varia- tions in which theoretical 'principles of play' can have only a very limited significance. ... The ability to combine skilfully, the capacity to find in each given position the most purposeful move, soon leading to the execution of a well- conceived plan, is higher than any principle, or more correct to say, is the only principle in the game of chess which lends itself to precise defi- nition? That's about as accurate a description as can be wished for of the philosophy of the modem analytical school! Richard Forster provides a third example. In a fascinating article about Simon Alapin, Forster presents him as 'more modern than the hypermodems': "Alapin's general attitude is the same throughout: fewer words, but more varia- tions! Whereas Tarrasch, according to Nimzo writsch, presents 'classical' principles, and Nim- zowitsch tries to refute them by his 'modem1 principles, Alapin time and again asks for con- crete moves. He shows how all principles can have only relative validity and are even often contradictory... his refusal of a theoretical bat- tle in terms of abstract principles alone, and his insistence on always examining the position at hand and giving concrete variations, makes him the most progressive of the trio ... Alapin was in fact the one closest to the modem point of view, which values nothing except practical exam- ples and practical success." Of course, such quotes have little to do with the actual practice of chess at these players' respective times. That can only be assessed by examining games and their common character- istics. Rdti, for example, lived in pre-modem times and 1 don't believe that the philosophy expressed by him above had more than Limited influence on his contemporaries; nor did he himself realize how thoroughly the invested in- tellectual tradition in chess would be changed as the years went along. His own play had only certain modem characteristics and I strongly suspect from his notes to games that he would have rejected a great deal of what wc take for granted today. These considerations naturally also apply to the two earlier players. Alapin's play is impressively independent but not al- ways modem in the sense that I have outlined in this book. At any rate, his influence on the chess of his era is not apparent. As for Chigorin, he was a very creative player, but his games show little evidence of a modem attitude towards de- velopment, flank pawn advances, exchange sac- rifices, pawn -chains, backward pawns or any number of other prominent features of modem chess. He was also, as pointed out in SOMCS, wedded to a dogmatic view of knight play. In- terestingly, he has been called an adherent of the Classical School and a disciple of Steinitz (e.g,, by Romanovsky), but also the first 'com- puter player' (Spassky). Ultimately wc must go by the games and to a lesser extent annotations

and articles to form our own judgements about such things. It's not difficult to see that individual state- ments of a philosophy, while they could be in- dicative of changing attitudes in general, are not necessarily so. Rather, ideas (and freedom from the grip of ideas) tend to work their way into the game slowly, traditionally by a player's observation or even imitation of others' new moves and strategies in the same or similar situ- ations, Occasionally there is a wild and unfore- seen breakthrough. But in either case, the new strategies eventually become second nature, so that nearly all strong players and not just a few innovators will partake of this kind of play. Thus I have referred to chess ideas as being in the 'everyday consciousness' of players. With regard to the masters quoted above, this book' s description of how chess is actually played to- day simply doesn't apply to the times in which they lived. And of late, while the traditional process of assimilation is very much alive, it is also being bypassed and accelerated. This is due both to the increasingly pragmatic attitude towards the game and to the fact that players of all ratings have a greatly enhanced ability to ex- periment due to the availability of powerful chess engines. Enough. There is more that I could say about these esoteric topics, but in the final analysis, one can only assess such matters on the basis of practice. It's therefore time to en- ter into the world of modem chess strategy in action.
1 Broader Issues and Their Evolution
1.1 Surrender of the Centre
The phrase 'surrender of the centre' usually re- fers to the classical situation after 1 e4 e5, in which White plays d4 and Black plays ..exd4 rather than trying to protect his e5-pawn. This arises, for example, in Philidor's Defence after
1 c4 e5 2 <16 3 d4 exd4, and in the Ruy
Lopez after 1 c4 e5 2 £Xf3 $V:6 3 Nb5 4 O-O d6 5 d4 _fi.d7 6 $k3 exd4, among other se- quences. Surrender of the centre can also occur when there are pawns on d4 and d5. such that after White's move e4, Black plays ...dxe4 rather than trying to shore up his centre. Nimzowitsch approved of this strategy in the French Defence line 1 e4 e6 2 d4 d5 3 4Bc3 dxe4; and the open- ing that perhaps most successfully employs the surrender of the centre is the Caro-Kann De- fence: 1 e4 c6 2 d4 d5 3 5Bc3 dxe4. In fact, one could argue that the very existence of this last venerable line means that no universal condem- nation of central surrender can be made. Surrender of the centre is closely connected to the topic of space. The side that surrenders the centre gives his opponent influence over five ranks, i.e" he controls only three ranks se- curely, his opponent controls four, and his own fourth rank is disputed territory. For conve- nience, let's call the side that surrenders the centre 'Black* (as is the case in the above exam- ples). In which cases is this justified? How should Black proceed? Which side benefits from exchanges? These issues are treated differently in modem chess from the way they were in classical times. Most significantly, the philoso- phy of when and when not to exchange pieces has changed, and the decision to cede territory to White depends more upon the immediacy of central countcrplay. Surrender in the Double e-Pawn Openings Let's begin with examples of double e-pawn lines involving ...exd4 that were relatively more popular in the 19th and early 20th centuries:
3...exd4 in the Philidor Defence (I e4 e5 2 £tf3
d6 3 d4) and an early ...exd4 in the Ruy Lopez (1 e4 e5 2 4}c6 3 Jlb5 with a later d4). To identify some trends, I will use databases of the top players who were at their best for various epochs, as described in the Preface. The Phili- dor Defence was of course more popular in ear- lier times. Among top players, it was used about twice as often in the 19th century as in 1901- 1935, and about 8 times as often as in later years (it has a small but steady following today, with even top players dabbling occasionally). Ie4e5 2 f3d6 3 d4(D) Black now faces a fundamental choice about whether to surrender the centre with 3...exd4

(or its transpositional equivalent 3...5Bf64 ?k3 exd4) or to support the e5-pawn by, for exam- ple, 3...£rf 6 (3...Qd7 4 J&x4 Be7 seeks to trans- pose via 5 ?k;3 ftgf6, but allows an arguably more effective 5 dxe5) 4 4Bc3 (4 dxe5 Nxe4 is theoretically sound for Black) 4...4ibd71 fol- lowed by "..Ne7 and ...O-O. Black originally played 3...exd4 or 3... f6 4 ?lc3 exd4 with considerable frequency (this ac- counted for almost half of the Philidors among top players in the 19th century), aiming for the following type of position:
3."exd4 4 SW4 Qf6 5 Qc3 Ne7 6 Nc4
This move probably presents Black with the most difficulty, although 6 Bf4 is also popular. After 6 .e2 O-O 7 O-O He8, Black is cramped but has play against White's e-pawn and pros- pects for a timely ...d5.

14 Eadl Qe7 15 Hfel gave White a large ad-
vantage in Lautier-I.Sokolov, Cap d' Agde rpd
1996. 1 think that one will find that with accurate
play by White in the ..xxd4 line with and " Jle7 t Black remains somewhat cramped in a perhaps acceptable position, but one that would attract few top players. Much later, in the 1970s and even up to the early 1990s t some very high-ranked players as Black played 3..xxd4 4 Qxd4 gti, to post the bishop on a more active square than e7 and gain King's Indian-like pressure on the dark squares. That has the drawback of leaving White's cen- tre intact and allowing an attack based upon g4, h4 h5. Yet Black achieves concrete attacking chances on the queen si de. This variation was fi- nally worked out in some detail by means of pretty games, such as the following: Hennigan - Westerinen Gausdal 1995
1 e4 e5 2 Nf3 d6 3 d4 exd4 4 2bcd4 g6 S $5c3
Ag7 6 Ae3 ftf67 Rd2 O-O 8 f3 Qc6 9 g4 Ae6
10 O-O-O (D)
A close look at theory suggests that White keeps a moderate but definite advantage here; and indeed, his results have been good. On his Philidor Defence CD, Bangiev shows that Black fails to equalize after the active attempts 7,..a6 and 7,..c6, and he has difficulties with lack of a target in a line like 7" JIe8 8 ELel .f8 9 a3 (or 9 Ng5 c6 10 a3) 9...Qbd7 10 Na2 ! 4k5 1 1 f3. One should compare such positions with those after ...cxd4 in the Ruy Lopez, analysed in some detail below. There is nothing inevitable about such an assessment, and it may yet be that Black will find some way to get satisfactory play. In general, however, one can see wrhy this kind of set-up has become less popular for Black. It's important that specifics work in addition to the general logic. In this case, White may There are several move-orders that reach (his position. Black still stands worse in the centre, and his only freeing move, 10...d5, will fall short after 11 g5 4Bh5 12 $ xe6 fxc6 13 exd5 exd5 14 ?Axd5. So he exchanges and then launches a dynamic queen side attack, at the

So it shouldn't surprise one that the surren- der of the centre by 3...exd4 has become less appealing for most masters. As a practical mat- ter, one notes that the ...exd4 lines have his- torically scored 61%-39% in White's favour (with equal opposition). Among today's stron- ger players, the 'closed' variation with ...Qbd7, ".Be7, ...O-O (i.e., without ...exd4) is the most popular choice in the Philidor, and among all players it scores about as well as any mainstream black defence. Black is undoubtedly slightly worse, but his position is very flexible and he can play a variety of plans in the centre or on the quecnside. A typical example of the con- temporary strategy is: cost of leaving both the d5-square and the d6- pawn weak:

An interesting example of forced surrender of the centre arises in the Scotch Game: 1 e4 e5 2 £k:6 3 d4 exd4 4 Nxd4. The difference between this and the Philidor Defence is that Black hasn't hemmed in his pieces with ...d6 and is able to play dynamically via 4...$tf6 or
4." Ac5. Peter Wells, who wrote a book on the
Scotch, says H... it is no coincidence that most of Black's main choices in the Scotch are based on a strategy of disruption. Quite simply, other things being equal, the basic 'Scotch centre', a white pawn on e4 vs a black pawn on d6, con- stitutes a spatial plus for White which the de- fender wisely tries to avoid.'' The game he gives, Navara-Kallio, Leon Echt 2001, arose from a Pirc Defence but transposes to our Philidor

There are very many games with the same or a similar black set-up. Thus we can see a theoretical and practical movement away from the ...exd4 strategy in the
18 CHESS STRATEGY IN ACTION
Philidor Defence. In the meantime, top-level practice has shown an increased preference for semi -closed positions that do not surrender the centre (even after moves like ...c6, ...Qc7, and ,"Zc8). This reflects a modem willingness to accept less space and fewer open lines in re- turn for flexibility and more potential dynamic chances. But it's also a purely pragmatic mat- ter. Note that the 3..,exd4 4 ?5xd4 g6 plan above was also revived for the sake of dynamic attacking chances. Had it succeeded in generat- ing sufficient counterplay, no one would be worried about the hypothetical disadvantage of surrendering the centre. As it turns out, the
4...g6 line seems to have narrowly failed in this
precise form, and for concrete reasons. To be sure, this very brief overview of Phili- dor's Defence reveals a trend in a rather obscure opening; but a similar and more pronounced trend can be seen in the most important of dou- ble e-pawn openings: the Ruy Lopez (a.k.a. Spanish (Same) with 1 e4 e5 2 4}f3 3 Bb5, Here the movement away from surrendering the centre in modem practice shares the stage with other elements, including the reduced inclination to exchange pieces. In SOMCS, I made the remark that "the rule which states that 'a player with more space should avoid ex- changes' is so riddled with exceptions as to have lost its usefulness." As with so many guide- lines, I feel that this one is position'specific, as is its complement: a player with Jess space should strive to exchange pieces. Recognizing in which positions one wants to exchange pieces, and which ones to exchange, is a matter of knowledge and experience and is too subtle a decision to be assisted by such general advice. Nevertheless, one sees this rule quoted consis- tently in annotations by grandmasters even to- day, and of course in books on theory. While stated as a general principle, it is frequently conjoined with the historical development of 1 e4 e5 and 1 d4 d5 openings. Therefore it is use- ful to examine the issue in the context of those openings. To examine the connection between space and the surrender of the centre, let's look at a couple of variations that were contested in the latter part of the 19th century through to 1930. The Ruy Lopez with an early surrender of the centre was played by just about all of the leading players of that time period, including Steinitz, Blackbume, Capablanca, Lasker, Alekhine, BogoljuboWj Nimzowitsch, R6ti, Marshall and many others. To illustrate one line, 1 will follow one of the most famous games of chess history: Tarrasch - Em. Lasker Dusseldorf/Munich Wch (4) 1908 I examine this game at length in order to struc- ture the issues involved in the typical early middlegame of the Ruy Lopez ...exd4 lines. Thus the many games in the notes are just as important as the main game. By using them, I hope to give a good indication of why the phi- losophy behind this mode of playing in these particular positions has proven to be a dubious one:
1 e4 e5 2 4ifJ 3 J.b5 d6
Ignoring a few subtleties of move-order,

the actual move-order of Tarrasch-Lasker. In- stead, 3...4Bf6 4 O-O Ae7 5 Hel d6 6 ±xc6+ bxc6 7 d4 exd4 8 jBxd4 Bd7, another example of the ...exd4 structure, resembles various ex amples below. Note that this is a conceptual overview and not a theoretical one.

Of course, 4...exd4 and other variations with an early ...exd4 were also played at the time. 54k3 f6 The characteristic drawbacks of exchang- ing via 5...?lge7 and 6...Nxd4 were shown in Em.Lasker-Stcinitz, New York Wch (1) 1894:

Instead. Lasker in his 'Manual' suggested that 8...Bd7 was equal, giving 9 h3 -Ne7 10 _fi.e3 O-O. How- ever, White can get some advantage by several means, including the plan of b3 and .b2 as shown in the note to 7 Zcl. Tarrasch was ultimately vindicated in his dis- trust of the ".exd4 lines, and in this same 1908 world championship match, he again demon- strated his prescience by twice playing (as Black) the modern 'closed1 concept with 3 Bb5 a6 4 Na4 5tf6 5 O-O Ne7 6 Bel b5 7 _fcb3 d6 followed by ...5Ba5 and...c5. One could say that Tarrasch was the most clear-headed about the theory of these Ruy Lopez positions; but his match loss to Lasker obscured that reality. Was Tarrasch's dogmatic stance against the surren- der of the centre thus an example of the triumph of general principles? Not at all. What did prove true is that the surrender of the centre was eventually shown to be unjustified (or at least too great a disadvantage to cope with in prac- tice) in some very specific positions. But one cannot say this in general; as we shall see, a cor- rect assessment requires the same case-by-casc determination that applies with respect to any question about space, development, and central control.

is one of many possibilities for Black to go wrong. 16<ad4ac5!?fD) A position typical of the variation: Lasker never seemed too concerned about White's space advantage, since he felt that White didn't have enough pieces to take advantage of it be- fore Black could reorganize (and perhaps even exchange into an ending). But I don't think that any modem player would want to get near this position the simplification has made White's plans too easy to implement!

One would guess that Tarrasch expected something like 15..jNf8 and planned 16 £ki4 with growing pressure. Lasker knew that his best chance to avoid a long, maybe painful de- fence was to take Tarrasch out of his confident mood by doing something very provocative (on the chess board, of course!). And so he moves his rook contrary to all rules of conventional wisdom:" 15"Jk51?!? Or perhaps *!!' for ingenuity. But objec- tively Kasparov's '?!' is probably more accu- rate.

One is reminded of the rook moves along ranks that are featured in the present volume (and in SOMCS).

For one thing, the top play- ers of the last 7(1 years or so, including most world champions and elite players, established the superiority of playing certain closed varia- tions with ...d6 and making the c5-pawn a pro- tected strongpoint (superiority in the broader sense of achieving good results, as well as in the theoretical sense). But surely the great play- ers of the late 19th and early 20th centuries had time and experience enough with this opening to come to the same conclusion? I think that there are several reasons that this took so long to happen, but one of them has to do with a philosophical notion that began to take over, i.e., one should only try to equalize or perhaps accept a small disadvantage with Black regard- less of the dynamic chances one might forego thereby. It is true that the further back we go into the 19th century, the more outrageous were the swashbuckling attempts by Black to impose almost irrational dynamism into the play, in part with White's cooperation. One thinks of the way players treated the Evans Gambit, King's Gambit, Bishop's Gambit, Philidor Counter- gambit and others. However, with the arrival of Steinitz and the top-level adoption of his ratio- nal approach to chess, the leading players be- gan to play less ambitiously in the opening and early middlegame, the Ruy Lopez positions be- ing in the forefront of those which they treated in this manner. A second and related factor in the popularity of surrendering the centre was seen repeatedly in the games above: the limited idea that the side with less space could exchange pieces and render White's space advantage

academic. What was not appreciated at the time and became obvious later was the large number of positions in which such exchanges actually increased White's advantage. Let's look at some general figures about the surrender of the centre in both the Ruy Lopez and in the Philidor Defence. Here I am using databases including only the top players for each era. I have included cases of ...exd4 at an early stage in the Ruy Lopez while excluding lines involving c3 for White or ...exd4 exchanges such as occur in irrelevant or forcing situations like 1 e4 e5 2 Qf3 £k6 3 Jtb5 a6 and now 4 Ba4 f5 5 d4 exd4 or here 4 jNxc6 dxc6 5 d4 exd4. Combining the instances of a relevant ...exd4 in the Philidor and in the Ruy Lopez, we can compare the total number of those games as a percentage of the total of all games played in the two openings. Notice that this percentage will never be very high, because the latter total includes all sorts of Ruy Lopez favourites such as the Open VariabuiL, the Berlin Defence, the Marshall Attack, and a very wide variety of closed systems such as the very main lines. One should also remember that an early d3 in the Ruy Lopez was quite popular in the classical period, following Steinitz's lead. Obviously, Black never has the option of ..xxd4 in these cases. Nevertheless, by examining the figures, we find that the leading playcra of the period from 1900 and before chose a variation with ...exd4 in about 13% of all Philidor and Ruy Lopez games. During 1901-35, that figure rose to almost 16%. But from 1936-70, these ...cxd4 systems were used only 3% of the time, a ratio that modestly declined to about 2.3% in 1985- 2002, and even then only because the small number of those ...g6 Philidor's Defences men- tioned above contributed almost half of the ,,.exd4 examples! Nor do such figures merely reflect some sort of increase in irregular variations of the Ruy Lopez (and thus a skewing of percentages). Let us count only the current main line beginning with 3 £b 5 a6 4 Na4 fcf6 5 O-O Ae7 6 Eel b5 7 Bb3 d6 (D). We find that it was played in approximately
1.5% of top-level Ruy Lopez games before
1900, 10.5% during 1900-1935 (mostly toward the end), 41.2% during 1936-70, and 37.7% during 197 1-2002. In other words, modem play has seen a radical shift to closed or semi -closed variations. I think that ultimately the world-class play- ers concluded that these lines with ...exd4 were just too onerous and unrewarding. The 'surren- der the centre and exchange pieces1 approach was often even worse than the 'surrender the centre and batten down the hatches' approach, which at least made matters complicated and won some points. By the 1930s, after four de- cades of top-level use, other variations of the Ruy 1jopez took over, and in the 1985-2002 da- tabase, for example, top players used a conven- tional ...d6 and early ."exd4 system in only 26 of 1,658 Ruy Lopez games. Yes, Lasker had managed to win some big-time contests with this strategy, but hardly due to rhe openings or middlegame structures. He also played the white side of these lines with pleasure and did very well against them. In any case, if you compare the ",cxd4 Ruy Lopez lines with other 'surren- der the centre' efforts (more to come), you see that they are similar in this respect, that is, in most cases Black's task is not eased by ex- changes. And yet in the Ruy Lopez it is hard to do without them. In the type of cramped position that Black gets, with a few exceptions, his pieces don't have the dynamic potential that one sees in, say, the Hedgehog formations with ...cxd4, the King's Indian Defence lines with ...exd41 or the French Defence variations with ,,,dxe4. In the Ruy Lopez, Black's pawns are seldom threats to challenge White's centre as they are in those openings. Granted, the ...exd4 Ruy Lopez variations cannot be considered refuted; but very few players would want to take on the extended defensive task and lack of counterchanccs.
SURRENDER OF THE CENTRE 2S
What then are the preferred modem ap- proaches to the Ruy Lopez? Does Black aim for a closed position, as we suggested was the most successful Philidor Defence strategy? Of course that is the strategy involved in the main lines; for example* the Chigorin, Smyslov, Zait- sev, and Breyer variations. But modem players are more pragmatic than this: essentially, the philosophy is 'play what works', including both closed and open variations. Consider the extremely popular and effective Marshall At- tack: 3 Nb5 a6 4 Na4 Q f6 5 O-O Ne7 6 ficl b5
7 Nb3 O-O 8 c3 d5 9 exd5 Qxd5 10 GixeS 21xe5
1 1 Hxe5 c6" This dynamic variation was con- sidered rather marginal until it became clear that Black needn't prosecute his attack to check- mate if he was to avoid losing some pawn-down endgame. Instead, 8*.,d5 began to be used as a long-term positional pawn sacrifice, as is so common in modem chess (see Chapter 2 for other examples). Black also plays dynamically in the Arkhangelsk Variation, Open Defence, and other lines. Examples in the King's Indian Defence Returning to our topic, the surrender of the centre and exchanges, we find that the double e-pawn cases do not indicate a general philo- sophical shift that extends throughout chess thought. Instead, players decide on a casc-by- case basis, using concrete analysis and prag- matic considerations as their criteria. Before turning to examples involving ...dxe4, let's look at another example of ...exd4, but this time aris- ing from the King's Indian Defence. The fol- lowing game provides a contemporary example of surrendering the centre: Whiteley - Gallagher Royan 1989

6 O-O Qbd7 7 eS 8 e4 (D)
8...exd4
Black also plays ...c6 here or on the next few moves, thinking about ...exd4in the near future. An example of this is 8...c6 9 h3 Qb6 10 Hel exd4. In such a position he will intentionally deploy his forces to avoid exchanging them. True, if he could ever achieve ...d5, it would tend to clear out the middle of the board, ex- change pieces and equalize. But in choosing this kind of structure, both sides know that White can prevent that break with any type of reasonable play. Then Black has a cramped po- sition, but his chances will lie in dynamic elas- ticity and not simplification. See the next game for a fine example of strategic manoeuvring in a similar context 9SW4 HeBfDJ In this characteristic position, White has the move c4 in, which by comparison with the 1 e4 e5 examples above, further discourages ...d5 and ...b5. On the other hand, this also loosens the dark squares that Black's g7 -bishop aims at and it weakens d3, a factor which seems irrele- vant but will sometimes enter into play much later, 10 h3

Nb2 29 Rd2 Gk4 30 Itfd3 Qb2 31 Rd2 2k4 V2-V2 The surrender of the centre was reasonable in this game due to dynamic play and the per- sistent threat of freeing moves for Black, some- thing missing in the foregoing Philidor and Ruy Lopez examples. As noted in the games above, Black would actually hurt his chances for activity by early exchanges. But once again, the precise verdict varies upon piece placement. For example, if White plays the main line of the King's Indian with I d4 2 c4 g6 3 ?Jc3 ig? 4 e4 d6 5 Qf3 O-O 6 Jle2 e5 7 O-O, then according to theory neither lines with 7...exd4 8 Qxd4 ?3c6, nor 7.,,Qbd7 and an early ...exd4 achieve full equality. Perhaps more importantly, Black of- ten can't avoid early exchanges in these lines and isn't able to create the continued threat of credible game-freeing pawn breaks.

Notice that if White has to keep an eye on such moves as well as potential central breaks, his pieces tend to be very tied down to their posts, compensating Black for the fact that his own pieces are cramped from lack of space. This kind of dynamic balance in an elastic posi- tion is very similar to what happens in the mod- em 'hedgehog' structures that arise in many of the positions of the English Opening and the Si- cilian and Modem Defences, among others.

Before continuing, let's look at some histori- cal trends. In the period 1900-1935, the leading players chose ".dxe4 on the 3rd and 4th moves in 26% of the French Defence games in which they had a chance to do so (i.e., games with 3 5\i2 and 3 Sc3 rather than 3 exd5, 3 e5, 2 d3, etc.). This reflected a friendly attitude towards the surrender of the centre, as we saw in the Philidor and Ruy Lopez. As time went on, how- ever, the idea became less popular for all the classical reasons: lack of space and freedom for Black's pieces. In the period 1936-1970, with the rise of the Winawer and Tarrasch Variations with 3 Qd2 ?Bf6 or 3 ftd2 c5, the same figure- plummeted to 12%, But from 1985 to 2002, leading players, given the opportunity, reversed course and chose 3...dxe4 or 4...dxe4 in 21% of the relevant French Defence games. While this is still not a structure that French players absolutely rush into, such a degree of willingness by strong players to surrender the centre hasn't been seen for some time. What has happened, and what are the characteristics of the resulting positions? The first consider- ation we must deal with is Black's c8-bishop, which will need to be developed. In a manner analogous to the ."exd4 lines after 1 e4 e5, in which Black seldom achieves ,"d5, Black will seldom be able to achieve ...e5 and free his queen's bishop. So to avoid the fate of passivity resulting from being stuck behind the e6-pawn, the c8-bish op will often have to be developed to b7 after ...b6, or to c6 via d7. This costs time, and the plan to go to b7 is sometimes not A fully pragmatic approach involving tak- ing on the isolated pawn and fianchettoing a knight in order to return it to the centre. White is probably better in this position, but it hasn't been proven yet. In the game, Black is prepared to cede the bishop-pair in order to get two cen- tral pawns:

Old and New: Central Capitulation in the French Defence We have seen the surrender of the centre in the context of the passive Ruy Lopez variations and the wild King's Indian Defence variations. The move ...dxe4 in the French Defence provides us with an up-to-date field test for the surrender of the centre in a middle-of-the-road setting, i.e. sound but not too ambitious. Grandmasters and international masters have revived the use of the variations 1 e4 e6 2 d4 d5 3 ?k3 dxe4 (or 3 dxe4) 4 xe4 (DJ and 1 e4 e6 2 d4 d5 3

practicable due to moves like and J$.b5+ on White's part. Nevertheless, most of the time Black does succeed in activating this bishop within the next 6-8 moves.

Of course, that can change: after all, Anand, Barcev, and M.Gure- vich arc not bad ambassadors for 3...dxc4 4 Nd7! The point is that variations which involve the same pawn-structure and associ- ated issues may nevertheless result in different assessments. 4 jLgS dxe4 5 Nxe4 -fix7 6 jLxfti Jtxf6 7

That move can be enforced by means of a knight on d7 and a bishop on f8 or e7. There is no real parallel to this in the ...exd4 lines stem- ming from 1 e4 e5, because the move ...f5 is blocked by a knight on f6; even were it achieved it would merely weaken the black king's pro- tection and the e6-square. Lf Black can succeed in playing ...c5 and ei- ther isolate or liquidate White's d-pawn, then the whole scheme begins to look more feasible. I think that it's fair to say that the modem treat- ment of ...dxe4 is more aggressive than in the early part of the last century. Very seldom are top players content to combine moves like ...b6, ..x6, ".Ji.b7, ."4?c7t and ."Qd7 before embark- ing upon central action. Now Black feels that he requires counterplay via the freeing moves ...c5 or ...e5, or by obtaining the two bishops (fol- lowing JlgSxfG, for example). Otherwise, once White consolidates his space advantage the play begins to resemble that of the ...exd4 Philidors and Ruys. Let's take a look at some concrete examples.
1 e4 e6 2 d4 d5 3 <ftc3 £16
Not surprisingly, the viability of the ...dxe4 idea is a matter of specifics rather than general philosophy. For example, 3 £k:3 (or 3 £k!2) 3,..dxe44 Nxe4 5k!?, the Rubinstein Variation, hasn't been quite as successful over the past few Here we have a fascinating example of sym- metry with the Ruy Lopez variation 3.. .d6 4 d4 iLd7 (the 'exact' analogy would be 4...exd4 5 Nxd4 Ad7 6 Axcb Bxc6) 5 £te3 6 Bxc6 jLxcft 7 Ud3 exd4 8 £ xd4. Why should this French instantiation be any more attractive for Black than that one? The answer lies mainly in precise moves and their playability rather than in general considerations. For example, let's go back to the note to 6 O-O in Laskcr-Tanasch above. After 8 Nxd4, the move that Black would most like to play is the active 8...g6 (instead of the passive 8....fix7). I think that it's fair to say that a plan involving ...Jtg7, ...O-O, and ...fic8 would give him fully satisfactory play. But as we saw in that note, 8..,g6? fails tactically. Now compare the (diagrammed) French Defence po- sition. Black will generally succeed in playing ...b6 and ..jSLb7, putting pressure on White's centre from both long diagonals. This has the further consequence that ...Qd7 can be played, both defending f6 and preparing ...c5.

The line 3 $Sc3 £}f6 4 iLg5 dxe4 is popular at this time, and I think for some good reasons. Systems with ...gxf6 (after, say, 5 Qxe4 Jte7 6 Nxf6) have led to dynamic and fun games, but not always so successfully for Black. Instead,
6...Nxf6 plans a set-up like ...£ki7 and ...c5

Of course, White has more space and freer, more rapid development; these arc characteristics of openings in which the opponent has surrendered the centre. It would be surprising if White wasn't a bit better, but
SURRENDER OE THE CENTRE 35
perhaps no more than in any other opening. The difference between White's strategies and suc- cess versus 3,.,dxe4 as opposed to 3-?Bf6 4 -£ug5 dxe4 indicates that the specific implemen- tation of both sides' ideas is more important than a general philosophy about central struc- tures. The surrender of the centre has been our topic in this chapter, with an emphasis on its historical development and its relationship to the issues of space and exchanges. What can we conclude about this strategy? Above all, that its value varies from case to case. Small dif- ferences in piece placement and timing make a world of difference in the resulting assess- ments. Looking back upon the surrender of the centre via ,"exd4 in the Philldor Defence and the Ruy Lopez, we can see that it enjoyed great popularity in both openings in the late 19th and early part of the 20th century, but then its status declined dramatically after it was found that White's space advantage was hard to contend against, and that exchanges tended to be of little or no value to the defender. By contrast, the mirror image lines of the French Defence are very popular today for a variety of reasons in- cluding the possibility of attacking the centre by ,..c5 and the availability of a queenside fian- chetto. Finally, a very different type of surren- der of the centre was examined in the King's Indian Defence, where dynamism is the key in- gredient in Black's strategy, so exchanges are therefore avoided by Black These three dis- similar examples show that generalities do not apply well to this strategy. But the investigation has given us insights into the issue of space and exchanges, to which we turn next.
1.2 Space, Centre, and Exchanging
on Principle c5, the strange-looking 9 Be5 ? Jkf6 10 Nxb8! ILxb8 11 g5 Ae7 12 jLg2 shows White's will- ingness to exchange pieces in positions where Black is cramped, even at the cost of ceding his two bishops. This continuation is seen in Part 2 in the game Daurov-Lputian, Istanbul OL 2000. 4 ±g5 Ne7 5 e3 O-O 6 ftf3 (D) We continue our discussion of space and the centre, emphasizing the exchange of pieces, a topic which is conveniently amenable to direct comparisons from position to position. It takes exemplary games with modem openings to throw the issues of space and exchanges into stark relief, since one side (usually Black) very often stakes out relatively less claim to the cen- tre, especially in terms of occupation by pawns. But I'll first continue from the last chapter with our examination of less radical examples from classical chess. The 1 e4 c5 and 1 d4 d5 open- ings are not clear-cut in regard to the issue of space, because their initial purpose is to estab- lish a centre pawn on the fourth rank and thus an equal share of territory. Nevertheless, even if Black doesn't surrender the centre in the man- ner shown in the last section, the relative share of space can still become imbalanced in White's favour and has traditionally been met by a phi- losophy of exchanges by the weaker side. This is generally the case in the early middlegame of the orthodox lines of the Queen's Gambit Declined with ...c6 ( 1 d4 d5 2 c4 c6), and it is very instruc- tive to see how these lines have evolved and been reassessed. Let's consider, for example, the cur- rent status of some of the very oldest main lines of that opening. Despite its appearance, this will not be a theoretical survey and shouldn't be treated as such. Rather, I am trying to present a series of illustrations of why modern attitudes have changed towards this kind of position: Space and Exchanges in the Queen's Gambit

At this point, Tsesamky gives the following convincing anal- ysis: 19 h4! Rb4 (19...h6 20 h5 Ah7 21 Rg4 g6 22 hxg6 fxg6 23 4\xg6 and White wins) 20 Edl \c7 21 h5 and apart from other moves White has 22 Eg5! g6 23 hxg6 hxg6 24 Exf5! ?Axf5 (24".gxf5 25 >g3+, etc.) 25 Qxg6, win- ning, Fun stuff. We now return to 1 1 45e4 (D): tries to exchange two sets of pieces followed by a central break, i.e. ...e5, to free his queen's bishop and his game. This is the same pattern that we shall see in the next game, via 6...h6 7 ji.h4 Qe4 (Lasker's Defence). The philosophy bears some resemblance to the traditional rec- ipe in the ...exd4 positions we saw in the last section. This move at first seems to be avoiding ex- changes, but actually just angles for a different set of exchanges in order to achieve the better endgame. In fact, 11 4ftc4 is probably even more damning evidence against Capablanca's line than the more common 1 1 (TO, because Black's counterchances are virtually nil after 11 4&e4, Nevertheless, 11 O-O has also discour- aged players from entering this line as Black: 1 l...Nxc3 12 Bxc3 e5 (all according to plan; as noted below, this position can also arise, with ...h6 and Jlh4 having been interpolated, in Las- ker's Defence) 13 JsLb3 exd4 (another possibil- ity is 13...Be8 14dxe5Qxe5 1 5 51xe5 Qxe5 16 f4 intending f5 t when Black's game is truly cramped) 14 exd4 (D). This is a well-known IQP position where even a glance shows that White has a nice attack, since he has much better development with Eel coming, and the c3-rook is ready to swing to- wards the kingside. This doesn't mean that a very strong player couldn't defend the position with perfect play, just that very few would con- sider that a good bargain.

For many years, nearly every student would absorb the theoretical main lines as illustrative of White's initial space advantage and Black's subsequent liberation by freeing moves, achieving an equal game. But to a large extent, Black's dream of equality has turned out to be an illusion. As we shall see below, the Capablanca Variation is fast disappearing in top-level play. In my database, games with the move 14 e4 as played above have scored 79% for White with a 2796 perfor- mance rating for White versus a miserable 1940 for Black! Next we look at the other renowned classical solution to the Queen's Gambit: 1 d4d5 2c4e63 4k3ftf6 4 Bg5 Ne7 5e3 O-O 6 S\f3 h6 The move 6...4Be4 resembles what follows, and was more popular than 6".h67 Jlh4Qe4in the early 1900s, but was ultimately discarded because of lines in which White would gain a tempo by attacking the h7-pawm 7 lh4 4W (D) middlegame since. White has a space advan- tage, dark squares, and a centralized king while Black still has the passive bishop on c8. 12 ftxf6+ 'ffxffi 13 O-O e5 (D) Black has now staked out a claim to the cen- tre and freed a path for his previously miserable cS-bishop. Now 14 Bb3 exd4 35 Rxd4 Qxd4 16 xd4 gives White some advantage with his freer development and more mobile majority, but Black's position is difficult to crack and with care he may unravel his forces. Instead, a recent game is an example of the more direct approach that emphasizes White's space advantage: Ata lik - Zheliandinov Podlehnik 2001 14 e4! exd4 15 Rxd4 %Fxd4 16 ?lxd4 e5 17 iJb3Hd8 18HfdlJtd7 Apart from having to watch for White's ad- vancing central pawns, Black's problem is that there are few active squares for his pieces. 19 f4!

a simplifying strategy. In fact, such a sequence of exchanges came very close to levelling the game. The point is that one cannot reliably pre- dict whether exchanges will help the side with less space to equalize or the player with more space to maintain an advantage. These are posi- tion-specific decisions that cannot be made on the basis of principle. Let's next turn to the so- lution that has replaced the lines above in mod- em players' favour lllescas 'Short Pamplona 1999/00 ld4 dS 2 c4 e6 3 Q c3 <£rf6 4 Ng5 Jke7 5 e3 O-O 6<Bf3 h6 Just as 6".?k4 was much more popular than

6.. .b6 rather than 6... h6 7 Bh4b6. By the 1930s
and since then, 6..T6 7 Jkh4 b6 has taken over (it prevents a tempo-gain on h7 in some lines), and it is played in at least 50 times as many high-level games today. 7_fi.h4b6(7JJ problems than in those lines. But he does have a cramped game, and by putting the bishop on the active long diagonal while reserving d7 for his knight, he follows a similar recipe to that of the
3 Qc3 Qf6 4 Bg5 dxe4 French. Even the king's
bishop may achieve activity along the h8-al di- agonal, as also occurs in the French variation, if White chooses to play Bxf6. Black' s closed so- lution, with no rush to exchange anything, has become by far the most popular choice in the juncture following 6 Qf3 among leading mas- ters. Among its many adherents have been world champions Petrosian ( Spassky, Karpov, Kasparov, and Kramnik, while players such as Beliavsky and Short use the Tartakower regu- larly and successfully. See also the figures be- low regarding its popularity. It has been so successful that it has chased White into in- creased use of the Exchange Variation (3 4k3 and 4 cxd5), if 4 systems, and the Catalan Sys- tem with g3. Indeed, the Exchange Variation now outnumbers the Lasker, Capablanca, and T artakower lines combined by well over 2 to 1 ! On a practical level, Black retains more win- ning opportunities after 7,..b6 by virtue of keeping more pieces on the board. It's true that White can himself force simplification by 8 cxd5 #Axd5 9 Bxe7, etc., but this has now been shown to be thoroughly harmless, and at the top level it is played almost exclusively by the peaceably minded; even then, Black wins his share of games. So let's look at some modem interpretations of the Tartakower in practice, again understanding that this is by no means a theoretical overview: 8Ne2 A recent example that reached the same type of position went 8 \Sfb3 J b7 9 _fi.xf6 J xffi 10 cxd5 ex±5 11 Hdl Se8 12 .d3 (D).

And yet, consider that White retreated this bishop two moves ago only to ex- change it at loss of tempo now ! Furthermore, he cedes the two bishops in what doesn't look like a very closed position. The idea is that Black's bishop is in some ways worse on b7 than it was on c 8 ! This modem, paradoxical solution came into its own in the 1970s and remains White's most popular approach to the Tartakower. Incidentally, notice that there is no further exchange of pieces until move 21 of this game, nor until move 21 in the next game! Further- more, in the Karpov-Ki.Georgiev game note on pages 42-3, you will see that the first piece is 'exchanged' on move 29 as part of the conclud- ing combination. Dynamism and maintenance of tension in the position characterize the mod- em Tartakower QGD.

By contrast with the Mitkov game (note la' to White's Sth move), White is playing slowly and isn't preparing to open things up in either the centre or on the queenside, This is not terri- ble, but as discussed in SOMCS, time tends to favour the bishop-pair, since once Black catches up in development and reorganizes, he can him- self open the position.

The overall trends in this main line of the Queen's Gambit Declined can be clarified by examining some statistics.

7.. .b6 reflects only the advancement of con-
crete theory and no philosophical change. Oth- erwise, for example, one might think that the Tartakower idea was hardly played until the post-193 5 period, which would be very mis- leading. Historical usage of these variations demon- strates the change in attitude towards them. In each case I will take percentages out of a total of QGDs with Bg5 (representing a wide variety of black defences, so much of the game space is not filled by our particular lines). As before, I will first use the databases of the world's lead- ing players in the time periods given. Although the figures that follow are slightly biased by the difficulty of separating out a given player's practice over decades in which he was not as dominant, the relative figures should be indica- tive anyway. For leading players whose peak playing pe- riod was 1901-35, Lasker's Defence was used in 5.3% of their jNg5 games, the Capablanca Variation in 10.6%, and the Tartakower (mainly
6...b6) in 12%.
For the period 1936-70, the Lasker figure goes to 11%, the Capablanca to 6.3%, and the Tartakower (almost all 7...b6) to 26%. It should be noted that I have not always split up the games of players whose play overlaps less dra- matically into two periods, so in this case there is a moderate overstatement of the Tartakower figures. Still, a big leap in its use began in the 1960s. In 1971-2002, high-level use of Lasker's De- fence was 6%, the Capablanca dropped to only 1 .6%, and the Tartakower Defence's popularity skyrocketed to 40%. So we see that the Lasker and Capablanca variations have been to a large extent super- seded by the Tartakower, in which Black keeps the pieces on the board rather than seeking ex- changes. On the other hand, I was surprised to see that the Tartakower idea was fairly popular even going back into the 19th century (with
6.. .b6). This indicates that certain leading play-
ers at that time were willing to fianchetto their bishop (something that was still rare relative to modern times), and that they must have appre- ciated the greater scope for play this strategy af- forded. Also noteworthy is that the Tartakower Defence proper (with 6...h6 7 Ah4 b6) clearly outperformed the Lasker and Capablanca vari- ations in every time period. Over the last 30 years, it has scored almost exactly 50% as Black, with a dead heat in performance ratings. By contrast, the Lasker and Capablanca have done miserably; amazingly, Black hasn't scored a single win out of the 69 Lasker Defences in the 1971-2002 database of top masters! While the players split the point 46 times, it seems that Black can hardly hope for winning chances versus leading players in this line. Hedgehogs and their Territoriality The examples above are all based upon classi- cal pawn-structures. In modem times, we find that the growing acceptance of openings that claim less space provides us with many illustra- tions of the flexibility that has arisen with re- spect to exchanges. In the theory of almost any opening we encounter examples of the side with less space seeking exchanges or avoiding them, depending upon concrete situations. The same applies to the player who controls more space, I will extend the discussion that I began in SOMCS of the structure that most cleanly il- lustrates this. So-called 'Hedgehog' structures are charac- terized by black pawns on a6, b6, d6, and e6 with his c-pawn off the board, a sample skeletal structure being: The white c-pawn can also be on c2 (as in the Sicilian Defence).

An elaborate move designed to prevent the exchange of pieces that White now aims for. lL..Rc8!? is also played with the same pur- pose.

Hedgehog positions arise in many variations of the English Opening and still more in Sicil- ian Defences. For example, Frank Zeller's Sizi- lianisch im Geiste des Igels (*Thc Sicilian in the Spirit of the Hedgehog') provides a fascinating survey of a host of regular and irregular Hedge- hog variants in the Sicilian (at least 30 inde- pendent ones!). I don't want to overdescribc the characteristics of this structure, which is cov- ered in SOMCS, nor belabour the now-conven- tional point that Hedgehog positions exemplify a conceptual change in the attitude towards space, dynamism, and elasticity in modem chess. But by looking at some practical examples I hope to extend our discussion of the main theme of this chapter, that of exchanges in the context of space. The 'original* Hedgehog move-order (i.e., from which it got its name) arises from the Eng- lish Opening. Here is a well-known game (at least to those of my generation !) demonstrating both sides* strategy: Polugaevsky - FtaCnik Lucerne OL 1982 1 5 f3 Qf6 2 c4 c5 3 Nc3 e6 4 g3 b6 5 igl i.b7 6 O-O Jke7 7 d4 cxd4 8 Rxd4 (D) After 8 Qxd4 Axg2 9 't ?xg2, Black has dem- onstrated that plans like ...ltfc8 and (to exchange another piece) as wel] as those with ...a6 and ...d6 equalize easily.

This is a black set-up which can be virtually defined in terms of White's spatial plus, but as we look at the evolution of White's strategy a very surprising development occurs. Respect for the flexibility of Black's passive pieces grows, and al the same time a number of White's more chal- lenging attempts to demonstrate a plus involve White initiating simplification (!) - either the exchange of queens or at least a pair of minor pieces Interesting is Igor Stohl's take on this issue [that] 'without the queens on the board White often has more chances to advance his pawns on both flanks, thus emphasizing his space advantage without having to think about a devastating counterattack/ " The latter com- ment would apply, for example, to the Ribli- Ambroz example in the notes to the previous game. ll,"Sa7 A multi-purpose move.

exchanges that would reduce his counterplay', or anything similar. Yet in most of the games and notes above, we have seen exchanges fa- vouring the side with more space. That is not to say that there aren't also plenty of examples that support the conventional wisdom. The point is that no generality can be applied. An example of this attitude appears in Dvor- etsky's book School of Excellence 3: Strategic Play. The author, a favourite of mine, is one of the most insightful of theoreticians when writ- ing about opening and middlegame strategy. Nevertheless, even he is subject to classical oversimpEfication and, I think, errors about various old saws that we all grew up with. In his chapter on 'Advantage in Space', he advocates the classical notion: 'The side who has an ad- vantage in space can freely manoeuvre with his pieces, switching them from flank to flank, whereas his opponent often lacks scope for ma- noeuvring, and his pieces hinder one another. From this it is clear that, if you have an advan- tage in space, it is advantageous to retain as many pieces as possible, whereas in a cramped position, by contrast, you should aim for ex- changes", soon adding "All these consider- ations are fairly obvious " But he then adds scant evidence favouring, and some contradict- ing, his own thesis, Dvoretsky gives a single game in which Black has surrendered the centre in a Pirc Defence resulting in a position struc- turally similar to those in the first chapter of this book. He criticizes Black, who has less space, for failing to exchange pieces and then White for encouraging exchanges on the very next move. Dvoretsky calls this "an astounding strategic mistake". That it is a mistake is clear, although White probably just missed the move sequence that followed the exchange and thus invalidated it. Be that as it may, one is left won- dering whether this example by itself is meant to justify the broad claim quoted above. After all, we have seen many counter-examples, par- ticularly in this type of pawn-structure. The ob- vious problem with Dvoretsky's reasoning is that exchanges may simplify the task of the side with space, whose pieces are still more easily transferred from flank to flank, in some cases with greater or decisive effect. In Dvoretsky's next few examples, the issue of exchanging to free a cramped game isn't essentially invol veil. move, and shows again that then: arc no simple rules) 16...Hcc8 17 Qc2 £fc5 18 £fc3! and White is ready to play ?Jed5 with a standard ad- vantage.

On the other hand, I haven't seen the annotation 'Possessing more space, I sought simplifica- tion' or 'Confined to three ranks, Black avoids

since Black exchanges his bishop for a knight in order to create doubled pawns in White's po- sition. That manoeuvre by no means frees his game, but has the usual effect of creating weak- nesses and locking the pawn-structure to such an extent that White's bishop-pair is restricted and he can't make progress. Two draws result This is followed by a game in which one side attempts to exchange his bad dark-squared bi shop but lands in trouble, not a relevant test of the issue under question. Finally, in the last game in which exchanging is a theme, Dvor- etsky shows White, with a huge advantage in space, avoiding an exchange; but he suggests that exchanging a piece at that point was a good option (it in fact looks better), in spite of his principle. Then a few moves later he finds that White definitely should have exchanged pieces rather than avoiding an exchange! This was not a grave error, and White's position remained very strong, but what became of the principle? To say the least, these examples provide only the thinnest of support to Dvoretsky's thesis. 1 think his presentation provides a good exam- ple of how a writer wedded to a lifelong con- ception can he blind to actual evidence one way or another. (Of course, that criticism ap- plies to most writers, including the author of these lines.) To conclude this discussion, I would like to talk in broad terms about a few contemporary pawn formations and get a feel for the philoso- phies of exchanging that seem to apply. Continuing with the Symmetrical English Opening, one sees that both approaches apply depending upon the specifics. For example, as I was writing this I ran across the position after 1 c4c5 2Qf3 Qc6 3g3 g6 4 Ng2 Bg7 5 CM3 e5 6 Nc3 d6 7 d3 Qge7 8 a3 a5 9 ftel Ne6 10 ?fc2 d5 11 cxd5 Qxd5 12&e3 (D). This is from Smirin-Kariakin, Moscow 2002; the same type of middlegame has occurred in several forms and in particular with colours re- versed. Black played 12..J&de7!, when Kristen says: 'Thematic; Black avoids exchanges when he has extra space." He is right, and White tends to be a little worse in such positions. But in the similar traditional line with 1 c4 c5 2 ?Bc3 Qc6
3 g3 g6 4 Ag2 Jkg7 5 Bf3 " f6 6 04) O-O 7 d4
cxd4 8 Qxd4, there are many cases in which the side with greater space should encourage exchanges; for example, 8...4fa5 9 5k2 d6 10 jNd2"fh5 lle4'Wxdl 12Haxdl and White is better. Let's turn to the Indian Systems with 1 d4 4Bf6 2 c4. In the Nimzo- and Queen's-Indian Defences following 2"x6, we often see an early simplifying ."Qe4 move to good effect, e.g. 3 2rf3 b6 4 g3 Nb7 5 ±g2 ±e7 6 O-O O-O 7 Qc4 or 3 4hc3 Lb4 4 c3 b6 5 4?k2 By contrast, Black is much less inclined to ex- change pieces in King's Indian positions after 1 d4 $3f6 2 c4 g6 3 #3c3 jig 7 4 e4 d6 5 #}f3 O-O, particularly when Black plays ,..e5 and White plays d5. This is simply because White's extra space tends to give him superior endings, and exchanges can also reduce the risk from a king- side attack by Black. In the main line of the Griinfcld Defence (an- other Indian System) consisting of 1 d4 2 c4 g6 3 ffk3 d5 4 cxd5 Qxd5 5 e4 Qxc3 6 bxc3 Jlg7, one can find many instances of simplifi- cation aiding one side or the other; e.g., Black because he wins queenside squares or White because his centre can become so powerful in an ending. As for 1 d4 d5, we have seen the am- biguity of exchanges in the Orthodox Queen's Gambit Declined; but in the Exchange Varia- tion of that opening as well, exchanges can help Black in his fight against White's centre, or they can hurt if White is pursuing a queenside minority attack. We might add a couple of king's pawn exam- ples for balance. Take the Maroczy Bind Sicil- ian line 1 e4 c5 2 Qf3 ?k6 3 d4 cxd4 4 Nxd4 g6 5 c4 Af6 6 4k3 (D). There are several lines in which Black's queen goes to a5 and White's to d2 (after _fi_e3 or

and ,.,JLxD because it gives his pieces ma- noeuvring room. By contrast, in the line with 4 f4 jLg7 5 the plan with ...Jlg4 and ...Jkxf3 tends to be undesirable because it helps White to prosecute a kingsidc attack. And so it goes. Although there are patterns, we should remember that every pawn-structure allows for a variety of middlegame plans based on concrete factors. Thus the decision whether to exchange a piece can hang upon a seeming trifle, such as the position of a pawn on h2 or h3, or a king on gl or hl. Can there possibly be talk of a workable 'principle' here? Do good players, while at the board, actually think 'Well, 1 have more space, so I'll try to avoid exchanges'? Of course not; as discussed, one might even say T have more space, so I'D seek out exchanges' with equal or perhaps greater legitimacy Either thought pro- cess is unfounded in reality and in any case im- practical. In the end, any good player uses his or her knowledge of positions, combined with individual assessments of particular continua- tions, to determine whether a given exchange or general simplification is desirable. Bg5), and then after Na4 or S3d5 the exchange of queens on d2 favours White, who has more space. By contrast Black very often makes the early exchange by 6."Nxd4 7 4?xd4 d6 which makes it easier for him to get certain pieces out; for example, his queen's bishop to e6, or the same piece to c6 via d7.

By the term 'development' various authors mean dififerent things* Here I will be concerned with it in the simple sense of bringing one's pieces out, leaving questions of the quality of their dis- position to be discussed case by case* SOMCS emphasized the increasing number of openings in which modem players choose net to bring their pieces out in order to achieve other goals such as establishment of a favourable pawn- structure* Increasingly, we see developmental patterns that defy traditional conceptions. For example, the same piece is moved repeatedly and ends up on a worse square (or even back at home) so as to provoke the opponent into a po- tentially vulnerable situation* Or pieces are de- veloped to apparently awkward squares leading to inharmonious positions for purely pragmatic or prophylactic reasons. We also see pawn- grabbing sorties by the queen to the complete neglect of development, a strategy previously frowned upon by the textbooks. Here I will be looking at these kinds of strategies, but also at the evolution of attitudes towards development in well-established posi- tions, The latter is consistent with the idea of examining change that has became routine as well as that which is exceptional. We will dis- cover an increasingly open-minded approach towards the problem of how to get the pieces out. First, however, I want to make a brief histori- cal digression, Some of the rules and dogmatic assessments that I discussed in SOMCS ap- peared in popular articles such as Steinitz wrote or in relatively elementary books such as Las- ker's 'Manual* or in other general works such as those of Tatrasch. Others showed up in high-level annotations. This raises the question of whether the writers themselves weren't nec- essarily adherents of the views expressed, but were instead writing for the student. In fact, I think that it's fairly easy to distinguish as one reads these texts whether the author is ex- pressing a fundamental belief or giving some oversimplified advice. We will always have in- stances of both. To this day, for example, fixed rules and principles are found in the annota- tions of advanced players, and yet increasingly we also find remarks about ignoring those rules. The play is the thing, and one can only use one's experience and judgement to discern the changes (or lack of them) over the years. For all that, I think that the average player might be surprisedhow ingrained certain prej- udices were in classical times. One cannot mistake the consistent aversion of top players to openings that failed to develop the pieces quickly or to challenge the centre. Along those lines, rules about how to conduct play Took a long time to fade from players' consciousnesses. Rcti, for example, is obviously serious when he talks about the prevalence in even the best of earlier games of "moves that seem self-evident and which the master of routine made without reflection, because such moves were founded on rules of such long standing as to have be- come part of that master's flesh and blood". In the same vein, he finds that in the games of the hypermodem players, "moves that were earlier held to be self-evident, that every good player made automatically, so to speak, must frequently be cast aside." As one of many illus- trations, he emphasizes how the established de- velopmental rules were changing. He cites, for example, the multi-faceted rule that apart from a few moves by central pawns, each move of the opening should develop a new piece, and it should be moved only once if possible (exclud- ing captures, recaptures, and attacked pieces, of course). R6ti finds counter-examples from young players of his time, and with hindsight we can see how the hypermodems themselves, by comparison with players today or even So- viet players in the 1940s, were extremely mod- est in their deviations from the old rules of development. Today, Viktor Korchnoi can mis- chievously say "All obvious moves look dubi- ous in analysis after a game".

and Black's position had fallen apart, In my da- tabase White has scored 5W6 after 3 c5, with a performance rating of over 2700! 3".f6 4e3e5 So far, Black has played a normal solution to 3 b4, one which has discouraged players on the white side of this line for years. But now: 5c51? This extravagant move has suddenly received some serious attention. It seems ridiculous to use a whole tempo to give up the key d5 -square and expose oneself to a crippling ...a5. On the positive side, White stops ...c5 at all costs and temporarily prevents Black from castling after Jtc4 or 18 3. At first thought, neither of these are terribly impressive goals, but there arc con- crete features as well:
5.~d3!?
This intends to cut off White 's fl -bishop and hamper his development for a long time to come. However, it's awfully ambitious, and Korchnoi himself (playing Black) was somewhat sceptical after the game. Quite fascinating play can fol- low the obvious 5",a5 after 6 JiLb5+! c6 7 jSlc4, and here Nikolaevsky -Savchenko, Kiev Plat- onov mem 1995 continued 7".Bg4! with un- clear play. What good did White's check on move 6 do him? It turns out that, had Black played the natural 7...axb4, White could have played 8 53xe5!, intending 8...fxe5? (correct is

6 M2 had been played before, so as to meet
6...a5 with 7 a3. The text-move is much more
interesting, allowing the queenside to be shat- tered for the sake of concrete tactics. Pleasure before Work! The majority of master games played today fob low standard and at least moderately well ana- lysed openings. But it is instructive (and a lot of fun!) to look at some of the many experimental developmental ideas that have been played and investigated recently. The last 10-15 years have seen an explosion in the use of exotic irregular openings, for example. 1 personally find it a great delight when I see something new being played within just the first few moves of the game. One naturally thinks: how could this not have occurred to anyone before? Or if the move occurred once randomly in the past, why didn't it attract any interest then? Today's players are inclined to question everything and have few inhibitions about playing superficially unprin- cipled moves. This can lead to highly entertain- ing play, as illustrated by the following game fragments and the notes within them. Gabriel - Korchnoi Zurich u 1999

A fairly normal move, but it introduces a surprising idea. A related example is Stefan Biickcr's 3 c5!? (N), which has a similarly ir- reverent feel: This looks more or less insane, using up a tempo to expose the c-pawn to attack and give up control of d5 L But there are some good points as well; for one thing.

White develops his bishops before his knights, which tends to be an invitation to oddity. Now the e5-pawn is threatened. 4~ jLdfi!? (D) Doesn't that block the d-pawn? There's a game Suhle-Anderssen, Breslau 1859 with this move, and then nothing that I can find for almost 120 years! Instead, Black has played 4...d6 here as a matter of course.

though B ticker then suggests 13 g4! to break up the pawn-chain.

Black has now made eight straight pawn moves! Korchnoi demonstrates that there is more than one creative player in this game. 9 e6! This move was condemned at the time on ac- count of the course of the game, but turns out to be correct. None of the annotators liked 9,.,JiLxe6> but this is probably best.

White may not seem to have gained much after 10...417 (10...c6? 11 Qd5; 10,..Bd7? 1 1 ftxc7+ 4d8 12 b5 is winning for White), but the queen belongs on a4 and the ex- tra tempo makes a huge difference.

Pytel - Piasetski Bu enos A i res ()L 7 978 Ic4b62d4e63e4 The English Defence was once a scruffy out- sider but is now a member of the respectable classes. More than almost any other modem opening, it has provided eccentric ideas very early on in the game; for example, such things as 3 a3 f5 4 Qc3 W6 5 d5 J.a6! and 3 e4 Jb7 4 ?3c3 J-b4 5 Rc2 Itfh4!. When one side devel- ops both bishops and the queen before any other pieces, the game will generally take an unusual course! 3"jLb7 4f3 This has been fairly successful for White of late. 4 Jd3 J.b4+ 5 J.d2 Jxd2+ 6 lBxd2 43h6!? intending ...f5 is another typical flank development. 4".e5!? (D) At first sight, an utterly bizarre idea. Black moves his e-pawn for the second time in 4 moves, and even offers it up in the bargain! In all the games in my database with the relatively popular 4 f3, Pytel-Piasetski was the only early one in which Black answered 4~.e5. The Cana- dians of the 1970s were investigating all kinds of modem opening set-ups (for example, they had an enormous influence in making 1 e4 g6 respectable), so it doesn't surprise me that In the daily e-zine Chess Today, GM Scher- bakov tells a story. Sveshnikov was showing the move 4".J.d6 to some students at a lecture and was asked "What about 5 fta3?" Svesh- nikov said that, "If you play such an ugly move then we have the right to play the same way'1, and showed them:
5..,Na5!
Very silly. Another knight saunters to the edge of the board. The game to this point has now been seen in several grandmaster contests. Nevertheless, I'm not sure that the average player, seeing their moves, would believe that the players involved were anything but rank amateurs (perhaps teetering on barstools!). In my database, the first person to play 5...5Ba5 was GM Rainer Knaak in 1978, and it was taken up later by GMs Sveshnikov, Speelman, Hector, and HraCek. For the record, less fun but al so satisfactory is 5".a6, which has tended to equalize; and Black can also try 5...e4!? with the idea 6 Qc4 J.e7, as Shabalov once did.

The end of Scherbakov's story is that Sakaev, who attended Sveshnikov*s lecture, soon faced Sveshnikov himself over the hoard (Sakaev- Sveshnikov, Gausdal 1992). He took up the op- portunity to play against 5...5Ba5 and fared mis- erably after 7 ?Sc4 ?Yic4 8 bxc41? 4fe7 9 a4?I O-O 10 Nh3 (White puts yet another knight on the edge of the board to support f4, but after doubling his own pawns and wasting an extra tempo on a4, this is all too slow) 10..Bc5 11

2)d4!? (D} Why not? 5..*Qd4!? is a Belgrade Gambit Reversed, quite logical with g3 included, since that move is of debatable value in this new context. This simple move has been completely unknown to theory and as far as I can tell never even tried until now! The normal move had (naturally) been 5...4Bxd5. My guess is that players shied away from even considering the move 5...Gid4 on the assumption that one should not offer gambits when undeveloped. 6€Bxe5 The most critical move, but risky. Alterna- tives: Piasetski played this way* But just recently
4...e5 has resurfaced, very likely because Dan-
iel King made a case for it in his book on the English Defence* Again, once you see 4**.c5 it makes perfect sense; but you have io be undog- matic enough to consider it in the first place. Black wants the a7-gl diagonal, and if it means both losing a tempo and miserably shutting in his b7-bishop, so be it. 5d5 What about 5 dxe5? Then Black probably plays 5...ftc6, and according to King gets good play following 6 Jkf4 Ab4+ (tir 6...g51? 7 Jkg3 Jkg7) 7 Rc7; instead, 6 f4 can be an- swered by a number of moves such as 6...f6,
6...d6, and 6... b4+7 Bd2 Rh4+ 8 g3 c7, all
of these needing tests. To continue with a little sub-theme, notice that 6 f4 would be the sixth consecutive pawn move for White. 5*..Bc5 A fearsome bishop that compensates for Black's other problems* The fact that White's pawn is on f3 helps Black, because it makes the bishop hard to oppose and extends its scope. At this point it might be worth comparing two sim- ilar early ".e6-e5 attempts after 1 c4 b6 2 d4 e6

like 4...J&.e7, but in any case nothing that inter- fered with Black's dark-square strategy centred about the support of e5, To find and appreciate the move 4".d5 one needed, more than any- thing else, to be able to slop short and recon- sider a preconceived idea of the position. This may have appeared singly at some point or other in chess history (I don't know), but if it did, strong players didn't recognize it for the solution it is. Sometime in the early 1980s the move surfaced with Chernin contributing key ideas. It is now' a main line and has been played by numerous top-ranked GMs such as Kramnik, M Gurevich, Beliavsky, Azmaiparashvili, etc. 5 dxeS 4Bxe4 6 4jd2 Black's pawn sacrifice involves 6 _xe4 dxe4

Zviagintsev did so twice versus Adams in 2001, for example; those are battles betwreen players with an aver- age rating nearing 2700! The first justification is that the natural central counter by 4...J5 only creates problems for Black after 5 g5 (White has won all three games in my database).

Unquestionably, players going back to the 19th century sometimes employed radical strat- egies involving a break with the conventional wisdom. Witness, for example, the recent re- vival of 1 e4 c5 2 c3 IBfaS!?, an early queen sor- tie that was apparently invented by Tarrasch and also used once by Marshall, This move, designed to prevent d4, has been employed re- cently by players such as Movsesian, Kuprei- chik, and Romani shin. But such examples arc hard to come by when investigating classical play, and those that did occur tended to be iso- lated affairs. What we see today is a very large and increasing set of rule-defying ideas that are often discovered simultaneously and quickly adopted eveiywhere. We are so used to this phenomenon that one seldom hears objections on general principle any more. Many variations of the Trampowsky Attack demonstrate the uninhibited nature of develop- ment in contemporary chess. It's easy to forget that this well-established opening was extremely rare only 30 years ago. To give just one exam- ple between grandmasters, here is an example of what became a main line: Hodgson - Wells Copenhagen 1996 ld4Qf6 2&g5 3Bf4c5 4f3Ba5+5c3 6 dS Rb6 7 £cl White nonchalantly returns his bishop co base.

British League (4NCL) 2001/2. 10e3Nc5 11 Does this game look eccentric to you? If not, it's probably because you've absorbed con- temporary pragmatism into your world view. Taking stock: White has no pieces out after 1 1 moves, and has just moved his king! Oddly enough, this whole sequence (including the paradoxical iLg5-f4-cl) may well be best play for White, probably favours him slightly, and has scored quite respectably. Even the most innocent of traditional posi- tions can contain good moves that defy com- mon sense. A very common English Opening position arises after:

It took an experimental and open-minded attitude to take seriously the idea of giving up a precious centre pawn by: 6d4!?(D) Actually, 6 d4 is now so established and common that *!?' isn't really appropriate, but it reflects the initially speculative nature of the move. Chemin was the first to play this in a high-level encounter in 1981 and even then it took time to catch on. For one of my lengthy philosophical digressions about this move and

7 STa4+ and 6,"Qc6 7 Bb5 Jlxc5?? 8 Jlxc6+

Should Black avoid 5..x5, it can be that without a bishop on e2, White's lost tempo can actually help him in lines where ...Jlxfl can be answered by Rxf3 (as opposed to Jlxf3, when the bishop is poorly placed), perhaps followed by Rg3 with kingside pressure. A tempo lost can sometimes be a world gained. Here's another case in which one can't help but think of play by a rank amateur, although we are dealing with very strong masters: detailed analysis of the diverse continuations it engenders, refer to the Part 2 game Voiska- Alexandrova, Warsaw worn Ech 200 L Here I'll just mention a couple of bare-bones ideas here to indicate what logic lies behind it. a) 6". xd4 7 ?kd4 cxd4 (7...Bxd4 8 Qb5 i_e5 9 O-O ties Black up) 8 <be4! d5 (8..>c7?! 9 c5! 5k7 10 i.f4) 9 cxd5 exd5 10 ttTa4+! with fine play. b) 6...cxd4 7 <2>b5 d5 (7...e5?! 8 ?M6+*e7

This is just beyond the pale, isn't it? Should we even take it seriously? Black has only one piece out versus his opponent's three and he gives up a pawn on move 5 for the sake of one open file. Worse, White hasn't the ghost of a weakness. And note that these are two 2500+ players ! 6 ftxh4 e5 7 Qf3 Very logical. Does Black even have a threat? Probably not. One therefore has to call 5...H4 a positional pawn sacrifice! The difficulty for White is just getting his pieces out without per- mitting Black too comfortable a build-up behind his healthy centre. For example, Black would have plenty of play in a line like 7 Qd2 Jtd6 8 c4 Qf6 9 cxd5 cxd5 10 Qb3 Qc6. Ideas of b,. fd7 and ... lh3 also have to be taken seri- ously.

Suiskis recommends either

Revitalizing the Establishment After that enjoyable walk in the wild, I want to turn to several more conventional situations in which the old ideas of development have changed in wrays that we may not even think about. We take many such changes for granted because they have come about by gradual evo- lution and experimentation. Other new ideas burst suddenly upon the scene, but were so quickly absorbed that we are no longer aware of how blasphemous (or at least amusingly irrele- vant) they would have appeared to earlier mas- ters. I'll begin with some familiar cases in which structure takes priority. When one player de- cides not to establish a classical central pawn presence (as in many modern openings), he or she obviously gets more leeway in terms of delayed development, This is simply because there are fewer immediate targets in his or her position, making it (at least initially) less criti- cal to develop. In the Open Sicilian Defence, for example. Black may play a number of pawn moves like ...d6, ...e6, ...a6, and ...b6 or ,..b5 with only a single minor piece out or perhaps just the queen, the piece traditionally admon- ished to stay at home in the opening. For exam- ple, in the Najdorf Sicilian (1 e4 c5 2 5Bf3 d6 3 d4 cxd4 4 ?Bxd4 Qf6 5 4k3 a6), there are lines such as 6 jLc4 e6 7 A,b3 b5 or 6 Jle3 e5 7 Qf3 Bc7 8 a4 h6 or, famously, 6 Ag5 e6 7 f4 Bb6 8 4fd2 Qxb2, etc. The Kan/Paulsen Variation 1 e4 c5 2 f3 e6 3 d4 cxd4 4 Qxd4 a6 (often fol- lowed by 5...Nc7) is an even more extreme case in point Black often plays moves like ...b5, ...d6, and sometimes even ...g6 in this variation before developing his minor pieces. In recent times there have even been variants in which Black's fust piece move is ...1firb6; for example,
2.. x6 3 d4 cxd4 4 Qxd4 lffb6, and if 5
5...1B'c7 6 Nc3 a6 7 -fi_d3 b5. And an exercise in
structural change at loss of tempo is 1 e4 c5 2 Qf3 e6 3 d4 cxd4 4 Qxd4 a6 5 _d3 5}f6 6 O-O e5!? 7 Qb3 d6, from McShane-Romanishin, Lippstadt 1999 and other games. To emphasize how flexible the contempo- rary view of the Sicilian Defence has become, here's a sequence played mainly in the last few

Six straight pawn moves! After 7 (TO. White has four pieces out Co Black's none. I find 28 master-level games with this sequence since 1995 including quite a few with GMs, and Black scores -+4 against only mildly inferior opposition! This particular move-order may or may not become a main line, but all the ex- amples above contrast rather sharply with the older lines 1 e4 c5 2 Qf3 Qc6 3 d4 cxd4 4 ftxd4 &ifh and 1 c4 c5 2 ?lf3 e6 3 d4 cxd4 4 Qxd4 f6 5 *5')c3 4}c6 (or 5."jS_b4), Those variations, with Black's pieces developed apace, are typical of the Sicilian Defences that gained early acceptance.

This is considered unclear by Poluliakhov, but I'd rather be White after 17 4&c4 because it seems to win either the e-pawn or a-pawn, and even without that leaves White with better de- velopment and nicely placed pieces; for exam- ple, 17">f6 (17. JBh4 18 a3 4Vfa6 19 ?lxe5;
17.. T5? 18 a3 ?Ma6 19 Qb6 Sa7 20 ith3 and

12., a4.
Of course there are historical precedents for such thinking (albeit in less extreme form). The Kan/P&ulsen Variation was also played by An- dersson and Paulsen himself in the 19th cen- tury; for example, Paulsen liked to play and sometimes even ...b5 before But such ideas were considered eccentric at best and weren't taken up by the leading players of the day or indeed by the next few generations after him. By contrast, the kinds of sequences described above no longer surprise us today. They appear in many contexts and are concep- tually familiar even to average players. The game that decided the 2002 British Championship illustrates Black's nonchalance with respect to development in the Sicilian: McShane - Ramesh British Ch (Torquay) 2002 le4c5 2Qf3?Bc63Ab5e64 xc6bxc65d3 7 6Qc2f6 7&h4g6 8f4Ng7 9 0-00-010 c4 An example of a very similar black structural strategy is 10 Qf3 e5 11 fxe5 fxe5 12 .XLe3 d6 13 ftbd2 h6 14 a3 Sb8 15 b3 Ae6 16 Qc4 g5! and Black had a fine game in Shariyazdanov- Perunovifi, Subotica 2000. 10",d6 11 Qc3 h6 (D) Now Black has six pawns along his third rank, yet his idea is more than merely prophy- lactic, since he can finally claim space with a coming ...g5 and/or ...e5. 12 1x3 g5 13 2Bf3 gxf4

THE DEVELOPMENT OF DEVELOPMENT 69
White controls the board. Black has no free- ing move or counterplay, Nedev-Oncy, Iraklion 1997. One should also take note of fresh attitudes towards development in common but more tac- tical positions. There are hundreds of estab- lished lines in which creative new moves defy the traditional admonitions about getting the pieces out, so I've just picked a couple that caught my fancy

dxc4 6 e4b5 7a4 Wi 8 Nxf6 grf6 9 Ne2 a6
10 O-O(0)
Once more it seems that an inexperienced player must be conducting the white pieces? He doesn't seem at all concerned about getting his kingside pieces out, which is particularly odd in a variation known for Black's dynamic play. As it turns out, White's strategy is purely pro phy lactic, i.e., Black is unable to play ...Jig4 and his standard central equalizer 9...d5 loses a pawn here to 10 c5 (since b3 has prevented the usual , J c4. Finally, White is prepared to meet Black's most natural move: In fact, 9,..c5 is likely the best if slightly de- pressing chance. An endgame arises after 10 dxe5 dxe5 1 1 WxdS ( 11 c5 has also been played, but is a Jess popular move) ll,, r&xd8 12 c5. This has done well for White, but may be OK for Black if studied in advance and played pre- cisely. 10 d5 Now that White has protected his c3-knight (8 Sei) and his c4-pawn (9 b3), he is able to make this move and disrupt Black's game. Thus White's opening set-up has also served as a pro- phylactic manoeuvre against 9...?k6.
10...?te5 11 Ne2
Continuing a preventative policy: Black is denied or .-fi.g4 and White still doesn't commit his king's knight.

There are of course alternatives known to theory, but this move best illustrates the play 12$>f3 f613h3 Here 13 Qd4 has been played and is proba- bly better, but 1 3 h3 continues with the theme of denying any squares to Black's pieces.

This is a well-known position in which at the very least Black has serious practical difficul- ties, He is a pawn up, but has only the queen out, is way behind in development, and is sub- ject to attacks based upon d5 and b3. What's more, he has doubled pawns on the side of the board where his king will usually go. Surely it's time to get some pieces out?

Rh4 11 h3 Qtxf2!), 10".?k5 11 Nc2 I'm skipping the numerous alternatives at each juncture, of course. The positional charm of this variation can be seen in lines such as 11 jfiLbl 12f4#k4 13 Rd3b5! 14b3 Qb415 This is it: move the king's knight five times to put it on the edge of the board next to another knight also on the rim! In addition, the knight has no moves there. But the peripatetic piece proves to be quite useful in support of queen- side play, since ...b5 is coming and White's a4 creates a weakness on b3 and can be met by ...c4 and ...Qb4 or ...4k5, Nor can White be said to have merely overextended, because there are plenty of examples to show that his more conservative approaches are OK for Black as well. 14a3 b5 15 Sbl b4 16 ?U2 bxa3 17 Axa3 Sb8 18 *h2 Nd7 The game is equal, Serper-Nenashev, Novo- sibirsk 1989.

strategies. See the chapter on flank advances for a detailed look at some of these. Also, Part 2 includes games such as Kasparov-Shirov, Hor- gen 1994, a famous example of how a strategic plan can be pursued at the cost of considerably delayed development. Finally, in part due to my strong leaning towards top-level players in this book, I would remind the reader that there are incredibly creative and unexpected ways of getting the pieces out in slightly less respected but perfectly playable openings to which I have unfortunately not paid attention. To name a few out of many such: the Leningrad Dutch (a gold- mine of modem ideas), Pirc Defence, the 2 c3 Sicilian, 1 b3, and many variants of the Modem Defence. If you study or play these openings, you will see examples of just about every form of development (or non -development) that de- fies classical precepts. Development and Pawn-Chains Continuing with conventional openings, let's consider the 'semi-closed' variations of the French Defence, that is, ones in which White plays e5. These provide a setting in which, over the years, both moderately and radically differ- ent ideas have become routine over the years and been assimilated into our thinking. Hie d4/c5 structure is particularly relevant since it was the basis for Nimzowitsch's discussion of pawn-chains. From the white point of view, relative ne- glect of development for structure reached new heights in the 1960s in lines such as 1 e4 e6 2 d4 d5 3 Qd2 (the Tarrasch Variation) 3...Qf6 4 e5 2rfd7 5 f4 c5 6 c3 Gk6 7 £df3 Rb6, when Benko and others found the idea of tucking the king away by 8 g31? cxd4 9 cxd4 Nb4+ 10 <S?f2 f6 11 *g21 (D). After 1 1 moves, White has moved his king twice and only has one piece out (versus five for Black after 1L,.O-O), but he stands quite well. He is finally ready to play moves like _&d3 and Ne2 (which generally would have failed tacti- cally if played before this); and even if that re- organization is discouraged by Black, White can always play still further pawn moves such as a3 and b4 and h4? The best way to under- stand how this sequence was previously ne- glected is to examine older tries with the more natural developing moves involving ?Be2-c3 and/or _fi_e3, a3, b4, Jkb2, Ld3( and similar ideas. These failed essentially due to ...O-O and ...fxe5 with pressure down the f-fi!e in conjunc- tion with sacrificial ideas involving ,.. idxe5, ."JXxf3, and/or ...?Axd4. In view of those lines, it was counter-intuitive that one would choose a slow set-up like g3 and Sfaf2-g2 that actually in creased Black's development advantage. But this combination of moves quickly became the main line and single-handedly dragged f4 from relative disuse into a major variation. That discovery (Benko-Schmid, Dublin 1957 is the earliest example I can find) fairly quickly caught on and was only the beginning of the- matically similar ideas, For example, White now plays lines like 8 a3 (in place of 8 g3)
8...Be7 (another example of purposeful non-
devdopment by White is 8...a5 9 b3 Jte7 10 h4 Qa7 11 h5) 9 h4 (this is not only aggressive, but has a prophylactic effect against .*.g5) 9...cxd4 10 cxd4 f5 1 1 h5 (Df

The earliest games that I see with this move are in 1988, and yet it caught on im- mediately and became a main line. Now there are 226 examples in my database. A typical continuation is 8...cxd4 9 cxd4 Bb4+ 10 4?f2 jLe7 1 1 i?g3!?.

Anand - Shirov Teheran FIDE Wch (4) 2000 8<"f6 As White has increasingly turned to prophy- lactic pawn moves, Black himself has often moved away from brute force development (and subsequent sacrifices) to his own very untradi- tional methods. Lali 6-Speelman, Hastings 2000 provides one example, continuing 8 +"-fi_e7 9 g3 a5 10h4a41? 11 Nh3 2klb8!?.Here Speelman shows that White isn't the only one who can move backwards1 His approach to this middle- game is philosophically opposite of what Black has mostly used for over 100 years. A similar reorganization is often seen in the f4 Tarrasch Variation, but with the solid defensive move ...f5 already in. Lali6-Speelman continued 12 h5 cxd4 1 3 cxd4 Nd7 14 O-O Qa5 1 5 4k3 Nc4 with a complex game that Speelman eventually won. I'm not sure whether this is an ideal ap- proach, but at any rate Black took a clear lead in the anti -development competition! 9a3±e710h4! (D) successors considered such sequences perfectly normal. The oldest near-precedent for all this can be seen in this variation:

Qce2 cS 6 f4 ?k6 7 c3 IBrbfi 8 (D) 5 5ke2 has been around for a long time. It was introduced by Steinitz in the 19th century and has been played to some extent in every time period since. At least in this case, as op- posed to the 5 f4 Tarrasch above, White has an- other piece out; and he generally doesn't go running around with his king (at least not vol- untarily'). But even this position wasn't looked upon very favourably for White for many years until recently, when it has undergone a new in- terpretation more in line with the radical non- development philosophy that we are discuss- ing. In the following game we see the intense clash between structural and dynamic priori- ties. Note that White and Black play on both sides of the board. This additional pawn move supports attack- ing ideas involving h5 (or in some cases S)g5), sets up the defensive/aggressive Hh3, and sig- nificantly, it also acts as a prophylactic versus Black's undermining move ."g5. If you look at games in this variation from the 19ih century and most of the last one (many of them only in tournament books, of course), you sec that beginning with move 9, White was almost never content to leave his pieces on their home squares for very long, preferring to de- velop with such moves as g3 and Juh3, or 5 g3,

Another semi-closed French Defence line is the Advance Variation, 1 e4 e6 2 d4 d5 3 e5, which is quite popular with top players right now. The conceptual changes in this opening in recent years have been dramatic and instruc- tive. Traditional strategy used to consist of a fairly mechanical battle over who would con- trol the d4-square, with both sides developing quickly to do so; for example, 3..x5 4 c3 5Bc6 5 Ftf3 "Tb6 6 Be2 cxd4 7 cxd4 fth6 8 b3 Nf5 9 Nb2kb4< lO&fL In the last two decades or so. both White and Black have approached these positions differ- ently, taking initially moderate and then more radical measures.

Thus it has re- placed its comrade by means of the route £k3- e2 gl, and the position is looking very similar to the 5 f4 Tarrasch Variation above. Paradoxi- cally - and what are these kinds of middle- games if they aren't paradoxical? - White may even stand better than he did there, despite having taken two full extra moves to get his knights to exactly the same positions on gl and f3!

74 CHESS STRATEGY IN ACTION
10114 White seems more interested in pawn moves than getting his pieces out. Sveshnikov, who played this move, has been and probably still is the world's greatest expert in the Advance Vari- ation, His philosophy is very much what we have been describing: the establishment of space on the wings without much concern about nor- mal development or king position. This and the next two games are also illustrations of the new love affair with flank moves before the comple- tion of development. We repeatedly see, for ex- ample, b4, g4, and h4-h5. Two heavyweights faced off in this position in Ivanchuk-Bareev, Dubai rpd 2002, again combining flank moves and tactics: 10 g4!? 4jfe7 (10,"Qh6 is also played, when White can throw caution to the winds via 1 1 2g 1 f6 12 exf6 gxf6 13 f7 14 $la4 Rc7 with un- clear play, Savii'Lputian, Ncum 2002) 1 1 ?k3 <2ja5! 12Qd2 (12Qa4 Web is unclear) 12...flc8

As for White, develop- ment is increasingly taking a back seat to pawn moves aimed at prevention of his opponent's ideas. Let's look at a couple of typical games: Tfmman - Nlkolid AwLFterdam 7999

The move h6 loosened up Black's kingside, which might end up exposed after the necessary- freeing move ".f6. And now the fur- ther pawn move c4 will destroy or immobilize Black's centre. Thus Black has to move quickly and exploit his lead in development.

In this and the next game, Black plays as though he couldn't care less about the d4-point. 8g3!? A slightly odd but logical move, covering f4 and preparing a space- grabbing kingside ad- vance.

2 Modern Understanding of
Pawn Play move ...e5j leaving his d-pawn backward on an open file." Obviously both of these arc logical by classical theory, but they have been proven wrong by modem practice. In the Caro-Kann Defence, Fine says that 3 e5 (after 1 e4 c6 2 d4 d5) is "entirely useless", because unlike the French Defence case with 3 e5, Black can put his bishop on f5, outside the pawn-chain, fol- lowing up with ...c5 al some point. Frankly, that was my own instinctive attitude towards 3 e5 in the Caro Kann for many years, so it's not as though the idea isn't rationally grounded in principle. As it turns out, however, 'bad' bish- ops are often as useful as 'good' ones; and more importantly, a very complex set of spe- cific moves and responses has ultimately dem- onstrated that White can get promising play by at least two systems of development after 3 e5 Citing such examples, Bill Kelleher says of Fine: "He seems never to have fully realized the implications of the new ideas introduced by [the Soviet chess revolution]." By contrast, Draien Marovic builds a mod- em model of the evolution of pawn play in his Dynamic Pawn Play in Chess. He divides chess history into very approximate theoretical peri- ods in which masters successively learned how to play: a) Open pawn centres, which were under- stood early on. b) Closed pawn centres, the principles of which began to be grasped after Steinitz through the play of Rubinstein, Capablanca and others, but the broad understanding of which awaited the players of the 1960s and after. c) Piece-controlled centres of the hyper- modems. d) Fixed pawn centres, the 'underlying mechanisms' of which he thinks were under- stood through most of the 20th century. Introduction Every book on the general theory of chess has to place the pawns at the forefront of discus- sion. In the end, pawns are fundamentally more important to strategy than their more powerful cohorts. They are indeed still the soul of our game. The nuances of and changes in pawn- structures determine where, how, and with what effect the pieces can manoeuvre. Accordingly, I devoted more space to pawn play in SOMCS than to any other topic. In this book 1 will con- centrate heavily upon three aspects of pawn play that have been of revolutionary impor- tance to modern chess. In addition, but with much less detail, I will expand upon some other pawn issues raised in SOMCS. Reuben Fine's The Ideas Behind the Chess Openings has always been a very popular book and in some sense a chess student's textbook for openings. Fine was of course one of the world's very top players in the late 1930s, using a classical style with tremendous success. He superficially revised his bookin 1989 but kept most of his old ideas and claimed that opening theory "had reached its full maturity in the pe- riod from 1930 to 1945". It is very risky to use quotes from players as evidence for one's case, but sometimes the phrasing strongly indicates a genuine belief and or at least reflects an attitude of the time in which they played. Fine's 'old school' comments about pawn moves are there- fore of interest. In the Sicilian Defence, he sets forth the rules "for all variations11. Here are two: "(1) Black must never allow White to play c4 because he then has no counterplay on the c-file and is thereby doomed to passivity; (2) After White has played d4, Black must not
MODERN UNDERSTANDING OF PAWN PLAY 79
e) The 'dynamic' pawn centre of modem times, gaining importance in the 1940s and still being expanded upon today. He points out that the dynamic pawn centre has become the most important one both in fre- quency and for exploration. "Everything we knew about the dynamic pawn centre half a century ago has been questioned and re-ex- amined. We owe the fascinating process of our dine to the spirit of experimentation, readiness to enter the unknown and to take risks, but first and foremost to a new attitude borne out of con- viction that all is possible if supported by con- crete calculation. That seems to be the only general maxim the modem interpreter of the dynamic centre is ready to accept without res- ervation, to play and live by." Needless to say, these sentiments are very much in line with my own observations. I also tend to think that there has been some fundamental change in under- standing and playing several of the other centre type's especially the closed and fixed ones, as may be seen in examples throughout this book. Note that MaroviS's emphasis on the centre is the traditional one. But while that sector has always attracted most of the attention and re- spect of theoreticians, a change is underway. Of late, flank play has taken on a life of its own, no longer subservient to or dependent upon central structure but in a mutual relationship on equal grounds or sometimes even one of controlling influence. This development is the most dra- matic and fastest changing in modem pawn play. I believe that as late as the 1990s and into this century, a whole new understanding has arisen about flank pawn advances. This contin- ues the trend I discussed in SOMCS but brings it to such an extreme that it will become a major theme in all parts of this book, including the section that follows. In a sentiment echoed by many, Marovifi says: "The boundaries between opening and middlegame, invisible but felt clearly by an ex- perienced player, show a tendency of disap- pearing to such an extent that many a time only at reaching an endgame does a player become aware that he is out of the opening .,.The subtle relation of marching pawns on different wings, the undefined centre offering both sides numer- ous options, the variety of pawn advances and tactical blows make assessments increasingly difficult. Each position, as if evading general principles, must be assessed on its own more than ever/ 4 1 think that explains a great deal about why opening theory, now extending well into the 10s and 20s of moves in many open- ings. serves as the best way to make comp;, tive observations about middlegame strategy. With the pawn- structures retaining some essen- tial character and yet subject to various changes that resemble each other from game to game, we are able to gain an appreciation of what is truly new in contemporary play. By contrast, the random and chaotic nature of late middle- games arising from these dynamic pawn cen- tres that Marovic talks about inhibits strategic discussion. That is, philosophical changes are hard if not impossible to demonstrate in the sense of adducing multiple examples of them. Getting back to this book, the reader may have noticed to what a great extent 1 have al- ready stressed pawn play. The surrender of the centre, for example, is a subject based upon pawn-structure. More radically, the section 'The Development of Development' contained one after another discussion of pawn play and struc- ture. Jt presented, for example, many examples of the use of multiple pawn moves to establish structure, with an often extreme neglect of de- velopment. We also saw numerous examples of early flank pawn advances (see the large section below). Most importantly, there was a lengthy segment on pawn-chains, a subject that I will forego here for that reason. What I emphasize in this chapter therefore will be a limited number of fascinating new strategies of pawn play. These will often spring from known structures, some of them repealed in characteristic openings. Others will appear more or less out of the blue and demonstrate the uninhibited attitude that pervades contempo- rary practice. 1 will follow this with short com- ments upon other pawn subjects discussed in
SOMCS.
2.1 The Flank Pawns Have Their Say
issue of Informatar, TWIC or CBM would probably provide enough material for a lengthy article. In the interest of communicating the main themes coherently, I shall mostly limit my examination to positions involving the kingside advances g4, h4, ...g5, and ...h5. These will in- clude recognizable structures whose rapidly- evolving treatment exemplifies the overall trend in philosophy. Before plunging into examples, it's worth considering what the main reasons arc for play- ing on the flanks early in the game. There are a variety of ideas here, and any particular exam- ple of a flank advance will probably involve more than one of them, but here is a short list: 1) The most obvious motivation is direct, immediate attack upon the king. This was the most common reason that players in pre -modem chess hurled their flank pawns forward, feeling that a successful attack justifies weaknesses. I am concerned with strategy and don't want to spend too much time discussing what amount to tactical issues. Still, it is noteworthy when we see strong players resort to brute force at- tack in violation of the traditional principles of central play. It may turn out that the defensive reaction to direct attack will involve conces- sions in the positional battle that follows. 2) Another reason for early flank advances is to drive back enemy pieces, in order to re- lease pressure on one*s own position, remove defenders, and/or hamper the coordination of the enemy pieces. 3) Increasingly, flank moves are prophylac- tic in nature, i.e., they prevent undesirable or troublesome pawn or piece moves on the part of the opponent. 4) A major positional reason for pawn- thnists on the wing is to establish space, regard- less of whether there is an attack in sight, and regardless of the internal weaknesses created thereby. With the control of space may come greater ease of development and mobility for Introduction The single biggest change in opening and mid- dlegame strategy in the last two to three decades has been in the area of flank pawn advances. Traditional theory was extremely wary of using the a-, b-, g- and h-pawns to attack or grab space except under specified circumstances. The overall cautionary precept was that pawn moves tend to create weaknesses and thus should be avoided without strict justification. The particular rule that applied was that a stable or, better yet, locked centre was a precondition for flank pawn advances. This was held to be especially true for kingside pawn advances, and thus for any early thrust of the wing pawns when the king's eventual position was as yet unsettled. In game notes one would often see a disadvantage or Loss ascribed to some attack on the wing when the centre was not yet stabilized. Naturally players sometimes indulged in ex- ceptions to these guidelines, especially when in a particular position practice revealed that the dangers were merely apparent. But it wasn't until the middle of the 20th century that the prevailing attitude gradually began to change; and with the current generation of players, the whole framework seems to have been thrown overboard. As ever in modem chess, pragma- tism reigns. Advances on the wing can some- times be permanently weakening, of course; but they are very often positionally desirable and/or necessary, whether or not the central sit- uation is resolved. The most dramatic indica- tion of the change that has taken place can be seen from the flank pawn advances in very early stages of the game. The reader will find considerable overlap here with the section on development in Chapter 1. This is an area in which choosing material is almost impossible because the matter under discussion saturates modem chess. A single

the pieces on that wing. Previously, central space has been regarded as the absolute key to greater freedom and mobility for one's pieces; and of course it remains a vital factor. But as we have seen t the necessity of defending central pawns and preventing their undermining can tic down one's own pieces as well. Space grabs on the wing implicitly express the idea that piece movements under the protection of pawns on one side of the board can sometimes have just as much or more effect as those supported by central pawns. Naturally, such considerations are too broad to analyse outside the context of particular positions, and they are necessarily in some kind of competition with other important factors. Nevertheless, I think that if s obvious that the gain of flank space is far more aggres- sively pursued today than in the past This is a tendency that one can see gradually increasing since the 1950s, but which has become dramat- ically ubiquitous in contemporary play. General Examples from Practice While the most exciting changes have taken place over the past 10-15 years, let's first turn to a couple of precedents for such pawn advances from Botvinnik, one of the most positionally creative players in history. We begin with a classic game that is worth seeing again in the context of later ideas: Botvinnik - Smyslov Moscow Wch (2) 1954

_&a6 6 a3 Be7 7 Nf4 d5 8 cxdS JLxfl 9 &xfl exdS 10 g4! (D) Peter Wells commented upon this famous move, which seems to expose the wing upon which White's king resides: "It's all here: space; driving/restrictjng pieces, even the pawn-storm - even prophylaxis. The implied threat to d5 will discourage Black from ever considering counterplay in the centre (with ,..c5) and hence the 'fixed centre' which encourages White's wing ambitions looks here to stay. It also has, crucially, timing. If Black had a tempo either to castle or to play _..c6, he would be able to orga- nize his knights optimally, As it is, they are likely to impinge on each other's space since they both need to land on d7. Thus are space ad- vantages driven home." The hard thing to realize (or remember) is how original and daring this move appeared at the time it was first played. Today it might well be the first move that a strong master would consider. 10_.c6 11 g5 £tfd7 12 h4 Nd6 Black is cramped and lacks ideas, so he tries to exchange pieces. Now White can keep a comfortable edge by 13 Qg4, but correctly de- cides to switch to attack mode: 13 e4! dxe4 14 £ xe4 Axf4 15 Lxf4 O-O 16 h5fD) Completing the cramping, space-gaining plan started by 10 g4.

Black's idea is a primi- tive one: to play ...h5-h4 and ,"hxg3, either be- fore or after driving the knight back from f3, and then playing for mate on the h-file! Failing that, Biack feels that trading weaknesses for a gain of space on the kingside will be a good deal, and that the time lost by White in retreat- ing his knight will compensate for the time he has spent on the exotic ...g5-g4. 1 think that most experienced players at the time looked askance at the move, which appears both ama- teurish and ovcropbmistic. But then it was taken up by others and is considered playable and al- most normal. Black's opening, incidentally, is a case of a reversed position that makes more sense for the player with a tempo less. I discussed how this occurs in SOMCS and quite a few other writ- ers have been discussing the idea of late. Here the move 8...g51? is especially jolting because Black is after all a full tempo down on a stan- dard white position in the Classical Dragon Si- cilian. Imagine being able to play this way for mate against the Dragon! But of course While's extra move in that opening is 0'0, with the suit that there will be neither mates nor even a rook on an open file should he embark upon g4 and h4-h5. 9d3 This is the natural response, but no longer the most popular move. The two alternatives perfectly illustrate classical and modem ap- proaches to early flank advances: a) 9 d4!? follows the traditional rule that a flank thrust should be met by central action, but grandmasters have only seen fit to try it once. After 9-.xxd4 10 b5 M5 11 Sal, Korchnoi gives ll.,.d3 (11...M41? was played in Clae- sen-M.Gurevich, Antwerp 1994) 12exd3 a6 13 4k3 g4 14 fth4!

The real point is that such an apparently unsupported attack could be so dev- astating. One may have noticed that Black doesn't have to be developed in order to lash out with his flank pawns, nor does the centre have to be stabilized. The following game illustrates a variation of the English Opening that has been fully respectable for 30 years or so: Hulak-Z. Almasl Pula 2001 Ic4e5 2g3 5k6 3Bg2g6 4 5k3jig7 5e3d6 6 £}ge2 h5 This early flank advance becomes particu- larly relevant to our discussion if White re- sponds in classical fashion to the 'premature' flank attack as follows: 7d4 h4 (D) 8 dS White nearly always plays this and it is the consistent move to stake a claim to superiority in the centre. Trying to open the game by 8 dxe5? 4bcc5 merely empowers Black's g7 -bi shop to no good effect and to make things worse, both ...Bg4 and ...h3 are then threatened. 8"4ke7 9 e4f5 10 Bg5 h3 11 Nf3 1 1 Afl has also been tried, keeping an eye on the h-pawn at the cost of development.

The main line is safer, when theory suggests 12 #d2 although simply 12".fxe4! 13 _fijtf6 Bxf6 14 Qxe4 Bg7 gives Black two bishops and options for his pieces like 15 ?Y2c3 f5! intending ...Nd4, or 15 0-04) Nf5 followed by ...Abb.

A rook's pawn advance (even one involving opening one's own rook's file) is often followed by castling on the same wing. Thus wc see that what is apparently an attacking idea can also be used for positional purposes. In this position Black has cramped his opponent's kingside and forced the light-squared bishop to an awkward square. This goes well with the opening of the bishop's file that potentially follows ,..f5.

Flank Attacks, Space, and Weaknesses Today there are a variety of early g-pawn and h pawn advances w'hose purpose is primarily attacking, particularly those directed against a fianchetto position. But theoretically, the big change has come with the introduction of many new flank attack strategies that try to cramp the opponent and win by virtue of greater ma- noeuvring room and mobility, regardless of the weaknesses created thereby. The purely tactical impression that these variations give can some- times arise when the defender strikes back in the centre, and this natural response can ob- scure the positional subtext of the line. Take, for example, this dynamic variation in the con- servative Caro-Kann, one that we take com- pletely for granted now: Shabalov - Times Foxwoods 2001 1 e4cti 2 d4 d5 3 eS J.f5 4 Cc3 e6 5 g4 Again this thrust.

THE FLANK PAWNS HAVE THEIR SAY 87
This opening highlights the pragmatism that pervades modem chess, Of course there is some logic to 4 4)c3, 5 g4 and 6 4 ge2, otherwise it wouldn't be effective. But the justification for these moves depends heavily upon concrete move-orders and tactics, specifics that are not apparent by considering the position in a de- tached way, however grounded in principle one may be. So to begin investigating this variation as a potentially serious weapon and have faith that they weren't wasting their time, the devel- opers of 5 g4 had to be free of and/or willing to ignore some traditional prejudices. Quite apart from the taboos against early flank pawn moves, 4$)c3 itself isn't consistent with a conventional view of the d4/e5 pawn-chain, which would re- quire c3 to bolster the centre against ".c5. That might seem to be a particularly devastating ar- gument against ?k3 in combination with g4, since it is usually true that when such a centre is broken up (e.g, by ..,cxd4 and perhaps even ". lxe5), the interior weaknesses created by advanced flank pawns are exposed. And there are various other arguments that one could ad- duce based upon the lack of targets in Black's position and the poor prospects for a piece like the c3-knight (where is it going?). But by play- ing moves with specific attacking and space- grabbing ideas, White can find both positional and tactical justification for his set-up. "-Qe7 The most popular move at the top today. As an outsider to this variation, the main lines after
6...c5 7 Be3 or 7 h41? (for two more games
with these moves, see Shirov-Nisipeanu in Part 2 and the game Grishchuk-Shirov, which is im- bedded in it) still strike me as unclear, but both White's results and his theoretical standing seem to be getting better and better as time goes along. The variations with 6...c5 put into relief one of the compelling issues in modem chess: right at the beginning of the opening, the centre is compromised for the sake of the flank. Natu- rally, the degree of that compromise and the compensation on the flank will vary from case to case, but if s no wonder that these lines didn't catch on in more conservative times. Some- times both sides play in both spheres and every- thing starts to look like trial and error; e.g., some recent analysis by Nisipeanu goes 6,.,c5 7 Ae3 cxd4 8 £kd4 Qd7 (8...h5 9 Nb5+ Qd7 10 This has been all the rage for over a decade now. These moves went untried by a lengthy list of the world's elite for a century or more (al- though it should be said that Korchnoi actually played this once in 1951), For some reason, se- rious investigation of this line by top players didn't begin until around 1980, and didn't truly explode until around 1990, Now my database has over 8(X) games beginning with 5 g4, many featuring the world's top grandmasters such as Topalov, Shirov, Anand, and Khalifman. What's going on and why did it take so long to appreciate White's possibilities? I'm sup- posed to be explaining some things about mod- em chess, but the fact is that I continue to find it amazing that White can achieve anything in this way. He throws his g-pawn forward and wants to play h4-h5; this is a plan? Surely Black, free of weaknesses and logically developing his bishop outside the pawn-chain, has done noth- ing to deserve so much trouble from a raft of nondeveloping pawn moves. In many openings, Black would gladly give his opponent such weakening flank moves for free! In fact, I admit that when 5 g4 stormed onto the scene, I was sure that a positional refutation would be found, or at least a solution that rendered it boringly harmless. Then we would get back to playing rational lines like 3 Qc3 dxe4 4 ?)xe4 or 3 exd5 cxd5 4 c4. But that hasn't happened - quite the opposite. In 2001, Kasparov himself used 5 g4 to beat Anatoly Karpov with apparent ease. This had doubly symbolic value regarding the respectability of the variation, since Karpov is arguably the greatest Caro-Kann player in his- tory. It's perhaps not surprising that were see- ing a lot of the move 4,.,h5 these days!

It would be an understatement to call these lines dynamic, and the fun part is that all these variations are still expanding instead of being fully worked out. In fact, just in the last months since 1 wrote these lines, some of the most amazing games of re- cent years have appeared in precisely this varia- tion.

I think that I said something about White's plan being h4-h5? But the recently popular 7 f4, which hardly springs to mind in a first look at the position, demonstrates that White's posi- tion has a certain flexibility. The move 7 4)f4 intending h4 has been the only move until re- cently, when again White sacrifices the centre for dynamic possibilities: 7...c5 8 dxc5!?

Ljubojevid- Hausrath Enschede 2002 24 g4! Simple once you see it, but easy to miss. Given his way, Black intends to implement a plan that has served strong players well in this position: he intends to play ...Bh7 and ...Ah6, after which White's best bishop disappears and the queenside becomes much easier to defend, whereas ...f5 can follow on the kingsidc. The move 24 g4 will meet that idea by g5, and White's apparent kingside weaknesses after g4 prove to be no problem. 24 hxfi 4 25 hxg4 Re7 26 g5 f5 27 gxf6 #\dxf6 28 Ng3 Rd7 29 ±e2 Now White's bishops are actively aimed at the quccnside, which guarantees a win in al- most every endgame.

Rxf3 g6 lliis variation has become very popular for Black In spite of moving his queen's knight three times, he tries to show that White's queen is not very well placed on f3. For one thing, White's most attractive move, d4, isn't sup- ported by any piece. Indeed, in the early games with this line White would sometimes play the move Wdl, just to enforce d4. Here he just chooses to develop instead:

It is a prophylactic versus but also just a space gainer which maintains flexibility. In some cases g5 can cramp Black, in others h4-h5 is contemplated. A new idea just a decade ago,
8 g4 has become the most important move in
this line. 8"Zb8 Normally played, to free the queen's bishop, is a direct challenge to White's phi- losophy: 9 g5 (9 h3 1?

Another variation of the English Opening had a reputation for dry' manoeuvring until it re- cently occurred to somebody (or somebodies) that space-gaining flank advances in this line don't have to be heavily supported or even initi- ated on the side of the board where the ad- vancer's pieces are directed.

A sophisticated move-order designed to pre- vent White's standard Grand Prix Attack with Bc4 and f5. Black is perfectly happy to piay the Najdorf/Scheverungen position that arises after
5 d4 cxd4 6 *Sxd4 ?}f6. Now 5 g3 with a Closed
Sicilian is nearly always played, if only for lack of alternatives. 5 fi4! (D) I certainly felt that way, and I was always happy when someone (usually a much lower- rated player) would toss out such a loosening move. It is only recently that so wide a variety of positions both quiet and tactical are being in- vigorated by fearless creativity on the flanks, and at risk of repealing myself, 1 feel this to be the single most important development in chess over the last few decades.
5..,d5
Central responses are not always ideal ver- sus flank advances, as we have seen; but here I like this move, even if it is the fifth consecutive one with pawns and the second with the queen's pawn! Basically the reason rests with White's specific range of answers to the serious posi- tional threat of 6,.dxe4. 6d3I? As in so many of the lines that we're looking at, there are plenty of interesting alternatives; for example: a) 6 exd5 exd5 7 g5l? would be strange- looking but has its good points. Then Re2+ is an idea, or just 4lg2 and O-O. White's lead in de- velopment might well give him a small advan- tage. b) 6 e5 is also quite playable, especially since 6...h51? 7 g5 is a promising trade-off of space and development for the weakness on f5. Kempinski argues that 6,.,dxc4 7 dxe4 Wxdl+ 8 ftxdl Nf6 9 4hf2 favours White slightly. This is hard to assess, but White's pieces will come out very smoothly.

This advance is soundly based and not at all speculative; in fact, after most natural continuations White will stand somewhat better. For one thing he can usually return to the Closed Sicilian by 4lg2t when the move g4 can usefully gain a tempo on White's normal Closed Sicilian strategy of g3 followed by g4, Furthermore, moves like h4 and g5 are just as cramping and irritating as in the Open Sicilians to which, it should be added, White can still return by d4 in many lines. If moves like 5 g4 are legitimate, one has to wonder where players have been all these years. 1 would argue that such moves 'looked1 over- committal and premature to the player growing up with traditional strategic theory.

Suddenly what looks like a normal distri- bution of forces is extremely difficult for Black in view of White's idea of a simple pawn ad- vance on the kingside and consequent attack. In view of this, Black tries to strengthen his dark squares on the kingside, but the c5-bishop is cut off from the action. Also, Black needs to clear a square for his f6-knight.

On his video biography, Kasparov shows this game and makes some comments about how many grandmasters expressed scepticism over White's strategy involving g4. He thinks that professional players of that time (1980) were in general too cautious and ""scared to push pawns [in front of their king]". Maybe this isn't the perfect example, but I think he's basi- cally right, especially in cases where White hasn't even completed his development. It's easy to forget how unusual such games looked because White's play all looks so natural now. Knight's Pawn Advances As should be obvious from the above, a great deal of attention is being given to knight's pawn

moves. Although new modes of play with b4 and ...b5 are constantly being found, the moves g4 and ...g5 are more striking because they oc- cur on the side of the board where the kings will usually reside or want to reside. Before moving on to a more focused discussion (g4 and ...h5 in Sicilian Defences), let's take a look at some sta- tistics involving g4 in different eras. Here all the usual qualifications about statistics apply, perhaps even more so. For example, there are base positions in which a knight's pawn move is routine but unremarkable. An extreme case is the extraordinarily high use of ...g5 in the years previous to 1 900; it turns out that the great ma- jority are due to ...g5 in the King's Gambit, which merely defends a pawn. Since there are few such instances applying to g4, 1 have cho- sen to count all the games in which that move is played up to move 10. In my databases with only leading players from each era, I find that g4 is played (up to move 10) as follows: a) Up to 1900: in 1.55% of all games, and not too effectively, since White scores only 43%. b) 190D1935: 1.2%, with White scoring 63%. c) 1936-1970: 1.3%, with White scoring 57%. d) 1985-2002 (the period Kasparov gave as involving a change in chess practice): 3.1% with White scoring 61%. Since 55% is the average overall winning percentage for White, the choice of g4 has ap- parently been well motivated (the sample size is 772 games with g4 in the latter case, for example). Comparing recent play in a much broader spectrum of strengths, we find that in the TWIC database for 2001 to the present, White plays g4 up to move 10 in 3.6% of all games, scoring 57%. A full 38% of these TWIC games with g4 up to move 10 involved Open Sicilians. We al- ready discussed in SOMCS the explosion of White's early g4 moves in most variations of the Sicilian Defence. In particular White's early flank attack with f3 and g4 has suddenly be- come routine in many new Sicilian settings. Not long ago, it appeared almost exclusively in the Dragon Variation, and was considered harmless versus such defences as the Najdorf, Scheven- ingen, and Richter-Rauzer. Now it appears in numerous subvariations and even the main lines of those variations. I think that this change came about primarily because White discov- ered that, contrary to the stereotype, playing two extra pawn moves on the kingsidc (f3 and g4, sometimes even with h4) did not in fact al- low the classic Black response in the centre by ...d5 (or ...e5 and then ...d5). Once a pawn gets to g4, the possibility of permanently cramping Black's game by g5 arises, so the move has po- sitional as well as attacking points. In general, this is often referred to as the 'English Attack', and it has spread to both Najdorf and Schev- eningen lines, as well as to one of the very main lines of the Rauzer Defence. For example, Black has been hard-pressed recently to find anything that doesn't give White a clear advantage (much less the usual small edge) in the variation 1 e4 c5 2 d6 3 d4 cxd4 4 Qxd4 Qsf6 5 4k3 e6 6 jLe3 ftc6 7 f3 -fi.e7 8 Qd2 O-O (or 8...a6 9 O-O-O O-O 10 g4) 9 g4. How times have changed! In 7 consecutive games of Informator 83, for exam- ple, there are 9 Sicilians with an early g4, 7 of them in different and mostly new variations. Here's an extremely accelerated version of the g4 idea that was even effective against Kaspa- rov: Ivanchuk - Kasparov Moscow Russia vs RoW rpd 2002 1 e4c5 d6 3 d4 cxd4 4#lxd4 Nf6 5 c3 a6 6Hgl!?

Radical Preventative Measures In most variations, White isn't completely giv- ing up upon king safety by playing g4, because he normally has the move O-O-O in reserve, even if his king can be rather vulnerable on the queenside. Black, on the other hand, can nor- mally play ...O-O at some point because he sel- dom castles queenside in these Sicilian lines. So by traditional theory, Black should be even more reluctant to push pawns on the kingside in cases where their advance doesn't come with tempo or with tactical intent. Nevertheless, Black bas recently turned towards the surpris- ing move ...h5, which is both weakening and nondeveloping. It is nevertheless quintessen- tially pragmatic, i.c., it prevents g4! The ad- vance ...h5 dramatically violates the traditional strictures against unforced and weakening pawn moves, especially those on the side of the board for which the king is most likely destined. Bui there is a growing nonchalance about early cas- tling when one's own positional goals (nor- mally on the queenside) can be given some extra time to develop. What's more, a little space on the kingside can prove useful. I will give a considerable number of examples of this now common prophylactic idea: Hratek- FtaSnrk Czech League 2000/1

T for the surprise.

Af- ter that game, the next instance Hansen finds of ...h5 in the Sicilian was not until the 1960s in a game by Simagin! Hansen thinks that Sim- agin, who tried out the idea several times, was the first to understand that ...h5 could be pri- marily a positional and not just an attacking move. This notion was taken up by Filipowicz and a few others in the 1970s, with a gradual in- crease in interest thereafter that took off in the 1990s. The game Ponomariov-Zviagintsev, which we discussed above, provides one example from the Scheveningen, the set-up that Bogoljubow employed. Here is another: Zwanzger- Podzielny Bechhofen }998

To illustrate this, 1 have tried to emphasize thematic situa- tions and types of positions that weren11 already covered in SOMCS But one should remember that such pawn advances are appearing in well- known older structures as well as in uniquely modem openings. I urge the reader to keep an eye out in his studies for more examples reflect- ing this changing philosophy. 1 don't think that you will play over too many games in contem- porary chess before running into instances of flank pawn advances that most players would hardly have been contemplated until the last 10-20 years, and quite a few that were unheard of before the last five.

2.2 Doubled Pawns In Action
The treatment of doubled pawns has become increasingly complex in our times. As a broad characterization, we can say that the unifying factors of the modem treatment are retention of maximum structural flexibility and a general open-mindedness. More than ever, players are willing to enter into positions in which they have doubled pawns, even when it means re- taining them for much of the game without prospect of liquidation. Conversely, players arc more willing to sacrifice positive tactical and positional factors in order to create doubled pawns in the opponent's camp. Those factors might include time, development, the bishop- pair, safety and the like. It's all a matter of spe- cific context, and there don't seem to be many general guidelines. Specific structures and for- mations may allow of doubled pawns while others tend to suffer from them. Yet even in those cases, delicate issues of timing and initia- tive can intervene and make general assess- ments unreliable. In short, the ideas are in the moves themselves. What is clear is that the stronger players are expert at drawing upon their vast experience to assess which side they favour and thus when to enter into a doubled-pawn situation. Opening structures are as usual important teachers. Of course, most opening variations do not involve doubled pawns early on, if only because the op- posing forces do not engage one another for some time. It also takes two to tango, so both the doubler and doublee must see advantages in their positions. Normally there must be a planned effort to create or provoke the creation of doubled pawns early on, and that's precisely what we are seeing more and more of today. In many situations, players no longer view dou- bled pawns as weaknesses to be compensated for but as natural or even positive features of the position. Because doubled pawn play has be- come so widespread, 1 will concentrate upon a few illustrative structures and some ideas that weren't discussed in SOMCS, The Extension of Doubled Pawn Theory I can't give enough credit to GM Peter Wells's subtle and extended discussion of doubled pawns in Chess Base Magazine 80 (CBM is a collec- tion of games and articles on CD), in which he brings forth theoretical details that weren't dis- cussed in SOMCS and that haven't been cov- ered in any other book or source that I know of. Remarkably, his many excellent examples were taken from a single issue of the magazine, an indication of how common these ideas are! I will borrow a couple of these first before moving on to my own selection of themes and games. Rogozenko - Morozevich Istanbul OL 2000 In this position, Black threatens to continue ,., ,g4 and bring his rooks to the central files. So White demurs from taking pawns in order to develop. At the cost of a certain weakening of his kingside, he drives Black's queen to the side of the board and prepares to castle by hand.

The computer, indoctrinated with classical principles, assesses White as better here. Welk more accurately secs this as a clear black ad- vantage. White would normally push his king- side pawns, say, by g4-g5 in order to activate his pieces if nothing else. Now that can't be done. By contrast, Black's queenside majority is strong: not because it is on the queenside (White's king is not far away), but because it is mobile and will eventually produce a passed pawn. It is also very important that White will be tied to defence of dl and d2 and thus ren- dered relatively immobile. 24TMc5 25 Ne2 Nb3 26 fif4 *g7 27 g4!? It's hard to know what to do. 27 Zg4+ Bf8

Wells: fcl What I wonder is how many players simply would fail even to seriously examine 21 ...Rf6! because taking on such doubled, isolated pawns goes against deeply ingrained instincts. In fact, these pawns easily contain White's majority, while Black obtains total control on the other wing." This is one of Wells's themes: doubled pawns can be excel- lent restrainers of a majority. After all, when one pawn is exchanged the other takes its place! Conversely, he makes the (better-known) point that "a doubled pawn on the majority side is in general a far greater burden since it profoundly complicates the task of creating a passed pawn." As for Wells's question of how many play- ers would consider ...Rf6, I'm pretty sure that I wouldn't! On the other hand, it's easy enough to imagine this move from any number of po- sitionally-minded grandmasters (and surely top ones like Kramnik or Karpov), particularly since the taboos against doubled pawns even in sim- plified positions is disappearing.

Doubled Pawns in Pairs Increasingly often we sec the assumption of two sets of doubled pawns by one side. This subject deserves its own article. A decision to take on such an apparent burden is usually based upon the same pragmatic considerations as with one pair of doubled pawns. The possi- bility of direct attack aside, one can acquire ad- ditional open files, protect key squares, and gain space. In SOMCS, we showed two exam- ples of Botvinnik playing with one set of dou- bled pawns. With that kind of play he and his contemporaries brought a key part of modem positional strategy to the forefront. In the fol- lowing example, White engages in a more radi- cal version of these ideas. Botvinnik - Levenfish WS57? Cft (Moscow) 1940

White's play may thus appear thoroughly anti-positional, but it has its own positive points, such as three open files versus one and the prospect of gaining space in the centre and on the kingside. Also, some of what he is doing is purely pragmatic and position- specific, as we shall see. 13 f4! A typical Botvinnik space-grab. This stops Black playing ...Ne5, and Botvinnik assesses his newly-created backward pawns as relatively unexploitable.

Sometimes this is done in or- der to establish outposts for the knight-pair, but not always. We often sec such a pawn break to further one's piece coordination or to open lines against a vulnerable point in the enemy camp. An older game illustrates this idea: Stein - Matulovic Soiww? ZZ 1967

in this variation is exceptionally interesting. The revival of White's enthusiasm for iLb5 and J$Lxc6 has come in part because of the discov- ery that one needn't pursue traditional ideas with respect to either minors piece treatment or majority/minority issues, I want to compare a number of examples with these themes. Glek - Lemmers Belgium 1995 Ie4c5 2Qf3"k6 3 b5 g6 4 O-O Ng7 5 Bel e5 6 J .xc6 dxc6 7 d3 In general Black has a solid position that is difficult to attack. If White tries to enforce <14, he will run into the _..c5 + ...e5 bind along with pressure down the d-file. 8a3 This move intending b4 is the key idea we will investigate, one that White here initiates before developing any other pieces. It has been quite successful in practice, and I believe that it is superior to the other plans more frequently employed in these types of positions, 8,"O-O 9 b4 cxb4 10 axb4 (D) The simplest and probably even the best so luti on. Although White's pieces look passive, his bishops could have come alive rapidly after e4, and the idea of Qb4 d5 would be particu larly awkward to meet. 10 cxdS WxdS 11 e4 Rc5 Ihis is equal. Black is ahead in development and is making it hard for White to get castled.
9...d5 is an example of how when one pos-
sesses the knight-pair one should often open the position quickly. But it is also an example of liquidating a forward doubled pawn both to challenge its grip on a square and to expose the weakness of the pawn behind it, 12 e2! O-O 13 Re3 Rxe3+ 14 4Bxe3 b6 15 c4 Jka6 1" Ac3 BfdS! 17 4\15

Doesn't this favour his bishops? After all, White cannot even be said to have exposed any weaknesses in his opponent's position. But in fact, White has acted quickly before Black can reorganize his pieces and exploit the two-bishops advantage at his leisure. Notice that the c7-knight and g7- bishop are restricted. With 9 b4, White opens up the a-file and can put pressure on the queen- side. Just as importantly, the moves Ae3 or

Examples from Modern Play Sticking with the 3 Ab5 Sicilian Defence and doubled pawns, the following game contains a number of themes from this book: Sergeev - Moroz Ordzhonikidze 2001 1 e4c5 2 5tf3 3 Nb5 e64 Nxc6 bxc6 5 d3 Qe7 6 h4! (D) 13 b4! Once again opening up Che position for the knights and cooperatively liquidating Black's doubled pawns. Wells's comment is: "This helps to explain a phenomenon, which otherwise ap- pears quite paradoxical ...As in the Exchange Variation of the Spanish, White, facing the dou- bled pawn and the two bishops decides to open the position, in this case even liquidating the doubled pawns into the bargain. Practice has shown us that time and again the knight-pair make little headway against the doubled pawns in a closed position." After 13 b4 in this game, Black's interior weaknesses arc exposed, al- though as we have seen in other examples it tends to be a good move whether or not a spe- cific target is created.
13."cxb4 14 axb4! Be6 15 d4!
Yet another line-opening move. This opens the c-file and strengthens While's dark-square bind. White will soon exploit both factors, with a winning advantage. I5...exd4 16 cxd4 TBT>7 17 2k3 SfeS 18 Af4 ftd7 19 Nd6 Nc4 20 e5 Now things are clear.

This move could be included in our discus- sion of flank pawn advances. Here the main idea is prophylactic: Black's plan in this posi- tion is ...Qg6, ...O-O, and to meet e5 by ...f6. Now
6...Qg6? runs into 7 h5. Conceivably White
might also want to expand further by h5-h6 in the right circumstances.
6...h5
Sergeev offers 6...f61? 7 1? d6 8 c3 'in- tending d4 with a small advantage'. As usual, White will liquidate his opponent's doubled pawns by d4 both to open lines and use his mo- bile centre to create outposts for his knights. Here he has more time than usual because Black's pieces are so cramped and the knight won't be happy on g6; for example, 8...Qg6 (8...Hb8 9 Qbd2! with the idea 9...Hxb2? 10 Nb3) 9 d4 cxd4 10 cxd4 h5 (10...Ne7 11 h5 Qf8 12 1ffc2) 11 HFc2 with good prospects. 7e5!? This is the more traditional strategy of fixing Black's doubled pawns and making c4 and e4 into at least pseudo-outposts for his knights. Black normally successfully contests this via

14 O-O-O (D)
Sergeev proposes 14 Zh3!? with the idea Zg3, but 14...Zh6 15 Zg3 still looks equal. Black has taken over the initiative with his active bishops and rooks. If White plays 21 <347,
21...Qa5 22 4b 1 c3 and ...cxb2 gives Black a
strong attack and activity. This example epito- mizes the most common situation with the knight-pair versus bishop-pair; if the side with knights can open lines quickly before the bish- ops coordinate (here by 15 flhgl !), there's a good probability of success. But if the bishops get enough time, they will usually find a way to become the better pieces, as happened here.

In Curt Hansen's terrific ChessBase Mag- azine article called Inventors of Modem Chess 2\ he finds 13 examples of giving up the bish- ops for such pawns previous to 1935, with a real explosion in the 1950s that has yet to cease. Remember that those pre-1935 examples are for a period in which the database selection is notoriously limited. On the other hand, if we look at those examples the doubling of pawns sometimes proved unsuccessful, and several of them were purely pragmatic captures with an instant reward, and thus nowhere near as com- mittal or risky as those we see today. Without going any further, it might be worth just listing a subset of the openings in which this particul ar creation of such doubled isolated c-pawns commonly arise: a) The Accelerated Dragon Sicilian with, e.g., 1 e4 c5 2 fif3 ?k6 3 d4 cxd4 4 2frd4 g6 5 c4 kg7 6 43c2 d6 7 ?3c3 J&,xc3+ 8 bxc3, and the Hyper-Accelerated Dragon Sicilian with 1 c4 c5 2 Qf3 g6 3 d4 Ng7 4 dxc5 Qa5+ 5 2Bc3 -fi-xc3+ 6 bxc3. b) Its cousin the Rubinstein Variation of the English, given above, with 1 c4 c5 2 4k3 ?Bf6 3 g3 d5 4 cxd5 ?3xd5 5 jtg2 4k7, and now many versions including 6 lffb3 and 6 Qf3 7 d3 e5 8 Nd2 Nc7 9 Qc4 f6 10 Nxc64 bxc6. c) A large number of King's Indian forma- tions, an older one being 1 d4 Nf6 2 c4 g6 3 Nc3 Bg7 4 e4 O-O 5 Ne2 d6 6Qlf3 Ng4 7 0X1 Stfd7 8 Ne3 Nc6 9 d5 Nxf3 10 Nxf3 fta5 11 Ra4 Jixc3 12 bxc3 b6, a formation occurring in Geller and Spassky's games.

The result may be that the c8-bishop is imprisoned and White can slowly build up on the kingside or in the centre, I refer the reader to SOMCS for a complete example (Larsen-Betancourt, Lan- zarote 1976). It might be of interest that Hansen finds precedent for this ultra-modern strategy in games by both Portisch and Smyslov; e.g., 1 c4 c5 2 4\z3 g6 3 g3 J"Lg7 4 Jtg2 4k6 5 Qf3 d6

itf4 Mc3 11 bxc3, Golombek-Portisch, Zagreb 1965. For those cases in which the doubled pawns aren't isolated, Wells makes the important dis- tinction between: a) unsupported doubled pawns, such as in the numerous Nimzo-Indian lines with ...Mc3 which leave c4 weak (1 d4 Qf6 2 c4 e6 3 Jlb4 4 a3 Mc3+ 5 bxc3, for example); and b) supported doubled pawns with no such glaring weaknesses, as arises after 1 c4 4hf6 2 #Ac3 e6 3 $Yf3 _M4 4 g3 Jkxc3 5 bxc3, for ex- ample, when a pawn on d3 can defend against any threat to c4. Note that the jLg2 + Jkxc6 examples in the preceding paragraph only created supported doubled pawns that were easily defensible, which makes the idea all the more remarkable. Regarding the various situations, let me make the obvious explicit: to the side that creates the doubled pawns, the case of isolated doubled pawns is the most attractive, followed by the case of unsupported pawns, and lastly the case of supported pawns. What's interesting, how- ever, is how very popular it has become to in- flict even supported doubled pawns upon the opponent, as w'e shall see below. Let's turn to some particular structures to illustrate the ideas involved. I should also make brief mention the truly radical Jkg2xc6 and ...Bg7xc3 ideas that dou- ble but don't isolate the c-pawns. As mentioned in SOMCS, this was a Larsen speciality; as early as the mid-1970s, he played three games along the lines similar to 1 g3 g6 2 Jikg2 Jkg7 3 c4 c5 4 41c3 4k6 5 b3 e6 6 Mc6 bxc6 7 _fi_b2 (D) of Larsen-Andersson, Las Palmas 1974: This is certainly the ultimate in the rfian- chettoed bishop captures knight' philosophy, because Black's pawns protect one another and he has no exploitable weaknesses. Meanwhile, White's own kingside light-square problems look serious, and it is remarkable that he could have good play. Nevertheless, Black's bishops can ultimately be neutralized by a prophylactic policy. His desirable structure with ...d6 and Doubled f-Pawns The various instantiations of supported dou- bled pawns present a broad and fascinating field. Today, for example, the occurrence of doubled f-pawns has risen dramatically in a wide variety of openings both classical and modem. In particular, players are more willing
120 CHESS STRATEGY IN ACTION
to defy traditional precepts and capture away from the centre by cxf3 or ...exf6. This type of capture will be my main concern. But before di- recting your attention that way, I should point out that even f-pawn captures towards the cen- tre are an increasing modem era phenomenon. Take, for example, the Sveshnikov Variation of the Sicilian (1 e4 c5 2 Qf3 4Bc6 3 d4 cxd4 4 2\xd4 ftf6 5 Qc3 e5 6 £kib5 d6 7 Ng5 a6 8 Qa3 b5 9 J ,xf6 gxf6 (D)) and various related lines. Nevertheless, captures mvny from the centre are particularly radical in the sense that the ma- jority of them wouldn't have been allowed by one side or the other in the not -too -distart past. These new lines constitute the material for the latest debates over the advantages and dis- advantages of doubled pawns. Such captures, after all, involve a crippling of one's own ma- jority, which one would think would be a more serious defect than the analogous doubling of c-pawns: Note that these f-pawns are unsupported. When one takes that into account, and then fac- tors in Black's backward d6-pawn on an open file, it's not surprising that the old masters (or even ones up to the 1970s) weren't disposed to get anywhere near the Sveshnikov, which is now an extraordinarily popular and effective variation. Other Sicilian variations, notably the Rauzer and the Najdorf with Ag5, often in- volve doubled, supported, f-pawns after Jtxf6 and ,..gxf6, since Black's c-pawn will be either at e7 or e6. Today we see things Uke 1 d4 d6 2 Jlg4 3 c4 xf3 4 gxf3 or variations with ."Bb7, ...jLxf3 and gxf3 with increasing frequency. Numerous examples arise in a main line of the French Defence Tarrasch Variation that goes 1 e4 e6 2 d4 d5 3 Nd2 c5 4 exdS xd5 5 £gf3 cxd4 6 kc4 Rd6 7 O-O 8 "Bb3 9 \Libxd4 Nxd4 10 Qxd4 with an early iLg5 and iLxf6 answered by ...gxf6 (those pawns arc supported ones when and if ...f5 is played). Even relatives of the very old French Bum Variation with 1 e4 e6 2d4 d5 3 #k3 dxe4 4 #W4 Qf6 5 J&.g5 JfiLe7 6 Jixf6 gxf6 (similarly supported) are being reinvestigated. And so forth. The diagrams clarify this: when one takes on the doubled f-pawns it is normally with the ap- proximate resulting structure in the first dia- gram. One has then allowed the opponent a rather dangerous mobile majority, and without good prospects of a queenside minority attack in return, because ...c5 can so often be an- swered by d5. In the case of doubled c-pawns, we know from experience that the opponent's kings ide majority will have a difficult time

Here a standard strategy for White is to undouble these pawns by h3 and g4, while Black prevents that by ,..h5. In each of these cases Wells's phrase 'sup- ported doubled pawns* applies due to the adja- cent g-pawn. It is worth noting that in a large database, openings with this f7+f5 structure score 52% for White and 48% for Black, with only a 40-point rating difference in perfor- mance. This is better than Black normally does. In databases of lop masters only, the result var- ies dramatically by the specific line employed; e.g., the Nimzo-Indian 4 c2 d5 5 cxd5 Rxd5
6 Nf3 W'fS has done very well (50%-50%), but
the overall result with all such doubled f-pawn pairs for Black is better than normal for White at 58%M2%, indicating that in some positions these pawns are simply a disadvantage. Re- versing the colours, however, we find that in positions with white pawns at f2 and f4, also among strong players. White has a nice 55 %- 45% score. Both results include fewer draws than usual, so it's fair to say that these figures mainly demonstrate that the lines are unbal- anced, and that if one includes all occurrences of this type of doubled f-pawns, they will prove disadvantageous in only slightly more cases than they prove to be helpful. This is surely a remarkable conclusion for such traditionally frowned-upon 'crippled* pawns. It turns out that they have compensating qualities that arc not apparent at first. One of them is the ability of the rear pawn to cover extra central squares, and to fulfil the same functions as the forward pawn in cases where that pawn has been ex- changed. Such an abstract discussion needs to be sup- plemented by actual play. I will present a few examples of some better-established strategies and then turn to something a little more experi- mental. The Trompowsky Attack with 1 d4 4Bf6 2 Bg5 d5 3 Bxf6 cxf6 (followed by some forma- tion with ...f5) has been played by many lead* ing players. Kasparov has won two games with it as Black, and AJmasi, Tiviakov, Korchnoi arc among others who have used it. An unexciting advancing since the king (in this case White's) would be exposed thereby. Hence, by the way, one motivation for White's paradoxical a3 + b4 queenside plan versus the 3 itb5 Sicilian ear- lier in this section: his prospects reside in a cen- tral rather than a kingside majority. Thus the possessor of the doubled f-pawns needs to jus- tify his choice and establish his chances earlier in the middlegame. Some examples below will illustrate this difference. Doubled c-pawns that arise from capture away from the centre occur in many openings, including classical ones such the Ruy Lopez, for example in the Exchange Variation and the recently revitalized Berlin Defence. One could even see 1 e4 e5 2 Qf3 Nc6 3 Bb5 a6 as a bold challenge to White to inflict doubled pawns on Black's position, ones that cripple his majority after ...dxc6. The Scotch Ganic provides us with a knight exchange resulting in the same structure after 1 e4 e5 2 Nf3 ?5c6 3 d4 exd4 4 Bxd4 Bc5 5 ftxcfi Rf6 6 Rd2 dxc6. The re- verse-colour situation with White playing dxc3 is also common, e.g., after ..._Nb4 and ...Bxc3 in various lines of the English Opening, and we also see dxc3 variations after the exchange of a knight on d5 for one on c3. But the theoretical superiority of the doubled c- pawn-structure over that of the f-pawns (dia- grammed above) hasn't necessarily led to more success with the former, as illustrated by the widespread use of openings with the latter structure. This is the case even when the dou- bled pawns have no prospect of being liqui- dated in the short term. Here are just a few of the openings (many of them unknown or un- popular before modem times) in which strong players intentionally bead for doubled f-pawn positions: a) Nimzo-Indian Defence with 1 d4 Qf6 2 c4e6 3ftc3 Nb4 4 Rc2 d5 5 cxd5 4?xd5 6 £tf3 fff5 7 Rxf5 exf5. b) Trompowsky Attack with 1 d4 Nf6 2 JLgS d5 3 JLxffi exf6, normally followed by ...f5. c) Modem Systems with 1 d4 d6 2 4)f3 Jkg4

124 CHESS STRATEGY IN ACTION
Here are some examples featuring the same pawn-structure in the Slav Defence, This is a variation that was used rarely and very unsuc- cessfully up to the 1990s, when players real- ized that it had a number of desirable posi- tional characteristics, in particular the restraint of White's centre. In some early games, Black tried to exchange off his doubled f-pawn via ...f4, which actually weakened his position. Now he simply brings his pieces out and finds the doubled pawns quite useful. This variation has been taken up by players at the highest level and has gained full respectability. Poluliakhov- Koba Ii ya Moscow Geller mem 1999 how doubled pawns don't have to be looked upon as burdens, but can justify themselves in- dependently. As Wells says, ",..the discussion [of doubled pawns] tends to focus on the 'com- pensation1, important for sure, but liable to blur rather than clarify the characteristics of the pawns themselves." 100-0 In a manner reminiscent of the moves a3 and b4 versus Black's doubled pawns at c6 and c5 in the Bb5 Sicilians above, White can play

Black's theoretical weakness! This is associ- ated with a direct attack, but also has to do with loosening Black's grip on e4; for example, 10 ,h5?

This version of the doubled f-pawns isn't quite as safe as that of the Nimza-Indian exam- ple above because the queens remain on the board and White has some attacking ideas. But in the best-played games, Black holds his own because the f5-pawn exerts important influence over e4 in conjunction with an open file, The knight-pair is not a serious disadvantage, since both e4 and d5 are pseudo-outposts created by Black's pawn-structure.

Hbl c6 13 b3 Bc7 14 Ab2 The game is equal. All of the examples above have to do with bishop's pawns. As we move out towards the edge of the board to the knight's and rook's files, capturing away from the centre is much less common. Nevertheless, pragmatic players are not disposed to reject such captures when useful. In the Sicilian Defence, for example, we very often see the move exb3 (after, e.g., ." Lxb3 or ...ftxb3) holding up Black's queenside at- tack, a factor that is often of decisive impor- tance after White plays O-O-O. An analogous situation is in the Nimzo-Indian/Qucen's In- dian line that goes 1 <14 £\f6 2 c4 e6 3 Nc3 Ab4

Doubled Pawns on the Rook's File Finally, doubled pawns that result from cap- tures of pieces on the rook's file (all away from the centre, obviously) are quite a fascinating topic. I discussed in SOMCS the familiar ,,.bxa6 pawn recapture of a bishop that has taken a knight on a6. This opens the b-file for Black and can often lead to active piece play in addi- tion to winning the bishop-pair. The idea is found in openings such as the Benoni, Pirc, and King's Indian. One might also note the recur- rent theme of ...b6 and ...Qa5 in the Sicilian Defence, usually when White has a knight on b3. The idea of ".Na5 to set up the useful move ...Cic4, but after Qxa5, the recapture ...bxa5 opens the b-file to good effect. Even the for- ward doubled a-pawn covers b4 and can often advance to create further queenside problems for White. Needless to say, doubling and iso- lating the a-pawns while eliminating the minor- ity attack by ."b5-b4 looks outrageously anti- positional to traditionalists, and was hardly considered for many years. But then forty to fifty years ago this idea burst into popularity and has remained a standard stratagem ever since.

Now standard stuff. The remarkable thing is that if you look at all the similar lines in ECO, you will very seldom even see White's option of ftxa5 mentioned!

In the Fischer game, White didn't allow that, but ultimately it was Black's unopposed light -squared bishop that won the game. But going back to our main game, Black doesn't even have the two bishops! So can he possibly expect real counterplay? Yet he has achieved it in practice for several rea- sons: White's dark squares are weak due to the move f3; Black has good development; and the ...f5 break can potentially compromise White's centre or activate more pieces. Finally, the forward doubled pawn can be useful in attack- ing White's kingsidc, perhaps in conjunction with the g-filc.

This kind of manoeuvre allowing the dou- hied and isolated pawns in front of one's king has become common enough that advanced players don't react much one way or another upon seeing it. The thing is to sec whether the concrete lines work out for one side or another. But we forget how shocking such an idea was even to many GMs as recently as 1972, when a famous Spas sky- Fischer game from the Reyk- javik World Championship match went 1 d4 Nf6 2 c4 e6 3 Nf3 c5 4 d5 exd5 5 cxd5 d6 6 5 3 g6 7 4M2 £bd7 8 e4 Ag7 9 Ae2 O-O 10 O-O He8 1 1 Rc2 Nh5!? 12 Axh5 gxh5, an idea of Boleslavsky's that gained Fischer a precious point.

The broader lesson is that players arc well served to be open-minded about doubled pawns, both as to the desirability of inflicting them upon the opponent and the strengths doubled pawns may exhibit. Some- times, as a number of the most modern open- ings demonstrate, it's worth going to quite a lot of trouble in terms of time, space, or piece qual- ity to create doubled pawns in the enemy camp. At other times one can happily accept doubled pawns which serve various useful functions such as covering key squares. It is important to note, as Wells does, that in such cases it need not be merely a matter of 'compensation' for doubled pawns, e.g. in the form of open files, the bishop-pair, space or whatever - they may be of superior value in and of themselves. What can be said with confidence is that modem players are taking both sides of a rapidly in- creasing number of positions with doubled pawns. Considerable experience with particu- lar positions and related ones only accelerate this trend, and we should certainly expect it to continue for years to come. advances that take place on the wing not yet contested; Black would like to play ...h4-h3 in some lines) 20 Sei e6 21 h4 $)g4 22 Sc2 Sd5 !

2.3 The Positional Pawn Sacrifice
In a fashion similar to the phenomena of early flank attacks and exchange sacrifices, the fre- quency of positional pawn sacrifices has in- creased almost beyond belief. Kasparov talks about the new attitude towards material among younger players, a movement that he claims to be a leader of. Indeed he consistently enters into pawn sacrifices in positions where the compensation would have previously been re- garded as insufficient or too abstract; and many, many leading masters (including older ones!) seem to have changed along with him- Grand- masters are finding positions of all types in which they are willing to invest a pawn for long-term compensation, sacrifices that would have seemed too long-term just 30-40 years ago. This is one of the most obvious trends that one will run into as one compares eras* One will also find a great increase in pawn sacri- fices that lead directly to attacks, but those are readily understandable and not so much in the realm of strategy, so 1 won't be examining them here. In a recent interview Spassky answers a ques- tion as to what the differences are between the chess of the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s from that of today He says "Nowadays the dynamic ele- ment is more important in chess - players more often sacrifice material to obtain dynamic com- pensation. Of course, such players were in my generation too and they existed before (for ex- ample, Alekhine), but then fewer people played like that than now" In my opinion, players in the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s were already play- ing much more dynamically than in the 1900- 1930 period, and it was indeed Alekhine who began to break down barriers with respect to material imbalance. Probably that movement slowed (but didn't stop) during the 1950s under the influence of Botvinnik and Smyslov; and developed more rapidly during the next few de- cades* But one didn't see the almost routine po- sitional pawn sacrifice take over until recent times. I believe that this is an extremely important subject for understanding modem chess, but it is almost impossible to illustrate sufficiently, since the instantiations are so varying and ubiq- uitous. I will therefore show a set of pawn sacri- fices, mostly unspectacular, that caught my eye in the course of gathering material recently. While various modem openings involve early positional pawn sacrifices (e.g., the Benko Gam- bit, which I discuss in SOMCS), I will concen- trate mainly upon middlegame positions. I will also discuss a type of opening complex that was considered rather dull but has been enlivened in modem times by long-term sacrifices, The reader is strongly encouraged Io look for fur- ther examples, which he will find in abundance just by playing through random master games. If you have ChessBase, one can facilitate this task by using the search mask and the 'Mate- rial' theme key. Assorted Examples Many positional pawn sacrifices involve gain- ing the advantage of the two bishops. This game was played in the mid-1960s and seems in the style of Botvinnik* GEgorid demonstrates his faith in the bishop-pair even in a simplified po- sition with weaknesses: Gligorid- Matanovld Titograd 1965

There are so many modem pawn sacrifices in the openings that it's fun to turn to a tradi- tional gambit. The King's Gambit has always had a certain following, with Nigel Short and Alexei Fedorov being the most prominent prac- titioners in the 1990s. The modem approach, emphasizing positional gains over all-out at- tack, gained currency with David Bronstein's adoption of the opening, and for the most part continues today. In this game and many others, White turns the gambit into a long-term posi- tional pawn sacrifice. 2,..exf4 3 Nf3 d6 4 d4 g5 5 h4 g4 6 Qgl i.h6 7 Qc3 c6 8 Q ge2 Bf6 9 g3 fxg3 10 4}xg3 £xci 11 Excl Bh6 (D) Qxd2+ 14 Bxd2 4kl7 (compare the game: there White is better developed; here he has plenty of compensation, but Black's weaknesses are bal- anced by his extra pawn) 15 Ecfl Qb6 16 b3 Ne6 17 Qce2 d5 18 e5 0 O-O 19 ti5 Edg8 20 2)f4 (Bangiev suggests 20 Sf4!?

Kasparov's Pawn Sacrifices Now I will perhaps bore you with too many ex- amples from the king of the modem pawn sacri- fice. But we'll actually be examining just a sample of the multitudinous pawn offers from the games of Kasparov, normally both position- ally and tactically motivated. These are chosen from early in his career up to the present. Iftc sacrifices very often lead to winning attacks, but they are also fundamentally strategic in nature, Kasparov - Marjanovit Maha OL 1980

He adds, admitting a touch of exaggera- tion, that "a knight on f5 nearly always justifies a pawn sacrifice"! V, Georgiev - Aleksic Cutro 2001 Wells draws attention to this fairly inno- cent-looking position. Black's doubled pawns arc not yet a problem. 15 b4!

Interestingly, the same fellow making this sacrifice argues that most of Tai's combinations would be refuted today by top grandmasters ''be- cause the defensive technique is on an absolutely different level".

Kasparov re- marks that pawn sacrifices of this type are fre- quently seen in GM games today as opposed to traditional chess and even in contrast to the par- tially Karpov-influenced style of the 1980s. In his words, llthe new generation says that initia- tive can be worth material and that this is more appreciated than before." He claims that he himself "contributed to the changing philoso- phy". Indeed, I remember being surprised time and again by Kasparov's early pawn sacrifices, which were quite unlike ones that I was used to. But these are fast-moving times, and today such a sacrifice looks almost routine and is often passed over without even an T , so deeply have such ideas penetrated our thinking. 16"Jtxc3 17fiedl No hurry,

out of situations that are dynamically unbal- anced to begin with. Nevertheless, we are seeing them of late in the most solid and innocent of set-ups. Traditionally, English and Reti Open- ing lines involving ...c6 + ...d5 or .,.c6 + ,..d5 have been relatively immune to early pawn sacrifices by White because Black's pawn- structure is devoid of weaknesses. The next two games and notes indicate that modem players nevertheless will often sacrifice pawns in these openings, ignoring the material deficit in fa- vour of long-term pressure. Characteristic of these pawn sacrifices is that they bring no im- mediate rewards. In the next game one can see a few of many ways that White can make a positional gambit versus a black defence with 41.c6, ...d5 and ...dxc4, such as we are about to see: Now that White has his pawn back, things become pretty easy.

2.4 Majorities and Minorities at War
In SOMCS, I posited that the old notion of the advantage of the queenside majority was losing its relevance and mentioned that modem games abound in positions where one side or the other happily accepts a pawn minority. I pointed out that "Such minorities may even constitute an advantage as late as the early stages of the end- game'1 and that a strong consideration is that the possession of a queenside majority tends to mean the ceding of a central majority I now be- lieve that the situation is more subtle than ex- pressed there. In a sense, I underestimated the case for the pawn minority. Even in the end- game, for example, a centralized king pretty much neutralizes the advantage of a potential outside passed pawn, and in fact a central ma- jority can often be the superior one. Ironically, however, it is not the inherent strength of White's majority that gives him chances, but (he difficulty that Black has in achieving the queen side minority structure! Daniel King wrote an extremely interesting article on this subject in ChessBase Magazine. He points out, first of all, that the most typical majority- versus- minority position, and indeed one of the most common pawn- structures aris- ing in modem chess, is that with Black having four pawns versus White's three on the kingsidc and White having three pawns versus Black's two on the queenside: Obviously a white pawn could be on c3 or c4, black pawns on a6 or b6, or any number of variations (similarly on the kingsidc). But to emphasize how often this pawn-structure arises, consider these examples, several given by King and the rest by me: Variations of the French Defence; for exam- ple: a) Le4e6 2d4d5 3 d2c5 4exd5Bxd5 5 Qgf3 cxd4 6 Ac4 Rd6 7 O-O Qc6 8 Nb3 9 2ibxd4. b) I e4 efi 2 d4 d5 3 Nd2 (or 3 Sk3 Qf6 4 Bg5 dxe4 5 Qxe4 ftbd7 6 Qf3 h6 7 #W6+ 4Bxf6 8 Bh4 c5 followed by ...cxd4 or dxc5)

King mentions that such structures can also arise from the Queen's Indian Defence and Alekhine's Defence, and I don't doubt that there are others (the Colle Opening has a main line with dxc5 and c4, for example, after which ...dxe4 yields the structure mentioned; this is analogous with the Semi-Slav Defence). King's comment: 'There was perhaps a time when certain dogmatic thinkers would imagine that White had the advantage in such positions due to his 'queenside pawn majority', and OC' casionally it does occur that White succeeds in creating a dangerous passed pawn. However, first there is the middlegame to negotiate; and second, even in the endgame, in my experience, it is Black's central pawn majority which plays the more crucial role in the game." I would add that the variations above are all fully playable for Black (1 will ignore the Semi-Slav case in order to refer to 'White' as having the queen- side majority and 'Black* as having the queen - side minority). That itself is a good sign for the minority. However, I would add that White's play in all of these lines usually comes from piece play, and such play can be extremely effective in- deed, The key thing to note is that White's ad- vantage stems from his faster development and command in space, not from his structure. In fact, the results of many of the above opening variations is either equal or slightly better for White because Black has intentionally paid a price (said development and space) for what he feels is the advantageous queen side minor- ity situation! It is also worth mentioning that White, by means of moves like Qie5 or dou- bling on the e-file, will normally keep Black's majority under wraps indefinitely, so neither side has serious prospects for successful expan- sion. The Effective Minority Before moving on to my own examples, let's look at one that King supplies to illustrate the basic majority- minority theme. The following middlegame works out well for Black, although one should be aware that White normally does not allow his opponent such a free hand to ad- vance in the centre: 34 ?kil g4 35 *e2 c4!?

As noted above, White will very often stand better in these variations in spite of his queenside ma- jority rather than because of it. This comes about because he tends to be quite a bit ahead in development by the time that Black manages to exchange his c- and d-pawns for White's d- and e-pawns. Here are typical examples of White gaining an advantage in the popular ...dxe4 variations of the French Defence, although it's worth keeping in mind that Black had opportu- nities to equalize.

3 The Pieces in Action
3.1 An Edgy Day and Sleepless Knight
The knight is in many ways the most mysteri- ous piece. We can all sympathize with the be- ginner's first reaction: why can't it just move along linear files and diagonals like the other pieces? Even today, its nature is controversial; grandmasters, for example, seem to be of two minds about its strengths and weaknesses. Just when the bishop appears to have triumphed over its counterpart - and the phrase 'a bad bishop is better than a good knight' has often been heard of late - the knight shows surpris- ing strength in a position from which it has no traditional advantages. And lengthy, time- consuming knight manoeuvres that never seem to end can result in the most amazing transfor- mation of the game. I will dub these heroic wanderers 'sleepless knights', in honour of the fact that they never seem able to find rest at any particular spot. Their one-horse expeditions can end in absurd ruin or in triumph, but in either case do not always lend themselves to rational analysis. See the end of this section for enter- taining and hopefully instructive examples. In SOMCS I talked at considerable length about the degree to which masters have become more pragmatic in their treatment of knights. Most noticeably, modem players increasingly place and keep their knights on the edge of the board in defiance of the precept that they are poorly placed there ('knights on the rim are grim'). Of course, very few standard openings are dominated by such knight placements; but almost all of them include multiple instances in which the knights are best situated on the pe- riphery of the board. Since dispatching one's knights in such a manner is so often a success- ful strategy, one must question whether the general rule against perimeter knights can get in the way of correct play. Rather than carry around a prejudice that doesn't have validity in many important types of positions, I have sug- gested that players arc much better off assess- ing the situation on a case-by-case basis and using their experience, analysis and intuition to help them make decisions. In fact, this is what the great majority of masters do. Such a practi- cal and fine-tuned approach contrasts with the 'rule and exception' model, which would be ar- tificial and limiting in terms of understanding what's actually happening on the board. Eccentric Knights in Double e-Pawn Openings One criticism that was levelled at this idea was that the rule against knights on the edge applied to the types of positions, mostly double c-pawn, that were being played in the era when the rule was formed. Thus the idea that an attachment to (he abstract principle limited the players of that age is unfair. One good answer to this is that if players today are less inhibited about placing knights on the rim they will almost by defini- tion find and be willing to enter more positions of that type. But beyond that, one might legiti- mately ask whether the knight-on- the-edge rule war formed due to an old insight relating to double e-pawn openings. This doesn't seem likely; in fact the opposite seems to be true. In some of the best-established Open Games, knights go to and often stay on the edge of the board, and they did so in previous eras as well.
AN EDGY DAY AND SLEEPLESS KNIGHT 157
For example, we have the main line of the Two Knights Opening: 1 e4 e5 2 Qf3 2V6 3 Jkc4 Qf64 ?Jg5 dS 5 exd5 fta5 6 Nb5+ c6 7 dxc6 bxc6. Or what eventually became the main line of the Ruy Lopez, Chigorin's Defence with 1 e4 e5 2 ftf3 5k6 3 Jkb5 a64 Aa4Qf65 O-O b5
6 Nb3 Ne7 7 Hel O-O 8 c3 d6 9 h3 fta5 10
Jtc2 c5, etc. In the King's Gambit, we see the line 1 e4e5 2f4exf43 Qrf3 ftf64e5 h5 and a great number of other positions arising after the moves ..exf4, ."g5-g4, and now ."Qh5. The Evans Gambit includes various examples, e.g., I e4e5 2?}f3 Nc6 3 Jkc4 Ac5 4 b4 Axb45 c3, and now 5...1ke7 6 <14 <2X15, or 5... .c5 60-0d6
7 d4 exd4 8 cxd4 Nb6 9 d5 Qa5 10 Bb2f6 11
Jtd3 (and several other Evans positions). White too plays a variety of such moves in standard e-pawn openings; eg., 1 e4 e5 2 ftf3 ?k6 3 Bb5 a6 and now 4 Jkxc6 dxc6 5 O-O iJdfi 6 Sa3 or 4 Jka4 5 (XO b5 6 Jkb3 Bc5 7 a4 IIb8 8 c3 d6 9 d4 Nb6 10 fta3. On the other side of the board, the move Qh4 is a good one in the early middlegame of a great number of double e-pawn openings. The move appears in the context of playing for 4)f5, but often with the simultaneous goal of f4. Likewise with Black's use of .2 h5. Indeed it could be argued that given the early predominance of 1 e4 e5 openings, warnings about knights on the rim stemmed more from a philosophical belief than what would have been best in actual practice. One possible influence was that such knight moves seemed almost forbidden in most 1 d4 d5 positions that they played at the time. More importantly, masters knew that knights on the edge were a definite disadvantage in endings. As noted elsewhere, this sort of generalization from endings to the middlegame has been a problem throughout the historical development of theory. In addition to the above influences, a very powerful factor was probably the too- inflexible belief in centralization that held sway for so many years. As a whole, then, abstract considerations appear to have become more powerful than the reality. Today, while 1 e4 e5 has greatly declined in relative popularity, standard structures of all types lend themselves to support of knights on the edge of the board, and an impressive num- ber of previously frowned-upon knight sallies iave become respectable- This to some extent flics in the face of the principle of centraliza- tion, so dear to writers through the years. That principle deserves respect, of course, but not rigid adherence, and today's masters don't seem to fret over any hypothetical break with princi- ple when breaching it. Even if a knight is well- placed towards the centre of the board 90% of the time in a particular pawn-structure, players are open to situations in which the best way to defend or make progress is to re-deploy to the periphery. Statistics are not terribly meaningful with so many qualitative variables, but perhaps they have some Limited value. We can look at all the cases in which white knights remained on h3, h4, a3, or a4 for 6 or more full moves (i,e., they were left there for more than temporary pur- poses), and then include the analogous posi- tions for Black (knights on h6, h5, a6, a5)< Going only up to move 30 (to minimize anoma- lies and endings), we find that the 20 top play- ers from 1985-2002 moved to and kepi their knights on the border in 1 7% of their games. In the period from 1901-1935, they did so in
11.5% of their games. But as suggested above,
this latter figure goes down to well below 10% when one looks at positions arising from open- ings other than 1 c4 c5 Such numbers arc natu- rally of limited significance, particularly since they ignore the range of positions in which these knight moves occurred; that has greatly ex- panded in modem times. But even ignoring qualitative issues these figures reflect a grow- ing contemporary trend. Knight Decentralization in Contemporary Play Examples of knights effectively placed on the rim are strewn throughout the book before you (in the chapter on development, for example) and I have often pointed them out explicitly. With that in mind. I'll present a number of fur- ther examples, mostly but not all in specialized situations. That knight moves to the perimeter tend to be somewhat reactive in character is shown by the fact that the ones most familiar to us are played by Black. Using the same criteria as above for the 1985-2002 era, we find that
158 CHESS STRATEGY IN ACTION
about 65% of such edge placements are by Black. The reasons are not difficult to see. White more often establishes a specific pawn- structure with more space than Black does, and it is natural for Black to avoid the tempo-gaining advance of a large centre by developing to the side. In addition, one finds that with less space it is easier to run into the problem of one's pieces getting in each other's way. By develop- ing knights to the edge of the board, one leaves paths free for the bishops' development. And finally, such knights won't block freeing pawn advances. Thus we often see the move ...41a6 associated with breaking down a broad white centre, as in many variations of the King's In dian, Griinfeld, Pirc, Dutch, Slav, and others. In the Sicilian Defence we saw the decentralizing ...Qa5 in the Chapter 2 section on doubled pawns, the point being to drive back White's pieces by ...Qc4 and/or to clear the way for free- ing moves like ...e5 and ...d5. The move ...R5h5 can also be a reaction to the opponent's space advantage. In the same chapter we saw some nice examples of .. and allowing White to capture on h5 with either the bishop or knight, creating doubled pawns. This both increased Black's piece activity and allowed for ...f5 to attack White's centre. Probably the most ex- treme case of this, played while Black is com- pletely undeveloped, short of space, and with no pressure whatsoever against White's centre, was seen in the variation 1 d4 £}f6 2 c4 g6 3 ?5c3 ilg74e4 d6 5 13 0X)6 gc2c5 7 d5 e6 8 2Bg3 exd5 9 cxd5 4Bh5!? 10 ftxh5 gxh5, Refer to that section for details. There follows a tiny subset of the many other modem occurrences of knights on the rim. In my bock on the Benoni, for example, I analysed a line similar to those above, although this time the knight is happy to stay on the edge for a while: Zaichik - Romanishin Tbilisi 1988 1 d4Qf62c4c5 3d5e64 Slc3exd5 5cxd5d6 6 m g6 7 e4 Ng7 8 h30-0 9 ld3 2Bh5!? (DJ lliis move is more or less absurd by classical standards, not only drawing a knight away from the central action, but doing so before Black's pieces are developed. But from its post on h5 the knight: a) performs the simple prophylactic func- tion of preventing Jtf4, b) opens up the path of Black's g7-bishop, c) allows for ...f5, and d) provides a handy path for the queen, w hich can actually go to h4 with effect if White's f3- knight strays to the quecnside as it normally would like to do. One might want to take special note of func- tion 'b*. It is characteristic of many positions in chess that bishops, however strong in principle, exert little influence due to a knight that blocks them. The interesting question then arises of where that knight might move to avoid that problem. Instead of crowding the centre with more pieces or perhaps blocking another piece such as a rook, players arc increasingly putting knights on the rim even if it means temporarily diminishing their influence, Such knights can either remain there to restrict enemy pieces or they can return to the centre after the disposi- tion of its comrades becomes clarified. This pattern doesn' t appear in all games with knights on the rim, of course, but it is worth keeping in mind when looking at examples throughout the book,

the bishop- pair is getting extremely annoying. Naturally this is just one game, and putting a knight at h5 has its disadvantages as well as ad- vantages. From the notes, however, one can see both the logic and pragmatic value such a move can have. It might be fun to revive a discussion begun in SOMCS about a variation that pits White's space advantage against Black's piece pressure, and particularly a border patrol knight on a5.

Rc2 Sb8 11 b3 b5 12 Nb2 (D) This is an old and established main line position; I quoted two examples played from it in SOMCS. The whole variation is a superb il- lustration of the usefulness of an offside knight, in this case one that is apparently stranded on a5. In fact, the knight has to justify itself there because no acceptable retreat exists, b7 being a truly awful square. Now the lines 12..x6, 12-..e5, 12."Bh6 (to exert pressure against c4), and 12.. bxc4 13 bxc4 _h6 have been played and analysed for years. Janjgava's 2003 book King's Indian <£ Griinfeld: Fianchetto Lines covers those moves in great depth, and briefly discusses !2,..Ee8, 12,.Jkd7, and 12...Jlf5 as well. Hut there's no mention at all of the next move:
12U15!?
What's this? Black's game has been based upon queenside action, and now he pushes a flank pawn on the other side of the board? What's more, in contrast to 12.-.e6 or 12,..e5, the move doesn't even establish a presence in the centre. At first this seems incomprehensi- ble, but there is logic to it based upon our ec- centric hero on a5. Since White's pieces are concerned with defending the queensidc, they are at least partially immobilized by that knight. Black can therefore take the time to attack by, e.g,, ".h4 and in many cases ...e5, ...Qh5 and The f6-knight can also go to g4 with in- creased effect in certain lines. It's extraordinary that after so many games from the position after 12 iLb2 (over 1600 in my largest database), chess-players can find an entirely new and per- fectly legitimate middlegame strategy. Perhaps less surprising is the fact that 12".h5 is a flank pawn attack, one of the characteristic marks of contemporary chess. In response to Black's advance on the other wing, White logically takes the opportunity to neutralize Black's standard exchange sacrifice

In case I am giving the impression that knight moves to the flank were forbidden in older times, I should make clear that it's a matter of the number and variety of positions in which such moves have become thinkable, even ones that looked absurd 30 years ago, much less 70 or 80. This is emphatically not the case with the l...e5 examples above, nor, for example, with the flank move ffih3 as used in the Dutch De- fence. Those familiar with the opening will note that that in recent years <?Bh3 has been a re- liable counter to both the Dutch Stonewall and to certain Ixningrad Dutch Variations. In fact, my database of top players from 1985 to 2002 reveals the score with $5h3 versus the Dutch Defence as 61%-39%, with White performing at 120+ Elo points above rating expectations. But it's also true that many of the classical greats recognized the move's value; e.g., Rub instein, Fine, Alekhine, Capablanca, Pillsbury, Spielmann, Samisch and several others! They didn't do quite as well playing 4Bh3, but this probably has to do with the spread of knowl- edge about how to handle the relevant posi- tions and later refinement of both sides' precise move-orders. Nevertheless, looking at the fol- lowing games, is there any serious difference in the basics of White's middlegame strategy? a) Capablanca-Botvinnik, Hastings 1934/5: ld4e62c4f53g3Qf64iLg2M7 5Qc3d56 4Bh3 c6 7 SW O-O 8 O-O Qa6 9 QJf4 *h8? 10 Nd3 4k7 1 1 Bf4 Qce8 12 c5!

The two knights on the flank are a pleasing complement to Black's two fianchettoed bishops and symmetrically-placed rooks. This is a good example of the function mentioned in the very first game above, that knights move to the rim in order to unmask bishops and at the same not to crowd the centre or back rank. As ex- plained there, such knights can either remain on the edge of the board to restrict enemy pieces or they can return to the centre after the disposi- tion of the other pieces becomes clarified.
AN EDGY DAY AND SLEEPLESS KNIGHT 163
even they would have considered many of to- day's other routine decentralizations as exotic and unsound. Sleepless Knights The rest of this section will be devoted to the topic of "sleepless knights'. As explained above, these are knights that can1! seem to find rest at any particular spot and seemingly uncon- cernedly rush from place to place at great cost of time, thus flouting the rules of develop- ment. For a good example of what I mean, we might hark back to the games with the French Advance Variation given at the end of Chapter i - There, despite the potentially semi-open na- ture of the line indicated by either White's dxc5 and/or c4 and Black's ...f6, Black ig- nored his development. In the one case, he took time out to play ...41ge7-g6-h8-f7, arriv- ing just in time to avoid being overrun; and in the other case he found the effective strategy of ...4&ge7 g6-f8-h7-g5! It is no wonder that these plans weren't discovered until recently, because they require an ultra-specific attitude that pays attention to the minute particulars of the position rather than a preconceived notion of how White's pawn-chain must be attacked. When in the second case the knight had made its fifth move, Black hadn't even castled yet, and more significantly, he had abstained from both the traditional attack on the base of the pawn-chain at d4 and the modem one on the head of the pawn-chain on e5. We can find examples of modem knight wanderings in the oldest of openings: Xu Yuanyuan - Karaklajid Beijing 1997 I d4 dS 2 c4 eb 3 Qc3 c6 4 4tf3 Nf6 5 cxdS exd5 6 Qc2 7 a3 Q c7 8 Ng5 Seti 9 Nh4 g<5 To fianchetto the bishop? 10e3Ng7 No, the knight!

is in Dvoretsky's impressively original insight that we saw in SOMCS: the superfluous knight. It's hard to imagine a better example. White continually acts as though he wants to occupy c5 twice! In situations with multiple claimants to the same outpost (notice that a rook or queen could go there as well), it's often best to leave the piece occupying that square to its own de- vices. Otherwise the back-up piece (here the b3-koight) is reduced to standing by and be- comes 'superfluous'. So if possible the oppo- nent should not, by exchanging the forward piece, bail out the rear one(s) and make them more relevant 29__h4 30 ihl Rf6!? Baburin believes that this is mistimed and al- lows White to break out, but that doesn't seem correct. Unfortunately, Black doesn't get the tactics right.

White would now seem to have ample time to take over d5 and get all his pieces out, when he is ready to play e4, and claim a big advan- tage. But appearances are deceptive. Black has only one idea: c5 is the ideal blockading square and Black is headed there! With his lack of developing moves! he is chal- lenging White: "OK, what can you do to me?'.

At this point White sacrificed a piece unsoundly by 30 , so the rest of the game is not of interest. Let4s wrap up with some firn. Fischer's knight tour in the next game is in a tactical context and thus not as relevant as the other examples, Still, it's interesting that in a variation known for the importance of each tempo Black can casually enjoy the scenery, as shown in the imbedded game even more dramatically.

In this section, we first examined a number of new and creative situations in which knights reside happily and usefully on the edge of the board. The number of such situations is clearly on the increase, especially in games involving strong players, and it is obvious that worries about the knight's shorter range have been tran- scended by today's ever more pragmatic philos- ophy. Put simply: if moving a knight to the side of the board helps to win the game, put it there. Such knights often tic down the opponent's pieces to defence of a particular point and thus prove themselves of equal worth to the defend- ing enemy pieces. In some structures, knights on the rim also unmask bishops and allow coor- dination of the rooks and queen. In the rest of the section, we had some fun with examples of sleepless knights, i.e., those that can't seem to find rest anywhere and un- dertake exotic manoeuvres at apparent expense of time and development. The reader can guess that such wandering knights are to be found throughout the range of chess practice. They exemplify the sometimes paradoxical relation- ship between time and efficiency that keeps the mystery in our game. OK, it's just a blitz game and White has to- tally misplaced his pieces for a queenside at- tack. Nevertheless, his kingside is moderately well defended and Black faces a question of how to proceed. Just about anyone would think about attacking moves in the direction of the white king; e g., 24.. Bh5 (not a bad move, in- tending 25 JXfl 4)g3) or perhaps ."4Bh4. In- stead, Fischer plays: 24"ah8!I This must be one of the greatest moves ever made in a high-level blitz tournament ! The point is (fairly) obvious once you see it, but who would think of it?

3.2 The Behaviour of Bishops
Much of what I will say in this section was dis- cussed in limited form in SOMCS; hopefully 1 can clarify it here and present appropriate ex- amples. The first thing that one needs to know about the bishop is that in a majority of cases a bishop is superior to a knight, and a bishop-pair is better than a knight-pair with or without the presence of most other combinations of other pieces or pawns. The bishop- pair is very often full compensation for a pawn, and a bishop and pawn will frequently match up well against a rook. The reader may wish to refer to SOMCS for some related statistics. This view of the bishop conforms with con- temporary prejudices, and I suspect that one would be hard-pressed to find a top-50 grand- master who would contest the general conclu- sion that bishops are better on the average. Kasparov, who once laughingly agreed with the statement that any bishop however bad is better than a knight, points out that Fischer believed the bishop to be so clearly better than the knight that he suggested 3'A for a bishop's value. The bishop's superiority has of course been the ma- jority belief among master players ever since the time of Botvinnik and (less definitely) be- fore. But never as unanimously and unambigu- ously as among the younger players of the last two decades. Kasparov thinks, for example, that Petrosian found it difficult to accept the superiority of the bishop, something that his games often seem to reflect. He also notes that Smyslov was rather too willing to give up his bishops, citing four games from their Candi- dates match in which Smyslov ceded Kasparov the bishop-pair. Euwe and Kramer go further back in time when they say that "Formerly the knight was usually given preference, but nowa- days it is the bishop. However, it is still not possible to assert that a bishop is in general stronger than a knight, or vice versa ... A cen- tury ago most players, in the romantic tradition, gave preference to the knight over the bishop. Today the opposite is more often the case, at least in certain types of common positions. How far this is due to subjective factors is diffi- cult to decide. It is certain that in general two bishops are strong than two knights or than a knight and bishop, although there are some cases in which the knights will dominate." Bishops Good and Bad Of course a genera] statistical superiority has nothing to do with individual cases, the latter giving rise to different assessments of the re spective minor pieces in countless actual posi tions with all types of characteristics. One of the elementary questions we may have about a bishop is whether it is well or poorly placed, and in particular whether it is 'good' or 'bad'. In SOMCS, the latter distinction was shown to be deceptive in many cases. A bishop hemmed in by its central pawns can serve many valuable functions. For one thing, it will often serve the defence better than a good bishop would, as is reflected in Suba's idea that 'bad bishops can defend good pawns'. An obvious and important example comes about in most Sicilian De- fences, which have central pawns (normally a 2-1 majority) ond6 and e5 (e.g., Najdorf, Svesh- nitov, etc.) or on d6 and e6 (Najdorf, Scheven- ingen, Paulsen, Taimanov, etc.); in both cases, a bishop on e7 is an excellent piece. In fact Black often transforms the latter structure into the for- mer one, making the bishop 'worse' and the d- pawn backward (jee/o/towing Jzagram). This idea also crops up in many other open- ings, of course. I might add that bad bishops can not only protect good pawns but also good squares. SOMCS gave numerous disadvanta- geous examples of the exchange of one's bad bishop for a good one by moving a knight's pawn and then playing ...Aa6 or ... j&.h6 (alternatively, _fi.a3 or Bh3, although White seems generally less interested in this particular type of ex- change). This is a notoriously risky manoeuvre
THE BEHAVIOUR OF BISHOPS 171
13 a4 Efe8 14 Rd3 was the above-mentioned
Botvinnik game, which in strategic terms went very similarly to the one before us. But this ex- act move-order is now considered inaccurate because of Botvinnik's suggestion 14...Rb7!, which discourages e4 and keeps the knight on a6 so that it protects c5 and doesn't get in the way of a potential rook on c8 by moving to c7. U."Be8 12 g3Wd7 A rare and subtle move, eyeing the light squares and in particular a4.

e5 Q>d7 17 Bd2 Qa5 18 Eddl 4Bc4 19 f4 21xa3
20 f5 with a serious attack.
Yet another idea is Zviagintsev's sugges- tion 13 Af5, advantageously preserving the two bishops. This is only possible due to the move 12...Ud7 and shows how move-specific the respective strategies can be. because, as shown there, the squares of the col- our left behind (e.g., f6/h6/g7 or c6/a6/b7) tend to be weak. Notice that grandmasters are wary of playing Jta6 in a Queen's Gambit struc- ture. Both ...Na6 and "Bh6 are particularly bad if they go there in two moves (e.g., ...Bb7 and ...jta6) and/or are captured with tempo on that square (c.g., by an fl -bishop capturing on a6 instead of first going to d3 and then capturing). The main exception is when the recapturing knight gain access to a very useful square for that particular situation, such as c5 or f5. Thus as always one cannot generalize very well; each case has to be studied and calculated thoroughly. Here's one of those ...J&_a6 games in a varia- tion made famous by Botvinnik-Capablanca, Rotterdam AVRO 1938. In this particular case White is in no position to exploit Black's queen- side squares, but the prophylactic influence that a light-squared bishop has versus White's c4 break disappears. A great struggle ensues (both White and Black have ratings around 2650), with the most remarkable feature being the rel- ative strengths and weaknesses of White's bad bishop.

Even though Black has achieved his ideal goal of exchanging off White's light-squared bishop in minimal time (..J@La6 came in one jump and White had moved his bishop already before it was exchanged, so Black is two tempi up on the worst case), such positions are still difficult to handle in view of White's straight- forward idea of e4e5.

The very bad bishop protects the very good pawn on d4 so as to be able to play e4. It's inter- esting that my computer engine likes Black here in view of White's miserable-appearing bishop, slow development and Black's play down the c-fi!e, including total control over the outpost on c4. Even the a4~pawn is weak. But this is where the modem faith in bishops ap- pears. Black can dance around with his knights, but unless he can find a central break to disturb the equilibrium or find some squares on the king's wing, the side with the bishop can build up slowly until it becomes a superior piece.

Black almost always feels compelled to play this move, even though it releases pressure on the centre. To sec why, look at a line hke

Zviagintsev didn't like 26 owing to 26,..41h5!. The text-move counts upon Black's damaged pawn-structure and White's control of the dark squares to compensate for the loss of the exchange. As noted elsewhere, the types of position tn which a minor piece is considered long-term compensation for a rook have ex- panded dramatically with each passing decade. Here the paucity of remaining material doesn't discourage White from this decision. 26 gxf6 27ftDf5! Zviagintsev gives 27."ftxb2 28 Qg4 Se6 29 Rxh2 "with an attack".

White doesn't even have a pawn for the exchange, but Zviagintsev clearly just assumes that the (still bad) bishop is worth a rook. I have mentioned before how high-level annotators these days forget to men- tion that one player or the other is an exchange down, or even to refer to the precise material

SOMCS has two stark examples of this difficulty. For one thing, White can often break with f4, since the prophylactic influence of the bishop on g7 is gone. Here's another ex- ample: Onishchuk - Lupu Bastia 2000 A basic King's Indian position has arisen. Black now manoeuvres to exchange his king's bishop. 12_*h8 13 a3 g8 14 "c2 ±h6 15 43dl a6 16 b4 Bxe3 17 €lxe3 (DJ But with what result? Black has the 'better' bishop, to be sure (although it has nowhere to go). Yet he is cramped and the one break that is the redeeming feature of KID positions, ...f5. in this case only exposes his dark squares further after, say, exfS and 14. The missing bishop on g7 would have at least strongly discouraged White from opening up the kingside in that manner. Its function in such a normal King's In- dian, as explained in SOMCS, can be seen as indirect prophylaxis. TTffi BEHAVIOUR OF BISHOPS 175 17".Rg5 For example, 17,"$Bh6 18 Sabi f5 19 exf5 gxfS 20 f4, and the move -e4 would only ex- pose Black to a timely g4.

On the positive side, Black challenges the two bishops and tries to remedy the space dis- advantage that he labours under. But again, the prophylactic role of a bishop on g7 will be missed. 11 c5! Furthermore, protection of the e5-pawn has been weakened. Here 1 L.,dxe5? 12 2! threatens both exfS followed by Rxe5 and in some cases Qb5+; e.g., 12..JaLxcl (12...Rd6 13 exf5 with the point 13".gxf5? 14 Nb5!) 13Efxcl f4 141fb5+*f7

Then White has a large and probably winning advantage, because Black's pieces are stuck and he has weak pawns as well.

Here's an older example of the same issue in the Stonewall Dutch Defence, brilliantly re- solved by one of the old masters: Flohr - Goldberg 1755/? CA (Moscow) 1949 1 d4e62 41f3 f53 g3£tt64 Bg2 d5 5 O-O £d" 6 c4c6 This opening is a fertile ground for good- versus-bad bishop debates. At first sight one Black's pawns on d6 and e5 (but not c7), this might occur by ...Ac7-d8-b6 (or -aS) and with pawns on e6 and d5 (but not f7), we often see ...Ad7-e8 -g6 (or -h5). Here's a simple example of the latter: Shirov - Morozevich Frankfort rpd 2000

&fd7 6 -SiLxe7 tfxe7 7 f4 a6 8 $M3 c5 9 Rd2 Nc6 16 O-O-O c4"? A very unusual plan for the French Defence as it releases the pressure on d4. It is also sin- gle-minded: Black plays for ...b5-b4 and an at- tack on the king. Notice that Black already had the bad bishop, but now it won't be getting out on the queensidc. On the other hand. White is denied the ideal d3-square and (as in the Stone- wall Dutch Defence in the next game) he must prove that his 'good' bishop isn't just biting on granite.

This looks like an innocent and almost auto- matic idea: White isolates Black's h-pawn on an open file, since 15...g6 would be a bit too much even for our featured light-squared bishop! But
THE BEHAVIOUR OF BISHOPS 177
could hardly have a better example of a bad bishop for Black versus a good one (White's centre is defined by the dark-squared d-pawn). Let's consider Kramnik's query about the rela- tive strengths of these bishops: is White's light- squared bishop so much better than Black's? And if not, why not? a) White's 'good' bishop on g2 is restricted by the d5-pawn; it is not particularly effective in such a position, b) Black's bishop is the 'bad bishop protect- ing a good pawn [or two]\ How can the latter idea be relevant, since White is threatening neither b7 nor c6 (nor e6)? Because the standard white attack by c5, b4, a4 and b5 is more effective without that defensive bishop. Or consider an attack by f3 and e4, which can lead to a target on e6. That square that is defended if Black has his bad bishop, whereas the f3 + e4 attack almost always comes at the cost of counter play, c.g,, by ...c5 or e5 Thus the whole idea arises infrequently in this opening. Finally, an obvious point: the 'freeing move' ...e5 actually frees something, i.e., the bishop! This is especially true after the very common ...f4 attack for Black. Alternately, the c8-bishop sometimes gets out by ...Jkd7-e8-h5, or ...b6 and .. Jtb7, when after ...c5 the bishop can gain activity and/or protect crucial light squares. Finally, there is the set-up with ".c5 and ...Jtd7, a modest but handy square; the bishop's place- ment is then non-idea], but keeps an eye on the vulnerable e6 while monitoring queenside squares and clearing the back rank. For all that I would prefer the bishop on g2, however unenthusiastically, to the one on c8. But one should not expect too much from that imbalance, nor be surprised if it turns against one.

An extraordinary decision! The e5-knight is a monster, and can even gain support from Qd2-f3. Why on earth would Flohr give it up for a bishop? The first part of the answer is that after 11 ftd2 Jle8, as mentioned above, Black might bring the bishop to the useful square h5. Another point has to do with Dvoretsky's 'su- perfluous knight' concept: after ?Bd2-f3, one could argue that two knights aren't really needed to cover one square (e5). That may or may not be true if White then reorganizes with £kl3 f4, but the whole issue is certainly not clear, espe- cially if Black gets ...g5 in, Aside from the above, there's a third poten- tial reason for eliminating Black's light-squared bishop, already noted above. Although it doesn't come up in this game, White will often execute a central break by f3 and e4. In that case Black's bad bishop defends critical squares such as e6, d5 and f5.

Ljubojevic - Beliavsky Tilburg 1984 The French Winawer variation has all sorts of astonishing and paradoxical cases of good and bad bishops for both colours, often making lengthy trips to assert themselves as attackers or defenders. Even some standard variations contain positions that at first sight seem ab- surdly bad for Black based upon his light squared bishop's immobility. Yet these lines are played continually with perfectly good results for Black.

It certainly looks more logical to keep the pawns off light squares and avoid the serious holes on f6 and h6 that 13...g6 creates. But paradoxically, 13...g6 has quite a few ad- vantages over 13..216. These are the sorts of things that must be seen to be understood. As in the Stonewall Dutch, the combination of ...g6 and ".c4 can leave White's bishop 'biting on granite'. In the long run it should still prove superior to Black's, but there are hidden factors in the details. Stefan Kindeimann and Ulrich Dirr's remarkable book FranzdsucA Winawer shows how a wide variety of positions are play- able in which this bishop is semi-permanently imprisoned. That contradicts the opinion of all theoreticians (and most if not all players) up until the last two decades or so.

But one thing that we are learning is that defence of a key pawn will often fully justify a bishop's existence, and in similar games White has seldom been able to make progress in such positions.

As I have said elsewhere, some common sayings are pretty useful, and the old saw that 'opposite-coloured bishops tend to favour the attacker' is both handy and true, especially with a few pieces off the board and some sort of real- istic targets against which to direct the bishop's power. Although it's not usually expressed, it's also true that there is more likely to be a situa- tion with mutual attacking chances when there are opposite-coloured bishops on the board. As usual, one must develop an instinct for which cases this might apply to and which not; that is normally gained by dint of experience. Never- theless, this guideline is more useful than most since, crucially, it doesn't restrict one's thought. That one might look for some attacking chances when one has such a bishop is at worst harm- less; no one is going to insist on attacking in a position with no such prospects just because there are opposite-coloured bishops. For the sake of comparison, I would remind you of the kind of rule based thought that can and often does limit the imagination. One very well might (and many players do) dismiss worthwhile pos- sibilities by adhering too closely to the notions of quick development in the opening, or of not moving knights to the rim, or of avoiding bad bishops entirely. That mode of thinking can lead to very good moves being missed and later explanations like *1 thought that I had to de- velop some pieces so that didn't even occur to me', 'Well I didn't consider that continuation because the knight looked funny out there' or 'I couldn't play with a bad bishop'. can sometimes throw caution to the winds just to open lines: Zviagintsev - J.

Dvoretsky's recent book Schcjf/l vf Excellence 3: Strategic Play contains many instructional gems* They generally aren't of the traditional hit-you-over-the-head sort, to be mindlessly absorbed, but require thoughtfulness and con- centration upon the part of the reader. The fol- lowing game says a great deal about modem bishop play and the application of general ideas thereto.

Already the game is developing into a strug- gle featuring the good and bad bishops and their interpretation. The move 11...b5 is typical of the pragmatic but optically distasteful mod- em treatment (see Black's a6-bishop and the glaring hole on an open file on c5). With it, Black transforms a position with a standard white edge into something complex and multi- faceted. 13".Qxe5 14 fxe5 Nd7 15 Bf2 b4 16 axb4 Nc4 17 Ua4 Jkxb4 18 QxdS! cxdS 19 Rxd7 Nxe2 20 flfcl HfdB 21 Sc7 Wtf 22 Qc2 Bb5 23 iel (D) Dvoretsky uses this position (and the rest of the game) to make some points about chess thinking and in particular the role of the bishops. Here he challenges the reader with the question "Should Black exchange bishops?" His answer is that "from a formal viewpoint. White's dark- squared bishop is 'bad1 (his central pawns are on squares of the same colour as the bishop), whereas Black's is 'good* ... But in chess, for- mal logic is far from always valid. By standing at c 3, the bishop securely defends the vulnera- ble pawns at b2 and d4, after which White can calmly strengthen his position - the opponent has no counteiplay. (As grandmaster Mihai Suba pointed out, a bad bishop sometimes de- fends good pawns)/' 23-Jkf8? For the reasons given in the last note, Dvor- etsky says that it was 'essential' for Black to pursue the initiative by 23...Jkxel! 24 JXxel HacS 25 Rd2 Bh6 26 b3 (26 flacl?! Sc4! 27 Exc4 dxc4) 26... Jkd7!, heading for c6 with a solid defence (27 Jlxd5? Ab5). To be fair, I should admit that this suggestion is a good ex- ample of the virtues of exchanging when one has less space. In the section on exchanging in Chapter 1, 1 criticized Dvoretsky for his lack of such examples.
24 Nc3 a6 25 Rd2 Nc4 26 Na5?I
Here Dvoretsky suggests 26 Jkfl with 'the unusual idea of exchanging [White's] g2-bishop for the opponent's 'bad' light-squared bishop11. The idea is to get rid of the piece that is protect- ing aU of Black's weak points. This voluntary ceding of White's optically attractive bishop is all the more surprising because it also contra- dicts the previously-mentioned advice not to exchange when you control more space. Never- theless the move looks quite good. Dvoretsky
184 CHESS STRATEGY IN ACTION
provides the following abbreviated analysis: 26 Afl!? (D). At this point Dvoretsky meekly tries to de- fend the conventional wisdom by stating, "the negation of some obvious rule docs not signify that the position is not subject to the laws of chess - it is simply that other, latent principles and rules are operating?' In this case, the other 'latent principles and rules1 include 'the initia- tive1 and 'the possibility of being the first to mount an attack on the opponent's pawns'. I could launch into another speech here about how such an interpretation fails on the grounds of efficient explanation and is at best irrelevant due to linguistic confusion. Just ask yourself how a player would use those and a few hun- dred other such 'principles and rules1 (??) to make assessments ("the possibility of being the first..' is a 'principle'?). But I have amply cov- ered that ground elsewhere and won't bore the reader again. Abstractions apart, White's bad bishop that protected his good pawns is now gone while Black's remains, so time is now of the essence for White to neutralize the play against his b- and d-pawns. 29Qd2Bb3?I Dvoretsky doesn't like exchanging rooks and suggests 29".Eb5! to triple by ...Rb6 and -Hcb8. Then his earlier imaginative idea of 30 Af 1! still looks right, holding some sort of bal- ance after 3O...Ecb8 31 Axc4 dxc4; e.g., 32 Hc2 Sb3 33 Re2?!

How many average players, regardless of their experience, would be so free of textbook influence to consider playing this way and then to follow through? Such paradoxical exchanges are incidentally very typical of how Black can get in trouble in the French Defence, Furthermore, the analo- gous King's Indian positions with White's bad bishop on B and pawns on g2, e4, and d5 ver- sus Black's good bishop on d7 or b7 with pawns on d6 and e5 are often difficult or lost for Black, who has trouble defending his good pawns,
26..-Sdc8 27 AM?
Ironically, Black's good bishop was worth less than White's bad one, the former having nothing useful to do or protect. As Dvoretsky has already pointed out, it is the protective function of White's dark- squared bishop that is so valuable. Incidentally, one should note that almost none of what we're saying about these bishops would apply in the endgame. As I have often said, tra- ditional rules tend to apply much better in the endgame than in the opening or middlegame. Indeed much of the misunderstanding and dog- matism of the textbooks arises from the fact that such 'principles' are derived from endgame positions and then incorrectly generalized to other situations,

Dvoretsky consistently finds these sorts of subtle and intricate real-world battles that make his books stand out above the usual fare. Restless Bishops The knights aren't the only pieces that are in- creasingly to be found wandering around from one position to another at cost of time. It's im- possible to do justice to the number of new bishop moves that seem to defy the rules of de- velopment. In any number of positions from modem practice, for example, fianchettoed bish- ops are returned to their original positions for a new task. Some simple examples are in double d-pawn and Indian openings in which Black first plays .. Jlb7 or even ... Ba6 and then -..J&_b7, yet after the exchange cxd5 and ...exd5 he re- routes that bishop to c8 and then, say, e6 (see the Tartakower Variation examples in Chapter I). There arc many King's Indian Defence vari- ations in which after ."c5 and d5, Black will play ..Xe8 and ... jfiLfK This is usually to defend against c5 and protect the d-pawn, but some- times also to play ...?}h5, ,"Jte7, and ...f5! We also sec White play ilg2-f 1 in a num- ber of queen's pawn openings for the sake of protecting c4 and preventing ".b5. But what about the reverse process? Are there times when a player develops a bishop to a logical square and then re routes it to a fianchettoed position? Here is a surprising example: Schflssler - Miles Reykjavik 1986
1 d4 Q f6 2 c4 e6 3 4tf3 b6 4 4k3 A b4 5 Jkg5
Nb7<5 e3 h67 Nh4 g5 8 Ng3 4W So far so normal for a Nimzo-Indian De- fence. Black will often aim to double two sets Dvoretsky assigns this a *?', but that doesn't seem to correspond to his assessment of what happens next. He suggests that Black should keep the rooks on by 33...Zb4 (' !') 34 Hf3 Qb6
35 Ef2, which is OK for White, since Qf4 will
divert Black from the queenside. Interestingly, he bemoans the fact that the bishop isn't on e6 protecting both dS and f7. The irony there is that Suba's bad-bishops-proteet good-pawns maxim would then have reached its ultimate application, since normally bishops in front of the weaknesses they protect (here, on c4) are considered better than ones passively placed behind them. 34Hxb3"?xb3 Dvoretsky explains that the game is now level because Black's active queen cannot be driven back. Otherwise, White's bishop would give him the advantage, because it really is somewhat better than its rival now. He says "at last it is possible, without mistake, to apply the standard evaluation to the strength of the bish- ops." Unfortunately he doesn't seem to take note that we are now well and truly in an end game, a stage at which that evaluation so nor- mally applies that we might even dare to call it a ... rule? In this context, Euwe says: "In order to appraise the value of a bad bishop in any given position, it is important to consider how much material remains on the board. The weakness of the bad bishop is highlighted as the endgame approaches. And this brings us to the important conclusion that while the bad bishop can be quite strong in cooperation with other pieces, its strength wanes as opportunities for cooper- ation diminish with exchanges or unsuitable [placements] of other pieces." 35*f2 aS 36 h4

But there is one other consideration: 15" f8! 16Wd2A£7(D) By this original manoeuvre, the bishop puts direct pressure on White's only weakness: his d-pawn.

The subjects of good-versus-bad bishops, opposite-coloured bishops, and wandering/re- trcating bishops could consume a whole book, so I'll stop here. In this limited section wc have seen that assessing the quality of a bishop and its role in development by employing abstract considerations is practically impossible. The role of bad bishops protecting good pawns has received some further attention, and it will be referred to elsewhere in this book. 17SdlSc8 18a3Ne7I?

3.3 The Minor Pieces Square Off
SOMCS went into so much detail about the pit- ting of minor pieces against each other that I will limit this section to some examples about situations that didn't receive much coverage there and a few more that struck my fancy. But I haven't really stinted on this crucial subject be- cause there is vast amount of material on minor piece play throughout just about every part of this book, especially examples involving two knights versus two bishops in the section on doubled pawns. I have also tended to supply extra commentary to issues related to minor pieces. An idea that has got lost in the shuffle. Nor- mally in such positions Black plays for ...b5 with moves such as ".a6, .. _Zb8, and ...?k7. He hasn't enjoyed much success thereby. Spassky's move initiates central action. 12 dxrf?! Perhaps Geller doesn't see what's happening or reacts too quickly. He proceeds 'themati- cally* to open up the position for the bishops, but it turns out that the knights are given more freedom to find useful posts. A poor alternative is 12 Bc2?! JLic3! 13 bxc3 We? with a solid game. But 12 Hcl or 12 Rd2, both preventing the doubled pawns, retains a solid advantage. Then Black has no way to transform the central situation and secure posts for his knights. In many cases White can gradually increase his space advantage on both sides of the board after which the open lines will come of themselves. In general it will be very difficult to contest that expansion. We therefore see little of Black's set-up today. 12"dxe613±g4W 14 f4 This allows doubled pawns, but other moves aren't convincing given this new pawn-struc- ture; eg., 14 Rd2 4)e5 15 Be2 4k6I intending ."4)d4. 14,"lxc3 15 bxc3 4Bg7 Prophylaxis against f5. 16tfd2 b6! 17Wd3(P) Bishop and Knight Conflicts In this section, for fun, let's first look at some older (but still modem-era) examples.

This creative contest continues the SOMCS discussion of doubled pawns and minor pieces in the Nimzo- Indian, and contains a great number of themes relevant to our purpose. Some of the notes are based upon Tim Harding's excellent ones in his Here we have the classical approach to this position involving the direct blocking of White's e4-e5 idea. This strategy characterized early games around Nimzowitsch's time when the Nimzo-Indian began to catch on. I didn't say a great deal about it in SOMCS, since today so many strategies by Black in the Nimzo Indian involve opening the position quickly. Inciden- tally, for those of you who know this opening, Black seems to be a whole tempo up on the Hubncr Variation (4 e3 c5 5 Jkd3 Qc6 6 Qf3 J&_xc3+ 7 bxc3 d6), since there Black volun- tarily captures on c3 without the provocation by a3. The difference is that in our game White's knight has not been committed to the unfavourable square f3 and can keep open the options of kingside pawn advances from its position on e2. 9e4ahSI? This is a rare move first tried by Smyslov. The idea is obviously to limit the effectiveness of White's f4 break, but also in some cases to bring Black's queen into play via h4 or f6.

Not terrible, but I don't like the idea behind it at all.

Petrosian's own thoughts about this move. It wouldn't surprise me if he even anticipated it, based upon the concrete features of the posi- tion. For example, most annotators don't seem concerned that Black is threatening to improve his awful position considerably by ... .b5, per- haps followed by ...a5. These are important freeing ideas, the consideration of which would lead White at least to make 22 4&xd7+ a candi- date move. Examining the alternatives, for ex- ample, White might not like the looks of 22 *f2 ±b5 23 Nc2? (23 Eael Nxd3 24 Nxd3 Ec7 and Black has at least a lot more hope than in the original position) 23...a5, etc. So a natu- ral move is 22 a4, which stops ...Bb5 and also makes a good start towards generating a passed pawn on the queenside. Apart from 22 Qxd7+ this looks best to me; presumably Black would try 22,.J&.c6 (intending ...$3d7) 23 Eael (23 *f2 24 5\xd7+ Exd7 25 b5 axb5 26 Be 1 Bd6 27 axb5 Jld7 is again nice for White yet Black is still defending) 23...<5 17 24 Qxd7+ 3kxd7 25 b51?

All this is doubtless a case of *long analysis, wrong analysis', but it serves to indicate the lack of clarity such con- tinuations entail in the real world of concrete decision-making.

These kinds of lines, and especially the idea of ...Bb5f probably influenced Fischer's deci- sion, which is a quintessentially practical one leaving fewer complications and very little need for calculation. Why give such messy po- sitions to Petrosian, a master of both defence and the endgame? This is especially true since it only takes one more move (22 Qxd7+ Sxd7

vantage indeed. Zl Jlxd? 23 Ecl (D) worthwhile one because it questions the monu- mental status of Fischer's key minor-piece de- cision and puts it in a modem context. Fischer - Petrosian Buenos Aires Ct (7) 1971

His decision is open-minded and might even seem daring in the sense that White obvi- ously stands better in any case, Fischer's point in exchanging is that he can clearly envisage an ending in which his active rooks, Black's weak d-pawn, and a potential passed pawn on the queen side give White all the trumps. Fischer's 22 Qixd7+! has been talked about and praised for years, perhaps as much as any individual move in the last century.

JiLb4+ 6 Bd2 Rxd4 7 Nxb4 Rxe4+ 8 Jl.e2 aa6 9JLc3(DJ I suspect that Fischer himself would con- sider this position easily winning. He has a strong bishop versus a restricted knight with pawns on both sides of the board. Tn the mean- time, Black is tied to the defence of the weak a6-pawn. In addition. White has much superior activity for his rooks and a passed pawn looms on the queenside. The first two of these advan- tages alone would probably suffice. It seems to me that this is another example of how strong players aren't thinking in terms of some theo- retical preconception (in this case regarding good knights and bad bishops), but using their experience with similar positions and examin- ing specific variations to which they (hen apply their judgement. Thus I'm not convinced that Fischer's move, while obviously worthy of praise, is quite so wonderful as has been claimed. It does exhibit freedom from dogmatism, but in a form not atypical of that seen in many modem games. Furthermore, the decision to exchange is cer- tainly the result of assessing the concrete possi- bilities for Black to free his game. Incidentally, it is often mentioned that some commentators at the time didn't even consider 22 ?)xd7+ as they watched the game. But this isn't very meaningful because they weren't sitting at the board looking as intensely as the players at actual variations regarding issues such as the counterplay via ..Bb5 and the specific se- quence that follows 22 4Bxd7+. Listen to top grandmasters in the press room of any event and you will find that they both miss good moves and suggest horrendous ones quite fre- quently - the games aren't theirs, after all. At any rate, since many readers have seen this This long-term positional pawn sacrifice in order to acquire the advantage of the two bish- ops has become a main line, despite Black's lack of weaknesses. It is known as the Marshall Gambit and has recently become very popular. The moves 9 Na5 and 9 Jldti are also regularly played, which demonstrates that White's idea is positional pressure rather than a specific knockout. Ever since Kasparov started making this kind of pawn sacrifice on a regular basis, other leading players have joined in and found new contexts in which to do so. In this particu- lar line, White has won a large majority of

Benjamin - Anand Groningen PCA J993 There's one remaining situation involving mi- nor-piece pairs that I didn't cover in SOMCS. Sometimes the knight-pair has no compen- sation from permanent weaknesses, outposts, blockaded positions, or activity, but their owner has a direct attack based upon a flank advance and space. This is obviously not a well-defined 18 f4! A big decision. With a bishop on g7, the at- tack by 18 Bh2 b4 19 Bh7+ Nf8 tends to be useless (20 a5! with a counterattack). So White aims for f4-f5, however slow that looks. What's interesting is that Black's pieces are still on the first few ranks, so any attack that he un- dertakes will take time to develop. White tries to ensure this on his next move by placing his knight on the side of the board, sacrificing that piece's potential influence in a kingside attack to stop Black's main idea of ",a5-a<

25...f4 26 5\I2! Ad7 27 b3 (D), when the di-
knight and potential bishop on c4 (or knight, if Black allows 4)b2-c4!) are suddenly very strong indeed. Oddly enough, both of White's knights will be divorced from his attack for the rest of the game! They have important defensive roles to play, and in an occasional line will recentralize to good effect, but most of the game now comes down to space and attack for two bishops, 20Wh2 Stohl initiates a very interesting discussion here about the idea that when one triples on a file, the queen should often stand behind at least one rook- This comes up in a lot of posi- tions and I think is one of those handy 'mini- rules' that has a lot of validity in the theoretical sense. As explained in the discussion about op- posite-coloured bishops, such a guideline strikes me as more useful than most others discussed in this book. It is essentially harmless: no one will forego an effective attack with the queen in front of the rook or vice-versa just because of such a modest suggestion. I have discussed the contrast between this and more sweeping rules elsewhere. Anyway, Stohl examines a number of lines with 20 Sh4, intending Qh2 and later fldhl or Hh7 and Axg7 if possible. He thinks that this is probably an improvement on the game, giving one line with 20,..Qe7! 21 Rh2 *f8! (21..>c6? 22Hh7 Rxa4 23 Sxg7+ *xg7

I must emphasize that the fundamental imbalance of knights versus bishops is the most critical area for the theory of piece-play today. Mastery of this issue in many standard posi- tions and structures has been of decisive impor- tance at the very heights of competition. That was illustrated by Kramnik's revival of the Berlin Defence 1 e4 e5 2 Qf3 4te6 3 Nb5 Qf6

8 Rxd8+ Nxd8, which choice was arguably de-
cisive in gaining him the world championship versus Kasparov. The queenless middlegame that arises pits Black's two bishops against White's space and development, with the value of Black's doubled c-pawns up for debate. We will undoubtedly see a more sophisticated un- derstanding of this sort of trade-off in the years to come. In the meantime, I would recommend the games of Part 2 for study, as well as those in the section on doubled pawns in Chapter 2 be- cause those pawns typically arise from an ex- change of minor pieces.
3.4 Her Majesty as a Subject
I didn't talk that much about queens in SOMCS, and they generally play a small role in strate- gic middlegame literature. This is because the queen is often one of the last pieces out and is so powerful that it can go just about anywhere that it is needed. Thus consistent patterns are hard to discern. In books and articles, discus- sions of the queen normally centre about tac- tics, and specifically queen sacrifices. In this section, I will examine the validity of a few rules that have been posited about queen play. The Relative Value of the Queen Before that, 1 should note that in my and many others' opinion the relative value assigned to the queen has been overstated in a number of situations. That value has changed over the years, always in a negative direction. On the fa- miliar point count scale where pawns are worth 1 point, knights and bishops 3, and rooks 5, queens tend to be assigned 9 points. When I was growing up, a number of elementary books gave their value as 10. and I remember being re- sistant to modifying my belief in this number for some time. Some books used the number 9V2. But I think that it's fair to say that for the last 30 years or so, the accepted number has been 9. Now we know that in every situation, the values of the pieces and pawns vary consid- erably, so one might justifiably consider these numbers to be meaningless. I am inclined to agree that they provide at best shaky grounds when playing a given game. But the scale none- theless reflects a general belief among players about some sort of average value of the piece in question. So let's pursue that. Where does the number 9 come from? I would say that like so many other of our assessments and evaluations, it has to do with the endgame. In the case of two rooks versus a queen and pawn in the ending, for example, we can easily imagine a situation where two rooks (say, on the seventh rank) combine to capture a pawn that is defended by a queen and king. After these pieces are exchanged off, we are in a pawn ending with equal pawns on both sides. So 5+5 = 9+1. 1 would also say that in an ending with a queen on one side and three pieces on the other (with pawns, perhaps on both sides of the board), the queen will tend to hold her own, and probably in more cases than not be able to scarf up a pawn before the minor pieces coordinate and defend each other. It would be interesting to research that case. But what about the middlegame? Here I would suggest that the traditional valuation is no longer respected. Very often we see situa- tions in which three pieces are superior to a queen, this superiority coming right out of the opening and stretching well into the middle- game. Queen 'sacrifices' for three pieces are in creasingly commonplace, and 1 think that most strong players prefer the pieces over the queen in a considerable majority of such situations. Several other commentators have made this point. It is unclear whether they would evaluate the pieces as worth, e.g., 9 J/z on the average in that case, or keep them at 9 but devalue the queen to 8V2; and of course numerous other possible combinations exist, such as separate evaluations depending upon whether there arc two bishops or two knights (this is very likely necessary, assigning a higher point value for the two bishops). AU of that is beyond my precise expertise, but as I see it a relative shift in per ceived relative value has indeed taken place. Then there are more extreme cases. The queen is often sacrificed for material with lesser face value. A queen for two bishops and two pawns (again, in the opening or middlegame, not in the endgame) is a very common ex- change today and I would suggest that the bish- ops hold their own (or perhaps better) as often as not. Interestingly, if you count the queen as 8V2 just for this case, that corresponds with
202 CHESS STRATEGY IN ACTION
Fischer's evaluation of the bishop as 3V<T i.e., 8V2 = 2x3 ¥* + 2. Of course in such a case there are tremendously important issues such as whether the pawns are centre or flank pawns, how early in the game the trade takes place, and more. Remarkably, even the exchange of a queen for two bishops and a pawn is being made more often than one would ever guess. Here the queen is better in the great majority of cases, of course, but a few other factors can in- tervene to change the assessment Of course the bishop -pair need other advantages to achieve a balance with the queen; c.g., better activity, supe- rior pawn-structure and/or development, king- side threats and the like. But since sacrificing an exchange to get two bishops is fairly com- mon today, this view of the material imbalance isn't outrageous. Furthermore, the bishops are often so effective in the middlegame that they can force the win of the exchange, thus return- ing us to material 'parity' at E+A+& = 9 versus W = 9. As one might suspect from what I've said thus far, several top players have also noted that the possession of E+A+A is indeed more desirable than having a queen in many cases (again excluding the endgame, and depending upon which pawn it is, what other pieces are out, etc.). A qualification to all this is that such judgements may stem less from the abstract theoretical truth than from the types of posi- tions actually being played today. Regardless, I believe (and this is only opinion based upon ob- servation) that as time has gone on, players have found the queen less valuable in the mid- dlegame than it has traditionally been assumed. Early Queen Excursions Two traditional rules about the queen have been: a) Don't move the queen out early; b) Don't move your queen into the centre (meaning onto a square that is easy for the op- ponent's naturally centralized pieces to attack, as opposed to squares like e2/c2/c7/c7, which are often safe and often desirable posts). Although common sense might indicate that such queen forays should be punished by loss of time and thus be avoided, that is not always the case. Often an early queen development comes with gain of space and staking out terri- tory in the centre (e.g., 1 e4 d5 2 exd5 UxdS or
1 e4 c6 2 d4 d5 3 EM2 c5 4 exd5 Rxd5). Fur-
thermore, when the queen is attacked, the piece or pawn doing so may not be in an ideal posi- tion for that pawn-structure. Such a case could arise after 1 e4 c5 2 c3 d5 3 exd5 t}xd5 4 d4 4tf6, for example. Then an eventual move c4 will often be undesirable because it weakens squares like d4 and doesn't really assist devel- opment, whereas 4k3 can only be played after moves like 5 4Af3 Ag4 6 Ae2 e6 7 Ae3 cxd4 8 cxd4, by which time Black can argue that nei- ther the bishop on e2 nor the one on e3 (a bad bishop, formally speaking) is as aggressively placed as White would like. Of course that is no great discovery, but the number of instances in which players are intentionally exposing their queens to tempo loss for the sake of other goals is on the increase. It seems to me that most early queen moves are in positions with one's centre pawns on the second or third ranks, and possibly but not al- ways with another pawn on the fourth rank. That is true in our Scandinavian and Sicilian examples, but also in fianchetto openings like the English Opening with 1 c4 e6 2 d4 b6 3 e4 Ab7 4 Qc3 Ab4 5 Rc2 Rh4 or the Trompow- sky with I d4 Qf6 2 Ag5 Nc4 3 Af4 c5 4 d5 Rb6. A popular variation of the Hyper-Accel- erated Dragon Sicilian goes 1 e4 c5 2 4)f3 g6 3 d4 Ag7 4 c4 and now 4...1Wa5+ or 4. ..Rb6 (D). Other Sicilian Defences with the move include 1 e4 c5 2 Qf3 e6 3 d4 cxd4 4 41xd4 a6 5 5k3 b5 6 Ad3 SQ>6!? and 1 e4c5 2 f3 Sc6 3 d4cxd4 4Qxd4 Qf6 5 4k3 d6 6 Ac4 "Fb6 (D):
HER MAJESTY AS A SUBJECT 203
To unify the discussion, let me use as a mod- em test case an opening that has become re- markably popular: the 1 c4 d5 2 cxd5 4fxd5 variation of the Scandinavian Defence, This is an older opening that from early on was given as inferior by theoreticians of every stripe. Ba- sically, it was considered a simple violation of both rules above, and therefore had to give White the advantage, presumably more than in a conventional opening. Quoting Curt Hansen from his excellent CD about the Scandinavian: "After the 1920s 2...Qxd5 was for many years only played very seldom at top level, and no se- rious grandmaster would have this variation as one of his main opening lines when defending against 1 e4J' Yet it has become quite respect- able in the last two decades, beginning with Larsen's revival of it, which really attracted at- tention after his defeat of Karpov at Montreal
1979. The same year one of the most important
and instructive ideas in the whole opening ap- peared. Djuric - Larsen Copenhagen 1979

£tf3 JLfS 6 ±c4 41bd7 7 Re2 e6 8 Nd2 (D) Benko developed this variation and it has been a favourite of Sicilian players for many years. Yes, the queen will lose a tempo to -fi_e3 at some point (e.g., after? Qb3 e6 8 ie'3 4fc7); but the idea is to force the d4-knight to retreat (note that Black's centre is strengthened after 7 4&xc6 bxc6), when the lack of advanced pawns on Black's part means that the same knight will often want to return to d4 to support the attack after f4-f5 or g4-g5. In that case, Black has lost one tempo (...Rb6 c7) and White has lost two (Qb3-d4). There are many other examples; e.g., the main-line Scotch Opening with 1 e4 e5 2 Qf3 5k6 3 d4 exd4 4 ftxd4 iLc5 5 Ae3 Qf6; or the Czech Variation of the Pirc Defence with 1 e4 d6 2 d4ftf6 3 Nc3 c6 4 f4 Ra5 (D). White was always considered better in such positions until the following breakthrough idea was discovered:

Rb6 Hansen: "This idea took so long to find be- cause everybody seemed to have been focusing on Black's weak dark squares after the exchange Notice that the openings mentioned so far (the Scotch excepted) are modem ones, i.e., they didn't really catch on until a few decades ago or less.

The resilience of various lines for Black is re- markable: when one head is cut off, one or two more spring up. An extreme case of this would be the following line, considered decisively re- futed for many years. Black's little-played idea and Stefan Biicker's analysis (from an article in Kaisxiber magazine #6) may yet prove to be un- sound and f could have chosen something more established* but I thought that the friskiness of Here we have a now-standard two knights vs two bishops structure than can also occur in the Caro-Kann and Slav Defences, very often with equality. One idea is that White's dark-squared bishop is a poor one, and that Black's firm grip on d5 makes a pawn advance to that square (which would free the bishop) very difficult. Apart from that, Black's structure limits White's other bishop, and Black for his part can look to various plans (a well-timed ."e5 or ...c5, for example) to establish full equality. There are actually several other factors that help Black, including the fact that he can threaten to ex- change one of White's bishops and either force concessions or succeed in doing so. This range of ideas is almost precisely that which arises in several Slav Defence variations.

A dynamic struggle erupts into a slugfest as Black pits structure and develop- ment against While's space and flank attack. To maintain the balance, Black risks putting his king in the centre, even though that allows an immediate line-opening move against it. The queen's role is at first to support Black's pieces. Then at the key moment, instead of retreating to a safe square indicated by the pawn-structure, an active move seems to justify the whole mid- dlegame strategy. Egger - Soppe Manila OL 1992

International Correspondence Master Mi- chael Melts has specialized in this move and written a fascinating book about it. 3...49a5 has always taken preference here, but 3...1Sd6 is also logical because it covers key central squares like e5 and d4. At first glance the queen looks vulnerable to attack by Jlf4, but this proves hard to arrange and not always effective.

205 CtfESS STRATEGY IN ACTION
None of Chis is very shocking, of course, but it docs indicate that a move like 3...Rd6 in the Scandinavian, previously dismissed by nearly all strong players, deserves the more open- minded attention that it has been receiving recently. GM Ian Rogers, for example, got a good game with it in a rapidplay game against Kasparov himself in Batumi 2001.

Be that as it may, more evidence that wandering around with the queen in the open- ing can be reasonable is offered by the line

Before continuing, I think that Mehs's com- ments are pertinent: "In many chess books we read that one of the main principles of the open- ing is 'Don't move your queen into the centre' 1' He then goes on to quote Suetin, who explains that nevertheless " Very characteristic of certain modem openings is the active role of the major pieces, if their manoeuvres disrupt the oppo nent's plans and assist the favourable coordina- tion of one's own forces?' Melts give a list of nine opening variations for which this is true, including: a) 1 e4 e5 2 <ftc6 3 Nb5 a6 4 Axc6 dxc6 5 O-O Udb b) 1 e4e6 2d4d5 3 d2c5 4exd5"xd5 5 5 gf3 cxd4 6 Jkc4 Rd6. c) J e4 c5 2 < f3 d6 3 d4 cxd4 4 Qxd4 <bc6 5 kb5 Bd7 6 Rd3. d) 1 e4 c5 2 c3 2tf6 3 e5 Sd5 4 d4 cxd4 5 1Brxd4 e6 6 Qf3 Qc6 7 Re4. e) 1 d4Qf62c4 g6 3Qc3 d5 4'Qf3 Ng7 5 WbS dxc4 6 Rxc4.

One can make comparable points about the early deployment of the queen in many other openings, several of which are mentioned in the introductory note to this last contest. I think that, just as in other parts of the game, players are taking a closer look at what they can get away with in this area and what benefits might accrue. I haven't touched upon the related idea of queens moving to the flank to capture pawns or otherwise harass the opponent, but similar considerations apply. One might wish to refer to SOMCS for examples. In general, these phenomena are reflections of the growing spirit of experimentation that pervades contemporary chess, and I'm sure that weTl be seeing more of them in the near future.

Better Part 2: Modern Games and Their Interpretation In Part 2 Tve picked out various games that ex- emplify important ideas of modem chess. They often deal with a particular type of position dis- cussed in the book. The choice of such games has been a purely subjective one, since every is- sue of New In Chess, ChessBase Magazine, Informator, ChessFublishing, Chess Today, and just about any international or national maga- zine has a few or very many games that are temptingly representative of numerous ideas at the same time. My goal has been to give a fla- vour of how the strategic themes that I've out- lined in both this book and SOMCS are realized in actual practice, warts and al], I haven't for the most part chosen well-known or famous games, although a few were irresistible. Nor have I emphasized the spectacular. Neverthe- less, it is nice to have some pretty tactics here and there; in some cases they can remind us of how so much of contemporary chess comes down to justifying apparently anti -positional and committal strategies from which there is no turning back. Instead of taking the modern era as a whole, I have predominantly chosen my examples from the last 10-15 years, with an occasional whimsical exception. That in a sense gives us the peak of the evolutionary trail and by default embraces earlier developments. We live in in- teresting times, however cursed that makes us; again and again I have included games with top-notch ideas that simply wouldn't have got more than a glance as recently as the 1970s and even 1980s, much less in the 1 940s to 1960s (as creative as those times of course were). The selection of representative games re- sembles what I did at the end of SOMCS, but there I took all my games from two Infonnators and didn't annotate them in any depth- Here I try to give comments and analysis for the game as a whole, and I have also imbedded other important games in the notes that I think illustrate related themes. My idea has been to present instructive games combined with illus- trative examples pertinent to the game continu- ation. Most of the time the main contest is both the most thematic and entertaining, but once in a while the subsidiary games contain ideas that are more interesting than the main contest; in those cases I may have opted for organiza- tional convenience or perhaps the imbedded games have been rapidplay games containing too many flaws. On that subject, however, I be- lieve that some games with short time-limits can highlight the basic tendencies of the play- ers involved because we see their instinctive re- sponses. Remember that this book's emphasis is on how modem ideas and strategies arc re- flected tn actual play, regardless of their suc- cess. Naturally I believe that the use of these ideas leads to superior results, even on a very low level of play, but not in every game! At any rate, those of an investigatory bent might first want to have some fun getting an overall im- pression of the flow of the game and then pick out what seems of interest to go over more seri- ously. Finally, one should note that while I sometimes try to dig into the details of the opening, these examples by no means consti- tute an opening survey and woe to the player who treats them as such!

But this turns out to be a very clever waiting move, one which also elim- inates one of Black's thematic ideas in this po- sition, i.e., . -- gS, which would get rid of the important central defender on f3. Apart from that typically modern prophylactic function, there are pos itive aspects of the move including among others the possibility of anchoring a piece on g5 and (you never know) attacking the kingside by Kh3-g3. But surely Black can utilize the extra tempo handed him? To gain some insight into that question, it's instructive to compare two alter- natives to 6 h4. The first is 6 d4, which is proba- bly best met by 6,..c5, when White really can't do anything about the liquidation of the centre. The second is 6 Qfc2, to which an active solu- tion is 6.,.4k6!? intending 7 ftxe4 (7 Be2 Qg5!) 7...Nb4 8 ti bl dxc4 9 Qxe4 Jld7 and "._fi_c6, with plenty of compensation for a pawn.

Either the knight will fall or some horrible sequence with Rd6+ and Rb8+ will follow* A wonderful game, somewhat lost in the ava- lanche of more conventional brilliancies we are seeing these days. Game 2 Dautov - Lputian Istanbul OL 2000 This game illustrates a number of modem themes such as an early flank attack, the treat- ment of two bishops versus two knights, and pure pragmatism. 1 d4d52c4e63#k3 Be7 Black attempts to avoid the main lines of the Exchange Variation of the Queen's Gambit. By playing this move-order, he avoids 3../?Bf6 4 cxd5 exd5 5 Jlg5. 4 cxdS exd5 5 Af4 c6 6 e3 Af5 For some years, this position seemed to solve most of Black's problems in such a pawn-struc- ture since White would usually like to play -Nd3 and force Black's c8-bishop to develop more passively on e6. Instead, the exchange of bishops after Bd3 is pretty lame* The dilemma led Botvinnik to find a unique and counter- intuitive solution: 7g4l? A 'beginner's move* that violates the princi- ple of early flank moves and apparently weak- ens the defence of the side of the board on which the white king will eventually reside. The point is, quite simply, to gain space*

This not only moves one of White's two de- veloped pieces to a passive square, but also blocks the development of his other pieces! However, it is quite a reasonable move that pre- vents and prepares Rg4, An alternative is 10 Hh3, to threaten the kingside by Hg3.

Black has only one piece out, and it's a knight on the edge of the board!

White abandons castling in favour of attack. This turns out badly because the rook gets in the way of White's ideal plan of f4, g4, f5> etc. 12-"c4! Black is crazy! He takes away the best square for his now useless-looking knight. Just as sur- prisingly he is giving up his queenside play by, for example, moves like ...He8, ...cxd4, and ...Qc4. Why would he make this move, which is so often suicidal in the Winawer French? It turns out that Black is cutting off White's pieces from the defence of the queenside. However slowly Black reorganizes to attack on that wing, he feels that he stands solidly enough to counter any type of kingside attack by his opponent. It turns out to be an excellent and far-seeing move.

Game 8 Kasparov - Portisch Mkftf 7983 Moving back a few years, let's see how Kas- parov implements his philosophy of 'splitting the board in two', as well as the kind of dy- namic line-clearing that has so influenced his contemporaries.

MODERN GAMES AND THEIR INTERPRETATION 227
pawns that are unsupported, and the only free- ing move, ".f5, can further expose the light squares after exf5. For all these points, thou- sands of games have proved the viability of Black's position, which received crucial sup- port at world-class level from Kramnik. Now the opening is in as good a shape as it has ever been and recently supplied Leko the critical edge in his qualification for the world champi- onship reunification matches. Today's tourna- ment players are getting so thoroughly familiar with this position that, as I have indicated about other opening ideas, they have likely forgotten the wholesale scepticism with which Black's set-up was once viewed. This reflects again the predominance of the concrete over the general. Naturally, Black must have his own advantages in this position or it wouldn't be playable. They are, among others, the bishop-pair (which pres- ently looks inferior to the knight-pair), and the long-term idea of recapturing the centre by use of his central majority, as crazy as that looks. It's just that those advantages and others are self-evident neither to the classically-educated player nor even to the top-level modern prag- matists of some few decades ago. Also, it took the most concrete demonstration imaginable that White's numerous ideas such as c4T c3 + 4k2-e3, Jld3 + or even jfi_xb5 (long con- sidered a near-refutation) were ultimately an- swerable. Thus the theoretical justification for Black's play was post-facto, i.e., rhe play came fust and then the abstract explanation. A close look at ideas from the radical breakthroughs in the 1940s to this day shows that they share that pragmatic and non-general character, a trend that has greatly accelerated in every decade since then. 10"Jke7 This move avoids the doubled pawns in the last diagram, but forfeits thereby the opportunity to strike quickly at White's centre with ...f5.

Here we see the elementary ideas of a4 and 4ke3 approaching, albeit no hint yet of actu- ally developing other pieces! 13 b8 Yet another paradoxical move, undevelop- ing.

Black's disdain for both key squares and development Game 10 Kasparov - Shirov Morgen 1994 I've tried to avoid the most famous games of modem chess because they have already been so thoroughly talked about. There is plenty of material elsewhere. Nevertheless, this over- exposed game is loaded with modem ideas, even if one can be distracted by the unusual and brilliant fashion in which they are executed.

Here we see disadvantages that the great majority of advanced players as late as the 1960s and 1970s still blanched at: the combination of the backward pawn on d6 and that glaring hole on d5 was a bit much even for experimental types. Then there were the con- crete and intimidating difficulties posed by both of White's logical next moves.

The other reasonable move and main line to- day is 10 Jkxf6gxf6 11 ftd5 (N). Now the extent of Sveshnikov's heresy be- comes clear; Black is slightly behind in devel- opment and has lost control of d5 (which can be reinforced in various ways, e.g. by a later Qc2-e3). His queenside is subject to poten- tially devastating pawn breaks such as c4 or a4 which can put the light squares permanently in White's hands. He has also taken on doubled

I really don't want to query this natural move, since Shirov can hardly be faulted for making the most active and challenging one, even if he saw Kasparov's next move. Black has a short- age of choices. An oddball line is 16... tc6? 17 Ec4!

left to a book on theory. After Shirov's 16...Ck5T I have to give a diagram, even though this posi- tion has been overexposed: The exception is his powerful knight on d5, but Black has plenty of time to reorganize around it. Kasparov's next move reveals the real, un- derlying idea. 17-.Qxb718b4! Terrific! White restricts the b7-knight from coming into play viac5; e.g., 18 Bc4 O-O 19 O-O ?k5 20 f3 Jkg5 followed by ideas like ...31e6, ...a5, and ...5k7, swapping White's most domi- nant piece. Let's take stock for a moment. I will follow John Nunn's description of the play thus far, with a few additional comments. He points out that White has violated: a) The rule that one should castle quickly. OK, it's rare but not unheard of to go 18 moves without castling, but in fact he waits until move 25 to do so! b) The rule that one shouldn't move the same piece twice in the opening; White has moved his knights seven times and in fact they are the only pieces developed. Furthermore, his next two moves are knight moves! c) The rule that one should develop one's rooks to central files. Instead he has played Exa4, Hb4 and Sxb7.
18._S.g5 19 <5\a3! O-O 20 "k4
That makes seven moves by the same knight. This puts pressure on the d6-pawn and threatens a jump to b6 in some lines. Of course it's im- possible to look into his head, but one suspects that Kasparov wasn't thinking 'I'd better get some pieces out', but undogmatically treated the position purely in terms of concrete posi- tional strategy. Nunn also makes a strong point that I have not emphasized enough with respect to modem play: White's play here is not illogi- cal, i.e., he isn't intentionally breaking rules nor playing chaotically That way of thinking just doesn't enter the picture. But Kasparov is following a logical and consistent strategy; in Nunn's words, his moves "form a seamless whole1. 20,"a5 21 Bd3 axb4 22 cxb4 W)8 This is a reasonable move, trying to initiate action on the a-file after ...Na2, ...Ra7, etc. Nunn shows that the alternatives 22...Ha2?! and 22...Jlh6?! leave White with a good posi- tion. Instead, he recommends the strange move
22...Sb8!? with the idea ...Rd7 and ...Qd8.
This is a bit slow, and White has plenty of ideas, e.g. Qh5, O-O, g3 and f4. At any rate, very few 17fixb7!I Yet another modem theme: the exchange sacrifice. The move is shocking, because mate- rial is somewhat reduced and White doesn't have much development, the two bishops, or other traditional compensation for the exchange.
MODERN GAMES AND THEIR INTERPRETATION 229
After 38."iLxe3 39 Hxe3, White is not only the exchange ahead; he has the b-pawn and at- tacking prospects as well. It's amazing how often seemingly irrational dynamism, impossible for the normal human to assess, pervades modem games, The purely po- sitional factors tend to be of less importance in such slugfests, of course, but they still lurk be- low the surface and are important for the under- standing of most of them. The next two games provide wild and enjoyable examples. Game 11 Serper - Nikolaidis St Petersburg 1993

Again, this passive move seems a poor trade- off for the active play that we have seen in the Sveshnikov. But it is a case of 'bad bishops pro- tecting] good pawns' (Suba), Le., if the pawn that holds up your entire structure is guarded by a bad bishop, are you about to complain? Black's d6-pawn, despite being backward, is in fact his most important one, and it is also the second centre pawn (versus one for White) that constitutes Black's fundamental advantage in the Sicilian Defence Regarding move-order, by the way, Black would like to avoid 6~.Qf6 7 Jig5 t which cre- ates doubled pawns after 7...a6 8 Bxf6 gxf6 9 5c3. 7 1c3a6 8 a3f5'?(D) A sort of beginner's move that tries to break down White's centre and operate along the f-filc.

A noteworthy move that uses a tempo to make the c7 -bishop even worse and releases the pressure on e4! However, it also serves two im- portant practical functions. First, thecl-bishop is cut off from play, and what may not be imme- diately evident is that White's a3-knight can't swing to its ideal destination on e3 (controlling f5 and d5). The main alternative is 9."fxQ4, which is still theoretically unclear. 10g3I? Ultimately this doesn't work out, although it's almost impossible to ascertain whether it should have done. Black has done well in the few games from this position, an extremely dy- namic and entertaining example being 10 4&c2 4Mi6!? 11 b3 O-O 12 Qk!5 Jtg5 (Black's devel- opment is bizarre but difficult to refute) 1 3 Be2 Jke6 14 Ab2 *h8 15 Rd3 Hc8 16 ±c3 b5 !?

Logical enough. The threat is exf5, so White is developing with tempo to emphasize his light-square advantage. But today 9 _fcd3 is very rarely played, because Black's reply has driven it from mainstream practice. Today, almost ev- eryone plays 9 exfS Bxf5 10 J&.d3, although 1 0 Qc2 is a particularly interesting alternative.

MODERN GAMES AND THEIR INTERPRETATION 235
This is a very common English Opening po- sition, usually arrived at by the move-order 2 Qc3 "k6 3 g3 g64 Ng2 Ag7 5 Qf3 e6. 6d4!?(DJ pieces while White fiddles about trying to re- gain the pawn. And that pawn recovery may not even happen, because after ...cxd4 and White's Qb5, Black can play ...Rb6. Then, White's only apparent resource would be to keep Black's king in the centre by 4kl6-K But that, as strong players know by dint of experience with other openings, would actually speed up Black's de- velopment (and the king is normally very com- fortably placed on e7). As if all that weren' t bad enough. Black might be able to capture by
6...ftxd4 7 Qxd4 Axd4 without creating a tar-
get on d4; he might then cover the dark squares by means of "Be5. Thus, by all reasonable thinking according to general principle, and employing not just traditional but deeply in- grained instinctive reasoning, 6 d4 has to be wrong. It should al the very most barely equal- ize purely because White gets the first move in chess. I myself worked on the English Opening for years (with a 4-volume set devoted to it) and, fully aware of d4 sacrifices in similar posi- tions, I didn't believe that 6 d4 was sound, nor did any other theoretician that I know of. What happened? T don't think that there is much of a mystery here. Modem chess, and in a more extreme fashion the chess of the last few decades, has increasing turned to specific and unprejudiced analysis of positions, taking the pragmatic attitude that anything might work if you give it a chance, ugly or counter-intuitive as it might be. This approach has dearly been assisted, often in an indispensable way, by the introduction of computer analytical engines. Thus players have used an unnatural method to find some of these new ideas. But that's not the whole point, because in doing so they have opened their minds to accept the pragmatic analytical approach described throughout this book. And computers still don't, as far as I know, come up with or at least recommend 5-"e6 6 d4 (especially not intending 6...Nxd4 7 Qkxd4 cxd4 8 4)e4, the way this line was con- ceived and achieved its original successes), The less so do they find the move 7 d4 in the next paragraph. Here is a side note dedicated to the creative grandmaster Tony Miles, who recently died. With both experience and imagination assisting him, Miles discovered the outrageous idea 1 c4 c5 2 ?k3 3 g3 g6 4 Bg2 Jkg7 5 Qf3 e5 Today this is a mainstream and respectable move. For years. White struggled to find any sort of answer to 5...e6 that promised interest- ing play, and this is a sound continuation that does so. But as far as I know, 6 d4 was played only once before the 1980s in the isolated game Lengyel Bilek, Budapest 1964 White went wrong in two more moves and got the worse game. But why after so many years of games with this line did no one else come up with 6 d4 until recently? Some leading players and numerous grandmasters didn't. For exam- ple, Petrosian suffered a critical loss in this line against Fischer in the 1970 USSR vs RoW match and in my database never won with White in several other contests. In general White tended to approach this position passively and ceded the centre to Black; his plans included d3, b3, e3, and a3. Given the poor performance of other reactions to 5"x6 (47%-53% in Black's favour), 6 d4 would at least have been a very handy practical weapon. Did players up to re- cent times lack good positional instincts? Of course not. What then? Were they somewhat wedded to the instinctive belief that such a move has to be, if not completely unsound, eas- ily and quickly subject to neutralization? That's a different matter. Most reasonable people will agree that White should not or cannot give up a crucial centre pawn at this juncture. For one thing Black can always play an early ".d5, tak- ing the initiative in the centre and activating his

7 d4 has appeared in grandmaster practice
again suggests how many new moves arc being examined without particular prejudice, moti- vated only by the belief that they might work. 6".xxd4 This isn't a bock on theory, but it's relevant to see that White has good compensation in a fascinating position after 6...?)xd4 7 $Bxd4 cxd4 (7" ,j[xd4 8 Nb5 Le5 9 O-O ties Black up) 8 4Be4!(D/ A surprising move as opposed to the natural

Remember that the classical Open Games and middlegame formations were also evolving during the modern period from 1940-1990, and they continue to do so today. The number of structures that are considered terribly passive or drawish has strikingly diminished. In prac- tice, players have found ways to play originally in what seemed to be thoroughly researched territory. In 1 <14 <15 lines, for example, those fa- miliar with Slav Defence theory can understand that the positionally-oriented players of that opening in the 1920s and 1930s would be taken aback by the wild and exotic paths this "solid' opening has taken in so many variations. Pawns are gambited freely, pawn-structures are thor- oughly compromised for long-term dynamic compensation, and no one flinches at things like severely delayed development or strange flank pawn advances. But there's always been the feeling that the bastion of 1 d4 d5 defences, the Orthodox Queen's Gambit Declined, was not subject to radical change. After all, this was the opening which prompted the "death of chess' predictions from Capablanca and Lasker. It was said that the variations were too thoroughly worked out to provide enough opportunity for the strong player to avoid a draw against a well- prepared but inferior opponent. We have already seen in Chapter 1, Section 1 (The Surrender of the Centre) how the main lines of yesteryear have been replaced by new and more dynamic ones. But it's even true of a simple structure like the Queen's Gambit Exchange Variation; new ideas are possible. Here is a case in point: Game 14 Khouseinov- Magomedov Dushanbe 1999 I d4 dS 2 c4 e6 3 ?Jf3 6 4 Qc3 Ae7 5 cxd5 exd5 6 Jlg5c6 7Sc2 To prevent Bf5 and to stay flexible. 7w fta6 This flank development has become more popular of late. 8a3 A common option is 8 c3, when 8...Qb4 9 W (9 Wbl g6 and ..

Of course there are many such, even going back to the 19th century, although these occur infre- quently relative to today and often in a context where the players had little choice as to the strategy they chose. In this game, played only a year after my original 'dividing point* for modem chess, Black's play is strategically way ahead of its time and would not be out of place on any level today. This game's setting reflects the evolving Soviet chess milieu from which stemmed the radical theoretical advances of the second half of the 1930s. Id4£tf6 2c4g6 3?k3Ng7 4e4d6 Right away we have signs of modernity: the King's Indian Defence was relatively rare up to 1935, and in fact was played almost 8 times as much in the period 1936-70 as in 1900-35. In addition, the Sfrnisch Variation seen in this game (5 f3) was more popular after 1935.

But 13".Nxg3 14 hxg3, giving While the doubled pawns, probably would not appeal to many masters today: it not only opens the h-file, but makes counterplay particularly difficult. In the end, 13...f4 is probably the right choice. 14Nxh5gxh5 Now the g-file is potentially useful, and as for h5, the saying that *a weakness that can't be attacked isn't a weakness' applies, at least to some extent. 15Af2a6 Stopping Nb5 and allowing a unique reorga- nization of Black's pieces. The advance ...b5 lurks in the background as well. White can take solace from the fact that he controls more space, his bishops are more active, and Black's queenside is compromised.
16 Nd3 (DJ
White looks better in almost every respect; two active bishops, pawn-structure, space in the centre and on the queenside, and then there's that g7-bishop of Black's. He should have a very large advantage and indeed has some, but the position is deceptive, and Black begins to manoeuvre behind the lines as in so many mod- em structures.

Neither Black's queen nor any of his pieces is particularly well placed, but he will now pro- ceed to wander at length with his king, his dark-squared bishop, and his knight, coming out just fine in the end! 27*flh4 Someday ...h3 may come in handy, and in the meantime this discourages g3. 28h3I? With this move, closing the kingside, White announces that he will try to win solely on the queenside. I'm not so sure. A hole on g3 is opened up on an open file and more importantly, White permanently forfeits the possibility of opening up a second front by g3 after, say, tying Black's pieces to the defence of the queenside. 28~*g6 29 JLel ?k7!

An extremely interesting positional game re- flecting the new pragmatism of computer play, in this case the willingness to play several clas- sically anti-positional moves. I have generally avoided correspondence games because it is over-the-board decisions that I am largely (although not exclusively) concerned with, i.e., whether players chink in abstract or concrete terms and how typically modem their natural ideas are. It would be silly to make that a hard-and-fast rule if for no other reason than that any strategic vision that char- acterizes an age should be reflected in all forms of the game (even blitz chess!). Thus corre- spondence games must also reflect the spirit of the times. Sanakoev's book World Champion at the Third Attempt covers many years of cre- ative play. His play in the following game from three decades ago is surprisingly modem and would probably seem impractical to most strong players since Black accepts a dismal-looking, cramped position. But it takes a certain sound- ness in one's systems to play in the correspon- dence world championship, so we should not lightly dismiss this one. In fact, similar strate- gics are being seen more often today and may prove to be theoretically acceptable. The game is at any rate an illustration of how an elastic position can tie the opponent down to preventa- tive measures and then explode into activity in the middlegame.

A shocking decision that commits to ex- changing Black's powerful king's bishop (argu- ably his only strung piece) in order to achieve queenside play.

Game 18 Hodgson - Adams WrjJt aan Zee 1993 Games with the Trompowsky Attack tend to ig- nore the classical rules more than those stem- ming from any other opening. This game is in that sense typical, A flank move on move 3 sur- renders the two bishops, knights develop to the rim, doubled pawns are debated, and finally the two knights beat the two bishops in an open po- sition without outposts. Id4 f62 g5 It's always fun to talk about the Trompow- sky, since the bishop develops on only the sec- ond move and because it took so very long to catch on. Right away we have a violation of 'knights before bishops1, and play extraordi- narily often takes a radically untraditional path. One might say: 'Oh, but thaf s such an excep- tional opening that it really doesn't help to make a case about modem play*. That sounds plausible until you realize how accepted 2 Jlg5 has become. My main database has just under 14,000 games with it - more than, for example, the Dragon Variation, the Scandinavian De- fence, far more than the Classical French after 4 Ag5 _fi_e7, and about the same as the Najdorf Variation. And the Trompowsky is not just a fa- vourite of certain lower-strength players.

There are several reasonable moves here, and I won't go into the theory. 4 dS <Nxg5 5 hxgS g6 White has ideas of g6 in this line, crippling Black's pawn-structure; this move puts an end to that notion while taking over the long diago- nal, 6Qc3d67a4 A sort of waiting flank move (White still only has one piece out!), which in some cases intends a5, but also provides for a defence to his weakened squares along the al-h8 diagonal. 7" Jlg7 8 >d2 "fb6!

But his position is so passive that it's hard to imagine those being in- fluential factors. In fact, my computer engines, so often sensitive to pawn- structure defects, both like Black here. If you follow my advice from SOMCS, White should make some active change in the pawn -structure to secure himself outposts (or should already have done so). In what follows, he does no such thing, but slowly but surely makes his knights superior to two bishops on an open board! This is another illus- tration of how there are few reliable strategic rules or even recommended procedures in chess. The specifics of this position dominate, and I have to admit that what I've said elsewhere about knight and bishop-pairs just doesn't apply

There follows 46 f7 'Rc8 r 47 W18 3e6f . Bronznik brings attention to the next game as an example of flank pawn advances versus a classical centre. White keeps two centre pawns on the second rank and another on the third while dancing around with his pieces on the edge of the board. One should also notice the early commitment on White's part to forego castling, and the development of the rooks on wing files and across the ranks. White's play as a whole is almost a satire on role-breaking. I don't think that this game proves anything about the superiority of flank play or central play, but it does demonstrate the legitimacy of a very flex- ible and latently dynamic set-up against even the solidest of positions. This reminds one of the Hedgehog systems as Black, certain Sicilian De- fences with -b5 and ..-h5, and many variations of the English Opening as White. In addition, we get an example of both a queenside flank pawn advance (rare in my exposition of wing play) and a kingside pawn attack at the end. Game 22 Nadanian - Ponomariov Kiev 1997 I£rf3d52b4 A rather bold flank advance against Pono- mariov, who is not only one of the world's best players but very much at home with the classi- cal central development that he now pursues-

9...O-O 10 a6! b6
Now we have a truly remarkable situation. As Bronznik points out, White has made nine
254 O/ESS STRATEGY IN ACTION
pawn moves out of thirteen, almost all on the flank. Of the four remaining moves, three have been by rooks, which incidentally has deprived him of castling rights! And of course White has allowed his pawns to be doubled. Ponomariov has by contrast played exclusively moves that secure the centre, develop pieces, and protect the king. For all of that, it is now difficult for Black to find any plan, and White has several ways to improve his position. In this regard, White's play may be said to have been primar- ily prophylactic. 13".?te8 14 Rh5 Bronznik mentions the alternatives 14 Hg5!? and 14 h5!?. I think that both of these give White some advantage.

White's opening has resulted in a classic case of two knights versus two bishops, and an example of the doubled f-pawn structure that we looked at in Chapter 2, Section 2. This is one of those cases where White hopes that his temporary lead in development and space ad- vantage will translate into good squares for his knights before Black can get developed and free his bishops. ll_Ae7 12 Zfel O-O 13 Sadi aS Pelletier feels that 13...Rb6 was better, with the idea ..._fi.d7, ...Sfd8, ...Be8. That has a Laskcriau look to it and has its points, because Black wants to consolidate and not allow White to open up the game. But Yusupov's plan is more active and looks adequate. 14 e5a4 15a3Wa5(D) It's interesting to see how two such strong players approach this position. Now Yusupov has restrained White's queenside and put his queen on a comfortable square. He still has the problem of developing his other pieces, but that depends upon specific tactics. 16Ze3!?

Alekhine's Defence (I .J?tf6) used to be called the most hypermodem of openings. It teetered for years on the brink of respectability, but was usually looked down upon by the world's elite and even the middle-tier grandmasters . Recently it has achieved mainstream status and has been used by top stars and numerous leading grand- masters. It seems to me characteristic of the last two decades that literally every opening is be- ing reinvestigated and that most of them are be- ing found to be playable. One thing that has led to the revival of Alekhine is that Black has adopted the modem spirit of extreme flexibil- ity. This game is an example.

This move first occurred in W. Watson-Babu- rin, Kilkenny 1994. As discussed briefly in Chapter 2, Section 2 (Doubled Pawns in Ac- tion), a capture on c3 or c6 is probably the most common way of inflicting isolated doubled pawns in chess. But it's still surprising to see Black give his opponent the two-bishop advan- tage and weaken his kingside squares when he isn't very well developed. The real point here is that Black's pieces, especially the queen and knights, are so ready to take up ideal and/or ac- tive posts over the next few moves. 14 bxc3 <Sdxc5 15 ?kl4 Ra5 16 Rc2 16 b3!?

Also, an eventual advance by f3 and e4 would create the kind of big centre that the two bish- ops adore. Of course, Black still controls key squares and can hardly stand badly.

£gS It *s easy to forget how sceptical people were of what is now this main line when it first ap- peared, especially after so many years of tra- ditional developing moves at this point. The knight foray to g5 is a flexible and intensely pragmatic move that prepares a concrete re- sponse to any logical move by Black, In an odd sense, then, it is more of a prophylactic than an attacking move. That so many top players over- looked its possibilities is likely due to the flagrant violation of the fundamental rule of de- velopment: not to move the same piece twice (excluding recaptures) before bringing out one's pieces. Here White decentralizes the knight with no other pieces out, all for what seems to be a primitive attempt to play for tricks. But it is in fact a complex way of reorganizing White's pieces so that Black has no way to exchange them and must himself develop awkwardly.
5."£gf6 6 Nc4 e6 7 lBfe2 £*6

And now a weakness is created, however small. Naturally Black doesn't want White to develop smoothly by Nlf3. 9£5f3 So White has now moved his knight four times, only to land it on a square that his gl- knight could have gone to immediately. By pre- cluding the gl -knight from developing to its de- sired square, he also prevents the hl-rook from entering the fray! For all that, White's pieces command more space and he will be able to castle queenside quickly to frustrate Black's counterplay This is a little slow now, although the idea of ,..Na5-c4 is still tempting. 21...£Sd81? is an in- telligent option, preparing ...Ne6 and ...c5, but also ...c6 if necessary. 22e4h6 A move that exposes the king in certain lines.

It be- came clear that ultra-dynamic variations such as the Dragon and the Najdorf were not going to be refuted, with Fischer's play and prestige playing a large role in the latter case. At the same time, in the sometimes more positional variations of the Scheveningen and Classical Sicilians, Black's basic Sicilian structure (open c-file, central pawn majority, etc.) were proving to be resistant to the direct attacks by which they had been overrun in earlier times. Slowly the blitzkrieg tactics of a Tai were seen by Sicilian practitioners to be an inevitable danger rather than a threat to the viability of the de- fence as a whole. It is a process that continues (o this day. The necessary corollary to this was that the underlying soundness of various now- standard structures of Black's had to be dem- onstrated. Games like the following helped to establish that and showed something rather dif- ferent too: that Black was able to maintain a

This is typical of Pet- rosian's pro vocative style. He is willing to lose all the long-term prospects for the sake of im- mediate queenside pressure. At first sight, one might not think that e6-pawn is fulfilling the usual doubled pawn function of covering out- post squares, since d5 is adequately protected by the c-pawn. But it is useful to gain the f-file with tempo (e.g., is threatened), because that gives Black just enough time to attack the queenside effectively with moves like ...Hb8, ..Jffa5 and ...Jth4. And it wouldn't be surpris- ing if, after winning a queen side pawn, Petros- ian might have been planning to neutralize In this kind of position Black already has somewhat the better game, since his light- squared bishop will be strong on e6, his knight is better than White's, and he has the open c- file. All this is standard stuff now, but only really began to take hold in the 1950s in the USSR and didn't filter through to the everyday player for some years.

A draw without tac- tics certainly doesn't attract attention. This game has a traditionally strong centre and centralized pieces opposed by pure flank play. The game includes pawn-chains, a king in the centre, a knight on the rim, and an attack against the king initiated on the weak and cramped side of the side of the board. Game 28 Marciano - C.

The next game was the first one that I hap- pened to open to recently when I got a new book on the French Defence. It is a calm enough encounter between players rated around 2500 at the time. 1 decided to include it for fun to il- lustrate the sori of positional battle that tends to go unnoticed these days. Apart from the games 6Nd3 This is a main line of the so-called Guimard Defence to the Tarrasch Variation. 3...Qc6!? is perhaps not the strongest move, but it is the sort of thing that Nimzowitsch liked: to block the c-pawn and therefore break with all traditional advice for such positions. The alternative 6 jLe2 allows Black to challenge the front of the pawn-chain by 6."f6. Similarly, 6 c3 can be met by 6,..f6 when a natural follow-up is 7 Jib5 (7 exf6 Bxf6 8 Jfc.b5 j&.d6 followed by a quick .,.e5) 7".fxe5 8 dxe5 a6 9 Bxc6 bxc6 100-0 c5.

Extremely logical, covering c4, connecting rooks and putting an end to the idea of ...Jlh5
MODERN GAMES AND THEIR /NTERPRETATION 265
White is superbly centralized and has put ev- ery piece to good use 23-g5! Black hasn't even looked at the centre for a long time and has systematically shifted his forces to the quccnside. Yet suddenly he throws out yet another flank pawn on the side of the board where he has almost no pieces! How can this be justified, especially with this central configuration? One idea is just to gain space (as was that behind ...a4); but he might also be able to open lines on the kingside or force White into a weakening of his kingside light squares. In the latter case, the sacrifice ...Qbc4 would be difficult to accept since the c6-bishop would become a very powerful piece. Thus the two flanks coordinate despite Black's pieces being passively placed. This reminds one of the phi- losophy behind the Hedgehog. 24Nel! The alternative of just blocking the kingside and restricting the e7-bishop by 24 g4 hxg4 25 hxg4 allows 25... bc41 (25...sfrc7 26 g2 4>b8, castling by hand, is also possible) 26 ?\xc4 ?)xc4 27 jLxc4 dxc4 28 SLxc4 (D), to exchange the bad bishop. White's play has followed all the rules: protect the pawn -chain, centralize the pieces, take over the open file, and prevent the opponent's freeing moves. Now he is ready to take action.
18."ed7 19 h3 Hc"
Black refuses to castle into the attack, judg- ing his king to be safer in the centre. He might even be contemplating the exotic ...fta8-c7, to support the b5-square. But what then? And what about his rook on h8? 20Nh2! Now the move TiSg4 is in the air and Black still hasn't achieved much on the queenside.
20...115
This looks purely defensive and weakening, but it does more than prevent Rg4 or Uh5, as we shall see. 21 hf3 (DJ White was probably very satisfied here: by luring the pawn to h5, he can now play Bg5 with a nice positional advantage (space, better bishop, and firm control of the centre). 2L.,lBti8! 22Sc3 Again, the classical way to progress, by dou- bling rooks,
22.. d7!
As anticipated some moves ago, presumably even with I6..,J*.c6!. Black thus connects major pieces on his back rank and if need be, his king will be much safer on b8 than on g8 or even in the centre. One thing that bothers White is that there is a sort of mutual stand-off over c4, so that a move by his d3-bishop or d2-knight in- vites one of Black's knights into that square.

The following ultra- flexible line for Black has been around for a few decades and is used by several 2500-2600 players. The average master will almost surely have difficulty handling the associated ideas, and even if in theory it only grants the usual slight edge for White, practice can be another matter. It takes a knowledgeable and sophisti- cated strategic thinker (as in the next game) to achieve decent results as Black. That said, games with this strategic course have so many surprising elements that it is a treat to sit back and enjoy them. Game 29 J. Shahade - Ehlvest Philadelphia 1999 le4g62d4JLg7 An interesting move-order trick pointed out many years ago begins with 2".d6 3 4fc3 c6!? 4 f4 (obviously 4 4Bf3 is a major option) 4".d5!?
5 e5 h5 6 5}f3 g4, which is an improved ver-
sion of the next note. After a typical variation like 7 Ne3 2*6 8 Ae2 Axf3 9 Nxf3 Qf5 10 Bf2 e6, it turns out that the bishop is much better placed on f8 than on g7 both because it isn't blocked by the monster on e5 and because it supports .-c5. So by playing this move-order, Black has in a sense gained two tempi by avoid- ing ...Jlf8-g7-f8. In the meantime, he has lost only one tempo by playing ...d6-d5. 34te3c644tf3

Prophylaxis. 5 eS Bg4 or 5 Jte2 Lg4 is rea- sonably easy for Black, who will exchange the bishop for knight, play the solid . e6 and then aim for ...c5. Ideally, White's centre will be pried apart and Black's knights will find useful squares.
5.J2H16
Oddly enough, a standard move! Black's first idea is that if White plays Be3 soon, ...dxe4 and chases the bishop and the knight stands well. 5~.dxe4 with is the more solid op- tion. 6&f4 Not the only move, but probably the best, developing and covering e5. White plays be- ginner's book chess, and it causes some real problems. For example, if 6...04) 7 e5, White threatens to win a piece by 8 Qd2 and 9 g4. Black's solution is outrageous:
6"J6!? (/J)
This tries to exploit Black's slow and skewed development. The other natural move is 7 Rd2 4Bf7, and now: a) 8 04)4) 04) must be a little better for White, although Black has not done that terribly (at least strong players haven't).

It's astonishing that so many masters have willingly chosen to play this move and to take on any position resembling that in the diagram. Black cuts off his bishop and creates a serious weakness on e6, which makes ...dxe4 risky in view of the open e-file and ideas like Bc4 and The initial point is a rather pathetic one: to provide an escape square on f7 for the knight Beyond that. Black would like to stop Qe5 and, sometime in the distant future, to play ..x5. 7exd5 Notice how White has done everything right: set up a strong centre, got all of his pieces out, centralized the knights, and removed the king to safety. Black has shut out both of his bishops and huddled his pieces miserably on the first two ranks. And yet things aren't so dire for him because there are no obvious targets and his position has a degree of flexibility and elastic- ity (i.e., any attempt to force things by White can lead to a rapid mobilization of the enemy forces).

Game 31 Gulko - Hector Copenhagen 2000 As discussed in the section on flank pawns in Chapter 2, energetic early attacks with the g- and h- pawns are not limited to dynamic open ings such as the Sicilian Defence, Here's a case in which a middlegame that has always been characterized by positional manoeuvring was transformed by an unlikely and almost simplis- tic new strategy, Ic4 f625k3e53£tf3?k64g3?ld4!?5 £gl The capture 5 Nxe5 gives Black a powerful initiative after 5,,.tte7, especially because 6 4tJd3?? allows 6~,Nf3#! That detail provides the needed tactical justification for Black's strategy outlined in the next note. 5", xf3+6Nxf3£M 8_h6I? Black's move is superficially directed against Ag5T which would strengthen White's grip on the light squares. But since that really isn't much of a threat in the line 8,.,O-O 9 Jtg5 hti 10 Axf6 Rxf6 (which is fully equal), we will have to look deeper In fact, 8..,h6 may be aimed at a later Jig5, but it is also turning out to be a pro- phylactic move directed against White's ideas of g4 and h4! That leaves us in the odd situation that a radical strategy, which for years didn't even occur to While (and is so new as to have escaped inclusion in the recent theoretical works on the English Opening), is already fear- some enough that Black desires advance pro- tection from it! We live in fast-changing times. So granting for the moment that Black wants to avoid 8. .O-O 9 g4! followed by g5 and h4 in the new spirit, let's look at a recent game with 8-c6, after which White shamelessly ignores the fact that Black hasn't castled and plays 9

We are getting used to the idea of only lightly supported flank ad- vances on the side of the board opposite to where the other pieces are directed (in this case, the queen on b3, c3-knight and f3-bishop). It*s also remarkable how once again Black's cen- tral counterattack failed so miserably against White's flank advance. Game 32 Petrosian - Korchnoi Aforcow Ct (9) 1971 The first part of this game goes horrifically for Petrosian, who plays it with the apathy that characterized many of his openings over the years. But when you want to see an extraordi- nary strategic game you can hardly go wrong by leafing through those of Petrosian, the true giant of modem positional play. Ic4e52g3c63b3d54Nb2d45ftf3Nd6

Game 33 Shirov - Nisipeanu Las Vegas FIDE 1999 Moving from statics to dynamics, this mighty struggle serves as an extreme example of the unbalanced complications that can arise from the Advance Variation of the Caro-Kann with 5 g4 that I discussed in Chapter 2. We see a mad flank pawn advance, a positional pawn sacri- fice, brilliant and paradoxical attacking ideas, tough and ingenious defence from an elastic position, and above all a thoroughgoing dyna- mism that makes the game so remarkable and fun.

The first key here is in the consideration of the concrete variations, any one of which might instantly refute White's play but may also bear out difficulties that Black faces. Without the ability to see accu- rately and fairly deeply into many potential se- quences, one cannot play in this manner. But naturally there is a limit to any player's ability to calculate precisely and much must be left to a grandmaster's instinct* That consists of a feel for the dynamic possibilities and the assess- ment of the end positions of numerous lines under analysis* The game before you is a won- derful example of these qualities* Perhaps only Kasparov of the world's top players could also play in this way with confidence in both his in- stinct and calculations. 16c4!!fD) A magnificent move, which incidentally sac- rifices a second pawn. Stohl relates that upon seeing this move Nisipeanu nearly fell off his chair!

In the face of ...O-O-O and ..*Nxe5, White would seem to have no choice. Shirov's move still neglects develop- ment and even allows Black to castle on the queenside. His reasoning is that he finally acti- vates his g2-bishop and perhaps prepares possi- ble action on the queenside by means of iLf4 and Ucl (Black of course has options every- where, including ...d4). Nevertheless, is it really possible that being a pawn down with his king 16w ftxe5! A bold and accurate defence. The first thing to realize is that by c4f White has protected his b5-knight; this is non-trivial and affects nearly every variation, Stohl now enters into a lengthy, dense analysis of many wild possibilities to conclude that the text is 'the most demanding move'. By far the most important alternative is 16 ..O-O-O 17 cxd5 Qxe5 (after 17...exd5 Stohl gives 18 Jtf4 or 18 Rc2 b6 19 ftd6+! with su- perior chances), when amazingly, White takes even more time out to play 18 a4! (Z>). We then arrive at a mess that requires analy- sis of four black replies. Stohl finds them all better for White, starting from the relatively easy 18**,a6 19 Uci b6 20 b4? on to variations

A typical Samisdi Variation structure. White has developed harmoniously and has ideas of breaking through on the queenside by <tbl, c5, and EcL Black has a knight on the rim and a bad bishop! Of course it's not that easy, as wc shall see 9 -.f4 just makes the bishop worse and it can't really get out after 10 jLf2 Af6 1 1 4ige2 jfi.h4 12 jLgl . But 9..,Qid7 is a pointed and flex- ible move, with the intention of coming to f6 in most lines and supporting a kingsidc attack. lOerfS!? A committal but perfectly logical move. White wants to get chances on the kingside as well as the quecnside. Two common alterna- tives are 10 4bl and 10 Jld3. 10-~grf5 11 5ige2!?

Black's theoretical structural advantage is on the kingside as well.

these players were dominated by respectable openings, mostly classical and often symmetri- cal ones, to the extent that the complaints about the death of chess expressed by Lasker and Capablanca were based on the remarkably nar- row notion that to be playing truly 'correctly', one somehow had to play 1 e4 or 1 d4 and even respond symmetrically to those moves. (It was also claimed that (hose openings had been 'worked out'!). For a world-class player merely to conceive of setting up such a structure, re- gardless of the opponent, shows that Nimzo- witsch had freed himself of 'the dead dogmas', a phrase that he used in his introduction to this very game. Why is a move like 7 g4 so offen- sive to classical sensibilities? a) It is the fifth pawn move out of the seven moves that White has made. b) It launches a flank advance when White has barely begun to develop his pieces. c) It has no apparent connection to the fight for the centre, much less for the crucial d4- square that White surrendered on the fourth move. d) It attacks nothing and defends nothing. e) It advances a pawn in front of White's king, assuming that he castles kingsidc (which he docs). What then could justify 7 g4? First, some concrete and pragmatic considerations; a) White's king's bishop is better placed on g2 than e2. b) The g4-pawn supports a potential f5, cramping Black, while discouraging Black's thematic thrust ".f5. c) While in general moving pawns in front of one's king can expose it to attack, that is sim- ply not a real concern in this particular position. But beyond all that, 7 g4 grabs space, just as the ubiquitous early flank advances that we saw in Chapter 2 did That tends to restrict the opponent's options for development, and what Nimzowitsch called "'the collective mobility" of White's pawns gives him certain attacking chances. Is 7 g4 therefore an unusually strong move? Probably not, but it is a playable one and, more significantly, a thinkable one. 7_e6 8Ag2 Qge7(D) A standard set-up that we often see today. Black has various good ideas in store such as ...d5 and ...f5. Copenhagen international event in which Olson didn't play (Nimzowitsch won with 972 points out of 10!), In fact. Nimzowitsch-Olson is by no means a great game. Nimzowitsch's play is delightful but hardly rigorously correct, and his opponent fails to put up any resistance at the end. But it is undeniably a modern game in ev- ery sense of that word, as much so today as in
1924. White plays a thoroughly experimental
opening, launches an extraordinarily early flank attack, creates a giant hole in his centre just begging for occupation by his opponent, and defies numerous conventional principles of development! Lastly, with a positional pawn sacrifice based upon a surprising retreat, he demonstrates a dynamic philosophy that would do a player of any era proud*

An unusual and already rather brash move, since it leaves a permanent hole on d4 that pro- vides an outpost for Black's pieces.
