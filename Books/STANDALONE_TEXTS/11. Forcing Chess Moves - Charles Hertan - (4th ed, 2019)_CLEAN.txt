Forcing Chess Moves WINNER of the ChessCafe 2008 Book of the Year Award SHORTLISTED for The Guardian 2008 Chess Book of the Year Award "All my students who worked with the book have increased their tactical level and rating by learning Hertan's method." GM Pontus Carlsson "By organizing and explaining the nature of great chess moves Hertan has brought us all closer to being able to find them." Former US Champion Joel Benjamin "This weighty tome is all about improving your tactical play." British Chess Magazine "Hertan develops the reader's skills methodically, thus enabling each tactical lesson to be learned and absorbed properly." Marsh Towers Chess Reviews "Entertaining and instructive (..) you simply cannot stop looking." Erik Bouwmans, Schaaknieuws "I love this book." Elisabeth Vicary, US Chess Federation Online "An intensive training course for advanced players to improve their tactical vision and calculation (..) You will increase your tactical striking powers a lot." Erik Rausch, Rochade Europa "When I remind my students to look for forcing moves, I often say: 'look at all checks and captures'. Forcing Chess Moves explains eloquently that this advice is along the right lines but distorted because finding the most forcing move is not always as simple as checking out ♕ xh7+. Sometimes the most forcing move is not a capture or a check, but a surprising way to make a threat - even a quiet move." Former US Women's Champion Jennifer Shahade "We're big fans of this book." Danny King & Ronan Bennet, The Guardian "Thrilling, instructive and witty. Right on target." Cor Jansen, Provinciaalse Zeeuwse Courant "A super book." Carl Portman, FOCUS Magazine "Develops creative, little explored ideas about how to improve your tactical vision (..) with outstanding positions from master practice." Mark Weeks, About.com "The price is low for a volume with so many pages and so much content." Stephen Dann, Worcester Telegram & Gazette "A superior combination book." John Donaldson, Jeremy Silman.com "This book deserves the highest of recommendations." Chess Horizons "Complete and enjoyable." Torre & Cavallo Magazine "A book that can improve your tactical skills in no time." Elburg Chess Reviews "One thing I've found in analyzing my own games is that Fritz will find moves that are clearly strong, but I would never have considered the first move of a sequence. Sometimes the tactic will defy categorization as a fork, skewer, deflection, removal of guard, etc, but simply be a move that works. My impression is that Hertan's book may help open the reader's eyes to these opportunities." Secrets of Grandpatzers Chess "The categories in this book are quite unusual (..) This work is an ample and accurate collection of startling problems bulging with combinative surprises." Harold Dondis, The Boston Globe "When the clock is ticking away, and you have too many viable candidate moves to choose from, remember Hertan's advice!"

Now, after having used it for years, also with my chess students, I would go as far as to say that it is a must-read for all club players who want to improve their chess. What I really like about the book is that it teaches my students a method of how to think, to discover tactics and creative ideas during a game. All of them now know that they should calculate the forced moves first, since if they win, they win! And there is nothing your opponent can do to stop it. All my students who worked with the book have increased their tactical level and ratings by learning Hertan's method (always look out for forcing moves, checks, captures & threats). Thus, I know that it works! I am pleased to see that Charles has worked hard to include some new fresh material where he digs deeper into the very interesting and modern topic of how we as humans can improve our game by learning from the computer. We need to realize that the time when we could make fun of the computer's lack of chess understanding is gone, and instead try to study how they sacrifice material for initiative, how they think, and how they evaluate positions. For this purpose, this book is a great start, so just enjoy it! And my sincere congratulations to Charles Hertan for creating another masterpiece. Please allow me to add one example of my own to prove that I have learned something from the book as well. Carlsson-Lindberg Sweden tt 2009

GM Pontus Carlsson Eskilstuna, Sweden www.pontus-carlsson.com July 2019 Preface to the 4th edition Shortly after Bobby Fischer obliterated four super-GM's to become the 11th World Champion, ex-champ Tigran Petrosian was interviewed by Chess Life magazine. 'What can we (Americans) learn from the Soviet School of Chess?', he was asked. Chess players are truth-seekers by nature, so perhaps his candid, objective answer shouldn't come as a surprise: 'You have the champion; now we must learn from you!' There's no denying that today's computers rule the landscape of chess knowledge, and we must learn from them now. Stockfish, the highest rated commercially available computer, is currently rated
3564. But in a match with AlphaZero this year Stockfish 8 lost by the
astounding score 155 to 6, with 838 draws. Since every 100 Elo points represent roughly one rating class, we can speculate that AlphaZero is about 3-4 rating classes above Stockfish, or roughly 3900 strength. World Champion Magnus Carlsen carries the highest human Elo rating ever, 2861 as of May 2019. This puts AlphaZero roughly 10 rating classes above Magnus. AZ is to Magnus, as Magnus is to a strong local club player rated 1850! We can only stare in awe at computer games that seem to come from a distant galaxy. One online observer commented, 'is this what 4000 chess looks like?' LCZero v20.2-32930 - Stockfish 190203 match, 2019

Computers have definitely influenced master play a great deal. Part of this book's lasting success may stem from being the first tactics book to directly address this reality. Chess moves like the following would have been considered almost unprecedented 50 years ago: Fedoseev-Malakhov St Petersburg 2017 Black aimed for this position so he could uncork the preposterous 1... ♕ xh5! with excellent practical chances. The engine calls it equal, but machines are not the arbiters of human emotion. White could not withstand the shock and went down quickly. There is no doubt that training with computers, and seeing games such as the following, inspired Black to consider such a 'random' resource: Miles-Deep Thought Long Beach 1989 Being a happy, well-fed computer, Black chose this mess because he 'saw' the road to a clear advantage with the absurd-looking move
1... ♗ xh2!! .
Bobby Fischer foreshadowed the computer era with his unbiased philosophy, 'I believe in strong moves'. Before him, players generally either disdained chaotic positions, or pursued them avidly. Fischer adopted the infamous Najdorf Poisoned Pawn Sicilian, where Black lives on a knife's edge, precisely because its random nature provided such fertile ground for outcalculating the opponent. He was not a risk-taker like Tal, but he believed that his unmatched preparation and objectivity made it worthwhile to wade into these waters, and try to pull out some coveted black wins: Bilek-Fischer Stockholm izt 1962

White plays an imperceptible inaccuracy, and in computerland the game is over! After the correct 16.♕ h5!, the engine vindicates Bobby's preparation: 16...fxe6 17.♘ xe6 ♕ xc3 18.♘ xf8 ♘ xf8
19.♕ f7+ ♔ h8 20.♕ xf8 ♘ c6 and chances are equal, but even
here Fischer would have the imbalance he sought. One of the computer's leading ideas is 21.e6, sacking the e-pawn for initiative (21...♕ e3+), a move so mystical that few humans would ever contemplate it...

♖ f8 ♕ xa2 27. ♖ f3 ♔ h7 0-1 Garry Kasparov took a page out of Fischer's book, daring white players to attack his Scheveningen Sicilian, and confront his gargantuan preparation and tactical genius. But I have elsewhere referred to Magnus Carlsen as the first true champion of the Computer Era. Growing up when computers were already established as indispensable training partners, Carlsen fully grasped the new landscape of 'engine trained human' competition, and used it to maximal practical advantage. Magnus is quite possibly the strongest, and surely the most versatile champion of all time. The 'computer eyes' concept espoused in this book is all about versatility. A computer couldn't care less whether it mates you with a brilliant combination, grinds you down in a slightly better ending, or refutes your blistering attack. Carlsen is the first player equally adept at smashing super-GM's in the style of Alekhine, or grinding them down with an impossibly tiny (or even nonexistent) endgame advantage, a la Capablanca. Computers disprove Capa's assertion that chess would soon suffer 'death by draws', due to the advancing level of grandmaster technique. Pit Alpha Zero against a 2700 grandmaster in a completely level ending with reasonable play left, and the GM will be embarrassed more often than not. Magnus recognized early on that he could do the same. His engine-like technique is so good, that the word 'technique' doesn't even quite describe it. The chess term 'technical ending' traditionally means that one side has a recognizable, concrete advantage, albeit very small, and he or she applies correct endgame principles, alongside masterful calculation and theoretical knowledge, to nurse the edge to victory. But Magnus regularly beats top players without any traditionally recognizable advantage. His unique 'computer eyes' delve so deeply into the positional and tactical potentialities of each distinct ending, that, like Stockfish, his ideas sometimes seem to come from another planet... Meier-Carlsen Karlsruhe/Baden-Baden 2019 If Carlsen were White here, we'd probably love his chances. White has a clever plan to win the a-pawn and create connected passers, while Black's play is like a distant beacon. In a genius feat of assessment the champ says 'Bring it on!'
1...d5! 2. ♘ c6 ♖ e8
The a-pawn is doomed by the fork trick 2...♖ c8?? 3.♘ e7+, but MC is cool as a cucumber.

Remarkably, it transpires that White has big problems mobilizing his queenside, while Black's central play unfolds naturally.
9. ♕ b2 d4 10.e3?!

Vintage Magnus - sacrificing the passer to set up a mating net with a quiet forcing move!! As if defending against basketball legend Michael Jordan, I imagine his dazed opponent staring wide eyed at the board, mouthing the words 'just... too... good'.
37. ♔ xd2 ♕ e4 0-1 White is paralyzed against the discovery, e.g. 38.♕
a6 ♘ b3# ! With his superhuman 'übertechnical' gift, Magnus realized he could throw a Soviet School style scientific opening repertoire out the window. He chose white opening moves so insipid and drawish, they were impossible to prepare for in any traditional sense. Unlike any player of the modern era, he rode this style to the crown. Perhaps this became too predictable or tedious, because just when we thought we had him pegged, the champ shook the chess world again! Preparing to defend his title for the third time, this time against Fabiano Caruana, he adopted the sharpest, most 'antipositional' mainstream opening in chess annals, the Sveshnikov Sicilian - and played it like the ultimate virtuoso! Perhaps this shouldn't have shocked us so much, because MC had always shown that when so inclined, he could also attack as well as anyone: Carlsen-Nakamura Wijk aan Zee 2013
1. ♗ e6! ♖ xg5 2. ♕ xg5 fxe6 3.dxe6 1-0 in light of 3...♕ xc6 4.f7#.
Still, the gumption of playing a notorious line, which skirts the boundary of soundness, against perhaps the world's best natural positional player, proved to be a stroke of genius, and one of the biggest surprises in championship play: Caruana-Carlsen London Wch m 2018 (playoff) I must confess, while following the match on-line, my thumbnail evaluation of this position was 'White is winning'! He has a 'crushing' queenside majority with a c6 'thorn' and seems to dominate the light squares. 1...♕ f3? is easily rebuffed by 2.♕ d5. Computer eyes (and Magnus) see a completely different picture, and I could scarcely believe that White resigned five moves later! After Black's next two moves - a repositioning retreat and a quiet move of profound power - the light begins to dawn...
1... ♗ d8!! 2. ♘ d5
The most natural move on earth isn't the most accurate. The engines endorse a bail out move like 2.♗ g5 just to keep equality. If 2.♘ e4 ♗ c7 3.O-O ♘ e7 achieving ...d6-d5.
1...e4!
Fabiano now realizes he's been outprepared in this rapid-play tiebreaker, and panics. Due to his must-win match situation, he may have chosen to go down in a blaze, because White can't castle -
2.O-O ♘ e5 3.♕ b5 ♕ h3 or 2.♗ d4 ♕ f3 3.O-O? ♘ xh4, when Black
can force perpetual or try for more.
3.c7 ♗ xc7! 4. ♘ xc7 ♘ e5 5. ♘ d5 ♔ h7 0-1
As great as Magnus may be, this game bears all the hallmarks of computer preparation. The human mind simply isn't programmed to scan for random resources in doubtful-looking positions. But computers are now the ultimate arbiters deciding which opening positions are strong, playable, or dubious. Strong GM's paired with powerful engines make remarkable chess discoveries every day. I will leave you with one more curious anecdote: A funny thing happened while researching my 2015 NIC book Basic Chess Opening for Kids . The problem was showing the youngsters how to refute the rare old coffeehouse Riga Gambit variation of the Ruy:
1.e4 e5 2. ♘ f3 ♘ c6 3. ♗ b5 a6 4. ♗ a4 ♘ f6 5.O-O ♘ xe4 6.d4 exd4 7. ♖ e1 d5
8. ♘ xd4 ♗ d6!
The Riga Gambit. White's position is not some theoretical backwater, but rather the supposed refutation of the 'naive' capture 6...exd4. The Riga Gambit - a bust to the Ruy Lopez!?
9. ♘ xc6 ♗ xh2+
The point of black's audacious play is 10.♔ xh2 ♕ h4+ 11.♔ g1 ♕ xf2+ with a draw by perpetual. Surely, I thought, the tremendous engine Rybka 4 could easily demolish the main line 10. ♔ f1 ♕ h4 when Black usually plays down a piece for 2 pawns... hours later the verdict arrived: slight advantage to Black!! What?? While recovering from engine shock, I was reminded of Fischer's old article 'A Bust to the King's Gambit', written after being humiliated as Black by Boris Spassky. A better engine may yet rehabilitate White's historically strongest debut, but meanwhile what should I tell the children? Fortuitously, a novelty played by my old friend Bill Paschall resulted in a miniature 'computer eyes' brilliancy: Paschall-Strand Oslo 2006
1.e4 e5 2. ♘ f3 ♘ c6 3. ♗ b5 a6 4. ♗ a4 ♘ f6 5.O-O ♘ xe4 6.d4 exd4 7. ♖ e1 d5
8.c4!?
In the computer era, Bill did not want to challenge Mr. Strand and his engine , which had probably made the same discovery as mine! Is the Paschall Variation henceforth the main line of the Ruy Lopez?
8... ♗ e6? 9.cxd5 ♕ xd5 10. ♗ b3 ♕ f5 11. ♗ c2! d3 12. ♕ xd3 ♗ d5 13. ♘ c3

The reader is thus invited to embrace the computer era, and emulate the world's best in striving to take its lessons to heart. Prepare to delve deeply into the three realms of knowledge which, with hard work and practice, will lead to improved chess calculation. These are, in a nutshell: • Knowledge of 'stock' recurring master combinations; • Enhanced brute force calculation skills; and • Understanding and overcoming the 'human biases' that stand in the way of finding many winning tactics. Whether you are already a fan of FCM or a new reader, you will find dozens of stimulating new positions in this edition. We have also added the 'Hertan Hierarchy' in the back. First published in 2009 in the compendium The Chess Instructor , the Hierarchy provides a systematic practical approach to analyzing positions. Used as a tool to analyze master games (or your own), it is designed to cement into practice many of the dynamic thought processes expounded in Forcing Chess Moves , helping you expand your tactical horizons, and take your analytical abilities to the next level. Foreword by three-time US Champion Joel Benjamin The study of tactics holds a necessary place in the regimen of players of all levels. One can find explanation of fundamental tactical elements - pins, skewers, forks, etc. - in a host of books, but the process of finding the killer moves is still rather mysterious. Hertan's work calls to mind the underdog success story of Van Perlo's Endgame Tactics . The little-known Dutch correspondence grandmaster compiled positions for thirty years until he produced a masterpiece which took the English Chess Federation's Book of the Year honors in 2006. Hertan, a FIDE Master living near Boston, has spent a comparatively small but still impressive fourteen years researching, organizing, and codifying 650 tactical positions of all varieties. Like Van Perlo, Hertan has unearthed a multitude of positions appearing in print for the first time. I have a feeling that Hertan's opus, like Van Perlo's, will be warmly received. In my lectures I have occasionally explored the demands of solving complex problems at the chessboard. Hertan has done so here on a grander scale with the aid of the useful concept of 'computer eyes '. From my experience working at IBM on the Deep Blue team, I know that computers can find strong moves that humans overlook because they appear too outrageous to consider. It is a sign of the growth of computers that the term 'computer move', which once was assigned to an ugly and pitiful move, is now used to connote a strong but surprising move computers are better equipped to identify. But my own human travails suffice to bring Hertan's idea close to heart. In many of my games I have discovered astonishing moves and combinations that seemed (to me, if not the spectators) to fall out of the sky. Yet there is a thought process behind every great chess move, and by organizing and explaining the nature of these magic moves, Hertan has brought us all closer to being able to find them. Benjamin-Silman Lone Pine 1979 My opponent, one of the great American chess teachers and writers, no doubt looked forward to enjoying the bishop pair against his fifteen-year-old adversary. The tactical idea, utilizing a discovered attack and a zwischenzug, is fairly routine compared to the execution. I wanted to play 24.♘ f5, but the bishop would simply capture my knight and defend the rook on d7. The idea only works with the stunning 24. ♘ c8!! . After 24... ♖ xd1 25. ♘ xe7+ ♔ f7 26. ♖ xd1 ♔ xe7 27.g4! White went on to win an instructive (but beyond the scope of this book) ending. Silman had not registered that the knight could dare to enter a square so apparently off limits. The surprise square figured in another shocking move for me in the
1992 U.S. Championship. I have all my pieces converging on the e4-
pawn, but with my knight in the way White seems safe to continue his maneuvers: A.Ivanov-Benjamin Durango 1992 The startling 17... ♘ f3!! provided a big advantage. The main line runs
18.♕ xf3 ♗ xe4 19.♕ g3 ♗ d6 20.♖ xd6 ♕ xd6 21.f4 (21.♕ xd6
cxd6 22.♖ g1 ♗ xg2 23.♖ xg2 ♖ e1+ 24.♔ d2 ♖ xb1) and now I intended 21...♗ xg2 22.♕ xg2 ♕ xf4+ 23.♘ d2 ♖ e3 with a big initiative for Black, but the computer suggestion 21...♗ xc2!? 22.♔ xc2 ♖ e2+ 23.♔ c1 ♕ d5 is also strong. 18.♖ xd8+ ♖ xd8 19.♕ xf3 ♗ xe4 20.♕ g3 ♗ d6 21.f4 ♗ xg2 22.♕ xg2 ♗ xf4+ is even worse, so Ivanov tried 18.a3 ♗ d6 19. ♘ c3 ♗ xe4 20. ♘ xe4 ♕ xe4 21. ♕ xe4 ♖ xe4 22. ♖ d3 ♘ g5 and Black won on move 33. The defender can hardly be expected to catch a move like 17...♘ f3 in time. The attacker, with a vested interest in discovering such magic, may look deeper. Any 'safe' move by the knight allows the consolidating move 18.f3. I only noticed the move because I had been calculating sacrifices on f3 if White played f2-f3 at some point. Notice that with the pawn on f3, the knight sacrifice appears more plausible because it captures something, reducing the 'quietness' of the move. Benjamin-Friedman St Martin 1993 It seems that White can hardly win with the black d-pawn poised to queen. 48. ♖ xh7! is a good start because 48...d1♕ +? 49.♔ e7! forces mate. After 48... ♖ h5?? (48...♖ f7+ was necessary for the draw) 49. ♖ 3xh5 gxh5 50. ♖ h6!! is a killer quiet move. Black can queen with check, normally a real combination spoiler, but here that only encourages 51.♔ e7, tightening the net on Black's king. The game concluded 50... ♔ f7 51. ♖ f6+ ♔ g8 52. ♔ e7 ♔ h7 53. ♖ f7+ ♔ g6 54.f5+ exf5 55. ♖ f6+ ♔ g5 56. ♖ d6 1-0 . The final position I would like to share comes from the last round of the 1984 New York Open, a game I needed to win to obtain a good prize. Abramovic-Benjamin New York 1984 Though White doesn't have enough material for the queen, the awkward position of the black queen and the dangerous passed pawns complicate the winning process considerably. With very accurate play Black may consolidate, but I could not work it out over the board and felt frustrated. After a 45-minute think I had an inspiration.
1... ♗ xg2!! 2. ♔ xg2 e4 3.d6 ♕ f3+ 4. ♔ h2 ♗ g7 5. ♘ c6 ♕ e2+ 6. ♔ h1 e3 7.
♖ e7 (7.d7 ♕ e1+ 8.♔ h2 e2 9.♗ e3 h4!) 7... ♕ d1+ 8. ♔ g2 ♕ d5+ 9. ♔ f1 ♕ xb5+ 10. ♔ e1 ♕ xc6 11.d7 ♕ c1+ 0-1 We do not often have the luxury of using a 'brute force' approach favored by computers, but here I had been reduced to considering almost every possible move. Once I allowed my brain to contemplate
1...♗ xg2, the calculation was quite easy. With the bishop gone from
e4, the follow-up 2...e4! is a deadly 'quiet connector'. After that, the black queen completely dominates. I hope I have whetted your appetite for the smorgasbord of positions to follow. The beauty of Hertan's achievement lies in the quality of both the positions selected, and the analysis. While the examples of each 'computer eyes' theme will interest even the strongest master, they are explained and analyzed at a level which unlocks their mysteries for even the average club player. Beyond this, the text is liberally spiced with Hertan's pithy, and often humorous, commentary. Entertainment, and very likely enlightenment, awaits the reader. Introduction Old school tactics and combination books had three glaring limitations:
1. They gave great coverage of key stratagems like forks, pins,
and typical sacrifices, but failed to address the crucial question: 'How can I find these themes more consistently in my own games?'
2. They tended to rehash the same 'classic' tactical examples over
and over, for the obvious reason that it is far easier to draw from existing works, than to comb raw game scores for fresh illustrations.
3. Traditional combination books devoted almost all of their
attention to mating attacks, neglecting the simple 2-4 move material- winning forcing moves which occur far more frequently in practical play. This book takes a radically different approach, starting with the assumption that the reader is already familiar with basic tactical stratagems like pins and skewers (or can study them elsewhere) and focusing instead on the question: 'What prevents me from finding the winning forcing moves more often? ' While hard work and talent certainly play important roles, 40 years of teaching has shown me the central role of human bias in the failure to adequately consider key options. If we could shed our natural human thought tendencies and see the position through 'COMPUTER EYES ', these biases might fall away, enabling us to consider other options which may hold the truth to a given position. A terrific illustration of my thesis is the 'mate in two' composition, a genre which is specifically designed to confound human biases, as you'll discover if you become addicted to solving them as I have: Chernykh & Kopaev Mate in two moves After the key move 1. ♕ d7! , threatening 2.♕ xc6# (not 1.♕ f6?, threatening 2.c4#, which is 'cooked' by 2...♕ e5!), Black has nine defenses, each of which is met by a different mating move! While strong computers would solve this problem with ease, let's face it, it's quite a struggle for us humans to visualize lines such as 1... ♖ hxd6 2. ♘ f6# when the rook is pinned; 1... ♕ xd6 2. ♘ f4# and now the queen is pinned; 1... ♘ d4 2.c4# when the knight now seals the king's egress to d4; 1... ♘ e5 2. ♘ e7# when e5 is 'self-blocked'; or the 5 different mates resulting from each legal move of the c6-rook: 1... ♖ b6+ 2. ♔ xb6# ; 1... ♖ a6 2. ♔ xa6# ; 1... ♖ xc7+ 2. ♔ xc7# ; 1... ♖ xc5 2. ♘ b6# ; and finally, 1... ♖ cxd6 2. ♔ b8# . The rook is now pinned and can't block the bishop check. Erenburg-Banusz Budapest 2004 Moving to the realm of practice, how many readers can honestly say that they would even consider the following mind-blowing 'quiet' forcing move?
1. ♕ e6!! ♖ xf7 2. ♘ f5! ♔ h8
The main line is 2...♘ f4 3.♕ e8+ ♖ f8 4.♘ e7+, mating, and 2...♕ h8 3.♕ xg6, threatening 4.♘ h6+, is also utterly hopeless.
3. ♕ xf7 ♘ f4 4. ♘ e7 1-0 . A mating queen check follows.
Defining 'Forcing moves' Before we go further, it is very important that you understand precisely what I mean by the term 'forcing move'. Loosely defined terms lead to misconceptions and errors in thinking! So here it is: A forcing move is a move which limits the opponent's options by making a concrete threat, such as mate or win of material . Many players think only of checks, captures, or flashy sacrifices when they hear this term. While checks and captures do tend to be forcing, frequently they are far from the most forcing choices. Take, for instance, this position taken from a classic game between Mieses and Chigorin. Mieses-Chigorin (variation) Hanover 1902 There are many checks and captures, but no move more forcing than 1. ♗ e5! , threatening double discovered mate via 2.♖ b8# or
2.♖ c7+ ♔ b8 3.♖ c8#. Absolutely forced is 1... ♘ xe5 when 2. ♖
xa7+ ♔ b8 3. ♖ b7+ ♔ c8 4. ♘ b6# follows. The first step toward developing better calculation skills is to train yourself to always analyze the most forcing moves first. This is not because they are always best. The most forcing move may lose outright, and usually does! There are three compelling reasons why analyzing forcing moves first is necessary:
1. Forcing moves have the potential to transform the game, by
leading to gain of material, checkmate, or other concrete gains. When they do work, they tend to work better and quicker than non- forcing options.
2. Analyzing the most forcing moves first saves precious time. If
they work, there is no need to look any further! Countless winning positions have been squandered by players who wasted huge amounts of time examining obscure ideas, when a clearly decisive forcing move was available.
3. Forcing moves limit the opponent's options, and thereby reduce
the risk of calculation errors. Fewer replies to calculate means less chance of slipping up, so all things being equal, the most forcing option is simplest and best. A deep study of forcing moves is probably the single most important task toward achieving chess mastery, since doing so will do four wonderful things to improve your calculation skills:
1. Studying tactical positions promotes analytical precision. 'Close
enough' won't do. This is exactly what you must strive for, to find more winning forcing moves in your own practice. Precise analysis wins games.
2. Tactical study helps you develop BOARD SIGHT , the ability to
envision more clearly where all the pieces are, and what they are doing, at each step of every variation. This is not an issue for computers, who have the huge practical advantage of perfect board sight, no matter how far ahead they are 'thinking'.
3. Studying composed problems and master tactics helps you
overcome human bias and 'staleness' in your thinking. In problem solving, stereotyped, 'automatic' moves will get you nowhere fast!
4. Learning to relax and enjoy the slow process of discovering the
answer (rather than kicking yourself in frustration!) will help you develop the important capacity to enjoy the challenge of calculating difficult variations. Yes, this is a capacity you can develop! As a young player with a 'positional bent', I had to learn to do so myself, and it is a must if you are to develop your tactical potential. The first goal of any player aspiring to find more winning forcing moves in his/her games, should be to calculate two moves ahead with absolute precision. Two obstacles are false pride and shame! Somehow, players seem to believe that 'everyone else' can see two moves ahead with ease, and they're embarrassed to admit how difficult it may be for them. Most club players have a similar fallacy about opening preparation: they imagine that studying openings is the key to improvement, and that 'everyone else' knows their openings cold; while in reality 95% of club games are decided by who does a better job of calculating variations and avoiding blunders. Seeing two moves ahead, consistently, with accuracy and perfect board sight, is a very difficult task for a human, and probably a sufficient achievement to allow you to perform at the candidate master level tactically. My peak FIDE rating was over 2400, yet I am not ashamed to admit that some particularly devilish mate-in-two problems have stumped me for as long as an hour! Defining 'Computer eyes' When I use the term 'computer eyes' in this book, I have two skills in mind, which computers excel at, and which we must learn from in order to maximize our chance of finding the correct forcing moves. The first skill is brute force calculation, the ability to accurately analyze a series of forcing moves. The first two chapters are focused on helping you develop this skill, and it continues to be an important theme throughout the book. The second skill is objectivity, the ability to find critical forcing moves which we tend to overlook due to human bias. Developing this skill will be the primary focus of the remaining chapters. Bias varies from person to person; unlike computers, each of us has different blind spots, or types of moves that tend to elude us. The following encounter helped me bring this idea more into focus. Hertan-Kelleher Cambridge 1994 Black, one of New England's most feared attacking masters, lost quickly after 1... ♔ e4?? 2. ♗ g5! and the pawns crash through after
2...fxg5 3.♔ xg5 or 2...♔ d5 3.♔ h5 and 4.♗ h6.
More refined is the waiting move 1...♔ d4?!, but it transpires that White can still win by one tempo: 2.♔ h5 ♔ e4 3.♗ g5 ♔ xf5 4.♗ h6 ♗ h8 5.♗ f8! ♔ xf4 6.♔ h6 f5 7.♗ g7 ♗ xg7+ 8.♔ xg7 ♔ e3
9.♔ h7 f4 10.g7 f3 11.g8♕ f2 12.♕ c4.
So is Black lost? Well, no. It turns out that there is a miracle draw:
1... ♔ d6!! 2. ♔ h5 ♔ e7 3. ♗ g5 fxg5 4.fxg5 ♔ f8! 5.f6 ♔ g8!!
The shocking point: on 6.fxg7, 6...♔ xg7 wins the g6-pawn with a book draw.
6. ♔ g4 ♗ f8 7. ♔ f5 ♗ b4
And White can't break the blockade, since 8.g7 ♔ f7 9.g6+ ♔ g8 10. ♔ e6 ♗ a3 leads nowhere. What struck me about this game was not Black's failure to find these variations, which were after all so deep that few GM's would foresee them, but rather Kelleher's candid admission afterwards: 'I would never consider the move 1...♔ d6; it's too passive.' While a computer would have used brute force calculation to find the draw, a strong master had failed to even consider the strongest forcing move due to human bias! If this was true for Kelleher, how much more true must it be for the average club player! In the pages of this book, you will find hundreds of opportunities to understand, and move beyond, typical human bias. Once you have digested these positions carefully, your newfound 'computer eyes' will help you discover many winning forcing moves which might have escaped your consideration in the past. How to use this book To get the most from this book, I would recommend the following approach: the first time through, play through every variation of each example until you feel that you understand it perfectly. While the positions are selected to be challenging and stimulating even to masters, the variations are analyzed and explained at a level that club players should be able to follow. By completely understanding each solution, you will develop your 'computer eyes', by seeing how the type of 'human bias' covered in each chapter occurs in practice, and learning to develop an eye for the types of forcing moves you tend to overlook. If you are absolutely stumped by a position even after playing through all the lines, put it aside for awhile and try to come back to it with a fresh head (my preferred method for solving difficult compositions). Save your 'solving' skills for the illustrative exercises at the end of each chapter. In order to simplify the presentation of the text, I have chosen to use the convention '1-0 ' or '0-1 ', to signify that White or Black obtains a winning advantage at the end of each fragment. To maximize comprehension, the main line given in the solution represents the clearest or most thematically important demonstration of the winning forcing move, not necessarily the game continuation. A white square accompanying a diagram indicates that White is to move; and a dark square means that Black is to move. To distinguish the examples in the 'Study material' part of every chapter from the 'Exercises' part, I have provided the numbers of the former with the prefix 'FCM' (i.e. 'Forcing Chess Moves') and those of the latter with the prefix 'Ex'.
CHAPTER 1
Stock forcing moves Study material Beginners typically start their tactical education with basic stratagems like fork, pin, and skewer. With further study, they encounter standard combinations like the classical bishop sacrifice, double bishop sacrifice, and Philidor's ('Smothered') Mate, which can and should be studied in any good basic tactics book (I recommend the classic Art of the Checkmate by Renaud and Kahn). Later, as players gain some experience and absorb a large number of master games, a variety of 'stock' themes, or typical winning sacrifices, become familiar. In this first chapter, we look at typical stock tactics with the rook, knight, bishop and queen. Chapter 2 examines winning stock attacks against vulnerable squares around the enemy king. By helping you to better understand these crucial weapons in the master arsenal, these two chapters introduce you to the power of FORCING MOVES . By focusing on the role of BRUTE FORCE CALCULATION and UNEXPECTED MOVES in implementing these sacrifices, we also begin the process of honing your COMPUTER EYES . Strong masters develop a 'radar' for these recurring types of combinations through study and experience, which helps them to quickly find the right continuation in the heat of battle. As you absorb the stock forcing moves used by the pros, and learn to apply them in your own games, you will gradually sharpen your own instincts. We are talking about stock mates and sacrifices involving the rook, knight, bishop and queen. But what about the king and pawn, you may ask? Does the author neglect the contributions of these noble pieces? Well, the king is a very fine attacker, especially in the endgame; but he cannot effectively sacrifice himself... so sorry, I cannot recall any important stock positions starring the monarch. As for the pawn, it generally plays a supporting role in the stock motifs of other pieces, except for the special case of PROMOTION , which is so important that we will examine it deeply in the context of later chapters. A) Stock mating patterns involving the rook Back rank themes This is the first stock mating pattern that most players discover, yet it remains highly important at all levels, recurring in many creative and disguised forms, in analysis and actual play.
FCM 1.1
Belov-Osachuk Soviet Union 1965
1. ♕ f8+! ♔ xf8
1...♔ g6 2.♕ h6#.
2. ♗ h6+ ♔ g8 3. ♖ e8# .
Computer eyes can help you find this pretty combination in a heartbeat. The queen sacrifice is shocking, but it is also the MOST FORCING MOVE on the board (allowing just two legal responses), which you will already recognize from the Introduction as the move which must be looked at first! Here is a fancier version of the same idea:
FCM 1.2
Netto-Abente Paraguay 1983 Two major pieces are a small price to pay, to have the bishop land on h3 with check:
1... ♖ e1+ 2. ♔ g2 ♖ g1+!! 3. ♔ xg1 ♕ e1+ 4. ♔ g2 ♕ f1+! 5. ♔ xf1 ♗ h3+ 6.
♔ g1 ♖ e1# . Again, the most forcing options held the key, and there was no need to look any further! Most often the bishop on h6 does not appear by means of a flashy sacrifice; scores of back rank ideas are based on the presence of a bishop or pawn on f6 or h6, blocking the king's g7 escape hatch:
FCM 1.3
Radevich-Donskikh Soviet Union 1972 The stock shot 1.f7+! , mating on f8 after either 1...♗ xf7 2.♖ a8+ or
1...♔ xf7 2.♖ f1+ ♔ g8 3.♖ f8#, is not a trivial tactic to foresee,
without having developed one's computer eyes. But perhaps you already discovered this beautiful move on your own, if you are a quick learner and already in the habit of analyzing the most forcing move first! A queen on h6 is an especially dangerous guardian of the g7 escape square, since the defender must also worry about incursions on f8, f6 or h7:
FCM 1.4
Oll-Cvitan Eupen (rapid) 1995
1. ♖ d7!
Not the most forcing option (that honor would belong to 1.♕ f8+,
1.♕ g7+, or 1.♖ d8+), but the only one that wins! Remember our
introductory discussion: the most forcing move usually loses, but is still the one which must be looked at first. If you still doubt this, reread the last few pages! The black queen falls, since 1... ♕ e8 (to prevent 2.♕ f8#) is met by 2. ♕ f6+ ♔ g8 3. ♖ d8 1-0 .
FCM 1.5
Karasev-Klaman Leningrad 1967 White exploits Black's back rank woes creatively to set up a mating attack:
1. ♖ e6! ♕ d8
Again, the queen must guard against 2.♕ xf8#.
2. ♖ g6!
Did you overlook this forcing move because it looks impossible? Chapter 4, on SURPRISE FORCING MOVES , will help you overcome this bias!
2... ♖ g8 3. ♖ xf7
The attack shifts from g7 to the sitting duck on h7.
3... ♖ d1+ 4. ♔ h2 ♕ b8+ 5.g3 1-0 The white king walks toward the rook.
A bishop (or other piece) blocking the king's escape hatch at h7 can have the same effect of creating a back rank liability for the defender:
FCM 1.6
Topalov-Morozevich Cannes 2002
1. ♗ e4!! A fantastic feat of computer eyes! Yes, attacking all three
black pieces is very forcing, but since you are not a computer or world champion, you probably need to work on your SELECTION skills to even consider such a surprise forcing move!
1... ♖ xb5
There is no escape, e.g. 1...♘ xf2+ 2.♔ g2 ♖ ee8 3.♖ xb8 ♖ xb8
4.♔ xf2.
2. ♖ a8+! 1-0
Here is a different type of stock back rank theme, in which the king is first 'kidnapped' into mating position:
FCM 1.7
Askelof-Svensson correspondence game, 1983
1... ♖ e1+! 2. ♖ xe1 ♕ g1+!
A winning ZWISCHENZUG or 'in-between forcing move', a tactic we will explore much more deeply in Chapter 8.
3. ♔ xg1 ♖ xe1# .
Take note: all of Black's moves were surprising and beautiful, but also 100% forcing, and thus among the first options needing to be considered. In case you still have any doubt that studying stock tactics will win you more games, check out a more recent example. Championship contender Aronian probably wished he'd packed a copy of FCM in his travel bag after this debacle:
FCM 1.8
Aronian-Van Wely Wijk aan Zee 2014 The wily Dutchman was no doubt ready to stop the clocks after 1.♕ xe6 or 1.♘ g5+, when his last prayer was answered by 1.exf4?? ♗ d4+! and it was Aronian who had to concede in view of 2.cxd4 ♕ b1+
3.♗ e1 ♕ xe1+.
FCM 1.9
Morozevich-Bologan Sochi 2004 Having fewer escape options, a king in the corner is even more subject to 'kidnapping':
1. ♕ h8+! ♔ xh8 2. ♖ xf8+ ♘ g8 3. ♗ e5+ 1-0
A SENSITIVE BACK RANK calls for heightened creative alertness to the endless array of 'surprise tactics':
FCM 1.10
Ashley-Kortchnoi San Francisco 1995 If eyes could smell, computer eyes would smell blood here! Black is very active and White's back rank is vulnerable. Soon even the ♖ h4 will join the fray!
1... ♘ d2!
Exploiting the 'interference theme' 2.♖ xd2 ♕ c1+!.
2.b3
The white queen is overloaded after 2.♕ xd2 ♖ xd4! and he will have to give his rook on h1 after 2.♗ d3 ♕ c1+! 3.♗ b1 ♖ xd4!, but now mate comes on the a-file!
2... ♘ xb3+! 3.axb3 ♖ c5! 0-1
4.♖ xb4 ♖ a5+ etc.
FCM 1.11
Kharlov-Franco Ocampos Zaragoza 1994 A forking move is justified by deadly back-rank pins:
1.b4! ♗ xb4
On 1...♕ xb4, the skewer 2.♗ c3! exploits the d-file pin.
2. ♕ xc8! 1-0
Crushing is 2...♖ xc8 3.♖ xc8+ ♗ f8 4.♗ a3! with too much wood for the queen. In master play, a strong secondary threat, such as a knight fork or a mating idea, usually works together with back rank motifs:
FCM 1.12
Larsen-Ljubojevic Milan 1975
1... ♕ h4!
A prime forcing option which must be examined even though it 'drops material'. Before rejecting such a move you must always try to look one move deeper, for the most forcing follow-up - often your opponent won't!
2. ♕ xe5
The gift must be accepted; if 2.h3 ♕ xh3+ 3.♔ g1 ♗ h2+ 4.♔ f2 (4.♔ h1 ♗ g3+) 4...♕ g3#. But now White has too many problems on g2 and the back row.
2... ♕ f2! 0-1 On 3.♖ g1 ♕ xg2+! 4.♖ xg2 ♖ c1 mates.
Computer eyes must begin with looking out for this crucial stock pattern - the 'diversion sacrifice' which draws off a key back rank defender.
FCM 1.13
Rada-Kostal Prague 1942 White sets up a 'CROSS-PIN ' of the black queen, to attack both g7 and the back rank:
1. ♖ xb2! ♖ xb2 2. ♕ d4 ♕ e5
Black foresaw White's sacrifice and prepared this seemingly tight defense. White contemplated the vulnerable back rank and looked one forcing move deeper:
3. ♖ e1! 1-0 The queen is diverted from one of the mating squares g7
or e8. DIVERSION SACRIFICES may also occur when a piece must guard another unit, as well as the back rank:
FCM 1.14
Anand-Hou Yifan Wijk aan Zee 2018 White's only meaningful advantage here is the advanced passed pawn, but this example illustrates well why this is often enough. Even when the pawn seems contained, it controls key squares in the enemy camp, which White exploits to perfection with a crucial stock back rank diversion trick: 1. ♖ d7! when 1...♕ xc6? allows 2.♖ d8+!, winning the queen. White exploited the back rank motif again after
1... ♕ a5 with 2.c7! (2...♖ xc7 3.♖ d8#), and now the passer was
simply too strong after 2... ♖ f8 3. ♕ e7 , threatening 4.♕ xf8+ or 4.♖ d8: 1-0 .
FCM 1.15
Mieses-Reshevsky Margate 1935 After correctly trying the very forcing start 1... ♗ xd4 2.cxd4 , alert computer eyes are drawn to the stock diversion tactic 2...♕ xd4 3.♕ xc4 ♖ e1+, but White can safely escape with 4.♔ g2. Reshevsky did not give up on the idea, but found a stronger forcing second move:
2... ♖ e4! Winning the d-pawn, or the queen after 3. ♕ xc4? ♖ e1+! 0-1 .
We will train your computer eyes to be alert for such 'QUIET FORCING MOVES ' in Chapter 6. Even seasoned computer eyes can be fooled by well-concealed back rank themes:
FCM 1.16
Kamsky-Nunn Monaco blindfold 1995 White's plan to 'safely simplify' with 1.♘ g5 invited the electrifying 1... ♕ xd5!! with an assisted back rank mate in the main line 2.♕ xd5 ♖ a1+ 3.♖ e1 ♗ xd3+ 4.♔ g1 ♖ xe1#!. It's a crying shame that after 2. ♕ c2 Black playing blindfold induced the fingerfehler 2...♕ xb5??
3.♗ xb5+-, when surely the tactical whiz Dr. Nunn 'saw' the winning
point 2... ♖ a1+! 3. ♖ e1 and only now 3... ♕ xb5!! . The 'cross-pinned' ♗ d3 costs White the game after 4.♖ xa1 ♗ xd3+ or 4. ♗ xb5 ♖ xe1+ 5. ♔ xe1 ♗ xc2 , 0-1 . A string of dazzling and creative forcing moves also underlies the following brilliancy utilizing back rank themes. Brute force calculation of several difficult variations required high level computer eyes, helped by quick recognition of additional stock ideas; the idea of a forking check on f7, and the pin of the g7-pawn by the ♗ b2:
FCM 1.17
Gheorghiu-Kinnmark The Hague 1961
1. ♖ xd6!! ♕ xd6
Black's king is completely naked after 1...♗ xf5 2.♖ xh6+! gxh6 3.♘ xf7+ ♔ g8 4.♘ xh6+ ♔ h7 5.♘ xf5.
2. ♘ xf7+! ♖ xf7 3. ♖ e8+ ♖ f8
Hopeless is 3...♕ f8 4.♖ xf8+ ♖ xf8 5.♕ d2! ♔ g8 6.♕ d4.
4. ♕ d2!!
Another great diversion tactic, with a second threat against h6.
4... ♕ xd2
4...♗ xf5 5.♕ xd6 ♖ axe8 6.♕ xh6+ also mates.
5. ♖ xf8# A fine feat of calculation and BOARD SIGHT .
Marauding majors Close cousins to back rank themes are positions where a queen teams up with the rooks to infiltrate enemy lines. Masters are keenly aware that once two or more major pieces invade the 7th and 8th ranks, the odds are high that a winning tactic will appear, especially if the king's nest is even slightly compromised:
FCM 1.18
Xiong-So St Louis ch-USA 2017 The far from obvious 1... ♖ d8! seals White's fate on the back rank after 2.♖ xd2 ♖ 8xd2 or even 2.♖ e1 ♕ xe1+! and 3...♖ 8d2; 0-1 .
FCM 1.19
Anand-Adams London 2012 White's king haven seems solid, but computer eyes spot a hidden vulnerability: 1... ♕ d1! 2. ♕ h6 The venerable champ goes down swinging since 2.♗ xe6 ♖ a1! 3.♗ xf7+ ♔ g7 leads to a quick stock mate, while even 2.♗ f1 meets with the game retort: 2... ♗ h3+! and mate, 0-1 .
FCM 1.20
Anand-Caruana Wijk aan Zee 2013 A ♕ +♖ battery on the 8th presents so much firepower that even a well-sheltered king is endangered, though computers caution us not to assume a win:
1. ♖ h8+ ♔ g6 2. ♕ g8
The forcing threat 3.♖ xh6+ gives the needed impetus to White's attack.
2... ♔ f6 3. ♖ h7
The royal fortress can't withstand the siege, and starts to crumble.
3... ♔ e7 4. ♕ xg7 ♕ h5 5. ♗ g5+ ♔ d7 6. ♕ xf7+ 1-0 (6...♕ xf7 7.♖ xf7+
♔ e8 7.♖ f6)
FCM 1.21
Vidit-Kramnik Wijk aan Zee 2019 Black's last hope is 1.♕ f2?? ♖ a1+ 2.♔ h2 ♕ xe5+, but the marauding majors break through to the 8th rank via 1. ♕ f4! , with the simple lines 1...♘ xf4 2.♖ f8# or 1...h6 2.♖ f8+ ♘ xf8 3.♕ xf8+ ♔ h7 4.♕ g8#: 1-O .
FCM 1.22
Solozhenkina-Horvath Gibraltar 2019 When the defender's rook is barricaded in the corner, a back rank rook generates crippling pins which often immobilize the enemy queenside. This theme informed a winning shot:
1... ♗ f3! 2. ♕ xf3
Worse is 2.♗ xf3 ♕ xf1+ 3.♔ h2 ♕ xf2+ and mate on g3.
2... ♖ xf1+! 3. ♔ h2 ♕ xf3 4. ♗ xf3 ♗ a3! 5. ♗ xa3 White had probably
intended 5.♗ b2? but that fails to 5...♖ xf2+, winning a whole bishop.
5... ♖ xa1 0-1
Corridor Mate Typically a rook+knight duet, this common mating pattern is rather like a 'back rank mate turned sideways'.
FCM 1.23
Gygli-Henneberger Zürich 1941 Computer eyes string together four 100% forcing moves, hitting the jackpot:
1... ♘ e2+ 2. ♔ h1 ♕ xg4! 3.hxg4 ♖ h5+ 4.gxh5 ♖ h4#
the 'Corridor Mate'
FCM 1.24
Toth-Szigeti Budapest 1946 Computer eyes found a sneaky IN-BETWEEN CHECK (Chapter 8) to implement the classic corridor mate position (knight on e7, rook on the h-file):
1. ♘ f5! ♕ xh5 2. ♘ e7+! ♔ h7 3. ♖ xh5#
Here is a more complicated and brilliant version: grandmasterly computer eyes found a beautiful QUIET FORCING MOVE (Chapter 6) making use of the corridor mate idea:
FCM 1.19
Akopian-Kramnik Wijk aan Zee 2004
1. ♖ h7! ♔ xh7
The king is lured onto the h-file corridor and will not come out alive. In the game Black resigned after 1...♕ xb2+ (or 1...♗ f8 2.♖ dh1)
2.♕ xb2 ♘ xb2 3.♖ xg7+ ♔ f8 4.♖ h1!.
2. ♘ xe7+ ♔ h6 3. ♖ h1+ ♗ h5 4.g4 ♗ h8 5. ♖ xh5+ ♔ g7 6. ♕ xf6#
In this unusual example, White executed the stock motif a bit further up the board, to convert a winning endgame:
FCM 1.26
Praggnanandhaa-Ragnarsson Douglas 2018
1. ♘ e6! carried an even more lethal threat than snapping the d-pawn
- 1...d3 2. ♖ xh6+! when 2... ♔ xh6 (2...♔ g8 3.♖ g1+ with mate in 2)
3. ♖ h1# is a corridor mate.
We turn now to stock mating ideas involving a PAIR OF ROOKS attacking on the SEVENTH AND/OR EIGHTH RANKS , an important and special subtype of 'marauding majors':
FCM 1.27
Thomas-Marshall Hamburg 1930 On 1.♖ xf7? the legendary American attacker had prepared the defense 1...♕ xf1+! 2.♕ xf1 ♖ xf7, but down rained the stock double-rook blow 1. ♕ xf7+! ♖ xf7 2. ♖ c8+ ♖ f8 3. ♖ c/fxf8# ! An amazing slip, but average players can take heart: even the best tacticians may forget to examine the most forcing move first ! Like glasses, computer eyes only work when you remember to put them on! In the most common double-rook stock mate, the rooks deliver mate on g7 and h7 (g2/h2) while an enemy piece on f8 (f1) blocks the king's escape.
FCM 1.28
Bannik-Cherepkov Soviet Union 1961
3... ♖ e2!! 4. ♕ xc5 Or 4.♖ xg5 ♕ xg5+. 4... ♖ gxg2+ 5. ♔ h1 ♖ h2+ 6.
♔ g1 ♖ eg2# stock double rook mate
FCM 1.29
NN-Keene simul 1995 In the preceding (usual) case, White's rook on f1 enabled the stock mate by blocking the king's escape. In some instances, an extra attacker may do the job just as well:
1... ♕ h2+!!
Perhaps such moves seem like 'grandmaster magic' but - need I remind you? - it is the most forcing move on the board. Perhaps your computer eyes are even able to follow the chain of forcing moves and find the tricky but logical 'quiet forcing move' on move 4?
2. ♔ xh2 ♖ xf2+ 3. ♔ h1 ♘ g3+ 4. ♔ g1 ♖ ee2! 0-1 There is no defense
against the slightly modified double rook mate 5...♖ g2#. Two rooks on the eighth rank may deliver mate when the king lacks flight squares to escape their checks:
FCM 1.30
Alekhine-Colle Paris 1925
1. ♕ xd7! ♖ xd7 2. ♖ e8+ ♔ h7 3. ♖ cc8 ♖ d8
3...♔ h6 4.♖ h8#.
4. ♖ exd8 1-0
Here is a related case, where the black queen again impedes her own king's escape to g5:
FCM 1.31
Kamsky-Leveille Buffalo 1989
1. ♖ xf7! ♕ xg5 2. ♖ f8+ ♔ g7 3. ♖ 1f7+ ♔ h6 4. ♖ h8#
Even a king in the middle occasionally falls prey to the dreaded double rook mate:
FCM 1.32
Atakisi-Ruck Istanbul 2003
1. ♕ xf7+! ♖ xf7 2. ♖ h8+ 1-0
Master calculation and board sight are most needed when the stock pattern is embedded deep in a long chain of forcing moves:
FCM 1.33
Lanka-Szelag Rostock 2002
1. ♗ xf7+! ♖ xf7 2. ♕ h7+ ♔ f8 3. ♘ e6+ ♔ e8
3...♔ e7 4.♖ xf7+ ♔ xf7 5.♖ f1+ loses a piece.
4. ♕ g8+ ♗ f8
Black can play for a prayer on 5.♘ xc7+ ♔ d8, threatening a perpetual, but the real point is:
5. ♕ xf8+! ♖ xf8 6. ♖ xf8+ ♔ e7 7. ♖ h7+ 1-0 .
B) Stock forcing moves by the knight Now that we've had some fun with rooks, helping your computer eyes recognize their tricks, we turn our attention to that mischievous and unique piece, the mighty 'Springer'! An extremely common and important motif is the stock sacrifice forcing a winning knight fork:
FCM 1.34
Nakamura-Vachier-Lagrave London 2018 Any hope Black has left after 1. ♘ xf7 ♕ xh3 is dashed by the stock trick 2. ♗ g4! , winning the queen via the forking check 2...♕ xg4
3.♘ h6+, 1-0 .
The fork theme figures here on the most typical squares, f6 and e7:
FCM 1.35
Szabo-I.Polgar Budapest 1968
1. ♗ d7!
Computer eyes also examine this 'impossible' move because it is very forcing.
1... ♘ xd7
1...♕ xd7 2.♘ f6+.
2. ♕ xc8! 1-0 Again the fork trick 2...♕ xc8 3.♘ e7+ wins: 3...♔ g7
4.♘ xc8 ♖ xc8 5.♖ xd7.
FCM 1.36
Gunnarsson-Slobodjan Ohrid 2001 Here is another common form of the fork trick. Black dozed off, assuming that White must recapture the bishop, but instead came 1. ♘ ef6+! gxf6 (or 1...♕ xf6 2.♘ xf6+ gxf6 3.♖ xe8+ ♖ xe8 4.axb3) 2. ♖ xe8+ ♕ xe8 3. ♘ xf6+ 1-0 .
FCM 1.37
Gallagher-Curran Lyon 1993 Computer eyes should stay very attentive to this beautiful stock FORK TRICK on f7, which occurs often in practice:
1. ♖ xf7+!! ♖ xf7 2. ♕ xh6+!! ♔ g8 3. ♕ h8+! 1-0 White emerges two
pawns up after 3...♔ xh8 4.♘ xf7+ ♔ g7 5.♘ xd6.
FCM 1.38
Petrosian-Simagin Moscow 1956 Former World Champ Petrosian was known for his careful positional style; but it's a rather poorly kept secret that when tactical situations arose, his computer eyes were second to none:
1. ♕ a8+!
There's a 'stock perpetual' after 1.♘ xf7?? ♕ d1+ 2.♗ g1 ♕ h5+
3.♕ h2 ♕ f3+=.
1... ♔ g7
On 1...♔ e7 2.♕ xa7+ captures the rook with check.
2. ♗ xe5+!
A stock fork trick on f7 squashes Black's prayers.
2... ♕ xe5 3. ♕ h8+! 1-0
Rising US star Sam Shankland used this motif creatively to convert a superior ending:
FCM 1.39
Shankland-Robson St Louis ch-USA 2017 His queen activity is Black's only prayer to stop the powerful a- pawns, hence the decisive technical combination 1. ♘ e5 ♘ f6 2. ♕ h8+! salts the win: 2... ♔ xh8 3. ♘ f7+ ♔ g8 4. ♘ xd6 ♗ a6 5. ♗ e4 ♘ d7 6. ♗ c6 ♘ b8 7. ♗ b5 ♔ f8 8. ♘ e4 1-0 .
FCM 1.40
Kramnik-Nakamura London 2014 This far less typical example shows that if you always consider the most forcing move, a fork trick may appear on any square: 1. ♖ g8+! 1-0 . Smothered Mates In this famous stock pattern, a lone knight delivers mate against a king barricaded behind his own pieces (usually in the corner):
FCM 1.41
Suta-Sutey Bucharest 1953
1. ♖ g5!
Combining attack and defense! The black queen is glued to f7 (1... ♕ xe4 2.♘ xf7#) and White's next exploits this again:
1... ♕ xf6 2. ♕ d4!
Not the fingerfehler 2.♕ e5?? ♕ xe5+ check.
2... ♖ g6 3. ♖ xg6! 1-0
Sometimes the Smothered Mate theme is very well concealed in a thicket of variations, awaiting discovery by discerning computer eyes:
FCM 1.42
Saunina-Chekhova Sochi 1980
1. ♘ g7!!
Menacing 2.♘ g5, with the pretty brute force variations 1...♗ xg7
2.♘ g5! h6 3.♕ f5! hxg5 4.♕ h3+, and 1...♖ xg7 2.fxg7+ ♗ xg7
3.♘ g5 h6 4.b3! and 5.♘ xf7+.
1... ♗ xe4
Black has based her defense of h7 on this central breakthrough, but fails to perceive White's true motif:
2. ♖ xe4! ♕ xe4 3. ♘ g5 ♕ g6
position after 3...♕ g6
4. ♕ xh7+!! ♕ xh7 5. ♘ xf7# !
It is more difficult to smother the king on g1, but with some 'extra help' it can sometimes be done:
FCM 1.43
Marache-Morphy New Orleans blind simul 1857
1... ♘ g3! 2. ♕ xg6
If 2.♕ xd4 ♘ e2+.
2... ♘ de2#
There will be many more examples of such in-between forcing moves in Chapter 8. Perhaps the most common and important stock Smothered Mate in master play consists of the 'SELF-BLOCKING SACRIFICE ', by which an enemy piece is forced onto a square which was the king's sole escape hatch, paving the way for a smothering knight: (see fragment next page)
FCM 1.44
Niesslbeck-Kuh München 1946
1. ♘ f4! ♕ xe1
At first glance it seems that White has overlooked his back-rank liability, but trained computer eyes recognize that the black king is first to bite the dust!
2. ♘ g6+ ♔ h7 3. ♘ f8+ ♔ h8 4. ♕ h7+!! ♘ xh7 5. ♘ g6#
smothered mate
FCM 1.45
Kirilenko-Maevskaya Soviet Union 1974 The series of IN-BETWEEN FORCING MOVES makes this example even more beautiful, but computer eyes should note that each white move is the most forcing available-and thus needs to be analyzed first!
1. ♕ h7+!! ♘ xh7 2. ♘ hg6+ ♔ g8 3. ♘ xe7+ ♔ h8 4. ♘ 5g6#
One more stunning example of the self-blocking/Smothered Mate stock theme:
FCM 1.46
Mingrelia-NN Italy 1801
1. ♘ g6+ ♔ g8 2. ♕ g7+!! ♖ xg7 3. ♘ h6#
FCM 1.47
Gershon-Mihailidis Kavala 2004 No self-blocking sacrifice was needed here; just computer eyes to first notice that Black's pieces have done the job themselves, and creativity to uncover a powerful surprise forcing move:
1. ♕ b6! a6
1...axb6 2.♘ xb6# is a Smothered Mate, but now White feasts on
the weak dark squares around the black king:
2. ♘ c5 ♘ e8
Not 2...♘ b5 3.♗ xb5 axb5 4.♘ xb5.
3. ♘ 3a4 ♘ d6
Suicidal, but 3...♕ c7 4.♕ a7! ♖ d7 5.♘ b6+ leaves White with a very wide choice of winning moves.
4. ♕ a5 1-0 5.♘ b6+ follows.
C) Stock forcing moves by the bishop The most common stock mating patterns showcasing the bishop's unique talents occur on the important attacking diagonals a2-g8, b1- h7 and a1-h8 (for White). The a2-g8 diagonal A slicing bishop on the a2-g8 diagonal often wreaks havoc on the enemy kingside, menacing key squares on the monarch's doorstep. In isolated pawn positions the d5 blockade is the glue cementing Black's position. White is always searching for sacrificial means to break the blockade and unlock the light-squared bishop's latent power:
FCM 1.48
Gipslis-Savon Baku ch-URS 1961
1. ♖ xe6!
The ♗ a2 becomes a raging beast. Adequate but much less instructive was 1.♘ xd5 ♗ xd5 2.♗ xd5 exd5 3.♗ b4!.
1... ♖ xe6 2. ♘ xd5 h6
Savon sees his goose cooked and loses heart. 2...♗ xd5 3.♗ xd5 ♖ fe8 (not 3...♘ xd5 4.♕ xh7#) 4.♖ e1 ♘ xd5 5.♕ xh7+ ♔ f8 6.♕ h8+ ♔ e7 7.♖ xe6+ ♕ xe6 8.♕ xg7+ is hopeless.
3. ♘ xf6+
The machine suggests the rye 3.♘ e7+, winning the queen, but White is fixated on the brilliancy prize.
3... ♔ h8?
3...♖ fxf6 4.♘ xe6 ♔ h7 5.♘ xd8 ♕ xd8 6.♗ g5.
4. ♕ xf5
A sham queen sac forces an assisted back rank mate: 4... ♖ e1+ 5. ♖ xe1 ♕ xf5 6. ♘ f7+ ♖ xf7 7. ♖ e8+ 1-0 . Sometimes the force of a bishop strike on the a2-g8 diagonal is so overwhelming that it begs to be achieved à la Malcolm X, 'by any means necessary! ', as in this famous example:
FCM 1.49
Fischer-Benko New York 1965
1. ♕ e8+!!
Fantastic computer eyes. White does not overlook the second-most- forcing move, just because it seems insane! The real trick, of course, is to find such moves well in advance!
1... ♖ xe8 2. ♗ d5+ ♖ e6 3. ♗ xe6+ 1-0
The tandem of queen+bishop can make short work of an under- defended king. Here are the two most common stock mating positions involving a bishop on the a2-g8 diagonal:
FCM 1.50
Kotov-Lisitsin (variation) Leningrad 1939 With computer eyes you should quickly jump on a very forcing way to threaten mate:
1. ♖ xe4! ♖ xe4 2. ♕ g5 g6 3. ♕ f6! gxf5
Clearly forced to stop mate on g7.
4. ♕ xf7+ ♔ h8 5. ♕ f6#
a2-g8 diagonal stock mate #1 The second beautiful queen+bishop partnership involves a queen on h6 (h3 here):
FCM 1.51
Heinrich-Ewaldt Hamburg 1999
1... ♖ xe4! 2. ♗ xe4
White is relying on an 'EQUAL OR STRONGER THREAT ' (Chapter 5) to save the ♗ g5. But Black's computer eyes have seen an even better
'EST':
2... ♗ f3+! 3. ♗ xf3 ♕ h3+ 4. ♔ g1 ♗ c5+ 0-1
a7-g1 diagonal stock mate #2 Okay 'Mister Literal' - it's not quite mate yet, but it will be soon after
5.♕ f2 ♕ xg3+! 6.♔ h1 ♗ xf2 7.♗ g2 hxg5 and ...♕ h4+.
FCM 1.52
Polugaevsky-Ftacnik Lucerne 1982 Here is a very high-class example of a brilliancy utilizing stock themes. Black notices that 1...♕ g3 would threaten the thematic mate on h3 (the ♗ g2 is pinned and doesn't protect it), but is met by
2.♗ xb7 ♕ xh3+ 3.♕ h2. So first Black must find a way to divert the
white queen:
1... ♘ h5!! 2. ♕ xh5
Otherwise 2...♘ g3+.
2... ♕ g3! 3. ♘ d5
A desperate try to stave off the twin mate threats 3...♕ xg2 and 3... ♕ xh3. Computer eyes love double mate threats! They are usually extremely forcing.
3... ♖ xd5!
Black wants mate! 3...♗ xd5?? 4.♖ xd5 allows White to survive the assault against g2-h3.
4. ♖ f1!
4.♖ g1 ♖ d1!! mates on g2 or h3 (5.♕ g4 ♗ xg2#). White now
threatens perpetual check with ♕ h5-f7-h5+ !
4... ♕ xg2+!! 5. ♔ xg2 ♖ d2+ 0-1
The beautiful dénouement is 6.♔ g3 ♖ g2+ 7.♔ f4 ♖ f8+ and mate. Pressure on the a2-g8 diagonal often leads to a fatal PINNING of the f7-pawn and a breakthrough on g6:
FCM 1.53
Schlosser-A.Petrosian Baden-Baden 1996 Wrong would be 1.♖ g1? ♕ h5 2.♖ xg6+ ♔ h8 with counterplay against h2, but White finds the right way to exploit the g6 weakness:
1. ♖ xe5! ♕ xe5 2. ♕ xg6+ ♕ g7
2...♔ h8? 3.♕ xh6+ ♔ g8 4.♖ g1+.
3. ♕ f5!
With the transparent threat 4.♖ g1.
3... ♔ h8 4. ♖ g1 1-0 On 4...♕ d4, 5.♗ e4! decides.
With the BLACK KING on h8 (or h7) CUT OFF BY A SLICING BISHOP on the a2-g8 diagonal, stock combinations prying open the h-file for mating attacks take center stage:
FCM 1.54
Nunn-Fatin Lucerne 1982
1. ♘ g5! hxg5 2. ♕ g6 ♖ f6
Otherwise 3.♕ h5 is mate.
3. ♕ h5+ ♖ h6 4. ♕ e8+ ♗ f8
Or 4...♔ h7 5.♗ g8+ and ♗ f7+.
5. ♕ xf8+ ♔ h7 6. ♗ g8+ ♔ g6 7. ♕ e8+ High time to call it quits: 1-0 .
FCM 1.55
Fahrner-Danner Austria Bundesliga 2004/05
1. ♘ xh7! ♖ f5
The opened h-file corridor spells doom after 1...♔ xh7 2.♖ h4+ or
1...♕ xh7 2.♕ c3+ ♕ g7 3.♖ h4#.
2. ♘ g5 and 3.♖ h4+ wins. 1-0 A real opening debacle!
The queen may be the preferred 'dance partner' of a bishop on the long light-squared diagonal, but the knight knows a few good 'steps' as well, like a nice invasion on f7:
FCM 1.56
Tikhanov-Smelev Soviet Union 1970
1. ♖ xe4! dxe4 2. ♗ c4+ ♔ f8
Otherwise 3.♘ f7+ is deadly.
3. ♕ f4+ ♔ e8
The killer fork 3...♕ f6 4.♘ xh7+ denies Black any respite.
4. ♗ f7+ ♔ d7 5. ♕ f5+ 1-0
In the last two examples of a2-g8 diagonal dominance, computer eyes spy elegant material gain: (see next page)
FCM 1.57
Bacrot-Vogt Arosa 1996
1. ♖ g6!
This decisive surprise forcing move is much stronger and more efficient than 1.♗ c4+ ♔ h8 2.♖ f7 ♕ g6.
1...hxg6 2. ♗ c4+ ♕ f7 3. ♕ xg6+! 1-0
FCM 1.58
Adorjan-Fuller London 1975 A hostile takeover of the key diagonal renders the mild-looking threats on h7 suddenly deadly:
1. ♕ xd6!!
A fantastic feat of computer eyes! White should also win after
1.gxh7+ ♔ h8 2.♖ a4 (not 2.♖ d5 ♘ d4!), but the more forcing text
move decides at once.
1... ♕ xd6 2. ♗ c4+ ♖ f7
On 2...♔ h8 3.♖ xh7 is mate, but now White regains the lady with decisive interest:
3. ♗ xf7+ ♔ f8 4. ♗ c5 1-0
Stock bishop themes along the b1-h7 diagonal The other 'long white diagonal' b1-h7 also figures frequently in stock attacks against the castled king. The Classical Bishop Sacrifice In this stock attacking formula, the sacrifice ♗ xh7+ is typically followed by the attacking moves ♘ g5 and ♕ h5, targeting the squares h7 and f7:
FCM 1.59
Maeda-Houstoun Haifa 1976
1. ♗ xh7+! ♔ xh7 2. ♘ g5+ ♔ g6
The success of the stock attack rests on refuting both this move, and
2...♔ g8 (on 2...♔ h6? the king is impaled by the ♗ c1). On 2...♔
g8 3.♕ h5 ♖ d8 (the key is that h7 can't be defended; note that if the rook was already on d8 in the diagram, Black could now play 3... ♘ f8!, holding everything!) 4.♕ xf7+ ♔ h8 5.♘ xe6 wins, though even better is the thematic line 5.♕ h5+ ♔ g8 6.♕ h7+ ♔ f8 7.♕ h8+ ♔ e7 8.♕ xg7+ ♔ e8 9.♕ f7#!
3. ♕ d3+!
The typical 3.♕ g4 f5 4.♕ g3/h3 is also good, but this shot forces mate.
3...f5 4.exf6+ ♔ h5 4...♔ xf6 5.♖ xe6#. 5. ♕ h7+ ♔ g4 6.h3#
The Double Bishop Sacrifice Here the bishop sac on h7 is followed up by a second one on g7, baring the king to a frontal assault by the major pieces.
FCM 1.60
J.Polgar-Karpov Hoogeveen 2003
1. ♗ xh7+! ♔ xh7 2. ♕ h5+ ♔ g8 3. ♗ xg7! 1-0 Black quickly perishes
after 3...♔ xg7 4.♖ g3+ ♔ f6 5.♕ g5#; 3...f5 4.♕ g6!, or 3...f6 4.♗ xf6! with mate in 5 at most: 4...♖ xf6 5.♖ g3+ etc. A queen+bishop BATTERY on the b1-h7 diagonal poses many problems for the enemy king:
FCM 1.61
Herbert-Felmi West Germany 1975
1. ♘ h5! ♘ xh5
The queen's incursion is unstoppable.
2. ♕ h7+ ♔ f8 3. ♘ d5!
A typical sacrifice sealing off the king's escape at e7. The threat of
4.♕ h8# wins the black queen. 1-0
Here the idea of containing the black king is achieved by means of a
PIN ALONG THE SEVENTH RANK :
FCM 1.62
Bogoljubow-Johanson Oslo 1920
1. ♘ xf6+ gxf6 2. ♘ xd4 ♖ xd4 3. ♖ xd4 ♖ xd4 4. ♕ xh7+ ♔ f8 5. ♖ xe6! fxe6
Otherwise 6.♕ h8#.
6. ♕ xc7 1-0
This is vintage computer eyes, visualizing a series of forcing captures, and then looking one move deeper to find a powerful sting at the end of the scorpion's tail. The less menacing 'inverted' battery led by the bishop should not be underestimated:
FCM 1.63
Momeni-Nilsson Osterskan 1994
1. ♗ h7+! ♔ f8 1...♔ h8 2.♘ xf7#. 2. ♘ xf7! ♔ xf7 3. ♕ g6+ ♔ f8 4. ♕
xe6 Threatening 5.♕ g8#. 4... ♘ f6 5. ♗ g6! and mate on f7. 1-0 Stock bishop themes along the a1-h8 diagonal Domination of the powerful a1-h8 diagonal often leaves the enemy king precious few options, spawning a mother lode of stock sacrifices.
FCM 1.64
Rabinovich-Goglidze Leningrad/Moscow 1939
1. ♕ h6! 1-0 Mate follows on 1...♕ xf5 2.♕ xg7# or 1...gxh6 2.♘
xh6#. a1-h8 stock mate #3
FCM 1.65
König-Prins Hastings 1937/38
1. ♕ h6! 1-0 Black may choose his poison among the stock mates 1...
♘ xd5 2.♕ xg7#, 1...♗ xh6 2.♘ e7#, or 1...♗ xf6 2.♘ xf6+ ♔ h8
3.♕ xh7#. The only line that avoids mate, 1...♘ e6 2.♗ xg7 f5, is of
course hopeless as well. An a1-h8 queen+bishop battery is once again the ultimate diagonal weapon, threatening lethal incursions on g7 or h8:
FCM 1.66
Larsen-Andersson Sweden 1971
1.d5!! cxd5 Falling for it, but Black is already busted: 2. ♕ f6! ♕ d8
Black banked on disarming the diagonal battery this way, but computer eyes spotted a fantastic 'most forcing option':
3. ♕ h8+!!

FCM 1.67
Anand-Morovic Fernandez Sao Paulo 2004 One doubts that the sharpshooting World Champ wasted much time considering 1.♗ xh8 while the bigger game of the a1-h8 battery lay indefensible:
1. ♕ g5! h6 2. ♕ f6 ♖ h7 3. ♗ xg6! fxg6 4. ♕ xg6+ ♔ f8 5. ♗ d6+ 1-0 If 5...

D) Stock queen sacrifices The queen is a bit like the 'supermom' of the chessboard: she does so many things so well, all the time, that we tend to neglect her a bit until she does something really extraordinary. Since the rook and bishop have only one unique power, we associate certain 'special' stock combinations with them, even though the multidimensional queen could serve just as well. Think about it: we rarely talk about the 'power of the queen on the a1-h8 diagonal'! This we take for granted, because the ultra-mobile queen can be powerfully posted from... well, almost anywhere. The queen plays a crucial supporting role in many stock combinations involving all the other pieces, but she is so good, that rarely do we give her extra credit... So when we speak of stock combinations involving the queen, we are usually talking about spectacular recurrent SACRIFICES in which the lady gives herself up selflessly, in order to DRAW THE ENEMY KING INTO A MATING NET :
FCM 1.69

1... ♕ xb1+ 2. ♔ h2 ♖ g8
3. ♕ xh7+!! ♔ xh7 4. ♖ h4#
Alert computer eyes will notice a crucial detail: the less forcing move
3.♖ h4?? actually loses to 3...g5!, holding h7. So the stock sacrifice
was not only beautiful, but necessary. In this stock brilliancy, the queen gives herself up to confine the enemy king perilously to the h-file. A final QUIET FORCING MOVE (Chapter 6), freeing up the rook for the final execution, adds extra aesthetic appeal. (see fragment next page)
FCM 1.70

FCM 1.71
Andersson-Hartston Hastings 1972/73 Yet another example of a world-class GM forgetting to use his computer eyes, and falling prey to the most forcing move on the board! 1... ♕ h3+!! Mating after 2.♔ xh3 ♗ f1# or 2.♔ h1 ♕ f1+ 3.♗ g1 ♕ xf3#. 0-1 Double checks hold special interest, since they uniquely LIMIT THE OPPONENT'S OPTIONS by forcing the king to move. While ordinary checks may be met by capture or interpolation, it's impossible to capture or block two checking pieces at once!

3. ♗ xg7+!!
The basis of the brilliancy is the stock mate 3...♖ xg7 4.♖ h3+ ♖ h7 5.♖ xh7#, which forces the black king to take a lover's leap:
3... ♔ xg7 4. ♖ g3+ ♔ xf6
Again 4...♔ h8(f8) allows the stock rook + knight mate 5.♖ g8#.
5. ♖ g6# Are your computer eyes sharp enough yet to try the most
forcing move 3.♗ xg7+!! first before giving up on the sacrifice? If you answered no, don't worry; many more surprise forcing moves are coming in Chapter 4. Since stock king hunts are characterized by heavy sacrifices, they require, of course, superb board sight and very precise calculation to avoid the embarrassment of being a queen down with no mate in sight. The next example is exceptional for the original mating net woven at moves 5-6:
FCM 1.73
Toran-O'Kelly de Galway Palma de Mallorca 1967 Larsen famously quipped that 'with a knight on f8, one can never be mated!' Indeed 1.♖ h3 ♘ f8 holds the fort here, but White has a far more potent forcing option:

The calculation part was actually not as hard - White just chose the most forcing move (the one that needed to be analyzed first) at every turn! As we saw already in the second example, when the king is drawn deep into no man's land, exquisite quiet forcing moves may emphasize his helplessness:

CHAPTER 2
Stock mating attacks Study material Any study of master combinations will show an almost infinite variety of breakthroughs involving sensitive squares around the enemy king. Computer eyes are greatly enhanced by a ready knowledge of recurring forcing moves against these targets. A) Stock attacks against the square h7 We begin with the very important stock mating net of knight on f6 combined with a rook or queen delivering mate on h7 (f3/h2 in this example):
FCM 2.1
Holland-Shaw London 1995
1... ♕ xh3+! 2. ♔ xh3 ♖ h4+ 3. ♔ g2 ♖ h2#
♖ +♘ stock mate The stock mate also works with a knight on f6 and rook on g8 against the cornered king. Here Black was able to stop one incursion but not the other:
FCM 2.2
Grischuk-Leko Moscow 2014 Black's defence rests on 1.♔ f2 ♖ d2+ 2.♔ e1 ♖ d1+, but White finds the forcing improvement 1. ♔ f4 ♘ g6+ 2. ♖ 1xg6! ♗ xg6 3. ♖ g8# 1-0 . Here is a nice example of the extremely common stock ♘ f6+queen duo breaking into h7:
FCM 2.3
Moor-Pelletier Switzerland tt 1999 With the ♖ a5 hanging, White does not resort to 'knee-jerk' defensive play but finds a crushing EQUAL OR STRONGER THREAT (Chapter 5):
1. ♘ e3! ♘ xa5
Allowing the knight to hop to f6, but there is no time for 1...f5? due to the fine BRUTE FORCE sequence 2.♖ xd5! exd5 2.♕ g5+ ♔ h8 3.♕ f6+ ♔ g8 4.♘ xf5 when g7 is indefensible.
2. ♘ g4! ♕ e7 3. ♘ xf6+ 1-0
The queen falls due to 3...♔ h8? 4.♕ xh7#.
FCM 2.4
Lynch-Maderna Buenos Aires 1945 We should not neglect another important stock queen+knight attack against h7 (h2). A ♘ g4 combined with a queen on the b8-h2 diagonal is particularly dangerous, precisely because White does not have time for the natural defense 1.h3??, as played here and repeated many times since!
1... ♘ d4!
A devastating DEFLECTION SHOT.
2.hxg4
Not 2.♘ xd4 ♕ h2# or 2.♕ d1 ♘ xf3+ 3.♕ xf3 ♕ h2#.
2... ♘ xe2+ 0-1
A pawn on h7 often presents an inviting target. Being on the EDGE OF THE BOARD , it is the hardest pawn for wayward defenders to reach, and has only one neighboring button to help shelter it:
FCM 2.5
Tarasov-Asadov Soviet Union 1978 Black expected a queen trade after 1. ♕ f6+! ♕ g7 , but he neglected the bombshell Equal or Stronger Threat 2. ♖ e7! ♕ xf6 3. ♖ xh7# . In recent years the prettiest example of exploiting the isolated h7- pawn occurred in this instant classic: Vachier-Lagrave-Nepomniachtchi Wijk aan Zee 2011 Black really seems to consolidate and hold everything since on 1.♖ f7? ♖ h6 is strong. Chess truths very often defy appearances , which is why computer eyes are so powerful! Most human brains must be reprogrammed to consider the fabulous forcing shot 1. ♖ g7!! , mating on h7 after 1... ♔ xg7 2. ♖ f7+ 1-0 .
FCM 2.6
Khalifman-Bareev Wijk aan Zee 2002
1. ♖ g5! The ♕ h6 and ♘ g5 present a formidable battery against h7
after 1... ♗ xg5 2. ♘ xg5 , because characteristically, the ♖ f8 is tied to f7 by the threat 3.♕ xh7+ ♔ f8 4.♕ xf7#; while on 1...♕ any, 2.♖ h5! concentrates too many forces against h7 (2...gxh5 3.♕ xh7#), 1- 0 . Especially dangerous are situations wherein a rook on the 7th rank joins with other forces to attack h2. (see fragment next page)
FCM 2.7
Bluvshtein-Efimenko Montreal 2004
1...c5!!
A shocking surprise forcing move forcing a rook invasion.
2.dxc5 ♕ h3!
This quiet forcing move nails the pawn to h2. Wrong is the hasty 2... ♖ d2? 3.h4!.
3. ♕ c1 ♖ ad8 4.g4
Forced.
4... ♕ h4!
Staying focused on the h2 target.
5. ♖ g3
On 5.h3 ♖ d2, the queen infiltrates on f2.
5... ♖ d2 6. ♖ g2 e3!
The taboo e-pawn (7.♖ xe3 ♖ d1+) supports invaders on d2 and frees the h1-a8 diagonal for Black's bishop!
7.gxf5 ♖ xg2+ 8. ♔ xg2 ♗ d5+ 0-1
A superb example of brute force calculation and UNBIASED THINKING , i.e., computer eyes!
FCM 2.8
V.Gaprindashvili-Sakaev Linares 2001 Weaknesses on g2 and the back rank, and the sidelined white queen, suggest possible mischief, but the actual dénouement is the creation of an indefensible h2-pawn:
1... ♖ c1+ 2. ♖ d1
2.♗ d1 ♕ f3!.
2... ♕ h3! 3.f3 ♗ xf3! 4. ♗ xf3 ♖ c2! 0-1 The fall of h2 leads to mate.
A PAWN IN THE ENEMY KING'S CAMP on g6 (g3) combined with an attacking queen may cause a fatal weakness on h7 (h2), cutting lines of defense and escape:
FCM 2.9
Nijboer-Bosboom Leeuwarden 2004
1... ♘ g3! 2.fxg3 fxg3 3. ♕ xd5+ ♖ f7 when even jettisoning the queen
with 4. ♕ xf7+ cannot avert mate: 4... ♔ xf7 5. ♗ xe2 ♕ h2+ 6. ♔ f1 ♕ h1# .
FCM 2.10
Rustemov-Shabanov Elista 1996 Computer eyes see beyond the normal recapture on e7:
1... ♕ h3! 2.fxg3
Such a dastardly g-pawn must be eliminated at once, as otherwise after 2...♕ h2+ both 3...♕ xf2# and 3...g2+, queening, await.
2... ♕ xg3+ 3. ♔ f1
There is no solace for the forsaken rex in 3.♔ h1 ♖ ad8 4.♖ c1 (4.♖ d5 ♖ xe7!) 4...♖ d2.
3... ♖ xe7! 4. ♖ xe7 ♖ f8+ 5. ♔ e2 ♖ f2+ 6. ♔ d1 ♕ d3+ 0-1
So great is the power of a pawn on g6/g3 combined with an open h- file, that stock sacrifices are often employed to achieve it:
FCM 2.11
Brynell-Luther Plovdiv 2003
1... ♘ g3+! Winning the exchange by virtue of the crucial stock tactic
2.hxg3? hxg3+ 3. ♔ g1 ♖ h1+! .
Lightning strikes! Not the less forcing 3...♕ h7?? 4.♕ xg3, losing for Black!
4. ♔ xh1 ♕ h7+ 5. ♔ g1 ♕ h2#
FCM 2.12
Smeets-Werle Groningen 2002 Here the stock idea of creating a 'mating pawn' on g6 enables a fatal assault on h7:
1. ♕ g6!!
The corridor mate after 1...hxg6 2.hxg6+ is backed up by the threat
2.♘ g5!.
1... ♘ b4
No help is 1...♖ xd3 2.♖ dg1!.
2. ♖ dg1!
Now the game finished attractively:
2... ♗ f8 3. ♘ f6! ♘ xd3+ 4. ♔ b1 hxg6 5.hxg6+ ♗ xh1 6. ♖ xh1#
Something similar would have happened after 2...♘ xd3+ 3.♔ b1 ♗ f8 (White wins a rook after 3...♖ g8 4.fxg8♕ + ♖ xg8 5.cxd3) 4.♘ g5! hxg6 5.hxg6+ ♗ xh1 6.♖ xh1#. Here a beautiful stock mate on h7 relies on a SELF-BLOCKING ENEMY PAWN on g5 containing the black king. Excellent computer eyes are in play, as all five white moves are the most forcing:
FCM 2.13
Weissgerber-Rellstab Bad Pyrmont 1933
1. ♕ d8+ ♔ g7 2. ♖ xg5+! hxg5 3.h6+!
The key!
3... ♔ xh6 4. ♕ h8+ ♖ h7 5. ♕ xh7#
In Chapter 1 we examined some stock bishop sacrifices against h7 to disrupt the king's fortress. In many cases, the aim is simpler: to win a pawn by drawing the king into a forking check by White's queen. In this standard tabiya commonly reached via the Panov-Botvinnik Attack of the Caro-Kann, Black must avoid the developing move 1... b6? (as happened in Hertan-Kensek, New Mexico 1993, among countless other instances) which miserably drops a pawn to 2.♘ xd5 exd5 3.♗ xh7+! and a forking check on c2. A more impressive example occurred in the following game, where losing a pawn was only the start of White's nightmare:
FCM 2.14
Zerebukh-Nakamura St Louis ch-USA 2017
1... ♖ xh2 2. ♖ fd1
On 1.♔ xh2 ♘ g4+ while if 1.♘ xe4 the stock forcing blow 1...♖ h1+! 2.♔ xh1 ♖ h8+ forces White to give his queen to stave off mate on h2. Finally 1.♗ xf7 ♖ dh8 (threat: 2...♖ h1+) 2.♖ fe1 ♘ g4
3.♕ xa7 ♖ h1+! 4.♘ xh1 ♖ xh1+ 5.♔ xh1 ♕ h2# is a beautiful twin.
2... ♖ dh8 3. ♕ xa7
White seeks compensation, while Black welcomes this capture, having bigger fish to fry.
3....e3! 4. ♕ xe3 ♘ g4! 0-1 The stock double rook sac on h1 decides.
B) Stock attacks against the square g7 Here is perhaps the most common and important of the many direct 'bunker busting' stock sacrifices on g7. The key idea of these shots is to expose the king to direct attack on the g-file by the major pieces:
FCM 2.15
Najer-Ionov St Petersburg 2004
1. ♖ xg7+! ♔ xg7 2. ♕ g5+ ♔ h8 3. ♕ f6+ ♔ g8 4. ♖ g1#
In master play most instances are more complicated, requiring strong brute force calculation:
FCM 2.16
Potkin-Kopylov Bad Wiessee 2004
1. ♖ xg7+! ♔ xg7
Just as bad is 1...♔ f8 2.♕ g5 ♔ e8 3.♕ f6! ♔ d7 (3...♖ d7 4.♖ g8#) 4.♕ xf7+.
2. ♖ g1+ ♗ g6
Or 2...♔ f8 3.♕ b4+!, hitting b7.
4. ♕ f6+ forces resignation.
When the g-pawn is the last bastion of king shelter, a thematic denuding rook sacrifice almost begs to be considered:
FCM 2.17
Xiong-Robson St Louis ch-USA 2018
1... ♕ h5+ 2. ♔ xg3
2.♔ e4 ♖ e8.
2... ♖ g8+ 3. ♔ f2 ♖ xg2+! and White capitulated since 4.♔ xg2 ♕ g4+
wins the queen. A secondary idea of the stock g7 bunker buster is to attack the newly-isolated pawn on h7: (see fragment next page)
FCM 2.18
Mikhalevski-Rabinovich Dieren 1999
1. ♖ xg7! ♔ xg7 2. ♘ f6! ♘ xf6
The stock mate threat 3.♕ xh7 can't be met by 2...♖ h8 3.♖ g1+ ♔ f8 4.♕ h6#, or 2...♗ xf6 3.♖ g1+ ♔ h8 4.♗ d3!.
3.exf6+ ♗ xf6
3...♔ xf6 4.♕ g5#.
4. ♖ g1+ ♔ h8 5. ♗ d3! With mate on h7. 1-0
In fianchetto openings, a primary task of Black's king's bishop is defending the dark squares near Black's king, especially g7. For this reason exchanging the bishop is a prime strategy for attacking Black's fortress, often combined with a line-opening sacrifice:
FCM 2.19
Harikrishna-Nakamura Wijk aan Zee 2014
1. ♘ h5! ♗ g7
Black is a day late and a Euro short after 1...♕ xa7 2.♘ f6+ ♔ h8
3.♗ xf8 with 4.♕ h6 and stock mate on h7 to follow; or 1...gxh5 2.♕
g5+ ♔ h8 3.♕ f6+ ♔ g8 4.♕ xf7+, busting through.
2. ♗ xg7 ♕ xa7 3. ♕ h6 f5
To stop 4.♗ f6 with stock mate; 3...f6 4.♘ xf6+ is only a bit better.
4. ♘ g5 1-0
FCM 2.20
Sveshnikov-Sherbakov Moscow 1991 As we saw in Chapter 1, the situation may be critical when Black lacks a fianchettoed bishop to guard g7, and an enemy bishop rakes the a1-h8 diagonal:
1. ♕ g7+!! ♔ xg7 2. ♘ f5+
The double check forces a familiar stock mate:
2... ♔ g8 3. ♘ h6/e7#
The presence of a pawn on f6 or h6, in the 'belly' of Black's position, sets up the stock possibility of ♕ g7 mate. Computer eyes find many sacrificial ways to achieve and exploit such a 'craw pawn':
FCM 2.21
Muchnik-Estrin Soviet Union 1961
1. ♖ b3!
A deflection sacrifice offering a rook to break through on g7.
1... ♕ xb3
1...♕ a1 2.f6! ♗ xf6 3.♗ xg7! ♗ xg7 4.♗ h7+ wins the queen.
2. ♗ xg7! ♗ xg7
If 2...♖ e7, 3.f6 is sufficient.
3.f6 1-0
Drastic means are often justified to exploit a weakness on g2/g7:
FCM 2.22
Barus-Tkachiev Jakarta 1996 Black has a dominating position, and has several ways to cash in by forcing an f3-pawn in the opponent's craw; e.g. 1...g5! 2.♘ d2 g4!
3.fxg4 ♖ xd2! 4.♕ xd2 f3 5.♕ g5+ ♗ g7, or the neat computer line
1...♘ xe4! 2.fxe4 ♗ xe4! 3.f3 (3.♕ xe4 f3) 3...♗ xf3 4.♕ h2 (4.♕
b2 ♕ h1+ 5.♔ f2 ♕ g2#) 4...♗ c5+! 5.♘ xc5 ♕ g4+ 6.♔ f2 ♖ d2+. But Tkachiev's solution is also very clear and practical:
1... ♗ xe4! 2.fxe4
2.♘ d2 ♖ xd2!.
2...f3 3. ♕ f1 ♕ g4+ 4. ♔ h1 ♕ h4+ 5. ♔ g1 ♘ g4 0-1 The f3-pawn renders
h2 indefensible.
FCM 2.23
Emelin-Nepomniashy St Petersburg 1996 Passive defense by ...♖ g8 is often the only response to the stock mate threat ♕ g7, but White has several stock answers aside from the queen sacrifice ♕ xh7+ which we studied in Chapter 1:
1. ♗ xe5+! dxe5 2. ♘ f6
White forces a pawn to f6 by means of this stock h7 mating threat.
2... ♗ xf6 3.gxf6 ♖ g8 4. ♖ d8! Pinning the black rook and forcing 5.♕
g7#. 1-0 The intruder on f6 may even worm his way directly onto g7 by means of a sacrifice, creating winning mating or queening threats:
FCM 2.24
Virtanen-Bergquist correspondence game, 1974
1. ♖ g8+! ♕ xg8 2. ♕ g7+! 1-0 It's a smothered mate after 2...♕ xg7+
3.fxg7+ ♔ g8 4.♘ e7#.
A pawn on h6 also limits the king's sphere and sets up stock mating threats on g7:
FCM 2.25
Gausel-Tallaksen Molde 2004 Black is in a desperate race to remove the offender with 1...♗ xh6, but White strikes first:
1. ♖ d8 Crisper than 1.♕ d8 ♕ xd8 2.♖ xd8 ♗ b5 3.♘ xh7!, which
also wins.
1... ♕ c6 2. ♘ xf7! ♗ xf7 3. ♕ g7#
FCM 2.26
Nunn-Murshed London 1985 Black's counterplay looks strong, but super-grandmasterly computer eyes have prepared a blistering barrage of forcing moves based on the power of the pawn on h6:
1. ♗ e5!! ♖ xf2
The main point is 1...♗ xe5 (1...♕ xe5 2.♖ g8#) 2.♖ g8+! ♕ xg8
3.♕ xe5+!, delivering mate on g7.
2. ♖ e4!
More elegant than 2.♗ xf6+ ♖ xf6 3.♕ c3.
2... ♕ g8
2...♗ xe5 leads to mate on the back rank: 3.♕ g7+! ♗ xg7 4.♖
xe8+ ♗ f8 5.♖ xf8#.
3. ♗ xf6+ ♖ xf6 4. ♕ xg8+ ♔ xg8 5. ♖ e8#
Of course, other pieces (in lieu of a 'craw pawn') enjoy joining the queen in an irresistible assault on g7. The attacking duo of queen+knight is regarded as a virtual 'mating machine':
FCM 2.27
Gligoric-Gudmundsson Amsterdam 1950
1. ♕ e8+!
1.♖ xg7+! is another strong idea, mating after 1...♔ xg7? 2.♕ g5+
♔ f8 (2...♔ h8 3.♕ d8+ ♔ g7 4.♘ e6+ ♔ g6 4.♕ g5#) 3.♘ e6+ ♔ e8 4.♕ d8#, but Gligo's method is more forcing, since 1.♖ xg7+ allows 1...♔ h8!? after which White would have to find the long, brilliant mating sequence 2.♖ g8+! ♔ xg8 3.♕ g5+ ♖ g7 4.♕ d8+ ♔ f7 5.♕ d7+ ♔ g6 (5...♔ f8 6.♘ e6#) 6.♕ e6+ ♔ g5 7.h4+! etc.
1... ♖ f8 2. ♖ xg7+!
Also winning was 2.♕ e6+! ♔ h8 3.♕ e7 ♖ g8 4.♘ e6 ♕ b2 5.♘ g5! h6 (5...♘ e5 6.♕ xe5! ♕ xe5 7.♘ f7#) 6.♘ f7+ ♔ h7 7.♘ xh6! (7...♔ xh6? 8.♕ h4#).
2... ♔ xg7 3. ♕ e7+ ♖ f7
Black is also mated after 3...♔ g8 4.♘ e6 ♖ f7 5.♕ e8+. 3...♔ g6
4.♕ xf8 holds out longest, but the exposed king will soon die of
frostbite.
4. ♘ e6+ ♔ g6 5. ♕ g5#
A great display of computer eyes. The most forcing moves did the job, using accurate board sight and brute force calculation, which we will study at length in Chapter 3.
FCM 2.28
Nikolic-Hracek Polanica Zdroj 1996 White concocts a winning raid on g7 with the help of computer eyes and perhaps some deductive reasoning. Noticing that 1.♕ h6 must be met by 1...♕ g5 (not 1...♗ f8, hanging f6), White next tries the interference shot 1.♘ f5, but finds the defense 1...exf5 2.♕ h6 ♘ e6!. This beckons the solution 1.b4!! ♘ a6 2. ♘ f5! and now 2...exf5
3.♕ h6 ♕ xe2+ 4.♔ g1 wins on the spot, while the roof caves in a
little more slowly after 2... ♗ f8 3. ♘ h6+ ♔ h7 4. ♘ xf7 ♕ c7 5. ♕ d3+! 1-0 . C) Stock attacks against the square f7 The ever-dangerous queen+knight duo wins many scalps on f7:
FCM 2.29
O'Kelly de Galway-Böök Dubrovnik 1950
1.e6! ♗ xe6
Black must cope not only with the threat of 2.♕ xf7#, but also with the stock shot forcing a self-blocking after 1...♕ c7: 2.e7+! ♖ xe7
3.♕ h8#.
2. ♖ xe6! 1-0
The most common stock forcing move on f7 is the sacrifice of a knight or bishop there to initiate an attack. As we saw earlier with the sacrifice ♗ xh7+, a piece sacrifice on f7 is sometimes just a ploy to win a pawn, by drawing the king into a material-winning tactic:
FCM 2.30
Karjakin-Van Wely Wijk aan Zee 2013 The sudden thrust 1. ♗ xf7+! decides the issue on 1...♕ xf7 2.♕ xd8+ or 1...♔ xf7 2.♕ xh7+; Black wisely ceased hostilities after 1... ♔ g7 2. ♘ e4 1-0 .
FCM 2.31
Thipsay-Prathamesh Mumbai 2003
1. ♗ xf7+!
Computer eyes note a move order issue: 1.♘ xe4? would allow 1... ♖ xe4 2.♗ xf7+ ♔ h8!.
1... ♔ xf7 2. ♘ xe4 ♕ e5
2...♖ xe4 fails to the forking check 3.♕ f3+.
3. ♖ f1+ ♔ e7
Adding insult to injury. The king must step into a minefield to avoid losing the exchange by 3...♔ g8 4.♘ f6+.
4. ♕ g4 1-0 Black's position is in ruins.
Even a rook may sometimes play a temporary sacrifice on f7:
FCM 2.32
Ibragimov-Kalegin Elista 1995
1. ♖ xf7! ♔ xf7 If 1...♖ b8, 2.♕ xb8+ or 2.♖ b7 wins.
2. ♕ b7+ Regaining the rook with interest. Characteristically of such
stock shots, Black is not only down a pawn, but his king's cover is seriously compromised. 1-0
FCM 2.33
Varga-Portisch Miskolc 2004 Given f7's proximity to the center, it isn't surprising that many stock shots there result in central breakthroughs:
1. ♘ xf7! ♘ xf7 2. ♖ xd7! ♘ xd7 3. ♘ e6+ 1-0 White regains the rook after
the pinning 3...♔ g8? 4.♘ xg5 or the discovery 3...♔ e7 4.♘ xg5+. An excellent piece of board sight and brute force calculation.
FCM 2.34
Vokarev-Asmundsson Istanbul 2003
1. ♗ xf7+! ♔ xf7 2. ♕ e6+ ♔ g7
2...♔ f8 allows the stock mate 2.♗ h6#, but now White crashes
through in the center:
3. ♘ f5+! gxf5 4. ♖ xd7 , winning the queen or regaining the ♗ e7 with
a lethal attack. 1-0 Another common objective of the stock sacrifice on f7 is to undermine the e6-square:
FCM 2.35
Reis-Rodrigues Lisbon 1996
1. ♘ xf7! ♔ xf7
1...♘ f8 2.♘ d6! is murder.
2. ♕ xe6+ ♔ f8 3. ♕ e7+ ♔ g8 4. ♖ g3 g5
Or 4...♘ f6 5.♖ xg7+ ♔ h8 6.♕ xc7.
5. ♖ xg5+! hxg5 6. ♕ xg5+ ♔ h8 7. ♖ e7 ♖ g8 8. ♕ h6#
FCM 2.36
Zollbrecht-Cvitan Biel 1993
1. ♘ xf7! ♖ xf7 2.e6 1-0
The normal purpose of a stock sacrifice on f7 is not so subtle; namely, the destruction of Black's kingside, leading to mate:
FCM 2.37
Rozentalis-Luther Panormo 2001
1. ♘ xf7! ♔ xf7
More resilient was 1...♖ xd3, after which 2.♘ h6+ is best.
2. ♗ xg6+ ♔ f8
Mate also follows on 2...♔ e7 3.♕ xe6+ or 2...♔ g8 3.♖ xd8 ♖ xd8
4.♕ xe6+ ♔ h8 5.♖ h1+.
3. ♖ xd8 ♖ xd8 4. ♕ xe6
Sharp computer eyes have perceived a stock double mate threat.
4... ♗ d5
Other defenses of f7 meet the same end.
5. ♕ e8+! ♖ xe8 6. ♖ xe8#
When a queen+bishop combine in attacking f7, the defender must also contend with possible mating incursions on g8:
FCM 2.38
Gutman-Kholmov Riga 1975
1. ♖ xe7! ♗ xe7 2. ♘ xg6+! fxg6
2...♔ e8 3.♕ xe7# or 2...♔ g7 3.♘ xe7+ is a rout.
3. ♕ xg6 ♘ e5 4. ♗ h6+! ♖ xh6 5. ♕ g8#
FCM 2.39
Bareev-Sakaev Moscow 2001 Often the result of a sacrifice on f7 is a decisive breakthrough on h7 by the queen:
1. ♘ xf7! ♔ xf7 2. ♕ xh7+ ♔ f6
Otherwise Black is crushed after 2...♔ f8 3.♗ xg6, e.g. 2...♗ e8
3.♕ h8+ ♔ e7 4.♕ g7+ ♔ d6 5.♖ fd1.
2. ♕ xg6+ ♔ e7 3. ♕ g7+ ♔ d6
White's fine assessment of Black's flight attempt goes beyond a mere stock combination and into the territory of advanced brute force calculation.
4. ♖ fd1! ♕ b4 5.e4 ♗ a4
5...♘ b6 6.♖ ac1!, or 5...♘ e7 6.a3! ♕ c5 (on 6...♕ b6, 7.e5+ wins
the ♘ e7) 7.♖ ac1 ♖ g8 8.♗ b5+! ♘ d5 9.♕ xd7+ or first 9.♖ xd5+.
6. ♖ ac1! e5
6...♗ xd1 7.e5#.
7. ♗ c2 1-0
Another key theme of f7 sacrifices is a knight fork on g5 (g4 here), e5 or d6:
FCM 2.40
Vescovi-I.Sokolov Malmö 1995 White suffered an opening meltdown after 1... ♗ xf2+! 2. ♔ xf2 . In the game White resigned after 2.♔ f1 ♗ g4! 3.♕ xf2 ♖ xe5 4.♔ g1 ♕ e7; also horrible is 2.♕ xf2 ♖ xe5+ 3.♔ d1 (3.♔ f1 ♖ f5) 3... ♗ g4+ 4.♔ c2 ♖ e2 and 5...♘ xd5.
2... ♖ xe5 3. ♕ xe5
Losing to a fork trick, but otherwise 3...♘ g4+ anyway with a winning attack.
3... ♘ g4+ 0-1
FCM 2.41
Moiseenko-Areschenko Kharkov 2004
1. ♗ xf7+! ♔ xf7 2.e6+! ♔ f8
Awful necessity. If 2...♔ g8 3.exd7 the stock attack 4.♕ e6+ and
5.♘ g5 looms, while on 2...♗ xe6 3.♘ g5+ is tremendous; for if 3...
♔ f8, 4.♕ xe6 threatens mate on f7 and h7; while 3...♔ f6 is blasted by 4.♕ xe6+ and 5.♖ xc8.
3.exd7 ♖ d8 4. ♖ a2
Engaging the reserves. The forcing 4.♘ g5! might have been even stronger.
4... ♖ xd7 5. ♖ ac2!
Black can't defend both the c-file onslaught and the coming ♘ g5, e.g. 5...♖ d8 6.♖ c7 ♖ e8 7.♕ d2 ♕ d8 8.♖ d7 ♕ f6 9.♖ cc7.
5... ♕ e8 6. ♖ c8 ♖ d8 7. ♖ xd8 ♕ xd8 8. ♘ g5! ♕ d7
8...♕ xg5 9.♖ c8+ ♔ f7 10.♕ e8+ ♔ f6 11.♖ c6+ ♔ f5 12.♕ e6#.
9. ♖ c7! 1-0 The fork trick 9...♕ xc7 10.♘ e6+ decides.
Naturally an open f-file is a big asset in sacrificial raids on f7:
FCM 2.42
Hartston-Penrose London 1963 Here the veteran English master offered a 'strategic' draw to his young opponent. Hartston took the bait, and suffered the agony of being shown the stock mating attack 1. ♖ xf7! ♔ xf7 2. ♗ c4+ ♔ f8 3. ♖ f1+ ♗ f6 4. ♖ xf6+! gxf6 5. ♕ g8+ ♔ e7 6. ♕ e6+ ♔ f8 7. ♕ xf6+ and mate next: 1-0 .
FCM 2.43
Ye Jiangchuan-J.Polgar Prague 2002
1. ♗ e7! ♘ f5 2. ♖ xf5!
Another elegant win was 2.g6! fxg6 3.♕ xe6+ ♔ g7 4.♖ xf5! etc.
2...exf5 3.e6! ♖ f8
On 3...fxe6, quickest is 4.g6! with the stock mate 4...hxg6 5.♕ xg6+ ♔ h8 6.♗ f6+. Simplest on 3...♖ b1+ is 4.♔ h2! ♕ b8+ 5.g3! ♖ b2+ 6.♔ h3.
4. ♗ xf8 ♔ xf8 5.e7+!
A reprise of the self-blocking stock mate 5...♕ xe7 6.♕ h8#.
5... ♔ e8 6. ♖ e1 and 7.♕ h8+: 1-0 .
In this typical 'isolated d-pawn position', the sacrifice on f7 softens the a2-g8 diagonal, leading to a breakthrough on d5:
FCM 2.44
Botvinnik-Vidmar Nottingham 1936
1. ♘ xf7!
A shot from the blue, but now the a2-g8 diagonal is vulnerable and the ♖ c8 is loose. Also strong would have been first 1.♗ xf6, with the same idea.
1... ♖ xf7
On 1...♔ xf7 2.♗ xf6 the focal point d5 is falling.
2. ♗ xf6 ♗ xf6
2...♘ xf6 3.♖ xf6! and 4.♕ xc8.
3. ♖ xd5 1-0
FCM 2.45
Schmaltz-Vouldis Fürth 2002 Black uses his development edge to launch an attack on the f-file:
1... ♘ xf2! 2. ♗ xf2 ♖ xf2 3. ♕ xf2 ♘ g4! 4. ♕ xd4 ♗ xd4+ 5. ♔ h1 ♘ f2+
Now Black exploits a stock 'mill' pattern (a repetitive sequence of discovered checks, also known as 'Zwickmühle') on the a7-g1 diagonal, to pick off White's center before recapturing the rook.
6. ♔ g1 ♘ xe4+ 7. ♔ h1 ♘ f2+ 8. ♔ g1 ♘ xd3+ 9. ♔ h1 ♘ xe1 0-1
Here a dramatic stock queen sacrifice on f2 is made possible by a fatal weakness on the a7-g1 diagonal:
FCM 2.46
Farago-Hazai Budapest 1976
1... ♕ xf2+!!
Computer eyes don't neglect the most forcing options, even if they look 'impossible'!
2. ♔ xf2 ♗ d4+ 3. ♖ e3 ♖ xe3!
Rook discoveries now threaten mate or the queen, and only some enjoyable brute force precision is needed to break White's defenses:
4. ♘ e2
4.♕ d1 ♖ e5#.
4... ♘ d3+ 5. ♔ g1 ♖ xe2+ 6. ♔ h1 ♘ f2+ 7. ♔ g1 ♘ e4+ 8. ♔ h1 ♖ xd2 0-1
D) Stock attacks against the square h8 These combinations involve direct sacrifices on h8, winning material or leading to a mating attack on the h-file; and sacrifices on other nearby squares, paving the way for a fatal invasion on h8. The menace of a queen+rook invasion on the open h-file is so tremendous that it often justifies heavy sacrifices. Simultaneous mating threats on h7 and h8 usually win unless the h-file can be contested.
FCM 2.47
J.Polgar-Berkes Budapest 2003
1.♕ h2? allows 1...♖ h8, therefore:
1. ♖ h7+!! ♔ xh7 2. ♕ h2+ ♔ g8
The idea 2...♔ g7 3.♕ h6+! destroys Black's chances to contest the h-file.
3. ♖ h1 ♗ xg5+ 4. ♘ xg5 ♕ xg5+ 5.f4 1-0
A defending ♗ g7 provides one of the best defenses against mate on the open h-file, while remaining active on the h8-a1 diagonal; but various stock sacrifices have been found to overcome this obstacle:
FCM 2.48
Shabalov-Bhat Alexandria 1996
1. ♕ h7+ ♔ f8 2. ♕ h8+ ♗ xh8 3. ♖ xh8+ ♔ g7 4. ♗ f6#
An equally strong stock sac, by the way, is 2.♕ xg7+ ♔ xg7 3.♗ f6+ ♔ g8 4.♖ h8#.
FCM 2.49
Sicilian, Dragon Variation analysis by Lilienthal
1.g5! ♗ xc3
Now Black is ready to deliver mate on b2, but the stock breakthrough sacrifice on h8 arrives just in time:
2. ♕ h7+ ♔ f8 3. ♕ h8+! ♗ xh8 4. ♖ xh8+ ♔ g7 5. ♖ dh1 1-0 6.♖ 1h7#
follows. The common stock sacrifice ♖ h8+ may provide a crucial tempo for a devastating queen check:
FCM 2.50
Malisov-Birnboim Jerusalem 1996
1. ♖ xe5! ♕ xe5
Not 1...♗ xe5 2.♕ d5+ ♔ f8 3.♖ h8+.
2. ♖ h8+! ♔ xh8 3. ♕ h5+ ♔ g8 4. ♕ f7+ ♔ h8 5. ♕ f8#
In some cases, the rook sacrifice on h8 is followed by a quiet forcing move threatening to entrap the king on the h-file and deliver a corridor mate, perhaps in conjunction with a secondary threat: (see fragment next page)
FCM 2.51
Kogan-Samaritani Bled 1998
1. ♖ h8+! ♔ xh8 2.gxf7 bxa2+ 3. ♔ xa2 1-0 After 3...♖ b2+ 4.♔ a1, White
makes a new queen due to the threatened corridor mate on h1. In the following thriller, White uses more violent means to corral the king on the a-corridor: a stunning stock queen sac, setting up a decisive double check:
FCM 2.52
Wahls-Bjarnason Malmö 1985
1. ♖ a8+!! ♔ xa8 2. ♕ a1+ ♔ b8 3. ♕ a7+! ♔ xa7 (3...♔ c8 4.♕ a8#) 4.
♘ c6+! and mate by 5.♖ a1, 1-0 . In other cases, the object of the rook sacrifice is the more pedestrian win of material:
FCM 2.53
Meijers-Golubovic Bern 1995
1. ♖ h8+! ♔ xh8 2. ♘ f7+ ♗ xf7 3. ♕ xd8+ 1-0
FCM 2.54
Malakhatko-Volokitin Kharkov 2004 Black exploits the soft spot on h1 to unglue White's forces before counterplay develops:
1... ♖ h1+! 2. ♔ xh1 ♕ xf1+ 3. ♔ h2 ♖ h8+ 4. ♔ g3 ♕ e1+ 5. ♖ f2 ♖ g8+ ,
regaining the rook with interest: 0-1 . In our final two examples, stock sacrifices on other squares are used to pry open the h-file, leading to mate on h8:
FCM 2.55
Fox-Bauer Washington 1901
1. ♕ xg6!! hxg6
Or 1...fxg6 2.♗ xc4+ ♔ f8 3.♘ xg6+ hxg6 4.♖ h8#.
2. ♘ xg6! fxg6
Otherwise 3.♖ h8#.
3. ♗ xc4+ ♔ f8 4. ♖ h8#
In this common version, mate on h1 is enforced by means of a pin on the a7-g1 diagonal: (see fragment next page)
FCM 2.56
Reshevsky-Ivanovic Skopje 1976
1... ♕ xh2+! 2. ♔ xh2 ♖ h4+ 3. ♔ g1 ♘ g3 and 4...♖ h1#.
E) Stock attacks against the square h6 Sacrifices on h6 are most often directed toward weakening various squares around the enemy king, including g6, g7 and f6, as well as the h- and g-files. However, in some cases h6 itself is the final target:
FCM 2.57
Hirn-Stuhl Schwäbisch Gmünd 2003
1. ♗ xh6! gxh6 2. ♕ g5 1-0
When the opponent controls the a7-g1 diagonal, the move h2-h3 may represent a foolish weakening of g3:
FCM 2.58
Gilea-Atalik Sovata 2003
1... ♗ xh3!
1...♕ g3!, as played in Tatai-Kortchnoi, Beer-Sheva 1978, would
also win a pawn.
2.gxh3 ♕ g3+ 3. ♔ h1 ♕ xh3+ 4. ♔ g1
4.♘ h2 unfortunately hangs the ♗ d3. But now White becomes
hopelessly tied to defending h2, and can't reorganize to shield the shaky king.
4... ♘ g4! 5. ♗ f5 ♘ ce5! 6. ♗ xg4 ♘ xg4 7. ♘ b3 ♕ g3+ 8. ♔ h1 ♗ xf2 0-1
The stock queen + bishop mate threat with 9...♕ h3 ends it.
FCM 2.59
Carlsen-Nakamura Wijk aan Zee 2011 The 'bunker buster' is a version of the sacrifice on h6 which merits special attention. It commonly arises from Sicilian Defenses like this one, when the attacking thrust g5-g6 is met logically with ...h7-h6, trying to keep lines closed; and also in King's Indian formations where Black's pawn advances to g3. In such positions the sacrifice ♗ xh6 is strategic as well as tactical. White's only real positional trumps are on the kingside; if he can't break through there, his long- term prospects are sketchy. In this happy example the forcing lines work to perfection, and Black is demolished tactically and strategically:
1. ♗ xh6!
No casual decision, but 1...♕ xd4 is refuted by a stock mate on h7:
2.♗ e3 followed by 3.♖ h8!+ etc.
1...gxh6 2.g7!
The thematic follow-up - Black's bunker is stripped bare.
2... ♗ e7
Or 2...♗ xg7 3.♘ f5 ♖ c7 4.♘ h6+, winning the queen and more, since 4...♔ g8 5.♖ h8 is mate.
3. ♖ xh6 ♘ f7 4. ♕ g6
Threatening 5.♖ xf7!. Magnus shows again why he may be the greatest human to ever lift a chess piece.
4... ♘ xh6 5. ♕ xh6 ♗ f6 6. ♕ h8+ ♔ f7 7.g8 ♕ + Or 7.♖ xf6+. 7... ♖ xg8
8. ♕ xf6+ ♔ e8 9. ♖ e1+ 1-0
FCM 2.60
Kramnik-Inarkiev Moscow 2014 An outpost deep in enemy territory, like White's ♗ d6, sets computer eyes on high alert.
1. ♖ xh6+! gxh6 2. ♕ xh6+ ♔ g8 3.f4!
White's kingside dominance is so acute that mobilizing the reserves is decisive. There are many roads to Rome now, but Kramnik's human way is very pleasing:
3... ♗ c6 4. ♗ f3 ♕ c8 5.f5!
White's attack is so strong, he has no intention of letting Black sac his queen with 5.♗ xc6 ♕ xc6 6.♖ f3 ♕ xf3.
5...exf5 6. ♕ g5+ ♔ h8 7. ♗ xc6 ♖ e6
7...♕ xc6 8.♖ f4.
8. ♖ xf5!
Threatening 9.♖ xf7.
8... ♖ a7 9. ♕ h4+ ♔ g7 10. ♖ h5 ♕ g8 11. ♗ e4 1-0
Sometimes the objective of the sac on h3 is just to land a winning check on g4:

Worse is 4.♗ xg4 ♕ h1#.
4... ♕ xh3+
Black has not only won a pawn, but has destroyed the king's cover, which he now exploits with elan and fresh computer eyes:
5. ♔ e1 ♘ f4! 6. ♕ f3 ♘ h2! 7. ♕ h1
The knights are dancing after 7.♕ f2 ♘ d3+, while 7.♕ e3 ♕ f1+
8.♔ d2 ♘ f3+ corrals a horse.
7... ♘ d3+ 8. ♔ d2 ♘ f1+ 0-1
FCM 2.62
Wang Yue-Yuldashev Calcutta 2001 The versatile sac on h3 can also lead to a winning tactic on the opened g-file:
1... ♘ xh3+! 2.gxh3 ♖ xc5! 3. ♗ xc5 ♕ g5+ picking up the ♖ c1. 0-1
FCM 2.63
Mattick-Lorscheid Lübeck 2001 Here the thematic sac leads to a winning assault on f3:
1... ♗ xh3! 2.gxh3 ♖ xh3+ 3. ♗ xh3 ♕ xh3+ 4. ♕ h2
If 4.♔ g1 ♘ xf3+ 5.♕ xf3 ♖ xe1+ 6.♔ f2 ♕ f1# is a pretty stock mate.
4... ♕ xh2+ 5. ♔ xh2 ♘ xf3+ 0-1 The fork trick regains decisive material.
Computer eyes take a keen interest when the stock ♗ xh6 sac strips both h- and g-pawns from the defense of the enemy king:
FCM 2.64
Komliakov-Gadjily Nikolaev 1993
1. ♗ xh6! gxh6
1...♘ xh6 2.♖ xh6+ ♔ g8 3.♖ h8+! ♔ f7 4.♗ h5+ g6 5.♗ xg6+! ♔

2. ♖ xh6+ ♘ xh6 3. ♕ xh6+ ♔ g8 4. ♗ c4!
This quiet forcing move renders Black helpless.
4... ♘ e6
A pretty mate greets 4...♔ f7 5.♘ c7+ ♘ e6 6.♕ h7#, while on 4... ♖ f7 5.♘ xe7+ ♕ xe7 6.♖ xf6! the pinned f7-rook is doomed in light of 6...♖ f8 7.♖ g6#.
5. ♕ g6+ ♔ h8 6. ♖ f3!
A typical rook lift exploits the empty h-file corridor.

calculation. F) Stock attacks against the square f6 In the study of master games you'll find many more stock tactics than we have space for here; but special to this edition we add some typical breakthroughs around the crucial f6/f3-square.
FCM 2.65
Kunin-Fuchs Gibraltar 2019 In Chapter 1 we studied the stock mating pattern with a ♘ f6 and a major piece on h7/g8. Sacrifices on f6 are often intended to pry open the g-file, and here the stars were all aligned: 1. ♘ f6+! ♔ h8 Too easy is 1...gxf6 2.gxf6+ ♔ h8 (or 2...♗ g7 3.♖ xg7+ ♔ h8 4.♖ g8+!) 3.♕ g2. 2.e5 gxf6 More dogged was 2...g6 3.exd6+ ♗ xd6 4.♘ e4+ c3 5.♘ d6+-.
3.gxf6 1-0 , as ♕ c2-g2-g8 prevails.
The stock piece sacrifice on f6 exposes not only the g-file, but also the squares h6 and h7:
FCM 2.66
Quillan-Movileanu Gibraltar 2019 Underdeveloped Black has left the kingside unattended, so the time was ripe for 1. ♗ xb4 ♘ xb4 2. ♘ f6+! gxf6 3. ♖ f3 . Another important feature of the sac on f6 helps the rook lift succeed. In the diagram Black could play ...f7-f6 or ...f7-f5 to defend along the second rank with the queen, but now the self-blocking ♙f6 nixes this resource.
3...e5
Fiddling while Rome burns, but it's mate anyway after 3...♖ d8 4.♕ h6! or 3..♔ h8 4.♖ h3.
4. ♖ g3+ ♔ h8 5. ♕ h6 1-0
It should be abundantly clear by now that stock incursions on sensitive squares near the monarch open the gate to other key squares. Tactics on f6 often look to establish a craw pawn there and mate on g7:
FCM 2.67
Movsesian-Tischbierek New York 1998 While the howler 1.♖ h4?? loses to 1...♕ e5+ and 2...♕ g7, 1. ♖ f6!! achieves the 'craw pawn' after 1...exf6 2.gxf6. 1...e6 Forced, to meet the new threat 2.♖ xg6+ fxg6 3.♕ xg6+ with 3...♖ g7. 2. ♖ h4 ♕ e5+ 3. ♔ h1 ♕ e1+ 4. ♗ f1 1-0 In the next example, the bid to immobilize Black's defences with a craw pawn could and should have been favorably declined. This points to another feature of bold sacrificial play - the disruptive psychological pressure it puts on the opponent:
FCM 2.68
Xiong-Karavade Douglas 2018 The attacker's impulse would be to strip the king with the stock blow
1.♗ xh6!, and indeed this is a little better for White, e.g. 1...gxh6
2.♕ xh6 (2.♗ xg6 allows the black queen to slide over to g7) 2...♘
f5 3.♗ xf5 exf5 4.♘ d5 ♕ c5+ 5.♘ e3. White wanted more and essayed 1. ♗ f6!? . Let's be honest - the cool-as-ice computer response 1...♗ d7! is the last thing most of us would consider, yet the engine assures us that Black is even better after 2.♗ xg6 fxg6 3.♕ xg6 ♘ f5, repulsing the attack (4.g4?? ♗ e8), when Black's queenside counterplay outweighs the pawn. Instead after 1...gxf6? 2.exf6 White has all the fun, and he won convincingly with 2... ♘ f5 3. ♗ xf5 exf5 4. ♘ xd5 ♕ c5+ 5. ♖ e3 ♖ d8 (5...♔ h7 6.b4! ♕ d4 7.c3 and 8.♖ h3) 6. ♕ h6 ♕ f8 7. ♘ e7+ 1-0 . Here's a marvellous example of various themes regarding the sac on f3. Khismatullin-Dubov Satka ch-RUS 2018 Even though forces are limited and g2 is easily defended, the stock blow carries enough venom to transform the position:
1... ♘ f3+!!
We add an extra exclam for superior computer eyesight. The idea of a powerful ambush against the isolated h-pawn was well concealed, confounding even an experienced grandmaster.
2. ♔ h1
The tremendous point is 2.gxf3 gxf3 (threat: 2...♕ f6-g5+-g2#) 3.♔ h1? (3.♗ xf3 ♕ xf3 is better but positionally dismal, and already lost per the engine) 3...♕ h4! 4.♖ g1 ♗ e5 5.♖ g3 ♗ xg3 6.fxg3 ♕ xc4! and the back-rank weakness costs White his shirt. 2.♗ xf3 exf3 is also strong for Black.
2... ♕ h4 3.h3
The attacking wizard Khismatullin is not excited about the turn of events, though no stronger was 3.♗ xf3 exf3 4.gxf3 ♕ h3 5.♘ d2 h4. Black's d-file domination and threats against the king should decide.
3... ♘ g5! Black played the superfluous 3...f5 first and still won
quickly, but this better move, menacing h3, along with threatening
4...♗ e5, is hard to withstand... 0-1 .
FCM 2.69
Caruana-Grischuk Paris rapid 2018 The f6-/f3-square is not only a great place to make a craw pawn, but also a fantastic outpost for any piece. For this reason, exchange sacrifices on this square are ubiquitous:
1... ♖ xf3!
The thematic blow also removes an important kingside defender, while 1...♖ xb2? 2.♖ c2 only equalizes.
2.gxf3 ♕ xf3
Computer eyes have honed in on dual threats against f2 and d5.
3. ♕ c2 ♘ xf2! 4. ♗ g2
Otherwise 4...♕ xg3+. The computer wants White to submit to 4.♕ xf2 ♕ xd5, but a seasoned super GM would rather eat his socks than pilot this dismal pawn down position in practice.
4... ♕ e3! 5. ♔ f1
If 5.♖ e5 ♘ e4+! (not 5...♕ xd4 6.♖ d5!).
5... ♘ g4
Threatening 6...♘ h2#.
6. ♗ e4 ♕ xg3 and White quickly folded: 7. ♖ e1 ♘ e6 8. ♕ g2 ♘ e3+ 9.
♖ xf3 ♕ xf3 10. ♕ f3 ♕ c1+ 0-1 .
FCM 2.70
Kamsky-Robson St Louis ch-USA 2015 A stock sac wasn't needed here, but simply occupying the f6 hole carried unexpected benefits:
1. ♘ f6! (the silly obfuscation 1.♖ d4 also wins) prevents the desired
simplification 1...♖ xd5? 2.♘ g8+! and creates a winning attack.
1... ♔ g7
On 1...gxh5 2.♖ xd3! with 3.♕ f4+ wins a piece or mates, while if
1...♘ c1 the most whimsical win is 2.♕ e1 ♘ b3 3.hxg6 and 4.♕
h4+.
2.hxg6 hxg6 3. ♕ h4!
With the deadly double threat of mate or discovery.
3... ♘ xe5 4. ♖ xd8 1-0 (4...♕ xd8 5.♘ h5+)
FCM 2.71
Svidler-Alexeev Moscow ch-RUS 2012 (playoff) Finally we must mention the stock rook sac on f6 designed to bust open Black's king position, shown here in crystalline form:
1. ♖ f6! Threatening 2.♕ xh6+. 1... ♔ h7 2. ♖ xg7+! 1-0 . It's all over
after 2...♔ xg7 3.♕ xh6+ ♔ g8 4.♖ f3!. G) Stock attacks against d8 and the uncastled king These mating positions are often associated with the swashbuckling 19th century style of play; yet in our modern era of complex openings, there are still many instances where one side delays castling, in order to maintain flexibility or pursue other goals. During such encounters, computer eyes must be extra vigilant for opportunities to bust open the center with sacrifices and catch the enemy king in the crossfire. Square d8 is the focal point for many surprises against the uncastled king, often justifying heavy sacrifices:
FCM 2.72
Ostropolsky-Ivanovsky Soviet Union 1949
1. ♕ xd7+! ♖ xd7 2. ♘ c7+ ♖ xc7 3. ♖ d8# An old standard pedigreed to
Morphy-Consultants, Paris 1858. Underdevelopment can result in a fatal central assault when the enemy pieces are 'barely out of the box':
FCM 2.73
Beliavsky-Stean Lucerne 1982
1. ♘ xb5! axb5 2. ♗ xb5+ ♔ e7 3. ♖ fd1 1-0 Once again, twin mating
threats (on d6 and d8) are too much.
FCM 2.74
Bronstein-NN Sochi simul 1950 In many opening positions, ♖ d8+ is the most forcing move on the board, yet until we develop unbiased computer eyes it is easy to miss, since it looks so absurd!
1. ♖ d8+!!
The king is drawn into a deadly pin.
1... ♔ xd8 2. ♕ xe4 (better than 2.♗ xf6+ ♕ e7!) 1-0
When one side has an iron grip on the d-file, the centralized king may face surprising peril even in simplified positions:
FCM 2.75
Korchmar-Kulchinsky Soviet Union 1949
1. ♕ b4!
A surprise direct assault on e7! Black must resign due to 1... ♗ xb4 2. ♖ d8+ ♔ e7 3. ♖ 1d7# . The f7-square is especially vulnerable when the f-file opens before Black can castle: (see fragment next page)
FCM 2.76
MacKenzie-NN
1. ♕ xd8+!! ♖ xd8 2.gxf7+ ♔ e7 3. ♗ c5# An alert FORCING RETREAT .
The d7- and e7-squares in front of the king may also become targets. Computer eyes should take note of the better coordination of White's forces, as the uncastled king disconnects Black's rooks.
FCM 2.77
Vigorito-Maldonado Woburn 1995
1. ♖ xe6+! fxe6 2. ♕ d7#
FCM 2.78
Rapport-Dominguez Perez Wijk aan Zee 2014 White has done himself no favors by foregoing castling. It's instructive how Black parlays White's exposed king and disjointed forces into a crushing sacrificial attack:
1... ♗ xe2! 2. ♔ d2
If 2.♖ xe2 ♕ g4 (the forcing point is the double threat on f4/g1) 3.♗ h2 ♘ f5! 4.♖ bb2 ♕ g2!, threatening 5...♕ h1+, is overwhelming. White's queen, cut off from the center by the ♘ b3, is just a bystander in these lines.
2... ♕ g4 3. ♘ xc5 ♕ xh4!
White's king is too exposed and the attack almost plays itself.
4. ♗ e3 ♘ f5
The main line is 5.♖ xe2 ♘ xe3 6.♖ be1 (6.♖ xe3 ♕ f2+) 6...♕ xg5 7.♖ xe3 ♖ xe3 8.♖ xe3 ♖ e8-+.
5. ♖ xf5 gxf5 6.g6 ♖ xe3 7. ♔ xe3 ♖ e8+ 8. ♔ d2 ♕ f2 9.gxf7+ ♔ xf7 10. ♕
xa7+ ♔ g8 11. ♖ b8 ♗ xd3+ 12. ♔ xd3 ♕ e2+ 13. ♔ d4 ♕ e3# 0-1
FCM 2.79
Shabalov-Fridman Stratton Mountain 2004 The slicing ♗ c5 prevents castling and cuts Black's position in half. Start the fireworks:
1. ♘ f6+! ♔ f7 1...♗ xf6 (or 1...♕ xf6) 2.♕ a8+ ♔ f7 3.♖ d7+.
2. ♖ d7+! ♔ xf6 3. ♗ e7+ ♔ f7 4. ♗ d6+ ♔ e8 5. ♖ e7+ 'For good
measure', White plays for mate (6.♕ a8). 1-0
FCM 2.80
Goloschapov-Tosic Moscow 1999 Once Black castles, White's central preponderance will come to naught, so computer eyes gravitate toward sacrificial solutions: 1. ♖ xe7+! and the game ended elegantly with 1... ♔ f8 2. ♖ c7 ♕ xc7 3. ♘ ce6+ etc.: 1-0 . After 1...♔ xe7 2.♘ f5+ Black is also doomed: 2...♔ f8 3.♕ d6+;
2...♕ xf5 3.♕ d6+ ♔ e8 4.♕ xb8+ ♔ e7 5.♕ d6+ ♔ e8 6.♕ d8#, or
2...gxf5 3.♕ d6+ ♔ e8 4.♖ e1+ ♘ e4 5.♘ xe4 ♕ e6 6.♕ xb8+.
In this final stock theme, White is willing to part with his queen, just to land a winning check on the e-file:
FCM 2.81
Taimanov-Polugaevsky Leningrad 1960
1.O-O-O!! ♕ xa4
Declining doesn't save Black: 1...cxb2+ 2.♔ xb2 ♗ e7 3.♕ xc6! bxc6 4.♗ xe7 ♔ xe7 5.♖ he1+ ♔ d8 (or 5...♔ f8 6.♘ e5 ♘ xe5
7.♖ d8+ ♔ e7 8.♖ xh8) 6.♘ g5 ♔ c7 7.♘ xf7 ♖ f8 8.♖ e7 and
9.♗ e6, winning material. In the game it was curtains after 1...cxb2+

5. ♖ fxd7+ ♕ xc4 6. ♖ d8+ ♔ f7 7. ♘ e5+ , winning the queen, 1-0 .

CHAPTER 3
Brute Force combinations Study material In the introduction, we defined the two core aspects of developing powerful computer eyes. The first task was accurate brute force analysis of variations, and the second was overcoming human bias in order to become more objective, and creative, in our ability to find unusual winning forcing moves. The term 'brute force' refers to the way machines 'think'. While computers analyze scores of variations and then try to draw conclusions, humans have a tendency to conceptualize positions first, with concepts like 'weak pawn', 'open file', 'better development', etc. This is natural and okay, but the problem comes when we make decisions based on such generalizations, without first testing their validity with concrete analysis. Developing computer eyes means learning to analyze essential forcing moves first, and always basing our final decisions on well-considered analysis. When the supercomputer Hydra crushed the incredibly strong English GM Michael Adams in a 2005 match, an age-old debate was put to rest. Many had believed that positional judgment or 'grandmaster intuition' could overcome brute force calculation of scads of variations, but we now know that accurate brute force analysis is the single most important chess skill . In Chapters 1 and 2 we began by training your computer eyes to become aware of recurring stock sacrifices, helping you recognize critical attacking positions and get in the habit of examining the most forcing moves first. At the same time, we began to examine the crucial role of brute force analysis and creativity in unearthing these powerful combinations. Having gained a basic knowledge of stock themes, you are now ready to learn how to better calculate the original, uncharted 'bread and butter' situations which occur most often in tournament play. Even 'straightforward' brute force variations can be very difficult to calculate accurately, because this analysis requires three essential skills:
1. Accurate 'board sight' - the ability to correctly envision where
the pieces are, and what they can do, even deep in the midst of a long calculation.
2. Accurate 'selection' - the ability to hone in on the key options,
and avoid two key pitfalls at the opposite ends of the spectrum: failure to consider unexpected, but crucial ideas; or wasting huge amounts of time analyzing 'dead ends'.
3. The raw ability and effort needed to calculate variations.
Fortunately, these skills can be developed through practice, problem- solving, the study of master games, and by gaining a deeper understanding of forcing moves. In this chapter we examine three types of brute force combinations: A) 'Bread and Butter' Brute Force combinations Most tactics books concentrate only on mating positions like the stock forcing moves found in Chapter 2. But these positions are relatively unusual in club play, compared with 'bread and butter' tactics: 2-4 move deep combinations winning material. Some of these combinations may utilize stock ideas in one or two side variations, but the primary focus is on accurate brute force calculation. B) Mating and 'Hybrid' Brute Force combinations This section is devoted to mating combinations which are too unique, or require too much original brute force analysis, to be considered 'stock' ideas; and 'hybrid' sequences in which both mate and/or win of material figure in the calculation of different variations. C) Promotion-based Brute Force combinations Combinations involving actual pawn promotion, or the achievement of mate or material gain via the threat of promotion, could constitute a worthwhile book by themselves. A strong awareness of these motifs is certainly a key aspect of developing your computer eyes, and we will revisit them many times, as they relate to different chapters of the book. A) 'Bread and Butter' Brute Force combinations
FCM 3.1
Karthikeyan-Vachier-Lagrave Gibraltar 2019 The critical position has arrived in this tense queenless middlegame. White is clearly better after 1.♗ xh6 ♘ xh6 2.♘ f4 ♖ b8, but as a practical matter he must calculate a long forcing sequence which may knock off his famous opponent decisively:
1.f3! ♗ xf4
The other messy try also required bold calculation: 1...♘ ge5!? 2.♗ xh6 ♖ xg2+ 3.♔ h1! (surprisingly 3.♔ f1 only draws: 3...♖ g1+ 4.♔ e2 ♖ 1g2+ 4.♔ e3 ♘ c4+ with a perpetual) 3...♖ 2g3! (threatening mate; inadequate is 3...♖ xb2 4.♖ b1 ♖ xa2 5.♘ c7! with the crushing fork threat 6.♗ d5+) 4.♘ f4! (better than 4.♗ f4 ♖ h3+ and
5...♘ xf3) 4...♖ h8 5.♘ h5 ♘ xf3 6.♘ xg3 ♘ xe1 7.♘ e2, winning.
2. ♘ xf4 ♘ ge5 3. ♗ d5+ ♔ e8 4. ♗ xg8 ♘ xf3+ 5. ♔ f2 ♘ xe1 6. ♗ d5!
White had to visualize all this, as well as Black's last-ditch next move, to choose the right line. If 6...♘ c2 7.♘ g6! snuffs out all counterplay before corralling the knight with ♖ c1.
6... ♖ g5 7. ♔ xe1 ♖ xf5 8. ♘ g6 and 1-0 .
Similarly here, evaluation of the critical position turns on a brute force shot.
FCM 3.2
Gostisa-Robatsch Ptuj 1995 If Black had one more move, he could establish a fortress with ...♖ g6 or even take the initiative with ...g5-g4. But White strikes first, destroying the integrity of Black's set-up:
1. ♘ xe5! dxe5
White has a solid extra pawn and more after 1...♖ h8 2.♖ f1, while on 1...g4, 2.♕ f4! gxh3 3.♖ f1 is very strong.
2.d6+! ♔ xd6
2...♔ e6 3.♕ f5+.
3. ♕ xf6+ ♗ e6 4. ♘ f3 Black is in tatters: 1-0 .
In messy, wildly complicated positions the only way to deduce that a position is 'critical' is often to find the winning line! In tactical minefields, every position is essentially critical:
FCM 3.3
Short-Zagrebelny Dhaka 1999 The old coffee-house saying 'Always check, it might be mate!' could be usefully amended as follows: 'When many checks are available, computer eyes carefully calculate each one, mining every line for potentially winning brute force sequences'. Four succinct and accurate checks bring home the point here:
1. ♕ g8+ ♔ e7 2. ♖ g7+
The quickest and most efficient, although here or on the next move, 2/3.♖ e1+ would also have won.
2... ♘ f7 3. ♖ xf7+! ♕ xf7 4.d6+ Prying king from queen - 4...♔ e6 5.♖
e1+; 1-0 . Even in relatively 'simple' positions, calculating one move deeper or more precisely often makes the difference:
FCM 3.4
Ehlvest-Golod Chicago 2004
1. ♖ c1! ♕ a5
Everything loses, e.g. 1...♕ d4 2.♗ f5! ♕ xd6 3.exd6, winning the exchange, or 1...♕ b2 2.♗ f5 ♖ fd8 3.♖ xc6! or also 3.♗ xc8! ♖ xc6 4.exd6, always exploiting the weak back rank.
2. ♗ f5 ♖ c7
On 2...♖ fd8 3.♗ xc8 the two rooks and passer dominate the queen. Accurate brute force analysis has now forced Black to allow a winning stock blow:
3. ♗ xh7+ Picking off the ♖ f8. Slightly simpler was 3.♗ e4!. 1-0
FCM 3.5
Nunn-Xie Jun San Francisco 1995 White plays two 100% forcing moves and calculates them through to material gain:
1. ♗ xe4! ♕ xe4 2. ♗ g5! ♕ b7 3. ♘ xf7! ♔ xf7
Other captures (3...♗ xg5 4.♘ xg5; 3...♗ xf7 4.♖ xe7) lose a pawn and the initiative.
4. ♕ h5+ ♔ g8 5. ♖ xe6 ♖ c5 6.h4 h6
Black strives for play rather than accepting a technically lost position. But, as so often, her activity hastens the end. Bad were 6...♗ xg5?
7.♖ e8+ and 6...g6 7.♖ xg6+!.
7. ♖ xh6! gxh6 8. ♕ g6+ ♔ h8 9. ♕ xh6+ ♔ g8 10. ♕ e6+ ♔ f8
Else 11.♗ xe7+ wins.
11. ♗ h6+ ♔ e8 12. ♖ d1! 1-0 . Capping a great performance with a
crushing quiet move, preparing 13.♕ g8+. In such complex positions, brute force vision rules.
FCM 3.6
Kasparov-Short Sarajevo 1999 Like with his 'Great Predecessor' Bobby Fischer, Kasparov's deadly and penetrating brute force calculation elevated him a notch above his peers:
1. ♖ h8+ ♔ f7 2. ♖ xc8 ♘ xc8 3. ♖ xb7+ ♘ e7 4. ♗ xg6+ ♕ xg6
4...♔ xg6 loses to 5.♕ g4+ ♔ h7 6.♕ xg7+. 5. ♕ b4 1-0
'Selection' of the right options was straightforward, as each move was extremely forcing; but the calculative skill and board sight required to assess White's piece-down position are the very essence of computer eyes.
FCM 3.7
Alatortsev-Boleslavsky Moscow 1950 Black is able to parlay a fleeting advantage in activity into a stunning brute force win:
1... ♗ h3! 2.f4!
The natural 2.♖ fe1 fails to 2...♖ xf2! 3.♔ xf2 ♕ e3.
2... ♗ xf1!!
Since on 2...♕ c5 3.♖ f2 holds, Black had to seek a creative solution, retaining the initiative.
3.fxg5 ♖ xe2 4. ♕ c3 ♗ g2! 5. ♕ d3
There is no time for 5.♖ e1 ♗ h3! and, at the right moment, ...♖ xe1+ and ...♖ f1+! with a winning ending.
5... ♗ f3!
Not 5...♖ ff2 6.♖ e1!.
6. ♖ f1
White has no good answer to 6...♖ g2+, e.g. 6.♔ f1 ♖ xh2; or 6.♕ d4 ♖ g2+ 7.♔ f1 c5 8.♕ xd6 ♗ c6+ 9.♔ e1 ♖ g1+ 10.♔ e2 ♖ xa1
11.♕ e6+ ♖ f7.
6... ♖ g2+ 7. ♔ h1 ♗ c6!
A beautiful quiet forcing move; not 7...♖ d2? 8.♖ xf3 with drawing chances.
8. ♖ xf8+ ♔ xf8 9. ♕ f1+ ♖ f2+ 0-1
FCM 3.8
Charbonneau-Tyomkin Montreal 2004 Again, a well calculated checking sequence brings home the bacon:
1. ♖ g8+ ♗ e8
If 1...♔ d7 2.♖ d8+ skewers the rook.
2. ♕ c3+! ♔ d7
Black probably intended 2...♔ b8, but then comes the surprising brute force line 3.♕ c7+ ♔ a7 4.c4! ♕ c6 5.c5! followed by 6.♕ b6+!, winning a piece.
3. ♕ c7+ ♔ e6 4. ♕ e5+! ♕ xe5 5. ♖ xe8+
A decisive zwischenzug.
5... ♔ f5 6.fxe5! e3 7. ♖ e7 1-0 White wins easily after 7...e2 8.♖ xf7+.
FCM 3.9
Svidler-Rublevsky Smolensk 2000 With major pieces roaming the board and the enemy king exposed, a series of queen checks is often (though not always!) decisive:
1. ♖ xc4! ♘ xc4 2. ♕ b8+ ♔ e7 3. ♕ b7+ ♔ f6
3...♔ e8 4.♕ d7.
4. ♕ xf3+ ♔ e7
4...♔ g7 is met by 5.♕ g4+ (but not 5.♖ c1 ♘ e5!).
5. ♖ c1 1-0 Now 5...♘ e5 fails to 6.♕ b7+ and after 5...♕ d5 the
endgame will be a dead loss. A quicker win, by the way, could have been achieved by 5.♗ xc4! ♕ xc4 6.♕ a3+ ♔ e8 7.♖ c1. A crucial function of computer eyes is that they enable you to know when to switch from a positional struggle to the complications of a tactical fray. Lesser players often back off in critical positions, rather than developing the confidence and work ethic to accurately assess messy tactics which may lead to victory:
FCM 3.10
Mokry-Stocek Czechia 1994 White sees through the illusion of the 'rock solid' ♘ e4 and accurately navigates Black's scary-looking desperation tries. Computer eyes don't fear ghosts, but insist on exposing them to the light of analysis!
1.axb5 axb5 2. ♖ xa8 ♖ xa8 3. ♘ xb5! ♘ xb5 4. ♕ xe4! ♖ a2
Very scary, but winning for White was 4...dxe4 5.♖ xd7 exf3 6.♗ xb5 ♖ a1+ 7.♔ f2 fxg2 8.♔ e2!.
5. ♕ c2 (not 5.♕ b1? ♘ xc3) with a good extra pawn: 1-0 .
Always examine the forcing option first, even in the opening!
FCM 3.11
Mohr-Atlas Ptuj 1995
1. ♗ xd6! ♗ xd6 2. ♘ db5 axb5 3. ♘ xb5 ♗ xg2 4. ♘ xc7+ ♗ xc7 5. ♔ xg2 1-
0 I am reminded of a miniature from earlier in my career: 1.c4 c5 2. ♘ f3 ♘ f6 3.d4 cxd4 4. ♘ xd4 e5 5. ♘ b5 d5 6.cxd5 ♗ c5 7.d6!? ♘ e4 8.e3 ♘ xd6?? Black could have tried the interesting sac 8...O-O!? 9.♘ c7 ♗ xd6
10.♘ xa8 ♗ b4+ 11.♗ d2 (11.♘ d2 ♗ f5 or even 11...♘ c6!?) 11...
♕ h4.
FCM 3.12
Hertan-Rohde New York 1984 But what could be wrong with this normal move, regaining the pawn? I didn't know the answer, but instead of playing routinely, I took one more look around for forcing moves and discovered a screamer:
9. ♕ d5!
Wriggle and squirm as he may, Black will lose the e-pawn with check, with an awful position. One problem is that White recaptures with check after 9...♘ xb5; another is that the ♘ d6 is loose after
9...♗ b4+ 10.♗ d2 ♗ xd2+ 11.♘ xd2. 1-0 , shortly.
FCM 3.13
J.Polgar-Aronian Hoogeveen 2003 Black had counted on ...♕ c4, but computer eyes found a brute force refutation:
1. ♖ c1! ♕ xc1
The cute point is 1...♕ xd3 2.♖ xc8+ ♔ h7 3.♗ c2, regaining the queen with interest.
2. ♗ xc1 ♖ xc1 3.d6 ♘ d7 4. ♔ g2 ♗ f6 5. ♗ c2 g6
Black is down material, but will also get reamed on the light squares near the king.
6. ♗ b3 ♔ g7 7. ♕ d5 1-0
FCM 3.14
Kramnik-Hübner Dortmund 2000 White obviously has a lot of pressure for the pawn, but can he overwhelm Black's fortress in this critical position? Again, the brute force answer is 'yes'.
1. ♘ xf5!
1.♗ c4! was also very strong, but White has correctly calculated that
he can already initiate winning tactics.
1...exf5
The opening of the a2-g8 diagonal now becomes decisive. But Black had no answer to the brutal threats on h6 or g7, e.g. 1...♘ xd3 2.♘ h6+ ♔ f8 3.♘ xf7 ♘ xe5 (3...♘ xe1 4.♕ xg7+) 4.♘ xe5 winning. Accurate envisioning of such tangled lines is much easier said than done, and is really the key to becoming a feared tactician. For most of us, it requires hard work and determination!
2. ♗ c4! ♘ f6
Or 2...f4 3.♕ f3.
3. ♗ c7! 1-0 The devastating point is revealed - the ♗ e7 falls. After
3...♘ xh5 4.♗ xb6 ♘ xg3 5.♖ xe7! the walls cave in.
FCM 3.15
Dreev-Cifuentes Parada Wijk aan Zee 1995 A bread and butter tactic tips the scales, before Black can plug holes with 1...♘ d5.
1. ♖ xd6! ♕ xd6 2. ♘ e4 ♕ e5
Or 2...♕ e7 3.♗ c5.
3. ♕ xb4 With a rook for two strong minor pieces, the position is
resignable amongst strong players: 1-0 . A great many attacks are based on fleeting advantages, such as a preponderance of force in the attacking zone (a 'time' advantage or initiative), as opposed to structural edges. These positions demand energetic forcing moves before the opponent can consolidate.
FCM 3.16
Rublevsky-Morovic Fernandez Poikovsky 2001
1. ♘ xe6! fxe6 2. ♕ xe6+ ♖ f7
More resilient was 2...♔ h8 3.♗ xe7 ♗ xg2+!? 4.♔ xg2 ♘ f4+ 5.♔ g3 ♘ xe6 6.♗ xc5 ♘ xc5, though White will be a healthy pawn up in the endgame.
3. ♗ xg6 hxg6 3...♕ xg5 4.♗ xf7+ ♔ h8 5.f3.
4. ♗ xe7 ♕ b5!
In desperate times, strong opponents are very dangerous. Computer eyes must anticipate their last-ditch attempts to complicate!
5.c4! ♕ xb2 6. ♕ d7!
A surprising twist; the bishop is tracked down in the open, while the attack 6...♖ xf2 is bashed by 7.♕ e6+ ♔ h8 8.♖ h3. Quite hard to foresee!
6... ♖ b8 7. ♕ c7 1-0
FCM 3.17
Keres-Sliwa Gothenburg 1955 After the sharp advance ...f7-f5?, Black hopes to attack with ...f4-f3, or blockade the e-pawn on 1.f3 ♘ g5 and ...♘ e6. But a simple bread and butter brute force sequence shows that the idea isn't viable:
1. ♕ b3! ♖ ad8 2. ♘ xf5! ♖ xf5 3. ♖ xe4 Winning a vital pawn via the
pin. 1-0
FCM 3.18
Mohr-Wach Ptuj 1995 White has every reason to seek a brute force solution in this odd position; if the initiative fizzles, Black will relish an imposing center, a nice bishop, and White's queenside weaknesses:
1. ♖ d8+! ♔ g7 2. ♕ g3+ ♔ h7 3. ♖ xh8+ ♔ xh8 4. ♘ a4! ♕ xc2 5. ♘ xb2 ♕
xb2 6. ♕ e3! Only now does White's superiority crystallize, as two tremendously important pawns are under fire. In the game Black lost after 6...a5
7.♕ xh6+ ♔ g8 8.h3 ♕ xa2? 9.♖ c1! and similarly, if Black were to
play 6...♕ xa2, White's advantage in king safety would decide: 7.♕ xh6+ ♔ g8 8.h3 e4 9.g3! followed by penetration with the rook. 1-0 Among the most bedeviling brute force lines are those that unleash an orgy of captures. The game hangs in the balance with each decision. Only good selection, board sight, and raw calculation will decide the outcome.
FCM 3.19
Akopian-Svidler Yerevan 2001
1.e5! ♖ xb3
1...dxe5 2.♗ xb7 exd4 3.♗ xd4.
2.exf6!
Not 2.♘ xb3 ♕ xe5! 3.♗ xa8 ♕ xc3.
2... ♗ xg2
The bishops are golden after 2...♖ xc3 3.fxe7 ♖ e8 4.♗ xa8.
3. ♘ xb3!
Every capture has fresh ramifications. On 3...♕ xc3, 4.fxe7 wins.
3... ♗ xf1! 4. ♕ g4!
Bagging the point.
4... ♗ xf6 5. ♘ xa5 ♗ xc3 6. ♔ xf1 ♗ xa5 7. ♕ d4 ♖ d8 8. ♕ a7 h6 9. ♗ b6
1-0
FCM 3.20
Sarana-Jakovenko Satka ch-RUS 2018 White seeks complications to ease his queenside problems, but forgets that one plays with fire when entering a long string of captures:
1... ♘ xe6! 2. ♗ xd6 ♘ xd4 3. ♗ xe7 ♘ e2+!
White's idea was 3...♘ xf3+ 4.♗ xf3 ♖ xf3 5.d6! with sufficient counterplay. But the selection of brute force options is paramount in these positions, as the opponent may 'jump off the trolley' of forcing captures at any turn. Now 4.♔ h1 ♘ f2# is a picturesque smothered mate, so forced is...
4. ♔ f1 ♘ f4+ 5. ♔ g1 ♘ e2+ 6. ♔ f1 ♘ 2xg3+ 7. ♔ g1 ♘ e2+ 8. ♔ f1 ♘ f4+
9. ♔ g1 ♘ e2+ 10. ♔ f1 ♖ c2 11. ♘ e1
The fitting finale is a beautiful stock smothered mate anyway:
11... ♘ f4+ 12. ♔ g1 ♖ xg2+! 13. ♘ xg2 ♘ h3+ 14. ♔ h1 ♘ f2#
These tricky 'stream of capture' positions highlight the role of brute force analysis as the great 'fact-checker'. Any time the opponent's defence relies on a tactical device, computer eyes have a responsibility not to trust the opponent's edifice, but to check it for calculative flaws:
FCM 3.21
Carlsen-Giri Wijk aan Zee 2011 What looks like another clever Magnus petite combinaison turns into a rare 'oops' moment after 1...e3 2. ♕ b2 ♕ xg5 3. ♗ xe3 . Obviously Magnus' concept since 3.♕ xb6 e2 4.♖ e1 ♕ xc1 5.♖ xc1 e1♕ + 6.♖ xe1 ♖ xe1+ 7.♗ f1 ♗ h3 is a stock mate.
3... ♕ g4! 0-1 . It's all smoke and mirrors after 4.f3 ♘ c4 5.♕ b5 ♕ d7.
Well-timed bread and butter combinations play as strong a role in converting positional pluses into material gain, as they do in tipping the balance in 'critical positions'. Knowing when and how to cash in on such advantages is an art in itself, but computer eyes are in the forefront, as usual.
FCM 3.22
Kasparov-Ivanchuk Frankfurt 1998 White has pressure against the weaknesses e6 and h4, but is it enough? Brute force calculation shows that White can already ignore the threat of 1...♗ xc3 and convert his advantage:
1. ♗ xe6+! ♖ xe6 2. ♕ g4 ♖ d6 3. ♖ xe6 ♕ xe6
Or 3...♖ xe6 4.♖ e1 ♔ d7 5.♖ xe6 ♕ xe6 6.♕ xg7+.
4. ♕ xg7 1-0 White has won a pawn while maintaining a strong
position. Amateur players often fail to perceive the positional benefits that can accrue along with material gain; did the lost pawn secure crucial squares, or anchor a chain?
FCM 3.23
Gelfand-Adams Wijk aan Zee 2002 Mickey Adams makes it look easy, in grandmasterly fashion; five bread and butter forcing moves with a lone subvariation, and Black's initiative blooms into a pawn plus and a crushing edge:
1... ♖ xf2! 2. ♖ xf2 ♘ f4!
This tremendous zwischenzug is the key.
3. ♕ g3 ♗ xf2+! 4. ♔ xf2
4.♕ xf2 ♘ xh3+.
4... ♘ xd3+ 5. ♔ f1 ♘ xb2 0-1
FCM 3.24
Chiburdanidze-Zsu.Polgar St Petersburg 1995 White is pretty clearly on the ropes, given the looseness of her position and Black's menacing minor (and major!) pieces. The master's imperative is to transform these factors into material gain or mate via the correct application of brute force:
1... ♘ xf2! 2. ♖ xf2
Forced, as both 2.♕ xf2 ♘ d3 and 2.♔ xf2 ♘ e4+ 3.♗ xe4 ♕ xe4 lose material.
2... ♘ xb3!
Forcing a massive simplification, correctly foreseeing the inability of White's minors to cope with the rook and passed b-pawn. Also very strong was the 'quiet' 2...♕ e5!.
3. ♘ xb3 ♗ xa1 4. ♘ xa1 ♕ e1+ 5. ♕ xe1 ♖ xe1+ 6. ♖ f1 ♖ xf1+ 7. ♗ xf1 ♖
xa2 8. ♘ b3 ♖ c2! 0-1
FCM 3.25
Handoko-Martin Gonzalez Lucerne 1982 White converts his edge by refusing to back down in the face of counterplay:
1. ♘ xe5! ♕ xg5
Not 1...♗ xe5 2.♕ xe5 ♕ xg5 3.♗ xd5+.
2. ♘ xc6 ♗ xh2+! A nice idea! Many years ago, the American hippie-
master Brian Hulse gave me a valuable lecture about the need to play for some imbalance in bad positions !
3. ♔ xh2
Of course not 3.♔ h1 ♕ h6! with too much play. Handoko has calculated that the direct method ends all resistance.
3... ♕ h6+ 4. ♔ g1 ♕ xc6 5. ♖ fd1 ♗ e6
Or 5...♖ d8 6.♖ xd5 ♖ xd5 7.♗ xd5+ ♕ xd5 8.♕ e8.
6. ♕ xe6+! Regaining the piece with a winning ending after 6...♕ xe6
7.♗ xd5. 1-0
B) Mating and 'Hybrid' Brute Force combinations These are 'non-stock' brute force sequences, combining mating ideas and the win of material. In Chapter 1 we saw how marauding major piece positions, where one or both sides menace the king, are decided by accurate calculation of forcing moves. Here brute force methods produced the one road to Rome. Everything comes with check, as it must, lest Black's counterattack against b2 land first. But there are many side variations, with no room for error:
FCM 3.26
Bharathakoti-Guijarro Gibraltar 2019
1. ♕ c8+ ♔ f7 2. ♗ xg6+!! ♔ xg6 3. ♕ e6+ ♗ f6 4. ♕ f7 +
Harmlessly gaining time on the clock in light of 4...♔ xg5? 5.♕ h5#.
4... ♔ f5 5. ♕ e6+ ♔ g6 6. ♖ h6+! ♔ g7
Or 6...♔ xg5 7.♕ g8+ ♔ xh6 (7...♔ g5 8.♕ g6+ ♔ f5 9.♖ h5+)
8.♖ h2+ and mate.
7.gxf6+ exf6
Also on 7...♔ xh6 8.fxe7+ or 7...♖ xf6 8.♖ g2+ the king is clearly sunk.
8. ♕ g4+ 1-0
Here is another major piece melee which was a de facto mathematical exercise:
FCM 3.27
Short-Lutz Budapest 2003
1. ♖ h7+ ♔ f8 2. ♖ xf7+!! ♔ xf7 3. ♕ f5+ ♔ g7
Or 3...♔ e8 4.♖ e5+ and mate on d7!
4. ♕ xd7+ ♔ g6 5. ♕ e6+ ♔ h5
The queen flies solo on 5...♔ h7: 6.♕ h6#.
6. ♕ h3+! ♔ g6 7. ♕ h6+ ♔ f7 8. ♖ f5+
White had to see this checking possibility way beforehand.
8... ♔ e8 9. ♕ e6+ 1-0 This sacrifice was too deep and unusual to be
considered a stock blow on f7!
FCM 3.28
Kamsky-Short Linares m 1994 Learning the strategic goals of your openings guides you to examine brute force variations which must be considered. In isolated pawn positions the break d4-d5 is so dangerous that both sides should examine its tactical ramifications literally on every move!
1.d5! unleashed the power of both rooks and the light-squared
bishop, initiating a mating attack:
1... ♘ xe4
The main line runs 1...♘ xd5 2.♗ xd5 ♗ xd5 3.♖ xd5 exd5 (3...♕ xd5 4.♘ f6+ ♗ xf6 5.♕ xd5+-) 4.♘ f6+ ♗ xf6 5.♖ xe8+ ♕ xe8 6.♕ xf6 and the stock mate threat wins the queen.
2.dxe6! f5
Sadly as good as anything. A sample try is 2...♘ f6 3.♖ xd8 ♗ xf3
4.♖ xe8+ ♘ xe8 5.exf7+ and mate.
3. ♖ xd8 ♖ xd8 4. ♖ d1 1-0
Here a simple but elegant brute force line forces mate or slow death:
FCM 3.29
Bareev-Van der Wiel Wijk aan Zee 1995
1. ♖ c7 ♕ f6
The only rational defense, but it loses miserably. White would have been able to bring on the end quite elegantly after 1...♕ d8 2.♖ xf7+ ♔ g8 and now 3.♗ g5! ♕ xg5 4.♕ e8 ♕ h6 5.♖ f6!.
2. ♕ e8 ♔ g7 3. ♗ g5! 1-0 . Even easier this time. White breaks through
to mate via f7, or wins the queen. The brilliant English attacker Michael Adams transforms a large positional plus into a flash mating sequence:
FCM 3.30
L.B.Hansen-Adams Wijk aan Zee 1995
1... ♖ xh4! 2.gxh4 ♗ b8+ 3.f4
Or 3.♔ g2 ♕ g4+.

defenders were too few and far away.
FCM 3.31
Zviagintsev-Wojtkiewicz Tripoli Wch 2004 A critical moment has arrived; White's pieces are optimally posted, and if he can't make progress, he may pay for the weakness of his d- pawn. Only a strong brute force combination can turn the outcome:
1. ♘ xg6! fxg6 2. ♗ xf6 gxf6 3. ♖ h4 ♔ f8
Black falls victim to beautiful mating variations in every line: 3...f5
4.♖ h8+ ♔ g7 5.♕ h7+ ♔ f6 6.♖ f8+ ♔ e5 7.♕ g7+; or 3...e5 4.♖
h8+ ♔ f7 5.♖ xg6! ♖ c7 (5...♔ xg6 6.♕ h5+) 6.♖ g7+! ♔ xg7 7.♕ h7.

9. ♖ g8 1-0
FCM 3.32
Kortchnoi-Grosar Ptuj 1995 In this critical position, White isn't deterred by Black's venomous counterattack, but sees his own play through to mate:
1. ♗ xe6! ♖ b2!
Clearly, all Black's hopes rest on this intermezzo.
2. ♗ xf7+ ♔ g7
Inadequate is 2...♔ h8 3.♕ e6 ♕ xe3 4.♕ f6+ ♗ g7 5.♖ a8+.
3. ♕ e6 ♕ xe3
White can't defend, but he can attack!
4. ♕ f6+ ♔ h6 5. ♕ g5+ ♔ g7 6. ♖ xg6+! ♔ xf7 7. ♕ f5+ ♔ e7 8. ♖ e6+ The
rest is elementary. 1-0
FCM 3.33
Platz-Lampe Halle 1967 Black seems poised to take the offensive, when computer eyes uncork White's brute force idea: a rare 'ideal mate' on an open board:
1. ♕ xf6+!! ♔ xf6 2. ♖ f1+ ♔ e7 3. ♗ g5#
All strong players must shine in precise brute force calculation of positions like this one; just one false move and the counterplay comes raining down.
FCM 3.34
Lalic-Valdes Seville 2003 One assumes that Lalic didn't enter this minefield lightly, but carefully mapped the long road to mate:
1.f6+! ♔ h6 2. ♕ h3+ ♔ g5 3. ♕ g3+ ♔ f5 4. ♕ f4+ ♔ e6 5. ♕ e4+ ♘ e5
The other interpolation ends in mate on the queenside: 5...♗ e5
6.♘ f4+ ♔ d7 7.♕ c6#.
6. ♘ f4+ ♔ f7 7. ♕ d5+ ♔ e8 8. ♕ g8+ ♔ d7 9. ♕ d8#
FCM 3.35
Leko-Kramnik Linares 2004 Inadequate is 1...♕ g7 2.♖ d7!, but the World Champ was ready with a terrible brute force solution:
1... ♕ c2! 2. ♕ xh5 ♕ xe2 3.g4
The white king perishes after 3.g3 ♕ xd1+ 4.♔ g2 ♕ e2+ 5.♔ h3 ♕ f1+ 6.♔ h4 ♕ g2! 7.h3 (else 7...♕ xh2#) 7...♕ xg3.
3... ♕ f2+ 0-1 The edifice crumbles on 4.♔ h1 ♕ xf3+ 5.♔ g1 ♖ xg4+.
FCM 3.36
Aronian-Karpov Hoogeveen 2003 By means of a few simple, well-calculated forcing moves, White's crushing positional edge is converted into decisive mating threats:
1. ♗ xf6 gxf6 2. ♕ e4 ♖ a7 3. ♘ g4! ♔ g7
On 3...f5, 4.♘ f6+ ♔ f8 5.♘ xe8! wins, as does 3...♕ e7 4.♘ xh6+ ♔ g7 5.♕ g4+! ♔ h7 (5...♔ f8 6.♕ g8 or 5...♔ xh6 6.♖ d3) 6.♕ h5 ♔ g7 7.♖ d3 ♖ h8 8.♘ f5+! and mate in two.
4. ♕ e3 ♖ h8 5. ♖ d8! 1-0
The stock diversion sacrifice leads to mate on 5...♖ xd8 6.♕ xh6+ ♔ g8 7.♘ xf6.
FCM 3.37
Bednarski-Adamski Slupsk 1978 White utilizes a combination of stock themes which goes a little beyond the ordinary, and into the realm of fine brute force calculation:
1. ♗ xh7+! ♔ xh7 2. ♖ xf7! ♖ xf7 3. ♖ xf7 ♖ g8
There is no credible defense of g7 (3...♘ xf7 4.♕ xg7#).
4. ♕ h3+ ♔ g6 5. ♕ f5+ ♔ h6 6. ♗ e3+ g5 7. ♕ h7#
FCM 3.38
I.Sokolov-J.Polgar Hoogeveen 2003 White found a long and beautiful brute force win in this sharp position, although, unfortunately, the computer finds a quicker and even more elegant way. Sokolov won beautifully after 1.♖ xe5 ♖ xe5 2.♘ e7!!, but the fantastic 1. ♘ e7!! is much simpler:
1... ♗ b2
Sudden death befalls 1...♖ xf3 2.♕ xe5+; 1...♘ d7 2.♖ xd7!, or 1... ♕ xe7 2.♕ xe7 ♖ xe7 3.♖ xf8.
2. ♖ e5!! ♘ e6
Sadly, the only defense of g7 (2...♖ g8 3.♕ f6+).
3. ♖ xe6 ♖ xf3
Or 3...♖ g8 4.♘ xg8 ♖ xe6 5.♖ f8! ♖ e1+ 4.♔ h2 ♕ c7+ (4...♗ e5+ 5.♕ xe5+!) 5.g3.
4. ♘ g6+ hxg6 5. ♖ xe8+ 1-0
FCM 3.39
Kotov-Yudovich Leningrad 1939 White's activity, and the precariousness of the black king's bunker, cry out for a well-executed sacrificial blow:
1. ♖ f5! exf5
Otherwise a winning check lands on g5: 1...♕ c7 2.♕ g5+ ♔ f8 3.♕ h6+ ♔ e7 4.♕ f6+ ♔ f8 5.♘ xe6+. Probably Black's best defense was the queen sac 1...♕ xd4.
2. ♘ xf5+ ♔ f6
The king is flushed out, due to 2...♕ xf5 3.♕ d6#.
3. ♖ d6+ ♔ xf5 4. ♕ f3+ ♖ f4
Else 5.♕ f6 mates shortly.
5. ♕ h5+ ♔ e4 6. ♗ c2+ ♔ e3 7. ♖ d3+ ♔ f2 8. ♖ d2+ ♔ e1
8...♔ e3 9.♕ e2.

FCM 3.40
Annageldiev-Paramonov Alushta 2004 In this wild and critical position, White unveils an original and well- calculated computer eyes attack:
1. ♗ g8! f5 2. ♗ xe6! ♖ xe6 3. ♕ xf5
Renewing the mate threat on h7.
3... ♘ f6
Straining to defend h7 with the queen on 4.♗ xf6 gxf6, but to no avail.
4. ♘ xe6 ♖ e8 5. ♖ xh6+! ♔ g8
Futile is 5...gxh6 6.♗ xf6+ ♔ g8 7.♕ g6+.
6. ♖ xf6! gxf6 7. ♕ g6+ ♗ g7 8. ♘ xg7 ♖ xe5 9. ♘ h5+ and 10.♕ xe5+
winning the ♖ e5; 1-0 .
FCM 3.41
Adams-Morozevich Dortmund 2001 Another critical situation in which everything rests on precise calculation. White is very active and up material, but after Black's brute force demonstration against the exposed king, all becomes clear within a few moves:
1... ♖ f4! 2. ♕ e3
Black's attack is too strong after 2.♕ xe5 ♕ h4+ 3.♔ g1 ♕ xf2+ 4.♔ h1 ♖ h4+, or 2.♕ xf4 ♗ xf4 3.♗ xc8 (3.♖ xe6 ♕ h4+ 4.♔ g1 ♕ h2+ 5.♔ f1 ♖ xc2!) 3...♕ h4+ 4.♔ g1 ♗ h2+! 5.♔ f1 ♕ c4+.
2... ♖ h4+ 3. ♔ g1 ♗ h2+ 4. ♔ f1 ♗ c4+ 0-1
After all the fireworks comes the simple 5...♕ xb7. C) Promotion-based Brute Force combinations The theme of promotion is a critical element in many brute force combinations, gaining more importance as the battle wears on. Computer eyes are turned up a notch when passers near the queening square.
FCM 3.42
Shirov-Atalik Sarajevo 2004
1. ♖ e6+! ♔ xd7
The pawn queens after 1...♔ xe6 2.♕ e8+.
2. ♖ d2+ 1-0
FCM 3.43
Koblents-Chukaev Soviet Union 1946 In this unlikely setting where White must reckon with 1...♖ g6, the blockaded d-pawn unexpectedly becomes a brute force steamroller:
1. ♖ xf8+! ♔ xf8 2. ♕ c8+ ♔ e7 3. ♕ xc7+ ♖ d7 4.d6+ ♔ e8 5. ♗ xf7+! ♔ xf7
5...♖ xf7 6.♕ c8#.
6. ♕ xd7+ ♔ g6 7. ♕ e8+ ♔ h7 8.d7 1-0
A long line, but absolutely forcing. Computer eyes just had to find the most forcing moves, see the board correctly, and calculate it through!
FCM 3.44
Mamedyarov-Kramnik Moscow 2016 We've already seen how Marauding Majors can spawn a wealth of tactical solutions. Add an advanced passer to the mix and the possibilities are almost unfair:
1. ♖ h8+ ♔ g6 2. ♕ e8+ ♔ f6
Or 2...♗ f7 3.c8♕ .
3. ♕ f8+
There's more than one way to skin the cat, but White takes the practical, clear human approach.
3... ♔ g6 4. ♕ d6! ♖ c6 5.c8 ♕ ! 1-0
FCM 3.45
Prandstetter-Panchenko Czechoslavakia 1978 The terrible threat of making a new queen is rendered even stronger by mating threats, achieved here with the important idea of sacrificing to force promotion with discovered check:
1. ♕ xb6!! ♕ xb6 2. ♖ d7+ ♔ g8
2...♔ e8 3.♖ e7+ ♔ d8 4.♖ d1+.
3.f7+ ♔ h8
The smoke has cleared. Now, have your computer eyes been able to 'see through' and examine one more completely forcing move?
4. ♗ g7+!! ♔ xg7 5.f8 ♕ #
FCM 3.46
Bednarski-Giorgadze Tbilisi 1971 A series of brute force hammer blows culminates in a crushing promotion threat:
1. ♘ e7+! ♘ xe7 2. ♕ xf8+ ♔ xf8 The ♗ b7 falls on 2...♖ xf8 3.fxe7.
3.fxe7+ ♔ e8 4. ♗ xb7 ♖ xb7
Black would win if not for 5. ♖ xf7! , banging home the e-pawn with
6.♖ f8+ (5...♔ xf7 6.e8♕ +). 1-0
Computer eyes are always on alert for the sting at the end of the scorpion's tail! Innumerable battles are decided by analyzing a brute force sequence one move deeper than the opponent. Accurate analysis requires creativity! Lacking bias, computer eyes never rule out underpromotion as a forcing option.
FCM 3.47
Geist-Burrows San Francisco 2000 White played the second-rate 1.♕ xg7+? ♖ xg7 (2.♖ c8+ ♖ g8) and only drew; also not so easy was 1.d8♕ ? ♖ xf1+! 2.♔ xf1 ♕ xe5 3.♕ e7 ♕ f5. The right way, 1.d8 ♘ !! , was lights out: 1... ♕ xe5 2. ♘ f7+ ♔ g7 3. ♘ xe5+ ♔ f6 4. ♘ xf3 1-0 . Beware the wrath of a far-advanced passer blockaded by the king; as in a horror movie, it itches to morph into a new form and deliver mate, if it can only escape confinement!
FCM 3.48
Patience-Tilson England 1964
1. ♕ xd4+!! cxd4 2. ♗ g7+! ♔ xg7
2...♖ xg7 3.♖ xe8 mates.
3. ♖ xe7+ ♖ xe7
3...♔ f6 4.♖ xe8 ♕ g5+ 5.♔ f2 ♕ d2+ 6.♖ e2.
4.h8 ♕ + ♔ f7
As with many promotion combinations, the final phase is a winning king hunt with the marauding major pieces.
5. ♖ h7+ ♔ e6 6. ♕ c8+
Bagging the rook.
6... ♔ f6 7. ♕ f8+ 1-0
Far-advanced passers may control sensitive squares near the enemy king and limit his options.
FCM 3.49
Fischer-Spassky (variation) Sveti Stefan/Belgrade 1992 The seemingly 'doomed' button on e2 exacts its pound of flesh:
1... ♖ xb2!! 2. ♕ xb2 ♕ g1+ 3. ♔ xe2 ♕ h2+ 0-1
FCM 3.50
l'Ami-Wang Hao Wijk aan Zee 2013 In Chapter 10 we'll see brute force analysis at work, determining whether passers can be converted to victory in the ending. Here the far advanced connectors are so strong that White's only hope is to sacrifice his extra piece to contain them, but that idea was quashed by:
1... ♖ d7!
The computer also points out the 'back door' alternative 1...♖ a1+
2.♔ f2 ♖ d1!.
2. ♗ b1
Unfortunately both pieces drop after 2.♗ c2 bxc2 3.♘ xc2 ♖ d1+
4.♔ f2 ♖ d2+.
2... ♖ d1+! 3. ♘ xd1 c2 0-1
It's not surprising then that even middlegame play may revolve around the creation of unstoppable passers:
FCM 3.51
So-Wojtaszek Wijk aan Zee 2017
1. ♘ b3!
The right human choice. Black has a fighting chance after 1.♖ xa4 ♖ xa4 2.♕ xa4 ♕ xc5 3.♗ xb7 e4 and now 4.♖ c1 d3! (4.♖ a1! e3
5.fxe3 dxe3 6.♘ f1! is stronger, but this was hard to evaluate from
the diagram). So correctly guessed that a strong GM couldn't stomach White's 3 to 1 majority, and would try a tactical solution. This he was ready for:
1... ♘ d7?
Black should probably have tried the computer wrinkle 1...a3!? to avoid what happens, but the instinct to actively mobilize was too powerful.
2. ♗ xb7 ♖ ab8 3. ♖ xa4! ♖ xb7 4.c6 ♕ xb4
4...♘ b6 fails to 5.cxb7.
5. ♖ xb4 ♖ c7
Black has the activity he was banking on, but White's mobile passers make too many threats.
6.cxd7 ♖ xc4
If 6...♗ xc4 7.b7 wins, while on 6...♖ 8xd7 simplest is 7.c5 ♗ xb3
8.c6! and the passers roll.
7. ♖ xc4 ♗ xc4 8. ♖ c1 ♗ e6 9. ♖ c8 ♖ xc8 10.dxc8 ♕ + ♗ xc8 11.b6 1-0
Queening combos are more unusual in the opening, and are usually accompanied by great fireworks due to the large number of extant forces:
FCM 3.52
Vaganian-Westerinen Moscow 1982 The unorthodox Finnish GM tried to take the initiative on the c-file instead of making a routine recapture on the previous move. The point is 1.cxb7 ♖ xc3 2.b8♕ +?? ♖ c8+, winning the queen with the discovery. But Black gets burned by playing with the dangerous fire of a passer on the 7th rank:
1.cxb7! ♖ xc3
In the game Westerinen saw what was coming, played 1...♖ b8 and lost anyway.
2. ♕ a4+!! ♕ xa4 3.b8 ♕ +
The new queen is better placed than the old, and wreaks decisive havoc! The coming bishop check is crushing.
3... ♖ c8
Black jumps from the fryer into the fire with 3...♔ d7 4.♗ b5+ ♔ e6
5.♘ g5#.

Ex 3.2 Taimanov-Kuzminikh Soviet Union 1950
1. ♘ g6 White begins with a stock threat on h8 with the knight
obviously being taboo (1...fxg6 2.♗ xe6+). The creative application of brute force analysis comes after the forced reply 1... ♘ h7 2. ♖ xe6 fxe6 3. ♕ xd8+!! ♕ xd8 4. ♗ xe6# ! Ex 3.3 Videki-Mansurov Budapest 1994

Maybe Fritz could find it in his sleep. All Black's moves were among the most forcing, which made the selection process a bit easier. Ex 3.4 Benjamin-Seirawan Seattle 2000 The American GM identifies the critical position, with Black on the verge of equalizing, and brings him down with a far-reaching brute force combo winning decisive material: 1. ♘ xe6! fxe6 If 1...♖ e8 2.♖ d8+! ♖ xd8 (2...♕ xd8 3.♕ c4+) 4.♘ xc7. 2. ♕ xe6+ ♖ d7 2...♔ b8

1... ♖ d8 2. ♘ c6! ♕ c5 3. ♘ xd8 ♕ xb5 Or 3...♗ xb5 4.♖ xf7. Black
hopes to embarrass the oddly placed white knight, but it seems quite happy attacking from the heart of enemy headquarters! 4. ♕ a8! ♔ e7

Ex 3.6 Lahno-Jobava Dubai 2004 Too slow is 1...♗ c2 2.♗ c4! f5 3.♖ xc2!, so Black must use brute force to punch White's ticket: 1... ♘ xc3! 2. ♗ c4 2.♘ xc3 ♕ b4; 2.♖ xc3 ♖ d1+ 3.♔ b2 ♖ b1#; or 2.♕ a5 ♖ xa2+. 2... ♘ xb5 3. ♕ e3 A feverish attempt to avoid 3.♗ xb5 ♕ b4 4.♖ b1 ♕ c3+. 3... ♗ d3!

These positions are so devilish that even former WC Candidates can step on their swords:

CHAPTER 4
Surprise forcing moves Study material In the first three chapters we focused on recognition of stock forcing moves and the use of brute force calculation. In the remaining chapters, we examine the other key aspect of developing strong computer eyes: overcoming human bias . We begin with surprise forcing moves. The most basic human chess bias is our tendency to rely on 'normal' moves, and to rule out 'impossible' or strange ideas. On the one hand, this shows a deficit of creativity; but from a 'computer eyes' perspective, it also demonstrates a lack of objectivity, since unusual forcing moves are often the best! Computers lack human sensibilities which label a move abnormal, so they calculate surprise moves and normal moves equally, without bias. Since humans do have a need to categorize positions and weed some options out (we don't have the computer's luxury of analyzing every move!), we must make a special effort to develop the capacity to find strong surprise forcing moves in our games. Many great attackers make a practice of considering 'impossible' moves first , to ensure that they don't overlook the shocker which might be the key to the position. Since opponents also neglect these surprise options in their calculations, mastering this key feature of computer eyes will translate into better results, as well as a heightened appreciation for the possibilities hidden in 'everyday' positions. In the previous chapter, we discussed the three essential skills involved in calculating forcing chess moves: selection, board sight, and raw calculation of variations. Surprise forcing moves are of primary importance in the area of improving your selection skills . The two cardinal sins of selection bear repeating:
1. Failure to consider crucial forcing options during your
calculations. If this is your problem, then the following chapters are the remedy. You must start by 'reprogramming' to be extra alert on the surprise forcing moves that you tend to discard.
2. Spending too much time on 'dead ends'. This becomes a
serious problem if you are chronically addicted to the disease of time pressure. The remedy for this one is more difficult, since you don't want to 'throw out the baby with the bath water' and stunt your creativity. Much of this 'HONING ' skill will come from experience and the study of master tactics, but a good start at this point would be to heighten your practice of always examining the most forcing moves first . The surprise moves in this chapter all share the trait of being extremely forcing; as such, they are precisely not the types of options you want to 'filter out' of your calculations. We will distinguish two types of surprise forcing moves: A) 'Impossible' moves B) Unusual squares and 'Antipositional' surprise forcing moves The term 'UNUSUAL SQUARES ' refers to surprise invasions which occur on a square not usually associated with a particular piece. Rote thinking often wrongly ignores these strange forcing options. 'ANTIPOSITIONAL ' forcing moves are the kind of 'ugly' forcing shots computers thrive on. They may look like 'the worst moves on the board' to human eyes, until brute force analysis shows that they win by force! Typical 'antipositional' shots include moves which destroy one's own pawn structure, or trap one's own piece(s), until one grasps the tactical justification which overrides these positional considerations. A) 'Impossible' surprise forcing moves These are the elemental 'bolts from the blue' that catch the opponent completely off guard, with devastating impact. They typically involve major material sacrifices. The quintessential surprise forcing move is the 'jaw dropper', a move so unlikely that it is often completely overlooked by the opponent.
FCM 4.1
Bischoff-Nogueiras Havana 1998 I'm guessing that Black was pretty happy with his chances here, since 1.g6? is met by the winning countershot 1...♖ a1+! 2.♗ xa1 ♕ a2+. But White struck first with an unbelievable 'barn burner':
1. ♕ xh7+!!! ♕ xh7+
Or 1...♔ xh7 2.g6+ ♔ g8 3.h7+.
2.g6 ♗ a2+ 3. ♔ c1 1-0 After the shock of a lifetime, it's hard to blame
Black for resigning a little prematurely; he could still resist with 3...♖ a7! 4.gxh7+ ♔ xh7 5.♖ g7+ ♖ xg7 6.hxg7+ ♔ g6 with slim holding chances.
FCM 4.2
Zilber-Tal (variation) Riga 1958 The main justification of another brilliantly speculative Tal piece sacrifice was the shocker 1... ♕ h3+ , envisioning an unusual version of the stock fork trick 2. ♔ g1 ♕ h1+ 3. ♔ xh1 ♘ xf2+ 4. ♔ g2 ♘ xd3 , regaining the piece with a winning edge. 0-1
FCM 4.3
Kasparov-Smirin Moscow 1988 It's hard to believe that White could be winning here, down a piece and pawn, with an exposed king and Black threatening 1...♕ c5+ and 2...♖ c1, but Kasparov's bombshell reveals that he has the whole position in hand:
1. ♖ xh6!! ♗ xh6
Otherwise 2.♗ e6 is mate.
2. ♗ e6+ ♔ h8
2...♔ g7 3.♕ f7+.
3. ♕ f6+
As we noted earlier, such positions with many checking possibilities require careful brute force calculation. 3...♗ g7 now loses to 4.♕ h4+.
3... ♔ h7 4. ♕ f7+ ♗ g7
Or 4...♔ h8 5.♕ g8#. Finally all becomes clear.
5. ♗ f5+ ♔ h8 6. ♕ h5+ ♔ g8 7. ♗ e6+ ♔ f8 8. ♕ f7#
A stunning display of Kasparovian prowess.
FCM 4.4
Vetemaa-Shabalov Haapsalu 1986 Black's initiative is even stronger than White's imposing center, but White hopes to fight on after 1...♘ xc3 2.bxc3 ♕ a4 3.♔ b2!. The other magician from Latvia has something much more devilish in mind:
1... ♕ b5!!
A monstrous surprise forcing shot.
2. ♖ d2 The queen is taboo due to 3.♘ b3#, while 2.b4 loses
prosaically to 2...♘ b3+ 3.♗ xb3 ♖ xc3+.
2... ♘ xc3 3. ♕ xc3
3.bxc3 ♕ b1# or 3.♗ xb5 ♘ b3#.
3... ♘ b3+ 0-1 . The c-file pin proves decisive.
FCM 4.5
Fischer-Sherwin New York 1957 Losing is 1.♖ xf7 ♖ c1+ 2.♖ f1+?? ♔ h8, but with Fischer's unique ability to penetrate positions with searing objectivity, he wasn't quite ready to give up on this critical forcing line:
1. ♖ xf7! ♖ c1+ 2. ♕ f1!
A marvelous feat of creative selection! The doomed queen enables mate after 2...♖ fc8 3.♖ f8#, while 2...♖ xf1+ 3.♖ xf1+ ♕ xd5 4.♖ xf8+ wins.
2...h5 3. ♕ xc1 ♕ h4
3...♕ xc1+ loses a rook to 4.♖ f1+.
4. ♖ xf8+ 1-0
Before computers, only Fischer-like genius could conceive a move like 2.♕ f1!.
FCM 4.6
Andres Rodriguez-Leon Hoyos Buenos Aires 2003 In desperate situations, most of us don computer eyes and suddenly become eager to analyze any 'crazy possibility', searching for some loophole to escape imminent death. What if we could be so alert to the 'impossible' all the time? White's position looks resignable here, but it was Black who had to throw in the towel after 1. ♖ d7+! ♔ xd7 (1...♔ b6 2.♕ c5#) 2. ♘ c5+ ♔ c7 3. ♘ xe6+ fxe6 4. ♕ xf4+ 1-0 .
FCM 4.7
Tiviakov-Beshukov Elista 1996 White's pieces are perfectly poised for attack, but he could soon be forced into an awkward defense of the e4 weakness. Also, Black may try to complicate with 1...f5!? (threatening ...f5-f4) and if 2.exf5 ♗ d5+ and 3...♖ xg7. White's quiet prelude masks a surprise crusher which resolves all these issues:
1. ♕ h6! ♕ c6
'Falling for it', but there's no reasonable answer to the coming blow; if 1...♖ dd8 2.♖ xf7 wins on the spot.
2. ♗ g6!! 1-0 Checkmate on h7, f8, or h8!
FCM 4.8
Riumin-Rauzer Odessa 1929 In this clearly critical position, Black foresaw a run of 'impossible' forcing moves deciding the battle:
1...f3!!
A triumph of selection! Computer eyes can't reject a forcing option solely due to abstract thoughts like 'it drops a pawn three ways!'. Like Fritz, we should strive to analyze first, then make generalizations!
2. ♗ xf3
Forced, to stop mate on h2.
2... ♘ xe4!
Definitely not rote play! 3.♗ xh5 ♘ f2+ 4.♔ g1 ♘ h3# is a stock mate; and h2 or the queen fall on 3.♗ xe4 ♖ xf1+!.
3.dxe4 ♖ xf3! 4. ♖ xf3 ♖ xe4! 0-1
White's defenses are ripped to shreds after 5.♕ f2 ♕ xf3+! (or also
5...♖ xe1+! 6.♗ xe1 ♗ c5!) 6.♕ xf3 ♖ xe1+ 7.♗ xe1 ♗ xf3+; 5.♘
e3 ♖ xe3!, or 5.♖ f8+ ♔ xf8 6.♕ xh5 (6.♕ f2+ ♖ f4+) 6...♖ xe1#.
FCM 4.9
Nezhmetdinov-Kasparian Riga 1955 The legendary tactician Rashid Nezhmetdinov was Tal's nemesis, one of the few who could match the wizard from Riga's creativity in the attack: 1. ♗ e6!! An astounding conception, leading to a stunning breakthrough despite Black's wealth of possible replies.
1... ♖ h8+
Forced, to forestall the attack. White breaks through after 1...♖ xf2+
2.♕ xf2 ♕ xe5 (2...♕ xe6 3.♕ f8+ ♔ xg6 4.♖ f6+) 3.♕ f7+ ♔ h6
4.♕ h7+ ♔ g5 5.♕ xe7+.
2. ♗ h3!
A wonderful feat of selection. It was exceptionally hard to discern the strength of this paradoxical, forced move. The black rook has been forced off the f-file, but it is far from clear whose threats are stronger.
2... ♘ xg6?!
Black appears to hold after 2...♖ d3! 3.♖ f7+ ♔ g8 4.♖ f8+ ♔ g7
5.♖ 1f7+ ♔ xg6 6.♖ xh8 ♕ xf7 with a small advantage for White.
3. ♖ f7+ ♔ h6
More tenacious was 3...♕ xf7 4.♖ xf7+ ♔ xf7 5.♕ f5+ (amazingly, White must avoid 5.♕ f2+? ♘ f4!!, equalizing after 6.gxf4 - Black even wins after 6.♕ xd4?? ♖ xh3 and 6...♖ d3) 5...♔ g7 6.♕ f6+ ♔ h6 7.♗ f5 ♖ g8 8.e6, but White is still winning. position after 3...♔ h6 The critical position. White would even lose with the 'natural' 4.♖ 1f2? ♖ d1 5.♗ g2? ♔ g5+!. Rashid's remarkable computer eyes are revealed by a second jaw-dropping surprise dagger:
4. ♕ xg6+!!
The rest is forced!
4... ♔ xg6 5. ♖ 1f6+ ♔ g5 6. ♖ f5+ ♔ g6 7. ♖ 7f6+ ♔ h7
7...♔ g7 8.♖ g5+ transposes.
8. ♖ h5+ ♔ g7 9. ♖ g5+ ♔ h7 10. ♗ f5#
FCM 4.10
Tal-NN Soviet Union 1964 When the enemy position hangs by a thread, any and all forcing moves need to be tried. Very promising was 1.♕ f8+ ♔ f6 2.♗ d4+, but for simplicity one can't argue with Tal's shocking 1. ♗ b6!! , initiating a decisive 'checking circuit' by the white queen:
1... ♕ xb6
1...axb6 2.♕ d8#.
2. ♕ h4+ ♖ f6
2...f6 3.♕ h7+.
3. ♕ xb4+ 1-0
FCM 4.11
Lalic-Schekachev Metz 1998 Master computer eyes sense that White is too underdeveloped here, and radical ideas may be justified:
1... ♗ h3! 2. ♖ g1
The sudden assault on the king is unstoppable. 2...♗ xg2+ with 3... ♕ f2+ was threatened, and neither 2.gxh3 ♕ xd5+ 3.♖ e4 (3.♔ g1 ♗ c5+) 3...♖ f1+ 4.♔ g2 (4.♘ xf1 ♕ xe4+ 5.♔ g1 ♗ c5+) 4...♖ xc1! (or also 4...♖ af8!) 5.♖ xc1 ♕ xd2+ 6.♔ g3 (6.♔ f3 ♖ f8+) 6... ♗ d6+, nor 2.♕ d1 ♖ f2 3.gxh3 ♗ xd2 offer any hope.
2... ♖ ae8!
Bringing up the reserves with tempo via the pernicious threat 3...♕ xg1+! with a stock double rook mate.
3. ♘ f3 ♗ xg2+ 4. ♖ xg2
4.♔ xg2 ♕ g4+.
4... ♖ e1+ 0-1 Mate follows shortly after 5.♘ g1 ♖ xg1+ 6.♖ xg1 ♕
e4+.
FCM 4.12
Apicella-Bauer Aix-les-Bains 2003 Black was prepared to refute the crude 1.♕ h5?? by 1...♕ e4+ and
2...♖ h8, but not for the jaw dropper 1. ♗ xg5!! ♗ xg5 2. ♕ f6+!! ♗ xf6
3. ♖ g3+ and mate; 1-0 .
FCM 4.13
Najer-Bocharov Elista 2000 When time is more crucial than material, surprise forcing moves often appear as DEFLECTION SHOTS whose sole purpose is to gain a tempo for the attack:
1.exf7+! ♔ xf7 2. ♗ xa6!!
Allowing the queen to join battle with crushing effect.
2... ♖ xa6 3. ♕ h5+ ♔ g8
Black cannot survive 3...g6 4.♕ xh7+ or 3...♔ f8 4.♘ e6+.
4. ♕ xe8+ 1-0
Black's hapless forces are massacred after 4...♗ f8 5.♗ d6, or 4... ♘ f8 5.♗ g5! ♖ a7 6.♕ f7+ ♔ h8 7.♕ xf8+.
FCM 4.14
Abrahams-Thynne Liverpool 1936 Black was ready for the normal 1.♕ h8+? ♔ e7, but was caught off guard by a far more potent option:
1. ♕ g8+!
Would you foresee such a fresh candidate move? If not, you must work on your creative selection of forcing options. The assault on f7 swings the game.
1... ♔ e7
1...♔ xg8 2.♘ g6! with a stock mate on h8.
2. ♕ xf7+ ♔ d8 3. ♖ d1+ ♗ d7 4. ♘ g6 ♕ xb2?
A blunder in a hopeless position.
5. ♕ xe8+ 1-0
FCM 4.15
Vasiukov-Taimanov Tallinn 1965 White neatly refutes the threat on g4 with an 'impossible' move winning material:
1. ♘ f6
Stomp.
1... ♔ xf6 2. ♕ f3+ 1-0
FCM 4.16
Van Wely-Sammour Hasboun New York 1994 The illusion of a finely balanced theoretical slugfest is shattered by a thunderbolt:
1. ♕ d6+ 1-0
1...♔ xd6 falls to 2.♘ xc4+, while if 1...♔ e8 2.♕ b8+ picks off the
bishop with check; or 1...♔ f6 2.♖ f1+ and 3.♗ xb7.
FCM 4.17
Spielmann-Duras San Sebastian 1911 Black's defenses hang by a thread, but it looks like a very strong thread! Any normal pin-breaking moves (♔ h1, ♔ h3, ♕ f4) allow
1...♕ xh6, mating! Still, the bishop+rook battery is so menacing that
good selection requires examining every forcing move, however unlikely...
1. ♕ g3!! ♕ xh6+
Not 1...♖ xg3 2.♖ xe8#.
2. ♕ h3 ♕ d6
Otherwise the mate threat on e8 costs Black at least a bishop. But now the pin can be broken without allowing mate:
3. ♔ h1! 1-0
FCM 4.18
Djukic-Gipslis (variation) Vrnjacka Banja 1975 Black's unusual defensive posting of the ♖ h5 makes it hard to break through by usual means, but...
1. ♗ xg6! fxg6 2. ♕ xe6!!
My friend Michael Dathe calls such moves 'leading with your jaw'. This triumphant creative selection wins on the spot; both bishops are attacked, and 2...♗ xe6 3.♘ xe6+ wins easily; 1-0 .
FCM 4.19
Sadvakasov-Korotylev Moscow 2003 By their very nature, surprise forcing moves may occur in any situation, but they certainly play a vital role in prosecuting attacks, when routine moves are often simply too slow, and too easily foreseen by the defender. Creativity rules!
1. ♖ h5!
Breathing fire into the attack, as the variations show: 1...♕ xe5 2.♘ h6+; 1...♖ xe5 2.♖ h8+!; 1...gxf5 2.♕ g5+ ♔ f8 3.♖ h8#.
1...f6 2. ♕ g1!
The 'forcing retreat' avoids a pinned e-pawn (after 2.♕ g3) and quickly breaks Black's fortress. The same could have been achieved by 2.♕ h6!.
2...g5
2...♕ f7 3.♘ h6+.
3.exf6 Or also 3.♖ xg5+!. 1-0
FCM 4.20
Spassky-Fischer Siegen 1970 Clearly White's attack is very strong, but the placement of Black's defenders isn't too slouchy, either. It takes a little surprise move to tip the apple cart:
1. ♖ e8+ ♔ f7 2. ♖ f8+! 1-0 After 2...♔ xf8, 3.♕ h8+ unpins the ♘ d5.
Computer eyes should note that even with the black queen on b7, the 100% forcing 2.♖ f8+ would still work due to the stock skewering idea 2...♔ xf8 3.♕ h8+ ♔ f7 4.♕ xh7+. Naturally, surprise forcing moves are also critical in sharp opening positions:
FCM 4.21
Sangla-Karpov Riga 1968
1...g5! White soon resigned after this unusual spike, since 2...g4 is
threatened, but after 2. ♗ xg5 ♗ xd2+ (or 2...♘ xg5 3.♘ xg5 ♗ xd2+
4.♔ xd2 ♕ a5+) 3. ♘ xd2 ♕ a5 (but not 3...♘ xg5? 4.h4) attacks two
pieces and wins cleanly. 0-1 Computer eyes are essential to finding the right path in positions where missing a surprise resource could lead to rejecting the winning line! (see fragment next page)
FCM 4.22
Fedoseev-Vitiugov Satka ch-RUS 2018 White found the forcing idea 1. ♗ xh5+! ♔ xh5 2. ♖ f7! when Black went down quietly after 2...♔ g4 3.♖ xe7 ♖ b2+ 4.♔ g1, but the real challenge was foreseeing the 'invisible move' after 2... ♖ xb2+ 3. ♔ h3! ♕ e6+ :
4. ♖ f5+!! with the deep tactical point 4... ♔ g6 5. ♕ g5+ ♔ h7 6. ♕ h5+
♔ g7 7. ♕ g4+ unpinning the rook with an easy win, 1-0 .
FCM 4.23
Sherzer-Mathe Hungary 1989 In this now-or-never position White had foreseen a fantastic surprise forcing move:
1. ♕ g5+!! ♗ xg5 2.hxg5+ ♔ xh5 3.g4#
FCM 4.24
Anand-Mamedyarov Wijk aan Zee 2019 By all appearances Black seems happy as a clam, with active rooks on half-open files, full development and long-term pressure against the 'ugly' backward c2-pawn. But White has not neglected the shocking surprise resource which turns the whole game on its head; incredibly Black lasts only 10 more moves!
1.c4!! ♖ xc4
Black can't even bail out with 1...♘ e7 2.cxd5 ♘ xd4 3.♖ xd5! exd5
4.♕ xd5+ ♔ h8 5.e6 ♗ e8? 6.♕ xd8 ♖ xd8 7.e7.
2. ♖ xd5! ♖ f7 3. ♖ d3 g4
This pawn sac doesn't ease Black's problems, but appears as good as anything. If 3...h6 4.♘ bd2 ♖ b4 (trying to stay active) 5.♖ c1, suddenly the white rooks, which looked so dormant, control the board. The reader has no doubt experienced the psychological impact of a strong surprise move, which can't be overstated. The world-class attacker Mamedyarov does not want to be slowly ground down by an all-time great, so he errs on the side of overactivity:
4. ♘ fd2 ♖ b4 5.hxg4 ♘ e7 6. ♘ f3 ♘ d5 7. ♘ bd4 ♖ f4? 8. ♘ c2! +- ♖ be4
9. ♖ xd5! exd5 10. ♕ xd5+ 1-0
Black has seen enough - the sequel could be 10...♔ f8 11.♖ d1 ♔ e8 12.♘ g5 ♕ xg5 13.♕ d7+ ♔ g8 14.♕ c8+ etc. B) Unusual squares and 'Antipositional' surprise forcing moves Some surprise forcing moves are particularly elusive because they happen on strange squares, or look just plain ugly. We learn to 'weed out' these awkward-looking moves as we become more 'sophisticated' players. But surprise moves are all about CREATIVE SELECTION , and creativity requires lack of bias; is this the exceptional position where the weird or ugly move represents the truth?
FCM 4.25
Gheorghiu-Wirthensohn Biel 1982 This trap in the English has occurred often, since who would even think of trading the light-squared bishop with white? The powerful Romanian GM played the 'normal' 1.♗ b2, but 1. ♗ xd5! would have won a piece: 1... ♗ xd5 2.e3 ♘ e6 3.e4! 1-0 .
FCM 4.26
Caruana-Naiditsch Wijk aan Zee 2014 Attacks on unexpected squares can have a human impact far outweighing their theoretical value. Strong players are almost invincible when they feel in control of a stable position with concrete trumps. White has a better structure, and expects to win the positional struggle by undermining the dangerous ♘ d3. In engineland Black's shocking resource only changes the assessment from a slight white edge to equality. But in flesh and blood combat White's prized equilibrium is destroyed, and the course of the battle turned upside down:
1... ♘ b2!!
Who would even think of such a strange move? The answer: a player with computer eyes. The nature of the position is transformed by Black's establishing his own trump, a strong advanced passer on c3. Now if 2.bxc4? ♘ xc4 and 3...♘ de3 wins the exchange, while on 2.♖ fc1 c3 3.♖ xc3 ♘ xc3 4.♖ xc3 ♖ d8 Black has equalizing counterplay.
2. ♘ e5!? c3 3. ♕ f2 ♖ d8
Black has achieved his goal of completely destabilizing the position, and White must find the difficult 4.♗ f3 or 4.♕ g1 just to stay equal. Having lost control, he now loses the thread completely and blunders:
4. ♖ e1? ♘ xf4! -+ 5.gxf4 ♖ xd4 6. ♖ xc3 ♘ d1!
Another strong invasion on an unexpected square.
7. ♖ c7+ ♔ g8 8. ♕ c2 ♖ dxf4!
Threatening 9...♖ f1+!.
9. ♖ xb7 ♘ f2+ 10. ♔ g1 ♘ h3+ 11. ♔ h1 ♖ f1+ 0-1
FCM 4.27
Graf-Georgiev Recklinghausen 1998 White executes an 'IDEAL MATE ' on a quite unusual square:
1. ♖ c8+! ♖ xc8 2. ♕ h8+ ♔ e7 3. ♘ xc8#
FCM 4.28
Dzindzichashvili-Browne New York 1984 Black covers the critical squares, and on the normal 1.♗ f4 plans to untangle with 1...♕ f5! 2.f3 ♗ d5. But the super-talented 'Dzin' doesn't stop at 'normal' ideas!
1. ♗ b8!! With twin crushing threats: 2.f3, or 2.♖ xe4 ♕ xe4 3.♕ g8+
♔ h6 4.♕ h8+ ♕ h7 5.♕ xf6+.
1... ♕ e8 2. ♖ xe4! ♕ xb8 3. ♖ e5!
Finally occupying the critical squares.
3...fxe5 4. ♕ g6+ ♔ h8 5. ♕ h6+ ♖ h7 6. ♕ f6+ 1-0
FCM 4.29
Richter-Kahn Prague 1931 By now the reader should have no trouble finding the first move that needs to be considered here:
1. ♕ h6+! ♖ xh6
If 1...♔ e7, 2.♘ g8+! ♖ xg8 3.♗ g5+ f6 4.exf6+ ♔ f7 5.♕ h7+ ♔ f8
6.♗ h6 mates.
2. ♗ xh6+ ♔ e7
But did you foresee the pretty finale on the unusual square 3. ♘ g8# ?
FCM 4.30
Akimov-Pridorozhni St Petersburg 2000 There is a human tendency to forget that castling may also be a forcing move on occasion:
1. ♕ xd8+! ♔ xd8 2.O-O-O+
The pin on the knight is thus broken with tempo.
2... ♕ d3 3. ♖ xd3+ ♗ xd3 4. ♖ d1 1-0
Can you find White's unusual forking square, based on the looseness of Black's rooks?
FCM 4.31
Botvinnik-Sarov Soviet Union 1928
1. ♘ f6+! ♔ h8 2. ♘ e8! 1-0
The mate threat on g7 wins the exchange.
FCM 4.32
Pedzich-Murdzia Swidnica 1999 With all White's forces trained on f7 (1.♘ f7 and if 1...♗ e7 2.♕ f3 is in fact winning), Black did not expect the winning shot to come on a different square:
1. ♖ xd6! ♕ xd6 2. ♗ h7+!
More forcing than 2.♗ f7+ ♔ f8 3.♗ e8! (rather than 3.♘ g6+?! ♔ xf7 4.♘ e5+ ♔ e7 5.♖ d1 ♕ xd1+) and Black is still fighting on.
2... ♔ xh7
2...♖ xh7 3.♕ f7+ ♔ h8 4.♘ g6+ is also mate.
3. ♕ g6+ ♔ g8 4. ♕ f7+ ♔ h7 5. ♖ xh6+! ♔ xh6 6. ♕ g6#
FCM 4.33
Sturua-Xu Jun Istanbul 2000 White is down a piece and his 'incarcerated' ♗ h7 looks ugly, but well-developed GM computer eyes have discerned that this bishop is in fact ideally placed for the coming breakthrough!
1.e6! fxe6
Even pitching the ♗ f8 first doesn't help: 1...♗ g7 2.♗ xg7 fxe6 (2... ♗ xe6 3.♗ f6+ ♔ f8 4.♕ h6#) 3.♗ f6+ ♔ f7 4.♗ g8+! ♖ xg8 (4...♔ xg8 5.♕ h8+ ♔ f7 6.♕ g7#) 5.♕ h7+ ♔ f8 6.♕ e7#.
2. ♗ f6+ ♔ f7 3. ♗ g8+! ♔ xg8 4. ♕ h8+ ♔ f7 5. ♕ h7+ ♗ g7 6. ♕ xg7#
FCM 4.34
Vyzhmanavin-Nikolenko Moscow 1987 White is down an awful lot of material, and the obvious forcing moves are dead-ends. But an awkward-looking slow move, sacrificing both minor pieces, wins in all variations:
1. ♘ f6!!
Threatening 2.♕ h5+ ♔ g7 3.♕ h7#.
1... ♕ xe7
Also losing are 1...♖ xf6 2.♕ xf6+ ♔ h7 3.♕ f7+ ♔ h6 4.♗ g5+, or
1...♖ xe7 2.♘ xd7 ♖ xd7 3.♕ g4+.
2. ♕ h5+ ♔ g7 3. ♕ h7+ ♔ xf6
3...♔ f8 4.♕ g8#.
4. ♕ h6# A great feat of imagination!
FCM 4.35

Ex 4.12 Sherzer-Collier Virginia 1991 A 'shot from left field' provides the needed tempo to culminate White's mating attack: 1. ♘ b5!! ♗ xb5 2.fxg6 fxg6 Black is always a move too slow, e.g. 2...hxg6 3.♖ xf6! ♕ xc2 (3...♖ be8 4.♕ h6 ♕ xc2 5.♖ h3 (5.♖ xg6+! also mates) 5...♕ b1+ 6.♗ c1) 4.♖ xg6+! fxg6 5.♗ e6+ ♖ f7 6.♗ xf7+ ♔ xf7 7.♕ h7+ ♔ f8 (7...♔ e6 8.♕ e7#) 8.♖ f3+. 3. ♗ e6+ ♖ f7 On 3...♔ h8 comes the picturesque stock queen sac 4.♕ xh7+! ♔ xh7 5.♖ h3+ ♔ g7 6.♗ h6+ ♔ h7

Ex 4.13 Ftacnik-Cvitan Germany Bundesliga 1997/98 In such positions, one must 'smell a rat' and expect a surprise, since Black can't survive unless he lands a decisive blow. 1... ♗ xg2+! 2. ♔ xg2 White's plan is to happily give back a rook and stave off mate after 2...♘ g5 3.♔ h1! ♕ h3 4.♖ f2 ♘ h4 5.♗ f1, but Black has a more forcing improvement in store, which you may have anticipated after reading Chapter 1: 2... ♕ h3+!! 3. ♔ xh3 3.♔ h1 g2#. 3... ♘ g5+ 4. ♔ g2 ♘ h4+ 5. ♔ h1 g2# Ex 4.14 Illescas Cordoba-Yermolinsky Madrid 1998 Surprise moves are commonplace when there is no room for half- measures: 1.g6! hxg6 2. ♖ g1!

Not 7.♔ f2?? ♕ f4+!, but now Black can safely resign in view of 7...♕ b1+ 8.♔ f2 ♕ b2+ 9.♖ c2; 1-0 . Ex 4.15 Tal-Olafsson Las Palmas 1975 He who lives by the shot must sometimes die by it! White's back rank seems amply covered, but after 1... ♕ f4!! there was no answer to the threats 2...♖ xe4 and 2...♗ xf3. White tried 2. ♖ e7! to escape after 2...♖ xd2? 3.♖ xe8+ and 4.♘ xd2, but after 2... ♖ f8! there was still no recourse: 3. ♕ e2 ♗ xf3 4. ♕ xf3 4.gxf3 ♕ g5+ spears a rook. 4... ♕ d6! The winning FORCING RETREAT , double-attacking the rook and the back rank; 0-1 . Ex 4.16 Parma-Fischer (variation) Bled 1961 Sometimes it takes one last surprise forcing move to cap a winning combination: 1. ♖ g3+ ♔ h7 2. ♗ g6+! ♔ g7 If 2...fxg6, 3.♖ xg6 mates on h6. So far so good, but where's the win? 3. ♗ h7+!! This unusual placement diverts Black from the defense of the h-pawn and forces mate after 3...♔ xh7 4.♖ h3; 1-0 . Ex 4.17 Bonin-Kamsky New York m (rapid) 2004 Surprise blows abound in rapid and blitz play: 19.e6! won outright thanks to the fork threat 20.♘ e5, and the brute force sequence that follows: 19... ♕ xd6 20.exf7+ ♔ g7 21. ♖ d2 ♕ f6 On 21...♕ c7, 22.♕ a1+! is embarrassing. 22. ♖ d8 ♖ xd8 23. ♕ xd8 ♕ xf7 Or 23...♔ xf7

Ex 4.18 Kuchta-Honfi correspondence game, 1956 'IMPOSSIBLE MOVES ' must always be considered, not only for creativity's sake, but because they will often elude your opponent, even in correspondence play (admittedly, this is less likely now that most postal players have literal 'computer eyes!').

This was a trademark of Kasparov, arguably the greatest attacker ever. His calculations were so deep and accurate that the surprise was often indefensible by the time the defender saw it coming. 1.d5!! Amazingly, the passed c-pawn can't be stopped. 1... ♘ xe5 2. ♗ xe5 cxd5 3.c6 f5 4.gxf6 gxf6 5. ♗ e6+ ♔ g7 6. ♗ g3 ♗ xa3 7. ♗ xd5 The passer and 'laser bishops' are so strong that White can afford a detour to pick off a pawn. 7... ♖ c8 8.c7 ♗ c5 9. ♗ b7 1-0
CHAPTER 5
Equal or Stronger Threats (EST's) Study material Last chapter we examined perhaps the most common human bias, the tendency to look only at 'normal moves' and overlook the surprise forcing moves which often decide games. In this chapter we turn our attention to another very harmful type of bias, the 'KNEE-JERK DEFENSIVE RESPONSE '. You can see this bias very clearly in beginners; when their queen is attacked, they immediately reach to move it, as if all other moves were suddenly outlawed! But even the strongest players are sometimes guilty of automatic defensive responses. I have a very practical suggestion that will teach you to overcome this bias. When analysis shows that the opponent has a concrete threat, no matter how strong, you must learn to first ask yourself, 'Can I create an Equal or Stronger Threat?' . Asking yourself this simple question consistently during games will help you find many more winning forcing moves, and change the way you think about positions. The presence of an EST (we will use this abbreviation to save space) does not mean that it is the best move; as with any other forcing move, further analysis may show that it loses. However, like other forcing moves, EST's should be analyzed first before settling for defensive measures. Equal or stronger threats have both strategic and tactical advantages. Strategically, all things being equal, it is preferable to promote your own plan, versus responding to the opponent's agenda. When you are prosecuting an attack, every tempo is precious, and finding an EST that keeps the momentum going may be the difference between forcing a win and allowing consolidation. But even in 'innocuous' or unclear positions, it is crucial to stay in the habit of checking for equal or stronger threats first, rather than assuming that the opponent's threat must be stopped. A well-placed EST often changes the course of the battle. Tactically, equal or stronger threats are often demonstrably the strongest moves in a given position, and are a critical component of computer eyes, as Stockfish continually demonstrates. When computers shock us with completely unexpected moves, they are often of this variety: moves that ignore our threat completely, then demonstrate 2-3 moves hence that our apparent threat was irrelevant, as the position had already slipped away. In this chapter we will consider two basic types of EQUAL OR STRONGER
THREATS :
A) Attacking EST's : These equal or stronger threats ignore the opponent's threat, in the service of continuing one's own attack without loss of time. Bread and butter for the attacker, these creative forcing moves may deny the enemy the one necessary tempo to consolidate and turn back the onslaught. The key theme is keeping the initiative . B) Momentum-changing EST's : These are EST's which turn seemingly unclear positions decisively in one side's favor. At times they may even turn the tables, revealing that the apparent 'defender' is in fact winning by force. A) Attacking Equal or Stronger Threats
FCM 5.1
J.van Foreest-Nepomniachtchi Wijk aan Zee 2019 We aren't exaggerating here when we call exchanging queens a threat, since White's strategic advantage in king safety would disappear, with a probable draw. Instead a golden EST gives White a winning initiative:
1.h6!! ♕ xg6
The stunning point is White's mating attack after 1...♕ xg2 (1...gxh6
2.♖ 1h6 mates) 2.hxg7+! ♔ xg6 (2...♕ xh1 3.g8♕ # or 2...♔ g8
3.♖ h8+) 3.g8♕ + ♗ g7 4.♖ h6+ ♔ f5 5.♕ f7+ ♔ e5 6.♕ f4+ ♔ d5
7.♖ xd6+ ♔ c5 8.b4#.
2.hxg7+ ♔ xg7 3. ♗ h6+ ♔ f7 4. ♖ f1+ ♕ f6 5. ♕ d5+ ♔ e7
All forced; not 5...♖ e6 6.♖ xf6+ ♔ xf6 7.♗ g5+ ♔ f7 8.♕ f5+.
6. ♗ g5 ♕ xg5 7. ♖ f7+ ♔ d8 8. ♕ xg5+ ♗ e7 9. ♕ d5 and White
converted the winning ending, 1-0 .
FCM 5.2
Speelman-Benko Rotterdam 1987 Black apparently expected White to defend the d-pawn with 1.♘ g6 ♖ e8 2.♘ e5, but the creative Englishman prefers to force Black to execute his 'threat':
1. ♖ f3 ♕ xd4
On 1...♕ g5 comes the same crushing reply.
2. ♘ g6
The threatened mate-in-two trumps everything.
2... ♖ e8 3. ♕ xe6+ ♖ xe6 4. ♖ f8+ ♔ h7 5. ♖ h8#
FCM 5.3
Delva-Levtchouk Montreal 1982 Black's two major pieces are hanging, but he has prepared far more important business than defending the queen:
1... ♖ c5!!
Forcing resignation. The ♗ a7 must be given to meet the dual mate threat on c1/b2.
FCM 5.4
Movsesian-Sutovsky Kaskady 2002 Black's attack should win due to White's airy king, but there is plenty of wiggle room in lines such as 1...♕ e2? 2.♖ c2 ♕ b5? 3.♕ f5!, forcing a queen swap. 1...♕ e3 is a good move, but after putting in some brute force sweat equity, Black determines there's no better time than now to initiate decisive action:
1... ♖ xa2!! 2. ♖ c2
There is no hope in 2.♗ xf3 ♖ xb2+ 3.♔ a1 ♖ a8+; 2.♔ xa2 ♕ e2! and 3...♖ a8+; or 2.♕ xa2 ♕ xe4+ 3.♔ a1 ♗ xb2+ 4.♕ xb2 ♖ a8+ and Black comes out a piece ahead.
2... ♖ xb2+
Even stronger was 2...♖ a1+! 3.♔ xa1 ♖ a8+ 4.♔ b1 ♕ a3.
3. ♖ xb2 ♕ a3 4. ♕ b3
Desperation, because the king flaps slowly in the breeze on 4.♖ xb7 ♕ a1+ or 4.♖ a2 ♕ b4+ 5.♔ c1 ♘ d4.
4... ♗ xb2 5. ♕ xb2 ♕ e3 0-1 The extra pawn and naked white king
decide.
FCM 5.5
Horowitz-Flohr USA-Soviet Union radio match 1945 ...e5-e4, hitting the queen, was the only try to justify Black's fractured position, but the American uncorked a stronger threat:
1. ♗ b6 ♖ xg2+
The key point is the winning fork after 1...♗ e7 2.♕ xg4 ♘ xg4: 3.♘ g7+.
2. ♕ xg2 ♕ xf5 3. ♖ d8+ ♖ xd8 4. ♖ xd8+ ♔ e7 5. ♕ g3 1-0
FCM 5.6
Lobron-Miles Biel 1986 With both kings under siege, White's extra exchange is less important than who comes first. Being tied to c2 would be woeful for White, but a formidable EST forces Black to cash in there at the wrong time:
1. ♖ hd1
Threatening a back-rank mate.
1... ♗ xc2+
Blocking the d-file allows a deadly check on h7 after 1...♗ d7 2.♖ xd7!. Black could try 1...fxg6 to avoid the coming blow on g6, but then the white rook returns to the h-file with crushing effect: 2.hxg6 ♗ xc2+ 3.♖ xc2 ♖ xc2 4.♖ h1! with a stock mate on h8.
2. ♖ xc2 ♖ xc2 3.gxf7+ ♔ xf7 4. ♕ g6+ Picking off the ♖ c2; 1-0 .
FCM 5.7
Blatny-Deng Kong Liang Hawaii 1998 A quick look at the relative king positions tells the story: something has gone horribly wrong for White here. Black cuts right to the chase with the whimsical 1...a5 2. ♗ xc6 axb4! , proving again that mate is worth more than the queen: 0-1 .
FCM 5.8
C.Hansen-Hillarp Persson Malmö/Copenhagen 2004 White can't afford to dally as he could even lose after 1.♕ c7? ♕ h6. A deadly EST, bringing one more piece to the battle, pushes his attack over the top:
1. ♘ f5! ♔ h8
Hoping to evict the white queen. Clearly, on 1...♖ xe7 2.♘ xe7+ wins, while on 1...♗ h3 comes the breakthrough 2.♖ xc6! ♘ xc6
3.♘ h6+ ♔ h8 (3...♕ xh6 4.♕ f7+ ♔ h8 5.♕ xe8+) 4.♘ f7+ and
5.♕ xe8. 1...h5!? may be Black's best chance.
2. ♖ b8! with the elegant conclusion 2...♖ xb8 3.♕ xe5+; 1-0
FCM 5.9
Spassky-T.V.Petrosian Moscow 1969 Attacking the Sicilian requires gusto!
1.e5! dxe5 2. ♘ e4!
A forceful attacking EST dislodging the lynchpin of Black's defense, the ♘ f6.
2... ♘ h5
Otherwise White crashes through on g7 or g8: 2...♘ xe4? 3.♖ xf8+! ♖ xf8 4.♕ xg7#; 2...exd4 3.♘ xf6 ♖ e7 (3...gxf6 4.♕ g8#) 4.♕ g6! with a stock mate on h7 or g8.
3. ♕ g6 exd4
All roads lead to mate or worse: 3...♕ h4 4.♘ f3 ♕ h3 5.♘ xe5! followed by ♘ f7+, with ♘ xh6+, ♖ xf8+, and ♕ g7# coming; 3...♘ f4 4.♖ xf4 exf4 5.♘ f3!! ♗ c6 6.♘ eg5!.
4. ♘ g5! hxg5 5. ♕ xh5+ ♔ g8 6. ♕ f7+ ♔ h7 7. ♖ f3 e5 8. ♕ h5#
FCM 5.10
Sutovsky-Grosar Pula 2000 Black can resist the attack in lines such as 1.♕ e5 ♘ g4 2.♕ f4 ♘ f6
3.♘ xf8 ♗ xf5! 4.g4 ♘ xg4 5.♘ g3 ♖ xf8 6.♘ xf5 ♖ xf5 7.♕ xg4 ♕
b5, but White has no intention of moving the queen with a much stronger attacking option at hand:
1.fxg6! ♗ e7
1...♘ xe4 2.♖ xf8#.
2. ♖ xf6! ♗ xf6 3. ♖ f1 ♗ g7 4. ♕ f5! 1-0 On 4...♕ b7 White has a
pleasant choice of mates: 5.♕ f8+ ♗ xf8 6.♖ xf8#, or 5.♕ f7+ ♕ xf7
6.gxf7#.
FCM 5.11
Ujtumen-Miagmarsuren Mongolia 1975 Black relishes a complex Sicilian ending, but White has other ideas:
1.g6!! fxg6
A sinking feeling for Black; if 1...♕ xe5 2.gxf7+ ♔ f8 3.♖ g8#; or
1...hxg6 2.♕ h5 e5 (2...♗ f8 3.♖ xg6+! fxg6 4.♕ xg6+ and 5.♕
xe8) 3.♖ xf7! as in the game.
2. ♕ h5!
No trade! The sudden onslaught against Black's weak points g6, h7 and f7 is unbearable.
2...e5
2...♖ f8 3.♖ xg6+ hxg6 4.♕ xg6+ ♔ h8 5.♕ h6+ ♔ g8 6.♖ g1+,
mating.
3. ♖ f7!
The crowning idea! This important stock shot forces a winning breakthrough on h7.
3... ♔ xf7 4. ♕ xh7+ ♔ f8
4...♔ e6 5.♗ g4+.
5. ♖ xg6 1-0
After 5...♕ xg6 6.♕ xg6, there is no good answer to the tremendous threats ♗ h5 and ♘ d5.
FCM 5.12
Ziatdinov-Shabalov Toronto 1998 Black tries to buy one more tempo to consolidate his extra material with ...♔ e7, but he doesn't get it, thanks to an EST:
1. ♗ xd5! ♕ xb5 2. ♗ xc6+ ♔ xc6 3. ♘ d4+ ♔ c5 4. ♘ xb5 ♔ xb5 5. ♖ d7 1-
0
FCM 5.13
Littlewood-Roth Havana 1966 Black's frantic ...b7-b5 was understandable but naive, allowing the deadly EST 1. ♖ e8! , with a stock mate on f6 after 1...♖ xe8 or
1....♕ b4: 2.♕ xf6#.
FCM 5.14
Ni Hua-Zhao Jun Yongchuan 2003 White is bent on attacking the black king, but will he have enough wood? A devastating EST shows that all is in order:
1. ♘ xf6!! ♖ d8
Long lines lead to Black's demise: 1...♘ xa1 2.♘ d7+; 1...♕ xf6
2.♕ xf6 gxf6 3.♗ h6+ ♔ g8 4.♘ h4! with a winning edge; 1...gxf6
2.♗ h6+ ♔ g8 3.♖ e4!; 1...♕ d8 2.♖ e8+! ♕ xe8 3.♗ d6+ ♕ e7
4.♗ xe7+ ♔ xe7 5.♕ e5+, mating soon.
2. ♘ e5!!
A second profound EST decides the battle. Amazingly, there is no answer to 3.♘ ed7+.
2... ♕ xf6
2...♕ b7 3.♘ ed7+ ♖ xd7 4.♖ e8# was the point.
3. ♘ d7+ ♖ xd7 4. ♕ xf6 ♘ xe1
Or 4...gxf6 5.♗ h6+ and ♖ e8#.
5. ♕ c6 1-0 . If 5...♖ e7 6.♕ c8+ and 7.♗ d6+. A classy display of
selection, calculation, and board sight; i.e. computer eyes.
FCM 5.15
Beyer-Wade New Zealand 1940 Black chose a catastrophic way to address White's threat on g7, falling for the EST 1. ♘ xe4! ♗ xf6 2. ♘ xf6+ ♔ h8 when the final point was the 100% forcing surprise move 3. ♗ g7+! ♔ xg7 4. ♘ xe8+ 1-0 .
FCM 5.16
Azmaiparashvili-Lastin Tripoli 2004 The probability that a threat can be ignored, in favor of something better, certainly increases when one has a strong initiative. So Black eschews 1...♗ f5 2.♗ f1! (though the EST 2...♘ b4! would still suffice), preferring the neater counter-threat 1... ♘ e1! 2. ♖ xe1 ♕ xe1+
3. ♕ xe1 ♖ xe1+ 4. ♔ f2 ♖ a1! 0-1 . It's all over after 5.fxg4 ♖ xa2+.
FCM 5.17
Tukmakov-Panno Buenos Aires 1970 White allowed ...fxe4, attacking his rook and queen, diabolically assessing that the coming attack on h7 and g7 is worth more than the lady! He could start a promising attack with 1.♖ xh7+! ♔ xh7
2.♕ xe4+ ♗ f5 3.♕ h4+, but there is even better:
1.e6!! exd3
On 1...♗ xe6 comes the dashing refutation 2.♗ xg7+! ♔ xg7 3.♕ d4+, mating soon.
2. ♗ xd3 ♘ f6
Sadly forced! If 2...♗ f6 3.♖ xh7#, or 2...h6 3.gxh6 ♘ xh6 4.♖ xh6+ ♔ g8 5.♖ xg7#. On 2...♘ h6 either capture wins; I invite the reader to exercise his or her computer eyes and work out the variations.
3.gxf6 ♗ xf6 4. ♖ xh7+ ♔ g8 5. ♖ gxg7+! ♗ xg7 6. ♖ xg7+ ♔ h8 7. ♖ h7+
♔ g8 8. ♖ h8# B) Momentum-changing Equal or Stronger Threats These are critical positions in which an EST alters the course of the game. In some cases, the apparent defender may suddenly turn the tables and launch a decisive blow:
FCM 5.18
NN-Rossolimo Paris 1957 Black is three(!) pawns down and can't defend b7, but the Franco- American attacking genius uncorks the mind-blowing EST 1... ♖ d1 , threatening mate in two! Preposterously, there is no way out:
2. ♗ xb7+
2.♕ xb5 ♗ xf2+ 3.♔ h2 ♖ h8#.
2... ♔ b8 3.c4
There is no solace in 3.♖ bxd1 ♕ xb2 4.♖ b1 ♗ xf2+, or 3.♖ fxd1 ♗ xf2+ and 4...♖ h8#.
3... ♖ xf2
Not 3...♗ xf2+? 4.♕ xf2!.
4. ♕ xb5 If 4.♕ xf2 ♗ xf2+ 5.♔ xf2 ♕ xb1, but now comes a stock
double-rook mate: 4... ♖ fxf1+ 5. ♔ h2 ♖ h1# .
FCM 5.19
Van Wely-Seirawan Wijk aan Zee 1995 White has provoked a tactical crisis to justify his risky underdevelopment. Black is ready with a punishing attack:
1... ♕ b2! 2. ♖ d1
Forced!
2... ♘ b3! 3. ♕ xe4 ♕ xc3+ 4. ♘ d2 ♘ xd2 5. ♖ xd2
Or the appealing double check 5.♕ d3 ♘ f3#!
5... ♕ a1+ 6. ♖ d1 ♕ xd1+! 7. ♔ xd1 ♘ xf2+ 8. ♔ c2 ♘ xe4 and Black won
the ending.
FCM 5.20
Forintos-Tomovic Budapest 1957 White's king looks much more imperiled, but his 'spite checks' prove decisive!
1. ♗ d3+
Or also 1.♖ h8+! with the same idea.
1...g6 2. ♖ h8+! ♔ xh8 3. ♕ f8+ ♔ h7 4. ♕ xf7+ ♔ h8
Black undoubtedly saw these moves and expected a perpetual, but White delved one forcing move deeper:
5. ♕ f8+ ♔ h7 6. ♗ xg6+!
Ouch!
6... ♔ xg6 7. ♕ g8#
FCM 5.21
Tkach-Jame Anderson Watertown 1996 Black seems to be under pressure, but he takes the helm with a cool forcing EST exposing White's vulnerability:
1... ♗ d6!!
Not 1...♕ d7 2.♖ e5!.
2.fxe4
The dual threats 2...♕ h4 and 2...♕ d7 were tremendous. Clearly losing were 2.dxc5 (or 2.♘ d2) 2...♗ xh2+! 3.♔ xh2 ♕ h4+ 4.♔ g1 ♕ e1+ 5.♔ h2 ♖ f5; and 2.g3 ♖ xf3 3.dxc5 (3.♘ d2 ♘ xd2 4.♕ xd2 ♗ xg3 5.♗ xc5 ♕ h4 6.♖ e2 ♗ f4 7.♕ c2 ♗ e3+ 8.♔ h1 ♕ f4 9.♕ d1 ♖ e8-+) 3...♕ f8! 4.♘ d2 ♖ xg3+! 5.hxg3 ♕ f2+ 6.♔ h1 ♘ xg3#.
2... ♗ xh2+! 3. ♔ xh2 ♕ h4+ 4. ♔ g1 ♕ e1+ 5. ♔ h2 ♖ f1 with mate
coming; 0-1 .
FCM 5.22
Uhlmann-Dely Budapest 1962 Some EST's turn the tables much more abruptly. White was no doubt feeling very cocky about the threat on g7 when down dropped the stock double rook mate 1... ♕ g2+ 2. ♖ xg2 ♖ e1+ 0-1 .
FCM 5.23
Sax-Gallagher Baden 1999 With g7 falling, Black appears ready to fold, but computer eyes see a different picture:
1... ♘ c5!! 2. ♗ xf6 ♕ a2+ 3. ♔ c1 ♘ xb3+ 4.cxb3 ♖ fc8+ 5. ♔ d2 ♕ a5+!!
The amazing point. Black wants much more than the approximately equal ending after 5...♕ xb2+ 6.♔ e1 ♕ xg2.
6. ♔ e3 ♕ b6+! 7. ♔ e2
Not 7.♔ e4 ♕ b4+ 8.♔ e3 (8.♔ f5 ♕ f4#) 8...♕ f4+ 9.♔ d3 ♕ d4+
10.♔ e2 ♖ c2+ 11.♔ e1 ♕ e3+, or 7.♔ d2 ♕ b4+! 8.♔ e3 ♕ f4+.
7... ♖ c2+ 8. ♖ d2 ♖ xd2+ 9. ♔ xd2 ♕ d4+ 10. ♔ c2
Or 10.♔ e2 ♕ xb2+ 11.♔ e3 ♕ d4+.
10... ♖ c8+ 11. ♔ b1 ♕ d3+ 12. ♔ a2 ♖ a8#
An impressive display of brute force calculation and the power of the EST to turn the game around.
FCM 5.24
Filippov-Van Wely Tripoli Wch 2004 In a murky tableau White uses an EST to expose the Achilles' heel of Black's position, which is e7:
1. ♖ b1! ♕ d2
1...♖ xe4 2.♖ xb2 wins a piece, while 1...♕ e5 2.♕ xe5 ♗ xe5
3.♖ b7 wins f7 and more.
2. ♖ b8!!
The nasty point is 2...♖ xb8 3.♕ e7+ and mate, but Black's forced reply only forestalls the invasion.
2... ♗ e5 3. ♖ xe8+ ♔ xe8 4. ♗ xf7+! ♔ d8
On 4...♔ xf7, 5.♕ b7+ ♔ e6 6.♕ c8 mates shortly.
5. ♕ a8+ ♔ c7 6. ♕ a7+ ♔ d8
6...♔ c6 7.♗ e8#.
7. ♕ b8+ ♔ d7 8. ♗ e8+ 1-0
Opposite-colored bishops favor the attacker, as seen here - the black bishop was a bystander.
FCM 5.25
Matov-Fischer Vinkovci 1968 White wants to execute a rook lift and attack the king after 1...♕ c7
2.♖ h3, but Black prefers to demonstrate a forced win with a
momentum-changing EST:
1... ♘ c4! 2. ♕ d3
Also dropping lumber are 2.♘ xc5 ♘ xd2 or 2.♗ xc4 ♕ xc4.
2... ♕ xd4 3. ♕ xd4 ♗ xd4 4. ♗ xc4 b5 0-1 .
A nice array of winning double attacks.
FCM 5.26
Van der Sterren-Gildardo Garcia Reykjavik 1994 Both sides may have aimed for this position; Black, because he wins after 1.♗ d3?? ♖ ac8, and White, because he saw through the position with the haymaker 1. ♖ xa5! ♕ xa3 2. ♖ xa3 ♖ xa3 (or 2...♖ xc2 3.♖ xa8+ ♗ xa8 4.♗ xc2, winning) 3. ♖ xc7 gxf5 4. ♖ xb7 ♖ xa2 5. ♖ b4 1-0 .
FCM 5.27
Gulko-Ardaman Hawaii 1998 One can hardly fault Black for expecting his threats to prevail, but a magical EST clarifies all in White's favor, showing the computer eyes that separate elite GM's from the pack:
1. ♘ d6!! ♕ xc4
White keeps the exchange after 1...♖ xd6 2.cxd6 ♕ xc4 3.♖ xc4.
2. ♗ xc4!
The EST 2...♗ xc6 3.♘ f7+ ♔ g8 4.♘ xd8+ lets White calmly leave a whole rook hanging!
2... ♗ xd6
If now 2...♖ xd6 3.cxd6! ♗ xc6 4.dxe7 ♘ g6 5.♗ d6 and 6.♖ f8+ is strongest.
3. ♖ xd6
A 'hook-up' theme rescues the material decisively.
3... ♖ c8 4. ♗ xa6 ♗ xa6 5. ♖ xa6 ♖ xc5 6. ♗ d6 1-0
FCM 5.28
Yedidia-Edelman Parsippany 1998 In a topical theoretical line, the New England IM made an important discovery: a momentum-turning EST that puts Black out of business.
1.e7!! ♘ xe7
Clearly the only move.
2. ♕ b3+ ♔ g7 3. ♖ d1 ♕ e8 4. ♖ xc7 1-0 The attack against the
exposed king (♕ c3+ and ♗ e6+) and along the seventh rank is too strong.
FCM 5.29
Karpov-Kasparov (variation) Moscow 1985 In this wild variation from a World Championship match game, the clever pin of the ♖ e4 doesn't save Black due to an interpolating
EST:
1. ♕ c4! ♖ xe4 2. ♕ g8+
Skewering the queen after 2...♔ e7 3.♕ xg7+; 1-0 .
FCM 5.30
Crisovan-Naef Lucerne 1953 Black's threats prove stronger in this tactical maelstrom:
1... ♘ d4! 2. ♕ b2
Forking themes are White's undoing in the lines 2.exd4 ♖ xc1 3.♕ b2? ♘ g3+! 4.♕ xc1 ♘ e2+; and 2.♕ xf1 ♖ xc1 3.♕ xc1? ♘ e2+.
2... ♖ xc1 3.h3
3.f3 generates another fork by the dancing knights: 3...♘ xe3+ 4.♔
f2 ♘ d1+!.
3... ♘ e2+! 4. ♔ h1 ♘ fg3+ 5. ♔ h2 ♖ h1#
FCM 5.31
Giri-Nepomniachtchi Wijk aan Zee 2011 One of the biggest chess sins is to back down when the position demands concrete action. Moving the attacked queen is too slow:
1...♕ g7?? 2.♖ g3+- or 1...♕ e6?? 2.♕ g5+ and 3.♖ xc5 with
equal chances. Only cool-headed brute force calculation proves that Black's attack is stronger:
1... ♘ xd4+! 2. ♔ f1
If 2.♖ xd4 ♖ xd4 3.♗ xd4 (crucial boardsight notices 3.♕ xd4 ♕ a6+!), simplest is 3...♕ g2+ 4.♔ e1 ♕ xd2+ 5.♔ xd4 ♖ xd4+ and
6...♖ a4-+.
2... ♘ xf3! 3. ♕ xd5 ♖ xd5 4. ♗ xf3
White battles gamely with the threat of 5.♖ g3, but falls just short. If
4.♗ xg6 ♘ d2+ with a winning endgame.
4... ♗ xf2! 5. ♗ xd5 ♕ g1+ 6. ♔ e2 ♕ e1+ 7. ♔ f3 ♕ f1! 0-1
The randomness of such positions usually favors the attacker, and it turns out the white rook has nowhere to hide: 8.♖ h6 ♕ d1+ 9.♔ xf2 ♕ d2+.

Ex 5.2 Vydeslaver-Avrukh Israel tt 2002 At first blush the threat 2.♘ f5 looks decisive, but Black finds an impressive resource, 'reminding' White that his king is in fact more exposed: 1... ♖ ec3!! 2.bxc3 2.exd7 leads to mate after 2...♖ c1+ 3.♖ xc1 ♖ xc1+ 4.♔ xa2 ♕ a6+ 5.♔ b3 ♕ c4+ 6.♔ a3 ♖ a1#; while b2 falls on 2.♘ e2 (or 2.♖ dd1) 2...♖ c2, and the black attack is too strong after 2.e5 ♖ c1+ 3.♖ xc1 ♖ xc1+ 4.♔ a2 ♕ a5+. 2... ♖ b8 3. ♖ xa2 ♕ b3! 4. ♖ c1 ♗ xe6!

Ex 5.3 Emms-L.B.Hansen Esbjerg 2000 The 'routine' ...♖ c8 was greeted by the not-so-routine EST 1. ♘ f5! , cashing in on White's pressure: 1... ♘ xf5 Mate on g7 was threatened, and 1...♕ g6 2.♘ xe7 ♘ xe7 3.♖ xe7! or 1...♕ f6 2.♕ xf6 gxf6 3.♘ d6 stank. 2. ♗ xf5! d4 The same fate befalls 2...♖ cd8.

Ex 5.4 Furman-Witkowski Polanica Zdroj 1967 As in the prior position, Black relies on the 'normal' ♖ f8 to ease the pressure in this queenless middlegame, but computer eyes notice that the critical moment has arrived with the EST 1. ♖ e4! , mopping up with the stock threat 1...♖ xf7 2.♘ g6+ hxg6 3.♖ h4#, or 1... ♗ xf4 2. ♗ xg7+ ♖ xg7 3. ♖ xf8+ 1-0 . Ex 5.5 Ljubojevic-Nunn Szirak 1987 White hopes to flounder on with g3-g4 and ♘ e4, but the shocking ATTACKING EST 1...fxg3!! 2.fxg4 ♖ f2+ 3. ♔ h3 ♖ xh2# retires that notion. In high-level play, the hours of technical work saved by such forcing moves are invaluable, conserving precious energy for the next battle. Ex 5.6 Wade-Boxall Middleton-on-Sea 1953
1. ♗ xf7 1-0 A knockout punch from left field. The threat 2.♘ g6#
costs Black decisive material. Ex 5.7 Kengis-Nevednichy Moscow 1979 The sharp Latvian has already sacked a piece, and 1.gxf6+?? ♘ g6
2.♕ h6 ♕ xf6 doesn't cut it. But he can create a threat that
outweighs all others: 1. ♕ h6! ♘ xd3+ 1...♔ h8 2.♖ h3 ♗ xf5 3.g6! ♗ xh3 (or 3...♗ xg6 4.♖ xg6!) 4.♕ xh7#. 2. ♔ b1 Not clear is 2.♔ d2!? ♕ b6 3.♖ g2 ♕ f2+! 4.♖ xf2 ♘ xf2 5.gxf6 ♘ e4+ and 6...♘ xf6, and 2.cxd3?? ♔ h8 3.g6 fxg6 4.fxg6 ♕ c7+ 5.♔ b1 ♕ g7 even loses! 2... ♔ h8 2...fxg5 3.f6 and Black has to give the queen. 3.g6 1-0 The threats against h7 and g7 are too much (3...fxg6 4.fxg6 ♕ e7
5.g7+).
Ex 5.8 Mikhalchishin-Topalovic Varazdin 2003 Black calmly stares down the barrel of a gun and demonstrates with BRUTE FORCE ANALYSIS that his threats prevail: 1... ♕ h1+! 2. ♔ xh1 ♘ xf2+ 3. ♔ g1 Or 3.♔ h2 ♘ g4+ 4.♔ h3 ♕ xe3+ 5.♔ h4 ♕ h6 or also

Threatening to mate or make a queen. 4. ♔ xb2 Or 4.♘ b3 cxd1♕ + 5.♔ xb2 ♖ xd8. 4...cxd1 ♘ +! 0-1 . A beautiful UNDERPROMOTION/FORK TRICK . Ex 5.10 Onischuk-Adianto Beijing 2000 Black is under huge pressure, but why protect the rook when concrete analysis shows a winning breakthrough right now? 1.fxe5 fxe5
2. ♕ xe5! ♕ xe5 3. ♗ xe5 ♗ xd1 On 3...♖ xb3 4.♖ f7 ♖ g8 5.♗ xg7+
♖ xg7 6.♖ f8 mates. 4. ♗ xc7 ♗ e2 The point is 4...♗ xb3 5.♗ xd8 (or 4...♖ xd5 28.♖ f8#), with mate hanging as well as the ♖ b6. 5. ♗ xd8 ♗ xf1 6. ♗ xb6 ♗ xd3 7. ♗ xc5 1-0 Ex 5.11 Puljek Salai-Stanec Porec 1994 After 1. ♘ xf5! Black is obviously counting on the defensive EST 1... ♗ f6 , but White sees deeper with his own EST 2. ♘ h6+! , engendering the stock mate 2... ♔ h8 3. ♕ xf6 gxf6 4. ♗ xf6# . Ex 5.12 Fischer-Geller Skopje 1967 Black has no prospects of defending his besieged king; e.g. 1...♗ f6?? 2.♖ xf6! ♘ xf6 3.♗ xf6, winning. But with the counterattacking EST 1... ♗ a4! he declares that he can do something even better: come first! 2. ♕ g4 Scary is 2.♖ h5 ♗ xb3 3.♖ xh7+ (3.♗ xg7+ ♔ xg7 4.♕ h6+ ♔ xf7) 3...♔ xh7 4.♕ f5+ ♔ h6 5.♕ h3+ ♔ g6, but the king slips away via f7-e8. 2... ♗ f6! Now this move serves only to gain the winning tempo: 3. ♖ xf6 ♗ xb3! 4. ♖ g6 ♗ a2+! and stock mate on b2; 0-1 . Ex 5.13 Balashov-Lanka Naberezhnye Chelny 1988 The 'normal' e4 meets an embarrassing reply: the momentum- changing EST 1... ♗ e2 . Oops. 2. ♗ xe2 Or 2.exd5 ♗ xd3 with a winning pawn-up position. 2... ♘ c3 Followed by a fork on e2; 0-1 . Ex 5.14 Simutowe-I.Sokolov Tripoli 2004 Black didn't enter this position to turn back now, but rather to press the attack decisively with the EST 1... ♘ g4! with the monster threats
2...♕ xe1# and 2...♘ xh2#. 2. ♗ xf7+ and White resigned after 2... ♔
f8 , though yet a bit better is 2...♔ xf7 3.♕ f5+ ♔ g8 4.♕ d5+ ♔ h8, when White still can't escape the fork 5.♖ xe3 ♘ xe3+. 0-1 Ex 5.15 Al.Karpov-Ovetchkin Smolensk 2000 Quite modern-looking was Karpov's stroke of genius 1. ♗ f4!! , employing sensational tactics to convert the initiative: 1... ♕ xf4 Or the winning discovery 1...♕ xa1+ 2.♖ d1+!. 2.c6! 1-0 Black must dump a rook with 2...♖ xc6 3.♖ xd8+ to avoid mate on b7! Ex 5.16 Zhou Jianchao-Malysheva Moscow 2004 Black made a serious miscalculation in planting her knight on h3 as White now forces her to execute her 'threat': 1. ♔ h2! ♘ xf2 2. ♖ xf2! ♕ xf2 3.e4 Trapping the queen on an open board! 3... ♗ xc5 4. ♖ xc5! White justifiably wants more than 4.♗ xf2. 4... ♗ a4 5. ♕ xa4 ♕ d2 6. ♗ c3 ♕ e3 7. ♖ xd5 1-0
CHAPTER 6
Quiet forcing moves Study material In the last two chapters, we dazzled your eyes with shocking surprise moves, then taught them to reject automatic defensive responses by first examining aggressive counterpunching forcing moves (EST's). In this chapter, we will ask your computer eyes to overcome a very different kind of human bias! When we start to realize the power of forcing moves, we develop the important habit of looking at all the loud forcing moves, no matter how ridiculous they appear. We have shed our bias enough to know that these 'crazy' moves often win! The problem is this: sometimes the strongest forcing move is not the stunning sacrifice, but instead the move that appears too 'quiet' to human eyes, until brute force analysis shows that it actually creates winning threats! Here is the paradox: 'quiet' forcing moves are not really quiet at all! It is only our human instinct to categorize and describe things, which makes them seem 'quiet'. These 'creepers' are just so different from the checks, captures, invasions, and sacrifices which we have learned to look for when attacking. In order to train our computer eyes to overcome the bias toward 'loud' attacking moves, we need to remember the definition of a forcing move: a move which limits the opponent's options . Quiet forcing moves are counterintuitive until we understand their hidden threats. But computer eyes strive for greater objectivity and creativity, by seeking to find and calculate hidden forcing options, before we categorize and reject them. In this chapter, you will discover many positions in which an innocuous-looking quiet move proved to be the most forcing move on the board, and in fact the only way to justify the attack. If you sense during a game that your attack may be winning, but can't find the final forcing move to make it work, I suggest that you remember to try the quiet forcing option. In order to train your computer eyes to find these 'silent killers', we will examine two types in this chapter: A) Quiet key moves : these are quiet-looking moves which reveal themselves as 'the winning shot' once their impact has sunk in. B) Quiet connectors are decisive quiet moves tucked in the middle of more 'violent' forcing sequences. Since they disrupt the flow of prior 'loud' attacking moves, they are easily overlooked by both attacker and defender. Among the nicest chess moves ever played was the following stunning quiet connector, which had to be foreseen many moves earlier:
FCM 6.1
Sunye Neto-Kasparov (variation) Dortmund 1982
1... ♖ dxg2!! 2. ♘ xg2 ♖ g3!! , and 3...♖ xh3# can only be averted by
allowing the stock mate 3. ♘ f4 ♖ g1# . A) Quiet key moves
FCM 6.2
Nunn-C.Hansen Naestved 1985 Black had the 'big moves' covered, but understandably missed a ridiculously strong little bombshell:
1. ♗ f6!!
Forcing instant resignation.
1... ♕ xe4
Or 1...♕ xf6 2.♖ xg7+ ♔ h8 3.♖ xh7#; 1...♖ xf6 2.♖ xg7+ ♔ f8
3.♖ g8+ ♔ e7 4.♖ 1g7+ ♖ f7 5.♕ xf5; best is the pathetic 1...♕
xg4 as was actually played by Hansen.
2. ♖ xg7+ ♔ h8 3. ♖ g8#
FCM 6.3
Ponomariov-Radjabov Wijk aan Zee 2003 White's bid for counterplay is squashed by a little move underscoring the dominance of Black's invading forces:
1... ♕ e2! The 'slow' threat ...♕ f3-g2 is unstoppable. 2. ♕ h5 g4 0-1
An important type of quiet forcing move, familiar from stock mating positions, is the QUIET PREEMPTIVE MOVE that seals off the king's escape in the midst of the attack:
FCM 6.4
Almasi-De la Riva Aguado Pamplona 2001/02 The subtle 1. ♖ e1! forces mate, since 1...♗ e5 2.♕ h8+ ♔ e7 3.♕ xg7# is no help. In another crucial version of the quiet key move, the attacker's king takes a crucial 'time out', tucking himself away safely, in order to quash essential counterplay before launching the final attack:
FCM 6.5
Enders-Knaak Germany Bundesliga 1999/00 White's shaky defense rests on the pin of the black rook, but after 1... ♔ h7! he runs out of tricks, e.g. 2.♖ xc8 ♕ b2#, or 2.♖ fb1 ♕ a4+.
2. ♕ b6 ♖ c4! 0-1 3.♖ a8 ♖ b4! does the trick. Even more forcing was
2...♕ a4+ 3.♔ b1 ♖ c3.
On other occasions the 'quiet king move' is employed not only to forestall counterplay, but to initiate direct threats:
FCM 6.6
Vaisser-Degraeve Val d'Isere 2004
1. ♔ f2!
Not only threatening 2.♖ h1, but guarding g3 to free up the white queen. Black is forced to push the panic button.
1...e4
2...♕ h5 27.♘ xe5+.
2. ♗ xe4 h5 3. ♕ f5!
With the tremendous threats 4.♕ g6+ or 4.♘ h6+.
3... ♔ f8
On 3...♖ xe4, 4.♘ h6+ wins the queen.
4. ♕ h7! ♖ xe4 5. ♕ h8+ ♔ f7 6. ♘ h6+ ♔ g6 7. ♕ g7#
Rarer still in middlegames is the case where the opponent is so stymied by a powerful bind, that the king himself becomes the executioner, playing a leading role in the attack:
FCM 6.7
Short-Timman Tilburg 1991 In this awful-looking predicament, Black actually has a legitimate plan to extricate himself with ...♖ ce8 and ...♗ c8, while White's obvious attacking tries ♘ g5 and g2-g4 are held in check by Black's battery on the a8-h1 diagonal. But a fantastic flight of fancy shows that Black's liberation mission is a tad too slow:
1. ♔ g3!!
One white piece is at liberty to exploit the weak dark squares!
1... ♖ ce8 2. ♔ f4! ♗ c8 3. ♔ g5!
And Black resigned in view of 3... ♗ xd7 (3...♔ h7 4.♕ xg6+!) 4. ♔ h6 . When the opponent faces very strong positional pressure, one well- placed quiet move may set the pot to boiling, cooking his proverbial goose:
FCM 6.8
Svidler-Chernyshov Voronezh 2003 Premature is 1.♖ xc4? ♕ xc4 2.♗ xd5 ♕ c1, but simply 1. ♖ ec3! (threat: 2.♖ xc4) was quietly irresistible: 1...b5 and now 2.♗ xd5! as well as 2.a4! ♔ e7 3.axb5 ♕ xb5 4.♗ xd5 wins.
FCM 6.9
Mortensen-Maninang Lucerne 1982 Masterly insight recognizes that a 'quiet' exchange of queens may be the strongest attacking idea when the enemy queen is the lynchpin of his defenses: after 1. ♕ f5! ♕ xf5 2.gxf5 , Black should be put to sleep rather than enduring the loss of the exchange (2...♖ d8
3.♗ b6) or the imprisonment of all his pieces after 2...♘ b8 3.♖ d8;
1-0 . Not just the queen, but any piece crucial to the defense may be the target of A 'QUIET' EXCHANGING OPERATION :
FCM 6.10
Almasi-I.Sokolov Wijk aan Zee 1995 White surely considered the 'loud' forcing moves ...♕ g3, ...♗ xe1, ...♘ xf3, and ....♗ h3; but a 'softer model' may have escaped his radar:
1... ♗ g4! launches a mating attack with 2....♕ h1+ and 3...♕ xg2; 0-
1 .
FCM 6.11
Anand-Short Merida 2001 Computer eyes reveal that contrary to appearances, 'quiet forcing shots' aren't quiet at all! It's not how they look but what they do that counts! In this exceptionally treacherous position, the strongest forcing move proved to be a modest creeper:
1. ♕ e1! ♗ d8
After 1...♗ xc5 2.♖ xe7+ ♔ f8 3.♖ e8+ ♔ g7 4.♖ g3+ White mates soon, e.g. 4...♖ g6 5.♕ c3+.
2. ♖ e2! 1-0
The bishop is overloaded after 2...♕ a5, see 3.♖ xe7+! ♗ xe7 4.♕ xa5. An important endgame stratagem is the quiet move guarding key escape squares, to construct a mating net. (see fragment next page)
FCM 6.12
Giri-Naiditsch Wijk aan Zee 2014
1.f3!
Threatening to win a piece with 1.♖ g5+.
1...e5
Forced by the sudden mate threat 2.♖ f7+! and 3.♖ g5. Black has zero chance to hold with 1...♖ g8 2.♖ xg8 ♖ xg8 3.♖ c5+ ♔ f4
4.♖ xa5 ♔ xf3 5.♖ e5 ♖ g6 6.♘ d2+ ♔ f4 7.♖ e4+.
2. ♖ g5+ ♔ f4
2...♔ e6 3.♖ g6+ ♔ d5 (3...♔ f5 4.♖ f6#) 4.♖ c5#.
3. ♔ f2
Another quiet connector fixes the noose.
3... ♖ f8 4. ♖ h7 1-0
FCM 6.13
Fedoseev-Kramnik Wijk aan Zee 2019 White is betting his king activity will pay off after 1...♔ e6 2.f4! f5+?
3.♔ g5 and he's better on 3...♕ h3 4.♕ d1 or 3...♖ e1 4.♖ e3+. A
quiet forcing move proves instead that the WK is too exposed to marauding majors:
1... ♔ g6! 2. ♖ e3
White must defend e4 in light of 2.♖ xd5 f5+! 3.♔ f4 ♖ e4+!.
2... ♖ g5+!
But now comes the second surprise; 3.hxg5 ♕ h5+ 4.♔ f4 ♕ xg5#.
3. ♔ f4 ♖ f5+ 4. ♔ g4 ♖ g5+ 5. ♔ f4 ♕ h3! 6.g4 ♕ xh4 -+ and... 0-1 .
FCM 6.14
Perez Perez-Cobo Arteaga Cuba 1965 The black king's holiday was cut short by the quiet key move 1. ♔ h2! (faster and prettier than 1.♗ d2+ ♔ g3 2.♖ g5+ ♔ xh4 3.♔ h2!) 1... ♖ xe7 2. ♗ g3# . A final important variety of the quiet key move is that which creates a ZUGZWANG position, in which the enemy has no viable moves and must implode. This idea is of course quite critical in endings (we will see many more ENDGAME FORCING MOVES in Chapter 9):
FCM 6.15
Hector-Miladinovic Malmö 1998 It's all over after 1...e5! , fixing White's center pawns, since after 2. ♕ f3 ♕ e1! White can't retreat with 3.♕ f2? ♘ e2+, leaving only 3.d4 exd4
4.e5 ♕ xf1+ 5. ♕ xf1 ♘ xf1 6. ♔ xf1 ♔ f7 0-1 .
FCM 6.16
Dean-Shabalov Philadelphia 1999 In more complex positions, zugzwangs are scarcer but far from unknown. In this position, White was on the verge of a huge giant- killing but only drew after 1.♘ e3?. A deeper analysis might have shown that Black is almost out of viable moves, since c7, d7, and f6 must be held, and ...♕ xf5 could be met by ♘ g4-h6-f7. Such logic yields the constructive passing move 1. ♔ h2! , stopping future checks:
1... ♕ h4 2. ♖ f7 ♕ g5
Or 2...♕ h5 3.♖ xd7! ♖ xd7 4.♕ xd7+ ♔ xd7 5.♘ xf6+.
3. ♘ xf6 ♕ xf5
Not 3...♘ xf6 4.♕ c7#.
4. ♘ xd7! ♕ xf7
4...♖ xd7 5.♕ f8+!.
5. ♘ b6#
B) Quiet connectors These are tricky, decisive 'quiet' moves in the midst of an 'active' forcing sequence. B1) Sealing off the king's escape square
FCM 6.17
Spassky-Hübner Munich 1979 Spassky caps a delightful attacking game by corralling the king with the quiet crushers 1. ♗ g6!! ♘ xe7 2. ♗ f7! Corridor mate on the h-file is unavoidable.
2... ♘ g4 3. ♖ h3+ ♘ h6 4. ♖ xh6#
FCM 6.18
Fischer-Benko New York 1963 Here is another famous case where White took a quiet 'time out' to seal the fate of Black's king:
1. ♗ xd4! exd4
Against the direct attack 2.e5 Benko had prepared the fine reply 2... f5!, offering a queen trade, but there was no answer to:
2. ♖ f6!!
... when 2...♗ xf6 3.e5 is mate. Black must resign after 2... ♔ g8 3.e5 h6 4. ♘ e2 (stronger than 4.♖ xd6 ♕ xe5!), with 5.♖ xd6 to follow, as knight moves allow 5.♕ f5; 1-0 .
FCM 6.19
Kwilecki-Roslinski Poznan 1954 In this elegant stock example, a silent but deadly threat forces Black to 'self-seal' his own escape square e7:
1. ♕ e5+ ♔ f8
Not 1...♔ g8 2.♖ e8+ or 1...♔ h6 2.♕ f4+.
2. ♕ f6!
Attacking f7.
2... ♕ xe7 3. ♕ h8#
B2) Bringing up the reserves These 'quiet connector' forcing moves take a moment in the midst of the battle, to bring up more troops with lethal impact:
FCM 6.20
Cifuentes Parada-Zviagintsev Wijk aan Zee 1995 Not so convincing is 1...♗ xd5+? 2.♖ xd5 ♕ xd5+ 3.♕ e4, so Black quietly mobilizes the reserves:
1... ♖ e8! 2. ♕ c4 2.♕ d3 ♗ xd5+ 3.♕ xd5 ♕ xe2#. 2... ♕ e3+!! 3. ♗
xe3 ♖ xe3+ 4. ♔ xg4 ♗ c8+ 5. ♔ g5 5.♔ h4 ♗ e7#. 5...h6+ 6. ♔ xh6 ♖ e5! A final quiet forcing move seals off the king's g5 escape; 7...♗ f8# follows; 0-1 .
FCM 6.21
McDonnell-Roiter Northampton 2004 White's explosive incursion rests on a quiet connector, bringing a new key attacker to bear:
1. ♖ xf7+!! ♔ xf7 2. ♕ e6+ ♔ g7 3. ♗ d3! ♕ f2
The only way to stave off mate after 4.♕ xg6+ (5.♖ f1).
4. ♕ xg6+ ♔ f8 5. ♕ h6+ ♔ f7 6. ♗ g6+ 1-0 The end is at hand after 6...
♔ f6 (6...♔ g8 7.♕ h7+ ♔ f8 8.♕ h8#) 7.♗ h7+ with mate in three.
FCM 6.22
Oliff-Keogh Dublin 1964
1... ♕ g3+! 2. ♔ h1
2.fxg3 ♖ xf1+ 3.♔ g2 ♖ 8f2+ 4.♔ h3 ♖ h1# is a stock double rook
mate. But now Black took a draw after 2...♕ h3+, missing a chance to add decisive fuel to the fire:
2...e3!! 3. ♖ a3
There is no stopping Black's next two moves. If 3.f3 ♕ h3+ 4.♔ g1 ♖ xg4+! 5.fxg4 ♖ xf1#.
3... ♕ h3+ 4. ♔ g1 ♖ xf2! 5. ♖ xf2 exf2#
B3) Other quiet connectors
FCM 6.23
Carlsen-I.Sokolov Wijk aan Zee 2013 The ending looks unclear, but with his legendary board sight, Carlsen has foreseen a winning tactical operation involving a quiet connector:
1. ♗ f5+
The clarity of this solution is a no-brainer once we find it, though with its absurdist sense of humor the computer insists that 1.♕ a7+ ♔ e8
2.♕ e3 ♕ b3 3.♕ d4 also somehow wins for White.
1... ♔ e8 2. ♕ c8! 1-0 There's no defense to the fork trick 3.♗ d7+! ♕
xd7 4.♘ f6+.
FCM 6.24
Yukhtman-Yasevich Uzbekistan 1949 Jacob Yukhtman became the terror of the New York chess scene after he emigrated from the former Soviet Union in the early 1970's. Here Black was ready for 1.♕ h7+ ♔ f7 2.♗ h5+ ♔ f6 when White's men don't coordinate. Instead came a fantastic quiet connector:
1. ♕ h7+ ♔ f7 2. ♖ h6!
No wonder Jacob matched Tal blow for blow in his youth! White is lining up his ducks so that now 3.♗ h5+ looks monstrous. (FYI, equal credit goes to Capablanca, who deeply analyzed this sacrificial Giuoco Piano line in the 1920's!)
2... ♖ g8
What else? If 2...♘ xd5 3.♗ h5+ ♔ e7 4.♕ xg7+ ♖ f7 5.♕ xf7#.
3. ♗ h5+ ♔ f8 4. ♖ f6+! gxf6 5. ♕ f7#
Computer eyes extraordinaire! Such difficult quiet moves require creative selection, paired with crisp brute force calculation.
FCM 6.25
Portisch-Berger Amsterdam 1964
1. ♘ xh7! ♔ xh7
If 1...♕ a1+ 2.♖ d1!.
2. ♖ h5+ ♔ g7 Or 2...♔ g8 3.♕ xg6#. 3. ♗ e5+ f6 4. ♖ g5! Optically
'quiet', but in fact the breakthrough on g6 spells instant death. If 4... ♗ f5 5.♕ xf5 Black has only a few checks. 1-0 . Your computer eyes must learn to shed human bias to find the following quiet connector, almost as routinely as you would consider a check or capture, as we have studied a very similar stock idea:
FCM 6.26
Graf-Wurm Augsburg 1953
1. ♗ xc5!
White begins with a loud line-opening sacrifice.
1...bxc5 2. ♕ h6 ♘ d7
Forced, to stop mate on both f8 and g7. If 2...♔ f7, 3.♕ xh7+ ♔ e8
4.♕ h8+ wins.
3. ♖ f7!
Not a check or capture, but this 'soft landing' couldn't pack more force. We noted in Chapter 2 the theme of sacrificing on f7 in order to break through on h7 with the queen.
3... ♔ xf7 4. ♕ xh7+ ♔ e8
4...♔ f6 5.♕ g7#.
5. ♕ xg6#
In another version of the quiet connector, a move which shuns the 'flow' of captures upsets Black's defenses:
FCM 6.27
Kruger-Iskov Dortmund 1978
1. ♗ g5! hxg5 2.hxg5 ♘ xd3+ 3. ♔ f1!
Now the stock corridor mate is on. Also good was 3.♕ xd3 ♕ xg5
4.♕ h3 f6, when White mates from the other side with 5.♘ e7+ ♔ f7
6.♕ e6+ ♔ e8 7.♘ c6#.
3... ♕ xg5 4. ♕ h5! ♕ xh5
4...f6 5.♘ e7#.
5. ♘ e7+! ♔ h7 6. ♖ xh5#
Some quiet connector forcing moves are based on positional factors, initiating such a powerful breakthrough that even 'slow' threats can't be dealt with. As always, computer eyes must do their best to back up such ideas with brute force calculation: (see fragment next page)
FCM 6.28
Berelovich-Jussupow Germany Bundesliga 2002/03
1. ♖ xf7+!! ♖ xf7 2. ♕ xg6!
The extra rook is powerless to stave off White's initiative.
2... ♖ f8
Or 2...♖ f4 3.♕ g7+ ♔ e8 4.♘ xe6.
3. ♕ h7+! ♔ e8 4. ♕ xh5+ ♔ e7 5. ♕ h7+ ♔ e8 6. ♕ g6+ ♔ e7 7. ♕ xe6+ ♔
d8 8. ♕ xd5 1-0 9.♘ e6+ wins.
FCM 6.29
Kobalia-Ghaem Maghami Stepanakert 2004
1. ♘ xd5! cxd5 2. ♖ c6! ♕ d8
Or 2...♖ ac8 3.♖ xf6!. White's initiative remains strong after the most stubborn 2...♕ f5! 3.g4 ♕ g6 4.♗ c3! ♗ d8 5.♕ b7 ♕ d3! 6.♖ e7! ♗ xe7 7.♕ xe7 ♔ g8 8.♗ xf6, e.g. 8...♕ xh3? 9.♕ d7!.
3. ♗ d4!
The key for human eyes was to notice this little forcing retreat, decisively turning up the heat with the threat 4.♖ xe7.
3... ♖ c8
On 3...♖ e8 4.♖ xe7 ♖ xe7 5.♖ xf6! is strongest, with a mating attack.
4. ♖ xc8 ♕ xc8 5. ♕ xc8 ♖ xc8 6. ♖ xe7 and White won the endgame;
1-0 .
FCM 6.30
J.Polgar-I.Sokolov Hoogeveen 2003 Black's counter threats look formidable, indeed, but a wonderfully inspired, calm EST reveals that he's on the ropes:
1. ♘ e4!! ♖ e6
Black's position shrivels like a popped balloon after 1...♕ xa5 2.♕ c4+ ♔ h8 3.♖ xg4; 1...gxf3 2.♕ xf3 ♕ xa5? (2...♕ f7 is more tenacious) 3.♕ h5! ♖ e6 4.♘ g5; or 1...d3 (maybe best) 2.♕ d2, picking off the g-pawn with a big edge (2...gxf3?? 3.♘ f6+).
2. ♖ xg4! With a huge positional and slight material edge due to
Black's vulnerable king and the mastery of the tremendous ♘ e4 over Black's pawns; 2...♕ xa5?? 3. ♕ c4; or 2...c5 3.♘ d2 with a powerful blockade; 1-0 .

3.♗ f2 ♕ xf2+ 4.♔ h1 ♕ xg3 win easily.
Ex 6.2 Sakaev-Kurajica Istanbul 2003 What's left of Black's defense rests solely on the g-file pin after 1.♘ xh5? gxh5 2.♖ xh5+ ♔ g8, which is dispatched in a jiffy with 1. ♔ f1! when the immediate threat is 2.♖ xh5+! and stock mate on h7; 1-0 . Ex 6.3 Laria-Ortega Cuba 1953 After 1... ♘ xd4 2. ♕ xd4 (on 2.♗ xc4, 2...♗ xc5! threatens 3...♘ f3+), the point was the magnificent quiet connector 2... ♕ a7 with the transparent threat of 3...♗ xc5, winning the queen, and the far deeper and more insidious idea 3. ♘ d3 (queen moves meet the same demise) 3... ♗ xd3 4. ♕ xd3 ♗ xc5+ 5. ♔ g2 ♕ h7! , mating on h3!

Ex 6.5 Milov-Luther Merida 2003 White uncorks a tremendous QUIET KEY MOVE which also qualifies as an EST: 1. ♘ a4!! ♖ xh6 No great improvement is 1...♕ xd4 2.♕ xh7+! ♘ xh7 3.♖ e7# or 1...b5 2.cxb6+ ♔ b7 3.bxa7 ♔ xa7 4.♕ xh7+! ♘ xh7 5.♖ f7+ and 6.♖ e8+. 2. ♘ b6! ♕ h3 3. ♖ e7+ ♕ d7 4. ♖ c8# Ex 6.6 Ljubojevic-Portisch Lucerne 1982 It looks like a two-edged battle, but a couple of forcing quiet key moves reveal the salient feature of the position: Black's exposed king. 1. ♕ f1! A bombshell threatening both king (2.♕ xa6+! ♔ xa6
3.♖ xa5#) and queen (2.♖ d3!). 1... ♔ a8 Woefully, Black must
vacate the a7-square for his queen! 2. ♖ a5! He wants bigger game than just the a-pawn. Now 3.♕ xa6+ ♖ a7 4.♕ xc8# looms. 2... ♖ a7
3. ♕ h1+! 1-0
Ex 6.7 Kolarov-Franz Erfurt 1955 Seemingly White must try to grind out a difficult ending, but the inspired key creeper 1. ♖ h4! exploits the awkwardness of Black's bishop, which can only be protected by 1... ♖ bf8 (not 1...♖ xh4
2.gxh4+ ♔ xh4 3.♖ xf6 or 1...♖ hf8 2.♖ g4+ ♔ h6 3.♖ h7#),
setting up the petite combinaison 2. ♖ g4+ ♔ h5 (2...♔ h6 3.♖ g6+)
3. ♖ xf6 ♖ xf6 4. ♖ h4+ 1-0 .
Ex 6.8 Zakhartsov-Lastin Krasnoyarsk 2003 Quite elegant and precise was the quiet connector 1... ♘ xf2! 2. ♔ xf2 e5! Prying the white queen from the defense of the ♖ e3, after which mate looms on f2: 3. ♕ h7 ♖ d2+ 4. ♔ f1 ♕ xe3! 5. ♕ xg8+ ♗ c8 0-1 Ex 6.9 Em.Lasker-Ed.Lasker (variation) New York 1924 Black looks active but has too many unanchored pieces, and a little nudge upends the apple cart: 1. ♕ e3! ♗ b6 2. ♖ c8+ ♔ f7 3. ♘ xe4 ♖ xe4 4. ♕ xe4! A neat stock fork trick. 4... ♕ xe4 5. ♘ g5+ 1-0 Ex 6.10 Smyslov-Oll Rostov-on-Don 1993 A superior feat of computer eyes was the weirdly passive-looking quiet connector 1.g4+ ♔ xe4 2. ♘ f2+ ♔ xf4 3. ♖ g1 , suddenly entombing the wayward rex with the problem-like variations 3...♗ h4
4.♗ d2# and 3...e4 4.♘ h3#; 1-0 .
Ex 6.11 Leko-Kamsky Wijk aan Zee 2006 White could proceed in good positional style with 1.♘ hf5 ♗ xf5 2.♘ xf5 ♘ e8 3.♗ xb5 ♗ xf2+ 4.♔ xf2 ♕ xb5 5.♖ a8, but 5...♘ hf6! with the counterthreat 6...♘ xe4+ makes things messy. Instead, Leko finds a strange-looking quiet forcing key: 1. ♕ f3! With the monstrous smothered mate threat 2.♕ xf7! ♖ xf7 3.♘ hg6#. 1... ♘ f6 Much worse would be 1...♗ e8 2.♘ hf5 or 1...♘ g5?? 2.♗ xg5 hxg5 3.♕ h5 with a corridor mate. 2. ♗ xh6 ♖ a8! Instead of 3.♖ f1 ♘ ce8 4.♗ c1 as in the game, Leko now recommends 3. ♗ xg7+ ♔ xg7 4. ♘ hf5+ ♗ xf5 5. ♘ xf5+ ♔ f8 6. ♖ xa8+ ♕ xa8 7. ♘ xd6 with four pawns and a strong position for the piece; 1-0 . Ex 6.12 Borik-Kachiani Germany Bundesliga 1996/97 White's intended 'tactical solution' 1.♘ xe5 falls victim to the quiet stinger 1...dxe5! 2. ♗ xb5 ♖ a1+ 3. ♗ f1 ♕ a7! , pinning the defender and paralyzing his prey on f1. Even more forcing, by the way, was 3...♖ xf1! 4.♖ xf1 ♕ a7+ 5.♖ f2 ♕ a1+ and mate. 0-1 Ex 6.13 Chigorin-Janowski (variation) Paris 1900 White perceives that the black bishop must guard the d1-h5 diagonal against a fork trick, and finds the little move that topples his resistance: 1.h3! ♗ e6 On 1...♗ c8 (or 1...♗ e2 2.♔ f2!), the stock motif 2.♖ xf6! ♕ xf6 3.♘ h5+ wins the queen, but now comes 2.f5! ♗ xf5 3. ♖ xf6! ♕ xf6 4. ♘ h5+ 1-0 . Ex 6.14 Radulov-Soderborg Helsinki 1961 After 1. ♖ xg7! ♔ xg7 2. ♕ g4+ ♔ h8 the 'loud' 3.♕ g5? ♖ g8 allows Black to defend, but due to the comical paralysis of the black knight, White can quietly proceed with 3. ♕ h5! (or 3.♕ e4!) 1-0 . Ex 6.15 I.Sokolov-Kasparov Wijk aan Zee 1999 In certain positions there is no defense against a deliberate quiet build-up of the attack. That's the case here, regarding the irresistible plan of tripling on the g-file: 1. ♕ f1! ♕ e6 Black scrambles to avoid a winning invasion on g8, but he cannot guard g7 as well. 2. ♕ g2 f6 3. ♖ h3! 1-0 The double mate threat means curtains. Ex 6.16 Polugaevsky-Khasin Moscow 1961 White absorbs the intended counter-blow 1. ♕ h3! ♖ xc3! with the quiet connector 2.f3! after which his threats are golden; not only mate on h7 but also 2...h6 3. ♗ xf6! ♗ xf6 4. ♗ e4 1-0 . Ex 6.17 Fedorov-Lanka Pula 1997 In a very 'loud' position, White discovers a beautiful quiet forcing move: 1. ♕ h6!! With the winning threat 2.♘ h5. 1...e5 Or 1...f5 (1...♗ d8 2.♘ e8!) 2.♘ h5 ♗ d8 3.♘ f6+ ♗ xf6 (3...♔ f7 4.♕ h5+ ♔ e7

If 2...♖ b6 3.♖ b5+! ♔ h7 4.♖ xb6 axb6 5.♖ xf8. 3. ♖ xf7! ♔ xf7 4. ♖ d8+ 1-0 Terrifically alert computer eyes! Ex 6.19 Krivonosov-Grants Soviet Union 1972 Black seems secure with an enemy piece and a queen exchange hanging, but after the quiet key bombshell 1. ♘ a4 it's over before he even knows what hit him: 1... ♕ xd1 Other tries are equally hopeless:

CHAPTER 7
Forcing retreats Study material We now turn our attention to one of the most obvious forms of human bias in analyzing forcing moves. When attacking, it is in our nature to assume that 'forward moves' must be the most aggressive and best. The power of language to influence our thinking may cause us to fall into a dangerous trap. After all, when we think about improving human society, we speak of 'moving forward!' Shouldn't it be the same when we want to improve our attacking chances? Since your computer eyes have already weathered a few battles to overcome human bias, I think that you know the answer by now: the truth of a chess position is not always what seems 'natural'. 'Backward', retreating moves often prove to be objectively the strongest forcing attacking moves! There can be several reasons for this. Sometimes a temporary retreat enables a piece to come forward again to a better attacking square. In other instances, the retreating piece opens up key attacking lanes for fellow chessmen. Some retreats actually create a winning direct threat. Finally, the backpedaling piece may slow down the opponent's threats just long enough to secure time to allow the attack to succeed. This special type of defensive forcing move will be covered in Chapter 9. Computers have an easy life! For them, a backward move is just another brute force option to be analyzed to death. Thus, they have no special problem finding the best attacking move in this position:
FCM 7.1
Kmoch-Van Scheltinga (variation) Amsterdam 1936
1. ♔ h3!!
Both sides promote after 1.♔ g5 f4 or 1.♔ g3 ♔ e3! 2.h6 f4+ 3.♔ g2 ♔ e2!.
1...f4 (or 1...♔ e5 2.♔ g3! ♔ f6 3.♔ f4) 2.h6 f3 3.h7 f2 4. ♔ g2!
The point! White kills the f-pawn's advance.
4... ♔ e3 5. ♔ f1 1-0
FORCING RETREATS may be usefully divided into several types as outlined above: A) Direct threats , in which the retreating piece itself creates a forcing threat which proves decisive. B) Repositioning maneuvers , temporary retreats which enable a piece to come forward again to a more effective attacking square. C) Indirect threats , forcing retreats in which the retreating piece vacates a key line or square, enabling other pieces to execute a winning idea. They become even more effective when the retreating piece also creates a direct threat, in addition to uncovering an indirect one. A) Direct threats Here the retreating piece itself creates a winning threat.
FCM 7.2
Christiansen-Karpov Wijk aan Zee 1993 You can bet your bottom dollar that the champ was pretty embarrassed by the clock-stopping forcing retreat:
1. ♕ d1! Attacking two pieces! 1-0
Players with computer eyes should make two mental notes: First, that retreating right back where you came from may be the strongest attacking move in the changed position! Second, that retreats often dramatically increase the scope of the backpedaling unit. It is well-known that opposite-colored bishops are often an asset when attacking the enemy king, since the defender's bishop can't guard squares attacked by its opposite number.
FCM 7.3
Flohr-Stoltz Warsaw 1935 Here, White alertly finds such a weak spot in the enemy camp:
1. ♗ xf7! ♔ xf7 2. ♖ a6! 1-0
The g6-pawn collapses after this forcing retreat (2...♕ g8 3.♕ d7+ with mate in three) and Black's hopes die with it. Stoltz tried the clever 2...♗ d6!, but lost anyway after 3.♕ d5+ ♔ g7 4.♖ xd6 etc.
FCM 7.4
Bischoff-Bacrot Havana 1998 White may have thought he could wrest the initiative, but his computer eyes clearly failed him as he missed the instantly crushing retreat 1... ♘ b8! 2. ♕ a8 ♖ xa4 0-1 . Some forcing retreats exploit a hanging piece that has become lost in the enemy camp:
FCM 7.5
Tkachiev-Ye Jiangchuan Shanghai 2001
1... ♗ xe4! 2. ♗ xe4 ♕ d8!
Even stronger was 2...♔ f8! with the same motif, and now if 3.♖ e5 ♕ c3!.
3. ♖ e5 ♕ f6!
Forcing the absurd weakening move 4.f4 , when after 4... ♘ c4 White might just as well resign before putting the rook on the silly g5- square, e.g. 5.♖ g5 h6 6.♖ g4 ♘ e3 7.♘ xe3 ♖ c1. 0-1
FCM 7.6
Tal-Benko Skopje 1972 Black's centralized forces look impressive, but White gets in there first with an ugly-looking retreating punch:
1. ♗ xf6+! ♕ xf6 2. ♘ g4! 1-0 , as the exchange goes after 2...♕ xf3
3.gxf3 ♖ g5 4.fxe4, leaving White with a favorable endgame.
FCM 7.7
Short-Vaganian Riga 1995 Black is poised to regain the pawn neatly with 1...♖ xe5, but Short finds a new target:
1. ♕ d2!
Retaining the pawn decisively against any of Black's three defensive tries. On 1...♖ d8 2.♖ xf6; or 1...♕ d7 2.exf6 ♖ exf6 (2...♖ xe1+
3.♕ xe1 ♕ xa4 4.♕ e6+) 3.♖ xf6 ♖ xf6 4.♕ d4; 1...♖ xe5 2.♕
xd5+! ♖ xd5 3.♖ xe7 ♖ d6 (3...♖ f7 4.♖ e6) 4.♖ h3!. 1-0 Knowledge of ending principles plays a key role in evaluating these lines; not just the pawn plus, but also White's huge advantage in king shelter, dooms Black in such major piece positions.
FCM 7.8
Goldstein-Tomilin Soviet Union 1965 A well-known stock forcing retreat involves redeploying the bishop from the a2-g8 diagonal to the also dangerous b1-h7 one (or vice versa!). To knock out the defense 1.♗ d3 f5!, the 'self-blocking' sacrifice 1. ♘ f6+! ♗ xf6 2. ♗ d3! was devised, as on 2...♖ e8 comes the stock mate-in-four 3.♗ xh7+ ♔ h8 4.♗ g6+ ♔ g8 5.♕ h7+ ♔ f8
6.♕ xf7#; 1-0 .
Another example highlights the queen's particular proclivity for powerful forcing retreats:
FCM 7.9
Sethuraman-Trent Douglas 2018 White has noticed a key tactical detail; a retreating fork animates the ideal Sicilian attacking move:
1. ♘ d5! ♕ b8
Forced, as Black is busted after 1...♕ d7 2.♘ b6+ or 1...exd5 2.♕ h3+.
2. ♕ xf7 exd5 3. ♗ f1
White uses a second forcing retreat, then a third, to bring home the point cleanly.
3... ♖ xh2 4. ♕ xg7 ♕ c7
If 4...dxe4 White's point was 5.♗ h3+! ♖ xh3 6.♕ g4+.
5. ♕ xc7+ ♔ xc7
And now 6. ♖ xd5! was decisive, though White prevailed with 6.exd5 ♘ b4 7.♘ d4... 1-0 .
FCM 7.10
Monticelli-Horowitz Syracuse 1934
1... ♕ xa1
The distinguished American IM played the tragic 1...♖ xe4??.

Computer eyes remind us to include all the squares on the board in our calculations - a function of good board sight, meaning the ability to accurately visualize where the pieces are, and what they can do, in each position during calculation.
FCM 7.11
Karpov-Taimanov Leningrad 1977 Black's forward thrust sets the stage for a lethal retreat, directly threatening mate:
1... ♖ a1! 2. ♖ b1
Allows an ingenious shot, but not much better was 2.♕ e2, e.g. 2... ♕ xd5 3.♖ b5 (3.♖ b2 ♘ e3; 3.♖ f3 ♘ d4) 3...♕ e4! 4.♕ f2 ♕ d3!.
2... ♘ g3+! 3.hxg3 ♖ a8! 0-1
The opening of the h-file culminates in a stock corridor mate after
4...♖ h8.
FCM 7.12
Maroczy-Romih San Remo 1930 Black's counterplay is extraordinarily close to winning, as 1.♕ g5?? fails to 1...♖ xh3+ 2.♔ g1 ♕ d4+, while 1.♖ g8+? ♖ xg8 2.♕ h5+ ♔ d7 3.e8♕ + ♖ xe8 4.♕ xe8+ ♔ c7 lets the king slip away. But White turns the game around with a marvelous forcing retreat:
1. ♕ h5!!
Now the threatened double check on g8 decides, e.g. 1...♔ d7
2.e8♕ +! ♖ xe8 3.♕ h7+ and mate, or 1...♖ xg2+ 2.♖ xg2+ check!
2...♖ xh5 3.♖ xb2.

FCM 7.13
Kasparov-Topalov Wijk aan Zee 1999 Black is playing for mate himself with 1...♕ d3+, but Kasparov's impeccable computer eyes gave him the rare ability to flatly out- calculate world class GM's:
1. ♗ f1!! ♖ d2
Otherwise it's mate after 1...♕ xf1 2.♕ c2+ ♔ e1 3.♖ e7+ or 1...♕ e6 2.♕ c1#.
2. ♖ d7!! ♖ xd7 3. ♗ xc4 bxc4 4. ♕ xh8 1-0
FCM 7.14
Vaibhav-Bellin Gibraltar 2019 Invading distant territory is a crucial aim in chess, but sometimes the attacker gets cut off and captured behind enemy lines. In such cases retreats may serve both to set the snare, and capture the rabbit:
1. ♕ d1!
White chooses the most clear and direct approach.
1...e4
If 1...♕ a3 the lady is cut down by 2.♘ b1 ♕ xa2 3.♖ c2 ♕ a1 4.♗ c3.
2. ♖ h3! d5
Even the desperate 2...e3 3.fxe3 ♕ a3 4.♕ c2! ♕ a5 (4...♕ b5 5.♘ b5) doesn't save the sorry femme: 5.♘ d5 ♕ d8 6.♘ xf6+ ♕ xf6
7.♕ xh7+ ♔ f7 8.♖ f1.
3. ♖ c2 1-0 The black queen is swallowed up by the direct forcing
retreat 3...♕ a3 4.♘ b1.
FCM 7.15
Navara-Ding Liren Shamkir 2019 In the ending, knights are particularly vulnerable to being cut off and stranded on an open board. White avoided a long technical phase with 1. ♖ b1! 1-0 . The knight is marooned after 1...♔ f8 (1...♗ d2 2.♖ a2! or 1...♗ c1
2.♔ d3) 2.♖ e1 ♘ c1 3.f4! ♘ a2 4.♖ a1.
B) Repositioning maneuvers In these crucial maneuvers, a piece retreats in order to threaten to come forward to a stronger attacking square. This motif is especially important for knights, which often utilize strategic retreats in order to access key target squares, but any piece (except, of course, the pawn) may utilize repositioning play.
FCM 7.16
Ryrakovsky-Paschall Boston 1997 If a chess move can be called 'humorous', it would have to hold a paradox like the tremendous attacking move 1... ♘ h8!! 0-1 . This is the only way for the knight to gain clean access to the decisive g6- square, trapping the ♖ h4.
FCM 7.17
Fischer-Darga West Berlin exhibition game, 1960 A blistering reorganization puts the finger on Black's vulnerability:
1. ♗ c1! ♕ e1+
Black is quite lost on 1...♘ e5 2.♖ e3! ♕ xf5 3.♕ b5 (threatening
4.♖ xe5! ♕ xe5 5.♖ a7+) 3...♖ hd8 4.♖ a7+ ♔ d6 5.♗ a3+ ♔ e6

2. ♖ f1 ♕ xc3 3. ♗ f4+ ♔ b7 4. ♕ b5 1-0
The threat 5.♕ a6# is decisive.
FCM 7.18
Kasparov-Leko Linares 2001 Computer eyes find a savvy knight dance, which breaks up Black's center and launches a winning kingside invasion:
1.d6+ ♔ h8 2. ♘ c5! ♗ c6 3. ♘ d3! ♕ xc3 4. ♘ xe5
From its killer outpost the knight paralyzes Black's forces!
4... ♗ e4
4...♗ b7 5.♕ h5.
5. ♘ f7+ ♔ h7 6. ♘ g5+
Winning the exchange should not satisfy White's attacking lust.

FCM 7.19
Polugaevsky-Szilagyi Moscow 1960
1. ♖ g1+ ♔ h6
Confining the black king to the risky h-file corridor sets the stage for an elegant rook repositioning maneuver:

Or 2...♔ h5 3.♖ xh7#.
3. ♖ d3 1-0
FCM 7.20
Tyomkin-Yezersky Beer-Sheva 2000 Black relies on the defensive resource 1.♗ xg7? ♕ f3+ 2.♖ g2 ♕ xg2+! 3.♔ xg2 ♖ xg7+, winning, but despite the extra piece, he has no answer to the following repositioning shot:
1. ♕ f5!
With the lethal threat 2.♕ d7+. Since 1...♗ xh6 2.♕ e6 mates, Black has nothing better than the desperate try 1... ♕ xe4+ , but soon resigns after the 'video replay' 2. ♕ xe4 ♗ xh6 3. ♕ h7+ ♗ g7 4. ♕ f5! 1- 0 .
FCM 7.21
Hever-Siklaj Hungary 1975 In this beautiful example, White finds an unusual knight repositioning maneuver ending in an ideal mate:
1. ♖ xf7+!! ♗ xf7 2. ♘ f5+ ♔ e6 3. ♘ g7+ ♔ e7 4. ♗ d8#
Far from unknown is the following type of repositioning maneuver, in which a series of checks allows the queen to retreat with tempo to a more effective distant attacking post: (see fragment next page)

2. ♕ h4+! ♔ g7 3. ♕ g3+ ♔ h7 4. ♕ h3+! ♔ g7 5. ♖ xf5!
The point of all these backward checks was to allow this powerful capture with tempo, irresistibly threatening 6.♖ g5+.
5...fxe5
No cause for celebration was 5...♖ h8 6.♖ g5+ ♔ f7 7.♗ h5+ ♖ xh5 8.♕ xh5+ ♔ f8 9.♕ h8+ ♔ f7 10.♖ g7#.

Cameron-Millstone correspondence game, 2003 A deeply calculated repositioning sacrifice results in a surprise mating net:
1... ♖ xb7!! 2. ♕ e5+ ♘ f6! 3. ♕ xd6 ♘ g4+ 4. ♔ h3 ♘ xf2+ 5. ♔ h4
The white queen is a goner in the pretty variation 5.♔ h2 ♖ b1 6.g4 (6.♕ e5+ ♔ h7 7.g4 ♘ xg4+) 6...♖ h1+ 7.♔ g3 ♘ e4+.
5...g5+ 6. ♔ h5 ♖ b1 7. ♕ e5+ ♔ h7 0-1
A tough one for unwary ' human' eyes; the 'routine' interpolation 2... ♘ f6 launched the winning attack. C) Indirect forcing retreats In the next examples, an accurate retreating shot uncovers a decisive threat by another piece or pieces.
FCM 7.24
Kramnik-Morozevich Moscow 2014 In a triumph of great selection (noticing hidden options), the great champion - now in his victory lap - found an astonishing 'only move' -the winning indirect forcing retreat 1. ♘ h3!! , protecting both the R and the h6-pawn, while discovering winning threats on the g-file:
1... ♕ xh3
Black has plenty of nothing: if 1...♘ e8 2.hxg7 ♕ xh3 3.♕ d2 is a slow death. 2. ♖ xg7+ ♔ h8 3. ♗ xf6 ♕ xh6 Or 3..♕ e3+ 4.♔ b1 ♖ e6 5.♖ g3+.
4. ♖ g6+ 1-0

Filguth-De la Garza Mexico 1980 Are your computer eyes sufficiently trained to find the wondrous shot
1. ♕ h1!! and the two brute force variations that make it the strongest
attacking move on the board? On 1...♕ h5 2.g4! the h-pawn is guarded, while on 1... ♕ f6 2. ♗ g5! the queen breaks through to h7 after 2...hxg5 3.hxg5. 1-0 What gives many indirect forcing retreats their pop is not only the threat they uncover, but the secondary intentions of the backpedaling piece:
FCM 7.26
Zagorskis-Sadler Elista 1998
1... ♖ e4! 2. ♖ c3
The mighty stock mating threat 2.fxe4 ♗ e3+ 3.♕ f2 ♕ g3+ allows Black's rook to reposition decisively.
2... ♖ h4 3.f4
What else? The king is still too exposed on 3.♕ xh4 ♕ xh4.
3... ♕ h1+ 4. ♔ f2 ♖ h2+ 5. ♔ e3 ♕ e4+ and 6...♗ xf4+ wins. 0-1
FCM 7.27
Vilela-Spiridonov Varna 1977 In an unusual twist, the retreating piece cuts off the bishop's support in a shocking manner, while indirectly setting up back rank threats:
1... ♘ f6!! 0-1
After 2.♖ xd8+ (on other rook moves simply 2...♔ xg7) 2...♘ xd8, the mating threat 3...♕ e1+ swallows the ♗ g7. In the next two examples, a forcing retreat combines a direct threat with the indirect unleashing of a powerful battery: (see fragment next page)
FCM 7.28
Magerramov-Panchenko Bad Wörishofen 1994 Swift and decisive was the 'back-attack' 1. ♘ e3! ♖ 4c6 2. ♘ xf5 ♘ f7 3. ♕ xd8+ ♖ xd8 4. ♖ xd8+ ♘ xd8 5. ♖ e8+ 1-0 .
FCM 7.29
Christiansen-Nunn San Francisco 1995 White unleashed a devastating battery with a surprise retreat:
1. ♘ h4! ♕ h5
The best try. 1...♖ xf4 2.♘ xg6+, 1...♕ c2 2.♕ xf8+ ♗ xf8 3.♖ xf8+ ♔ g7 4.♖ 1f7#, and 1...♕ e8 2.♕ xf8+ ♗ xf8 3.♖ xf8+ ♕ xf8 4.♖ xf8+ ♔ g7 5.♖ f1 all lose outright.
2. ♕ xf8+! ♗ xf8 3. ♖ xf8+ ♔ g7
Now Christiansen got a winning position (though he later blundered and drew) with the brilliant 4.♗ h6+ ♔ xh6 (4...♕ xh6 5.♖ 1f7#)
5.♖ 1f6+ ♕ g6 6.♘ xg6 hxg6 7.h4, but simpler was 4. ♘ f5+! ♔ xf8
(4...♔ g6 5.♖ g8+ ♔ f7 6.♘ h6#) 5. ♘ g3+ , emerging with a full extra piece. 1-0 In some instances, the indirect forcing retreat vacates a key square, rather than a key line: (see fragment next page)
FCM 7.30
Tal-Unzicker Stockholm 1960/61 The point of 1. ♗ d2 ! was to forcefully give the knight access to g5 after 1...b4 . Similar is 1...♗ b4 2.♗ xf7+! while 1...♕ a4 2.♗ b3! ♕ xe4 allows the stock fork trick 3.♗ xf7+! ♔ xf7 4.♘ g5+.
2. ♗ xf7+! ♔ xf7 3. ♕ b3+ ♔ f8 3...♔ g6 4.♘ h4+ is a free ticket to an

FCM 7.31
Ajanski-Popov Boras 1980 The forcing pullback 1. ♘ g4! not only menaces 2.♕ h6#, but the forced 1... ♔ f8 (1...♔ xh7 2.♕ h6+ ♔ g8 3.♘ f6+ is a stock mate) allows White to stuff the vacated square with the blow 2. ♕ f6!! ♗ xf6
3.exf6 1-0 .
Here, the forcing retreat takes the form of a winning diversion sacrifice:
FCM 7.32
Dreev-Svidler Halkidiki 2002
1. ♖ c4! ♕ xc4
The black queen is diverted from the crucial e7-square, but on 1...♕ a3, simply 2.♖ e4! repositions the rook decisively (2...♘ f6 3.♕ d8+).

Ex 7.10 Makarichev-Alburt Ashkhabad 1978 White crowned a decisive attack with the elegant repositioning maneuver 1. ♗ d1! . 1.♖ f4 is also lethal: 1...♘ d7 2.♖ xf6 gxf6 3.♕ e7+ ♔ c8 4.♗ e6, picking up the bishop. 1... ♕ a6 If 1...♘ d7 2.♕ e8+! ♖ xe8 3.♖ xe8#. 2. ♗ g4 ♕ b7 3. ♕ e8+! 1-0 Ex 7.11 Vallejo Pons-Karjakin Dos Hermanas 2003 A pair of sharp direct withdrawing threats make short work of Black's scattered army: 1. ♗ e3! ♕ g7 2. ♗ f3! ♘ c3 The stage is now set for the forward dagger thrust 3. ♗ h6! , winning the queen; 1-0 . Ex 7.12 Tolush-Kotov (variation) Moscow 1945 White mustn't wait a moment to unleash the power of the dark- squared ♗ with 1.f7!! since on 1... ♗ xe4+ he has the decisive indirect forcing retreat 2. ♘ f3+! 1-0 . Ex 7.13 Christiansen-Zhu Chen Seattle 2001 A precise retreat carries a deadly indirect threat to snare the black ♕ : 1. ♕ d1! Sealing off the queen's escape route in the line 1...♗ xe4
2.♗ xe4 ♖ xe4 3.♖ h3!. 1...f5 2.e5 ♗ e7 3. ♗ e1! A second indirect
forcing retreat sets up a winning discovery. 3... ♗ d8 4. ♖ xg7 1-0 Ex 7.14 Kubanek-Kopriva Prague 1952 In this curious demonstration, the queen jumps in, only to retreat back to where she came from with decisive effect! 1. ♕ h6+! Mistaken is the seductive 1.♘ h5+? gxh5 2.♕ g5+ ♔ h8 3.♕ f6+ ♔ g8 4.♗ h6 ♖ g4. 1... ♔ xf6 2. ♕ h4+!! Marvelous! The direct forcing retreat leads to a stock mate after 2...♔ g7 3.♗ h6+ and 4.♕ f6, while scarcely better is 2... ♔ f5 3. ♕ g5+ ♔ e4 4. ♖ e1+ ♔ d5 5. ♖ xe5+ 1-0 . Ex 7.15 Dvoirys-Kortchnoi Beer-Sheva 2004 Deceptively powerful was the repositioning shot 1... ♗ f5! when Black makes hay on the b1-h7 diagonal after 2.♖ h6 ♗ d3+ 3.♔ e1 (3.♘ e2 axb4) 3...♘ xd4; or 2.♖ h1 ♗ e4 (threatening 3...♘ xd4), while
2. ♖ xf7 ♔ e6! created a winning material and positional edge; 0-1 .
Ex 7.16 Tal-Filip (variation) Moscow 1967 The tremendous and thematic repositioning retreat 1. ♘ g4!! envisions the stock mate 1...gxh5 (or 1...f5) 2.♘ h6#. No help is 1... f6 2.♗ xf6!, or 1... ♘ d7 2. ♗ xg6! fxg6 (2...hxg6 3.♕ h8#) 3. ♘ h6+ ♔ f8 4. ♕ f3+ 1-0 .
CHAPTER 8
Zwischenzugs Study material The ZWISCHENZUG , or 'in-between forcing move', has the reputation of being the most difficult tactic for strong players to find. Maybe the deepest form of human bias in chess calculation is the idea that when I capture your piece, you must recapture it and 'even the score'. There are two good reasons why we all carry this natural assumption. The first is, of course, because it's true probably 95% of the time! The second reason is because it saves time and trouble in analysis. When we calculate difficult variations, it makes life much easier if we assume that 'routine' trades are forced. Unfortunately, this isn't always the case! Your computer eyes have a difficult but amazing mission in this chapter: to become aware of the possibility that when your opponent takes your piece, you may have a much stronger move than retaking. Instead of recapturing right away, powerful computer eyes demand that you think a moment, to see if you have any other very forcing moves, which may even steal the game when the opponent least expects it. Zwischenzugs occur when one player rejects an 'obvious, forced' recapture in favor of a different forcing move, usually a check, mating threat or attack on the enemy queen. Like Chapter 5's 'equal or stronger threats', they reject 'knee-jerk' defensive play in favor of checking for stronger forcing moves. But in-between forcing moves differ from EST's in that the opponent has already carried out his capturing 'threat'. The zwischenzug is really best categorized as a special type of surprise forcing move. More than any other type of forcing move, it requires us to overcome the human bias toward routine, 'normal' play. When grandmasters miss a winning in- between forcing move, it is usually because they simply assume that the opponent must take back, and 'forget' about other options. In order for your computer eyes to master the power of the zwischenzug, you will have to work on creativity, and be willing to look 'outside the box' of normal play. Now I will give you the real key to finding the winning zwischenzug, which luckily is the same central principle we have discussed throughout the book for improving your calculation: always examine the most forcing moves first . Once you have read this chapter and understand how in-between forcing moves work in master play, you will realize that winning zwischenzugs are even more forcing than routine recaptures , and thus should be examined first by discerning computer eyes!
FCM 8.1
Singh-Sahu Kokhikode 1994 White is relying on the trick 1...♗ xf3 2.♗ xf3 ♘ xf3+ 3.♕ xf3 ♕ xd6
4.c5, to complete development with cxb6 and O-O. Instead, after 1...
♗ xf3 2. ♗ xf3 came the crushing zwischenzug 2... ♗ d4!! , exploiting the fork trick 3.♕ xd4 ♘ xf3+, when suddenly White can practically resign due to the threats on d6, c3 and f3. This chapter examines five different types of zwischenzug: A) In-between checks B) In-between mate threats C) In-between queen attacks D) Promotion-based zwischenzugs E) Unusual zwischenzugs A) In-between checks This is the most common type of zwischenzug. A routine recapture is replaced by a winning in-between forcing check leading to mate or gain of material.
FCM 8.2
Eingorn-Van Wely Halkidiki 2002 A diversionary forcing move to a unit guarding a piece may set the stage for a strong zwischenzug:
1. ♕ f3! ♕ xf3
There was a mate threat on f7.
2. ♗ xc5+! ♔ g8 3.gxf3 1-0
FCM 8.3
Volkov-Vitiugov St Petersburg 2017 Black derives great pleasure from White's failure to resign a lost cause. In the main line Black plays seven in-between checks ending in mate, never bothering to recapture the queen!
1... ♘ xd5!
The most decisive. In the game White resigned one move before mate: 2.cxd5 ♕ xd5+ 3.♕ c4 ♕ xd2 4.♖ ed1 ♖ xb2+ 5.♔ a3 ♕ b4+ 6.♕ xb4 cxb4+ 7.♔ xa4 ♘ c5+. But we prefer the parade of in- between checks:
2. ♕ xd4 ♘ b4+ 3. ♔ a3 ♘ c2+ 4. ♔ xa4
4.♔ a2 - same result, less fun.
4... ♖ b4+ 5. ♔ a5 ♗ c7+ 6. ♔ xa6 ♘ b8+ 7. ♔ a7 ♘ c6+ 8. ♔ a8 ♖ b8# 0-1!
FCM 8.4
Miagmarsuren-Bisguier Tallinn 1971 Here the diversion theme is aided by the f-file pin and pressure on the b1-h7 diagonal:
1. ♖ e1! ♖ xe1
Likewise, 1...♗ xd3 2.♖ xf8 ♖ xe1 3.♔ xe1 ♗ xc2 4.♖ f7+ is hopeless.
2. ♖ xf5! 1-0 . The in-between check 2...♖ xf5 3.♗ xf5+ steals a
piece, while on 2...♖ fe8 3.♖ e5+! decides.
FCM 8.5
Nijboer-Bauer Wijk aan Zee II 1999 Shown in one of its simplest forms here, the in-between check allows White to initiate discovered action on the d-file while picking off a vital pawn:
1. ♗ xf5! ♖ xd1
Or 1...♖ b8 2.♗ b1.
2. ♗ e6+! ♔ f8 3. ♖ xd1 and White nurses his edge to victory, e.g. 3...
b2 4.♗ d5 ♗ d4 5.♔ f1 ♘ d7 (tougher may be 5...♘ xd5 6.cxd5 ♔ e7) 6.♗ e4 ♘ c5 7.♗ c2; 1-0 .
FCM 8.6
Alekhine-Tartakower San Remo 1930 White is clearly better with his strong passed a-pawn, but 1.♔ e3 allows 1...♘ d6! and 2...♘ c4+. Alekhine found a petit combinaison winning a pawn, based on an in-between check:
1. ♗ xe4+!
Flipping the move order with 1.g4+ ♔ f4 2.♗ xe4! was also interesting, e.g. 2...♖ xc5 3.dxc5 ♗ xe4 4.a5.
1... ♗ xe4 2.g4+! ♔ f6
The point is 2...♔ f4 3.♘ e6#.
3. ♘ xe4+ ♔ e6 4. ♔ e3 ♘ d6 5. ♔ d3 with good winning chances; 1-0 .
FCM 8.7
Gligoric-Kavalek Skopje 1972 A pair of zwischenzugs neatly conclude a winning attack:
1. ♘ h6!
Cleverly exploiting the back rank on 1...♕ xh6 2.♖ e8+, while 1...♖ f6 (1...♖ g5 allows the fork trick 2.♕ xg5! ♕ xg5 3.♘ xf7+) allows
2.♖ e8+ ♔ g7 3.♖ g8+ ♔ xh6 4.♕ h4+ ♕ h5 5.♕ xf6+ ♕ g6 6.♕
h4+ ♕ h5 7.♕ f4+ ♕ g5 8.♕ xg5#. White could also win with 1.d6! or by flipping the move order with 1.♖ e8+.
1... ♕ xg3 2. ♖ e8+!
Mopping up with the further in-between check 2...♔ g7 3.♘ xf5+!; 1- 0 .
FCM 8.8
Tal-Geller Riga 1958 Even 'hall-of-fame' tacticians have been tripped up by this elusive zwischenzug: 1. ♖ e7! ♕ xe7 2. ♕ g4+! 1-0 .
FCM 8.9
Reinderman-M.Gurevich Escaldes 1998 In-between checks play a special role in attacks against the enemy king, in which every forcing option must be considered with the utmost precision. White need not fathom the uncertainties of the recapture 1.♗ xe4? when a little check first clarifies everything:
1. ♗ h7+! ♔ h8
1...♔ f7 2.♕ e7#.
2. ♗ xe4+ ♔ g8 3. ♗ d5+ ♔ f8
On 3...♗ e6 4.♗ xe6+ ♖ xe6 5.d7 ♗ f6 6.d8♕ + wins.
4. ♕ f4+ ♔ e8 5. ♕ f7+ ♔ d8 6. ♕ g8+ ♖ e8 7. ♕ xg7 1-0
FCM 8.10
Johnston-Marshall Chicago 1899 In a rare tactical lapse against a weaker player, the American tactical genius interpolated ...♘ xg3?? and got stung by a 'zwisch':
1. ♘ e7+! ♔ h8 2. ♘ g6+! hxg6 3.hxg3+ and mate next; 1-0 .
FCM 8.11
Timman-Lobron Sarajevo 1984 Due to the often utterly forcing nature of checks, (remember our introductory definition of a forcing move as one that limits the opponent's options ), even such high priorities as the recapture of a queen can sometimes be decisively delayed by discriminating computer eyes:
1. ♕ xd6+! ♔ xd6 2. ♘ c4+ ♔ c7 3.d6+! Delaying ♘ xb6 for one more
forcing move allows White to keep an extra piece. 1-0
FCM 8.12
Gheorghiu-Uhlmann Sofia 1967 Black is relying on a so-called 'desperado' tactic:
1. ♕ xf6! ♕ xe4!
Not 1...gxf6 2.♖ g4+ ♔ h8 3.♗ xc6. Both sides initiate a sort of suicide mission with the queen, trying to take down as many opposing units as possible before getting captured. Black wins after the routine recapture 2.♗ xe4?? gxf6, but loses to the in-between checks 2. ♕ xf7+! ♖ xf7 3.exf7+ ♔ xf7 4. ♗ xe4 when none of Black's significant units escape the pyre. 1-0 . B) In-between mate threats Decisive mate threats take the place of routine recaptures.
FCM 8.13
Pilaj-Lendwai Austria 2004/05 White has a very strong attack with the automatic recapture 1.bxc3, but computer eyes saw a chance to take the royal fortress now with a stock mate threat:
1. ♘ xg6!! ♘ h7 If 1...fxg6 2.♕ xe6+ ♔ f8 3.♖ h8 mates. 2. ♖ xh7! ♔
xh7 Or 2...fxg6 3.♕ xe6+! ♔ xh7 4.♖ f3! with a corridor mate on h3.
3. ♕ h4+ ♔ xg6 4.g4!
A quiet forcing move, with the twin mate threats 5.f5+ and 5.♕ h5#, finishes Black off.
4... ♗ xg5 5. ♕ h5+! ♔ f6 6. ♕ xg5#
FCM 8.14
Fischer-R.Byrne New York 1966 How alert must our computer eyes be, when arguably the greatest human tactician ever captured a knight on c6, overlooking a winning in-between mate threat?
1... ♗ d6! 2.f4?!
On 2.h3, 2...♗ xe2 wins the exchange.
2... ♗ xe2 3. ♖ f2 ♘ g4 0-1
Black wins a rook due to the stock mate threat 4.♖ xe2 ♕ xh2+ 5.♔ f1 ♕ h1#.
FCM 8.15
Bilek-Farago Budapest 1973 With 1. ♗ xe6! White had in mind not a rook trade, but a mating net after 1... ♖ xd1 2. ♕ a8+! ♔ h7 3. ♗ xf7! h5 4. ♕ g8+ ♔ h6 5. ♕ h8# .
FCM 8.16
Nakamura-Kallio Budapest 2002 Black is angling for the stock sacrifice 1...♘ g3+ 2.hxg3 hxg3 3.♕ xg3 ♗ b6, threatening a corridor mate, but White can barely hold with 4.♕ h3! (4.♖ f2? ♕ d4!) 4...♕ d8! (4...♖ h8? 5.♗ f8+!) 5.f4 ♖ h8 6.fxe5. Computer eyes then make the key deduction: he can flip the move order and insert the winning zwischenzug:
1... ♘ g3+ 2.hxg3 ♗ b6!!
Now 3.♕ e1 hxg3 4.♕ xg3 ♖ h8+ wins the queen, so forced is:
3. ♗ c5 hxg3 4. ♕ e3 ♖ h8+ 5. ♔ g1 ♕ e7!! 0-1 .
A monstrous surprise forcing move! Black makes a new queen on
6.♗ xe7 ♗ xe3+ 7.♖ f2 gxf2+ 8.♔ f1 ♖ h1+, or delivers stock mate
after 6.♗ xb6 ♖ h1+! 7.♔ h2 ♕ h4+ 8.♔ g1 ♕ h2#.
FCM 8.17
Schonbauer-Despotovic Yugoslavia 1974 White has a defendable position after the 'normal' 1...♕ xd6 2.♖ e1. What he just failed to grasp is that the critical position had already arrived:
1... ♘ f3+! 2. ♔ h1 ♗ h3!!
The in-between mate threat wins at least the exchange (3.♖ g1 ♘ xg1 4.♕ f1 ♕ xd6) or more after 3.gxh3 ♕ xd6 with the stock threat
4...♕ xh2#; 0-1 .
FCM 8.18
Lebedev-Gonak Tulsk 1938 The zwischenzug is often a key link in a chain of variations:
1. ♘ h6+! ♔ h8!
The first point is the stock back-rank diversion sac 1...gxh6 2.♖ f8+! ♖ xf8 3.♕ xe6+.
2. ♖ f8+!! ♖ xf8
The beauty of the combination lies in the fact that Black now threatens mate on f1, but two critical in-between forcing moves finally swing the verdict:
3. ♗ xf8! ♖ xf8!
Renewing the mate threat on f1, but finally, 4. ♘ f7+! picks off the loose queen or mates on the back row after 4...♖ xf7 5.♖ b8+. 1-0
FCM 8.19
Luther-A.Petrosian Schwerin 1999 We have seen earlier how one tempo may make the difference between a winning attack and defeat. It makes sense, then, that sometimes we have more important things to do than recapturing a piece:
1. ♗ h3!! ♕ e3 The point is the in-between mate threat 1...♘ xd3 2.♗
e6+ ♔ h8 3.♕ g6! and 4.♕ xh5#! A better defense is 2...♖ f7! 3.♕ f5! ♗ f6! (3...♖ f8 4.g6 ♗ f6 5.gxf7+ ♖ xf7 6.♕ g6! ♕ f2 7.♕ xf7+ ♔ h8 8.♕ xh5#) 4.gxf6 ♕ f2! when only computer eyes (à la Fritz) foresee the mating lines 5.♗ xf7+ ♔ xf7 (or 5...♔ f8!? 6.fxg7+ ♔ e7 (or 6...♔ xg7 7.♖ hg1+ ♔ f8 8.♖ g8+ and mate) 7.♕ e6+ ♔ d8
8.♕ e8+! ♔ c7 9.♕ c6+ ♔ d8 10.g8♕ + ♔ e7 11.♕ b7+ ♔ f6 12.♕
g5# or 12.♕ g6#) 6.♕ d7+ with mate soon. 2. ♕ g6 ♕ xf3 position after 2...♕ xf3
3. ♘ xc1?
Winning was 3.♗ e6+ ♔ h8 4.♔ xc1 (4.♘ xc1? now meets with 4... e4! and 5...♘ e5. Now White is threatening 5.♖ df1) 4...♘ e3 5.♖ de1 with the decisive threat of 6.♖ h3! after which Black has to let go of h5.
3... ♘ e3?
3...♖ f7! would have defended neatly to a draw. Now White is
winning again.
4. ♗ e6+ ♔ h8 5. ♖ df1! ♘ xf1 6. ♖ xf1 1-0
FCM 8.20
Kornfilt-Hukel correspondence game, 1964 The shot 1. ♘ f6!! threatens 2.♕ g7#, killing Black after 1...♕ xb2+
2.♔ h1 ♖ g8 3.♖ xg7!, or winning a whole rook via the in-between
back rank mate threat 1... ♕ xg4 2. ♘ xe8! 1-0 .
FCM 8.21
Wirthensohn-Lin Ta Novi Sad 1990 Black's last move ...dxc4 tried to ease his development woes after
1.♘ xc4 ♗ d5 or 1.bxc4 ♗ xe5 and 2...♖ d7. These designs were
crushed by a 'zwisch':
1.d5! wins the ♗ e6 on account of the stock mate threat 1...cxd5 2. ♘
xg6+! hxg6 3. ♕ h6+ ♔ g8 4. ♕ xg7# . Even guarding g6 with 1...♗ f7 allows some nice stock mates: 2.♕ h6!! (anyway) 2...♗ xh6 (2...♔ g8 3.♕ xg7+! ♔ xg7 4.♘ g4+ e5
5.♗ xe5+ ♕ f6 6.♗ xf6+ ♔ g8 7.♘ h6#) 3.♘ xf7+ ♔ g8 4.♘ xh6#.
1...♗ f7 2.♕ h6!! ♗ f6! spoils the fun a little bit, but White wins
easily with 3.dxc6.
FCM 8.22
Damjanovic-Lehmann Beverwijk 1966 Seemingly lost, White reportedly created quite a stir in the tournament hall with a star swindle:
1. ♗ g5!! ♕ xa3 2. ♗ xe7! , stealing a piece with the mate threat on f8.
1-0 A better but insufficient try was 1...♗ xc5 2.♕ xc5 ♗ f7 3.♖ xf7! ♔ xf7 4.♕ xd5+ ♔ g6 5.♕ xa8 ♔ xg5 6.♕ e4! ♕ xb2 7.h4+ ♔ h5 8.♕ xh7+ ♔ g4 9.♕ e4+ ♔ h5 10.e6 ♕ b8+ (10...a3 11.♕ e5+ and
12.e7) 11.♕ e5+ ♕ xe5+ 12.dxe5 ♔ g6 13.h5+, winning the race.
C) In-between queen attacks The transformative magic of zwischenzugs is on full display in this recent encounter:
FCM 8.23
Santos Ruiz-Wemmers Gibraltar 2019
1. ♘ g3! ♗ xf1 2. ♘ f5!
Computer and human alike see nothing amiss for Black, until the power of this zwischenzug begins to sink in...
2... ♕ d8
2...♕ e5 fails to the second intermezzo 3.f4!.
3. ♘ e4!
White's real point - the destruction of Black's king shelter is amazingly deadly.
3... ♗ a6
If 3...d6 4.♘ xg7!.
4. ♗ xf6
There are other ways now, but this is crystal clear:
4...gxf6 5. ♕ b3!
Threatening mate in two.
5... ♔ h8 6. ♘ ed6! 1-0 Black loses the queen or gets mated, e.g. 6...♕
c7 7.♕ g3 ♖ g8 8.♘ xf7#.
FCM 8.24
I.Ivanov-Rogers Lucerne 1982 Black has relied on the zwischenzug 1... ♘ e2! to save his loose knight, but it's hard to believe that this humble in-between queen attack leads to mate or win of the queen!
2. ♕ e3
Clearly the intended refutation, as 2.♕ b4 (or 2.♕ h4) allows the mating sequence 2...♕ d1+ 3.♔ h2 ♕ g1+ 4.♔ h3 ♕ h1#.
2... ♘ g3+!
White must have overlooked this lethal in-between check.
3. ♔ g1 ♕ d1+ 4. ♔ f2 On 4.♔ h2 the fork 4...♘ f1+ bags the queen.
4... ♘ h1# A most unusual and beautiful mate!
FCM 8.25
Shirov-Gelfand Dortmund 2002 Black has played for imbalance with the exchange sacrifice ...♖ xe5, hoping for counterplay after 1.dxe5 ♕ xe5 2.♕ xe5 ♗ xe5. Unfortunately, he comes up short after an intermediary hit on his queen:
1. ♘ b7! ♕ f8 Or 1...♕ e7 2.dxe5 ♗ xe5 3.♕ b4. 2.dxe5 ♖ d3 3. ♕ b4
1-0
FCM 8.26
Atlas-Enders Ptuj 1995 Black is playing for chaos in view of his ramshackle forces, but White cuts through it with an in-between attack on the queen:
1. ♘ d5! ♗ xc1 2. ♘ xb4! ♕ b2 3. ♘ xc6 ♗ h6 4. ♘ b8! A novel forcing
move wins another pawn and ends the nonsense. 1-0
FCM 8.27
Ivanchuk-Ponomariov Shenyang 2000 Bad is 1.♖ f3 ♕ e7 2.♘ xd6 ♖ xf3 3.♘ xf3 ♕ xd6, e.g. 4.♕ xa6? ♕ xg3+, but White can force Black to recapture with the pawn on d6 by playing ♖ f3 as a zwischenzug on the second move:
1. ♘ xd6! cxd6 2. ♖ f3! ♕ e7 3. ♕ xa6 ♖ xf3 4. ♘ xf3 ♗ g4 5. ♕ d3 1-0
FCM 8.28
Muffang-Alekhine (variation) Paris 1923 In this classic example, the fantastic EST 1...f4!! induces the winning in-between queen hit 2. ♕ xf4 hxg5! (or 2...♕ d3!), 0-1 . Black also wins beautifully in the lines 2.♖ xc2 fxe3 3.♖ xc8+ ♘ xc8! with a triple attack, or 2.♕ e1 ♕ g6!, winning the knight due to the mate threat on g2.
FCM 8.29
Grigoriev-Panikovsky Kurgan 1972 Black could simply win a pawn with 1...♘ xf3+ 2.♗ xf3 fxe4 and 3... ♗ xh3, but he decides to set a little trap first:
1...fxe4!
White takes the bait with the faulty zwischenzug 2. ♘ xd4?? , assuming that Black has let him escape with 2...cxd4? 3.♘ xe4, but in fact he must resign after an in-between queen attack:
2...e3!! Winning a piece! Either capture on e3 allows the pawn fork
3...cxd4, and otherwise 3...exf2+ wins. 0-1
D) Promotion-based zwischenzugs As with other forcing moves, an advanced passed pawn increases the odds of success for an in-between move.
FCM 8.30
Gulko-Grigorian Vilnius 1971 There is of course no time for 1.♕ d5+ ♔ h7 2.♖ f8?? ♕ g1#, but CHANGING THE MOVE ORDER leads to a happier result:
1. ♖ f8+! ♖ xf8
Or 1...♔ h7 2.♕ g6#.
2. ♕ d5+! ♔ h7 3.exf8 ♘ +!
More forcing than other (losing) promotions! It allows only one (bad) option: 3... ♔ h8 4. ♘ eg6# .
FCM 8.31
Nakamura-Ding Liren St Louis 2016 Since promoting (usually) makes a new queen, the old lady can often be left hanging with advantage, in favor of the newer model:
1.dxc6! ♕ xe5
Black's desperate try to get the queens off is thwarted: 1...♕ xc1
2.cxb7! ♕ xf1+ 3.♔ xf1 and White will keep an extra piece.
Another crushing zwischenzug swings the variation 1...♗ xc6 2.♘ xb5! ♕ xc1 3.♘ c7+ ♔ d7 4.♖ axc1 around.
2.cxb7 ♖ b8 3. ♘ d5!
Thanks to the tempi generated by in-between forcing moves, the tactical genius Nakamura can play the winning attack in his sleep.
3...exd5 4. ♕ c8+ ♔ e7 5. ♖ xa6 ♘ xg3 6. ♗ xb5 ♘ e2+ 7. ♗ xe2 f6 8. ♖ e6+
♕ xe6 9. ♕ xb8 1-0
FCM 8.32
Spassky-Reshko Leningrad 1959 White's attack is not for the faint-hearted; he's down a rook and knight, a queen trade is threatened, and inadequate is 1.♕ xg4? ♗ g7!. Spassky shows why he was such a feared attacker in his prime:
1.e7!
Hanging queens can sometimes be ignored when the object is to replace them with stronger new ones!
1... ♗ xe7
Loses outright, as does 1...♕ xg3 2.e8♕ #. The best try was 1...♖ xg2+!, returning all the material, but White should win with 2.♕ xg2 ♗ g7 3.♕ xg4+ ♘ d7 4.♖ xb5 threatening 5.♘ b6+ ♔ c7 6.♘ xd7 ♕ xd7 7.♖ xb7+; on 4...♔ b8 5.♗ f4 ♗ e5 6.♕ xd7! wins.

Dückstein-Kaluanasaram New Delhi 1961 The bishop's dance is quite funny and instructive, as is the in- between check enabling promotion. 1. ♗ c2+ ♔ g8 2. ♖ f8+! ♖ xf8 3. ♗ b3+! 1-0 When a passer is bound for glory, there may be no need for niceties like pausing to recapture pieces:

Yudovich-Botvinnik (variation) Moscow 1931 White is well-prepared for 1...♖ xf1+ 2.♔ xf1 e3 3.♘ xe3, preventing mate on g2, but again by inverting the moves Black rams the passer through:
1...e3! and after 2. ♖ xf3 (2.♘ xe3 ♖ xe3! 3.♕ xe3 ♕ xg2#), not the
routine recapture 2...♗ xf3?? 3.♘ xe3 but the zwischenzug 2...e2! 0-1 . The power of a double promotion threat (on d1 or e1) should be duly noted by computer eyes. E) Unusual zwischenzugs
FCM 8.36
Sjugirov-Riazantsev St Petersburg 2017 White, in tough straits, hopes to muck it up and scrounge a draw. From an artistic standpoint it's a shame that 1...♗ c5 wins easily, because Black's zwischenzug-based solution makes a lasting impression:
1... ♘ xe4 2. ♖ xf6
2.♘ xc2 ♗ c5+. Now Black has two ways to recapture the rook but
the winning move is... neither!
2... ♗ c5! 0-1
FCM 8.37
Hertan-Fang Watertown 1996 White won a pawn with a neat in-between capture:
1.a5! ♘ xc3 2. ♕ xb7! ♖ b8 and now 3. ♘ c6! , winning, 1-0 .
Instead I forgot to examine the most forcing move first, and played the bungling 3.♕ a7?, still managing to prevail eventually.

Petursson-Van Wely Reykjavik 1994 Crisp technique is a hallmark of GM computer eyes. Against strong opposition, precise tactics in winning positions eliminate a long and uncertain technical process.
1. ♘ xe5! ♘ xe5 when after the 'normal' 2.fxe5 he can still flail with
2...♗ g5 or ...♗ a3, but the elegant zwischenzug 2. ♖ xd4!
completely blew up Black's position: 1-0 .
FCM 8.39
Fischer-Schweber Buenos Aires 1970 An unsuspecting Black thought he was taking the initiative, until Fischer uncorked an amazing zwischenzug:
1. ♖ xe4!! ♕ xg3 2. ♖ xd4!! , regaining the queen with 3.♗ f4, when
suddenly Black's proud center is reduced to dust, and White won rather easily with the strong f6 passer; 1-0 .
FCM 8.40
De Firmian-Bronstein (variation) Oviedo (rapid) 1993 The justification of this key line of Black's attack was a sensational zwischenzug:
1... ♖ xg2!! 2. ♕ xh4 ♖ xh2!! , regaining the queen with a simple win,
since 3.♕ g4? ♖ h1+ 4.♔ f2 ♖ 8h2+ 5.♕ g2 ♖ xg2+ picks off a rook. 0-1 Chapter 8 - Exercises Ex 8.1 Time for a mating attack? Ex 8.2 Who comes first?

appears OK after 2.hxg3 ♗ g7, 2.♕ xf8+ ♖ g8 or 2.♕ xf6+ ♖ g7, but Tal had planned something else: 2. ♗ g6!! An unbelievably strong in-between mate threat and, to my eyes, one of the most beautiful moves in chess history. 2... ♖ xg6 The twin h7-f8 mate threats can only be put off for one more turn. 3.fxg6 fxg6 4. ♕ xf8# Ex 8.7 L.B.Hansen-Nijboer Wijk aan Zee 1995 Black was no doubt mortified when the clever thematic idea of regaining the piece by 1.dxe6 f4 blew up in his face after the in- between queen attack 2.e7! ♕ xe7 3. ♗ b6 1-0 !

CHAPTER 9
Defensive forcing moves Study material Next we consider a form of human bias which has much to do with certain personalities and game situations. Many strong attackers, from club players all the way up to world- class GM's, are known to play much more weakly when defending a difficult position. Successful attacking play requires a certain degree of optimism, and gifted attackers feel inspired by positions that seem to hold a wealth of sacrificial ideas. Even certain positional players who try to avoid attacking situations may be overcome by 'attacker's blindness' when they 'accidentally' find themselves in an aggressive position. Perhaps they discover a beautiful checkmating idea in analysis, and suddenly it seems as if no power on heaven and earth can possibly stop their wonderful attack... However, becoming a better player involves continually striving for greater objectivity. Computers have no prejudice against finding the winning forcing move in 'defensive' positions. In fact, the beasts seem to rather enjoy accepting our 'brilliant' sacrifices, and laughing all the way to the bank with their extra material, as our initiative disintegrates to dust. A well-rounded human player must also try to relish the task of analyzing defensive forcing moves well, while under attack. This type of cool defense will win you many points. The trick of successful chess is to pose the opponent maximal problems in every situation. Players who put their utmost energy into deeply calculating inferior positions can frustrate attackers to the breaking point, forcing them to find perhaps the one fine line to victory. Furthermore, training your computer eyes to find DEFENSIVE FORCING MOVES will also make you a better attacker! This apparent paradox is really quite logical; finding strong defensive ideas in the midst of brute force calculation lets you anticipate your opponent's resources and avoid pitfalls. If you can learn to relish stout, hard-working, deeply calculated defenses in the fine tradition of chess giants like Lasker, Kortchnoi, Petrosian and Topalov, you will no doubt reap the benefit in 'stolen' wins and draws. In this chapter we will look at situations where the attack proves to be just a mirage, and apparently grim positions in which the defender shows that (s)he too has access to brilliant forcing moves.
FCM 9.1
Tringov-Fischer Havana 1965 Before this game, 1...♕ xe5? was theory, with an inferior ending after 2.♕ xe5. But Fischer demonstrates his computer eyes in the defense:
1... ♘ c6! 2. ♕ f7 The first point is 2.♗ xd7 ♗ xd7 3.♖ xb7 ♗ c5+
4.♔ h1 ♕ xc3 with a winning back rank threat.
2... ♕ c5+ 3. ♔ h1 ♘ f6! The second point, and a beauty. 4.exf6 ♗ xe6
and the attack is a mirage - the ♗ g5 falls and Black is just winning.
4. ♗ xc8 ♘ xe5! 5. ♕ e6 ♘ eg4! 0-1 . The ♗ c8 hangs, and mate greets
6.♗ xb7 ♘ f2+ 7.♔ g1 ♘ h3+! 8.♔ h1 ♕ g1#.
Poor Tringov! Ambushed in the theoretical jungle. In this chapter we'll look at two types of defensive forcing moves: A) Forcing defensive 'stoppers' : the defender disarms the attacker's threats and wins. A special case is given here as A2: stalemate combinations, where the attack is repelled by a combination that culminates in stalemating the defender, resulting in a draw. B) Counterattacking defensive forcing moves : the defender repels threats and becomes the attacker. A1) Forcing defensive 'stoppers' These are powerful defensive forcing moves that refute the enemy attack and win.
FCM 9.2
Liss-Smirin Tel Aviv 1999 White has played the stock diversion shot 1.♖ h8, playing for mate after 1...♕ xh8? 2.♕ xg6+ ♔ f8 3.♗ h6+. Black's deft DEFENSIVE STOPPER shows that the attack was based on a hallucination:
1...gxf5! 2. ♕ g7+
After 2.♖ xg8 ♖ xg8, Black regains the pinned queen and wins.
2... ♕ xg7+ 3.fxg7 ♗ d7! 0-1
FCM 9.3
Ahues-NN Berlin 1954 White has 'caught' his amateur opponent in the simple stock combination 1...gxf6 2.♖ g3+ ♔ h8 3.♗ xf6#: Black must also capitulate on 1...♕ e1+? 2.♔ h2!. But wait...
1... ♕ g4!! 0-1 Now White is the one who must resign after 2.hxg4 gxf6
or 2.♖ g3 ♕ xg3!.
FCM 9.4
C.Hansen-Sadvakasov Skanderborg 2003 Computer eyes use accurate brute force calculation to determine when the attack is a mirage. Most players would be quite scared of Black's a-pawn, especially since after 1.♕ a5? ♕ xd3 2.♕ xa4 ♖ b1! 3.♕ d7 the win is difficult. But White sees a still more cold- blooded winning method:
1. ♕ d7! a3
If 1...♖ b4 2.♖ a8+ ♔ h7 3.♕ f5+ g6 4.♕ h3+ ♖ h4 5.gxh4 ♕ d5+
6.♕ f3.
2. ♕ d6! a2
More tenacious was 2...♖ b4, but now 3.♕ d8+ ♔ h7 4.♕ a5 works because the rook is attacked: 4...a2 5.♕ xa2 ♕ xd3 6.♕ xf7.
3. ♖ xa2! with a won ending; 1-0 .
FCM 9.5
Alekhine-Verlinsky Odessa 1918 Black's resistance was based on the back rank threat 1.♖ xc7?? ♖ f1#, but White found a defensive shot which killed all counterplay at once:
1. ♕ d1!! ♕ a5 2. ♕ xe2 ♕ xe5 3. ♖ d5 1-0
FCM 9.6
Akobian-Taboas Radriguez Gibraltar 2019 A key aspect of good technique is avoiding unnecessary complications. Black wants to play 1...♘ xc2 and 2...♗ xc3, when the a-pawn is secure. The computer shows that 1.h5 also wins tactically, but White's idea is more astute. He lets Black make a huge counterthreat on b2, then wins outright with a surprise defensive stopper:
1. ♗ xa4 ♗ xa4 2. ♕ xa4 ♘ e2 3. ♘ xe2 ♖ xe2 4. ♖ g2! , stopping the
threat cold (due to the hanging ♖ e8) and winning cleanly, 1-0 .
FCM 9.7
Kolitzki-Har Zvi Israel (rapid) 1998 Naturally, large sacrifices require great precision; otherwise computer eyes will strip away the 'emperor's new clothes' and leave the attacker naked. White's mating idea 1...♕ xf3?? 2.♖ b5+ dissolved to dust with a stout forcing defensive stopper:
1... ♖ f6! 2. ♕ c5 ♕ xf3 3. ♕ b5+ ♖ b6 0-1
FCM 9.8
Bisguier-Tal Reykjavik 1971 White has let himself fall into Black's 'trap' ...♖ c7, apparently winning a piece, because he can turn the tables with a surprise defensive blow:
1. ♗ g8+!! ♔ xg8 2. ♕ d5+
And now Black should have played for the better side of a probable draw with 2...♖ f7! 3.♖ e7! (3.♕ xd3? ♖ xf3!) 3...♕ f4 4.♕ xf7+! (bad is 4.♖ xf7? ♕ xg4+ 5.♔ h1 ♗ e4!) 4...♕ xf7 5.♖ xf7 ♔ xf7
6.♘ e5+ ♔ e6 7.♘ xd3 g5! (7...♔ d5!? 8.♘ f4+ ♔ c4 9.♘ xg6 ♔
b3 10.f4 ♔ xa3 11.f5!), since he remained worse after 2... ♔ h7 3. ♕ xd3 1-0 .
FCM 9.9
Golod-Berkovich Rishon-le-Zion 2002 Black seems likely to win his bet that the imposing passer on c2 is worth more than a rook, but White's strong forcing defensive play defuses the bomb:
1. ♘ d6+! ♔ d7 2. ♘ xc4 ♘ xc1 2...♗ xc1 3.♗ xd3. 3. ♘ xb2 ♘ b3 4. ♘
d3 ♖ d2 5. ♘ c1 ♖ d1? Time pressure seems to be the culprit, as White would still have tough work ahead on 5...♘ d4 6.♗ d3!; or 5...♘ c5 6.♖ f4!, winning after 6...♖ d1 7.♖ c4!.
6. ♖ f7+ 1-0
FCM 9.10
Onescus-Gama Romania 1956 Black suffered a case of 'attacker's blindness', seeing only mate until the giant defensive meteorite 1. ♘ xf3! exf3 2. ♕ g7+!! (kaboom!) came crashing down. After 2...♔ xg7 or 2...♖ xg7 3.♖ e8+ ♖ g8 4.♖ xg8+, the pawn on g3 is freed from the pin and decides the game. 1-0
FCM 9.11
Wohl-Karatorossian Ubeda 2000 Black endures a few scary moments before the attack runs out of fuel. Can your computer eyes distinguish a futile attack from the real thing? Tenacity, and precise brute force calculation, are the keys!
1... ♕ d8! 2. ♗ h7+!
Otherwise Black trades queens or safely captures the bishop.
2... ♔ xh7 3. ♘ g5+ ♔ g8 4. ♕ h6 ♗ d3 5. ♖ e3 ♕ b6!
In military terms, 'conditions on the ground' have changed, and the black queen must reoccupy this forward post to defend and counterattack.
6.h4! ♕ xd4!
Black must relish the defensive task! He is planning to sac his queen on 7.♘ xe6 fxe6 8.♖ g3+ ♕ g4 with advantage. Less clear was 6... ♘ xd4 7.♔ h2! ♗ g6 8.♘ h7! ♕ d8! (not 8...♗ xh7? 9.♖ g3+ ♗ g6
10.♖ xg6+ with a draw) 9.♘ f6+ ♕ xf6 10.exf6 ♘ f5, but his best
move was 6...♕ b1+! 7.♔ h2 ♗ g6.
7. ♖ g3 ♗ g6 0-1
It may not look pretty, but Black walks away on 8.♘ xf7 ♔ xf7, and holds cleanly on 8.♘ xe6 ♕ a1+ 9.♔ h2 ♕ xe5, pinning the rook.
FCM 9.12
Short-Wang Zili Beijing 2000 There is a marked aesthetic difference between a 'brilliant' defense and a 'stodgy' defense, but computer eyes don't play favorites as long as the goal is reached. Hence the marauding black rook is laid to waste by two 'ugly' defensive shots:
1. ♖ a1! ♗ b5 2. ♗ c1! 1-0
FCM 9.13
Cappallo-Fang Massachusetts 1998 Black's motto was 'steady as she goes' in this hairy encounter. He could easily have lost his nerve and let White off with 1...♕ g6? 2.♕ b7 ♕ xe4 3.♕ xb6+ ♔ e7 4.♕ b7+ =, or 1...♖ f8? 2.♘ g5! ♖ c6
3.♕ b7, or even 3.♖ f1!?=. A better try is 1...♖ c1+! 2.♖ xc1 ♕
xc1+ 3.♔ f2 ♕ xb2+ 4.♔ g1 ♕ c1+ 5.♔ f2 ♕ c2+ 6.♔ g1 ♕ d1+
7.♔ f2 ♕ g4!.
Instead comes a strong and precise 'sturdy' defensive shot:
1... ♖ g7! 2. ♕ f6+
The king escapes to safety on 2.♕ f8+ ♔ c7 3.♕ d6+ ♔ b7.
2... ♕ xf6 3.exf6 ♖ gc7! 4. ♘ g5 ♖ c1+ 5. ♖ xc1 ♖ xc1+ 6. ♔ f2 ♔ e8 0-1
FCM 9.14
Feher-Priehoda Hungary tt 1994/95 By contrast, a brilliant defensive ploy was the only ticket here to refute Black's clever mating idea 1.♖ xd8?? ♘ b3#. Unintimidated computer eyes found the monster forcing move 1. ♗ c4!! and Black resigned; there is no more mate if Black captures the bishop, and on queen moves follows 2.♗ xa2. 1-0
FCM 9.15
Maur de Fosses (city) -Essen (city) telephone match 1986 Black looks like he's facing a tough defense. On 1...♕ xg3, 2.♖ xc6+ is very hazardous, even though the king may stroll to relative safety. But a marvelous defensive forcing move turns the tables:
1... ♕ c7!! 2. ♖ xc6
White draws a blank on 2.♗ xc7 ♗ xa8, while on 2.♕ any, the unpinned ♘ b8 enables 2...♕ xg3.
2... ♕ xc6 3. ♕ xb8+ ♔ d7 4. ♕ a7+ ♔ e6 5.g6!
The position is still unclear, but Black has escaped trouble and has at least a draw in hand with 5...♖ e7 6.♕ e3+ ♔ d7 7.♕ a7+ etc.
FCM 9.16
Maiorov-Zakharevich Moscow 1999 White's attack looks very nice, but Black simply sees deeper and correctly evaluates his strong play in the ensuing ending:
1...g5! 2. ♕ h5 ♘ xf6 3. ♕ xh6+ ♘ h7 4.e5 ♕ h4 5. ♖ f6 ♖ ad8 6. ♕ xh4
Forced; if 6.♗ xh7 ♕ xh6 7.♖ xh6 ♔ g7 8.♖ h5 ♖ h8.
6...gxh4 7. ♖ h6 ♖ xd3! 8.cxd3 h3!
A very strong thrust.
9. ♔ g1
9.gxh3? ♖ g8! and 10...♗ d5+.
9... ♖ d8 10. ♖ d1 ♖ d4! 11.g3
11.gxh3 ♔ g7 12.♖ h5 ♔ g6 traps the rook!
11... ♖ d5 12.d4 c5 13. ♖ h4 ♔ g7 14. ♔ f2 ♘ g5 15. ♖ f4 cxd4 16. ♖ fxd4 ♖
xe5 and Black cashed in on his material and positional pluses; 0-1 . A2) Stalemate combinations We take a brief look at these unusual forcing defensive moves, in which the defender defuses the attack by utilizing the stalemate rule to achieve a draw. Unwary human eyes have a notorious tendency to 'forget' this important rule, since we humans don't see it very often in practice.
FCM 9.17
Bannik-Vistanetskis Soviet Union 1961 To make progress here, the king must hide from checks with 1... ♖ g2+ 2. ♔ f6 , but Black had prepared the forcing defensive sacrifice 2... a1 ♕ +! 3. ♖ xa1 ♖ a2 with a 'perpetual attack' on the white rook (4.♖ b1 ♖ b2!) because 4. ♖ xa2 is stalemate: 1⁄2-1⁄2 .
FCM 9.18
Korn-Pitschak Brno 1936 Black must have been quite pleased with his combinative last move ...dxe2, preparing the promotion idea 1.♕ xd4? exf1♕ + or stock mate on 1.♕ xe2 ♕ h4+. But joy quickly turned to horror after the improbable drawing combination 1. ♖ f8+! ♔ xf8 2. ♕ f5+ ♔ e7 3. ♕ f7+ ♔ d8 4. ♕ f8+ ♘ e8 5. ♕ e7+! ♔ xe7 stalemate. And certainly not 5...♔ c8 6.♕ b7+ ♔ d8 7.e7#! B) Counterattacking defensive forcing moves When you are playing Magnus, the line between a 'routine defensive move' and a winning shot may become blurred!
FCM 9.19
Carlsen-Vallejo Pons Sao Paolo 2011

Black would even be better if not for this resource, but the champ had foreseen that it not only neutralizes Black's play, but creates the unstoppable forking threat 3.b4!.

Krasenkow-Nakamura Barcelona 2007 With his last move 1.♘ c6 White tries to launch an attack with threats on the b-file and e7. Black could respond with 1...♕ c5, but decides that the best defense is to launch a devastating counterattack with 1... ♖ xc6!! 2. ♗ xf6 ♕ xf2+!! when brute force analysis shows a forced win:

Ehlvest-Short Riga 1995 Like most great 'classical' players, the Englishman Nigel Short is an exceptionally deep and dogged defender. Most mortals would quake in their boots defending such a position, with White's pieces raking the naked king, but Black stoutly demonstrates the stronger trumps:

Now 2.♘ xf8+ or 2.♘ g5+ are hammered by 2...♗ d5!, while on 2.♘ xg7+ d5! wins the knight in view of the threat of 3...♖ xg2+ and mate. The best reply is 2.♘ f4+!, covering g2, but Black is attacking after 2...d5.
2. ♖ xf6 ♖ xg2+ 3. ♔ f1

Gershman-Gusev Soviet Union 1968 It's far from clear who is really attacking here, but the answer comes in a problem-like defensive interference move which also creates winning counterthreats:
1... ♖ xf3!! 2.d8 ♕ ♕ f2+ 3. ♔ h1 ♖ b3!!
This bombshell is the most direct and elegant decision, while 3...♖ f8 or 3...♖ f7 should also do the trick. But only drawing is 3...♗ xe4

He had foreseen the simple 1... ♖ a7! , when in fact Black takes over the initiative with ...♖ ag7. In case of 2.♕ e3, 2...♕ d8! still leaves Black on top, e.g. 3.d4 ♖ ag7 4.d5? ♗ a7, or 3.♘ d2 ♖ ag7 4.♘ f3 ♕ d6!, threatening 5...♖ g2, e.g. 6.♖ f2? ♗ a7! 7.d4 ♗ xd4!. 0-1

CHAPTER 10
Endgame forcing moves Study material Your computer eyes have now taken a long journey through the land of human bias. They have learned to avoid 'knee-jerk defensive responses' and the 'staleness' of looking only at 'normal' moves; to be aware of forcing defensive resources; and to consider quiet moves and retreats when attacking. Now I must ask you to confront one more popular misconception: the idea that endgames are boring and technical . I can already see many of you club players starting to yawn. But if you pick up my favorite endgame book Pandolfini's Endgame Course by Bruce Pandolfini, I promise that you will see beautiful forcing moves bursting out of every page! Perhaps the public bias against enjoying the endgame comes from good old human laziness; it is true that learning some theory will help your endgame skill a great deal. But if you make the effort to digest one good ending book, you may yet become an endgame lover and will certainly become a better player! GM Yasser Seirawan wrote: 'Good technique is good tactics!' Here's what he meant: while theory is important, the most crucial endgame skill is still analyzing forcing moves well . The endgame is actually a great laboratory for developing your computer eyes, because its greater simplicity allows for more precise calculation of brute force variations. In the following game I was able to make the deepest calculation of my career, with the help of some theoretical knowledge:
FCM 10.1
Epp-Hertan Watertown 1991 Despite the good extra pawn, the outcome is in doubt due to the strong position of White's men. Thus the direct 1...♔ f6 2.♔ h4 g5+?
3.♔ h5 achieves nothing; nor does running the other way with 1...♔
d6? 2.♔ g5 ♔ c5 3.♔ xg6 ♔ c4?? 4.♔ f6 ♔ d4 5.♔ f5 and White even wins via the stock 'Trebuchet' position. I quickly realized that my king must be brought to h6, and that this could be achieved with the use of 'corresponding squares' (i.e., when his king occupies g5, I must be ready to respond with ...♔ g7! to repel him and make progress). So, the solution begins with 1... ♔ f7 2. ♔ h4 ♔ g8! . After 2...♔ g7?
3.♔ g5 I would be forced to repeat the position with 3...♔ f7 4.♔ h4.
3. ♔ g4 ♔ h7! Only via this square can I force my way to h6.
4. ♔ g5 ♔ g7 5. ♔ h4!
Life is simple after 5.♔ g4 ♔ h6 6.♔ h4 g5+ 7.♔ g4 ♔ g6, penetrating.
5... ♔ h6 6. ♔ g4 g5 The only way to make progress.
position after 6...g5 So I got my king to h6, but the question remains: can I win?
7. ♔ f5!
Passive defense is hopeless: 7.♔ h3 ♔ h5 8.♔ g3 g4 9.♔ g2 ♔ h4 and Black advances to g3 and walks his king over to win the e-pawn. But now theory is no help; everything rests on brute force analysis!
7... ♔ h5 8. ♔ xe5 g4
position after 8...g4 The critical position. White can't enter a simple race because I queen first and stop his pawn on the 7th rank. Thus he must try to slow down my advance, and there are two ways to do it. They are both quite interesting, and fortunately they both fall just short, for different reasons.
9. ♔ f4
The less obvious try was 9.♔ d4 g3 10.♔ e3 (not 10.e5 g2) 10...♔ g4! 11.e5 ♔ h3 12.e6 g2, queening with check also after 13.♔ f2 ♔ h2.
9... ♔ h4 10.e5 g3 11.e6
Now both sides queen, but I have a winning forcing move at the end. No help is 11.♔ f3 ♔ h3 12.e6 g2 13.♔ f2 ♔ h2 14.e7 g1♕ +.
11...g2 12.e7 g1 ♕ 13.e8 ♕ ♕ f2+ 0-1 because 14...♕ e2+ wins the
queen. In this chapter, we examine three types of beautiful endgame forcing moves: A) Endgame mating themes Which are far more common in endings than you may think. It is important to keep in mind that 'endgames' comprise a very broad spectrum of positions, from simplified king endings to tense tactical battles with major (and perhaps a few minor) pieces, when king safety continues to play a huge role. These can be subdivided a little further into: A1) Direct mating themes , in which the object is to deliver checkmate; A2) Technical mating themes , in which some technical problem (often, how to deal with the opponent's promotion threats) is solved by the use of mating ideas; A3) Indirect mating themes , in which a forcing mate threat results in decisive material gain. B) Material-winning endgame forcing moves C) Endgame promotion tactics Here is another great reason why, to develop computer eyes, you need to study endgames! Forcing moves involving pawn promotion are much more common and important at this stage of the game. In fact, a huge number of theoretical and practical endgames, like the one above, are decided by the question of whether the attacker can promote an extra pawn. The result of a promotion tactic is not always keeping the new queen, but often sacrificing it in return for mate or win of material. A) Endgame mating themes A1) Direct mating themes In these positions, the threat of checkmate is used as an end in itself (mate is forced) rather than as a means toward some other goal (material gain, promotion, etc.).
FCM 10.2
Oratovsky-Miladinovic Salou 2000 The quiet forcing move 1... ♗ a4! leads to sudden mate:
2. ♖ f3
Or 2.♕ xa4 ♕ d2#.
2... ♕ c1+ 3. ♗ d1 ♕ xd1#
Another mating combination with a quiet touch is this classic gem:
FCM 10.3

FCM 10.4
Krasenkow-Svidler Polanica Zdroj 2000 Even with just a few pieces left, the opposite-colored bishops here help the attacker win on the light squares:
1.c7! ♕ xc7 2. ♕ e1+! A winning forcing retreat.
2... ♔ g5
2...♔ h5 3.♕ e6 meets the same fate.
3.h4+ ♔ h5 4. ♕ e6! and mate on g4; 1-0 .
FCM 10.5
Goglidze-Kasparian Soviet Union 1934 White's tactical idea of g4-g5+ and ♖ h7# is evidently refuted by:
1.g4 ♖ h3+ 2. ♔ f4 ♖ h4!
But White has seen deeper and spotted an elegant sacrifice:
3. ♖ xf5! gxf5 4. ♔ xf5 , when 5.g5+ and mate on h7 still prevails,
despite the minimalist material; 1-0 .
FCM 10.6
A.Ivanov-Grigorov Soviet Union 1987 Both kings lack shelter, but White moves first!
1. ♖ h4+ ♔ xh4
1...gxh4 2.♕ g6#.
2. ♕ h7+ ♕ h5
Or 2...♔ g4 3.♕ h3#.
3.fxg3+ ♔ g4 4. ♕ d7+ ♖ f5 5. ♕ d1+ ♖ f3 6. ♕ xf3#
A beautiful queen tour. Penetrating computer eyes were aided by the small number of side variations typical of simplified endings. In such positions, the task of selection becomes a bit easier, and raw calculation and board sight come to the forefront.
FCM 10.7
Bondarevsky-Ufimtsev Leningrad 1936 Black's computer eyes were ill-advisedly closed and he woke up stunned and embarrassed by:
1. ♖ h8+! ♔ f7
Black must have expected resignation here since the mating idea
2.♔ g5 is easily refuted by 2...♘ xe4+.
2. ♗ e8+!! ♘ xe8 3. ♔ g5! mating on f8 after all. 1-0 A fanciful
conception!
FCM 10.8
Emelin-Zaitsev St Petersburg 1999 Here, too, it seems that Black failed to sense the danger:
1. ♗ e7+ ♔ f5
Or 1...♔ h6 2.♖ xh5+ ♔ g7 3.♗ f6+.
2. ♗ f6!! This quiet forcing move leads to mate after 2... ♖ h7 3. ♖
xh5+! ♖ xh5 4.g4# . There was even a second mate: 2.♖ xh5+! ♖ xh5
3.g4+ ♔ xe5 4.♘ d3#.
FCM 10.9
Ree-Jansa Krakow 1964 Black has clearly won the opening battle and carried an initiative into the ending. Now he finishes the job in fine style with an unusual corridor mate:
1... ♖ c5! 2. ♖ f1
Black's brilliant threat can't be stopped due to 2.♕ xc5 ♕ xg3# or
2.♕ g2 ♕ h5#.
2... ♘ e3!! A fantastic EST! There is no defense to 3...♖ h5#. 0-1
A2) Technical mating ideas Here mating threats are used to resolve a technical problem, such as the opponent's promotion threats.
FCM 10.10
Nakamura-Grischuk St Louis 2015 Here's a stellar example of accurate analysis in the service of technique. Black is almost in zugzwang, but White's win is impeded by the limited material and the passed a-pawn. White finds time to capture two pawns, stop the a-pawn and finish with a mating net. It's irrelevant that the engine protests that 'anything wins' - the important thing is to calculate a foolproof winning method .
1. ♗ f4! a5 2. ♗ xh6! a4 3. ♗ e3 a3 4. ♗ xc5 a2 5. ♗ d4 ♘ c7 6. ♗ a1 ♘ e8
These moves were fairly easy to calculate, Now White needs to overcome the knight shuffle e8-c7, and the solution is a mating net:
7.c5 ♘ c7 8.c6 ♘ e8 9. ♔ h4 ♘ c7 10. ♔ h5 ♘ e8 11.c7! 1-0 11...♘ c7
12.♖ f7+ and mate in 4.
FCM 10.11
Hertan-Rohde Vermont 1993 Here, a mating net was the final phase of the breaking down of Black's fortress:
1. ♗ f8!
Not 1.♗ e7?? ♘ c7+.
1...e4
Justified desperation, in view of the coming 2.♖ g7+ and 3.♔ f7. Here I prolonged things with 2.fxe4?!, but best was the direct approach 2. ♖ g7+ ♔ h8 3. ♔ f7 ♘ f4 (forced, to stop 4.♖ g6) 4. ♖ g8+ ♔ h7 5. ♗ g7! (threatening 6.♖ h8#) 5... ♘ g6 6. ♗ xf6 ♗ xf6 7. ♖ xg6! 1- 0 .
FCM 10.12
Korobov-Karjakin Kramatorsk 2001 Black's counterplay is far too serious in the event of 1.cxb4 ♖ xb4
2.♖ a7+ ♔ d8 3.♖ xh7 ♖ xd4, so White devises a most elegant
forcing solution:
1. ♗ a6!! b3!
On 1...♖ b8 White sacrifices the bishop and wins with 2.♖ xb8 ♔ xb8 3.cxb4! ♗ xa6 4.g5!? ♗ c8 5.♔ g7 ♗ d7 6.♔ xh7 ♗ e8 7.♔ g7 ♔ c7 8.♔ f6 ♔ d7 9.h4.
2. ♗ xb7! b2 3. ♗ xc8! b1 ♕ 4. ♔ e7! fxg4
Too late is 4...♕ e1 5.♗ a6 ♕ h4+ 6.g5.
5. ♗ a6 1-0 Black must give up his new queen to stop the threat 6.♖
c8#.
FCM 10.13
Stahlberg-Gligoric Saltsjöbaden izt 1952 Black's last hope is to capture White's remaining pawns, using his passers as a decoy, but White accurately calculates the most forceful winning idea, using mate threats:
1. ♖ g5! b3 2. ♔ f7! ♖ xe6 2...♔ h6 3.♘ f4 and 4.♖ xh5#. 3. ♔ xe6 b2 4.
♔ f7! ♔ h6 5. ♖ g8! One more mate threat dooms the pawns.
5... ♔ h7 6. ♖ b8 1-0
FCM 10.14
Fressinet-Vallin Vichy 2000 White is winning with his active pieces and connected passed pawns, but computer eyes found a precise mating sequence to end Black's resistance quickly:
1. ♖ b7! ♘ a6
Horrid is 1...h3 2.♖ xb8+ ♔ e7 3.♖ xh8 h2 4.♖ xh7+.
2.e6
The trio of rook, knight and advanced pawn are a formidable attacking force.
2...h3 3. ♖ d7+ ♔ e8 4. ♘ c8! h2 5. ♘ d6+ ♔ f8 6.e7+ 1-0
On 6...♔ g7 the important stock stratagem of promoting with discovered check, 7.e8♕ +, punches Black's ticket. A3) Indirect mating themes A mate threat is used as a device to gain decisive material.
FCM 10.15
Krishna-Rapport Douglas 2018 White's passers could easily take over, but instead the impact of Black's h3-pawn makes itself felt deep into the ending. In the study of master games, it's almost shocking how often an enduring craw pawn finally proves decisive...
1... ♖ xf4! 2.gxf4 ♕ xd5
The simple mate threat is a disaster for White; he must ditch the c- pawn to avoid the forking ...♕ d4+. But then the pawn-down major piece ending is decided by Black's far superior king shelter.
3. ♕ b2 ♕ xc6 4. ♖ c1 ♕ e4 5. ♕ f2 ♖ b8 0-1
FCM 10.16
Sasikiran-Sutovsky Pune 2004 At first glance the white d-pawn seems dominant, but the crucial role of king safety in major piece endings must never be underestimated, and Black is in fact winning:
1... ♖ e5! 2. ♕ xe5
White can dance but he can't hide. If 2.♕ d2 e3!, or 2.d7 ♖ xd5 3.♖ c8+ ♔ g7 4.♖ xd5 e3!.
2... ♕ xd1+ 3. ♔ g2 ♕ f3+ 4. ♔ g1 e3! The mate threat wins a whole
rook; 5.♖ c2 ♕ d1+ or 5.♖ c1 exf2+ 6.♔ f1 ♕ h1+ etc., 0-1 . White's exposure to checks and mating threats cost him the game.
FCM 10.17
Ivanovic-Popovic Yugoslavia 1973 The marvelous quiet forcing move 1. ♗ e6! wins a piece, problem- style, as every black defense leads to a different mating move: 1... d5 2.♕ e5+; 1...♗ b7 2.♕ d4+; or 1... ♕ xe6 2. ♕ f8+ ♕ g8 3. ♕ f6+ 1-0 .
FCM 10.18
Neumann-Kolisch Paris 1867 Long before computers, computer eyes used penetrating brute force calculation to unlock the mysteries of such positions.
1... ♕ h2+! 2. ♔ d1
Not 2.♔ e3 ♗ f2+; or 2.♔ f1 ♗ xf5! with mate in five.
2... ♗ xe1!
This beautifully-calculated concept wins a piece, since recaptures allow mate: 3.♗ xe1 ♕ c2#, or 3.♔ xe1 ♕ h1+ 4.♔ f2 ♕ f3+ 5.♔ e1 (5.♔ g1 ♕ g2#) 5...♗ d3 6.♕ f2 (6.♕ e3 ♕ f1#) 6...♕ h1+. 0-1
FCM 10.19
Karpov-Timman (variation) Kuala Lumpur 1990 In My Best Games Karpov trots out a stunning variation which allows White to break through:
1.g7!! ♘ e7 2. ♗ xe8!! a2
2...♘ g8+ 3.♔ f7 ♘ h6+ 4.♔ f8 changes nothing.
3. ♘ xa2 e2 4. ♘ c3! , miraculously winning both passed pawns in view
of 4...e1 ♕ 5. ♘ b5# . B) Material-winning ending forcing moves
FCM 10.20
Ye Jiangchuan-Bacrot Batumi (rapid) 2001 White is relying on the trick 1...♖ xd5+?? 2.♔ e4 ♘ f6+ 3.♖ xf6+!, but his ship sinks hard after the accurate forcing moves 1...e6+! 2. ♔ e4 ♘ f6+ 3. ♔ f3 ♔ g7! , trapping the rook. 0-1
FCM 10.21
Kashdan-Kotov USA-Soviet Union radio match 1946 White's opening initiative has carried into a sharp ending, and he now capitalizes on Black's back rank problem with 1. ♘ e7+! ♕ xe7 2. ♕ xc8+ ♕ f8 3. ♗ h7+ 1-0 .
FCM 10.22
Nielsen-Rogozenco Germany Bundesliga 2003/04 One reason endings are so instructive is that they showcase various tactics, and properties of the pieces, in their simplest form. Here is a textbook illustration of the CROSS-PIN in action:
1. ♕ c8+ ♔ g7
Or 1...♖ e8 2.♕ d7.
2. ♕ e8!
The rook is pinned both ways and thereby paralyzed.
2... ♔ f6 3. ♕ f8+ 1-0
In the next examples, the knight's forking power is on display.
FCM 10.23
Grischuk-Timman Wijk aan Zee 2002 Black is perhaps just a tempo short of holding, but White's forcing play shows that entering the ending was the correct way to prosecute the attack:
1.g6+!
A dagger thrust that cripples all hopes of consolidation.
1... ♗ xg6
Hopeless is 1...♔ f8, entombing the rook, e.g. 2.♘ e6+ ♗ xe6 3.♖ xe6 c5 4.♖ xa6!.
2. ♖ e7+!
The point! A stock fork trick converts the initiative into material gain.
2... ♔ xe7 3. ♘ xg6+ ♔ e6 4. ♘ xh8 1-0 The knight gets out via f7 or g6.
FCM 10.24
Verlinsky-Levenfish Leningrad 1933 White's counterplay certainly seems adequate, but a fork trick forces winning simplifications. Instead of the drawing 1...♕ d1+?, Black could have played 1... ♕ g2+ 2. ♔ h4 ♕ h2+ 3. ♔ g4 . Better, but not good enough, is 3.♘ h3 ♕ g3+! 4.♔ xg3 ♘ e4+ 5.♔ g4 ♘ xf6+ 6.♔ g5 ♔ g7, when 7.♘ f2 d5! 8.f5 ♘ e4+ or 7.f5 ♘ e4+
8.♔ f4 ♘ c3 win. 3... ♕ h5+ 4. ♔ g3 ♕ xg5+! 5. ♕ xg5 ♘ e4+ 0-1
With queens off, the exposed king is not a factor and Black converts his extra pawn.
FCM 10.25
Degraeve-Barsov Montreal 2002 Here is one more homage to the knight's prowess, which is undeniable from such a dominant outpost:
1. ♕ e8+ ♖ b8
1...♕ b8 allows 2.♖ xa7+! ♔ xa7 3.♕ a4+ ♖ a6 4.♕ xa6#.
2. ♘ a6! ♖ xe8
He declines to prolong the agony with 2...♕ c8 3.♕ xf7.
3. ♘ xc7+ 1-0
FCM 10.26
I.Gurevich-Hertan Watertown 1989 The rook's capacity to wreak havoc on the seventh rank is the basis of many an endgame forcing move. White relied upon the strategic push f2-f3 to relieve the pressure on f2 and undermine Black's center, but he was ambushed by a creeper:
1... ♘ h4! 2. ♖ ad1
2.fxe4 ♖ f2 with ...♖ xg2+ and ...♖ 8f2 coming is much too strong,
but now Black wins a decisive pawn cleanly.
2... ♖ g6! 3.g4
Or 3.♖ e2 exf3.
3... ♖ xf3! 0-1
FCM 10.27
Uhlmann-Zapata Thessaloniki 1988 Black's defense of the weak center pawns is based on a cute tactic, but White's computer eyes see through it to force victory:
1. ♖ d7! ♖ d3
1...♗ a3 allows the forcing line 2.g4! ♖ d3 3.♖ g7+ ♔ h6 4.g5+ ♔
h5 5.♖ xh7+ ♔ g4 6.♗ e3 and the pawns are too strong.
2. ♖ xd6 ♗ e3+!
The pinned ♗ d4 is the point of Black's play, but White counters with a little fork trick by the rook:
3. ♔ e2! ♖ xd4 4. ♖ xe6+ and 5.♖ xe3 wins easily. 1-0
FCM 10.28
Acevedo-Fischer Siegen 1970 Black breaks through with a decisive surprise forcing move, after which his positional dominance induces immediate resignation:
1... ♘ xc3! 2. ♔ xc3
Hopeless is 2.♖ xa2+ ♘ xa2 3.b5 ♘ b4+ 4.♔ c3 ♘ d3.
2... ♖ a1! 3. ♖ d2
If 3.♔ c2 ♖ xd1! also wins.
3... ♖ c1+ 0-1 After 4.♖ c2, 4...♗ xb4 mates.
FCM 10.29
Kunte-Kasimdzhanov Pune 2004 White's queening threat seems invincible, but Black has peered further:
1... ♕ e4+! 2. ♔ f2
White's exposed king can't escape harm's way: 2.♔ h2 ♕ xd4! 3.♕ xc2 ♕ xd7; 2.♔ h3 ♕ h1+; 2.♔ g1 ♖ xd2 3.♖ xd2 ♕ xe3+, and
2.♔ f1 ♖ xd2 3.♖ xd2 ♕ f3+ 4.♔ e1 ♕ xe3+ 5.♔ d1 ♕ xd2+ 6.♔
xd2 ♔ e7 all lose.
2... ♕ xd4! 3. ♕ xc2 ♕ xd7 0-1
FCM 10.30
Olson-Charbonneau North Bay 1998 The monster surprise blow 1... ♖ g4+! wins a piece after 2. ♔ xg4 exd5+ check. 0-1 A key issue in the ending (and middlegame) is choosing the right time to convert a positional edge into a material one, without allowing too much counterplay.
FCM 10.31
Andersson-Browne Lucerne 1982 Black pounced on White's bunched-up forces:
1... ♖ a8! 2. ♔ b2
The e-pawn falls on 2.♘ e2 ♖ a2+ 3.♔ d1 ♘ f1!.
2... ♘ f1! 3. ♘ e2
The clever point is that after 3.♖ e2 Black jumps back on the g-file with 3...♖ g8, winning White's knight.
3... ♘ xe3 4. ♖ g1 d5!
Exchanging a weak pawn and preparing a strong knight maneuver.
5.cxd5 ♘ xd5 6. ♖ d1 ♘ b4 0-1 . The positional threat 7...♘ d3+, along
with the tactical idea 7...♖ a2+, decides. C) Endgame Promotion Tactics These endgame forcing moves may result in actual promotion, or in forced mate or win of material via the threat of promotion.
FCM 10.32
Battes-Hertan Albany 1997 Computer eyes demonstrate that Black queens by one tempo after removing all counterplay with 1... ♔ xh4! 2. ♖ xe5 b5 3. ♔ g6 ♔ g4 4. ♔ f6 ♔ f4 5. ♖ e1 (5.♔ e6 ♖ e7+!) 5...b4 6. ♔ e6 b3 7. ♔ d5 b2! 8. ♖ b1 ♔ e3! 9. ♔ c4 ♔ d2! 0-1 .
FCM 10.33
Burns-Mannion-Peralta Gibraltar 2019 As if the threat to queen weren't enough, 7th rank passers control key 8th rank squares, allowing other pieces, particularly the rook+queen, to occupy outposts deep in enemy territory. When the defender has a back-rank liability as here, the end is often near:
1... ♗ xa1 2. ♖ xa1 ♖ cd8! 0-1 The incursion 3...♖ d1 will cost a rook.
FCM 10.34
Ding Liren-Grischuk Shamkir 2019 Queen and pawn endings are great laboratories for probing the depths of brute force calculation. Reduced forces give the ladies lots of room to roam, so computer eyes come to the fore. White found an incredible surprise forcing move here, proving his passers outweigh the insidious knight:
1.d6! ♘ f2+ 2. ♔ h4 ♕ d4+ 3. ♔ h5 ♕ d1+ 4.g4!! Pure geometry of the
highest order. Black had a miracle draw after 4.♔ g6 ♕ d3+ 5.♔ h6 ♘ g4+ 6.♔ h5 ♕ f5!! Position after 6...♕ f5
7.d7 ♘ f6+! 8.♔ h6 (8.♕ xf6?? ♕ h3+ 9.♔ g6 ♕ h7#) 8...♘ g4+=,
but now after 4...♕ xg4+ 5.♔ g6! Black is helpless.
4... ♘ xg4 5. ♕ e8+ ♔ g7 6. ♕ d7+ 1-0
FCM 10.35
Bayram-Mastrovasilis Antalya 2004 There are endless incarnations of the sacrifice that enables the advanced passed pawn's coronation:
1...c2!
Not the hasty 1...♖ xe4?? 2.♖ xe4 ♖ xe4 3.♖ xe4 c2 4.♖ e8+.
2. ♔ f3 ♖ xe4! 3. ♖ xe4 ♖ xe4 4. ♔ xe4 ♗ g5 and the endgame was
winning; 0-1 .
FCM 10.36
Reshevsky-Byrne (variation) Sousse 1967 The achievement of two far-advanced connected passers usually decides the contest (unless they can be effectively blockaded), so major sacrifices are often justified to achieve such a 'dynamic duo':
1. ♗ a6!
On 1...bxa6 2.c6 Black will get just one pawn for his rook.
1... ♖ b8 2. ♖ xf6! 1-0 The pawns roll after 2...♖ xf6 3.♗ xb7!.
Why is the rook considered 'the drawing piece'? Because it is so adept at creating counterchances, both checking the king at a distance and stopping passed pawns from behind.
FCM 10.37
Martens-Grabczewski Gothenburg 1968 Thus, here it would be a rookie mistake to let Black keep slugging with 1.♖ b7!? ♔ h5! 2.♖ xb4? ♖ g8! 3.♖ b7 ♖ g5+ 4.♔ f4 (4.♔ e4 ♔ g6) 4...♖ g4+. Instead, a swift tactic exploits the stock endgame idea that a rook can't stop connected pawns on the 6th:
1. ♖ xf7! ♖ xf7 2.e6 ♖ xf6+
Otherwise 3.e7 is decisive.
3. ♔ xf6 b3 4.e7 b2 5.e8 ♕ b1 ♕
A common theme: both sides queen, but one retains a winning initiative.
6. ♕ e3+! ♔ h7
6...♔ h5 7.♕ g5#.
7. ♕ e7+ 1-0 Mate in two.
FCM 10.38
Short-Stefansson Reykjavik 2002 Two advanced disconnected passers often overwhelm enemy defenses as well:
1.e6! ♖ e5
Black prefers to go down fighting, since on 1...♖ c7 2.♗ d5 (or even
2.c3) he is virtually in zugzwang and must lose the vital f7-pawn to
break the pin on the f-file, while White is free to waltz his king in.
2. ♗ d5! ♖ xd5 3.e7 ♖ e5 4. ♖ xg6+!!
All along, White's sights were set on bigger game than the exchange.
4...hxg6 5.h7+! ♔ g7 6.exf8 ♕ + 1-0
FCM 10.39
Taylor-Edouard Gibraltar 2019 Black has a large positional edge, but in such positions there is no 'safe solution'. A sacrifice is necessary to break White's blockade, so Black must calculate enough forcing variations to make sure the breakthrough is decisive:
1... ♖ h2 2. ♖ g1 ♘ g6 3. ♔ f1 ♘ h4 4. ♘ b6
4.♘ d6 held out longer, but White wants the practical hope of taking
the a-pawn. The sacrifice comes anyway after 4.♘ d2 ♗ e7!, forcing the white knight away.
4... ♘ xf3!
To win, Black must now prove that his advanced pawns and active pieces outweigh the knight.
5.gxf3 ♖ f2+ 6. ♔ e1 ♗ h4!
The forcing threat 7...g2 with 8...♖ f1+ fuels Black's success.
7. ♔ d1 ♖ xf3 8. ♘ c4
If 8.♘ xa4 the most thematic win is 8...♖ d3+ 9.♔ e2 f3+, making a queen.
8... ♖ f2 9. ♗ e1
Despite the extra piece, White is comically tied in knots.
9... ♖ a2 10. ♔ c1 ♖ e2 11. ♘ d2 ♖ e3 12. ♔ b2 ♗ e7 0-1
FCM 10.40
Movsesian-Bacrot Sarajevo 2000 Here Black exploits two important promotion motifs to score a goal: interference with the rook's control of the first rank, and the knight's notorious weakness at stopping far advanced rook pawns:
1...a3! 2.b5!
White plays his last trump, since otherwise 2...♖ b1 means a certain death.
2... ♖ xb5! 3. ♔ xd3 ♖ b1! 0-1 Pawn promotion carries the day on 4.♘
xb1 c1♕ or 4.♖ xb1 cxb1♕ + 5.♘ xb1 a2 6.♔ c2 a1♕ .
FCM 10.41
Szabo-Dozsa Budapest 1962 Another key weapon in the promotion arsenal is the combination exchanging the only piece that can stop the passer:
1. ♘ e6+! fxe6
Black's only grim hope was 1...♔ h7 2.♖ c7 ♖ e8! 3.♖ xf7+ ♔ g8
4.♖ g7+ ♔ h8 5.♖ xg6 ♘ xe4, but White would put paid to that with
2.d6!, forcing his pawn through.
2. ♖ c7+ ♔ g8 3. ♖ c8+ ♔ g7 4. ♖ xh8 ♔ xh8 5.d6 1-0
FCM 10.42
Hakki-Harikrishna Abu Dhabi 2004 Black has finely calculated a much surer road to victory than 1...♖ xb3?; a beautiful quiet forcing move which again demonstrates the theme of interference with the rook's defense of the 1st rank:
1...c5!! 2. ♘ xa3
Otherwise Black obtains deadly connected passers, since b3 can't be defended: 2.♗ c4? ♗ xc4 3.bxc4 ♘ d1+.
2...bxa3 3. ♖ c2 a2 4. ♖ c1 ♘ b1! 0-1
FCM 10.43
Pirc-Byrne Helsinki ol 1952 Your computer eyes should need little prompting to find a 100% forcing four-move combination, in which each move allows only one plausible reply:
1... ♘ f5+ 2. ♔ d3 ♖ xc3+! 3. ♔ xc3 ♘ e3! 4. ♖ xf2 ♘ d1+ 0-1
FCM 10.44
Topalov-Bareev Wijk aan Zee 2004 In rook endings especially, material considerations may take a back seat to other factors like placement of king and rook, and the ability to support or stop passed pawns. So White is justified in fighting on via the g-file pin, and would even achieve equality after 1...f2? 2.♔ xg2!. Only the INCISIVE FORCING RETREAT 1... ♔ f8! seals White's fate by leaving the black rooks well placed to support the passers after 2.♖ f1 ♖ b2!, 2.♖ a1 ♖ b2! (threatening 3...♖ b1+) 3.♖ 4xa2 ♖ xa2
4.♖ xa2 f2, or in the main line 2. ♖ xg2 f2! 3. ♖ xf2 (3.♖ g1 f1♕ !) 3...
♖ xf2 4. ♔ g1 ♖ b2 followed by ...♖ b1+ and ...a1♕ . 0-1
FCM 10.45
Miller-Omholt Jensen correspondence game, 1984 Many endings evolve into pitched battles around the fate of one passed pawn. White's mighty efforts to contain the d-pawn were shattered by a tactic:
1... ♕ xf1+! 2. ♕ xf1 ♗ f2! , when 3...♖ xf1+ and 4...♗ e1 forces a
new queen. 0-1 In the remaining examples, promotion ideas are combined with mating threats:
FCM 10.46
Schlechter-Perlis (modified) Carlsbad 1911 On 1.♔ e6 or 1.♔ c6, Black can and must check from behind. Hence the beautiful solution 1.e5! , promoting or mating after both 1... fxe5 2.♔ e6 ♖ c2 3.♖ a8+ ♖ c8 4.♖ xc8+ ♔ xc8 5.♔ e7, and 1... ♖ xe5+ 2. ♔ c6 ♔ e8 3. ♖ a8+ ♔ f7 4.d7 1-0
FCM 10.47
Spangenberg-Soppe Buenos Aires 1998 White springs a surprise mating net in this wild ending with an EST:
1.e6! fxe6
On 1...♖ xf4, 2.e7 queens and mates!
2. ♖ xe6 ♖ h8
Forced, as after 2...♗ f6 3.♖ e8+ ♗ d8 4.♗ f5 mates.
3. ♖ xc6! ♗ d4 4. ♖ xc7+ ♔ b8 5.cxd5!
There is no immediate knockout blow, but the computer eyes of the GM navigate the road to victory:
5... ♖ xf2+ 6. ♔ g3 ♖ xf4
Falling on his sword, but 7.♘ d7+ and 8.♗ b5 with the threat of 9.♗ c6 were already irresistible.
7. ♘ a6+! A crushing zwischenzug. 1-0

CHAPTER 11
Intuition and creativity In the study of master games, it is not unusual to come across comments such as this one, from Nezhmetdinov's Best Games of Chess :
FCM 11.1
Polugaevsky-Nezhmetdinov Sochi 1958 After the stunning EST 1... ♖ xf4!! Rashid Nezhmetdinov candidly confesses: 'It goes without saying that it was impossible to calculate all the likely continuations over the board. The combination was intuitive and that is why it was difficult to decide on.' But a terrific decision it turned out to be, both practically and artistically. Black won beautifully: 2. ♖ xh2 2.gxf4 ♗ xf4+ 3.♘ xf4 (3.♔ d4 ♕ f2+
4.♔ c3 ♕ c5#) 3...♘ xc2+. 2... ♖ f3+ 3. ♔ d4 ♗ g7 Nezhmetdinov
originally intended 3...c5+, but found in time that White escapes with
4.dxc6 bxc6 5.♗ d3! ♘ exd3 (better may be 5...♗ g7! 6.♔ c3 ♘
exd3+ 7.♔ d2 ♗ xb2) 6.♖ xh6 ♘ xb2 7.♖ xd6 ♘ xd1 8.♖ xd1.
4.a4? To prevent the quiet 4...b5!. Rashid devotes long analysis to
4.♘ c3! ♖ xg3! (also quite interesting is 4...c5+ 5.dxc6 ♘ ed3+ or
the direct 4...♘ ed3+! 5.e5 ♗ xe5+ 6.♔ c4 (6.♔ e4 ♘ c5#) 6...♘ xb2+ 7.♔ xb4 ♗ xc3+ 8.♔ a3 ♘ xd1 9.♖ xd1 ♖ xg3) and concludes that Black is still better. 4...c5+ 5.dxc6 bxc6 6. ♗ d3 ♘ exd3+ 7. ♔ c4 d5+ 8.exd5 cxd5+ 9. ♔ b5 ♖ b8+ 10. ♔ a5 ♘ c6+ 0-1 11.♔ a6 ♖ b6#. All true chess lovers appreciate the great human achievement of executing such a beautiful combination at the highest level. The machinations of cold machines cannot undo these triumphs of human sweat and imagination, under the grueling conditions of sports competition. But where does 'master intuition' come from ? What are the factors that go into creating such sublime works of art? A concise answer would have to include the following factors:
1. A strong knowledge of stock combinations and other forcing
chess moves.
2. Hard work , to calculate enough variations to assess the
likelihood of success, and not overlook any obvious refutations.
3. Creativity . The urge to create something beautiful, and push
beyond one's usual limits in search of hidden possibilities, is a driving force for great conceptions. Computer eyes, helping us overcome human bias, are very helpful here.
4. Courage ! As Nezhmetdinov mused, intuitive combinations are
not easy to play! Chess players are quite prone to the human tendency of wanting to feel in complete control over the board. But intuitive combinations require a carefully considered 'leap into the unknown'!
5. Master experience and practical wisdom . Masters have the
precious benefit of having faced a wide array of situations many times before. This helps them weigh the many subtle factors that go into deciding whether an intuitive combination is worth the risk, such as: 'Is there a simpler continuation that has better chances to succeed?', 'How have similar positions played out for me in the past?', 'Do I think this opponent is likely to be able to navigate the chaos as well as I am? Is (s-)he uncomfortable defending?', 'What is the likely best and worst case scenario? Is the risk of this continuation worth the potential gain?', 'How does time pressure factor in to the decision?', and 'Does experience tell me that this intuitive line best meets the demands of the position?'. Every great master will tell you that sometimes a 'little birdie' inside the head tells him or her that an intuitive combination 'must be right'. This is the voice of judgment and experience. But rarely will he act too quickly on that voice; he must first try to ensure that the forcing variations support the intuition. To begin developing your own 'master intuition', you will have to start by strengthening your knowledge of forcing moves, sharpening your computer eyes to look beyond stereotyped solutions, working hard on analysis, and having the courage to try for something great. You may fail many times and fall flat on your face in the short run; but learning to take calculated risks will make you a much more creative, interesting and dangerous player over time. Early in my chess career, I played a remarkable game against the venerable American master, Dr. Ariel Mengarini. The score sheet vanished long ago, but the outcome left an indelible impression on my mind. I had the opportunity to sacrifice my queen for only a knight, in beautiful fashion, to weave a mating net. Some inner instinct must have gripped me, because although I couldn't find the mate, I sat there looking at the position for an hour, wanting desperately to play the sacrifice. Finally, in my inexperience, I played another move and soon lost, having given away too much time and inspiration. Afterwards, my young master friend Steve Feinberg jumped forward to show what I had missed: a fantastic quiet forcing move soon after sacrificing the queen, which would have led to a quick mate. Such experiences are not soon forgotten, and the lessons I learned about creativity, intuition and courage came in handy when I finally got a second chance:
FCM 11.2
Hertan-Curdo Amherst 1988
1. ♘ xg6!!
Like Nezhmetdinov, I admit that I couldn't see all the variations in advance. But unlike in my earlier game with Mengarini, master intuition guided me. After discovering the pivotal EST on move 3, I realized that if the combination worked, it could be the creative achievement of a lifetime. I worked hard to calculate the forcing moves as best I could, and then the 'little birdie' of instinct told me to take the leap...
1... ♘ xg6 2.gxf5 ♗ xf5 3. ♖ xg6!
Key point #1: Curtains for Black is 3...♗ xd3 4.♖ xh6#; or 3...♗ xg6
4.♕ xg6+ ♔ h8 5.♗ xh6! with mate in 7. I was certain that Curdo, a
rugged defender of the old school, would find the only move:
3... ♗ g5!
... after which I had planned a queen sacrifice:
4. ♗ xg5! ♗ xd3
The queen must be taken, since a mate-threatening EST extricates the rook after 4...hxg5 5.♖ 6xg5!.
5. ♗ xd3 hxg5
Hopeless are 5...♖ f5 6.♗ f6 with mate in 7, or 5...♔ h8 6.♖ xh6+ ♔ g7 7.♖ h7+ ♔ f8 8.♖ h8+ ♔ g7 9.♗ f6#.
6. ♖ 6xg5+!
A critical moment; I first planned 6.♖ 1xg5??, but 'one last look' revealed the miracle defense 6...♕ xh3+!! 7.♔ xh3 ♖ xf3+ 8.♖ g3 ♖ xd3 with only a much better ending! Luckily, I was in a hyper-alert creative state, determined not to waste the promise of the sacrifice:
6... ♔ h6
On 6...♔ h8, 7.♖ h5+ wins.
7. ♖ g6+ ♔ h5
position after 7...♔ h5 Now if 8.♖ 1g5+ ♔ h4 with counterthreats, but...
8.f4!!
Imagine my delight on discovering this awesome quiet forcing move, threatening both 8.♗ e2+ and 8.♖ 1g5+!. This I had not foreseen, but fortune often favors the brave!
8... ♖ e6 9. ♗ e2+ ♔ h4 10. ♖ 1g4+ ♔ h5 11. ♖ 4g5+ 1-0
Inspiration and the attack Attacking play is the ultimate proving ground for combining the spark of creativity and the intuition of experience, with the backbone of strong calculation of forcing moves. Attempting to take the enemy fortress by storm usually carries some risk, since it involves taking committal measures, rather than just sitting solidly on one's assets. Unless the attack is already overwhelming, it goes without saying that the defender will have his own trumps, and that his sense of danger and awareness will be heightened. Therefore, great attackers are players who seem to always come up with some creative spark, often a calculated risk, which transforms the position away from usual channels, and forces the defender to navigate treacherous waters. Good attackers have a well-developed sense of intuition, which helps them assess the level of risk involved in an intuitive sacrifice, and the likelihood of success, but above all, they are superior calculators and adventurous souls, who revel in analyzing creative forcing moves and finding hidden surprises. Another trait which separates the best attackers is fearlessness; they are not afraid of sometimes losing a game by pushing the envelope too far, if it means winning many more games by virtue of their prowess and courage. While it is usually not possible to calculate every variation of a complex attack, the intuition and experience of the attacker helps him hone in on the most critical lines which must be accurately foreseen in order to justify the risk. Attacking wizards have usually prepared several nasty analytical surprises for their unwary prey, before they start the offensive...
FCM 11.3
Nunn-A.Sokolov Dubai 1986 Black is underdeveloped, and his king position is suspect. The conditions are ripe for an attack, so White's inspiration starts flowing:
1.e5!
Nunn writes: 'Black is forced to take with the pawn, but this immediately improves white's position in 3 ways:... the d file and the diagonal f3-a8 are opened... the ♗ f6 is hemmed in... and the e4- square is freed for the ♘ c3. Of course these are only general points, indicating that 1.e5 is worth taking seriously; it is still necessary to calculate that the move actually works.' In other words, insight and intuition are important factors, but one must calculate the forcing moves first before embarking on such a sacrifice.
1...dxe5 2. ♘ e4!
The first surprise; the knight is activated with tempo via the forcing fork threat 3.♘ d6+.
2... ♕ c7
Not 2...♕ d5 3.c4!.
3. ♕ g3! ♘ e7 4. ♖ ad1!
Nunn notes that when the opponent has structural weaknesses which are difficult to mend, it is often correct to bring up the reserves, rather than taking more drastic measures. I agree in theory, but in this case the rook move is also correct because it prevents Black's only hope of consolidation, ...♗ d7 and ...O-O-O. That said, the computer gives the immediate 4.♖ xf6! gxf6 5.♘ xf6+! as winning.
4...h4
4...♗ d7 runs into the precise sequence 5.♖ xf6! gxf6 6.♘ xf6+ ♔
f7 (not 6...♔ d8 7.♘ xe6+) 7.♘ f3! (a fine forcing retreat) 7...♔ xf6
8.♗ g5+ ♔ f7 9.♘ xe5+ ♔ e8 10.♗ xe7 ♔ xe7 11.♕ g7+.
5. ♘ xf6+ gxf6 6. ♕ g7 ♖ f8
On 6...♖ g8 7.♕ xf6 ♘ d5 comes the beautiful EST 8.♘ xe6!!, winning.
7. ♖ xf6!
White's crisply calculated forcing moves give the defender no rest.
7... ♖ xf6 8. ♕ xf6 ♕ d6
Or the impressive brute force line 8...exd4 9.♕ h8+ ♔ d7 10.♖ xd4+ ♘ d5 (10...♔ c6 11.♕ e8+!) 11.♕ g7+ ♔ e8 (11...♔ d6 12.♗ f4+)12.♕ g8+ ♔ e7 13.♖ xd5! exd5 14.♕ g7+ and the black queen is lost to a bishop check! position after 8...♕ d6
9. ♗ g5! exd4 10. ♖ xd4 ♘ d5 11. ♖ xd5!
Winning the queen or mating; 1-0 . It was not necessary, nor possible to calculate every line in advance. The risk was relatively small (one pawn), and the positional benefits were fairly clear. All Nunn really needed was the intuition to trust the sacrifice, the creativity to set Black new problems, and the effort to correctly calculate critical variations as the attack unfolded. Every chess player has been occasionally baffled and irritated by the annotation 'White has a winning attack'. We may respond with some mixture of berating the author ('Is he too lazy to show me the variations?'), getting angry at ourselves ('Why can't I see it?'), or even disbelief - sometimes with good reason! Still, there are some sacrifices which are so powerful that a master needs only to calculate a few key variations, to trust his intuition that a forced win exists.
FCM 11.4
Blackburne-Von Bardeleben Hastings 1895 England's first great attacker, the 'Black Death' Henry Blackburne, foresees the power of the advance g3-g4-g5 together with an attack on the h-file, and quickly calculates a few key forcing moves, after which intuition takes over.
1. ♖ xd5! cxd5
The first point is 1...♘ xd5 2.e4!.
2.g4! ♕ e6
The second key is 2...♕ g6 3.♘ f4, winning. On 2...♕ d7 follows
3.♗ xf6 gxf6 4.♖ h1 or 4.♘ f4 'with a winning attack!'.
3. ♘ f4 ♕ d6 4. ♖ h1 ♖ fd8
Black's last chance was 4...d4! after which things are still not so clear: 5.♘ d5 h6! or 5.exd4 ♕ xf4 6.dxc5 h6! and White is only slightly better in both lines, whereas he's even a little worse after
5.g5? dxc3 6.gxf6 h6!.
5.g5 d4 5...♘ e8 6.♕ xh7+ ♔ f8 7.♘ xd5. 6.gxf6 h6 7.exd4 ♗ xd4 8. ♘ d5
1-0 In other cases there is too much risk involved to leave any forcing moves to chance, and the attacker must try to calculate everything to the end. In these situations, creativity and hard work come to the forefront, and the role of intuition is only to guide the master to the possibility that a beautiful combination may exist:
FCM 11.5
Rossolimo-Reissmann San Juan 1967
1. ♗ xd5! cxd5 2. ♘ f6+ ♔ h8 3. ♕ g6!!
position after 3.♕ g6!! The French-American master Nicholas Rossolimo was an incredibly creative attacker, but knowledge of stock mating attacks helped guide this astounding idea.
3... ♕ c2!
Thankfully for posterity, Black plays the best defense. On 3...fxg6
4.♘ xg6+ hxg6 5.♖ h3 mates; or 3...gxf6 4.♕ xf6+ ♘ g7 5.♖ g3 ♖
g8 6.♘ xf7+ mops up.
4. ♖ h3!!
The fitting finale is a stunning quiet forcing move. Everything hangs, but stock mate on h7 is unavoidable.
4... ♕ xg6
4...h6 5.♖ xh6+; another nice line is 4...♘ g5 5.♘ xf7+! ♖ xf7 6.♕
xc2.
5. ♘ xg6+ fxg6 6. ♖ xh7#
FCM 11.6
Khalifman-Ermenkov Elenite 1994 White didn't enter this position to acquiesce to a draw after 1.♕ a6 ♖ a8, but rather to translate his positional plus into a direct attack with a creative solution:
1.b4!!
It is probable that White analyzed a few critical lines in depth and, after refuting Black's main tries, trusted intuitively that the passed pawns must promote. Very telling is the fact that Black has not a shred of counterplay, so White need only determine that the march of the pawns cannot be derailed:
1... ♖ xc6 2.dxc6 e6
A typical line is 2...cxb4 3.b6 ♕ e8 4.c7 ♕ b5 5.c4! ♕ xc4 6.♖ ec1 ♕ a6 (or 6...♕ xe4 7.c8♕ ♖ xc8 8.♖ xc8+ ♔ f7 9.♖ b2 and the b- pawn is golden) 7.♖ xb4 ♕ b7 8.♖ a4, easily busting the blockade; also rather pathetic is 2...♕ b6 3.c4! ♖ a8 4.♖ a1 ♖ xa1 5.♖ xa1 e6 6.♖ a6 (6.♖ a8+! ♔ f7 7.bxc5 dxc5 8.♗ d2!+- is another nice computer line) 6...♕ c7 7.bxc5 dxc5 8.♗ xc5.
3. ♖ ed1 ♕ b8 4.bxc5 d5 5.exd5 exd5 6. ♖ xd5 ♕ e8 7.c7 ♕ f7 8.b6! ♕ xd5 9.b7
1-0 Intuition and creativity in the service of wresting the initiative In most games a moment arises in which it becomes clear that one side is dictating the play. Sometimes this occurs right out of the opening, but in many games, or even several times within a game, a battle takes place over who can establish the initiative. The player with the initiative is better able to influence the play with forcing moves, and this is important psychologically, because it puts pressure on the opponent; but also strategically, because it enables the attacker to play to his strength , i.e., the sector of the board in which he holds an edge. Holding the initiative doesn't assure a win, or even an advantage. Some initiatives prove superficial, and a master may be willing and able to withstand some temporary activity, in order to tempt the opponent to overreach, or to show that his trumps (material, structure, pawn breaks, or stronger long-term threats, to name a few) are better in the end. Still, strong players recognize that all things being equal, holding the initiative is often decisive. Experienced masters have a good intuitive feel for which moments in the game have the potential to be KEY TURNING POINTS , and this awareness allows them to apply maximal creative energy and brute force calculation to the goal of finding the right forcing moves, or the continuation likely to set the opponent the most difficult problems.
FCM 11.7
Larsen-Tal Eersel 1969 Only White could claim winning chances after 1...♕ xa8 2.♘ f2!? ♗ xf1 3.♕ c8+!, so Black's bid for the initiative with 1... ♘ xe4! was not only inspiration, but strategic necessity!
2.fxe4 ♕ g5+ 3. ♔ f2
Now Black could force a draw by repetition with 3...♕ h4+, but in typical Tal fashion he rolled the dice with
3... ♕ g2+?!
... trusting his ability to swim in murky waters. His attacker's instincts paid off as White went wrong with:
4. ♔ e1 ♘ h4 5. ♗ e3?
White appears to consolidate and win with 5.♘ f2! ♘ f3+ 6.♔ d1 ♘ d4 (or 6...♘ xh2 7.♘ xh3 ♘ xf1 8.♕ c8+) 7.♕ c3. But how strongly can we condemn Tal's decision to go for broke, when it succeeded against one of the strongest players of his era? Against a computer such play might be suicidal, but in human play, the pressure to find perhaps one saving line in an impenetrable jungle of alternatives, with threats looming at every turn, is tremendous. We cannot know what other factors, such as time pressure or tournament position, may have influenced this bold decision.
5... ♕ xe4! 6. ♗ f2 f3!
position after 6...f3 Black is still down a rook and piece for the moment, but his inspired play has certainly enabled him to wrest the initiative! Most attackers would relish Black's position; his position is much easier to play, since he has already committed himself to finding only the strongest attacking move, while White faces sudden death with one false move at every juncture.
7. ♗ xh4 ♕ xh4+ 8. ♘ f2 fxe2 9. ♕ xe2 e4! 10. ♖ g1 e3 11. ♕ xe3 ♖ e7 12. ♖
xg7+ ♔ xg7 13. ♖ c7 ♗ d7 14. ♖ xd7 ♖ xd7 15. ♕ xa7 ♖ e7+ 16. ♔ d1?
16.♔ f1 was forced, but Black's position was preferable, and White
was exhausted from arduous defense, and likely in time trouble.
16... ♕ c4 0-1 17...♕ f1+ and 18...♖ e2+ decides.
A great struggle between two inventive giants!
FCM 11.8
Shirov-Eingorn Stockholm 1989 With White's king parading up the open central file in a complicated middlegame, and his kingside underdeveloped, it's hard to say who is attacking. Indeed, White judged that Black's counter-threats would assure a draw after 1.♘ g5 ♘ c6! 2.♕ xh7+ ♔ f8 3.♕ h8+ ♔ e7
4.♘ d5+ (4.♕ xg7? ♗ f5+) 4...♔ d7 5.♕ h3+ ♔ e8 6.♕ h8+. Only
an attacking genius like Shirov would brave such a shocking ploy to wrest the initiative as:
1.e6!! fxe6?
One reason that boldness is often rewarded is that few players have the stomach to wade into a sea of treacherous long variations. Often the defender will try to steer the boat into calmer channels, at the precise moment when the position calls for vigorous counter- measures. The central idea of 1.e6!! was to eliminate the nasty threat of 1...♗ f5+ by capturing the bishop with tempo after 1...♗ xe6 2.♘ g5. In Fire on Board , Shirov states that Black could then equalize with 2... ♕ xa3 3.♕ xh7+ ♔ f8 4.♕ h8+ ♔ e7 5.♘ xe6 ♕ a6+ 6.♔ c2 ♕ xe6
7.♗ b5! ♕ g6+ 8.♔ b3 ♕ e6+ 9.♗ c4 (9.♔ b2! ♗ d4 10.♕ e8+ ♔
d6 11.♖ d1 looks good) 9...♕ b6+ 10.♘ b5 ♕ a5 11.♕ h4+ ♔ f8
12.♕ h8+. But instead of taking a draw with 12.♕ h8+, I believe that
White wins with the incredible quiet forcing move 12.♖ e1!!. position after 12.♖ e1 (analysis)
12...♕ b4+ (or 12...♔ g8 13.♖ e8+ ♗ f8 14.♕ e7) 13.♔ c2 ♕ xc4+

The loss of the 'off-sides' ♖ a8 proved a great investment for Black! His creativity served a very fine purpose: transforming the whole nature of the battle, by allowing him to play to his strength on the kingside. In double-edged positions, it is something of a positional imperative to keep the initiative.

Karpov-Gik Moscow 1968 White's position would quickly crumble if Black had just a few tempi to fuel his queenside play (e.g., ...a7-a5-a4). Such situations require great accuracy and energy:

Necessity, psychology, and other practical aspects of creative forcing moves Creative forcing moves often arise from a master's intuition that the position simply demands them. When a strong player 'feels in his bones' that a particular sacrifice must be correct, he may work hard to justify intuition with analysis, or in some cases trust more to instinct, when either the move must be tried in any case, or the position does not lend itself well to deep analysis, as in this example from my practice:
FCM 11.11
Ilyin-Hertan Biel 1996 White has been horribly outplayed in the opening, and I fully expected him to submit to 1.O-O (of course the ♗ b4 is held by the fork trick ...♘ c2+) 1...♗ xc3 2.bxc3 ♘ xf3+ 3.♔ g2 ♘ h4+ and ... O-O with a winning endgame for Black. But desperate situations call for desperate measures, and White essayed a bizarre, yet inspired idea:
1. ♔ d1!
After recovering from the initial urge to laugh, I had to applaud White's ingenuity. As a practical matter, it is better to defend even a dubious position with obscure counterchances, than to defend a dry, technically lost position. My bishop is now attacked and the white rook is ready to give a check on the e-file. If 1...♗ xc3 2.bxc3 ♘ xf3
3.♗ a3! with annoying counterplay.
I could backtrack with 1...♗ e7 2.♖ e1 ♘ e6 3.♕ c6+ ♔ f8, but somehow this didn't seem in the spirit of the position. I started to feel some annoyance; wouldn't I feel embarrassed if White managed to survive? Finally, I came up with a 'crazy' idea of my own which just begged to be played:
1...O-O!
There was not much to analyze; I just looked a few moves ahead to confirm that I could impede White's development. Master intuition told me that the sacrifice must be good; how could it be wrong to take the initiative against that ridiculous king on d1? Once I 'took the plunge', the hard part was over and all the pressure was on White! My only job from then on was to keep attacking and setting him problems. After 2. ♕ xb4 ♕ f6 3.f4 ♘ c6 4. ♕ a4 ♖ ab8 5.a3 ♖ fd8 Black had full compensation and won in the middlegame.
FCM 11.12
Short-Speelman London 1988 Not only is Black faced with a strong attack and the possible interment of his bishop after g4-g5 and f5-f6; but he is also in time pressure. The 'accidental' inspiration he found was really the only practical chance:
1... ♘ xg4! 2.f6
In Jon Speelman's Best Games , Black gives this candid commentary: 'I... was off-stage when the realization hit me that he could win a piece. At first I was shocked and wondered why he was taking so long to see it, but by the time he made his move I'd realized that it would be quite playable for me. Had I had the misfortune to foresee 2.f6... then I would have wasted quite a while... looking for alternatives, and probably ended up playing 1... ♘ xg4 anyway; but with much less time...'(!) Jon had spent the little time he could afford to examine White's attempts to checkmate the black king with 2.♗ xg7 ♔ xg7 3.♕ xg4 ♖ xc3 4.f6+ (Speelman gives 4.fxe6 ♖ c7 (4...♖ xd3!), or 4.♕ h3 exf5 5.exf5 ♖ c5 as OK for Black; 6.d4 ♕ c2 7.♖ g1 ♖ d5 looks awkward, but mate is still averted after 8.f6+ ♔ h8 9.♕ h6 ♖ g8, meeting 10.♖ h3 with 10... ♕ e4+ - and Black interposes on h5 against the stock try 10.♕ xh7+?? ♔ xh7 11.♖ h3+) 4...♔ h8 5.♕ g5 (if 5.♖ h3 ♖ xd3 6.♖ xh7+ ♔ xh7 7.♕ h4+ ♔ g8 8.♕ h6 ♖ d1+ 9.♖ xd1 ♕ f3+; or 5.♕ h3 ♖ c5) 5...♖ xd3 6.♕ h6 ♖ g8.

position after 5...a3 As in the previous game, following Black's creative (and lucky!) intuitive leap, the psychology of the position has completely shifted! Black is still somewhat worse, but his position has now become much easier to play than White's, with two solid pawns for the piece, a much safer king, active pieces, and good prospects of liquidating into a drawn ending. Whereas Black was under the gun in the first diagram, the onus is now on White to make use of his extra piece. In addition, White was in a 'must-win' position in the match. After 6. ♕ d1 ♕ xb4 7. ♖ f2 (7.♕ a4 ♕ b6! 8.♕ xa3 (8.bxa3 ♕ d8!
9.♕ d4 e5) 8...♖ a8 9.♘ a4 ♕ d4) 7...axb2 8. ♘ a2 ♕ d4 9. ♖ fxb2 d5 ,
Black had good drawing chances and even went on to win when White overextended. Speelman's intuition served him well in this tense game, guiding him to find the best practical chance in a difficult situation. Creative forcing moves play a special role in completely lost positions. Once a master determines that 'correct' play gives no hope of saving the game, the only practical course is to try to trick the opponent tactically by any possible means. One of my most humiliating chess moments occurred in such a situation.
FCM 11.13
T.Pähtz-Hertan Vienna 1996 Down two good pawns with no positional trumps or concrete threats, White's situation is pretty bleak. After the capture 1... ♘ xb4 I half expected him to resign, since 2.♕ xb4 ♕ xf4 3.♕ xd4 ♕ xe4+! 4.♕ xe4 ♗ c6 is curtains. But he kept battling:
2. ♕ g2! ♕ f8 3.axb4 ♖ c2 4. ♕ f3 ♖ xb2
I could have chosen the simple 4...♗ e2 5.♕ f2 ♗ d3 6.♕ xd4 ♗ xe4+ 7.♕ xe4 ♕ f5, e.g. 8.♕ a8+ ♔ h7 9.b5 ♕ d5+. position after 4...♖ xb2
5. ♖ g6!
Objectively losing, yet the move deserves praise for giving White one last slim hope...
5... ♖ e2 6. ♕ h5
The only realistic hope in such positions is to get the opponent into severe time trouble, when even experienced masters may sometimes play beginner's moves! Whereas in the diagram position I had five minutes left against my opponent's one, I made the bad practical choice of allowing my clock to run all the way down with several moves remaining until the time control. Here 6...♕ xf4!, threatening 7...♕ h2#, wins easily, but I had a crazy hallucination: 7.♖ xg7+? ♖ xg7 8.♕ e8+?? ♕ f8?? (I 'forgot' that my bishop could simply capture the queen!) 9.♖ xg7+ ♔ xg7 10.♕ g6+. So alas, I uncorked a monstrous blunder:
6... ♖ xe4?? 7. ♖ xh6! Forcing checkmate! 1-0 .
Eyewitness Bill Paschall commented that he had never seen anyone 'steal the game' in such a manner! Chess is a very stern, but fair teacher! It was my turn to relearn the important lesson, that in winning positions one must always be vigilant for surprise forcing moves and continue to work hard calculating variations . On the other side, remember that miracles can happen when you earn the luck by continuing to use computer eyes, fight, and set every practical obstacle to the very end! In these situations, by all means be creative! Finding some crazy surprise is your only fighting chance. As we noted earlier, there are many situations (not just 'hopeless' ones!) in which the logic of the position calls for taking an intuitive leap into unclear complications:
FCM 11.14
Rauzer-Botvinnik Leningrad 1933 Given Botvinnik's penchant for deep analysis of complex positions, he probably examined many forcing lines before playing 1...d5! . Still, the move meets the demands of the position so perfectly, that there was undoubtedly an element of faith in this choice - after calculating the key lines several moves deep and liking what he saw, Black trusted that he would find his way in the ensuing complications.
2.exd5
Weaker are 2.fxe5 and 2.bxc4 in view of 2...dxe4.

The key EST justifying Black's idea.
3.bxc4
Or 3.♘ xe4 ♘ xd5! 4.bxc4 ♘ xe3 5.♕ xe3 ♗ d4.
3...exf3 4.c5! ♕ a5!
Black has a strong initiative in return for the pawn. His pieces have come to life, and White's center is under pressure.
5. ♖ ed1?
This runs into a neat refutation. Best was 5.♕ d3! b6! breaking up White's center with strong play.

FCM 11.15
Brzozka-Bronstein Miskolc 1963 Black was faced with a different kind of necessity in this position; how to avoid conceding a draw to a lesser-rated player? After 1...♘ xd5+ 2.♖ xd5, the position is completely blocked. The task looks impossible, but not for one of the most creative players of all time:
1... ♖ a6!! 2. ♖ d1
The only move, since 2.♖ e2? allows 2...♘ xd5+ 3.cxd5 c4! 4.♔ xc4 ♖ a5!, breaking the blockade and winning easily. But what is the point of Black's obscure first move?
2... ♘ xd5+ 3. ♖ xd5 ♖ xb3+!!
This is it! 4.axb3 loses to 4...a2, but now White's pawns fall right and left. Of course, Black could not calculate every line out to the end. But he could easily deduce that the rook sacrifice was his only chance to play for a win, and probably analyzed out to move nine, when master intuition and endgame knowledge could show that the mobile mass of passed center pawns, with an active king and rook, must prevail.
4. ♔ xb3 ♖ b6+ 5. ♔ c2 ♖ b2+ 6. ♔ c1 ♖ e2 7. ♖ d1 ♖ xe3 8. ♖ g1 ♖ c3+
9. ♔ d2 ♖ xc4 10. ♗ c2 d5 11. ♖ b1 d4 12. ♗ d1 ♖ c3 13. ♖ b3 e3+ 14. ♔ e2

While forcing moves are always vital to assessing the soundness of a sharp continuation, sometimes psychological factors such as time pressure, 'shock value', or knowing the opponent's strengths and weaknesses, also figure into the chess struggle. As with all intuitive leaps, a strong player must carefully weigh the risks of psychological 'gambits', versus the potential benefits.

1 Lasker's intuition served him well, as he knew that Marshall loved to play with the initiative. He took the small calculated risk of playing a difficult sacrifice, and then succeeded in setting Marshall very difficult problems by meeting his less-than-perfect defense with a series of strong forcing moves. It is with good reason that Lasker is considered one of the toughest, and psychologically most astute, players of all time.

Ex 12.5 Shabalov-Yandemirov Moscow 2003 After 1.♕ xe4 ♘ xe4 2.♗ xg7 ♔ xg7 3.♗ d5, Shabalov probably didn't trust the piece sac 3...♘ xc3 4.♗ xa8 ♗ a6 5.♗ c6 ♗ xf1

3.♖ xf8+ ♗ xf8 4.♕ xf6! and on 4...♗ xh6 5.♖ e1! wins the queen.
Black should play 4...♗ b7, remaining a pawn down. 3. ♗ xf8 ♕ xh4

Ex 12.8 Van der Wiel-Van Wely Brussels 1993 White's fortress seems like a tough nut to crack, but the stunning 1... g5!! resolves the issue by tactical means: 2.fxg5 It's mate on 2.♖ xf6 g4# or 2.♗ xg5 ♖ xh6+ 3.♗ xh6 ♖ h5#. 2... ♖ xh6 3.gxh6 ♖ h5 4.h7 ♔ f4! Removing the stalemate threat and winning by zugzwang; 0-1 . Ex 12.9 Frey Beckman-Liu Wenzhe Lucerne 1982 The e4-pawn proves to be the lynchpin of Black's position after a quiet forcing shot: 1.h3! : 1...gxh3 Or 1...g3 2.♘ h1!, winning a crucial pawn. 2.g4! ♕ d7 A futile attempt to muddy the waters, since White gains material, and a huge positional pull, after 2...♗ c8 3.♘ dxe4 ♕ e7 4.g5. 3.gxf5 ♕ xf5 4. ♔ h2 1-0 White repels the attack and keeps an extra piece.

Ex 12.27 Jussupow-Kasparov Riga 1995 The forcing retreat 1... ♗ e7! initiates White into a world of troubles. In the main line 2.f4 ♕ e3! 3.♗ f3 b4 (3...♗ c5 4.♖ d8!), Black's initiative becomes too strong, with the opposite-colored bishops favoring the attacker. So White tries to conjure up some active play with 2. ♖ h1 , intending to meet 2...♗ xg5 with the speculative 3.♗ xh5!?, but the more Black moves backwards, the stronger his threats become: 2... ♕ b7! 3. ♗ f3 ♖ a8! 0-1 . Ex 12.28 Inarkiev-Kharlov Sochi 2004 Well-executed endgame mating themes figure in the decisive combination 1... ♖ xb3! .

Ex 12.29 Komarov-Shumilin Moscow 1939 White's counterplay is much too troublesome after 1...♘ xc6? 2.♖ xb6!, e.g. 2...♔ f8 3.bxc6 ♔ e7?? 4.c7!. Only the quiet forcing move
1... ♔ g7! wins convincingly, by denying the white rook a saving
check to escape the pin after 2. ♖ xb6 ♘ xb5! 0-1 . Ex 12.30 A.Ivanov-Hertan Newburgh 1997 White parlays his initiative into an elegant brute force win of material with 1. ♖ c5! ♕ d3 2. ♕ xd3 ♗ xd3 3. ♖ xc6! ♗ b5 . The last trick, since White's powerful two pieces and Black's weaknesses will eventually tell after 3...bxc6 4.♘ c5. 4. ♖ cxe6 ♗ xa4 5. ♖ xf6+! 1-0 Gaining a decisive second ♙ after 5...♔ xf6 6.♗ e5+.

CHAPTER 13
The Hertan Hierarchy: a tool for teaching better calculation skills This article first appeared in 'The Chess Instructor' - New In Chess 2009. After several years of working on forcing moves with students, I created a brief analytical check list, to help students remember to cover all the bases in their search for strong moves. I also encouraged them to use this checklist during private study, and to write their answers for future review. This practice helped us diagnose which aspects of the student's analysis needed special attention. This 'cheat sheet', which I jokingly called the 'Hertan Hierarchy', became a valuable tool to use with students during lessons, while analysing their own or master games. The Hertan Hierarchy begins the process of bringing master-level calculation techniques within the grasp of average players. The analytical questions it poses reflect the thought process which masters go through automatically, without requiring conscious thought. Of course, such a device does not replace the talent, experience and hard work needed to excel at brute force calculation of variations. But I found that this system did improve students' calculation skills over time, by giving them a better 'road map' to find their way in practical positions. Below I present the Hertan Hierarchy with some useful practical examples of the concepts presented. Afterwards, there is a 'raw version' to use as a handout for students' use. It goes without saying that most of the usefulness of this checklist comes from the teacher's skill in helping the student absorb the concepts; it is designed as a simple teaching aid, and not meant to replace the deeper study of tactics and strategy necessary for maximal learning. This tool is well- suited for use with new tournament players, but I have found parts of it useful for players up to the 1800-1900 level who need help organizing their calculation processes. Opponent makes a move - What is he/she threatening? - Is there a direct (one move) mate threat or attack on a piece? - What about a 2-3 move sequence of forcing moves? - Did the piece moved uncover a threat by a different piece? Option A: opponent's move did make a threat A1. Check again: is the threat real? If I let him or her carry it out, do I have a forcing move at the end which turns the tables ('the sting at the end of the scorpion's tail')? Hess-A.Ivanov
USA 2008
Faced with the double threat on b2/d4, I suspect that most club players would choose 1.♗ xf5?! gxf5 2.O-O-O, but this line eases Black's defensive task by ridding him of the weak g6-pawn and enabling him to contest the g-file. Hess improved by daring Black to execute his threat with 1. ♘ a4! , when 1...♕ xd4 loses to the neat forcing line 2.e6+! ♔ xe6 3.♗ xf5+. White retained a big advantage after 1... ♕ c7 2. ♖ g1 e6 3.O-O-O . Here is a more dramatic example: Gligoric-Commons Lone Pine 1972 Black accepted a big disadvantage with 1...♔ b7?? because he did not want to fall for the traps 1...♘ b6+?? 2.cxb6 or 1... ♘ e5+(!) 2. ♗ xe5 ♖ xd1 3. ♗ xc7 , 'winning a piece'. But he could have turned grief to joy by remembering to analyse the consequences of letting White carry out his 'threat': 3...e5! , the 'scorpion's sting', leads to mate! If opponent's threat is real: A2. Can I make an equal or stronger threat ('EST') ? This is a crucial first question which club players often forget to ask, leading to 'knee-jerk defence' and many lost opportunities. First, did the opponent's move ignore my threat, and if so, would carrying it out lead to my advantage? Second, did his move allow me a new forcing possibility which trumps his threat? Equal or stronger threats are extremely important to consider, for strategic and tactical reasons. Tactically, they have the power to turn the battle around, and concrete analysis often proves that they are correct. Strategically, they help you pursue your own positional objectives rather than simply responding to the opponent's threats. So while 'EST's' are often dead wrong, they must be considered first, before defending, when faced with a threat: all other things being equal, they are often the strongest options. Vyzhmanavin-Tukmakov Novosibirsk 1986 How many club players would worry themselves sick trying to stem White's mating threats with 1...♖ f7 ? But it is doubtful that Tukmakov considered this move at all, since strong masters are in the habit of always analysing the most forcing move first:
1... ♕ h3+!! 2. ♔ xh3
Or 2.gxh3 ♖ xf2#.
2... ♖ h1#
Bronstein-M.Gurevich Brussels rapid 1993 When you attack, every tempo is precious, and a well-placed EST may be the margin of success. In rapid play especially, it could be a fatal error to let Black live with 1.♕ h4 ♕ b5 (1...♕ d6 is also possible) 2.h6 ♕ b1+ 3.♔ h2 ♕ b8+ 4.♔ h3 g5!. But Bronstein has foreseen an equal or stronger threat which decides the battle at once:
1.h6! ♖ g8
Alternatives: 1...♘ xg5 2.hxg7#; 1...♖ xe7 2.♕ xg7+! ♘ xg7 3.♖ f8#.
2.hxg7+ ♘ xg7 3. ♕ xg7+
Or 3.♘ g6+. 1-0 If I can't effectively make an equal or stronger threat: A3. Can I defend actively ? Do I have a defensive move that meets the threat, but also furthers my goals, for instance by developing a new piece, or moving a piece to a better square? Tiviakov-Vasiukov Elista 1996 In this critical position, many club players would settle for 1...♖ c8?, but instead Black found an active defence against the invasion 2.♖ d8+ which turned the course of the battle:
1... ♘ e6!
Uncovering a strong attack on f3.
2. ♘ g5
White is relying on this thrust to keep the initiative since 2...♘ xg5??
3.♖ d8+ wins, but Black has prepared a nasty reply. 2.♕ h3 allows
the surprising 2...♕ f5! 3.♕ xf5 gxf5 4.♘ d2 ♗ f4, tying White in knots, although in this line, 4.♗ g3! is a tougher defence. Also bad for White is 2.♕ e3 ♗ d4! with mating ideas after 3.♖ xd4 ♘ xd4 4.♕ xd4 (4.♘ g5! offers better defensive chances, although
4...♘ f5 5.♘ xf7 ♘ xe3 6.♘ h6+ ♔ g7 7.♗ xe3 ♖ a2 still leaves
White suffering in the ending) 4...♕ xf3+ 5.♔ g1 ♖ c1+ or 3.♕ d3 ♖ xf2! (3...♗ xf2, hoping for 4.♕ xc2? ♕ xf3 mate, is not clear after
4.♖ f1!) 4.♘ xf2 ♗ xf2 and Black should win.
2.♔ g2 may have been best, but Black has clearly taken over the
initiative.
2... ♕ b7! 3. ♘ e4
Not 3.♘ xe6 ♕ xf3+ 4.♔ g1 ♕ xf2+, or 3.♔ g1 ♗ f4! 4.♕ h3 ♘ xg5
5.♖ d8+ ♔ f7 6.♖ d7+ ♔ e8!.
3... ♖ xf2! 4. ♘ xf2 ♕ xf3+ 5. ♔ g1 ♗ d4 6. ♖ xd4
Worse is 6.♖ d2 ♘ f4 7.♕ g5 (7.♔ f1 ♕ g2+ 8.♔ e1 ♕ g1#) 7...♘ h3+. 6... ♘ xd4 and Black converted the pawn-up ending. If I can't defend actively: A4. Can I defend flexibly ? In other words, can I stop the threat without tying down my pieces too much, limiting my choice of future plans, or unnecessarily committing to a particular pawn structure? Queen's Gambit - Orthodox Defence In this well-known tabiya, Black has a slight problem: how to develop the ♗ c8 without allowing 1...♘ b6? 2.♗ xf6 ♗ xf6 3.♗ xh7+ ? He would like to achieve the freeing 1...♘ e4, but here this would drop a pawn to 2.♗ xe4! dxe4 3.♘ xe4. Many have been tempted to commit the kingside pawns with 1...h6 or 1...g6, but both of these moves are slow, and take away the useful g6-square from Black's pieces. To make matters worse, Black may double his folly by falling for the tempting stock trap 1...h6 2.♗ f4! (better than 2.♗ h4 ♘ e4!)
2...♘ h5? 3.♘ xd5!, winning a pawn in view of 3...cxd5 4.♗ c7!.
Fortunately, Black can defend h7 more flexibly with 1... ♘ f8! when after 2. ♖ ab1 he has a variety of viable plans including 2...♘ e4, 2... ♗ e6 intending the manoeuvre ...♘ h5, ...g7-g6, ...♘ g7 and ...♗ f5, or 2...♗ g4, aiming to trade off White's good bishop with ...♗ g4- h5-g6. The old game Taimanov-Nezhmetdinov, Kiev 1954, went 2... a5!? 3.a3 ♘ e4!? 4. ♗ xe7 ♕ xe7 5.b4 axb4 6.axb4 ♘ g6 7.b5 ♗ g4 8. ♘ d2? (8.♘ e1!) ♘ xd2 9. ♕ xd2 ♘ h4! with a dangerous attack. As early as move two, we can demonstrate the advantages of structural flexibility: Black can obtain normal chances with the EST 2...♘ f6, or the defence 2...♘ c6, which is both active and flexible. But Philidor's 2... d6 is a much rarer visitor to master practice. Why commit so soon to the structure d6/e5, rather than reserving the right to develop the ♗ f8 more actively to c5 or b4, which often provides the key to equality? Tyomkin-Kantsler Israel 1997 In addition to structural (pawn) flexibility, flexible defence may mean reserving maximum options for piece placement in response to the opponent's line of attack. Every beginner knows that it isn't healthy to leave your king on the same open file as the enemy rook, so the correct move 1... ♔ h8 isn't hard to find. But since White has no immediate threat on g7, what would be the harm of throwing in 1...♘ f5?! first? The answer is flexibility. Since ...♔ h8 must be played anyway, why not play it now, and see White's next move before committing to a specific piece formation? In fact, the ♘ e7 found another very useful home and Black managed to consolidate and win after 2. ♘ e4 ♕ d7
3.h5 ♘ gf5 4.h6 ♘ g6 5. ♘ g5 b5 6. ♘ e6 bxc4 7. ♕ e4 ♖ f7 8. ♖ g5 ♘ fe7 9.
♘ c3 ♖ b8 10. ♕ xc4 ♕ b7 11.b3 ♕ b4 12. ♘ e4 ♕ a3+ 13. ♔ b1 ♖ b4 14. ♕ d3 ♖ xe4! 15. ♖ xg6 ♖ f2 0-1 . If I can't defend flexibly: A5. If all else fails, can I defend the threat at all, without serious negative consequences? (Don't give up material for nothing!) Arkell-Hertan Hastings 1993/94 At first glance Black seems to have no special problems here, but appearances are deceptive. Masters would rather eat nails than enter a rook ending with rooks forced to defend passively, usually a recipe for disaster. So I didn't like 1...♕ c6 2.♕ xc6 ♖ xc6 3.♖ a1 a5 (3...a6 leaves both rooks tied down) 4.♖ b5 ♖ ac8 5.♖ a3! when 5...♖ d8 6.♖ b3 ♖ dd6 is forced, since the attempt at counterplay 5...♖ c2 6.♖ xb6 ♖ d2 7.♖ c3 fails. I followed my plan of 'active' defence with 1... ♖ c6? , completely overlooking the strength of 2. ♖ a1! , when due to the threat of 3.♖ xb6!, winning a pawn, I had to enter a far worse 'dead rook' ending with 2...♕ d5 3.♕ xd5 exd5 4.♖ b5 ♖ d6 5.♖ a6 ♔ f7. I resigned after 29 more moves of pitiful grovelling. But surely Black's position can't be that bad yet, and I later discovered how I could have equalized by just defending the threat : 1...♖ ab8! 2.♖ a1 a5 3.♖ b5 ♖ c2 and Black's problems are over, since now 4.♖ a3? is met by 4...♖ xb2!. If I can't stop his threat at all: A6. If I must give up material, can I achieve significant counterplay? Akopian-Bareev Enghien-les-Bains 2004 Black must accept the loss of a pawn, since 1...gxh6?? allows 2.♕ xh6+ ♔ g8 3.♖ g3+ ♔ f7 4.♖ g7+ ♔ e8 5.♕ g6+ and mate, while
1...e5? allows the resource 2.♕ c1 ♘ d3 3.♗ e3!. But
grandmasterly vision has foreseen that the coming counterplay overshadows the pawn deficit:
1... ♖ d7! 2. ♗ f4 e5 3.h6 g6 4. ♗ g3 ♖ fd8 5.h7 ♖ d2 6. ♗ xe5
6.♕ xe5? loses immediately to 6...♖ d1+.
6... ♕ e6!
With the devilish point 7.♕ xc5 ♕ f5+!, mating.
7. ♗ xf6+ ♕ xf6 8. ♕ c3 ♕ xc3 9. ♖ xc3 ♖ xf2 10. ♖ c2 ♖ dd2 0-1
If I can't obtain counterplay: A7. As a last resort, if I must lose material without significant counterplay, how can I resist most stubbornly? Unfortunately, most club players resort to this 'nuclear option' far too soon, especially against stronger players! Going into a 'defensive crouch' has the least chance of practical success, but if it really is the only option, you must try to do it well! Hertan-Ibragimov Biel 1993 White has a long and difficult defensive task here, with three weak pawn islands and the more exposed king. Armed with some endgame knowledge, the decision to pitch a pawn to reach a theoretically defensible rook ending was fairly easy:
1. ♕ c4! ♕ xc4
The black queen can't stay on the optimal d5-g2 diagonal due to the 'perpetual harassment' 1...♕ f3 2.♕ f1 ♕ e4 3.♕ d3, so he is persuaded to accept the gift.
2. ♖ xc4 ♖ xe3 3. ♖ xa4 ♖ b3 4.d5!
White is able to liquidate the queenside with this shot. Of course not
4.♖ b4? ♖ xb4, holding the material but reaching a positionally lost
king+pawn ending.
4...cxd5
Not 4...c5? 5.♖ a8+ and 6.d6.
5. ♖ d4 ♖ xb2 6. ♖ xd5 ♔ g7 7. ♖ d6 g5 8.a4 g4 9.a5 f6 10.a6 bxa6 11. ♖ xa6
White has lived to obtain a tenable ending, but I still had to suffer many more moves before reaching this position:
1.hxg3+!
My first intention was to throw away six hours of work with 1.♖ xg3?? ♖ xg3 2.hxg3+ ♔ h3! 3.g4 f2. Thank God I remembered to analyse the forcing variations, even in this 'simple' ending! Now 1... ♖ xg3 2.♖ xg3 ♔ xg3 3.♔ g1 is of course drawn.
1... ♔ h3 2. ♖ g8 ♖ a2 3. ♔ g1 1⁄2-1⁄2
Learning how to hold such difficult endings was a key milestone on my road to mastery. Reading Rook Endings by Smyslov and Levenfish was a turning point, teaching me that active defence was the key to successful rook play. (But this book is quite advanced, and I choose the beautiful book Pandolfini's Endgame Course to get students excited about endings.) My advice to class players would be this: learn to trust activity far more, and distrust the prospects of curling up into a defensive ball! Also the obvious lesson: like it or not, studying endings will make you a better player. Option B: opponent's move did not make a threat B1. What are my most forcing options? Do I have a 1-3 move combination leading to mate or win of material? The most important analytical tool is the practice of always analysing the most forcing moves first . Forcing moves are not inherently better; in fact, the most forcing option in a given position usually loses. The reason that forcing moves must be examined first is that when they do work, they are strongest and most efficient . A very common chess sin is wasting inordinate amounts of time on dead ends. But in the next diagram, once the correct forcing move is found, we see at once that there is no need to analyse anything else... J.Polgar-I.Sokolov Hoogeveen 2003 In a review of Forcing Chess Moves in The Guardian , Danny King humorously referred to my approach as 'analysing every forcing move, no matter how daft...' While I would phrase it a little differently, I use the metaphor 'computer eyes' to help students find winning forcing moves like 1. ♖ f5! which seem too 'daft' for most club players to consider, especially 2-3 moves earlier in analysis. Computers are not hindered by human bias which makes such moves look 'impossible'; they analyse the most forcing moves first, then draw conclusions. A good knowledge of stock master combinations makes the task of finding the fork trick 1.♖ f5! much easier, and is a vital part of a good chess education. If I don't have any effective forcing options: Now we are in the territory of strategy and positional play. Of course, strategic considerations are too broad to be contained in such a crude tool, so I settled for a 'shortlist' of a few useful positional reminders. I chose to emphasize the concept of playing to one's strength, since most of my students were far too easily distracted from pursuing (or even understanding) their own positional trumps. Of course, those with a more aggressive character might have the opposite problem! Rather than giving point-by-point illustrations of the themes in this more general section, I present the remaining 'hierarchy' with a few favorite examples. The ideas are simple and I leave it to you to tailor these positional guidelines to the specific needs of your students. The basic question of chess strategy is the following: B2. How do I improve my position?? It's a very tough question which is basically a lifelong learning process, but here's a very good question to start club players thinking in the right direction: Where's my strength ? Meaning, in which area of the board are my pieces and pawns able to act most effectively? There are three options: the kingside, the queenside, or the centre. To answer this question, consider the following: • Where do my pawns control more space? In which direction is my pawn structure 'pointing'? • Where are most of my pieces posted - or pointing? • Where do I have open files for my rooks? If I don't have any, where can I create them by forcing pawn trades? • Does my opponent have any attackable weaknesses (structure, king position, under-development, etc.?) Once you decide where your strength is, the next important strategic decision becomes: How can I play to my strength ? Yes, there is a time and a place for responding to your opponent's strength first, when objective judgment shows that this is necessary. But most club players are much too easily swayed from the crucial strategic imperative to make playing to one's strength the 'default option'. Playing to your strength is rather like the strategic equivalent of always analysing the most forcing moves first. All things being equal, it is better to advance your own agenda than to respond to your opponent's. Here are a few questions to ask yourself when considering options for playing to your strength: • can I move a piece to a better (more mobile or aggressive) square? • can I open a new line of attack on the side where I'm better? • can I activate a piece that's not doing much, or transfer another piece into the attack zone? • can I trade or chase off a key defender? • can I exploit or provoke a structural weakness on the side where I'm better? Blackburne-Cohn Berlin 1897 White has a space advantage in the centre and on the queenside. He could try to exploit Black's backward e6-pawn, but this nut would be tough to crack. The fearsome Englishman makes a great strategic decision: a pawn sacrifice which shifts all the play to the queenside, where White is more active and, more importantly, where the black king lives:
1.c4! ♕ xd4?
1...c5! was necessary, with a tough battle ahead.
2. ♗ e3 ♕ h4
2...♕ e5 3.f4.
3.dxc5 ♗ e5 4.c6!
In a few short moves, the attack is crashing through. This shot opens decisive lines on the side where White is better.
4... ♗ xa1 5.cxd7+ ♖ xd7 6. ♖ xa1 g5 7. ♗ xa7 g4 8. ♕ xe6 ♕ e7 9. ♕ xe7 ♖
xe7 10. ♗ xf5+ Black resigned. Nezhmetdinov-Kamyshov Gorky 1950 In critical positions, the ability to play to one's strength determines the whole character of the game. White has an advantage in the centre, with an aggressive knight, major pieces on open lines, and the pawn on c4 threatening to break down the barriers to Black's precarious king. But if White retreats with, say, 1.♘ f3, then after 1... O-O-O all these factors come to naught; the king has flown, and in fact Black has a central advantage with his solid pawn mass! So the coming sacrifice was not some accidental tactical resource, it was the whole point of White's strategic plan!
1. ♘ xf7! ♔ xf7 2. ♕ h5+ ♔ e7
Of course it is not enough to say that the piece sacrifice is positionally justified: White had to calculate the forcing moves to assure at least adequate compensation. Now the king runs into White's central onslaught, but also losing is 2...♔ g8 3.♕ g4+ ♗ g7
4.♕ xe6+ ♔ f8 5.♕ d6+ ♔ g8 6.♖ e7.
3.cxd5 e5 4.f4! ♕ xd5 5.fxe5 f5 6.e6 ♔ f6 7.h4! ♗ c5+ 8. ♔ h1 ♕ xe6 9. ♕ h6+
Black resigned. Maliangkay-Mohrlok cr 1999 Class players need to learn the vital difference between 'cosmetic' weaknesses and real ones. A cosmetic weakness is a pawn structure or square that looks ugly, while a real weakness is something which can be realistically attacked! A weakness on an open file is a very serious matter, being subject to easy pressure by the enemy major pieces. In this position, Black can't defend his weak a- and c-pawns in the long run, so to focus on doing so would throw away his chances. Instead he must play to his strength on the kingside, and hope to generate enough activity there to compensate for his structural holes:
1...g5! 2. ♖ fa1 h5 3. ♘ h2
White is persuaded to divert some pieces away from his attacking zone, to forestall Black's play. It is helpful that Black's activity comes on the side where White's king lives.
3...g4 4.hxg4 hxg4 5. ♗ f1 ♖ d4
Black has developed his own chances and later missed a forced draw before eventually succumbing. Alekhine-Teichmann Berlin 1921 White's obvious strength is on the kingside, by virtue of the e4-pawn and the half-open f-file. But Black has no weaknesses there other than f7, which is well-defended. Black, on the other hand, is very passively placed and has difficulty claiming 'strength' in any sector. Alekhine makes a key strategic decision to open a new 'front' in the centre. For this purpose, the ♗ e3 is in the way, and White begins with an important maneuver to improve the position of this piece:
1. ♕ f5 ♔ h8 2. ♗ f2! ♖ d8 3. ♗ g3 ♘ de5
4.d4!
Remember our discussion about 'real vs. cosmetic' weaknesses? Black's doubled c-pawns were not really weak, since they were not on an open file or subject to a realistic plan of attack. So White cheerfully exchanges one to further his central assault, and paradoxically, the 'undoubled' c7-pawn soon becomes a real weakness, backward on an open file!
4...cxd4 5.cxd4 ♘ c6 6.d5!
White cedes the e5-square in return for controlling the rest of the board!
6... ♘ ce5 7.h4 ♕ c5+ 8. ♔ h2 f6 9. ♖ c1 ♕ d6 10. ♖ c6 ♕ e7
10...♕ d7 11.♕ xd7 ♖ xd7 12.h5 ♘ g4+ 13.♔ h3 ♘ 6e5 14.♖ fc1!.
11. ♖ e6 ♕ d7 12.h5 ♘ e7 13. ♕ h3 ♘ f7 14. ♗ f4 h6 15. ♕ c3 ♘ d6 16. ♗
xh6! ♘ xe4
16...gxh6 17.♖ fxf6.
17. ♖ xe4 ♘ xd5 18. ♕ c1 1-0
On 18...gxh6, 19.♗ xd5 decides. Nunn-King Germany Bundesliga 1986 White's strength is on the kingside, where his pieces are massed and the f5-pawn constricts Black. Yet Black's defences seem quite solid, and he is actively placed in the centre. In fact, his last move
1...♖ d6-d5? missed a chance to completely equalize with 1...♕
xf5! 2.♘ xe4 ♕ e6!. Instead, he fell for a trap which improves the position of a key white piece so dramatically, that the game is nearly decided: 1.g4! ♕ c7
1...♘ d3 2.♘ xe4.
2. ♘ h3! Nunn's hidden idea. Suddenly the ghastly threat of
smothered mate by ♘ h3-f4-g6 wins material.

♕ d5 9. ♕ c4 1-0 On the next pages you can find a printable, 'raw' version of the hierarchy for use with students. The Hertan Hierarchy Opponent makes a move - What is he/she threatening? - Is there a direct (one move) mate threat or attack on a piece? - What about a 2-3 move sequence of forcing moves? - Did the piece moved uncover a threat by a different piece? Option A: opponent's move did make a threat A1. Check again: is the threat real? If I let him or her carry it out, do I have a forcing move at the end which turns the tables ('the sting at the end of the scorpion's tail')? If opponent's threat is real: A2. Can I make an equal or stronger threat? This is a crucial first question which club players often forget to ask, leading to 'knee-jerk defence' and many lost opportunities. First, did the opponent's move ignore my threat, and if so, would carrying it out lead to my advantage? Second, did his move allow me a new forcing possibility which trumps his threat? If I can't effectively make an Equal or Stronger Threat: A3. Can I defend actively? Do I have a defensive move that meets the threat, but also furthers my goals, for instance by developing a new piece, or moving a piece to a better square? If no: A4. Can I defend flexibly? In other words, can I stop the threat without tying down my pieces too much, limiting my choice of future plans, or unnecessarily committing to a certain pawn structure? If no: A5. If all else fails, can I defend the threat at all , without serious negative consequences? (Don't give up material for nothing!) If no: A6. If I must give up material, can I achieve significant counterplay? If no: A7. If I must lose material without counterplay, how can I resist most stubbornly? Option B: opponent's move did not make a threat B1. What are my most forcing options? The most important analytical tool is the practice of always analysing the most forcing moves first . Do I have a 1-3 move combination leading to mate or win of material? If I don't have any effective forcing options: Now we are in the territory of strategy and positional play. The basic question of chess strategy is this: B2. How do I improve my position?? A very tough question which is basically a lifelong learning process, but here's a good question to start club players thinking in the right direction: Where's my strength?

Can I provoke a structural weakness on the side where I'm better? Afterthought Thirty five years ago, I noticed that all of my students, from beginners up to 2100 rated players, had a critical flaw in their calculation process. Most of them had already mastered the information taught in standard tactics books about pins, forks, skewers and other tactical devices, yet they continued to miss critical forcing moves in nearly every game! Over a series of lessons, I tried to program into their brains a new approach to analyzing positions, beginning with the question: 'OK, what are the most forcing options in this position?' Pretty quickly, I began to see encouraging results; a 1400 player would suddenly find a crisp 2-3 move forcing sequence and defeat a much stronger player. I decided then on the concept of writing a different kind of tactics book, which focused on the mental process involved in correct analysis. A few others had written important books on this subject, such as Kotov's classic Think Like a Grandmaster ; but that book was in many respects too advanced for my students. I wanted my book to break down the calculations to a level accessible to everyone (with a little hard work), and to focus sharp attention on the task of analyzing forcing moves. I had a lot of fun collecting beautiful master combinations over the years, and amassed a fairly large library for my research. Over time, I began to think about the different types of forcing moves which were hardest to find, and why some were harder than others. I noticed how often my students would describe a certain move with a negative label ('It's too passive', 'It ruins my pawn structure') before they had even analyzed it! I enjoyed correcting their prejudices: 'It may ruin your pawn structure, but it also wins by force!'. I realized that a computer never refuses to calculate a forcing move 'because it ruins my pawn structure!'; it calculates first, then draws conclusions. As I thought more about this idea, I hatched the concept of 'computer eyes' as a tool for overcoming human bias. As I prepared to let this 'baby' enter the world, I developed a habit that is difficult to break: the habit of collecting beautiful forcing moves from master games! Sometime during this process, I realized that I was writing not only for students and lovers of the beauty of chess; I was also completing my own education! I had read many books during my own development as a player, but it turns out that there was a wealth of stock forcing moves that I had never fully absorbed. The legendary Soviet School of Chess, which completely dominated the chess world for decades, considered stock master combinations as part of the 'ABC's' of chess. Students would be shown hundreds, thousands of forcing moves from master games, and critical endings, before they ever picked up an opening book. These lessons would be gathered into tactics manuals, but most of them were rather dry; just hundreds of diagrams, and perhaps only the first 'key' move given as the answer. Such Soviet School books were ideal for working with a trainer, who could give the student a few exercises as 'homework' and help him fill in all the details during the next lesson. Since every promising student was given a trainer, there was no need for tactics books that spelled out every analytical detail more clearly, or gave more wordy or interesting explanations: the teacher would take care of all that. So, in the first two chapters of this book, I offered the reader a chance to begin your 'Soviet School' training. We have covered a wide variety of crucial stock forcing moves, and I have tried to take the place of your 'trainer' by explaining each position in depth and helping you work out all the variations. In the subsequent chapters, we took an in-depth look at human bias, and helped you understand the types of forcing moves which humans tend to miss, and how to remedy this problem in your own games with the use of computer eyes. In the chapter 'Intuition and creativity', we took a step beyond concrete analysis of forcing moves, and looked at some of the practical, psychological, and analytical tools which help masters create enduring works of chess artistry. Finally, the Hertan Hierarchy provides a practical tool, which can help you catch many of the elusive winning moves which may have slipped through your net in the past. In the end, I think I wrote the book which I needed to read at the beginning of my career ; a thorough coverage of the concept of forcing moves, which grounds the reader in stock master combinations and gives you the tools to start finding more forcing chess moves in your own games. I hope that I have enhanced your appreciation for the incredible beauty and variety of forcing moves, and started you on a lifelong 'education' of your own, taking a special interest in looking for, and thoroughly understanding, as many master combinations as you can find. You can do it just for pleasure, but I have no doubt that it will also make you a much stronger player. Charles Hertan June 2019 Glossary of terms The symbol * signifies an item which can be found elsewhere in this glossary. Antipositional move Move which destroys its own pawn structure or traps its own pieces and therefore often looks 'ugly'. Attack When a *piece is threatened by *capture or a king is threatened by *checkmate. Back rank The first *rank (on White's side) or the eighth rank (on Black's side) on the board. Battery When a piece on a line or *file, *rank or *diagonal is standing before a piece of the same color that commands that file, rank or diagonal. As soon as the former is removed, a threat is created by the latter. Block/blockade When a *piece occupies the *square before an enemy piece or enemy pawn, preventing the latter from moving in the desired direction. Bolthole When a pawn is moved forward to create an escape possibility for its own king (see also *Luft). Blitz game Quick game in which each player gets five minutes (or less) for all his moves. Board sight The ability to mentally envision where the pieces are, and what they can do, at each step of a calculation. Bread-and-butter tactic A short combination that forces material gain. Brute force (calculation) Accurate calculation of a series of *forcing moves, like a computer. Capture When a *piece is removed by an enemy piece, which takes the place of the captured piece. Castling A move by king and rook that serves to bring the former into safety and to activate the latter. The king is moved sideways two *squares from its original square. At the same time, a rook moves from its original square to the adjacent square on the other side of the king. Castling can take place either to the *queenside or to the *kingside. It is the only way in chess of moving two *pieces in one turn. A player may only castle if both the king and rook in question have not moved before, his king is not in *check, and his king does not pass a square on which it would be in check. Check When a king is under direct *attack by an opposing *piece. A check can be countered either by moving the king, or by *capturing the piece that gives the check, or by placing a piece between the king and the piece that gives check. Checkmate When a king is under direct *attack by an opposing *piece and there is no way to deal with the threat. Clearance When a *square, *rank, *file or *diagonal is vacated so that another *piece can occupy it. Combination A clever and more or less forced sequence of moves which usually results in an advantage for the player who starts the sequence. Computer eyes Chess vision combining two skills: *brute force calculation and objectivity. Corridor Mate When a king is in check and cannot escape from its file; 'a *back rank mate turned sideways'. Cover When a *piece or a *square is *protected from *attacks; as soon as an enemy piece *captures the covered piece or occupies the covered square, it is (re-)captured by the covering piece. Also: *Protect. Decoy When a *piece is lured (e.g. by a sacrifice) towards a *square on which it can be attacked or, in the case of a king, *checked and/or *mated. Deflection/Diversion When a *piece is lured away from an important *square, *file, *rank or *diagonal. Diagonal A line of *squares running from top left to bottom right or the other way round (e.g. 'the a1-h8 diagonal', 'the light-squared diagonal'). Discovered attack/check When a *piece is removed in such a way that a piece of the same colour standing behind it, *attacks an enemy piece or, in case of discovered check, gives check to the enemy king. See also *Battery. Diversion sacrifice Sacrifice that draws off a key defender by force, for example on the *back rank. Double attack When one *piece is *attacked by two enemy pieces at the same time, or when one piece attacks two enemy pieces at the same time (for the latter, see also *Fork). Double check When a king is *attacked by two enemy *pieces at the same time (by means of a *discovered check). A double check can only be countered by a king move. Doubled/tripled pawns Two/three pawns of one color on the same file. Endgame/Ending The final phase of the game when few *pieces are left on the board. En passant When a pawn which has just moved forward two *squares from its original square, is *captured by an enemy pawn standing immediately beside it. This capturing pawn then occupies the square behind the captured pawn. En prise When a *piece is under *attack and threatened with *capture. Equal or Stronger Threat (EST) Counter-threat that at least outbalances the threat a player is facing himself. Exchange 1) When both sides *capture *pieces that are of equal value. Synonyms are 'trading' or 'swapping' pieces. 2) The surplus in value of a rook above a *minor piece (bishop or knight). The player who possesses the rook is 'an exchange up', he has 'won the exchange'. Exposed king King unprotected by its own *pieces and, especially, its own pawns. Fianchetto Development of a bishop to the second *square of the knight *file (to b2 or g2 for White, to b7 or g7 for Black). File A line of *squares from the top to the bottom of the board (e.g. 'the e- file'). Forcing move Move that limits the opponent's options by making a concrete threat, such as mate or gain of material. Forcing retreat Retreating move that limits the opponent's options by creating a threat. Fork *Attacking two or more enemy *pieces simultaneously with the same piece. Fortress Defensive formation designed to prevent the opponent from breaking through. Human bias Deficiencies of a human player by, for instance, 'blind spots' in thinking. Hybrid combination A combination of mate threats with threats of material gain. In-between check/move *Check or move interrupting a logical sequence of moves (see *Zwischenschach, *Zwischenzug). Isolated pawn A pawn which does not have any fellow pawns on adjacent *files and therefore cannot be protected by a fellow pawn. Key move Important/decisive move. Kingside The board half on the white player's right (i.e. the e-, f-, g- and h- *files). Liquidation Entering the next phase of the game by the *exchange of a number of *pieces. Luft When a pawn is moved forward to create an escape possibility for its own king (see also *Bolthole). Major piece A queen or a rook. Mate See *Checkmate. Mating net A situation where a king is *attacked by enemy *pieces and eventually cannot escape the *mate threat. Middlegame The phase of the game that follows after the *opening and precedes the *endgame. Minor piece A bishop or a knight. Obstruction When a *piece is placed on a *rank, *file or *diagonal in such a way that it interrupts the range of an enemy piece. Open file/rank/diagonal A *rank, *file or *diagonal whose *squares are not occupied by *pieces or pawns. Opening The initial phase of the game. Opposition A situation where two kings are facing each other with one *square in between. The king that is forced to move 'loses' the opposition and has to make way for the opponent. When the distance between the two kings is larger, but one of the two cannot avoid 'losing' the opposition, the other is said to have the 'distant opposition'. Overburdening/Overcharge When a *piece has to protect more than one fellow piece or *square at the same time and is not able to maintain this situation satisfactorily. Passed pawn A pawn that has no enemy pawns on the same or an adjacent *file. Its *promotion can only be prevented by enemy *pieces. Penetration The forceful entering of the enemy position. Perpetual (check) An unstoppable series of checks that neither player can avoid without risking a loss. This means that the game ends in a draw. Piece In general, all chessmen apart from the pawns. In this book, mostly queen, rook, bishop and knight are meant, since many tactical motifs (sacrifices, for instance) cannot be carried out by a king. Pin *Attack on a *piece that cannot move away without exposing a more valuable piece behind it. Pins take place on a *rank, *file or *diagonal. Promotion When a pawn reaches the *back rank, it is turned into a more valuable *piece (queen, rook, bishop or knight). Protect See *Cover. Queenside The board half on the white player's left (i.e. the a-, b-, c- and d- *files). Quiet connector Tricky, decisive *quiet move in the midst of an 'active' *forcing sequence. Quiet move Move which does not capture material or give *check. Racheschach A *check 'out of spite', given by a player who is already lost, which does not alter the outcome. Rank A line of *squares running from side to side (e.g. 'the third rank'). Sacrifice When material is deliberately given up for other gains. Selection Finding the key options and choosing. Self-blocking (sacrifice) Forcing an enemy piece (e.g. by a *sacrifice) to an escape square for its own king. Skewer When a *piece *attacks two enemy pieces that are standing on the same *rank, *file or *diagonal. Smothered Mate When a king is mated in the corner, hemmed in by its own *pieces and pawns. Square One of the 64 sections on the chess board that can be occupied by a pawn, *piece or king. Spite check See *Racheschach.

In keeping with this focus I have come to rely more and more on good databases, which give us unprecedented access to chess wisdom in the computer era. I find it increasingly true that the best master tactics today occur in the highest level tournaments. Competition at the top is fiercer than ever, and the road to victory is often paved with extraordinarily deep calculation. Following the greats online is an especially rewarding way to continually sharpen your 'computer eyes'. While there are many great online sources to choose from, I usually utilize Chessgames.com , or New in Chess' Nicbase, to keep up on the latest tournaments, research tactical themes, or explore the games of interesting players. Checking more than one source sometimes reveals lesser known games, even by famous players. If you prefer a print source to keep abreast of the best master tactics in elite tournaments, I'm far from alone in declaring New In Chess Magazine second to none. Here's a partial list of books which were important sources of FCM material, along with some which most strongly influenced my chess development: Garry Kasparov, My Great Predecessors, Vols. 1-5 , Everyman 2003-04. My vote for the best chess books ever written. David Bronstein, 200 Open Games , Batsford (English translation)
1973. A lesser-known gem by one of the most creative chess minds.
Richard Réti, Masters of the Chessboard , Dover Edition 1976. Bernard Cafferty and Mark Taimanov, Soviet Championships , Cadogan 1988. Ger van Perlo, Van Perlo's Endgame Tactics , 2nd Edition, New In Chess 2014. Werner Golz and Paul Keres, Chess Combination as a Fine Art , Crowood 1989. Walter Korn, The Brilliant Touch in Chess - 240 Fascinating Positions Commented On, Dover 1966. Stands out among older tactics books for its excellent research. Amatzia Avni, Creative Chess , Everyman Chess 1997. Georges Renaud and Victor Kahn, The Art of the Checkmate , Dover
1962. An essential primer for stock forcing moves and a fun read.
Hans Kmoch, Pawn Power in Chess , Dover Edition 1990. Absorbing all the ins and outs of pawn play is a vastly underrated strength- builder. Bruce Pandolfini, Pandolfini's Endgame Course , Fireside 2008. The one 'desert island' endings book that all club players must read to have some grounding in theory. Grigory Levenfish and Vasily Smyslov, Rook Endings , Batsford (English translation) 1971. Andrew Soltis and Edgar McCormick, US Championships 1845-1996 , McFarland (2nd Edition) 1997. Laszlo Polgar, Chess: 5334 Problems, Combinations and Games , Black Dog & Leventhal edition 2013. The amazing compilation of curriculum materials gathered by the author to instruct his famous daughters. Hundreds of 'win in two' positions are great 'computer eyes' training tools. I'm a big fan of master game compilations. Here are some favourites pertaining to fine tactics: Shibut, Macon, Morphy and the Evolution of Chess Theory , Caissa 1993. Robert G.Wade and Kevin O'Connell, The Complete Games of Bobby Fischer , Holt and Co. 1972. Alexei Shirov, Fire on Board, Cadogan 1997.
