At the Palace ofYoung Pioneers I joined the chess section in the fifth or sixth class. In those days the Soviet grading system included a Fifth and a Fourth Category. I managed to attain those categories in no time, but afterwards there was a halt in my progress. It was for that reason that I took the 1 960 edition of Maizelis's Chess with me on summer holiday, intending to study it thoroughly. It was an interesting and pleasant read. Large format, large diagrams, a wealth of striking examples. In both content and presentation, this was a very "tasty'' book! I particularly liked the short section entitled "Entertainment Pages" with which nearly every chapter concluded. It contained amusing puzzles with witty, well-written captions. Interpolations like this embellish a book and make the material easier to absorb. When studying a serious subject it sometimes helps to divert yourself a little, to read something for pleasure, without at the same time straying too far from the main topic. Mter all, these "Entertainment Pages" consist of chess material with illuminating ideas, albeit conveyed in a different and lighter form. Many of the examples stuck in my memory; I even placed them in my card-index for later use. Having studied the Chess book, I scored 1 0 out of 10 in my next tournament - more than fulfilling the norm for the Third Category. After that, I made it to the Second with a score of 1 0 out of 1 1 , then progressed to First Category within a short interval. Regrettably I was not personally acquainted with Ilya Lvovich Maizelis (1 894- 1 978), but it is obvious he possessed a high level of culture. Though not exceptionally strong as a practical player, he was an excellent analyst; he made a study of pawn endgames and the "rook versus pawns" ending (about which he wrote a short book) . Ilya Lvovich associated with several illustrious chessplayers, for example with Lasker in the pre-war years when the second World Champion was resident in Moscow. He even translated Lasker's famous Manual of Chess into Russian, as well as the story How Victor Became a Chess Master. In the pages of Maizelis's book you can find quite a few "traces" of the author's association with great players. Chess is a teaching manual with an excellent selection of material convincingly presented, and a bright outward design. At the same time it is more than just a textbook. It is a story of chess as a whole, and thus its tide wholly fits its content. Of course, this is not a book for the very young (writers for them go about it differently), but it will be very interesting and useful for schoolchildren and adults alike. Maizelis lived in the Soviet era, and naturally he could not help incorporating certain ideological cliches into his text. This sprinkling of ideology is none too obtrusive, however, and is not experienced as an eyesore.
8 The Soviet Chess Primer
A notable fact is that many of my acquaintances - strong adult players - have wanted to acquire Maizelis's Chess. The book is very dear to me too; now and again I open it and read through a few pages afresh. Incidentally, the copy that I studied as a child was "borrowed" by someone long ago, and it wasn't possible to find another one in a shop and buy it. Then, in the seventies, I was in Sweden with the "Burevestnik" team, and we visited a chess bookshop there. Some Russian language publications were in stock, and Maizelis's book was among them. I bought it at once money was no object! But afterwards the same thing happened to this copy: someone took it to read and didn't bring it back, so I had to look for it all over again ... I now have my third or fourth copy in my library. I am glad that Maizelis's remarkable work has finally been re-issued and will be available to many lovers of chess. It will, I hope, be both useful and pleasurable to acquaint yourselves with it. Mark Dvoretsky Foreword by Emanuel Lasker The Meaning of Chess The history of chess goes back a very long way. Many thousands of years ago - no one knows exactly when - people began to satisfy their need for play by fabricating primitive game boards, marking lines on them, arranging little objects like stones or pieces of wood on the squares (or on the intersections of the lines) and moving these objects around. In this way the game of draughts and many others arose. Illustrations of such games have been discovered in the ancient Egyptian pyramids. They are mentioned in old songs and sagas. One Chinese game is said to date back four thousand years; the game of chess has been known in India for more than two thousand. The Indian form of chess gave rise to a large number of games that are widespread across Asia. Indian chess travelled across Persia and penetrated to Europe. The rules of the game changed - they were made more rational. Chess underwent its last significant change about four hundred years ago in Italy. But it still took a long time for the new rules to gain universal acceptance in Europe. What became "European" chess is now widely disseminated in all parts of the world. In India, chess was an image of war. The chessboard figured as a battlefield. The pieces were divided between two hostile camps that were distinguished from each other by their colours (black and white). The classification of pieces according to their types of weapon was modelled on the ancient Indian army. At the head of the army stood the king, and it was for his life that the battle was fought. The army consisted of fighting elephants and horsemen, distinguished by their great strength and mobility, as well as lightly armed infantry. The pieces on the chessboard were moved by the players in keeping with the prescribed rules. Each player strove to eliminate his opponent's pieces and reach the enemy king, in order finally to "put him to death". With the passage of time, the character of real war changed. The time when the life of one person - the king -was the prize at stake in the battle, receded into the distant past. So did the time when army elephants had taken part in hostilities. Yet the game of chess still retained the character it had had at birth. Even today, a chessplayer moving his pieces according to the established rules can view himself as a warlord in a battle where success depends on how well he has devised his plan. If we wanted to represent modern warfare in chess, we would need to alter all the rules of the game. The players, however, would gain precisely nothing from such an alteration, because what interests them is purely the execution and evaluation of cleverly conceived plans; and any rules that make this possible will serve - provided they are acknowledged by both opponents and strictly observed by them. All the better when the game possesses a very long history and a vast literature, from which advice and instruction may be gleaned. 1 0 Th e Soviet Chess Primer In the life of man there are frequent situations where he is forced to deliberate on how to exert his powers and surmount obstacles of some kind. For this he needs to evolve a definite plan. The faculty of thought distinguishes man from an animal that acts out of instinct. Over the course of centuries, man has been working veritable miracles: he subjugates deserts, making them fruitful; he conquers vast areas, he erects cities; he builds up a social life; he brings forth monuments of art that triumph over time; he creates science and awe-inspiring technology. Creation proceeds by dint of struggle and effort. In the process of this struggle, man is not always successful in discerning the right plan; mistakes occur. Man is prone to yield to preconceived notions and prejudices rather than to reason and carefully considered judgement. He is inclined to put his trust in guile and ruse rather than in strength guided by reason. It is not enough for him to resolve to avoid these errors, for in the heat of the struggle such intentions are forgotten. A chessplayer is greatly benefited, and his culture enhanced, by the fact that he accustoms himself to struggle in the very process of playing, and that he trains himself to form indispensable plans on the basis of much experience. There is no doubt that combat training was a purpose that the inventor or inventors of chess (on the origin of the game we have no exact information) will have had in mind. This is evident from the rules of the game which are not borrowed from the experience of real war. In chess, both sides have the same quantity of forces at their disposal, with the same type of arms. In real life this does not occur. In this respect the game is more just than life, where brute force frequently prevails. In chess a successful outcome is determined not by the quantity of forces but by their skilful management. In chess, the opponents take it in turns to move; in a real battle, it goes without saying that a commander will not keep waiting to see what his opponent is going to undertake. This recognition of the opponent is invested with a profound meaning. Both players have an equal right of suffrage, and the opinion that is upheld is not the one that was voiced first but the one that triumphed in the debate. The student of chess thus acquires the civilized habit of hearing his opponent out - and more than that, of patiently waiting for his opinion. In this manner the student gradually familiarizes himself with the principles of combat. Thanks to the exercise he derives from playing, he will gradually achieve mastery. But he should beware of mechanically following the advice of others. He should not play by rote. Studying material from books or from the words of a teacher is not enough - the student must form his own judgements and stand by them persistently. Otherwise he will be playing chess in the same way that a parrot pronounces words - without understanding their sense. Personally I was never in my life given a more valuable lesson than on the day when I witnessed a serious game of chess between masters for the first time. My brother, together with one other master, was playing against a different pair of masters in consultation with each other. The two pairs were in different rooms. I was assigned the duty (being still a youth at the time) of relaying each move to the opponents as it was played. As messenger I was privy to the consultations, I followed the moves that were being suggested and listened attentively to the arguments "for" and "against". The discussion of individual moves would sometimes last a quarter of an hour and more, before the consulting masters reached a final decision. This taught me to work towards The Meaning of Chess 1 1 a conclusion according to a plan, and to trust my own judgements. Even if I quite often found myself on the wrong track, I still gained far more from experience, especially from the defeats I suffered, than from blind faith in the authority of some book or some master or other. A defeat would distress me; it would always make me try to identify my mistake and work out some better continuations. In this way, in the course of time, I acquired a keen awareness of what is good and what is bad, what is genuinely strong and what amounts to a mere delusive mirage. After that I was no longer frightened by my opponents' cunning tricks; I learned to trust in strength more than in cunning, even though this is much the more difficult path. And eventually it turned out that by following that path, I had something of value to give. Of course the student should not neglect the experience that has accumulated before him. It is not for nothing that chess has lasted for more than two millennia. It is not in vain that the game has produced great masters who have astounded their contemporaries and later generations by the skill of their play. It was not in vain that the theory of the game was developed and given practical application. It is not in vain that tournaments and matches between masters have been held and the games have been analysed so thoroughly. The student should acquaint himself with what is best in all of this, even if he can only devote a small amount of time to the work. Yet however pleased he may be to feel himself the heir to these abundant labours, he should still endeavour to assimilate them creatively. To that end he should subject them to analysis, and in the process he should not only investigate something that is recommended but also something that is quite the opposite, so as to be in a position to draw independent conclusions. In this way he will acquire the most valuable thing - a capacity for independent judgement and independent creativity - and after serving his term of chess apprenticeship he may become a fully-fledged artist of the game. The perfecting of technique alone is a thankless task. What it perfects is a dead capability, suited to winning games against ignorant opponents and nothing else - whereas the faculty of thinking and conceiving plans remains constantly alive and can bring benefit in the most unexpected manner, not only in chess but in life itself. This faculty is highly important and is precisely what a chessplayer ought to develop by exercise. Even if a shortage of free time prevents him from devoting much attention to chess, and he cannot therefore reach a high level of mastery in the game, nonetheless the habit he acquires of independently creating plans is of significant value in itself, and will stand him in good stead in various situations in life. The effort expended in acquiring and developing this ability will not be wasted. Emanuel Lasker (World Champion 1 894-192 1 ) Moscow, January 1 936 lhis article was written for the first edition of this book. 1 2 The Soviet Chess Primer
ADVICE TO BEGINNERS
When reading a chess book you need to use a chess board and pieces. Set up the diagrammed positions on your board, then carry out the indicated moves while pondering the explanations. At the same time, consider some moves that are not given in the book, and try to figure out what results they lead to. This develops your independent thinking, and the knowledge you acquire will "stick" particularly well. Should questions arise that you can't deal with on your own, turn for explanation to a more experienced chessplayer. Sometimes a diagram in a chess book doesn't reproduce the whole board but just that part of it where the relevant pieces are. This is mainly done so as to make some particular pattern of pieces easier to memorize, but sometimes the object is to allow more examples to be included. At first, until you have reached at least Third Category standard (about 1 600 rating), all the examples (except possibly the very simplest) need to be played out on a chessboard, rather than in your head. The point is that clear visualization is essential for absorbing the material in the best way, and in addition you need to get used to viewing the chessboard as a whole. As your level of chess skill rises, you should try solving some of the less complicated examples in your head, so as to train yourself gradually to calculate moves in advance. Don't try to work through a large number of examples at one session. The moment you feel some fatigue, stop reading and put your chess set aside. The important thing is not how much you have read, but how well you have assimilated it. You are therefore not advised to study the book for more than one or two hours a day. The opinion of former World Champion Lasker is interesting: he considered that you could successfully keep up your chess skill and competitive form by spending no more than 30-40 minutes daily on exercises (analysis). Reading the book must be combined with practical play. Play with your friends, take part in tournaments. Don't get obsessed with playing at fast time rates ("blitz" chess). Such games are of some use only to high-graded players; for the junior categories they are downright harmful, as they teach superficial play and add nothing to your experience. Keep the scoresheets of the games you play, so that later (either on your own or with friends) you can work out where you or your opponent went wrong, and how it would have been possible to play better. Not only the games you lost should be examined like this, but also those you won; the successful outcome doesn't in any way mean that all your moves were good ones. Some initial advice on how to begin a game in accordance with the general principles of development can be obtained from Chapter 7. For more specific information, turn to Chapter 10. Your chief goal should be to learn how to interpret the positions in a game, how to evaluate them and analyse the various possibilities. The path to a better understanding of chess, the path to mastery, is one that all players tread gradually. In this book you will find a body of instruction and advice which will in some measure make your task easier. Chapter 1 The Game Explained
1. THE CHESS BOARD AND PIECES - OBJECT OF THE GAME
The chessboard is placed in such a way that there is a light-coloured corner square at each player's right. Each opponent's "army" consists of eight pawns and eight pieces (a king, a queen, rwo rooks, rwo bishops and rwo knights) . The rwo opponents' forces are numerically equal, and differ from each other only in colour. Irrespective of their actual tint, they are referred to as "white" and "black''. The pieces and pawns are represented in print as follows: White King (abbreviation: K) Queen (abbreviation: Q) Rook (abbreviation: R) Bishop (abbreviation: B) Knight (abbreviation: N) Pawn (abbreviation: P) The abbreviation for the pawn is used only rarely. Black At the start of the game, the players' forces are arranged facing each other, as in illustration 1 . (The image of the board and pieces is called a "diagram".) The half of the board in which the kings are placed at the start is called the kingside (more exactly this means the three outermost columns in that half). The opposite area is the queenside. 1 4 The Soviet Chess Primer 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 Queens ide 1 Black Kingside ����� �� ���
[diagram]
Queenside Kingside White The arrangement of the pieces in the starting position, which is the same for White and Black, needs to be memorized. In the corners there are the rooks, then come the knights and bishops, and in the middle the kings and queens - with the white queen placed on a light square and the black queen on a dark square, while the kings are on the opposite coloured squares. The pawns are often identified by the pieces they stand in front of - thus we speak of a rook's pawn, a knight's or bishop's pawn, the queen's pawn or the king's pawn. Pieces with different names have different ways of moving. Pieces can be moved on the board in all directions, but pawns can only ever move forwards. Pawns also have some other peculiarities which we shall meet with presently. However, from now on, whenever we need to speak of pieces and pawns together, we shall simply say "pieces" for brevity. The object of the game is to overpower the opponent's king - to "checkmate" it. We shall explain this in detail later. Modern chess pieces King Queen Rook Bishop Knight Pawn
2. IDENTIFYING THE SQUARES
RECORDING A POSITION
To identify the squares of the chessboard, we use the following simple and convenient system. All the ranks, that is the horizontal rows of squares running from left to right, are designated by the numbers from 1 to 8. All the vertical files, or columns pointing in the direction of the opponent, are designated by the letters from "a' to "h". Each square of the board is identified by the letter of the column and the number of the row in which it is located. By using these names for the squares and the abbreviations or symbols for the pieces, we can concisely record any position on the board. For instance, the starting position of the game (see Diagram 1) can be recorded as follows. White- mel , 1Mfdl , E:al and h i , J.ci and fl, lLlbl and gl , ,0,a2, b2, c2, d2, e2, f2, g2, h2. Black- me8, 1Mfd8, E:a8 and h8, J.c8 and ffi, lLlb8 and g8, ,0,a7, b7, c7, d7, e7, f7, g7, h7. In the above scheme, the most important pieces are placed first, followed by all the others according to their "strength". The functions and strength of the pieces will be discussed in due course. The board is always visualized, so to speak, from White's point of view. Thus for example Chapter 1 - The Game Explained 1 5 in Diagram 1 , all the black pawns are arranged on the seventh rank, and although from Black's viewpoint this rank is the second, he still calls it the seventh just as White does. He regards his own back rank as the eighth, in other words the counting starts from White's back rank. Every chessplayer needs to be well acquainted with the nomenclature of the squares on the board (see Diagrams 2 and 3).

3. THE ORDER OF PLAY
MOVES AND CAPTURES
A game of chess is played by making moves on the board, that is, by transferring pieces from one square to another. The players make moves alternately. The game is always started by the player with the white pieces. The question as to which of the opponents will have White is decided by lot. In successive games, the players take White and Black alternately. In tournaments, tables giving the order of play are used. After White's first move, Black carries out his first move, then White's second move follows, and so on. Only a single piece can be moved at each turn. A piece cannot be placed on a square already occupied by a piece of the same colour. A piece can be placed on a square occupied by an enemy piece, as long as the move conforms to the rules. In this case the enemy piece is "captured", that is, it has to be removed from the board (you cannot of course capture pieces of your own).
4. THE MOVES OF THE PIECES
ATTACK AND DEFENCE - EXCHANGES
THE ROOK
The rook moves along the ranks and files, in any direction and over any distance.
[diagram]
1 6 Th e Soviet Chess Primer In the position in Diagram 4, the rook can move to any of the fourteen squares indicated. The mobility of the rook, as of any other piece, is reduced if there are other pieces in its line of movement.
[diagram]
In the position in Diagram 5, there are only nine vacant squares that the white rook can move to. The rook may also, however, capture the enemy pawn on e7 (by removing the pawn from the board and occupying the e7-square itself). Thus, the total number of possible moves for the rook in Diagram 5 is ten.
THE BISHOP
The bishop moves only along the diagonals, in any direction and over any distance. 6
[diagram]
The greatest number of moves that a bishop may have at its disposal is 13 (this is when the bishop is placed in the centre, that is on one of the squares e4, d4, e5 and d5). On b7, the bishop would have only 9 moves available, and on al it would have no more than 7. Thus the bishop's mobility is less than that of the rook, which on an open board always has 14 moves, no matter which square it is on. Furthermore the bishop operates on squares of one colour only - the light squares or the dark squares (hence we use the expressions "light-squared bishop" and "dark-squared bishop"), whereas all the squares on the board, irrespective of colour, are accessible to the rook's action. This all goes to show that the rook is stronger than the bishop.
THE QUEEN
The queen is the strongest piece of all; it can move like a rook and like a bishop. On an open board it has a choice of 27 moves from any of the centre squares.
[diagram]
Thanks to its immense mobility and also to its option of making diagonal moves on either Chapter 1 - The Game Explained 1 7 the light or the dark squares, the queen proves to be a good deal stronger than a rook and bishop combined. 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 8 An ancient puzzle
[diagram]
In this diagram, eight queens are placed in such a way that not one of them is within capturing range of another. In 1 862, Carl Jaenisch proved that 92 such configurations are possible. From the solutions he gave, we have selected the one that is simplest in outward appearance. Try to find another one for yoursel£
THE KNIGHT
The knight's move is more involved than that of the other pieces. It can jump in any direction across one square and onto a square of the opposite colour to the one it is starting from. The knight, so to speak, takes a path that is mid-way between a rook's move and a bishop's move. But whereas the rook and bishop can go any distance, the knight only jumps across one rank or file. The rook, bishop and queen, unlike the knight, are long-range pieces. 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1
[diagram]
The greatest number of moves that a knight may have at its disposal is eight. This is when it isn't too close to the edge of the board. On a1, the knight would only have two moves - to b3 and c2. It is important to note the knight's characteristic of changing the colour of its square with every move. It is owing to this that all the squares on the board are accessible to it. In this respect the knight has an advantage over the bishop which considerably surpasses it in mobility and long-range action. Another advantage of the knight is its greater capacity for multiple strikes: in theory it can attack eight enemy objects at once, while the bishop can only attack four (though these things never actually happen in practice). These advantages and shortcomings approximately cancel each other out, so that the knight is considered equal in strength to the bishop. Unlike the other pieces, the knight has the right to jump over pieces of its own or the opposite colour. 1 8 Th e Soviet Chess Primer
[diagram]
In Diagram 10, the knight may move to any of the six squares that are marked; it cannot go to a4, as that square is occupied by a pawn of its own colour. By moving to a6, the knight is jumping over enemy pawns. The knight may also capture the pawn on e6, but in that case it is placing itself under attack from the black bishop on c8; so, since any piece is more valuable than a pawn, the capture on e6 is unfavourable to White. The pawn on e6, as we say, is protected by the bishop. If the knight moves to b7, it will be under protection from the white bishop on f3. If the black bishop captures the knight on b7, it will be captured by the bishop on f3 in return. This is called "exchanging" a piece. The bishop is equal to the knight in strength, hence neither opponent has reason to fear this exchange. In other cases, the pieces captured may be of unequal value; for instance, the so-called "minor" pieces (bishop and knight) are weaker than the "major" pieces - queen and rook. Here we can speak of an exchange only perhaps if two minor pieces are obtained for a rook, or three for a queen. This means that when exchanging you need to have a precise grasp of the relative strength of the pieces. We shall go into this in detail later (see page 60). An ancient puzzle Move a knight round all the squares of the chessboard without landing on any square twice, in such a way that from the final square the knight may move straight to the square it started from. 1 1
[diagram]
We give you the solution straight away. The numbers indicate the order in which the knight must visit the squares. Looking through the solution just once will give you a better grasp of the way a knight moves. (From the numerous published solutions, we have selected one of those deriving from Jaenisch. Its special characteristic is that the numbers in any rank or file add up to 260. Apart from d3, the starting square could be not only d6 but also c2 or c7, f2 or fl. If you draw lines to mark out each step of the knight's route, a complete symmetrical picture will emerge.)
THE KING
The king moves in any direction, either orthogonally (that is, along the file or rank) or diagonally, but only one square at a time. Chapter 1 - The Game Explained 1 9
[diagram]
The maximum number of moves available to the king is eight. What is special about the king is that the rules of the game forbid you to place it on a square that is under attack, in other words a square within the capturing range of an enemy piece. It follows that the king cannot capture a piece that is protected.
[diagram]
In this situation White can capture the unprotected rook on h6, which his king is attacking from the square g7. The king may also move to g8 or h8, but not to f6, f7 or g6. It does not have the right to take either the knight on f8 or the pawn on h7, since they are protected by other black pieces. The black king in this position has one move only - to e7.
5. THE PAWN'S MOVE - CAPTURING
"EN PASSANT" - PAWN PROMOTION
The pawn is weaker than any of the other pieces, since it moves only forwards along the file and only one square at a time. This rule has, however, one exception: if a pawn has not yet moved - in other words if it is still on the second (or seventh) rank - then it may, if desired, make a double advance, crossing over one vacant square and landing on the 4th rank (or the 5th rank for Black). The pawn's capturing move is not the same as its ordinary move; in this respect the pawn differs from all the other pieces. To make a capture, the pawn goes one square diagonally forward. It conforms to the general rule, however, in occupying the square from which the captured piece has been removed.
[diagram]
If it is White to move here, he can take the pawn on b6 with his pawn on a5. The latter may also move to a6; in that case it will be under attack from the black pawn on b7.
20 The Soviet Chess Primer
The black pawn on b6 has already moved (it can only have reached this square by making a capture from a7 or c7); at this moment it can only move to b5 or capture on a5. The pawn on b2 has not yet moved - it is still on its starting square. It can therefore move to either b3 or b4. By playing b2-b4 White would be defending his pawn on a5 which at present is under attack. The pawns on h6 and h7 have no moves at all; they are "blocking" each other. The pawn on f4 directs its attack against the squares e3 and g3. lfWhite moves his pawn from g2 to g3, the pawn on f4 will be able to capture it. However, ifWhite jumps across the attacked square by playing g2-g4, this does not deprive the black pawn of the right to capture; it may still take the white pawn by moving to g3, just as if the pawn on g2 had only gone one square forward. This rype of capture is called a capture "en passant". The following set of diagrams illustrates it. f g h Initial position 14a f g h White has played g2-g4 f g h Black has captured 'en passant" The capture en passant can only occur on the following move, that is, as an immediate reply to White's g2-g4; after any other move, the right to capture en passant is lost. Let us make further use of Diagram 14 to explain some chess terminology. Pawns such as those on b2 and g2 are called "backward", since the pawns on the adjacent a- and h-files have moved further forward. The pawns on f4 and h7 are called "isolated" since they cannot be defended by other pawns. There are "doubled isolated" pawns on b6 and b7. If Black captures on a5, he will be disentangling his pawns and they will become "united", that is capable of defending each other. When a pawn reaches the last rank (the 8th for White, the 1st for Black), it is immediately removed from the board, and the player chooses any other piece of the same colour {except a king) to put in the pawn's place. In this way he may place a second queen on the board (or even a third, etc.), or he may insert a rook or a minor piece (bishop or knight). Usually, the strongest piece - the queen - is chosen. The pawn's promotion to a piece is counted as a single move. Chapter 1 - The Game Explained 2 1
[diagram]
In the position in Diagram 1 5, by playing ...c2-cl , Black can obtain a queen on the cl square. In that case the queen can be captured by the knight on e2, whereupon Black (with his bishop on a3) wins a piece in return for his pawn. If it is White to move, he can take the knight on b8 with his pawn on a7 and place a queen or another piece on the b8-square (after removing the black knight and the pawn). Black cannot forestall this by playing his bishop to d6, as White also has the option of moving his pawn straight forward and queening on a8. The pawns on c2 and a7 (and also the one on f6) are called "passed pawns", since no enemy pawn can place an obstacle in their "path to queening". In Diagram 1 5 White could also take the pawn on f6 with his knight ("sacrificing a knight for a pawn"). Then if the pawn on g7 takes the knight, the white pawn on g6 b ecomes " passed" an d can promote to a queen within two moves, seeing that none of Black's pieces can hold it up.
6. CHECK AND MATE
The object of the game, as stated before, is to overpower the enemy king - to checkmate it (for checkmate we also simply say "mate") . This defines the role of all the pieces on the board: in the last resort, they are attacking the opponent's king and defending their own. The king's downfall signifies loss of the game. The king does not have the right to place itself under attack from a hostile piece. If one of the players does accidentally put his king under attack, then the king will not of course be captured, as the rules of the game do not permit this. The player who made the illegal move merely has his mistake pointed out, and he is obliged to make some other move with his king. In general, according to the rules of the game, a piece that has been touched must be moved. This rule is very strictly observed. If you want to adjust a piece on its square, you tell your opponent first. (The French phrase "j' adoube" traditionally serves this purpose.) Otherwise you have to move the touched piece, or capture it if it is an enemy one. If, however, the piece cannot be moved or captured, any other move may be played. If any piece positions itself in such a way that the enemy king could be captured on the following move, this threat to the king is called a "check". It is not obligatory to warn your opponent out loud that he is in check, and usually this is not done. When your king is in check, you must free yourself from the check with your next move. There are three ways: ( 1) Capture the piece that is giving check. (2) Move a piece to block the line along which the enemy piece is delivering its threat (your king is then shielded from the check). And finally:
22 The Soviet Chess Primer
(3) Move your king to one of the adjacent squares that are not under attack from your opponent. If all three methods of defence against check prove impossible, this means that the king has been mated.
[diagram]
In this position, Black can give check to the white king by moving his queen to a1 or b l . In reply, White can only shield his king by moving his rook to g 1 . After that, Black may take the rook with his queen; or he may capture it with the pawn on h2, promoting to a new queen (or a rook). In either case, White is mated. The queen on a2 can also give check by going to a8 (or d5) . If the white rook blocks the check on c6 (or g2), Black captures it, again giving mate. In Position 1 5 which we examined earlier, White could mate the black king by moving his knight from g4 to f2. It sometimes happens that a move by one piece opens up the line of action of a different piece that is placed behind it, resulting in check to the opposing king. A check of this type is called a "discovered check''; if the piece that moves away gives check itself at the same time, this brings about a "double check''. Here is an example: 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1
[diagram]
Any move of the bishop in Position 17 results in a discovered check from the rook on a7. If the bishop goes to f5, it gives double check. The only defence against a double check is a move of the king. If the bishop goes for instance to e8, then Black has the option, apart from moving his king, of shielding it by playing his knight from h5 to g7. (After that, the knight is unable to move, as it is not allowed to expose the king to attack from the rook; it is "pinned" and deprived of mobility.) If during a game you unexpectedly notice that one of the kings has been left in check, you must go back to the position where the check was given, and resume the game only from that point. Other irregularities are handled in the same way, for instance if the starting position was set up wrongly or a piece has made an illegal move, etc. In all such cases you must correct the error and continue playing from that point in the game. In view of its special significance, the king is subject to constant threats and cannot therefore take an active part in the opening and middle phases of the game. In the final phase, however, its role increases. Chapter 1 - The Game Explained 23 A fun exercise
[diagram]
Mate in one move, in 47 diffe rent ways Diagram 18 (a position from J. Babson, 1 882) gives an example of mate in one move. In this position, mating in one move is not difficult, but it turns out that there are forty-seven ways of doing so. In practical play, such positions don't arise - this puzzle is in the nature of a joke. To solve the puzzle, you need to remember that pawns can be promoted to various types of piece.
SOLUTION
In Diagram 1 8, the queen gives mate in six ways (on six squares), and the pawn on d3 has one mating move. In addition, mate arises from discovered checks: fourteen moves with the rook on b2, eleven with the bishop on d5, seven with the knight on f5. Finally, White can mate by promoting pawns: two of them can promote to queen or bishop (four options); two others can promote to queen or rook (four further options). The total is 47 moves.
7. DRAW - PERPETUAL CHECK
STALEMATE
Checkmating one of the kings is not possible in every game of chess. In many cases neither player can achieve victory, and the game is counted as a draw. The following are types of drawn game: (I) When one of the kings is subjected to "perpetual check", that is a continuous series of checks from which it has no way of sheltering. (2) When one of the players is "stalemated". That means he is in a position where neither his king nor any other piece can make a move, and his king is not at present in check (if it were in check, this would be checkmate). In the position in Diagram 1 6 the weaker side can save itself from loss, thanks to perpetual check or stalemate. White, if it is his move, gives check on g3 with his rook. If the black king captures the rook, White is stalemated. If the king goes to h4, the rook checks again on g4, and so on. Black either allows perpetual check, or else (by taking the rook) stalemates his opponent. In either case the game is a draw. A rook like this, persistently chasing the king and intent on perishing as a means to avoid losin� , the game, may be called a "rook running amok . The next two diagrams, 1 9 and 20, show instances of perpetual check that occur extremely often in practical play.
24 The Soviet Chess Primer
[diagram]
Black gives perpetual check on the squares f2 and fl . 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1
[diagram]
Here Black gives perpetual check on the squares h4 and e l . (3) The next case of a drawn outcome is when neither side is left with sufficient forces to mate the enemy king.
[diagram]
Here only the kings are left on the board. With his last move (�g6) White has placed his king vis-a-vis that of his opponent. Such a situation of the kings is called "the opposition''; White "gained the opposition'' with that move. Although White has restricted the freedom of manoeuvre of the black king (which can't go to any square on the 7th rank), there are still two squares on the 8th rank that Black can move to. Neither king can go right up to the other, since neither one has the right to place itself under attack. Obviously the game is a draw. 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1
[diagram]
Chapter 1 - The Game Explained 25 In Positions 22, the stronger side has an extra bishop. The black king in the corner is so cramped as to have no moves whatever. Yet since Black is not in check, a position like this is stalemate - that is, a draw once again. It is not possible to arrange things so that the bishop, while cutting off the king's moves on the 8th rank, gives check at the same time. If the bishop were on f6, the black king would be able to go to g8. Just as before, the position would be clearly drawn. 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1
[diagram]
We have a similar situation when the stronger side has an extra knight. Here too, the position is clearly drawn.
[diagram]
In Positions 24 and 25, Black too has a minor piece - that is, he has more forces than in Positions 22 and 23. And yet - strangely enough! - he has been checkmated. But this is very easy to explain. The black pieces are occupying exceptionally bad positions; they are cramping their own king, depriving it of an essential flight square. These examples show what forces cannot be considered adequate for victory. At the same time, we are beginning to see that a matter of great significance is the arrangement of the pieces - the positions they occupy.
[diagram]
26 The Soviet Chess Primer
In the position in Diagram 26, the forces are equal in quantity but not in quality: we know that the rook is stronger than the bishop. A rook's superiority in strength over a bishop (or knight) is called "the exchange". White, then, is "the exchange up". Is that sufficient to win? It turns out that in this position, it is. If White, in fact, makes a waiting move with his rook - to d8, say - then Black's sole and obligatory reply is ...@h8, whereupon the rook captures the bishop, giving checkmate. 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1
[diagram]
However, if this position is slightly altered by shifting the black king to h8 and the bishop to g8 (see Diagram 27), White's win no longer proves possible. If the rook goes to d8, this gives stalemate. Other possible winning attempts by White are also futile. Here is an example (you would do better to come back to it after mastering the notation of the moves and acquiring some practical experience): l .E:e7 i.c4 2.E:h7t @g8
3.E:c7. White is attacking the bishop and
simultaneously threatening to give mate on c8. However, Black replies 3 ... i.d3t, forcing White to abandon the opposition of the kings - after which the threat of mate disappears, and the game remains drawn. So the question whether your forces are sufficient for victory is decided by the relative strength and positioning of the pieces. Further cases of a drawn game are the following: (4) The two opponents can agree to call the game a draw if they think it futile to continue the struggle (because there are no winning chances). (5) If the same position (with the same side to move) occurs three times (this can come about, for example, through both opponents repeating their moves), a draw may be claimed by one of the players. (6) Also if, during the course of 50 moves, not a single capture has been made on the board and not one pawn has advanced, a player may claim a draw. (Conventionally, "one move" is taken to mean a move by White together with Black's reply.)
8.CASTLING
This is the name given to another possible move in a game of chess: the simultaneous movement of the king and one of the rooks. This is the only case of a move being made with two pieces at once. Each side is permitted to castle only once in the game. An essential prerequisite is that the squares between the king and the rook should not be occupied, either by the player's own pieces or by his opponent's. Castling is carried out like this: the king jumps across one square in the direction of the rook, and the rook stations itself on the other side of the king, on the square next to it. The king may castle towards either the king's rook or the queen's rook, as the player wishes. In the former case we speak of "castling short", and in the latter case "castling long". Chapter 1 - The Game Explained 27 3 2
[diagram]
Position before castling In this situation the king may castle on either side. 3 2
[diagram]
Castling short White has castled on the kingside - that is, the king has moved to g1 and at the same time the rook on h 1 has moved to fl . 3 2
[diagram]
Castling long White has castled on the queenside - the king has moved to c1 while the rook on a1 has gone to d l . For castling to b e possible, the following conditions must be met: (I) The king and rook must be on their original squares and must not have made any moves so far. (2) The squares in between the king and the rook must be vacant. (3) The king must not be in check (you cannot reply to a check by castling), and the king must not be placed in check by the castling move. (4) The square that the king moves across (fl or f8 in the case of castling short, d 1 or d8 for castling long) must not be under attack from any enemy piece. If the rook, not the king, is under attack, or if the rook has to cross over an attacked square, this in no way prevents castling. All these issues are illustrated by Diagram 3 1 . 3 1 In this position, only White can castle - and only on the queenside. Black, if it is his move, could check on f3 with his knight and thereby deprive White of the right to castle at all, seeing that White would have to move his king from its starting position to one of the adjacent squares (he could not reply by castling). Should one of the players castle in contravention of the rules, he must replace his king and rook on their starting squares and carry out a move with his king. The point of castling is that it permits a major change in your king's position (when danger threatens), and also enables a powerful piece the rook - to be brought quickly into play. Preventing your opponent from castling is sometimes highly advantageous.

9. RECORDING THE MOVES- CONVENTIONAL SYMBOLS
For recording the moves of a game, we use so-called "algebraic notation" to indicate the square to which a piece is moved. If the move is made by a piece other than a pawn, we also insert the standard abbreviation or symbol for that piece. In addition, the following signs are normal in chess literature:
X
t tt #
O-O
O-O-O
?? !! !? ?! #t ±++ + -+ 00 captures check double check (often not used, just described as t) mate castles short (kingside) castles long (queenside) any move a weak move a blunder a good move an excellent move a move worth considering a move of doubtful value mate White is slightly better Black is slightly better White is better Black is better White has a decisive advantage Black has a decisive advantage equality with compensation with counterplay unclear Thus, "e4" means that a pawn moves to e4; "Ei:xd6" means that a rook makes a capture on d6; "axb8='1W" means that a pawn on the a-file captures on b8 and promotes to a queen; "exd8=tt::l t" means that a pawn on the e-file makes a capture on d8 and promotes to a knight which gives check to the king; "i.h5tt" indicates a bishop moving to h5 and bringing about a double check. If two pieces of the same type may move to a particular square, we must specifY which one of them is going there. For example, if one rook is on al and the other is on fl, we write Ei:adl or Ei:fd 1 . If there is a knight on a4 and another on a2, the notation is tLl4c3 or tLl2c3. Apart from this "standard" algebraic notation, there is also a "long" version which records both the departure square and the destination square of the piece that is moving. The above moves Chapter 1 - The Game Explained 29 might thus be written as "e2-e4", "l'!dlxd6", "a7xb8=Wf" and so on. Although the long version is perfectly understandable, the short version is used by the overwhelming majority of chess players and publishers. By avoiding any superfluous information, it occupies less space and is quicker to write down. Moves may be written in a column or across the page. As an example, we will take the following opening of a game: l.e4
2.�f3
3 . .Bc4 e5 �c6 �f6 Written across the page, the moves look like 2 l.e4 e5 2 . .Bc4 .Bc5 3.�h5 A lunge that is typical of beginners. We shall later see that moves with the queen in the opening stage are rarely useful and sometimes even harmful to the development of your game. 3 ...d6?? Black has defended his pawn on e5 but has failed to notice that first and foremost he is threatened with mate. The correct course was 3 ... Wfe7 and then 4 ... lt:lf6, bringing a new piece into play ("developing" it) and repelling the white queen. this: l .e4 e5 2.lt:lf3 lt:lc6 3 . .Bc4 lt:lf6 4.�xf7# Or in "full" notation: l .e2-e4 e7 -e5 2.lLlgl-f3 lt:lb8-c6 3 . .ifl-c4 lt:lg8-f6

Take a chess set, start from the initial position (see Diagram 1), and play through some short games in order to master the notation of the moves, the conventional symbols, and some checkmating positions. Where the moves leading up to the mate are not indicated, find them for yourself. Then try solving the "fun exercises". They are not only amusing; in their own way they are also instructive.

It was possible to catch the words " ... to play'' (now his voice grew stronger!) "and mate in four moves." The listeners racked their brains for a long time, but their efforts to mate the black king within four moves came to nothing. "White cannot give mate in four moves here," they finally decided.

Chapter 2 Aim of the Game From our preliminary discussion we already know that the customary finale (conclusion) to a game of chess is checkmate or a draw. We will now try to expand these introductory remarks; first let us study some finishes of a very simple kind.
1. CHECKMATE
The ultimate aim of the game is to checkmate the enemy king. Let us examine some typical mating positions. We will start with those where the mate is given by a rook. Mate with rook 34 35 Mate with rook
36 The Soviet Chess Primer
36 37 Mate with rook In all the above positions, the rook is giving mate on the 8th rank. In practice, the edge of the board is nearly always (with very rare exceptions) the place where checkmate is achieved, as the king's mobility here is extremely limited. In the Diagrams 32-37 the king's escape to the seventh rank is prevented either by its own pieces or by those of the enemy, or sometimes a combination of both. A rook in conjunction with some other piece quite often finishes the game in the following ways: 38 39 Mate with rook 40 41 Mate with rook Checkmate with the queen is illustrated by the next examples. Chapter 2 - Aim of the Game 37 42 43 Mate with queen 44 45 Mate with queen In the positions below, the mate is carried out by minor pieces. 46 47 Mate with bishop 48 49 Mate with knight .38 The Soviet Chess Primer In Positions 46 and 47 a bishop delivers the mate, while the other minor piece prevents the black king from sidestepping to b8. The mate with a knight in Position 49 is a so-called "smothered" mate. A pawn too can give mate just like the other pieces. Positions 50-50a may suffice as an example. 8 7 6 5 Mate with pawn 8 7 6 5 50a The positions we have given are frequently met with in practice, so it is useful to commit them to memory.
2. MATE IN THE SIMPLEST ENDGAMES
Towards the end of the game, one of the players may possess an extra piece while his opponent has only his king left. If the extra piece is a bishop or knight, it cannot give mate (see Diagrams 22 and 23 in Chapter 1). It's a different matter ifa rook - or an even stronger piece, the queen - is left on the board. In this case, winning (using your own king in support) is very simple. In order to mate the enemy king, you have to drive it to the edge of the board, where its mobility will be most severely curtailed (there will be no rank in the king's rear for further retreat). In Diagram 5 1 the kings are in opposition; the black king is already somewhat restricted - all three squares ahead of it on the 5th rank are out of bounds. 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1

Two bishops or a bishop and knight, with the support of their own king, can also give mate. The mate with two bishops can be achieved within 1 8 moves by driving the king into any of the corners. As in the foregoing examples, the winning process demands coordinated play with the pieces. 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 l ..Bf3

Mating with bishop and knight is more difficult; we shall examine this endgame later (see page 1 00).
3. DRAWN GAME
If the game has not been going our way, and the preponderance of force is on our opponent's side, then we must bend our efforts to saving the game in some way or other - we must try to reach a draw. Something was said about draws on page 23. Now let us look at some more examples. A common type of draw is stalemate: 57 58 With his last move Black has made the mistake of depriving the white king of all its squares. White is stalemated. The game is a draw. 8 7 6 5 4 8 7 6 5 4 The Soviet Chess Primer When trying to mate with king and rook or two rooks, you have to play carefully to avoid putting your opponent in a stalemate position - which is just what has happened in Diagrams 59 and 60. Two knights are incapable of giving mate if the opponent defends correctly.
[diagram]
The criticaljuncture: White is in check from h6 In Position 6 1 , if White makes the mistake of �h8?, he will be mated by . ..Ci:Jef7#. But after the correct ci>fll!,the game will end in a draw. 61a
[diagram]
White has made the correct king move In Positions 57-60, the white king was playing a passive role and was stalemated as the result of an error on Black's part. Sometimes, however, the king fights for the draw actively and brings about stalemate by its own efforts. 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1
[diagram]
White to move In Position 62, the black pawn is only one square away from queening. But the promotion square is occupied by Black's own king, and the white king will not let it out of its prison. If it is White's move here, he plays ci>c1 and Black is stalemated.
[diagram]
Chapter 2 - Aim of the Game 43 In Position 63, even the presence of a knight is no help to Black if it is his turn to move. White keeps playing mel and mc2, refusing to be sidetracked even if Black tries offering his knight as a sacrifice - say with ... tDd2. On the other hand ifWhite is to move, he loses - for example 1 .mc1 lDa3, and White is forced to move away to the d-file, freeing the black king's exit. The important thing for White is that the knight and king should match each other in switching the colour of their squares: for instance l. .. tDa3t (the knight occupies a dark square) 2.Qc1 (likewise moving to a dark square), etc. It is now easy to understand that if the white king were on dl {let us say), and the black knight were at the other end of the board - so that White had the choice of moving his king to cl or c2 - then he would need to choose the square of the same colour as that currently occupied by the enemy knight. (Try it and see!) This last example is not the only case where a minor piece and a pawn are unable to win. 64 65 4 4 3 3 2 2 1 1 a b c d a b c d In Position 64, the bishop doesn't control the pawn's queening square, and the white king cannot be driven away from the corner. It can only be stalemated. In Position 65 Black cannot win either, since the white king cannot be forced away from the defence of the b2-pawn. Any tries lead only to stalemate. The king may also be stalemated when the opponent has just one pawn, as in the following positions: 66 67 68 8 1!� 7 �% 6 ' " " "�k "" " � /- Black to move - Stalemate

4. CONDUCTING A PAWN TO ITS
QUEENING SQUARE
An extra pawn in the final phase of the game will often enable us to win, seeing that after conducting the pawn to the far end of the board we can promote it to the strongest piece - the queen. There are, however, positions where one extra pawn is not enough for victory because the stronger side is unable to bring the pawn to its promotion square. 8 7 6 5 White to move - Draw I.d7t @ds 2. @d6 Black is stalemated. 8 7 6 5 White to move wins l.c7 @d7 2.@b7 @_. 3.c8=� White wins. In Diagrams 69 and 70, the slight difference in the placing of the black king is decisive. The whole point is that in the first case Black has the opposition, but not in the second case. This will be explained more fully in Chapter 4, "Techniques of Calculation". If it were Black's move in Position 70, he would play I...@b8, gaining the opposition and drawing. It is worth memorizing the rule for this type of position: if the pawn advances to the 7th rank (for Black, the 2nd) with check, there is no win. If it goes there without check, the game is won. 8 7 6 5 Black to move Black's salvation depends on which square he moves his king to. In Position 71 he retreats with his king to the crucial square c8, so that either move by the white king (to b6 or d6) can be answered by taking the opposition with ...@bs or ...@d8. 8 7 6 5 71a Black has made the sole correct move, and the draw is now assured. Chapter 2 - Aim of the Game 45 8 7 6 5 4 3

Draw, whichever side is to move An attempt to win from Position 72 would lead to stalemate (compare Diagram 67).
[diagram]
White to move - Draw There is no win from Position 73 either. No matter how White continues, it will eventually be stalemate (see Diagrams 66, 68, 71 and 71a) . Yet if Black is to move in this position, White does win. These exceptions to the rule are due to the fact that the pawn is located either on the edge of the board (the rook's file) or on the next file from the edge (the knight's file).
[diagram]
White wins 1. ci>d5 ci>d7 2. ci>c5 ci>d8 3. ci>d6! ci>c8 4. ci>c6 ci>bs 5.h7 Winning. We have now examined all the basic situations that can come about with the pawn on the sixth rank (6th for White, 3rd for Black). It is extremely important for the beginner to set up some examples on a chessboard independently and satisfy himself that he has fully mastered these positions and can infallibly tell what the play from any such position will lead to - win or draw - with either White to move or Black to move. If your pawn - other than a rook's pawn - is on the fifth rank (counting from your own end), then it is always possible to win on condition that your king is in front of the pawn. 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 The Soviet Chess Primer 75 77 a b c d e f g h a b c d e f g h White wins, whichever side is to move White wins, whichever side is to move In Position 75, if it is Black to move and he Then if Black replies l. .. i>d8, this gives plays l ... i>d8, this gives Position 76. Position 78. 76 78 8 8 7 7 6 6 5 5 4 4 3 3 2 2 1 1 a b c d e f g h a b c d e f g h White replies 2.i>b7, taking control of all the squares over which his pawn will advance to queen (c6-c8). Ifi t is White's move in Position 75, he can play I.i>d6 (see Diagram 77). Black is trying to retain the opposition, which is often very useful (recall for instance Diagram 69) . However, with 2.c6, White forces Black to abandon the opposition and wins as in Diagram 70. In Position 77 if it is White to move, he gains the opposition with I.i>c6. Then when the enemy king steps aside to the right or left, Chapter 2 - Aim of the Game 47 White goes to the opposite side as in Position
76. It would be wrong, on the other hand, to
play l .c6, as Black would play l ...�d8, reaching Diagram 69. Positions 75-78 present no difficulties once you have mastered Positions 69-7 1 . If the pawn is on a rook's file and the enemy king controls the queening square - if, that is, the king is in the corner or can get there - then the game will eventually come down to a draw (see Diagrams 72 and 67). The most interesting case is when the pawn is on the knight's file, where the closeness to the edge of the board influences the play - owing to the danger of stalemate. 8 7 6 5 4 3
[diagram]
White wins, whichever side is to move In Position 79, should White play l .g6t, the reply would be l ...�h8!, drawing as in Position
73. Therefore seeing that the pawn cannot yet
advance, White plays: l.�f7 Black can reach Position 80 with his reply:
[diagram]
Again it is White to move, and this time 2.g6? gives stalemate as in Position 68. 1he stalemate arises because Black, being on the edge file, is unable to step to the right. It remains to try to make him go to the left:
2.�g6! �g8 3.�h6! �h8 4.g6 �g8 5.g7
White wins. There are some interesting devices to help you find your bearings quickly in any position where your pawns are advancing to queen; these will be demonstrated in Chapter 4 ("Techniques of Calculation").

Chapter 3 Tactics and Strategy
1. THE CONCEPT OF A CHESS PLAN
In the confined space of the chessboard, the pieces of the two hostile "armies" carry out their operations. They move in various directions, attack, capture, defend themselves - in short, they are in constant confrontation with each other. The diversity of possibilities is a perplexity for the beginner. Can we make sense out of all this? Absolutely! All the changes on the chessboard occur, after all, as a result of the moves of the two players, and these moves are not fortuitous. They are united by an overall purpose - to win, to checkmate the enemy king, to avoid defeat by the opponent. Every move attempts to do something which contributes directly or indirectly to achieving the ultimate aim. Out of such purpose-oriented moves, whole manoeuvres and game plans regularly take shape. The plans must be conceived in advance, and constitute what is known as strategy; the implementation of these plans is the task of tactics. Strategy clarifies what we need to do, what problems have to be solved to attain the end in view; tactics determines how we do this. Tactics solves each problem in its context (in the current situation on the board) by selecting the best moves and ascertaining their logic. Thus in addition to the general strategic plan (the general task), specific tactical plans arise (the specific task). In Position 5 1 (on page 38) we already saw an example of play to execute a certain plan - that of mating the black king with White's king and rook. The plan consisted of driving the king to the edge of the board. The tactical device with the aid of which this gradual constriction took place was a check with the rook when the kings were in opposition. Let us consider another example.

White wins U3h7t Qd8 2. Qe6 Black cannot prevent his opponent from carrying out the plan of:!'%d7 and :!'%xd6, which, although it involves giving up rook for bishop, enables White to win all the black pawns. Exchanging the rook for Black's bishop and pawns is what constitutes White's plan. The tactical means to this end lies in forcing the black king away from the defence of d6. As another example, here is a study by a composer from the past (Diagram 82). Let us follow the solution, observing what White's plan is based on, and how he brings it to fruition. 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 B.

4.g5 Qh8 s.J.d4!
The bishop positions itself in ambush. If Black now tries 5 ... .Bh7, White plays 6.Qxf7, which is checkmate resulting from a discovered check.

White to move Only 1 1 moves have been made, in the course of which the players have exchanged two pairs of minor pieces; but already Black's camp has a characteristic peculiarity, namely the position of his pawn on e4. Sooner or later Black will clearly have to defend this pawn with ... f5. After that, however, his centre will easily prove vulnerable - White will be able to attack it with f2-f3. Thus, the general direction of the play may already be viewed as laid down; the strategic plan is clear. What remains is the correct tactical implementation of it, after suitable preparation.

White's exploitation of the weakness of Black's e4-pawn gradually grew into a crushing attack. The wins for White in the examples we have looked at were the result of play that was well thought out, planned and technically correct.
2. RELATIVE STRENGTHS OF THE PIECES
In Position 8 1 , White wins by exchanging pieces. There are some difficulties for the beginner in the fact that White gives up a stronger piece (a rook) for a weaker one (a bishop), even though he is winning some pawns in the same process. How do we determine whether or not an exchange is favourable? Naturally, with an exchange of pieces of the same type (bishop for bishop, pawn for pawn, and so forth) we are losing no material and the forces remain equal. On the other hand if pieces of differing types are involved in the exchange, we have to be acquainted with their relative strengths. The strength of a piece is determined by its mobility in open space, in other words by its degree of influence on the squares (or lines) of the chessboard. Since mobility depends on a way of moving which always remains the same, the absolute strength of a piece undergoes comparatively little change (we would only recall the greater mobility of pieces in the centre of the board as opposed to the edge). But during a game the chessboard is not empty. The mobility of a piece is influenced by the arrangement of other pieces on the board. The position of an individual piece can also be favourable or unfavourable for attaining the aims we are setting ourselves. Hence what is important to us is only the relative strength of the pieces - their strength in relation to each other in each particular situation. It is here that the fluctuations can be considerable. Based on experience from an immense number of games played, the average relative strength of the pieces has been more or less accurately established. This scheme of values is useful to memorize. The gradual accumulation of experience will permit a player to cope with this issue more independently. The pawn is taken as the unit of strength. The bishop is considered equal to the knight, and each of the minor pieces is held to be worth 3Y2 pawns (that is, a little stronger than three pawns but weaker than four). A rook and two pawns are equal to two minor pieces, and a minor piece Chapter 3 - Tactics and Strategy 6 1 plus 1 Y2 pawns is the equivalent o f a rook. From this i t follows (purely arithmetically) that a rook is equal to five pawns. The queen is considered equal in strength to two rooks or to three minor pieces, or sometimes also to a rook plus bishop and pawn. The king has approximately the strength of a minor piece (three units on the conventional scale). If for the moment we ignore the factor of how the pieces are arranged and approach the matter arithmetically, we conclude that an exchange of pieces (that is, a simplification of the game) always favours the stronger side. Suppose that in some position White's forces count for twenty units and Black's for ten. White is twice as strong. But after an exchange of (say) five units, the ratio of forces will be 1 5:5, in other words White will be not just twice (20: 1 0) but three times as strong. Now let us come back to our example number 8 1 . From an easy count, we see that the ratio of forces before the exchange was 1 0:9'12, in other words White was stronger by a factor of 1 . 1 . The exchange was to White's profit - in return for five units, he obtained 6.5. Following the exchange, the ratio of forces was 5:3, so White was stronger by a factor of 1 .7 (compared with 1 . 1 before) - largely thanks to the mere fact of simplification, quite apart from the material gain from the deal. Such computations - of who is stronger by how much - are not to be carried out in practical play; we are just presenting them for greater clarity of explanation. Applying this same scheme of relative strengths, we can ascertain that in Position 84 it doesn't pay White to give up two minor pieces for a rook and pawn (l .lL'lxf7 E:x£7 2.hf'lt Wx£7).
[diagram]
For full material equality, White would have to win one pawn more. Whether even that would benefit him for the further course of the game is another question that would have to be decided in each individual case. It must once again be emphasized that the relative strengths of the pieces in the scheme we have demonstrated are very approximate. Everything depends on the position. If this scheme remains more or less valid in the opening and middlegame, it may prove downright spurious in the endgame when as the result of exchanges there are hardly any pieces left on the board.
62 The Soviet Chess Primer
In the endgame the mobility of the pieces increases of course, but then the value of the pawns (the basic unit of measurement!} often rises incomparably faster as they advance and their chances of queening improve. It is by no means always possible to avoid losing, for instance, with a minor piece against three connected pawns or a rook against four, not to speak of the exceptional cases where just one or rwo pawns may win. You should make a study of examples in which some peculiarities of the piece configuration upset the normal balance of strength of the remaining material. The play is then apt to take an unexpected turn.
3. HOW THE POSITION AFFECTS THE RELATIVE STRENGTHS
The queen, as a rule, wins easily against a few pawns. Yet in can happen that one single pawn, when close to its promotion square, requires serious measures to deal with it.

This check is crucial. 4 ...�dl Black's king is forced to occupy the promotion square, impeding his own pawn and granting White the opportunity to bring his king up. White, as we say, has gained a tempo - he has gained time for a useful move. Chapter 3 - Tactics and Strategy 63

2.\Mfdl t @g2 3.1Mfe2t @gl Now the white king
approaches decisively. 4.@f4 h l =W 5.@g3! Threatening mate on f2 or on the first rank, against which there is no defence. Returning again to Diagram 86, an interesting position arises if we transfer White's king to h7 and his queen to e5. After l .Rg7t, Black can draw as before by playing l ...@fl or L..c;;t> £2, only not by L..c;;t> h l ?, which is met by 2.c;;t> g6! c;;t> g2 3.@f5t, and having brought his king two squares closer by means of the discovered check, White wins in the way we just demonstrated. In Position 87, Black can draw as follows: l.�g4t @h2 2.�f3 @gl 3.�g3t Now Black unexpectedly plays, not 3 ...@fl , but: 3 ...@hl! IfWhite captures on f2, this gives stalemate. In Examples 86 and 87 White doesn't succeed in bringing his king up, and in spite of his huge material advantage he has to settle for a draw. The peculiarities of the position, as we can see, serve to level out the strength of a queen and a pawn.
[diagram]
In this posltlon a bishop, with waiting moves between al, b2 and c3 at its disposal, draws against two rooks. If Black moves his rook from d8 to any square on the 8th rank or makes a king move, White plays t.xd4, and with one rook Black is unable, in general terms, to win against a bishop (see Position 27 on page 26). This example shows just how important the pinning of a piece (in this case the rook on d4) can be. We now turn to some examples of greater practical significance. 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 Lolli, 1763
[diagram]
White wins, whichever side is to move Chapter 3 - Tactics and Strategy 65 A queen usually wins against a rook. In Position 89, if it is Black to move, he cannot play l ...�h3 owing to 2.'\Wfl , when the pinned rook perishes. Also l ...l'l:gl fails to
2.WI'h4#.
Consequently the rook is forced to move away from the king - and deprived of protection, it quickly succumbs. For example: (a) l ...l'l:g7 2.Wfe5t with simultaneous attack on the rook. (b) l ...l'l:g8 2.WI'e5t �hl 3.WI'alt �h2
4.WI'a2t, and the rook is lost.
(c) l . ..l'l:a2 2.WI'e5t c.t>gl 3.WI'd4t c.t>hl
4.Wfh8t c.t>gl (4. ..
l'l:h2 5.'\Wal#) 5.WI'g8t and again White wins the rook. Thus whatever move Black makes, he quickly loses his rook after a series of checks. If it is White's move in Diagram 89, he obviously needs to reach the same position with Black to move - after which the win is simple. This is achieved in three moves: I.'i!Ye5t c;!?hi If l ...�h3 then 2.WI'h5#. 2. 'l!Y al t c;!? h2 Not 2 ... l'l:gl 3.WI'h8#.
3.'l!Yel!
The goal is attained. What is the rationale of this manoeuvre? In Position 89 it was White to move, but by executing a three-move manoeuvre he handed the move over to his opponent. Essentially, he lost a move. And yet a chessplayer will say that White gained a tempo - he gained the time necessary to achieve the aim he had in mind. Such cases of handing the move over are often encountered in games, and we shall have more to say about them later. 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 Ponziani, 1782
[diagram]
Black to move draws In Diagram 90 the forces are the same as in Diagram 89, but their arrangement is different. It turns out that if it is Black to move here, he can draw by giving perpetual check on the h-, g- and f-files. The white king cannot go to the e-file on account of ... l'l:e7, winning the queen. If the king works its way, in the face of the checks, as far as h6, Black still plays ... l'l:h7t, as �xh7 gives stalemate. If the king goes to f6, the reply is ... l'l:g6t, and with �xg6 Black is again stalemated. The draw is made possible here by the unfortunate position of the queen on e6. The queen has acted prematurely to cramp the black king's mobility before White's own king has arrived on the scene. If it is White to play from the diagram, he wins easily by first removing his queen (for instance, l .WI'd6t �e8) and then bringing his king up (via h6).
66 The Soviet Chess Primer
[diagram]
Black cannot avoid loss A rook is incontestably stronger than a pawn, yet in Position 9 1 Black loses because the pawn on f7 cannot be stopped. L.J�g2t v;t>n Black has no more checks to delay the pawn's promotion. On obtaining a queen, White will win as in Position 89. 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1
[diagram]
White to play and win The position in Diagram 92 is a little more complex. Black has a bishop for two pawns. The white pawns cannot advance - their path is blocked. However, White plays: IJ1xf6! gxf6 v;t>gs This move was previously prevented by the bishop. Now, when Black's advantage might seem even greater than before (not just a bishop but a rook for the two pawns), White wins easily by advancing both pawns and obtaining a queen. The examples we have examined show that the true correlation of forces depends not only on the material but on the position. At the same time it must not be forgotten that these examples are merely rare exceptions which by no means overturn the solidly established opinion of practical chessplayers concerning the average relative strengths of the pieces (see page 60). The important thing to understand is that the relative value of the pieces must not be our sole guide; we must also take account of what role the pieces are playing, what work they are doing in this or that position. To conclude, let us discuss the relative value of bishop and knight. Beginners often seek to exchange off their opponents' knights by any available means, as they experience some trepidation in the face of a knight's unexpected forays. This is quite wrong. There is nothing unexpected if we carefully consider what squares an enemy knight can move to, what threats it can create when occupying these squares, and what our moves will be in reply. Generally speaking, the bishop and the knight are of equal worth. The bishop, to be sure, has more mobility than the knight, but only the squares of one colour are accessible to it, whereas the knight changes the colour Chapter 3 - Tactics and Strategy 67 of its square with every move. If the position is of the closed type, that is if the bishop's lines of action (the diagonals) are blocked by immobile pawns, then the bishop's long-range fighting power diminishes and the knight may prove more useful. If however the lines are open and the players have to contend with pawns advancing, then the advantage is rather with the bishop. Two bishops are often stronger than two knights or a bishop and knight, since while retaining the advantage of greater mobility they control all the squares of the board between them. Depending on the position, sometimes one minor piece proves stronger, sometimes the other does. Let's look at the following examples. 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1

Once his king is on that square, the white pawns will quickly fall. However, if in Position 93 we transfer the white king c3, the black knight to e7 and the white bishop to f3, then Black can no longer win. The light-squared bishop in this (new) position is no longer playing the passive role of defending White's pawns like the bishop in the diagram, but acquires the possibility of attacking the pawns on the black side.

How, then, will Black defend after the bishop moves? The rook on h2 will capture on c2, then Black will stop the a-pawn with ...�a2 and start pushing his own c-pawn. This being so, can't we utilize our bishop's power of obstruction to make it harder for the rook to get to a2? By now the first move is clear: I..ifl!

70 The Soviet Chess Primer
In the above example we may also note the following. At first, each move with the bishop deprived the rook of some square on the a-file but at the same time released some other square, allowing the rook to aim at h 1 , h3 and h5 in succession - until the bishop took up the crucial post on c3 and all squares on the a-file were cut off. We can very often observe positive and negative points combined in one move. Acquiring scope for action from its new square, a piece loses the influence it was exerting from its previous one. You need to keep a sharp eye on all these factors and clearly deduce what aim each move is pursuing and what action it performs.
5. RESTRICTIONS ON MOBILITY
A chess piece has to be active, it has to perform operations - attacking, confining the enemy units, winning them. A piece has to be mobile. Any restriction on its mobility lessens its power, making it weak - as a result of which it sometimes becomes a target for the enemy to attack. Let us see what the circumstances are in which mobility is restricted. The cases arise from a fair number of reasons, and a close study of all of them is essential.
OBSTRUCTION
The mobility of a piece is restricted by other pieces, by reason of the lines they obstruct and the squares they take up. For a vivid illustration of how much the obstructing potential of the pieces influences mobility, recall the starting position of the game (Diagram 1 on page 1 4), in which the lines of action of the bishops, queens and rooks are completely blocked. Pieces also play the role of blockaders later in the game. Let us examine some examples. Alekhine - Colle, Paris 1 925

White to move I.'ilYxd7!! gxd7 2.gest �h7 3J;cc8 Black resigned. The situation is tragi-comic: 3 ... �h6 is useless, since the g5-square is blocked by Black's own queen; and for this same reason ...g5 (to escape with the king to g6) is impossible. 1-0 Obstructions lead to cramped posltlons in which, as a rule, the power of the pieces cannot be utilized for either attack or defence. You therefore need to think about open lines to ensure freedom of action for your pieces. A restriction on the enemy king's mobility is often achieved by the attacking side in order to bring about mate. Chapter 3 - Tactics and Strategy Atkins - Gibson, Southport 1 924 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 a c e g h White mates in 2 moves l.'l'gSt! Black's reply is forced: l.. .llxg82.�f7# An example of smothered mate.

Various types of obstruction, as well as the possibility of opening lines for himself, were finely exploited by White in the following game. Chigorin - Davydov, St Petersburg 1 874

CUTTING SQUARES OFF
The mobility of a piece is restricted when the squares to which it could move are under attack. An anc104 ient puzzle

Wherever it goes, White captures it, and there follows: 2 ... .Ba2 3.t!xc2# 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1
[diagram]
In Position 1 04, a knight deprived a bishop of all the squares it could move to. This is quite a rare case. It was made possible by the fact that one of the bishop's diagonals was obstructed by a pawn of its own colour. As Diagram 1 05 shows, it is much easier for a bishop to deal with the task of taking squares away from a knight. Restrictions on the mobility of pieces through the inaccesibilty of squares and the blocking of paths - are a factor that plays an immense role in any game of chess. Sometimes it brings about a catastrophe, as for example in the following position. 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 Keres - Kotov, Parnu 1 947

EDGE OF THE BOARD
When a piece is far from the centre of the board - on or near an edge file or rank - this significantly affects its mobility. In the starting position of the game, for instance - and even after a few pawn moves - the mobility of the pieces is very small. To enable them to act effectively, they are brought closer to the centre - they are "developed". Quite often, pieces at the side of the board, cut off from their base, will quickly meet their doom.

4.�e2
The knight perishes. In practice, when a king is checkmated, this nearly always occurs on one of the edges (see Diagrams 32-50), as the king's mobility here is minimal. Hence the basic principle for bringing about mate in the simplest endgames is to drive the enemy king gradually towards the side of the board, and sometimes even into the corner. When mobility is curtailed by the edge of the board, this often combines with other factors: the cutting-off of squares, and obstructions to the pieces' lines of action. In the following example, White exploits a situation where the mobility of Black's king is cramped by his own pieces. 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1

DEFENSIVE PIECE
The mobility of a piece is limited when it is occupied with the defence of another piece or of some important point. In many such cases, the diversion or capture of the defender proves decisive. Chapter 3 - Tactics and Strategy 75 109 1 10 In Position 1 09 the bishop on f8 is defending the point g7, preventing the advance of the g6- pawn. White wins by: t..le7 Diverting the defending piece from the f8-h6 diagonal.

As an example, consider the following game: l.e4 e5 2 . .tc4 d6 3.�f3 �c6 4.�c3 .tg4

INSUFFICIENT TIME
Time plays a major role in chess. The unit of time is the move, which in one way or another alters the arrangement of the pieces on the board. If we leave castling aside, each move is capable of altering the position of one piece only; the other pieces are forced to remain immobile at the moment when the move is carried out. Hence mobility in chess may be limited by a lack of time in which to move this or that piece. To clarify this, we may take an example that was given earlier - Position 85 on page 62. In that example the pawn on d2 could not at any moment move to dl and be queened, since White was constantly forcing Black to move his king, leaving him no time (no move) in which to promote the pawn. We may say that in this way the pawn was deprived of mobility. Let us look at another example. 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 From a game by A. Neyman (White)
[diagram]
White to move draws Black has an extra piece and a strong position too: he threatens mate on g2, and the knight on d7 is under attack.

By forcing Black to move his king continually, White condemns to inactivity the h1/zo-stile pieces that are a danger to him. lh In this ancient position, there is also another interesting possibility for perpetual check: I .%Vh7t ltlxh7 ( l . ..�xh7 2.ltlf8t <;t>h8

Considering that whenever any piece moves the others remain immobile and often idle, players avoid making several moves in succession with the same piece in the opening phase of the game. Time (moves) must be used economically - more pieces must be brought into the fight in the smallest number of moves. If you neglect this rule, you will be left with many pieces bunched together on their starting squares. At the crucial moment there will no time to activate them and enable them to repel your opponent's pressure. A lack of time also comes into play when two pieces are threatened at once. In most cases it is only possible for one piece to be moved away or defended, while the other succumbs to the attack. In speaking of difficulties associated with a lack of time, we are essentially moving on to our next subject: the enhanced activity of the pieces resulting from so-called "forcing" moves which create various threats.
82 The Soviet Chess Primer
6. FORCING MOVES 126
The term "forcing" is applied to moves of particular power that compel the opponent to attend to them before anything else, on account of the dangers (threats) they create. An example of a threat is an attack on the king (a check, a threat of mate). A player may also be threatening to win material or to occupy a square that in some respect is important. Generally, the danger to the opponent cannot be met by a nondescript move. To most forcing moves, the playable replies are specific and limited in number; often only a single move will do.
CHECK
If your king is placed in check, your choice of moves in reply is small. Move the king out of check; shield the king with some piece or other, using that piece's blocking ability; or capture the checking piece. There are no other options. Parrying a check sometimes brings adverse consequences. Thus for example, moving the king to an adjacent square may involve it in new dangers. Shielding the king with a piece, as we know already, means that that piece is pinned, which again can be very dangerous. Subconsciously feeling its power, a beginner will never miss giving a check if only he gets the chance. Isn't it pleasant to be in control of the events on the board! And the king of course is the chief enemy that has to be annihilated! But a check that is unconnected with the further course of the play is often as harmless as a blank cartridge. Sometimes it can even harm your own cause, if for instance the check drives the king onto a better square, or if your own piece, after giving the check, is in a bad position. Check is a powerful tactical device if forming an integral part of the right manoeuvre.

�U6 52.gg8t! <i!>xg8 53.'ee8t <i!>g7 54.'eh8t <i!>:xhs Stalemate! White sacrificed all his pieces with continuous checks. lf2-lf2 One instance of a continuous sequence of checks is perpetual check - this is when the weaker side constantly attacks the king to rescue itself from the threat of loss (see Diagram 1 25 on page 8 1 ) . Very often the purpose o f a series of checks is to bring a piece into a crucial position without giving your opponent the time for any defensive moves. A. Troitsky, 1 930

A mating net has been created from which Black cannot escape. (White threatens to give mate on h7, or on g7 if the black queen moves away. Black has no checks.) In this example White succeeded in bringing his queen straight across, so to speak, from a8 to d7, by means of a series of checks. An even more powerful effect is produced by a double check - a variety of discovered check (see the commentary on Diagram 17 on page 22). The only defence against a double check is an escape move with the king. Chapter 3 - Tactics and Strategy 85 A. White, 1 9 1 9 Fun exercise

Another variety can arise when the piece that moves away attacks an enemy piece other than the king. This produces a simultaneous attack, all the more dangerous since the king is one of the attacked pieces. Simultaneous attacks are what we shall examine next.
DUAL ATTACK
The simultaneous attack on a number of pieces - usually two of them (hence the term "dual attack") - is among the most dangerous of moves, and has decided the fate of many a game of chess. A dual attack may be carried out by any piece in the appropriate circumstances. Of course the most varied forms of attack are performed by the queen, since the move of this piece amalgamates the moves of all the others except the knight.
86 The Soviet Chess Primer
Here are some typical examples of dual attacks of varied kinds, carried out by various pieces. In Position 1 36, the knight simultaneously attacks the king and queen. 8 7 6 The king's attack on the minor pieces in Position 1 37 differs from Position 135 in that the knight, this time, is defending the bishop. If Black can defend the knight, he saves his piece. 8 7 6 Chapter 3 - Tactics and Strategy 87 When one piece directly attacks enemy pieces in different directions, as in all the Examples 1 35- 142, this is called a "fork''. The characteristic device of winning a piece by a pawn fork was seen in the following game. 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 S. Belavenets - N.N., 1 936

If the attacked pieces are the other way round, with the king (or the more valuable piece) "in front" and an undefended piece behind it, the latter inevitably succumbs. This is called a skewer. Diagram 149 shows a typical case where a player wins a rook on the 7th rank by means of a skewer. Naturally, a simultaneous attack may aim not only at pieces but also at some points (squares on the board) which for some reason it is crucially important to occupy. 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 Chigorin - Janowski, Paris 1 900

Such a manoeuvre (with its distinctive to-and-fro movements of the rook along the rank or file) is called a "mill" by Russian players; here we saw White "grinding" his opponent's entire queenside . The power of dual attacks is so great that defending against them involves extreme difficulty; at any rate, the defence has to be based on equally sharp moves in reply. In Position 1 29 (on page 83), for example, White was able to save himself thanks to a forcing move - namely a check (one of his pieces moved away with an attack on a piece of greater value). The threat has to be answered by a counter-threat, as the following example shows.

CAPTURES
The capture of a piece is also a forcing move, for in most cases it compels the other side to continue in only one way - with a recapture. Sometimes a capture can also be answered by a dual attack or by some other forcing move, but usually this will still have the same purpose of recovering the piece, as otherwise the game may be lost as a result of the opponent's material plus. If a capture involves giving up one piece in return for a weaker one, this is called a sacrifice, just as when a piece is surrendered outright. In either case we are deliberately losing some material for the sake of obtaining an advantage in position. The aims pursued by sacrifices are of the most varied kinds; in this chapter we shall have the chance to acquaint ourselves with some of them. If we are giving up a piece equal in value to the one captured, this is an exchange. What is achieved by an exchange? What aim can it pursue? An exchange with the straightforward aim of reducing the material or, as we say, simplifying the position, was already seen at the start of this chapter. As a rule, such simplification favours the stronger side. When exchanging it is very important not to allow a deterioration of your own position, especially your pawn formation - since defects in the pawn structure tend to be irreparable. 158a Chapter 3 - Tactics and Strategy 93 In Position 1 58, if Black allows the exchange of his knight, he is left with a disrupted pawn formation {see Diagram 1 58a). The pawns on f6 and f7 are doubled, which reduces their mobility; deprived of protection from other pawns, they are weak. Apart from the damage to the pawn position, the exchange has opened up the g-file against the black king, possibly putting it in great danger. The h6-square has also become accessible to the white pieces. Nimzowitsch - Jacobsen, Copenhagen 1 923

[diagram]
White to move We already know that the diversion or elimination of a defending piece is often decisive. For instance in Position 162, White has an exchange:

White to move Chapter 3 - Tactics and Strategy 95 In Position 1 64, the rook has attacked the bishop and knight simultaneously. White is rescued from this dual attack by exchanging with: l.b6 He has now captured a piece and can therefore give up one of his own; he will then be able to move or defend his second piece. The gain of time here is obvious - exactly as in Example 1 29 (on page 83).

3.he8t
If this move didn't give check it would be useless, and in defending against ...Ba7 White would lose his bishop on b5. In practical play, exchanges for the purpose of gaining time can be encountered right from the very first moves. For example:
1.e4 d5 2.exd5 Yfxd5
96 The Soviet Chess Primer
White now brings out a piece with:
3.t!Jc3
Attacking the queen at the same time and forcing it to withdraw, that is, to make a second move. After the queen's move White develops a new piece, thus drawing ahead of his opponent in the number of pieces brought into battle. Another example: l.e4 e5 2.d4 d6 3.dxe5 dxe5 4JWxd8t 'i!?xd8 Black has been deprived of the right to castle. As a result, White will bring his pieces (especially the rooks) into play more quickly than his opponent and will obtain better chances in the coming fight. Such are some of the aims that are pursued through exchanges. In other cases, players will seek exchanges in order to give the position a particular character (open or closed); or to achieve the desired relation of fighting forces (such as knight against bishop, or the opposite - which may confer the advantage of the bishop pair); or to gain control of squares of one colour; and so forth. These cases are more complex, and we will not dwell on them at this stage.
PAWN PROMOTION
The promotion of a pawn to a piece (usually a queen) is a special form of material gain. Usually it alters the balance of forces so greatly that players will often resign a game, acknowledging the uselessness of fighting on, if they recognize that they have no way of stopping a passed pawn. In view of this, the advance of a passed pawn, or sometimes even the mere threat of creating such a pawn, amounts to a sharp, forcing continuation. Chekhover - I. Rabinovich, Leningrad 1 934
[diagram]
Black to move In this position, Black won a pawn with an unexpected move: 46 ... t!Jxb3! The reply 47.axb3 would be bad on account of 47 ...a3, after which one of Black's pawns will queen.

The examples we have examined show what great significance a passed pawn has. To advance your passed pawn you have to choose the appropriate moment, when your opponent cannot stop the pawn or win it. Sometimes the advance is carried out for the purpose of diverting enemy pieces.
THREATS
Inasmuch as a capture is a forcing move, it's easy to understand that even a simple attack, in other words the mere threat of a capture, can sometimes be a forcing move too, as it leaves the opponent with the choice between only a small number of defensive moves. For instance when a pawn attacks a piece, as indeed when any piece of lesser value attacks one of greater value, this nearly always causes the more valuable piece to move, and the number of suitable squares where it can go may be very limited. Naturally other threats also arise in a game, not just threats to capture material. You can threaten to occupy an important square, to mate the enemy king, to promote a pawn, and so forth. Threats like this of course require your opponent to defend against them. However, an isolated threat, so dear to beginners, very often yields little. We attack a piece and it moves away, perhaps even attacking a piece of our own; we threaten mate in one move, but our opponent is playing attentively and parries this threat with ease. It's a different matter when a number of threats combine with each other or immediately follow one another. L. Kubbel, 1922
[diagram]
White wins Chapter 3 - Tactics and Strategy 99 In Position 172 for example, the black pawn on a3 is threatening to queen, and White would seem to have no way to prevent this. Yet he starts operating with a whole series of threats, of which the significance soon becomes clear. l.�c6! �xc6 Black takes the knight, seeing that 1 ... a2 would be met by the dual attack 2.ltlb4t (a threat!). There is no use in 1 ...\!?c4 either, on account of 2.ltlxd4. Then if 2 ... \!?xd4, White plays 3.Bf6t, gaining control of the pawn's promotion square; or if 2 ... a2, then 3.ltlb3. 2 . .tf6 �d5 White was threatening to take the d4-pawn, so Black defends it. He couldn't play 2 ... \!?c5 because of 3.Be7t, winning the pawn on a3.
3.d3! a2
To White's move, which looks incom prehensible, Black replies by pushing his pawn towards its queening square. But White has been preparing a fine manoeuvre.
4.c4t �c5
Of course 4 ...dxc3 would be bad in view of 5.Bxc3, when the a2-pawn is stopped. Black's 4 ... \!?c5 seems wholly natural. Yet an unexpected denouement follows.
5.�b7!
Now 5 ...a 1 =Wi will be met by 6.Be7#. With such a small quantity of pieces on the board, it would have been hard to suspect that this final threat was available - but it proves decisive. Black is compelled to move his king, whereupon 6.Bxd4 stops the pawn, and White easily wins. Of course, this example comes nowhere near to exhausting the immense variety of threats. We have come across many types of threat already, and we shall meet with still more of them later. The very essence of any game of chess is the creating and parrying of threats of every kind. At this stage it was merely important to note that threats are forcing moves, restricting the opponent to a small number of defensive continuations.
7. SERIES OF MOVES WITH A
COMMON IDEA
Up to here we have acquainted ourselves chiefly with the aims and effect of individual moves. We now proceed to look at how separate moves are associated or combined - in other words, we shall be examining sequences of moves which are in some way joined in a single whole. What binds a series of moves into a single whole is a common idea - a plan. In Position 1 32 (on page 84), for example, we saw a series of moves (checks) that culminated in mate. That was what constituted the purpose of the sequence; each of the checks occurred as part of the common plan. In another case such as Position 172 (the study by Kubbel), a continuous sequence of threats from White pursued the aim of stopping the enemy pawn from queening; again a common plan united all these moves. Moves by White and Black combined in a continuous unbroken sequence are called a variation. If one of the players employs forcing moves - to which the playable replies are specific and few in number, and sometimes limited to one move only - then a forced variation comes about. Such forced variations are termed combinations when they involve sacrifices from which the player counts on deriving some benefit or other. We have already come across numerous combinations in this book, and a separate chapter will be devoted to them later on. 1 00 The Soviet Chess Primer But whether or not the variations are forced and a combination is possible, moves are always connected by an overall idea, a plan. The substance of such plans, notwithstanding their immense diversity, can ultimately be divided into two basic categories: (I) We are either trying to achieve the final aim of a chess game - to checkmate the enemy - by direct means (that is by concentrating our pieces against the king, by attacking it and creating mate threats); or (2) We are trying reach our goal by an indirect route, which first involves weakening our opponent by winning material from him or by gaining positional advantages, in other words an arrangement of the pieces that favours us better. There is also one other category of plans that applies when we are in trouble, when we are thinking about defence rather than attack, and about somehow saving ourselves from impending defeat. We shall discuss this in more detail later. All strategic plans are covered (in the most general sense, of course) by what has just been said. In a practical game of chess, however, such excessively broad and general plans are insufficient. There is usually a constant need to solve a number of simpler strategic tasks and to move gradually, step by step, towards the ultimate goal. The small-scale strategic ideas and plans that this involves are extremely numerous. There is an even greater quantity of tactical ideas and devices which help us to solve the specific and general strategic tasks.
PIECE COORDINATION
Positions 1 68, 172 and many others that we have examined offer good examples of coordinated play with the pieces, without which there can be no good results. This is one of the most important principles of the game. When a beginner stops just playing with this or that piece individually and starts combining their activities in his manoeuvres (even with only two or three pieces at once), this is the best sign that he is making progress. In some cases, achieving coordinated play with the pieces is very hard. Difficulties can arise even in simple endgames - such as when you need to drive your opponent's king to the side of the board or into the corner, using your united forces, in order to mate him. Mating with bishop and knight can serve as an example of such difficulties, and for the moment we will confine ourselves to this special example. Throughout this book, there are abundant examples of concerted piece play; essentially, not a single chess game is devoid of it. The bishop-and-knight mate presents some problems even to experienced chessplayers. There are positions in which the mate is not to be achieved in under 34 moves. The trouble is that you have to coordinate the actions of all three white pieces in a highly skilful manner in order to drive the enemy king into one of the corners accessible to the bishop - since checkmate cannot be forced in the other corners. The king that is being pursued will always try to remain in the centre of the board, but when compelled to withdraw, it will head towards the "wrong" coloured corner (where the bishop's action does not reach). It is only after this that the attacker begins a systematic process of driving the king to the opposite corner where it will be mated. To master this endgame, you must first of all learn to solve some simple exercises of the following type. Chapter 3 - Tactics and Strategy 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1

For greater clarity and easier memorization, we have preferred a longer method which keeps to a uniform device for driving the king in the required direction.) on the lines of Position 177.
3.�e6 �c7
It now looks as if the black king is slipping out of the net. However, with his next two moves White sets up an impenetrable barrier along the a7-gl and a6-fl diagonals. (Basically this is the crucial and most difficult moment in the bishop-and-knight endgame.) Chapter 3 - Tactics and Strategy 103
4.tlld7! �c6 5.i.d3!
Black cannot break through this cordon (the knight is covering the dark squares b6 and c5, while the bishop covers the light squares b5 and a6); he has to retreat, permitting the gradual approach of the white king. The net around Black's king is drawn tighter, and his remaining moves essentially amount to a helpless wait for his doom. For example: a) 5 .. .Cllc7 6.i.e4 �c8 7.�d6 �d8 8.i.g6 �c8 9.tLlc5 �d8 1 0.tLlb7t �c8 1 l .�c6 �b8 1 2.�b6 and so on, much as in Position 177. b) 5 ...�b7 6.�d6 �c8 7.tLlc5 �b8 (Bf7 ...�d8, then 8.i.b5 and 9.Bd7t) 8.�d7 �a7 9.�c7 �a8 I O.�b6 �b8 1 I .i.a6 and mate in two moves, as in Position 176. It remains for us to see how to force the enemy king into the "starting position" for this process (Diagram 179). As a preliminary we should note that for constricting the king, the following arrangements of the pieces are important:
[diagram]
Given a set-up with the minor pieces co ordinated (that is, in harmony with each other) as in Positions 180 and 1 8 1 , Black is shut off from three or four squares on a particular rank or file - which thus becomes inaccessible to him. We now turn to a practical example that reveals the typical devices for driving the king back.
[diagram]
In this position, the play may go as follows: I.tllf3 Arranging the pieces on the pattern of Diagram 1 8 1 . 1 04 The Soviet Chess Primer l • • • i>f7 2.i>e5 i>g7 3.�g5 183 Now there are three variations: a) 3 • • • i>gs 4. c.i>£6 c.i>£8 5.ft�f7 i>es 6 • .tf5 i>£8, and White has reached Position 179. b) 3 • • • i>f8 4.i>e6! i>g7 (or 4 ...me8 5.liJf7) s.i>e7 i>gs 6.c.i>f6, as above. c) 3 • • • i>h6 4.i>f6 i>hS 5 • .Be2t i>h4 (on 5 .. .'�h6, White reaches Position 1 79 by 6.liJf7t �h7 7 . .Bd3t �g8 8 . .Bf5 �f8) 6.tlle4!

In its configuration of minor pieces, the final mating position recalls Diagram 1 80. The patterns of Diagrams 1 80 and 1 8 1 , when applied at the edge of the board and with the support of the white king, constitute the basic mating schemes (see the mating positions that result from Diagrams 1 73 and 174). We can now see that in the "mate with bishop and knight" endgame, there is nothing that is difficult to understand. After gaining some chess experience, you can come back to this endgame and examine it afresh so as to absorb it better.
ATTACKING THE UNPROTECTED
An insufficiently proKING tected king becomes easy prey for enemy pieces operating in harmony. The last remaining cover is often destroyed by a sacrifice. Botvinnik - Chekhover, Moscow 1935
[diagram]
White to move White has already sacrificed two pieces to weaken the black king's position. With his next sacrifice he eliminates one more defending piece and quickly brings the game to its denouement: 32J:txf6! .tx£6 33.�h7t i>£8 34J::t el Threatening Wfh8#. 34 •• . .Be5 35.�h8t i>e7 36.�xg7t i>d6

43.�bl#
Cases where similar attacks are carried out against an inadequately defended king are plentiful. Piece sacrifices that sweep away the last barriers are quite common. If you think about it, these sacrifices, far from weakening the attacker, give him a preponderance in the decisive battle sector, as they leave the defender with still fewer possibilities of defence. However, when sacrificing a piece it is essential to calculate all possible consequences precisely. Chapter 3 - Tactics and Strategy 105
CENTRALIZATION
The great mobility of pieces in the centre of the board and their restricted mobility at the edge compel us to acknowledge the special significance that the central squares have in the game, and the importance of occupying them with our pieces. Occupation of the centre, as we shall soon see from numerous examples, allows us to generate multiple threats against both the kingside and the queenside. In Diagrams 96, 1 5 5 and 1 59, strong and crucial positions in the centre are occupied by the knights (see also Position 1 85) . In Diagram 8 1 it is the white king that is occupying a very active position on d5. Generally speaking, in the endgame, when few pieces are left on the board and the king is threatened with no immediate danger, the king itself exerts a major influence on the further course of the play, and if it very quickly arrives in the centre, this is often of crucial importance. Rubinstein - Nimzowitsch, Carlsbad 1907
[diagram]
Black to move Black's advantage lies not only in his extra pawn (which is a passed pawn, too) on the a-file, but also in the fact that his king can occupy the centre more quickly. This soon compels White to lay down his arms. l../�?e7 2. �£2 �d6 3. �e3 �c5 White has not managed to reach the d4- square. With his king on that square facing the black king on d6, he could still have fought on.
4.g4 �b4 5.�d4 .Bb3 6.g5 a4
The advance of this pawn settles the outcome. ...0-1 Centralization is one of the cardinal principles of the game. You should constantly endeavour to control the centre and occupy it with your pawns and pieces, since this usually guarantees a lasting positional advantage. The eminent master Peter Romanovsky defined the centre figuratively as "the heights commanding the terrain". We shall discuss the importance of the centre in much more detail later on. CONQUEIDNG THE Sffiffi
NTH
(OR EIGHTH) RANK
If the geometry of the chessboard dictates that the central squares will have special significance for the game, the initial arrangement of the pieces on the first and second ranks (for White) or the seventh and eighth (for Black) suggests to us that these ranks will be exceptionally sensitive if the hostile major pieces - in particular the rooks - should invade them in the course of the struggle. Normally on the seventh rank there will always be some pawns remaining (not all pawns get moved), and the action of a rook that has invaded there may be compared figuratively to a raid by a tank in the enemy's rear. On the eighth rank there is the enemy king - another welcome object 1 06 The Soviet Chess Primer of attack - but as a rule, that rank (unlike the seventh) will be adequately defended by the opponent's own rooks. For this reason, a commoner strategic goal is the invasion of the seventh rank (or, conversely, the second - but for the sake of simplicity and uniformity, theory usually examines all questions from White's viewpoint) . Position 1 85 is a good illustration. Tarrasch, 1 93 1
[diagram]
White to move The board is crowded with pieces; the c-file alone is open. White occupies this file with his major pieces in order to penetrate to c7 if he can. It's true that all Black's pawns have managed to move off the 7th rank, but his minor pieces and king are located there. Let's follow how White accomplishes his plan, methodically, step by step. l.gacl gcs Black opposes the rook on c1 with his own rook, not conceding the file without a struggle.

(Concerted play with all the pieces!) In this connection we should note how the dark squares in Black's camp became weak after the exchange of his dark-squared bishop, making the action of White's bishop on the h4-d8 diagonal very powerful. 9 . .tfl �b6 This attempt to hinder the bishop's redeployment is hopeless, as even the continuation 1 0. .Bh4 �xd4t 1 U�h1 promises little for Black in view of the threat to capture on d8 and d7.

CONCENTRATING THE FORC�
AGAINST AN IMPORTANT POINT
In Position 8 1 we saw the white forces concentrated against a backward pawn. What made this possible was the immobility of the
108 The Soviet Chess Primer
pawn that White had selected as the object of his attack. It would be senseless to focus your strength on a mobile piece that could change its place at any moment. On precisely these grounds, you may concentrate your forces against a piece that is pinned and totally immobile, or against a defending piece whose mobility, as we know, is also restricted. 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1

In general the device of concentration is too simple and comprehensible to be worth discussing in more detail.
DRAWING AN ENEMY PIECE
TOWARDS OR AWAY FROM A SQUARE
The idea of diverting an enemy piece or of luring it onto a particular square would seem to be as old as chess itself. Damiano, 1 5 1 2
[diagram]
White to play and win In Position 1 89, the knight on c6 is keeping the pawn's promotion square under control. Therefore by diverting the black knight with: l.�d4t tllxd4 2.b8=� White settles the outcome of the game. Chapter 3 - Tactics and Strategy Lo 190 lli, 1763
[diagram]
White to play and win In Position 1 90, Black is threatening ...b 1 =Wf. White plays: 1Jlb5 Preventing the black pawn from queening and even preparing to eliminate it. Black's reply is forced. 1 ...�xb5 The king has been lured onto the fateful b-file.
2.b7 b1=YlY 3.b8=YlYt
White wins the queen with a skewer. A blend of both motifs (diverting a piece away from a square, and luring a piece onto a square) can be seen in our next two examples. G. Reichhelm, 1 900
[diagram]
White to play and win Under normal circumstances White wouldn't be able to move his king away from the connected pawns on g4 and h5, as they would be threatening to advance and queen. Here, however, it turns out that White can create an even stronger threat of his own. l.�f4 �b7 2.c5! Diverting the d6-pawn and thereby clearing the diagonal for encroaching further with his king (via e5 and d6). Black can't refuse to capture on c5, as the white pawn would immediately press on (3.c6t Ra8 4.c7 Wb?
5.a8=Wft Rxa8 6.c8=Wf#).
2 ...dxc5 3. �e5 g3 4. �d6 g2 The white king is already close enough to make the following combination possible:
5.a8=YlYt �xa8 6.�c7 g1=YlY 7.b7t �a7
8.b8=YlYt �a6 9.YlYb6#
Note that the mate on b6 is only possible because the pawn on c5 is blocking the black queen's diagonal. 1 1 0 The Soviet Chess Primer So the aim of the pawn sacrifice with 2.c5 was not only to divert the pawn from d6 and open the h2-b8 diagonal, but also to draw this pawn onto the c5-square in order to close a different diagonal: g 1 -a7.

And White wins. The ploy of enticing a piece onto a square may have the aim of limiting the opponent's mobility - for instance in order to bring about a smothered mate, as in Position 100 on page 7 1 . Attacks against defending pieces; forks; the opening and closing of lines; restricting the enemy pieces' mobility - all these are aims quite frequently pursued by the typical devices of drawing a piece away from or onto a specific square. In conclusion we will give one more example possessing some practical significance. 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1

EMPWYING MANY-SIDED THREATS
Many simple threats, such as attacks on a piece, will often present no danger, as the opponent will usually have equally simple means of defence. For that reason, the plan for a manoeuvre is sometimes based on combining various threats so that if the opponent does save himself from one of them, he will fall victim to another. A many-sided threat acts in a much more powerful way than a simple one, and if you manage to bring it about, it constitutes one of the most devastating devices. Chapter 3 - Tactics and Strategy I l l Levitsky - Freiman, Vilnius 1 9 1 2
[diagram]
White to move White could win the exchange with 27 . .Bxa5, but instead he selects:
27.�g5!
This should bring him greater gains. Indeed one threat is Wfxf7t, and another is b3-b4 - with a dual attack, seeing that the knight's departure from the 3rd rank has cleared that line for the rook on g3. To Black the latter threat seems the more serious, as he could be losing a rook. 27 ...b4 Shielding the rook on a5, blocking the pawn on b3 and even creating a dual attack against the white pieces on the 5th rank. This move appears better than 27 ... .Bxg5, for after
28.Wfxg5 Black would have to resign owing to
the dual attack on g7 and d8. However White has a strong reply:
28.ft'xf7t <i>h8 29.ft'xf6!!
Again creating a number of threats: mate on d8, or lDf7t followed by mate on g7; or if 29 ...gxf6, then 30.llJf7#. So Black resigned. 1-0 Here is one more example of a versatile threat. Levenfish - Riumin, Moscow 1 936

White to move In this position, White played 27.lDg3?. Yet he could have set up a decisive double threat:
27./t)f6t! gxf6 28.exf6
White threatens 29.Wfg3t with mate on g7, or 29.Wfxf8t and 30J'!d8#. Defending with any one move against both threats at once is impossible.
THE OPENING AND
BLOCKING OF LINES
The opening oflines for your pieces to increase their sphere of action is one of the most widespread measures. Position 1 85 offered a vivid example of the exploitation of an open c-file. A clearing of lines also occurred in a number ofother positions ( 1 0 1 , 144, 1 9 1) . We have also come across play which blocks the lines of the opponent's pieces (to restrict their activity) by creating various types of obstacle (see Position 98 and others). If we nonetheless 1 1 2 The Soviet Chess Primer return to this topic, we do so purely in order to point once again to the enormous significance of freedom of action for the pieces, and to emphasize the need for constant attention to the possibility of enhancing their fighting strength. 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 Chigorin - Pollock, New York 1 889
[diagram]
White to move White is a pawn down; in addition, his pawns on the 4th rank are under attack from the rook on c4. If White doesn't make use of the powerful placing of his pieces, his opponent may manage to gain the advantage. The basic task for White is to increase the active strength of his rooks (his other pieces are excellently placed). To this end he attacks his opponent in what might seem an impregnable place - e5 - and achieves the decisive opening of lines.

NG THROUGH THE
PAWN POSITION
If one of the opponents possesses a majority of pawns on the flank (for instance three pawns against two), then by gradually advancing and exchanging he can acquire a passed pawn (see Positions 26 1 and 262, which we discuss later). The matter is different when two complete chains of pawns are facing each other. Then a pawn can only become a passed pawn as the result of a breakthrough. Let us look at some characteristic examples. Chapter 3 - Tactics and Strategy 1 1 5

TEMPO GAIN AND ZUGZWANG
The moves of the players pursue various purposes which ultimately come down to winning the game, that is checkmating the enemy king, or else averting loss when things are going badly. A move is a player's exercise of his right to reposition a piece in order to come closer to the goal he has set himsel£ If a move doesn't fulfil this requirement, then it is bad or at best useless, and amounts to a loss of time - or, as chess players say, "the loss of a tempo". If our opponent has made a useless move, he has lost a tempo and we have gained one. We can gain a tempo by making a purposeful move in reply to our opponent's useless one. We have already seen an example of a gain of tempo in the opening, when Black was forced to withdraw an attacked piece, that is, move it a second time (see pages 95-6). This repeated move with one piece, which Black merely carried out to defend himself from the threat, was turned to account by White when he replied with a useful move, bringing a new piece into play. In Position 1 56 on page 9 1 (the "see-saw"), the repeated discovered checks compel Black to switch back and forth between two squares with his king, in a senseless manner (from the viewpoint of his own interests) . These lost tempos are exploited by White to win another piece or pawn with every move of his rook. In Position 89 (see page 64) we had a special case. With three successive queen moves White brought the position back to where it was before, only with Black to play instead of White. The explanation was precisely that if Black is to play from that position, White easily wins. Clearly White lost a move, but he gained a tempo because he came closer to his basic goal - which is the main thing. It thus emerges that you may gain a tempo by losing a move, that is, by handing the move to your opponent. From that last example we can see that the right to make a move is not always an advantage; it can sometimes be a heavy obligation.
[diagram]
Black to move In Position 206, under the obligation to make a move, the black king is forced to cede the square b7 to the white one, allowing the pawn to queen. Chapter 3 - Tactics and Strategy 1 1 7 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 206a
[diagram]
White to move White plays I.'i!?c7, forcing Black to move his bishop from a6, as there is nothing else he can move. Then 2 • .Bxb7# follows. As we know, the type of situation where the obligation to move brings adverse consequences is known as zugzwang (see Diagram 96 on page 68). The act of handing the move to the other player in order to gain a tempo is precisely what occurs in zugzwang situations.
[diagram]
White to move The move l .c6t fails to win here. Of course if Black made the mistake of l . ..bxc6, White could win with 2.'�c5 �d8! 3.�d6! (threatening b7) 3 ...�c8 4.�xc6 (fighting for the opposition as in Diagrams 69-80) . However, in answer to l .c6t? Black plays l .. .�c8! 2.�d6 �b8!. Now either 3.cxb7 or
3.c7t leads only to a draw.
It would be a different matter if Black were to move in the diagram position. Then the win would be possible, as Black would fall victim to zugzwang and would have to make way for the white king. The gain of a tempo (handing the move over to the opponent) is achieved in this case by a characteristic manoeuvre of the white king on the triangle of squares d5-d4-e5. Black's scope for manoeuvre is restricted by the inaccessibility of the c? -square and by the fact that he cannot go to the e-file (he needs to keep an eye on the b6-pawn, which might become passed). 1. 'it>e5 'i!?c6 Not l . ..'�e7, on account of 2.c6 bxc6 3.b7.
2.'i!?d4 'i!?d7 3.'it>d5

8.c6! bxc6
On 8 ...�b8 White plays 9.c7t, with mate to follow. 1 1 8 The Soviet Chess Primer
9.rJlc7 c5
White now gives mate in 3 moves, as in the solution to Position 1 9 1 . The present example is a good illustration of a distinctive ploy for gaining a tempo in situations of zugzwang. However, the ploy of handing the move over is a special case. More often you gain a tempo when your opponent makes moves that are no use to him, and sometimes he can be forced to do this - for instance as the result of a pin. Here are some typical examples. Pitschak - Foerder, Breslau 1930

COUNTERING THE OPPONENT'S PLANS
By numerous examples we have demonstrated certain tactical and strategic ideas which are more often encountered than others. Knowing about them makes it easier to devise a general or specific plan during play. Naturally, the entire wealth and vivid diversity of ideas inherent in the game of chess are not by any means exhausted by this fairly short list. Some themes will be elucidated in the pages that follow, and there is much that Chapter 3 - Tactics and Strategy 1 1 9 will later become comprehensible from the study of master games. The important thing is to absorb what you have been shown. The best way to do this is to try applying your hitherto fragile knowledge in practical play. If your first steps are unsuccessful, you must not of course let this trouble you. It must always be remembered that a game of chess is above all a struggle. We strive to accomplish our plans, but in so doing we are struggling with our opponent's moves and with his plans. Countering the opponent's plans is a fundamental rule of chess strategy. Nearly all the positions we have so far examined offer examples of this struggle. You might think that all this goes without saying. Yet in practice we quite often see cases where players obsessed with their own plans cease to take those of their opponents into account. And this has bad consequences. Maizelis, 1 92 1
[diagram]
White wins This position is from a tournament game, in which the continuation was 1 . 'kt>e6 Qc3 2. Qd6 Qd4 3.Qc6 IileS 4.Qb7 Qd6 5.Qxa7 Qc7. Here the players agreed a draw, as after 6.Qa8 IileS 7.a7 Qc7 White is stalemated. The players remained in the dark about the point of this endgame. With such scarce material, the possibility of a fight didn't even occur to them, and they played the concluding moves, so to speak, "as a matter of conscience". And yet even in this simple position it is possible to fight, and possible for White to win - as was first demonstrated in 1 92 1 by the author of this book. You can easily ascertain that Black has no defence other than the one he employed in the game (going towards the a6-pawn via b3 and b4 is useless) . White, however, can play differently. Whatever happens, he needs to spend five moves on crossing the board to capture the pawn on a7, but there is more than one route his king can take - along the seventh rank, or the sixth, or even by a third path. This third path is decisive, as it allows White to carry out his plan while at the same time hindering the black king's approach (via d4 and e5 to d6, etc.). The solution is:
1. <;!?e6! <;!?c3 2.
<;!?d5!! Black's whole system of defence collapses. He cannot now move to d4 and therefore loses a highly important tempo. Wherever the black king goes, White will play 3.'kt>c6 and then
4.Qb7, winning easily.
This kind of king march, with the seemingly incidental effect of barring the enemy king from a square it needs, is crucial to a number of endgames in which the issue is decided by manoeuvring with the kings. On concluding this chapter we proceed to "Techniques of Calculation" in chess, and then in the chapters on "Combination" and "Positional Play'' we shall extend our initial acquaintance with the foundations of chess tactics and strategy.

Elephant hunting episodes Thomas Mayne Reid, an author of adventure novels who was popular in his day, wrote about the habits of elephants and about elephant hunting. Although he knew a great deal on this subject, we can still fill in some gaps for him. (Readers of the English edition may be wondering why elephants are being discussed in a chess book! The point is that the piece named "bishop" in English is known as "elephant" in some other languages, including Russian, the language in which this book was originally published.)

It's too soon yet to be setting off for Mrica with the knowledge you have gained. Read the whole of this book first (you will find it contains some more of these fascinating hunting practices). Chapter 4 Techniques of Calculation From numerous examples in the foregoing chapter, we could ascertain how important it is to be able to calculate moves ahead correctly, to anticipate the further course and probable outcome of the struggle. Precise long-range calculation is not, however, possible in all cases, nor is it always needed. In any quiet position where everything is defended, where your pieces and those of your opponent have not come into close contact and there are no immediate threats, the players usually have the choice of a few moves of equal worth, which in turn can be answered in various ways that have no noticeable drawbacks. In this case an attempt to calculate moves ahead with precision would be futile. In such positions the choice of moves is determined by a general plan. In selecting this or that move, we consider what our piece will be capable of doing on its new square (by itself and in conjunction with our other pieces), and also what consequences may follow from abandoning the square it occupied before. It is a different matter in positions where sharp, forcing moves are possible. These positions only permit of a small number of replies, and if play continues with new forcing moves, the result is a continuous sequence that lends itself to exact calculation. It is in just this way that combinations take shape. This type of calculation requires a particular skill, the faculty of mentally visualizing and evaluating the positions that will arise. This skill and the art of correctly assessing chess positions are only gradually acquired. Here the only advice that can be given to any chessplayer is to educate and train his faculties of calculation properly. From the very outset you must train yourself to perform a calculation economically. For example, when considering two possible continuations, you should follow one of them through to the end, and then, after arriving at an assessment, proceed to examine the other line of play without returning to the first one. Having settled on one continuation, you should check it through (calculate it once more), but you shouldn't re-check all the alternative continuations. If you train yourself to work out the moves in such a manner all the time, this training will come in very useful later when playing with tournament clocks which limit your amount of time for thinking. This method also eliminates the unnecessary fatigue that often brings mistakes in its wake. 1 28 The Soviet Chess Primer In the process of calculating moves, however, what brings about a decision is not the calculation itself but the correct evaluation of the positions that can arise. An economical means of arriving at correct evaluations is just what we have in mind when we speak of techniques of calculation. Correct evaluation is a difficult matter. It is this, essentially, that constitutes the art of chess. To evaluate complex positions, extensive experience is needed. On the other hand, in many typical positions there are devices that make it very easy for you to carry out your deliberations - that is, to evaluate the position correctly (envisaging the ultimate outcome of the game) and to shape your play accordingly. Let us examine some of these simplified devices: 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1
1. THE RULE OF THE SQUARE
[diagram]
It is White to move. Can the black king stop the pawn if it starts advancing to queen? To answer this question, it would be rather tedious to start following in your head the two different paths of the king and pawn, to see how they match up. The problem can be solved more simply by other methods. The first method is an arithmetical one. You can count how many moves the pawn needs, and you can make a separate count of how many the king needs. The pawn on h3 can get to h7 in four moves; the black king needs the same number of moves to get to g7. Clearly the pawn advancing to queen will be stopped. The second method - the geometric one - allows you to solve the problem at once, from a single glance at the board. It will take the pawn on h3 five moves to reach its queening square (h8). From where the pawn stands, you count out that same number of squares in the direction of the enemy king (to the left), and trace an imaginary line as shown in Diagram 21 1 . This gives a geometric square which chessplayers call "the square of the pawn". If the opponent's king is inside this square, it can always stop the pawn, irrespective of who moves next. If the king is outside, we need to see whether it can enter the square if it is that player's turn to move. In Position 2 1 1 the king is already within the square. Consequently if the pawn tries to advance to queen, it will be stopped. Visualizing how the square will look is a fairly simple matter, but this too can be simplified by mentally drawing just one line - the diagonal of the square. 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 21la
[diagram]
Chapter 4 - Techniques of Calculation 129 The diagonal line from h3 to c8 in Position 2 1 1 a shows at once that the king is inside the square of the h3-pawn. The case demonstrated in the next diagram is very important in practical play:
[diagram]
The pawn on h2 hasn't yet moved and may take a double step forward to h4; just like a pawn on h3, it requires five moves to reach h8. It follows that the "square" of an h2-pawn is the same as that of an h3-pawn. The black king is located outside the confines of this square, so if White advances to h4 the king will not catch the pawn. The rule of the square is valid without reservation if only two pieces - the pawn and the enemy king - are in contention. If however the pawn can be helped by its own king or if there are additional pieces on the board, then the rule of the square may not hold true. In Diagram 2 1 1 , for instance, let us add a black pawn on f6. This might appear to help Black's cause, and yet this very pawn brings about his downfall as it obstructs the king's route to g?. With due allowance for such hindrances, the rule of the square should be borne in mind in all cases where the king is fighting against pawns. 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1
[diagram]
Draw White cannot take the pawn on d4, as his king would then be stepping outside the square of the b3-pawn. For the same reason, Black cannot take the pawn on g5. In both cases the pawns are securely defending each other, and there is nothing left for the kings to do except repeat moves to stop the pawns from advancing further 1. <i!? d2 <i!? h7 2. <i!? d3 <i!?g6 The kings will continue moving in this manner and the game will be a draw. The following case, shown in Diagram 2 1 4, is often seen in practice. 1 30 The Soviet Chess Primer
[diagram]
White wins The black pawn on a3 is defenceless, while the white pawns can look after themselves. If the black king attacks one of them, the other will advance, putting paid to the king's aggressive designs.
[diagram]
Knowing about the foregoing positions, we can easily ascertain that if it is White to move here, he wins by:
1.h4
His pawns defend each other without their king's aid, while the king will round up the a6- pawn. If however it is Black's move in Position 2 1 5, then he has: l.. .a5 The white king is now outside the square of the black pawn and must immediately step inside it.
2.<i�?e2 a4 3.
<i!?d2 The a-pawn will admittedly not queen, yet both the white pawns perish: 3 • • • <i!?xf3 To win the second pawn, Black must not play .. .'�g2?, as the reply would be h2-h4 and his king would be left outside the square of the h-pawn. The correct way, of course, is ...�f3- g4-h3. The rule of the square sometimes comes into play in a position where it looks as if the end is still a long way off (compare Diagram 208 on page 1 18). J. Berger, 1 889 a ·b c d e f g h White to move Chapter 4 - Techniques of Calculation 1 3 1 If White goes into the ending with 1 .E:xb6t Rxb6 2.Rxf6t �c5, then a draw is unavoidable, whether or not he exchanges queens. There is, however, a correct path: I.Rxf6t �xf6 2.E:xb6t s!?e5 3.E:xf6 s!?xf6
4.b6
White wins, because there is no stopping the pawn. Our knowledge of the rule of the square tells us when we should hurry to advance our pawn and when a different move would serve us better. 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 D. Ponziani, 1782

Reti, 1 92 1

White to move - Draw The white king is a long way outside the square of the pawn on h5, and pursuing it appears senseless. White's own pawn on c6 looks irrelevant, as the black king is too close. And yet - however strange this may seem - the presence of the c6-pawn actually secures White a draw. Let us see:

Black is powerless to oppose both plans at once. 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 218a R. Reti, 1928

White to move - Draw The possibility of a draw looks even more unlikely here than in the previous position. Nonetheless, by employing the same idea, White saves himself from the loss that appears inevitable. He plays 1 . 'it>g6, then continues (in answer to any move by Black) with 2.'it>xg7. By now there should be no difficulty in finding the remaining moves (figure out the variations for yourself!).
2. THE COUNTING OF MOVES
(OR SQUARES)
A device of no less significance than the rule of the square is a simple arithmetical count.
[diagram]
White to move White needs to spend three moves on capturing the g5-pawn, then one move on stepping aside to the right or left with his king, and four moves advancing his g4-pawn to queen - eight moves in total. Black similarly needs eight moves to queen his a6-pawn. Both sides will obtain a queen at the same time - White will (since he moves first from the diagram), and immediately afterwards Black will. This count demonstrates that the game will end in a draw, since in the position arising after the pawns promote, neither side can win the enemy queen or give mate. Chapter 4 - Techniques of Calculation 133
[diagram]
White to move White needs six moves to queen his pawn, Black only needs five. But it is White to move first, and consequently he will obtain a queen just after Black does, thereby securing a draw. An important point to note is the following. 1. 'it>xb5 'it>xh3 White has to move his king aside to dear his pawn's path. He must make this move with care, for in the wrong position his king will be exposed to a winning check from Black's new queen. For example:
2.'it>c6? 'it>g4 3.b5 h3 4.b6 h2 5.b7 hl=i!Yt
Owing to the check, White will not now obtain a queen; by the process that was shown in Position 85 (on page 62), Black will not only stop the pawn on b7 from promoting, he will win it. Or again:
2.'it>a4? 'it>g4 3.b5 h3 4.b6 h2 5.b7 hl=i!Y
6.h8=i!Y
And now Black wins the white queen: 6 •• •Y!Yal t 7.'it>..- i!Yblt Any move off the b-file other than 2.'it>c6? or
2.�a4? is completely safe.
8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 a b c d e f g White to move Here White can win the pawn on b6 or the one on g5. If he goes after the b6-pawn, it will take him 7 moves to queen his own b4-pawn. Within that time, Black will promote his g5- pawn (likewise 7 moves). The result will be a draw. If on the other hand White plays to queen his g4-pawn, this will admittedly take eight moves, and yet Black will need nine to queen his b6-pawn. This means that at the moment when White plays g7-g8=V;V, Black's reply will be ...b2 and not ...b l =V;V. But with a queen on g8 when Black's pawn is still on b2, White wins. In this way, the counting of moves makes it easier to choose the right continuation. It must be emphasized that in such endgames there is danger in wasting time on any moves that are a distraction from the main purpose. For example, in the variation l .�e5 �d3
2.�f5 'it>c4, if instead of 3.�xg5 White plays
3.b5?, he will be letting the win slip, for after
3 ...�xb5 both sides will obtain queens at the same time. The redundant pawn move will prove to have been a decisive loss of tempo. The case where the pawns are on the rook's files is interesting. 1 34 The Soviet Chess Primer 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1

Black to move Black decided the game in striking manner: 63 ...�h4! After 64.�xh4 we reach a position analogous to Diagram 222, where the win depends on whose move it is. Being the first to move his king aside, Black wins. Instead, 63 ...�b4 64.�xf3 a5 would have been inadequate because of 65.�e3! (not
65.h4? which loses). White threatens to get his
king to a1, and in the event of 65 ...a4 66.�d2 �b3 67.�cl 'i!fa2 he draws with 68.�c2. If, in answer to 65.�e3, it occurs to Black to head the white king off with ...�c3, he will even lose - since White will not only be able to queen his pawn (thanks to the black king obstructing the long diagonal), he will actually win the black queen with a skewer. 0-1 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 223a

White then draws as in Position 86 (see page 63). Chapter 4 - Techniques of Calculation 135 224 225
[diagram]
Whoever moves first wim In Example 224 (a skewer to win the queen!) it isn't hard to work out the play for yourself. So in the endgames we have looked at, the chances ofgaining a queen are easily ascertained by the counting of moves. But then you need to form a mental picture of the ensuing position (the squares where the kings and queens will be placed) in order to take account of possible attacks and their consequences.
3. COUNTING THE NUMBER
OF ATTACKS
Counting the number of attacks and defences is often of great importance in a game. This is well illustrated by the following textbook examples from Edward Lasker.
[diagram]
A beginner on the point of playing ... e5 will usually reason like this: I move my pawn forward, then my opponent takes it with his pawn; I take with a knight, he takes with his knight; I take with my bishop, he ... and so on. This method of calculation is quite wrong; time and mental energy are wasted. On reaching the third or fourth move, the beginner is likely to forget which pieces have already been exchanged, and he will get mixed up in his calculations. It is more correct and simpler to reason as follows: I move my pawn forward, then it will be under attack from six white pieces, but there are also six pieces defending it, and moreover the value of the attacking and defending pieces is the same; it follows that the move ...e5 is perfectly safe. It remains to add that after satisfying ourselves in this purely arithmetical manner that ...e5 is playable, we need to visualize the position resulting from the possible all-out exchange and consider what continuations might follow - whether or not they are in our favour. It is much easier to do this if our mental energy hasn't been wasted on working our way through the exchanges, and our attention hasn't become dulled. 1 36 The Soviet Chess Primer Let us suppose that in Position 225 the black h-pawn is still on h7. It then turns out that ...e5 is not playable. The point is that after exchanges, all the minor pieces and both rooks will have disappeared from the board, leaving just the queens - the white one on d2 and the black one on e5; it will be White to move, all lines will be open, and with 1Mfd8 White will mate the black king. In addition, before making a move such as ... e5 which allows White to begin a sequence of forcing moves (captures!) and, most importantly, to break off this sequence at any moment in pursuit of other ideas, it is useful for us to visualize the disappearance of this or that piece and the consequences that this will have (the opening of lines, etc.) . Suppose the white queen in Position 225 is on c2 (instead of d2). Then our arithmetical count is made complicated by the pin against the knight on c6. White will be able to answer ... tDxe5 with 1Mfxc7, eliminating one of the defending pieces and upsetting the arithmetical balance. Now consider a few more examples in which the very important procedure of counting comes up against various complications.
[diagram]
To play ... tDxe4 here, on the grounds that the e4-pawn is attacked three times and defended only twice, would be a mistake. The value of the attacking and defending pieces is unequal, and Black loses the exchange.
[diagram]
In this example, the pieces attacking the e4-pawn are themselves in the line of fire. Consequently l ...tDxe4 is unplayable owing to 2J!xc6, which leaves the knight undefended and enables White to win two pieces for a rook and pawn. For the same reason l .. . .Bxe4 also fails, to 2.E:xf6. If Black then tried to extricate himself with 2 ... .Bxf3, he would even come out a whole piece down after 3.E:xf3 (be sure you understand how this happened) . Chapter 4 - Techniques of Calculation 137
[diagram]
In the event of Lixc7, Black replies l .. . a6 and wins one of the pieces. The position of the attacking pieces is just as insecure after l .tt:'lxc7 on account of l ...g5! 2.Bd6 �c6 3.tt:'le8 Bf7, and again one of them is lost. The quantity of possible attacks and defences always needs to be anticipated. Let us for instance take the following position: 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1
[diagram]
If Black wants to play ... d4 here, he should first perform the following calculation. On d4 the pawn will be under attack from one piece and defended by one piece. But with his next three moves White can bring three more pieces up (l .l':'!:d 1 , 2.l':'!:cd2, 3.Bf2) . During that time, however, Black will mobilize three pieces for the defence (l ...tt:'le6, 2 ... Bg7, 3 ... l':'!:ed8). Thus the pawn will not be in immediate danger; nor does there seem to be any possibility for White in the near future to increase his attack or to strike at any of the defending pieces. It would be wrong, however, for Black to answer l':'!:d1 with ...d3, as White could then attack the pawn with a further two pieces - his other rook and his knight - while Black would have only one extra defence ( ... :B:ed8).
4. THE "WANDERING SQUARE"
In Position 2 1 4 (on page 1 30) we encountered a pair of separated pawns that were defending themselves. Separated pawns like these, however, not only possess a certain defensive strength - their aggressive power is also sometimes great, and quite often they can go through to queen wholly independently, that is without the help of their king. Diagram 230 can serve as an example.
A. 230
Studenetsky, 1939
[diagram]
Whichever side is to move, one of the black pawns will queen independently 1 38 The Soviet Chess Primer Practical guideline: at each turn Black must move the pawn that is further from the enemy king. In such positions it is useful to apply Studenetsky's principle of the "wandering square". It amounts to the following: Two separated pawns, say on e6 and h6, are at the corners of a common square: e6-h6-h3-e3. As the pawns advance, the position of the square also changes. When this mobile square incorporates the final rank (see Diagram 230) or extends beyond it, the king is helpless against the pawns. If the square doesn't reach as far as the final rank, the pawns cannot be queened (see Diagram 23 1).
[diagram]
Here the black pawns are doomed - they don't even possess any defensive strength (a distance of two files in between the pawns is the most disadvantageous). l • . . d4 White naturally replies with:
2.i>c4
After winning the d-pawn he has time to enter the square of the advancing a-pawn. If it is White to move, he plays: l.i>a4 d4 2.i>b3! Continuing as in the foregoing vananon (but not 2.�xa5 on account of 2 ...d3). If the pawn on d5 were transferred to c5, the separated pawns could at least defend themselves, and the game would be a draw. Yet if the black king were entirely deprived of moves, the pawns would once again succumb (see Diagram 232).
[diagram]
l.i>c3 Black must resign after this waiting move. A notable factor here is the defensive position of the doubled pawns on h5 and h6. The black king has to stay in touch with the g7 -square and is therefore totally paralysed. For their part, the white pawns cannot move either. Chapter 4 - Techniques of Calculation
[diagram]
It's easy to establish that Black wins here. If the position of the pieces is shifted one square further up the board, Black still wins, as his pawns on c7 and h7 have the right to make a double advance. Diagram 234, where there is less distance between the pawns, presents a different picture. 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1
[diagram]
Here the pawns cannot independently advance to queen. For example: l.�f6 d6 Not l ...dS, as after 2.'�e5 both pawns will succumb.
2.�5
White too is forced to defend carefully;
2.'�e6 would lose to 2 ...h5.
2 • • • h6! 3.�£6 (or 3.�f4) White is compelled to keep to these squares without having the possibility to attack either of the black pawns. But then Black for his part cannot advance either of the pawns to the 4th rank (counting from his end), as that pawn would quickly fall, with the other one to follow. Therefore if the black king were deprived of mobility (place it on a8, add a black pawn on b7 and white ones on a7 and b6), the d- and h-pawns would inescapably perish. The rule of the "wandering square" needs refining in some senses, given that it says nothing about the position of the opponent's king or about cases where one of the pawns is further advanced; nor does it take account of cases where it makes a crucial difference which side is to move. It goes without saying that the rule is invalidated if the opponent has his king on a square from which it can capture one of the pawns and it is his turn to move, or sometimes even when it is not his turn (for instance if we place the white king on b3 in the next diagram, number 235). Moreover exceptions are possible when the pawns are on the 6th rank (counting from their own end) with one square separating them.
140 The Soviet Chess Primer
[diagram]
Both sides are in zugzwang Whoever moves loses lfit is Black to move, the rule of the "wandering square" is not valid. Nonetheless, if we allow for the exceptions that have just been indicated, this rule is very convenient and eases the task of calculation on which a move is based. Finally let us look at a case where there are separated pawns on both sides: Stoltz - Nimzowitsch, Berlin 1928
[diagram]
Black to move l.. . f4 2.gxf4t �d6!! An unexpected move that clarifies the position at once. The black pawns are unstoppable, while an advancing white pawn can be halted at the last moment by a single move (to c7 or e7), that is with a minimal loss of time. Hence Black advances his pawns more quickly, and wins. Instead 2 .. 5�7xf4 would be bad, since the b5-pawn would queen with check.
5. CRITICAL SQUARES FOR
A PASSED PAWN
In the endgame it is often essential to advance your pawn to its queening square with the aid of your king. Clearly, in order to win you need to send the king on ahead, so as to gain control of the squares over which the pawn will pass. But where, precisely, should the king go? And will the win be achieved? Calculation is greatly facilitated if you know that the secret of all such endings lies in gaining possession of the pawn's "critical" squares. P. Dur237 and, 1 871

White to move wim - Black to move draws Chapter 4 - Techniques of Calculation 1 4 1 For a pawn on e2, the "critical" or "decisive" squares - in other words the most sensitive ones from the opponent's viewpoint - are d4, e4 and f4, separated from the pawn by one rank (see Diagram 237). Rule: If White can occupy one of the three critical squares (it doesn't matter which) with his king, then he wins easily, irrespective of where the black king is placed, and no matter whose move it is - unless Black is able to capture the pawn with his very first move. IfWhite cannot occupy a critical square, the game is a draw, as it will not be possible to advance the pawn to queen. A simple arithmetical count in Position 237 shows that ifWhite moves first he can occupy any of the critical squares within three moves, and Black is unable to prevent this. On the other hand if Black begins, then in three moves he can reach e5 (or d5 or f5 - in opposition to the white king), preventing White from occupying any of the critical (or, if you like, "key") squares. It has to be borne in mind that as the pawn advances, the location of the critical squares changes accordingly. 238 238a 8 8 7 7 6 6 5 5 4 4 3 3 2 2 1 1 a b c d a b c d For a pawn on b3, the critical squares are aS, b5 and c5; for a pawn on b4, they a6, b6 and c6. But if the pawn advances still further towards the end of the board and reaches the fifth rank, the enemy king is left with little room for normal manoeuvring. This is an advantage for the attacking side (in this case White); in addition to the squares that are critical according to our original rule (a7, b7 and c7), there are now three new ones: a6, b6 and c6. Thus a pawn on the fifth rank (counting from its own end) has six critical squares (see Diagram 238a) . If the player with the pawn occupies any of these six critical squares with his king, the win is guaranteed, no matter where his opponent's king is placed. A number of such positions were given earlier, in Diagrams 75-80; let us explain their rationale.
142 The Soviet Chess Primer
[diagram]
White wins only if it is his move In Position 239, White can queen his pawn only by occupying one of the squares b7 or d7 with his king. These are the fundamentally critical squares, or key squares - for which, ultimately, the fight is being conducted. If it is White's move, he attains his goal with l .c7. But if Black is to move, then with l . ..mb8, using the opposition as a means of defence, he stops his opponent from occupying the key b7-square. After 2.c7t �c8 that square is still inaccessible to White, and the game is therefore drawn. 239a
[diagram]
White wins, whichever side is to move If it is Black to move in Position 239a, he is forced to concede one of the key squares immediately. If it is White's move, then after 1 .�b6 �b8 he gains the opposition for himself by means of 2.c6; now 2 ...�c8 is met by 3.c7 (as in Example 239), and White conquers the key square b7. Let us return to Position 237 and see how the win is achieved: I.<it>d2 <it>e7 2.i>d3 i>d6 3.i>e4 White has seized a critical square. 3 ... i>e6 Black has placed himself in opposmon, which means he is barring the white king from the squares d5, e5 and f5.
4.e3
Now the squares d5, e5 and f5 have become the critical ones; if it were White's move now, he could not gain access to any of these squares, and the position would be drawn. 4 ... <it>f6 5.i>d5 Again occupying a critical square. 5 ... i>f7 If 5 ...�e7, then 6.�e5.

Ensuring the advance e3-e4, since a critical square for the pawn on e4 has now already been occupied; on 6 ...�f6 for example, 7.e4 is playable. 6 ... <it>f8 7.e4 i>f7 8.e5 White's pawn has reached the 5th rank, and his king is on a critical square. The win is not complicated: if 8 ...�f8, then 9.md7, and the pawn goes through; or if 8 ...�e8, then 9.me6 etc. This example shows that the pawn should only be advanced when control of its new critical squares is assured.

lhere is one key square - b 7! In the case of a rook's pawn there is only one key square (see Diagram 240), and the possibility of occupying it decides the outcome. If the black king succeeds in occupying the c8- square, a draw is unavoidable. 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1
[diagram]
White wins l.�c3 � ....2.�d4 Any move other than I.<;!;>c3 would be an irreparable error, allowing Black to draw. For example: I .c;!;>b3? c;!;>b5! or I .c;!;>a3? c;!;>a5!; or I .c;!;>a2? c;!;>b6! (to answer 2.c;!;>a3 or 2.c;!;>b3 with 2 ... c;!;>a5 or 2 ... c;!;>b5). The moves with the black king must be made with care, so that the critical squares can be defended. 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1
[diagram]
Here the game is a draw irrespective of who is to move, as White cannot gain possession of a critical square. If it is Black's move, the one way to draw is: l.. . c;!;>d6! So as to be able to meet 2. c;!;>d3 with 2 ... c;!;>d5; or if 2.c;!;>d2, then 2 ... c;!;>c6! (3.c;!;>c3 c;!;>c5!). But Black loses if he begins with L..c;!;>d5?, in view of the reply 2.c;!;>d3 (for example: 2 ... c;!;>c5
3.c;!;>c3 c;!;>b5 4.c;!;>b3 c;!;>as s.c;!;>c4, occupying a
critical square). As we can see from this example alone, king and-pawn endings require delicate handling, but calculation is facilitated when the idea that In Position 241 , the key squares are b4, c4 underlies an ending is clear to us. and d4. We can see at once that Black cannot defend the d4-square, and we win easily with:
144 The Soviet Chess Primer
[diagram]
White to move wins (similarly with the pawn on b4) Here the critical squares are b5, c5 and d5. The furthest away, and hence the most vulnerable from Black's point of view, is b5. White therefore heads for that point:
1. �c2! �e7 2.�b3 �d6 3.�b4! �c6 4. �c4
White occupies one of the critical squares with his next move. A mistake would be l .�d2?, on account of l ...i>e7 2.i>d3 i>d7! (with the same idea as in Position 242), and White cannot gain possession of a critical square. We now proceed to some complex examples. 8 7 6 5 2 1
[diagram]
White to move wim Winning for White doesn't look difficult: he picks up the a4-pawn and conquers a critical square at the same time. Black, however, has the sly defence ...a3 up his sleeve. Then if White plays bxa3, his pawn becomes a rook's pawn and there will be no win. Obviously he will have to answer ... a3 with b2-b3; then the critical squares will be transferred to a5, b5 and c5. Of these, a5 will be the most vulnerable from Black's viewpoint. So seizing this square (or either of the other critical ones) should be White's immediate task. However, the natural move 1 . i>c3 fails to achieve this aim, since in order to win the a-pawn after l ...a3 2.b3 White must either play b3-b4 and i>b3 - when the critical squares change to a6/b6/c6 and become inaccessible to him - or else try i>c3-c2-b 1-a2. But that would mean losing two tempos in treading a path which White can embark on immediately without any superfluous king moves. The solution is now clear: l.�bl! a3! 2.b3! �e5 3.�a2 �d5 4.�xa3 �c5 5. �a4 �b6 6. �b4 White can now occupy a critical square - a5 or c5 - and easily wins.

6. CRITICAL SQUARES FOR A
BLOCKED PAWN
For blocked pawns, deprived of mobility (see Diagram 248), the system of critical squares is different. For a black pawn on d5, the critical squares are e5/f5/g5 and a5/b5/c5; correspondingly for a white pawn on d4, they are e4/f4/g4 and a4/b4/c4. 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 l.�g5 P. Dur248 and, 1 871

Here White wins the b6-pawn and with it the game, since his own pawn is on the fifth rank: l.�c3 �b7 2.�d4 �c7 3.�e5 Threatening to occupy the e6-square. 3 ...�d7 Black has defended all three of the critical squares, but he is forced to concede one of them after White's reply:

White wins. Study by an unknown author

White to play and win The difficulty of winning this position is due to the threat of ... <i>b7 and ... c6, exchanging White's pawn and leaving him with only his knight.

2.ltld5 c6.
The winning move is pretty: I.ftlb6t! If Black takes the knight, a position with blocked pawns arises, and White wins by gaining possession of one of the critical squares for the b6-pawn (c6, d6, e6). On the other hand if I ...'kt>b7, then 2.ltlc4, barring the black king's approach to the b5-pawn (an important case of knight and pawn cooperating). On 2 ...c6 White plays 3.b6, and his pawn is securely defended while he brings his king up; another possibility is 3.ltla5t 'kt>b6 4.bxc6, and Black cannot take the knight, as his king would be stepping outside the square of the pawn. 1 48 The Soviet Chess Primer 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1

White wins An attempt to queen the c-pawn is hopeless: l .�e6 �c8! (diagonal opposition) 2.�d6 'it>d8!, and now 3.c7t �c8 4.�c6 would be stalemate. To win the game, White must sacrifice his c-pawn and then win the black pawn on b6 after occupying one of its critical squares. IfWhite is to move, the solution is as follows: 1. i>e6 i>c8! 2.c7! i>xc7 White answers 2 ...�b7 with 3.�d7, and after 3 ...�a7 he promotes his pawn to a rook! If Black is to move:
1. .. i>c8! 2.c7 i>d7
2 ...�xc7 3.�e6 and the king reaches a critical square.
[diagram]
In Position 252 White cannot win, as he is unable to seize the critical squares for the b4-pawn. If he gives up his a-pawn for the black b-pawn (after �b2 and a2-a3 or a2-a4), he cannot dominate the critical squares for the remaining pawn on b3. 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 252a
[diagram]
The situation of the kings in Diagram 252a, with one square in between them, is - as we know - called the opposition. It should be noted that if there are three or five squares between the kings, we still call this the opposition - the distant opposition. The kings are in this distant opposition in Diagram 252: Chapter 4 - Techniques of Calculation 1 49 1. 'it> c2 'it> c6 Black retains the distant opposition, at a distance of three squares this time instead of five.
2. 'ii>
d3 'it>d5 Here the manoeuvring of the black king is restricted by White's pawn on a4: Black mustn't step outside the square of that pawn, but at the same time he has to defend the critical squares of his own b4-pawn. Taking up the customary stance of near If White is to move, then he wins with: opposition (see Diagram 252a) and defending all the critical squares. 1.'ii> e3! 'it>d5 2. 'ii> d3 'it>c5 3.

'it>d4. Retention of the distant opposition is sometimes essential with every move, but in Example 252, where Black's task is merely to guard the critical squares c4/d4/e4, he only needs to oscillate with his king between d6 and e6 for the purpose of answering White's 'ii> d3 or 'tt> e3 with ... 'tt> d5 or ... 'tt> e5 respectively. On 'tt> f3 he should move into diagonal opposition with ... 'tt> d5!, to retain the option of meeting 'tt> e3 with ... 'tt> e5, or 'tt> f4? with ... 'tt> d4!. 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 ���� �� ��
[diagram]
White to move wins Black to move draws l.. . 'it>d5! It is now useless for White to push his passed pawn - Black will catch and win it, and if in return White wins the b4-pawn, Black will be able to meet 'tt> xb4 with ... 'tt> b6!, drawing. Nor does White get anywhere after 2.'tt> f4 'tt> d4 3.'tt> f5 'tt> d5! (not 3 ... 'tt> c3, as the a-pawn will be first to queen) 4. 'tt> f6 'tt> d6 - and so on, all the way to the eighth rank. As another try, White could move his king along the 1 st and 2nd ranks or else along the g- and h-files, in order to wrest the opposition from Black at a crucial point as a result of his manoeuvres. In the former case, all the black king needs to do - just as in Position 252 - is move between the squares d6 and e6, so as to meet 'tt> d3 or 'tt> f3 with ... 'tt> d5, or to play ... 'tt> e5 in reply to 'tt> e3 or 'tt> g3. (On 'kt>h3 Black must again play ...�d5, so that he can answer 'tt> g3 with ... 'tt> e5, or meet 'kt>g4 with ... 'tt> e4!.) If the white king moves along the g- and h-files, Black's simplest course is to take the distant or near opposition at every turn, without stepping outside the square of the a-pawn. For example: 2.'tt> g4 'tt> e4 3.'tt> h4 'tt> d4
4.'tt>
h5 �d5 5.'tt> g6 'tt> e6 6.'tt> h6 'tt> d6 7.'tt> g5 'tt> e5 8.�h4 'tt> d4 9.'tt> g3 'tt> e5! etc. 1 50 The Soviet Chess Primer 253a
[diagram]
White wins The most remote of the critical squares, e5, is outside the square of the passed pawn, and Black cannot successfully guard it against invasion by the white king, seeing that he has to watch the a5-pawn at the same time. If the white king goes to d4 Black can indeed reply with ... 'it>d6, but then after 'it>e4 he cannot play ... 'it>e6 because the a-pawn would advance; while ... 'it>c6 loses to 'it>e5.
[diagram]
The black king is already on a critical square for the d4-pawn, while the white king has not occupied the corresponding critical square for the d5-pawn. The advantage is therefore with Black, and he wins the white pawn irrespective of who is to move. However, he has to be careful to attack the pawn the right way. l.. . c!>e3! Black mustn't play l ...'it>e4?, as after 2.'it>c5 he would lose.
2.i>c5? c!>e4
This move has now been played at the correct moment. This example makes clear how important it is to give due regard to the critical squares. Realizing that he cannot hold his own pawn, White has to answer 1 ... 'it>e3 with:
2. c!>c3! c!>e4 3.
c!>c2! Black wins the pawn, but White defends. 3 •• • c!>xd4 4. c!>d2! Attending to the defence of the critical squares for the d5-pawn (c3, d3, e3). If we shifted the position down the board by one rank, Black's pawn would be on the fifth rank counting from his end, and by winning the pawn on d3 he would also win the game. Chapter 4 - Techniques of Calculation 1 5 1

Equal chances Here the two kings are occupying mutually critical squares, and the player who moves next wins. But he must begin by attacking the pawn with the accurate move (Rd6 or ...Rf3)! Here are two more examples to conclude: 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1

First of all, by pushing his b-pawn, White destroys the protection of the black pawn on d5: l.b4 �d7 2.b5 cxb5 3.�xb5 Now the d5-pawn is doomed: 3 ... �d6 4.�b6 �d7 5.�c5 �e6 6.�c6 White wins after either of Black's replies: 6 ...�e7 6 ...Rf5 7.Rxd5 and Black needs seven moves to promote his pawn, White only five.

7. CORRESPONDING SQUARES
Sometimes the need arises to employ some fairly complex devices of calculation, of which the handling of "corresponding squares" can serve as an example. Some understanding of this device can be gained from the very simple textbook positions that were supplied by Soviet Master N. Grigoriev.
[diagram]
The first player to attack his opponent's pawn loses: I .'it>b5? is met by l . ..�a7. The kings therefore manoeuvre in such a way that a move to a7 by Black can always be answered by a move to b5 by White - and vice versa: 1. c;t>b4! c;t?as! 2. c;t?c4 c;t>bs 3. c;t>b4! c;t?as! The white king must not lose touch with the b5-square, while Black, correspondingly, must not lose touch with a?. There is enough space for the manoeuvring - each player only has one square that he needs to watch, so the game here ends in a draw. 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1
[diagram]
In Diagram 259, Black has to have the possibility of answering 'it>d6 with ... 'it>d8; otherwise he loses at once, as the pawn on c6 will go on to queen. From this, we identify a correspondence between the squares d6 and d8. In the diagram they are marked by the number " 1 ". White can also, however, play 'it>c5 with a threat to occupy the point b6 and win the a6-pawn. Black needs to be able to answer 'it>c5 with ... 'it>c7, thwarting White's plans. This establishes a correspondence between the squares c5 and c7; they are marked by the number "2". In the diagram we are looking at (number 259), the white king is placed so as to be able to occupy either of the squares " 1 " and "2"; but then Black is in a position to reply by moving to either of his " 1 " and "2" squares. Clearly there is an additional correspondence between the squares d5 and c8. In Diagram 259a they are marked as " 3" . After I .'it>d5-d4 (from Diagram 259), the white king has the option of going to either of the squares "2" and "3"; therefore Black has to play I ...'it>b8 or I ...'it>d8 (the former leads to Diagram 259a), so that he can correspondingly occupy his "2" square or his "3" square. Chapter 4 - Techniques of Calculation 1 53 259a
[diagram]
Up to this point, Black has always had the "corresponding" squares available. However, after playing 'kt>c4 (from Diagram 259a), White is still threatening to occupy square "2" or square "3", while Black lacks a second position from which he could move to either of his own "2" and "3" squares (seeing that b7 is inaccessible to him) . Black is forced to abandon the "correspondence", and loses. The solution to Position 259 is now clear:
1. <if?d4 <if?bs
Moving to the corresponding square. 2. <if?c4! <if?cS The correspondence is lost!
3.<if?d5
We arrive back at the situation we started from, but with the difference that this time Black is to move. No matter how Black now plays, the white king will occupy a decisive position: 3 ... 'kt>c7 is met by 4.'kt>c5, while on 3 ... 'kt>d8 (or 3 ... 'kt>b8) White plays 4.'kt>d6. The white king has made use of a "triangle" of squares - d5, d4, c4 - in a way that recalls Diagram 207 (see page 1 17). The secret of the "magic triangle" can now be understood: we have been utilizing "corresponding squares"! Here is a new example on the same theme: 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 Maizelis, 1 957
[diagram]
White wins White needs to occupy the c6-square with his king; then, after d5-d6, the win is simple. Let us now identify the "corresponding" squares. The situation of the kings in this diagram is the basic critical position, so we will mentally designate the squares c5 and d7 by the number " 1 ". The second decisive position involves the squares b5 and d6 (marked with the number "2") . The third pair of corresponding squares is c4 and e7 (marked by "3"). What conclusion emerges from this? White only needs to move his king to b4, from where he can occupy square " I ", "2" or "3" at his own choice - and Black will be deprived of a corresponding move, since the e6-square, which is analogous to b4, is inaccessible to him. White can play any move to start with, for example: 1 54 The Soviet Chess Primer l.�b5 Or l .�c4 �e7 ( l . . . c6 is met by 2.�c5!)

8. FURTHER DEVICES TO SIMPUFY
CALCULATION
From examining the devices of calculation that you have so far been shown, you will have grasped that they aren't relevant to all situations that can arise on the chessboard, but only to positions of a specific type. To be sure, these positions are encountered very often, and it is for just that reason that the simplified examples we have demonstrated are so valuable. Overall precepts for calculation, which would serve in all cases, cannot be established in chess. Every position has to be approached in a special way, in accordance with its content. And yet if some positions, notwithstanding the different configurations of the pieces, do display a high degree of similarity - if they are what is called typical - then there tend to be typical devices that apply to them. Knowing about these devices makes calculation easier - that is, it enables you, quickly and accurately, to evaluate the position and take a decision about the method of continuing the game. From this we can clearly see how great the importance of experience is in chess. Knowledge of a whole range of typical positions is just what distinguishes the experienced player from the novice. The former knows the shape of the play in such positions; he knows what to aim for, and how to go about it. In such cases the devices of calculation, the assessment of the position and the formulating of a plan are organically merged into the single whole which goes by the name of chess technique. These typical positions which allow you to employ simplified calculating devices are very numerous. The following are a few examples that are important for practical play.

Chapter 4 - Techniques of Calculation 1 55 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1
[diagram]
In both of these positions, White has a pawn majority on the flank (three pawns against two). By exchanging, he can obtain a passed pawn. How must he play, to bring this about? To set about creating a passed pawn, White begins by moving the pawn which has no enemy ahead of it, and which, consequently, has the greatest expectation of becoming "passed". In Position 26 1 , White should continue as follows: l.c4! White's plan consists of b2-b4, c4-c5 (again the c-pawn is the first to advance to a new rank), b4-b5 and c5-c6!. Should Black reply to l .c4 with l ...a5, White mustn't continue with
2.a3? (aiming for b2-b4) on account of 2 ...a4,
when the white pawns are brought to a halt. The correct method is 2.b3, then a2-a3, and finally b3-b4. Whereas in Position 262, the correct continuation is: l.b4! White aims to place his pawns on the fifth rank (b4-b5!, then a4-a5 and c4-c5) and play b5-b6!, obtaining a passed pawn. It would be a mistake in Position 26 1 to play I .b4. After l ...b5, the white pawns are stopped.

Here the players have a passed pawn each, but the a-pawn is nearer to the edge of the board, and further away from the black king than the c-pawn is from the white king. The advance of the a-pawn will compel the black king to deviate to the edge, and as a result Black will lose all his pawns. Thanks to his outside passed pawn, White wins: l.a4 c.!?b6 2.a5t c.!?xa5 Otherwise the pawn advances further.
3.c.!?xc5
The white king will now heads towards the h- and g-pawns. 1 56 The Soviet Chess Primer
[diagram]
Here, the outside passed pawn is the one on c4. The advance of this pawn will divert the black king, after which the e5-pawn falls and the g-pawn is doomed. But Black, of course, will go after the a-pawn. Thus the concept of the outside passed pawn is combined, in this case, with the rule of counting. A move count shows us that after l .c5t �xc5 2.�xe5, White and Black need 8 moves each to obtain a queen. But it is Black to move next; so he will promote his pawn first, and the white king on g7 will be checked by the new queen on al . This will prevent White from promoting his pawn on h7 (the game will be a draw, on the lines of Position 86 on page 63). However, White can alter the picture by putting off the advance of his passed c4-pawn: l.h4! White has made a useful move, bringing his h-pawn closer to its ultimate goal, while Black cannot make a similar useful move of his own. On l ...�e6, White continues with 2.c5 etc. If Black plays 1 ...�c5, then with 2. �xe5 White obtains a queen two moves sooner and prevents Black from queening. Finally, 1 ... g6 brings the g-pawn closer to the white king; now 2.c5t wins easily, since after 2 ...�xc5
3.�xe5 Black needs eight moves to queen his
pawn, while White needs only six.

Samuel Reshevsky was once asked how far ahead he calculated variations. Probably in jest, but at any rate in strict accordance with the demands of American self-publicity, he replied: "One move further than my opponent". To an analogous question, Richard Reti replied - without any "clever" sophistry - that there was usually no cause to calculate moves a long way ahead at all, but that if there were few variations and they were forced, it was no doubt possible to calculate 20 moves ahead and more. It was once recorded in print that in a certain game a player had announced mate in 30 moves - but that was a game by correspondence. Once when giving a blindfold display, the distinguished nineteenth-century grandmaster Joseph Blackburne announced a mate in sixteen. This was checked, and it was found that he was not mistaken. One of the greatest chess geniuses of all time - Alexander Alekhine - had phenomenal powers of calculation. It is said that one day he was shown a position and asked how he would play from there; the position was from a game Anderssen - Zukertort (1 862), in which Anderssen sacrificed his queen and achieved a draw with the aid of a pretty combination. After a little thought, Alekhine came out with the same moves that had been made by Anderssen. However, on cogitating for a few minutes more, he indicated a different line which would have won, not drawn! But not infrequently in chess games, positions of exceptional complexity can arise. In the eleventh Capablanca - Alekhine match game of 1 927, Capablanca, who was renowned for his speed of play, spent two hours thinking about a single move, and Alekhine needed an hour and three quarters for his reply. Chapter 4 - Techniques of Calculation 1 57 However that may be, the long-range calculation of variations is an astounding faculty of the human mind. The development of this faculty - such an essential one for practical chessplayers - can undoubtedly be achieved through systematic exercises.
SHORT GAMES
At first you might think it would be difficult to find examples of short games in which variations of some length were calculated, but in reality there are plenty of them. At any rate, consider the following cases in which forced lines of play arose after just a few opening moves. 1 Schlechter - S. Wolf, Vienna 1 894 l.e4 e6 2.d4 d5 3.�c3 �f6 4 . .Bg5 .Be7 s . .ix£6 .ix£6 6.�a O-O 7.e5 J.e7 s.J.d3 .Bd7? Better was 8 ...c5 in place of this weak move.

ANSWERS AND SOLUTIONS
1. l.Rc8! Rc6 (White threatened 2.a6) 2.WbS Rb5 3.Rb7!! Rxa5 4.Rc6, and the white king

2. l.f7! Rg7 2 • .Be7! Rxf7 3 • .Bb4!. The knight on bl finds its retreat cut off, and White wins it
by means ofWf2-e3-d3 etc. - but not by moving his king along the 1st rank, as Black would then be able to play ...e6-e5-e4-e3 and ... lLlbl-d2.

Therefore: l.lLlg3!! fxg3 (2.lLlf5t was threatened) 2.a3 i.f2 3.Ra2 i.el (Now White gets nowhere with 4.�b3 .Bd2 5.�b4 .icl , so he makes use of "triangulation" in order to gain a tempo.) 4.Wal!! i.d2 5.Wbl! i.el Panic retreat. 6.Wcl i.f2 7.Wdl i.gl S.Wel i.h2 9.Wfl and wins. Another "elephant hunting" episode (compare pages 1 24-6).
7. The white king gains the distant opposition, which enables it to advance to the target square
b6. The secret of White's manoeuvring is this: whenever the black king is on the b-file (which here counts as the "main thoroughfare"), White takes the opposition; when Black is on the a-file, White advances via a "detour" on the c-file. So l.Ra2! WbS! 2.Rb2! WaS 3.Rc3! Rb7 (if 3 ...�a7, then 4.i>c4!) 4.Rb3! Ra7 5.Rc4 Wbs 6.Rb4 Was 7.Rc5 Rb7 s.Rb5 Ra7 9.Rc6 WbS (or 9 .. .'�a8 1 0.i>c7) 10.Rb6 WaS ll.Elc8#. Should Black gain the opposition (through a mistake in White's manoeuvres, or if it is Black to move in the initial position and he plays l ...�a7), the problem cannot be solved.

Chapter 5 Combination
1. COMBINATIVE MOTIFS AND IDEAS
We already know that a combination is the name given to the concerted action of some pieces which takes the form of a forced variation involving the sacrifice of material - as a result of which a player counts on obtaining benefits of some kind. The purpose of a combination may be to give mate or to win material, or sometimes it may be to save the player from defeat by bringing about perpetual check or stalemate. But then again, a combination may also pursue such aims as breaking up your opponent's pawn formation, or seizing some good squares or lines for your pieces, or exchanging your opponent's active pieces off, and so forth. In these latter cases, with the aid of the combination, you are acquiring what are known as positional assets - that is, an advantage in the placing of your pieces. The most characteristic things about a combination are the forced nature of the moves that constitute it and also, in most cases, their unexpectedness (sacrifice!) - which strikes us most forcefully (and also finds its explanation) in the culminating point, the climax which defines the essence of the combination. Even though a combination follows logically from the position on the board, the unconventional nature of some of the moves (material sacrifice) disrupts, so to speak, the normal flow of the game, and abruptly steers it into a new channel (like a jump or an explosion). The result is a different correlation of forces on the chessboard and a completely new setting for the struggle. In the positions given below, try to find the combination for yourself each time, before reading on.

The rook check was a preparatory move, the exchange sacrifice was the climax of the combination; its idea consisted in drawing the king onto an unpropitious square exposed to the dual attack from the knight. As the result of this combination all Black's pieces are eliminated, and further resistance on his part is senseless.

Black to move l ... .Bb4! Black wins the queen for a minor piece, since capturing the bishop is met by:
2.Yfxb4 �:xc2t
A combination is not possible in every position. In various examples, the basis of the combination - the motif which suggests its very possibility - is the location of some enemy pieces in a straight line (a diagonal in this last example), in other words a motif of a purely geometric type. Drawing the hostile pieces onto squares exposed to a knight's fork constitutes the idea of the following combinations. Chapter 5 - Combination 1 67

The combination in Position 269 is a good deal more complex. In this case, the device of drawing the king onto a specific square enables a decisive dual attack that is performed by a pawn promotion. 8 7 6 5 4 3
[diagram]
White to move t.a:cSt! a:xc8 2.Wfa7t!! <if?xa7 3.bxc8=c!Llt! White wins back the queen and emerges with an extra piece. This clearly brings out the meaning of a combination - a tactical stroke that uses time economically and is crushing in its effect. If White failed to find it, his own king could easily fall victim to an attack by the opponent's major pieces. The cramped position of the enemy forces is another factor that often gives rise to combinations. All the forms of cramping that we examined earlier - cutting squares off, obstructing lines of action, proximity to the edge of the board - can serve as the themes of combinations. 1 68 The Soviet Chess Primer 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 Sebestyen - Fiister, Budapest 1950

The examples we have examined give only a small quantity of the themes and ideas on which combinations are built. These themes and ideas are just as inexhaustible as the endless possible permutations in the number, arrangement and mutual influence of pieces on the chessboard. A spectacular and correct combination that represents the unique and and shortest path to victory will often produce a powerful effect by reason of its artistry. When studying the purpose and effect of some moves in Chapter 3 ("Tactics and Strategy"), we acquainted ourselves with the "mechanism" of combination - with forcing moves, with themes and ideas. To learn to carry out combinations yourself, you need to consolidate your knowledge in practical play; everything you have remembered should be tested and verified by your own experience. Continue to study the ideas and themes of combinations in master play; you must understand them first and then try applying them in practice.
2. TYPES OF COMBINATION AND
THEIR CHARACTERISTICS
In practical games especially those played by masters - you can find plenty of examples of beautiful and precisely calculated combinations. When exammmg these combinations - some fairly simple, others complex - it is most important to grasp the themes and ideas on which they are founded. We recommend that you memorize some combinations of various types that you come across in your study of the game, and mentally reproduce the moves that carried them out (that is, look at the board and work through all the variations of the combination in your head); in this way you will gradually develop your creative imagination Some of the combinations we have so far examined were calculated two or three moves ahead, but in the main they were one-movers, in which the preparation and climax were combined in a single stroke. The ensuing denouement was simple, and there were no alternative variations. From this, however, it by no means follows that combinations many moves long, or those with many variations, are always more complicated to work out or harder to find. Chapter 5 - Combination 17 1
[diagram]
Black to move Position 278 is from a variation that could have occurred in an actual game. Black saw that if the play led to this position, he could give mate in four moves: I..J�hSt! v;!?xhs ygh3t 3.ygh4 ygrst Black will mate on either g5 or g6 depending on White's reply. In the game, however, White saw this mate too, and didn't go in for the variation in question.
[diagram]
White to move In Position 279 (from a consultation game in 1 909), the continuation was: I.ht'7t! g;,xf7 l ...�xf7? 2.�e8t with mate next move.
2.ygxh7t g;,f6 3.ygh4t
Another route to victory is 3.Wfe7t <;f;>f5
4.Wfxf8t <;f;>g5 5.�e4! when the threat of 6.h4t
<;f;>h5 7.'Rh8# is decisive. 3 ... g;,g7 Other king moves are no good either: 3 ... <;f;>f7? 4.�e7t leads to mate, while 3 ... <;f;>f5
4.g4t <;f;>f4 5.Wfg3t wins the black queen. If
3 ...g5, then 4.Wfh6t <;f;>f7 5.Wfh7t <;f;>f6 6.Wfe7t is winning for White. 4J�e7t �f7 s.ygd4t g;,ffi 5 ... <;f;>g8 6.�e8t �f8 7.�xf8t <;f;>xf8 8.Wff6t <;f;>g8 9.�el and White will soon deliver checkmate.
6.ygh8t! g;,xe7 7.l:�el t g;,d6 8.ygd4#
In these last two examples there are a fair number of moves, and the play from Diagram 279 even involves several variations, but finding and calculating the combination isn't especially difficult in either case. In both positions, the opponent's material advantage and threats (in number 279, after ...d5, Black's extra piece would immediately tell!) demand the most resolute action from the attacker, and his options for this are few. But here are some more examples, this time a good deal more complex.

White to move In Position 280, Black has blocked White's check by playing his queen to e6, counting on answering 1 JMfb8t with 1 ... !k8. At this point Black offered a draw; he thought the inevitable continuation would be l .'Rxe6t ;gxe6 2 . .L:d4, with complete equality. However, White had an unexpected reply: t..ld6!!

An annotator gave I .liJf6t an exclamation mark, but later it was noticed that there was a mate in three moves: I.Y!Vxe6t! l ...�xe6 2.�g7t and mate follows on f8. It's hard to explain why this move wasn't seen at once. Perhaps Nimwwitsch was right when he once said that "a chessplayer will sooner put his head in a lion's mouth than place his queen under attack". C. Torre - N.N., New York (simul) 1 924

Combinations based on "quiet" moves (not involving checks or captures) are of course all the more difficult to find. Clearly the difficulty of a combination is not determined by the quantity of moves or variations. Combination is undoubtedly the soul of chess! Complex combinations are distinguished by an interweaving of themes. Earlier, in the "Tactics and Strategy" chapter, we gave some examples of combinations that were mostly based on a single theme of one kind or another. We now consider some more complicated examples.

Black breaks the communication (contact) between the white rooks, and by giving up his knight he picks up the rook on f6 - that is, he wins the exchange.

26 . .Bf3 hh2t White resigned. 0-1 1 82 The Soviet Chess Primer The geometric idea of occupying the "point of intersection" of two lines (to bring about an "interference") is interesting even though rarely encountered in practical play. The following position can serve as a striking example. Nenarokov - Grigoriev, Moscow (1 1) 1 923

At this point the d-pawn is prevented from queening by the rook, while the h-pawn is stopped by the bishop on c?. The lines of action of these two pieces intersect at d6. Now Black prettily exploits the idea of interference by placing his bishop on the "crossroads". 99 ... .Bd6!! If 1 00 . .Bxd6, then 1 00 ...d 1 =Wf, since the rook's line is shut off.

Pogrebyssky - Konstantinopolsky, Kiev 1932
[diagram]
Black to move The attack against the knight on g4 was met by a sacrifice: 20 •. . �xe3! Black had prepared this well in advance. Its point soon becomes clear.
21.Wi'xe3 .le4!!
Thanks to the pin that arises on the a7-g1 diagonal, Black can make use of the poor position of White's knight on b l . If for example 22.ltJd2, then 22 ... 1'%xd4 23 . .Bxf6 .Bxf6 24.ltJxe4 1'%xe4!. In view of this, White voluntarily returned the piece:
22.�c3 bxc3 23.bxc3 .Bg6
White is left with a weak pawn on the c3- square. Black eventually won this pawn, and with it the game. Chapter 5 - Combination 1 83 However, there remains one important variation that we have not yet examined. In this connection, and seeing that the case before us is a typical one, you should remember the following piece of practical advice: If a piece has been sacrificed against you, and this is not a combination of the "check, check, mate" type - if, in other words, you are left with some choice of moves - then first of all consider variations in which you immediately take a new piece from your opponent. With two pieces down he will be forced, as a rule, to follow one single continuation which is easy for you to calculate. You may come to the conclusion that your second capture is no use, but it is only then that you should proceed to examine other, possibly better, continuations. From this point of view, White first of all had to consider 22.Bxf6, after which a forced variation arises: 22 ... .Bxf6 23.WI'xe4 E:xd4
24.E:xd4 Wl'xd4t 25.WI'xd4 Bxd4t 26.�fl
:B:cl t 27.<:%Je2 E:xb l . Black has kept an extra pawn and is even winning a second one (provisionally), but with opposite-coloured bishops White's possibilities for fighting are not exhausted. For example: 28.E:d3 .Bf6 29.E:d6 E:xb2t 30.�8 a5 3 1 .E:a6 .Bd8 32.E:d6! .Be7 {or 32 ...Bc7 33.E:c6) 33.E:a6 We can see, then, that Black's combination was deep and sound, but after White's strongest reply (22.Bxf6!) Black would have had some hard work to do in the endgame . • . • 0-1 Here is another example with repeated mutual captures. Barda - Keres, Moscow ( ol) 1 956

White resigned. A more destructive raid by a rook is difficult to imagine. Rather like a game of "losing chess"! 0-1 So-called "trappy'' combinations are also frequently seen in practice. We are already acquainted with one example of a trap (see the brief game on page 79). Here is another example of a trappy combination. 1 84 The Soviet Chess Primer Steiner - Balogh, Bad Pistyan 1 922
[diagram]
White to move In this position White played "for the trap".
20.�g5
Black was now lured by the prospect of winning a pawn. 20 .. Jihc4? This was met by the combination:
21.�xc4! dxe4 22J:�xd6 gxd6 23.tLlg6t
With mate next move. 1-0 A trap begins by offering the opponent some kind of "bait", and if he is tempted by the material gain he is snared. Thus a trap differs from a genuine combination inasmuch as the first move - after which the forced variation begins - is not itself a move that your opponent is in any way forced to make. If he realizes what you have in mind and ignores the "bait", the trap you have concocted may turn out to be useless (it may have wasted a move or in some cases even worsened your own position). That is why playing for a trap is only appropriate when it can be combined with pursuing your normal game plan - or else when you are conducting a difficult and ultimately hopeless defence, and you have strictly nothing to lose. You can find some examples of traps in the supplements to this chapter.
3. THE TECHNIQUE OF
COMBINATIONS
''A combination has to be sound," Lasker once wrote, "otherwise it is just an attempt, a blunder, a delusion; put more simply, it is senseless." Sound combinations have to be accurately calculated in all variations; they have to take account of the opponent's replies (whether natural or the most extraordinary), and they have to yield beneficial results of some kind. To illustrate the point, consider a few combinations in which errors of one sort or another were committed. 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1

4. PREREQUISITES FOR
A COMBINATION
There are certain signs which can lead us to suppose that a combination is possible in the position before us, and that it makes sense to begin searching for it. Let us try to characterize those signs in a little more detail. From examples already given, we were able to convince ourselves that a prerequisite for combination is usually a preponderance of forces (or greater mobility of the pieces) which one side possesses in some particular sector of the board. If we are conducting an attack that does something to shake the enemy position, then the direction taken by the attack is usually also the direction in which we should be looking to find a combination. However, the necessary configuration of pieces for a combination doesn't always turn up "ready made", so to speak; in most cases it has to be created!

With 7.tDxf6t to follow. The fact that Black's king was defended by all the pieces he possessed was of no help to him. 1-0 We see that an essential precondition for a combination is the presence of weaknesses of some kind in the opponent's camp. Sometimes his weakness will be his king position which is too open or, on the contrary, too cramped. In other cases it will be the crowded position of his pieces, their limited mobility, their undefended state. In Example 320 which we have just examined, a crucial factor was the availability of open lines and diagonals (and the creation of extra ones) for the action of the white pieces (the queen on the c3-h8 diagonal and the rooks on the g-file). Thus when looking for a combination, the direction of our search is prompted by the location of our opponent's weak points. We shall familiarize ourselves in detail with various types of weakness in the next chapter, "Positional Play''. Here we would just note that a combination may be triggered by the bad placing of individual pieces, sometimes with limited possibilities of retreat. Botvinnik - Golombek, Moscow (ol) 1 956

White to move The knight on b5 is badly placed; in the event of a2-a4 it only has the square c7 to retreat to. How can this be utilized for a combination? l.hg7 <jjl xg7 2.gcl! Black resigned, anticipating the following moves: 2 ... Wfd7 3.a4 tDc7 4.Wfc3t 1-0 What is harder to find is a combination that crops up by chance - for combinations do also exploit the chance opportunities afforded by a momentary configuration of the pieces.

White to move Here the simplest course for White is to exchange queens and then, after <j{fl, to play E!:c1 -c6-a6 and gradually exploit his material superiority. But this method seemed to him to be too long-winded. U�c7 Trying to win "on the spot", but there is a stunning combinative refutation. l..Jk5! White had to resign at once. It is of course impossible to give any general guidelines for similar cases. But you must always be on the lookout and remember that one single move can sometimes make changes to the position such that an unexpected and previously unavailable combinative denouement becomes a reality. It's essential to develop your combinative abilities by studying good examples. This includes learning from practical experience. Positions may not repeat themselves exactly (though this does happen sometimes!), but the ideas of combinations definitely do recur. Kotov - Botvinnik, Leningrad 1 939

Black can only resign. Chapter 6 Positional Play A factor of paramount importance for successfully conducting the struggle is the positional structure: that is the overall arrangement of the pieces, their influence on each other and also on the squares and lines of the chessboard. With every move in a game we should endeavour, as far as possible, to improve our own position, to worsen that of our opponent and to exploit any kind of defect in his piece formation. There are many outward signs that enable us to judge whether a position is good or bad, and whether the move that we are thinking of making meets the positional requirements.
1. WEAK POINTS (SQUARES AND PAWNS)
Usually a fundamental role in the structure of the position is played by the pawns. This is understandable. Pawns possess very little mobility and are often unable to move at all - such as when they are blockaded, or when the squares ahead are inaccessible to them because placed under enemy attack. This causes pawns to remain in the same places for a more or less prolonged stretch of time, thus defining the general pattern of the position - or its "skeleton", as people sometimes figuratively call it. The pieces with greater mobility adapt themselves to the "pawn skeleton'' as they take up their positions, creating a "living tissue" of movements, manoeuvres and combinations in the process of the game. Pawn structures greatly vary. In some positions the pawns are arranged in unbroken chains, whereas in others they are in separated groups. They usually form a compact mass (connected pawns), but sometimes they are in a weakened state - split up and isolated. It's essential to familiarize yourself with these peculiarities of the pawn structure, so that you can learn to evaluate various positions in their entirety. 2 1 2 The Soviet Chess Primer
[diagram]
This diagram shows connected pawns. Pawns standing side by side occupy a formidable position, making the squares in front of them inaccessible to the enemy pieces. Should either of the pawns advance, however, the position of both of them is significantly weakened at once. Advanced pawns can easily be blocked and become objects of enemy attack on account of their immobility.
[diagram]
In Position 329 the blockading square f6 is occupied by the knight; for Black this square is a strong point. Black will direct his attacks against the backward pawn on f5 for the purpose of destroying the f5/g6 pawn chain, seeing that the f5-pawn is the foundation (base) of the chain and constitutes its weakest link.
[diagram]
It would be wrong to maintain that advanced pawns are always weak. In many cases the opponent doesn't even have the possibility of blocking them, and their position is sometimes very strong. For example in Position 330, White has a protected passed pawn - an investment for future victory - while the weak pawn on b5 is shielded by the black b6-pawn against frontal attacks (from a rook on b8, say).
[diagram]
Chapter 6 - Positional Play 2 1 3 Despite this, when moving any pawn it must never be forgotten that a pawn's advance weakens the squares next to it on the same rank - the squares that were previously under attack from this same pawn. In Position 33 1 , as a result of the moves made by the black b- and d-pawns, the square c6 is a weak point for Black (a strong point for White). If a minor piece is occupying such a position and cannot be exchanged, it is quite often equal in strength to a rook. The knight on c6 cannot be driven away by pawns, and if it is exchanged off, a protected passed pawn arises. Black is simply obliged to defend against the threats this piece creates - given that a number of points usually are threatened by a piece entrenched like this in the opponent's position. Under cover of the knight on c6 White may carry out a concentration of his forces; for example he may double rooks and then move the knight away at the right moment, clearing the c-file for the rooks to invade the seventh or eighth rank. We must now explain what kind of weaknesses can arise in a king's castled position - in the pawn "shield" which shelters the king from attacks. A castled position tends to be especially robust when the pawns are still on their starting squares, forming a solid wall (Position 332).
[diagram]
In the normal castled position (see Diagram 333), the points f2 and h2 are each defended twice. True, the g2-point is defended only once, but then it isn't so easy for the enemy pieces to mount an attack against it. A move with any of these three pawns usually weakens the position of the castled king, and since pawns cannot go backwards, the weakness is irreparable (lasting).
[diagram]
In Diagram 334 the castled position is slightly weakened. Imagine a white knight on f3, and black pawns on g5 and h5; then the 2 1 4 The Soviet Chess Primer move l ...g4 is highly unpleasant for White. In the event of 2.hxg4 hxg4, the h-file is opened, while the knight on f3 is also forced to abandon the defence of the h2-point. If instead of2.hxg4 the knight on f3 moves away somewhere, then after 2 ...gxh3 3.gxh3 a file for an attack by the enemy pieces is opened all the same, while the pawns on f2 and h3 are isolated and weakened. Thus the forwardpawn on h3 can be a convenient target for an enemy attack. The move h2-h3 sometimes has to be made in order to create a "loophole" for the king and thus guard against mate by a rook or queen on the first rank. The move should not, however, be made "just in case", but only when faced with actual danger or when the pawn's advance is needed for some special purposes; otherwise this move will in some measure weaken the position and will also waste a tempo, seeing that moves at the start of the game are better used for developing the pieces.
[diagram]
Everything we are saying here about a weakening of the pawn position applies chiefly to the middlegame. For example in Position 335, the move f2-f3 amounts to a serious weakening of the a7-gl diagonal (attacks by a bishop are possible, with unpleasant pins; recall Diagram 1 66); moreover a pawn on f3 is often depriving a knight of its best square. In the endgame, however, this move can be beneficial, as it allows the king to reach the centre quickly. 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1
[diagram]
In Position 336, the light squares are weak. However, ifWhite has a bishop on g2, covering the diagonals a8-hl and fl-h3 as well as the weak squares f3 and h3, his position in most cases is perfectly safe. (A position like this, with a bishop developed on the flank, is called a "fianchetto".)
[diagram]
Chapter 6 - Positional Play 2 1 5 The position i n Diagram 337 i s much worse. Here the dark squares are weak, diagonals are open, and there is a gaping "hole" on g3 - a convenient point for invasion by enemy pieces. 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1
[diagram]
The diagrams above show pawns that are split, isolated, and also doubled. The doubled pawns on the rook's file (Position 339) are especially weak and devalued.
[diagram]
White's castled position is severely weakened in Diagram 340, where diagonals are open and hostile pieces may settle on the squares f3 and g4. An even worse case is the completely open position in Diagram 341 , where the king is unprotected against attacks either on the diagonals or along the second rank. In both examples the advanced pawns can easily be attacked by hostile ones and become disconnected, isolated. 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1
[diagram]
Some pawns, then, are weak in themselves - such as isolated, doubled and backward ones. Their weakness stems from the fact that 2 1 6 Th e Soviet Chess Primer if attacked, they cannot be defended by other pawns. Hence in order to defend them, pieces of much greater value have to be diverted, cramping their freedom of action. It stands to reason that such pawns must be recognized as weak points of the position. Other weak points are squares that have been weakened by pawn moves - as was shown in the foregoing diagrams. As a rule, the squares beside and in front of an isolated pawn are weak. Squares no longer under the control of pawns are weak because they offer the possibility of a lasting and often dangerous invasion by the enemy pieces. It must be stated as a general proviso that weak points cannot always be exploited, which means that in many cases a weakness has no practical importance. In plenty of other cases, however, the presence of weak points in a position brings woeful consequences, as we shall show by examples from practical games. In addition we shall see that not only individual squares but also whole groups of them (square complexes) can be weak. We are already familiar with examples of weak seventh and eighth ranks, or weak files along which an invasion by major pieces takes place. But there are also positions where squares of one or the other colour (light squares or dark squares) are weak. Diagram 83 may serve as an example.
2. PIECE CONFIGURATION -
TEMPORARY AND PERMANENT
WEAKNESSES
If a bad pawn formation sometimes makes for enduring and irreparable weaknesses in the position, then a poor arrangement of the pieces - more mobile units than pawns - gives rise in most cases to temporary weaknesses which can also become very dangerous if you don't attend to eliminating them. Pieces have to possess mobility; they have to be active and work concertedly in the interests of attack and defence. If this rule is broken, weaknesses in the position can arise. Cases where one player's development is retarded or not fully effective are extremely common in practice. It can naturally be very hard to conduct the fight if several of your pieces are still on their starting squares while your opponent's development has progressed a long way. In such cases, the side that lags in development will have too few combat-ready pieces to pit against the active forces of the enemy. Chigorin - Shabelsky, Corr. 1 884-5
[diagram]
White to move White is a pawn down, but he has a certain lead in development over his opponent; furthermore his pieces are much more actively placed than Black's. Nonetheless White's own development is still not completed, and he has some difficulties to face. His pawn on e5 is under attack. He cannot bring his knight out from b l , owing to ... Bxc3. There is of course no doubt about White's positional advantage. Like any advantage in development, it can be expressed in terms of time - in terms of a number of moves - and it has to be utilized without delay. If White continues quietly and slowly, his temporary advantage may vanish like smoke; Black Chapter 6 - Positional Play 217 may succeed in bringing up his pieces to the defence, and then his extra pawn will tell. In such situations you have to select the most energetic moves. Where should White direct his strike? The choice is fairly simple - Black's castled position is almost bereft of defensive pieces.

White to move The characteristic feature of this position is the pawn on d6 - the "wedge" that White has driven into Black's formation. By playing ... c6 (aiming to continue with ...d5), Black weakened the d6-point, and a white pawn has established itself there, hampering the development of Black's entire queenside for the long term. The black kingside has also been weakened by the move ...g5. White's positional advantage more than compensates for the pawn minus. There is just one circumstance that calls for attention. White's centre pawns are too far advanced, they have detached themselves from their base; in themselves they are weakened, and the blockading square e6 is under Black's control. The question to be asked is whether Black will succeed in destroying these pawns in the coming struggle. We should note that weaknesses "in themselves" are of no importance if the opponent cannot make use of them. What cannot be attacked is not weak. Take a look, for instance, at Diagram 93 (page 67). There Black's pawns are just as weak as White's. But there is nothing to attack them, and so speaking of their weakness is simply not called for. If White's bishop were the light-squared one, the weakness of Black's pawns would be obvious. In Position 343 which we are examining, Black will have to devote many moves to defence before he can realistically think about attacking White's centre pawns. At the moment they are strong, not weak. All the same, the position is such as to require White to conduct a victorious attack, as otherwise the pawns will prove weak at the end of the day.

A fine model of powerful cooperation between the pieces! 1-0 Backwardness in development is not the only reason why the other side may acquire a large positional plus. It quite often happens that while both players have brought out the same number of pieces, one side is in a less active or cramped position.
[diagram]
White's pieces are arranged on five ranks, Black's on three. White's position is freer. It's easier for him to manoeuvre with his pieces, since he controls more space. Although cramped, Black's formation would be solid enough if it were not for the weakening of his castled position due to the move ... g6. For the moment, the weak squares f6 and h6 are covered by the bishop on g7. White may therefore adopt the plan of '%!fd2 and then i.h6. It would not pay Black to capture on h6, as after '%!rxh6 and lt:lg5 there would be a threat of mate on h7. Black would prefer the exchange to be carried out by White (hg7 <:Jlxg7), but in any case, with the departure of Black's dark-squared bishop, the squares f6 and h6 would be weakened still further; in some circumstances the manoeuvre lt:lc3-e4-f6 would be possible. If necessary Black could give extra protection to f6 and h6 by playing ... lt:lg8, but he would be condemned to defend while White could pursue active play. The bishop's manoeuvre to h6 can be made into an integral part of some broader game plan for White, beginning (for example) with a strengthening of the centre ('%!rd2, "'J,ad1). White has vastly greater freedom ofaction than Black. His pieces are more actively placed; the initiative is in his hands. Let us now look at some positions of a different type: Euwe - Keres, World Championship (1 1) Hague/Moscow 1 948

In typical fashion White has concentrated his forces against the backward pawn on d7. True, this pawn is sufficiently defended, but the blockade against it is disrupting Black's communication between the two flanks. The rook on h6, for instance, cannot be brought across to defend the queenside (compare Diagram 346). Nor can ... Rd8 be played for that purpose, owing to tt'lxe6.

White to move With the white rooks arranged as they are, this position rather recalls the previous one; but here (with the endgame stage already reached), the blockade of the e6-pawn is virtually the sole focus of the play. Winning this pawn is perhaps the only way - the most convenient one, at any rate - for White to realize his advantage, material and positional. How can he accomplish this task? White has no more pieces to hand for the additional attack on e6 which the situation demands. As a rule in such cases, the decisive blow will be struck by a pawn.

They merely elucidate some key factors on which positional play is based: the exploitation of weaknesses permanent and temporary, and also the use that can be made of an active position when your opponent is behind in development, or when his pieces are deployed to little effect or downright badly.
3. THE CENTRE (PAWN CENTRE AND
PIECE CENTRE)
One of the basic strategic principles of chess, as we indicated before on page 1 05, is to centralize the pieces, to control the centre, or at least to occupy just as solid and strong a position there as our opponent. "The centre" is what we call the fairly small area formed by the squares d4, d5, e5 and e4; the "extended centre" is the rather larger area with c3, c6, f6 and f3 at its corners. We can gain possession of the centre by concentrating our pieces and pawns there. The pawns need to be placed in the centre first; they will constitute its foundation, they will take valuable squares away from the opponent and provide our pieces with future outposts; but then the firepower of our pieces must be focused on the centre too. The point of this concentration of forces is that our control of the centre enables us, if we wish, to carry out a breakthrough there by using the storming power of our pawns, or alternatively, under cover of our strong centre, we can start active operations on the flanks - in which case the possibility of rapidly switching pieces from one flank to the other will be very useful. It doesn't pay to occupy the centre with pieces alone, as the enemy pawns will easily drive them away. A centre like that would be unstable. The matter is different if the movement and exchange of pawns causes weak squares (from the opponent's point of view) to be formed. Imagine for example an isolated black pawn on d5; a knight of ours on d4 would then be occupying a very strong central position. It is true that a pure "piece centre" does sometimes come about, but what this involves is not so much occupying the centre with our pieces as subjecting it to their powerful fire; and even then, we will take the first convenient opportunity for a thrust against the enemy pawn centre with one of our own "c-f" pawns. Playing with a "piece centre" can be very difficult and sometimes risky; but the same can also be said of a pure pawn centre. This explains why the "piece-and-pawn" centre is the prevalent type. The ideal arrangement of the centre pawns is on the squares d4 and e4 (for simplicity we will explain things from White's viewpoint only). With such a centre the mobility of the opponent's pieces is significantly restricted; both our bishops have a free route into the open; and the knights can station themselves comfortably on c3 and f3, directing their fire at the central squares. The great advantage of such a centre lies also in its mobility, its assault potential. At any moment, depending on preparation, we may play e4-e5 or d4-d5, initiating an attack. Naturally our opponent will try to attack our pawn centre so as to cause an exchange or a weakening advance of one of the pawns. If the pressure from the opponent's pieces is very strong and promises to increase systematically, our centre will need constant protection. To be truly strong, a pawn centre must be well supported. Let us look at a set of examples illustrating the strength and weakness of a pawn centre in various situations: Chapter 6 - Positional Play 225 Chigorin - Steinitz, London (17) 1 883
[diagram]
Black to move White is a pawn down, but his positional advantage is obvious. Black is behind in development, and his kingside has been weakened by the advance ...g5. At the same time White's pieces are occupying a strong centralized position. He has the "ideal" pawn centre. The question of whether this centre is weak or strong is what interests us first and foremost. When evaluating a position it is always essential to give attention to the presence of threats from one side or the other. White may play 16J!acl, and if 16. .. c6 then 17.lDxb6 axb6 1 8.'Rb4, attacking d6 and b6 and shattering Black's position; but his chief threat lies in preparation for an assault with e4-e5, opening lines against Black's uncastled king. What Black's threats may amount to, we shall presently see.

Pill sbury - Chigorin, St Petersburg (1 1) 1895/6
[diagram]
Black to move White's last move was 7.e4. Outwardly this move looks good. But will White's pawn centre be strong in the absence of adequate support from his pieces? Would 7.e3 perhaps have been more cautious and better? To these questions Chigorin gives a clear-cut answer. 7 ... .Bb4 8.f3 Owing to the pin, the knight on c3 is no longer defending the e4-pawn, but now the latter would seem adequately guarded. 8 ... £5! After this hard-hitting blow, it emerges that the point e4 is indefensible. There is no use in 9.Wfd3 owing to 9 . ..lLif6, after which White's queen is only blocking the path of his own bishop. White is only left with the choice between 9.exf5 and 9.e5, both of which mean a significant weakening of his pawn centre.

Owing to the threat of ... lt:lxd2 followed by ... .Bc4 t, White cannot avoid further material losses. Black soon won. ...0-1 So at move 7, White would have done better with the modest 7.e3. After 7.e4, his pawn centre quickly collapsed as a result of his opponent's shattering blows. Black first weakened it, then destroyed it. Of course, a major role in all this was played by the strong position of Black's bishop on c6. Chapter 6 - Positional Play 227 If we imagine a position like Diagram 354 only with this bishop on c8, then White's advantage is obvious. Generally speaking, a situation where White has one centre pawn on e4 or d4, facing a black pawn on d6 or e6 respectively, represents a form of central advantage that is rather commoner in practice than the "ideal" centre. The advantage lies in the unrestricted mobility of the bishops and in White's greater freedom of action. Configurations of pawns in the centre are in practice extremely varied. In the main, your own and your opponent's pawns will be blocking each other, and a kind of balance of forces in the centre will be established. If, however, the pawns acquire freedom, then a pawn centre well supported by pieces will often become very dangerous (see Diagram 355). Kotov - Lilienthal, Moscow 1 944

White's two active bishops gave powerful support to the advance of his pawns, while the black rooks, lacking open files, were wholly unable to exert their strength. 1-0 Examples of a fight against the opponent's pawn centre will be given further on. For the moment we will look at an example of a "piece centre". Botvinnik - Lilienthal, Leningrad 1 94 1
[diagram]
White to move Neither side has pawns in the centre, but all the central squares are under fire from white and black pieces. It isn't easy to ascertain who has the advantage in this sector. The point d5 of course belongs to White, but the black pieces clearly have the squares e4 and especially e5 under their control. However, if we also take the pawn configuration into account, we can identify a certain advantage on White's side. The pawn on d6, in fact, although performing some services for Black in his fight for the centre, is nonetheless slightly cramping him. But the main thing is that Black's kingside has been weakened. The bishop on f5, for example, is a piece he should not exchange off, as the g6- pawn would then become weak. Black's last move was 1 6. ..h5. He was forced to make this weakening move to stop White from playing g3-g4 and then at a suitable moment g4-g5. By driving the black pieces Chapter 6 - Positional Play 229 back from the centre, this would have allowed White to gain the ascendency there and later to establish his pieces there. A series of subtle and complex manoeuvres begins, with the aim of increasing the pressure on the centre squares. 17J!ael '!Rd7 18.�h2 �h7 19 • .Bg5 Making the manoeuvre ltle2-f4-d5 a possibility.

a powerful attack. A classic example of the struggle in a "piece centre". It vividly characterizes the difficulties of such a struggle, which demands far sightedness and manoeuvring skill. 1-0
4. POSITION AND STRENGTH OF THE
PIECES - THE TWO BISHOPS
We have already spoken of how greatly the strength of the pieces is influenced by the position. In the chapter "Tactics and Strategy'' we could see, for example, that if a pawn has reached the penultimate rank and is supported by its king, it sometimes holds out successfully against a queen. We also encountered some more colourful positions in which some weak pieces not only held their own in single combat against much stronger ones, but even overcame them. True, such cases were exceptions, but at the end of the day they were not such rare ones as all that - we need only recall our last chapter, "Combination". The strength of pieces participating in a combination was determined exclusively by their role, that is, by the threats they created. In a combination pieces are sacrificed, sometimes several of them in succession; here the customary measure for the value of the pieces is transformed.
230 The Soviet Chess Primer
But these combinative factors are not what interests us now. It is important to note that even in the positional struggle - which predominates in practice and is determined not by combinations but by manoeuvres - major fluctuations in the strength of the pieces occur very often, albeit not in so striking a form. Depending on the position, the strength of an individual piece may prove to be either above or below what is normal, either temporarily or in the long term. The strength of a piece naturally grows when lines of movement - files or diagonals - are open to it, and also when you succeed in stationing it in the centre of the board. Its strength increases still more when it is creating threats; the more dangerous the threats, the stronger the piece. If a white pawn has advanced to h6, right up to the enemy king's castled position, and if the black g-pawn is missing or has moved to g6, then the white pawn can sometimes have the same effect as a bishop (if for instance threats of mate on g7 or on the eighth rank arise). A knight established inside the opponent's camp may prove equal in strength to a rook. The strength of a piece decreases and falls short of the norm if it is deprived of mobility by obstacles (for instance when bishops are behind pawn chains), or if it is tied to its post for other reasons; or if it is on the edge of the board; and so on. In the section "How the Position Aff ects the Relative Strengths" we saw that a bishop can be sometimes stronger, sometimes weaker, than a knight. We also observed that two bishops, as a rule, are stronger than a bishop and knight or two knights. We saw the immense power of a bishop pair in Positions 355 and 356. Here are some examples illustrating different methods of utilizing "the advantage of the two bishops". Makarov -Vasiukov, Kishinev 1951
[diagram]
Black to move The advantage of the two bishops manifests itself chiefly in their great mobility. They need open diagonals. Hence if White in Position 358 managed to play c3-c4, the bishop on c6 would be shut out of the game and White would obtain excellent drawing chances, seeing that the bishop on a5 cannot create decisive threats on its own. In a very pretty and strategically correct manner, Black forestalls White's c3-c4.

Black to move If in the last example the mobility of the white pieces was restricted by the more freely positioned black ones, the present example shows that the enemy's mobility may also be confined by the encroachment of the pawns, which deprive his pieces of squares and obstruct his lines of action. It's true that when pawns advance they are often weakened as a consequence, but in the presence of the two bishops this is not so dangerous. 16 ... c5 17.lllH3b6 As a result of these moves, the white pieces are deprived of the d4-square. In addition the gl -a7 diagonal is closed to the bishop on e3, while this bishop's movement on the other diagonal is confined by White's own f4-pawn.

Let us now examine a fairly rare case of the knights carrying the day in a struggle of two knights against two bishops.

E:6xg5 White resigned. 0-1 In the skilful hands of Chigorin, who was a master of the art of playing with them, the knights achieved victory. And yet, as we saw, this required some errors from his opponent; otherwise the bishops would have proved their power. "The advantage of the bishop pair" is a firmly established concept in chess theory, even though there is hardly ever any rule without exceptions, in chess or elsewhere. It remains to be noted that if the advantage of the two bishops is usually more pronounced when they face two knights - given that coordinated play with knights involves major difficulties and also requires the presence of pawn barriers - then the advantage of two bishops over a bishop and knight is very often insignificant and may play no role whatever.
5. EVALUATING A POSITION
Let us briefly sum up. In this chapter we have looked at a set of examples which, taken as a whole, give some idea of the nature of the positional struggle. For the overall assessment of a position - as the foregoing material should have made clear to us already - a number of factors have to be taken into account. First ofall, we look at the material distribution of forces. If the forces are unequal (if, say, one side is a pawn down), we decide whether there is any compensation of a positional kind, such as an attack, a superior formation, and so on. In addition we consider the extent and quality of each player's development. How many pieces have been brought out? How they are deployed, how secure are they in their positions? How mobile are they (are open lines and diagonals available)? How active are they (what scope have they for attacking hostile pieces and pawns)? Then we have to assess the situation in the centre, and also in other important sectors of the board where a fight is in progress or starting (for instance the position of the kings, and the pieces and pawns sheltering them). After this we must ascertain the balance of strong and weak points, as well as the possibility of new weaknesses arising. Finally we decide whether there are any threats on either side, how significant they are, and what means of attack and defence are available. It's hard to say exactly in what order this mental process comes together in a chessplayer's consciousness, but all the elements we have mentioned are taken into account without fail. An interesting point here is that notwithstanding the abundance of factors to be considered, an experienced player's overall assessment of a position (without deeper investigation, of course) takes shape very quickly. A striking proof of this is supplied by simultaneous displays in which a master conducts games on twenty-five or thirty boards at great speed. In accordance with his evaluation of the position and the possible variations in it, a player decides on his plan for further action, he selects particular moves and gives this or that direction to the play. For a chessplayer, correct evaluation of the position is fundamental.

Chapter ? How to Begin a Game
1. THE OPENING AND ITS TASKS
The struggle in a game of chess begins right from the first moves. What exactly are we struggling for when playing the opening? What aims are we setting ourselves here? Clearly the first task is to bring the pieces out, to give them squares and lines that enable them to exert their power. In the initial position (see Diagram 1), all the pieces except the knights are wholly deprived of mobility and unable to act in any way against the hostile formation. They must first of all be drawn up in battle order, placed in positions where they can exercise the greatest activity. A piece in the centre of the board has considerably more mobility than in the corner or on the edge. For that reason, as we indicated earlier, it is important to gain control of "the centre". Controlling the centre means either occupying it with our own pawns and pieces or bringing powerful fire from our pieces to bear on it. This is why the best moves for White are l .e4 and l .d4 (or l .c4 which is also sometimes played). In developing the pieces, it is useful to bring them out towards the centre or to arrange them in such a way that they all strike at the centre or threaten the enemy pieces that are trying to defend it. This basic principle of the game should not be understood too narrowly. In practice, depending on our chosen plan, deviations of one sort or another may occur, but only temporary ones. The fundamental idea - to control the centre, or at least to be no less strongly placed in the centre than our opponent - is the thread that runs all the way through the opening. In this connection, what is important is not just the "centre" in the strict sense of the word (the squares e4, d4, e5 and d5), but also the "extended centre", that is the area marked out by the squares c3-c6-f6-f3. The significance of creating a strong centre with pawns (or sometimes pieces), as the basis of an entire positional build-up and with the aim of securing strong points for our pieces to occupy, was already made clear in the chapter on "Positional Play". Common sense suggests that we should try to bring as many pieces into play as possible, so that by their united force we can break down our opponent's resistance or fend off his pressure. A fundamental law of chess strategy states that in order to achieve success at any point on the board, we need to be stronger in that sector than our opponent. We must therefore endeavour to bring all our pieces into the game and not limit ourselves to just a few of them.
242 The Soviet Chess Primer
For successful mobilization, a further requirement is speed: the pieces have to be mobilized without loss of time. At the beginning of the game, as a rule, it is not advisable to move the same piece several times unless this brings some immediate benefits. It is better to bring a new piece into play with every move, so as to complete our development in as few moves as possible. We may say that the initial stage of development is essentially complete when the minor pieces have been brought out and the king has castled. After that, in general, the queen will be brought out to c2/d2/e2 or b3/d3/f3 (depending on circumstances and our overall development plan), in order to establish connection between the rooks and allow them to be brought into the game, that is, stationed on the d-, e-, c- or f-file as required. Naturally the development of the pieces should not be based on any casual notions. A specific development plan must be chosen - the pieces must be brought out according to a certain system, a certain logic, keeping in mind the clear aim that we have set ourselves (the fundamental aim being to secure for our pieces the necessary influence on the centre). In pursuit of our development plan and chosen aim, we should endeavour to deploy as many pieces as possible in the best possible positions within the smallest number of moves. But this is still not all. In conducting the game we are facing an opponent who, of course, is striving after the same thing as we are. If we want to conquer the centre, so does he. Thus from the very first moves, a fight for the centre begins. As the opening proceeds, both sides are aiming not only for development but for an advantage in development (more pieces in play, better positions for them). It is therefore important that we should be concerned not only to develop our own pieces freely but also to hinder our opponent, to make his development as difficult as we can, to slow it down, to make him play moves that weaken his position. Carrying out our own plans, struggling with our opponent's dangerous designs - this is the theme of every game of chess, in any of its phases: opening, middlegame, endgame.
2. CONTROL OF THE CENTRE
SUPERIOR DEVEWPMENT
In Chapter 6 (in the section on "The Centre") we gave examples of a strong and weak pawn centre, while at the same time throwing light on how the centre is fought for, that is, on the efforts of players to create their own centre or destroy that of the enemy. Control of the centre makes it possible for the pieces to develop comfortably and display their strength more fully. Let us look at some examples confirming the kind of benefits that come from superior development with control of the centre and the availability of open lines.
[diagram]
White to move White's positional advantage is obvious. The development of his forces is already complete. He has seized the centre and concentrated his major pieces in the open f-file. Chapter 7 - How to Begin a Game In Black's camp we see a different picture. His queenside pieces are completely undeveloped. His king, which in the course of the play was deprived of its castling rights, is blocking his rook's exit from h8. Black has nothing in play except his queen, and even that piece is compelled to guard the squares f7 and f8 against the threat of mate, so its mobility is limited. But then White does have a piece less, so he is obliged to make use of his positional advantage as quickly as he can, without allowing Black to catch up with him in development. In such positions, a combination is nearly always possible; its idea usually amounts to an opening of lines, so that some new pieces, previously inactive, can take a decisive part in the fight. White achieved his aim with: l.�d5! cxd5 2.e:x:d5 The file was opened up for his rook on e 1 , and Black resigned due to 2 .. . Wfg7 3.E:e8t. If Black hadn't taken the knight, he would have lost his queen with I ...Wfg7 2.tDf6t and
3.lDh5t.

Black to move In Position 362, what strikes you at once is Black's superior development. White's far advanced pawn on e5, isolated and weak, is pinned into the bargain. With his next move Black develops another piece, occupying the open d-file with his rook. l.. . E:d8 The central squares are under fire from the black pieces - Black controls the centre.

It is sometimes possible to concede the centre and after that obtain fully viable and rich prospects for play. Sometimes a player who has abandoned the centre can reconquer it to continue the fight in more favourable conditions. The following example is instructive: Tarrasch - Alekhine, Baden-Baden 1 925

The real point is that he has decided to relinquish the centre with ... exd4 and then, after due preparation, to carry out ...d5. This decision is prompted by the fact that with his queen on e7 Black would have difficulty undertaking anything against White's powerful centre.

3. EXAMPLES OF OPENING PLAY
OPENING MISTAKES
A move frequently seen at the start of the game is l .e4. Other openings generally lead to a more slow-moving game. Beginners should be advised to give preference to l .e4 for a long time, to familiarize themselves with the character of the struggle in the so-called "open games" and acquire certain essential skills. What is the aim of l .e4 ...? The pawn on e4 establishes a strong point in the centre for White's further operations; by moving this pawn he opens lines for his pieces. At this stage we can already formulate the following general plan of development: (I) bring out the minor pieces on the kingside; (2) castle; (3) bring out the minor pieces on the queenside. This of course is an approximate plan, since we need to make allowance for the way our opponent is playing. If he makes a mistake, we attempt to take immediate advantage of it, even if this means going against our development plan. In place of this approximate plan we devise a new specific plan to exploit the opponent's error. If his moves don't seem to us to be errors, we will strictly adhere to the principle of fast development. For this purpose, a beginner should be advised to be sparing with pawn moves at the beginning of the game. The main task, after all, is to develop the pieces; pawn moves usually serve only to open lines and create strong points. For the time being, therefore, the best way to handle the opening is to move only the central e- and d-pawns, letting the bishops out - and not to move any other pawns except in case of necessity. A good answer to l .e4 is l ...e5. This move pursues the same aims as l .e4; it hinders the occupation of the centre by a second white pawn (d2-d4), and blocks the white e4-pawn which might in some circumstances move forward advantageously (although in general you are not recommended to push the central pawns prematurely, especially when they would lose contact with their base and could become weak). After the moves l .e4 e5, in accordance with the plan already outlined, White can bring out the knight on gl or the bishop on fl . In general terms, these moves are of equal worth; however, unless your development plan is affected in some specific way, it is considered better to bring out the knights first, then the bishops. The point is that the knight has essentially no choice of moves. If we play
2.ltle2, we are blocking the bishop's exit. The
move 2.ltlh3 is bad because on the edge of the board the knight's mobility is restricted. Clearly the best developing move for the king's knight will usually be 2.ltlf3. With the bishop it is another matter. Depending on how the Chapter 7 - How to Begin a Game 247 game continues, the bishop may go to c4 or b5, or sometimes to d3 ifWhite has played d2- d4 first. It is therefore better not to limit the bishop's possibilities in advance but to move it later. So we will play 2.ll'lf3. The fact that this stops the queen from coming out is immaterial - we were not intending an immediate queen move anyway. It will be a while before that piece does move. Let us state from the outset that unless the queen is intervening in the fight in a decisive manner, moves made with it at the start of the game are not to be recommended; in the face of attacks from less valuable pieces, the queen will be forced to lose time retreating, thus furthering the opponent's development. Now Black needs to defend his pawn on e5. He can do this in various ways, but not all of them are good. Thus, 2 ... .Bd6 prevents the d7 -pawn from moving and holds up the development of the queenside. There could follow 3 . .Bc4 ll'lf6
4.d4, after which White has a fine, free game,
while Black is cramped. If 4 ... exd4?, then 5.e5 Wie7 6.Wie2, winning a piece. Or if 4 ... ll'lxe4?, then 5.dxe5 .i� 6.Wid5. Moves with the queen, 2 ... Wie7 or 2 ... Wif6, also hinder the development of Black's own pieces and involve a loss of tempo, if not immediately then later. For example, 2 ... Wie7
3.ll'lc3 c6 4 . .Bc4 with the better game for
White. Or 2 ... Wif6 3 . .Bc4 (so as to castle without delay), and if now 3 ... Wig6 4.O-O Wixe4?, then 5 . .Bxf7t. Black cannot capture with 5 .. .'�xf7 in view of 6.ll'lg5t, while after 5 ...me7 or 5 ...md8 White plays 6.1:'!:e l , winning the e5-pawn with the better position; to add to his troubles, Black has lost the right to castle. Of course, the play doesn't have to go exactly like this. The important thing to grasp is simply that bringing the queen out early contradicts the principles of opening development and often has adverse results. Defending with 2 .. . £6 is another typical beginner's mistake. This move is wrong for several reasons. It offends against the principles of normal development; as we know already, it suits our purpose better if the centre pawns are the only ones moved in the opening. The pawn on f6 deprives the knight on g8 of its best square. In addition the point f7, which at the start of the game is defended only by the king, is now weakened still further, since the diagonals a2-g8 and e8-h5 are opened up for the white pieces. White can exploit this weakness with 3 . .Bc4, continuing to develop his pieces normally and at the same time making it hard for Black to do so, as the bishop is preventing him from castling short. Against any reply from his opponent, White maintains the freer and better game. An interesting and sharp attempt to refute 2 ...f6 is the knight sacrifice 3.ll'lxe5. Black loses quickly if he accepts the sacrifice. For example: 3 ... fxe5 4.Wih5t me7 5.Wixe5t mf7 6.Bc4t d5 (6 ...mg6 7.Wif5t mh6 8.d4t g5 9.h4! leads to mate) 7.hd5t mg6 8.h4, and Black is helpless against the threats of h5t mh6, d4t or Axb7 Bxb7, Wif5t. A better reply to 3.ll'lxe5 is 3 ... Wie7, after which it would be wrong to play 4.Wih5t g6 5.ll'lxg6 in view of 5 ... Wixe4t, winning the knight. White should continue
4.ll'lf3 Wixe4t 5.Be2 with the better game, as
Black is badly behind in development (he will lose another tempo after ll'lc3, while White threatens O-O and E:e 1) and the weakness resulting from ...f6 has not been eliminated. The answers to 2.ll'lf3 that we have so far examined were clearly bad. From analysing continuations that were more worthy of attention, chess theorists came to the conclusion that a better defence was 2 ...d6, although this too is not free of defects, since the pawn on d6 obstructs the path of the bishop on f8. They further concluded that
248 The Soviet Chess Primer
2 ... ltlf6 (defending by counter-attacking) was fully satisfactory, but that 2 ... ltlc6 should be acknowledged as the best defence, since with this move Black in his turn brings a piece into play and maintains the essential balance of forces in the centre. In like manner, theory has established that on his third move White has a number of perfectly acceptable continuations, but that the richest in possibilities and strongest (and at any rate the most logical) is 3 . .Bb5 - the so called 'Ruy Lopez' or Spanish game - whereby he intensifies the pressure against the central point e5 that began with 2.ltl8. At this stage we will not go more deeply into the theory of l .e4 e5 2.ltl8 or of any other sample opening, but will merely concentrate on the question of opening errors. We have so far given examples of some weak moves and gross errors that are made, if at all, in beginners' games. An experienced chessplayer will never commit such offences against the principles of normal opening development. In practice, however, we come across cases where errors in the opening are not so blatant. These include the typical case of an unobtrusive loss of tempo, sometimes resulting from an exchange. As an example we will take a game played by Morphy (White) in the middle of the nineteenth century: I.e4 e5 2.�6 d6 3.d4 .Bg4 Black doesn't want to surrender the centre with 3 ...exd4, but that being so, he should have played 3 ... ltld7. The move chosen is a good deal weaker.

It is now obvious that White has gained a tempo: he has not only brought a piece out - it is also his turn to move. This came about because the black queen's bishop used up two moves to capture the knight on 8 which had only made one; while in recapturing on f3 with his queen, White was simultaneously making a developing move. White has thus gained a certain advantage, and after some fresh mistakes by his opponent he won quickly. An error frequently seen in the opening is premature activity, which means any kind of attack with incomplete development and insufficient support for aggressive undertakings (the game Belavenets - Lisitsyn, which we quote in the next chapter, should suffice as an example; see also Position 455). With good attentive play, even slight violations of the basic development principles can be convincingly exploited. The most widespread type of opening errors are those where a player gives insufficient attention to some special features of the piece configuration. In many openings there are various "reefs" on which you can easily be "shipwrecked" if you examine the variations superficially, trusting that the position is harmless or not very complex. This is where unexpected and devastating moves from the opponent are a possibility. Chapter 7 - How to Begin a Game 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 Fine - Yudovich, Moscow 1 937

8.d4?! �xd4 8.�xd4 exd4 9.�xd4?
Now Black will continue with 9 ... c5 and 1 0. ..c4, winning the bishop on b3. Such mistakes are often called opening traps. This is not always accurate. A trap, after all, is characterized by "bait", and the only thing that can be viewed as a bait here (in a decidedly relative sense) is perhaps White's desire to open the diagonal for his bishop on cl and to use the advance of his d-pawn to assault the centre. Compare the following example of a genuine trap. This position arises after the opening moves l .e4 e5 2.tLlf3 tLlc6 3.i.b5 tLlf6 4.d3 tLle7. Black's last move intends to post the knight on g6 before developing the other pieces. However, it appears to leave the e5-pawn undefended.
5.�xe5? c6!
The trap is sprung! If White retreats his bishop, then 6 ... 1Wa5t wins the knight on e5.
250 The Soviet Chess Primer
Once they have been "invented", opening traps and pitfalls such as the ones given above become the property of theory, which in its analysis of diverse variations warns the student about the possibility of such "shocks". Knowing about them is a good thing of course, but an even safer approach is to work out the variations carefully for yourself, especially when "bait" is being offered. In this chapter we have given some elementary information on the opening. To acquire a better grasp of the general principles of opening development that we have set out here, you should once again carefully play through all the short games that were given before (at the end of each chapter). These games are especially instructive because they show one side committing patent errors in the opening, whereupon the other side succeeds in exploiting those errors vividly and convincingly - in most cases with the aid of sharp tactical strokes and pretty combinations.

PROBLEMS THAT ARE "NO JOKE"
The problems given below are entertaining and not lacking in humour, although undoubtedly their authors did not mean to "have a joke" in every case. You may have a try at solving them for yourself However, solving difficult problems with variations many moves long is often no joking matter. For that reason we are appending the solutions straight away, especially since there are some interesting stories to be told about some of them. 1 Slowly but surely J. Kohtz and C. Kockelkom, 1 896

A crazy path

Mate in 4 moves It has to be said straight away that solving this problem is very difficult. When someone starts showing you the solution, a feeling of bewilderment comes over you - either you are being "led up the garden path", or there is something not quite normal about that other person. Suppose he is taciturn and just confines himself to making the moves on the board; you on the other hand are anything but taciturn, and bestow some sort of commentary on each of White's moves. Then your peculiar "dialogue-monologue" might go somewhat as follows: l.�a2 "Oh, come now!" (In astonishment.) "You mean to say that's the shortest way to mate! Well, well ..." (Now a little worried, but trying not to show it.) "Tell me, though - how have you been feeling lately? Have you been having any headaches?" I.. .d4 2.�a5 "I see, I see!"

Chapter 7 - How to Begin a Game 259 "Excelsior" S. Loyd, 1 86 1 The Latin word excelsior is usually translated as "eminent", but although this problem is indeed eminent, Loyd had no wish at all to be immodest. Another meaning of excelsior is "striving higher". The heading of the problem corresponds to the title and refrain of a poem popular in America, Longfellow's ballad of the young Alpine climber. The appositeness of the heading is obvious: in the course of the solution the b2-pawn reaches the highest summit, the square a8. Subsequently, other composers were to produce quite a few chess problems on this same theme of "the pawn's triumphal procession". The solution goes: a b c d e f g h I.b4! Mate in 5 moves The distinguished American problemist Samuel Loyd ( 1 84 1 - 1 9 1 1 ) thought up this problem as a joke. One of his friends, himself a composer of chess problems, was in the habit of betting that when shown any problem he could always tell in advance which piece was going to give mate in the main variation. Setting up the diagram position in front of his friend, Loyd said: "I'd like to put the question differently. Look the problem over in your usual way, and say which of the pieces can't give mate." "Mate with the b2-pawn would be the most unlikely," came the quick reply. "You can see from the solution which of us won the bet," Loyd would tell people afterwards. Threatening E:f5. l.. .

For further problems and studies, see the Appendix, where the special section "Chess Compositions" is devoted to them. Chapter 8 The Endgame
1. BASIC IDEAS OF THE ENDGAME
With the onset of the endgame, there is normally a radical change in the general character of the play. Dashing attacks against the king, threats of mate, sharp tactical blows - these are all things of the past. The king no longer needs to be constantly defended by its pieces and can take an active part in the game. To make no use of the king would even be foolish; in many cases it would mean playing under unequal conditions, with a piece less. The endgame further alters the power and importance of the pawns, given the possibility of queening them more easily. The strength of other pieces also grows, thanks to the increase in their mobility and sphere of action. The rooks start to be especially active, after earlier operating only in a small number of open files. Of course, in the distinctive small-scale war of the pieces that constitutes the endgame, the basic principles of strategy and tactics that we set out earlier remain in full force. In the endgame any forms of restriction on mobility, and conversely any open lines for active piece play, actually gain in significance; the overall reduction in the number of pieces sometimes makes these factors decisive. Various types of weakness in the position are also apt to tell more acutely in the endgame stage. The general aims of the players in the endgame remain unchanged - to exploit a material or positional advantage if you have one, or to endeavour to acquire one if you have not. The queening of pawns - that special type of material gain - is a basic and highly characteristic target of endgame play. It is round this target that the battle flares up; it is in pursuit of this aim that attacks on weak pawns are undertaken, and pawn breakthroughs organized. Players employ the full arsenal of devices, all the typical precepts: centralizing the pieces, especially the king (this is less important for the long-range pieces, rook and bishop); cramping the mobility of your opponent's pieces, and securing maximum activity for your own; and also applying such characteristic concepts as a gain of tempo, zugzwang, triangulation, corresponding squares, and so on. Despite the limited material left on the board and the appearance of simplicity, endgames incorporate a boundless variety of specific ideas and subtleties ofvarious kinds. Playing an endgame often demands exceptional accuracy, when you need to attend to the minutest peculiarities of the position and take every tempo into account. It must be stressed that in the endgame a player's very mode of thinking is in some way modified. If tactics - the calculation of concrete

variations, threats, combinations - was of great importance in the middlegame, then strategy - the general plan for attaining the goal with the appropriate formation of pieces - acquires paramount significance in the endgame; elaboration of the plan by concrete calculation plays a subordinate role here. The endgame is by nature positional. If in the middlegame much depends on the players' imagination, in the endgame logic comes right to the fore. It must not of course be claimed that this holds good for all types of endgame (exceptionally sharp positions, combinations and tactical strokes are met with in endgames too), but it does in the majority of cases. Combinations in the endgame often have a special, distinctive character, for their aim differs from the usual ones of mate or the win of material. In what follows, we shall more than once be able to verify this from a series of examples (the next two alone will suffice) . We are already familiar with cases where a passed pawn is obtained by means of a breakthrough. Here is another interesting example: Zubarev - Grigoriev, Leningrad 1 925

It's clear that this break is Black's only chance. But what comes afterwards is totally unexpected, and shows how accurately such apparently simple positions need to be calculated.

A factor of immense significance in the endgame is an �ctive, aggressive piece formation facing the opponent's passive, defensive one.

White to move Black's freedom of action is curtailed by the need to defend his weak pawns on c6 and h5. It's easy to see that he is in a zugzwang position: if it were his turn to move here, he would lose the game at once with 1 . . . J.f7 2.J.xc6 hc4

J.d7 leads us to the main variation. In such cases, as we already know, the task is to gain a tempo - to hand the move to the opponent. Here the tempo gain is achieved thanks to the fact that the bishop on f3 has three squares at its disposal for manoeuvring (f3, g2, hi), while the bishop on e8 has only two (d7, e8). The ensuing play is now easy to understand: t..lg2 J.d7 2.J.h1 J.es l . ..'�g6 and 2 ... 'it>h6 would have led to the same position; Black has no king moves other than these, since he has to guard the g5-square against an invasion by the white king. 3 . .ta The aim is achieved. 3 ... .ld7 4.J.xh5 J.cS 5 . .le8 .lb7 6.J.d7 <i!?g6 After losing the pawn, Black is once again in

.Ba8 l l. .Bc8 With the b7-square taken away from it, the bishop in the corner of the board is "dead and buried"; White gains possession of the point e5, and wins. We will now give a related example that interests us in two respects. First, it shows how much easier an endgame becomes if you are acquainted with the idea of endings of a similar type; secondly, it shows that knowing the general idea is not in itself sufficient, since every position demands careful consideration of its concrete particulars. 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 Post - Leonhardt, Berlin 1 907

Black is in zugzwang. 1-0 We have now seen a few examples clearly reflecting many fundamental ideas that are common to different types of endgame, regardless of the material participating in the struggle. At the same time we have seen that each class of fighting material in the endgame comes with its own peculiarities and typical measures, its specific ideas. The more we find out about these, the more fully we will master the art of endgame play.
2. REALIZING AN ADVANTAGE
As already indicated, the basic task in an endgame is to conduct to victory the advantage you have acquired in the middlegame, or to achieve a draw if the game is heading in the direction of a loss. The decisive factor is usually the presence of passed pawns and the measures taken to force them through to queen. The first rule that the student should learn is not to act with any unnecessary haste in the Chapter 8 - The Endgame 265 exploitation of an advantage. It is far more important, if circumstances permit, to prepare the ground first, to increase your positional assets, to strengthen your position as a whole by a suitable arrangement of your pieces. After that, the exploitation will proceed more safely and with fewer attendant difficulties. Let us examine the following interesting and highly instructive example.
[diagram]
White to move White has an undoubted positional advantage: his outside passed b-pawn is more dangerous than Black's e-pawn. In such situations, the beginner's first impulse is to start pushing his pawn at once. But playing that way is often incorrect, for example: l .b4 @f7 2.b5? @e6 3.b6? @d5
4.b7? .Bd6 5 . .Be3 .Bb8; Black has succeeded
in centralizing his king, and draws easily with 6 ... )f;c6. He would have more trouble drawing in the event of 4 . .Be3 .Bd6! 5.@d3, but the centralization of his king still gives him good chances to defend successfully. The correct method of play for White is to begin by improving his position and constricting his opponent. l.Bc3 .Bd6 On f6 the bishop would be no stronger than a pawn and could not hinder the white b-pawn's advance. White now centralizes his king and ties Black down by pressurizing the e5-point.

It remains to conduct the final part of the ending, that is, to find the correct plan for the further play. Usually everything in an endgame is decided by strategic plans. But here the calculation of concrete variations also starts to play an important role. 8 . .Bb2 Thanks to this waiting move White will again be able to advance his pawn. Of course, such a committal step has to be precisely worked out: 8 ... .Bd6 9.b6 .ibs 10.b7 .Bd6 ll. .Ba3 .Bc7 On l l ... .Bb8 White plays 1 2.Bc5! at once, putting Black in zugzwang.

266 The Soviet Chess Primer
plan has to be of just this nature - gradual and methodical, eliminating any risk of a draw and any risk that a tedious calculation of obscure variations will be needed. In this last respect, the following example is characteristic: Botvinnik - Thomas, Nottingham 1 936
[diagram]
White to move In this amusing position, if White gives up his knight for two pawns (lLlf5-h4xf3 and �xf3), we arrive at a study by Horwitz and Kling ( 1 8 5 1 ) , in which White has to exchange pawns gradually and reach a "two against one" endgame (see Diagram 207 on page 1 17) ; with precise manoeuvring, this endgame is a win. Botvinnik did not give up his knight, but essentially his winning method proved to be more "study-like":
63.<i>f4! <i>bs 64.<i>e5 <i>c8 65.�e6 <i>bs
66.<i>d7 <.!?aS 67.�g3! <i>bs 68./llfl <.!?as
69.<i>c8!
Black resigned, as he would have to play ... f2, after which White would pick up this pawn with his king (while keeping his extra knight) . Annotators were surprised that Botvinnik had chosen what might seem a relatively leisurely path; they didn't consider that in reality this was the quickest way to force the opponent's resignation. 1-0 Naturally the method of exploiting an advantage depends on the character of the position in each individual case. We also come across situations where we need to look for a combinative solution to the problem. 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1

Now consider a few more examples of how typical advantages are exploited. They involve various distributions of material. Chapter 8 - The Endgame 267 Quite often in the endgame you need to exploit the advantage of the exchange - the advantage of a rook over a minor piece. The basic idea of such endings is to open up lines (or utilize those already opened) for your rook to invade the opponent's camp, with the aim of winning enemy pawns and creating a passed pawn for yourself. Levenfish - Freiman, Leningrad 1 934

The first stage is completed - lines have been opened up for the rook. White now conducts an attack against the weak points d5 and h?, with the aim of acquiring a passed pawn.

Black resigned. 1-0 With no pawns on the board, a rook wins against a bishop only in exceptionally favourable positions, of which Diagram 26 (on page 25) may serve as an example (see also Diagrams 4 1 2 and 414 below). If the side with the bishop has dangerous passed pawns, the exchange is sometimes insufficient to win; there can even be cases where the player with the rook loses.

The king has been "shielded" from the checks, and White wins. 1-0 Chapter 8 - The Endgame 271 It should be observed that winning the rook endgame with an extra pawn was not difficult in this case, since the black king was a long way from the pawn. In general, though, one extra pawn in a rook endgame does not win. Naturally there are many exceptions, but we shall explore all this in the next section - "Theoretical Endgames". We shall shortly see some examples of exploiting an advantage with other distributions of material. For the present, apart from some acquaintance with the tactical power of various pieces, the essential thing has been to grasp three methods of exploitation - by systematic positional pressure, by combinative play, or through consistent simplification, that is the transition to simpler positions from complex ones. Of course, in practice these methods may combine with each other and supplement each other. The need for great care when exploiting an advantage is especially worth remembering. In a game between two First Category players in Moscow 1 924, the following position arose. (The author, I am afraid, was playing Black.)

or two knights, the weaker side often seeks salvation by exchanging off all the pawns, as in that case the remaining forces are inadequate to mate. Nimzowitsch - Rubinstein, Carlsbad 1 9 1 1

At this juncture the knight is the key to the whole situation: an exchange on f6 is impossible, and in due course the white king will penetrate via d6. Another possibility for defence in the endgame is to try to bring about a position with bishops of opposite colours, since in this case the presence of one or even more extra pawns can be insufficient to win. 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1

Later on we shall acquaint ourselves with some further resources (methods) for the defence which can complicate the task of exploiting an advantage.
3. THEORETICAL ENDGAMES
The most characteristic feature of Example 38 1 was the skilfully applied method of simplifYing the game - the logical transition, step by step, to simpler positions, leading finally to an endgame of the simplest category of all,a so-called "theoretical" endgame which has been studied before in precise detail. In practice, complex endgames (complex not in the sense of difficulty but merely in the sense of including several pieces) constantly tend to be converted into theoretical ones of this type, as a result of gradual simplification. You can easily understand how important it is to know these theoretical endgames in advance - to know whether they are won or drawn. Armed with this knowledge, we avoid going into one kind of endgame and try to reach a different one that is more favourable to us. We are faced, then, with the need to study various types of theoretical endgame featuring various combinations of pieces on each side. In what follows, we demonstrate a number of theoretical endgames that are of great significance in practice. In so doing, of course, we are far from supposing that we have managed to include even the most important endgames in their totality, given that the richness of chess is truly inexhaustible. To avoid repeating ourselves, we are only giving endgames which either don't occur at all in other parts of this book, or are only mentioned there in passing. The examples are all grouped according to the remaining types of material (pawn endings, bishop or knight endings, and so on) and in ascending order of difficulty. Rook endings, which are the type most often seen in practice, are presented in greater detail and are placed right at the end of this section. Many pawn endings are already known to us. Here are a few more positions. (Unless otherwise stated, it is always White to move from the diagram.)
274 The Soviet Chess Primer

White wins, whichever side is to move White's queenside pawns are still unmoved, so he will always be able to block the enemy ones, after which the white king will penetrate to f6 or d6. It isn't hard to work out how the pawns should be handled to ensure that the final move on the queenside will be made by White. Black will then be compelled to move his king, opening a path for the white king towards the right or left. This example illustrates the advantage of holding the "near opposition". (Possession of the "distant" opposition, and its conversion into the "near" or normal type, were themes elucidated in Chapter 4; see Exercise 7 and its solution on pages 1 60 and 163.) 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1

White wins The endgame in Diagram 393 deserves close attention: l.�g5 �fl 2.�h6 �g8 After this, White advances his pawns to h5 and g5 and then plays g5-g6. Black in the meantime will have been playing ...�g8-h8-g8 etc. We can easily see that White wins if g5-g6 is carried out when the black king is on h8; for then ...�g8 is met by g6-g7 (without check) ...�fl �xh7. If on the other hand g6-g7 occurs with check, then after ... �g8 the game is a draw. In Position 393 as it stands, White wins. But with a different arrangement of the white pawns - with one of them still on its starting Chapter 8 - The Endgame square - the question whether to move it one or two squares forward, in order eventually ro play g5-g6 with the black king on h8, would have to be precisely worked out. In such cases you can conveniently be guided by the so-called "colour rule": if the kings are on the same colour of squares (�h6 - �h8), then the connected pawns need to be on the same colour as each other; if the kings are on opposite colours (�h6 - �g8), the same needs ro be true of the pawns. We could see this in Example 393; now take a different example (altering the position of the white pawns) and satisfY yourself that by observing this rule White does indeed achieve the win (without first having to calculate the whole sequence of moves). As we have seen already from plenty of examples, the manoeuvring of the kings and the exact calculation of every tempo are of decisive importance when playing pawn endgames. In practice, an extra pawn in a pure pawn endgame almost always guarantees victory. If there are many exceptions in the case of a lone pawn or two against one, the chances of converting an extra pawn into a win are much increased when the number of pawns is greater - unless of course the king and pawns are in some particularly bad position. Let us turn to endgames with bishops on the same-coloured or opposite-coloured squares.

Not an entirely accurate move, as we shall later see. 2 ••• J.h3 3.i.a6 <!>d6 4. <!>b7 <!>c5 A characteristic ploy for the defence: Black brings his king round to station it in vertical opposition - that is, with 'i!tb6 versus the white king on b8 - which suits him best here. If instead he played 4 ... .Bg4 5.'i!tb8 .Bh3, leaving the kings in diagonal opposition, White's win would be simpler - since the black bishop could easily be driven off the diagonal a6-c8 by 6 . .Bc8 .ifl 7 . .Bg4 .Ba6 8 . .Be2. 5. <!>bs <!>b6 6 • .Bc8 .tg2 Or 6 ... -ifl 7 . .Bg4 .Ba6 8 . .i8 'i!tc5 9 . .Bb7. 7 •.Bg4 .Bb7 8 . .Be2! Zugzwang! 8 ... <!>c6 9.i.f3t White wins. We have given all the moves of the solution as set out in endgame handbooks, in order to underline the significance of the vertical opposition. Admittedly it didn't help Black here, as there were only three squares on the short diagonal (a6-c8), and the bishop was unable to retreat along it; but in an analogous position with a centre pawn, Black would draw. That is why the flank pawns give better winning chances (compare this with the solution to Position 376 on page 266). From Diagram 395 White can win more quickly with accurate play (not allowing Black to place himself in vertical opposition), thus: I.i.f3 <!>e5 2.<!>a7! <!>d6 3.<!>b8 .lh3 4 •.lb7 <!>c5 5 • .lc8 i.f1 6.i.g4 i.a6 7.i.e2 White wins. With bishops of opposite colours, one pawn as a rule fails to win. Even with two pawns the win is not always possible. Let's begin with cases where the pawns are connected. The basic means of defence is to sacrifice the bishop for both of them. 8 7 6 5 4 3

It isn't difficult to grasp that in a position with all these pieces shifted one file to the right (White <it>b2, lLld4 versus Black <it>gl , 8g2) White must lose, as there is no square analogous to h2 for his knight. With one sole pawn on the board, the player rarely succeeds in queening it if he only has a bishop against a knight or, conversely, a knight against a bishop. Exceptions are possible when the king of the weaker side doesn't control the queening square or is driven away from it.
282 The Soviet Chess Primer
We will confine ourselves to two examples; to some extent they show the typical features of such cases with either the bishop or the knight on the winning side.

White wins Winning the endgame in Diagram 406 is far from simple. In the first place, the bishop has to keep control of the f6-square (otherwise Black draws with ... tt'lf6t, ... tt'le8t); and at the same time, it has to place the black king in zugzwang. White gains nothing from l..i e5 <j;Jb6! (not l ...<j;Jb5? 2 . .Bd4) 2 . .Bd4t <j;Jb5, and the bishop has no good waiting move.

In Position 408, with the pawn still not far advanced, there are various ways for White to win easily, even though his king is in an unfavourable position (the basic idea consists of bringing the white king to the b-file).

(If the pawns have reached the 6th rank, they usually no longer need the king's support.) The following position, demonstrated by the author in 1 939, is an instructive example. In practice it could come about after White had given up his rook for a dangerous pawn on a2. 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1

In such situations it is often better to push the pawn that is closer to the centre, for this means that the h-pawn will be the only one vulnerable to the black king - and it is the one further away from it.

A mistake would be 7.h6 �f5 8.h7?, owing to 8 ... 13hl with a draw. If in the diagram position we transfer the white king to f3, then after l .g5 Black demonstrates a draw at once with l ... l:!h2. An interesting point is that even with the king on f4, which looks more favourable to White, the position is again drawn: l .g5 13f2t! (an important intermediate check; if l ...l:!h2? at once, then
2.g6!). Now after 2.�e5 or �e4 there follows
2 ... 13h2, forcing 3.h6 �c5 and drawing because the rook's pawn is the one that has gone ahead. If instead 2.�g3, then 2 ... 13fl !, and this time, when bringing his king up to the pawns, White doesn't have the possibility of that active manoeuvre which restricted the black king's mobility. (Check it for yourself!) In a struggle of rook against knight or bishop, the rook cannot usually prevail, and as a rule the game ends in a draw - although exceptions do occur, occasioned by the bad placing of the defending pieces. To defend with a knight, you should keep it next to the king or nearby, as in Position 4 1 1 . 41 1

Draw In this position, all attempts at winning are futile. For example: l.�a7 �h6 2.�h7 �g8! On the other hand 2 ... ltJg4?, separating the king and knight, would be a mistake - under such conditions, the exceptional cases are those where the defender saves himself Thus in the present case, White could win at once with 3.13h3!, after which Black loses his knight or is immediately mated: 3 ... ttJf2 4.�f3t; or 3 ...�g7 4.13g3; or 3 ...�e8 4.13h8#. In the next example, a rook defeats a bishop thanks to the presence of a pawn which White can sacrifice to put the enemy king in an extremely bad position. In practice this is the most important instance of the win with rook against bishop.

With the pawn on h5, theory considers the position to be drawn. Note that in the above variation 6 ... 'it>h8? (in place of 6 ...

Owing to the large number of checks (of which the most effective are those that come from behind and from close range) and also the many pins, it can be quite hard to advance the pawn as far as the seventh rank. But even with the pawn on the threshold of queening, major difficulties sometimes arise. Of course it all depends on the position. The following example reveals some characteristic features of this endgame. I.Y1Vf5!

White wins By occupying a square in the centre or close to it, the white queen deprives the black one of a range of checking possibilities. The threat now is 2.'it>g8, seeing that the answer 2 ...

2.Y1Vb1 t! c;t>c3 3.c;t>8s
The black queen can neither check on g1 nor set up a pin from a2. Such a quick loss is explained by the bad placing of Black's pieces as against the exceptionally strong placing ofWhite's.
288 The Soviet Chess Primer
In the diagram position the resources of the defence are noticeably increased if we merely reposition Black's king on a4, so that it won't get in the way of his own queen's manoeuvres; for example l .'Rf5 'Rb7, and possibilities for either checking or pinning along the diagonal are opened up for Black. Practice has shown that the win is achieved more easily with a centre pawn than with a bishop's pawn or (harder still) a knight's pawn. This can be explained by the fact that with the pawn shifted towards the flank, the king of the weaker side can find its most suitable square more easily; this square will be away from the manoeuvring paths of the queens (where the king's presence, in adverse circumstances, could even lead to an exchange). Let us turn to rook endings (by which rook and-pawn endings are understood). With no more than one rook on each side, a win is possible only as the rarest of exceptions - for example in positions on the edge of the board, of the following type:
[diagram]
White to move wins 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1
[diagram]
White to move wins In both cases, a dual attack involving a mate threat is decisive. In Position 4 1 6 White plays: I.S:g8 With the threat of E:h8#. In Position 417 he plays: l.�g6 Threatening E:f8#. After the black king moves, White wins the rook. If in Position 4 1 7 we transfer the white king to f6 and the black one to f8, the discovered check L'lt>g6t wins. Of course, notwithstanding these exceptions, anyone will call the endgame of rook versus rook hopelessly drawn. Even with rook and pawn against rook, there is usually no chance of winning if the king of the weaker side controls the pawn's promotion square or can hold up its advance by other means. Here again the win can be considered an exception, albeit not such a very rare one. To achieve it, the support of the stronger side's king is normally essential. And yet there are some known cases where the rook and pawn can do without that support. Chapter 8 - The Endgame 289

Black cannot reply by attacking the pawn (as he could if the king were on dB). After 2.c7, the pawn is not to be stopped from promoting. Although these two endings (4 1 8 and 4 1 9) are in the nature of exceptions, the ideas they contain are quite often met with in practice. Nonetheless, cases where the pawn cannot possibly do without the support of its king are of vastly more frequent occurrence.

Draw The knight's pawn proves nowhere near as dangerous as the bishop's pawn. u��g7t c;t>hs! A draw can be agreed. True, Black would lose after I ...<it>ffi?, but in a different way from before: 2.c;t>h7 l:!cl 3.l:!f7t c;t>es 4.<it>g7, and White wins by constructing a "bridge" as in the conclusion of Example 38 1 a on page 270 (see also Diagram 426). In Examples 420 and 42 1 White had an exceptionally favourable and active position (his rook was on the seventh rank, his pawn was shielding his king from checks along the sixth), while Black had an extremely passive one. And yet in order to win, it was essential to have the bishop's pawn (which in practice more rarely "survives" to the endgame stage). If in Diagram 420 we transfer the white rook to f7 (so that Black isn't threatened with mate) and the black one to an active post on c1 (so that it can give checks from behind), then White can no longer win (I .l:!g?t <it>f8!) . In the examples below, even two pawns are insufficient to win:

Draw Here Black is able to transfer his rook to a better position, namely the 6th rank. With the white king far away, this guarantees a draw. l.�fl White would gain nothing from 1 .E:a7t <i>g6. On l .<i>f3?, Black plays l ...E:fl t and 2 ... E:f6!. l ... :Sa5 With the idea of ... E:f5t and ... E:f6. Thanks to the check, the pawn is kept under constant "observation" from the black rook. This explains why l . ..E:a5 is simpler than the manoeuvre ... E:a1-d1 -d6. In such positions, generally speaking, if Black plays ... E:d 1 he has to reckon with the possible reply E:b8 followed by a regrouping of the white rook and pawn - which could be crucial, depending on the position of the kings. If White had played 1 . ci>g3, however, the correct reply would have been l ...E:fl ! 2.<i>g4 E:f6!, or 2.a7 E:a1 !.
294 The Soviet Chess Primer
It must be observed that this position is a critical one and that everything hangs by a single tempo. With the white king e2 (for instance), the whole system of defence no longer works. Let us see: 2.�d3 Ei:d5t 3.�c4 Ei:d6 4.�b5 White has defended his pawn and threatens Ei:c8, to shield himself from checks with decisive effect. Now 4 ... Ei:d5t fails to save Black, as 5.�c6 involves an attack on the black rook, giving White the time for Ei:c8 or Ei:b8. For the defence to be successful, the black rook needs to be further to the right - on the e-file if not the f-file - as we shall presently see.
2.<i>e3 E:e5t 3.'it>d4 E:e6!
The game will finish as a draw. For example:

[diagram]
Draw Here the black rook occupies an active position, keeping the white king off the 6th rank where it could create a threat of mate or of forcing the pawn forward. For a successful defence, the simplest plan is for Black's rook to stay on the 6th rank as long as White is manoeuvring with his rook or king, for example: l.E:b7 E:c6 However, once White pushes his pawn to e6, the rook must immediately prepare for checking and attacking the pawn from behind.
2.e6 E:cl
Black will easily hold the draw. If Black doesn't observe this rule, he can lose quickly. For example: l .Ei:c7 E:b6 2.Ei:a7 l:l:b5??
3.�f6, and if 3 ...
l:l:b6t then 4.e6 �d8 5.�f7, winning; or Bf3 ... l:l:b l , then 4.Ei:a8t �d7 5.e6t �d6 (otherwise 6.e7) 6.l:l:d8t �c7 7.e7, and again White wins. Of course, when defending, you don't always manage to take up such a favourable position with your rook as in Diagram 429, and the pawn often succeeds in reaching the sixth and sometimes the seventh rank. Is a successful defence then possible, even if the black king has been driven away from the pawn's promotion square? It turns out that it sometimes is possible. This brings us to a department of rook endgame theory that that is very important for practical play. Its detailed study is one of the most substantial achievements of a group of Soviet endgame theoreticians (most notably N. Grigoriev). Chapter 8 - The Endgame 295
[diagram]
Black to move - Draw The e-file, on which the pawn is located, divides the board into two unequal parts: on the right is the "short side" (three files), on the left is the "long side" (four files). If the black rook is on the long side and far enough away (with three files between the rook and the pawn), as in Diagram 430 - and if the white rook is ineffectively placed - then Black has a highly promising possibility for defending by means of checks from the side (along the rank). At the same time of course, Black's king has to be on the short side, so as not to get in the way of his own rook's checks.

From this we can see why the black rook is badly placed for defence if it is on the short side - in those circumstances the number of files between the rook and the pawn cannot be more than two. That, then, is the basic idea of the defence with checks from the side. Of course, much depends on the details of how the pieces are placed, making various exceptions possible. If, for example, Black's king in Position 430 is transferred to g8, he loses because the white king can reach the f6-square: 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 430b

The numerous exceptions - similar to those we have seen already, and explicable by this or that peculiarity of the piece configuration - mean that rook endings, so simple in appearance, are among the most difficult of endgame types. The handling of these positions can be made easier only by good knowledge of the theoretical cases. In particular, you need to acquire a thorough grasp of all the features of positions with the pawn on the seventh rank, Chapter 8 - The Endgame and then those with the pawn on the sixth - for it is to such positions that more complex ones gradually reduce. We will now look at some cases analogous to Diagram 430, only with the pawn not on a centre file but on the f-file - since this is more frequently seen in practice.
[diagram]
Black to move - White wins With an f-pawn, the "long side" becomes even longer (five files), and this facilitates Black's defence, since the b-file as well as the a-file becomes suitable for the rook. (With a g-pawn, the division between a short and a long side loses any meaning. Hence the endgame category under examination has only two sub classes - bishop's pawn and centre pawn.) In Position 43 1 , the lateral checks fail to save Black. No matter where the black rook is placed, White wins as long as his own rook is on the 8th rank (anywhere on the long side) or on any square of the d-, e- or f-files other than d6 (or of course d7). With the white rook on d6, Black draws in a manner familiar to us already from Position 430c: l ...l:!a8t 2.'il e7 �g7! Placed on the 8th rank or the f-file, the white rook lends extra strength to the pawn, while with his rook on the d- or e-file \\hire .:= shield himself from checks. Given the threat of�e8, the only defence that remains for Black in Position 43 1 is:
1. ..�g6 2J�d6t �h7
Now White has several winning moves (for example 3.�e8 or 3.l:!d1), but the all-purpose solution - seeing that it would also work with the rook on b6, c6 or e6 - is:
3JU6!
Observe that with the white rook on the e6- square, 3.�e8? leads to a draw on account of 3 ... l:!a8t 4.�e7 �g7!. In positions of this type, the placing of the black king is of no particular significance unless it enables Black to win the pawn or force a draw by some other special means, as in the following case. 431a

But now that we know the "winning zone" for the rook, we can play it to e4, d4 or c4 - only not to b4, for in that case White cannot shield himself from checks without losing the pawn.

Stalemate. With the pawn on the 6th rank, the drawing chances for the weaker side increase still further. But the play now becomes more complex: the web of variations and the quantity of exceptions multiply. Only players who have at their fingertips all the basic positions with the pawn on the sixth (with various configurations of the rooks and kings) can consider that they know these endings properly. Chapter 8 - The Endgame 299

4.f7 �a6t!, as in Position 432.
2 ...�a8 Any other move on the a-file is also playable, apart from 2 ...�a6?, which loses to 3.'it>f8t 'it>g6 4.f7 'it>f6 5.'it>g8!, since Black has no saving check on the g-file. 3J::!:e6 :Sb8 This is one of two drawing moves, along with 3 ...

From this line we can conclude that if Black had played 2 ...�al (for instance) instead of 2 ... :Sa8, then after 3.:Se6 the reply 3 .. .l:%a8! would have been obligatory. The following variation from Position 433 is also of interest: I..J�a7t 2.:Se7 :Sa8 3.:Se8 White also gains nothing by 3.'it>e6t 'it>g6

Black draws. How far the drawing chances are enhanced when the pawn is an f-pawn on the 6th rank can be seen from the fact that the draw is still attainable from Position 433 if we rearrange the rooks with the white one on d3 and the black one on c5 (separated from the pawn by just two files, not three!). 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 433a

Eih5 to follow. It would be over-hasty to conclude that positions like Diagram 438 are generally not won. A draw is the most likely outcome when the pawn on the edge of the board is in a forward position and the one nearer the centre is further back (g4, h5). If the pawns are placed the other way round (g5, h4) the king is sheltered from horiwntal checks and Black's resistance is hopeless. Among other things, this pawn configuration was also of vital importance in Position 410 on page 284 (Diagram 454 will be another case in point) . The study of theoretical endgames leads to the conclusion that with only one pawn left on the board together with some other pieces, the play tends to be quite difficult. It follows that exchanging pawns in the endgame is unfavourable to the stronger side. As a rule, an advantage is easier to exploit in positions where each side has several pawns. The play becomes much harder in endgames with no pawns at all. The struggle assumes a peculiar character of positional manoeuvring, the aim of which is the maximum constriction of the enemy pieces, particularly the king. A rook and minor piece cannot usually win against a rook, nor can a queen and minor piece against a queen. The strongest pairings, which do give certain winning chances in practice, are respectively rook plus bishop and queen plus knight. A queen can sometimes win against two minor pieces. It's interesting to note that a bishop and knight have the least power of resistance, whereas two bishops or two knights offer better drawing chances. In particular, two knights placed side by side can prevent the approach of the hostile king, providing the basis for a successful defence. Against a rook and pawn, a queen doesn't always win if the rook is stopping the enemy king from attacking the pawn. These endings are complicated, but ultimately the queen's winning chances must be rated quite highly. Two knights are sometimes capable of winning (giving mate) if the opponent possesses a pawn which is not very far advanced. On the analysis of these difficult endgames, much work was done by Alexey Troitsky (1 866- 1 942), the world-famous composer of studies. His analyses have been refined and supplemented by Vitaly Chekhover and Yuri Averbakh.
4. THE ENDGAME IN
PRACTICAL PLAY
Simple theoretical endings such as the ones examined in the foregoing section don't come about immediately with the transition from middlegame to endgame. There are usually a number of intermediate stages; as the quantity The Soviet Chess Primer of pieces gradually diminishes, different classes of endgame arise with various distributions of material. It sometimes happens that the material resources of the players are already severely depleted in the middlegame struggle, so that an exchanges of queens, or of some other pieces that were still sustaining the middlegame attack, is all it takes to bring about an ending of a relatively simple type. But then conversely, there are endings with several pieces (excluding queens) which reduce to simpler ones as the result of exchanging gradually. The prevalent type of complex ending is a position where each side has a rook (often both rooks) and some minor pieces. When exchanges are possible, we always have to weigh up which pieces we should leave on the board, which to be rid of, and which of the opponent's pieces we should be trying to destroy. Of course we would nearly always prefer to keep both bishops. If we do have to part with one of them, we need to have a good think about whether the light-squared or the dark-squared bishop will be more use to us. The decision usually rests on an assessment of the pawn weaknesses on either side, or of the dangers that some enemy piece may cause us. If the question is whether we want to be left with a bishop against a knight, or the other way round, we will basically be guided by the type of position - open or closed - in which we will have to continue; the additional presence of rooks, on the whole, does little to alter matters here. Bishops of opposite colours, with their drawing possibilities in the endgame (though by no means always in the middlegame!), are a special case. A book can give only the most general guidelines; a player has to take his own decision depending on the concrete circumstances. When the number of pieces left is very small, it is most important to assess the chances in a pure pawn endgame, so as to know in advance whether it pays us to go in for an exchange of the last remaining pieces. Endgame play is most often a matter of rook endings. That is understandable, seeing that the rooks usually enter the fight later than the other pieces (owing to the pawn obstacles in their way) and don't come into contact with each other as frequently as the minor pieces and queens. It is important therefore to gain wide experience of playing rook endgames in particular. It remains to recall that an active, aggressive deployment of our pieces, facing a passive and defensive position on the other side, is usually of crucial importance in chess. In quiet positions, the general method of play (as indicated before, in the section on "Realizing an Advantage") should consist of improving our piece formation gradually, in an endeavour to increase the advantage we already possess or to obtain a new one in another part of the board. We will clarify what has been said with some examples from practical games. 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 Smyslov - Euwe, Groningen 1 946

White to move As in Position 386 (see page 274), White has a tempo in hand (due to the placing of the black pawn on h6, not h7). He needs to bring about a situation on the queenside where this extra tempo will play a decisive role. A mistake would be 49.'�c3?, as after 49 ... �c5 Black closes the position by advancing his b-pawn. There is a more cunning way.

Black's defence is also difficult but not entirely hopeless after 23 ...�g7 24.l3xa7.

Black has been defending well, but here he commits the decisive error, allowing the white king to penetrate his position. The advance of the h-pawn will certainly have seemed dangerous to him, and he decides that the safest option is to defend by checking from the rear, especially in conjunction with one interesting manoeuvre that he has thought up. But his idea is brilliantly refuted by Chigorin. Black could have reached a draw by 34 ... 'it>g8

1. STRATEGIC IDEAS OF THE MIDDLEGAME
If even the endgame - the simplest part of a game of chess, as you might suppose - embraces such a wide variety of ideas and methods of combat, then you can easily imagine how much richer in content the middlegame can be, when the board is still full of pieces and there is wide scope for all manner of strategic designs and tactical strokes. The basic idea of endgames is to conduct to victory an advantage that you already possess. The main idea of the midlegame is to attain that advantage in the first place. Strictly speaking, the strategic ideas of the middlegame, especially its early stage, are already laid down in the opening. If you have managed to acquire an advantage out of the opening, you need to build on your success and increase that advantage. Utilizing the weaknesses that have appeared in your opponent's camp, and if possible creating new ones, you must try to obtain an attack and make your advantage decisive. If the opening has turned out badly, you need to defend, improve your position, and strive to obtain counterplay. In equal positions you should try to gain the initiative and then create some weaknesses in the enemy formation. Each phase of a chess game is characterized by its own specific difficulties. In the endgame, however, there are circumstances that often make our overall task and all kinds of calculations easier. There is the fact that the direction taken by the struggle is already determined; there is the paucity of material left on the board; and there is the fact that this material has to some extent been studied by theory. Likewise in the opening, standard systems for the initial development of the pieces have already been established and tested in practice, and in a measure they come to our aid. The middlegame is a different matter. Here, faced with an endless variety of complex positions, ideas and modes of combat, a player is left to his own devices to a much greater extent. He is compelled to rely almost entirely on his own powers - his understanding of the game and his skill. Nevertheless, theorists have studied many of the most typical features of the middlegame from the experience of countless games played by masters. Consequently even in this phase of the game, they can somewhat alleviate a player's task with advice on general principles, concerning the means of conducting the attack and defence and also of playing in equal positions. In the opening and endgame, the elements of chess "science" assert themselves very noticeably. It is characteristic of the middlegame that the elements of art predominate. Anyone can enrich
320 The Soviet Chess Primer
his own creative potential and widen its boundaries if he studies the best paradigms of master play conscientiously and in depth.
2. ATTACK AND THE METHODS
OF CONDUCTING IT
If with some move or other we place an enemy piece under fire, threatening to capture it, or if we take aim at an important square in order to occupy it, we are performing a simple act of aggression. If on the other hand, in persistent pursuit of our aim, we perform a logically connected series of such acts - even if they are interspersed with some preparatory ("quiet") moves or manoeuvres - then we are conducting an attack. An attack is generally understood as a series of moves linked by a common plan and aim, with the help of which a player endeavours to mate the enemy king or achieve a material or positional advantage, surmounting the obstacles encountered on the way. For an attack to be successful, two prerequisites are essential: (I) In the opponent's formation there must be some weaknesses, which will tell us where our attack should be directed; alternatively we must be confident that some weak points are bound to be formed in the process of the attack itself, or as a result of it. (2) We must possess superior forces in the sector where battle is going to be joined; or else we need to calculate in advance that we will gradually be able to concentrate more forces there than our opponent. It goes without saying that at the start of the attack our own position must be sound enough to avoid being overthrown or shattered by a strike from the other side (a counter-attack) . Our best guarantee, as we have seen from many previous examples, is a sturdy centre. Attacks can have the most varied aims, given the large quantity of different types of weakness. The greatest weakness in a position is the king. Consequently an attack will often be conducted against the castled position, or against the position of the uncastled king if for some reason castling has been held up. This is the most dangerous type of attack, seeing that it may be crowned by the king's demise (a "mating attack"). For the purpose of averting this, players will naturally take advance measures to make the position of their king sufficiently robust and safe. The attack then focuses on other objects, that is, other weaknesses - such as weak pawns and squares, files for an invasion with the major pieces, the seventh and eighth ranks, pieces that are badly placed, and so on. From the chapter on "Positional Play" we know that there are temporary weaknesses and lasting ones. This distinction determines the pace of our attack and the means of conducting it. Play against temporary weaknesses, which require swift exploitation, has to be as sharp and energetic as possible. Most often in these cases, the attack is "explosive", combinative. The same is true, as a rule, when the attacker has a significant preponderance of forces in the combat wne. On the other hand, lasting (permanent) weaknesses allow planned, systematic preparation of the attack, in other words a positional exploitation - which may also finally be crowned by a combinative stroke. It is essential in both cases to draw up a precise strategic plan for utilizing the weakness, and the tactical execution of this plan must be well thought out. It must never be forgotten that a tactical error is often fraught with dire consequences; in a trice it is liable not only to destroy the fruits of all your previous work but also to bring about defeat. With a series of examples we will clarify what has been said. At the same time we shall Chapter 9 - The Middlegame 321 be throwing light on many other features that characterize the different types of attack and the methods of conducting them. Spielmann - Chigorin, Nuremberg 1 906 a f g h White to move White has chosen a passive system of development that presents Black with no difficulties.

Steinitz - Bardeleben, Hastings 1 895 White to move The initiative here evidently belongs to White. Black is two tempos behind in development: he has not castled (as White has), and it is White to move in this position. The c- and e-files are open for the white rooks. White's position in the centre is preferable - he is the only one with a pawn there. True, the pawn on d4 is isolated, and whether this pawn is strong or weak is not yet fully clear. How is White to make use of his advantage? It is obvious, at any rate, that this advantage is only temporary and that White must operate with exceptionally powerful threats. One moment's delay, and Black will castle - after which the situation of the d4-pawn will become critical. With the help of a typical device - a frontal pin on a piece - White stops his opponent from castling.

The "automatic" occupation of an open file is sometimes quite a good move, but here it is definitely not in keeping with the sharpness of the position. A stronger continuation was indicated by P.

He should first have completed his intended plan of defence by playing 1 6. ..�f7, with ... ttJd5 and ...c6 to follow. In so doing, there was no need at Chapter 9 - The Middlegame 323 all to be afraid of the sacrifice 17.�xe7t �xe7 1 8.Eixe7t �xe7 1 9.Eixc7t, in view of 1 9. ..�d6! 20.Eixb7 Elac8, and then 2 1 ...Eic7, after which White could scarcely save himself from loss. After the move in the game, White's 1 6.Eiacl justifies itself completely, and from here on he conducts the attack impeccably.

Another typical ploy: a pawn sacrifice to clear the d4-square for the knight (and open the c-file at the same time). Incidentally, this example already brings home to us how an isolated pawn on d4 can be either weak or strong according to circumstances. It is strong when securing outposts for pieces in the centre, or when it can advance like a "battering ram" (usually exchanging itself to create a breakthrough or to open lines) . The pawn is weak when its position is passive, that is, when totally blockaded and with no outposts to be secured.

How difficult it was to calculate may be gauged from the fact that numerous annotators, even to this day, have been coming forward with various supplementary analyses which have gradually, more and more comprehensively, revealed the scope of Chigorin's profound vision. Diagram 458 is of further interest as an example of a case where the attacking problem can also be solved by a positional approach, depending on the player's inclinations and style. Lasker, for instance, suggested the following positional method of attacking from here: 1 9.a5 .La5 20J!xb7 Wfd8 2 l .Wfa4, and now 2 1 ...h6 22.tDxf5 tDxf5 23.Wfxc6 Wfc8

Usually, therefore, you are only advised to go ahead with the assault if your opponent has no possibility of exploiting this weakness by some dangerous counter-stroke, particularly in the centre. In the example we just examined, the centre was fairly tightly closed and under White's control, which is why Black proved so helpless in face of the attack. But then it is also true that he was defending too passively. Instead of the fruitless attempts to "flee" with his king, he should have initiated counter-pressure against the centre as soon as possible with ... E:c8, ... c6 and so forth, however slim a chance it might have been. In addition, considering that the king's shelter of pawns was inevitably going to be breached, he should have tried organizing a defence of the king with his major pieces on the seventh rank and his bishops on d8 and e8. A pawn storm may also be carried out if a thorough and precise assessment of the position has convinced you that you will reach your goal before your opponent's counter manoeuvres in the centre can take effect. Here is an example: Chigorin - Schiffers, St Petersburg (14) 1 897

Black resigned. 1-0 Mutual pawn storms, when the players have castled on opposite wings, are a special case. Here, a pawn offensive with the aim of opening lines does not entail a weakening of your own king's position, so the question of a sufficiently stable centre is of much less importance. The crucial question is whose pawns will come into contact with the enemy and start opening lines sooner, thus helping to create dangerous threats. The first player to be forced to go over to defence will end up in the worse position. Therefore before starting the assault (and even before castling on the opposite wing to his opponent), a player will usually take pains to weigh up the mutual attacking chances, to count how many pawn moves each side will need and to assess the kind of threats that will result from breaking through. It normally takes 4-6 moves for two pawns to get through; you have to work out what your opponent will manage to do in that time. Sometimes in order to secure the better chances for himself, a player will slightly delay castling and try to make at least one of his aggressive pawn moves in advance. Chigorin - Pillsbury, St Petersburg 1 895/6 White to move An advance of the g- and h-pawns to g5 and h5, in conjunction with the exchange of dark squared bishops, appears tempting to White, as it ensures the opening of files for his rooks and the demolition of his opponent's kingside. But castling long is not without its dangers: Black has already made one of his own pawn storming moves ( ...b5), and the advance of his a-pawn will guarantee the opening of a file for his rook. Nonetheless Chigorin decides that the move ttJ b 1 will give him a sufficient defence in the short term, and that he will have time to implement his plan.

Black resigned. 1-0 Mutual pawn storms on opposite flanks quite often arise even when the players have castled on the same side. Suppose both opponents have castled short and White has started a pawn storm against the enemy king's position, after first taking care to close the centre firmly as a safety measure. Then Black will often be left with no other option than to begin an impetuous pawn offensive of his own on the queenside. Here again, the decisive question is which player will first be compelled to go over to long-term defence. In general, practice has shown that the attack against the king is more dangerous, as it is linked to mating threats. The following example is characteristic. 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 Pillsbury - Tarrasch, Hastings 1 895

Black went on to win, thanks to the pawn weaknesses that have appeared in his opponent's camp . ...0-1 Up to now we have been looking at examples of the attack against a castled position on the kingside. In principle, attacking a king that has castled long entails nothing new. To succeed in either case, the attack requires the opening of lines, a concentration of forces, and weaknesses in the enemy position. We can only note that defending a castled position on the queenside tends to be slightly more difficult, mainly owing to the weakness of the pawn on a2 (a7), which often necessitates an extra king move to b1 (b8). Hence when the players castle on opposite wings, the king position on the queenside will be slightly the more vulnerable when the opponent attempts to open lines. Here are three examples of attacks against castled positions on the queenside with different types of weakness: 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 Pillsbury - Chigorin, London 1 899

Yet even what looks like an absolutely safe king position, sufficiently defended by numerous pieces, can be demolished with catastrophic speed as the result of a combination that subtly takes account of various kinds of concealed weakness. With the first blow that shatters the seeming equilibrium of forces and the outward calm, these weaknesses come to light. Botvinnik - Vidmar, Nottingham 1 936

There is nothing, you might suppose, to indicate that the tension has reached its culminating point and that a mighty combinative blow is just about to be struck. Yet this is what nonetheless occurred. For a full understanding of the grounds of White's deep combination, observe the masked "X-ray'' action of his pieces: the queen hitting the rook on c8, the bishop hitting the points f7 and g8, and the rook on f5 hitting the points d5 and f7.

Black chose the correct plan of attack, and it developed with astonishing ease. 0-1 Our concluding example (see Diagram 489) illustrates that dangerous weapon, a "theoretical novelty''. Although introduced in the opening, such a novelty is bound to place a specific imprint on the middlegame phase, and will indeed often bring about a quick transition from opening to middlegame. Position 492 (Capablanca - Marshall), which we examine later, is also characteristic of this. We are not speaking of any new and profound strategic constructs, but of cases where you try to catch your opponent in a variation you have prepared in advance, containing some tactical idea which has not been employed in practice previously and is usually sharp - thus setting him the difficult problem of finding a satisfactory rejoinder at the board, with limited thinking time. As a rule, this kind of ploy is double-edged: sometimes it brings success, sometimes it meets with a determined refutation. It all depends on how solid the positional basis for the novelty is, and how thoroughly it has been prepared. In home analysis it can be hard to find the objectively best moves for both sides; The Soviet Chess Primer hence the novelty undergoes genuine testing only in a tournament - with its "baptism of fire". In the example given below, as we shall see from the notes, the idea of the attack was sound but the variations were inadequately worked out. A. Rabinovich - Alekhine, Moscow 1 9 1 7 This game is little-known. It was played at the Moscow Chess Club on 2 1 February 1 9 17. Alekhine published the annotations in March of the same year.

A large specialized book could be written on this topic alone, and it would still not exhaust it. In any event the examples show that the ability to attack is a great and complex art. There are, of course, situations where the opponent's camp contains certain typical kinds of weakness and the attack "plays itself", so to speak (essentially it proceeds by analogy with countless games played earlier). But leaving aside such attacks that follow well-worn patterns, a player needs delicate understanding of the position and great inventiveness to conceive the plan for an attack and then prepare and execute it. We shall go into this in more detail in the section on "Equal Positions".
3. DEFENCE AND COUNTER-ATTACK
For the side that lags in development and is under attack, the guiding strategic idea is to parry the enemy's threats - to defend - and to try to equalize the game after catching up in development, proceeding afterwards (should it prove possible) to a counter-attack. When some weakness in our position has given our opponent the chance for aggression, the task of the defence is to increase the obstacles in the attacker's path in any way possible, and to set up new ones if we can. In the process we must of course try to rid ourselves of our existing weakness in one way or another (for instance by advancing a backward pawn, exchanging an isolated one, and so on). Many chessplayers find defending easier than attacking. The defender doesn't have to think up an aggressive plan and exert himself to find all sorts of ways of reinforcing the attack; he doesn't have to worry about sustaining its pace and its unabating tension. He is not running the risk that the attack may fail, in which case the weaknesses in the aggressor's own position, incurred in the process of the attack, can easily make themselves felt. Others players conversely feel that defence is more difficult, because when defending you have to be on full alert for a long stretch of time, ready to repel any threat or series of threats that your opponent manages to devise - and with an imprecise defence you can quickly lose. It's hard to decide which opinion carries more weight. It would be most correct of all to say that attack and defence in equal measure demand significant effort and skill. Great masters have always been capable both of attacking well and of defending well. But at all events there is no doubt that games are not, as a rule, won by defence alone. Of course, the defensive method that you select depends on the character of the attack in each case, but basically a distinction is drawn between two kinds of defence: passive and active. Passive defence is adopted out of necessity in cases where our opponent's attack is especially sharp and dangerous (such as when he is playing for mate). Here every move has to further the aim of bolstering our position against his immediate or presently impending threats; or else it must seek exchanges to weaken the pressure of the hostile pieces. If we succeed in beating back the onslaught, and our opponent then has to spend some moves on bringing up his reserves and on all kinds of preparatory manoeuvres, we must at once go over to active defence. With a certain choice of moves at our disposal, we will prepare only the essential defences against threats that are imminent; we will use the rest of the time for gradually strengthening our position in a way that will permit us to deliver a counter stroke in some important sector of the board, to reduce the pace of the enemy attack still further and perhaps even repulse it completely. The Soviet Chess Primer The time that the opponent loses by retreating we must utilize for preparing or launching a counter-attack. The ultimate aim of active defence should consist of just this - counter attack - or at least in endeavouring to wrest the initiative from our opponent. Of course, if the opponent has launched an attack that is premature or has little foundation generally, then the defence proves much easier and the counter-attack is achieved more quickly. A basic principle of the defence is never to do voluntarily what our opponent wants to force us to do. No concession and no weakening, until compelled by force of circumstances! The more effort it takes our opponent to achieve his end, the more time we will have at our disposal for repelling the attack. We will now elucidate these methods and principles of defence in concrete terms. Chigorin - Schiffers, St Petersburg 1 897

With the white knight on f5, this move would have been unplayable. True, Black is still winning the exchange, but in return White obtains a strong passed pawn and also the square e4 for his minor pieces. What happens here is something we can frequently observe: with the win of material, the attack seems to reach its climax and then immediately abates. If White's defence, so far, has been necessarily passive, Chigorin now switches to defending actively.

Chapter 9 - The Middlegame 349 With every move, White improves his formation (by deploying all his pieces in strong aggressive positions); he puts a final stop to all his opponent's attempts at reviving the attack, and eventually obtains a powerful counter attack of his own. Black's defence, conversely, will remain extremely passive for the rest of the game. Rather than make fruitless attempts to attack on the kingside, he needed to devise some plan for active defence, for instance by preparing a counter-sacrifice of the exchange on d5.

Chigorin's masterly play calls for admiration. Perhaps the greatest of chess skills, in both defence and attack, is the ability to achieve major results with a minimum of forces. After White's 36th move we could see that Chigorin would only need his bishop on e4 and his pawn on f3 to paralyse the activity of black's three major pieces and g-pawn, and to secure his own kingside permanently. With 37.a5 White has paralysed two black pawns with one of his own, cramped his opponent and acquired the square b6 for an invasion with his rook. 37• • . �d6 38.�g2 :B:f6 39.c3! dxc3 40.�xc3 :B:c7 41.�d2 h6 42.:B:b6 �f8 43.�b2! �e7

fu the result of aWhite to move badly played opening, White has landed in a grave situation in view of the pin against his knight on d4. There is nothing for it but to defend patiently, creating all possible obstacles for his opponent and setting him new and difficult tasks with each move. l l.a3 Black is now faced with the need to set about calculating a large number of variations. White will answer 1 l .. . .Bc5 with 1 2.b4. Will a knight or bishop sacrifice on b4 give Black anything? Black must have come to the conclusion that with defensive moves such as 'IMfcl and 1"la4 available to White, neither of the sacrifices on b4 would serve his purpose. (Check this for yourself]) Perhaps Black should meet 1 2.b4 with 1 2. .. .Bxd4.

A triumph of active defence! 1-0 In this last example, the play was based on the theme of mutual pins against knights. In the middlegame in general, pins have a major role to play. Let us look into them a little more closely. This will involve examining the most typical case of a pin.
[diagram]
The knight on f3 is pinned. To a certain extent the queen too is tied down, for if it moves away Black will capture on £3, and White's pawn position (after g2xf3) will be disrupted and weakened. When a pin arises you have to try to free yourself from it, or your opponent may gradually build up an attack based on the pin moti£ Prevention of the pin by h2-h3, as we already know, gives the enemy's attack a target and is sometimes dangerous. There are a number of basic methods of freeing yourself. You can play Ae2, after which there is no longer any pin at all. If the bishop on g4 is undefended, the tactic demonstrated in Position 497 is sometimes possible: I.tlxd4, and if l ...exd4 then 2.Bxg4, or if I ...Bxe2 then 2.ltlxe2, winning a pawn in either case. (This ingenious leap with the knight is useful to remember; we saw it employed in Position 49 1 , among other places.) Another possibility to free yourself (in Position 496) is the following. First bring out the bishop from cl to e3, f4 or g5; then play ltlbd2 and c2-c3, and afterwards (say) �c2 or �b3. This completes the freeing manoeuvre the defence of the knight on f3 has been taken over by the one on d2. One other freeing plan that may be applied is �el , ltlbd2, ltlfl , ltlg3 and then h2-h3. After this, Black can only withdraw his bishop along the h3-c8 diagonal or else make an exchange on f3 that favours White. The presence of an additional piece on the kingside (the knight on g3) makes the move h2-h3 less dangerous. Chapter 9 - The Middlegame 355 497 498 There might seem to be a simpler way to free yourself - by playing h2-h3, ... .Bg4-h5 and g2-g4. But your own pawn position is greatly weakened by this all too straightforward method of driving the bishop away. The bishop withdraws from h5 to g6, and then the g4-pawn is subjected to an attack by ...h5. This move is especially unpleasant if Black has not yet castled, so that the file is opened for his rook (see Diagram 498). Driving the bishop back with the pawns like this is sometimes justified if you can create an attack on the same wing, concentrating your pieces there. l.e4 e5 2.<�Jf3 tlJc6 3 . .Bc4 .Bc5 4.O-O t2Jf6 5.d3 d6 6 . .Bg5? 8 7 6 5 4 3

Eihl#. Instances of an inopportune pin are only exceptions, however. In most cases a pin hampers the opponent and is extremely useful to the attacker, as we have seen from many examples. As soon as a pin arises, therefore, the defender has to think about the best means of freeing himself from it. Removing a pin without impairing his own pawn formation is just one event that may be part of a defender's struggle. Practice recognizes a good many other equally typical actions that have local importance, such as the methods of fighting for possession of an open line, or reconquering a file from the opponent, or guarding the invasion squares in a file, and so on. It pays to give close attention to all these devices when playing through master games, seeing that acquaintance with these games serves to improve your technique and raise the overall class of your play. An important defensive measure is to make use of the special possibilities that sometimes result from going into an endgame; this means exploiting the particular features of the material that remains after exchanges (for example, bishops of opposite colours). We spoke of this before, in the section on "Realizing an Advantage", and some further advice will be given at the end of this chapter. In elucidating the methods and resources of defence, we have so far been speaking only of defence in the direct sense of the word; defence in this sense meant opposing force against force, in other words relying on the power of one move to counter another, while only rarely making use of the peculiarities of the material (opposite bishops and the like). And yet other defensive methods also exist. The first of these amounts to an attempt, so to speak, to bypass the problem, to oppose force with guile, with a trap. The second method endeavours to remove the problem itself, that is, to eliminate the very need for defence; it relies on preventing the attack by anticipating it with so-called "prophylactic" moves. Here is an example of a trap that Chigorin once fell for: 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 Chigorin - Schlechter, Ostend 1 905
[diagram]
Black to move Chapter 9 - The Middlegame 357 The simplest way for White to win would be through an exchange of queens. This is what Black relies on, to bait a trap in his hopeless position: l.. .'�c7t This looks like an obvious mistake, as White can interpose his queen (with check!) to bring the exchange about. There followed:

Sometimes, moves that set traps are harmful to the player's own position. Here, where Black has nothing to lose, the trap is entirely aVp2-pVro2 priate. The same psychological motif had more severe consequences in the following position. 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1

However, as Black attempts to do so, the trap snaps shut: l. ..Y!Yg5t 2.tllg4t!! bxg4 3J�hl t The black queen is lost. Traps, especially such refined ones as those we have just shown, are seen comparatively rarely in practice, however. They can be evaded with very attentive play, if you persist in trying to figure out why your opponent has made such-and-such a move that looks bad for him, and don't jump to the conclusion that he has simply made a mistake. Preventive (prophylactic) moves are of much greater importance. Their idea is to thwart the opponent's aggressive intentions well in advance. 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 Black.burne - Nimzowitsch St Petersburg 1 9 14
[diagram]
Black to move If Black plays • • J�e8 here, this move can have only one point: Black is trying to oppose the advance d3-d4. His opponent will be forced to think hard about whether to play that way, given that after ... exd4 the e-file will be opened The Soviet Chess Primer up for the black rook - which will start to exert pressure (albeit masked at first) against the pawn on e4 and the queen on the same file. Black's ... E:e8 is a typical "prophylactic move" . Active opposition to the opponent's plans may be expressed not only in individual moves, as in the above example, but in a whole series of them, a complete defensive system. To illustrate this, let us consider the openings known as gambits. In these openings, one player (generally White) sacrifices a pawn in the interests of fast development for his pieces. In the old days the other player would take the gambit pawn and then strive to hold on to it with all his might, presenting his opponent with an advantage in development and allowing him to work up a formidable attack. Present day masters, on the other hand, attempt to nip the opponent's aggressive intentions in the bud; they do take the gambit pawn but are more concerned about developing their pieces, and will give the pawn back willingly once the opponent has expended some effort (to the detriment of his development) to recover it. Take the opening known as the Evans Gambit: l.e4 e5 2."!l�6 �c6 3 . .i.c4 .i.c5 4.b4 This is what a "gambit" amounts to - a pawn sacrifice. 4 ... hb4 5.c3 .i.a5 6.d4 So far everything has gone smoothly - White has set up a strong pawn centre. In the old days Black used to continue with 6 . ..exd4, and after 7.O-O he faced a difficult choice: whether to play 7 ...dxc3, winning a second pawn but allowing White a considerable lead in development, or to make some developing move without allowing White to obtain an "ideal" pawn centre with 8.cxd4. In either case Black had no easy task ahead of him. Contemporary masters don't play 6 ...exd4, but a more modest continuation: 6 ...d6! This restricts Black to the gain of one pawn only, but at the same time fortifies the centre. After this White's attacking chances are immediately reduced, since he can no longer hamper Black's development by advancing his centre pawns. White begins to worry about regaining his sacrificed pawn, as otherwise his opponent will eventually be left with the advantage.
7.dxe5 dxe5 s.YMxdSt �xdS 9.c!the5
Black can now obtain a comfortable game by playing: 9 ... i.e6 This whole vanatton was first employed by Lasker, and White has come away empty handed. He wanted to attack, but now he has to play a most prosaic ending, in which his position is actually worse in view of the weakness of his queenside pawns. Thus his aggressive designs already come to grief in the first few moves. The above examples have shown us prophylactic moves in use. It must be said that in practice such moves are employed very widely. We may definitely say that there exists a third wholly distinct type of defence (apart from active and passive), which we would call "preventive", prophylactic defence. In essence, preventive defence is applied right from the start of the game, when, with the aid of swift and centralized development of the pieces, we strive not only to create a basis for future active operations but also to forestall any possible aggressive designs on our opponent's part. Preventive defence takes sober account of all the opponent's possibilities; it ascertains the direction or directions in Chapter 9 - The Middlegame 359 which he may try to act; it tries to anticipate his possible attacking plans, and prepares the defences in advance (his attack will come up against well-placed defensive pieces). Thus the idea of preventive defence simply consists of not permitting any attack from our opponent's side - in making it impossible from the very outset. But then how are we to conduct the game, how do we work up an attack and try to win, when both players concern themselves with preventive measures and set up sturdy defensive positions with no evident weaknesses? This will be the subject of the next section.
4. EQUAL POSITIONS
Free and harmonious development of the pieces on both sides; each player caring about a sturdy centre and about not permitting weaknesses (at least not obvious ones) in his own formation; and each of the opposing sides attending to "preventive defence" in the way we mentioned - all this, as a rule, leads to so-called "equal positions", or more precisely, positions with a relative equilibrium of forces. Genuinely equal positions - equal through and through - only tend to arise later on, after simplifying exchanges. If at that stage there are no attacking possibilities left that might promise even the smallest success, and if the pawns facing each other in equal numbers on the wings are arranged in such a way that no means of creating a passed pawn can be discerned - then of course it makes no sense to play on, and a draw should simply be agreed. The positions that call for our attention, however, are not these hopelessly drawn ones, but those where the possibilities of gradually obtaining an attack are not yet exhausted, where the equilibrium of forces is a relative matter and can still be disturbed as a result of some kind of manoeuvres by one of the players. These positions are of special practical interest because they are the very ones in which the fight usually has to be conducted after good opening play by both sides. The struggle in such balanced positions presents no small problems, given that there are no obvious weaknesses, and that if any slight weaknesses do exist, they are well defended; thus the overall configuration of the pieces fails to indicate any clear lines along which a future attack could gradually be developed. It follows that the formulation of a game plan is our principal difficulty. In some positions of comparative equilibrium, it is possible to probe some unobtrusive weaknesses - you might say microscopic ones - in the opponent's formation, and gradually magnify them by a process of delicate manoeuvring. In such cases we will be aiming to improve our own position steadily, step by step, through increasing the sphere of action of each piece. Any hasty undertaking in a balanced position is dangerous because when we divert pieces to that end, we may be causing some squares in other sectors of the board to be weakened - and our opponent may make use of this. It can be taken as characteristic of many balanced positions (even as a special kind of law) that to obtain an advantage in one place you have to grant concessions of some sort in another. Weighing the advantages against the concessions requires both wide experience and great perspicacity. To start an attack under such conditions, we need an acute assessment of the level of risk as well as the expected gains. We need a well developed feeling of measure for determining the strength and speed of the attack, which must not entail sacrificing the stability of our centre or of our position as a whole.

Black to play Both sides are fully developed. White has played the opening rather passively. His pieces are not subjecting the enemy formation to that pressure which should, and could, have been achieved by the player with the right of the first move. For this reason, the decision Black takes - to try to seize the initiative immediately - would seem perfectly well-founded. But where and how is he to strike his blow? Many chessplayers would not even give this a thought. They would "automatically" make a move that is good on general principles but bad in the current situation, namely 1 5. .. E!:ac8, on the grounds that they were "finishing off their development". Why is this move bad? Not of course because of 1 6. .Bxa7? ( ...b6!), but because of 1 6.b3, when difficulties arise for Black. (Where is his bishop to go, and how does he prevent White from moving his knight and then playing c2-c4 with a clear positional plus?) Subtly weighing up the situation, Botvinnik makes use of the position of his rook opposite the enemy queen.

[diagram]
White to move Following 14 ...b5 (played to prevent c2-c4), the square c5 is felt as a certain weakness in Black's position, even though at present his minor pieces are guarding it. Should White play 1 5.j,xd6, Black would not of course answer with 1 5. .. '1Mfxd6? but with 1 5. ..cxd6!, making c5 inaccessible to the white pieces. White cannot, then, utilize the weakness of c5 at the moment. Turning to the position of Black's e- and f-pawns, we can easily recognize that if either of them moves, weaknesses will be formed in the black camp - on e5 after .. .f5, or on f5 after ...e5; but if they stay where they are, the pawns will safely cover White's invasion squares. Thus although Black's position appears rather cramped, it is nonetheless solid enough. White's position, on the other hand, has no weaknesses. It is much freer than that of his opponent. The initiative unquestionably belongs to White. But what can he undertake here? It is interesting and instructive to follow the overall plan that Botvinnik selects, and also the manoeuvres of his pieces that he carries out with a view to that plan's accomplishment.

White to move Black's pieces might seem well developed. A certain defect of his position, perhaps, can only be discerned in the placing of his knight on b6, which is somewhat out of the action. If this piece can be transferred to the kingside, the position promises to level out before long. The "pride" of White's formation is his strong pawn phalanx on c4 and d4, depriving the black pieces of important central squares.

12.5
After this the pawn on e4 becomes backward and weak, and the e5-square is turned into a strongpoint for Black. In compensation for this weakening, however, White has obtained a number of assets. The mobility of the knight on e7 and the bishop on c8 is restricted; the f4-square has been cleared for the bishop on c l ; and the f5-pawn presses against Black's weak point e6. A characteristic example of gaining certain advantages in return for some concessions! 12• • • b6 Black has decided at once to open fire against the e4-pawn from all his batteries.

It is quite easy to see that situations of this kind are the very ones where a player's highest skill is displayed. No matter what level of qualification the player may have attained, there will still be wide scope for further improvement here, by means of deep analysis and study of exemplary tournament games.
5. TRANSITION TO THE ENDGAME
A player who gains a positional advantage in the middlegame will of course try to increase it and launch an attack on the basis of it, targeting the king or other objectives to deliver mate or win material. If however the attack runs up against difficulties, or if the advantage (particularly a material one) is of a type that can be more easily converted into a win in the endgame, then it makes sense to set about simplifying the position. So after a successful attack, you may want to go into an endgame to exploit the advantage you have acquired; but also after an attack that has not completely worked, you may look to the endgame to make good what you failed to achieve in the middlegame, or to deny your opponent the chance to start a counter-attack. But then again, when defending, you often attempt to reach an endgame so as to reduce or repel the attack - and also sometimes to obtain a counter-attack - as a result of the exchange of pieces. Position 494 on page 352 (Kotov - Sokolsky) provides a good example of transition from an unfavourable middlegame to a pleasant ending, in which White, though the exchange down, has a counter-offensive. Position 493 (Romanovsky- Botvinnik), where Black went into the ending while repulsing his opponent's attack, is also characteristic. The transition to an endgame is a crucial turning point in a game of chess, demanding thorough attention to a number of factors. The most important of these have already been mentioned in the "Endgames" chapter. However, the variety of special points here is so great that there would be no use in any kind of general advice on how and in what circumstances to go into an endgame. The concrete peculiarities of the position must be the decisive arguments in each case. There is just one typical scenario that is worth dwelling on; it involves players who are Chapter 9 - The Middlegame 365 not very experienced. You can often observe that after winning material (a pawn, say, or perhaps the exchange), their fighting energy is virtually extinguished. A player who has just been playing with imagination and boldness supposes that his aim is achieved, and in fear of forfeiting his "gains" he suddenly becomes all too cautious and irresolute. He sees exchanges as the sole aim and rationale of the subsequent play - even when they are antipositional, involving losses of tempo and so forth. Such a primitive approach to the matter of going into an endgame is of course profoundly mistaken. Achieving an advantage is not enough - you still have to convert it into a win. As the result of timid and feeble manoeuvres by the lucky possessor of an extra pawn, his opponent acquires a number of positional assets, which in the end may enable him to regain the material; or even if this fails, the advantage will still have been made more difficult to exploit. It must never be forgotten that having the attack is an advantage, and no small one either. A serious attack is testimony to a major positional achievement. After winning material, you must continue the attack just as imaginatively as before; or if it is exhausted, try to achieve an active piece formation once again. In renewing the attack (or perhaps merely organizing active pressure on your opponent's position), your aim need not be the further gain of material. If the advantage you have is sufficient, you have no reason to increase it. But with your opponent under pressure, it is much easier to force him into an endgame at the right moment, under conditions that favour yourself. We now give some examples of purposeful transition to an endgame: Bronstein - Mak.ogonov, Moscow 1 944
[diagram]
White to move White's attack has reached a dead end - it is hard to strengthen it. Black's chances in the coming struggle can perhaps even be rated as somewhat superior, considering the strong position of his rook on a7 on the open file, and the weakness of White's pawn on c3. White therefore takes the sensible decision to go into an ending, and achieves this with the help of a combination calculated a long way ahead.

32.ga6t
Black resigned. 1-0 In the "Endgames" chapter we examined the characteristic defensive resources based on the fact that with certain distributions of pieces in the endgame, some types of material advantage are insufficient to win. Such for example are the cases with just one minor piece left, or two knights with no pawns; or again the numerous positions in rook endgames where one extra pawn doesn't guarantee victory and sometimes even two pawns are no help. Positions ofthis kind are sometimes the refuge that the weaker side is seeking when going into an endgame. A particularly typical case is where the defender tries to reach an ending with opposite bishops, of which the drawing tendency is well known. It should however be observed that the presence of opposite bishops in an ending gives no complete guarantee that the game will end in a draw. Chapter 9 - The Middlegame 367 The following instructive endgame may serve as an example: Reti - Romanovsky, Moscow 1 925

1. THE MODERN OPENING AND HOW IT IS PLAYED IN PRACTICE
The most intensively studied branch of chess theory is probably that of the openings. The game's researchers have given it more attention than anything else, and the reason for this is not hard to understand. Every chessplayer, after all, is concerned to deploy his pieces in the best possible manner at the start of the game. He looks for formations that will ensure his king's safety and enable him to mount strikes against his opponent's position. But what is the nature of these formations? Among the great diversity of opening moves, you can easily land in a muddle if you don't have a clear notion of the basics of opening strategy. In the earlier chapters of this book we have already spoken of the dangers lying in wait for a player at the start of the game if he neglects the basic principles of normal opening development. Correctly conducting the opening of a game is no simple task. The theory of the openings didn't take shape all at once. Many years passed before those key ideas which ought to guide a player in the opening were precisely formulated. The accumulation of material for opening theory began from the end of the fifteenth century. At first, investigators merely sought and discovered various continuations which they would improve and systematize. But this was not enough. Generalizations, appropriate laws, were needed to offer guidance in the labyrinth of variations. Such generalizations emerged for the first time in the eighteenth century, and in our own day they have been converted into an orderly system of opening knowledge. The principles of opening strategy that characterize all opening systems were discussed before, in Chapter 7. It would be a mistake to suppose, for instance, that such principles as the efficient and speedy development of the pieces, control of the centre, and so forth, are purely for the guidance of beginners. Promoted and borne out in the tournament practice of many years, these principles direct the conduct of the opening even in master chess. However, besides the requirement to observe general principles, every opening presents its own particular, specific tasks, determined by the formation of pieces that characterizes it. We can of course only speak of these tasks when examining each opening separately. Understanding an opening is the first and most important step towards learning to play it correctly. Anyone who understands the opening he is playing will hardly ever give his opponent opportunities to make serious gains at the beginning of the game. The Soviet Chess Primer As an example, let us look at the following game played in the Sicilian Defence. Borbely - Kovacs, Oradea 1 948 l.e4 c5 2.<�)£3 d6 3.d4 cxd4 4.�xd4 llJc6
5.i.b5 i.d7 6.i.xc6 bxc6 7.llJc3 llJf6 8.i.g5
Just what went on in this little game? Let us attempt a critical examination of the way the events unfolded. White's 4th move was a deviation from the generally accepted continuation 4.llJxd4. According to everything we have already said about the foundations of opening strategy, this move cannot be all that dangerous to Black. The white queen has undoubtedly come into play too early. Black's decision to take on c6 with the pawn (6 ... bxc6) appears questionable. Black is behind in the development of his kingside pieces, and from this viewpoint it would be more useful to take on c6 with the bishop. Then a subsequent ... llJf6 would set up an attack on the e4-pawn, and an advance with e4-e5 could be met by ...�xf3. Nonetheless 6 ... bxc6 does have its positive points. The position after 8.�g5 deserves a diagram. The fact that Black has not understood the character of the struggle in this opening is confirmed by the move 8 .. J::!: b8. With his backward development he shouldn't be allowing an opening of lines that can benefit only White. Black should have played 8 ...e5, reinforcing his position in the centre; he would then have had a game rich in possibilities. In the position after 1 O.lt:lxe5 it is already obvious that Black has played the opening badly, and his position is very difficult. The most tenacious way to defend would have been 10 ... E!:b7, and if 1 1 .O-O-O then 1 1 ..JWb6. After 10 ... E!:xb2?! White can simply play 1 l .Ei:d1 E!:b7 12.O-O, and Black could hardly expect to survive the pressure along the centre files. On 1 1 .�xf6, Black should have tried 1 1 ...exf6, and after 1 2.lt:lxd7 he could have confused the issue with 1 2. . JWe7t; for example, 1 3.<;:t>fl '1Wxd7 or 1 3.lt:le4 E!:b4. One other comment - about 1 2.lt:lxd7. Why didn't White take on d7 with his queen? Wouldn't this have been more forcing? Here we can once again see how careful and attentive you need to be, even in a winning position: after 1 2.'\Wxd?t '1Wxd7 13.lt:lxd7 Black would reply 1 3. .. E!:xc2, and the outcome of the fight would then be far from clear. In this game Black clearly neglected the principles of correct opening development. His attack on the b2-pawn, which was eventually to prove his undoing, was undertaken at the very moment when he should have given serious thought to developing his bishop on f8 and securing the kind of set-up that would have given him adequate counter-chances in the coming struggle. Such a complicated concept as the modern opening cannot be characterized lucidly in Chapter 1 0 - The Foundations of Opening Theory general terms. We will confine ourselves here to some general hints and advice. Experience shows that as a rule it does Black little good to copy his opponent's moves, in other words to develop symmetrically. This is because White, possessing an extra tempo, is the first in such positions to start resolute action (one of the lines in the Four Knights Game is a characteristic example). Black has to play very carefully in symmetrical situations - it is hard for him to fight for the initiative. This is what explains the fact that in contemporary practice, openings where Black declines to meet l .e4 or l .d4 with l ...e5 or 1 .. .d5 have become so widespread. Don't make it your aim to settle the fight as early as the starting stage. Such tactics can only work against a very weak opponent; usually the results are deplorable. Don't be carried away by winning material in the opening. If the price of winning a pawn {or sometimes even a piece) is backward development or the diversion of key pieces from your position, be very attentive and cautious. If you do decide to go in for such a variation, check the tactical strokes that ensue.

372 The Soviet Chess Primer
We should mention one other important issue. It must be clearly borne in mind that the opening is an organic, integral part of the game as a whole, and in many ways determines its further course. Some players regard the opening as a series of moves of little interest, where nothing is especially critical; once the opening is over (they think), the real struggle begins. Such an attitude is mistaken. Many years ago Alekhine was already pointing out that the division of a chess game into three basic parts (opening, middlegame, endgame) is very much a matter of convention. In practical play it would be more correct, in his opinion, to regard the first part of a game as continuing until the balance is disturbed and a concrete aim emerges; the second part, as he saw it, consists of achieving the aim you have in view. At any rate, when playing an opening you need to be thinking about the plans for the coming struggle, not about arranging your pieces first and only then deciding what you might undertake. Such an unthinking conduct of the opening can have unpleasant consequences. Let's look at the following instructive example: Hukel -Yudovich, USSR - Czechoslovakia Corr. 1 956-8
[diagram]
In this position it is Black to move, and it might seem simplest for him to play 1 0. .. ttlbd7 and resolve the questions of attack and defence afterwards. Yet this natural continuation is not so free from drawbacks. Let us look into the position rather more closely. White's plan is clear. He wants to castle long and then organize pressure against the weak pawn on d6. It's easy to see that defending this pawn is not at all simple. Another fact that complicates the situation is that White may also start an attack on the kingside by advancing his g- and h-pawns at the first convenient opportunity. Now let us return to 1 0. .. ttlbd7. Does this move offer any obstacles to White's development of his initiative? It does not, for after 1 0. .. ttlbd7 1 1 .O-O-O White is already threatening 12. .Be3, and on 1 1 ...ttle8 he plays 1 2.h2-h4. After 1 0. .. ttlbd7, which does nothing to oppose his opponent's designs, Black would probably have to conduct a long and difficult defence. This is why, after weighing up the concrete situation, Black chose a different plan:
10. ..c5 l l. .!e3
After an exchange on f6, Black's bishop would acquire ample prospects on the a1-h8 diagonal. l l. .. �c6 12.O-O-O It looks as if Black has merely worsened his own position; the d6-pawn has now become weaker still, hasn't it?
12. .. t!d4!
Making Black's plan clear; after this invasion he obtains adequate counterplay. Now 1 3. .Bxd4 cxd4 14.Wfxd4 is bad on account of
14. ..
ttld5!.
13.h4 h5 14.Yffl �d7
A sharp situation has arisen, in which Black's Chapter 1 0 - The Foundations of Opening Theory 373 chances are no worse. The opening of this game clearly shows how important it is to link an opening to the coming middlegame struggle. A classic example of correct opening strategy for White is shown at the start of the following game: Alekhine - Rubinstein, The Hague 1 921 l.d4 d5 2.c�:Jf3 e6 3.c4 a6 4.c5 ttlc6 5 . .Bf4 �ge7 6.ttlc3 �g6 7 . .Be3 b6 8.c:x:b6 c:x:b6
9.h4 .Bd6 IO.h5 ttlge7 ll.h6 g6 12 • .Bg5 O-O
13. .Bf6
[diagram]
We have seen what moves brought the players to this unconventional position. But why did White in this game neglect the gradual and logical development of his pieces? Let us quote Alekhine's own words, from his annotations to the game. Of the diagram position, he wrote: ''An unusual position after thirteen moves of a Queen's Gambit! Of these first 1 3 moves, White has made three with his c-pawn, three with his h-pawn and four with a bishop, after which he has achieved, if not a won position, then something close to it." Alekhine goes on to explain why he played that way: "In the opening Black made some eccentric moves (3 ... a6, 5 ... tl::l ge7, 6 ... tl::l g6) which would have given him a good game if his opponent had ignored them (for instance by playing 7.e3 instead of 7 . .Be3, or 9.g3 instead of 9.h4). It was not at all from preconceived motives, but out of necessity, that I advanced my h-pawn to prevent Black from gaining the advantage in the centre." There is an abundance of openings, a multitude of tempting continuations. Which of them do you select, to which ones should you grant preference? It would be wrong if you let your choice be dictated by what our leading players play most often. Bear in mind the great importance of playing in just the way that suits you, the way that is to your liking. This is the true key to success in tournament play. All players have their own tastes in chess. Some like to attack, to sacrifice, to play combinations. Well then, it makes sense for these players to exercise their powers in gambit openings. But then again there are those lovers of chess who like a manoeuvring game, who are not averse to defending. They too can select openings to suit their taste. In general, for players who don't yet possess much tournament experience, settling on open games is more suitable. The strategic ideas of these systems are clearer and simpler than those of half-open and closed games. Opening variations should not be taken on board by "cramming", and learnt by heart. The mechanical assimilation of a series of moves in some line or other is perhaps not difficult, but to say the least it is useless. After all, the very reason why we love chess is that its latent possibilities are boundless. And what if your opponent plays something that isn't in the book? Will you know how to reply to his move? We may say "no" straight away if you have been learning by rote. And yet if you understand the essence of your opening system, if you have mastered its fundamental strategic ideas, you will not be caught off guard by something unexpected.
374 The Soviet Chess Primer
We have already pointed out that the theory of openings in our time has been cultivated in extraordinary breadth and detail. Nevertheless we are still infinitely far from exhausting all the wealth of chess ideas. Variations that you study in a book should of course not be viewed as something wholly indisputable, something established once and for all. The practice of the chess struggle is constantly introducing fresh content into numerous opening schemes; opening lines keep being elaborated and refined. Comparatively recently, many of the schemes we employ today were still held to be of minor importance or even worthless. Let us give some characteristic examples: In Russia in 1 9 1 3, a book by the well-known Moscow master A. Goncharov was published. In this book the Russian player collected together everything of most importance that had been achieved in the openings at that time. Here is what the book had to say after the moves l .e4 e6 2.d4 d5 3.ti:Jc3: ''At this point 3 ... .Bb4 is weak. After 4.exd5 exd5 5 . .Bd3, Black's bishop will soon prove to be of no use on b4; it will later have to retreat with loss of time or else take on c3, presenting the white bishop with a superb post on a3." This view of 3 ... .Bb4 persisted for many years among chessplayers who were theorists, right up until 1 927 when Alekhine, in the first game of his match with Capablanca, showed that the exchange on d5 promises White little. In our day the continuation 3 ... .Bb4 has become a main variation of the French Defence. Today, when the study oftheory has made great advances, when a multitude of contests take place and the number of strong chessplayers increases not by the day but by the hour, it rarely happens that the assessment of fashionable opening lines remains unchanged for long. Many a theoretical variation, before our very eyes, follows a path of blossoming, wilting and blossoming anew, with the possibility of wilting again in the future. As an example, let us look at the fairly old and yet still not concluded history of one variation in the Ruy Lopez: l.e4e5 2.<��f3 lNc6 3.�h5 a64.�a4 ltlf6 5.O-O ltlxe4 6.d4 h5 7.�b3 d5 8.dxe5 �e6 White usually plays 9.c3, preserving his bishop on b3 from exchange and taking control of the important central square d4. In the World Championship Match-Tournament of 1 948, Keres and Smyslov employed a different plan:
9.V*fe2
Intending after 9 ... lt:Jc5 1 0.l"i:d1 lt:Jxb3 1 l .axb3 i.e? to continue with 1 2.c4. The attack with c2-c4 is dangerous even if Black has removed his queen from the d-file. In Smyslov - Euwe (Moscow 1 948 - in the Match-Tournament mentioned), Black played 1 l ...Wfc8 (instead of 1 l .. . .Be7). Play continued: 1 2.c4 dxc4 1 3.bxc4 .Bxc4 14.iMfe4 lt:Je7 1 5.ti:Ja3 c6 ( 1 5. .. .Be6 1 6.lt:Jxb5 is bad for Black) 1 6.lt:Jxc4, and White quickly won. Keres's idea gave rise to a number of interesting variations. Black clearly has no reason to hurry with 9 ... lt:Jc5; 9 ... �e7 Black attends to finishing his development with this move. IO.l"i:dl White still continues as intended, and in answer to Black's 1 Oth move he has a combinative stroke at his disposal: 10 ... lNc5 l l.�xd5 �xd5 12.<�c3 Chapter 1 0 - The Foundations of Opening Theory 375
[diagram]
Which of the opponents does this position favour? How should the subsequent play develop? Let us examine some notable lines. Mter 12 ... ltlb4 1 3.ltle l ! (only not 13.a3, on account of 1 3. .. i.c4 14.1'�xd8t E:xd8 with a strong attack for Black) 1 3. .. c6 14.a3, White obtains a good position. Once it was established that 12 ... ltlb4 is by no means as strong as it looks, the following moves were suggested for Black:
12. ..
J.c4 13Jhd8t gxd8 Once again a scrutiny of all the possibilities began, for both White and Black:
14.%Ye3
White needs to play this move, as 14.�el would be very strongly answered by 14. .. ltlb4.
14. ..
b4 Black now continues the offensive in this way, because 14. .. ltlb4 would be met by 1 5.ltle l . At first sight White has no choice. He has to move his knight to e4, but after 1 5.ltle4 E:dl t 1 6.ltlel Black obtains a very dangerous attack with 1 6. .. ltld4.
15.b3
This clever move was discovered instead of 1 5.ltle4. The idea is to answer 1 5. ..bxc3 with 1 6.i.a3, getting rid of the threat to the back rank and attacking two pieces at once. In view of this, however, Black doesn't take on c3 but withdraws his bishop to e6. To this day many players champion this position for White, while to many it seems promising for Black. Here for instance is what happened in Boleslavsky - Karaklajic, USSR - Yugoslavia team match, Leningrad 1 957:
15. ..
J.e6 16.tLle4 gdl t 17.�el tL!d4
18. .Bb2! tLlxc2 19.%Ye2 gxal 20.J.xa1 tLlxal
21.�xc5 .Bxc5
All these acute moves were analysed by Candidate Master L. Radchenko. Demonstrating an advantage for White is very difficult. If now
22.�b2, then 22 ...
ltlxb3 23.axb3 O-O, and for the queen Black has adequate compensation - rook, bishop and pawn, with an active position.
22.�d3! .Bb6
22 ... Be7 is strongly answered by 23.ltlf4.
23.�xb4 O-O 24.tLlc6 f6 25.h4!
[diagram]
Up to here the game had been following familiar patterns, but in earlier games White had played 25.h3 at this point. Boleslavsky's
25.h4 might not seem to be any improvement
for White, but the whole matter is not so simple. In the subsequent struggle the h-pawn The Soviet Chess Primer advances further, so its position on h4 acquires great significance. 25 ...�h8 26.�h2 .Bd7 26 ... .Bg8 was better.
27.exf6! hc6
The pawn cannot be taken either way, on account of 28.'?Ne7.
28.�e7 E:g8 29.fxg7t
29.f7 is inadequate in view of 29 ...
.Bd5
30.f8=VN E:xf8 3 1 .'?Nxf8t .Bg8, with three
pieces for the queen. 29 ... E:xg7 30.�£8t E:g8 31.�f6t E:g7 32.h5! �g8 33.�xc6 :af7 34.�c3 White soon won. After this, can we say that the variation with the queen sacrifice is discarded outright and relegated to the archives? Of course not. Black too undoubtedly has possibilities for strengthening his play. The assessments have already changed more than once in this variation, and they may change again. They did indeed change after the game Suetin - Geller, 25th USSR Championship, Riga 1 958, in which (after 25.h4) the continuation was: 25 ... fxe5 26.�xe5 :af6 27.g4 .txflt 28.�hl hh4 With an eventual draw. It is now up to White to say the next word, and he will - we can have no doubt about that. Such are the paths of creative investigation that should be followed by all lovers of chess who strive to perfect their play. Any player can join in this great creative work. Is it not interesting to invent new variations yourself, to refute the plans and combinations of chess masters or to find valuable improvements in old theoretical lines? Interesting it is, of course, but by no means easy. To work on chess theory in this way, you need a good deal of knowledge and great persistence. Don't try to tackle everything at once. To begin with, settle on one or two openings that you will play with White, and one or two that you will play with Black. Try to learn as much as possible about the openings you have chosen. Check through their main variations several times, using an openings manual. Play these openings in tournaments and friendly games; this will give you useful experience and acquaint you with the typical positions that characterize your opening. If you study opening systems in this way, you too will possibly succeed in finding major improvements in them - finding "innovations", as chessplayers say. And now, a few concluding remarks on how openings should be studied. You should play through opening variations on a chessboard, looking carefully into the rationale of the manoeuvres involved. You must not simply accept on trust everything written in the handbooks; you need to form an independent assessment of the positions that arise. You are therefore definitely not advised to play through opening after opening, particularly at a fast pace. Opening variations usually end with an evaluation: "White has the advantage", "Black's position is better", "The chances are equal", and so on. Try to understand what these verdicts are based on. Don't forget that at the present time, the opponents in a game will usually be striving for positions that offer a wealth of possibilities for play, and chances for both sides. Thoughtful and expedient preparation of the openings will contribute to your successes in tournaments; it will enrich your play, and help you to learn the art of objective and accurate analysis. Appendix Chess Compositions Chess compositions (problems and studies) are an independent department of chess, separate from the practical game. They present us with artificially constructed chess positions in which we are called upon to carry out a task set by the composer. Thus, their immediate purpose is to set the solver a puzzle; a more elevated purpose lies in the artistic expression of certain chess ideas. The solution of a problem is confined within a prescribed number of moves (for example, mate in two). Studies are free from this limitation - they merely require you to reach by force a position that is clearly won or clearly drawn, according to what the composer stipulates. The composer of problems or studies must fulfil a number of demands. The chief of these is that there should only be one solution and that the position should be constructed economically (with no redundant pieces or pawns). The position must also be legal (that is, it must be one that could possibly be reached in a game from the normal starting position) . Apart from these obligatory requirements, there are some others - so-called "artistic" ones. The latter cannot be considered wholly undebatable, and some of them, especially in the case of problems, are conventional in character, sometimes merely answering to the aesthetic tastes of a particular epoch. The following are examples of concepts recognized in the world of chess problems. A pure mate is when each square round Black's king is denied to him for one reason only (the square is either occupied by a black piece or attacked by a single white one). An economical mate is one in which all White's pieces participate (exceptions are allowed for the king and pawns). A model mate is one that is both pure and economical. However, to require all variations to end in a model mate would be too severe and often unattainable. There are also other requirements, neglect of which is considered a defect, as it detracts from the artistic value of the problem. The first move, for example, is not allowed to be a check (this restriction doesn't apply to studies!) or a capture, or a pawn promotion (particularly to a queen). It is also undesirable for the first move to deprive the black king of square it can move to. All this is understandable, since such primitive methods would rob the problem of its necessary difficulty; they would be improving White's position in a very obvious way. (Usually White is the player presented with the task, and White moves first.) The Soviet Chess Primer
CHESS PROBLEMS
Historically, problems and studies arose out of endgames. But whereas studies give us natural configurations of pieces reminiscent of practical play, such positions are only exceptionally seen in problems. Many practical players don't like this. "White's huge advantage means there's no need for any struggle,'' they say. ''As for finding a mate in two moves when a mate in three is no trouble, this isn't of much importance." Perhaps you too reason in the same way, dear reader. But a struggle is completely beside the point here. The problem challenges your ingenuity. It requires you to discover a surprising move, even {let us say) an incredible one. The expression "problem moves" does not exist for nothing. The brilliance of such moves creates an impression of artistry. The problems given below are deliberately chosen to reflect various epochs, themes and styles. They are united only by their acuity of thought and their power to entertain.

(B) DRAWING PLAY
(White to play and draw) These studies are given separately from those involving winning play, so that the typical methods of defence in the endgame can be brought out more distinctly.
