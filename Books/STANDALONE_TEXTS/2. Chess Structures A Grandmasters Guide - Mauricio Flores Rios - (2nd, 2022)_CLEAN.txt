Name Index Acknowledgements I would like to thank the Quality Chess editorial team for believing in the project this book proposed. In particular I would like to thank David Friedgood and John Shaw for a wonderful job editing my manuscript. The content of this book could not have been presented as well without the he! p of Aura Salazar and Javier Cortes who carefully studied earlier versions of this wor k and provided many useful suggestions to make the exposition clearer. Their questions and criticism encouraged me to expand certain topics and find examples to illustrate my message in a better way. Finally, I would like to thank Aura for encouraging me to regain my ambition in chess, both as a player and trainer. This ambition and her support drove me through the challenging process of writing this book. Foreword I first met Mauricio ten years ago, as we both competed in Pan-American youth competitions. Later we both received a chess scholarship to attend the University ofTexas at Brownsville. We were teammates for four years and spent countless hours studying chess together, though our training preferences were very different. Mauricio read books, analyzed his games and prepared openings. I did these things too, but in reality the vast majority of my time was spent looking over current chess games and playing. I was surprised when Mauricio told me he had written a book partially inspired by my training methods, and I was certainly interested to see what was in it. The truth about my training method is that looking over a game for just a couple of minutes can actually be a wonderful investment, ifdone correctly. The key is searching for repeating patterns; this takes some practice but is feasible. In my career I have seen close to 1 00,000 chess games, including most of the grandmaster-level games played over the past decade. The cumulative experience from spending a minute or two on each of these games has allowed me to gain an excellent positional understanding. Staring at a position for a few seconds is often enough for me to see who is better, which plans will work, which pieces should be traded, etc. Acquiring such a level of experience and positional knowledge requires many years. Going through thousands and thousands of games takes a very long time, even if you only spend a couple of minutes on each. Most importantly, being able to actually see the patterns does not come easily to everyone. Addressing these two difficulties is exactly the purpose of this book. Chess Structures -A Grandmaster Guide is an excellent selection of model games. By studying the 140 games and fragments in this book, the reader will learn many of the most important plans, patterns and ideas in chess. The organization of this book is particularly helpful in this regard. The pawn structure is the most important factor to determine the nature of a game; therefore, studying model games classified by structure allows the reader to acquire reliable strategic knowledge much more easily. Mauricio's detailed explanations allow the reader to identify the key elements in each example. Moreover, each game constitutes a building block toward the understanding of the structure as a whole. I am certain the readers of this book will find it both useful and entertaining. They will complete the opening phase understanding the strategic landscape of the position. Most importantly, studying this book will help them to better understand the opening itself, and even to choose variations depending on what middlegame position they wish to play. I give this book my highest recommendation, and I feel sure readers will profit from it. GM Axel Bachmann Ciudad de!

The book was born out of my desire to guide players who, like me, struggle to apply their strategic knowledge to a practical game. My aim is to provide something new to chess literature; to write the book I should have studied myself earlier in my career. This is not the typical strategy book, but before I tell you what this book is. let me tell you how I realized this book is necessary, especially for self-learners. My progress in chess was very fast, but very difficult, even frustrating. Due to geographical and financial constraints I drew most of my knowledge from books, rather than learning from an experienced master. I studied many strategy books and I remember embracing every word in them as a piece of gold written in ink. However, as I scaled the rating ladder I was dazzled by my inability to correctly evaluate positions despite my supposedly vast strategic knowledge. I was well versed in modern strategy but sometimes the concepts in my books were contradictory, or difficult to apply in practice. I ofcen lost games without ever understanding the reason; my books had no answers! By the time I had become a F IDE Master, I had concluded that the strategic rules in my books only worked sometimes, and this was not good enough. I was afraid to use potentially incorrect rules and I changed my style to avoid dealing with them. I became a strong tactician and avoided strategy at all costs. Unfortunately, I could not always obtain sharp positions and in quiet games my lack of understanding often led me to lose miserably. In fact, I became a grandmaster at eighteen knowing less than half of this book's contents. There already exist dozens of books providing an excellent introduction to chess strategy, and I recommend you read one. These books are a starting point, but they are insufficient. They teach strategic elements without shedding much light on which factors will play a bigger role in a specific position. It is like giving you several tools without telling you which one to use. A different class of strategy book provides many concrete examples and shows how the strategic tools are selected and used. Such books are often entertaining and even inspiring, but they lack specificity. At times reading these books can leave you more confused than before, as you have learned rules but do not exactly knCowhewsshen to apply them. My experience as a coach has only confirmed this phenomenon. Structures -A Grandmaster Guide emphasizes clarity, precision and completeness over generality. I do not intend to teach rules applicable to every position. Such rules typically do not exist. Moreover, even if such rules existed, the chance that such a complex message will be misunderstood is far too high. Let's not risk it! My aim is to provide an easy-to-understand strategic guide to the most frequently-occurring classes of positions in chess. I hope readers will find this helpful, as it greatly reduces ambiguity; it is clear when rules will be valid and when they will not. In this sense, this book is a collection of analyzed model games, logically organized into families of similar positions with common strategic ideas. As Capablanca said in his book Chess Fundamentals, every player should have a collection of games and ideas within his chess knowledge. This book intends to provide developing players with a fine selection of such games and ideas. These games are presented within the context of well-defined classes, to enhance the learning process and prevent confusion. Naturally, the best (and least ambiguous) way to classify chess positions is based on their pawn structure. I divide this book into twenty-four chapters, which discuss the most interesting and
8 Preface
common structures in modern practice. These positions encompass a wide variety of openings and middlegames, which are present in the vast majority of all chess games. I hope my readers will find this book to be a practical and, most importantly, an accessible guide to learning how these specific positions should be conducted. Mauricio Flores Rios Minneapolis, December 20 1 4 Introduction What you will find in this book lbis book is divided into twenty-two chapters describing some of the most important and common structures in chess. Two final chapters contain a compilation of exercises and detailed solutions. Decidingw hi ch structures deserved a chapter, and which did not, proved challenging, but I am satisfied with the final selection. Chapters are ordered so that similar structures are close to one another. In fact, these structures are implicitly divided into five classes or families, each of which is more closely associated with one particular type of opening. Learning all structures within a family is very useful, as players must frequently decide between two options that yield different, yet related, structures. It is helpful to know which structure will prove more favourable. These five families are as follows: Family One: d4 and ... d5 This family consists of the structures that will typically arise when the moves d2-d4 and ... d7-d5 occur early in the game. Typical openings would be the Queen's Gambit Orthodox Defence, the Slav or the Queen's Indian Defence, but there are many others, such as the Scandinavian, the Caro-Kann or the Alapin Variation against the Sicilian Defence. This family encompasses Chapters 1 through 7. In addition, I discuss the Panov structure in the Caro-Kann and the 3-3 vs. 4-2 pawn structure, which are related to this family, in Chapter 22. Family Two: Open Sicilian This family includes those structures that typically occur in the Open Sicilian. It focuses on two types of positions: those that occur when Black plays ... e7-e5 instead of. .. e7-e6; and then Hedgehog and Maroczy positions. This family spans Chapters 8 through 11. The Scheveningen and Dragon structures are discussed in Chapter 22. Family Three: Benoni This small family is devoted to those structures in which Black confronts the queen's pawn opening with a ... c7-c5 strategy and White replies with d4-d5. Later, when Black challenges the centre with ...e7-e6 and ... exd5, White must choose between cxd5 and exd5. Chapter 12 is devoted to studying the first option, which is typically known as a Benoni-type position, while Chapter 1 3 studies the alternative exd5. The related Benko structure is discussed in Chapter 22. Family Four: King's Indian lbis family of five chapters is devoted to the multiple types of structure arising from the King's Indian Defence and its relatives. It is an extremely interesting and complex group of chapters to study, but it contains plenty of tactical and strategic ideas. This family encompasses Chapters 14 to 18. The related structures of the Closed Ruy Lopez and Lopez Formation are discussed in Chapter 22. 1 0 Chess Structures - A Grandmaster Guide Family Five: French This family of three chapters studies the pawn chains that typically arise in the French Defence. It should be noted that such structures often occur in the Sicilian, the anti-Sicilian, the English Opening, the Catalan and many others. It covers Chapters 1 9 to 2 1 . Miscellaneous Chapter As you may see from the list above, Chapter 22 covers many structures. This chapter allows me to discuss structures which are in some sense too "strategically limited" to deserve a full chapter, or simply not so popular. Still, this chapter presents some of the interesting points of these structures, and deserves a close look. Structure selection Naturally it would be impossible to cover every structure. It was a challenge to decide which structures were worthy of inclusion, and which ones were not. I gave priority to the following: Strategic over tactical: I prefer discussing structures with a substantial strategic component. Structures like the Dragon are discussed only briefly in Chapter 22. The reason is that tactics and opening knowledge tend to predominate, offering fewer long-term plans for us to study. Frequent over rare: I gave priority to those structures that arise more often, to offer a practical selection that the reader would be likely to encounter in play. Rare structures are not included. Fixed over flexible: Plans often begin to form after something happens with the pawn structure. That is, pawns are traded, a pawn chain is formed or there is tension in the centre. This creates a semi stable pawn structure. I only chose structures in which this was the case. If there is no pawn contact whatsoever, then multiple options remain open, but the game is likely to reach one of our structures at a later stage. Generally relevant over specific: I tried to avoid structures that occur in only one opening. For this reason, I do not discuss the Exchange Variation of the Ruy Lopez, or the doubled pawn arising in the Trompowsky, or the Winawer or MacCutcheon variations of the French. I do mention the Benko structure in Chapter 22, but primarily because it is relevant to the asymmetric Benoni studied in Chapter 1 2. Exercises The book concludes with a collection of fifty positional and tactical exercises, which reinforce the ideas presented. I attempted to sort these problems from easiest to hardest, but this is merely my own evaluation. If the reader struggles with later exercises, he is likely to find inspiration by solving earlier problems. I provide detailed explanations to all of these exercises. In fact, some of these solutions convey pieces of knowledge that are not thoroughly developed in the corresponding chapter, in an attempt to keep this textbook concise and to make the exercises interesting. The reader is encouraged to first attempt the exercises, and then read these solutions as an additional chapter of supplemental examples. Introduction 11 Game selection The most challenging aspect of writing this book was selecting suitable examples for the concepts I wanted to illustrate. I became so ambitious in my aim to provide a fine collection that I reviewed approximately 20,000 recent games. When I selected games, I prioritized: � Quality of execution �Tactical simplicity, when appropriate � Recent games over older games �Visually appealing games I want this book to explain mistakes made by all levels of players. I certainly did not want to omit those mistakes the best players in the world could make. Excessive tactical complications often make the strategic message rather blurry. Therefore, I avoided sharp tactics whenever it was possible and reasonable. Recent games have obvious advantages over older games. First, the reader is unlikely to bore himself with something he already knows; second, recent games illustrate mistakes players make nowadays, instead of those they used to make in the past. By the past, I mean three, four or five decades ago when strategic knowledge was far less advanced than it is today. Finally, I made an effort to choose beautiful games whenever possible, simply because I would like the readers to enjoy this book. How to use this book I understand many readers have limited time and do not wish to read an entire book if they are only likely to encounter a few of the pawn structures I discuss. For this reason, chapters are largely self contained, while similar chapters will be found close to one another and arranged in a logical sequence. I took great care in ordering chapters so that all required knowledge would be available when needed. Many pawn structures can transpose to another. If structure B is likely to transpose to structure A, then I mention structure A at an earlier stage in the book. When the reader studies structure B, he will be able to understand whether transposing to structure A is favourable or not. This makes the learning process run smoothly and comprehensively. Nevertheless, I would recommend that readers study this book in its entirety even if their current repertoire is unlikely to include all of these structures. Learning new structures opens your mind to new ideas and could do wonders for your chess. Prior works I am aware that other authors have already discussed similar structures as I do in my book. lhis fact drove me to expand this book beyond my original objective. I studied previous works in depth, as my ambition was to produce the most detailed treatment on the subject yet. I am convinced this book will be a great contribution to the study of chess structures. Chapter 1 The Isolani The isolated queen's pawn - referred to here as the isolani - is an extremely important pawn structure. It arises in many opening variations; the Queen's Gambit Accepted, Slav, Tarrasch Defence, Sicilian Alapin or French Tarrasch to name a few. This structure is equally common with either colour, but for our discussion in this chapter we will assume it is White who has the isolani. Generally speaking, White has better middlegame prospects, while Black has better prospects in an endgame. Therefore, White's main aim will be to build an attack, while Black's hope will be to neutralize such an attack and simplify the position, obtaining a superior endgame. Let's discuss some specific plans: White's plans
1. Create a kingside attack. Most standard plans
will include the moves tee5, .lig5 and the battery� d3-.lic2. In some cases a piece sacrifice on the kingside is needed to break through the defence. Rooks are typically placed on e 1 and dl {or cl), and a rook transfer via the third rank is possible.
2. Break in the centre with d4-d5, trading pawns
and opening lines with an overwhelming initiative {or even sacrificing a pawn with the same purpose). 8 7 6 5 4 1
[diagram]
Black's plans 1 . Trade pieces to win an endgame. In particular, exchange White's good bishop {the light 2 squared bishop). Place a knight on d5. This prevents the central break d4-d5, and controls some key squares. In an endgame a rook, bishop or even a king would be strong on this square. As we have seen, the plans in this structure are logical and easy to understand. Playing these positions, on the other hand, can be tricky. Great precision is required when calculating, and a good positional understanding is necessary in order to judge when the isolani provides good attacking chances (or other compensation) and when it is simply a weakness. The games in this chapter show all of these common plans in some form or another. The last two games illustrate an interesting rule for evaluating whether the isolani provides enough attacking chances. As we will learn, che key is whether the player who has the isolani possesses his good bishop. The chapter finishes with a short fragment explaining the power of an isolani which has advanced to the fifth rank.

Black resigned, as he will be a pawn down and cannot stop the advance of the f-pawn. 1-0 Final remarks White won this endgame in a very methodical fashion. The steps he followed were:
1. Attack the d5-pawn to immobilize Black's
pieces, preventing counterplay.
2. Gain space on the kingside, improve his pieces'
3. positions.
Create a second prong to the attack, in this case a passed pawn on the kingside, to decide the game in due course.

We have reached a far less common version of the isolani. White usually has a pawn on the e-file, instead of the c-pawn. Many of the typical plans are still the same, but the lack of White's e-pawn makes his king far more vulnerable, particularly on the a7-gl diagonal.

We have reached the position of interest. Based on the previous games we might think there is generally enough counterplay to compensate for the isolated d5-pawn, but this game proves the opposite. The key factor is the lack of Black's dark-squared bishop, which is often associated with threats along the b8-h2 diagonal. In this game, Black finds himself unable to produce sufficient counterplay, and must passively wait to suffer a painful defeat. Chapter 1 - The Isolani 29

assuming near-perfect play, which even a top player like Bologan was unable to deliver. Chapter 1 - The Isolani Magnus Carlsen - Wang Yue Linares 2009 LInearning objective: contrast to the previous game, the player who has an isolani can obtain good counterplay if he possesses his good bishop.

0-1 Final remarks 1 . Black's decision to accept an isolani was based on two main factors: White's knight would not be useful in an isolani position; Black was rid of his bad bishop and had a good bishop to create critical threats down the b8-h2 diagonal.
2. Despite the comment above, White was
doing okay before the crucial tactical mistake
26..E:el . Without this mistake the most likely
result would have been a draw. Final Comment: lsolani on the Fifth Rank The position in the diagram below occurred in Narciso Dublan - Gonzales Vidal, Badalona 2005. In this position Black continued with the strong: 1 1. ..d4! Now the game takes a somewhat different character. The reader should take a moment to analyze this position, and come to realize Black's position is the more comfortable already, since his isolated pawn is by no means vulnerable on the d4-square, while White's forces are severely constrained. Black will simply proceed by developing his pieces and exerting pressure down the e-file. The alternative 1 1 ...lLie4 12.lLicd4 �c5 1 3.�e3 O-O 1 4.:!k 1 lLixd4 1 5.�xd4 gives White a comfortable position with favourable long term chances since Black's good bishop will be traded.

[diagram]
The pawn structure has been transformed, and the rest of the game bears no relevance to this chapter. What is important is that Black had a pleasant advantage and won very convincingly. This short fragment teaches us how difficult it is to play against an isolated queen pawn once it has reached the fifth rank. Chapter 2 Hanging Pawns The 'hanging pawns structure arises in many openings and is closely related to the isolani. In fact, most hanging pawns arise from an isolani position, in which Black trades his knight on d5 for White's knight on c3. Later, White is likely to advance c3-c4 yielding the position in the diagram. Similar to the previous chapter, this structure is equally likely to arise with either colour, but for the moment we will assume it is White who has the hanging pawns. In general, White has better middlegame prospects due to his control of central squares and his spatial edge. Black, on the other hand, should aim for an endgame or a simplified position in which these pawns are likely to become a liability. In particular, if these pawns become blocked by Black's pieces, then they will become a crucial weakness accounting for an essentially lost position. Now, let's discuss specific ideas for both sides. White's plans 1 . Create a kingside attack. Most plans will include the moves li)e5, �c2, �d3, and a likely rook transfer through the third rank, say with 2 gel-e3-h3. Break in the centre with d4-d5, either to open lines for attack, or to create a powerful passed pawn on the d-file.
[diagram]
Black's plans 1 . Trade off pieces attempting to neutralize the attack.
2. Pressure the central pawns, block them if
possible.
3. Break the hanging pawns, either with
... b6-b5 or ... e6-e5. These breaks are not easy to carry out, especially because an experienced player will try and prevent them at all costs. However, if they can be accomplished they are generally very strong, as they weaken those squares covered by the hanging pawns, and often force White to accept an isolani under very unfavourable circumstances. As the reader will notice, many ideas are shared between this structure and the previous one, and this should not be a surprise. These structures are members of the same family in a general sense. They are both open positions in which White enjoys a pleasant spatial advantage at the cost of some structural instability. Overall, I would say the standard hanging pawns position offers level chances and a complex game with winning chances for both sides. Precise calculation is often required to carry out (or neutralize) the attack and to find the right timing for the central breaks mentioned above. The first two games in this chapter will illustrate 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 Chapter 2 - Hanging Pawns 37 how White may successfully break in the centre with d4-d5. In the first example this break will create a decisive attack due to the opening of lines, while the second example will illustrate the power of a passed pawn advancing down the d-file. The third game is an illustration ofWhite's attacking potential within a modified structure which often arises from the hanging pawns. The last three games in the chapter illustrate (with reversed colours) how Black may play against the hanging pawns.

2. White's pair of bishops played a central role
in many positions. They are very helpful in an open position such as with hanging pawns. Black seemingly underestimated the decisive d4-d.5 break. It was necessary to prevent it, though passive defence would have been unpleasant as well.

The opening stage is over, and it is time to evaluate the position. We have reached a hanging pawns position where both sides have some accomplishments. In Black's favour, two pairs of minor pieces have been traded, reducing the chance of a checkmating attack. In White's favour, the dark squares around Black's king are somewhat weakened, especially since there is no dark-squared bishop to cover them. White has a small opening plus.

White is completely winning due to his passed pawn, while Black is unable to create real threats against the king. I do not include the rest of the game as it is incorrectly transcribed in my database. Final remarks 1 . Having two minor pieces off the board, it was essential for White to provoke the creation of weaknesses with moves likes 1 8 .\Rb2 and
19.0.e5.
2. The creation of a passed d-pawn must be
prevented at all costs. In this game, Stevie should have known he was accepting a lost position after 21 ... exd5, hence he should have played something else, like 2 1 ... l:"i:d6.

This is a typical structure transformation with hanging pawns. The c4-pawn is weakened, while the kingside attack gains strength. A key factor is who gains the initiative after this change. Better was 1 7.E:xe5 ltJd7 1 8.E:e3.

1--0 Final remarks
1. Black's pieces were not very well arranged to
start with. On move 1 7, it would have been better to have a knight on d7 rather than c6, and a bishop on e6 rather than b7.
2. White had multiple opportunities to break
up the centre with b3-b4, all of which worked well due to his well-coordinated forces.
3. After the b3-b4 break the essence of the
advantage is based on White's pieces using the d4-square as a pivot toward the creation of threats. Bartlomiej Madeja -Holden Hernandez Mexico City 20 12 Learning objectives: 1 . Black's imprecise opening play all ows the hanging pawns to be blocked ideally.

Final remarks 1 . Black's opening needs improvement. The hanging pawns will always be inferior if they can readily be blocked as in this game.
2. The break e3-e4 not only forced Black to
accept a weak and isolated c6-pawn, but also opened lines for White's attack. Chapter 3 Caro-Kann Formation The Caro-Kann formation often appears i n the Caro-Kann Defence, the Scandinavian, and the Queen's Gambit Declined (though with the white pawn already on c4) after �'hite plays e3- e4 and Black captures with ... d5xe4. This pawn trade has two major consequences: (1) White gains better control of the centre. (2) White has more space by having the d-pawn on the fourth rank. This structure gives better chances to White in most cases, as Black's pieces are constrained. For this reason, Black's main task is to dispute White's central control by modifying the structure. Now let's discuss specific plans. White's plans The control of the centre opens up multiple opportunities for White everywhere on the board, such as:
1. Creating a direct kingside attack. This is often
accompanied by placing a knight on the e5 outpost, or targeting the weak h7-pawn with the queen and a bishop from d3.
2. Gaining space with c3-c4, h2-h4 and
harmoniously placing pieces to control the centre.
3. Playing c4-c5 to restrict Black's release break
... c6-c5, and to gain control of the d6-square. If White manages to keep Black's counterplay under control, the game will be slow paced and White could even be able to combine some of these plans while Black suffers through passive defence. Black's plans The main objective is to dispute White's centre and transform the structure. This can be achieved by: 1 . Breaking in the centre with ... c6-c5 which usually produces a black 4-2 (kingside/ queenside) versus a white 3-3 pawn structure with roughly level chances.
2. Breaking up the centre with ...
e6-e5 in order to obtain a symmetrical position after White captures with dxe5. This plan is rather unlikely to succeed as many of White's pieces control e5 from their natural squares (d4-pawn, knight on £3, rook on e l , queen on e2).
3. Putting pressure on the d4-pawn once c3-c4
has been played.
4. Challenging White's control of the d5-square
by playing ...b7-b5 once White has played c2-c4. 8 6 5 4 3 2 1 a b c d e g h Family One - d4 and ...d5 As the reader may notice, all of White's plans aim for an advantage, while Black's Plans 1 and 2 are essentially aimed at equalizing. Black's Plan 3 rarely works, as White is able to defend the d4-pawn in most positions. This is why White's position is somewhat superior. le should be noted that Black's Plan 1 is the most likely to be successfully achieved. Outposts Some would say Black can place a knight on his d5 outpost to compensate for White placing a knight on e5; this is certainly not the case. It is unlikely that Black's knight on d5 will create serious threats to White's position. Additionally, White can always push c3-c4 to get rid of this knight if it is absolutely necessary. In contrast, White's knight on e5 is very strong, as it creates threats against Black's king. Black cannot easily expel this knight since ... f7-f6 seriously weakens the kingside. The first three games in this chapter illustrate how White may successfully carry out his Plans 1 , 2 and 3 respectively. Then follow two games which are examples of how Black may successfully carry out the ... c6-c5 break. Finally, the sixth game in the chapter illustrates Black's plan to play ...b7-b5, though White wins the game after the c6-pawn becomes a weakness. 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 The 3-3 vs. 4-2 Structure
[diagram]
As described in the introduction, Black's main plan in the Caro-Kann structure is to achieve the ... c6-c5 break. If this is achieved, White would probably capture with dxc5 after which we would obtain the pawn structure shown in this diagram. Throughout this chapter and subsequent chapters, I will refer to this structure as the 3-3 vs. 4-2 structure simply because of the distribution of pawns. lhis is a relatively simple pawn structure which often offers balanced chances.

2. Black was constantly forced to calculate
White's speculative threats, such as 23.�d3 followed by a potential 24.�xg6 sacrifice. It is possible Maciej a did not even waste a minute calculating such a sacrifice, though Black was obliged to assess whether the sacrifice worked, or otherwise prevent it just to be safe.
3. Black's desperate attempt with ...b7-b5
accelerated the downfall of his position, but the loss was imminent anyway, and White had great flexibility in choosing which winning plan to implement.

As a young chess player I was very puzzled by moves like this. My strategy books had taught me that c4-c5 was a colossal positional mistake since the d4-pawn would be permanently vulnerable as a backward pawn, and the d5-square would be easily controlled by Black's knight. This is all true, but in this pawn structure the c4-c5 move has far more benefits than drawbacks. This move fixes the central structure, permanently banning Chapter 3 - Caro-Kann Formation 59 the ...c6-c5 break and locking in Black's light squared bishop. In addition, the d6-square becomes accessible to a knight, and clearly White's knight on d6 would be far more powerful than Black's knight on d5. Finally, White secures a stable spatial advantage, and the d4-pawn is easily defended in the current position, though it could become vulnerable if White did not proceed correctly. 18 �1-� �an.i.-��r���-I-��a :::: a � w a 0 % A

2. The move c4-c5 prevented essentially all of
Black's attempts for counterplay. In particular, Black's light-squared bishop proved useless throughout the game.
3. l l ...�e7 was a serious mistake, as it allowed
White to seize control of the crucial d6-square, which was essential in White's victory.
4. Finally, this game serves as another example
of White's positional advantage if the breaks ... c6-c5 and ... e6-e5 are impossible. Black's imprecise opening condemned him to this type of inferiority from the very beginning. Chapter 3 - Caro-Kann Formation 61 Conrad Holt - Gata Kamsky Saint Louis 2013 Learning objective: This game is an example of Black's successful ... c6-c5 break followed by an attack against White's king. l.d4 d5 2.c4 c6 3.1Lif3 l!Jf6 4.l!Jc3 a6 5.e3 g6 6.h3 i.g7 7.i.d3 O-O 8.O-O e6 9.b3 ge8 IO.i.b2 f!Jbd7 11.'f!! c2 b6 12.gfdl i.b7 13.e4 dxe4 14. l!Jxe4 1Lixe4 15 .i.xe4 The key position has been reached; Black manages to free his position with the nice sequence: 15 ... £5! 16.i.d3 c5 Black has solved his space problem and now White must play carefully to maintain equality.

We have reached a critical moment in the game. Black's plan is quite clear: he must advance his pawn majority on the kingside and possibly create some threats against the king. White must create counterplay by pushing his majority on the queenside, bur chis is not easy as after b3-b4 the c4 pawn will be vulnerable. Black's position is not necessarily superior from an objective perspective, but the reader should understand that conducting Black's side will be a much simpler task than White's.

0-1 Final remarks 1 . The reader should remember Black's 1 8. .. bxc5. This move played a key role as it made it difficult for White to advance his queenside majority. Meanwhile, Black had a healthy kingside attack based on advancing his central majority. 2 . Although White was objectively no worse until move 33, he lacked targets and his position was quite difficult on a practical level. The key to everything was White's lack of a healthy pawn majority, since the passed c5-pawn was more of a weakness than a threat. Chapter 3 - Caro-Kann Formation 63 Philipp Schlosser - Loek vanWely Belfort 2012 Learning objective: I n this example Black achieves the ... c6-c5 break, and later obtains unpleasant pressure against White's d-pawn, which eventually decides the game. l.c4 c6 2.�0 d5 3.e3 Zlif6 4.�c3 e6 5.b3 �bd7 6.�c2 i.d6 7.i.b2 O-O 8.i.e2 b6 9.O-O Bh7 10.d4 !k8 l l.e4 An alternative is 1 1 .l:'i:acl waiting for Black to take decisive action in the centre; after l l ... c5

His biggest problem was in the opening, as when he played e3-e4 he knew he could not prevent ... c6-c5 which allowed Black to 2 equalize easily. Later, White's mistake was simplifying the position unfavourably with 16.�xd8 and 1 7.it)d2. It seems like White assumed the position would be just equal, but he missed the pressure his d-pawn would face. Then Van Wely imposed his positional advantage with great precision.

1-0 Final remarks 1 . The reader should remember how threatening the ... b 7-b5 break can be. The response cxb5 is often unsatisfactory as it gives up the d5-square permanently and makes White's queenside vulnerable.
2. Allowing Black to achieve the trades ... b5xc4
and b3xc4 enables Black to gain good counterplay along the b-file.
3. For this reason, the most memorable point
in this game was Zvjaginsev's idea l 5.lllf5 followed by 16.tlle3 and later recapturing with lllxc4. This turned the c6-pawn into a permanent weakness, while preventing Black's further breaks with ... c6-c5 or ...a6-a5. Chapter 4 Slav Formation The Slav formation could very well also b e called the Queen's Gambit Accepted formation, as it originates from Black capturing ... dxc4 in a Queen's Gambit position. This structure shares many common features with the Caro-Kann structure we studied in the previous chapter. To start, Black's pawn trade ...dxc4 still results in: I. White gaining better control ofthe centre.
2. White having more space by virtue of a pawn
on the fourth rank. Similarly to the previous chapter, White has a comfortable advantage in this structure, and Black should hope to break free with a central break. Specific plans can be formulated as follows: White's plans The control of the centre opens up multiple opportunities for White everywhere on the board. Similarly to the previous chapter, White has the plans:
1. Creating a kingside attack, this time with h2-
h4-h5-h6 (or hxg6 if applicable) and possibly
2. e3-e4-e5.
Placing knights on the strong outposts e5 and c5, controlling the centre.
3. Playing e4-e5 to fix the centre and control
the d6-square (similar to c4-c5 in the previous chapter). Unlike the previous chapter, White also has the possibility of:
4. Carrying out a minority attack with a2-a4 and
b2-b4-b5, in order to create a weakness on the queenside.
5. Simply gaining space with b2-b4, as well
as preventing the ...c6-c5 break. This is far more likely than playing f2-f4 in the Caro Kann structure, simply because f2-f4 weakens White's king somewhat. Black's plans The main objective is to dispute White's centre and transform the structure. This can be achieved by: 1 . Breaking in the centre with ...c6-c5, probably obtaining a symmetrical position after dxc5, or an isolani after ...
2 Breaking in thec5xd4.
centre with ...e6-e5 will probably produce a 4-2 versus 3-3 pawn structure with roughly level chances.
3. Exerting pressure on the d4-pawn once e3-e4
has been played.
4. Disrupting White's centre with . . .f7-f5 . This
is analogous to the plan ... b7-b5 in the Caro Kann structure. Similarly to the previous chapter, White's plans aim for an advantage, while most ofBlack's plans 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1
70 Family One - d4 and ...d5
aim to equalize by transforming the structure. Black's Plan 3 rarely works, either because the d4-pawn can be easily defended, or because White players know when to refrain from e3-e4, exactly in order to prevent this plan. It should be noted that Black's Plan 2 is more likely to be achieved, since White can often prevent Plan 1 by placing a rook on the open c-file. Outposts Black may place a knight on his d5-outpost, but this knight cannot compete with White's knights placed on the e5- and c5-squares. White can easily push e3-e4 to get rid of the knight on d5, if it is absolutely necessary. In contrast, White's knights on c5 or e5 are harder to deal with, as they are on the fifth rank, and Black cannot easily expel them. Chasing them away with ...f7-f6 and ...b7-b6 would create serious weaknesses on e6 and c6 respectively. The first example in this chapter illustrates White's attacking chances on the kingside, while the second game is an example of White's positional advantage in an endgame in which Black loses by asphyxiation. The third and fourth games are devoted to the central breaks ... c6-c5 and ... e6-e5 respectively. The last game in the chapter is a combination of Black's Plans 3 and 4. The chapter finishes with a short fragment to exemplify White's Plan 3. Levon Aronian -long Yuan Zhao Khanry-Mansiysk Olympiad 2010 Learning objectives: 1 .

2. The advance h2-h4 is typical and

An alternative was 1 4. .. texf4t 1 5.gxf4 .Bd6 1 6.e3 with an approximate balance. The reader should know that White's doubled-pawns are more of a strength than a weakness in this position, as the central mass d4-e3-f2-f4 is solid, offers good control of the centre, and gives White an open g-file to press against Black's king.

3. In retrospect, it might have been objectively
better to play 20.�f4 securing a small positional edge, though practical chances should not be ignored. It is true that Black had one way to maintain equality against White's attack; but how strong does a player need to be in order to find such a precise continuation? The strong GM Zhao was unable to defend, so I believe White's attack is possibly the strongest continuation, at least on a practical level. The key move, Black is defenceless after:

This is a key moment in the game and deserves some comment. With the queens off the board, Black is very unlikely to face a mating attack like we saw in the previous game. But does this mean Black can secure a draw? Not necessarily. Neutralizing White's space advantage is not easy even without queens, and the key question is whether Black will be able to free his position with ... c6-c5 or ...e7-e5 in order to dispute White's central dominance. If that is not the case, White will enjoy a lasting positional advantage and the defensive task will require Black to constantly calculate how to defend against possible breaks, giving him little hope in a practical game where errors cannot be completely avoided.

A practical strategy for White is to continuously present Black with potential threats, but without carrying out any of them until the right time has come. Often White will continue to use this strategy until Black commits a serious mistake, or finds himself in time trouble, and only then will White embark on decisive action.

If Black wishes to equalize, it is absolutely necessary to find a break by either ... e6-e5 or 2 ...c6-c5. The endgame starting on move 19 was nearly lost on a practical level. The reason is that Black could not create any counterplay or find any way to equalize. Meanwhile, White could move his pieces around the entire board, speculating with multiple threats. Even Super GMs like Mamedyarov cannot avoid decisive mistakes under such circumstances. As the reader may have observed in the previous game, White was better in every variation throughout the entire game. Even more significantly, Super-GM Mamedyarov lost without much of a fight, without having committed any major mistakes. So the question is: what is Black supposed to do in order to avoid such a painful loss? My answer to this question is that whenever Black is considering whether to play this pawn structure, he should carefully analyze whether he has reasonable chances to achieve liberation with ... c6-c5 (or ...e6-e5). If these breaks are not possible, he is likely to fall into passive defence. Jon Ludvig Hammer - Magnus Carlsen Sandnes 201 3 Learning objectives: 1 . This game is an example of a position in which Black is likely to achieve the ...c6-c5 break.
2. After the break is achieved, Black has
to parry some threats. But once these threats are neutralized, it is Black who plays for the advantage. l.d4 �f6 2.c4 e6 3.�f3 d5 4.g3 dxc4 5.J.g2 J.h4t 6.J.d2 a5 7.Y!! c2 hd2t s.Y!! xd2 c6 9.a4 The alternative 9.it:)e5 can lead to a complicated position after 9 ... b5 10.a4!? when White has pressure on the queenside and centre, in compensation for Black's extra pawn (or 1 o. it:)xc6 V!!c7 = ).

We have reached the position of interest, and the reader should pay close attention to the differences between this game and the previous one. In the current game, two minor pieces are Chapter 4 - Slav Formation 77 off the board already, decreasing Black's space problem. In addition, the moves a2-a4 and ... a7-a5 greatly favour Black, as they give a strong square for the knight on b4 and have eliminated White's chances to expand on the queenside in thhaes afutureconc with the usual b2-b4. Finally, Black rete plan, which is ...b7-b6, ...�a6 (or ... Bb7) followed by placing the rooks in the centre and pushing ... c6-c5.

2. A crucial role was played by the weakening

the d4-pawn will not always work. It works particularly well in this game because Black's bishop was on g7, and because White's pieces were poorly placed to begin with.
3. The break ...
f7-f5 is an important move in Black's strategy, undermining the control of the d5-square.
4. The idea of ...
f7-f5, followed by trading pawns on e4 and playing ... e7-e5, is thematic and strategically sound, as it turns the e4-pawn into a permanent weakness. Black has a healthy extra pawn, and won this endgame without difficulty after: Chapter 4 - Slav Formation 85 I decided to finish this chapter with a short fragment from the game Andreikin - Kramnik, Dortmund 201 3.

White continued with:

Fixing the centre and preventing Black from eventually releasing his position with ... e6-e5. It should be noted that the advance e4-e5 has some crucial differences compared with the advance c4-c5 we studied in the previous chapter. Most importantly: l. White gains direct chances for an attack since the e5-pawn controls the important f6-square.
2. Black is far more likely to achieve ...c6-c5 in
this position than he was to achieve ...e6-e5 in the previous chapter.
3. In the previous chapter Black's light-squared
bishop was completely restricted. Since ... c6- c5 is not exactly impossible, Black's bishop can find some activity from the b7-square.
4. There exists a possibility to break White's
centre with ... f7-f6 since White cannot easily play f2-f4. In contrast, in the previous chapter White could almost always respond with b2- b4 against Black's ...b7-b6. Similarly to the previous chapter, the d4-pawn is not really vulnerable, and Black is rather unlikely to gain anything from placing a knight on the d5-square. If White plays 1 I ..\Bd3 ltld7 12.O-O? {it was not too late for 1 2.e5!) 1 2. ..e5! Black equalizes completely. 1 1 ...

This is a position to remember: White is in complete control of the game and the weakness of the backward d4-pawn is only symbolic. Black continued with 16. ..c5 accepting a permanently weak c-pawn, which led him to lose. The rest of the game is irrelevant to our study, but the reader should carefully examine the differences between the e4-e5 and c4-c5 advances, contrasting this chapter and the previous one. Chapter 5 The Carlsbad Formation The Carlsbad, also known as the Orthodox Exchange formation, is a very well-known and thoroughly studied pawn structure. In fact, it is one of the few pawn structures which has received the attention other structures in this book deserve. The Carlsbad can be reached from many different move orders, and in some cases with reversed colours, such as in the Caro-Kann after: l .e4 c6 2.d4 d5 3.exd5 cxd5. Despite this fact, every game presented in this chapter will have White and Black playing the roles as presented in the diagram at the top of this page. White's plans This position offers two main lines of attack for White: 1 . Pursuing the so-called minority attack with b2-b4-b5 in order to create a queenside weakness.
2. Pushing f2-f3 and e3-e4 (or sometimes e3-e4
directly) gaining central space and creating tension. Given any position, it is likely that only one of these plans will work well. This will depend on how the pieces are arranged, and how Black's queenside structure is set up. For example, the character of the game can change dramatically if Black's pawns are set up as a7-b6-c7 instead of
[diagram]
the more typical a6-b7-c6. In addition, White's queenside plan is less likely to work if the light squared bishop has been developed on g2. Black's plans 1 . The main plan is to place a knight on e4 and to create a kingside attack, but this is not always possible. For example, White might choose a set-up in which f2-f3 is included
2. The most common auxiliary plan is to play
... b7-b6 and ... c6-c5 in order to transpose into a hanging pawns position. Or sometimes just ... c6-c5 is played directly, hence dxc5 transposes into an isolani.
3. An important though far less common plan is
to play ... b7-b5 once White has played b2-b4, in order to obtain a firm outpost for a knight placed on c4. This plan is less common because ... b7-b5 also creates a weakness - a backward c6-pawn, which could cause this plan to backfire. The first game in this chapter illustrates how necessary it is for White to place his dark-squared bishop outside the pawn chain (say on g5 instead of d2). The second game is an ideal execution of White's minority attack, while the third is an example of Black neutralizing this plan after some precise moves. The fourth game in the 8 6 5 4 3 2 Chapter 5 - The Carlsbad Formation 87 chapter explains how White must react if Black's queenside is arranged as a7-b6-c7. The last two games show the consequences of White carrying out the e3-e4 break first successfully and then unsuccessfully. Nicolai Getz - Simen Agdestein Fagernes 2013 Learning objectives:
1. It is bad for White to have a Carlsbad
structure with the dark-squared bishop inside the chain.
2. This game illustrates how Black will
easily gain control of the e4-sq uare and later develop a kingside attack. I.d4 �£6 2.c4 e6 3.�c3 d5 4.�a ro 5.e3 �bd7 6.�c2 .Bd6 7..Bd2 0--08.cxd5?!

Of course Black retakes with ...exd5 heading into a Carlsbad structure under favourable circumstances. The reader should remember the reason: White's dark-squared bishop is inside the pawn chain and, compared to a powerful bishop on f4 or g5, it is rather useless on d2. 9. .Bd3 The very same Agdestein (Black in the current game) went for this line 20 years before, though he continued 9.O-O-O :Be8 IO�d3 c5! when Black has a preferable position due to his strong initiative on the queenside, as in the game Agdestein - Shirov, Gausdal 1992.

!!ac8 was somewhat unexpected, but very important, as the break ... c6-c5 played a crucial role in many variations. I hope this game leaves a strong impression on the reader.

I would like to paraphrase something my former coach Bartlomiej Macieja said to me about a year before I wrote this book. He said, "People usually talk about good and bad bishops, but it should be quite clear that White's bad bishop is rather powerful on f4 or g5." That is, White's 'bad' bishop is actually an excellent piece as long as it is outside the pawn chain, unlike the previous game. Hence it makes sense for Black to trade it with: l l.. .i.d6 12bd6 Wlxd6 13.O-O This is a standard set-up for this pawn structure; in fact there are over 1 00 games in my database with this exact position. l3 •• .i.e6 Another option was: 1 3. ..�e? 1 4.:\%ab l ltJe4 1 5.b4 a6 I 6.a4 (If 1 6.he4 dxe4 1 7 .ltJd2 .Bf5 chances are level.

Everything is being played according to modern theory; in fact there are over 250 games with this position. One should pay close attention to Black's pawn structure on the queenside. The most typical Carlsbad structure has pawns on a6-b7-c6-d5, which makes the b4-b5 break quite powerful In this case, it might seem that White has little to hope for since b4-b5 does not create any weak pawns, but this is not quite the case. White's plan is to first gain some space on the queenside with b4-b5 and a3-a4, weakening the c6-square and "isolating" the d5-pawn, and then either play �a3xd6 in order to weaken the c7-pawn, or blow up the centre with e3-e4. In both cases, Black's coumerplay is associated with placing a knight on e4 and then creating a kingside attack, possibly through ... f7-f5 and ...g6-g5, as illustrated in the note to Black's 1 0th move.

1--0 Final remarks I . Whenever Black arranges his pawns as in the game, with a7-b6-c7, White must carefully analyze whether he will be able to dispute Black's control of the e4-square. If that is not che case, something is likely to go wrong.
2. If White can dispute the e4-square, then the
plan b4-b5 followed by an eventual e3-e4 is very powerful, as it opens many lines for attack. Positionally, it also makes sense, as Black's backward c7-pawn and the c6-square may become vulnerable after e3-e4, especially iflight-squared bishops are traded on e4.
3. Finally, Black had nothing to hope for down
che a-file or on the queenside for that matter. Hence Black's 1 3th move proved to be an utter waste of time.

It may b e too soon fo r my assertion that Black has a clear advantage, but after analyzing the rest of the game the reader might start to agree with me. From a strategic point of view, matters are quite clear, as White has reached an endgame where the isolated d4-pawn is nothing but weak and blockaded. White's bishop on f4 has no targets whatsoever and sees its action restricted by its own pawns. All Black needs is patience and some creativity to find the right plan, which Efimenko does quite well.

2. The reader might think Kuzubov did not know
what he was doing, as he left his dark-squared bishop inside the pawn chain. This is not the case: the dark-squared bishop can be inside the pawn chain as long as White is planning the break e3-e4 which would render this bishop useful again.
3. White's opening did not achieve more than
equality. White lost the game because after e3-e4 was played, his inaccuracies forced him into an i nferior endgame. A crucial mistake was the slow 1 9.\tih2 steering White into passive defence. 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 Chapter 6 Stonewall The Stonewall structure often arises from the Dutch Defence, the Slav or the Catalan, the first being the most common. It could also occur with reversed colours, but this is relatively rare. Of all the pawn structures we study in this book, the Stonewall has one of the worst reputations. Players from a wide range of levels would say the idea of playing ... d7-d5 together with ... f7- f5 is positionally unsound. There is partial merit to this claim, as the e5-square becomes permanently vulnerable. Whether this vulnerable square actually becomes a serious weakness often determines whether Black's position is good or not. To be honest, I myself considered the Stonewall to be a relatively bad structure until I started researching it in orderto write this chapter. In fact, I originally wanted to make this chapter a manual on how to defeat this pawn structure. After a substantial amount of work I gave up on this aim, and instead decided to accept that the Stonewall is a solid system which deserves serious consideration. I hope this chapter will be enough to convince the reader that this is the case. Then why does the Stonewall have a bad reputation? I believe this is the effect of two types of observational bias: I . White's wins in the Stonewall are often visually pleasing and positionally convincing. They are
[diagram]
likely to be used as examples in strategy books. This decision unintentionally conveys the idea that the Stonewall is positionally incorrect.
2. Black's wins are often based on tactical
resources of some sort, hence they can often be considered "accidental" rather than meritorious. Many players (including myself before writing this chapter) would skip those games without further study, simply thinking: "Black was just lucky, this will not happen to me." Personally I was surprised on checking my database to realize that among IM and GM level games, White only scores about 54% with the openings presented in this chapter. This is basically a standard result, nothing special. Hence, statistically the Stonewall is slightly inferior, but no worse than many well-respected systems. OK, that is enough defending the Stonewall, now let's discuss typical plans. White's plans
1. Obtaining firm control of the e5-square;
placing a knight on this square.
2. Trade dark-squared bishops to further weaken
3. Black's dark squares.
Expand on the queenside or open the c-file at a favourable stage and pursue an invasion down this open file. 1 04 Family One - d4 and ... d5 Black's plans 1 . Create a kingside attack, but without completely losing control of the central squares.
2. I mprove the bad bishop with the manoeuvre
... .itd7-e8-h5 or sometimes ... b7-b6 followed by ... .lta6.
3. Create central tension with ... b7-b6 followed
by ... c6-c5. Before proceeding, I would like to clarify Black's plans somewhat. First, for Black's Plan 1 to succeed, the control of the central squares is essential. If White has undisputed control of the e5-square, then most of Black's attacking attempts will fail. A healthy attack for Black will keep a balance between fighting for the e5-square and advancing on the kingside. Black's Plan 2 is important and useful, but not always necessary. Black can find a good position even with his bishop on the humble d7-square. Finally, Black's Plans 1 and 3 should certainly not be combined. The point of Plan 1 is that the Stonewall creates a solid central structure, making a flank attack feasible. The attack would probably fail if the move ... c6-c5 had already been played. This chapter begins by showing one short example of White's dream position in the Stonewall, simply to illustrate everything Black should fight to avoid. The second and third games are examples of White's successful strategy, controlling the centre and keeping Black without counterplay. The last three games in the chapter illustrate Black's ideas for counterplay by showcasing Black's Plans 1 , 2 and 3 in that order. Sandro Mareco - Chithambaram Aravindh Golden Sands 201 3 Leaming objective: This game fragment essentially illustrates everything that could go wrong with Black's position, and how White may win convincingly under those circumstances.
[diagram]
As the reader may notice, White is doing extremely well in this game. To be thorough and comprehensive, let's outline exactly what is good about White's position: 1 . The key e5-square is under complete control.
2. It would require about four moves for Black
to remove White's knight on e5, say with ... E:f6-f8, ... l!:Je8-f6-d 7.
3. Black's bishop is complerely locked in by his
pawns; there is no route into the game.
4. Black's kingside pawns are not flexible. If the
g4-pawn could go back to g5, then at least it would be possible to play ... f5-f4 with a semblance of counterplay.
5. There is no real chance for Black to attack
along the h-file. A plan like .. J'�h6, ... 'lffg5-h5 is far too slow and momentarily impossible due to White's queen on d2.
6. White's pieces are very well coordinated.
7. White has an immediate queenside break with
a2-a4. 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 Chapter 6 - Stonewall 105 This is exactly the kind of example that strategy books use, giving the impression the Stonewall is just bad. Of course, this position is just bad, but there are many things Black could have done to avoid such a disaster. For now, let's simply observe how White exploits his monumental advantage.

Notice that if Black had a rook on a8 and a pawn on a5, the position would be far more difficult to win, since this move would be answered by ...b5-b4, blocking the queenside.

Black resigns as his entire position falls apart.

Note that Black's light squared bishop will come into the game after ... c6-c5. This is the first critical moment in the game. Black's main problem is to find a good use for the light-squared bishop. The typical .. �d7- e8-h5 manoeuvre will not benefit Black since White simply responds with f2-f3. Hence, the only alternative is to place the bishop on the a8-h l diagonal and advance ... c6-c5. On the other hand, White's objective will be to play c4- c5 obtaining a lasting advantage by restraining Black's bishop permanently.

19. ..
ibf7? This is a colossal mistake that should be well understood by the reader. Before playing this move Black had reasonable fighting chances, since White's pieces could not be mobilized so easily. The e5-pawn was vulnerable, hence natural moves, like moving the bishop away from b2 or playing l0d4, were impossible. If White had played f3-f4, then Black could have responded with ... l0e4. It was better to prepare ... b5-b4 with 19 ... E:fb8, for example: 20.b4 l"!a7 when Black can create some counterplay down the a-file, or 20.�d4 b4 21 .a4 (21 .E:al !?! was better) 2 1 ...�c8 followed by .. �a6 with a reasonable position for Black. But now thar Black has played ... l0f7, the following move is logical and very strong:
20.f4±
Black's knight does not have a route back to e4, hence weakening the e4-square is not a problem at all. From this point I think Black's position is nearly lost, and the reader should pay close attention to how White manages to gradually increase his advantage without giving Black any hope of counterplay.

1e8 32.b4 This is played in order to support the c5-pawn, as White wants to use his rook on the kingside. 32 ...a4 Having a closed queenside, the rest is just a matter of technique.

This move is logical and very strong. It might seem premature, but after this move Black's position is already dearly lost, for the following reasons: I . White has a significant spatial advantage, allowing him to manoeuvre freely with his
2. pieces.
Only White can open the position favourably, which he will do only once allhis forces are
3. ready for the final invasion.
Black's light-squared bishop is locked in and 4 cannot contribute to Black's play. With the last move, White shows the beginning of the winning strategy. His first step is to play i.c3-e l-h4 to make good use of his bad bishop.

1-0 Final remarks 1 . Black's first mistake was allowing White to play c4-c5, which prevented ... c6-c5, hence restricting the light-squared bishop. This was essentially an opening imprecision. It was necessary to play l 2 ... i&c5 or l 4 ... ltJc5.
2. The second mistake was to play 1 9. ..

Black's light-squared bishop can always become active after a timely ...dxc4 opening the a8-h 1 diagonal. For these two reasons, White should be particularly cautious, and not expect the usual solid position against the Stonewall.

White does not want to admit that 12.f3 was simply a weakening move, hence he accepts the challenge. Unfortunately for him, Black's attack is even stronger than it seems.

He had a dear chance to equalize with 1 8.f4, and even 19. f4 was better than this position. Black's strategy has succeeded in every way. Let's spell out why:
1. Black does not have to worry about a weak
e5-square. Instead, White has a weak e5-pawn to worry about.
2. There is pressure down the f-file, thanks to the

A crucial factor in Black's choosing to pursue the plan ... c6-c5 was that his pieces were already well arranged for it. Black probably would not have started that plan from scratch had other plans been readily available.
2. It should be noted that it was a good decision
for Black to convert the game into a Stonewall on move 1 2, as White did not have a clear way to execute any of her plans. The e5-square was hardly accessible and it was impossible to expand the queenside. Chapter ? Griinfeld Centre The structure studied in this chapter typically arises from the Griinfeld Defence, and occasionally in the Nimzo-lndian Defence, in which case the e7-pawn will be on e6, but this does not affect the essence of the strategy. It rarely occurs with reversed colours unless White is deliberately attempting to play a Griinfeld with an extra tempo. Although there is central tension in the position presented, the most likely outcome is that pawns will be traded on d4, after which the c-file will be open, leaving White with a central pawn majority and Black with a queenside pawn majority. This will be a central theme across all positions of this type. Let's outline plans for each side: White's plans
1. Create a central passed pawn with d4-d5,
dominate the centre, gain space.
2. Create a kingside attack, which will probably
include the moves h2-h4-h5 and e4-e5 to gain control of the f6-square, which is usually weakened when Black develops his bishop on g7. Black's plans 1 . Create a queenside passed pawn, especially after some simplifications.
2. Pressure the centre, place a rook on the d-file
and find tactical resources associated with the open position. In general White will get pretty good middlegame opportunities since he dominates the centre and has a little more space. This advantage disappears rather easily, as the position is open and Black has multiple opportunities to trade off pieces heading into a good endgame. One major factor in this position is the control of the c-file. If White controls the c-file it will be easier for him to expand, to create a passed pawn, to neutralize Black's play. Likewise, if Black controls the open file, White's central or kingside play will face many difficulties. One may say that open files are always important, which is often true. But in this position the open file is even more important than usual - it is essential. The first three games in chis chapter will illustrate the importance ofthe c-file, and through these exam pies we will see how White can create a central passed pawn and win the game. In the third game it is Black who creates pressure by controlling the c-file, and eventually obtains a near-winning endgame. The last two games are devoted to the study of White attacking with the e4-e5 advance. In the first of these White's strategy proves successful, while in the second example Black manages to neutralize the threats to obtain a very superior endgame which is won with high class.

The reader should examine this position carefully, as there is more than meets the eye. Players of all levels could glance at this position and say, "Chances are level." Even my engine agrees with this evaluation. In practice matters are not that simple at all. Black experiences some difficulties, as the e 7-pawn is under attack, the a6-pawn is vulnerable, and White intends to take control of the c-file. Black could solve his problems by playing two moves in a row: ... 1&d7 and ...�c4 momentarily blocking the c-file. Having only one move, Kasparov failed to cope with his difficulties, and played:
21...geS?!
In the post-mortem, Kasparov referred to this move as a positional blunder, saying that after losing the c-file his position was "completely lost". He probably exaggerated, but the point is clear: fighting for control of the c-file is an essential task in this kind of position. A better choice was 2 l . .. ltJc4! 22.il.xe7 l"!e8 (but not 22 ... ltJb2? 23.1&d2 ltJxd 1 24.il.xf8 winning a pawn) 23.il.a3 (23.il.g5? ltJb2-+) 23 ... ltJxa3

2. The entrance of the rook by 26.Ei:c6 aggravated
Black's situation very much, as the rook pressures a6 and allows the doubling of the major pieces with � c2.
3. The idea of trading bishops was excellent,
in order to clear the entry point c7, without which White cannot make much progress.

The beginning of a mistaken plan. I somehow wanted to play safe in this game by trading several pieces early on, and hoping for an easy draw. Let's see what happened.

And here I was. After trading three minor pieces I thought my position was very close to equal, and heading for a relatively easy draw. There is great similarity between this position and the previous game, but unfortunately for me, I was unfamiliar with that game at the time, hence I was in unknown territory from a strategic perspective and I did not yet know how bad my position was. The reader should carefully examine this position and appreciate Black's difficulties. First, one of White's main plans in this pawn structure is the creation of a passed pawn on the d-file, which Wesley is not very far from, since his d-pawn has already reached d5. Second, the c6-square is weakened, which probably will help White gain control of the c-file, just as in the previous game. Finally, Black's coumerplay is ofren based on advancing his majority on the queenside, but we know this is not going to happen soon enough; thus Black is just playing a waiting game, hoping to survive. Overall, this position is probably just a slight advantage for White, but it is extremely difficult for Black to play, as there is not a clear-cut plan, and there are many things to worry about.

8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 Chapter 7 - Griinfeld Centre 127 With perfect play, it is impossible to say if this is a forced win or just a draw. But White can comfortably play for a win for as long as he wants to, and should expect to score about 80% of the points, as passive defence is always difficult. As an example, I offer this variation: 22 .. . .Eld8 23.e5 e6

The alternative 1 7. ..�c5?! blocking the c-file can be met by 1 8.�h6 .Ele8 1 9.e5 when White has good attacking prospects, aside from the potential threat of creating a central passed pawn.

Preparing White's two main ideas: the creation of a passed pawn with e4-e5 and d5-d6, and the control of the c-file with !lb 1-c1-c6. Black cannot prevent both.
18. .�e5
At this point I started to realize that I was in serious trouble, since I had lost the c-file. In particular, I was disappointed to realize that after 1 8. .. �d7 1 9.e5 Black has nothing to do other than wait, while White has a pleasant choice between the strong breaks e5-e6 and d5-d6. 1 9. .. .Elfe8 20.�e4 .Elac8 21 .g3!?

Without it, Black will be limited to a very difficult, 2 passive defence. Most importantly, this game illustrates the importance of studying model games for each structure, as we do in this book. Had I known the Karpov Kasparov game beforehand, I certainly would have known how to play this position type, and I would have known what variations to avoid.

We reach a critical moment in the game, as White has to determine what pawn structure to p1l8a.y. e4? This move is a serious misjudgement, converting the game into a Griinfeld-type position under unfavourable circumstances. The reader should compare this position to the previous two games and understand why White's move is a mistake. In these games, particularly in So Flores, White had two strong plans in hand: creating a passed pawn on the d-file, and controlling the c-file with his major pieces. In this position Black is well prepared to meet both plans, and it is White who does not have the time to fight for the c-file, due to the vulnerability of his central pawns. A sound decision was 1 8.�ffd 1 lbf6 1 9 .8acl with level chances.

On the negative side, it may permanently weaken the d5 square, and it often gives up the possibility of creating a passed d-pawn, as Black can simply neutralize the majority with the standard ... e7-e6.

The key to this game was the timely e4-e5 advance, which gave White all the benefits but none of the drawbacks of this move.
2. The disadvantage in placing a knight on a5 is
that after e4-e5 it takes many moves to reach the d5-square. By the time this knight reached d5, Black's camp was already far too weakened. 1 34 Family One - d4 and ...dS Yuri Vovk - Andrei Volokitin Kiev 201 2 L1.e Tarning objectives: his game illustrates how Black may neutralize %ice's kingside attack after e4-e5 has been played.

This is a critical posmon in the game. By advancing e4-e5, %ire has created some attacking prospects on the kingside, while at same time weakening the d5-square and losing the option of creating a passed pawn on the cl-file. The reader should compare this position to the previous game, and realize that Black is much better prepared to meet this advance in this position, since he does have a light-squared bishop to create counterplay down the a8-h 1 diagonal. Overall, chances are approximately balanced.

The plan was to simplify the position and neutralize the kingside attack in order to go into an endgame with these characteristics. Black will obtain a remote passed pawn, probably on the a-file, while White cannot advance his extra pawn on d4. This position is an example of White's biggest fears when playing the double edged e4-e5. It is possible that Vovk estimated that he should be able to hold this position, but this task is actually very far from trivial as we shall see.

32 ... Qh6! Intending to invade the kingside. White faces a very difficult dilemma: should he race to the queenside, attempting to capture the a-pawn, and then try to return to the kingside before it is too late? Or should he wait on the kingside, risking zugzwang? Chapter 7 - Griinfeld Centre 1 37

39 ...�d5 4o.iif2 �xf4 0-1 Final remarks 1 . The key moment in the game was after 26 ... 1&c3. White's kingside play had not been completely neutralized (there were at least chances for perpetual check), hence White should have kept the queens on.
2. It is possible that White did not properly
evaluate the knight ending. The strength of a remote passed pawn should not be underestimated.
3. The move 28 ... a5! was very important,
choosing to keep a passed a-pawn rather than a b-pawn, because the further away the pawn is from the white king, the harder it is to stop it.
4. Black's creation of a kingside passed pawn
with 35 ...g5! is a beautiful illustration of the concept of creating two fronts, which defined the game. Chapter 8 NajdorfType I The structure studied in this chapter is typical of many Open Sicilians. It arises after White trades pieces on d5, and recaptures with the e-pawn. This frequently occurs in the Najdorf variation, but I should emphasize it is not limited to this variation. For example, we can obtain this structure after the sequence l . e4 c5 2.li:Jf3 li:lc6
3.d4 cxd4 4.li:lxd4 li:lf6 5.tt:lc3 e5 6.tt:ldb5 d6
7.li:Jd5 li:lxd5 8.exd5. This structure deserves
careful study as the recapture exd5 dramatically changes the character of the game. Even players of the highest level transform their position with this recapture without properly assessing their chances in the resulting position. This structure provides a natural imbalance and offers interesting chances to both sides. The main plans are: White's plans 1 . Advance the queenside majority with b2-b4 and c2-c4-c5.
2. On some occasions, after Black has played
...f7-f5, it is also possible to place a bishop along the b l -h7 diagonal and play g2-g4 breaking up Black's structure. This plan is rare, but when it works it does so spectacularly well. Black's plans 1 . Expand on the kingside with ... f7-f5 and develop a kingside attack.
2. Restrict or undermine White's queenside
expansion with a potential ...b7-b5. Bad bishops A recurring theme in these positions is the fight between White's light-squared bishop and Black's dark-squared bishop. Both of these bishops are considered bad according to classical strategic theory, as they run on the same colour as their respective most-advanced pawns (on d5 for White, e5 for Black) . As we will learn in this chapter, Black's dark-squared bishop is not bad at all, while White's bishop is often restricted and even useless in some positions. This is a rule to be remembered. General strategy books would nor teach us this rule, but we should remember it as an essential strategic element in this particular structure . The first game in this chapter is the relatively well-known game Grischuk - Zhang Zhong from 200 1 , in which White carries out a powerful queenside expansion to create a winning passed pawn. Later Zhang Zhong manages to create illustrative kingside counterplay which emphasizes Black's many attacking possibilities.
[diagram]
Chapter 8 - NajdorfType I 139 The second game is an example of White's queenside expansion, followed by a strong kingside break with g2-g4. The third game is one from my own experience: a race between Black's kingside attack and White's passed central pawns. The last two games illustrate Black's plans in the fight between the bishops. The first of these examples is a positional treatment, while the second is a sharp tactical approach, both yielding convincing victories to Black. Alexander Grischuk-Zhang Zhong Shanghai 2001 Learning objectives: 1 . The phase of this game after the diagram exemplifies how White can convert his queenside expansion into a winning passed pawn.
2. Then Black launches an interesting
kingside counterattack, which illustrates many of the most typical attacking resources in this position.

The essential element in trading those knights is whether Black will be able to play ... a6-a5 preventing b2-b4. If that is the case, then Black will generally do well since the queenside play loses most of its strength.
2. The bishop transfer id 1-c2 followed by the
kingside break g2-g4 is extremely powerful.
3. After analyzing this position one might be
left with the impression that Black's kingside play is not really going anywhere if White knows his way around. In the game this was true, but Black could certainly have improved his chances with the safer 1 4. ..e4 as suggested above.

The reader should study this position carefully, as it is essential for the understanding of the chapter. As we have studied in the previous games, White's plan is to accomplish an expansion on the queenside with the usual b2-b4, c2-c4-c5; we know this is not going to happen in this game. Still, it is possible for White to open the queenside with c2-c3, but is this really going to help? The answer is no. There is a bigger factor hiding in the positional background and the reader should learn this once and forever. White's biggest problem is the qualitative difference between the bishops. Although both bishops are momentarily blocked, only Black's bishop has active prospects, either on the diagonal a l -h8, or the diagonal gl -a7. Meanwhile, White's bishop will be a spectator throughout the entire game. It is not uncommon for players of the white pieces (even at the top level) to go into this kind of position without seriously accounting for this problem, and this game is a wonderful illustration of how to convert Black's positional advantage into a full point.

This is a good moment to stop and reflect upon the last few moves. Black has achieved the typical expansion ... f7-f5, placed a bishop on the strong f2-a7 diagonal, and opened the a-file, which he is now ready to invade. Meanwhile, White has accomplished absolutely nothing. I am certainly not trying to say that Judit Polgar has been completely outplayed; in fact both players have made some inaccuracies. My point is that the position after move 1 7 gives Black excellent prospects and very clear plans, while White does not have constructive ideas, and even the very best players would struggle to find something productive to do.

It seems as if White has been heading toward this position since l 1 .lllxc6, and here we are. Was this a good decision? Based on what we have learned in the previous games, the answer is "Definitely not!" White's standard plan in this position is to expand his majority on the queenside, but this is unthinkable after queenside castling. Moreover, the bishop on b3 is restricted by its own pawns, basically doing nothing, while Black's bishop on f6 has a strong potential to Chapter 8 - NajdorfType I 1 53 press against White's king, say after the typical pawn sacrifice ...e5-e4! Objectively speaking, this position is slightly better for Black, but in practice Black already has a big advantage since White has no real targets to attack. 16J:td3 Attempting to neutralize Black's attack through active play on the queenside.

0-1 Final remarks 1 . In both this game and the previous one, Black's bishop played an essential role in attacking White's king. This time, Black used the strong diagonal al-h8.
2. This battle was even more imbalanced than
in the previous game, as White's king on the queenside basically prevents any attempt to expand the queenside majority. Chapter 9 Najdorf Type II Just as in the previous chapter, I shall emphasize that this structure is not only typical of the Najdorf, but rather many other variations in the Sicilian, such as 1 .e4 c5 2.itJf3 ltJc6 3.d4 cxd4 4.ltJxd4 e5 5.ltJb5 d6. This structure is one of my favourites, as it provides a nice mix of tactical resources and strategic ideas. I grew up playing the English Attack against the Sicilian, and played this pawn structure many times. I enjoyed opposite flank attacks and most of my games took this direction for good or for bad. 1his chapter will not focus on these attacks. I will admit they are very exciting and complex, but they lack the strategic substance that constitutes the essence of this book. Instead we will focus on the strategy that hides behind the combinations. In this structure, all strategic plans are in some way connected to the control of the d5-square. As the reader can easily verify on his own, pretty much every successful attack in this position works out because such central control has been achieved. Now, let's examine how each side may fight for the d5-square: White's plans I . Place a knight on d5, and have enough pieces to always be able to recapture with a piece rather than a pawn.
2. Advance g2-g4-g5 expelling Black's knight on
R:l, a defender of the d5-sq uare.
[diagram]
3. Play �g5xR:l to eliminate the knight defending
the d5-square.
4. Play f2-f4-f5 preventing Black from placing
his light-squared bishop on e6. Black's plans 1 . Break in the centre with ...d6-d5 and, by doing so, take over the initiative.
2. Press down the c-file, so that White cannot
play ltJc3-d5 because of a vulnerable pawn on c2.
3. Play ... b7-b5-b4 expelling White's knight from
c3 before ltJc3-d5 can be played. Overall, I believe chances are approximately level. If things work out well for White, he will have pleasant control of the d5-sq uare and he will be able to progress slowly, either positionally on the d-file, or tactically with a kingside pawn storm. On the other hand, if Black's strategy succeeds he will be able either to release his position with ... d6-d5, or favourably transfer into a Najdorf structure ofType I. Variants of this structure Throughout this chapter we will consider two other versions of this pawn structure. The first consists of White having a pawn on c4 rather than c2. Roughly speaking, this permanently 1 56 Family Two - Open Sicilian prevents the ...d6-d5 break, but instead gives Black the possibility to attack with ... b7-b5. The second version of this pawn structure consists of White having his f-pawn on f5 instead of f3. The main difference is that such a pawn provides better chances for a kingside attack, although the e4-pawn becomes more vulnerable. This chapter is organized around these three variants of the structure. The first two games are examples of the standard structure with the pawns on c2 and f3. The first game illustrates White's control of the d5-square while the second is an initial example of Black's central break with ... d6-d5. The next two games showcase White's c4-pawn. In the first, White gains a dominating position from the start and easily imposes his advantage, while the second is a complicated game in which Black gains enduring counterplay by breaking White's central hold with ... b7-b5. The last two games illustrate the structure with White's pawn on f5. In the first White successfully prevents the ...d6-d5 break and slowly grinds Black down, while in the second Black does manage to break in the centre with ... d6-d5 and obtains a quick and easy win. Vladimir Akopian -Alexander Morozevich Bursa 201 0 Leaming objective: This game illustrates the typical fight between White's knight on d5 and Black's dark-squared bishop.

It is often said that if White controls the d5-square and Black's only minor piece is the dark-squared bishop, then White should be positionally winning. This statement strongly depends on how far away White's knight is located. For example, after 1 8. .B:d5 Black had two convincing ways to at least maintain equality since White's knight was on e l , very far away from the d5-square.

2. The ...d6-d5 break changes the structure into
a 3-3 vs. 4-2 pawn structure which is often balanced. Hence, from a structural perspective this break offers nothing special for Black What is important about this break is how well placed are Black's pieces immediately after it. In this case, Black's forces were ready to grab the initiative and gain the open file. lhis is what decided the game. Chapter 9 - NajdorfType II 1 63 Sergei Tiviakov -Viswanathan Anand Germany 201 2 Learning objectives: 1 . lhis game is an example of how White can gain a steady control of the d5-square after c2-c4 i s played.
2. White goes on to dominate the board,
and this game shows how to convert such an advantage into a full point.

We have reached the thematic position. In contrast to the previous games, the pawns on c4 and e4 automatically secure control of the d5-square for White. Hence Black should find very concrete coumerplay in order to avoid a passive position. 8_.h6?! This is a logical move; Black wants to develop his knight without having to worry about the positional threat of .Bg5xf6, but this is just too slow and this move has disappeared from top play.

Final remarks
1. The ...b7-b5 break was essential. It creates an
open file for counterplay. Later, playing ... a6-a5 was essential to prevent a q ueenside expansion, and to keep the b3-pawn vulnerable.
2. White did get full control of the d5-square
after all, but it did not matter much because his dark squares were too weak, which gave
3. Black enough counterplay.
The key to Black's success was his ideal piece arrangement. Black's bishop was quite useful on the g5-square, and the knight transfer ... !Lif8-e6-d4 was always a strong idea. Black had so many resources for counterplay that White's control of the d5-square made little impact and did not prevent the creation of multiple threats.
4. Overall, Black's play was a model for how to
conduct this type of position, and to prove that Black has sufficient resources for counterplay provided he opens some lines and keeps his pieces active. Zoltan Almasi - Jacob Aagaar d Istanbul Olympiad 201 2 Leaming objectives: I . This game is an illustration of White's many resources once the f4-f5 advance has been achieved. 2 . This game has two very marked phases, whkh couJd even be studied independently: A) Between the beginning of the middlegame and up to move 27, this example illustrates how powerful White's attacking chances are when associated with a g4-g5 break. This attack has a strong positional foundation, because White not only attacks on the kingside, but also gains a better control of d5, as Black's f6 knight is driven away. B) The second phase of the game starts from Black's 27th move, which is the transition to an endgame. The rest of the analysis is devoted to explaining White's winning plans and Black's best defensive resources. l.e4 cS 2.�a d6 3.d4 cxd4 4.�xd4 �f6

White reaches the thematic position under very favourable circumstances. His pieces are well organized and there exist both strategic and dynamic elements in his favour. The kingside attack based on h2-h4 followed by g4-g5 is much faster than Black's counterplay on the queenside. In addition, Black's pieces are not well prepared to fight for the control of the key d5-square, in particular note how ineffective the bishop is on d7. This gives White chances to fight for the win positionally, either in the middlegame or in an eventual endgame.

Having a pawFmil remarks n on f5 together with a firm control of the d5-square gives White superb attacking chances. The attack is enhanced by 2 having a bishop on the a2-g8 diagonal. White's play was strong, but careless through the first phase. He missed multiple near winning options in order to transfer the game into a superior, but possibly defensible,

The endgame was practically very difficult for Black. In fact, Black executed all the correct ideas, but lost due to a simple miscalculation with 50 ... i.b6. Without this mistake, Black could have held the game for much longer, and possibly even drawn after a long and precise defence. Again, it is not easy to deal with a weak d5-square, and Black could have

Black faced problems d ue to the weak d5-square throughout the game.

We reach the position of interest, and it is time for a comparison with the 1 4th move of the previous game: 1 . White's king is on the kingside. In the previous game the attack h2-h4 and g2-g4-g5 was strong and risk-free. Here, this attack is good too, but it could backfire against White's monarch.
2. Black's bishop on b7 is far more useful than
a bishop on d7, as in the previous game; it pressures the e4-pawn and controls the d5-square. 1 76 Family Two - Open Sicilian
3. White's bishop on f3 is less useful than in the
previous game; remember this bishop made it to b3, creating great attacking prospects. Overall, this position is approximately equal, with a slight tendency to favour Black, as the ...d6-d5 break is attainable.

White resigns, as Black's king is in no real danger. 0-1 Final remarks 1 . Black's pieces were ideally placed for the pawn structure, and this played a major role in the development of the game. In particular, the difference between Black's bishop on b7 and White's bishop on f3 made it easier for Black to conduct the game.
2. The idea of ...d6-d5 followed by ...e5-e4 is
typical, but it is only strong after White has already played f3-f4-f5. The reader should remember this theme and remember when it works. Chapter 10 The Hedgehog The hedgehog structure is characterized by Black's pawns on a6-b6-d6-e6, covering some central squares and preventing White's forces from approaching, like a real hedgehog does! Advancing several adjacent pawns to the 3rd rank would generally be a bad decision. For example, moving kingside pawns to h6-g6-f6-e6 would be a major positional mistake as it creates multiple weaknesses. Here this is not the case, as the natural arrangement of Black's pieces allows for the pawns to be defended rather easily, while keeping a variety of active plans at hand. White generally has a spatial advantage in the hedgehog, and Black's main plan is to break in the centre with ...d6-d5, or sometimes ...b6-b5. White will typically arrange his pieces to prevent such plans, while keeping the game tense and flexible. Now, let's discuss specific lines of action for each side. White's plans 1 . Break on the queenside with c4-c5.
2. Break on the queenside with b4-b5.
3. Break on the queenside with a4-a5.
4. Pressure the d6-pawn, but only after some
pieces have been traded.
[diagram]
Black's plans 1 . Break in the centre with ...d6-d5.
2. Break on the queenside with ... b6-b5.
3. Create a kingside attack with ... iih8, ... E:g8 and
... g7-g5-g4. Or maybe with ... h7-h5-h4-h3.
4. Prepare all the plans above without actually
executing any of them until the right opportunity comes. White's Plans 1 -3 are often based on arranging pieces actively to subsequently open up the queenside. Such action often gives White a big advantage because Black's pieces are not as active due to their limited space. The most common of these breaks is c4-c5, which typically opens the b- and c-files. White's fourth plan is not as easy to implement because the d6-pawn is not always vulnerable. Black will usually have a bishop on e7 {or c7) which easily protects this pawn from the attack of rooks down the d-file. In addition, the breaks ... b6-b5 and ... d6-d.5 are powerful, drawing attention away from this small vulnerability. However, after some pieces are traded, Black's chances of counterplay lose strength, giving more importance to a vulnerable d6-pawn. IfWhite's bishop is on the fl -a6 diagonal, Black's first plan is the most important. This plan is � strong that White players will devote a great deal of energy to fight against it. In most cases White Chapter 1 0 - The Hedgehog 179 will be able to prevent this break, and Black will need a new plan to create counterplay. A popular option is to create kingside threats with the third plan. This plan often yields double-edged positions where a single slip can be very costly for either side. As we will learn in this chapter, if White cannot fight this plan with a queenside reaction, then Black's kingside play will give him aIfn Wexcellent position. hite's bishop is on g2, then the ... d6-d5 break is much more difficult to carry out, but then Black's plan second plan (the ... b6-b5 break) gains strength. As long as White does not have a bishop on the fl -a6 diagonal, this break is likely to work well. Something to notice is that if White has played g2-g3 and �g2, then Black's plan of ... !l:g8 and ... it g7-g5-g4 does not really hit anything, hence should not be attempted at all. Finally, something to mention about Black's position is its flexibility. Often White will find ways to prevent or undermine Black's attempts for counterplay. In such cases, Black can often just wait and attempt new plans without damaging his position. In many cases it is better for Black to continue preparing his plans, or to start a new plan, than to execute a plan under unfavourable circumstances; this is the essence of the fourth plan. As the reader may have noticed from the discussion above, a key factor in the hedgehog is whether White's bishop is developed on g2 or stays on the fl-a6 diagonal. We will focus on the latter as I believe it resembles more closely the spirit of the hedgehog structure. The first four games in this chapter will illustrate White's four plans in numeric order. The fifth example will illustrate Black's ... d6-d5 break, while the remaining examples will illustrate what Black may do if this break is not possible. Games 6 and 7 are examples of the ... !l:g8 and ... g7-g5-g4 plan; the eighth game is an example of the ... b6-b5 break, while the last game is a fragment illustrating Black's fourth plan - the ability to wait for an opportunity without damaging his position. The position in this diagram is from the game Kasparov - Kramnik, Botvinnik Memorial 200 1 . We use this diagram as a starting point to discuss the key strategic elements in this position, from White's perspective: Piece arrangement 1 . White's rooks should be placed on the b- and c-files, ready for any queenside break.
2. The queen should be placed on cl protecting
the rook on b 1 from the potential X-ray attack by the queen on b8.
3. The bishop on g 1 is needed against the battery
... �b8 and ... �c7, attacking h2.
4. The knights on d4 and d3 (or a4) ideally
support White's centre. Possible breaks 1 . White can attempt to break on the queenside with a4-a5, b4-b5 or c4-c5. Any of these would prove effective given White's ideal piece arrangement.
2. Black does not have effective central breaks.
The break ...b6-b5 obviously loses a pawn, while the break ... d6-d5 is immediately punished by the typical exd5, followed by c4-c5 with a strong positional advantage. This response should be remembered, and will be discussed later in the chapter.

From the analysis of this position we learn about the destructive power of White's forces after the queenside has been opened. It is essential to observe how, after this break, White's rooks on bl and c2, and bishops on fl and g l , perform to the very best of their capacity. Chapter 1 0 - The Hedgehog 1 83 Mauricio Flores Rios - Hovik Hayrapetian Sant Marti 201 3 iLeaming objective: The b4-b5 break s ofre.n underestimated by many strong players due to its anti-positional appearance.

Chapter 1 0 - The Hedgehog 185 I wasa b c d e f g h already writing this chapter when this game took place, and I was happy to find an example of this powerful break in my own practice. Many players unconsciously disregard it in their calculations, as it has a rather anti positional appearance. Nevertheless, this is a perfect opportunity to execute this break as the b6- and d6-pawns will become vulnerable rather quickly. Black will have to give up material:

1-0 Final remarks 1 . The b4-b5 break should not be disregarded despite its anti-positional look. It is true that White gives up control of the c5-square and weakens his a3- and c4-pawns, but these factors did not make much of a difference in this game. On the other hand, the sudden weakness of the b6- and d6-pawns forced Black to give up a pawn.
2. After White had an extra pawn, it was still
a little difficult to impose his superiority, as the a3- and c4-pawns were disconnected. Nevertheless, the plan a3-a4-a5 should work well in most cases, especially if White has a dark-squared bishop applying pressure down the g l -a7 diagonal.
3. The variation 1 8 ... d5, in which White
replies with the thematic 19 .exd5 followed by 20.c5, should be carefully examined. This idea presents itself many times in hedgehog positions, and deserves a close study. Chapter 1 0 - The Hedgehog 1 87 Another Example of the b4-b5 break Although I managed to win the previous game by executing the b4-b5 break, I did not even consider it until conditions were far too favourable to ignore it. However, this break already deserves consideration in this position. Let's examine how the game could have continued after:

2 U�b2 ll'l d7 22.ll'lxc7 �xc7 23.1:1:dlt White

[diagram]
This type of position is a typical result of the b4-b5 break. Black has a knight on c5, but cannot make much use ofit. Meanwhile, White pressures the d6-pawn and has a free hand to attempt further threats. Black's position is seemingly solid but passive. A possible continuation is:
21.. .
.Bf6 22.gb4 h6 23.l!Jd4 l!Jd7 24.l!Ja4 .ids
25.l!Jc2
Black is under severe pressure, and is bound to commit a mistake sooner or later. 2s ...gc6?! A subtle imprecision. Probably better was 25 ... �a8 keeping an inferior but solid position, since the immediate 26.ll'lxb6 ll'lxb6 27 . .lixb6 .lixb6 28.B:xb6 .lixc4 does not offer much to White.

The rest of this game is irrelevant to our purposes, though White won the game convincingly. Final remarks 1 . White's early a2-a4-a5 break was very powerful, and Black should revise his poor opening sequence to avoid such an inferior position.
2. After White achieved the a4-a5 break, Black's
main problem was his lack of counterplay and the vulnerability of the a6- and d6-pawns.
3. White missed a major chance to win by not
attacking the d6-pawn directly on move 2 1 . The tactics were favourable and the game could have been decided quickly. The space disadvantage - and the trading of pieces Based on the previous examples, it should be clear that White's spatial advantage plays a significant role in hedgehog positions. Most strategy books teach that we should trade pieces when we have less space. Does this mean Black should trade pieces in the hedgehog? The natural reply would be "Yes" but reality is not as simple, and in many cases the answer is a forthright "No". The reason is that Black's chances of counterplay are mostly based on a ... d6-d5 break, which is unlikely to be helpful unless Black can create serious tactical threats. The trading of two, or even one minor piece, severely undermines the potential threat of a ... d6-d5 break. In other words, having traded some minor pieces would give White a more stable centre, hence a lasting positional advantage. 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 1 92 Family Two - Open Sicilian Pavel Eljanov- Dmitri Jakovenko FIDE World Cup, Tromse 201 3 Learning objectives: 1 . 1he position after the diagram is an example of White's advantage in the hedgehog once a couple of minor pieces have been traded.

The game has reached a relatively standard middlegame position. Black has advanced his h-pawn, which is often helpful to create kingside threats, and to support an attack along the a8-h 1 diagonal.

Chapter 1 0 - The Hedgehog 1 97 This move is often played to momentarily stop ... g5-g4. If Black wants to insist on ... g5-g4 then he will have to push ...h7-h5, further exposing his own king.

Black has achieved another dream hedgehog position and he imposed his advantage in 12 more moves: Black won. Final remarks 1 . Generally speaking, protecting the h2-pawn with �gl is somewhat healthier than protecting it with Wffgl. However, if White wishes to use the queen for this purpose, he certainly should not lose a tempo by playing Wff e l-f2-gl as in the game.
2. Important White should be ready to meet
... g7-g5 with a c4-c5 break.
3. Once again, after Black accomplishes the
...g5-g4 break, things do not look good for White in practically every variation.

2. Something to understand about this
position is that White's queenside plans are no longer a priority in this position, while a kingside attack is a much more suitable idea.

2. This game illustrates how Black's ...b6-b5
break weakens White's queenside and centre. John Bartholomew - Timur Gareev

Learning objectives: 1 . This game illustrates how Black can carry out a waiting strategy without damaging his position.
2. Black prepares many plans, and
speculates with tactical ideas, but does not carry out any of them.
3. Black requires great calculating ability
to carry out this strategy, as one slip can give White an overwhelming initiative, probably through a queenside attack. Both sides must constantly check the consequences of both White's and Black's breaks in this structure. l.e4 c5 2.'llB e6 3.d4 cxd4 4.'llxd4 'lid>

So far both sides follow the standard developing moves. Something to note is White's awkwardly placed knight on a3.

Black's strategy has been successful and his position is now preferable due to his strong knights on c5 and e5. The rest of the game is irrelevant to our purposes, though eventually Black won . Final remarks 1 . This game was a test of nerves for both players. Each player attempted to carry out their plans, but found a well-prepared opponent. If Black had played l 5 ... d5 or 23 ...g5, he would have reached an inferior position. In turn, White lost his patience and broke with 30.b5, which gave him a worse position.
2. This type of position requires great precision
in calculation from both sides, since they must constantly check how to prevent or meet their opponent's breaks. Chapter 1 1 The Maroczy The Maroczy structure we study in this chapter bears a great similarity with the Hedgehog from the previous chapter. In fact, some sources may call that chapter's structure Maroczy as well, simply because White has placed his pawns on c4 and e4. In this book, I decided to give a separate treatment to these two structures because I consider they are sufficiently different. The difference is in how Black develops his dark-squared bishop. In the Hedgehog chapter, Black's bishop was always developed on e7, hence ... e7-e6 had been played. Here instead we study rhose positions where Black fianchettoes his bishop on g7. Most importantly, Black's e-pawn often remains on e7. This fact has the following consequences: I . White can place a knight on d5, which can lead to a major structural transformation if Black trades the knight.
2. The central break ... d6-d5 is no longer a main
3. theme here.
Black can trade pieces without worrying about the d6-pawn becoming vulnerable, as happened in the game Eljanov - Jakovenko from the previous chapter. The structure we study in this chapter is typical of the Accelerated Dragon, but it can also arise as a transposition from the English Opening or some lines that start out as a King's Indian. It can also
[diagram]
occur with reversed colours if White plays the English Opening, allowing Black to reply ... d5 and later ... c5. Most examples in this chapter will come from the Accelerated Dragon because it is the most common source of Maroczy games. Nevertheless the ideas transfer easily to the other lines.-The main theme of the Maroczy is White's spatial advantage, which means Black will often attempt to trade pieces and later fight on in the endgame phase. White's plans 1 . Gain space with a queenside expansion, place a knight on d5, and/or expand on the kingside with f2-f4.
2. After f2-f4 has been played, place rooks on
the central files and break with either e4-e5 or f4-f5.
3. Place a knight on d5 and wait fo r Black to
capture on d5. Once this happens, White can transform the structure favourably with either exd5 or cxd5. Each of these replies is studied at the beginning of this chapter. Black's plans
21. Trade pieces to alleviate the space problem.

3. Break on the kingside with ... f7-f5 and later

4. Pressure White's queenside pawns with
... �b6-b4, and when White plays b2-b3, then ...a7-a5-a4xb3.
5. On rare occasions play ... e7-e6 and later
... d6-d5, though this plan is more typical of the Hedgehog. Out of the plans mentioned above, it should be said that White's first three plans are more or less equally common, while Black's first three plans are the most common for him. Black's fifth plan is almost never carried out in games which originate from the Accelerated Dragon variation. Symmetric Transformation When White places a knight on d5 and Black captures it, White's recapture changes the character of the game dramatically. The first four examples of this chapter discuss White's cxd5 recapture. The next two are examples of the recapture exd5. Then we have two examples of Black's ... f7-f5 break, one example of the ... b7-b5 break, and the chapter concludes with one example exploring White's f4-f5 and e4-e5 breaks. 8 7 6 5 4 3
[diagram]
lhis structure most typically occurs when we have a Maroczy structure and White places a knight on d5. Once Black captures this knight then White recaptures cxd5. We will call this the symmetric transformation of the Maroczy. The main theme in this structure is White's spatial advantage. As the reader will notice, there are no natural breaks in this position. Black could attempt to challenge White's centre with ... e7-e6 or ...f7-f5, but these breaks mostly weaken Black's camp and can eventually backfire. For this reason, it is easy for Black to run out of useful moves and fall into an inferior position where White expands to ultimately obtain a winning position. Now, let's discuss specific plans for each side. White's plans 1 . Control the c-file and use it for a seventh rank invasion if this is possible.
2. Avoid excessive exchanges in order to make use
of the spatial advantage.
3. Further expand on the queenside and kingside,
squeeze Black's forces and then find a decisive break. Black's plans 1 . Trade pieces to decrease the space problem.
2. Take possession of the open c-file, and if
possible invade the seventh rank with ... �c2.
3. If White has played b2-b3, then ...
a7-a5- a4xb3 can be useful to open another file for counter play.
4. If the position is already simplified, and White
threatens to gain space with flank expansions, then challenge White's centre with ...e7-e6 to create a distraction. This plan can backfire due to the weaknesses created, but they should not be too serious if the queens are already off the board. As the reader will notice, White's plans of action are far more dangerous than Black's, and this is all a consequence of White's spatial advantage. Black must be careful and understand this structure can lead to a passive position. Chapter 1 1 - The Maroczy 207 The first three examples are illustrations of White's first three plans all combined together to yield very convincing wins. In each of these three examples I will put forward suggestions to avoid losing passively in the way Black lost. Then, the fourth example is a fragment of a game to illustrate one of Black's thematic tricks to find counterplay. Lev Polugaevsky- Borislav Ivkov Belgrade 1 969 This game is a classical illustration of \Xlhite's ability to asphyxiate Black's forces after a symmetric transformation.

A simple approach. White has a stable advantage due to his space and pair of bishops. His plan is to expand everywhere on the board and to eventually asphyxiate Black. The lack of targets, or natural structural breaks, prevents Black from creating counterplay.

break the powerful d5-e4 chain with a timely ... e7-e6 break. lhis weakens the d6- and e6-pawns, but it is the lesser of two evils. Instead, by defending passively Black was signing his own death sentence. White's kingside expansion is a winning plan and passive defence is destined to fail no matter how precise.
4. White's expansion on the flanks was enabled
by his pair of bishops and his already existing spatial edge in the centre. By having more space, White is able to gain yet more.

2. Unlike previous examples, White did not have
a pair of bishops here, but still managed to make problems for Black
3. Black's position was defensible, say with
24 ... B:xc3 followed by ... e5. Nevertheless, almost every line required precision from Black, while White could play for a win risk-free.
4. Something to mention from the initial position
is Black's pawn on a4, which is the same colour as his bishop. If this pawn had been on a5 to begin with then Black would have had better chances to hold the game, at least in the bishop endgame.

Once the knight on d5 is captured, White can also recapture exd5 to obtain a very different kind of position, which we call the asymmetric transformation of the Maroczy. Unlike the symmetric transformation, the recapture exd5 is much more tactical and double-edged. White typically attempts a mating attack while Black will gain counterplay on the queenside. Black has a backward pawn on e7 which could become a target for White's rooks. However, Black can often neutralize this pressure by simply placing his dark-squared bishop on £6. White's plans 1 . Create a kingside attack with the break f2-f4-f5.
2. Pressure the e7-pawn by doubling rooks on
the e-file. This is only likely to work if Black cannot place a bishop on f6. Black's plans 1 . Attack White's c4-d5 chain with the break ...b7-b5xc4.
2 Open the a-file with ...a7-a5-a4xb3. If White
responds to ... a5-a4 with b3-b4, then the c4-d5 chain becomes weaker, and the break ... b7-b5 could be stronger.
3. Simplify the position to minimize White's
attacking chances. 2 1 6 Family Two - Open Sicilian White's kingside attack is very effective if Black cannot create the appropriate distraction with queenside play. For this reason, it is a must for Black to have at least one queenside break at hand. In contrast, if Black realizes he will not be able to find a queenside break, then he should probably avoid this structure altogether, or find a way to swap queens before an attack develops. If Black desires to press for a win, the best approach is to combine Plans 1 -3 (or 2-3), when trading queens is most important. Once Black has played ...b7-b5xc4, and White recaptures b3xc4, then the c4-pawn becomes a serious long term target. This weakness is often more serious than Black's e7-pawn which is easily defended by a bishop on f6 or a king on f8. The next example will show us the power of White's kingside accack once Black has missed the opportunity to achieve a queenside break. Then, we will see a short fragment to illustrate the ease of Black's play in an endgame, once the c4-pawn has been weakened. Nikolai Ninov -Dragoljub Velimirovic Learning objeBelgrade 2009 ctives: 1 . This game illustrates White's attacking chances after an asymmetric transformation.

White has a winning position and the rest is irrelevant to us. Black resigned on move 56. ... 1-0 Final remarks l . White's plan off3-f4 and the resulting position proved to be very promising, as both e4-e5 and f4-f5 were potentially strong breaks. White unfortunately missed two great opportunities to play a strong f4-f5 break.
2. Black's problem in this game was his lack of
precision in critical moments. It would have helped to play ... e7-e6 to prevent White's knight from coming to d5, where it created threats and especially allowed the f4-f5 break. Chapter 12 Asymmetric Benoni The asymmetric Benoni structure, usually called simply the Benoni, is a very tactical pawn structure that requires great precision from both sides. It typically arises from various Benoni openings, though it also appears in many variations of the Ruy Lopez. The main theme in this structure is the fight between pawn majorities. White has a pawn majority in the centre while Black has his majority on the queenside. The side that manages to push his majority will generally achieve a superior position, and all plans gravitate around this fact. White enjoys some spatial advantage, therefore trading pieces will often work against him. In fact, as pieces are traded, Black's position often becomes better. The reason is that Black has the potential for creating a remote passed pawn, which can be very strong in an endgame. In contrast, White's chances are at their best in a middlegame with many pieces still on the board, since the central majority often provides him with good chances for a mating attack. Now let's spell out specific plans for each side. White's plans 1 . Break in the centre with e4-e5, either to obtain an attack, or to create a central passed pawn.
2. Break with e4-e5 followed by f4-f5 in order to
obtain a kingside attack.
[diagram]
3. Break with f4-f5 followed by a kingside attack,
mainly down the f-file.
4. Prevent Black's queenside expansion by playing
b2-b4, blocking the advance ... b5-b4. Black's plans 1 . Advance the queenside majority with ...b7-b5, ... c5-c4, ... b5-b4, etc. Create a passed pawn if possible.
2. Pressure down the e-file, preventing White
from advancing his central majority.
3. Create kingside counterplay based on
... h7-h5-h4, mainly when White has placed a knight on g3.
4. Break White's centre with ...
f7-f5. This break can work wonderfully after White has played f3-f4, since the d5-pawn loses protection. As we will see later in this chapter, Black's light squared bishop is often the least helpful piece, as it does not contribute to the advance of the majority, and it is often blocked by the queenside pawns on a6-b5-c4. The first three games in this chapter illustrate White's Plans l , 2 and 3 respectively. Then we use a short fragment to discuss Black's piece arrangement, and at the same time present White's Plan 4. Then the last two examples display a combination of Black's Plans 1 and 4.

stronger if White had not traded his dark

aTrading pieces often decreases the power of potential e4-e5 break. For this reason Black had a great chance to equalize with the natural 17 ...�b6. It often helps Black to trade off

After the break was achieved, Black's position became very difficult and just one mistake was enough for it to collapse. Nevertheless, even with the best defence, White's attack was very promising.

The reader should remember the sequence e4- e5 followed by f4-f5 as an independent break, an alternative tool in the position. White gives up a pawn in order to open the b 1 -h7 diagonal for his bishop, and free the e4-square for his knights. At the same time the e5-square is unavailable to Black's knights, making the defence quite difficult.

2. White's attacking scheme with e4-e5 followed
by f4-f5 is often strong, but not always as effective as in this example. Black's problem here was having played ...h7-h5 (weakening g6) in addition to the white bishop's presence on the b 1 -h 7 diagonal, which added pressure to the g6-pawn. 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1

[diagram]
The position in the diagram occurred in the game Mikhalevski - Guseinov, Novi Sad 2009. Black's pieces are arranged ideally. The bishop on g7 has a long range of action supporting che queenside expansion. Meanwhile, Black's knights combine the tasks of preventing White's expansion and pressuring the e4-pawn. However, the reader may notice Black's coordination would be disrupted if he had a light-squared bishop. Where could this bishop go? As a general rule, we could say that Black's light squared bishop does not find a natural place in the asymmetric Benoni structure, and this position is an example of this rule. The game continued: ... b5 2 l.axb5 axb5 This is a critical moment for White; Black will soon play ... lllc5, ...b5-b4 and begin to create serious threats on the queenside and in the centre. Meanwhile White's central breaks are several moves away. Hence, the only reasonable continuation is:
22.b4!
If 22.�h2 preparing f2-f4 and e4-e5, then after 22 ... lllc5 (threatening ... b5-b4 and ... lllxe4)

After a series of forced moves we reach a seemingly calm position. White is a pawn down and it seems he might recover it by pressing down the d-file, but Black has an energetic response:

this game is 1 5. ..b6 followed by 17. ..�a6 and l 9 ... �c4, to obtain activity for the light squared bishop and ultimately trade this piece and only then push the queenside majority.

0-1 Final remarks 1 . The critical moment in the game was after the move 22 ... ltJf7, and White's biggest mistake was not to accept the challenge with 23.�4.
2. Once Black gained the initiative there was little
White could do to fight back. This is often the case in the Benoni structure; the position is difficult to hold once Black's queenside majority begins its march.
3. Black's ...
f7-f5 break is often well met by exf5 followed by a knight transfer to f4 (and possibly e6). If White does not take advantage of Black's vulnerable king, then he is likely to fall into a passive position, as in this game. Chapter 13 Symmetric Benoni The symmetric Benoni structure is one of my favourites, and it is one of the structures that motivated me to write this book. It often arises from Benoni variations in which White recaptures exd5 instead of cxd5, which yields the more typical Benoni position we studied in the previous chapter. Unlike the previous chapter in which Black had clear plans to gain counterplay, now Black faces a dilemma of what to do. Black can often develop his pieces to obtain what seems to be an equal position, but White usually retains a small spatial advantage. This advantage increases if White manages to expand on the kingside, restricting Black's pieces substantially. Black's play can be rather difficult, and great precision is required to avoid being asphyxiated. A main theme in this vatiation is whether Black manages to trade off some minor pieces to decrease his space problem. In addition, the control ofthe e4-squate is often an important factor to determine whether Black can equalize or not. Let's discuss specific plans: White's plans 1 . Expand on the kingside with f2-f4, g2-g4 and potentially create an attack.
2. Attack the vulnerable d6-pawn with a bishop
on the h2-b8 diagonal and a knight on e4.
3. Sometimes White will also play b2-b4, but
there is really not much to be gained on the
[diagram]
queenside. In fact, opening the queenside could give Black chances for much-needed counter play. Black's plans 1 . Control the e4-squate and occupy it with a knight.
2. Break on the queenside with ...
b7-b5, and obtain counterplay against a potentially weak d5-pawn.
3. Trade off minor pieces to decrease the space
problem. Sometimes this can be achieved with the sequence ... '.Rb6, .. ..Bf5 and ... ltie4 which can also create pressure against the b2-pawn. White's kingside expansion is the most important plan in the position, and Black's plans are aimed at fighting against it. After White plays f2-f4, Black should typically reply with ...f7-f5 to claim some space before it is too late. Later he should be ready to prevent g2-g4, as White could gain a decisive spatial advantage with this expansion. Black's Plan 2 is probably the most active and interesting reaction, and should be considered in a variety of positions even in the form of a pawn sacrifice. The virtue of this sacrifice is that it opens many lines, and may turn White's kingside expansion into a weakening. Chapter 13 - Symmetric Benoni 243 The first game in this chapter is an older example which illustrates White's Plan 1 being executed to perfection. Then, the second game is a more modern version where Black finds a better defensive plan, though still remaining passive. The third game illustrates White's Plan 2, while White's Plan 3 is not really covered simply because it is not as important or useful. Then, the last three games in the chapter illustrate Black's Plans 1 -3 in that order. Boris Spassky- Robert Fischer Sveti Stefan/Belgrade (26) 1 992 Leaming objective This game illustrates how White's kingside expansion can totally suffocate Black's forces.

2 I believe Black's biggest mistake was choosing to
play this type of structure under unfavourable conditions. In recent years, White has scored over 80% from the position after I O.\!N d I ; this should tdl us something.
3. Black's biggest problem was being unable to
prevent White's expansion with g2-g4. In an ideal case, Black would have had a knight on ffi and a bishop on c8 preventing such an advance.
4. After White's 18th move g4-g5, I cannot find
any good suggestions for Black. His position is bad, and his defensive task near impossible

As the reader may have noticed, the opening of the kingside often turned out to favour White. This is a characteristic inherited from the structure c4-d5 vs. c5-d6: this tiny spatial advantage makes allthe difference. Vladimir Malakhov - Alexander Grischuk Russian Championship, Moscow 2010 Learning objective: This game i s an example of how the symmetric Benoni structure is treated in modern practice.

White does not seem to know what he is doing. He has not developed a single piece while Black has already castled. However, he has obtained a symmetric Benoni structure, which often gives White a stable centre and a lasting spatial advantage.

I thought breaking on the queenside to undermine White's coordination was my only way to avoid being squeezed as in the previous examples. I believe I was right about this evaluation.

The key to 28 ... lllxd5 is that after 29.�xd5 8'.d3 Black regains the piece with a crushing attack.

If Black had not chosen 8 ...b5, he would have been left without active plans, and his development lead would have been worthless.
2. Black's ... b7-b5 pawn sacrifice was effective
because the d5-pawn immediately became a target and because White's king became vulnerable. Without these factors this sacrifice could have been a failure.
3. It is worth noticing how White never really
managed to organize his forces towards anything other than protecting his weaknesses. And everything Black achieved was at the sole cost of a pawn! This means the ... b7-b5 sacrifice is often well justified as long as Black can seize immediate coumerplay.

�xb2? As a King's Indian player I faced this pawn structure rather frequently, and I often got into trouble due to White's kingside expansion. Later, I learned this plan in order to capture the b2- pawn, but to my surprise even those positions posed some problems for Black, and this game is an example. Then the question is: Wkfi does this happen? The reason is that in most variations, the weakness of the d6- and b7-pawns is far more important than losing the b2-pawn, and the well-advanced d5-pawn turns the balance in White's favour in most cases.

Black cannot avoid losing the f5-pawn due to g3-g4. After losing this pawn the endgame is lost, therefore Black resigned. This game is yet another illustration of White's endgame potential in this structure. 1-0 Final remarks The main message to be remembered from this game is how Black's plan of capturing the b2- pawn can backfire as the b7- and d6-pawns become far more serious targets. Chapter 14 KID Type I This structure most commonly appears in the King's Indian, the Queen's Indian and the Ruy Lopez. In my own games I often encountered this structure with Black, and I lost many games without really understanding why. For this reason, when writing this book I considered this structure to be one of my main interests and I decided it deserves a separate chapter from other King's Indian positions, as the character of the g1ame is somewhat different. he difference between this structure and those in the following two chapters is the open c-file. This file plays a major role and Black's ability to stay in the game will depend on whether he knows what to do with it. The questions are: A) Should Black proceed with a kingside B) Sattack regardless of the open c-file? hould he fight for the control of this file? The problem with Strategy A is that White's forces may penetrate down the c-file, distracting Black from a kingside attack. For example, if White were to place a rook on the seventh rank, it would be difficult for Black's kingside play to continue making progress. The problem with Strategy B is that White's spatial advantage often guarantees control of the c-file in the long run. White has more space thanks to
[diagram]
his central chain e4-d5. If the position is not too simplified then this space translates into being able to manoeuvre more easily. In such cases, although Black may control the c-file at an early stage, it will be White who will ultimately profit from it, or from queenside play in general. This is not to say Black's queenside attempts are always doomed, but the reader should understand that Black's spatial disadvantage and White's lack of weaknesses will make it difficult for Black to gain an advantage from queenside play alone. Despite these difficulties, I believe approaches A and B are both valid given the right circumstances. Ideally, they could even be combined, though this is hard to accomplish in practice. Now, let's discuss specific plans for each side. White's plans 1 . If Black controls the c-file, the main task is to cover Black's entry points (especially c2), and then manoeuvre to fight for the control of this file.
2. If White possesses the c-file, then prepare
a seventh-rank invasion which is likely to capture the b7-pawn.
3. Expand on the queenside with a2-a4-a5 to
gain space, limit Black's mobility and create potentially strong passed pawns once Black's queenside pawns are captured. 8 7 6 5 4 1
262 Family Four - King's Indian
4. If Black plays ... b7-b5, then b reak with a2-
a4, and even the manoeuvre lllb4-c6 deserves consideration. Black's plans 1 . If entry points are available, or if White's c-file is vulnerable, then double rooks on the c-file, and possibly invade the seventh rank by placing a rook on c2. This is ideal, but hard to achieve.
2. Create kingside counterplay with ...f7-f5xe4
to open the f-file. lhis can be followed by .. �g7-f6-g5 to create kingside threats, and possibly ...h7-h5-h4-h3.
3. If White's play is particularly slow, then
... f7-f5, followed by .. .f5-f4 and ...g6-g5-g4 might work.
4. Transfer the dark-squared bishop from g7 to
b6 via f6-d8. The reader should pay close attention to Black's Plans 2 and 3. As stated above, White can easily create diversions on the c-file, preventing Black from focusing on the kingside. This means Black's kingside play should give priority to speed. For this reason, the typical plan ...f7-f5-f4 followed by ... g6-g5-g4 could be too slow, and Black's Plan 2 is more likely to yield results. Black's Plan 3 would only work well if White's queenside play was really slow. Examples 1 and 2 of this chapter will illustrate how White gains control of the queenside (and the c-file) despite Black's seemingly being in control at an earlier stage. Then, Example 3 illustrates White's excellent winning chances in the endgame. The reader should notice the similarity between this endgame and those endgames studied in Chapter 1 1 . After Example
3 a fragment of a game illustrates Black's dream
position in this structure, and later we see two more realistic examples of Black's play. The first of these showcases Black's kingside counterplay with ...f7-5 while the second illustrates Black's queenside opportunities once some pieces come off the board. We also see Black's Plan 4 put in practice to yield excellent results. Magnus Carlsen -Luke McShane London Classic 2009 Learning objective: This game is an example of Black's inability to create counterplay despite initially having control of the c-file.

We have reached the position of interest. The reader should examine this position very carefully and try to make an assessment of it. After analyzing this game, I would advise the reader to contrast his initial opinion and his final opinion. I imagine i t might be quite different. In his analysis of this game, McShane wonders if going into this position (with 2 1 ... lt'lxb5) was the right decision. His original evaluation indicated Chapter 14 - KID Type I 263 that he would have sufficient counterplay with his rooks on the c-file, but as he points out, there are no entry points. This is a phenomenon which I have observed far too many times in my own experience, and in those games I have analyzed. Black's position is reasonably good in appearance, but the truth is that it is very difficult to find counterplay, and although it is Black who is temporarily in control of the only open file, only White can really benefit from queenside play, as we will see in this game.
23.f3!�
A simple move that should be remembered. It provides extra support to the chain e4-d5, and it allows the bishop to come back to f2 in order to press against Black's queenside. As McShane points out, 23.a4? is a serious imprecision, since after 23 ... g5 24.Bg3 f5 White is forced to destroy his "glorious" e4-d5 chain with 25.exf5 (but not 25.f3? f4) 25 ... ltJxf5. Now the d5-pawn has been weakened, while the bishop on g3 is temporarily useless. A possible continuation is 26.l'kl l'hcl 27.\Wxcl l'k8

J�.ac8 24..Bd3 Something to note is how White can improve slowly, while Black can't The move 24.Bd3 clears e2 for the queen, prepares against ... f6-f5, and gives extra protection to the c2-square. Meanwhile, Black controls the c-file, but cannot do much with it. Lessaccurate is 24.Bf2 since Black immediately gains counterplay with 24 ...f5!.

Attempting to "use" the c-file with 24 .. J'k3 does not really go anywhere after 25.a4 when White can continue with his plans, ignoring the rook on c3 (but not 25.E:b3?! since trading pieces alleviates Black's space problems) and Black cannot insist with 25 ...

Black cannot defend without the help of his trapped rook, thus his position is lost. The rest of the game is interesting, but irrelevant to our chapter, so I give it without further comments. The reader may find some interesting annotations (by McShane) to the rest of this game in Chessbase Magazine. 1-0 Final remarks 1 . The option 2 l ...bxc5 deserves serious consideration and the reader should srudy it carefully in the next chapter.
2. Although Black controlled the c-file, he was
unable to we it. White was able to gradually gain control of the queenside thanks to his spatial ad vantage.
3. Since Black had nothing to gain on the
queenside, all attention should be directed co kingside play. The break ...f6-f5 was absolutely necessary, and unlike many other King's Indian positions, advancing ... f5-f4 was not always a good idea. In fact, on moves 26-29 it would have been a poor decision since this would slow down the creation of kingside threats, while White can create a strong queenside arrack very quickly. In general, White's queenside play can distract Black's forces rather easily once the c-file is open.

We have reached an interesting position. White has a notable advantage because of his gpaood control of the centre, and the backward c7- wn, but how shall he take advantage of these factors? The answer is the rather paradoxical but strong:
14.�xd6! cxd6
And the resulting position is the beginning of our study. We have reached the structure of this chapter, and this is the moment to assess che position. At first sight it might seem that Black is doing completely fine, as he may soon start to fight for the c-file with ... �d7 and ... E:ac8. Moreover, Black's dark-squared bishop (the bad bishop) has already been traded so he should have nothing to worry about. Unfortunately for Black, . reality is not so simple. The biggest pro�lem is that, as in the previous game, White has a significant space advantage due to the �vourable e4-d5 vs e5-d6 chain. Despite Blacks temporary activity, White will be able to re?rganize �is p!eces more efficiently and emerge wtth a dommattng position.

The reader should see a close similarity between this position and the games Polugaevsky lvkov and Smeets - Tiviakov from Chapter 1 1 , in which White inevitably gains control of the c-file due to his spatial advantage.

White's endgame prospects If White manages to expand on the queenside with a2-a4-a5 or something similar, then even after trading all major pieces and some minor pieces, he should have excellent winning chances due to his spatial edge. The following fragment is an example. � �WJ,0'�-''�'r

2 It would have been interesting for Whi te to
first press in the middlegame a little longer with 23.vti'd3, as I believe Black did not really have the resources to maintain control of the c-fiJe had White found the right continuation. How should Black play? White's previous three win swere very convincing, and the reader may wonder how Black is supposed to play. I want to answer this question by first showing a short fragment from the game Bouaziz - Beliavsky, Szirak 1 987.
[diagram]
After a Ruy Lopez opening, the game reached the position in the diagram, and now Black turned into the structure we are studying with: 17• .• cxd5 18.cxd5 And now:
18. ..�g6!
This is a good move for two reasons. Black will improve his least-useful piece by playing . . .i.e7-d8-b6 while the knight on g6 is ready to j ump to f4. Note how difficult it is for White to cover all the knight jumps when Black's knights are on f6 and g6; it seems like Black always has something useful to do. A different continuation, such as 1 8 . .. bxa4 l 9.bxa4 Eib8 20.vti' e2 a5 2 l .ltJe3 ltJg6 22.g3 gec8 23 .i.d2!, gives White a dominating position after i.d3 and ltJc4.

Black's dreams come true. Now he is able to undermine White's central pawn structure without having to lose control of the open file on the q ueenside. I should say White did not play well enough, and in practice Black will rarely be able to accomplish such an ideal position. Nevertheless, it is good for the reader to know what to hope for. Black had a significant advantage after:
27.ex.f5 llle7 28.lllh4 lll

30.°@dl Wlb7 31.g4 i.e8 32.lllg3 lllf4!+
The rest of the game is irrelevant to our purposes. Final remarks 1 . It should be noted that, unlike the previous three examples, Black transferred into this pawn structure under good conditions.
2. The conditions were good because there was
time for the plan ...�e7-d8-b6 to be executed, and because Black's knights were well placed on f6 and g6. In addition, White was not in time to claim queenside space with a2-a4-a5. Chapter 14 - KID Type I The following two games are more recent and much more realistic executions of Black's plans. Ruslan Ponomariov -Teimour Radjabov Medias 201 0 Learning objective: This game illustrates Black's chances for kingside play based on the ...f7-f5 break.

Dalibor Stojanovic-Ding Liren Istanbul Olympiad 2012 Leaming objectives: 1 . This game illustrates Black's effective queenside play once die position is somewhat simplified.
2. Later in the game we see the battle
between White's light-squared bishop and Black's dark-squared bishop, where Black executes the strong ... .Bf6-d8-b6 manoeuvre and manages to win convincingly. l.e4 c5 2.ftlf3 e6 3.d.4 cxd4 4.fi:lxd4 a6 5.J.d3 lllf6 6.O-O d6 7.c4 b6 8.lllc3 J.b7 9.�e2 g6 IO.J.c2 J.g7 1 1.gdl lllbd7 12.lllf3 �c7 13.J.£4 e5 14.J.g5 h6 15..Bxf6 fi:lxf6 16.J.a4t �e7

We have reached a very interesting position, corresponding to the Najdorf Type IL As the reader may recall, one of the key issues in that structure is the control of the d5-square, thus we know White must be doing okay at the very least. However, comparing this position with the game Tiviakov - Anand from that chapter, we see a crucial difference: White has the wrong bishop. Typically, the light-squared bishop can be very effective on b3 if the c-pawn is still on c2; as an example, take the game Almasi - Aagaard from that chapter. In the present case though, the light-squared bishop has few prospects as it Chapter 1 4 - KID Type 1 277 is blocked by the c4-pawn, which means Black is doing fine.

This is a very unfortunate positional decision; the kind of mistake I hope you will not make after reading this book. White chooses a very bad occasion to go into the structure studied in this chapter. Playing this position in the spirit of a Najdorf Type II yields only equality, for example: l 7.i.c2 ghc8 18.i.d3 �f8 1 9.il)d2 h5 20.il)fl i.h6 with level chances. But instead, White could have prepared il)d5, hoping to obtain this chapter's structure under favourable circumstances.

The reader should ask: what is the difference between this position and Wojtaszek - Swiercz? Black is not well prepared to pursue counterplay with ... f7-f5, but under these conditions he does not even have to. The main point is that there are only two minor pieces on the board, and in particular White is missing his typically strong dark-squared bishop. Black's pieces have sufficient space to manoeuvre, thus the position is roughly equal, or even slightly preferable for Black due to the awkward location of White's light-squared bishop. The alternative was l 9.i.c2 aiming to play i.d3 followed by a2-a4, and then l 9 ... i.c8! is a good option, relocating the bishop and keeping an eye on an eventual ... f7-f5. 20.i.d3 �b6 21 .a4 i.d7

I cannot overstate how much I like this move; the idea is to bring the dark-squared bishop into the game via d8-b6, which is similar to the game Polgar - Dominguez from Chapter 8. We have reached a very unpleasant position for White. This is one of those cases where the presence of opposite coloured bishops does not help the defending side.

This similarity only reinforces how similar pawn structures have similar plans and strategic elements.
2. White was unable to gradually increase his
queenside predominance (as often occurs in this structure) because two minor pieces were already off the board on move 1 8, and because his light-squared bishop was of little use.
3. Black's most essential move was 28 ...�.
bringing the bishop into the game via d8- b6. This thematic manoeuvre is something to remember, as the bishop became much stronger than White's bishop on c6. Chapter 15 KID Type II The structure studied i n this chapter often arises from King's Indian and Benoni variations. It is a common variant of the most typical King's Indian structure, which is studied in the next chapter, where Black has a pawn on c7 rather than c5. By having his pawn on c5, Black is able to slow down White's queenside play, giving Black chances for a checkmating attack in standard King's Indian style. Nevertheless, White has a significant spatial advantage and may attempt active play on both flanks, which is generally enough to guarantee a small advantage. Unlike other structures studied in this book, the tightly closed nature of this structure provides both sides with multiple ways to carry out their plans. There exist so many possibilities that analyzing a position thoroughly is a rather complex task, even with the help of an engine. In addition, many games will result in opposite fl ank attacks, which are difficult to evaluate as they combine many tactical and strategic elements. Finally, I believe most of today's engines are poorly prepared to evaluate these kinds of closed positions properly, as the engines are not fully capable of foreseeing the many positional sacrifices Black may make in an attack. As a general statement, I believe White is slightly better in most of these positions, but the resulting games are so flexible and complicated that Black
[diagram]
always stands a chance. On the plus side, this structure's complexity is ideal for those players who absolutely need to play for a win as Black. Now let's outline specific plans for each side. White's plans 1 . Create queenside tension with b2-b4, and later invade down the b-file.
2. Create central tension with the f2-f4 break,
and later obtain a kingside attack, or pressure against the potentially weak d6-pawn.
3. Block the kingside with g2-g4, and then
proceed with a queenside attack.
4. Trade light-squared bishops if possible, as it
often reduces the strength of Black's kingside attack.
5. If possible, respond to Black's ...
f7-f5 break with ltJg5-e6 and make use of this outpost. This is a good idea, though Black players will rarely allow it. Black's plans
1. Create a kingside attack by means of ...f7-f5-f4
and then ... g6-g5-g4.
2. Gain kingside activity with ...
f7-f5xe4 opening the f-file. This plan is faster than Plan 1 , but not as strong.
3. Advance ... h7-h5-h4, and possibly activate
the fianchettoed bishop through the h6-c 1 diagonal.
282 Family Four - King's Indian
4. Play on the queenside with ... b7-b5, though
this is far less likely as White is going to play b2-b4 and the resulting tension is usually favourable to White due to his spatial advantage. White's Plan 1 is probably the most common, while Black's Plan 4 is pretty rare, since White has more space on the queenside and is likely to dominate this side of the board. Choosing between Black's Plans 1 and 2 ( ... f5-f4 or .. .f5xe4) depends on how far advanced White is on the queenside. Similarly to the previous chapter, if White is already creating threats, then playing ... f5-f4 and attempting ... g6-g5-g4 will be far too slow to help. In contrast, if Black has managed to neutralize White's queenside play, then Black's Plan 1 is certainly the most ambitious and advisable continuation. Black will play ... f7-f5 in essentially every game in this structure, which means White will probably have an option to play exf5 (or in some cases be forced to make this capture). This capture on f5 modifies the structure significantly, and Black may recapture this pawn with the g-pawn or with a piece. The first two examples of this chapter will consider Black's recapture ... gxf5, while the third example will briefly explain what happens when Black recaptures on f5 with a piece. The following chapter will have four additional examples of these positions, with the only difference of having a pawn on c7 rather than c5, which does not modify the character of the game so much. After the third example the remainder of the chapter will be devoted to the study of White's plans. One example will examine White's queenside play with b2-b4, while the other will illustrate how White may carry out the f2-f4 central break successfully. White's Plan 3 (g2-g4) is worthy of attention, but will not be included in this chapter, as a similar version of it is studied in Chapter 1 6. Transformation A
[diagram]
Conceptually speaking, recapturing on f5 with a pawn seems to be the healthier option, keeping control of the e4-square and opening the g-file for the potential kingside attack which Black may develop. White will often advance his f-pawn to either f3 or f4, giving rise to different types of games. The following two games will exemplify each case. White wins in the first example by playing f2-f4, and loses in the second case when playing f2-f3, but this does not mean one reaction is correct while the other is erroneous. The reader should pay close attention to why a player may choose f2-f4 over f2-f3 and vice versa In addition, he should observe which manoeuvres give advantage to each side for each of these structures. Chapter 1 5 - KID Type II 283 Radoslaw Wojwzek -Alexei Fedorov Czech Republic 201 2 Learning objective: This game i s an example of'White's f2-f4 reaction against Black's recapture with ... gxf5.

Let's examine the position. Black has captured on f5 with his pawn in order to prevent White from installing a powerful knight on e4. This gives rise to a generally complex position. Black may attempt to: I . Weaken White's kingside with ...h 7-h5-h4.
2. Transfer his queen and rook to the h-file with
3. attacking chances.
Play ... e5-e4 in order to open the h8-al diagonal and gain potential outposts on d3 and f3. As previously mentioned, White will often choose between playing f2-f3 or f2-f4. In this case the choice is relatively simple since f2-f3 would block the bishop on g2. As the reader may note, White's pieces are not well arranged to pursue other plans, such as b2-b4, hence the game continued with:
15.h3 lllf6 16.f4

16. .. e4
This reaction is pretty much forced in most positions, and now we reach a critical moment in the game. White has only one good plan, which is: prepare the break g3-g4. Meanwhile Black must prevent this plan or he will face a formidable kingside attack. The following moves are rather thematic, but the order in which they are executed can make a dramatic difference, hence they deserve careful calculation. If 16 ... exf4 l 7.gxf4t White will make better use of the g-file, due to his spatial edge and Black's useless knight on a5.

1. White's biggest mistake was wasting time with
moves 1 7, 2 1 , 22 and 23, to then get his own queen stuck out of the game. The problem was White's lack of targets on the queenside.
2. After 26.exf5 gxf5 Black is essentially winning,
but not because of the structure. Black is winning because White cannot prevent the knight transfer ... ltJh5-f4, and because the queen is still completely sidelined on a4 .

When Black recaptures on f5 with a piece, the resulting structure gives a natural outpost for White on e4. In fact, White's main plan in this position will be to establish firm control of the e4-square, preferably by occupying it with a knight. With a white knight on e4, Black's d6- pawn will be weak, and later White can proceed with the b2-b4 break which will often allow him to secure a small advantage. Black is not without counterplay, and he may find many active continuations based on a kingside attack. Black's potential plans could be:
1. Place knights on f4 and specially d4, to create
2 tactical threats. Play ... g6-g5-g4 to pressure White's f-pawn (which will probably be on f3) and then open
3. lines for attack.
Fight for the control of the e4-square by placing a bishop on f5 and a knight on f6. It is very important for Black to maintain good control of his light squares. For this reason, he should try to avoid trading light-squared bishops, as White's control of the e4-square would be far easier and Black's kingside counterplay would be less likely to work. In this chapter we see one example to illustrate this point, though in the next chapter we will see another example of a similar structure (Renet - Giri), in which Black's attack is well executed. Sandro Mareco -Axel Bachmann Santos 2010 Learning objective: This game teaches us how White gains control of the game once light-squared bishops are traded. Note how passive Black's dark-squared bishop is. I.d4 lllf6 2.c4 g6 3.lllc3 i.g7 4.lllf3 d6 5.e4 O-O 6.Be2 llla6 7.O-O e5 8.gel c6 9.ifl i.g4

The kingside is blocked and White has not created any weaknesses which Black could exploit. White controls the e4-square and his bishop on e3 is far stronger than Black's trapped bishop on h6. Hence, White is positionally winning already. 23 •••Rd7 24.h.3 rus 25.@g2 ftJc7 26.ftJfg3 h4

it locks Black's bishop out of the game, and because Black's pieces are not well arranged to take advantage of the weak f4-square.

Black's opening choice aims to obtain a King's Indian type of position, without the need to know specific opening lines. This strategy is typically double-edged, as it avoids the opponent's opening preparation, but the resulting position could tum out to be inferior from the start.

Now Black has obtained a somewhat inferior version of the structure studied in this chapter. Black's problem is his knight on d 7, which blocks the light-squared bishop, hence the plan ... f7-f5 is momentarily 'banned' due to the annoying reply 4Jg5-e6. Worse is 8 ... cxd5 9.cxd5 O-O 1 0.�e3± when White obtains a favourable version of the structure studied in the previous chapter, since Black is not ready to fight for the c-file and his kingside counterplay has not started.

Final remarks 1 . Black's 1 O ...a6 weakened the b6-square permanently and this weakening proved important on many occasions throughout the game.
2. White took advantage of the b6-square when
playing 13.�b3, to threaten 14.bxc5 it)xc5 1 5.�b6.
3. Later, Black had to double rooks on the b-file
precisely because the b6-square was weak, otherwise there would have been no entry points and Black's rooks could have stayed on the a- and f-files doing their jobs.
4. White's most remarkable move was 32.g3,
bringing the light-squared bishop onto a powerful diagonal. This move however, only worked well because Black's forces were far from the kingside.
5. White's position after move 36 displays an ideal
arrangement of his forces, and in fact Black's position is already desperate despite having a closed position and equal material. The rest is a matter of technique, and the sample variation offered is just an illustration of White's many winning methods.

This position was first played in 1 96 1 , and for a couple of decades it was used by strong players, such as lvkov or Fedorov. Throughout the last decade, this position has essentially disappeared from master-level games, and today it is only rarely used by players with around a 2200 rating. During this chapter we have learned about the solidity of Black's position, and the reader might be tempted to think this is always the case, but here we have a clear counterexample. Unlike previous games, Black's bishop is located on e7 instead of the desirable g7, and White's pieces are well arranged for the break f2-f4. As it turns out, Black is simply not prepared to meet this break, and White already has a serious advantage if he proceeds correctly. n.Y!?d2 The most precise; this move and the next prepare the strong f2-f4 break. Another option was the direct l l .f4!? but after l l ...exf4 12.gxf4 f5 the position is rather c1o1m.••plex. <t>hs Black is playing schematically; this move clears the g8-square for the knight manoeuvre ... lllf6-g8 chasing away White's bishop.

2. White's advantage is due to his spatial
advantage, the vulnerable d6-pawn, and the e6-square. In this game White converted these factors into a beautiful win. Chapter 16 KID Type III This structure most commonly occurs in the King's Indian Defence, though it also arises from certain lines within the Bogo-Indian, such as: l.d4 it:)f6 2.c4 e6 3.g3 .lib4t 4 . .lid2 -We? 5.it:)f3 lllc6 6.it:)c3 hc3 7 . .lixc3 d6 8 . .\Bg2 e5 9.d5 it:)b8 Something to notice about this position is how Black has already got rid of his dark-squared bishop, which is sometimes trapped within the pawn chain, thus this approach for reaching the King's Indian Type III structure deserves consideration. Nevertheless, throughout this chapter we will showcase only examples in which Black possesses his dark-squared bishop, although many of the ideas transfer without much alteration to the case where Black does not have this bishop.
[diagram]
lhis structure typically yields play on opposite flanks in the style of a 'chain-battle'. White will hit near the base of Black's chain (the d6-pawn) with c4-c5, while Black will attack near the base of White's chain (the e4-pawn) with ... f7-f5. White's attack is founded on gaining material on the queenside, while Black's aim will be to create a mating attack against White's king, which will often castle short in this structure. White's plans 1 . Break on the queenside with c4-c5xd6 and later invade down the c-file.
2. Expand on the q ueenside with c4-c5-c6, and if
Black replies with ...b7-b6, then invade down the a-file after a2-a4-a5xb6.
3. First block the kingside with g2-g4, and only
then proceed with the above queenside plans.
4. If Black allows it, respond to ...
f7-f5 with it:)g5-e6; although similar to the previous chapter, Black is unlikely to allow White to do this under favourable conditions.
5. Trade light-squared bishops so as to reduce
Black's attacking potential. Black's plans l . Create a kingside attack with ... f7-f5-f4 and later ... g6-g5-g4-g3, or ... gxf3 attacking the 8-pawn, which becomes the new base of the chain.
298 Family Four - King's Indian
2. Obtain counterplay with ... f7-f5xe4 followed
by action down the f-file and/or attacking the
3. base of the chain (the e4-pawn).
In some cases, play ...h7-h5-h4 and even ... il.g7-h6 to make use of the otherwise trapped bishop on g 7.
4. Play ...c7-c6 to create central tension and
possibly transpose into a King's Indian Type I structure.
5. Play ...c7-c5 to slow down White's queenside
play and transpose into a King's Indian Type II structure. White's Plans 1 and 2 are by far the most common, while Black's Plan 1 is certainly the most common reply, although in many variations Black will choose any of the remaining four plans he has. Black's Plan 3 is particularly common in the Petrosian variation, and we will see an example of this. Similarly to the previous chapter, White always has the option to reply to ...f7-f5 with exf5, transforming the structure, when Black may either recapture on f5 with a piece or a pawn. These structure transformations are mentioned separately at the beginning of the chapter. The first four examples in this chapter are devoted to the structure transformation after White captures exf5. The first two are about Black's ... gxf5 reply while the remaining two consider the case when Black recaptures on f5 with a piece. Then we briefly discuss how pieces are typically arranged once Black has played ... f5-f4, after which we study one example of Black's Plan 1 . Note that Black's light-squared bishop plays a major role, both protecting light squares and helping in the attack. In fact, the subsequent example in this chapter (Azarov - Volke) shows how Black's attack loses its strength once the light-squared bishops are off the board. The remaining two games examine White's Plan 3. The first of these is a successful implementation, while the second is a great example of how Black should react. Essentially all the plans mentioned above are present in these examples, either within the game itself or within the analysis . 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 Transformation A
[diagram]
Similarly to the previous chapter, the recapture ... gxf5 seems healthier, keeping control of the e4-square and opening the g-file for a kingside attack. A disadvantage of this recapture is that Black's kingside could become vulnerable, as we will see in the next example. Also in similar style to the previous chapter, White will often advance his f-pawn to either £3 or f4, giving rise to different types of games. The games will develop similarly to those games from the previous chapter, namely Piorun - Hillarp Persson in which White played f2-f3, and Wojtaszek - Fedorov in which White played f2-f4. This time around White will get a good position from playing f2-f3 in the first example, and a bad position from playing f2-f4 in the second case - the exact opposite to the previous chapter. The reader should not attempt to draw general conclusions about whether f2-f3 or f2-f4 is always the best reply. Instead, he should observe how the arrangement of pieces and the circumstances of each game determine which continuation is best. Chapter 16 - KID Type III 299 Black's vulnerable kingside The following is an example of when White should play f2-8 against Black's ... gxf5 recapture. The reader should take the previous chapter's games as a reference when studying this game. I.d4 �f6 2.c4 g6 3.�c3 i.g7 4.e4 d6 5.i.d3 O-O 6.�ge2 �c6 7.O-O �h5 8.i.c2 e5 9.d5 !iJe7 10.a4 f5 11.exf5 gxf5 So far we have closely followed the theory, and now we are in the structure of interest. In contrast to the game Wojtaszek - Fedorov from the previous chapter, White's bishop is on c2, rather than g2. Hence, playing f2-f3 makes far more sense now.

If 12.f4 the bishop on c2 becomes blocked with 12 ...e4! 1 3.i.e3 it)f6 14.h3 c5!? when it is clear that White's kingside or queenside breaks are not easy to carry out.

xh5# Final remarks 1 . What the reader should remember from this example is the combination between White's bishops on c2 and e3, and the move f2-f3. If either bishop was missing, this set-up would be far less effective. For example, in the game Piorun - Hillarp Persson from the previous chapter, White's bishop was not on e3 therefore he could not prevent the knight transfer to f4.
2. White's g2-g4 break requires precise
calculation, but is not quite as uncommon as it might seem. It works well together with a bishop on c2. Salvijus Bercys - Mauricio Flores Rios Internet Chess Club 2009 Learning objectives: 1 . lhis game illustrates Black's plan ... h6-h5 followed by ... .Bh6 to activate the dark-squared bishop.

1. White's main problem in this posmon was
losing control of the g3-square. As we may recall from the game Wojtaszek- Fedorov from the previous chapter, White's kingside break g3-g4 was very strong, and not having such a
2. plan in this position is already disappointing.
Black's key move was 2 l...f0c5, bringing the knight into the game, heading towards g3, before closing the central structure with ...e5-e4.
3. White's imprecise play allowed Black to gain
crucial tempos on moves 26-30, helping Black achieve his dream position.
4. Once Black installed his knight on g3
and doubled rooks on the a-file, there was essentially nothing White could hope for, and the sample variation I chose to finish off this game illustrates that. 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 Transformation B
[diagram]
As in the previous chapter, when Black recaptures on f5 with a piece, White obtains an outpost on e4. White's main plan in this position will be to place a well-supported knight on e4 and later break on the queenside with c4-c5 securing an advantage. Black's counterplay will be based on kingside action; among his potential plans are the following: 1 . Place a knight on f4 (or maybe d4), to create tactical threats.
2. Play ...
g6-g5-g4 to pressure White's f-pawn (which is likely to be on f3) and then open lines for attack.
3. Fight for control of the e4-square by placing a
bishop on f5 and a knight on f6. Family Four - King's Indian As we learned in the previous chapter, in the example Mareco - Bachmann, White's position is much the more favourable if light-squared bishops are off the board, because it is easier to control the e4-square, and because Black's dark-squared bishop can turn into a terribly bad bishop, as it did in that game. In this chapter we will repeat this idea, which remains valid. White's knight controls e4

If Black had taken l 8 ... M5 instead of 1 8. .. gxf5 in the game Bercys - Flores Rios, we would have reached a King's Indian Type III-B structure in which White easily controls the e4- square after:

Black's g5- and h5-pawns are more liabilities than strengths. White's queenside play will proceed with c4-c5 gaining a big advantage.

Black's knight is out of play and White will soon carry out the desired c4-c5 break, while Black is unable to create serious kingside threats. Let's see what happens to an optimistic approach: Chapter 16 - KID Type III 305 Olivier Renet - Anish Giri Mulhouse 201 l Learning objective: By contrast with the previous game fragment, this game teaches us how Black may create kingside counterplay by fighting for the e4-square, expanding on the king side, and eventually achieving the ... g5-g4 break. l.d4 ltJf6 2.c4 g6 3.ltJc3 �g7 4.e4 d6 5.�e2 0--06.ltJf3 e5 7.O-O ltJc6 8.d5 ltJe7 9.ltJel ltJd7 10.ltJd3 fS l l.�d2 fxe4 A more popular alternative is l l ...lt'Bf6 which is examined in the last game of this chapter.

farWbe have reached the position of interest and so oth players have followed theory closely, but now White deviates with: 13Jkl This supports c4-c5 in order to gain queenside play. The position is typical, though not very deeply explored by theory, and it is a good moment to assess the situation. As we know, White desires to obtain firm control of the e4- square, and he will accomplish this after l 4.f3 and 15.lt'idf2. Hence, it makes sense for Black to begin fighting for the e4-square immediately. White was more likely to secure a tiny advantage after 13.f3 lt'Bf6 14.ltJdf2 ltJd4 1 5. .\1.d3 with good control of the e4-square. For example, 1 5. .. ltJh5 16.!i:el ltJf4 17 . .11. flt when White's kingside remains solid and he may proceed with l 8 . .\1.c3 to expel the knight from d4. 13 ... ltJf6!

This is a standard move, expanding on the kingside and clearing the h6-square for the bishop.

Attempting a queenside expansion with 2232 ..b3 �d7 23.a3 does not really help since after ..�e7 planning to double rooks on the f-file, White cannot play 24.b4?! due to the unpleasant: 24 ...axb4 25.axb4 �a4 26.�e2 �xc2 27.�xc2 lLid4+ 22 ...WlgS 23.gf3 .id? 24.b3 gf7 25.ge4?!

This move is bad for two reasons:
1. It permanently removes the possibility of
a2-a3, b3-b4 and c4-c5, which is White's only plan on the queenside.
2. It allows Black's strong reply 30 ...g5.
It was necessary to prevent ... g6-g5 for the moment with 30.i:l:d3, but after 30 ... :B:g7 the threat ... g6-g5-g4 gives White some difficulties.

2. Later, the control of the e4-square played
a significant role. As the reader may have noticed, White's position began to fall apart once his knight was forced out of e4, on move 32.
3. As we could observe in this game, Black should
have good fighting chances along the f-file as long as he can control the c4-c5 break with pawns on a5 and b6, as he did in the game.

Chapter 1 6 - KID Type III 309 Piece Arrangement -after Black plays ... f5-f4 Previously we have studied what happens when White responds to ... f7-5 by capturing exf5. Assuming White does not do so, then Black will probably push ...f5-f4, yielding the position we are about to study now. I would like to discuss how Black should arrange his pieces in one of the most typical situations where this structure will arise. The posmon in this diagram has arisen in nearly 3000 database games, and although it is clear White will play on the queenside and Black will play for a mating attack, it remains an open question how exactly these plans should be carried out. Let's consider the relatively classical approach:
13.�d3
Preparing the c4-c5 break. Nowadays many players prefer 1 3.Elcl �g6 1 4.c5!? �xc5 1 5.b4 �a6 1 6.�b5 with a complex position you will find in many opening books. Or l 3.g4!? giving rise to a type of position we will examine in the last two examples. And here is the piece arrangement I would like to discuss. Today's typical continuation for Black would be:
13. .. �£6
A far less popular plan is 1 3. . ..IH6!? to follow with .. J=�h6 and ...�e8-h5.
14.c5 �g6 15.!!cl !!f7
This is a key move! It will be followed by ... Bf8 and ... l 950's1"1g7. This idea was introduced in the early and is still used today. The point is to cover the c7-square from White's invasion cxd6 followed by �b5-c7. At the same time, Black's bishop protects the d6-pawn and the rook on g7 will support a kingside attack. And now after the continuation:
16.!!c2 JJ8 17.cxd6 cxd6 18.�d2 g4 19.!!fcl
g3!?
[diagram]
We see a pawn sacrifice that is typical and frequently used by King's Indian players. The point of this sacrifice is to open the f- and g-files, create kingside activity, and distract White's forces from their already-advanced queenside play. This sacrifice was first introduced in the game Taimanov - Najdorf from the Candidates of 1 953. That game continued:
20.hxg3 fxg3 21.hg3 �h5 22.i.h2 i.e7
Black had excellent compensation for the material, and went on to win the game very convincingly. The rest of this game can be found in the database, or in many classical King's Indian books. 8 7 6 5 4 3 2

It is known as the Mar de! Plata variation, and has a history that dates back to the 1 940's. Among its early developers were Najdorf, Gligoric, Petrosian and many others. Many of their ideas are still used in today's games. I will go through the opening phase without making too many comments for a simple reason: there exist very extensive treatments of this variation already, and any amount ofcomment here would be superficial.
9.�el �e8
The knight moves to e8 to cover the cl-square against a future threat consisting of !k 1 , cxd6 and lDb5-c7. An alternative is 9 ... fDd7 and after IO. .Be3 f5 1 l .f3 f4 12.�f2 g5 1 3.lDd3 we reach the position mentioned before this game, where we discussed one of Black's ideal piece set-ups. 10 . .Be3 f5 1 1.£3 f4 12 . .ifl h5 13.c5 g5 14.�cl A far more common alternative is: 14.a4!?
14. .. �g6 15.cxd6 cxd6 16.�b5
At this point we are essentially outside the opening book, and we can begin the analysis of the game. Previously 16.a4 �h6 17.lDd3 �d7 1 8.lDb5 a6 19.fDa3 had been played in the game Mchedlishvili - Rapport, Plovdiv 2012, but after 19 ... g4 Black has good counterplay. 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 ... a6 a b c d e g In some similar positions, Black just plays
16. ..l':1f7 and after l 7.lDxa7 �d7 the kingside
attack keeps on going, but this is not one of those cases, as after 1 8.a4 .Bh6 19.�b5! White can secure a stable advantage: 19. ..�g7 20.hd? �xd7 2 1 .lDb5 g4 22.@h 1 As we will see in the next game, the attack loses most of its energy once light-squared bishops are off the board. For example, 22 ...g3 23 . .Bb6 gxh2 24.@xh2± with a healthy extra pawn.

We have reached the critical moment in the game, and the utmost precision is required from both sides. I should emphasize that White's five move knight manoeuvre to c6 is actually far more common than it might seem; the knight is quite strong on ro, and disrupts Black's coordination. Ois n the other hand, White's queenside attack not as powerful anymore, since the only aggressive plan lies in a2-a4. In contrast, Black is ready to sacrifice a pawn next move with ...g4-g3. Should White worry? We will see in a moment. For now, I wouldsaywe have a relatively standard Mar de! Plata position, which in this case offers objectively beuer chances to White, but just one slip is enough for Black to seize the opportunity to execute a near-decisive kingside attack.
21.@hI?
This is where everything goes wrong for White. Although this is not exactly a mistake, it implies that white wm respond to 2 1 ... g3 with 22.ig 1 , which is just a bad plan as we will see. The right approach was: 21 .a4! This threatens the queenside before it is too late. 21 ... g3 Or 2 1 ...h4 22.fxg4 lllxe4 23.�± when Black has fighting chances in an inferior position. 22Bb6!

26.Bg4;!; Black's kingside attack is unlikely to
succeed. 22 ••• gdil 23.i.f2? White has been heading towards this position for the last three moves, and here we are. Is it a good position for White? Throughout the last decade I have heard innumerable respectable players explain to me, or others, how every time that Black plays the sacrifice ...g4-g3, White should simply react with igl and after ...gxh2 thenif2! would terminate Black's attack, because the h2-pawn would serve as a shield. I presume this piece of wisdom is mostly based on hearsay, so here I would like to put in writing how wrong, or at least misleading, this advice is. Black's attack simply moves on, and as the reader will see, there is no reason to believe White's position is safer because of the h2-pawn. Better was 23.Bxh2, though after 23 ...h4 24.a4 lllh5 25.Qgl lllg3 26.:gf2 h3! it is Black who plays for the advantage. For example, 27.axb5 axb5 28.Bxb5 hxg2 29.lllxg2 Bh3 when Black's kingside attack is far more promising than White's extra pawn. 23 • • • h4!i 8 3 1 3 1 2 Family Four - King's Indian
[diagram]
Preparing ... lllh5-g3. Maybe this is too early, but I would dare to say that White's position is near desperate already, as Black has taken the initiative and White no longer finds the time to carry out any aggressive queenside plans. In fact, after several hours of analysis, I could not find any decent continuation for White. For now I just call this position "slight advantage for Black" though I do not think White can prevent the position from becoming "big advantage for Black"!
24./Dd3
The attempt 24.a4 bxa4 25.�xa4 is too slow, and can be met by 25 ... lllh5!? 26.Qxh2 lllg3+ with a huge advantage due to the potential threat ... h4-h3. 24 ... /Dh5 25.@xh2 Thus White is forced to capture his "shield" h2-pawn after all. It becomes clear that White's manoeuvre i.gl -f2 was a mere waste of moves. It is too late to start with 25.a4 lllg3t 26.Qxh2 (or 26.i.xg3 fxg3-+ followed by ... h4-h3) 26 ... h3! (or 26 ... bxa4!?) 27.:Sgl lllh4+ and Black's attack is very powerful. ... /Dg3 26.ggl gf7 Preparing to transfer to the h-file.

Note that 28 ... :t':i:h?!? also gives excellent attacking chances to Black. A long but very instructive variation is: 29.illh3 (it is necessary to block ...h4-h3) 29 ... lllf8 30.a4 Searching for counterplay, but Black just keeps on going: 30 ...

White resigns as mate is unavoidable. 0-1 Final remarks
1. The biggest fact to remember from this game
is the ineffectiveness of White's moves 21-23 - that is, the plan of l!ihl and then ilf2-gl-f2 Although this is a typical response to Black's ...g6-g5-g4-g3 plan, it does not work as well as many believe.
2. Black's 23 ...h4! played a key role in this win, as
it is the best way to open lines on the kingside in order to checkmate White's king. The plan ... l0h5-g3 followed by ...h4-h3 is very strong and practically irresistible. Family Four - King's Indian Sergei Azarov - Karsten Vol.kc Dresden 2007 Learning objective: This game illustrates how difficult it is for Black to create serious kingside threats without his light squared bishop. l.e4 e5 2.lLJf3 lLJc6 3.i.bS lLJf6 4.d3 d6 5.O-O i.d7 6.gel g6 7 .d4 There is a nice concept behind this theoretical move. White will follow with d4-d5 obtaining the structure studied in this chapter under favourable circumstances. The reason is that White will be able to trade his bad bishop for Black's good bishop. As we will see in this game, this trade greatly reduces Black's chances for a mating attack. 7 ... i.g7 8.ds lDe7 9.i.xd7t lDxd7 1 o.i.e3 O-O Another option was 1 O ... h6 (preparing ... f7-f5) 1 1 .lDfd2 f5 1 2.f3 and now 1 2 ...

Another option was 1 5. .. a5 1 6.a3 lDg6 17.b4 b6 and now White needs a quick method for opening up the qucenside before Black gains kingside counterplay.

If Black is likely to lose the race, then he should not start it at all, and instead should attempt to find counter-chances by keeping the central tension. Hxa5 Chapter 16 - KID Type III 317 In this case, the way White's kingside structure is set up should be a red flag for Black. In previous examples Black's attack has proven effective due to the advance ... g6-g5-g4-g3, but what is Black supposed to do in this case?

2. Unlike previous examples, White's kingside
pawns on f2-g3-h2 are hard to attack, as there is no clear target. This fact made Black's attack ineffective, besides which Black was already far behind when this race began.
3. The reason White was winning after 22.h4
was that he had an enormous space advantage all over the board. As we will see in the next example, closing the kingside by itself does not guarantee an advantage if Black can secure some space on the queenside. Throughout this book I have been hesitant to include rapid games {let alone blindfold chess), as I prefer games played at the highest level. In this case, I thought it was worthwhile making an exception, as in the next game Carlsen's execution is simply superb and an ideal example for the position.

0-1 Final remarks 1 . Unlike the previous game, White played g2-g4 before Black had played ... f5-f4, which gave Black the opportunity to keep the pawn on f5, generating tension.
2. Black's key moves were 12 ... c6 and 13 ... b5!
creating central tension, bringing the bishop into the game via b7, and securing queenside space to avoid being asphyxiated as in the previous example.
3. Black essentially played this game to
perfection, and even if White had anticipated the strong piece sacrifice, Black would have had an excellent fighting position without any of the positional problems studied in the previous example. Chapter 17 Open KID This structure most typically comes from the King's Indian Defence when Black captures with ... e5xd4, though the same structure can be obtained in some lines of the Bogo-lndian, or the Philidor Defence as soon as White manages to play c2-c4 to increase his spatial advantage. In most of these positions Black will include the moves ...g7-g6 to fianchetto the bishop, and ... c7-c6 to prevent White from placing a knight on d5. White often enjoys a small advantage in this structure because of his space and because the d6-pawn can be a serious target either in the middlegame or in an eventual endgame. The opening and post-opening phase are crucial, as these moves often determine whether Black will obtain counterplay or not. If White manages to arrange his pieces ideally without first falling into some tactical problems, then he is likely to have a lasting advantage, forcing Black into a dull defensive task. So why do Black players accept this structure? There are two reasons: 1 . Ifone wishes to play the King's Indian Defence, it is unavoidable to play this structure once in a while.
2. These positions can lead to sharp tactical
complications which give Black realistic chances to play for the full point. High tactical precision is often required from both sides.
[diagram]
White's plans
1. Pressure along the d-file, attacking the
vulnerable d6-pawn.
2. Expand on the kingside with f2-f4, and
possibly g2-g4.
3. When the right time comes, break on the
kingside with either e4-e5 or f4-f5 .
4. Avoid an excessive trade of pieces in order to
make use of the spatial advantage.
5. If this is possible, expand on the queenside as
well with a2-a3 and b2-b4. Black's plans
1. Trade pieces to decrease the space problem.
Trading a couple of minor pieces is often good enough.
2. Place knights on e5 and c5 and then play
... �b6-b4 attacking the c4-pawn. If White replies b2-b3, then ... a7-a5-a4xb3 followed by ... �a3 is a good plan. The drawback of this plan is that Black's queen can be targeted.
3. Break in the centre with ...d6-d5 to unleash
his pieces.
4. Dispute White's control of the centre with the
break ... f7-f5, trading the f-pawn for White's e4-pawn.
5. Attack White's c4-pawn with ... a7-a6, ...c7-c6
and ... b7-b5, to reduce White's control of the centre. Family Four - King's Indian
6. Create a kingside attack; place a knight on f4,
and possibly play ... g6-g5, to control the f4- square, and to prevent White from expanding with f3-f4. For White the most important task is to keep his pieces well coordinated while refraining from trading pieces if possible. If this is achieved, then the d6-pawn will remain vulnerable while the kingside expansion will be easily achievable. For Black the most important task is to remain active and to be able to continuously create threats, or trade pieces, before White gains a stable advantage. Black's Plan 3, the ...d6-d5 break, is ideal but very hard to accomplish in practice. Black's remaining plans are all equally important and choosing among them requires good calculating ability more than anything else. As a King's Indian player I was often reluctant to play the plan with ... g6-g5 (Plan 6), because it seems to be a positional aberration. But i t turns out that this plan can actually be very effective if applied correctly, and we will see some examples in this chapter. The first game in this chapter is an example of White's ideal piece arrangement and the subsequent kingside expansion. The second example illustrates how Black's Plan 2 can backfire and his queen can become trapped. The third example briefly discusses Black's ... f7-f5 break, and then we move on to Black's ...g6-g5 plans with three examples. It might seem paradoxical that I say this structure is superior for White and then I include only rwo examples in which White wins. The reason for this decision was that the first example in this chapter is good enough to describe most of White's victories. In fact, White wins the first game in such a convincing manner that I spend the rest of the chapter providing ideas for Black players to fight against White's seemingly superior strategy. Georg Meier - Sebastien Feller Lubbock 201 1 Learning objectives: 1 . This game is an example of how White may pressure the d6-pawn to force Black's army into submission.

hh4 37.lLJxh4 1-0 Final remarks I . It is hard to find suggestions for Black to improve. While 2 L.�d7 was certainly inconvenient, the position was simply inferior regardless. Black's problems started early on when White managed to arrange his pieces ideally before Black could create any concrete counter play.
2. White's kingside attack runs smoothly because
of his ideal control of the centre, and because the weakness of the d6-pawn is constantly distracting Black from other offensive or defensive tasks. The following is a short example to illustrate how Black's queenside attempts may often fail or even backfire, proving the solidity of White's position.

21...hb3 22.axb3 dxc5+
The rest of the game bears no relevance to us, though Black exploited his advantage very easily. Final remarks 1 . White's biggest mistake was playing 16.Bb3, as this bishop was needed in the defence of the kingside.
2. Black's post-opening sequence (moves 1 1-
18) deserve to be praised. Note how Black keeps the threats coming, managing to trade one minor piece, prevent f2-f4 with 1 6. .. Be5, and then even create a kingside attack with 1 8. .. �h4.
3. From a static perspective (ignoring tactics or
the initiative) Black's ... g6-g5-g4 break does not look good. By trading his g-pawn for White's h-pawn Black weakens his structure significantly. The point here is that Black cannot afford to obtain a passive position and this plan is a great method for obtaining activity. If Black executes the ... g6-g5-g4 break well, then White will not have the time to take advantage of Black's structural weaknesses. The following game is an interesting example from my own experience. I had always had trouble with this structure and I spent the first few hours of the game just hoping to lose in an honourable way, yet somehow things worked out for me in the end. This game has many flaws, but I think we can learn much from the mistakes both players made.

0-1 Final remarks 1 . Black was unable to maintain the central tension and was eventually forced to play ... exd4 obtaining an open King's Indian. It would have been better to accept this pawn structure with 10 ...exd4 and begin searching for counterplay before White could consolidate his position.
2. White's biggest mistake was 20.a3, allowing the
a-file to be opened. From this point on, Black's play was a good modd of how Black may obtain counterplay.
3. 1he advance ...g6-g5 {as I chose on move 30) is
not quite as uncommon as one might expect for such a wild-looking move. We have already seen some examples earlier in the chapter. 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 Chapter 18 KID Complex lhis structure is most typically obtained from the King's Indian and the Old Indian Defences, though it can also appear in the Ruy Lopez. I decided to name this structure Kings Indian Complex to be consistent with the term introduced by Soltis in the l 970's. This structure is called a 'complex' because it is a highly flexible structure open to many possibilities. In fact, this structure could transpose to seven (!) structures we have previously discussed in this book, and here we still need to discuss some independent structural developments. Here follows the outline of possible structure transformations: 1 . White plays d4-d5, Black takes ... cxd5 and White replies exd5, we obtain a NajdorfType I (Chapter 8).
2. White plays d4-d.5, Black takes ...cxd5 and
White recaptures with a piece, we obtain a NajdorfType II (Chapter 9).
3. White plays d4-d5, Black takes ...cxd5 and
White replies cxd5, to obtain a King's Indian Type I (Chapter 14).
4. White plays d4-d5 and Black replies ... c6-c5,
then we obtain a King's Indian Type II (Chapter 1 5). 6 5 4 3 2
[diagram]
5. White plays d4-d5 while Black's pawn was still
on c7, then we obtain a King's Indian Type III (Chapter 1 6).
6. Black takes ... exd4, then we obtain an Open
King's Indian (Chapter 17) And in this chapter we will consider two additional possibilities:
7. White takes with dxe5 and Black replies
... dxe5. This chapter will mostly focus on ideas about this structure.
8. White breaks with c4-c5, blowing up the
centre. This break will probably give White a favourable version of a 4-2 vs. 3-3 structure, which was mentioned in Chapter 3. Despite the long list of structures and possibilities mentioned above, I believe the most common outcomes from a King's Indian complex are 4, 5 and 7, and since Cases 4 and 5 have been previously studied, four of the five games in this chapter will be devoted to studying the structure resulting from Case 7. The last game in the chapter will be an example of White's c4-c5 break. Chapter 1 8 - KID Complex 339 White takes dxe5 and Black replies ... dxe5 Black's plans lhis structure occurs when pawns are traded on e5 in a King's Indian complex; it is essentially the only structure with an independent value, i.e. a structure not discussed in previous chapters. Despite the apparent symmetry of the position there is a visible imbalance due to the placement of the c-pawns. White's c4-pawn is more advanced giving some spatial advantage, especially if the pawn is further advanced with c4-c5. In contrast, Black's c6-pawn covers the important d5-square, preventing White's knight from going there. The strategic battle is based on this fact. Black will direct his efforts toward controlling the d4-square, while White will attempt to gain space, obtain other advantages and prevent Black from making use of d4. The specific plans are: White's plans
1. Modify the structure with the c4-c5 advance.
Later, place a piece on the new outpost on d6.
2. Defend the d4-square, and prevent Black from
occupying it.
3. Expand on the queenside with a2-a3 and
b2-b4. Control the d-file and possibly invade on the seventh rank. 1 . Place a piece on the d4-square, preferably a knight.
2. Control the dark squares in general; trade
dark-squared bishops. Also, play ...a7-a5 and place a knight on c5.
3. Create kingside play with ...
f7-f5, especially as a distraction to White's queenside plans. White's Plan 1 is by far the most important and the beginning moves in this structure will rotate around it, as White wants to achieve it while Black desires to prevent it. If this advance can be permanently banned, then Black will generally be doing well. In contrast, if White manages to play c4-c5 then Black will need to reaa quickly, and Plan 3 ( ... f7-f5 with kingside play) is most likely to be the right approach. The first two examples in this chapter illustrate Black's dark-squared strategy - the control of the d4-square and the prevention of White's c4-c5 advance. Later, the third game showcases an easy victory for White after the c4-c5 advance is achieved. The fourth game in the chapter illustrates how Black responds to White's c4-c5 advance by creating kingside play with ... f7-f5. Although I usually prefer recent top games over older games, I could not resist the temptation to begin this chapter with one of Kasparov's classic games, against Danailov from 1 980. This game is a superb example of Black's dream strategy in this position. White certainly made some serious mistakes, but these mistakes are very illustrative and deserve study.
340 Family Four - King's Indian
Silvio Danailov - Garry Kasparov World U20 Championship, Dortmund 1 980 Learning objectives: 1 . This game is an illustration of Black's dream position after White captures with dxe5.

particularly the d4-square. l.c4 g6 2.llJf3 i.g7 3.�c3 d6 4.d4 llJf6 S.e4 O-O 6..Be2 eS Despite the fact that Black has not had the time to play ... c7-c6 yet, White begins to treat this position as a King's Indian Complex and decides to transform the structure with:
7.dxe5
Transferring into the previous chapter's structure with 7.O-O liJ c6 8.d5 liJe7 is far more common. 7 ... dxeS The central tension has been released and White's spatial advantage is practically nonexistent. Black's main goal is to gain control of the d4-square, while White will intend to play c4-c5 after Black plays ... c7-c6, in order to gain an outpost on d6.

This is really the point where the game becomes interesting. White's e4-pawn is q uite vulnerable, and there is little hope of ever achieving c4-c5 to create an outpost on d6. Thus, only Black has a clear target in this position (the d4-square) though the position is still level.

We have reached an important position. It might seem an exaggeration to call this position "clear advantage to Black" but this is not the case. White does have a very bad position already, for the following reasons:
1. Black has undisputed control of the dark
squares.
2. The d4-square is weak and will soon become a
target of Black's strategy.
3. White's bishop is useless on d3 and does not
have a better square to go to.
4. There are no weaknesses in Black's camp, hence
there is nothing useful White can aim for.

Many King's Indian players are afraid of this Exchange Variation because they worry that White can secure a draw with it. I hope this example gives some ideas about how to play for an advantage once White commits any inaccuracies.
2. It is extremely important to remember White's
positional mistake with l 4.il.xf6. This trade gives up the control of the dark squares, which Black then uses in an ideal fashion.
3. Black took advantage of his dark-square
dominance with great elegance and precision.

2. The biggest problem for White was 1 2.a3
hoping for the impossible b2-b4. White should calculate this in advance, and if b2-b4 cannot be achieved, then a2-a3 should not be played.
3. Black's posmon became clearly more
comfortable after ...a5-a4, as this move prevented White's queenside play and left the c4-pawn 'isolated' from the b-pawn and therefore vulnerable. 4 . Black's decision to open up the game with 24 . .. f5 proved very effective and it was a logical approach as White had given up the pair of bishops. This move allowed the game to be won very easily and convincingly.

Having started with the English Opening, this game has transposed into a King's Indian Complex structure. Once again, we have central tension and White can decide how to convert the position into a favourable King's Indian structure. His choice was:
19.dxe5!
An interesting alternative was 19.E:e 1 !? keeping the tension and preparing dxe5 on the next move, and now: 19 ... tt'Bd7 {but not 19 ... exd4? 20.e5! dxe5 21 .tt'Bxe5 winning on the spot due to the threats tt'Bxg6 and tt'Bxc6) 20.�a7 b5 2 l .dxe5 dxe5 22.�e3! White has a favourable position thanks to the possibility of a future c4-c5.
19. .. dxeS 20.Y!?c2 llid? 2I..te3 gcd8?
This is a serious positional blunder, as Black needed to play ... c6-c5 to hold the position. Now White will have a big advantage since c4-c5 is unpreventable. It was necessary to play 21 ...c5! preventing c4-c5, though White stands better after 22.b5 {or
22.:9'.fd 1 !? cxb4 23.:9'.xb4!) 22 ...axb5 23.cxb5!
followed by tt'Bd2-c4.
22.gbdl
The most precise. The slightly premature 22.c5?! is met by 22 ...f5 when Black is likely to gain counterplay, for example: 23.exf5 tt'Bxf5 24.:9'.fel tt'Bf6 25.M4 e4 26.�g5! E:de8 27.�xf6 �xf6 28.l'he4 l='lxe4
29.�xe4 tt'Bd4! And after a relatively forced
line we are heading for an endgame with good drawing chances. 22 ... llics Now that White's rook is on d 1 , the attempt 22 ...f5 no longer works after 23.�h3 �fl
24.E:d2! followed by E:fd 1 with strong pressure.
For example: 24 ... fxe4 25.�xe4 �x8 26.�xf3 l='lxf3 27.:9'.fdl tt'Bf5 28.�5 l='lxf5 29.:9'.xd7± With a far superior endgame.
23.llid2
Preparing the transfer tt'Bc4-d6. This was a good moment to play 23.c5± followed by tt'Bd2-c4-a5 (or tt'Bd6) attacking the b7-pawn. 23 .. J:UeS?! Not the best option; now Black's pieces will be locked up. Slightly better was 23 ... tt'Bd6 so that after 24.c5 tt'lb5 Black's knight is better than it was on c8, though after 25.tt'lc4 White preserves a big plus.
24.cS!±
White is nearly winning after this excellent transformation in the structure. This move

Black resigns as the b7-pawn and the game are lost. 1-0 Final remarks 1 . The advance c4-c5 can be extremely strong and Black must prepare something very concrete against it. In this game, probably the only option was 2 1 . .. c5 to prevent c4-c5 altogether. Other options to meet c4-c5 are to create a direct kingside attack, or to challenge White's c5-pawn with ...b7-b6. In this game the ... b7-b6 idea did not work well because Black's a-pawn was already on a6. So if White played c5xb6 then Black would have to recapture with a piece, leaving the c6-pawn isolated, as we saw in the note to 24 ...b5.
2. Once White achieved the c4-c5 advance a
crucial element in the victory was bringing in pieces with @h2-h4-�h3 and later simply trading off those pieces Black was using to keep his queenside protected. The weakness of the b7-pawn was enough to decide the game convincingly. Chapter 1 8 - KID Complex 347 Mikhail Ulibin - N ukhim Rashkovsky Russian Championship 2000 Learning objective: This game is an example of how Black obtains counterplay once White has achieved the c4-c5 advance. Here Black's idea is to play ... f7-f5 to create a double-edged position with attackfog chances on the kingside.

We have reached the first critical position in the game. How shall White proceed? As we learned in the previous game, it is crucial to keep control of the dark squares, and it would be ideal to achieve c4-c5 in order to gain an outpost on d6. My engine claims this position is a dear advantage for White, but after some analysis the solidity of Black's position becomes apparent. The game continued: 1 1.'efcl A worthy alternative was to play c4-c5 right away with l l.b4 fie? 1 2.c5 (or 1 2.a3!?) and now White enjoys a small advantage after: 1 2 ... lllh5 (no better is 12 ...b6?! due to 1 3.llla4! b5 1 4.lt'Bc3 a5 1 5 .a3 and now White has the additional idea of !;d 1 -d6 attacking the c6-pawn) 1 3.l!fd 1 lLl f4
14.Ml a5 1 5 .a3:!:
ll• •• \t>h7 12.ltJd2 ltJe8 13.b4 Now 1 3.c5 is a little too rushed, and can be met by 1 3 ... lt'Bc7 1 4.lt'Bc4 llle6 l 5.b4 llld4!? followed by ...b7-b6, when Black is just fine. 13 ••• ltJc7 14.ltJb3 ltJe6 15.�dli White enjoys a spatial advantage, but Black is not without counterplay after: 15-fie7 16.c5 £5! This reaction is necessary sooner or later, as Black needs to create a kingside attack in order to divert White's forces away from queenside play. After this break, Black's e5- and 5-pawns might become slightly vulnerable, but there is usually enough counterplay to compensate for this condition.

If 17 .exf5 gxf5 it is not dear where should White aim, for example 1 8.�c4 liJf6 19.f3 covering the g4-square, but now 19. .. e4!? yields a complicated position with mutual chances.
17. .. tlif6
The alternative 17. .. f4 18.�f2 g5 to carry out the typical kingside attack is double-edged, to say the least. The open d-file makes the attack much more difficult. For example, 1 9.:9:d6 h5 20.\1t/c2 liJf6 2 1 .b5!? and White's attack seems likely to arrive faster. An interesting alternative was 17 ... liJf4!? 1 8.�fl liJf6 19.liJd2 h5 followed by ...�h6 with good counter play.
18.�c2?!
Is White trying to 'play it safe'? This move allows Black to seize the initiative. If 1 8.exf5 gxf5 1 9.\1t/c2 Black obtains a perfectly playable position after 19 ... liJg5 or 19. .. liJc7!?.

Of course! This move is very important as it allows Black to bring his dark-squared bishop into the game with ... �h6, as well as play ...h5-h4-h3 creating threats against White's king. Note how White's queenside play has been stopped halfway and nothing has been achieved. The position is still close to equal, but Black's side is much easier to conduct.

2. White lost this game due to his lack ofprecision.
In general his plans were correct, but he missed some key opportunities to stay in control, such as 1 8.exf5 which could have secured a small advantage in a complex position. Ed. lturrizaga Bonelli - Kiprian Berbatov Pamplona 201 1 Learning objective: This game illustrates White's c4-c5 break against Black's centre.

10. .igS .Bf6?!
Black's decision to trade dark-squared bishops is premature, as the situation in the centre is not yet clear. The centre may transform into a variety of different positions, and Black's trade will only be beneficial in some of these. For example, based on the first game from this chapter we know White will not be interested in playing dxe5 after exchanging bishops, as the d4-square would become weak. A better alternative was 10. .. f6 1 1 ..\tcl tt'lh6 (or 1 1 ...5!?) l 2.d5 c5 when we have transposed to the structure studied in Chapter 1 5. Another common option is 1 o ... �b6!? l l .h3 exd4

[diagram]
This is a critical point in the game. Black will generally not benefit from taking with ... exd4, hence he must find a useful way to wait while White decides what he wants to do with the centre. The position is unpleasant for Black due to this uncertainty. 13 ...a6 A typical plan, intending to follow with ... b7-b5. Personally I find this plan very difficult to carry out, as White can often find a strong central reaction against it, as indeed happened in the game. Another option was 1 3. .. ttJb6 1 4.b3 �g4 finishing piece development, but after l 5.�e3 l"lad8 I 6.l'l:d2 (but not I 6.d5?! due to l 6 ... c5 when Black gains chances of counterplay on the kingside, while the trading of dark-squared bishops no longer seems to be a problem) 16 ...�xf3 17.�xf3 B:fe8 1 8.l'l:fd l ;l; and White preserves a small edge.
14.filel h5?
A consistent move, but wrong even so. If 14 ... exd4 l 5.ltJxd4± White has a highly favourable version of the previous chapter's structure. Black lacks his dark-squared bishop, which means his king is vulnerable and the d6- pawn is particularly weak. It was better to hold the position with 14. .. l'l:e8 though White is better because he has more freedom regarding how to transform the position.
15.c5!±
Did Black expect this break? Possibly not. I must warn the reader that this idea is quite typical and Black should always carefully consider the consequences of this break. White will generally carry it out when his pieces are better prepared for the opening of the position, as occurs in the game. Black's problems are accentuated because of his lack of a dark-squared bishop.

Final remarks 1 . Black's decision to trade dark-squared bishops was ill-conceived because the situation in the centre was not yet well determined.
2. White's c4-c5 break was an excellent decision,
undermining Black's centre and opening lines of attack for the bishop on g2. If instead White had played d4-d5, then Black could have closed the centre with ... c6-c5 in which case the trading of dark-squared bishops would have been justified.
3. The strength of the c4-c5 break is enhanced
if Black has already played ...b7-b5 as the c6- pawn becomes vulnerable. Nevertheless, the c4-c5 break can work well even if Black has not played ... b7-b5. Chapter 19 French Type I This structure often arises from the French and Caro-Kann defences, after Black challenges White's pawn chain with the typical ... f7-f6 break. The most important theme in this position is the control of Ihe e5-square. If White is able to gain firm control of this square his position will generally be superior. For this reason Black must find counterplay rather quickly in order to avoid being dominated. Black's counterplay will usually be based on attacking White's d4-pawn. For this reason Black will typically play ... c5xd4 rather than ... c5-c4, which would release the tension on the d4-pawn, and thus allow White to have a solid centre. Specific plans are as follows. 1 . Control the e5White's plans -square and use it as an outpost for a knight, although a rook or bishop would also be powerful on this square.
2. Pressure the backward e6-pawn by doubling
3. rooks on the e-file.
If White has already gained control of e5, then expand on the kingside, possibly with f2-f4 or h2-h4-h5 in order to create an attack. Black's plans All Black's plans are essentially based on preventing White from controlling the e5- square; they are:
[diagram]
1 . Pressure the d4-pawn, play ... c7-c5xd4, ... llic6 and sometimes ...�b6.
2. Bring the light-squared bishop into the
game with ... �d7-e8-h5 {or g6). Since White typically has a knight on f3, a bishop on h5 would produce an unpleasant pin {against White's queen on d l ) while also undermining the d4-pawn.
3. Double rooks on the f-file and possibly follow
up with the exchange sacrifice ... Ei:xf3 capturing White's knight, undermining White's centre and kingside.
4. Achieve the central break ... e6-e5, to obtain an
isolated and passed d-pawn. As the reader may notice, this position is fairly one-dimensional. Everything revolves around the e5-square, and I believe the key for both sides is to know when it is a good idea to go into this position, and when it is not. The first game in this chapter will illustrate White's domination once he achieves control of the e5-square. Essentially all of his plans will be combined to yield a very convincing victory. The second example illustrates Black's exchange sacrifice with ... Ei:xf3 and the third example showcases Black's Plan 4 and the resulting position in which the isolated d-pawn is both a potential weakness and a potential threat because it is also a passed pawn.
354 Family Five - French
This chapter is relatively short because the ideas presented in this structure are rather simple. In addition, the reason I only include one victory for White is because most of White's victories follow exactly the same path. I found many good examples, but they all communicate the same ideas over and over. What the reader must understand is: once White controls the e5-square he will have an excellent position and most of the plans listed above will be possible and strong.

Final remarks 1 . Black's biggest mistake was 1 1 . .. f6 creating a weak e5-square he would not be able to guard 2 later. White's plans as exhibited in this game are extremely typical of this structure; they repeat themselves over and over.
3. White's break h 4-h5 was essential in the victory
as it forced the creation of a new weakness - the g6-pawn.
4. In retrospect, we realize that having a pawn
on g6 should have been a red flag for Black, indicating his position would be bad after l 1 ...f6. Had the pawn been on g7 it would have been harder for White to break on the kingside {e.g. h4-h5 would not hit anything yet).

1. Throughout the entire game, White was
unable to install a furn blockade against Black's d5-pawn. In fact, this isolated pawn was never vulnerable.
2. Trading pieces did not favour White; in fact
towards the end, the trade of rooks allowed Black to obtain a winning endgame as the d-pawn advanced decisively. Chapter 20 French Type II This structure primarily arises from the French Defence, especially from versions of the line l .e4 e6 2.d4 d5 3.l0c3 i0f6 4.e5 i0fd7 5.f4 c5 6.i0f3 l0c6 7.Be3 cxd4 8.l0xd4. Another common way to obtain this structure is from a typical Sicilian Scheveningen structure (mentioned in Chapter 22), in which Black manages to get in the ...d6-d5 break and White replies with e4-e5. This position is a mirror image of the King's Indian Type III-B studied in Chapter 16, but the character of the game is not quite the same because of the position of the kings (which typically castle short). In this structure White has chances for a mating attack, which he did not have in the structure mentioned above. Despite this difference, other ideas remain the same. For example, White desires to have firm control of d4 and to place a knight on this square (like the e4-square from Chapter 1 6) . Also, the chain reaction f4-f5 (by analogy with c4-c5 in the structure in Chapter 1 6) is still strong. The plans for this structure are: White's plans 1 . Control the d4-square, place a knight on d4 and support it with c2-c3, a bishop on e3 and possibly a rook on d 1 .
2. Attack the base of Black's chain with f4-f5xe6
to later target the e6-pawn.
3. Obtain a kingside attack with f4-f5-f6 together
[diagram]
with bringing pieces to the kingside such as �h5, i::l f3-h3, Bd3.
4. Castle long and then pursue a kingside pawn
storm with h2-h4-h5, g2-g4-g5, etc. Black's plans 1 . Undermine White's pawn chain with the central break ...f7-f6. This is generally an effective way to draw attention away from White's kingside attack.
2. Undermine White's e5-pawn with ...
g7-g5, even as a pawn sacrifice.
3. Simplify the position to decrease the influence
of White's spatial advantage and the power of White's attack.
4. Trade the bad bishop (the light-squared
bishop) or find a way to place it outside the pawn chain, preferably on the b l -h7 diagonal.
5. Pursue a queenside minority attack with
... b7-b5-b4. This plan can be a positional idea to create weaknesses when White castles short, or can be used as an attacking plan if White has castled long. The first game in this chapter is an example of White's kingside attack, while the second illustrates how Black can neutralize this action with his Plan 1 (the ...f7-f6 break). The third example illustrates how bad it can be to have a bad bishop (with reversed colours), while the Chapter 20 - French Type II fourth example showcases Black's strong light squared bishop on g6, combined with Plan 4. The fifth game in this chapter is an example of opposite-flank attacks once White castles long. This chapter finishes with two short examples. The first of these illustrates Black's Plans 2 and 3 combined, while the last example shows how Black may trade light-squared bishops. As the reader may notice, whether White castles short or long has an important effect on the nature of the game. Both options are very common, but six out of my seven examples have White castling short for pedagogical reasons. The positions resulting from long castling tend to be very sharp, and tactical complications often dominate over strategic ideas. It is good to know these games with long castling, but one is unlikely to learn strategy from them. For this reason I thought one example should satisfy the curiosity of the readers while giving me the opportunity to show at least some tactical ideas in this position.

This is a good moment to assess the position. White is better for the following reasons: 1 . He has undisputed control of the d4-sq uare.
2. Black's bad bishop is completely locked in by
his pawns.
3. White may create a kingside attack, while
Black cannot advance on the queenside.
4. The pressure on e6 prevents Black from one of

Although White's move 1 3.b4 seems like a positional mistake {it creates a weak c4-square, and turns c2 into a backward pawn) this move i s thematic in this position and it works well to cover the c5-square and fix Black's queenside structure. This prevents Black from playing . .. b5-b4 and ... a6-a5, thus keeping Black's bishop on b7 locked out of the game.
2. Black's biggest mistake was 1 6
... 'i:Bxe3 which allowed White some extra support for his e5- pawn, to later push f4-f5 optimally.
3. The reader should remember Black's reaction

4. Once White achieves the f4-f5 break under
optimal conditions, there is essentially nothing Black can do to prevent a deadly mating attack. A reason for White's success in this game was his control of the d4-square and Black's inability to use his bishop on b 7. In practical terms, White had an extra piece for the attack, and thus i t comes as no surprise that his attack was a success. 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1

2. From this example the reader should learn to
treat the bad bishop as a serious problem, and find the first opportunity to trade it or make use of it. In this game, White was probably too careless to realize that 22.�a3 could secure equality, while 22 ...\t d2 would lock the bishop

From Black's play, the pawn sacrifice 36 ... h4 followed by 40 ... g5 was simply superb, as White cannot survive once the position becomes open. Sebastien Maze - Ni Hua Biel 20 1 1 Learning objective In this game we see how strong Black's bad bishop can be when it is outside the pawn chain.

Much better was:

Black's queenside play has resulted in a weak c3-pawn and undisputed control of the b-file (the b I-square is covered by the bishop!).

1. The face thac Black's bishop was on the h7-b 1
diagonal played a key role throughout che game. lhe main ching to notice is how White could not carry ouc his standard f4-f5 break because chis bishop was ideally placed to prevent ic. Instead he had to seccle for che far less effective h2-h4-h5 plan which ulcimacely backfired.
2. Black's queenside counterplay with ...b5-b4
was also a significant obstacle to White's accack, forcing him to hurry up in his kingside actions. Black probably should have kepc an eye on che possible 27.c4! and in retrospect ic could have been beccer to play 22 ... b4 opening the
3. queenside at once.
If we observe the later stages of the game, we seehow Black's supposedly bad bishop actually combines accack and defence in an excellent fashion. In contrast, White's bad bishop on f2 really is a bad piece and contributes nothing to the baccle.

i!bS? This natural-looking move is actually a near decisive mistake for Black. I presume he was not familiar with the attacking scheme White intended to use.

Black's attack arrives first, for example 20.g5 E:fc8 2 l .h5 0Bxb2! with a crushing attack. But I believe that after the strong 17. 0Ba4! the complications favour White, since there is no time to go after the knight on a4. For example,

Final remarks 1 . Once White castles long, the game becomes very complex and requires precise calculation. Black's biggest mistake was not trading pieces with 1 6. .. tt:'Bc5, though much calculation was needed to realize this.
2. White's attacking scheme - �xh7 followed
by g5-g6 and h5-h6 - has an effectiveness of pretty much 1 00%. Black should avoid it at all costs by running faster on the queenside or trading pieces with ... tt:'Bc5 before it is too late. Trading pieces and the ... g7-g5 break One of Black's common strategies in this structure is to head directly for a solid endgame either to secure a draw or to outplay White in a long game.

Nevertheless, Black has a solid position with many resources, and even the slightest slip from White will conven the game into full equality.

Now Black has gained an open g-file while White has to deal with the vulnerable f4- and h2-pawns. The game is approximately balanced though Black's side is slightly easier to conduct, and indeed Black eventually won the game. How Black trades his light-squared bishop A recurring question in this structure is how Black should make use of his light-squared bishop. In the earlier example Van Wely - Karjakin, we saw how useless this bad bishop can be, while the game Maze - Ni Hua was an example of this bishop's potential outside the pawn chain. The latter example came from a line of the Caro-Kann Defence in which Black automatically gets his bishop outside the chain on move 3. Since Black does not achieve this in the French Defence, what should he make of this bishop? In many cases the best approach is to trade it with the typical ...b7-b6 and ...�a6. Here is an example: l.e4 e6 2.d4 d5 3.�c3 �f6 4.e5 �fd7 5.£4 c5
6.�0 �c6 7..Be3 J.e7 8.�d2 O-O 9..Be2 b6
10.�dl a5 l l.O-O b6
Although this exact position has occurred in only a few games on my database, Black's idea of ...b7-b6, ... a7-a5 and ...�a6 is extremely common and works well. Now the game Brkic Kovacevic, Croatia 20 10, continued:
12.ha6 fu:a6 13.a4
If l 3.c3 b5 l 4.dxc5 hc5 Black is ready for the ...b5-b4 break while White lacks the power for a kingside attack. 13 ... l!.aS 14.�d cxd4 15.�xd4 �d4

Black has reached the structure of this chapter under good conditions. White is unlikely to succeed with a kingside attack as he lacks his light-squared bishop. Meanwhile Black is ready to play on the c-file.

19.g4?
This kingside attack is ill-conceived; White does not have the right pieces to create an attack. Things would be different if he had a light squared bishop on, for example, c2. White is already worse after 1 9 .i.xc5 bxc5

8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 a c d e f g h The kingside is safely closed and Black is winning as the c3-pawn is dropping; the rest of the game is irrelevant to our purposes, though Black won easily. The analysis of this example is deliberately short as the message does not require much explanation. Black was able to obtain an excellent version of this structure by first trading light squared bishops. Then the moves ...�e7-b4xc3 simplified the position to obtain a fight between Black's strong knight and White's bad bishop. White should have realized his kingside attack was unlikely to work, especially since his dark squared bishop was incapable of contributing. The reader should remember how Black can trade his light-squared bishop (with ... �a6) and how poor White's attack is without the right minor pieces - for example, without his light squared bishop, or without a sufficient number of pieces. b Chapter 21 French Type III This structure will most typically arise from the Advance Variations of the French or the Caro Kann but it can also be obtained from other openings, such as the Catalan after l .d4 lt:Bf6

There is a strong similarity between the French Type III structure and the King's Indian Type III, which we studied in Chapter 1 6, which is a mirror version of this structure. Both in that structure and this one, there will be a fight on opposite flanks based on chain operations. White will want to hit near the base of Black's chain, the e6-pawn, with f2-f4-f5, while Black will try the same with ... cl-c5. Similarly to the analogy we made in the previous chapter, there is one major difference between this structure and Chapter 1 6, and it is the location of the kings. In Chapter 16, Black was likely to play ... f7-f5-f4 gaining kingside space and therefore having chances for an attack. In contrast, it is White who has attacking chances in this structure because of his e5-pawn. Most likely Black will castle short, though we will also consider the case where Black decides to castle long. Since this is a closed position, the colour of the bishops will play a significant role. Following the general rule, White's dark-squared bishop and Black's light-squared bishop will be considered 'bad'. But in practice, White's spatial advantage allows him to make good use of his dark-squared bishop. Even from cl this bishop can prove helpful in a kingside attack. In contrast, if Black's bishop is on its initial square c8, it is likely to be a terrible piece, which is similar to what we learned in the game Van Wely - Karjakin from the previous chapter (with reversed colours). On the other hand, if the black bishop is on f5 or g6, then it's a different story. Now, let's discuss specific plans. White's plans 1 . Attack the base of Black's pawn chain with f2-f4-f5-fxe6.
2. Create a powerful kingside attack with
f2-f4-f5-f6 followed by mate threats on the gl-square. 8

3. Attack Black's kingside with rooks along the
third rank, a bishop on the b 1 -h7 diagonal, and a queen typically placed on h5. A piece sacrifice on the kingside is also likely to work well. Black's plans 1 . Attack the base of the chain, White's d4-pawn, with ... c7-c5xd4, ... tec6 , ... 1&b6. In some cases use major pieces to invade along the c-file.
2. Advance ...
c7-c5-c4, and then attack the new base of the chain (the c3-pawn) with ... b7-b5-b4. This plan can be too slow ifWhite has good attacking chances on the kingside.
3. Trade light-squared bishops on the fl-a6
diagonal {say with ... b7-b6 followed by ...Ba6) or make good use of this bishop along the h7-b l diagonal.
4. Slow down White's kingside attack with
... f7-f5, or even fight for counterplay with the more confrontational ... f7-f6. White's Plans 1 and 2 are very effective while the centre remains firmly closed. The pawn chain and the spatial advantage prevent Black from effectively manoeuvring and defending the kingside. This allows White's checkmating arrack and even piece sacrifices to work very well. For this reason Black must find a way to break in the centre or slow down the attack with either Plan 1 or Plan 4, that is ... c7-c5, ... f7-f6, or ... f7-f5. White's Plan 3 (a kingside attack using pieces more than pawns, particularly a bishop on d3) is not one I will cover in much detail in this chapter. Tactics will dominate, so it is not a good fit for my purposes. The extreme example is the Greek Gift - the bishop sacs on h 7, then a knight check on g5 and queen to h5. All great fun and still winning a few points in the 2 1 st century, but a topic for another day. Black's Plan 1 can be very effective if White is unable to defend the d4-pawn or unable cover the c2-square, which is the entry point for Black's rooks. If White can protect both these points well, then this plan can be a big disappointment, since the capture ... cxd4 means Black no longer has a queenside break to execute. Meanwhile White can proceed with his desired kingside attack. Something to note about Black's Plan 2 is that this plan is rather slow, and therefore it is far more likely to work well if Black has castled long, away from White's kingside play. In such a case, this plan can also be combined with a potential kingside attack based on ... f7-f6, ... g7-g5 and so on. The first game in this chapter illustrates how White is able to give up control of the c-file and still have a good position as long as he can control Black's entry points (the c2- and cl-squares). White then proceeds with his standard f4-f5 plan. The second example illustrates a particular type of plan that is not always relevant to this structure {and partly for that reason I did not mention it in the list above) but is important if Black's light-squared bishop is exchanged on g6. Then once Black has recaptured with ... hxg6, White can go for an h4-h5 break and subsequent kingside attack. The third game is an example of Black's Plan 4 while the fourth game is a combination of Black's Plans 2 and 4. Then the last game brings together many of Black's ideas into one elegant example . Julio Granda Zuniga -Marc Narciso Dublan Zaragoza 201 2 Leaming objective: This game shows how White can give up the c-file, cover Black's entry points (such as c2) and then simply proceed with his standard kingside plans. The first twenty moves are irrelevant to our study. But I include them to show how this pawn structure can arise from many openings, and nor just from the French.

After an unusual start, we have reached the thematic structure. The reader should begin by assessing the position. Who is better? One of my students said, "Black's obviously better, as he dominates the c-file, and has a strong knight on c4." Then I asked, "How exactly do you make use of the c-file?" and suddenly he began to hesitate. When I first studied this game I thought White had to fight for equality, but this superficial evaluation was simply wrong. After a long analysis, I concluded Black is already in very serious trouble, as he cannot create serious threats on the queenside. Black's position looks okay, to say the least, but there aren't real entry points down the c-file, since the c2-square is protected. In addition, White does not have any weakness on the queenside. Then, why should White be better in this position? White's advantage is a result of his space, his ability to protect the c2-square and the d4-pawn. In addition, Black's kingside was weakened by ... g7-g6, which does not mix well with the e6-d5 chain by weakening dark squares and allowing White to break with h4-h5. The game continued:

2. Black was left without a plan because he
could not make use of the c-file and because it was not even worthwhile to attack the well supported d4-pawn. There are no other plans for Black to try in this position.
3. White's kingside attack rolls on very easily,
but Granda Zuniga's play on moves 22-30 is worthy of praise. White's forces were ideally synchronized to neutralize Black's play while preparing the f4-f5 break.

positional evaluation. White's d4-pawn was well protected, and the plan ... c5-c4, ...b 7 -b5-b4 was far too slow against White's h4-h5 break. lfBlackhad realized this opposite flank race was lost, he probably would have played 1 1 . .. �c? in order to castle long.

Pushing ... c5-c4 is often a double-edged decision. The pawn on c5 was attacking the base of White's chain, the d4-pawn. Once ... c5-c4 has been played, the new base of the chain is the c3-pawn and in order to attack it Black should play ... b 7-b5-b4 together with ... a7-a5. This plan is often stronger than attacking the d4-pawn, but it is also much slower. In fact, it is so slow that if Black were to castle short, then White would probably be able to deliver mate before Black manages to break with ...b5-b4; take the previous game as an example. In this game, Black will ensure the safety of his king by castling long. In such a case, White would like to insist on an attack by playing b2-b3 opening lines, but here this is not easy because he has already played a2-a3. That is essentially the strategic justification of the previous moves and this is why Black did not play ... c5-c4 until White had played a2-a3. Now let's see how the game continued.

Overall, chances are approximately equal as in the game Nakamura - Pelletier, Biel 2005. 11. ..O-O-O 12.i.g4 �b8 So far both players are followingratherstandard plans; Black's king is safe on the queenside, while White is ready to begin a kingside expansion.

This is not the best way to proceed. 1 3.f4 was a better alternative, and after 1 3. ..g6
14. l0df3 Bg7 1 5. Bh3 the position is complicated,
but chances are approximately balanced. White must expand on the kingside with extreme care, so as not to allow strong counterplay. For example, 1 5. .. l"!dg8 16.g4? would certainly be a premature decision, since now 1 6. .. h5! gives Black an excellent game. 13 ...

The position is critical and White needs to find the right way to react on the kingside.

But this is not it, as we shall see. It was better to play 1 6. l0g5!? improving the knight: 1 6. ..h6 1 7.l0h3 Be7 1 8.l0f4!? (or 1 8.f4!? with a normal position) Now the knight is pretty good on f4, as it makes it difficult for Black to play ... f7-f5 (or ... f7-f6) and helps prepare a slow-paced kingside expansion with g2-g3 and h2-h4-h5.

White does not realize how many problems he is about to face. In fact, this move makes Black's reaction even stronger, as the h5-pawn will become a target.

fS!! A wonderful move! A double exclamation mark is not an exaggeration: the move is both strong and nearly decisive. This is a reaction the reader should never forget: by using a tactical resource, Black achieves the ... f7-f5 push, after which he dominates the game for the following reasons: 1 . He clearly controls the queenside; he has nothing to fear on this flank.
2. He can now begin to expand on the kingside
with an eventual ...g7-g5.
3. He can easily create an attack against White's
king.
4. White is inferior on both flanks, hence he
cannot create counterplay. 18 . .Bh3 It is probably better to take on f6, in order to prevent Black's kingside expansion with ... g7-g5, but in this case 1 8 .exf6 gxf6 does not really help White either, since his position is so weakened: 19 . .!:'i:e l (not l 9�xe6?

�h7 White had to resign. 0-1 Final remarks 1 . The ... c5-c4 advance by Black had to be combined with long castling, and works especially well if White is unable to open the b-file with b2-b3.
2. Once Black has castled long, White may still
expand on the kingside, but there is a chance this plan could backfire as White's king can now become exposed.
3. Black's 1 7th move .. I5 was an extremely
strong blow. If Black manages to combine ... c5-c4 with the ... f7-f5 advance, then he has obtained a significant spatial advantage and White is in serious trouble all over the board. It is no surprise that Black was able to win easily afterwards, as there is little White can do to prevent Black's active kingside play based on the ... g7-g5 expansion. Chapter 2 1 - French Type III 395 Geetha Narayanan Gopal - Viktor Bologan Gibraltar 2012 Learning objectives: 1 .

This 'bad' bishop is actually very powerful when it is outside the pawn chain. l 6.�g2 O-O 17 .£5 And this is the most critical moment in the game.

This is a good moment to observe what a wonderful position Black has, for the following reasons: 1 . Black has completed his queenside plan with ... b7-b5-b4, and now he has a pleasant choice between ... bxc3 to create a vulnerable c3-pawn, or ...b4-b3 to later attack the even more vulnerable b2-pawn.
2. Black's 'bad' bishop is probably the most
powerful bad bishop I have ever seen.

Black's, and his kingside structure is completely inflexible.

0--1 Final remarks This game brought together many of the ideas learned throughout this chapter. Black did not capture with l 3 ...cxd4 as the first game in the chapter showed us the c-file is not useful if the entry points are covered, as was the case here. Later, Black implemented the ...f7-f6 break to gain counterplay along the f-file and to prevent White from further advance, in similar style to Gopal - Bologan. The ... f7-f6 break combined with having a bishop along the h7-bl diagonal meant Black was able to stop White's kingside play altogether. This gave him time to pursue the complete chain-advance plan. The advance ... c5-c4 turned the c3-pawn into the base, while the advance ... b4-b3 turned White's b2-pawn into the base of the chain. The b2-pawn was harder to defend than the c3-pawn, which in turn was harder to defend than the d4-pawn. Since Black had time, he decided to go after the b2-pawn and he succeeded. This game was a beautiful illustration of these concepts. Chapter 22 Miscellaneous The 3-3 vs. 4-2 Structure The 3-3 vs. 4-2 structure is very common. It typically arises from the Caro-Kann or Slav structures studied in Chapters 3 and 4. In the Caro Kann we obtain this structure once Black plays ... c5 and White captures dxc5. In the Slav it occurs after Black plays ...e5 and White replies dxe5. Note that in the second case we reach this structure with reversed colours. This structure may also arise from the Scheveningen Sicilian, as we will discuss later in this chapter. The faa that this position is open allows for massive piece exchanges and it is quite common for players of all levels to agree to a draw upon arriving at this structure, just because of its seemingly drawish nature. Nevertheless, both sides have some ambitious plans. 8 7 6 5 4 3 2
1 a b c d e f
g h White's plans 1 . Control the d-file and use it for a seventh-rank invasion if possible.
2. Pursue a majority attack. That is, advance the
queenside pawns to create a passed pawn. Black's plans 1 . Control the d-file and use it for a seventh-rank invasion if possible.
2. Pursue a minority attack with ... a7-a5 and
...b7-b5-b4. If this plan is successful Black will probably eliminate White's a-, b-, and c-pawns using his a- and b-pawns. Thereupon Black will attempt to win an endgame with 4 vs. 3 kingside pawns. Something to note is that both sides play on the queenside. This is quite logical since in the majority of cases the kings will be castled on the kingside. Attempting a kingside attack in such an open position is quite likely to backfire for either side. Of course there are exceptions to this rule, and an attack could succeed if pieces are already actively placed when we reach this structure. Nevertheless, I would not recommend starting a kingside attack from scratch as the opponent is likely to find a refutation in the centre or on the queenside. Chapter 22 - Miscellaneous 40 1 Something to be aware of is that because this structure is quite open, the pair of bishops tends to be more important here than in other structures studied in this book. Overall, this structure is quite simple strategically speaking, but it is by no means drawish, and it is good to know how to proceed with either side.

b5-pawn, which hinted that a queenside expansion would not be achievable hence White should stay passive.
3. White's biggest problem in this game was his
rather questionable opening, which left him fighting for equality from the very beginning. Black's play was impeccable. The Panov Structure
[diagram]
When you see the name 'Panov Structure' you might guessIQP, but instead I shall give this name to the structure you can see above, which usually originates from the Panov variation of the Caro-Kann after l .e4 c6 2.d4 d5 3.exd5 cxd5 4.c4 lLJf6 5.lLJc3 llJc6 6.lLJf3 when White later plays c4-c5. lhis structure may also arise from the Queen's Indian Defence, as well as any position with a Carlsbad structure. White's plans The main plan is clear: create a passed pawn on the queenside. If White is able to play b2-b4-b5 and later c5-c6, then he is likely to have a big advantage. Black's plans Black can counter this plan with two different approaches: 1 . Attack the front of White's chain (the c5-pawn) with ...b7-b6. This is done in order to trade the c5-pawn, eliminating White's most dangerous threat.
2. Attack the base of the chain (the d4-pawn) by
placing a knight on c6 and a bishop on f6. This is ofren combined with playing ... f7-f5 and placing a strong knight on e4. 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1

Black's Plans 1 and 2 can often be combined effectively. Overall the Panov structure is a relatively simple one, though we should know its basic plans. Here I present a couple of short fragments to illustrate how White creates a passed pawn, how Black fights for counterplay, and then we finish our discussion with an example of how a Carlsbad structure is convened into a Panov. Alexey Dreev- lvan Galic Kallithea 2008 Learning objective: This game illustrates how White's queenside majority can be advanced to dominate the game.

We obtain the structure of interest under excellent conditions for White because: 1 . Black's ...b7-b6 plan does not work in view of c5-c6 (or b3-b4). Either way, White preserves his strong pawn. 2 . Black is unable to exert pressure against the d4-pawn, as he cannot place a bishop on f6, or a knight on c6, or a knight on e4. I seriously question whether Black considered these factors when accepting this structure, as now he is stuck with a very passive position. 13• •.

We have reached a rather unexpected finish. Nevertheless, White's queenside strategy was a clear success and if Black had not weakened his kingside, then White could have easily won with a well-prepared c5-c6 advance. Here White has obtained a decisive attack and the game finished with:

2. The reader should notice how Black
essentially had no useful moves while White could advance his queenside majority and prepare the creation of a passed pawn. Also, it is noteworthy that White did not just push c5-c6 as soon as it became possible. Rather, it is important to prepare this move so that the pawn will not become stuck on c6, unable to advance further.

As it turns out, White does not need to take decisive action on the queenside. His pawn majority is already a big distraction, and now

Black has a very pleasant position; he is preparing ... tDe6-g5. Black eventually won, though this is not particularly relevant to us. What we have learned is how a Carlsbad structure can transpose into a Panov structure. 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 The Dragon Formation
[diagram]
The Dragon Formation arises almost exclusively from the Dragon or Accelerated Dragon lines of the Sicilian. It may also occur with reversed colours when White plays the English Opening and Black replies with 1 ... e5 followed by 2 ... tDf6 and 3 ...d5. Assuming we have the structure with colours the usual way around (say, from a Dragon) then Black almost always castles short while White must choose whether to castle short or long. This decision has a significant influence on the character of the resulting game. White's plans 1 . If White castles long, then he will assault Black's kingside with h2-h4-h5, and then attempt a mating attack along the h-file.
2. If White castles short, then he will play a
central strategy, place a rook on the d-file and a knight on d5. Black's plans 1 . If White castles long, then Black must create a queenside attack at all costs. Black will often play along the c-file as well as push his a- and b-pawns. An exchange sacrifice ... Ei:xc3, with the idea of doubling pawns, is often possible.
2. If White castles short, then Black can play a
more positional game along the c-file. Place a knight on c4, and again the idea ofan exchange sacrifice with ...�xc3 may be possible. Something to note about White's Plan 2 is that if Black captures the knight on d5 with a piece, and White recaptures with exd5, then the structure is very similar to the asymmetric transformation of the Maroczy, which we studied in Chapter 1 1 . After such a brief overview, many readers may wonder if the infamous Dragon is really that simple. The truth is that this structure often yields extremely complex positions, but the complexity is mostly tactical. There are few strategic elements to discuss, as most games are decided by brutal tactical shots. This is the reason I decided not to give a separate chapter to this structure. Nevertheless, one interesting idea in this structure is Black's exchange sacrifice on c3, and we will see an example of it. Chapter 22 - Miscellaneous 409

We are essentially outside of theory, though the exchange sacrifice is a very typical resource in this opening. White has to deal with the burden of the doubled c-pawns, which in many variations prevent him from carrying out a decisive kingside attack. The sacrifice is positionally and tactically well justified. If 1 4.�xc3 �xc3 1 5.bxc3 tt:lxh5 1 6.g4 tt:lf6 there are no weaknesses for White to attack, for example 1 7. .Bh6 a5 1 8 .a3 :gc8 19.Rb2 b5 20. .Bxg7 Rxg7 2 1 .:gh4 h5!? when Black is rock solid.

2. Once White took on a defensive role to protect
the doubled c-pawns, the game was practically won for Black, as there are no threats on the kingside while Black's queenside play keeps on rolling. White's queenside is so seriously damaged by the doubled c-pawns that White is unable to organize an effective defence.
3. It is important to note the key role being
played by Black's knight on e5, which covers many essential squares and prevents White's attack from succeeding. Chapter 22 - Miscellaneous 41 1 The Scheveningen Structure The Scheveningen structure is one of the most aciting and complicated pawn structures in chess. This structure can arise from almost every variation of the Sicilian, such as the Najdorf, Scheveningen, Classical, Paulsen, Taimanov and many other less prominent lines. Of course, this structure also arises very often in the English Opening with colours reversed when Black pays 1 ...e5 followed by 2 ... ll'lf6 and 3 ...d5. White's plans 1 . Launch a kingside attack with g2-g4-g5, h2-h4-h5 and then break with g5-g6.
2. Play f2-f4-f5 to pressure the e6-pawn and
create an attack along the a2-g8 diagonal.
3. Play f2-f4 and then e4-e5 and then later carry
out a kingside attack. Black's plans 1 . Achieve the central break ...d6-d5 to release 2 the position and activate his minor pieces. Play along the c-file, and place a knight on c4 to pressure the b2-pawn and undermine White's knight which is typically located on c3.
3. If White has castled long, then carry out a
queenside attack with ... b7-b5-b4, ...a7-a5-a4 and then the break ...b4-b3.
4. If White plays f2-f4, in some cases Black can
reply ...g7-g5 to fight for the control of the e5-square.
5. In some cases Black may sacrifice an exchange
on c3, in similar style to what we saw in the Dragon structure. Black will most likely castle short or on some occasions keep the king in the centre. Meanwhile, White's king must choose between long and short castling, which will greatly influence the development of the game. If White castles long, then his main lines plans will be 1 and 2 while Black will most probably focus on Plan 3. Instead, if White castles short, Black will focus on Plan 1 while White can still carry out a kingside attack. White's Plan 3 is more likely to work after short castling, because the rooks would be placed more favourably for this plan. Structure transformations lhis structure can transpose into some of the structures we have studied previously. 1 . If Black plays ... d6-d5 and White replies with e4-e5 then we obtain a French Type II structure (Chapter 1 5).
2. If Black plays ... d6-d5, White captures e4xd5
and Black recaptures with a piece, then we obtain a 3-3 vs. 4-2 structure.
3. If White plays f2-f4-f5, the pressure on e6
may provoke Black to play ... e6-e5 obtaining a NajdorfType II structure (Chapter 9).
4. On some occasions White may play c2-c4
arriving at a Hedgehog structure (Chapter 1 0). The second structure transformation above is often favourable for Black on a positional level. The reason is that Black often has his b-pawn already on b5, which is the starting point of Black's minority attack, as described earlier in this chapter. The 4th structure transformation is quite unlikely to work because White typically has his knight

The reason I do not cover it in more detail is because the strategic ideas in this structure are relatively simple while most of its complexity comes from tactical details which do not fit so well with the content of this book. I am a firm believer that the reader needs most help with strategic concepts, as tactical shots can readily be studied using the ever more powerful computer engines.

We have reached a very interesting position that deserves some comment. Black has achieved ev7rything one hopes for with the ... g7-g5 break; lets spell this out: 1 . Black has a colossal knight on e5, which essentially dominates the game.
2. Black is able to make good use of two half
open files (c and g) while White cannot easily do similar, especially with the d-file so cluttered.
3. White's e4-pawn is isolated and vulnerable.
Meanwhile, the bishop on d3 is close to useless. Something to note is that Black's king stayed in the centre, which is by no means a problem. In fact it is a standard approach in Scheveningen structures, especially after Black has installed a k�ight on e5, which ensures the safety of the kmg. Black has a great position, and White blundered just two moves later, so we will leave our analysis at this point, though the reader is encouraged to analyze this position and convince himself of Black's superiority. 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 Chapter 22 - Miscellaneous 4 1 5 The Benko Structure

f g h This structure is actually specific to the Benko variation which begins with l .d4 llJf6 2.c4 c5
3.d5 b5 4.cxb5 a6 5.bxa6. After the a6-pawn
drops, Black is a pawn down but has some positional advantages to compensate for it. They are: 1 . White has two pawn "islands", while Black 2 only has one rock-solid group of six pawns. Black will place his rooks on the a- and b-files, pressuring White's a- and b-pawns, preventing their advance.
3. White does not have obvious targets and may
have to limit himself to passive play for a long time in order to stabilize his position. Theory regards the Benko Gambit as being somewhat inferior, and in fact it is rarely seen at the elite level nowadays. Nevertheless, it is an excellent practical weapon to be used when one absolutely needs to win with Black. Now, a big question is: How should White play? There are two main strategies to be followed, and they are often combined: 1 . White must turn his queenside pawns into a fortress, which most probably will be on b3 and a4, combined with many minor pieces surrounding and defending these pawns.
2. Advance in the centre and obtain a central
break with e4-e5 or maybe f4-f5. These ideas are borrowed from the asymmetric Benoni structure from Chapter 1 2, and they are White's only active plan. That is, White must try one of these breaks sooner or later. If instead White attempts to trade his b-pawn for Black's c5-pawn, then White's a-pawn will hardly be enough to win, as it will be an easy target for Black's pieces.

[diagram]
The Closed Ruy Lopez structure pictured above is one that arises almost exclusively from the Ruy Lopez opening. It is a very interesting structure, but I decided not to have a full chapter about it because it originates from just one opening, and because it is closely related to the King's Indian structures. The nature of this position most closely resembles the King's Indian Type II structure, the only difference being the pawns on c3 vs. c4 (instead of c4 vs. c5) . This is in fact a big difference, as we will see in the typical plans for this position: White's plans 1 . Create a kingside attack with g2-g4, .!bbd2-fl g3-f5, sacrifice a piece on f5 if needed.
2. Create a kingside attack with f2-f4, by analogy
with Chapter 1 5.
3. Play on the queenside with b2-b4, a2-a4
and then invade on the a-file or attack one of Black's queenside pawns. Black's plans 1 . Create queenside play with ...a7-a5, . .. b7-b5-b4.
2. Expand on the kingside with ... f7-f5-f4 by
analogy with Chapters 1 5 and 1 6. 4 1 8 Chess Structures - A Grandmaster Guide A major structural difference between this structure and the King's Indian structures is that in the Ruy Lopez White doesn't have a spatial advantage on the queenside. Still, having a powerful pawn on d5 is always a plus and will allow White to create queenside play on occasion. Nevertheless, kingside plans are now more significant than ever for White, and it is important to keep them in mind as queenside play will not always work for him. Unlike pretty much all King's Indian-type positions, Black is now likely to succeed by playing actively on the queenside, though the kingside plans remain valid. But often White will pay so much attention to the kingside that Black will opt for queenside plans. For this reason, in many cases White will first devote his energies to closing the queenside, and only then move on to a kingside attack. WhiteWBilnocks the Queenside and s on the Kingside The position in the diagram occurred in the famous Karpov - Unzicker game from the Nice Olympiad of 1 97 4. Since this example is well-known to many, I will present it without annotations. The most important thing to observe is the position in the diagram. White has managed to block the queenside in a very original way: by placing the bishop on a7. In contrast to simply closing the queenside with pawns, having this bishop on a7 means White can re open the file whenever he wants. Nevertheless, this will not be necessary, as his kingside play will decide the game. Here, Karpov proceeded with:

Black resigns due to the threat of �a6. 1-0 Final remarks 1 . The faa that White obtained a superior position after some pawns were traded on the queenside should be no surprise. We have seen similar patterns in Chapter 14. The key is the spatial advantage provided by the d5-pawn and Chapter 22 -Miscellaneous 42 1 the c6-square. In this game, this is what made 2 it so easy for White to attack the b5-pawn. Black's biggest mistake was playing the premature l 2 ... c4, permitting the strong 1 3.b4. This move allowed White to neutralize Black's queenside play immediately, and later obtain chances for an advantage as the position opened up. The Lopez Formation � d���'·· 6 ,. �

Similarly to the King's Indian Complex which we studied in Chapter 1 8, the Lopez Formation is a very flexible structure. The name 'Lopez Formation' was introduced by Soltis in the 1 970's and refers to the fact that this structure almost always arises from the Ruy Lopez. In essence, this structure is one in transition. Depending on how White and Black proceed in the centre, this structure will be transformed in one of the following ways: 1 . White advances d4-d5 and later c3-c4, obtaining a King's Indian Type II structure (Chapter 1 5).
2. White advances d4-d5 and Black replies
... c5-c4, to obtain a Closed Ruy Lopez, which has just been covered.
3. White captures d4xe5 (or d4xc5) and Black
recaptures ...d6xe5 (or ...d6xc5), obtaining a typical transformation of the King's Indian Complex (Chapter 1 8) . 4 . Black captures ...e5xd4 and after c3xd4 White proceeds with d4-d5, obtaining an Asymmetric Benoni (Chapter 1 2) .
5. Black captures ...c5xd4 and after c3xd4 White
proceeds with d4-d5, obtaining a King's Indian Type I structure (Chapter 1 4).
6. Black trades two pawns on d4 with ...
c5xd4 followed by ...e5xd4 (or in the other order). The resulting position has not been discussed in previous chapters, and here we will see an example of it. David Navara-Ivan Sokolov Reykjavik 201 2 Learning objectives: 1 . This game is an example of Black's central counterplay after a double pawn trade on d4.

We have reached a critical position and it is time to make an assessment. In the long term White should have a huge advantage because the d6-pawn is a weak isolated backward pawn - an easy target. However, Black's pieces are arranged so well that it is not clear White will have a long term! Black's bishop is extremely powerful along the h8-al diagonal, pressuring the knight on d4 and the pawn on b2. Meanwhile White's bishop on h4 is rather useless, and would have been far better placed on b2 or e3. When Black decides to trade both pawns on d4, he must carefully assess whether he will have enough counterplay to compensate for the weak d6-pawn. In this case Black has made an excellent choice and in fact he is already better.

h? 0-1 Final remarks 1 . The d6-pawn was never a weakness. Instead, the e4-pawn was quite vulnerable, since playing f2-f3 would severely weaken the gl-a7 diagonal.
2. One of White's biggest problems was not
having the dark-squared bishop on b2 or e3, to parry the threats.
3. Black's counterplay was particularly successful
because of White's poor coordination. The double pawn trade on d4 would not work as well if White could manage to stabilize the position. Chapter 23 Level 1 Granda Zuniga -Vega, Bahia Feliz 20 1 I

Yucay 200 1 Since Black's light-squared bishop is inside the pawn chain, it makes sense to further restrict this bishop with:
13.c5!
Preventing a future ...c6-c5, and now: 13 ... b6 Hoping to undermine the c5-pawn and opening space for the bishop on c8, but weakening the c6-pawn. The alternative 1 3. ..�f6 is met by 14.�d6 �e8 1 5. �c4 when White has pleasant control of many key squares.

Belfort 2005 I spent about thirty minutes calculating the sharp continuations after my ... d5 advance, but it did not occur to me that White had a simple and strong thematic reply:

21. Penteala Harikrishna - Leinier Dominguez
Melilla 201 1 As explained in Chapter 7, the move e4-e5 can be useful to create mating threats. But in an endgame, this move can be more weakening and, as in the game Vovk - Volokitin (page 1 34), we would expect Black to establish a blockade on d5 and then create a decisive passed pawn on the queenside. This is exactly what happened after: 23 ... J.e? 24.�c3 �c6 25.J.e4 An option was 25.Jle3 lL!b4 26.Jlbl lL!d5

29. Rodrigo Vasquez- Adan Rios
Santiago 20 10 The Open King's Indian structure offers an advantage to White once he manages to stabilize his position. Here Black is tactically prepared to break in the centre, and he obviously must not miss this chance. The strongest move is: 13 ... dS! This break is usually very difficult to carry out, but when it works it has a spectacular effect, destroying White's apparently solid centre. A move such as 1 3. .. it)h5?! 14.iih2 'Wie7 (but 1 4. ..f5!? is a worthy alternative, breaking White's centre) 1 5. .Be3 would allow White to consolidate his position and slowly improve as in the game Meier - Feller (page 324).

Aix-les-Bains 201 1 This version of the Open King's Indian structure is not especially favourable for White, since two pairs of minor pieces are off the board already and the d6-pawn is supported. Hence, it is wise for White to change the structure favourably with:
