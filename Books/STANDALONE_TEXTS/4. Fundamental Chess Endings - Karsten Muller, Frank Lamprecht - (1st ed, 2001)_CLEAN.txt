One gains the impression that opening theory progresses at breakneck pace and that trying to master even part of it is practically a full-time job. In contrast, endgame theory advances at a more sedate pace and readers may wonder what a new end- game encyclopaedia has to offer that is not already in the classical works by Fine. Averbakh and others. To answer this question, I must first mention the three main influences driving endgame the- ory forwards. The first is simply the inevitable expansion of any field of human knowledge with time, as each generation builds on the work of the last. Endgame theory as expounded by Averbakh was more ac- curate and comprehensive than that of Fine, just as Fine was an advance over his predecessors. The second is of course the use of the computer. The construction of all 5-man and many 6-man databases has removed a large element of doubt from several areas of endgame theory. What was previously only guessed at can now be stated precisely. Finally, changes in the way chess is played, especially the introduction of faster time-limits, has led to a greater emphasis on the practical side of endgame theory. It is not enough to know that a po- sition is theoretically drawn; one also has to know the precise method of drawing it with limited time on the clock. Thus, there is an increased emphasis on concrete knowledge. As an example of how endgame theory has evolved, Fine's Basic Chess Endings ( 1941 ) had this to say about the ending W+A vs W: "This is a draw unless White has a BP or centre P on the seventh rank supported by the King." Even before the days of the computer, Averbakh had cast doubt on this statement by showing that there were good winning chances even if the king was not support- ing the pawn. He also showed that there were many winning chances with a knight's pawn on the seventh, and even in favourable cases with a rook's pawn. However, Averbakh only analysed a few positions with the pawn further back, so the result of most positions was still in doubt. Now the computer has shown that this ending is almost always a win with a bishop's pawn or centre pawn, except if the defending king is in front of the pawn or has a chance to get in front of the pawn (see p. 319). As another example, Fine mentioned three points "so fundamental that they must always be borne in mind", and the first of these was that "without pawns one must be at least a Rook ahead in order to be able to mate". He claimed that the only exceptions to this rule were the endings with two rooks against two minor pieces and four minor pieces against a queen (he apparently forgot his claim that W vs jL+4) is "won most of the time"). However, we now know of a host of other excep- tions; for example, W vs 2JI, 2JI vs H+JL vs 2Q, S+JL vs JL+4A with opposite-coloured bish- ops, W+A vs 22, etc. (see pp. 400-6). Indeed, there are now so many exceptions that Fine's 'rule' is found wanting. However, there will probably be no simple replacement because the databases have revealed many paradoxes. For example, the only ending with two minor pieces vs one minor piece to be generally won is 2$L vs fa, which perhaps seems natural enough in view of the power of the two bishops on an almost empty board. But how does one then explain the fact that with W vs two minor pieces, the only combination of minor pieces which generally draws is the two knights? Karsten Muller and Frank Lamprecht have incorporated these new trends in endgame theory in their book. They have achieved an exceptional level of precision in their coverage of the most fun- damental endgames by using computer databases. In more complex endings, they have not ne- glected general advice but there is an emphasis on the concrete analysis that is essential for the rigours of contemporary chess. Readers have a feast ahead of them, so it is time for me to finish and pass you over to Karsten, Frank and their silicon friends... Preface The fascinating world of chess endings has been explored in several complete works before: the five- volume Averbakh series, the five- volume Encyclopaedia of Chess Endings, Cheron's four- volume work, Batsford Chess Endings and Fine's Basic Chess Endings, to name just a few. There are also many books devoted to specific piece distributions. Our intention was therefore not to reinvent the wheel, but to connect the best from the past with the most suitable recent examples and research. We both have many years of experience as chess trainers and we can assure you that your en- gagement in endgame theory will soon repay itself. There are various reasons for this. First, except for some new developments in computer technology, endgame theory is rather static, so what you learn will be useful throughout your chess career. Also, the number of precise positions that you need to know by heart is relatively small and in many cases the knowledge of the general assess- ment, win, draw or loss, is enough. Far more important is the understanding of some frequently- occurring themes and motifs that will guide you through the endgame jungle. These principles won't just help you to improve your endgame play, but they will also strongly affect your middle- game decisions and play, especially regarding the matter of pawn play and good or bad exchanges. You will also improve your calculating abilities since in many endgame positions it is necessary to look several moves ahead, while due to the limited material it is somewhat easier to stay on track (han in a complex middlegame position. Fundamental Chess Endings is primarily conceived as a textbook and is divided into 12 chap- ters with exercises. We start with the basic mates and continue with chapters on all endings where each side has at most one piece, plus sections on some of the most important endings with addi- tional pieces. The statistics (see page 1 1) were only a rough guideline for the space we assigned to particular endings. For instance, we devoted a lot of space to rook endings as they occur most often in practice, and to pawn endings as they are fundamental for all other endings. Some endings with more pieces, such as double-rook endings or queen against two rooks, are also covered, and in Chapter 1 1 some general endgame principles are explained using endings with more material. At (he end of each chapter or section, rules and principles for the specific ending are given. Study them carefully - you should know them by heart! A list of selected reference works is also given in the >ame place. A few words about how to work with the book: it is certainly possible to study the chapters in an- other order than indicated, but the underlying endings should come first, since otherwise you might skip important rules or definitions. Don't try to read the book too fast, as many positions can't be understood just by a short look at the diagram and reading the text. You will get the most out of the material by playing through the variations on a board or with a computer. Also try hard to solve the exercises, and don't become despondent if you have problems; even masters usually can't solve them in seconds! For the five-man and the pawn endings we used the Nunn Convention (page 13). Note that for these assessments we ignore the 50-move rule, but we emphasize it when it has profound influence on the play, as in the ending rook and bishop vs rook (without pawns). Throughout the book, we have used a player-centred approach, so a c-pawn on the seventh rank is on c7 if it is white and on c2 if it is black. Writing this book was no easy task, but fortunately it wasn't a lonely one either. We would like to thank Georg von Billow, Martin Voigt, Christian Wilhelmi and Werner Muller for advice and proof-reading, and Rafael B. Andrist, Tim Bogan, Thies Heinemann and Christopher Lutz for pointing out inaccuracies in the first printing of Fundamental Chess Endings. Some material from section A2d on pp. 201-4 and section A on pp. 304-5 originally appeared in a modified form in the Endgame Corner column on the Chess Cafe website; thanks are due to Hanon W. Russell for
10 FUNDAMENTAL CHESS ENDINGS
allowing us to use this material. We would also like to thank Edward Winter and John Emms. Spe- cial thanks go to ChessBase (without the endgame tablebases and the calculating power of the lat- est programs like Fritz 6 and Nimzo 8 we wouldn't have dared to start this project!) and to Gambit Publications for the initial idea to write this book and a cooperative attitude throughout. Especially Graham Burgess and John Nunn did a marvellous job, just as with our first book Secrets of Pawn Endings, While careful work has been done, some mistakes are unavoidable and we offer thanks in ad- vance for any corrections by our readers. Finally, we have this dream that at some moment you will show your friend the beautiful queen sacrifice from the first round, but immediately afterwards comes this splendid endgame perfor- mance where you outplayed your strong opponent from a completely level position!

Thus, every move that leads to a position that has to be reached if the defender plays appropriately gets an exclamation mark. The exception is that if there is only one legal move, it doesn't get an exclamation mark. !! A particularly beautiful or hard-to-see exclamation-mark move. ? A move that changes the result of the position. Of course, the result can only be changed in a negative way. ?? An obvious or very unfortunate question-mark move. !? A move that makes one's task easier or creates problems for the opponent. A move that makes it easy for the opponent or causes oneself unnecessary difficulties. We demonstrate the convention with the following study:

Important Note We have used the Nunn Convention throughout the analysis if the starting position of an example is a five-man endgame (which can be checked with tablebases) and in Chapter 2 (on pawn endings). If ue apply it in other examples we give (NC) after the first move where we started to use it and it is \alid for the whole variation from that point on. Other Signs and Symbols Move Assessments When the Nunn Convention is not being used, the move-assessment symbols have the following, more standard, meanings: !! a very beautiful and strong move ! a strong move !? an interesting move ?! a dubious move ? a bad move ?? a blunder Other Symbols White is winning White is clearly better and should win White is a little bit better but his advantage shouldn't be enough for a win The position is equal or drawn Black is a little bit better but his advantage shouldn't be enough for a win Black is clearly better and should win Black is winning
I +
+ +1 +11 II 11+ 1+ I
Next to the diagrams we use the following symbols: W The position is considered with White to move B The position is considered with Black to move W/B The position is considered both with White to move and with Black to move In the diagrams there are the following symbols: o a critical square ★ a key square
[diagram]
Figures like 1 or la mark the corresponding squares Below the diagrams you will find signs like +/=. The sign in front of the slash gives the evalua- tion from White's point of view with White to move, while the sign after the slash is the evalua- tion with Black to move from his point of view. Therefore: +/= means that White to move wins, while Black to move can draw. /- means that Black to move loses, and we do not discuss the position with White to move. It might be uninteresting for us or meaningless (e.g., Black's king might be in check). With the exercises it is different. Stars replace the signs, and they are located next to the diagram. They mean: * easy ** medium *** difficult ♦*** very difficult ***** extremely difficult
OTHER SIGNS AND SYMBOLS 15
Thus: '**/ means that White is to move in this difficult exercise. "*/* means that it is a two-part exercise: with White to play it is of medium difficulty, while the Black-to-play case is easy.

Or 10Wc8#. The procedure is quite easy. One just has to be careful not to stalemate the opponent. The queen cuts the king off, then the attacking king approaches and the defender is forced back. The attacker could even win if it were possible to pass. This is different from king and rook vs king. Longest win (the number of moves the at- tacker needs to mate from the worst position that is still winning): 10 moves (w<&al, Rb2; bNf5).
1.2 King and Rook vs King
There are two completely different winning techniques for the attacker. The first is based on the opposition of the kings with the rook being far away: You must of course have learned to mate with queen or rook in one of your first chess lessons, so you might want to skip the first two sections of this chapter, but you might be able to mate more quickly if you study them. The most important mate here is the one with knight and bishop, which might be unsolvable with limited time and knowledge (even grand- masters have failed in over-the-board situa- tions). In this chapter we consider:
1.1: King and Queen vs King 16
1.2: King and Rook vs King 16
1.3: King and Two Bishops vs King 17
1.4: King, Bishop and Knight vs King 17

Two bishops of the same colour cannot, of course, mate a bare king. Note that Ken Thompson's computer data- base proved in 1983 that two bishops even over- come king and knight. For this subject we refer the reader to Secrets of Minor-Piece Endings, where John Nunn deals with it extensively (pp. 265-81). Two bishops against one is on the other hand usually drawn; for example, if you add a black bishop on b2 in the position after
14...<£118 above White can't make any progress
(even an additional white pawn on h7 wouldn't help due to the wrong rook's pawn - see Chap- ter 4!).
1.4 King, Bishop and Knight
vs King This ending is quite tricky, especially as the 50-move rule can easily come to the defender's aid if the attacker makes a few slips. King, bishop and knight share the work in the follow- ing manner: • The attacking king generally stays in oppo- sition (see 2.07A, C) to, or a knight's move away from, the defending king. It normally stays on squares of opposite colour to the bishop.
18 FUNDAMENTAL CHESS ENDINGS
• The knight stands near the kings because of its nature as a short-range piece, and covers flight-squares of the colour the bishop can't control. • The bishop is very fast and can easily create zugzwang situations. Mate can only be forced in a comer which is controlled by the bishop; we call these comers the 'right' cor- ner. The winning procedure consists of the fol- lowing steps: 1 ) Forcing the king to the edge of the board. 2) The defending king may have to be forced from the 'wrong' to the 'right' comer. 3) Mating the king in the 'right' comer. The win is most often spoiled by wrong knight moves. It is essential to know the follow- ing pattern by heart: starting position is just reached two files shifted to the left: 2,..<Nf8 3 ftd7+ <Ne8 4 *e6 *d8 5 ±d6, and now: a) 5...*c8 6 c5*d8(6...*b8 7*c6*c8 8 ftb7 +-) 7 Ng6 *c8 8 i_f7 *d8 (8...*b8 9 *d7 *a7 10 *c7 *a8 1 1 Nc4 <Na7 12 #)d7 *a8 13 Nb6+ *a7 14 2)c8+ *a8 15 Jld5#) 9 Nb7+ transposes to line 'b'. b) After 5...Ne8 6 Ng6+ *d8 7 Nf7 Black's king has been driven two files further in the di- rection of the dangerous comer.

At first sight it is a bit surprising, but king and two knights cannot mate a lone king by force because stalemate situations arise when the king is stuck near a comer. However, if the de- fender has a pawn, it can provide the desired tempi. The Russian theoretician Troitsky made a detailed study of this endgame and discovered the following rule:

The Troitsky Line
20 FUNDAMENTAL CHESS ENDINGS
If the pawn is securely blockaded by a white knight no further down than the line, then Black loses, no matter where the kings are. If the pawn has advanced beyond the line, there is usually a drawing and a losing zone for the defending king, which were also analysed by Troitsky. To illustrate the mating technique, we give the following example where the black king is already caged: Longest win: 1 15 moves. John Nunn points out the impressive number of 3,124 reciprocal zugzwang positions in the ending two knights vs pawn.

2 Pawn Endings
It is no exaggeration to say that pawn endings form the basis of endgame play in general. Af- ter all, it is always good to know if an exchange of the last pieces is a good idea. You might think that it is simple to master these innocent- looking endings, but in many cases this sim- plicity is deceptive. Even the easiest pawn end- ings require very careful play; it is not unusual at all for a sequence of 'only' moves to be re- quired to achieve the desired result. Moreover, the second-best move in a winning position might even lose! To sharpen the reader's eye for this matter, the Nunn Convention is used throughout the chapter. One final word before we start: it is certainly a pleasure to write this chapter if you have just recently written a book exclusively devoted to pawn endings, but it is also a curse. First you have so little space for all the beautiful studies, and second you want to present the necessary knowledge using fresh examples without any loss in quality. It is up to our 'old' readers to say whether we have succeeded. This chapter is divided up as follows:
W/B

Rule of the Square see more quickly whether the pawn will run through to queen. The Rule of the Square: if the king can reach the square of the passed pawn, then it can cap- ture the pawn; if not, the pawn can queen with- out the aid of its own king. If the pawn is on its original square, the double step must be taken into consideration, so the square is the same as if the pawn has advanced one square. The square rule is also valid for the rook's pawn. When there are more pawns on the board, one has to watch out for moves that block the king's way into the square of the enemy passed pawn. If the king can support its pawn, it is of course different (see following diagram). From d7 the king controls the pawn's path to e8, so White wins no matter where Black's king is. d7 is called a key square of the e6-pawn. Definition: when the king occupies a key square, this secures the win, no matter where Black's king is. So for the e6-pawn, d8, d7, e8, e7, f8 and f7 are key squares. Of course, Black's king mustn't be able to capture the pawn at once. If the pawn is on e5, then d7, d6, e7, e6, f7 and f6 are key squares. For a pawn on e4, the key squares are d6, e6 and f6, while for a pawn King + Pawn(s) vs King 21 Small Number of Pawns 27 Pawns on One Wing 37 Passed Pawns 40 Pawns on Both Wings 46 Corresponding Squares 51
2.1 King + Pawn(s) vs King
We start with the king's pawn, but you can ap- ply our results also for the queen's, the bishop's and the knight's pawns. In the following diagram, White's king can't help its pawn, which can only queen if White is to move: 1 e6! Nb5 2 e7! <Nc6 3 e8W+ If Black is to play, the pawn can't escape the black king: l...Nb5!

disadvantageous; in other words, passing would be by far the best move, if the rules allowed such a thing. In 2.03 whoever is to move is in zugzwang. This is known as reciprocal zugzwang. Zug- zwang situations are important in nearly all types of endgame; they are often easier to de- tect with the question: "What would my oppo- nent play if it were his move?". Naturally, that question helps to spot threats as well. The following position demonstrates that the pawn on e5 has six key squares. In general, a pawn that has crossed into the opponent's half of the board has six key squares (but on e7 it has only five). White can win this position whoever moves first.
2.02
on e3 they are d5, e5 and f5. Finally, for a pawn on e2 they are d4, e4 and f4. Before we explain why there are six key squares for a pawn on the 5th or 6th rank and only three for a pawn on the 2nd, 3rd or 4th rank, the following position should be studied:
W/B
With White to move, the zugzwang known from the previous example applies: 1 e6 Ne8 2 e7! Nf7 3 d7! +-. If Black is to move, White has the opposition and penetrates to the 7th rank: l...Ne8 2 Ne6! (but not 2 e6? idS! 3 e7+ e8! 4 <i?e6 stale- mate) 2...Bd8 3 Nf7! +-. If the king doesn't occupy a key square, it is always drawn if the pawn advances with check. With a knight's pawn, more care is required because the edge is so near (see following dia- gram)'. White to move wins only with 1 Nh6! (after
1 Nf6?! Black has l...Nh7!? forcing White to

Everything depends on the right to move. If White is to play, he can't make progress: 1 e7+ (with check; 1 Ne5!? <±>e7 2 *f5 <Ne8! 3 <Nf6 Nf8 ! =) l...Ne8! 2 Be6 stalemate. If Black is to move, he loses because he can't prevent White from reaching the key square d7: L.-i'eS (1...S&C8 2 e7 +- ) 2 e7! (the pawn ad- vances to the 7th rank without check and so its promotion can't be stopped) 2...Nf7 3 Nd7! 4-. In 2.03 it would have been better for both sides to pass than to move. Definition: a position is called zugzwang when the mere fact that one side has to move is

2.07A
The normal opposition If we speak of opposition, most often this form is meant.
W/B
2.06
With White to move, 2.06 is only drawn, as Black's king can defend the key squares d6, e6 and f6: 1 *e5 *e7! 2 *f5 *f 7! 3 e5 Be7! 4 e6 Be8! 5 Bf6 Bf8! = (2.03). With Black to move, he loses the fight for the key squares and the position: l...Be7 2 Be5! Bd7 3 if 6! Bd6 4 e5+! Bd7 5 Bf7 +-. The position of the kings on e5/e7 is called opposi- tion. Rule: The opposition is the most important weapon in the fight for three adjacent key squares. Whoever loses the opposition also loses the fight for the key squares. However, if there are fewer than three adjacent key squares, then
2.07B
The distant opposition White has the distant opposition on the d- file, as it is Black's move. If d6, e6 and f6 are the critical squares (i.e., if the e-file is the main file), then White first has to take the distant op- position on the e-file:

The second position is of great importance and should be studied closely, because it dem- onstrates how the attacker should proceed when his pawn is far back: W Having a rook's pawn reduces the winning prospects considerably:

E.Pogosiants, 1961 Two pawns up, your aim is clearly to win, but how to achieve it? We will explain the posi- tion while using a powerful weapon: the method of exclusion. First thought: Black's threat is to take on d7 and then run with the king to either b6 or b7. Obviously there is just one move to prevent this: 1 *e6! Rule: if every other candidate move fails, play the remaining one. Black's answer is clear: l...*d8 After 1 Ng5 d7 2 Nf6 #e8 3 *g7! +- White has reached one key square and can now advance and queen his pawn without difficul- ties.

(2.11) V2-V2.
If the attacker has more pawns, he usually wins easily. If they are connected passed pawns, he is always winning (if the opponent is not stalemated, of course, or one can be captured and the other stopped):
PAWN ENDINGS 27
Now the same thinking process again: 2 b6 and 2 Sifrd6 fail because of stalemate, and only
2 Nd5 remains. Play it! The other king moves

4...*c8 5 <±>c6! +- (2.03)
The method of exclusion is mainly used to save time: let your opponent think in his time if your move is clear. Certainly the method is valid in the middlegame and opening as well, but there are two points to worry about. First you have to be sure that your candidate list is complete and that you made no error in the calculation of the moves you exclude. Second: suppose you desperately want to win, you have only three moves, the first two draw and so us- ing the method you quickly play the third - un- fortunately that one loses! Note: Averbakh ascribes the position to Pog- osiants, who probably followed Troitsky: wSfrh2; b<S?e4, Af2, h4. White to move draws by play- ing 1 <S?g2! (Novoe Vremia, 1898).

1 ) The opponent's pawn has to be conquered and 2) A key square has to be reached. The following position is critical: If both kings occupy the critical squares di- rectly adjacent to the pawn, an important situa- tion of reciprocal zugzwang is reached:

If the kings are one square further away, it is the other way around: Whoever has the move wins the opponent's pawn, but only for White is this sufficient to win the game, because in the act of capturing the g6-pawn, he conquers a key square of the g5- pawn: 1 *e5! *f7 2 *d6! *f8 3 *e6! *e8

7 g6 *g8 1-0
The game shows that Black can't defend his pawn if the white king reaches d6. This means that the squares d6, e6 and f6 are critical squares of the g6-pawn (if the white king occu- pies one of them the pawn is lost). If the pawns are blocked, the three squares directly adjacent to the pawn are critical. For White, the critical squares of the g6-pawn are also key squares, because taking the pawn reaches a winning po- sition. With Black to move it is different. He can reach the critical squares (d5, e5 and f5) of the g5-pawn using the opposition (fight for three directly adjacent squares), but this is not suffi- cient to win the game because White's king can defend the key squares of the g6-pawn: l...*e6 2 *f4 *d5 3 *f3 *e5 4 *g4 *e4 5 *g3 *f5 6 *h4 *f4 7 *h3 *xg5 8 <Ng3! = (see 2.06).

C) Both Sides Have Passed Pawns In this case one must be alert to possibilities for either king to support its own pawn while stop- ping the advance of the enemy pawn. One of the key subtleties in the play is the idea of forcing the opponent's king to a square that allows one's own pawn to queen with check.

in five moves (it can't go to c8, because the b6-pawn would fall), but Black would move to a6 and win. Therefore he should seek a draw by defending the key squares of the black b-pawn (a5, b5 and c5), so that after ...Nxb6, he can re- ply Nb4. As every tempo counts (Black needs five moves to take the pawn; White needs six to reach b4, but he is to move), White has to be careful that Black's king doesn't shoulder him away. 1 *g3I! White takes a curve to get to b4! Not 1 Ng4? Nc2!, and now: a) 2 Nf3 Nd3 ! (shouldering away!

Looking at this theme is worthwhile: the mo- tif of shouldering away (the kings try to pre- vent each other from reaching a certain aim) is quite common in endgames. One should be aware of an important feature of the chessboard: its special geometry. From our schooldays we know that a straight line is the shortest route be- tween two points. For the kings on the chess- board this is only valid for the diagonals. White obviously has only one possible way to get from h4 to el in three moves. However, if the king has to reach b4 in six moves as in 2.23, then it has 141 different ways to get there (if the black king is ignored). Only very seldom do all the routes have equal merit. Often it is the outside curve, sometimes only a zigzag course, that leads to success. You should therefore always carefully consider which route is best. The masterpiece in the following diagram il- lustrates the geometry of the board very well. It seems as if White is completely lost be- cause he can't prevent the h-pawn from queen- ing, but he has a saving resource:

An additional black pawn on a5 wouldn't save Black as it falls prey to White's king. How- ever, adding a black pawn on b5 in 2.25 leads to a drawn position because Black's king can de- fend it from c6 (inside the square of the f5- pawn!).

This position has already been deeply stud- ied in various sources (e.g. The Final Count- down) and we also devoted a lot of space to it in SoPE. F) Bahr's Rule If two rook's pawns are blocked and the outside passed pawn is further away, Bahr's Rule helps to determine whether the position is winning (of course it is also possible to evaluate it by pure calculation, but note that simply counting the number of moves needed is very risky be- cause of a possible bodycheck!). Requirement: the attacking king stands next to its passed pawn, and the defending king in front of it. 1 ) If the attacker's blocked rook's pawn has crossed the middle of the board, he wins. Oth- erwise: 2) Draw the diagonal from the defender's pawn towards the defender's first rank. From the point of intersection of that diagonal with the c-file (or f-file, in case the blocked pawns are h-pawns), draw a diagonal (the 'border di- agonal') towards the attacker's first rank. If the pawn is on or below that border diagonal, the attacker wins; if it is above, then the position is drawn. We apologize if the description makes it sound complicated. Visually, the idea is readily grasped, as will become clear if we consider an actual example (see following diagram): The diagonals go from a5 to c7 and from c7 to h2. The pawn is on the diagonal, so White wins: l*d4 After 1 f5+? White's pawn is above the bor- der diagonal and the position is drawn: 1...4T6

The presence of rook's pawns makes it more likely that the defender can hold on. In some cases even knight's pawns are too near the edge. We give several examples of such fortresses. In 2.31 A (see diagram at the foot of the pre- vious column), 1 'i'eS <Bh8 2 is stalemate. The position remains drawn if the blocked pawns are the base of a pawn-chain; e.g., add black pawns on g6 and f5 and white pawns on g5 and f4.

2.4 Passed Pawns
The handling of passed pawns plays an impor- tant role in endgame theory in general and in this respect pawn endings are no exception. It is clear that the king has to deal with any passed pawn personally and so even if it is impossible to queen a pawn directly, it will often lead to a decisive deflection, granting the attacker a free hand on the other wing. Our topics are: 239 +/- R.Biolek - L.Keitlinghaus Ostrava 1993 rule: 'candidate in front'. Definition: a candi- date is a pawn that has no opposite number on its file. Advancing it first serves the purpose of avoiding structures with backward pawns. Black in turn must decide if he just waits or if he advances his pawns to exchange more pawns. With the pawn still on h7 it would be best just to sit and wait, but as the pawn is on h6 Keitling- haus decides to advance it further and set a trap:
3...h5
Or: a) 3...g5 4 g3 h5 5 f4 g4 6 h4! *f6 7 Ne4 -f-. b) White can break the other strategy as fol- lows: 3... Se5 4 f4+ 'i'dS 5 g4 i'db 6 *Be4 'S'eb

A: King vs Passed Pawns 40 B: Protected Passed Pawn vs Two Passed Pawns 42 C: Protected Passed Pawn vs Passed Pawn D: Outside Passed Pawn 44 E: Breakthrough 45 A) King vs Passed Pawns We start with some preliminary observations regarding the battle of king against passed pawns:
2.40A
The king can easily halt two connected passed pawns. However, he can't actually cap- ture them, since taking the backward one would
PAWN ENDINGS 41
The pawns can't protect themselves. If Black is to move, he wins both of them: 2 d6
3 g5 Nxd6! 4 g6 Ne6.
The rule of the common square can be used to evaluate such races. Draw a line from the more backward pawn to the file of the other pawn and complete it to make a square. If this square reaches the eighth rank, then one of the pawns will queen. This is the case with White to move: lg5! The pawns' common square has reached the eighth rank, so Black's king can't stop them: l...*e7 2 g6! *f6 3 d6! Nxg6 4 d7 If the pawns are separated by three files, they can defend themselves again. The following po- sition is critical: mean leaving the square of the more advanced one. Obviously, the defending king has no chance if the enemy king can come to support its pawns. On the other hand, the pawns cannot ad- vance by themselves and will be lost if they have to move due to zugzwang. If the pawns are separated by one file, the sit- uation is very similar:
2.40B
Black can stop the pawns easily by moving back and forth between d7 and d6. However, an attempt to win them is doomed to fail. If Black takes the d5-pawn he leaves the square of the f- pawn and if he tries to attack the f-pawn with l...Ne8?, then 2 d6! puts him in zugzwang. If the pawns have to move, they are lost as in the previous example. If the pawns are separated by two files, it is completely different:
2.40D
If Black is to move, he mustn't try to win one of the pawns, but should keep both options open by moving back and forth on the squares e5, e4 and e3. White loses the pawns only if he has to move them: l...Ne5! (not l...Nd5? 2 g4! Ne4 3 c4', when the common square has reached the eighth rank) 2 g4 <Nf4! 3 c4 Nxg4!
4 c5 *f5! .
If White is to move, he queens one of the pawns: 1 g4 Ne5 2 c4! Nd4 3 g5! <£ )xc4 4 g6. Passed pawns separated by four or more files usually cannot be stopped by the lone king. The last important issue of this type is how the king fares against three connected passed pawns (see following diagram). Normally three connected passed pawns are too much for the king. However, if they are not

Averbakh discusses the situation of 2.40E in more detail (see Av 442-59). B) Protected Passed Pawn vs Two Passed Pawns The square of the protected passed pawn plays the main role in evaluating such positions. If it is far-advanced or the square is very far away from the passed pawns, the position is usually drawn. Otherwise the attacker has good win- ning chances (see fallowing diagram). The d4-pawn limits White's king, but doesn't stop it leading its pawns to the 8th rank: 1 *e4 4>g4 2 h4 *h5 3 4>f4 Nh6 4 g4 4>g6 5 h5+ *h6 6 4>e4 Note that White can manoeuvre freely inside the square of Black's protected passed pawn, whereas Black has to oscillate between h6 and g5-

After the breakthrough of a pawn-majority that was already very far advanced, here is a very surprising one: C.Cozio, 1766 W White's pawns are very far advanced and the black king is outside their square. These are good signs that a breakthrough will be success- ful: 1 b6! cxb6

We hope these three examples have alerted you to watch out for possible breakthroughs. There are several factors that favour a break- through: flexible far-advanced pawns, weak- nesses in the pawn-structure (e.g. doubled pawns) and a defending king that is too far away from the action (i.e. the square of a potential passed pawn). You may find additional material in the exercises (E2.05 and E2.06).

Y.Averbakh If the two sides have a majority on different wings, the shorter majority often has the advan- tage. In particular, a 2-1 majority is beneficial, because after its mobilization there remains a protected passed pawn or else there is no enemy pawn left. A 3-2 or 4-3 majority may therefore be weaker, as the defender can often keep one pawn, which he can later make into a passed pawn by counterattacking on that side with his king. Thus the deflection value of the outside majority is reduced. But returning to a 2-1 ma- jority, our first example is clear-cut (see follow- ing diagram). Black wins easily, even though his king seems to be far away from the action. The winning plan falls into two phases. Firstly, Black acti- vates his king: The conversion of the extra pawn falls into three phases: 1) The king is activated: 1 &fl *e7 2 Ne2 <Nd6 3 Nd3 *d5 2) Mobilization of the majority:
4 b4 *c6 5 *c4 h5 6 a4 h4 7 b5+ Nb6 8
*b4 g5 9 a5+ Nb7 10 *c5 *c7 11 b6+ axb6+ 12 axb6+ *b7 3) The king goes to the kingside to gobble up the black pawns (transformation of one ad- vantage into another): 13 *d6 *xb6 14 *e7 f5 15 *f6 +- The following pawn-structure can arise from the Exchange Spanish, so it is important to deal with it:

For this extreme form of a fight for tempi, the following rule is applicable: If both sides have no or the same number of spare tempi then one should not move to the 'don 't touch me' square, but stay a short dis- tance away.

2.6 Corresponding Squares
The theory of corresponding squares is one of the most difficult topics in pawn endgames and so far we have only covered the most important special cases: opposition and triangulation.
52 FUNDAMENTAL CHESS ENDINGS
However, the theory is more general: when cor- rectly employed, it offers clear solutions to oth- erwise very difficult positions. The theory is mainly applicable to blocked positions, where king manoeuvres play the main role. It is also relevant to zugzwang positions. The ideal case is a system of squares where both kings are in reciprocal zugzwang. That means, for example, that if White moves to a particular square, then Black has to move to the corresponding square in order to draw; White should seek to move to squares in such a way that the black king is unable to keep moving to the corresponding squares, either because it is already there or be- cause it can't fly. Of course, not all cases where the theory can be successfully applied fit this ideal picture - pawn moves or counterattacks may disrupt the pattern. We will start with a famous example to illustrate what this is all about: White threatens to reach a key square or move to a square marked 4, so f3 = 5 is the correspond- ing square (protects the key squares and is next to 4). If the white king is on fl, Black has to move to e3. However, fl gets no number be- cause after l...Ne3?, 2 &f 1?? would even lose due to the counterattack 2...Nd2!. Because of the edge of the board, White has only al = 6 for manoeuvring. It corresponds to b5. If Black is to move, he can secure a draw by using the theory:
1...*f3!

N.Grigoriev Izvestia, 1921 2.62 (d2 = 1 = f3) +/- N.Grigoriev Naturally, the main question is how the kings K Novoi Armii, 1920 should manoeuvre. Therefore, one should deter- mine first the key squares, then the correspond- ing squares near the key squares, followed by the rest of the system. The key squares are e2, f2 and b3, a3. If the key squares are not con- nected, we should identify the shortest route between them. For White to get from b3 to e2, the route is a2-bl-cl -d 1 and Black has to de- fend via b4-c5-d4-e3. As both sides have ex- actly one shortest route, the squares along the way correspond to each other. We number them from 1 to 4. Next we investigate the squares near the key squares: el gets a 5. From here The key squares are d4, e2 and e3. We start the numbering near the key squares: d2 = 1 cor- responds to f3 = 1, because Black can't leave the square of the d-pawn. From c3 = 2 it is pos- sible to go to d2, so Black has to go to e3 = 2. The squares on the first rank don't get numbers because a counterattack against the d-pawn would be possible, but on the c- and b-file there are further corresponding squares: from c2 = 3 White threatens to go to I or 2 so Black has to be on f4 = 3. Finally, from b2 or b3 White can reach the 2 or 3, but Black has only one square

If this isn't possible, the threat (at the moment occupation of b1 = 2 or b2 = 4) has to be parried. If Black is to move, he achieves this with l...Nb7 or l...Nb8. The attacker (White) has to occupy a corre- sponding square or move in such a way that the defender can't go to the corresponding square. The attacker should approach the key squares if possible. If not, he should not move further away. Thus, if it is White's turn to play, he should oc- cupy the corresponding square to a7: 1 £bl! Not: 1 Nb2? Na8! ! =; 1 Na2?

Em.Lasker and G.Reichhelm Chicago Tribune, 1901 The key squares are b5, g5 and h5. The shortest route between them for White is c4- d3-(e2/e3)-(f2/f3)-g3-h4 and for Black b6-c7- (d7/d8)-(e7/e8)-(f7/f6)-g6 (the vertical lines in the diagram indicate that the squares el-e3 correspond to the squares d7-d8 and that f2/f 3 corresponds to e7/e8 and g3 to f6/f7). On the kingside Black has more squares and we only number h4 = 6 = g6. If Black's king has arrived on the kingside he has the possibility of a coun- terattack against the white f-pawn, so White can't simply go back and try again. It is clear now that for the system on the queenside, the distance to the kingside is of interest. The squares on the d-flle for White correspond to squares on the c-file for Black. It follows: c4 = 1 - b6, d3 = 2 = c7, c3 - 3 = b7, d2 = 4 = c8, c2 = 5 = b8. The remaining squares on the b-file and the first rank carry no new threats and so no new numbers have to be introduced. The squares on the b-file have an additional 'a', because Black can defend on the c-file and on the a-file ac- cordingly. Furthermore we have a7 = 2a and a8

(Note that we ignore the key squares d6 and d7 in the diagram; they induce the corresponding squares c7-e7 and c8-e8, but although White can use them by 1 Nb2? Nh8 !!
2 Nb3 Ng8! 3 Nb4 £18! 4 Nb5, it doesn't ac-
tually help him.) We proceed to label d3 = 3 = g6. Then we mark c4, c3, c2, d2 and e2 = 4-8, which correspond to f7, g7, h7, h6 and h5 re- spectively. For the other squares, no new num- bers have to be introduced. Squares on the a-file are not numbered due to the possible counterat- tack against the e4-pawn. If White goes to the f-file, Black can oscillate between g6 and h6. so the correspondence is not one-to-one. If Black is to move, he can draw with either l...Ng7 or L..Nh7 White to play can win as follows: l£bl! Not: 1 Nb2? Nh8 ! I 2 Nb3 Ng8 ! 3 Nc3 Ng7 !

We close our discussion with the following exercise: determine the key and corresponding squares in 2.26, 2.29 and in 2.33 before and af- ter 2 b3. Solutions can be found, e.g., in The Fi- nal Countdown (nos. 71, 31-33 and 1 14 - this does not fit exactly, but is very similar to the af- ter 2 b3 case) or in Secrets of Pawn Endings (12.04, 12.08 and A12.ll). General Principles: Pawn Endings These principles should be applied carefully as chess is a concrete game and each situation has its own features. 1) The king is a powerful unit. Activate it! 2) The material advantage of one pawn is often decisive. 3) A protected passed pawn is favourable. 4) An outside passed pawn deflects the op- ponent's king. 5) It is unfavourable to have many isolated pawns and pawn-islands.
PAWN ENDINGS 55
By now you should be familiar with the fol- lowing concepts and expressions: opposition (distant, diagonal, virtual), main file, key squares, passed pawn (outside, protected, connected), square rule, majority, breakthrough, zugzwang, reciprocal zugzwang, corresponding squares, triangulation, encirclement, king-march, fight for tempi, liquidation of one wing. Always remember that in pawn endings, the difference between a win, loss or draw is often just one careless king or pawn move. Be alert! Reference works Encyclopaedia of Chess Endings (ECE), Pawn Endings volume, Belgrade 1982 Bauernendspiele (Av), Averbakh, Sportver- lag Berlin 1988 The Final Countdown, Hajenius and Van Riemsdijk, Cadogan 1997 Secrets of Pawn Endings (SoPE), K. Muller and Lamprecht, Gambit/Everyman 2000. Exercises (Solutions on pages 366-8) We offer a few words of advice before you start. There are many ways to work with exercises. It is probably best to play the positions out with a friend or a computer; take your time over this. Pawn endings are very suitable to train your calculating abilities, so at least try to solve the easier ones (one or two stars) in your head and analyse the others on the board. The method of exclusion (see 2.13A) might help you. Note that the main point of the exercise is not always the first move; there is often a later trick that needs to be detected! Anyway, before you read the solution, you should have reached an opin- ion about the final result and the expected main line. Most importantly, we hope that you find the exercises enjoyable and stimulating.

3 Knight Endings
Before we go into details, we should talk about some of the knight's characteristics. We all know that the knight is somewhat slow. Even on an open board, reaching a particular square from a comer can take up to six moves! Thus, the knight is not especially adept at fighting simul- taneously on both flanks. On the other hand, the knight is tricky. From your earliest chess expe- riences you undoubtedly recall having lost your queen through a knight fork, while the knight often gains unexpected speed thanks to little checks along its way. Its influence ranges from eight squares when standing in the centre to a meagre two squares when in a comer. With ev- ery move, the knight changes its square colour and attacks a new set of squares, but it totally loses its direct influence on all the squares pre- viously attacked: when forced to move, it can't maintain protection of a certain pawn or square. Also, it can't protect a pawn that in turn pro- tects the knight. Finally, the knight is unable to lose a tempo, as it always needs an even number of moves to get from one light square to an- other. Bearing these characteristics in mind, let's start. Our subchapters are:
3.1: Knight vs Pawns 58
3.2: Knight vs Knight 76

White has made no progress and the knight was busy all the time and could not sacrifice it- self for the pawn, so even additional black pawns on g6 and h6 would not change the result. Chdron ascribes this defensive method to Philidor (see Cheron 783). A) Knight vs Pawn This material balance is usually a draw. The knight faces most problems dealing with a rook's pawn, because its mobility is restricted at the edge. If the knight occupies the square directly in front of the pawn, the position is always drawn

The only exception is a rook's pawn on the seventh rank:

You should always remember that the knight can get into severe trouble near the edge of the board: With White to move, Black's king arrives too late: 1 i>b7! <Nc5 2 4>xa8! Nc6 3 <Nb8 +-. If Black is to move, he draws: l...Ne5! 2 <±)b7 Nd6! 3 Bxa8 <4'c7! stalemate. In some positions the knight is able to build a barrier:

If White is to move, he wins with either 1 Nf7 or 1 'i'eS, stepping around the minefield.

C) Knight and Pawn vs King As the knight doesn't have enough horsepower to mate on his own, everything depends on the survival of the last pawn. If the king protects its pawn, there are no problems, since the pawn can advance to the seventh rank, whereupon the knight can, if necessary, make a waiting move to avoid stalemate. The exception is a rook's pawn; then the knight is needed to control the comer square. If the king is far away, the knight has to protect the pawn until its king can come into play. For these cases the following rule is useful: the knight should protect the passed pawn from behind. The diagram on the follow- ing page explains why. Although the knight is attacked, it can't be captured (note: this wouldn't be the case with the knight on c7 or b8) and so there is plenty of time to activate the white king: 1 *b3 *a7

There is just one impor- tant elementary fortress: chance for an honourable resignation has come. Note that with his king on al instead of b4 Black would also win, since the white king needs two moves each time it oscillates between e7 and d5, while the black knight swings to e4 and back to g5 in one move, thus gaining time for its king to approach. With blocked rook's pawns this swing would be impossible. If the pawns are not yet blocked, the drawing chances increase:

A.Alekhine - F.Englund Scheveningen 1913

A.Yermolinsky - N.Short Tallinn/Parnu Keres mem 1998 The king has to work with the c-pawn and the knight must stop the pawns and provide spare tempi. Alekhine starts the task-switching immediately:
1 Ne2 *d7 2 Nd4!
After 2 Ne5+? Ne6 White can't win; e.g., 3 c6 *d6 = or 3 2kl3 h4 4 *f3 Nd5 ! = (4...h3? 5 *e4! h2 6 £rf2 g4 7 £hl +-). White's king has to watch the passed pawns and the knight has to protect the c-pawn, so no progress can be made.

S*e4! After 5 xh4?? Nd5 White's last pawn is lost.

Black is powerless against the advance of White's c-pawn: 8...Nd7 9 c6+ 10 *i>c5 icS 11 Nd6 sfcdS 12 c7+ Nc8 and now the knight acts as a source of a tempo: 13 Nhl +-. If the passed pawns are very far advanced they sometimes secure the draw; e.g., 3.21A G.Hertneck - K.Miiller, Bundesliga 1989/90: w*e4, Ag5, h7; b*e6, Nh8, Ab5: 1 Nd4 *d6 2 *e4 *e6 V2-V2. By the way, the knight can't stop two con- nected passed pawns on their sixth rank unless it can capture one of them immediately. Two passed pawns on the fifth can be stopped; e.g., w*bl, Ag5, h5; b*b3, <Sa5, Ab5: 1...Nc6! 2 g6 Ne7!3g7 Ng8! -+. If the defender has only one passed pawn, he usually loses. The next position is an exception: The knight is too far away from the kingside:
1...*g8!
After l...Nh8? the knight arrives in time: 2 *g6! *g8 3 h7+ *h8 4 Qd3 a2 5 Ne5 ! alQ 6 2>f7#! 2 *g6 *h8! 3 Na2 Ng8 4 Ng5!? <Nh7 5 Nc3 *g8! 6 a2 *h7 7 *h5!? *h8! V2-V2 When the knight is on a2, only the retreat to h8 draws! In 1933, Grigoriev composed a study with the same theme: wsfcg5, Nb4, Ah6; bsfcf7, Aa3; White to play and win, Black to play and draw
(ECE55).
D3) Both Sides Have Several Pawns If all the pawns are on the same wing, the knight usually wins. The next example is fairly typical (see following diagram): Anand managed to win the game as follows: 2 *d2 Be6 3 2>b6 h5 This allows White to make inroads, but Black is lost in any case; e.g., 3...<S?e5 4 Nc4+ Nd4 5 £sd6 *e5 6 2)f7+ <£*f6 7 2)xh6 *g6 8 Nxf5 +- or 3...f4 4 g4 l4'e5 5 £k4+ tffeb 6 sic? sfcdS 7 Nc3 +-. 4 h4!? f4

3.02). A friendly passed pawn is best protected
from behind (see 3.13). The knight has difficul- ties protecting friendly pawns (compare 3.26-
3.28) and is not adept at fighting simultaneously
on both wings (see, e.g., 3.28 and 3.30). White's passed pawns look menacing, but the decisive factor is that his king is out of play: l...Nf6 2 c6 *e7 3 Nb3 (3 c7 2)b6 4 Nb3 *d6

3.2 Knight vs Knight
As we have already seen, mastering the knight is no easy task, but to foresee the intrigues of two knights is even more difficult. Our geomet- rical imagination is probably much better trained to think about rooks and bishops mov- ing along ranks, files and diagonals. In this sub- chapter the reader should be especially alert to some similarities to pawn endings, the ever- present possibilities of knight sacrifices and the fact that small differences in the knights' posi- tions often make all the difference. Still, at least you can't lose your knight due to a knight fork here! We consider the following topics: A: Knight 4- Pawn(s) vs Knight 76 B: Knight + Pawns vs Knight 4- Pawn(s) 79 A) Knight + Pawn(s) vs Knight An escorted pawn on the seventh rank wins (Fine's rule) if there is no immediate draw and it is not a rook's pawn: If the pawn is not so far advanced, the draw- ing chances increase a lot:

3.48
In pawn endings outside passed pawns are very strong and knight endings are similar in that re- spect. Botvinnik even stated the following im- portant 'rule': knight endings are really pawn endings. A knight can't lose a tempo, an outside passed pawn is very favourable as it deflects the defending pieces and with an extra pawn one usually has quite good chances to win. Of course there are differences: the knight can sac- rifice itself and there are tactical possibilities such as knight forks. The following two examples are justly fa- mous: Em.Lasker - A.Nimzowitsch Zurich 1934 Black's h-pawn is a major force, but it is of course much more difficult to convert it into a win than in a pawn ending:

Rules and Principles: Knight vs Knight In summary, we would like to stress the follow- ing points: 1) Botvinnik's principle: knight endings are really pawn endings. The knight is unable to lose a tempo and an extra pawn usually means a lot (see, e.g., 3.47, 3.48 and E3.04). 2) Keep the knight as flexible as possible. If it is stuck on one circuit it can find it extremely difficult to reach certain squares (study 3.46 and 3.53). 3) The side with the advantage sacrifices the minor piece more often than in any other type of ending (compare E3.07, 3.52 and 3.57). 4) Rook's pawns are extremely dangerous since the knight has great difficulties stopping them (see, e.g., 3.02, 3.04, 3.36 and 3.48).

4 Bishop Endings
1 <±>e4! Nh4 2 *f3! +- Due to the terrible position of Black's king, the bishop is unable to reach the gl-a7 diago- nal. By the way, the original study is w e4, Aa4, g4; b*f6, Ng7 (Av 18, ECE 141): 1 a5! Nf8 2 Nd5! Nh6 3 g5+! and after 3...Nxg5 we have reached 4.01. When facing two pawns, the bishop needs the help of its king to achieve the draw. In most cases a simple division of the tasks is sufficient. The bishop stops one pawn (often the more ad- vanced one), while the king takes care of the other one. The following position is critical: The bishop is a long-range piece and can fight on both sides of the board at the same time, but can only visit half of the squares of the board. When it moves, it retains control over one of the diagonals on which it stood; therefore, if the bishop's important tasks all lie on one diagonal, it can fulfil them without falling into zugzwang. Our chapter divides naturally into:

wrong rook's pawn With a light-squared bishop White would give check and queen the pawn. However, the dark-squared bishop can't control the queening square. Thus it's a positional draw as Black's king can't be driven out of the comer: 1 jLc5 Nb8 2 <3?c6 <Na8! (just stay in the corner!) 3 Nb6 Nb8 4 Ad6+ Na8! =. Rule: with the defending king on the queen- ing square, king, bishop and rook 's pawn only win if the bishop controls the corner square. Or shorter: bishop and wrong rook's pawn only draw. This rule is the foundation of the play in many other positions and is therefore of crucial importance. We deal with the resulting prob- lems in various ways throughout the book. The following fortresses are worth remem- bering (diagrams 4.10A-4.10F): Diagram 4.10A: Nothing would be changed if the blocked pawns were the base of a longer pawn-chain; e.g., add white pawns on b5 and c4 and black pawns on b6 and c5. Diagram 4.10C: The pawns could be the base of a longer pawn-chain; e.g., add white pawns on c5 and d4 and black pawns on c6 and d5. Diagram 4.10D: 1 Nc6!? <it?b8! 2 *d7 bxc6! =. The initial position is also drawn with wAa5 and bAa6 added due to 2.31 H. Diagram 4.10F: 1 Nc7 Na7! 2 *c8 *a8! 3 Bb8 b5 4 axb6 stalemate. B) Fortresses As the bishop can only visit half of the squares on the board, it is more likely that the defender can construct a fortress when fighting against a bishop than when facing a knight. We start with a real exception:

4.11 =/=
N.Short - A.Yemiolinsky Wijk aan Zee 1997 It is easy to see that the position is drawn if White's king reaches the hl -comer and stays there. If White's king can't manage to get there it is much more difficult. The area below the line in the above diagram is called 'Rauzer's drawing zone'. Averbakh gave the following guidelines: 1 ) It is not enough for White to be inside the zone - he has to reach the comer in time. 2) With the bishop controlling the a7-gl di- agonal, White has to be able to answer ...<£'g4 with <S?e2. Sometimes it is possible for the defender to leave the zone if he can make sure that he will return to it (see the game after 2O..Bc3). The game went: 1 <Ncl Ne2 2 *c2 Bd2 3 i>b3 *dl 4 *b2 Aa5 5 *b3 *d2 6 *b2 Nc3+ 7 *b3 Ng7 8 Na3 Nc2 9 Na2 If White leaves the drawing zone here then he loses: 9 *a4?

Black loses if he can't get back inside the zone. He has always to be careful not to allow White's bishop to cage him; e.g., wieb, .e7; b&eS and Black to move, which can also happen on h7 or h5. White, on the other hand, has to watch out for ...b4, espe- cially if Black's king is near b5.

R.Dautov - D.Sermek Dresden Z 1998 White has a wrong rook's pawn so care is required. However, the doubled g-pawns allow the following winning plan: 1 ) Pick up the a-pawn. 2) Stalemate Black's king in the h8-comer, which forces ...g5. 3) Stalemate the king again, forcing ...g6. 4) The same procedure ultimately forces the transformation of the rook's pawn into a winning knight's pawn.

BISHOP ENDINGS 107
We now move on to positions where both sides have a bishop. Endings with same- or op- posite-coloured bishops are so different in eval- uation and play that a strict separation is useful. We start with...
4.2 Same-Coloured Bishop
Endings A few thoughts first. As the bishops have the same colour, they often fight for the same squares. The stronger side can usually offer a bishop exchange to gain control over certain diagonals. The fight on the 32 uncontrolled squares is left to the kings and pawns. It is im- portant to know that it can be very difficult to drive a defending king away from an uncon- trolled square, especially if a check with a pawn isn't available and the defending bishop is free, so that zugzwang is unlikely. Let us think about the pawn-structure. There are pros and cons and a general rule could eas- ily be misunderstood, but in most cases your pawn-chains are clearly better placed on the op- posite colour to your bishop. This has the obvi- ous advantage that they can't be attacked by the opponent's bishop and that they restrict the op- ponent's king. You can than protect the 'holes' in between with your bishop or (in closed struc- tures) attack the opponent's pawn-chain your- self. A pawn-chain on your bishop's colour can be protected by your bishop and sometimes se- verely restricts the opponent's bishop in its ac- tions, but there is a big disadvantage. The pawns are open to attack from both the opponent's bishop and king, which can invade through the holes unprotected by the bishop and the pawns. You can then only deny the entrance with your own king, which often leads to zugzwang posi- tions. The topic is discussed as follows, as always starting with the most basic positions: A: Bishop + Pawn(s) vs Bishop 107 B: Pawns on One Wing 110 C: Pawns on Both Wings 111 D: Important Motifs and Resources 1 14

*/ If Black were to move, he would lose at once. Can White make any use of this fact? It looks drawish as White has only one pawn left. What should White do? A) Bishop + Pawn(s) vs Bishop There are two basic defensive resources as the bishop can sacrifice itself for the pawn:
108 FUNDAMENTAL CHESS ENDINGS
1) If the defending king reaches a square in front of the pawn opposite to the bishop's col- our, it is an ironclad draw. 2) If the defender's king gets to the rear of the pawn as in 4.26, he can draw according to Centurini's Rule. We start with the case when the defender tries to get in front of the pawn:

L.Centurini, 1856 lNe7 Blocking the pawn, so Black has time to change the bishop's diagonal. This is why Black's control of f6 is so important - if White were able to play Bf6 then he would win.
1...Ne3 2 Af6 Nc5! =
Centurini's Rule: if the passed pawn has advanced beyond the line, the attacker is win- ning as one of the diagonals is shorter than four squares and therefore not long enough to avoid a zugzwang position. There are two exceptions to this rule, both given by Centurini in 1856: w&e8, .h6, Af7; b&e6, Bd6 and w gS, Be3, Ah7; b gb, Be5 are drawn whoever moves first (Av 169, Av 167). If the edge is near, the attacker has problems winning (see, e.g., Centurini's position 0.01). Halberstadt illustrated the fight of the kings to reach the opposition as in 4.26 with the fol- lowing masterpiece (see next diagram): l*e4!! 1 *db? *d3 2 *c7 Nc4 3 *c8 *d5 4 Ng5 Jla5 ! 5 Jlf4 <3?cb! = draws by Centurini's Rule.

i.f5 V2-V2 If the defending king can't get in front of the pawn, the other principal method of defence is to go to the rear of the pawn. We deal with dark-squared bishops but Centurini's Rule is valid analogously for light-squared bishops. The next position illustrates Centurini's Rule with the kings in vertical opposition. The black king controls the important f6-square and Black can't fall into zugzwang as both the diagonals from e7 are long enough (at least four squares).

110 FUNDAMENTAL CHESS ENDINGS
We should note two exceptions to the rule that two connected passed pawns win. The first shows a nice bishop-hunt: B) Pawns on One Wing With pawns only on one wing the drawish ten- dency is very high as it is very difficult to dis- lodge a defending king from a square opposite to the bishop's colour. Therefore, most posi- tions with two pawns vs one pawn and three pawns vs two pawns are drawn. Even with four vs three, a draw is a very likely outcome:

Therefore, White can't make real progress: 1 *b2 Nf4 2 *a3 Ng5 3 *a4 Nd8! 4 b5 Nc7 = This diagram is an example of the following general rule for bishop endings: connected passed pawns should be on squares opposite to your bishop 's colour to avoid a blockade.

In both cases the attacker uses his bishop to bring about a decisive zugzwang situation. In the following diagram, Black has a lot of weak pawns on light squares and d4 must be constantly guarded by the black king. Py tel's bishop manoeuvres are very instructive and should be studied in detail:

4.41 or solve E4.02).
3) As defender, watch out for blockading squares for your king (4.28B and 4.40) and don't let your opponent penetrate as in 4.31-4.34. 4) A two-pawn advantage is in most cases decisive, but one extra pawn might not be suffi- cient, especially if all the pawns are on one wing and there are no further weaknesses. 5) Subtle bishop manoeuvres may be needed to win once you have fixed your opponent's pawns on the right colour (4.31-4.33 again). Study the important motifs and resources carefully!

4.3 Opposite-Coloured
Bishop Endings Opposite-coloured bishop endings are totally different from same-coloured bishop endings, so before we start, some general thoughts are very useful. First, endgame theory suggests that this type of ending is rather drawish and our da- tabase statistics underline this. Most positions with equal material are clear draws and even positions with two extra pawns might offer no chance to play for a win at all. The reason for this is the big influence both sides have on the squares their bishop moves on, which very of- ten allows a blockade. Therefore the fortress theme is always of crucial importance. This leads to general advice that is somewhat differ- ent from that stated earlier for same-coloured bishops: Rule 1: the defender should place his pawns on his own bishop 's colour and force the at- tacker's pawns to the opposite colour. Rule 2: the attacker should, as always, place his pawns on the opposite colour to his own bishop. By following this Rule 1, the defender can easily protect the pawns with his bishop, unhin- dered by the opponent's pawns. The second rule is especially important to prevent a block- ade of connected passed pawns. Also, the prin- ciple of one diagonal is again very important, since the opponent can't challenge our bishop with his counterpart. Finally, we will learn that positional considerations, especially dangerous passed pawns, often outweigh material deficits. Therefore, we should bear in mind the possibil- ity of breakthroughs by the attacker or freeing pawn sacrifices by the defender. In this section we discuss the following top- ics: A: Bishop + Pawns vs Bishop 118 B: Fortresses 121 C: Siege Techniques 123 A) Bishop + Pawns vs Bishop The defender's drawing chances increase dra- matically with opposite-coloured bishops. With only one pawn it is essentially trivial: if the bishop can permanently guard one square in front of the pawn it is an ironclad draw. If the passed pawn is very far advanced, a fight similar

The win with Black's king on c7 and the bishop on e7 was shown by Salvioli back in 1887 (ECE 1340): White's king easily pushes the f-pawn to f7 and then the king marches to g8. It is this ability to penetrate from both sides with the king that means that the two bishop's pawns win - if they can't be stopped on one and the same diagonal of course: w4>e4, Bd7, Ac6, f3; b'A'gS, $Lc7 is drawn whoever moves first (Averbakh 1950, ECE 1342).

In most cases the weaker side tries to put all his pawns on the same col- our as his bishop and to use his king to block enemy passed pawns. It is also possible for the bishop to stop the passed pawns, while the king keeps its enemy counterpart out. In this case the principle of one diagonal is usually crucially important for the defender in order to avoid zug- zwang or deflection of the bishop. If this strat- egy succeeds, then usually nothing can be done.

Dvoretsky gives two possibilities to hold on much more easily: 3 Bh6 g5 4 = and 3 d5 Axd5 4 Bd4 =. In both variations the bishop alone hinders Black's efforts to create a passed pawn on the kingside and White's king is free to stop advances on the queenside.

In sharp contrast to other endings, material con- siderations often play a minor role compared to positional factors. The main weapons are zug- zwang, the creation of two passed pawns on dif- ferent wings and breaking through with the king to support a passed pawn or attack the en- emy pawns. The principle of one diagonal is very important again - for both the attacker and the defender, as we will see. We will start with zugzwang: 1 *b4 2 *c3 *d6 3 *d3 £cl?

124 FUNDAMENTAL CHESS ENDINGS
Some twenty moves ago this ending had been a simple draw. Black could have had his king on either e7 or g7 (with the white king on h5) with a typical fortress. Maybe it was Black's careless play or my own (Frank Lamprecht) long fight some boards away which motivated my friend and team-mate Georg von Bulow to make some more 'fruitless' moves. The result was aston- ishing and the reward (beer) afterwards well deserved. After the typical breakthrough to cre- ate a passed pawn, Black's seemingly active king will soon become his main problem: 1 g5! fxg5 l...hxg5? 2 h5 +- .

Rules and Principles: Opposite-Coloured Bishops 1) Most of the time, material is not as im- portant as positional considerations (4.59). 2) The defender's aim is to construct an im- pregnable fortress of one of the following types: Type 1: the king stops the passed pawn while the bishop protects the other pawns (see 4.49A and B). Type 2: the bishop stops the passed pawns while the king assists it and stops the attacking king breaking through (see 4.49E). 3) If a fortress of the second type can be broken, then the attacker usually creates two passed pawns on different wings and his king helps one pawn to advance, eventually winning the bishop (compare, e.g., 4.53 and 4.58). 4) If the attacker sacrifices material himself to create passed pawns, his bishop must be able to halt the resulting enemy passed pawns on one diagonal. The principle of one diagonal is important for the attacker and the defender as a method to avoid falling into zugzwang or being diverted (see 4.46). 5) As defender, attack your opponent's pawns with your bishop to force them onto squares of the opposite colour to your bishop. It is then easier to create a safe blockade.

5 Bishop vs Knight
The question of whether a bishop is stronger than a knight is very old. Although the two pieces move in completely different ways, their value seems to be almost equal on an 8 x 8 board. However, each piece has its advantages and disadvantages. The bishop tends to be better when the posi- tion is open and there is play on both wings. It is also much more difficult to put the side with a bishop in zugzwang as it can usually lose a tempo much more easily than a knight. On the other hand, the bishop's main weakness is of course that it can only visit half of the squares on the board. Therefore, if a firm blockade can be created on squares of the other colour, this is usually the end of the matter. Also, if a lot of pawns are blocked on squares of the bishop's colour, its possibilities can be very restricted and in extreme cases it can even start to look like an overgrown pawn. We have divided the material in this chapter into positions favourable for either the bishop or the knight, and conclude with a brief section on situations with more minor pieces: because the knight can easily fall into zug- zwang:

John Nunn deals with the subject of bishop + pawn vs knight much more extensively in his book Secrets of Minor-Piece Endings (pp. 206-64). With two connected passed pawns, there are two different cases. If the knight has managed to set up a blockade on squares opposite to the bishop's colour, the position is drawn (see fol- lowing diagram). King and bishop can't take all seven squares away from Black's knight: 1 *g4 Nd3 2 <±f3 Qf4 Not, of course, 2...<4>f6?? 3 Ne3 4hb4 (or

In the following example the extra pawn is not so easy to convert into victory, since Black almost has a fortress: C) Fortresses As with opposite-coloured bishops, fortresses are possible for the knight, especially if the pawns are blocked on squares of opposite col- our to the bishop. In most cases it is important that the king has no entry route and that the for- tress can't be destroyed by zugzwang (remem- ber that it is more likely that a knight will fall into zugzwang than a bishop). The classic ex- ample is the following:

The next game will most probably not be- come a classic (see following diagram). All Black's pieces are on light squares, but the knight is very restricted.

Now: a) 5 &d 1? b3 = completes Black's fortress. There is absolutely no way out for White's king and Black doesn't fall into zugzwang because the knight has the squares f8, f6 and g5 and the king d2, d3 and e3. White can't deprive him of them all.

Even the following position, which was analysed deeply by Yusupov in Technique for the Tournament Player, is won: With all the pawns on one wing, the knight is the stronger piece:

White's pieces are excellently placed and he can play against the h5-pawn, but on the other hand Black's position is quite solid and his pawns are on squares of opposite colour to the bishop, thus complementing it. So it is no won- der that the evaluation of the position differs: Beliavsky and Mikhalchishin in Winning End- game Technique and Serper (ECE 1051) claim that White wins, while Lutz cast doubt on this in his book Endgame Secrets. 1 €te4 i.b6 2 f5!? gxfS

However, the presence of many pawns doesn't automatically favour the knight. It is especially important that many pawns are blocked on the bishop's colour and that the bishop can't become active, i.e. that that it has no real targets. The following posi- tion is typical (see next diagram). The protected passed pawn on e5 is in fact a disadvantage, because the blockading e4-knight is so powerful. This situation is typical of a King's Indian gone wrong for Black. 1 g5! Creating an entry road for the king.

BISHOP VS KNIGHT 153
The next three examples are very famous. In the 1984/5 World Championship Karpov found a very surprising refutation of a normal-looking capture by Kasparov: So strangely enough, the same theme arose twice in this game: first the missing pawn on h4 opened a route for the white king to gain a win- ning position, and now the missing pawn on d5 should give Black sufficient counterplay to draw!

Knight vs Bishop: a brief summary The bishop is a long-range piece and likes play on both wings and open positions. Its main dis- advantage is that it can only visit half the squares on the board. The side with the bishop should therefore generally place his pawns on the opposite colour squares. When fighting against a knight, the bishop can use zugzwang and the corralling motif (5.02). The knight can visit every square of the board and so in inferior positions the player with the knight can try to construct a fortress on squares opposite to the bishop's colour. How- ever, the player has to be careful not to fall into zugzwang. The knight is a short-range piece and likes play on one wing. If in closed posi- tions many enemy pawns are blocked on the same colour as the bishop, the knight can, to- gether with its king, use the weak colour com- plex to infiltrate the enemy position. In some favourable positions it might be useful to place mobile pawn-chains on the enemy bishop's col- our, so as to restrict its movement. In unfavour- able positions this is unlikely to be correct, as these pawn-chains can be attacked. Articles by Timman in New in Chess Maga- zine 8/96 and 1/97 Exercises (Solutions on pages 375-6) White's far-advanced f-pawn should give him an easy win, don't you think?

" ss 5.3 The Bishop-Pair Two bishops are in most cases better than other combinations of minor pieces, since the main disadvantage of the bishop, its inability to con- trol squares of a particular colour, is nullified by the presence of the other one.

6 Rook Endings
You should study rook endings extremely care- fully as they occur very frequently in practice. The rook is a powerful long-range piece and should generally be used actively. The rook is not adept in passive defence and the blockade of enemy passed pawns. For this reason, the game may still be unclear even when one side has to sacrifice his rook, which leads us to the first of the three topics of this chapter, which are:
6.1: Rook vs Pawns
6.2: Rook vs Rook
6.3: Double-Rook Endings

6.1 Rook vs Pawns cutting off
2...C2 3 Hc3 +-
'Cutting off' is a very important fighting method in various rook endings. The last chance for the cutting-off idea is on the rook's 5th rank; if the pawn is further advanced it doesn't work. If we move all the pieces a rank down the board, then you will see that Black could simply advance his pawn without losing it. Note that the initial position is also won with the pawn still on c5: The statistics show that this type of ending oc- curs less often than the similar cases with a mi- nor piece, but due to its special importance in rook endings with passed pawns, a careful study of the themes and motifs is called for. Our topics are: A: Rook vs One Pawn 161 B: Rook vs Two Pawns 164 C: Rook vs Three Pawns 169 D: Rook and Pawns vs Pawns 172 A) Rook vs One Pawn
6.01A
The rook's winning chances depend very much on how close the attacking king is. Sometimes it is winning even when it is very far away (see following diagram): IflgS! The rook cuts off Black's king, which is now unable to support the pawn. Black now has a choice between losing his pawn or allowing the white king to approach, with fatal consequences in either case.

Rules and Principles: Rook vs Pawns The following rules and motifs are very impor- tant: • Cutting the king off (6.01 ) • Shouldering away (6.03 and 6.04) • Intermediate rook check to avoid the body- check (6.06) • Underpromotion to a knight (6.02) Also remember that when fighting against two connected pawns, the best position for the rook is usually behind the more advanced pawn (6.12).

6.2 Rook vs Rook W/B
This subchapter on endings with rook 4- pawn(s) vs rook (+ pawns) is by far the largest of the whole book, since rook endings occur very fre- quently in practice. One possible explanation for this is that it usually takes a long time for the rooks to enter the game, since they start in the comers, and can only really become active once there are some open files. Therefore it is very likely that two of them will remain until the end- game. You should study this section carefully and you should know the basic positions, espe- cially the Philidor and Lucena positions, by heart. We divide the material as follows: A: Rook and Pawn(s) vs Rook 177 633 +/= Philidor position, 1777 l.JZb6(!) In fact any rook move on the b-file (except for l...Bb5? and L..Hb7??) draws, but L..Hb6

Alb) The Defending King is Cut Off Along a File If the defending king can't get in front of the pawn, and the attacker can't directly reach a Lucena Position, matters become much more complicated. In this section we consider the case where the king is cut off along a file, while the next section deals with positions where it is cut off along a rank. Note that these two sec- tions only cover centre, bishop's and knight's pawns; in these three cases there are plenty of thematic similarities in the play, though some important differences too. Totally different prin- ciples apply to rook's pawns, which are there- fore discussed separately, in section Aid. Two points are worth noting to start with: 1) The rook defends best from in front, so that the attacking king can 't use its pawn as a shield.

With Black's king perfectly placed, White can't win as the checking distance of Black's rook is large enough:

Aid) Rook's Pawn In rook endings a pawn at the edge is usually weaker than other pawns. There are two rea- sons for this: 1) Whilst a rook's pawn may protect the king against vertical checks, it offers no protection against checks from the side. 2) The attacking king can easily get caged in front of the pawn, making its promotion im- possible. We consider the following situations: Aldi: King in Front of its Pawn 187 Ald2: Rook in Front of its Pawn 188 Ald3: Other Situations 189 6.54

The rook has to be on the same rank as White's pawn, since this forces White's rook to stay on the a-file. With the rook on the f-file, there is also the chance to give a defensive rook check on f7 if necessary. Thus with Black's rook on g6 or h6 White (to move) would win with (4 >b5-b6-b7 and Bc8. Black's king is happy on g7 since an advance of the pawn to a7 could be met by shifting the rook to the a-file (White has no Bh8 tricks). Note that a set-up with the black king on h7 and the rook on g6 is equally successful. I*b5 White protects the pawn and threatens to win by Bc8.

If the defender can't get his king in front of the pawns, the attacker can often win by shuf- fling his pawns forward in unison with the rook, even if his own king is cut off from the action.

/*** Can you find a way for Black to win? A2) Rook and Two Pawns vs Rook Our topics are: A2a: Connected Pawns 192 A2b: Isolated Pawns 196 A2c: Two Rooks' Pawns 200 A2d: Rook's and Bishop's Pawns 201 A2e: Doubled Pawns 204 A2a) Connected Pawns Naturally, two connected extra pawns are gen- erally sufficient to win. However, there are quite a few exceptions and it is often easy to go astray, especially when a rook's pawn comes into play. Therefore nearly all of our positions are with g- and h-pawns. The first example shows the way to win:

J.van der Wiel - P.Boersma Dutch Ch (Hilversum) 1986 Such positions were analysed in great detail by Kasparian some fifty years ago. He called them "triangular positions" in view of White's piece configuration. The rook is tied to the de- fence of the b-pawn, while the white king can't help. Thus Van der Wiel's winning attempts are easily parried:

...and Kasparov soon won. The familiar shouldering-off motif also ap- plies here: Can White (to move) survive? C) Pawn Races While there are winning chances if the attacker has more dangerous passed pawns or if the de- fending king is passively placed, the drawish tendency of rook endings is also seen when it comes to races, since the defending rook can sacrifice itself for the passed pawn. In the following diagram, despite Black's obvious advantages Korchnoi could still have saved himself:

ROOK ENDINGS 223
D) One Side Has a Passed Pawn In most other types of ending, an extra outside passed pawn would be a decisive advantage but the rook is such a strong counterattacking unit that it may not be possible to convert the mate- rial advantage into victory. In practice, these endings are particularly important since they often arise after one side manages to win a pawn in the middlegame, and the opponent seeks drawing chances by exchanging pawns and heading for a rook ending.

Fine gave some guidelines in Basic Chess Endings: If the defender's king is on the side where the pawns are balanced then the following plan should be adapted: 1 ) Place the king and rook on the best possi- ble squares: 2) Advance the pawns on the other wing as far as convenient, without actually setting up a passed pawn; 3) Reach a won ending with an outside passed pawn. Thus, creating an outside passed pawn as quickly as possible is sometimes not the right plan as some positions are drawn. It is better to manoeuvre first and to try to create a passed pawn under favourable circumstances. If the defender's king is on the side with the potential passed pawn, then the decisive manoeuvre is the penetration of the attacking king on the op- posite wing. Nunn used the following example in Secrets of Practical Chess to illustrate the procedure (see next diagram). The black king is ready to halt the majority so we are in the second of the cases mentioned above. According to the rule it is systematic now to transfer the king to the queenside and to try to create inroads there. However, at the mo- ment there are no avenues and so Nunn decides to gain space on the kingside first:
1 h4 b5
Fritz immediately gains space, but opens pathways for White's pieces at the same time.
2 g4 a5 3 Ng3 a4
With the idea ...b4 and ...Sdl to attack the pawns, so Nunn puts a stop to that:

Now Nunn follows Fine's guideline and tries to penetrate on the queenside with his king. However, the immediate 9 Se5 is better: 9...c6 K)3c5 Sd2(10...3d6 11 c4 bxc4 12Bxc43d2

force all on their own, some differences come into play (our treatment is based in part upon that by Emms in The Survival Guide to Rook Endings)'. 1 ) A small material advantage can more of- ten prove decisive than in a single-rook end- game. One of the reasons is that the extra pawn may provide shelter for the king. 2) Lone pawns are more vulnerable to attack due to the increased firepower on the board. 3) Most importantly, the safety of the kings plays a more crucial role as mating attacks and perpetual check become themes. The increased value of the 7th rank is of great relevance. Thus our material divides into the following topics: Black can't make much progress without los- ing his extra pawn; e.g., 6...2al (6...2f4 7 Hg6 =) 7 Ng4 a3 8 <Nxg5 a2 9 Nh5 =. Rules and Principles: Rook Endings We conclude the very large section on pure rook endings with some remarks and principles: 1) Study Philidor's (6.33) and Lucena's po- sition (6.35) very carefully! They occur quite often in practice. 2) Make yourself familiar with the checking distance (see, e.g., 6.43). 3) Tarrasch's aphorism "All rook endings are drawn" is not really a rule, but it contains a great deal of truth as a drawish tendency is in- herent in many rook endings. So be careful when you exchange your last rook in an inferior posi- tion! 4) Play actively! It might even be justified to sacrifice a pawn in order to activate the rook or the king (see, e.g., 6.161). 5) The rook is a bad blockader. It is better placed behind a passed pawn (regardless of whether the pawn is friendly or not).

Note that with Black's pawn still on g7, he would have had ...2xg2 as a defence against 2ee7. This kind of defence is acceptable be- cause on g2 the rook remains active. If the king supports the attack, the rooks can often weave a mating-net: b) l...h5!? is better as White's king can't join the attack so easily. White is nevertheless winning; e.g., 2 2h74- £?g8 3 2dg74- f8 4 2xg6 2xa2 5 2g5 2d8 6 2gxh5 2ad2 7 2a7 4-. 2 2xh7+ *g8 3 £?g4! g5 Now the h-pawn can assist the rooks, but Black has no good defence anyway: a) 3...He8 4 2hg7+ *h8 (4...*f8 5 2df7#) 5 £?g5 2e6 6 £?h6 g54- 7 2g6 4~. b) 3...2f2 4 2dg7+Nf8 5*g5 2d8 6<Nxg6 *e8 7 2e7+ *f8 8 2xe5 £?g8 9 2eh5 +-. 4h5 1-0 Black resigned due to 4...2h2 (4...2f2 5 h6 2f6 6 2dg74- *f8 7 2h8#) 5 2dg74- *f8 6 2xg5 2d8 7 2h8+ Ne7 8 2g74- *f6 9 2hh7 4~.

7 Rook vs Minor Piece(s)
One of the great topics of debate in chess is how much the advantage of an exchange is worth. In certain types of middlegame positions, it can be no advantage at all, but in most endgame situa- tions there are enough open files for the rook to overpower a minor piece unless there are com- pensating factors, such as one or more healthy extra pawns for the side with the minor piece. Of course, a rook still struggles against bishop and knight unless it is supported by some useful extra pawns, or can make good use of its long-range abilities or a lack of coordination between the two minor pieces. This chapter is divided into the following

7.1 Rook vs Knight
Rook and knight move in completely different ways. The rook is a long-range piece, which is usually very strong when there is play on both wings. It is worth approximately a knight and two pawns. When the play is only on one wing, the knight, as a short-range piece, has better chances to organize a defence. Our subjects are: A: Rook (+ Pawns) vs Knight 256 B: Knight 4- Pawns vs Rook 259 C: Rook + Pawn vs Knight 4- Pawn 260 D: Several Pawns on One Wing 264 E: Pawns on Both Wings 268 A) Rook (+ Pawns) vs Knight The lone rook usually can't win against a knight. However, there is considerable danger for the defender when the knight can be separated from the king, or when the king is near a comer. The general outcome is nevertheless a draw (see following diagram). Although the king seems to be in great dan- ger, White's attack doesn't crash through:

Ng6 2g8 39 Exg7 2Bf6 40 Ea7 2g8 41 Eh7# (1-0) With three pawns for each side, it is no dif- ferent: If the knight has an extra pawn, there are good drawing chances if a fortress can be created. It is especially important that the knight should have an outpost or that it is on a good circuit, able to defend its own pawns and to attack the opponent's if appropriate. Leykin demonstrates that it is possible to hold the following position by using this technique (see Averbakh):

ROOK VS MINOR PlECE(S) 269
2) With pawns only on one wing, the player with the knight can sometimes construct a for- tress, but he has to be careful not to fall into zugzwang, which is, as we already know, a typ- ical fighting method against a knight. 3) The rook is very strong with pawns on both wings, especially if it can create and sup- port a passed pawn (see 7.24 and 7.25).

Rook and bishop are both long-range pieces but the rook is nevertheless much stronger as it can visit all the squares on the board and it can cut off the enemy king all on its own.

**/ A) Rook (+ Pawns) vs Bishop A Ione rook normally cannot win against a bishop, especially if the defending king is in a comer opposite to the bishop's colour (see fol- lowing diagram). At first sight it looks dangerous for Black but stalemate saves him in all variations: How can Black's c-pawn be stopped?

Rook and pawn usually win against a bishop, but it is worth noting that the king and rook should be activated before the pawn advances too far. In most cases the position remains won, but there are some exceptions, especially with a rook's pawn and a queening square of the oppo- site colour to the bishop. The following diagram shows the standard winning technique: iScl 1 d5+?! preserves the win but slows the pro- cess down considerably, since White's king finds it more difficult to approach (see 7.28A).

£ )b7! +-. With pawns on a5 and a6 (i.e. the attacker's pawn on its fifth rank) and a light-squared bishop, the method applied by Gallagher would lead to success. The situation with the attacker's pawn block- aded further back (on its third rank or on its ini- tial square) is extremely difficult. Again it is crucially important whether the defending king can be confined to the right areas of the board. With rooks' pawns, matters are much more delicate as the simplification into a pawn end- ing only works when the defending king is cut off far away. In the next example it is even wrong to drive the defending king away from its pawn. The correct method is to bring about a decisive zugzwang situation:

If the defender has a knight's pawn against a bishop's pawn, he can't hide from the rook checks and so the following position is lost, but White's king has to make a very long march to prove this: When there are passed pawns, the rook has even better chances to show its superiority.

R.Kholmov, 1973 Kholmov did the groundbreaking work in this position (see Av 481). Speelman in End- game Preparation and Hubner in 25 Annotated Games also analysed it in great detail. Speel- man provides some valuable insights regarding positions where the attacker's pieces are not yet placed optimally, while Hubner gives a good overview and corrects several minor errors by earlier analysts. We provide a less detailed cov- erage but hope the following analysis proves that Black wins, and reveals the main steps to achieve this.

Rules and Principles: Rook vs Bishop 1 ) The pawnless ending king + rook vs king + bishop is drawn. The defender's king must head for a comer opposite to the bishop's colour. 2) With pawns on one wing, the fortresses
7.49 and 7.50 are worth knowing as they occur
quite often in practice. 3) Study 7.54-7.58 in detail as the examples show how the attacker can (or can't) storm for- tresses. 4) In 7.65 Alekhine demonstrates how to create and play on a weak colour complex op- posite to the bishop's colour.

8 Rook and Minor Piece vs
Rook (and Minor Piece) This chapter is divided into two main parts. First we discuss the pawnless endings rook + knight vs rook, and rook + bishop vs rook. Sooner or later you are very likely to face one of these endings over the board and especially in the second case it is very important to memo- rize the defensive techniques as the ending is extremely difficult to defend without knowing them. These sections are rounded off with a few positions with added pawns, and as expected the extra piece scores heavily (statistically more than 70% wins and about 19% draws). The ending rook 4- minor piece vs rook + mi- nor piece occurs extremely frequently in prac- tice. In the framework of this book it would be impractical to include hundreds of examples, so we have concentrated on a few instructive ones, with the emphasis on plans, themes and motifs. While these are sufficient for an over- view, you might be interested in taking a look at one of the reference works that are mentioned at the end of this chapter. The subchapters are therefore:

8.1 Rook and Knight vs
Rook The pawnless ending has a much greater draw- ish tendency than rook and bishop vs rook. In many games the draw was immediately agreed until Kasparov created some upset by defeating Judit Polgar in 1996 (see 8.03). In our view, this ending is worth playing on if the defending king is confined near the edge. Indeed, if it should happen to be in the comer, the winning chances are high:

The Cochrane Defence works well on the cen- tral files. On the b- and g-files it requires great care because of the proximity of the comer, and on the a-file it does not work at all (w&a5, Ba4, 2h7; b&a8, 2a2: 1 Nb6! 2b2+ 2 Nb5! +-). The Second-Rank Defence This is the main alternative defensive method. For a long time it was relatively unknown, but it was recently vindicated by the database.
8.2 Rook and Bishop vs
Rook The pawnless ending occurs relatively often in practice. It is generally drawn, but there are some positions that require more than 50 moves to win. This caused FIDE to expand the 50- move rule and to give the attacker 75 moves. Naturally, this increased the number of decisive games even more, but only because it gave the attacker more time to probe for an error. Al- though this decision was reversed, it is still very important to study the main defensive strategies: the venerable Cochrane Defence and the more recently discovered Second-Rank Defence. The Cochrane Defence

If the defender has one additional pawn it can often be won, but there are exceptions, e.g., L.van Wely-Z.Almasi, Polanica Zdroj Rubin- stein mem 2000 saw White try unsuccessfully to win Black's last pawn in the position w ?f2, Sa6, Jlc7; b'S?f5, Sd5, Ag5.

304 FUNDAMENTAL CHESS ENDINGS
8.3 Rook and Minor Piece
vs Rook and Minor Piece More than 15% of all games (based on Mega Database 2001; see the statistics on pages 1 1- 12) reach an ending of rook 4- minor piece vs rook + minor piece, so you might expect to get it about once or twice in every longer tourna- ment! Naturally there are four different piece configurations to investigate (with relative per- centage frequencies in brackets): 1) 2 + N vs 2 + & (20.4%). 2) 2 + & vs 2 + 1 with same-coloured bishops (22.2%). 3) 2 + JL vs 2 + JL with opposite-coloured bishops (12.7%). 4) 2 + £ vs 2 + ft (44.7%). Basically, we have a minor-piece ending with the additional firepower of the rook. For- tunately, the principles from the minor-piece chapters can in general also be applied to the above piece arrangements. However, there are some very important new facets. Of course it is still highly important to acti- vate your king, but two pieces can in connec- tion with certain pawn-structures (or their king) create mating threats or at least cause a lot of trouble. The combination of rook and bishop is especially dangerous in this respect (see for ex- ample 8.21, 8.22 or E8.08). The drawbacks of the minor pieces are some- what compensated by the rook, which attacks squares denied to the bishop, or saves time for the slower knight. Especially for the knight, a safe anchor square is important, since other- wise it is constantly exposed to possible attacks from the rook. This also applies to the bishop if it has duties on both flanks. Finally, be prepared for simplifications and don't forget about a pos- sible exchange sacrifice. We consider the topics as follows: A) Rook and Knight vs Rook and Knight With knights, matters are usually very tactical since rook and knight working together repre- sent a considerable attacking force. In the fol- lowing example, the king joins in as well: J.Emms - K.Miiller Bundesliga 2000/1 The position is almost symmetrical, but Black is nevertheless on the brink of disaster as White's rook is much more active. Therefore, I decided to activate my rook at the cost of two pawns to obtain counterplay:
1...2.6
After L..2c8 I didn't like 2 g4. 2 ftd3 2b6 3 2xd5 2b3 4 fte5! 2b2+ 5 &el fte3 6 2xa5 I was worried about 6 ftxg6+ fxg6 7 2e5+ Nd6 8 2xe3, when it is not completely clear if Black can save the draw.
6...ftf5 7 2a7+?
This allows Black's king to play a very active role. 7 d5! was John Emms's proposal. It seems to be very strong; e.g., 7...2g2 8 ftc4 2xg3 9 2a7+ *f6 10 d6 2xf3 1 1 d7 Ne7 12 ftb6 2d3 13a5+-

Dorfman's suggestion 8...ftxd4 is also inter- esting; e.g., 9 ftg5+ Nd5 10 a5 Nc4 1 1 a6 2a2 12 2c7+ Nd3 13 a7 ftc2+ and White's king A: Rook and Knight vs Rook and Knight 304 B: Same-Coloured Bishops with One Pair of Rooks 307 C: Opposite-Coloured Bishops with One Pair of Rooks 308 D: Rook and Bishop vs Rook and Knight 309 Case D is especially interesting, and has some- times been dubbed the 'Fischer Endgame' in view of a number of instructive wins by Fischer.

R.Akesson - E.Gausel Munkebo Z 1998 Compare the piece positions: White's knight blocks Black's queenside majority and ties the rook down to the defence of b7. The rook is also well placed on the only open file, so that Black's knight has to protect the entry square e8. Never- theless, Black has a regrouping plan involving the moves ,.JZc7, ...sfcgS-fZ and ...<2kl7. White counters this by bringing his king and pawn- majority into play:

For another example see 11.10, V.Kramnik- C.Lutz. B) Same-Coloured Bishops with One Pair of Rooks Rook and bishop usually form a powerful duo if they get attacking chances in an open or semi- open position, which tends to favour the attack- ing or more active side. The king usually tries to join their attack on squares opposite to the bishop's colour. The following classic also shows that the defender's rook is a strong coun- terattacking unit:

R.Fischer - Ja.Bolbochan Mar del Plata 1959 White is slightly better as his king is more active and his bishop has a fine base on f3, pro- tecting the weak square e2 and controlling the long diagonal. Nevertheless, with careful de- fence, the position is still drawn:

9 Queen Endings
Queen endings are different from the endings we have discussed so far since the presence of such a powerful piece as the queen adds new di- mensions to the play, with king safety in partic- ular being a higher priority. This makes matters more complicated at first sight, but on closer in- spection it is not such a difficult topic since the number of basic techniques to apply (see 'Rules and Principles' at the end of this chapter on page 328) is quite small. Our discussion is divided into the following sections:
9.1: Queen vs Pawn(s) 313
9.2: Queen vs Queen 315
9.1 Queen vs Pawn(s)
At first the queen has to approach.
1...Nc2 2Wa4+ *d2
2...*d3 is met by 3 Rb4 followed by Wei . If
the queen manages to get in front of the pawn, the win is trivial.
3 Rd4+ Nc2 4 Re3! £dl 5 Rd3+!
The decisive moment. White forces the black king in front of the pawn, so that he can bring his own king closer.
5...*el 6 Nb7 *f2 7 Rd4+ 8 Rf4+

However, the position would have been drawn with the king on d5, d6 or d7, because the white queen would be obstructed. The same winning procedure works against a knight's pawn. With a rook's or bishop's pawn, there are dif- ficulties because of possible stalemate defences. The queen normally wins against one or even several pawns. Only if the pawns are very far advanced do they have a chance. We start with a single pawn. If it has advanced to the seventh rank and is threatening to pro- mote, everything depends on whether the at- tacking king can assist the queen. With a central pawn, this is almost always possible, no matter how far away the king is.

Not, however, 6...&bl? 7 <Bb4 clQ 8 Nb3! +-. The zone is based on the logic that White wins only if his king can reach b3 or d2 in one move. If Black's king is on the other side of the c-pawn, the winning zone is much larger. This is because White can win a tempo when Black's king blocks the c-pawn and because there exist additional mating patterns on the other side of the pawn (see following diagram).

defending king doesn't manage to get in front of the pawn he usually faces unpleasant prob- lems. We discuss the following important topics: B 1 : Drawing Zones 316 B2: Exchange of Queens, Stalemate and Underpromotion 320 Bl) Drawing Zones The position of the defending king is especially important. Ideally, it should be placed so that its queen can give checks or pin the pawn without being obstructed. With a rook's or a knight's pawn, the theoretical result is a draw if the de- fending king is in front of or near the pawn or if it is in the comer which is furthest away. How- ever, it should be stressed that the practical win- ning chances are much greater with a knight's pawn (especially if it is far advanced) because it provides better shelter for the attacking king than a rook's pawn. With a bishop's pawn or a central pawn, the theoretical result is a win if the defending king is not in front of the pawn. With a bishop's pawn the winning chances are especially great, as we shall see. Our treatment is inspired by John Nunn's exposition in Secrets of Practical Chess (pp. 147-52) and we start with the rook's pawn:

However, we can certainly state that if the

W + a7-pawn vs W The drawing zone has reduced considerably. As a guideline the king should be near the pawn, on the a-file or in the south-east comer. Note that h8 is a draw for specific tactical reasons, and does not constitute a drawing zone in the normal sense. The position w&a5, Rb6, Aa6; b hS, Wcl is lost even if Black moves first (with White to move, 1 a7? would throw the win away!). But it is of course worth knowing that if you are stuck near the north-east comer, h8 is the square to head for. The next example illustrates this (see note 'b' to Black's 1st move), and the winning procedure if the defending king is stuck in the wrong comer:

Rules and Principles: Queen Endings 1) A rook's or a bishop's pawn on the sev- enth rank draws against a queen if the attacking king is outside the winning zone. 2) In an endgame queen 4- rook's or knight's pawn vs queen, the defending king should be near the pawn or in the comer furthest away (e.g., against a pawn on a4 or b4 Black's king should be on the queenside in front of the pawn or in the south-east comer; compare 9.10 and
9.13).
3) Using enemy pawns as shields and 'Head for the Hills' are strategies worth remembering. 4) It is generally favourable to advance a passed pawn, but watch out for possibilities to improve the position of your pieces first. In par- ticular, a centralized queen can be extremely strong. 5) A well-supported far-advanced passed pawn can outweigh several pawns. 6) With such powerful pieces as queens still on the board, king safety plays an important role, so watch out for stalemate, mate and per- petual check.

10 Further Queen Endings
In this chapter we discuss a variety of endings with at least one queen on the board together with rooks and/or minor pieces. The most im- portant endings of this type for the practical player are queen vs rook 4- minor piece and queen vs two rooks, while some positions with queen vs rook and pawns are also of consider- able interest. Our subchapters are:
10.1: Queen vs One Minor Piece 330
10.2: Queen vs Rook 331
10.3: Queen vs Two Minor Pieces 339
10.4: Queen vs Rook and Minor Piece 341

10.1 Queen vs One Minor
Piece In the traditional material count the pawn is worth 1, bishop and knight 3, a rook 5 and the queen 9 points. Therefore, a single minor piece normally has no chance against the queen. Even with several pawns, the queen proves too strong. The following position illustrates this (see next diagram). The knight protects the pawn, shelters the king and creates a kind of barrier against the white king. However, there is a way to pene- trate:
1 Rg3! *d3

10Wd7# it was believed to be quite easy to force a win. However, the appearance of computer databases in 1978 caused the ending to be seen in a new light. While they confirmed that the queen should win from all normal starting positions, they also showed that it was quite difficult to win if the defender played precisely. Therefore, it is well worth studying the winning process, which falls into three steps: 1) Forcing the rook back into a third-rank defence and breaking that down (this is the stage where computers have had the greatest impact, by showing how tough the third-rank defence is). 2) Reaching the Philidor position from a second-rank defence, which is most often ap- plied in practice. 3) Winning the rook from Philidor's posi- tion. We will work backwards through this pro- cess, and thus start with the third step: We now move on to the second-rank defence:

A pawn on its second rank draws if it is not a rook's pawn and the defending king and rook are next to it, because no encirclement by the attacking king is possible.

A study by Genrikh Kasparian was unsound due to position 10.08. We quote from page 67 of The Complete Studies of Genrikh Kasparian'. "So the study's defect indirectly contributed a position new to endgame theory. It was not long before the position occurred in practical play - for example, Averbakh-Bondarevsky, USSR Ch (Moscow) 1948 and Flohr-Lilienthal, Budapest Ct 1950. Both Averbakh and Lilienthal suc- ceeded in drawing because they were familiar with my analysis. The story does not end there. Nine years later G.Lisitsyn, in his book Zak- liuchitelnaya Chast Shakhmatnoi Partii (Lenin- grad 1956), published the position attributing it to "N.D.Grigoriev 1917", which caused me much surprise. The priority of the position was determined, apparently, not by date of publica- tion but by the discovery of some draft notes penned by Grigoriev (d. 1938) with first actual publication in 1956..." If the rook is not yet in the right position, great difficulties might arise (see following dia- gram)'.

The winning process falls into three phases and zugzwang is the main weapon to achieve
FURTHER QUEEN ENDINGS 335
With a knight's pawn, the same procedure is impossible as the queen does not have enough room on the shorter side: each step. In the first phase the king has to cross the e-file: 1 'Nf2 Rc7 2 Ng2 Rc2+ 3 *gl 3 *g3 Rd2 4 2g4 *e5 5 He4+ *d5 and the first aim is achieved.

To summarize the results we state the fol- lowing rule for rook and pawn (not a rook's pawn!) against the queen in positions such as
10.10: if the pawn is on its original square or if
it is a knight's pawn the position is drawn, as long as the attacking king is cut off and can't get behind the pawn. Against a rook's pawn on the third rank, the attacking king must approach along the rook's file (see following diagram): 1 *f3? Surprisingly, this natural move throws away the win. To put Black in zugzwang it is neces- sary to advance from directly in front of the pawn: 1 Nh3 2g5 2 Re4 2h5+ 3 ?g4 2g5+ 4 Nh4! *g8 (4,..*f6 5 Rh7 2g6 6 *h5 2g5+ 7 Nxh6 +-) 5 Re7 *h8 6 #f7 2g7 7 Re8+ *h7 (7...2g8 8 Re5+ *h7 9 Re4+ *h8?! 10 *h5 +-) 8 Re4+ *g8 9 *h5 2h7?! 10 Re6+ *g7 1 1 Rg6+ *h8 12 Rf6+ *g8 13 *g6 +-.

In ab- solute terms though, the fortress only holds near the comer.

We would like to end the discussion of queen vs rook and minor piece with one example where the queen is defeated:
10.5 Queen vs Two Rooks
Two rooks usually match a queen and a pawn but the specific features of the given position are very important. A crucial role in the evalua- tion is played by king safety and pawn-structure - especially (connected) passed pawns and out- posts for the rooks. First we consider situations where the queen feels at home (see following diagram). Black has many weak pawns and an exposed king, while his e8-rook is not so easily brought into an attack on White's king:

FURTHER QUEEN ENDINGS 347
The next example shows a very favourable situation for the minor pieces: A) Queen and Knight vs Queen The famous saying that queen and knight form a strong duo is attributed to Capablanca. In- deed, the knight's L-shape movement ideally fits together with the queen. Nevertheless, the theoretical result of this endgame is a draw. However, if the defending king is badly placed near the edge or the queen is on an unfortunate square, there are a lot of winning motifs. These have been illustrated in many studies. When practical games are won by the queen and knight, it is most often by a series of checks forcing the king to the edge.

Is Capablanca's theorem that queen and knight are better than queen and bishop true? John Watson cast some doubt on this in his ex- cellent book Secrets of Modem Chess Strategy and came to the following conclusions: "a) an unusually large proportion of W + ft vs W + JL games are drawn; "b) most games which are won by either side ... are characterized by that side having one or more rather obvious other advantages." However, in closed positions with the bishop hemmed in by its own pawns, the knight cer- tainly is superior:

Now it is a race situation, where the principle 'do not rush' does not apply. A) Do Not Rush An endgame is different from a middlegame in many respects. When the power of the queens has disappeared from the board, the king can become more active and in most cases it is more important to activate all the forces and make all other useful moves before advancing pawns (this is not valid in race situations of course!). Capablanca demonstrates this in the following classic:

Don't miss the point where a middlegame (king safety is important) changes into an endgame (king activity is important). are less good winning attempts that don't get in the way of the 'real' one, try them first. Your opponent might make a mistake or get into time-trouble. B) Passed Pawns Must Be Pushed The next example shows the conversion of an outside passed pawn:

The following game shows that mating at- tacks can sometimes occur even in the endgame: D) Mismatches A mismatch arises when one side has more forces in a particular region of the board. This happens particularly often when one king is ac- tive while the other is still at home. Andrew Soltis explained this principle in Grandmaster Secrets: Endings with the following example:
356 FUNDAMENTAL CHESS ENDINGS
White's pieces are much more active and the c6-pawn is very weak, but where is the second weakness?
1 Ec7
1 i.c8 c5! 2 dxc5 2c6 3 Za8 Ne7 ±.
1...f5!
Now the second weakness is clear: the g6- pawn. Another disadvantage of ...f5 is that it makes the dark squares in Black's camp ex- tremely weak. However, it is necessary since otherwise i.c8 will follow; e.g" 1...2d8? 2 i.c8 Ed6 3 *e2 2f6 4 f4 2d6 5 *d2 *g7 6 *c3 *f6 7 Nb4 Ed8 8 *c5 *g7 9 i.h3 *f6 10 2c8*e7 11 2xd8*xd8 12&d6f5 13i.fl +-. 2 *e2 Bd7?

White's king will reach c7 or e8, when one of the weak pawns will fall. 13 *d3 Sd8 Waiting passively with 13...i.d7 is also not enough; e.g., 14 Nc3 e.1 15'i'b4&d8 16 2a7 Nc8 17 *c5 2f6 18 *b6 i.e8 19 2a8+ Nd7 20 *b7 Ef7 21 Ec8 *d6+ 22 Nb6 i.d7 23 2d8 *e7 24 *c7 i.e8 25 2d6 *f8+ 26 Nb6 +-. 14 i.xc6!

11.06 +/
G.Kasparov - J.Timman Linares 1992 Kasparov found a very elegant way to finish the game:
1 Ne8+ Bf7 2 xf6! *xf6 3 g5+ *f7 4 h6
1-0 White's king will move to the queenside, create a passed pawn and win the bishop. Then it will return to the kingside and win the g6-pawn. E) The Principle of Two Weaknesses This is a very important principle in endgames. It is often possible to defend a position with only one weakness. However, when the attacker suc- ceeds in creating a second one, his greater mo- bility decides the issue in many cases.

Rook's pawns are especially strong against knights; however, in other endings they might be less valuable. 6) Don't forget about the bishop and wrong rook's pawn draw! 7) The rook is a very strong counterattack- ing unit. It is not so strong in blockading enemy passed pawns. 8) Rook endings occur very often in prac- tice. Study them carefully! 9) No rule can replace concrete calculation - all 'rules' have exceptions. Calculation in the endgame is at least as important as in the mid- dlegame. 10) The art is to find the exceptions, but you are already a very strong player when you know how and where to apply the rules!

J.Pinter - B.Alterman Beersheba 1991 This innocent-looking position is quite tricky. The numbers in the following diagram should help you to understand the bishop moves.
B
6 f3=5; f7=6 We didn't want to mess things up with bishop moves into the opponent's camp, so after, e.g., w .b7 you have to find the correct answer bjke6 yourself. You will certainly have recognized that we have a reciprocal zugzwang with bishops on d3 and d7. It is much more difficult to see that White always wins when the bishop gets to the central d5-square! You can than find two other reciprocal zugzwang situations: g2-f7 and f3- c4. By saying this, we have already told you the solution: l...Ne8?

6 *b6! +- As a general rule, the above defensive set-up (after 1...Ed7) is safe on the c-, f-, g- and h-files if the attacker can't drive the rook away. How- ever, there are exceptions for the c- and h-file (see, e.g.. El 2.12). On the d- and e-files, the de- fender tries to regroup his pieces to a safe file. If the attacker can prevent this, he is winning. See SoRE 12-20 for more details.

F.Leveille - J.Desforges Quebec 1990 In the game Black was wide awake and found the only way to draw. White's intention is to bring his rook back to the fifth rank. As long as White's king is not on the a- or b-file, Black can only prevent this by posting his own rook on one of those files. Once we have understood that, we find that with b2a3 and w<3?c2 we have a reciprocal zugzwang. Thus b2b3 and w<4>d2 is also a reciprocal zugzwang, and so on. This idea was discovered by Kasparian back in 1946: w*al, 2h7, Ag6, h5; b*g8, 2g3: 1 *a2 !! +-. But back to our game.

W.Schlage - C.Ahues Berlin 1921 Black defensive strategy is known to us: it is based on hindering the white king from escap- ing from the edge after he has captured the a- pawn. However, White can prevent Black from imprisoning him if he uses the geometry of the chessboard to shoulder the black king away:
1 Ne6! *c3 2 Nd5!
Maizelis indicated this move. The game itself continued 2 Nd6? Nd4! 3 Nc6 £?e5! 4 Nb7 d6! 5 Nxa7 Nc7! = Vi-1/?,
