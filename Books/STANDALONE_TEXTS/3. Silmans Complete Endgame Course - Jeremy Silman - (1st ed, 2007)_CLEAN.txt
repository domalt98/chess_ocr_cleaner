Now, with a torrent of new chess books pouring into stores every year, that has changed-endgame books are a dime a dozen. Most chess writers think that chess players want as many positions as possible in an endgame book. And thatsoundr like a good idea! Give the chess hopeful the most bang for the buck! Stuff everything into one book! This would be reasonable for an endgame encyclopedia, and such books are good research tools. But must every chess author daze his readers with this kind of "overkill"? Of course not! In fact, more than one player has been demoralized by the sheer mass of information that many endgame books offer-it all seems so dull and so hard to grasp. Almost all players who dream of endgame improvement experience the same frustrating scenario: They buy the latest critically acclaimed and usually over stuffed endgame title, open it up (hands quivering with the exciting prospect of gleaning arcane knowledge), and read the author's assurances that they now possess the book of ultimate endgame enlightenment. However, after they spend a few days looking over several examples, they inevitably shelve it alongside all their other unread chess tomes. Pondering this common story led me to ask an important question: How can the whole endgame genre be done differently? That question led to Silman s Complete Endgame Course, which stresses individual guidance and instruction and, yes, hope for players of every rating group. This book is designed to make players who are disgusted with endgame study feel that there is light at the end of the tunnel, and it assures you that you can become an accomplished endgame player with just a little effort. By offering instruction that's tailor-made to fit a player's individual rating group, and is in accord with that player's future goals, I make endgame study easy to grasp and extremely practical for players and coaches. Of course, each coach will have opinions as to what endgames are appropriate for each rating group, so personal adjustments can always be made. Nevertheless, coaches will find my book to be an invaluable teaching tool that they can use with confidence. Silman s Complete Endgame Course is the endgame book that everyone always wanted but couldn't find. Now it's in front of you, and I hope it proves to be everything you always dreamed such a book could and should be. ] eremy Silman Los Angeles, CA All chess players want endgame skills, but doing the work to actually achieve this much-needed knowledge is anything but easy. My goal in writing this book was to take a subject that most see as boring and make it palatable, educational, and yes, even fun. Thus the following six essential points make up the philosophy beh•ind Silman s Complete Endgame CO'Urse: Rating is important. Players of different strengths need to know • different (and level-appropriate) kinds of endgames. Guidance is the key. Chess students need to be told which endgames are important for their particular level. Studying endgames that are too advanced for their rating-level will only depress them and waste their time, since they'll rarely (if ever) have need of such knowledge in the kinds of games/positions that • players of their ratings usually reach. Give players hope. By telling players that they only need to know a finite amount of easily digestible material (based on their strengths/ratings), you give them hope and confidence. Now they'll be willing to invest time in learning the recommended positions and ideas because everything is mapped out and • Eaccessible. very player should receive well-rounded training. The correct study of chess calls for balance. For example, a beginner needs to spend very little time on the endgame. (Basic mates are all he or she needs.) Instead, the beginner's main efforts should be devoted to gaining as much tactical acumen as possible. On the other hand, a tournament player in the 1500 range needs quite a bit of critical but easy-to-learn endgame knowledge if he or she wants to move up the rating ladder. However, such a player shouldn't indiscriminately study random endgame positions. The balanced study of tactics, strategy, opening theory, and appropriate • endgames is more important here than ever. Create a love for the endgame. Most players seem unable to appreciate anything but a mating attack or a tactic/combination. This is really a shame since they are missing a lot of the game's xiii xiv S I L M A N ' S C 0 M P L E T E E N D G A M E C 0 U R S E beauty. An appreciation of its final phase will not only allow them to become stronger in that area, but also add to their enjoyment of chess as a whole. • Introduce a "Unified Field ofEndgame Study." Every player needs to master a certain amount of endgame material that's pertinent to his or her strength. This means that a class "B" player (1600-1799), in order to absorb the material presented in the class "B" section, must have learned everything presented for the lower rating groups! All endgames, even the most difficult theoretical quagmires, are based on basic foundation positions-if you don't learn these, your endgame growth will suffer. How to read this book In the introduction to his excellent Dvoretsky s Endgame Manual, Dvoretsky writes, "Amazingly enough, I have not yet found a single endgame manual which I could recommend wholeheartedly to my pupils. Most existing books are either elementary and useful for novices only, or are useless methodologically, or do not cover endgame theory fully." I'm left wondering about the average strength of Dvoretsky's students. Also, how does he define "novice"? In my experience, a book that "fully" covers the endgame is exactly what players under 2400 don't need! Thus, I strongly recom mend that you put aside all other endgame books and trust your endgame study to Silman s Complete Endgame Course. There is an important place for the various fine endgame books found in my recommended book list. However, they will only prove useful once you finish my course and have gained a solid master's grasp of endgame theory. Remember, I'm trying to make your precious study time count. Jumping from book to book is a fast track to nowhere. Silman s Complete Endgame Course is not organized by endgame type, which is how it's been done in the past. Unfortunately, organizing the study of endgames by type ultimately fails the student by offering too much information too fast. Instead, I've divided my book by rating-by what you personally need to know so that your endgame IQ is equal to your overall playing strength. For example, if you have just learned to play, all you need to study is the section designed for beginners (Part One). After mastering the material there, put the book away and spend your time studying tactics and a few strategic concepts. Once your overall strength tightens up and you feel you're ready to break into class "E", re-open this book and master the material that's been designed for players rated from 1000 to 1199 (Part Two), then repeat this process as you move up the rating ladder. I N T R 0 D U C T I 0 N xv If you already possess a high rating, let's say class "B" (Part Five), you must make sure you completely understand everything in the earlier sections before tackling the "B" material. If you fail to do this, you'll find yourself lost, confused, and frustrated. Patiently go through each part of the book up to or, at most, one part above your present rating. Make sure you thoroughly understand the lessons in each part of the book. Memorization is a very poor substitute for true understanding. Once you attain Expert strength (2000-2199), or once you're a strong " A" player and wish to step up to the next level, the book's material changes some what and a concept I call "flowcharts" is explored. Nothing in this section will make sense if you haven't carefully studied and absorbed everything I presented earlier. Next, we come to the Master lessons (Part Eight), which embrace concepts more than positions or memorization. Oddly, I think class "A" players and Experts can get a lot out of this section, so feel free to leap ahead and read it if you've already reached these levels. Part Nine is Endgames for Pure Pleasure. Here anyone of any rating can enjoy the comic look of entombed or dominated minor pieces, tactics in the endgame, and a study of The Five Greatest Endgame Players of All Time. You might not necessarily understand all of this section's nuances if you're of less than Expert strength, but that shouldn't prevent you from deriving a good deal of pleasure from the examples. \Vhen studying this book, please remem her that I've deliberately left out many endgames. \Vhy? Because I don't feel they are important to players under the 2vs4.0L0 level. For example, I heretically decided not to include Bishop and Knight one King because it's far from easy to master, and it occurs very rarely in over-the-board play. In fact, I only got it once in my entire career, while IM John Watson and IM John Donaldson never got it at all! Is such a rarity really worth the two or three hours it would take to learn it? I say no. Ultimately, this is what Silman s Complete Endgame Course is all about: Learning what's useful, and devoting the rest of your precious study time to other areas of the game. This book owes its existence to the endgame-laments of countless frustrated players that I've encountered over the course of my chess career. I would like to express my gratitude to Jack Peters, Yasser Seirawan, and John Watson. They all deserve far more than mere thanks for the help they have supplied in the writing of this book. Finally, I also need to thank my old Haight-Ashbury buddies Sky Monkey and Penguin Delight, who told me that repeated exposure to the Door's "This is the End" would eventually result in the creation of a chess tome on the same subject. Amazingly, they were proved right. xvi �.

- z z e all have to start somewhere, and though endgames should take a back seat to tactics and the basics of strategy when you're a begin ner, it is annoying (if you equate pain, agony, and self-loathing to annoying) to find yourself with an extra Queen in the endgame and not know how to deliver checkmate. Since you'll be called on to perform these endgame mates over and over again, spending the hour or two it will take to master these extremely easy-to-learn positions is a must! Think about it: an hour of work for a lifetime of endgame confidence. Quite a deal, isn't it? \Vhen players first learn the game, they are often taught to always play to the last breath since "nobody ever won a game by resigning." Though the defender's fate is more or less a foregone conclusion when he's a Rook or more down, it doesn't hurt him to continue and watch the final mating net unfold-thus learn ing how to do it when he is on the winning side. Eventually, the beginner will resign such situations when he begins to play against experienced tournament players, but at first it's not a bad idea to always play them out and see if the op ponent knows his stuff. Don't doubt that your opponents will play them out, so this chapter is a must if you've just learned to play the game. Beginners only need to be aware of two endgame situations: Overkill Mates (one side has an enormous amount of material versus the lone enemy King) and Stalemates (one side has no legal moves, but is not in check).

You've played a pretty good game (no shame in feeling proud after a great effort). Though you were not able to get an early mating attack, you picked up some extra material and, as the game continued, added to your booty until you found yourself way, way ahead. Trading and more devouring of enemy units ensues until an overkill endgame is reached. What do you do now? To win an overkill endgame, you only need to learn two techniques: the Staircase and the Box. The Staircase When you are up by a Queen and a Rook, or even by two Queens (or more!), one must wonder if your opponent (who could give up and show a bit ofrespect) is bullheaded or simply enjoys suffering and/or pain. Whatever his reasons for continuing might be, you are the o ne who must now demonstrate how easy it is to score the victory. Though there are many ways to force a quick mate in such situations, the simple device recommended here (the Staircase) makes all endgames where you are up by two major-also known as heavy-pieces (Q + Q or Q + R or R + R) a no-brainer to win. The three key components of the Staircase are: ---·r··, ___,111 ,11"' ,' Push the enemy King to one of the four sides of the board. Diagram 1

In diagram 4, White has just played Qf7+. Black's King can't move towards the middle due to the Rook's "force field," thus it must step to the board's side.

Kicking black's King off the 7th rank After 1. ..Kc8 (or 1 . . . Kb8 or I . . .Kd8), the Queen now stops the King from moving forward. This frees the Rook from "King-containing duty," allowing it to administer the final blow with 2.Rg8 mate. Note how the movements of the Rook and Queen resemble steps up or down a Staircase. Repeating this information in paragraph form: As in almost all mating end games, you need to push the enemy King to the back rank. The point of the Staircase is to use one major piece (Rook or Queen) to keep the enemy King from stepping onto a rank o r fi le. Then the other major piece will give check along the next rank or file, forcing the target King to step closer to its doom on the side of the board. Play over the positions in this section quickly (it's not rocket science, so there's no need to ponder it), and the Staircase will rapidly become engrained in your mind.

REMEMBER
Watch out for your Rook -unlike the two Queens, the Black King can approach the Rook and threaten to take it. \Vhite elects to push the King to the edge of the board rank-by-rank. He could have done the same thing file-by-file with l .Qe2+ Kd5 2 .Rd l+ Kc5 3 .Qc2+ Kb4

Both the 3rd and 4th ranks can no longer be stepped on by the black King, and \Vhite is slowly but surely herding it towards the edge of the board.

4 ... Ke2 4.Rf2+ Not 4.Qh2+ since that would free up the 3rd rank and allow 4 . . . Ke3 (though that tiny mistake could easily be rectified by 5.Qg3+ Ke2 6.Rf2+, transposing back into the game. 4 ...Kel 5.Qglmate. King and Two Rooks vs. Lone King Once again, the stronger side should push the opponent's King towards the edge of the board since, once it's there, it can no longer step backwards out of harm's way. Of course, this example is harder than the previous two since the King can approach white's Rooks and threaten them.
USEFUL ADVICE
Keep your Rooks as far from the enemy King as possible. That way the King can't attack them. 1 .Re l + Diagram 1 0 a b c d e g h Push black's King to the side The plan is as follows: take files/ranks away from the enemy King while push ing it towards the side of the board, and keep your Rooks as far away from the beleaguered monarch as possible. Your goal (trapping the King on the side), mixed with patience and safety, will always get the job done. 1 . . .Kd3 Now black's King can't cross over the e-file since it is controlled by a white Rook. Also possible was l . . .Kf3 when 2 .Rf2+?? Kxf2 is the stuff ofnightmarcs. However, mate will occur fairly quickly if \Vhite remembers to keep his Rooks far away from black's King: 1.. .Kf3 2.Rg8!

Rooks usually prefer to check at a distance!

Play around with it a bit more and, when it becomes mindlessly easy, move on to our next technique. The Box This is a very important endgame idea, and chances to use it will occur re markably often throughout your chess career. Keep in mind that the Box isn't always the fastest way to mate, merely the easiest to learn. In the case of both King and Queen vs. King, and King and Rook vs. King, the goal is to imprison the enemy monarch in an ever-shrinking Box. The point about using both King and Queen to force mate is an important one. Chess is a team game where your pieces depend on your whole army to get a job done. Since a lone Rook or even Queen can't mate the enemy King, you will have to get your King involved if you wish to score the full point. In most endgames-basic and complicated-King participation is a huge part of a successful winning campaign or defensive stand.

Study this endgame carefully until you can easily checkmate your friends and your computer from the starting position of diagram 16. King and Rook vs. Lone King This ending is by far the hardest we'll study in this beginner to 1 000 section. As in Queen and King vs. Lone King, \Vhite can only mate if his King participates in the process. And, as with the other positions we've explored, we'll solve this one by using the "shrinking Box technique." First, let's start from the end and show the most basic winning situation. Diagram 1 9
[diagram]
A mate based on a team effort A team effort has led to the mating of the black King. \Vhite's King has deprived its counterpart of f7, g7, and h7, while the Rook calls check and dominates the whole back rank. Clearly, \Vhite needs to do two things to win the King and Rook vs. lone King endgame: --� He needs to employ both his King and Rook. The lone Rook --� Hcan't mate the enemy King. e needs to drive Black to the edge (any edge!) of the board. Our next position shows how we reached that final mate.

However, a mate isn't possible without help from the white King. 1 .Kd6 The move to d6 (1 .Ke6 is just as good) threatens mate, but black's King doesn't intend to stay around and let it happen! 1 ...

Ka8 4.Kb6 Kb8 (an example of forced suicide) 5 .Rh8 mate.
2.Rb7
The only way \Vhite can win is to force the black King to step in front of white's. The direct approach doesn't work: 2 .Ke6 Kd8 3.Kd6 Ke8, etc. The seemingly innocuous 2 .Rb7 gives away a move and sets up a situation where Black will be forced to do the very thing he dreads: to step in front of the white King and allow an instant mate. 2 . . . Kf8 Putting off the inevitable, which would have instantly occurred after 2 . . .Kd6 3 .Rb8 mate. 3 .Ke6 Now we can see white's strategy: Not want ing to play 3 . . .Ke8 due to 4.Rb8 mate, Black is forced to flee to the right. However, he will soon run out of board and this will force him to dance the other way-right into white's web!
USEFUL ADVICE
White will usually mate his opponent by forcing the enemy King to self-destructively step in front of white's (thus giving us the kind of position shown in diagram 1 9 ) .
REMEMBER
In general, put as much distance as possible between your Rook and the enemy King!

Let me repeat (for the umpteenth time! ) an important point: there are faster ways to force mate! However, our goal is to employ the simple but effective Box strategy we are sacrificing speed for the slow, sure, and easy-to-learn approach. It is imperative that you use your King in this endgame!

You would be getting a feel for the method by now: shrink the box with the Rook, move the King, shrink the box with the Rook, move the King. Repeat until mate occurs.
REMEMBER
White is not in any hurry.Just follow the prescribed process and the game will literally win itself.
USEFUL ADVICE
In general you want to keep your Rook as far away from the enemy King as possible. 0 ne of the few exceptions is when you're creating Boxes in an effort to push the enemy King back to one of the board's corners or sides. !"

That's it! You now know the winning ideas for all overkill endgames. \Vhen I played in my first tournament (at age twelve), it suddenly occurred to me that I didn't know the difference between checkmate and stalemate. Later in life I got a long distance phone call from a couple in New York who had somehow found my number. It seems they had a disagreement over what a checkmate and stalemate were, and had placed a bet. The man was positive that he was going to win the wager, and he was stunned when I explained that he was completely wrong. Just in case you are suffering from the same confusion I (and that couple) did, let's clarify both (using Black as the weaker side): �-'I�.1:-�M�T�: Black's King is not in check, but there is no legal move on the board that would not result in the King's capture. Since you're not allowed to purposely place your King on an attacked square, a state of "stalemate" is said to exist and the game is declared a draw. �H-���-¥A.-!¥.:: \Vhen \Vhite is threatening to capture the black King and Black can't do anything to prevent its loss, the game is declared over due to checkmate, with \Vhite winning the game as a result. Diagram 2 7 If \Vhite has the move in diagram 27, he wins by 1 .Qbl mate or 1 .Qb2 mate or 1 . Qa3 mate or 1.Qa4 mate. In each case the black King is threatened with capture and has no way of preventing it!
P A R T O N E - E N D G A M E S F O R B E G I N N E R S ( U N R A T E D - 9 9 9 ) 21
If Black has the move in diagram 27, there are only three possible places for the black King to go: . .. Ka2, . . . Kb2, or ... Kbl. However, ... Ka2 would allow Qxa2, . . . Kb2 would allow both Qxb2 and Kxb2, and .. . Kbl would allow both Qxbl and Kxbl. A King is not allowed to step onto an attacked square, which means Black doesn't have a legal move. Thus, the game ends in stalemate and is declared drawn. Diagram 28
[diagram]
Black to move Many pieces, still a stalemate
REMEMBER:
The differences between checkmate and stalemate: in the case of a checkmate, the enemy K ing is in check and can't escape c apture. In the case of a stalemate, the enemy King is not attacked, he has no legal move, and thus the game is drawn because a player can't be forced to do something illegal. A stalemate can occur when Black has a lone King or several pieces. In diagram 2 8, a close look tells us that none of black's pieces can legally move any move of the e I-Bishop hangs the King to Rxa 1 , any move of the Knight hangs the King to Bxal, the pawn is blocked by its white counterpart and can't move, and black's King can't move to a2 (due to Qxa2) or bl (due to Kxbl). However, at the moment black's King isn't under attack, which means that the game will be declared drawn by stalemate since you are never allowed to make an illegal move. D iagram 29

In diagram 2 9 Black does not draw by stalemate because he has a legal move: 1 .. . a5 (which he must play), which would be met by 2.Qxh2 mate, or 2.Bxh2 mate, or 2.Qa3 mate, or 2.Rxel mate. Diagram 30
[diagram]
Check and mate! This is similar to Diagram 28, but this time black's King is under direct attack by the c3-Bishop. Since l. . . Ka2 and l. ..Kbl both illegally place the King on an attacked square, and since l. . . Bxc3 isn't legal since it allows Rxal, the game ends with checkmate and a white victory.
USEFUL ADVICE:
M astering the overkill checkmates means you have also become acutely aware of stalemate disasters. Zill,.S X &Jl& ti,4MU4A4KX:. k4£A£U,Q ALU iititt4. It's very important to know what a stalemate is-when you are winning the game you want to avoid falling for one and tossing your win into the garbage. However, when you are the weaker side, being aware of possible stalemate swindles will oc casionally save you a precious half point. Our next example illustrates a nice blend of basic mate strategy with a stale mate spider-sense. Diagram 3 1

1.Qg7! This is the move that best fits in with our endgame philosophy: trap
the King on the back rank and mate will surely follow. After 1. ..Kd8 (forced)
2.Qd7 it's mate.
Another move that fits in with this concept is 1.Qc7, trapping the black King, when 1. .. Kf8 2 .Ke6 Kg8 3.Kf6 Kh8 4.Qg7 is mate. Notice how nice and simple these moves are, but what about 1.Qf6 ?This seems effective, but there's one problem: the game suddenly is drawn due to stalemate! That's right, Black has no legal moves because he's not allowed to move his King into check. � In the endgame, the enemy King can rarely be mated in the middle of the board. You almost always want to chase it to one of the four sides, or to a corner. � The Staircase maneuver is the easiest way to make use of a lopsided material count such as two Queens vs. lone King, Queen and Rook vs. lone King, or two Rooks vs. lone King. � The Box is a technique that enables you to limit the enemy King's space. As you shrink the Box, you force his King to eventually retreat to the side of the board, where you will finally be able to mate it. � If you are left with King and Queen vs. lone King, or King and Rook vs. lone King, you can't mate with the major piece alone. You will need to use both your major piece and King to finish the enemy off. � Watch out for stalemates! There is nothing worse than setting your opponent up for the killing blow, then botching the whole thing to a draw by overlooking that you' ve stalemated his King! In situations where stalemates might be possible (i.e., the King has limited squares to move to), always take a moment before moving and ask, "When I play this move, will his King have a legal square to go to?" - ·-·--

If you didn't get this right, please go back and study the material under Stalemate Alert! So you've learned to play chess, you've played a bunch of games online or with friends face to face, you've picked up an opening idea or two by glancing in a chess book, and you've also begun to recognize a few tactical tricks-often by painful experience! Now, having carefully gone over this chapter, you're able to finish-off an opponent if you reach an Overkill endgame situation. It's time to put aside this book and continue to gain valuable over-the-board experience by crossing swords with players equal to or a bit better than your self. If money is available, you can accelerate your progress by taking lessons. Of course, going over tactical quizzes is always a great idea-books featuring mates in one, two, and three, plus "\Vhite to play and win" tactical puzzles are plentiful and very useful. Or, Study Part Two-which will put you one step ahead of your expected endgame IQ-and then put aside this book and follow the earlier advice. In either case, once you feel you've improved and reached a higher rating/skill level, it will be time to crack open this book anew and move on the next series of endgame lessons. y first rating was 1068. Aside from the overkill mates (see Part One), I knew nothing at all about endgames. This didn't seem to affect me too much because I lost the vast majority of my games rather quickly and rarely had need of any endgame skills at all. However, now-as an International Master-I'm very aware of the plight of the beginning tournament player, and can't allow the level of total endgame ignorance I possessed when I was a class "E" neophyte to carry over to my students. Instead, I always demand that they learn a few endgame basics that, though easy to absorb, will create a simple but highly useful foundation for later moves up the rating ladder. Here in Part Two, you'll learn what material advantages do and don't win, and you'll take your first step into the world of serious endgame knowledge you'll develop an appreciation for the powers of the King, the mysteries of the Opposition, and the drawing proclivities of the rook-pawns. Sound daunting? It's all far easier to understand than you might imagine, and a couple hours effort will make you the master of this extremely important material. When you reach a position where your opponent has lost everything but his King (which, of course, can't be captured), it's a must to know what material you'll need to force a checkmate. On the other hand, you can save many poor positions by leaving your opponent with an insufficient amount of mating mate rial when you are the one with the lone King. Clearly, a knowledge of what can (or cannot) mate vs. a lone King is extremely important! �:> Queen = CAN! ··2 > Two Rooks = CAN! . · :3'> Rook = CAN! ··- ··{>· Two Bishops = CAN! · --:r> Bishop and Knight = CAN! .. Pawn = CANNOT ! (Unless it can successfully promote.) _... .. Bishop = CANN
OT!
.. Knight = CANNOT! m> Two Knights = CANNOT ! We've already seen (in Part One) that a King and Rook (or more) vs. a lone King mates easily. Thus, the first three items on our list need no comment. (If you are not 100% sure that you can mate in those situations, go back and master those endgames!) Two Bishops (4) is too complex for this section but will be examined later in the book (though, considering your specific target rating, you might find that you will never have a need to learn it). Bishop and Knight (5) might never occur in your whole chess lifetime and is far too difficult to waste your precious study time on (in other words, this book won't examine Bishop and Knight vs. King at all). The basics of a lone pawn (6) will be presented here in Part Two, and a deeper knowledge of King and pawn vs. King will be presented in Parts Three and Four. Bishop (7) and Knight (8) are sad facts, but you simply can't mate your opponent with King and minor piece vs. King even if he's trying to help you! This leaves us with the final item on the list, two Knights vs. a lone King.
34 S I L M A N' S C O M P L E T E E N D G A M E C O U R S E
... The odd case of two Knights vs. King is the most frustrating and unfair situ ation on our list. Two pieces up and White can't win against proper defense! How is that possible? Let's take a look. Diagram 3 8 a h c d e f g h One move draws, one loses The first thing that must be understood is that White only has a chance to de liver mate in this endgame if black's King willingly steps onto a corner square. In the diagramed position, White has correctly herded black's King to the side of the board and has even driven him near that important corner square. Black is in check by the f6-Knight and only has two legal moves. If he moves to the poisoned square on h8 he'll be mated by Nf7. However, if he avoids it with I .. . Kf8 then White will never be able to force mate. In other words, Black can only get mated if he blunders .
USEFUL ADVICE
When defending a King vs. Two Knights endgame, as long as you avoid a l , a8, hl or h8 ( any corner square), you'll draw the game. Inexperienced players occasionally think that a lone minor piece (i.e., a Bishop or Knight) might be able to put up some resistance versus a lone Queen. Let me assure you that nothing could be further from the truth! We will explore both possibilities (Bishop vs. Queen and Knight vs. Queen) and demonstrate beyond any shadow of a doubt that the poor minor piece is completely outgunned. Bishop vs. Queen This is a no contest! One poor Bishop can't hope to face o ff against a mighty Queen! l . . .al =Q Diagram 39 a b c d e g h Black to move It's important that Black promote his pawn immediately else \Vhite will pre vent it by Bg7 . Black should treat a Queen vs. Bishop situation in the same way as a King and Queen vs. lone King. The only difference: you must be a bit careful about stepping onto the colored squares controlled by the Bishop.

Be patient! As your Queen and King cut off more and more of the board, he'll eventually be forced to give ground and run for the sidelines, which is just where you want him! Players that are starting out tend to think of the King as an annoyance-some thing that demands constant protection, but gives very little back in the life and death battles that ultimately determine a game's result. This view is as wrong as wrong can be, and the following material shows just how critically important the King is to success in chess. Use Your King! In chess, the opening and middlegame is a dangerous time for each side's King-both of them suffering from a "wanted dead-or-alive" mentality. The enormous threat of enemy pieces crashing through the center and mating one's King has led books and teachers to give the student a bit of excellent advice: castle as quickly as possible (this gets it out of the center and activates the Rooks) and shield the needy monarch behind its pawns. Sadly, wisdom in one situation isn't always wisdom in another, and what passes for correct opening and middlegame strategy can often be wrong in the endgame. The truth is, the King is a very stnmg piece (at least as strong as a Bishop or Knight)! Unfortunately, the terror created by the game's early phases causes most players to lose sight of this piece's true worth. The endgame poses very different problems and needs than the other phases. With minimal material remaining on the board, both players need to make use of everything they have left. Furthermore, in the endgame, pawns and Kings take on enormous significance. Since the threat to the Kings is no longer real (the enemy's limited army no longer poses any danger to his Majesty), both players should rush their King to the center of the board as quickly as possible! LET ME REPEAT: Once the board clears of pieces, a player must make use of everything he has. The time has come for the King-which is finally safe from a possible assault by a large enemy force-to emerge and lead the remains of his army to the final victory. The message here is very simple: when an endgame occurs, rush your King to the center of the board!

Kit Z .. . 11£ 4 Ji U.ttilll.!Ui i .4kLki4MU4.kl41Ui. Because of the King's importance, the tournament "E" player (i.e., those with a rating under 1200) needs to take the first steps in understanding the basic movements of the King and the white and black King's relation to each other. It is very important to look over the following examples again and again until the ideas are fully absorbed. To start, let's take a quick look at a critically important endgame that occurs all the time: Diagram 43 a b c d e g h Black to move Though \Vhite cannot mate with a King and lone pawn, he CAN promote his pawn to a Queen-a Rook will do, but why not go for the biggest gun possible? As a result of this fact, every King and pawn vs. King situation is all about one thing: can the pawn promote? The position in diagram one is a common one and shows a simple but intense battle: \Vhite wants a new Queen (which will lead to an easy win), and Black wants to stop this from happening (which will lead to a draw). 1 .. .Kd6 2.Ke4 Ke6 3.d5+ Kd6 4.Kd4 Kd7 5.Ke5 Ke7 6.d6+ Kd7 7.Kd 5 Kd8 8.Kc6 Kc8 9.d7+ Kd8 10.Kd6 stalemate. Black managed to achieve his goal (draw). But do you know how he did it? Could \Vhite have improved his play? To understand what was going on and what the moves for both sides meant, you need a basic knowledge of Opposi tion. So, let's leap into that subject, thoroughly master it, and then return to the position in diagram one.
42 S I L M A N ' S C O M P L E T E E N D G A M E C O U R S E
Opposition The quest for domination between two opposing Kings is called the Opposition, whereby one King tries to become stronger than the other. Diagram 44 a h c d e f g h Basic Opposition \Vhoever moves loses the Opposition This diagram illustrates the most basic and direct form of Opposition (Of course, the absence of other material means that neither side can win. I'm just illustrating Opposition here and nothing else!). Both Kings would like to advance and gain ground, and both Kings have moved into a position that prevents the other from doing so. In such a situation it is a disadvantage to have the move since you must give up control of one of the blockade squares (shown by the three Xs in the diagram) and thus allow the opponent a way into your position. Thus Black to move would give White the power of the Opposition or, more simply put, the Opposition. 1 .. . Kc6 Poor Black would like to say "pass" but this luxury is denied him. Note that l. . . Ke6 would allow White to make inroads by 2.Kc5 while l...Kd7 allows White to advance and keep the Opposition by 2.Kd5.
2.Ke5 White has successfully penetrated into the enemy position.
As you can see, owning the Opposition often allows your King to make ad vances into enemy territory. While this means nothing in a barren King vs. King situation, basic Opposition and the need to effect penetration into the hostile camp has enormous importance in a pawn endgame. Let's go back to our earlier King and pawn vs. King position and study it more deeply.

In the game continu ation-l...Kd6 2 .Ke4 Ke6-it's White to move, meaning that Black has taken the Opposition and stopped white's King from stepping past its pawn. Please ponder this small but subtle difference until the concept of Opposition and the importance of who has the move completely sinks in. An important mistake-that we will fully explore in Part Three-is 2 .. .Kc6??. This let's white's King move forward (and step in front of its pawn) by 3.Ke5 when White wins (again, you can jump ahead to Part Three if you want an immediate explanation of this). Moves like 2 . . .Kc7?? 3.Ke5, 2 ... Kd7?? 3.Kd5, and 2 . .. Ke7?? 3.Ke5 also allow white's King to step in front of its pawn and should be avoided!

The reason for this resides in the diminished activity of any King that steps in front of such a pawn (since that King can now only move towards the center of the board-go ing the other way would make the poor monarch fall off the edge of the world). This diminished activity allows many stalemate possibilities that simply don't occur with other pawns.

Knowing what can and can't mate is must know information, while a basic knowledge of the Opposition is crucial if you wish to thrive in the arena of players rated over 1000! These set up the foundation for the far more complex endgames you'll be learning as your overall chess strength continues to rise. remember going to my first tournament at age twelve. It was all quite magi cal , and as I watched other player's games in the under 1 600 section I recall being amazed at their skills-skills which were far beyond anything I could fully understand at that time. Indeed, my view of 1 200- 1 3 99 players as be ing demigods is not that out of line. Someone in this range is beginning to grasp many aspects of chess that would have seemed too difficult a short time before. If he plays in tournaments, he holds his own against many experienced players. If he competes against non-tournament playing friends, he most likely dominates them. If you are reading this section, you either are a class "D" player, or you have learned all the material in the first two parts and wish to use this additional knowledge to help you break into the " 1 200-club." By this time you know a few openings, you have a reasonable grasp of tactics, and you've learned a positional concept or two. However, if you study with others in this rating range, you will quickly discover that endgames are not a priority, and endgame knowledge is often non-existent. That's one reason why players get stuck at a certain strength, and this is a shame since learning the material in the first three parts is within everyone's grasp-both talent-wise and time-wise. So, before reading this section, make sure that you are thoroughly familiar with all the material presented in the first two parts of this book. Now it's time to gently add on to the knowledge we've already gained. You won't find anything too intense or profound here; all we're going to do is expand on the previously assimilated concepts and, when the smoke clears, leave you with a very solid endgame base. You'll need this for Part Four, which will take us far beyond anything presented thus far. Here you'll add to your knowledge of Opposition, gain a deeper understand ing of King-and-pawn vs. King positions, take a quick look at the drawing pos sibilities of rook-pawns, and be introduced to the simple but oh-so-important concept of Fox in the Chicken Coup. In Part Two we learned all about basic Opposition-the battle of Kings that are only one square apart. This begs an obvious question: does Opposition exist if the Kings are more than one square away from each other? The answer is a resounding YES! In fact, Opposition exists from a distance, on diagonals, and even if the Kings don't seem to connect at all! Sound terrifying? Too complicated? Trust me when I assure you that it's not. Carefully look over the material that follows (several times if necessary) and it will eventually begin to make sense. Then, after even more viewings, it will suddenly seem to be simplicity itself!

King and Pawn vs. Lone King ( Stronger Side's King is in Front of its Pawn) We've seen that the defender can usually draw if he gets his King in front of the enemy pawn. However, the stronger side's winning chances go way up if he manages to place his own King in front of his pawn. \\'hen this happens, three questions will decide the issue: · 1 · > Is the pawn a rook-pawn? -�] ,>- Is the stronger side's King one square or two squares in front of its pawn? 3 > \\'ho possesses the Opposition? Another Rook-Pawn, Another Draw Unless the defending King is on vacation elsewhere on the board, the presence of a rook-pawn will make the game a draw. Diagram 6 1

If you're trying to win and you can enter a pawn up endgame where you have a rook-pawn, be careful! The words "rook-pawn" and "draw" seem to be bound at the hip! 6 1 i . k i t . " . Uil\tl(�IJI'

Such a beautifully placed white King would ensure victory if the pawn was anything other than a rook-pawn. Unfortunately for \\'bite, black's King can't be chased out of the corner. 1 .h4 Kg8 Black's moves are not hard to find!

Non Rook-Pawn (One Square in Front, is it Enough?) \\'hen the stronger side gets his King one square i n front of his pawn, the only question that matters is, "\\'ho owns the Opposition?" If the defender has it, then the game is a draw. If the stronger side has the Opposition, then the game 1s won. Diagram 62 a h c d e f g h Whoever moves fails to achieve his goal In diagram 62, whoever has the move fails to achieve his goal since that would give the opponent the Opposition. Let's first see what happens if \\'bite has the move (which means that Black has the Opposition).
REMEMBER
When the stronger side gets his King one square in front of his non rook-pawn, the only question that matters is, "Who owns the Opposition?"

l.Ke3 Obviously l .Ke2 Ke4 is our basic draw, studied in Part Two. l .. .Ke5! Retaining the Opposition and not allowing white s King to come forward. Losing is 1 . . . Kc5 (it retains the Opposition but lets white's King dance forward)
2.Ke4 when White wins. We'll see how this is done in a moment.
2.Kd3
The basic draw is reached after 2 .Kf3 Kd4, so White squiggles a bit before accepting the inevitable. 2 ...Kd5! 3.Kc3 Kc5 and White can't make any progress at all. If Black moves first (from diagram 62), though, things are very, very different: l . . .Ke5 Note that on l . . .Ke6 2.Ke4, l . . . Kc6 2.Kc4, and l . . . Kd6 2 .Kd4, White man ages to move forward and retain the Opposition. The other move, 1 . . . Kc5 , runs into 2 .Ke4 with the same kind of play as will be seen against 1 . . . Ke5.
2.Kc4
Retaining the Opposition by 2.Ke3 takes us back to our original position after 2 . . . Kd5. Diagram 6 3

Stepping forward Stepping forward is the most important thing, with Opposition taking a back seat to this. Why? Because White can only win if he gains control of the queening square, while also making sure that his pawn is safe. This takes us to the winning formula for such positions.

A very important moment. \\'bite was not able to advance his King safely anymore (i.e., 3 .Kb5?? Kd5 ! and \\'bite can't stop his opponent from marching forward and eating the pawn), so it's time to regain the Opposition and once again force his opponent backward. 3 . . .Ke6 4.Kc5

However, the possibility to devalue the opponent's respective majority is also present. White to move could play 1 .a5 when that one queenside pawn freezes black's two.

As you can see, a player must always be on the alert for such "freezing" moves! �:.· In positions where a minor piece, Bishop or Knight, faces a lone pawn, any winning chances that might exist lie with the pawn. This might seem strange, but it makes perfect sense: a lone Bishop or Knight can't mate, but a pawn has the potential to become a Rook or Queen. In such situations, players sometimes refer to pawns of this nature as "baby Queens" since they have one purpose in life: to reach the end of the board and become an adult! The question, then, is very basic: can the Bishop or Knight stop the pawn from reaching its final destination? If it can, then a draw results. If it can't, the game must be immediately resigned since a lone minor piece can't withstand the raw power of a Queen (as we saw in Part Two)! Bishop vs. Lone Pawn This tends to be a ridiculously easy draw, since the Bishop can stop the pawn's march from a distance (which it can usually do even without help from its King).
REMEMBER
A Bishop can stop a pawn even from a long distance. Diagram 7 1

This Knight dance around the enemy pawn is the usual way such Knight vs. pawn endgames are saved-it allows the Knight to keep a permanent eye on the square in front of the pawn, thus stopping it from safely advancing. Such end games are almost always drawn (the one exception is a rook-pawn) if the Knight can actually land on (or maintain a connection with) the square in front of the pawn (as it did on moves one, via l .Nb4+, and two, 2 .Nc2). Instead, 3 .Na l+?? loses to 3 . . .Kb2 , winning the Knight and the game. 3 ...Kb2 4.Kg7 c2 5.Nxc2 , draw. Going back to diagram 7 3 , we now give Black the move. However, the game is still a draw since \\'bite can target two squares in front of the pawn: c2 and c l . If the Knight can safely land on (or keep connected to) the square (or squares, if the pawn isn't on the 7th rank) in front of the pawn, the game will be drawn (a rook-pawn being the one case where exceptions might occur). 4 $4llJ,£ .. .XtA4 It t L .

A lone Knight can only triumph over a lone pawn if that pawn is a rook-pawn and if its King is trapped in front of it. Why?

I've clearly ratcheted up the difficulty level in this section-diagonal and non-connecting forms of Opposition, King and pawn endgames, Fox in the Chicken Coup, the Deep Freeze. All this is a far cry from the overkill mates in Part One! Nevertheless, the fact is that all these endgames and their accomplanying rules are extremely easy to absorb if you give the information a bit of time to sink in. Just because things appear hard due to a wide-eyed first impression doesn't mean that they are. Yes, it will take more time than previously asked to thoroughly master this material. But you do have to master it-you shouldn't continue in this book until every nuance of Opposition, Fox in the Chicken Coup, and Deep Freeze is completely assimilated. he need to know endgames becomes a much higher priority once you reach the 1400- 1 599 range. In the United States, this rating group represents the average tournament player, and this means that you've probably become serious about moving up the ranks. To successfully do that, you'll need to expand your endgame arsenal and master a series of easy to learn but critically important positions and concepts. Now it's time to take it to another level, to digest ideas that might appear difficult and even profound, but will turn out to be easy to grasp and remember-once you put a little effort into it, of course! This chapter is far larger than any other chapter in this book. \Vhy? Because a quantum leap in endgame understanding is necessary if one wishes to be a solid class "C" player who has aspirations for advancement. Thus, here you'll hone the skills already acquired in this book, and come face to face for the first time with many of the most important "must know" positions and concepts in chess. Thus far we've mastered the Opposition and basic King and pawn vs. lone King theory-If you haven't mastered this material, stop (or this book will self destruct!), go back to Part Three, and catch up! Now we'll hone the King and pawn skills you already possess, and give you some new, extremely useful, tools. King and Pawn vs. Lone King (A Quick Tussle for Opposition) King and pawn vs. lone King endgames are, for the most part, pretty simple affairs. In fact, a glance is usually enough to let you know who will own the Opposition and whether or not the defending side will be able to set up the basic drawing position. However, there are a few cases where some subtlety is demanded from one or both players. Diagram 88 a h c d e f g h \Vhite to move This position is actually quite confusing. If one follows our rules of Opposi tion with 1 .Kf2-creating a rectangle whose connection points are on f2, f8, h8, and h2 and taking the Opposition-then the game will be drawn after 1 . . . Kg7 2 .Ke3 Kf6 when both 3 .Kf4 and 3 .Ke4 are met by 3 . . .Ke6 with a basic draw. If 9 1

this doesn't make any sense, run, don't walk, to Part Three and read the section on Indirect Opposition again. \Vhite failed to win this position because he wasn't able to get his King in front of his pawn. So, tossing immediate thoughts of Opposition out the window, the only way to get white's King in front of its pawn is:
USEFUL ADVICE
If taking the Opposition fails to accomplish the goal of getting the King in front of its pawn, then it's useless to take the Opposition in the first place. l.Ke2! This advances the King and moves it away from the enemy monarch l ... Kg7 Black can take Indirect Opposition by 1 . . .

Diagram 9 1 a h c d e f g b Black to move, White wins Black to move seems to be okay since he can take the Opposition by 1 . . .Ke8. However, he's actually dead lost since 2.d6 Kd8 3 .d7 highlights the fact that he can't move straight back (as in diagram 89). This means that Black should resign after 3 . . .Kc7 4.Ke7.

Our oft-repeated rule (i.e., if the stronger side's King gets one square in front of its pawn the result of the game depends on who has the Opposition), shockingly, turns out to have two exceptions! This can prove confusing to many players, so look at the differences between the last three examples (Again and again, if need be!) until you fully understand what has occurred. Once you've done this, we're ready for our next position. If the stronger side's King gets one square in front of its pawn, the result of the game depends on who has the Opposition unless one of two exceptions are present: • The game is drawn if the pawn is a rook-pawn; • If a non rook-pawn is on the 5th rank and its King is on the 6th, taking the Opposition won't save the defender.

Sneaking into a Winning King and Pawn vs. King Position By now you should know when a basic King and pawn vs. lone King position is lost or drawn. This knowledge allows you to correctly gauge more complex situations where the prospect of pawn exchanges forces you to decide whether the resulting position is favorable to your cause. Diagram 96 This kind of position, which can occur with any set of pawns other than rook-pawns (with both Kings in front of their respective pawns), is known as a Trebucbet. There is not much to learn, since a glance will make things pretty clear: whoever moves is in zugzwang-he is forced to move away from the de fense of his pawn, which will result in an obviously lost King and pawn vs. lone King situation. Thus, if \Vhite has the move: 1 .Kh4 Kxf4 With black's King in front of his pawn, the win in easy.

Diagram 97 a b c d e g h White to move, what's going on? This is the kind of position that sends many players into a panic. Who is better? What in the world is going on? Is there anything to gasp onto that will enable us to make a quick and easy assessment? The idea of something defin able which can help us understand the right path in seemingly tough positions is an important one, and we'll be searching for such "crutches" all through this book. In the present case, that crutch is our basic Trebuchet-after the c-pawn and h-pawn are taken, the result will depend on who can force the other into zugzwang via Trebuchet. Since black's King will be closer to the two center pawns (meaning that he can make first contact), \Vhite will end up a loser in the coming battle. 1 .Kxh6 Kxc3 2.Kg5 Kd3 ! The key move! The obvious 2 . . .Kd4?? would be a game losing blunder since after 3.Kf5 Black would be on the sour side of the Trebuchet.

He could resign here, but we'll continue: 4.Kg4 Kxe4 5.Kg3 Ke3 (Not letting white's King get in front of the pawn.) 6.Kg4 e4 (Avoiding the embarrassing 6 . . .Kd2 ?? 7.Kf5, =) 7.Kg3 Kd2 followed by . . .e4-e3-e2-e l=Q. This example shows us that a firm grasp of the following rule can prove very useful indeed.

Though Trebuchets happen fairly often, far more common is the following type of situation: Diagram 98 a h c d e f g h Can White win? It doesn't matter who has the move since the e5-pawn falls in any case (\Vhite to move would play l .Kd6). The real question is, can \Vhite win after he captures black's final pawn? Using your understanding of King and pawn vs. lone King, you should be able to ascertain that the game is drawn since Black can get a position where white's King is in front of his pawn (which is good for \Vhite), but Black can gain the Opposition (which is good for Black) and hold the game. Let's give Black the first move: 1 . ..Kfi! The only way to draw! l . .. Ke7?? loses to 2 .Kxe5 (taking the Opposition!) 2 . . .Kf7 (or 2 . . .Kd7 3 . Kf6) 3 .Kd6 Ke8 (3 . . .Kf6 4.e5+ Kf7 5.Kd7) 4.Ke6 (Continuing to use the Opposition to push black's King away from the queening square. \Vhite can also win by 4.e5 Kd8 5.e6 Ke8 6.e7 Kf7 7.Kd7, etc.) 4 . . .Kd8 5.Kf7 Kd7 6.e5 and the pawn promotes.

Diagram 1 00 should help to clarify black's previous failure. In diagram 99, Black's King was not able to step backwards after the pawn reached e6 and, as a result, he lost. Here though, Black draws easily since he can step backwards and take the Opposition at will: l . .. Ke8 2 .Kd6 Kd8 3.Kd5 Ke7 4.Ke5 Ke8

There is a bit of an optical illusion in diagram 99, so carefully compare the last two positions until the "why" and "how" becomes clear. King and Two Doubled Pawns vs. Lone King King and two (doubled) pawns vs. lone King always win unless the pawns can't be properly defended, or unless they are rook-pawns. The defender's only hope lies in winning one of the two pawns, or in tricking the opponent into some lucky stalemate. Thus, when you have this two-pawn advantage, be very careful to avoid stalemate by making sure the enemy King always has a legal move. Diagram 1 0 1 : -:-:-:-:

However, White does have that extra pawn, and this makes all the difference. l l .g7+ Kg8 12.g3 This move, in effect, says, "Excuse me, but could you kindly move your King away from the front of my pawn?" 12 ...Kh7 1 3 .Kf7 and wins. Okay, that seemed simple enough, but why didn't \Vhite push both his g-pawns down the board at the same time? The answer is that doing so would increase black's chances for a stalemate (as illustrated in the next example). Diagram 1 02
[diagram]
White to move In our previous example, \Vhite only touched his extra g-pawn at the end. However, he could have pushed both, which might have led to this position. \Vhite still wins, but he has to be careful! l.g7+ Kg8 2.g5 Kh7 3 .g8+! Forced but adequate. Instead, 3 .Kf7?? draws by immediate stalemate! Note how the advanced g5-pawn restricts the movement of the enemy King and thus turns into a traitor. After 3 .g8+, \Vhite forces a winning King and pawn vs. lone King position. 3 . . . Kxg8 4.Kg6 Kh8 5.Kf7 Kh7 6.g6+ and wins.

Rook- Pawn (Stalemating the Stronger Side) I n general, in a King and pawn vs. lone King position, the weaker side loses if he can't get his King in front of the enemy pawn-if you can't block and stop the pawn from queening, then you're a goner! However, rook-pawns often al low all sorts of exceptions due to the fact that there isn't a file to the side of the pawn (which creates many odd stalemate possibilities). Dia gram 1 03 a h c d e f g h \Vhite wins If black's King stood on h8 and white's on h6, then the game would be an easy draw since the pawn won't ever be able to get past the blocking defensive King without giving stalemate. In the diagrammed position, though, the black King isn't blocking anything (in fact, white's King has a firm grasp on the critical h8-queening square) and has no way of stopping h4-h5-h6-h7-h8=Q. Thus, he might as well resign. Diagram 1 04

If \Vhite had the move, h e would simply play l .Kg7 and force resignation. However, Black to move draws with either 1 . . . Kf8 or 1 . . .Kf7. Let's take a look: 1 . . .Kf7 Keeping white's King cornered and thus forcing it to block its own pawn!
2.h5
Of course, 2 .Kh8 Kg6 followed by . . .Kh5 and . . . Kxh4 ends things immediately. 2 . . . Kf8 Actually, 2 . . . Kf6 would also draw since 3 .Kg8 Kg5 picks up the pawn, while 3 .h6 Kf7 takes us back into safe territory. Careful though! In general the de fender wants to keep his King on f8 and f7, which allows him to leap to g8 if allowed.
3.Kh8
By now you should know that the position after 3 .Kg6 Kg8 is hopelessly drawn. 3 . . . Kf7 4.h6 Kf8 Even faster is 4 . . . Kg6 5.h7 Kf7 stalemate!
5.Kh7
\Vhite's King is caught in a net and can't clear a path for his pawn! You might have noticed that 5.h7 Kf7 led to immediate stalemate and a draw. 5 ... Kf7 Not letting the snared white King out of its cage!
6.Kh8 Kf8 7.h7 Kf7 stalemate. This is a rare example of the side with no
pieces left stalemating the stronger side's King. Taking the position in diagram 104 and adding a second or even third h -pawn has absolutely no effect on the result: Diagram 1 05

Again, 7.Kg6 Kg8 is nothing for \Vhite. 7 ...Kf7 8.h7 Kf8 9.h6 Kf7 10.hS Kf8, stalemate! The final position deserves a diagram: Diagram 1 06 a h c d e f g h White to move, stalemate The position in diagram 1 06 should, once and for all, burn the lessons we've explored concerning rook-pawns deeply into your brain. Diagram 1 07 a h c d e f g h "X" marks the spot! This diagram should make it easy to know whether or not a King and rook pawn vs. lone King position is drawn. If the defender's King stands on any of
106 S I L M A N ' S C O M P L ET E E N D G A M E C O U R S E
the "X" squares the game will be a draw (the position of white's King won't change the result). Entering the Square of the Pawn \Vhen an enemy pawn is trying to outrace your King down the board, it's always nice to be able to see with a glance if you (or your opponent) can draw. Sadly, most players feel that they must do the old "he goes there and I go there" routine for an endless series of moves to see if their King can make it back in time to stop an unescorted enemy pawn. Fortunately, there is an easier way! Diagram 1 08
[diagram]
Black to move This position (diagram 108), in which white's King is far from the action, poses a simple question: Can black's King stop (or even win) the enemy pawn? The game hangs in the balance-if the black King can stop the pawn, then the game is drawn, while the game is lost if the King can't. The answer lies in a technique called the Square of the Pawn. Diagram 109 shows the same position as the previous one, but now the nor mally invisible Square of the Pawn is drawn and clear for all to see. How does one create such a square? Here's the trick (in the direction of the stalking King): Draw a diagonal extension from the pawn to the end of the board. Draw a rank extension from the side of the pawn to the file where the diagonal extension ended. In this case that would be the e-file since the diagonal extension ended at e8. Connect all the lines and you'll get the square in the diagram.

Black can't step into the Square Even if it's his move, Black can't step into this new square and thus can't stop the pawn. If all this seems confusing, think about it, try to move the King towards the pawn on your own board, and imagine the square shrinking each time the pawn moves. After a bit of time the whole Square of the Pawn idea will be an easy and natural part of your chess arsenal. Outside Passed Pawns In Part Three, we learned that many pawn endgames could be won by the Fox in the Chicken Coup technique. I didn't mention it then, but this is really just one example of the usefulness of an Outside Passed Pawn.
1 0 8 S I L M A N ' S C O M P L E T E E N D G A M E C O U R S E
What is an Outside Passed Pawn? It's a passed pawn that stands to the side of the main sphere of battle. Such a pawn is usually a very valuable commod ity since it can be far from the enemy King and thus pose a serious promotion threat, and/or it can force the defending King over to deal with it, leaving the embattled area (where most of the pawns reside) bereft of a defender. Diagram 1 1 1 a b c d e g h \Vhite wins White easily wins this position (it doesn't matter who has the move) thanks to his outside passed cl-pawn, which allows him to makes use of the Chicken Coup idea.
1.d5+ Kd6 2.Kd4
Black's King is now forced to relinquish control over the key e5-square. Why is e5 so important? Because this is a steppingstone square that takes White closer to the tasty morsels on g6 and h5 . 2 ...Kd7 3 .Ke5 Ke7 4.d6+ Kf7 Black's last stand. He didn't fancy 4 . . . Kd7 5.Kf6!

6.Ke6 Ke8 7.Kf6, 1 -0.
That was easy! But White started out with an extra pawn, so the result is hardly surprising. Can White use the Outside Passed Pawn in the same manner if material is even? Yes, he often can!

After 4 . . .Kxf6, black's King can step into the Square of white's c-pawn after 5.c6 Ke6. So, White should try: 5.Kd5 Ke7!

REMEMBER
An Outside Passed Pawn is a valuable endgame commodity. It can pose a serious promotion threat, and/or it can force the defending King over to deal with it, leaving the embattled area (where most of the pawns reside) bereft of a defender. Very few people study minor piece endgames, and this is certainly not the place to enter into the many complex situations that can occur when Bishops and Knights rule the board. However, the "C" class is an excellent place to dip your toes into shallow minor piece endgame waters. Don't worry, it will be painless and very useful, since the few positions we will explore all turn up regularly and allow you to save many situations that, at first glance, seem completely hopeless. Bishop and Wrong Colored Rook-Pawn vs. Lone King One of the most surprising and common "miracle-saves" features a position where White enjoys a Bishop and pawn vs. a lone King! This sounds like it should be resignable, yet it can be salvaged if The pawn is a rook-pawn. The pawn's queening square is a different color than its Bishop. The defender's King can reach the queening square (or any of the squares touching the queening square). This still sounds crazy, doesn't it? Let's take a look at a few Bishop and pawn vs. King positions and, before you know it, you'll soon completely understand the dynamics behind the miracle save mentioned above. Take a hard look at diagram 1 1 6. One would think that an extra Bishop and pawn should be child's play, and here they would be right! White wins because the rules just listed are not all present-his pawn isn't a rook-pawn. 1 1 2

Lone King vs. Knight and Rook-Pawn on the 6th or 7th We've just seen an important instance where a Bishop and pawn can't beat a lone King. Surely the flexible Knight is immune from such anomalies? One would think that a Knight and (safe) pawn would always beat a lone King, but there is one important exception! A Knight and a (safe) pawn vs. a lone King is always a win for the material advantage, except when the extra pawn is a rook-pawn and that rook-pawn is on the 7th rank. We've seen that rook-pawns often create exceptions to otherwise ironclad rules, and this is yet another case of the "rook-pawn curse." Our next example shows why the Knight and pawn win under normal circum stances (i.e., the pawn's not on the 7th rank). Diagram 1 2 0

Black is doomed, even though he has the move Even though white's King is in another time zone, Black has no chance at all in this position because the pawn can easily be protected by its Knight.

USEFUL ADVICE
When you have to guard your pawn with your Knight in this kind of endgame, it's usually correct to defend the pawn from behind and not from the front or the side (as we saw in the note to White's 2nd move). Why? Because an undefended Knight on the side or front allows the defending King to capture it and still be in a position where the pawn can be stopped. Capturing a Knight that's behind its pawn allows the pawn to turn into a Queen. 2 ...Kg6 3.Kc5 Kh7 Of course, 3 . . .Kg5 4.h7 leads to a new Queen for \\'bite.

It seems that the Knight's ability to control any colored square (unlike the Bishop's) assures the Knight and pawn victory over a lone King in all sane situations. However (as stated earlier) there is one trick situation that must be avoided (or played for, if you're the side in trouble).

Kh8 2.Ke6 Or 2 .Kf6 stalemate. 2 . . . Kg7 3.Kf5 Kh8 Again, Black welcomes 4.Kf6 or 4.Kg6, since both lead to an immediate draw by stalemate.
4.Kg4 Kg7 5.Kh5 Kh8 and again White can't approach the pawn via 6.Kg6
or 6.Kh6 since that would lead to immediate stalemate. The game is drawn since the pawn can't move, the Knight is stuck babysitting the pawn, and white's King can't touch its pawn without stalemating its evil counterpart. Many players don't see this coming, so add it to your arsenal of emergency endgame weapons! Bishops of Opposite Colors Tournament players love to bandy about the term "Bishops o fopposite colors," though they often don't really know much about this interplay of minor pieces. In the middlegame, Bishops of opposite colors is thought to be an advantage for the attacker since one Bishop can't defend what the other attacks. However, in the endgame Bishops of opposite colors can give the defender serious drawing chances in positions that one would think are losing. For example, a one-pawn advantage is often inadequate to score the full point.

Another easy draw White enjoys a dominating King position and an extra pawn. Nevertheless, Black draws in mindless fashion by moving his Bishop back and forth along the a l-h8 diagonal, trading pawns whenever the opportunity presents itself, and finally giving up his Bishop for the final enemy pawn.

Diagram 1 2 4 a h c d e f g h Time to shake hands This position shows one of the main problems the stronger side faces when Bishops of opposite colors exists: the passed pawn on e6 is firmly blocked by black's King and white's light-squared Bishop is unable to influence anything on that color. Thus, it can't make the King step away from its blockade, nor can it attack black's kingside pawns! Black draws by keeping his King planted on e7, and by keeping his Bishop on the a 1 -h8 diagonal. In this way, the passed pawn on e6 will never get anywhere, the h6-pawn is defended by the other pawn, and the g7-pawn is firmly (and permanently) guarded by its Bishop. Again, mindless "back and forth" action by . . .Bal -Bb2-Bal -Bb2 is all it takes to split the point. We'll continue our look at Bishops of opposite colors in Part Five.
USEFUL ADVICE
When you are in trouble, an excellent "last stand" strategy is to trade into a Bishops of opposite colors' position. Most players feel helpless when they enter a Rook endgame. This is quite unfortunate since Rook endgames occur often-in fact, they are more common than any other kind of endgame. One thing that keeps players from studying such endgames is their apparent complexity. Who can understand and/or memorize such things? Which endgames are important, and which ones are complete wastes of time? Here we'll begin our Rook endgame education with two must know positions: The Lucena Position and the Philidur Position. Are they hard to understand? Do they take hours of effort to master? No, the basics of the Lucena and the Philidor can be completely assimilated in thirty minutes to an hour. In return, you'll find they occur remarkably often, and they will both serve as lifelong guideposts on how to handle all other, far more complex, Rook endgames. The Lucena Position {The Sacred Key to All Rook Endings) It's time to learn (yes, you will completely master this particular ending in the next few minutes!) the Holy Grail of Rook endings; the sacred key that allows you to know what to avoid when defending a pawn down Rook endgame, while also giving you the knowledge to know what to head for if you have the superior side. ' "
USEFUL ADVICE
This is one of those bits of chess knowledge that every serious player must possess. It's that important. The Lucena Position, first published in 1634 by Salvio (for some reason it wasn't in an earlier book by Lucena), is a simplified position where one side has a Rook and a non rook-pawn on the 7th rank (the King in front of its pawn), while the other side just has a Rook. The position in diagram 1 2 5 shows us the particulars. 1 2 1

Diagram 1 2 5
[diagram]
\Vhite to move White wins no matter who has the move, though for clarity's sake we'll give White the move here. The key feature of the Lucena is the extra pawn on the 7th rank, one square away from turning into a Queen. Also, both Kings are joined in battle, with the white King in front of his pawn and the enemy King as close to the area of battle as possible. Clearly, White needs to do two things if he wants to win: --� Move his King off of d8 so he can push his pawn. Promote the pawn to a Queen. Simple goals indeed, but is it really that easy? Of course not! The problem is that white's King is blocking his own pawn and, at the moment, the black King and Rook are preventing it from getting out of the way. Since the black Rook can't be budged, White must make the black King give ground. The first way to try and accomplish this goal is: l .Re7 +? (Many players try this, but it simply doesn't get the job done.) l . . .Kf8 (And not l . . .Kf6?? 2 .Ke8 followed by 3 .d8=Q with an instant win.) 2 .Re8+ Kf7 3 .Re7+ Kf8. White is getting nowhere fast. Since this fails, White should play: 1 .Rf2+!

Making black's King leave the scene of battle This is far more to the point! Since 1 . . . Ke6?? allows 2.Ke8 followed by 3.d8=Q, Black has to step to the side and give the white King room to wander. 1 . . .Kg7 Now comes a key moment. Of the following moves, which one do you think is correct?
2.Ke8

This is the move almost every one tries! 2 ...Rel+ 3.Kd6 It seems the White King is at last free to roam. This is true, hut its in ability to support its pawn in the face of the upcoming relentless barrage of enemy checks makes the whole idea invalid. 3 ...Rdl+ 4.Ke6 And not 4.Ke5 ??

6.Ke6 Rel+ and \Vhite is again making no progress.
Wrong:
2.Rg2+?
This silly move helps Black by allowing him to move back to f7, once again rendering the white King immobile. Thus, the right move for \Vhite is:
2.Rf4!

A mysterious rook move This certainly looks odd, doesn't it? However, the idea of using the Rook to shelter its King from upcoming checks makes sense. The legendary Nimzovich described this maneuver as "building a bridge."

The "Building a Bridge" maneuver is the winning idea in a Lucena Position. Let's see how it works: 2 . . .Rc2 Black can't improve his position so he marks time. 3 .Ke7 Only now should the white King leave the cover of the pawn. Since promotion is threatened, Black must go into checking mode. 3 . . .Re2+ 4.Kd6 Rd2+ 5.Ke6 Don't toss the win out the window with 5.Ke5?? Rxd7, draw. 5 ...Re2+ 6.Kd5 Rd2+ 7.Rd4!

We can now sum up the winning ideas: Force the black King away from the action via Rf2 +. Prepare to use your Rook as a check-blocking ("bridge building") agent with Rf 4. Move your King away from the front of the pawn. Block the opponent's desperate checks with the Rook, which effectively ends the game. Congratulations! You have now mastered the Lucena Position.

The Philidor Position (A Critical Defensive Stand ! ) Now that you've mastered the Lucena Position (You did master that position, didn't you?), we will take a look at something that's almost as important: the Philidor Position. Okay, who can remember such strange names? Fair enough. Let's follow the old adage that says a picture is worth a thousand words. Di agram 1 3 0

Draw White's a pawn up, enjoys the superior King position, and apparently has the more active Rook. Though I just listed three serious plusses for White, this is a dead draw. However, people lose this kind of position every day, so you must know what you're doing. Fortunately, the drawing idea is very simple, and by the time you finish reading the material about the Philidor in Part Four, you'll be able to draw any grandmaster in the world with ease. We'll return to the position in diagram 1 3 0 soon, but first let's take a look at some things that can go wrong for the defender. Passive Rook Though a Phildor Position should be drawn, things can turn ugly if the defender's Rook becomes passively placed, giving the stronger side free reign to do whatever he wishes to do.

Black's passive rook leads to his doom In diagram 1 3 1 , White wins because black's Rook is stuck on his 1 st rank (moving the Rook off the 1st rank allows Rh8+ ). Since black's Rook is a bystander and can't bother the white King, the first player can calmly play l.Ra7! when 2 .Ra8+ can't be stopped. Black would then have to resign.

Diagram 1 32 a h c d e f g h Different pawn, but Black's still dead White scores the point by using that same "swing the Rook to the other side" technique: l.Ra7 Kb8 (Not a happy choice, but 2.Ra8 mate had to be stopped. If 1 . . . Kd8 2.Ra8+ picks up black's Rook.) 2.c7+ Kc8 3.Ra8+ Kd7 4.Rxg8 and Black might be well advised to resign and find something better to do with his time. Sometimes, though, you can play horribly and still exit with your skin intact. In diagram 1 3 3 , Black has allowed his Rook to become passive, but it doesn't matter because White can't win if he's left with a knight-pawn or rook-pawn.

RULE
If your opponent's extra pawn is a knight-pawn or rook-pawn and your King is in front of it, you should effortlessly draw even if the lobotomy scar hasn't completely healed yet. Diagram 1 3 3
[diagram]
Black draws despite himself! If only White could swing his Rook over to the file left of the a-file! Sadly, such a file doesn't exist. Because of this, White can't force a catastrophic back rank check (as occurred in diagram 1 3 1 after l .Ra7) and, as a result, can't win the game: 1 .Rb7+ Ka8 2 .Ra7+ Kb8 and no progress can be made since 3 .b7?? Rg6+ wins for Black!
REMEMBER
; These kinds of passive Rook positions a re winning for the stronger side if the pawn (which i is on the 6th rank) is a bishop-pawn, queen-pawn, or king-pawn (thanks to the possibility of swinging the Rook over to the other side). However, a knight-pawn or rook-pawn is hopelessly drawn, since this "swing the Rook over" maneuver is no longer possible. Pure Philidor Having taken a look at the key passive Rook positions, it's finally time to return to the position in diagram 1 30 (recreated for your viewing pleasure in diagram 1 34) and study a basic Philidor Position in all its glory.

Remember how I promised that you would be able to draw any grandmaster with ease from this position? I wasn't joking! The big idea here is to take away the whole 6th rank from the white King: 1 ...Rh6! Believe it or not, this simple move ices the draw. Black was aware that passive play failed due to our old "swinging Rook crouch ing check" trick: 1 . . .Rf7 ("Why let White check our King?" is a common line of reasoning. But stopping such a check turns out to be unrealistic after . . .) 2.Ra8! when Ra7+ can't be prevented. But why didn't Black play for the active Rook by 1 . . . Rhl (threatening to check on dl)? Because after 2.Rg7+ Ke8 White has the strong 3.Kd6!. Diagram 1 3 5 a b c d e g h Not what Black wants!
USEFUL ADVICE
The idea of blocking checks by using the pawn as cover is a big one, and Black must do his best to avoid this pitfall. .t . 44 t aa: 11 a o. r a :zq; Suddenly Black can't maintain a cascade of checks since 3 ...Rh6+ runs into 4.e6 (using the pawn to block the check and threatening Rg8 mate) when 4 . . .Rh8 leads to the lost passive Rook positions already discussed in diagrams 1 3 1 and 1 3 2. Also note that 3 ...Rd l + fails to 4.Ke6 when the checks are over and Rg8+ is once again "on." By the way, the position in diagram 1 3 5 turns out to be drawn after all, but it's far from easy and is anything but "basic." Look for a discussion of this in Part Seven, where Black faces his fears and survives against impossible odds. For our purpose (i.e., proving that the Philidor Position is an easy draw), we'll say that you would be smart to avoid the position in diagram 1 3 5. Fortunately, playing 1 . . . Rh6! (from diagram 1 34) makes life good (and easy!) again.

"You shall not pass!" shouts the black Rook to the white King The "deep" defensive idea (also known as the 3rd Rlznk Defense) is now clear. If left alone, Black will bravely play . . . Rh6 and . . . Rg6 until the cows come home (or wrist-cramp sets in). Of course, if Black lusts for adventure then he can toss in . . .Rb6 (a "longer" and more flowery move), but it all amounts to the same thing: white's King desperately wants to step forward but can't due to the blocking power of the black Rook!
4.e6
Not what White wanted to play, but he has no other choices since 4.Ra8+ Ke7 makes Black happy. Now White threatens the strong Kd6 when black's King will feel some serious heat. 4 .. .Rgl ! Only now does this active move work. Since white's King can't hide behind his pawn any longer, the upcoming avalanche of checks makes the draw obvious. D iagram 1 37

I strongly recommend that you ponder the ideas in this very common endgame. These themes will help you save games when down a pawn and win games when you possess that extra bit against an unschooled opponent.
RULE
The defender's drawing plan in the Philidor Position is to use his Rook to block the stronger side's King from stepping onto the rank in front of the pawn. Go back and forth with the Rook until the pawn is pushed (destroying the enemy King's pawn cover). Then leap to the back rank (putting maximum distance between the defending Rook and enemy King) and begin checking like a berserk demon! . ;; . tut. a ;; us tt I Jii. t W$4i. ttiL Qi .a 4, ..

Thanks to the extra pawn and the fact that black's King is so far away, White is clearly winning the game. Black is still holding on to some small shred of hope, though. If he can get his King in front of the pawn he might (Ah, the joy of hope!) be able to create a Philidor Position. However, why should White allow Black to hold onto his dreams when he can immediately show black's helpless ness by the simple 1.Rfl! Suddenly black's King has no hope of taking part in the battle since l . . .Rf7 2 .Rxf7+ is a very easy win. Our next example shows this "trapping the King away from the action" idea used defensively.
USEFUL ADVICE
Trapping the enemy King away from the action for either defensive or offensive reasons is often a very effective strategy. Diagram 1 3 9 White to move would win by 1 .Kc5 when the d5-pawn would fall: l .Kc5 Rg5 2 . Rd6+ Ke7 3.Rxd5. However, Black to move saves the game by . . . 1 . . .Rc8!

Without a King, White can't hope to win. Drawn. This is a no-contest, especially if the stronger side's King-who we'll suppose is White-is close to the pawn. However, even if the white King is on the other end of the universe, a Queen can beat a King and pawn (occasional exceptions occur if the pawn is on the 7 th rank) in two ways: The Queen lands on the queening square. Since the pawn then has no chance of promoting, the vacationing King can calmly walk back to the endangered area and eventually eat the pawn. --� The Queen forces the black King to step in front of its pawn.

However, he can win easily in the following manner: 1 .Qg5+ Khl 1 . . . Kh2 blocks the pawn and let's White safely move his King closer to the action by 2.Kc7 .

This endgame is won by maneuvering with the Queen so that black's King is forced to step in front of its pawn.

a h c d e f g h White to move, draw Black's drawing idea in this endgame can be instantly grasped after l .Qg3+ Khl ! , when the hoped for march of the White King (via 2 .Kc7, for example) leads to an immediate stalemate and draw. Unfortunately for White, Queen checks also get nowhere: 2 .Qe l+ Kg2 3 .Qd5+ Kgl (and not 3 . . .Kg3?? 4.Qh l , winning) and the threat to promote the pawn means that white's King will never be able to help out. Thus the game's a draw. A rook-pawn (a/h-pawn) on the 7th rank draws against a Queen if the stronger side's King is far from the action. King and Pawn Endgames _.,..In general, in a king and pawn vs. lone King position, the weaker side loses if he can't get his King in front of the enemy pawn-if you can't block and stop the pawn from queening, then you're a goner! However, rook-pawns often allow all sorts of exceptions due to the fact that there isn't a file to the side of the pawn (which creates many odd stalemate possibilities). � You can gauge the result of an upcoming Trebuchet position in this way: the side whose King can make first contact with the enemy pawn can force a winning Trebuchet. _.,..King and two (doubled) pawns vs. lone King always win unless the pawns can't be properly defended, or unless they are rook-pawns. _.,..You can calculate the square of a pawn by: drawing a diagonal extension from the pawn to the end of the board; drawing a line from the side of the pawn to the edge of the board; connecting all the lines. The defender's King can step into this square, it will stop the pawn. If it can't, the pawn will run for a touchdown. _.,..An Outside Passed Pawn is a passed pawn that stands to the side of the main sphere of battle. Such a pawn is usually a very valuable commodity since it can be far from the enemy King and thus pose a serious promotion threat, and/or it can force the defending King over to deal with it, leaving the embattled area (where most of the pawns reside) bereft of a defender. Minor Piece Endgames _.,..A Bishop and (safe) pawn vs. a lone King sounds like it should be resignable, yet it can be salvaged if the pawn is a rook-pawn; the pawn's queening square is a different color than its Bishop; the defender's King can reach the queening square (or any of the squares touching the queening square). _.,..A Knight and a (safe) pawn vs. a lone King is always a win for the material advantage, except when the extra pawn is a rook-pawn and 1 3 9

that rook-pawn is on the 7 th rank. We've seen that rook-pawns often create exceptions to otherwise ironclad rules, and this is yet another case of the "rook-pawn curse." _.,..In the middle game, Bishops of opposite colors is thought to be an advantage for the attacker since one Bishop can't defend what the other attacks. However, in the endgame Bishops of opposite colors can give the defender serious drawing chances in positions that one would think are losing. Rook Endgames _.,..The Lucena Position is the Holy Grail of Rook endings; the sacred key that allows you to know what to avoid when defending a pawn down Rook endgame, while also giving you the knowledge to know what to head for if you have the superior side. The Lucena Position is a simplified position where one side has a Rook and a pawn (any pawn but a rook-pawn) on the 7th rank (the King in front of its pawn), while the other side just has a Rook. _.,. The Philidor Position is a Rook and pawn vs. Rook position where the defender's King is in front of the enemy pawn. In general, such a position is drawn. _.,..In a Rook and pawn endgame, it's important to not allow your Rook to become passively placed! _.,..In a Rook and pawn endgame, always trap the enemy King as far away from the action as possible by using your Rook to cut it off from a file or rank. The logic is easy to grasp: If a heated battle is raging on Hill One, and a portion of the enemy army is confined to Hill Two, then you simply have your opponent outnumbered! Queen vs. King and Lone Pawn _.,..Queen vs. lone pawn is a no-contest, especially if the stronger side's King is close to the pawn. However, even if the stronger side's King is on the other end of the universe, a Queen can beat a King and pawn (occasional exceptions occur if the pawn is on the 7th rank) in two ways: • The Queen lands on the queening square.

Since the pawn can't move for a moment, the stronger side's King can take a safe step closer to the pawn's position. This will be repeated until the King joins with its Queen to pick off the pawn. � Queen vs. pawn observations (with the stronger side's King far from the action): A Queen vs. any pawn on the 6th always wins for the Queen; A Queen vs. a knight-pawn, king-pawn, queen-pawn on the 7th wins for the Queen; A Queen vs. a bishop-pawn or rook-pawn on the 7th is a draw.

SOLUTION 3 Diagram 1 48 a h c d e f � h Gereben - Najdorf, Budapest 1 936 Black to move White has a dominating King, two active Bishops vs. a Bishop and Knight, and two extra pawns. Is it time to resign? In the actual game, Black more or less gave up by playing 1 . . .N d5 2 .g4 Bd 7 3 .f5+ and he went down in flames. Later Najdorf received some (unjust) criti cism for missing a "saving" resource:
1... Nd7+ 2.Kd6 Nxc5 3.Kxc5 Bxh3 and now 4.gxh3 Kf5 draws since, after
. . .Kxf4, White will be left with a Bishop and wrong colored rook-pawn (5.Kd6 Kxf4 6.Bxc6 Kg5 7.Ke7 Kh6 8.Kf8 Kh7 and Black safely makes it to h8). This example shows how a player must always be on the lookout for the Bishop and rook-pawn of the wrong color save. However, in this example White wins after 3 . . .Bxh3 by 4.Bc2+!, which forces immediate resignation (4 . . .Bf5 5.Bxf5+ Kxf5 6.g3). SOLUTION 4 Diagram 1 49 a. h c d e f v, h White to move What is white's best move? White has made the mistake of pushing his doubled pawns down the board together.

This allows White to grab the Opposition and reach a basic winning King and pawn vs. King position. Other moves throw the win away: l .Kf7? ? is an immediate stalemate, while l .g6+?? Kg8 forces White to give up on g7-pawn and accept a basic draw. l . . .Kxg8 2.Kg6! And not 2 .g6?? Kf8 3 .g7+ Kg8 4.Kg6 stalemate. 2 . . .Kh8 3 .Kfi Kh7 4.g6+ and the pawn queens.

Though White wins the final black pawn, his King will end up trapped in the corner, or he'll allow the enemy King to take up residence on g8 or h8. l .Kg7 On 1 .h6 Black simply waits with l . . . Kd6 when 2 .Kg7 Ke7 3 .Kxh7 Kf7 traps white's King and forces a draw after 4.Kh8 Kf8 and now 5 .h 7 is an instant stale mate, while 5.Kh7 Kf7 gets White nowhere. l . . .

Other moves lose: 1 . . .Re8 2 .Bc8 and White makes a new Queen. l . . . Rb8 2 .Kc6 Rxb7 (2 . . .Ka5 3 .Kc7 Rxb7+ 4.Kxb7 a6 5.Bc4 and Black loses his a-pawn) 3 .Bc4+! (3 .Bc8??

First, both pawn majorities seem frozen by a single enemy pawn. Second, even if White achieves a Chicken Coup infiltration, he'll be left with a rook-pawn. However, it turns out that White can easily create a passed pawn, while Black can't. Once that is done, the race is on, with White winning by one move. 1 .c5+! A nice idea.

Instead, Black can effortlessly hold a half point by using the classic Philidor formula. t . . .Rg6! 2.Ra7+ Ke8 Now white's King can't advance onto the 6th rank. Since Black can endlessly tread water by moving his Rook back and forth along that rank, \Vhite must eventually push his e-pawn.

After l . . .

This example, which deserves careful study, is a mix of several things we've already learned (or should have already learned!): Opposition, Chicken Coup, Trebuchet, freezing a pawn majority, Square of the Pawn, and Outside Passed Pawns. A student of mine, who had the black pieces, showed me this game because he was very curious about the resulting King and pawn ending. He's a pawn up and doing well, but the move he chose left me clutching my heart in con vulsive agony. 1 . . .g6?? Turning a win into a loss in one move!

With 4.a5, White creates an Outside Passed Pawn that's even further from the action than the one that would result from 4.b5+. Ultimately it doesn't make a difference in this particular game, but often a little detail like this (i.e., dragging the black King even farther from the action on the kingside) can be the only way to win. 4 ...

However, you now have an extremely solid endgame base that puts you far ahead of most of your competition, and even ahead of players a few hundred rating points higher than you that should have mastered these endgames long ago, but never got around to it. Trust me when I tell you that the time you've spent learning everything in Part Four will likely prove to be the most rewarding study time of your chess life. You'll see the effects both in your newfound confidence, and in the results you gain against people who were once your equals, but now are not i n your league once an endgame is reached. Even ifyou decide that you have no desire to ever go past Part Four, do your self a favor: if you don't view King and pawn vs. King positions as kid stuff, if any mention of the Square of the pawn and Outside Passed Pawns makes your eyes roll up into your head, if you have even a shred of doubt about how to handle the Lucena and Philidor positions, if the winning procedure in a Queen vs. pawn on the 7th situation is something you have to ponder, please go back and read Part Four again. Do so over and over until everything in it is muscle memory-your mind might go blank, but your hand will reach out and play these positions perfectly. 1 5 8 ... ...!; ..._ ..._ ._, ::r-.:.���.1.�1'il>I �· �· -.1.lliJi'.tt•;,1,,, . .· ·. . ... . .. �;� ' =7

. \Jp fter slogging through the seemingly endless expanse of Part Four, you should suddenly possess more endgame knowledge than you might have thought possible. Now, as a "B" player, we're ready to finish up the "basics" and leave you lording it over the unschooled masses-the fact is, few other non-Russian "B" players will know what you know (they should have learned this information, but they didn't). I must admit that when I scaled the rating list and finally hit 1 600, I ignorantly thought I knew all the endgames that I would ever need. The reality was that I only knew about forty percent of the material that encompasses the first five parts of this book. Now that I have a lifetime of teaching experience, it's become clear to me that most players under 1 800 know even less, as proved by their many unnecessary defeats-losses that often occur as soon as an endgame appears. \Vhy throw away games in this fashion when the easy task of learning the material through Part Five will allow you to dominate others in your new (''B") rating class in most endgame situations? Not only that, but if you have a goal of reaching class "A" or Expert, knowing this material is an absolute must. Compared to the ocean of information in Part Four, the lessons here will seem "a walk in the park!" In fact, most of Part Five's lessons are merely tune-ups and add-ons to the endgame skills you've already assimilated. At this point you have a wealth of knowledge about King and pawn endgames. You know the importance of using your King, all forms of Opposition, the Square of the Pawn, the strength of Outside Passed Pawns, Fox in the Chicken Coup, all aspects of King and pawn vs. King situations, the drawish tendencies of rook-pawns, the ins and outs of Trebuchet, and quite a bit more. It's now time to solidify your grasp of King and pawn basics. The following material will enable you to play most King and pawn endgames with some real skill, and set you up for the more detailed knowledge that's re quired of players in the "A," Expert, and Master categories. King and Two Healthy Pawns vs. Lone King We've already seen (in Part Four) that a King and two safe doubled pawns (non rook-pawns!) win against a lone King. With that in mind, it's logical to assume that two non-doubled pawns should be even more decisive. Indeed, such situations are usually trivial wins, but there are two cases the might pose problems to the uninitiated: Split pawns Connected pawns When you are two pawns up, the only way your opponent will survive is if you blunder into a stalemate, or if one of your pawns is lost. This "lost pawn" scenario usually occurs when the stronger side's King is far from the action, leaving the poor pawns to fend for themselves. 1 6 1

Jfi_j ,ZM.3444 £ £4., itQZU:tQ2££W To sum up our observations about self-defending (Kingless) pawns: Connected pawns always defend each other. Pawns that are one file apart on any rank can usually defend themselves until the King arrives to shuttle one of them down the board. --� The defender has his best survival chances if the pawns are two files apart. However, if those pawns are on the 5th rank or farther then the game is resignable unless one of the pawns can be instantly captured: Pawns that are three files or more apart (on any rank) are too much for the defending King to handle. Two connected passed pawns vs. a lone King almost always wins easily. The only time connected pawns pose a problem is if one of them is a rook-pawn.

Triangulation Triangulation i s a seemingly complicated term that makes a chess player seem intellectually superior to everyone else when he says, "I won because I Triangulated my King, gained the Opposition, and ultimately left my opponent in zugzwang." Very impressive indeed! The fact of the matter is that Triangulation's the name of a very small, often uncomplicated maneuver designed to give your opponent the move and, as a result, you the Opposition. But don't pass this on to the non-chess playing public-why not let them continue to think that chess players are geniuses? The position in diagram 1 75 is our first realistic multi-pawn King endgame. And it looks complicated too! But the result really boils down to two questions: Can \\'bite win black's e-pawn?

Okay, that was simple enough. But now let's see if we get the same result if \\'bite moves first. Diagram 1 7 7 a b c d e g h White to move Many people would play l .Ke3 ?? here, but after 1 . . .Ke5 Black takes the Opposition and forces \\'bite backwards: 2.Ke2 Kf4 and white's pawns fall like ducks in hunting season. Clearly, the direct approach is a horrible failure in our diagrammed position. However, \\'bite can turn the tables by playing l .Kd2 or l .Kf2 , when l . . .Ke5 2 .Ke3 leaves \\'bite in possession of the Opposition. Both Kd2 and Kf2 are Triangulation maneuvers-\\'hite steps to the side, then moves diagonally for ward to create a small triangle. Believe it or not, that's what Triangulation (in its most basic form) is all about. So let's see \\'bite, with correct play, win from diagram 1 77: 1 .Kf2 ! By the way, this move also takes the Indirect Opposition, while l .Kd2 ! would take Distant Opposition. 1 . .. e3+! The best try. As stated earlier, 1 . . .Ke5 2 .Ke3 is an easy win for \\'bite.

RULE Basic Triangulation is a maneuver where the King steps to the side and then moves forward diagonally, thus losing a move and gaining the Opposition. Outflanking Ouiflanking i s a simple but useful tool to know. With i t a player can make inroads into a position that were not otherwise possible. Admittedly, this often costs the Opposition, but it must be remembered that the Opposition is only a means to an end, not the end itself!
RULE
Outflanking is a maneuver where the stronger side's King moves to the side, placing a file between the Kings (sometimes even giving the opponent the Opposition while doing so! ). This allows the Outflanking King to march forward towards the target. without allowing the enemy monarch to step in front of it and take Direct Opposition. Diagram 1 7 8

White to move and reach f8, g8, or h8 by force! Believe it or not, a close study of this position and its correct handling will teach the student the finer points of Opposition, Outflanking, and Triangula tion. \\'bite to play has the Opposition. His goal is to reach f8, g8 or h8 in at most seventeen moves. Black will constantly try to stop this, using Opposition (i.e., the threat to retake the Opposition) as a defensive device.

Once you've mastered this position and the techniques involved, we'll say that you have earned your "King diploma."
1.Ka2!
The only way to take the Opposition. The more direct path fails because it allows Black to take the Opposition: l .Kb2 ?? Kb8! (It is already impossible to reach the target squares.) 2 .Kc3 Kc7 3 .Kd4 Kd6 4.Ke4 Ke6 and White will not get close to his targets. 1 . ..Kh8! A fine defensive move! Now 2.Ka3? loses the Opposition since Black has his choice of two squares on the a-file and thus can make it either odd or even (2 . . .Ka7 !). White will also fail to reach his goals after 2 .Kb3 ?

3.Kc2
Still heading for the kingside. Instead White could try to Outflank Black, but at the moment this would fail to achieve the set goal. Let's look at an example of Outflanking by having White play 3 .Ka3 instead of the superior 3 .Kc2 : Diagram 1 79
[diagram]
White plays 3 .Ka3 instead of the correct 3 .Kc2
P A R T F I V E - E N D G A M E S F O R C L A S S " B " ( 1 6 0 0 - 1 7 9 9 ) 1 7 5
By putting a file between the Kings, White prevents Black from taking Direct Opposition while simultaneously making forward progress. This process is called Outflanking. After 3 .Ka3 Black can take the Opposition with 3 . . .Kc7 (forming connecting points on c7, c3 , a3 and a7) but White will be able to move forward:
4.Ka4 Kc6 5.Ka5 Kc5 6.Ka6 Kc6. White has managed to make inroads into
black's position, but he will never be able to get over to the kingside. To solve the problem posed in diagram 1 78, White must first go to the target side of board (kingside) and only then Outflank his opponent. The logic for this is easy to understand: when you are on the kingside, any forward motion will allow White to land on his goal squares. Back to the position after 3 .Kc2 : Diagram 1 80 a h c d e f g h Black to move 3 . . .

The Outflanking process finally takes place. 8 ... Kg7 Black could take the Opposition by 8 . . . Kh7 but after 9.Kf4 Kh6 10.KfS Kh5 l 1 .Kf6 White would be able to conquer the target square on f8. This idea of giving up the Opposition for a higher prize is a major part of Outflanking.

Don't let the scientific names or the strange Xs in diagram l 78 scare you away from learning something that is both easy to understand and highly useful! I should add that the position in diagram 1 78 is a fun one to show friends. They will not be able to solve it and will be amazed when you demonstrate how one King can actually be stronger than another just by understanding the basics of the Opposition and Outflanking. Ready to take another step in deepening your understanding of Rook end game basics? Here we'll look at how one goes about winning with a Rook and two connected passed pawns vs. a lone Rook. We'll settle for this one position because, though it sounds easy, it's actually quite a pain to win ! Rook and Two Connected Pawns vs. Rook A Rook endgame where one side is up two connected passed pawns is usually, as you might imagine, a clear win. Surprisingly, it can be quite time consuming and success is often dependent on you knowing the key ideas, and on you avoid ing the many stalemate tricks that are lurking in the shadows. This endgame occurs quite a lot, and therefore the ideas involved in herding your pawns safely down the board must be mastered. A word of warning: You'll find this to be the most complicated situation in the book thus far, so look over the information slowly, and don't get frustrated. It will take you a bit of time before you fully master it! Diagram 1 8 1 a h c d e f g h White to move Connected rook-pawns and knight-pawns is the hardest case.

Also, make sure your King and pawns are in close contact. As in most chess situations, a team effort is needed for a successful result. In the present position, white's h-pawn is ahead of the rest of its forces.

Sometimes white's King will march to f6 when a black check along the 6th rank can be met by Re6. --� Once white's g-pawn gets to g6, a back rank mate will be threatened. To stop this, Black will have to pull his Rook to its 1 st rank. \\'bite then wins by marching his King to t7 or d7 and trading Rooks by Re8+. The resulting King and two pawns vs. King endgame would then give Black every reason to resign. Don't panic if this sounds too complicated!

Make sure your King and pawns are in close contact. As in most chess situations, a team effort is needed for a successful result. Make sure that your pawns can shield your King from checks!

Be patient! Push the enemy King back slowly, always making sure the above conditions have been met. Once you have forced the enemy King to the back rank, move your Rook (which should be on the 7th rank) a couple files to the side of your pawns. Your plan now is to:
WARNING
Place both your pawns on the 6th rank (forcing black's Rook to guard against back rank mates). Bring your King to the 7th rank-your Rook on the 7th will prevent checks along that rank. Give check by moving your Rook (protected by your King on the 7th rank!) to the 8th rank, forcing an exchange. The resulting King and two pawns vs. lone King endgame should be baby stuff for you at this point. Only move your h-pawn to h7 if you are 1 00% sure you have prevented the many stalemate tricks that are so commonly found in these positions! Don't forget the need for (yes, I'm repeating myself) patience ! With all this in mind, go back, play through the endgame again, and it will make more sense. All Hail the 7th Rank! Everyone has heard that "Rooks belong on the 7th rank." However, can you explain why a Rook isn't equally delighted to be on the 6th rank or even the 8th? The appeal of the 7th rank is twofold: ••� Usually the enemy has many pawns on his 2nd rank, so placing a Rook on the 7th targets them for extermination . --� The defender's King is often on its 1 st rank. A Rook on the 7th freezes the King, preventing it from becoming active and-in some instances-setting up possible back rank mating threats.

We took our first tentative steps into the world of minor piece endgames in Part Four. Here I'll continue to gently introduce you to basic endgame positions that involve Bishops and/or Knights-we'll ingest a bit more about Bishops of opposite colors, we'll tackle very basic two pawns vs. one on the same side of the board, and we'll even address two Bishops vs. lone King, which is far easier than you might imagine. Two Bishops vs. Lone King Some of you might be wondering when I'm going to teach you Bishop and Knight vs. lone King. The shocking (almost heretical!) answer is, "Never!" My reasoning is very simple: I personally have had this position once in my whole career. That's right, just once ! My good friend (and well known chess author) IM John Watson has never had it at all! On top of that, Bishop and Knight vs. King is not at all easy to learn, and mastering it would take a significant chunk of time. Should the chess hopeful really spend many of the precious hours he's put aside for chess study learning an endgame that he'll achieve (at most) only once or twice in his lifetime? In general, every position I give in this book will happen fairly often, or un derstanding it will allow you to solve other positions with similar themes. I don't feel Bishop and Knight vs. King falls into this category, but then, two Bishops vs. King is also a rare bird in tournament play. So why should I insist you learn two Bishops vs. lone King? There are three reasons for its inclusion: I find the need to use all three of your pieces in a balanced team effort to be quite instructive. Seeing how powerful two Bishops are when working together can be enlightening. It's very easy to learn and only involves a small expenditure of time to fully understand. 1 8 8

Bishops of Opposite Colors (Two Pawns Down and Loving it! ) In Part Four, we saw that a one-pawn advantage is often not enough to guaran tee victory. At times, a two-pawn advantage (with no other pawns on the board) isn't enough when there is only one file between them. The reason? White's King and Bishop can team up to blockade both pawns.

However, when the pawns are two or more files from each other the stronger side's winning chances go way up. There are many cases of White winning when the pawns are two files apart, but the defender does have drawing chances if his Bishop can freeze both pawns at the same time.

Since 1 .Kd4 (threatening 2 .e4) is stymied by l . . .Kf5 ! 2.Kc5 Ke6 when the Bishop is still stopping both pawns in their tracks, White comes up with the idea of bringing his King to a6 in an effort to help escort the b-pawn to the Promised Land.

As usual in Bishop endgames, watch out for the old wrong colored rook- pawn trick. 1ws t . t , μ;;;JU41$J r a h c d e f g h Black draws Black draws easily by rushing over to b7 and allowing White to win a piece for his g-pawn. 1 .Kh6 Kc6 2.Kh7 Kh7 3 .g7 Ka8 4.g8=Q Bxg8+ 5.Kxg8 and we have the classic Bishop and rook-pawn of the wrong color draw. In a nutshell, when one side is two pawns up (vs. lone King and Bishop) in a Bishop of opposite color endgame, here are some rules to chew on: Positions where the pawns are separated by one file are often drawn since the defending Bishop and King are close enough to work together in creating a blockade against both pawns. Positions where the pawns are separated by two files off er some drawing chances, particularly if the defending Bishop __ ._ eyes the advance squares of both pawns at the same time. Positions where the pawns are separated by three or more files offer few defensive chances. However, a draw is likely if one of the pawns is a rook-pawn of the wrong color. King and Pawn Endgames _.,..King and two connected pawns vs. lone King always wins. _.,..King and two split pawns vs. lone King: • Pawns that are one file apart on any rank can usually defend themselves until the King arrives to shuttle one of them down the board. • Pawns that are several files apart (on any rank) are too much for the defending King to handle. • The defender has his best survival chances if the pawns are two files apart. However, if those pawns are on the 5th rank or farther then the game is resignable. _.,..Triangulation is the name of a very small, often uncomplicated maneuver designed to give your opponent the move and, as a result, you the Opposition. _.,..Outflanking is a maneuver where the stronger side's King moves to the side, placing a file between the Kings (sometimes even giving the opponent the Opposition while doing so!). This allows the Outflanking King to march forward towards the target, without allowing the enemy monarch to step in front of it and take Direct Opposition. Rook Endgames _.,..Rook and two connected passed pawns (knight-pawn and rook pawn, which is the hardest case) vs. lone Rook. Here is the step-by step winning process: • Advance your pawns together so your King has shelter, your pawns can defend one another, and blockades can be avoided-don't allow one pawn to madly charge down the board on its own! • Make sure your King and pawns are in close contact. As in most chess situations, a team effort is needed for a successful result. 1 9 7

No� By taking away all of the black King's legal moves, you've allowed Black to force a draw by playing directly for a stalemate. 1 .a7?? Rd5+ 2.Ka4 2 .Ka6 Ra5+! 3 .Kxa5 stalemate. 2 ...Ra5+! "Take my Rook!"
3.Kb4 Rh5+
"Take it!"
4.Kc4 Rh4+
Also good is 4 . . . Rxb6. 4 . . . Rb4+, trying to make white's King run to the other side of the board before taking on b6, is more melodramatic!

Diagram 203 a h l: J e f � ll White to move Does I .Kf5 win' It's clear that l .Kg6?? creates a draw by stalemate, and that l .Kg5 ?? Kxg7 also draws since Black would have the Opposition. One obvious way to win from our initial position is l .g5 Kh7 2 .g8=Q+! (avoiding 2 .Kf7?? stalemate, and 2 .g6+?? Kg8 with a draw) 2 . . . Kxg8 3 .Kg6 Kh8 4.Kf7 Kh7 5.g6+ and the pawn turns into a Queen. The question, though, was whether White could win by the odd looking l .Kf5. The answer is yes: 1 . . .Kfi! A good try. The more mundane l . . . Kxg7 2 .Kg5 takes the Opposition and is an easy wm.

(and not l . . .Kxa7?? 2.Kc7 when White promotes his b-pawn). The correct way to ice this position is 1 .Kd6 Kh7 2.a8=Q+!

If you see the position's theme, you'll find the moves. The theme is to give white's Rook control of the absolute 7th rank and, as a result, leave black's pieces passive and helpless (in other words, no counterplay for Black!). Since Black threatens to chase the Rook away with . . .Kd8, White needs to give his Rook some breathing room on the 7th. 1 .d6! Creating absolute 7th rank. The other way of doing this is 1 .Bb5 !+ Kd8 (or l . . .Kf8 2.Bc4 with the threat of d6) 2 .d6!. Very good for White, but not as strong, is 1 .e5 Kd8 2 .d6 Bd7. 1 ...exd6 l . . .Bd7 2 .dxe7 is bad for Black since 2 . . .

Diagram 2 1 1 :I h (' d l.' t g h Najdorf-S Garcia, Buenos Aires 1968 Black to move White is two pawns up. Can Black save himself? The game would be drawn if the b-pawns didn't exist. But with them on the board, White will easily score the full point. He has two ways of doing this: Plan 1: Exchange his g-pawn for black's h-pawn. Then force the win of black's Bishop for white's two kingside pawns. Once this is done, white's King will march over to the queenside and eat the b5-pawn, ending the game. Plan 2: Exchange his f- and g-pawns for black's b-pawn and h-pawn. White's two passed pawns would then be too far from each other for Black to deal with. 1 . .. Bb3 + Even easier for White is 1 . . .Kf8 2 .g6 Kg8 (2 . . . hxg6 3 .h7 promotes the h pawn) 3.gxh7+ Kxh7 4.Bg5 Kg8 5.f6 Bb3+ (5 .. .Kf8 6.h7 Bxh7 7.Bh6+ Ke8 8.£7+ promotes the f-pawn) 6.Ke7 Bc4 7.h7+ Kxh7 8.£7 Bxf7 9.Kxf7, 1 -0.

Triangulation? Outflanking? Have I gone berserk? For those that felt panic when they eyed the contents of Part Five, I would guess that you've now calmed down a bit-the material might have been a bit ponderous to go over, but far from difficult to learn. So what's your reward for slogging through topics like Rook and two con nected passers vs. lone Rook? How about an extremely tight understanding of basic endgames that will give you a lifetime of confidence every time the final phase of the game is reached. Make no mistake about it: you can make due (even with an "A" or Expert rating) with the material through Part Five (plus the bits and pieces you pick up from experience) for the rest of your life. Your endgame foundation is that good! So, if you feel that you've now put more than enough effort into the endgame, you can put this book aside without guilt or misgivings. You worked hard and have come a long way, and that's very impressive! However, for these "I never want to see another endgame book for the rest of my life" people, may I sug gest that you spend a bit of time with the three chapters in Endgames for Pure Pleasure (Part Nine). I think that material will send you off in style, and with a smile on your face. For those that have serious aspirations towards Class "A" or even Expert, and who want to know more about the endgame than others in those classes, things will get a bit difficult in Parts Six and Seven. Are you going to tough it out? If so, I'll see you there. 2 1 2 ��;.\1,�",

,,,,. .... ou've come a long way and finally enjoy an elite rating. As you've moved up the ladder, you might have noticed that more and more games reach endings, and often they prove to be rather complex. Now, more than ever, you'll need to have mastered all the endgame material in past sec tions and assimilate the new material here. Believe it or not, ifyou completely master everything through Part Six, you will have an understanding of endgame basics that far surpasses 7 5 % of those in the Expert (2000-2 1 99) category. And it's that lack of general endgame knowledge among tournament players who pride themselves on being "good" that will give you a huge advantage over them during the course of your chess career. Of course, absorbing this new information won't be easy. Everything h ere is far more difficult than anything we've looked at thus far. But I wouldn't present it ifl didn't think it was very learnable and well within the grasp of an "A" class player. So, since you're here and since you seem determined to go to that next level, fasten your seatbelt and let's begin! 2 1 4 You should already be well versed in King and pawn basics, but now it's time to learn a new idea or two that will prepare you for the more expansive, and complicated, examples in Part Seven. Strange Races Many King and pawn endgames are decided by simple races that center on whose pawn promotes first. When one side queens and the other can't, it's usu ally game over. And, when both sides promote, one after the other, it's usually a draw. Much of the beauty of chess, though, lies in the exceptions. And there are several "race exceptions" that are must knows.

I USEFUL ADVICE
King and pawn endgames are always tricky. If you enter one-even one that seems hopeless-take a long think and try to grasp the position's true meaning. T his involves taking into account promotion with checks, the Square of a passed pawn, Opposition, Triangulation, Outflanking, and a King's ability to escort its pawn to the 8th rank.

King and Pawn vs . King and Pawn All versions of this endgame have already been addressed (or indirectly ad dressed) via Strange Races, via Trebuchet (in Part Four), or in any of the King and pawn vs. King positions that can so easily occur. Here are a few more ex amples that should firm up the knowledge you already possess. Diagram 2 1 9

White to move, draw \Vhite will force the win of black's pawn on d5, but the resulting position (if Black responds properly!) is a basic draw: 1 .Kb5 Kc7 2.Kc5 Kd8! Wisely avoiding 2 . . .

Taking the Opposition. 8 ...Kd8 9.d7 Kc7 10.Ke7, 1-0. These two examples were nothing more than glorified versions of basic King and pawn vs. lone King theory. But knowledge of them allows us to solve posi tions that would be unintelligible otherwise. The last several examples made it clear that, aside from simple race considerations (brought about by both pawns being passed), the real question surrounding King and pawn vs. King and pawn theory is whether or not a pawn can be won. If a pawn does indeed drop, the assessment of the resulting position (which has suddenly transposed into one of our already mastered King and pawn vs. lone King situations) is made by who owns the Opposition. Diagram 2 19 saw the defender safely take the Opposition (thus gaining a draw). The position after that (diagram 220) had white's pawn on the 5th rank-a decisive advantage ifthe white King can crash through and pick off the enemy pawn. The position in diagram 2 2 1 takes things a bit further. To fully under stand it, you have to use the tools from diagrams 2 1 9 and 220, plus all your Opposition skills.

RULE
This kind of situation, where the defender must give up his pawn but can take the Opposition, is always drawn unless white's pawn is on the 5th rank. !$Ail$_ u 0 j .#024$( .44Mt tk Q ",I. i Since white's pawn is on the 5th rank, he knows he'll win if he can pick off black's pawn. Black's only hope is to keep the white King from penetrating to e6, f6, or g6, since the d6-pawn will be lost if white's King reaches any of those squares.

White to move wins by 1 .Kg5 when 1 . . . Kf7 2 .Kf5 and 1 . . .Ke7 2 .Kg6 leads to the loss of d6 and the game.
USEFUL ADVICE (IF YOU ARE THE DEFENDER)
Before allowing a position of this nature to occur, make sure the opponent can't penetrate with his King! If he can penetrate, make sure his pawn isn't on the 5th, and that you can take the Opposition when he captures your pawn. """31

The practical study of King and pawn endgames is finite-truly complex/im practical King and pawn endgames become the stuff of theorists or very strong players with a fetish for such things. However, the study of Rook endgames-no matter how complex-always remains eminently useful simply because they oc cur so often and in so many different forms. Though the student might think that the first five parts of this book has left him with a sizeable amount of Rook endgame skill, the daunting fact is that you are still in Rook endgame infancy and will continue to be long after you make master. Nevertheless, don't be depressed by this news. The material presented here in Part Six will leave you with a very solid base of Rook endgame under standing and-on a competitive level-this knowledge will far outgun that which most of your Opposition will ever possess. "Lucena" with a Rook- Pawn We've learned that achieving a Lucena Position guaran tees a win, unless the extra pawn is a rook-pawn. The rule with a "Lucena" rook-pawn-I'm using the word "Lucena" loosely here, since a real Lucena Position only occurs with a knight-pawn, bishop-pawn, or center pawn-is that black's King needs to be cut off by four or more files for White to win (one file is sufficient in a real Lucena). Diagram 2 2 3

White wins 2 2 3 Ru LE If you're into memory prompts, and numbers such as "four or more files" don't do the job for you, another way of stating this rule is, "ft '.1· a win ifthe enemy King is cut offon or beyond the farthest bishop-file. "

White's only plan is to get a Rook to b8 and escape with the King. Thanks to the fact that black's King is four files away from the pawn, White can force a win. However, the technique for achieving this is far more difficult than one might imagine! 1 .Rcl Ke7 2.Rc8 Kd6! 2 . . .Kd7 3 .Rb8 Ra2 4.Kb7 (and not 4.Rb7+?? Kc8, =) 4 . . . Rb2+ 5.Ka6 Ra2+

Rh8 mate is embarrassing, 5.Rg7 Rb2 6.Rb7 Rh2 just repeats the position, and 5.Rb l Kc7 is a dead draw. Diagram 224 a h c d e f g h Dead draw Let's spend a moment explaining why this is so drawn.

Rc3 3 .Rh7+ Kc8 4.Rh8+ Kc7 and it should now be clear that white's King is forever entombed on a8. White to move (from diagram 224): l .Rcl + Kd7 2 .Kb7 (no choice, since 2 .Rd l + Kc7 only helps Black, 2 .Rb l Kc7 gets nowhere fast, and trying to build a Lucena bridge by 3.Rc4 fails to 3 . . .

calm down, you don't need to understand the ins and outs of Queen vs. Rook theory (which I feel is too rare and too hard for this book) to easily win this position. You see, Queen vs. Rook is only difficult if the Rook is fairly close to its King or, at the very least, on the same side of the board (saving it from a Rook-winning fork by white's Queen). In our present position, the Rook and King are far away from each other, and a simple series of checks will pick up the Rook and end the game. 9 ...Kc5 9 . . .Kb5 (9 .. .Kd6 1 0.Qb8+ and 1 l.Qxh2) 1 0.Qb8+ and 1 l .Qxh2 is even more abrupt!

Note how white's Rook is a tower of strength that is helping to push the pawn home. In comparison, black's Rook is passively stopping the inevitable. White wins by Kd4-c5-b6-b7. Both sides should try to get their Rook behind a passed pawn. WiiJf&QJ!k444 .4 .it ,J I . ttk t 5.. ii; . . 44 , J . $& it This means that defensively, having one's Rook behind the enemy passed pawn is of enormous importance. To illustrate, let's take the previous diagram-quite hopeless for Black when white's Rook is behind its pawn-and reverse the posi tion of the Rooks. Diagram 229 White can't win because Black now has an ideal defensive stance with his Rook, while white's Rook is stuck in a corner guarding its pawn. White's only chance is to defend the pawn with his King, then bring his Rook out. But this fails: l .Kc5 Ra2 Many moves are fine. For example, 1 . . . Kg7 also does the job, while 1 . . . Re l +
2.Kb6 Rb l+ 3.Kc5 Re l + i s quite sufficient, though Black can't get too overzeal

White wins after 6 . . .Rc7 7.Rh8+ Kxh8 8.a8=Q+ with a theoretical win that's a bit too complex for our present course of study. I should point out that another way to lose after l .Kc5 is 1 . . .Ra5+?? since this let's White attack the Rook and guard his pawn at the same time by 2 .Kb6. The continuation might then be: 2 . . .

REMEMBER
Many class "A' players have fallen victim to this trap, so always be on the lookout for it! As we can see, having a pawn on the 7th rank, with your Rook in front, is a doubled edged sword. On one hand it dooms your Rook to passivity. On the other, it forces the black King to everlasting imprisonment on h7 and g7 (otherwise the above tactic ends matters quickly). This brings up an important question: If Black gets his Rook behind your pawn (with your Rook in front of it), but the pawn is only on the 6th rank, should you push it to the 7th or leave it where it is? (See diagram 2 3 2) Pushing the pawn to a7 creates an instant draw (the previous examples should have convinced you of this!) because white's Rook would remain forever passive and any attempt to defend the pawn with the white King would fail because black's Rook would just check it away and then return to its defensive position behind the passed pawn.

To push or not to push? The real question here is, how can White try to win? It turns out that White has many advantages: --� His King can easily break black's "block" on the 2nd rank (by scuttling over to bl) and then march up the board to its pawn. When the pawn is on the 7th rank, white's King would have nowhere to hide. With the pawn on the 6th, the King can hide in front of it (on a7). This finally frees the a8-Rook. Black's King is forever stuck on h7 and g7 since any attempt to rush over to the queenside fails to a well-timed a6-a7 when the poor King would be stuck in no-man's land. All these facts make it sound as if White should prevail, and if Black tries to maintain his Rook's position behind the passed pawn White will indeed be able to claim victory: l .Kfl Kh7 Note that black's King can't participate in the defense: 1 . . . Kf7 2.Ke l (2.a7 Kg7! is our basic draw) 2 . . . Ke 7?? (Making a dash for the queenside, but this backfires horribly!) 3 .a7! and suddenly black's King can't get back to the safe squares on g7 and h7. Both 3 . . .Kd7 and 3 . . .

However, what happens if the defending King is trapped one or more files to the side of the pawn? The result of this endgame depends on whether or not the stronger side can reach a Lucena position, and this is determined by the following specific rules (as usual, rook-pawns form exceptions, so we'll only explore positions with a knight-pawn, bishop-pawn, or center pawn):
RULES
A pawn on the 5th rank or beyond wins if the defending King is cut off by one file on the Long Side of the board! A pawn on the 4th rank wins if the defending King is cut off by two files. A knight-pawn is an exception and takes three files.

White easily achieves a Lucena Position because black's King is on the Long Side of the board. Now it's time to address the Long Side and Short Side of the pawn: The Short Side is the side with the least amount of squares from the pawn to the side of the board. In general, the defender should always move his King to the Short Side of the pawn. Placing the defending King on the Short Side is extremely important! The point is that the defending Rook can use the Long Side for long distance checking (known as Checking Distance) without hav ing to worry about his King getting in the way of those checks! By blasting the enemy King with long distance checks, the beleaguered King won't be able to find shelter since approaching the nasty Rook would entail a long trek that completely abandons the battle zone. 1 .Kh5 Preparing to advance the pawn.

However, the "almost" proves to be very important-instead of being on e6, black's King resides on e7. Also, Black has the move. This allows 1 . . . Rf8!. Suddenly it's clear that black's King wasn't cut off at all! Now 2 .Rxf8 Kxf8 is a dead draw, while 2 .Ra l Kf7 ! gets the King to the front of the pawn, achieving a drawn position. Our next example shows how the defender can draw against a pawn on the 5th if his King is correctly placed on the Short Side of the board. Diagram 2 3 9

Black's King is on the Short Side of the pawn Black draws by giving his Rook Checking Distance on the Long Side of the board. 1 . . .Rh8! Suddenly Black threatens a cascade of checks along the distant h-file. Incred ibly, White has no answer to this!

The attempt to block the checks with the white Rook via 2 .ReI fails to 2 . . .Kc7 when black's King gets in front of the pawn with a drawn position. Counting on the King to do the job also doesn't work: 2 .KeS RhS+ 3.Ke6 Rh6+ 4.Kd7 Rh 7+ S .Kc8 Rh8+ 6.Kd7 Rh7+ 7.Ke6 Rh6+ 8.Kf7 Rh7+ (8 .. .Rd6 is also fine) 9.Kg6 Rd7 (Now that white's King is far from its pawn, Black is able to pile up on the abandoned unit and win it.) 1 0.RdI KcS, 1h-1/z. 2 . . . Rh4+ 3.Ke5 Rh5+ 4.Kf6 Or 4.Kf4 RdS and the pawn is lost. 4 ... Rh6+ 5.Ke7 Rh7+ 6.Kf8 Rd7, 1/z-'lz. Di agram 240 a h c d e f g h White to move, draw Earlier we stated that a pawn on the 4th rank wins if the defending King is cut off by two files. The position in diagram 240 is drawn because the defending king is only cut off by one file.
1.Kf4
The tempting l .eS seems strong, since 1 . . .Re8?? 2 .Ke4 takes us to our first rule: A pawn on the 5th rank or beyond wins ifthe enemy King is cut off by one file on the Long Side of the board. However, instead of the compliant I . . . Re8, Black can answer I .eS with I . . .Ra4! when white's King is cut off from its pawn! Now moves that takes the white Rook off the cl-file allows . . . Kd7 with an im mediate draw, 2 . Rd6+ Kc7 also leaves White without a good follow-up, and 2 .Rd4 Rxd4 is a drawn King and pawn vs. King endgame. Thus: I .eS Ra4 2 .e6. Now White threatens to win by 3 .e7 Ra8 4.Rd8, but 2 . . .Kc7! (stopping the aforementioned possibility of e7 followed by Rd8) holds the draw: 3.Rd7 + (3 .e7 Ra8 followed by . . .Re8, =) 3 . . .Kc8 4.Rh7 (4.Kd3 or 4.Rd l run into 4 . . .

l. . . Rf8+ This frontal check defense is quite effective against a pawn on the 4th rank.
2.Kg5
Note that 2.Ke5 Re8+ 3.Kf5 Rf8+ 4.Ke6 Re8+ gets White absolutely nowhere due to the vulnerability of the pawn. 2 ...Re8 ! And not 2 . . .Rg8+? ? 3 .Kf6 when 3 . . .Rf8+ 4.Ke7 and 3 . . .Re8 4.e5 both lose for Black. Also note that 3 . . .Rh8 doesn't give Black enough Checking Distance because black's King is on the Long Side: 4.e5 Rh6+ 5.Kg5 Re6 (5 . . . Rh8 6.e6)
6.Kf5 Re8 7.e6, winning.
The annoying attack against e4 (2 . . . Re8) freezes the pawn in its tracks and forces White to lose time defending the pawn.
3.Kf5 Rf8 + 4.Kg6 Re8! 5.Rd4
White's last shot (which threatens 6.Kf7 Re5 7.Kf6 Re8 8.e5), since 5.Re l Kd6 i s completely drawn. 5 ...Kc5! A very important resource! Note that if our original position had started with black's King on c7 instead of c6, this move wouldn't be possible and the result would be very different: Diagram 2 4 1 a h c <l e f g h Black to move draws, White to move wins Black to move draws in two different ways: 1 . . .Kc6 (which takes us back to diagram 240) or 1 . . .Rd8 2.Rxd8 Kxd8 3.Kf4 Ke8!, 1/z-1/i . White to move wins because he can take advantage of the fact that Black no longer has the . . .Kc5 defensive idea at his disposal: 1 .Kf4 Rf8+ 2 .Kg5 Re8 3 .Kf5 Rf8+ 4.Kg6 Re8! 5.Rd4 Kc6 6.Kf7 Re5 (6 .. .Kc5 7.Rd5+, 1 -0) 7.Kf6 Re8

is more problematic. In this case the stronger side usually wins if the defending King is trapped three files away. The position in diagram 243 is drawn since the defending King is only two files away. 1 .Re2 White can't improve his position so he "passes" in the hope that Black will make a mistake. 1 .. .Kd6! Oddly, this is the only way to draw! Let's look at the alternatives and see why: l . . . Rg7 ?? destroys the Rook's Checking Distance. Black is toast after 2 .Kh4 Rh7+ 3.Kg5 Rg7 + 4.Kh5 Rh7+ 5.Kg6. 1 . ..Ra8?? 2 .g5 is hopeless. 1 . . . Kd4? ? is the most interesting blunder since it allows White to cut the black King off on a rank by 2.Re6! Kd5 3 .Rh6. Diagram 244 a h c d e f g h Black is lost! Suddenly black's game is lost! His King can't get back into the fight since the 6th rank is a no-pass zone, and the white Rook blocks all checks along the h-file which allows the King to calmly march up to h5. A sample of what could occur: 3 . . .Ke5 4.Kh4 Rg7 5.Kh5 Rg8 6.g5 Kf5 7.Rf6+ Ke5 8.Kh6 Rh8+ 9.Kg7 Rh l 1 0.Rf2 Ke6 1 l .g6 and White will achieve the desired Lucena Position.

Sometimes cutting the defending King off along a rank is as good as cutting it off along a file.

2.Re4
Otherwise Black just moves his King back and forth between d6 and d5. By defending his pawn with the Rook, White hopes to relieve his King of guard duty which will allow it to march triumphantly down the board. 2 . . . Kd5! Chasing the Rook away from its good position. A major mistake would be 2 . . .Kd7?? 3 .Kh4 Rh8+ 4.Kg5 Rg8+ 5.Kf6 Rf8+ (or 6.g5 would have followed)
6.Kg7 and White wins.

Black draws easily after 3.Ra4 Ke6. 3 . . . Kd6 and White must agree to a draw since he can't make any progress. Bishop of Opposite Colors (Bishop and Two Connected Passers vs. Lone Bishop and King) One would think that this endgame would be an easy win for the two con nected passed pawns. However, this simply isn't the case. To illustrate my point, allow me to indulge in a little story. The year was 1 978, the city was London, and I was playing my second game with the white pieces in the span of a few months against Jonathan Speelman. I had won the first and now my opponent was after blood. The opening promised a sharp struggle: 1 .e4 c5 2.NO d6 3 .d4 cxd4 4.Nxd4 Nf6 5.Nc3 a6 6.Bg5 Nc6 7.Qd2 e6

it looks dangerous for Black, but as I sat there wondering why my opponent exuded an air of confidence, I decided to take a deep look at the position for the first time (Mindlessly memorizing book, and exploring a variation seriously, are two very different things!). Sure enough, after pondering the situation for a long while I realized that White didn't have anything at all! It occurred to me that after 1 8. . .Qf6 19.Rdfl Rfd8 20.h5 Bf8 2 1 .hxg6 hxg6 22.g4 Bg7 my opponent's Bishop would be very happy on g7 where it would defend the black King while simultaneously eyeing my monarch in a lecherous state of rut.

Is Black getting something? My opponent was getting a bit excited, no doubt due to the fact that both my g-pawns were in bad shape. Losing them would lead to two black connected passed pawns marching down the board_ Was it time for me to get hysterical? Not at all ! Why? Because I knew that the following position (a true worst case scenario) was dead drawn. Diagram 248 a h c <l e f g h Dead draw! That's right. If White loses both g-pawns and his three queenside pawns for black's two, the game is still a draw!

Now the black King is stuck defending the e6-pawn. He has to give up his plan and try 3 ...Ke5 4.Bc8 Kd6 5.Ke4 But now Black will have to push his pawns if he wants to win, and that will be examined next. However, we've discovered an important idea (brought to light by the moves 2 .Be8! and 3 .Bd7 !) when defending this kind of opposite colored Bishop endgame: The defender can tie his opponent's King down by using his Bishop to attack the pawns. We'll see many examples of this rule in action. M.ea tht od z2·· .. � Black shoves his pawns forward! (From diagram 249) 1 . . .f5 2.Bh3 !

This fine move gives Black two choices: he can play . . . Kf6 and simply guard the pawn for the rest of the game (which means he'll make no progress what soever), or he can push the pawn to e5, which is clearly what Black was aiming for anyway. However, once this pawn moves to e5, White can then demonstrate his key defensive plan. 2 . . . e5 Now Black threatens (after something hideous such as 3 .Ba4??) 3 . . .e4+ 4.Ke3 Bc5+ 5.Ke2 f4 when the pawns will soon make their way to the 6th rank: 6.Bc2 f3+ 7.Kel Kf4 8.Bbl e3 9.Bd3 Bb4+ 1 0.Kfl Ke5 (Black will march his King around to d2 so he can play . . .e3 -e2+ without letting White sacrifice his Bishop for both enemy pawns.

White will simply play Bg2 - h l-g2-h l and Black can't make progress since ... f4-f3+ i s always met by Bxf3 . Note how the Bishop ties the black King to the defense of its e-pawn. However, our next position is wun fur Black. Di agram 2 5 1 a h c d e f g h White loses! Ah, the lovely sound of chess players mumbling in confusion! Why is diagram 2 50 a dead draw while this one is dead lost? Understanding the difference will give you the true key to this whole endgame! In the drawn version of this position (diagram 250), black's King is forever doomed to baby-sit the e4-pawn. That means he can't get the King to g3 (which would allow a winning . . .f4-f3 push) because the e-pawn would hang. Of course, if Black tries . . .e4-e3, then White just moves his Bishop mindlessly (and end lessly!) along the hl-a8 diagonal, forming a perfect block to both enemy pawns. In the losing version (diagram 2 5 1 ), the e4-pawn is not attacked by the white Bishop. Now the black King is indeed free to roam, and after . . .Kd4-e3 , the . . . f4-f3 advance will seal the deal.

Let's look at a simple example of this: Diagram 2 52
[diagram]
Black has one last shot In this position, we're familiar with 1 . . .d4 2 .Bc2 when we have our basic dead drawn defensive posture. But suppose Black refuses to take the bait and instead tries to activate his King by 1 . .. Kd4. Here's a quick white suicide that will serve as an example of what Black has in mind: 2.Bc2 Kc3 3 .Bb l?? (3 .Kd l !) 3 ...Kb2 when the Bishop, and the game, are lost! Fortunately, after 1 . . . Kd4 White can easily draw if he remembers to always restrict the enemy King's movements by forcing it to defend its pawns. Thus

Fortresses in Bishop-up Endgames The idea of a defensive fortress is an important one. In general, you're not expected to memorize lots of fortress examples. Instead, seeing a few patterns and keeping the possibility in mind will serve you well. Fortresses in Bishop-up endgames are fairly common due to the Bishop's in ability to control a whole color complex. These usually occur when the stronger side's rook-pawn or knight-pawn get down to the sixth and/or 7th rank, or if a rook-pawn of the wrong color is lurking on the board. Here are a few examples that don't need much explanation.

However, now Black skips between e8 and f8 and, again, White must eventually tip his hat to the draw. As stated earlier, elf-, d-, and e-pawns prevent such blockades, as show by the following example:

White to move wins Usually a rook-pawn will draw in a Queen vs. King and pawn on the 7th rank endgame. However, the position in the diagram is an exception, and the tech nique White makes use of is important. It shows how, in some endgames, you can allow one side to promote his pawn to a Queen and still win by weaving a back rank mating net.
1.Kg6
Not 1 .Kh6?? since that would stalemate the black King! By l .Kg6, White moves his King closer to the enemy pawn and simultaneously blocks the Queen's control over the g-file, thus preventing an unpleasant stalemate. 1 . .. Kg2 2 .Kf5 + In this kind of endgame, White wins if he can get his King into the box shown in diagram 260. The reason for this will be clear in a moment. 2 5 3

4.Kg4!
White lets Black make a Queen! 4 . . .hl=Q 5.Kg3 and Black must resign since he can't stop Qf2 mate or a back rank mate unless he gives away his Queen. As you can see, in the case of a rook-pawn vs. a Queen and close King (dia grams 259 and 260), the Queen can easily create this mate from any position along its 2nd rank (the moves after diagram 260 had White's Queen settling on b2). Thus, if the white King gets in the box shown in diagram 260 (with White having the move or Black being in check), he always wins. Note that this idea is sometimes possible against a bishop-pawn-whether it does or doesn't work against the other pawns is of no consequence since the Queen easily beats a knight-pawn or center pawn no matter where the Kings might stand. In a situation where Black turns his bishop-pawn into a new Queen and has the move, the white King has to be on its third rank in front of the enemy King, and the white Queen must be on a2 or e2 in the case of a c-pawn/h2 or d2 in the case of an f-pawn. Diagrams 2 6 1 and 262 clearly illus trate both situations. From diagram 2 6 1 : 1.Qh2! (the best possible square) 1...Kel 2.Kf4 fl=Q+

White to move, draw The position in diagram 262 looks promising for White since his King is quite close: 1 .Qe2 Kbl ?? 2.Kc4 cl=Q+ 3 .Kb3 mates. Sadly, 1 .Qe2 Kal! is a huge improvement which forces a draw: 2 .Qd2 (2 .Qxc2 stalemate) 2 ...Kbl 3.Kb4 cl=Q and White can't win. In the case of a bishop-pawn, mate is only possible if White has the move im mediately after Black pomotes his pawn to a Queen, or if the Queen can safely reach one of the specified squares (i.e., c-pawn = a2 or e2 , while the f-pawn = h2 or d2). As we've seen (in diagram 262), the Queen on e2 doesn't always ice the win, but getting the Queen to h2 (as in diagram 2 6 1 ) grabs the brass ring and doesn't let go. Overview _.,. Complex positions can't be solved unless you are firmly trained in endgame basics! King and Pawn endgames _.,. In a King and pawn vs. King and pawn situation, when the defending side can give up his pawn but take the Opposition, the game is drawn unless the stronger side's pawn is on the 5th rank. _.,. It's clear that, aside from simple race considerations (brought about by both pawns being passed), the real question surrounding King and pawn vs. King and pawn theory is whether or not a pawn can be won. If a pawn does indeed drop, the assessment of the resulting position (which has suddenly transposed into one of our already mastered King and pawn vs. lone King situations) is made by who owns the Opposition. Rook Endgames _.,. In a Rook and pawn endgame, a "Lucena" with a rook-pawn is only won if the defending King is cut off by four or more files. Another way of putting it is: It's a win if the enemy King is cut off on or beyond the farthest bishop-file. _.,. In general, both sides should strive to get their Rooks behind a passed pawn. _.,. In the case of a passed rook-pawn on the 6th with the defending Rook behind it, the stronger sides King must try and wend its way down the board and find shelter in front of its pawn. When this is going to happen, having the defending Rook behind the passed pawn doesn't quite hold up, so a knowledge of the Vancura Position is necessary. _.,. The Vancura Position doesn't suffice if it's facing any pawn other than a rook-pawn.

SOLUTION Diagram 274 a h c d e f � h Horwitz, 1879 White to move \Vhat in the world is going on here? The problem White faces is not so much his opponent's three kingside pawns, but rather the fact that his King is far from the queenside. This means that if we removed all the kingside pawns, the resulting position is drawn. The solution is to use the movements of the kingside pawns to get white's King a bit closer, then employ the idea we learned in "A Trick Win in Queen vs. rook-pawn on 7th" (diagram 2 59) which allows Black to promote his a-pawn, only to find himself in a mating net.

Botvinnik. Complex Rook endgames are the main focus of this section, and it takes a certain amount of chess strength (i.e., tactical clarity and the ability to absorb complicated patterns) and work ethic to absorb the advanced material presented here. Apparently, you've succeeded in doing so. This not only verifies that you belong in the "A" class, but it also speaks volumes about your dedication to climbing up the rating ladder. At this point, you could easily rest on your endgame laurels for the rest of your life and never have to back-down to anyone when the final phase of a game is reached. However, why stop here? You've done the vast majority of "grunt-work" and will be surprised to find that the Expert section concentrates more on concepts and making use of the material you already possess than the memorization of alien ideas and rules. So, when you've recovered from the effort you've just made and feel that it's time to leave the "A" class behind and become an Expert, feel free to open yourself up to the mysteries of Part Seven.

"'Tl 0 = m >< t this point you know enough basics to change your general mode of study. Instead of looking at isolated positions, we will look at more complex situations that are made easy by being firmly schooled in all the foundation endgames. Here you'll be introduced to the concept of solving complicated positions by beginning with a very simple idea (i.e., your previously acquired knowledge), then adding a bit more complexity to it, and adding to it again. This "flow" of information, in essence a Flowchart, can be used to deconstruct a surprising amount of endings, no matter how ad vanced they might appear to be at first glance. Rook endgames are a mystery to most players. The fact is, if you don't know the building blocks of Rook endgames, you won't be able to play any Rook endgame properly. In other words, knowledge is a must. Since you're reading this Expert section, you should be well acquainted with the ins-and-outs of basic Rook endgame theory. This will allow you to understand the more com plex situations that we'll be addressing here, and also make the concept of the Flowchart rather easy to grasp. The Flowchart - Taking a Simple Position Into Deeper Water We will now take a leap into Flowchart mentality-a simple technique that will enable you to turn many complex positions, which at first glance will appear unintelligible, into simple situations that you have already mastered. The Flowchart mentality is, in reality, a form of transition where you take the game from one situation to another and, perhaps, to yet another! This can mean maneuvering a complex Rook endgame into a basic, well known situation, or it can mean going from one specific kind of endgame to a completely different situation (for example, a Rook and minor piece can turn into a favorable Rook endgame if you exchange the minor pieces, and this can turn into a winning King and pawn endgame if you later exchange the Rooks). Let's start with the following "confusing" position. Diagram 2 76 a b c J e g h Black to mov2e73, can he win?

Black wins with accurate play Since building block four was an easy win for White, it's clear that the same holds true here if Black can win the f4-pawn. The winning method is simple and instructive. 1 . . .Kc7 If Black wants to make contact with the f4-pawn, he must break through the 6th rank.

9.Ra4+ Ke3
Zugzwang! White is forced to drop his pawn or move his King to a poor square.
10.Kh2 Kf3 and White must give up the pawn since 1 1 .Kh3?? Rh l is mate.
After 1 l .Ra8 Kxf4 we are back to building block four. These six building block positions should give you enough Flowchart knowledge to make solving our original two "problems" possible. So let's take another look. Diagram 2 8 5 a b c <l e f g h Black to move, can he win? A quick guess would tell us that Black can't win because if he pushes his a pawn to a2 and trades the g5-pawn for white's h3-pawn, the resulting two extra pawn position is drawn, as shown in building block three. Diagram 286 a b c <l e f g h Black to move, can he win? This position, though, seems very winnable because we can see a clear "light at the end of the tunnel." Using building block four as our guidepost, we know that pushing the a-pawn to a2 (which freezes the white King) and then exchang ing the f5-pawn for the g3 -pawn would be game over.
P A R T S E V E N - E N D G A M E S F 0 R E X P E R T S ( 2 0 0 0 - 2 1 9 9 ) 279
Furthermore, building block six showed us that we would win the position even if we got the a-pawn to a2 and dragged white's g-pawn to f4. Once we have a goal position in mind, coming up with the actual moves that allow us to reach our dream position is rather easy: 1 . ..a4 Black immediately rushes his pawn to a2 , knowing that this will leave the white King shackled to the h2 - and g2-squares.
2.Kf2 Ral 3 .Kf3 a3 4.Kg2
And not 4.Kf4?? a2 when White can't stop a back rank check followed by the promotion of the a-pawn. 4 ...a2 Black's first goal is accomplished! white's King is now stuck on h2 and g2 . If you are not completely familiar with this, the material in Part Six should refresh your memory.
5.Kh2 f4! 6.gxf4 f5! and we've reached building block six, which we should
now know is a basic win for Black. We'll be looking at other complex situations in Part Seven where Flowcharts prove useful, but all of them are only comprehensible if you've retained the lessons learned in the first six parts of this book. Rook and Two Connected Passed Pawns vs. Rook and Pawn Positions featuring two passed pawns vs. one enemy passed pawn are usually winning for the two pawns. Previous knowledge is important here, too, since many positions are won by following basic rules, and by exchanging a pair of pawns and creating a winning Rook and one vs. Rook position. Diagram 287

However, what if a Philidor goes bad and one isn't allowed to use the main "dominate the rank and stop the enemy King from advancing" idea? Diagram 2 89 a h c d e f g h White to move and cause black pain We used this same diagram in Part Four, though in that case we gave Black the move. This allowed him to end things right away by 1 . . . Rh6 when White can't make any progress. However, what if White has the move? In that case

Of course, if you don't know "plan B" off the top of your head, and if you don't remember our lessons about the Philidor Position (Part Four), the Lucena Position (Part Four), Checking Distance (Part Six) and the Short and Long Side of the board (Part Six), then you are, to put it mildly, up the creek without a paddle. Let's play a few moves so you can see how knowledge of the Rook endgame basics (as listed above), and the Flowchart they allow you to create, will make your life easy. 1 .Rg6!

White can't make progress and, since Black has demon strated his understanding of this endgame, the game can be agreed drawn. Pawns on One Side of the Board In the vast majority of endgames, the defender's drawing chances are improved with every pawn trade. This is certainly the case of a Rook endgame where one side has an extra pawn, but all the pawns are situated on the same side of the board. The defensive ideas are based on: --� Trade as many pawns as possible (unless striving for a particular pawn exchange severely weakens your pawn formation). --� Keep the Rook as active as possible (preferably tying the defender's King down to the defense of its pawns).
286 S I L M A N ' S C O M P L E T E E N D G A M E C O U R S E
Keep trading down until you end up with a Philidor position, which we know from experience is a simple draw. Rook and Two vs. Rook and One In positions where the two vs. one pawn difference is on one side of the board, the game is usually drawn if the stronger side doesn 't have a passed pawn. Nevertheless, even in non-passed pawn situations, like e- and f- vs. f-pawn, the defense can still be difficult in over-the-board practice (just be cause something is a theoretical draw doesn't mean it's easy to achieve!). The simplest two vs. one situation to draw is King, Rook, and h- and g-pawns vs. King, Rook, and g-pawn. However, even here good players have been known to botch the defense and go down in flames. Unfortunately, in cases where one side does have a passed pawn, these end games often prove far more complex than one might imagine. For example, if one side has a passed pawn, as in e- & f- vs. g-pawn, the stronger side has serious winning chances. There are several reasons for this: The stronger side's King will enjoy more cover than its black counterpart. The stronger side can use his greater force to push the opponent back and, ideally, win the defender's remaining pawn. The stronger side can push his pawns to the 5th and/or 6th rank, exchange a pair of pawns, and end up with a favorable King, Rook and pawn vs. King and Rook situation where the weaker side hasn't been allowed to create his ideal defensive setup. The passed pawn will always be threatening to "go somewhere," forcing the defender to deal with that on top of everything else. Personally, I've met very few players under 2400 who have mastered these different two vs. one on the same side of the board situations. And why should they? The defensive technique is hard to quantify, and I find that most of the positions need heaping doses of common sense, care, accurate calculation, and a good knowledge of more basic positions to draw. As a result, I'll leave it to the reader to study these complex situations if and when he feels the need to do so-personally, I strongly feel that such in-depth study of complex specifics is a waste of time for players in the Expert and even low Master class.

U.SEFUL ADVICE.
Don't let the gobbledygook scare you! Stick with the basics and with the new patterns I'm about to show you and life should prove easy. Having said that, we can still acquire a basic understanding of many two vs. one situations by making use of a simple defensive Flowchart: Don't allow a losing Rook and one vs. Rook position to occur. This usually means that the defending King gets trapped on the side and can no longer prevent a Lucena from materializing, or it can mean that the defending Rook is passively placed. Trade a pawn and get a Philidor Position. King and pawn endgames might occur. You'll need to make occasional use of your of knowledge of Trebuchet (Part Four) if you're going to do well in cases like this. You'll need to know the drawing technique for failed Philidor positions (found in Part Seven). Let's take the following position and let it show us how all these things might occur from a "simple" Rook and two vs. Rook and one endgame.

2. Rb7+
In Markus - Lenhardt, Poland 1993, White gave Black a chance to move off the rank by 2.Ra6 and only checked after 2 . . . Rb5 3 .Ra7+, when the game was agreed drawn. Evidently, White didn't realize that there was still a lot of tricky chess to be played, though perhaps the fact that it was already move 9 1 and rigor mortis was beginning to set in had something to do with the somewhat hasty peace offering. 2 . . . Kf8! 2 . . .Ke6?? 3 .f5+! Kxe5 4.Re7+ Kd6 5.Rxf7 leads to a winning Rook and pawn vs. Rook position since black's King can no longer get in front of the pawn.

White can't make any progress. We've seen that the stronger side's chances (in a Rook and two vs. Rook and one) are based on pushing his pawns to the 5 th rank, which creates a squeeze against the defending King and pressure against the weaker side's final pawn. With that in mind, the defender can't wait passively for his opponent to tighten the screws. The next position is a very basic example of this. Diagram 297

This key move stops white's pawns from expanding (no big squeeze!) since h3 followed by g4 would allow a well-received pawn trade.

Black has managed to get in the extremely useful . . .h7-h5 advance. He should now draw easily by following our basic formula: Exchange pawns.

And trading a pair of pawns is definitely a part of black's plans� 3 .hxg4 g5 ! Telling \Vhite that any future advance of the f-pawn will lead to even more pawn exchanges. Play now enters areas we've already explored. Rook and Three vs. Rook and Two, Rook and Two vs. Rook and One, and even Philidor and "Philidor gone bad" situations. For example:
4.Rc3
Black would meet 4.Kg3 with 4 . . .Rb3 , continuing to annoy \Vhite with pins. Seeing that he has to allow another exchange of pawns after f2-f4, \Vhite hopes to recapture on f4 with his e-pawn since split e- and g- vs. f-pawn offers no chances at all. 4 ...f6 5.Kg3 Kg6 6.f4 gxf4+ 7.exf4 As stated earlier, accepting split pawns by 7 .Kxf4 doesn't give \Vhite any any hope of victory. 7 . . .Rbl It's a good idea to keep the Rook as active as possible.

Black to move and save himself If you imagine this coming from a four vs. three situation (chopped down to a three vs. two and finally two vs. one), it's clear that White has made real progress. In fact, one can imagine Black panicking here and going down in multi-colored flames: l . . . Re8?? 2 .Kxf6 Kg8 3 .Kg6 Rc8 4.f6 with an easy win thanks to the passive black Rook as seen in Part Four. Fortunately, if you studiously learned the lessons in the order given, you'll be aware of the "Philidor gone bad" formula and, without hesitation, toss your Rook behind white's (soon to be) passed f-pawn. 1 . ..Rf4! This isn't ideal since we'd prefer the Rook on fl (Checking Distance). How ever, it turns out that this still allows Black to draw via his usual "Philidor gone bad" techniques.

Clearly, 2 .Ra8+ Ke7 only helps Black. Also ineffective is 2 .Ra7 Rfl with a po sition explored earlier in Part Seven. In case of 2 .Rxf6+ Kg8 3 .Ra6 Rg4+ 4.Kf6 Rf4, we end up in the same position that occurs after 2 .Kxf6. 2 ...Kg8! Going to the Short Side o fthe board so, in some lines, black's Rook can have Checking Distance on the side. 3 .Ra8+ Nothing is changed by 3 .Ra7 Rfl , while 3 .Ke6 Re4+ 4.Kf6 Rf4 and 3 .Kg6 Rg4+ 4.Kf6 Rf4 also achieve nothing. 3 .. .

4 . . .Kg7 and White can't make progress. We've seen that, in a Rook and four vs. Rook and three, exchanging pawns is something the defender loves to see. That leaves the stronger side with only one other idea: he needs to avoid trades and try and gain some space by push ing his center pawn up the board. This is by far the more dangerous plan and, even though it is still a draw, it's worth avoiding by making use of the following defensive setup. Diagram 306

White to move Black threatens to make things difficult for White with 1 . . . e5 when White can draw by 2 .Rb6 (keeping black's King at bay) but it's complicated and far beyond what the student needs to know at this stage of his endgame training. However, knowing that such positions are dangerous is important, and this knowledge should frighten the defender so much that he goes out of his way to avoid the advance of the e-pawn. Thus the move 1 .f4! and the resulting defensive posture has proven remarkably effective. Diagram 307

The f-pawn stops black's e-pawn in its tracks while the white Rook ties black's King to its pawn on f7. Since an attack on g3 via l . . .Ra3 can be comfortably met by 2 .Kf2 , Black is forced to "go for the gusto" with:
1.. .Kf6 2.Rc7 Kf5
Otherwise White would continue to shuffle his Rook back and forth along the 7th rank.

lessly drawn position. We've looked at Bishop of opposite color endgames, but what happens if the Bishops are of the same color? Where the presence of opposite colored Bishops gives the defender hope of drawing, same-colored Bishops usually guarantee the side with the extra pawn(s) serious winning chances. Diagram 308 When up a pawn (with no other pawns remaining), the stronger side has win ning chances if the pawn is advanced and if the defending King isn't able to get in front of it. In general, a situation will often be reached where the defending Bishop is preventing the pawn from advancing (an immediate draw will result if it can sacrifice itself for the last pawn). The stronger side can only win if his own Bishop can block the diagonal of the defending Bishop. Diagram 308 offers a simplistic example of this. 1 .Be5 Kg6 2.Bc7, 1 -0. Even if the weaker side's Bishop is on the longer diagonal (d8-h4 instead of d8-a5, as in the following position) the game is still "in the bag." In diagram 3 09 the black Bishop's control of the h4-d8 diagonal makes things a bit harder for White, but black's cause is still hopeless.

In this kind of endgame, center pawns only win if the defending King isn't tt ,o,1 n top of the action. it . .L. WttS . U ". . t .4..J Here white's normal winning idea of chasing black's Bishop to the a5-d8 diagonal and then maneuvering his own Bishop to c7 is no longer viable since black's King controls the c7-square: l .Bd8 Bel 2.Bg5 (2 .Bb6 Bh4) 2 ...Ba5 3 .Bd2 Bb6 4.Bf4 Ba5 fails to make progress for White. Note that Black didn't face any problems here because: -� The c7-square is covered by black's Bishop and King. -� White's King is frozen since it needs to defend the cl-pawn. -� Black will never run out of tempo moves since he can shuffle his Bishop to g5, f6, and/or e7 at will, while he also has access to three squares on the a5-d8 diagonal if his Bishop is chased there.

RULE
This "shuffle defense" isn't possible if the pawn is a bishop-pawn-then the side diagonal is shortened and zugzwangs appear. D iagram 3 1 1
[diagram]
White wins White's first order of business is to chase the black Bishop off the a3 -f8 di agonal and onto the fatally short h6-f8 line. 1 .Bg7 Bb4 2.Bf'B Bd2 3 .Bc5 Bh6 Our first goal has been reached, and black's Bishop is now stuck on the un comfortably short h6-f8 diagonal. Next stop, zugzwang!
4.Bd4!
Suddenly Black has no good move! Moving the Bishop off the h6-f8 diagonal lets White make a new Queen, while moves like 4 . . . Bg7 or 4 . . . Bf8 both hang the Bishop. Since 4 . . .Kf6 isn't possible, and since 4 . . .Kg5 runs into 5.Be3+, Black is left with either 4 . . .Kf5 or 4 . . . Kh5. Sadly, White would then end matters with 5 .Bg7, ensuring the successful promotion of the pawn. Diagram 3 1 2 This idea of a shortened defensive diagonal means that one's winning chances improve when the pawn is a bishop-pawn and knight- pawn. '*'*· t 91Q 4W( Q 0 4 . "k . '!' a b c d e f g h L.

White wins by chasing the black Bishop off the h2 -b8 diagonal and onto the pathetically short a 7-b8 complex. Then a timely Bishop move/sacrifice along the gl-a7 diagonal forces the black Bishop off the queening square and allows the pawn to successfully promote.

The rest: 7 ...Bg3 8.Ba7 Bf4 9.Bb8 Be3 10.Bg3 Ba7 l 1.Bt1, 1 -0. This leaves us with one question: from our last diagram, why was 3 .Bc5 the only way to win? Wouldn't 3.Be3 be just as effective? It's important that you
304 S I L M A N ' S C O M P L E T E E N D G A M E C O U R S E
understand the answer to this question: 3 .Be3 Bd6 4.Bg5 Kb5 5.Bd8 Kc6
6.Be7 Bh2 and 7.Bc5 isn't possible due to 7 . . .Kxc5. Therefore, 3 .Bc5 ! was very
important since it stopped Black from moving his Bishop to d6, which in turn allows White to successfully swing his Bishop with tempo to the gl-a7 diagonal and avoid contact with black's King. Let's repeat this in a slight different way: 3.Bc5! prevents . . .Bd6 and forces the black Bishop to move to g3 , f4, or e5. When White ultimately challenges that Bishop via Bh4, Bg5 , or Bf6, white's Bishop will then be out of reach of the enemy King (now on c6) when it moves to f2, e3, or d4. Centurini, in the middle of the nineteenth century, postulated that a zugzwang isn't possible if two free squares along the crucial diagonal remain open to the defending Bishop. If the defending Bishop has less than two, then the stronger side will usually win (there are a couple of exceptions, but since we're after con cept and not brute memorization, we'll let these pass by-if you wish to make an in-depth study of this kind of Bishop endgame, you can find the exceptions in any detailed endgame tome). Centurini's Rule A zugzwang isn't possible if two free squares along the crucial diagonal remain open to the defending Bishop. If the defending B ishop has less than two, then the stronger s ide will usually win. l*iii il % S.4R 14 .c st . Ji 44$ ' a. t iUidll@lt(tM .M.Q4QJ£!

D iagram 3 1 4

P A R T S E V E N - E N D G A M E S F 0 R E X P E R T S ( 2 0 0 0 - 2 l 9 9 ) 305
by moving the Bishop to a6). This will force black's Bishop to the a6-c8 diagonal, but he will find it impossible to remain there due to the diagonal's shortness (only one free square will be available which, according to Centurini's Rule, means that black's defense will break down). l .Bb7 Bd3 2.Ba6 Be4 3 .Bb5 ! Phase one is accomplished. Now Black has to try and set up a block along the shorter, and thus less stable, a6-c8 diagonal. 3 . . .Bb7 4.Bd7! Naturally, 4.Kxb7?? Kxa5 must be avoided. After 4.Bd7, we have Centurini's rule: "If the defending Bishop has less than two free squares along the crucial diagonal, zugszwang will occur and the stronger side will win." Indeed, this position is zugszwang since black's Bishop only has one free square along the a6-c8 diagonal. Thus, any black King move will allow Kxb7, and any black Bishop move along the h l -a8 diagonal will allow the pawn to safely make its way up the board. 4 . . .Bg2 5.a6 BB 6.a7, 1 -0 since 7.Bc6 follows. Two extra split pawns usually win since in most cases the stronger side can play to promote one pawn, secure in the knowledge that the defender can no longer draw by sacrificing his Bishop since the remaining pawn will eventually promote. Diagram 3 1 5 a b c d e g h White wins l.d6 Ba5 ( I . . .Bb4 2.Bf6 followed by Kc7) 2.Bf6, 1 -0 since Black has no way to deal with 3 .Kc8, 4.d7, and 5.d8=Q. As always, one must be mindful of cases where one of the pawns is a rook pawn of the wrong color.

Diagram 3 1 7 a b c J e f g h White wins 1 .d4+ An important idea: pushing the cl-pawn takes control of the dark squares (c5 and e5) while the Bishop keeps an eye on the light squares.

Naturally, 1 3 .BhS+ Kd7 14.e8=Q+ nukes Black, but why not force mate. 13 ... Bxd7 14.Bh5 mate. Pretty easy, as long as you don't allow one of two things: Don't let the defender give up his Bishop for both pawns. Don't let the defender achieve a blockade by creating a hole (which the defender's King would live on) on the opposite color of your Bishop. In general, the study of Queen endgames is not something a non-professional should waste his time on. I recall playing a five-minute game against Fritz where I ended up on the happy side of a Queen and pawn vs. Queen position. I had no idea if it was a theoretical win for me or not, but that didn't matter-it was clear that I could torture the computer for a long, long time. Suddenly Fritz "lit up" and announced that I could mate it in 83 moves! Horrified, I did something that seemed logical and Fritz said, "Mate in 87 ! " I then turned Fritz off-who needed the humiliation? The rarified air of Queen endgame theory shouldn't be inhaled until you're a senior master (2400 and up), but the following situations deserve a "first taste" right now. Blockade - Queen vs . Rook and Pawn In general, any pawn on the 2nd rank other than a rook-pawn will give the defender a draw unless the stronger side's King has managed to break through to the 6th rank. A knight-pawn almost always draws. Diagram 3 1 8
[diagram]
Philidor, 1 777 Draw Black has all the key bases covered:
P A RT S E V E N - E N D G A M E S F O R E X P E R T S ( 2 0 0 0 - 2 1 9 9 ) 309
--· His Rook is stopping white's King from penetrating to the 6th and/or 7th ranks. His Rook can mark time by going to two safe posts (c6 and e6). A rook-pawn only allows the defender one safe post. White's Queen isn't able to get behind the pawn and it will never be able to chase black's King away from e7, e8, or c7, c8. Thus, after 1.Qh8 Rc6 2.Qg7+ Ke8 White can't improve his position. Such Queen vs. pawn endgames can be very complicated and rule dependent (and these rules change as the pawn advances), and are far beyond anything a non-professional needs to study. Suffice it to say that if you keep in mind our one example and its rules, you'll have something to grasp onto if you're down material and this kind of defensive situation happens to arise. Blockade - Queen and Pawn vs. Rook and Two Pawns The weaker side can often draw by creating the same kind of blockade as we saw in Queen vs. Rook and Pawn. Diagram 3 1 9
[diagram]
Draw White draws easily by shuffling his Rook between e4 and g4. Black might eventually try to sacrifice his Queen for the Rook (on e4 or g4) and a pawn, but the resulting King and pawn vs. King and pawn endgame is easily drawn. It's important that the student is aware of this kind of blockade since it can occur from many positions that might, at first glance, appear hopeless. The following position shows a simple example of this.

Rook Endgames � A Rook and rook-pawn or knight-pawn on the 7th, with the stronger side's Rook in front of its pawn and the defending Rook behind the pawn, is drawn even if an extra knight-pawn or rook pawn exist on the other side of the board. � A Rook and rook-pawn or knight-pawn on the 7th, with the stronger side's Rook in front of its pawn and the defending Rook behind the pawn, is easily won if an extra bishop-pawn exists on the other side of the board. � Positions featuring Rook and two passed pawns vs. Rook and one passed pawn are usually winning for the two pawns. � In a Rook and pawn vs. Rook endgame, an inability to achieve a perfect Philidor defensive setup doesn't necessarily mean doom for the defender if his King is in front of the pawn and his Rook is actively placed behind it. � In a Rook and four vs. Rook and three, or Rook and three vs. Rook and two, or Rook and two vs. Rook and one with all the pawns on one side of the board, the defender's goals are to: • Trade as many pawns as possible (unless striving for a particular pawn exchange severely weakens your pawn formation). • Keep the Rook as active as possible (preferably tying the defender's King down to the defense of its pawns). • Keep trading down until you end up with a Philidor position, which we know from experience is a simple draw. 3 1 1

5.Kfl ! Kg7
Nothing works, since 5 . . . Rf2+ 6.Kgl Rxf5 7.Rb8 forces the win of black's Rook (or creates a new Queen), while 5 . . .g2+ 6.Kgl leaves Black unable to deal with the threat of f6-f7-f8.

White also wins after 7.f7 Rf2+ 8.Kgl Rxf7 9.Rh8+ Kxh8 1 0.a8=Q+, but why rush into a complex Queen vs. Rook position when the text move makes things easy? After 7.Kgl Black must resign since he has no answer to the threat of f7 and f8=Q. Diagram 324 a h c d t" f g h Tarrasch - Hollaender, Nuremberg 1 892 White to move Another seemingly ungraspable position is really just a prelude to yet another Flowchart puzzle. See if you can ascertain (or guess') what basic concept will ap pear on the board. Believe it or not, a King and pawn endgame featuring Fox in the Chicken Coup will soon appear! Optically White seems a bit better: his Bishop has possibilities along the h l a 8 diagonal, he possesses more central space, black's doubled c-pawns create a certain lack of flexibility, and black's a-pawn is weak.
P A R T S E V E N - E N D G A M E S F O R E X P E R T S ( 2 0 0 0 - 2 1 9 9 ) 327
Tactically though, things are even worse-the c6-pawn and the Knight are unprotected. White makes immediate use of these factors to either win a pawn or transition the game into an easily won King and pawn endgame. 1 .e5 ! Blasting open the h l-a8 diagonal. 1 .. .fxe5 1 . . . d5 2.c4! leads to a very unpleasant position for Black after 2 . . . fxe5 3.cxd5 c5 4.d6! cxd6 5.Bd5+ Kh8 6.Bc6 Rd8 7.Rxd6. For example 7 . . .Nb8 8.Rxd8 Rxd8

are weak and whose Knight is dominated, is completely lost.
2.Bxc6
Not only threatening the Knight, but also pinning it to the e8-Rook. 2 ...Re7 And not 2 . . .Rf7 ? 3 .Bd5 , winning the Exchange. 3 .Bxd7 Why exchange this nice Bishop for black's Knight? Because it forces the black Rook onto an unprotected square. 3 ... Rxd7 4.fxe5 Rxfl + 5.Kxfl Rf7+? This prevents the loss of a pawn, but allows a resignable King and pawn end game to arise. Instead, Black should have kept the Rooks on the board (It's still bad, but at least he can fight!) by 5 . . . d5 when 6.c4 (6.e6 Rd6 7 .e7 Kf7 8.Re l Ke8) 6 . . .d4 7.Ke2 Kf7 8.Kd3 Ke6 9.Ke4 c5 1 0.Rfl (stronger is 1 0.b4! cxb4 1 l .Rxd4) 1 0. . .

6.Kg2
And not 6.Ke2 ?? Re7 when Black is suddenly okay. 6 . . .dxe5 7.Rd8+ This final transition, taking the game into a King and pawn ending, is deci sive since white's queenside majority will ultimately leave him with a Fox in the Chicken Coup situation. 7 ...Rf8 8.Rxf8+ Kxf8 9.Kf3 Ke7 10.Ke4 Kd6 1 1 .h4!

Diagram 328 a h c d e f � h Tarrasch - Alapin, Ostend 1 905 White to move This is a Flowchart exercise. Try to turn this insane position into something we can understand from our basic endgame foundation. It seems odd to mention endgame transitions and Flowcharts when we're faced with a very sharp, complex middlegame position. Yet it's quite proper to do so since \.Vhite has the opportunity to end black's attack and reach a winning Rook endgame by sacrificing some of his excess material. 1 .f4!

It turns out that pushing the e-pawn would now b e a mistake, so \Vhite acti vates his Rook in search of new weaknesses to conquer. 5 ...Rb7 6.f5 !

Diagram 329 a h L d e f g h Topalov - Kramnik, Sofia 2005 White to move As White, what defensive ideas come to mind? These ideas should be word and concept based and not dependent on streams of variations. Don't fail to make use of your basic knowledge! Most players just calculate in these situations, without getting a grip on various defensive possibilities first. However, you can't find good moves if you don't have a verbal goal in mind. Bravo if you thought of some of the following things: It's an easy draw if White can exchange all the kingside pawns. If Black ends up with his pawn on a2 and Rook on a l (white's Rook behind the pawn on a7), it's a draw if White can trade his two pawns on e3 and g2 for black's f-pawn. If Black ends up with his pawn on a2 and Rook on al (white's Rook behind the pawn on a7), White loses if he trades his two pawns on e3 and g2 for black's h-pawn. If black's pawn gets to a2, white's King must be on h2 or g2 , or be in front of one of its pawns so a Rook check isn't possible. Black's kingside pawns are vulnerable. Attacking them will prove very annoymg. It turns out that attacking black's kingside pawns is very annoying indeed! 1 .e4 Kg6 2.g4 Ral 3.Kf4 White intends to attack black's pawns by Rb6 followed by e5 (taking advantage of the pin along the rank).

SOLUTION H Diagram 3 3 2 ;t h l d e f g h Smyslov - Korchnoi, Moscow vs. Leningrad 1 967 White to move This seems to be a complex position that has noth ing to do with the basics we 've studied thus far. Try and see how some of these basics might prove useful in this position. Remember, I'm looking for ideas, not moves. This position seems complicated and hard to define in terms of the basic lessons we've learned in this book. However, there are some key ideas we can grasp onto. We've seen many instances of weak pawns being attacked, so \Vhite would like to make black's pawn mass on the kingside as vulnerable as possible (you should always try to create new weaknesses in the enemy camp!). And, since White has a passed b-pawn, he should be aiming to advance it and force black's King and Rook to the queenside so they can deal with it. The idea of using the outside passed pawn should dredge up two more con cepts: placing the Rook behind its passed pawn and Fox in the Chicken Coup. You might find it odd to think of Fox in the Chicken Coup in the context of a Rook and pawn endgame, but it makes good sense and brings to mind two different scenarios: \Vhite's Rook gets behind the passed pawn, pushes it as far as possible, and if Black wins the pawn by taking it with his Rook (leading to a Rook exchange and black's King sitting somewhere on the b-file), \Vhite wins the resulting King and pawn endgame because his King is on the kingside, ready to eat black's pawns.

__ .. \Vhite sacrifices his b-pawn so that he can win a kingside pawn. The resulting Rook and kingside pawn vs. Rook endgame will be winning due to th e AWOL black King. 1 .Rc2 ! By defending the only two attackable points in white's camp (i.e., b2 and f2), white's King is relieved of guard duty and is thus free to march up to d4 or c4. 1 .. .Ke7 After l . . .e5, \Vhite would have moved his King to c4 and then pushed the b-pawn.
2.e4
This pawn advance, and the ultimate exchange of pawns that it leads to, will leave black's kingside pawns far more vulnerable than they were in the initial diagram. I'll discuss this move once the position crystallizes. 2 ...Ral 2 . . . fxe4 3.Ke3 Re1 + 4.Re2 picks up e4 (trading Rooks is an easy win for \Vhite) and leaves Black with two very weak pawns on e6 and g4.
3.Kd3 Kd6 4.exf5 exf5
Black's kingside pawns are now vulnerable to attack if the white King can reach f4 or e5 (clearly f5 is far easier for \Vhite to attack than e6 was).
5.Kc4
\Vhite would prefer to move his King to f4, but this isn't so easy to achieve since Ke3 is met by . . . Ra4. Due to this, \Vhite will calmly prepare to advance his b-pawn. Once that pawn gets moving, it will demand the attention of black's Rook and King which, hopefully, will allow white's King to attack black's king side pawns. 5 ...Kc6 6.Kd4+ Kd6 7.b3 Rel 8.Kc4 Kc6 9.Kd3 + Kd5 10.b4 Rbl Logically placing his Rook behind white's passed pawn. 1 1 .Kc3 Kc6 Black would prefer to play more aggressively via 1 1 . . .

As a result of this, black's King has to prepare to block the b-pawn. 1 2.Kd4+ Kd6 13 .Kc4 Kc6 Refusing to let white's King penetrate into his position.

A beautiful stalemate, discovered by IM Jack Peters. This section tightened up the material you already know, and showed you how to make use of your acquired knowledge to figure out positions that ap pear to be extremely complex. Having done this, you're more than ready for one final step. \\There in past sections I only wanted you to move on if you felt you had serious aspirations towards that next rating group, now I highly recommend you study Part Eight (Endgames for Masters) and Part Nine (Endgames for Pure Pleasure). \Vhy the change of heart? Because these final two parts of the book are concept driven-anyone who has mastered the material through Part Seven should find Parts Eight and Nine enlightening, easy to understand, and enjoyable. Let me extend my congratulations for your efforts thus far. You've come a long way, and now possess an impressive internal "endgame database." You're almost at the top of the mountain-there are only a few easy steps left to take. ou've finished Part Seven, and now you should have a rich foundation in all endgame basics. Of course, you will add to that knowledge by experience and any extra study you feel like doing. Though there is always a place for mastering complex positions-Rook and pawn, Queen and pawn, and King and pawn endgames have unlim ited depths-the need to shore up one's openings and add to one's middlegame skills forces the 2200 player to take a more practical approach. At this point "concept" (memorization finally takes a back seat to simple understanding) is the thing one needs to round out the endgame skills taught in this book's earlier parts. Here we'll focus on six concepts that will enable the master to play many kinds of endgames with depth and flair. 3 4 8 •. .
[diagram]
Weak players usually deal with one-move threats, while players who reach 2000 to 2200 try to imbue every move with a deeper, more expansive purpose. In a normal position, where the opponent is trying hard to show that his ideas and plans trump yours, every move should be filled with carefully crafted design. However, from time to time a player is blessed with a position where his op ponent is helpless-doomed to passively wait while the stronger side prepares the decisive break/thrust/maneuver/tactic. In such situations it's often a good idea to take your time, make small improvements in your position, and let the horror of the defender's seemingly endless defensive task slowly seep into his blown out, exhausted brain. This kind of "water torture" punishment is known in chess circles as Cat and Mouse. A strange rule of thumb is, "Do in ten what you can do in two." Lest you think I'm joking, consider this: taking your time and torturing an opponent is fun, but being the object of this torture is painful, depressing, and leads to a form of lobotomy that can linger for weeks afterwards. The ideas behind "do in ten what you can do in two" are: If you make some pointed move right away, your opponent will be expecting it and will take appropriate measures. However, if you dither about for a while before employing your grand scheme, he will be lulled into the aforementioned lobotomized state and miss anything and everything you are intending. Since your opponent is helpless, you have nothing to lose by showing your almost preternatural patience.

Optimizing your position before undertaking a decisive move forward has to be useful. Usually one doesn't have the luxury of wasting time in this fashion, but if you have carte blanche to tidy up every imperfection, why not take advantage of it? You might find that you're burning up too much time on the clock in an effort to find the final, winning maneuver. If another time control can be painlessly reached by treading water (thus giving added time in a safe fashion), grab the gift of free minutes with both hands! Our first example features two famous endgame aficionados-Grandmasters Pal Benko and Yuri Averbach-going head to head, with Benko relishing his ability to inflict long, slow torture on his esteemed foe. Diagram 3 5 1 Benko - Averbach, Portoroz 1 958 White to move Benko had this to say about the position: "Black's dream is to trade the b-pawns and the minor pieces and play a Rook ending with four vs. three on the kingside. Such an endgame is usually drawn. Dreams are one thing, though, and reality is quite another. I would never allow such a situation to come to pass." 1 .Nc5 Ra7 1 . . . Bxc5 2 .Rxc5 is winning for White because he has two advantages: his Rook is more active than its black counterpart (due to the need to defend b5), and he's a solid pawn up on the kingside.
2.Nd3 Rat+ 3.Kg2 Rd l 4.KB
White's winning plan is very simple: he intends to slowly improve his posi tion on the kingside (e3-e4, gaining space and defending the Rook, is a useful prelude), defend the Knight with his King (the immediate threat is Ke2), and then win the pawn on b5.

Are you getting a feel for the power of Cat and Mouse yet? Remember, the concepts in this chapter are not things to be memorized, they are ideas that need to be embraced. Since Benko is doing such a great job teaching us about the effectiveness of Cat and Mouse, I'll let him drive the message home by borrowing one more example from Pal Benko: My l.ife, Games, and Compositions. This time he Cat and Mouses one of the greatest endgame players of all time.

Benko - Smyslov, Zagreb 1959 White to move White, with an extra pawn, a superior King, and a strong Knight vs. a Bishop should win. However, it won't be easy. This is what Benko had to say: "The game was adjourned here and after analyzing at leisure, I realized the win would take quite a long time. If victory is to be achieved, the white King will have to find a way to penetrate. Unfortunately, black's King and Bishop make this difficult. As a result, I decided that it was time for a bit of Cat and Mouse: I would patiently maneuver, hoping to make Smyslov less alert. I knew that such long-term torture from a passive position would be very hard for Black to deal with, so I sat down and resumed the game ready for a lengthy siege."

Benko: "The first order of business is to push back the black King. It isn't optimal to place my pawn on a vulnerable white square, but I had no choice in the matter." I should add that, after l.f5+, Black is completely passive and can't do anything but go back and forth and hope that White can't find a way to finish him off. Such positions virtually scream for Cat and Mouse treatment! 1 . ..

A shock! Taking the Bishop leads to immediate stalemate.

Black's King can't scamper over the queenside due to the white Bishop's con trol over the d l -h5 diagonal, and black's Bishop isn't able to penetrate either, though he gives it one more shot. 2 . . .

Having accepted white's miracle defense (and that's an important emotional step, since a shock like white's stalemate defense can easily throw a player for a loop), Black calmly (and very, very patiently!) plans the following: He will swing his King around to g3 (which is where it came from earlier, by the way!). White's King would then be stuck keeping it out of the decisive f2 - and f4-squares. He will force his Bishop into white's camp by leaping into d 1 . Once that i s done, Black will make use of tempo moves and attacks against the white pawns to decisively penetrate with his King. --· If White tries to prevent this (i.e., black's Bishop reaching d l ) by placing his Bishop o n the d l -a4 diagonal, black's King will march to e 1 and reach a position where the Be2 stalemate defense is no longer possible (it needs to be on the dl-h5 diagonal). 5 .Bh5 Kgl 6.Be2 Forced.

I made Cat and Mouse the first topic in Part Eight since the idea of patience will overflow into many kinds of endgames. ....: In the middlegame, it's quite common to see a player saddling his opponent with as many weaknesses as possible. In general, it's hard to tear down a defensive position if there is only one weakness to attack. However, two or more weak nesses (these can be weak squares, weak pawns, material disadvantage-anything that causes a problem for the opponent) often spread the defense enough to allow breakthroughs to occur. Here's a nice middlegame example that spills over into the endgame. Diagram 366 a h c d e f g h Unzicker- Donner, Goteborg 1955 White to move White is clearly better thanks to his passed pawn (which can push to d6 at will) and the loosening of black's King position. However, the passed pawn alone won't win the game-another weakness will be needed to stretch black's defense to the breaking point. 1 .a4! Intending a5 followed by axb6, weakening the b6-pawn and the b5-square. In some lines the a-pawn might also march on to a6 where, with Nb5 to follow, it turns a7 into a target. 1 . . .a5? ! Too panicky! Now White has a strong passed pawn to push, a weak b6-pawn to attack, and a juicy b5-square to live on. More than enough to force a win.

However, White enjoys certain advantages that decisively tip the scales in his favor. Here's the short list: --� Superior King position. A passed c-pawn after a well timed c3-c4 push. --� Black's a6 pawn is a target that can be attacked if white's Rook is able to penetrate into the enemy position.

In the earlier position black's h-pawn could have advanced to the safe square on h6, which would have allowed black's King to rush over to the queenside and help stop the b-pawn. Now the h7-pawn is a permanent target and black's King is stuck doing guard duty in Siberia.

Euwe - van Does burgh, Dutch Championship 193 8 White to move Before moving on, I can imagine some of you screaming, "Wait a second! White's a pawn up and should be winning easily. Why bother using such an example?" This is a fair question, but I can answer it with a question of my own: "How often have you (meaning all of us) failed to convert such a decisive plus?" The beauty of this game is that White doesn't rest on his laurels, nor lose his concentration. In fact, he does what we all should learn to do in such a situation: Don't give the opponent any counterplay whatsoever and constantly strive to make new positional gains in the form of multiple enemy weaknesses. 1 .Qc5!

A strong move that forces the creation of a hole on b6 that, after a4-a 5, will freeze black's queenside pawns. Note that White isn't simply going to try and win by using his extra pawn.

One would think that King and pawn endgames would be easy to master since all the pieces have been traded. Doesn't the lack of mutual armies make things far less complicated? The answer to this is a resounding "no!" In fact, many King and pawn endgames are so complex that they even boggle the minds of the world's elite players. Due to this complexity, masters know that entering into any King and pawn endgame is an "all or nothing" decision. Leaping into one is perfectly okay (and often the only way to win or draw a game), but make sure you have a firm handle on the resulting position before doing so! The following examples are meant to do two things: --� Teach you to appreciate their beauty. --� Act as a warning. Consider it a "Danger Will Robinson, danger!" kind of thing. Don't ever enter a King and pawn endgame unless you have no choice, or are sure that it leads to the desired result. Diagram 376 Shirov - Grischuk, New Delhi 2000 Black to move

I don't know about you, but I have two thoughts whenever I look at this end game. One is, "It's very beautiful ." The other is, "My god! I would never have found any of that over the board!" The message should be clear: never enter a pawn endgame lightly.' Transposition into a pawn ending often marks the final stage of the opponent's demise. However, masters have learned to be very wary of all King and pawn endgames since strange, often unforeseen, complications can turn an easy win into a draw or even a loss! Diagram 3 84

Aron in - Smyslov, Moscow 19 5 1 White to move Most experienced masters would note the possibility of entering an appar ently winning King and pawn endgame with l .Rg8. However, their spider sense would tingle and they would hold off on such mass exchanges. Why should they trade? Their Knight is a monster, their pawns are safe, and their Rook is active. Compare that with black's garbage Bishop, his passive Rook, and his vulnerable pawns.
380 S I L M A N ' S C 0 M P L E T E E N D G A M E C 0 U R S E
One would expect such a strong player as Aronin to only go into a winning King and pawn endgame after tidying up the position. Thus, l .Ke2 , stopping black's Rook from penetrating into white's camp and also centralizing white's King, would easily win the game. 1 .Rg8? Kh7 2.Rxg7+?? White completely missed black's brilliant defensive trap. It's easy to miss! But why go into something that might tum complex when simple moves keep the win safely in hand? For example: 2 .Rb8 c5 3.Rc8 Kg6 4.Ke2 (the c-pawn isn't going anywhere) when Black will lose material without having any counterplay whatsoever. 2 . . . Rxg7 3 .Nxg7 Kxg7 4.g4 This was white's idea. It seems to end all kingside counterplay for Black since leaving the pawn on g4 results in a winning endgame for White, while taking en passant gives White a "winning" outside passed pawn. It is winning, isn't it? 4 ... hxg3 ! I guess it isn't! White had evidently hoped for 4 . . .Kf7 5.Ke2 Ke6 6.Kd3 Kd6

Are you convinced yet that almost any King and pawn endgame might turn out to be a minefield that you should think twice about before walking through? No? Yes? Let's look at a game won by IMJ ack Peters. The transition into a King and pawn endgame was the perfect solution here, but the calculation necessary to prove this is far from easy in an over the board situation. Diagram 3 86 a h c d e f g h S Hughes -J Peters, Los Angeles 1994 Black to move Queen and pawn endgames are notoriously difficult so, in the interest of mak ing his life easier, Black must consider the very forcing 1 . . . Qf3 when it's clear that, in the ensuing King and pawn endgame, both sides will eat each other's pawns. After a deep count it might seem that each side will promote with a resulting Queen and pawn vs. Queen endgame. Is that what Black wants, or is something else going on here? 1 . ..Qf3! It turns out that this is a dead win! But that decision can only be made if Black notices a subtle point at the end of a long, forcing sequence.

White doesn't have much choice. 2 .Qh4 Kxb3 is hopeless, 2 .Qc7 Qxf2+ is even worse, and 2 .Qgl Qh3 mate is the worst of all! 2 . . .gxf3 3.Kg3 Kxb3 4.Kxf3 Kxa4 5.Kg4 Kb5!

Akiko Uto - Tran, Paris 2005 White to move In the game, White avoided the King and pawn endgame and took a walk down the wrong path with l .Nd7+. The real questions concerning this position are: Is the King and pawn endgame worth considering after l .Nxd5? If White retains the Knight, who is better and why? The King and pawn endgame that arises after l .Nxd5 exd5 2 .g4 proves to be extremely interesting. Diagram 3 88
P A R T E I G H T - E N D G A M E S F 0 R M A S T E R S ( 2 2 0 0 - 2 3 9 9 ) 383
It seems that white's plan of creating a passed e- and h-pawn (which will be unstoppable due to their distance from each other) will give her the full point: 2 . . .d4 3 .h4 (and not 3 .f5?? g5 when the g-pawn stops two white pawns) 3 . . .Ke7
4.f5 followed by h5 when Black must resign.
Is it really that simple? Of course not! It's a pawn endgame and that means there are almost always surprising resources lurking behind the scenes. So let's try (after 2.g4) 2 . . . g5. A bit of analysis makes it clear that this is a dismal failure: 3 .fxg5 Ke7 (or 3 . . .Kg7 4.h4 Kg6 5.Kc3 Kg7 6.h5 Kh7 7.g6+ fxg6 8.e6 Kg7 9.h6+ and a pawn will queen) 4.h4 d4 (4 . . .Ke6 5.h5 Kxe5 6.h6 forces the promotion of the h-pawn) 5 .h5 Kf8 6.h6 Kg8 7 .g6! fxg6 8.e6, 1 -0. Can Black try . . . f7-f6 at some point? Let's see: 2.g4 Ke7 3 . h4 f6 4. h5! and we have a very pleasing pawn structure that guarantee's White success: 4 . . .g5 5 .h6 Kf7 6.e6+!, winning. How about 2.g4 f6! (threatening to win by 3 . . . fxe5 4.fxe5 g5!, fixing two pawns with one) when 3 .e6 Ke7 4.f5 g5, =. Are we on to something? Suppose White chops off the pawn after 2 . . . f6 3 .exf6 Kf7 4.g5. This paints a nice visual picture, but it's only a draw after 4 . . .d4 5.Ke2 c3 6.Kd3 Ke6-black's c- and cl-pawns handcuff white's King, while white's four kingside pawns are stopped by black's King and pawn. It seems we might have found a defense for Black, but one last calm look will give us the "answer": 2 . . . f6 3 .h4! fxe5 (3 . . .Ke7 is met by 4.h5) 4.fxe 5 Ke7 5.h5 and White's back in the win column. At this point I can see White snapping off black's Bishop and rushing into this endgame, confident that victory will be hers. However, we've missed something!

It turns out that Black can indeed achieve the sunny side of the diagram after

So it turns out that White can't do more than draw the King and pawn end game, once again confirming our adage that "all King and pawn endgames are confusing!" Instead, returning to diagram 3 87, an experienced player would quickly look over the mess we just explored and then refuse to make the ex change, even if he wasn't able to plumb the King and pawn endgame's depths. Why would he make this decision? Because it should be obvious that the minor piece endgame gives White a huge advantage with no risk whatsoever. From diagram 387:
1.Kc3
White fixes the c-pawn on c4 and ties down black's Bishop to its defense. 1 . ..Kg7
P A R T E I G H T - E N D G A M E S F O R M A S T E R S ( 2 2 0 0 - 2 3 9 9 ) 385
Moving towards the middle doesn't help: l . . .Ke7 2.g4 Kf8 3 .h4 Ke7 4.h5 gxh 5 5.gxh5 Kf8 6.h6.
2.h4!
This not only gets white's kingside majority into motion, but also stops all . . . g6-g5 based counterplay. 2 ...Kh6 3.g4 Kg7 and now White has many ways to win the game. She can take her time and play "fixer" moves like 4.a3 , or she can go into a winning King and pawn endgame by 4.Nxd 5 exd5 5.f5 (this is far superior to the King and pawn position we entered earlier-White will follow with h5 and promote one of her pawns), or White can go right for the win of material via 4.g5 Kf8
5.Nd7+ Ke7 6.Nb6 when Nxc4 can't be stopped.
After looking over this endgame, World Championship candidate Yasser Seirawan said: "My thought process would be that if the King and pawn ending was 'close,' White should start with l .Kc3 in order to always get the King and pawn ending she wants by handcuffing the d5-Bishop to the c4-pawn. As Black 'passes,' White advances her kingside pawns to g4 and h4, getting a position where black's King is on g7 before playing f4-f5. Then she can rranspose into the King and pawn ending. " Note that Seirawan made it clear that he would have no interest in entering a "close" position from a position of strength. In other words, why take risks when you can step into the King and pawn endgame on your own (highly fa vorable) terms? We've seen players of all strengths having trouble correctly assessing some very complicated King and pawn endgames. However, it's not uncommon for even world-class players to botch positions that should be well within their range to solve. Our next game, between the legendary Miguel Naj dorf and World Championship contender Henrique Mecking, is winning for Black, but he doesn't come close to winning it! Diagram 391

\Vhite has many good moves ( l .Rb5 and l .h4 are good choices), but offering a Rook exchange by l .Re5 is extremely tempting since, if the resulting King and pawn endgame is indeed a win, it would avoid the potential complications of a long, drawn out Rook endgame. Thus we come face to face with a common question: does entry into the King endgame make life easier, or are we setting ourselves up for some strange King and pawn endgame pitfall? 1 .Re5! Best, but the two sets o fdoubled isolated pawns will demand some skill from \Vhite before he gains the full point.

Our final example shows m e entering an extremely complex King and pawn endgame simply because it was my only chance for survival ! Diagram 397 a h c d e f g h Milat - Silman, National Open 1998 Black to move My opponent had been thrashing me for the whole game (White had missed at least one instant win), and the creation of various perpetual check themes was my last line of defense. After offering my opponent several bottles of free beer, which he refused (seemingly intent on winning the game), we reached the position in the diagram. Black has a choice between two legal moves, 1 . . . Kd7 and 1 . . .Ke7. Only one is playable. 1 . . . Ke7! The only good move, and it shows how selection between seemingly similar choices can have an enormous impact on a game's result. \Vhen faced with this kind of decision, you can't take it lightly. It's very important to hunker down and try and discern what the differences are, and how those differences will ultimately affect your chances. In this case, 1 . . .Kd7 ? ? would have led to a lost King and pawn endgame after 2.Qe6+! Qxe6 3 .fxe6+. Note that this move comes with check, meaning that Black must deal with the pawn immediately. Unfortunately, 3 . . .Kxe6 allows 4.g4 when Black would have a very inferior version of the actual game since black's kingside pawn majority would be crippled.
2.Qe6+! ?
At the time I was positive that this allowed m e to save myself, though much of that view was based on ignorance. I was more worried a bout 2. Qxh 7 + Kd6
3.Qb7 though I was pretty sure that 3 . . . Qd l + would give me sufficient play. I
reasoned that my King was active, white's King was vulnerable, and the white Queen was out of play and unable to stop perpetual check. \Vhether this re ally drew didn't matter at the time, the game had been going on for hours and

I began to think that I might even have winning chances ! At this point a well-known grandmaster happened to stroll by. He glanced at the position for a couple of minutes and walked away. Later he confided that he also thought that I was on top (two minutes isn't time enough for anyone to figure things out, but it does show that even a world class player won't find these positions easy). Now I began t o think. I thought and thought and thought and became more and more depressed as the minutes ticked by. Finally I convinced myself that I was lost. \Vhite can create an annoying outside passed pawn on the queenside. True, black's King is more active than white's but, during the game, I couldn't see how this was going to save me against best play! Cursing my luck, I struggled to find some saving scheme and finally came up with something. Notice that I didn't say "something good." 5 ... Ke5 At the time I thought this was very important. The idea is to meet 6.Ke3 with 6 . . . f4+. Unfortunately, it turns out that this check is a losing blunder. However, during the game I fully intended to play it! Embarrassing but true! Let's see why 6.Ke3 f4+ fails:

Position after 1 1 .. .Kd5 I really believed I was drawing here since 1 2 . Kd3 ?? is met by 12 . . . c4+. I happily rested in my fool 's paradise until I got home. Setting up this posi tion on a board, I immediately noticed that 1 2.c4+! wins: 1 2 . . . Kc6 1 3 .Kd3 Kb7

Fortunately, my opponent agreed with my incorrect assessment and tossed out:

Now the game was eventually agreed drawn due to a line I'd worked out when I played 5 . . .Ke5: 6 ...Kd5 7.Ke3 Kd6 8.Kd2 Kd5 9.Kc2 And not 9.Kd3 ?? c4+ ! when Black wins. 9 ...Kd6 10.Kd3 Kd5 11 .b4 Kc6 1 2.Kc4 cxb4 1 3.cxb4 b5+! 14.axb5+ Kb6 1 5.Kd5 Kxb5 16.Ke5 f4 17.gxf4 gxf4 1 8.Kxf4 Kxb4 1 9.Kf5 Kc5 20.Kf6 Kd6 21 .Kg7 Ke7 22.Kxh7 Kf7, 1h-1h. At the time I was impressed with myself. As already pointed out, though, my elation turned to self-loathing when I returned home. It seemed (incorrectly, as it turns out) that I was indeed lost after 6.Ke3. In a way, I was lucky to have been deluded. \Vho know what I would have done if I'd seen what was "really" going on? In this case, ignorance really was bliss. Now other voices started to join in on this King and pawn endgame de bate. First, IM Jack Peters offered up some new ideas from the position in diagram 400.

Then I found a bombshell waiting in my e-mail. A strong grandmaster (who wishes to remain anonymous) claimed that my analysis was completely flawed and that Black was better after all (that makes two grandmasters who were off their rocker!), though a draw would ultimately be the correct result! Shocked, I glanced at his e-mail "blindfolded" (as the years roll by, I get lazier and lazier and often don't bother looking at a chessboard) and took his word for it (yes, I too am influenced by a high rating!). Sending the analysis to IM John Watson, he lambasted me for listening to anyone (a very wise bit of criticism, by the way!). This prompted me to take a closer look and I immediately saw that the grandmaster was hallucinating.

Black's idea is to play . . .b6-b5. I must admit that I'd never considered such a plan.

The grandmaster claimed a Black win after 7. b4 Kd5 8.Kd3 f4 9 .a5 bxa5 (this analysis is horribly flawed.

IM Ron Burnett came back with a chal lenge: ''Just how does \Vhite win after 9.c4+?" Fortunately, Mr. Hummel had answered this several days earlier and saved me the trouble of doing any real work: 9.c4+ Kd6 (9 . . .Ke5 1 0.bxcS bxc5 1 1 .aS Kd6 1 2 .Ke4 is easy for \Vhite)
10.bS Ke5 1 l .Ke2 ! g4 (also hopeless is 1 1 .. .KfS 1 2 .aS) 1 2 .Kd3 and white's King
will penetrate to e4 and enjoy a feast. 7 . . .b5 I later discovered that this is a losing blunder but that Black could still draw with a correct seventh move, though I'm leaving that to the Master or near master (don't forget, this is a master section!) who is reading this analysis to figure it out for himself. After 7 . . .b5, our mystery grandmaster claims a draw by: 8.axb5+ Kxb5 9.Ke2 Kc6 1 0.g3 Kd5 1 l .Ke3 Ke5 1 2 .Kf3 Kd5.

Are international masters better endgame players than grandmasters? Was the grandmaster pulling my leg? Is there any meaning to unearth? I tend to think that the grandmasters in question were too lazy to give this position a serious look. But it does show that King and pawn endgames can be very tricky, and that anyone is capable of completely misjudging such a complicated situation. We're done with the adventure. It's time to see what the truth is: Diagram 402 a h 1· d e f g h Black to move and draw 5 . . • Ke5 As played in the actual game. At the last second, I also discovered that 5 . . .

This very important, but simple, move (found by Peters) was missed by a whole team of titled players.

Kd7 18.Kg7 Ke7 19.Kxh7 Kf7 and now the point of 14. . .f4! is clear: \Vhite doesn't have a tempo move that will enable him to regain the Opposition. Thus, the game is drawn (20.Kh8 Kg6 2 1 .Kg8! [2 1 . h7?? Kf7 , 0- 1] 2 1 . . .Kxh6 22 .Kf7 Kg5 2 3 .Ke6 Kg4 24.KeS, =). Remember, all this is merely meant to be a warning. The fact is, complex King and pawn endgames are a bit of a rarity and most masters (on up) love the idea of playing them. But they also know that such positions should be avoided if a safe, clear alternative is available. I constantly hear players arguing over the relative values of Bishops and Knights. Which is really the stronger piece? The majority of voices point to the Bishop as the superior entity. The following quote from Jose Raul Capablanca is particularly pointed: "The weaker the player, the more terrible the Knight is to him, but as a player increases in strength, the value of the Bishop becomes more evident to him and of course there is, or should be, a corresponding decrease in the value of the Knight as compared to the Bishop." That's all well and good, but then how do we explain the following game? Diagram 403 a h c d e g h Capablanca - Reshevsky, Nottingham 1 936 Black to move Note the holes on b4, c5 and d4, plus the weak pawn on d5. If Black plays "normally" ( . . .

\Vhite prevents black's plan and now intends to swing his King over to d4 with total control. Refusing to die passively, Black realizes his only counterplay is based on an . . . h5 advance. Thus . . .Kh7-g6 and . . . h5 will exchange pawns (always a good defensive idea in the endgame) and allow the King a measure of activity. 5 ...Kg7 6.Ke2 Kg6 7.Kd3 h5 8.gxh5+ Kxh5 9.Kd4 Kh4 10.Nxd5 Kg3 D iagram 404

The "explanation" for Capablanca's obvious favoritism towards Bishops while he used his Knight to good effect against Reshevsky is si mple: Bishops tend to be better in the majority of cases (i.e., open positions, passed pawn races where the Bishop's long-range abilities crush the slow Knight, etc.), but Knights have their own set of advantages: --· They can land on light and dark squares. This means that nothing is safe from them! --· Knights are more flexible than Bishops. Knights are often superior in closed positions.

--� Knight-hops confuse amateurs and masters alike! After I managed to draw a pawn down endgame (multiple pawns and two Knights each) against the strong IM Georgi Orlov, he lamented, "Hop, hop, hop! The Knights are hopping all over the place! How could I possibly figure out what was going on?" What this means is that the master has an open mind and understands that many positions are highly favorable for Knights. He might prefer the Bishop in a general sense, but won't hesitate to rush into a Knight vs. Bishop endgame if he feels the horse will reign supreme. Our next example shows what happens when a "Bishop is better than a Knight" mentality becomes set in stone (or in this case, in metal). D iagram 406 a b c <l e f g h Mephisto Computer - Silman, Los Angeles 1989 Black to move At the time, computers hadn't quite made their mark at the highest levels of tournament chess.

Though my loss to Deep Thought was traumatic (and costly!), I managed to uphold the integrity of the human race earlier in the same event against Me phisto. The game was a long, grueling affair that demanded accurate play and tremendous amounts of energy. I managed to win a pawn and began the long Cat and Mouse process of torturing the cursed bucket of bolts in the resulting endgame. In the diagrammed position, I played . . . 1 . . .Ba4

It was here that I discovered a glitch in the machine. Any experienced human would understand the tremendous flexibility of a Knight in such a position, but the machine was programmed to believe in the superiority of Bishops over Knights. Thus, it allowed me to take on b3 and enter a winning Knight vs. Bishop en<lgame.

Smyslov - Euwe, Groningen 1946 White to move Black is in serious trouble. The reasons for this: White's King is more active than black's. __._ The white Knight will dominate black's Bishop. Black has potential pawn weaknesses on c7, f6, and h5 (that weakness will move to g4 i f White plays f3 followed by fxg4). White will push his f-pawn to f3 , so that will only leave g3 in need of defense. Simply put: Black has far more weak pawns __._ than White does. In general two Knights don't work well together. However, in this case black's Knight is dominated and, if it moves, an exchange will take place that will leave

\Vhite with a crushing Knight versus a rather impotent Bishop. --� The c3-c4-c5 pawn lever allows \Vhite to break through on the queenside in many different variations. --� Correctly handling a Knight takes more skill than correctly handling a Bishop. As a result, lower rated players fear Knights-in a way, mastery of Knights is the test that separates the men from the boys. 1 .Kc2 Bel Smyslov analyzes 1 . . .Bg5 (intending to transpose into a King and pawn end game) and shows that it also loses: 2 .Kb3 Bxh4 3 .gxh4 Ne7 4.Nxe7 Kxe7 5.Kc4 f5 6.f3 f4 7.Kb5 Kd7 8.c4 Kd8 9.Kc6 Kc8 1 0.cS dxc5 1 1 .KxcS Kd7 1 2 .Kc4 Ke7 1 3 .Kb4 Kd6 14.KbS g3 1 5.Kb4 Ke7 (1 5 . . . c6 1 6.dxc6 Kxc6 1 7.Kc4 Kd6 1 8.KbS wins) 16.Kc4 Kd6 17.Kb5 Kd7 1 8.Kc5 Kc8 1 9.d6, winning all of black's pawns. Perhaps this is true, but John Watson feels that 5 . . .f5 is a bad move since it later deprives the e5-pawn of some much-needed protection. Instead, he rec ommends 5 . . .Kd7 6.Kb5 Ke7 7.Kc6 g3! 8.f3 (8.fxg3 f5!, =) 8 . . .Kd8 9.c4 Kc8

This fits nicely into the chapter, King and Pawn Endgames Are Confusing. \Vhatever the truth might be, our focus here is on the upcoming Knight vs. Bishop battle, which shows the Knight running rings around its "faster" foe.

\Vhite intends to play c4 and then march his King all the way to c6. Black would like to "greet" the white King by moving his own monarch to d7, but then Ng7 + followed by Nxh5 would follow.

However, I think Bernstein's choice is by far the more "human" move (Note that "human" doesn't necessarily mean "best. " It's just a good, practical decision). The idea is simple: He intends to move his King to d2 and then swap off all the Rooks. The resulting minor piece endgame is winning for \Vhite, while if Black retains a Rook he will allow \Vhite to invade the 7th rank. \\That's particularly nice about this plan is that there is no risk involved-\Vhite doesn't want to allow Black any counterplay. 9 ...f4+ 10.Kd2 Bf5 The alternative, 10 .. . b4, lets \Vhite decisively invade on the 7th rank: 1 l .cxb4 Rxd4+ 1 2.Kc3 Rxd l 1 3 .Rxd l Re3 + 14.Kc4 Re2 1 5.Rd7+ Ka8 1 6.Rc7 Rxg2

In my view, \Vhite can make this easy on himself if he realizes that he's a King up-black's King is frozen to the defense of a6. Thus, all \Vhite has to do is find a way to penetrate into black's camp with his King: 1 3 . . .h5 14.Kf2 h4 1 5.g3 fxg3+ 1 6.hxg3 hxg3+ (16. . . h3 1 7.g4 is easy) 1 7.Kxg3 Bc8 (Passive play offers no hope either: 1 7 . . .

Bxd3 1 9.Kxd3 c5 2 O.Rxf7 b4 2 1 .Rc7 is completely lost. The King is an extremely strong piece, but many players lose sight of this fact due to the necessity for it to hide during the middlegame. Experienced tournament competitors, though, are well aware of the need to let their King flex its muscles once an endgame is reached. In fact, many games are saved or won when one side manages to activate their King, while the other King sits smugly at home doing nothing. Though the "Use your King in an endgame!" concept is given regular lip service from class "D" on up, few realize just how important it is. Hopefully the examples that follow will boil your blood and make your want to reach for your King and kick it into dance mode. Diagram 414 a h c d e f g h Lilienthal - Smyslov, Leningrad 1941 Black to move The Bulgarian chess saying, "I make your pawns look like your grandmother's teeth," seems a good way to describe black's structure-his pawns are weak and many of them appear to be doomed.

Most young players today aren't familiar with Salo Flohr. That's a shame, since he was a powerful positional player and was also blessed with fantastic technique. In our next game, Flohr uses both his pieces (his King and Rook) to the maximum. His Rook seems to dance rings around its Black counterpart, while his King almost single-handedly rules the board. Diagram 4 1 8 a h c d e f g h Flohr - Petrov, Semmering 1 93 7 White to move A glance might convince some players that Black is doing well; he has a Rook on the 7th rank and a passed a-pawn. However, Black is actually in serious trouble. How can this be? How can a white advantage be logically explained? The answer is simple: \Vhite's pawn structure is superior, and his King will prove to be far more active than black's (which is too far away from the kingside to defend its pawns there)! 1 .Ra5! A very nice Rook maneuver. The threat against d5 forces black's reply. 1 . . .Rb5 2.Ra2! Now black's Rook is denied the 7th rank and f2 is no longer under attack.

White has just played his Rook to c l , which is a horrible mistake since it al lows Black to trade into a winning King and pawn endgame. 1 . . .Rxcl 2.Kxcl Why is this endgame winning for Black? Aside from his superior pawn struc ture, the answer is simple: Black s King will dominate white s! In general, you don't want to rush into a King and pawn endgame if your opponent's King can take up a far superior position to your own. 2 ...Kf6 Many players blindly rush their King to the center, which (I must admit) is usually the right thing to do. However, in this case black's superiority is on the kingside, so he makes a dash to that embattled area where it will target the pawns on h2, f2, and f3 for extinction. 3 .Kd2 Kg5 4.Ke2 White's King tries to shore up his weaknesses on the kingside, but the vast superiority of the black monarch will eventually drag him down.

Let's look at the following series of Kingless diagrams.

In all these diagrams, we have a position where each side has the same piece (Knight vs. Knight, Bishop vs. Bishop, or Rook vs. Rook), White is a pawn up, and the defender's piece is blocking the enemy passed pawn. In each case, the blockade of the passed pawn can't be broken. Let's compare the following Kingless diagram with the previous three:

Here's White can break black's blockade by Qb5/Qb4, Qc5, and Qc7. This series of four diagrams has shown us that, in positions with Bishop vs. Bishop, Knight vs. Knight, or Rook vs. Rook, without Kings or other pieces or pawns helping, a firm blockade can't be broken. However, in a Queen ending, this defensive blockade can easily be torn down by the stronger side's Queen and pawn.
RULE
Passed pawns have the greatest impact in Queen endgames because a blockade of an advanced passer is very difficult, if not impossible, to maintain. - - ; L i t. " ti lb 6 41 Jkti44, LC k3&t444.. ! lilJ.d i Al A t¥ . i4tk4C$4 2 . l. It . W ··' I The following examples should "brutally" push this rule home. Diagram 430 Ru LE In a Queen endgame, a passed pawn's value is dependent on how advanced it is. When both sides have passed pawns, the player with the fastest passer (even if he's a pawn or two behind) often has a marked advantage . .I .Q&Ak " Though Black is no less than four pawns ahead, white's single pawn on a6 is so powerful that Black is forced to scramble for the draw (1 . . .Qg5 + forces perpetual check).

Understanding the rule connected to diagram 430 allows you to save posi tions that appear lost, simply because you'll know that it's not a material count that matters, but rather the creation and subsequent speed of a passed pawn. Diagram 43 1
[diagram]
White to move and draw White is two pawns down, apparently for nothing. All of black's pawns are safe, his King is secure, and white's queenside majority seems to be going nowhere fast. But, as has already been stated, material often takes a back seat to passed pawns in Queen endgames. Since white's only plus is his queenside majority, he must create a passed pawn in that sector, no matter what the price!
1.Qd4+ Kg8
White's task is even easier after 1 . . .Kh7?? 2 .Qf4! when it's not clear how Black can save the game: 2 . . .Qb6 (2 . . .Qxf4 3 .gxf4 d4 4.Kg1 intending b6 is an easy win for White, while 2 . . . Qe8 3 .Qc7 is also grim for the second player.)

Since blocking a far advanced passed pawn is often impossible in a Queen endgame, the defender often resorts to perpetual check as his main "survival mode" weapon. To combat this, there are two basic ways for the stronger side to avoid the perpetual and try for the full point. --· Duel Purpose Queen: The Queen escorts the pawn down the board and simultaneously covers the only road available to its King.
424 S I L M A N ' S C O M P L E T E E N D G A M E C O U R S E
Doubled Pawn Protective Cover: The doubled pawns around the stronger side's King act as a wall, blocking any and all checks. Let's look at each of these concepts in action.
REMEMBER
The Queen has the ability to control the queening square of a passed pawn while simultaneously protecting its King, Diagram 434
[diagram]
Duel Purpose Queen White to move White's monster b-pawn will win the game unless Black can generate some counterplay against white's King. Black to move would allow 1 . . .Qdl + (1 . . .Qel+ 2 .Kh2 Qg3 + 3 .Kgl Qe l +, etc. is an immediate draw) 2 .Kh2 Qd6+ followed by 3 . . . Qxb6. However, the whole "King safety" problem can be taken care of by one simple move. 1 .Qc7! White's Queen becomes master of the h2-b8 diagonal (which means that when white's King moves to h2 it will be immune from harm) while simultane ously forcing through the b-pawn by b7 and b8=Q (the fact that it attacks f7 also doesn't hurt!),
1. .. Qel + 2.Kh2 Qa5
The only chance. 3 .Qxfi+ Kh8 Far easier for White is 3 . . .Kh6 4.Qf4+ g5 (4 .. .Kh7 5.b7) 5.Qd6+ with b7 to follow. By staying on the h2-b8 diagonal, White leaves Black no hope of saving the game.
4.Qe8+ Kh7 5.Qe7 +
And not 5.b7?? Qc7+ followed by 6 . . .Qxb7 . On e7 the Queen covers the c7- and e5-squares, making it hard to check along the sensitive h2-b8 diagonal. 5 . . . Kh6 6.Qxh4+

Note how the new Queen takes up the task of defending the diagonal. Diagram 43 5 a b c J e f g h Doubled Pawn Protective Cover White to move In this position white's doubled f-pawns form a perfect "anti-check seal" against the attentions of the black Queen. Note that if we took the doubled pawn on f3 and made it "healthy" by placing it on h2, Black would be able to annoy his opponent via checks on d5 and/or e4. Since the King is safe, White can go about the business of promoting his pawn. 1 .c6, 1 -0. Black can't bother white's King or stop the c-pawn's decisive advance. Let's see an il lustration of these ideas at the highest level. Diagram 436

Black's a solid pawn down, his c-pawn is loose, and white's Queen is more actively placed than black's. One might think that a superb endgame player like Rubinstein will reel in the full point, but Capablanca is aware of the principles illustrated in this section and knows that he must use his queenside pawn major ity to create a passed pawn or face certain defeat. If this calls for the sacrifice of another pawn or two, so be it! 1 .. .b4! Immediately striving to make a passed pawn.
2.c4!
This is white's best winning try. In the actual game White played 2 .Qxc5 when, after 2 . . .bxc3 3 .Qxc3 Qbl+ 4.Kh2 Qxa2 (the powerful passed a-pawn will soon force White to take a draw by perpetual check) 5 .Qc8+ Kh7 6.Qf5+ g6 7.Qf6 a5 8.g4 a4 9.h5 gxh5 1 0.Qf5+ Kg7 1 l .Qg5+ Kh7 1 2 .Qxh5+ Kg7, the game was agreed drawn. An instructive position arises that beautifully illustrates our "a passed pawn is more important than material" philosophy after 2.cxb4 Qxb4 3 .Qxa6 c4 4.Qa8+ Kh7 5.Qe4+ Kg8 6.Qe8+ Kh7 7 .Qxf7 c3 . Diagram 43 7 Even though White is ahead by three big pawns, the c-pawn is too strong White must take a perpetual check. 2 ...Qc8! Simply bad are 2 . . . a5?? 3 .

The idea behind 2 . . .Qc8 is twofold: Black intends both 3 . . .Qf5 with . . .Qb l and . . . Qxa2 to follow, and also 3 . . . a5 followed by 4 . . .a4 when a passed pawn will soon be born. 3 .Qb6 This freezes black's a-pawn and, apparently, ties black's Queen down to the defense of both a6 and c5 . 3 ...

4.Qxa6 Kh7!
Diagram 439 a h c d e f g h It's interesting how Black, now two pawns down, can play a quiet move like this and still assure himself of good chances. The idea behind 4 .. .Kh7 is clear:

he wants to avoid an unpleasant back rank check after the Queen eventually penetrates to b 1 or c2 .

5.Qb7 Qb l+ 6.Kh2 Qxa2 7.Qxf7 b3 8.Qh5+ Kg8 9.Qd5+ Kh7 10.QxcS b2 and
White should bail out with perpetual check. 5 . . .f6! Another calm move, telling White that he has no good way to improve his position. Also possible was 5 . . .Qe5 ! ? with the usual idea of giving up lots of pawns to create an advanced passed b-pawn.
6.Qe7
Also fine for Black is 6.Qa4 Qb l + 7.Kh2 Qb2 with annoying threats. The most dangerous move is probably 6.e4 when 6 . . . Qxe4?? 7.Qxc5 is win ning for White. However, 6 . . .Qe5! 7 .Qf7 Qal + 8.Kh2 Qxa2 gives Black enough counterplay to draw. 6 . . . Qbl + 7.Kh2 Qxa2 Diagram 440
8.Qe4+ Kh8 9.Qe8+ Kh7 10.QhS+ Kg8 1 1 .QxcS b3 when, as we've seen time

J::a 3: . . m en of the game? hi le Parts One through Eight are part of a detailed study program, Part Nine (Endgames for Pure Pleasure) is something anyone of any rating can enjoy. \Vho doesn't find the sight of an entombed or dominated minor piece almost comic in nature? And who doesn't stare in wonder at startling tactical thrusts in any phase My favorite "finding pleasure in the endgame" subject, though, surrounds the eternal "\Vho was the greatest of all time?" question. Here I picked five players whose endgame prowess is the stuff of legends. This allows us to analyze what part of the endgame each of the five excelled in, and see examples of endgame mastery at levels few will ever rival. Have fun! I hope the earlier parts of this book, and this section in particular, allow you to see the endgame as I do: mysterious, of great practical importance, and most of all beautiful. One of my favorite patterns in chess is the domination or actual entombing of an enemy minor piece. While rendering a piece helpless can often result in an uninteresting (one-sided) beating (due to the fact that the side with the en tombed piece is, for all intents and purposes, a piece down), at other times the paralysis of a piece creates a rather eye-pleasing effect. In general, pawns are the prison bars that entangle Bishops, leaving the once mighty pieces trapped in a tiny cell. Knights, on the other hand, can easily be come dominated (literally frozen) by Bishops. Of course, the noble steed isn't immune to the "pen-building" properties of the pawns and, like the Bishop, can easily find itself imprisoned in a cage. First, let's enjoy a medley of basic entombments and dominations. Di agram 44 1 78 � � �-·

Diagram 443 Black to play The game is completely drawn-the presence of Bishops of opposite colors, and the fact that both side's queenside pawns can't be threatened by the enemy minor piece, doesn't leave either player with anything to hope for.

The position in diagram 444 is clearly lost for White. Yes, the Bishop on c6 is a monster, and yes, Black has more space on the queenside and kingside.

Di agram 446 a h c J e f g h Eddy - Silman, Anchorage 1993 Black to move This position looks like it should be a fairly simple win for Black since he's in effect a Bishop ahead. Due to this, black's only real question is whether or not he can penetrate into the queenside with his King after the exchange of Rooks. If he can (while also retaining a queenside pawn), it's game over. If he can't, it might be a draw. Here are three typical positions that Black will be sure to avoid.

In the third diagram ( 449), black's King has managed to penetrate but all the queenside pawns are gone. This too, is a draw. With these failures in mind, black's play from our starting diagram ( 446) is easy to understand: he will exchange Rooks when his King can penetrate into the queenside, and he will be sure to retain a queenside pawn. l .. .a5 This gains space and also shows that Black is in no hurry. White is completely helpless so Black should only begin the decisive phase (i.e., trading the Rooks) after he's optimized his King and pawns.

Failing to embrace a true Cat and Mouse mentality. This well-intentioned but lazy (and hasty!) move allows White a bit of counterplay by Rd8.

Every World Champion and true World Championship Candidate was a giant among grandmas ters, and it must be stated that chess legends of this stature were magnificent at every stage of the game. But each player's style is unique, and each player tends to excel in one area more than others. For example, Alekhine, Tai, and Kasparov would head the list if we were searching for the greatest calculators and attackers. Petrosian and Karpov would be our choices if we were looking for sublime positional skills. On this list, though, we are limiting ourselves to those few who reached the highest heights in technique and endgame mastery. Such talent in this area of chess isn't merely learned; it requires a "feel," an artistic touch that few ever achieve. Putting together such a small list was anything but easy since a case can be made for the inclusion of several players. Who would have argued if I had placed Karpov here? And players like Alekhine, Botvinnik, Reshevsky, Petrosian, and Korchnoi also possess(ed) magnificent endgame skills. Ultimately, I decided to stick with the classical choices, Lasker, Rubinstein, and Capablanca, with the addition of Smyslov and Fischer. Hopefully, this sampling will inspire chess fans to read more about chess his tory, and to study the games of all the players I've just mentioned-Kasparov's My Great Predecessors series is an excellent way to do this. Remember that chess is more than just a competitive game. Its history is rich in pain and triumph, and the writings and games of the great masters can both inspire the student to new heights, and leave one in awe at the depth of artistic beauty they've created. Dr. Emanuel Lasker (1 868- 1 941), the legendary German World Champion who held the title from 1 894- 1 92 1 , had a rather unusual style. His openings were poor, and his middlegame play, while powerful, didn't have the fluid feel of Rubinstein's. His strengths, though, combined to create a player that dwarfed the world's best during his prime years, and instilled fear into the hearts of his competitors long after he gave up the crown to Capablanca. These strengths were: An untiring fighting spirit, endless optimism, a magnificent tactical vision, unsurpassed defensive skills, and an almost flawless command of the endgame. Our first example shows Lasker overwhelming Frank Marshall from a posi tion that the American attacking genius probably expected to draw. Somehow, Lasker made it look easy.

P A R T N I N E - E N D G A M E S F O R P U R E P L E A S U R E 467
Capablanca said, "In this position it is black's move. To a beginner the position may look like a draw, but the advanced player will realize immediately that there are great possibilities for Black to win, not only because he has the initiative, but because of white's underdeveloped queenside and the fact that a Bishop in such a position is better than a Knight. It will take some time for \Vhite to bring his Rook and Knight into the fray, and black can utilize it to obtain an advantage. There are two courses open to him. The most evident, and the one that most players would take, is to advance the pawn to c5 and c4 immediately in conjunc tion with the Bishop check at a6 and any other move that might be necessary with the black Rook. The other, more subtle, course was taken by Black." 1 . .. Rb8 2.b3 Rb5 ! The Rook i s very active on the 5 th rank, and can torment white's pawns by moving to a5, c5, e5 or even h5.
3.c4
This makes sense because it avoids attacks against c2 and also closes down the a6-fl diagonal (which black's Bishop might well have made use of). However, the resulting positions turn out to be remarkably difficult for \Vhite to deal with. Defenses like 3 .Nd2 Rc5 4.Nc4 Ba6 5.Ke2 Bxc4+ 6.bxc4 Rxc4 7.Kd3 Rc3 +
8.Kxd4 Rxc2, 3.Nd2 Rc5 4.c4 dxc3 5 .Nf3 , and 3.Nd2 Rc5 4.Nf3 Rxc2 5.Nxd4

Though he excelled in all kinds of endgames (as we've just seen!), his ability to save poor or even lost endgame positions has never been equaled through the span of chess history. Diagram 500

Lasker - Dus Chotimirski, Moscow 1 925 White to move Lasker's position is completely lost! Let's see what Reuben Fine had to say: "\Vhite's light-squared Bishop is stalemated, his pawn structure hopelessly weak, his other pieces (with the exception of the dark-squared Bishop) have little or no freedom. In such positions, Lasker's conception of chess as a struggle has valuable practical applications: Lasker makes the win as difficult as possible for his opponent, and he seizes upon any slight chance which his opponent may regard as unimportant." 1 .Rxe8+! An important move that cuts down o n black's options since now he must take back with his Bishop (l . . .Rxe8?? 2 .Bxb3 is something \Vhite can only dream or.).

The entombed Bishop on b 1 makes it seem that the position should be won by itself. Thus, it's understandable that Black didn't want to let white's pieces make noise after 2 . . . Bxb2 3.Ne3 Bg6 4.Bxd6 Re8 5.Nd5 (though 5 . . . Bd4-centralizing and stopping any d3-d4 nonsense-leaves White in a bad way). However, this hesitation to "wage war from a position of strength" ultimately comes back to haunt Black.

While this does favor Black (what doesn't?), White can answer 6 . . . Bf6 with 7.d4 when his position is far better than it initially was. Instead of all this delicacy on black's part, it was time for him to cash in with 3 . . . Bxb2 ! when 4.Nxf5 Bxa4 leads to complicated play (just what Black was try ing to avoid!), but both 5.Nxh6+ Kh8 (which is hopeless for White) and 5.Nxd6 Rf8 should ultimately allow Black to prevail. Note how Dus Chotimirski became lazy due to his crushing position, while Lasker's play forced his opponent to either wake up and play well or lose much of his advantage.

He still could have retained an advantage with 4 . . .Nf7, guarding d6 and h6, and also allowing the dark-squared Bishop to retreat if it's attacked by white's Knight.

Ral since White can't guard his Bishop with Rd l anymore) 8.cxd6 Nd7, but 9.Rf2 ! intending 10.Rfl seems fine. Black's last chance to keep some pressure was 7 . . . Be8! 8.cxd6 Nf7 9.Rdl Bb5 (and not 9 . . .Ral ? 1 0.Bc2 !), keeping . . . Ral in reserve.

Threatening Bc2 ! 9 . . . Bfi 10.Rel Also possible was 10.Bxh6, but that lets Black gain a tempo for queenside counterplay by 10 . . . aS 1 1 .Re l a4. One fun possibility is: 1 2 .BgS a3 1 3 .bxa3 Rxa3 (not 1 3 . . .b2 ? 1 4.Bh4) 14.Re7 Nf8 1 5.Rb7 Ral 16.Rb8 Be6 1 7.Bh6 Rxb l

Lasker's choice forces Black to deal with some straightforward threats-not an easy thing for Dus Chotimirski to face since his confidence was likely smashed to jelly by this time. 10.Rel is also safe since, in case of perfect Black play, White can always force a draw.

Poor Dus Chotimirski must have been emotionally devastated after this loss. Our final example sees our hero walking on the precipice of defeat. To save this game, he creates a problem-like draw over the board that had never been seen before. Diagram 503 a h c d e f g h Emanuel Lasker - Edward Lasker, New York 1924 White to move Visually \Vhite seems to be doing well-his two connected passed pawns seem very dangerous. The reality of the situation, though, is quite different. \Vhite's kingside pawns are far slower than one might suppose due to the Rook's defensive powers, while . . .a6-a5 will create a passed pawn for Black, which the Knight will have serious trouble dealing with. The immediate threat is l . . . Re8+ 2 .Kd4 Rd8, winning the pinned Knight. Thus, \Vhite moves it to safety. 1 .Ne3 Re8+ 2.Kd4 Rd8+ 3 .Ke4!? This keeps the King close to his kingside pawns. However, the published analysis of 3 .Kc3 ! ? doesn't seem particularly compelling. Edward Lasker said he intended 3 . . . a5 4.bxa5 Kc5 5.g5 b4+ 6.Kc2 b3+ 7.Kb2 Rd2 +. This analysis contains a couple flaws. The first blip is, instead of 5.g5, 5.Nc2, when I don't see how Black can win. However, even after 5.g5 b4+ 6.Kc2 b3+, \Vhite should avoid the blunder 7.Kb2 ?? and instead give 7.Kc3 a try when, once again, I'm not sure Black can force a win.

In My Great Predecessors, Part I, Kasparov or Plisetsky simply say, "If 3 .Kc3 , then 3 . . . Rd6! is unpleasant." The position after 4.g5 Kd7 5.f5 Ke8! (this King move avoids lots of unpleasant checks i n many variations) is a very interesting one. To say the position is "unpleasant" in diagram 504 is a bit funny, since the whole endgame is unpleasant for \Vhite, whether he plays 3 .Ke4 or 3 .Kc3 . The real question is, can Black win by force after 3 .Kc3? The idea of 3 . . .Rd6 is clear: to allow \Vhite to advance his pawns so they become vulnerable to attacks by black's Rook and King (The King will swing over to the kingside via . . .Kd7, . . . Ke7, etc.). To make matters worse, Knight moves will allow Black to target b4 by . . .Rc6+ followed by . . . Rc4. Naturally, 3 . . . Rd6 also allows black's King run to the kingside by stepping behind the Rook, thus keeping the cl-file a no-fly zone for white's King. Diagram 504

White to move One illustration of the problems \Vhite faces is: 6.Ng4 (6.Kc2 Rd4 7.Kc3 Rf4 really is extremely unpleasant!) 6 . . .Kf8 7.Ne3 Rd8 when \Vhite is in a mini-zugzwang since a Knight move allows . . .Rc8+ followed by . . .Rc4 while a King move lets the Rook into d4. Nevertheless, can even these facts guarantee victory? One important line: 8.Ng2 Rc8+ 9.Kd4! Rc4+ 10.KeS Rxb4 1 l .Nf4 and I don't believe Black can win. Diagram 505 a h c d e f g h

However, when I returned to the table, a rude shock awaited me." The only other move worth consideration is 1 6. . . Rb8.

I was afraid they might have already released it, for everyone had been telling them I had an easy win. Then I returned for another analysis of the position.

took over thirteen hours to complete! The great Polish Grandmaster Akiba Rubinstein ( 1 882- 1 96 1 ) is the only player on this list that wasn't a World Champion. Though one of the world's four or five strongest players from 1907 to 192 2 , his results from 1 907 to 1 9 1 1 demonstrated that he was second only to Lasker, and his total domination in 1 9 1 2 (four 1st prizes in four powerful events) led some to believe (then and now) that he was Lasker's superior at that time. A match between the two was finally arranged for October 19 14, but the advent of World War I prevented what would have been an amazing battle between two chess titans. \Vhat made Rubinstein great was his tremendous opening preparation, bal anced positional skills that allowed him to squeeze/attack/out-maneuver/push you off the board at will, and an unsurpassed mastery of Rook endgames. In particular, his credo of "Do not hurry! " served him very well in the endgame, as we'll soon see. Our first example is against no less an opponent than Emanuel Lasker!

Rubinstein made the decision to move his King to c5 instead of c4 because it's a much better practical decision. Here's why: He's in no hurry (don't forget Cat and Mouse!), he can play . . .Kc4-b3 whenever he wishes to. --� Why leave c6 undefended in some lines when you can safely move to b3 on your own terms? Why add to the amount of calculations you have to make by giving \Vhite a Rook check on d4? Note how Rubinstein refuses to give his opponent any counterplay at all! In some lines where black's Rook powers its way to the 7th rank, black's King will have the option of moving back to b6 or forward to c4. Thus, 3 6. . . Kc5 is more flexible than 3 6. . .

Black's last stand. His idea is to check along the 4th rank until white's King blocks its own pawn on f8. Then he'll capture the d4-pawn, give up his Rook for white's remaining pawn, and draw by running his b- or cl-pawn down the board as fast as he can.

Jose Raul Capablanca (born in Cuba in 1 888), is considered by most to have been the greatest natural talent in the history of the game. He didn't put much time into opening study, and much preferred a night on the town to the tedious task of chess analysis. Nevertheless, when he sat down to play, everything just seemed to magically "click." His plans and moves were crystal clear, and no less a player than Alekhine said that he had never seen anyone else with such a "flabbergasting quickness of chess comprehension." Looked upon as an unbeatable "chess machine," Capablanca was most fa mous for his endgame skills. However, he didn't play to reach an endgame per se; instead, Capablanca tended to see the whole game as one living organism, with whatever set of advantages he obtained often flowing logically right into an endgame.

This game shows that Capablanca had completely mastered the ideas of patience and avoidance of counterplay. White's three advantages: more active Rooks, space, and superior pawn structure. Apparently, this is all the Cuban genius needed to grind out a win. 1 .g4 White's Rooks look impressive on the half open f-file, but they can't do dam age if they can't penetrate into the hostile position. l .g4 is the first step towards that penetration, since a well-timed g4-g5 will blast open the f-file. 1 . . . b6 Intending to gain space via . . .c6-c5.
2.b4!
Nowadays this is a well-known idea in such positions. White's one pawn freezes the a6- and c6-pawns and effectively kills black's whole queenside pawn mass! In other words, one pawn kills four! 2 ... Kb7 3.Kf2 If there's no threat, then Capablanca will happily improve the position of his King. White's philosophy is clear: don't rush, stop all queenside counterplay, cen tralize the King, and slowly but surely prepare to blast open the f-file by g4-g5. 3 ... b5 An ugly looking move that creates a serious threat: Black wants to play . . .Kb6 followed by . . .a6-a5, with counterplay on the a-file.

remarkably easy. Okay, so Capablanca was able to make "lower tier" grandmasters like Marshall and Janowski look bad. How did he do against a monster like Lasker? Well, let's take a look! Capablanca had lost to Lasker in 1 9 1 4 and, due to the war, they didn't play again until a match for Lasker's title was arranged in 192 1 . To be fair to Lasker, he was no longer in his prime, out of practice, and suffered horribly from Cuba's stifling heat (Capablanca, of course, was well accustomed to it). After fourteen games, the Cuban challenger was leading four wins to none (two were lost by very basic blunders) and Lasker, on his doctor's advice, resigned the match, thus making Capablanca the new World Champion. Here was the situation (after the final game) in Lasker's own words: "Towards the end of the fourth hour, just before the time control, I was almost exhausted and with several obvious errors I ruined my entire strategic plan. I was look ing at the board as through a mist, and my head ached suspiciously. This was a warning to me, and I heeded it." Before you think that Capablanca was "given" the title by crushing a used up old man, consider this: three years later the best players on the planet competed in one of history's strongest events ever: New York 1924. Now fifty-five, the old lion shocked the world by winning the event with a mind-blowing score of 1 6-4, a point and a half ahead of the 2nd place finisher, Capablanca!

Comparing Capablanca and Lasker, an obvious question arises: "Who was the superior endgame player?" Let's allow Capablanca to share his opinion (given after a brilliant tournament victory in San Sebastian, 1 9 1 1): "The endings were up to the highest standards, some players thinking that I played them better than Lasker himself, until then reputed to have no equal. I do not believe that I played them better, but just as well." Born in 1 92 1 , Smyslov was the second in a long line of Soviet grandmasters to win the highest title. His autobiography titled, In Search of Harmony, sums up his style and his chess philosophy. Crediting his father for the skills he eventually became known for, I fi nd these words of Smyslov's to be extremely interesting: "He instilled in me a love for so-called 'simple' positions, with the participa tion of only a few pieces, I was able to gai n a deep feeling for w hat each piece is capable of, to sense their peculiarities, their strength and impotence in various different situations on the board, the limits of their capabilities, what they 'li ke' and what they 'don't like' and how they behave. Such a 'mutual understanding' with the pieces enables a player to see that which often remains concealed to purely logical analysis. It is then that the innate ability of a player, which I call a sense of harmony, manifests itself." With words like "simplici ty" and " harmony" being tossed about, it's easy to imagine Smyslov as a dry player who craved boring positions. However, noth ing can be farther from the truth . The 7 th World Champion was an excellent opening theoretician in his prime, and many new, dynamic ideas and even whole systems bear his name today. A positional player, he possesses a deep chess intuition that allows him to navigate complex looking situations with a minimum of calculation. 4 9 9

Though at home in both quiet and complicated middlegames, his main strength is the endgame, and he claimed that his talents in this phase di rectly attributed to his World Championship Match victory over Botvinnik in 1957. Smyslov's ability to find simple, to-the-point solutions to complicated end games is nicely demonstrated in our first example. Diagram 5 3 7 a h c d e f g h Smyslov - Xu Jun, Lucem 1985 White to move White is a pawn up, but the cl-pawn is firmly blocked (and in need of defense!) and his King is having trouble reaching the juicy pawn on h6. However, the 64-year-old endgame genius makes the process look easy. Some key points: White doesn't want to allow black's King to move to e5. Black can't let white's King land on e5, since then the blockade against the cl-pawn will be broken. --� Trading Bishops, even if it loses the cl-pawn, usually leads to a winning pawn endgame since white's King is closer to the h-pawn than black's is to the a-pawn. --� To win, White must figure out a way to safely get his King to f5 where it will target h6 for assassination. This goal can only be achieved through the use of zugzwang. 1 .Bf5! Temporarily breaking black's hold o n the f5-square and forcing the defender's Bishop to a less flexible diagonal. 1 . . .Ba6 Forced. Two quick ways to lose would be:

White i s better due to his more active King and his superior pawn structure (two pawn islands to black's three). To increase his advantage, White must place his Knight on g4 and his Bishop on c3, dominating the enemy Knight. Any trade of white's Bishop for black's Knight will increase the first player's chances because the black Bishop has very little mobility while the white Knight can dance to almost any square on the board. Once White gets his Bishop to c3 and his Knight to g4, the threat of Nf6 will force black's h-pawn to move to h5. This, in turn, weakens the g-pawn. When this is done, White will train his sights on g6 and, if necessary, freeze it in its tracks by h3 followed by g4-g5. 1 .Ndl ! Vacating the c3-square for the Bishop while intending t o swing the Knight to f2 -g4-f6. 1 . . .

,.,,,, Born in 1 94 3 , the legendary American grandmaster was an aggressive, "try to win at all costs" kind of player. Possessing opening preparation that was ahead of its time, the work ethic of an Alekhine, the technique of a Capablanca, and a will to win that terrified literally everyone he faced, Fischer bulldozed through the world's best players on his way to the highest title. Though Fischer played ultra-sharp openings like the King's Indian and the N ajdorf as Black, and l .e4 as White, don't make the mistake of pegging him as an attacking player-his was a style based on iron logic and deep positional ideas, and he was always happy to leap into an endgame, secure in the knowledge that few could challenge him in this stage of the game. Fischer's love of Bishops was well known, and his magnificent handling of them in the endgame has never been equaled. Our first example is an excellent illustration of Fischer's incredible chess education. 5 1 0

Diagram 549 a h c d e f g h Taimanov- Fischer, Buenos Aires 1 960 Black to move Poor Tai manov suffered in several games due to Fischer's skill in Bishop endgames. His comments, from his excellent book Taimanov s Selected Games, give us a taste for what he went through in the game: "I got into time trouble and before the control I missed a sure win. But in the adjourned position I still had winning chances-Fischer faced a difficult defense. My colleagues took bets: 'Bobby won't save the game, such accuracy is required! ' "And indeed, when after tactical complications the game went into a n ending, where Bobby was a pawn down, one sensed that the correct decisions would not come easily to Fischer, and that he was balancing on the edge of the abyss. But then the critical, most important position was reached, and . . . Bobby suddenly began playing quickly and faultlessly, like an automaton-he rattled off more than a dozen difficult moves within a minute, and the draw became inevitable. Stunned by such a finale, I asked him: 'Bobby, how did you manage to find this saving path, and so quickly?' 'I didn't need to find anything,' said the contented Fischer with a smile, 'a few years ago your magazine Shakhmaty v SSSR pub lished a detailed analysis of this ending by Averbakh, and I remembered all the variations perfectly well."'

Diagram 5 5 2 a h c d e f g h Fischer- Taimanov, Vancouver 1972 White to move White's advantage is clear: the Bishop is far more active than the Knight, white's Rook is more active than its counterpart, black's King has no way into the enemy position while white's has a path down the fl -a6 diagonal, and black's kingside pawns are all on light-squares, meaning they will be permanently vulnerable to attack by the Bishop. 1 .Bb5 Rd6 Black is hoping to trade Rooks and then swing his Knight to d6 where it will create a complete blockade by depriving white's King of access to the c4-square. White doesn't mind the swap of Rooks, but he'll only allow this to happen once he prevents the Knight maneuver to d6.

This perfect performance put Fischer up 4-0 in their match, which he ultimately won by the unheard of score of 6-0! Just in case you think that Fischer was a one minor piece kind of guy, let's see how he handles a Knight.

Diagram 5 5 6 a h c d e f g h Damjanovic - Fischer, Buenos Aires 1 970 Black to move Here we have a classic case of a flexible Knight vs. a "ghost" Bishop (i.e., a Bishop that can move all over the board without ever being able to make contact with an enemy piece or pawn).

And we've seen his enormous endgame knowledge. Let's finish our study of Fischer by taking a look at how he fares in an ultra-intense position when the pressure of a World Championship is hanging over his head. Diagram 5 59 a h c d e f g h Spassky - Fischer, World Championship, Reykjavik 1 972 White to move
520 S I L M A N ' S C 0 M P L E T E E N D G A M E C 0 U R S E
A very complicated position: White has a Bishop for three strong queenside pawns. This is obvious. What make things difficult to figure out are the fol lowing questions: With white's Rook (which eyes a I ), King and Bishop all defending the queenside, just how threatening are black's queenside passers? How big a part will black's fourth passed pawn on f5 play? White has the option of pushing his h-pawn and creating a passed pawn of his own. An interesting aside is that chess engines like Fritz and Deep Junior give Black an overwhelming advantage here (the poor things don't realize that the position is balanced, a draw being the proper outcome). That should give the reader a glimpse into just how hard it was to play this endgame correctly. 1 .h5! An excellent move. White understands that passive defense won't save the game, so he sacrifices a pawn (giving Black an unprecedented fifth passed pawn in the process!) in order to create his own passed g-pawn. 1 . ..c4 Creating the threat of . . .c3+ (blocking the Bishop's control of the a l -h8 di agonal) followed by . . .a I =Q. Black sees that he can capture white's pawn next move, since neither 2 .h6 nor 2 .hxg6 are playable (as shown in the note to white's second move).

However, instead of 5.Kc3 ??, 5.Bf6! is a hard nut to crack: 5 . . .Rd8+ 6.Kc3 Rd3 + 7.Kb2 Rg3 8.g7. Kasparov's answer to 4.Bxh4 is superior to Purdy's: 4.Bxh4 Rg8 5 .Rxa2 Rxg6

4 ...h3 5.Be7 Rg8 The following Botvinnik quote is quite interesting: "Fischer finds a paradoxical solution: he stalemates his own Rook, but blocks white's passed pawn and ties his Bishop to it. Now five passed pawns are fighting against the white Rook. Nothing similar had previously occurred in chess. Spassky was astounded and he lost. Soon Smyslov found a draw for White, but would he have found it at the board, sitting opposite Fischer?"

So far we've heard from Kasparov, Botvinnik, Gligoric, Purdy, and Soltis. We might as well let Smyslov toss his voice into the mix too: "An exceptionally original position: Black's Rook is shut out of the game, but the five(!) passed pawns guarantee him at least equal chances."

Now I 6.Rxc4 f2 I 7 .Rel fl =Q 1 8.Rxfl Kxfl doesn't give White time to chop off the b3-pawn.

However, if you've become addicted to endgame study and wish to continue your "technical" edu cation, the following books should prove both useful and enjoyable. Reference Fundamental Chess Endings by Karsten Muller and Frank Lamprecht. London: Gambit Publications, LTD, 200 1 . This encyclopedic tome i s the best reference book ever written o n the endgame, and will promise you some guidance no matter what kind of endgame situation you're looking for. Perfect for those that want a book that shows every possible kind of endgame, but don't expect heavy explanation or soul. Dvoretsky's Endgame Manual by Mark Dvoretsky. Milford, CT: Russell Enterprises, Inc., 2003. Okay, this isn't anything like Fundamental Chess Endings, which is a true ref er ence work. Dvoretsky's wonderful book covers an enormous amount of material though, and everything is explained and nicely presented. Many won't like me listing this as "reference." But, in my view, its size and complexity earn it a spot in this category. This isn't a book I would read from beginning to end. Instead, I would turn to a particular section whenever that subject interested me. Rook Endgames Practical Rook Endings by Victor Korchnoi. Zurich: Edition Olms, 1999. Though not as practical as Survival Guide to Rook Endings, Korchnoi's book is wonderfully complex and informative. The Survival Guide to Rook Endings by John Emms. London: Everyman Publishers, 1999.
