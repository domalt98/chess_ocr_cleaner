Not only because the game was held in high regard in the Soviet Union, but also because he was sure that it develops various skills that could be very useful. Today we have a lot of research that shows that this is indeed the case. He bought Averbakh and Beilin's journey to the Chess Kingdom, which we went through together; a chapter a day. A lot of the other players from my generation, Khalifman, Grischuk, lvanchuk and so on, also read this book early on in their careers. l\scp6ax UiCR.�Hrr Bnyremmax CTBHe taTHOC KOpon BC fBO One day when he came home from work, I showed no interest. He was quite puzzled and disappointed by my behaviour. He simply could not understand this shift. Eventually he found out that while he had been at work I had read the book all the way to the end. When I turned six we went on vacation to Crimea, at a lovely seaside resort. At the beach a lot of people used to play chess. I joined in and played a lot of blitz throughout the vacation. Although they were quite experienced players, I still managed to win a few games. One of the players was a friend of my father. He strongly recommended that I should be sent to work with an experienced trainer. This is how my chess career began. My father continued to follow my results and root for me until the end of his life. He kept scrapbooks and built up an extensive library throughout my career.
6 Positional Decision Making in Chess
My father also bought chess books for me. Back then, chess books in the Soviet Union were printed in 50- 1 00,000 copies. Even so, it was not enough to meet the demand. For example, Chess Informant was then printed in 30,000 copies. My father was surprised it was printed in such small numbers. To get my hands on the newest issues I would go to a bookshop that was located just around the corner from where we lived. There I could at times get my hands on books from Eastern Europe, East Germany, Hungary and Yugoslavia. I would work out more of less when the newest issue of Chess Informant would arrive and I knew at what time of the day new books were delivered to the shops. I would then hang around for hours, hoping that this would be the day the new issue would arrive. At that time they had an agreement with a few local chess clubs that they would get a copy for the half a dozen National Masters we had at that time. Otherwise there were only about five copies left for the rest of Minsk! After some years they knew me in the shop and would set aside the latest issue of Chess Informant for me, but only after I had shown my dedication! When I was nine I began a long match with my father, planned to be 30 games. At times he would blunder and I would tell him "Daddy, you are blundering" and would suggest another move he could make. Eventually the match was abandoned after 1 4 games. The following game is of course not a masterpiece seen through the eyes of a grandmaster, but it is still interesting to what extent you can see the style of the grandmaster in the choices of the nine-year-old boy. The two moments I would like you to pay special attention to are moves 1 7 and 24. On move 17 very strong is 1 7.g4!?, preparing 1 8.ll'lfS with a strong attack. But my approach was already then to squeeze my opponent. Probably I would play the same today, only now I would feel less proud about it! On move 24 I exchange the knight on e5 in order to put pressure on the weak d6-pawn. Shortly after this, my father found it hard to withstand the pressure and offered further concessions.

1-0 Although I was only a small child, the style of play is not so different from today. I showed the game to Vladimir Kramnik and he felt the same way. And when he showed me a game of his from his early childhood, I could also recognize his trademark style in that game. Hard-to-get books The two most difficult books to get your hands on at that time were My Sixty Memorable Games by Bobby Fischer and 50 Selected Games by Bent Larsen. My father did incredible things in order to acquire these books. First he identified people who had these books. Then he harassed them endlessly to find out what they wanted for them. He managed to exchange his way to 50 Selected Games by providing the owner with a detective story he really wanted. And for My Sixty Memorable Games he paid his way - 25 Roubles. This may not sound of a lot today, but at the time his meagre salary was something like 1 20 Roubles a month. 20% of his monthly income for a chess book! Rubinstein - by Razuvaev and Murakhveri This book could not have been written without the work of one of the best chess writers, Yuri Razuvaev, and his book on Rubinstein's games, co-authored with Murakhveri. I will write more about this in the next chapter. Jacob and I had a number of conversations about what we wanted to get from our collaboration on this project. I would think like a chess player, eager to show my best games. Jacob would think
8 Positional Decision Making in Chess
like a writer, eager to teach and entertain the reader. As he is leading the pen, his vision will no doubt be the stronger, which is not necessarily a bad thing. There was one thing chat we agreed would make this book more interesting - to reflect on the influence Rubinstein's games have had on my own games. I am not sure the connection will always be as obvious co the reader as it is to me, but I have cried to explain it in the best way possible. Rubinstein everywhere I am not one of those people who feel a need to pretend chat I am a genius or chat I invented everything on my own. I am proud of my accomplishments and I am proud of my games. The fact chat I had great help and support from a lot of people, such as my father, my trainers Albert Kapengut and Aleksandr Huzman, and most of all from my beautiful wife Maya, is not something I think diminishes my accomplishments; rather I hope chat the fact that these people dear to me have supported me for decades cells something positive about my value as a human being. It is from this viewpoint I write this book. I am past the youthful need to prove co others chat I understand chess, and ready to explain how chess is understood instead. So we have focused on how I chink about chess, in the hope chat it will help aspiring young players to improve, as well as bring joy to chess fans who simply want to enjoy the game more. And the cornerstone of my thought process was laid down by my role model, Akiba Rubinstein. Obviously I always tried to learn from all the great masters, but it was Rubinstein who made the biggest impact on me, closely followed by the games and writing of Efim Geller and Lev Polugaevsky. For this reason we will return to Rubinstein's games - as well as other games that inspired me - throughout this book to explain what the reasoning was for my choices when taking the critical decisions. And from there comes the title - Decision Making in Chess. Judge us on this! Unlike my first book, My Most Memorable Games (Olms 2005), the intention of this book is not to focus on the accuracy of the moves I made at the board, as shown by subsequent analysis, but on the thought process chat led to me finding chem in the first place. Obviously we have analysed the games and in the process discovered things that made me re-evaluate some games entirely; bur throughout we have focused on the reasons for the decisions and plans I made, and also the limitations of my chinking during the game. I hope the reader will find this approach interesting and that it will help you with your own game. Boris Gelfand Rishon Le Zion, April 20 1 5 Foreword by Jacob Aagaard I am the ghost writer for this book, though the word writer does not fully explain what I have been doing. I have analysed positions, asked questions, recorded che answers, typed in everything and applied my moderate experience with chess writing to improve the structure and order of what had been said. Although this is all work that a writer does, the most important element is missing. The ideas in this book and che reasoning behind them comes from Boris and not me. If you want to know what I think, please buy my books (and I mean that, please buy my books!). I have dreamed about being involved in a project like this for a very long time. As a grandmaster I understand quite a bit of what is happening in top-level games, but obviously my understanding of the game is not at the same level as a World Championship challenger. I have wanted to be able to use my skills as an experienced writer and trainer to ask the right questions and obtain insights from him that you would not get if he was writing the book himself. Actually, it was especially the "obvious" things chat fascinated me about this process. Whenever something was obvious to Boris, I knew that it might not be obvious co many others; and that his explanation would be very instructive. 7he authors in conversation at the Tromso Olympiad in 2014 1 0 Positional Decision Making i n Chess This position is the cleanest example. Boris Gelfand - Daniel Campora Cesme 2004 Boris quickly and confidently made his next few moves, and would not have spent any time explaining chem had I not asked him why he played as he played. The explanation was short, clean and crisp. It was also incredibly illuminating. See more on page 1 1 6. This has been one of the most interesting projects in my career and I want to thank Boris from the bottom of my heart for agreeing to work with me on it. Jacob Aagaard Glasgow, April 20 1 5 Chapter 1 Playing in the Style of Al<llla Rubinstein 1 2 Positional Decision Making in Chess In the Soviet Union there was a series of books called the "Black Series" with the games of the best players, eventually spanning 32 volumes. When I was nine my father bought the volume on Rubinstein by Razuvaev and Murakhveri (probably Razuvaev did the chess and Murakhveri wrote the biographical parts) . When I came home from school I got so excited by this new book chat I went through it all the way wichour a board. And when I came co the end, I started reading it from the beginning again! I also did this with other books of this series, such as the books about Geller, Fischer and Larsen. Bue the book on Rubinstein made a profound impression on me. As you can see from the game in the Introduction, I was already playing in the style of Akiba without knowing it! Later on I forged a special connection with Yury Razuvaev based on the common love for Rubinstein. We had a lot of conversations about the way Akiba influenced modern chess thinking and opening theory. Whenever I won a game in Rubinstein's style he would call me up and congratulate me! He would call me the "Akiba of our time", which was a most pleasant compliment. Even Game Six against Grischuk in Kazan 20 1 1 (which can be found in a later volume of this series), he claimed belonged to Rubinstein. Razuvaev said chat I had a gift for spotting thematic ideas and using chem to my advantage. Sadly Razuvaev was already terminally ill at that time. Nevertheless he was able to give me a lot of moral support. I would call him up co see how he was doing and he would refuse co talk about his health, instead focusing on the Candidates, emphasizing chat I had a good chance to win and so on. Razuvaev had a gift of explaining things deeply and at the same time using simple words. He was truly one of the greatest chess writers and thinkers we have ever been blessed with. As a trainer he worked with many of today's top players, such as Topalov, Tomashevsky, Laucier and former Women's World Champion Alexandra Kosteniuk. Of course we should not forget co mention Razuvaev's main achievement as a coach. In the 1 970s he was one of a small group chat helped the young rising star Anatoly Karpov to become World Champion. He was also captain of the gold-medal-winning Russian team in Manila 1 992. Rubinstein's Great Help Coincidentally I have played some of the best chess in my life in the Rubinstein Memorial. I missed a few opportunities in 1 997 and was second, but won the tournament in 1 998 and 2000. In 1 998 I scored one of my most memorable wins, with the Gelfand-Khalifman Variation against the Griinfeld. The game can be found in my first book My Most Memorable Games, but I do not chink it will scare away potential readers of chat book to give the highlight of the combination; a move I was very proud of finding.

1-0 Noe only did I play well in these tournaments; more importantly, this invitation came at a time in my career where I had received no invitations for six months and I believed my career to be in ruins. Bue I won this game and another great game, and suddenly I was back. My connection with Akiba is stronger than just this (as if this was not enough). I played in the Spanish League for four years, and I find it pleasing that the team chat invited me to play in Spain comes from the town where Rubinstein played one of his greatest tournaments in 1 9 1 2, the year in which he won five top tournaments. Moreover, he played one of his greatest games there. Akiba Rubinstein - Carl Schlechter San Sebastian 1 912

Schlechter was a very strong player, only a draw away from claiming the crown from Lasker in a World Championship match in 1 9 1 0. {It is disputed if he needed to win by two points. My advice is not to trust Wikipedia on this; no one really knows.) It is quite likely chat he was looking to draw this game, as being Black against Rubinstein was quite an uncomfortable task. Little did Schlechter know that this endgame is already quite poor for him. With his next few moves Rubinstein provokes weaknesses in the black position and penetrates it with his rooks. Black never manages to get active and White can steadily exploit his space advantage by squeezing Black on the kingside. The conversion of the advantage is performed with incredible accuracy. We can applaud the programmers who have created our time's strongest engines, chat they are able co find all of Rubinstein's moves and assess chem correctly as being the strongest. 13 . .Bb5!! a6 14.J.d3 gd8 15.ghcl b5 16J�c7 t!d7 17.Qe3 t!f6 IS.ties .Bd7

Chapter 1 - Playing in the Style of Akiba Rubinstein 15 Championship title. His main successes are in "daily life". I first talked to lvanchuk in 1 983 and we played for the first time in 1 985 in the Soviet under- 1 8 championship. I won the game, somewhere in the middle of the tournament, and managed to keep this advantage to the end. I have over a hundred games against lvanchuk in my database, but I have certainly not entered every game we have played. So including rapid, blindfold and all that stuff, we have played more than that altogether; each of them a world in its own right; always interesting and instructive. lvanchuk has so broad an opening repertoire; he can simply play everything. In the 20 1 3 Candidates tournament he surprised me with the Chigorin Defence, which is not often played in top tournaments. He got a good position, but later got into time trouble and lost. Against me he has played the Dutch, Benko Gambit, Queen's Indian, Slav, Semi-Slav, King's Indian and so on. We have probably played a game in every opening after 1 .d4.
1.�f'3 c5 2.c4
I have played a lot of games with these starting moves against lvanchuk. At times the move order varied a bit, but I think we have had seven games with 1 .ltif3 and 2.c4, with more than half of them around this time. I am not sure if he was using consistency as a surprise weapon against me or if he wanted to prove something. These positions have a lot of finesses and I think our games deepened the theory and the understanding of the move orders quite a bit. 2 ... �c6 3.d4 cxd4 4.�xd4 �f6 5.g3 �b6 Here I have gone everywhere with the knight.

9 ... .Bc5!? This was sort of a novelty. It had been played in a few games between strong amateurs, but I cannot say that I had considered it at all. A bit earlier the same year 9 ... .Be7 was played (by transposition) in Ivanchuk - Dominguez Perez, Linares 2009. The game developed well for White, although it was eventually drawn. le is not unusual for Ivanchuk to play the same positions from both sides, so it was not a great surprise. Ac this point I spent 24 minutes deciding how I wanted to develop my pieces. I think I found a good idea chat managed to put my opponent under pressure.
10.a3!
This is quite a subtle move with a number of points to it. IfWhite plays 1 0.tllc3, as Ivanchuk did against Dominguez, Black's bishop is ideally placed on c5. After 1 0. .. tllxc3 1 l .bxc3 O-O White is not able co put early pressure on che black queenside with tllc2-d4. White still has some play to compensate for the weak pawn, but he has no chance of an advantage. Another idea I considered was to play 1 0. .Bxd5 exd5 l 1 .tllc3, but after 1 l ...d4 1 2.tlla4 Wfb5 1 3.tllxc5 Wfxc5:
[diagram]
I think Black has a good version of the Tarrasch. The light squares around the white king are undefended and further weaknesses will not be difficult for Black to provoke. White has to seek equality quickly, if it is there at all!
1 O.e4 is of course one of the main challenges to
Black's set-up. After I O ... tlldb4 1 1 .tllxb4 .Bxb4 1 2.a3 it looks as if White is winning a tempo. Bue Black plays 1 2. .. .Bc5 1 3 .tllc3 .Bd4.
[diagram]
I could not see how co exploit this tempo gain at all. In this position e2-e4 looks like it has only succeeded in weakening the d4-square. This is the reason I went for 1 0.a3. This time around White has a real threat. He wants to go b2-b4 and e2-e4, pushing back the black pieces. This provoked quite a natural reaction from my opponent. ••• a5 Looking back at this move with not only the hindsight of knowing the course of the game, but also with the knowledge gained by challenging the assumptions we had during the game, this move looks less natural than it did at the time. Rather than looking like an obvious move, fighting for the control of the b4-square, it looks like a move we would make in a blitz game. Chapter 1 - Playing in the Style of Akiba Rubinstein 1 7 If we compare the time spent o n a2-a3 and ...a7-a5, we can see that White's move has deprived Black of the b4-square, while Black has defended against a threat that did not exist a move ago. In this way we can safely say that the inclusion of these two moves favoured White. Furthermore, as we shall see later on, moving the a-pawn has left the black b-pawn exposed. It is quite likely that it will have to go to b6 in order to let the c8-bishop join the game and here it will be much more exposed than the a7-pawn would have been, had it been the base of the queenside structure. But what about White's threat of gaining space in the centre. Surely this should be respected? During the game I was absolutely certain about this, but a lifetime of analysing my own games has taught me that we should always investigate our assumptions; go deeper and get closer to the truth of the position, which might at times turn out different than we expect it to. As you have probably guessed by now, analysis shows that Black should seriously consider playing:
10. ..
O-O!?
[diagram]
This of course allows White to push forward with: 1 1 .b4 Be7 But with the bishop aiming to go to f6 and with ...a7-a5 hanging in the air, things are not so simple. Please forgive me for going into a bit of detail. 1 2.e4! 1 2.i.xd5 l:!d8! ( 1 2 . .. exd5?! 1 3.tlJc3 is promising, although Black has some resources there as well) 1 3.tlJc3 i.f6 gives Black reasonable counterplay. 1 2. .. tlJf6 1 2. .. tlJc?!? This move looks a bit strange, but it is more ambitious than retreating to f6. White has to react with great urgency to create problems for his opponent. 1 3. .le3 ( 1 3.tlJc3 tlJb5 indicates that advancing the pawns on the queenside may have its drawbacks as well. Black is fighting for the d3- and c4-squares indirectly and the d4-square rather directly. To use a common cop-out: more analysis is needed.) 1 3. .. Wf a6
[diagram]
1 4.a4! tlJxb4 1 5.tlJxb4 i.xb4 1 6.Wfb3 Black will struggle to develop his pieces and the knight is suddenly poorly placed on c7. Maybe he can equalize, but it is not as easy as one might think at first. 1 3.tlJc3 This was what I was looking for. White is pushing his opponent backwards and has more space, but if we look carefully, we can see that Black has a slight lead in development and can use it to throw a knight in the direction of d3 or c4; squares weakened by the combination of fianchettoing the bishop and advancing the b- and e-pawns. 1 8 Positional Decision Making in Chess Still, analysis suggests chat White can fight for an advantage. 1 3. ..�d8 1 4.�e2

During a game the grandmaster will spend some trying to figure out the differences between the two, but he should also not spend too much time as he will need it later, when the problems can often be more concrete and have Chapter 1 - Playing in the Style of Akiba Rubinstein 1 9 to be solved accurately i n order not to cause great damage to his position. So, he will make what we can with fairness call an informed guess. Most often he will feel his way, based on his great experience. What chance did lvanchuk have ofpredicting that it was necessary to cover the h5-square in order to fight for equality? Basically none.

The weakness of the dark squares ( ...a5) is a problem that cannot easily be solved. However, Black also has positive things going on for him. I think White is slightly better. All this is of course something we were able to find after the game through deep analysis.

It is harder to play positions where you are a bit worse than those where you are a bit better. Every move has drawbacks and it is hard to determine which are the most serious ones. lvanchuk decided to solve his problems with the exposed queen, but White has quite a lead in development and the queen did to some extent contribute to the defence of the weakened squares on the queenside. 1 2. ..

This works less well now. 1 3.tt'Ba4 \Rb5 1 4.tt'Bxc5 Black now has to recapture on c5 immediately rather than first attacking the queen, as White could put his queen on h5, defending the c5-knight. Thanks to this difference, White can cause serious problems.

This is quite ambitious. Black wants to play ... b6, ...Ba6 and ... l:!d8, with active counterplay. Also possible is ...Ba7 followed by ...e5, again with a decent position for Black. So at this moment I thought for I I minutes and I believe I found a good idea, which in retrospect seems logical: if Black is playing with only a few pieces, it makes sense to exchange them so he is left only with undeveloped pieces. This is how I can explain it now. But during a game I just look for the best solution. It is a far more concrete process. This does not mean that the understanding is not important; only that it is more subconscious.
13.i.e3! b6
Ivanchuk tries to continue his plan. The endgame after I 3. ..Bxe3 I 4.tt:lxe3 WxdI I 5.l:!fxd I ± is quite depressing for Black. We can now see that ...a5 has weakened the position and that Black is in grave danger from manoeuvres such as tt:lc4-b6/d6 and e4-e5 followed by tt:le4-d6/c5. Note that Black cannot take on b2. After I4 ...Rxb2 I 5.l:!c l , White will win the game with I6.tt:lc4. To be honest, I was not fully aware that my advantage was as big as I now see it is. During a game this is often an irrelevant Chapter 1 - Playing in the Style of Akiba Rubinstein 21 consideration. You see that you have a nice position, that you can improve your pieces, so you go for it. What more do you need?
14.tlld4!
8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 I like this move very much, because the idea is really clear and strong. White exchanges all his opponent's developed pieces and leaves him with plenty of problems. Having said that, it was probably also strong to take on c5 and manoeuvre the knight from c2 to c4 via e3. But if you compare these plans, I think it makes most sense to play the more direct move, which feels more natural to me. Also, I do not think I should give him the d4-square. 14 ... YlYxdl 15J:Uxdl hd4? During the game I did not think that he had any alternatives to this move. The direct threat is lllxc6, followed by �xc5 and llla4, winning a pawn. But afterwards we should question the assumptions we make during a game. If! had infinite time to think about this during the game, I would probably have realized that Black could play prophylactically with l 5 ... E:b8!, which has the double function of defending the b6-pawn and providing counterplay against b2, in the event of an exchange on c5.
[diagram]
I cannot see that it would have changed a single move I made in the game (actually, I am not sure I want to change any of the moves I made at all) . So, the benefit of seeing it would have been limited. If he had played it, then it would have been time to think deeply about how to proceed. After something like 1 6.E:ac 1 �d7 Black is clearly worse, but White does not have a direct way to exploit his advantage. I am not sure what he should play here. Maybe something as simple as 1 7.f4 and 1 8.'kt>f2 with an obvious advantage, but no knockout blow will appear in the near future. Putting the rook on b8 keeps the tension, which is in Black's interests. In the game he fell in with my plan.

22 Positional Decision Making in Chess
White already has a clear advantage for simple reasons. He is way ahead in development and the b6-pawn is very weak. It is by no means easy for Black to defend it. It is chat simple. If Black castles, it is possible for White to play E:d6 and llla4, when after ...b6-b5 the knight comes to c5. After this the black bishop and knight cannot easily come into the game. If Black cries to push his b-pawn to b4, White will play a3-a4 and have ideas of .ifl -b5 and lllc5-b3. And any pawn push in the centre by Black fails to create counterplay and only leads to additional weaknesses.

i.d7 Black is trying to change the course of the game. If I play 1 8.E:ad l I am sure he intended to castle queenside. Maybe this is not that great, but I decided to avoid it all the same.

I9JM6 hg2 20.Qxg2 gbs We have reached maybe the last critical moment in the game. At this point I had to calculate accurately to ensure that the knight endgame was winning. As this was the case, I more or less forced him to enter it. You cannot do such things on feeling. On the contrary it is important to be very careful in this kind of situation. You can easily end up in a position where you have simplified so much that your advantage is no longer sufficient to win the game. This would be the worst scenario.
21 Jladl O-O
Black could also have tried 2 l ... h5 with the intention of ...h4 and getting the rook into the game in this way. Bue if this had been played in the game, maybe we would now be debating if Black should not have castled instead. Black's position is poor no matter what.

Qg6 45.Qd5 e4 46.Qxc6 1-0 It is of course surprising to win such an easy game against one of the strongest players in the world. But on the other hand, when you look through the game, it is not that easy to spot the mistakes. This is the second time I have annotated this game; the first time was just after the game, when I had my impressions and the quick suggestions of the engines to go by. These were wildly different from the annotations in this book. While we were working on them, we found quite a lot of resources for Black that neither I nor my opponent was anywhere close to seeing during the game. And this is exactly the point of the next topic. The Squeeze Rubinstein was not only good at winning better positions. He was also good at putting long lasting pressure on his opponent, exploiting a slight space advantage for example, and then just squeeze, squeeze and squeeze, until the opponent would break under the pressure. Because chess is after all a game that has to be played; and giving the opponent problems is what it is all about. The following game is an excellent demonstration of this.

Canal has played the opening somewhat passively, but has managed to get through it without significant scars. We should remember that this game was played 40-50 years before it was discovered how Black should play Hedgehog positions. Today we have great empirical material showing us how to play these positions with both colours; how many pieces to exchange, what to keep and so on. But in 1 929 the players were flying blind, trying to come up with their own ideas. It is my feeling that White would be better off keeping the knights on the board. It is not clear what good Black can do with his knight after something like 26.a3, which most grandmasters would probably play these days. In the game Canal goes out of his way to exchange knights, fixing his own a2-pawn as a weakness. The thinking is probably that without the knights there would be fewer tricks and manoeuvres to keep under control. Although this is questionable objectively, Canal shows excellent defensive skills in what Romanovsky referred to as the fourth phase; endings with queens and rooks, where the play is directed both towards queening pawns and attacking the king. Alekhine made a great contribution to this type of ending, greater than Rubinstein, but I still find Akiba's handling of the position Chapter 1 - Playing in the Style of Akiba Rubinstein 25 deeply impressive. Especially later on, when the king comes to the centre to free up the queen and join in the attack. But as said, this comes later.

i>g7 33. i>fl fH'8 Black has definitely made some progress. White's pawn structure is flexible, but full of weaknesses. Rubinstein plays slowly, squeezing his opponent. At this moment he is aiming to play .. .f4, creating weaknesses and most importantly fighting for the d4-square. Canal thus plays the only move he has at his disposal; not only preventing Black's idea, but also preparing to advance the d-pawn, creating a bit of counterplay.

White has defended really well and his position looks possible to hold at this point. This does not mean that he is not still under pressure; only that he is withstanding it sufficiently. Although not a household name today, Canal was considered one ofthe strongest players from South America between the two wars. He won a number of tournaments in the 1 920s and had a lifetime plus score against World Champion Max Euwe. He won a nice game against him as late as 1 948.
[diagram]
So things look okay for White, but once again Rubinstein proves his class by changing the nature of the position and posing his opponent new problems. The feeling of pressure that never ends must have been uncomfortable for Canal and undoubtedly he was also starting to get tired at this point. 48 ... £4!? 49.exf4 gxd4 50.gxd4 cxd4

26 Positional Decision Making in Chess
51Jld3?! The first of only two mistakes that lead to White's demise. At this point it was necessary to change the approach to the position and go from passive defence to active counterplay. White can fully equalize with the strike 5 l .f5!. If Black takes the pawn, White has ideas with Wi'e2!, attacking both the h5-pawn and threatening penetration on e6. I cannot see any reason Black would be better in this scenario. But also after 5 1 ...d3 52.Wi'e5 d2 it is limited what Black can actually do with his position. After something like 53.Wi'xb5 Wl'e7 54.fxg6t Rxg6 55.Rg2 White is not in any danger. His king will come to assist with dealing with the d-pawn, while Black will find it really difficult to defend against all the checks. Today we know that we should fight for counterplay like this; that we need to change the character of the game when we have the chance. But as we will see again and again in this book, it is not by any means easy to find the right moment for today's grandmasters either.

You can always ponder what it is a player overlooks. Usually it is something "obvious". He could have missed the concept of 59 ...

What we can see is that Rubinstein took the chance he had been looking for Chapter 1 - Playing in the Style of Akiba Rubinstein 27 over the last 40 moves. And after this he was relentless. 6UU4gc2!

Black forces a rransmon into a rook endgame. As we know from Mihail Marin's Learn from the Legends and Mark Dvorecsky's Endgame Manual, this is the phase where Rubinstein truly excelled. Even though Canal plays a lot of good moves, the position is lost and Rubinstein offers him no chances.

0-1 It is well known chat Botvinnik studied Rubinstein's games and learned a lot from chem. He won many games by squeezing his opponent, just like Rubinstein did in this game and many others. The Long Plan Nimzowitsch wrote about Rubinstein that what amazed him most about his games was the incredible length of the plans. When you look at games like these against Schlechter and Canal, you see chat Rubinstein's play in the opening, middlegame and endgame is connected. Everything is tied together in what looks like one long plan. You find a path in the beginning of the game and you follow it right the way to the end. Now I do not believe that it is possible to predict the way the game is going to go. Bue what made Rubinstein the master is that he developed his pieces, defined a goal and used all the possibilities on the way to achieving it, be they tactics or improving the position of his pieces. This is how I see it. And it is how I try to do it. Team Chess I do not play for a lot of teams, but I was involved with building up a team to compete in the Russian Team Championship together with Igor Burshtein, who is a big fan of chess and also the owner of probably the best chess magazine in the world, the famous Russian magazine 64. Our idea was to invite young talents to the team, such as Giri, Caruana, Wang Hao, Karjakin, Nepomniachtchi and many others. We did not have a big budget, but with this approach we managed to build a strong team. Another idea of the team was to only use players who like chess more than poker. This might sound silly, but in a lot of the other teams the preference between the two was probably a bit more balanced. I prefer to play in a team where the topic of conversation is the games we just played ...
28 Positional Decision Making in Chess
Later on the team merged with another for financial reasons. We won the Russian League twice and bronze in the European Club Cup once. Throughout most of its existence, the team was called '64', but after it merged it was called 'Moscow 64'. Burshtein eventually became too busy to be involved in the team, but it still continues. In 20 1 4 I could not play, but the team still took second place. A game in a team event is not too different from an individual game. But it is always nicer to play in a team where there is a good camaraderie rather than the strongest possible team. If you do not talk to each other after the game, what is the point of being in the same team? Fighting for the c-file - White against Vladimir Malakhov I have only played one game against Malakhov with a classical time control. We have also played a rapid game once, which is not in the databases. I have to admit that I do not know that much about him, but I can give my impressions all the same. If they are right, they might help people who will face him in the future. If they are wrong, they will perhaps benefit Malakhov! Either way, it will probably help the reader a bit in appreciating this game. Malakhov is to some extent the inventor of the style we now associate with Magnus Carlsen. He plays very strong technical chess and is able to outplay his opponents in flat positions. There are many players who are able to play well in positions where they have a slight advantage; but to be able to create something out of nothing is really a supernatural skill. Malakhov is also an accomplished nuclear physicist with connections to the physics department in Dubna, where his mother lectures. His father is also a physicist, as well as a keen chess player. I remember that I was especially impressed with the way he beat Evgeny Bareev in a game in the Queen's Gambit Accepted, also in the Russian Team Championship, this time in
2008. Bareev and I played for the same team
and at some point I was sure that the game would end in a draw. But Malakhov played on and eventually won. Although he is no longer that young, we should not forget that Bareev was once third in the world and in 2007 participated in the Candidates Matches, where he won in the first round against Judit Polgar. To outplay such a strong player from nothing is no small achievement.

Chapter 1 - Playing in the Style of Akiba Rubinstein 29 This ending is not only completely equal, but it is close to what we would call dead drawn. However, Malakhov is able to cook soup on a stone, and exploit the miniscule advantages that can be spotted only with a microscope. First of all White has the potential to create a little pressure because of a tiny space advantage. Secondly the a6-pawn has the potential to be slightly weaker than the pawn on a3, because of the placement of the bishops. Finally, and this will probably come as the biggest surprise to the uninitiated: the pawn on h6 can become weak. In the game Black should probably have defended slightly more aggressively on the kingside. In particular he should have looked for a possibility to put the pawn on h5 in order to exchange it. But it is also quite natural for Black to wait and see, before doing anything active. After all, he does not have to prove anything if he wants a draw: the status quo is quite satisfactory. Bareev decided to take the king to c7 in order to free his bishop. This is slightly in contradiction with the basic principles of the endgame, where you should focus on making the most out of your best pieces. And in almost all positions, the king is more effective than the minor pieces, as long as its safety can be guaranteed.
26.f4 Qd7 27.h4! Qc7 2s.Qn i.d7 29.h5!
We can see how Malakhov has fixed the h6-pawn. This is of course not a great achievement, but it is one tiny step towards creating problems for Black. 29 ... e5 30.Qf3 i.e6 31 .g3 A typical move for a technical player.

The problem is that the pawns on the kingside make the black dark-squared bishop bad too! It is rare that you see two good bishops against two bad bishops, but that seems to be the case here. 35 ... fxe5 36.e4 Bc4 37.g5 might also seem harmless, but it is a slight improvement for White as well. The game should not be too difficult for Black to hold, but even here White is able to create problems for Black to solve.

But when you are deciding how much risk you should take in your own game, you look over at the board next to you and feel assured that at least Evgeny is making a draw! Psychologically, there is a significant difference between playing a comfortably equal position with chances to press, and playing a slightly worse position. In the latter case, you may have to choose the right moment to change the course of the game in order to avoid falling under more substantial positional pressure.

[diagram]
4 ... a6 signifies the Chebanenko Variation. This opening is popular among players who like a simple repertoire where the number of concrete lines is limited, so they know more or less what they can expect. Black should be slightly worse, but on the upside his position is very solid. As such it fits very well to Malakhov's style and it is no surprise that he has played it consistently for the last decade. White has a great choice against this opening. I have personally switched a lot between
5.a4, 5.e3 and 5.c5. I used the last of these
in two great games, against Movsesian and Kiril Georgiev. These games can be found in the book of my best games, published by Olms. While 5.e3 is a natural developing move, both
5.c5 and 5.a4 are aimed against Black's main
plan: to play ... b5. 5.c5 is the most ambitious, but it is always good to be able to play more than one position. Intermezzo - Viacheslav Chebanenko would like to say a few words about Viacheslav Andreevich Chebanenko, who was a person who thought a lot about chess and made many contributions to the game. In particular he made an immense contribution to chess in his native Moldova, where he had a number of pupils, most famously Bologan and Gavrikov, though I think it is fair to say that every strong player coming out of Moldova was influenced by Chebanenko, either directly or indirectly. Chebanenko had a great influence on opening theory. From the white side he popularized 3 . .Bb5 against the Sicilian. His idea was in the Rossolimo, after 1 .e4 c5 2.tLlf3 tLlc6 3 . .Bb5, to take on c6 on the next move. These days it is the most common and most challenging continuation, which is played without giving it much thought. However, when Chebanenko taught this system to his pupils, everyone was criticizing him, calling it anti-positional to give Chapter I - Playing in the Style of Akiba Rubinstein 33 up the bishop for the knight. But Chebanenko was ahead of the trend. In the 1 980s Michael Oratovsky from Moldova participated in Kasparov's chess school and showed one of his games with this variation. Kasparov was instantly critical of playing like this, telling the student firmly that the bishop is better than the knight, but of course even he played it later on, like everyone else. It was also played against me at a critical moment in my career, when Viswanathan Anand used it successfully against me in our World Championship match in 20 1 2. Chebanenko also lent a hand to Petrosian ahead of his famous 1 97 1 Candidates Final match against Fischer, where Petrosian managed to catch the American out and gain a big advantage from the opening. To do this at the highest level is very rare indeed. Robert James Fischer - Tigran Petrosian Buenos Aires (1) I 971 I.e4 c5 2.�f3 e6 3.d4 cx:d4 4.�xd4 �c6

We will see this opening a number of times in this book, as apparently it is quite attractive to play this against me?! Most significantly, Anand used a version of this idea as his main weapon in our 20 1 2 match. You can find our games with this line from page 1 92. A lovely memorial Chebanenko died quite young. I met him a few times at junior competitions where he was helping his students. He was a very pleasant man and he truly loved chess. These days a rapid tournament is organized in his honour. In 20 14 the fifth edition of the Chebanenko Memorial saw Viktor Bologan win in front of such strong grandmasters as Malakhov, Shirov, Kuzubov, Lysyj and Svetushkin. The tournament is organized by Bologan and is sponsored by the president of the Moldovan Federation, Igor Dodoo. It is a wonderful way to remember Chebanenko. Back to the Malakhov game!

A terrible blunder that loses the game rapidly. Chapter 1 - Playing in the Style of Akiba Rubinstein 35 Another benefit of this move is that White can play a4-a5 or c4-c5 in some positions, getting a better structure on the queenside. We shall look more at this in the next game. 5 ...e6 6 . .Bg5

7 ...c5 The position resembles something from the Catalan. White has won a tempo, but he has used it to play a2-a4. In recent games it has looked as if the weakness of the b4-square is the defining feature of this position and that Black should be able to get enough counterplay. A lot of games have been played from this position and it is not yet clear if White is able to put pressure on Black. Incidentally Karjakin played differently against me in the Tai Memorial in 20 1 3: 7 ... llibd7

Despite being a pawn up, he still has problems to solve.) l 2 ... l:!b8 1 3.llide4 tllfd5 Black is probably absolutely fine here, but in the game Sergey sacrificed a pawn and later found it difficult to play actively enough to prove compensation; but then it was only a blitz game to decide the starting number. .. Gelfand - Karjakin, Moscow (blitz) 20 1 3. 6 ...a5 6 ... llibd7 7.e3 Ra5 is a modern version of the classical Cambridge Springs variation. The inclusion of ...a6 and a4 might not seem like a big difference, but in reality the position is simply different and should be approached on its own terms. However, I should say that even in the classical Cambridge Springs, an advantage does not necessarily lead to a win. I lost to Magnus Carlsen in the 20 1 3 London Candidates after getting a slight edge in the opening, without either of the a-pawns having been moved. I have had this position (with the subtle pawn pushes included) against both Aronian and Kamsky. The latter game was played in our 2007 Candidates match in Elista, and was drawn after a big fight.
7.e3 .Be7 s.gcl
This might look a little bit odd. The c-file is not about to be opened. But I already had decided to transfer my bishop to b 1 , as happened in the game. From b l the bishop is safe from the knight on b4 and at the same time it controls the e4-square. There is little doubt that Black is going to use the weakness of the b4-square by putting a knight there. Having said that, maybe 8.i.d3 is more natural. It should be said that theory has moved on a bit and that these days it is more typical to put the bishop on e2, the queen on b3, and quickly exchange the knight when it comes to b4. My occasional second and close friend Pavel Eljanov from Ukraine recently won a good game in this line, against guess who:

The main function of this move is to make space for the rook on d l , not to defend the c4-pawn.

I only wanted to play b2-b3 if Black put his bishop on a6 and forced me to do it. 12• • .

Black will be able to play ...c5 and equalize the game completely. The bishop on b I is out of the action in this position and the e4-square has become irrelevant. Bur this is not a very natural way for Black to play and neither Malakhov nor the other players who have had this position have played anything other than 1 2. .. Ba6. One of the main reasons why taking on c4 makes more sense here is because some pieces are exchanged and White's space advantage for that reason matters less. This is the way the opening goes; with good play Black should always equalize. When I was preparing for this game I had to choose between the various ideas I have against this opening. I remember that the computer said that this is a very innocent-looking system, but my feeling was that the position was much easier to play for White. It takes a special type of psychology to defend the black position.
[diagram]
Both players are following up on their intentions. Black now has to solve the problem of his bad bishop on c8. Chapter 1 -Playing in the Style of Akiba Rubinstein 37 But if you have this system in your repertoire, you should be ready co play such positions: passive, but solid. But another question is if you like the white position; and I do.
13.b3 lLJd7?!
This is quite passive. The knight is heading nowhere from d7. 13 ...c5 14.lLib5! shuts out the a6-bishop. White has won two tempos in this symmetric position, as che black a- and c-pawns have gone to the 4th rank in two steps. White is simply more active. The strongest move was 1 3. .. lLie4!, as it exchanges the knight, which otherwise has no function. White should not exchange the bishops: 14 . .Bf4! lLixc3 1 5.E!:xc3 c5 1 6.lLie5 f5
17.E!:d l You cannot prove it to the computer,
but I still chink White is a little better. He still enjoys the same space advantage and a lead in development. Objectively it is not much, but it does matter which side of the board you would prefer to sit on. White won in David - Dunis, Porz Barcares 2005.

14. .Bf4!
This is an important moment. It does not make sense to exchange the bishops, and since Black has no weaknesses, White should not rush into things with 1 4. .Bxe7 Wfxe7 1 5.e4, when Black can enjoy the benefits of his flexible structure. A serious option is I 5 ... dxc4 1 6.bxc4 e5 and White will soon find himself with a few weak pawns. Another way to make this decision is co understand that when you have a space advantage, you need to keep it. Exchanging pieces does not support this goal. Now White is threatening e3-e4, so Black's next move seems to be forced, after which Black loses a lot of his flexibility. For example, if he ever goes ...c6-c5, White can play lLib5 and the pawn on e6 stares to be a bit weak.
14. ..
fS The position has transposed into a Stonewall structure, where the formation of the black pawns usually means chat the bishop on g2 is worse than the "bad bishop" on a6, b7 or h5. I am not sure chat the white bishop is much better on b l , but as in the traditional Stonewall structure, we can exchange it. And here this is maybe a bit easier. 1 5J:Udl Of course it is not very likely chat the cl-file will open, but as Black does not have a lot of active moves, I do not believe that White loses anything by putting the rook on d I before executing his main plan. 1 5. .. .Bf6? The bishop has more or less no function here. Maybe it was played to cake control of the e5-square or to give the black queen space, but in reality White is threatening to execute a long plan and Black is doing nothing to counter it. Hard as it might be to imagine now, in the end this bishop becomes Black's worst piece and White wins the game by playing against it. Black should play I 5 ... E!:c8 and cake it easy.
38 Positional Decision Making in Chess
One of the engines suggests that Black should play for an active blockade with 1 5. ..g5 1 6.Bg3 g4 and then it wants White to put the knight on d2, which seems odd. Where it is going from there is not clear at all. This reminds me of a friend from my chess club in Minsk, National Master Sergey Begun, who had gone through all of Fischer's games and said that he never went backwards. If his pieces were attacked, he would look for a counterattack, rather than retreating. I was deeply impressed by this observation and since then I have always been on the lookout for counterattacks, whenever my pieces are attacked. 1 7.tt:le5 tt:lxe5 1 8.Bxe5 Bf6 19.Bf4 The white bishop might look like a bad bishop on paper, but it is still better than its counterpart. I do not know if White is objectively better here, but with more active possibilities and a safer king, I prefer his position.

It is possible to play 1 6. ..Be7, to improve the bishop and admit the mistake, but in reality no human would do so. After 1 7.tt:lxb4 Bxb4 1 8.Bd3 White is still ready to fight for the c-file and the c6-square.

When you have such a good position, you should be reluctant to give any counter-chances without a good reason. Another point I want to make is that I see nothing positive in the black position.

All of White's pieces are where they belong, so it is time to start the fight for the c-file. First we exchange Black's two best pieces. Chapter 1 - Playing in the Style of Akiba Rubinstein 39 It is not without dangers to take on b3, but probably he had to enter these perilous complications in order to change the course of the game. Of course if he had done so and lost, we could have said that he should have defended passively and not done anything desperate. I see this as an important feature of the great players: to be able to accurately judge when to wait and when to change the course of the game. It was one of Anand's great strengths when he was at his peak a decade ago. He was good at waiting and then spicing things up when necessary. It was my feeling that no one else had as good a sense for this as Anand did back then. After 1 8. .. '%Vxb3 I intended to play 1 9. .Bd6 threatening to trap the queen. Forced is: 19 ... dxc4 20.i.c2 '%Vb2
[diagram]
After 2 1 ..Bxf8 followed by e3-e4, White's position is much better. White's idea is to open the game with the black queen out of play on b2. Malakhov's decision can be explained by the fact that the he often plays the Chebanenko, an opening where you get accustomed to being a little passive and having slightly less space. A danger with playing such systems can be that you become immune to the danger signals - a bit like the metaphor of the boiling frog.

19.cx:d5
This was the move I spent most time on before move 40. Before you play such a committal move you need to seriously consider the implications. Obviously I did not think too far ahead, but I assessed the battle on the c-file carefully. It does not make sense to try to calculate too far in such a position. I saw that Black could put the queen on a3, without seeing a clear way to continue for myself. But all the features in the position are in my favour and Black has no active counterplay. This is all I need to make such a decision. As long as I see that I can improve my position, I go for it. 19 ... .Bxd3 20.�xd3 cx:d5 2l .gc2 White has completed the plan started with 1 6.tt:la2. 2l.. .�a3 Black does not want to concede the c-file without a fight. I should mention that I had not worked out how I would take control of the c-file. But with the many weaknesses in the black position and my better-placed pieces, I felt certain I would win this battle. What I had made sure of was that Black was unable to take control of the c-file.

Not being able to see what Black should do, I decided to improve my position on the kingside, with the aim of creating more weaknesses down the line. I do not remember with certainty, but I do not think I considered paying homage to Karpov - Unzicker, Nice (ol) 1 974:

42.tt'lh5 1 -0
Here I had the option to do exactly the same with 22.i.c7!.
[diagram]
White is considering taking control of the c-file with Ei:dc l , but more importantly, he can improve his position greatly with Rb5!. Black is in great trouble here, as none of the tricks work. 22 ... tt'lc5 23.dxc5 :B:xc7 24.cxb6 gives White a decisive advantage. For example 24 ... :B:xc2
25.Rxc2 Rd6 26.b7! :B:b8 27.Rc8t and it is
already time to resign. 22 ... :B:a7 also does not work, on account of
23.i.d6!, winning the exchange.
The i.c7! idea is also possible later on, but this is the optimal moment to play it. My understanding of this position is that if White wins the battle for the c-file, the game is over. Of course I probably missed this option altogether, but I had a plan and was happy to carry it out without resistance. Another interesting observation is that Black has lost all of the flexibility the opening was supposed to give him. 22 ...@f7 23.g4 g6 24. <tffg2 The most natural follow-up, although it was slightly more accurate to play 24.�h2!, just to keep the option of gxf5 and :B:g 1 open. It is very unlikely that White would actually do this, but it could be useful to scare Black a bit with this idea as well. Chapter I - Playing in the Style of Akiba Rubinstein 41 But we should also be careful when we play like this. White has several good plans at his disposal and though it might be good to spook Black a little, we should make a clear decision for ourselves and then follow it through.
24. .. i>e8
[diagram]
White has improved his position to the maximum and it is time to come up with a concrete plan. So this is the moment where I found a way to put extra pressure on the c-file. Again, this is all I need to make such a decision. Once the position is improved, it will be time to make another decision.

29 ... Ei:xc2 30.Rxc2 <iid7 was suggested as a better defensive option by Hubner. The idea is chat the king comes to fight for the c-file, but White has 3 1 .Re2! and Black is struggling. If Black puts the knight on c6, White can invade on a6 with the queen. There are simply too many weaknesses.
[diagram]
30.gS!
When playing this I calculated a good way into the endgame, to around move 38, which I thought was a winning position. There are too many weaknesses and too great a space advantage. It is quite natural in such a position, after carrying out his strategic intentions, chat White looks seriously at the forcing options; here this means the transition into a minor piece ending. I should add that the g4-g5 push comes at just the right moment, when the bishop cannot go to e7, as it could if White exchanged the major pieces first.

Black is under pressure. One tactical point is that 33 ... ciie7? is met with 34.Rc6! and White wins directly, as the pawn ending cannot be held. And after 33 ... ciie8 34.f4 White dominates the board and will slowly invade the black position. In a sense, the above tactic is irrelevant because White can slowly invade whether the king is on e7 or e8. The only thing to look out for is if Black is able to create counterplay and maybe give perpetual check. If White plays well, this will not happen, but the presence of the queens does carry a slight risk that White needs to pay attention to.

Queen endings are of course a bit riskier than other endings, in that the defensive side can often make a draw by perpetual check, which is not a frequent occurrence in other endings. For example, in my Candidates match against Michael Adams in 1 994, I failed to win a queen ending, which temporarily caused a unbalanced view of queen endings in my subconscious. In the subsequent match against Kramnik in Sanghi Nagar 1 994, I could have transposed into a winning queen ending, but was reluctant, keeping on the rooks. Vladimir managed to find a great stalemate trap in his analysis and held the game. That ending is on page 246 in My Most Memorable Games. 32 ... 'itixc8 33.i.xbS 'itixb8 White is still in the process of carrying out his strategic operation. Notice that the black bishop is utterly useless on h8, despite being a so-called good bishop. The space advantage is considerable and the black king is very far away. Had the king been on e7, Black would be quite close to a draw, but e7 is quite a long journey at the moment!

With the threat of hxg6 and ltJh4, Black has no choice but to take the pawn. 35 ...gxh5 36.'itig3 i.g7 37.'itih4 'itid6 3S.'itixh5 Chapter I - Playing in the Style of Akiba Rubinstein 43 This is as far as I had planned ahead. I did not have a clear plan of how to break through, but from experience I know that with so many weaknesses, a fortress is unrealizable. The next two moves were made simply to make it to move 40. I was not really in time trouble, but it is good to do things the right way, even when you are not in desperate need to do so, just to create a habit of following best practice. 38 ... .tm 39.tlle5 .Bg7 40.�d3 rlle7

Here I spent quite a bit of time. First of all, even if you have enough time approaching the time control, you will inevitably get some heightened emotions approaching move 40. It is almost always very useful to calm down before making more decisions. Chess history is full of big mistakes made on move 4 1 or 42, probably because of adrenaline and other hormones impacting the brain in a way that does not work well together with making long-sighted rational decisions. Secondly, there is no reason not to invest the time in understanding the position at a deeper level, which here means working out a clear win. This is what I did here. I played rather quickly later on. White has to make a decision about how he wants to break the black defence. And I think I managed to find the most natural and convincing way. Basically I just want to get the king to g6 and squeeze. I also wanted to make sure that the bishop was unable to break free and attack the e3-pawn. White would probably still be more comfortable, but if it can be prevented, it should be. You also have to realize that you will have to make a decision, find a way to advance. What I was looking for here was total domination. Black is never in time to create any kind of counterplay.

Black resigned. He is in zugzwang and cannot prevent the exchange of minor pieces. Thereafter White wins with a simple zugzwang, pushing the black king further and further away until it can no longer defend the e6-pawn. The line goes like this: 50 ...Qf7 5 1 .Qh7 .Bf6 52.lllxf6 Qxf6 53.Qg8 <:J;;e? 54.Qg7 and so on. Classical Plans Up to this point the influence I have felt from Akiba has been rather abstract. And it will continue to be so throughout the book. Unlike other sports, chess involves a good deal of repetition in general ideas and in how we structure our thoughts. But we also have patterns that happen on the board. Unlike tennis, which I enjoyed playing before my knees asked me to stop, we do not try to repeat the same movements again and again in chess. In order for us to hone our skills, we need to train them in unknown positions. Still it is very useful to know a lot of classical games and classical plans. You never know when some patterns will become useful in your own game. Take the following interesting Rubinstein game, which is instructive for two reasons. In abstract form there is the principle of two weaknesses: how Akiba improves his position on the queenside and then switches his play to the kingside. He did this kind of thing continually in his games and it obviously made a great impression on me. The visual pattern also stayed with me. A knight on a5 attacking pawns on b7 and c6 is a powerful image. 8 � 7 ''�'• 6

Obviously he is happy with the knight on a5, but on the other hand the e3-pawn is a bit soft and Black is quite decently placed. It would have been interesting to see how Rubinstein would have handled the white pieces.

Despite being a pawn down, Black holds this pawn ending. Chapter 1 - Playing in the Style of Akiba Rubinstein 47 This all looks quite hairy for Black and we should not forget Larsen's mantra, Long variation - Wrong variation. It is quite certain that there are improvements for both sides along the way. But what I wanted to illustrate with this long variation was the path the game could have taken, had Black attempted to defend actively. Compare this with how the game developed and you will see that although it looks scary, it was the only sensible way to play the position.

Rubinstein has achieved what he was looking for all along. White has permanent pressure against b7 and if Black ever manages to play ...b7-b6, the c6-pawn will be weak and there will be an excellent square on c5 available for the white knight. It is possible that Takacs went into this position thinking that he could hold it, as b7 is not that difficult to defend. But then he did not have the advantage of studying Rubinstein's collected games! It was only years later that they were available in book form. 30 ...Qe7 3 1.:Sb2 Qd7 32.ilebl Qc8 33.Qe2 i:!e7

White has achieved all he can on the queenside. Standard theory on endgame technique tells us that you need to provoke a second weakness. In this case it is logical to do so on the kingside. And this is indeed where Rubinstein turned his attention.

A very concrete move that Rubinstein no doubt calculated deeply. Still, I am not entirely convinced it fits in with "best practice".

1-0 I see myself as a well-educated player and am always happy when I am able co play games chat show this. The following game is quite interesting from this perspective. In it I managed co play the entire game based not only on one idea, but on the same idea as the above game. The b7/c6-pawns are fixed and vulnerable and I managed co gee a knight co a5. Boris Gelfand - Alexander Morozevich Astana 2001 Alexander Morozevich is a highly creative grandmaster from Moscow. He has always gone his own way and cried co reinvent the game of chess, which at times is very impressive, but at other times has been a liability for him. He played in the World Championship tournaments in 2005 and 2007 and peaked in the world rankings in 2008 where he was placed 2nd. He has not done as well in recent years, but is still often found either just inside or just outside the cop ten. le is well known chat Morozevich played a lot of training games with Chapter 1 - Playing in the Style of Akiba Rubinstein 49 friends and trainers, in person or online. In 200 1 when this game was played, Morozevich had just emerged in the World elite and this was how he did it. He played rare openings, often provocative and dubious-looking. But he had analysed them deeply and as said, gathered a lot of practical experience in training games. Probably people remember his 1 1 ...g5 in the Slav, which is now the main line. He played the Chigorin and in the French he popularized some sharp variations with ... gxf6 in the Burn Variation. His contribution to opening theory in that period was huge and is still felt today, especially through the style of preparation, involving very risky and concrete play, but also creating big problems for the opponent to solve, if he wants to try to refute it. The opponent is forced to think independently and play very energetically from the beginning, as in this game.
1.d4 d5 2.c4 c6 3.tlic3 tlif6 4.tlif3 a6
Again the Chebanenko Variation. At the time this game was played, this variation was quite novel and the ideas of it not yet fully mapped out. At first it was developed by especially Bologan, but later on both Kasparov and Topalov played it for a while, adding a lot of new ideas to the theory. Comparing with this game it makes sense to illustrate Black's idea based on 4 ... .Bf5, which is met by: 5.cxd5! (5.Wfb3 Wfb6 is known to cause Black fewer problems; but in the game the a-pawn has moved and the queen would no longer be defended.) 5 ...cxd5 6.Wfb3
[diagram]
Black cannot defend both the b-pawn and cl-pawn with any of the moves that he wants to make. Retreating the bishop is unpleasant, but probably still best. A young Egyptian GM avoided this retreat when playing against me. After 6 ... Wfb6 7.lllxd5 lllxd5 8.Wfxd5 e6 9.Wfb3 i.b4t 1 0.i.d2 lllc6 1 1 .e3 E:c8 1 2.a3 .Bxd2t

In the Malakhov game we saw 5 ...e6. Compared to this, 5 ... i.f5 is the natural move. In the Slav Defence it is always nice if you can develop the bishop and play ...e6. The drawback is that it weakens the b7-pawn, which obliges White to play Wfb3 immediately. If Black has time to play ... e6, he would be able to defend the pawn with ... Wfc7.
6.�b3 !la7
This might seem incredibly odd, but actually it is quite a common idea in the Chebanenko and one of Morozevich's ideas at the time. He won a good game against Anand in the Dortmund tournament where Anand collapsed, losing four games and winning none.

The rook is of course badly placed on a7, but Black is banking on this being a temporary inconvenience. If he gets time to play ...e6 and ... tt:lbd7, he would be able to develop in a carefree way. Later on White would not be able to prevent the rook from coming back into the game, as we can see from the Anand game. Clearly it is a provocation and it forces White to play very energetically, to go forward and do something. If Black were given time to finish setting up his structure, there would be nothing wrong with his position. He would have no weaknesses and be able to play ... tt:le4 or ... tllh5 with good play. It would be hard to suggest anything sensible for White to do to put pressure on Black.

This has a simple point. I want to play Wfb6, which can only be prevented with the concession 7 ... dxc4.

This was clearly still part of my opponent's preparation. I was out of book after five moves, while my opponent was still playing really fast. 1 1 .e3 This is the pawn structure I was aiming for. l 1 .Bf4 is also possible and it is tempting to put the bishop on the other side of the pawn chain, but if I get a knight on a5 and develop the kingside I will have a serious advantage. Therefore it is not so important if my bishop is developed or not; so I quickly get my other pieces out and castle to safety. Getting the knight to a5 is so important that everything else dims in comparison. Another point is of course that Black is not intending to allow me to get everything as I want it, without offering some resistance. We should consider seriously how he intends to deal with this simple plan. Once we do so, it becomes apparent that he is planning on sacrificing a piece at some point for 2-3 pawns and activity. If you know your opponent is planning to sacrifice a piece against you, it makes sense to get your pieces into the game and keep your position compact. These were my reasons and they are all reasonable. But I have to say that I cannot see anything wrong with 1 Lif4 either. Maybe it is also a good move. But I wanted to keep things under control, as whenever it gets out of control, Black will have achieved the game he wanted. 1 1. ..

If White wastes time and does nothing, Black will still be able to improve his position. Another point concerning this variation is that Black has managed to change the course of the game. I was very happy to have the b7-pawn as a target, so why should I allow my opponent to escape this path so easily? This is one of the main things I learned from Rubinstein.

One of Black's tricks is that 1 5.b4? loses to 1 5. .. exd4 1 6.exd4 tllxb6! and Black wins a pawn. 1 5.b4 would of course be the dream way for White to play, bur the tactics do not work.

1 8.f3! This is the key move. Rather than crying to prove the advantage immediately, White should improve his position as much as possible. At the same time the rook will be passive on b8 and Black will struggle to find squares for all his pieces (the concept of Space Advantage is crucial to understanding Rubinstein's games and we shall have a look at this concept in Chapter 3). 1 8.ti:Jxb7 gxb7 1 9.Bxa6 gb8 20.ti:Je2 might look attractive at first, but it is important for White to keep control. 8 �� � �·

Black probably has to provoke this concrete action. This is his one chance to give up a piece for three pawns. He should not have been given the chance, but sometimes we make mistakes.

Black has three pawns for the piece, but White has a nice structure. He will play b2-b4 at some point and clamp down the black queenside. Still, winning this endgame would take a long time. White would have to eliminate all the black pawns on the queenside and then break through slowly on the kingside. Even so, I like White's position. It might not be easy to win, but it is favourable and he can play on forever. Black's task seems pretty depressing to me.

White retains the favourable structure. White has no reason to be concerned about doubled pawns in front of the king. We should only care about the things that are truly important. Black's bishop on f8 provides him with no counterplay. White's strategic operations have been entirely successful. We now see that the dark-squared bishop has been bad all of the game and that this has been a big part of Black's problems. In this line White has of course been entirely successful in keeping his best piece, while leaving his opponent with his most impotent piece. Petrosian was known for being great at exchanging the right pieces, bur Rubinstein was not bad at this either.

I certainly did not have the feeling of playing a surprising or genius move at any time, though I do think I handled the challenges of preventing his counterplay quite well. Morozevich was one of the first to work deeply with computer programs, so maybe at some point he simply believed the evaluation of the computer, which evaluates the position as acceptable for Black even to this day. Probably his training games also went well and he felt confident enough to try it in a big tournament game. One of the myths of Morozevich has always been that he is very creative and plays with a lot of improvisation. Obviously he is very creative at the board, but we should not forget that this creativity in the opening is based on a lot of home analysis. The public have a tendency to not understand that about the conception of
58 Positional Decision Making in Chess
the most innovative ideas; they do not see how much preparation it requires between tournaments to be creative. Luckily this does not in any way diminish his achievements in this area; being creative at home is very difficult as well, as anyone who has ever cried can testify. My own playing style does not usually bring as much enthusiasm from the chess fans as chat of Morozevich, but in the struggle between dynamics and statics, sometimes someone has to cake the more conservative side. I do not personally chink this makes the games dull, though I am aware chat at times the real battle is going on under the surface, making it harder for some people to comprehend. Hopefully the more verbal explanations in this book will help unlock the thought process behind this kind of strategic game for a lot of people. In general I would like to add chat I am a strong believer in the value of a chess education built on thorough knowledge of the classics. Any attempt co emulate the engines and their 2,000,000 moves a second is doomed co fail. We need to supplement calculation with all other weapons available. And one of these is intuition, which is strongly rooted in pattern recognition. When you have "uploaded" a lot of chess patterns to your brain in your childhood, you will often have a very strong suspicion regarding what the right move is in a position, even though you have no idea why. ..

60 Positional Decision Making in Chess
A classically trained player will approach each position based on his understanding of its needs. If he has a lead in development, he will most likely try to attack the opponent's king, for example. If he has a material advantage, he will try to prevent all counterplay and perhaps steer the game towards a winning endgame. The possibilities are many. This is hopefully obvious to everyone, though not everyone thinks this way! The reason why so many trainers recommend that we study the best games of such diverse players as Capablanca, Alekhine, Tai, Petrosian and so on, is that they all excelled in playing different types of positions and it should be our goal to learn to play them all as well as possible. Rather more complex is how we approach having an advantage. Many players try to force their will on a position if they determine that they are better. At times such a concrete way of exploiting the initiative is the right strategy and at other times it is not. Chess is a game with a sizable drawing margin and we need our opponents to make mistakes if we are to win. At times this is achieved by putting concrete problems to them, at other times by asking them to find a way to navigate their way out of the situation they are in. It may not be necessary to harass them too much, and we can just focus on improving our own position slowly. Capablanca talked about the death of chess because of excessive opening theory, which was already quite a dubious statement a hundred years ago. If only I was able to get the positions he got after the opening with White back then! These days you rarely get an advantage out of the opening with White, let alone a significant one. Top professionals bring deep ideas and analysis to the game as Black and in every top event some games will end in a draw without the black player having made a single independent move in the game. Grischuk said in an interview that after the Candidates matches in Kazan 20 1 1 , most players changed their approach to the opening. After a number of numbing draws in the Queen's Gambit Declined, some matches were decided in blitz. Since then, most players just want to get a game. It seems a bit of an over interpretation, but the trend is definitely going in this direction, though I would hasten to say that things were quite different in my matches in that tournament. At times we are able to get a little something out of the opening. Often the positions are quite complicated and it is hard to determine who is better, but there are also times when our position is simply pleasant. Maybe the opponent has accepted doubled pawns, maybe an isolated pawn. It might not be significant enough for us to call it an advantage, but as long as he has to make a few good moves to prove equality, there is a chance we can set him some practical problems. We apply a little pressure, just enough to make his life a bit uncomfortable. In time this might lead to a small inaccuracy - and a few more problems to solve. More problems means more chances to make mistakes. All we have to do is to keep the pressure up - to keep squeezing. Rubinstein squeezing ... Akiba had the most wonderful technique. It is quite natural that he enjoyed slowly improving his position and squeezing the life out of his opponents. The following game made a great impression on me when I was a young boy. To this day I cannot help being impressed by the way Black managed to outplay his opponent Chapter 2 - The Squeeze 6 1 slowly and accurately. I think this game was what Nimzowitsch was thinking about when he said that Rubinstein's trademark was the long plan. In the game he gets a good pawn structure, which makes it easy to improve his position.

This game was played at a time when opening theory looked nothing like it does today. Most of the games opened l .e4 e5 or l .d4 d5. These days it is quite common for Black players to use dynamics as a way to counter the slight pressure White gets from the start. A hundred years ago people tried to equalize by solving their problems early, which is what Rubinstein manages to do in this game.

This is quite a serious mistake that soon leads to a slightly worse pawn structure, creating long-term problems for White.

This brilliantly illustrates how things have gone wrong for White. Only five moves ago he rejected making this committal decision, when he was reasonably active. But now he feels compelled to play it, when he is passive and it loses a pawn by force. This is the nature of the squeeze. When you are under pressure you will usually have to make a concession or an unpleasant decision a number of times, and it is so easy to miss the moment when you have to accept that things are going wrong. You then find yourself in a situation where everything has gone entirely wrong. .. Looking at his options must have made Janowski desperate.

Played to keep everything under control. This is something I learned from Rubinstein as well. The important thing is not that you win quickly, but that you win safely. This can mean that you spend many more moves winning a position than the computer or even someone else might, but as long as you win, this does not matter. And the way to ensure that you win is to minimize the number of difficult decisions you will have to make in the conversion. And this is exactly what Rubinstein achieves with this move. 57 ...g5! is the computer's recommendation. White cannot create real counterplay against c7, as h2 would fall and the pawns promote. But to work this out with certainty would require calculation - and calculation always contains a risk of miscalculation. On the other hand, we should also be careful not to play too artificially in order to avoid 5O.Sf3 Sgxf4 51.Sxf4 Sxf4f 52.Ne3 $5 calculation. Sometimes it only postpones the

0-1 A better pawn structure A scenario I quite enjoy is the one where I have a slightly better pawn structure and for this reason can manoeuvre around, putting pressure on my opponent all over the board, threatening to carry out a strong break here or there. Obviously I prefer my structure to be strong, flexible and vibrant, and for my opponent's structure to be riddled with weaknesses, for example isolated tripled pawns. But in the real world you have to play resourceful opponents; if you achieve anything it is already time to celebrate. In the 20 1 3 World Cup in Tromso I had a game where I got in my preparation in one game and obtained a nice advantage with a better pawn structure. Alex Huzman was walking around smiling and fell into conversation with one of the arbiters, who asked him, "Why all the happiness?" Alex explained, but found no understanding. ''A better pawn structure? If he was a rook or a queen up I could understand it, but this is surely nothing!" As the playing strength of the players increases, the advantage needed to win a game also diminishes. But I am sure that having a better pawn structure is an advantage 6 5 4 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 Chapter 2 - The Squeeze 67 at all levels! So even if you do not know exactly what to use it for, get it. In the long run it will pay off. In the following game I managed to get a pawn structure where I could apply a bit of pressure down the b-file, and where it was easier for me to organize a pawn break on the kingside than it was for my opponent. In principle this could not be called an advantage, as analysis constantly proves that Black has more than sufficient counterplay. In the end, chess is a game played with ideas and moves. Each player has his own vision and understanding of chess, and will try to impose it on his opponent. In this game it was simply easier to connect White's ideas to good moves than it was to come up with ideas for Black. Boris Gelfand - Loek van Wely Plovdiv 2003 Van Wely has been one of the strongest Dutch players for two decades. He has an active positional style and is very strong willed. He was part of the European Team Championship winning teams for the Netherlands in 200 1 and 2005, both times on Board 1 . This game was played on Board 1 in Round 3 of the 2003 edition of this tournament. There is a great story involving Van Wely from 1992, when I played in Wijk aan Zee for the first time. With one round to go I was trailing Salov by half a point, and he was Black against Van Wely (I was Black against Sax). During the game Van Wely came up to me and told me that he had been offered a draw, but wanted to help me win the tournament and had thus declined. This made me a little nervous! A short time later he was dead lost. In the end I managed to win against Sax and Loek saved the dead lost position, securing me shared first place. It is quite typical of Loek to want to help by fighting! It is in his nature. l .e4 Around that time, 2002-2003, I played 1 .e4 quite frequently, maybe in a third of my games. It can be a good idea to play both l .d4 and l .e4 for a number of reasons. 1) It gives you the chance to play different types of positions. 2) It makes it more difficult for your opponent to prepare. 3) It makes it easier to go for weak spots in your opponent's preparation. For these reasons I gave 1 .e4 a serious shot, but somehow it did not really work out, so after some time I stopped playing it. Around the same time Kramnik was playing l .e4 as well, but it did not work out for him either. We even worked a little together on a few openings. Also around this time Grischuk asked me a few questions: why do you play 1 .d4 when l .e4 is obviously stronger? And why do you play the Najdorfwhen it is obvious that Black's position should be lost? At the time he was very serious about this, especially that a refutation of the Najdorf would be found imminently. But a few years later he started playing both 1 .d4 and the Najdorf. .. I should say that I do not believe that you can refute openings, especially not those with a solid positional foundation and a long history, such as the Najdorf. These days, people are getting ever more inventive in the opening. Some openings that were considered just bad are now mainstream, like the Berlin for example. Other openings might be harder to play, like the Chigorin, the Tarrasch Defence or the Modern Benoni, but they cannot be refuted.

12.b4 immediately was also possible, but I was
not sure about 1 2. .. i.a6 as played in Torre - Timman, Moscow 1 98 1 , when White has to seriously consider if he wants to allow an exchange on c4. In the game Torre got a good position, but I do not think Timman played the best moves. All in all this approach is also playable, but I liked what I did in the game better. It is more flexible.
12. .. aS
This stops b2-b4 permanently and maybe even threatens ...a5-a4. On 1 2. .. i.a6 I was going to play 1 3.tllfd2 with the idea of b2-b4. There is no sensible way for Black to prevent this. He cannot play 1 3. ..b5 1 4.tlle3 b4, because after 1 5.axb4 cxb4 the bishop on a6 is hanging to l 6.E!:xa6.
13.a4
This was White's idea. The queenside is blocked and Black cannot play ...b5 or any other active options, and White is able to play a bit like in the King's Indian with a kingside expansion. In short, White secures a small structural advantage and prepares himself for a long game, trying to squeeze his opponent. Still, in an earlier game I managed to play pretty feebly against Radjabov and lose quickly.

Black is planning ... c5, ... :B:f8 and ... '1Wd7 in order to create counterplay on both flanks. White should probably respond actively with:
25.h4!?
Trying to create some play of his own. The position is very complex and it is likely that Black has full compensation for the pawn, but given a choice, I would prefer to have an extra pawn under these circumstances than to have to justify the compensation for it. I have to admit to a bias towards positional pawn sacrifices. I like this way of bringing the position out of balance and sharpening the fight. We will see more of this in the next volume. 21 .gbl The first tripling in the game. Later on the same pieces will triple on the g-file, making the game distinctive. It is not an everyday occurrence.

22 ... .Bd6 Van Wely decides to bring the bishop to c7, which makes a lot of sense. It is not really an effective piece, but from c7 it will both defend the b6-pawn and work against White's f2-f4 push. I suspect he was thinking that I would not be able to do much if he just waited. With so many pieces and so many possible things to do, this is a rather dangerous strategy, and in practice it proved difficult. Another interesting and logical option was to play: 22 ... tt:Jd4 23.tt:Jxd4 cxd4 24.Bd2 Bc5 Black has successfully defended the b6-pawn and can start to move his more effective pieces to the kingside. A possible variation that we looked at goes like this:

Preventing '1Wh3.
27.'1Wf3 :B:a7 28.:B:fl '1Wh3
[diagram]
Chapter 2 - The Squeeze 73 le seems chat Black has sufficient counterplay here, although I am still hopeful chat White would be able co sec him a few more challenges. One thing we looked at was:
29.g4 Wfxf3 30.:gxf3 f5!
f5 Black is perfectly fine. When White cakes on with the e-pawn {before or after an exchange of the g-pawns), Black will play ...e4 with great counterplay. Essentially I chink this is the way Black should have played.
23.Vfl Vd7
23 ... llld4 makes less sense than on the previous move, although it is playable.
24.h4
[diagram]
If I were allowed, I would love to play h4-h5 in order to create more weaknesses. 24 ... h5 Quite a natural decision, but this does limit Black's active possibilities on the kingside as well. If White managed to play h4-h5 and lllh4, Black's position could become unpleasant rather quickly. 24 ... llld4 This is still playable, though as mentioned Black had decided not to play it on previous moves. This is a common thing we see: if a player does not do something in good circumstances, it is highly unlikely he will do it in a less favourable situation, even if it is required. Also, White has been able to improve his position a little since move 22, so he would be able co create more difficulties for his opponent. Ac this point this includes a rather savvy tactical idea: 25 . .Bxd4 cxd4
[diagram]
26.c3! .Bc5
2le6i ...dxc3 27.c5! looks dangerous for Black. s by no means obvious chat Black will find his way through the labyrinth of variations here, or chat safe passage actually exists.
27.cxd4 exd4
The position has changed and it seems chat once again, the main active options belong to White, though Black is rather solid as well.
25.Vh3 i.c7
He follows his idea and I follow mine.
26.i.d2
A useful move. Black is not seriously planning ... f5, so there is no pressure needed on e5 anymore. Another point is chat White is starting to think about the g3-g4 break, so he needs control over the f4-square. 26 .. J�ds 21.@h1

Black is ready for ... llid4 and his position seems fine. White would therefore have to find a way forward other than a quick g3-g4, which might not be so easy. Still, I cannot shake the feeling that White is better somehow. If I manage to get the king out of the way, it should be possible to do something. Black had many chances to do something, but rejected them all for the strategy of waiting. From this point on the options start to be less and less attractive, making the defensive task much harder.

The game has of course developed rather slowly up to this point. It has been the sort of manoeuvring game that I was looking for from the beginning.

33.e5! Black will end up with an inferior
structure and a bad bishop on c7. White has excellent chances. At this point I missed a rather random chance to win the game quickly. It contains a nice geometric idea that I simply did not suspect was there. In fact, I was unaware that I had this chance before we started working on this book.
30.tllh2!! with the idea of '1We3 would lead to
a quick collapse of the black position on the kingside. He can probably give up a pawn and fight on, but it is clear that this was a big opportunity. But sometimes in chess these things are very surprising and all of the best players can show moments where they overlook stuff like this. Ifyou do not suspect there is a tactic, sometimes you just don't look. A recent moment that showed this was: Magnus Carlsen - Viswanathan Anand, Sochi (6) 20 1 4

[diagram]
33.:abgl?!
Getting ready for the promised tripling on the g-file. But actually this is an inaccuracy, allowing Black to get back in the game with an active possibility. At this point I believe 33.tllgl! is best. White has some pressure and will play Wi'g2 and tllh3 {or tlle2). We have analysed this a bit and Black constantly had to solve problems, which is what White's strategy is all about. 33 ... .td6?! With the pressure being released on the queenside, it is quite natural for Black to add some flexibility to the bishop, at least superficially. At this stage in the game, there is a chance that a few decisions are made too quickly, due to the limitations of the clock, though I have to say that neither player was in serious time trouble at this point. During the game I was also considering 33 ...:ag? and after the game I analysed it a little. Essentially White can continue to put Black under pressure for quite a while. But this is irrelevant when you discover Black's active possibility. With the rook having abandoned the queenside, Black could have played 33 ...bS! in order to create a passed pawn and with it some active play.
[diagram]
A likely short variation is 34.Wi'g2 Wff7
35.cxb5 cxb5 36.axb5 a4 and Black has good
counterplay. (Note that an additional idea beyond creating a passed pawn is ... i.a5 in order to fight for the f4-square for the knight.) It might even be White who has to be careful at this point! For this reason it is possible that White should not take on b5 at all, making it immediately obvious that Black should have played this. However, neither I, nor my opponent (to the best of my knowledge}, considered this option during the game. I only found it while working on this book. Chapter 2 - The Squeeze 77 It is very hard, when you have a passive position, to time the right moment to create active counterplay. This ...b5 idea reminds me of the final game in the most recent World Championship match, where Anand managed to put his opponent under some pressure before recklessly sacrificing the exchange and losing the game. Magnus Carlsen - Viswanathan Anand, Sochi ( 1 1 ) 20 1 4 From move 3 3 to 3 7 I wasted five moves, moving aimlessly around. It took some time for me to understand what I should be doing in the position: open lines on the kingside with f2-f4. So I should manoeuvre the knight to support this push and keep the rook on b I to prevent ...b6-b5. All of this is easy to see in hindsight. It took time to work it out at the board. Luckily, like Polugaevsky (see page 229) I was not afraid to admit my mistakes, except I did not know they were mistakes at the time! I believed I was just keeping things fluid before the time control!
34.Rg2 Rf7
We are back in the squeeze. Black has slightly more weaknesses and White can continue to put pressure on him. 35J�g5? I am not entirely sure why this move attracted me. Obviously the rook cannot be taken, but otherwise it has little function here. It is unlikely that White will actually be able to deliver some strong combination on h5 or e5.
35.El.b l
This would have been the right move. It is quite likely that Van Wely would have played 35 ... Bc7 and the game would have gone back on track. But we also analysed a more active option, just to be thorough. 35 ... E!.ab8 36.lllgl ! Going to h3 or e2. 36 ...b5!? This is the critical test, but here it does not look as convincing as previously.

38 ...a4 38 ...Ra2 39.El.cl ! El.xb5 40.llle2 and White is well coordinated and ready to reroute the knight to either c3 or g3, as well as to play El.gl with strong pressure on the kingside.
39.c4 a3 40.El.al El.a8 4 1 .Rf3
Obviously Black is not as well placed to prove compensation here as he has been at other times, and for that reason it is fair to say that he does not have any. .. 35 ... .ie?? Anand applied pressure at this point with
23...b5!!> when the white position in the centre
became less stable.
78 Positional Decision Making in Chess
Quite an understandable move. White is forced to retreat and Black has a (half)-free move to do something with. By now it is not hard to guess that Black had the chance to play 35 ...b5! with active counterplay. White might take the pawn and gee a rook squeezed on al or retreat the rook from g5 and accept chat Black has seriously improved his position. In either case the game has been blown wide open and a dirty mud-wrestling match is likely to cake place over the next 1 0- 1 5 moves, with an unclear outcome. 36J�g4 .ifll Van Wely is using his free move co fight for the f4-square. 36 ...Bd6 would repeat the position, but Van Wely (quite understandably) wanted to make something more out of my strange 35ch move. 37J�bl Quite a typical move for my way of approaching this type of position. Why not ask Black how he wants to defend the b6- pawn, as it does not appear entirely obvious what the answer is.
[diagram]
37 .. J:�a6? This was a poor decision. Not only does the rook look entirely stupid on a6, it is also completely out of the game. Although I still believe in White's position, there were better ways to defend the pawn. 37 ... :gbs This comes across as the most natural move, but was probably rejected by Van Wely because of a simple tactic. Bue if we look a bit deeper, we can see that instead White should carry on with his strategy and play:
38.lllgl !
le would be a bad idea co play 38 . .ixaS?! :gas
39.Bxb6? :gxa4, when Black becomes active

39.lllh3 .Bc7 40.@h l :gg7 4 1 .f4
White has managed co open up files on the kingside, making it possible to put extra pressure on the black position; most noticeably here, the f6-pawn. 37 ... Vfff c? would sideline the queen and White would continue with exactly the same moves and have some advantage. Finally, Black could consider not defending the pawn at all! If White takes it, the main effect might simply be a black invasion along the b-file. Chapter 2 - The Squeeze 79 37 ...Bh6! For the reasons mentioned, it makes more sense to answer this with:

39.tligl!?
Aimed at continuing with tli h3, <;f;>h l and f2-f4 as in the other lines. At some point the b6-pawn will actually need defending. But here the bogeyman jumps out of the swamp and unleashes: 39 ...b5! Yet again.
40.cxb5 Ra2
I think this gives Black decent counterplay and makes the game rather unclear and complicated. So White would have to accept the pawn on b6 after all, giving Black a lot of active play. It is possible that White is still better somehow, but from a practical perspective, this would be a fantastic development for Black and something he should have gone for - and would have gone for - had he realized it was a real possibility. Instead, with his misplaced rook on a6, Black is unable to do anything active while White regroups on the kingside, preparing to play f2-f4 with all of those threats we have talked about previously.
[diagram]
38.tLJgl!
White continues with his plan, getting ever nearer to the deadly f2-f4 break. Black can see it coming, but nonetheless it is not so easy to defend against it. 38 ... i.h6 This exchange does little for Black's position. I am not sure the bishop on d2 is a great attacking piece, but Black will certainly miss his bishop in the defence. It seems that Black should have kept the bishop on c7 and that without this, he is lost. But at this point he is no longer in time. 38 ...Bd6 39.tlih3 Bc7 40.�gl �aa8

Black is ready to defend against f2-f4, but White has another trick up his sleeve: 4 1 .Rf3!

1-0 It is possible to say that I outmanoeuvred my opponent in this game. But it was not just a difference in the level of play of the two players on the day, White also had a slight advantage out of the opening. Maybe not in the way we normally use the word advantage, as here I am talking about the advantage of having a very clear idea of what I was trying to achieve, while Black had to find ways to counter White's manoeuvring and constantly read my mind to avoid landing in trouble. In the end this proved too taxing. An important psychological point that should be mentioned is that it is quite a lot harder to play inferior positions where you are only fighting for two results, compared to positions where you are worse, but can also realistically imagine a way you can win the game. I should add that this was the first time Israel won team medals in an international event. Russia won the tournament, while we took silver and Georgia bronze. Our team line-up was Gelfand, Smirin, Sutovsky, Avrukh and Roiz.
82 Positional Decision Making in Chess
It works against the best There have been a few grandmasters who have been accused of only playing on their technique. Drawing lots and lots of games and only winning if they get an advantage in the opening or if the opponent plays poorly in a technical position. I want to stress that this is not an approach I am advocating - and I seriously doubt that these descriptions are truly representative of what these guys are trying to do. But if you manage to get a nice position, the squeeze strategy can be unusually effective. It is simply easier to play positions where you are applying pressure than to play positions where everything you do will lead to an inferior position. In such situations it is quite possible to make a mistake, even if you are the greatest chess player there ever was ... Boris Gelfand - Garry Kasparov Linares 1994 Garry Kasparov is probably the greatest chess player ever, especially through his impact on the game itself. His deep opening preparation expanded our general understanding of the game, as well as moving theory forward with concrete ideas. When I was growing up, I learned a lot from him. I shared his attitude to chess when I was younger; I played aggressively in the opening and tried to find new ideas all the time. So I believe that his attitude greatly impacted on me. I still play in this ambitious style, although Magnus Carlsen has proven that there will be plenty of chances to outplay the opponent later on, even if you have no ambitions in the opening. The Karpov- Kasparov matches probably made a greater impact on my chess understanding than anything else. I was following the games live, analysing them deeply. When I came to play in top tournaments, the first one being in Linares 1 990, Kasparov was my first round opponent. It was a great game, maybe the best we ever played (to be found on page 73 of My Most Memorable Games), and ended in a draw. It was reassuring to know that I could play on equal terms with anyone in the world, and it gave me confidence to play well for the rest of the tournament.

We had a lot of great games that enhanced the theory of the King's Indian and also introduced new strategic concepts, which are still popular to this day. This was his main opening at the time and he played it fantastically. I played the King's Indian myself until around this point, but I stopped liking it and felt it was time to do something else. In the mid-90s I started to play it less frequently and eventually ditched it completely for the Nimzo-lndian and Semi-Slav. Then suddenly Kasparov played the Queen's Gambit Declined against me, which he played very rarely at this time. Chapter 2 - The Squeeze 83

I had not specifically prepared this opening, but I had noticed that Kasparov had had the same position with White the year before. In that game he failed to win a theoretically won (but by no means easy) ending. But I still felt that it was more natural to place the knight on e2 than on h5.

Theory has developed quite a lot in this direction. We analysed it in the post mortem after the game in the old-fashioned way: we sat at the board analysing the game with lots of people watching and strong players offering suggestions. These days some players tend to rush to their hotel room to get the computer's opinion rather than develop one of their own. I still analyse my games afterwards with people such as Kramnik, Aronian, Topalov, lvanchuk - the guys who grew up learning chess in this way! Of course I analyse with younger players after the game as well, but less frequently. But not because I am not willing! White's strategic idea here is to exchange the dark-squared bishop and then consolidate his marginal strategic advantage. It is a type of
84 Positional Decision Making in Chess
position that can occur from a multitude of openings and which can be very hard to assess. We have seen these types of positions for a hundred years, with Flohr - Capablanca being a famous early game. Salo Flohr - Jose Raul Capablanca, Moscow 1 935 � r� � .r• • 6 fa �a'iB� - -%� �� �� ��

In principle Black should be able to hold, as indeed Capablanca did, even though he had what appeared to be the worst of all worlds - a minor piece ending with a bad bishop against a powerful knight. (Later on players tried to keep a set of rooks on if this endgame was appearing in the horizon.) But defending such a passive position is not to everyone's taste. From another point of view, White's advantage is not big. It is not easy to improve his position. I remember that I once got a similar position against Morozevich. I tried for some 50 moves to make progress, but found nothing. After we had made a draw he told me that I clearly had wanted to make a draw and that this is why I had not played more ambitiously! I simply had no words. But I understood that he had analysed the position we got in that game in depth and genuinely considered it harmless. Or maybe he just wanted to pull my leg ...

i.g4? Not a great moment for Kasparov and his fans. I had wanted to play f2-f3 anyway to control the e4-square and here he forces me to do it, as well as providing me with two extra tempos. Simply stunning. When Kasparov played his first match against Karpov, he struggled to solve his problems gradually, and famously went down 5-0 along the way. But he learned how to deal with these problems during the matches and at some point he was able to hold such positions to perfection. Chapter 2 - The Squeeze 85 But after 1 987 he seemed to lose patience. And also, his opening preparation was so good that he rarely faced such positions. So he became out of practice with defending such positions and had a shift in mentality, where he truly believed that he could get great positions in every game and would not have to defend. But at times he did have to defend and he was not prepared for it. Famously he lost a drawn rook ending against Piket. I think there is no chance that he would have done so during his matches with Karpov. It was of course a rapid game, but just as important is that he was not mentally prepared to play such a position. Back to our position. I think Kasparov mainly looked at 1 6.'1Wd3 and some very concrete lines, which he calculated well and where he is okay. But this is not a position where the correct moves can be decided by calculation. The effects of the moves are long term rather than short term. This is something we often see in such positions where one side is squeezing. The opponent is looking for active counterplay, but it is really hard to find, as the pieces are permanently inferior in one way or another. Of course we always need some calculation, but here it is mainly just checking that we are not missing something, while making long term strategic decisions. 1 5. ..d4 is always possible. After 1 6.lllxe6 fxe6
17. exd4 lllxd4 the question is what we make
of this position. White is slightly better, his bishop is good, but Black is also very solid, and it will be hard to remove the knight from d4. However, it is still quite early in the game and it is a good question whether Black would be happy to defend such a passive position for the rest of the game. We should also consider what choices the opponent has to make! 1 5. ..Rd6 would be more natural, with the idea of putting the queen on e5. Black would still be looking to play ...d5-d4 at some point. A natural reply is simply 1 6.Rd2 to improve the position, but it is hard to claim that White has a sizeable advantage. And after 1 6.lllb5 Rb4 ( 1 6. .. Re5 1 7.llld3 Rb8 1 8.lllc5 is also not much, but maybe something) 1 7.llld4 lllxd4 1 8.Rxd4 Rxd4 1 9.exd4 E:c4 20.llle2 we get a technical position where White has the better bishop. It is really not a lot, but still it is a game and Black would find it more challenging to come up with good moves than White, as the advantage has a lasting character. Botvinnik won some nice endings in this structure, among them one against Petrosian. Against the best defence this would not happen, but it can happen, even against a World Championship Challenger about to dethrone the Champion!
16.f3 i.e6 17.�d2 �e7
1 7. ..d4 was of course still possible. Black's situation is worse than a few moves ago, but you have to play the position you have got. After 1 8.lllxe6 fxe6 l 9.llle4 I like White, not surprisingly. I 7 ...a6 was also possible. Again I like White after 1 8.lllce2 or 1 8.llla4. The endgames are starting to become unpleasant for Black.

86 Positional Decision Making in Chess
This is a good moment to take stock. White's plan was to exchange his opponent's good bishop and consolidate. He has entirely succeeded in this, as well as managing to put his pieces in dream positions. The question is what to do next. An important consideration here is to think of what Black wants to do. Basically, he would like to exchange all the rooks. At least, if I was Black here, this is what I would try to do: make sure I had only one weakness and then try to hold. I would probably start with ...g6, but it is also interesting to do it directly: 2 1 ...:gxcl
22.:gxcl :gcs 23.:gxcSt �xc8 24.'1Mfc2 'Rd8
25.lllh5 llled7 and Black holds. So I wanted to
do something concrete to improve on this line and prevent ...g6.
21.g4!?
A concrete idea based on sound positional foundations. First of all, White can allow himself to play in this way because his opponent is not very active and because the situation in the centre is entirely stable. There are of course long-term issues with the king's safety, which we will see later in the game. But at this point in the game it is clear that the positives outweigh the negatives. The main idea behind pushing the g-pawn is to attack the d5-pawn. Nimrowitsch said that isolated d-pawns should be blockaded; Bent Larsen said they should be taken! Having satisfied Nimzowitsch, I am now aspiring to please Larsen as well... An interesting question is whether White's advantage would be enough to win the game without playing g2-g4. It is really hard to say. It is far easier to answer the question by saying that his advantage is bigger with the push.
21...lllg6?!
It appears that a sensible way for Black to play here was 2 l ...h6 22.h4 :gxc l 23.:gxcl lllc6! when it is not so easy for White to prove a serious advantage.
[diagram]
The tactical point is that after 24.g5? comes 24 ...hxg5 25.hxg5 lllh5!! and the tables are turned. So White would have to improve his position slowly; maybe with 24.:gc3, when after 24 ... :ge8 the game would continue. Maybe White should play 25.h5!? to fix the g7-pawn for later, although it is by no means obvious that this will prove relevant. One line we looked at in our analysis that shows the possible drawbacks of advancing the pawns goes like this: 25.liig2 g6 26.lllxc6 bxc6 27.'Rd4 lllxg4!
28.fxg4 'Rxh4 and Black has taken over the
initiative, although White supposedly holds the balance with accurate play. This leads me to the suspicion that 22.h4 might be too early and that White should try to improve the position in a different way before making such a committal advance. Maybe 22.:gxc8 and 23.�f5 to fight for the f5- square. Overall we can say that Black wasted time and allowed White to consolidate his position, but that structurally Black's position might still be holdable. But the main point, which I will make in this book again and again, is Chapter 2 - The Squeeze 87 that chess is a game and what really matters is that Black will have to come up with deeper ideas and find tougher resources in order to keep his position together. With the pressure increasing, so does the chance that he will err, which is indeed what happened to Kasparov in this game. Even the greatest-ever struggles when he is squeezed!
22.�g2
I am not at all sure that this is such a natural move. If Black were to take on f4, White would still keep some advantage.
[diagram]
22 ... �eS? As is often the case when one player is squeezing the other, the advantage is nothing dramatic. Bur in practice it can be hard to deal with it. You have to come up with ways to improve your position, while anticipating all of your opponent's ideas. It is quite likely that you will miss one. Kasparov decides on transferring his knight to d6, probably in order to lessen the impact of g4-g5, and to prevent any h2-h4 ideas. However, this transfer has a significant flaw. Instead Black should have played something like 22 ... E!:fd8 or 22 ... llle5, when White continues to be a little better. 23J�xc8 This is quite natural. White will be the only player with an active rook. 23 •. . .bcs 24Jkl �d6 Kasparov continues his plan. It was probably already difficult to find a good move. White also has a big advantage after 24 ... lllc7
25.h4!?.
After 24. .. i.d7 25.%Va5 the black position is uncoordinated and difficult to defend. For example 25 ... %Ve5 26.%Vb4 b5 and Black has been forced to accept more weaknesses. White will continue to keep the pressure on, allowing Black to make more mistakes in the process.
27.We l and 27.Rc5 are possible moves. I
should add that the endings are starting to look quite favourable for White. 25 ...hxg6 26.�f4 This is what frequently happens to you when you are squeezed. Black cannot defend the d5- pawn sensibly. 26 .. J�eS!?

I am sure that Kasparov simply missed this idea.
88 Positional Decision Making in Chess
Having seen his position gradually becoming more and more unpleasant, Kasparov chooses to give up the d5-pawn and at least get some activity for his pieces. Defending the pawn with 26 ... i.e6? loses to

In the game I played more ambitiously and used the threat of exchanging queens to win another pawn.

In typical style, the engine thinks the position is "just a draw" - 0.00. The human experience is of course entirely different! If this had happened during the game, I would have thought that all three results were possible. This reminds me of a game I was following live from last year's Candidates tournament.

4I .Rc6 Several commentators indicated that this was a mistake, something no one would have been able to work out on their own. Svidler's idea behind this move is nothing short of amazing, only Black has an even more amazing resource to counter it. The engine says that White has a serious advantage if he takes on b4. Obviously Peter understood this, but cried for more. 4 1 ...e4 Black is playing only moves all the way, which is probably part of the reason why Kramnik did not fully understand his opponent's ideas in advance. He knew he would have to face them soon enough; there was no reason to waste time wondering about which one he would choose in advance.

Kramnik had not anticipated the defence available to him at this point, but found it after a long think. He did not believe in it, but could not see any refutation, so he played it, hoping for the best. There is a big difference between looking at a position with an engine and having to find your own confidence. 45 ... f5 46.gxf5 E1f6!! 8 � � -�·

As happened to me in another game against Kasparov, I blunder on move 40, throwing away the advantage. I was a little nervous at this point; not because I was playing a strong player or because I had a good position, but because I was short of time (seconds!). It always affects you a bit.

4l8.ti:)f5 Lf5 49.gxf5 !z-1/2 Although he managed to save the game, Kasparov did not come out of it looking great. And this leads us to an important point, because there is no questioning Kasparov's greatness. It was the position which was very difficult to play. In short, it was more difficult for Black to find sufficient counterplay than it was for White to maintain the pressure. One of the reasons why it is so difficult to play a position where you are squeezed is that there will come a time when you need to switch from passive to active defence. If you do it too early, you can find, like Kasparov, that there are no targets for your active counterplay and that you are just wasting your time. Or like Janowski, you can miss the moment when you need to do something in order to not be squeezed entirely. It is also very difficult to cell the difference between positions chat are only slightly worse and chose chat are much worse - both feel uncomfortable. This is why blunders happen so frequently in worse positions. This is not the only time I failed co win a winning position against Kasparov. His resourcefulness in even hopeless-looking positions was quite amazing. (In a totally crazy game - Dos Hermanas 1 996 - I won a piece and was completely winning, but fell for the last trap on move 40.) It does not mean chat the strategy was not successful - only chat chess is really difficult. A final note The squeeze is the correct strategy in some positions and in others it is not. A classically trained player like myself will be happy co go for this strategy when the position allows it and it gives the best chance of success. The same goes for a player like Topalov, who is not commonly associated with this type of position, but is no less of a classically trained player than myself The difference is chat there are borderline situations where he and I might choose co go in different directions, because of our different interpretation of chess. Bue we are both going in the direction which we feel will give us the greatest chance for success. And at times this is implementing the squeeze. The goal of this chapter has therefore been to present this strategy as one possible way to play, and something we should be happy to do when the position requires it. Chapter 3 Space Advantage Te/Aviv 2012- Returning.from the match
96 Positional Decision Making in Chess
I definitely learned about space advantages from studying Rubinstein's games, as well as other classical games. le is one of my favourite weapons and we shall meet it often in these books, in one form or another. I am not sure if I can add anything new co the concept of space advantage, but I hope I can give the reader a higher level of understanding of the strategy of playing for and with additional space, looking at it from a practical angle. What is a space advantage? Having more space optically is not the same as having a space advantage. I chink this is one of che things chat tends co confuse some people. fu; I have always understood it, a space advantage occurs when pawns are taking important squares from the opponent's pieces. I chink the easiest way co illustrate this is by showing an absurd example: No space advantage If we were co add seven pieces co this position, Black would no longer have a fortress - at lease not if White is co move. White has a space advantage
[diagram]
1 .lDxg6! fxg6 2 . .Bxg6! hxg6 3.h7 and White wins. The inability of Black co defend the weakness on h7 illustrates co a great extent what space advantage is all about. (Obviously this is an absurd example and if Black were co move, he would save the game with 1 . .. lDxh6.) Most chess games are a baccle of two able minds of similar ability with exaccly the same resources at hand, so it is of course impossible for us co find such an absurd example in grandmaster practice. But this is only because the advantage has been extended grossly. Lacer in this chapter, we will see how a top grandmaster who has played Board One for a gold-medal-winning team at the Olympiad managed co end up with Black in this position:
[diagram]
White has much more space, but because of the lack of minor pieces (not that rooks would change anything) the position is a simple fortress. Chapter 3 - Space Advantage 97 A theoretical explanation My own understanding of space advantage is to a great extent intuitive. I can recognize it when it is there and I know from the example of Rubinstein and others how to handle it. This is quite a natural state for a practical player, who only has to make good decisions, not explain to others how to replicate such decisions. For this reason we looked at chess literature for good descriptions of the concept of space advantage. I am not surprised that we did not find many excellent descriptions of it, but we did find a few, of which the champion by far was Michael Stean's classic Simple Chess, originally published in 1 978, now available in an algebraic edition. His final chapter is on space and starts with this brilliantly clear explanation: "Unlike the ideas expressed so far in this book, space is not an easily definable or recognizable concept. The visual impression you obtain by glancing at a position and estimating who seems to have the lion's share can be misleading. The following is nearer the truth. Any given Pawn structure has a certain capacity for accommodating pieces efficiently. Exceed this capacity and the pieces get in each other's way, and so reduce their mutual activity. This problem of overpopulation is easy to sense when playing a position - it 'feels' cramped. "To take an example, compare Diagrams A and B. A: White has a space advantage

"They do, of course, represent the same position, but with two pairs of minor pieces less in the second case. "In Diagram A Black is terribly congested. There is no way he is ever going to be allowed to play ...b5, while alternative methods of seeking some breathing space by (after due preparation) ...e6 or ... f5 would compromise his pawn structure considerably. White on the other hand can build up at leisure for an eventual e5, safe in the knowledge that so long as he avoids any piece exchange, his adversary will never be able to free his game. "Diagram B is quite a contrast. The size of Black's forces is here well within his position's

'capacity'. As a result there are no spatial problems at all and Black can very quickly seize the initiative by ...a6 and ...b5, or even by ... b5 as a Pawn sacrifice, e.g. l ...b5 2.cxb5 a6 3.bxa6 :gxa6 with tremendous pressure. "We see from this pair of positions that Black's structure is very good, but his capacity is small. Visually White has a spatial advantage in both cases, but in the second the eye flatters to deceive. In fact, he is grossly overextended. A vast empire requires an army of equal proportions to defend it." (Pages 1 33- 1 34) Space advantage and counterplay The difference between Stean's two positions is stunning, though we should not be blind to the fact that he removes White's best knight on c3, instead of the less well placed knight on f3, in order to make his point. Still the main difference is quite clear. With fewer pieces on the board, Black is able to prepare a pawn break and open up the position, thus making his artillery valuable. If Black is struggling with limited space, he will often have to make a sad choice between suffering passively or accepting compromises to his pawn structure in order to free himself. An extreme - and realistic - example
[diagram]
In my database there are 739 games where this position occurred. I managed to win a game against lvanchuk with the white pieces in this variation, but it is really too early to say anything definite about the position. Both sides have things to be happy about. Maybe after another 800 games we will know more ... There is an argument for White having a space advantage, but if we forget about our knowledge of opening theory, we will probably find it more surprising that there is an argument against this as well. With rooks on e8 and c8, a retreat of the queen to b8/a8 and the bishop to ffi, Black will have found good squares for all of his pieces. White will have to run the risk of overextending himself in the pursuit of an advantage. Black's strategy will be to wait and at the right moment blow the position open with ...b5 or ...d5 and in some cases ...e5. I am by no means dogmatic when it comes to space; it does not always come in the shape of an advantage, but it is one of the important strategic concepts in chess we have to take into account. In order to integrate space into our strategic thinking, we need to understand how a space advantage is exploited, so we can see when it is applicable. Mobility We have seen that when you have more space, it gives you more possibilities to manoeuvre your forces around. For example: you are able to switch your pieces between the two sides of the board faster than your opponent. This can lead to a situation where you enjoy better lines of communication and have better positions for your pieces. You might be able to attack a weakness more times than it can be defended, simply because you have more space Chapter 3 - Space Advantage 99 to line up your pieces, or because the lack of freedom in your opponent's position makes it hard for him to come to the defence of his weaknesses. Yusupov on how to use a space advantage In Chess Evolution 2 on page 234, Artur starts Chapter 2 1 with the following words: "The side whose pawns are further advanced than those of his opponent often has an advantage in space. This side then has much better lines of communication, which is an effective advantage in positions in which play can be carried out on both flanks. Space is only one element in the position, and it is often less important than, for example, an open file or pawn weaknesses. Nevertheless there are plenty of positions in which the possession of more space is an advantage. The side which has an advantage in space can position its pieces better and regroup them more easily. The side which has less space often has a problem doing that: it has too few good squares available for too many pieces. "Some guidelines for the side which has the advantage in space: 1) Avoid any unnecessary exchanges of pieces, because such exchanges provide more space for the opposing side's remaining pieces. 2) Carefully prepare to open a file, so as to penetrate with your major pieces. 3) Try to prepare a pawn advance, in order to drive the opposing pieces even further back. 4) If the situation permits, you may try to manoeuvre against two weaknesses. Better lines of communication play an important part in this. 5) It is important to think prophylactically and to prevent any attempts by your opponent to free himself." I absolutely agree with these five points, but would like to add a sixth point: 6) A space advantage can be increased by a transition into the endgame. If you have a space advantage and have taken control of the position, you could find that exchanging rooks, and especially the queens, will eliminate the opponent's remammg counterplay. A good illustration of this is Gelfand - Campora, found on page 109. hope you have found this theoretical foundation interesting. I would like to close it with the point with which I started it - to me space advantage is first and foremost something I approach intuitively. This does not mean that it does not exist, or that there is not a theoretical understanding of it. It means that for a practical player, a list of rules and well-defined concepts is not as useful as a good feeling for how to handle such positions, through experience, gathered both from using it and from seeing how other players have used it. Rubinstein and space advantage If you did not notice it at the time, you can go back and look at some of the Rubinstein games we discussed earlier in this book and see his masterly handling of space advantages. But it would be a crime to write about Rubinstein and not examine at least one of his games through the prism of space. I like the next game for many reasons. I like how Rubinstein plays the opening, especially moves 7 and 9. He then plays for a space advantage in the centre with the pawn trans formations from moves 11-15, and thereafter masterly uses it to outplay his opponent.

I think Rubinstein was first with this idea. He wants to avoid the exchange on c3 under unfavourable circumstances. Obviously Black could have exchanged earlier, but Rubinstein judged, correctly I think, that it matters more here. These days the tlJd5-jump is played in roughly half of the games. 7 ... JJ8 8.d3 h6 9.b3!?

A clever move with a modern scent. It is quite natural to play a3 and b2-b4, but with b2-b3 the bishop comes into the game faster to quickly apply pressure on the centre. At the same time Black is not offered any targets, such as a pawn on b4, for example. 9• . • d6 IO.i.b2 �xd5 It is hard to see how Black would possibly be able to allow White to keep a strong knight stationed on d5 in perpetuity.

This operation is typical of Rubinstein. After the transformation of the pawn structure, we can see that White has a space advantage, not unlike a lot of positions we see in the King's Indian today (though with the bishop on g7, which gives more chances to create counterplay}. Once again we see that whenever Rubinstein had a fixed plan, he was not very flexible and

If we imagined that some young player had played this today, we would question his chess education. A modern player would seriously consider giving up a pawn with: 1 5. .. ltJd4! 1 6. .Bxd4 exd4 1 7.'?;Vxd4 g6
[diagram]
Black has given up a pawn in return for dark-squared counterplay (potentially with opposite-coloured bishops) and will follow up with moves such as ... .Bg7, ... l:'!c8 and ... '?;Va5. I am sure that it is enough. To me it looks pretty playable for Black. I have played similar positions in the Sveshnikov many times over the last few years, for example in the World Championship match with Anand. The exchange of both sets of rooks should lead to a draw. Maybe the best thing White can hope for is an ending with rook and bishop versus rook and bishop, though I cannot see a way for White to exchange the queens. But even in this case, all Black needs to do is to keep control of the c-file and he will be OK, though he would still suffer a bit. This is often the case when we play slightly inferior positions: the wrong exchanges will make life difficult for us. There is nothing special in that direction about this position. Of course we cannot criticize Duras for not making this decision. The problem is that the dangers of allowing the opponent to have a space advantage were not fully understood at the time of this game; after all, we are to some extent talking about the pre-Rubinstein era ... Even 15 ... lDb8!? appears more natural. The knight certainly has lost time returning to its starting position, but at least it has a future on a6 or d7.
16.Yfd3
Out of the pin. I find the way Rubinstein played from this point on very instructive. First he improves all his pieces. To start with, both players have a number of pieces in poor positions. Both sides have stupid bishops, the knight on f3 has no function and it is hard to work out where the knight on e7 is headed. But White has a space advantage,
102 Positional Decision Making in Chess
allowing him to regroup his pieces in a smoother way.
16. ..
Vfd??! I don't like this move much. The main idea behind this move seems to be to exchange the light-squared bishop. These days our experience in the King's Indian is extensive and we know that we need this bishop to hold the queenside together. But again, we cannot judge Duras on modern terms. At this point we can start to see a consequence of White's space advantage: Black's position is getting rather cramped. Maybe Black should play something like: 1 6. .. i.d7 l 7.llld2 b5 This is hardly an ultimate solution, but it seems necessary. 1 8.a4 a6 The computer suggests that Black should take on a4, but this only helps White. Actually, we should forget about computers when we are looking at such closed positions. Here it seems that c4 is a key square. Now imagine that the game continues with: 19 .Ei:fcl Yfb6

[diagram]
After 40 moves m a Closed Ruy Lopez White has the advantage through extra space. But in this case it is not apparent that he can do anything with this extra space. There are no entry-points and no weaknesses within reach. Furthermore White's bishop is tied to the defence of the a5-pawn. All in all, the game should soon end in a draw (as indeed it did) . In our example Rubinstein has freer hands and can start using his extra space to organize an assault on the kingside, presumably connected with f2-f4. And although it is not going to be easy to break Black's defences, it might be possible, due to the smoother manoeuvring White's space advantage gives him.

Bue it is quite typical of Rubinstein to spend as much time as possible improving his position. This is a clear sign of his style. 1 8.lt:Bc4 is neither better nor worse than the move Rubinstein chose in the game. It is a bit more energetic, but Rubinstein did not value dynamics that highly. Realistically Black would not change his play. But we should remember Bocvinnik's idea, which is that when you have to play several moves to follow your plan, it is best to start with the moves chat keep your ideas hidden and options open, if only to confuse the opponent.

At the same time Black's weaknesses on a7 and d6 are more exposed. If Black had not done anything on the queenside (you can argue he already decided to do so on his last move - a point we will quickly gloss over), but had tried to slowly improve his position, say with 20 ... lt:Bg6, Rubinstein would presumably have played in much the same way with 2 1 .i.c l i.e7, though here there is a trick. 8 ��� ��·rx�- 7 �·�if��.ef�

22 ... �g6 Probably it was already time to put the knight on a passive place like c8. Sure it is not much fun to do so, but it is hard to see what the knight is doing on g6. White's advantage is extensive no matter what; probably the position is already lost for Black, somewhere between ± and +-. When I grew up our evaluation was formed by the system used in Chess Informant, where a slight advantage (t) meant that one side was pushing, and a large advantage (±) meant that nothing conclusive could be seen, but the opponent is in a dire situation. The players from my generation still think like this, while the younger players operate with a different system, which they learned from the computer (+0.20 for example), which is not very informative in my opinion. Or maybe I am just suffering from the afflictions of middle age. (I should probably say that the use of + 1 or +2 as descriptions is now used almost universally among grandmasters. But more or less only when they want to explain how winning the position was that they misplayed!) 23J:Ua l a6 24.�cl The bishop is rerouted to a better square.

We have arrived at the final impressive move. White is obviously doing well, but the question is how to improve the position further. The knight belongs on d2, where it can defend the b3-pawn. Rubinstein's move keeps an eye on a6 while preparing to retreat the knight.

This is the final instructive moment of the game. White is completely winning. He has more space, better pieces and not least, an extra pawn. Still Rubinstein shows his excellent technical feeling by first improving the position on the kingside, even though it was probably already winning to simply push the b-pawn. As said before, Rubinstein never rushed unnecessarily; so much so that the mantra promoted by modern books on endgame technique (Shereshevsky, Dvoretsky, Yusupov, Aagaard and Muller}, "Do not hurry" is attributed to Rubinstein.

Playing for a space advantage is one of my favourite strategies and it is a highly efficient one. Even our newly crowned World Champion had problems dealing with it. Setting the scene before the game: I had won two games in the previous five rounds, against Caruana and Morozevich and was leading the event. In the end I managed to win an additional game (Black against Nakamura) and win the tournament with 6/9, half a point ahead of Magnus, even after missing my chances in this game. The day before the game I saw my old friend Mikhail Shereshevsky, author of the brilliant book Endgame Strategy, whom I had not seen for almost a decade.

White has maintained his slight edge. He has extra space and a better bishop still. At some point soon it will be time to open the position on the kingside in order to create weaknesses in the black position. I decided that this made it a good time to exchange queens, though it is by no means obvious that White does not also have winning chances by keeping the queens on the board. It is obvious that the c-file is the best place for the queens. At the moment Black has been allowed to control it, but I do not think he should be allowed to do so uncontested for any longer. By placing my queen on the c-file, I give my opponent a choice of whether to exchange queens or give up the c-file. I play what I consider to be the best move, but at times it is not obvious which path is the right one and in such cases I do the same as everyone else: I play the move that feels right to me on the day. Give me this position on another day (with the same opponent) and I might have waited before making a decision regarding the exchange of queens.

Black has by no means been outplayed here, but he is under slight persistent pressure with no clear active options. It is difficult to defend this type of position accurately, especially for humans, and it is therefore less of a surprise that Carlsen errs.

When you have managed to squeeze your opponent into only two or three ranks, it is often the case that you want to exchange the rooks and queens, but not minor pieces. Rooks, and especially queens, will be able to do a lot of damage if they manage to sneak behind a far advanced pawn chain, while minor pieces do not gain extra potential from a big void in the same way. Also, they are far less likely to escape from their prison. This of course only matters in positions where there is at least one open file; how are the rooks otherwise going to be able to escape? Bue in most games there is an open file, as for example in this one. Boris Gelfand - Daniel Hugo Campora Cesme 2004

Campora has played this a few times. I think this system is coo passive and chat White gains a definite edge out of the opening. Exchanging 1 1 0 Positional Decision Making in Chess the good bishop does little to ease the pressure, as we shall see in the game. Such observations might sound very basic, but we should not discard old knowledge just because of its age or how easy it is to understand. We should judge it on whether or not it is useful for us today. In this case it is. If Black plays 4 ... J.xf3 White can take either way. Against lvanchuk (without ... tlJf6) I took with the e-pawn. There is no big reason for this; on a different day, when I had been in a different mood, I might have taken with the g-pawn. White is fighting for an advantage there as well, but at least he has doubled pawns.

Up to this point I had not spent any time to speak of. There were no difficult decisions to take; it was simply choices between equal options.
9.d5!
I cannot say that this was a very difficult decision either. With this move White secures a good pawn structure. The bishop on g4 will sooner or later be exchanged and we are in a King's Indian structure, where Black in principle should do whatever he can to avoid exchanging the light-squared bishop. Okay, this is of course a bit dogmatic, it should not be believed religiously. But at least Black should have a serious reason for this exchange, which I do not see here. 9 ... cxd5 Black is making this decision before he is forced to do so. It would be better to keep the flexibility. If Black played something like 9 ...a6 I would probably play 1 0.tlJel ( I O.a4 is anti-positional because of 1 0. ..a5 and Black has secured a permanent outpost on c5. And after I O.tiJd2 J.xe2 l l .Wfxe2 White does not have the c4-square at his disposal. But it could still make sense, with ideas such as b2-b4 and tlJd2-b3-a5.) 1 0. .. J.xe2 l I .Wfxe2

With the idea tlJd3 and potentially even f2-f4. I have put the knight on el/d3 against the KID many times. If the c4-square is blocked, then d3 is usually the best choice. I simply find the knight better placed on d3 than on d2 in these positions.

We can see one of the problems with exchanging the light-squared bishop in this line: 1 0. ..a6 l I .tiJd2 1 1 .tlJel transposes to the previous note. 1 1 ...

If he was successful in doing so, he would probably be more or less okay (as can be seen in the game Johansen - Torre, Kuala Lumpur 1 990; though White won there too). The problem is that White will not allow it. Black would also not manage co exchange bishops with l 1 ...lDe8, when White can cry something like 1 2.i.g4!? and Black is still somewhat uncoordinated. 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1

I am sure chat there is more than one interpretation of this position, but the way I play chess, this is quite simple. I do not wane to allow the exchange of the bishop (at least not this easily). .• Jks 13.aS I spent 1 6 minutes on this move. I needed co calculate, to decide how to rearrange the pieces, and to correctly evaluate the consequences of what will ensue. As we shall see, my long-term considerations were accurate, but I did not gee there in the best possible way. If my arm was twisted and I was forced co give an evaluation of this position with Chess Informant symbols, I believe I would say that White has a clear advantage already. I value the extra space highly and I see no compensation for White's extra space, nor for the absence of the light-squared bishop. An important point is that these are long-term features chat basically cannot be changed. ••• .tds 1 12 Positional Decision Making in Chess I 3 ...b5?! by the way does not create activity for concrete reasons, which is one of the things I had co check.

White is slightly better with the bishop being better than the knights and the d6-pawn being weak. The white knight will go to d 1 and e3, from where it can go to c4 or f5, putting further pressure on Black. For this reason I looked at the prophylactic waiting move 1 5.@h l !?, which includes the idea of playing f2-f3 without suffering from any counterplay on the a7-gl diagonal.

Black has a fair amount of compensation. In both cases ( 1 6. .. 'Rb7 and 16 ... .Bxb6) White is to be preferred, but at the same time Black has reasonable chances. I cannot be certain which of the two options I would have chosen (or if I would even have thought of 1 5.@h I !?); being a pawn up with opposite-coloured bishops where Black might be able to block with a rook on b4 and a bishop on b6, or the ending with level pawns, where White will be able to squeeze for a long time. An argument one way would be that the position where Black gives up a pawn would give him more activity and thus be easier to play. But on the other hand it is also tempting to be a pawn up!
15.f'3
Simply defending the e4-pawn. Basically it is the same story as before. Black is planning to exchange his dark-squared bishop and White has a space advantage. 1 5. .Bxb5? �xc3 would be entirely wrong. Chapter 3 - Space Advantage 1 1 5
15. ..
a6 With the e-pawn defended, the b5-pawn in turn has to be defended. Note that 1 5. .. b4 1 6.tLlb l does not improve things for Black, but only creates more weaknesses in his position.
[diagram]
16J:Ul Of course I would like to transfer the knight to b4, but at the moment it is not so easy as the a5-pawn is hanging. Of course I could try something with Wfe l and some elaborate manoeuvre, but there are also other problems to solve and it makes sense to solve the easiest one first. Therefore this preparation for doubling rooks on the c-file, as well as the transfer of the bishop to h3, where it will put pressure on Black's position. 16 ...�b7 One of the problems with having limited space is that Black finds it difficult to reorganize his pieces in a meaningful way. Campora chooses to force the exchange of the dark squared bishops, but it is time-consuming and White can make significant progress in the meantime.
17.i.fl h6 18.g3 i.c7
If Black plays 1 8. .. tLlh7 with the idea of ... .Bg5, the simplest is probably to play 1 9.h4, which does not harm White's position in any way. 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1
19.@g2
So, I decided not to put the bishop on h3 after all. This move does not make too much sense. I cannot remember what my intention was, to be honest. White is essentially doing nothing, waiting for Black to play ... J.b8 so he can reroute his knight. It is worth mentioning that I consider Black's position too difficult to hold already. The best defenders are excellent at posing problems for their opponents, but here it just seems too easy for White to continuously improve his position until Black breaks under the pressure. Basically, Black played a passive opening and violated some of the basic ideas of chess: he gave up the fight for space in the centre, he gave up his bishop for the knight. It you repeatedly give the opponent permanent advantages in this way without getting anything in return, you end up in a bad place. The next few moves are automatic. 19 ... .ibs 20.�a2 .Ba7 21 .ha7 �ha7

1 1 6 Positional Decision Making in Chess

White's advantage is not up for debate, but he still needs to find a way to break through; especially as the position is rather closed at the moment. Obviously we want to squeeze Black on both flanks, but we should not do this without having a clear plan about how we can improve our position. The next stage in this game is to exchange the rooks and queens. Having done this, Black will have no counterplay whatsoever, allowing me to play on both flanks, which is necessary to exploit the advantage. Going through Rubinstein's games you will find this theme countless times. Someone else told me that the same principle exists in military strategy. It is quite logical; if you are weaker, you want to narrow the battlefield as much as possible and have as few contact points as possible. Both in war and chess, we see this concept played out in the fortress strategy. In this position Black might be able to defend his position on one flank, but as soon as the front becomes wide, he collapses. After the exchanges White will be able to open the game without fearing that something dangerous will slip through the cracks. Also, as White cannot gain control of the c-file, it makes sense to prevent Black from getting it.

26.:Sxc7
Apparently it is anything but obvious to some other grandmasters that White should exchange all the heavy artillery in this position, but I did not spend a lot of time on this decision at all. The danger of doing this is of course that Black could be able to set up a fortress and the heavy pieces would be needed to break it. Making such a decision at the board depends a lot on what you believe about the position. I was sure that I could break any attempt and therefore went for it without much hesitation. I should add that it is of course too far into the future to consider which type of fortress Black will try to set up. This is a moment to go with your feeling. I believed that White would win this ending and there were a lot of upsides to it. And I always play according to my beliefs. At the end of the day it is not a matter of life and death; nor is it the right moment to try to find ultimate solutions.

32.b4!
There is a trade-off with this move. On one hand it is no longer possible to put the knight on b4, but on the other hand Black is denied his only good square for the knight and he will feel the squeeze of limited space all the more after the loss of it. Finally, the b5-pawn is fixed. In many positions White could consider sacrificing a piece on b5 followed by queening the a-pawn. I am not saying that I would take on b5 (unless it was very clear), but that it is an additional thing for Black to worry about. 32 ... lC!cd7 After the game I wondered if it was maybe better for Black to put the knight on a4, to avoid getting too cramped. Of course White would keep the advantage, putting the king on c2 to paralyse the knight, and then regrouping the knight to a3. The threats of a sacrifice on b5 would force the black king to the queenside and/or the knight to a7. After this White can start improving his position on the kingside and hopefully win the battle there. Working on this book I looked at how this would actually play out in practice. The following long variation is just a possible example and should not be considered as a final proof of anything. But it gives a good illustration of how White could try to make the best out of his advantage on both wings: 32 ... llla4 33.'tt> d2 'tt> d8 34.'tt> c2 llld7 35.Bh3 'tt> c7 36.lllb3 lllf6 37.llld2 lllg8 38.lllbl llle7

Another small finesse. After 33.llid3?! f5! Black gets the chance to exchange a pawn and create a bit of breathing space. His troubles are by no means behind him, but life is a bit easier for him.

This is the kind of thing chat makes me wonder if I should have played 26.'kt>f2!? before exchanging the heavy artillery, with the intention of playing i.h3 quickly thereafter. This is probably chinking a bit too deeply for a human, but to ponder about such matters retrospectively makes sense, as it helps us to improve our understanding of the game and sharpen our intuition. But after 26.'kt>f2 Black can consider putting a rook on c4 or giving a check on a7. Still, I cannot shake the idea that if Black had played ... f5, I am not absolutely sure I could win the game. I would have to show great technique, put the bishop on c8, manoeuvre the knight around and see what happened. Probably it is winning, but I do not feel the same degree of certainty. 33 ... �£6 34.�d3 �e8 35.f4 After placing all the pieces in their optimal position, White starts to squeeze. 35 ... £6 Black has to do this, as after 35. ..

1-0 1 20 Positional Decision Making in Chess White is obviously winning, taking all the vital black pawns. That it is mate in eight is a bit more surprising, but luckily this is irrelevant for us when we are making decisions. I think this game is a good illustration of how to win against someone who defends passively from the beginning. The main thing to think about is the possibilities of fortresses and of course counterplay. The masterpiece The following game would definitely be in a Best Games collection, if that is what I had wanted to write. I have played Wang Yue six times; the first time in the Grand Prix tournament in Sochi 2008. He played great in that Grand Prix cycle and was very close to qualifying for the Candidates Tournament. If he had won from a better position in the last round, he would have. He really impressed me in our first game. I was not in good shape and played the opening poorly, but then I got into a bishop ending and thought I was going to hold the game. But he found an incredible plan, putting the pawns on the same colour as the bishop, winning the game. I saw that a few years later he did the same against Khairullin in the Russian League. Probably he made a real contribution to endgame theory with this game. They will have to be analysed deeply for us to see if this is the case - which is outside the scope of this project. Wang Yue is certainly a high-level player and he has really impressed me on several occasions. Sometimes he plays brilliantly, while in other games he is happy with a draw and plays without any ambition. I don't know what this is about. But his technique is excellent. He is the first Chinese player to get to the top and into the elite tournaments. In 20 1 4 he led the Chinese team to Gold medals in the Tromso Olympiad. He did so by drawing nine games and losing against Leko. But on Board One sometimes all you have to do is survive, in order that the sharks floating around on the lower boards can do the job. Wang Yue plays the Slav/Semi-Slav in what we can safely call a pretty defensive manner. The Slav is of course the team opening for the Chinese, though they do not always seem to check up on the material available to us in the West. To be honest, they do not really work with foreigners, which means that we know very little about how they work. They have some training camps, but no one really knows what goes on in them. But in general they all have excellent technique and play the Slav, which could be a clue. Wang Yue has a lot of patience and plays defensive positions really well, which is maybe why he has good results in the Chebanenko and Schlechter systems.

grab space, but also fix the structure. Therefore I need the knight jump to prevent Black from Chapter 3 - Space Advantage 1 2 1 playing ... .Bg4 i n order to exchange the bishop for knight. If he could do this and follow up with ...e5, he would be on top. So, at this stage White has a space advantage.

This was our idea. Short term, the move simply prevents ... b4, which could be relevant in some lines. Longer term, it is a slight improvement in the pawn structure, preparing to support the long pawn chain. I could have played this earlier, of course, bur there were other moves that were more pressing; for example castling. Obviously ... b4 is not really a threat at the moment. White replies llia4 and a2-a3, using the b-pawn as a target for the creation of weaknesses. Bue it might be down the line and White is now better prepared for this. The best way to describe my idea is probably that I wanted to play .Bf3, llid3 and a3, keeping a space advantage. I had looked at this variation together with Alex Huzman and somehow we came up with this set-up. I say "we" on purpose. Certainly one of us came up with it first, but it happened in a conversation while we moved the pieces around (on the board, not the screen!), both hands on both sets of pieces. It was truly a collaboration. In a very similar position I played l l .g4?! against Bareev, leading to an early confrontation on the kingside. I got a worse position and lost the game. After this we tried to understand how to play the position, which helped me for this game. 1 1 ... J.e6 12• .ia lllbd7 13.llld3!

This is the key move. I knew my opponent would place his pieces as he did in the game. So we decided to play for a space advantage.

This is the spirit of this opening: it is really passive - Black gives White a space advantage in return for solidity.

This might be a mistake, though I was entirely convinced he was going to play it during the game (as sometimes happens) . It was only when I started to analyse the game that I realized that the alternative was playable. The big question is what White should do after: 1 6. ..h5 Chapter 3 - Space Advantage 1 23 During the game I thought that it would give me an extra target, by way of a piece sacrifice (though this is by no means the only idea). But from another point of view, maybe things are not that simple. Black can put his pieces on the queenside and be ready to meet the sacrifice on h5 with a counter-sacrifice: l 7.llie2 Bf7 l 8.llig3 e6 I 9.Bd2 E!fb8

This seems to be the critical approach. If White instead plays slowly with 20.@f2 Black will try to close the board: 20 ...

It is possible that White could achieve something by shuffling the pieces around, but still, it is not so easy to find a plan for White to advance. At the same time I do not see any point of playing like this with Black. You are simply waiting to see what White will come up with, hoping that he will not be able to create serious threats. 20 ... gxh5 2 I .Bxh5 Bxh5 22.Wfxh5 llihf6!?

White has good chances to win the game. The passed pawns are very powerful. Whether Black should take on g5 or play ...h5 might be difficult to decide. But it is quite easy to explain that the fact that Black has ended up with such a choice means that something has gone gravely wrong earlier in the game. In both cases White will find chances and the question of where these would be greater is impossible to solve at the board. 1 24 Positional Decision Making in Chess Black is hoping for a fortress, to hold the position and nothing more. By exchanging the pawns he has given White the open h-file, but on the other hand, he has rid himself of a potential weakness on h5.
17.hxgS
[diagram]
At this point we can say that the opening stage is over. The pawns on c5 and g5 work together in tandem, limiting all of Black's minor pieces. Black has no active ideas and White can slowly manoeuvre his pieces around before he does something active. The first thing to do, I decided, is to attack the f5-pawn. This is done over the next eight moves, putting the bishop on d3 and knight on g3, so that a sacrifice can be considered. In the meantime Black runs with his king to the centre, which seems like a good idea, as he would otherwise risk getting mated down the h-file. Once White has managed to threaten a sacrifice on f5, Black is forced to play ...e6, limiting his light-squared bishop even further. He played it a bit quickly in the game, but with moves such as Viic2 and tli h4, I would have been able to force him to do it anyway. For Black to play ...e6 is a big improvement to White's position. We simply take one more square away from Black. Both the bishop and the knight want to use the e6-square as a transit square and now they cannot.

.th7?! I believe this is a faulty defensive idea. His idea is to use the bishop as a plug, but in the game we shall see that this idea is very risky and probably not holdable. I am not sure if Black can hold with best play, but this sort of absolutism is also not so interesting for me. It is much more important to focus on playing good moves. The right idea here is to play 26 ... E!:e7! and wait. White will continue to look for ways to improve his position. As we will see in the game, there is almost always a way to do so. Will it be enough for a win? Again, this sort of speculation is of course interesting for people watching the games with a beer in their hand, but for the competitive player, it has 8 7 6 Chapter 3 - Space Advantage 1 25 no relevance during the game. Play your best moves and see where it leads. One of the ideas behind putting the rook on e7 is that if White puts pressure on the a5- pawn, he can play ... 1"1ea7 defending it without giving White control over the b4-square. White will probably have to consider ideas with e3-e4, sacrificing a piece in order to open up the position. One knight would come to d6 and the other knight to e5. It is quite possible that White wins all the same, but this was Black's best defensive idea. (Again we see the advantage of having forced Black to play ...e6.) White has a few plans and Black will have to anticipate them and try to defend against them all. And even then, he might not be able to hold. From White's perspective, you keep on improving your position until you get to a moment where you have to calculate which plan to go for.

From here the knight can go to both b4 and e5. My thinking is that it makes no sense to go to e5 at the moment, as the bishop on h8 can go nowhere. To allow Black to exchange it would be the equivalent of giving up a piece. 42 • . • geb7 White has improved his position a lot and no further improvements seem possible. Perhaps the king would be safer on c l , but it seems pretty safe on fI as well. For this reason it is time to switch from move-by-move improvement of the position and calculate the consequences of various lines of action. I decided to break through on the kingside with an exchange sacrifice.

This comes with the threat of lllxg6 followed by Bh5. And after 43 ... l:!g7 44.llle5 White is not only threatening lllhxg6, which seems to be just game over, there is also a sort of zugzwang that makes it impossible for Black to prevent Ba5, when White manages to improve his position once again. 43 ... .ig?

This is entirely forced. It also forces White to do something. The waiting is finally over. 44J::l xh7! Both the bishops are bad, so it can be a little surprising to learn that the bishop on h7 is the better of the two. The reason is very simple: it has a function! It defends g6. By eliminating it, White can remove the g6-pawn and start to find a way in for the pieces. 44 • . • tlixh7 45 • .!LJxg6 Here Wang Yue came up with a strong defensive try that I had missed.

Black's idea is of course that after 46.!!xh7? 'Rxg6 White's advantage is not entirely conclusive. It still makes no sense for me to exchange any black pieces. 46 ••• YHd8 The funny thing is that if Black plays 46 ... llldf8 the knight on h7 is lost.

47.�b4
I think this is an instructive moment. We can now see the advantage of having spent 6-7 moves going to and fro, forcing Black to play ...a4. At the time we might think that there is no need; we are going to decide the game on the kingside. But when you can improve your position, you should do so! It is rather simplistic to say so, but it is not about saying these easy things, it is about doing them. 47 .• J:k7

This is the next critical moment. An amusing thing is that at move 40 my computer (at the time the game was played) gave me +5.00 (now it is "only" +3.50), but at the same time it could easily have been a fortress, making 0.00 the human evaluation (though I had no fear that this actually was a fortress). It is therefore not relevant to consider this position from the aspect of computer evaluations. White is better, but he will have to do something to break through. This might reduce the computer's appreciation of the position, but winning the game is about delivering the deadly blow, not about mathematics. Again, this might be a simplistic thing to say, but I think that part of whatever success I have had in chess is because I have a decent feeling for when this sort of advice is useful and I follow it when it makes sense.

We have reached the final stage of the game. White has an undisputed advantage (material) without counterplay. What he needs is to make space for the king.

You can find these games annotated in many famous books, but I find it useful to just present them to you briefly in a visual way.

His claim was that their placement decides who is attacking and who is defending, and can decide the entire game. This is of course true. But it makes sense to dig a bit deeper. If we chink of the soul as being a metaphor for the life force itself, the difference between chemistry and biology, we are certainly on the right track.

Black's minor pieces are clearly limited by the pawn structure, with no way of entering the game without losing material. We would usually talk about such pieces as being buried alive or lifeless. And if any of the pieces were able to break out of their jail, we would say chat they have come alive. I believe this is a meaningful way of understanding Philidor's statement, though we should not forget that the beauty of a metaphor is that you can understand it in many ways and still be right. Although this imaginary posmon is clearly exaggerated (not to speak of illegal because of the lack of kings!) it is still closer to real life than most people would intuitively sense.

The second half of thinking about pawn structures is to aim for a structure that is beneficial to the activity of your pieces and detrimental to the movement of the opponent's pieces. This is important, but still the first thing to chink about must be the value of the pawns themselves! Weak pawns have a tendency to be lost! And extra pawns have a Chapter 4 - Transformation of Pawn Structures 1 37 tendency to become queens and from there follows checkmate and champagne! A subtle weakness in the pawn structure One of the areas where Rubinstein added a lot to our understanding of the game is that concerned with weaknesses. The following game is really easy to understand for a modern player, but the impact of the simplicity with which Rubinstein won it on the pre-World War chess world should not be underestimated. I don't believe that Rubinstein and Capablanca learned much from each other, but looking at Rubinstein's virtuosity in the endgame, it is at least possible to see that they were thinking in the same way at times. Erich Cohn - Akiba Rubinstein St Petersburg 1 909 I like this game a lot for its simplicity. In a more or less symmetrical position with open c- and d-files, Rubinstein wins almost without any effo rt.

We have reached an important moment in the game, and one where we can see Rubinstein's style come out in full. His position is clearly pleasant, but nothing more. There are a number of good moves he could play, none of them giving White excessive problems. Naturally he chooses the move that inflicts slight damage to the white pawn structure. Again his games are best understood backwards. At the end we can see that this decision is decisive and a part of a long plan, which this time is to win in the simplest way possible. Also, we notice that Rubinstein chooses to rely on static rather than dynamic features. His play is slow, but the effects are permanent.

La 20.gxf.3 �d6 2I..te2 There is no great reason not to put the bishop on d3, but probably Cohn was heading for the pawn ending, thinking it would offer him a draw. Obviously Rubinstein was going for it as well, but for entirely different reasons ... 21 ..Jks 22.@d2 �c4t 23. .hc4 to Cohn could have returned with the king e 1 , when really nothing dramatic has happened. Of course White has wasted time, but it is hard to see what options he has squandered in the process. In principle he is just waiting to see what Black is up to. I would probably not have given up the bishop unless it was forced. 23 .. J:�xc4 24Jkl? This loses by force, which we can be certain Rubinstein had worked out long ago.
24.f4 was the correct move, to prevent the rook
from going to h4. There is no real reason why White should lose this rook ending, though he might end up doing exactly that. At least we can be sure that his defensive skills would be tested. After all, Rubinstein is famous for his fabulous skills in rook endings. We analysed it a bit and did not find it so easy for White to defend if Black plays well.

Once again we have an almost symmetrical structure with open c- and d-files. This time White has a slight initiative despite the doubled f-pawns. What made this game memorable co me was the way White manages to increase the pressure without having serious targets and/or mistakes from his opponent. He does this by creating chem, one by one, cooking soup on che slight frailty of the e6-pawn.

Sl.e6 gst 52.Qe7 Qg7 53.i>d6 gf'8 S4.ga7t Qf6 55,gd7 1-0 It may very well be that I am the only person outside Hungary who finds this game memorable (and now hopefully a handful of readers!) . I fear that to many it might come across as a bit dry. After all, White got a slight edge from the opening, put Black under some pressure and forced him to solve some problems. Having missed the "easier" ways to solve his problems, eventually Black had to find a study-like move in the rook ending (45 ... 1':i:h3!!) in order to save the game. Presumably exhausted from four hours of intensive defence and with no one hinting that this was the moment when all energy had to be consumed on saving the game, the World Champion failed the task. I agree that this does not look as exhilarating as Kasparov's unruly demolitions of Karpov in the second half of the 1 980s; but it is also a valid way of playing and on this occasion it was enough to beat the strongest player in the world at the time. King walk to h3 (or a3) As this is a chapter on pawn structures, that is of course our main focus, but it would be nonsensical not to draw specific attention to Rubinstein's king march - probably the most famous in chess history before Short - Timman, Tilburg 1 992. It is something all the following champions knew well, as can be seen from their games, such as these two examples by the World Champions from 1 985 to 2006. Evgeny Sveshnikov - Garry Kasparov Minsk 1 979 I was following this tournament live in the playing hall. Every day I would go to watch the games and think along with the great players, at times exchanging variations with other spectators.

In a roughly equal position Kramnik activates his king and attacks the weak pawn on h2. White was not able to find a way to meet this in the game, showing the practical value of following in Rubinstein's footsteps. 30 ... @f6 3U�a7 Qg6 32.�a2 �d8 33.Qel Qh5 34.�cl Qh4 35.�b3 Qh3

Come on, off to Grandma's! The pawn structure relating to the pieces These days an average club player will talk with confidence about bad bishops, outposts for knights and so on, in the same way as a layman would talk about evolution or the expansion of the universe. But it was only in the last 1 50 years that these ideas were discovered and explained in an accessible way. A hundred years ago people would commit horrible crimes against their pieces, especially in closed positions. The following game is rather interesting in that respect. White might feel that he succeeded in giving Black doubled pawns, but all he really managed to do was to give Black control of the half-open f-line. Later on, realizing this, he exchanges his good bishop, sitting back with a rather impotent light-squared bishop. But this is not the end. Rubinstein then inexplicably allows the bishop to come back to life (maybe because of time trouble?), something White does not manage to exploit fully. The game is quite a complicated one, despite the strategic aspects of it and the closed position. Analysing it was great fun and also quite thought-provoking. In the end we have a game that works on many levels: as an exploration of pawn structures and pieces, as an analysis of defensive resources, and finally as a captivating fight!

A very interesting decision from Rubinstein, tempting his opponent to take on g6, giving him doubled pawns.

One commentator has quite understandably mentioned 1 8. .Bxf7!? as a serious option. The knights are truly scary the way they jump around on the kingside. But it is not clear that
146 Positional Decision Making in Chess
it is yet necessary to give up the dream of using the two bishops later on.

White does not have any clear targets, but with the advance of the a-pawn he aims to double rooks on the a-file and take on b6 to create counterplay. It is not much, but he needs to do something. It is also not as easy as it seems at first for Black to improve his position. Sure, he can bring a knight to f4, but it is not such a great achievement. Everything is protected.
21.. . �hS
I am not sure if Rubinstein considered 2 1 ...a5!?. It is a move with both positives and negatives. It does halt the white advance on the queenside, but it also fixes Black's pawn structure permanently. As we shall see in the game, a lot of changes to the pawn structure can and will happen on both sides of the board. Most importantly, the b6-pawn would become weakened and Black would not be able to play ... c6, which can be a serious option for him in the game.
22.a5 �g6 23.f3 �f4 24.i.fl @hs
[diagram]
Both players have to some degree executed their main plans for the early middlegame. Black has transferred a knight to f4 and will now have to find a plan for the next ten moves or so. White has a harder choice. He does not have any active plans of his own, so even though his position is objectively fine, it is a bit unpleasant. For example, if he plays 25.h4 Black will reply 25 ...gxh4 26.J.xh4 g5 27.Bg3 h5, and White can start to regret his choice already. And if he prepares an invasion on the a-file, he will be hit hard in the centre: 25.�a4? d5!+
[diagram]
Black takes over the initiative. The true dangers lie in variations such as 26.exd5 �6xd5
27.Rxe5 Rd7! 28.�aal �xh3t 29.J.xh3 �de8
and the queen is trapped. Chapter 4 - Transformation of Pawn Structures 1 47 For this reason the best move is probably the prophylactic 25.Wf f2, trying to keep everything under control. But moves like these are not that easy to find, especially when you have a lot of options. Obviously Black still has a lot of possibilities and the game would continue. It is likely that Rubinstein would have enjoyed such a turn of events as well. We could imagine that Black would transfer the knight from f6 to g6 and maybe later to h4. But this would take time and White would be able to break through on the a-file. Probably this would give him enough counterplay. In the game White went for a more direct approach, which looks poor on the surface, though it actually has some merit to it. 25 . .Bxf4?! If you were writing a manual for beginners in the 1 980s you would undoubtedly have criticized this move severely. White is giving up his good bishop, leaving him in a closed position with a bad bishop on fl against a powerful knight. Indeed it is a big concession to give up the dark squares. But luckily chess is more complicated than following basic rules. Yes, they do apply, but they are not the whole story, like gravity fails to explain all of physics. On the plus side for White, we have the closure of the kingside, where Black had serious ambitions, as well as the elimination of Black's best piece and his stronghold of the f4-square. All in all, not an equation which is easy to work out without a few variations. My first impression was that this is a terrible mistake; but now I don't think so. Chess is indeed a difficult game. 25 • • • gxf4 26.Wffl g5 This is a natural continuation. It does not make sense to question it, although other options exist. 26 ...h5? 27.g5 llld7 28.h4 would be a clear improvement for White. The bishop will be useful on h3.

28 . .Bg2? A logical-looking move. The bishop is defending the kingside and especially the king. Bue the bishop is woeful on g2 and only a miracle can bring it back to life. I was unable to find a clear way for Black to break through if White attempted to set up a fortress. A possible variation goes like this: 28 . .Bb5 Rg7 29.Wfl E:hs 30.Re2 E:h6 3 1 .E:gl E:dh8 32.c;tid2 hxg4 33.hxg4 tlld7 34.a6 tlic5
35.E:afl Rf6 36.Wc l E:h3 37.Rb2 !!8h6
38.E:g2 Wfh7 39.E:fgl
White's idea is simple: he wants to exchange two major pieces and defend f3 with whatever is left. Black is seriously lacking in entry squares for the knight and king. My feeling was one of almost complete certainty that Black should win; there are simply too many pieces. But this is not a religious question and in practice it was not possible for me to break the defence as easily as I had expected. I spent half an hour on it and I did not make serious headway. I shall leave it to analytical experts such as Karsten Muller or Mark Dvoretsky to work out a way for Black to break through. But for a practical player like me, the main point is that it is hard to Black to find a way through, making this the best defensive idea for White. 28 ... <it>g7 29.%Ye2 ghs 30.<it>fl gas 31. .. �d7 32.%Yb5 hxg4 33.hxg4 �c5 34.ghl

The fortress strategy does not work without the bishop on b5. After 31.a6 Sd7 Black will play ...c6 and infiltrate through the c-file. Chapter 4 - Transformation of Pawn Structures 1 49 Black has played well. His next step should be to create a further weakness on the queenside, giving White the horrible task of having to defend on two flanks. At this point Black could play 34 ...a6 35.'Rb4 bxa5 36.'Rxa5 l:!ab8, when White would have a lot of problems to deal with: the open b- and h-files, the knight's superiority over the bishop, and the passed a-pawn. It seems likely that Black would win in the long run. Instead Rubinstein played a shocker of a move. 34 .. J.!�h4?? It is not so hard to imagine what Rubinstein was thinking when he played this move. His intention seems to be to double on the h-file or to get a passed pawn. 35Jhh4 gxh4

Unfortunately the passed pawn is not really dangerous and White has now experienced the miracle he was hoping for. The bishop has an avenue to rejoin the game. 36 . .Bh3?!

Sure, it opens the c-file, but with the bishop on h3, the value of it to Black has decreased.

This is what we came up with and we present it with some trepidation. 37 ...a5!? This is ambitious, but White holds.

0-1 A brilliant game, despite the handful of blemishes. Changes in pawn structures in my own games In both of these games, Rubinstein's play was ahead of its time. This does not change the fact that something was missing. Earlier in this chapter I paralleled advances in chess to those of physics and cosmology, and I would like to do so again. When Einstein developed his theory of relativity, he imagined a static eternal universe. Today we know that the universe has a beginning and that it is wildly dynamic. The same thing has happened in chess. Attempts to outplay the opponents through technique alone, as was the case in some of the games of Capablanca, have been replaced by a far more dynamic approach to the game. The wild tactical counterplay with which Wolf could have saved the game reflects chess thinking in our time rather than the thinking of a hundred years ago. And just as our thinking about physics now involves Quantum Theory, which I do not pretend to know much about, except that it has revealed that our world is far more complicated and dynamic than we believed, our thinking in chess has changed radically as well. Since the time of Rubinstein we have seen a considerable development in the openings, these days including the moves g2-g4 and h2-h4 in all types of positions, as well as an almost relativistic approach to material. This does not mean that the observations of Rubinstein and the style in which he played have become redundant, but only that his style has become less mainstream. Take the example of the next game: I am facing an opponent who aims for a pawn structure that facilitates active play with his pieces, with the ultimate Chapter 4 - Transformation of Pawn Structures 1 53 goal of creating direct threats to the king. In the process my opponent may allow more of his pawns to become weak and in general take more chances than Rubinstein's opponents would. But on the other hand, I am dealing with a snakelike adversary, ready to lunge at any time with his venomous fangs. At times I envy Rubinstein his opposition, though I have to admit that he probably would have quickly adjusted to the demands of modern chess and dealt with these dynamic relativists at least as well as me. In the following game I managed to mould the pawn structure to a perfect fit for my pieces, even though my opponent was one of the best players in the world, a possible future contender for the World Championship. Of course Grischuk would have been the 20 1 2 Challenger, i f I had not defeated him in the final of the 20 1 1 Candidates match; but more about this in the next volume. Boris Gelfand - Alexander Grischuk Beijing 20 1 3 Alexander Grischuk is i n my opinion one o ft he most creative players of our time (perhaps the highest praise I can give) . If I had to determine his style, I would probably compare him to Boris Spassky. He likes to play for the initiative, yet is very objective in his assessment and only goes for it when it is justified. If necessary, he is happy to play long endgames or any other type of position. However, his defining trait, as far as I can determine, is the drive to play creatively. He frequently chooses new directions in the opening just to get a fresh position. In my games with Grischuk there have been many decisive battles. We have faced each other over thirty times. I have a modest plus score at the moment, but when we sit down to play each other it would be fair to say that all three results are equally possible. Our games have been quite important in the World Championship cycle. In the 2005 World Cup he knocked me out in the tie breaks. After we had won a classical game each, the match went to the wire and I lost in blitz. In the 2007 World Championship in Mexico his results were important too. He had a close to-winning rook endgame against Anand, but failed to win it, while he managed to win a better ending against me. If it had only been the other way around. .. The most important game we played was Game 6 of the Candidates Final in Kazan 20 1 1 . It is one of my best ever games and can be found in the next volume of this series. In the latest two cycles of the Grand Prix we have managed to ruin things for each other repeatedly, and there is still one tournament to go. Hopefully this time he will ruin things for someone else after all the nice things I have said about him! I.d4 �f6 2.c4 g6 3.�c3 J.g7 4.e4 d6 5.i.e2 O-O 6.�g5

have played this a few times recently. played it a lot when I was younger and I 1 54 Positional Decision Making in Chess decided that, because it is less deeply analysed than the most popular lines, it might lead to interesting games. Of course, Grischuk also does not shy away from complications, so both players were happy to see this position on the board. 6 •• • c!lia6 As mentioned earlier, the idea of putting the knight on a6 was developed by Glek and is now universally explored in the KID.

13.d5
This is of course also a main line of theory (if we place the pawn on h7). 1 3.Be3 Bxf3 14.Rxf3 �g4 is, by the way, a common trick in the parallel variation with the pawn on h7. Black looks fine as far as I can see, though the pawn is probably better placed on h7 in this line.

13. . . cS
This is a normal move. It was also possible to take a different direction with 1 3. ..�b4
14.Be2 a5. As always, there are several options
in the opening; it does not make sense to cover them all deeply. Grischuk committed his common mistake, using too much time in the opening. This meant that he did not have sufficient time to solve the complex problems I managed to pose him later on in the game. At this point I had a real choice. I was considering playing 1 4.h3 Bd7 1 5.Be3 a la Gligoric, which would also lead to a normal game. I think it is a matter of taste and after 1 1 minutes I decided to go for 1 4.Be2 in the same way you would choose fish over steak in a restaurant; I just felt my way.
14.i.e2
Once the centre has closed, White is facing different problems in relation to the pin. So, although this looks like a loss of time, there are a number of favourable things that would not have happened had the bishop not retreated to fI earlier. Also, an exchange of Black's "good" bishop on g4 for White's "bad" bishop would be in our favour. This also explains Black's 1 5th move.
14. .. ti)h7
[diagram]
think this is a good move, benefitting from the ...h6-difference. White's main 1 56 Positional Decision Making in Chess idea is probably to play as in the game with g2-g3 and lLih4 to exploit the weakness of the g6-pawn, so Black starts his counterplay quickly, keeping the knight close to the action on the kingside.
15.g3 i.d7 16.i.d2
My first thought during the game was to play 1 6.lLih4, but I was unsure if White is really better after 1 6. .. lLigS with ideas such as ... lllh3-f4 and ... i.f6. It is possible that deep analysis will show that White indeed has better chances here, but during the game that is of little help. You need to know how you want to play the position. So eventually I settled on 1 6.i.d2 with the idea of�d l -cl , provoking Black to play ...h5, after which it would be almost impossible to carry out the ...f5 break. After this White would be able to play a3, E:b 1 and b4, in order to advance on the queenside undisturbed. This is of course a fairytale version of the idea, but usually this is the place we start. The details can be added on subsequently. Another idea is to exchange at least a pair of knights in order to reduce the tactical possibilities. But as we shall see, it becomes clear that I am not in time to achieve my aims. 16 ... �g5

rj cz> Chapter 4 - Transformation of Pawn Structures 1 57 t9.i.g2 A very natural move, keeping a lot of flexibility. The big question here is one of move orders. It would be nice if it was possible to do everything at the same time, but sadly it is not. I was slightly afraid of the entering the following variation: 1 9.a3 f5 1 9. .. lllc? 20.b4 looks good for White. Probably White needs to take on f5 and enter a typical structure.
20.exf5 gxf5 2 l .Bg2 Wf f6
2 1 ...f4? 22.Wlc2t favours White, who will occupy the e4-square.
22.f4 e4!
22 ... :B:ae8?! 23.fxe5 would be more similar to the game and presumably in White's favour, though we should never take anything for granted in such positions. 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 a b c I do not believe that White is seriously better in this structure at all. Black is ready to play ... :B:ae8 or ...b5, activating the last few pieces. White also has some resources, of course, and a variety of ideas, but Black can always obtain a lot of counterplay. At times we need to generalize like this. This is probably the most important moment for the further course of the game, seen from Black's perspective. In a structure like this, he has two standard pawn breaks, the most obvious being ... f5. But as White has not advanced his forces on the queenside yet, Black should also seriously consider breaking on that side of the board with ...b5. In retrospect it is possible to make an evaluation of these two options with reasonable certainty, but at the board, things are much harder. It appears that Grischuk, having considered the two options carefully, chose the wrong one.
[diagram]
Furthermore, about retrospective thinking in chess: it is much easier to solve problems when you know what form they take. In this position I did not seriously consider that Black would break on the queenside and somehow, although he considered it, Grischuk still did not find it compelling enough to seriously investigate it. We are used to Black playing ... f5 in the King's Indian and this is what he did. Only on this occasion, it was not the most accurate way. On the other hand, if the ...b5 idea had been played and not worked out, the criticism would have been withering: "Black plays too slowly. He should play natural moves such as ...f5, as every schoolboy knows." Criticism of decisions in chess is cheap and does not in itself teach us anything; especially not when formulated like this. 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 1 58 Positional Decision Making in Chess
19. . .
fS?! In the press conference after the game Grischuk mentioned 1 9. .. llJc?! as a serious idea; and indeed it is. f g h The idea is very concrete, Black just wants to play ...b5. I had thought about playing
20.l:!b l b5 2 1 .b4, but it is not too hard to see
that Black can reply 2 1 ...cxb4 22.llJxb5 Bxb5
23.cxb5 llJxb5 24.l:!xb4 llJd4.
[diagram]
It seems that the bishop on g7 plays a bigger part in the game than the bishop on g2. Black is more than fine. I am not sure what I would have done if Grischuk had played like this. Would I have taken big risks with 20.f4 or some other aggressive approach, fighting for the initiative? Or would I have gone for the above line and tried to secure a draw? I do not know. All we can say with certainty is that Grischuk could have set me a real challenge with 1 9. .. llJc?!. It is always easy to find an explanation that fits the solution! This could have made me doubt 1 9.Bg2 of course, but how the game turned out also matters. The move makes sense in itself. Probably we should look earlier for improvements, for example 1 5.Bd2!. Maybe 1 5.g3 and later Bg2 is a true Rubinstein idea - which includes it being a bit slow... But really, thematically this manoeuvre should be associated with Petrosian. If I had chosen: 1 5.Bd2!
[diagram]
Black would have had the option of playing: 1 5. .. fS 1 6.h3 Bh5 With some counterplay. I did not see how I would improve my position, but maybe it actually has some prospects. 1 7.a3 This looks sensible. It is not so easy for Black to continue his counterplay. Here are a few example variations: 1 7. ..f4 1 7. ..�d? 1 8.llJh4! is nice for White. 1 7. .. l:!f7?? 1 8.exfS! is a disaster for Black, on account of 1 8. ..gxfS 1 9.llJxe5!, winning. 1 8.g4 fxg3 1 9.fxg3 I would be quite happy to play White here. So the conclusion is that this is probably the most promising way to play the position. Chapter 4 - Transformation of Pawn Structures 1 59 All in all, this game is a typical King's Indian battle. White has many strategic ideas and Black's structure is a bit problematic, but with very concrete play Black can create enough counterplay.
20.f4! Vff6
During the game I was quite afraid of 20 ... lDb4, when I am forced to play 2 1 .Wfb 1 . I was thinking that something like 2 1 ...exf4 22.i.xf4 i.d4t 23.'itih l Wff6 would be unpleasant for me.
[diagram]
But as Grischuk pointed out, I have 24.a3 lDa6 25.exf5! i.xf5 26.lDe4! and White has a real advantage. This variation looks quite simple once written down, but it is by no means easy to see everything along the way and to realize that the moves given are the best ones. Were things just slightly different, they might be poor ones! We have arrived at another critical moment for our theme. White has the choice of transforming to a number of different pawn structures. The first observation we should make is that it is usually not a good idea to release the tension when we have four pawns positioned as they are on e4, f4, e5 and f5. It tends to give the opponent extra options. But this is an exception to this observation. The only real options are to take on f5 only, or to take on e5 only. It makes no sense to take on both e5 and f5, as after I take on e5 in the game, I retain the option of taking on f5 later, as long as I prevent my opponent from playing ...f4. 21 .fxe5! This forces Black into a pawn structure where neither of his bishops can come into the game easily. 2 l .exf5 gxf5 22.a3 e4 transposes to a line we looked at earlier. Black is okay. 21 ... dxe5 2 1 ...Wfxe5 is not a serious move. After
22.exf5 Wfxf5 23.lDe4 Black is in grave trouble.
The d6-pawn is weak and White is ready for i.d2-c3.

160 Positional Decision Making in Chess
I like this move as it prevents Black from advancing his f-pawn. The computer wants to take on f5 already, but for a human such a committal decision cannot be made on such flaky grounds as those presented by a machine. 22 .. J3f7 The tactical try 22 ...f4 23.gxf4 tlib4 runs aground after 24.f5!, when White's advantage is obvious. 25 ...Rd6 26. .Bh5 :R:e?

At this point I wanted ro prevent 24 ... f4

[diagram]
White is doing well, although the game of course continues. Please note that Black still struggles to make any serious pawn advances in the centre. His flexibility only involves the right to play ...e4, which is very similar to what we got in the game. So the computer's execution of the play is maybe slightly more accurate, but also very hard to find. 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 a 24 ...Rd6?! c e g This turns out only to lose time.

It is difficult to find a serious active option for Black here, and Grischuk decided to basically do nothing. 28 ... ti'h5 Another aspect is that both players were already getting low on time. I certainly had more than he did, but what is much more important is that my position is easier to play. Black will have to find a complex plan to create counterplay, while White can improve his position with simple moves. For this reason it also does not make sense to assess the position at this point. White is still improving his position, while Black is not. It makes more sense to decide later on how much better White is. The following lines show how difficult Black's position is; though it should be said that Grischuk was pretty optimistic, thinking his position was fine. 28 ...h5 29.tlldl h4 only plays into White's hands after 30.gxh4. 28 ... tllc7 This could have been tried, involving a pawn sacrifice:

This very concrete line does not end with a clear conclusion. White could also choose to keep things fluid with 34.ti'd3!?;!;, where one idea is 34 ...e4?! 35.tllxe4! and Black is under attack. 34 ... ti'xd5t! 34 ... ti'g6 35.tllxa7 l:%c7 36.tllc6± is highly unpleasant for Black.

30 ... tlle8 does not really work this time around.

Maybe the odds are I % that a top player would find all of this! But as these are the best moves, it would be strange not to include them.
33.E:f4!
White has a definite advantage and will start to pile up on the f5-pawn. However, he has to act with vigilance. If he hesitates his advantage could easily slip. Black can seek counterplay, but this could easily backfire in sharp tactics. My guess is that I would play 33.'Wf f2 if l had this position in a game. But here Black has an amazing way to gain counterplay: 33 ...a5

31.. .h5?
This is a committal decision, though at the same time a very understandable move. Black is looking for counterplay and advancing the h-pawn is a natural way to achieve this. But in reality, there is no counterplay and the h-pawn simply becomes a target. In the game I managed to win it outright. This is not easy to foresee in time trouble. To call it impossible is maybe too much, but at least it was too difficult for one of the most gifted players of our time! The problem is of course that when you are short of time, you usually calculate concrete variations, but do not pay too much attention to the strategic aspects of the position. And changes in the pawn structure are all about long-term strategic potential. We have already encountered 3 1 ...llle8?!

At this point it is not obvious how White should continue. He has a lot of pressure, but no clear-cut way forward. What is important is that the �f4-h4 manoeuvre is less effective, as the pawn has not gone to h5 and become weak. The strongest seems to be:
34.Rd2!? Rg7 35.�f4 llJe8 36.�h4 i.xe3
37.Rxe3
White maintains some pressure. 32 . .Bc3!? I played this practical move without going too deeply into the position. I obtain fine squares on e3 and f4 for my pieces, and improve my position easily thereafter. However, it turns out that 32.llJf2! with the idea of llJ h3 was even stronger. Black will later be forced to play ...e4 all the same and the knight can emerge on f4 as well as g5.

32 ... e4 Black has no alternatives. 32 ...h4 33.gxh4 e4 34.�e3 is not an improvement for Black. White would put the rooks on g3 and f4 and the knight on e3, squeezing f5 hard. 32 ...Rd6 is not only in violation of the concept of getting the knight to d6; after 33.Re2 White is winning a pawn. 33 • .Bxg7 �xg7 34.bxc5 bxc5 35J�f4!

White has won the strategic battle. The pawns on c5, f5 and h5 are all targets, while White's pawns are all safe. At the same time White's piece are gravitating towards active squares, from where they will attack the black pawns, while Black is struggling to find good defensive positions for his pieces. Still, winning the strategic battle only matters if you deliver a good technical performance thereafter. 37 •• Jks? This move is maybe not objectively bad, but then the game was not played by two computers. After the game, Grischuk suggested 37 ...Rf6 as an improvement, forcing White to make difficult and committal decisions at a point when I was running out of time.

1-0 Keeping the tension There are times when it is important to keep the tension. This happens when all the ways you can change the pawn structure are undesirable to you, while the opponent cannot change the pawn structure to his advantage either. This might sound like a rare case, yet in my experience it is anything but. It seems quite common chat both players will try to limit the positive effects of changing the pawn structure available to the opponent. Indeed, outplaying the opponent often means that you combine your ideas in a way that forces him co allow you to change the pawn structure in your favour. It can also mean that you have managed to set the opponent plenty of practical problems and chat he gives into the pressure, only to make a change in the pawn structure that is co your advantage. The latter is what happened in the following complicated game. The possible changes in the pawn structure between moves ten and twenty were numerous, but not many of chem were
48.gg6!
The simplest. White gets a knight ending with an extra pawn. 1 68 Positional Decision Making in Chess to Black's advantage. In the end he did not manage to find the subtle move that would have kept the tension, which is in some ways quite forgivable, as I did not find it during the game either. But on the other hand, not finding it meant that he lost the game rather quickly thereafter. Boris Gelfand - Boris Avrukh Ramat Aviv 1 999 My opponent is a well-known author of chess books. His first book, Grandmaster Repertoire 1 - J.d4 Volume One became an instant classic upon its publication in 2008 and, I would dare to say, elevated chess books to a formerly unseen level. These days he is more a trainer and writer than a player. He has a very strong classical chess education and strives for dynamic play always, bur based on a solid positional basis. It is an attitude I really like and share, which is one of the reasons I have enjoyed analysing with him on many occasions. Avrukh has beaten many strong players and has been a part of the Israeli national team for many years, being a member of the silver-medal winning team of 2008, as well as the winner of individual gold medals in the 1 998 and 2006 Olympiads. Boris has worked with a lot of the top players: Caruana, Radjabov, Kramnik (before the 2006 match with Topalov) and of course with me on many occasions. This game was played in the Israeli Team Championship, which is more or less the only event in Israel where all the professional players play. Even though there are many grandmasters in Israel, there is not a great chess scene and it is very rare that there are any strong events. When I moved to Israel in 1 998 the only event that made sense to play was a rapid event in Haifa (which ended in 2000) and the Israeli League. But even this does not happen often, and it is rare that the local chess fans have a chance to see me play in Israel. There are some recent signs that things could be improving, but with the past we have had, I am only a reluctant optimist. In my first year in the Israeli League, I won against many strong GMs: Sutovsky, Milov, Avrukh, Har-Zvi, Manor, and drew with Zilberman. It was my best result in the league. I have never played as many as six games again, and never as successfully. Sometimes I made 212, but it is really not the same.
1.c4
Avrukh plays the Griinfeld a lot. This was an early morning game, as are the majoriry of games in the Israeli League, so I decided to avoid a theoretical discussion. These days the English Opening is very popular, starting with I .4Jf3 or l .c4. I assume people got fed up with the enormous amounts of theory elsewhere and just wanted to play chess.

This position is similar to a harmless variation of the Sicilian Dragon, where White Chapter 4 - Transformation of Pawn Structures 1 69 has an extra tempo. Also, in those lines it is standard to put the knight on the preferable square e7, rather than b6.
10.b4
A rare move, but in my opinion the most logical one. When I returned home after the game I was surprised to find only one game in my database with it; but it was a game of the great Leonid Stein, a player I admire a lot. He died in 1 973 at the young age of 38, in tragic circumstances. In his best games we can see how great this loss was. He was truly a fantastic player. When I came to Israel I rented my first apartment from a chess player. After I moved on, it was taken over by a young man who got in trouble with the landlord for playing guitar in all the waking hours of the day. At some point he was called to the landlord's house for a "conversation". When he arrived he saw a chess set and said, "Oh, my uncle was a chess player." "Who is your uncle?" "Leonid Stein." As you can imagine, the attitude of the landlord changed immediately. He stopped throwing epithets at him, although his appreciation for the young man's musical "talent" probably did not increase much. Alex Huzman goes to a dentist called Rubinstein. Once I prodded him, asking why he did not go to Tal's son, who is also a dentist and lives in the same town as Alex. "I am a bit afraid of his style. It is better to stay with Rubinstein." There are many famous Jewish chess players; and many of their descendants live in Israel...

1-0 What went wrong for Black in this game? Basically he could not find a way to maintain the construction with a pawn on c6 and bishop 1 78 Positional Decision Making in Chess on d5 and eventually gave in, taking on e4 and played ... c5, after which his problems took a more permanent form. With time trouble on top of this, he simply collapsed. Fighting for key squares When there is a difference in strength between the contestants, even when it is as small as in this case, it is quite common that one of the players does things he normally would not do unless forced to. To some extent this is what happened to Avrukh in the previous game; the pressure became too much and he decided to make a concession, as he could not find any alternatives. And to be fair to him, there is no guarantee that such an alternative exists when you are sitting at the board. When players of equal strength face one another, it is common that they fight for key squares, preventing each other's plans and ideas while creating ideas of their own. The outcome of the game is to be found in the depths of long complicated lines and the two players' willingness to enter lines where they are unable to determine the final outcome in advance. The following game is one of the biggest victories in my career, against one of the greatest players I have had the pleasure of competing against. Levon Aronian - Boris Gelfand Dresden (ol) 2008 This game was played at the 2008 Olympiad in Dresden, where I and the Israeli team had our greatest result in team chess ever, claiming the silver medals. I had a really good score on Board 1 and missed the gold medal by the narrowest of margins. With a rating performance of 2833, I fell short of Peter Leko's 2834 gold-winning performance! Still, it was an unbelievable result. The silver medal was much more important, and of course much more difficult to get than the gold medal I achieved with the Soviet Union. The greater importance is not because I am now an Israeli, but because the Soviet team in 1 990 was clearly superior to all the other teams in the event. Important results in 2008 included our victories over Armenia and the Netherlands. Unfortunately we lost to Ukraine, missing out on the gold medal. Levon Aronian is of course one of the greatest players of our time. However, in team events he is usually even stronger. Due not least to his spirit and leadership, the Armenian team managed to win the 2006, 2008 and 20 1 2 Olympiads, and the 20 1 1 World Team Championship, as well as achieving bronze in the 2007 European Team Championship and the 2004 Olympiad. Armenia also won bronze at the 1 992 and 2002 Olympiads, though without Aronian on the team. However, it was from 2006 when Aronian entered the elite and took over Board 1 from Akopian that the team became the most successful in the world. It would not be an exaggeration to say that Aronian is the soul of the Armenian team. I consider him to be the most creative player of our time, both over the board and in opening preparation. So far he has failed in the Candidates tournament, but I hope that Anand's and my results in the Candidates in recent years will inspire him to keep on trying. He has so many qualities that I would not be surprised if he manages to become World Champion one day. I really feel that as long as one wants to work on chess and has the will to progress, there is a possibility of doing so. These days when you read older players complain about younger players that they only know how to push the space bar and have no culture, just think of Aronian. He has a great knowledge of music, literature, arts and culture Chapter 4 - Transformation of Pawn Structures 1 79 in general. This is another reason why I would be happy if he kept on improving and reached the highest peak. What a World Champion he would be! In a recent interview in New in Chess he said chat whenever he plays me, he tries to impress me. It is friendly competition. We have warm personal relations and work on chess together occasionally. So in every game we try to bring something new. If one player comes up with a good novelty, it is great! This is one of the reasons why we have so many decisive games with each other. It is always an open game where both players want to win.

A natural choice for Aronian. With this type of pawn structure it is likely chat we will have a long complicated fight, based on deep strategic play. I also have some experience with this system with White, but nowhere near as much as Levon. 4 ... .Bb4 In another game I played 4 ... tlld4 against him.

[diagram]
My preparation was not especially deep. Before the tournament my teammace Boris Avrukh had suggested this system as a possible way co play and I looked at it a little bit. My analysis was really not chat deep, but it seemed a viable option and I went for it. Obviously the main point is chat White has doubled pawns and Black is blockading chem. 12J�bl It is not obvious chat this inclusion favours White, but it is quite logical all the same. The following game by the extravagant Michael Basman against former World Champion 5 2 1 80 Positional Decision Making in Chess Mikhail Botvinnik shows some of the strategic ideas of this system: 1 2.J.e3 J.e6 1 3.!!cl h6 1 4.h3 c6 1 5.%Vd2 %Vd7 1 6.Qh2 Qh7 1 7.l:!fe l tlig8 1 8.g4 tlie7 1 9.J.f4 !!ad8 20.c5 g5 2 1 .J.e5 f5 22.gxf5 J.xf5 23.!!e3 tlig6 24.!!cel l:!e6

An obvious pawn sacrifice, which we will investigate below.

15.h3
Aronian is not seeking an instant clarification in the centre, hoping instead co gee chances later on in the game. One of the main reasons for this move is co cake away the g4-square from the black knight; another is co improve the position with f2-f4 and g3-g4 in order co put pressure on the pieces defending the centre. 1 5.%Va4 had been played in Norri - Tella, Finland 1 995, when it is not clear whether the bishop is best placed on e6 or f5. Aronian was not attracted co winning a pawn as Black obtains good counterplay: 1 5.J.xf6 %Vxf6 1 6.cxd5 cxd5 1 6. .. J.b?!? 1 7.J.xd5 !!b8! This patient move is the right way co play.

[diagram]
It is not so clear what these doubled pawns can do. Certainly the game goes on and probably White feels a bit more comfortable. It is not as simple co prove equality as I thought during the game. So, generally speaking Black seems to be fine, but with energetic play White can still cause problems with l 5.�xf6. You really need to dig deeply in order to find these options for White, and this time Aronian did not manage co do so. The way I see it is that in order to find such resources, you have to believe that they are there. I did not believe they were and we can conclude that Aronian also did not. It is hard co blame someone for not seeing something that you did not even believe could be there yourself! (Though of course this is what many chess fans do when they look at top games with the engine running!)
15. ..
i.e6 The most natural square for the bishop.
16.:Scl
The most natural reply. Of course you have to consider 1 6.f4, but I saw an exchange sacrifice that I really liked: 1 6. ..dxc4! l 7.�xc6 �xh3 1 8.E!:e l

Here I had planned to play I 8 ... E!:xe5 1 9.dxe5 W/d4t 20.mh l l2Bg4 2 1 .Wff3 E!:d8 with adequate compensation. After 22.dxc4 l2Bf2t
23.mh2 �g4 White has to play 24.Wfg2! to
keep the balance, when Black can repeat with 24 ...�f5. Instead, after 24.Wfe3 Wfxe3 25.E!:xe3 �f5! Black would win the exchange back with slightly the better chances. Of course it is not likely that you would calculate this far during the game; we are humans after all, but you would go with your feelings, and I instinctively liked this while Aronian clearly disliked it. A closer look with the engines shows that Black has a strong option in l 8 ... E!:c8!, when after 1 9. �xe8 l2Bxe8 White has to cake back on c4 and after 20.dxc4 f6 the bishop is trapped. The way I play chess I do not have co see everything in advance; I rely a lot on my feeling and on being able to see things in more detail when I am a bit closer. Everyone has their own preference regarding how to balance intuition and calculation and will find the way that suits them best. We all think in both ways, so please remember that we are talking about tendencies and not absolutes when we talk about logical and intuitive players.
16. . Jk8
After I had played this move I was a bit unhappy with it. 1 82 Positional Decision Making in Chess My alternative was 1 6. .. '?Md?!?, which also makes sense. I am not afraid of the doubled pawns. Without knights I cannot see how White is going to create any real pressure against chem at all. And after 1 7.g4, I can reply 1 7. .. lllh? with even chances.
[diagram]
Now 1 8.f4?! f6 1 9.f5 fxe5 20.fxe6 Rxe6 ought to be considered, though we should remember the words of the Armenian Master Eduard Mnacakanian: Black has an extra pawn, if nothing else (see page 204) . So instead White should probably play 1 8.Qh2 or similar, with even chances. As it turns out, the move I made was not bad, but I did not like entering forced lines. I did not see a concrete problem in them, but being forced co go in one direction is a bad sign.
17.f4!?
A very sharp move, threatening f4-f5 immediately. 1 7.�e l would have resembled the 1 6. .. Wd? lines mentioned above after 1 7. .. tllh? l 8.g4 %Vd7 l 9.'it>h2, when we have a manoeuvring game with roughly even chances. This is the first critical moment of the game. Ac this point I had to calculate the lines accurately. 17• . • dxc4! If you discarded dynamics, this would be an easy decision to make. Although Black straightens out White's doubled pawns, in return he gains control of the d5-square. The devil is of course in the detail! White has a number of active options chat have to be calculated, the most challenging of them being the one Levon chose in the game. 17 ...Wd??! would be wrong. White plays: 1 8.g4! dxc4 1 9. .Bxf6 gxf6 20.dxc4 Rd6

Fighting for the d5-square. Not surprisingly, I was not allowed to occupy it. Chapter 4 - Transformation of Pawn Structures 1 83
19.d5!
This is the most concrete option and I would assume that Levon had planned it well in advance. It is also the most principled move, and Aronian has a well-earned reputation for not walking away from a fight. .. 1 9.cxb5 cxb5 seems less challenging. If Black has the time, he will (perhaps after an exchange on c l ) put his bishop on c4. One thing I had planned was to meet 20.'\Rd2 with 20 ... .Bc4!
2 I ..Bb7 llld5!.
[diagram]
Black will have great compensation for the exchange on the light squares. Obviously I did not believe that I would be allowed to play this, but you always have to know what you will do against the most threatening ideas, and this was one of the ones I checked. The computer does not think that Black is better here, but maybe it just does not understand what is going on? One thing that plays in Black's favour is that the remaining bishops are opposite-coloured, which makes it hard for White to force exchanges.

20.c5 looks thematic, but I intended

At this point I had to calculate some long variations. What I did in the game looked very scary, but when I discovered my 25th move, I knew that I would be out of trouble. 20 .. J�xcl 21.Wxcl Rb6t When I returned to the hotel after the game I saw that 2 1 ...llle4 was also possible. Play might continue: 22.@h2 '\Ra5 23.'\Rb2 f6 24 . .Bd4 E:c8 White has to find 25.E:f3! to get enough counterplay to keep the balance. The position seems rather drawish to me, though it is obvious that it is Black who is setting problems for White here. I think Aronian would have been disappointed to have to play to equalize, as my impression during the game was that he was trying to get an advantage.

Instead White needs to play 28.a5, when accurate play will keep the balance. But as Chapter 4 - Transformation of Pawn Structures 1 85 said, this is not what Levon was looking for, and it is only something we have come to understand after analysing the game with computer assistance. I have to be honest and say chat even after analysing the game, the idea seems eerily foreign to me. However, it might have been his last chance to keep the balance.

I believed chat there were several ways for White to make a draw. This was also my conclusion after checking briefly with the computer in 2008. Bue looking deeper now, it appears that things are not so simple. White has no clear way to keep the balance, even though his position might be holdable in the long term. I hope the reader will forgive me for being a bit technical here and showing our analysis in detail. I think it helps illustrate the way White has taken risks and now will have to play many good moves in order to defend. Not an easy task at all.

for White. Understanding Black's 3 1 st move in this variation is by no means easy. Why would forcing the white king forward be an advantage? Only accurate analysis and comparison will show that after 33.g5 ¥Me5 34.¥Mg4 J.e2 it is a vital point that the f5-pawn hangs with check, as otherwise White would secure sufficient counterplay with 35.¥Mh4, which now loses a pawn. I am by no means convinced that I would have found this during the game! 29 ...gc4!

We could continue, but it makes sense to end here with a conclusion. White is fighting desperately for survival.

The only hope I can think of is to somehow give up the bishop for both of the black pawns on the kingside and make a draw with the king in the queenside corner. But I do not believe that Black need allow this. So instead White should try 32.Rf4 with a worse position in which nothing direct exists. To speak of it in terms of lost or drawn makes no sense to a practical player like me. What matters is that White has a real fighting chance, while what matters from Black's perspective is that he is happy to be able to cause White continuing problems. 27 ... i.xf5 2s.Rf4 i.e6

1-0 A curious coincidence. 1 92 Positional Decision Making in Chess Exploiting a slightly better pawn structure Up to this point we have looked at some examples where the main focus has been on creating a better pawn structure. What I have not talked a lot about is how to make something out of this advantage. Often the advantages are indirect. The play goes on, but the opponent has been burdened with an extra responsibility, like a boxer that has suddenly had his foot chained to one corner of the ring. Obviously the dream is to pin his other foot down with another weakness, making any move he makes critical. The principle of two weaknesses springs from this scenario, and has been one of the basic aspects of converting an advantage that young players have been taught since the days of Nimzowitsch and of course Rubinstein. A top grandmaster, not to mention a World Champion, will fight desperately against being pinned down with two weaknesses in a technical position, which is an important point to remember when you go over the last game of this chapter. Boris Gelfand -Viswanathan Anand Moscow (7) 20 1 2 This is quite a n important game i n my career. So far it is the only game I have won in a World Championship match and as such it marks probably the biggest highlight of my career so far. It was played just after the halfway mark and gave me a temporary lead in the match. Viswanathan Anand is one of the greatest players in chess history. He has won the World Championship in matches and in tournaments, both all-play-all and knockout. It is really not my place to present a description of his career, but I do want to say this: although he has had occasional poor results since turning 40, it is clear that he has been the victim of a lot of unfair criticism, with journalists and others trying to put words of retirement into his mouth. This is rather pointless, as Vishy still has a lot to offer to the chess world. At some point the story even was that he would not participate in the 20 1 4 Candidates tournament in Khanty-Mansiysk, something I personally never believed. Indeed Vishy did participate and won the event convincingly, giving him a return match against Magnus Carlsen. During this game I did not really notice that the changes in the pawn structure were pervasive all the way through. The pawn structure was fixed early on in the game, and subsequent play was directed at keeping and exploiting the slight advantage my better structure gave me. After the game, however, I can see that there were actually a lot of subtleties relating to possible changes in the pawn structure.

This was Anand's main defence for the match. This trendy variation does not have a name as far as I know - though we can see some resemblance with the Chebanenko Variation, which we have met a few times in this book already. Chapter 4 - Transformation of Pawn Structures 1 93 Ac the beginning of the match I must admit chat I struggled to get anything out of the opening, making the games somewhat dull for the spectators. Bue such is the nature of the World Championship. le is not 1 2 individual games, but one game played 1 2 times. In a tournament you need to win several games more than you lose in order to take first place, while in a match chose extra wins give you nothing at all, and therefore taking risks to achieve chem make no sense. I know it is not what the majority of the fans want, but to some extent chess incorporates both low-brow and high-brow elements. Blitz, blindfold and so on have little lasting value, whereas World Championship matches live on far beyond the lives of the players playing them. And history's view changes. For example, I am sure chat few people remember the 2000 match between Kramnik and Kasparov for its lifeless draws? They were there all right, but there were also exciting moments of great artistic value. Just like my match against Vishy. In the first two games I followed the recommended path:

Black wasted a move on forcing the white bishop to the pointless d2-square, resulting in an unusual arrangement of pieces all along the cl-file. Theory suggested chat White might have some advantage here, but in practice I did not manage to make the World Champion chink seriously for even one move!

Then the queens came off and on move 25 there was nothing left to do but to agree co the inevitable draw. In Game 4 I went with the main move, but again I did not manage to even scratch the surface of Black's nerves. 1 0.Rc2 e5 1 l .cxd5 cxd5 1 2.e4 exd4 1 3.lllxd5 lllxd5 1 4.exd5 lllf6 1 5.h3 .Bd7 1 6.l:!adl l:!e8 1 7.lllxd4 l:!c8 1 8.Wb l h6 1 9.lllf5 .Bxf5 20 . .Bxf5 l:!c5

Black is clearly okay and the game ended without drama in a draw on move 34. 1 94 Positional Decision Making in Chess So in Game 6 I went for an entirely different direction, only to run into my opponent's preparation.

Later in 20 1 2, Kramnik won a long game with 6.i.d3 against my second Tomashevsky, igniting new life into that line as well. There are other options, such as 6.a3 and
6.tt:le5, which could be investigated. I am sure
we will see more developments in this opening over the next few years. As we have seen with the Berlin Wall, it can be difficult to force Jack back into the box, once he has leapt out.
6.c5
A very principled move. The moment Black plays ...a6, he has weakened the b6-square, making it reasonable for White to extend his pawn structure on the dark squares. 6 ... lLJbd7 If Black wants to take back with the queen on b6, it is slightly more accurate to play 6 ...b6 7.cxb6 Wfxb6. 8 i.ai.i.�·- ��

But I was not able to cause my opponent, Andreikin, enough problems, although his position is clearly very passive at this point. The game was eventually drawn in Tashkent 20 1 4.
[diagram]
On the free day I had another look at the various options with my seconds and we decided to go deep in our analysis of a specific plan, based on a rapid development of the queenside.
7.Yfc2!
Though this was not a novelty, it was its first occurrence at the top level. I took part in the analysis sessions in the afternoon, while my seconds continued through the night, analysing the strategic concept we developed together in depth.
7.b4 b6 had been played before, but it seems
that Black can slowly solve his problems and get a decent position, similar to some lines of the Queen's Gambit Declined with 5.i.f4. It is not obvious to me that the bishop is better placed on cl ; actually, ifWhite was allowed to do so here, probably i.cl -f4 would be a decent move!
7.i.d3 e5!? reminds of some variations of the
Chebanenko Variation with 4 ...a6 5.ltJf3 b5
6.c5 ltJbd7 7.Bd3 e5!, where Black has good
results. Also here Black should be doing well. 7 ...b6 This is by no means the only move, but it is quite logical. We had also prepared in depth for a lot of other options. I ask the reader to forgive me for not revealing my intentions against these; the author should be allowed to keep a few secrets ...

Without this, Black will be left with a weak c-pawn, but advancing it does not solve all his problems. After something like 1 0.ltJa4 Ra7
1 Ukl ltJe4 1 2. .Ba5 Black is struggling with
his greatly weakened c-file. White is leading in development on the queenside, and is not

1 96 Positional Decision Making in Chess at all behind in development on the kingside. Black cannot close the c-file with ...c4 at any point, as b2-b3 will force it open again. The only argument that remains is about the size of White's advantage, a type of argument that does not really interest me at all. 9 . .Bd2 c5

10.�kl
To be honest, I did not take a great part in the analysis starting from this point. I told my seconds that the type of position suited me and left it for them to go further. As the computer has revealed to us that almost all moves are playable, the importance of what suits you and what does not suit you has increased in my opinion. This should be taken as good news, as it makes it possible to play chess in many different ways, keeping our game spiritually alive.

This is not really better or worse than the move played in the game.

White's position is easier to play. l 1.exd4 .td6 This is probably the best move. White has a pleasant position after l l .. . .Bb7 1 2.ll'la4 as well.

This is the first big moment of the game. At the time of the match we had the best possible computer we could get; it suggested 12.Na4, Chapter 4 - Transformation of Pawn Structures 1 97 which is also what my seconds spent time analysing.
12. .Bg5!
I believe that the team was not very happy with my decision here, but by the end of the game they had already forgotten all about it. 1 2.l0a4!? l0xa4 1 3.'i.Rc6t .Bd7 1 4.1.Rxd6 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 Here there are some long lines. We assumed Anand would play: l 4 ... l0e4
14. ..
l0xb2 can be considered, but it seems unlikely chat someone would enter this line in a practical game: 1 5.'i.Ra3 l0c4 l 6 . .Bxc4 dxc4 1 7. .Ba5 when Black has an uncomfortable choice. Although his options might not all be bad, this is not a line many would choose if they felt they were still in their opponent's preparation. 1 5.'i.Ra3 l0xd2 1 6.�xd2 'i.Re7 1 7.'i.Rxe7t �xe7 The computer says that White is slightly better, but I am not sure this is really the case. Black will play .. .f6 and get onto the c-line and probably equalize. Of course there is still something to analyse at this point and our analysis was by no means exhaustive. The main point is that it is possible that White is better, but it is very concrete. If Black manages to consolidate, the game would end quickly in a draw. During the game I had a look at the position and I liked it in itself, but I did not see the necessity to force matters. So I chose to play a calm move. After the match Alex Huzman and I analysed this line further and I ended up playing a third move against Aronian the following year: 1 2. .Bd3 O-O 1 3.O-O .Bb7 1 4.l0a4
[diagram]
And it was a game ... I chink I held some advantage, but fortunes changed and eventually I had to hold on to draw on move 4 1 , Gelfand - Aronian, Paris/St Petersburg 20 1 3. One of the interesting things is that the engines we were using at the times gave almost
0.00 for this structure. Even later on, when it
is obvious that White is pressing with a serious advantage, the engines were not convinced. This is why many commentators said that 23 ...g5 was a blunder and speculated on how it was possible chat the World Champion could make such a mistake. But as we shall see later 1 98 Positional Decision Making in Chess on, chat posmon was already very difficult. Only with a sequence of only moves can Black stay in the game, while the computer is still hovering around the zero-mark. But after that pawn has been advanced, even the engines can see the desperate state of Black's position, thus alerting some lazy journalists to his problems and his "horrible mistake". We have progressed far into the game, of course, but I wanted to explain my choice and the underlying considerations in detail, as this is one of the biggest decisions you can ever make at the chess board: to go against your seconds' recommendations in a World Championship match. Eventually I chose to go with my instincts and stepped into the unknown. Of course it was a hard choice and you can debate if it is bravery or stupidity to do so. In the real world this is of course decided by the result! I can imagine that my seconds would have been in another mood if I had lost after they had stayed up all night, going to bed only at seven o'clock in the morning (for two weeks in a row). Obviously it could have been very embarrassing! It comes down to this - I feel that I have to trust my intuition; it is just too difficult to work everything out.

Here White is also better. Again the machine indicates we are close to equality, but the position could be very dangerous for Black. There are not a lot of positions left in chess where we can ignore the computer's opinion, but maybe this is one of chem. Noe that we would be able to beat the computer if we played on of course! Extremely often the computer will suggest moves that no human would consider. And when we do not feel it delivers us a clear understanding of why this move is good, I cannot see that it makes sense co follow its recommendations.

Ac this point the computer is totally correct in pointing out 1 5. ..Bf4! as the best move.

I do not think that this move looks logical, but it wins an important tempo by pushing the rook away from the c-line. Black wants to play ... lllbd7, ...a5 and lacer on ... E:c8 and cake control of the c-line. The following shows how Black can use this extra time to solve his problems. 1 6.E:ce 1 Noe by any means the only square, but this is the nature of illustrative lines: they do not pretend to cover everything. 1 6. .. lllbd7 Preparing to meet llle5 and other moves with ...W!b6 to put pressure on d4. 1 7.Bg3 Bxg3 1 8.hxg3 a5

16.i.g3
I had a reasonable think at this point - twelve minutes. It is slightly surprising, as at such a moment I would usually think for longer. Maybe I was in good form? When I do not spend too much time on a choice and make a good decision, it is a clear sign of feeling decisive at the important moments. For others it might mean superficiality, but I do not think that is my problem too often. (Admittedly, some players try to even out their time consumption and spend the same amount of time on each move. Different players have different chess philosophies, which is hardly a surprise!) Anyway, it felt like an important moment. I liked my position and there is a real choice here. Either to play as I did or to give Black doubled pawns by taking on f6. After the game the computer indicated: 1 6.Bxf6 gxf6 l 7.lt:Je2!
[diagram]
With the idea of transferring the knight to h5, which is also strong. I did not spot this idea during the game, but then I was not really looking for it. It does not look that strange and if I had looked closer in that direction, I am sure I would have found it. But as 1 6.Bg3 felt quite promising I did not see a reason to look in a different direction. Again it is impossible not to think of Rubinstein and the idea of a long plan, a red thread going through the game, exploiting a few factors to the maximum. I have a memory of thinking this thought during the game, but I am not entirely sure it was at this point. After my move it is clear that White is better. The bishop on b7 is nowhere. 16 ... �cS 17.�e2 i.xg3

18.hxg3
I also considered taking with the f-pawn, although it does not fit with the concept at all. It is a sort of knee-jerk reaction to the move order. Black could have taken on g3 immediately and then played ... E:c8. It is a sort of provocation when he chooses to do it the other way around. But at the end of the day, Black's problems are on the c-file, not the f-file. Chapter 4 - Transformation of Pawn Structures 20 1
18. . .�d6?!
A natural-looking move and not one I suspected there was anything wrong with during the game. The queen goes to a better square and frees space for the rook. But in our analysis we went backwards again and again when we failed to solve Black's problems, and ended up deciding that he erred seriously on three occasions, on moves 1 5, 1 8 and 20. l 8 ... :B:c7 l 9.:B:c2 V!fa7 was another idea that we considered seriously in our analysis and which also seemed to be a serious option during the game.
[diagram]
20.V!ieS!? with the long-term idea of g4-g5 is
interesting, but we found that Black is okay after 20 ... i.c6! 2 1 .:B:fcl :B:ac8 22.Vfif4 lt'Bc4
23.g4 V!Bb6 24.lt'id l i.b5 and all his pieces have
made it to meaningful squares. Our conclusion is that White is to be preferred after: 20.:B:fcl :B:ac8 2 1 .Vfiel !
[diagram]
A brilliant move found by Alex in a similar position (see below). White is using the queen to coordinate on the dark squares, in particular supporting the knight on c3, while the bishop and knight on c3 take care of the light squares. White has a tiny advantage, though if Vishy played his best chess then he would surely manage to neutralize it over time. But then, when Vishy plays his best chess he never loses! The trick is to make him uncomfortable enough to bring him out of his balance. I want to add an important point about ... :B:c7 and ... V!fa7. It is a rather deep idea and even though it might seem simple enough, it is not straightforward to guess that the queen is best placed on the obscure a7-square. It is only when we look longer at the position that we might see that it is aiming at the d4-pawn and making ... i.c6-b5 a future possibility. Way too often people see such moves suggested to them by computers and somehow think that they are easy moves to find. This is far from the case! What often happens is that the explanation comes after being alerted to the computer's suggestion. The difficult thing in chess is to understand the important elements of a position before you know what the computer thinks is best!

202 Positional Decision Making in Chess
White plays the most natural moves. Maybe this is a good place to point out that Black is on his way to having two bad pieces, the bishop on b7 and the knight on b6. I briefly considered playing l 9.llJe5, but after 1 9. ..gc7 20.gc2 llJfd7! I could not see what I was meant to be doing.
19. . . �bd?
Improving the position of the knight and defending the a6-pawn at the same time. 19 ...a5 looks natural as well, but after 20.gfcl it is not so easy for Black to contest the c-file. 20J:Uc1
[diagram]
20 . . . gabS?! This looks like a simple waste of time; the c-file is much more important. I believe Anand was already intending to take back on c8 with the bishop, and hoped that he would get some counterplay on the b-file - maybe even against the d4-pawn. However, it is not possible to see how this could actually happen in the real world, and we can now describe this as being simply too optimistic. But we should not be too hard on the World Champion. When all the options are unsatisfactory, it can be quite hard to choose between them. 20 ...ges is what I thought Vishy was planning. My idea was to play: 2 1 .llJa4 e5 22.dxe5 llJxe5
[diagram]
It is by no means clear that Black has improved his position. The weaknesses on the queenside still exist and the bishop on b7 is still poor. On top of this the d5-pawn is now isolated. At the same time White is getting his knight to c5 and has control over the c-file. During the game I did not worry about this possibility. You can of course always add details, and certainly White will have to make more good moves to prove anything, but his position is nice. However, Black had another idea which was stronger: 20 ... gc7 with the idea of doubling the rooks. I had not originally considered it much. I am not even sure I had realized that 2 1 .llJb5 does not work (as Black takes on c2 and c l , getting two rooks and the initiative for the queen) . As Anand played his move quickly, I did not have time to realize that it was an option until after the game.
[diagram]
Chapter 4 - Transformation of Pawn Structures 203 2 1 .Wfe l ! is Alex's nice discovery. The main idea is to play llia4 and control the dark squares (b4 and a5) while doing so. I like White's prospects. A possible way the play can continue is: 2 1 ...�ac8 22.llia4 �xc2 23.i.xc2!
[diagram]
White is ready to play b4 and llic5 with an advantage. Notice that White should avoid exchanging the second rook, which would allow Black more freedom of movement in the long run. We can see how well placed the queen is on e l , just as we can observe chat Black has failed to solve the problem of his bishop.
21.tlla4
I spent 1 6 minutes on this, even though it is the most natural move in the position. I had a full hour and wanted to be sure I was getting the most out of my position. As it turns out, there are a lot of other good moves, which is an indication of how well things have gone for White.
[diagram]
White has achieved a lot. I don't find it relevant to debate the size of the advantage. Rather what we should realize is chat Black's cask has really become difficult. White's play is straightforward and he has simple and easy goals, while Black will absolutely have to find something chat will change the course of the game, otherwise he will eventually face problems he will not be able to solve, as happened in the game. 21 •. • tlle4?! Again not the best move, but Anand is following his plan ofcreating counterplay down the b-file. When you have already decided on a path, it is rare that you will change course. The reason for this is that players who double check their own conclusions have a tendency to do this often, wasting valuable time doing so and making poorer decisions later on in the games. Such a player is unlikely to ever become World Champion. Still, 2 1 ...llie4 takes things from bad to worse. 2 1 ...�xc2 This was a better option.
[diagram]
22.�xc2!
I was anticipating the exchange of rooks and was prepared to recapture with the queen, but
22.Rxc2 is the weaker option. After 22 ...�c8
23.llic5 a5! Black is closer to equalizing,
204 Positional Decision Making in Chess
as shown in quite detailed analysis by Alex Huzman. I probably underestimated the final move, but honestly, I cannot remember exactly what I was thinking at this point. The critical position arises after: 22 ... i.c6 23.tlJc5 i.b5
[diagram]
White has several interesting options:
24.tlJe5
24.i.xb5 13xb5 25.tlJd3 also looks good for
White. 24 ... i.xd3 25.tlJcxd3 �b6 26.tlJc5 This is great for White. Probably Black is forced to play: 26 ... tlJxc5 27.dxc5 �c7
[diagram]
White has a significant advantage, which cannot easily be neutralized. An important point is that White had a better pawn structure all along, but in all the lines we have seen where Black equalized, he managed to get rid of his poor bishop or improve his pawn structure. This case lies between the two. Black has got rid of the bishop, but White's pawn structure has improved! Also, the white knight is a good deal better than its counterpart. A typical illustration of the transformation of advantages.
22.gxcSt hc8
Just when it seemed implausible, Black's bishop got worse. On 22 ... 13xc8 I was planning on playing:
23.13xc8t hc8 24.i.xe4 dxe4 25.�xe4
[diagram]
During the first Petrosian - Spassky match, Armenian radio reported that "in the opinion of International Master Eduard Mnacakanian, White has an extra pawn." Here the same is the case. Black's bishop is poor and the d5-square offers nowhere near sufficient consolation for the material deficit. The engines have a different opinion, stating that this was the lesser evil. Arguing with computers makes no sense, but of course the position is won. Anand's idea might have been to give up a pawn, but I honestly did not consider taking the pawn for even a moment. White is probably better, but it is not a positive transformation at all. Chapter 4 - Transformation of Pawn Structures 205
[diagram]
23.1'c2!
There is nothing wrong with this move, but I would like to add that from the live commentary room Leko and Karpov suggested an equally strong move: 23.Wfe l ! with the idea 23 ... .Bb7 24.Ra5!, when White has great control over the dark squares on the queenside. If Black tries to contest the c-file with 24 ... E:c8 he is faced with: 25.E:xc8t .Bxc8
[diagram]
26.Rd8t Rf8 27.Wfc7! Black is completely
tied down. Very impressive indeed. ••• g5?! Everyone criticized this move, which is indeed bad, but as we have seen it is by no means solely responsible for Black's problems. I guess the issue is partly that it was around this point that the engines started to understand the serious state of affairs that Black is facing. I can see a point to ...g5, which could be to provoke White to do something crazy, like taking on e4 in better circumstances than on the previous move. It reminds me a bit of a discussion I had with the father of one of the top young players a few years ago. I had a winning ending against someone who laid quite a cunning trap for me. I discovered the trick and found a better way to deal with the issue and quickly won the game. This father told me in an offhand remark that I was lucky that my opponent had made such a poor move, allowing me to win quickly. I tried to explain that I really did not care how long it took for me to win the game, but only about the certainty of a win. And in that respect, a well-laid trap was probably the best chance to alter the course of the game. But the old man would have none of it. You should always play the best move, no matter what, he insisted. Although I do not necessarily disagree with this statement, I think we should not allow the engines to define "the best move", but be more intelligent about it. If Black plays 23 ... .Bb7, I would play 24.llJc5 and Black's position is simply bad. The best chance for Black is 23 ... llJdf6, but after 24.llJc5 Black has to take. 24 ... llJxc5 Here it is possible to take with the queen, but it feels quite natural to play: 25.dxc5 Wfc7 26.Wfc3
[diagram]
206 Positional Decision Making in Chess
White has a big advantage. He is intending co play c5-c6 and in other ways slowly squeeze Black against the edge of the board until he flattens entirely. Obviously the computer tries to find some resources here, but we should not forget that it is the job of engines to suggest moves, even when no good options exist.
[diagram]
24.Y!Yc7
Of course I could also play 24.llJc5 with a big advantage, but I saw 26 . .Bxe4 in the game continuation and decided there was no reason not to stick to the plan. 24 ... Y!Yxc7 I saw the following line during the game: 24 ... .ib? 25 . .Bxe4 Vffxc7 26 . .ih?t! �xh7 27 .�xc7 �g7!?
[diagram]
This was the only idea I could find for Black, as returning to c8 looks particularly grim. Here White can take on d7, meeting ... .Bc6 by taking on f7, with a great ending, but I was more minded to play simple chess with 28.b4 and 29.llJc5, cementing White's hold on the position. 25J�xc7 We can now say for sure that the bishop on c8 has never got into the game. White is technically winning. 25 • • • £6 As said, I was expecting this. 25 ... llJdf6 allows 26.llJe5, when Black has no good moves.

This was my plan and is the first major change to the pawn structure since the early opening.

Chapter 5 Transformation of Advantages Maya, Avner, Avita! and Boris 2 1 0 Positional Decision Making i n Chess Breaking it down, there are several types of advantages - extra material; having the more active pieces; having a better pawn structure; two bishops against bishop and knight - and so on. The way that theoretically inclined people like to divide this up is into two types of advantage: Static advantage: An advantage that has a lasting quality. It could be a better pawn structure, extra space, extra material, bishops against knights and so on. Things that will be there ten moves later unless something drastic happens. In general, if you have an advantage like this, you are hoping it will help you to win the game - though good moves will always be necessary of course! Dynamic advantage: An advantage dependent on time. The simplest form is a lead in development. We also have an attack on the king and the initiative in general. Dynamic advantages have a tendency to be unstable. The attack may quickly disappear if, for example, the attacker is too deliberate in the execution and so on. Conversion in theory A game can be won only in a few ways. Besides the opponent overstepping the time limit, they are all versions ofeventual checkmate. Whether it is on the next move or in fifty moves does not matter. Resignation comes in the belief that mate cannot be avoided indefinitely. A draw is agreed in the belief that mate cannot be achieved. But then mate can happen in a few different ways. It can happen after a long fight, for example when the last pawn on the board is promoted, after which queen and king gang up on the opponent's king. Or it can happen in the opening or middlegame with a strike on an insufficiently guarded king. The conversion of an advantage is when we give up one type of advantage in order to gain another type of advantage. When we have a static advantage, it is common to convert it at some point, hoping to increase our advantage or to gain an advantage that can be more easily exploited. For example, we can give up an extra exchange in order to cripple the opponent's pawn structure. Or we can exploit one of the advantages of the bishop pair by choosing a profitable moment to exchange one of the bishops in order to create weaknesses in the opponent's position. Conversion from a static advantage into a dynamic advantage, or vice versa, is quite common. Giving up a pawn for an attack, or giving up the attack in order to secure an extra pawn; these can both be easily imagined. However, we rarely see the exchange of one dynamic advantage for another dynamic advantage. Most players would probably find it difficult to think of one, myself included. An important point about dynamic advantages is that we need to make something of them before they disappear. They are unstable. A lead in development will either grow or decrease; and if we do not manage to convert it into mate or a static advantage, the opponent will get his pieces out and our advantage will be gone. Conversion in practice The main principle of exploiting an advantage is to remain flexible. It is rare that we are able to win a game based on one strategic idea. It was possible in previous times - you can find beautiful games from Petrosian, Borvinnik and Rubinstein based on one idea. But these days it is nearly impossible; the level of defence has gone up. In short, our opponents have a tendency to resist! Chapter 5 - Transformation of Advantages 2 1 1 For this reason, we will at times change the nature of our advantage. An extra pawn might be sacrificed, in order to improve our pieces. Or if we have been able to put our opponent under pressure because of our better pawn structure, we might use that to create attacking opportunities. Conversely, our attack might be going well, but by changing our focus, we can win a pawn and win the game in technical style. The constellations are not infinite; I am sure it would be possible to set up a table with all the possible transitions. But it would be large and not at all useful for the practical player. For us it is essentially important to keep an open mind and look out for the options chat suggest themselves to us during the game. These transitions are very concrete and we have to follow the requirements of the position; try to solve the problems in the way they demand, not the way we would prefer. To summarize, we should not be dogmatic and stick to our plan at all costs, but should instead be ready to exploit all the possibilities we are offered. I know this sounds a bit like we should play good moves, but we will see in the games that there is a bit more meat on the bones than just this. Choosing to change the nature of the position is often quite a serious decision and we should not take it lightly. At times it will come as a natural extension of our plan and at times it will come as an option we did not expect, but that we should consider seriously. The transformations of Rubinstein In this chapter I have included four games by Rubinstein and a few games of my own, illustrating typical scenarios that someone playing in this classical sryle will encounter. As you will see, Rubinstein was really good at some types of transformation, the ones that came at the end of a plan, exemplified by moves 1 9 and 28 of the following game against one of the greatest chess thinkers of all time. Akiba Rubinstein -Aron Nimzowitsch Berlin 1 928 l.d4 ttJf6 2.c4 e6 3.ttJc3 i.b4 4.°1Wc2 d6 5.e3 c5 6.i.d3 lbc6 7.ttJge2
[diagram]
This game sees two big pioneers in this opening in battle against each other. Nimzowitsch obviously invented Black's defence, while 4.e3 is named after Rubinstein. His main idea was to play tlige2 and win the bishop pair without getting doubled pawns. 7 •.• e5 8.d5 i.xc3t We see here that we are in the early years of this system. Nimzowitsch often gave up the bishop on c3 unprovoked, while these days Black will most often look from a concession from White before giving up the bishop: either giving him a doubled pawn, or at least getting him to spend a tempo on playing a2-a3.

White has done well out of the opening. He has the two bishops, which will especially be beneficial on the dark squares where the bishop is stronger than the knight. On top of this he also has a space advantage, which he can use to put pressure on the kingside.

It is an interesting question what Rubinstein would have done if Black had played: 1 9. ..a4 I suspect that he would have played slowly, closing the position with 20.f5 in order to use his space advantage on the kingside. It seems likely that this is not enough to win the game against accurate defence, according to my analysis. In the 1 930s and 1 940s it became more and more common for players to sacrifice the exchange and the compensation that could be achieved became better and better understood. A few World Champions added additionally to this knowledge, each in their own way. Petrosian showed how the exchange sacrifice could give a long-term advantage, even in the defence, while Kasparov and later Topalov and Anand showed the dynamic potential. Here it is the dynamic factors that are in play:
20.fxe5

1-0 A fantastic game; Rubinstein at his best. But it is not always the case that we are able to carry out our plans in this way, to fully mobilize our forces and then choose which way we want to change the position. Our opponents have plans of their own, and will try to impose their will onto us. This can lead to great complications where we need to calculate and evaluate things at a deep level in order to make the best move. I do not want to give the impression that Rubinstein - nor I for that matter - always solved this kind of problem perfectly. He had a tendency to go for the more technical positions which arose from his calculation. In the following game Rubinstein brings in all his pieces before having to make a big decision on move 1 6. As we shall see, his bias towards technical positions proved quite effective, but his decision was not truly accurate. Akiba Rubinstein - Grigory Levenfish Karlsbad 1 9 1 1

Actually, you will find only a limited number of games where Rubinstein makes this kind of mistake! Bue we should not forget chat this game was played decades before Boleslavsky, Bronstein and others developed the King's Indian and added a lot of dynamic dimensions to the understanding of chess. Rubinstein's play on this move is certainly sloppy, but maybe also coloured by his love for having a space advantage. However, the most interesting moments occur at moves 25-27, where Rubinstein takes the initiative, not caring for unimportant pawns.

White has won Black's weak pawn, but is instead left with an 'Irish pawn centre', of little value in a queen endgame. At least this is what Schlechter had imagined. But Rubinstein found a fantastic way of transforming his extra pawn into a dynamic advantage with the sequence over the next three moves.

1-0 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 Chapter 5 - Transformation of Advantages 219 In the initial stages of the following game, Rubinstein's play is most impressive, yet it is the rook ending that is surely the most interesting part. In a game filled with strategic, tactical and technical challenges, these two giants of early chess history battle their way to move 76. As you would expect, not all decisions on the way were the best possible, but the high quality of the play is undeniable. Akiba Rubinstein - Alexander Alekhine Karlsbad I 9 1 I In this game Rubinstein built up a strong centre and space advantage. On the other hand, Black was very solid, so it was not so easy to make something of this advantage.

This is where the opening ends and the middlegame starts. If we look at this with modern eyes, we would not rate White's chances to be that extraordinary. If Black were to play ... l'!d7 immediately and simply improve his position slowly, he would have a solid and defendable position. Accurate play would still be needed, as White's small pluses are still valid, of course, but the game goes on.
18. ..c5?
Alekhine has played a lot of natural moves and at this point it looks natural to advance the c-pawn. However, White's centre is very solid so all this move achieves is to weaken the f3-b7 diagonal and the b5-square. 19 . .Bf3 gd7 20.a4! We can now see the problems caused by l 8 ...c5.

For tactical reasons this is the inferior choice. I have the feeling that Alekhine assessed the resulting ending as solid and defendable, but Rubinstein shows that this is not the case. 22 ... Vfic7 23.�ab l is unpleasant for Black, but it was the lesser evil.
23.axb5 cxd4 24.cxd4?
The most obvious positional move, but here Rubinstein missed a chance to improve his position greatly. I have already mentioned this once; Rubinstein was not very flexible and would rarely deviate from his strategic goals. He could have played: 24.c4! llib6 (24 ... llie7
25.�xa7) 25.c5! llic8 26.exd4

With a technically winning position. I am not sure if it was Nimzowitsch or Lasker who said about Rubinstein that he could at times be too slow, but on the other hand he would never force matters prematurely. 24 ...b6 I am pretty sure that Alekhine believed that his position was a fortress, with just one weakness and a lack of entry points in the position. But Rubinstein manages to outmanoeuvre him.

27.Bxd5!
It looks odd that White gives his strong bishop away, but as Black has to take with the pawn, his structure is weakened further and fixed in an awkward position. The transformative power of White's advantage is clear. 27 ...exdS 28.gacl White enjoys a big advantage. Black has weak pawns on a7, d5 and h7 to look after.

Chapter 5 - Transformation of Advantages 22 1 Up to this point Rubinstein has played a great game, but from here on his play is less impressive. Now, more than a hundred years later, it is of course difficult to guess why. Maybe he had not slept well; maybe it was something he ate. The possibilities are endless when once you get going. But the most accurate statement is simply that he did not handle the endgame well on this occasion. This is not a judgement on his strength, as top grandmasters today also play badly on occasion, which reminds me of Grischuk saying that he did not fully understand why I am so infatuated with Rubinstein's games. In his kind words, I am apparently a much better player than Rubinstein was. Even if you were thinking this was the case, it certainly was not the case when I bought Razuvaev's book! Or in Jacob Aagaard's words: It was only by climbing on top of Akiba's shoulders that I was able to jump into the world elite and make my own mark on modern chess history - however faint.
34.@e2?
I have no idea why Rubinstein allowed Black to exchange a set of rooks. It made more sense to wait and try to improve the position further.

advantage. He can always choose to exchange rooks when it best suits him. 34 .. J�xc6 35J�xc6 @d7

Another careless move? Rubinstein appears not only blind to his opponent's chance to create counterplay with the a-pawn, but he also weakens the e-pawn. However, as we shall see, Rubinstein had a deep prophylactic idea. An important point is that after 36.@d3 Black can force a draw with 36 ... l3c8!. The pawn ending is surprisingly a draw even after:

Usually we would assume that White would have great winning chances if he was able to exchange his e-pawn for the black b-pawn and get his king to c6.

Surely Black would end up in zugzwang? But in this case Black would actually be winning with a series of thematic breaks with ...h5, ... g5 and ...f4, allowing the h-pawn to run up the flank to promotion. White can stay back

with the king and avoid defeat, but there is no advantage to speak of. Rubinstein realized this and thus prepared to push his e-pawn with 36.f3. Black would now lose the pawn ending after: 36 ... :B:c8? 37.:B:xc8 c;t>xc8 38.e4!

Rubinstein has shuffled his rook about a bit and is now ready to go with the king to the kingside to force Black to make concessions.

White of course has the advantage in this rook endgame. He is more active and has only two weak pawns, while Black has three. The problem is chat Black's rook is fully in the game, securing him a lot of counterplay. With accurate play, Black can hold. Chapter 5 - Transformation of Advantages 225

This reminds me of a recent press conference from Scavanger where Alexander Grischuk once again displayed his entertaining wit. In a more serious moment he made the following comment on the increased use of the word blunder in the language of modern chess. "Actually, I chink this is why people chink chat players forty years ago played better than nowadays. Now the computer Chapter 5 - Transformation of Advantages 227 immediately shows the mistakes, It's red, and they think OK, they are complete patzers. But in fact in many of those situations where the computer immediately shows that it is a blunder, it would have taken a week to debate it in the press; Igor Zaitsev would find some amazing resource and so on. But now the computer just shows it in two seconds." Transformations in my own games Things are of course never easy in a practical encounter against a resourceful opponent. In the rest of this chapter I will give four examples from my own games. They all show different aspects of transforming the position in an attempt to fight for - or keep - the advantage. Things are rather subtle in places, but I hope that the deeper meaning will still shine through. In the first game we shall see how I managed to transform the advantage of the first move into a slightly preferable structure. My opponent played decently for quite a while, but the pressure of being a little worse, no matter what he did, eventually led him to make a small mistake, making it possible for me to improve the structure a bit more. Then a few things happened in the game, but eventually the better structure was decisive. Boris Gelfand - Branko Damljanovic Istanbul (ol) 2000 Branko Damljanovic is one of the strongest Serbian players of the past. I know him quite well, as we played for the same club, Agrouniverzal, once in the Serbian Cup and many times in the European Club Cup. The peak of his career came in 1 990, where he played brilliantly in the lnterzonal and would have been a Candidate had he won one of the last two rounds instead of drawing them both. In the game against Shirov in the penultimate round, he was completely winning, as is well known. But also in the last round he was winning against Ljubojevic, though we only know this today when the computers point out the amazing winning combination. In the Chess Informant annotations from the time of the game, the move that throws the win away was awarded an exclamation mark. ..

I played with him a few times and won a very nice game against him, which can be found on page 98 in My Most Memorable Games. These days he has developed his style and occasionally goes for big theoretical discussions.
228 Positional Decision Making in Chess
This game was played in the last round of the Olympiad. It was the first time I played for Israel and we had been doing very well. We had already played against all the top teams, so in the last round faced Yugoslavia, who had fewer points than us. If we had managed to win 4-0 we would have taken the bronze medal. But sadly one of our players (not mentioning any names, but his initials are B.A.) went to smoke a cigarette after the time trouble and missed a simple win, essentially because of this. After this he was still winning, but things were complicated and he eventually even lost. It seemed to have a big impact on him and after this he started to smoke much less. The rest of us felt sorry for him; he had played a great game and a great tournament and we all know what it feels like to let the team down at such a crucial moment. We had to wait another eight years before we won an Olympic medal for Israel. l.d4 �f6 2.c4 g6 3.tllc3 i.g7 4.e4 d6 5.tlla O-O 6.i.e2 e5 The King's Indian is perhaps the most popular opening for Black among players from the former Yugoslavia.

The idea of putting the knight on a6 was invented by Russian grandmaster Igor Glek. He told me that he was recruited to army training and had to sit in a tank for days with nothing to do, so he speculated about chess. At some point he wondered why no one puts the knight on a6 in the King's Indian. At first he considered the Averbakh system (6.i.g5) and then the Classical system. We have seen it in the Averbakh in my game against Grischuk on page 1 53. As I used to be a King's Indian player, I have of course played it myself quite a number of times.
8.O-O '\W e7!?
This is a rare move. The idea is chat if White plays d4-d5, the queen is much better placed on e7 for various reasons. Other popular moves at this point are 8 ... 'Re8, 8 ... tllg4 and 8 ...c6. 9 . .Bg5 I like this idea, which I found during the game. It brings the ideas of tlld5 and c4-c5 into play. Shortly after the game Khalifman called me and asked me if I had seen this move in his book, as it was his recommendation. I hadn't, but it was a good push to read his books carefully. Later on I won a great game against Peter Svidler, using one of his recommendations. We will see this game in the second volume of this series.

Chapter 5 - Transformation of Advantages 229 9 . . . exd4 A natural choice, but it allows White to set up a slightly better structure. 9 ...c6 would be dubious because of 1 0.c5! when Black is in trouble. 9 ...�e8 would transpose to a theoretical position after 1 0.l:!e l , which has been played by many strong players and could quickly transpose into even more topical lines. But also possible is 1 0.i.xf6 i.xf6 1 1 .c5!, as played by Movsesian and Milos. There is a psychological point here as well. When you play 8 ...�e7, it is not particularly natural to play 9 ...�e8, transposing into the type of lines you rejected just a move ago. This would be more likely to happen in 20 1 5 than in 2000, but still I am not sure there are many players who would do it. A game that made a big impression on me when I was younger was the following. Not because of the great quality of the chess, but because of Polugaevsky's willingness to admit his mistake. He was under attack and decided it was necessary to return the rook to f8, because he would have to play ...h6 and later ...�e8. Objectively this should not have enough to save the game, but then he was playing against a person, not an object ... 1 .e4 c5 2.lllf3 e6 3.d4 cxd4 4.lllxd4 a6 5.lllc3 b5 6 . .Bd3 llle7 7.O-O lllbc6 8.lllb3 lllg6 9.i.e3 i.e7 1 0.f4 d6 1 1 .�hS O-O 1 2.E!:f3!

Clearly Polugaevsky missed this. White is preparing l"!:h3 with lethal intentions. After what we can only imagine was a serious think, he decided to accept the loss of two tempos. 1 3. .. l"!:fS!? 14.l"!:h3? This wins a pawn, but loses a lot of the advantage.
14.l"!:d l !? was interesting and natural, but most
logical was 14.llle4! with a winning attack. For example: 14 ... dxeS 1 5.lllg5! i.xg5 1 6.fxgS and the black king cannot be defended. 14 ...h6 1 5.i.xg6 fxg6 1 6.\Rxg6 Wfe8 1 7.�xe8 l"!:xe8 1 8.exd6 i.xd6 1 9.llle4 i.c7 20.l"!:g3 l"!:f8 2 1 .l"!:fl e5 Black has now equalized. His bishop pair is a clear match for the extra pawn. Maybe Polugaevsky should have played on, though it is easy to understand his feeling of elation at getting a draw out of the game!

[diagram]
When I played 9.Bg5 I was aiming for this position. Obviously it made no sense to think beyond this point. I think White has a fine position. Black has a slight weakness on d6 and White has some space advantage. Added to this, Black does not have the usual active counterplay that makes the King's Indian so playable. The opening was developed by U...c6 Pretty natural. Sooner or later Black will have to eliminate the pin. Chapter 5 - Transformation of Advantages 23 1 Boleslavsky and Bronstein and they almost always managed to create some active play. But with the exchange of two minor pieces, it is not apparent where Black's counterplay will come from. This raises the question, what next? At this point my idea was to consolidate. First I want to prevent Black from playing ... d5 and activating his pieces. 15 ... a5 16Jfadl gds 17JUel i.d7 18 . .ifl Vfie7
[diagram]
The big question here is whether Black should put his pawn on a4 or not. It is really not clear. One the one hand it limits White's option of playing b2-b3 to support the c4- pawn; on the other hand it will expose the pawn later on and force the black pieces to defend it. It is indeed a good question as to which is the right choice. Personally I would prefer to play it, but I do not say this with any certainty of it being the right choice.
19.tlle2
The knight is going to c3 in order to further restrain ...d5. White could also consider l 9.b3, but when Black has already shown that he does not want to play ... a4, there is less motivation to prevent it. Honestly I cannot remember why I made this small decision fifreen years ago. Probably I liked my own ideas and focused on them. There is no way to know for sure.
19. ..
J.es The bishop was not doing well on d7, so it is transferred to f7, from where it controls d5.
20.t£!c3 f6
Here my plan is to manoeuvre around so the rooks can put pressure on the d6-pawn. As White has a slight space advantage, it is easier for him to regroup, which he should use to his advantage. In short, it is not easy for Black to do anything. There is no easy way to change the course of the game, as neither ...d5 or .. .f5 is likely to do any good. 21 .Vfifl .Bf7 22JM2 gd7 23.gedl gad8

At this point I no longer need the knight on c3, so I want to manoeuvre it to d4 (or f4}, which could work well together with J.h3. For this reason I need this move of my b-pawn, which by the way I could have played at any moment.

b c d e f g h I have tried various plans here, including h2-h4-h5, f3-f4 & e4-e5, and so on. Black seems to be able to keep things together with reasonable play. I do not want to give long analysis that will not reflect how the game would have progressed if Black had chosen this slightly passive strategy. The conclusion is rather simple: the play is for two results, where it is more enjoyable to be White. However, the challenge will be to come up with new ways to probe for weaknesses. Black should shuffle his pieces around and find the right moment to push with ...a4 or some other active move. His hope is of course that White loses control of the position, when his dynamic ideas can become very powerful. I should perhaps make a small comment here about evaluating a position. I think it makes a lot of sense to evaluate a position based on whether or not either side is able to improve their position. Humans are prone to make mistakes and more so in some situations than others. Not surprisingly, I try to get my opponents into positions where they are more likely to err, because the hope of winning the game from the beginning without any help from the opponent can most generously be described as unlikely. Still, some people's approach to chess is simply to try and play correctly, and sometimes even I play like this. Why confine yourself to one strategy? We will discuss this further in the next two volumes.
26.l2Je2
[diagram]
At this point I was thinking that I wanted to harass the pawn on a5 a little bit to see how Black would decide to defend it. I would of course be happy to provoke ...b6 (weakening the c6-pawn) and if nothing else, the black rook would be passive on a8. Therefore I vacate c3 for the queen to ask Black what he wants to do. I have to say that I still like this idea fifteen years later, though of course it will have to be done with subtlety. The additional idea here is to play l2Jd4 with Bh3 coming, as mentioned earlier. Chapter 5 - Transformation of Advantages 233 A part of the philosophy behind the squeeze is to try various things and see if the opponent defends well. 26 ... £5 It is obvious that Black was planning this with his last move. If he had wanted to wait, it would have been better to do so with the idea described on the 25th move. 27 .exf5 .lxf5 The structure has changed, but Black has not been able to free himself of his weakness on d6. White continues to be slightly better. 27 ...gxf5? 28.ltlf4 would give Black an even worse structure.

can play 29 ... gxf5 and follow up with ... f5-f4.

29 ...�fi?! After being under pressure for 1 5 moves, Black makes a small mistake that gives White a chance to make a favourable exchange. During the game I felt that Black should activate his rook with: 29 ... :ge? Here it is not so easy to prove an advantage for White. For example, 30.Rf4 can be met by 30 ... :ge5!.
30.Rc3 :gas
Here White has to find a fantastic move to be better. 3 i .:gf2!! Black has tremendous counterplay after both 3 1 .ltlb5 Rxc3 32.ltlxc3 :ge3 and 3 1 .Bg2 :gae8 32.Wal ltld3!. For this reason, White needs this sensational prophylactic move. 3 1 ...id? 32.Rd2 White continues to pose Black problems, and he will continue to manoeuvre. Objectively, White's advantage has not increased greatly, but as the game has progressed, it has become increasingly difficult for Black to find the moves needed to hold. I would also like to add that a move like 3 1 .:gf2 is possible to find for a human, though it might take 20 minutes or more! At this moment I grabbed the chance to improve my structure and to add the miniscule advantage of bishop against knight to the overall evaluation.

At this point I was already short of time. This move does not have any serious idea behind it and Black gets a free move to get organized. Chapter 5 - Transformation of Advantages 235 Furthermore, the rook has no great task to fulfil on the d-line. During the game I was considering 34 . .Bh3, which I probably should have played. However,
34.Wf d2! looks even stronger. After 34 ...
b6 White now plays 35 . .Bh3! with an even better version. Things are highly uncomfortable for Black, who cannot really defend against .Bxf5, E1h6 and so on. This is quite a typical situation for handling an advantage. There comes a moment when you have to play a few accurate moves to exploit the opponent's poor coordination, in order to make the most of your position. This was the moment for me, but sadly on this day I was not up to it. Luckily my opponent was not able to exploit this chance to get back into the game. 34 .• JU6 35.ti'd2 b6 There is nothing wrong with this, but maybe Black could even have looked for active play with 35 ... a4!? 36.b4 lt:le6 with ideas of ...d5 and ... f4.

236 Positional Decision Making in Chess
White has an unpleasant choice between allowing ... lllf2-g4 (after @h2) or exchanging on e4, giving Black a strong passed pawn. In either case White might have a few winning chances still, but Black has really managed to get back into the game in a big way.
38.f4 �e4
This allows White to simplify the position in his favour, but otherwise the bishop remains superior to the knight, so Black's task was already difficult. 38 ...Wc? was possible, but after something like 39 . .iB White continues to improve his position.
[diagram]
Black has made something out of the knight and it is no longer inferior to White's bishop, but this comes at a price. Not only will the black e-pawn be a target, but White also gets a chance to expand on the kingside and push his newly created passed pawn.

1-0 Transforming dynamic and static advantages The next game shows quite a nice twist. In athbe opening I sacrificed a pawn in return for ig centre and a lead in development, as I have done many, many times. However, when my opponent weakened his pawn structure, I was quick to upgrade my initiative into a better structure, with the option of having an extra pawn. There was nothing special about this, but what makes this game interesting is that when my opponent (quite rightly) tried to create active counterplay, I found a way to give up the extra pawn and instead recapture the initiative, using it to create a winning attack on the seventh rank. Boris Gelfand - Mark Tseitlin Tel Aviv 1 999 Tseitlin is a very aggressive player who constantly seeks his opponent's king. He is originally from St Petersburg, but immigrated to Israel in 1 990, where he had his best chess years, earning the GM title in 1 997 and achieving his highest rating (2545) in 1 995. He has won the European Senior Championship four times and also the team event once.

This gambit used to be my favourite line; I even wrote a chapter on it in My Most Memorable Games. For the pawn White gets space and a lead in development. It used to be great fun to play, but sadly these days it has been analysed too heavily and it becomes a memory test more than a game of chess to play this way.

While Tseitlin was thinking, I was wondering what I would do against 1 6. .. tLic4, becoming a little worried and feeling a gust of relief when he did not find it.

This strong move switches from the theme of the strong centre and harassing the black queen. Instead the idea of taking on b6 and regaining the pawn comes to the foreground. Black will still have weaknesses on b7, e6 and e7 to deal with. I think it is quite a clever idea, leading to a really horrible situation for Black.

At this point I had planned 1 8.Wb l , when there are a lot of complications that are not as clear as I had imagined. This approach is too concrete. Instead a simple route to an advantage is 1 8.'\Re2! 'it>h8 ( 1 8. .. llld6 1 9.Bxa7 and White just has a big structural advantage) 1 9.Ei:fb l and White will at least win back his pawn, on account of 1 9. ..b6? 20.Bc4 Rc6 2 1 .Bd5 and White wins an exchange. 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1

244 Positional Decision Making in Chess
The two bishops - a long-term dynamic advantage Usually we talk about an advantage being short-term or long-term, or dynamic and static, if you like. This is at times a little too simplistic. In the next game we shall see the power of the two bishops dominating two knights which have no good squares available. During the game I had options of using their superiority in both dynamic and static ways, either to support an attack or to squeeze my opponent, making him choose between various bad endings. I chose the latter, mainly because I did not see the attacking possibilities! Boris Gelfand - Sergey Rublevsky Palma de Mallorca 2008 Sergey Rublevsky is a good friend of mine and has been so for a long time. As a player he has been a part of the elite for many years; he was a regular top 20 player, qualified for the Candidates, beat Kasparov and so on. These days he seems to be focusing more on being a trainer than a player, for Kramnik during his World Championship matches and later for the Russian women's team when they won the Olympiads in 20 1 2 and 20 1 4. He has quite a narrow, but well thought-out opening repertoire. He has played the Queen's Gambit Accepted throughout his entire career. It was only recently that he added some Slav lines to this. He is similarly narrow in his approach to the white pieces. I think he must analyse the opening phase of his own games very deeply in order to come up with something new again and again. In the opinion of Igor Zaitsev (Karpov's second for many years), Rublevsky plays in Bogoljubow's style. I do not really understand what this means, but at least it is nice to know that I am not the only player whose style matches a great player from the past. 1 .d4 d5 2.c4 dxc4 3.e4 This is the most ambitious and challenging system. It requires more knowledge than other systems, as Black can play a lot of moves here. 3 ...e5 This is the standard move for Rublevsky. The main alternatives are 3 ...c5, 3 ... lllf6 and 3 ... lllc6, and recently 3 ...b5 has also become quite popular.
4.�f3 .tb4t
However, in this posmon Rublevsky was making a real choice. If you exclude this game from the statistics, he has scored 50% with this move, performing slightly below his expected score. After 4 ...exd4 5.Bxc4 lllc6 6.O-O Be6 there are 1 1 games in my database where Rublevsky is Black. He has a + 3 score, exceeding his expected score slightly.
5.�c3
A matter of taste.
5.lllbd2? does not work on account of 5 ...c3.
But White can try 5.Bd2 Bxd2t 6.lllbxd2 exd4 7.Bxc4 \Rf6, which has happened in a Chapter 5 - Transformation of Advantages 245 lot of games, including some with Rublevsky as Black. But it almost feels like an entirely different opening. s ...exd4 6.tllxd4 This recapture offers White more possibilities. It is also possible to exchange queens with the more simplistic 6.Wi'xd4, which will suit people who like simple positions and try to win by technique alone. I feel that White's advantage is too small, but that is of course just one opinion. Karpov has played it a few times with success, but as Rublevsky has experience in this line with Black as well, I doubt it would have caused him real problems. This is a problem when you play players that repeat the same lines all the time - you need to bring something real to the table, or they will equalize without difficulties. 6 ...�e7 A playable move that does not look wrong at all. However, 6 ... tlld7 7 . .Bxc4 lDgf6 8.O-O O-O is generally preferred nowadays.
7.hc4 �bc6 8.i.e3 O-O
9.a3
An important move.
9.O-O ltJxd4 I O. .Bxd4 ltJc6 offers an easy
route co equality, as can for example be seen in one of the key games for this line, Bologan - Rublevsky, Saint Vincent 2005.
9.liJdbS Ba5 also offers Black decent chances.
Again Rublevsky has been Black in five games from this position. It feels likely chat Rublevsky has analysed these lines deeply and knows how to eliminate the apparent pressure from White. 9 ...hc3t I think this capture is more or less forced. The problem is that if he goes: 9 ...Ba5 1 0.O-O lDxd4 (If he plays the natural 1 0. .. .Bb6, then I reply 1 1 .lDxc6 lDxc6 1 2. .Bxb6 axb6 and I am in time for 1 3.f4 with a fine position} 1 l ..Bxd4 ltJc6

I now have l 2 . .Bc5 with some advantage.
10.bxc3 �as
Taking on d4 makes no sense anymore, as I can cake back with the pawn. 1 1 .Ae2 It is a good question where the bishop belongs. Against Hubner I placed the bishop on a2, which seems to be a bad choice as it will simply
246 Positional Decision Making in Chess
be exchanged, as Robert did against me: I l .Ba2 b6 12.Re2 c5 1 3.lDb5 lDg6 14.l:!d l Re7 1 5.O-O Be6 1 6.Bxe6 fXe6 1 7.f4 l:!ad8 1 8.l:!xd8 l:!xd8 1 9.e5 Rd7 20.lDd6 Y2-Y2 Gelfand - Hubner, Munich 1 994. So I think putting the bishop on e2 is more ambitious. It was not exactly a new move; Kamsky had played it against Shore in their 1 994 Candidates match, though Short played so poorly that it is rather irrelevant for this game. Instead we will follow Bareev - lvanchuk, as referred to below.

It might look dangerous for Black and it requires accurate and deep preparation; but I am sure that Rublevsky did his work.

My improvement for this game. Bareev played 1 3.Rc2, which is also natural, and he went on to win in Bareev - lvanchuk, Dortmund 1 992. Still, I find my move more appealing. It forces Black's reply and thus wins a bit of time. White wants to play lDf5 and Chapter 5 - Transformation of Advantages obtain the advantage of two bishops against two knights, so why delay?

Executing my plan. At this point I was sure he was going to take on f5 and he did so without too much thought.

14. ..
J.xf5? This normal-looking move turns out to be highly questionable. 1 4. .. WfeS! I did not consider this surprising resource at all during the game. It looks too artificial, but this is often the case with subtle moves, so we have to go a bit deeper. I would seriously consider these options for White: 1 5.Wfc2 l 5.f4 Wfe8! gives White problems with his centre. The e3-bishop is loose, so White is forced to play l 6.Wfxe8 �xe8 l 7.�g3, when Black has many ideas. For example: l 7 ...�e7!? with ideas of ...Be6 or ... f5. I am sure Black is fine here. A nice trick arises in the following line: 1 5.Bd4 Wfxe4 1 6.Bf3 Wfxf5 1 7.Bxa8 where Black will not go for l 7 ...Bd7? 1 8.Be4! with complicated play, but simply l 7 ...Ba6 with a big advantage. 1 5. ..ixfS 1 6.exfS �e7
[diagram]
This is a better square for the knight than in the game, which is paradoxical. At first glance, e5 looks like a more active and natural square, but as we shall see in the following, the knight is unstable there. Obviously it helps that the knight attacks the f5-pawn from e7. On e5 it looks pretty, but it is not able to do much for Black's position.
15.exf5 �e5 16.l:fadl gad8
[diagram]
The operations of the opening are at an end and it makes sense to take stock of what has happened. Let us start with the conclusion: White has the advantage. First of all, White has two good bishops in a fairly open position. They are well placed and will be useful in the long run. Compare this with the black knights, which are struggling to find stability. Black does have the nicer pawn structure, but
248 Positional Decision Making in Chess
White's split pawns are not without potential.
17.h3!
A natural improvement of the position, which can be useful in many ways. White might consider g2-g4, but also he just does not want to get back-rank mated or hit by a ... lllg4 tactic. This might all seem very simple and logical when described, but it took me 25 minutes to decide on this move! In the event of 1 7. :Sfe l , Black can exchange rooks and White will have gained nothing from his last move. The question is what Black should do in this position besides exchanging on d l . There is no obvious way to fight for equality.
17. . J�d6
By preparing to bring the other rook to the d-file, Rublevsky provokes me to cake on d6. He intends to recapture with the c-pawn in order to bring the other rook to the c-file, to put pressure on c3 and also occupy the c4-square. During the game I was worried about: 1 7. .. lllb7!? This would have been a concrete attempt to solve Black's problems with a pawn sacrifice. The proof of the pudding is in the eating, and the same often goes for pawn sacrifices; we have to take it. .. 1 8.'1Mfxa7 lllc5
[diagram]
I was not sure about this position at all, but it turns out chat White has plenty of resources. Black is not really threatening ... lllc6. The main refutation comes from the computer. l 9.:Sxd8! :Sxd8 20.a4! With the idea a4-a5 and also chat the white bishop would be protected on b5. le seems chat White is just a pawn up. 20 ... lllc6 Black can also try 20 ... llle4, but White has no problems after 2 l ..Bxb6 lllxc3 22 . .Ba6 lllf.3t 23.<J;>h l and I cannot see what threats Black is supposed to have. 2 1 ..Bxc5 bxc5 22.Rb7 A pawn up, White is close to winning. So my concerns during the game were not justified, but it is better to be worried about critical tries from the opponent than to be oblivious of them! Black could of course try other moves, such as regrouping the knight with 1 7. .. llld7. Here White can try 1 8.Rb4!?, when provoking Black to play 1 8. ..cS would be quite an achievement, and after 1 9.Rf4 White has a fine position with the possibility of expanding on the kingside with if.3 and g2-g4-g5. 1 7. .. :Sfe8 1 8.:Sd4 also looks pleasant for White. Again it would be welcome if Black played 1 8. ..c5, when after 1 9.:Sxd8 :Sxd8
20.:Sd l White is for choice.
We see that in general that White would love Black to play ...c5, taking the square away from the knights. As Mihail Marin likes to say: the knights will find it hard to achieve stability. Ac this point White has a long-term advantage of two bishops against two knights, which brings us to the thematic question of this chapter: what should we do once we have the advantage? Obviously I can only tell you how Chapter 5 - Transformation of Advantages I approach this situation and the reader will then have to work out for himself if he finds this approach useful.
[diagram]
My main approach is to think, "What should I do next?" During the game I will seriously consider which transformations would be to my advantage and which would not. But in general I am just looking for a way to improve the position. In this position the main thing for White is to create a function for the rook on fl . As the bishops are solidly placed on the e-file, my next move is not too difficult.
18.gd4 �ac6
Forcing White to take on d6. I had of course anticipated this, but felt that the circumstances were different. Black has lost a vital tempo putting the knight on the inferior c6-square. This is an important part of thinking about transformations. Dynamics is a big part of chess and thus dynamic considerations will always be important. 19Jhd6 There are positive reasons to play this for White as well; essentially the d6-pawn is now a target in a way the pawn on c7 never was. After l 9.l:'i:e4 I did not like l 9 ... Rf6, when I did not feel my pieces would be well coordinated. The rook looks stupid on e4.
19. ..
cxd6 l 9 ... Rxd6 20.Re4 is also unpleasant for Black. It is not clear where the knight will go from e5. Again, the knight lacks stability.
[diagram]
20J�dl This is a fine move that leaves White much better, though I have to admit that I missed a nice tactical possibility.

250 Positional Decision Making in Chess
This direct attack works, though 24.Rd4 is also good enough for White. 24 ... llle5 25.Rh4 cj;>hs Black can defend his weak squares in the short term, but White wins by bringing the rook into the attack.
26.!'le l ! !'lg8 27.!'le3 Rd8 28.ct?h l

32.�e8!!
Black has no defence against Rg3 on the next move, winning at least a piece. The above tactical finesse might look like a random chance, but that is not how I see it. Chess is a logical game and the tactical chances we get come from our play earlier in the game. That Black could have been punished for misplacing his pieces is natural. Of course nothing is really spoiled by my missing this move; the problems that allowed it are still there, and Black is teetering on the edge of defeat. It is quite common that we miss a chance or two in an overwhelming position but win anyway, because the plan we choose is also good enough. 20 . . . 1"lc8 Black is still dreaming of ... lt:\a5-c4.

22.f4? ll'Bc4 would be an unpleasant surprise.
Shortly after the game I had the feeling that it might have been better to play the more direct

ll'Ba5 the best I have been able to find is to transpose to a line that could have occurred in the game: Chapter 5 - Transformation of Advantages 25 1

23 . .Ba6! (23.Rxd6?! Rxd6 24.l::1 xd6 tllac4 brings Black's pieces to life and thus gives him real drawing chances.) Now Black should play 23 ... l::1 c7! transposing to the line given in the note to Black's 23rd move below, as I do not believe Black can hold the endgame after 23 ... l::1 xc3?! 24 . .Bd2 l::1 c5 25.Ra8t Rf8 26.Rxf8t ci>xf8 27 . .Bb4 die7 28 . .ixcS bxc5 29 . .ibS!, though nothing is certain, of course. 22 . .ibS!? was an interesting move that I did not seriously consider during the game. It also leads to interesting options for White, but is not a clearer path to an advantage than the game continuation. During the game you have to choose between options that attract you, and this was not one of the things I looked at. 22 • • Jk7 22 ... l::1 d8 would be poorer, though it contains a lovely trap: 23.f4? d5! 24.l::1 xd5 tllf3t would allow Black back into the game.

White has a pleasant choice. After 28.:B:d5 f6 29.j,xe5 fxe5 30.:B:xe5, White has an extra pawn and decent control over the position.
28.j,xe5 llixd6 29.j,xd6 :B:xc3 would give
White a little less control over the position; on the other hand he would have two bishops against a rook. This line would open up the possibility that after exchanging pawns on the queenside, Black might be able to draw, albeit after a lot of suffering. I am not saying this would happen, but there is a risk.

The opinion was almost universally the opposite of mine. I have not done any serious analytical work on this and it remains guesswork. The argument against my view is that White will be unable to attack any weakness twice. On the other hand the bishops are very strong and can potentially dominate everything.

After 32.Bxd6 �xc3 33.ibS White uses the tempo to win a pawn, after which the rest is a matter of technique. 32J�d7 Black is in a common scenario. He had the option of going into inferior endings at various points, but after not choosing any of them, he ends up in one that appears even worse than all the alternatives.

1-0 Conversion from nothing to nothing! There are times when we transform the position simply because we need to do something. In this case we are not looking for a way to preserve an advantage but for a way to preserve equality, or for a way to set different problems for our opponents. In the following game there are a number of interesting possibilities for both players to transform the position. Initially Black has to choose between the ...c5 and ...e5 options. Later on White needs to choose between different ways to pose problems for Black. In the endgame Black probably chooses the wrong strategy of waiting solidly, hoping that White cannot improve his position greatly. This leads to a critical position at move 37, where White forces matters and Black has to come up with a sequence of only moves to avoid losing quickly. As so often happens, this is not as easy as it sounds ... Boris Gelfand - Laurent Fressinet Canada de Calatrava (rapid) 2007 This game was played in a strong rapid event in Spain. It was the second edition of the tournament and the only time I took part. I tied for first with Shirov, Fridman and Ivan Sokolov, ahead of other such strong grandmasters as Anand, Mamedyarov, Polgar, Grischuk, Karpov and so on. Fressinet is essentially a classical player with a broad knowledge. He has seconded both Kramnik and Carlsen in World Championship matches. He can play all types of positions well, and does not have an obvious weakness as far as I can see. When he was younger he was quite tactical, but he has clearly matured. I have played quite a number of games against him and, as he pointed out, I tend to have achieved my best results when he was also taking part in the tournament (not necessarily dependent on our individual result) . In 20 1 3 I won both the Paris Grand Prix and the Alekhine Memorial, where he also took part, as well as a few other tournaments over the years. So naturally he suggested that I should press organizers of the big tournaments to invite not only me, but also him.

At the time when this game was played, if you opened l .d4 you would reach this position more often than any other. Chapter 5 - Transformation of Advantages 255
4.Wfb3
This move is becoming more popular these days. The main reason is that it has less theory associated with it than for example
4.lllc3, where Black has a big choice between
the Classical Slav, the Semi-Slav and the Chebanenko Slav. White wants to have a long positional game, rather than trying to win from the opening. 4 •• • dxc4 s.Wfxc4 .Bg4 Fressinet chooses the more dynamic of the two main options here. 5 ... i.f5 is the other main line.
6.tllc3 �bd7 7.e4
7 ...e6 A reasonable move, signalling that Black also does not wish to debate opening theory, but would rather start slowly and see what opportunities present themselves along the way. It could be argued that this move is a little passive and for this reason is a concession that gives White a minimal advantage. This is the standard price of avoiding main-line theory, although in this case I do not believe it is anything special. Obviously Black could also take on f3 first and then play ...e6. The main theoretical line here is 7 ... i.xf3
8.gxf3 e5, where hundreds of games has
been played. One of the biggest discoveries in opening theory the last few years was that Black is doing fine after: 9.dxe5 lllxe5 1 0.Wi'e2 i.c5 l l .i.d2 lllh5 1 2.f4 Wi'xd2t!! I would add that the immediate 7 ...e5!? is a possible and beautiful move, which Carlsen has played. It was also the recommendation by Boris Avrukh in his recent book Grandmaster Repertoire 1 7 - The Classical Slav. 8 . .Be3 .Be7 9 . .Be2 O-O 10.O-O

With only one piece for the queen at this point, Black is relying on big compensation on the dark squares.
[diagram]
This is typical for this variation. White has a space advantage, but Black's position is solid.
256 Positional Decision Making in Chess
There are some similarities with the standard lines of the Slav, where White has to play a2- a4 to get his pawn back, but then manages to build a strong centre. Here White did not weaken his position with a4, but on the other hand he has wasted a few tempos with his queen, which will need to retreat soon. In my opinion, White should aim to consolidate at this point. 10 ... :ScS A logical move. Black is considering playing both ...b5 and ...c5. 10 ...b5?! immediately is too much. l 1 .Rxc6 b4 1 2.lllb5 does not offer quite enough compensation for the pawn. This is quite logical, as Black does not look ready for active play. 1 o ...�h5 has been played by a number of strong guys (in blitz!). The bishop is going to g6, which seems quite reasonable as well. White has a slight plus score, but I find such statistics meaningless. There are too few games, and a novelty might even mean that a line is abandoned, though statistically it seems excellent! I would like to add that I would be happy to play this position from either side. In a tournament like this, where you do not know who you will face until three minutes before the game, theoretical discussions rarely occur. The players are usually happy to get out of the opening with a decent position with everything to play for. l l.�b3 Quite a normal move. 1 1...�b6 1 1 ...b5?! would be imprecise due to 1 2.e5, when Black has an unpleasant choice. If the knight goes backwards, White has a comfortable space advantage, whereas after 1 2. .. llld5 1 3.lllxd5 cxd5 1 4.�xb5 E:b8 1 5.Rd3 Black does not have enough compensation for the pawn. 1 1 ...Rc7 is probably best met with 1 2.E:acl �h5 1 3.h3 �g6 1 4.llld2 and White might be slightly better.

This is a reasonable decision, though it should probably be followed by ...c5 rather than ...e5. 1 5. ..c5 This will mainly transpose, but there are a few details that it makes sense to include here. 1 6.d5 If Black is allowed to take on d4, then he equalizes.

The complications continue, but after 22.:B:xd7 i.xg5 Black is threatening both ... tDh2t and ... i.xcl , leaving White in an uncomfortable situation. l 7 ... exd5 l 7 ... c4!? would be an attempt to make the position double-edged, rather than to equalize. Black has not shown this desire so far. 1 8.exd5
[diagram]
have analysed this position further and it seems that there is no clear way for White to claim an advantage. He does have the two bishops and a passed pawn, but the pawn is quite safely guarded and there are excellent squares for the black bishop and knights on the dark squares. It would be easy to confuse everything with a lot of variations, but essentially they would only confirm the optical impression, which is that Black should be okay with accurate play.

A sensible move. It was also possible for White to play l 7.d5 cxd5 1 8.exd5 or l 7.tDe2!? with slight pressure in both cases.

The following manoeuvre is questionable. On the surface 1 7. .. '!Rxe5 1 8.i.h4 may look unpleasant for Black, but what he did in the game looks less logical. The knight takes two moves to get to a square that is no better than where it came from.
18.i.e2 �g6 19.g3
At this point White would be doing really well if he had an additional move to play f2-f4 and i.f3, preparing e4-e5. It is therefore Black's task to neutralize White's pressure before it becomes too great.

'!Wes Bringing the queen back into the game. I wondered if Black could play l 9 ... i.c5?! but White has a nice tactic: 20.i.xf6 gxf6 2 l .i.g4!

As mentioned above, White would love to have an extra tempo to play Bf3 and e4-e5, but things are not that easy. The resulting structure is unpleasant for Black, but tenable none the less. 2 1 ...h6 Not a pleasant move to make, but sooner or later Black will have to play this move to force White to take on f6, so he might as well make it now.
22.Bxf6 gxf6!
[diagram]
An important move. Black has to choose this structure to prevent e4-e5. It is a sad way to play, but with the manoeuvre ... tllf8-e6-d4 coming, White will not have a great advantage. If White could get his knight to f5, things would be hunky-dory, but there is no express route to make it happen. I have analysed this position some more and with a few good moves, Black is okay. 20 ... .Bc5 This is a must. If White is allowed to play f2-f4 and keep his big centre and the two bishops, his chances will be high.
[diagram]
At this point White can no longer keep the two bishops, but has to accept the exchange of what is probably his best piece. In return I was able to transform the position into an endgame where Black has a small weakness and has knight against bishop. It is certainly not a lot and my feeling during the game was that the position was definitely defendable. 21 .hc5 '!Rxc5 22.tlld5 The concrete approach.

Black has to play 26 ...gbs. White's position is pleasant, though his advantage is modest. I should probably admit that I was planning to reply 23.Wfxe4, which is less dangerous. On the other hand, it is very dangerous for Black to enter these complications. If something were to go wrong, he would find himself simply lost. So it is very natural to go for liquidation as Laurent did. Sure, he has a slightly worse pawn structure, but on the other hand he has control of the d-line. In my opinion, Black's position in the game looks more defendable than the alternatives.
23.lNxf6t gxf6 24.gxd8t gxd8 25.gxc2

25 ... lNf'8 A natural rerouting of the knight, though it does give White time to improve his position. 25 ... llle7 26.Qfl f5 was also possible, but it is not clear that the exchange of the f6-pawn will improve things for Black. The remaining pawns are still split and we should not forget that the doubled f-pawns are useful defenders in a number of endgames. For example, were we to exchange minor pieces and remove all pawns from the queenside, White would have no winning chances to speak of, despite having an extra pawn.
26.f.3 lNe6 27.@f'l
The way I understood this ending - which proved to be correct - is that Black will have to make committal decisions, while White can manoeuvre around, waiting for a chance.

In the game Black decided to do nothing and just wait. Although it is probably still sufficient, I do not think it was a very practical choice. It is of course worth checking: 27 ... llld4 The most challenging option seems to be:

I like this move, taking control of the d4- square, though Black can still go back to the idea of putting the knight on d4. 29 .. J:Bd7 29 ...c5!? 30.f4 b6 is interesting. White plays 3 1 .b4, when after 3 1 ...cxb4 32.gxb4 llic5
33.gd4 Black needs to consider if he would

30.f4
White is making miniscule progress and actually has a slight advantage here, which only means that Black has to play more accurately than White in order to keep the balance. 30 ...h6 Black continues his waiting strategy. It is too late for 30 ...c5, as White plays 3 l .f5, winning a pawn.

If Black just waits, it is possible to make progress. For example: 3 l ...gd8 32.ga4!? a6
33.ga5! �f8 34.i.g4 gd7 35.e5 and although
it is not much, White has managed to improve his position slightly. If you want to improve your ability in playing such positions, I can recommend a close study of Karpov's and Carlsen's games. 32 . .Bg4 gds 33.b4 Minor improvements have combined to form a clear improvement of the position compared to ten moves ago. Black is waiting and since White is not under the illusion that he will be able to win quickly, he simply improves his position slowly. 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 8 7 6 5 4 3 2

[diagram]
Is the bishop better placed on this diagonal? During the game I thought so, but of course it is hard to say for certain. To some extent I am using a simple technique: move the pieces around, probing for weaknesses. The idea that we can see all the possible plans and cricks from the beginning may be emotionally attractive, but it is not in line with experience. Things will show up that we did not consider. 36 ... llid4 36 ... llic7 37.Ei:d3 Ei:c8 38.a4 is also a small further improvement for White. Black's position is unpleasant, but should still be defendable. But from where we started out, unpleasant is a big step in the right direction. Who is to say chat this will not be the direction of travel for the rest of the game? I know I have said it elsewhere in this book, but my editor has assured me chat repeating important points will only help the reader to appreciate chem, so here I go again: Chess is a game and the practical dimension should not be underestimated. The evaluation of pleasant/ unpleasant is often more useful than +0.73 or whatever the engine is saying. How difficult is the posmon to play in practice? That is what will determine the result, more than any computer evaluation.
37.�d3!
This forces matters in a situation where neither player has enough time to determine the consequences of the various pawn endings. This is a sensible practical decision, as all the responsibiliry lies on Black to find the right moves - and this without the knowledge we have in hindsight, chat there actually is a way to hold. During the game I was thinking that this would lead to a "slighcly better pawn ending". Pawn endings have four possible outcomes: winning, losing, drawn or a transition into a queen ending. But as always, an advantage means chat the position is easier to play as much as anything. With 37.i.a4 White could continue to put slight pressure on Black, but is unlikely to pose as many problems to the opponent as the move played in the game does.
[diagram]
37 ... llie6? The pawn ending is rather complicated and the following variations are of course the product of computer analysis and not my own Chapter 5 - Transformation of Advantages 263 speculations during the game. For this reason I have chosen to give the moves with few notes. Pawn endings are very concrete and in this case correct play leads to a draw. 37 ... lllxb3!

The overall principle of Transformation of Advantages is easy to understand, but judging when and how to do so is one of the most difficult aspects of chess. There are numerous possibilities and this chapter has by no means tried to list them all; however, I hope I have gone some way towards illustrating the spirit and the mechanics of transformation in a way that benefits the reader.

Appendix I Cannot Leave My House! Interview with Jacob Aagaard - 2012 In conversation with Vishy
266 Positional Decision Making in Chess
Hi Boris, how are you doing? I am doing okay. I am still very tired, but it should get better. How has the reaction been in Israel? It is something unbelievable; I cannot leave the house! I go onto the street and people stop me. When you enter my city there is a billboard saying, "For us you are the champion." It is unbelievable; I really cannot understand it. I went out this morning and I could not walk more than a few metres between people stopping to greet me. Let us start with the obvious question - what is your overall impression of the match? It was a great moment for me. I really enjoyed it and I woke up every day thinking, 'What a great day this is - I am going to play another game.' So I am full of very positive emotions. I prepared for months and you saw that I chose some new openings and I changed the attitude in my game. I am happy that I managed to put most of the things I prepared into practice. It looked to me as ifyou were trying to either take the initiative or at least prevent Anand from taking the initiative. Kind 0£ It is very difficult to face Anand when he has the initiative. He is the greatest player of our time. So, yes, it was my strategy not to let him get the initiative. Let us go through the critical moments in the match. Maybe we can start with you choosing the moments you found critical in the match. You know it is hard for me to decide on this, as I was focusing on each game separately. But the decisive games were of course always critical. And of course Game 3 where I was lucky to escape. In Game 3 there were some commentators who felt that Anand did not have the ability to concentrate fully at this critical moment. What is your opinion on this?

37.@cl gxa2.]
I do not think you should judge him based on one mistake. The opinion that Anand is no longer the same player comes from a well-respected great ex-champion and too many people are putting too much weight on this. I find that this opinion is really biased. In the Topalov match Anand made even bigger mistakes than in this match, blundering in a drawn position, but no one said that Anand was in poor form then. But then Anand was of course accepting his assistance in 20 1 0, but no one wanted it in 20 1 2. .. If Anand had managed to get the initiative he would have proved that he was in good form, but he could not get the initiative. The mistake in Game 3 - well, these things happen. I am not entirely sure what actually went wrong for him. Maybe it was some kind of mental black-out. Or maybe chess is just diffi cult? Well, to play 34.d? is not so difficult, but I am not sure it was fully winning. I am still analysing it. To push the pawn was not difficult, but to find the win was. It would have put me under great pressure, but I am still not sure it is winning. After 34 ..J :k5 it is not so simple. I can give you a line if you are interested? I have not analysed everything to the end yet, so probably my analysis is not so precise. I am very interested! So: 34 ... l:!c5 35.l:!exh7 l:!d l t 36.mb2 l:!d2t 37.ma3 b5 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 And then White has 38.:!:!4h6t.

White should be winning, but still there are practical chances. Bue co find moves 38-40 is, how can I say it, not so simple. Bue objectively this was the way co win the game. But what you could argue is that it was simpler to see that it was just a draw as it came in the game, at least ifyou have Anand's calibre. Yes, yes, I totally agree. After he played 34.�c? I first thought he wanted co win time by repeating the position with 35.�e?, so I was really shocked when he played 35.�h l .

Arkadij Naiditsch was commentating on this game on the Internet and said that there was an easy draw here. This is a case where you need to distinguish between what can easily be found by a computer, who shows it in a split second, and what can easily be found by a human brain. This is not the same. This really makes me laugh when I hear such things. Obviously not only Arkadij makes such comments. The surprising thing is that he made it, because he is a great player. Normally it comes from amateurs. Maybe Arkadij was too deep into the game? I don't want to give the wrong impression; only to say that during the game it was not easy at all. The next obvious moments are Game 7 and Game 8. [For Game 7 see page 1 92] Of course. I was personally deeply impressed by the idea of �d2 and E:cl . Who found this idea? 'We' found it. It was a team effort. First I tried the b3-system, then the '\Rc2-system. So I decided that it is time to dig deeply in the c5-system. There are not so many systems against 5 ...a6, which might explain why Anand chose it. It is pretty easy to prepare against three systems only. [l.d4 d5 2.c4 c6 3.�8 �f6 4.�c3 e6 5.e3 a6 6.c5 �bd7] Anyway, I tried to dig into the only system I had not tried. After 7.�d3 Black can play 7 ...e5 as Aronian did against me in Wijk aan Zee 2008. And after 7.b4 Black can play 7 ...b6 - there were some recent games with this. So I started to think about alternatives. So 7.V!f cl popped up. It is much better suited to meet ... e5 and against ...b6 White can take. So we used logic to find it. Then we analysed it and decided that it poses new problems. + +. - 0

Another thing which is interesting about this game is that I managed to play it in the style of my favourite player, Rubinstein, where you have one idea and you play according to it in all of the game.

This is also why I played 16. .Bg3 instead of the objectively stronger I 6.i.xf6. Of course I also underestimated the llie2-g3-h5 manoeuvre. But I saw that 1 6.i.g3 would keep a nice initiative. If this had not been the case, probably I would have taken on f6. Later on 20 ... gabS is bad. After 20 ... E:c7 White has to play very precisely in order to get an advantage. Alex Huzman found the only way to play for an advantage, 2 1 .%Ve l ! and only after 2 l ... E:ac8 White should play 22.lt'Ba4 with the idea llic5. Basically it is prophylaxis against ... %Vb4. 20 ... E:ab8 is basically wasting of a tempo. In the Bth game you based your calculations on 1 4. .. %Vf6, but it just did not work. Yes, but you know, I think the general approach was correct. When White plays 7.lt'iec3 it is obvious to me that you have to do something on the kingside. I should also say that I played this game without feeling any pressure by the fact that I was leading the match. Unfortunately it backfired. I can tell you what went wrong, after: 9 • • • exf6 10.Vfd2 f'5 1 1.exf5 .Bxf5 Appendix - I Cannot Leave My House! 271 White has so many possibilities, so 1 7.Vfff2 escaped my attention.

So I calculated all of these lines and in the end I missed l 7.Wff2 and the position is so bad after this that I had co resign. It was just a blunder. How did you react to this blunder emotionally? I was pretty calm. Maybe too calm. I do not know why, but I was pretty calm. OK, it can happen. It is a long match and I decided that it would be better just to forget about it and concentrate on the next game; and this is what I cried to do.

272 Positional Decision Making in Chess
To me Game 9 seemed to be the most critical game of the match. I probably agree. Maybe move 19 [where Boris played 19.c5] was the critical moment of the game? Do you think you wanted to be too much in control when you played this move? I shall tell you what happened. First of all it was not possible to calculate everything to the end. Secondly, I was fully aware that fortresses are Vishy's bread and butter. He did it very often, even in our mutual games. I knew there was a serious risk that this would happen. But I also did not see how I should continue if l played 1 9.a3 and he simply waited. So I thought, "No matter what I do, there is risk involved." Maybe I would have to play c4-c5 in worse circumstances. So I invested a lot of time trying to calculate the endgame and I decided that with the damaged pawn structure on the kingside and the pawn on a6, I would create another weakness on the kingside and I would break through. I was totally sure that it was won from an assessment point of view.
[diagram]
Appendix - I Cannot Leave My House! 273 And maybe with 33.g4 I would have been able to do it. I am not completely sure. I have not had time to analyse it deeply yet. I believe that if l had been able to put my pawn on f5 I would have won. But I played imprecisely and did not manage to achieve this. I simply missed that he could put his pawn on f5. But of course 15 ...ixB was also a very strange mistake forAnand to make. Of course. But I think Anand even admitted someplace that he mistook the position for that of an old Karpov game. [Portisch - Karpov, Bugojno 1 978 - actually Black could transpose to this game with 1 5. ..h6! 1 6. .Bd2 l:!fe8 1 7.l:!el and now 1 7. ..ixB! 1 8.Wfxf3 e5 with even chances.] He intended to play 16 ... e5, but then realized that l 7 . .Bf5! wins the exchange. I was completely shocked, not realizing immediately what was going on. This is also one of the moments that make people say that '�his is not the same Anand as we used to know ': These things happen. We will see what happens in the next few tournaments. Before his match against Kramnik in 2008 he played really badly in Bilbao [two losses and eight draws, ending in last place] , much worse than before this match. But then he won against Kramnik and against Topalov, and did well in so many tournaments. So I don't see a pattern of decline so far. Do you think that you were a bigger challenge to Anand than Kramnik and Topalov? I think I created more problems for him than they did. I am not sure of the exact reason; maybe I was more successful in my opening preparation. Kramnik got caught in this Meran line twice and the match was simply over. Things were less easy against Topalov of course. I should say that the thing I find really interesting about the match is that you can make a grand strategy for the match in a way you cannot do in a tournament. You can push forward your strategy throughout the match, which makes it more interesting for me than a tournament. In matches the players' style and how they interact with each other is much more important than in tournaments as well. Don't get me wrong, tournaments are also interesting, but matches are played only rarely, which is perhaps why I cherish them so much. For example: before the match I analysed Anand's games deeply and realized that he was fantastic with the initiative and that I simply should not give it to him. And it worked. Do you think the public like matches less because you need fewer decisive results to win? Too many people follow chess for us to generalize. People like different things. This is not the Eurovision Song Contest. We do not have to follow the majority view. A lot of people like chess. Some prefer tournaments, others matches, some rapid chess and so on. Fortunately we have all kinds of events at the moment so everyone can choose to follow the event that suits them best.
274 Positional Decision Making in Chess
Unfortunately the great majority of the public is not interested in chess at all. Let us for example take these complaints about the number of draws. Last year I played in Tai Memorial [Moscow 20 1 1 ] , which was maybe the most interesting tournament in the last few years based on the quality of the games. Then three rounds in a row there were more or less only draws, because everybody defended excellently and big advantages were not converted. People started to complain, but people who watched the games appreciated it. Or let me give you another example, an excellent example. Last year Shirov started with 3Yz/4 in Lublin. Then he saved an ending two pawns down in almost a hundred moves against Sasikiran and in the final round he sacrificed the queen against Grachev, a game that ended with a perpetual check.

I was really laughing. And the journalist; how dare he write this? He said: "Oh, I had not time to check the games, so I decided to just write something." Unfortunately the people who watch the games do not have time to comment on them, so we are left with these people making comments that "the games are boring" and things like this. So the people who did not watch the games were unhappy. What can you do? But I can say in this match that we both did everything we could to win the match. But sometimes you cannot get an interesting game. Like Game 5 where I had this novelty in the Sveshnikov and equalized. My assessment of the match was that when both the players are relying on surprises with Black and have an extra halfyear to prepare it is very diffi cult for the player with White to get an advantage in the first few games. Exactly! Actually this was a sort of revelation to me during the match. Before it I could not imagine that it would be so difficult to get anything in the opening. Even though Anand played a side-line it was very difficult to get an advantage, because he had analysed it deeply with computers. You need to spend a comparable amount of time in a line to be able to create problems. Let us talk about the tie-breaks. It seems to me that the decisive factor was that Anand changed his openings and you did not? Probably!? I still have to revisit it to make up my mind. But also, if your opening has served you well? You can play something you have not analysed deeply, but when Anand played l .e4 in the match, he was ready to meet all kinds of openings. So I relied on the openings I knew better. I could have played another opening, for example the Najdorf, and got trapped there. I had to
276 Positional Decision Making in Chess
make a choice and all choices had advantages and drawbacks. So I chose as I did. But even the way it came I had my chances. Of course I had to spend too much time in Game 2 finding an antidote to this interesting idea - 1 1 .tlla5! - which we had not predicted in our preparation. But in Monaco I managed to win far more complicated rook endings and hold far more difficult endgames than Game 2, also playing with increments of 1 0 seconds. I was surprised in Game 2 that you did not give up your bishop for the pawn in order to defend rook against rook and knight. Somehow I could not see a way to get it. I was also hesitating; should I look for it or should I make a fortress? I really spent too much time hesitating. I should have made up my mind more decisively. Could I really have forced this endgame? Yes, a Jew times. But a few times I could also have created a fortress. I would think that a harmless theoretical position would be a better choice than a fortress, which you need to understand But a theoretical position, you just know. Exactly! But you know, I would make a draw eight or nine times out of ten from this position. But this time it did not happen. And Game 3 I would probably win 999 from 1 OOO, but still this did not happen. In Game 4 I also had the advantage, but I should have played more patiently, advancing on both flanks and maybe it would have been enough to win the game. What were you actually thinking when you played :gh7?
[diagram]
[The game went 59.gh7?? i>d6 60.i>g3 i>e6 1h-1/2. 59.�g3 just wins.] Appendix - I Cannot Leave My House! It is hard to explain. I have studied rook endings all my life. At age nine I knew the theory of the ending with 3 vs. 3 plus a pawn on the queenside. I knew all the ideas. And when I was twelve I studied Levenfish & Smyslov's and Minev's books and others very deeply, so I cannot say that I am not familiar with rook endings. I know a lot about it as well as the Vancura position [black king on b7, rook on c6, checking the white king perpetually] , which he obviously cannot get here. Probably I had some black-out, believing that he would get the Vancura position after 'kt>g3. I don't know. Rook endings give me a lot of pleasure. Recently there was a brilliant article in the Russian magazine 64 by Ilya Odessky with some really deep ideas, which I studied for days. In one of my training sessions before the match I spent a full day just trying to understand what was going on to increase my understanding of rook endgames. Even before the match I took care of my rook endgame knowledge, but what happened here has nothing to do with rook endings. I was thinking it was just nerves. No; you could not imagine how calm I was. And probably this was the problem - I was too calm. I really do not know. For me it is a bit disappointing that the match was lost in a rook ending, which I studied and enjoy so much. It seemed that after you lost the tie-break you were very emotional and very disappointed? Well, of course I was disappointed. I felt that I had played a great match, so of course it was disappointing to lose it in this way. But I realized that anything could happen. You need to be ready for anything when you play the World Championship. I have a tricky question: what mattered most to you, to become World Champion or to play the match? This is actually a good question. Probably it interested me more to play the match and this was a problem. When I was ten years old a journalist came to the chess club where I studied. He asked us all what our dreams were. I remember it like it happened just now. One guy said he wanted to become a National Master and one guy said he wanted to be a Grandmaster. And they both succeeded. But I answered that I just wanted to keep on enjoying playing chess and I still enjoy it. So maybe this is a disadvantage. Some say that to become World Champion you have to have an obsessive desire to become so. But I am not obsessed with titles. The biggest challenge was to try to defeat the World Champion in a match. I really did not care if I would get the title or not. The only issue is that if I got the title there would be another great match two years down the road. I want to say that the last few months have been the most interesting in my life. And now I will have to win London 20 1 3 to get another match. And you are going to do this? I hope so, I will start preparing pretty soon.

In his efforts to explain his way of thinking, Boris Gelfand focuses on such topics as the squeeze, space advantage, the transformation of pawn structures and the transformation of advantages. Based on examples from his own games and those of his hero, Akiba Rubinstein, Gelfand explains how he thinks during the game. Grandmaster Boris Gelfand won the European Junior Championship in 1 987 and reached No. 3 in the World in 1 990. He has led the Israeli team to numerous medals at both European and Olympiad level. Gelfand won the 2009 World Cup and has participated in six Candidates cycles, winning it in 2011. He lost the 201 2 World Championship match in the play-off. At 46 he is still winning tournaments ahead of the best players in the world, in many cases men half his own age. Grandmaster Jacob Aagaard is the only chess author to have won all the major awards for chess writing. €24.99 $29.95
