The objective of the book is purely practical: to help the reader to improve his skills within chess strategy. It does not pretend to fulfil any scientific, historic or artistic functions. Thanks to my students and ex-students in Chile and Ecuador, whose feedback during classes certainly enriched this material. Also thanks to Alexandra and Nico for your patience while I was writing the book. Johan Hellsten, Riobamba, September 2010 Introduction Here I would like to comment brief ly on some general aspects of this book. Contents This book touches a wide range of subjects related to middlegame strategy. Each subject comes with some explanatory examples, and in the second half of the book you will find related exercises. I am a strong supporter of the intensive use of exercises in the learning process. In my opinion, the closer you can get to a game situation when you are training (or teaching) chess, the faster progress can be expected. In his excellent work Logika Sovremermyh Shahmat (Modern Chess Logic), Belarusian writer and grandmaster Viacheslav Dydyshko mentions that one major problem faced by chess students is that the theoretical knowledge acquired from literature remains "alien" to us for a long time. In the heat of the battle we will probably rely on what our intuition tells us and, unfortunately, that doesn't always coincide with our knowledge. Advancing his thoughts a little further, it is one thing to read through and understand a couple of Rubinstein's rook endgames, and quite another one to be able to play them like him! Naturally, any new chess knowledge has to be integrated in our mind with such depth that we are able to swiftly apply it in practice, even if a long time has passed since the learning moment. School kids often memorize a lot of facts before an exam, and forget most of it within a few weeks. (I, for one, would not like to repeat today my French or Maths exams from 1990.) In contrast, chess players need to store the information fora long time, and retrieve it without much delay. In this context I believe that exercises, alongside normal games and their posterior analysis, are one of the best tools. Compare the case of learning languages: few persons are able to speak a new language confidently after just reading through a few text and grammar books. What most of us need is practice, practice... Style and level I have tried to explain in the most didactical way possible what is actually happening on the board, without an excessive use of analysis, in order not to tire the reader. To experienced players some parts of the book will appear rather basic; and to others, more challenging. Club players will probably see a lot of things for the first time. Material There have been many different sources involved in the writing of this book, the most significant ones being Chess Informant, ChessBase Megabase and Chess Today. I have used a lot of my own games and fragments, simply because these are the games that I know best. Technology I used Chess Assistant 8.1 for the elaboration of this book, with Rybka 2.4 as the main analysis engine, and Megabase 2008 as a main reference database. How to read this book? It makes sense to start with the first, short chapter since it touches upon several concepts that will be present during the rest of the book. In contrast, the rest of the chapters are rather independent, although I often make references to earlier examples. Each chapter is divided into several sections, which can be treated in the following, simple way: 1. Go through the explanatory examples; 2. Solve the related exercises; 3. Compareyour solutions with the ones in the book. Advice for trainers It is easy to use this book as training material. Choose the section(s) that you need, go through the explanatory examples with your students, and then let them work with the related exercises. In practical terms, I suggest you always have the exercise positions arranged on chessboards. The time needed oscillates roughly between 5 and 20 minutes, depending on the exercise (they are presented in ascending order of difficulty) and the level of the student. The solutions can be presented in written form, or played out against the trainer, which creates a closer feeling for them. Please note that the solutions given in the book are not absolute truths - the important thing is to grasp the general strategical idea in each exercise. One additional piece of advice: many of the explanatory examples, as well as some of the longer exercises, can easily be used as "quiz" games, where the students should find the best move at determined (for example, five) moments during the game, with the trainer awarding the corresponding points and giving hints if necessary. Chapter One Basic Concepts of Strategy Introduction The middlegame is perhaps the most demanding phase of the game, where the player is constantly faced with tactical and strategical challenges. Without doubt, tactical capacity is fundamental in order to conduct the direct battle on the board, creating and evading threats, etc. However, we also need some basic notion about what things are beneficial for us in the long run. In his great work Strategic, famous chess trainer Mark Dvoretsky outlined a range of concepts and related definitions, which, with some slight modifications, conform the theoretical basis of this chapter. A review of the concepts Basically, any action undertaken in the game can be abstracted to tactical and strategical operations. The tactical ones are easy to grasp: direct threats, pins, forks, deflection, etc. As for the strategical ones, we can distinguish between: a) improving our pieces; b) pawn play; c) exchanges; d) prophylaxis (with restriction and provocation). The remainder of this book is structured around these subjects; for now let's just see a few related examples in practice. Example 1 V.ChuchelovKir.Georgiev Mainz (rapid) 2002 Improving our pieces At first sight, White seems to be clearly better. All his pieces are active, the opponent has a weakness on a6, and the queenside pawn majority is an asset in any endgame. On top of this, the black forces are obstructed by the badly placed knight on e8. 21...g6! Simple, yet very strong. Georgiev plans...£ig7-f5 in order to improve his knight. 22 £fl A good square for the bishop, where it protects g2 and keeps watching the a6pawn. In the event of 22 JlgS, fighting for the dark squares. Black could adjust his plans slightly by 22..JLg7 preparing...£rf6, and the knight reaches a decent square anyway. Another, more enterprising option is 22....h81? keeping intact the plan of... g7-f5. 22...6.7 23 ® e3?! A strange tempo loss. The immediate 23 Wh3 seemed more natural, although after 23..£rf5 Black hardly has any problems anymore. 23...£>f5 24 Wh3 Sfd8 In just four moves, the situation on the board has changed noticeably. Thanks to his strong central control Black already holds the upper hand. 25Sd3 The simple 25 2xd8+ 2xd8 26 Sdl might have been preferable. Now Black gains space, with tempo. 25...e5l 26 £d2 e4 27 Sxd8+ 5xd8 28 £f4 hS A sensible move in order to back up the well-placed knight, which also has an enticing destiny on d4- Black went on to win the game. This is a simple example of how to improve one of our pieces and the possible virtues of such an operation, especially if it is our worst piece that is being improved! Example 2 Cu.Hansen-J.Hellsten Malmo 1996 Pawn play Black just needs a few moves like...fid8,..JLg7 and...O-O to achieve safety. However, it is White to move and he manages to alter the pawn structure to his benefit. 15d5l This advance has several virtues: it gets rid of the backward d4-pawn, destroys Black's protected square at d5, and, most importantly, creates a mobile pawn majority on the queenside. Basic Concepts of Strategy 15...cxd5 After 15...fid8? 16 d6 the protected passed pawn is decisive in the long run. Even worse is 15-. xc5? 16.xc5 Wxc5 17 fiel+ with the idea of l~/...fLe7 18 d6. 16 xd5 Wd7 Exchanges won't remedy Black's structural problems, but after 16...Hd8 17 C4, followed by b2-b4 and a2-a4, White has a huge advantage. 17 Sadi Wxd5 18 Sxd5 £e7 Example 3 A.Khalifman-M.Adams Groningen 1990 19 b4! White's plan is simple: convert the majority into a passed pawn. Black is unable to do the same thing on the kingside, due to the doubled f-pawns. 19-Sc8 2OHfdlSc7 21&d2l The knight is heading for the comfortable c4-square. 21...f5 22 Sk4 O-O By playing 22...f4?! 23 -&d4 Black would just help the opponent in improving his pieces. 23 g3 &g7 24 &g2 Sd8 25 2xd8 £.xd8 26 a4l (D) Little by little White continues with his plan, whereas Black lacks counterplay. Hansen later won the game by bringing up his king. Evidently, the key to his success was 15 d51, improving the pawn structure. Exchanges The last move was 22 £}d2-e4 with the idea of swapping the strong enemy knight on c5. 22...£f5! The most tempting reply, and the best one as well! Black prepares to exchange his bishop for the white knight, so that his own, powerful knight will remain on the board. 23 Sc4 b3 24#cl By unpinning the knight White managed to avoid any tactical surprises; however, the opponent's reply will leave him with a clear strategical inferiority. 24...Axe4l 25 £xe4 f5 26 Ag2 Wa5 By now the virtues of the...JLf5xe4 plan are easy to grasp. The firmly installed knight outshines the passive bishop, and the b2-pawn is a burden in the long run. 27 h4 Wb5 28 Wc3 a4! A typical method in superior positions: Black forces the exchange of queens in order to limit the opponent's counterplay. 29 Wb4 Wxb4 30 Sxb4 Sfb8! Of course not 30...£>xb2? 31 Sxb3, and Black loses his target. Generally speaking, the attacker shouldn't exchange pawns unless there is a good reason for it. 31 Sxb8+Sxb8 The previous exchanges have emphasized White's problem with the b2-pawn. 32 Hbl Hc8 33 £h3 g6 34 e4 Sc2 35 Sal ®C5! The knight returns to its preferred square, where it eyes the e4-pawn. In contrast, 35... xb2?l 36 Ha8+ ->g7 37 Sb8 would have complicated Black's task. White lost on time in a desperate position; for example, 40 Sa7+ &d8 41 £f7 Sc2 42.SLxg6 e41 wins. In conclusion, the exchange operation initiated by 22...jLf5 helped Black to reach a superior position of the "good knight vs. bad bishop" type, while the subsequent exchanges of major pieces proved useful in order to increase the advantage. Example 4 E.Lobron-R.Dautov Nussloch 1996 Prophylaxis, restriction and provocation White has just played 27 Sd2-e2, with the probable intention of Sfel creating a mating threat. 27...g6! A typical prophylactic measure. With...tegl next. Black safeguards the king from any surprises along the back rank. Moreover, he takes the f5 and hs squares from the white queen and knight. 28 Sfel &g7 All of a sudden White has fallen short of active plans, whereas Black is waiting for the right moment to attack the b2-pawn. 36 exf5 Sxb2 37 fxg6 Or 37 Sa8+ &g7 38 Sa7+ &f6 39 fxg6 xgfe and the passed pawn decides - Adams. 37...hxg6 38 £e6+ &f8 39 Sa8+ &e7 Basic Concepts of Strategy 29 2>g2 h5! By setting up the positional threat of...h5-h4. Black aims at provoking a weakness in the enemy camp. 30 h3 On the intended 30 £)e3 there could follow 3O...h4! with attacking prospects. However, 30 h4 seemed like a safer way of de-

against a potential...JLxh4 sacrifice. 30...fid6 31 4? The lesser evil was 31 e3, though after 31...C3 32 bxc3 Hxc3 33 Wa2 Wd7' (thanks to the provocation of h2-h3, Black gains a vital tempo) 34 &h2 Wa4 Black enjoys a clear advantage - Dautov. 31...flb6 32 flbl c31 33 b4 aS 34 He4 fid8! Now back to our revision of strategical concepts. Before leaving the strategical and tactical operations, the former of which we will return to soon, I would like to emphasize the link between tactics and strategy. Without using tactical weapons and preventing the opponent's tactical threats, we won't be able to conduct the strategical battle. Often a strategically superior position has to be realized in a concrete manner; i.e. at some moment we have to resort to tactics in order to impose our advantage. On other occasions, a tempting strategical plan can fail due to a simple tactical detail. Finally, by utilizing tactical resources in the

cific piece. Let's see an example that touches on several of these aspects. Example 5 N.Short-L.Ljubojevic Novi Sad Olympiad 1990 White managed to save the b-pawn, but now the second rank proves to be too vulnerable. 35 Abel axb4 36 axb4 fixb4 37 Uxb4 Wxb4 38 Se4 Wb2 39 He2 Sd2! White resigned. Evidently, the plan with...g7-g6 and...&g7 not only neutralized the back rank threats, but also prevented enemy ideas such as &h5 and Wf$. Another strong move was 29...h5 in order to provoke a weakening of White's kingside. These methods are indeed typical in practice. In this theoretical position Black aims at completing the queenside development by..JLd7-c6, after which he would have a solid game thanks to the strong knight on e5- Now let us see how Short fights against this plan with all possible tactical means. 18®d51 Supported by the line 18...exd5? 19 Wxd5+ sfch8 20 Hxf8 mate, White improves his knight, which was not doing anything substantial on c3. 18...Wd8 19 b6 Sb8 Again Black is just one move away from 20..Jld7, so White hurries to create threats. 22...£c5 23 Wd2Ha8 A new tactical twist that helps improve the bishop before grabbing the pawn. 24...'&h8 25 exd5 b5 26 a5i Preventing 26...Ab7. 26...£tf8 27 £.e5l With the strong threat of 28 Jlxg7+ <&xg7 29 Wc3+. 27... g6 28 £xg6 hxg6 29 b4 £.f8 30 d6 20£f4!£d7 After 2O...Jld7 21 &xd71 (21.fi.xe5 dxeS 22 Wxd7 Wxb6+ 23 &hl s hS! is less clear) 21... xd7 22.fi.g4 Black is suffering on the light squares; e.g. 22...We8 23 Wc4 or 22...e5 23 Wd5+&h8 24£e3. Probably 2O...£jc6 was preferable, when 21 Wf2 g6 22 -fi.e21? £g7 23 c3, intending.&.C4, keeps a pleasant edge for White. 21 £}c4l Strategically speaking, this is the desired move, since any exchange would help Black to liberate himself. However, before making it Short had to establish that neither 21...e5 nor 21.. d5 would work against him. 21...d5 Or 21...e5?l 22 Wd5+ &h8 23 &e3 with a huge edge. 22 sfchi! Parrying the threat of 22...&C5. It also transpires that 22...dxc4 loses the exchange after 23 Axb8. White has an enormous advantage and soon won the game. Please note that the bishop on c8 hasn't moved yet! It is less probable that White would have reached his main objective - prevention of Black's queenside development - without such a heavy use of tactical arms. Basic Concepts of Strategy Now we should move on with more concepts of strategy. Alongside the strategical operations we have positional elements such as material, weak squares, space, passed pawns, files, diagonals, etc. One important task during the game is to evaluate which of these elements hold most significance. Let's see an example. Example 6 I.Sokolov-J.Emms Hastings 1998/99 O.Jakobsen-Cu.Hansen, Torshavn 1997- Next Black could consider...,fi.f8 followed by...g7-g6 and...jLg7 improving the bishop, whereas White's doubled pawns are troublesome in the long run. 13...£lbd7 14 Wc2 d5? A tempting counter-strike directed at the king on el. However, it soon transpires that it is the black king who will suffer from the opening of lines. Considerable safer was 14...£rf8! 15 f5 hS 16 fxe6 fxe6 with just a slight advantage for White - Ftacnik. 15 f 51 exf5 16 Wxf5 dxc4 17.&XC4 Now it becomes evident that the a2-g8 diagonal is a much more relevant factor than the e-file, since the white king could hide on fl at any moment, whereas Black has no light-squared bishop that can challenge the enemy on C4. 17...g6 Definitely not 17..Jla3+? 18 &fl.xb2 19 £>d5; but 17...£rf81? again made sense, e.g. 18 fl Wc8! 19 Wd3 £>e6 and Black de-

[diagram]

More natural was 19..JLf8+ 20 &'f 1.g7, although at this point both 21 £)b5 and 21 £>d5 spell trouble for Black. 20 Ehl Wc7 21 s£>fi! Securing the king and preparing 22 Bel. From now on. White's attack plays itself. 21...Wd8 22 Bel Bf8 Parrying the threat of 23 £id5! £>xd5 24 Wxd5 with a deadly attack on f7. 23&a4! Setting up the threat of 24 -&.xd7. 23-..b5 24 Axb5 Bb8 25 £xd7 Wxd7 26 Bxe71 Wxe7 27 £xf6 We6 28 d5 Wa6+ 29 &g2 Bb6 30 2te4 In this desperate position, Black resigned. In conclusion. White's control of the a2-g8 diagonal and his active bishop pair were decisive factors in this game. In the above position both sides have their respective triumphs. White possesses the two bishops and more space, whereas Black has the superior pawn structure. 13 f41 Preparing f4-f5 in order to clear the position for the bishop pair. In such doubleedged positions, the player with weaknesses should act rapidly, before the opponent manages to consolidate. Let's see what can happen in the opposite case: 13 fi?! £)bd7 14 -£e3?l £jf8! 15 f4 £>g6 (thanks to the previous manoeuvre, the black king now feels safer, whereas the knight has interesting destinies on h4-f5) 16 d5 Wc8 17 Eg3 £>h4 18 " gl #tf5 with excellent play. 23...Ad8! Wisely enough. Black prevents the enemy plan. A light-hearted reply like 23...flfd8? permits 24 h41, when 24...£>xh4? 25 Hxg7+! xg7 26 Wf6+ followed by 27 J&_h6(+) is terminal for Black. On the other hand, an active defence with 23...f6? would have failed to 24 Hxg6! hxg6 (or 24-..fxe5 25 Wh4 transposing) 25.xg6 fxe5 26 Wh4 with a decisive attack. In effect, White's attack was stopped by the accurate 23....d8, so what should he do now? 24 g51 The beginning of a new plan: swap the dark-squared bishops and transfer the knight to the outpost on d6. 24..Jfc.xg5 Possibly a better choice was 24...f6 25 exf6.xf6 in order to put an end to the enemy plan, although after 26 We3 Sdf7 27 &e4 White keeps the initiative. 25 Hxg5 Wd8 Before doubling rooks on the d-file, Andersson brings the queen closer to the kingside. 26 We3 We7 27 e4 b6 The immediate 27-.Sfd8 gives White the additional option of 28 &c5l? with an even stronger plan: swap on e6 and attack with the bishop along the a2-g8 diagonal. After 28...6.7 29 <?jxe6 Wxe6 30.b3 We7 31 Sfl, followed by 32 Hgf5, Black is in trouble. 28 Sfl By keeping the knight on e4 for one more move, Sokolov maintains the option of £)f6+. 28...fifd8 If 28...JLd5, with the idea of 29 £)xd6?? Hxd6, then White could again deviate from his original plan with 29 £>g3l heading for f5- 29&d6 What about planning in chess? Well, this is quite a tricky matter since the opponent might put up obstacles to our plans at any moment. Only in very superior positions, with the opponent deprived of any activity, does a detailed plan make sense. In the majority of cases, we should rather concentrate on finding the appropriate strategical and tactical operations, and adjust these according to the opponent's play. Of course, this doesn't exclude keeping general directions at mind, such as "attack on the kingside", "advance the queenside pawn majority", or "exchange pieces". Let's see an example. Example 7 I.Sokolov-LLAndersson Reggio Emilia 1988/89 White has interesting attacking prospects thanks to his control of the semi-open f-file and the strong bishop on c2. With his next move Sokolov takes a first step in this direction. 23 Sg3l Preparing 24 h4 in order to expel the knight from g6. Obviously, the immediate 23 h4? would have failed to 23...JLg4. Basic Concepts of Strategy to case. For example, in the above fragment Short-Ljubojevic we came across a typical Sicilian position. The study of games that lead to typical positions is essential in order to learn openings properly, since it helps us to master the related plans in the middlegame, and acquire a "feeling" for the opening. Technique is a term used frequently when referring to the realization of an advantage without allowing the opponent any chances of counterplay. Furthermore, good technique is often related to the attention on small details in the position. By now we have arrived at two important concepts: initiative and dynamics. By initiative I refer to some kind of major influence on the battle, without necessarily being an advantage in itself. The side that possesses the initiative has a greater liberty when it comes to the choice of actions, whereas his opponent is mainly reduced to defensive tasks. Later on, the initiative can be converted into an advantage, or it can disappear. Let's see an example. Example 8 Y.Seirawan-G.Sosonko Bad Kissingen 1981 Mission accomplished. On d6 the knight not just controls a variety of key squares (such as f7 and f5), it also interferes with the opponent's main idea, an attack on the d4-pawn. If these circumstances are maintained, then White could start over again with the attack. 29...fixd6! This sacrifice is probably Black's best shot.

Not much better is 29...C5?! due to 30 dxc5 bxc5 31 Wg31 resuming the idea of h4-h5- At this point both 31. -h6 and 31...f6 permit a strong sacrifice on g6, while 31...Wf8 32 h4 £*xe5 33 £>e4! is equally decisive. 30 exd6 Hxd6 31 2g3 Thanks to his slight material edge and active pieces, White holds a stable edge. The next plan might be b2-b4, -&.e4 and flci in order to attack the weak c6-pawn. In this whole example we can notice the flexibility with which White executed his plans. Another important concept within chess strategy is the so-called typical positions. Here I am referring to those with a similar pawn structure and piece configuration, although the involved set-ups (the location of some of the pawns and pieces) may differ from case new threats. The materialistic 21 £id6+?! &c7 22 £>xf7 promises less due to 22...£.f6 23 Sh7 Hg81, followed by...Eg7, and the initiative starts to evaporate. 21...£.e8 Or 21..JLe6 22 2)c51.f5 23 e41 b6 24 exf5 bxc5 25 fxg6 fxg6 26 JLf3 with a considerable advantage despite the minus pawn. 22£g4+&c7 Obviously 22...f5?? failed to 23 £>d6+ with mate. 23 JLe6! &e7 24 £xf7 £xf7 25 Bxf7 &d7 26 Eg7 White is slightly better due to the badly placed black king that obstructs the rook on a8. He should now create some activity before Black manages to coordinate his forces. 13 h3l Seirawan prepares g4-g5 in order to gain space and access to the e4-square for his knight. Stereotypical play with 13 Ed2?l promises less after 13....f8 14.xf8 Hxf8 15 Ehdl!Xc7 16 Bd6 JLe6, followed by...Ead8, and Black has no major problems. 13...h5 Now after 13...Jtf8 14.xf8 Hxf8 15 g4.e6 16 g5 £>d7 17 Lg4l White obtains some advantage - Cvetkovic. White also gains the upper hand in the event of 13 - h6 14 g4.e6 15 J.d6! £te8 16 &e7 followed by £te4. With 13...h5 Black instead aims at preventing the g2-g4 advance, and would indeed succeed after the slow 14 Hhgi?! h4. However, White has a much stronger move, which allows him to seize the initiative. 14 g4l hxg4 15 hxg4 This pawn sacrifice is mainly based on the fact that the clearance of the h-file favours White, due to the disconnected black rooks. 15...Axg4 After 15...£>xg4 16 Exh8+.xh8 17 Ehl Jtf6 18 flh71 the black kingside comes understrong pressure. 16 Exh8+ ±xh8 17 £e7! Generally speaking, the side that possesses the initiative should play actively, creating new threats whenever possible. Here Black is faced with the double threat of 18 Ed8+ and 18.xf6. 17...6.7 18 Ehl &g7 19 £xf6! In order to keep up the pressure White needs to bring his knight into the game. The bishop pair matters less. 19...£xf6 20 e4 £d8 21 Eh7l Seizing the seventh rank and creating Finally White has managed to convert his initiative into something more tangible: a superior endgame. The knight outshines the bishop, the rook is well placed on g7, and Black has weak pawns on the g6- and e5-squares. 26...6.6 27 &dl! After 27 Exg6+?1 XTs 28 Bg7 X'xeA (not 28....a3+? 29 'Xd2 &xe4 30 Ef 71 intending mate) 29 Sxe7 Ef 8! Black gets some counterplay for the pawn. Seirawan prefers a more technical path, simply bringing up the king. 27.. Ef8 28 &e2 flf7 29 Eg8 Heading for b8 in order to provoke new weaknesses. White later won. Basic Concepts of Strategy Dynamics is another frequently used term in chess literature, and one that can be interpreted in different ways. I regard it as a force that changes the long-term characteristics of a position. This force is closely related to pawn play and exchanges, since these are the only irreversible actions in the game - after any pawn move or exchange, the position never becomes the same (compare the 50 moves rule). In concrete terms, pawn moves (some more than others) let new elements appear, such as open files, passed pawns and weak squares. In other words, dynamic play is the one that creates something "new" in the position. Let's see an example. which can soon be occupied by a knight. Moreover, the fact that the g6 and e5 squares are at a knight jump's distance is rather practical for White. 12...£f6 Black should probably avoid 12...£idf6?! due to 13 £ie5 followed by £ig6; however, the restrictive 12...We81? intending 13 £ih4? Wxh5 was worth consideration. 13 e3 Due to Black's previous move White must protect the d4-pawn before moving the knight towards g6. 13...3414. h4 b6 Black's play is logical as well. By attacking the c4-pawn he asks the opponent to define his centre, for example by 15 £ixe4 fxe4 16 c5, when 16...£kl7 followed by 17...He8 gets him closer to the desired...e6e5 advance. On the other hand, 15 b3 would clear the a-file for the black rook. However, there is a third, stronger option. 15 £xe4l Sasikiran swaps the rather passive bishop for the active enemy knight. Regarding his own knight on d2, its mission will be revealed two moves later. 15...fxe4 16 £ig6 He8 17 f 3l White adjusts the pawn structure so that the other knight gets into play. Moreover, he clears the bl-h7 diagonal for the queen. This key move had to be executed at this very moment - after, for example, 17 C5?l d7 18 f3 e5 1 Black takes over. 17...exf3 18 c5 &d7?! In a closed position such as this one, 18...f2+? 19 < >xf2 hardly makes any sense. But 18...&C4I? was a more active choice; e.g. 19 £ixf3 (avoiding 19 £ixc4 dxc4 20 Wxc4 b6! with counterplay) 19-b6 20 b3 axb3 21 axb3 &a5 and Black has far more play than in the game. 19 £ixf3 b6 20 cxb6 4dxb6 21 O-Ol Example 9 K.Sasikiran-A.Iljushin FIDE World Cup, Khanty Mansiysk 2005 In this structure known as the Stonewall, Black deliberately leaves a weak square on e5, but in return gains control of the light squares, in particular e4. 12 h5l A useful pawn advance that prevents...g7-g5 and creates a weak square on g6. White avoids 21 Wxc6?l.fi.d7 followed by...£)C4 with counterplay. 21-.fi.a6 22 Bf2 £b5 23 £)fe5 A last aspect of strategy is the rhythm of the position. Imagine that one player possesses a far advanced passed pawn, or a strong attack. In such positions the play tends to become sharp and tactically complex, where one single slip might lead to defeat. We saw an example in 5okolov- Emms above. Conversely, in more balanced

[diagram]

game becomes slower, with both players carefully choosing between different strategical operations, evaluating what are the most important elements in the position, etc. In conclusion, our way of playing has to be in accordance with the rhythm of the position - we shouldn't lose our patience in the slow ones, nor neglect the dangers and complexities of the quicker ones. Finally, I would like to show you one of my own games, in which many of the preceding concepts are reflected. Example 10 J.Hellsten-M.Olesen Malmo 1997 Benoni Defence (A43) 1 d4 e6 2 c4 C5 3 d5 exd5 4 cxds d6 5 #k3 £)e7 With 5...£>f6, followed by 6...g6 and 7-.fi.g7, Black would have entered the main pathways of the Benoni Defence. 6 £if3 £ g6 The set-up with...£)g6 has its pros and cons, compared to the mainstream Benoni. Black increases his control of the important e5-square, thus complicating one of White's key ideas in this opening, the e4-e5 advance. On the other hand, the dark- White has achieved his main objective: a grip on e5. 23...£>C4 24£)g4l By means of the threat 25 JLxh6, Sasikiran forces the black bishop to g5 where it can be exchanged. 24.-fi.g5 25 £)6e5 £>xe5 26 £>xe5 Wf6 27 &h2l Hac8 28 £xg5 Wxg5 29 Wg6! With every exchange, the knight's superiority over the bishop is more evident. 29...Wxg6 After 29-Wxe3? 30 Xtf7 Black is mated. We now appreciate the merits of the prophylactic 27 lfc, h2!. 30 hxg6! A dynamic recapture that creates an entry square on f7 and also enables a future g4-g5, clearing the h-file. 30...fle7 31 Scc2 Ef8 At this point Sasikiran played 32 g4 followed by &g3 and won without any major problems. However, the consequent 32 Hf7! seems even stronger; eg. 32-Sexf7 33 gxf7+ Oxf7 (or 33—&h7? 34 Hf2 with the threat of 35 &d7) 34 £>xf7 xf7 35 Hc31 followed by b2-b3, creating a decisive passed pawn on the a-file. Basic Concepts of Strategy squared bishop is deployed less actively on e7. 12...C4 13 £}d4 and White gains the upper hand. The paradoxical H„.iLf5!? makes more sense: after 12 e4 -fi.d7 Black has managed to provoke e2-e4, which means that White can no longer use the e4-square for his pieces, whereas the e4-pawn might soon turn into a target for the enemy forces, after moves like...Be8 and...±f6. There is also ll...Hc8, getting on with development and complicating the b2-b4 advance. Z.Gyimesi-L.Seres, Balatonbereny 1997, continued 12.d2 He8! (avoiding 12.Jlf6 13 <be4) 13 b4 cxb4 14 axb4 £.f6 with a comfortable game for Black. Perhaps White could try the odd 13 h4l? instead, intending £}g5 as well as h4-h5- 12 £e3 Heading for the promising d4-square and preparing to meet 12...£)c5?l with 13.&.XC5 dxc5 14 d6. 12...Wa5 Black develops the queen and strengthens the c5-square. 13 £d4 Efc8 Black continues with preparatory actions, aware that 13...&C5?! is still premature due to 14 £>d2 intending 14...b5 15 £.xc5 dxc5 16 d6. 14&d2 b5 7g3 7 e4 is perfectly possible, but the fianchetto has its logic too. The g3-pawn takes the h4 and f4 squares from the enemyknight, whereas the e4-square remains accessible for a white knight, an idea that might come handy if Black later moves the bishop to f6. 7...Ae7 8 £g2 O-O 9 O-O £>a6 Black initiates a standard plan in this structure:...b7-b5, advancing the queenside pawn majority. 10 a3 White resorts to another typical plan in the Benoni: 11 Ebl and 12 b4, gaining space and preventing...b5-b4. Another, perhaps more promising option is 10 £}d2, followed by a2-a4 and #}c4, in order to improve the king's knight. 10...6.7 llfiblc4 Thus Black prepares...£>c5 and also neutralizes the b2-b4 advance, since 12 b4?l is now met by 12...cxb3 ensuring the c5square for the knight. On the minus side, the c-pawn becomes a little loose, and White gains access to the d4-square. let's check Black's other options. On 11...b5?l there follows 12 b4 intending Finally Black is ready to go 1$...£ic5. He would then retreat the queen to d8 in preparation for a queenside advance with...a7-a5 and...b5-b4. How should White react to this plan? 15 f4! A powerful thrust that creates new opportunities on the kingside. White now threatens f5-f6 in order to soften up the f6square, while e4-e5, seizing the centre, might also come into consideration. 15 e4?l is less flexible due to 15... c5 16 f4 <£d3 with counterplay, but 15 b41? also made sense, with a fight for the queenside. After 15...cxb3 (not 15...Wxa3? 16 Sal Wxb4 17 Sxa6 etc) 16 xb3 Wd8! followed by..Jlf 6, there are chances for both sides. 15..J6 Preventing the f5-f6 plan once and for all, at the cost of weakening the light squares and restricting the bishop on e7. However, the alternatives all lead to trouble for Black: a) 15...f5?l invites 16 e4l intending £.h3, with excellent attacking prospects. b) 15...Wd8, covering the f6-square, is well met by 16 f5 £ie5 (or 16... f8 17 f6!.SLxf6 18 Exf6! gxf6 19 £>de4 with a strong attack) 17 £xe5 dxe5 18 de4 with a clear edge. The e4-square is ideal for the knight, from where it limits Black's counterplay and supports a future d5-d6 or f5-f6. c) 15...£ic5 is the move that Black would like to make, but this runs into the strong continuation 16 f5 £ie5 (i6... f8 again fails to 17 f6!) 17.fi.xe5 dxe5 18 d6! £g5 (or 18...£xd6? 19 £xa8 Exa8 20 2>xc41 bxc4 21 Wxd6 winning) 19 -fi.xa8 Exa8 20 £tf3 -fi.e3+ 21 S&g2. White isn't just an exchange up, he also has a dangerous passed pawn, along with several strong threats such as 22 2>xe5, 22 2>d5 and 22 Wd5. After 15.-f6 White has to forget about a direct kingside attack and, instead, focus on the new weaknesses in Black's camp. As a consequence, the game slows down and becomes strategically more complex. 16 &hl A prophylactic measure in conjunction to my next move, which will expose the gla7 diagonal. 16...&C5 Finally the knight reaches its destiny. The ambitious 16....d8, intending,...b6, fails to 17 b4! forcing the queen to retreat. 17 -&XC5! It might appear illogical to swap the "good" bishop, but this exchange has several virtues. White gets rid of the opponent's most active piece, the knight on c5. Moreover, after...f7-f6 has been played, the d4-square is in fact more useful to a knight, where it can access the weaknesses on c6, e6 and f5. Finally, if we imagine a later exchange of the light-squared bishops, as well as of a pair of knights, then White would reach a "good knight vs. bad bishop" scenario. We already came across this topic in the 5asikiran-lljushin fragment (p. 23). 17...Exc5 18 2)f3 Wb6 19 2)d4 White now enjoys a pleasant edge thanks to his light square control. In retrospect, please note that he would probably not have reached such a favourable situation without Basic Concepts of Strategy 27 £a2! Improving the knight in the swiftest way. Now that 27- a5 is unavailable (for this reason, 26...Wb6 was preferable). Black can't stop the £>b4-c6 manoeuvre. 27...£e7 28 2)b4 Ha8 29 £)bc6 £d8 30 Wg2 £b6? Black should have exchanged one of the powerful knights by 3O...£le7, even though after 31 £}xe7+ Wxe7 32 Wh3 White keeps a clear advantage. In the game the bishop soon proves to be useless on b6 anyway. 31Stf5 &f8 playing 15 f4, whose tactical potential (cf. the 15...&C5 subline) convinced Black to weaken his structure by 15...f6. Again, tactics at the service of strategy. 19-fie8?! 19. a5 was preferable, speeding up the queenside play, although after 20 Le4 b4 21 £te4 JLxa4 22 Wxa4 White keeps the better chances. 20 £e4! Intending 21.&.f5 in order to swap the opponents "good" bishop. 20..JIcc8 21 £xf5 22 £>xf5 Af8? Again Black should have resorted to 22...a$ with the idea of...b5-b4. As a general piece of advice, in inferior positions one should hurry to create even the most minimal counterplay. 32g4l White can finally convert his positional advantage into a direct king side attack. 32.J e6? Desperation, but it was already too late for a satisfactory defence; e.g. 32...h6 33 gS breaking through, or 32...g6 33 £ih6+ followed by 34 g 5 and possibly 35 e5 with a crushing attack. 33 g5 fxg5 34 dxe6 Wxc6 35 Wxg5 g6 Both 35 Wb7 and 35...Ha 7 are met by 36 e7 renewing the threats. 36 Wf6l gxf5 37 Hgl+ -2-xgl 38 Exgl mate In the following chapters we will continue the revision of these strategical concepts. 23 d4! The knight returns to its ideal square and restricts Black's only active plan:...a7a5 followed by...b5-b4. 23...a6 24 e4 Hb8 25 Wd2 Wb7 26 Ebel White has strengthened his centre, in particular the d5-pawn, which means that the knight on c3 can now look for new horizons. 26...Wd7?! Black underestimates, or misses. White's next move. Chapter Two Improving the Pieces In this chapter we will study in more detail how to improve our pieces. On several occasions we will observe the cooperation between two or more pieces, for example rook and queen or the bishop pair. ops. In the diagram position White is about to develop his remaining bishop. Ideas like 12 JlgS. or perhaps 12 f3 followed by JLe3, come to mind. However, there is another, more powerful diagonal. The bishop In all phases of the game, we should constantly search for ideal diagonals for our bishops. Since the bishop is able to move rapidly from one flank to another, its range can be drastically improved in a few moves. We will start with some examples where one player seizes one of the long diagonals. The fact that these cross the whole board turns out to be more important than one might perhaps initially think. 12 b3! Intending Jlb2 in order to seize the long diagonal, which is of great importance when there are no central pawns on it. 12..JXfe8 If Black tries to challenge the enemy bishop by 12...£ig4 preparing..JLf6, then White has 13 £>ds! c6 14 -&.b2 with strong Example 11 A.Bujakevich-LKritz Moscow 1996 Already in the opening we are faced with the choice of diagonals for our bish- Improving the Pieces pressure. A more careful way of launching the previous plan is 12...C6!? 13 ii.b2 £)e8. Here White could try 14 Sadi e6 (not 14...£.f6? 15 e51) 15 Sfel &f6 16 Wd2 with a slight edge, although Black probably has less trouble than in the game. 13 &b2 &f8 tion. The immediate threat is 21 g5 trapping the knight. 2O...h6 21 Bgl Preparing g4-g5, with a strong attack. Evidently, the bishop is well placed for this purpose on b2. Not surprisingly, there are entire opening systems based on the deployment of a bishop on the long diagonal, such as the Catalan and the Grunfeld. Example 12 Z.Efimenko-V.Neverov Ukrainian Championship, Rivne 14 Radi White slowly reinforces his position, aware that the opponent can't undertake any active measures, e.g. 14...g6? 15 ®d5l. 14...Wc6 15 St el a6 16 f 3 fiad8 After 16...b5?l 17 £>d51 xd5 18 cxd5 followed by Rd, Black ends up with a bad structure. 17 &hl Wd7 18 £>e2 He6 19 2ee8 20 g4! In open positions with pawns on both flanks the bishop tends to outshine the knight. Here White also commands the open d-file, and the black queenside pawns are weak. How to progress? 3O.te2! The bishop is regrouped to the long diagonal, where it will control more squares. 3O...Sc6 Heading for c7 in order to protect the seventh rank. In the event of 3O...£tf6, intending 31 &f3 Sb4, White has 31 a51 Sb4 32 d6 with strong pressure on the a6- Finally White is ready for concrete ac- pawn. 31We5 No hurry. Efimenko lets his bishop glance at the a6-pawn for one more move, while improving the queen. 31... f6 32 £f3 Hc7 33 Sd6! Activating the rook and creating the threat of 34 Sxa6. 33...6d7 34 ®C3 c4 Now there arises a strong passed pawn; however.

Moreover, his own pawns on e4 and f3 restrict the enemy pieces. How should he move on? 27 b3! Gligoric prepares the transfer of his dark-squared bishop to the long diagonal, where it will become quite strong in the absence of a black f-pawn. 27...1fd8 28 jtcl Wf8 After 28...e5?l 29.b2 the pawn becomes exposed on e5. A more aggressive option is 28...£>h51? intending 29 _fi.b2?l Wg5l with counterplay. White could try 29 $Le2 instead, in order to swap rooks before continuing his plan. 29 £b2 h6 30 &g2 2>g8 31 2)e5!

Passed pawns should advance, as the old saying goes. Instead, the game continued 39 Wc61? Wd8 40 Wa8! Wxa8 41 £xa8 with a very superior endgame that Efimenko went on to win without any problems. But the advance with the b-pawn wins practically on the spot. 39...axb5 40 axb5 Wd7 One of several insufficient ways of fighting against the passed pawn. 41 Wb8+$h7 42 b6 There will inevitably follow 43 b7, with an easy win. Improving the Pieces clear advantage due to his active pieces, so Black tries to complicate the game. 34 Well Gligoric has noticed that is worth the exchange to launch a strong attack.

However, Portisch now initiates active measures in which his light-squared bishop will play a crucial role. 7...b6l Considering that White is eager to play c2<3 to secure his king on c2, Black hurries to put the bishop on the fl-a6 diagonal, where it will touch the key square on d3- 8c3?l After seeing the game, you will probably 17 a4 ce5 18 £ixeS #}xe5 19 £.e2 h4 20 g4 Improving the Pieces Or 20 ZXhl hxg3! 21 Hxh8 g2 22 Hg8 £ig6 23 £tf3.xe4+ and wins - Portisch. 20... h3 21 f3 h2 22 Shi Sh3 Intending...&.h6, with devastating pressure on White's camp.

Can you spot Kramnik's strong bishop manoeuvre? 23 Wcl! Preparing JLdi-b3 in order to seize the a2-g8 diagonal. This would transform the passive bishop on f3 into a terrific piece now that Black has no light-squared counterpart. 23 Wbi?l is less accurate due to 23..£k4 attacking the other bishop. 23...WC4 Gelfand searches for relief in a queen exchange. 23 - c4? no longer worked due to 24 -dl followed by 25.b3; while 23-..a5 24 -dl a4, taking the b3-square from the bishop, can be met by 25 Ubi Hfb8 26 Ae21? si?h7 (the threat was 27 Hxb6) 27 1 c2 followed by 28 Sedi with strong pressure. White maintains strong pressure for the pawn, although Gelfand eventually drew. Now let's see a complete game where White's light-squared bishop did the main part of the work. Example 19 J.Hellsten-A.Brkljaca Belgrade 2002 Nimzo-lndian Defence (E46) 1 d4 *£f6 2 C4 e6 3 4 c3 £b4 4 e3 O-O 5 4 ge2 d5 6a3£e7 7&f4 This is a modest, yet fully playable version of the Rubinstein Variation in the Nimzo-lndian, in which White gives priority to a swift development.

Now, on the other hand, the white queen keeps tying its counterpart to the b7-pawn and there appears the threat of 19 a5- 18...a5? A strategical mistake that creates a weak square on b5 and makes the queenside pawn majority less mobile. Black should have preferred the pragmatic 18...JLe6! 19.xe6 (or 19.bi?! £)c4 with counterplay) 19...fxe6 with just a minimal disadvantage due to the weakness on e6. 19 e4£e6 20.fi.bl!

So far we have mainly been dealing with open diagonals. In the following examples, we will examine a few different methods of clearing a key diagonal for our bishops. Example 20 M.Vokac-D.Navara Czech Championship, Karlovy Vary 2005 In a typical Sicilian battle a piece exchange on d3 deprived White of the bishop pair but also strengthened his centre. Next he would like to attack on the kingside by Wg3, f4-f5 etc. 17...d5l A standard advance that softens up the long diagonal for the bishop. Black could also consider 17—f5l? in the same spirit; for example, 18 £ig3 fxe4 19 £id41? -&f6! 20 28 £f 51 Now the bishop aims for the protected square on e6 and also puts some pressure along the h3-c8 diagonal. 28...

After 18 e5 White plans to put a knight on d4 in order to block the bishop on b7, and then resume the kingside attack with f4-f5. However, when playing I7...d5 Navara had already defined his next, powerful move. the line 26 Wc21? £.b6 27 e2! £.xc5 28 £)C3 xb2 29 Wxb2.e31 30 <de2 Hc8 with a clear initiative. 26„.Wxe2 27 £ixe2 £b6 28 Ec3 Ed8 Despite the minus pawn Black has the better chances in this endgame, thanks to his bishops. The game saw 29 h3 h6 30 &h2 &f7 31 &g3 Ed7 32 d4?l.£dS 33 £.e3 aS! (opening a second front) 34 bxaS -£xaS 35 Ecl &c4 followed by....&b6, pressuring d4. Navara went on to win after a long battle. Example 21 S.Krivoshey-G.Timoshenko Kiev 2001 18...d4l This pawn sacrifice turns the bishop on b7 into a giant, and also creates a protected square on dS- 19 £iexd4 £ic6 It was time for the passive knight to enter the game. Less appropriate is 19-WdS?! 20 f 5! with an attack. 20£b2 Now after 20 fS £>xd4 21 £ixd4 -&.h41 22 Wd2.gS, followed by Wd$, it is Black who ends up attacking. 20...£ixd4 21 (bxd4 d5 22 We2 f 5!

White also puts some indirect pressure on e4, which explains Black's next move. 30...d5 Or 3O...fxg4?l 31 H.xf6! gxf6 32 £>xg4 with a clear advantage thanks to Black's numerous weaknesses - Krivoshey. 31 cxdS i.xd5 This drops a pawn, but after 31-. bxd5 32 Wg3 fxg4 (parrying the threat of 33 gS) 33 £sxg4 White's kingside pressure is unbearable. 32 gxf5 £.b3 33 Eel c4 34 Cjg4l Again unblocking the long diagonal for the bishop. 34...2.xg4 35 Wxg4Ed8 36&hl! White avoids the removal of his bishop after 36 f6?! Exf6! 37.&xf6 xfG and instead prepares 37 Egl with increased pressure. 36...®c5 37 f 6 37 figi! was even simpler, but the text doesn't ruin anything. 37...£>d5 38,£d4 Wxb5 39 fxg7 With a clear extra pawn and a strong attack, White won without major difficulties. Example 22 A.Istratescu-V.Buturin Bucharest 1992 White is a pawn up, but how can he progress? 24 g4l Istratescu prepares 25 f5 in order to soften up the a2-g8 diagonal for his bishop. This plan goes very well with the position of the white king, who won't get exposed by the pawn advances, nor obstruct a future kingside attack. 24...Ebc8 25 f 5! exf5 26 gxf5 &g7 After 26...Wxf5 27 xa4 the three passed pawns will become extremely powerful in any endgame. As for the middlegame, White may consider an attack down the f-file. 27 fxg6 hxg6 28 Ef3 Sc5 29 Hgl The straightforward 29 Wf21? seemed even stronger. 29...Wb6?l Black should have tried 29 -Se8! with the threat of 3O...fle2. At this point, the tempting 30.xf7? backfires due to 30..JJg51, exploiting the motif of a back rank mate. 30 flgfll £g5+ 31 &bl f$ Black has avoided a direct attack on f7, but now faces problems on the g-file. 32 h4l &f6 Or 32..JLxh4? 33 Wxa4 with the double threat of 34 Wxh4 and 34 Wd7+. 33 &al Wb5 34 Sgl! By the threat of 35 h$ White provokes Black's next move, which will clear the hfile for the attack. 34...£xh4 35 Eh3 £f6 36 Hghl f8 37 Wd2! threats, so Black resigned. In fact the bishop on a2 didn't move during this whole fragment, but it still performed an important role by controlling crucial squares such as f7, e6 and g8. Example 23 V.Kramnik-LVan Wely Dortmund 2008 White has already taken the first steps to a kingside attack, but it is unlikely to succeed unless more pieces participate. Kramnik finds a way to activate the bishop on b2. 17 -&xe4 dxe4 18 c5! This clever move exploits the vulnerable

In fact, by 15...a5 followed by 16..JLa6, he is trying to provoke the capture on f4. 16 £)xf4 Finally, let's see a complete game on the topic of clearing diagonals for our bishops. Example 25 G.Kamsky-G.Kasparov Manila Olympiad 1992 King's Indian Defence (E88) 1 d4 6 2 C4 g6 3 £>C3 £g7 4 e4 d6 5 f3 O-O 6 £e3 e5 A classical response to the Samisch Variation. 7d5c6 Considering that White often castles Improving the Pieces 16 O-O-O &a6 17 < xf 4 exf 4 18 £.xf4 2>e5 reaches similar play as in the game. 16...exf4 17 £xf4 &e5 In return for the pawn, Black enjoys control of the long diagonal and the powerful e5-knight 18 O-O-O 18 &b6? fails tactically to 18...£ixf3+, while after 18 O-O.a6 19 5fdl flc8 Black is better - Kasparov. It is evident that the g2g4 move doesn't fit very well with short castling. 18...6C4! Black prepares..JLd7 with an attack on b2, and simultaneously prevents 19 b6. 19 £e3 Kamsky finds the only response. 26 e5! b3 The simplifications arising after 26....&.xe5 27 f4 were not to Kasparov's taste. 27 axb3 axb3 28 £.xb3 Wb8 29 £)c4 £.xc4 30 txc4 £xe5 31 We2 Not 31 b3? Hc8 32 sfrc2 Bxc4+! 33 bxc4 Hb2+ and Black wins - Kasparov. Thanks to the inventive 26 e5 White managed temporarily to block the black bishop, thus avoiding a mortal capture on b2. Even so, his king is in a lot of trouble. The principle that the presence of oppositecoloured bishops favours the attacker applies well to this position. 31~Wa7l Black prepares an invasion down the afile. 32 Scl Kamsky deliberately exposes himself to a pin with Ji.f4 at any moment, aware that the loss of the exchange would be the least of his problems. 32...Sa8 33 b3 £f4 34 &c2 Ee71 The rook shifts to a better file.

For the related exercises, see page 301. The knight Due to its short range the knight usually becomes stronger the closer it gets to the centre. Typically it is looking for squares where it won't be chased away by the opponent's pawns, so-called protected squares or outposts. Let's see some examples on this topic. Example 26 Y.Pelletier-M.Sebag French Team Championship 2007 White has just played 22 b4, gaining some space on the queenside. Should Black prevent the further advance 23 bs or ignore it? 22...a6?

Usually Black needs active piece play in order to compensate for the weaknesses on d5 and d6, whereas in the above position, he has been left with the "bad" bishop. Thus White's plan suggests itself: install the knight on the protected square d5, exploiting the fact that Black has no minor pieces that can swap it off. 21C3! Preparing £ic2-e3-d5. 21...b4 If 21...Wc6 22 £k2.&g5, intending to swap the knight when it arrives to e3, then simply 23 b41 followed by Hdi and <bd5- The ability to use different routes to the same square is indeed a key virtue of the knight. On the other hand, after 21...Sc5 22 Edi! a5 23 £*c2 the knight will choose the e3-d5 route instead, after a preparatory 24 Wd3. Contrary to the previous subline,...&e7-g5 is unavailable here due to the d6pawn hanging. 22 C4 g6 23 g3 Simple but strong. Now Black's kingside attack is practically over, whereas the control of the c-file and the prominent knight on e5 are long-term factors in White's favour. 25...g6 Or 25...£tf4 26 g 3 intending Ec7 and c2 - Matulovic. 26 fic7 Wh4 27 Wd2 fif4 28 Eecl Exd4 29 Wh6! In a hopeless position Black lost on time. Improving the Pieces Another option was 23 £>c2l? Sc5 24 £)e3, speeding up the knight manoeuvre. 23...6.5 24 Edl! White should keep d5 clear for the knight. 24...a5 25 &c2 &g7 25-i.g5? failed to 26 Sxd6, while after 25 -Wc6 26 Wd31 the problem with the d6pawn remains. 26 Wd3 Of course the immediate 26 £ie3? failed to 26...Wxe4, but after the preparatory text move there is nothing that can stop £>e3d5. 26..JXc6 27 &e3 Wc8 28 &g2 A useful move that rules out... 113 at any moment. 28...We6 29 'OH el t.d8 30 <£d5 &g8 35 h4l g7?l Preferable was 3S—h5, complicating the enemy attack, although after 36 f3 g7 37 We2 followed by Sdl-hl and g3-g4, White's game is promising anyway - Polgar. 36 h5! After this White can clear the h-file whenever she likes. 36...£g5 37 Wf3 Sc8 38 Hdl Ec6 39 We2 Sc8 40 Shi £>g8 41 f 3l Sb8 42 Wf2 On f2 the queen not only controls the entire gi-a7 diagonal, but also gets closer to the h-file via gl-h2. 42..J2b7 43 hxg6fxg6 Or 43...hxg6 44 Wgl followed by Wh2 with a strong attack. 44 c5! A logical advance after the...fxg6 recapture, which left the black king more exposed towards the centre. 44...dxc5 45 Wxc5 £d8 46 Scl With the plan of Ec4 and We3-cl to seize the c-file and enable Sc8. White has a clear plus and went on to win the game. Example 30 G.Kasparov-J.Piket Tilburg 1997 White has fulfilled his plan. On d5 the knight is controlling a lot of important squares, and it can't be expelled nor exchanged. 30...Hc5 Or 3O....b6 31 Sd3 followed by Sf3 with attacking prospects - Polgar. 31We3 White now slowly prepares a kingside attack, exploiting Black's lack of counterplay. 31... -e7 32 Sd3 -&d8 33 Wd2 Ec6 34 Wdl In exchange for the pawn White has a lead in development Kasparov now seizes the initiative by means of a strong knight manoeuvre. 16 <hfd2!

By using this knight White clears the cfile and also keeps the £>e4-c5 resource. 19- &a5 20 &c2! Preparing Wd3 with a kingside attack. We saw a similar pattern in the previous game: once White has completed the knight manoeuvre, he is ready for action on other parts of the board. 2O...b3 21 £bl Wb6 22 Wd3 g6 2 3 2>c5!

unnecessary complications. 25-Wxa5 Now on 25 - xa5 the time is right for 26 h 5 with an irresistible attack. 26 2)xf7!

Quite often the idea of exploiting protected squares appears as a consequence of incautious pawn moves by the opponent. We already saw this in Pelletier-Sebag (22...a6?), and here is another example. Example 31 S.Guliev-J.Timman European Team Championship, Pula 1997 24 f4? Strengthening the knight on e5 but leaving the pawn structure in bad shape. The simple 24 £)cd3 was much a sounder option. 25 a5! An ingenious intermediate move to de- Improving the Pieces 24-.. d6! Timman immediately directs his attention to the newly created protected square at e4. reduce his counterplay. 36 Hf 7 Hxf7 37 gxf7+ Wxf7 38 Wxh6 He8! The last piece enters the game. 39h4Se6 40 Wf4»h5 25 g4 £}fe4 26 £kd3 f6 Black has been more cautious with his fpawn than his opponent, and now manages to expel the enemy knight from the centre. 27 ®f3 &c4 A nice square for the knight, but it doesn't really match its opposing number on e4. The more centrally placed, the more powerful are the knights! 28 el' h8 29Wh4 White prepares a kingside attack, but this is unlikely to succeed with the centre under Black's command. Moreover, the cibishop is out of play. 29-Wd7 30 g5 fxg5 31 fxg5 &g8 Timman also suggests the simpler 31...g6!?. 32 g6 h6 33 fe5!? XxeS 34 dxe5 We7l Avoiding 34...£>xe5? 35 -&b2! £>xd3 36 Sf7 and White takes over. 35 Wh5 81 Again 35...£}xe5? was wrong due to 36 $)xe5 Wxe5 37 'B'xeS Exe5 38 Hf7l with compensation - Timman. Instead, Black aims to exchange White's active pieces to Black enjoys a clear advantage thanks to his active pieces. In conclusion, we should remember that any pawn move leads to some kind of weakening; 24 f4? in this example handed over the e4-square to Black and restricted the white bishop. Example 32 G.Cabrilo-R.Ziatdinov Belgrade 1991 In this typical Spanish structure it is not easy for White to exploit his space advantage. The desired c4-c5 advance is unlikely to succeed in the near future; e g. 24 Ha2.d7 25 Hac2 Sec8 and Black holds. Instead, Cabrilo launches a slow, but powerful knight manoeuvre. 24 &ell Preparing £id2-b3-a5-c6, by which the passive knight would turn into a giant. 24...&d7 The closed nature of the position makes it difficult for Black to interfere with the opponent's plan. So he prefers to reinforce his queenside defence, aware that when the knight arrives at b3, the threat of c4-c5 will be renewed. 25 d2 Eec8 26 £>b3 &e7 27 Sa2! The queen's rook should also enter the game. The knight's jump to aS can wait. 27-Wa7 Another option is 27.Hc7 28 &a5 Wa7 preparing...Hbc8. At this moment, let's compare the knights on aS and a4. Both are situated on protected squares; however, the difference is that the white knight may soon jump to a more powerful one, i.e. 29 cxbS axbS 30 Hxc7 Wxc7 31 Hc2 Wb6 32 £>c6! with a clear advantage. 28 fiac2 £)e8 Enabling....e7-g5. There was no time for 28...JLd8?, heading for b6, due to 29 c5- 29 cxb5 After activating his pieces, White resorts to concrete action. The quiet 29 g31?, preparing 30 h4 to prevent...JLgS, was interesting as well, since 29...Jk.g5?! at once would fail to 30 cS. 29-.XXC2 3OWXC2 axb5 Or 3O..ic8 31 Wxc8! £xc8 32 Bxc8 Wd7 33 Hb8 with a decisive advantage. 31 £)a5 &g5 32 £d2Sa8 Prophylaxis against <2}a5-c6. 33 g3.fi.d8? Black should not have abandoned the kingside defence with his bishop. After 33 -hS! 34 £)c6 Wb7 35 h4.h6 he would have much better chances of resistance. 34 2>c6 Wa6 White has completed the manoeuvre initiated ten moves ago, and the knight is terrific on c6. But how to make further progress? 35.fi.el! The initial move of this example is repeated, and again it is very strong. Cabrilo wants to put his queen on e2, from where it can take part in a kingside attack and also puts pressure on the b5-pawn. 35...1.b6 36 62 )C7?! Black should have played 36....xe31, eliminating the £>e3-f5 resource. After 37 fxe3 (not 37 Wxe3?l b2 and the knight reaches c4) 37->b6 38 jLxbS?!.fi.g41 39 Wd3 &b2 Black obtains counterplay. So the immediate 36 £jf51? was probably more precise. 37 &f5.xf5 38 2ie7+! Thus White manages to keep a knight on the excellent f5-square. 38...6f8 39 £)xf5 Sd8 40 Hc6! f6 41 &g2! Some prophylaxis in view of the line 41 £jxd6? Bxd6! 42 Bxd6.fi.xf2+. Now the rest is easy. Improving the Pieces 41... wa7 42 'B'g4 £>e8 43 £xbs Hb8 44 Ec21 £d4 45 &xe8 Exe8 46 Sa2 Black resigned. Sometimes, the usage of a protected square is preceded by the exchange of the enemy forces that defend it. Here is a simple example. Example 33 Z.Hracek-Z.AImasi Odorheiu Secuiesc 1995 The strong knight leaves White better on the whole board, and he now opens a new front on the queenside. 33... c8 34&h2l Against the plan of „Jlg3 and...Wd8-h4. 34...'&d8 35 g3 £g5 36 a41 axb4 Or 36...bxa4 37 bSl, creating a terrific passed pawn. 37 Sxb4 Wb8 38 Wbl Saa7 39 a5! 39—Ea6 Black had to stop 40 a6, but now he succumbs on the b-file. 40 C4! Creating a strong passed pawn. 4O...£d8 41 Exb5 ExbS 42 cxb5 Exa5 43 Exa5 &xa5 44 b6 The further advance ofthis pawn is soon helped by the queen, so Black resigned. In the previous examples the protected squares were available from the very beginning. Now let's see a few different ways in which they can be created. Example 34 A.Vyzmanavin-F.Braga Benidorm 1993 White is slightly better thanks to his Black is just about to improve his pawn structure by 29-d5, while...£)b6-c4 is another interesting resource, for example if White snatches a pawn with 29 Wxbs?!. Hracek opts for a more strategical solution. 29 £xb6l A strong exchange that secures the d5square for the knight, and creates a "good knight vs. bad bishop" scenario. 29..Exb6 30 1! The knight hurries to d5 before Black manages to resume the...d6-d5 idea. 30...e7 31 £>e3 &h4 32 &d5! Eb7 After 32..JLxel? 33 £ixb6 Hb8 34 bxa5 White wins a decisive pawn. 33 Eebl space advantage. Vyzmanavin now opts for a concrete plan: the installation of a knight on d6. there. Now it helps Black in the fight for the central dark squares. 21 £.XC6 fi_xc6 22 £id2 White avoids the swap on f3 and prepares f2-f4 in order to reinforce his centre. 22...cxd4 23 Wxd4 2)c5 24 Sc3! With the strong knight on d6 paralysing the black camp, an attack on the king has every reason to succeed. 24...£xa4 25 £)2e41 White is better after 25 HxcS bxc5 26 Wxa4 Sxb2 27 £>2c4, but the text is more energetic. 25...6.6? Underestimating the enemy attack. Correct was 25..£)xe4 26 Wxe4.fi.e8, reducing the material, though after 27 flfcl f5 28 We3, intending Hc7, White has a great game anyway. 16e5!£b7 Also after 16..JLa6 17 £ie4 the knight reaches d6 with an initiative for White. 17 e4 C5 18 d6 ZZeb8 On 18....xf3 Vyzmanavin had planned 19 Wxf3 Hed8 20 Wg3 cxd4 21 f4l. Then White could consider Hcdlxd4 or even f4f 51? with attacking prospects. 26 f6+!*h8 After 26...gxf6 27 flg3+ &h8 28 exf6 Wc7 29 Hg7 the attack is irresistible: e.g. 29-Hg8 30 Hxh7+! &xh7 31 Wh4+ <£>g6 32 f 41 with decisive threats. 27 Sh3 gxf6 Or 27...h6 28 Wf4 Wf8 29 2)xf7+! and wins - Vyzmanavin. 28Wh4 In view of the imminent mate, Black resigned. 19.fi.b5 A clever move that enables Hci-c7 as a response to...c5xd4 at any moment. 19...£d5 2O 1B,e3 c6! Despite b4 being a protected square, the knight wasn't doing anything substantial Improving the Pieces the a2-g8 diagonal. 28 d5 a5 By swapping the a-pawns, Black avoids ending up with a weak pawn on a6 after White's C4-C5- 29 Wf4 The threat of 30 £jf6+ forces the exchange on d5. 29...-&xd5 30 fixd5 axb4 31 axb4 £)c6! Example 35 I.Cheparinov-J.Hellsten Belgrade 2002 Here is a less dramatic case of creating protected squares. White aims to exploit his space advantage by moves like £ja4, Sd2 and Ecdl, with pressure on the b6 and d6 pawns. How can Black generate some activity? 26...e5! A typical idea in such positions. Black deliberately weakens the ds-square, in order to transform d4 into a protected square for his knight. 27 fxe5 After 27 £jd$ £kl4 Black could soon swap the strong enemy knight by,...&xd5, whereas White is unable to do the same thing. Please note that with dark-squared bishops on the board, this would not be the case, thus the...e6-e5 idea becomes less appealing. By the text move Cheparinov avoids the...£k6-d4 idea but lets the black knight settle on another protected square. 27...6xe5 Not 27...dxe5? 28 Sxd7 Wxd7 29 <£dS Wd8 30 c5 with a clear initiative on the queenside. The bishop could soon exploit Black prevents 32 c5 with an indirect attack on e5, and also eyes the b4-pawn. 32 Hcdi After 32 b5? £>e5 White loses his dynamic potential on the queenside, while 32 Wd21? is well met by 32... c7 33 C5 bxc5 34 bxc5 Ebd8, when 35 Edl fails to 35- e7! 36 cxd6 Wa7+. In the game Cheparinov instead trades the b4-pawn for the oneon d6. 32...£)xb4 33 Exd6 Wc7 34 Wf6 Sxd6 35 fixd6 On 35 Wxd6 I had planned 35-Wc5+l? when both 36 hl He8 and 36 Wxc5 bxc5, followed by 37...Sc8 and maybe...£)c6-d4, seem to favour Black. 35... a6! Heading for the protected square at c5. 36 Sc6 Wd7 37 2xb6! White simplifies in order to avoid longterm inferiority due to his weak pawns. 37...Wa7 38 c5 xc5 39 Exb8+ Wxb8 40 i.c4 We8 41 e5! £>d7 42 Wc6 Wxe5 43 i.xf7+! &xf7 44Wxd7* We7 Draw agreed. 20...£k8 21 Ag5 2>6e7? A strategical error that leads to a "good knight vs. bad bishop" scenario. Correct was 21...Ef8 preparing...h7-h6, and only then...#ke7. Durao perhaps feared 22 fiedl, but after 22...Eds! he is still defending. 22 2tfd2 h6 23 Jixe71 Exe7 24 Ea3! Heading for b3 in order to attack b6. 24.- EC7 25 Sb3 Hc6 26 2te4 -fi.f8 27 *e2 Preparing g2-g4 and f2-f4 in order to open a second front. Fischer soon exploited his huge advantage. Now let's have a look at a few examples regarding "semi-protected" squares, where the knight feels quite safe despite a potential attack from an enemy pawn. Example 37 G.Garcia Gonzales-A.Karpov Linares 1981 Example 36 RJ.Fischer-J.Durao Havana Olympiad 1966 In this typical position from the King's Indian Attack, Fischer hurries to create a protected square for his knights. 17 a41 Fixing the pawn on b6 so that a knight can settle on c4 later on, without worrying about...b6-b5. Moreover, b5 and b6 might turn into long-term weaknesses. 17...5ad7? This stereotypical move does nothing to stop White's plan. Much better was 17-.g5! trying to trade the g-pawn for the central epawn, for example 18 h3 h5 19 £>xg5 £}xe5 with rather unclear play. 18 ifl! This bishop exchange makes it easier for White to exploit the weak c4- and b5-squares. 18...6xfl 19 £>xf1 2)de7 20 2>c4 Thanks to the clever 17 a4, the black pieces are now unable to get rid of the knight from C4- In a typical Hedgehog position White just played 23 & h2?!, accidentally exposing his king along the h2-b8 diagonal. Karpov reacts very opportunely. 23...h5l With the intention of 24.h4, softening up the dark squares around White's king. Improving the Pieces 24 h4 The threat was 24-h4 2 5 g4 d5+, and if White prevents this by 24 f4 h4 25 g4, then after 25...e5l 26 fxe5 Sxe5 Black is better anyway thanks to his dark square dominance. By 24 h4 White avoids such a scenario, but the lost control over g4 will soon make itself felt to enable the...b6-b5 thrust. 31 £f3 b5 32 cxb5 axb5 33 £g5 b4 With the simple idea of...£ b7-a6. White had a very difficult game and soon lost. Here is related case on the other flank: 1 e4 c6 2 d4 d5 3 £c3 dxe4 4 £xe4 £f5 5 £c5 (a rather rare, but not harmless line against the Classical Caro-Kann) 5...b6 6 £ib3 £lf6 7 £f3 e6 8 g3 (after the provocation of...b7b6, the kingside fianchetto makes sense) 8...a51? (intending...a4-a3 to soften up White's queenside) 9 a4 &.e7 10.g2 £d5 11 O-O O-O. Now on c2-c4 at any moment, there follows...£d5-b4 and the knight becomes excellent. The game Zo.Jovanovic- F.Doettling, European Junior Championship 1999, continued 12 c3 £d7 13 e2 Sa7 14 £)bd2 Hc7 and Black had no problems. Example 38 E.Rozentalis-I.Georgiadis Athens 2006 Sicilian Defence (B23) 1 e4 c5 2 £c3 a6 An interesting sideline against the Closed Sicilian. 24...5.8 25 &gl £g41 26 f3 £>e5 From now on, Karpov is ready to answer f3-f4 with...£>g41 at any moment, exploiting the fact that White can't play h2-h3 anymore. As a consequence, the knight is practically untouchable on e5, and Black obtains a great game. 27 Edd2 Wa7 28 £hl Hed8 29 f4? White loses his patience. As we already noticed, this move would be fine with the h-pawn still on h2, but in the present case it just helps Black to establish a strong knight on g4. Preferable was a non-committal move like 29 Wdl. 29...£g4 30 £dl?l An awkward square for the knight. White should have preferred something like 30 £,f3, although after 3O...Wb8!, preparing...b6-b5, Black is much better anyway - Kharitonov. 30...e5! Black deflects the other knight from d4 3 g3 b$ 4 £g2 &b7 5 d3 e6 6 f4 b41? 7 ce2 d5 8 e5 Black's previous two pawn moves had the merit of provoking e4-e5. Since his knight on g8 hasn't moved yet, it may now proceed directly to the "semi-protected" square at f$. 8...£>e7 9 C3 £>bc6 10 £tf3 11 O-O White could chase the knight away with 11 g4, but then ll...£ih41 is a little annoying for him. 11...h5! However, Georgiadis has seen a little further into the position. 13 g4 h31 14 £hl £>h6! Thanks to the clever 13.. h3, White now can't protect the g4-pawn by 15 h3. 15 g5?! After this Black regains control over f5 with an excellent game. White should have tried the active 15 f 5!? instead, although after 15...exf5 16 gxf5 £>xfs 17 £lg5 Wd7 Black defends quite well, whereas White has a long-term problem with his unsafe king. 15-. f5 16 g3 £>ce7! Keeping up the fight for the fS-square. In contrast, after 16...4ixg3? 17 hxg3 White would again have g3-g4at his disposal. 17 cxb4 cxd4! There was nothing wrong with 17...cxb4. but the text is more ambitious. In retrospect, White should probably have released the tension by 17 dxcS- 18 Sf2 Not 18 £)xd4? Wb6 19 £)ge2 £)c6 and Black wins a piece. In these positions we may observe that the knight on f5 is useful in preventing.cl-e3- 18...Wb6 A useful move that reinforces the f5square for the knight. Now if h2-h3 and g3g4 at any moment, then after swapping on g4 followed by...£)h4 or even...£}h6, Black obtains counterplay against White's weakened kingside. Thus quite often White prefers to let the knight stay on fs, at least for a while. 12 d4?l More cautious was 12 h3 preventing the course of the game. There can follow 12...1.e7 13 Wei aS 14 Wf2 £.a6 15 Hdl Wb6 with a tense struggle. If now 16 g4, then 16...hxg4 17 hxg4 £>h41 with counterplay. 12...h4l At first glance this is rather illogical since the knight is now expelled from f5. Black has a huge advantage, in great deal thanks to his fantastic knight on f5. Improving the Pieces From now on the position plays itself. 19 a3 Ac8 20 <de2 2>c6 21 Wd3 aS 22 b$ ±C5! 23 b3 Or 23 bxc6.a6 followed by 24-d3 with strong pressure. 23...£>a7 24 a4 £>c6! Again exploiting the 25 bxc6 jLa6 idea, Georgiadis gets his knight to the excellent b4-square. 25 £d2 £b4 26 £.xb4 Axb4 27 Adi *e7 28 Sffl Black also has strong pressure after 28 2>exd4 2>xd4 29 <bxd4 Sc3 3O e2Ah41. 28..Ac31 29 <bxc3 dxc3+ 30 Af2 &C5 31 Edfl Ac8 White is completely tied up and the rest is pure desperation. 32 &el&e3 33 f5 £)xfi 34 f6+ <&d7 White resigns. Going back to the first diagram, the combination of...&e7(h6)-f5 and...h7-hS are seen in a few other openings as well, such as the French and Caro-Kann. It also appears on the other flank, in terms of...£>d7(a6)-c5 and...a7-a5, in openings like the King's Indian and Bogo-lndian, among others. Finally, let's see the knight performing one of its favourite tasks: blocking enemy pawns. The blockade concept will be investigated more thoroughly later on in the book, so here I will restrict myself to two simple examples. Example 39 V.Mikhalevski-J.Ehlvest Lake George 2005 In exchange for the pawn Black enjoys active pieces and a strong passed pawn on d4. 33 £>el! Simple but strong. The knight is redirected to d3 where it will block the passed pawn. In contrast, 33 xd4?? Sed8 loses on the spot, while 33 <£)g5?! h6! 34 £)f7+ &h7 3 5 £*d6 1 d5 is also unconvincing for White. 33...Scd8 On 33...Ae2? there follows 34 Adell, winning thanks to a back rank mate, but not 34 Abel?? 2xel+! 35 Axel Wxcl and it is Black who wins. 34 Wg4 Ae2 35 Abel The immediate 35 £>d 3!? was possible as well. 35->a6? Preferable was 35 -.Ade8! 36 g3 Wb3 37 £)d3 &g8 with just a slight white advantage - Mikhalevski. 36 &d3 Cde8 37 g3 Wb7 38 Cel! Being a pawn up White is happy to exchange pieces. 38...Cxel+ 39 Cxel Black has a slightly cramped position and his development is yet to be completed. My first intention was the simple 17-.fi.d7 followed by...Rac8, but after 18 £>e4 Wb6 19 b41, preparing 4bc5. White obtains some initiative. Then I saw a better solution... 17...Wf6l The queen vacates the d6-square for the knight and takes control of the long diagonal. Such an arrangement also gives the bishop access to f5 and g4. 18 Cel 18 2>e4? fails to 18...Wxb2, so before activating his knight White improves his major pieces. Thanks to the extra pawn and the passive bishop on g7, White is clearly better. Please note here that 39-Cxel+ 40 ©ixel Wxb2? fails to 41 Wc8+, a line Mikhalevski surely observed when playing 38 Cel. Example 40 M.Stolz-J.Hellsten German League 2000 18...21d6 19 We2 Ee8 20 4 b5 A logical move in order to swap the strong enemy knight, but 20 £>e4 was a simpler way of achieving this; e.g. 2O...£)xe4 21 fi.xe4 fi.d7 22 Had Cac8, when Black has just a minimal advantage thanks to his active queen. 20...fi.g4l Tactics at service of strategy. Now after 21 Wxg4?l £)xb5 22 Wb4 £)d6 followed by...Cac8. the knight on its strong blockading post clearly outshines the bishop. 21Wd3Cac8 22 d4? At this moment Stolz perhaps thought that he was provoking a repetition of Improving the Pieces moves, but this is not so. 22 £>xa7?.f5 followed by...Sc2 leads to a strong black initiative, so preferable was 22 £ixd6! exd6 23 Wd2, eliminating the black knight. There can follow 23...&f3 24 £xf3 Wxf3 25 Wd4+ Wf6 with just a slight black edge. 22...5C4 23 Sec8! an open file often leads to control over the whole board, which is why both sides will fight for them by all possible means. One typical method in this sense is doubling rooks on the open file, sometimes even accompanied by the queen. Let's see a few examples. Example 41 J.Hellsten-LRojas Santiago 2006 Simple and strong. Black seizes the c-file and enables a future invasion on c2, whereas the a7-pawn is irrelevant. 24 &xa7? The last chance was 24 £>c3. admitting that the whole knight journey was flawed. In the game Black obtains too much activity. 24...fid4l 25 We3 Hc2 26 h3 This loses on the spot, but the alternatives weren't much better; e.g. 26 Sad Sxb2 27 h3 B.xh3! 28.lxh3 He4 and Black is winning after 29 Wc5 b6 or 29 Wc3 Wxc3 3OHxc3 fixel+. 26...€k4 Unable to keep the f2-pawn protected. White resigned. For the related exercises, see page 304. The rook The natural working areas for our rooks are open and semi-open files. The possession of White has a slight but enduring advantage thanks to the weakness on d5. He now proceeds with the seizure of the open file. 2OBacl!We7?! Black develops the queen with tempo, but now his rook remains misplaced on e5, a fact that will play against him in the battle for the c-file. In this sense, 2O...Hc8 was better, although White keeps the advantage with the simple 21 Hc2!, preparing to double rooks by Sfd. 21 e3 h5 If 21...a5, trying to swap pawns and create activity on the queenside, then 22 bS1followedbyHc6, with strong pressure. With 21...h5 Rojas instead secures a flight square for his king and enables...h5-h4 at some moment. ®g2 Unfortunately for Black the white king has an escape route via h3-h4. 32...Wf2+ 33 &h3 Wxfl+ 34 h4 g5+ 35 fxg5 f6 36 g6+l In view of the imminent mate, Black resigned. In structures with just one open file, control of that file becomes very important. Example 42 J.Rohl Montes-A.Zapata Ubeda 1997 22 Ec6l White aims to double the rooks on the cfile, and this is the best way to do it. From its entry square on c6 the rook interferes with the opponent's play and can be supported by b4-b5 if needed. 22.>Sd8 23 Hfcl g6 Black avoids any back rank mates, but also weakens the f6-square, something that I exploit with my next move. 24 Wd4l e4 If 24-.fld7 covering c7, then 25.h31 is unpleasant. 25Sc8 Another good option was 25 Hc7 Wf6 26 f 31 &d6 27 f4 Hf5 28 Wxf6 Exf6 29 £.xd5, transposing to a superior endgame. 25..JSxc8? This lets White install a decisive mating threat towards h8. 25.JZe8 was better, although after 26 Hlc7l We6 27 Exe8+ Wxe8 28 Oxa7 White ends up with an extra pawn. This is a rather typical scenario: the side that gains control of an open file, later manages to seize the seventh rank. 26 Exc8+ «4>h7 27 f41 Wd7 28 Kf8 We7 29 Eb8l Some geometry in order to pick up the black rook without losing my own one. 29...Wc7 30 Wxes fcl* 31 £fl Wxe3+ 32 25...Sd7l Black hurries to double the rooks before White manages to play Eal-dl. Another, equally strong way to do it was 25-fla7 followed by 26.JZad7. 26fiaalSad8 27 h3 In the event of 27 Sadi Black should avoid the natural 27 -flxdl?! 28 Exdl flxdl 29 Wxdl £}xe4 due to 30 Wf31 recovering the pawn. Much stronger is the prophylactic 27— g 6! just like in the game. Here both 28 Hxd7 Wxd7l and 28 Sd2 Hxd2 29 £)xd2 c5, preparing...c5-c4 and...Sd3, leave Black on top. Improving the Pieces 27...g6! Black creates a flight square for his king and gets ready to meet 28 Sadi? with 28...5xdl 29 Exdl Exdl 30 Wxdl £)xe4 31 Wf3 f 51, keeping the extra pawn. 28 We3 C5 Zapata slowly reinforces his position, aware that the opponent is short of active plans. Now 29 b6 is prevented. 29 >g5 C4 30 &e3? This leads to a difficult endgame. Preferable was 30 £}h2, heading for f 3. 30.. /bxe4 31 xe7 Sxe7 32 £)xc4 f 5! White is better thanks to his space advantage and the weak pawn on c6. Moreover, his bishop on h2 is very strong. 22 Xa2l A clever way of fighting for the a-file. Now Black can't reply 22...Exa2 23 Wxa2 Wa8? because of the bishop hanging on e7. 22...Wc8 23 Seal Wb7 24 b2l Preparing 25 Sa3 in order to triple the major pieces on the a-file. The immediate 24 Sa3?l was less accurate due to 24-fixa3 25 Sxa3fia8. 24... e6 25 Sa3 €k7 On 25.--fixa3 there follows 26 Wxa31 with the strong threat of 27 Wa7. By playing 25...£>c7 Klaman enables...Ee8-a8, e.g. 26 a2?! Exa3 27 Wxa3 Sa8. However, on c7 the knight also gets exposed to the white bishop, something that Yudovich exploits with his next move. 26Sa5!fixa5 In view of the threat 27.xc7 winning a piece, Black has to concede the a-file. 27 Sxa5 a6 Obviously 27-fia8? failed to 28 jLxc7. In conclusion, by tactical means White managed to seize the open file. 28 a3 £ab8 29 fia71 Wc8 30 &xb51? A tempting way of converting the advantage, although the more methodical 30 The powerful knight on e4 should stay on the board. Now it becomes evident that White can't stop...Ed8-d2 seizing the second rank. 33 £>xeS fixes 34 f3 Edl 35 fxe4 fxe4 36 fie3fixb2 With a sound extra pawn and active pieces, Black went on to win the game. Example 43 M.Yudovich-K.KIaman USSR Championship, Leningrad (seefollowing diagram) Ec7 Wd8 31 Wa7 was also strong - Romanovsky. 30...cxb5 31 £xbs White's pressure is overwhelming and the rest is easy. 31...6g7 32 £.xb8 xb8 33 £xe8 Wxe8 34 b$£f8 35 We3 «c8 36 Wf4 With the double threats of 37 Sa8 and 37 £)e5. In this desperate position, Black resigned. A common weapon in the battle for the open file is the occupation of entry squares. Here are two examples. Example 44 V.Anand-M.Adams FIDE World Championship, New Delhi 2000 27...Wd8! and Black covers the b6-square with improved defensive chances. 27...6.d8 After 27-Sxb6? 28 axb6 £)c8 29 b7 the passed pawn gets too strong. 28 f xf4 We7 29 Sabi! The greedy 29 Sxa6 permits 29...f5 with some counterplay, so Anand prefers to carry on with his plan. Now there is the threat of 30 Sb7 winning a piece. 29...5.8 30 Sb7 Just like in the previous example, the control of the open file leads to the seizure of the seventh rank. 30...We6 31 Wg5 h6 Or 31-.Wxh3 32 £>f4 Wh6 33 Wxh6 gxh6 34 JLc6 followed by £.d5 with an enormous advantage. Black can hardly move, and the a6-pawn is easy prey. 32 Wg3 Wf6 33&f4 Heading for the protected square on d5. 33...£>e7 34*g2! The tempting 34 Sxe7?l Wxe? 35 Wxg6 permits 35..-Sb8! - Anand. By 34 g2 White avoids any future queen check on al. 34... g8 35 £)d5 We6 36 Adi! White has some advantage mainly thanks to the misplaced knight on a7. Before recovering the pawn on f4, Anand takes a grip on the queenside. 27 Sb6! A power move that attacks Black's weak pawns and prepares the doubling of rooks on the open b-file. In contrast, the immediate 27 Wxf4?l was less effective due to Installing the threat of 37 Ag4- Now both 36...f5? and 36...h5? fail to 37 £)f4. while 36...£)f6 permits 37 Se7 'H'cS 38 £)xf6 gxf6 39 Wf4 &g7 40 Eb6. Black resigned. Improving the Pieces 26...exf4 27 d4 -fid7 28.fi.e5 After 28._fi.xf5 29 exf5 the pawn is untouchable due to 30 d7. 29 xh6 Wh7 30 g4 -fi.xg4 31 -fi.xg4 f 3 32 gxf3 At this point Black apparently resigned, although by 32...Wh2+ 33 fl -fi.xd6 he could have kept on fighting for a while. In contrast, 32 g31 preparing 33 d7 would have left him completely helpless, now that 32...Jfixg3? fails to 33 Wd4+. Another idea in the fight for an open file is to exchange, deflect or obstruct the enemy pieces that are defending it. Let's see a few examples. Example 45 V.Smyslov-B.Ivkov Rovinj/Zagreb 1970 In this position from the King's Indian, Black is just one move away from 21.JXad8, reaching a balanced game. Thus Smyslov hurries to take command of the d-file, using an entry square. Example 46 LPolugaevsky-GPartos Biel Interzonal 1985 21Sd6!flad8 If 21...g4?l at any moment, then 22 £jh4 glances at f5 and g6. White also keeps the pressure after 21...Wf7 22 b3, with ideas like Jfic4 and Wc3- 22 Sfdl Exd6 Now White obtains a strong passed pawn; however, the pressure along the dfile was quite annoying for Black. 23cxd6 Wf6 24Wc5l The queen gets ready to support the advance of the passed pawn, and also keeps an eye on the f2-pawn. 24...a4 25 b6 Wf7 Parrying the threat of d6-d7. 26 gxf41 A key capture that opens new horizons for the knight. Now if 26...gxf4 then 27 h4l followed by £\f5, while in the game the knight finds another route to get there. Black is just one move away from playing...Hf8-c8! with resistance on the c-file. 20 jfia6! A strong decision. Polugaevsky has nothing against swapping the opponent's "bad'' bishop, if this can help him in the fight for the open file. In contrast, the natural 20 Wc2 proves less effective after 2O...£ld7! 31 g4! Wxb2 32 g5 Wb4 33 Wg6 Wf8 34 Hf7l Before capturing on h6 White rules out 34...Wf6. With mate imminent, Black resigned. (but not 2O...2c8? 21 Wxc8+! followed by checks on h8 and f7). e.g. 21 £>g6 2c8 or 21 £}xd7 Wxd7 22 Wc7 Wxc7 23 Hxc7 Ef7 and Black defends. 20...Wb8 If 2O....a8, then 21 Wc2l followed by Wc7, just like in the game. 21 Xb7 Wxb7 22 Wc2! White prevents 22...Ec8, thus securing the open file. He is now ready for Wc2-c7, invading the enemy camp. 22...5e8 Or 22...£>d7 23 £>g6! followed by 24 Wc7 with a clear advantage. 23 Wc7 He7 24 Wd6! &h7 Parrying the threat of 25 £>g6. 25 h3Se8?l 25..£te8 26 Wd8 offered more resistance; e.g. 27 2c8 2e8 28 2c7 Hxd8 29 Hxb7 Hc8 with modest counterplay. 26 2c7 Wa6 Example 4 7 L.Pachman-OJakobsen Barcelona 1975 White is better thanks to his active pieces, but the tension along the open d-file makes it difficult for him to progress on the kingside. For example, if 26 Hel intending Se3-g3, then 26..JZd3! with counterplay. Pachman finds a more subtle plan. 26 jLc3l Intending 27 il.a5 in order to weaken Black's defence of the d-file. 26...Bbc8 Black could stop the bishop move to a5 by 26...Wc7, but then after 27 Eel the rook transfer to g3 is inevitable, seeing as 27-Ed3? fails to 28 We4+. 27 £as Exdl+ 28 Exdl &e7 Preparing,Jkf6-d4 to obstruct the white rook. 29 Wf 31 An ingenious fork in the fight for the open file. Pachman has seen that after 27 d71 White gives up his strong knight in order to enhance the attack on the black king. 27...&xd7 On 27...£>e4 Polugaevsky had planned 28 We5l with the decisive threat of 29 £tf8+. 28 Wxd7 Eg8 29 Wxe6 Wxa2 30 Wxf5+ *h8 A pawn up with active pieces, White is winning. He now initiates a final attack. Improving the Pieces 29...Wxf3 30 gxf3, followed by Hd7, his active rook is a much more relevant factor than his pawn structure. On the other hand, if Black defends the f7-pawn by 29.We8, then after 30 Wb7! the double threat of 31 Hd7 and 31 Wxa6 is highly unpleasant. 29...*g8 Jakobsen opts for a third solution: bring the king into the game. 30 Wxc6 Sxc6 31 Ed7 £f8 32 Hb7 &e8 33 £c3! Provoking a weakness on the kingside. 33...f6 After 33...£.f6 34 £.xf6 gxf6 35 fib8+ followed by 36 flh8. White obtains a dangerous passed pawn. 34 fla7l Curiously, the rook on its own is restricting the movements of the whole black army. 34...Hd6 35 &fl e5? Now the light squares are seriously weakened. Preferable was 35...Hc6 with a waiting game, or 35 -Sd3 36 &e2 Ed6 (the bishop was poisoned) in the same spirit. 36 &e2 He6 37 g41 enter the enemy camp. 37...fib6 38 &d3 &f7 39 *e4 e6 40 f3 Hc6 41 Hb7 £f8 42 £.35 £.e7 43 Sb6! Black resigned. There could have followed 43 -.Hxb6 (here or later, 43~<&d6 allows 44 &f5) 44 £.xb6 £.d6 45 a 3! £f8 46 £a5 £.d6 47 b4 and the passed pawn soon decides. Example 48 Y.Griinfeld-Y.Kraidman Gausdal 1982 In this typical position from the Spanish, White applies a well-known idea from the encounter A.Karpov-W.Unzicker, Nice Olympiad 1974. Grilnfeld temporarily inserts his bishop on the a-file, in order to gain time for the tripling of the major pieces. A more relaxed line such as 22 Wa2 fic8 23 Hal (again, 23 £a7! is strong) permits 23- -Ex a 3 24 Wxa3 £>C5 25 Wa7 Wxa7 26 Hxa7 £.d8! followed by...£.b6 and Black defends. 22...WC7 23 Wa2 Eec8 Due to the restrictive effect of the bishop on a7, unlike his opponent Black can't bring more major pieces to the a-file. Fixing the enemy pawns on dark squares, just before Black manages to play 37.f5. As a result White's king may soon With 23..Sec8 he aims instead at improving his king's knight by...Jk.e8 and...5Jd7-c5. 24 Hal.fc.e8 25 b4! Fighting against the enemy plan. 25...cxb3 26 #xb3 ®h5 On the search for counterplay. The tension along the a-file makes the desired 26...5.c5?? lose a piece to 27 Jfcxc5- 27 Wd7 28 c4? Initiating action against Black's cramped queenside. As for the bishop on a7, White is still awaiting the right moment for its withdrawal; besides it is being useful in taking the b8-square from the black rooks. 28...bxc4 Here or later 28...5Jf4 29 Jk.fl doesn't make a big difference. 29 5Jxc4.fc.d8 3OWb4 Griinfeld stops any tricks with 3O...5Ja5, which can now be met by 31.fce3 1 Sab8 32 5Jb6 winning material. 30...g6 3O...5Jf4l? 31 -fcfi f5 seems preferable, as the text lets White invade via the b-file. 31 Hbl! 5Jc5 32.xcSl dxc$ Black is forced to weaken his pawn structure, since the intermediate 32...fixa3? fails to 33 5Jfxe5! dxe5 34 Wxa3, winning a pawn. 33 Wb7! Seizing the seventh rank. 33-Hxa3 34 5Jxa3f6 The e5-pavvn needed protection, but now the a2-g8 diagonal falls into White's hands. 35 -fc.c4! &f8 36 d6! 5Jf4 37 Wxd7 -fcxd7 38 Hb7 Thanks to his strong passed pawn and active rook. White is clearly better and went on to win the game. Now let's move over to positions where there are not yet any open files on the board. The following example is about control of potentially open files, a subject that was observed already by Aaron Nimzowitsch in his legendary work My System. Example 49 A.Lugovoi-V.Orlov St Petersburg 1996 White has a slight but stable advantage thanks to the weakness on d6. He now starts working on the d-file, aware that he can clear it by d4xc5 whenever desired. 14 Hadi Had8 From Black's perspective,...C5xd4? at any Improving the Pieces 19 'ixgl £ib4 2O£lb5 This fork helps W hite seize the open file. 20...Wb7+ 21 f3 21 Wf3l? looks even stronger; e.g. 21...Wxf3+ 22 &xf3 Hxd2 23 Sxd2 £>xa2 24 £>xa7 followed by 25 Hd7. 21...Hxd2 22 Wxd2! moment would expose the d6-pawn after Hxd4. Therefore it is White who decides when to clear the d file. 15 Hd2l In the same spirit of the previous move. Obviously 15 d5?! e5 would go against the logic of the position. 15...b6 Following 15„.Jlc6 16 Hfdl Black would probably have to defend the c5-pawn by 16...b6 anyway, thus transposing to the game. 16..JLxe4?l 17 Wxe4 b6, on the other hand, loses a pawn after 18 Wb7l Wxb7 19 &xb7 2>c7 20dxc5- 16fifdl£c6 17 dxc5 Having activated his rooks White proceeds with the clearance of the d-file. Black can't avoid this, since both 17...bxc5? and 17...6.C5? drop the d6-pawn, while 17..JLxe4? fails to the intermediate 18 exd6 winning a pawn. 17...dxc5 18 d6! Thanks to the prior doubling of rooks Lugovoi is able to install the knight on d6, where it dominates the whole board. 18...Axg2 If 18..JSd7, preparing 19.flfd8, then 19 lxc6 Wxc6 20 5! fixd2 21 £ie7+ &h8 22 Wxd2 Wc7 23 Wd7, followed by £k6, with a clear endgame advantage. Just like in several of the previous examples, the stronger side recaptures with the queen, so as to be able to invade on the seventh rank later on. 22...a6?l Now the b6-pawn becomes a serious weakness. Black should have continued 22...£ixa2 23 Hal a6! 24 £id6 Wb8! 25 Hxa2 Hd8 26 Hxa6 g61, restoring the material balance on the next move with just a slight disadvantage. Obviously such lines are easier to work out after than during the game. A familiar pattern: after securing the open file, the stronger side seizes the seventh rank. 24...Wxd7 25 Hxd7 Hb8 Or 25-..Hd8 26 Hxd8+! 2)xd8 27 £)a4 and White wins a pawn. In the game we will soon reach the same situation. 26 Hd6! £)b4 27 a3 &c2 28 &f2 &f8 29 &a4l Having neutralized the enemy knight the knight from e6. 18 £b5Se7 19-&-C7I Diverting the queen from the d-file, so that...£)e6 at any moment can be met by JLd6, trapping the rook. 19...Wc8 20 Eb3! White utilizes his "blocking bishop" to triple the major pieces, an idea we already came across in Griinfeld-Kraidman (p. 65). 20...We6 21 Hc3 Sc8 22 £d3 g6 23 h3 Also interesting was 23 £)e5l? preparing f4-f5, when Black might soon have to hand over the bishop pair by....xe5- In the game Garcia Palermo prefers to improve his position slowly, conscious that he is much better in the long run, thanks to his control of the only open file. 23...&g7 24 Wa4 fla8 25 -fi.g3 Finally the bishop is withdrawn to enable 26 Ec7. 25...a6 26 Hc71 b5 27 Wb4&ae8 28 a4 Thanks to his active pieces, White keeps a clear plus. threats, White is ready to pick up the pawn. 29...b5 30 cxb5 axb5 3 1 £>xc5 Lugovoi later converted his extra pawn into a win. The next three examples feature the clearance of a file as a strategical method. Example 50 C.Garcia Palermo-J.Bibiloni Buenos Aires 1998 Example 51 G.Stahlberg-M.T aimanov Candidates Tournament, Zurich In an Orthodox Queen's Gambit Black swapped knights with...£)e4xc3 somewhat too early, and White is now able to clear the c-file for his major pieces. 15c4!£b7 White is also noticeably better after 15...dxc4 16 JLxc4 A.b7 17 e4, thanks to his strong pawn centre that may soon move forward. 16 cxd5 cxd5 17 Efcl! The last piece enters the game, joining the battle for the c-file. 17...2rf8 In the event of 17...Hc8 White could consider 18 JLC7I We7 19 Wa4 with pressure on Black's queenside. In the game. Black instead aims at covering the c7-square with Improving the Pieces At first sight White seems to have the more active position, with the desired e2-e4 advance just about to take place. 10...b5l A strong move with various virtues: it gains space, prepares to dislocate the enemy knight by...b5-b4, and produces a structure with an open c-file where the bishop on g2 tends to lose strength. 11 cxb5 cxbS 12 Wdl b4 Unblocking the bishop and preventing the advance e2-e4. 18 £xa6 wxa6 19 «f3 Efc8 20 Wb3 ®e4 21 £)d2 Ec2l Black could have won material by 21...Excl 22 Saxcl £)xd2, but Taimanov prefers to seize the second rank with his rook, where it keeps the enemy pieces on al and cl out of play. 22 £)xe4 dxe4 2 3 a3 h5l Opening a second front with ideas like...h4-h3 and...Wb5-f5-f 3 attacking the white king. Black later won. Example 52 T.V.Petrosian-D.Bronstein USSR Spartakiad, Moscow 1967 13&bl?l This passive retreat just complicates White's development. The natural 13 a41 led to a approximate equality after 13... c6 14 £>xc6 >xc6 15.g5 followed by Eel. 13...6C6 14&xc6 Wxc6 15 &d2 Wb6! This is a clever attack on the d4-pawn, just when White was about to play the advance 16 e4. 16 e3? A serious positional error that buries the bishop on cl and delays the battle for the open file. By 16 £>b3 Hac8 17.g5 followed by Ecl, and hopefully £k5 one day, White could still fight for equality. 16...Eac8 17 £.fi Sc6! Simple and strong. We can already imagine the invasion at c2. White appears to be better thanks to his space advantage and the active knight on e5- However, a closer look reveals that Black has a dangerous plan at his disposal:...f7-f6 and...e6-e5 to seize the centre and open up the position for the bishop pair. Thus White needs to proceed energetically. 19Sbl! Petrosian prepares b4-b5 in order to clear the b-file, thus creating a target for his pieces on b7. In the event of slower moves such as 19-Wc7, White could adjust his plans slightly with 20 a4 followed by b4-b5, in order to create a passed pawn. 20 £d3 -*tf7 rook not only helps White in the battle for the b-file, it will also control the whole sixth rank in case Black goes...e6-e5- 23...C5 Or 23-2fb8 24 Wb3 followed by 25 fibl and White takes command of the open file. 24 dxe5 fxe5 Thus Black fulfilled his plan. However, White's superior piece activity makes him well prepared for a tactical battle, and this is where Petrosian takes the game with his next move. 25 xes! Wxc5 After 25..xe5 26 £ixd5 White recovers the material straight away. 26 Sc6 *37 Now after 27 £lxf 7?! Sxf7 not only the d5-pawn will be hanging, but also the one on f2. Thus Petrosian prefers a direct attack on Black's king, exploiting the range of the rook on b6. 27 ®g4l £h8 28 ®xh6 jk.e8 With double threats against c6 and f2; however... 29 Sxe8! Wxf2+ Or 29...Sfxe8 30 Wh5 with similar play as in the game. 30 £h2 Saxe8 31 Wh5! Wei 32 2tf5+ *g8 33£>xg7 Sfl 34Wxe8+ Black resigns. 21 b5! In contrast to the previous note, after 21 a4?l Se8 22 b5 e5? Black now achieves his plan, with good play. So Petrosian hurries to carry on with his own plan. 21...WC7 After 21...a5?l 22 b6, followed by £}bS, the knight gets interesting prospects at d6 and c7. 22 bxa6 bxa6 If 22...Sxa6?l, then 23 £lb5, heading for the excellent dG-square. 23Sb6l A nice and logical move. From b6 the Improving the Pieces In the second half of the previous example, we witnessed the strength of a rook controlling a whole rank. Let's see a few more examples related to this subject. Example S3 E.Agrest-5.Brynell European Team Championship, Gothenburg 2005 less, the simple 16 Eh31? might have been even stronger 16...£ d7 17 2)xf6+ Wxf6 18 Eg 31 Now this is the preferred file for the rook, in order to support the £cl-g5 idea. 18..Jtxa4? This leads to immediate defeat. 18...h6? was also bad due to 19 Wd21 with a double threat at h6 and b4; but 18...Efc8! 19 Jig 5 Wf5 20 iih6 g6 could have prolonged Black's resistance - Brynell. 19 b3 £c6 20 d$! With the deadly idea of 21 ib2. 20...£)xd5 21 £b2 Wh6 In a typical isolated queen's pawn structure White launches a strong rook manoeuvre. 15fla3! Heading for g3 or h3 to enhance an attack on the black king. 15...We7 This seems a little slow, but it is not easy to find a satisfactory defence. For example, after 15...b6 16 Eh3 £-b7 17 d5!

In the previous examples we often came across the seizure of the seventh rank, usually as a consequence of controlling a file. Here is a final example on this topic. Example 55 M.Petursson-P.Lyrberg Reykjavik 1996 30 Wxe6! Although it is not that easy to foresee at this very moment. White now forces a winning endgame. 30...£>xe6 31 £>f6+ &h8 32 Sxf7 £g7 33 £xg7+ 2>xg7 34 Edd7l Ef8 35 Exb7 Sxf7 36 Exf7 Despite material equality. Black resigned - and not too early! The point is that he can never free his pieces due to the mating threats, whereas White will just bring his king to the queenside and eliminate the pawns on c5 and a6 with an easy win. For the related exercises to this section, see page 307. The queen As any chess player knows, the queen is a terrific attacking piece. This virtue is well illustrated in the following example. 22 c5!

Finally, an example that shows the great queenside too exposed. mobility of the queen, which lets her change working area with remarkable speed. Example 61 V.Smyslov-V.Simagin Moscow 1967 35Wc3l Smyslov exploits the fact that the c-file has become temporarily available and now threatens 36 Wc8+.

Black resigned. For the related exercises, see page 311. The king As beginners we are taught to castle quickly in order to secure the king and bring the rook into the game. Indeed, it would be illogical not to exploit such a powerful move, that lets us improve two pieces at the same time. Thus in many openings, castling is made almost automatically, in particular to the short side. Here we will see some examples where it is less clear if, when, and to which side to castle. White is clearly better thanks to his active pieces and Black's deficient pawn structure, in particular the e6-pawn. Having noticed that his queen isn't really doing anything on the kingside, Smyslov opts for her transfer to the opposite flank, in order to open up a second front. 32 Abl! I.h8 33 Wd3 Eg7 Trying for a counterattack, but now the e6-pawn becomes exposed. However, a more solid defence such as 33.Se8 34.a2 lcc8 also led to problems after 35 Wb3!, with the double threat of 36 Wxb7 and 36 Wb4+ followed by37Wd6. 34 b3l Eb6 Unfortunately for Black any defence of the b7-pawn implies some concession.

Example 63 J.Rosito-J.Hellsten Mendoza 2005 Black is just one move away from completing his development, but which one? 18...O-O? A bad decision since White's reply will leave the black king in a lot of trouble. Much better was 18...£.c6 19 f4 O-O-01 - Short. White is not yet capable of creating any direct queenside threats, besides which the existence of the open d-file makes a king's attack less likely to succeed; e.g. 20 2)f3.xf31? 21 Sxf3 -S-cS! with counterplay. Even the immediate 18...O-O-01? seems fine. 19 Axf 61 gxf6 20 Wg4+ Now White's attack plays itself. 20...$h7 Or 2O... h8 21 Wh41 &g7 22 2)e4 Ae7 23 &f4 heading for h5 with a strong attack - Short. 21 C)e4l f5 If 21...£.e7, then 22 £>xf6+! &xf6 23 Ac2+ <£118 24 We4 and wins. 22 £)f6+ &h8 23 ®h4 &g7 24 Sadi! The last piece enters the game, with ideas like d4(+) and Hd3-g3- In contrast to the previous example, here the option of long castling is discarded. So why not go 15...O-O right away, securing the king and bringing the last piece into play? Well, it transpires that after 16 &xb7 &xb7 17 £)e41 White obtains a dangerous attack, with ideas such as 18 JLf6, 18 £)f6+ and 18 £) d 6. Thus I decided to postpone castling until a safer moment. 15...fld4l A strong move, fighting for the key square e4. 16 Axb7 Now after 16 JLf6 O-O! Black doesn't have to fear the enemy attack, since the white knight isn't participating. In the game Rosito prepares its transfer via e4. 16...Wxb7 17 f3 h6l 20 c3 £>d5 21 b3? A tactical oversight in a complex position. After 21 Hadi!

Despite certain difficulties in mobilizing the rook, Black is clearly better thanks to the extra pawn and superior activity. 25 b4 The strongest reply, since both 25 flci? and 25 -$.d4?l run into 25...£>f4 with double threats. 25...We5 26 fldl We2 27 Sal We5 28 fldl We2 29 Sal £tf4 30 Wg3 Asking the question of the bishop before castling. 17...O-O?! is still dangerous due to 18 £)e4 £id5 (or 18...£.xe5 19 "S xcS with multiple threats) 19 c31, intending 19...fld3? 20 £)f2. 18 Ae3 After 18 £f6 O-O 19 2)e4 £)d5 20 c3 (here, and on the next move, 20 £)xc5? fails to 20...Wb6) 2O...fid3 21 &hl Wb6 intending...c5-c4, Black also manages to neutralize the enemy attack with level play. 18...flc4 19£>e4£xe5 Just in time, before White lands a knight on d6. Now White wins the exchange, but Black obtains ample compensation. Here the game continued with 3O...We5?l 31 Del Wg5 32.d4! O-O 33 Wxg5 hxg5 34 £.f6 and White recovered the pawn. Instead, by 3O...g5 31 &hl &d7! preparing...&c6-b7 and...2d8, Black could have secured his king without dropping the pawn, while his active queen restricts the enemy counterplay. In conclusion, when resolving the "king problem" be as flexible as possible! Improving the Pieces Now let's examine two cases where Black deliberately dismisses both castling options, and finds a better destiny for the king. Example 64 G.Kasparov-A.Karpov Linares 1994 Instead, the game continued 24...Hhb8?! 25 g3! Wxd3+ 26 £xd3 b4 27 Hal! bxa3 28 bxa3 Hb3 29 £c2 Hxa3 30 Hxa3 £xa3 31 Hal £.b2 32 Hxa4 Hxa4 33 -&xa4 £xd4 34 f4 and with play on a single flank, Kasparov easily held his own despite the minus pawn. 25 Axf4 JLxf4 26 Wxc4 If 26 Hcdl, then 26....Hhd8! with serious pressure on the d4-pawn. 26...bxc4 27 Hbl Hhd8 28 Hhdl £g5! Intending...f7-f5 and...Af6 with pressure on the weaknesses on d4 and b2. Black has much the better game and the contrast to the initial position is striking. Example 65 T.V.Petrosian-M.Botvinnik Training match, Moscow 1952 At first sight the position appears somewhat troublesome for Black. He can't play 22...O-O?? due to 23 Wh7 mate, and 22...0-O-O? 23 Hci is also bad for him. Karpov finds a third solution. 22...6e7l An excellent move. On e7 the king is relatively safe and the king's rook can enter the game. 23HclWc4! The queen's exchange clearly favours Black, since it finishes off any white attacking prospects and leaves the king on e7 well placed for the endgame. 24&e2?! Following the opponent's example, but now Black manages further favourable simplifications. Karpov suggests 24 g 3! and only then 25 &e2, thus preventing any black bishop or knight move to f4- 24...£>f4+! Here we will seethe same idea in a more aggressive context Black has already started a kingside advance but, before continuing it, he has to respond to the threat of 17 £id6+. Botvinnik finds the most appealing solution. 16...&f8l A safe square for the king, while the rook remains active on h8. 17 £jfl Trying to improve the passive knight. 17 £}d6? Wb8 was useless, while 17 O-O?! permits 17-.g4! followed by...f 7-f5 and...h5-h4 with an attack. 17...g4 18 e$!

S*g8! 31 Ef3 Wcl+ 32 &e2 Ec2+ 33 &flWd21 White resigned in view of the continuation 34.fi.e2 Wd4. In the previous example we saw Petrosian trying to secure his king by ' ldl-c2-bl1 and in my game with Rosito I missed a similar option with...?d7-c6-b7- Such king marches are indeed quite frequent in practice, particularly in closed positions such as the following one. Example 66 V.Anand-J.Timman Tilburg 1991 Black still needs to resolve the problem of his king. But if 20...O-O?! then 21 £>h5 followed by £ih2 and Wg4, or even.fixh6 and Wd2, yields White a promising attack. As for the other flank, long castling is no longer available. Timman comes up with a creative solution. 20...&d8! Intending... c7-b8 in order to secure The last piece enters the game with a clear advantage. The difference between the two kings is striking. Improving the Pieces the king on the queenside, where it will feel much safer than on g8. 21We2 White intends a2-a4 striking at Black's queenside, but this is easily parried. 21...£a3 22 Ec2 ®b4l 23 Hxc8+ &xc8 The king gets one step closer to its destiny. 24 Acl If 24 &.bl -2ic6 25 -fi.cl £.e7 Black is fine. 24...6.d3 Timman's suggestion.

Now after 26 £}h5 g6 the knight can no longer enter at f6, so Black has a comfortable game. In a typical King's Indian battle Black is close to achieving...g5-g4 with a strong attack on the enemy king. Thus White resorts to a common defensive idea in closed positions: transfer the king to the opposite flank. 21 &f2l g4 22 £el Obviously 22 fxg4?

A king march can also be effected by a castled king, as in the next example. Example 6 7 Y.Zherebukh-A.R.S.Salem Moscow 2009 23 &d2 The king is already quite safe, and White's positional triumphs on the queenside make his position preferable in the long run. 23...£)h4 24 Egl Sg6 25 &c2 2>f6 26 £a4l By means of the threat 27 £>xb6 White transfers his knight to the more active d3square, where it will enable a positional sacrifice on e5. 26.. £b8 27 £)ab2 Wc7 28 £)d3 #)e8 29 td Wg7 30.&C3 €if6 31 &b3!

Beginners are advised to constantly protect their king, and activate it only when the endgame is reached. This is quite a valid recommendation, and in the later section on prophylaxis we will take a closer look at different techniques of protecting the king. However, there are in fact middlegame situations when the best or only de-

"brave king". As often occurs in the Open Sicilian White is ahead in development, but Black has a better pawn structure in the long run. Thus White should act quickly before the opponent manages to consolidate. 19 Sxf7!? A tempting sacrifice, considering that the black king is now forced to leave the back ranks. Nevertheless, 19 We4l Sc8 20 Ji.xe7 Wxe7 21 c3! was objectively better, opening a second front on the queenside - Berg. Here 21...bxc3?l fails to 22 Wa4+! &f8 23 Wxa6 with a strong initiative.

Backward movements failed to 21 Wxa8+, while 20....f6? 21 £.xf6! yields White a crushing attack; e.g. 21...gxf6 22 Wxf6+ g8 23 Sd3, heading for g3. 21 We4+&xg5!

We already saw this in the final part of Hellsten- Rojas, and here is another example. White has won the exchange, but his king is rather unprotected and Black enjoys an active queen. At this point 33...£xa2?? obviously fails to 34 Exg7+ with mate, but by 33 -Wxf4! Black would keep the balance; e.g. 34 e6 We4+ 32 h2 We5+ 36 #hl £h5 37 JXg2 g6l, when his king is probably the safer one.

The bishop pair The bishop pair is usually a great strategical asset at any stage. We already saw some proof of this in a number of previous examples, such as Gufeld-Kolarov, Kramnik- Gelfand and Vokac-Navara. Here is one more example that shows the strength of the bishop pair. Example 70 A.Miles-J.Sunye Neto Linares, Nuevo Leon 1994 Seizing the d-file and preparing a future 4bd6 to fight against the blocker on b$. 28.. 6.7 29 Edl Ec7 30 Wb2 By threatening 31 £f4 White aims to provoke...e6-e5, though the immediate 30 <bd61? looked just as strong. 30...e5 31Wd2l Resuming the £id6 idea. 31...We6 32&d6&d4 Or 32...£ixd6 33 Wxd6 Wxd6 34 Exd6 and the a6-pawn is doomed. 33 £xd4 Wxd6 34 £e31 Wxd2 35 Sxd2 The exchanges have left Black's a6-pawn more vulnerable. 35...£b7 36 Ed6 £>b8 37 £a7l A clever intermediate move. 37 &.b6 at once permits 37.-Ec6, swapping White's active rook. 37... c6 38 £b6 Ee7 This kind of position, with pawns on both flanks and an open centre, is much to the liking of the bishop pair. Miles now begins slow manoeuvring play with the aim of increasing the power of the two bishops. 25e4l A move with various virtues: it restricts the bishop on a8, deprives the black pieces of the d5-square, and grants the gl-a7 diagonal to White's own bishop. 25...<bb5 Thus Black complicates the attack on his a6-pawn. However, in the further course of the game it is not easy for him to find an active plan. 26 f3 Ec8 27 -fi.e3 h6 28 WdZ 39 £c4! Thanks to...e6-e5, both bishops are now noticeably active and start to cooperate. 39..J6 Black is also suffering after 39-..£)xb4 40 -&d8! Ee8 41.xf7 Ef8 42 JLg6+. The eSpawn is a long-term problem. 40 £e6l Much stronger than 40 £d5?! xb4 41 £d8 2ixd5! 42 £xe7 xe7 43 Hd7 £xe41 with chances for a draw - Miles. Improving the Pieces 40...6xb4 41 fi.C5l a5 42 fi.f5+ g6 43 Sxf6 White has not only recovered the pawn, but also managed to damage Black's pawn structure. 43...5g7 44 fi e6 &d3 45 -&-d6! Not 45 lc7 with unnecessary counterplay. In the game the black rook finds itself severely restricted by the bishop pair, and the e5-pawn is practically doomed. 45...<af4 46 fi.c4 g5? A bad mistake, but 46...fid7 47 -fixes was equally hopeless. 47 fi-f 8! 1-0 In view of 47-Hc7 48 Hxh6 mate. Since the bishops are particularly favoured by positions with an open centre, one key idea is to clear diagonals for them. Let's see one example. Example 71 J.Hellsten-I.Zaja Menton 2003 agonal where Black has no opposing bishop. 18.fi.d3Se8 The active I8...e5?l permits 19.fi.xg6 fxg6 20 £)xd5l cxd5 21 dxe5 and White regains the piece with a sound extra pawn. 19 e4l Now that Black's previous move left his queen undefended. White carries on with his plan without bothering about...£)g6-f4. Less promising seems 19 -fi.xg6 fxg6 20 e4 £>g41? 21 f3 £)h6 after which Black manages to maintain a closed position. 19...e5 Indeed, after 19...£)f4?l 20 Wg3 followed by 21.fi.bl, Black achieves nothing, and 19...dxe4?l 20 £)xe4 £)xe4 21.fi.xe4 is equally uninspiring for him. By 19..e5 Zaja creates some activity but also helps me in activating the bishop on b2. 20Wg3! Keeping the tension makes sense here, since Black has difficulties in finding a useful move. Weaker was 20 dxe5?! Wxe5, when the queen eyes both el and b2. 20...dxc4 On the natural 2O...Sad8 I had planned 21 exd5 exd4 22 Wxd6, transposing to a favourable endgame; e.g. 22...Hxel+ 23 fixel Hxd6 24 £>e4 4£xe4 25 Exe4 cxd5 26 White has emerged from the opening with a slight plus thanks to his bishop pair. He now prepares e3-e4 to clear the position for his bishops, in particular the al-h8 di- Sxd4 preparing Ae2-f3. 21 JLXC4 b$ 22 £fl Not 22 Wxg6?l bxc4 with complications. 22...We6 23 d5l White swaps a few pawns in order to clear diagonals for his bishops. My original plan was 23 dxe5 intending 23...&xe5?l 24 £id51, but after 23...&g41 the position seemed less clear to me. 23...cxd5 24 exd5 £>xd5 25 A.xb5 xc3 26 £xc3 Sed8? This leads to problems with the eSpawn. After the correct 26....&.C6 27 A.c4 Wf6 Black had more chances of survival. 27 Ac4l.Axes offered much more; e.g. 3O...f6 31 Sxds! 2xd5 32 jLxf6 recovering the material with interest, or 3O...g6 31.£bS! (I saw only 31 HxdS? ExdS 32,&xd5 Wxd5 33 f6 &'f8 and Black defends) 31.-A.c6 32 Rxd7 Axd7 (or 32...Wxd7 33 Wf6) 33 £xd7 Wxd7 34 Wf6 S*?f8 35 Wh8+ followed by 36 »xa8. In these lines the cooperation between the two bishops in the attack is striking. 29...Xxd5 30 Wxh5 Ec8 31 Wf3 e4? Returning the favour. 31—£)xh4? 32 We4 was equally bad, but 31...Rxc4! 32 bxc4 Sc5 33 h 5 £>f8 let the game continue. 32 Bxe4Bdl+ 33 &h2 With all his pieces directed at the black king, White obviously avoids exchanges. 33...<d6+34g3- h8? A tactical slip in a hopeless position. 35 g4l Black resigned. It has been said that a virtue of the bishop pair is that one of the bishops can be exchanged for another advantage Let's look at an example on this topic. Example 72 E.Bareev-S.Lputian Directing both bishops at Black's king. Kharkov 1985 Now any queen move like 27-.Wf6 just drops a pawn after 28 2xd8+ Hxd8 29 &xe5, so Black is forced to enter complications. 27...£d5 28 Wg5 Even stronger was 28.&.a51 Rd7 29 ExdS! BxdS 30 Wf3, establishing a dangerous pin.

This wins a pawn, but 29 2xeS! £>xeS 30 Improving the Pieces White is better thanks to the bishop pair and the weak d5-pawn. Bareev finds a simple way of increasing his advantage. 26 fixb3l xc5 27 &xc5 Hxc5 28 Hb7l The bishop pair is gone, but White has achieved a few other advantages in exchange: control of the seventh rank and a superior bishop. 28...Wa5?! Now White manages to trade queens, which will leave the a7-pawn more exposed. After 28...Sec8 29 Wb4 Wa6! 30 Wb3 faS Black had more chances of survival than in the game. 29 Wb4l Sec8 30 Wxa5 Sxa5 31 Se3! With the strong threat of 32 He7- 31..JZe8 32 JZc3!

Example 73 E.Mortensen-S.Kudrin Copenhagen 1983 White is planning a kingside attack with moves like.f2-h4 followed by e4-e5 or f4f5, but Black's next move changes the picture completely. 13..£xc3! White isn't interested in the a7-pawn, since he is close to achieving a decisive The...Hxc3 idea is a common guest in the Open Sicilian, one that can support various goals. It may enhance an attack on a white king on cl, improve Black's central control and, when the reply b2xc3 is forced, damage White's queenside pawn structure. On this occasion, it will leave Black with a strong bishop pair, control of the hl-a8 diagonal, and a potential passed pawn on the e-file. 14 Wxc3 xe4 15 $d3 in the game. 22...£)d5 23 £d2 e4 24 Wb3 e3 25 -&c3 xc3 26 bxc3 b5l Intending,...d5-c4. 27 C4 bxc4 28 Wxc4 £e4 White managed to stop Black's plan, but the bishop has now found another stronghold. 29>b3d5 3Oc3 With hindsight, eliminating the dangerous passed pawn by 30 Wxe3.xg2 31 Wf2 seems like a better choice. 3O...£d3 31 £>d4 Wb8 32 g3 £c4 33 Wdl He4 34 >f 3 £xd41 In exchange for the bishop pair. Black is able to grab a few pawns. 35 cxd4 Wxb4 36 Cbl Wd2+ 37 &hl Wxd4 38 f5 Se8 39 Bb7 We4l Simplest. Black soon converted his material and positional advantages into victory. In some closed and semi-open structures the strength of the bishop pair is not noticeably felt. This often happens when defects in the pawn formation have left the enemy knights with protected squares, as in Sasikiran-lljushin (p. 23) and Hellsten- Olesen (p. 24). Let's see yet another example on this topic. 15...£)xb3! Exchanging White's most active minor piece, thus securing the advantage of the bishop pair. 16 axb3 e5 17 £ie2 Wa8! A clever way of reinforcing Black's control of the hl-a8 diagonal. Typically after an exchange sacrifice of this kind, the opponent faces problems on the squares of the same colour as his absent bishop. 18 b4 Preventing e4-c5. Here and later, 18 f5 can be met by 18...d51? 19 c3 Sd8, intending...d5-d4. 18... f6 19 Sf2 e4 20 Sffl fie8 21 &h2 £f6 22 flgl On 22 Ilf 2 Black had prepared 22...&d5, and if 23 -&d2? then 23-.e4 followed by 24...e3.

This gives White the chance of transposing to a structure where his knights will outshine the black bishops. 16£xc5! Damaging Black's pawn structure and creating a blockading square on c4 for the knights. Even so, in such positions White usually protects this bishop from exchanges, and I probably wouldn't have played this without prior knowledge of the old game T.V.Petrosian-S.Schweber, Stockholm Interzonal 1962, where White proceeded in a similar way. 16...dxc5 17 &b5!

However, White has a much simpler option at his disposal. 33&b6! Ed8 34Wxc5 On top of his strategical advantages White enjoys an extra pawn. In fact there are many openings where one side deliberately gives up the bishop pair for different reasons. In the Spanish Exchange Variation and the Sicilian Rossolimo, the JLxc6 capture is a main feature, while jLxf6 is often seen in the Ragozin Variation of the Queen's Gambit, as well as the French Rubinstein Variation, to name a few. Black, for his part, has entire defences based on the....xc3 capture, such as the Nimzo-lndian and the French Winawer. And in many lines of the Benoni and the Slav, he is happy to give up his light-squared bishop by...Axf3. In positions where the owner of the bishop pair doesn't suffer from any weak squares or pawns, a main idea for his opponent is to "mess up" the game, creating threats with every move, that could eventually lead to a transformation of the position, protected squares for his knights, etc. John Watson investigated this subject quite thoroughly in his fascinating work Secrets of Modern Chess Strategy, and it is a central theme in Chigorin's Defence, as well as in a few other openings. Here is one example. Example 75 LSchandorff-J.Hellsten German League 1999 White has emerged from Reti's Opening with the bishop pair, without having made any obvious concessions. Thus Black needs to act energetically in order to avoid longterm inferiority. Improving the Pieces 13...6 b4! Indirectly attacking the e4-pawn. 14 Wc2 After 14 Bel?!

For the related exercises to this section, see page 315- Chapter Three Exchanges The exchange of pieces is an important idea at any stage of the game, one that can have a huge impact on the strategical balance. The following examples have been categorized according to the principal objective being supported by the exchange. However, it should be noted that sometimes one single exchange can support several objectives. Realizing a material advantage One of the first strategical principles taught to new chess players is that when you have more material, exchange pieces! Thus we are able to reduce the opponent's counterplay and simplify to an endgame, where the material advantage can be more easily realized. Let's see a few examples. Example 76 Z.Efimenko-R.Vaganian German League 2005 In this late middlegame position White is two pawns up but his king is rather exposed on al. Efimenko finds a technical solution. 34 Wd4! Forcing a queen exchange that will finish off Black's counterplay and produce a superior endgame. When carrying out such exchanges, we should be ready to return some of the extra material if needed, like the f7-pawn in this case. In contrast, the greedy 34 -&b3? failed to 34-Wc3+ 35 &bl Hxb3+! 36 axb3 Wxb3+ with a perpetual. 34..>xd4+ After 34.We7 35 -&-b3 Black's counterplay is gone, while 34...Wxc4? fails to 35 Wd6+ &xf7 36 Wxb8 Wc3+ 37 Wb2 etc. 35 Sxd4 £ixc4 36 Bxc4 &xf7 37 a4l Passed pawns should move forward! In the game, afflicted by heavy time trouble, Efimenko preferred 37 fle4?l, when Black could have put up some resistance by 37...Hd8! 38 Se2 Ea8!, hindering the advance of the a-pawn - Meyer/Efimenko. 37... e6 38 &a2 White wins by bringing up his king; e.g. 38..Eb7 39 &a3 &d5 40 Sc2 Ea7 41 b4

Realizing a positional advantage The previous examples showed how the realization of a material advantage was facilitated by exchanges. This also applies to positional advantages, such as the bishop pair (compare Miles-Sunye Neto, p. 86), weak points in the enemy pawn structure, a mobile pawn majority, etc. Let's see a few examples. Example 79 A.Kharlov-A.Villavicencio Martinez Linares 1997 happy to swap pieces since the weak d5pawn will make any endgame favourable for him. Black, on the other hand, should avoid exchanges and try to exploit the dynamic advantages of the isolated pawn, such as more space and the strong squares on e4 and c4. 12 £e3l A key move, in order to trade bishops before Black manages to play 12...£)f5. 12...£xe3 Black has no choice since 12...J.C7? loses material after 13 -&C51- 13 Exe3 £g4 14 h3 -S.h5 15 -&e2!

Example 80 S.Brynell-K.Moberg Gothenburg 1996 Evidently, the absence of minor pieces on the board has made it easier for White to increase the pressure on the d5-pawn. 21..JXd6 22 Sed3 Sfd8 23 c41 A typical tactical resource in the fight against isolated pawns. 23...h6 24 Sxd5 SxdS 25 HxdS A pawn up.

In a difficult endgame Black overlooks the opponent's idea. 31Wa3l Wxa3 32 bxa3 This structure, typical of the Spanish Exchange variation, is another case where virtually any piece trade clearly favours one of the players. Black possesses the bishop pair but also suffers from a defective pawn structure, in the sense that his queenside pawn majority cannot be easily converted into a passed pawn. Thus White's next move suggests itself. 11 £f 4! Depriving Black of the bishop pair, and taking the game one step further towards an endgame, where the pawn structure speaks in White's favour. For this reason, contemporary games in this variation usually see Black postponing or omitting...Af8d6. 11...O-O-O 12Sd2 &e7 Or 12...&xf4 13 Zxd8+ *xd8 14 £>xf4 followed by Hdl+ with similar consequences. 13 Sadi £xf4 14 2)xf 4 £f7 Brynell (who kindly supplied me with some comments on this game). 21 g4l Gaining some space before advancing the f- and e-pawns. 21...C4 22 £)el C5 23 f4 b5 24 )f3 4bc6 15 f3 A natural move that prepares f2-e3, but 15 Sxd8+!

In any case, even without this timetrouble blunder, he was lost in view of the inevitable £>e4(xc4)-d6. Of course there are also pawn structures where the simplifications tend to favour Black. One case is the Open Sicilian, where White, in the event of an unsuccessful attack, often ends up in an inferior endgame. Here is one simple example. Example 81 S.Bouaziz-VJansa Sarajevo 1979 By means of an earlier e4-e5 advance White gained some space and took steps to a future kingside attack. However, from a long-term perspective the e5-pawn is weak, while the queenside pawn structure also favours Black, whose pawn on b5 restricts the white majority. In this context, Jansa's subsequent play is easy to understand. 17...Axf3 Also interesting is 17-..b41?, asking the question of the knight; e.g. 18 £ie4?l £ixeS White is doomed to passivity and Jansa proceeds with the creation of a new weakness. 26...S4C5! 27 &g2 h5 28 &f3 Sa5 Winning a pawn. 29 &e3 £>xe3 30 Hxe3 fixa2 31 Hb3 aS Black soon realized his extra pawn.

Now White obtains a superior endgame thanks to Black's weak queenside pawn structure. Correct was 15-..Wc4!, sacrificing a pawn for counterplay with focus on the exposed white king. There can follow 16 £)xa5 (or 16 HxaS £}a6!, heading for b4) 16...Wb5 17 b4 £>a6 (17...f61? is another interesting option) 18 c3 c5l 19 dxc5 (after 19 bxc5?l £>C7 the knight on a5 is in trouble) 19...£>axc5 20 <bd4 2>d3+ 21 £dl (or 21 e? £)cl+ 22 &el £>d3+ with a perpetual) 21...Wa6 22 b5 Wb6 with excellent compensation. 16 &xd2 a4 17 2>el!

For the related exercises to this section, see page 317- Exchanges Eliminating key pieces In the previous examples we saw how virtually any exchange favoured the player with a positional advantage. More common, however, is the situation where one side is looking to trade off a specific enemy piece. The motivation can either be longterm (e.g. to leave the opponent with the "bad" bishop) or short-term (e.g. get rid of his most active piece). Here we will have a look at the first case. Example 83 J.Piket-J.Timman Dutch Championship, Amsterdam 1996 g6 14 xd7+ 'S, xd7 15.&xd7+ &xd7 16 fxe5.&.XC4 17 exf6! - Piket. 13 Wh5+g6 14 xhs Thanks to the bishop swap, the white queen now controls the whole h3-c8 diagonal, with particular focus on the weak e6square. 14...£}b6 15 fxe51 fxe5 After 15- xc4? 16 exf6 White wins a pawn, while l$...€jxe5?l 16 £}xe5 xe5? runs into 17 -&f4 Wh5 18 We6 with a strong initiative.

In the position above, White uses a small tactical trick in order to exchange his "bad" bishop for the opponents "good" one, which will reduce Black's control over the light squares. 12 &h3! £xh3 After 12...Jcf7?l the bishop on h3 is hardly a bad piece anymore, and it even helps White in winning a pawn by 13 'S'gAl White is slightly better thanks to his superior bishop and light square control.

Facilitating an attack Now let's move on to exchanges realized on a more short-term basis. When attacking, the exchange of the opponent's defending pieces can have a great impact on the battle.

27 £}g4 We7 Faced with the unpleasant threat of 22 e6 followed by h4-h5, Black decides to dissolve the tension in the centre. 21...dxe5 Now, at first glance, 22 £>xe5 seems natural, in order to activate the knight and maintain an indirect threat towards the rook on b8.

Example 92 V.Kupreichik-M.Taimanov USSR Championship, Moscow 1976 18...g6 Indispensable, but now the absence of the dark-squared bishop is strongly felt. A natural move that prepares 2O...Wd8 as a response to 20 h6; however. White soon finds new horizons for his attack. It seems that Black should have preferred the cold-blooded 19...C4 20 h6 f5! instead; e.g. 21 exf6 cxd3 22 f 7+1 xf7 23 Ef4+ &g8! 24 We7 Ed7 25 Sxf8+ Exf8 26 Wxd7 Bf7 27 Wxd3 Wxf2 with unclear play. Of course such variations are difficult to work out during the game. 20 Ehl! Now that the mating motif with h$-h6 and Wf6-g7 has been temporarily neutralized, Kupreichik directs his attention to the h-file. 20...Wd8 It was already too late for 2O...C4 in view

Here is a final example regarding the exchange of a defending piece. In order to make progress on the kingside, White needs to eliminate the defender of the dark squares, the bishop on e7- 16.&.h4! &xh4 Avoiding the exchange by 16...f6? leads to a disaster after 17 h6, while i6...Wc7? 17.xe7 Wxe7 permits the tactical shot 18.&xh7+. This is also why 17...C4 is impossible on the next move. 17 Sxh4 -&.b7 18 Eg4 In just a few moves White has managed Ill 22cxd3 Wxd3 23Sf4! Creating the threat of 24 hxg6 fxg6 2 5 Hxf8+. 23...*d7 24 Wg5 19*e2! Without queens the black attack would lose all its venom. Moreover, White's longterm advantages, such as his bishop pair and superior structure, would become more notable. Less convincing is 19 dxe6?l Hh6 20 h4 &xg2 21 *xg2 2te4 22 We2 Wxe2 23 £ixe2 xe6 with an inferior version of the game. White no longer possesses the bishop pair, and Black has an active knight on e4. 19—Wxe2 A clear concession, but the alternatives were even worse: 19...Wh6? fails to 20 dxe6 £xg2 21 &xg2 and the f5-pawn is doomed, while 19...2ig4?! 20 h3 Eh6 21 e41 Be8 22 JLcl g5 23 dxe6, followed by 24 xf5, leaves the black position in ruins. 2o£)xe2 e5 Parrying the threat of 21 £id4 with an attack on the f5-pawn. 21 21C3 8d7 22 f 4! Softening up the long diagonal for the bishop, as well as the f-file. 22...&g4 Black defends against the threat of 23 fxe5 and prepares the regrouping of the badly placed rook on g6. 23 Efel! Not 23 Edel?! £)c5 with threats at b3 and d3. Now 23— c 5?! runs into 24 h3 £ih6 Preparing 25 White is clearly better and soon won the game. For the related exercises to this section, see page 321. Facilitating the defence In the previous section we saw how certain exchanges had the effect of facilitating an attack. Now let's turn our attention to the opposite case: the exchange of the opponent's attacking pieces in order to ease our defensive task. One typical idea in this sense is the exchange of queens which, if successful, tends to ruin most attacks. Example 93 J.Granda Zuniga-F.Santacruz Pan-American Team Championship 1987 It is not difficult to guess Black's plan in this position: a kingside attack. Granda finds a simple, effective solution. Exchanges 25 fxe5 dxe5 26 Q}b51 with pressure on c7 and e5. 23—Sf6 24 h3 <£h6 25 &b5 Ec8 26 a7 26 b4 at once was also interesting, to keep the rook tied to the defence of c7. 26...Xe8 27 b4 Stepping up the pressure on the queenside. White enjoys a slight but enduring advantage, whereas Black never even got close to his desired attack. Another common target for the "defensive" exchange is the king's bishop, which tends to play an important role in many kingside attacks. Let's see two examples. Example 94 V.Simagin-T.V.Petrosian USSR Championship, Moscow If White sidesteps by 25 £a2, then after 25...£jd6 the black bishop becomes excellent along the bl-h7 diagonal, both for de-

Better was 27 J&f4 followed by Ebel, battling for the c-file. In the game White faces more problems on the light squares. 27...£>xe5 28 <dxe5 d7! A move with various virtues: it secures the knight from the g4-g5 advance, attacks the h4-pawn, and prepares another "defensive" exchange on e5. 29 Wf 3? This leads to a lost endgame. Equally bad was 29 £}xd7? Wxd7, dropping one of the pawns on d4 and h4, while 29 £)f3 Ec4, followed by...Eec8, leaves Black with a pleasant, though not winning advantage. 29...£>xe5 30 Wxd5 exd5 31 dxe5 £xh4 32 Ee2f6! 33 e6 After 33 £f4 Ec4 or 33 f4 fxe5 34 fxe5 Ec4 White loses another pawn. 33...fic6 34.e3 Eexe6 Black later won. As often is the case in such structures, the side with the isolated pawn aims at a kingside attack. Petrosian finds a great de-

Example 95 E.Mortensen-J.Adamski Copenhagen 1998 Here is a more complex example on the same topic. Structurally speaking, Black has a sound position. However, his king is under a cloud for the moment, with all the enemy pieces directed against him. 18...Wb6! An excellent defensive measure. Adamski prepares 19—.fi.a6 to exchange the powerful bishop on d3, thus reducing the potential of the white attack. The more indifferent 18...&C5?! runs into 19 £}f6+! £}xf6 (or 19...gxf6 20.xh?+! Sfcxh7 21 Wh5+ followed by 22 Ef 3) 20 exf6 JLxf6 21 Axh7+! *4>xh7 22 Exf6! with a strong attack; e.g. 22...gxf6 23 Wh5+ &g8 24 Wg4+!

Moreover, White already has to be careful with a knight jump to e4. Exchanges 27 JLcl Not a very appealing move, but on 27 £>xe6? Black had prepared 27— xe6 28 Exe6 £)e41 winning the bishop. 27...£>fe4 28 We3 Wd5 Thanks to his central control, Black is considerably better. Example 96 B.Spassky-T.V.Petrosian World Championship (game 1), Moscow 1969 With the opponent being short of direct threats, Petrosian launches a counterattack. 20 f Xg6? The opening of the f-file will merely help Black in creating counterplay. Preferable was 20 Abi Sa5 21 Wh4 with a slight edge - Geller. 20...fxg6 21 h3 We7 22 Wd4?l A strange mistake that lets Black improve his bishop. Better was 22 cxd5 £)xd5 23 Wxf8+ Wxf8 24 Hxf8+ xf8 25 2)c4 with an equal endgame. 22...C5 23 Wf4 £b7l 24 Edel Wg7 25 We3 d4> 26 We6+ Wf7 27 We2 Ce8 The queen's bishop can also be the object of the "defensive" exchange, as in the present example. Black has an active game and went on to win. 16...Af6! A strong move neutralizing the enemy bishop. Others, such as 16...axb3?, allow White to carry out his main threat: 17 f xg6 hxg6 18 JLxg6! fxg6 19 We6+ &h7 20 Zf 7+! with mate to come. 17 £xf6 Now after 17 fxg6?! jLxb2 18 gxf7+ Sxf7 White's attack proves unconvincing; e.g. 19 Hxf7,S?xf7 20 Wh5+ &f8 21 Zfi+ £if6 22 Wxh7 We7 23 Wh8+ &f7 and Black defends. 17... xf6 18 Wf2 axb3 19 axb3 Sa2 In the following example Black managed to neutralize the enemy attack by a timely exchange of an attacking knight. Example 97 K.De Francesco-A.Gipslis Passau 1997 White has just played £>d2-e4, with a focus on Black's kingside as well as the d6square. 16..JLxe4l Eliminating the strong enemy knight. In contrast, the indifferent I6...£}c5? allows the nice combination 17 £)f6+! gxf6 18 Wg4+! &h8 19 exf6.xf6 20 Wh41 winning. 17 £xe4 Or 17 Wxe4 g6 with similar play. 17...g6 Restricting White's light-squared bishop and ruling out a sacrifice on h7- 18 f4 After the departure of his knight it is far more difficult for White to launch an attack, and he has to accept a more positional battle. If 18 Hadi, then 18...Wc7 19 A.d3 Hfd8 with a balanced game. 18... c5 19 £c2 Wd7 20 Hadi Wc6 21 Hf3 £ia4! Now White's compromised queenside structure makes itself felt. 22 £aiHfd8! Avoiding 22...Wxc4 23 Wxc4 Hxc4 24 &b3 He4 25 Ac 2 with a perpetual. 23 Hxd8+ Hxd8 24Hd3 By swapping rooks White aims to reduce the pressure on the c4-pawn. 24...Hxd3 25 Wxd3 £jcS 26 We2 2>b7l Heading for a5 in order to resume the attack on c4- Despite White's bishop pair. Black has a more pleasant endgame. For the related exercises, see page 323- Reducing enemy activity Another objective of piece exchanges is the reduction of the opponent's overall activity. During the course of a game, the activity of each piece goes up and down. Logically, it makes sense to swap off an enemy piece that is enjoying high activity, and this is the subject of the following examples. Example 98 J.Hellsten-P.Lafuente Pinamar 2004 Exchanges 28..JIxc8 29 5cl!Hc3 Or 29-SXC1+ 30 i.xcl i.g7 31 i.b2, hanging on to the pawn. 30 flxc3 £>xc3 31 i.e5 White has obtained some queenside initiative in this isolani structure, but it is not obvious how he can make progress. A closer look reveals that Black's position is sustained by his queen, which blocks (and attacks) the isolated pawn, while covering crucial squares like d7 and c6. In this context, my next move is easy to understand. 24 We4l Challenging the black queen, whose absence would open up tactical ideas such as £}d7-b6(f6), as well as.f4 fighting for b7. 24 -£f4?l Xta8 25 &xb7 at once is less effective due to 25--&xd4 recovering the pawn. 24...6C7? In time trouble my opponent overlooks the threat of 25 -£tf4- Equally bad was 24...Wd8? 25 &f4Ba8 26 2>xb7 or 24-.-i.g7? 25 Wxd5 exd5 26 £d71 Ha8 27 £b6, while 24-Wxe4?l 25 fxe4 yields White an excellent pawn structure, with d4-d5 coming up. Finally, after 24-i.xc5 25 Wxd5 (25 dxcSl? is interesting as well) 25—exd5 26 dxc5 Sd8 27 i.f4 followed by 28 i.d6 White is also better, but this was Black's least evil. White returns material in order to create a far advanced passed pawn. 31...&bl 32 £>C5 i.xc5 33 dxc5 &xa3 34 c6 &b5 35 drf2 &f8 36 C7 &a7 37 &e3 Heading for c5- With a strong passed pawn and superior minor piece, White is winning. Example 99 A.Moiseenko-D.Yevseev Cappelle la Grande 2006 25 i.f4 Ha8 26 xb7 Now White is just a clear pawn up. 26...f5 27 Wxd5 xd5 28 Sxc8! Having an extra pawn I am, of course, happy to exchange pieces. Black has just played _.f7-f5?, unnecessarily weakening the light squares. Moiseenko immediately punishes his opponent. 26 £c4! An excellent idea. In the absence of the bishop on d5 it will be easier for White to attack the weakness on e6, and he also gains access to the c6-square. 26....&XC4 27 fixc4 Sf7 Both 27...f 4 28 We51 and 27...Sfc8 28 Wa2! leave the e6-pawn in danger - Moiseenko. Example 100 A.Miles-R.Byrne Reykjavik 1980 Here is an example from a later stage of the game. White is slightly better thanks to his space advantage and more active pieces. How should Black proceed? 29...Wa8? An instructive error. At first sight it seems logical to swap the active white queen, but as we will soon see in the game, it is in fact the white rook that poses the most danger to Black. Thus 29...Ed8! was a better choice, disputing the open file, and after 30 Exd8+ Wxd8 the black queen proves just as active as its counterpart. Generally in similar positions, the side with less space is happy to keep his queen on the board, since it can easily attack weak spots in the "open land" of the enemy camp, like d3, di and a4 in this case. Moreover, a queen exchange makes it easier for the opponent to exploit his space advantage with the king, as in the continuation of this game. 30 Wxa8 Sxa8 31 a51 -fi.f8 Black has no time for 31...Ed8? due to 32 Ebl! with 33 &c6 next - Shereshevsky. 28 Eacl Ee8 29 Sc7 Wf8 30 WeSl? Another good option was 30 Wxa7 Sxc7 31 Exc7 winning a pawn, since 31-Ua8 fails to 32 Exg7+ &h8 33 Exh7+ si>g8 34 Sg7+ &h8 35 Ef7l, and wherever the black queen goes, 36 Eh7+ decides. 30...5fe7 If 3O...1fi'd6, the simplest reply is to exchange: 31 Wxd6 £ixd6 32 Elc6! with a superior endgame. 31 Exe7 Sxe7 32 Uc6 &g5 33 h4l In view of the line 33 &xe6?? £>xe6 34 Bxe6 Wc81, it makes sense to give the king a little space. 33...2tf7 34 Wc5 2>d8 35 Ec8l Ee8 36 Wxa7 With an extra pawn and more active pieces, White soon won the game. Exchanges 32 £tf4 2e8 33 &f 21 The king is heading for e4 to protect the e5-pawn, thus liberating the other pieces. 33...g5 Being short of better options Black opts for active defence. 33—<£,f7?l followed by...&e7 would just expose the king to a check on c6. 34£)h5 Curiously, both knights are excellently located at the edge of the board. 34...6.7 35 &e3 f7 36 fifl+ &g6 37 g41 A move with several virtues: it secures the knight on h5, fixes Black's g-pawn on the colour of his bishop, and creates mating motifs. 37... h6 38 Ebl £d8 39 &e4 Very methodical. White is not in a hurry, and aims at advancing the pawn to a5, where it will deprive the black pieces of the b6-square. 45—Ef8 This loses a pawn but it was hard to suggest anything better; e.g. 45—a5 46 Eb3 £>b6 47 Sb5 and the rook enters with decisive effect. 46 2>e7+ &h7 47 Sxf8 £>xf8 48 £>f6+! &g7 49 £je8+ &f7 50 xc7 &xe7 51 <£xa6 £id7 52 4jc7 Avoiding 52 a5?? &d8 and the knight is trapped. Miles realized his extra pawn easily. Example 101 B.Avrukh-S.Grigoriants Russian Team Championship 2008 A well-known strategical principle is that the side with more space should avoid exchanges. We already saw an example of this in Hellsten-Brkljaca (p. 35). and here is another case from a popular theoretical line in the Slav Defence. Obviously such a king manoeuvre wouldn't have been possible in the presence of queens. 39...£c7 40 Efl &d8 41 2f 31 Creating some kind of zugzwang. 41...Ae7 If 41—Eh8, then 42 £}c6! intending 42...£)xc4 43 Sd3 £a5 44 Hd7 - Shereshevsky. 42 fib3 £d8 43 &c6 £c7 44 Ef 31 The rook quickly switches files, a typical method when working on several fronts. 44...6.7 45 a4l 14...&fd7 A sensible move, in order to swap the active knight on e5, something that would also free some space at the back for Black's own pieces. 15 d3! Having more space White declines the knight exchange. This has the effect of leaving Black's minor pieces rather cramped, in particular the knight on b6. fortoolong. 21Afl fife8? By undefending f7 Black allows a blow on the dark squares. 21...f5 was still preferable, although after 22 £ic51 £>xc5 23 dxc5 £sd7 24 fiedl White keeps the advantage. 22 £)e5! An unexpected return. Now it is difficult for Black to cover all his weak squares. 22...£ixe5 A lesser evil was 22...We7 23 £>xd7 Wxd7 24 d51 Wd6 25 £g3 e5 26 dxc6 bxc6 27 fiedl We7 28 ±f2 fib8 29 Wc2 with a clear edge for White due to the weak pawns on a5 and c6 - Avrukh. 23 dxe5 £)d7 23...Wxe5? 24 f41 *xf4 25 £g3 wins a piece. 24 Wxb7 £>xe5 25 -fi-g3l Now the tension along the h2-b8 diagonal is unpleasant for Black. 25... e7 26 £>bs! £b8 After 26...cxb5 27 -fi.xe5 the double pin is decisive. 27 Wxe7 fixe7 28 fiedl! Occupying the open file and preparing d6 in order to seize the dark squares. 28...fif8 29 £id6 f6 30 £xe5 f xe5 31 fixc6 With a sound extra pawn White won without any problems. 15...£d6 By vacating the e7-square Black solves the deployment of his queen. The more straightforward 15...fic8, preparing...c6-c5, could be met by 16 Wb3 c5 17 dxc5 xc5 18 &xc5 &xc5 19 £xc5 fixc5 20 fidl Wc7 21 £>b5 Wc6 22 O-O with an edge for White. 16 fid We7 17*b3!

Even so, Black should probably prefer this, since in the game his bishop on h7 remains out of play Exchanges option of castling; however, White doesn't have the right pieces on the board in order to exploit this. Example 102 M.Neubauer-O.Korneev European Championship, Warsaw 2005 Now let's see the "active" exchange in a more defensive context. White has just played 18 £}f3-d4 activating his knight. What should Black do about his bishop? 21 Ed4 g6 22 Eadl &g7 By now it is unclear how White can improve his position, whereas Black enjoys a long-term target on c3. 23 h4fic71 24 >e2 h5 Ruling out any attacking attempt with h4-h5- 25 g3£hc8 26 Wd2 b5 Also interesting was 26...b6 preparing...£>b7-a5 with increased pressure on c3- Now White is able to get rid of that pawn. 27 c4 bxc4 28 Exc4 < d7l Asking White to solve some minor tactical problems. 18...Ec8!

Example 103 J.Hellsten-J.Veloz Ambato 2009 as in the game. 23 -2-bs! A key move. Among Black's minor pieces it is the knight on d7 that holds most importance for the moment, since it controls the weak f6-square and blocks the passed d pawn. Thus White wants to exchange it. 23...a6 Practically forced, in view of the additional threat 24 g4. 24 £xd7 £xd7 25 £>c5l White prepares a future knight jump to e4 and supports the advance of the d-pawn. 25„.£c8 26d6!Ed8 Black couldn't play 26...Wxd6 due to 27 £)5e4 followed by 28 £)f 6+. 27 3e4 b6 After the alternative 27...f5 28 Wh41 (or 28 Wd4), preparing f6+, Black is also in deep trouble. 28 ih8 29 £ice4 Black has just played..._fi.e6-f5, offering the exchange of bishops.

Series of exchanges An interesting strategical idea is a series of exchanges that produces a favourable piece configuration on the board, for example good knight vs. bad bishop. In fact we already came across this topic in Sasikiranlljushin and Hellsten-Olesen. Here are a few more examples. Example 105 J.Hodgson-J.Sherwin Frome 2001 that, if successful, will leave him with a good knight against the opponent's bad bishop. 14 SfeSlSxeS If 14-S>df6, declining the exchange, then 15 f3 Sd6 16 Wd2 Wg7 17 Hael. slowly preparing e2-e4 with a pleasant advantage. 15 Sixes £d7?l Black does nothing to stop the opponent's plan. Better was 15...S)d6! followed by...Sif7 in order to challenge the powerful knight on e5. although after 16 Wd2 Sif7 17 Sid 3! White keeps some advantage, with f2f3 and e2-e4 as a future idea. In contrast, 17 Sixf7?l fixf7 would leave him with a rather passive bishop on g2. 16.xe4l dxe4 On I6...fxe4 White could react in the same way as in the game. 17 f 31 Clearing the centre in order to exploit Black's weaknesses in a more effective way, just like Sasikiran did in the aforementioned game. 17...exf3 18 exf3 By now the merits of the plan initiated on move 14 are evident: the knight is a giant on e5, whereas Black has ended up with a typical "bad" bishop. In a typical position from the Stonewall Dutch White initiates a series of exchanges Exchanges Example 106 E.Poliviou-J.Hellsten Patras 2002 18...Ead8 19 c5 £c8?l 19-.Jite8 seems more natural, giving the bishop some slight hope of seeing daylight. 2OWd2 Well aware of his long-term advantage, Hodgson is not in a hurry and slowly reinforces his position. 20...Ed5 21 Sadi Efd8 22 Wc3 22 Wxa5?l Exd4 with complications makes no sense for White, either here or later. 22...Wf6 23 Efel h5 24 £hl g4 This leads to new weaknesses, but it was difficult to find any active plan for Black. 25 We3 *h7 26 Wf 4l Creating the threat of 27 fxg4 hxg4 28 £>xg4- 26...Eg8 27 fxg4 hxg4 28 £k4l Now that the rook left d8 White manages to regroup the knight without losing the d4-pawn. 28...5.d8? A tactical mistake in a difficult position. 29 b6! We7 It transpires that 29...Sxd4 fails to 30 Exd4 Bxd4 31 Wc7+. Thus White wins the exchange. 30£>xdsExd5 31Ee5 Hodgson soon realized his material advantage. In a typical Sicilian battle White has just played the impulsive g2-g4, which gives me the opportunity to carry out a favourable series of exchanges. 15...e5l Deliberately loosening the d5-square in order to get a grip on the dark squares. 16 d5 Wd8! By maintaining the tension Black enables the later exchange of his "bad'' bishop on e7. 16....xd5?l 17 cxd5 ' 'd8 is less convincing due to 18 &e3 exf4 19.S' xf4 £)e5 20 gSl, restricting that piece. 17fxe5? This lets me fulfil my plan. 17 -&.e3 was correct, when 17...exf4 18.&xf4 £)eS, preparing...h7-h6 and „JLe7-g5, yields Black a pleasant game but nothing more. 17...6.5! 18 £e3 After 18 £>e3?l dxe5 19 jLc3 £)c5 White has a problem with the e4-pawn. 18....xe3+ 19 Wxe3 £xd5l Swapping off the last piece capable of challenging the black knight. 20cxd5 xe5 Black has reached his goal. The knight is excellently placed on e5. and it can't be exchanged. In contrast. White's bishop is restricted by his own pawns. Moreover, the g2-g4 advance has left weak squares on f4 and h4. In conclusion. White is facing a difficult defensive task. Gaining more dark square control and fixing the enemy pawns on light squares. 34 Wcl 2g6 35-2.fl If White abandons the c-file by 35 We3, then 35...Wc7 36 JLc4 a4l intending...a4-a3 to fix a future target on a 2. 35«»Wb6 The position is unpleasant for White, who has to parry numerous enemy threats. 36 Wd2 2h4+ 37 &g3 Or 37 hi 2f3 38 Wg2 We3 winning the e4-pawn. 37...Wgl+ 38.g2 Wai 39 -2.f3? White's first tactical error in this game proves decisive. However, after 39 h2 s£g7! 40 Wf2 We5+ his position was also hopeless. A possible plan for Black is to place the knight on f4, the queen on c3 and finally activate the king via f6 and e5- Any minor piece endgame is lost for White due to the bad bishop; e.g. 41 Wg3? s£f6 and the black king enters with decisive effect. 39...We5+ In view of 40 &f2 Wh2+, White resigned. Example 107 L.Shamkovich-Joe.Ben jamin Las Vegas 1995 21 Ec3 b5 Now my plan is to swap both pairs of rooks in order to avoid counterplay and obtain the strong duo of queen and knight in the endgame. But first, considering the colour of the enemy bishop, it makes sense to put the pawns on dark squares. 22 kel b4 23 Ec2 Ec8 24 Efcl Sxc2 25 Xtxc2a5 26h3h6 27b3? Another strategical mistake: White deliberately places his pawns on the same colour squares as his bishop. He also weakens the c3-square, from where the knight will be able to attack his a-pawn. 27 a3 was much better, avoiding these problems and enabling pawn exchanges, which tend to help the defender. 27...Wb8 28 £a6 Ee8 29 &g2 2d7l The threat of 29-. £ic5 forces the bishop to retreat, after which the second pair of rooks can be exchanged. 30 £d3 Ec8 31 Wei Uxc2+ 32 Wxc2 2ie5 33 £e2 g5! Exchanges In this closed position Benjamin initiates a favourable series of exchanges, with a focus on the passive enemy bishop on g2 a s well a s the weak f 4-square. 17...-&a6! 18 Eel not only for reasons of tactics or strategy, but even psychology - here it is unpleasant for White to have to consider...Og6-f4 on virtually every move. 22 fl If 22 Acl, then 22,..h6l, insisting on the idea of,...e7-g5. 22...Ob6 23 Oxb6 Wxb6 White's proud knight is gone and now he has to take action against the threat of 24-..Ha2. 24 Hal Hxal 25 £xal.ig5 26 £b2 Wa5 The threat of 27...Wa2 forces White to swap queens. 27 Wa6 Wxa6 28 £xa6 18...£xe2! It might seem strange to swap the "good" bishop but it is probably the other bishop that is worth more in this particular structure, thanks to the excellent cl-h6 diagonal. Moreover, Black avoids the plan of 19 <LJg3 and 20 Jii.fl with White trying to get rid of his worst piece. 19 Wxel &f8 Heading for the protected square at f4. 20 2>e3 £g6 21 &C4?! As we will soon see, the merits of this knight manoeuvre are merely temporary. 21 was preferable, when 21...£Jd7 22 Hal Hxal+ 23.xal leaves Black with somewhat less freedom than in the game, due to the pressure on d6. 21... d7! A move with two functions: the bishop reaches its ideal square on g5, while the knight is directed to b6 in order to swap its colleague on c4. The tempting 21...£)f4 can wait until a more optimal moment. In fact, delaying obvious moves (such as 21...Of 4 in this case) is a useful idea in practical play, 28.. JLd21 Before seizing f4 with the knight, Black activates his bishop. The inefficiency of White's bishop pair is striking. 29 &g2 Of4+ Another idea is 29...h5l? in order to separate the white g- and h-pawns, or fix a weakness on h3 by an opportune...h5-h4- There can follow 30 &f3 Of4 31 -&fl (or 31 h4 hxg4+ 32,4)xg4 g6 and the h-pawn has turned into a weakness) 31...*h7 intending 32....4>g6 and 33-h4. when White is forced into a very passive position. 30 Sfrg3 g6 Thanks to his active pieces Black is considerably better in this endgame, in fact only he can win. The game continued 31 h4 &f8 32 &f3 &e7 33 £c4 f6 34 g5+ &g7 35 £>g4 f 6! 36 Jlb5 &f7 37 -&C4 3>g7 38 £.b5 < g2 39 gxf6+ xtB 40 h5 £tf4 41 hxg6 h5+! 42 &h4 xg6 and the passed h-pawn later proved decisive. For the related exercises to this section, see page 327- Dynamic exchanges So far we have seen a lot of exchanges supporting different objectives, without bothering too much on which particular square they took place. In contrast, this final section is devoted to exchanges that alter the pawn structure. Such "dynamic" exchanges can have the effect of clearing files and diagonals (see, for example, 17.xe4 in Kramnik- Van Wely, p. 40; or 23 £}xc5 in Petursson- Lyrberg, p. 73) and creating weaknesses in the enemy camp. In the next few examples we will have a look at the latter case. Example 108 E.Bareev-M.Kobalia Kazan 2005 Black is a little better thanks to his more harmoniously placed pieces. How can he convert this advantage into something more tangible? Kobalia finds a strong idea. 24... h5l Deflecting the rook from f4. in order to weaken White's pawn structure by a later...£xf3. 25 £e3 After 25 Sf 5?! g6 the rook is in trouble, so Bareev prepares its escape to d4 instead. 25...WC7 26 Sd4 £xf31 27 gxf3 Sxd4 28 £xd4 2)f4 The exchange on f3 left White with a number of weak pawns, while Black obtained a powerful protected square for his knight. 29 £flWc6 Tempting, but the flexible 29...£)e61? seems even stronger; for example, 30.e3 Wc21 31 aS Wb3 winning the b4-pawn, or 30 £e5 £xb41 31 'i'xb4 Wxe5 32 Wxb7 aS with a slight advantage - Kobalia. The trade of dark-squared bishops is indeed beneficial for Black, since it makes his knight untouchable on f4. 30b51 Pawn exchanges tend to make life easier for the defender. 30...axb5 31 axb5 Wg6+ After the exchange 31...Wxf3?! 32 We3 Wxe3 33 -&xe3 £d6 (or 33...£>e6?l 34 £g2) 34 -fi.xf41.fi.xf4 35 b6 the opposite-coloured bishop ending is an easy draw. In the game Black wins the pawn under better circumstances. 32 &>hl mi 5! 33 We4 xh3 34 g2 2)g5 35 Wf5 g6 36 «g41 Wxg4+ 37 fxg4 2>e6 Despite the minus pawn. White keeps reasonable drawing chances in this endgame thanks to the bishop pair. Nevertheless, Black won in the end. Exchanges nent with weaknesses on c3, C4 and a4- 16Sdl?l This looks like an oversight, but Black is also better after 16.a3 0e8 17.b4 £)ac4 - Naiditsch. 16...£c6! By exploiting the pin along the d-file. Black swaps off the opponent's "good" bishop, something that will further enhance his light square control. 17 *g4 Axg2 18 *xg2 f5! Preparing a centralizing queen check to counteract White's kingside threats. The immediate 18...Wd5+? failed to 19 e4- 19 Wh5 Wd5+2OWf3 If 20 f3, then 2O...£)ac4 restricting the enemy bishop is a good reply. On the other hand, the careless 2O...e5? runs into the response 21 £)xf 51 Wxdl 22 £)e7+ with a perpetual check, and the same thing applies to 19...e5? on the previous move. 20...Zfe8 21 Wxd5 2)xd5 The queen exchange finished off most of White's activity, and now his queenside weaknesses have become more tangible. Example 109 P.H.Nielsen-A.Naiditsch Dortmund 2005 White has just advanced the queen from c2 to e4, unpinning the knight on c3 and preparing to meet the reply 14..O-O? with the trick 15 £ixe6!.xe6 16 Wxb4, while 14....e7?! 15 Hdl O-O 16 -fi.f4 leaves Black with a rather cramped position. Fortunately for Black, there is an excellent third option. 14...£xc3l 15 bxc3 O-O By giving up the bishop pair Black managed to quickly secure his king and, in a more long-term perspective, left the oppo- 22 b5 After 22 &b2 2ic4 23 Eabl Bed8! 24 JLal b6 the bishop makes a sad impression. 22...&C4 23 Sd4 Or 23 £ixa7?

Black went on to win the game. Sometimes the structural damage caused by the "dynamic" exchanges can be counter-weighed by other factors, as we will see next: Example 110 G.Shahade-V.Akopian New York Open 1998 In this double-edged position White has just played >d2-d4, offering the exchange of queens. Now i8...Wxd4?! 19 cxd4 would evidently help him improve his pawn structure, while 18...We??! permits 19 e51 dxeS 20 Wxe5 with an initiative. Akopian prefers a more active option. 18...C5!

After the text White is unable to stop the passed pawns, so he resigned. Just as a "dynamic" exchange can damage a sound pawn structure, it can also repair a defective one. In the following example Black used this idea on several occasions. swapping the active enemy rook; e.g. 27...Hxdl+ 28 Jlxdl 2>xf6 29 &f3 with just a slight disadvantage due to the isolated queenside pawns. At this point, the tempting 29- d5? fails to 30 f 51. 27..Jlxg4 28 flc2 fld31 Tying the white rook to the c3-pawn.

White possesses a compact pawn structure, but the absence of the f ianchettoed bishop has left him vulnerable on the light squares and, indirectly, to a kingside attack. Black, on the other hand, enjoys the bishop pair in return for his numerous queenside weaknesses. An interesting battie is to be expected. 13...£>d5l Salov exploits the dynamic potential of his doubled pawns in order to centralize the knight. This is similar to Shahade's Wd2-d4 in the previous example.

Black is a pawn down, but his active pieces provide ample compensation. Chapter Four Pawn Play The play with pawns fulfils a whole range of functions in chess. In the previous chapters we came across some of them, such as the opening of files (Garcia Palermo-Bibiloni), clearance of diagonals (Sokolov-Nedev), and creation of protected squares (Vyzmanavin- Braga). Moreover, in examples like Guliev- Timman we observed that a single pawn move can cause serious weaknesses in one's own camp. In this chapter we will examine further facets of pawn play. Gaining space A fundamental function of pawn play is to gain space. We have already seen some examples of this in the previous chapters; e g. Seirawan-Sosonko (the g4-g5 advance) and Stahlberg-Taimanov (the...b5-b4 advance). By moving our pawns forward we are able to control more squares, and the space vacated by them often proves useful to the other pieces. In the following games we will see White gaining space on the three main areas of the board: the kingside, the queenside and the centre. These examples will also tell us something about how to exploit a space advantage once it is achieved. Example 112 A.Karpov-S.GIigoric San Antonio 1972 In a typical Spanish battle Black has just played...C7-C5, challenging the white centre. Karpov now initiates some alterations to the pawn structure that will help him to gain space. 25 bxc5 dxc5 26 ds! &a4 Pawn Play 30 Wc2 &c3 31 f 5! A key move. Karpov avoids the plan of...e5xf4 followed by...£>e5, and gains considerable space on the kingside. 31...6f6 32 £)e2 Swapping the opponent's most active piece and clearing the way for the g-pawn. 32... xe2+ 33 £xe2 £d6 Improving the knight and preparing 27...C4, followed by 28....c5, with a favourable bishop exchange. However, after seeing the game, one gets the feeling that Black should rather have taken some measures on the other flank. One try in this sense would be 26...g6 preparing...Ag7, although after 27 C41 b4 28 £\b3, with ideas like £ias and a2-a3, White keeps the initiative. 34 g41 Of course. With the centre completely closed, nothing speaks against a massive pawn advance on the kingside. 3 4...&f81 A clever defence. The king escapes from potential dangers on the kingside, just like in Zherebukh-Salem (p. 83). 35 h4 &e7 36 g5 hxg5 37 hxg5 2)d7 38 £g4l A typical theme when gaining space: the squares vacated by the advancing pawn are of immediate interest to its fellow pieces. In fact we already saw this happen in Hellsten-Berrocal with 32 Wd5 (p. 91). From now on Black will have to be on his guard against an opportune f5-f6, and this explains his next move. 38..J2g8 39 &f 2 Preparing Hhl in order to dispute the open file. 39...Bh8 27 C4l Preventing Black's plan and strengthening the centre. 27...b4 28 fif 1! Now that the tension has dissolved in the centre, White can start concrete action on the kingside.

However, this move also reduces Black's queenside control, something that Karpov immediately exploits. 44&b3!*C7 45 &f3l Clearing the second rank for the major pieces and producing an attack on the c5pawn. 45... d7 The queen joins the attack with tempo. 5O..JSxg4 Desperation, but SO...Ehh8 permitted 51 Wa5+ 'S'c8 52 f 6! gxf6 53 £>xc5 and Black's defence finally cracks. 51 *xg4 &c8 52 Wa5+ 1-0 In view of the line 52...Eb6 53 £)xc5!.xc5 54 Hxb6 Jlxb6 55.xb6+ £}xb6 56 C5- In the previous example Karpov firmly advanced his kingside pawns, exploiting the fact that the blocked centre had left the opponent without counterplay. However, in many other pawn structures such a pawn advance would have jeopardized the king's safety. In comparison, a pawn advance on the queenside is a much less risky affair, and it appears with great frequency in practice. Here is one example. Example 113 G.Kasparov-S.Martinovic Baku 1980 46a3l A typical method in positions with a space advantage - open a second front. Now Black is too cramped to be able to de-

Sc8 30 Wxc8! Wxc8 31 5d8+ Black resigned. A common situation for a pawn expansion is when the opponent's king is being attacked. Let's see one example. Example 115 M.Adams-O.Renet Cannes (team rapid) 1992 In the opening Black was forced to define the destiny of his king much earlier than desired, and White can proceed with a full-scale attack. In less than ten moves White's pawn centre has made remarkable progress, and he is now ready to convert it into a decisive passed pawn. 23...Wc8 After 23->d8 24 dxe7 Wxe7 25 Hd7 We8 26 Exa7 Se5 27 lS'c4, with ideas like Wc7 and.ds. the situation is desperate for Black. 24 dxe7 Not 24 d7?!

But 13-..exf51? 14 exf5 xd4 15 £>xd4 itd? followed by 16...Jlc6 might have been a lesser evil, with a difficult though not yet lost game. 22 xe5 dxe5 23 hxg6fxg6 24f7+&h7 Or 24...&h8 25 Ef6* a5 26 &bl £)xc2 27 Hxg6 £ia3+ 28 &C1 and wins - Adams. 25 -S.h5!

Black resigned. An important idea when possessing a space advantage is the opening of a second front. This is similar to the famous endgame principle of "two weaknesses", just that there are more pieces on the board. Typically the new front is opened by a pawn, like Karpov's 46 a 31 against Gligoric (p. 134). Here is one more example. 14g5 d7 Or 14...£jh5 15 f6.f8 16 Wg2, followed by.&.xh5, and White breaks through. 15f6£f8 16 h41 Of course. White intends simply to open the h-file and give mate. 16... de5 17 Wh3 b$ 18 h5 Even swifter was 18 £ixc6!, deflecting one of the black defenders before carrying on with the attack. Now both i8...Wxc6 19 h5 and 18...< xc6 19 h5 b4 20 Sdfll, preparing 21 hxg6 hxg6 22 f7+, lead to an immediate win. 18...b4 19 axb4 &xb4 20 Hdfl! Installing the threat of 21 hxg6 hxg6 22 f7+.

Example 116 V.KuporosovA.Panchenko Budapest 1991 White is much better, thanks to his Pawn Play space advantage, control of the only open file and the strong bishop on d6. However, a mechanical doubling of rooks by Rd3 and Sedl might not yield much after...Sa7-d7 followed by...Hed8. Kuporosov finds a stronger option.

At first sight it seems illogical to close the h-file, thus ruling out a direct attack.

Here I am referring to pawn advances that soften up squares or pawns in the enemy camp. Let's start by examining a few examples where the focus lies on potentially weak squares. 30... f8 Leko overprotects his weaknesses at g6 and e6, and prepares 31..Sc8 in order to swap the active white rook. 31Wf4 By attacking the knight on d6 White prevents...Be8-c8.

However, an immediate assault with 30 Wf4? backfires after 3O...e51 31 dxeS fxe5. Ivanchuk finds a more controlled way to proceed. 30 h4! Opening a new front on the kingside.

Example 121 P.Svidler-A.Motylev European Club Cup, Ohrid 2009 23 h6! A key move that softens up a whole complex of dark squares.

In the following play, Svidler exploits these factors to a maximum. 26 h41 Preparing h4-h5 to soften up the g6pawn. 26...5f7 Motylev prepares 27...fie7 in order to activate his rook. The more restrictive 26...h5 permits 27 g4'? intensifying the attack; e.g. 27...fih8? 28 We4 and the g6-pawn can't be covered properly, or 27...hxg4 28 fibs! €ic6 (after 28... b6? 29 Wxg4 f5 30 ExfS White wins a pawn) 29 Wxg4 &e5 30 dxeS ®xd3 31 Sxb7 xc3 32 e6 with some initiative for White. move, but this gives White the opportunity to bring his rook into the attack. Preferable was 29...Wd6!?, insisting on the queen exchange, when 30 f4 is well met by 3O...We6! 31 hxg6 We3+ - Golubev. Thus 30 h4, keeping up the pressure, is probably a better choice. 30fib5l The beginning of quite an unusual and very strong manoeuvre. The rook is swung to the h-file where it will enhance the white attack. Meanwhile, the check on el is harmless. 30...b6 31 hxg6 hxg6 32 Sh51 fie8?! After 32...< b7 33 Sh3! f5 34 h4 White also has strong pressure, but the text practically loses a pawn. 33fih3!

Now after 34...'®'xf5 35 Wxc7+ Black loses his queen, e.g. 35...&f6 36 Hf3 or 35.. Wf7 36fih7+!. 34.. -2)c6 35 £d3 Se6 36 Wh4 Wg8 37 -£c4!

But 27-..f5l?, blocking that same diagonal, is quite reasonable, when 28 1&d2 preparing 29 WgS keeps some initiative. 28Wg4We6 29Wg3 Wf7?l A logical follow up to the previous simple 32 Jfc.xg7l? £*xg7 33 h5 looks just as strong. No matter how Black reacts, he ends up with severe weaknesses; e.g. 33 -g5 34 Se5! h6 35 Wg6+, or 33...£)f6 34 hxg6 hxg6 35 BeSl, heading for g5. Also after 33-.gxh5 34 Wf3 £f6 35 He5! h6 36 Wf4l, with the threat of 37 Ug5+, White's attack is decisive. 32...Wd7 33 £g5+ *g8 34 £xg7 xg7 Or 34...Wxg7 35 JZxe6 with a technical win. Often a pawn advance is directed at a pawn minority in the opponent's camp, where it can cause both weak squares and pawns. Here are two examples that feature such "majority'' attacks, the first one on the kingside and the second on the queenside. Example 122 Pr.Nikolic-L.Van Wely Groningen 1993 35He5l Nikolic prepares the doubling ofthe major pieces on the e-file, with the rook in front. Thus this piece also gets closer to Black's king. Anyway, the straightforward 35 h51? was again very strong. 35...h6 36 2ie4 e7 37 We2 a4 38 £>c5 Sk7 39We41 Unfortunately for Black, the c6-pawn can only be saved by removing the queen from the kingside defence. 39...Wd6 40h5l Finally! Now Black is completely helpless. 40...gxh5 Obviously 4O...g5 fails to 41 Wg6+. 41 Hxh5 Hf8 42 Wg4+ &h7 43 ®e4l In view of 43--We7 44 £}g5+, Black resigned. White is clearly better thanks to the opponent's numerous weaknesses. In order to increase the pressure, Nikolic resorts to a typical pawn advance. 29g3l Preparing h4-h5 to soften up the black kingside pawns. 29...a5 Van Wely intends..a5-a4 securing his queenside, but the immediate 29-.Jfc.g7, taking care ofthe other flank, seemed more relevant. 30 h4l &g7 3O...a4?l runs into 31 h5 gxh5 32 He5l with a strong attack, now that 32-.Jfc.xe5? 33Hxf7 '&xf7 34Wxh7+leadsto mate. 31Sxf7£>xf7 32&e4l A tempting knight manoeuvre, but the Pawn Play nal, while after 13...key 14 £>b3 Eb8 15 axb6 Wxb6 16 £>d41 White keeps the initiative; e.g. 16....a8 17 Wa4+! or 16.-S.d7 17 JLe3l- Thus 13...bxa51 14 2ib3 Eb8 15 £ixa5 jLa8 was Black's safest choice, when 16 JLd2!? (not 16...Sxb2? 17 -S.c3 followed by e4-e5) 17 b4 O-O, followed by...5fc8, leaves him just slightly worse due to the weak a6-pawn. 14 axb6 Inferior was 14 £}b3?l bxa5 15 £)xa5.a8, transposing to the previous note. 14... xb6 Example 123 V.Salov-A.Karpov Wijk aan Zee 1998 In a typical Hedgehog position Black is somewhat behind in development. Thus Salov hurries to attack him in his most vulnerable area, the queenside. 11 a4! Preparing a4-a5 to soften up the a5square and the a6-pawn. This plan goes well with the deployment of the knight on d2, who can join the attack via b3-a5. U...£k6 After n..Xbbd7?! 12 a5, preparing £>2b3-a5, Black is already under pressure; e.g. 12.—S.e7 13 &2b3 Ed8 14 axb6 £}xb6 15 £>a5 -fia8 16 £}ac61, as in the game U.Bbnsch-V.Chuchelov, Berlin 1996, which continued 16....xc6 17 £ixc6 Wxc6 18 e5 Wxc4 19 exf6 &xf6 20.e3 with a strong initiative. 12 £>xc6&xc6 Also after 12...Wxc6 13 a 5! b5 14 cxb5 WxbS 15 Sa31, preparing Sb3, Black's queenside becomes exposed. 13 a51Eb8 One of several unsatisfactory replies. 13..b5?l 14 cxb5.xb5? 15 e51 was termi- 15Ee3l A key move that prepares 16 Sb3, after which the weakness on a6 will be strongly felt. 15...6d7 The knight joins the queenside defence. After 15.-S.e7? 16 Eb3 Wc7 17 Exb8+ Wxb8 18 e 51 White wins a piece. 16Eb3 a7 17 Sba3 Perhaps 17 Exb8+£ixb8 18 b41 was even stronger; e.g. 18...Wb6 19 b51 axb5 20 cxb5.S.xb5? 21 Ebl winning, or 18....S.e7 19 b5.S.b7 20 b3 O-O 21 JLe3 Wa8 22 c5 with a clear advantage - Salov. 17....b7 If 17...£>c5 then 18 £)b3! is unpleasant, e.g. 18... xb3 19 Sxb3 Sxb3 20 Wxb3.S.e7 21 Wa2! Jl.b7 22 Wa4+1, harassing the black king. 18 b41 The pawn joins the attack on a6, which forces Black's reply. 18...Wb6 19 Wa4l Defending b4 and complicating Black's castling. 19....e7 20 £.b2.f6? The weakening 20...e5 was Black's last chance. After 21 f1 o-o 22 £ie3 White is strategically much better, but in the game he wins material. 21 e5! A strong blow that liberates the c-pawn. 21...£xe5 Or 21...£.xg2 22 exf6.c6 23 fxg71 Sg8 24 Wc2 and wins, while 21...dxe5 22 c5 is similar to the game. 22 C5 C7 Both 22...dxc5? 23 £xe5 and 22. Wb5 23 Wxb5 axb5 24 £.xe5 £>xe5 25 -&xb7 Sxb7 26 Ha8+ are terminal. 23 & xe5 dxe5 24.xb7 Sxb7 25 c6 &b6 26 Wxa6#xc6 By a series of "only moves" Karpov has managed to stay alive, but White's next leaves him helpless. 27 £)C41 With the double threat of 28 < a5 and 28 Wxb7 Wxb7 29 £id6+. Obviously 27...Wxc4 fails to 28 Wxb7. 27-..Kb8 28 &xb6 O-O In view of 28...Exb6 29 Wa8+ or 28...Wxb6 29 Wxb6 Sxb6 30 Ha8+, Black has to accept losing a piece. 29 £k4 We4 30 JXe3 Wd5 31 £>xes Hfc8 32 Wd3 Black resigned. Another typical target for the pawn advance is an enemy pawn majority. Such "minority'' attacks can take place in many different structures, and in fact we already came across two of them in Psakhis-Drasko (p. 123) and Bouaziz-Jansa (p. 101). Here are a few more examples. Example 124 R.Cifuentes Parada-G.Milos Santiago 1989 At first sight the position seems rather level, but Black has a simple idea at his disposal, one that will soon yield him the upper hand. 26...a51 Initiating a minority attack. 27 Adla4 White is faced with a typical dilemma: if he swaps on a4 then the c4-pawn becomes vulnerable, whereas if he doesn't, then Black's...a4xb3 will fix a weakness on b3. 28Wd3 Cifuentes opts for the latter, aware that after 28 bxa4?! Wa6 29 &.e2 Sxa4 he would have two weaknesses to look after. 28...axb3 29 axb3 From now on Black has a slight but enduring advantage thanks to the weak b3pawn. Moreover, he is first to exploit the open a-file. Pawn Play 29... Wb7+ 30 f3 Or 30 Ji.f3 Wa7 heading for a3 - Milos. 30...Ea8! 31 -&-C2 Ea2 32 Wc3 Wa8 Preparing...'Wa3-b2 in order to swap the defender on c3. 33 £.di Sal 34 &.e2 Ea3 35 Hb2 If 35 -&.dl, then 35... g4l, with the double threat of 36...Exc4 and 36...£)e5. 35-Eb6!

Example 125 A.Beliavsky-A.Yusupov USSR Championship, Moscow Here is the Carlsbad structure, usually produced by the Exchange Variation of the Queen's Gambit, and where the ''classical" minority attack takes place. This subject has been extensively covered in chess literature, so I will limit myself to the present example. 12 a3 Beliavsky prepares b4-b5 to soften up the black queenside pawns. Also possible is 12 Eabl with the same intention; e g. 12...a5 13 a3, preparing b2-b4. Even the radical 12.xf6.xf6 13 b4 has been seen in practice. 12... 6d7 This structure implies a certain space disadvantage for Black, so generally he is happy to swap pieces. Milov prepares... >e5-c6-b4, exploiting the weak b4-square. 4O...Wel?l 41 Ebl is less constructive. 41 Ebl? Handing over the second rank. 41 f 4 was correct, preventing Black's plan, who could consider 41...£rf6 42.£_f3 e51?, preparing...e5-e4. 41...Ea2l 42 Exal Obviously 42 Wdl?? failed to 42...fixe2+ 43 &fl Wa2. 42...Exc2 43 &f2 £>5 44 Ea4? After 44 &el Sb2 or 44 Ebl #id3+ 45 4?fl &b4 White also faces an uphill struggle, but now he unexpectedly loses his bishop. 44...6.3+! 45 &fl Eici 46.dl fih2l 13.xe7 For the same reason, 13 Lf4 is more popular in today's practice. 13...Wxe7 14 b4 £>g6 Yusupov searches for activity on "his" flank. In the event of 14...Wf6, with the threat of i5..JLxh3, White could play 15 £)h2 intending 15...£)g6?! 16f41 - Beliavsky, with 17 f5 to follow. 15fifcl Before taking concrete action White mobilizes his last piece. In contrast, the straightforward 15 b5?l permits 15...C5! with counterplay. In a future structure with an isolated queen's pawn, the premature b4-b5 advance yields Black a protected square on c5- 15...Wf6 16 «dl since after a later a3-a4 followed by b4-b5, by capturing...a6xb5 Black gets rid of a potentially weak pawn on the a-file. Finally, the typical resource 16...b5?l, intending...£)b6-c4, is less appropriate here due to 17 a41 a6 18 a5, preventing Black's idea and preparing Ea2-c2 with pressure on c6. 17b5l Hurrying with the minority attack, exploiting the fact that without a bishop on e6, the reply 17...C5? would leave the d5pawn undefended. 17...Axd3 18 Wxd3 2)b6 Yusupov reinforces his queenside de-

Regrouping the knight to d2, where it will control c4 and at the same time assist in the kingside defence. 20...Eac8?l 2O...Eec8 seems more prudent, using both rooks in the defence; e.g. 21 Ea2 Wd6 22 Eac2 a51 23 bd2 a4, gaining some space on the queenside, with just a slight disadvantage. White parries the threat of 16....&.xh3 and clears the c-file for the rook at the same time. 16...Af5?! Although exchanges generally favour Black in this structure, he should have waited with this one, since now White achieves b4-b5 straight away. Preferable was 16...Eac8, intending 17 b5?l c51 - Beliavsky. White could instead try 17 Ha21? followed by Hac2 before pushing b4-b5. Also 16...a6 would be better than the text, 21Ea2l White enables Sac2 with increased pressure on the c6-pawn, and also removes the rook from the vulnerable al-h8 diagonal. In contrast, the natural 21 £>bd2?l Pawn Play would have run into 21...C51, when Black frees himself by tactical means. 21...£)h4 After 21...&C4 22 £>bd2 the knight can't stay on c4 anyway, so Yusupov instead activates the other knight. 22 <bxh4 Avoiding 22 £>e5? c51 and Black again solves all his problems. 22...Wxh4 23 &d2 He6 24 Hac2 e7 Meeting the threat of £)f3-e5 in advance. 24 -Eg6?! 25 £>f3 Wxh3?? is too optimistic due to 26 Wxg6!. 25 HcS If 25 £rf3?l then 25-..£)c4 is a little annoying, so Beliavsky prefers to activate his major pieces. 25...HC7 26 tib3 wd6?! 26...g6 was more sensible, avoiding any back rank problems and thus preventing White's idea on the next move. 27 2)f 3! 28£)e5l&xc5 Both 28...£)b6 29 C)xc6, followed by 30 £}b4, and 28...£)xe5 29 Wb8+ Wf8 30 Wxc7 £)d3 31 Exc6 £>xcl 32 Hxcl are equally disastrous. 29 Wb8+ Wf8 30 Wxc7 f6 31 £>xc6 £>d3 32 SbiEe8 33 >xa7 In this desperate position. Black lost on time. Other openings where the minority attack plays a crucial role are the English with l...e5 (see Psakhis-Drasko) and the Open Sicilian. In the latter, Black often tries to push forward his queenside pawns, in particular the b-pawn. In the short term, this helps him to gain some space and dislodge the knight from c3, thus reducing White's central control. In the long run, such a minority attack can leave the white pawn majority restricted and transformed into weaknesses. Let's see one example from the Accelerated Dragon. Example 126 N.Short-G.Kamsky Candidates match (game 2), Linares 1994 Exploiting the tactic 27...£)C4? 28 Wb8+, White finally manages to improve his knight. 27...&d7? This leads to material losses. 27...f6 was correct, covering the e5-square and avoiding the back rank mates, when 28 a4! £)d7 29 S5c3 followed by £>el-d3 yields White a clear, but far from decisive advantage. As usual in this kind of structure, White's chances lie in the centre and on the kingside, whereas Black aims at counterplay on the queenside. A special feature in the above position is the unusual location of the black queen - on h5 she complicates a white attack but might also get exposed tactically. 12...b5l Kamsky hurries with the minority attack. Less effective is 12...a5?l 13 a41 or 12...a6?l 13 Hael b5 14 &xc6 £xc6 15 £d4, preparing e4-e5, with a white initiative. 13 fiaei The last piece enters the game. Both 13 £ixb5?! and 13 £>cxb5?l yield Black strong counterplay after 13...£sb4l 14 Wc4 a5 preparing...Hac8, but 13 £ de2!? b4 14 £ig3 Wa5 15 £>d5 might be more critical, when 15...6.d5?l 16 exd5 leaves the knight short of a good destiny. 13...35. The queenside expansion continues, now with the threat of 14...a4. Also possible is 13.b4 14 £*xc6 £.xc6 15 £>d5 £>xd5 16 exd5 £d7. In the game Kamsky gets a better version of this position by first clearing the a-file. 14a3 After 14 a4?l £ib4 15 Wd2 bxa4 White can't recapture on a4 due to the pressure on e4, while 16 £c4 Wc5! 17 &.e2 Wc7 leaves him without evident compensation for the pawn. 14...b4 15 2>xc6 This intermediate capture rules out the option of 15 axb4 £>xb4l? 16 Wd2 a4, although Black could also consider the simple 15-.axb4. 15...£xc6 16 axb4 axb4 17 &d5 £>xd5 18 exd5 £d7 After the smoke has cleared, the first fruit of Black's minority attack can be observed: a weak pawn on b2. Moreover, his own pawn on b4 has a restrictive effect upon White's queenside. 19 &f2 The strategically desirable 19 £d4 is met by 19...£b5! 20 Wxb5 £.xd4+ 21 <i>hl Wh4, when Black's superior bishop yields him a slight but enduring advantage - Ubilava. If White tries to avoid this scenario by 20 £c4?l, then after 2O....xc4 21 Wxc4 Hfc8 22 Wxb4 Eab8 23 Wa4 Wxd51 24 £xg7 <&xg7 25 Exe7 Hxb2 Black obtains an even bigger advantage. 19...2fe8! Kamsky is not interested in trading his sound e7-pawn for the weakness on b2. 20 Ebl Not a pleasant move to make, but after 20 c3?l bxc3 21 bxc3 Ea3 White merely emerges with new weaknesses. 20...Wf51 Black directs his attention to the c2pawn. Now 21 Wxf5?l.xf5 followed by...Eec8 is rather unpleasant for White, so 5hort declines the queen exchange. 21Wd2&a4l Challenging the defender on b3. 22g4Wd7 23&C4 Both 23.xa4 Exa4 24 Bfel h 51?, opening a new front, and 23 Wxb4 Ji.xb3 24 Pawn Play Wxb3 Eeb8, followed by....xb2, are equally favourable for Black. 23...£ec8 24 Wd3 24 Wxb4? lost a piece to 24...Hab8, but 24 b31? intending 24....&b5 25 xb4 -&.XC4 26 bxc4 Wc7 27 c5! dxc5 28 Wc4 was perhaps a better choice. 24...5.5!

Sometimes pawn advances can be used to cause doubled pawns in the enemy camp. Here is one example. Example 127 V.Bogdanovski-D.Cummings European Team Championship, Pula 1997 Despite the simplifications Black keeps a clear edge thanks to the weak pawns on c2 andds. 32 We4 Or 32 Se2 £.d4l, exposing White's king and preparing...Hc5. 32...Wxe4?l The prophylactic 32...£f8! led to the win of a pawn. 33XXxe4 f5l Gaining some light square control and Black has just played...Wd8-c7, attacking the eS pawn, but White has no intention of defending it. 13 e6! fxe6 14 e4!

We already came across this subject in several of the previous examples, such as Efimenko- Neverov, Pelletier-Sebag, Brynell-Moberg and Johannessen-Nakamura, to name a few. Let's see some more examples. Example 128 S.GIigoric-P.Popovic Novi Sad 1979 In this position from the Griinfeld, White enjoys a pleasant advantage. His pawn centre is intact. Black has not managed to create any of the counterplay characteristic of this opening, and he also suffers from the departure of his fianchettoed bishop. Without bothering about the a2pawn, Gligoric proceeds with the inherent plan of the position. 26dSl Creating a passed pawn. Usually passed pawns become stronger with each step they take, so this is a good moment for its creation, considering that Black can't stop a subsequent d5-d6. 26...exds? The following rook exchange will just leave the back rank more vulnerable to tac- 31 Wc4?l By 31 We41 White would have obtained a decisive attack; e.g. 31... c3 32 We71 Wf8 33 Wxg5+ 'i'hy 34 fld3, or 31->f8 32 Wg4 We7 33 &f3 f6 34 4 xg5! fxg5 35 fld$. In general terms, the side with a passed pawn is often happy to start an attack on the opponent's king, since the latter has fewer defensive resources available. 31..&C3 32 fid Wd41 The lesser evil, in order to avoid an attack. After 32...flxd7?! 33 Wc8+ &h7 34 flxc3 White soon wins. 33 Sxc3 'B'xc4 34 Exc4 Exd7 35 «fl This endgame is won thanks to the fact that Black's passed pawns haven't yet managed to advance.

Another structure that frequently produces a passed pawn is the one with hanging pawns. In the above position, if White was to move then 24 £>a4! would be an excellent option, keeping the hanging pawns at bay. But it is Black's turn, and he immediately proceeds with the creation of a passed pawn. 24...d4l 25 a4 The opening of the c-file after 25 exd4?l cxd4 disfavours White, since any future rook exchanges will weaken his defence of the back rank. 31...Exc3!

J.Dorfman-D.Paunovic Minsk 1986 27 d3! In order to facilitate the further advance of the passed pawn, Dorfman is ready to let all his remaining pawns be transformed into chronic weaknesses. 27... xf4 Any queen move lets White advance the a-pawn, while 27.Wxd3? 28 £>xd3 would just help his knight in approaching the queenside. 28 gxf4 Wxd3 29 exd3 £)e8 30&f2 Of course not 30 a6? £ic7 31 a 7 £)b5 and the pawn is lost. 30...f 6 31 -& b41 Heading for b6 to liberate the rook from the defence of the pawn. 31...®c7 32 Ecl Ea6 After 32...£)a6? 33 £d6 Sc8 34 Bbl White breaks through on the queenside. Thus Black's rook is obliged to take up a passive role on a6, so that the knight can block the b-file by...4bb5 if necessary. 33 &e3 <bb5 34 Bal &f7 35.&.C5 &e8 36 i.b6 White is speculating with two different ideas: enter with the king via d2-c3-b4-c5, or penetrate with the rook on the open g- or b-file. 36...£>d6 37 *d2 2)c8 White enjoys a strong passed pawn on aS, but for the moment its advance is being confidently prevented by the black rook and queen. Black would have liked to keep blocking the b-file by 37...£)b5, but after 38 Hgl f7 39 Sell £sa7 40 &c3 the plan of &b4-c5 proves inevitable; e.g. 4O...£)c8 41 &b41 £>xb6 42 Sxc6 and White wins. 37—<&'d7? 38 Sgi is also bad. 38.c5 e7 &h8 49 d8! c5 50 Sf7 and 47...2>xf3+ 48 &e3 £)gS 49 h7 £)xh7 50 Sxh7 lead to a quick win. Naturally, a passed pawn doesn't mean victory in every position, and it tends to lose some of its strength if the opponent manages to block it. Usually the best blocker is the knight, a topic we came across briefly in Mikhalevski-Ehlvest (p. 57). Here is another example. Example 132 B.Spassky-A.Karpov Candidates match (game 6), Leningrad 1974 39 Ebl! Using some minor tactics Dorfman manages to enter with the rook. Less convincing was 39 &c3?l £>g6 with a counterattack on the f4-pawn. 39... g6 After 39...Exa5? 40 Eb8+, followed by 41 Sb7(+), White wins material. 40 Eb8+ 7 41 Sb7+ &e8 42 £b6 Again securing the passed pawn. Now that the battle is no longer limited to a single flank, Black is practically lost due to his passive rook. 42... xf4 43 Exh7 e5 At this point the game continued 44 Kh6?! e4 45 Exf6 < xd3 and White's task was somewhat complicated, although Dorfman won in the end. However, the thematic 44 h4l, advancing the second passed pawn, was considerably simpler; for example, 44-.e4 45 hs! exf3 46 &e3 followed by h5-h6, or 44-. e6 45 h5 £>xd4 46 h 6! &f8 47 Eb7, when both 47...&q8 48 h7+ In a structure typical of openings such as the Slav and the Caro-Kann, Spassky proceeds with a strong advance that will clear the long diagonal and the central files for his pieces. 22 d5l cxdS 23 cxd5 Now after 23...exd5?l 24 Exds the pin along the e-file is problematic for Black, whose bishop can't move due to 25 ' 'xe8+. If he, instead, avoids this scenario by 23...e5, then after 24 d6 White obtains a dangerous passed pawn. 23...e5l Pawn Play - Larsen. Now 27....d8 can be met by 28 f 41 opening a new front, eg. 28...f6 29 fxe5 fxe5 30 £)c4 with pressure; while after 27...EC2 28 £k4 Bxe2 29 £xe2 £d8 30 a4 followed by.d-e3, or 27...Sc6 28 £)c4 b5 29 £)a5 Scc8 30 Bd5 a6 31 b4 intending £)b3-c5, White keeps some advantage. 27...£d8 28 g4 f6 29 &g2 &f7 30 Eel?! Usually exchanges favour the side with the passed pawn, but in this particular case they will just make it easier for Black to attack the d6-pawn with his king. More active was 30 Bfl!?, followed by f2-f4, in order to open a new front. 30...£b6 31 Eec2 Sxc2 32 fixc2 £e6 Now the passed pawn is more of a burden than an asset to White. 33 a4 a5 34 £a3 Eb8! Having neutralized the passed pawn, Black starts looking for activity. This apparently innocent move prepares the plan of....d4 and...b7-b5, whereas the immediate 34....d4?! was less precise due to 35 Ec7. 351Ic4£d4 36 f4 If 36 £k3, covering the b5-square, then 36...£>b6 37 Bc7 £xc3 38 Bxc3 2>d5! followed by...b7-b5. In the game 5passky instead tries to achieve f4-f5. 36...g6 37 £g3 exf41 Aware that 37...b5?l runs into 38 f5+ gxf5 39 gxf5+ &d5 40 Bc7, Karpov adjusts his plans and stops f4-f5 once and for all. 38 Sxd4 f xg3 39 &xg3 Ec8 Thanks to his more active pieces Black enjoys a pleasant advantage. Now there appears the threat of 4O...Bc3+. 40 Ed 3 40 Bc4? failed to 4O...flxc4 41 bxc4 £lb6, while 40 Se4+ £)e5 41 g 5 doesn't work due to 41...Sc3+ 42 g2 Bxb3, when both 43 gxf6 &xf6 and 43 d7 Sd3! let Black keep the extra pawn. 40...g5l Anyway! Karpov has estimated that, with the passed pawn being safely blocked by the knight on d7, he faces no immediate danger. 24 d6 After 24 xe5?l xe2 25 Bxe2.d6 it is White who suffers from a pin, e.g. 26 Edel £sxeS 27.xe5.xa3 and the d5-pawn can't be saved. 24... -f6 25 &d2 Spassky regroups the knight to c4/e4 and prevents the...e5-e4 strike. If 25 Wb5, avoiding the queen exchange, then 25-..e41 keeps the balance; e.g. 26 < d4 e3! 27 fxe3 Exe3 with counterplay, or 26 £)h2 Wg5l 27 Sd5 Wg6 28 JLxf6 £}xf6 29 Eddl Ed7 followed by...Eed8 - Karpov. 25...Wxe2 26 Sxe2 Ec8! Karpov distributes the small space at his disposal in a clever way. The rook doesn't just seize the open file, it also vacates the d8-b6 route for the bishop, which in turn enables the consolidating plan of...f7-f6 and...&f7-e6. 27#te4?! This pseudo-active move does nothing to stop the plan just mentioned; the same goes for 27 £)c4 b5 followed by,...d8 and...f7-f6. Instead, the flexible 27 f1! was critical The game ended 50 fibl fic3+ 51 f2 Ed 3! 52 d7 Hxd7 53 Exb4 Ed6 54 *e3 Ed3+ 55 &e2 Sa3 0-1, in view of the black king's entry at f4. In the previous example Spassky was right in creating the passed pawn, but later failed to exploit it. On other occasions, the creation of a passed pawn simply isn't the best choice in the position. Here is one example. Example 133 Z.llincic-Kir.Georgiev Cacak 1995 Ruling out any attempts with 41 fie3+ followed by g4-g5. 41 Ab2 b6 42 £d4?l White should have tried the simplifying 42 fic3 Hxc3+ 43 J xc3 xd6 44 b4, when 44-b5! 45 bxa5 bxa4 keeps good winning chances. 42..JZc6 43 £c3 Sc5 Karpov dismisses 43—Exd6 44 fixd6+ &xd6, transposing to the previous note, and keeps searching for a bigger advantage. Meanwhile, White can just wait. 44 &g2 fic8 45 &g3 ®e5l Now after 46 fie3 *&xd6 Black wins the d-pawn without having to swap his active rook, so White prefers a rook endgame. 46 £xe5 fxeS 47 b4? This active defence backfires after Black's reply. Correct was 47 l&f3 Hd8 48 14,e3 Exd6 49 fic3, heading for c8, with some chances for a draw. On the other hand, 48 b4? axb4 49 Eb3 fails to 48..JXf8+! followed by 49—fif4. White enjoys a strong pawn centre, but the opponent's pieces are well organized. How to proceed? 20 fibs?! Preparing d4-d$ in order to create a passed pawn, but as we will soon see, this won't have the desired effect. Preferable was 20 fibci £>a5 21 Wd3 with an equal game - Georgiev. 20...£>a5 21 d5? It was not too late for 21 fib4 Hc6 22 Wd3, saving the d4-d5 idea for the future. 21...exd5 22 exd5£)b71 47...e4l 48 fid4 Or 48 fie3 Hc4 with an easy win. 48...£e5 Now Black obtains a second passed pawn on the b-file, and 49 d7 fid8 doesn't change much. 49 Hdl axb4 Pawn Play A key move, that creates the threat of 23...6C5, and also keeps an eye on the important d6-square. 22...£tf5 23 d6!? is less clear, when 23...£>b7? fails to 24 Exfs! and 23...6C4 permits 24 £>g31 £>fxd6 25.xd6 £)xd6 26 Sbd5 with strong pressure. 23 £e3 Now 23 d6? fails to 23...&C5, while 23 Kb4&xd5 24 Sbd4 Wc6 leaves White without sufficient compensation for the pawn. 23...5C2! 24 2)f4 The natural 24 £>d4? failed to 24...&C5. 24... f5 25 £f2 27 wd3, covering the e3-square, was safer, when 27...Wc7 preparing...Ec3 keeps the initiative. 27...6.3 28 Wd3 Hxf2 29 &xf2 &xdl+ 30 Wxdl Wc7l After the departure of his bishop, White is suffering on the dark squares. 31Eb3? This exposes the king to a strong attack. White had to try something like 31 <&g2 £k4 32 Wd4 2>e3+ 33 &h3 Wcl 34 Wd3 with marginal chances of defence. 31... e4+! 32 fxe4 Wxf4+ 33 Wf3 Wxh2+ 34 &e3 Wgl+ 35 &f4? After 35?d3 Ec8 the white king has a hard time, but now he is mated. 35...g5+ 36 &f5 Wd4! White resigned. Needless to say, two connected passed pawns represent a tremendous force, one that often justifies material concessions. Let's see two examples. Example 134 E.Van den Doel-G.Guseinov European Team Championship, Gothenburg 2005 The dark sides of the plan initiated five moves ago have already become evident. Black's knight gained access to the fSsquare, and his rook commands the c-file as well as the second rank. Meanwhile, White's major pieces are badly coordinated. As for the passed pawn itself, it is not likely to advance in the near future and rather represents a weakness. 25...< bd6 A natural move to activate the knight and block the d-pawn, but 25-.Wc7l, with the double threat of 26...Wxf4 and 26...Hxf2 27 &xf2 c2+, was even stronger; e.g. 26 Sb4 Exf21 27 &xf2 Wc5+ 28 &e2 He8+ 29 Se4 Sxe4+ 30 fxe4 We3+ wins - Georgiev. 26 Sb4 Ee8 27 £4?! wins - Finkel. As for 2 3...£b7, the most technical way to victory is 24 fic7 £>hs 25 g31.xb2 26 Exb7 J&d4 27 &hl followed by a5-a6. 24 b6! Forward! 24...&h6 25 b7 &g7 A surrealistic attempt for counterplay, but 25...£>d7 just loses after 26 jLbS £)b8 27 Hc8+! - Finkel. 26 b8W xg2 27 fic3 2rf4 28 &c4 White soon realized his loads of extra material. In this Maroczy structure Black has just played...a7-a6?, probably expecting a further positional battle after 15 £id4 or 15 £)a3- White's reply must have come as a cold shower. 15 a41 Van den Doel alters the material balance in order to create a few powerful passed pawns. The next moves are practically forced. 15...axb5 16 Csxb6 Wd8 17 cxbs 4be5 18 Hxc8! Stronger than 18 C)xc8?!.xc8, when the black rook prevents the march of the apawn. 18..J?xc8 19 xc8 xc8 20 a4!

Example 135 J.Hellsten-E.Mohamed Malmo 1992 Here is a less violent case on the same topic. In exchange for the pawn Black enjoys a strong bishop pair, with pressure on the e3-pawn. How should White defend it? After 19 Wxb6? axb6 he loses one of the pawns on a2 and e3, while 19 fif3?l e4 20 Eg3 f5 yields Black a strong initiative. After some thinking I found a third, and much better option. 19 Sc3l Preparing an exchange sacrifice that A great move. Confident about the strength of his passed pawns, White is ready to give up a whole piece in order to exchange queens and reach an endgame. 21..&xe3 22 Wxc8+ £xc8 23 Eel £e6 After 23..&d7 24 b6! £xa4 25 b7 2)d7 26 Hc8+ £f8 27 b31 £xb3 28 £bS White Pawn Play will neutralize Black's activity and leave White with two connected passed pawns. 19...Ab4 A tempting reply, but with hindsight might have been a better choice. White could react by 20 hl f 4 21 ext 4 exf4 22 &d3, when 22...Ad4 23 £xg6! &xc3 24 Jlxh7+ &xh7 2 5 Wxc3 followed by £)f3 promises him some advantage. White wins. During the game I thought that 23...e4 was the best option, but after the simple 24 £)xe4.xe4 25.xe4 Sfe8 26 JLf3 Black remains in difficulties. 24 c5 Wd7 25 £)e4 By means of the threat of 26 £id6 White practically forces the exchange of the active black bishop. In contrast, 25 d6?l proves premature after 2 5—He6! with...Exd6 coming up. 25...£xe4 26 £xe4 f5 27 Ac2l The impulsive 27 c6?l permits 27-..bxc6 28 dxc6 >e6 with rather unclear play. 27... h8 28 e4 But now there was nothing wrong with 28 d6. I think that I choose the text in order to rule out any attempt with...e5-e4 followed by...f5-f4. 28.. JZf8 Here and later, 28...f4 is well met by 29 jLdll. 29 b4 20 a3 &xc3 21 Wxc3 Black has won the exchange, but the departure of his dark-squared bishop has made the pawns on c4 and d5 more dangerous. To start with, there is the threat of 22 C5. 21...Wd6 21...Sac8 22 Hci Wd6 23 £f3 transposes. 22£f3! Renewing the threat of c4-c5- 22 b4?l is less appropriate due to 22...b51 destroying the white pawn chain. 22...5ac8 23 Scl Not 23 e4?! b5! and Black again manages to undermine the passed pawns. 23-Sfe8 Mohamed finally accepts the c4-c5 advance, aware that 23...b6?! 24 b4 makes little sense; e.g. 24...SC7 25 c5 bxc5 26 bxc5 Hfc8? 27 cxd6 Sxc3 28 Hxc3 Sxc3 29 d7 and The rest is surprisingly easy. In the absence of open files, Black is unable to create any real counterplay with his rooks. 29-JZf 6 30 Sei Se8 31 Wd3 fxe4 This clears the f-file but also produces a weakness on e5. 32 Wxe4 g6 33 d6!

For the related exercises to this section, see page 334- Pawn majorities Many openings produce some kind of asymmetry regarding the pawn structure. One of the players obtains a pawn majority on the queenside, and his opponent one on the kingside, a situation already familiar to us from Hellsten-Brkljaca and Brynell-Moberg, among others. Such majorities can be converted into a passed pawn, and they can also support an attack on the enemy king. Let's start with queenside majorities. In the usual positions where both sides have castled short, a queenside pawn majority has two fundamental virtues: its advance won't expose the king, and a future passed pawn will be at some distance from the enemy king in the endgame. The latter implies that the side with the queenside majority is often happy to exchange pieces and take the game closer to the endgame. The following example shows the kind of position that he is aiming at. Example 136 V.Smyslov-LSzabo Hastings 1954/55 Thanks to his advanced pawn majority on the queenside. White has a big advantage. Of course its impact would be less strong with the black king on c7. 28...5.8 As long as the white rook remains on d2, Black's king won't be able to assist in the queenside defence, so it makes sense to exchange rooks. 29 fixd8 &xd8 30 f4! The bishop joins the battle for the queenside. 30...gxf4 31 gxf4 £ b3 Freeing the e6-square for the knight and possibly the king. Here or later, it probably made sense to include 31...a6 32 a4 in order to reduce the number of pawns, but that might not change too much. 32 &e3 The immediate 32 b5 was also possible, but activating the king is rarely wrong in the endgame. 32... f6? This lets White realize his pawn majority by tactical means. A lesser evil was 32...&f8 33 bS &e8, trying a different route for the king, although after 34 c6 bxc6 35 bxc6 £ie6 36 f5 GJc7 37 &d4 Black's task remains very difficult. 33 b5! e5 Desperation, but the intended 33...'i,e6 failed to 34 c6, when both 34-bxc6 35 bxc6 &d6 36 4hb5+! and 34-.&d6 35 b6! axb6 36 £)b5+ win for White - Smyslov. Pawn Play 11 bxc3 -&.a6 with a complex battle. 7 c4 White desists from a structure with an isolated queen's pawn and takes the first step to a future pawn majority. 7...Wd6 8&C3 a6 Avoiding a knight jump to b5. The alternative is 8...cxd4 9 ®xd4 a6, avoiding the kind of play that now arises in the game. 9dxc5! White obliges the opponent to put a piece on c5, in order to achieve b2-b4 with tempo later on. 9.. >xdl+ After 9„. xc5?l 10 'H'xdb.xd6 11 b4-r £ke4 12 £)xe4 £)xe4 13 c51, followed by.d3. White's pawn majority is already a main factor in the battle. 10 Sxdl £xc5 11 -&.XC5 £)XC5 12 b41 White takes the opportunity to advance his pawn majority. In contrast, 12.e2?l &e7 13 O-O b6 14 Sd4.&.b7 15 Sfdl Ehd8 led to a rather equal game in V-Parfenov- A.Eliseev, Moscow 2001. 12...6.e4?! This entangles Black's development.

Now let's see a complete game where White, at an early stage, heads for a battle with a queenside pawn majority. Example 137 S.Erenburg-A.Murariu Las Palmas 2003 Sicilian Defence (B22) 1 e4 c5 2 c3 The Sicilian Alapin is one of the openings that often produces a pawn majority on the queenside. 2...d5 3 exd5 WxdS 4 d4 &f6 5 4 f3 e6 6 &e3 A modern continuation, which puts some immediate pressure on the c5-pawn. Other frequent options are 6.d3 and 6 &e2. 6...2>bd7 More common is 6...cxd4; for example, 7 cxd4 &.b4+ 8 £)c3 O-O 9 &.d3 b6 10 O-O &xc3 13 £}bl! 19 Exd8 &xd8 20 &c2 £)b6 Black finally admits the problem with the misplaced knight on a4. Unfortunately, on b6 it obstructs the development of his bishop. 21 £)c3 &e7 22 Hdl £)g4 Not very constructive, but after 22....d7 23 £>eS.e8 24.f3 White is also better. 23 h3l Erenburg avoids 23 c5? £)ds! 24 £)xd5+ exds 25 Sxds Sa2+ with strong counterplay. Now the knight has to retreat in view of 23...£>xf2? 24 Sfl. 23...£)f6 24 &b3 h6 25 C>e5! Activating the knight and enabling JLf3- The latter explains why the bishop went to e2 and not d3 on the 15th move. 25...£)bd7 26<£xd7 £.xd7 An excellent move, related to the concept of "the superfluous piece" investigated by Mark Dvoretsky. Now both black knights are soon forced to less active squares. Tempting at first sight, but the knight isn't well placed there in the long run. Preferable was 13...&d7 14.&d3 £ief6 followed by...b7-b6,....b7 and...&e7. If White tries to avoid this by 15 c5?l, then after 15...aS! 16 a3 axb4 17 axb4 £>d5 the b4-pawn gets into trouble. 14 Sd4l The best way of dislodging the knight, since 14.&.d3 runs into 14...£>ec3! intending...a7-a5 with counterplay. 14...£>f6 15 £.e2 15...&e7 Obviously 15...O-O? would move away the king from the main battlefield, the queenside. White applies the same logic on his next move. 16&d2l aS Pawn exchanges usually favour the de-

The fact that White fixes his pawns on squares of the "wrong" colour and also cedes the cs-square isn't a big deal, since Black lacks space for exploiting this. In contrast, both 27 c5?l.c6 28 f3 £}ds 29 b5 2>xc3 30 &xc3 £ds and 27 &f3.&c6! 28 J.xc6 bxc6 lead to a smaller advantage than in the game. 27...b6? Pawn Play Rather natural, but now this pawn turns into a weakness. Correct was 27..Sd8 28 Af3 -&C8, when 29 Sxd8 &xd8 30 c5 produces a clear, but not decisive advantage - Erenburg. 28 £f3 Sb8 After 28...Sa7? 29 £ia4 the problem with...b7-b6 is well displayed. Thus Black has to surrender the a-file. 29 Sal! This move comes with two strong ideas: seize the seventh rank by Sa7, or attack the b6-pawn by Ea6 and a4. 29...£c8 Preparing...£}d7-c5- 3OSa7+£>d7 31 -£c6! Now White is ready to swap the defending knight at any moment. 31...f5 Since the immediate 31...?d6 fails to 32 £te4+, Black prepares it. 32 a4 &d6 33 £.xd7!

Example 138 V.Spasov-A.Dreev Moscow Olympiad 1994 Here is an example where the queenside pawn majority is realized in a slightly different way. 16 a3! Preparing the plan of b2-b4, 4ib3 and c4-c5 in order to advance the queenside majority. 16...b6 Dreev hurries to conclude his development. Obviously 16...a5?l permits 17 4 b5, when the knight turns into a headache for Black. As for 16...e5 17 £>b3 f5?! advancing his own majority, after 18 c5l followed by Jlc4+, the king becomes exposed. The attempt to improve this line by 17..b6 permits 18 c51, when White gets in first on "his" flank; e.g. 18...bxc5 19 £>xc5 £)xc5 20 Wxd8 Hxd8 21 &xc5 f6 22.xf8 &xf8 23 Hc7! with a pleasant endgame advantage thanks to the active pieces and the weak a6-pawn. 34 &b4! Active king. Now the threat of 35 xb6! Exb6 36 c5+ forces the black king to move away from the b6-pawn, and the rest is easy. 20 c5l A key move that converts the pawn majority into a passed pawn. 2O...bxc5 In the event of 2O...axb41? White can choose between the simple 21 axb4 and the riskier 21 c61?.xc6 22 Bxc6 bxa3 23 Wai, in both cases with a slight advantage - Spasov. 21 bxc5 a41 The immediate 21...ic6?! runs into 22 £>e5 £)xe$ 23 -&.xeS 2>ds 24 £)d4 with strong pressure. For this reason Dreev first 17 b4 -&b7 18 £b3 hf6 deflects the knight from d4. Improving the knight. After i8...Hc8 19 c5 bxc5 20 £>xc5l (fighting for the e5square) 20...£}xc5 21 bxc5 preparing 22 £je5, the passed pawn yields a clear plus. 19 -£-d4 Spasov prepares £)f 3-e5 to soften up the dark squares in the enemy camp.

Dolmatov suggests 19-.-£-h6!? intending 20 Sc2 e5! and the pawn is untouchable; instead, 20 Ibll? followed by c4-c5 seems preferable, just like in the game. 22 £)bd2 £c6 23 £je5!

In the same spirit as the 23rd move. 25...£xd6? Black underestimates the ensuing passed pawn on d6. 25....g71 was clearly preferable, avoiding the exchanges and keeping the pawn at c4. After 26 Kbl or 26 £k4 White keeps a slight edge, but nothing Pawn Play 26 cxd6 £dS 27 Creating the threat of 28 JLb5. The immediate 27 -fi.b5?l permitted 27. g51 28 g3 Hed8 with counterplay - Spasov. 27... f6 Giving up the blockade of the passed pawn, but Black was short of alternatives; e.g. 27... b6 28 Hc71? intending 28...Had8? 29 fixd7! Hxd7 30 2if6+. 28 xf6+ Wxf6 Or 34...Sxd7 35.&xd7 Wxd7 36 Ecl and the rook enters sooner or later with decisive effect. 35 Ebl Wb6 If 35....&b3 then 36 Wf6! followed by a timely Hcl. 36Eb4 £c6? A tactical slip in a desperate position. 37.xa4 c5 38 Zb8! Black resigned. How to fight against a queenside pawn majority? One idea is to create activity on the other flank, for example by advancing one's own majority, a topic that we will investigate after the next game. Another option is a minority attack in order to soften up the enemy majority, as in the following example. Example 139 V.lvanchuk-S.Karjakin Wijk aan Zee 2006 29 d7?! A natural advance, but 29 -fi.c41, challenging the blocker on d5 first, was more technical; for example, 29...Sed8 30.&xdS exd5 31 WxdS Ea6! 32 d7 Sd6 33 Ee8+ &g7 34 xd6! xd6 35 Exd8 We7l 36 Edc8 Wxd7 37 E8c41, followed by h2-h4, with good chances for victory. 29-£ed8 30 Ec7 Wb2?l While 3O...'S'e7? failed to 31 'S'xds, correct was 3O... Ff4! heading for d6; e.g. 31 'fi'cl d6 32.fi.b5.fi.xg2! snatching a pawn, with unclear play. 31 Wcl Wb6?l 31...Wxcl 32 Hexcl < f8 33 £bs &e7 was a lesser evil, with a difficult, though far from lost endgame. In the game the presence of queens inhibits the king transfer to e7. 32 Wf4 Ha7 33 Hxa7 Wxa7 34 £b5 Wa5 White is slightly better thanks to his bishop pair. Ivanchuk's following play is a model example of how to neutralize a pawn majority. 17 £e3 Hhc8 After 17 -b6?! 18 b4l cxb4 19 axb4 Hhc8 24...5.c8 25 Sal! Exploiting the semi-open file that was created by b2-b4. 25...6.6?! Surprisingly, this leads to a loss of a pawn almost by force. 25-Sd7 was a lesser evil, when 26 Shell Hdc7 27 Hxc71 Sxc7 28.&f4 Hc2 29 &e3 yields White a clear advantage - Ivanchuk. 26 £ a6! Again this pinprick in order to stir up the black defence. Now 26...Sc7? fails to 27 Hhcl Sdd7 28 &b5 etc. 26...Hb8 27 £ b5! The trade of the b4-pawn for the one on a7 will have a weakening effect on the remaining pawn on b6. 27... xb4 If 27..Sbc8 or 27...Hdc8, then 28 Hhcl with similar play. 28 Hxa7+ 3>g8 29 He7! Preparing Hal-a7, a threat that soon forces Karjakin to give up the b6-pawn. 29...Xf7 30 Hal Ha8 31 Hd7! Improving the rook before taking the pawn. Less technical was 31 Hxa8?l Hxa8 32 &xb6 Hb8! 33 Sd7 Hxb6 34 Sd8+ £e8 35 JLxe8,18 with more chances of survival than in the game. 31...Hdc8 Or 31....fce6 32 Hxa8 Hxa8 33 Hd6! &f7 34 2xb6 with a similar game. 32 Hxa8Hxa8 33 &xb6 Now in the event of 33...Sb8 White has the reply 34 Hd6. Ivanchuk later realized his extra pawn. Now let's move over to pawn majorities on the kingside. The advance of a kingside majority can have several positive effects, such as an attack on the opponent's king (given that he has castled short), the creation of a passed pawn, or simply increased 20 b51 one pawn stops two with a clear advantage - Ivanchuk. 18 f 3 A useful move that reinforces the e4pawn and enables &f2. In contrast, 18 b4?l is less suitable here due to 18...C41 creating a passed pawn. Advancing the kingside majority by 18 f4?l is equally flawed due to 18..JL c6 19 -&f3 f51 with counterplay. 18...£e6 If 18...b5, then 19 O-O-O! Hc7 20 Hd6 is very strong - Ivanchuk. There can follow 20...C4 21 Hhdl jLc6 22 g41?, preparing h2h4 and g4-g5 with a new front. 19 Scl b6 After 19...C4 20 < f2 b5 21 Hhdl White gets the upper hand; eg., 21...a5?l 22 f 41 f5 23.f 3, when 23-Hab8 fails to 24 exfS £}xfS 25 &a7. 2OAa6!Hd8 21 b4! After expelling the rook from the c-file, White launches a minority attack in order to eliminate the potential passed pawn and clear lines towards the black queenside. 21...cxb4 22 axb4 £ c8 23 £.e2 Keeping the powerful bishop pair. 23...6e6 24 sfef2 Also tempting is 24 b51?, fixing the black pawns, but Ivanchuk is not in a hurry. Pawn Play central control. The following example shows the kingside pawn majority in an attacking context. but it is too late. Also after 24-.. c6 25 e3 £)e7 26 a41, followed by.a3 and Wf3, White exerts strong pressure. 25 £>e3 £lb6 26 g41 fxg4 The alternative try 26...Sf8 seems more tenacious, although after the reply 27 Wf3 'i'hS 28 Sg2 Black's task remains very difficult. 27 £>xg4 Ef8 28 £}f6+ £h8 Here or later, an exchange sacrifice on f6 has the drawback of letting the white rooks enter along the e-file. 29 <g2! Tying Black's pieces to the defence of the d5-pawn. After 29 f5 gxf5 30 Wxf5 Wf7 he would have more chances of survival - Gligoric. 29...£)c6 Benko prepares...£)e7-f5, exploiting the fact that 30 £)xd5? fails to 3O...£ixd4. 30Wh31 d8 Black can't complete his plan, since 30...Wf7 runs into 31 £>xh71 - Gligoric. 31.cl! Example 140 S.GIigoric-P.Benko Budapest 1948 In a Nimzo-lndian battle Black has delayed his natural plan of...b6-b5,...a7-a5,...b5-b4 etc, while White has made all the preparatory moves needed for an expansion on the otherflank. 21e4l The pawn majority starts moving. Now 21...dxe4 22 fxe4 would just give Benko additional worries along the f-file, so he prefers to keep the position closed. 21...Wb? 22 e5 £)d7 23 f 41 With the strong threat of 24 f5- Black has only one reply. 23...f5 24£tfl! Clearing the way for the g-pawn. As we will see, Black won't be able to maintain the kingside blockade. Had this been the case, then 24 exf6 followed by f4-f5 would have been worth considering. 24...b5 Initiating counterplay on the queenside. The last piece joins the attack with decisive effect. 31...4 c8 32 &hl Sa6 33 f5l gxf5 34 £h6 Black lost on time, but after the continuation 34..2f7 35 Bgl e7 36 Beg2 the game is over anyway. ample, 16...dxe4 17 £>xe4.&.g7 18 f 51 with an initiative. 16e5!

White is slightly better. 19 £f5 Another good option was 19 S.e41? with a direct attack on the d5-pawn. 19...Hc7 20 63 d4?l Black saves the pawn but also surrenders the e4-square. Preferable was 2O...Wa8 21 £>d4 Wa7 22 £)ce2 b4, followed by...Wb6 and...a5, with just a slight disadvantage. 21 £e41 A key move, neutralizing the bishop on b7 and clearing the way for the f-pawn. 21...£je6 22 £xb7 lxb7 Example 141 J.Hellsten-G.Soppe Pinamar 2004 Another opening line that frequently produces a kingside pawn majority is the Exchange Variation of the Queen's Gambit. In the position above. White already initiated the plan of f2-f3 and e3-e4 in order to advance his majority. Black, on the other hand, intends a counter-strike with...c6-c5, prepared by...S.c8. 14 £xf6I A simple, but strong solution. White gives up the bishop pair in order to enable the advance of his kingside pawns. The immediate 14 e4 was less convincing due to 14.. dxe4 15 fxe4 £ig41, when both 16 £xe7 Wxe7 17 Wcl c5l and 16 JLci c51 yield Black counterplay on the dark squares. 14—&xf6 15 e4 Hc8 After 15-.dxe4 16. fxe4 £.xd4 17 xd4 Wxd4 18 Ji.xbS, followed by.a4-b3, White is a bit better thanks to his healthier pawn structure - Soppe. But the prophylactic 15...g61? was interesting. Then White should avoid 16 e5?l -&.g7 17 f4 f 5? with a successful blockade of the majority. 16 f 41, preparing f4-f5, seems preferable; for ex- 23 f5!

White avoids the trick 24 h4? £>e41 25 £>xe4 Wxh4+ and creates an advanced passed pawn that will make the black king feel uneasy. Pawn Play 24—fxe6 25£>f4 The knight exploits the active f4-square that was just vacated by the f-pawn. 25—&h8 In the event of 25...Wb8 unpinning the d4-pawn. White has 26 £>xe6 £>xe6 27 £>e4!

In the event of 27...Sbe7 28£)e4 £b6 29 £)g5 White enjoys excellent attacking prospects. 28 Wd5lSbb8 29 e4 A natural move in order to activate the knight. The straightforward 29 Wxc5 dxc3 30 bxc3 e7 31 Sd6! was also strong. 29-Sbd8 will leave the back rank vulnerable. The last chance was 33...Wg4 34 h3 Wg6, touching the e6-pawn, although after 35 Ecl! followed by Ec6, White is winning in the long run. 34 Exf8+ _&.xf8 35 g3 We7 Or 35->g4 36 e7 dl+ 37 &g2, when both 37-.We2+ 38 2)f2! and 37-£xe7 38 Wxe7 We2+ 39 h3 h5+ 40 Wh4 lead to a win.

A last slip in time trouble, but 37-Wc4 38 &g2 WC6 39 &h3 was equally desperate for Black. 38 e7l £xe7 39 xe7 Wf2 40 Wb8+ Black resigned. The next example shows the advance of a kingside pawn majority as a way of gaining space and central control. Example 142 P.San Segundo-V.Kramnik Madrid 1993 30 e5! White again exploits the squares that have been vacated by his pawn advances, thus securing a central position for his queen. Now that 30.._&.a7? 31 £)d6 would be disastrous for Black, he has to give up the d4-pawn. 30—&e7 31 2xd4 Exd4 32 Wxd4 h6 33 We5! The queen returns to its preferred square. 33...2f8? A bad idea, since the absence of rooks 29-..i.d6?l 30 d2, when the knight reaches the strong c4-square since 3O...i.xd5?? loses a piece after 31 fl. In contrast, after the text 30 £jd2? i.xd5 doesn't work for White, so the knight is forced to a less active square. 30 &h4 Sad8 31 d6 The pawn sacrifice 31 b41? cxb4 32 d6 is well met by 32... f8 preparing...Ee6, e.g. 33 i.b3 e3 34 f xe3 Sxe3 with a sound extra pawn. 31.-i.f8 32 g4 32 d7 Se7 33 g41 was a lesser evil; for example, 33-Sexd7 34 gxf5 i.e7 35 Sxd7 Sxd7 36 £jg2 gxf5 37 £>e3 with more counterplay than in the game. Black is better, thanks to his bishop pair and more mobile pawn majority. However, a stereotypical move like 22...Sad8?! permits 23.e4l neutralizing the bishop pair. Kramnik finds a much better option. 22...f51 A power move that restricts the white bishop and enables a future kingside expansion by...g7-g6 and...e6-e5. 23 Sei White prepares Q>eS and vacates di for the other rook. 23.-i.f4l Forcing the white queen to a less active square before taking further action.

Pawn chains A common feature in some closed and semi-closed openings, such as the French and the King's Indian, is the arrangement of both sides' pawns in chains. Let's see some examples on this topic. Example 143 R.Vaganian-A.PIaninec Moscow 1975 When attacking a pawn chain it often makes sense to undermine its rear points, as in this simple example. 17 b5! Vaganian starts a queenside attack with a focus on the c6-pawn, which sustains the rest of the black pawn chain. 17...We6 In contrast, Black is not even close to achieving a similar attack by...f5-f4 at the £>xc5 just helps Black in improving his knight. 19...6b8 20 a3 Wb6!

Example 144 J.Timman-G.Kamsky Tilburg 1990 In this typical position from the Caro- Kann White enjoys more space but Black has no tangible weaknesses.

Example 145 J.Nunn-K.Bischoff Hamburg 1984 18 2)el! This retreat doesn't just enable a recapture with the knight on d3, it also prepares f4-f5 with an attack on the black pawn chain. 18...£c8 19Sxc8 bxc8 20 f4 The strength of the f4-f5 plan is further emphasized by the location of the black king on f8. In the following, Bischoff tries to solve this problem by a king march to the other flank. 20...Wd7! 21 g4 21 fS'.? exf5 22 g4 was a more straightforward option, when 22...fxg4? fails to 23 e6. 21...6.8 22 f5 2)b6?l Preferable was 22...*±'d8, carrying on with the plan; e.g. 23 fxe6 fxe6 24 fif7 Hg8 or 23 £>g2 &c7 24 £)f4 Hf8 with just a slight disadvantage - Nunn. 23 g2.xd3?

The attack at the base of the opponent's pawn chain isn't necessarily associated to the creation of a weak pawn. Often the goal is less specific: to open a new front, create activity, etc, just like Nunn's f4-f5 in the previous example. The following example is a similar case. Pawn Play 18 xa4 After 18 Wc2 £ixc3 19 Wxc3, both 19...f4 20.fi.f2 g5 and 19...2>h51? 20 fifei £)f4 21.fi.fl g5 lead to black counterplay - Huzman. 18,..Hxa4 19 c5 -fi-bs! Black avoids the trick 20 c6 and again exploits the space vacated by the opponent's pawn moves in order to improve his pieces. Actually Bischoff applied a similar idea by....fi.e7-g5 in the previous game. and...Wg6 as a possible follow-up. 14...£tf6 When attacking pawn chains there often appears a choice whether to capture at the opponent's base or advance the attacking pawn one step further. In this particular case, the first option with 14...fxe4?l makes little sense after 15 £idxe4, when the e4square turns into a strong base for the white pieces. On the other hand, 14. f4 15 Ji.f2 g5, preparing an attack on the "new" base on f3, deserves attention, and this is indeed a typical plan in the King's Indian. There can follow 16 a3 £tf6 17 b4 axb4 18 axb4 when both 18...b6 19 £ib51, intending Hal with an indirect attack on c7, and 18...h5 19 C5 g4 20 cxd6 cxd6 21 £ic4, with double threats at d6 and b6, seem to favour White. In conclusion, neither I4...fxe4 nor 14...f4 is fully satisfactory at this moment, so Polgar's flexible 14...£tf6 is more reasonable, saving either of these options for a more suitable occasion. 15 33 &C5 Improving the knight before it is restricted by b3-b4. 16 b4 axb4 17 axb4 ®a4 20 Bel?! This lets Black take the initiative by his next strong move. 20.fi.c41 was preferable, when both 2O...Ha3 21 We2 and 2O....fi.xc4 21 £)xc4 fxe4 22 cxd6! favour White. Thus Black should in turn prefer 2O...fxe4 21 fxe4.fi.xc4 22 xc4 xe4, when 23 d3 4 f6 24 cxd6 cxd6 25 £lxd6 Wd7 26 £)e4 leads to a slight advantage - Huzman. Interestingly, in this variation both pawn chains were reduced to one single isolated pawn. 20..JIa3! 21 Jfixb5 Wxb5 22 We2 Renewing the idea of 23 £ic4, which forces Black to swap queens. 22...Wxe2 23 Sxe2 fxe41 Finally Polgar goes for the first option outlined in the comment to the 14th move, in order to intensify her kingside initiative. This is a good moment for the capture on White is now considerably closer to the desired c4-c5 advance, at the cost of some black counterplay along the a-file. 29...£h6 30 h3 2>e3 31 Efel?!

The more sober 36 Bbl can be answered in the same way. 25— Sa4l A precise move that emphasizes White's main problems in this part of the game: his queenside pawns have become vulnerable, and the original plan of attacking the base on d6 is no longer realistic. We saw a few similar cases of a space advantage turning into a liability in Stolz-Hellsten and Miles- Byrne (the 29-Ed8 subline). 26 cxd6 cxd6 27 £b6 27 £ic4 Bxb4 28 £>xd6? fails tactically to 28...£jxe3 29 Exe3 Ed8, while after 27 b5 Ec8 Black enjoys a strong initiative. 27-flc8!

Here is one more example on this topic. The immediate 9 -.d4 is well met by 10 £)h41, preparing f2-f4, in the same spirit of Polgar's...f7-f5 in the previous example. There can follow lO-. cT 11 £1C4.f8 12 f4 C5 13 a41 (reinforcing the knight on c4) 13..exf4 14 gxf4 £>b6 15 h 3 (preventing £>g4-e3) 15-. xc4 16 bxc4 g6 17 -&.C1 iLg7 18 Wf3 We7 19 f2 £d7 20 £d2 £f8 21 Eael.d7 22 f 51 with an initiative in K.Rathnakaran-Pr.Roy, New Delhi 2009. 10 Eel d4 Example 147 A.Kunte-L.Ravi Indian Championship, Mumbai 2000 Caro-Kann Defence (BIO) 1 e4 c6 2d3 White avoids 2 d4 with a mainstream Caro-Kann, and instead sets up a King's Indian Attack. 2...d5 3 £)d2 e5 4 £gf3 £>d7 5 g3 2>gf6 6 £.g2 £d6 7 O-O O-O Black finally resorts to this advance, which gains some space and restricts the bishop on b2. In contrast, 10...dxe4 11 dxe4, followed by 4k4 or £)fi-e3-f5, should yield White a slight advantage, while the flexible 10...£)f8 permits 11 exd5 cxd5 12 c41 with some initiative, e.g. 12...d4 13 c5! followed by 14 Ecl and £k4. 11C3I With the rook on el and the black queen on c7 the plan with f2-f4 becomes less feasible, so White prefers to attack the black pawn chain at its front. 11...dxc3 After 11...c5 12 Ecl Black probably has to capture on c3 anyway, with a transposition to the game. 12 -&XC3 C5 As a result of the C2-C3 advance Black 8 b3 8 Sei Ee8 9 c3 is a more frequent continuation. In the game White hurries to deploy his bishop on the long diagonal in order to put pressure on the eS-pawn. If Black later tries to restrict this bishop by...d5-d4 and...c6-c5, then he will have lost a few tempi compared to a normal King's Indian with reversed colours. 8...Ee8 9 Jlb2 Bc7 gained a protected square on d4, but with the knight on d7 it is not easy for him to exploit it On the other hand, the clearance of the c-file and the al-h8 diagonal will soon prove useful to White. 13 Scl«d8 An understandable retreat in order to avoid d3-d4 or b3-b4, but 13„.b5, taking the c4-square from the knight, was probably a better choice. 14 £>C4 &C7 15 a4 a5?! This merely helps secure the white knight on c4, where it will tie its colleague on d7 to the defence of the e5-pawn for the rest of the game. I5...b6 was a lesser evil, with a remote hope of...a7-a6 and...b6-b5- 16Wd2l Heading for b2 to step up the pressure. 16...Ha6 17 Wb2 We7 18 &e3 Ec6 19 £)f5 d8 20&d2! The other knight "inherits" C4 and clears the way for a future f2-f4 advance. 20...g6 The further course of the game suggests that Black does better without this natural move, perhaps by 2O... f8 21 £>c4 £>g6. 21 £>e3 £>f8 22 < dc4 £)6d7 23 £>dS b6 24...T6 If 24...exf4 25 gxf4 £>e6, trying to relieve the tension by...£}d4, then 26.f6! and White wins material. 25 Hfl &b8 26 Bf 2 &b7 27 Scfl exf4 A positional surrender, but the pressure on Black's position was unbearable.

Wc8 32 £f3 More pieces join the attack. 32...£>d4 33 fig2+ &f8 34 -&xd4 cxd4 35 xd4 In this desperate position, Black resigned. Example 148 J.Hellsten-I.Nikoloitsos Athens 2002 The following position shows a different kind of pawn chain, with double fronts (cS and e5) on Black's side, and double bases (c4 and e4) on White's side, so to speak. In such a structure, both players are typically aiming at a pawn breakthrough on the bfile or the f-file. 24 f41 Softening up the al-h8 diagonal towards the black king. Pawn Play 21 flef2 4}e8, followed by...£id6, the latter has no major problems. 20...£c8 21 £h4 Another good option was 21.g3 £>d7 22 £)b5! a6 23 £>a7 £b7 24 $.a4! followed by £>c6. 21...a6 At this point Black isn't really preparing...b6-b5 anymore, but simply aims to avoid £)c3-b5 whenever the queen moves out of the pin on the h4-d8 diagonal. 22 a4 Neither is White trying to stop...b6-b5, but rather intends a4-a$ to soften up the c5-pawn. 22...Wd6 23 Wf2!

Before taking concrete action it makes sense to rule out...£tf6-g4 or..JLc8-g4, since any piece exchange would make Black's position a little less cramped. 15...We7 16 fidel White slowly prepares the key advance f2-f4, which would be premature at this point due to the pressure on e4. 16...Ad7?l This leaves the knight on f6 without its preferred retreat square. 16...a6 was preferable, when White can consider both the restrictive 17 a4 and the more ambitious 17 a3!?, preparing b2-b4. 17 £dl!

Dynamics In the first chapter I defined dynamic play as the one that creates new elements in the

[diagram]

by pawn moves and occasionally by exchanges. According to that definition, this whole chapter is in fact filled with dynamic operations, as well as the section on "dynamic exchanges" in the previous chapter, and many other parts of the book. Thus it is rather difficult to separate dynamics from other strategical concepts, since it is constantly present in the battle. Anyway, in the following section we will have a look at some dynamic operations of a more radical nature, with a great impact on the strategical balance of the position. Example 150 J.Garcia Padron-M.Suba Las Palmas 1979 achieves any of these advances, the position tends to change drastically, with a notable increase of activity among his forces. 21&de2? This knight retreat generates an attack on the d6-pawn; however, it also lets Black launch one of the pawn advances mentioned above. Perhaps White should have looked for a better destiny for his queen, a piece that often becomes exposed in the Hedgehog. 21 We2?l runs into the other key advance 21...d$! with the rook x-raying the queen along the e-f ile, but 21 Bel, followed by ficdl and Wcl-al, or even fie2 and Wei, was a more cautious option. 21...b51 Romanian GM Mihai 5uba is one of the pioneers in the Hedgehog, and he probably didn't think for a long time about this move. 22 cxb5 After 22 Wxd6 bxc4 White ends up with a weak pawn on b3. 22...axb5 23 f3 Securing the e4-pawn.

White no longer enjoys a space advantage, and most of his pawns can be considered as weaknesses. Meanwhile, Black's pieces remain harmoniously placed. The Hedgehog structure is a good starting point when discussing the role of dynamics. Despite an evident space disadvantage, Black's position has a lot of dynamic potential, based mainly on the pawn advances...d6-d5 and...b6-b5.

Instead, 21...h6 runs into 22 g41 e4 (or 22...fxg4? 23 Wg6+) 23 £g3 £)xg3 24 hxg3 when Black is incapable of covering all his weak points, but 21...£te4 22 fxgS.fi.xg5 23 £rf4 e7 was probably a lesser evil. Example 158 J.Hellsten-R.Bator Malmo 1997 In a King's Indian battle Black has just played...fld8-d7 in order to double rooks on the d-file. To aspire for any advantage White somehow needs to alter the balance of the position. tage, e.g. 22...Wb5 23 £>b21 followed by £ixc4- The simple 21 £ja41? is interesting as well. 20 Ab 6 Preparing £}a4-c5- Again the captures on d4 were inadequate due to the tactical resource...£}g4, while 20 a4? at once fails to 2O...Hxe4. 20...Wd6 The alternative was 20...Wb8, keeping the queen away from the vulnerable d-file.

Now the threat of 22 Axd4 exd4 23 Axc4 forces Black to swap his active rook. 21...1.dl 22ExdlWxb4 18 a41 A strong advance that creates new opportunities on the queenside. At the time of this game, I had recently seen the encounter M.Krasenkow-J.Hickl, Jakarta 1996, in which a similar idea was effected. 18...bxc4 After 18...bxa4?l 19 £>xa4 the knight obtains interesting destinies at b6 and c5, while 18.-A.xc4 19 Axc4 bxc4 20 We 2 also lets White progress on the queenside; e.g. 20...a5?l 21 bxaS Wxa5 22 Wxc4 and the outside passed pawn is a long-term asset. 19 a5!

I should admit that, during the game, the dynamic sacrifice 23...£>d51? worried me a little. However, White has no reason to alter the balance by 24 exd5?! cxd$, and should rather continue 24 Hbl!, when both 24->c3 25 Wa4 and 24->a3 25 £>xe6 fxe6 26 £.xc4 keep Black troubled by his weak pawns. 24 Hbl Wa3 25 &xe6 fxe6 26 Sb3 Wa4 27 Hxc3l Simplest, in order to speed up the attack on the a6-pawn.

Restriction In the previous chapters we often came across the idea of restriction. For example, in Miles-5unye Neto (p. 86) the former successfully limited the opponent's lightsquared bishop, while in Karpov-Lautier (p. 105) White constantly prevented the...c6-c5 advance. Generally speaking, the restrictive measures are directed either at the opponent's plans, or at the range of some of his pieces. Although these could sometimes be regarded as synonymous, the former case is more specific and the latter more general. Let's start with some examples closely related to the restriction of enemy plans. Example 159 J.H.Donner-W.Balcerowski Varna Olympiad 1962 In a kind of Old Benoni Black has just The previous three chapters showed numerous examples on how to improve our pieces, realize favourable exchanges, and use our pawns for all kinds of benefits. In contrast, the focus of the present chapter is on the opponent's play, more specifically the measures that we can take to prevent or confront his plans. I have used "Prophylaxis'' as the name of this chapter, since it is a familiar term in chess literature when referring to the above matters. Even so, this term can have more than one interpretation, which is why I have opted for a further split in several concepts. Before going more into details, here is a brief definition of each concept, as they are interpreted in this book: Restriction Prevent the opponent's plans and movements, i.e. not let him do what he wants. Prophylaxis Prepare for the opponent's plans, i.e. let him do what he wants but with less impact than expected. Prophylaxis played...£ie7-g6, vacating the e7-square for the bishop in order to develop his pieces. How would you now continue with White? The equally developing 9.d3 $Le7 10 O-O permits 10....&g5! and Black manages to swap his "bad" bishop for the opponent's good one with a decent game. 11...b6 12 dl! Heading for the nice square at fs. 12... d7 13 &e3 If 13..J.f6, preparing...£}e7, then White could consider 14 &h3 e7 15 £.xd7! 1fi, xd7 16 £>g4, winning a pawn. 14 h5 h8 15 15...fia7? The last chance was 15...h6 with a horrible position, in particular for the knight on h8 which can't return to the game without a further weakening of the kingside. 16 h6! In view of 16...g6 17 £ixe7+ Wxe7 18.g5, Black resigned. Admittedly Balcerowski could have defended better, yet the effect of White's 9th and 10th moves on the battle were surprisingly strong. Example 160 N.Short-G.Kasparov Amsterdam 1996 9g3l Donner is attentive to the opponent's plan and takes restrictive measures. 9...&e7 10 h4! Now Black's minor pieces don't have any prospects whatsoever. 10...O-O ii jLd2 Other good options were 11,&h3 and 11 2>dl. White has a more pleasant position. His isolated pawn on e5 is restricts the movements of the enemy pieces, and the semi open f-file will be useful in an attack. Before taking concrete action, Short considers the opponent's intentions. Kasparov reinstalls the threat of...J.xb4, but the time spent on the,._fi.g5-e7 manoeuvre could have cost him dearly. 26...h4 was a safer choice, when 27 e2l? followed by f2 keeps a clear advantage. 27 gxh5l With all the pieces directed at the black king, this is the right moment to strike. Instead, the game saw 27 Ebl? h4 28 We3 £)e81, preparing...£ic7-d5, and Black improved his position to some extent. 27... xh5 28 Sxf7! Exf7 29 Sxf7 &xf7 30 Wxg6+ *f 8 31 h6+ 2)g7 32 J.g6 White mates in a few moves - Short. Example 161 P.Konguvel-T.Markowski Koszalin 1998 19 b4l Preventing 19._J1.c5 with a bishop exchange that would favour Black, on account of his space disadvantage and the potential white attack. 19-.. g7 20 g4! Taking the f5-square from the knight. 20...h5 21 h3! a5 22 a3> Ed7 White's restriction policy has finally left the opponent without active moves, and the idea of a king's attack can be resumed. 23 Bf3 Wd8 24 Bbl The immediate 24 Safi?! permits 24...axb4 25 axb4 JLxb41. After the text Black has ended up in some kind of zugzwang. 24—£g5 25 Ebfl axb4 26 axb4 £e7?' The previous example showed the usage of restriction in the attack, whereas here we will see it in a more defensive context. The location of the kings on opposite flanks suggests that both sides are eager to attack. However, the straightforward il...bs is well met by 12 £ig3 g6 13 h41, preparing h4-h5 and Wh2, when 13....xh4? obviously fails to 14 Wh2. Markowski finds a more appealing solution.

The dynamic 13..b51? 14 cxb5 c7 was also interesting. 14 Ad3 We715£h6?l f6! Now the positional threat of 16....&g5 forces the white bishop to return. 16 £.e3 flf7 17 Wg2 £)f8 18 2>ge2 £d7 19 f4 This yields Black new opportunities on the e-file, but there was no other real way of making progress; e.g. 19 Wh3 g51? 20 £}g3 £}g6, heading for f4. 19...exf4 20 ®xf4 Kb8 21 We2 bs! anchettoed bishop, or Bel and ±fl preparing e4-e5. However, before going any further with the own plans, it makes sense to ask the usual question: what does my opponent want to do? 12 b3l Smyslov has observed that Black is planning....xc4, followed by...a7-a6 and...b6b5 with queenside counterplay. By 12 b3 he prepares to meet 12....xc4 by 13 bxc41, after which the...b6-b5 advance is no longer feasible. In contrast, 12 e5?l £>h5 yields Black counterplay. 12...&d7 12,..£ih5 is met by the simple 13 -fi.d2, while after 12...Ze8 13 Wd2.xc4 14 bxc41 e6 15 Af3»? exd5 16 exdS a6 17 Sabi Wd7 18 Wd3, White keeps the...b6-b5 advance at bay with some advantage. 13 *'d2 f5 Now that queenside counterplay is no longer available, Schmid logically looks for activity on the other flank. 14 Hadi fxe4 15 £jxe4 Zf 5 After 15....b7 16 £.g5 We8 17 Zdel!? the complications apparently favour White; e.g. 17...®xd5? 18 £.g4 or 17...-&xd5?l 18 £jexd6! exd6 19 itf3, while 17...Wf7? runs into 18 £>cxd6! exd6 19 £)xd6 WxdS 20.c4.

For example, here the direct 18....c5?l 19 £>dfS backfires after 20 Wg41. Keres opts for a more simple solution. 18...g6! Taking the f5-square from the white knights and restricting the bishop on c2. 19 £h6?l The bishop is actively developed, but the rest of White's pieces remain in bad positions. The sacrifice 19 &df 5?! gxf5 20 £M5 can be met by 2O....f8, preparing...f7-f6; e.g. 21 Wg4+ h8 22 Wd4+ f6 and Black defends.

Prophylaxis Perhaps only at this point Winter realized what was going on. 20 hxg5 hxg5 21 b3 c6! No hurry. Black should be able to recapture with a pawn on b5 in order to keep controlling the light squares, such as a4. In contrast, after 21...b5?l 22 axbs Sxbs 23 Ha4 Hb4 24 Hhal it will be much more difficult to progress on the queenside. 22 Ha2 bs 23 Hhal Example 164 W.Winter-J.R.Capablanca Hastings 1919 Here is a classical case regarding the restriction of a specific piece. 12...£g4l Capablanca prepares...&xf3 in order to double the white f-pawns, after which the bishop on g3 will be locked out for the rest of the game. Sadly for White, he can't stop this plan. 13 h3 £xf3 14 Wxf3 Wxf3 15 gxf3 f6 16 £g2?! Probably 16 Jtfdl, followed by fl-e2d2, offered more resistance as the king does nothing on g2. Then White would have to sacrifice a pawn by f3-f4 followed by f2-f3 in order to get his bishop back into the game. Although this should be equally hopeless in the long run, at least it yields more counterplay than in the game. 16...as! Black starts action on the queenside, where he is practically a piece up. The fact that his pawns are temporarily placed on squares of the same colour as his bishop is of little relevance. 17 a4 &f7 18 Ehl &e6 19 h4 Sfb8< 23...C41 A decisive breakthrough that splits the white pawns and activates the black pieces. 24 axb5 Or 24 dxc4 bxc4 25 bxc4 Hb4 followed by...Hab8 and...Hxc4. 24...cxb3 25 cxb3 Sxb5 Now it becomes evident that with such a passive bishop White won't be able to resist on the queenside. 26 fia4 Sxb3 27 d4 Sb5 28 Sc4 Hb4 29 Exc6 Sxd4 0-1 Example 165 V.Malakhov-M.Narciso Dublan Spanish Team Championship 2004 The reduced number of pieces and the Parrying the threat of 21 Jla3+ eS 22 £}C4, heading for d6. symmetrical pawn structure might suggest a quick draw, but as we will see next, this is not what Malakhov has in mind. 21a4l Malakhov clears the fl-a6 diagonal for his bishop towards the future target on a6, and also liberates the c4-square for his knight. 21..Jkxe5?

Let's see some more examples of this idea. Example 167 M.Tal-A.Koblencs Riga 1954 Black has just played...Wd8-e7, unpinning the bishop on d7. Tai easily predicts the opponent's intention,...Ad7-c6, and takes prophylactic measures.

Parrying the threat of 22...£ig4.

A piece with a natural need for prophylaxis is the king. In fact we just saw a few cases where weak points in the king's position were covered by his fellow pieces. However, the prophylaxis can also be performed by the king himself; e.g. by &gl-hl or...&g8-h8 as seen in Hellsten-Olesen, Guliev-Timman and Avrukh-Grigoriants. As for positions with long castling, a prophylactic ci-bl or... cS-bS is even more frequent, and we saw one example in Timman-Kamsky, where both sides in fact carried out this idea. Here are a few other methods of royal prophylaxis. Example 174 LB.Hansen-S.Tiviakov Istanbul Olympiad 2000 Most of White's pieces are directed at the enemy kingside, and next he might be planning 21 Wd3 with the worrying threat of 22 d5 exd5 23 &xf6 Wxf6 24 h7+ h8 25 h8 mate. How should Black react to this? A typical counter-strike against the hanging pawns, and one that we already saw in Aagaard-Akesson (p. 201). Since 25 cxb5?l.xb5 or 25 c5?l 2ad8 produces a weak pawn on d4 and a strong base for the black pieces on d5. White goes fora pawn sacrifice. 25„-bxc4 26 £xf6 gxf6 After 26...'Sfxf6?! 27.&xc4 Black would just have an additional worry about £>g3h5. 27 £xc4.xd5 28 lxd5 Wxd5 Safer than 28...S.ad8 29 £>e4 Sxd5 30 Wc3 - Wells. 29 xd5exd5 Black's extra pawn yields him a slight advantage in the endgame. 20...&f8!

As beginners we were told to secure our king from back rank mates by advancing a pawn in front. This idea remains frequent in practice at all levels. In the above position Black has a definite initiative thanks to the opponent's stranded king in the centre. Before taking concrete action, Polgar applies some simple prophylaxis. 21...h6! Creating a flight square on h7, something that will prove useful in any tactical context. In contrast, the active 21...Hc2?l 22 b3 Ha2 runs into 23 We51, covering al and threatening mate, with counterplay. 22 £ld4?l This won't end well, but it is was not easy for White to free himself. For example, if 22 b3, intending &d2 and Hcl, then simply 22....xb3! 23 Wxb3 Hcl+ 24 &d2 Hxhl and Black wins the exchange, now that 25 Wb8+ can be parried by 25...&h7. 22...Wg2 23Sfl.&.d7! Perhaps Akopian overlooked this strong transfer of the bishop to h3. 24£>f3 Example 1 76 Kir.Georgiev-R.Dautov Istanbul Olympiad 2000 In view of the weakness on d5, White has a slight but enduring edge. However, the pawn is immune for the moment, i.e. 26 Axd5?? Axd5 27 Hxd5 Wxd5'. 28 Wxd5 flal+. Moreover, Black has a dangerous plan in...Wc3 followed by...Hal. Prophylaxis implies some chances for a draw. 33 &d71 b4 34 Zb7 26 g3! A simple prophylactic measure. Ceorgiev moves his king from the vulnerable back rank to a safer place on g2. This is indeed a very common method in practice, one that we already saw in Anand-Adams (p. 62) and Spassky-Taimanov (p. 143), the latter actually in a much less tactical context. 26...Wc3 27 &g2 Ha2 A tempting move which lets Black swap the d5-pawn for the one on e3, but even so White retains an edge. The alternative was 27...Hal, when 28 Wd2 Wxb3 29 Eb4' ®a2 30 Wxa2 Exa2 31 Cxb6 Ha7 32 EbS followed by JtxdS yields White some practical chances in a theoretically drawn endgame. 28 AxdS Wxe3 29 Wf 3l Axd5 Here and on the next move, after 29...Wxf3+ 30 &xf3 £xdS+ 31 Exd5 &f8 32 Ed6! White again obtains practical winning chances; e.g. 32...Ea6 33 b4 followed by 34 b5 or 32..JJb2 33 flxb6 - Dautov. 30 Exd5 We8 Now it is Black who has a back rank problem, e.g. 3O...We7 31 We3!. 31Sd6 b5 32>c6 Wf8? Black should have taken his last chance to enter a rook endgame by 32...Wxc6+! 33 Exc6 &f8 - Dautov.

Now he achieves a decisive double threat. 38 Wc7l Exf2+ 39 £xf2 Wa2+ 40 &f3 Wxb3+ Black resigned, not waiting for 41 f4. Nimzowitsch introduced the concept of mysterious rook moves, by which a rook is placed on a potentially open file. This idea is rather standard in today's practice, and we already saw a related case in Lugovoi- Orlov (p. 66). Here is one more example. Example 177 Zsu.Polgar-U.Bonsch Dortmund 1990 White has employed the Exchange Variation with £>ge2 against the Queen's Bxe4 31 Ef8+ h7 32 £d3 or 29-..Exe4 30 Wf8+! with similar consequences. Cambit. Now she is planning e3-e4 with a strong pawn centre, an idea familiar to us from Hellsten-Soppe (p. 176). Black, on the other hand, would like to create counterplay by a timely...c6-c5- Another simple but useful prophylactic measure is the retreat of a piece just before it is threatened. We already came across this idea in a few earlier examples, such as Cabrilo-Ziatdinov with 32...fla8 (p. 49) and Beliavsky-Yusupov with 24... e7 (p. 151). The main point of this idea is to gain more flexibility on our next move, as in the following example. 14 Hadi! Giving some extra support to the d4pawn and discouraging Black from...c6-c5. 14... g6 Indeed, after 14...C5?! 15.xf6 JLxf6 16 dxc5 Exe3 17 xd5l White wins a pawn, thanks to the presence of the rook on dl. 15 Af2 £d6 On this occasion 15...C5? runs into 16.fi.xg6 hxg6 17 dxc5.xc5 18 xd5l, again winning a pawn - Polgar. 16 e4! dxe4 17 fxe4 &g4 18 e5! &c7 After 18... xf2? 19 Wxf2 f7-pawn falls. 19 &c4!

Example 179 J.Timman-A.Karpov London 1984 In this typical Benoni structure Black has just played...a7-a6 with the apparent intention of...b6-b5. 19 Af 1! Retreating the bishop in advance. Now if Black goes...b6-b5 anyway, then after a double capture on bs White obtains the possibility of Sal-a7, a move that he obviously didn't have at his disposal in the first place. 19...Sec8 Indeed, after 19...b5? 20 axb5 axb5 21 fla7! Black is in trouble; e.g. 2i...b4 22 £>b5 Bec8 23 e51, intending 23-dxeS? 24 d6, or 21...C4 22 e51 h7 23 f 4 with a clear advantage - Vera. 20 g3 White is in no hurry and makes a useful move on the other flank which enables.fl-h3 at some moment. 20...b5 The only chance for activity. 21 axb5 axb5 22 Ea7l b4 23 2)a4 Due to Black's sensible 19th move, 23 4bbS? no longer worked: 23..JZxb5 24 Axb5 Wxb5. 23...Wd8 24e5l A strong advance that clears the position for the bishop pair and softens up the c5-pawn. The same method of retreating a piece before it is threatened can be particularly powerful when applied to the king in a tactical context. Here White is trying to make his attack work by means of £)a5+ and a sacrifice on c6. 19...&a8! An excellent prophylactic measure.

Example 180 N.Grandelius-I.Sokolov Malmo 2009 For the related exercises, see page 347. Provocation A common idea within modern practice is to force the opponent to make undesirable moves. In the present book, this goes under the term provocation. From a strategical perspective, the cases with pawn moves are the most interesting to study, due to the greater long-term impact on the position. For example, the provocative measures can cause weak squares and weak pawns in the Prophylaxis Or 22.&b4 £ig4 23 iLel f5 with counterplay - Karpov. 22...6d7 The knight glances at c5 and also overprotects the e5-pawn, thus enabling a future...d6-d5 with a fight for the c-file. 23 2>d2 2>ec51 Leaving the enemy knight awkwardly placed on d2. 24 axb6 axb6 25 f3 e4l 26 fxe4 After 26 f4?l d3 27 Wd4 4 7c5 Black is clearly better - Karpov. We saw a similar case with "neighbouring" protected squares in Sasikiran-lljushin (p. 23). 26..6xe4 27 £>xe4 £.xe4 Avoiding the doubtful 27...Wxe4?l 28 jLf 3 Wxe3+ 29 JLf2 with some counterplay for the pawn. 28 £g3 Wg6 opponent's camp, and also restrict his pieces. In the earlier section about creating weaknesses we saw several examples where the pawns themselves performed this task, for example by majority and minority attacks. In contrast, the following examples focus on provocation realized by the pieces. Example 181 G.Hertneck-A.Karpov German League 1994 White has just played 18 a4 preparing a4-a5 with a majority attack. Karpov finds the perfect antidote. 18...Aa6! By attacking the c4-pawn, Black provokes b4-b5 which will convert the c5square into a base for his pieces. 19 b5 After 19 Wa2?l Hfc8 the c4-pawn just gets in trouble, so Hertneck accepts the provocation. 19...£b7 20 aS h6 Black delays occupying the c5-square, so as not to obstruct his rooks, and resorts to some useful prophylaxis. 21 Edl Sfc8 22 h3 Thanks to his light square grip Black has the better chances. The game saw 29 h2 d 5! 30 Had £tf6 31 £.fl Hc5 32 cxd5 2>xd5 3 3 Hxc5 Hxc5 and Karpov went on to win. Example 182 F.Vallejo Pons-S.Karjakin Dos Hermanas 2003 In this Hedgehog position Black has just can be appreciated: a protected square on d5. 16...Wd8 Or 16....xd5 17 cxd5, followed by Had, with strong pressure along the c-file. 17 h4l? An interesting advance. Vallejo has estimated that the kingside is where his ad vantage can be most easily increased. Now 17...h5?! 18 Jlg5! just leads to new prob lems for Black, so he prefers to continue development. 17...0.0 18 h5 £K5 19 h6! £h8 19...£>xd3? failed to 20 hxg7 xg7 21 JLxb6, but the alternative 19...JLf6 was probably a lesser evil - Ribli. 20b4l£)d7 Due to the inclusion of h5-h6 and..JLg7h8, Black can't reply 2O...£ixd3? 21 £xb6 £)f4 due to 22 £xd8 ®e2+ 23 &h2 £ixg3 24 £ie7 mate, while 2O....xd5 21 bxc5.b7 22 cxb6 is also bad for him. In conclusion, the natural 18...£ic5 seems to fail tactically. played...g7-g6 in order to conclude his development by...JLg7 and...O-O. 14£d4l An annoying reply. Now Black will either have to weaken his pawn structure by...e6e5, or suspend further development. Less convincing was 14 f 4?! Jtg7 15 f5 O-O with a balanced game. 14...e5 Opting for the former.

Again White uses this bishop for provocative means. Now the double threat at d8 and e7 forces Black to a further weakening of his pawn structure by...f7-f6, since the pin after 21... f6? 22 Wh4 would be fatal for him. 16 < d5 The first fruit of the provocative 14.d4 Prophylaxis 14...£}d6!

Less promising is 14...C5 15 dxc5 bxc5 16 b5.fi.b7 17 e3 with a slight white advantage - Almasi. 15 C5 15 b5? drops a pawn after 15...cxb5 16 axb5 £>xb5, while the passive 15 £)d2 can be met by 15. 6, followed by 16...£tfe4, renewing the fight for the c4-square. 15... e4 Just like in the previous two examples the "provocative" piece, after completing its mission, returns to its original square. 16 cxb6 Also after 16 e3 bxc5 17 bxc5 Wc7, preparing...e6-e5.

Provocative measures can also prove useful when attacking the enemy king. Here are two examples. The queen also has a great provocative potential. In the position above White hasn't really gained enough activity to compensate his isolated pawn, but that could change if he achieves Sd3-h3(g3) with an attack. 16...Wd51 Provoking f2-f3, a move White is hardly ever happy to play in the current structure. It doesn't just hamper a future kingside attack, it also weakens the dark squares surrounding his own king. 17f3b4 Now that there is no longer any need for defensive measures, Shirov initiates an attack himself on the queenside. 18 JLel as 19We3 Prophylaxis against..JLb7-a6. 19.. ac8 2O£g3?l Overly passive. 20 Ji.h4 must have been better.

Example 187 M.Tal-K.Darga USSR-West Germany match, Hamburg i960 White has the more active position, but his e5-pawn is exposed and the liberating...c6-c5 thrust must also be considered. How to proceed? The natural 15 £)d6 doesn't yield much after 15-...xd6 16 exd6 '8fb6+ 17 sthl c5l, when Black manages to finish off the bishop pair while safely blocking the passed pawn.

Weak squares The subject of weak squares is present in various parts of this book, especially in the section on improving the knight. Here we will continue the investigation, starting with two examples where the weak squares are exploited by other pieces. Example 189 V.Kramnik-V.Zvjaginsev Tilburg 1998 (seefollowing diagram) White is slightly better thanks to his more active pieces. A careful look also reveals that Black's queenside is somewhat exposed on the dark squares, a fact that Kramnik exploits at once. 25 £>dl! The knight is regrouped to e3 and, more importantly, the queen gains access to the protected square on b4- 25...g6?l Zvjaginsev avoids a future knight transfer to f5, but more to the point was 25..Wd6!, preventing 26 Wb4. White could react by 26 Uxe8 Zxe8 27 Exe8+ £xe8 28 £)e3 £d7 29 Wa5 with a pleasant advantage, but not as big as in the game. In contrast, 25...£)c4?l was inadvisable on account of 25.xc4 dxc4 26 d5 with a strong passed pawn. 26Wb4!£d7 Or 26...Hxe3 27 £>xe3 Wd8 28 £>g41, eyeing both h6 and e5- Miscellaneous 27 £b5l Swapping the opponent's bad bishop, but with a good reason: to win the a4pawn. 27...fixe 3 28 &xe3 4bf6 If 28...£ib6, holding on to the pawn, then after 29 £ig4 &g7 30.£xc6 bxc6 31 We7 or 31 WcS Black is under strong pressure. 28...Wa7? 29 £ixdS is even worse. 29 -&xa4 i.xa4 30 Wxa4 Ee8 Preparing...Se4 with some minimal compensation for the pawn. 31 'B'dl fie4 32 g41 White is obviously happy to exchange pieces. 32...£xg4 33 hxg4 Sf4 34 g3 Ef6 35 b3? More technical was 35 Se5 Ed6 36 We2 - Kramnik. 35... d8? Black, on his part, misses the stronger 35 - 81, intending 36 WxdS Wc2 with counterplay. 36 xb7 Eb6 Example 190 J.Hellsten-R.Sagit Swedish Championship, Gothenburg 2006 Despite a minimal material deficit Black has a comfortable game. His minor pieces are well placed and after a move like 34... te5 or even 34...g51?, gaining some space, it will not be easy for White to progress. However, my opponent fell for a more active continuation. 34...e5? Intending the advance...e5-e4 followed by...£)d7-e5, but the big flaw of this plan is that White gains a protected square for his pieces on ds, one that I will exploit to the maximum. 35£d5! e4 36£c4 A great diagonal for the bishop. Perhaps Sagit only at this point realized that 36... £kl7? drops a piece to 37 g4. 36...Wh3 37 Eds! Improving the rook and vacating dl for its colleague. 37....6.C3 The bishop is mobilized to the kingside defence. This time 37...£>d7 runs into 38 «dl! 2>f6 39 Hd8+ Kxd8 40 Wxd8+ *h7 41 37 2e8+! This tactic forces a decisive exchange combination. The game concluded 37...Wxe8 38 Wxb6 Wel+ 39 &g2 We4+ 40 t >h2 g7 41 Wc71 and Black resigned in view of 41...Wxd4 42 Wc31 or 41...We2 42 We5+. _&.xf7, when 41...£}g4? fails to 42 Wg8+. 38 Sbdl £.f6 39 Zd6! Example 191 Z.Milev-T.V.Petrosian Bucharest 1953 An annoying move for Black, whose bishop can't move due to the threat at g6. At the same time the d5-square is vacated for the other rook. 39...Zb7 In time trouble Sagit gives up a pawn in order to renew the idea of...£>d7-e5. Passive defence was equally unsuccessful; e.g. 39...W5 40 Ac6!, heading for c7, when 40....6e5 41 Hd5 leaves Black practically in zugzwang. It is rather striking that in just a few moves three white pieces have used the ds-square. 40 £ds Se7 41 Exb6 £>d7 42 Zb7 £}e5 43 i£Jce4 White is winning. 43...6g4 44 Zb8+ &h7 45 xg4l The most aesthetic choice, though 45 Zdd8 Wxh2+ 46 <&fl Wh3+ 47.g2 also worked. 45->xg4 46 Edd8 Ee8 Or if instead 46...£'h6 47 Zh8+ &g5 48 h4+ etc. 47 Exe8 &d8 48 Mbxd8 &h6 49 h4 1-0 Sometimes the exploitation of a weak square can justify minor sacrifices, as in the following two examples. In a typical Benoni position White is just about to dislodge the knight on e5 by f3-f4- Petrosian finds a timely antidote. 15...C4! Preparing...£>c5 with focus on the d3square. The fact that White can now win a pawn is less relevant. 16 f 4?! With hindsight 16.e3, preparing £kl2 and Scl, was a safer choice. There can follow 16...£)c5 17 £>d2 C31 18 bxc3 bxc3 and Black keeps the initiative. In contrast, 17...£>cd3?! permits the exchange sacrifice 18 £ixd3 2)xd3 19 £>xc4! £)xei 20 Wxel when the worst is over for White. 16... d3 17 &xd3 cxd3 18 xd3 2)C5 White has won a pawn, but now he is faced with the strong plan of....a6 and...<2)d3. 19 ®dl £.a6 20 £fl Returning the pawn in order to parry the enemy plan.

By the text Farago prepares to meet 15 -&.C4 by 15...d5; however, thanks to having played 14 e3 instead of 14 e4, Lputian now finds yet another great diagonal for the bishop. 15 -&d31 £k6 Or 15...d5 16 Hdl! £k6 17.&f5 Wf7 18 a41 with a strong attack.

From now on the absence of the light-squared bishop is very strongly felt in Black's camp. 16...Hd8 16...O-O-O?? obviously fails to 17 ita6 mate, while after 16...g6 17 &C4 We7 18 &d6 Wg7 19 We4+ kel 20 £e6!

Example 192 S.Lputian-I.Farago Yerevan 1982 Black has just played...We7-e4 in the battle revolves around the d5-square. 19 We4+! Instead of recovering the exchange, Lputian continues the attack. 19—We7 20 £xd7+! A key move, that breaks through the black defence. Incidentally, both 19... e7 and 19..-fi.e7 would have run into the same reply. 20...5xd7 21 Wxc6 Sg8 22 2d6 Hg7 22...Wxd6 23.xd6.xd6 was a bit more tenacious, although 24 Wc8+! 2d8 25 We6+ &f8 26 Wxf6+ <£e8 27 We6+ &f8 28 ftgS soon leads to a win for White. 23 Se6 Finally White regains the material, with interest. 23...Wxe6 24 Wxe6+ Hge7 25 Wc6 Black resigned. What methods are available when the weak square is on our own side? If possible, of course, we are happy to get rid of it, as in the following example. 22...Wb7l By attacking the e4-pawn Black gets ready for the liberating...d6-d5 advance. 23 £jd5 In the section on improving the knight we already observed that protected squares should be occupied by pieces, not by pawns, and the latter is indeed what is going to happen here. However, after 23 f3 d5l 24 exd5 £}xd5 White would lose any trace of an advantage; e.g. 25 2dl? Wa7l or 25 £jxd5 J.xd5 26 J.xd5 2xd5 with complete equality. 23...JxdS Black should hurry with these exchanges before White secures the d5square by Hdl. 24 J.xd5 £>xd5 25 exd5?l A lesser evil was 25 Wxd5 Wxd5 26 exd5, swapping the active black queen.

Here is one more example. Example 194 l.lvanisevic-D.Solak Belgrade 2002 27...5ab8! Parrying the threat of 28 b4 with a transposition to a queen endgame where the b-pawn would be a big asset for White. Now, in contrast, 28 Hxa5?! Wxb2 leaves the latter with a weak pawn on c3. 28Wd2 &g7 29 f4?

In contrast, stereotypical play with 16 Hael? permits 16„.£)d7!, followed by...£)e5,...£.d7 and...Eae8, when only Black can be better. 16...Sd8 16...Ge8 takes the knight away from the desired d7-e5 route, and after 17 Ef3 -fi.d7 18 £k3 h5 (preparing...JleS) 19.fi.gS! &.d4+ (not 19..Jii.f6? 20 Exf6 £)xf6 21 Hfl etc) 20 &hl f6 21 Jlh4, followed by Safi, White has an evident initiative.

Black gives up the plan of occupying e5 but manages to slow down the game; e.g. 21 Sf3 £.d7 22 Hefl f6, preparing...Hf8 and...£)g7-e8-d6, with an inferior but solid game. 20&hl&g7 23 g4l A key move that leaves the enemy knight without a proper destiny. 23 Sefl!? was equally promising, when both 23...Bf8? 24 g4 and 23...£ig3+ 24 £xg3 £xg3 25 Hxf7+ g8 26 e51, followed by.xg6, lead to big trouble.

Example 203 I.Hakki-M.Chokshi Dubai 2004 In the previous example the white cpawns weren't just doubled, they were also isolated which made them very vulnerable. Here, in contrast, Black's c-pawns aren't isolated, but the location of his d-pawn at d5 implies that they are chronically weak anyway. In the following play, White sus- 13 d2! Since 13 £a3?

Example 204 V.Sokolov-N.Karakiajic Yugoslav Championship, Sarajevo 1958 In this typical position from the Open Spanish, White's main plan is to take control of the dark squares, in particular d4 and c5- Black, on the other hand, aims at a liberating...C7-C5 advance. 17 2>b3 Heading for d4 and unblocking the rook on dl.

His knights are monstrous, whereas the entire black army has been deprived of any prospects. 23- Ed8 24 &h2 We7 25 a3 g6 26 d4 Eb8 27 Wc3 In the further course of the game, Hakki applied more or less the following plan: a prophylactic king march to a2, a rook transare strongly met by 18 £lbd4, seizing the centre. 18 axb3l The correct recapture, in order to clear the a-file for the rook and enable a future b3-b4 with a grip on the dark squares. In contrast, the stereotypical 18.xb3?! permits 18...Had8, when the...c7-cS advance proves inevitable; e.g. 19 £)d4 £ixd4 20 cxd4 C51 21 dxcs Wxc5 22 Had Wb6, followed by 23...d4, with complete equality. 18...C6?! Overprotecting the dS-pawn, but this leads Black into a rather passive position. The active 18...C51 was called for; e.g. 19 £xfS &xf5 20 Hxds.£e6 21 Hd6.&xb3 22 Hdxa6 Hxa6 23 Hxa6.ds with some compensation for the pawn. 19 b41 the eS-pawn some extra support. 20 itxf S?l.xfS is less convincing; e.g. 21 Hel.Jlg4! or 21 d4 WxeS 22 WxeS HxeS 23 £>xc6 He2 with counterplay. 20...£jg7 Karaklajic saves the better of his minor pieces, aware that after 2O...Wc7?l 21.&xf5,&xf5 22 £>d4 White would be clearly better. One future plan is f2-f4, g2-g4 and f4-f5, advancing the kingside majority; another is •Sb3-C5, attacking the a6-pawn. 21We3! From e3 the queen doesn't just complicate the...c6-cS advance, she also eyes the h6-square. The immediate 21 £)d4 permits 21...c5 22 bxcS WxcS and Black frees his game to some extent. 21...tg4 Asking the question of the knight. The attempt to prepare...c6-cS by 21...Hec8? fails to 22 Wh6 with a decisive 23 £lgS next. 22 2id4 C5 23 bxc5 Avoiding 23 5te6?l Wd71 24 WxcS Hac8 25 Hxa6 He6 and the knight is trapped. 23...Wxc5 A strong advance that fixes a whole complex of weaknesses on c5, aS, c6 and a6. Thanks to the b-pawns being doubled, if Black plays...c6-c$ at any moment, White can capture on c5 without ending up with a weak pawn on c3, which was his problem in the 17 b4 subline above. 19...g6 20 Hel! Some useful prophylaxis. Sokolov plans jLxfS followed by £>d4 with a "good knight vs. bad bishop" scenario, but first he gives At first sight Black isn't doing so badly; however, Sokolov has a tactical twist. 24 5! Wxe3 The only move, in view of the impending fork on h6. Miscellaneous 25 xe3 &e6 26 Eedl The virtue of White's little combination is evident: the dS-pawn has become exposed. 26...Eed8 27 Ed4l Before attacking the weakness on dS, it should be blocked. In contrast, 27 JLb3? permits 27...d41 and Black solves all his problems. 27...a5 28 Eadi Now the dS-pawn is doomed, whereas White also has a good plan in f2-f4, g2-g4 and f4-f5, advancing his kingside majority.

When about to double our pawns, we usually capture towards the centre, like Sokolov's a2xb3 in the previous example. However, as we will see next, this is not always the best solution. Example 205 E.Sveshnikov-V.Balashov USSR Championship, Moscow In this French position Black has just played 9...Wc7, attacking the eS-pawn. How should White react? 10.xg6? When making this move Sveshnikov perhaps overlooked, or underestimated Black's reply. Correct was 10 We2 with a balanced

10...fxg6! Violating the principle of capturing towards the centre, but with good reason: the f-file is opened for the black pieces, the king will feel very safe on g8, and the...g6-g5 advance will be an asset in the future. In contrast, the stereotypical 10...hxg6?l can be met by 11.&g5, preventing O-O-O and preparing £>bd2-b3-d4 with a certain dark square dominance. Il£f4 White brings his bishop to g3 where it will reinforce the kingside and the eSpawn, but also leaves the gl-a7 diagonal in the opponent's hands. More natural seems 11 JLe3, challenging the enemy bishop, when Black could consider ll..Jle7! 12 £)bd2 O-O 13 -&-d4 gSl, preparing...g5-g4 as well as,.jLe8-g6. Just like 19 b4 in the previous example, an advance with the front doubled pawn proves to be an excellent idea. In contrast, with one of the g-pawns still on f7, then 13...g5?l would be much less tempting due to the exposure of the king. 11...O-O 12 £.g3 £te7!

After 15 Wd21 &xb3 16 axb3 aS, followed by...Wb6 and perhaps...d5-d4, Black's advantage is beyond any doubt, but White is suffering less than in the game. 15...Wb6! This leaves the white queen awkwardly tied to the pin along the dl-a4 diagonal. 16 Wc2Sac8 17Se2 17...h6! Finally Balashov exploits the...g6-g5 resource to step up the kingside pressure. Here and later, I7...d4l? was interesting as well. 18 h3 g5 19 &h2Sc7! Aware that the opponent can't undertake much, Black takes his time and enables a doubling of rooks at some useful moment. 20 el?l Sveshnikov desires to liberate himself by £)ei-d3, but now his position turns unstable, something that Balashov immediately exploits.

Another reasonable idea when possessing doubled pawns is simply to get rid of them. Here is one example. Miscellaneous 13— b6 14 dxc4?! This capture just helps the black bishop reach the long diagonal. 14 fidl was preferable, when 14...WdS 15 b3 cxd3 16 cxd3 c5, preparing...Wc6 and...£ki5, seems slightly better for Black.

In his search for counterplay Gligoric decides to advance his doubled pawns in order to hit the enemy camp and clear the position for the bishop pair. Il...d4! At first sight a surprising move since the white knight is invited to the excellent e4square, but only in this way the black plan can be accomplished. The immediate 11...C4? is mistaken due to 12 d4 c5 13 -&.e31 - Gligoric, when Black admittedly gets rid of his doubled pawns, but also loses dark square control and buries the light-squared bishop. 12 &e4 C41 Softening up the white pawn structure and enabling the future clearance of the hl-a8 diagonal for the bishop. Obviously this advance had to be effected right away, before White prevents it forever by b2-b3. 13 Aas 13 &xd4 is well met by 13...Wb6, preparing...c6-c5; e.g. 14 JS.e3 cS 15 £>f3 cxd3 16 fldl d21? 17 Sxd2 Sfd8! 18 flff2 Wxb2 with counterplay. 18...C4!

We saw a similar idea in Hracek-Almasi (p. 51). By now the...f7xe6 recapture doesn't cause us any surprise, yet its impact on the battle is enormous. Having been deprived of the ds-square. White ends up lacking a constructive plan, whereas Black has quite an easy play on the fragile enemy queenside.

Blockade A powerful strategical weapon is the blockade By placing one of our pieces in front of an enemy pawn, we don't just prevent the advance of that pawn, we also limit the movements of its fellow pieces. These observations go back to Nimzowitsch, who also noticed that the blocking piece itself tends to be rather well placed, at least in the case of a central or bishop's pawn. So far in this book we have seen numerous blockades; e.g. in Mikhalevski-Ehlvest (p. 57), Kharlov-Villavicencio (p. 98), Spassky-Karpov (p. 162), and Ivanisevic- Solak (p. 237), just to name a few. In the following we will see some more examples on how to create a blockade and take advantage of it afterwards. Example 209 P.Van der Sterren-LLjubojevic Amsterdam 1999 Ljubojevic creates a passed pawn but also lets his opponent install a powerful blockade, one that will drastically change the strategical balance. Preferable was either 2O...cxb4 21 Wxb4 J&.a6! 22 C>d4 Wb6 with just a slight disadvantage - Donev, or the sharper 2O...d41? 21 exd4 cxd4 22 flel Wg4 with complex play. 21 d4! Wg6 22 £xe4 Wxe4 23 b5 The tremendous knight on d4 doesn't just prevent...d5-d4, it also severely restricts the bishop on b7. Meanwhile, the passed pawn on C4 is unlikely to advance, whereas White may soon create one of his own on the b-file. 23..>g6 Preparing...a7-a6 in order to activate the rook on a8.

For this reason the white knight is currently short of prospects. With his next move Van der Sterren addresses this issue. 20 b4! A typical counter-strike in this structure, which weakens the hanging pawns and gains some dark square control. In fact, we already came across it in Aagaard-Akesson (p. 201) and Hansen-Tiviakov (p. 217). In contrast, after 20 £xe4?l dxe4 21 £>d2 fid 3!

Example 210 A.Kovchan-V.Malaniuk Swidnica 1999 has stabilized, White has time for a major regrouping of his pieces. The rooks will be doubled on the d-file and the knight switches to f4 or c3 in order to exert maximum pressure on the dS-pawn. Meanwhile, Black can't do very much. 28...Ed6 29 e2 Ee4 3OSfdl Wd8 31Sd4l In the absence of Black's other minor pieces, the rook can take up the blocking task. 31...He5 Or 31-fixd4 32 Wxd4, preparing £>e2-c3 and e3-e4. 3 2Wd2Wc7 The immediate 32...Sg6 is well met by the prophylactic 33 g3, just like in the game. 33&C3 Finally White is ready for the tactical shot 34 e4. We saw a similar idea in Kharkov-Villavicencio (p. 98). 33...fig6? This attacking try leads nowhere after Van der Sterren's simple reply, so 33--f5. complicating e3-e4, was a better choice. White can now win a pawn by 34 f4 Ee8 35 £}xd5 -&xd5 36 Hxd5, but after 36...C3 Black obtains some counterplay. Thus the prophylactic 34 h3!?, preparing f2-f4, might be more accurate.

Nevertheless, its impact has been strongly felt during the whole game. 45-.fi.f6 46 fif8 1 In view of 46....fi.e7 47 Sf7+, Black resigned. So far we have mainly seen blockades being performed by pieces, in particular by knights. A different kind of blockade, less active but still rather useful, is that conducted with pawns. We already saw in Gligoric-Benko (p. 175) Black trying (in vain) to keep his kingside closed by 2 3-f5. Here is a more successful case. 30 f6! A strong pawn sacrifice that clears the light squares towards the black king.

Before taking concrete action on "his" flank, Petrosian applies a clever prophylactic measure on the queenside. The white king is now under a cloud. There followed 27 We3 d7 (27...g31 was even stronger - Marin) 28.xd6 ' 'xd6 29 Sd4?l e51 30 Sd2 f 51 (vacating f6 for the knight) 31 exd5 f4 32 We4 &f6 33 Wf5+ &b8 34 f3 -&.C8! 35 Wbl g3 36 Sei h3 with a 18...a6! decisive attack. From now on, Black will always respond to a4-a5 by...b6-b5, and to b4-b5 by...a6-a5, thus keeping the queenside closed. Aware that his attack is no longer viable, Spassky resorts to defensive play. 19...5dg8 20 Hgl Sg4 21 Wd2 Shg8 22 a5 b5! Of course. This entire method of placing the pawns next to each other in preparation for a blockade can evidently be applied on any part of the board, and is rather frequent in practice. 23 Sadi £f8l With the strong plan of 24 -f6 2 5 exf6 e5. 24 &h2? As discovered by Tigran Petrosian many years ago, sometimes the goal of establishing a blockade can justify the sacrifice of a whole exchange. Typically the rook is sacrificed for the enemy bishop of the same colour as the blocking square. In fact we recently saw Black trying to achieve this in T al-Gligoric, and here is another example. Example 217 J.Hellsten-P.Cramling Malmo 1996 In a King's Indian battle Black has great compensation for the pawn. Her bishop changed completely. Black won the exchange but ended up with a bad bishop and a lack of any dynamics whatsoever. On the other hand, White may soon establish a strong blockade on e4 with a knight, where it will dominate the whole board. 24-.fi.f6 Preparing 25-.fi.h4 in order to get rid of the bad bishop, but White easily parries this idea with his next move. A different solution for this bishop is 24...e4'.?, eliminating the blockade, although after 25 £idxe4, preparing a2-a3 and £>b5-d4 with focus on e6. White is much better anyway. 25 &hl!.fi.h4 26 fi-gl Sf7 27 £ide4 flg8 pair is strong, the semi-open g- and h-files will be useful in an attack, and the pawns on e$ and f5 control the centre. Only the arrival of the knight at d3 is missing for a complete initiative; e.g. 21 a3?l d3 22 Sc2 Wh4 23 We2 e4. So, how should White cover the d3square? The natural 21 We2 drops the exchange after 21...f4 followed by 22....fi.d3; while if 21 £>dbl, then 21...e41 and the knight gets to d3 anyway, leaving its counterpart misplaced on bl. 21 We2! Anyway. I still remember a certain pleasure when making this move, one that Petrosian must have felt many times. 21...f4? The correct choice in terms of material, but positionally deficient. Black should have tried 21...e4! 22 fxe4 fxe4 instead, when 23 £ib5!?, heading for d4, seems to hold the balance; e.g. 23... d3 24 Hcdl followed by <£>d4, or 2 3.. xa2 24 ficel £>c3 25 £)xc3.xc3 26 Wg4 and Black's bishop pair compensates for the slightly exposed king. 22 Jlf2.fi.d3 Or 22...£>d3 23 Scdl, followed by £ide4 with a big advantage. 23 Wdl i.xfl 24 Wxfl In just a few moves the position has Black is logically preparing a kingside attack, but unfortunately some of her key attacking pieces are no longer present on the board, such as the light-squared bishop and the other knight. We will soon see that once the g2-pawn enjoys sufficient protection, the black attack cannot progress. In contrast, White has a rather automatic plan of action on the other flank. 28 a 3 2>a6 29 Sc2l Sg6 30 Sb2 Preparing b3-b4 and C4-C5 with an attack at the base of the enemy pawn chain. We saw a similar, though less successful case in Zvjaginsev-Polgar (p. 182). 3O...Wd8 3 1 b4 axb4 32 axb4 -fi.e7 Miscellaneous A more active task is desirable for this bishop, but after 32..Jlg3?! 33 c5 Wh4 34 c6 bxc6 35 dxc6! &b8 36 b5 Hh6 37 h3, followed by 38 £id5 or 38 Wc4, White is practically winning. In contrast, the simple 32...£ib8!? 33 c5 d7 improving the knight was reasonable. 33 C5 &b8 34 Wc4 h8? In heavy time trouble Cramling overlooks a minor tactical resource that will accelerate the white advance. 34...Bfg7 was preferable, intending 35 c6?l bxc6 36 dxc6 d51 followed by 37...Hxc6 with counterplay. Thus White should rather try 35 cxd6 cxd6 36 b5, followed by 37 b6 and $}b5-c7-e6, or even 35 bsl? at once. 3 5 b5l Now that 35 -dxc5? fails to 36 d6. Black can't stop a white pawn from reaching c6. 35...5.7 Saving the knight from eternal imprisonment. After 35—flfg7 36 c6 Black is strategically doomed; e.g. 36...Wg8 37 Wa2 b6 38 g4l fxg3 39 hxg3 Bh6+ 40 Hh2 Bgh7 41 Bxh6 Hxh6+ 42 &g2 'S'cS 43 £rf2, when the sad knight on b8 means that White's victory is only a matter of time. 36 c6!

Black resigned. For the related exercises to this section, see page 358. The initiative In the first chapter I defined the initiative as "some kind of major influence on the battle, without necessarily being an advantage in itself'. Typically we understand an "advantage" as something tangible, at least for the coming 10-15 moves; e.g. more space, a weak enemy pawn, the bishop pair, the opponent's unsafe king, etc. In contrast, the initiative easily evaporates within a few moves if not sustained. Thus the side with the initiative typically tries to create new threats all the time, and doesn't shy away from material or positional concessions in order to keep the initiative going. AH this might sound a little abstract, so let's look at some examples. Example 218 T.V.Petrosian-A.Karpov USSR Championship, Moscow 1974 In this apparently peaceful position, reminiscent of the Queen's Gambit Accepted, Petrosian hurries to take the initiative. Ile4l&bd7 12 es! Accepting doubled pawns in order to increase tbe pressure.

In endgames with an extra exchange, it is generally a good idea to swap the opponent's remaining rook. White later won. Example 219 P.Svidler-A.Dreev Russian Championship, Elista Due to his privilege of making the first move, it could be argued that White has a slight initiative from the very beginning of the game. In the above position Black has a sound pawn structure and by castling on the next move he would reach a satisfactory game; e.g. 12 b3?l O-O 13.e3 £ia6, followed by...€k5. Svidler finds a more energetic continuation. 12 f41 h6 The threat of 13 f5 had to be parried, and 12...f6? failed to 13 £ie6. 13 f 5 -fi.h7 14 C5l By now the initiative has been converted into a more stable advantage: a strong passed pawn on f7 supported by the bishop pair. In view of these long term assets, Petrosian is happy to exchange queens. 19 Wxe7 1 JLxe7 20 £rt>5 1 Heading for the weak square on e6. 2O..J2ac8 A lesser evil was 2O..JXfc8 21.b3 _fi.cS, preventing the knight transfer to e6, although after 22?id4.fi.xd4 23 fixd4 White Miscellaneous At the right moment, before the black king castles away from the vulnerable efile. 14...€>6d7 After 14...&XC5 15 Hel+, both 15-£.e7 16 f6! gxf6 17 &xh6, intending 17-. 8d7? 18 £xc6, and 15„.3?f8 16 JLe3 £>a6 17 £)e4 yield White clear compensation for the pawn - Svidler. 15 g5!

Black's strong fianchettoed bishop and the weak pawn on b5 would yield him a long-term advantage if he could just manage to consolidate; e.g. 17 O-O?! O-O followed by..JZfb8. Therefore White is urged to act quickly. 17 e 5! A strong advance that softens up the efile, the h2-b8 diagonal and the fourth rank for the white pieces.

In Petrosian-Karpov we saw how the fight for the initiative motivated minor positional concessions, such as weak squares and doubled pawns. Another common idea in practice is a minor sacrifice to obtain or maintain the initiative. Here are a few examples on this topic. Example 224 V.Topalov-I.Smirin Polanica Zdroj 1995 In a Sicilian battle Black is one move away from 19.O-O with a decent game, thanks to the strong knight on e4 that obstructs a potential enemy attack on the 19f51 A strong pawn sacrifice that puts some pressure on e6 and clears the f-file towards the black king. 19... xe5 20 fxe6 fxe6 In the event of 20...O-O, returning the pawn in order to secure the king, then 21 Sf 5! Wd6 22 £)xe4 dxe4 23 Wb3 with double threats at b7 and f7 - Ribli. After the text Black intends 21...£16 followed by...O-O, after which White's initiative would slowly evaporate.

However, White has a much stronger option at his disposal. 28 fixg7! Wxg7 29 2>xe6 Wb2 3 0 2)xc7+ The clever temporary sacrifice on g7 has left the black king without shelter. 30...&d7 31Wxb2 Also strong was 31 £)b8+! 2xb8 32 Wg4+ &d8 33 £>e6+, followed by decisive checks on g8 and c7 31—£>xb2 3 2 £>es+ &d6 33 Stf7+ &d7 34 2>e5+l? White wins with ease after 34 £ixh8.fi.d6 35 xa6.fi.xa6 36 Eal, followed by Sa7+, but T opalov doesn't want to suspend the attack yet. 34-&d6 35 -fi-f4 2f8 Or 35.-2g8 36 $te4+*d7 37 xb2 d4 38.fi.g3 -fi.d6 39 £>a41, hanging on to the extra piece - Krasenkow. 36 £k4+ &d7 37 £>b6+!

In contrast, the natural 21 cxd4?l runs into 21...£)h4! 22 £)xh4 Wxd4+ 23 Jte3 ®xe4 24 Wxe4 Sxe4 with a slightly better endgame for Black - Kaidanov. 21..6e5 The only move, since both 21...&xg7? 22 £g5 and 21...®h4? 22 Wg3 £)xe4 23 Wg4 win for White.

In contrast, after 13...g5 14 -fig3 £)xe4 15 £ixe4 Sxe4 16 £)a5l?

Fortunately White's position still has a lot of potential. 24Wb3fid8 Or 24.„&b6 25 &-C3, preparing fiael. 25>xb7 ®f6 A critical position has arisen. In view of every move. As I mentioned in the first chapter, it is simply impossible to conduct the strategical battle without paying attention to tactical details. For example, we saw on several occasions how a superior position was converted into victory by means of an opportune use of tactical arms, as in Pelletier-Sebag (p. 44), Kasparov-Martinovic (p. 136), 5hort-Kasparov (p. 205), and Hall- Hjelm (p. 243), to name just a few. In the following, we will have a look at some examples where the link between tactics and strategy is particularly explicit. To start with, here are a few cases where a lack of tactical considerations led one of the players into disaster. Example 228 O.Renet-B.Zuger Leukerbad 1992 Activity above material. In contrast, after 31 Sxc5?!.xc3 32 bxc3 Hh7! Black is still alive. 31...h5 31...&XC3 32 bxc3 £>f6 33 Hf4 Hd6 was slightly more tenacious, although after 34 Sa8+! £g7 35 Sa7+ &f8 36 &c4 White wins. 3 2 fif4+ &g8 3 3 £c4+ &h7 3 4 Ef7 In view of 34..Hhg8 35 Saa7, Black resigned. For the related exercises, see page 361. The link between tactics and strategy When I was a kid and a newcomer to this game, I often heard older and more experienced players make a division of chess players into two different groups: tacticians and positional players. However, I soon noticed in my own games that the supposed tacticians would often find good squares for their pieces, seize open files and effect favourable exchanges, while the "positional" players weren't that bad at forks and pins after all. Many years later, my experience tells me that every game contains a high amount of both tactical and strategical challenges, and these are often closely related and intertwined. Therefore both strategy and tactics have to be mastered in order to aspire to any success, no matter what our personal style. As for a classification of chess players, if such is really needed then Dvoretsky's division into "intuitive" and "scientific" players probably makes more sense. Now let's talk a little more about the link between tactics and strategy in chess. As you have noticed, despite the strategical focus of this book, its examples are filled with tactical considerations, on almost In atypical French battle Black desires to transfer his bishop on d7 to a more active post on h5, but he chose the wrong moment. 2O...£e8?? A prophylactic measure such as 2O...Wc7 was called for. Miscellaneous 21 £xf6! After 21...gxf6 22 b4 the other bishop is trapped, so Black resigned.

At last White achieves his desired queen check. 21...f6 22 Wg3+?xh7 23 bxa3 With a decisive material advantage. Example 230 T.Wall-C.Ward White has just played e4-e5, with some Wrexham 1998 attacking prospects. 17....xf3?? Before moving his knight Black aims at eliminating the potential attacker on f3. Just like 2O....e8 in the previous example, his idea is strategically well founded but tactically flawed. 18 exf6! Another intermediate move, and there are more to come. At this moment Black in fact resigned, but let's see how the game could have concluded. 18... xa3 Or 18,...xe2 19 fxe7, winning a piece. The text leaves both queens en prise, but White finds a clever way of withdrawing his one with check. White has adopted some kind of Hedgehog with reversed colours. Now the dynamic 20 d41 was called for; e.g. 20... e4 21 £>e5! £ixb4 22.a3 aS 23 £ic4, recovering the pawn with a slight initiative. 20 i.c3? A natural move that protects the b4pawn and prepares Wb2 with increased pressure on eS- However, Black possesses a little tactical trick that will yield him a clear strategical superiority. 20...&d4! can also be used for reaching different strategical objectives, such as improving a piece, creating weaknesses in the enemy camp, etc. In fact we just witnessed this in Wall-Ward, and the book contains several other cases on the same topic, such as Yudovich-Klaman with 26 IXa5 (p. 61), Piket- Timman with 12.h3 (p. 103), Hellsten- Llorens with 24 £>e4 (p. 110), and Sokolov- Karaklajic with 24 £)f5 (p. 251). Here are some more examples. Example 231 A.AIekhine-M.Euwe World Championship (game 1), Holland 1935 21 £xd4 After 21 exd4 exd4 the piece is regained with serious damage to White's pawn structure. 21...exd4 22 e4 5ac8 Heading for the entry square at c3. 23 Hxc8 Sxc8 24 Hcl Sc3! After the departure of the dark-squared bishop, there is nobody in the white camp covering this square. 25 £dl?l A misguided attempt for counterplay, but White's position was difficult anyway. 25...EXC1 26 Wxcl Yfxb4 27 Wc7 Wbl 28 h4 Wxdl+ 29 &h2 ®xd3 30 Wb8+ £f8 31 Wxb7 Wa3 Black soon realized his material advantage. At first sight the position seems roughly level, but Alekhine finds a clever way of intertwining tactics and strategy, one that will lead the opponent into difficulties. 19 b4! Initiating a minority attack, with focus on the c6-pawn. Unfortunately for Black, the pawn cannot be taken: 19...Wxb4?? fails to 20 &.xe5, while after 19.Ji.xb4?! 20 £>b3 Wc7 21 We4!.&d6 22 Wd4 he is forced into 22...g5 23 Ji.xg5 with an ugly position. 19...WC7 20 b 5!

Supported by a tactical variation White seizes the sixth rank and prepares fledi with complete control of the open file. 22...C4 In a typical position from the Spanish White is basically aiming at a kingside attack, whereas Black tries to create counterplay on the opposite flank. 17 2>g3 Heading for the ideal square on f 5. 17...g6 18 f5!

Example 234 P.Popovic-J.Timman Belgrade 1987 19 Jta4l Aware that after 19-.gxf5?! 20 WxfS the piece is regained. White improves his bishop and releases the pin along the c-file. 19...bxc3 20 &h6+ &g7 A vulnerable square for the king, but 20...'S?h8? obviously failed to 21.&xd7.

Here is a less dramatic case. In a Sicilian battle Black has just retreated his knight by 17..£)d7 in order to improve it via e5-c4. Popovic now alters the position in his favour by means of a well-known tactical trick. 18£)d5lWxd2 After 18...Wd8? 19 2>xe7 xe7 20 Hfdl the dark-squared bishop is sorely missed in Black's camp. 19 £xd2 Now the point of 18 £}ds is easily appreciated: after I9...exds?l 20 exds White regains the piece with a clear positional plus, while 19-.Ji.xd5 20 exds eS 21 aS! also fa- Miscellaneous vours him - Popovic. 19*—&d8 20< b4> Depriving the opponent of the bishop pair, after which it will be easier to attack his queenside. 20...£f6 After 2O....a5?l 21 2fdl the d6-pawn becomes exposed. 21 xc6 bxc6 22 Sabi Sab8 23 b3 d5 24 HfdlSkS?' 24-d4 was preferable, when White could try 25 e5l? £)xe5 26 f4, followed by £xc6 - Popovic. 25 -£e3! -&e7 The a7-pawn must stay on the board. 26 exds cxd5 27 c41 Creating a passed pawn and clearing some space for the fianchettoed bishop. 27.. -dxc4 28 bxc4 Exbl After 28...£ixa4?! 29 Sxb8 Hxb8 30 Hal! the rook reaches the seventh rank. 29 Exbl With the plan of a5-a6, JLb7 and Hb5- White is clearly better.

White would like to make progress with his passed pawn, but after 2 5 d6?< Bc6 it is not evident how the enemy blockade can be broken, besides which the d6-pawn might become exposed after..JLf8 at some moment. Tregubov finds a cleverer solution. 25 Ae7l Exploiting the tactical trick ZS.-Wxe?? 26 d6, White installs his bishop on the obstructive e7-square, where it will make a strong duo with the d-pawn after d5-d6. 25...h5 25..JLf8 drops a pawn after 26 £xf8 Hxf8 27 Wxe5, while the active 25 - Sc2 26 d6 Sxb2?l runs into 27 Had!

The consequent 29-f5 was called for, when 30 Wf7 keeps the initiative - Golubev. 3OWd5l Example 23 7 A.Karpov-A.Shirov Biel 1992 Miscellaneous At first sight White doesn't seem to have achieved much in this position from the Semi-Slav; e.g. 21 £)f 5 Wc51? 22 Wxc5 Jl.xcS 23 fiacl £lf8, intending....&c8-e6, with a solid game for Black. 21 sixes! A very concrete approach. Giving up the bishop pair hardly makes any sense in itself, but Karpov has anticipated that, in connection with a specific tactical line, it will help him to provoke chronic weaknesses on the black kingside. 21...®xe5 After 21...fxe5?l 22 i.f3 White has a pleasant advantage thanks to the strong base on e4. hl-a8 diagonal for the bishop but also lets White bring a new piece into the attack. 25 axb5 axb5 26 Ka7l Wc7 Or 26...Wb8 27 £)e7+ &h8 28 ilf5!

To finish with, let's see a few cases where tactical resources support strategical goals of a more defensive nature. 22 £d3lh6 Unfortunately for Black, after 22...g6 23 Jt.xg6! hxg6 24 xg6+ hS 25 Wh6+! S gS 26 £)h5! the double threat of 27 Wg7 mate and 27 £)xf6+ cannot be parried. Thus Shirov is forced to weaken a whole complex of kingside light squares, which are immediately exploited by his opponent. 23 £.g6l£f8 24 2tf5c5 After 24...&.C8 25 £)h4l the threat of 26.£h7+ followed by £)g6(+) is highly unpleasant; eg. 25->g5 26,fih7+ &f7 27 £rf31, when the white queen enters decisively on either g6 or c6. The text clears the Example 238 A.Moiseenko-V.Bologan FIDE World Championship, Tripoli In the Hedgehog-like position above Black has a problem with completing his development. The natural 15..-& b7? drops a pawn after 16 Wxd7, while both iS...d6 and 15...Wc7 lead to the same result after 16 £ib5. Finally, the prophylactic IS—a6 runs into 16 £)e41 Wc7 17 C)d6, preventing...d7d6, with a firm advantage. Again some minor tactics help Black in his defensive labour. By vacating the f7square for the rook with tempo he secures the d7-pawn. There was no other way of keeping the material balance; e.g. 18....f6 19 b4 or 18...Wf6 19 Wc21 with double threats at h7 and d7. 19 £.f3 Sf7 20 Ec3 Wc7 21 Sd3 Sd8 At last the d7-pawn is safe. White can't undertake much at this point, and a draw was agreed just a few moves later. Example 239 M.Tal'A.Suetin Sochi 1973 15...£g5l Bologan has observed a minor tactical detail that will solve all his problems. 16 e3£.b7! The point. With the bishop on f3 hanging in the air White has no time to capture the d7-pawn, while an exchange on b7 would leave the pawn defended by the rook. 17 ®e4 After 17 J.xb7 Hxb7 18 £ie4 &.e7, the formerly strong 19 &d6 proves harmless after 19...jLxd6 20 Wxd6 Wf6, followed by 21...5.8 and 22...Sbc7 with counterplay. As for 19 Zc3 Hc7 20 Sd3, increasing the pressure on d7, with 2O...Wa8! Black once more uses tactical resources to mobilize his pieces: 21 Sxd7? now drops the knight after 21...5.d7 22 Wxd7 Sd8, while other moves are met by 21...Ed8 with a solid game. 17...-& xe4 18 ±xe4 The threat of 19 Wxd7 has been renewed. 18...f5l Miscellaneous Black has a problem on the dark squares and his e6-pawn is weak. By exploiting some minor tactics Suetin manages to transform the position in his favour. 2O...e5! A surprising advance. Now neither 21 JLxeS??.xc5+, nor 21 Wxe5?? 'xe5 22 JLxe5.xc5+ works for White, so he is forced to obstruct himself on the al-h8 diagonal and the e-file. 21 fxe5 £g6 Connecting the rooks and seizing some light squares with the bishop. 22 e3 pies, such as Zvjaginsev-Polgar (p. 182), sometimes a space advantage can tum out to be more of a liability than an asset. 31Hf2 Or 31 £K4 £.d3 32 Bel 2f8! with a strong attack - Suetin. 3 l..J5dl+ 3 2 fifl Sxfl+I Here the game continued 32...fid3? 33 h4! Sa3 34 h5, when White obtained counterplay and eventually even won. 33&xfl Wxa2 Black finally recovers the pawn, with some advantage thanks to his active pieces and the insecure white king. Example 240 V.Bologan-S.Rublevsky Dortmund 2004 22...h6! Preparing 23...£g5 in order to activate the other bishop as well. Despite his extra pawn, the position is slowly becoming unpleasant for White, whose knight is no longer particularly useful on b6. 23 Hxf8+ Bxf8 24 Efl Ed81?

As we observed in some earlier examln this French-like structure White has just played 22 g4 with the clear intention of 2 3 f5, attacking the enemy king.

Exploiting the fact that 23 JLxcS?? runs into 23 -d4+, Rublevsky manages to swap the important enemy bishop on d4, whose departure will leave the e5-pawn more vulnerable and facilitate Black's counterplay 25..J.xd3 26 cxd3 Eac8 27 &e3?

Exercises The following exercises will help you to put into practice the concepts studied earlier in the book. Each block of exercises is related to a specific theoretical section, thus it makes sense to solve them once you have finished the corresponding section. The vast majority of these exercises is conformed by middlegame positions, with a few opening and endgame positions as a complement. Logically these examples are shorter and less detailed than the explanatory examples featured earlier in the book, yet on many occasions I have continued the examples far after the supposed finish of the solution, due to their instructive content. In most cases I am asking for a 1st move + short plan. The latter can be anything from a general idea ("dear the bl-h7 diagonal for the bishop", "swap the defender on f6" etc), a specific plan or manoeuvre ("intending £)d2-b3-a5 with pressure on c6") to a concrete sequence of moves ("in order to meet l...£)ds with 2 £)xd5 cxd5 3 Hcl seizing the open file"). Sometimes you will have to evaluate one or two options, and in a number of complex positions concrete variations are required, e g. 3-4 complete moves. Depending on the level of each exercise (they are presented in ascending order of difficulty) you will probably need between 5 and 20 minutes to find the solution. If your solution doesn't coincide with the one in the book, don't despair - the main thing is to grasp the general idea, and if you haven't, then give yourself more time for the next position. On the other hand, you might have found an even better solution, who knows! On some occasions I have included 1st move alternatives in the solution (typically originating in suggestions from my students) that for one or another reason deserve attention. Different move orders have also been dealt with in some cases. In a few exercises the related concept is applied indirectly, e.g. preventing your opponent from making a key exchange. Finally, you might find some exercises a little easy, in particular the first ones of each section. However, in my opinion there is nothing wrong with verifying existing knowledge, just like you review a part of your opening repertoire before a tournament game. A major aim of these exercises is indeed to improve your intuition, so as to be able to apply strategical concepts more swiftly in practice. Exercises 1-20: The bishop
