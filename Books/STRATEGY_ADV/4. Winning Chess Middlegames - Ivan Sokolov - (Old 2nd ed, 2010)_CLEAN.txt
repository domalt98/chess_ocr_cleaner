: 5 Foreword by Mi chael Ad ams I think the first tourna ment that I played with Ivan Sokolov was the Oakham Young Mas ters (yes, we were young once) back in 1988. We then started to bump into each other at tourna ments on a reg u lar ba sis, be came friendly and of ten socialised to - gether fol low ing our games, sharing some glasses of wine. Our dis cus sions were many and varied and some of them were even about chess. I re mem ber one partic u lar conver sa tion where I pro posed a certain plan in a mid - dlegame po si ti o n; Ivan looked a lit tle con fused, his eyebrows started twitch ing, and he re sponded 'yes, but this is just a normal po si ti o n'. In his chess ed u cation, he had broken down struc tures into vari ous typ i cal situations and ana lysed these. The Eng - lish school of chess had a slightly more cha otic ap proach. In this book, Ivan shares the fruits of his labours, which are invalu able tools for any player. This struc tured ap proach is quite in struc tive as of ten players choose their ope ning rep er toire ac cord ing to quite hap haz ard cri te ria, ran domly pick ing up lines with out giv ing se ri ous con sid er ation to how the re sult ing mid dlegames would suit them. To re solve this problem a bit of retro-analy sis can prove help ful. By study ing the re sult ing mid dlegames and de termin ing your strengths and weak nesses, it is pos si ble to go back to the ear lier stages of the game and set out your stall ac cord ingly. The book also gives in ter est ing point ers about the di rec tion in which mod ern chess is head ing. The role of the com puter in ope ning prep a ra tion has be come all-im portant and players' homework can prog ress right from the start ing po si ti o n un til the end of the game. Read ing the book, I was very happy that I was not caught in Ivan's prepa ra tion for his game against Krasenkow featured on page 265! I ex pect his op po nent also thinks him self lucky that he diverged at an early stage. Al though the gen eral advice will be espe cially help ful to club players, other top ics covered will certainly be use ful to players of a greater strength. Un doubt edly they will make note of the orig i nal ope ning sug ges tions, as I certainly have, but also en joy the in-depth an no tations to some ex cel lent games. Club players should n't be dis - 7 heart ened if the num ber of vari ations some times seems a bit daunt ing. As you can see from Ivan's own games featured here and elsewhere, ag gres sive, chal leng ing play al - ways makes it dif fi cult un der the rig ours of a prac ti cal game to find the best de fence. The level of de fen sive play that is pos si ble at home in your study with some help ful sug ges tions from your sili con friend is rarely rep li cated in the heat of bat tle. There are also a few of Ivan's losses in this book, I know from com miser at ing with him af ter wards that some of them were quite pain ful, and he can't have en joyed re - vis it ing them for publi cation in this book. But an es sen tial part of im prove ment, from which Ivan does not shirk here, is ana lys ing what has gone wrong and be ing ob jec tive about not only the as sess ment of the po si ti o n reached from an ope ning but your un der stand ing of the re sult ing struc tures. Af ter all, most main ope ning sys tems are com pletely vi able but your mas tery of them may not be. Ivan's in tro duc tion struck a chord with me in this re spect, as I sus pect it does with most other players, as I per son ally sometimes per sisted with un suited ope ning sys - tems too long. I would jus tify my choices to my self, on the grounds that ob jec tively I had a good po si ti o n, but the sit uations aris ing did not suit my style and I was then never able to get a good grasp of them. Everyone must de cide for them selves which sys tems best serve them but this book will certainly be a great as set in making these some times hard choices. Of course armed with the knowl edge gained here you will be con sid er ably better versed in all of them. I hope you en joy read ing it as much as I did. Mi chael Ad ams, Oc to ber 2008 Win ning Chess Middlegames 8 Introduction I started work ing on this book in March, 2007. As usu ally hap pens, due to dif fer ent rea sons, it took me lon ger than my publisher and me had planned and I fin ished my work in Au gust 2008. In this book I wanted to ex plore the - in my opin ion - four most important types of pawn struc ture in chess. Quite a num ber of books on pawn struc tures have been published, and one may rightly won der what makes this book dif fer ent. Well, I have tried, as much as pos si ble, to
1. sys tem atize the the matic plans used and give clear expla nations of them, and
2. in corpo rate the ideas of the featured ope ning vari ation into the pawn struc -
ture that en sues. The lat ter is ac tu ally quite im portant. In the pre-com puter era players normally pol - ished their open ing rep ertoire over the years, and even though open ing prep a ra tion did not go nearly as far as to day, years of the o reti cal and prac ti cal ex pe ri ence brush - ing up one's rep ertoire would normally re sult in a rea son ably good strate gic un der - stand ing of the po si tions aris ing from the open ings played. In the past 15 years, the involve ment of com puter pro grams and databases has made it con sid erably eas ier to pre pare a par ticu lar varia tion for a par ticu lar op po - nent. However, thorough study and good strate gic un der stand ing of the po si tions still re mains a must in or der to cap i tal ize suc cess fully on your open ing prep a ra tion. I still re mem ber watch ing one of Anatoly Karpov's post-mortems, when he had won from some ini tially in fe rior Ruy Lopez with black. His op po nent, slightly an noyed, re marked: 'Here, af ter the ope ning, you were defi nitely worse', to which the 12th World Champion calmly replied: 'Yes, but soon I was better'. In deed, Karpov has won from quite a num ber of in fe rior po si tions (his en coun - ters with Garry Kasparov in cluded), due to his su pe rior strate gic un der stand ing of the ope nings he was play ing. Kasparov has won many Najdorfs and King's In di ans not only be cause he had the best novel ties, but be cause he fun da men tally un der stood those po si tions better than his op po nents. On the other hand he was too stubborn to ad mit that the Berlin Vari ation of the Ruy Lopez was not 'his cup of tea', which ul ti - mately cost him his World Champi on ship title against Vladimir Kramnik in 2000. Kramnik, on the other hand, be ing devas tat ing in Cata lan-type sys tems with white and Meran Slavs with black, at some stage started to opt for sharp Si cil ians with white and King's In di ans with black. That adven ture did not last very long. Nowa days he is a mer ci less killing ma chine with his Cata lans again, squeez ing out the small est of mi cro scopic advan tages, while the King's In dian with black is a long-forgotten voyage. If such mis takes are com mit ted by the world's very best, then what are we to ex pect from lesser gods? Through out my own ca reer, I have also scored rea son ably well in the po si tions I un der stood and paid the price for be ing too stub born to stay away from po si tion types that did not suit me. So the rea sons why I have tried in this book to in corpo rate the stra te gic middlegame ideas and the games which I view as im portant into the four dif fer ent types of pawn struc ture dis cussed in this book, were:
1. to provide a complete guide for the club player;
2. through a pro
cess of se ri ous analy sis of the mate rial in this book, to also give the club player a rea son ably accurate feel ing as to which partic u lar po si tions suit him and which do not; and
3. to give the club player who takes his time for a thor
ough study of this book, new stra te gic and also prac ti cal ope ning knowl edge, af ter which he will defi - nitely see a clear improve ment in his re sults. In the in tro duc tions to the four dif fer ent chap ters, I will further ex plain the dis tin - guish ing types of position, games and vari ations featured. I hope that, apart from try ing to im prove his chess skills, the reader will also sim ply en joy study ing the games selected in this book. Ivan Sokolov, Au gust 2008 Win ning Chess Middlegames Chapter 1 Doubled Pawns In tro duc tion In this chap ter, I will try to make struc tures with dou bled pawns eas ier to un der stand and ana lyse, by system atiz ing them into 12 stan dard po si tions. The 12 'Struc ture' di - agrams I have con nected with the com mented games that fol low, re flect those stan- dard po si tions, which are reached the most fre quently. As we shall see, a vast ma jority of struc tures with dou bled pawns arise from the vari ous lines with 4.e3 or with 4.a3 (the Sämisch Vari ation) of the Nimzo-In dian De fence. Apart from the fact that it is good to un der stand these po si tions in gen eral, for those who play 1.d2-d4 with white, or the Nimzo-In dian with black, the com - mented games be low will have the ad di tional prac ti cal value that they will clearly improve their ope ning knowl edge, an im prove ment that can be im me di ately imple - mented in tournament play. Struc ture 1.1 (Game 1 - Sokolov-Johansen) shows a rel- atively rarely reached type of po si tion. I have in cluded this game pri marily in or der to improve the reader's gen - eral un der stand ing. In prac tice it does not often hap pen in the Nimzo-In dian that White gets dou bled pawns while Black keeps his bishop pair. Struc ture 1.2 (Game 2 - Sokolov-Winants) and Struc - ture 1.3 (Game 3 - Gligoric-Nikolic) show what has been for many years the main line of the Nimzo-In dian. Any one who at tempts to fun da men tally im prove his chess skills needs to ana lyse these po si tions thor oughly. In the games re lated to Struc tures 1.2 and 1.3 I have tried to ex plain the pros and cons of these po si tions, which are dif fi cult to play for both sides.

Struc ture 1.6 (Game 7 - Keres-Spassky) ex plains why for White it does not have to be bad to lose his c3 pawn in po si tions with a full cen tre and dou bled pawns on c3 and c4. This idea is in use in a few Nimzo-In dian lines, and use ful to re mem ber and un der stand. Struc ture 1.7 (Game 8 - Gligoric-Ivkov, Game 9 - Vyzhmanavin-Beliavsky, and, with a mo bile cen tre: Game 10 - Z.Polgar-Sokolov, Game 11 - Sokolov- Bologan, Game 12 - Sokolov-Dizdarevic and Game 13 - Radjabov-Anand) shows a plan that is of ten seen in a dif - fer ent type of po si tion with dou bled pawns in a full-cen - tre Nimzo-In dian: Black targets (and of ten wins) White's weak c4 pawn, but by do ing this, he gets his knight tem - po rarily or perma nently stranded on the edge of the board, i.e. on the a5-square. As you will see from the games ana lysed, most of the time White gets plenty of ini tia tive on the kingside to compen sate for the loss of his c4 pawn, but the game re mains dou ble-edged and White has to be en ergetic and ac cu rate in devel op ing and exe - cut ing his kingside at tack.

Struc ture 1.9 (Game 15 - Botvinnik-Chekhover and Game 16 - Kuzubov-Van der Wiel) shows an im portant stra te gic idea for White. He does not mind making the cen tre static, seem ingly iso lat ing his c4 pawn weak ness even more, by ex chang ing his d4 pawn, in or der to open the d-file and gain an important out post on the cen tral d5-square. An idea which was beau ti fully exe cuted by former World Cham pion Mikhail Botvinnik 70 years ago (!) and still highly top i cal. Struc ture 1.10 (Game 17 - Topalov-Aronian) deals with an idea sim i lar to the one demon strated in Struc ture 1.9, with the dif fer ence that Black's e-pawn and White's f-pawn have dis ap peared here and White has to rely more on his bishop pair. Struc ture 1.11 (Game 18 - Kaidanov-Onischuk) shows a beau ti ful po si tional ex change sac ri fice idea in the Sämisch Vari ation of the Nimzo-In dian. Struc ture 1.12 (Game 19 - Kasparov-Ivanchuk) deals with po si tions aris ing from the English Open ing where White has dou bled c-pawns. Mostly White also takes cen- tral con trol, but his d-pawn has not yet been pushed to d4 (which brings some clear advan tages here). Further - more, White's f-pawn has been ex changed for Black's e-pawn, so that the f-file is open for White's rook. Chap ter 1: Dou bled Pawns

Typ i cally in such po si tions, White has to use his ex tra space and his advan tage in devel op ment to work out an initia- tive, be fore his struc tural de fi cien cies will start to be felt.

18.Àxe6! and White is better. In such
po si tions, most of the time the crit i cal mo ment arrives rather early in the game. White has to sense this and seize the ini tia tive, and should not be afraid to sac ri fice ma te rial and take risks. If White misses such op por tu ni ties and con tin ues play ing 'reg u lar moves', like I did in this game, then he will of ten get out played positionally, lose the game with out firing a shot and won der through out a sleep less night how he ended up with such a lousy po si ti o n af - ter making all those 'normal' moves. In the game I defi nitely saw the pos si - bili ties as so ci ated with 13.f4!, but play - ing White against some un der-2500 Aus tra lian guy, I thought 'reg u lar' moves should suf fice, and the win should arrive with out any risks in - volved.

Black's counter - play is not im me di ately ob vi ous (con- trary to the Sämisch Nimzo, here White's po ten tially weak c4 pawn can- not eas ily be at tacked), so he has to play con struc tive moves, ex ert ing cen - tral pres sure and wait ing for White to make a de ci sion about his pawn cen tre. Once White pushes his pawns and the cen tral struc ture be comes fixed, Black should be able to shuf fle his pieces and find targets in the white camp.

White sac ri fices his cen tral pawn. It is, however, very risky for Black to ac cept it, since in this open po si tion, White's lead in devel op ment and strong bishop pair are worth con sid er ably more than the small material invest ment. The fol- low ing game is a good example:

Tak ing an im me di ate de ci sion in the cen tre with 10.d5 Àe7 11.Qc2, with the idea of f4, looks at trac tive at first sight, but Black has a strong an ti dote in

will take White a long time to ac ti vate his dark-squared bishop - if he ever succeeds.
10. ... b7-b6
Black can also in crease the cen tral pres - sure with 10...Õe8 and force White to take an imme di ate de ci sion. This looks like a good plan, but it costs two tempi, be cause in most cases the rook has to re turn to f8 later on. The fol low ing game is a good ex am ple of the way the play may then develop:
10...Õe8 11.d5 Àe7 12.e4 b6 13.Õb2.
(in prin ci ple this is a good, multi- functional move, pre paring a rook trans fer to the kingside and al low ing a bishop re treat to b1. It was, however, probably better to start with Õe1, when White has the knight trans fer Àf1-e3- f5 at hand) 13...Àg6 14.Õe1 Õf8
15.Àf1 Ãg4? (with the white rook on
b2 ready for a kingside trans fer, this 'weak ness prov o ca tion' plays into White's hands; 15...h6 was a better move) 16.f3 Ãd7 17.g3 h6 18.Õf2 Õb8 19.Àe3 a6 20.Àf5 Ãxf5 21.exf5 Àe7 22.g4 and White firmly took the ini tia tive on the kingside and went on to win in Bareev-Short, Geneva 1996.

Nimzo-Hübner Varia tion - fixed pawn cen tre In Nimzo-In dian po si tions with dou bled pawns and a full cen tre, it is ex tremely im - por tant for White not to push his cen tral pawns too quickly, which would block the po si ti o n and take out the dynamic ele ment. This is the kind of mis take that is easy to make and a lot of a world-class play ers have suffered pain ful losses as a result.

Very of ten when it turns out that there is not enough com pen sa tion for the sacrificed c4 pawn (this is mostly the pawn that falls), White is left with a ru ined po si - tion and loses with out a real fight. Since giv ing a pawn for dy nam ics based on a strong pawn cen tre is by defi ni tion an in tu itive sac ri fice, this is a tricky busi ness and even the very best of ten get lost in the treach er ous waters.

Clas si cal Nimzo full cen tre-dou bled pawns struc ture - White sac ri fices his c3 pawn A long time ago, in Oviedo 1992, I was play ing Black in a typi cal Nimzo-In dian with dou bled pawns and a closed cen tre against some 2450 player. At some stage there was a tac ti cal swindle and I won his c3 pawn. To my sur prise, my op po nent ob tained nice play, get ting am ple com pen sa tion for the pawn, and I was lucky to get away with a draw. The fact that his c3 pawn was not vol un tarily sac ri ficed but ob vi ously blun - Win ning Chess Middlegames dered, played a role, so I found it diffi cult to un der stand that be ing a sound pawn up I had had to fight to hold a draw. Later I analysed the game with Ljubojevic (for the youn ger gen er a tion: in the pe - riod of 1978-1988, Ljubomir Ljubojevic was one of the world's lead ing play ers), who opined that taking the c3 pawn was a se ri ous strate gic mis take, be cause ac cord ing to him I had helped my op po nent by giv ing him more space to move his pieces around and by ope ning the di ago nal for his dark-squared bishop. 'Any way, you are not the first one to take pawns in such po si tions and later re al ize that White gets a strong, last ing ini tia tive that's very diffi cult to cope with. Even a player of Spassky's stat ure once suf fered a ter ri ble de feat against Keres in their match, mis judg ing those risks. The pawn on c4 is al ways worth taking, be cause you threaten to ex change the light-squared bish ops and at the same time the a1-h8 di ago- nal re mains closed for the dark-squared one. Tak ing the pawn on c3 only opens the di- ag o nal and helps White', Ljubo was quick to explain. In 1992 I did not have a com puter, so the above-men tioned game was not easy to find. This ex pla na tion, how ever, seemed logi cal and I re mem bered it. Around the end of 1993 I bought my first lap top and af ter in stall ing the da ta base, one day Ljubo's com ments re sur faced in my mem ory. So, I found the game he had men tioned. Well, he was very right. Take a look for yourself.

It's a dif fi cult de ci sion, and it's im pos - si ble to cal cu late over the board. Black eventually goes for op tion A.

This vari a tion owes a con sid er able deal of its pop u larity to the ef forts of Artur Yusupov. A num ber of times Artur tried this vari ation as White, also against 12th World Champion Anatoly Karpov. Karpov scored well in those encounters. This vari ation came as a slight surprise to me, so I was try ing to re mem ber those Yusupov-Karpov games. I did re- mem ber that in one of the games there was a pawn ex change in the cen tre with
13...cxd4 14.cxd4 d5, and Black ob -
tained an equal game (Yusupov-Kar pov, Linares 1993), while in the other game be tween the same op po nents, a dif fer- ent plan was tried: the c4 pawn was im - me di ately at tacked - a plan which ap- pealed to me more at the time.

It is im portant for White to keep his cen tre flex i ble and push f4 at a favour - able mo ment. White also pre pares
12.Ãe3. As usual in such po
si tions, White has no rea son to worry about Black tak ing on d4, as al ready ex plained in the notes to Vyzhmanavin-Beliavsky. The imme di ate 11.f4? would have been a mistake, since af ter 11...exd4 12.cxd4 cxd4 Black would trans fer his f6 knight Chap ter 1: Dou bled Pawns ei ther via g4 to e3 or via d7 to c5, mak - ing use of the weak ness just cre ated in the white camp.
11. ... Àf6-d7?!

The fol lowing game is a good ex am ple of a stra te gic and tac ti cal bat tle in po si tions with doubled pawns and a full centre. Anand does every thing con trary to the gen eral set of strate gic rules I have been try ing to explain and to the exam ples I have given so far. Black opts for the in fe - rior open ing varia tion, then vol un tarily strands his knight on a5 with out hav ing any re al is tic chances to ever take on c4. White, mean while, gets his flexi ble pawn cen tre ready to roll and has well-devel oped pieces to sup port it, with out hav ing to make any con ces - sions from his side. At first sight it looks as if, with all those trumps, White should be hav ing a size - able advan tage (as in deed he had). Black then co mes up with a rather in ge - nious strate gic plan, start ing with
12...g5, which is worth study ing and
re mem ber ing. However, the black plan involves a weaken ing of his king and with White's advan tage in space as well as de vel op ment, the po si tion should log i cally con tain a tac ti cal blow. The prob lem with such tac ti cal so lu tions is that they must be de tected and exe cuted at once. Be ing just one move late will al low the op po nent to co or di nate his pieces and the possi bil ity is lost forever. Even though this was a rapid game, it was well played, rather com plex and an ex cel lent learn ing ex am ple.

Black stops the white advance and ham - pers both the en emy bish ops' move - ments.

Chap ter 1: Dou bled Pawns is to keep the white pawn struc ture in - tact with 10.d3. In that case, however, White will remain slightly be hind in de - vel op ment and Black will open the po si - tion with 10...d5, with sharp play and mutual chances, for ex am ple: 11.Qb3 Àa5 12.Qa3 c6 13.cxd5 cxd5 14.f4 Àc6 15.Õb1 Qc7 (15...Ãg4!? de serves atten tion) 16.Ãb2 Ãg4 17.c4!?

I as sume that Kasparov had ana lysed deeply and come to the con clu sion that the creation of a slightly strange pawn struc ture (af ter 10.dxe3) would ac tually be quite favour able for White. As we will see, Black will in deed find it dif fi cult to fight against the advance of the white pawn: 10...Qe7 11.Àh3 Qc5 and Black gets his pawn back, but he can not find counterplay against the advance of the white pawn: 12.Àf4 Qxc4 13.e4 d6 (White gets good compen sation for the pawn in case of 13...Qxc3 14.Õb1 d6

Black has a tem po rary advan tage in de - vel op ment and de cides, probably cor - rectly, to open up the po si tion. It would be a mistake for Black to stick to a 'reg- u lar' strat egy, keep ing White's dou bled pawn on c4 and, in gen eral, try ing to play closed-type po si tions. White has the open f-file, his pawns in the cen tre (c3, c4, d2, e2) en sure cen tral dom i na - tion and prevent Black from get ting any counterplay, while the dou bled c-pawns are actually quite useful here. Even a player of Anatoly Karpov's stat- ure - and in his prime - misjudged the domi na tion White achieves, as so ci ated pri marily with his cen tral pawn struc - ture, and he lost an important game with out get ting the slight est chance of counterplay.

In the com ments to the games, the club player will not only be ex plained the main stra te gic ideas, but he will also re ceive a lot of in forma tion about the openings played. If the reader takes enough time to study this chap ter, he should be well-armed to meet a num ber of vari ations in prac ti cal tourna ment play. A) Play ing against an iso lated pawn Struc ture 2.1 (Game 20 - Ivanchuk-Aronian). Here a clas si cal iso lated pawn-po si tion is reached, where the side fight ing against the iso lated pawn has a good block - ade while the side with the iso lated pawn has seemingly enough counterplay to make a draw. With mas ter ful play, Ivanchuk first quashes Aronian's counterplay and then ex ploits the weak ness of the iso lated pawn. Struc ture 2.2 (Game 21 - Kramnik-Illescas Cor doba). In one of the main vari ations of the Tarrasch De fence, fight - ing against an iso lated pawn, Kramnik em ploys a well-known strategy of cre at ing a sec ond weak ness to tar - get. When the knights are ex changed on c6, Black re cap - tures with his b7 pawn and now, in stead of an iso lated pawn on d5, the newly-created weak ness on c6 is the ob - ject of White's at ten tion. In our main game (Kramnik-

Illescas Cor doba) and other games featured in the com - ments (Kasparov-Illescas Cor doba, Sokolov- Petrosian and Ljubojevic-Gligoric), this classi cal strat egy is ex - plained. Struc ture 2.3 (Game 22 - Jaracz-P.H.Niel sen). In this game an other strat egy is em ployed. Fight ing against an iso lated pawn, White at some stage ex changes a black knight on e4 and af ter Black re cap tures with ...d5xe4 a rel ative pawn sym me try is reached, where White's pieces are better placed for the en su ing ac tions. B) Play ing with an iso lated pawn Struc ture 2.4 (Game 23 - Petrosian-Spassky). In this beau - tiful classic World Championship encounter, Spassky, play - ing with an iso lated pawn, at some stage ex changes knights on d4, and af ter Petrosian re cap tures e3xd4, a pawn sym - me try in the cen tre (white d4/black d5) is reached, which drastically changes the strategic obj ectives. In general, given the fact that both sides have a light-squared bishop remain - ing (the dark-squared ones have been ex changed), such a trans ac tion should in gen eral favour White. However, with the beau ti ful knight ma noeuvre 32...Àh7!, Spassky bril - liantly ex poses the de fi cien cies of the white po si tion and wins the game in style. Struc ture 2.5 (Game 24 - Sokolov-Cebalo). In my own game I em ployed a sim i lar strat egy; at some stage ex - chang ing knights on d5, and af ter the forced re cap ture ...e6xd5, a pawn sym me try in the cen tre (white d4/black d5) is reached, where the su pe ri ority of White's light-squared bishop to his black col league (the dark-squared ones be ing exchanged), com bined with White's con trol of the e5-square, along with the kingside at tack that is devel oped, plays a cru cial role.

Struc ture 2.6 (Game 25 - Kasparov-Karpov and Game 26 - Sokolov-Schandorff). Here, the same cen tral ex change trans ac tion oc curs as in the two previ ous games (Petrosian-Spassky and Sokolov-Cebalo), with the dif fer- ence that now White has a knight as a minor piece and Black a light-squared bishop. In gen eral, the knight is su - pe rior here. Most of the time, Black's light-squared bishop com bines badly with its own pawn on d5 - a light square -, and the dark-squared bishops are already ex changed. Struc ture 2.7 (Game 27 - Beliavsky-Illescas Cor doba) shows a beau ti ful, orig i nal rook ma noeu vre, ex e cuted by Illescas Cor doba play ing with an iso lated pawn. Struc ture 2.8 (Game 28 - Vyzhmanavin-Beliavsky and Game 29 - Sokolov-Nikolic): White, play ing with an iso - lated pawn, exe cutes a d4-d5 pawn break, af ter which a few pieces are ex changed. When a pawn sym me try is left on the board (two vs two on the queenside, three vs three on the kingside), White will have a dom i nantly-placed piece on the d5-square, caus ing trouble for Black. Game 30 (Kramnik-Hübner) shows a slightly un ortho- dox and un com mon idea: White sac ri fices his cen tral (iso lated) pawn in or der to elim i nate Black's bishop pair and gain a few tempi to develop an initia tive. Struc ture 2.9 (Game 31 - Kasparov-Timman). Here and in the fol low ing games we ana lyse an im portant stra te gic idea for White, where he sacri fices his iso lated pawn un- der dif fer ent cir cum stances (mostly by play ing d4-d5), ei ther to dis orga nize Black's pieces or to take advan tage (should Black re cap ture with a pawn) of a beau ti ful newly-created out post for the knight on d4, as well as the open e-file for the white rook on e1, which cre ates vari - ous sac ri fi cial mo tifs around tak ing the black bishop on e7 with the rook. In our first game (Kasparov-Timman), the purpose is to take advan tage of the dis orga ni zation of Black's pieces caused by the sac ri fice. Chap ter 2: Iso lated Pawns

White decides to re main fo cused on the d5 weak ness. The other way was to take on c6 in or der to create and fo cus on a new weak ness for Black. This used to be the main plan here - and it looks rather log i cal to me as well. Some ex am ples:

The dark-squared bish ops have been ex - changed, the knight on c5 is a strong, dom i nant piece and the black pawn on c6 is a newly-created weak ness. Black has to create counterplay in or der to achieve a dy namic balance. However, with out the dark-squared bish ops and with the white knight so well placed on c5, counterplay is not easy to find.

I have to ad mit that in my prepa ra tion for this game, for my de ci sion which vari ation to choose Kasparov's game played a cru cial role. This decision- making pro cess is in no way con nected to the pawn struc ture theme, but may be use ful for read ers to know. In the past ten years or so, my main weapon against the Tarrasch had been the main line (like in the game): 9.Ãg5 cxd4 10.Àxd4 h6 11.Ãf4 (in stead of
11.Ãe3), lead ing to a slightly better
end game for White. A few months be - fore my game against Petrosian, I had a game against Akobian. In the slightly better end game that re sulted af ter
11.Ãf4, I never had any real win ning
chances and the game ended in a dull draw. Now, fac ing Petrosian, I knew the Tarrasch would ap pear on the board. I had only about two hours to pre pare and wanted to play something new. Un der those cir cum stances it is use ful to check the games of the world's very best. Should the line cho sen by them suit you and not seem too com pli cated to pre pare in a few hours, PLAY IT. In my profes sional ca reer this strategy has served me very well.

14. Àa4-c5 Àc6-a5
Not an easy choice. This knight looks clumsy at the edge of the board, but other moves also do not create the kind of play Black is hop ing for.

It is im portant to note that tran si tions from an iso lated pawn to two weak hang ing pawns are a very com mon way to com bat the iso lated pawn. Con trary to par al lel hanging pawns in the cen tre, such weak con nected pawns are by def - i ni tion not mo bile, so there are no tac- tics that can be based on their mobility.

Black has ended up with a damaged pawn struc ture on the kingside, but there are not that many pieces left on the board and there is mate rial equality, so at first sight it seems that Black should have reason able drawing chances. If he man aged to ex change ei - ther queens or rooks, even los ing his a-pawn in the pro cess, he would reach the safety of a draw. It is rather pos si ble that Illescas Cor doba aimed for this po si ti o n when play ing
24...Õb8, be liev ing - with good rea

White's idea is to first ex ert pres sure on the d5 pawn, and later play Ãc5 and ex - change the dark-squared bish ops. A) 12.Qa4 is an other logi cal con tin - u ation, which was played in the 12th game of the match: 12...Àa5! (12...Qd7? looks like a stan dard move here, but it loses a pawn af ter 13.Ãxd5!

17.Qh2 Õc4!) 15...Qd7 16.f3 Ãh5,
since now the idea to ex change queens with 17.Qf5 fails to 17...Qe8! and Black was better in Gen. Timoschenko- Sturua, Pavlodar 1982; B) 12.h3 is an other stan dard move, played by Spassky himself. Black kept dy namic piece play af ter 12...Ãe6
13.Õc1 (it is good to note that per defi -
ni tion Black is never worried about
13.Àxe6 fxe6, since the loss of the
bishop pair is fully com pen sated for by the im prove ment of his pawn struc - ture) 13...Qd7 14.Qh2 Àe5! (other moves would al low White, like in Kramnik-Illescas Cor doba (Game 21), to create a new pawn weak ness in Black's camp: 15.Àxc6 bxc6 16.Àa4)

In the sec ond game of the match, Petro- sian had opted for a different plan and played 14.Àb5, with the idea to trans fer the knight to d4 and then to take on c6, creating a new pawn weak ness to focus on. This well-known strategy, which worked well in Kramnik- Illescas Cor - doba (Game 21), did not work here, since Black quickly achieved dy namic play and took over the initiative, never al lowing White to 'remind' him of his weak c6 pawn: 14...Qd7 15.À5d4 Ãh3

18. Qd1-e2
18.h3!, to prevent Black's ac tive play,
was better, se curing White a small ad - van tage.
18. ... Ãe6-g4!
A good move, forc ing White to choose be tween two un pleas ant op tions: ei ther to weaken his own pawn struc ture and close off the g2 bishop with f2-f3, or to move the queen to f1. The cen tral pawn break 18...d4, of ten an equal izer in these po si tions, does not work that well here: 19.Àxd4 Àxd4
20.exd4 Õxd4 21.Àb5 Õxc1 22.Àxd4!
Õxe1+ 23.Qxe1 and White is better.
19. f2-f3
White will con trol the e4-square and later place his bishop on h3, but this de - ci sion compromises his pawn struc ture, even though, due to the fact that the dark-squared bishops are exchanged, it is considerably more difficult for Black to make use of this po ten tial weak ness.
19.Qf1 was a safer de ci sion.
19. ... Ãg4-f5
20. Õc1-d1 Àc6-e5
White's pawn struc ture has been com - promised (he has a po ten tial weak ness on e3 to worry about), his bishop on g2 is temporarily shut off and can not exert pres sure on the d5 pawn. His small ad- van tage has vanished and he has to be careful to maintain the bal ance. Black, on the other hand, has easy piece play and the po ten tial weak ness of the isolani on d5 does not play any role now.

23. ... Õc4-b4

28. ... Àc6xd4
29. e3xd4 Õb6-e6
The sit uation in the centre has changed and an iso lated pawn-struc ture has been trans formed into a sym met ri cal one. Given the fact that the dark- squared bishops are exchanged, a symmetrical pawn struc ture d4/d5 with only the light-squared bish ops present, should, in prin ci ple, fa vour White. How ever, here Black has con trol over the e-file, he has a better-placed bishop and the white kingside can be come vul ner a ble.

This vari ation I played a lot al most twenty years ago. In the re sult ing iso - lated pawn-structures, White's kingside knight is placed on e2 rather than, more clas si cally, on f3.

Black is ob vi ously get ting nervous about the d4-d5 break and is tak ing rad i cal mea sures to prevent it. Af ter the text, however, the pawn struc ture in the cen tre is go ing to trans form from an iso lated pawn cen tre to a sym met ri cal one where White, due to his more ac - tive bishop, his e-file con trol and his at- tack ing pos si bili ties on the kingside, will have a clear advantage. It is very important that the dark- squared bish ops are exchanged, so that White can later build on the e5-square dom i nation (soon to be seen!). It was nec es sary for Black to keep ac tive coun - terplay with 16...Àa5! with 17...Àc4 to fol low, which was likely to have been Cebalo's plan when he re peated the line against Tisdall six years later.

Al ternatively, Black may start with
13...Ãb4 in or der to take on c3, creat-
ing a new po ten tial pawn weak ness in the white camp while keep ing full con - trol of the d5-square. This could well be the safest and best plan here, for in - stance: A) The at tempt to make use of the fact that the b5-square is not pro tected and to de velop an im me di ate ini tia tive with
14.Àb5 does not seem to bring White
any thing spe cial: 14...Àe4 15.a3 Àxg3
16.hxg3 Ãe7 17.Õfd1 Àf6 with ap-
prox i mate equal ity in Ftacnik- Beliavsky, Vienna 1986; B) 14.Õac1 is an swered by 14...Ãxc3
15.bxc3 Àe4 16.Ãf4 Õc8 17.Àd2
Àdf6. The black pawn is well placed on a7 and the po si ti o n was about equal in Arencibia-Beliavsky, Elista Olympiad 1998. It is in deed better for Black not to in - clude 13...a6 14.a4 here, since this in - clu sion of ten forces him to keep his rook on a8 to defend the a6 pawn.
13...Àh5 is an other op tion, elimi nat-
ing White's dark-squared bishop but al low ing the d5 break: 14.d5 Àxg3
15.hxg3 exd5 16.Àxd5! (the old
school probably thought that White should elim i nate Black's bishop pair, so in Gligoric-Petrosian, Zurich 1961, Chap ter 2: Iso lated Pawns White decided to ex change the light- squared bish ops with 16.Ãxd5 Ãxd5
17.Àxd5. However, with out the ac tive
bishop on c4 White was not able to de - velop any mean ing ful ini tia tive and Black was OK af ter 17...Õe8 18.Õfd1 Ãc5 19.Qc4 Õc8) 16...Ãd6 17.Õfd1 Àf6 18.Àe3 with an initia tive for White.
14. a2-a4 Ãe7-b4
Black may also decide to elim i nate White's dark-squared bishop im me di - ately with 14...Àh5. Just like in the game, that plan has the drawback that Black loses con trol of the d5-square, so it allows the typ i cal break 15.d5, for ex am ple: 15...Àxg3 16.hxg3 exd5
17.Àxd5! (it is a good idea for White
to keep the light-squared bish ops on the board here, since that makes it eas - ier for him to develop the initiative. White has only a small plus af ter
17.Ãxd5 Ãxd5 18.Àxd5 - it should
be noted that should Black choose for this plan, then he is better off to im - ple ment it with his pawn on a7, as in the game Gligoric-Petrosian)
17...Ãd6 18.Õfd1.
Here it also ap pears rather dif fi cult for Black to neu tral ize White's initia tive. In the game Sasikiran-Barsov, Doha 2003, White fol lowed a plan sim i lar to Vyzhmanavin's, and was suc cess ful af - ter 18...Àf6 19.Àe3! Qe7 20.Àh4 Õfd8 21.Àhf5 Qf8 22.Àg4!

A cau tious move that makes sure that the c5-square re mains pro tected. Dur - ing the game I con sid ered 11...b5 to be more log i cal, try ing to create counterplay on the queenside as quickly as pos si ble. However, the weak - ness of the c5-square can play a role here, for in stance: 12.Qd3 Ãb7

book (see Sokolov-Cebalo, Game 24), due to Black's pas sive b7 bishop and White's con trol of the e5-square, which he can oc cupy with his knight or with a rook, White has a long-term advantage here.
16. Ãb3-a2 Àc6-a5
Black wants to put his knight on c4 and shut off the white bishop. The other pos si bil ity was 16...b4, in which case, as previ ously seen in the com ment re- lated to 11...b5, White would be slightly better due to the weak ness of the c5-square after 17.Àa4 bxa3

A num ber of pieces have been ex - changed and White cannot re al is ti cally count on a kingside at tack any more, so the time has come for the the matic d4-d5 break, when a sym met ri cal pawn struc ture is reached in which White has a dom i nant piece in the cen tre - in this case, a knight - and Black, as is of ten seen in such po si tions, will find it dif fi - cult to neu tral ize the white initiative.

It is quite possi ble that Nikolic missed or un der es ti mated my next move. How - ever, the po si ti o n is ex tremely dif fi cult to defend. Per haps Black's biggest prob - lem is that he has no counterplay at all. The most stubborn de fence was

Most likely it was better for Black to stop the advance of the white h-pawn and elimi nate some tac tics with
16...h6!. Also (very important!), the
pawn on h5 would now be a new weak - ness and some thing for White to worry about. It is not easy for White to prove ad e quate com pen sa tion here and this may be the rea son why Kramnik never re peated this pawn sacrifice. For in stance: 17.Õad1 Qc5 18.Qg3 Àxh5 19.Qd3 Àf6! (19...Qf5

Sac ri fic ing an iso lated pawn by means of the the matic d4-d5 break One of the im por tant stra te gic plans for the side play ing with an iso lated pawn is to temporarily sacrifice it (mostly by pushing d4-d5, or d5-d4 for Black) and obtain ex cel lent piece play in re turn. If this strat egy is exe cuted well, then the ini tia tive de vel oped is worth much more than the small ma terial in vest ment. The break ing sacrifice of the isolated pawn is one of the very important typical motifs in this type of po si tion. In the next cou ple of games I will try to give a num ber of in struc tive ex - am ples. In the next Kasparov game, White al ways had the possi bil ity to quickly re gain his pawn with the better game, so even though it never amounted to a real sac ri fice, the way Kasparov kept his ini tia tive leav ing his pawn hang ing on d5 for a very long time and never allow ing Timman to take it in a con ve nient way, was true 'power play'. Later we will also delve into some ex am ples of the 'true' pawn sac ri fice.

Black re leases the pres sure in the cen tre, im me di ately en ter ing an iso lated pawn- po si tion. This plan has the draw back - which is excel lently ex ploited by Kasparov - that the usual block ade on d5 is not main tained, which means that White has tac ti cal pos si bil i ties re lated to the d4-d5 push. Af ter this game,
10...dxc4 has hardly been played any -

In the iso lated pawn-po si tion that is about to arise, Black usu ally prefers White to have his f1 rook devel oped to d1 rather than e1.

This is one of the main po si tions of the Queen's Gam bit Ac cepted with 7.a4. Com pared to the many other reg u lar iso lated pawn-po si tions, White has a pawn on a4 here (in most other cases this pawn is on a3), which has its pros and cons. With the pawn on a4, the white bishop on c4 is rather stable and it will also take Black more time to put his c8 bishop on the a8-h1 di ag o nal, since ...b7-b5 is never pos si ble. On the other hand, now the b4-square is, and will re main, chroni cally weak and is a nice place for a black knight. T_Ld.tM_ _J_.lJjJ

White's light-squared bishop heavily dom i nates its black coun ter part here and this plays a cru cial role. This typ i cal po si tion, with the d4/d5 pawn sym me try, the white bishop on b3 or d3, and the black bishop on e6 or b7, oc curs very of ten.

._.i._._ _.n.iN_. Ii._BiIi r._Qk._R One may won der why White first 'loses' a tempo with 6.Ãh4 and then takes with 9.Ãxf6. Well, White wanted to wait for Black to place his bishop on b7, then take on f6 and cap ture with the pawn on d5, forc ing the ...exd5 re cap - ture and ob tain ing a pawn struc ture where his light-squared bishop should be better placed than its black coun ter - part. This po si ti o n re sem bles those with the d4/d5 pawn sym me try in the cen tre where (as we have al ready es tablished) White's light-squared bishop is al most per defi ni tion better placed than its black colleague. Here, however, there is a rather impor - tant dif fer ence, since White has a mo - bile pawn on e3 and Black has one on c7. Most of the time it is advan tageous for White if Black de cides to push ...c7-c5 and then cap tures ...cxd4, al - low ing White to re cap ture e3xd4 and ob tain the advan ta geous cen tral sym - me try with a better bishop. The problem for White, however, is that af ter play ing ...c7-c5, Black usu ally keeps the ten sion in the cen tre, rel y ing on his bishop pair (the bishop on f6 be - ing well placed). Should White try to take advan tage of Black's hang ing pawns and at some stage take d4xc5, then Black gets the op portu nity (as we will see later in a num ber of ex am ples in Chap ter 3 on hang ing pawns) to play the dy namic ...d5-d4 pawn thrust, of - ten devel op ing a serious initiative. This is one of the main po si tions in the Tartakower/Makogonov, which is also im por tant for a stra te gic un der stand ing of pawn struc tures in the middlegame in gen eral. So I shall give a num ber of lines that are not of di rect in ter est for this game, but serve to create a better un der stand ing of the pros and cons of the position.

A nice fi nal touch. White resigned. Win ning Chess Middlegames Chapter 3 Parallel Hanging Pawns in the Centre In tro duc tion In this chap ter I have kept the con cept simi lar to the chap ters on dou bled pawns and iso lated pawns, se lect ing diagrams that show pawn struc tures (and games) re lated to the most prin ci pled plans for both sides: with par al lel hanging pawns and fight ing against them. Hang ing pawns in the cen tre are by defi ni tion con nected; for two hang ing pawns on the same rank we will use the term 'par al lel' in this book. They normally arise from vari ous 1.d4 ope nings, like the Tarrasch De fence, the Tartakower Vari ation of the Queen's Gam bit De clined, the Queen's In dian De fence, the Meran Vari ation, etc. In four of our five com mented games, the Tartakower Vari ation of the Queen's Gam - bit is played. For a club player will ing to learn the stra te gic pros and cons of these po - si tions and, sub se quently, to ei ther em ploy this vari ation with black or to learn better how to tackle it with white in prac ti cal tourna ment games, it will certainly pay off to spend time on a thor ough analysis of these games and comments. Struc ture 3.1 & Struc ture 3.2 (Game 36 - Fischer-Spassky). This World Cham pi on ship classic re- mains an ex cel lent learn ing exam ple. Af ter the open ing, one of the most typi cal po si tions with hang ing pawns in the cen tre arises. Fischer then exe cutes a stan dard plan, exe cuted by White on a num ber of other oc ca sions in dif - fer ent open ings - one of the main lines of the Tarrasch De fence in partic u lar: first he takes the black bishop on e6 with Àd4xe6, forc ing ...f7xe6, and then he attacks the black cen tre with a timely e3-e4 pawn thrust, forc ing Black to make a po si tional con ces sion. Spassky quickly col lapses un der the pres sure. The com ments to this game also provide a good open ing guide line for a club player in this Tartakower Vari ation of the Queen's Gam bit. In Game 37 (Sokolov-Khalifman) we see White build ing up pres sure against Black's hang ing pawns in the cen tre, to the point where Black is forced to look for tac ti cal so lu - tions.

An in ter est ing stra te gic bat tle en sues, show ing how eas ily things can go wrong in such com pli cated po si tions. This game and its com ments are a good learn ing exam ple of this Tartakower line, as well as of the stra te gic pros and cons of the po si ti o n. Game 39 (Kramnik-Yusupov) is an in ter est ing tussle, where both sides demon strate an abun dance of tac ti cal pos si bil i ties such as are of ten pres ent in these dy namic po si tions. Again, be sides im prov ing his un der stand ing of these po si tions in gen eral, the club player will find some use ful ope ning informa tion about this Tartakower line.

As of ten happens af ter a pawn swap on d5, Black keeps his bishop on the h3-c8 di ag onal, since from b7 it would hit its own pawn on d5. This gen eral logic is ques tion able here, since af ter ...c7-c5 White is likely to take on c5 and then, if Black has two par al lel hanging pawns in the cen tre (c5 and d5), it is quite use ful to have the bishop placed on the long di - ag o nal, sup port ing var i ous tac tics re lated to the ...d5-d4 break. Any how, Black has dy namic play af ter 11...Ãb7 and White has not shown a way to an advan tage af - ter this con tinuation. It is fully playable and I will give a few ex am ples: A) With 12.Qa4 White fol lows a stan - dard plan, like in our main game; rel y - ing on the pin along the a3-f8 diag onal.

An in ex pli cable mis take for a player of Spassky's cal i bre. Did he re ally fear Fischer so much? White now gets a free hand to at tack on the kingside, and his bishop gets open di ag o nals, while Black does not have any counterplay and is doomed to wait in ag ony for the in ev i - table to happen. Black's po si tion is al ready diffi cult, but it could have been better de fended. One way is to try and provoke White to play e4-e5 with the black pawn on d5, so that Black can set up a pawn chain with e6, d5, c4, and try to restrict the white bishop: A) 20...Àf6 21.Qh3!

In a higher sense, Black is lost now.

Chap ter 3: Par al lel Hang ing Pawns in the Cen tre Po si tions with par al lel hang ing pawns in the cen tre are diffi cult to play for both sides, since there are lots of dy - namic pos si bili ties involved and a keen eye for de tail is needed. There are a num ber of well-known plans, but it has to be thor oughly checked whether they can be ap plied in the ex act sit uation on the board. Be ing a 1.d2-d4 player I have had plenty of such po si tions in my own games (mostly play ing against the hang ing pawns) and I have seen the pros and cons. The fol low ing two ex - am ples from my own prac tice show the sen si tiv ity of these po si tions and how easily things can go wrong.

_._J_._.
._Ii._._ _.n.iN_. IiQ_.iIi r.b.kB_R I guess that the main idea be hind the choice for this move (as op posed to
6...Ãd6) is to avoid a the o reti cal dis -
cus sion. In al most all lines, the bishop is better placed on d6, where, among other things, it sup ports the lib er at ing move ...e6-e5.
7. b2-b3
The most com mon move here, since Black does not have ...e6-e5. White can also opt for 7.Ãd3, but then Black has the op portu nity to try and prove that his bishop is well-placed on e7 by play - ing 7...c5, and af ter 8.O-O cxd4 9.exd4 dxc4 10.Ãxc4 O-O 11.Õd1 Àb6

7. ... b7-b6
In the ab sence of the ...e6-e5 break, Black has to develop his light-squared bishop to b7. We also have this type of line with the black bishop on d6 in - stead of e7, and again this looks (to me at least) like the more natu ral devel op - ment. You may have un der stood by now that I am not fond of the 6...Ãe7 line.

12. c4xd5 e6xd5
13. d4xc5 b6xc5
So we have reached one of the typ i cal po si tions with par al lel hang ing pawns in the cen tre. White is go ing to put pres sure on the c5 and d5 pawns (mostly d5), try ing to force Black to make a de ci sion in the cen tre - push ing ...c5-c4 or ...d5-d4 - while Black will try to co or di nate his pieces and look for dy namic pos si bil i ties re lated, mostly, to the ...d5-d4 pawn break. Cap turing 13...Õxc5? and opt ing for an iso lated pawn struc ture in stead of hang ing pawns in the cen tre would have been a grave po si tional mis take, since Black can not develop any ac tive piece play here to com pen sate for the iso lated pawn. Af ter such po si tional res - ig nation, things can go very wrong very quickly: 14.Qb1 Õe8 15.Àe2! Õc8
16.Àf4 h6? (a small move with big
con se quences) 17.Ãf5! Õc7 18.Àd4 Ãa6 19.Àde6 1-0 Polugaevsky-Co mas Fabrego, Palma de Mallorca GMA 1989.
14. Ãd3-f5!
Pin ning the d7 knight and in creas ing the pres sure on the d5 pawn (the c5 pawn is well de fended and can not be hit for the time being) is a stan dard plan here and it is the correct way to pro ceed. One of the stan dard stra te gic plans in these po si tions is 14.e4. The idea is to force ...d5-d4 (in case of a mas sive swap on e4, Black's c5 pawn would re- main rather weak and easy to target) and then trans fer the c3 knight via d2 to c4 and reach the con stel lation Ãd3/Àc4; or to leave that knight on d2, put the bishop on c4 and transfer the other knight via e1 to d3 with the con stel la tion Àd2/Àd3/Ãc4, tak ing advan tage of the block ade on d3 and c4 and, af ter that block ade is established, start advanc ing the e- and f-pawns (f2-f4 and e4-e5). The problem for White is that Black gets space and pos si bil i ties for a kingside at tack. Moreover, the idea out - lined above is dif fi cult to exe cute, for ex am ple: 14...d4 (Black also gets good counterplay in the event of 14...c4
15.bxc4 dxc4 16.Ãe2 Qc7) 15.Àb1
Àg4! (Black has to be quick and must not give White time to achieve Àa3-c4, h2-h3, Ãb2-c1) 16.Àbd2 Qc7!
17.Àc4 f5! and Black has taken the ini -
tia tive; his pieces co or di nate very well. It is clear that White's strat egy has failed. ._Td.tM_ jL_SlJjJ ._._.s._ _.jJ_B_. ._._._._ _In.iN_. IbQ_.iIi _._R_Rk. ._Td.tM_ jL_SlJjJ ._._.s._ _.jJ_B_. ._._._._ _In.iN_. IbQ_.iIi _._R_Rk.
14. ... g7-g6?
Not a bad move in it self, but in this case it does weaken the a1-h8 di ag o nal, which will be one of the main rea sons for Black's later problems. It was better to post pone this de ci sion. A logi cal op tion was to play a use ful move like 14...Õe8 and af ter 15.Àe2 Win ning Chess Middlegames Õc7! Black seems to be do ing OK, since af ter 16.Àf4 he can choose be tween
16...Ãd6 and 16...d4.
15. Ãf5-h3 a7-a6
Black would like to put his rook on c7 (in or der to un pin his d7 knight), but could not do this im me di ately due to

This is con sid ered to be the start ing po - si ti on of the vari ation. One may won der what White's idea could be here? Af ter all, Black has the bishop pair, the dark-squared bishop in partic u lar be ing well placed on f6, and with his last move ...c7-c5 Black even gets some pres sure on White's cen tral pawn d4. Well, White's main idea in this vari a - tion is to force a swap on d4 and end up play ing with a favour able d4/d5 pawn sym me try in the cen tre, where his light-squared bishop on d3 is su pe rior to its col league on b7, an idea we have al ready seen in a num ber of games in Chap ter 2 on the Iso lated Pawn. If White's idea is well exe cuted, he will have a small, last ing advantage.
12. ... Àb8-a6
With the text Black wants to avoid the afore men tioned ex change on d4 and keep the ten sion in the cen tre - which is a rea son able plan in gen eral. How - ever, the black knight is a bit clumsy on a6, and the text move is con sid ered to be one of the side lines. The po si tion is in ter est ing from a stra- te gic pro spec tive. It re quires both sides to be on the alert for cen tral ex changes, be cause three dif fer ent pawn struc tures may eas ily arise here: with an iso lated pawn, with cen tral pawn sym me try, or with hang ing pawns in the cen tre. For a better un der stand ing of the pros and cons of the po si ti o n I shall give a few lines. A) 12...Àd7 is con sid ered to be the main line. Quite some time ago, in Biel 1989, I had a game against Hellers which con tin ued 13.Ãf5, in creas ing the pres sure on Black's cen tral pawns and try ing to force Black to make a de- ci sion in the cen tre. 13.Ãb1 has also been tried, but this al lows Black to continue nor mal de vel op ment with
13...Õe8 and af ter 14.dxc5 Àxc5

15.Ãd3 Ãg7 16.Qb3 (White has
slight pres sure on d5, his d3 bishop is con sid er ably better placed than its black coun terpart, and White's f3 knight is likely to en ter on e5. Black, however, has a strong bishop on g7 and his pres- sure along the a1-h8 diag o nal can be an im portant source of counterplay)

This is one of the typ i cal po si tions with the hang ing pawns in the cen tre-struc - ture. With e3-e4, White has provoked ...d5-d4, which has given White strong con trol of the f1-a6 and a2-g8 di ag o - Chap ter 3: Par al lel Hang ing Pawns in the Cen tre nals and an ex cel lent block ade on d3 and c4 in many cases. Black's c5 pawn is also rather weak. The po si ti on is ob jec - tively better for White, but ex act play is needed. Black has the bishop pair (both of them are work ing now) and a po ten - tially strong passed d-pawn, so - as we are about to see - the tables can turn quickly. Please note that this pawn struc ture is far better for White than the simi lar one dis cussed in the previ ous game Soko- lov- Khalifman, where I sug gest 14.e4 in the com ments, in stead of the game move 14.Ãf5. Here White does not have the dark-squared bishop on b2; he has ex changed that bishop for Black's knight on f6, which is rather useful.

Black de cides to elim i nate White's dark-squared bishop. However, given the fact that the white knight on c3 ex - erts pres sure on Black's d5 pawn and White's g3 bishop is not caus ing any par ticu lar trouble at the mo ment, Black can keep the knight on e4 (keep ing the op tion of ex chang ing White's c3 knight at any mo ment) and main tain ten sion in the cen tre by play ing, for ex am ple,
13...Qc8, as in our next featured game.
Let me give a short survey of the op - tions in this position. A) 13...cxd4?! (the wrong plan. Black vol untarily rel eases the tension in the cen tre, giv ing White a free hand to take advantage of his well-placed pieces)
14.Ãxe4! (instead of play ing an iso lated
pawn-po si tion, White prefers a favour - able sym me try) 14...dxe4 15.Àxd4. White con trols the d-file, his knight is ex cel lently placed on d4, his bishop is work ing well on g3 and Black's b7 bishop is pas sive, hit ting its own pawn on e4. All in all, White is clearly better; B) 13...Àdf6 14.dxc5! (chang ing the pawn struc ture and creat ing an iso lated pawn on d5 for Black, while the white weak ness on c3 will hardly be felt)

If I am not mis taken, this in terest ing idea was invented by Short and in troduced into prac tice in this game. Black wants to put his d7 knight on f6 and be able to re- capture on c5 with his b6 pawn (which is why he moves his queen away from the d-file pin). Also, after ...Àdf6 the black queen can be transferred to e6, which is one of the best squares for the queen in these posi tions. T_D_.tM_ jL_SlJj. .j._._.j _.jJ_._. ._.iS_._ _.nBiNb.

White wants to exert pres sure on the d5 pawn and set up a bat tery on the b1-h7 di ag o nal, but both these mo tifs will not have any prac ti cal sig nif i cance in this game. White can not try for the up per hand/sym met ri cal po si ti o n with

signed in Sargissian-Halkias, Antalya Ech 2004. The way Sargissian suf fered this terri ble de feat in this game is not that uncom - mon for white players in such po si tions. Rather of ten, the side play ing against hang ing pawns in the cen tre, in stead of con cen trating on the e3-e4 pawn break or straight pressure on Black's c5 or d5 pawns (mostly c5) makes the mis take of be liev ing that a sense less shuf fling of pieces will for some rea son make one of Black's hang ing pawns weak by it self, and will force Black onto the de fen sive. In the mean time, Black will naturally use his space advan tage to ei ther prepare a suc cess ful ...d5-d4 break - as in our main game Lautier-Short - or - as in Halkias's case - a kingside attack.

And White re signed. Chap ter 3: Par al lel Hang ing Pawns in the Cen tre Chapter 4 Pawn Ma jority in the Centre In tro duc tion In this chap ter I have sys tem atized the struc tures and games slightly dif fer ently com - pared to the previ ous three chap ters, since the vari ous the matic ideas for both sides of ten must be con sid ered and fi nally cho sen, de pend ing on the pecu liari ties of the po si ti o n. Therefore, 7 structures are given on the fol low ing pages, re lated to the the matic ideas. Five com mented games then fol low, and of ten, in one game or its com ments, we en coun ter differ ent the matic ideas. The reader may find that I am per haps a lit tle bi ased, favouring the side play ing with the pawn ma jority. This opin ion could be correct, given the fact that I am a 1.d4 player, and through out my ca reer I have mostly played on the side with the pawn ma - jority in the centre. For a club player, apart from the fact that he will en hance his un der stand ing of the matic ideas, the five se lected games also offer an ex cel lent guide to the ope ning vari ations featured, and if you take time to study the ma te rial se ri ously, the knowl - edge you ac quire can be very valu able in tournament play. Game 41 (Spassky-Petrosian) is a guide to one of the main lines of the Semi-Tarrasch, fea tur ing clas sic and con tem po rary games. Game 44 (Sokolov-Howell) explains an in ter est ing side line of the Grünfeld In - dian and in cludes some previ ously un published analy sis of this game by the author. The games 42 (Kasparov-Najdorf), 43 (Galliamova-Tiviakov) and 45 (Sokolov- Polgar) all feature the Petrosian Vari ation of the Queen's In dian, a vari ation that the young Kasparov built a con sid er able part of his suc cess on al most 30 years ago. This partic u lar vari ation has also served me very well. In the com ments to these games I give the relevant stra te gic plans, im portant games, per sonal opinions and analyses. Struc ture 4.1 is a reg u lar start ing po si ti on with a pawn ma jority in the cen tre.

The pawn struc ture we have here is sim i lar to the one in the Petrosian Vari a - tion of the Queen's In dian, which we will see in the games Kasparov-Najdorf, Gallia mova-Tiviakov and Sokolov- Polgar further on in this chap ter. Com pared to that vari ation, Black has a slightly more con ve nient sit u a tion here, since he can im me di ately force the ex change of the dark-squared bish - ops. Given the fact that White has con- sid er ably more space, it is gen er ally quite use ful for Black to ex change his dark-squared bishop for its white coun terpart, in or der to make it eas ier for him self to ma noeuvre his pieces within the lim ited space avail able to him. The other op tion for Black is to slightly de lay the bish ops swap and make use of a tac ti cal el e ment to aim for quicker de - vel op ment, since af ter 8...Àc6 9.Ãc4 Black has the tempo move 9...b5. Prac - tice has shown that, with correct play by White, it is ques tion able whether Black, who is slightly un der devel oped, is ready for such an ac tive un dertak ing. The fol low ing game is a good example. T_LdMl.t j._._JjJ

Since this is one of the typ i cal po si tions with a pawn ma jority in the cen tre, this is a good mo ment to take stock and try to ex plain some gen eral plans. Black is, per defi ni tion, go ing to de - velop his bishop to b7, where it will be ac tively placed, hit ting the white cen tre. Black's a8 rook will be devel oped to c8, where normally White leaves it un op - posed, since rook ex changes are gen er - ally good for Black. The black knight is some times - as in this game - devel oped to c6 in or der to hit on White's d4 pawn and to have ma - noeuvres like ...Àc6-a5 or ...Àc6-e7; or to d7 in or der not to step into a d4-d5 tempo. Queen swaps and other types of ex - changes are gen er ally good for Black here. White is sup posed to orga nize his forces be hind a mighty pawn cen tre and ei ther exe cute the d4-d5 thrust in or der to get a passed pawn, or sac ri fice the d4 pawn in or der, af ter d4-d5 e6xd5, to push e4-e5, ob tain an out post on d4 for his f3 knight and get at tack - ing pros pects on the black king. If the black knight is devel oped to d7, White also has a pos si bil ity to leave his Chap ter 4: Pawn Ma jor ity in the Cen tre pawn on d4 and to push e4-e5 in order to limit this d7 knight and seize some ex tra space to orga nize an at tack on the kingside. The fact that White has sur - rendered the central d5-square is mostly less relevant than it may seem. White should gen er ally try to avoid ex - changes and keep as many pieces on the board as pos si ble. These are the gen eral plans in the po si - tions with a pawn ma jority in the cen - tre. They also ap ply, as we shall see, to the Petrosian Vari ation of the Queen's In dian, where both sides have dark- squared bish ops on the board. I shall give a suf fi cient num ber of top-class prac ti cal ex am ples to ex plore the above- men tioned plans. TsLd.tM_ jJ_._JjJ

Black can also first develop his bishop to b7, and later de cide where to put his knight, by opt ing for 11...b6?!. This move, however, has the draw back that it al lows the im me di ate 12.d5! (one of the rea sons be hind 11.Ãc4). White seizes a lot of space and has the better chances af ter 12...Ãa6! (the c4 bishop has to be ex changed) 13.Ãxa6 Àxa6
14.d6! Àc5 15.e5, as in Kortchnoi-

A) White has a rather in ter est ing plan in 14.Õe3!?. As far as I know, this move has been played only once at top level, but it probably de serves more at ten tion. White wants to exe cute the afore men - tioned e4-e5 plan, surren dering the d5-square and obtaining a kingside at- tack in re turn. Let's see how this worked out in practice:

sur pris ing that White de vel ops a strong kingside at tack here. Af ter all, the di ag o nal of the black bishop is now open, the d5-square is firmly un der black con trol - one might even argue that White is ef fec tively a pawn down -, any kind of end ing would be more or less win ning for Black, and White still does not have any threats for the mo ment. Black's problems, on the other hand, are that his b7 bishop in deed looks won der ful, but does not create any threats at the mo ment; his knight on d7 and later f8 is pas sive; it is dif fi cult to cre ate counterplay, Black's forces are cut off from the defence of the kingside, and therefore Black will be forced to play ...f7-f5 at some stage, which will make his e6 pawn weak af - ter exf6.

I_._QiIi _._Rr.k. anal y sis di a gram A nice diagram po si tion for a good un - der stand ing of the point be hind a stan - dard sac ri fice like 16.d5. White has given a pawn in or der to have an ex cel lent knight on d4, which can eas ily be come a very strong attack ing piece by jump ing to f5. White's d3 bishop is a strong attack ing piece, which may eas ily form a battery with the queen and is per fectly placed on the open di ag o nal. White's e5 pawn has attack ing power of its own (e5-e6) and can soon be joined by the f-pawn (f2-f4) rolling on the kingside. Black's pieces are doomed to pas siv ity: the b7 bishop is merely a pawn, the f5-square is weak due to the e6 pawn be ing moved to d5, his kingside pawn struc ture is vul ner able to at tack in gen - eral, the knight on c4 is do ing lit tle and does not sup port the kingside de fence, and fi nally, Black's counterplay is very limited as well. All this for the price of a sin gle pawn is a good foun dation for a po si tional pawn sac ri fice and in gen - eral, not too many di rect vari ations are needed to justify its soundness. I know that I am be ing a lit tle bi ased here - on the other hand, is n't life it self Win ning Chess Middlegames bi ased? - when I say that in such po si - tions I would al most per defi ni tion pre- fer White.

This vari ation was brought on the big scene by the 10th World Champion Tigran Petrosian, who reg u larly em - ployed it since 1958, and it was named af ter him. Nowa days it is one of the main lines of the Queen's In dian. Most of the time, the middlegame aris ing from this vari ation features a typ i cal struc ture with a pawn ma jority in the centre. The young Kasparov picked up this dy - namic line, stud ied its ins and outs and scored many de ci sive vic tories with it, tak ing ad van tage of his ex cel lent feel ing for White's attack ing po ten tial, which is stored behind his cen tral pawn majority. The po si tional idea be hind 4.a3 is a rather simple, straightfor ward fight for the cen tral squares d5 and e4. Con - cretely, the move prevents the Ãb4 pin.

A good mo ment to take stock and com - pare this po si tion to the previ ous Semi- Tarrasch game. The pawn struc ture is the same, but the dif fer ence is that here the dark-squared bish ops are still on the board. In my opin ion, in gen eral this should be favour able for White, since: - Black has con sid er ably less space to ma noeuvre his pieces; - Black queen sorties (to f6) are not pos si ble; - In the event of a cen tral pawn block ade (after d4-d5 and e6-e5), it is, in gen eral, pos i tive for White to have the dark- squared bish ops on the board. Should a black pawn appear on h6, White may get sac ri fi cial motifs with Ãxh6 and, in gen - eral, in many lines White simply has one more piece for his kingside attack. The plus for Black - perhaps the only one - is the fact that the ...f7-f5 idea, to under - mine White's pawn cen tre and take con - trol of the d5-square, is much eas ier to exe cute with the dark-squared bish ops still present.

Here Kasparov opts for a the matic pawn sac ri fice, which we have al ready ex - plored in this chap ter. The problem Chap ter 4: Pawn Ma jor ity in the Cen tre with this sacrifice is that, even if it is sound from a po si tional/prin ci pled stand point, there are always spe cifics of the po si ti o n that are im por tant to de ter - mine the correct ness of the sac ri fice. Those spe cifics are also present here:
17. d4-d5! e6xd5!
Cor rectly ac cept ing the sac ri fice. De - clin ing with 17...e5 gives White an easy, risk-free advan tage af ter 18.Õab1 Ãa8 (oth er wise 19.Ãd2 co mes any - way) 19.Ãd2 Àb7 20.a4 Àc5 21.a5.

As al ready ex plained, one of the im por - tant as pects of this the matic pawn sac ri - fice is the beau ti ful out post on d4 for the white knight. Con quering the bishop pair with 19.Àg5 does not give White enough com pen sa tion af ter

An other important as pect of the d4-d5 pawn sac ri fice in these po si tions is the trans fer of the white knight via d4 to the ex cel lent at tack ing post on f5. Kasparov is play ing a clas si cal, book ex - am ple at tack. There are, however, spe - cifics of the po si ti on and Black has a de - fence which can turn the tables.
20. ... Ãe7-f6?!
It is obvi ous that the e7 bishop has to move. However, there was a tempo move: 20...Ãd6!. I as sume that Black did not like this move for the prin ci pled rea son that his bishop would re main un der at tack by the f5 knight. However, this small tempo gain gives Black a cru cial break and it is dif fi cult for White to prove that his ini tiative is in deed worth the sac ri ficed ma te rial. Interest ingly, 20...Ãd6! is not men tioned at all by Kasparov in his com ments (in Chess In for mant and some other publi ca - tions) and he praises the game move
20...Ãf6 as the best de fence, giv ing it an
ex cla mation mark. It seems to me that af- ter 20...Ãd6! Black is better:

Black re signed. In this rel atively short game, Black suc - cumbed un der the pres sure and his blun der abruptly ended the game. How ever, the middlegame po si ti o n, typ i cal for this struc ture, is a beau ti ful learn ing ex am ple, show ing a mul ti tude of dy namic pos si bili ties and stra te gic ideas for both sides.

Win ning Chess Middlegames The pawn struc ture is the same as in our pre vi ous game Kasparov-Najdorf, with the dif fer ence that Black's knight is now devel oped on d7 in stead of c6. The advan tage of this is that it can be trans- ferred to f6 or, in some lines (should ...e6-e5, d4-d5 ma te ri al ize), to c5, the c-file re mains open and the rook can some times en ter via c3. Moreover, White's d4-d5 break does not come with tempo. The dis advan tage is that White's d4 pawn is not attacked.

Tiviakov does not have the best ex pe ri - ences with Galliamova in this line. In their mini-match in Elista, in the previ - ous game where Galliamova played White, Tiviakov chose 12...Õc8 and let's see what hap pened:
13.Ãb2 (in this line White some times
also de cides to develop his bishop to the h2-b8 di ag o nal with 13.Ãf4. The move or der with 12...Qc7 ex cludes this pos si bil ity) 13...Qc7. ._T_.tM_ jLdSlJjJ .j._J_._ _.j._._. ._.iI_._ i.iB_N_. .b._QiIi r._._Rk. ._T_.tM_ jLdSlJjJ .j._J_._ _.j._._. ._.iI_._ i.iB_N_. .b._QiIi r._._Rk. anal y sis di a gram It is always diffi cult to de cide where to put the white rooks in such po si tions. Should it be f1/d1, or e1/d1, or d1/a1, or maybe d1/c1? Former World Cham - pion Anatoly Karpov, in his prime, had a fan tas tic natu ral feel ing for these de ci - sions. The course of the game would in - vari ably prove that his rooks had been put on the best squares from the very beginning. In this par tic u lar sit u a tion I be lieve that White's f1 rook should stay on f1 in or - der to sup port the pawn push f2-f4, while the only ques tion, in my opin ion, remains what is the best square for the other rook. However, you should take my opin ion with a grain of salt, since two con sid er ably better players than my - self be lieved that the f1 rook should be placed on d1! Let's see a few ex am ples:

(first clos ing the di ag o nals that lead towards the black king) 19.Ãc2 f5!. The white at- tack is stopped, while the b2 bishop has been re duced to a mere pawn.

B1) 15.Õfd1 is a strat egy that I do not agree with, although it has been em - ployed by no less players than Kasparov and Svidler. It looks to me that the rook is in deed per fectly placed on f1 and the correct way for White to pro ceed is
15.f4! with ini tia

Seiz ing the ini tia tive on the queenside.

White's main idea is to in - crease the pres sure on Black's cen tre by play ing f2-f4, hop ing that Black will have to take ...e5xf4, af ter which White will get strong mo bile pawns in the cen tre (d5, e4) and his bishop pair will start working again.

This has some pluses: White's d4 pawn is easier attacked and also the black king is better protected against dif ferent sorts of di rect attacks. The minus is that, should White be on time with the pawn push h2-h4-h5 - and most of the time he is - Black's kingside may quickly be - come vul ner a ble to at tack.

Win ning Chess Middlegames Through out my ca reer I have regu larly em ployed the Petrosian Vari ation with white as my main weapon against the Queen's In dian. In the be gin ning of the year 2002 I spent some ex tra ef fort study ing this line and the middlegame po si tions aris ing from it. Such ef forts usu ally pay off and in deed, in the 2002-2005 pe riod I scored well with this line and played a num ber of in ter- est ing games. In my com ments to this game I shall also give a few other interesting examples.

This is the other main move in the top i - cal Petrosian Vari ation. 7.e3 we have stud ied in Kasparov-Najdorf (Game 42) and in Galliamova-Tiviakov (Game 43). White's idea is simple - he wants to play e2-e4 in one move. However, later on the white queen mostly moves to e2 and normally we get either a trans po si - tion, or po si tions very simi lar to those af ter 7.e3. One of the rea sons that
7.Qc2 is more fre
quently played than
7.e3 nowa days, is that white players
have problems to find an advan tage in the line 7.e3 g6. 7.Qc2, however, gives Black an ex tra pos si bil ity in the line with 8...c5 - see Sokolov-Kramnik, the comments to 8...Ãe7. Ts.dMl.t jLj._JjJ .j._J_._

His king is still stuck on e8. White has pos si bil i - ties to open up the cen tre with d4-d5, play on the black king stuck in the mid - dle of the board, and an un pleas ant check or pin along the a4-d8 di ag o nal may come any moment. That said, so far white players have sur - pris ingly failed to find an advan tage in this cur rently pop u lar line. White can develop his dark-squared bishop to either e3 or b2.

13. ... Õf8-d8
Chap ter 4: Pawn Ma jor ity in the Cen tre Black first wants to place a rook on d8, hit ting d4, and then de cide where to develop his b8 knight. However, given the fact that the b8 knight will be devel - oped to d7 any how, it would make more sense to first develop the b8 knight and then see what to do with the f8 rook. Main the ory agrees with this, and the game con tinuation is con sid - ered to be a sideline. Most of the games con tinue with
13...Ãxd3 14.Õxd3 cxd4 15.cxd4 Àd7
and here the main the o reti cal discus - sion con cen trates on 16.e5, with which White em ploys a stan dard plan (seen in many of our exam ples) of surren dering the d5-square in or der to gain more space on the kingside. Here the ab sence of light-squared bish ops makes the de- fence easier for Black. Back in 2003, preparing for the Hoogeveen tourna ment, I anal ysed the stan dard at tack ing move 16.h4, which keeps all the op tions re gard ing the cen- tral pawns open. Since Polgar played
13...Õd8, I was not able to test this plan
(which would have been a novelty at the time) in Hoogeveen, but I got my chance a few months later in Reyk javik, against Stefansson:
16...Qa6 (plac ing the black queen on
the f1-a6 di ag onal and freeing the c8-square for a rook is the most log i - cal con tinuation here. On a6, the queen is better placed than on c4, since now Black of ten plans Õac8 fol - lowed by Õc3 or Õc4. Moreover, the queen be ing on c4 could cost Black a tempo af ter 16...Qc4 17.h5 h6

Here I was spend ing most of my time check ing whether my planned tac ti cal idea worked. And it does work in deed. The aes thetic ef fect of my 33rd move also played a role for me in that I did not look for other so lu tions. Even better was 32.Àe7!! Ãb2 33.Õe5!, win ning on the spot.
