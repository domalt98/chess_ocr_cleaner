As with all books by Jacob Aagaard, this is a quality work! It combines clear explanations and carefully selected material, mainly from very recent games, which you won't find in other books. As a chess trainer, I know how difficult it is to find good positional exercises. (On the contrary it seems a relatively easy task to look for tactical positions - computers are a big help in showing us how poorly we can play chess!) The examples from this book will make the life of chess trainers a little bit easier and the life of their students and readers much more interesting! Because you are holding this book, it means that you want to improve your positional skills and perhaps to make an important step towards grandmaster level (or to brush up your positional play if you are a grandmaster already). Then you may be interested to learn the answer to the popular question: "What is the difference between an amateur player and a grandmaster?" Many might think that it's mainly the ability to calculate that helps grandmasters fathom the depths of the position. In some cases this is true, but it also true that grandmasters have generally better opening knowledge; they know more typical plans and pawn structures as well. Perhaps they are better (at least some of them) in endgames too. Still, I would put certain other qualities in first place. By working with amateur players, I have noticed that very often, even if they have the necessary knowledge about the position, they can't use it properly. Grandmasters are trained to make decisions and have much more practical skills. The second factor that struck me was seeing how much energy amateur players waste analysing or calculating moves that a stronger player would simply ignore. This hints of a huge difference in the levels of positional understanding. As a result, an amateur player may spend too much time on weak moves and ideas; meanwhile a grandmaster concentrates on the heart of the position and looks for much better solutions. It is not easy to improve positional understanding. One way is to work on good books with the games of strong players, and to pay special attention to their explanations. Also the careful analysis of your own games may help you to improve your evaluations and to correct some mistakes. Although Aagaard's "approach with this book is not to teach positional understanding, but to teach positional judgement and decision-making", I am sure that solving the many positional exercises from this book will help readers to raise their positional level too. The tools that Aagaard uses in this book look simple. But his method of three questions and his rather modest approach shouldn't deceive readers - if you follow the instructions carefully and concentrate on these important questions, you will most likely focus on the central elements of the position, which will help you to find the solutions of the exercises. Working with this book will train your positional judgement and develop your chess intuition. You will improve your decision-making process and learn some new practical skills. And maybe you will be able to make another step forwards... Artur Yusupov Twice Candidates Finalist Series Introduction Ever since I was a junior I have been a chess trainer. At times my dissatisfaction with the conditions for trainers has caused me to be a player as well; and not without some success. But at the end of the day I have had to accept that my destiny is not to feel comfortable on the stage, but rather in the anonymity of the locker room. I have always cared more for the results of my students than my own, just as I have always had lots of passion for training others, but none for training myself. Over the years I have developed some of the skills necessary to become a decent trainer, not least of all the ability to earn a living by other means! Among other things this means I have become a chess writer. From the moment I started taking pride in my work, I have developed into a not entirely bad one, to the degree where I am finally comfortable enough to publish this series of books, which I have been dreaming about for years. The series title Grandmaster Preparation is of course a little joke, as the five books originally planned do not include any coverage of the opening. But it is also a serious point at the same time. Grandmaster play does not occur in a vacuum, and it consists of much more than opening preparation, random intuition and even more random calculation. There are rules and methods that have been successful for many decades and will continue to be so in the future. One of my main objectives with this project has been to merge this classic understanding of chess with my own ideas and create a serious training plan for ambitious players. This is the most ambitious project I have undertaken in my professional life, and there is no escaping the unavoidable imperfection of the execution. I hope the reader will forgive me in advance for any mistakes, but at the same time offer me the confidence to believe in most of what I claim throughout these books. They are heavily researched and based on my experience of working with close to a thousand individuals over the years: from my own daughters, who recently discovered the joy of capturing a piece, to friends who have been involved in World Championship matches. So, please develop your own understanding of chess by questioning everything I say, but at the same time, please never disregard anything I say as unfounded. When I was a young man I had no access to a classical chess education, and many other grandmasters have had the same experience. It is my hope that this series will help to change this picture in the same way that Mark Dvoretsky's books have, and the way that Artur Yusupov's series of nine books {Fundamentals, Beyond the Basics and Mastery) have given juniors and amateurs a clearly-structured method of improvement. The ultimate goal for this series is to show a path towards playing chess at grandmaster level for those who do not have access to a good trainer. I have worked with some grandmasters who had the kinds of holes in their chess understanding that would baffle the average man on the street. Obviously they excelled in other aspects of the game simultaneously, but over time their weaknesses became obvious to their opponents and their results duly suffered. This series is meant to help those players as well. Jacob Aagaard, Glasgow 2012 My Intentions with this Book There are a lot of good books on the market that will help you to improve your understanding of positional and technical chess. Mainly I would recommend games collections for the person with all the time in the world, but there are also other books that cut positional play into small pieces and explain them well. Sure, this has been done in different ways, but all of them in ways that makes sense and stick in the mind. I absolutely believe that this is a never-ending process and that more books with better explanations are always needed and will therefore always be written. But this book is not one of them. My approach with this book is not to teach positional understanding, but to teach positional judgement and decision-making. My goal is not to make you understand chess better - although I admit that might come as a side-effect none the less - but to use the extensive knowledge you will no doubt already have of chess if you are reading a book in the Grandmaster Preparation series. So rather than providing you with answers, this book presumes that you have already been supplied with plenty of those and that what you need are the right questions. Actually, I would go so far as to say that in order to train your positional judgement: All you need are three questions! It is probably a decade ago that I sat down and tried to make a list of all the relevant questions I could ask my students to make them pay attention to nuances in the training positions I provided them with. I think I had about nine. But some of them I felt were not really relevant to a lot of the positions I looked at; so I ditched them. Others tended to have very similar answers to each other in otherwise quite different positions; merging them seemed reasonable. And bam! All I was left with were three questions.
1. Where are the weaknesses?
2. Which is the worst-placed piece?
3. What is your opponents idea?
I have since used these questions in training with club players of average level (and below) and strong grandmasters. They are equally useful for all levels for a simple reason: Hie purpose of the three questions is to direct your focus Whether we are talking about a strong grandmaster with a great international reputation as a dangerous attacker or a junior with no reputation at all, both need to focus on the same things in order to make better decisions on the board. After all, the pieces move in the same way for everybody, even Kasparov (despite Bareev's claim to the contrary). We will look at the three questions one by one and look at positions in each section. But as always in my books, what I am looking for is not that you understand the theory, but that you can drive the vehicle. Theoretical comprehension is not enough; you need to be able to do it, before you can fully understand it. Hie difference between theory and practice is that in theory there is no difference, but in practice there inevitably is True knowledge is skill - all other types of knowledge are fakes. As an example, I am quite well- read in nutrition, but my severe addiction to chocolate meant that no one would ever have paid any attention to what I said, had I decided to lecture about it. (Now that I have rid myself of this addiction and look more like a man than a balloon again, I no longer feel any pressure to lecture. Funny that, but that is another story, of course.) So what I wish for you to get from this book is the practical ability to make better decisions at the board, so that you can play better moves. This on its own does not separate my approach from many others. What makes this book a bit different from most of the other books on the market is that the emphasis is on the decision, more than on the understanding behind it The prevailing view in Anglo-Saxon chess literature is that good chess comes from calculation, opening preparation and good intuition; the latter clearly being the factor dealing with positional judgement. This is a model that sums up the practice of already strong players in action. Those of us who focus more on general principles as a model for explaining chess and what is going on, are searching for a model that can replicate good play consistently. By breaking wins at the board down into a high number of small skills or principles, we feel that we can communicate and replicate the process that leads to strong moves at the board with a higher frequency. While the first model has a Western bias, the second used to have an East European bias. I would claim that the Soviet domination of chess in the 20th century would be a strong endorsement for the idea of a "classical chess education" with lots of general principles and division of chess skill into small chunks that can easily be explained. Modern examples of this are the books by Mark Dvoretsky and Artur Yusupov. But you do not have to agree with this stance in order to get the full benefit from this book. This book is not seeking to theorize chess, but to make it practical. And for those interested in the argument for general principles, I recommend reading Thinking Inside the Box, which is the theoretical arm of this project. My Intentions with this Book 9 To make chess practical we need to make it simple This is my number one teaching principle. This does not mean that the exercises cannot be painstakingly difficult for some people. Chess is like that - it is difficult to find the various connections in a position when we look at it, tactical, positional and otherwise. But once we know what the best move is, we cannot turn it off and somehow it is easy to understand. This is certainly one of my goals with the solutions written in this book: to give you exactly what you need to know to understand the position after you have struggled to solve it. Another goal is to make the process as simple as possible. You would think that it would be easy to remember three small questions, but experience tells me otherwise. And even if a pupil is able to remember the three questions, he is often unable to remember the bigger question, which should spark these three questions in his mind: What am I looking for in this position? Instead, most players and students will just start calculating. Calculation is a very important skill, but still, it's only one of the analysis tools available The purpose with the three questions is for you to look at the positions in front of you differently. I want you to start looking at the pawn and pieces differently. It is a process and there are a few things I want to state about this that might be obvious, but none the less are good to keep in mind (because have you noticed how often we do not pay attention to obvious things, despite being highly intelligent creatures?). In order to get the most out of this book I would like you to focus on style over speed. Please take the time to ask yourself the three questions, answer them out loud (or maybe even better, on paper) before you start applying the knowledge by looking for the best move. If you do this, you will soon see how focusing your mind on the three important parts of chess that these questions relate to, makes a big difference. Doing it right is more important than getting it right Please remember that although we want to solve the positions, what we are doing here is building your intuition, by repeating these questions to your subconscious so frequently that it will pay attention to these three aspects of chess and their nuances. What level is this book supposed to be aiming at? This book is a part of the Grandmaster Preparation series and therefore aims at developing the skills needed for grandmaster performance. However, the level of the chess is not extensively difficult in this book. The positions in Strategic Play are more elaborate and will probably be more suited for players over 2300. Having said this, some of the positions in this book do offer grandmasters a bit of resistance. One interesting experiment I did with a GM who at the time was rated 2625 or thereabouts, was to give him 12 of these positions and use half an hour on them. He scored 9/12. He did not want any feedback or help with his own play, so the knowledge that the three exercises he had failed at were quite similar from where I was standing did not impress him. However it does underline an important benefit you can get from this book, even if you have reached a high level of positional play already. Pay attention to the exercises you fail to solve As the exercises in this book to a great extent are constructed with the idea of there being a simple solution, failure to solve an exercise will give you important feedback about your own positional judgement. I would encourage you to write down the mistakes you make and when you repeat them (as we all do), note it down as well. In general I do not believe we pay enough attention to our mistakes if we keep the realization of them purely in our heads. Visualizing the Three Questions Throughout this book I shall use a simple graphical system to illustrate the three questions. I shall use circles to identify weaknesses and dotted circles to identify potential weaknesses. I shall use squares to identify the worst-placed pieces and dotted squares to identify pieces that might have problems later on. Finally, I shall use arrows to illustrate the opponents ideas and dotted lines to illustrate potential ideas that may lie far into the future. Let us look at an example. Hikaru Nakamura - Vladimir Kramnik Istanbul (ol) 2012
[diagram]
The circles indicate that c3 and g5 are immediate weaknesses, while it is easy to believe that the f6-square and the king will be weak later on (hence the dotted circles). Whites worst-placed piece is the bishop on g2, but because this is not especially relevant here, I have chosen not to give it a square. Black's pieces are all fighting for the "honour" of being worst-placed, so again I have chosen not to give a square to one (or all) of them, as it would just be confusing. Finally, Black's idea in this position definitely has to be ...h6 to protect his biggest weakness; hence the arrow. Obviously he has other ideas in the position - 99.9% of all positions will contain a multitude of ideas -but what we are looking for is the idea, the one that we should take most seriously. In fact, Black would have a decent position with reasonable compensation for the exchange if he had time to play a couple of useful moves, ...^c4 and ...h6. The latter can be prevented with a nice little move:
32.H6! Bxh6
Black cannot live with the white pawn placed here.
33.Qh5 Ng7 34.Rxg5 Nc6 35.Ng4±
White won on move 80 after various adventures on the way. Let us take another example. Anish Giri - Levon Aronian Istanbul (ol) 2012
[diagram]
The pawn on d4 is weak and the pawns on b2 and c5 are potential weaknesses later on. White is intending ftc3-e4-d6. Blacks worst piece by far is the bishop on c8 (and White's the knight on bl). All of this inspires Black to strike at the main weakness with a pawn sacrifice that opens up the position before White has managed to get his pieces out. From looking passive and about to be behind in development, Black becomes very active and solves the problems with his pawn structure that were making the c8-bishop bad. The pawn will be regained soon enough.
18...e5! 19.d5
19.dxe5 Qe7 20.f4 Sd8! and it is hard for White to make progress. 20.5^c3 is possibly better,
but Black has solved all his problems and should be looking for a way to play for an advantage.
19...6?!
Stronger is 19...cxd5 followed by ...Qe7, when White would find the both c5-pawn and the b2-pawn to be unpleasantly weak.
20.dxc6 e4 21.cxb7 Jlxb7 22.c6 Jla6 23.Qb3?!
Passive play is not a good idea in a position like this, where your opponent seems to be holding all the trumps. Visualizing the Three Questions 13 It seems that 23.c7!? was better. 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 After 23...Qe7 24.Qc6 e3 25.^hl exf2 26.5}c3 the position is desperately unclear.
23...Sc8l 24.Nc3 Sxc6 25.Nd5 lc5!+ 26j.fl f4 27.Nxf4 Axfif 28.<&hl Sb6 29.Hc2 e3
8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 Black's advantage is colossal and led to a victory on move 48.
[diagram]
The Three Questions in Action Please have a look at the following five positions for 5-10 minutes each and decide what you would do. Remember to ask yourself the following questions: 1) Where are the weaknesses? 2) Which is the worst-placed piece? 3) What is my opponent's idea?
[diagram]
A
These five positions all come from one of my own games. The game is in no way a pretty sight: two active players decided to use the other player's weaknesses by playing a technical game. While the game is lacking in the beauty of its ideas, it is rich in instructional potential. It is a game revolving around the basics and how things destabilize when the players make simple mistakes. I had played against Surya once before, in 2008 in the Spanish league. I had pleasant memories of this game, not least because I made my only draw in an otherwise abysmal five rounds. At the closing dinner my team captain expressed deep sympathy for my Vi/5 against five 2600+ grandmasters. He knew how it felt, having made the same score on Board Four. At the end of the evening I was fired with a toast, a handshake and the trophy for worst score as a souvenir. I was very pleased; it is maybe the prettiest of my trophies and no one checks the plaque anyway! Surya Shekhar Ganguly - Jacob Aagaard Helsingor 2010 l.d4!? I was expecting l.e4, which suits his style better. My plan was to aim for solidity.
1...6
Okay, missed solidity on move one. At the moment I am playing the Leningrad.
2.&B 3.g3
I recalled that the Leningrad sucks, so time for a change of heart.
3...e6 4.Ng2 d5
The Stonewall. I wrote a book on it in 2000 and updated it for the German edition in
2007. This is solid.
5.O-O JU6 6.c4 c6 7.Qfc2
I got a bit nervous. Surya might actually have done his homework - in this case I am about to play against my own creation, as White's only real try for an advantage at this point is probably to follow Grandmaster Repertoire 2: l.d4 - Volume Two by Boris Avrukh.
7...O-O
[diagram]
8.b3?!
This is what I call an aesthetic move. And that is not a compliment. To me, aesthetic moves are moves that look good, but are played without an idea. Obviously White is intending to put his bishop on b2; which is sort of what White usually does in this kind of position, right? The problem is, once you have put your bishop on b2 and your knight on d2, then what? These sort of "good-looking" moves without a plan are what aspiring players' games are full of until they learn to analyse a position through other prisms than "I go there and he goes there". The worrisome line starts with: 8.Nc3 Qe7
9.Rbl! with the idea of b4-b5 with lots of play
on the queenside. In this set-up the queen has a function on c2 - it protects the knight and plans to invade the c-file. It is not so easy for The Three Questions in Action 17 Black to continue with a sensible move and White is happy to follow up with at an opportune moment.
8...Qe7 9.Bb2
I took some time to look at the position and my opponent's body language. He did not look at home in the position (nor did he look nervous) and his set-up did not look threatening. Standard play would be 9...Ne4 followed by
10...b6 or ..Bd7-e8-h5. But his feeble set-up
inspired me to try a more ambitious plan I had seen in some of Artur Yusupov's games.
9...b5!? 10.Nbd2 a5
Black is seeking to dominate the queenside and get the bishop active on a6. Il.Ne5 a4 12.cxb5 Hilariously, the computer thinks White is a bit better after 12.Bad a3 13.J,al b4!. 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 Ask the bishop on al what he really thinks about this evaluation!
12...a3
Here I offered a draw. I thought I was maybe already better, but I really had these warm feelings towards Surya because of this draw in
2008. I owed him. However, he did not want
to draw with me quickly again and decided to face the music.
[diagram]
13 J,cl cxb5 I4.Nd6
[diagram]
Here I was thinking: Just don't allow Bg5, just don't allow jkg5... The bishop is decreasing in value and White has a serious problem with the c3-square; especially once I play ...b5-b4. It would be moronic to let him prevent me from bringing a knight to e4. I4...b4? Okay, so I am a moron. It will now take forever to fight for the c3-square. This is how it goes; understanding what you need to do is not enough, you actually have to do it. Practice beats theory once again... I4...Ne4! 15.^,f4 b4

[diagram]
and either ...^,b7 or ...^,a6 leads to at least even chances for Black.
15.1g5!
Now there is a long way from b8 to c3. Against normal play it should be impossible to make it so far without being stopped, blocked or shot down; even if you are a fine prize- winning stallion.
19.Qxd3 5^a6
It might seem ridiculous, but the position is of such a slow nature that the knight is heading for c3. If it gets there, I will be okay.
20.e3 Sfc8 21 Jtfl 4k7
15..JU6 16.Sfcl 7
This move is explained by the realization that 16...Sc8? 17.Qxc8| is not best.
17 Axis gxfi6!?
This decision might look sound, but fracturing my pawn structure is a long-term annoyance. That's the negative. The positive is that it fights convincingly for the e5- square. I instinctively felt compelled to play this, because my development is lacking and because the rook would be misplaced on f6. Specifically I was worried about 17...Rxf6
18.e3! Bf8 19.ik,fl±, when White is able to
exchange the right bishops.
[diagram]
The position is only a bit better for White, but still felt uncomfortable. I think a different player might have avoided accepting the extra weakness, and been equally right to do so.
18.Nd3 Nxd3
18...Qe7!? 19.£k5 Mh5 was possible, but
again I was not happy with e2-e3 and "S,g2-fl.
[diagram]
22.Sc2?
This is the second moment where Black's strategy of choosing a mud-fight is rewarded. Black is planning ...^c7-e8-d6-e4-c3. White can of course stop this with f2-f3 when we get that far, but he would prefer not to commit his pawns in any way, and not to weaken his dark squares. Obviously I expected Surya to play f3 at some point, but here I really expected him to find
22.Nel! Be7 23.Qd2 Ne8 24.Nd3±
[diagram]
The Three Questions in Action 19 Here I cannot play ...ftd6 for a number of reasons. White can then start his regrouping and look forward to some active play. This is elementary positional play and, like me, he sort of understood it, but his thought process did not support him ending up playing it! A clear example of excessive calculation. 22 ...Be7?! Making space for the knight; however, the choice of square, at the beginning of time trouble, is wrong. I wanted to protect f6, which is too abstract. The option of playing ..Jkh6 is much more important, as I quickly realized. 22..Jkf8! is thus right.
23.Sacl Ne8 24.Nh4 Nd6
8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1
25.Ng2?
This was actually the move I expected, but it is a serious mistake. Obviously the knight is well-placed on f4, but we should not forget that the black knight is on its way to c3. This is the most important single aspect of the position and White should be very sure that the knight is not well placed on e4 before he allows it to go there. But as can be understood, we both missed that I could play 25...Ne4!.
[diagram]
We thought that 26.Qb5 was a major problem, but 26...Qxb5 27.Sxc8f Qe8! is equal. The power of the c3-square and the weakness of the a2-pawn are very important. As so often in chess, this is a positional mistake based on a tactical oversight. White can also try 26.^f4, but it is not a serious problem: 26...Rxc2 27.Sxc2 Qd7
28.Qb5!? (28.Ne2 Sc8) 28...Qxb5 29.Bxb5
Nf7
[diagram]
30Ae2 Nc3! 31.Qxc3 Rc8 and the ending is drawn. For this reason, it was time to play 25.f3 to keep a slight edge. The e3-pawn is weakened, but this is far less serious than the alternative.
25..Jfd7?
I understood the demands of the position; I was just in poor form. Practice over theory...
26.5}f4 Rxc2 27.Rxc2 Sc8
I would of course like to play 27...Ne4, but after 28.Qb5 Qxb5 29.Bxb5 Nf7 30j,d7 Ba6 I would not have time to play 31...Nc3. After
31.fce2 Sa7 32.Ac6! Bd6 333
[diagram]
White is a bit better. Thus I preferred to keep the queens on the board for the moment.
[diagram]
28.ffdl?
This is absolutely incredible. Who would have thought that a player of this level, who works for the world champion, would allow a knight to come from b8 to c3 in such a position?
28.f3± was perpetually better for White,
although it would of course not be so easy to actually win it.
28...Sxc2 29.Rxc2 Ne4 30.Nd3 Nc3
Yes! I made it. I sort of relaxed here, with very little time on the clock.
31.Ne2
White does not have any tactical options here. After 31.g4? Black will reply 31...Nd6! with the following lines:
[diagram]
32.Nh5 Qf7! and Black is already much better.
I will play ...<^>f8-e7, ...fxg4 and ...f5.
32.gxf5 jbcf4 33.exf4 Qg7t 34.^hl exf5
35 Jxf5 Qh6+ and White will not benefit a
lot from winning the h7-pawn; the queen and bishop are the wrong way around. However, the exchange of queens (h6-f4-f3-dl) would mean the immediate end of the game, as the a2-pawn falls.
[diagram]
31...51xe2t?
This does not make a lot of sense. I did not play ...5}b8-a6-c7-e8-d6-e4-c3 simply to exchange the knight and give away all of my counterplay.
31...Qc6 was a good deal better. I am not
aiming to do anything at all, except take back on c3 with the pawn. He of course will put the bishop on c2, but it will be sort of occupied, and the position is a dead draw.
32.Qxe2 IflB 33.&A Rc7 34.Ng2 Ad6
35JfB
35.. Jfg7?? 36.Nxf5!
Which instantly worked. Here I lost on time, unable to find a move. After 36...^f7
37.Qh5t Ne7 38.Qxh7 Qxh7 39.Nxh7 there
is no hope. For example: 39...f5 40.^g8! and the bishop is not trapped, but rather ideally placed. 1-0 Not pretty, but very instructive. Chess is far easier to understand than it is to play, so please do go through the exercises and get these simple things under control! 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 l During the game and in the post mortem analysis, I was of the opinion that White had good chances to win this ending, and I managed to convince Surya and some other strong players. But a technically inclined player like Sabino Brunello was much better at evaluating this position than I. With precise defensive moves (with the queen) he proved that it was impossible for White to penetrate to the weaknesses on e6 and h7, and thus a not too difficult draw, had I only made it past the time control... So, Surya's belief during the game that the position was a draw was accurate, and it was entirely justified to simply play for tricks.

[diagram]
White to play White has a lead in development; in return for this Black has the two bishops. White has several tempting options, but which one will allow him to fully exploit Black's weaknesses: his pawns, the king and the hook created by the pawn on f6? If I had to point to one part of positional chess that is essential, it would be having a reasonable understanding of weaknesses. When I went to a lecture by Mark Dvoretsky in 2000 I was already a reasonable player. My highest rating had been 2445 and I had been one game away from a grandmaster norm. Still, looking back to some discussions he had there, it was clear that I had the energy of a young man and decent tactical skills, but no understanding of weaknesses and the consequences of them. If you fear this might be you, then hopefully this book will be fantastic for you. Obviously we are not starting from scratch, but if you have reached a level where you think a book called "Grandmaster Preparation" might work for you, maybe what you need is to get some practical dimensions added to your understanding of weaknesses. Before we go through the basic forms of weaknesses like a firestorm, I would like to share a simple game where the result is decided by small weaknesses escalating over time. What I intend to show with this game is how simple the positional aspects really are - and how difficult they are to handle. Aronian does not make any obvious positional mistakes. What happens is that he takes a few liberties to make the game a bit more lively (7...g6), then he finds himself in a slightly unpleasant position and needs to find a way to solve his problems. This is not so easy and in the end it all falls down because of a tactical oversight. But the beginning of all the problems came from the weakening of the queenside (6...a6), which was fully justified, but came with some obligations. These increased until eventually Black had more problems than he could handle. Vladimir Kramnik - Levon Aronian Istanbul (ol) 2012 l.d4 d5 2.c4 c6 3&c3 4.cxd5 This game was played on Board One in the Olympiad between the two favourites and later joint winners (with Armenia taking gold on tie-break). Kramnik seems to think that a 2-2 result would not be a disaster and that Russia are favourites on the last three boards. In reality the 2-2 was only achieved by Kramnik's win in this game, but the players had no way of knowing this at this point.
4...cxd5 5 Jkf4 Nc6 6.e3 a6 7.M,d3
[diagram]
7... g6
A bit too creative for my taste. The bishop is just not well placed on g7 in this system, where it can only come alive if Black plays ...e5 later on. The plus side is of course that this move prepares the exchange of the light- squared bishops. 7..Jtg4 is the main line with a sound score here. I do not follow the theory, but nor do I think that Kramnik had anything seriously venomous ready here.
8.h3
Kramnik clearly wants to put the knight on f3 without allowing ..Bg4. Chapter 1 - Weaknesses 25
8...1B 9.&B
I wonder if Aronian was intending to play
9.ibcf5 gxf5 10.^f3 Bg8!? and leave the king
in the centre? This is the only reason I can find for taking on d3 on the next move - barring indecision. I am not sure this would be fully sound, but in any case I already prefer White ever so slightly.
9.. Jbtd3
9...^g7 10Jbcf5 gxf5 would not give Black
control of the g-file immediately, but ...O-O, ...^hS and ...Rg8 could be considered. However, I am not sure Kramnik would have taken on f5. 10Jfxd3 Bg7 11.O-O O-O 12.Sfcl e6 It is fair to say that the opening is over. The minor pieces are out and the kings are safe. A long-term strategy for the middlegame should be devised. To be able to do so successfully, we need to take into consideration the weaknesses in the position. Despite some artificial debate relating to the e4- and e5-squares, it is my opinion that the real weaknesses are the following:
[diagram]
The reason for the c7-square being weak and not the c2-square is obvious - the bishop on f4 and the slight lead in development White possesses. Also, the c5-square is weaker than the c4-square, simply because White can get there faster. The b2-pawn is undefended, but it is not easy for Black to deliver a serious attack on it at the moment. The b6-square is slightly weakened by the advance of the a-pawn, but it is not high on our current list of priorities, even if it does come into play in some variations. Whites plan is to aim at the b7- and c7-weaknesses by moving his pieces in that direction.
13.Na4 $Se4 14.4&c5 5}xc5 15.Sxc5
[diagram]
White might not have an advantage, but his position is visibly more active. He arrives first to the c-file and his minor pieces are well placed. At the moment the only real weakness in the black position is the c7-square, but there is also the b7/a6-constellation, which it is terribly difficult for Black to deal with.
15..Jfd7
Black is preparing to fight for the c-file.
15...Qb6 would threaten the trick ...e5!, but
White has 16.@c2!±.
16.Bad Sfc8
The first phase of the mobilization has ended. Now White needs to pay attention to the idea of ...J,f8 followed by ...Nb4.
17.a3! 18.S5c2
8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1
18...K
In the press conference right after the game, Kramnik said that maybe this move was partly to blame for Blacks downfall. I think this is too harsh. Certainly this move (intended to reinforce the e5-square) weakens the pawn on e6, adding some responsibilities for Black. However, the benefits are worth it. These extra responsibilities needed to be dealt with rapidly and with accuracy; and it seems that Black did not find the right way to do so in the game. This is always the case with positions that are under a bit of pressure. You need to play accurately at some moments, and if you don't, your position can rapidly become worse and worse.
18...^,d6 was an alternative.
[diagram]
In this case we see that the b6-square is a weakness, and Black is under a bit of pressure after 19.Jbcd6 Qxd6 20.Qb3! Sab8 (20...b5 21.Sc5 Ne7 22.Qc3± is also unpleasant) 21.Qb6±. 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 Can Black hold after 21...Qc7 or 21...Qd8, you might ask? I would think so, but the pressure would continue. White has ideas like Qf3-e5-d3, waiting for the right moment to jump to c5. Black is never fully forgiven for playing ...a6 early on!
19.Nd2
8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1
19...1d6?!
This move works poorly in combination with ...f6. Black's positional problems required a more radical solution, which he might not have felt entirely happy with during the game
[diagram]
Chapter 1 - Weaknesses 27 - or dare I suggest - he may not even have seen. The right way to play was to fight for the c-file immediately, like a boxer attacking with his head first: 19...5W!! If Black has time to play ...Rxc2, he will be fine. So the only danger is
20.Rc7 Qe8.
8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 But White has no strong follow-up. Black will play ...Nb5 on almost anything, with or without taking on c7 first. For example:
21.£}b3 ftb5 22.87c2 Rxc2 23.Qxc2 £}d6
and Black has managed to coordinate his pieces and defend his weaknesses successfully.
20.ilxd613fxd6 21.5}b3
We can see how the exchange of the dark- squared bishops has increased the weakness of the dark squares in the black position. Black has to do something about this quickly.
[diagram]
21...Ec7?
Quite a natural move, which would have been successful had White not had a tactical way to punish it. It is understandable that Aronian did not want to play 21...b6, when you look at the way it weakens the a6- pawn and in the case of a later ...a5, the b5- square. However, the prospect of the white knight coming in to pressurize the a6/b7/c6- constellation should have spooked him. White is still better of course, but the advantage is long-term and only small. White can play something like 22.£}d2± and then try to create further weaknesses elsewhere on the board.
22.Na5! Sac8
This is probably a bit naive of Black. He may have been expecting White to take a zillion times on c6 and then shake hands at move 30.
22...Qd7 was necessary, but after something
like 23.Sc5 Sac8 24.Qc3± White's advantage is serious. We have reached a typical moment in chess strategy. White has mobilized all of his forces. It is time to look for a revolution (a violent change of the status quo) as he is perfectly placed for it. If it does not exist, he will have to manoeuvre and try to outplay his opponent slowly. But if it exists, it is most likely to exist right here, right now.
[diagram]
23.Nxb711 Sxb7 24.Qxa6 Sbc7 25.b4

Accurate, although White should also win after 26.b5 ^e7 27.Sxc7 Sxc7 28.Sxc7 Rxc7
29.Qxe6t ^g7 30.a4 with best play. This line
indicates that Aronian failed to see the knight sacrifice completely (and thus was expecting the game to just end in a draw), as he would never have allowed this either, had he seen it. And there is no subtlety to miss in this line at all.
26..Jfe8
Black is just lost.
26...Qd6 is best met with 27.Rc3! followed by
b4-b5.
26...6.7 is objectively best according to my

28.Qxc6! Qxc6 29.Hxc6 Rxc6 30.bxc6
White will break through on the kingside while pushing the two pawns forward on the queenside to distract his opponent. Still, Black could have tried this, with the idea of e7-d8 and then ...Ha7 - but it should never ever work.

1-0 Everyone knows what a weakness is, but it is not so easy to define. My attempt at a definition would be: A square of importance, which is poorly defended (if at all), and which can be exploited. This square can be unoccupied, or occupied by a pawn or piece.
[diagram]
27.b5
Forcing a win. Let us look at some examples of this. Chapter 1 - Weaknesses 29 Alexander Grischuk - Dimitrios Mastrovasilis Istanbul (ol) 2012
[diagram]
The c5-pawn is a serious weakness in the black position, and after 35.^e3! Black was in trouble. The pawns on a7, c6, f5 and h7 are also a bit weak, but in reality they are much harder to attack and therefore of less importance. And that is what is important about weaknesses - the ease or difficulty of defending them in the short term and in the long term. Pawns In the next example we see Kramnik in a different scenario; this time he is under pressure. His way to deal with it is, however, rather unfortunate. He tries to get active, at the cost of weakening his pawns on the queenside. Unfortunately, because of the long-term weakness of his kingside, eventually it becomes clear that this is a very dangerous strategy. What I want you to pay attention to is the combination of short-term and long-term pawn weaknesses and how they affect each other; and how together they create extra problems. Vladimir Kramnik - Vassily Ivanchuk Istanbul (ol) 2012
[diagram]
White came out of the opening in poor but not desperate shape. He has a weak square on d3 and is under pressure down the long diagonal. We also see that the pawns on e4 and h4 are seriously limiting the white pawns, leading f2 and g2 to be long-term weaknesses. But the big problem at the moment is that Black is planning to exploit the hook (more about this later) on b3 to open up the a-file to come in and attack f2, which can easily become weak; and indeed this is what happened in the game. White needs to solve these issues, and preferably sooner rather than later. He could try 23.&fl simply to improve the king, although there are some moves that would give White problems.
23.Na4?
Kramnik certainly had a tactical idea behind this move. The problem is that the weakening of the a-pawns is considerable and no amount of calculation can make up for this subsequently. So why did Kramnik play this? Did he go insanely deep and decide that he could draw the ending? Or more realistically, did he have a bad day and overlook something? I believe the latter.
23.i^a3 would not fully work: 23...£}xb3
24.^xe4 £}a5 25.c5 Qc4 26.Sd3 Jke5?
So for this reason 23.Sdl!? is a decent move. The main point behind this move is that the rook is no longer in the way of J,a3xf8. The idea is that after 23...a5 White can play
24..1,a3! Jbcc3 25 Jbcc5 with full equality.
Thus 23...Nfe6 seems to be the strongest option. Black is certainly a little more comfortable after 24.£}xe6 Nxe6 25.^a4 ibcb2 26.£}xb2 ^f8?. Black has more space and White will have to use a few moves to bring the knight back into the game.
23.Ndl is better than the game, if nothing
else. After 23..Jkxb2 24.Nxb2 a5? we have a position that Ivanchuk could have chosen in the game (after 23.Na4 Jbtb2 White could not play 24.ftxc5? "i,a3!). I guess that Kramnik wanted his knight to be on a4 in other lines, but the value of this is seriously in doubt.
23...4}xa4 24.ilxg7 Nxg7 25.bxa4 Se8
8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1
26.a5
I think this is the best option. Kramnik had probably found that there was something
[diagram]
wrong with what he had intended, and decided to go for a dangerous, though not hopeless, ending.
26.^fl
This was the alternative. Best play might look something like this:
26...Se5 27.Ne2 Sc5 28.Sd4 f5
[diagram]
Black is threatening ...Nf6 followed by ...£}e6, when he would win a pawn, so White has to act immediately.
29.f3exf3 30.gxf3g5 31.f4
Forced again, to avoid ...Nf6 and ...fte6.
31...6e6 32.Sd6 Nf7 33.Sd7t

In Chess Today, Alexander Baburin called this a "winnable ending". I am not entirely certain about this, but it is clear that Black is very close to the full point with his extra pawn. In the end Ivanchuk could not find a plan to create the greatest difficulties for his opponent, and the game was drawn on move 77. The next example is also somewhat dynamic, but then most high-level chess is. It illustrates the weakness of the c5-pawn in combination with the weakening of the b6- and e6-squares, created by the advance of the pawns (once again those moves had good functions; all moves will weaken the control over at least one square). Baskaran Adhiban - S.P. Sethuraman World U-16, VungTau 2008
[diagram]
Black has the two bishops, but has paid a high price for them. His knight is still stuck on g8 and his c-pawn is weak. It was these factors that inspired White to go for a creative idea based on attacking the c5-pawn as well as exploiting the weakened squares discussed above. Il.Na4!? c4 12.Nb6 White is continuing with his idea. 12.Nc5= was also reasonable.
12...Sd8 13.Nd4!
[diagram]
This was the point. Everything is hanging and Black has problems defending the c4- pawn. This loses a pawn without a fight; there was only one way to battle on.
13...1g4!
Black wins an important tempo, making it possible to take the knight on b6 and save the pawn on c4. I4.f3 cxb6 15.fxg4 j^,c5! This pin is essential to slow White down.

This is the only consistent move, although Black is also fighting for equality after I6.c3 b5 17.Nc2Ne7 18.g5±.
16...jbce3t 17.Nxe3 b5 18.£}f5
8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 White's position is apparently overwhelming, but if you look at the basic elements (the worst-placed piece is the g8-knight, the g4- pawn is weak and White is planning to win a pawn) we can see that Black can fight back with an active move:
18...fth6! 19.Sxd8t
White goes for a better rook ending. Black would also have reasonable drawing chances after 19.£}xg7t 20.^h5 ^xg4
21.Sdfl Sd6±.
^...^xdS 20.Hdlt Nc7 21.^xh6 gxh6 22.h3 Sg8 23.Sd2!±

8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 White is planning S£2-f5 with enduring pressure. Black would have to play really well to hold this ending. Still, this is much better than the game. 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1

White won on move 38. Squares We have already touched a little on weakened squares with the above example. The main difference between weak pawns and weak squares (looking beyond the price tag here) is probably that weakened pawns are generally static in nature, while weakened squares usually create dynamic possibilities. This is well illustrated in the following example: Peter Heine Nielsen - Alexander Areshchenko Germany 2011
[diagram]
White has succeeded greatly on the queenside, while Black has not established more than a threat to f2 on the kingside. If White now had played 29.f3!, he would have left Black with great problems and more or less no counterplay; the g3-pawn is slightly weakened, but this is in the long term as there is no quick way to get to it. Instead he weakened the f3-square (as well as the d3- pawn) in his efforts to defend f2, giving Black the counterplay necessary to survive. Moving the f-pawn might at first feel a bit artificial, but once you start looking at it seriously, it becomes very attractive. Therefore I suspect that Peter did not seriously look at this non-standard move. If he had, he probably would have played it. Chess is like that sometimes, you decide to save time for later decisions (unless you have already spent it on prior ones), not suspecting that this was the right moment. Getting better at understanding when we have to make a serious choice is one of the most elusive, but at the same time most important, skills for a strong chess player to develop.
29.e4? W(5l
There is an immediate threat to the d3-pawn.

30.1el
After 30.Qd2?! Black has a fantastic idea:
30...Sf7!! (Instead, 30...^xb6 31.Baxb6 Sxb6
32.Sxb6 Sd8 33.Sb7! offers White enough
counterplay to draw, although even this might have been disappointing for him after being so much better.) 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 Black's idea is either ...?}f8-e6-g5 with a strong attack, or taking twice on b6 and playing ...Sd7.
30...Nxb6 31.Sbxb6 Hxb6
8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1
32.Sxb6?
It was essential to force the exchange of rooks in order to survive. 32.Qxb6 Bf6 33.Qa7 Sxa6
34.Qxa6 Qxd3 35.Qb5 would have been the
right way to play, as after 35...Qxe4 36.Nd2 White can still hold the balance. We could look at this conceptually and say
[diagram]
that the f2-pawn and the white king are only weak if the rooks remain on the board. Without them the white bishop has more potential and White will make the draw. But this is rationalizing after the fact; something that is really useful to do when we analyse games - to develop our understanding/intuition - but not of much help when you have a few minutes to choose between two seemingly unattractive options.
32.. Jfxd3 33.Sb7?!
A better chance to defend would have been
33.Qbl Qxc4 34.5=?b7?, but once things start
going against you, it is very hard to find the best chances.
33...Qxe4+
Black is in full control. He won on move 55. The next example is really interesting when it comes to discussing the weakness of squares and to what extent this can help you find the right plan. Garry Kasparov - Francisco Vallejo Pons Linares 2004
[diagram]
There are a few weaknesses in the black position (and an obvious weakness on d5 Chapter 1 - Weaknesses 35 in the white position). The weakness of the constellation b6/c5/d6 is in my opinion rather obvious, but of course there is also the slight weakening of the black kingside through the ...h7-h6 advance. I seriously doubt whether I would have believed the latter to be the more important before I saw this game, but reading Dokhoian's variations (the words below are mine, the lines his) in New in Chess Magazine actually convinced me that this was the case. 22Jfcl Dokhoian was full of praise for this move. The idea is quite stunning - White spends time rearranging his queen and light-squared bishop to give the duo a bit more bite. As things transpire in the game, it seems as if Black cannot get his defence organized in time.
22...bxc5 23.1b 1 Ra7
23...^,f6? 24.Qc2 g6 might look like a
natural way to defend against the threat of mate. But once again we see the effect of the slight weakening of the kingside by the initial advance of the h-pawn. The e6/f7/g6- constellation sorely lacks the support of the h-pawn.
[diagram]
White strikes with 25.Rxe6!, when Black's various options do not work. He cannot accept the sacrifice as White brings in reinforcements after the initial checks (as always, the concept of evolution/revolution/evolution must be understood in order to play attacking chess) with Nh4-g6. So, if Black is not to end up with a pawn less, he needs to try 25...cxd4. Here White establishes his superiority with:
26.Bd6 Qa7 27.Nxd4 ge8 28.Sxe8t Sxe8
29.Nf5!±
24 JTc2 fof6 25.Ne5 Sd5
The white knight is obviously heading for g4, but this is not the only bad thing that can happen to the black position. Knights can go backwards, but in the hands of great attackers, they usually go forwards:
25...Nf8
[diagram]
26.ftxf7! Nxf7 27.Qg6t Nf8
The king has to retreat to this square to support the bishop. After 27...^8 28.Sxe6 Black can only resign. White has ideas with jbcc5 followed by Sxf6, with mate. Also Sdel is on the way.
[diagram]
28.Bf5!! Ba6
If Black were to accept this second sacrifice, he would find that after 28...exf5 29.Sxe7 ^xe7, White does not rush to take on c5, but plays more brutally with 30.@xg7t Ne6 31.Selt ^e4 32Jkxc5, with a winning attack.
29.Jbce6 Jkd6 30.dxc5 Mb8 31 Jkb2
Black has not succumbed immediately, but he will not last forever either.
25...^,d6 also fails to solve all of Blacks
problems, but maybe it was the lesser evil. White can play 26.£k4 M,e7 27.Jbcc5 ibcc5
28.dxc5 Qxc5 29.^d6±.
But he can also be more adventurous:
26.Nxf7!? Nxf7 27.Qg6t Nf8 28.Sxe6 Ba6

28.h4!?
White still has a considerable advantage after this move, but as Dokhoian points out, White had a convincing and direct way to end the game in: 28.g4! Sg5 29.Qh7t &f<8
[diagram]
30.Bf5!! Bd6 (30...exf5 31.Sxe7) 31 JTxh6t
Sg7 32.Rxe6 6ce6 33.Jbce6 and wins. In addition to this, engines now point out the more brutal and less intuitive 28.Bxe6! fxe6 29.Qe2!. Black seems unable to defend himself, even with an extra rook; the position of the pieces on the queenside is too poor. A possible line is 29. ..Nf8 30.@xe6 Rg5 31 Jbcc5 Bxc5 32.Qxf6t Ng8 33.Qe6t Nf8 34.dxc5 and there is no real defence against the rook coming to d7.

1-0 Does this mean that our first impressions were wrong? I believed so initially and gave the position to Sabino Brunello to solve, telling him that it was "special". However, he did not find anything special about it, but rather emphasized the weakness of the b6/c5/d6- constellation.
22.Nd2
[diagram]
In order to take advantage of the weak squares, Sabino transfers the most inactive piece towards squares where it can control two of them, either e4 (c5/d6) or c4 (b6/d6).
22...bxc5
This feels like a good test of Whites plan, and as this was the move Vallejo played in the game, I decided that this should be the right way of dealing with my positionally-inclined student's reluctance to play for mate. But this weakens the b6-square and thus allows White to demonstrate his advantage.

The c5-pawn is immune due to Nb6 tricks. White now has a considerable number of options, all of them leaving Black in big trouble. Another reasonable move is:
22..MG
Maybe, at the end of the day, Black would be relatively better off after 22...b5±, although this would leave him with various positional defects. A logical way of continuing is: 23.J,cl la6 24.Nf3 Ifb7

24.jbcc5 Rc7 25Jxe7 Qxe7 26.5} c5
[diagram]
White has a great advantage; it is very difficult for Black to get rid of the knight from c5 and the c6- and a5-pawns are perpetual problems. I agreed that White's play was indeed quite convincing at this point. Returning to the game continuation, I realized that Black's 23rd move was rather artificial. What is the queen meant to be doing on a7? Dokhoian does not discuss the natural
23. ..£ff6!, when the knight immediately
defends the h7-square, as well as clearing the way for the other pieces. 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 White cannot attack in the same way as in the game. Black will play ...jhd6 after putting the rook on d5, and compared to the game the black king will have an escape square on e7, eliminating the Ng4-ideas. And if White tries to occupy the dark squares on the queenside he will find that he has wasted important time. After something like
24.jbcc5 ikxc5 25.dxc5 Jka6 White's advantage
is less dramatic, if it is there at all. The knight will not make it to d6, as it did in Sabino's variation. So, although Kasparov's play was majestic indeed, his 22nd move was probably more interesting than great. A plan based on taking advantage of the biggest weaknesses was objectively more justified. Hooks The concept of hooks is something that even some grandmasters have not come across, but which still constitutes an important part of the understanding of what a weakness is.
[diagram]
Chapter 1 - Weaknesses 39 A hook is a pawn, usually advanced, which can be challenged. An example is the Kramnik - Ivanchuk game from above.
[diagram]
By advancing his a-pawn, Black will be able to create a weakness out of the b3-pawn. Taking on a4 would not reduce this effect. As another example, here is a more tactical situation, in which the hook is the h6-pawn. Heiner Matthias - Davit Shengelia Germany 2005
[diagram]
White has no advantage whatsoever. The weakness of the d6-pawn is not detrimental and is easily balanced by the possibility of counterplay with ...d5 and down the c-file. On the other hand, White has no reason to be worse either. He is fairly active and Black has no obvious way to bring his knight to c3. There is one other defect in the black position, the advanced h-pawn. This has the advantage of providing the king with an escape route, in the event of a revolt, but has at the same time weakened the foundations of his castle. In the game, White was successful in exploiting this in classic style.
28.g4 Rc5 29.Nb5 Sac6 30.Scl Sb8?!
This seems a bit planless; Black is not realistically going to sacrifice on b5. Shengelia was probably looking for a way to complicate matters, in order to outplay his lower-rated opponent.
30...d5 was sensible. Black is not worse.
8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1
31.h4!±
White takes a serious step forward towards exploiting the h6-hook. We can now see that the pawn would have been better on h7 as things have turned out. As always, the problem is not that Black played ...h6 once upon a time, but that he did not meet the challenges that followed from there.
31...%3 32.Sd3 Sbb6?!
This is a bit artificial. Better was 32...fte8±, when Black can consider taking the h4-pawn, if allowed.

1-0 The following example is also quite standard for how to exploit a weakened pawn structure. The g6-pawn is a hook, but it is also a slightly weakened point. Michael Adams - Giorgi Giorgadze Groningen (2.1) 1997
[diagram]
Blacks kingside has been slightly weakened by the exchange of his h-pawn for the white e-pawn. After the advance of the white h-pawn, Black will have significant problems with his structure, which would not be the case if the pawn was still on g7.

Black's last real chance to save the game came through 33...Sxa7 34.Sxa7 jtd8!.
[diagram]
Chapter 1 - Weaknesses 41 Black is aiming to get the badly-placed bishop to the c5-square, where it would help the position somewhat. White is still better, but Black can resist quite a lot. I would guess that Giorgadze failed to see this option simply because the idea of leaving the white rook unchallenged on the 7th rank seemed dangerous. And certainly it is dangerous, but the dangers connected with doing nothing are considerable too.
34.S7a6!
With this move, White keeps control over the a-file, leaves Black with the poorly-placed rook on e7 and delays/p revents the bishop on f6 making it to b6 in the (near) future.
34...Qd7 35.&fl±
35.ibcf5!? was perhaps stronger at this point.
Black would have more difficulties defending the pawn on f5 than he would have on g6. But Adams prefers to keep the control that comes with having a good knight against a bad bishop.

1-0 Let's now return to a position from earlier in the chapter. Baskaran Adhiban - S.P. Sethuraman World U-16, VungTau 2008
[diagram]
This time around we shall concentrate a bit more on the weak king in the centre (despite the exchange of queens, the king is still unsafe), and the hook that the pawn on f6 represents. Looking at these we can see that there is a much more aggressive continuation: 11 .e5!! fice5 The computer recommends that Black should play ll..Jbce5 12.£}xe5 fxe5, when after 13.Jbcc5 it has no real defence against Shelxe5 (or f2-f4xe5). Maybe this is Black's best option, but in that case White's strategy is definitely right!
12.^e4
With the idea of ikxc5 should Black defend the bishop, which would lead to a quick deterioration of the black position.
12...Be7 13.ftxe5
8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 Black is still struggling desperately with his development. The next moves are likely to be Shel and jkf4, after which it will be very difficult for Black to avoid losing something. King's position We all play for mate; some just do it in a more indirect way than others - Peter Heine Nielsen We have a tendency to focus on static factors when we talk about positional play, but we must not neglect dynamic factors. The safety of the king is always a factor, and when we talk about weaknesses it would make no sense not to include weaknesses around the king.
[diagram]
Take the following example: N.N. - Finn Nohr Aarhus 1992
[diagram]
White is of course unpleasantly pinned on f2, which makes the defence of the g2-square more difficult. In a chaotic position like this, with pins from d4 to gl and e2 to a2, an X-ray from c8 to g4, and where Black has sacrificed material, it is hard to think about positional factors; but they are still there. In this case the weakest square in the vicinity of the white king is not h2, although that is the least defended square, because we also need to take into account the potential of the attacking pieces. Here only the black queen can reasonably reach h2. On the other hand, all of the black pieces can attack the g2-square, and on top of this the bishop on d4 is tying White down and eliminating the planned defence along the second rank. Black managed to exploit this quite beautifully in the game. l..Jfc6!! Chapter 1 - Weaknesses 43
[diagram]
The weakness of the g2-square suddenly becomes very pressing. Black is threatening ...Ne3.
2.Qg5
2.Qxe2 £}h4! with mate on the way, is the
nice point to Black's combination.
2...*g7
0-1 There was actually a less natural but equally good way of winning the game. I...Qb7!! would have the same main point and threats, but after 2.Qg5 an additional way to win the game exists:
[diagram]
2.. Jbcf2t 3.Sxf2 Qblf Black exploits that the
rook on a2 is unprotected. Although spectacular, this example was not conceptually challenging in any way. The next one is a bit more complex. Ivan Cheparinov - Stelios Halkias Helsingor 2012
[diagram]
While it may not be realistic to expect White's attack to be successful against the best defence, it is possible to use the weakness of the h7-pawn (only defended by the king, who does not really count) and the long-term weakness of the a7-pawn to create serious threats. In the game White focused exclusively on the queenside and had only a modest advantage:
32 J.c6?!± Nh8 33.Rh5 Qb4 34.Q6 Nd7
35Jfe6 Nfi> 36.Rd8 h6 37.Rxf8f Qxf8
38.Qd6 W£7 39.Rd2 Se7 40.Qd8t *h7
4l.Qd3t Vl-Vl The correct continuation, on the basis of the weaknesses mentioned, would have been:
32.!c2!
This would have created the strong threat of
33.Qc4t Ng8 34.Qh4 h6 35.Sd8.
[diagram]
White is winning on account of 35...Sc8
36.Rxf8 Rxf8 37.Qe7! Qc8 38.Sd6! and
there is no defence against 5=?xh6.
32.1b 1?! is a weaker version of this idea, as
there will be checks on el to look out for, as well as the knight coming to c3. The bishop is simply not well placed here.
32...Qe8
An undesirable move, but unfortunately also the only move.

So remember to take notice of the weakness of your own and the opponents kings position. Creating weaknesses Accountancy - this is what a friend of mine calls a certain style of chess, one to which he subscribes personally. What he specifically likes to do is to create and fix weaknesses in his opponents' positions, manoeuvre around a bit, and eventually win something. We do not have to play like this of course, but it makes lots of sense to create a weakness and then exploit it later on. Here are two examples of the creation of weaknesses. Magnus Carlsen - Boris Gelfand Moscow 2006
[diagram]
12..Jfd5!
This creates a weakness on the dark squares in the constellation f2/e3/d4. While this is by no means decisive, it still causes problems that White must pay attention to for a long time.
13.6 Qa5 I4.Bg2 c5!
Black puts extra pressure on the weakened dark squares.
15.dxc5 16.O-O O-O
Chapter 1 - Weaknesses 45 Black was slightly better and won the game on move 38. In the next example it is clear that White is better, but he can improve his position considerably by weakening the opponent's structure. Ruslan Ponomariov - Viktor Korchnoi Donetsk (3) 2001
[diagram]
White has a fine position with a good knight against a very bad bishop, though it is not obvious that this is enough to win. With his next move he provokes a weakening in the black king's position that soon leads to further problems for Black. Although the attack may not be decisive, it will demand much of Black's attention, meaning that he will find it difficult to defend other aspects of his position, such as the queenside. 27Jfd4!
27.Nd4 Hf6 28.Qd2± is less clear.
27...g6
A painful move to play, but what else should Black do? After 27..Jkg6? 28.Nh4 it is already time to consider resignation. And after 27.. J,e6 28.Sel Re8 29.a3± Black is in a bad way.
28 Jfd2 Se8 29.Nd4 Sfe5
The most active move. After both 29...Rh5
30.Scl± and 29...Sf6 30.Scl±, White would
be able to put pressure on the queenside more or less undisturbed. 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1
30.f4!
White is able to exploit the weakening of the black kingside with this pawn advance.
30...5e4 31.6 Nh8

32Jfh6Qe7 The only move; 32...Sg8 33.Nf3! and White wins.
33.&B Sfffi 34Jfg5 Qg7 35.f6?!
This succeeds in the long term, but in the shorter term it blocks the open files that White is attacking along. 35.fxg6 jbcg6 (35...Qxg6
36.Qcl! and White wins material) 36.@xd5
Qxb2 37.Qxd6± with an extra pawn was stronger.
35..JNB 36.Scl H6 37Jfd2 g5?
A decent idea, wanting to prepare ...Ui5, but played at the wrong time.

Black should prefer 37...Se2 38.Qd3 R2e3
39.Qa6 g5±, with ideas such as 40.Qxa5 JUi5.

40...Sxfi6 4l.hxg5 Sg6

1-0 Fixing weaknesses Usually when we talk about fixing weaknesses, it refers to a situation like this:
[diagram]
White moves the a-pawn to a5, in order to fix the weakness on b7 and create a long-term issue with the a6-pawn as well. In the following example, the weakness is fixed through constant pressure on it, and then devoured! Boris Spassky - Jan Hein Donner Leiden 1970
[diagram]
Black has a weak pawn on e6, but at the moment it seems that it can be protected without any significant concessions. However, the weakness is all the way down the a2- g8 diagonal and White can make use of this by transferring his bishop. As a result, Black will find it very difficult to ever get rid of the weakness.
21.&fl!±
The bishop is strong at h3, but on c4 it has the potential to be deadly.
21...Sd6
Black could have tried 21...<^>h8 22.jLc4 Qd7 23.Qe3 He8, which would have solved one big problem. But White would get free rein to advance his pawns on the kingside and probably win the game in a brutal attack. Chapter 1 - Weaknesses 47
21...a5!? would make some sense, planning to
advance his pawns and at the same time kick the white bishop. However, after 22.jk.c4 b5
23.1d3 Rac8 24.&bl±, Blacks position has
not really been improved by the advance of the pawns on the queenside.
22.1c4 Bad8?!
22...f5 was better, but White has a serious
advantage anyway.
23.6 Sxd4
This loses by force, but by this stage probably everything does.
23...b5 would be an attempt to avoid Qa3
tricks: 24.Nb3 Be8 (24...Rxd4 25.Sxd4 Rxd4 26.Sxe6! ^h8 27.Sd6 and White wins material) 25.fxe6 Nxe6 26.d5 This break in the centre wins. 26...cxd5 27.Sxd5 Sb6
28.Rd2 There is no defence against Sde2 and
Qd5, winning the knight.
23...8.8 24.Qa3! and White wins.
After 25.Qa3! Black loses something.
25.Sxdl Sxdlf 26.Qxdl
Donner resigned, realizing that 26...Qe7 is met conclusively with:

1. Salov- Karpov
Alma-Ata blitz (1) 1995
[diagram]
This position is of course essentially equal, but quite often equal positions are won with good moves, so it is important to play the best moves for Black. Here the only reason why White should have any problems is that the b2-pawn is a bit weak, and that he has advanced the a-pawn. Were the a-pawn on a2, Black would not have the chance to make the advances he did in the game.
16...Sfb8!
The correct rook, as the other rook needs to keep an eye on the a-pawn.
17.Sael
17.c4 will lead to a knight being established
on d5 once Black deflects the c4-pawn. White might have a temporary initiative, but long term the d5-square will mean that the position is a bit more pleasant for Black.
17...a6! On the next move comes 18...b5!,
and although the position is not terribly frightening for White, it is certainly not entirely equal.
17...d5?! would be risky. White suddenly
has three pieces attacking on the kingside. After 18.^e5 Qe8 19.Hg4! Black has to play non-script moves such as 19...f6!?, when the position is simply unclear.
17.^el! as suggested by Andrew Greet was
probably the most prudent move. White manoeuvres the knight to d3 in order to keep all his pieces covered. In this case White probably holds equality without too much trouble.

...0-1
2. Pogonina - E. Paehtz
Krasnoturinsk 2007
[diagram]
White has a pleasant position after various decent moves, but the clearest plan by far is to transfer a knight to the weak e6-square. This is what White did in the game.
21.Nb5! g5
21...Sfe8 22.^bd4 Qf7 has the idea of
replying to 23.£"e6 with 23...^c5!, when Black would be okay, but it can be met with either Chapter 1 - Weaknesses 53 the greedy 23.Qxa5!? or the more restrained
23.b4, in each case with a great advantage.
22.&bd4 Qg6 23.£}e6
We could actually stop here. When you play positional chess, you do not have to be able to see anything beyond transferring the ineffective knight from c3 to e6. White has many ways to follow up, with some probably better than others, but it is not something we gain a practical advantage out of determining in advance.
23...Bf7 24.Qxa5?
This move looks very tempting, but it allows Black to come back into the game with counterplay on the kingside. The correct way to play was to make the most out of the remaining inactive pieces. After 24.Hbel! White's advantage is very clear. 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 It has to be the b 1 -rook, as it was under threat from the queen, and so moving the other rook would deny White the option of doubling on the e-file. If Black plays 24...^c5, the knight can be exchanged and then the rook enters the position on e6 with a clear superiority. And if Black plays 24...g4 White can play 25.hxg4 Sxg4 26.Se4! with Sfel on the way. The black position is full of weaknesses and White's dominating pieces will secure her a clear edge in all lines. In the game, matters were less clear.
[diagram]
24...g4 25.hxg4 Qxg4
The g-file is opened and the position is not as clear as it once was. 26Jfel! The queen is urgently needed on the kingside. The computer thinks White also can win with
26.b4?!, with the idea that 26...^h8 27.b5
Sg8 28.bxa6 jkd4 29.Qel f3 allows White to play 30.Qd2!. This is a very complicated line, and an example of a machine not being able to do a human's job. After 30...^,e5! Black has enough counterplay and it is White who has to look for a draw: 31.g3 bxa6 32.4}xf3 Qxf3
33.^d4 Rxg3t 34.fxg3 Qxg3t 35.Qg2 jkxd4t
36.&hlQh4t 37.Qh2 Qe4t=
26.Qb5?! is another computer favourite.
It takes a human to discover the correct riposte: 26...<^>h8! 27.Qxb7 Hg8 Black has some counterplay here. The critical line starts
28.Qh2! (28.Qxa6? Bd4! and White is mated)
28...Qg6 29.Qb3 f3! 30.g3 ^c5 31.5^xc5
kd4\ 32.^hl Bxf2! 33.g4 Bxc5 34.Qc3t Nh7
35.Hbel f2 with chances for both sides.
26...6.8?
Black misses her opponent's defensive resource. 26...£\c5! was much better, and after 27.^xc5 dxc5 28.b4! cxb4 29.axb4 Rf6
30.Qe4 Sg6 Black has a lot of counterplay.
I would guess that White is still minimally better with correct play, but it is definitely easier to play the black position, making the result rather unpredictable.
27.Qdl! Sg8 28.Nfg5! 29.Nxf7t Qxf7
30JTB
And White won.

White's weaknesses are h3 and e4. Black can organize an attack on both of these quite easily. The thing to look out for is how to increase the pressure on the white position without giving White any counterplay.
28..Jfd7!
The obvious first move. White only has one reply.
29.g4 h5!
This is the key move. The white pawns are put under increased pressure as the pawn joins in the attack. The common mistake here is to think that Black has a decisive double attack with
29...Qd3?!, but actually, because of the slightly
exposed nature of the rook on d8, White can repulse the attack with 30.Se3!. It should be said that 29...^e6!?+ would also give Black a great game.
30.Ne3
White can also call in reinforcements from his own pawn base, but it would weaken the king's position on the second rank, which can be seen from the line: 30.f3 Qd3! 31.Se3 Qc2f with a winning attack.
30.Ng3 would lose to 30...Qd3t 31.Be3 Qdl!
with a decisive attack.

30..Jfd3!
The e-pawn falls with check. The game is decided.

Budapest rapid (4) 2000
[diagram]
Chapter 1 - Weaknesses 55
18.Ne4!
This move is the best for two reasons, and should thus be relatively easy to find. First of all it prevents Black from playing 18...e4 and activating the black bishop on f6. Secondly, it exchanges the knight on c5, giving White the advantage of good knight against somewhat inactive bishop. There is of course a lot of play in the position, but this still secures a slight plus.
18...6xe4
After this normal-looking move Black is entirely without counterplay. However, it is not easy to cook up something better. Maybe it was necessary to play 18..."S,e7, when White is still happy after 19.g4±, but his queen is not nearly as dominant as in the game.
19.@xe4
White is ready for g2-g4-g5; Black has no counterplay.
19...g6
19...h5 20.Rhgl! would give White a strong
initiative on the kingside.
[diagram]
20.g4
This move does not make a lot of sense to me. It seems more natural to play 20.h5± and keep the future of the g-pawn open.
20...Jtg7 21.H5 22.hxg6 hxg6 23.Nd2±
White could have tried a lot of other moves here, but nothing was really clear-cut.
[diagram]
23...c6?
White's only problem is the d-pawn. Exchanging it does not open a file for attack against the white king, it merely exchanges this weakness.
23...Qxf2? would allow White to start a
winning attack with 24.Rdfl, and then: a) 24...Qg3 is somewhat complicated, but clear enough once you see the idea: 25.^c4!! Sad8 26.£k3 and the threat of 2f3 is devastating. Black can try 26...Bd6 27.Rf3 f5!?, but it is not enough. 28.^xf5! gxf5 (28...@g2
29.Ng3! with Sf8f coming.) 29.Qxf5 and the
queen is lost. b) 24...Qc5 25.Qf3! Qe7 26.Ne4 Sed8 (26...^fS 27.Rh7! followed by Qh3 is equally decisive) 27.Qh3 and Black cannot survive. For example: 27...Rxd5 28.Qh7t ^f8 29.g5 Sd6 30.Nf6 Sxf6 31.gxf6 lxf6 32.Sxf6! Qxf6
33.Qh8t Qxh8 34.Sxh8t Ne7 35.Sxa8 and
the ending is won.
23...Rad8!± was natural and sensible. White
plays something like 24.f3 and prepares to put the knight on e4 with a slight but enduring edge.
24.dxc6 Sac8 25.6 Sxc6 26.Re2 Qe6

5. Leko - Morozevich
Wijk aan Zee 2001
[diagram]
White's pieces are basically placed as he would like them to be. Both players have unsafe kings, but that cannot be exploited immediately.
29.h4!±
White's only asset is his potential passed pawn. In order for it to have any value, it must be pushed immediately. The alternatives do not offer White any advantage. 29.Qd6 Sd8 30.Qe5 O-O gives White little. Black is ready to play ...Qf2 or ...Bfe8. White can of course force a draw, but nothing more is available.
29.Qe5 can again be answered with castling,
but it is also possible to play 29...Nd7!?, when the black king looks safe as houses in the middle.
29.Rel can also be answered with a king
move, or 29...O-O!?, as White has no particular compensation after 30.Rxe6 fxe6 31.Sxg6f <Nf7.
29...5a8
29...Nd7!? 30.h5 Sbg8± looks a more natural
defence, but Black is still on the defensive.
30.h5 ffa7 31.a4
31.Hd2!?± was also possible.
31...gxh5
This looks like a concession. The g-file is a great asset for White. On the other hand, Black wins a tempo.

6. Horn - Howell
Stockholm 2006
[diagram]
Whites centre looks great, but it is not stable. Black can with a few good moves create some attractive squares for his pieces. One of the surprises to some is that Black does not have to worry too much about the safety of his king in this position. The way the white bishops are pointing, they are a danger to no one. The essence of the position is the way White is clinging on to the light squares, only supporting those in the centre with the knight on c3. It is for this reason that Black can undermine the centre.
11...S! 12.e5?
This is very compliant. Black now has three pieces that are thriving, while the bishop on g7 is not significantly worse than the bishop on e3, and despite everything has a long-term future.
12.d5! was a natural move. White is fighting
for the light squares as well. 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 After 12...fxe4 White can either choose the calm line with 13.dxe6 exf3 I4.exd7t Qxd7 15.Jbcf3 ibd\3 16.Sxf3 O-O with more or less even chances, or he can try the more aggressive 13.^d4!? Nxd5 I4.^xd5 Jbcd5
15.f5!?. However, I think Black is not worse
after 15...O-O, although nothing is certain, of course.
12...6b6 13.b3
I find it difficult to suggest a plan for White here. Black is very solid and the white pieces are poor, yet not easy to improve.
13...Qd7 I4.a4 b4 15.Na2 a5 I6.c3 bxc3
17.Nxc3 7 18.Nb5 &ed5+
Black is better and won on move 54.

7. Kramnik - Carlsen
Dortmund 2007
[diagram]
This is an example of opening preparation gone completely wrong. Carlsen must have thought that he was in time to challenge the bind on the black position created by the pawn on d4, before the weakness of the c6- square and the problems with the backward pawn started to emerge. Kramnik must have wanted his knight on d2 to do something. Both his rooks are inactive, but they cannot assist in the fight for c6 easily. So, once again, the solution is to play the piece which is prime for improvement towards the weakness.
17.Nb3!
The computer points out that there is a more tactical solution to the position. White is also much better after 17.e4!? ftb6 18.ftb3! axb4 19.axb4±, based on the following tactical point: 19...ibcb4 20.Sa7 Jka8 21.Sxa8! Bxa8
22.^c6 and the bishop is lost as well. This
is objectively neither better nor worse than Kramnik's solution, but I have to say that I like the clarity of Kramnik's play more.
17...axb4 18.Na5 Jla8 19.£\ac6 M,xc6
After this move, all hope is gone. Black should not exchange this bishop, after which he is forced to accept a bad bishop versus good knight position. Instead he should have hoped that the bishop on a8, however ineffectual it is at the moment, could one day make something of itself.

8. Adams - Cheparinov
Baku 2008
[diagram]
Black's weaknesses are all on the kingside. As the centre is very stable there is plenty of time for White to start a kingside attack.
32.h4! d5
This loses by force, but the position is not tenable.
32...h5
This weakens the kingside. Among other possibilities, White might consider the following direct approach:
33.g4! hxg4 34.h5! gxh5 35.Qg5t ^f8
36.Qh6t!
An important check. If the king goes to g8, White takes time to take on h5, planning further attacks on the black king. The critical line is thus:
36...6.7 37.1ff6t Nd7
37.38.Rd5! is a neat finish. After
38...Qxe3 39.fxe3 exd5 40.exd6 ^g8 4l.d7
White wins.
38 Jfxf7t Se7 39.Qxh5
White should win this position, where he will soon be a pawn up with a great attack.
32...Qc7 33.h5 Qd8 looks like it should be the
best defence.
[diagram]
But after 34.Qf3!, preventing ...d5 and continuing to set up an attacking position, Black is not going to survive anyway.

9. Adams - Koneru

The great weakness in the black position is the c6-square, which White would love to dominate. For this reason the knight belongs on a5. It is actually no more difficult than that in this case.

11. Grebionkin - Kirusha
St Petersburg 2001
[diagram]
White has achieved quite a promising position from the opening and could even consider sacrificing the exchange with 16.Jbcd5 Jlh3 17.^xc6 bxc6 18.Sxc6 ibcfl 19-^xfl. However, I do not think Black would be too unhappy about this turn of events, as he has rid himself of his weaknesses, and has some chances of proving that the exchange is more important than the two pawns. Another interesting move is 16.Bel, simply defending the e2-pawn and stepping out of the ...JUi3 shot. But here I am not so sure about the consequences of dynamic play with
16...@e7!?, intending to meet 17.Jbcd5 with
17...5ad8, when the position has become a
bit more complicated than I would like. It is possible that this is objectively as strong as the game continuation (although I doubt it), but from a practical point of view, it definitely makes less sense. The correct move was played by Grebionkin.
16.Sc5!
The attack on d5 with the rook forces Black to clarify his position in the centre. Chapter 1 - Weaknesses 61 l6..Jfe7!? Black gives up a pawn in the hope that he will get some activity. If Black plays simple chess, such as 16...ibcd4 17Jbcd4 Ne6 18.e3 or 16...^xd4 17Jtxd4 kc6 18.e3, then White has a clear edge, with a permanent target on d5. With the exchange of a pair of minor pieces, the activity of the black position has disappeared. Black could try the sneaky 16...^,e6!?. White does not have any clear way to put Black away, but the position after 17.£^xc6 bxc6 18.Bxc6 ibtb2 19.Qd3, with ideas such as Sa6, Sdl or Rc5, is still very uncomfortable for Black.
17.Sxd5 Bxd4

[diagram]
2lJbtc6! bxc6 22.b4 White should be winning here. The extra pawn and the brilliant position of the bishop on c5 are enough to win. It is true that opposite-coloured bishops can be a strong drawing factor, but in certain positions, such as this one, they can actually make matters worse. The fact that White did not win the game is down to poor technique, or perhaps simply a bad day.

13. Hess - Postny
Ningbo 2011
[diagram]
Black has two sets of weaknesses: the f7/e6 pawn constellation and his king, which is being threatened by the advancing white pawns. The weakness in the white camp is obviously the d-pawn, which would be apparent after
27.bxc6?! Rxd4! with an unclear position.
Putting these facts together, it is not difficult to come up with the strong move Hess played in the game. Chapter 1 - Weaknesses 63
27.d5! Nb8?!
This just loses, but Black's position is poor in any case.
27...cxd5?! 28.cxd5 Nb8 is not really different.
(28...Sxd5 29.Sac 1 Sxd3 is obviously good for White if he takes the queen, but even stronger is 30.Sxe6! with a direct win.) 29.Sac 1 Taking the pawn on e6 next will lead to a winning endgame.
27...g4? 28.Qh4 and White wins.
27...ftg6! was the only move. Black is still
under great pressure, but at least he does not lose directly. Probably White is best off playing
28.bxc6 g4 29.Qh2 bxc6 and now either
30.Nb4 or 30.Sabi with great pressure on the
black position.
28.dxe6! Sxd3 29.exf7 Sgd8 30.Qe6

14. Tomashevsky - Svidler
Moscow 2007
[diagram]
Black has a weakness on d5 and is under pressure on f7. At the same time Black is not really able to put pressure on e3, where the bad bishop is defending a good pawn, as Suba would say. The main reason for this is of course that Black's minor pieces are rather out of play. White is able to increase his advantage by putting further pressure on the black position and creating an additional weakness.
26.a4!
After both 26.Qa3 Se6!± and 26.Scl Se6
27.a4 Sb7± Black is of course worse, but his
position can still be defended.
26...bxa4
A sad decision, but it was very difficult to find the only chance available to Black:
26...ffb8 27.axb5 axb5 28.Scl Sb7!
28...5e6 is met with 29.ftc5 ikxc5 30.Sxc5
and White wins a pawn.
29.Sc5! Qc8!
29...b4 30.Qa4 and Black will soon lose the
b4-pawn. Against this tactically-based defence, White can play 30.Sc3 with a solid advantage, or enter the tactics with:
30.Sxb5!? Sxd4! 31.fcb4! Rc4 32.Sxd5 Sc5
33.Sxd7 Qxd7 34.Qd3
Where White has an extra pawn, but the technical job is quite complicated. After 26...Na5? White has a simple but attractive combination: 27.Jbca5 @xa5
28.Rxf7! (28.Ne5! is more human, and also
wins.) 28...Hxf7 29.Sxf7 Nxf7 30.Qxd5t Se6 31.Qe5t! and White wins on account of
31...Nf6 32.Qf3t with mate to follow.

Black cannot avoid losing material, the a6- pawn being most likely to fall.

15. Nakamura - Sasikiran

Nakamura missed his chance when he played 23.g4?!± and later on lost in 87 moves. Instead White had the chance to exploit the X-ray from d4-g7 and the pressure down the d- and e-files with:
23.e5! dxe5
23...^h5 24.g4 and White wins material.
24.Ba7t!
It is quite often good to either push the king into the corner or create an entry point on a7 for the queen
24...Na8 25.±c5
White wins the exchange and would probably have won the game as well. Chapter 1 - Weaknesses 65
16. Lysyj - Wells
Plovdiv 2008
[diagram]
The weakness of the c6-square is the dominant feature of this position. If Black had time to play ...c7-c5 he would be absolutely okay, but by reacting quickly White can condemn him to passivity.
18.Bb5!
This is the best way to exploit the weakness. The queen is a poorer blockader and after
1 SMc6 a6! it is not so easy for White to improve
his position. Black will continue with ...^hS and ...Bg8 in order to get White to declare his intentions. White still has compensation for the pawn, but Black is starting to free himself and should not be significantly worse, if at all. A point worth noticing is 19.Qg2 g6 20.e4 c5!, when the white centre is being undermined. This is what can happen if Black is given the space he would like. Here White has to enter terrible complications with 21.jbce6! fxe6
22.Rxg6t, which should end in a draw with
best play.
18...Bg6
It is difficult for Black to find a move. A tactical point is that 18...c5? loses instantly to 19.ibtd7 Qxd7 20.ibd:6.
18...Qc8 19.Jb:6 a6 is met with 20.e4! and
White dominates. Obviously winning the exchange is less attractive than keeping control. 19Jk,c6 a6 20.e4 This is an even worse version for Black than after 18...Qc8. White is just winning.
20...b5
[diagram]
21.Qdl?
This natural move throws away a lot of the advantage. After 21.Qb3! Black does not have any defence against e4-e5. For example
21...Qc8 22.e5 ^h5 23.Rxg6! and after
23...fxg6 24Jfxe6t Sf7 25.^d5 White
eventually wins material.
21.. Jfc8! 22.W6?!
It was time for White to cash in his advantage and take the exchange. Now Black develops counterplay; but probably Pete was already in serious time trouble.
22...5.8 23.e5 Nh5 24.Sg4 b4?
24...Qe8! is a very difficult move to find.
Black wants to play ...b5-b4, but has to prevent the h4-bishop from joining the game via e7. Had Black played this, he would have been more or less okay.
25.axb4 Hb6
25...5.b4 26.jk.e7 is hopeless. Probably
Black only now realized that after 26...Rxb2 White wins with 27.ibcd7 Qxd7 28.jbcf8 ^xfS 29.Sxg6.
26.O-O-O?
26.J,e7 Se8 27 Jkc5 and White wins.
26...Nb8?
26...Qe8! would have equalized here too.
27.1e4! Sxb4
27...Qe8 comes too late now. White wins
after 28.Rdgl Nc6 29.Qh3! with serious threats to the black king.

17. Kramnik - Leko
Brissago (14) 2004
[diagram]
In the long term White will have no advantage on the kingside. Black will play ...g6, after which his structure cannot be penetrated easily - the f7-pawn is too easy to defend. All of Whites advantage is therefore on the queenside.
21.b4!
The weakness is the c7-square, and White needs to get his rook in there in order to attack all the other weaknesses on the 7th rank.
21...a6 22.a4 Nd8?
22...jbca4 23.Sc7 favours White. He will
win back the pawn immediately. For example:

[diagram]
Black to play Black can probably equalize by exchanging weaknesses, but he seeks a long game, where the d4-pawn might be a bit more exposed than the pawn on c6. How should he play in order to get the most out of his pieces? If pawns are the skeleton of a position, or "the soul of the game", then the pieces must be the flesh and blood, with the king being the heart and brains of the operation. Yet how well do most chess players really know their pieces? And how well do they treat them? Pieces certainly work like bees for the sake of the hive, but they are not workers like the pawns; staying with the terminology of the beehive, they are the drones. I personally like to think of the dynamics in a position as being a measurable quantity, where a piece can have a rather low value if it is poorly placed, while it can have quite a high value if it is excellently placed. Likewise, a piece can have low or high potential, based on the pawn structure and other factors. No doubt computer programmers work hard at refining these evaluations, though my limited knowledge suggests that they are at least equally interested in making the most out of the extra cores our computers are starting to have. The worst-placed piece While a programmer has to work out a quantifiable value to attribute to the pieces, in order to communicate with the machine, the human brain works in a more intuitive way. Looking at our pieces, it should not be too difficult to work out which of our pieces is worst placed. Ideal squares In Excelling at Chess, I introduced the idea of Looking for ideal squares for our pieces. Here we are not talking about their current dynamic value, but about their potential value. At times a poorly-placed piece will not have an obvious ideal square. The piece can be said to have low potential, at least for the time being. But at other times the ideal square can be quite attractive, although quite far away. As one of my three questions is "Which is the worst-placed piece?", the concept of ideal squares is certainly an important one to assimilate (and the way we do this is by paying attention to it again and again in training, or when we feel lost during a game). Here is a simple example of looking for the worst-placed piece and manoeuvring it to a decent square. Alexander Vaulin - Eduard Prandstetter Pardubice 1996
[diagram]
It is quite obvious to me that the bishop on c8 is the worst-placed piece; it is not only devoid of any positive function, it is also in the way of the rook on a8! The ideal square for the bishop is in my opinion e4. Prandstetter clearly agreed with me, as he decided to manoeuvre it there.
17..JU7
White is in a similar situation, looking at his pieces and trying to find out which ones should be performing much better. At the moment the knight on c2 looks more active Chapter 2 - Pieces 73 than the rook on al, but it is an illusion. The rook on al is only one move away from a good square (fl), while the knight is painfully far from a good square. As nothing concrete is happening at the moment, Vaulin decided to put his knight on its ideal square.
18.£el ±e8 19.Nd3 !g6 20.Ne5 kc4
Both players have achieved their aim and the position can be said to be in balance.
21.Sf4 Jlxg2 22.Nxg2 $Sd7
Black decides to neutralize the strong white knight instead of having a strong knight of his own. Maybe this is slightly inaccurate, but in practice it does not make a great deal of difference. Most natural to me would have been 22...g5!?
23.Sf3 Qe4 24.Safi Sxf3 25.Sxf3 Sffi and the
position is completely level.
23.5}xd7 Qxd7 24.Safl Sxf4 25.Sxf4
The only consequence of having played
22...ftd7 is that Black has to find the correct
plan here. If White were given the chance to play e3-e4 he would have a slight edge. However, Black is focused and creates a good square for his queen on d5:
25...dxc4! 26.bxc4 b5! 27.Qb3

V2-V2
This example of a bad bishop becoming good is of course very simple. Most people would have played this manoeuvre without thinking; if nothing else then because that is what you are supposed to do in the Stonewall. But the bishop manoeuvre makes sense also in more complicated scenarios, still based on the principle of putting the worst-placed piece on the ideal square. The following game is far from flawless, which just shows how difficult chess is, but Black's positional ideas are quite clear and powerful, when faced with an inconsequent opponent. Mikhail Kozakov - Zlatko Topalovic Varazdin 2003
[diagram]
In this position it looks natural to put a rook on c8, and maybe to repel the white knight from its advanced position on b5 with ...fta7 at some point - White then replies ftc3 and Black probably returns his knight to c6, inviting a draw. But the question is what this actually does to help Black with his real problem, which is what to do with his bishops and rooks. In the game Topalovic decided on a more active plan, which proved successful in practice. Whether it is stronger is hard to say, but it certainly makes a lot of sense.
17...16!?
This move has two purposes. First of all it aims to open the f-file (or at least to have this possibility available). But it is the second option which is really attractive: the inactive bishop on d7, which has little prospect of coming alive by being the key player behind a ...b5-break, is offered a route to freedom. The downside to playing ...f6 is the weakening of the e6-square. White should definitely have tried to use this more forcefully than he did in the game. The outcome would then have been significantly in doubt.
18.Qd2
It is always worth considering whether White should take on f6. Black can consider taking back with the rook (most natural) or with the g-pawn (somewhat risky in my opinion). In general, White plays this phase of the game as if he has no idea what the function of his pieces should be.
18...1e8 19.Sacl
[diagram]
Chapter 2 - Pieces 75
19...1g6?!
Black gives the impression of thinking that White will not do anything active - and he is right. I have the feeling that sometimes there are signs in our body language that are picked up subconsciously by our opponents and which help determine the direction of the game. If a player feels indecisive and uncertain, he will pass this impression on to his opponent, who will then naturally be more confident. This can in turn lead to increased uncertainty for the first player. (If you want to turn this into something more than pop psychology, the advice would be to be confident at the board and hope that this gives you a small extra edge. Obviously, if your moves are bad, this may not do you much good!)
19...fxe5! seems more accurate. After 20.fxe5
kg6 Black has fully equalized.
20.&el?!
This passive move is hopefully better explained by my dodgy psychology than by Kozakov's understanding of chess. The intention is to attack the e6-pawn, but very little is achieved by this; and in turn the knight is poorly placed on el.
20.exf6!
This was the correct move.

Black should play 20...gxf6 21.Qe3 "S,e4 followed by ...f5, with perhaps a slightly inferior position. Otherwise he could quickly find himself in a worse situation:

[diagram]
White is rather passive. After 23.,fi,e2 Sf8 it is very hard to arrange to play Jkg4 while the knight is poorly placed on el, weakening the first rank (allowing mate, for example).
21.!g4?
It was the last chance for 21.exf6!, when White would still not be worse.
21...6
Having established the bishop on e4, it is quite natural to fix the pawns on light squares behind it. The only possible objection is that there was another interesting possibility here, which may be even stronger.
21...fxe5! was attractive; after all, the pin down
the f-file means that the pawn is hanging. White would probably have to play something along the lines of 22.jbce6t Nh8 23.dxe5 £}xe5?.
22.ile2
8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 At this point Black clearly looked for a way to bring the rooks into the game. The most natural way is to play on the side of the board where he is stronger, which is the kingside. However, this entails weakening the king and should not really work against the best defence. But with an opponent who is
[diagram]
simply waiting for you to advance, we often see that the strongest continuation is to play as aggressively as possible.
22...5f7!?
22..Aa7 23.^c3 Rac8T was more standard,

23.Sc3!
The rook is well placed here, looking towards both sides of the board.
23...6h8
8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1
24.h3?
This is a horrible move in many ways. First of all it does very little for the white position; you can only surmise that White may have thought he would have to play ^hl-h2 soon. One better option was to carry out a little prophylaxis against Blacks plan with 24.5}f3 h6 25.Sfcl, when Black is prevented from playing ...g5 and the white pieces are back in the game. The tactical point behind these moves is that 25...Sg8?? is punished with
26.?}g5!, when Black is in deep trouble. But
if Black does not commit suicide then the position is just equal.
[diagram]
Chapter 2 - Pieces 77
24.^d3! was possibly even stronger. The
knight is going to c5, exploiting that the d4- pawn is immune because of Qe3 tricks. The board catches fire after: 24...g5 25.5^c5 gxf4
26.^xe6 Nxe5, when I assess the complications
as leading to a strange form of balance.
24...Sg8
White is no longer able to stop ...g5 and his position must be worse. But this does not justify his reaction, where he eliminates the e4-bishop with devastating structural consequences. "Lost for moves" are the words that spring to mind.

But games are won by the player with the best plan and the best moves, not by the analyst. By first putting his bishop on the best possible square and then launching an attack, Black won the game. White had the chance to fight against these ideas all the way, but failed to do so. We refer him to the chapter on prophylaxis. Let us have a look at a different manoeuvre, this time with the author on the receiving end. Daniel V. Pedersen - Jacob Aagaard Denmark 2012

Somehow I had messed up the opening horribly. Basically I had been daydreaming rather than thinking.

V2-V2
The final example in this section could have been solved if I had only paid attention to my worst-placed piece. However, I did not think along those lines at all. Jacob Aagaard - David Isonzo Arco 2005
[diagram]
Black is threatening the e4-pawn, but White should protect it in a way that makes sense. As Black's active options are ...d5 and ...f5, the white bishop is ideally placed on the passive looking f3-square. Another classic case of a bad bishop defending good pawns (Suba). The difference from a truly bad bishop is that this one has prospects, while a really bad bishop would have none.
20.16!
20.f3? would allow Black to play 20..Jkh6!
with almost immediate equality.
20.Qd3?! would allow Black to play 20...Sfd8.
A key idea is 21.J,f3 d5 22.exd5 Qxb4, when Black is in the game. And after 21.!Rc7 d5 22.Rxb7 d4 23.J,d2 Sab8 Black has some counter-chances, though White is still better because of his passed pawn on the queenside. Chapter 2 - Pieces 79
20...Sfd8
20...jUi6? would now drop a piece to 21.g3!.
21.Bc7 Sab8
[diagram]
This is the critical position (in the sense that I got it wrong!). Basically Whites poorly- placed piece is the rook on fl. My main cop¬ out is that I was a considerably weaker player back then and did not pay as much attention to my poorly-placed pieces as I should have. Even in my notes to the game in my private files, I do not pay any special attention to the inactive rook. The correct continuation was therefore: 22jfd2! The immediate threat of winning the queen wins valuable time. In the game I played weakly with:
22.g3?! Qf6 23.h4 h6±
[diagram]
This was what I was hoping for, and I assumed that my next move would be really strong. However, it does nothing about bringing my worst-placed piece into the game.
24.h5?
I am not sure if I am going too far when I say that this is a positional blunder. But it is certainly not a good move.
24.Ng2 would still have kept a real
advantage.
24...gxh5!
Somehow I had not considered this natural move. I have to recapture or Black will play ...h4.
25 Jbch5 d5
Black has counterplay. White is maybe a bit better, but there is a lot of work needed to win this game, and it took until move 64 to do so.
22...h6 23.g3!
Prophylaxis against the ...d5-break.
23.Sal?
[diagram]
23...d5! would give Black a lot of unnecessary
counterplay, based on the point that 24.exd5? e4 not only wins back the d-pawn, but also creates a double threat to al and f3. White could struggle on with 25.Qcl+, but it would hardly be fun.
23..Jffc 24.Bg2
[diagram]
The bishop returns to safety, allowing White to follow up with Ral-a7 with a close to decisive advantage. Black will not be able to play ...d5 in a meaningful way, as the ...e5-e4 tricks are gone. Creating squares for the pieces The purpose of pawn play is to a great degree to create good squares and possibilities for our pieces. This is a huge part of chess and something we think about all the time. Chess strategy is very preoccupied with pawn play. Here I just want to give a simple example of how pawn play can benefit the pieces - nothing too fancy. The first example includes a pawn sacrifice, but if we disregard this, we can see that it is really all about finding good squares for the pieces, or in making the most of them in other ways. Boris Gelfand - Tomasz Markowski Polanica Zdroj 1998 l.d4 d6 2.&B 3.c4 g6 4.Nc3 Bg7 5.e4 O-O 6.1e2 Na6 7.O-O e5 8.Sel c6 9.ifl exd4 10.5^xd4 5^g4 11.H3 1=fb6 12.hxg4 Qxd4 13MB Qe5 I4.g5 Qe7 15.Qg3 Nc5 16.Bf4 Ac5 17.Sadl 16 18.gxf6 Sxffc 19Jbce5 Qxe5 20.b4
[diagram]
Black's weakest square is certainly the d6- square, at the moment occupied by a pawn, which in turn is a bit weak. White's worst- placed piece is the knight on c3, which obviously would like to be on e4. On top of this, White is leading in development and would like to use this actively.
20..Jfxg3?!
Markowski is doubling White's pawns and preparing to put his knight on e5. When you look at how the game went, this might seem foolhardy, but it was not at this point that the big mistake occurred. Still, I find it a bit risky. It was quite natural to play 20...Nd7, but White would then have a chance to play
21.Qe3, when after 21...a5 22.b5 Nc5, the
position would be unclear.
21.feg3 Nd7
Naturally, if Black were given an extra move to play 22...Ne5, he would be on top of the world. With the queens gone, it would be no problem moving the king to e7 to defend the d6-pawn and White would have to spend half the game bringing his knight to a decent square. Chapter 2 - Pieces 81
[diagram]
An example of this can be found should White play 22.c5, when Black manages to get all his pieces out with 22...Ne5! 23.cxd6 and then the rook to d8. White is clearly fighting for equality in that case, not having solved his problem with the c3-knight. Faced with this prospect, White has no choice but to sacrifice a pawn:
22.e5!
The pawn is let go so that the knight will have a future.
22...dxe5
22...^xe5? 23.Ne4 would allow White to
win the pawn back without giving up any of his advantages.
23.Ne4 Bf7
Black has to play passively. If he tries to get his pieces out with something like 23...Rf8
24.£\d6 £}f6, then after 25.Sxe5 he has no real
way to deal with the invasion on e7. The game is not lost, but it is certainly unpleasant.
24.c5
Another benefit of the pawn sacrifice is that White has time to activate the bishop. White's advantage would be decisive if he could either win his pawn back or bring the queens back onto the board. But in this slightly simplified position he lacks targets to some degree.

The crucial moment of the game and closely related to our topic. What should Black focus on? Making something of his bishop and rook certainly. In his book Gelfand proposed that Black should play 26...b6, when after 27.Sd6 bxc5 28.bxc5 Nf8 29.Sxc6 Nh7 30.Sd6 Sc8 31.Bd5 Bxd5
32.Sxd5± he quite clearly favours White in the
endgame. This is undeniably better than what was played in the game:
26...Se8??
I am not quite sure what the idea is behind this move, but I am sure that Markowski had one. Unfortunately there is a big downside to this move; White now finds a target to aim for with his active pieces. The correct move is 26...a5!, which challenges the white pawns and makes something out of the rook on a8. The critical line goes like this:
27.b5 cxb5 28.axb5 a4 29.Sfl a3
[diagram]
How should this position be evaluated? I am honestly not certain. White has a strong knight on e4 and bishop on c4, but as said before, he lacks targets. Black on the other hand has managed to get a passed pawn and activate the rook on a8. I have analysed the active 30.Bd5, where Black ends up fine in the following complicated line:
30...Nf8! 31.Nd6 Ne6 32.c6 Nd4!?

33.cxb7 Bxb7 34.Nxb7 Ne2t 35.Nh2 Sk3
36.£k5 Sd8 37.Sd3 £}xd5 38.Rxa3 e4 A draw
is the most likely outcome. So I think White should follow my more human thinking and play 30."i,a2. I find White's position more attractive, but that said, I am not really sure what I am intending to do with it. In a practical game this would no doubt be felt as pressure by the black player, but I am not sure it is anything significant objectively. No matter what, it is clear that this is the way Black should have played.

1-0 In the following game we shall see that creating a square for a piece does not necessarily mean that you have to occupy it. At times the threat of using the square is enough to secure certain advantages, in this case tying down Chapter 2 - Pieces 83 the opponent's pieces to the defence of the c4-square. Lajos Portisch - Jens Kristiansen Skopje (ol) 1972

I6.a4! This strong move fixes the pawn structure on the queenside to White's advantage.
16...b4 17.&bl a5
In general Black would love to play 17...c4, but White has 18.a5! in reply, giving Black no compensation for the pawn whatsoever.
18.&bd2
White has control over the c4-square, but he will not rush to play his knight there and allow exchanges. In the game Black neglects his kingside and White launches an attack there, meaning that he never gets round to occupying the c4-square. Still the usefulness of the square is dominant in many lines, as Black has to defend it vigorously.

Perhaps Black considered ...f5, but this would only leave his position with multiple weaknesses.

1-0 Exchanges Hopefully all readers of this book will know that you should exchange your bad bishop for the opponent's good bishop and that you should focus on which pieces remain after exchanges more than on the ones you exchange. But beyond these basic ideas, exchanges in chess is a theme that deserves Chapter 2 - Pieces 85 a longer investigation than I am able to give it right here. My only angle on this occasion will be related to the worst-placed piece, as I think this is a good way of looking at things. The following game illustrates this nicely. Jacob Aagaard - Enamul Hossain Dresden (ol) 2008 l.e4 c5 2.£}f3 5Bc6 3.d4 cxd4 4.5Bxd4
5.5}c3 e5 6.Ndb5 d6
[diagram]
Preparing for this game I saw that my opponent had played a number of games in long theoretical lines and done well out of them. The prospect of having to find a novelty on move 32 of the Sveshnikov was not appealing to me, so I decided to play a less critical move, which would quickly lead to an independent game. 7&d5 5Bxd5 8.exd5 9.a4 This line is not especially dangerous for Black. The idea is 5^b5-a3-c4-b6, but this rarely happens in practice; and if it does, then only after Black has made great gains on the kingside. On the other hand the move is not bad and White is not worse.
9...Ne7 10.1e2 O-O 11.O-O ftd7 12.Be3 a6
13.Na3
[diagram]
This is the critical position of the game. Black needs to find his path forward. Most of his pieces are not well placed and need to find a function (note that finding a function/future is not necessarily the same as moving!). A good strategy for this position would include a vision for all of the black pieces. This is what you would usually expect from a strong grandmaster.
13...tg5?
If you think too superficially, this is a great- looking move. Black seeks to exchange his bad bishop before developing his queenside. But as you have probably gathered, the problem is not in the first part of this sentence, but in the second part. Beyond the exchange of bishops, Black has no plan for the rest of his pieces, nor any idea of what will happen after the exchange. I was quite pleasantly surprised by this move, as it gives me extra time to expand on the queenside.
13...f5 has been played in a number of games,
with Black starting action on the kingside. This is certainly the right way to play. The bishop is likely to stay on c8 for a very long time, until a good square is available for it. However, it would have a future. As the game goes, there is no function available for the bishop until eventually it is exchanged for Whites bad bishop. I4.1xg5! Apparently this was a novelty, but it is the only move that makes sense. I4.f4?exf4 15.ikxf4He8 16.^c4Bxf4 17.Sxf4 Ne5= was played in Muhren - Kalinitschew, Dieren 2004. I4...Qxg5 15.5^c4 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 Black has not managed to do anything to get the c8-bishop into play and is now faced with an attack on the d6-pawn. Already things are getting more difficult for Black and the right move is no longer easy to find.
15...Qe7?!
Black is playing as if he has achieved something and has all the time in the world, but the contrary is the case. He has no active counterplay and White is progressing rapidly on the queenside. The white knight will land on b6 and the pawns will come rolling forward to support it. The more active 15...^f6! was the right way to play, whether or not it is entirely correct. The
[diagram]
point is I6.Nxd6 Rd8 17.Nxc8 ^xd5!, when in order to keep the advantage, White has to play:

Black resigned without giving me the chance to play 31...Hc8 32.Qxc8!?, when the pawns will win. 1-0 The following game illustrates how we can improve our position by exchanging our most weakly-placed piece, thus staying within the theme of this chapter. Alexander Khalifinan - Judit Polgar Las Vegas (5.1) 1999
[diagram]
Black's king is unsafe, no matter where she decides to put it. This factor causes the computer to wildly overestimate White's advantage, even if he does nothing.
22.h3!=
This excellent move prepares to exchange the strong defender on e6 for the inactive bishop on e2. Black will either have to weaken her kingside further (...fxe6) or the d5-square.
22...O-O
22 ...Ne7 was suggested by Ribli. This changes things greatly and should encourage White to open the queenside immediately to take advantage of the exposed position of the king in the centre: 23.b4! axb4
24.gxb4 b5 (24...Sc7 25.Sdbl and the
b7-pawn seems to be impossible to defend.)
25.Sdbl kdl 26.Qf3 bxc4 27.Bxc4 Black is
struggling to defend her two weaknesses on 17 and h7.
23.%3t
I am not really sure that transferring the queen to h4 improves Whites position. I rather like 23.Bg4 Hfd8 24.Qf3 Ng7
25.Jkxe6 fxe6 26.Sbcl Re7 27.Hc3=, though
in other lines Black is under pressure as well.
23...Nh8 24.Qh4 Re7 25.Bg4 Sg8

26.Sd3!?
Khalifman is deliberately waiting before taking on e6; maybe he can avoid ...fxe6.
26.ibce6 fxe6 27.Sd3 Hcd8± does not seem
too dangerous for Black.
26...Rg5?!
Polgar is dreaming of action on the g-file, when neutralizing the pressure down the d-file should have been her priority. From here on things go downhill.
26...5cd8± was necessary, with the point
27.Hbdl Hxd3 28.Hxd3 Jbcg4 (But not
28...5d8? 29.Sd5!!±, based on 29...Bxd5?
30.Bf5+-.) 29.hxg4 Sg6 and Black seems to
be okay.
28.Sbdl± Ecg8?
Black continues her "attack" on the kingside. Better was 28...Qb6! although Black's position is still extremely shaky.
29.Sd6 Rc8
Black does not have time to take on g2, which exposes the flaws with her strategy:
29...Hxg2t 30.&fl Qe7 31.Sd7 @f8 32.gd8
Rc7 33.Sld7 Qe6 34.Sd6 Qe7 35.S8d7 Rf8
36.Qxf6t and White will win the subsequent
ending.
30.g3&g7 31.Sld5
White is winning no matter what. His domination is total and Black's position is riddled with weaknesses. If Polgar now intended to let the pawn go, I do not know, but it does not increase her chances.

27.1xe6 Rxe6
27...fxe6 28.Sbdl±, with the threat of Rd7,
is highly unpleasant for Black. Chapter 2 - Pieces 89 Sacrifices to improve certain pieces (positional sacrifices) The positional sacrifice is a big theme and requires more than one book to cover it fully. I have already given one example above (Gelfand - Markowski), but I would like to give a few more. If this does not satisfy your hunger, I would refer you to Mihai Suba's book on this theme, Positional Chess Sacrifices. Vadim Milov - Alexander Yermolinsky Las Vegas 2006
[diagram]
ll.e5! A typical pawn sacrifice. White loses a pawn, but the control over the e4-square and the death of the dynamics of the black position are more than worth it. Il...Nxe5?! Black has to accept the sacrifice, as 11...5}g4
12.Bg5! followed by Nb5 would be a disaster.
But maybe Black should have aimed for more murky waters with ll...dxe5!?, when the knight on d7 could become active. For example: 12.jkc2 e4 13.^g5 £^e5 I4.Qe2 £k6! 15."S,e3 e5 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 Black is planning to occupy the d4-square and is not significantly worse.
12.5^xe5 dxe5 13.Qe2 Jtd7 I4.jR,g5!
White is ensuring that he keeps control of the e4-square. I4...Qe8 15.Sadl Bc6 16.b4 a6 17.ilxfi6 Sxffi 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1
18.1e4!±
Another useful exchange, securing the e4-square for the knight. Black's position is somewhat worse objectively, and incredibly hard to defend in practice.

After this passive move Black is pushed over the edge.
27...Qd5 was better, although White keeps

[diagram]
One matter I will not delve too far into in this book is the dynamic exchange of values that takes place when we sacrifice a piece or the exchange. What usually happens is that a structural improvement is exchanged for material investment, as in the following example. Here Kramnik gives up the exchange in order to take control of the c6-square. This time around the sacrifice does not come with any active possibilities, but as the position is fairly closed, it is hard for White to do anything with his rooks and for this reason the game was agreed drawn almost immediately.

Loose pieces drop off I am not going to go deeply into this concept, but just mention it briefly. The phrase was first used in print by John Nunn. The idea is pretty simple - undefended pieces are weaknesses, just as undefended pawns are. Usually we would put this theme under tactics, but we should also remember that basically all positions have some tactical element. So rather than go into a long speech about this, I will show a simple example and ask you to get used to being aware of which pieces are undefended from time to time. Who knows, maybe you will get a chance like the following and not let it pass? Murtal Kazhgaleyev - Yaroslav Zherebukh Cappelle la Grande 2010
[diagram]
In this complicated middlegame position, White played 22.Hd3?, after which the position was unclear and the game was won on move 39 by Black. Usually we would put a position like this in a book on tactics or calculation (candidate moves), but it illustrates our example quite well. Because of the undefended nature of the bishop on b7 and the pawn on h7, White could have taken a big step towards winning the game with a nice little tactic:
22.Qe4!
As the queen is immune, Black has to defend the bishop on b7, allowing White to take on h7 with a decisive advantage. Final note - a practical example The key thing I want you to take away from this chapter is the power of the question: "Which is the worst-placed piece?" Even with such a simplistic tool you can play quite reasonable chess. Here is a recent example from one of my own games. My opponent will no doubt be an IM within a few years and has already beaten several strong grandmasters with his aggressive style. Jakob Aabling-Hiomsen - Jacob Aagaard Helsingor 2012 l.e4 c5 2.d4 cxd4 3.c3 fofGl With a dangerous book just out, there was no way I was going to take the risk of accepting the Morra!
4.e5 5^d5 5.£\B d6 6.ilc4 5}b6 7Ab3 dxe5
8.5^xe5 e6 9.O-O Nc6
Black gets an isolated pawn as well as White, but rids himself of the only attacking asset that White has. The future is quite safe now! Besides, Black's isolated pawn is not as weak as White's at the moment, as Black can force an exchange of them with ...c5, a possibility White does not have.
10.5^xc6 bxc6 ll.cxd4 ile7
8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 The opening is over and it is time to lay out a plan for the middlegame. From Black's perspective, it is all about solving problems one by one. Putting it simply, he wants to obtain good squares for the bishop on c8 and the knight on b6, and to put pressure on the d4-pawn. I decided to put the bishop on d5 and the knight on f5 (I was already anticipating that I would have to play ...g6 to defend my king). 1 quickly rejected all ideas of an early ...c5. The main downside I could find to this plan was that the bishop on d5 could be slightly in the way; but then I was not trying to prove anything, just to put my pieces on decent squares and see how my opponent decided to react. I am happy if this sounds like very simplistic thinking, because then it can be replicated. Good positions are generally built on a foundation of staying friends with all of your pieces, as well as keeping an eye on what is important and what the opponent might be up to.
12.Nc3
White had the chance to play 12.Qf3, leading to an exchange of the isolated pawns after 12...O-O. The position is equal, and White would have to give up all ambition to play like this. Maybe it was something he should have considered!?
[diagram]
12...O-O 13.Q6
8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 White is heading for h3 with the queen, wanting to checkmate me. Unfortunately he has lost his strategic argument for this plan - the knight on e5. Against best play the attack should not be dangerous for Black. So instead of worrying about getting mated, I wondered about how to put my inactive pieces on the right squares. I saw no reason not to progress with the plan I had laid down a few moves previously and went for the first obvious step.
13..Jka6
Having castled, Black has this extra option. The regrouping starts. l4.Sdl l4.Sel was more logical in some ways, aiming to place the other rook on dl, but the computer points out that I4...Qxd4 15.Qxc6 5=Sac8 I6.Qf3 Sfd8 is pleasant for Black.
14...5c8 15.1c2 tc4
Strategically this was the only move; the bishop transfers to d5 before White has time to play b2-b3, preventing it. I6.b3
[diagram]
Chapter 2 - Pieces 93 Played to dominate the b6-knight, but it also weakens some squares. All moves are a bit like that.
16...Bd5
[diagram]
The first step of the plan has been accomplished. I could not really work out how strong the bishop was on d5. As mentioned, it does feel like it is a bit in the way and not so easy to move. But at the same time it does control a lot of the board, and even though there are no serious weaknesses there now, there is no guarantee for White that these will not appear in the future. White continued with his plan, not yet doubting its validity.
17 Jfh3 g6 18.1h6 Se8 19.Sd3
[diagram]
After a few forced moves it was finally time for me to return to my own plan. 1 wanted to put pressure on the d4-pawn and bring the knight in from the cold on b6 and put it on the highest tower (f5) like a beacon, visible at the edge of the board (h6, for example) and in control of the centre (d4, for sure!). In order to do so 1 had to reorganize my pieces in a sensible way.
19...5c7
The rook is going to d7 to put pressure on the d4-pawn, as well as freeing the c8-square for the knight.
20.Sadl
Jakob is starting to lose his way. It was time to play 20.^,f4 jkd6 21.jke5! forcing some kind of concession. In this way the struggle would have remained tense, though Blacks chances should not be worse.
20...5d7 2lJfg4
To deliver mate you usually need something extra - a very solid centre, a good knight or pawn on e5, or maybe a serious weakness on the kingside. Here there are none of those things, so White's attacking pose is over-optimistic.
21...Nc8
The knight is coming to f5.
22.Rg3
[diagram]
22...1A5!
It is good to have a simple plan, but you should implement it with a certain level of intelligence and attention to the opponent's options. Here I wanted to put the knight on f5, without having to think about the pawn structure which would arise after 22...^d6
23.Nxd5 cxd5. This is probably good for
Black, but I wanted to keep the advantages I had, rather than exchange them for different ones - especially since my opponent was doing so poorly in dealing with the problems he had.
23.Ne2?!
Clearly White is losing his grip. After 23.ilf4 Ne7 24Jie5 Nf5 25.Sh3 Bg7 I like my position, but I am not sure if I am objectively better. But now White's position disintegrates.
23...Nd6? 24.Nf4?
24.,S,g5 was the last chance.
24...6B!

25.SH3
After 25Jbcf5 exf5 26.Qxf5 I was planning the simple 26.. Jke4, followed by taking on d4. But even more accurate is 26...jbcd4! with a winning position. The obvious threat is ...Be4 followed by ...jbtf2*|\ but we should also notice what the idea is against 27.Rfl:
[diagram]
27..Jbcf2t! and White can only resign.
Now we had a moment where it clearly makes sense to calculate. Black can take on h6 and have a nice and safe advantage - but there is also the pawn on d4. From afar I was sure that I could take it, yet I still checked everything carefully, looking for plausible faults, but found none.

1. M. Rasmussen - Ziska
Helsingor 2007
[diagram]
Blacks worst-placed piece is the knight on a6. He is able to bring it into play by a simple tactic.
20...Nb4!
20...jkd4f was also possible, but is more
double-edged. After 21.Nxd4 cxd4 22.^dl £k5 23.b4 ^e4 24JLel both players can find good things to say about their position, and it is not obvious which side to support. 2lJfdl? White had to play 21.axb4 cxb4f 22.^hl bxc3, when because of the threat of ...ftf2f, White has to accept a worse position after
23.bxc3 @c7^.
[diagram]
In the long term the a-pawn and the c5- square are great assets for Black.
21.Qb3? is bad for two reasons. The tactical
21...£"xd5! immediately nets a pawn, or Black
may prefer the more positional 21...^xd3!?
22.Qxb6 axb6 23.Sxd3 b5! and the white
position is collapsing because of 24.cxb5 Rxe2
25.^xe2 Jbcb5 26.£\cl Se8! with a strong
attack. The latter line is the one I came up with in order to answer a pupil who asked why the queen move was no good. However, had I spotted the hanging d-pawn, I would not have gone into such elaborate measures. That said, I still like the positional line because it shows the potential in the black pieces, and objectively it is at least as strong as simply grabbing the pawn.
21...Nxd3 22.Sxd3 Qa6! 23.b3 b5+
Black has a fantastic attack on the light squares and won in 51 moves.
2. Shaw - Hebden
Liverpool 2006
[diagram]
White wants to play Sgl and g4-g5, in the long term, to cramp the black pieces. He might also want to exchange the light-squared bishops at some point with ^g4. Black's worst Chapter 2 - Pieces 101 pieces are the h7-knight and g7-bishop. Both have been moved, but are unhappy where they are. The weakness in the white position is the dark squares, especially f4, so it is natural to seek an influence there, which is exactly what Black did.
12...±f6! 13.Nfl
13.^,h6 does not achieve anything. Black is
just as happy with the rook on e8 as f8, as he intends to play ...Sh8 eventually anyway.
13...1g5 I4jfd2Qf6 15.O-O-O Bf4!
Making room for the knight on h7 to enter the game. Black is already a little better, I think. Whites disadvantages are long term, so it will not become absolutely apparent immediately.

3. Kramnik - Shirov
Wijk aan Zee 2007
[diagram]
Whites knight on f3 is inactive and the c5- square is very attractive. As there are no real targets in the position, going there is a great first step.
18.&el!b4
18...^c6 19.Nd3!= still favours White, on
account of 19...£}xd4? 20.Hxa8 Hxa8 21.&hl! and the pin will eventually cost Black a piece for insufficient compensation.
19.Nd3 lb5 20.£k5±
[diagram]
20...Nb7
The knight is immediately challenged. However, the black knight is not pretty on b7 and White is able to achieve a series of small positional gains because of the strong knight on c5.
21.Hxa8 Hxa8 22.iLxb5 Qxb5 23.Qd3! I=fc6
24.Na4!
The knight is not allowed to stay on c5, but it remains a powerful force, even from this slightly decentralized square.
24...6.8 25.Scl Qb7 26.Rc2
Taking control over the c-file. Blacks defence is very difficult.

4. Vallejo Pons - Leko
Monte Carlo (rapid) 2004
[diagram]
This position is of course not greatly complicated, and the solution is simple. There are no weaknesses and nothing in particular is going on at the moment, but Black does have the chance to acquire the two bishops. All things being equal, it is better to have them than not, so this is what he should do.

5. Van de Griendt - Van der Heijden
Netherlands 2009
[diagram]
Chapter 2 - Pieces 103 White is able to use all his advantages to bring his currently restricted pieces on d3 and c3 to life. Black has three obvious weaknesses, d6, g5 and h5, and a less obvious weakness on h7. If he had the time to play ...5^f4, he would be laughing, but it is White to go. I4.e5! A typical move for the Modern Benoni, forcing Black to put a pawn on his beloved e5-square, opening up lines for the white pieces and clearing the way for the d-pawn's advancement. I4.Qd2 looks tempting, but Black can gain some counterplay and practical chances with: I4...Nf4!? 15.ibcf4 gxf4 I6.Qxf4 £}e5
17.Nxe5 (\7±e2 f5<>) 17..J,xe5 18.Qh6 f5±
White is of course better, but the e5-bishop is strong, so proving this advantage will not be altogether easy.
14.Nh4 is a funny move, but it does not really
solve the issue with the dark squares. Black has several tempting replies, for example: I4...^e5 15Jbce5 Qxe5 16.Qxh5 gxh4 17.Qxh4 jbd7 with the idea of ...b5 with counterplay. Again the extra pawn counts for something, but how much is hard to tell.
14...dxe5
Forced. I4...5^f4 does not work. White plays 15.exd6, when Black cannot recapture. And after 15...Qf6 16.Ne4 Qxb2 17.Rbl Sfa3 White can choose between 18.jkc4 and
18.jbcf4 gxf4 19.5^eg5 h6 20.5^e6!, in both
cases with a winning position.
14...h6 15.e6!+- results in the total
disintegration of the black position.
15.d6!
[diagram]
15...Qd8
15...Qe6 I6.Bxh7t Nh8 17.^e4 is a
disaster, of course... I6.Nd5 ^h8 17.^1e7 Nf4 Black could defend a bit better, but he is still lost.
18.Nxg5 H6 19.1c4! hxg5 20.Bxf4

6. Roiz - Piscopo
Trieste 2010
[diagram]
Black's last move, 4...^d7, has left the bishop a bit exposed on g4. It seems innocuous, as an escape square can be arranged rather quickly. But the problem is that White will enjoy having his knight on g5 just fine, while Black has to place his pieces awkwardly.
5.Ng5!
Not the ideal square for the knight, but the alternatives 5...Qb6 6.h3 Jkc8 7.e4 and 5...h6
6.Nxf7! Nxf7 7.h3 are even more awkward.
6.h3 k&7 7.ffb3±
White won on move 29.
7. Roiz - Bobras
Germany 2010
[diagram]
12.e5!
With this simple move White dominates all of the black minor pieces. The remainder of the game should have been Black suffocating slowly (or quickly), but instead he got off the hook when White misplayed a pawn-up endgame in very uncharacteristic fashion.
12...Sb8
12...b6 is the only move requiring a bit
of calculation. Even after exchanging on b6 or playing 13.a6 White is better, but the refutation is quite something: 13.Qa4! ?Bxa5 I4.b4 Nb7 15.^,a6 Hb8 16.Qc6 and White wins material. The pawns take care of the dark squares and the queen and bishop wins material on the light ones.
13.f4 e6 I4.d5?!
l4JLg2! made more sense; there is no great need for White to hurry. The proof of the pudding comes after eating the a7-pawn:
14...Ne7 15.d5 exd5 16.Nxa7±
14...exd5 15.£}xd5 b6 I6.axb6
I6.Rdl!? is Roiz's suggestion, but I am not wholly convinced by his variations and evaluations. I think White is better, but it is not entirely clear.
16...axb6
I6...£}xb6!±
17.Sdl Qh4
[diagram]
We shall leave the game here, noting that it was drawn in 57 moves. But here Roiz missed a nice tactic in 18.Qc4! winning the c7-pawn, with the point 18...^e7?
19.f5!! Nxf5 20.Qxh4 ?}xh4 21.fte7t and
White wins a piece. Chapter 2 - Pieces 105
8. Jakovenko - Eljanov
8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 White's position looks visually better. He has two bishops and his pieces are active. On top of this his king is safer - slightly passive, but safer. Of course, if the queens were exchanged, Black's king position would change from exposed to active. And the three slightly exposed pawns on a3, d4 and h4 would become more important. This is the reason for Eljanov's next move.
27..Jfe7!
Preparing ...^f5 and the exchange of queens. This will not solve all of Black's problems at once, but it goes a long way towards making Black's position playable.
28.g3
Not the most dangerous; White can retain a slight edge, though it is not easy to see how.
28.jk.d3 Nf5 29.Qa4! produces some problems
for Black, but they can all be solved. Wijk aan Zee 2007
[diagram]
8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 First he neutralizes the pressure down the c-file with 29...Rc8! and after the only dangerous idea 30.Sel he then plays:
30...^xh4 31."i,g3 Rc3! (An important move.
After 31...^g6? White gains an advantage with 32.f4!± with a strong attack. The main tactical point is 32...Qd7 33.f5!! Jbcf5 34Jkb5 and White wins the exchange after 34...Qb7
35."i,a6 with serious winning chances in the
resulting endgame. The weakness of the a7- pawn is a crucial factor.) 32.Qb5 (White has nothing after 32.j^,e2 ftf5 33.il,xh5t g6=)
32...Qxa3 33.ibch4 Qxb3 34.Qxb3 Rxb3
White has a tiny edge in this ending, but with decent play Black should hold comfortably. A very natural idea is 28.^e2 g6 29.Qa4 to get the queen to an active square with tempo. But there are downsides too - it does not solve the problem with the pawns, and the bishop is a bit exposed on e2. 29...ftf5 looks almost equalizing to me. 30.Hc7 and now:
[diagram]
a) 30...Bd7?! is punished by 31.@xa7! and the ghost of the passed a-pawn will haunt Black for a long time. A possible line is: 31...£}xd4
32.ifl Sxc7 33.1xc7 <Sxb3 34.Qxb6 Rc5
(34...Nd2? 35.il,d8!± and the f6-square/pawn is a target.) 35.a4± Maybe Black can draw this, but it is certainly uncomfortable, and White has other options on the way. b) 30...j^d7! A nice tactic based on the ...^xd4-e6 threat. White has only one reasonable way to react: 31.Jk.b5! (31.Qxa7? Nxd4+) 31...Qelt 32jkfl Ne8 33.Qa6 (33.Qxa7 Nxd4 34.Qa6! ^,b5 35.Qxb6 Wxflf 36.^h2 Qxf2 37.Qxf6 £}f3t 38.^h3 miraculously offers White a draw!) 33...Nxd4
34.Scl Qe4 35.^e3 £k6°°
28.jbcd6! is a very clever idea.
8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 The main point is that the exchange of queens would be followed by jkb5! and the rook entering the game on c7, when Black would be under some technical pressure.
28...Rxd6 29.Qd2± White manages to hold
on to some of his advantages, mainly the more active rook and better king position. Black should be able to defend successfully, but had this happened, there would definitely have been scope for another exercise!
28...6B 29.Sc7
29.Qxe7t ^xe7 30.Sdl S&f7 and ...Se8

9. Ivanchuk - Miton
Sochi 2007
[diagram]
If nothing happens immediately, the centre will disappear in a cascade of exchanges, for example after 21.,i,b2. The way to success lies in exploiting the lack of stability of the knight on a5 and the bishop on b7.

10. Gashimov - Mamedyarov
Elista 2008
[diagram]
White has an inactive bishop on d3. The great weakness in the black position is the pawn on e6 (and the light squares in general as a consequence of the earlier exchange of White's dark-squared bishop for the f6- knight). So the solution is to bring the bishop to b3, from where it can put pressure on e6. Simple chess, but very effective.
21.c3!= kc7 22.kc2 Qe5 23.g3
A bit slow. 23.He2!? was perhaps even stronger. Black would be lost after 23...d5?!
24.ftd3! Qxh2?! 25.exd5 Rg3 26.Qf2 because
of 26...exd5 27.^b4+-, so he would need to play 23...1c6 24.Bb3!? exf5 25.Nd5 Bd7

11. Adams-Werle

White needs to sort out the problem with the knight on a4. This piece would be well placed on d3, which explains Adams' play.
19.Be4!± Sb8
Black is freeing the queen by protecting the bishop once more.
20.Nb2?!
This is maybe a bit too rushed, as Black has a reasonable counter available.
20.Hadl!± is more flexible. White retains the
option of ^b2-d3, but prefers to wait for Black to play ...^b6 first. And in the case of
20...Qa5 White can switch his play to the
other side of the board with 21.h4!->.
20..Jfd8?!
20...ibce4 21.Bxc4 Qa5! looks like a better
defensive try. After 22.Qcl Qa3! Black would be ready for ...a6-a5-a4 with counterplay, so White should instead return to a4 with the knight, but clearly time has been lost.

12. Razuvaev - Stohl
Germany 1992

This position is relatively easy to understand. Black has a bad bishop on d6. White secures an advantage by taking control of the light Chapter 2 - Pieces 109 squares around it, and condemns the black pieces to passivity.
23.b5!=
Had it been Black to play, maybe ...b5 would have been his move.

13. Zvjaginsev - Wang Hao
Taiyuan 2007
[diagram]
White has achieved quite a comfortable position out of the opening, but needs to breathe more life into his pieces in order to make something of it. To do so he will have to advance his pawns on the queenside eventually, while also putting some pressure on Black in the centre and making it hard for him to mobilize his forces. Looking at the black position, we can see that the bishops are a bit exposed. Combine these factors and we have an obvious candidate.
15.Ne2!±
A nice multipurpose move that aims to harass the black bishops, at the same time clearing the way to reinforce the d4-pawn with j|,d2-c3 and preparing to advance with b2-b4.
15...Nbd7
In a bad position there are no good moves. Black decides to give up his bishop in order to get his pieces out. Had he chosen otherwise, he might have been criticised for neglecting his development. The fact of the matter is that he was facing an unpleasant choice.
15...1kf8 is probably best answered by the
simple I6.h3 followed by Nf4 with a serious advantage. I6.Nf4 17.iLc3 ild6 18.Nxe6 5^xe6
19.16
White is dominating and won on move 36.
14. Shomoev - Sebag
Moscow 2010
[diagram]
This position could be a little controversial. The computers I have asked do not fully agree about the power of Shomoev's move. Hopefully I will be able to explain it convincingly. I4.±b4! The point of this move is two-fold. First of all White is ridding himself of his bad bishop, a general positional idea. Secondly, by exchanging it for the knight, he is creating a position where the bishop on c8 will always be bad. This is a simple case of good pieces and bad pieces. I do not want to make it any more complicated than this, though of course it is more complicated than this in practice. l4...Se8 15.1xe7Qxe7 16.Nc5 Sd8 17.Scl Sb8 18.b3 kb7 19.2c4± White won on move 45. My evaluation here is "close to winning", albeit with a lot of practical problems to overcome.
15. Anand - Wang Hao
Wijk aan Zee 2011
[diagram]
This theoretical position was considered decent for Black until this game. But actually Anand s novelty is not so difficult to work out. Black has sacrificed a pawn in order to split White's pawns and get active play against them. The hint as to the solution to this position is the lame goat on e2. It is almost impossible to find a good square for this knight, no matter how far you manoeuvre it around, so the idea of just giving it up should pop into your mind sooner or later - it just takes a little imagination. l6Ad4! exd4 17.cxd4 fibc6 This leaves the knight on a5 out on a limb to some extent, but there is not really any alternative - Black needs to get into the game quickly and must be prepared to give back the piece.
18 Jfc3 Ne7
A necessity. 18...Had8 19.d5 ibcd5 20.exd5 Hxd5 21.Sadi is poor for Black. The two bishops are simply too much for Black to deal with over time.

16. Carlsen - Anand
Monaco (blindfold) 2011 Black is offered the chance to give White tripled pawns. The question is whether this is a good thing or not - and the answer is yes, although it is quite double-edged. The main swaying factors are that the bishop on d7/c6 will find little resistance on the light squares and that the white bishop will find it difficult to live up to its full potential, as the pawns on c3 and c5 prevent it using the long diagonal. f g h It is apparent that White will have to exchange his bishop in a moment. The question is of course for which minor piece. The easiest way for us to determine this is to investigate the positions arising from the various options and look at their positional features one by one. This can be time-consuming and grandmasters will not do this consciously, but they will do it subconsciously.
19.ibcc5!
19.ibtg5? Qxg5 gives White nothing. For
example, 20.Qg3 Qxg3 21.^xg3 f4 22.?}fl a5 and Black is by no means worse.
19.exf5? is the wrong move order. After
19...Hxf5 20.Qg3 Qf6 Black will either
exchange the bishops or gain strong counterplay against f2 after 2lJbcc5 (21.d4? Jkh4! 22.Qh2 exd4 23.cxd4 Sxf2 24.dxc5 Re8 25Jbcf2 jbcf2t 26.^hl jkxel 27.Rxel Rxe2-+) 21 ...dxc5.

20...5xf5
This looks anti-positional, but Black is absolutely in need of the counterplay on the f-file in order to stay in the game. After 20...gxf5 21.^g3 Qd7 22.iLb3± Black's position is intensely unpleasant. His dark- square control by no means matches his opponent's lockdown on the light squares. All the black pawns are targets, while the white pawn on c3 easily dominates the black pieces. 2lJfg4Bh4 Aimed partly at the f2-pawn and partly at the g3-square, to prevent the white knight transferring to the e4-square.

(After 24...h5 White can claim a slight structural edge with 25.Qxg5 if he wants a safe option, or he can go for the more aggressive 25.Qa4!, when Black is forced into the following sequence: 25...b5 26.Rxd3 bxa4 27.^xf5t gxf5
28.Rd7t Nf6 29.Rxc7 and the endgame is very
close to winning for White.) 25.^xf5t Qxf5

a good ending or the highly attractive option of pushing Black backwards. 27.Qc4| ^h8

Instead of pushing the clumsily placed rook back from f5 with this move, White should have played 25.Qe4!± with lovely control over the position. Following the move played, the game was drawn on move 40 after good defence from Mamedyarov.

Chapter 2 - Pieces 113 The worst-placed piece is the rook on a 1, so we need to find a square for it. I instinctively disliked placing it on the d-file, where I could see nothing other than exchanges. Actually there is also a cold shower in 17...e5! followed by ..Jkg4! Whites main superiority as far as I could see was on the kingside and for this reason I decided to double on the e-file.
17.Se2!
17.Ne5 a5!?
17...a6
A rather passive move with no plan at all. Istvan had seen a game where Black played very similarly to our game, but this is not enough. You have to react to your opponents moves and intentions; playing according to general ideas without understanding the undercurrent of positional considerations and ideas is a poor strategy.
17..Jkc6± was probably the best move. White
will take the bishop (to prevent it from coming to d5 and offering Black enough defensive resources) and have a slight edge in a rather technical position. Now he has time enough to generate an attack.
18.Rael Nh8?
Black felt forced to play this because of the threat of ^xe6. But it is really an ugly move and he should not have allowed himself to play it.
18...1.6 was worse than on the previous move,
of course, as the a-pawn might have preferred to be on a7 in many lines, but nevertheless this was necessary. I9±c5 Sffi
19...itc6 20.Qg3 now gives White serious
attacking chances. It is too late for 20...ild5 on account of 21 Bc7, so Black needs to try

I do not believe the black position can be saved. 20...Bc6 can be refuted by 21.Qh3 g6
22.^xe6! and the attack cuts straight through.
Also after 20...Bc8 White will win. This time with 21.Qh3 h6 22.g4! and there is too much pressure on the kingside. For example:
22...Ng8 23.Qd3 f5 24.Nxf5 exf5 25Jbcg7t
and the black king has entered the hunting season as the rear end of a donkey.
21.Qh3 g6
21...h6 is also met by 22.He3! with a

Whites attack is irresistible. The black pieces are packed too tightly in the centre to do anything against 27.^f5! and 28.ibcf6, with mate to come.

New Delhi/Teheran (2.2) 2000 This is a relatively easy position for White ro play. Should Black be allowed to take on f3 and d3 he would have equalized. The e6-pawn might be weak in White's dreams, but it will only be a reality if he has the right pieces left - ideally knight against bishop. For this reason his first move is easy:

20. Leviczki - Porat
Budapest 2008
[diagram]
White is not happy in the middlegame where his exposed king is a problem. But in an ending he is simply better because of his superior pawn structure and the way his pawns limit the scope of the opposing pieces - it is easier to do this when sacrificing a piece is no longer an option for the opponent.

White converted this superior ending on move 76.

White invades the black position with great force: 22.Nd6 Sf8 23.Sa4 Qb6 24.gc4 Qd8 25.Rc7 and White wins. For example:

This strong move exploits the lack of good squares for the black queen as well as the main problem behind Blacks last move (l6...Sb8?). Maybe the best reply would be to return with
17...Ra8, but this is hardly inspiring, of course.
17...6e8

Usually in this variation Black equalizes quite easily by exchanging his c-pawn, but here, because of Black's unfortunate 16th move, White has gained enough time to put strong pressure on the pawns. Here 21...c5? is met with 22.£}xd7 and dxc5, winning a decisive amount of material.
21...5b5 22.c4!?
It is understandable that Wells could not resist forcing the black rook to a5, but the simple 22.£}xd7 Rxd7 23.Qxa6 Sa5 24.Qe2 with an extra pawn and the two bishops should also give White fantastic winning chances.
22...5a5 23.Qc2 c5 24.d5 la4?!
It is as if White is moving the pieces for both players here. With this move Black is trapping his own rook, a factor that decides the game in just a few moves time. The best move was 24...Ra3, even though White would still have a clear advantage after
25.Sael. It is because of this variation that I
believe 22.£}xd7 was more convincing. Chapter 2 - Pieces 117

A typical idea. Besides getting rid of White's good bishop and his bishop pair at the same time, his only knight is also exchanged, which allows Black to commit what might superficially appear to be a strategic "blunder".
22.1efxd4 e5!
The d5-square is not weak, because it cannot be occupied. However, the d4-square really is weak, because it can be occupied! Black's play is easier because his knight is superior to the bishop, but the advantage is slight at this point, of course. 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1

24. Ciuksyte - Safarli
8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 For some reason White refrained from playing: 26&e7l This would exchange the f8-bishop, thereby relieving Black of his bishop pair and all chances of defending the dark squares (and in particular the c 5-pawn). I guess that she simply missed the idea completely. White's advantage would be considerable. Instead she went on to lose in 58 moves. Internet 2008

Chapter 3 Prophylaxis Nadezhda Kosintseva - Lilit Mkrtchian Jcrmuk 2012
[diagram]
Black to play In a game between two of the top women players in the world, White is looking for an attack on the kingside as well as a small positional trick. How should Black address this? Chess is played with pieces, and games are won by attacking the opponent's weaknesses. But it is not enough to focus on our own ambitions; we have to remember that our opponent has every second move. This is why it is important for us to include prophylactic thinking in our arsenal of thinking tools. In this chapter we will look at some of the most common aspects of prophylactic thinking. Hie idea behind the last move Prophylactic thinking is best described as attention to the opponents ideas. It is not the reaction to them or the prevention of them; it is simply taking them into account. One of the ways to do this is to think about the point of your opponent's last move. Jacob Aagaard - Davit Shengelia Porto Carras 2011
[diagram]
With my last move, 12.j|,cl-d2?!, I had anticipated my opponent's obvious break, but had not seen far enough. It transpires that the bishop needed to be on f4, when White was probably a bit better.
12...dxc4! 13.ilxc4 c5!
After he played this, I sank into deep, desperate thought. My opponent had anticipated my planned reply to this break,
14.d5 exd5 15Jbcd5, which gave him the
chance to look deeper and see that 15...Nxe5! would give him^a significant advantage. So instead I decided to complete my development with the aid of a tactical idea. l4.Scl? In retrospect, it would have been better to fight for equality with I4.dxc5 Nxc5 15.£}xc5 Jbcc5 I6.a6b6 17.Scl, when White is probably still sort of okay.
[diagram]
Again it makes sense for Black to ask himself what White intended with his last move. It appears that taking twice on d4 and then e5 is not possible, as White can then play 17.^xe6! with an advantage. Armed with this knowledge, my opponent looked for a flaw in my thinking - and found it. I4...Nxd4! I now played 15."fi,c3 and managed to create some resistance before I blundered again at move 40. The main point of my opponent's play becomes visible only after: Chapter 3 - Prophylaxis 121
15.^bxd4 cxd4 16.^xd4
[diagram]
As said, Black will not fall for 16...^xe5?
17.^xe6! when White has the advantage. He
no doubt intended to play:
16...Sxc4! 17.Sxc4 Jld3
And the e5-pawn will be lost. But of course prophylaxis can at times be far more basic. In the following example Black failed to look for his opponent's idea carefully enough, and went down in a very painful way. Karen Grigoryan - Yaroslav Zherebukh Athens 2012
[diagram]
Prophylaxis exists in tactics as well, of course. The following is a good example of how we need to look a bit deeper into our opponent's thoughts and ideas. Seemingly a winning attempt, but actually it loses directly. After 29.. Jbce6 30.Qxe6t Nh7 31 .Qh3 Sc8!? White would struggle to prove compensation for his sacrificed piece.
30.6 iR,xe6
30...g5 was not the intention, of course.
White wins after 31 .Jbcg5 Bxe6 32.fxe6f ^g8
33.e7 Qc8 34.Qg3 Qe6 35.ikf6 Sf7 36.Qxd6
with total domination.
31.fxg6f!
[diagram]
This must have come as a complete shock to poor Zherebukh. White would much rather have a pawn on g6 than on e6. But in reality it was not so difficult to predict this move if you took the time to look carefully for it.
31...Ng8 32.1fxe6t &I18 33.1ff5
White does not close the deal in the most effective way, but wins anyway.
33.Hf5! was immediately decisive.

Rb8 37.1g5! Nd4
37...Qg8 38.Qxd6 Bh5 39.1f6 gives White

38.fff7 Sh5 39.kf6
1-0 What would your opponent do now if he was to move? (What are his short-term goals?) One of the questions you might find useful is: What would my opponent do if he was to move? Looking at the position from the other side of the board (though not physically - that would be weird!) can help you to understand the position better; or at least to avoid accidents like the following... Nasir Ahmed - John Shaw Edinburgh 2003
[diagram]
Had John looked for his opponent's threat, he would have seen it quite quickly and played
29...Rbe8!, when he probably would have won
the game. However, John focused only on his own threats and ideas and tried to provoke White into advancing his g-pawn, so that he could put a knight on f5 with complete domination. The punishment was swift and brutal.
29...1d7? 30 Jfe3!±
We now see that White wants to play f4-f5 to activate his bishop and maybe improve things with f5-f6f npct. This is possible because of the threat down the e-file. Had Black placed his rook on e8, ideas like this would not have worked.
30...1xg4?
This is rubbish, but John is in trouble anyway. Necessary was 30...Qdf5 31.gxf5 ^xf5 32.Qf3 RLc6, when Black has some compensation for the piece and practical chances (to swindle).
31.6 &ex6 32.1e5t
This is good enough, but even stronger was
32.ibcd6 Nxe3 33.1e5t ^f8 34.Bxe3 and
Black is losing everything.
32...fS 33.Jhcd6 Nxe3 34.Sxe3 ^6 35.5x6
1x6 36.1xb8 d4 37.Se7t Nh6 38.1f4t g5
39.1d2 dxc3 40.itxc3
1-0 Your opponent's long-term goals Prophylaxis can be quite deep, of course, but it is always a question of style. For example, Petrosian was famous for preventing his opponents' ideas long before they ever got the chance to have them. And Karpov probably spent more of his time looking for ways to eliminate his opponent's possible desires than any other World Champion, which explains why he drew so often with Black. With White, he would prevent his opponent from equalizing and keep the pressure on, until a Chapter 3 - Prophylaxis 123 pleasant ending would arise. With Black, he would prevent the opponent from gaining an advantage, rather than looking for ways to gain one himself. Is this you? If you are an attacking player, then probably not. On the other hand, if you are more like an accountant than an axe- wielding madman, maybe this is you. In general, prophylaxis becomes more important when you have a static advantage. In endgames, following the advice, "Do not hurry!" and preventing counterplay are the key technical tools. But the principle seems sound in all phases of the game. Here is a good example straight out of the opening. Pavel Eljanov - Gata Kamsky Kallithea 2008
[diagram]
Black is under slight pressure down the long diagonal and will have to free himself with ...Hc8 and ...d6, as after 14...d5? 15.cxd5 cxd5 I6.^xd5! White wins material. Blacks weakness is the h5-pawn, so Eljanov decided to prepare the Ne5-d3-f4 manoeuvre to put pressure on it. I4.e3! Defending the d4-pawn in advance. White could have reversed his 14th and 15th moves, but this is more human and maybe a bit more flexible.
14...Sc8 15.Sacl!
Eljanov again prevents his opponent's idea. It is slightly less important that White also would be much better after 15.£}d3 d5, because of I6.cxd5 Jbcd3 17.Sxd3 (Eljanov only considers 17.d6, which also gives White some advantage.) 17...cxd5 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1
18.^xd5! exd5 19.9xd5 Qd7 20.Qxh5±
White will also grab the g4-pawn with a huge advantage, as Black would shed more material after 20...^f6 21.@e5!. The game is of course not decided yet, but Black is going to struggle to prove his compensation. Still Eljanov's solution is simply better; it involves no risk and leaves Black with no easy choices.
15...d6 16.Nd3 kh6
I do not particularly like this move; it relies too much on White putting his knight on f4, as the bishop will otherwise be entirely out of play. After 16...SW 17.fcf4 QfiS 18.Ne4± Black would find defending the h5-pawn very difficult.
[diagram]
17.Qa4!?
Again a beautiful practical decision by Eljanov. White is preparing d4-d5 and an assault on the light squares, now that the dark- squared bishop is out of play on h6. Having said that, we should note that 17.Nf4 was perfectly fine as well: 17...iLxf4 18.exf4 <5W 19.Sel! 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 There is no way for Black to defend against the threats of f4-f5 and d4-d5, as White is planning to play Qa3 or Qa4, forking important squares. I think White is more or less winning already.
17...Ab7 18.d5
White continues with his plan. Putting the knight on f4 was still a serious option.
18...b5
Desperation. 18...cxd5 19.cxd5 e5 also does not work. White would play 20.^b4!± and Jke4-f5 with close to complete domination.
[diagram]
19.dxc6!
A nice little tactic that effectively wins the game. Again there was a plausible alternative:
19.cxb5 cxd5 20.ibcd5! Sxc3 2ljbcb7 Sxcl
22.iixa8 Sxdlt 23.Qxdl and White has an
extra pawn. On the other hand, Black has managed to solve some of his problems and he might have a chance of saving the ending.
19..Jbtc6 20.^xb5 a6 21.ilxc6 Nxc6
22.Nc3
White has won a pawn and won the game on move 53. Good prophylactic play by Eljanov in a position where many would have looked too soon for a dynamic way to exploit the advantage. The next example shows how we should be careful not to allow our opponents even small improvements; something we can only do if we pay sufficient attention to their intentions. In this example we shall discuss various aspects of prophylactic thinking - armed with the power of hindsight.
[diagram]
Chapter 3 - Prophylaxis 125 Svetozar Gligoric - Wolfgang Unzicker Bath 1973
[diagram]
We join the game in the middle of the middlegame, in a position where White is evidently better. His pawn structure is preferable and his pieces are better placed. Still, it is no catastrophe, and Black should be able to save the game with good play.
27.b3
Played for several reasons, but primarily in order to regroup the bishop from e3 to b2, to take control of the e5-square, which will enable White to gain the two bishops, and put pressure on the black kingside down the long diagonal.
27...5fd8 28.1cl
This is the critical moment where Black does not have an easy move, but has to think hard about how to counter his opponent's idea.
28...5MS?
At first I was not entirely sure what the idea was behind this move. Usually grandmasters have an idea behind their moves (always, according to Mark Dvoretsky), but here it took me a long time to see it. It seems that Black is clearing the e7-square to create a route for his knight to get to c6/d4 to fight for the dark squares. This manoeuvre takes a lot of time and not surprisingly fails by a tempo. 29±b2 h6 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1
30.Ng2!
Fabulous technique by Gligoric. He saw the possibility of 30.fte5 being met with
30...ibce5 3lJbce5 c4!?, and decided not to
allow unnecessary counterplay. 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 Whether or not this actually works is beside the point. Calculating long lines here would not be practical, while the move in the game can be played without calculation. Anyway, the consequences of the sacrifice are: 32.Qxc4 Sc8 33.Qa6 Qc5t 34.Ng2 Scd8 35.Bxf6 gxf6 36.1e2 Sd2 37.Sxd2 Sxd2 38.Sdl Sb2
39.^fl!± White has won a pawn and the black
king is somewhat exposed. But the position
[diagram]
still has some random character, and it was entirely unnecessary to allow that.
30...Ng8 31.Ne5!
Relying on the coming tactics. 31.J.e5!? was also possible, but Gligoric certainly had everything mapped out at this point.
31..Jbce5 32.Bxe5 Sk7 33.1b5!

4l...Qc6 42.Qg5 wins the house. 1-0 So, with the benefit of hindsight, we can see that Black should have fought against the occupation of the e5-square with all his might. This would have been a difficult task, but I think it was possible with 28...Nh5!?=

With perpetual check. Chapter 3 - Prophylaxis 127 The next example could just as well have been placed in the weaknesses chapter; but then almost every interesting position could be explained in terms of that paradigm! Nadezhda Kosintseva - Lilit Mkrtchian Jermuk 2012
[diagram]
If this position had been in Chapter 1, it would have been under the headline of Eliminating your own weaknesses. At the moment White has no problems with the c2-pawn, but Black is planning ...Nc8 to eliminate the disturbing knight and bring the f8-rook into play. For this reason the best move here is 21.c4!, after which Black keeps even chances with accurate play. Instead she played:
21.SB? Rc6l
The ideas above are pretty simple and Kosintseva of course understood them perfectly. She was no doubt planning to meet 21 ,..^c8 with
22.c4, taking advantage of the misplacement of
the black knight. By first attacking the c-pawn, all ideas with c2-c4 die, and White has to do more to get rid of her weakness.
22.c3 Nc8 23.Sh3?!
This is a shot in the dark. Black easily defends her kingside. It was necessary to change the course of the game, and this could have been done with
23.f5!? Nxd6 24.exd6 9xd6 25.c4!56, when I
think White would still have managed to keep the balance more or less; even if it is less fun to have compensation for the pawn here, than it is to have the extra pawn.
23...h6+
Black has a better structure and won the game on move 44. Prophylactic thinking in action - combine it with your own ideas Up to this point we have repeatedly seen how sound prophylactic thinking can be combined with achieving our own goals. In the following position Black is looking for ways to complete his development and get rid of his potentially weak pawn on d7 (as well as take control over the d-file). At the same time he managed to look out for his opponent's ideas. Ed Ferry - Jacob Aagaard Bearsden 2007
[diagram]
White is struggling a bit. His pieces are not well placed and Black has managed to obtain the two bishops. However, if he can play Nd3 and either £}f4 or Jkb4, things would change quite quickly and the advantage Black has at the moment could quickly disappear. To counter this plan is Blacks main objective in this position. I managed to do so by assaulting the centre at the same time.
16...d6!+
Lines I looked at during the game were
16..Jfb6 17.Nd3 Sc2 18.Sfcl gfc8 19!b4!=
and 16...f6 17.^d3 fxe5 18.dxe5 Hc4 19.f3°°, although not with the detail, accuracy and confidence I can attach now after looking at the game with computer assistance. My main idea with the game move is that
17.^d3 dxe5 would force White to play
18.ftxe5, because of 18.dxe5? M,c4.
17.1b4
This is of coursc the apparent problem with my move. But I had something special planned here.
17...dxe5
17...a5+ was also very strong, but I like my
move best.
18.ilxe7 Qxe7 19.dxe5 Bc4 20.^d3
[diagram]
This is the second moment of prophylaxis in the game. I correctly evaluated the "main" defensive option, the one he went for in the game. But we both missed that he had another option that would have held his position together.
20...5fd8?
The game was played with only one hour for the first thirty moves, which is the excuse for this inaccuracy.
20...Qd7! 21.Sfdl Sfd8 would transpose to
the game.
21.Sfdl?
White misses a great tactical defence. He should have played 21.Bfcl!, when Black only has traces of an advantage due to the exploitation of the back rank.
[diagram]
The best try is probably 21..Jbcd3 22.Hxc8 Bxc8 23.Qxd3 Qg5 24.Hel Sd8 25.Qc3 Qd2
26.QclT, but it is not much.
21..Jfd7 22.Sd2
This looks like the best chance, but I was ready for it. Chapter 3 - Prophylaxis 129
[diagram]
22..Jfd4!!
I cannot force the win of a piece, but I can create a pawn weakness in the white position.
23.Radl Qxe3 24.fxe3 jbcd3?
This is entirely unnecessary. The bishop outshines the knight in each and every way. Somehow I had the idea that the rook ending was just winning, which is more than a bit optimistic.
25.Sxd3 Sxd3 26.Sxd3 g5!/+
White might still have some fighting chances in the endgame, especially if he manages to keep out the black king on the kingside by putting a pawn on g4. However, this is not the only problem in the position. If Black manages to play ...a5 and ...2c5, it seems very unlikely that White will be able to hold. For this reason the only move was 27.Sa3!?.
27.Sd6?
After this the ending is lost.

The most important feature of this position is that Black has not yet managed to develop his pieces and bring his king to safety. With a simple move White makes this very difficult to accomplish, and he has already half won the game. I4.Bd4!± Simple, but deeply annoying. I4.f5 Be7 gives Black decent counterplay. The two bishops will have an effcct in the long run.
14...ftS
What else should Black play? I4...d6 leaves White with many tempting moves - such as
15."Ne5!? - but probably it is best to play 15.f5!
with various threats to the black kingside.
15.g4!
Apparently this logical thrust was a new move.
15..J.e7 16.g5 O-O?
This is suicidal. 16...fxg5 17Jbcg7 Rg8

White needs to make the most out of the pin and to rid himself of his worthless pawn on c2. This can be done with simple moves:
16.&hl! N7c6
I6...f6 17.c4± does not look much of an improvement to me.
17.c4! dxc4?!
This is a bit compliant, although it is fair to say that Black had no easy solutions available to him. After 17...Sfd8 18.Hel f6 19.cxd5 Hxd5 20.Qb3 he finds himself pinned in three directions. The best option should be to run from the pin, but after 17...Qd8! 18.iixc6 ftxc6 19.b5 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 White keeps the initiative, having taken the chance to advance on the queenside. Best play seems to be: 19...^a5 20.cxd5 Qxd5 21.Qxd5 exd5 22.Rfdl Sfd8 23Jkd6± I am not sure how difficult it will be for White to untangle his pieces after he wins the d5-pawn, so I don't want to call it a clear advantage just yet, but it is fair to say that we are closer to that than to equality.
18.Qe2 fG 19.ilxc4±

In the game White played 14.O-O? and after I4...iic6= Black did not face any problems. In his book Grandmaster Repertoire 1 - l.d.4 Volume One, Israeli Grandmaster Boris Avrukh points out that White could have prevented his opponent's rather obvious idea with I4.b5!, when it is much harder for Black to complete his development. It seems that the only move with a fighting chance is I4...a6, when White can play 15.O-O with a slight edge, or be more optimistic and play 15.b6! Qc8 I6.Na5 Nc6
17.N3c4±.
8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 It is clear that Black will have problems with the b7-pawn for a very long time; his position is truly unpleasant.
4. Skripchenko - Benmesbah
[diagram]
Pau 2008
[diagram]
Chapter 3 - Prophylaxis 137 Black wishes to finish her development with ...b6, when the disadvantage of having played ...f6 is more or less cancelled out by the two bishops. The other manoeuvre to be considered is ...Qe5-c6, with a tenable position. In the game White prevented this by simple means.
13.Qa7!
The most precise move. White is not only preventing Blacks two main ideas, but may also carry out plans involving !b6.
13.a5= would not really prevent Black from
advancing the b-pawn, although that would make a weakness out of the a6-pawn. And 13.Qd2 Qe5 14.f4 Qc6 15.Qb6 ld8
16.Qxc7 ikxc7 17.Qc4 Ne7 18.a5± is of
course unpleasant for Black, however it is by no means terminal.
13...O-O
13...b6 is prevented, and 13...Qe5?? would
simply lose a rook. "
13...1.8! was the best defensive try. White is
better, but there is no overwhelming advantage after I4.a5 b6 15.axb6 Qxb6 I6.Qxc7 Jbcc7
17.b3=, although the position is definitely
unpleasant for Black.
14.a5±
l4.Sd2± followed by Sadi was also very strong.
14..JU8
This move arrives too late and offers fewer chances than on the previous move.
14...Qc5!? may be Blacks best try, though
15.Sa3± preparing 16.b4 is promising for
White.

5. P. Carlsson - A. Smith
Stockholm 2007
[diagram]
The black king is obviously weak in the centre, but it will take some time for White to get through to it. In the meantime Black is threatening to break through on the kingside, specifically on g4 and g2. White found a simple and elegant way to keep the g-file closed, turning the immediate mess into a long-term initiative without significant counterplay.
29.h3! fxg4 30.h4!
White has successfully closed the g-file and is simply winning.
30...Qd5 31.axb6?!
Probably 31.e6! was even stronger, as it would be hard for Black to become active. 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 For example: 31...O-O-O 32.j^c7!, with the idea 32...Rde8 33.axb6 Rxe6 34.Sxe6 Qxe6
35.itd8! and White wins.
31...axb6 32.Sxb6 Sa2?!
I think that 32...2a3 33.Rb3 Sxb3 34.cxb3 Rg7 was the correct way to play. White is probably winning, but the threat to g2 makes the conversion a bit less smooth than White might have hoped a few moves back.
33.Sebl Sg7
33...ikc8 34.e6! would lead to similar
devastation.
34.e6!
Closing in on the king and threatening things such as Sfl.

6. Anand - Morozevich
World Championship, Mexico City 2007
[diagram]
White has a very pleasant position from a static point of view. His knight will make it to d5 and control the position, while he will be able to put pressure on the black queenside once he is fully organized. The only thing to watch out for is that Black should not be allowed to create counterplay.
27.Qg2!
After 27.£k3?! Black would be able to push White backwards with 27...Rh4 28.Bg2 Sh3. White still has the better chances after 29.^d5 Bh4 30.Bb3±, but the game has entered a more random phase that might very well include a pawn race towards the end.
27.h3?! also allows Black to solve one of
his problems, the backward pawn on d6.
27...d5! This pawn is immune because of
28.Bxd5 iUi4 or 28.exd5? e4. So White has
to play 28.Nc3 d4 29.Nd5 S4f7 30.Qg2±. Obviously it is still a bit more pleasant to be White, but the change in the pawn structure is a definite improvement for Black.

Black is about to exchange his weak bishop on f8 for Whites bishop on d2 in order to gain control of the f4-square. If Black is successful in this, he will be okay and not suffer too badly from the pressure he is feeling down the half¬ open files. White therefore has to take control of the f4-square urgently.
38.5}gl! Jji6 39.ilxh6 Nxh6 40.N h3

Miskolc (rapid) 2010 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 If White is given time to play Jkf4-e3 and maybe b2-b3, breaking up the strong black pawn chain, he will be clearly better. Black must therefore find an immediate way to make the threat to the bishop on f4 real.
20...6!
The only move - the other options are worse:
20...Sxc5? is quite optimistic, but after

9. Karjakin - Kramnik

[diagram]
Black looks a little worse, mainly because he is not able to make anything out of his dark- squared bishop. You could easily imagine that the evaluation would be entirely different if the bishop was on e5! If we look carefully we will see that Black's only route for the bishop is from e7 to g7 via f8. By energetic play White was able to prevent this.
20.h4!!
A great move for a 14-year-old to play. Maybe he was lucky and just found move 22 when he got there? Probably not; players this great do not rely on luck and neither should you.
20. JUfc 21.h5 g6 22.h6±
Black is left in a very passive situation. Kramnik survived only by a miracle and because of his opponent's youth and inexperience.
10. Razuvaev - Sveshnikov
Moscow 1995
[diagram]
If White were able to complete his development he would be strategically winning. The b6-pawn is fantastic and the c6-pawn is likely to come under a devastating attack.
17.h4!
This prepares the development of the bishop to the obvious square d3 after which White is just much better.
17.<4,d3?! J^h3! would be irritating, and reduce
White's advantage to not very much. There was a serious alternative for White in
17.Jkd4!? Se8 18.^d 1, which looks decidedly
odti, but the white king is not especially exposed. You can believe that 18...^d7 19.<^e2 jkf6 20.Qd2 Nb7 21.Sel
[diagram]
would give White great winning chances. But why have the king on dl, when you can hide it in safety on gl?
17.Nd4 Qe8 18j,e2,Nh3!^
17...d4?!
Now the bishop can come to c4 instead of d3.
17...5.8 18.,S,e2 Nd7 was more normal, but
White has a great advantage. For example:

12. A. Matthiesen - Schandorff
Denmark 2010
[diagram]
The biggest weakness in the black camp is the f7-pawn, which of course can be defended by ...Rf8. But White prevents this defence and wins the game.
23.Jte7!
From this point Black can try a lot of things, but essentially he is outplayed.
23...Qa4
23...Sxdlt 24.Hxdl Se8 25.1d6 is a typical
horror scenario. * After 25...Qxa2 26.h6 MM8 27.Rcl White dominates completely. And after 25...gxh5 26.Rcl Rc8 27.2xc8t Qxc8 28.Ng5 Qe8 the weakness of the h7- square is used to penetrate Black's position.
29.Qe4 f5 30.Qb7 Bh6 31.Nf3 Black is
paralysed and will not survive for long. White is planning d4-d5 and later ?}f3-d4-e6/f5.
24.Sxcl Sxclf 25.Nh2
25...gxh5
25...h6 weakens the light squares and is no
better: 26.hxg6 fxg6 27.Qg4 Nf7 28.1g5! The threat of Qf4t forces Black to make a concession. 28...hxg5 (28...h5 29.Qf4f Ng8
30.jkf6 and the weaknesses are too many)
29.Nxg5t Ne7 30.!fxe6t <Nd8 31.Qg8f Nf8
32.^e6f Ne8 33.Bd3 White wins.

Now Black is murdered on the dark squares.

13. Gasanov - Lastin
Dagomys 2009
[diagram]
The weakness in the black position is the pawn on f7, White's worst-placed piece is probably the bishop on fl and Black's idea is to play ...c5. All this spells only one solution:
20.c5!
20.Qce4 jkf8 21.c5 is too slow. Black has
time to play 21...Qxe4 22.Qxe4 h6, when White has only a slight advantage. Black is completely fine after 20 Jd3 h6!
21.Qce4 kcl 22.Qxf6t Nxf6 23.Qe4 Qxe4
24 Jxe4 jkc8 with more or less even chances.
20...bxc5
This is basically forced, otherwise White plays jkc4.
21.Qce4!
21.jkc4? does not work here because of
tactics: 21...Qelf 22.Ng2 cxd4 23.Qxf7 c5t

25.Qxd6t Qxc4 26.Qxc4 Jbcf3t! 27.Nxf3
Qfit 28.Qf2 Qxc4 29.Qe2 @f7! Black either wins back the piece with an extra pawn, or has a strong attack after 30.Qa4 Qd5t 31 •<^>f2 h5, when the black pawns are very impressive.
21...Qxe4
21..Je7? is even worse; after 22.Qxf6t
Qxf6 23.M,c4 White just wins.
22.Qxe4 JlflB 23.dxc5±
White won a good game on move 37.
14. Leko - Korchnoi
Wijk aan Zee 2000
[diagram]
Black's idea is to play ...Qe4! to simplify the position and immediately solve the problems of his exposed queen. I do not think White
[diagram]
Chapter 3 - Prophylaxis 145 can count on any real pressure in the endgame resulting from this. I4.gfel! Combining development and prophylaxis.
14...Nd7
The only move. A tactical error that comes close to losing the game all on its own.
15...Nb6!? was best, though White can claim a
slight edge with I6.b3, when the knight on b6 is out of play. This is not a great problem for Black of course, but at times all we can hope for is to cause the opponent minor inconvenience. I6.Radl Qc6
[diagram]
17.Rxe6f!
An attractive combination.
17...Qxe6 18.Sxe6 feg5 19.Sxd7 g4
20.Se5!±
The point of the combination - if Black moves or defends the bishop, White will continue with 21.Hg5!. The engines suggest 22...Sdl 23.&fl J^b4
24.c3 "S,d6 as an improvement. After 25.Re4
Bbl 26.Se2± White has good winning chances, though Black can fight with 26...b5!?.
23.Sb5 lb6 24.c4 Sdl 25.&H Scl 26.b3±
White is in control and won the game on move 43.
15. Volokitin - Eljanov
Foros 2008
[diagram]
In this typical Berlin-structure White usually achieves his aims by playing g3-g4, but this time around that is not going to work out. Instead it is Black that is planning to advance on the kingside with ...g5.
29.Nb5?!
White could kill all Black's play on the kingside with 29.h4!. A possible continuation could be 29...b6 30.Nb5 Se8, when I do not see any easy way for White to make progress, but in this rather stale position at least he can manoeuvre with more ease than Black. Although a draw is likely, that is certainly a great improvement on the game. Sometimes we need to avoid losing first of all!
20...Sad8 21.Sxd8 Sxd8 22.&el Ad4 29...g5+ 30.g4?!
Clearly Volokitin was relying on this idea - unfortunately it leads nowhere. 30.Bd8 Sxd8
31.Sxd8 gxf4 32.gxf4 fth4f and ...Ng6 also
leads to an advantage for Black.
30...gxf4 31.^13 Nh4t
It was even more decisive to flick in ...hxg4f first, but Black is on his way to winning the game anyway.
32.<Ne4 b6
Black won on move 48.
16. Van Wely - Wade
London 2008
[diagram]
White has a typical good knight against bad bishop, but he is lacking in targets and Black has decent pressure down the e-file, which occupies one of the white rooks. The only real weakness in the black camp is the g6-pawn, but rather than attacking this immediately, White should use the fact that Black is not planning anything active to improve his position first of all.
25.Nd3!
The knight goes to e5 where it is more active and blocks Blacks counterplay on the e-file. Only after this should White consider active options.
25...6g7
25...b6 26.Eg2 Ng7 27.Ne5 c5 28.bxc5
bxc5 29.Nxf7 *xf7 30.dxc5 favours White.
26.Ne5 Nf6 27.e4!?
It is not necessary to make this active decision yet, but it is not a poor choice either.
27...h6?!
This weakens the black pawn structure unnecessarily Better was 27...Sd8 28.Sdl Bb3 29.Sd3 Be6 when Black is just waiting. White has a slight edge, but will it be enough to win the game?
28.Sg2 Sg8 29.Ne3 ±e6 30.Sh2
Preventing ...g5.
30...5eg7 31.Ecl Sa8 32.Sc5 a6 33.^d3
Having fulfilled its function on e5, the knight returns to f4.
33...6e7 34.^f4lf7
[diagram]
35.e5!?
To me this is a strange decision. Black can be happy that the pressure on his pawn structure is reduced.
35.exf5 gxf5 36.Bxf5 was tempting, although
opening the position up does give Black some activity as well. Chapter 3 - Prophylaxis 147
35...Ne6?
This allows a nice sequence. The more natural 35...g5! was the right move: 36.hxg5 hxg5 37.Qe2 f4f 38.Nf2 Sd8 and Black looks fully okay.
36.d5! Ixd5 37.Nxd5t cxd5 38.Rc7t!
White values activity over material.
38...6ffi 39.Rhc2 Sxc7 40.Sxc7 Se8
4l.Nd4 Se7 42.Sc8t Nf7
42...Se8 43.Sxe8f ^xe8 44.F4! and the
pawn ending is winning for White.
43.f4 Rd7 44.b3
White has serious pressure. Black's best chance is probably 44...h5 followed by passive defence.
44...g5?! 45.hxg5 hxg5 46.fxg5 f4
47.g6t?
Missing a direct win by 47.Sh8 Ng7 48.e6!, based on 48...Se7 49.Sh6! and 48...Sc7
49.Rh4 Ng6 50.Sxf4 Nxg5 51.Sf8, when the
black king is cut off.
47...6xg6?
This loses by force. The last chance was
47...6e6 48.Sf8 Sg7 49.Rf6t Ne7 50.Sb6
Ne8. This looks bad for Black, but only extensive analysis can determine whether it is already too late for him to save the game.

17. Milliet - Collas

Black would solve a lot of her problems if she were allowed to play ...f5.
22.6!
Keeping the knight on the great e4-square.
22...e5
Pure resignation, but Black cannot save her position anyway:
22...exf5 23.Qxf5 Ne3
[diagram]
This was the obvious tactical reaction. Here the consequences of 24.Nxf6f Rxf6! are not as clear as White would like, but she has a more complicated forced win at her disposal:
24.Qh71 Sg4
24...5.g2 loses to 25.ibcf6 "S,xf6 26.Sxf6!
Sxh2t 27.Nxh2 Ng4f 28.<Nh3 Nxf6

25.Qh8t&f7 26.Qxh5t Ne6
26...^f8 27.Jkxf6 and White wins.
27.Sf3 Sxe4
27...Qxe4 28.Sxe3! Qxe3 29.Qd5#
28.Sel
With threats such as Qh3t and Hfxe3, White is winning.
11.O-O-O, but the idea of h4-h5 does not work
so well when time has been invested in placing the pawn on h3 in the first place. The way for White to secure a small plus is by playing:
11.e5!
Preventing Blacks standard plan of playing ...e5 followed by bringing his knight to d4.
11...&C7 12.O-O-O Jte6 13.1xg7 Nxg7
I4.h4h5 15.&bl± White is simply a bit better, although the advantage is nothing spectacular. Still, better is better.
19. De Groote - Ondersteijn
22...d5 was maybe the best chance, but after
23.cxd5 exd5 24.Sac 1 White has a winning
attack all the same.
23.Sadl
White is strategically winning and went on to win the game in 36 moves.
18. Cossin - Collas
Pau 2008
[diagram]
This position is fairly quiet. White could of course consider sharpening it by playing Netherlands 2008

We should never miss ideas as simple as this one. Black has the chance to trap the white king in the corner for a long time.
29...h3! 30.Sc2 &ft6 31.Sc4 b5 32.Scl Ne5
33.Sc2
At this point it is hard to understand why Black refrained from 33...^d4, which would quickly win - perhaps he overlooked that
34.&gl Ne3 is immediately decisive. Instead
he made it all complicated and delayed the victory until move 102. Chapter 3 - Prophylaxis 149
20. Kramnik - Ivanchuk
8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 White's big threat is f3-f4 followed by e4-e5, which could quickly bring Black to his knees. Black is able to reduce the impact of this.

31.e5?!
This move throws away all chances of an advantage.
31.iLc4! Ne7 32.Ab5± is a safe way to retain a
small plus. 31 .g3!? is of course possible, but reveals another point to Blacks last move - the opening of the g-file will let Black show his positions potential: 31...^e8 32.f4?! White should go back to Jkc4-b5 and fight for an edge. 32...gxf4

Although the position is about equal here, Blacks task is easier in the endgame, and he eventually won on move 73.
21. Wells - P. Littlewood
Canterbury 2010 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 We join this game in what I assume is a standard Pete Wells time scramble. White is awfully close to delivering mate, but he fails to take into account Black's defence. The solution is 37.ilf5!!, when there is no good defence against Qe7. The closest Black
[diagram]
has to a defence is 37...Nf7 (37...Se8 38.Qf6 and White wins), but White is winning after
38.jR,e6t Ne8 39.Qg4!, with the threat of
mate in four starting with 40.j^f7t- The game went less successfully for White: 3 7.Qe7??
37.^h2? is also a worse version. After
37...Qf2 38.Bf5 Black can play 38...Re8!= on
account of: 39.Qf6
[diagram]
39...Qg3t'!^
The following long and complicated line is truly breathtaking: 37.ile6t? Qxc6 38.dxe6 Qf2t 39.Nh2 Se8 40.h5 <Nh8! 4l.hxg6 hxg6

perpetual check.
37..Mm 38.Nh2
[diagram]
Here Black gave White extra chances with
38...@f6?! and the game was eventually drawn
on move 59 after further mistakes from both players. I he correct move would have been
38...Qf7!?, defusing all threats to the king.
22. Topalov - Kamsky
Kazan (1.4) 2011
[diagram]
Blacks weakness is obviously his king and the main threat against it is seemingly Qd8-f8#. Black has to defend against this, but must do so intelligently. However, we should check whether the main threat is Chapter 3 - Prophylaxis 151 genuinely threatening! Here @d8 can be met with ...Qc8 and Black is fine. Rather White is really threatening Qdl or d4, both leading to desperate problems for Black. Kamsky defended against both of these, but opened up another avenue of attack for White.
38...N7c6?
The solution is: 38...jkb3!!
[diagram]
The main point of this move is simple. Black wants to be able to meet 39.Jkd4 with
39...Qd3!= without the bishop hanging on a2.
Note that as mentioned above, 39.Qd8 is not a problem; Black has 39...Qc8t forcing the exchange of queens.
38...^bl? is refuted by 39.Qdl!.
39.Qd6! Ne8 40.Nc7t?!
40.^,d4! was stronger. After 40...Qd3
4l.Qf8t Nd7 42.Qxf6

Black is totally lost. For example: 42...Qf3t
43.Bxf3 Qxf3 44.Qf7t Ne7 45.Nf8t Nd8
46.Qxa2! and White wins.
40...6f7 4l.Nd5

23. Sargissian - E. Berg
Rijeka 2010
24. Roiz - Rodshtein
Beersheba (rapid) 2007 White has been playing with his back against the wall for a while and has now decided to put all his hope in the Sa3-g3 manoeuvre. Unfortunately there is a move he did not anticipate:
38...e3!!
A nice pawn sacrifice that improves Blacks coordination.
39.J,xe3
The main point is of course that after
39.Rxe3 Sxd4 40.Hg3 Rg4 Black is able to
block the pin and win the game.
39.Jlc3 e2 is equally hopeless, even though the
game would continue for a bit longer.
39..Jfxfi6 40.1f4 Bf7
White resigned. I am sure that there are those that would have put this position in the Calculation book in the section on Intermediate Moves, but this only underlines the fact that often there are many ways to solve a chess problem and that the definitions are only useful to us as ways to organize our thinking. 0-1
[diagram]
White is on top. He has a fantastic knight on d6 and the black pieces are almost as poorly placed as they could be. However, even winning positions need to be won. In this case there are two easy ways arrive at the solution. The first is to aim to restrict Black's play. Black would like to get his knight into play - he wants to play ...a5, ...Qc7 and ...Na6, when he would be fine, the knight soon making it to d5. White can of course prevent this plan. The other way to find the right move is to focus on penetrating along the b-file. In the game White did not find the right way to do this, playing 24.Sdbl?, and after
24...a5!± Black was suddenly in with a shout. It
should be mentioned that Black actually made a strong comeback and even won the game some 60 moves later. If White had looked for a way to take this resource away from Black, he would have found the right move as well. The correct move is of course 24.a5I, when Black is completely paralysed and will lose material quite soon. Chapter 4 Exercises In this chapter you will find 150 exercises with a positional slant. In all of them it will make sense to ask the three questions to direct your focus and to make sure you do not rush into assumptions. You will find all sorts of positions here, but all of them are to some extent simple, even though in some cases strong grandmasters got them wrong, either over the board or when trying to solve them in training sessions that I have organized. But as always, chess is simple to understand, just as music is. But that does not mean that you can listen to a tune, hum it and then just sit down and play it on the piano. Chess is about skill; it is about practice more than it is about understanding, although of course understanding is needed as well. How often have we heard our friends complaining about losing to someone who "understood nothing"? I am as guilty of uttering those words as anyone else. But in the end it is the strength of the moves we play that matters. It is for this reason I hope that you will go through these 150 exercises seriously. Aim to solve them all, of course, but also train yourself in making decisions. If your rating is above 2200, do not invest more than 10 minutes in a position; if your rating is below 2200, make it 15 minutes. If you like to challenge yourself, take 35 minutes to solve 6 exercises. (First look quickly at them, to see if you can pin one or two of them down quickly.) If your rating is below 2200, make it 45 minutes. If you want a suggested training plan, I would propose that you do six pages of exercises a week, allowing yourself one day of rest. This means it will take you a month to go through this section. If you follow the training program and ask the three questions religiously, you will arrive at the other end with a transformed intuition and feeling for positional play.

abcdefgh abcdefgh Chapter 5 Solutions When John Shaw and I were putting together the Quality Chess Puzzle Book (available on our website!), we looked through the fifty or so books on tactics that we have in the company library In the end we decided that the best way to present the solutions to the puzzles was to have them overleaf. We used this system again in Chess Tactics from Scratch and Grandmaster Preparation - Calculation. It is by far my favourite way of presenting the solutions, but it requires that they are relatively short; or that you have fewer than six puzzles on each page. If you have very long solutions, which tends to happen when things are complicated, then you may be able to fit six solutions over two to three pages, as I did in the last of the works mentioned above. But once you have solutions that are more than a full page long, this system more or less collapses. So in this book we have returned to a less ideal system, which is however practicable. In the previous chapter you had the exercises; in this one you have the solutions. I suggest that you find an additional bookmark! In some of the diagrams in this chapter I have added a few graphics to show my approach to the positions. They illustrate what I think is important. They should not be seen as the final say, only as gentle guidance. The same is the case with the solutions. In the process of selecting the 222 exercises for this book, I have been through far more than a thousand potential positions, which I initially believed would make good exercises; but many turned out to be unconvincing and simply unsuitable as exercises. This does not mean that I am necessarily right in all cases. There will be positions where there is more than one way to play. I have indicated what I think is the best way to play and put in a lot of work to make sure that I am right. But some people might disagree with me. That is no problem; I would just advise you to consider the arguments for my solution. You may even find that you disagree with me quite often, but again this is not a problem, as long as you objectively analyse the position. I hope you have enjoyed the exercises and solved more than you believed possible!
1. Wislez - Tiviakov
Eupen 2000
[diagram]
It should be quite obvious that Black has done okay out of the opening. White is not about to launch an offensive anywhere, and he has some pawn weaknesses on the queenside. However, Black also needs to form a plan to seize the initiative. The way to play this position is to realize that White has a weak square on c4 along with the weak pawns on a3 and b4, and that the knight on a6 is out of play and could do much better. By transferring this knight to c4, Black makes Whites existence very difficult.
14...Nc7! 15.e3 Ne8 I6.1fe2 Nd6 17.Sfcl
5Bc4+ Black is better, but White has played sensibly, so he retains drawing chances.
18.1el!
The bishop is bad in the short term, but later in the game can become active again. White realizes that although it looks poor at the moment, the bishop is protecting important squares.
18...5c7
The rook on f8 is inactive and needs to join in; I see no other way of doing this.
19.Qa2
19.a4!? was a worthy option, though after
19...a6! Black is still slightly better.

Black has made advances against White's stubborn defence. It is likely that there are small improvements for both players along the way, but the general impression is that Black has outplayed his lower-rated opponent.
31.h4
White had to give up a pawn with 31.^a6
[diagram]
Chapter 5 - Solutions 181 Qb6 32.Nc5 in order to hold the a3-pawn. Although the two bishops will offer some compensation, it is not likely to be enough.

2. V. Kovacevic - Pinter
Plovdiv 1983
[diagram]
The weakest point in the black position must be the f6-square, though one could argue for the f7-pawn to be included on the list of weaknesses. Black also has a traditional bad bishop on d7 and a misplaced queen on b6. His main ideas are to play ...f5 or ...dxe4, in both cases solving some of the problems with his pawn structure as well as aiming to activate the bishop. White wants to find something for his knights to do, as well as keep his advantages. For this reason the correct move is to advance the e-pawn.
18.e5! 6?
After this move White's advantage is obvious, as his pieces flow easily to e5 and other attractive squares. I was more interested in what would have happened had Black decided to play on the queenside, where he is stronger. The best move is:
18..Jfd8!
Besides clearing the way for the b-pawn, the queen is ready to come to g5 and h4 in many lines involving the thrust f2-f4. It took us some time to work out the correct plan for White to prove an advantage, and even after this work, it feels as if the resources of the position have by no means been exhausted. The following is certainly not something you would need to see in order to solve the original problem, but it is very interesting and instructive. 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1
19.Ng4!
After trying various plans, we decided to rely on this one, which tries to make use of the poorly placed knight in an active capacity. This is a rather slow plan, but White has a head start on the kingside, so he can afford the slow manoeuvring.
19...b5
The most natural move. It turns out that 19...5^f5 is premature. Rather than being active on f5, the knight is a target there. White plays 20.Rfel b5
21.^fl b4 22.^fe3± and now Black is in a
tight squeeze. Either he allows White to take on f5 and play ^e3, which is very dangerous for him, or he exchanges the knights,
[diagram]
allowing White to start an attack on the kingside: 22...^xe3 23.Rxe3 Sb8 24.Sf3! bxc3 25.bxc3 @b6 It might look as if Black will be just in time with ...Qb2, but the counterplay fails to a nice tactic: 26Jbcf7t!! Sxf7 27.Qg6 Rxf3 28.^f6f+- 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1
20.a3!!
This deep move was found by John Shaw. The idea was at first to make Black play ...a5 to support the advance of the b-pawn, because ...Qa5 had been irritating us in several lines. Analysis then suggested other, unforeseen advantages of this move.
20.Sfel b4! turns out to give Black enough
counterplay. After 21 .^fl Sb8 22.Nfe3 ^c6
23.2fl Nh8! it is not easy to make progress
with White. The last move is important because of these jbcf7t combinations which keep popping up all over the place.
20...a5 21 .Bfel Nh8
The immediate push on the queenside falls prey to another tactic. After 21...b4 22.axb4 axb4 23.ftf6| ibcf6 24.Bxa8 Qxa8 25.exf6 Whites advantage is obvious. Black has several ways to play, but none of them satisfactory. The key point is that he cannot play 25...^c6
26.ftf3 Qd8, which would otherwise be
the logical thing to do, as White once again wins with: 27Jbcf7t!l Rxf7 28.Qg6t Nf8
29.1fxh6t Ne8 30.Qh8t SflB 31.Qh5t W
32.ftxg5 Qxf6 33.£"xf7 Qxf7 34.Qxd5! and

22.Nfl b4 23.&fe3±
[diagram]
White has an edge. He is intending to play Sfl and f2-f4 with action on the kingside. There is still a lot to play for, but the general outlook for Black is not great. Here is one possible line:
23...5b8
23...bxc3 24.bxc3 Sb8 would allow White
to play 25.Sabl!±. White can successfully challenge Black for the b-file, because the possibility of jumping in with Nf6 keeps the black queen occupied on the kingside.
24.axb4 axb4 25.f4 gxf4 26.gxf4 ftc6 27.f5±
White's idea is that Black cannot play:
27...Qg5? 28.f6 Qxh5 29.6cg7t Nxg7 30.Nf6
And the bishop on d7 hangs.

3. Leko - Ivanchuk
Morelia/Linares 2006
[diagram]
By employing a short-term tactical threat, White manages to create a great square for his knight on c4.
21.c4!±
Black does not have time to play 21...b4, as the e-pawn is hanging.
21..JU6 22j,a5!?
I like this move a lot. White is intending to exchange his so-called good bishop for the apparently very poor knight on d8. However, in only two moves the knight can be on d4, whereas the bishop has no real targets in the long term. It was of course also possible to play 22.cxb5. After 22.. Jbcb5 I rather like the idea 23.^f5!?±, although it is by no means the only good move in the position. I especially like the tactical justification for this move, which is that 23...Jbcd3? loses to a line involving a beautiful desperado: 24.j^a5 Qb8 25.Qdl c4 26.jbcc4 jbcc4 27.Nxd6 Bb3! 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1

24.Sbl!
Black is losing a pawn and his pawn structure is in ruins, so Ivanchuk decided it was not even worth trying to defend his position for another moment. 1-0
4. Leko - Mamedyarov
Wijk aan Zee 2006
[diagram]
The weaknesses in the black position are all on the queenside, and the advantage of the white position naturally has to do with the two bishops, especially the one on b3. However, at the moment this piece is a bit passive.
15.a5!=
This move fulfils two objectives. It brings the bishop to c6, from where it will disrupt Blacks coordination, and it splits the black pawns on the queenside into effectively three pawn islands, all of them vulnerable.
15...Nc5 l6.1a4Sb8
Black cannot take the bishop. After
16...6xa4 17.Sxa4 Sb8 18.Qd3 Sb5 19.Bd2
it is not easy for him to hold on to his pawns.
17.Ac6
17...Ng5!?± was another plan.
18.Qe2Bd4 19.Sbl Qf620.Sdl h62lJfd2
White could consider 21.g3!?± or 21.h3!?±.
21...Sfe8?
This exchange sacrifice does not make a lot of sense. 21...Ac3 22.Qe2 jkd4 was necessary, when White would have to come up with an active plan to make progress.

White is of course better. He has won a pawn and has no great problems beyond the doubled pawns on the g-file, which can hardly be called weak. However, his position is not entirely stable. Black is about to play ...Rc2 and ...Sac8, creating counterplay against the b2-pawn and on the second rank in general. It is important for White to first minimize this counterplay, before he thinks about how to convert his advantage.
25.±d2!
Chapter 5 - Solutions 185 And this is the way to do it. Once the bishop is on c3, it will achieve the double whammy of blocking the c-file and stabilizing the position.
25...Sc2
Black has to get the rook into the white position before it is too late.
26.ilc3 27.Sd2 Sc8 28.Sadl Ne7
29.&£2 Sc4 30.Ne3
White has made it through the first stage; the position is completely stabilized. He can now look for ways to convert his advantage.
[diagram]
30...1f5 31.Shl g6
In opposite-coloured bishop endings it is common for the player without ambitions to put his pawns on the same-coloured squares as his bishop, as this makes them easy to defend, though impossible to advance. For the player wanting to win, the opposite is usually the case. He will try to challenge the opponent's bishop and seek to advance his pawns, so he has to fight for the squares that his own bishop does not control.
32.Sh4
White offers an exchange of rooks, which is attractive to Black, but also unravels Whites doubled pawns.
32...Sxh4 33.gxh4 a6 34.Nd4 Nd7 35.Nc5
Nc7 36.a4 Black is almost in zugzwang. He could exchange rooks on d2, but probably felt that his chances to draw this ending would be slim. White can aim to obtain a passed pawn on b6. Then he will put his king on g5 or f6 and play g2-g4. This will either create a weakness on h5, or it will force Black to play ...hxg4, when after fxg4, White is ready to advance the h-pawn to create a second passed pawn and claim the bishop for it. From a practical point of view, this ending did not attract Shirov, but maybe it was the best chance.
[diagram]
36...Scl?
Black should have played 36...Hxd2
37.ibcd2 RLd7U making it very difficult for
White to advance his b-pawn. Remember, if White plays 38.a5? Black can always defend his queenside with the bishop on the b5- fl diagonal, and the king can rush to the kingside and prevent any concessions there. White can try 38.^b4!?, but after 38...<£^6
39.Be3t Nc6 40.*a5 Nd5 4l.b3 Bc8 the
game is sharper than White would want it to be. Although it is obvious that it is White who is trying to win here, I think Black should draw. This does not necessarily mean that White has done anything wrong up to this point, or that the initial evaluation needs to be revised. To be better simply means that if you make a small mistake, or if the opponent defends perfectly, the game is likely to revert to equilibrium. And to be worse simply means that you have to defend well not to lose, that the margin for error is limited. In this game Shirov did not defend perfectly. I believe that this move was the critical mistake, but these endings are very difficult to understand, so I shall not feign certainty.
37.g4!
White is now able to free himself of all the issues haunting him, as they all involved the d-pawn.
37...hxg4 38.fxg4 Jtxg4
38...^,e4? 39.Rf2 would not work out for
Black.
39.Sxd3±

39...Shl
39...^.d7!? might have been a better defence.
40.1a5t! Nb7
After 40...Nc8 4l.Sd4! Rxh4, White can transpose to the game with 42.Bc3 g5 43.J,el, but maybe he could find something even more convincing? 4l.Sb3t Nc8 42.Sb4 Sxh4
42...jke6± was better. The game would still
be difficult for Black, but maybe not yet lost.

6. Onischuk-Jakovenko
Foros 2008
[diagram]
White wants to play b2-b4, clamping down on the c6-pawn and leaving the bishop on b7 stuck. Black therefore has to calculate the freeing move, and look for a way to make it work.
16...c5! 17.Nxf6t
The only move. The great trick is that

[diagram]
19.c5!
The point of this move is that White is active in the centre. He would of course like to open it without shedding material, but this is not an option. Instead he offers this pawn in order to destroy the opponents pawn structure.
19...il,xe2
19...dxc5? 20.cS.xa6 Qxa6 21.dxe5 would be
a disaster for Black. After the exchanges on e5 White would play ^a4xc5-d7, winning the exchange.
20.Sxe2 dxc5 21.dxe5 fxe5 22.Sed2 Sb7
8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 Up to this point White has managed to change the position through his aggressive positional operation and now he had to find a way to exploit the weaknesses created in the black position. He did not do a great job of this in the game; after 23.Sc4?! Nb6 his advantage was minimal. A better option would have been 23.h4! (or 23.^d3 first, as the mysterious computer suggests). The big positional threat is ^g5, which would undermine the defence of the d6-square. This encourages Black to play
23..."S.h6, but after 24.Hd3± he is badly
coordinated. White will play ^f3-d2-c4, or h4-h5 and after ...gxh5 then 5^f3-h4-f5, in both cases with a big advantage.

8. Gelfand - Morozevich
8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 White decided to repeat the position with
13.J,cl? V2-V2, being unable to find any
reasonable way to continue the game. Had he spent time thinking about activating his worst piece, the rook an hi, he might have come upon the solution:
13.H4!!
This move, originally suggested by Sergey Shipov, seems to be more or less winning by force.
13...d5
13...ibcd4 l4.Hh3 Qxa4 15.Qxa4 jbcal
16.Sb3 and Black cannot defend the queenside.
14.e5 e6 15.Sbl Qe7 16.cxd5 exd5 17.ild3
Whites initiative should be decisive. Black cannot easily get his bits out, and White is attacking on both flanks with a fully mobilized army. Obviously the game has a long way to go, and Black does have an extra pawn, but the chances are still entirely with White at this stage. Moscow 2008
[diagram]
9. Hammes - Akopian
8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 The position seems relatively quiet and Blacks next move might seem obvious to most, as I am sure it was to Akopian. However, we might not necessarily be talking about the same move. The solution to this position is the move that combines the necessary defensive obligations (avoiding mate in one) and active possibilities.
15...6!
The reason some might hold back from this move is that it weakens the e6- pawn. However, that is not relevant in this position. After the advance of the f-pawn, the black king is absolutely safe and White is likely to have to play a more defensive role than he would wish, due to the weakness of the d4-pawn. The other automatic move was 15...h6?!. After
16.O-O the position is roughly balanced, but
it would be Black who had to play accurately over the next ten moves.
16.O-O
This aggression on the kingside is of course very attractive, but it was not the only way Kallithea 2008
[diagram]
Chapter 5 - Solutions 189 to play the position. Black could also have improved his standing in the centre first, by ...Rc8 or by rerouting the d7-knight.
[diagram]
17.1d2
White is struggling for a plan and thus falls down quickly. The idea of this move is to prevent ...Sh6, but in itself that might not be devastating. He should of course avoid automatic moves such as 17.Radl?, because after 17...Sh6
18.Qe3 Qh4 19.Qg3 Sg6! Black is already
winning.
17.Bfel also looks a bit suspicious. Black
plays 17...Sg6 18.^fl Qg5 followed by ...Sf8, ...ftf6 or ...f4, with a terrible attack. The best option might be to play 17.Qe3!? to bring the queen into the game. Black would of course have options such as the most flexible
17...Rh6, and 17...f4!? 18.Qd2 f3, in both
cases with an initiative for Black. However, I do not see why White should not be able to hold his position together.
17...5g6 18.B Nb8
A very natural regrouping of the knight. However, the more creative 18...^b7!? was worth considering. The main ideas are ...^c5! or ...Ne5!?, though playing ...Nf6-d5 also becomes an option. The thinking behind the retreat is that the bishop is less useful on d5 once White has closed the long diagonal, whereas a knight on that square may demonstrate that f2-f3 has compromised the white position.
19.Sacl?
This simply blunders a pawn. After the correct 19.^,e3 £\c6 20.Sadi the position remains complex. I would consider Black's chances to be slightly better and his position easier to play, with ideas such as ...@f6, ...Hc8 and ...Qa5. But with accurate play, there is no doubt that White will be able to neutralize this slight pull.
19...Nc6
White cannot easily defend the d-pawn.

10. Adly - Sebag
Hoogeveen 2008
[diagram]
The bishop on b7 looks good, as bishops on long diagonals usually do. However, because of the way the game has evolved, there is nothing of great importance on that diagonal; it is all on the other long diagonal. Black realized this and exchanged the "good" light-squared bishop for the great dark-squared diagonal.
17...ilxS! 18.1x6 Be5!
The bishop is obviously immune, and now combines defending the black kingside with attacking the white queenside. The position is essentially winning.
[diagram]
19.Qc4 hxg5 20.hxg5
After 20.Bxg5 Black can take it easy with
20...^,f6! 21.Sg4 a5 with a distinct positional
advantage. This might very well be the best option. However, she can also go for concrete action with: 20...jbcb2!? 21.Hbl jkf6 22.Sxb4 Hxh4! (22...Qd6 23.Qb5t Ne7 24.Sgg4 Shd8
25.Rbd4!? is better for Black, but seems
unnecessarily complicated.) 23.Rg4 Hxg4
24.jbcg4 Qd6 and Black is a pawn up with a
safer king. Although the position may not be completely winning, it can be said to be close.
20...a5 21.g6
The best way to fight back was: 21.a3! jtxb2 (21...b3 22.jkc3 would do a lot to relieve the pressure on White's position, although there would still be some problems to solve along the way.) 22.axb4! jbcal 23.bxc5 Qblt 24.jkdl Jke5 Black is decidedly better, but White has serious prospects for counterplay, both through the passed pawn and against the open black king. We can see the reason for the exchange sacrifice - the knight was invaluable in defence.

21...fi6?!
After this Black keeps a good position, but White still has some counterplay. Instead she should have played fearlessly with 21...O-O!, Chapter 5 - Solutions 191 when Blacks lead in development is very important, and the risk of getting mated on the kingside is minor. 22.jke2 (22.jkh5 f5

White has not achieved an attacking stance on the kingside and has no pressure in the centre. It is quite clear that Black has no problems, but he too has no direct way to launch an attack. However, he can ensure himself the long-term advantage of the two bishops by simple means.

It looks as if White is playing on the queenside with his doubled rooks, but the only real weakness in the black position is the hook created by the h6-pawn. White should therefore play on the kingside and only use his threats on the queenside to sidetrack his opponent.

Chapter 5 - Solutions 199
20.1xc5!
After 20.ibcg7 Nxg7 21.Sbl Whites advantage would have been minimal. The d6- pawn is a bit weak, but Black's knight on c5 is strong, so he would not fear this development greatly.
20...dxc5 21.Sbl±
White's advantage is maybe not earth- shattering, but if we look at all of the elements individually, we can see that the black position is quite unpleasant. First of all, he has three weak pawns on the queenside, which are all unable to improve themselves greatly. White may consider Nb3 with an attack on the c5- pawn and there will be no convenient way to defend it. Then there is the bishop currently on b7. Although it can be activated, this will take time and simultaneously leave the c6-pawn more exposed. Finally, what should have been an asset for Black, the g7-bishop, is shooting into a complete void. There is nothing of interest to anyone on the al-h8 diagonal. The game is simply decided elsewhere.

positional reasons. Here White may be able to put Black under a small degree of pressure with I4.dxc6 bxc6 15.^el, when Black has to organize the defence of the d6-pawn.This would be acceptable to Black, as long as White cannot just take on d6. Indeed, this would be ill-advised, as after
15.Sxd6?! £}cxe4 I6.4^xe4 £}xe4 17.Bxc6
Black has the nice blow 17...^xf2!, when the position becomes very sharp and complicated - and probably also slightly favourable for Black. The e-pawn looks very strong and all the black pieces are coming to life quite effortlessly.
14.Nb5! dxe4?!
Black's best chance was probably I4...d4
15.^c7 Sb8 16.^xe8 ^xe8, when he does not
have enough compensation for the exchange, but the closed nature of the position would make it tough for White to convert his plus in practice.
15.Ng5!

Black can still avoid losing the exchange here, but White will be only too happy to take on d6 and e4 and play <i,cl-a3 with all kinds of threats.

23. Bosboom - Timmerman
Netherlands 1992
[diagram]
Coming from a Leningrad Dutch, we have a very fluid pawn structure in the centre, which can be transformed at any moment. Black's structure is slightly weakened on the dark squares, and it is underpinned mainly by the queen and is under some pressure from the white pieces. White managed to secure himself an edge by undermining the defence of the e5-pawn.
13.c5!=
White needed to take some action in order to claim anything significant. After 13.Bfel Black would play 13...exd4 I4.^xd4 fxe4 15.^xe4 Qxe4 l6.Sxe4 Sxe4 17.Qxe4 Qf7 followed by ...^c5, when he would have nothing to fear. Chapter 5 - Solutions 201 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1
13...4i}xe4?
Not the most successful decision, but Black's position was under a lot of pressure. The necessary evil was 13...dxc5, when I4.dxc5 Qe7 might not be too bad for Black. White would instead opt for I4.dxe5 <5}xe4 (I4...^g4 15.Nc4 is good for White too) 15.^xe4 fxe4 I6.Qxe4 jke6 17.Qe3± with a firm grip on the centre. The position is still quite dynamic, but White's structural advantage cannot be denied. I4.^xe4 fxe4 15.cxd6 Qxd6 I6.^xe5 White wins a pawn and on move 41 he also won the game.
24. Ponomariov - Kramnik
[diagram]
Wijk aan Zee 2003
[diagram]
This is a simple question of good pieces and bad pieces. The bishop on d2 is not very useful and the bishop on d6 is rather decent. An exchange of the two is in White's favour.
16.1b4!±
It is of course important to work out that
16...c5? 17.dxc5 bxc5 18.,S,el± is undesirable
for Black. White will play Nc3 and Qb3, when the pressure against the black centre will be very unpleasant.
16...jbcb4 17.axb4 would benefit White. The
doubling of the pawns is not a great problem, but the pressure down the a- and c-files would be a permanent nuisance for Black.
17.Nc3
Another interesting approach would be
17.Nf4!?, when Black might consider 17...c5
18.dxc5 Jbcc5, although White is obviously to be
preferred after a simple move such as 19.Qb3=.
17...^xc3 18.1ofxc3
Ponomariov is quite happy to head for a rather stale technical position. Taking with the pawn in order to play c3-c4 was a serious alternative.

Sfc8 22.a5! Creating further weaknesses in the black camp by opening the a-file.

22...±a6
22...c5? is simply not possible. White would
win by force with 23.bxc5 bxc5 24.Qa3!, when ideas such as e3-e4 will come in many variations. Ponomariov gave 24...Qf8 as a Black try, as well as the refutation: 25.dxc5 Sxc5 26.Rxc5 Sxc5 (26...Qxc5 27.Qb3! and White wins a pawn) 27.Qb3 Qa8 28.e4! Exploiting potential back-rank problems. Now after 28...Sxa5 he only considered taking the pawn on d5, which is very strong, but simpler is 29.Hbl! and White just wins a piece.

Kemer 2011
[diagram]
In positions with compensation for a material deficit, it is often a great advantage for the player who has given up material to have opposite-coloured bishops. This position is no exception. Black is doing well on the dark squares, but still needs to find a way to activate his bishop. This is achieved with a standard pawn sacrifice.
37...e4!
Black's position is generally excellent and so other moves, such as 37...Sa2 or 37...^g7, would win as well. But these moves are really just delaying the main idea of ...e4, which should definitely be played at some point.
38.fre4
White has to take the pawn to prevent it becoming a decisive factor: 38.Qd2 e3 39.Qe2 jkd4 and it is time to resign.

Black is under pressure and needs to find a way to deal with it. If he does so successfully, then White will have to force a draw quickly before his initiative evaporates and he finds himself in an ending a pawn down.
20...A5?
This passive move immediately runs into great difficulties. After 20...a5?! 21 .f5 Sa6 22.gc3t Nb8 23.ifl Sb6 24.Rc5± Black should probably be able to hold the position with decent play, but it is inconvenient and holds certain risks. Certainly this should be avoided.
20...f5!
8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 The difference to the game is that White does not get full control over the d5-square and the freedom to swing the bishop around. Another structural point is that the f4-pawn is fixed as a weakness. This might sound irrelevant when we are in a defensive position, but it is not so. We should always aim to create weaknesses in our opponent's position; even for defensive purposes. After 21.gxf5 exf5 White should already think about repeating the position with 22.Sc3t Nb8 23.Bcd3. Notice that
22.j^el does not work this time around, as the
bishop needs to hold on to the f-pawn.

27. Karpov - Anand
Leon Man+Computer (5) 1999

The centre is stable and White has no active plans on the queenside. It is therefore logical that Black should start an offensive on the kingside, where he has more influence and a chance to include more pieces in the attack.
35...g5!
This weakens both players' king positions, but only Black can bring pieces quickly to the kingside. When this match was played, the computers did not appreciate this move - today they do.
36.hxg5 Qxg5 37.^6 Qg4 38.Qcl
White is not seriously bothered about the prospect of losing the exchange. Why should he be? Anything to support the dark squares would offer him some chances to resist.
38...6RS
Black prepares ...h5-h4, further opening the kingside.

28. Zhu Chen - Korchnoi
Marbella 1999
[diagram]
White has a number of things going for her. She has the two bishops, pressure against the black king and open files for her rooks. Black has to deal with all of these as well as finding an orderly way to complete his development. It transpires that all he has to do is to exchange queens, after which White will have no targets (as the black king is then fully safe) and is left with a poor structure with weak pawns and an inactive bishop on g2.

Dresden (ol) 2008
[diagram]
White practically never takes the knight on c5 in the King's Indian, even though it doubles Black's pawns. Basically the control over the dark squares is more important and Black's dark-squared bishop is liable to become good in the long run. However, this position is an exception because White is able to push his pawn to d6 and obtain a fantastic square on d5 for his knight. Even if it is taken, a lot of light squares will remain weak in the black position.

White has a lead in development, but in principle Black has a better structure. Should Black get all his pieces into play there is a good chance that he would equalize without too much trouble.

A horrible move by an otherwise very strong grandmaster. This knight is Blacks best piece and he should never allow White to get rid of it. The weakness in the white position was definitely the light squares and the removal of the knight makes protecting them quite a bit easier. Of the light squares, it is the d3-square that is weakest of them all. For this reason, Black should have taken the chance to play
26...Nb2!+.

The threats of ...^d3 and ...^,d3 are very real. If Black wins back the exchange then material will be equal, but Black will then enjoy his better pawn structure and the chances he has on the kingside by advancing the pawns there.

White could have won immediately with 34.g4!, when there is no way for Black to deal with the further advance of the g-pawn. For example: 34...h6 35.h4 g5 36.hxg5 hxg5 37.Qf5 and Black loses something big.
34...Qxc5 35.Nd3
White has an extra pawn and should still win with optimal play. But this is hardly ever what happens and in this game White made additional mistakes and had to console herself with a half point after 140 moves.

White is obviously threatening £}f6f. Black needs to decide how to deal with this. As it forks the whole family there are really only two possible moves. If this was a book on calculation I would put this exercise under Elimination, which is another way of saying "Pay attention to your opponent's ideas." Black apparently did not do so in this game and was quickly taken down.
26...1g7?
26..Jke7! was the right move. The position
would be quite unclear, with both players needing to be careful. This is illustrated by the following "natural" moves by White, which lead straight to a 0-1 result: 27.^f6t?! ikxf6
28.Qxf6? Se6 and the e-pawn is lost.
27.1h6!
White wins material as Black has to contend with both Nf6f and Nd6, and she cannot defend against both.

Not the best move, but Black should lose no matter what. Chapter 5 - Solutions 215

Here White incorrectly assumed that Black did not have any good positional ideas and that for this reason there was time to improve the position of the king.
17.&bl?!
Actually this was the first independent move out of preparation. During the game I considered what would happen after the fairly natural 17.Qxc6! j^xc6 18.ikd4. I believed that Black should play something like 18...f6, but in fact it is stronger to play 18...^f3!? with a sharp position with even chances. The main point is 19.Jke2 jkd6 20.jke3 Jkd5 and Black is certainly not worse - but neither is White.
17...fcb4!l
Suddenly it is obvious that Black did have a plan and that after ...£}d5 he will have the advantage.

18.Nb3?
The second move out of preparation is also a mistake. I believe that I did play a lot of good moves in the remainder of this event, but this was horrible.

Another deeply unpleasant move to face, and from here on it just got worse until I managed to set a great trap for my opponent and steal half a point from him on move 49.

44. Pavasovic - S. Atalik
Valjevo 2007
[diagram]
Unless something happens, White will have quite a clear advantage due to his better structure. Blacks c-pawns are permanently weak and White's presence in the centre is powerful. But this is all static thinking. If we look at the dynamics, we can see White is struggling a bit with his development. Usually this would encourage Black to attack, but it is quite limited what he can do - he lacks targets and active pieces. Surprisingly, matters look better for Black the moment he forces the exchange of queens.
15...Qf3! 16.Qxf5
I6.Qd2? would be a desirable move, were it not for the reply I6...Qe4f, winning something.
16...11xc3t 17.bxc3 Jlxf5
The dust has cleared and we can see clear improvements for Black. The c-pawns are still weak, but it is now very difficult to attack Chapter 5 - Solutions 217 them. Black can instead get some benefits from the open files, especially the b-file, where Black is controlling White's entry square. 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1

Campinas 201 1

Black has an excellent chance to take control of the dark squares in the white position by exchanging the dark-squared bishops. Of course the c8-bishop is not a strong piece, but the fl-bishop is even worse. This combined with the weakening of the e3- square makes this operation highly desirable for Black.
13...1.4! I4.Qxb4
This loses a lot of control over the dark squares. But modest play has its problems too: I4.jkc3 Jbcc3 15.Qxc3 Be8t 16.J,e2 If White were given a couple of moves to complete his development he would be happy, but he is suffering after both 16...Qd6!? and

If it were White's move, he would play Qd2, followed by c3-c4 and Nc3 with a slight edge. Instead Black is able to undermine the white centre with a powerful punch.
12...B!
A sharp move that undermines the d5-pawn. White is suffering somewhat from the missing bishop syndrome. The fact that he has not yet fully developed the queenside exacerbates his problems.
13.exf5
White has a difficult choice here. In the game he hoped to get some counterplay on the light squares, but with the knight on c7 so strongly in charge of them, this proved difficult.
13.ikcl fxe4 l4.Hxe4 also runs into trouble
after I4...g5!. Black's idea is ...Nf6, and his intention is to meet 15.c4 with 15...b5! I6.cxb5 ftf6, when White is probably a little bit worse.

There are many factors that can cloud our minds when we sit at the board. I felt that I had done okay out of the opening and I really wanted to win the game, but these are just emotions. In reality the position is just edging on being worse for Black after something like 21 ...Qa8. But I completely blew it in the game:
21...e5??
A grave mistake, from which Black will not recover. I was vaguely aware of this, but being in poor shape and wishing that I could somehow get some activity was stronger than rational thinking when it came to making a decision. Not unfairly, I was crushed.
21...d5! was the correct move: 22.exd5 ^xd5

Whites advantage might not seem like a lot, but Black is always going to find life difficult with a bad bishop against a decent knight.

White no longer has a direct win, although he won on move 36 anyway.
65. Gheorghiu - Joita
Romania 1972
[diagram]
Black's idea is evidently ...d6 to let the bishop into the game.
18.d6!
18.^g4? is very tempting, as Black has only
one move to survive. For example, 18...d6?
19.^f6t *d8 20Jfh6! or 18...Qf3 19.Qxg5,
in both cases with a ravenous attack. But Black can defend with 18...b6!!.
[diagram]
The position is just wildly unclear after something like 19.Qh6!?. The main point is of course that White does not win quickly with 19.^f6t ^d8 20.@h6 (20.Qxg5? would be winning if Black did not have 20...^6+ creating space for the king)
20...5e8 21.^xe8 on account of 21..J^a6,
when it would be sensible for White to force a draw with 22.Qxg5t Nxe8 23.Qg8f Ne7
24.ffg5t.
18...cxd6
18...Qe4 was perhaps the best try. Still,
White's attack is enduring. 19.Qxg5 leaves Black with no ideas other than 19...Qbit
20.^e2 f6. Here White forces an advantage
with 21.Qh5t <^8 22.^d3 Qb6 (22...cxd6
23.Rb2 Qal 24.Qh6 <Ne7 25.Bg2 with the
idea of jkd5 leaves Black defenceless.) 23.f4 cxd6 24.Qxh7, when White should win the game. Black is nowhere near to getting his pieces into the game; White will have plenty of time to generate threats before this happens.
19.^c4
Obviously it is the knight which heads to d6.
19.Sxd6? Qe4! would generate counterplay for
Black. Checks on bl and b4 should secure a draw.

If Black were given all the time in the world he would play ...@c5 and ...£}d7-b6-c4 (maybe with ...b7-b5 included) with a great game. The problem is that White can fight this set-up of the black knights by taking control of their two ideal squares, c4 and d5, with some simple moves.
20.c4!
The apparent weakening of the king's position is an illusion. Black is not able to use it in any way. Even if he were given time to play ...a6 and ...b5, the white king would not face serious threats for many moves to come. Meanwhile White would have time for g2- g4-g5 and so on.
20.g4 would allow Black to fight for the
important squares with 20...Qc5! 21.c3 f6.
[diagram]
White may have the easier play, but he has no clear way to continue his attack quickly, on account of 22.f4?! e5! 23.^b3 Qc6t, energizing the black pieces.
20...&5b6?!
20...5^5f6± was probably more prudent.
Here White can choose to consolidate his position first with 2lJkcl! or go on the immediate attack with: 21.g4!? 9c5 22.g5 Qxd4 (22...hxg5?! is weaker because of
23.ibcg5 Qxc4 24.Qf3 with threats of h5-h6

All of White's dreams of counterplay are associated with a break on the light squares on the kingside. This means that Black should fight for the control of e6/f5/g4 immediately.
16...1c8!
The position has changed since the bishop was developed on b7 - it no longer has a function there and so returns to c8. Other options are weaker:
16...O-O?! 17.^,d2 prepares an opening of the

for White.
17.g3lB
17...a5! seems to be more accurate,
anticipating that White might want to play Jkh3. It is harder for him to find a good waiting move than it is for Black, so the stand¬ off is likely to end with White playing jkg2 and Black replying ...J,f5. Chapter 5 - Solutions 233 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1

19.±el Ne6?!
19...Qd7 has the intention of meeting
20.jkh4 with 20...Sg4, and would probably
limit White's advantage. However, Black would still have to face enduring pressure after a continuation such as: 20.Qb5 Qxb5

70. Svidler - Karjakin
Wijk aan Zee 2007
[diagram]
Obviously White is threatening to take on f6, and he also wants to play h2-h4 and Jkh3. Usually Black would decide between ...Nh5 and ...fad7 in such a position, but we should also ask if our opponent's threats can be met Chapter 5 - Solutions 235 with a more serious counter-threat. That is the case here:
19...5ab8!!
19...^d7 would give White time to organize
himself. Both 20.jUi3!? and 20.h4 Bab8
21.@e4°° do not look bad for White.
20.±d3?!
The bishop is acting solely as an aggressive unit from this square, which suggests that Svidler was too optimistic. According to Karjakin, 20.J,c4 was the best chance. Black can of course take on c4 and claim a slight edge. But I think Black can even play for more with 20...a5!? 2lJ,b3 Bb4 22.Qa3 Qd 1% and Black has a nice attacking position, even if there is no immediate breakthrough available.
20.gxf6? Bb4! is elementary.

71. Karjakin - Van Wely
Foros 2007
[diagram]
Black is on his way with ...f5, which will pose some inconvenient questions to the white pieces. Obviously a further ...f4 would leave the f-pawn hanging, but after Jbcf4 Black would have ...,iLf5 with an attack on c2 (and b3), setting the board alight. White had better prepare himself rapidly to deal with such challenges.
22.Nd2 6 23.Nc4
This has the disadvantage of exchanging Blacks stupid knight on a5, but at the same time it gets rid of White's lame horse and secures the bishop a great square on c4, where it blocks counterplay down the c-file.
23.Qh5 Qf7 looks about even to me.

80. Eljanov - Smeets

Blacks weakness is the b7/c6 constellation. White is able to make use of his strong bishop on f3 to put these pawns under pressure. Obviously, the light squares are the weakness (and maybe to some extent the b7-pawn), with the c6-pawn being the hook.

81. Topalov - Aronian
Linares 2010
[diagram]
White has a slight edge because of his superior pieces, but the game still has to be won - and this can only be done by good moves. In positions like this where there is a small but clear structural advantage (passed pawn and better pieces), it is usually important to increase the number of advantages in order to get anywhere. Here this happens by creating additional weaknesses, as all of Whites pieces are already placed on good active squares.
24.h4!
White threatens to play h4-h5, taking advantage of the slight ways the black kingside has been compromised. Black may now play
24...h5, when White replies 25.g3, and the
weakness of the g5-square combined with the X-ray from b3 to f7 increases Black's discomfort a little. Or he can allow White to advance the pawn. Personally I would probably have played 24...h5, but the fact that Aronian, now the solid No. 2 in the world, chose not to, shows that the choice is by no means easy.
24...5.d8!?
As mentioned, I do not fully trust this move.
24...f5?! would on the other hand be the wrong
track entirely. Black is passive and worse and will find that "active" lunges like this only create weaknesses. After the natural moves 25.?^xd6 Qxd6 26.h5 g5 27.Qc2! White is threatening to check on c7 as well as to take on f5. And after 27...Sf6 White can play either 28.Qd3!? or 28.d6, in both cases with a clear edge.

This is now forced. The main point is that after 25...g5 26.Qg4 White will soon establish a knight on f5.
26.Nxd6 Sxd6

26.e5!
This would have been incredibly strong. The white king's position is quite open, but there is no way for Black to get his bishop to work together with the heavy artillery to take advantage of this. On the other hand it is quite easy to see that the white bishop on b2 will provide real support to the attack against g7. On top of this the black queenside will fracture, pawns will drop and weaknesses persist. If White is not winning after this, he is at least close. The game ended in a draw after: 26.Rd5?!= If7 27±B Ne6 28.Rxd7 Bxd7 29.Bdl (29.f5±)
29...5.dlt 30.ixdl Qd7 31.Nf2 h6 32.Be2
Jig4 White might have some reason to play on here, but he probably felt that the trend was moving against him.
26.jkf3!?± is also a decent move, but it only
postpones the decision time and gives Black a chance to try and prepare a little for White's imminent break.
26...fxe5 27.Bxc6!
This is the concept. You can maybe delay taking here, but there is no point in doing so.
27...bxc6 28.Rcxe5!
To me this is most natural, though 28.jbce5 is also decent, intending to continue with Rxc6. White has a significant advantage, for example: 28..Jkh5 29.Sc4f M,(7 30.Qxa6 Sdl
31.Bcl± and the extra pawn means a lot.

28...Qd6
Black has no good moves. 28...Qf8
29.Qxc6 j^d3 (White should be winning
after something like 29...Qd6 30.Qxd6 cxd6
31.Se7 d5 32.^d4, when he will get a strong
passed pawn and can dream about attacking g7 later on.) 30.a4 h6 31.^,c3 and White is ready to play Qc5 then, if allowed, Re7.
28...Qf7 29.Qxc6 Bd6 30.Qc5 lets White
stay in control as well. He is immediately threatening an invasion on e7.
29.Qc4t
29.Qc3!? is also very strong. White has f4-
f5 ideas as well as posing the simple question: what is Black going to play on the next move?
29...6fB 30.Qxa6
Black has hardly any compensation for the pawn. His only chance is to play 30...c5 and try to draw the ending. White can choose between several continuations, all of them featuring a passed pawn on the queenside and strong pressure against g7.
83. Berg - Almeida Quintana
8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1
20...&f$!!
A strange-looking move, which I reckon is absolutely correct. Although his king is in need of safety, Black does not want to give away the control of the h-file too soon. Berg speculates that his opponent was unhappy with 20...O-O on account of 21 Jke4!, which seems reasonable. Berg gives the following (computer-inspired) line: 21..Jkg4 Montcada 2009
[diagram]
22.jtf3 Bxf3 23.Qxf3 Qa7 24.Qe4 b3!? with
interesting play. But spending time to defend the d4-pawn makes little sense. White should attack on the kingside immediately with
24.g4!.
8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 Black needs to seek counterplay absolutely immediately, but I fear that it is already too late: 24...b3!? (24...hxg4 25.Qxg4 Qxd4 26.h5 b3 27.Qh3! also gives White a strong attack.)
25.gxh5 bxc2f 26.Nxc2 Qxd4 27.Shgl with
the idea 27...Sab8 28.Sg4!±. Maybe Black can sidestep a lot of this with
21...1e6!? and it will take White a bit more
time to break through on the light squares.

White's pieces are all well placed so she should attack now, otherwise she may see her slight dynamic advantage on the kingside evaporate quickly.
16.6! ex6?!
A very natural reply, but it should have lost quickly. Black's only option was I6...g6, when after 17.fxe6 fxe6 18.Qg4 £}f8± the position is holding, but all her pieces are poorly placed. White now has time to manoeuvre her bits into threatening positions, for example with £k3-dl-e3-g4, with Qg4-h3 included at some point.
17.Sx6??
A horrible move, allowing Black to come close to equalizing. Instead White should have exploited the weakness of the light squares with 17.e6!. 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 After this Black will lose the d5-pawn and the f7-pawn's disappearance will lead to great problems on the light squares. 17...^f6 (17...RLf6 may be relatively the best option, but after 18.exf7t ^xf7 19.Qh5t White will take on h7 and the black king will be unhealthily exposed.

White has made the most out of the Berlin endgame. At this point he has the chance to get rid of his slightly limiting pawn on e5 (which is usually blockaded and in the way of the white pieces) and take on g7. Such an option to use tactics for positional gains should not be missed.

The ending after 22...^xd7 23.ibcg7 h5

A simple principle concerning a lead in development is that if you do not increase it or use it for immediate action, you are destined to lose it. This is exactly what Steinitz said back in the day.

A grave error that should have cost White all of his advantage. The correct plan was to open the centre before Black had time to finish his development. 17.e5! was therefore the correct move.

White's pawns on the queenside are quite impressive and might in the long term give him the chance to create a passed pawn. But more important is the weakness of the d6- and b6-squares and the pressure the b7-pawn can come under.

Coming from a modest variation of the Slav where White is aiming for a slight technical advantage, it is not always easy to create big problems for Black. Therefore it is necessary to create small but lasting problems! At this point White puts a bit of pressure on Black by forcing him to weaken his pawn structure a little. In the long term this is quite unpleasant, especially as the weakening is of the light squares, which Black must defend with a knight versus the white bishop.
18.1a5! b6 19.1d2± b5!?
This creates a further weakness in the black position. I think 19...Qd7 was slightly more accurate. White is still better after 20.Qc2! Bc8
21 Jtc3± with a long-term advantage, which is
certainly assisted by the slight weakening of the black queenside.
20 Jfc2 Sh3?!
20...Qb6 21.Hcl Bc8 was the best defence.
White has various plans from this point and would have to choose. One of these options is Qc2-dl-e2 followed by e3-e4 or Qg2 and playing on the kingside. White is still to be preferred of course, but his advantage is not too great yet.

15.Nxd7!
White has a very similar solution in 15.dxc5 Qxc5 16.^xd7 ^xd7 17Jtxe7 Sxe7 18.jkbl, though after 18...g6 19.Qe4 Hb8 Black's plight is slightly less severe as the rook on e7 is defended and White does not win a pawn. Nevertheless, after 20.Qf4± White has an excellent position and good winning chances.
15...^xd7
15...1xd7 I6.dxc5 would leave the bishop
on d7 exposed.
16.jbce7 Sxe7 l7.Mbl g6
17...^f6? 18.dxc5! would win White a

for Black, but after 18.dxc5 Qxc5 19.e4!± White has a great position.

White has two serious weaknesses, on h3 and c2. Black is able to exploit this immediately by freeing the f5-square for the bishop, at the same time gaining a tempo by attacking the h3-pawn.

22.Rcl Jbce4 23.Sxe4 axb3 24.axb3 Sa3
25.Sc3 Black certainly has great winning
chances with his extra pawn, but White has some activity and for this reason some practical chances for a draw.
97. E. Paehtz - Zawadzka
Antakya (1.3) 2010 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 The weaknesses in the black position - the exposed nature of the e8-rook, the weakness of the light squares, such as f7, around the king, and the pressure on the c2-h7 diagonal - have quite a temporary nature. White has to react aggressively to ensure that these do not just disappear, for example after ...g6.
22.1xe5 Qxe5 23.Sfel?!
The second-best option, giving Black the chance to reach an endgame with a higher chance of survival than she deserves.
23.Rd7! immediately was the best move. Black
has virtually no choice, and after 23...Jkc6 24Jff7t *h8 25.Sxd8 Sxd8 26.Qxa7± she would be facing a horrible uphill struggle. I guess that the reason Paehtz did not choose this line is that she saw the double threat
26...Qe2?! and simply stopped here.
[diagram]
A forgivable reaction, but actually White is just winning on account of 27.^gl Qxc2
28.Qc7 and the piece is regained and the black
pawns exposed.
23..Jff4?
23...Qc7? is easily refuted with 24.Rxd8
followed by 25.ibcf5!. The X-ray towards e8 is decisive. But Black had a serious chance to get in
23...g6!, when the situation is inconclusive.
White is better, but she will face serious technical challenges: 24.Qxh7t Nxh7 25.Rxe5 Sxdlt 26.ixdl Ng7 27.Bc2 Nf6 28.Se2 (28.Hel Rd8 29.Rdl looks attractive until you see the speed of the black king: 29...Rxdlt

18...Qc6?
Karjakin called this pure carelessness on the part of his opponent, admitting that he had nothing prepared against: 18...bxa4!
19.Sxa4 (19.c4?! would be too optimistic.
After 19...@c6 20.Qc2 Black can still equalize with 20...d5, but stronger is 20...Bab8 and it is White who will have to look for ways to equalize.) 19...d5
[diagram]
Black has essentially equalized. He is ridding himself of the weak d-pawn and he will have counterplay against b2, outweighing the weakness of his a-pawn.
19.axb5 axb5 20.Rxa8 Bxa8
At this point Karjakin fell in love with a little tactical idea on the kingside.
21.h4?!
Even after this inaccuracy White retains a slight advantage, and he still managed to win the game on move 49. However, his position would have been considerably more attractive had he played the simple manoeuvre 21.Qel! with the idea of ftc2- b4, with an obvious positional advantage. Black would suffer a lot with his two pawn weaknesses.

25.a3?
After 25.c4? a3! the white king is in deep trouble.
25.Jkf2!! was the right move. The idea is to meet
25...bxa2 with 26.c4°°, when White is fully
in the game. Other replies, such as 25...Sh6
26.a3 bxc2 27.Qxc2± would be acceptable for
White, of course.
25.cxb3 axb3 26.a3? was possible as well,
though things are a bit unpleasant for the white king. Black can try 26...Qb5 with various tactical ideas, for example 27.Rhel? £k3! 28.bxc3 Sxa3t 29-^bl @a4 and White loses something.

Copenhagen 2004

If Black had time to play ...c6 he would be a bit worse, but solid. White would push his pawns forward on the queenside and try to create a weakness in typical style. Black would try to create some counterplay on the kingside, but his chances would be worse, for the obvious reason that he has not yet started his counterplay there. Chapter 5 - Solutions 261

Black. For example, after 18...jkc6 White has

101. Michalik - Zherebukh
Groningen 2011 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 The big weakness in the white position is of course the f4-square, but it seems that White has been able to push the knight backwards and will retain full control over the dark squares in his position (which are all weakened by implication). However, Black has a strong idea, which can be executed in two different ways, that takes advantage of these weaknesses.
11...1e5!!
11...Qh4 followed by ...RLe5 leads to a
transposition in all lines. But the text move is more natural, threatening ...£}f4 immediately.
12.gxh5?!

102. Shyam - Edouard
Hastings 2012
[diagram]
The obvious weakness in the black position is the advanced b-pawn, which constitutes a hook. If we were looking at it solely from this point of view, we might be tempted to play
10.a4!?, which would give some advantage.
But we should not forget that Black has neglected his development and thus exposed his king to a quick attack. Combining these two features gives White access to a powerful idea. Obviously many GMs will choose the right move quite quickly, simply because this kind of thinking is automatic in their heads, though it may not even be conscious.
10.c4!
I believe that White is already winning.
10...bxc4
The best chance. All the alternatives fail as well.
10...e5 ll.dxe6 d5 is a strange idea. Black is
playing for rapid development. Unfortunately White is just winning after 12.exf7t Qxf7

106. Carosso - Porter
Dublin 2008
[diagram]
White is trying to claim a slight edge by having a good knight on e4; he may later advance the h-pawn to create inconveniences on the kingside. Black decided to rid himself of his inferior bishop and open the inviting f-file with a small combination.
12...Nxe4 13.fxe4 Qxg5! I4.Qxg5 Jlh6
[diagram]
15.Qxh6
You might wonder whether 15.Qd2 would be more precise, as the white king is probably better placed on d2 than cl. On the other hand the black knight is not forced to retreat to h6 - it can also go to g7, which may look an Chapter 5 - Solutions 265 odd square, but once the knight arrives at h5, all will be going according to plan.
15...^xh6+ 16.h3 iLd7 17.^gl
White won this game on move 60 after Black spectacularly misplayed an equal ending. In this position I find it attractive to try to activate the knight on h6, rather than advancing the g-pawn as Black did in the game. The way I envisage this happening is 17...Ng7!? followed by ...Nh6-g8-f6-h5 and Blacks position is very pleasant to play. A follow-up could be ...Sf6 and ...c6!? to open a second front. Black is simply a little better, nothing dramatic.
107. Ivanchuk - Hiibner
Munich 1994

Sometimes the opponent's idea can be disregarded as unimportant. Paying attention to the opponent's plans is not the same as being subservient to them. Here White takes the offered pawn, confident that he will win back the exchange later.

108. Anand - Gelfand
Monte Carlo (rapid) 1999
[diagram]
Whites worst piece is the knight on a2; it is indeed rather silly. The biggest weakness in the position is, as so often in the Sicilian, the d5-square. At least this is the one that all of the play usually revolves around (there are also weaknesses for Black on d6 and b5, and for White on a3, c2 and c4 - and even f4 if you insist!). Allowing White the chance to carry out the most obvious strategy, the transfer of his worst- placed piece in the direction of the greatest weakness in the opponents position.

109. Karjakin - Beliavsky

White's position is so fantastic that it might seem impossible to misplay it. Nevertheless, Karjakin's advantage reduces considerably over the next few moves.
24.Nd5
24.Qd5 Bxal 25.Bxal b4 also gives Black
decent fighting chances, though White remains better after 26.c4.
24.b4!± was in my opinion the best move.
[diagram]
The pawn is fixed on b5 as a target and Black will have to remain passive in order to defend it. White will put a knight on d5 and manoeuvre the other knight around via el- Chapter 5 - Solutions 267 c2-e3 or similar, securing a close to decisive advantage.
24...b4!
Black should always play this move if possible.
25.Nd2
This shows that Karjakin was unhappy with his own play. If he had intended to allow ...b4, then he would surely have prepared to answer it with 25.c4, which does seem better than the move played. But it is clear that Blacks existence has been made just a little bit easier by weakening of the d4-square, as well as the fact that it is easier to defend the b-pawn. Black could even consider playing 25...b3!?, making the position a little more double-edged. White is a good deal better, but he is not enjoying the level of control that he should have been.
25...bxc3 26.bxc3 Sxal 27.Sxal =

110. Van Kampen - Andriasian
Groningen 2010

15...Qxc5?
It is quite hard to explain how a strong grandmaster like Andriasian can play a move like this, but it is safe to say that he did not fully take his opponents ideas into account. After the forced 15...dxc5, White may play I6.e5 "S,e7, but because there is no pawn hanging on d6 and no tempo gained with ^c3-e4, it is by no means obvious that White has any advantage. I6.e5!

17.Ne4 Wc 7?
A further sign that Black was having an off- day. White now wins easily.
17...Qe7 was necessary in order to defend
the f6-square so that he can later play ...f7-f5. White still has tempting options, but not a directly decisive one. 18.£}d6t (18.^,d5!? also leads to a clear edge, but in a more technical position where Black is under less practical pressure.) 18...^£8 19.fxe5 ^g5 20.Qc3 bxc4

Black has a lead in development, but should White manage to play jke3 and O-O, he would not be worse. Black therefore has to prevent this in order to play for an advantage.
15...Nb4! 16.Ne5?!
I6.a4?! j^c6 is also very pleasant for Black. However, White should have tried I6.a3! in order to get some counterplay. Black should of course play his trump card with I6...ikb5, though White surprisingly has a temporary pawn sacrifice: 17.Qf2 @xf2f 18.(^)xf2 £}xc2

16...dxe5 17.1xa8 O-O

112. Wang Hao - Shengelia
Rogaska Slatina 2011
[diagram]
Black has a poorly-placed knight on h8 and White is about to advance the g-pawn to put pressure on the e6/f5 constellation. Black has to be ready to defend against this and it is common sense that if you can use your worst- placed piece for this purpose, then that is indeed a very attractive option.
21.JU7?
This has an automatic feel to it - the bishop was on its original square and is therefore being included in the game. But the move is not pertinent to the circumstances on the board, and so constitutes poor positional play. Instead the correct move was 21...4}g6!, when after 22.g4 ^e7 the game is about equal.

Il.Nd2 Nb6 12.1b5 Ng4 13.h3 Nh6 White is close to being positionally winning and can play the position in many different ways.

22.b4?
The advance of the pawns on the queenside is the right positional idea. Unfortunately this move allows Black to play 22...j|a4!, when any further advance on the queenside would be nearly impossible, and White has no advantage at all. For this reason the correct move was 22.a4!, preventing Black's blockading idea and intending to play 23.b4 next. 22...^f6 (White is also better after 22...e5 23.b4 Be6 24.a5±)
23.b4± White is better and will put Black
under real pressure with his extra pawn on the queenside and his two bishops. The following variation shows how things could go: 23...ftd7
24.jte3 e5 (24...£\e5 25.f3!± and White
dominates the black pieces) 25.b5 axb5?! It is probably better to accept a weakness on a6, but Black is in trouble none the less. 26.axb5 Be4 27.f3 f4 28.Bf2 Bf5 29.Sa7 Sb8 30.c5 White should win.

115. Leko - Grischuk
Mexico City 2007
[diagram]
White should be a little better on account of his freer play and the pressure down the d-file. The safest way to secure this edge is by taking into account Blacks intentions. At this point his bishop on e7 is not very well placed and the knight on f6 is also somewhat restricted. Therefore his most natural plan is ...^g4, ...j^f6 and ...£}ge5. Leko prevents this with a simple move.
19.h3!

117. Blomqvist - Howell
Stockholm 2006
[diagram]
The most important thing for Black to do in this position is to get closer to completing his development. It is not always necessary to finish it at top speed, other things are important too, but you should at least leave flexibility to do so. The worst-placed piece is the knight on g8, as not only is it not taking part in the game, but it also prevents the king from getting to safety. The best square for this knight is f5, from where it can both attack the centre and irritate the misplaced bishop on h4.
7...Nh6!
This knight would have no function on the more "aesthetic" f6-square, but will be excellently placed on f5. When I have given this exercise to students they have far too often (80%) chosen an active plan in the centre, for which they were ill-prepared. The two standard ones are pushing the c- and e-pawns.
7...C5 is the lesser evil, as it does not open the
position fully. However, Black's pieces are not playing, and following 8.jke2 I think White is in general better mobilized. After 8...^c6
9.O-O! White is happy to give up the d-pawn
for the centre to be opened, and Black will not escape easily. Thus the best move is: 8...^h6 9.@b3! A strong exploitation of the bishops early deployment to g4. 9...Nd7 10.Qb5!±
7...e5? is even worse. White can ask Black what

118.1. Sokolov - Mamedyarov
Villarrobledo 2008
[diagram]
White's set-up is a bit artificial; the bishop is not great on f3, and the bishop on b2 is worse than the one on g7, simply because it is unprotected and thus more likely to end up in an unpleasant pin. However, rather than just taking the bishop pair at once, although that is quite an attractive idea, Black decides to launch an attack in the centre, forcing White to put his pieces on inferior squares.

119. Aronian - Anand
Moscow 20 1 1
[diagram]
Whites pieces are not especially poorly placed, but if we look at them carefully, we can see that the queen is a bit uncomfortable in view of the possibility of ...d4. Obviously it has available squares and Aronian clearly was not worried about this. But once Anand made his move, the size of the problem became apparent.
16..Jfb8!+
This move has multiple functions. Besides protecting the bishop it reduces the value of White's escape squares for the queen. The threat of ...d4 is now very real. A standard developing move like I6...Rc8? would have led to a more or less equal game, but would not be reacting to the positional factors of the position.
17.Qft

120. Vitiugov - Ganguly
8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 In slow, closed positions like this, computers are of little help. The point here is that with the centre almost hermetically sealed, all the play will happen on the kingside. Black is going to find himself in a minority there and should maybe have considered giving up the strong-looking but relatively ineffective bishop on a6 for the white knight. Instead White regroups it before going ahead with the planned kingside invasion.
20.Ngl! ftb8
Black plays like he has all the time in the world, but in reality he needed to try to do something quickly, before White is too well organized. 20...1c4 with the faint hope of provoking b2-b3 could be tried, but it is not apparent what he should do after 21.Sal!, delaying the decision for later.

Beijing (rapid) 2011
[diagram]
28...b3?
This is a horrible move, and it is difficult to understand how a player like Ivanchuk can make it - even in a rapid game. The bishop is left entirely out of play with a naive dream of assisting the promotion of the b-pawn. As White is much more actively placed, this is unrealistic. White is now able to push his own pawn with the assistance of all his pieces.
28...jkb3 is wholly unnatural and it is not
surprising that White has a simple way to an edge. Here both 29.Rc6 and 29.ihd5! Jbcd5
30.Qxd5 are good, when White will win the
b-pawn and hold on to the d-pawn. Winning will still not be trivial, but Black's defence will be very difficult.
28...jke6! was the correct move. The bishop
looks to support the b-pawn from a stable square and keeps an eye on the d-pawn at the same time. The threat to the d6-pawn is now very real. To be honest, nothing more is needed to make this decision, but it is nice to check a few lines anyway. 29.Rc6 (29.Rc7 b3 30."S,b7 is not dangerous. The easiest way to secure a draw is probably 30...b2 31.Qb6 Hd8 followed by ...Rxd6, although many other ideas are good enough as well.) 29...b3 30.Rb6 Qd8 The queen would also be decently placed on c8, but pinning the rook makes a lot of sense. 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1

123. Chemiaev - Kotronias
Hastings 2003 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 There are a few obvious features of this position - White is playing in the centre and on the queenside, whereas Black is aiming for a mating attack on the kingside, presumably by rolling the pawns forward. Because we have this contest between static play (slow pressure on the queenside and the hope of eliminating dynamics) and dynamic play (speed being of the essence in the attack), it is very important to take into account all aspects of the position, for example, the weakness of the e5-pawn and the need for White to reinforce his defence of the kingside with £\bd2. Combining all of these factors, Kotronias came up with a good way to inject energy into the attack.
17...$g5!?
17...g5? looks natural, but does not take
[diagram]
into account the important features of the position. White plays 18.jkc3!± with the idea of ^bd2-c4 (if allowed), when he hopes to tie White down before playing Ba6 and Efal. If Black plays 18...g4 19.hxg4 jbcg4 White has time for 20.5^bd2 with a very pleasant position. It will take Black quite some time to create a real attack.
18.5}xg5
Another advantage of Black's last move is that White has no choice but to exchange the knights. Instead of being passive on f7, the black knight has exchanged the only defender White has on the kingside.

The threat to the h3-pawn wins another tempo.

124. Leko - Khalifinan
Budapest (rapid) 2000
[diagram]
The opening has been just a modest success for White. He has gained the two bishops, but Black has a very powerful bishop on d4 and a solid pawn structure. Any advances have to be incremental and based on accuracy. The first thing to determine is that White should not go for any immediate action on the queenside with
18.cxb5. The second thing is to understand
that exchanging the bishop on d4 too quickly would weaken the dark squares throughout the white position, and even though we do not anticipate the knight making it to d4, we could imagine having to exchange our good bishop for the knight, and maybe a black rook reaching d4 eventually. Blacks only weakness is the b5-pawn (a hook) and the complex of pawn it fronts. The push a2-a4 will be in the air. Therefore the light-squared bishop belongs on b3, both because it is rather restrained where it is, and because we need this pawn push. But we also need to determine where the rooks belong. As the a 1-square is unavailable, the only open line where we can imagine having any fun is the c-file. The d-file is blocked and falls under our opponent's influence. We have two rooks and they should be doubled where they can do some good. However, doubling the rooks immediately would block the transfer of the bishop to b3, so the correct move order is to improve the bishop first.
18.±c2!
18.cxb5 cxb5 19.a4 bxa4 is too much too

125. Seirawan - Tal
Montpellier 1985
[diagram]
It is rather obvious that the rooks are going to be exchanged in the very near future. After this we will have a scenario where White dominates the dark squares and Black the light squares. It is also clear that Blacks king is more exposed and that a draw would be a satisfying result for Black. For this reason, White needs to think about his own king's protection, not from mate, but from perpetual check. The only place the king can hide is on h2, so this determines the recapture.
[diagram]
Chapter 5 - Solutions 283
25.fcg3!
This is the most dangerous approach. Black should be able to hold the game without too much trouble, but it requires some accuracy and as we shall see, this is not something that even such a great player as Mikhail Tal could manage over the board. After thinking about the probability of a perpetual check, it is useless to contemplate taking with the h-pawn. But it is worth having a quick look at the consequences of
25.Sxd5!? Axh2t 26.<^>xh2 cxd5 27.Qa4,
when White will win the pawn back shortly. But the problem is that after the exchange of pawns, the draw is closer and the white king is a bit less safe than in the game. I do not believe that the draw is too far away.
27...b6 28.Qd4 h5 29.Qxd5t Nh7 I find
it difficult to imagine that White would be able to overcome a reasonably played black defence.
25...5xdlt 26.Qxdl Qd7 27Jfel Ae6
The first inaccuracy I could detect. Tal is trying to be active on the queenside where he has a majority, but passive defence would have a far greater chance of success. The best move was 27...Qd6!
[diagram]
This anticipates White's plan of h3 and ^h2, and also prevents the white bishop from appearing on e5 too soon. After 28.h3 h5 there is no reason to believe that Black would not be able to conduct a successful defence.
28.b3 c5
I also do not like this move much. Black is being too active, when passive defence would be more appropriate. The main problem with this move is that it weakens the b5rsquare, which results in an entry point into the black position.
28...Qd3 29.h3 would also lead to an
advantage for White. You could imagine a line like 29...b6 30.jk,e5 h5 31.Qf2 !kf5 32.Qf4 with some advantage.
29.H3 b5?
This is too optimistic.
29...h5 also fails to work, for very similar
reasons to the game continuation: 30.Qfl! Qf7
31.Qb5! and Black is under a lot of pressure.
There are too many weaknesses in the black position for it to be anything but seriously unpleasant. The best defence was probably 29...Qd3 30jke5 h5, though White has a long-term edge.

30.Q fl!
White is probably winning now. The queen will penetrate the position, and Black is suffering from the weaknesses he has inflicted on himself.
30...b4 31.±e5 ffd8
31...@e7 32.Qb5 &£7 would offer a bit
more resistance, but after 33.Qb8 Black is still in serious trouble.

Black cannot defend this position in my opinion. 33..Jkf7 34.Qa5 a6 35.Qb6

black pawns are all going down) 37.Qe7 Qc6

126. Sedlak - Gustafsson
Aix-les-Bains 2011
[diagram]
This position is rather simple; Black needs to get the bishop on c8 into the game quickly so he can enjoy his bishop pair. In order to do this he needs to get the knight out of the way. But obviously he should not just mechanically put it on f6, where it would be going nowhere.
15...Nb8!
The other option was 15...Sd8 to play ...5^d7- f8-e6, but this has two minor downsides - it is a bit slower and the knight could easily be in the way of the c8-bishop again. Sure, you can bring the bishop out first, but this would decrease Blacks flexibility. From c6 the knight will shoot instantly at d4, causing White to have serious concerns straight away. I6.Ne5!? A radical move, following which it will be very difficult to hang on to the pawn, but what else should White play? After something like I6.h3^c6 17.Sadi Black will come out of the box in a very scary way: 17...Be6 18.Bfel a5+ and White's position is very difficult to keep together.
[diagram]
I6...1xe5!? The simplest solution. Black will attack the pawn immediately. Chapter 5 - Solutions 285
16...f6 would keep the tension and aim at a
long-term advantage, and was also good.
17.dxe5 18.Sael Se8 19.Qd2
19.Qc3 Jkd7 20.Nc5 Sad8+ is also deeply
problematic for White; the e5-pawn is very weak.

Black is a pawn up and won on move 37.
127. A. Kristjansson - Nataf
Reykjavik 2008
[diagram]
White has obvious pressure against d6 and Black has some counterplay down the g-file. However, Black can gain a winning advantage through giving up his knights for a white rook. We need to pay attention to this kind of tactic as well.
32...^de5t! 33.Nxe5 ^xe5t 34.Ne3
34.Ne2 Sg2t is even worse.
34...Nxc4t 35.&B Nxd2t 36.Sxd2
We can now see that White's minor pieces are rather poor with no scope, while the black rooks will penetrate the white position quickly.
36...5.l+
This led to Black winning on move 49, but
36...Bg4!? followed by ...Sh4 is even stronger,
and is probably just winning for Black.

131. Anand - Kamsky
8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 This looks like a typical Sicilian position, but in this case White has a strong unconventional option. 12jfb6!± A devastating move for Black. Once the queens are exchanged, Black is left with passive pieces and problems defending the d6-pawn.
12.e5!? is also interesting, but ultimately
leads to a defendable position for Black:
12...dxe5 13.Qxe5Bb4 I4.Qxa5ibca5 15.Bd4

12...Qxb6 13.ilxb6
White's advantage is considerable as Black cannot become active. If he did not have a weakness on d6, he would not be in such a bad situation, but it is there.

Palma de Mallorca 1969

White has an excellent position with complete control, but in order to improve it, he needs to make the most of all of his pieces. At this point, White's least active piece is the bishop on g2, which is staring straight at the immobile pawn on e4. Korchnoi wanted more from the bishop and created a new diagonal for it.

He would probably follow up with Nh2, Qf2, Hd2 and similar moves that simply improve the position without committing to a specific action.
24.1h3 WbS 25.Nh2 lc8

136. Van der Wiel - Portisch

17...c4! 18.Ne5
It is not entirely without value to spend a tempo provoking a weakness with 18.Ba5, though unlike elsewhere in this book, the weakening of the c6-square after 18...b6 is not so critical here. White no longer has his light-squared bishop and Black does not have any problems protecting the light squares in the short term. He might have some problems securing his king in the long term, but at the moment this would not extend to much more than a minor annoyance.
18...5c8!=
Black should of course not fall for 18...Rxd4?

19.1f4Bd6
Van der Wiel is not a great fan of technical positions, so here he took the rather unfortunate decision to unbalance the position.
[diagram]
Black has a potentially good square on d5, but at the moment White would be able to kick the knight away with c2-c4. As there are few things as wonderful as a stable knight in the centre, Blacks next move is almost automatic; I seriously doubt that Portisch hesitated before playing it.

138. Bu Xiangzhi - Nijboer
Wijk aan Zee 2007

The two most important aspects of this position are the weakness of the d6-pawn and the poorly-placed knight on f5. Bu tried to trap the knight, but went completely astray, only winning the game due to a blunder by his opponent. I believe that he did not fully appreciate how weak d6 really is.

and Black is simply a piece down. There are some complications, but the position is won for White.
22...bxc6 23.g4!
Belated, but not too late to be effective. The knight is after all trapped.
23...d5
After 23...Sxb2 24.gxf5 ikxf5 25.Re2± White is a piece up, though there are still some complications remaining.
[diagram]
24.cxd5?
This is truly feeble; Bu misses another great option. Here White could have invaded his opponent's position with 24.Se6!, leading to all kinds of threats. The forced line goes:
24...Nd4 25.Sxg6 Rxf4 26.£}xd4! and Black
cannot recapture on d4 because of 27.Qe5!, but has to play 26...Sxflt> when after 27.ibcfl the only move that keeps the game going is
27...Qf8!. Here White has many tempting
options, all leading to good winning chances. But after 15 minutes of probing, I still have not found a knock-out blow. Black seems to have many defensive resources. I allowed Fritz 12 to Chapter 5 - Solutions 295 speculate for a while; every minute it decided on another favourite, always claiming an advantage, but not a win, for White.
24...cxd5 25.Sa4?!
White is drifting badly. It was better to retreat with 25.Se2, when after 25...Nd4
26.ftxd4 Jbcd4t 27.M,e3 the position is quite
equal. A possible tactical end to the game would be: 27...ibce3t 28.Sxe3 Hxflt 29.Qxfl Sxb2 30Jbcd5t Qxd5 31.Se8t Nh7 32.Se7t ^g8 and so on.
25...Re8 26.Qcl
White is also a little worse after 26.Qa5 Qxa5 27.Sxa5 Rb4! 28.gxf5 Hxf4 29.fxg6 jkb7, when Black's bishops have come to life.
26...5xb2?
A completely needless sacrifice. After the simple 26...Qb6t 27.^hl ^e3! Black was simply a little better. I am not sure why Friso refrained from this pleasant option. It could be that he did not fully feel in control of the position after 28.jkxb8, but Black plays
28...6xfl 29.ibcfl Qxb8 with an edge, and
ideas such as 30.Qc6 Bb7! 31.Qxg6 d4, when White would be subjected to a fierce attack.
27.gxf5 kxf5 28.Nd4
White has many other options, but I am not sure if any are better.
[diagram]
28...Qd7??
A horrible move that is hard to explain. Black had several alternatives that would have kept him in the game.
28...Qb6 is playable, though it does not solve
all Blacks problems: 29.ibcd5t (29.ike3 Bd3! equalizes) 29...^h7 30.Qc7 Qxc7 3lJbcc7 Jke4! 32.Sel! Black cannot fully equalize, but after both 32...Sg2t 33.^fl Sf8t 34.£}f3 Jbcd5 35.Nxg2 Sxf3 36.^gl and 32..Jbcd4t
33.Sxd4 Sg2t 34.<&hl Se2t 35.Sxe4
S8xe4 36.Sxe2 Sxe2, Black has respectable drawing chances. I would personally hope to draw these endings about 80% of the time. The best option is the speculative sacrifice
28...5.g2t! 29.Nxg2 kxd4 30.Rxd4 Qxh4,
giving Black a lot of threats. I do not think White can gain a substantial advantage. For example: 31.Sf2 Qg4| 32.&fl g5! and a drawable ending is in the cards. Or 31.Qc3! Nh3t!? (31...g5 32.1g3 Ae4t 33.Sxe4 Qxe4f 34.Nh2 Rf8 is another good drawing chance. White should probably keep the rooks on and try to deliver mate, but it will not be so easy.) 32.Qxh3 Se2t 33.Nf3 Qxh3t 34.Nxe2 g5 and the pawns are probably strong enough to generate sufficient counterplay.
29.Nx6
White is winning.
29...Qxa4?!
29...See2 30.jkf3 Qxa4 may have been
Blacks intended idea, but White plays
31.Nxg7! and Black does not have an attack
without the all-important bishop.

139. Hillarp Persson - Stellwagen
Malmo 2006
[diagram]
Black has a lot of weaknesses on the light squares, but there is no easy way to exploit this. Tiger Hillarp found a fine tactical solution, with purely positional aims.
31.a4!!
White would like to make this advance if at all possible. Playing b4-b5 would give him a huge positional advantage, so Black has to take up the challenge.
31.Sc2± is a non-move.
31.b5 axb5 32.ibcb5 Hcc8 33.a4± is natural
enough, and White is a bit better. But Black still has the two bishops and a chance to fight for the light squares.
31.Qh7? cxb4 32.£\f6 simply does not work:
32...5xc4! 33.Qg8t Ne7 34.Qxg7 Sxcl
35.Sxcl b3!-+
31...cxb4
31...Bxd5 32jkxd5 Sc7 33.bxc5 dxc5
34.Bc4± gives White a more or less winning
positional advantage. Control of the light squares is a far more important factor than the opposite-coloured bishops. It is easy to imagine that Black will struggle greatly with his weak a- and c-pawns, as well as the permanently soft spot on f7.
32.5Bxb4 Bxb4 33.ibce6 7!

If White had time to consolidate with Qfl- e3 he would be very happy. For this reason, Black needs to react absolutely immediately.
17...b5!
18.Qg3
The only move, but hardly a refutation of the black advance!
18.Qxb5? would be a disaster. The knight
sacrifice on f3 looks strong, but even better is making some use of the passive bishop with
18...jbcg4!, when Black wins. For . example:
19.fxg4 Qxe4 20.Qf4 (20Jfc2 Qh4| 21.Qg3
Qf3t 22.^fl Qxh2f! and White will soon be sent to Sardinia in small tins.) 20...Qc3!! A fantastic move. (20...Qa5t 21.^dl Qxg4! also wins, but in a more complicated way.) 21.Qe3 Qxb5 Black is just winning.
18...b4 19.Qdl

19...Qexg4!?
This sacrifice borders on being too optimistic, but it is also characteristic of Zhao Juns love of complications. 19..Jk,a6! must be the correct move if you ask me - which in a way you did by buying this book! After 20.Qe3 Jbce2 21.(^)xe2 Qb6, the only thing that stops Black being better is that White can play 22.Qef5t! Ng8 23.Qh6.

141. Morrison - Rowson
Edinburgh 1999

If Black does not do anything then White will have quite a nice position with his bishop pair. For this reason, Rowson decided to fully establish control over the d4-square.
19...c5! 20.b5
20.bxc5 may have been better, but
20...Hxdlt 21.Hxdl ^xc5= would give Black
other advantages (the split white pawns), as a substitute for not getting the d4-square.
20...5.dlt 21.Sxdl Nd4
21...axb5!? 22.cxb5 ^e7 23.a4 would
be sharper. White obtains the c4-square, but has no target on a6 to play against. My engine prefers Black, but I really think the position is satisfactory for White.

A horrible move. After this White has no play and Black is well placed on the dark squares.

142. Morovic Fernandez - Seirawan
Novi Sad (ol) 1990
[diagram]
(Position after 16.,.e7-e5) Black would love to bring his pieces into play with ...exf4 and ...Ne5. He would not significantly mind if White played (the legal)
17.dxe6 fxe6, when ...d5 is in the air and the
e6-pawn is not really weak. And 17.g3?! exf4
18.gxf4 Sae8 would give Black a target for
counterplay.
17.6! cxd5
17...Sad8 18.Sd2 does not diminish the
white advantage. Eventually he will threaten dxc6 and Black will have to play ...cxd5 anyway.
18.Axb6?
This leads to an attack that is only good enough for a draw. Correct was 18.Nxd5! Nxd5 19.Rxd5. 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 And now the best is probably 19...gxf5
20.exf5 Sfe8±, as after the natural 19...^f6
White has the powerful move 20.Sb5!, where the rook is looking at the important a5-, b7-, d5- and e5-squares. In such a scenario, White's advantage is probably quite close to being decisive.
18...Qxb6 19.£}xd5 Qxb2 20.fxg6 hxg6
21.Sabi Qa3 22.kg4 23.Sb3 Qxa4
24.5}e7t &H7 25.Sh3t 1H6
At this point White no doubt started looking for the exit. This could have happened with
26.Qf3 Ng7 27.Sxh6 Nxg4 28.Qxg4 <Nxh6
29.5}f5t with a perpetual.
26.&6I? gxf5 27.1x51 Ng7

Black now took over the initiative, though White managed to draw the game on move 59.
143. Gheorghiu - Rajkovic
Lone Pine 1980
[diagram]
27.a4!
This is the correct move. White wants to put his pawn on a5 and is aided by tactics. In the game White played 27.Rb8?!, which threw his advantage away (although he won on move 47 anyway). After 27...Rd8! 28.Rxd8 Jbcd8 White would not manage to advance his a-pawn. For example: 29.Sal Qa4=
27...5da7
Black has to go into defensive mode.
27...Rxa4? 28.^b6 would give White a
technically winning endgame.
28.a5 ±d8 29.Sal±
Whether White can win this ending is not obvious, but he could certainly have a fair go.

144. Speelman - Short
8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 The weaknesses in the white camp are f4 and f2 (and to some extent also g4). In the black camp the weakness is g7. White intends to play Qa7 to generate counterplay, something that worked very well for him in the game! Black's worst piece is most certainly the queen!
31..Jfb8!!
In the game Short played less strongly: 31 ...Qe8?ff 32.Qa7 Qg6t 33.&fl And here he blundered, indicating time trouble. 33...Qg4?? (33...5fb8¥) 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1

145. Nyzhnyk - Werle
Groningen 2010
[diagram]
Black is under some pressure down the d-file and it would be quite natural to look mainly at defensive ideas. But if we do our three- point analysis we notice that there is indeed a weakness of importance in the white position and that our worst-placed piece can attack it in only two moves. Had Werle thought in terms of the three questions, he would probably have drawn this game quite easily. Instead he swam like an axe, to use a Russian idiom.
17...Nd7?
17...^c6! was the correct response. The
main line goes 18.e5 Na5! with counterplay.
[diagram]
In my opinion White does not have any advantage here. He has a few options, but really what we need to play like this with Black is only to check the absolutely concrete stuff: 19.exd6 Nxd6 20.ibcc5 ^xb3 21 Jbcd6 Nxd2 These kinds of desperado moves where you have to make the right captures with the right pieces can be a bit confusing, but here it works out beautifully. 22.ibce7 (22.^xd2?

26.Nxdl Qe5 Black has no problems in this
ending. White can also try 18.h4, but it does not make any difference, Black will respond with the same idea of 18...^a5! with sufficient counterplay.

21.Sxd8 Sxd8

146. Zhu Chen - Koneru

The most important factor in the position is the badly-placed knight on h5. White would love to push it with g2-g4, but at the moment Black can meet 24.g4? with 24...Qxb2!
25.£}e4 5}f4!, when she would have the
advantage. White's job is thus to prepare for this tactic - this can be by preventing it or through having a way to deal with it when it comes. An interesting move is 24.b3!?, simply preventing ...Qxb2. White should certainly have the advantage after this. But there is an even stronger way to deal with it, taking advantage of the weakness of the d6-pawn as well.
24.Sa3?
This move makes little sense beyond trapping the queen if it takes on b2. Black now has time to activate her queen.
24.e4! was the perfect way to take advantage
of Blacks problems; g2-g4 is now a huge threat. 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 Black's only attempt to obtain play is to go through with her plan with 24...Qxb2, when the simplest is 25.^xd6. Black's pieces are all hanging, and it is hard to come up with a recommendation. The best try seems to be
25...Nf4, but White wins with accurate play:
26Axe8 Sxe8 27.Sfel £}fd3?! (27...f6 may be a more practical approach, but White has a winning advantage after 28.Sadi c4 29.Sbl!, when Black is missing her usual ...Qd4 resource.) 28.ibcd3 Qxf2f 29.Jbcf2 ^xd3

147. Shaw - Meier
Liverpool 2008
[diagram]
Black's weakness is the king. The weakest squares in his position are e6 and e8. It is too easy to get deluded into thinking that the pin is important, when in fact Black is very well placed to deal with it. For this reason, the worst-placed white piece is ironically the rook, which would be much better checkmating the black king, rather than hitting its head against a brick wall.
35.Sel!
Black is immediately done for. In the game John blew his chance, playing 35.^h2?, when Meier seized the advantage with 35...<Ng7? and won on move 48.
35...Ng7
35...Bb7 36.Se6 Qc5t 37.Nh2 Qf8 and

35...Qc5t? 36.Nh2 Qxc4 leads directly to
mate: 37.Se8t Ng7 38 Jff8t Nxg6 39.Se6t and so on.
35...Rc7 prepares a check on c5 for real, but
White can sidestep it in many ways, including moving the b-pawn, the king or the bishop - all of them winning.

Exchanging the queens would also work.

There are a few weaknesses in the white position - the a4-pawn, the d4-square, the f2- pawn and maybe even the d3-pawn, though it is hard to see how Black will be able to attack Chapter 5 - Solutions 305 it at the moment.

White should be better because of the pressure against the b5-pawn, but he has to decide how to deal with Black's two possible plans for improving his position: ...5}b6 and ...5}f8-e6. The correct move is based principally on meeting the second of these options.
37.Sa5!
37.Sa6!?± is weaker. Black can fight for
counterplay with 37...5}f8! 38.Qc5 5}d7 with the idea of 39.Qc2 5}b6!?. White has not managed to control the knight. The main point comes in the following line: 40.5}c3 5}c4 4l.jbcc4 bxc4 42.b5 Jk,b7 43.Sa4 @c7 44.5}e2 Qb6 45.Qxc4 lff2 46.Sal h5 47.Qc2 Nh7^ White still has some challenges in proving his advantage at this point.
37...Sd4
Black clearly found it hard to come up with a sensible move. 37...5}b6 is obviously out of the question, and Black is also in serious trouble after 37...5}f8 38.5}c3±, when White wins a pawn. The following line shows a plausible way for the game to continue: 38...Sd4 39.Jbcb5 Mb7 40.?}e2 White keeps his extra pawn, as Black cannot take the b4-pawn. 40...Sxb4?! 4l.Qa3 Sbl 42.£}c3 Sel 43.Qe7! The simple "S,e8! is threatened. 43...5}g6 44.Qd7! Now Qd2! is the threat. 44...Se3 45."i,c4! Black loses material and his structure fails. The key tactical point is 45...Sxc3 46.jbcf7t Nh7
47.ikxg6t Nxg6 48.Qf5#.
38.Qd2 Sd6
[diagram]
39.5}g3! 5}fS
39...g6 was the most stubborn defence, but
White has a great advantage after he wins the b5-pawn with 40.Qe2!±.
40.Qc3
40.5}f5 may be a bit more accurate, but
White is winning all the same.
40...Qb6 41.5}SSd7
Chapter 5 - Solutions 307 4l...He6 42.@c5 also wins for White. The main point is that Black's problems only accelerate after 42...Qxc5 43.bxc5 b4 44.Bc4.

Montreal 2008
[diagram]
It is not clear at first glance how to judge Black's unusual set-up with the pawn on h3 and knight on g2 - is it an effective invasion of the white position, or is the knight misplaced? This is a common phenomenon in modern chess. Being able to evaluate which factor is the most important is what many games are all about. Having said this, usually it is possible to cut complicated positional questions down to some simple basics. The white knight on dl and the rook on fl are poor. The knight on g2 may be good or bad, depending on circumstances. The f3-square is weak. The pawn on e6 is exposed. Black is able to solve all of these issues with a simple stroke.
25...e5!! 26.dxe5
White has no real alternatives. 26.Qxe5 Re8 followed by 27...Qf3 wins quickly.
26.f3 exd4 is also hopeless.

He is the only chess author to have received the Boleslavsky Medal as well as the Guardian, ECF and ChessCafe Book of the Year awards. He is a FIDE Senior Trainer, and on his retirement from professional chess he has taken up the post as trainer for the Danish elite. His training material is used by amateurs, grandmasters and World Champions alike.. In Positional Play Jacob Aagaard shares his simple three-step tool of positional analysis that he has used with club players and famous grandmasters to improve their positional decision¬ making. Working from the starting point that all players who aspire to play at international level have a certain amount of positional understanding, Aagaard lays out an easy-to-follow training plan that will improve everyone's intuition and positional decision-making. "The tools that Aagaard uses in this book look simple. But his method of three questions and his rather modest approach shouldn't deceive readers - if you follow the instructions carefully and concentrate on these important questions, you will most likely focus on the central elements of the position, which will help you to find the solutions of the exercises. Working with this book will train your positional judgement and develop your chess intuition. You will improve your decision-making process and learn some new practical skills. And maybe you will be able to make another step forwards..." From the foreword by Artur Yusupov The GRANDMASTER PREPARATION series is aimed at ambitious players.
