Table of Contents Preface Chapter 1 The Rauzer Variation: doubled f-pawns for Black Chapter 2 The Maroczy Bind Chapter 3 The Hedgehog Chapter 4 The Sveshnikov Variation Chapter 5 French Defence: Winawer Variation Chapter 6 Italian, Petroff, Ruy Lopez Chapter 7 Exercises 2 Preface Fifteen years ago (in 2008) I started with my work on middlegames in chess, and my first book on this topic was titled Winning Chess Middlegames. That book was (mostly) based on middlegames arising from 1.d4 openings and was divided into four basic pawn structures: • White has doubled c-pawns (like in the Nimzo-Indian Defence and similar openings); • White has hanging pawns in the centre; • White has an isolated pawn; and • White has a pawn majority in the centre. That book was well received and I was often asked if there would be a similar work involving middlegames coming from 1.e4 openings. At that time I was still an active player; my White-side openings were based on 1.d4 while my main weapons with Black were different variations of the Ruy Lopez. Understandably, at that time I was not in a hurry to delve into all the different Sicilians, Frenchs, and Caro-Kanns. At the end of 2013, I finished my career as an active player and started coaching. My early 'training jobs' were with promising young players like Alireza Firouzja, Parham Maghsodloo and Salem AR Saleh. Obviously, 1.e4 openings and the middlegames arising from them became my daily routine now... when I had spent enough time investigating those middlegame positions, the old question resurfaced: why not a book on Winning Chess Middlegames with 1.e4 Structures ? I considered I was up to the job now, and this book is a product of that decision. The middlegames arising from 1.e4 openings are very diverse, and it was next to impossible to include all of them in one book in a proper way. So I had to make choices. I understand that some readers may be disappointed that, for example, the Sicilian Pawn Storm, the Sicilian Dragon, the Open Ruy Lopez, the French Tarrasch and the Caro-Kann are not included in this book, but... I had to make choices. It is quite possible that sometime at the end of 2025 I may find the time and energy to write 3 another edition including the middlegames coming from these openings. As for the opening lines that did find their way into this book, I wanted to analyse the positions thoroughly, and the material presented is predominantly aimed at improving the reader's playing level. I have tried to present the knowledge I have acquired during twenty years as a top-level player plus a coaching career of ten years, working with some of the world's best players of today, in an accessible way so that readers of different chess levels can benefit from it. As its name suggests, the book is aimed at middlegame improvement; however, I also share a sizeable portion of my opening knowledge. I hope that the chosen games will inspire the reader on his/her journey to chess improvement. Ivan Sokolov Amsterdam, October 2023 4 Chapter 1 The Rauzer Variation: doubled f-pawns for Black In these first four chapters, we will discuss four typical Sicilian structures: The Rauzer Variation (Chapter 1), the Maroczy Bind (Chapter 2), the Hedgehog (Chapter 3) and the Sveshnikov Variation (Chapter 4). Understanding the dynamics of the Rauzer Variation where Black has doubled f- pawns is, in my view, very important for an understanding of open Sicilians in general. We will start with two examples involving very strong players landing in practically lost positions with White without blundering anything or (seemingly) doing anything stupid. In both cases, bad judgement by the white player of the timing of central pawn structure changes had disastrous consequences. A dream position for Black that White should avoid This is a dream position for Black in these Rauzer structures. He has an excellently placed Bh6, his king is safe on e7, his rooks are connected (the Rh8 is ready to join the attack on the queenside, and his pawns are rolling towards White's king. 5 White's pieces are poorly coordinated; the Bd3 and the Nf3 are doing nothing, and the d5-square in Black's camp is a purely 'academic weakness'. It will take White a very long time to create threats while Black's attack is swift. Standard mistakes by White In many Rauzer lines where Black's f-pawns are doubled (after the trade Bxf6 gxf6; both in the Kozul Variation with 8...Bd7 and the classical Rauzer with 8...Be7), White's basic positional idea is to push f5, provoke Black's ...e5, and try to capitalize on Black's light-square weaknesses. There is however one common mistake many top players often make! At the moment when the central pawn structure transformation has taken place (White has pushed f5, Black has responded with ...e5), the future of White's c3- knight is crucial for judging the timing (and effects) of the f4-f5 pawn push! Most of the time Black has already pushed ...b4, so White's knight is no longer on the c3- square and hence cannot immediately jump to d5. The ideal future for White's knight is to be placed on h5-square (hitting f6) and preparing a pawn storm with h4, g4, and g5, shattering the black king's pawn defences. Often White players make a mistake by closing the centre while their knight does not have such a future! In such cases White's position becomes cramped, active is play difficult to find for him, while Black's king is safe in the centre and Black can quickly launch a strong attack on White's monarch. I will show a few instructive examples where this mistake was committed by some very strong players. Game 1 Nigel Short 2660 Zdenko Kozul 2560 Belgrade 1989
1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 d6 3.d4 cxd4 4.Nxd4 Nf6 5.Nc3 Nc6 6.Bg5 e6 7.Qd2 a6 8.O-O-O Bd7
Zdenko Kozul started exploring 'his' variation in the mid-1980s and had many instructive ups and downs with it. In this chapter we will also deal with the 'Classical Rauzer' (8...Be7).
9.f4 b5 10.Bxf6 gxf6 11.Kb1
6
11...Qb6
11...b4 is another popular move which we will also discuss in this chapter.
12.Nxc6
White can delay this decision by opting for 12.Nce2. Later, he came up with an interesting idea in Saric-Vovk, Douglas 2019 (one of the games selected in this chapter).
12...Bxc6 13.Bd3
White wants his bishop 'out' before moving his knight to e2, but this loses precious time. In the modern treatment of this variation, White takes immediate action with 13.f5 b4 14.Ne2 (see Grischuk-Lupulescu).
13...b4 14.Ne2
7
14...h5!
Black wants his bishop on the h6-c1 diagonal, to stop White's g4, h4, g5 pawn storm. White now needs his knight on h5, playing something like h4, Ng3, Qe2 (or Be2) followed by Nxh5, but with 13.Bd3 White has lost time and getting this done proves difficult. White now needs to be careful to keep the balance!
15.Rhf1?!
Nigel Short was not the only strong player (by far) to aim for a wrong plan here; I will give a few other examples. Likely, White's best move is 15.f5!, but after
15...Bh6 he needs to find the right follow-up!
8 We have examples of two strong players who got in the same kind of trouble Nigel Short did in the game: A) The seemingly forced move 16.Qe1? puts White in a horrible situation: 16...e5 and just like in our main game, White's knight has no future and he has no active play. Black's plan is relatively obvious: place the king on e7, connecting rooks (the king will be safe there), then at some stage or immediately start pushing his pawns on the queenside, creating a frontal attack. 17.Bc4 (17.Ng3 h4 18.Nf1 Ke7 was seen in Kryvoruchko-Ivanchuk, Tromsø 2013. White would love to play Ne3-Nd5, but how?? Black had a clear advantage and went on to win) 17...Ke7 18.b3. White's bishop is well placed, but this is far from enough for any serious counterplay here. Kozul now found a beautiful idea to lock up White's knight: 18...Rag8 (your engine will tell you that the pawn can be taken: 18...Bxe4μ) 19.Ng3 h4 20.Nh5
20...Bg5! 21.g4. With White's knight safely locked up on h5, Black is effectively a
piece up and switches the action back to the queenside: 21...Rc8 22.Qe2 Bb5! (Black's 'effective piece up situation' becomes more pronouced) 23.Bxb5 axb5
24.Rd5 Rc5 25.Qf2 Rhc8 and the rook enters while White is helpless. Black soon
won in Morovic-Kozul, Solin 1999; B) 16.Nf4!!. This solution keeps a dynamic balance! 16...e5 and now White has a tactical idea worth remembering; 17.Bc4! analysis diagram B1) Greed is not good here! After 17...Bxf4?? 18.Qxd6 Black's sitation is terrible. He can't coordinate his pieces, so White has plenty of time to conduct his attack, which is devastating! A couple of sample lines: B11) 18...Rh7 19.Bd5 Rc8 20.Qxf6 and Black is tied up, while White has multiple threats - either 21. g3 or 21. Bxf7+ Rxf7 22. Qe6+; B12) 18...Qb7 19.Qxf6 Rh7 20.Qd6 or 20.Rhe1, both winning; B13) 18...Rh6 19.Bd5 and Black loses material, e.g. 19...Rc8 20.Bxf7+ Kxf7
21.Qe6+ Kg7 22.Qxc8+-.
B2) 17...Bxe4 18.Qe2 Bxc2+ 19.Qxc2 Bxf4 and White has light-square domination and compensation for his sacrificed material. How much compensation? Well... my engine gives zeros.
15...a5
White continues on the wrong path!
16.f5?
Clearly overestimating the weakness of the d5-square.
16...e5
White has succeeded in weakening the d5-square, but at what price? His Ne2 is a problem child. The ideal h5-square is impossible to reach here! White now spends time hoping to improve his knight while Black builds up an attack risk-free.
17.Ng1
17.Bc4 Qc5 18.Bd5 does not help White, as after 18...Bxd5 19.Qxd5 Qxd5 20.Rxd5
Rg8! he loses material: 21.g3 Rg4 and Black wins a pawn (to start with) while White's light-square domination will be temporary.
17...Qc5 18.Qe2 a4
Black has a risk-free textbook Rauzer attack.
19.Bc4
The queen trade does not bring White salvation as Black is much better after 19.Qf2 Bh6 or 19...Qxf2 20.Rxf2 Bh6.
19...Ke7!
Black's king is safe while his rooks are connected and ready to attack.
20.Nh3
The unfortunate knight is still looking for employment.
20.Bd5 does not help; the endgame after 20...Bb5 21.Qf2 Rc8 22.Qxc5 Rxc5 23.Rf2
Bh6 is hopeless for White (Black's bishop pair rules!).
20...Bh6 21.Rf3 Rhc8
Next to activating his rook, Black also has a direct threat - 22...Bxe4.
22.b3
This typical Rauzer move secures White's bishop position but compromises his king.
22...axb3 23.cxb3 Ra3
A mating net around is woven around White's king and typical Rauzer tactics occur. White is already beyond salvation. Black has a devastating attack, and the knight on h3 will never enter the battle.
24.Rfd3
On 24.Qd3 Black has different ways to win, I would like to show some mating ideas worth remembering. Pay attention to the importance of the Bh6! 24...Rxa2! (or
24...Rca8 25.Rf2; Black's Bh6 is a great piece, while White is a 'piece down' with
his Nh3, which makes all the difference: 25....Be3 26.Re2 Bd4 27.Rdd2 Bc3! 28.Rc2 and the mating net has been woven! 28...Bb5! 29.Bxb5 Rxb3+-+) 25.Kxa2. White's king has no protection but Black needs to be precise: 25...d5! (to eliminate Qxd6)
26.exd5 Qa5+ 27.Kb1 Ra8-+
24...Rca8 25.Re1
25.Qxh5 delivers just 'one empty check' 25...Bxe4! 26.Qxf7+ Kd8-+
25...Qa7
25...Bxe4 also wins; after 26.Qxe4 Rxa2 27.Qb7+ Kd8 White has no more checks
while his king is caught.
26.Qxh5 Be8 27.Qxh6 Rxa2
28.Rd2?
Most likely White was in severe time pressure as this makes Black's job really easy. The best practical chance by far was 28.Rxd6!, forcing Black to find a precise sequence of moves: 28...Rb2+! 29.Kxb2 Qa2+ 30.Kc1 Qa1+ 31.Kd2 Ra2+ 32.Ke3. analysis diagram Now Black needed to find a last precise check: 32...Qc3+!! 33.Rd3 (or 33.Bd3 Qd2+
34.Kf3 when Black can afford the luxury to take everything: 34...Qxg2+! 35.Ke3
Qd2+ 36.Kf3 Qxh6) 33...Qxe1+ and again White loses everything: 34.Kf3 Qe2+
35.Kg3 Qxg2+ 36.Kh4 Qxe4+ etc.
28...Rxd2
The game has been concluded.
29.Qxd2 Qa1+ 30.Kc2 Ra2+ 31.Kd3 Qd4+
White resigned. Game 2 Hou Yifan 2612 Li Chao 2656 Danzhou 2011
1.e4 c5 2.Ne2 Nc6 3.d4 cxd4 4.Nxd4 Nf6 5.Nc3 d6 6.Bg5 e6 7.Qd2 a6 8.O-O-O Bd7
9.f4 b5 10.Bxf6 gxf6 11.Kb1 b4
11...Qb6 is another main move here which we will encounter in other games in this
chapter.
12.Nce2 Qb6
13.Qe1
Currently the most popular move is 13.Nxc6 as for example in the game Grischuk- Lupulescu, Bucharest 2021. Another possibility is to aim for an immediate determination of the central pawn structure with 13.f5 when after 13...e5 14.Nxc6 Bxc6 15.Ng3 we have a typical situation where White tries to make use of his knight by bringing it to the attacking h5-square and Black tries to stop this: 15...h5 16.h4. White should now indeed aim to collect the pawn on h5, however this takes time. We have here another instructive example of a (very) strong player going wrong very quickly and getting in serious trouble: 16...Qc5 (readers interested in opening theory should investigate the pawn sacrifice 16...Bh6 17.Qxd6 Rd8 18.Qxd8+ Qxd8 19.Rxd8+ Kxd8 20.Bxa6. analysis diagram Black is active and now gains back some of his sacrificed material: 20...Rg8 21.Rh3 Bf4. We already have some grandmaster-level games here and there will probably be further theoretical discussion. It seems to me that Black is active enough to hold a draw) 17.b3?!. This 'bishop improvement move' (planning Bc4) is typical but not White's best here; principled and critical is the immediate pawn grab 17.Qe2! Ke7 18.Nxh5. After the text, Black went for the typical king improvement 17...Ke7! and now Ponomariov took a strange decision (not following up on his previous move) with 18.Bd3? (for better or worse, White had to follow up on his previous move and develop 18.Bc4)
18...Bh6 19.Qe1. Ruslan understood the trouble he'd got himself into and took
advantage of the 'respect element' by offering a draw which was accepted in Ponomariov-Blehm, Ohrid 2001. In reality, Black has a winning advantage here! Similiar to Short-Kozul and our main game, White is much too late creating active play while Black has a simple and straightforward attack. To give an idea of the trouble Ponomariov was in, after the simple 19...a5 (starting a straight attack) my Stockfish 15 (at serious depth) evaluates the position as close to minus four!!
13...h5
I will give another instructive example of a (very) strong player quickly getting himself in terrible trouble by playing 'logical' moves: 13...Rc8 14.Nxc6 Bxc6
15.Nd4 Bb7.
White is in a hurry to fix the central pawn structure but his timing is wrong: 16.f5? (it was better to keep the centre flexible and opt for 16.Bd3) 16...e5 (Black is already better) 17.Nf3 Rg8 18.Qh4? (this queen sortie, aiming to win a pawn, loses precious time; however it was already hard to give White any god advice. Similar to Short- Kozul, White's problem child is his knight and perhaps the best decision was to try to improve it with 18.Nd2 a5 19.Nc4 Qc5. White has trouble to find a good follow- up plan but this is probably better for him than the game) 18...Ke7! (as usual, Black's king is safe on e7!) 19.Rg1 (now, 19.Nd2 does not make sense due to
19...Qd4).
In order to get a strong attack, Black needs to develop his Bf8 and Kozul uses this moment to get it done: 19...h5!. A) The pawn cannot be taken as after 20.Qxh5 Bxe4 21.Bd3 Bxd3 22.Rxd3 (22.cxd3 allows 22...b3) 22...Qc5 White has no good defence; his pieces have terrible coordination. 23.Rd2. To get the job done Black needs his Bf8 and now is the moment: 23...Bh6! with a winning advantage: 24.Qxh6 Rh8 25.Qg7 Rcg8 and Black should easily convert his material advantage; B) 20.Bd3 Bh6! with his dark-squared bishop in play, Zdenko Kozul has a similar situation as against Nigel Short. A brutal frontal on White's king starts! 21.g3 a5
22.Rg2 a4 23.Re2 b3! (simple, straight and strong! The pawn defences in front of
White's king are destroyed with his queen sleeping on h4 and the Nf3 also out of play. An excellent example of things gone terribly wrong without having made any obvious mistake!) 24.a3 Black has various ways to annihilate White here: A) 24...Rc3 25.Qxh5 Rb8 26.Qxh6 bxc2+ 27.Rxc2 A1) 27...Ba6?. Spoiling a beautifully played game. After 28.Qd2 Rxd3 29.Qxd3 Bxd3 30.Rxd3 Black was still better but now there is a lot of work to be done; he basically had to win the game a second time. It took another 64 moves, Black eventually converting his advantage into a full point in Shirov-Kozul, Heraklio 2007; A2) He could have executed a similar idea with much more effect with 27...Bxe4! and compared to the game White has no e4-pawn: 28.Qd2 (28.Qc1 loses to
28...Rxd3 29.Rxd3 Bxd3) 28...Rxd3 29.Qxd3 Bxd3 30.Rxd3 (now White loses a
piece) 30...e4 31.Re2 Kf8. B) Also strong was 24...bxc2+ 25.Bxc2 (in case of 25.Rxc2 Rxc2 26.Bxc2 Rb8, b2 cannot be protected) 25...Ba6 26.Rg2 Rc3 and Black wins in a few moves.
14.Nxc6 Bxc6
Now White commits a mistake (known to us already) by hurrying to fix the pawn centre at the wrong moment.
15.f5?
White had to keep the tension (and keep the central pawn structure flexible!) with
15.Nd4 Bb7 16.Bc4 with probably some advantage.
15...e5 16.Qh4
Black happily improves his king:
16...Ke7!
Only two seemingly logical moves and yet such a dramatic change! Similar to Short- Kozul or Shirov-Kozul, Black gets an unstoppable, brutal frontal attack on White's king. White takes the best decision and continues his pawn-grab plan.
17.Ng3
To make his attack a crushing one, Black needs his dark-squared bishop, and now is the time.
17...Bh6! 18.Nxh5 Bg5 19.Qg4
The pawn gain is small consolation for White's troubles. Black gets a deadly attack.
19...Qc5 20.h4 Be3 21.Rh3
Time for the standard pawn roll:
21...a5
White tries to bring her Q&N back into play but will not be in time.
22.Qf3 Bd4 23.Ng3 Rhc8
White still needs a lot of time to coordinate her pieces, The situation cannot be saved. Black has various sacrificial ideas, most of them based on the weak white king (the pawn defences can easily be destroyed), the Rh3, Ng3 being totally out of play (in essence, Black has a material advantage) and the white king having no real defenders while Black attacks with all his pieces (the attackers & defenders ratio!). The execution is beautiful and brutal!
24.Rd2
On 24.Bd3, Black has an execution that is typical for these positions (try to remember the ideas!) 24...b3! 25.cxb3 a4 26.Bc4 (the pawn defences need to be destroyed) 26...Bxb2! 27.Kxb2 axb3 28.Bxb3 Qa3+ 29.Kb1 Ba4 analysis diagram and White either gets mated or suffers decisive material loss: 30.Bxa4 (or 30.Ne2 Bxb3 31.Qxb3 Rcb8) 30...Qxa4 and the game may end with a pretty mate: 31.Qe2 Rab8+! 32.Ka1 Qd4+! 33.Rxd4 Rc1#.
24...Bc3
The simple pawn roll 24...a4 followed by 25...b3 should also win. Most likely, Black had already calculated his sacrificial idea.
25.Rd1 Ba4
Another typical sacrificial idea was 25...Bxb2 26.Kxb2 Ba4 and Black has a winning advantage as to prevent mate White will lose decisive material.
26.b3
Now follows an 'instructive destruction'. Black sacrifices first a bishop and then a rook to destroy the white king's pawn defences.
26...Bxb3! 27.cxb3 a4 28.Bc4 axb3 29.Bxb3
Now the rook is sacrificed:
29...Rxa2!!
White's material advantage of R+N is 'sleeping' on the wrong side of the board.
30.Bxa2
30.Kxa2 runs into a forced mate: 30...Qa5+ 31.Kb1 Qa1+ 32.Kc2 Be1+! 33.Kd3
Qa6+ 34.Bc4 Rxc4 35.Ke2 Rxe4#. Now Black 'cleans up' the road to annihilation of White's king:
30...b3! 31.Bxb3 Qa3 32.Kc2 Qb2+ 33.Kd3
Precision is still needed! Black has only one move that wins.
33...Ba5! 34.Bc4
Now White's last defender needs to be destroyed:
34...Rxc4! 35.Ne2
35.Kxc4 runs into checkmate: 35...Qc2+ 36.Kb5 Qc5+ - a beautiful example of a
king chase. The whole army of white pieces is 'sleeping' on the wrong side of the board while White's 'active' king is fighting on his own.
35...Qc2+ 36.Ke3 Bb6+
And White resigned. The next two examples are related to the Kozul Variation in the Rauzer. Understanding the specifics of this variation (doubled f-pawns for Black) in relation to the Classical Rauzer with doubled f-pawns is essential for anyone willing to master these positions on either side of the board. I have tried to give good examples and accompany them with some theoretical information. Favourable situations for White I have tried to give a number of dynamic/strategic examples in my comments to the next two games. However, the two diagrammed positions are typical 'favourable situations for White'. One diagram is with light-squared bishops, the other is without, but both positions are favourable for White because the knight on h5 is excellently placed, helping the attack on Black's king. The pawn push g4-g5 will open the position, Black's king is not safe now on e7 (tactics work for White here) and Black is slow with his attack while White is ready to unleash a storm. Decisive light-square domination At the start of this chapter we saw a few examples of strong GMs as White playing 'logical moves' and getting into terrible trouble. However, it is also very easy to get into a hopeless situation as Black without doing anything particularly stupid. This game is a good example. Game 3 Alexander Grischuk 2776 Constantin Lupulescu 2656 Bucharest 2021
1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 d6 3.d4 cxd4 4.Nxd4 Nf6 5.Nc3 Nc6 6.Bg5 Bd7 7.Qd2 a6 8.O-O-O e6
9.f4 b5 10.Bxf6 gxf6 11.Kb1 Qb6 12.Nxc6 Bxc6 13.f5
Understanding the dynamics of these Rauzer positions with doubled f-pawns has a lot to do with the right timing of transformations in the central pawn structure (when to allow/decide on f5 followed by fxe6, when to block the centre by pushing ...e5). Black now decides to fix the central pawn structure by pushing ...e5.
13...b4
A) An alternative is the often-played move 13...h5 when we can get a totally different pawn structure: 14.fxe6 fxe6. Black no longer has doubled pawns, however his central pawns can be targets and also Black needs to constantly take into account White's central pawn break/sacrifice e5. Black's queen often comes to the e5-square in those positions and White's ability to remove the queen from there (usually by bringing his knight to d3) determines the assessment of the position. We have many high-level games here. While this is not an opening manual, I will give a few examples that are instructive to understanding the plans on both sides: 15.Bd3 and now: A1) A known pawn sacrifice is 15.Qf4 Qc5! and after 16.Qxf6 Qe5 it has been established (computer engines agree) that Black has enough compensation for the sacrificed pawn. A2) Readers interested in theoretical verdicts should also analyse 15.Qe1: A21) 15.Bd3 O-O-O. Here we see how vulnerable Black's pawns are. White needs to bring his knight to f4 when Black has problems to protect his pawns: 16.Rhf1 (also good for White is the immediate 16.Ne2!. Black can put his queen on e5, but then problems appear on the queenside: 16...Qc5 17.Rhf1 Qe5. Now we see the drawbacks of 15...O-O-O: 18.Qa5! Bb7 19.a4 and White has a large advantage, e.g. 19...b4 20.Qxb4 d5 loses to 21.Qb3 dxe4 22.Bc4) 16...Be7. Now the white knight moves to f4: 17.Ne2! Rde8 18.Nf4 Bd8. It may seem that Black has protected everything, but his problems are only starting: 19.Be2! Bxe4 20.Bxh5 Re7 21.Bf3! Bxf3. White has a safe king and open files for hitting Black's pawns. Black has a weak king and no good way to deal with the problems of the central pawn structure. Here, strongest for White was 22.Rxf3! (the game went 22.gxf3 Rhh7 23.h4 and White had advantage and went on to win in Ivanchuk-Piket, Monaco 1996) when Black does not have a good way to protect his central pawns and his position simply collapses:
22...Rxh2 23.Re3 d5 24.Rde1;
A22) 15...Qc5 (Black wants to bring his queen to e5) 16.Rhf1. A221) It is good to know that in case of 16...Qe5 White has a typical tactic: 17.Nd5! and after 17...exd5 18.exd5 Qxd5 19.Bg6+ Kd7 Black does not get away (cheaply) with a worse opposite-coloured bishops ending as White does not capture on d5 but plays 20.Qa5! and wins. Black's queen is attacked, while 21. Bf5+ is a threat too; A222) 16...Rh6 and now: A2221) 17.e5!? is a typical tactic that works here: 17...dxe5 (in case of 17...f5 White plays 18.Bxf5! exf5 19.Rxf5 d5 20.e6! O-O-O 21.Rxf8 and ends a sound pawn up, e.g.
21...Qxf8 22.e7 Qxe7 23.Qxh6 Kb7 24.Rd4±) 18.Ne4 Qe7 19.Qc3 Rc8 (best for
Black was 19...Bxe4! 20.Bxe4 Rd8 when the engine gives many moves around plus one for White. It looks to me that Black has reasonable chances to hold) 20.Be2! (now White wins material) 20...Bd7 21.Qa5 Kf7 22.Qxa6 (Black cannot prevent another pawn loss) 22...Rc6 23.Qxb5 f5 24.Qb3 Kg7 25.Bb5 and White soon won in Inarkiev-Zhou, China tt 2018; A2222) Still, 17.e5 may not even be the strongest move here. The quiet and often played plan 17.Ne2! Qe5 18.Nf4 looks excellent for White. Black's queen will be removed from e5 and Black will be in big trouble. After 18...Bg7 White has a simple and often-seen plan: bishop goes to c2, knight goes to d3, Black's queen is removed from e5 and as a result his position collapses: 19.c3 h4 20.Bc2 O-O-O 21.Nd3 (this spells big trouble for Black here and in similar positions!) 21...Qxh2 22.Qf2 and Black cannot defend against all the threats. If 22...Kb7, White can simply take material with 23.Nc5+ (your engine will indicate 23.a4 as even stronger: 23...Qg3
24.Qg1 (25.a5 is a terrible threat so Black has to grab on a4) 24...bxa4 25.Nc5+)
23...dxc5 24.Rxd8 with a winning advantage.
A23) Readers interested in theory should note that Black's best (at least in my opinion) is 15...b4! 16.Ne2 Bh6! 17.Qe1 Qc5 with complex play. B) The immediate (not often played) 13...O-O-O!? is interesting to explore as after
14.fxe6 fxe6 15.Bd3 Kb8 16.Rhf1 Be7 17.Ne2
White uses a standard manoeuvre but is not in time to put real pressure on e6:
17...d5! 18.exd5 Rxd5 19.Nf4 Rd6 20.Qe2 e5 with approximate equality and a later
draw in Akopian-Ivanchuk, Warsaw 2003.
14.Ne2 e5 15.Ng3
The situation is unpleasant for Black. White's knight should not be allowed to occupy the h5-square here, but if Black pushes ...h5 himself he must be ready to sacrifice material. Black refrains from sacrificing material and quickly gets a lost position:
15...Qc5
Most likely, Black's best option was to go for 15...h5! and now: A) 16.Bc4 is an interesting idea which however should not work provided Black is not so greedy as to collect a pawn: 16...h4 17.Nf1
17...Qc5! (17...Bxe4? is a mistake as after 18.Qe2 Bxf5 19.Ne3 White gets his pawn
back and obtains good attacking prospects: 19...Be6 20.Qf3 Ra7 21.Bxe6 fxe6
22.Qxf6 Rh6 23.Qf3 and White went on to win in Grischuk-Eliseev, Moscow 2014)
18.Bd5 Rc8 and Black has a great position. His bishop comes to h6, controlling the
h6-c1 diagonal making sure the Nf1 can't get to d5; B) 16.h4 and now: B1) 16...Bh6 17.Qxd6 Rd8 18.Qxd8+ Qxd8 19.Rxd8+ Kxd8 analysis diagram To enter such a position is not an easy decision. Normally speaking we have play for two results and it's not easy to say if (in a human game) White is closer to a win or Black to a draw. Which pawn should White take first? Probably the one on a6:
20.Bxa6 (after 20.Nxh5 Ke7 21.Bd3 Black should cut off the knight's retreat with
21...Rg8! when he has enough compensation to hold a draw; not precise is 21...Be3
22.Ng3 Rg8 23.Nf1 Bh6 24.Rg1 and Black did not have enough compensation,
White went on to win in Saric-Jankovic, Bol 2014) 20...Rg8. This position will be further tested in practice. It's not easy to say if after the relatively forced 21.Rh3 Bf4
22.Nxh5 Rxg2 23.Rh1 Bxe4 24.Bd3 Bxd3 25.cxd3
analysis diagram
25...Be3 26.Nxf6 Bd4 27.b3, in a game between humans White is closer to a win or
Black to a draw; B2) Another way to sacrifice a pawn is 16...Qc5. B21) Peter Svidler, playing White, opted for an instructive (standard) exchange sacrifice idea: 17.Qe2 Ke7 18.Nxh5 Bb5 19.Qg4 Bh6. Does Black have enough compensation? No, he does not. White correctly decided to sacrifice an exchange with 20.Rd5 Qc7 21.Qd1! Bc6 22.Bc4 with a great position. Black survived to a draw in Svidler-Dubov, Moscow 2012; B22) Another way to execute a similar idea is 17.Bd3 Bh6 18.Qe2 Qe3 19.Nxh5! Ke7 (19...Qxe2?? blunders a pawn to 20.Nxf6+ Ke7 21.Bxe2). Here, White should keep the queens on the board: 20.Qf1! Bxe4... analysis diagram ... and now White's best option is to go for the exchange sacrifice 21.g4! (21.Rh3 leads to a drawish endgame after 21...Bxd3 22.Rxd3 Qc1+! 23.Qxc1 Bxc1)
21...Bxh1 22.Qxh1. Due to his light-square domination and Black's weak king
White has plenty of compensation here. Grischuk now opts for an improvement of his bishop that is typical in these Rauzer positions:
16.b3! h5!
Enabling ...Bh6.
17.h4
17...Bb5?
The pawn sacrifice idea suggested under 15...h5 now works less well: 17...Bh6
18.Qxd6 Qxd6 19.Rxd6 Rd8 20.Rxd8+ Kxd8 21.Bxa6 and Black's compensation is
very doubtful. Best for Black was to go for the standard king improvement with 17...Ke7 and after the logical 18.Bc4 Bh6 19.Qe2 Bb5... analysis diagram ... White has the interesting idea (worth remembering!) 20.Rd3! Bxc4 21.bxc4 Rhc8 (21...Qxc4 22.Nxh5 Rhc8 transposes) 22.Nxh5 Qxc4 and now White opts for a standard way to break Black's defences: 23.g4! Rc5 24.Qg2ƒ (it's never too late to do something extremely stupid! 24.Nxf6?? loses to 24...Ra5 25.Nd5+ Kf8 when White's queen is pinned so a2 cannot be defended) 24...Ra5 25.Rb3 and White has a promising attack.
18.Qe1!
A strong move, possibly underestimated by Black.
18...Rc8 19.Bxb5+ axb5 20.Qe2
White's rook comes to d5 with menacing force. In a higher sense, the game is decided. Grischuk executes with a steady hand.
20...Ra8 21.Rd5 Qa7 22.Qxb5+ Kd8
Black's pawn structure is horrible. White's king is safe. Black's bishop is now a perfect example of the 'useless Rauzer bishop' (dominated by White's knight).
23.a4 bxa3 24.Rhd1 Be7
Now it's time to collect the pawn on h5:
25.Qe2! Rc8 26.c4!
Total domination.
26...Rg8 27.Nxh5 a2+ 28.Ka1 Rb8 29.R5d3 Qa3 30.Qc2 Rg4 31.c5
Black is bound to lose more material.
31...Rc8 32.Rc3 d5 33.Rxd5+ Ke8 34.g3
White's knight is perfect on h5 here.
34...Qb4 35.Rc4 Qe1+ 36.Rd1 Qe3 37.Qd3 1-0
Kingside pawn storm, light-square control Game 4 Milos Perunovic 2628 Alojzije Jankovic 2549 Bosnia/Herzegovina tt 2014 I have picked up this game because it showns how brutal White's attack can be if the knight on h5 combines with the g4-g5 pawn push in a good way.
1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 d6 3.d4 cxd4 4.Nxd4 Nf6 5.Nc3 Nc6 6.Bg5 e6 7.Qd2 a6 8.O-O-O Bd7
9.f4 b5 10.Bxf6 gxf6 11.Kb1 b4 12.Nce2 Qb6 13.Nxc6 Bxc6 14.f5 e5 15.Ng3 Qc5
As mentioned in Grischuk-Lupulescu, Black should strongly consider 15...h5 here.
16.Nh5
Grischuk opted for 16.b3 in the abovementioned game.
16...Ke7?
The standard Rauzer king move, based on the belief that Black's king will be safe in the centre. Yes, the king will be safe... unless his pawn defences are broken down. At the time this game was played, 16...Ke7 was considered quite okay for Black. But the direct brutal approach White took in this game 'closed the line'! Black had to opt for 16...Be7 and after 17.Bd3 (17.Qh6 Bxe4 18.Bd3 does not look clear - there are many options) 17...O-O-O! Black wants to push ...d5 when matters are far from clear. This was probably the reason why Grischuk opted for 16.b3. The pawn grab 18.Bxa6+ is risky as after 18...Kc7 Black has the a-file; he wants to push ...d5 and has good compensation.
17.g4!
All the drawbacks of Black's king on e7 are now apparent! Take note that with the white knight on h5 supported by the g4-g5 pawn push, the king is in a grave danger on e7! The tactical idea 17.Bc4 is a mistake as 17...Rg8 stops the g-pawn push and Black's king is suddenly safe on e7. White's wishful thinking is that Black goes for the pawn grab 17...Bxe4? as after 18.Rhe1 Bc6 19.Qf4! White gets a dream scenario: 19...Rg8
20.Qh4 Rg5 21.Nf4! when White's light-square domination, Black's weak king and
his dead bishop on f8 should prove decisive.
17...Rg8
The pawn grab 17...Bxe4? runs into an obvious refutation: 18.Bg2 Bxg2 19.Qxg2 Rc8 20.Rd5 and everything goes 'with the music'. White now uses the fact that Black's queen must protect d6:
18.Rg1!
Black is already in a bad situation and decides to grab a pawn after all.
18...Bxe4
The alternative was 18...Rg5. Now White should not be in a hurry and calmly prepare h4 and g5: 19.Rg3! (Black's idea comes to the sureface after 19.h4 when he sacrifices an exchange and gets some counterplay with 19...Rxh5 20.gxh5. Now Black uses the fact that the Rg1 is hanging: 20...Bh6! 21.Qd3 a5 and Black has survival chances) 19...Bh6 20.Qg2 21.h4 comes and Black is in a bad shape as the exchange sacrifice ...Rxh5 does not work so well here.
19.g5?!
This seemingly direct blow is a mistake here, allowing Black to stay in the game! It was better to opt for light-square domination with 19.Bg2! Bxg2 20.Rxg2 (the alternative is 20.Qxg2 Rc8 21.h3 with 22. Rd5 to follow; the immediate 21.Rd5?? horribly blunders into 21...Rxg4) 20...Rc8 analysis diagram
21.h4! (Black has no counterplay, White has huge domination, but it's important not
to blunder into something stupid like 21.Rg3?? Bh6) 21...h6 22.Rg3. White has a winning advantage. Black's position is about to collapse, e.g. 22...a5 (or 22...d5
23.a3) 23.b3 (23.Rd3? is too hasty and a blunder: 23...Rxg4 24.Rxd6 Rd4!; but
23.Qg2 followed by Rd5 also wins) White wants to play 24. Qg2 followed by Rd5.
Black has no good moves: 23...Qc6 (or 23...d5 24.Qxd5 Qxc2+ 25.Ka1) 24.Rd3 Rxg4 25.Rxd6.
19...fxg5?
Not seizing the sudden opportunity to escape! Black would have been very much back in the game after 19...Rc8! when suddenly the position is about equal: 20.Bd3 (20.gxf6+?? loses to 20...Kd7) 20...Rxg5 21.Rxg5 Bxd3 22.cxd3 fxg5. analysis diagram It's very likely that Black did not go for 19...Rc8! because he simply thought he would be losing here. A) 23.d4 Qc6 is double-edged: 24.dxe5 (24.Qxg5+? is wrong as only Black can be better after 24...f6! 25.Qxf6+ Ke8 26.Qe6+ Kd8 27.Qb3 Qe4+ 28.Ka1 Qxf5)
24...dxe5 25.Qxb4+ (there is no mate after 25.f6+ Ke6) 25...Ke8 26.Qb3 White
probably has sufficient compensation to hold the balance, but not more; B) In reality, after 23.Qxg5+ Black has 23...f6! and the position is about equal
24.Qxf6+ Ke8 25.Qe6+ Kd8. White has to protect against the 26...Qc2+ threat:
26.Qb3 Bh6! (a direct mate is always a respectable threat) 27.Qg8+ Kc7=.
20.Rg4
Now the game ends with a brutal annihilation!
20...Bf3 21.Rc4 Qb6 22.Rxb4 Qc6
Or 22...Qc5 23.f6+ Ke8 24.Rc4 Qb6 25.Be2. Black has a weak king and is unable to coordinate his pieces: 25...g4 26.Rc3 (White has all the time in the world; the calm
26.a3 also wins) 26...Rb8 27.b3 and Black will collapse in a few moves.
23.Rb7+! Kd8 24.Qa5+ Kc8 25.Rb6 Qc7 26.Bxa6+
White can choose how to win here. Another way was 26.Rd3 Bxh5 27.Rc3.
26...Bb7 27.Bxb7+ Qxb7 28.Qc3+ 1-0
Flexibility and the rook lift Another idea for White is a third rank rook lift, which is not often seen. Game 5 Ivan Saric 2667 Andrey Vovk 2618 Douglas 2019
1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.d4 cxd4 4.Nxd4 Nf6 5.Nc3 d6 6.Bg5 e6 7.Qd2 a6 8.O-O-O Bd7
9.f4 b5 10.Bxf6 gxf6 11.Kb1 Qb6
I have picked up this game because White came up with a nice idea: keeping his central situation flexible while coming with an instructive rook lift. To my knowledge, the originator of the idea is Serbian/Turkish GM Dragan Solak.
12.Nce2!?
White is flexible. The knight is pre-emptively moved away from the ...b4 tempo while most options have been preserved. Black decides on a standard Rauzer move:
12...h5
Black can of course also continue the standard plan and push his b-pawn (as if White's knight was still on c3): 12...b4. White can now choose between different options created by the flexible 12.Nce2!?: A) 13.Nxc6 Bxc6 14.f5 can transpose into known lines after 14...e5 (the pawn grab
14...Bxe4? is not a good idea: 15.fxe6 fxe6 16.Qf4 d5 17.Ng3 Bg6 (17...e5? 18.Qh4
only causes more trouble for Black) 18.Qxf6 Rg8 19.Bd3 - White has got his pawn back and has a clear advantage) 15.Ng3 h5 16.h4 and now Black can go for a pawn sac line (as mentioned in Grischuk-Lupulescu): 16...Bh6 17.Qxd6 Rd8 18.Qxd8+ Qxd8 19.Rxd8+ Kxd8 20.Bxa6 and the verdict is still open whether, in a human game, White is closer to a win or Black to a draw here; B) White can still follow the rook lift plan 13.h4 h5 14.Rh3 with some advantage as in Saric-Li Chao, chess.com blitz 2020; C) Another option is to changie the kingside pawn structure in a different way by pushing the g-pawn: 13.g4!?. If Black does not challenge him, White will continue pushing his kingside pawns: h4, g5: 13...h5 14.g5 fxg5 15.fxg5 (if Black consolidates, he will be doing very well positionally, but White has the 'momentum') 15...Nxd4 16.Nxd4 Qc5. analysis diagram Ivan Cheparinov exploited White's momentum with 17.g6! fxg6 18.Qg2 Rg8 19.e5! d5. analysis diagram Black still needs to spend time solving his king problem as queenside castling loses the important pawn on a6 (and with check). Strongest for White here seems to be
20.Bd3! (the game Cheparinov-Czarnota, Warsaw 2017, continued 20.Be2 and now
Black had to continue with 20...Qb6 21.Bxh5 O-O-O with ...Bc5 to follow and a dynamically balanced game; that game was later drawn) when Black's situation is far from easy. Castling queenside loses the pawn on a6 with check while White wants to start collecting pawns on the kingside: 20...Be7! (20...a5? loses to the prosaic 21.Qg5 Be7 22.Bxg6+ Kd8 23.Qxh5) 21.Rhf1 a5 (in the event of 21...Qb6 White has the tactical motif 22.Bxg6+ Kd8 23.Nf5!). analysis diagram Now White has a promising exchange sacrifice: 22.Rf6! Bxf6 23.Bxg6+ Kd8
24.exf6 with f7 to follow and Black will struggle to make a draw.
13.h4 O-O-O
In case of (perhaps Black's best move) 13...b4! White should reiterate on the rook lift idea with 14.Rh3!, with some advantage - note that, now or slightly later, taking space with the 15. c4 pawn push becomes interesting. It is also good to notice that on 14.Nxc6 Bxc6 15.f5 ... analysis diagram ... Black's pawn sacrifice 15...Bh6! 16.Qxd6 Rd8 17.Qxd8+ Qxd8 18.Rxd8+ Kxd8 now works very well! Black has full compensation and only he can be better, e.g.
19.fxe6 Ke7 20.Nd4 (White has problems developing after 20.exf7 Rd8) 20...Bxe4.
With Black's king already castled, White's rook lift gains in power.
14.Rh3! Kb8 15.Nxc6+ Bxc6
Black's king is a clear target.
16.Rb3!
Black's situation is critical. White's plan is obvious: 17.Nd4 followed by 18.a4. Black hopes to get counterplay using a pawn break:
16...d5
The pawn grab 16...Bxe4? leads to a disaster after 17.Nd4 (18.Bxb5 is a direct threat) 17...Rc8 (or 17...Bb7 18.a4) 18.a4 Ka8 19.Bxb5! axb5 20.Rxb5 Qc7 and now a second rook lift kills Black: 21.Re1! Bb7 22.Re3.
17.Nd4 Bb7
18.e5!
At first glance, 18.exd5 Rxd5 19.c4 looks winning for White, but Black has a defensive resource in 19...Rd6 20.cxb5 Bd5! and matters are far from clear.
18...fxe5
Fixing the centre with 18...f5? is a bad idea because White continues his queenside action undisturbed: 19.a4 (White is also much better after a calm useful move like
19.g3) 19...b4 20.c3 a5 21.Bb5.
19.fxe5 Rg8
Black activates his rook, hoping for counterplay. In reality Black's counterplay here is far from real (i.e., far from sufficient) and White has a close to winning advantage. If Black plays 19...Rc8, White can opt for 20.a4 b4 21.Be2 when the black pawns h5 and f7 are obvious targets. I do not know if he was still in his home preparation or if he found it over the board, but Ivan Saric comes up with an improvement on a top game played two years earlier.
20.a4!
Direct and strong (not giving Black 'a break'). In the stem game White went for the less precise 20.g3. Black sacrificed a pawn hoping for counterplay: 20...Rg4 (better was 20...Qc7! and Black gets counterplay without sacrificing anything: 21.Qe3 (21.a4? is just wrong here due to the simple
21...bxa4) 21...Bc5) White correctly collected the pawn: 21.Be2! (Black would have
achieved his counterplay after 21.a4 Bc5) 21...Re4 22.Bxh5 Rd7 (White decides to collect the f7-pawn) 23.Rf3 (strong was 23.Bf3 Rxe5 24.a4 b4 25.h5 when White's h-passer is dangerous while Black's Re5 is clumsy) 23...Bc5 24.Nb3 Be3 25.Qd3 d4. Optically Black's situation has improved, however his counterplay should not have had been sufficient: 26.Rxf7 Rxf7 27.Bxf7 Rg4 (27...Rxe5 loses to 28.Bg6 after which White will play a3 and combine the power of his h-passer with targeting Black's d4-pawn) 28.Bg6 Qc7 (28...Rxg3 29.h5 looks excellent for White) A) 29.c3. This lets a deserved win slip. Black replied 29...Qxe5 30.cxd4 (Black should also hold in the ending resulting after 30.Nxd4 Bxd4 31.cxd4 Qxg3
32.Qxg3+ Rxg3 33.h5 Kc7) and now got serious counterplay with 30...Qxg3 31.h5
Qf2, 32... Rg2 or 32... Rg1 being threats, and a draw was agreed in Solak-Ivanchuk, Turkey tt 2017; B) Strong was 29.h5! Qxe5 30.Qf1!, combining the power of his passer with the motif of the weak black king, e.g. 30...Rxg3 31.Qf8+ Ka7. Now best for White is to rule out back-rank tactics with 32.a3 when Black's situation is considerably worse then it may look at first glance. White's h-passer is strong, Black's king is weak -
33.Nc5 or 33.Na5 is coming - and in computer language White is at around plus
three.
20...b4 21.g3
Black attempts to get counterplay similar to Ivanchuk in the above game vs Solak, but he is in a worse situation.
21...Rg4
The alternative 21...Qc7 does not help as White targets Black's pawns while also eliminating counterplay with ...Rg4 with 22.Be2 when 22...Qxe5? fails to the prosaic
23.Bxa6.
22.Be2 Re4 23.Bxh5 Rd7 24.Rf3
The situation is similar to Solak-Ivanchuk, however Black's situation is worse as the inclusion of 20.a4 b4 helps White.
24...Bg7 25.Rxf7 Rxf7 26.Bxf7 Bxe5 27.Nxe6
Black hopes to open a route to some checks and a miracle save:
27...b3 28.cxb3 Bxg3
White calculates a tactical win.
29.Nf8
29.h5 was winning too.
29...Re7
29...Qxb3 loses to 30.Nd7+ Ka7 31.Nc5.
30.Bxd5 Bc8 31.h5 Bg4 32.Qg5! Qb4
33.Ne6! Re8
33...Bxd1 34.Qxg3+ Ka7 (34...Kc8 35.Qg8+ Kd7 36.Qd8#) 35.Qg1+.
34.Nd4 1-0
Classical Rauzer positions The last part of this chapter is about Classical Rauzer positions in which Black has doubled f-pawns. The Classical Rauzer is enjoying a renaissance and is indeed a great weapon for Black to play for a win. The main difference compared to the Kozul Variation is that here Black already has his bishop developed on e7 while White has committed his knight to f3. While many ideas for Black in the Kozul Variation are based on the advantages of Black's bishop still being on its initial square (f8), f3 is not a square White is happy to place his knight on in these lines. The ensuing positions are dynamically balanced, however it is easy to make mistakes. The examples I have chosen show White executing his basic strategic idea in this pawn structure while Black needs to be smart with his pawn break and the timing of dynamics to get adequate counterplay. A typical dynamic situation in the Classical Rauzer. White has achieved his strategic regrouping and is hitting on Black's e6-weakness. Black can't say 'pass' and has to react, relying on pawn breaks and tactics. The position is objectively dynamically balanced but it's easy for either side to go wrong. Classical Rauzer plans, pawn breaks, dynamics Now we will investigate the dynamics in what was formerly considered the main line in the Rauzer with doubled f-pawns. Game 6 Markus Ragger 2701 Ivan Salgado Lopez 2624 Germany Bundesliga 2018/19
1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.d4 cxd4 4.Nxd4 Nf6 5.Nc3 d6 6.Bg5 e6 7.Qd2 a6 8.O-O-O Bd7
9.f4 Be7
White now retreats his knight in order to have pressure on the d6-pawn and hence force Black to recapture 11...gxf6.
10.Nf3 b5 11.Bxf6 gxf6
Compared to our previous games with the Kozul Variation (like Grischuk-Lupulescu or Saric-Vovk), the white knight is on f3 instead of d4 and the black bishop is on e7 instead of f8. One may wonder whether it wouldn't be useful for Black to have made an extra move (like ...Qb6, for example) and have the bishop still on f8 (so that this bishop can be deployed to the active h6-post)? The answer is yes, such a development would indeed have been useful for Black. However, in the Kozul Variation White does not voluntarily play Nf3 while here White has to if he wants to force the recapture with the pawn on f6. To expect White to voluntarily play Nf3 in the Kozul Variation is a bit of wishful thinking.
12.Kb1 Qb6
We have a typical Classical Rauzer position with doubled f-pawns, and this is a good moment to explain the basic plans. White would like to force Black to play ...e5 at the wrong (for Black) moment and seize control of the d5-square (and also the f5-square). How is White going to achieve this? White will push f5, followed by g3, Bh3, and then further increases the pressure on Black's e6-pawn by taking fxe6. After Black recaptures ...fxe6, White moves the Nc3 to the f4-square (Nc3-e2-f4) and often (as Black will likely look for activity and move his Nc6) place his other knight on d4. Black will not be able to conveniently defend his e6-pawn and will be forced to react by weakening his pawn structure. This plan does not sound very complicated, so how is Black supposed to react? He needs to counter with a pawn break - normally either ...f5 or ...d5. This usually amounts to a (temporary) pawn sacrifice. The position opens up and the power of Black's bishop pair is unleashed! Black should also utilize the c-file and he has knight sacrifice motifs too. My impression is that Black needs to be inventive and time his pawn breaks well. The objective assessment is probably 'dynamically balanced'. Let's see how this works in practice.
13.f5 O-O-O 14.g3
White follows the above-mentioned plan; Black wants to get active.
14...Na5!?
Readers interested in the opening theory of this line, please take note! This little- played move is worth investigating and in my opinion gives Black adequate counterplay.
14...Kb8 is more often played and is according to current theory Black's main move
here.
15.Bh3 Nc4
16.Qe2!
White takes away a square from his own knight (the Nc3-e2-f4 plan), but for a good reason! On e2, the queen hits the Nc4 and (temporarily) stops ...b4. Let's see what happens if White plays the seemingly more logical 16.Qe1. First, Black gets ready to utilize the c-file and moves his king to a better square: 16...Kb8. Now White hits on the e6-weakness: 17.fxe6 fxe6. analysis diagram A) White can try the standard knight manoeuvre to f4: 18.Ne2? but won't get it done due to tactical reasons: 18...d5! (a typical pawn break/sacrifice) 19.exd5 e5
20.Bxd7 Rxd7 21.g4 (White controls the light squares but his king will be left
without defenders!) 21...Rc8 22.Ng3. analysis diagram Now Black has a typical sacrifice to destroy White's pawn defences: 22...Ba3!
23.bxa3 Nxa3+ 24.Kb2 Rxc2+ 25.Ka1 b4! and White is helpless against various
threats, 26... b3 being the most scary; B) 18.Nd4 b4 19.Nce2 analysis diagram Black is forced to react, but he does not mind because he has a great (typical) pawn break: 19...f5! 20.exf5 e5 21.Ne6 Bxe6 22.fxe6. analysis diagram Black has a great position and can choose between the sacrificial option and 'easy play': 22...Na3+ (the 'easy' option is 22...d5. Black is only a pawn down and has a great (advancing) pawn centre and plenty of threats, which is definitely more than 'just compensation') 23.bxa3 bxa3+ 24.Kc1 Rc8. White is under a severe attack, though your engine will tell you that he is likely to survive after 25.Rd2.
16...Rhe8
Defending e6 and bringing the rook into play. 16...Kb8 now works less well for Black and in the following variations we see the power of White's forces: 17.fxe6 fxe6 18.Nd4, hitting the pawn on e6 while Black does not have a convenient pawn break. He has to opt for defence: 18...Qc5 19.Rd3! (now White does threaten to take on e6) 19...Qc8 analysis diagram
20.Rhd1! (preparing an exchange sacrifice) 20...Ne5 21.a4! (opening the queenside
after which Black's king becomes a target; here we see motifs similar to Saric-Vovk)
21...Nxd3 22.Rxd3 b4.
analysis diagram White continues his power play: 23.Bxe6! Bxe6 24.Nd5!. White is a full rook down, but the black king has no defenders. A) 24...Bg4 25.Qf1 Bh3 does not save Black due to 26.Qf3 Bg4 27.Qf4 Rhe8
28.Nxb4 and White has a winning attack;
B) 24...Rhe8, trying to keep the material, does not help since Black's king is too weak. However, a precise execution is needed: 25.Nxe6 Qxe6 26.Rb3! Rd7 27.Nxb4 Rb7 28.Nc6+ Kc7 29.Rc3 and White wins; C) Best for Black is to return material and accept an inferior position with 24...Bxd5
25.exd5 Rhe8 26.Nc6+ Ka8 27.Nxe7 when White is only an exchange down and has
full domination. White now puts extra pressure on e6:
17.Nd4 Bf8 18.Qh5 b4
Now the other knight goes to f4, putting extra pressure on e6.
19.fxe6 fxe6 20.Nce2 Kb8 21.Nf4
A critical moment! White has accomplished his plan. Black cannot defend his e6- pawn and cannot say 'pass' either, so he needs to find a tactical remedy. Ivan Salgado comes up with a beautiful idea which unfortunately doesn't work against White's best defence. Black takes the right decision to go for a pawn break!
21...f5!
Black did have the alternative to opt for a sacrificial motif that is useful to remember: 21...Rc8!?. White has to grab the pawn: 22.Bxe6 Bxe6 23.Nfxe6. analysis diagram The Nd4 is a defender and in order for Black's tactical idea to work it needs to be removed: 23...Rxe6! 24.Nxe6. Now Black has his tactic: 24...Na3+ 25.bxa3 (White could change his mind and agree to a draw with 25.Ka1 Nxc2+ 26.Kb1 Na3+)
25...bxa3+ 26.Kc1.
analysis diagram There is no mate - Black doesn't even come close, so he should try to get his material back: 26...Qe3+! 27.Rd2 Qc3 28.Kd1! Qa1+ 29.Ke2 Qxh1 with a very unusual position in which the silicon brain prefers White.
21...d5?? is a wrong break as it simply loses material for nothing after 22.exd5.
22.exf5
22...Nxb2!?
An exclamation mark for the courage and beauty of the idea; a question mark because this sacrifice should not have worked. The position is objectively equal; we have a dynamic balance. The lines are very sharp and it's easy to err. There are entire labyrinths of variations here. I will give some variations that look plausible to me for humans to play - while, of course, I did check the position with Stockfish 15 and 'equal' is the correct verdict. This position is also excellently suited to use as an excellent calculation exercise. A) It is good to note that 22...Bg7? doesn't work due to 23.fxe6 Bxd4 when Black is not in time to execute his 24... Na3+ threat: analysis diagram
24.Qd5! Bc6 25.Qxc4 Bxh1 26.Rxh1. The smoke has cleared; material is equal,
however White has full domination and a safer king. White has a winning advantage; B) Black's best move is 22...e5. The response is forced: 23.Nd5 Qb7 and here White has a choice. analysis diagram B1) 24.Nb3 leads to equality (after some complications) as White cannot keep his Nd5 in the centre: 24...Bc6 25.Bg2 e4. Now the knight has to move: 26.Nf6 (Black has strong compensation after 26.Nf4 Bg7; for the price of only one pawn he has attacking motifs, the bishop pair, dynamic central pawns... obvious compensation)
26...Qg7. White is quite fortunate to maintain equality here: 27.Nd4 Qxf6 28.Nxc6+
Kc7 analysis diagram
29.Rd4! (29.Nd4 Bh6 looks promising for Black) 29...d5 30.Rxc4! dxc4 31.Nxd8
Rxd8 32.Qe2 Rd4. White has an extra pawn, but Black has mating threats on the h8- a1 diagonal. The position is not easy to assess at first glance; Stockfish gives zeros after 33.g4 Bg7 34.Rc1! Qe5; B2) However, critical looks 24.Ne6 and here Black is at a crossroads: B21) The first candidate move a human player will probably try to evaluate is
24...Na3+. Please test yourself and evaluate the outcome of this sacrifice.
analysis diagram
25.Kc1 (25.Ka1 Nxc2+ 26.Kb1 Na3+ 27.Ka1 is a draw while 25.bxa3 bxa3+ 26.Kc1
Rc8! transposes to 25.Kc1). Black needs to increase the pressure here by forcing White to capture the knight: 25...Rc8! 26.bxa3 bxa3. The white king needs defenders: 27.Ne3! Qb2+ 28.Kd2. analysis diagram B211) 28...Bb5!? is interesting, putting White to the test. However, if White passes the test, he will have the upper hand: 29.Ke1 d5. Black's dark-squared bishop should not be allowed to join the party: 30.Nxf8 d4!. analysis diagram Now White needs to find an active defence, exploiting the weak position of Black's king: 31.Qh6! (31.Nd5? is wrong; after 31...Rxc2 32.Nd7+ Ka7 33.Bf1 Bxd7 Black is clearly better as White has a weak king and his pieces lack coordination) 31...dxe3
32.Qb6+ Ka8 33.Bg2+ e4 34.Qxe3.
analysis diagram Best is to get back the sacrificed piece: 34...Qb4+ (34...Rxc2? is not precise, though it may lead to an entertaining line: 35.Bxe4+ Rxe4 36.Qxe4+ Ka7 37.Qd4+ Kb7. Black has to allow the queen swap, but it's still not over: 38.Qxb2 axb2 39.Rb1! Bc4
40.a3 Ba2 41.Rxb2+ Rxb2 42.Rf1 and White should win this ending) 35.Rd2 Qxf8
36.g4. The position remains very complicated; probably, White is somewhat better;
B212) It looks logical to bring extra forces into the attack with 28...d5. White needs to destroy the potential attacker: 29.Nxf8 Qd4+ 30.Ke2. analysis diagram The king chase continues; however, Black does not have enough attackers to get more than a draw: 30...Rxc2+! 31.Nxc2 Bb5+ 32.Kf3 Qe4+ 33.Kf2 Qxc2+ and it ends in perpetual check: 34.Kg1 Qc5+ 35.Kg2 Qc2+. B22) The second logical candidate move for Black is to place his rook on the c-file, enforcing the ...Na3+ threat: 24...Rc8!?. Again, a great calculation exercise! Test yourself. Calculate & evaluate! Most probably, the severest test for Black is the 'prophylactic defence' 25.Ka1! (25.Nxf8 Na3+ 26.Ka1 Nxc2+ is perpetual check; and White is playing with fire if he opts for 25.Qf3 as after 25...Ba4 Black renews the ...Na3+ threat and the ...Nxb2 threat is added. The position is still dynamically balanced, but I won't bother you with a labyrinth of mainly computer variations). Black needs to be precise to hold the balance: 25...Bc6! 26.Bg2 e4! analysis diagram
27.Nf6! (27.Bxe4? is wrong as the Bf8 joins the attack with devastating effect after
27...Bg7) 27...Ne3! 28.Qe2!. White's Ne6 is annoying, so it makes sense to remove
it: 28...Rxe6 29.fxe6 Nxg2. analysis diagram B221) After 30.Qxg2 Black is active enough to maintain equality: 30...e3 31.Nd5 e2
32.Rd3 Bb5! and now we get a materially inbalanced endgame: 33.Qxe2 Qxd5
34.Rxd5 Bxe2 35.Re1 Bc4.
analysis diagram White has enough pawns; however, Black's bishop pair coordinates well: 36.Rh5 Bg7! 37.Rh4 (or 37.Rxh7 Be5=) 37...Bd5 38.Rxb4+ Kc7. White collects one more pawn: 39.Rh4 Be5 40.Rxh7+ Kc6. White has a material advantage but he cannot hold onto his e-pawn. Black's bishops are coordinating well enough to keep the balance and a draw is the most probable outcome; B222) Another option is 30.Nd7+ Ka8 31.Rhf1, leading to equality! 31...e3!
32.Nxf8 Bb5 33.Rd3 Qc6 White has a passed pawn too, so it makes sense to push it:
34.e7 Qxc2 35.Qxc2 Rxc2.
analysis diagram In this crazy position, Stockfish gives a couple of lines leading to zeros! The most human solution looks to me to be 36.Rg1 e2 37.Rxd6 e1Q+ 38.Rxe1 Nxe1 39.a4 bxa3 and now it becomes obvious that this affair will end peacefully: 40.e8Q+ Bxe8
41.Rd8+ Kb7 42.Rxe8 and a draw is the most likely outcome; for example, 42...Nd3
43.bxa3 Rxh2.
23.Kxb2 Bg7 24.Nfe2 exf5
A critical moment!
25.Kb1
White could have refuted Black's sacrifice by inserting 25.Qf7! Bh8 and now moving the king away: 26.Kb1. The queen on f7 covers the e6-square and covers the g8-a2 diagonal. White now easily fight off Black's attack and his material advantage will prove decisive very soon. Black now shows the nice tactical idea behind his piece sacrifice:
25...Rxe2! 26.Nxe2 Be6
Black has the direct threat 27...Bxa2 and White plays the most logical human move:
27.Nc1
The silicon brain still refutes Black's attack by playing 27.Qg5! Bxa2+ 28.Kc1 Rd7 (or 28...Rg8 29.Qd2!) 29.Bxf5 Qa5 30.Kd2!. Nevertheless, Black can proceed with his plan!
27...Bxa2+! 28.Nxa2
28.Kxa2?? runs into one of various forced mates; for example, 28...Qa5+ 29.Kb3
Qa3+ 30.Kc4 d5+ 31.Kc5 Qa5+ 32.Kc6 Qc7#.
28...b3 29.Nc1 bxc2+
The pawn defences in front of White's king have been removed; however, Black has sacrificed a lot of material to achieve this. Though White's king is in the open and his defenders are scarce, interestingly enough there is no mate.
30.Kxc2 Rc8+ 31.Kd2 Qb4+ 32.Ke2 Qe4+
The king chase is in full swing, but Black does not have enough remaining forces to deliver mate.
33.Kf2 Bd4+ 34.Rxd4 Qxd4+ 35.Kg2 Qe4+ 36.Kf2
Black correctly judges that he doesn't run any risk and keeps playing for a win:
36...Qxh1! 37.Ne2 Qxh2+ 38.Ke3 Qh1 39.Qxf5 Re8+ 40.Kd2 Qe4
The smoke has cleared, the time control has been reached... White has an important decision to make. To trade or not to trade queens?
41.Qxe4?
The wrong decision! The queens should have been kept on the board: 41.Qf2!. Both kings are weak, while one of the basic rules with similar material imbalances says that minor pieces have better coordinating chances vs rook & pawns if there are more pieces on the board, Most probably Black's best option is a draw by perpetual check with 41...Qb4+
42.Kd3 Qb5+.
41...Rxe4 42.Bf5 Re7
White had probably underestimated this ending. His basic problem is that he is unable to trade the kingside pawns. At some stage (as happened in the game) Black will sacrifice an exchange to get three passed pawns vs the knight and White will be unable to stop the pawns. Salgado's plan is clear and the execution does not need any more comments.

1.e4 c5 2.Nc3 d6 3.Nge2 Nc6 4.d4 cxd4 5.Nxd4 Nf6 6.Bg5 e6 7.Qd2 a6 8.O-O-O
Bd7 9.f4 Be7 10.Nf3 b5 11.Bxf6 gxf6 12.f5 Qb6 13.Kb1 O-O-O Just like in Ragger-Salgado, White goes for the current main line.
14.g3
Players interested in finding new ways I can advise to pay attention to 14.Qh6!?.
14...Kb8
Black's main move here. For 14...Na5 see Ragger-Salgado.
15.fxe6 fxe6 16.Bh3 Na5
Arguably, Black's main move here. He has alternatives in 16...Qc5 or 16...Bc8; both moves are tried at high level and should offer Black satisfactory play.
17.Nd4 b4 18.Nce2
We have a standard situation in this line. White has regrouped and has pressure on the e6-pawn. Black cannot ignore this and needs to decide on a pawn break. Max goes for a pawn sacrifice:
18...d5!?
18...e5 is currently considered to be the main theoretical move and has been tried, for
example, in Navara-Saric, Patras 2019. The other pawn break 18...f5?! is not a good idea for Black here, as White limits Black's Na5 and has a clear advantage after the simple 19.b3!±.
19.exd5 e5 20.Bxd7 Rxd7 21.Nf5 Nc4
For his sacrificed pawn Black has obtained decent attacking prospects on White's king.
22.Qd3 Rc8
Probably Tiviakov thought 23...Na3+ was a threat, so he brings his knight closer to his king:
23.Nc1
White could have played 23.Rhf1 with complicated play after 23...a5 or 23...Bd6
24.g4 a5. Instead, 23...Na3+? is not a good idea as after 24.Ka1! (24.bxa3 Rc3! leads
to complications of the kind Black is looking for) 24...Nxc2+ 25.Kb1 White is clearly better as 25...Na3+?? blunders a piece to the simple 26.bxa3 Rc3 27.Qd2 bxa3+ 28.Ka1.
23...a5 24.Rhe1 a4 25.Re4 Qc5 26.Qe2
The game has reached its climax. Black needs to continue his attack, and he has to be decisive about it! Probably, Warmerdam could not calculate the consequences of a piece sacrifice and he opted for a 'useful move':
26...Bf8?
This proves to be a crucial loss of time as Black's attack loses its momentum. A) Objectively strongest was 26...Nxb2! with a dynamic balance. The probable main line would be 27.Kxb2 Qc3+ 28.Kb1 b3! (28...a3? is wrong as Black does not have a good follow-up after 29.Nd3) 29.cxb3 Ba3! 30.Nd3. analysis diagram It is easy to understand that Max did not sacrifice his knight on b2 to enter this position. Black is a full piece down, and he doesn't have an immediate hit. However, the attack continues (White's Nf5 is a bit out of play) and Black has sufficient compensation to keep the balance: 30...axb3 (if 30...Rxd5, White has some advantage after 31.Rxa4! Qxd3+ 32.Qxd3 Rxd3 33.Re1;
30...Rdc7 does not work the way Black wants it after 31.Rc4! Rxc4 32.bxc4 Qxc4
33.d6!) 31.axb3 Rb7 (31...Qxb3+ transposes to the text after 32.Nb2 Rb7 33.Rd2
Qc3) 32.Nb2 Rxb3 33.Rd2. Now Black needs to be clever! 33...Rb7! and here the most testing move for Black is 34.Ra4!. (34.Rc2 leads to a draw after 34...Qxc2+
35.Qxc2 Rxc2 36.Kxc2 Rxb2+ 37.Kd3, and after 34.Ne3 Black gets sufficient
compensation with 34...Qc1+ 35.Ka2 Bc5! - 35...Rc3? fails to 36.Ned1!) analysis diagram It looks as if Black's attack is coming to its end... however, he has resources to keep the fire burning: 34...Qc1+! 35.Ka2 Rc3!. The bishop on a3 cannot be taken because of ...Qa1# at the end, while 36... Rcb3 is a deadly threat. Now White has to be careful! 36.Nd6! and we get a balanced position: 36...Bxd6 37.Qa6 Ra3+! 38.Rxa3 Bxa3 39.Qxa3 Ra7 (39...Qxd2 leads to a draw by perpetual check: 40.Qf8+ Ka7
41.Qa3+) 40.Qxa7+ Kxa7 41.Rd1 and his strong passed pawn and good R+N
coordination ensure White equality here; B) 26...Rb7 can lead to some spectacular lines, which was one of the reasons why I decided to include this game: 27.Nd3. Now, the principled move (in the spirit of the position) is to sactifice a knight to open routes to White's king: 27...Na3+ (if
27...Qb5, White is better after 28.d6!). The next couple of moves are more or less
forced: 28.bxa3 bxa3+ 29.Kc1 Qc3. analysis diagram Black has a strong threat in 30...Qa1+ followed by 31... Rxc2+. Not being able to stop this, White would do better to collect some more material: 30.Nxe7!. Black has to continue his plan: 30...Qa1+ 31.Kd2 Rxc2+ 32.Kxc2 Qxa2+ 33.Kc3. There is no checkmate but Black collects White's queen: 33...Rb3+ 34.Kc4 Rb2+ 35.Kc5 Rxe2. analysis diagram Black's king is now a target and we get nice mating net ideas. 36.Rb4+ Kc7 (36...Ka8? makes White's job really easy: 37.Rxa4+ - or 37.Nc6 - 37...Kb7 38.Kd6)
37.d6+ and the position (as well as the solution) is study-like: 37...Kd7.
analysis diagram B1) The logical continuation 38.Kb6 (preparing 39.Nc5+) leads to equality after
38...Rd2! (38...Rc2 should lose to 39.Ka5!) 39.Nc5+ Ke8 40.Rxd2 Qxd2 41.Nc6
Qxd6 42.Rxa4 and after 42...Qd2 43.Rxa3 Qb2+ 44.Rb3 Qxh2 we get an interesting position with an engine evaluation of around zero; B2) 38.Kb5 should win as after 38...Rd2 (38...Rc2 39.Ka5) 39.Nc5+ Ke8 40.Rxd2 Qxd2 (compared to the 38.Kb6 line), the Rb4 is defended so White can keep his d- pawn by playing 41.Nf5; B3) 38.Rb7+ Ke6. analysis diagram Test yourself! White to play and win! Find the beautiful idea! 39.d7! Qc2+ 40.Kb6 Kxe7 (40...Qxd1 makes White's job easy, losing to the prosaic 41.d8=Q). analysis diagram Now comes the point behind the idea that started with 38.Rb7+: 41.Rb8! and Black is forced to resign 41...Kxd7 (or 41...Qb3+ 42.Ka7 Qxb8+ 43.Kxb8 Kxd7 44.Nf4+ or 43...Kd8 44.Nc5) 42.Nc5+ Ke7 43.Rd7#.
27.d6!
This thematic idea disrupts Black's attacking plans.
27...Qc6
The pawn cannot be taken as 27...Bxd6 loses to 28.Nxd6 Nxd6 29.Nd3 Qc6
30.Rxb4+; or 27...Nxd6 28.Nxd6 Rxd6 (28...Bxd6 29.Nd3 Qb6 30.Nxb4) 29.Nd3
Qa5 30.Rxb4+. White now has a clear advantage, but the position remains complicated and mistakes are easy to make. For quite some time White plays it right.
28.Rh4 Nxd6 29.Rxb4+ Nb7 30.Rc4! Qxc4 31.Rxd7 Qc6 32.Rd3 Qe6 33.g4 h5
34.h3 hxg4 35.hxg4 a3 36.b3 Bb4
Objectively, Black does not have enough for his pawn deficit, however he does have practical chances.
37.Ne3
Better was 37.c4! followed by Rd5.
37...e4 38.Nc4
Better was 38.Rd5.
38...f5?
Black does not take his chance!
38...Nd6! led to equality after 39.Re3 (39.Nxd6?? blunders into a mate: 39...exd3
40.Qxe6 dxc2+ 41.Ka1 Bc3#) 39...Nxc4 (39...Nb5 is a good alternative) 40.bxc4
Rxc4.
39.Rd4
Better was 39.c3.
39...Qf6 40.Qh2+
40...Ka8?
The final mistake in this exciting game. 40...f4! would have kept Black in the game, e.g. 41.c3! Rh8 (41...Bxc3? is wrong due to 42.Rxe4+-) 42.Qc2 Bc5 43.Rxe4 f3 with compensation. Now White's knight enters the fray with devastating force.
41.Ne5! Rc5 42.Nd7! Qd8 43.Ne2 1-0
Chapter 2 The Maroczy Bind The Maroczy Bind is one of the oldest Sicilian set-ups. I have selected six games for this chapter to explain what I consider to be the important aspects (strategic points) of this complex opening. Let's start with the 'Classical Maroczy Bind', examining positions that are favourable for Black and those that are favourable for White. In the first diagram we have a position Black is happy to achieve. The first important aspect is that Black's knight is safely placed on the c5-outpost; it will take White quite some time to conveniently hit it with b3-b4. Black's pieces are well coordinated and ready to take advantage of the mobile pawn structure, creating strong counterplay by pushing ...f5. Black can easily take over the initiative in such a position. In the second diagram we have a position White is happy to get. Black's knight is stuck on e6, White controls the c5-square (making it very difficult for Black to regroup), White has a space advantage and easy play while Black struggles to create counterplay. Our first two games illustrate the above-mentioned aspects very well. A straight attack for White Game 8 Bent Larsen Tigran Petrosian Santa Monica 1966
1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.d4 cxd4 4.Nxd4 g6 5.Be3 Bg7 6.c4 Nf6 7.Nc3 Ng4 8.Qxg4
Nxd4 9.Qd1 Ne6 10.Qd2 d6 11.Be2 Bd7 12.O-O O-O
13.Rad1
By developing the Ra1 to d1, White aims for a strategy combining a kingside attack with space dominance. Just like in the next game, Keres-Petrosian, the question whether Black is able to secure the c5-outpost for his knight plays a very important role here! An immediate kingside attacking idea has also been tried at top level: 13.f4 Bc6
14.f5 (on 14.Bf3 Black can choose: 14...Nc5 (14...Qa5 is a reasonable alternative)
and now White can opt for a pawn sacrifice with 15.b4!? Bxc3 16.Qxc3 Nxe4 with sharp play) 14...Nc5 15.Bf3. Black has to secure his knight's outpost: 15...a5! 16.Bh6 (Black's king is safe here - White will not get anything close to a Dragon attack) 16...Qb6 17.Bxg7 Kxg7
18.Kh1 f6 and Black had a good position and went on to win in Spassky-Savon,
Moscow 1973. White can certainly consider the immediate 13.b4 a5 14.a3, to control c5, when Black has no dynamic follow-up. For 13.Rac1 see the next game, Keres-Petrosian.
13...Bc6
Petrosian probably did not play 13...a5 because he was worried about White starting an attack with 14.f4 Bc6 15.Bf3 Nc5 analysis diagram
16.e5! Bxf3 17.Rxf3 b6 and now White can afford the violent 18.f5!. The position
opens up and White has a strong attack: 18...Bxe5 (also 18...dxe5 19.Qe1 Qe8
20.Nd5 will not end well for Black) 19.Bd4.
14.Nd5
An easy way for White to get a clear advantage here is to immediately deprive Black from the c5-outpost by playing 14.b4!. Black is doomed to passive defence; his knight on e6 is clumsy here. Trying to conquer c5 for his knight with 14...a5? leads to a disaster after the simple 15.b5 Bd7 16.Na4 and in a higher sense White has a winning advantage. It is interesting that two years prior, Bent Larsen played the same position as Black (!!), getting a good game and winning in the end. His opponent did not go for 14.b4!; it would be interesting to know why, playing White two years later, Bent did not go for 14.b4! here and also why Petrosian did not copy Larsen's play - for psychological reasons?
14...Re8
In the mentioned game, Larsen immediately secured the c5-outpost here with
14...Nc5! 15.f3 a5.
Black's situation improved further as White now made the wrong trade: 16.Bd4? when Larsen showed an instructive strategic plan: 16...Bxd4+ 17.Qxd4 e5!. Though the engines give zeros, in human play Black has the better chances in my opinion. White's Be2, locked up by its own pawns, is inferior to Black's excellently placed knight: 18.Qd2
18...Ne6 (Black could have opted for a good strategic trade with 18...Bxd5 with an
excellent position after 19.Qxd5 Ra6) 19.Ne3 Qb6. Black had a pleasant position and went on to win in Porat-Larsen, Amsterdam 1964. In our game, White starts immediate kingside action.
15.f4
White would have obtained a clear advantage with 15.b4!. Black's knight is deprived of the square c5 while the f5 pawn push is coming, with an attack.
15...Nc7?
This passive idea certainly does not help Black. Most likely Petrosian rejected 15...Nc5 because he did not like 16.e5, but still... for better or worse, this was the decision Black had to take here. It's good to know that after 16.Bf3 Black has an equalizing tactical motif that is useful to remember:
16...Nxe4! 17.Bxe4 e6=.
16.f5! Na6
Black is busy with his knight pirouette, achieving nothing. White probably felt the time was right to move to the execution phase and went for the direct:
17.Bg4
Simple 17.b4! was (in a higher sense) leading to a winning advantage. Black does not have the way to activate his knight. In reality White is a piece up on the kingside and will crush Black in attack!
17...Nc5!
Now Black is (very much) back in the game.
18.fxg6 hxg6 19.Qf2
Probably stronger was 19.Bxc5 dxc5 20.Qf4 Rf8 analysis diagram
21.e5! (note that the queen win 21.Nf6+ exf6 22.Rxd8 Raxd8 only improves Black's
position) 21...Bxd5 22.cxd5 Qb6. We have a position with opposite-coloured bishops, but White is the attacking side: 23.d6! exd6 24.e6! f5 25.e7 Rfe8 and White has an advantage, though the position is complicated. A logical run of play can be
26.Bf3! Bd4+! (26...Rxe7? 27.Bd5+ Kf8 28.Qg5 leads to a win for White) 27.Kh1
Rxe7 28.Qh6 Rh7! 29.Qxg6+ Kh8 30.Qxf5.
19...Rf8
20.Qh4 was possible here, but White makes a principled pawn sacrifice to continue
the attack:
20.e5!? Bxe5 21.Qh4 Bxd5 22.Rxd5
An interesting position. Many zeros for the computer engine... less easy for a human player!
22...Ne6
22...e6 is not an easy decision; after 23.Qxd8 Rfxd8 24.Rxe5 dxe5 25.Bxc5
analysis diagram to a human (at least to me) White's chances look better, however the engine holds this with active rook play: 25...Rac8!. After 22...Bf6 at first glance it looks like Black will be mated after 23.Rxf6 exf6
24.Bd4,
analysis diagram however Black has the defensive resource 24...Re8!! 25.Bxf6 Re1+ 26.Qxe1 (26.Kf2?? blunders into the prosaic 26...Ne4+) 26...Qxf6 with equality. The engine-type move 22...f5 (not likely to be played by a human) also appears to lead to equality: 23.Qg5 Bg7 24.Qxg6. analysis diagram Here Black needs to find 24...Rf6! (White has a winning attack in the event of
24...fxg4? 25.Rxf8+ Qxf8 26.Rf5 Qe8 27.Qxg4) 25.Qh5 e6! and after 26.Bxf5 (we
get a draw by perpetual check after 26.Bf3 exd5! 27.Bxd5+ Ne6 analysis diagram
28.g4! fxg4 29.Bxe6+ Rxe6 30.Qf7+ Kh8 31.Qh5+ Kg8 32.Qf7+ Kh8 and White
can play for a win but the position remains equal after 33.Qxe6 Qe8) 26...exd5
27.Qh7+ Kf8.
analysis diagram The position is very sharp. The zeroes evaluation by the engines does not mean much in human play here: 28.Bd4 Qe7! 29.cxd5 Qf7 30.b4, and the zeroes blinking on my computer tell me this position is 'dynamically balanced'.
23.Rf3
Now Black needs to be careful!
23...Bf6?
This runs into a nice finish. Black's king needed an escape square and it could have been created by 23...f5!
24.Rh3 Ng7!.
analysis diagram Now White has nothing better than to force a draw by perpetual check with 25.Qh7+ Kf7 26.Rh6 fxg4 27.Qxg6+ Kg8 28.Qh7+.
24.Qh6 Bg7
Bent Larsen must have felt great executing his next move!
25.Qxg6!!
Not a difficult sacrifice, but still a nice picture!
25...Nf4 26.Rxf4 fxg6 27.Be6+ Rf7 28.Rxf7 Kh8
29.Rg5
White has all the time in the world to give checkmate as Black's pieces are completely cut off and unable to help his poor monarch.
29...b5 30.Rg3 1-0
The importance of the c5-square Game 9 Paul Keres Tigran Petrosian Bled/Zagreb/Belgrade ct 1959
1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.d4 cxd4 4.Nxd4 g6 5.c4 Bg7 6.Be3 Nf6 7.Nc3 Ng4 8.Qxg4
Nxd4 9.Qd1 Ne6 10.Qd2 d6 11.Be2 Bd7 12.O-O O-O In my opinion, White has a clear advantage here if Black does not manage to secure c5-outpost for his knight. Without the knight on c5, Black is unable to create counterplay in these positions.
13.Rac1
White has a different set-up here starting with 13.Rad1 - see the previous game Larsen-Petrosian.
13...Bc6
An important moment!
14.Rfd1
This logical rook development is actually a mistake! Black now secures the c5- outpost for his knight and gets the type of position he was aiming for. Precise was 14.b4! with a clear advantage - more space, different plans. Black has no counterplay and is doomed to passivity: A) Fighting for the c5-square with 14...a5? leads to a disaster after 15.b5 Bd7
16.Na4. Black cannot coordinate his pieces at all, and White has a winning
advantage. For the reader to get an idea how bad Black's situation is, I will give the following line: 16.Rfd1 b6 17.Na4 Nc5 18.Nxc5 bxc5 19.a4. White has a passed pawn and more space and obviously should have an advantage here. The question is, how much of an advantage do you think Stockfish gives? The answer is almost plus three!; B) The pawn grab 14...Bxc3? 15.Qxc3 Bxe4 leads to suicide after 16.Bh6 Re8
17.Bg4 f5 18.Rfe1 and Black soon gets mated;
C) Probably Black has to opt for something like 14...b6. White has an easy advantage here and many good ways to continue; for example, 15.Nd5 or 15.h4.
14...Nc5 15.f3
Now Black secures his Nc5 outpost!
15...a5!
Suddenly Black has achieved his initial objective and he has a clear plan: b-pawn to b6, rook moves to d7 via a7, and then it will be time to push the kingside pawns: ...e6 followed by ...f5, with good play. White will be just playing around achieving nothing while Black will execute this plan. Checking with a computer engine may give you a wrong impression here. The engines are very happy with White's position, but in human play matters are not clear. Black wants to (and ultimately will) execute the mentioned plan, so what is White supposed to do here? Well, he has a couple of ideas to explore: a) prepare a3, followed by b4 and kick the Nc5 out; b) improve the Be2 by playing Bf1, g3 and Bh3; c) consider bold action pushing the g-pawn (g4).
16.b3 Qb6
Immediately starting with 16...b6 was the alternative.
17.Nb5
17.Nd5 was an alternative as after 17...Bxd5 (if Black plays 17...Qd8, White can
consider the above-mentioned plans) 18.cxd5 Qb4 the queens will be swapped and White will have an advantage in ending... the only question is how big. Other options are 17.Kh1 Qb4 18.Nd5 Bxd5 19.cxd5 Rfc8 or 17.Kf1.
17...Rfc8 18.Bf1
Black now decides to start the mentioned regrouping plan:
18...Qd8! 19.Qf2
19.g3 deserved attention.
19...Qe8 20.Nc3 b6 21.Rc2 Qf8 22.Qd2 Bd7 23.Nd5 Rab8 24.Bg5
The bold 24.g4!? was an option.
24...Re8 25.Re1
Let's suppose White wants to call it a day with 25.Nc7 Red8 26.Nd5 - well, Black can keep playing on with 26...f6 27.Be3 e6 28.Nf4 Bc6.
25...Rb7 26.Qf2 Bc6 27.Qh4
Black now executes the last phase of his regrouping plan:
27...f6! 28.Be3 e6! 29.Nc3
In the past 15 moves, Black has improved his position a lot while White's pieces are still more or less in the same positions(!). Black is ready for the ...f5 break, taking over the initiative. Note the importance of the stable Nc5 in all this!
29...Rd7
The immediate 29...f5 was certainly possible since Black pieces are well coordinated, e.g. 30.exf5 exf5 or 30...gxf5.
30.Bd4
Petrosian judges that the moment for the pawn break has come:
30...f5! 31.exf5 gxf5 32.Rd2
Black is happy to trade the dark-squared bishops.
32...Bxd4+ 33.Rxd4 Rg7 34.Kh1 Rg6 35.Rd2
Black has attacking potential here, his king is safer, the pawn on d6 is an 'academic weakness' and White's Bf1 is badly placed (dominated by the Nc5).
35...Rd8
Black could have played more directly with 35...Qg7 and ...e5 to follow.
36.Red1 Rd7 37.Qf2 Qd8 38.Qe3
After quite a lot of preparatory moves, Black decides to push his e-pawn.
38...e5
39...f4 looks unpleasant, so White decides to act:
39.f4
How should Black react? Uncharacteristically, Petrosian committed a serious strategic blunder:
39...e4?
Black kills his own bishop and kills his own attack. Petrosian must have overestimated the ...Nd3 jump ideas. Black had to increase the tension with 39...Qh4! when White's situation is not easy as after 40.Qf2 (40.fxe5 allows a strong attack: 40...Rh6 41.Qg1 dxe5 42.Rxd7 Nxd7; Black's king is safe, he has dangerous mobile pawns, the Bc6 is well placed while the Bf1 is doomed to passivity, e.g. 43.Nd5 f4 with ...Nc5, ...Rg6 to follow....Black is clearly better) Black can choose between grabbing a pawn and playing for the initiative with 40...Qh5. After 40...Qxf4 41.Qxf4 exf4 Black may have lousy pawns but one of them is extra. White faces an uphill struggle for a draw.
40.Ne2
As a result of Black's mistake, the situation has changed drastically. Black's d6- weakness is no longer 'academic' - now it is simply a weak pawn (just like f5)! White had to immediately target Black's pawn weaknesses with 40.Nb5! when he has a large advantage. The transaction 40...Bxb5 41.cxb5 does not help Black as the 'stupid' Bf1 goes to c4 and suddenly becomes a monster bishop, while the 'stable' Nc5 will have to leave its post as White will play a3 followed by b4.
40...Rdg7 41.Nd4 Bd7
Now finally White decides to chase away the Nc5 from its post:
42.a3 Qa8 43.Kg1
43.Nb5 led to White's advantage.
43...h5 44.Rb1 h4 45.Rbb2 Rg4 46.Rf2
White is ready to push 47.b4 with a clear advantage. Black needs a strong tactical resource here!
46...Qd8! 47.b4 Rg3!
To come up with this sacrifice, Petrosian needed to envision the pretty mating net that we are about to see. Keres takes a principled decision, accepting the sacrifice.
48.hxg3
White had an alternative in 48.Qe1 axb4 49.axb4 Nd3 50.Bxd3 Rxd3 51.Rfd2 with unclear play.
48...hxg3
The critical moment!
49.Rfd2?
In order to save His Majesty, White needed to return the material:
49.Rf3! Qh4 and now:
A) 50.Rxg3 Rxg3 51.Qe1 Na4. analysis diagram The position is equal but White needs a precise tactical defence: 52.Re2! Qxf4
53.Nxf5! Bxf5 54.Rf2! Qh4! (54...Qe3 leads to a drawish endgame: 55.Qxe3 Rxe3
56.Rxf5=)
analysis diagram White seems to have been tricked. 55.Rxf5?? loses the queen to 55...Rxg2 so Black is a piece up. But White saves the game using Black's weak king and hanging pieces: 55.Qd1! Qf6 (55...Nc3 keeps an extra piece but 56.Qxd6 holds). Now White gets his material back with equality by 56.Qxa4 or 56.Qd5+. B) The less human 50.Be2 also leads to approximate equality: 50...exf3 (the fancy
50...Qh2+ 51.Kf1 exf3 52.Nxf3 Ne4 does not create a real threat: White can calmly
take 53.bxa5! and Black struggles to find a good move as 53...bxa5?? blunders into the simple 54.Rb8+ Kh7 55.Nxh2 gxh2 56.Qh3+) 51.Nxf3 analysis diagram
51...Qh8! (Black wants to play 52...Rh7) 52.Qd4! Ne6 53.Qf6 Rh7 54.Qxh8+ Kxh8.
Now we get a few more trades, 55.Rd2 Nxf4 56.Bf1 Bc6 57.Rxd6 Bxf3 58.gxf3, leading to a probable draw. The 'computer move' 49.Be2 transposes after 49...Qh4 50.Rf3.
49...Qh4 50.Be2
White can no longer be saved as 50.Nf3 loses to 50...exf3 51.gxf3. analysis diagram Black is now only an exchange down while his mating attack continues... still, precision is needed: 51...Rh7! 52.Bg2 Re7! 53.Qd4 Re1+ 54.Bf1 and now the knight needs to join the party: 54...Ne6! 55.Qd5 (or 55.Qxd6 Nxf4). analysis diagram It would be wrong to think that any move wins, as only one move wins! 55...Be8
56.bxa5 Kg7! with 57...Nxf4 and the mating net is closed (56...Bf7? is wrong due to
the simple 57.Qxd6 and if 57...Nxf4 there will be 58.Qd8+).
50...Rh7 51.Kf1
And this instructive game concluded elegantly:
51...Qxf4+!! 0-1
The third game shows a strategically interesting plan of Bent Larsen's which is hardly used nowadays. It doesn't really work provided White reacts well. Larsen's dark-square domination Game 10 Anatoly Karpov 2710 Bent Larsen 2565 Brussels 1987
1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.d4 cxd4 4.Nxd4 g6 5.c4 Bg7 6.Be3 Nf6 7.Nc3 Ng4 8.Qxg4
Nxd4 9.Qd1 Ne6 In the 1980s, Larsen developed an interesting dark-square domination concept for Black here: keeping the king in the centre, starting with the early queen sortie to a5 and being ready to place his queen in the middle of the board e5-square. The concept had practical success against the world's very best players. However, if White knows what to aim for, Black can get into serious trouble. I will give four examples of top players (Karpov, Kramnik, Anand and Short) reacting as White. Anand was the only one whogot it right! Let's see and try to draw some conclusions.
10.Qd2
A game of Nigel Short playing White (vs Larsen) went 10.Rc1 Qa5 11.Be2 b6 12.0-
0 Bb7.
Already a critical position! What can be Black's problem here? Answer: his exposed queen. White should take action and harass the queen, at the price of a pawn if needed! One 'rule' is that a queen trade is okay for Black in this line. A) Instead of taking immediate action, White played a standard constructive move:
13.f3, and now Larsen went for his dark-square domination plan: 13...g5! 14.a3 (the
pawn sacrifice 14.Nd5 Bxb2 is not clear at all here) 14...Qe5. Due to Black's control of the dark squares, his queen is safe in the middle of the board. 15.Qd2. Black has already decided to keep his king in the centre and takes more space on the kingside: 15...h5! 16.Rfd1 d6. Not being able to disturb Black's queen, White takes the correct decision to push on the queenside: 17.b4 h4 18.Nd5 Kf8 19.Bf1 (probably best was to be consistent and continue 19.a4!) 19...Bc6. Black is controlling a lot of (dark) central squares, however now it's not easy to find a clever follow-up. It would be nice to make a couple of good trades - which is exactly what Nigel Short assists his opponent in doing: 20.Qd3 (the correct decision was 20.Qf2, preparing Rd2 followed by a4, and here we see another drawback of Black's concept: he has difficulty improving his position while White has a plan;
20.b5!? Bb7 21.a4 also deserves consideration) 20...Nf4. Now White makes the
wrong trades: 21.Nxf4? (it was not too late to change his mind and retreat with
21.Qd2) 21...gxf4. White now helps Black with another trade: 22.Bd4?! (22.Bf2)
22...Qxd4+ 23.Qxd4 Bxd4+ 24.Rxd4 Rh5.
Capablanca's rule was: 'Do not have pawns on the squares of your bishop' - have a look at White's bishop here! Black went on to win this ending in Short-Larsen, Brussels 1987; B) Much more to the point was 13.a3!. White wants to play 14.b4, embarrassing Black's queen, and Black is already in a rather unpleasant situation. B1) If 13...h5 (Black wants to play 14...g5, securing his queen on e5, but he won't get the time) 14.b4! Qxa3 15.Nd5 White has considerably more than just compensation - compare this to Anand-Ljubojevic later in the comments; B2) If 13...g5, trying to follow the same strategy Larsen did in the game, White has a pleasant choice between a temporary pawn sacrifice and using the fact that his f- pawn is still on f2 and play 14.Bg4. After 14.Nd5! Bxb2 Black's queen is badly placed: 15.Bd2 Qc5 16.Rc2 Be5 17.Bb4 and Black is in bad shape; B3) Whether he likes it or not, probably Black has to accept White's pawn sacrifice and part with his dark-squared bishop: 13...Bxc3 14.Rxc3 Bxe4 15.Re1. Black's queen is still exposed and he still has to castle, while White's pieces coordinate excellently... White has plenty of compensation here.
10...Qa5 11.Rc1 b6
This game was played in the same tournament as Short-Larsen, but this one was played first (played in the first round of the tournament). Karpov also takes a slow approach.
12.Be2
Vishy Anand, playing the same position ten years later (in a rapid game) did much better: 12.Bd3 Bb7 13.O-O. Ljubo knew Larsen's games and copied his plan: 13...g5. Anand takes the right approach: harass Black's queen and don't care if this involves a pawn sac: 14.a3! h5 15.b4!. Ljubo says: 'if I have to suffer, better to do so with a pawn up'. 15...Qxa3 (15...Qe5 was an option; however after 16.Nd5 White has a considerably better version of Short-Larsen; he will follow up with 17.a4 and open up the queenside, with a clear advantage. The position is similar to the game where White's a-pawn is still on the board) 16.Nd5 Qb2 17.Rc2 Qe5. Black has grabbed a pawn and his queen is, for the time being anyhow, safe in the centre. Black's problem? His queenside will collapse. 18.Ra2 h4 19.h3. Black understands that he won't be able to defend his queenside, so he hopes to create some threats to White's king: 19...Rg8 (if 19...Bxd5? 20.exd5 Nf4 21.Bxb6 Black starts losing material on the queenside without any threats to show for it) 20.Rd1 Bh8 (Black's threats are easy to stop) 21.Be2! Bc6 22.Bf3 Kf8. This was a rapid game, so even for a player of Anand's stature it's not easy to find the best execution. 23.b5! was White's quickest road to victory here (23.Qc2 was played in the game, White went on to win in Anand-Ljubojevic, Monaco 1997)
23...Bxd5 (23...Bb7 loses to 24.Nxe7) 24.exd5 and White wins on the queenside, e.g.
24...Nc5 25.Bxc5 bxc5 26.d6 Re8 27.Rxa7 etc.
12...Bb7 13.f3
Larsen comes up with his concept of gaining space on the kingside:
13...h5 14.O-O
In a rapid game, Kramnik took a cautious approach (not trying to harass Black's queen but trading the queens instead) and got nothing: 14.b3 h4 analysis diagram
15.Nd5?! (this only equalizes) 15...Qxd2+ 16.Kxd2 with a balanced game, later
drawn in Kramnik-Ljubojevic, Monaco rapid 1994. Larsen continues with his plan:
14...g5 15.Rfd1 d6
Now, similar to Kramnik, Karpov makes a wrong trade!
16.Nd5?
The queen trade helps Black here. Karpov probably overestimated his queenside pawn advance, but it would have had been considerably more efficient with queens on the board. Similar to Anand, White had to go for 16.a3! followed by b4, not being afraid to sacrifice a pawn in the process.
16...Qxd2 17.Rxd2
The position is now balanced. Black places his dark-squared bishop in the middle of the board and puts his kingside pawns on dark squares.
17...Be5 18.b4 Rc8 19.a4 h4 20.Bf1 f6 21.Ra2
White's dark-squared bishop is an important piece for his queenside activity, so it makes sense for Black to trade it.
21...Bd4! 22.Kf2 Kf7 23.a5
We now get trades, Black doing well in the ensuing N vs B positions.
23...Bxd5 24.exd5 Bxe3+ 25.Kxe3 Nf4
Black is happy with his N vs B here.
26.Kd2
White does not get a free hand to target Black's queenside.
26...Rc7! 27.axb6 axb6 28.Ra6
Black decides to play actively:
28...Rhc8
28...Rb8 was also good enough.
29.Rxb6 Nxd5 30.Rb5 Nf4 31.Ra5
Now Black improves his knight, targeting White's c4 weakness:
31...Ng6!
White has to be careful as Black is taking over.
32.c5 Ne5 33.Rc3 dxc5 34.bxc5 Rb8
Black's knight is strong while White's passer is not going anywhere.
35.Bb5 Rd8+ 36.Ke2
36...Nc6
Black decides to call it a day. He has a pleasant position here and could have continued without risk for a few more moves with 36...f5 or 36...e6 followed by ...f5, ...Kf6.
37.Bxc6 Rxc6 38.g3 Rd4=
Now we have a drawn rook ending.
39.Rb5 hxg3 40.hxg3 Rd5 41.g4 Rc7 42.Ke3 e6 43.Rc2 Ke7 44.Rc3 Kf7 45.Rc2
f5 46.gxf5 exf5 47.Kf2 Kg7 1⁄2-1⁄2 White plays a Dragon-type set-up A modern development in the Maroczy Bind (and not surprisingly, one the computer engines love!) is that White assumes the set-up on the kingside that is usually employed against the Dragon. Here White has his pawn on c4 instead of c2, making Black's counterplay more difficult. I have picked three modern games that show the problems Black might be facing. In Navara-Jakovenko we see that the g4-push can be dangerous for Black even when the queens are traded! In the other two games, Berdnarskiy-Vakhidov and Caruana- Carlsen, we see White's attacking potential although in both games White does not take advantage of it. A Dragon-like decision Game 11 David Navara 2707 Dmitrij Jakovenko 2698 Jerusalem 2019

Bg7 9.f3 O-O 10.Qd2 Be6 11.Rc1 Qa5
12.b3
In the early days of this variation, it was considered that White was able to force a great ending here by playing 12.Nd5. A) The ending is indeed bad for Black: 12...Qxd2+? 13.Kxd2. Black is forced to part with his bishop: 13...Bxd5 14.cxd5 Rfc8. White plays it very precisely:
15.Rxc8+ Rxc8.
White has a space advantage plus the bishop pair. He has a large advantage here and in a higher sense a technically won position. In a game by Polugaevsky played more than fifty years ago I found a technically instructive win: 16.g3! (White's bishop will be excellently placed on the h3-c8 diagonal; Black has to be careful not to lose immediately) 16...Rc7 17.Bh3 Nd7 18.Rc1! (good judgement by Polu) 18...Rxc1
19.Kxc1 Nb6 (Black has prevented an immediate loss, but in reality he has only
'postponed' losing the a7-pawn and the game) 20.Kc2 Kf8

B) But then it was discovered that Black had the strong reply 12...Qxa2!, leading to a dynamic balance: 13.Nxe7+ Kh8 14.Bd4. Due to White's uncastled king Black has enough counterplay: 14...Rae8
15.Nd5 (Magnus Carlsen showed an interesting idea for White in an internet game:
15.Qc3!? Nh5 16.Bxg7+ Nxg7 and now White is hoping to catch the black queen:
17.b4 Qa4 18.b5 (well... the queen easily escapes) 18...a5 19.Nd5 Bxd5 20.cxd5
(Black has great counterplay) 20...f5! 21.Ra1 Qb4 22.Qxb4 axb4 23.Bd3 Nh5 with approximate equality in Carlsen-Guseinov, chess.com blitz 2017) 15...Bxd5 16.cxd5 Rc8 17.Be2 Rxc1+ 18.Qxc1. A typical position in which the bishop pair is superior to B+N, however with just B vs N we have an unclear situation: 18...Nd7! 19.Bxg7+ Kxg7 20.Qc3+ Kg8 21.O-O - both sides have something to play for, and a draw was agreed in Polugaevsky- Andersson, Hilversum 1973.
12...Rfc8
Black does not have a threat yet. He needs one more move, 13...a6, in order to threaten 14...b5 and now is the moment for White to take a Dragon-like approach:
13.g4!
Black has nothing better but to go for his regular counterplay plan:
13...a6
After a move like 13...Rab8 White gets a clear advantage with the easy plan 14.h4 h5
15.g5 Nd7

16.Nd5! Qxd2+ (rejecting the ending with 16...Qd8 does not make Black happy after
17.Nf4) 17.Kxd2. The pawn on e7 is hanging, while 18. Nf4 is in the position too:
17...Bxd5 18.cxd5 and the position has resemblance to Polugaevsky-Ostojic given
above. Navara decides to force a queen swap.
14.Na4
White has a good (probably better) alternative in 14.g5 Nd7 15.Nd5 ... analysis diagram ... and again Black has an unpleasant choice between entering into an inferior ending (playing for two results) with 15...Qxd2 or 15...Qd8 16.Nf4 with great attacking prospects for White.
14...Qxd2+ 15.Kxd2 Nd7
White's dilemma here is: how to push the pawns?
16.Rg1
Probably a better way was 16.h4. Black is under unpleasant pressure here: 16...Rc6 (the idea suggested below as an improvement on Jakovenko's play, 16...Rcb8
17.Nb6 Nxb6 18.Bxb6 Bb2, works less well here as White can advance his pawns
more easily: 19.Rc2 Ba3 20.g5 Bc5 21.Bxc5 dxc5 22.Ke3 - White continues pushing on the kingside and has an easy, risk-free advantage; threats on the h-file will play a role!) 17.g5 (17.h5 also looks good) 17...Nc5 18.Nc3. White had an advantage but the game Michalik-Guseinov, Batumi 2019, was drawn later.
16...Rc6
Black had a nice defensive idea here: 16...Rcb8! 17.Nb6 Nxb6 18.Bxb6 ... analysis diagram ... and now the bishop transfer 18...Bb2! 19.Rc2 Ba3 20.f4 Bc5 21.Bxc5 dxc5; Black should survive.
17.Be2 Kh8
18.f4!
White has taken too much space. Black's situation deteriorates quickly.
18...Nc5
18...f5 19.exf5 gxf5 20.g5 would have led to a similar outcome.
19.Nxc5 dxc5 20.Bf3 Rc7 21.Ke2 b5
Space advantage matters. Navara's execution is excellent:
22.e5 Rac8
23.Bd5!
White has simple threat: 24.Bxe6 followed by 25.g5, turning Black's Bg7 into a big pawn. Black has no choice but to allow White to create a passed pawn.
23...Bxd5 24.cxd5
Black has no counterplay. The c5-pawn is soon going to be lost and with it, the game.

13...Bd7
As we will soon see, this move is not accurate here. 13...a4! was better and if White goes for the game idea Black will have an extra tempo. Time for White to go for a Dragon- like attack:
14.g4! a4 15.h4! Qa5 16.h5! Be6
White now faces an important dilemma: should he play for a Dragon-like h-file attack or play for space? He opts for the former:
17.O-O-O
Taking space was stronger here: 17.h6! Bh8 18.Kf2. analysis diagram Black is in a difficult situation as White combines a queenside initiative with a bad black king, e.g. 18...Qb4 (or 18...Rfc8 19.b3! axb3 20.axb3 Qb4. Now is the first time to remind Black of his weak king: 21.g5 Ne8 22.Bxh8 Kxh8 23.Qd4+ Kg8. Now is the time for White to open the b-file and take action on the queenside:
24.Ra4! Rxa4 25.bxa4 and White has a large advantage) 19.Rhb1 Rfc8 20.b3! (Black
has a bad choice here since either decision; to close the b-file or to keep it open, leads to a large advantage for White) 20...a3 21.Rd1 or 20...axb3 21.Rxb3.
17...Rfc8 18.hxg6 fxg6 19.g5
White continues with his attacking plan. How should Black react here?
19...Ne8?
The wrong decision.
19...Nh5 was correct, with unclear play as in the event of 20.Kb1? Black simply
collects White's g5-pawn: 20...Bxd4 21.Qxd4 Qxg5! and White has no compensation for it. White now takes two 'non-principled' decisions. First he helps Black to develop:
20.Bxg7?!
White decided to play for the attack, so a logical continuation was 20.Kb1 as now the pawn grab 20...Bxd4 21.Qxd4 Qxg5? is a bad decision since it loses to the
22.Rxh7! blow.
20...Nxg7
And now White goes for a queen trade, which is contrary to his decision to play for an attack.
21.Nd5
21.Kb1 would have been the principled decision here. White does not need to worry
about his c4-pawn as after 21...Bxc4? 22.Bxc4+ Rxc4 he gets an annihilating attack: analysis diagram
23.Qd3 Rac8 24.Nd5 Qd8 25.f4 and White's attack decides (White's attack does
indeed look great, but how great? Well... in Stockfish language White is on plus five here!)
21...Bxd5 22.Qxd5+ Qxd5 23.Rxd5 Ne6
White has spoilt a promising attacking position and turned it into a somewhat worse ending. Black's knight is superior to White's bishop here, while the weakness of the g5-pawn is another worry. From the middlegame perspective, the rest of the game is of little interest to us. I will give just a few comments.
24.Kd2 Rc5 25.Rg1 Ra6
25...Nf4 26.Rxc5 dxc5 looked promising for black.
26.Rg4
26.e5!?, trying to open up the position for the Be2, was worth considering here.
26...Nc7 27.Rxc5 dxc5 28.Kc3 e5 29.f4 exf4 30.Rxf4 Re6
30...Ne6 31.Rg4 Ra8 was more precise.
31.Bd1?
The decisive mistake.
31.Bg4! would have kept White in the game as after 31...Re5 32.Bc8! he has
adequate counterplay.
31...Re5 32.Bxa4 Ne6 33.Rg4 Nxg5

Caruana does not want to allow 11...a4 followed by 12...Qa5 and has an instructive plan!

Black is hitting on the c4-pawn and seems to have enough counterplay, but White has a nice idea.
13.Rc1 Nd7 14.Be2 Nb6
15.Nb5! a3
In reply to 15...Rc8, White plays 16.Na3 and has a large advantage - he has more space and it is easy to improve his position. Black has no real counterplay. Now Fabiano switches to the other side!
16.Nd4 Bd7
A good time for White to start a Dragon-like attack!
17.h4! h5 18.g4! hxg4
Black has to hit White's knight, and it would have been better to start with it here:
18...e5 19.Nb3 (19.Nf5?! looks flashy but there is no mate after 19...gxf5 20.gxf5
Kh7) and now 19...hxg4 when White has two good options. Your computer engine will like both: the typical Dragon idea 20.h5 and the 'conservative' 20.fxg4, transposing to the game.
19.fxg4 e5
White has an annihilating attack. Black's Nb6 is hanging, limiting any counterplay, and it is actually incredible that Magnus escapes here!

Chapter 3 The Hedgehog Hedgehog-type positions can arise from different openings, but predominantly from the English Opening and the Sicilian Defence. This middlegame book is based on
1.e4 systems, so I will deal with Hedgehog-type positions arising from the Sicilian.
Hedgehog position usually arise from either of two well-known Sicilian Variations: the Taimanov and the Kan. The Hedgehog is a complex concept and things can easily go wrong for either side. I have selected eight sample games that show what to my mind are the pros & cons of these positions. My analysis of these games should improve the reader's understanding of the topic (and of the Hedgehog in practical play!). After reading this book, the reader will understand that in my personal opinion, Hedgehog positions arising from the Kan Variation are considerably more dangerous for Black. That said, many great players, including Anatoly Karpov, have opted (as White) to face the Hedgehog set-up in the Taimanov throughout their careers. In Hedgehog positions arising from the Taimanov Variation, I do not like White's knight on the a3-square - it definitely needs to be improved. Diagrams 1 and 2 show White taking action with a Scheveningen-type pawn storm while his knight is still stranded on a3. The Scheveningen pawn storm White has just pushed g4, believing that the Scheveningen-type pawn storm will work even with his knight still on a3. My Stockfish evaluates this diagrammed position as around zero... so it might work - certainly in practical play. However, this concept is rather risky for White as he may simply be 'missing a piece' at some stage. Similar to the first diagram, White is rolling his kingside pawns, not caring about the stranded knight on a3. Here, however, Black has just pushed ...g5 (which is usually an excellent reaction for Black in similar situations - try to remember it!), and we will get tactical play, White will be 'missing a piece' and Black has a great position in this second diagram. The first game I have selected features a somewhat different position, but shows well the trouble White can face when he has stranded knight on a3. The passive knight on a3 Game 14 AR Salem Saleh 2690 Nodirbek Abdusattorov 2661 Sharjah 2022
1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 e6 3.d4 cxd4 4.Nxd4 Nc6
Our Sicilian Hedgehog exploration starts with the Paulsen Variation. In this case, White wants to avoid the Paulsen by opting for a Hedgehog set-up. In my opinion, this Taimanov Hedgehog type is less dangerous for Black than the Hedgehog coming from the Kan Variation, and therefore all other examples in this chapter will arise from the Kan. The main disadvantage of this Taimanov-type Hedgehog is that White's knight lands on a3 and needs time to be brought back into play.
5.Nb5 d6 6.c4 Nf6 7.N1c3 a6 8.Na3
I think the Kan Hedgehog, where White's knight is on the d4-square, is much more dangerous for Black. That said, 12th World Champion Anatoly Karpov favoured this line as White throughout his career, so White's set-up definitely has venom. However, in quite a number of games White lost in this variation, he neglected to bring his Na3 back into play. This recent game is a great example!
8...Be7
For younger readers, it may be interesting to know that in one of the most famous games in this variation Black opted for a gambit: 8...d5?! 9.cxd5 exd5 10.exd5 Nb4
11.Be2 Bc5.
We clearly see the influence of the computer engine on chess preparation as the famous 16th game Karpov-Kasparov from the World Championship Match, Moscow 1985, continued 12.O-O (both teams of seconds who were helping the actors missed that White has a simple solution in 12.Be3! Bxe3 13.Qa4+ Nd7 14.Qxb4 Bc5
15.Qe4+, demonstrated by Karpov a couple of months later in Karpov-Van der Wiel,
Brussels 1986. Interestingly, Van der Wiel managed to hold a draw, but the variation was closed after this) 12...O-O 13.Bf3 Bf5 14.Bg5 Re8 15.Qd2 b5. After a tense fight Kasparov won brilliantly, and I strongly recommend the reader to analyse that game.
9.Be2 O-O 10.O-O b6 11.Be3 Bb7
In some opening manuals you will find 11...Ne5 given as the most precise for Black so as after 12.Qb3 to be able to play 12...Ned7. This set-up with Nf6 & Nd7 is very flexible and was played by quite a number of top players. For many years I also thought that 11...Ne5 was the most precise; however, recent developments (this Abdusattorov game included) shed new light on this.
12.Qb3
12...Nd7
A) In his first outing vs Karpov in this line, Kasparov went for a novelty that worked out badly, but actually the idea is much better than its reputation: 12...Na5!?. Garry's idea found no followers due to the game outcome, but it looks playable for Black: 13.Qxb6 Nxe4 14.Nxe4 Bxe4 15.Qxd8 Bxd8 16.Rad1. And here Black can improve on Kasparov's play with 16...Bf6! (in the game Black probably miscalculated something; after 16...d5? 17.f3 Bf5 18.cxd5 exd5 19.Rxd5 Be6 20.Rd6 Bxa2 21.Rxa6 White was a sound pawn up and soon won in Karpov- Kasparov, Moscow 1984) 17.b3 (17.Bd4 Be7 is about equal) 17...Nc6 18.f3 (White can sacrifice an exchange with 18.Rxd6 Be7 19.c5 Bxd6 20.cxd6 when he has compensation but not more) and now comes the important move 18...Bb2! 19.Nb1 Bxb1 20.Rxb1 (only Black can be better in case of 20.Rxd6 Bxa2 21.Rxc6 Rfb8)
20...Ba3 21.f4 a5. White's queenside majority cannot advance, Black has a stable
position and can play ...Bc5 at any time he chooses, trading the bishops. The position is about equal; B) If Black is willing to adopt the above-mentioned set-up with Nd7/Nf6, he can still reach it by playing 12...Ne5 (this possibility was completely omitted by old theory!) as after 13.Bxb6 (13.f3 Ned7 and we have the standard set-up) 13...Qd7 Black has great compensation for the sacrificed pawn - White's pieces are poorly coordinated here; C) Black also has interesting option in a move that has not been played yet at the time of writing, so strange enough it would be a novelty: 12...Rb8 analysis diagram followed by ...Ba8, with complicated play. The pawn grab is risky and probably not advisable: 13.Bxb6 (13.Qxb6 is not even a pawn grab; after 13...Qxb6 14.Bxb6 Ba8 White has to give his pawn back and Black has excellent play, e.g. 15.c5 dxc5
16.Nc4 Nd4) 13...Qc8 14.Be3 Ba8 15.Qc2. White has lost time on the pawn win.
Black is harmoniously developed, White's Na3 is badly placed. Black opens up the centre and has sufficient compensation: 15...Nb4 16.Qb1 Qb7 (16...d5 also comes into consideration) 17.f3 (17.Bf3? is wrong due to 17...Nc6! 18.b3 Ne5 and Black has a clear advantage) 17...d5 and for the price of only one pawn Black has excellent play. Now, it is logical for White is to develop one of his rooks. Question: which rook to which file?
13.Rfd1
A number of strong players have opted for this move. I would personally prefer
13.Rad1 followed by Nab1, aiming to quickly solve the Na3 problem.
White can also postpone the decision about his rooks and improve his queen first:
13.Qc2 Nc5 14.Qd2 and after a few more moves, 14...Bf6 15.f3 Be5 16.Rf2,
the situation is in a way similar to our game. Black did not choose the right plan here with 16...Qh4. Black's planned queen activity will only give White the time to coordinate his forces (the correct decision was similar to Abdusattorov's in our game: 16...f5! and Black is ready to open up the position while White still needs to redeploy his Na3. After 17.exf5, interestingly Black gets good play with either recapture: 17...exf5 / Rxf5 18.Nd5 Ne7) 17.g3 Qf6
18.Rd1 Qg6
19.Nab1!. White has coordinated his forces and is now ready for action. 19...Rad8
20.f4! Bxc3 21.Nxc3. White has well-coordinated pieces, the bishop pair, and more
space, while Black's queen is 'overdeveloped'. 21...Ne7 22.f5! exf5. White has a winning advantage, but, as usual, precision is needed: 23.exf5! (the game Lupulescu-Nisipeanu, Khanty-Mansiysk 2009, went 23.Bxc5 bxc5 24.exf5 Qf6 and was later drawn) 23...Nxf5 24.Bxc5. Now Black is forced into a piece sacrifice that doesn't work: 24...Nxg3 (24...bxc5?? loses a piece for nothing after the simple 25.Bd3 Bc8 26.Qf4) 25.hxg3 Qxg3+
26.Kf1 Qh3+ 27.Ke1 bxc5.
analysis diagram White probably evaluated this position wrongly and therefore went for 23.Bxc5. Yes, at the moment Black does have three pawns for the piece, but White's pieces are better coordinated and his king is actually quite safe. After 28.Qf4 White has a winning advantage as Black's king will soon become a target.
13...Nc5 14.Qc2 Bf6
15.f3?
White is making seemingly standard Hedgehog moves, but probably he was not aware of Black's plan. I do not know whether Nodirbek knew Mamedyarov's game from 16 years earlier, but Shakhriyar went for exactly the same plan! 15.Rac1 Be5
16.Nab1.
Black is ready to open up the position: 16...f5! 17.f4! (White defends in the best way under the circumstances; after 17.exf5 his king would quickly become a target and Black has a pleasant choice between 17...Rxf5 and the more inventive 17...Ne7)
17...Bxc3 18.Nxc3 fxe4 19.a3 (White will get his pawn back, but Black has excellent
play) 19...e5 20.Nd5
20...Nd4 (this allows a relative simplification into equality. A good alternative was
20...a5!? when Black has the advantage after 21.fxe5 Nxe5 22.Bxc5 bxc5 23.Qxe4
a4!) 21.Bxd4 exd4 22.Rxd4 Ne6 23.Rxe4 Bxd5 24.cxd5 Nxf4 (Black does not have enough pieces for a real attack on White's king) 25.Bf3 (better was 25.Bg4 Qg5
26.Be6+ with approximate equality) 25...Qg5 26.Ree1 Rf6 27.Kh1 Raf8 28.Be4
Rh6. Black's situation has improved in the last couple of moves, but White is far from getting mated. White now made a terrible blunder, bringing the game to an abrupt end: 29.Rf1?? (he had to go for 29.Qc3) 29...Rxh2+! 0-1, Naiditsch-Mamedyarov, Fügen 2006. White first loses his queen and then more: 30.Kxh2 Qh5+ 31.Kg1 Ne2+
32.Qxe2 Qxe2 33.Bxh7+ Kxh7 34.Rxf8 Qe3+.
15...Be5 16.Bf1
16...f5!
White's knight is still stranded on a3 and Mamedyarov's plan now works much better! Black is clearly better here. The position opens up, and White is in essence a piece down (the Na3). It is difficult when a player has to choose between different bad possibilities. Salem takes a reasonable practical decision:
17.f4
An attempt at some flashy defence like 17.exf5 Rxf5 18.Nd5 fails as the knight is not doing much on d5 and Black has several good ways to achieve a winning advantage:
18...Qh4 (the simple 18...Ne7 should work well too) 19.f4 Raf8 20.fxe5 exd5
21.cxd5 Nxe5 and Black has a winning attack.
17...Bxc3 18.Qxc3 Nxe4 19.Qb3
White has the bishop pair, will get his pawn back, and if he doesn't get mated he will probably survive. White's biggest problem? Playing a complicated position essentially a piece down (the Na3)!
19...Rb8
The immediate attack 19...g5 was probably even stronger.
20.Bxb6
Stockfish suggests trying to bring the knight into play by 20.Nb1 as a better chance to survive. Well, Black has two good options here: 20...Nc5, keeping his extra pawn, or going for an attack with 20...g5.
20...Qh4 21.Qe3
21.g3 is similar to the game situation after 21...Qe7 22.Qe3 and Black opens the
white king's position with either 22...g5 or 22...e5 - a pleasant choice.
21...e5!
As said, 21...g5! was also good.
22.g3 Qf6 23.Bg2 exf4 24.gxf4
24.Qxf4? loses tons of material after 24...Qxb2 25.Qe3 Nc3.
24...Qg6
Now White attemps to finally bring his knight back into play:
25.Nc2
25...Ne5!
Direct and strong. Stockfish prefers 25...Ba8 26.Ne1 Rfe8 and either White loses his bishop (on b6) or he gets mated: 27.Bd4 Nxd4 28.Qxd4 (28.Rxd4 Nc3) 28...Nc3
29.Qxc3 Rxe1+ 30.Rxe1 Qxg2#.
26.Qe2
26.fxe5 loses to 26...f4 followed by ...f3.
26...Ng4 27.Rd3 Nef6
White simply has too many hanging pieces.
28.Bd4 Rfe8 29.Qf1 Nh5 30.Rd2
Black chooses a nice finish:
30...Re4!
30...Qh6 also wins.
31.Re1 Rxf4 32.Qd3 Nf2!
And White resigned. The 'Kan Hedgehog' Diagrammed is the Hedgehog position arising from the Kan Sicilian (this type of Hedgehog may also arise from the English Opening). White's knight is now placed on d4 and does not need to be improved. Black has just opted for one of the typical counterplay plans by pushing ...h5. I have selected three games here and hope they will give the reader a 'good grip' on the right timing of the h-pawn push for Black and how to deal with it as White. This diagram shows the dilemma White often faces. Black has just pushed ...h3 and White must decide how to react. In this position he should take gxh3!. The silicon brain also tends to take the pawn in such situations. Black's h-pawn push Game 15 Veselin Topalov 2737 Rustam Kasimdzhanov 2652 Tripoli FIDE-Wch KO 2004 We have here a top-level example of Black's h-pawn push and a poor reaction to it on White's part.
1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 e6 3.d4 cxd4 4.Nxd4 a6 5.c4 Nf6 6.Nc3 Qc7 7.a3 b6 8.Be3 Bb7 9.f3
d6 10.Be2 Be7 11.O-O O-O 12.Qd2 Nbd7 13.Rac1 Rac8 14.Rfd1 Qb8 15.Bf1 Rfe8
16.Kh1 Bd8
Both sides have been playing typical Hedgehog moves. Black has not shown his hand yet. He can still choose between all three standard plans: the h-pawn push, the plan with ...Bc7, ...Kh8, ...Rg8, ...g5, or staying flexible and aiming for a timely ...d5 pawn break. Topalov plays another regular Hedgehog move:
17.Bg1
Now Kasim shows his hand:
17...h5!?
How should White react? As we will also see in the comments to the next game, Dominguez-Andreikin, most white players prefer not to touch the h-pawn. Topalov takes the same 'human' approach as Dominguez did: 'do not touch the h-pawn, do not risk creating a weakness'.
18.Qf2
White's best reaction was 18.h3 when after the logical 18...h4 19.Bh2 Nh5 analysis diagram
20.Nde2! covers the g3-square and makes sure White keeps the dark- squared
bishop: 20...Ne5 21.b3 Be7. As mentioned in a similar situation in the game Dominguez-Andreikin, e3 is a good square for the white queen here: 22.Qe3! and White is ready to push f4. The silicon brain prefers White. In human play I would say the game is unclear.
18...Ne5
Black's pawn could have continued on its journey: 18...h4. Most probably, Rustam did not play this because he was not sure about the position resulting after the following pawn sacrifice: 19.h3 (Black is at least okay after the pawn structure change with 19.Qxh4 Nxe4) 19...Nh5. Now White has to part with his bishop:
20.Bh2 (20.Nce2? is not good due to 20...Ne5 21.b3 b5!)
analysis diagram
20...Ng3+! 21.Bxg3 hxg3 22.Qxg3 Nf6. The bishop pair is important here as Black
will open up the position with the ...d5 break at some stage; Black has sufficient compensation.
19.b3 Ng6 20.b4?
The right approach was to touch the h-pawn: 20.h3! h4 21.Bh2 Nh5 22.Nde2.
20...h4 21.Nb3
Black now accomplishes his plan:
21...h3!
Should White take the black pawn or should he ignore it? The decision is difficult as White is clearly worse in both cases. Veselin decides to ignore the pawn.
22.g3
In an ideal world (it will not happen in this position) White hopes to preserve his pawn structure while at some stage collecting the pawn with Bxh3. Unfortunately for White, he does not get the opportunity to do this. In answer to 22.gxh3 Black has different good options. The most straightforward central pawn break is a good one: 22...d5 (22...Ne5 and later breaking with ...d5 is also good) 23.exd5 exd5. analysis diagram A) White gets devastated if he plays 24.cxd5 Rxc3 (the simple 24...Qa8 followed by ...Nxd5 is also not bad) 25.Rxc3 Nxd5 (White's pieces have poor coordination; Black has a winning advantage) 26.Rcd3 Bh4 27.Qd4 Ngf4 etc.; B) 24.c5 Nd7 (also better for Black are the positions resulting from the thematic pawn sac 24...d4 25.Rxd4 Bc7) 25.Nxd5 Nde5 26.Bg2 Qa8 - White cannot defend on the a8-h1 diagonal and this will prove decisive here.
22...Ne5 23.Rd4
Here Kasimdzhanov made the only mistake in this game, agreeing to a draw by move repetition:
23...Nc6?
Black has a large, close to winning advantage. Best would have been to open up the position further with 23...b5! and White does not have a good way to keep his stuff together. Black's bishop coming to b6 is very unpleasant for White: 24.c5 dxc5
25.Nxc5 Bb6.
analysis diagram White would love to solve the problem of the pin on the a7-g1 diagonal and also finally collect the h3-pawn... but he cannot get it done: 26.Rdd1 (26.Bxh3? loses to
26...Nfd7 27.Rdd1 Nxc5 28.bxc5 Bxc5 29.Qe2 Bxa3) 26...Qa8!. The pressure along
the a8-h1 diagonal has been increased while Black's queen no longer hangs once Black plays ...Nd7 and White takes. White's best option here is to finally grab the annoying pawn: 27.Bxh3 Nfd7. ...Nxc5 is coming, and White is in a bad shape here, while 28.Qd4 only delays the inevitable. Black has a large advantage after 28...f6 or
28...Rcd8 29.Qe3 Nxc5 30.bxc5 Ba5 31.Bg2 Nc4.
23...Qa8, though less forcing, leads to Black's advantage too.
24.Rdd1 Ne5 25.Rd4 Nc6?
1⁄2-1⁄2 White pushes a4, Black responds ...a5 Game 16 Leinier Dominguez Perez 2726 Dmitry Andreikin 2687 Havana 2011
1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 e6 3.d4 cxd4 4.Nxd4 a6 5.c4 Nf6 6.Nc3 Bb4 7.Bd2 Qc7 8.a3 Be7
9.Be3 d6 10.Be2 O-O 11.O-O b6 12.Qd2 Bb7 13.f3 Nbd7 14.Rfc1!?
We do not often see the rooks positioned on a1 and c1 in such positions. White has a specific plan in mind (similar to Agrest-Nisipeanu below).
14...Rac8 15.a4!?
The standard queenside pawn push 15.b4 is certainly an option here. Like in Agrest-Nisipeanu, White wants to push a5 and Black stops this in an unusual way!
15...a5!?
I have rarely seen such a pawn structure - actually I cannot recall any other top game with it! Black stops White's pawn advance at the expense of giving White the b5- square. How important is it? Is White better here? It doesn't look that way. White has the b5-square for his knight, but Black's knight has obtained a very stable post on c5. Black seems to have no problems defending his d6-pawn, so the position is probably balanced. What alternative plans did Black have? Advancing the h-pawn is a standard plan, so let's see how it works here: 15...h5 16.b4. A) If 16.a5 bxa5 17.Nb3, White does accomplish his plan of bringing his knight to a5, however after 17...h4 18.Nxa5 Ba8 analysis diagram Black has adequate counterplay, White does not have a free hand to push his queenside pawns. One way for White to deal with Black's h-pawn advance is to bring his knight to f2:
16.Nd1. Now, if Black wants to, he can also push 16...a5 and have a reasonably good
version of the game; B) 16.b4 h4 (trying to use the fact that White's b4-pawn is not protected and going for a central break with 16...d5 may backfire as White has the strong piece sacrifice
17.Nxd5! exd5 18.cxd5 Qb8 19.Nf5; 16...Ne5 does not worry White as he has
17.Nd1) 17.a5 bxa5 18.Rxa5.
analysis diagram After 18...Ne5! (the immediate 18...h3 allows the nice rook swing 19.Rg5! and it is White who will attack on the kingside!) the position is unclear. Initially, the engine slightly prefers White, however there are many dynamic/tactical ideas: 19.Nd1 (if
19.h3 - White wants to play 20. f4 - Black has his trumps: 19...Nh5! (the pawn grab
19...Nxc4?? blunders the queen: 20.Bxc4 Qxc4 21.Nce2) 20.f4 Ng3! 21.fxe5 dxe5
the whole board is hanging; Stockfish gives zeros) 19...h3 20.g3 (20.gxh3 is possible but quite risky here). analysis diagram In an ideal world, White wants to keep his kingside pawn structure intact and collect Black's pawn with Nd1-f2-h3. 20...Qd7 (Black also has piece sacrifice ideas:
20...Bxe4!? 21.fxe4 Nxe4 22.Qe1 Qb7) 21.Nf2 and now is the time for the central
pawn break 21...d5 with an unclear game. Was 15...h5 an option? Yes, it certainly was. Another possibility was 15...Qb8 and in case of 16.a5 bxa5 17.Rxa5 (White cannot bring his knight to a5 as 17.Nb3? blunders a pawn to 17...Bxe4) 17...Ne5 it is not easy for White to advance further on the kingside; the position is balanced.
16.Ndb5 Qb8
17.Bf4
White wants to take advantage of his knight on b5 and put pressure on the d6-pawn. Anther way to do this was 17.Re1 Rcd8 18.Rad1 Nc5 19.Bf4. analysis diagram The pawn win appears not to bring White any advantage here: 19...Nh5! 20.Bxd6 Bxd6 21.Nxd6 e5 and the Nc5 is well placed while the Be2 locked up by its own pawns; Black is definitely not worse, e.g. 22.Qg5 (or 22.Ncb5 Bc6) 22...Rxd6
23.Qxh5 Rxd1 24.Rxd1 Bc6.
Dominguez most probably rejected 17.Rd1 because matters don't look clear after
17...Nc5.
17...Ne5 18.b3 Rfd8 19.Kh1
Andreikin now decides in favour of one of Black's standard Hedgehog plans: pushing the h-pawn:
19...h5
The alternative was to bring Nf6 to the nice c5 outpost with 19...Nfd7 20.Rd1 Nc5
21.Rab1 when the position is probably about equal.
How should White react to Black's pawn push? What I noticed is that most white players prefer not to touch their h-pawn, and here this is also the case.
20.Bf1
In this and most similar positions, Stockfish has much less trouble 'creating weaknesses' and happily plays 20.h3!. Now, after the most logical follow-up 20...h4
21.Bh2, Black seems to be doing well optically - one knight goes to h5, another to
g6, dark-square control... However, in practice it does not work that well here, for example 21...Ng6 (21...Nh5?? blunders a piece after the simple 22.f4) 22.Qe3! (the white queen is well placed on e3; it prepares the f4-push while also subsequently covering the g3-square) 22...Bc6 23.Rd1. White has a relatively simple plan here: double the rooks to keep Black busy defending the d6-pawn, and then at a convenient moment push f4. Black does not have an easy life here, as counterplay attempts like 23...Nh5 lose a pawn for no compensation after 24.f4 Ng3+ 25.Bxg3 hxg3 26.Bh5 Nf8 27.Qxg3.
20...h4
Now Black is fine. The position is about equal but probably easier to play with Black.
21.Qf2
21.h3 now does not bring the same result as after 21...Nh5 22.Bh2 Ng6
analysis diagram
23.Qf2 (in reply to 23.Ne2, Black has a nice idea in 23...Rc5! and White can easily
get in trouble, e.g. 24.Qe3? Bg5! 25.f4 Bh6 with the threat 26...e5; White's pawns are shaky and the evaluation is minus two!) 23...Ng3+! 24.Bxg3 hxg3 25.Qxg3 Bf6 Black has excellent compensation for his sacrificed pawn.
21...Rc5
Black is getting ready for the typical Hedgehog break ...d5. Could Black immediately go for 21...d5 ? Yes, he could. It does require some good calculation though: 22.cxd5 Nd3! 23.Bxd3 Qxf4 24.Qxb6. analysis diagram At moments like these, a human player often stops calculating and (instead of
21...d5!?) looks for some other moves (like 21...Rc5 in the game - so that b6 will not
be hanging). Black is actually doing pretty well here: 24...Bxd5! 25.exd5 (25.Ne2?? blunders into the simple 25...Rxc1+ 26.Rxc1 Qd2) 25...Nxd5. Black gets his sacrificed piece back, and White is the one who needs to be careful here: 26.Qg1! Nxc3 27.Nxc3 Rxd3 and White bails out into a drawn rook endgame with 28.Nd5! Rxc1 29.Nxe7+ Kf8 30.Qxc1 Qxc1+ 31.Rxc1 Kxe7 32.h3. A draw will be the outcome of this tactical tussle: 32...Kd6 33.Rc8 Rxb3 34.Ra8 etc.
22.Be3 d5!
Black judges well that the central break works and goes for it. For a better understanding of this position it is good to notice that in the event of
22...Ng6!? 23.Bxc5 dxc5, Black has full compensation for the sacrificed exchange.
analysis diagram For example, 24.Rd1 Rf8! followed by ...Nh5 and ...f5.
23.exd5 exd5 24.cxd5
Andreikin ignores the threat to his rook and decides to weaken White's king position.
24...h3! 25.Rd1
Black is fine in the event of 25.Bxc5 Bxc5 26.Qg3 as White has to give his extra exchange back: 26...hxg2+ 27.Bxg2 Nd3 28.Rc2 Nf2+ 29.Rxf2 Qxg3 30.hxg3 Bxf2
31.Kh2 Bc5. Black has suffient compensation for the pawn and is not worse here.
(Of course not 31...Nxd5?? which blunders into a pin and material loss) after
32.Rd1.)
25...Nxd5 26.Bxc5 Bxc5 27.Qg3 Nxc3
The position is sharp, but still approximately equal.
28.Rxd8+?
Most probably a time-pressure blunder.
28.Nxc3 led to a forced sequence of moves with a drawish outcome: 28...hxg2+
(28...Bd4 transposes after 29.f4! hxg2+ 30.Bxg2 Bxg2+ 31.Qxg2 Bxc3= etc.)
29.Bxg2 Bd4 30.f4!.
analysis diagram And we get a peaceful outcome after 30...Bxg2+ 31.Qxg2 Bxc3 32.Rxd8+ Qxd8
33.Rc1 and now a few more pieces leave the board: 33...Bb2 (or 33...Ng6 34.Rxc3
Qd1+ 35.Qg1 Qd5+=) 34.Qxb2 Nd3 35.Qd2 Qa8+ 36.Kg1 Nxc1 37.Qxc1 with a dead drawn queen ending.
28...Qxd8!
Black's threats are obvious, White either suffers decisive material loss or gets mated.
29.Qxe5
Or 29.Nxc3 Qd4.
29...Nd1 30.Ra2 Ne3 31.Nc3 Nxf1 32.Re2 Nd2 33.Qg3 hxg2+ 34.Rxg2 g6 0-1
White pushes the a-pawn, Black counters with his h-pawn Game 17 Evgenij Agrest 2554 Liviu-Dieter Nisipeanu 2584 Batumi Ech-tt 1999
1.c4 e6 2.Nc3 b6 3.e4 Bb7 4.Nf3 c5 5.d4 cxd4 6.Nxd4 d6 7.Be2 Nf6 8.f3 a6 9.Be3
Nbd7 This position can also arise from the Kan Sicilian. If Black is worried about White's a-pawn push, he can delay developing the Nb8 with 9...Be7 10.O-O O-O when 11.a4 doesn't achieve its aim due to 11...Nc6.
10.O-O Be7
And now White goes for a plan similar to Dominguez-Andreikin.
11.a4 O-O 12.a5 bxa5 13.Nb3 Rb8 14.Nxa5 Ba8 15.Qd2
White has achieved his aim: his knight is well placed on a5, his queenside pawns are ready to move. White's plan is simple: push the b-pawn. Black cannot really stop this, so he urgently needs to find something. What is Black's best counterplan here? Answer: pushing the h-pawn. Nisipeanu ultimately understands this, but he loses precious time in the process!
15...Re8?!
On this move or the next, Black had to start with the immediate 15...h5! with sufficient counterplay.
16.Kh1 Qc7?! 17.Rfc1
With his last two moves, Black has not really improved his position, while White is ready to push his b-pawn.
17...Ne5 18.Bd4
Black now decides on the right counterplay; however, precious time has been lost. Black is in trouble here.
18...h5! 19.b4! h4
19...Rxb4?? was bad due to the simple 20.Nb5 axb5 21.Qxb4 and White is an
exchange up with a better position.
20.b5!
Black cannot stop White on the queenside, so for better or worse, he needs to keep pushing his pawn:
20...h3
The critical moment. How should White react?
21.g3?
Agrest reacts in a way similar to Topalov and Dominguez: preserve the structure, collect the pawn on h3 later. Correct was 21.gxh3! when Black has many tactical ideas, but they don't work. White has a large advantage. The pawn will stay on h3 until the end of the game and due to White's king weakness Nisipeanu eventually saves the game.
21...axb5 22.cxb5
Putting the queen on c7 was not a good idea in the first place.
22...Qd8!
Now White creates a strong passer on c6, probably thinking he had a winning advantage.
23.Bxe5 dxe5 24.Qxd8 Rexd8 25.Nc6 Bxc6 26.bxc6
Black saves the game due to White's weak king; the pawn on h3 is doing an excellent job.
26...Rd2 27.Ba6
Or 27.Bf1 Rbb2 28.Ne2 Bd8! 29.c7 Bxc7 30.Rxc7 Rxe2 31.Bxe2 Rxe2 with a draw like in the game.
27...Rbb2
The silicon brain will explain that 27...Ne8 was good as well, but the text is more human.
28.Ne2 Bd6 29.c7 Bxc7 30.Rxc7 Rxe2 31.Bxe2 Rxe2
White's king is 'inside the box' and the extra exchange doesn't matter here.
32.Rf1 g5 33.g4 Kg7 34.Kg1 Rg2+ 35.Kh1 Re2 36.Rc3 Nd7 37.Rfc1 Rf2 38.Kg1
Rg2+ 39.Kh1 Rf2 1⁄2-1⁄2 Fresh ideas for White The diagrammed position comes from the Kan Sicilian. Here we see a relatively new concept that will be more deeply explored! White has just pushed g4 and is starting a Scheveningen-type pawn storm. Do NOT confuse this with the first two introductory diagrams in this chapter as here the situation is VERY different. White's knight is well-placed on d4, so he does not run the risk of 'missing a piece'. White's attack can develop fast here! Game 18 Yasser Seirawan Nick de Firmian Estes Park 1986
1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 e6 3.d4 cxd4 4.Nxd4 a6 5.c4 Nf6 6.Nc3 Qc7
7.Be2!?
The text move is considerably less often played than 7.a3, but to me it is far from clear which move is the most precise. Black has two logical options: a) continue Hedgehog development with 7...b6 or b) try to exploit the fact that White hasn't played 7.a3 and play 7...Bb4. Let's have a look at both.
7...b6
A) 7...Bc5, played by Bronstein, does not look inspiring: 8.Be3 d6 9.O-O Bd7 10.a3 O-O 11.b4 Ba7 12.Rc1 White has a typical Hedgehog position while Black looks passive. White is going to trade the dark- squared bishops (a good trade for White here!): 12...Rc8 13.Qd2 Be8
14.Rfd1 Nbd7 15.Nb3 Bxe3 16.Qxe3 Ne5 17.c5 with an easy, risk-free advantage.
(17.h3 was played in Honfi-Bronstein, Miskolc 1963. White later spoiled his position and even lost.) B) 7...Bb4
8.O-O (8.Qd3 can of course be played - probably transposing to 9.Qd3 below - but
White should not really object to Black grabbing a pawn here) and now: B1) 8...Bxc3 9.bxc3 Nxe4 is asking for trouble after 10.Bf3 Nc5 11.Nb3
11...d6 (11...O-O? leads more or less to a lost position after 12.Nxc5! - 12.Qd4 d6
13.Rd1 was played in Shirov-Fedorov, Riga 2014, where Black eventually survived
- 12...Qxc5 13.Qa4 and Black simply cannot develop). Now White can reach a better ending with a relatively forced sequence: 12.Bf4 e5 13.Nxc5 Qxc5 14.Be3 Qc7
15.Qd5 O-O 16.Rfd1 Nc6 17.Qxd6 Qxd6 18.Rxd6 with play for two results: maybe
Black makes a draw, maybe not; B2) 8...O-O 9.Qd3 d6 10.Bd2. Similar to Bronstein's 7...Bc5, we have a Hedgehog position with the black bishop 'out'. To me, the bishop looks more natural on e7 in these positions. 10...Nbd7 (to
10...Nc6, probably White's best reaction is 11.Nxc6! bxc6 and now he can take
space 12.a3 Bc5 13.b4 Ba7 14.Bg5 with an easy advantage) 11.Nb3 Ne5 12.Qd4 Nc6 13.Qe3 Bd7 14.Rac1 Rac8. White now took the bishop pair with 15.a3 and had an advantage in Naiditsch-Ivanchuk, Danzhou 2017. White has two dangerous 'Sicilian pawn storm plans' here (both a little unusual for the Kan Hedgehog). In both cases Black holds a dynamic balance... if... a computer is playing.
8.Be3
The other option is 8.O-O Bb7 9.Qd3
9...d6 (9...Nc6 leads to a safe advantage for White after 10.Nxc6! Bxc6 11.Be3 Bc5
12.Bxc5 bxc5 13.f4 with d-file pressure and more space, Shomoev-Khismatullin,
Khanty-Mansiysk 2015). A) Now White can start a standard Sicilian pawn storm with 10.f4 Nbd7 11.b4 Be7
12.Be3 O-O 13.Rac1
13...Rac8 (13...Rad8? runs into a textbook tactic: 14.Nd5! exd5 15.cxd5 and White
got his piece back - 15...Qb8 is refuted by 16.Nc6 - and had a clear advantage in Khalifman-Akopian, Minsk 2014). Now we have an interesting situation: White starts a 'Scheveningen Sicilian pawn storm'! 14.g4!. White has five pawns on the fourth rank and yet he isn't overstretched! A1) 14...Qd8 15.g5. Now White has a winning advantage. This is a Hedgehog where the Scheveningen pawn storm works perfectly for White: 15...Ne8 16.Qd2
16...Nc7 (breaks of the 16...d5 type sometimes save Black in similar situations... but
not here! 17.cxd5 Bxb4 18.dxe6 Nc5. Now White first wins an exchange and later probably the game with the tactic 19.Nc6! Qxd2 20.Bxd2 Rxc6 21.e7) 17.a3 Re8
18.Nb3 (Stronger was just continuing the Scheveningen pawn storm with 18.h4!.
White has advanced so many of his pawns and yet Black does not have a good pawn break!) 18...f6 19.h4! Rf8. White understands he needs his Nb3 as an attacking piece: 20.Nd4! fxg5 21.hxg5 and White had a winning attack in Brkic-Gajewski, Jerusalem 2015 (1-0, 43); A2) Black is perhaps not worse if... a computer is playing, after 14...h6! 15.h4 analysis diagram
15...h5! 16.g5 Ng4 17.Bxg4 hxg4 18.Nce2. It looks like 19. Ng3 next will be
slaughter but Black has defensive resources: 18...g6! 19.Ng3 e5!. analysis diagram Now White has several beautiful ideas, all leading to a 'zeros' evaluation: 20.Ndf5! (or 20.h5 exd4 21.Bxd4 Ne5!) 20...gxf5 21.Nxf5. To a human player this looks terribly dangerous for Black but apparently the position is dynamically balanced:
21...Rce8! 22.Nh6+ Kh7 23.f5 and it all ends peacefully with a move repetition:
23...Qc6 24.Qd5 Qc7 25.Qd3 Qc6.
B) An interesting novel idea is 10.Qg3!? Nbd7 (the pawn grab 10...Nxe4?! 11.Nxe4 Bxe4 is at least risky: 12.Re1 Nc6 13.Bf3! Bxf3 14.Qxf3 Rc8. analysis diagram Black's pawn defences need to be destroyed: 15.Nxe6! fxe6 16.Rxe6+ Be7 17.Bg5 and Black is in bad shape; 17...Nd4? loses to 18.Qh5+ g6 19.Rxg6) 11.f3. analysis diagram It looks logical to fianchetto the bishop here: 11...g6 12.Be3 Bg7 13.Rac1 O-O. At first glance, this looks like a normal Hedgehog, but my Stockfish is very enthusiastic for White, evaluating plus one!
8...Bb7 9.f3 d6
It is perhaps useful to mention that 9...Bd6? is a tempo loss as after 10.Qd2 White threatens 11. Ndb5 and Black has nothing better than 10...Be7 (10...Bxh2 loses to
11.O-O-O with many threats). White is simply a tempo up compared to regular lines
and here went for the most aggressive continuation 11.O-O-O Nc6 12.Kb1 Ne5
13.Rc1 and White went on to win in Ivanchuk-Kamsky, lichess.org blitz 2020.
10.O-O Be7 11.Rc1 Nbd7
We have our standard Kan Sicilian Hedgehog with the difference that White has not played a3. If White wants a queenside a3, b4 build up he can still play 12.a3, transposing. However, White can also opt for a much more aggressive set-up!
12.Qe1!? O-O
And now White goes for a Sicilian pawn storm!
13.g4!
White is combining Hedgehog central control with a Sicilian pawn roll. Please note that White can also apply similar plans in lines with 7.a3. It just looks to me that if White is willing to go for such a set-up, this is the best move-order and the most efficient way to do it. The resulting positions are very sharp and easy to get wrong. It started as a standard Hedgehog but now the only thing making this a Hedgehog is White's pawn on c4, otherwise we have an open Sicilian where White applies a bayonet pawn roll on the kingside! Interestingly, there are almost no games here! We have one top-level game from almost forty years ago, then one game between top engines, and not much else - definitely an area to explore further! The first tough decision for Black is whether or not to play ...h6 - never an easy decision in such positions. In our human top-level game and also in the engines' top- level game, Black opted for 13...h6.
13...h6
Allowing White to roll his pawns undisturbed is not a good idea; after 13...Ne8 14.g5 g6 15.h4 Ng7 16.f4 Rfe8 17.f5 exf5 18.Nd5 Qd8 19.exf5 White was clearly better and easily won in Wagner-Sachdev, Biel 2018.
14.h4 Nh7
White gets ready to bring his rook to the h-file.
15.Kg2
White could also roll his pawns differently with 15.Qg3. If Black wants to follow Komodo's type of play with 15...Qd8 (see the next comment) White can continue with 16.Rcd1 Re8 (16...Bxh4 17.Qxd6 is probably better for White) and now: A) Pawn sacrifice ideas like 17.g5 hxg5 18.hxg5 Bxg5 19.f4 are not easy to evaluate: 19...Bf6 20.Rd2 and White's rook will swing to the kingside; my Stockfish evaluates around zeros... not easy to tell; B) 17.Rd2, preparing the g5 push (to sacrifice a pawn under better circumstances) is also an option; C) 17.Bf2 Rc8 18.f4 with interesting play. I would personally prefer to be White, but is a matter of taste. Yasser Seirawan took a drastic step to stop White's pawn roll:
15...g5!?
In a high-level computer game, Komodo went for 15...Qd8. Obviously, these engines are much stronger than me, while to use my weaker engine to analyse top engine games looks stupid. So I will just give some moves of that game: 16.Rh1 Re8
17.Qg3 Ndf8 18.f4 (18.Rcd1 is an alternative)
It looks as if Black will fall victim to White's bayonet pawn roll, but Black has resources: 18...Bf6! 19.g5 hxg5 20.fxg5 (Black can counter 20.hxg5 with 20...Bxd4
21.Bxd4 e5 22.fxe5 Qxg5 with sharp play, my 'weak Stockfish' giving me zeros)
20...Be5 21.Qg4 f5! 22.Qh3 Ng6 with a sharp game ending in a draw, Stoofvlees-
Komodo, TCEC 2020.
16.hxg5 hxg5
Black did stop White's pawn and has also secured himself an outpost on e5; however, it's the h-file that matters! White has an advantage.
17.Rh1 Rfe8 18.Qg3 Ndf8 19.Rh6 Bf6 20.Rch1
Black is not exactly getting mated, but the pressure on the h-file is unpleasant for him here.
20...Be5 21.Qf2 Rab8
Now White improves his knight:
22.Nc2! Bc8 23.Nb4 f6 24.Nd3
Black has to part with his bishop (though doubling White's pawns).
24...Bxc3 25.bxc3 Re7
White improves his knight again:
26.Nb4! Rg7 27.Bd3 a5 28.Nc2
White's knight on d4 will annoying, while playing 28...e5 allows White to bring his knight to e3, targeting the d5- and f5-squares. White definitely has an advantage here, and Black faces unpleasant dilemmas. Yasser's problems were solved by probably the only mistake Nick made in this game - a draw offer! It was gladly accepted. Typical piece sacrifices for White The diagrammed position shows a typical piece sacrifice idea for White.Black is a piece up, there no deadly threats, and yet Black is in deep trouble! Though we have relatively little games featuring this sacrifice concept, it is dangerous for Black, and computer engines confirm this. Game 19 Pascal Charbonneau 2510 Viswanathan Anand 2803 Turin ol 2006
30.a4
This looks sharp, but 30.Nd5! leads to a winning advantage as after 30...exd5
31.cxd5 Black's bishops are killed (meaning 'no attack') and, apart from dominating,
White will also start collecting some material, e.g. 31...Ne8 (31...Bd8 loses a piece after 32.Rc8 Bb7 33.Rb8; 31...Qd8 32.Bxg5 (32.Ng3 with Nf5 to follow is also strong) 32...Nxe4 33.fxe4 Rxg5 34.Rxc7; 31...Bb8 32.Bxa6+-) 32.Bxa6 with Ng3- f5 to follow and Black's position will collapse, e.g. 32...Rh4 33.Bb5+- Bd8 34.Rc8. If 30.g4 Rh3 31.Kg2 h5! 32.Kxh3 hxg4+ 33.Kg2 Qh7 is unclear.
30...Bb7
30...Rh4, preparing the ...g4 pawn push, was logical, however White would again
have the killer 31.Nd5!! exd5 32.cxd5 Ne8 33.Bxa6 Ng3. Nf5 will follow, while Black cannot create real counterplay. Still, from a practical standpoint 30...Rh4 was perhaps the best move guided by the logic 'if White did not sac on d5 last move, it is not very likely that he will do it next move'. This is an interesting psychological moment! We are playing against an opponent but also playing against ourselves, and being a strong player (seeing your opponent's best options) does not always help!
31.c5
Could White still sacrifice a piece? The answer is: Yes! After 31.Nd5 exd5 32.cxd5 Bd8 33.Ng3 White has (similar to Hübner-Ligterink below) only one pawn for the piece but has domination and full compensation (as a minimum - and Stockfish agrees!). The game is now tense and probably dynamically balanced. This game has been analysed in many publications (including my own book Sacrifice and Initiative). Interestingly, Vishy was the one to err and the game became one of the biggest 2006 Olympiad upsets.
31...dxc5 32.bxc5 bxc5 33.Rb1 Bc6 34.Bxc5 g4! 35.f4
35...g3?
It's not easy to tell what Anand blundered, but this mistake proves crucial. 35...Nf3! was the way to go, with complicating lines resulting in equality.
36.fxe5! Nxe4 37.Nxe4 Bxe4
Most likely Black overestimated his threats. White has an easy way to deal with the problem:
38.Bd3! Bxg2+ 39.Qxg2 gxh2 40.Bxg6 Rxg6
Black has no attack here because he simply has no pieces left. White chooses an elegant finish:
41.Ng3 Rxg3 42.Qe4 Rg4 43.Be7! 1-0
43...Rxe4 44.Bf6 Qg7 45.Rb8 Bxb8 46.Rd8#.
Game 20 Robert Hübner 2620 Gert Ligterink 2445 Wijk aan Zee 1984 Another good example of a typical sacrifice idea for White. White does not need to sacrifice a piece here, but Robert Hübner's idea is instructive! If Black's bishops are tamed, White will have full domination and this can be achieved by means of a positional piece sacrifice:
29.Nd5!
White also had a reasonably promising pawn sacrifice at his disposal: 29.Ng3. A) If 29...Nxe4 30.Bxe4 Bxe4 White should not be greedy for material but should play for the initiative with 31.Re1! (Black has reasonable compensation for the exchange in the event of 31.Nh5 Kh7 32.Nxg7 Rxg7); B) After 29...Bxe4 White has an unpleasant pawn break: 30.c5! bxc5 31.bxc5 Bxb1
32.c6! and many black pieces are hanging. Black's position looks lost but he can
continue fighting: 32...Ne4 33.Nxe4 Bxe4 34.cxd7 g3! (the key move, creating mate threats) 35.h3 Qd8 36.Rd4! (36.Qxc7?? blunders into a mate after 36...Qh4) 36...Ba5
37.Qa3 Bb7 and White should be better but the game remains complicated, e.g. 38.f5
(or 38.Rb1 Ba8 39.f5) 38...Bb6 39.Rxd6 Qh4 40.Rcc6.
29...exd5 30.cxd5
From a practical perspective (compared to the 29.Ng3 lines) Hübner's choice was an excellent one! Black is now doomed to passivity and cannot think of those flashy lines shown under 29.Ng3. This is an instructive example because most of the players, when they sacrificing a piece and get only one pawn in return, will be looking for a forced justification of the sacrifice. White does not have a 'forced justification' here, but he does have domination! Black's bishops are killed and White's knight will travel to the f5-outpost.
30...Bd8
30...Rc8 31.Nd4 also looks good for White.
31.Bd4
31.Ng3! with Nf5 to follow was more precise.
31...Nh5 32.Bxg7+ Rxg7
33.Nd4
It was probably better to keep the f4-pawn (so as not to allow the blockade on e5) with 33.Rf1.
33...Nxf4 34.Nf5 Ne5 35.Nxd6 f6 36.Qe3 Nfg6 37.Rf1 Rh7
The best defence was 37...Qb8! when the situation is not clear because White has given Black an excellent blockading outpost on e5!
38.Rf5 Qb8 39.Ne8 Bc8 40.Nxf6 Bxf6
The only way to struggle on was 40...Bxf5! 41.Nxh7 Kxh7 42.exf5 Bg5! 43.fxg6+ Kg7 44.Qe1 Bxc1 45.Qxc1 Qd6.
41.Rxf6 b5 42.Rxg6 1-0
A dream position for White The diagrammed position, which occurred in a well-known top-level game, shows a dream situation for White! He has regrouped excellently and is ready to push his pawns on the queenside. Black has a badly placed queen and no counterplay. In a higher sense this position is close to lost for Black! The game is very instructive in the way White (Kasparov) regrouped his pieces and Black (Kramnik) got a terrible position due to just shuffling his pieces around and not coming with a clear plan. To have and have not a plan Can a world champion in a classical game get into a lost position by playing random moves, never achieving any counterplay? Yes, he can! So don't kick yourself if sometimes it happens to you. Game 21 Garry Kasparov 2838 Vladimir Kramnik 2802 Moscow 2001
1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 e6 3.d4 cxd4 4.Nxd4 a6 5.c4 Nf6 6.Nc3 Qc7 7.a3 d6 8.Be3 b6 9.Rc1
Nbd7 We will get a typical Kan Hedgehog position.
10.Be2 Bb7 11.f3 Be7 12.O-O O-O 13.Kh1 Rac8 14.b4 Qb8 15.Qd2
White plans Rc2, Rb1, Na4, Nb2, Nd3, Qc1 and then simply start pushing his queenside pawns. Black obviously needs to plan some counterplay. In such positions, when it comes to planning, computer engines are less helpful than human knowledge/experience. The engine will give many options for Black evaluating at approximately 0.40. In my opinion, the plan Kramnik had to go for was pushing the h-pawn. Vladimir does not decide on a plan and keeps randomly shuffling his pieces around while Garry is executing his plan. As a result, once White's regrouping has been accomplished, he has a close to winning advantage!
15...Bd8
Black could consider 15...Rfe8 16.Rc2 h5.
16.Rc2 Re8
16...h5 again came into consideration. White continues with his plan.
17.Na4 Bc7
It was high time to start counterplay with 17...h5!.
18.Bg1
18...Rcd8?
This shows a lack of any clear plan as the ...d5 push is not really on the cards here. This was the last moment to play 18...h5! and if 19.Qe1, 19...Bd8 followed by ...h4.
19.Rb1
White is now clearly better and it's difficult to give Black clever advice.
19...Ba8
19...h5? is now wrong as there is no follow-up after the simple 20.Qe1.
20.Qc1
The next few random moves do not improve Kramnik's situation; however, without any counterplay his prospects are already bleak here.
20...h6
Kasparov takes the human decision and continues with his plan.
21.Nb2
My Stockfish is also enthusiastic about immediate action with 21.c5.
21...Nf8 22.Nd3
Regrouping accomplished! Now is the time for White to push his queenside pawns and crush Black!
22...Ng6 23.a4
Black's queen is terribly placed.
23...Qc8
White pieces are perfectly positioned for the final onslaught! Time to open the queenside. Which pawn would you push?
24.b5?
Surprising enough, Kasparov chooses for the least strong push.
24.a5 bxa5 25.b5 led to a winning advantage as Black cannot stabilize the queenside
situation:
24.c5 was perhaps strongest. At first glance Black seems to get counterplay after
24...bxc5 25.bxc5 d5.
analysis diagram However, the 'tension' lasts only a few moves: 26.e5! Nxe5 27.Nxe5 Bxe5 28.c6 and Black's queen is horribly placed. White has a winning advantage, e.g. 28...Bc7
29.Qf1!; 28...Qc7 29.Bxa6; or 28...Re7 29.Qf1.
24...a5
Black now stabilizes the queenside.
25.Nc6
It is possible that Kasparov, when deciding on 24.b5, thought that one of the pawn breaks 25.e5 or 25.c5 would work but then figured out that they didn't.
25...Bxc6
25...Rd7? is a mistake due to 26.Nxa5! bxa5 27.c5 and White crushes Black -
probably in the way he was hoping for.
26.bxc6
The lion's share of White's advantage has evaporated. Black stabilizes his situation and equalizes:
26...e5! 27.Bxb6 Ne7
28.c5
Keeping the bishop on was probably better: 28.Bg1! Nxc6 29.Rcb2.
28...d5 29.Bxc7 Qxc7 30.Rb7 Qxc6 31.Rb5 Ng6
Black has active play and the position is now balanced.
32.exd5 Nxd5 33.Nf2 Ngf4 34.Bf1 Ne6 35.Rxa5 Qc7 36.Rb5 Nd4 37.Rc4 Nxb5
38.axb5
We have a material imbalance resulting in equality.
38...Rb8 39.b6 Nxb6 40.cxb6 Qxb6 41.Qe1
Kramnik correctly decides to trade a pair of rooks.
41...Rec8 42.Rxc8+ Rxc8
The position is equal. One would expect White to give his king some air and play h3 or h4 now or on the next move, and then a draw agreement. However we are very far from the last miracle in this game!
43.Ng4 Re8 44.Bd3?!
Played with a wrong idea in mind.
44...Qd4
45.Be4?
This blunders a piece!
45...f5! 46.Bxf5 Ra8
Luckily for White, the loss of the piece is not fatal and he escapes into a drawn ending:
47.Bb1 Qb2 48.h4 Ra1 49.Kh2 Qxb1 50.Qxe5 Qh1+ 51.Kg3 Qe1+ 52.Qxe1 Rxe1
We have reached a theoretically drawn ending. But many mistakes will still be made and there is a lot to learn from this ending! This is, however, not an endgame book, so I will only point out a few important moments.
53.Kf4 Re2 54.Ne3 g6 55.g4 Kf7 56.h5 g5+
After 56...gxh5 57.gxh5 Rh2 58.Kg4 Black's h6-pawn is a target and White has an easy draw.
57.Ke4 Ke6
58.f4
This active defence complicates White's life. 58.Kd4 would have built a fortress, e.g.
58...Rd2+ 59.Ke4 Rb2 60.Nf5! Rb4+ 61.Ke3 Ke5 62.Kf2 Kf4 63.Ng3! Rb3 64.Ne2+
Ke5 65.Ng3 etc.
58...Rf2
As a result of his active defence, White now has to take an important decision.
59.Nd5?
This desicion should have cost him the game.
59.f5+! Kd6 60.Nc4+ still made a draw. Long analyses prove that the king and
knight coordinate well enough to hold.
59.fxg5 also held the draw, however after 59...hxg5 60.Nd5 Rf7 White has to
sacrifice a pawn and understand that he has a drawing fortress: 61.h6! Rh7 62.Nb4 Rxh6 63.Nd3.
59...gxf4 60.Nxf4+ Kf6 61.Ke3 Ra2 62.Nd3 Ra3 63.Ke4
63...Ra1
For some reason, until the end of the game Kramnik refuses to enter with his king:
63...Kg5 when White will run out of moves at some stage.
64.Kf4 Ra4+ 65.Kf3 Ra3 66.Ke4 Rb3 67.Nc5 Rb4+ 68.Kf3 Rb5?
It was still not to late to change his mind and enter with the king on g5: 68...Rc4!
69.Nd7+ Kg5!, winning.
69.Ne4+ Ke5
Now White grabs his chance:
70.g5! Rb4
Black is also in time to draw after 70...Rb3+ 71.Kg4 Kxe4 72.gxh6.
71.Nf2 Rf4+ 72.Kg3 1⁄2-1⁄2
Chapter 4 The Sveshnikov Variation The Sveshnikov Sicilian is rich with ideas, and half this book could have been devoted to it. With our limited space, my choice is personal and I have opted for two ideas for White that I like very much. Also, I think they can be useful for the reader in practical play. One idea is a positional exchange sacrifice; the other is an attacking idea related to a rook swing along the second rank. In both cases, we have quite a number of top-level examples. The exchange sacrifice Diagrammed is the typical exchange sacrifice idea seen in a number of top-level games. We have different versions of this idea, but positionally/strategically, the concept is the same. In return for the exchgange White gets light-square control, a dominant knight on the d5-outpost, and a passed b-pawn. Black is to move in the diagrammed position and has to decide on a plan to create counterplay. Black's best counterplay options here are related to the f-pawn push (...f5). In Kasparov-Shirov, which we will analyse below, White got an even better version of the diagrammed position with an extra pair of knights on the board. The second-rank rook swing The second diagram shows a nice attacking idea for White seen in a couple of top- level games. White has first sacrificed the h-pawn to open the h-file and now has just played b3, clearing the second rank for a rook transfer. White will push f4, then swing his Ra2 to the kingside and obtain a powerful attack. To my knowledge, this idea was invented by Ruslan Ponomariov and it has later been replicated in some top-level games. Exchange sacrifice/light-square domination For a good understanding of the positional exchange sacrifice with which White tries to achieves light-square domination, this game by Kasparov is an important cornerstone, and the next game Anand-Van Wely is another important building block. When the first game was played, it was (to my knowledge) a novel idea. Having to solve new strategic problems in over-the-board play, Shirov quickly got into trouble and Kasparov celebrated a smooth victory. As we will see, things are actually rather complex. Game 22 Garry Kasparov 2805 Alexei Shirov 2740 Horgen 1994
1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 e6 3.d4 cxd4 4.Nxd4 Nf6 5.Nc3 Nc6 6.Ndb5 d6 7.Bf4 e5 8.Bg5 a6
9.Na3 b5 10.Nd5 Be7 11.Bxf6 Bxf6 12.c3
12...Bb7
Predominantly due to this game, this continution has slowly disappeared from practice, perhaps unjustifiably so as Black's play can be improved.
12...Bg5 is nowadays considered to be the main move.
13.Nc2
Black's knight on c6 needs to be improved. Usually Black either opts for the game plan or plays 13...Ne7 which after 14.Nxf6 gxf6 leads to a different pawn structure.
13...Nb8 14.a4
In general, the standard plan for White here. In this particular case, Kasparov already had the ensuing exchange sacrifice in mind.
14...bxa4 15.Rxa4 Nd7
16.Rb4!
Preparing a positional exchange sacrifice. In this game, everything went perfect for White. Either Alexei was not aware of White's plan, or he underestimated it, and White's strategic idea worked to a full extent. There is however a risk associated with White's idea: if the exchange is not sacrificed on b7, the rook will be a bit awkward on b4.
16...Nc5?!
Definitely helping White with the execution of his planned exchange sacrifice; the knight will be out of play on b7. The correct decision was 16...Ra7 when matters are far from clear as White's exchange sac now works considerably less well. A) The exchange sacrifice now leads to approximate (dynamic) equality, e.g.
17.Rxb7 Rxb7 18.Ncb4 (18.b4?, trying to control c5 (similar to Kasparov) now does
not work with Black's knight on d7 as Black is actually better after 18...a5) 18...Nc5 (Black may also opt for 18...a5 when best for White is to gain back the exchange with 19.Ba6 Qa8 20.Bxb7 Qxb7 and it is doubtful if White has any advantage here) analysis diagram
19.Bxa6! Nxa6 20.Nxa6 O-O (Black may decide to collect the b2-pawn: 20...Rxb2,
and after 21.Nab4 (the threat is Qa1) 21...Qa5 22.Qc1 Qa3 23.Nxf6+ gxf6 24.O-O, to me the position looks promising for White but my Stockfish gives around equality)
21.Nab4 and compared to our main game (see below), we have a different situation.
White has compensation for the exchange, but not more; B) White can play for light-square domination with 17.Bc4!?, however after 17...O-O
18.O-O a5...
analysis diagram ... the rook is awkwardly placed on b4; best is to sacrifice a pawn: 19.Ra4 Nc5
20.Ra3 Nxe4 21.Qe2 Ng5 (21...Nc5 leads to White's advantage after 22.b4 Ne6
23.Rfa1) 22.Nce3 Ne6 23.b4 and White definitely has compensation but probably
not more; C) 24 years later, Alexei tried Kasparov's idea as White, but even though he won that game, he didn't get an opening advantage: 17.Nce3 O-O 18.h4!? (this typical idea to limit Black's bishop does not work that well here because Black can improve the bishop in another way) 18...a5 19.Rc4. The critical moment; here Black has a possibility to improve on the game by executing a typical Sveshnikov structure plan! 19...Nc5 (better was 19...Qb8! with ...Bd8 and ...Nb6 to follow. White's rook on c4 is clumsy and Black has a comfortable, perhaps even somewhat better position) 20.b4. Shirov's rook will now be liberated but Black gets the d4-square for his knight: 20...axb4 21.cxb4 Ne6 (White may have had regrets about pushing h4, as now he needs to spend a move protecting it and it can also can be a target for a piece sacrifice in the future) 22.g3 Nd4 (the position can be evaluated as dynamically balanced) 23.Bd3 Ra3 24.O-O
24...g6 (a standard Sveshnikov move, but Black had an interesting tactical option at
his disposal: the piece sacrifice 24...Bxh4!? 25.gxh4 Bxd5 26.exd5 Qxh4. Black already has two pawns for the piece and White's king is not secure, White needs time to coordinate his pieces. Your engine will give you zeros, but in practice it might be easier to play this position as Black) 25.Nc2. Now we get a position with opposite-coloured bishops. 25...Nxc2 26.Qxc2 Bxd5 27.exd5. White has a passed b-pawn, but Black can easily deal with it and is not worse.
27...Qa8? (a step in the wrong direction; correct was 27...Qb8 followed by ...Bd8,
...Bb6, ...f5, with sufficient counterplay) 28.Rc6! Rd8 29.b5 Qa5 30.Rb1. Now White is in the driving seat and his b-pawn is powerful. White soon won in Shirov- Lindh, Sweden tt 2018. After the text move, Kasparov gets what he was hoping for!
17.Rxb7! Nxb7 18.b4
Black's knight on b7 will be passive for quite some time. White has total light- square domination. Compared to Anand-Van Wely (below) White does not have a passed b-pawn, but the presence of an extra pair of knights (Black having a passive one on b7) definitely favours White. Shirov tries to create counterplay by opening the a-file (also giving White a passed b-pawn).
18...Bg5 19.Na3!
The right place for the Nc2 is the c4-square, so first improving the knight is the most precise.
19...O-O 20.Nc4 a5
Kasparov chooses the most human move, completing his development.
21.Bd3
Probably the most precise was 21.h4!. The bishop on h6 controls the (not exactly important) h6-c1 diagonal, but does not control e7, allowing White some tactical motifs: 22.Ncb6! A) After 22...Ra7 we see the effects of Black's bishop being chased to h6 and not controlling the e7-square: 23.Nc8! Ra8 24.Nce7+ Kh8 25.Bb5 and White has total domination; B) 22...Rb8 23.g3 and Black is very passive, Stockfish 15 even gives White a winning advantage (plus two); C) 22...axb4 23.cxb4! (playing for positional domination is the most practical here; on 23.Nxa8 Black can sacrifice a piece with 23...bxc3! (23...Qxa8? is a strategic blunder as after 24.cxb4 White has a huge advantage with his passed b-pawn and total domination): 24.Nab6 Bd2+ 25.Ke2 Nc5 and in a game between humans, this position does not look clear) 23...Ra3 24.Bb5. analysis diagram White has full domination and definitely plenty of compensation. Play may continue
24...f5 25.Nc4 Ra7 26.exf5 Rxf5 27.g3 followed by castling, with light-square
domination while Black doesn't have any counterplay. Such positions are what White aims for with his exchange sacrifice.
21...axb4 22.cxb4
22...Qb8?!
My Stockfish 15 (at a decent depth) advises Black to be patient, to 'sit on his hands' and go for something like 22...Ra7 23.O-O (23.h4?! Bxh4 23.Ncb6 Qe8=) 23...Kh8
24.g3 g6, claiming that it will be difficult for White to improve his position. I have
tried to play this position against my Stockfish, and of course failed to improve White's position; Black has defensive resources. For a human it's not easy to employ a 'rope-a-dope' strategy here, so it's easy to understand that Shirov wants to create counterplay.
23.h4!
This typical idea (send black bishop to h6) improves White's situation here (as tactics, later on, related to Ne7+ will appears).
23...Bh6 24.Ncb6 Ra2 25.O-O Rd2
Black does not really have counterplay as his Rd2 does not have any support.
26.Qf3 Qa7
27.Nd7
The most direct, but not the most precise. The point is that the Bd3 will be hanging in lines where White wants to capture Qxf7. Black's pieces are paralysed and there was no need for White to be in a hurry. Best was 27.Bb5! so as to play Nd7 and, when the Rf8 moves, Ne7+ followed by Qxf7. Black will first lose his extra exchange (since after White's Nd7 his Rf8 cannot move) and then White's b-pawn will decide. Black's Bh8 continues to control plenty of empty squares.
27...Nd8?
This loses quickly. Best was 27...Ra8! when White has a clear advantage but Black can still fight. White's best is to hope for a move repetition (and then play Bb5): A) 28.Ne7+ does not achieve the aim as after 28...Kh8 29.Qxf7, the Bd3 is hanging (therefore 27.Bb5! was needed) and Black can simply take 29...Rxd3 and after
30.Nf8 play 30...Qa2! when White has to force perpetual check with 31.Neg6+ hxg6
32.Nxg6+ Kh7 33.Nf8+;
B) 28.N7b6! Qa3 and now White has nice tactics due to Black's bad king position and bad piece coordination, but not a clear win (28...Rf8 allows the precise 29.Bb5!, with a winning advantage): 29.Nxa8! Rxd3 analysis diagram B1) 30.Nf6+ looks flashy but brings not more than a draw after 30...Kf8! (30...gxf6? loses to 31.Qg4+ Bg7 32.Qc8+ Bf8 though (as usual) White still has to be precise:
33.Nc7! and Black does not get the time to coordinate his pieces: 33...Qxb4 34.Ne8!
d5 35.Nxf6+ Kg7 36.Nh5+ Kg8 37.Qg4+ Kh8 38.Qf5 and White wins in a few moves) 31.Nxh7+ Kg8 32.Nf6+ Kf8 33.Qf5 Qxa8 34.Nd5 Kg8! and White has nothing better than a draw by move repetition 35.Ne7+ Kf8 36.Nd5; B2) 30.Qe2 Rxd5 (30...Rd2 loses to 31.Qb5 Qxa8 32.Nc7! Qb8 33.Ra1) 31.Nb6! (White's knight is needed on b6 as in some lines the move Nd7 is needed; 31.Nc7? is not precise as after 31...Rd4 32.Qg4 g6 33.Qc8+ Bf8 White needs to be able to play Nd7) 31...Rd3 32.Qg4 Rc3 33.Qd7. analysis diagram Here the only way for Black not to get mated immediately is 33...g5 (33...g6? leaves Black's king boxed in after 34.Qe8+ Kg7 35.Nd7 g5 36.h5) 34.Qxb7 - White has a large advantage and should win.
28.Nxf8 Kxf8 29.b5
Now White's life is easy. Black's pieces are still not coordinated. White has a passed b-pawn plus an attack, and Kasparov executes with energetic play right until the end.
29...Qa3 30.Qf5! Ke8 31.Bc4 Rc2 32.Qxh7 Rxc4 33.Qg8+ Kd7 34.Nb6+ Ke7
35.Nxc4 Qc5
White has many ways to finish the game off here; Garry characteristically chooses the most hard-hitting option.
36.Ra1! Qd4 37.Ra3 Bc1
38.Ne3!
A nice concluding move. White had an even nicer move at his disposal with a similar idea: 38.Nxd6!. 1-0 Game 23 Viswanathan Anand 2792 Loek Van Wely 2647 Wijk aan Zee 2006
1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.d4 cxd4 4.Nxd4 Nf6 5.Nc3 e5 6.Ndb5 d6 7.Bg5 a6 8.Na3 b5
9.Nd5 Be7 10.Bxf6 Bxf6 11.c3 Bg5
This is not a theory book, but some opening info never hurts. The text 11...Bg5 has established itself as the main line nowadays because Black is not in a hurry to show his hand by quickly castling. The immediate 11...O-O has been played by a number of very strong players; however, after 12.Nc2 Rb8, 13.h4! ... ... is a clever and useful move - stopping ...Bg5, enabling g3 followed by Bh3, and getting ready to push the h-pawn further (definitely if Black plays ...g6), while still not showing his hand regarding his king position. Black would like to play ...Ne7, trading a pair of knights, but that allows Nxf6+, damaging his kingside pawn structure. A) With Black's king open after 13...Ne7 14.Nxf6+ gxf6 we have two games with Kasparov (as White) castling queenside: 15.Bd3! (in his first outing, Garry went for
15.Qd2 Bb7 16.Bd3 d5 17.exd5 Qxd5 18.O-O-O here, Kasparov-Kramnik, Novgorod
1994. Garry celebrated victory, however Black's play could have been improved and
in the same position a couple of months later he opted for the more precise text move). In Kasparov-Lautier, Moscow 1994, Black followed Kramnik's plan, hoping for counterplay: 15...d5 16.exd5 Qxd5. Now we see the advantage of the 15.Bd3! move-order: 17.Ne3! Qe6 18.Qh5. Just like in the game vs Kramnik, White will castle queenside but here he has a better version: 18...e4 19.Bc2 b4 20.c4 Kh8 21.O-O-O! White's king is safe on the queenside, and he has a better pawn structure plus attacking chances on the kingside. White is clearly better. The game did not last long; I will give it until the end because of the beautiful last move: 21...f5 22.Qg5 Rb6 23.h5 Rc6 (Black does not have any counterplay; if 23...Rg8 24.Qf4 Qh6 the bad coordination of Black's pieces is obvious after 25.Qc7) 24.Kb1 Rc5 (now on 24...Rg8 25.Qf4 Qh6 White has the unpleasant 26.Qb8!) 25.h6! (weaving a mating net!) 25...Qe5 26.Rh5! Rg8. White to play and Black to resign! 27.Ng4!! and mate or decisive material loss cannot be avoided: 27...Rxg5 28.Nxe5 or 27...Qe6 28.Rd8. B) Carlsen, playing Black, took the logical decision to place his bishop on g7 first and then play ...Ne7: 13...g6 14.g3 Bg7 15.h5. Now Black tries to get rid of White's dominant knight: 15...Ne7 16.Nce3 Nxd5 17.Nxd5 Be6. Now Wesley So played a good strategic move that almost always works in such positions: 18.Bh3!. Black is forced to take a decision, as ignoring this move is not easy: 18...Bxd5 (if Black ignore the move anyway and plays 18...Qd7, White has a clear advantage after 19.Bxe6 (my engine also likes 19.h6 Bh8 20.Bxe6 fxe6
21.Ne3±). Black has to allow his pawn structure to be damaged, otherwise the Nd5 is
a monster: 19...fxe6 20.hxg6 hxg6 21.Ne3±) 19.Qxd5 (Black hopes to stabilize the queenside) 19...b4 20.c4 Qc7 21.O-O Rb6 22.b3. We get this type of position more often in the Sveshnikov (which is the reason I selected this game) and it would be a mistake to evaluate this as drawish due to the opposite-coloured bishops. White has a clear advantage while Black has no counterplay: 22...Rd8. Wesley So is an excellent technical player but here he committed an unusual (for him) mistake. White had to continue to slowly improve his position when Black would be under long-term pressure struggling for a draw. For example, 23.Rad1. White has many plans here: triple on the d-file or think about pushing the f4-pawn. I am not sure if White's advantage is as large as your engine will evaluate (around +1) but Black definitely faces a long-term struggle for a draw. In a hurry to improve his position, So played 23.a4? bxa3 and now Black had a target (the b3-pawn) and the position was equal! 24.hxg6 hxg6 25.Rxa3 Qc5 (the queen trade leads to a drawish endgame) 26.Rfa1 Qxd5 27.cxd5 Bh6 and a draw was soon agreed in So-Carlsen, Stavanger 2019.
12.Nc2 Rb8
Anand goes for the main move (today as well as at the time). Vishy probably had the ensuing exchange sacrifice in mind already. Was he inspired by the Kasparov-Shirov game that he obviously knew? It's not easy to say, as the exchange sacrifice - based on light-square domination - Vishy is about to execute had already been tried in a lesser-known game from grandmaster practice.
13.a4
In another high-level game thirteen years later, White was definitely inspired by this game from Anand! Let's take a look at the critical moment: 13.Be2 O-O 14.O-O Kh8
15.Bg4 Bb7 16.Ncb4 Nxb4 17.cxb4 g6 18.a4 bxa4 19.Rxa4 Bc6 and now White sort
of copied Anand's idea with 20.Be2 (if White does it in a slightly different way with
20.Rxa6 Bb5 21.Be2 Bxa6 22.Bxa6, Black also, just like in the game, gets good
counterplay after 22...f5) 20...Bxa4 21.Qxa4. If we compare this position to our main game (see comment after the move 19...Qe8 - Black plays 19...g6 instead) we see that Giri is two tempi down compared to Anand (actually better compared to the stem game Barua-Lalic) as Black's pawn is already on g6, Black is to move and the pawn on a6 has not yet been taken! Black has comfortable play here with 21...f5! 22.exf5 Rxf5. Probably, Magnus had already calculated the coming tactical motif. It should be mentioned that a draw would have been enough for Carlsen to win the tournament, so he was not ambitious (Black could have shown ambition by playing 22...gxf5!?): 23.Bd3 Rf8 24.Qxa6
24...Bd2! 25.Qc4 (25.b5?! Ba5 leads to Black's advantage) 25...Qc8 26.Qe4 and
now comes the tactical solution Magnus had probably calculated when playing
22...Rxf5: 26...Bxb4 27.Nxb4 Rf4 28.Qc6 end it all ended peacefully in a drawn
endgame: 28...Rfxb4 29.Qxd6 Qf8 30.Qxe5+ 1⁄2-1⁄2 Giri-Carlsen, Wijk aan Zee 2019.
13...bxa4 14.Ncb4
14...Bd7
Main theory nowadays is 14...Nxb4, the starting point of the theoretical discussion being 15.cxb4 O-O 16.Rxa4 a5! when we have many top-level games; the current assessment seems to be 'a dynamic balance'.
15.Bxa6 Nxb4 16.cxb4 O-O 17.O-O Bc6
Black could have stopped White's exchange sac by playing 17...Qe8 but then White has an advantage after the simple 18.b3 axb3 19.Qxb3. White has light-square domination, a passed b-pawn and control of the a-file; Black has no real counterplay. Now Vishy goes for a positional exchange sac that had already been seen in grandmaster practice some years earlier, so it's quite possible that Anand knew that game:
18.Rxa4! Bxa4 19.Qxa4
Compare this position to (the same sacrifice idea in) Giri-Carlsen, in the comment after 13.a4 (White playing 13.Be2). Well, it cannot really be compared, because in that game Black had played three more moves: ...Kh8, ...g6, ...f5, and also his pawn on a6 is still alive! Probably guided by the logic 'I am material up - a queen trade makes sense' Loek went for that:
19...Qe8
Black struggles to create counterplay here anyway, so keeping the queens on did not equalize either: 19...Kh8 20.Bb5! (20.b5 Qd7 21.Qc4 f5 was about equal in Ragger- Markos, Austria tt 2007) 20...f5 (20...g6 does not bring Black the counterplay he is hoping for after 21.Bc6 f5 22.b5 fxe4 23.Qxe4) 21.exf5 Rxf5 22.Bc6. Now, best for Black is probably to go for a pawn sacrifice: 22...e4 23.b5 e3 24.fxe3 ... ... assuming he finds the brilliant 24...Qf6!, but White still has some advantage after
25.Rxf5 Qxf5 26.h4.
The stem game went 19...g6 20.Qc6. Now Black went for the typical bishop transfer to b6: 20...Bd2 21.b5 Ba5 22.Bb7 f6 (including the Rf8 in the game) 23.b4 Bb6
24.Nxb6 Rf7.
The game Barua-Lalic, Ubeda 1998, saw a 'clean-up' into a drawn endgame after
25.Rd1 Rfxb7 26.Rxd6 Qxd6 27.Qxd6 Rxb6=. White's play can be improved with
25.Qc4! and after 25...Rbxb7 26.Nd5 Black struggles for a draw.
20.Qxe8 Rfxe8 21.b5
We have a type of position White is happy to get. Yes, the queens are off, but the light-squares domination from the middlegame still persists. White's plan is relatively easy: push the pawn to b7, then Nd5-b4-c6 (get your exchange back) and win a superior endgame. Black urgently needs counterplay, which is difficult to find. Van Wely goes for the most logical - and typically Sveshnikov - counterplay idea:
21...f5 22.b6
Vishy continues on his path and keeps the position closed. It is doubtful if Black gets enough counterplay after 22.exf5 e4 23.b6.
22...fxe4
White stands better, but how much better isn't easy to tell. Vishy comes up with an interesting pawn sac:
23.h4!?
With a limited number of pieces, White sacrifices a pawn to penetrate the c-file. The most logical alternative for White looks to be 23.Re1 when Black needs to improve his king: 23...Kf7 24.Rxe4. analysis diagram Black's position is difficult to defend, but the engine always has ideas: 24...Rf8! (the arguably more logical 24...Bd8 25.Rb4 Ke6 loses to 26.Bc4 Rf8 27.b7. White wants to play simply Rb5, Nb4, Na6 and Black cannot stop this: 27...Kd7 28.Bb5+ Ke6
29.Bc6 followed by Rb5, Nb4, Na6). Now White needs to spend a move to drive
Black's bishop away: 25.h4 (25.Rb4 Bd2) 25...Bd8 26.Rb4 Ke6 and things are not the same as in the comment to 24...Bd8: 27.Bc4 Kd7 28.Bb5+. analysis diagram Here Black has the defensive resource 28...Kc8!! 29.Rc4+ (it's never too late to do something stupid: 29.Bc6?? Bxb6) 29...Kb7 30.Bc6+ Kc8. analysis diagram Strangely, White does not have a killer check here and has to go for 31.b7+ Rxb7
32.Bxb7+ Kxb7 with (still) some advantage, but Black has reasonable chances to
survive.
23...Bd2?
For better or worse, the pawn had to be taken! 23...Bxh4!. The c-file penetration is less decisive than it looks: 24.Rc1 Rf8 25.g3 Bg5 26.Rc6 analysis diagram
26...Kf7! with approximate equality after 27.Bc4 Kg6 (or 27...h5) 28.Rxd6+ Kf5.
24.b7 Kf7 25.Rd1 Bh6 26.Nb4 Ke7 27.Nd5+ Kf7 28.g4 Bf4
29.Re1?
Logical but not precise. Apparently, it was better not to force matters as after 29.Kg2 Black runs out of useful moves while 29...Rf8 loses to 30.Bc4 Ke8 (30...Rxb7 31.Nxf4+ Ke8 32.Ne6)
31.Bb5+ Kd8.
analysis diagram Now White reminds Black of his weak king with 32.Ra1! and gets a winning advantage, e.g. 32...Rf7 33.Ra6
29...g5!
A strong move, keeping Black in the game! He could also have chosen a different move-order: 29...Red8 30.Rxe4 Rd7 31.Rb4 g5! (the immediate 31...Ke6 does not work that well after 32.Rb5 g5 33.Nb4) 32.h5 Ke6 analysis diagram
33.Rb5 (White has no deadly discovered check after 33.Bc4 Bd2) and we see why it
was good to protect the bishop on f4: 33...e4".
30.Re2
White renews the idea of the c-file penetration. After the (perhaps most logical)
30.h5 Black holds with 30...Red8! 31.Rd1 (31.Nb4?? Bd2; 31.Rxe4 Ke6) 31...Rd7=;
if 30.Rxe4, Black again eliminates the b-pawn with 30...Red8! 31.Rc4 Rd7=.
30...Red8?
Van Wely (again) refrains from pawn-grabbing and this proves to be the decisive mistake. Normally Loek loves to take material!
30...gxh4! had to be played. The advanced h-pawn helps Black to create counterplay
and probably this will save the game! A logical run of play can be 31.Rc2 h3 32.Kh1 h2 33.Nb4. analysis diagram Black's situation looks hopeless but thanks to his advanced h-pawn he can save the game: 33...h5! 34.Nc6 and now another hidden resource: 34...Ra8! 35.bxa8Q Rxa8
36.Nb4 hxg4 and it will probably end in a draw; Black has enough pawns for the
piece.
31.Nb4
Now White is easily winning and Anand brings it home with a steady hand.
31...d5 32.Nc6
The simple threat is 33.Nxd8 Rxd8 34.Rc2 with Rc8 to follow, so 30...Red8? proves to be a loss of two tempi.
32...Rg8 33.Nxb8 Rxb8
34.h5!
In essence, creating another passed pawn, as Black's h-pawn is going to fall.
34...Ke7 35.Kf1 d4 36.Rc2 e3 37.fxe3
Sadly for Black, he has to take with the pawn:
37...dxe3 38.Rc7+ Kf6
39.Rxh7
White's passed pawns are impossible to stop.
39...e4 40.Bc4 Rd8 41.Rf7+ Ke5 42.Rd7
And Black resigned. The second rank rook lift Game 24 Ruslan Ponomariov 2700 Vladimir Kramnik 2754 Wijk aan Zee 2005
1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.d4 cxd4 4.Nxd4 Nf6 5.Nc3 e5 6.Ndb5 d6 7.Bg5 a6 8.Na3 b5
9.Nd5 Be7 10.Bxf6 Bxf6 11.c3 Bg5 12.Nc2
12...O-O
Magnus entered this line twice as Black. First he lost to Peter Leko, but a year later (also at Linares) he repeated it vs Grischuk: 12...Ne7 13.h4 Bh6 14.a4 bxa4 15.Ncb4 O-O with a nice positional advantage for White: 16.Qxa4 Nxd5 17.Nxd5 a5 (after
17...Kh8, most probably Magnus did not like 18.Qa5) 18.Bb5.
White's advantage is small, but normally we have play for two results here. White will create a passed b-pawn, Black's Bh6 is controling many 'empty squares' while White dominates the light squares. 18...Be6 19.Bc6 Rb8. It's time for White to create a passed pawn: 20.b4 Bxd5 21.Bxd5 axb4 22.cxb4 (practically, White is a pawn up as Black's d6-pawn is not worth much, but Black should be able to hold) 22...Qb6
23.Rb1 (one year later, interestingly enough Grischuk went for a pawn sacrifice here
with 23.O-O Qxb4 24.Qd7. White does not have enough pieces to build on his light- square pressure and the game Grischuk-Carlsen, Linares 2009, was soon drawn)
23...Kh8 (the coffeehouse-type sacrifice 23...Bd2+? does not work for Black after
the simple 24.Kxd2 Qxf2+ 25.Kd3 Qxg2 26.Rhe1) 24.O-O. After losing against Leko, Magnus was ready to play this position again (vs Grischuk), and it makes me wonder what Magnus had in mind. 24...f5 (perhaps here Magnus intended to improve his bishop with the typical Sveshnikov maneuvre
24...Bd2 25.b5 Bc3 with ...Bd4 to follow, when it looks difficult for White to
improve his position) 25.Qa5 (keeping the queens on with 25.b5 offers White good prospects.) 25...fxe4 26.Qxb6 Rxb6 27.Rb3 and thanks to his b-pawn White has an advantage in this ending. Black is probably closer to a draw then White is to a win, nevertheless White won in Leko-Carlsen, Morelia/Linares 2008.
13.a4 bxa4 14.Rxa4 a5 15.Bc4 Rb8
This is the position of our interest. Ponomariov comes up with an interesting plan here! White has many pawns on his second rank, nevertheless Pono plans to swing his Ra4 to the kingside and obtain a deadly attack! Later, white players improved the move-order, however to my knowledge the plan belongs to Pono and this is the stem game!
16.Ra2!?
Nine years later Anish Giri copied Ponomariov's plan and crushed Alexei Shirov in their friendly match (it pays off to do some research!). Let's see this game. This is also the best move-order for White: 16.b3! Kh8 17.Nce3 g6 (If Black goes for 17...Bxe3 18.Nxe3 Ne7, White has an advantage after 19.O-O analysis diagram as Black does not have the convenient counterplay idea 19...f5 here, e.g. 20.exf5 Nxf5 21.Nxf5 (Black will lose his a5-pawn for no compensation) 21...Rxf5 /(21...Bxf5) 22.Qd5±.) Now Anish goes for the plan Pono devised in our stem game: 18.h4!. White sacrifices his h-pawn so as to open the h-file and gain time to push g3, followed by f4, clearing the second rank for the rook transfer Ra4-a2-h2! 18...Bxh4 (if Black does not accept the sacrifice, White has an easy advantage) 19.g3 Bg5 (19...Bf6
20.Ra2 transposes to our main game Ponomariov-Kramnik). Anish now copies
Pono's plan: 20.f4! exf4 21.gxf4 Bh4+ (this check is logical; Black hopes to gain time. After 21...Bf6 White gets a deadly attack with 22.Ra2! Re8 23.Rah2!). Where to go with the white king? A) It took white players some time to understand the necessity of keeping the second rank free for the Ra4-a2-h2 rook swing! After 22.Kd2, the king stands in the way of the rook transfer and Black has a good game after 22...Ne7! as for example in Topalov-Leko, Linares 2005; B) 22.Kf1!. Now Black wants to open the f-file to take advantage of White's king being placed on f1: 22...f5 (22...Ne7 now loses to the rook swing 23.Ra2! with Rah2 to follow and a crushing attack) 23.Ra2! (consistent and strong) 23...fxe4 (23...g5
24.Rah2 fxe4 25.Qh5 Rb7 26.Ke2 transposes to the game) 24.Rah2 g5. White will
need to move his king away from the f-file pin in order to threaten fxg5, but he needs to activate his queen first. I do not know how far Giri's opening preparation went, but I do know Anish played a perfect game: 25.Qh5! B1) 25...Ne5 does not help Black, as after 26.Ke2 Nxc4 27.fxg5! he does not have real counterplay, e.g. 27...Rxb3 28.Rxh4 and White's king is perfectly safe in the centre: 28...Rb2+ 29.Ke1 Rb1+ 30.Nd1 Bf5 31.g6 (Black cannot avoid material loss)
31...Rb7 32.Rf4 Bxg6 (32...Qd7 loses to the prosaic 33.Rhf1 and Bf5 falls, while
32...Be6 lands Black in a lost endgame after 33.Rxf8+ Qxf8 34.Qxh7+! Rxh7
35.Rxh7+ Kg8 36.Ne7++-) 33.Rxf8+ Qxf8 34.Qxg6 White was a sound piece up
and soon won in Korneev-Huerga Leache, Linares 2015; B2) 25...Rb7 26.Ke2. The triumph of White's strategy! His king is perfectly safe in the centre while Black needs to start worrying about fxg5, forcing the Bh4 to move and opening the h-file: 26...Be6 27.Qh6 Bg8 (more stubborn was 27...Bxd5, however after 28.Nxd5 - 28.Bxd5 leads to unclear consequences after 28...Rxf4! 29.Bxc6 Rxb3 as White is reminded that his king is now 'always safe' - 28...Rff7 29.Qe6 White has light-square domination plus an attack along the h-file, and should win)
28.Rg2! (White is playing with great accuracy; 28.Ng2??, hoping to clear the h-file,
is a blunder and loses to 28...Ne7; and moving the other rook was not precise as after
28.Rg1 Bxd5 29.Nxd5 Ne7 30.Rxg5 Nxd5 31.Rxd5 Black has the unpleasant tempo
move 31...Bg3!) 28...Rbf7 (arguably most stubborn was 28...Bxd5 29.Nxd5 Ne7, but ultimately it would probably not change the outcome as after 30.Rxg5 Nxd5 31.Rxd5 Bf6 - 31...Bg3? does not gain a tempo now and loses to 32.Rdh5 Qe7 33.Qg6 Bxf4
34.Rf5! - 32.Rdh5, White has a strong attack with the opposite-coloured bishops.
The attacking side usually wins in such situations!). Anish now demonstrates accuracy in the execution: 29.Rxh4! gxh4 30.Nf5 h3
31.Nh4!. Mate in one is always a powerful threat! Black is forced to part with his
queen: 31...Qxh4 32.Rxg8+ Rxg8 33.Qxh4 Rg2+ 34.Kf1. White has a sizeable material advantage, while his attack is far from over. Black will suffer further material losses: 34...Rh2 35.Ne3 Rg7 36.Qf6 Rh1+ 37.Kf2 Rh2+ 38.Ke1 (if Black keeps checking, White's king goes all the way to a3) 38...Rh1+ 39.Kd2 Rh2+
40.Kc1 Ne7
41.Nf5!, concluding the game. Out of inertia Black played a few more moves:
41...Rhg2 42.Nxg7 Rxg7 43.Qf8+ Ng8 44.Bxg8 Rxg8 45.Qf6+ Rg7 46.Qh4 1-0
Giri-Shirov, Hoogeveen 2014.
16...Kh8 17.Nce3
17...g6
The reason why 16.b3! is a better move-order than 16.Ra2 is the following line:
17...Bxe3! 18.Nxe3 Ne7 and now after 19.b3 white king is still on e1 and Black
equalizes with 19...f5, as for example in Karjakin-Topalov, Wijk aan Zee 2006. Now Ruslan goes for his master plan!
18.h4!
Interestingly, a couple of months later Anand did not follow White's bold plan and went for the relatively timid 18.O-O, giving Black a good game after 18...f5 in Anand-Kasparov, Linares 2005.
18...Bxh4
Again Black is not forced to accept the sacrifice but White has an easy advantage' after 18...Bxe3 19.Nxe3.
19.g3
19...Bf6
Facing a novel plan, Kramnik understood the danger and did not want to give White another tempo. A couple of months later, Vladimir utilizes Ruslan's idea on the White side and scored an easy win! Van Wely went for 19...Bg5 and Vladimir followed up on Pono's idea with 20.f4 exf4 21.gxf4 Bh4+ 22.Kf1 f5. With his pawn still on b2, White wants to take the maximum out of the position:
23.b4! (23.b3 transposes to Giri-Shirov). Now Black also needed to worry about the
move b5, harassing his knight at an unfortunate moment: 23...fxe4 24.Rah2 g5. It being a rapid game, White does not play in the most precise way. The most accurate was to immediately remove White's king from the pin on the f-file:
25.Ke2!+- (the game itself went 25.b5 Ne5 and now Black had some counterplay.
White eventually won in Kramnik-Van Wely, Monaco 2005). At a desirable moment White will take fxg5, unleashing the power of his doubled rooks. Black does not have a suitable defense, e.g. 25...Rf7 (protecting the h7-pwn with 25...Rb7 loses to
26.b5 and Black has no good answer; if 25...axb4, White comes first with 26.fxg5)
26.b5! and again Black does not have a good response.
20.b3
The second rank is almost cleared. White only has to push the f-pawn and the Ra2 will swing to the kingside with devastating power!
20...Bg7
Kramnik hopes his bishop will offer his king Dragon-like protection while creating counterplay on the e-file. Your computer engine will suggest 20...Kg7 21.f4 h5 - this looks passive and will probably not save Black.
21.f4 exf4 22.gxf4 Re8
Here Ponomariov missed an opportunity to create a masterpiece.
23.Qf3?
The best move was the bold and direct 23.Rah2!. Probably, Ruslan found it difficult to calculate the consequences of 23...Rxe4 (after 23...h6 24.Qf3 White has a crushing attack without any risk) 24.Rxh7+ Kg8 25.Qf3 Rxc4!. analysis diagram The position indeed looks complicated, and it's easy to understand that White did not go for this. He would have needed to see a beautiful mating net woven with 26.f5!! and Black does not have a good response as 26...Ne5 runs into 27.Rxg7+! Kxg7
28.f6+ Kg8 29.Rh8+! Kxh8 30.Qh1+ Kg8 31.Qh6 Qf8 32.Ne7+ Qxe7 33.Qg7#.
23...Kg8
A logical prophylactic move. Black does not want his h-pawn to be taken with check. The position is very complicated. Black's Bg7 is now protecting its king in 'Dragon fashion' and the silicon brain flashes with (some) zero-point-zero lines. To be honest, I am surprised that neither of the players cracked here and this crazy game ended in a draw!
24.Rah2 h5
Black's best defense was 24...Ne7! when the game may continue 25.Rxh7 Nxd5
26.Nxd5 (26.Bxd5 Qf6 looks fine for Black; again, similar to the Dragon Variation,
the dark-squared bishop is protecting its king and there is no mate) 26...Bf5. analysis diagram The white queen is urgently needed on the h-file: 27.Qf2! Rxe4+ 28.Kf1 Rxc4
29.Qh2 and most probably this mess now comes to a peaceful conclusion: 29...f6
30.Rh8+ Bxh8 31.Qxh8+ Kf7 32.Qh7+! Ke6 33.bxc4 Rb1+ 34.Kf2 Rxh1 35.Nc7+
Qxc7 36.Qxc7 Rh4 with equality.
25.Rxh5!?
Logical and principled! It is actually surprising that Black's defensive resources are sufficient. Stockfish thinks White needed to be a little more patient and would have had excellent attacking chances after 25.O-O or 25.Qg2.
25...gxh5 26.Qxh5
With his pawn defences removed, Black's king needs more defenders:
26...Re6! 27.Qh7+ Kf8 28.Rg1 Rg6 29.Rxg6 fxg6
The bishop is a strong defender; White cannot force mate by using his light-square domination only.
30.f5
If 30.Nf6, 30...Ne7! defends.
30...Qg5!
The active queen provides Black with counterplay.
31.Nf4! Ne7 32.Nxg6+ Ke8
White is a full rook down and needs to keep his attack going.
33.Nd5! Qg1+ 34.Kd2 Qg5+ 35.Ke1
Understanding there is no mate (and being a rook up), Vlad gets ambitious!
35...Bf6! 36.Ngxe7! Bxe7
37.Qh8+
Being a rook down, Ponomariov (very understandably and humanly!) looks for the most direct moves. I was very surprised that my engine considered White's domination enough compensation for the rook deficit and gave zeros after a 'pass move' like 37.Ke2.
37...Kd7 38.f6 Qg3+ 39.Ke2 Qg2+ 40.Ke3 Qg3+ 41.Ke2
Black still had winning hopes:
41...Qg4+ 42.Kf2
42.Ke3 should also have led to equality.
42...Bd8
Being a rook down, it is never easy to find quiet moves:
43.Bf1! Kc6
We could have had a spectacular finish with 43...Qxe4 44.Bg2 Qf5+ 45.Kg1 Bb7 (pinning the bishop with 45...Qg5?? leads to a disaster after 46.f7) 46.Bh3 and it peters out into a draw: 46...Bb6+ 47.Nxb6+ Kc6 48.Qxb8 Qxh3 49.Nc4 Qg3+=.
44.Qxd8
And Black decided to call it a day:
44...Qh4+ 45.Kg1 Qg3+ 1⁄2-1⁄2
I also played in this tournament, but it escaped my attention what an amazing game this was!! Chapter 5 French Defence: Winawer Variation The French is a strategically complex opening, with different (often unrelated) pawn structures, rich with ideas - enough material for a separate book. With limited space, I had to make a choice and you will notice that all my examples feature pawn structures from the Winawer Variation. Why did I choose these? Well, when I was in my 'formative years' (a junior player), I struggled to understand these Winawer type positions. I was approximately 2400 Elo, and I had trouble understanding that the positions that looked so great for White to me, were not so clear at all. Needless to say, computer programs did not exist, making my job harder. Per definition, White has more space in the centre and on the kingside, the pair of bishops, nice development, while Black has less space and a 'stupid' light-squared bishop locked in behind its own pawns. The doubled c-pawns White allows to grab the bishop pair look more like an 'academic weakness'. I assume that many of the readers will struggle to understand these complex positions just like I did forty years ago! That's why the Winawer pawn structures were my 'French choice' for this book. I have selected twelve games that, I think, illustrate well the strategic ideas for both sides in these complex positions. The weakness on e6 In the diagram, we have a typical position that is favourable for White. Black has traded his 'stupid French bishop' and even has potential c-file pressure, but he has one problem: the weakness on e6! White's knight is great on f4, keeping Black busy defending weak the e6-pawn, while White also has great prospects of a kingside attack. The first game I have selected is an excellent instructive example, Kasparov's play is logical, and his plans are relatively easy to replicate. Game 25 Garry Kasparov 2795 Nigel Short 2690 Novgorod 1997
1.e4 e6 2.d4 d5 3.Nc3 Bb4 4.e5 c5 5.a3 Bxc3+ 6.bxc3 Qc7 7.Qg4 f5
A quite consequential decision (though taken by many top players, World Champion Botvinnik included). Black creates a permanent weakness on e6 for himself.
8.Qg3
8...cxd4
Fixing the central pawn structure. The more dynamic 8...Ne7 9.Qxg7 Rg8 10.Qxh7 cxd4 was tried in several Tal-Botvinnik games in the 1960 and 1961 World Championship matches. The basic problem for Black is that the modern treatment
11.Ne2!, as in Anand-Hansen, Middelfart 2003, gives White a strong initiative.
9.cxd4 Ne7
The greedy 9...Qxc2? is not a good idea here, as White can develop quickly and harmoniously while Black has to play some awkward moves: 10.Bd2 Qc7 11.Rc1 Nc6 12.Bb5. Now, in order to develop, Black has to go for 12...Kf7 and after 13.Ne2 Nge7 14.h4 Bd7 15.h5 h6 White has an initiative worth considerably more than the sacrificed pawn. Though White doesn't have an 'instant killer', Black cannot coordinate his pieces and in computer language this position is close to plus two.
10.Bd2 O-O
11.Bd3
Black is likely to play ...b6 followed by ...Ba6, trading off his bad bishop, while White (in this game and a number of others on top level) keeps his bishop on d2. It looks to me that White can win a tempo on Kasparov's play if he takes Bxa6 in 'one go' by playing 11.c3!? here. Black still has to continue his basic plan with 11...b6 and now White seeems to have a better version of the game after 12.h4 Ba6 13.Bxa6 (or 13.Nh3 Bxf1 14.Kxf1; or 13.h5) 13...Nxa6 14.Nh3.
11...b6 12.Ne2 Ba6
The typical French trade. Black solves the problem of his bad bishop; however, he will need one piece to defend the e6-weakness.
13.Nf4
White now gets long-term strategic pressure. 13.Bb4 looks active (and has worked well for White in practice), but it is not as good as it seems: 13...Bxd3 14.cxd3 Nbc6
15.Bd6 Qd7 16.O-O.
analysis diagram A) Black now unpinned his knight while also placing his rook on an open file with
16...Rfc8?!. This looks logical but is not best: 17.h4 Ng6 18.h5 Nh8 19.h6 g6.
Black's king is weak and White senses an opportunity: 20.Nf4! Nxd4 21.Ra2 Qb7. Now White would like to attack the Nd4 but first wants to prevent the retreat to b5:
22.a4! (22.Qe3 leads to unclear play: 22...Nb5 23.Nxe6 Re8 24.a4 d4! 25.Qe1 Nxd6
26.exd6 Qd7 27.Re2 Qxd6 with complications) 22...Rc6 23.Qe3! Nc2 24.Rxc2!
Rxc2 25.Nxe6. Black's king is weak and White has a winning attack. 25...Nf7
26.Nd4 Ra2
27.Nxf5! Nxd6 28.exd6! gxf5 29.Qg5+ Kf8. The pawn defences in front of Black's
king have been removed and White's rook joins the attack, putting game to an end:
30.Re1 Qf7 31.Re7 1-0 Diez del Corral-Portisch, Buenos Aires 1978;
B) Black could have exploited the fact that White's d4-pawn is shaky and taken the initiative with 16...f4! and Black is better, e.g. 17.Qg4 (or 17.Qf3 Rf7) 17...f3
18.gxf3 Rf7.
13...Qd7 14.h4
White can (again) place his bishop on the a3-f8 diagonal with 14.Bb4, however the outcome is not clear after 14...Rc8 followed by ...Bxd3 and ...Nbc6. It is perhaps good to mention that a number of strong players blundered here with
14...Bxd3? when White gets a large advantage after 15.Nh5!. Now, Black already
struggles to find moves to stay in the game: 15...Ng6 16.Bxf8 Ba6 17.Bxg7 Qa4! (after 17...Qb5 18.O-O-O Black had no compensation and White easily won in Brkic- Nikolic, Croatia tt 2008) 18.O-O-O Be2 19.Nf4 Bxd1 20.Rxd1 Nxf4 21.Qxf4 Qxa3+
22.Kd2 Nd7!. Black has prevented immediate annihilation, but White is clearly
better after 23.Bf6.
14...Bxd3 15.Qxd3
This is the position of our interest, and a good moment to take stock to trying to understand this type of position. Quite a number of top players (former World Champion Botvinnik included) have repeatedly picked the Black side here. Black has traded the 'right bishops' and has also fixed the pawn structure for the time being, as White has no immediate attack and no immediate pawn breaks. Black also has potential pressure on the c-file and an outpost on c4. What can be Black's problem? The pawn on e6 is a permanent weakness, and it is targeted by White's Nf4. Black cannot trade off this knight unless White voluntarily agrees to it. White will push his h-pawn, at least to h5 or maybe all the way to h6. He also has the potential g-pawn push (f3 followed by g4) and has an attack along the g-file, as happened in this game. Black's c4-outpost and c-file 'pressure' are of academic value. White has long-term pressure here, and potentially a swift attack as it is easy for Black to go wrong!
15...Nbc6
Some years later, Nigel Short tried to improve by first bringing his rook to the c4- outpost: 15...Rc8. His opponent of course knew the current game and copy-catted Kasparov's play: 16.Rh3! Rc4 (Black's 'active' rook on c4 doesn't have any value)
17.Rg3 Nbc6 18.c3 Rf8. Just like Garry, White now first took the time to improve
his king's position: 19.Kf1 Rf7 20.Kg1 Na5 21.a4 Qc6 22.Ra3 Kf8. Now is the time to bring the queen to the kingside (just like Garry): 23.Qb1! Nb7. Here, Black 'equalized' with a draw offer and the draw was agreed in Teran Alvarez-Short, Lanzarote 2003. In reality, if he had not been impressed by his opponent's high Elo rating, White could have continued like Kasparov with 24.Qd1 and built up a risk-free kingside attack. Stockfish 15 at a decent depth evaluates it as more than plus two! Kasparov goes for the immediate rook lift:
16.Rh3
16.h5 followed by Rh3 was an alternative.
16...Rac8
16...Ng6 most probably transposes into the same type position as in the game as
White retreats with 17.Ne2 followed by 18.h5.
17.Rg3 Rf7
A classic game by Botvinnik also mirrors the strategic decisions players have to take in this type of position, so let's have a look: 17...Kh8 18.h5 A) If Black is not in the mood to play ...h6, he can choose to transfer his knight to f7 with 18...Nd8 19.Kf1 (in case of 19.h6 g6 20.Kf1 Nf7 Black controls the entry points) 19...Nf7. analysis diagram White is better here as Black does not have any active counterplay. White will have to combine kingside threats with opening up the queenside to penetrate there; B) Reshevsky chose to determine the kingside pawn structure: 18...Rf7 19.h6 g6
20.Rc1 Rff8 21.Ne2! (preparing Bd2-g5-f6) 21...Nb8 22.Kf1 Rc4 23.Kg1 Nbc6
24.Bg5! Ng8 25.Re1 Qf7 26.c3 Na5 27.Nf4 Rc6.
B1) Probably in time pressure (which Reshevsky was known for), White gets impatient: 28.Bf6+? Nxf6 29.exf6 Nc4 (White can no longer play Rge3 and simply loses a pawn for nothing) 30.Qb1 (30.Qe2 Qxf6 31.Nxe6?? drops a piece to the simple 31...Re8) 30...Qxf6. Black is now a pawn up with an excellent position and won easily in Reshevsky-Botvinnik, The Hague/Moscow 1948; B2) The idea of Bf6+ followed by Nf4-h3-g5 needed to be prepared: 28.Rge3! Nc4
29.R3e2 Ne7 (29...Nxa3?? loses to 30.Bf6+! Nxf6 31.exf6 Re8 32.Nxd5) 30.Bf6+
Kg8. Now White improves his knight with 31.Nh3! Rfc8 32.Ng5 Qe8 33.a4 and Black has no active play. White will combine opening up the queenside with f3 and g4 (opening up the kingside). However, bear in mind that though your computer engine will give a clear advantage to White (considerably more than plus one!), White will need a precise execution to gain the full point.
18.h5
In the next couple of moves, Black has to decide whether to push ...h6 or not and White whether to push h6 himself (as Black will give him a couple of opportunities). It seems like Kasparov and Short mutually established ...h6 to be weakening for Black. Such pawn structure decisions are hard to take as there are no direct variations supporting them. Still, I think Black had to play 18...h6 here.
18...Nd8 19.c3 Rf8
Again, 19...h6 came into consideration.
20.Kf1 Rc4 21.Kg1 Nf7 22.a4 Rfc8
And again, 22...h6 was to be considered. Kasparov now skilfully improves his queen, generating different ideas:
23.Qb1!
Black has a passive position; however, the idea of holding on by 'sitting on his hands' will not work:
23...Nc6?
23...h6 was needed, though now White combines kingside pressure with the opening
of the queenside: 24.Qb5! (please note that a trade of the type 24.Ng6? Nxg6
25.Rxg6 is a terrible strategic mistake here, as White loses the crucial pressure on e6:
25...Nh8 26.Rg3 Nf7 and Black is doing well) 24...Qc6 25.Ra3 Kh7.
analysis diagram How can White improve here? Well, by opening up and penetrating the queenside:
26.Nd3! Qe8 (Black cannot say 'pass' as after for example 26...Kh8 White forces the
decision with 27.Nb2) 27.Qxe8 Rxe8 28.a5! b5 29.a6!. White's Rg3 now transfers to the queenside - Rg3-e3-e1-b1 - and Black has serious difficulties here.
24.Qd1
White could have considered 24.h6 g6 25.Nh5 Kh8 26.Nf6 as Black cannot remove the Nf6 with ...Ne7 and ...Ng8 due to 26...Qd8 27.Qb5! Ne7 28.a5!.
24...Ne7
Black now pays the price for not pushing ...h6. We are no longer just talking domination here, White gets a mating attack!
25.h6! g6
25...Nxh6?? loses a piece for nothing after the simple 26.Nh5 Ng4 27.f3 or 26...Ng6?
27.Bxh6+-.
26.Qh5!
Unable to stop White's threats, Black, understanding his position is lost anyway, grabs a pawn:
26...Rxa4
26...Kf8 runs into 27.Qh4 with 28. Qf6 to follow, and if 27...Ng8?, White wins with
28.Rxg6 hxg6 29.Nxg6+ Ke8 30.h7.
27.Rxa4
White had a pleasant alternative in 27.Re1 with the same winning attack as in the previous comment: 27...Kf8 28.Qh4 etc.
27...Qxa4
Probably feeling the job has been done, Kasparov now relaxes and does not execute in the best way:
28.Nxe6
A) The straightforward 28.Nxg6? hxg6 29.Rxg6+ Nxg6 30.Qxg6+ Kf8 31.h7 does not win as after 31...Qd1+ 32.Kh2 Qxd2 33.Qf6 Black has perpetual check with
33...Qf4+ 34.Kg1 Qc1+;
B) The most precise execution was the 'prophylactic attacking king move' 28.Kh2!. White now threatens 29. Nxg6 while, compared to 28. Nxg6 line, Black can no longer save himself by perpetual check, e.g.: B1) 28...Qd7 29.Nxg6 hxg6 30.Rxg6+ Nxg6 31.Qxg6+ Kf8 32.h7 Qd8 33.Bg5; B2) 28...Qc2 only delays the inevitable after 29.Be3 or the immediate 29.Qh4; B3) 28...Rc6 29.Nxg6 hxg6 30.Rxg6+ Nxg6 31.Qxg6+ Kf8 32.h7 (now Black does not have the saving check on d1) 32...Qd1 33.Bh6+ Ke7 34.Bg5+.
28...Qc2?
This loses on the spot. Interestingly, Black could have continued fighting with 28...Rc6! when White's next two moves are more or less forced: 29.Nf4 Kf8 30.Qe2 analysis diagram and now after 30...g5! yes, White does stand better but the issue is far from decided.
29.Qh4! f4 30.Bxf4 Nf5 31.Rxg6+
Black resigned as after 31...hxg6 White has various ways to win, the following line being convincing enough: 32.h7+ Kh8 33.Qf6+ Kxh7 (the only thing White needs to pay attention to is not to blunder into a perpetual check by ...Qd1+ and ...Qh5+)
34.Qxf7+ Kh8 and now White can go for mate: 35.Qf6+ (the simple 35.Qxg6 wins
as well) 35...Kh7 36.Ng5+ Kh6 37.Ne4+ Kh7 38.Qf7+ Kh8 39.Nf6 Ng7 40.Bh6. Kingside attack White is going to play for a kingside attack, while Black will push his pawns on the queenside, trying to create counterplay. This particular position is favourable for White because his knight on f4 is excellently placed, supporting a quick kingside attack. The same (pawn structure) position with a white knight on f3 would have had been rather unclear (as it will take White more time to start a kingside attack. I have selected two games emphasizing this point. The fixed central pawn chain Game 26 Sergey Karjakin 2778 Francisco Vallejo Pons 2697 Sao Paulo/Bilbao 2012
1.e4 e6 2.d4 d5 3.Nc3 Bb4 4.e5 c5 5.a3 Bxc3+ 6.bxc3 Ne7 7.Qg4
7...O-O
Another main, more theoretical line here is 7...cxd4 8.Qxg7 Rg8 9.Qxh7 Qc7. I will not analyse it in this book because there are too many theoretical ('computer prep') lines here. The sideline 7...Kf8 avoids direct threats; however, Black will need to lose time solving his king problem, as for example in Anand-Xiong, Wijk aan Zee 2020. The sideline 7...Nf5 is no longer played at top level, and probably for a good reason, see Stein-Petrosian, Moscow 1961 further on in this French chapter.
8.Bd3
Modern theory regards this as the main line here. 8.Nf3 used to be played at top level - see Mecking-Korchnoi, Wijk aan Zee 1978. Black is now at a crossroads; he has to decide on the type of pawn structure we are going to get.
8...Nbc6
This leads to a closed structure. The alternative 8...f5 9.exf6 Rxf6, resulting in a quite different pawn structure, is another often played line here - see Anand- Timman, Dortmund 1999.
9.Qh5!
Modern theory considers this the most precise move here.
9.Nf3 can still transpose into Mecking-Korchnoi (the move-order with 8.Nf3 Nbc6
9.Bd3).
9...Ng6
Seeing this position, I recall playing my first Dortmund super-tournament 34 years ago, walking along the tables and seeing a former Soviet champion, the famous grandmaster Lev Psakhis, getting massacred. Engines did not exist at the time... opening preparation was at a considerably lower level, and poor Lev played 9...h6?? when thunder struck at once with 10.Bxh6!. Black's position is already lost!
10...gxh6 11.Qxh6 Nf5 12.Bxf5 exf5 13.O-O-O f4 (or 13...c4 14.Nh3 Qe7 15.Nf4+-)
14.Nh3 (even more effective/brutal was 14.Rd3 Ne7
analysis diagram
15.Rg3+!! Ng6 16.Ne2) 14...Bf5 15.Nxf4 with a winning attack; White won after a
few more moves in Kindermann-Psakhis, Dortmund 1989. The kingside pawn structure is likely to change soon. White will soon capture Bxg6 when Black recaptures ...fxg6 so White positions himself for this change of structure.
10.Nf3
Modern theory considers 10.Nh3! to be the most precise, see Caruana-Shankland, Saint Louis 2016.
10...Qc7 11.Be3
Vallejo decides to force the mentioned pawn structure change.
11...c4
Black can opt for a different pawn structure with 11...Nce7!? 12.h4 Nf5 when the pawns are not fixed and the game is rather 'fluid'. We have an interesting game of Anand here. White's chances are related to a kingside attack, so the knight on f5 needs to be harassed: 13.g4! Nxe3 14.fxe3 cxd4. A critical moment! A) Vishy opts for the most logical continuation, but it's not the best: 15.cxd4 Qc3+!
16.Ke2 Bd7. White's exposed king should provide Black with enough counterplay
for a draw: 17.Rab1! (White eliminates Black's ...Bb5 while penetrating the b-file; if
17.Ng5 h6 18.Nxf7 Rxf7 19.Qxg6 Black forces a perpetual check with 19...Rf2+!
20.Kxf2 Qd2+ 21.Kg3 Qxe3+=) 17...Be8 18.Ng5 h6 19.Rxb7! Qc8! 20.Rhb1.
It looks as if Black will crumble under the mating attack, but the bad position of White's queen offers defensive resources: 20...Nxe5? (a crucial mistake. Black has the right idea - to save the game by trapping White's queen - but fails in the execution. He could have saved the game with 20...f5! 21.exf6 Rxf6. analysis diagram White's queen is trapped, so he has to be careful: 22.Nh7! Rf5! and here White has only one move to stay in the game!: 23.Qxh6! gxh6 24.gxf5 exf5 and it ends in perpetual check: 25.Nf6+ Kf8 26.Nh7+ Kg8 27.Nf6+=) 21.dxe5 f5. analysis diagram Now the queen-trapping idea does not work so well: 22.exf6! Rxf6 (22...Bxh5? runs into mate in two with 23.Bh7+ Kh8 24.fxg7#) 23.Nf7! Rxf7 (or 23...Bxf7 24.Qe5 with a winning advantage for White) 24.Rxf7 Bxf7 25.Qe5. With material equal, White has an attack plus domination, and he went on to win, Anand-Lputian, Moscow 2004; B) Precise was 15.O-O!. With his king in safety, White can focus on the attack:
15...f6 (Black gets mated in case of 15...dxe3 16.Ng5 h6 17.Bxg6 fxg6 18.Qxg6
hxg5 19.Rxf8+ Kxf8 20.Rf1+ Kg8 21.Qe8+ Kh7 22.Rf8) 16.cxd4 (White's central pawn structure is now compact, while his king is safe) 16...Bd7 17.Rf2! and Black is in bad shape. White wants to double his rooks or take on g6 and collect a pawn for free. 17...Be8? does not help as White simply builds up with 18.Raf1 and has a winning attack.
12.Bxg6 fxg6 13.Qg4
White's central pawn chain makes it difficult for Black to obtain immediate counterplay here, while White wants to regroup and start a pawn storm on the kingside. Vallejo now regroups well, slowing down White's pawn storm:
13...Qf7!
At first glance, doubling rooks on the f-file looks logical: 13...Bd7 14.h4 Rf5 15.Qh3 (White wants to push g4) 15...Raf8 and now Anand started an instructive manoeuvre: 16.Ng1! Qa5 17.Ne2 Qa4 18.Kd2. White wants to render Black's doubled rooks 'obsolete' with 19. f4 followed by g4, storming the kingside. 18...Rxf2 19.Bxf2 Rxf2 (hoping for counterplay, but Anand is not afraid of ghosts) 20.h5! Rxe2+ 21.Kxe2 Qxc2+ 22.Kf1 gxh5 23.Kg1 Qg6
24.Qxh5 and White soon won in Anand-Ramirez, Mallorca 2004.
14.Ng5 Qe8
The 'active' 14...Qf5? traps his own queen after 15.Qe2 with a close to winning advantage for White in Kasparov-Short, Munich 1994.
15.h4
An important moment. Vallejo skilfully regroups, not giving White a free hand for a kingside pawn storm:
15...Ne7!
In case of 15...Bd7 16.Qe2! White's pawn roll works to perfection. Now, 16...Ne7 comes too late: 17.g4! Qd8 18.Kd2 b5 19.h5 gxh5 20.Rxh5 h6 21.Rah1 and White had a winning attack in Almasi-Lputian, Kemer 2007.
16.a4!?
Karjakin decides to place his bishop on the a3-f8 diagonal. However, this will involve a pawn sacrifice. In case of 16.Qe2, trying to roll the pawns like Almasi did (see the above comment after 15...Bd7), Black has defensive resources: 16...h6 17.Nh3 analysis diagram
17...Nf5!. Now White has an interesting pawn sacrifice: 18.g4!? (18.Nf4 does not
seem to achieve much for White as after 18...Bd7, 19.g4?? blunders into 19...Nxh4
20.Rxh4 g5) 18...Nxh4 19.f4. However, Black seems to be holding: 19...Bd7 20.Ng1
Qe7 21.Qh2 g5 22.fxg5 analysis diagram
22...Rf3! 23.Kd2 Rxe3! 24.Qxh4 Re4 with probably a draw after 25.gxh6 Qxh4
26.Rxh4 gxh6.
16...a5!
Black fixes a target on a4, getting ready to attack it. White goes for his regular pawn roll plan.
17.Qe2 Bd7
17...h6 18.Nh3 Nf5 is risky for Black here as the white bishop transfers to the a3-f8
diagonal with 19.Bc1.
18.g4
Black defends his e6-pawn and is now ready to collect on a4.
18...Ra6
Black could have also opted for 18...h6 19.Nh3 Bxa4. This position is very sharp and difficult to evaluate; your engine will give zeros after 20.h5 gxh5 21.g5 hxg5
22.Bxg5 Nf5.
Karjakin continues his plan to place his bishop on the a3-f8 diagonal.
19.Bc1
An alternative was the typical pawn break 19.h5 h6 20.Nh3 gxh5 21.g5.
19...Bxa4!
White has an attack, Black has material. Also Black has ...b5 and counterplay with the ...b4 pawn push.
20.Ba3 h6 21.Nh3 b5
The most direct. Retreating the bishop by 21...Bd7 with ...b5 to follow was an alternative.
22.Bc5 Rc6 23.Bd6 Rf7
A razor-sharp position, and both players were probably under severe time pressure. The objective assessment is a 'dynamic balance'... well... yes, if computer engines are playing. In a game between humans, (serious) mistakes are bound to happen. I strongly recommend to test your calculation skills here (and in the ensuing positions) and compare the results with the silicon brain lines. There are many lines here, and I will give what I consider the most important ones. There is no time to waste and Karjakin goes for a typical pawn break in these structures:
24.h5 gxh5
24...g5 was the alternative. Now White should prepare f4: 25.O-O Nc8 26.Bc5 with
sharp play: 26...Rxc5 27.dxc5 Qf8 and the objective assessment will be 'dynamic balance' and 'fire on board', e.g. 28.f4 gxf4 29.Rf3
25.g5 Nf5 26.gxh6 Nxh6
26...g6 was the alternative.
Most likely running short of time, Karjakin followed the logic 'whatever happens, my rooks need to get connected' and played:
27.Kd2?
This should have cost him the game. The exchange sac 27.Rxa4? does not work: 27...bxa4 28.Qxh5 Rb6-+. White had to opt for 27.Qxh5! and after 27...Bxc2 28.Rg1, analysis diagram Black needs to stay calm and focus on his own chances: 28...b4! (28...Kh8 leads to an ending where White dominates after 29.Ng5! Rf8 30.Qxe8 Rxe8 31.Rxa5)
29.Qxh6! Rxd6! 30.exd6 b3 with hair-raising complications and 'easy zeros'
(achieved via different lines) for my friend Mr. Stockfish.
27...Rf5!
Defending the h5-pawn!
28.Rhg1
28...Rb6! 29.f3 b4!
Counterplay time!
30.Qe3 Nf7 31.Bc5 Rb7 32.Rg2
32...Qb5?
It's not easy to remain calm in such situations (and probably in severe time trouble) but Black needed to cold-bloodedly continue his plan: 32...b3! 33.Rag1 b2!
34.Rxg7+ Kh8.
analysis diagram Probably Vallejo could not assess this position and opted for the 'safer' 32...Qb5. In reality Black queens while White has just a few checks: A) 35.Ng5 might look dangerous but Black has two ways to refute it: 35...Rxg5 (the bold 35...Kxg7 also wins: 36.Nxf7+ Kxf7 37.Qh6 Qg8 38.Rxg8 Kxg8 39.Qxe6+ Rff7 and White runs out of checks 40.Qg6+ Rg7 41.Qe6+ Rbf7 42.Qb6 and now Black queens after 42...Bb3!) 36.R7xg5 Nxg5 37.Qxg5 and Black has only one winning move here, but it's pretty convincing: 37...Kh7!; B) 35.Nf4 b1Q! and Black wins: 36.Rxb1 Rxb1 37.Rg6 Kh7.
33.Rag1?
Precise was 33.cxb4! axb4 34.Rag1 and now Black needs to find a path to stay alive with 34...Nxe5! 35.dxe5 c3+ 36.Ke1 analysis diagram
36...b3!. Now White has to play for mate: 37.Qh6 Rxe5+ 38.Be3 (Black needs to
distract White) 38...Rxe3+! 39.Qxe3 b2 (White can't allow Black to have two queens) 40.Kf2 b1Q 41.Qxe6+ Kh8 42.Rxb1 Qc5+! 43.Kg3 Rxb1 and due to the weak black king White has enough compensation to hold the balance.
33...bxc3+?
He doesn't take his chance. Black could have won with 33...Nxe5! 34.dxe5 and now White would have regretted not having taken 33.cxb4!: 34...bxc3+! and Black wins as White's king is simply too exposed 35.Ke2 (or 35.Ke1 Qb1+) 35...Qb2 (35...Bxc2).
34.Ke2
34...Nxe5?
Now the same idea does not bring Black the same result. The game could have been saved with 34...Ng5! 35.Nxg5 Qb2 36.Rc1 Bxc2... analysis diagram ... and now we can get a 'science fiction' variation: 37.Ke1 Bd3 38.Rxb2! cxb2
39.Ba3! b1Q 40.Rxb1 Rxb1+ 41.Bc1 a4.
analysis diagram Black seems to be queening/winning, however his king is weak: 42.Nxe6! a3
43.Nxg7! Kxg7 44.Qh6+ and White saves the draw.
35.Qh6!
Due to the fact that Black played 33....bxc3?, Black now does not have 35...Nxf3 with check!
35...Rff7 36.Qxe6!
Black now defends best under the circumstances:
36...Ng4! 37.Ng5!
37...Qb2?
This blunders into checkmate, putting an immediate end to this wild game. Black could have struggled on with 37...Qxc5! 38.dxc5 Rbe7; however, White still has a winning advantage after 39.fxg4 Rxe6+ 40.Nxe6 Re7. analysis diagram Now the time control would have been reached, and Karjakin would probably have found 41.gxh5 Rxe6+ 42.Kd1 d4 (Black's king is badly placed here) 43.Rxg7+ Kh8
44.Rg8+ Kh7 45.R1g7+ Kh6 and some precision is still needed:
analysis diagram
46.Rg4! (not 46.Rg6+? Rxg6 47.Rxg6+ Kxh5 with a draw) 46...Kh7 (46...Kxh5
loses to 47.Rg3 Kh4 48.Rg1) 47.R8g7+ Kh6 (or 47...Kh8? 48.R7g6 Rxg6 49.hxg6 d3 50.Rxc4) 48.R7g6+ Rxg6 (48...Kxh5 49.Rxe6 Kxg4 50.Re4+) 49.hxg6 d3 and now White can have a bit of fun choosing between the prosaic 50.Rxc4 or the more entertaining 50.g7 Bxc2+ 51.Kc1 Bb3 52.g8N+! Kh5 53.Nf6+ Kh6 54.Ne4.
38.Qc8+ 1-0
The closed centre: White gets a 'perfect' attack Game 27 Fabiano Caruana 2796 Samuel Shankland 2656 Saint Louis ch-USA 2016 Perhaps it would be going too far to say that this game 'closed' the variation seen in Karjakin-Vallejo Pons but actually, in essence it did! Caruana regroups his pieces better and thereby gets a better/quicker attack. The mistakes Shankland made... well, it's not easy to say... could Sam have had played it differently? Yes. Could he at any point in time got something like equality? No. After this game (up to the moment of this writing) we no longer have top level games in this line. So, let's see.
1.e4 e6 2.d4 d5 3.Nc3 Bb4 4.e5 Ne7 5.a3 Bxc3+ 6.bxc3 c5 7.Qg4 O-O 8.Bd3 Nbc6
9.Qh5 Ng6
So far we are following Karjakin-Vallejo. White's chances are on the kingside. Caruana readies his attack much better than Karjakin:
10.Nh3!
What is point behind this knight development? Caruana (correctly) anticipates that soon, just like in Karjakin-Vallejo Pons, the transaction ...c4; Bxg6 fxg6 is going to happen and he wants to be able to place his knight on f4 and immediately start pushing his kingside pawns. White will win considerable time compared to Karjakin- Vallejo Pons. Karjakin took three moves to place his knight on h3 while Caruana needed only one, while the pawn structure and the situation were more or less the same. For 10.Nf3 see Karjakin-Vallejo Pons, Sao Paulo/Bilbao 2012 (previous game).
10...Qc7
If Black wants to deviate, he should now or on the next move analyse 10...Nce7 though it is not clear if this brings any advantages to Black. For example, now White a slightly unusual tactical motif created by Black's last move: 11.Bh6 and after
11...Nf5 (11...gxh6?? 12.Qxh6 leads to a disaster for Black) 12.Bd2 it is not clear
what Black has achieved with his knight pirouette, while the pawn grab 12...cxd4
13.cxd4
analysis diagram
13...Nxd4?? is a suicide after the simple 14.Ng5 h6 15.Nxf7.
11.Be3 c4
Here Black can also decide to deviate with 11...Nce7 and here we have a top-level game with Judit Polgar playing White. Black hopes to be 'more ready' for White's kingside attack. True to her style, Judit takes immediate action, and doesn't mind sacrificing a pawn in the process: 12.f4 (12.g4!? with a similar plan was another interesting option) 12...Qa5 13.Bd2 Qa4
14.g4! (direct and principled! In case of 14.dxc5 Black gets some compensation for
the pawn after 14...b6). Black will be under attack anyway, so he'd better grab a pawn: 14...c4! 15.Be2 Qxc2 16.Rc1 Qb2. Now White needs to provoke ...h6 in order to create a target: 17.Ng5 h6 18.Nh3 f6 19.g5 hxg5. A critical moment! Judit may have underestimated Black's defensive resources:
20.exf6? (she had to move her bishop to the b1-h7 diagonal: 20.Bd1! followed by
Bc2, with good compensation) 20...Rxf6! (prepares ...Nf8) 21.Nxg5 Nf8 and suddenly Black was better, though later the game ended in a draw, J. Polgar-Hillarp Persson, Malmö 2000.
12.Bxg6 fxg6 13.Qg4 Qf7 14.Nf4!
The point behind 10.Nh3.
14...Ne7
15.h4!
We have a situation similar to the Karjakin-Vallejo game, White having more or less two extra tempi.
15...h6
Caruana goes for the most straightforward and principled plan: pushing pawns on the kingside.
16.Qe2!
Deciding on Karjakin's idea with 16.a4!? and Bc1 also made sense here, as White has gained some time.
16...Bd7 17.g4!
Black's only possible counterplay is on the queenside.
17...b5 18.f3 a5
White needs to decide what to do with his king. It will be perfectly safe on the g3- square!
19.Kf2! Rab8 20.Kg3 Be8
21.Bd2
Fabiano takes his time, but there was no need to hesitate! White could have started an immediate attack with 21.h5! and Black does not have good way to stop it: A) In case of 21...b4 White opts for the simple 22.axb4 axb4 23.cxb4 Rxb4 24.hxg6 Nxg6 25.Nh5 analysis diagram and White has too many threats: Bxh6 or Nxg7. Active defence does not exist here as 25...Rb2 (25...Ra4 26.Raf1 only delays the execution) loses to 26.Bxh6! gxh6 (or
26...Rxc2 27.Qe3) 27.Nf6+ Kg7 28.Rxh6.
analysis diagram Black cannot prevent the mating threats: 28...Rh8 29.Rxh8 Nxh8 30.Qh2 Qg6 and now White comes from the other side: 31.Ra8 (31.Ra7+ wins a well, e.g. 31...Bf7
32.Ra8) 31...Rxc2 32.Qh4 etc.;
B) 21...g5 22.Nh3 g6 (22...b4 again does not give Black even a glimpse of counterplay: 23.axb4 axb4 24.cxb4 Rxb4 25.f4! gxf4+ 26.Nxf4 and now one of the rooks goes to f1 and the game is decided) 23.hxg6 analysis diagram
23...Qxg6 (if 23...Nxg6, White wins with a thematic sacrifice: 24.Nxg5! hxg5
25.Bxg5 and the h-file penetration combined with Bf6 proves fatal for Black). Now
White wins by simply doubling on the h-file: 24.Rh2 b4 25.axb4 axb4 26.cxb4 Rxb4
27.Rah1 Rb2 28.Ng1 (28.Nxg5 hxg5 29.Qd2 also wins).
Black's only chance here is via queenside counterplay, otherwise White wins as shown in the comment to 21.h5.
21...b4! 22.axb4 axb4
23.Rhb1!
23.cxb4? is not a good idea as Black gets real counterplay after 23...c3 24.Be3 Nc6.
23...Nc6 24.Qe3 b3
At first glance, it may look as if Shankland has created counterplay. However, Caruana calmly forces some necessary trades and dooms Black to passivity for the rest of the game. Very instructive play!
25.Bc1! Bd7 26.Ba3 bxc2
27.Rc1! Rfc8 28.Rxc2
Now White will penetrate with his rook on the queenside, while his Nf4 keeps Black busy defending his weaknesses.
28...Ra8 29.Rca2 Be8
Black could have tried 29...Ra5 30.Bd6 Rca8, hoping for a rooks trade: 31.Rxa5 Rxa5. analysis diagram Now what to trade and what to keep? White needs to keep one rook to be able to penetrate on the queenside! 32.Rb1, and ultimately the outcome will be similar to the game. A colossal strategic mistake would have been 32.Rxa5? Nxa5 as without the rooks Black is likely to survive here.
30.Bd6 Rxa2 31.Rxa2 Qd7 32.Qc1 Bf7
33.Qb1!
Forcing Black into absolute passivity.
33...Qe8 34.Qb7! Kh7 35.Ra6! Kg8
Black does not have any active moves, so Fabiano decides to reach the time control and then decide on the execution.
36.Bc7 Ne7 37.Bd6 Nc6 38.Kg2 Kh7 39.Kh3 Kg8 40.Kg3 Kh7
Obviously White has total domination, but how to win? Caruana's plan is instructive: fix the kingside when Black will have no moves, bring the Nf4 to the queenside and Black's defence, already pushed to the limit, will eventually break.
41.Nh3 Kg8 42.g5! h5
Black cannot say 'pass' as 42...Kh7? loses even faster after 43.gxh6 gxh6 44.Nf2. Now the knight starts on its journey.
43.Nf4! Kh7 44.Ng2 Bg8 45.Ne3 Bf7 46.Nc2 Bg8 47.Na3 Bf7
Not willing to risk blundering, Caruana brings his king to 'maximum safety' first.
48.Kf2 Bg8 49.Ke3 Bf7
The queen swap brings Black no salvation; 49...Qf7 50.Qxf7 Bxf7 51.Nb5 Kg8
52.Bc5 is hopeless.
50.Kd2 Bg8 51.Kc2 Bf7 52.Kc1
White's king is safe; now the knight will enter, forcing resignation.
52...Kg8
52...Bg8 is a similar story: 53.Nb5 and let's say Black hopes for some miracle
perpetual check: 53...Ne7 54.Na7! (54.Bxe7 is not a piece win after 54...Rb8!)
54...Qf7 55.Nxc8 Qf4+ 56.Kb1 Qd2 57.Nxe7. Black has lost all his pieces and only
has a few checks to give before resigning.
53.Nb5! Ne7
54.Na7! 1-0
Not 54.Bxe7?? when Black gets his piece back with 54...Rb8! and has good chances to save himself. An impressive and instructive game by Caruana. A dream situation for Black! Black has pushed his f-pawn, and the transaction exf6 Rxf6 has taken place. Black has timed his ...c4-pawn push well, gaining space and removing White's Bd3 from its active post. Black has also managed the difficult to execute improvement of his queen's bishop (...Bd7-e8-g6). White's bishops are passive (hitting their own pawns), while his damaged queenside structure is no longer an 'academic weakness'. This was a great game by Korchnoi, as we will see below. A true masterclass! Black plays ...f6 exf6 Rxf6 Game 28 Henrique Mecking 2630 Viktor Korchnoi 2665 Wijk aan Zee 1978 This game is very instructive for a good understanding of this type of positions and is another great example of how a game can be lost while playing only 'logical' moves.
1.e4 e6 2.d4 d5 3.Nc3 Bb4 4.e5 c5 5.a3 Bxc3+ 6.bxc3 Ne7 7.Qg4 O-O 8.Nf3
As mentioned in this chapter, modern theory regards 8.Bd3 as best and in this particular line, 8.Bd3 offers White extra possibilities - see Anand-Timman, Game 29.
8...Nbc6 9.Bd3
Korchnoi now goes for another typical Winawer pawn structure:
9...f5 10.exf6 Rxf6
We have a theoretical position, seen in many top-level games. Let's try to take stock. Black has seemingly weakened his kingside (pawn structure). White, with his active queen, bishop pair and knight, is ready to attack (he definitely has enough attackers) and can force Black to play either ...h6 or ...g6, weakening his king position further. Based on these arguments, logically White should be doing very well here. However, in reality things are rather complex. White's attack is not easy to develop, and Black's king is safer than it looks. White's active queen can be easily targeted (the ...e5 break, the ...Nf5 jump), the seemingly well placed Bd3 can be easily removed from its post by the ...c4 push. Your computer engine will tell you that the position is complex and that Black is not worse. However, I remember analysing these positions about 35-40 years back - in pre- computer days, when I was already a strong junior player. Firstly, I did not exactly understand why a player like Korchnoi kept playing such 'stupid positions' as Black. Next, I was not able to find a convincing way for White to develop his attack, and ultimately I came to the conclusion that these positions were unclear and Black may easily get the upper hand.
11.Qh5
Mecking decides to provoke ...h6. White could also have decided to provoke ...g6 with 11.Bg5 Rf7: A) Parting with his bishop in order to force Black's rook to e7 does not bring White an advantage: 12.Bxe7 Rxe7 13.Qh4 g6 and Black's king is less weak than it may look: 14.O-O. Now we see an important part of Black's strategy in this type of position. White's bishop is removed from its post, while Black takes space! 14...c4! 15.Be2 Qf8
16.Rfe1 Bd7 17.Bf1 Rae8 (Black is harmoniously developed and soon it will be the
second player who explores his attacking options on the kingside) 18.Qg5 Rf7
19.Qd2 Qd6 (White has to start watching out for the ...Rxf3 exchange sacrifice)
20.Ne5 Nxe5 21.Rxe5 Ref8. Black's pressure on the f-file fully compensates for the
weakness of his e6-pawn and - very important to notice - White's weak a3-pawn needs to be defended(!). Black had a comfortable position and went on to win in Ljubojevic-Beliavsky, Tilburg 1984; B) 12.Qh5 g6 13.Qh4. At first glance, White has a great attacking position. The reality, however, is quite different. First, White's bishops will be removed from their attacking posts and then his queen suddenly becomes a target. Probably, the objective assessment of the position should be 'dynamic, complex play with mutual chances'. 13...c4! 14.Be2 Qa5! 15.Bd2 Nf5 16.Qg5 (readers interested in opening theory should explore
16.Qh3!? here as White is now more ready for his g4 pawn push, while 16...e5? does
not seem to work as after 17.Nxe5! Nxe5 18.dxe5 Black does not have a good jump with his Nf5) 16...Bd7. Now, aiming to seize the initiative, Ljubojevic makes a risky decision: 17.g4!? (the alternative was 17.O-O with unclear play after 17...Nd6 or
17...Raf8 followed by ...Nf5-d6-e4) 17...Nd6 18.h4 Ne4 19.Qe3.
A critical moment! Black can seize the initiative but, as usual in such sharp positions, precision is needed. B1) Korchnoi went for 19...Raf8. After 20.h5 gxh5 21.Rxh5 Rg7 the game was unclear and White eventually emerged victorious in Ljubojevic-Korchnoi, Linares 1985; B2) The immediate central pawn break is Black's best option here: 19...e5! and White is in trouble. His best option is to try to create attacking chances of his own with 20.h5 exd4
21.Nxd4. An important moment! Black should keep the h-file closed! 21...g5!
(21...Re8 22.hxg6 hxg6 23.Rh6 with unclear play and a later draw was seen in Ernst- Hansen, Ostersund 1992). Now White has to disturb Black's knight: 22.f3 (22.Nxc6? Bxc6 23.f3 is wrong as after 23...d4! 24.cxd4 Nxd2 25.Qxd2 c3 26.Qd3 Qc7 White's king is weak) 22...Nxd4 and Black gets a better endgame after 23.cxd4 (23.Qxd4? is asking for trouble in view of 23...Re8!) 23...Qxd2+ 24.Qxd2 Nxd2 25.Kxd2 Re8.
11...h6 12.O-O
Now Black takes an important and typical strategic decision in such positions which we already mentioned in the above comments:
12...c4!
White Bd3 is removed from its post while Black gains space! It is important to note that Black should not postpone this decision for too long as at some stage White will take dxc5.
13.Be2 Qa5 14.Bd2
A fancy move like 14.Bg5? does not work for White here: 14...hxg5 15.Nxg5 Ng6 and White will soon regret his decision to sacrifice.
14...Bd7
An important moment! White has to be careful not to become worse and needs to jump with his knight to e5 here.
15.Rfb1?!
15.Ne5! was needed and now:
A) 15...Be8! 16.Qh4 (White does not get enough compensation for his pawn after
16.Qh3 Nxd4 17.Bg4 Ndf5)
16...Nf5 (an interesting strategic decision here was to enter a 2 Ns vs 2Bs fight with
16...Bg6!? 17.Nxg6 Nxg6 18.Qg4 Raf8 where Black is definitely not worse)
17.Nxc6 (17.Qg4? Nfxd4) 17...Bxc6 18.Qf4 Raf8 with equality in the game Jaracz-
Khusnutdinov, chess.com 2021; B) 15...Nxe5 16.Qxe5 Nc6 is less convincing for Black as after 17.Qe3 Be8 18.Bg4 Bg6 19.Bxe6+ Kh7 20.Bd7 Bxc2 21.Rfe1 Raf8 22.f3 Qc7
23.Bxc6! though your engine will give you around zeros, this opposite-coloured
bishops position is, due to his safer king and more active bishop, easier to play for White who ended up victorious in the game Zelcic-Nisipeanu, Zagreb 2019.
15...Qc7 16.Nh4?
White wants to push f4 in order to stop Black's ...e5 push. The consequence of this strategic decision (a mistake that will cost White the game) is that White's Bd2 will be passive, surrounded by its own pawns, whilc Black's bishop will become a monster once it is transferred to g6. This was White's last chance to go for 16.Ne5! and after 16...Be8 17.Qg4 Nxe5... analysis diagram ... White needs to decide on the dynamic 18.Qg3! (18.dxe5 is better for Black after
18...Qxe5 19.Rxb7 Qd6). Now the position looks better for Black to me, however
Stockfish finds dynamic ways for White to keep the balance.
16...Raf8 17.f4 Be8! 18.Qg4
18...Ng6!
The right trade!
19.Nxg6 Bxg6
White is strategically lost! Korchnoi's execution is instructive and done with a steady hand.
20.Ra2
Black's Nc6 needs to be improved.
20...Ne7! 21.Rab2 b6 22.Qh3 Nf5 23.Re1 Qe7 24.Ra2
Note the poor Ra2 - out of play and defending the weak a3- and c2-pawns. Black's N+B totally dominate White's two Bs here.
24...Nd6 25.Bf3 Ne4 26.Bxe4
A sad neccessity. White has to enter a strategically lost opposite-coloured bishops position.
26...Bxe4 27.g3 Qf7 28.Qg4
Time for Black to open up the kingside and launch a direct attack:
28...g5!
Now White has to try to bring his rook into play, so Black can collect a pawn for free.
29.Raa1 Rf5 30.Rf1 Bxc2 31.Rf2 Qg6 32.Re1 Be4
White could have safely resigned here. Black threatens 33...h5 and White's position will collapse. The rest of the game does not need any comment: White gives an exchange and, probably driven by inertia, plays some more unnecessary moves.
33.Rxe4 dxe4 34.Kf1 Rb5 35.Qe2 Rb1+ 36.Kg2 Rb2 37.Qxc4 e3 38.Bxe3 Qe4+
39.Kh3 Rxf2 40.Bxf2 gxf4 41.gxf4 Rxf4 42.Bg3 Rf5 43.Qc8+ Rf8 44.Qc4 h5
45.Qb5 Qg4+ 46.Kg2 h4
And White resigned. A powerful instructive strategic lecture by Korchnoi! A happy scenario for White The pawn structure is almost the same as in the previous diagram, but with some small differences! Here, Black's bishop is passive on d7 while White's bishop is excellently placed on e5, and Black's king is potentially vulnerable. White is happy here. This was a great game by Anand. The advantage of White's knight still being on g1 Game 29 Viswanathan Anand 2771 Jan Timman 2650 Dortmund 1999
1.e4 e6 2.d4 d5 3.Nc3 Bb4 4.e5 Ne7 5.a3 Bxc3+ 6.bxc3 c5 7.Qg4 O-O 8.Bd3
As we will see, this move-order gives White an important extra option compared to the game Mecking-Korchnoi we just saw.
8...f5 9.exf6 Rxf6
Now White first provokes ...g6, weakening the dark squares:
10.Bg5 Rf7 11.Qh5 g6
Now White uses the fact that he played 8.Bd3 instead of 8.Nf3:
12.Qd1!
Black now has a vulnerable kingside while, compared to Ljubojevic-Korchnoi (in the comments to the game Mecking-Korchnoi), White's queen is not exposed.
12...Nbc6
Black will place his queen on f8 in order to push ...h6. Another possible plan for Black was 12...Qa5 13.Bd2 and now: A) In case Black opts for 13...Nbc6 14.Nf3 c4 (opening the centre with 14...Qc7
15.O-O e5 plays into White's hands here as after 16.dxe5 Nxe5 17.Be2 Bd7 18.Re1
the open position suits the side with a bishop pair, and also Black has problems defending his central d5-pawn, e.g. 18...Nxf3+ 19.Bxf3 Bc6 20.Bg5 (20...Rd8, moving under the pin, is not really an option here) 20...Raf8 21.Bxe7 Rxe7
22.Bxd5+ Bxd5 23.Qxd5+ and White was a sound pawn up and went on to win in
Eljanov-Naiditsch, Douglas 2016) 15.Be2 Bd7. Yes, Black did close the centre, but compared to Ljubojevic-Korchnoi, White's queen cannot be targeted and the dark-square weaknesses in Black's camp become important. Black struggles to create counterplay: 16.O-O Kg7 17.Qc1! Ng8 18.Bf4. In this difficult position, Black sacrifices an exchange in the hope to get counterplay:
18...Raf8 19.Bd6 Qxc3. White is not in a hurry to take the Rf8 and will do so at a
moment of his choosing: 20.a4! Nf6 21.Rd1 Ne4 22.Ra3 Qa5 23.Bxf8+ Rxf8 24.c3 and White had a material advantage and went on to win in Topalov-Jussupow, Dortmund 1997; B) 13...Nd7 14.Nf3. Now Black follows a standard plan in this type position: 14...c4
15.Be2 Nc6.
White decides, similar to Mecking vs Korchnoi, to gain space and to disallow Black's ...e5 pawn push: 16.Ng5 (instead, White could have started an unpleasant immediate attack with 16.h4! followed by h5, Ng5, and Black's situation would not have been easy) 16...Re7 17.f4 Nf6 18.O-O. If we compared this to Mecking-Korchnoi (as we have the same central pawn structure), White is in considerably better shape as Black's bishop cannot be placed on g6. However White has also limited his own dark-squared bishop and game is balanced: 18...Bd7 19.a4 Rf8 20.Bf3.
20...Nd8! (Black wants to trade off the Ng5 and then jump with his own knight to the
central e4-square) 21.Qc1 (on 21.Bc1, Black has a promising exchange sacrifice:
21...Qxc3! 22.Ba3 Rfe8 with ...Nc6 to follow and a great game) 21...Nf7 22.Qa3
Ree8 (the position is about equal) 23.Nxf7 Rxf7 24.Rfe1 Bc6. Not seeing a better way to proceed, White simplifies into a drawn endgame: 25.Qb4 Qxb4 26.cxb4 Ne4
27.Bxe4 dxe4 28.c3 Bd5 and a draw was soon agreed in Karjakin-Carlsen, Sao
Paulo/Bilbao 2012.
13.Nf3 c4
We have one top-level game with an instructive strategic mistake. Let's see it:
13...Qf8 14.O-O c4 15.Be2 h6 16.Bc1! Bd7 17.Ne1 (there was no reason to hurry
with this knight retreat; 17.a4!, keeping all options open, looked promising) 17...g5
18.g3 Nf5 19.Ng2 Qg7. Now White would like to open the position for his dark
squared bishop: 20.f4 Nd6 And now comes a mutual strategic/ positional blunder:
21.Qe1? (good, and in the spirit of 20.f4, was 21.fxg5! Rxf1+ (or 21...hxg5 22.Rxf7
with 23.Ne3 to follow) 22.Bxf1 hxg5 23.Ne3 and White has a promising position: his bishop pair will start working, and the black king can become vulnerable)
21...b5? (Black misses a great opportunity to close the position and play for
domination on the light squares with 21...g4! with the simple plan ...h5, ...Ne4, ...Ne7, ...Nf5 and White's Bc1 may easily be reduced to a 'big pawn'). Now White did not miss his second chance and played 22.fxg5! Rxf1+ 23.Bxf1 hxg5 24.Ne3 Rf8
25.Bg2 and White had a better game and went on to win in Ponomariov-Ivanchuk,
Linares 2002. Vishy is going to use the power of his bishops combined with Black's weak king position and will win this game with great ease. It's really not clear where Timman might have made a mistake from here on.
14.Be2 Qf8
Now Anand cleverly delays castling and places his bishop on the dominant central e5-square:
15.Qc1!
Black has to push through ...h6 now.
15...Nf5 16.h4! h6 17.Bf4 Bd7
White makes sure his dark-squared bishop remains the dominant piece for the rest of the game:
18.Ne5! Nxe5 19.Bxe5 Ne7
Black needs to chase away White's bishop from e5.
20.Qe3 Nc6 21.Bg3 Re8
22.h5! g5
Now White will soon come with the f4 push; the kingside will be opened and Black's king will be vulnerable.
23.O-O Ne7 24.Be5! Nc6 25.Bh2 Rg7
Black has no counterplay, while White easily improves his pieces further.
26.Bg4! Qf6 27.Rae1 Qe7 28.a4 b6 29.Qh3!
Black's only chance here is to grab a pawn and hope...
29...Nd8 30.Re2 Bxa4
31.f4! Bd7 32.f5! Rf7 33.Rfe1
Black's position is collapsing so Timman seizes his best practical chance: he gives an exchange and hopes to reach a drawish ending.
33...Rf6 34.Be5 Rxf5 35.Bxf5 exf5 36.Bc7 Ne6 37.Qxf5
Black has to trade queens in order not to get mated:
37...Qf7 38.Qxf7+ Kxf7 39.Bd6 a5
Unfortunately for Black, his queenside pawns do not offer any real hopes of counterplay. Anand wraps up efficiently.
40.Rf1+ Kg7 41.Re5! Nf4 42.Rxe8 Bxe8
Now, an important check:
43.Be5+! Kg8 44.Bxf4 gxf4 45.Rxf4
46.Rf6 needs to be stopped, so Black has no time to take White's h5-pawn.
45...Kg7 46.g4 a4 47.Kh2 1-0
An instructive victory by Anand! A double-edged position This is a typical modern double-edged position. We have many recent top games here (Ruslan Ponomariov and Richard Rapport are currently the main protagonists for the Black side). This is a very popular type of pawn structure - take your time to study the next three games thoroughly! White doesn't need to worry yet about the a4-pawn or doubled c-pawns, but at some stage, he may. White has a considerable kingside space advantage, but the tricky bit is: at a convenient moment, Black wants to open the position with ...f6 or ...f5... so both sides are actually playing on the kingside! The ensuing positions are very complex and easy to misplay. Closed position, typical plans, exposed white queen Game 30 Zoltan Almasi 2650 Alexander Beliavsky 2615 Hungary tt 1996/97 This game is another great example of how strategically sensitive these positions are and how easy it is, even for a world class player, to get into trouble. In a similar way as in Mecking-Korchnoi, Almasi makes 'logical moves' and still finds himself in terrible trouble in no time!
1.e4 e6 2.d4 d5 3.Nc3 Bb4 4.e5 c5 5.a3 Bxc3+ 6.bxc3 Ne7 7.Qg4 Qc7
This move usually leads to very sharp lines where theoretical knowledge and memory are of crucial importance. If White wants to avoid long, computer-prepared lines here, sometimes he opts for:
8.Bd3
Mainstream theory is 8.Qxg7 when after 8...Rg8 9.Qxh7 cxd4 White has an equally interesting choice between 10.Ne2, 10.Kd1!? or 10.Qd3. The resulting positions are sharp, heavily (engine-)analysed, and I have not included them in this book because (cloud) computer engines preparation, good memory etc. are more important elements here than understanding Winawer fundamentals.
8.Bd2 is another attempt to avoid theory; however, it is little played as White fails to
find an advantage in the lines after 8...cxd4 9.cxd4 Qxc2.
8.Bd3 is a tricky sideline where Black needs to know his stuff! Best here is to use the
standard way to immediately close the position in the centre:
8...c4!
8...h5?, trying to force White into sharp Qxg7-type lines, can lead to a disaster for
Black: 9.Qxg7 Rg8 10.Qh6 cxd4 11.Ne2. With White's bishop already developed to d3, Black has a terrible version of the 8. Qxg7 lines. After 11...Nbc6 12.cxd4 Bd7
13.Be3 O-O-O 14.Qxh5 White had a massive advantage and soon won in Velimirovic-
Uhlmann, Vrsac 1973. The pawn grab 8...cxd4 is not really a good idea either: 9.Ne2 analysis diagram
9...dxc3 (or 9...Qxe5 10.cxd4 h5 - (of course, not blundering a queen with
10...Qf6?? 11.Bg5) - 11.Qh4 Qc7 12.O-O when Black has problems finishing his
development and with his king in the centre; White has more than sufficient compensation for the pawn) 10.Qxg7 Rg8 11.Qxh7 Qxe5 12.h4. Black is a pawn up, but the h-pawn is fast. White has an excellent version of the 8.Qxg7 lines here.
9.Be2 Qa5
It would be a serious strategic mistake to compare this position to Mecking- Korchnoi, thinking 'White will play 10.Nf3 next' and castling kingside here. Beliavsky made this mistake and was swiftly punished for it two years prior to this game: 9...O-O?. Unfortunately for Black, White's Ng1 stays on its initial square for the time being:
10.h4! f6. Black hopes to open the centre and get counterplay - sorry, this will not
happen! The centre stays closed: 11.f4!. White now simply rolls his kingside pawns while Black does not have any meaningful counterplay. White has a massive advantage already: 11...Nbc6 12.Nf3
12...b5 (one of the earlier examples went 12...Qa5 13.Bd2 Qa4 14.Ra2 and now
White took action on the kingside and quickly won in Velimirovic-Lengyel, Vrnjacka Banja 1973) 13.h5 a5 (Black has futile hopes of counterplay; in case of
13...h6, White builds up a kingside attack with the simple 14.Qh3 a5 15.g4) 14.Bd2
(the immediate 14.h6 was also good) 14...Rb8. Given the absence of counterplay for Black, White has different ways to proceed here. Polgar is not in a hurry: 15.O-O. Now Black does not have much of a choice but to push his b-pawn: 15...b4 16.axb4 axb4 17.cxb4 c3 (in case of 17...Nxb4, Black lands in a strategically lost position after 18.h6 g6 19.exf6 Rxf6 20.Bxb4 Rxb4 21.Ne5) 18.Bxc3 Nxe5 19.fxe5 Qxc3
20.Bd3 (20.Ra7 wins as well) 20...h6 (or 20...Rxb4 21.Ra7) 21.b5 and White is up a
pawn and has the better position on top of it. White quickly won in Polgar- Beliavsky, Linares 1994. The immediate 9...Nf5 was also possible, leading to a type of play similar to the text.
10.Bd2 Nf5
11.Nf3
In a higher sense, this natural developing move is the start of White's troubles as Almasi is not aware of the exposure his queen may be subjected to. The position is dynamically balanced. Black is going to castle queenside and prepare the opening of the kingside (most probably with the ...f6 push) while White also needs to watch out a bit on the queenside, given his pawn structure weaknesses there. Computer engines respect space in such positions, so your engine will give you a 'White's advantage' assessment but things are far from the way they initially seem and 'dynamic balance' is a better assessment here. I will now give a recent example of another very strong grandmaster getting into trouble with White in this line: 11.h4 (Ivan Saric, in a game against Furlan, has a reasonable idea: he pushes pawns and gains space on the kingside) 11...Qa4 12.Bd1 Nc6 13.h5 h6 14.Qf4 Bd7 15.g4 Nfe7. It's time for White to develop the Ng1. Compared to Almasi's queen in our game, White's queen is far from exposed here, so Saric is in good shape: 16.Nf3 Rg8 (preparing queenside castling) 17.Nh4 O-O-O (Black wants to play ...Rdf8 and ...f6 so White makes this standard rook lift to stop it) 18.Rh3 Rdf8 19.Rf3
19...b6 (Black has to be patient as White has an advantage in case of 19...f6 20.exf6
Rxf6 21.Qd6) 20.Qg3. The position is strategically balanced, and both sides find it not easy to improve. Black, playing an opponent who is more than 300 Elo points higher rated, is happy with the status quo. Note that Black could have immediately opted for the game plan of bringing his knight to d8, or for ...a5 followed by ...Na7, ...Nb5, which is another standard plan here. 20...Qb5 21.Bc1 Qa4 22.Kf1 Kb7. A logical run of play in such positions. The queenside is blocked while White, despite his space advantage, has problems improving on the kingside. 23.Rf4 (the 'active' 23.g5 is not well timed as Black has excellent play after 23...hxg5 24.Bxg5 Be8 or 24...f6) 23...Be8 24.Qf3 Nd8! (this move enables some tactical ideas based on the fact that Black is the one who will be opening the kingside!) 25.Rb1. A) Here Black had an interesting aggressive option, the motifs behind which are useful to remember, in 25...g5!? 26.hxg6 f5! (the kingside opens up and Black is ready for it!) 27.gxf5 (after 27.exf6 Black, with his well-coordinated pieces, gets excellent compensation with 27...Nxg6) 27...exf5. analysis diagram Now we see all the advantages of placing the black knight on d8! 28.Qh3 Ne6
29.Rf3 Bxg6 30.Nxg6 (in case of 30.Bxh6? Rf7 31.Nxg6 Rxg6 32.Bc1 f4! we have
another excellent example of White playing all the logical moves and everything going wrong! Black has a close to winning advantage here as the two knights are clearly superior to the two bishops) 30...Rxg6 31.Rg3 with complicated play in a dynamically balanced position; B) Black continues with his wait-and-see strategy: 25...a5. And now, out of frustration due to a combination of factors: not being able to make progress while playing a considerably lower-rated opponent with White, does its job and Ivan Saric takes an irresponsible decision: 26.Ng6? (a strategic mistake which should have been losing. White helps Black to obtain excellent play on the kingside) 26...Nxg6
27.hxg6 Qd7. Most probably by now, Saric understood what he had done and now
he hopes to maintain the position by playing neutral moves: 28.Be2 (28.gxf7 Nxf7 plays further into Black's hands) 28...Ka7 29.Ra1
29...Qe7!. No more jokes! White is stuck between a rock and a hard place and has to
decide between taking on f7, opening the f-file to Black's advantage, and losing a pawn for nothing. Saric opted for the latter: 30.a4 fxg6 and Black was a pawn up for nothing though White ultimately saved a draw in Saric-Furlan, Slovenia tt 2022.
30.gxf7 leads to a bad position for White after 30...Nxf7 31.Qg3 Ba4! 32.Ra2 Ng5
(White cannot surrender the f-file here, while 33...Ne4 is a threat) 33.f3 Rb8 and White is in terrible shape as he will need to give material in order to save his Rf4.
11...Nc6 12.Qh5?!
This certainly does not help White.
12.h4 Bd7 13.h5 h6 14.Qf4 with 15.g4 to follow was needed, leading to play similar
to Saric-Furlan from the previous comment. Again... do not draw any easy conclusions based on your computer engine giving White a slight advantage here!
12...h6
Now it's high time for White to be careful!
13.O-O?
13.g4 was needed, keeping the king on e1.
13...Bd7 14.Rfb1 O-O-O!
By now Zoltan most probably understood the trouble he'd got himself into! Black is clearly better. White queen is terribly placed. One of Black's ideas is ...Rdg8, ...g7- g5-g4, ...Be8 and ...f6. Almasi now continues according to the logic, 'if I have to suffer, I'd better grab a pawn':
15.Qxf7 g5
16.Be1?
This loses decisive material. The only way for White to stay in the game was with the drastic measure 16.g4! and after 16...Rdf8 17.Qh5 Be8 18.Qh3 Nfe7 White is still in the game. However, with ideas like ...Ne7-g6-f4 with ...h5 to follow Black has plenty of compensation: White's position can collapse at any moment.
16...g4
Now it's over. White's queen cannot be saved.
17.Nd2 Rhg8 18.h3
Or 18.a4 Rdf8 19.Qh7 Nce7 with ...Rh8 or ...Rg7 to follow.
18...Rdf8 19.Qxf8+ Rxf8 20.hxg4 Nfe7 21.Nf1
Black is up a queen for a rook and has the better position too.
21...Be8! 22.Bd2 Bg6 23.Bxh6 Rh8 24.Bd2 Bxc2 25.Rb2 Bg6 26.Ng3 Qc7 27.Bd1
Many moves win here. Beliavsky finishes with a simple tactic:
27...Nxd4! 0-1
Black plays ...c4, fixing the pawn chain Game 31 Ivan Saric 2668 Mateusz Bartel 2630 Germany Bundesliga 2022/23 The pawn structure in this game can be compared to that in Almasi-Beliavsky and Karjakin-Grischuk. This game is another example of how easy it is, even for a very strong player, to go wrong in these strategically complex positions.
1.e4 e6 2.d4 d5 3.Nc3 Bb4 4.e5 c5 5.a3 Bxc3+ 6.bxc3 Nc6!?
A relative sideline. We will, however, not focus on the opening here but will try to understand the strategic compexities of the ensuing positions.
7.Qg4
Arguably White's main line here - in any case, the most direct line. White is asking a direct question to Black, who now has to either weaken his kingside or lose his right to castle. At a high level, White players have tried different moves here: 7.Nf3, or 7.a4, or my personal favourite 7.h4.
7...g6
The future of Black's king will probably be on the queenside. At some stage (soon), Black will close the centre with the standard ...c4 push. We have many top-level games here. I have chosen a few examples that I thought to be instructive, outlining possible plans and objectives.
8.h4
One high-level game saw an interesting struggle here: 8.Bd2 Bd7 9.h4 (for the time being, Black has to keep the kingside closed) 9...h6 10.Bd3 Qe7!? (Black places his queen on e7, hoping to be better prepared to create counterplay by pushing ...f6 or ...f5) 11.Nh3 O-O-O 12.O-O. Black needs to be careful: if he doesn't close the centre on time, White might take dxc5: 12...c4! 13.Be2 Be8 (Black is getting ready to open up the kingside and create counterplay) 14.Nf4 Kb8 15.a4 Ka8 (getting all set to push his f-pawn) 16.Bc1!? Anand is asking Ponomariov a tough question! If Pono pushes his f-pawn, it will be a difficult-to- calculate pawn sacrifice, while if not, Vishy will play the unpleasant
17. Ba3.
Most probably White's best option was the prophylactic 16.Qh3! because 16...f5?? now blunders a pawn for nothing since after 17.exf6 Nxf6 White's queen is not attacked and he can simply take 18.Nxe6, with a winning advantage. Ponomariov makes the right call: 16...f5! (for the sacrificed pawn, Black gets a kingside attack)
17.exf6 Nxf6 18.Qxe6 (the zwischenzug 18.Ba3!? was worth considering) 18...Qg7
(Black will soon push ...g5 and start attack on the white king; he definitely has sufficient compensation here) 19.Qh3 Bd7 20.Qg3. An important moment. Ruslan underestimates White's strategic threat of trading the kinghts: 20...Bf5 21.Nh5! and with the knights off the board Black's situation is not nearly as good. Suddenly White is better, though Black managed to save a draw in Anand-Ponomariov, Leon 2007. More precise was 20...Rhg8!, preparing ...g5 while not allowing the knight trade:
21.Bf3 Qf7! and Pono's pawn sac idea would have worked to perfection - White
would have been in serious trouble here! A logical continuation might be 22.Nh3 g5
23.hxg5 Bxh3 24.Qxh3 hxg5 and White has only one move to avoid immediate
annihilation: 25.g4; however after 25...Qg6 he is in serious trouble. The power of his bishop pair is contained, while his king is weak and prone to immediate attack. Black now has to opt for the standard reaction to White's h-pawn push:
8...h6 9.a4
Another interesting recent high-level game went 9.Qf4 Qa5 10.Bd2. As usual, here Black correctly closed the centre: 10...c4! 11.a4 Bd7 12.Be2 Rh7 (Black needs to castle queenside) 13.Nf3 O-O-O 14.O-O
14...Re8 (given the fact that Black wants to open the kingside to create counterplay,
it looks more logical to play 14...Rf8 immediately, as Rapport did later in the game. My explanation for Richard not doing this is that maybe he could not evaluate the pawn sacrifice 15.Bc1!? Qxc3 16.Ba3) 15.Rfb1 (Black's king is reasonably safe, and White's 'attack plan' only loses time) 15...Kb8 (the immediate 15...Qd8 followed by ...f6 was good too). Now White 'forced' Black to execute his plan with 16.Rb5? (16.Nh2 with Ng4 to follow, trying to slow down Black's f-pawn push, made more sense): 16...Qd8 17.g3 Ka8. White now admits that his 'attacking plan' was a loss of time: 18.Rbb1 Rf8 with ...f6 to follow (perhaps it was even more precise to start immediate kingside action with
18...f6!) and Black had a great game. Later, the game Santos Latasa-Rapport,
Mayrhofen 2022, ended in a draw.
9...Qa5 10.Bd2 Bd7
11.Ne2
White could now have decided to totally change the character of the game with
11.dxc5!? after which we suddenly get a 'blow for blow' tactical battle! Play may
continue 11...Nxe5 12.Qd4 f6 13.c4! Qc7 14.cxd5 exd5 with complications. Here, White's bishop pair is an asset!
11...O-O-O 12.Nf4 c4 13.g3
13...Nge7
Black had an interesting and unusual tactical idea here that is worth remembering:
13...Nf6! when the most principled reaction is to accept the pawn sacrifice, though it
rather seems like White is looking for trouble: 14.exf6 (Black is certainly not worse after 14.Qf3 Ne4) 14...e5 15.Qf3 exf4 16.Qxf4. analysis diagram White has got a pawn, but his king is stuck in the centre. The position is complicated and difficult to evaluate (though my Stockfish gives zeros). A logical continuation is
16...g5 17.Qf3 Rhe8+ 18.Kd1 Re4 19.hxg5 Rde8! (Black wants to play 20... Nxd4;
19...Bg4? blunders into the simple 20.Bh3) 20.Rh4! Nxd4 21.Qh1.
analysis diagram In a game between humans, something is bound to go wrong here for one of the sides. Stockfish assesses it as a dynamic balance. 21...Re1+! 22.Bxe1 Rxe1+
23.Kd2! Rxa1 24.Rxd4 hxg5. Now White has to be clever and understand the need
to open the h2-b8 diagonal for Qh2+: 25.g4! (25.Rxd5?? blunders into 25...Rxf1)
25...Be6 26.Qh8+ Kd7 27.Bg2 with unclear play, certainly for humans, while the
silicon brain still gives zeroes.
14.Bh3
This is a typical kind of position we can get in this line. In the game, White finds it difficult to make progress, while Black gets ready to push the f-pawn and create kingside activity. Again, I advise you: do NOT draw any 'easy conclusions' based on your computer engine giving White some plus here. The reality in human play is very different - we have a complex, unclear game here! In human play position may in some sense be easier to play with Black. Objectively, White probably has some advantage, but Black has a relatively clear plan: to push ...f6 or ...f5 and take action on the kingside, favouring him. At the same time, White needs to be clever and has to improve his position while anticipating Black's actions. Ivan Saric did not manage to find a clever way to regroup, and in the game Black's plan worked to perfection.
14...Kb8 15.Qf3 Ka8 16.Ng2
A better way to regroup was probably 16.Ne2 Rdf8 17.g4 Ng8... analysis diagram and now White can improve his bishop with 18.Bc1! f6 19.Ba3 Rf7 20.Bd6. The position is dynamic and tense, but White should have an advantage after, for example, 20...Rhh7 21.Qe3.
16...Rdf8 17.Ne3 Ng8
18.O-O?!
18.Nxd5 could have proved a risky decision after 18...Nxe5 19.dxe5 Bc6, though our
silicon friend gives some complicated lines leading to around zero. White no longer has an advantage, but he has to stop Black's 'perfect execution' of the f-pawn push: 18.Ng4! Qd8 19.Nf6 Nxf6 20.Qxf6 Qxf6 21.exf6 with approximately equal play. Now the time has come for Black's kingside action:
18...f5! 19.exf6 Nxf6
Black has taken over the initiative.
20.Qe2 g5
An important moment! How should White react?
21.hxg5?
White helps Black's attack by opening the h-file for him.
21.h5 was necessary, when Black has a great game but the fight is very much on.
21...hxg5
In a higher sense, this position is winning for Black. He has an attack 'free of charge' with many different motifs, while White does not have even a glimpse of meaningful counterplay. In the following, Bartel could have executed differently, or perhaps faster, but the end result is never in doubt.
22.Bg2
22.Kg2 loses to 22...Ne4 with terrible threats like ...Nxd4 or ...Qc7 followed by
...Rxf2 and ...Qxg3+.
22...Bc8 23.Rfc1 Qc7 24.Nf1
Black has a winning attack, and many different options.
24...Qg7
Also good was 24...Qh7 25.Bxg5 Ne4 or 24...Ne4 25.Be1 g4.
25.f3 Nh5 26.Re1 Qg6
Black could also win with the thematic sacrifice 26...Nf4 27.gxf4 gxf4 with the unstoppable idea of ...Qh6, ...Rfg8,...Qh1+.
27.Bc1 Rf7 28.Qf2 Rfh7 29.Ne3 Ne7 30.Ba3 Nf5
Black has a mating attack and full domination. White's bishops are just a pair of two big pawns here.
31.Nxf5 exf5 32.f4 gxf4 33.Qf3
33.gxf4 loses to 33...Nf6 34.Kf1 Ne4.
33...Nxg3 34.Bc1 Ne4 35.Kf1
35...Qg3
An immediate tactical win was 35...Rh1+! 36.Bxh1 Rxh1+ 37.Ke2 Rh2+ 38.Kd1 Qg4 39.Qxg4 Nxc3#.
36.Bxf4
36.Qxg3 fxg3 is equally hopeless for White.
36...Rh1+ 37.Ke2 Nxc3+ 38.Kd2 Ne4+ 39.Ke2 Rxe1+ 40.Rxe1 Qg6
The time control has been reached. Black could have won faster, but nothing has been spoilt. Black is two pawns up and has an attack.
41.Kf1 c3 42.Kg1 Rg8 43.a5 Bd7 44.Qh3 Ba4 45.Re2 Qf6 46.Be5 Qg5 47.a6 Bb5

53...Rb6! 54.Bh3 Rb1+ 55.Kh2 Rf1 0-1
Closed center with ...c4, black king on the queenside Game 32 Sergey Karjakin 2747 Alexander Grischuk 2745 Moscow 2022 In this game, the pawn structure and plans are comparable to the games Saric-Bartel and Almasi-Beliavsky. Karjakin goes for a slightly different set-up as White, pushing his pawn to f4 to try to control the space.
1.e4 e6 2.d4 d5 3.Nc3 Bb4 4.e5 c5 5.a3 Bxc3+ 6.bxc3 Ne7
White now chooses for a popular variation which was introduced on high level by Garry Kasparov in his game vs Anand in Linares 1992.
7.h4 Qc7
The above-mentioned game featured White playing a typical pawn sacrifice:
7...Nbc6 8.h5 Qa5 9.Bd2 cxd4 10.cxd4 Qa4.
White is not obliged to sacrifice a pawn here, but Kasparov does it as his development advantage, bishop pair, and initiative will more than compensate for the minimal material investment: 11.Nf3! (your engine will tell you that White has some advantage after 11.c3 Qxd1+ 12.Kxd1) 11...Nxd4 12.Bd3 Nec6 13.Kf1! (14.Rh4 is a threat now, so Black needs to decide what to do with his Nd4) 13...Nxf3 14.Qxf3. Compare this to the typical pawn sacrifice in the game Anand-Nikolic. White has a development advantage and Black's king is vulnerable. Anand is in a hurry to complete his development, and for good reason: 14...b6 (Black cannot afford to lose time with 14...h6? as after 15.Qg3 Black cannot defend his kingside - the rook lift Rh4 is coming) 15.h6 Ba6 16.hxg7 Rg8 17.Bxa6 Qxa6+ 18.Kg1 Rxg7 19.Qf6 Rg8
20.Rxh7. Material is equal while Black's king problem is still not solved. White had
a clear advantage, but Black managed to survive in Kasparov-Anand, Linares 1992.
8.h5 h6 9.Rb1 b6
Black wants to play ...Ba6, trading the light squared bishops. White resorts to a typical way to avoid this:
10.Bb5+
In another (well-known) top-level game, White opted for a different strategy:
10.Qg4. White immediately bothers Black on the kingside so that Black will lose his
right to castle and his king remains on the queenside: 10...Rg8 11.Bb5+ Kf8 (11...Bd7 does not improve the situation as after 12.Bd3, 13.Bh7 is a threat and Black has to play ...Kf8 anyway) 12.Bd3. Even though quite a number of very strong players have opted for a similar set-up as Black, I am not fond of it as Black will have to spend a considerable amount of time to solve his Kf8 problem and bring his Rg8 into play: 12...Ba6. White wants to open up the queenside to make Black feel the problem of activating his Rg8, so he decides to change the central pawn structure: 13.dxc5 Bxd3 14.cxd3 Nd7 (an alternative was 14...Qxe5+ 15.Ne2 Nd7, though the Rg8 problem remains and White should be better) 15.d4 bxc5. White's queen has done her job of disrupting Black's development on the kingside: 16.Qd1! Qa5 17.Bd2. White had some advantage and went on to win in Vachier Lagrave-Nepomniachtchi, Yekaterinburg 2020.
10...Bd7 11.Bd3 Ba4 12.Rh4
A typical rook lift, asking Black to decide about the pawn structure.
12...c4! 13.Be2 Nd7
The structure is similar to Saric-Bartel and Almasi-Beliavsky. Black will castle queenside and at some stag aim for counterplay with ...f6. Other than Saric and Almasi, Karjakin decides to take more space by pushing his f-pawn. This is a logical strategy, but he won't find it easy to build further on it.
14.f4 O-O-O 15.Nf3 Kb7 16.Rh3 a5 17.Be3
Pay attention now to the way Grischuk manoeuvres his Nd7 - typical play in such positions!
17...Nb8!
White is trying to improve his pieces, starting with his king, but he doesn't find it easy to make progress:
18.Kf1 Nbc6 19.Kg1 Na7! 20.Qc1 Nb5 21.Qb2 Ka6
Black has no reason to complain as his Nb5+Ba4 are keeping White's queen out of play (i.e., busy defending pawn weaknesses).
22.Nd2
Now Black has to be careful not to blunder into some Nxc4 type sacrifice.
22...Rc8 23.Bf2
White wants to manoeuvre Nd2-f1-e3 while also being able to bring his bishop to h4. Grischuk now goes for an interesting queen manoeuvre:
23...Qd7!?
Black's queen will travel all the way to h7. Actually, he could have opted for 23...f6
24.Nf1 (24.Bg4 brings White nowhere for various reasons, e.g. 24...f5 (or simply
24...Qd7) 25.Be2 g5 26.hxg6 Rcg8) 24...fxe5 25.fxe5 (25.dxe5, opening the diagonal
for the Bf2, has the drawback that White's centre is undermined after 25...Rcf8
26.Qc1 g5!). The position is dynamically balanced and strategically complicated.
Black has nothing to complain about, and can continue 25...g5 or 25...g6.
24.Ra1
This is more or less a loss of tempo. The immediate 24.Nf1 looked more consistent and more logical. Grischuk continues with his plan of bringing the queen to h7:
24...Qe8
24...f6!? was certainly an option.
25.Nf1 Qg8 26.Ne3 Qh7 27.Re1
27...Rhf8
A logical follow-up of Black's plan to bring his queen to the h7-b1 diagonal was to harass White's knight (and accentuate the c2 weakness) with 27...Nf5! 28.Nd1 (28.Ng4 contains Black's kingside counterplay, but it's rather unclear how White should continue; allowing the knight trade is not good here as after 28.Bd1?! Nxe3
29.Rexe3 Rhg8 Black opens up the kingside and has a great game).
analysis diagram Black now has a good choice between repeating moves with 28...Ne7 29.Ne3 (or
29.Bh4 Nf5 30.Bf2) and starting wild complications with 28...g5!? 29.g4! gxf4!
30.gxf5 Qxf5 31.Kh2 Rhg8 32.Bf3 Bxc2 with razor-sharp play (my Stockfish gives
zeroes). Karjakin now makes some smart bishop moves, gaining the upper hand:
28.Bg4!
So as to be able to push ...f6, Black needs to protect his e6-pawn.
28...Rc6 29.Bh4! f6
Having reached an advantageous position, White does not show any ambition now.
30.Re2
Black would have been in an unpleasant situation after 30.Rf1! (White wants to push
31.f5) 30...f5 (30...Qe4 is no fun for Black after 31.f5! exf5 32.Bxf5 Nxf5 33.Rxf5
and White is clearly better, e.g. 33...Rcc8 34.Bf2!) 31.Be2 Rf7 (31...Rc7? blunders into the already mentioned trick 32.Bxe7 Rxe7 33.Nxc4!) and now White makes a good strategic trade: analysis diagram
32.Bxe7! Rxe7 33.Rg3 and Black has a problem as White has a clear plan to open
the structure in his favour, e.g. 33...Nc7 34.Rg6 Rf7 35.g4!.
30...Rf7
Karjakin decides not to show any ambition, which is a pity as this was a strategically very interesting game so far.
31.Qa1
31.Rf2!?, planning the f5 push.
31...Rf8 32.Qb2
32.Rf2!?.
32...Rf7 33.Qa1 Rf8
Draw agreed. No counterplay for Black The diagrammed position is great for White. He has a safe king, f-file pressure, space... Black has no counterplay and no good way to solve the problem of his king in the long term. Closed centre, the plan with ...Nf5 and ...h5 Game 33 Leonid Stein Tigran Petrosian Moscow ch-URS Final & Zonal 1961
1.e4 e6 2.d4 d5 3.Nc3 Bb4 4.e5 c5 5.a3 Bxc3+ 6.bxc3 Ne7 7.Qg4
In the 1960s, the following Black set-up was popular at top level:
7...Nf5 8.Bd3 h5
Big names like Petrosian and Korchnoi had it in their regular repertoire. Black's idea is to build a stable kingside with his Nf5 supported by the pawn on h5 (aimed against White's g4 pawn push). As it will transpire, however, Black's problem is that pawns can't move back, and his kingside will be vulnerable in many cases due to his pawn already being on the h5-square. Leonid Stein slowly improves his position, underlining the deficiencies of Black's set-up. As we will see, Petrosian could have played better but was never close to equality and never had any meaningful counterplay. After this game, Black's set-up disappeared from top-level play.
9.Qf4!
Mikhail Tal, true to his style, applied a more direct approach (albeit a bit chaotic) with 9.Qh3. White wants to push g4, harassing the Nf5 as soon as possible: 9...cxd4
10.Nf3 (10.Bxf5 exf5 11.cxd4 does not bring White any advantage as Black is okay
after 11...h4!) A) 10...Nc6 11.g4!? (Tal loved this approach here; the alternative was 11.cxd4 Ncxd4 12.Nxd4 Nxd4 13.O-O and White has good compensation, among other things because Black's pawn is on h5, making the evacuation of his king more difficult)
11...Nfe7 12.gxh5 with a complicated game, won by White in Tal-Petrosian,
Moscow 1957; B) 10...Qc7 11.Rb1 (Tal insists on the same idea as in his game vs Petrosian (see the comment above); better was the typical sacrifice 11.O-O! dxc3 12.a4 Nc6 13.Ba3 with excellent compensation for White) 11...dxc3 and Tal went for his favourite idea: 12.g4 Ne7 13.gxh5. Now, best for Black was to disturb the Bd3 with 13...b6! (the game Tal-Korchnoi, Riga ch-URS 1958, went 13...Nbc6 and after quite a number of ups and downs was eventually won by Black). 14... Ba6 is an often-seen unpleasant positional threat, and White does not have a good way to stop it as after 14.Qg4 Black gains the upper hand with 14...Nd7 15.Bf4 Nc5.
9...Nc6
A) After 9...Qc7... A1) One game by young Magnus Carlsen went 10.Ne2. Black (Yannick Pelletier) understood that White's positional threat was 11. Bxf5 and correctly responded with
10...Ne7!. White now has little else but to to change the central pawn structure
(similar to Shirov-Polgar in this chapter) and go for 11.dxc5. Black was fine after
11...Nd7 12.O-O Qxe5 the game Carlsen-Pelletier, Biel 2005, later ended in a draw;
A2) White should go for a change in the pawn structure and gets a clear advantage with 10.Bxf5! exf5 11.Ne2 (or immediately 11.Qg3) as Black now has a problem stabilizing his kingside (here it would have been helpful if he had his pawn on h6!)
11...Be6 12.Qg3.
B) Ideas like 9...Ne7? do not make sense here as the situation is not comparable to Carlsen-Pelletier above - White's knight is not on e2. White has different ways to get a clear advantage; for example, 10.dxc5 now works much better than in Carlsen's case above; 10.Nh3 looks very promising as well.
10.Ne2
Stein plans to open the f-file. A good alternative is 10.Nf3, combining two ideas: either, in the right circumstances, taking on dxc5 or on Bxf5. Black has a hard life here: 10...c4 (or 10...Nce7 11.dxc5!)
11.Bxf5 exf5 12.Qg3 and White has different plans here. Black is doomed to passive
defence, hoping to salvage a draw, e.g. 12...Rg8 13.Bg5 Qa5 14.Kd2 Be6 15.a4 Kd7
16.Rhb1.
10...Nce7 11.Ng3 Ng6 12.Qd2 Bd7 13.Rb1
Immediately 13.a4 and then pursuing Stein's game plan was perhaps more accurate. I guess Stein wanted to provoke ...b6 or ...Rb8 so that queenside castling becomes difficult or even impossible for Black.
13...Rb8 14.O-O c4
To take on f5 or to retreat?
15.Be2!
The correct decision. 15.Bxf5 exf5 would not have worked as in the previous comments as Black has consolidated his kingside in this case. Black's considerable problem is that due to his pawn placement on h5, he cannot really say 'pass'.
15...Nxg3
Trying to say 'pass' and playing 15...Qh4 does not solve any of Black's problems:
16.a4! when a logical continuation might be 16...Bxa4 17.Ra1 b5.
analysis diagram Black has grabbed a pawn, but his bishop is out of play.
18.Nxf5! exf5 19.Bf3 Rd8 20.Re1. White has many ideas here, while Black cannot
defend his weaknesses, e.g. 20...Nf8 21.Ba3 Ne6 22.Bd6.
16.fxg3
Black's pawn on h5 will be hanging, so Petrosian tries to resolve the situation.
16...h4
Stein continues to improve his position:
17.Bg4
The silicon brain thinks 17.Qe1 is more precise as Black then has a tough choice: A) 17...hxg3 18.Qxg3 Qh4 leads to a queenless position that is difficult for Black:
19.Qxh4 Rxh4 20.Bg5 Rh8 21.Rf2 Kf8 22.g3 and in the long term Black cannot
hold; B) 17...Ba4 falls under a crushing attack: 18.Qf2 Qe7. analysis diagram White's execution is largely tactical: 19.Bg5! Qxg5 20.Qxf7+ Kd8 21.Qxe6 Qe3+ (21...hxg3 loses to the obvious 22.Qd6+ Kc8 23.Rf7) 22.Rf2! (the final accuracy;
22.Kh1? would ruin White's winning after position 22...hxg3 23.h3 Qxe2 and White
has nothing better than a draw by perpetual check with 24.Rf7 Bc6 25.Qd6+ Ke8
26.Qe6+) 22...hxg3 23.Qd6+ and White wins.Stein's choice looks more logical to
me though.
17...hxg3 18.hxg3 Qe7
This allows White to place his bishop on the a3-f8 diagonal, deciding the battle.
18...Ba4! was necessary, but Black faces a long, passive defense and will probably
still lose in the end.
19.a4!
With White's bishop on the a3-f8 diagonal, Black cannot protect against the threats.
19...Bxa4 20.Ra1 b5 21.Ba3 Qd7 22.Rf2 Rb7
22...Rh7 loses to 23.Raf1 Nh8 24.Qg5 Rb7 and White can choose between the flashy
25.Rf6 and the simple 25.Bh5.
23.Raf1 Qd8 24.Qd1
The threat is 25.Be6 followed by Qg4.
24...Rh6 25.Bc1 Rh7 26.Bxe6!
And Black resigned as 26...fxe6 loses to the obvious 27.Qg4. A beautiful, easy- looking win by Leonid Stein. AI, be it Stockfish, Alpha Zero, Scorpio or some other program, may simply 'close' certain lines in the French (and also in other openings). Next, I will give two games, both with Anand playing White, where the former verdict of 'White has compensation' is likely to change into 'Black players should not enter these positions'. Well-known lines killed by technology Game 34 Viswanathan Anand 2753 Curt Hansen 2610 Middelfart 2003 Modern technologies (engines, the cloud...) are going to 'close' some of the sharp tactical lines in the Winawer. Here is an example of a variation played by Botvinnik (as Black) in two different World Championship matches (meaning that he and his team analysed it a lot!) against Tal in 1960 and 1961. In the next game, Anand- Nikolic, we will see some more examples of technological advances probably 'killing' well-known lines played by very strong players.
1.e4 e6 2.d4 d5 3.Nc3 Bb4 4.e5 c5 5.a3 Bxc3+ 6.bxc3 Qc7 7.Qg4 f5 8.Qg3 Ne7
9.Qxg7 Rg8 10.Qxh7 cxd4
This variation became well known after the Tal-Botvinnik matches (1960 and 1961). White won both games; however, Black's play could have been improved). Anand's dynamic play in this game is the product of 'modern support'. Computer engines (see also Anand-Nikolic) on behalf of White here, as the position has been opened and White's bishop pair is a great force.
11.Ne2!
11.Kd1 was Tal's choice in both matches.
11...Nbc6 12.Qh5+
This leads to White's advantage, however White also had a rather good alternative. White's h-pawn is a force here while putting it on h4 also enables the development of his rook to h3, so a good alternative was 12.h4 Nxe5 (12...Qxe5? is wrong as after the relatively simple 13.Bf4 Rh8 - or 13...Qf6 14.Bg5 - 14.Qxe7+ Kxe7 15.Bxe5 Nxe5 16.cxd4 White is a sound pawn up and has a technically winning position)
13.cxd4 Nf7 (Black has a drawing threat with ...Rh8, ...Rg8) 14.Qh5! Qxc2 (material
is equal, however White's h-passer now becomes very annoying) 15.Qf3 Bd7 16.h5 Bb5 17.h6 and the position is sharp but better for White.
12...Ng6
13.Bg5?!
An inaccuracy. The precise move was 13.h4! and here White is better prepared for a tactical battle after 13...dxc3 (13...d3? 14.cxd3 Ncxe5 is now simply wrong due to the obvious
15.Rh3+-) 14.Rh3.
13...Qxe5?!
Black does not take his chance. He could have obtained excellent counterplay with 13...d3! 14.cxd3 Ncxe5 with an unclear game, e.g. 15.Qh3 f4. Anand is now in his element and plays a great game:
14.f4! Qg7 15.h4!
This move is almost always good for White in such positions. Rh3 is enabled, Bg5 is extra protected, and pushing the h-pawn further can throw Black off balance.
15...dxc3 16.Rd1
Black is temporarily a pawn up, however he has one huge problem: his king! White's Bg5 is excellently placed, making the evacuation of Black's king impossible. Also, Black's extra pawn is likely to fall (to Rh3 followed by Nxc3). Black attemps to create counterplay by using his central pawns:
16...d4
If 16...Bd7, White is clearly better after 17.Rh3 Rc8 18.Nxc3 (Stockfish's first line, first securing the king and then grabbing the c3-pawn, also makes a lot of sense:
18.Kf2 Kf7 19.Kg1) 18...Nd4 19.Rd2 Nb3 20.cxb3 Rxc3 21.Qe2 and Black's king is
badly placed while the h-pawn push will disturb his coordination.
17.Qf3! e5
In case of 17...Bd7 White gets a large advantage with 18.h5 Nge5 19.Qg3 Nf7 20.h6. Black's biggest problem is his king. Anand executes with great precision:
18.Qd5! Nge7 19.Qd6 Bd7
19...Qf7 lands Black in a lost ending: 20.fxe5 Rg6 21.Bf6 Nxe5 22.Qxe5 Qxf6
23.Qxd4 Qxd4 24.Rxd4.
The time has come for the final execution. Vishy sacrifices a piece to open routes to the black king:
20.Nxc3! Nc8 21.Qc7 dxc3
Not accepting sacrifice was not really an option as Black's position quickly collapses after 21...Be6 22.Qxg7 Rxg7 23.Ne2. Black's Rg8 is now directed to h8, so that the Qg7 will be unprotected.
22.Be2! Rh8 23.fxe5
The simple threat is 24.e6.
23...Qf7
23...Nxe5? loses to 24.Qd8+ Kf7 25.Rxd7+, while in case of 23...Qh7 White can win
with a motif similar to the game: 24.Bh5+ Qxh5 25.Qxd7+ Kf8 26.Qxf5+ Kg8 27.0- 0. Anand finishes with a flourish:
24.Bc4! Qxc4 25.Qxd7+ Kf8 26.Qxf5+ Ke8
Or 26...Qf7 27.Qg4.
27.Qd7+
Black resigned; he did not care to wait for 28.Rf1+. Minor sacrifices - pawn sacrifice for development Game 35 Viswanathan Anand 2765 Predrag Nikolic 2630 Groningen FIDE Wch KO 1997 This game is a good example of the influence AI will have on certain variations and concepts. Predrag Nikolic is a strong GM who has played risky lines in the French Winawer over the years against the very world top, and took some rather 'poisoned' pawns. Twenty-five years ago, the verdict was that White had compensation and Black is taking a considerable risk snatching such a pawn. Today's verdict will be: 'Black is playing a losing variation'. Any player with a good feeling for the initiative, armed with a strong 'second' (read Stockfish or any other top engine) has a good chance to simply 'close' most of these lines. In most cases, a pawn sacrifice for the initiative in the type of lines we will see in this game, is worth considerably more than just 'compensation'. Let's study a couple of examples.
1.e4 e6 2.d4 d5 3.Nc3 Bb4 4.e5 c5 5.a3 Bxc3+ 6.bxc3
Now Black attempts to avoid mainstream theory:
6...Qa5
Another attempt to avoid theory is 6...Ne7 7.Qg4 Kf8?! (the main moves are 7...O-O and the nowadays most often played 7...Qc7). Playing this move, depriving himself from his castling rights, Black banks on the closed nature of the position. The problem is that in case the position opens up, his weak king and poor development will play a major role while any extra pawn Black may collect in the process will have merely psychological importance: 8.h4 and now: A) In case of 8...Qa5 we have a relatively recent top game in which the White player was well prepared: 9.Bd2 Qa4
10.Rh3! - the standard way for White to develop an initiative in such positions
10...Nbc6 (the pawn snatch 10...Qxc2? is bad due to the simple 11.Bd3 Qa4 12.Rg3
g6 13.Nh3 and Black comes under a crushing attack) 11.h5 h6 12.Qf4 Ke8 (White is certainly happy if Black plays 12...cxd4 13.Rf3). White now changes the character of the position and forces a favourable ending with
13.dxc5! (in this type of position Black should watch out for such changes in the
pawn structure!) 13...Qxf4 14.Bxf4. White has tripled c-pawns, however one of them is a plus pawn. White is clearly better. Black hopes to create counterplay with 14...f6
15.Nf3 g5 16.hxg6 Nxg6 17.Rxh6 Rxh6 18.Bxh6 fxe5 19.Rb1 and White had an
advantage and went on to win in Nisipeanu-Suleymanli, Reykjavik Ech 2021. Perhaps even stronger was 17.Bh2 Ngxe5 18.Nxe5 Nxe5 19.Bxe5 fxe5 20.c4! and Black has problems: his pawn centre is shaky while his rooks are not coordinated:
20...Bd7 (or 20...Ke7 21.O-O-O) 21.cxd5 exd5 22.Rh5;
B) 8...Qc7. Now we have a standard pawn sac: 9.Rh3!. This is a strong move, almost a novelty, that probably closes the variation. White sacrifices a pawn under very good circumstances. An old pawn sacrifice that was once considered the 'main line' (in this sideline) is
9.Qd1 cxd4 10.cxd4 Qc3+ 11.Bd2 Qxd4 12.Nf3 Qe4+ 13.Be2 b6. White's sacrificial
idea is similar to Anand's in our main game (considerably less convincing here, however, as Black's pawn is still on g7!). White had compensation at this stage of the game but probably not more, and went on to win in Kasparov-Nikolic, Horgen 1994. B1) One of the very few games we have with 9.Rh3! went 9...b6 10.h5 h6 11.Rf3 cxd4 12.cxd4 Nf5 13.Qf4! (the obvious threat is 14.g4; the game we have went 13.c3 Ba6 14.Ne2. White is clearly better here as well, but later he messed it up and lost in Plazuelo Pascual-Moskalenko, Barcelona 2021) 13...Qxc2 14.g4 and now forcing an ending does not save Black: analysis diagram
14...Qe4+ 15.Qxe4 dxe4 16.Rc3 Ne7 17.a4 with Ba3 to follow, with a large
advantage for White as Black cannot coordinate his pieces; B2) If Black is to suffer, he might as well explore the pawn grab: 9...cxd4 10.cxd4 Qxc2 when a logical further continuation might be 11.h5 h6 12.Ne2 Nbc6 13.Nc3 (Black's only counterplay here is the attack on the d4-pawn) 13...Nf5 14.a4 Nfxd4 (14...Ncxd4 runs into 15.Ba3+ Kg8 16.Rc1 Qb3 17.Ne4 and White wins) 15.Ba3+ Kg8 16.Rg3 and now: analysis diagram B21) 16...Rh7 17.Rd1 Nf5 18.Rd2 Qb3 19.Nxd5 wins for White; B22) 16...Qh7 looks terribly ugly and loses in various ways: 17.Bd3 Nf5 18.Qf4 (18.Qe2 should win as well) 18...Bd7 19.Rb1! (provoking ...b6 proves advantageous for White here) 19...b6 20.Rf3. So as not to lose a piece to 21.g4, Black has to play
20...g5 but now he loses for a different reason: 21.hxg6 fxg6 22.Bxf5! gxf5 23.Rg3+
Kf7 24.Qh4 Rag8 25.Qf6+ Ke8 26.Nb5 and Black gets mated, e.g. 26...Bc8 27.Rc1 Kd7 28.Rgc3!.
7.Bd2 Qa4 8.Qg4
White's main move here. Black is now forced to either weaken his kingside by playing 8...g6 or give up castling by playing 8...Kf8:
8...g6
This move is less often played, because the weakened dark squares on the kingside prove difficult for Black to deal with. 8...Kf8 is arguably the better of two unpleasant choices.
9.Qd1
Anand takes a typical decision, judging that the weakening of Black's kingside is worth two tempi. The text also 'invites' Black to accept the pawn sacrifice.
9.h4 is a typical alternative, played in a number of top games.
In case of 9.Nf3, Black closes the centre with 9...c4, hoping to get something similar to the game Saric-Bartel (in case of 9...Nc6 10.Qf4 h6, like Nisipeanu in the comments above, White can orchestrate a favourable change in the central pawn structure and obtain an advantage with 11.dxc5 as in Karjakin-Zhang, Khanty- Mansiysk 2007). But now we have 'AI at work' more or less closing the line: 10.Kd1! (10.Be2 was played, for example, in Grandelius-Merry, Douglas 2015). This idea, which was novel at the moment of writing, has an interesting tactical motif behind it: A) 10...Nc6 11.h4 h6 12.h5 g5 analysis diagram and now comes tactical idea behind 10.Kd1!: 13.Bxg5! hxg5 14.Qxg5. The position looks complicated?... hmmm... not exactly if you were helped in your preparation by a silicon friend. White has a large advantage, e.g. 14...Qa5 15.Qg7 Qxc3 16.Ra2 or
14...Nge7 15.Qf6 Rf8 16.h6 Qa5 17.Kd2;
B) If Black suspects White's tactical idea and goes for 10...Qa5, White gets a clear advantage with 11.h4 h6 12.Nh2! Bd7 13.h5 g5 14.Qf3 (White has to watch out not to fall for the typical motif 14.f4? f5!) 14...Nc6 15.Ng4 and White has a 'free roll'; C) 10...Bd7 fails to the same tactical motif as 10...Nc6 in line A: 11.h4 h6 12.h5 g5
13.Bxg5! hxg5 14.Qxg5 with Qg7 to follow and White wins (note the importance of
10.Kd1 - the pawn on c2 is protected!)
9...cxd4?
Risky and wrong. White gets much more than just compensation for his sacrificed pawn... not even taking into account that Vishy Anand is one of the worst possible opponents on the planet to face in such a position! Closing the center with 9...c4? does not help Black here as White has 10.h4 h6
11.h5! g5 12.f4!. Had White's queen been placed on g4, then Black would have
12...f5 here, but as it is, Black is in terrible trouble.
Best was 9...b6, though White has an advantage after 10.h4.
10.Rb1
How to assess this pawn sacrifice? Well, at the time game was played, it would have been something like: 'Black has made a very risky choice, White has sufficient compensation at least, and most probably more'. The assessment of today: 'Black is more or less lost, White is close to plus two'.
10...d3
10...a6 11.cxd4 Qxd4 12.Nf3 does not change much.
11.Bxd3 Qxa3 12.Nf3
For his sacrificed pawn, White has a massive development advantage , and the dark squares on Black's kingside are weakened. It may sound a bit over the top, but in a higher sense White has a winning advantage here. Anand goes on to play a nice attacking game crowned by an elegant execution. Yes, there are moments when White could have played better - more accurate perhaps, but Black never really gets a chance to escape.
12...Qc5 13.h4 h6 14.O-O Nd7 15.Re1 a6
Time to open up the position.
16.c4! dxc4 17.Be4
Black wants to stop 18.Bb4.
17...c3 18.Be3 Qc4 19.Bd4 Nc5
Vishy decides for arguably the most logical human move:
20.Re3
My Stockfish has an interesting idea: 20.Bxc5 Qxc5 21.Re3 Ne7 22.h5! g5 and now the Ne7 proves to be badly placed after 23.Qd6! Qxd6 24.exd6 and White has a winning advantage, e.g. 24...Nc6 25.Rxc3.
20...Nxe4 21.Rxe4 Bd7 22.Re3 Ne7
22...Bc6 does not help as White gets a winning advantage with 23.Rxc3 Qd5 24.Rd3
Qd8 (or 24...Bb5 25.Rd2) 25.Bb6 Qe7 26.Rd6.
23.Rxc3 Qd5 24.Rc5! Qe4 25.Rc7 b5 26.Bc5
A logical, human decision, not letting anything go. Your computer engine will tell you that the alternatives 26.Rb4 and 26.Nh2 are even stronger.
26...Nd5?
This allows an elegant finish. 26...Qd5 was more stubborn, but it does not save the game: 27.Qe1 Rc8. analysis diagram A) Now the most human solution is quite efficient: 28.Rxc8+ Bxc8 29.Bxe7 Kxe7
30.Qb4+ Ke8 31.Rb3 and Black simply cannot coordinate his pieces - the Rh8 is
doomed; B) The silicon brain suggests as the most precise 28.Bxe7 Rxc7 (or 28...Kxe7
29.Rd1 Rxc7 30.Rxd5 exd5 31.Qb4+ with a winning advantage as Black cannot
coordinate his rooks) 29.Bf6 Rg8 30.Rd1 and Black's position collapses.
27.Rxd7!
An elegant 'petite combinaison à la Capablanca' nets a queen.
27...Kxd7 28.Rb4
The rest of the game does not require any comment.
28...Qxb4 29.Bxb4 Rhc8 30.Bd6 Rc4 31.Nd2 Rd4 32.c3 Rd3 33.c4 Rxd2 34.Qxd2
bxc4 35.Qxh6 1-0 Tripled pawns for White This position type was hotly debated in the final Candidates Match between Spassky and Korchnoi in 1977. White has ugly pawns, but one of them is 'extra'. This semi- open position may also favour White's bishop pair. The battle is strategically very complex. I would rather be White, but in the mentioned match Korchnoi was quite successful as Black. White changes the central pawn structure with dxc5 Game 36 Alexei Shirov 2740 Zsuzsa Polgar 2550 Pardubice 1994
1.e4 e6 2.d4 d5 3.Nc3 Bb4 4.e5 c5 5.a3 Bxc3+ 6.bxc3 Ne7 7.Nf3
One of White's main choices versus the Winawer. As mentioned throughout the chapters of this book, where I find it relevant to provide useful information about opening theory, I do. But this is a middlegame book, so this game serves to show a frequently seen change in the central pawn structure caused by White taking dxc5.
7...Bd7
Black has tried many moves here, and readers interested in theory should also study
7...Qc7, 7...Nbc6, 7...b6 and 7...Qa5 - all lines that are played by (many) top players.
So any reader/player interested in opening theory has a lot of work to do here.
8.dxc5
White voluntarily creates 'Irish pawns' for himself, so what does he get in return? First of all, one of those pawns is an extra pawn, and secondly the position gets an open character, which should benefit White's bishop pair. Black gets one of his pawns back (collecting either the e5- or the c5-pawn), but this opens diagonals for White's dark squared bishop. This particular line was hotly debated in quite a number of games in the Spassky-Korchnoi Candidates match in 1977 and I advise any reader who is willing to broaden their knowledge of this type of position to go through those games.
8...Qc7
Black wants to place her bishop on a4 and then develop her knight to c6. The immediate 8...Nbc6, intending to take White's e5-pawn, was played in a number of top (rapid) games: 9.Bd3 Ng6 10.Rb1 (10.O-O leads to equality; after 10...Ncxe5
11.Nxe5 Nxe5 12.Bf4 Qf6 we have an approximately equal opposite-coloured
bishops position: 13.Qd2 Nxd3 14.cxd3 d4 15.c4 O-O 16.Bd6 Rfe8 17.f4 Bc6 with a later draw in Shirov-Nikolic, Monte Carlo 1995) 10...Ncxe5 and now: A) 11.Nxe5 Nxe5 12.Rxb7 leads to equality after 12...Qc8, but when Black in a classical time control game gave a 'healthy pawn' to reach a position with opposite- coloured bishops with 12...O-O? 13.Bxh7+ Kxh7 14.Qh5+ Kg8 15.Qxe5 f6 16.Qg3, he probably hoped that he would hold it despite the two-pawn deficit, but he blunders a full piece: 16...e5?? (16...Rf7 was needed) 17.c6 1-0 Beliavsky-Uhlmann, Sarajevo 1982; B) Anand wanted to create dynamics, and a possibility to throw in the h4-h5 push at the moment of his choosing, with 11.h4: 11...Qc7 12.O-O. An interesting situation! To take on d3 and improve White's pawn structure, or to take on f3 and grab a pawn on h4? Black goes for the latter: 12...Nxf3+? (correct was
12...Nxd3 13.cxd3 f6 and White has just a slight advantage at best) 13.Qxf3 Nxh4
14.Qg3!.
Most probably, Black did not take this option seriously enough as White's pawn structure now looks horrible: 14...Qxg3 15.fxg3 Ng6 16.Rxb7. White has a terrible pawn structure, but his rook on the 7th is a tremendous force here. White has a clear advantage and went on to win in Anand-Nikolic, Monte Carlo 1995.
9.Bd3 Ba4 10.Rb1
A useful move: the rook is on an open file plus White has Rb4 ideas.
10.O-O and 10.Be3 were tried in the mentioned Candidates match Spassky-Korchnoi,
Belgrade 1977.
10...Nec6
Polgar wants to hit the e5-pawn while stopping Rb4 ideas.
10...Nd7...
allows the rook lift 11.Rb4!, and ideed after 11...Bc6 12.O-O Nxc5 (12...Nxe5? is a bad idea as Black's queen gets exposed and it loses too much time: 13.Nxe5 Qxe5
14.Re1 Qc7 (14...Qxc3 15.Bb2) 15.Bf4+-) 13.Rg4 and White had an initiative and
the advantage, though Black eventually emerged victorious in Spassky-Korchnoi, Belgrade 1977.
11.O-O Nd7 12.Be3 h6
White has the advantage here, but this time loss will prove important.
12...Ndxe5 is wrong due to the simple 13.Nxe5 Nxe5 14.Bf4 and Black does not
have a satisfactory way to solve the pin problem. Black's best was the immediate 12...O-O-O when White should go for the game idea
13.Rb4! Nxb4 14.axb4, but here Black's survival chances are better than in the
game.
13.Re1 O-O-O
Black did not have much choice as after 13...O-O? White removes the pawn defences in front of Black's king by means of a piece sacrifice: 14.Qd2 Ncxe5 15.Nxe5 Nxe5 analysis diagram
16.Bxh6! Nxd3 17.cxd3. White now threatens a double rook lift and has a winning
attack; for example, 17...f6 18.Re3. Shirov now executes a thematic exchange sacrifice to improve his pawn structure:
14.Rb4! Nxb4 15.axb4 a6 16.Nd4
White has a clear advantage here and easy play. He has sacrificed only a pawn, so his attack is almost 'free of charge', combined with central domination and a queenside pawn roll. Black is in bad shape here. Polgar does her best to regroup and put up a defence.
16...Nb8! 17.Qa1 Bc6
18.f4 g6 19.Bf2 Rhg8 20.Rb1 Kd7 21.Bh4 Rc8 22.Bf6 Ke8
23.b5
White is in a hurry to win. The prophylactic king move (similar to Kasparov-Short earlier in this chapter) was perhaps the best practical execution: 23.Kh1!. White's b4-b5 push will now come with more power (as Black doesn't have the ...Qxc5 check) and Black doesn't have a good defence, e.g. 23...Nd7 24.b5 axb5 25.Nxb5 Bxb5 26.Bxb5 Qxc5 (26...Kf8 loses to 27.Bxd7! Qxd7 28.Qa7 Rc7 and Black's king is boxed in and his Rg8 is hopelessly placed; 29.Rb6) 27.Qa4 Qc7 analysis diagram Black is under a deadly pin. White now easily wins by opening the position further with 28.c4! and Black's position collapses.
23...axb5 24.Nxb5
Since Black doesn't have any useful moves, the silicon brain prefers to improve White's position before capturing on b5 with 24.Qa7!.
24...Bxb5 25.Bxb5+
25...Nc6
The only way to stay in the game was 25...Kf8! with ...Rg7 to follow. Yes, White is better but he would still need to 'bring it home'. Now White's queen enters forcefully, the terrible position of Rg8 tells, and the game is over:
26.Qa7! Kd7 27.Bxc6+ Qxc6 28.Rb6! Qxc5+ 29.Kh1
White has two terrible threats: 30.Rxb7+ and 30.Rd6+, and sadly Black has to move her king back to e8, disconnecting the rooks.
29...Ke8 30.Qxb7 Rc7 31.Qa6
Black does not get the time to threaten perpetual check or something similar.
31...Rc8
32.Qa4+! Kf8 33.Rb7
The threat is 34.Rxf7.
33...Rg7 34.Qd7 1-0
Chapter 6 Italian, Petroff, Ruy Lopez For the huge area of 1...e5 systems, I have opted for examples that were likely to occur in the reader's practical play, coming from the often-played openings the Italian, the Petroff, and the Ruy Lopez. The 'Italian Dilemma' White's Bh4 pin is annoying for Black, and the most clear-cut way to solve it is a radical one - pushing ...g5. The problem, next to the weakening of the kingside, is that White may sacrifice a piece on g5. Most of the time, this is easy to calculate, but it may simply work for White. After facing (and not successfully solving) this dilemma often in my career with Black, I ended up playing ...h6 most of the time, to stop the annoying Bg5 pin. A typical Italian sacrifice We have an instructive recent top-level game (and one in the comments) where the piece sacrifice on g5 works excellently for White. Game 37 Anish Giri 2768 Ding Liren 2788 Bucharest 2023
1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bc4 Nf6
Probably Anish was inspired by the following game played by Magnus Carlsen six years prior: 3...Bc5 4.c3 Nf6 5.d3 O-O 6.Bg5. This standard pin is a bit unpleasant for Black. Like in our main game, the pin cannot really be ignored. Retreating bishop to e7 looks a bit passive, while the most radical way (chasing White's bishop away by pushing ...g7-g5) gives White tactical possibilities like in our main game.
6...d6 (due to his pawn still being on d7, Black can opt for 6...h6 7.Bh4 Be7 with
play similar to the recent game Yu Yangyi-Dardha - see the comment to 6...d6 below)
7.Nbd2! (a well-thought-out move-order. By delaying castling, as Anish will also do
in our main games, White keeps sacrificial possibilities on g5, while by defending his e4-pawn he also - sort of - rules out Black's ...Ne7 plan solving the pin on the h4-d8 diagonal. In case of 7.O-O, Black has a well-known plan to solve the pin by playing 7...Ne7!. Black wants to play ...Ng6 with ...h6 to follow, and is not worried about the doubling of his f-pawns: 8.d4 Bb6 and now, compared to 7.Nbd2!, White's e4-pawn is hanging. After 9.Nbd2 Black plays 9...Ng6 with ...h6 to follow, while after 9.Bxf6 gxf6, Black's bishop pair, the open g-file (for Rg8) and the potential ...f6-f5 pawn push compensate for the doubling of the f-pawns) 7...h6 (now, the unpinning 7...Ne7 does not work as White's e4-pawn is defended and White gets a stable advantage after the simple 8.d4. Black is forced to make a concession, giving up the centre with 8...exd4 - with the e4-pawn defended, 8...Bb6? now simply drops a pawn after 9.dxe5 dxe5 10.Nxe5 Qd6 11.Nd3 - 9.cxd4 Bb6 10.Bxf6 gxf6 11.O-O and White has a pleasant advantage) 8.Bh4. Now, Karjakin opts for the most radical way to solve the annoying pin: 8...g5
9.Nxg5! If I remember correctly, when watching this game live, Magnus was still
blitzing out his moves here. He goes for a well-known tactical theme (though it was at the time a novelty in this particular position), and was most probably still in his opening preparation. Karjakin now took his time (interestingly enough, he had underestimated this known sacrificial idea just like Ding) 9...hxg5 10.Bxg5. As the usual result of this thematic sacrifice, White has already grabbed two pawns for the knight, while Black is still far from solving the annoying pin) 10...Kg7 (10...Be6
11.Qf3 Kg7 transposes to the text) 11.Qf3 Be6 (nowadays, theoretical preparation
has advanced to lower-section Olympiad teams and at the Chennai 2022 Olympiad we saw 11...Rh8 12.Nf1 (12.O-O-O is a better execution) 12...Na5 (12...Be6 transposes to 11...Be6 12.Nf1 Rh8) 13.Ne3 Nxc4? (13...c6! was necessary) 14.Nd5 Nxd5 15.Bxd8 Rxd8 16.exd5 and later White won in Mwadzura-Montes Orozco, Chennai 2022). White has a big advantage here, however the execution is far from easy, even for a World Champion. White can successfully capitalize on his pin and gain a full point, but precision is needed. Flashy Stockfish or other top engine assessments are not easy to prove in a human game. Magnus went on to get an advantage, but did not derive the most from it and Karjakin ultimately escaped with a draw: A) 12.b4 Bb6
13.Bd5!. An unpleasant move! The 13...Bxd5 14. exd5 transaction is not really an
option here, as White will get a great outpost on e4 for his Nd2, while the standard ...Nb8-bd7 plan will cost a pawn on b7. Karjakin goes for the best defense: 13...a5!
14.b5 Nb8 15.Bxb7 (White got a third pawn for his knight while the pin on the h4-d8
diagonal still persists) 15...Ra7 (Black's most precise defence was 15...Nbd7! and after 16.Bc6! (White should not be greedy as after 16.Bxa8 Qxa8 the h4-d8 pin has been solved while Black's pieces start to coordinate nicely) 16...Rh8 17.h4 Qf8
18.Nc4 Rc8. White has three pawns for a piece and clear pressure, but Black has
decent survival chances). A1) 16.Bd5 was a logical move, but not the best: 16...Nbd7 17.Nc4 Bxd5 18.exd5 Qe8 (other options were 18...Rg8 or 18...Rh8). The pin has finally been solved! White has pressure, and Black was certainly not out of the woods yet, but Karjakin defended well and the game ended in a draw, Carlsen- Karjakin, Wijk aan Zee 2017; A2) Strongest for White was 16.Bc6!, insisting on eliminating the Nb8 and making it harder for Black to solve the pin. Black is in big trouble, e.g.: A21) 16...Bd7? does not work after 17.h4! Nxc6 (17...Rh8 18.Nc4+-) 18.bxc6 Bxc6 19.Rh3 with Rg3 to follow, with a winning advantage for White; A22) In case of 16...Nxc6 17.bxc6, the only way to get out of the pin here is by giving an exchange: 17...Rh8. Now White takes space: 18.d4! Rh6 (18...exd4?? blunders into 19.e5 dxe5 20.Ne4) 19.Bxh6+ Kxh6 20.d5 Bg4 21.Qg3 and White has a material and positional advantage and should win; A23) 16...Nbd7 17.Bxd7 Bxd7. Here it looks to me that the most logical human continuation is 18.h4 (my Stockfish wants me to play 18.Nc4 Bxb5 19.h4 and says White has a winning advantage) when Black tries to solve the pin with 18...Qe7: analysis diagram
19.h5! and the next couple of moves look forced: 19...Qe6 20.h6+ Kg6 21.h7! Kxg5
22.h8R Rxh8 23.Rxh8 Qg4 24.Ke2. Black's pieces have no coordination - the Ra7 is
hopelessly out of play. White should win this, e.g. 24...Bxb5 25.Rah1 Bd7 26.R8h6; B) The best execution was 12.Nf1!, provided that White is precise. analysis diagram Black cannot solve his problems here: B1) 12...Bxf2+? does not really help as after 13.Ke2! (13.Kxf2? is wrong due to the simple 13...Nxe4+ 14.dxe4 Qxg5) Black has won a pawn but has opened the f-file, so White now easily gets a decisive advantage, e.g. 13...Bb6 14.h4 Rh8 15.Nh2. The open f-file indeed comes in handy for White here, and the only way for Black to resist a bit longer is 15...Nb8 16.Raf1 Nbd7; however, Black loses material after the simple 17.Bxe6 fxe6 18.Ng4 Rf8 19.Bh6+ Kh7 20.Bxf8 Qxf8 21.Nxf6+; B2) Black's best defence is to improve the knight and rook: 12...Nb8 13.Ng3 Rh8. analysis diagram Here White has an important idea that will be repeated in the main Giri-Ding game:
14.Nf5+! Bxf5 (14...Kg6? is out of the question due to the simple 15.h4) 15.Qxf5
Nbd7 and the combination of the h4-d8 pin plus pressure on the f-file (the f7-square) proves decisive here. White opens files and gets his piece back with a winning advantage: 16.O-O-O Qe7 17.h4 Rag8 18.d4! exd4 (or 18...Bb6 19.f4+-) 19.cxd4. Black is forced to give his piece back: 19...Qxe4 (or 19...Bb6 20.Rhe1) 20.Bxf6+ Nxf6 21.Qg5+ Qg6 22.Qxg6+ Kxg6 23.dxc5 with a winning advantage for White.
4.d3 Bc5 5.Bg5 h6 6.Bh4
6...d6
With the pawn still on d7, one thematic way for Black to solve the pin problem is
6...Be7. At the moment of writing, we have one recent top-level game that went
7.Bg3 (strategically Black is happy with the trade after 7.O-O d6 8.a4 Nh5 9.Bxe7
Qxe7=) 7...d6 8.a4 O-O 9.Nbd2 (counterplay for Black? Push the f-pawn!) 9...Kh8! (given that Black has a change of heart in a few moves, he could have opted for the immediate 9...g6 10.a5 a6 11.O-O Nh5) 10.a5 a6 11.c3
11...g6!?. Not a mistake, however I don't like Black's unnecessary mixing of plans.
Black wants to play ...Nh5 but has weakened his kingside. 11...Nh7 is perhaps not precise because White probably has some advantage after 12.Qb3 f5 13.exf5 Rxf5
14.O-O, but consistent and strong was 11...Ng8!. Black has active counterplay and is
not worse, e.g. 12.Qb3 (or 12.d4 f5) 12...f5 13.exf5 Bf6! with ...Nge7 to follow. After 11...g6, White takes central action: 12.d4 exd4 13.cxd4. Black reacts correctly:
13...Nxe4 14.Nxe4 d5 15.Bxd5 Qxd5 16.Nc3 Qc4 17.d5 Re8 18.dxc6.
A tough decision: which check should Black give? 18...Bf6+ (18...Bb4+! was stronger when after 19.Ne5 f6 20.Qd2 Kg7 21.O-O-O fxe5 we have an unclear, dynamically balanced game) 19.Ne2 Bg4 20.O-O Qxe2. White has an advantage here, but does not play accurately: 21.cxb7 Qxd1. Now after 22.Rfxd1 Rab8 23.Ra4 Bxf3
24.gxf3 Rxb7 the endgame was drawish, but thanks to a few mistakes by Black
White managed to win in Yu Yangyi-Dardha, Sharjah 2023. The double attack on Black's f7- and b7-pawns would have yielded White an advantage: 21.Qb3! Qe6 (or 21...Bxf3 22.gxf3 bxc6 23.Qxf7) 22.Qxb7.
7.c3 a5
I assume that further theoretical discussions will be in the direction of 7...g5 8.Bg3 a6 9.Nbd2 Ba7 as in Giri-Keymer, Wijk aan Zee 2023.
8.Nbd2 Ba7
Probably inspired by Magnus's game, Anish keeps delaying his kingside castling:
9.a4!
We have had 9.O-O g5 in a couple of top-level games.
9...O-O
If Black wanted to push his g-pawn, it was a good idea to do it now. For example,
9...g5 10.Bg3 Qe7.
10.h3!
Similar to Karjakin, Ding Liren now goes for a radical solution to the h4-d8 pin problem:
10...g5
If Black plays 10...Qe7, we see another idea behind 10.h3: 11.g4! and Black is in trouble: 11...g5 12.Bg3 (12.Nxg5!? comes into consideration even here) 12...Kg7
13.Qe2 Be6 14.O-O-O! with h4 to follow. White has a strong attack - Black may
collapse in a few moves. Probably Black's best option was 10...Be6 and after 11.g4 (11.Nh2!? is another plan to consider) 11...Bxc4 12.dxc4 (12.Nxc4 leads to an equal ending after 12...d5!
13.exd5 Qxd5 14.Bxf6 e4! 15.dxe4 Qxe4+ 16.Qe2 Rfe8 17.Qxe4 Rxe4+ 18.Kf1
Rxc4 and a draw is the most likely result) 12...g5! 13.Bg3 Qd7. analysis diagram I prefer White here, but my Stockfish gives me zeroes after 14.Qe2 Ne7 15.O-O-O Ng6! (15...Qxa4? is not a good idea as White is fast with his attack after 16.h4)
16.h4 Kg7 17.hxg5 hxg5 18.Nxg5 Rh8 with apparent equality.
11.Nxg5!
Bingo! Giri gets a Carlsen-Karjakin kind of situation.
11...hxg5 12.Bxg5 Kg7 13.Qf3 Be6
Similar to Carlsen-Karjakin, White should emerge victorious here with precise play, but it's not easy! Like Carlsen, Giri does not execute in the most precise way and gives his opponent a chance to escape. Probably still in his home prep, Anish started with a precise move:
14.Nf1! Rh8
Another logical way to defend was 14...Nb8 when after 15.Ng3 Rh8 16.Nf5+! Bxf5
17.Qxf5 Nbd7 we reach a situation similar to what could have happened in Carlsen-
Karjakin: the h4-d8 pin combined with pressure on the f-file (the f7-square) should prove decisive. White opens files and gets a winning advantage with 18.h4. 18.Rf1 is also good, and 18.O-O-O should also work well for White.
15.Ne3
Black has different options to try to solve his problems but, provided White plays accurately, none of them seems to work.
15...Qe7
15...Nb8 16.Nf5+! transposes to lines given in the previous comment.
If Black removes White's annoying knight with 15...Bxe3 then White takes advantage of the open f-file: 16.fxe3 Nb8 (16...Bxc4 doesn't work due to 17.O-O)
17.O-O Nbd7 18.Qg3! and White wins: 18...Nh5 19.Bxe6 Nxg3 20.Rxf7+ Kg6
21.Bxd8.
A different order of capturing with 15...Bxc4 does not work either due to 16.Ng4!. Black prevents an immediate annihilation with 16...Bxf2+ 17.Nxf2 Be6, but the f- file and the pin now prove decisive: 18.O-O Kg6 19.h4 Nb8 20.d4 and White should win. Giri has the right idea but does not execute in the most precise way:
16.O-O-O
More accurate was to 'pro-actively' start the pressure on the f-file with 16.Rf1!. Black has nothing better than 16...Nb8 and now White goes for the already mentioned idea 17.Nf5+! Bxf5 18.Qxf5 Nbd7 19.O-O-O and he will push f4, opening the f-file. Black can't get out of the pin or create real counterplay, e.g. 19...c6 20.Kc2 (removing his king from the ...Be3 check; now White is ready to push f4) 20...b5
21.Ba2 bxa4 22.f4 and Black cannot defend against White's multiple threats.
The immediate 16.Nf5+ is not clear as after 16...Bxf5 17.Qxf5 Black has 17...Nd8! with ...Ne6 to follow.
16...Rag8
Ding Liren does not take his chance. If the f-file is now opened, White does not have an imminent threat, so this was the moment for Black to remove White's knight: A) 16...Bxe3+! 17.fxe3 Nb8. Black is on time now, and we probably have a dynamic balance: 18.Rhf1 Nbd7. analysis diagram The position is tense, and it is easy to go wrong, White needs to be smart to keep the balance here! A1) 19.Qg3 is wrong due to 19...Nh5!; A2) 19.Rf2 does not work in view of 19...Bxc4 20.dxc4 Qe6! 21.Rdf1 Nh7 and Black wins, e.g. 22.Qg3 (or 22.Qxf7+ Qxf7 23.Rxf7+ Kg6) 22...Nxg5 23.Qxg5+ Kf8 24.Rxf7+ Qxf7 25.Rxf7+ Kxf7 and Black has too many pieces for the queen; A3) After 19.Bd5! the engine gives zeroes, while in case of 19...c6 (also possible is
19...Rh7 or 19...Kg6) we see the reason why White inserted 19.Bd5! as now 20.Qg3!
leads to a balanced position: 20...Nh5 (alternative, Black can go for an interesting, materially unbalanced position with 20...Kf8!? 21.Rxf6 Nxf6 22.Qf3 Nxd5!
23.Bxe7+ Nxe7 with unclear play) 21.Bxe7+ Nxg3 22.Bxe6 Nxf1 23.Bxd7 Nxe3
24.Re1 Nxg2 (24...f6? loses to 25.Rxe3 Kf7 26.Bxd6 Rad8 27.Rf3 Rxd7 28.Bxe5)
25.Rg1 f6!. White cannot collect black knight and keep both of his bishops: 26.Bf5
Kf7 27.Rxg2 Kxe7 28.Rg7+ Kf8 29.Rxb7 Rg8 and it is easier for White here, but a draw is the most likely result. B) In case of 16...Nb8 analysis diagram White goes for a well-known solution: 17.Nf5+! Bxf5 18.Qxf5 Nbd7 19.Rhe1! (ruling out Black's ...Be3+ and getting ready for the files to open) 19...Rh5 20.f4 exf4 21.d4 and White wins soon. Anish understands that he has given Ding a chance, and now he continues precisely!
17.Rhf1!
Now White has a winning advantage, and Giri executes with a steady hand.
17...Nb8
White goes for a direct execution, immediately opening the centre.
18.d4
The idea we already established as good for White, 18.Nf5+ Bxf5 19.Qxf5 should work here as well as after 19...Nbd7 20.Kb1 with f4 to follow, Black cannot keep his stuff together.
18...exd4 19.cxd4 Nbd7
20.e5
Direct and strong. White gets his piece back while the attack continues.
20.h4 was probably working too.
20...dxe5 21.d5 Qb4 22.Qe2 Bxh3
Another way to give back the piece was 22...Bxe3+ 23.fxe3 Bg4 (23...Nxd5 loses to
24.Bxd5 Qc5+ 25.Qc2) 24.Bxf6+ Nxf6 25.hxg4 Rh4.
analysis diagram Black's king remains weak: 26.Rf5! Rxg4 27.Bd3 Nxd5 28.e4 Nf6 29.Rdf1 Rg6
30.g4 with g5 to follow, and Black will soon get mated.
23.gxh3 Kf8 24.h4
Ding Liren hopes to create practical survival chances:
24...Bd4 25.Rxd4!
25.Bb5 also looks good.
25...exd4 26.Nf5 Rxg5
26...Ne5 loses to 27.Bb5.
27.hxg5 Ne5
27...Ne8 loses to 28.Re1 Ng7 29.d6.
28.Bb5 Nfg4 29.Kb1 Kg8 30.Nh6+! Nxh6 31.Qxe5 Ng4 32.Qxc7
Now White is up material while his attack still continues.
32...Kg7
33.g6! Rf8
Or 33...Kxg6 34.Rg1 f5 35.f3.
34.gxf7 d3 35.Rg1 Rxf7 36.Qc3+
And facing a piece-down endgame, Black resigned. Rook lift ideas in the Petroff The Petroff Defence (or in some opening manuals 'the Russian') has a reputation of a quiet, solid choice where Black aims to equalize the game. Well, in many lines of the Petroff, this reputation is entirely mistaken, as we get sharp dynamic play. One of the ways for White to seize the initiative is by using a rook lift. Sometimes the rook is lifted via the fifth rank (Rb1-Rb5) and sometimes also via the second rank (Ra2-Re2). Usually we get sharp play, and the games I have selected show the dynamics. Game 38 Nigel Short 2650 Valery Salov 2630 Amsterdam 1989 The rook lift ideas we are about to see in this game were novel at the time and were difficult to evaluate in the pre-computer era. The positions we will reach are very dynamic, with razor-sharp tactics - perhaps not what you would expect in a 'quiet Petroff'.
1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nf6 3.Nxe5 d6 4.Nf3 Nxe4 5.d4 d5 6.Bd3 Bd6 7.O-O O-O 8.c4 c6
9.Nc3 Nxc3 10.bxc3 Bg4
Nowadays, theoretical discussions go in the direction of 10...dxc4 11.Bxc4 Bf5.
11.cxd5
If White places his rook on b1 with 11.h3 Bh5 12.Rb1, we can get different types of positions: 12...dxc4 13.Bxc4 b5 14.Bd3 Nd7 with comfortable play for Black, as for example in Ljubojevic-Khalifman, Reykjavik 1991.
11...cxd5 12.Rb1 b6
Black's best move is considered to be 12...Nd7. We can get dynamic positions where White sacrifices a pawn: 13.h3 Bh5 14.Rb5 Nb6 (modern theory considers that
14...Nf6 equalizes) 15.c4! Bxf3 16.Qxf3 dxc4 17.Bc2. We have quite a number of
top-level games with this position. White definitely has compensation for the sacrificed pawn but perhaps not more. White now goes for a nice rook lift that is worth remembering:
13.Rb5!
Nowadays, armed with strong engines, we all understand that White stands better here. In the ensuing positions we have sharp tactical play, offering plenty of ideas to a gifted player and very difficult to assess clearly without silicon assistance. In the late 1980s and early 1990, this was a hotly debated line on top level.
13...Bc7
Black can opt for a positional pawn sacrifice here, provided they understand the dangers: 13...Nd7 14.Rxd5 Nf6 15.Rb5 Qc7 16.h3. analysis diagram And now Black can play for a light- square blockade with 16...Be6 17.Qc2 Bc4
18.Rf5 Nd5.
14.c4
Direct, but best for White was to ask Black a difficult question about his bishop!
14.h3! Black does not have a good retreat, so he has to harass White's rook: 14...a6
(14...Bh5? loses to the simple 15.c4 Qd6 16.g4 Bg6 17.Rxd5) when White's best option is to go for an exchange sac with 15.hxg4! (my Stockfish is also enthusiastic about the slightly different exchange sacrifice 15.Rxd5! Qxd5 16.hxg4 Nd7 17.Qc2 with more than just compensation for White) 15...axb5 16.Qc2 g6. It is obvious that White has great compensation here, but in pre-computer days, judging the size of it was far from easy. It took top players quite some time to understand that White has a clear advantage here. Precision is needed! Black's biggest problem is that he is unable to coordinate his pieces. In the following game, Ivanchuk masterfully increased the pressure and finished with a direct mating attack: 17.Bxb5! (in a top level game two years prior, White opted for a more direct but less precise continuation: 17.Bh6 Re8 18.Bxb5 Re4 19.g5; the Bh6 stands great if aided by more forces to mate Black's king, but the way the game went, the bishop remained out of play and Black saved a draw in Short-Gelfand, Brussels Candidates 1991) 17...Qd6 (on 17...Nd7, White should, like Ivanchuk, continue limiting Black's pieces with 18.g5! as getting the exchange back with
18.Bh6 allows the good defensive resource 18...Nf6! 19.Bxf8 Kxf83) 18.g3! and
now: A) If 18...Nc6, White can continue similar to Ivanchuk in the game: 19.Kg2 f5
20.Rh1! and Black is in trouble (20.Bf4 Qd7 21.g5 is less good; White gets a
dominant knight but trades off too many pieces: 21...Bxf4 22.gxf4 Qc7 23.Bxc6 Qxc6 24.Ne5 Qd6 25.a4 Ra5 26.Rb1 and the game Sokolov-Nikcevic, Vrnjacka Banja 1998, later ended in a draw) 20...Rae8 21.Ng5 Re7 22.Rh6 and Black cannot keep his kingside intact, e.g. 22...Nd8 23.Bd3! Nf7 24.Nxf7 Rexf7 25.gxf5 Qd7
26.g4;
B) 18...Ra7 19.Re1 Nd7 20.g5! (limiting the Nd7 and preparing the Nf3-h2-g4 manoeuvre) 20...Rd8. Sensing that Black does not have any counterplay, White takes his time: 21.a4! Nb8. analysis diagram Now the time has come for a mating attack! 22.Nh2! Qf8 23.Ng4 Bd6 24.Kg2 (Black's situation is hopeless, White's attack wins by itself) 24...Kh8 25.Rh1 Qg7
26.Nf6 h5 27.Qd1 and not willing to wait for 28.Rxh5, Black resigned in Ivanchuk-
Bareev, Linares 1993.
14...Qd6?!
This lands Black in trouble. A few months later, Jan Timman vs Nigel Short came up with the best continuation for Black here: 14...dxc4!. The position is very tactical, and dynamically balanced. In the pre-computer era, it could easily take days of analyses to investigate all the possibilities in such positions. A) 15.Bxc4 should not worry Black: 15...Qd6 16.g3 Nc6; B) Jan must have unvestigated the tactical 15.Bxh7+!? Kxh7 16.Rg5. analysis diagram B1) 16...Bxf3? is a blunder that loses by force: 17.Qxf3 Nd7 18.Qh3+ (18.Qh5+ also wins: 18...Kg8 19.Rxg7+! Kxg7 20.Bh6+ Kf6 21.Bg5+; Black gets enough material for the queen but his pieces coordinate badly and king is overexposed)
18...Kg8 19.Rh5 f6 20.Re1!, cutting off the escape route; Black's king will soon be
mated; B2) Modern-day silicon brain analyses point out an interesting tactical line ending in equality: 16...Bc8! 17.d5 and now Black needs to make a prophylactic decision:
17...Kg8! (moving the king to a safer place) 18.Qd4 f6 19.Rh5. White has a strong
attack, but he is also a piece down. Best play probably leads to a draw: 19...Nc6!
20.Qxc4 b5! 21.Qxc6 (21.Qh4 Ne7 doesn't look like a winning attempt) 21...Qe8
22.Qxa8 Qxh5 23.Qxa7 Bd6 24.Qd4 Bb7 25.Rd1 Rd8 and Black has enough
compensation to hold; C) Short went for arguably the most logical continuation: 15.Be4. Here Timman missed a beautiful positional sacrifice: 15...Nd7! (15...Nc6 was played in Short-Timman, Hilversum m 1989) and if 16.Re1?! (Black has full compensation after 16.Bxa8 Qxa8) analysis diagram Black insists on sacrificing an exchange: 16...Nf6! 17.Bxa8 Qxa8 18.h3 Be6 and Black has a great game here, White faces a struggle for a draw.
15.Re1!
White is not afraid of ghosts and lets Black execute his threat.
15...Bxf3 16.Qxf3 Qxh2+ 17.Kf1
White is better developed as the black queen on h2 can easily be a liability here. However, the position is still complicated (a lot of tactics) and mistakes start to happen:
17...Nc6?!
17...Nd7 18.Rxd5 Nf6 19.Rf53 gave Black better surviving chances.
18.Rxd5 Rae8
18...g6? loses to 19.Rd7.
19.Be3?
Throwing away a relatively easy win. The way to execute was 19.Rxe8! Qh1+ (19...Rxe8? loses to 20.Rh5 Qd6 21.Ba3 (or 21.Bxh7+ Kf8 22.Ba3) 21...Nb4
22.Bxh7+ Kf8 23.Bg6! and Black loses decisive material or gets mated, or both)
20.Ke2 Rxe8+ 21.Be3 (the bad position of Black's Q, B, N plus K decides) 21...Qa1
22.Qh3 g6 23.Qd7.
19...g6
Now Black is back in the game!
19...f5 was also possible.
White decides to stop 20...Nb4, but this costs time.
20.a3
20...Qh1+?!
This check actually improves White's king. Black had to exploit White's weak king with 20...f5!. Now the Qh2 is suddenly well placed, and White's best option is to simplify into a drawish endgame: 21.Qh3 (21.g3 f4 22.gxf4 Bxf4 does not look like a winning attempt) 21...Qxh3 22.gxh3 f4
23.Bd2 Rxe1+ 24.Kxe1 Rd8 25.Rxd8+ Bxd8 and a draw is the most likely outcome
here.
21.Ke2 Qh4
Now White pursues a good idea to utilize the h-file, but he does not do it in the most precise way:
22.g4
Correct was 22.Kd1! (removing Black's 22...Nxd4 threat). Now White's king is relatively safe while he has different threats - Rd7 or g4 followed by Rh1: 22...Qe7. analysis diagram Naturally, White is not going to allow 23... Qxa3: 23.c5! bxc5 and now is the time to utilize the h-file: 24.Rh1! cxd4 25.Qh3 f5. Black escapes mate, however lands in a bad position: 26.Bc4 Kh8 27.Bg5 Qg7 28.Bh6 Qe7 29.Bxf8 Rxf8 30.Re1 Qg7
31.Qd3 and White has a large advantage and should win.
22...f5!
Black now has enough counterplay to hold!
23.Rd7 f4! 24.Rh1
24...Qf6?
A crucial blunder. This sharp game could have ended peacefully had Black gone for 24...Nxd4+!
25.Rxd4 Qg5! (25...Qf6? does not stop Qd5+ and loses to 26.Rd7) and we get a
drawish endgame after 26.Qd5+ (26.Qh3 is not a winning attempt as White may only get himself in trouble after the simple 26...Re7) 26...Qxd5 27.cxd5 Bd6 or
27...fxe3=.
25.Qd5+
Black now loses decisive material.
25...Re6
Or 25...Rf7 26.Rxh7.
26.g5
Too many black pieces are hanging.
26...Nxd4+ 27.Kd1 1-0
Game 39 Judit Polgar 2722 Anatoly Karpov 2693 Hoogeveen 2003 I like this game because, similar to Short-Salov, it contains a rook lift on the fifth rank by White. This time, however, the fifth rank is empty at the moment of the rook lift. White gets a choice between doubling on the e-file, keeping the pressure and building up a kingside attack, or a typical promising exchange sacrifice on e6. Judit decides to keep up the pressure on the e-file, developing a kingside attack and ending the game with a beautiful 'Lasker double bishop sacrifice'!
1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nf6 3.Nxe5 d6 4.Nf3 Nxe4 5.d4 d5 6.Bd3 Be7 7.O-O Nc6 8.c4 Nb4
9.Be2 O-O
10.a3
This move is no longer considered dangerous for Black due to the improvement on move 13. The current main line here (also involving a rook lift!) is 10.Nc3 Bf5 11.a3 Nxc3 12.bxc3 Nc6 13.Re1 Re8 14.Ra2! Nakamura-Nepomniachtchi, Madrid Candidates 2022. This rook lift idea, which is seen in a number of top-level games in these Petroff positions, is aimed at increasing the pressure on the e-file - see further on in this chapter.
10...Nc6 11.cxd5 Qxd5 12.Nc3 Nxc3 13.bxc3
13...Qd6
This devastating Karpov loss had such an impact that the text was not repeated in any subsequent top game! Theory considers 13...Bf5, preventing Rb1, to be Black's best option here, Kasparov-Adams, Linares 2002. Please check the comments in the next game Nakamura-Nepomniachtchi. Also possible is 13...Na5 14.Rb1 a6 (14...c6 should also be good for equality here)
15.Ne5 Bf5 16.Bf3 Qe6 (if Black wants less complications he can opt for 16...Be4)
17.Rb2 Bxa3 18.Re2 Bxc1 19.Nc6 Qf6 20.Nxa5 Bf4 21.Nxb7 Rab8 with a dynamic
balance, leading to a draw in Svidler-Adams, San Luis FIDE Wch 2005. White has a good central pawn structure here - while she improves the development of her pieces, her mobile pawn centre (due to White's pawn still being on c3!) does not give Black any target for counterplay against the d4-pawn.
14.Rb1
Polgar prepares her rook lift.
14.Bd3 was a good alternative.
14...b6 15.Re1 Be6
15...Bf6 was definitely a better choice, though White still has the intiative after
16.Bd3 Bg4 17.h3 Bh5 18.g4 Bg6. Here, White improves his position with a
standard rook lift: 19.Rb2! Rae8 20.Rbe2.
16.Bd3
White has a number of good options here; Polgar goes for the fifth rank rook lift.
16...Rae8
17.Rb5
My Stockfish advises the 'bold and direct' 17.Rxe6!. This typical exchange sacrifice, aimed to destroy Black's pawn structure, works well here: 17...fxe6 (17...Qxe6?? blunders into 18.d5) 18.Qc2! and here the best practical decision for Black is to sacrifice back an exchange: 18...Rxf3! (if 18...h6, 19.Qe2 and White builds up a powerful Q+B battery) 19.Bxh7+ Kf8 20.gxf3 Bf6.
17.Rb2 followed by Rbe2 is a more standard idea - see Nakamura-Nepomniachtchi
and similar examples in the comments to that game. White has the initiative after
17...Bd5 18.Rbe2! Bxf3 19.gxf3 Rd8 20.Bb1.
17...Na5?
In a higher sense, a losing mistake. Black had to go for 17...Bf6!. The logical decision for White here is to gain the bishop pair: 18.Ng5 (should White naively think Black had blundered into 18.d5?, he would only be in trouble after 18...Bg4!) 18...Bxg5 19.Rxg5. White has somewhat better chances, but there is a big fight ahead.
18.Rbe5!
White's pieces are ready to strike at the black king!
18...Nc6
Polgar has her dream position now. She can place her rook on e2, keeping pressure on the e-file, and has a great version of the Nakamura-Nepomniachtchi game, or she can opt for a very promising exchange sacrifice. Judit chooses the former. Happy with her position, she decides to keep all her options open:
19.R5e2
Here, the typical exchange sac 19.Rxe6! worked even better than two moves ago:
19...fxe6 20.Qc2 h6 (20...Rxf3 now leads to a lost position for Black after 21.Bxh7+
Kf8 22.gxf3 Bf6 23.Bg6 Rd8 24.Bh5) 21.Qe2 and the powerful Q+B battery should decide here.
19...Bd7
If Black plays 19...Bg4, White has a direct tactical refutation based on the e-file pin:
20.d5! Bxf3 (or 20...Na5 21.Re4 Bf5 22.R4e3 Bxd3 23.Qxd3 and tripling on the e-
file nets White a piece) 21.gxf3 Na5 22.Re5 with Qe2 to follow, and the e-file pin nets White a piece. Polgar feels that the time has come for the execution:
20.d5! Na5 21.Ne5 Bf6 22.Bf4 Bxe5 23.Bxe5
Very probably, Judit already had Lasker's bishop sacrifice in mind here. 23.Rxe5 also led to a crushing attack: 23...Qxa3 (or 23...Rxe5 24.Bxe5 Qxa3 25.Qh5) 24.Qh5 g6 25.Qh4.
23...Qxa3 24.Re3 Qc5?
Allowing a beautiful finish. Black had to stop the 'Lasker motif' with 24...g6; however, after 25.h4 White's attack should crush through (weak black king, knight out of play).
25.Bxh7+ Kxh7 26.Qh5+ Kg8 27.Bxg7 1-0
Game 40 Hikaru Nakamura 2760 Ian Nepomniachtchi 2766 Madrid Candidates 2022 We have quite a number of top-level games where the typical Petroff rook lift is predominantly aimed at controlling the e-file. White plays Ra2, most of the time to transfer this rook to e2, when the play often becomes tactical. The e-file pressure White gets is just one of the ingredients in the position, and White needs good tactical skills and a feel for the initiative to prevail. I will now show a number of top- level examples of such play. My aim is to show middlegame ideas; however, as usual I will try to provide some relevant opening information as well.
1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nf6 3.Nxe5 d6 4.Nf3 Nxe4 5.d4 d5 6.Bd3 Nc6 7.O-O Be7 8.c4 Nb4
9.Be2 O-O 10.Nc3
There is a game by Kasparov that is instructive for understanding this type of position: 10.a3 Nc6 11.cxd5 Qxd5 12.Nc3 Nxc3 13.bxc3 and now: A) For 13...Qd6 see the previous game Polgar-Karpov; B) 13...Na5 does not have the best reputation, and for good reason: 14.Ne5 Bf5
15.c4 Qd6
16.c5! and Black's forces suddenly lack coordination: 16...Qd5 17.Bf3 Be4 18.Bxe4
Qxe4 19.Bd2! Nc6 20.Re1. Black cannot prevent material loss: 20...Qh4. B1) Now Leko went for the human continuation, netting a clear positional advantage: 21.Nf3 Qh5 22.Rb1. Black has problems defending his queenside pawns. White had a clear advantage and went on to win in Leko-Adams, San Luis FIDE Wch 2005. It is perhaps good to note that 22...b6? (22...Rab8 does not solve the problems due to 23.Bf4) simply loses material to 23.cxb6 cxb6 24.Rc1; B2) Stockfish gives as more precise 21.g3 Qf6 22.Nd7 Qxd4 23.Nxf8 Bxc5
24.Nxh7! Qxf2+ 25.Kh1 and while it is easy for Stockfish to blink 'large advantage
for White' here, the position remains complicated and precise play is needed. For example, 25...Rd8 analysis diagram
26.Qg4! Qd4 27.Qf5! (the ending after 27.Qxd4 Bxd4 28.Rab1 Kxh7 is far less clear
as Black has decent drawing chances) 27...Qd5+ 28.Qxd5 Rxd5 29.Ng5 Rxd2
30.Re8+ Bf8 31.Rae1 and White should win.
C) 13...Bf5 14.Re1 Rfe8 15.Bf4 Rac8 16.c4. Now, compared to our main game, Black is forced to go with his queen to the centre: 16...Qe4 (16...Qd7? 17.d5 leads to a large advantage for White) 17.Be3
17...Bf6 (White's rook is still on a1 and here Black has an equalizing idea, shown by
Kramnik, in 17...Qc2!; Nepomniachtchi didn't have this queen trade option vs Nakamura as White's rook was already on a2: 18.d5 Na5 19.Nd4 Qxd1 20.Rexd1 Bd7 and the position was equal in Leko-Kramnik, Brissago Wch m 2004). Garry now went for a typical rook lift: 18.Ra2!. White does not have an immediate threat though and Black can choose between different useful moves: 18...b6 (18...Rcd8 certainly came into consideration) 19.h3 (preparing an interesting pawn push!)
19...Na5.
The way Kasparov tried to obtain the initiative here is useful to remember: 20.g4! Bg6 21.g5 Be7 22.Ne5 Bd6. C1) Here, an interesting idea was to try to lock out Black's queen: 23.Bf3 Qh4
24.Bg4 Bxe5 25.dxe5 (25.Bxc8?! looks very risky for White: 25...Rxc8 26.dxe5
Qxh3, though the engine still gives zeros). C11) It is quite possible that the situation after Black's exchange sac 25...Nxc4
26.Bxc8 Rxc8 did not look clear to Kasparov.
analysis diagram Yes, the silicon brain gives White a clear advantage, but precision is needed:
27.Qd7! (27.Qd4? is wrong as after 27...Qxd4 28.Bxd4 c5 Black's queenside pawns
are fast and Black is the one playing for a win) 27...Rf8 28.Bc1! c5 29.Rae2 with e6 to follow; C12) 25...Rcd8 26.Rd2 Nc6 27.Bf4. analysis diagram Black's queen appears locked out (though it's still difficult to catch it): 27...Bf5!
28.Rd5 Be6 29.Kg2 and though the engines give close to zero evaluations, to a
human the position looks promising for White! C2) The game went 23.Nxg6 hxg6 24.c5! (a dynamic pawn push) 24...Bf8 25.Bg4 Rcd8 26.Rae2 Qd5. Kasparov continues with 'initiative play'; basically each of his moves contains a threat - not giving the opponent a break: 27.Bf4! Rxe2 28.Qxe2. C21) 28...Qxd4? was wrong due to 29.Bxc7 Rd5 30.Bd6! and Black does not have a good continuation, e.g. 30...Bxd6 (30...Rxd6 31.cxd6 Qxd6 32.Rd1 Qxa3 33.Rd7 wins for White as Black soon loses material) 31.cxd6 Rxg5 (or 31...Rxd6 32.Qe8+ Kh7 33.Qxf7) 32.Rd1; C22) With precise defense Black could have kept equality: 28...Qc6! 29.Bf3 Qd7
30.Bg4 Qc6. Here, White's best winning attempt is 31.Qe4, but the position remains
balanced after 31...bxc5! (31...Qxe4? 32.Rxe4±) 32.d5 Qb7 (32...Rxd5? blunders into 33.Bf3) 33.Kg2. analysis diagram White has good compensation, but not more than that: 33...c4! (33...Rxd5? loses to
34.Rb1 Rd4 - or 34...Qc6 35.Bf3 Rd4 36.Qxd4 - 35.Qxb7 Nxb7 36.Be3 and Black
lands in a hopeless endgame after 36...Nd6 37.Bxd4 cxd4 38.Rb8) 34.Bf3 Qb6 35.h4 and it's time for Black to improve his knight: 35...Nb7! 36.Qxc4 Nd6 with approximate equality; C23) However, having been under pressure for quite a number of moves, Adams now slipped: 28...c6 29.Bc7 Ra8
30.Qe5 (after having played with great energy, Kasparov now misses the precise
execution: 30.Qa6! and Black is forced into a queen trade: 30...Qc4 31.Qxc4 Nxc4. analysis diagram Now, pawn dynamics decide: 32.d5! cxd5 33.c6 Na5 34.Rc1 Bxa3 35.Rc2 d4 (or
35...Bc5? 36.Rxc5) 36.Bf4 d3 37.Ra2 Bb4 38.c7 and Black loses decisive material)
30...Qxe5 31.Rxe5.
Black should draw this ending, but Adams was probably under time pressure here and some effort and precision are still needed. C231) Perhaps, a less complicated and easier draw could have been obtained by
31...Nb3. Adams was probably worried that his knight would get trapped, but this is
not a really likely scenario. For example, 32.cxb6 (or 32.d5 cxd5 33.cxb6 - 33.c6 drops a pawn to 33...Nd4 - 33...axb6 34.Bxb6 and the knight won't get trapped)
32...axb6 33.Bxb6 and now the most accurate way to draw is by chasing White's
dark-squared bishop: 33...Rb8 (Black should also hold with 33...Bxa3 34.Re3 Nd2)
34.Bc7 Rb7 35.Bd8 Rb8;
C232) After the game move 31...Nc4, Garry went for pawn dynamics (like in the previous comment) but now this should have worked less well: 32.d5! Nxe5
33.Bxe5.
33...cxd5? (the game could have been saved with 33...f5! 34.Bf3 - or 34.gxf6 gxf6
35.Bh2 f5 36.Bf3 Rc8 - 34...Re8 35.Bf4 Bxc5 36.dxc6 Kf8 and Black is just in time:
37.c7 Ke7 38.Bb7 Kd7 39.a4 Bd4 40.Kg2 Rc8 41.h4 Rxc7 with a draw; or 41...Bc3,
and neither side can improve) 34.c6 and now the passed c-pawn will cost Black a full rook: 34...f5 35.gxf6 gxf6 36.Be6+ Kg7 37.Bg3 Bxa3
38.Bxd5 Rc8 39.c7 Bc5 40.Bb7 Rxc7 41.Bxc7 a5 42.Bc6. White has a winning
advantage and he executed successfully in Kasparov-Adams, Linares 2002.
10...Bf5 11.a3 Nxc3 12.bxc3 Nc6 13.Re1 Re8
Now Nakamura goes for a standard idea, which he had already tried before in one of his games:
14.Ra2!
White has the initiative, but with precise play Black is very close to equality. He has a couple of options:
14...Bf8
A) 14...Na5 is probably not a good idea as White's initiative now develops fast:
15.cxd5 Qxd5 16.Rb2.
A1) The stem game (in GM practice) went 16...a6 and White sacrificed a pawn to seize the initiative: 17.Ne5! Bxa3 18.Bf3 Qd6 19.Rbe2 Bxc1 and here the game went
20.Qxc1 Nc6 and was later drawn in Shankland-Robson, St Louis 2014. White's
play can be improved with 20.Nc4! Qd7 21.Nxa5 Ba3 22.Bxb7 and White has a clear advantage; A2) If 16...c6 White, similar to previous lines, can sacrifice a pawn to develop an initiative: 17.Ne5! Bxa3 18.Bf3 Qd6 19.Rbe2 Bxc1 20.Qxc1 and the pressure on the e-file (tactical motifs) plus Black's stranded Na5 promise White more than sufficient compensation; A3) 16...b6 17.Ne5 Rad8 18.Rb5?! (Nakamura thinks he wins by force, but strongest was 18.Bf3 Qd6 19.Rbe2 f6 and now the Kasparov-type idea (as in his game vs Adams) 20.g4! Bc8 21.Nd3 with a tremendous initiative) 18...c5 19.Rxa5. Here Black has a great resource: 19...Qxe5!! with equality. In the game Nakamura- Akobian, Saint Louis 2016, White indeed won easily after 19...bxa5 20.Bc4. B) Black has a reasonable alternative: 14...dxc4 15.Bxc4 Na5 16.Bd3 (playing on the misplaced Na5 with 16.Bb5 c6 17.Bf1 does not work here as Black is fine after
17...Bf6 18.Rae2 Rxe2 19.Qxe2 Be6 20.Ne5 c5) 16...Bxd3 17.Qxd3 Bf6 18.Rxe8+
Qxe8 19.Re2 Qc6 20.Bg5 and White has some pressure, but the game Saric- Mastrovasilis, Greece tt 2017, ended in a draw; C) 14...Bf6 is another serious alternative, played by the 14th World Champion:
15.Rb2 (15.cxd5 Qxd5 16.c4 Qd6 looks unclear as, similar to positions we could
have reached in our main game, White has a mobile pawn centre but it's not easy to find a cleverl way to push his pawns) 15...b6 16.Bf4 (the fifth rank rook lift with
16.cxd5 Qxd5 17.Rb5 makes little sense here as it's difficult to find a follow-up after
the simple 17...Qd7) 16...Na5 17.cxd5 Qxd5 18.Ne5. White gives up his bishop pair and focuses on light-square control: 18...Bxe5!
19.Bf3 Qd7 20.Bxe5 Nc4! 21.Rbe2 c6 with approximate equality and later a draw in
Alekseev-Kramnik, Dortmund 2007.
15.cxd5 Qxd5 16.c4
An important moment! Where to go with the queen? Nepo takes a brave decision, trusting his calculation skills:
16...Qe4
16...Qd6! looks about equal as it's not easy for White to find a clever way to make
good use of his mobile pawn center; for example, 17.Rd2 Rad8 18.Bf1 Bg4 19.Rxe8 Rxe8 20.Bb2 b6 with a dynamic balance. Black's queen is now exposed and we get a lot of tactics. Nakamura asks his opponent some direct questions:
17.Bf1
17.Be3 was the alternative.
Black has two normal moves here. Which one to choose? A tough question!
17...Qg4
Not the best response. Black had to go for 17...Qb1!, holding with computer-like precision: 18.Rxe8 Rxe8 19.Rb2 Qa1 20.Rxb7 analysis diagram
20...Be4! (20...Bxa3? is wrong due to 21.Rxc7 Qxc1 22.Qxc1 Bxc1 23.Rxc6)
21.Rxc7 Bd6! 22.Rd7 Bxa3 23.Nd2 Qxc1! (23...Bf5 is wrong due to 24.Nb3 Qb1
25.Rb7) 24.Qxc1 Bxc1 25.Nxe4 Rxe4 26.d5 and this tactical tussle peters out into a
drawn opposite-coloured bishops endgame: 26...Re7 27.dxc6 Rxd7 28.cxd7 Bg5.
18.h3
Now Black's pieces are poorly coordinated, his queen is over-exposed, and he is in trouble.
18...Rxe1 19.Qxe1 Qe4 20.Re2 Qd3 21.Rb2 Qe4 22.Re2 Qd3
23.Re3
23.Nh4 was promising too, as after the relatively forced 23...Qb1 24.d5 Nd4 25.Rb2
Qa1 26.Nxf5 Nxf5 27.Rxb7 Bxa3 28.Bd2 White has a clear advantage due to his bishop pair and active rook.
23...Qb1 24.d5 Ne7
White does have a clear advantage, but we have lively piece play (a lot of tactics) and Nakamura lets it slip:
25.Nd2
Correct was 25.Nd4! and Black is in trouble: 25...Qb6 26.Qd2 (27.Rxe7 is a threat, and tactics do not save Black) 26...c5 (the relatively passive 26...Bg6 was perhaps best; White has a strong initiative after 27.Rb3 Qa6 28.g4 Rd8 29.Qb2 b6 30.f4)
27.dxc6 bxc6 28.Rxe7 Rd8. It may look as if Black is saved by tactics, but the weak
back rank decides: 29.Re8! Rxd4 30.Qe3 (31.Qe7 is a threat) 30...Bd7 31.Ra8 Be6. analysis diagram White's Bc1 comes into play with devastating force: 32.a4! c5 33.Ba3 Rd8 34.Bxc5 and Black loses decisive material.
25...Qa1
White is still a bit better, but the worst is definitely behind Black.
26.Nb3 Qf6 27.Bd2 Ng6 28.Na5
28.Bc3 was perhaps a better try.
28...b6 29.Nc6 Bd7
White's 'active' Nc6 is not causing much damage, and moreover it can be removed any time. Hikaru understood he had let his advantage slip.
30.Bc3 Qd6
Now the position is unclear. Black could also have considered 30...Qg5.
31.Bb4 Qf6 32.Bc3 Qd6 33.Bb4 Qf6 34.Bc3 1⁄2-1⁄2
Open files The advantage of controlling an open file is a well-known strategic concept. The diagrammed position shows the most common situation: White has the advantage since he exerts pressure on the pen file and controls it, and Black is trying to equalize by neutralizing that advantage. Barring unexpected factors (blunders), we usually have two basic scenarios: A) Black successfully trades pieces, making a draw, or B) Black suffers (and eventually loses). In our selected game Deac-Robson (see below), it was 'B'. An open file may also produce more dynamic and tactical play. In the other three games I have selected, White controls the e-file, but he connects this strategic trump card to tactical motifs and ideas. Game 41 Sanan Sjugirov 2663 Arjun Erigaisi 2634 Riga 2021
1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nf6 3.Nxe5 d6 4.Nf3 Nxe4 5.d4 d5 6.Bd3 Bd6 7.O-O O-O 8.c4
8...c6
8...Be6 has a bad reputation, and for a good reason. Black lands in a passive position
after 9.Re1 Re8. Now White takes space, a typical plan in such positions, and gains a comfortable advantage with 10.c5! Be7 11.Nc3 Nxc3 (here Black has an interesting and as yet untried option to make a positional pawn sacrifice, which in these circumstances may not be so bad: 11...Nc6!? 12.Nxe4 - White is, of course, not obliged to take the pawn and can continue his development with 12.Bf4 - 12...dxe4
13.Bxe4 Bd5 and for the sacrificed pawn Black has control of the central light
squares and should probably hold this) 12.bxc3 Nd7 13.Bf4 (Black's counterplay attempt does not bring him the desired result) 13...b6 14.Qc2 Nf8
15.Ne5! Bf6 (grabbing a pawn with 15...bxc5 is not advisable as after 16.Bb5 f6
17.Nc6 Qc8 18.c4! Black will soon start losing material) 16.Bb5 Bxe5 17.Bxe5 Bd7
18.c6. White had an advantage and went on to win in Kamsky-Jussupow, Tilburg
1992.
9.Nc3
For 9.cxd5 cxd5 10.Nc3 Nxc3 11.bxc3 Bg4 12.Rb1 see Short-Salov.
9...Nxc3
Trying to maintain the knight on e4 is not a good idea for Black here as after 9...Re8
10.Qc2 Bf5 11.Re1 Bb4 White has a strong exchange sacrifice: 12.Bg5! Qa5
13.Nxe4! dxe4 14.Bxe4 Bxe1 15.Bxf5 g6 16.Be4 Bb4 17.c5!. Black is in a bad
shape here: a bad king position combined with a locked-up bishop. He decided to give material: 17...Nd7 (17...Qa6 keeps the bishop alive but will not make Black happy either as White gets a large advantage after 18.h4 Nd7 19.h5 Nf8 20.Bd3! b5
21.a4) 18.a3 Bxc5 19.dxc5 Qxc5 20.Rd1 and White had a big advantage and won
easily in Grischuk-Rozentalis, Istanbul Ech 2003.
10.bxc3 dxc4
Black can also try to be clever and play a useful move with 10...h6. On the top level, this has been tried by Baadur Jobava) in mostly blitz/rapid games. An easy way for White to get a large advantage was demonstrated by Santosh Vidit. Similar to Kamsky-Jussupow above, White takes space with the typical 11.c5! Bc7. Now White starts a direct attack - easy logical play: 12.Bc2 Nd7 13.Qd3 Nf6 14.Ne5 Re8 15.Bf4 Black has no counterplay. 15...Re7 16.Rae1 Qe8 17.Re3! Be6 18.Rg3. White had a winning attack, but later he messed it up and lost in Vidit-Jobava, MrDodgy Online Inv blitz 2021.
10...Bg4 is another option for Black, when play usually continues 11.cxd5 cxd5
12.Rb1 - see Short-Salov.
11.Bxc4 Bf5
In case Black goes for a pin with 11...Bg4, White gets the advantage with 12.h3 Bh5 analysis diagram
13.g4! Bg6 14.Ne5 Nd7 15.Nxg6 hxg6 16.Bb3. White has the bishop pair plus a
space advantage, and his king is actually quite safe.
12.Bg5
Less played but quite interesting is 12.Ng5 when we get dynamic play: 12...h6
13.Qf3 Bg6. Now White goes for an interesting pawn sacrifice resulting in g-file
pressure: 14.Ne4! Bxh2+ 15.Kxh2 Qh4+ 16.Qh3 A) 16...Qxe4? is not a good idea for Black though precision is needed as usual:
17.Ba3! (the immediate 17.f4 does not bring White the desired result after 17...Bf5!
18.g4 - or 18.Qg3 Nd7 19.Ba3 c5 - 18...b5! with unclear play, while 19.Bb3?
blunders into the simple 19...Qe2+) 17...Rd8 18.f4! and White's pawn avalanche decides: 18...Qf5 (or 18...Bf5 19.g4 - 19.Qg3 is also strong - 19...b5 20.Rae1) 19.g4 Qc2+ 20.Kg1 and White has a winning attack; B) 16...Qxh3+ 17.gxh3 Bxe4 18.Rg1 Re8 (Black cannot keep his extra pawn as
18...Kh7? blunders into the prosaic 19.Ba3) 19.Bxh6 g6. White has some initiative
though Black should hold. White eventually won in J. van Foreest-Esipenko, France tt 2023.
12...Qa5
12...Qc7 runs into the tactic 13.Nh4! Bxh2+ 14.Kh1 Bf4 15.Nxf5 Bxg5 16.f4.
Black is not developed (the Nb8 is still on its initial square) and White's attack is fast. Black's next move, though relatively logical, is already a losing mistake:
16...Bf6? (more resilient is 16...Bd8 though White has great attacking prospects after
the typical rook lift 17.Rf3) 17.Qh5 g6 18.Qh6 Qa5 19.Rf3 (going for the win of Black's queen; interesting enough, White had all the time in the world here and
19.g4! was even stronger; White's attacking options are so great here that 19.Ne7+
Bxe7 20.f5 wins as well) 19...Qxf5 20.Rh3 Qxh3+ 21.Qxh3 and White went on to win in Idani-Gholami, Turkey tt 2022.
13.Nh4
The dynamic 13.d5!? has been tried in a number of top-level games. In my opinion, Black can hold here, but he needs to be well prepared. Readers interested in theoretical research are advised to investigate this dynamic option.
13...Be6
Let's stop here and take stock. We now get one of the typical Petroff pawn structures.
14.Bxe6 Qxg5 15.Nf3 Qa5 16.Bb3 Nd7 17.Qd3 Rae8 18.Rfe1 Nf6
White has a strong light-squared bishop, but is difficult to further exploit its active position. White has somewhat more space and mobile central pawns, but it's not easy to push them and Black may challenge White's centre by pushing ...c5. The only open file, the e-file, may be of importance, but at the moment it's not clear how either side can take control of it. Most probably, the objective assessment should be: 'dynamic balance/slight pull for White'. Both sides make a couple of useful moves first:
19.g3 g6 20.h4 Kg7 21.Kg2
Black decides to 'stay put', making neutral moves:
21...h6
A couple of months after this game, Ivic applied a different and probably better strategy, immediately hitting White's centre with 21...c5. The position is dynamic and White now looked for a tactical solution related to Black's f7-weakness:
22.Rxe8 Rxe8 23.Ng5 Re7.
White now restricted the black queen's retreat options: 24.Rb1! b6 25.Rd1 cxd4! (the immediate 25...h6 leads to a promising position for White after 26.Bxf7! Rxf7
27.Nxf7 Kxf7 28.Qc4+ - sadly, Black does not have ...Qd5 - 28...Kg7 29.Qe6 Bf8
30.Rd3!) 26.Qxd4 (26.cxd4 brings White nowhere after 26...h6 when White's knight
has to retreat, leading to equality: 27.Nf3 Qh5) 26...Be5 27.Qb4 Qxb4 28.cxb4 h6 Abdusattorov kept the game alive by taking an interesting decision to unbalance the material: 29.Nxf7!? Rxf7 30.Bxf7 Kxf7 31.b5 Ke7 32.f4 Bd6 33.Rd4 h5 34.Ra4 Bb8. The position is dynamically balanced and the game Abdusattorov-Ivic, Belgrade 2022, later ended in a draw.
22.Rad1 Qc7
Sjugirov now takes an interesting strategic decision, deciding that the control of the e-file is worth closing off his active Bb3:
23.c4!
Erigaisi goes for the most logical reply, stopping c5 followed by Ne5:
23...c5
Worth considering was 23...Rxe1!? 24.Rxe1 Qd8!, allowing the bishop retreat (to control the Ne5 jump) while preparing ...Re8.
23...Nh5, aiming for ...Bxg3, is not good as White gets a winning attack with
24.Ne5! Bxe5 25.dxe5 Rxe5 26.Qc3 f6 27.c5!. With a weak king and a hopeless
Nh5, Black's position now quickly collapses, e.g. 27...Rfe8 28.Rxe5 fxe5 29.Rd6 Nf6 30.Be6.
24.d5
White strategic idea is now clear: he wants to take control of the e-file with Ba4!
24...Nh5
Black looks for counterplay by creating the threat of ...Bxg3. Trading all four rooks is generally a good idea, but due to Black's potentially weak kingside it does not quite work here: 24...Rxe1 25.Rxe1 Re8 26.Rxe8 Nxe8 27.h5! g5. analysis diagram The perfect square for the white knight? Well, f5! 28.Nh2! Nf6 29.Nf1 Nxh5 30.Ne3 (White gets his pawn back while attack continues) 30...Nf6 31.Nf5+ Kf8 32.Nxh6 Qd7 33.Nf5 and due to Black's weak king White has a large advantage here.
24...Qd7, preventing White's Ba4 and keeping control of the e-file, has another
problem: the pin on the a1-h8 diagonal (another plus of 23.c4!) 25.Qc3! and the situation is unpleasant for Black. White says: 'I calculated well! Go ahead with your bishop sacrifice!'
25.Ba4! Re7
For better or worse, and certainly for practical reasons, Black had to go ahead with his piece sacrifice: 25...Rxe1 26.Rxe1 analysis diagram
26...Bxg3! 27.fxg3 Qxg3+ 28.Kf1 Nf4. White gets an advantage but needs to be
precise: 29.Qc3+ Kg8 A) 30.Re4 looks logical and temping, but after the forced 30...g5 31.hxg5 hxg5
32.Qe3 Qh3+ 33.Kf2 Qg2+ 34.Ke1 Black has a beautiful tactic based on the bad
position of White's rook on e4: 34...Qb2! (34...Qxa2 is less good as White has a clear advantage after 35.Qb3 Qg2 - 35...Qa1+ 36.Kd2 - 36.Kd1 a6 37.Qe3) 35.Qb3 and now: analysis diagram Black saves the game with the surprising 35...f5!. The smoke soon clears and we get a drawish endgame after 36.Qxb2 Nd3+ 37.Ke2 Nxb2 38.Re7 Nxa4 39.Nxg5 Nb6: White is active but not for more than a draw; B) 30.Re5, to weaken Black's position, doesn't really bring White anything: 30...f6
31.Re7 g5;
C) 30.Re7! and now we get a relatively forced sequence: 30...g5 31.hxg5 hxg5
32.Qe3 Qh3+ 33.Kf2 Qg2+ 34.Ke1 Qxa2 (34...Qb2? is wrong due to 35.Qd2)
35.Qb3 Qg2 36.Kd1 a6. White is better but play remains sharp and it's easy to err.
26.Rxe7 Qxe7 27.Re1 Qf6
28.Nd2!
White is not worried by Black's tricks. He has a strong initiative and the extra pawn is little consolation for Black. Sjugirov executes well. Black's queen is badly placed in case of 28...Qd4 29.Qc2.
28...Qxh4 29.Ne4
Also good was 29.Bd1 Qd4 30.Qc2. Black cannot prevent Bxh5, damaging his pawn structure, since 30...Nf6?? blunders a queen to the prosaic 31.Nb3.
29...Qe7 30.Qc3+!
An important check, disrupting Black's coordination.
30...Be5
30...Nf6 loses to 31.Nxc5 Qc7 32.Nd7, while 30...Qe5 lands Black in a lost ending
after 31.Qxe5+ Bxe5 32.Nxc5 Bc3 33.Rc1.
31.Nxc5 Qxc5 32.Qxe5+
32...Kg8
32...Nf6 was a better defence as White will still need to show accuracy: 33.Re4!
(33.Re3 is not good due to 33...Qxc4) 33...Rd8 (33...g5 leads to a winning ending for White after 34.d6 Qxe5 35.Rxe5 Rd8 36.c5). White's d-pawn push has been temporarily stopped, but now Black's rook is not well placed after 34.Re3!. Black has no counterplay and runs out of moves, eventually losing decisive material. Here are a few sample lines: A) 34...Qxc4?? 35.Rf3 Qa6 36.Bc6; B) 34...b6 35.Bc6 g5 36.a4 and White has a winning endgame after 36...Kg6
37.Qe7;
C) 34...g5 leads to a winning ending for White after 35.Qe7; D) A similar outcome is 34...Qd6 35.Qxd6 Rxd6 36.Re7; E) 34...Qb6 35.Rb3 and Black soon loses decisive material, e.g. 35...Qa6 36.Qe7 Rf8 37.Bb5. Now White's d-pawn simply queens.
33.d6! Qxc4 34.Bb3 Qc8 35.Qe7
Note the terrible position of Black's Nh5.
35...Kg7 36.d7 Qc6+ 37.Kg1 Qf6 38.Qxf8+ 1-0
Game 42 Bogdan-Daniel Deac 2693 Ray Robson 2689 Prague 2023 Modern theoretical/middlegame discussions in the Ruy Lopez Anti-Berlin variation are centred around White's attempt to prove that only the control of the open e-file is sufficient to put Black under long-term pressure. This game is a good example, and I will also put some other relevant examples in the comments. White tries to combine the control of the e-file, more space, and tactical elements, to put long-term pressure on Black. With precise play Black should be okay, but in human play it's easy to err. Also, in normal circustances, White has pressure while being on the safe side - Black rarely wins those positions, and this often puts White in a psychologically comfortable situation.
1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 Nf6 4.O-O Nxe4 5.Re1 Nd6
6.Nxe5
Recently, White players have also tried 6.a4!?, which is based on a strategic idea: White tries to get a favourable pawn structure on the queenside after 6...a6 (6...Be7 is considered Black's best - see the next game, Grandelius-Howell) 7.Nxe5 Be7 8.Bf1 Nxe5 9.Rxe5 O-O 10.d4 and compared to our current main game we have the moves
6.a4 a6 included. This favours White in quite a number of lines, for example
10...Ne8 11.Nc3 Bf6 12.Re1 d5 13.a5 c6.
White's pawn being on a5 and Black's on a6 clearly favour White here as Black's queenside can be easier targeted. Grischuk achieved the same and got a nice advantage in his game vs Gukesh (see the comments to 13.Qc3!? in this game)!
6...Be7 7.Bf1 Nxe5 8.Rxe5 O-O 9.d4 Bf6 10.Re1
Though the pawn structure is symmetrical, White has some advantage. He has more space and easier development, and controls the only open file. Black aims to exchange a few pieces, finish development and equalize. In practical human vs human play, Black's road to equality is not exactly straightforward, as precision is needed and it is easy to err. We regularly see quite a number of top players stumbling on this road as Black.
10...Re8
At the moment of writing, the text is the most played move here. Black's plan is clear: trade a pair of rooks and finish development. Black's main alternative is 10...Nf5. Here, the most ambitious for White is to take space: 11.d5 Re8 (if Black starts with 11...d6, White plays 12.Nd2 and after 12...Re8
13.Ne4 the situation is not pleasant for Black as White has more space while Black
has problems to develop his cramped pieces) 12.Rxe8+ Qxe8 13.Qd3 d6 14.Nd2. An important moment! Black (Aronian) follows the logic: 'I have less space, let's trade some pieces'. It's sound logic but it doesn't work here. As I said, in human over-the-board play the road to equality is not easy as Black needs to be precise!
14...Bg5 (Black needed to hit White's centre to look for immediate activity with
14...c6! 15.c3 - very probably, Levon did not like 15.Ne4, but Black has suffient
dynamics for equality after 15...Be5! - 15...cxd5 16.Qxd5 Qc6! 17.Qxc6 bxc6
18.Ne4 Be7 and the position is equal; the game Jones-Jakovenko, Khanty-Mansiysk
2019, later ended in a draw) 15.Nf3 Bxc1 16.Rxc1 and Black has a difficult life ahead! White will control the e-file, and keep and increase his space advantage while Black struggles to find any counterplay: 16...Bd7 17.Re1 Qd8 18.Qc4. White's pieces are well coordinated, he has firm grip on the position, and counterplay with ...c6 will work less good now, e.g. 18...g6 19.h3 Ng7 20.Re3 a5
21.a4. It's not easy to give Black good advice, so Aronian says: 'Okay, I don't have
any counterplay but my position is solid, show me your plan'. 21...Ne8 22.Qd4 Ng7. Now White (Magnus Carlsen) took space on the kingside with 23.g4!. Black hopes that with the pawn on g4, White's king position will be weaker and his central counterplay has better chances to work: 23...c6 24.c4! Ne8 (if 24...cxd5 25.cxd5 Rc8, White targets Black's weak pawns with 26.Qf4 Qf8 27.Rb3 Rc7 28.Rb6 Ne8
29.Nd2! and Black's problems continue) 25.Qf4 Kg7 26.Rb3 Rb8 27.Ng5
27...Nf6? (a decisive mistake in a difficult position. 27...Qf6 28.Qd2 h6 was
probably Black's best, but the problems remain; Black is still doomed to passive defence: 29.Ne4 Qd8 - or 29...Qe7 30.Re3 - 30.Qd4+ Kg8 31.Rf3) 28.Rf3! A typical logical and clean execution by Magnus! (if 28.Qxd6 h6 - 28...cxd5 loses to
29.Rf3! Bxa4 30.Qe5! - 29.Ne6+! - 29.Nf3? leads to a draw after 29...cxd5 30.cxd5
Bxa4 31.Qxd8 Rxd8 32.Rxb7 Rxd5= - 29...Bxe6 - 29...fxe6?? blunders into 30.dxe6 Be8 31.Rxb7+ - 30.Qxd8 Rxd8 31.dxe6 fxe6 32.Rxb7+ there is still some technical work ahead). Black has a set of combined problems: f-file pressure, the d6-pawn hanging, the threat of a Qd4 pin... 28...h6 (28...cxd5 29.cxd5 b5 30.Qd4 and the pin decides; 28...Qe7 loses to 29.Re3 Qd8 30.Qxd6) 29.Ne4 Nxe4 30.Qxf7+ Kh8
31.Qxg6 1-0 Carlsen-Aronian, Stavanger 2018.
11.Bf4 Rxe1 12.Qxe1 Ne8
Black's plan is clear: push ...d5, develop the Bc8, preferably trade a few more pieces and make a draw. White has different options, and he can choose between a technical and a tactical approach.
13.c3
A) The tactical option is 13.Nc3!?. White wants to build on his development advantage and does not mind sacrificing (a) pawn(s) in the process. We now get interesting tactical play where White is taking risks too. This has been tried in quite a few games at top level. The ensuing positions are probably dynamically balanced. For readers with a good memory who are willing to put in some serious computer- supported work, it can be rewarding. I will give a couple of interesting examples. The most principled decision, accepting the sacrifice, is Black's best here: 13...Bxd4! (White has a safe advantage after 13...d6 14.Bd3) 14.Nd5 and now: A1) 14...c6 leads more or less by force to a slight technical advantage for White:
15.Ne7+ Kf8 16.Nxc8 Qf6! 17.Rd1! Rxc8 18.Qe4
18...Bc5 19.Rxd7 Rd8 20.Rxd8 Qxd8. White has the bishop pair advantage and a
safe long-term pull. It does not hurt to mention that this is one of those typical positions where the bishop pair brings White an advantage while 'pure bishop vs knight' would be equal. In the few top games we have, White pressed a bit but ultimately it ended in a draw as in, for example, Dominguez Perez-So, Zagreb rapid 2022; A2) 14...d6 15.Bg5 f6 16.Bh4 (on the top level, White has also tried other moves here, like 16.Be3, 16.Qe4 or 16.Bc4) 16...g5! (16...Bxb2 is certainly playable; however, after 17.Rb1 Be5 18.f4
18...c6! 19.fxe5 cxd5 20.exf6 Nxf6 21.Bd3 Bd7! the position looks slightly easier to
play for White; the game Karjakin-Anand, Stavanger 2017, eventually ended in a draw) 17.Qe4 and now: A21) Objectively best may be to grab another pawn with 17...Bxb2! 18.Re1 Be5. White has to open up the position: 19.f4 gxh4 (19...gxf4!? is something to explore)
20.fxe5 dxe5 21.Bd3.
Black has collected some pawns but has a weak king. White has full compensation but probably not more: 21...Kf8 (Black had an interesting alternative in 21...Bf5!? when there seems to be a dynamic balance: 22.Qxf5 Qxd5 23.Qxh7+ - 23.Re4 leads by force to a balanced ending after 23...Ng7 24.Rg4 Qd4+! 25.Kf1 e4 26.Qxe4 Qxe4
27.Rxe4 Re8 28.Rxh4 with a draw as the likely outcome - 23...Kf8 24.Re4 Rd8 and
White has compensation, but probably not more. The silicon brain gives zeroes, in human terms it's an 'unclear game') 22.Ne3 Qd4 (22...Qe7, protecting the h7-pawn, was perhaps a better idea) 23.Qxh7 Be6 24.Bg6 Rd8 25.Qh6+ Ke7 26.Qh7+ Kf8
27.h3! and Black's king problem is not easy to solve. White went on to win in
Kryvoruchko-Tari, Germany Bundesliga 2022/23; A22) If 17...Be5, as in the previous comment, White opens up the position: 18.f4 gxh4 19.fxe5 dxe5 20.Bd3 and compared to the comments above White's rook still needs to be developed but his b2-pawn still lives: 20...Kf8 21.Rf1 (White's rook is well placed on the f-file) 21...Be6
22.Nxf6! Nxf6 23.Qxe5 (also quite promising for White looks 23.Qxh4 Kg7
24.Qg5+ Kf7 25.Bxh7 and Black has to find only moves to stay in the game:
25...Qh8! 26.Bg6+ Ke7 27.Qxe5 Rd8! and in human practical play, White has better
chances here) 23...Kf7 24.Be2. Niemann wants to create motifs around the white king, hoping for counterplay: 24...h3 (my Stockfish 'easily' comes to zeroes with
24...Qe7 25.Bh5+ Kg7 26.Qg5+ Kh8 27.Qxf6+ Qxf6 28.Rxf6 Bxa2!) 25.g4 h6
(25...Qd5 26.Rxf6+ Ke7 27.Qxd5 Bxd5 28.Rh6±) 26.g5 hxg5 27.Bh5+ Kg7. An interesting moment! Find a 'prophylactic attacking move' for White!
28.c3 is the quiet move that wins. White threatens 29. Qxg5+ with Rxf6 to follow
while ...Qd4+ is no longer possible. Instead, the game Deac-Niemann, Sharjah 2022, went 28.Qxg5+ Kh8 29.Qxf6+ Qxf6 30.Rxf6 Rg8+ 31.Kf1 Bxa2 and was later drawn. B) 13.Qc3!? is an interesting alternative worth exploring! Let's have a look: B1) The active attempt 13...d6!? 14.Nd2 c5 probably equalizes, but Black needs to be accurate: analysis diagram For example, 15.Qb3! Bxd4 16.Bc4 Qc7! (16...Qf6? loses to 17.g3 followed by Ne4)
17.Nf3 Bf6 18.Re1 Bf5 (18...Bg4? is wrong due to 19.Ng5 Bh5 20.Qh3). White's
initiative looks promising but Black holds. A logical, consistent follow-up can be
19.h3 Bg6 20.g4 h6 21.h4 Qd7! 22.g5 hxg5 23.hxg5 Qg4+ (23...Bd8? loses to
24.Nh4) 24.Bg3 Bxg5 25.Nxg5 Qxg5 26.Qxb7 Rd8 (White's king is not great, so
White has to trade queens) 27.Qe7 Qxe7 28.Rxe7 d5 29.Bd3 Bxd3 30.cxd3 and White's active rook certainly compensates for the pawn deficit, but still a draw looks like the most objective result here; B2) 13...d5 14.Nd2 B21) 14...c6, and now Grischuk tries to achieve the pawn structure I was talking about in my comments to move 6: 15.a4!? Nd6 16.Re1 Nf5 17.Nf3 Be6 18.a5! a6 (White controls the e-file; Black's queenside is fixed and can easily be targeted. White has a good situation here) 19.h3 g6 20.Bd3 Rc8 (20...Ng7 was a better move, not allowing the motif in the game. Black parries the immediate threats, but after
21.Qb4 Qd7 22.Ne5 Qe7 23.Qb6 h5 White has obvious pressure).
An important moment! White had to sense which was the right trade: 21.Bxf5! (White went for a different trade: 21.Qb4 Qe7 22.Qxe7 Nxe7 with still some pressure, but the game soon dried up and Black held a draw in Grischuk-Gukesh, Dubai 2023) 21...Bxf5 22.Qb4!. Black has serious problems here as we will get a position with opposite-coloured bishops where White is in command. Such positions are long-term suffering for Black: 22...Qd7 23.Re3 (the immediate 23.Ne5 is also good). Black does not have a good solution here. He may try 23...Bxc2 24.Ne5 Bxe5
25.Rxe5 when his best chance to survive is 25...c5! (25...Re8? loses to 26.Rxe8+
Qxe8 27.Bh6 when the combination of Black's weak king plus his weak queenside will prove decisive) 26.dxc5 with a clear advantage for White; B22) A logical alternative for Black is 14...Bf5 15.Re1 c6 16.Nb3 Nc7. White has pressure here, based on his control of the open file. White combines this with targeting Black's queenside pawns: 17.Be5 (17.Na5!? is an alternative) 17...Ne6 (Black's best reaction was probably 17...Bxe5 18.Rxe5 g6, but this position is not entirely equal. White has pressure (e-file, safer king, potential to target Black's queenside pawns)) 18.Na5 Qe7. In Deac-Navara, Riga 2021, there followed 19.b4 Be4 and the game was later drawn. White was tactically not alert and missed a good opportunity with 19.Bxf6! Qxf6 (after 19...gxf6 it's not easy to estimate the size of Black's kingside weakening, but it is certainly an achievement for White) 20.Qb4! and Black does not have a good way to defend his queenside weaknesses, so White wins a pawn. The only way for Black to stay in the game is 20...Qd8! 21.Qxb7 Rb8 22.Qxa7! Ra8 23.Nxc6 Rxa7 24.Nxd8 Rxa2 25.c4! Kf8!. White will be a pawn up, but Black has drawing chances.
13...d5 14.Nd2
14.Bd3 has been tried in a number of top games (including Carlsen-Karjakin during
their World Championship match in New York 2016). Black responds with 14...g6 followed by ...Ng7 and ...Bf5.
14...Bf5
Black has alternatives in 14...c6 and 14...g6.
15.Qe3 c6 16.Re1
White has pressure here, based on his control of the e-file. He will combine it with pushing his kingside pawns. Can Black equalize? Yes, probably. Is it easy? No. Your engine will give you close to zeroes but do not mistake this for 'easy equality'! Black needs to be precise and it is easy to err.
16...h6 17.h3
One top-level game went 17.Qg3 Bg6 (after the logical trade 17...Bg5 18.h4! Bxf4
19.Qxf4 Black still needs to work to equalize fully) 18.Nf3 Qb6
19.b4 (this is not precise and allowing Black counterplay; 19.Re2! followed by Ne5
would have kept Black under pressure) 19...a5! 20.a3 axb4 21.axb4 Qd8. The open a-file gives Black counterplay, and the game was later drawn in So-Aronian, Istanbul ol 2012.
17...Bg5
White does control the e-file, but how to improve? Push the kingside pawns!
18.g4!
The alternative pushing idea is 18.Bxg5 Qxg5 19.f4 (19.g4 Qxe3! is fine for Black, as the queen trade brings him closer to equality here) 19...Qg6 20.g4 Nd6! with ...Re8 to follow - by pushing pawns White has also abandoned a few squares. Black should hold equality here, but in a game between humans, the position looks easier to play for White. The first question for Black is: should he still allow White to take Bxg5, changing the pawn structure, or not? Robson decides not to react.
18...Bg6
18...Bxf4 19.Qxf4 Bc2 was the alternative. After 20.Nf3, the engine will give many
lines that end close to zero. But the position still looks easier to play for White, who controls the e-file and has the plan to push his kingside pawns.
19.Bxg5 hxg5 20.Nf3 f6 21.h4 gxh4
21...Qd7 was the alternative, but White does have an advantage after 22.Bh3 Be4
23.hxg5 Bxf3 24.Qxf3 fxg5 25.Qe3. His command of the e-file matters, while Black
needs to protect his g-pawn and has to worry that the c3-c4 push, bringing White's bishop into play, does not come at an unfortunate moment.
22.Nxh4
22...Be4?
The decisive mistake! Having the pawn on f3 will come in handy for White. The immediate 22...Bh7 was necessary. Now, after 23.Bd3 Bxd3 24.Qxd3 (similar to the game) Black has 24...Nd6!. White's best reply is 25.Nf5 (now 25.Ng6 does not win as Black has an important tempo with 25...Qd7! and 26.Ne7+ - 26.f3 Re8 is equal - 26...Kf7 doesn't give White more than a draw: 27.Qg6+ Kf8 28.Qh5 Re8
29.Qh8+ Kf7 30.Qh5+ Kf8) 25...Nxf5 26.Qxf5 and the position is still not equal but
Black is moving in the right direction.
23.f3 Bh7 24.Bd3! Bxd3 25.Qxd3
Due to White's e-file pressure combined with Black's weak king, Black can no longer be saved.
25...Rc8
25...Nd6 now loses to 26.Ng6! Qd7 27.Ne7+ Kf8 and with his g4-pawn protected,
White now wins with the simple 28.Qh7.
26.Qf5
26.Ng6 also wins (Black's king is simply too weak): 26...Rc7 27.Qe2 Nd6 (or
27...Kf7 28.Qh2) 28.Qe6+ Nf7 and now White has a nice win: 29.Qe8+! Kh7
30.Nf8+ Kg8 31.Nd7+ Qxe8 (31...Kh7? 32.Qxf7) 32.Rxe8+ Kh7 (with this limited
number of pieces, White has a winning attack!) 33.Nf8+ Kh6 34.Re2! Rc8 35.Rh2+ Kg5 36.Rh5+ Kf4 37.Kf2! and White mates on the next move.
26...Nd6 27.Qe6+ Nf7 28.Ng6 Rb8
White has full control! Bogdan Deac first improves his position further.
29.Kg2 Qd6 30.Qf5 Nh6 31.Qh5 a5
How to crush Black? Push pawns!
32.f4! Kh7 33.f5! Kg8 34.Re6 Qc7 35.Ne7+ Kf8
With this final pawn push, Black's defences collapse.
36.g5! Ng8 37.Qh8 1-0
To prevent mate, Black will first lose his queen, and then some. Game 43 Nils Grandelius 2672 David Howell 2646 London ENG-SWE Challenge Match 2022
1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 Nf6 4.O-O Nxe4 5.Re1 Nd6 6.a4!?
As I explained in the comments to the game Deac-Robson, this line, which is still considered to be a relative sideline, has a strategic idea behind it. White hopes that Black will push 6...a6, when he will get a strategically favourable version of the main 6.Ne5 lines. David Howell ignores White and continues developing:
6...Be7
White's positional idea behind 6.a4!? becomes clear in the following continuation:
6...a6 7.Nxe5 Be7 8.Bf1
A) If Black plays 8...O-O, White takes space with 9.d4 Nf5 and here White has a choice between playing for a positional advantage or making an interesting pawn sacrifice. A1) With his development advantage and control of the e-file, White has interesting tactical ideas like the pawn sacrifice 10.Nc3!? Ncxd4 analysis diagram
11.Nd5 (11.g4? is not a piece win due to (simple) 11...Nh4 12.Qxd4 d6). White has
dynamic piece play and Black needs to be careful: 11...Bc5! 12.Nd3 Ba7 13.Qg4 (White has serious threats like 14.c3 or 14.Bg5) 13...Qh4! (13...d6? runs into the textbook tactic 14.Bg5 f6 15.Bxf6! Rxf6 16.Re8+) 14.Qxh4 Nxh4 15.Nxc7 Rb8. The smoke is slowly starting to clear; White does not have more than an a tiny advantage after 16.Be3 (playing for 'domination' with the inspired 16.Bf4 Nxc2 17.Bd6!? Nxe1
18.Rxe1 leads to equality after 18...g6! 19.Nd5 Nf5 and we will probably have a
peaceful outcome; for example, 20.Nf6+ Kg7 21.Bxf8+ Kxf8 22.Ne5 Kg7 23.Ne8+ Kf8 24.Nf6 Kg7) 16...Nhf5 17.Bxd4 Nxd4 18.Nb4 d6; A2) 10.d5 leads to a positional advantage after 10...Nxe5 11.Rxe5 d6 12.Re1 - compare this to the game Carlsen-Aronian (in the comments to Deac-Robson), White has a similar kind of pull here; A3) Another safe road to a small advantage for White is 10.Nf3 d5 11.c3. In general, Black would prefer to have some of the light pieces already traded in positions like these. B) 8...Nxe5 9.Rxe5 O-O 10.d4 Ne8 11.Nc3 Bf6 12.Re1 d5 13.a5!. The advantages White gets by the inclusion of 6.a4 a6 are becoming clear. White will have an advantage on the queenside, where the pawn structure is fixed, plus regular e-file pressure and kingside attack ideas. 13...c6 14.Bf4. B1) Now Aronian, playing Black, went for a standard bishop trade: 14...Bg5 15.Be5 Bf6 16.Qd2 Bxe5 17.Rxe5. White has a good situation here: e-file control, a nice outpost for his knight on the queenside (on c5), and the option to push his kingside pawns like in Deac-Robson. Also, we can compare this position to Grischuk-Gukesh from the comments to Deac- Robson: White has similar trumps here. After 17...Nf6 18.f3 Be6 19.Na4 Qd6 20.b4 Nd7 21.Re3 Rae8 22.Rae1 Black was doomed to passive defence but managed to survive to a draw in Niemann-Aronian, Saint Louis 2022; B2) The silicon brain suggests a radical solution to the problem: 14...b5!?, which is definitely not an easy decision for a human player. White should opt for a pawn sacrifice: 15.axb6! Qxb6 analysis diagram
16.Na4! (another option is 16.Bd3 Bxd4 17.Qd2 when White definitely has
compensation but perhaps not more) 16...Qxd4 17.Qf3 Qa7 18.c3. Black has won a pawn, but his Ne8 is badly placed, the a6-pawn is weak, and his piece coordination is not good. White will play b4 followed by Nc5 and despite the pawn he has better chances here.
7.Nc3 O-O 8.d4!
White has a development advantage and wants to keep the momentum.
8...Nxd4!?
Black accepts the challenge! A huge majority of top players decided on the relatively boring 8...e4 when we get a standard small plus for White after 9.Nxe4 Nxe4
10.Rxe4.
9.Nxd4 exd4 10.Nd5
Due to his development advantage, White has a strong initiative and Black needs to be careful - the price of each move here is high!
10...Re8?
This logical move is a mistake that should have been (almost) losing. Black's best is 10...Bh4!, but this is just the first in a series of accurate moves Black needs to play to keep the balance. Now the move that puts Black most to the test is
11.Bd3 (11.g3 c6 12.gxh4 cxd5! leads to equality, while 12...cxb5?? is a losing
blunder due to 13.Bg5 f6 14.Bf4). A) Pushing a pawn with tempo is usually a good idea in such situations, but here
11...c6 is a losing blunder due to 12.Nc7! and Black's position can no longer be
saved! 12...Qxc7 (12...Rb8? loses prosaically to 13.Bf4 Be7 14.Qe2) 13.Qh5! Bxf2+
14.Kxf2 and Black is three pawns up but cannot develop. One recent GM-level game
continued 14...f5 (14...g6 does not change much; White has various roads to victory here: 15.Qh4 Ne8 16.Bh6 Ng7 17.Re7 and Black's king is too weak while he cannot develop the queenside, giving White plenty of time for the kill) 15.Re7 Ne4+. Now White executes nicely: 16.Kg1! Qd8
17.Rxe4! g6 18.Rg4! fxg4 19.Bxg6 hxg6 (19...Qe7 loses to 20.Bh6 Rf6 - precision
is always important as White has only one way to win here: 21.Bxh7+!) 20.Qxg6+ Kh8. Here White has several wins, but he considers that grabbing a free extra pawn does not hurt: 21.Qh5+ Kg8 22.Qxg4+ Kh7 23.Qh5+ Kg8 24.Qg6+ Kh8 25.Bg5 Qa5
26.Rf1 Rxf1+ 27.Kxf1 1-0 Balakrishnan-Quesada Perez, Chesterfield 2022;
B) Black has only one move to keep the balance: 11...b6! 12.Qg4. Now Black needs another smart move: 12...f5! (12...Bb7? loses to 13.Bh6 Bf6 14.Nxf6+ Qxf6 15.Bg5 and Black's queen is trapped) 13.Qxd4 Bb7 14.Bf4 Ne4. The position is still sharp, but Black should hold the balance.
11.Qg4
Black's problem is his undeveloped queenside. White's development advantage is simply too big here.
11...f5
11...c6! is perhaps the most resilient here, however after 12.Bh6 g6 (12...Bf6 loses to
13.Nxf6+ Qxf6 14.Bg5 Qg6 15.Bd3 f5 16.Qxd4) 13.Nxe7+ Rxe7 14.Bd3 Ne8
15.Qxd4 ...
analysis diagram Black has indeed avoided an immediate annihilation, but his situation is far from good, for example 15...d6 16.Bg5 (16.h4 also looks promising) 16...f6 17.Bd2 and with h2-h4-h5 to follow White has plenty of compensation here, as Black's king is weak while his pieces still coordinate poorly.
12.Qxd4 Bf6
12...c6 now loses to 13.Nxe7+ Rxe7 14.Bg5 and the end picture after 14...Rxe1+
15.Rxe1 Qxg5 16.Qxd6 perfectly illustrates Black's poor development.
13.Nxf6+ Qxf6 14.Bc4+! Kh8 15.Rxe8+ Nxe8
Black has escaped an immediate slaughter, but his queenside is still not developed. White has a winning advantage but, of course, precision is needed! Grandelius lets it slip:
16.Qe3
White should have realised how huge his development is (and it is not diminished after a queen trade) and should have gone for the strong and precise 16.Be3!. Black has to try to develop: 16...d6 (16...c6 loses to 17.Re1 d5 18.Bg5! Qf8 analysis diagram
19.Qc5 Qg8 20.Bd3 - Black cannot develop and will soon lose decisive material; in
Stockfish language this position is plus four). Now White calmly brings on his rook to penetrate the e-file: 17.Re1!. Black has to trade queens: 17...Qxd4 (17...Bd7 loses to 18.Qd5! Qf8 19.Qxb7) 18.Bxd4 Bd7 19.Re7 (White has total domination)
19...Bxa4 (on 19...Rd8, White calmly keeps improving his position with 20.h4)
analysis diagram Black's king is weak, and White now goes for a tactical win: 20.Rf7! h6 21.Rf8+ Kh7 22.Be6! and Black either gets mated or loses a piece: 22...Bxc2 23.Bg8+ Kg6
24.Bf7+ Kh7 25.Bxe8. Black's ordeal is far from over as 26.Bg6+ is to come, so
Black will lose his rook too.
16...Qf8 17.b3
White is still better, but Black now has objective survival chances.
17...Nf6 18.Bb2 d5! 19.Bd3 c5
19...Bd7 was perhaps a better defence.
20.Bxf6 gxf6
21.Qf3
White misses the last chance to make Black's life difficult. Precise was 21.Re1 Bd7
22.Qf4! and Black is still far from a draw as 22...Re8? loses to 23.Rxe8 Qxe8
24.Qd6 or 23...Bxe8 24.Qxf5.
21...Be6 22.Bxf5 Bg8! 23.Re1 Re8 24.Rxe8 Qxe8
White does not have enough material to take advantage of Black's weak king.

8.Rxe5 O-O 9.d4 Bf6 10.Re2!?
This rook retreat is considerably less often played than the main line 10.Re1, but there is definitely logic behind it. White steers the game into slightly different directions as now Black reacts differently.
10...b6
Let's first try to understand the difference with the 10. Re1 retreat. Should Black stick to the same plan and continue 10...Re8, then the rook on e2 offers White a number of advantages because if Black captures ...Rxe2 and White recaptures Qxe2, White's queen will be considerably better placed on e2 than on e1. White has two ways to try to take advantage of this situation: A) 11.Bf4 Rxe2 12.Qxe2. Black is not forced to accept White's pawn sacrifice here, but then White has a risk-free advantage: 12...Bxd4. White has different options (move-orders) here, perhaps the most precise being 13.Bxd6 cxd6 14.Na3. analysis diagram Black needs to try to develop with 14...d5! (grabbing another pawn loses too much time: 14...Bxb2? 15.Re1 Qf8 16.Nb5 - Black cannot complete his development and White soon wins decisive material, e.g. 16...Bf6 17.Nc7 Rb8 18.Qb5! Be7 19.Re3! b6 20.Qe2) 15.Re1 Qf8 16.Nb5 Bb6 17.Nc3! Ba5 18.Qb5 Bxc3 19.bxc3. White gets his pawn back, and Black still needs to develop his queenside, so his problems are not solved yet; B) Another way for White to obtain an edge is 11.c3 and after 11...Rxe2 (we can also use the move-order 11...Nf5 12.Bf4 Rxe2 - not 12...c6?? as with White's rook on e2 instead of e1, this loses on the spot to the simple 13.Bc7! - 13.Qxe2) 12.Qxe2. White's queen being on e2 instead of e1 brings White a couple of advantages: his rook can move directly to e1, exerting immediate e-file pressure, the queen can move to f3 and also White sometimes has Qb5 ideas. For example: B1) If 12...Ne8, White can now take space similar to Carlsen-Aronian (see the comments to Deac-Robson): 13.d5 (another option is 13.Bf4 d5 14.Nd2 and now in case of 14...Bf5 we see the advantage of the queen being on e2: 15.Qb5!) 13...c6 and now it comes in handy for White to have 14.Qf3!, with an advantage in Kovalenko- Omelja, Bialystok 2017; B2) 12...Nf5 13.Bf4 c6. Now White has a good option in 14.g4! Nh4 - thanks to the queen being on e2, this knight jump does not pose any threat, so White can calmly continue 15.Bd6. C) The pawn sacrifice 11.Nc3 is more of a rapid play weapon as Black is fine after
11...Rxe2 12.Qxe2.
Black has to accept the sacrifice: 12...Bxd4! (12...Qe8 leads to an inferior ending for Black after 13.Nd5 Bd8 14.Qf3 Qe4 15.Qxe4 Nxe4 16.Bf4 c6 17.Nc7 Bxc7 18.Bxc7 d5 19.f3 and due to his bishop pair, White had a clear advantage and went on to win in Hansen-Hammer, PRO League rapid 2017) 13.Nd5 c6. Now, White has different ways to get sufficient compensation, but not more: C1) On 14.Bf4, a tactical resource keeps the balance: 14...Bxf2+! 15.Qxf2 Ne4
16.Qd4 cxd5;
C2) Or 14.Ne7+ Kf8 and White has many ideas but nothing substantial, e.g. 15.Bg5 (15.Bf4 Ne8!) 15...f6 16.Nxc8 Rxc8 17.Qd3 Qb6; C3) 14.Nc7 Qxc7 15.Bf4 b6. Now, to keep the momentum, it makes sense for White to sacrifice another pawn: 16.Rd1! (16.c3 looks about equal after 16...Bf6 17.Rd1 Bb7) 16...Bxb2 17.Bxd6 Qd8. White has great domination, but the silicon brain gives zeroes... in human play this can be unpeasant for Black. With the text, Black wants to play ...Ba6 followed by a trade of the light-squared bishops.
11.Re1
McShane first trades a pair of rooks and then develops his Bc8 - probably not the most precise order.
11...Re8
A more accurate development is 11...Bb7. We have a number of top-level games here, most of which end in draws. I would like to explore one a bit further: 12.a4!?. The next few moves are logical: 12...Bg5 13.Nc3 Bxc1 14.Qxc1 Qf6 15.Qd2. An important moment! Black continues his 'trading plan' but this allows White to get an edge: 15...Rae8 (it was better to stop White's a-pawn advance with 15...a5!. David Navara most likely refrained from this decision because he did not like his position after 16.Re5 Rae8 17.Rae1. But Black is able to neutralize White's e-file pressure and equalize with 17...Re6! 18.Nb5 Nxb5 19.Bxb5 and now the 'dynamic defense' 19...Rfe8! 20.Qc3 Rxe5 21.dxe5 Qg6 22.f3 Bc6 with equality) 16.a5!. Now White has an edge. Black continues his 'trading plan': 16...Ne4 17.Nxe4 Rxe4
18.Rxe4 Bxe4 19.Re1 Bf5 20.Qf4 d6.
White has an advantage here, but probably Grandelius did not get the most out of the position. Most precise looks 21.a6! - the e-file is important here! Endings will be unpleasant for Black, for example 21...Be6 22.Qxf6 gxf6 23.Bb5 and Black faces a difficult time (e-file, structural problems, space...). The game went 21.c3 Be6
22.Qxf6 gxf6 and White had an advantage but Black managed to survive in
Grandelius-Navara, Malmö 2022.
12.Bf4 Rxe1 13.Qxe1
A pair of rooks has been traded. Black faces problems similar to other examples in this chapter: White's e-file pressure, space, and Black's bishop on b7 will be passive too. Can Black equalize? Perhaps, but, as in several other examples in this chapter, though the silicon brain evaluates at close to zero, it's not easy in practical human play.
13...Ne8 14.Nc3 Bb7 15.Qd2 d5 16.Re1 Nd6
The counterplay attempt 16...c5 does not bring Black equality after 17.dxc5 bxc5. analysis diagram Due to the badly placed Ne8, this position with hanging pawns in the centre favours White. A) The easy positional way is 18.g3; Black needs to react and White has an advantage after 18...d4 19.Ne4 Be7 20.Bg2 Qb6 21.b3; B) White can also opt for more direct play with 18.Na4 Rc8 (this allows a tactical solution; the alternative 18...c4 also leads to White's advantage after 19.Nc3)
19.Nxc5! Rxc5 20.Qb4 Rxc2 21.Qxb7 and Black's best way to stay in the game is to
aim for an inferior endgame: 21...Bd4 22.Qxd5 Bxf2+ 23.Kh1 Rc8 24.Qxd8 Rxd8
25.Re2 Bb6 26.Rd2 Rc8 27.g3 and Black will struggle for a draw.
17.Bd3
Black goes for immediate counterplay, allowing a nice tactical idea:
17...c5
Changing the central pawn structure with 17...Nc4 18.Bxc4 dxc4 19.Be5 leads to positions that look pleasant for White to me due to the well-placed Nc3 and Black's doubled c-pawns. Probably McShane was thinking the same, but my Stockfish gives close to zeros after 19...Bxe5 20.Rxe5 h6 or immediately 19...h6. An interesting idea was 17...Bxd4!? 18.Bxh7+ Kxh7 19.Qxd4 Kg8. White spots the tactical solution!
18.dxc5! bxc5 19.Nxd5! Bxd5 20.Bxh7+ Kxh7 21.Qxd5
Black is still very much in the game, but precise defense is needed.
21...Be7
A) If 21...Nb5, White grabs a third pawn with 22.Qxf7 and Black's king is weak. After the arguably best 22...Rc8, 23.c3 is better for White, and 22...Bxb2? blunders a piece to 23.Qf5+ Kg8 24.Qe6+ Kh8 25.Qh3+ Kg8 26.Qb3+; B) 21...Ne8 22.Qxf7 Bxb2 does not work for Black due to his weak king: 23.Qh5+ Kg8 24.Rd1 Qc8 25.Qd5+ Kh7 (25...Kh8 loses to 26.Rd3). White has a winning advantage but he still needs to take care: 26.Qe4+! (on 26.Rd3? Black has 26...Nf6!)
26...Kh8 (or 26...Kg8 27.Rd3). Now, with Black's king on the eighth rank, 27.Rd3
wins as 27...Nf6 loses to 28.Rh3+ Qxh3 29.Qxa8+ check!
21...Qa5 was a good defensive resource, e.g. 22.c3
analysis diagram
22...Re8! 23.Rxe8 Nxe8 24.Qe4+ g6 25.Qxe8 Qxa2 - it's not easy to say, but Black
might be closer to a draw than White to a win here. Now White allows Black to escape:
22.Re3
White missed a nice solution with 22.Kf1!. White king is no longer threatened by a back rank mate, while also it will be hiding from checks. Black's best is 22...Rc8 (22...Rb8 loses to 23.Rxe7 Qxe7 24.Bxd6; 22...Kg8 runs into 23.Rxe7) 23.Bxd6 Bxd6 24.Rd1 Qf6 25.Qxd6 Qxb2 26.Qd3+. Now that the smoke has cleared, White is a pawn up in a technical endgame.
22.Bxd6 Bxd6 23.Rd1 leads to a draw after 23...Rb8 24.Qxd6 Qxd6 25.Rxd6 Rxb2.
22...Bf8
This move does not lose, but it forces Black to find a difficult defensive resource a few moves down the road.
22...Rb8! was a relatively easy draw: 23.Bxd6 (23.Rh3+ Kg8 24.Qh5 leads to a draw
by perpetual check with 24...f6 25.Qh7+ Kf7 26.Qh5+ Kf8) 23...Bxd6 (23...Qxd6 leads to a drawn endgame: 24.Qe4+ Kg8 25.Qxe7 Qxe7 26.Rxe7 Rxb2). White's best here is to agree to a draw by move repetition 24.Qh5+ (24.Qxf7 is not mate as Black has 24...Bf4!) 24...Kg8 25.Rh3 Kf8 26.Qe2 Kg8 27.Qh5 Kf8.
23.Rh3+ Kg8 24.Qh5 f6 25.Qh8+ Kf7 26.Qh5+ Kg8 27.g4!
White correctly decides to play on and put Black to the test!
27...Qe8?
The losing mistake. To stay in the game, Black had to come up with a difficult-to- find defensive resource: 27...c4! 28.g5 Qa5!. Black's queen is active and White's king is exposed - Black saves the game! White's best chance is 29.Qh7+ (29.Bxd6 is equal after the easy moves 29...Qe1+ 30.Kg2 Qe4+ 31.Kf1 fxg5=) 29...Kf7 30.Bxd6 Bxd6 31.Qh5+. analysis diagram Black still needs to play a few only moves: 31...Ke6! 32.Re3+ Be5! 33.Qg4+ (or
33.f4 Qd2!) 33...f5 34.Qxc4+ Qd5 35.Qa6+ Qd6 and the game is saved.
28.Qh7+ Kf7 29.Qh5+ Kg8 30.Qh7+ Kf7
Naturally White plays on!
31.Re3! Qc6
As usual, to get to the opponent's king, pawn defences need to be removed:
32.g5! fxg5 33.Bxd6 Bxd6
33...Qxd6 loses to 34.Rf3+ Ke7 35.Qe4+.
34.Qf5+ Kg8 35.Qe6+ Kf8
And White concludes the game with a nice move:
36.Re5! 1-0
A typical Ruy Lopez Breyer position Diagrammed is a typical Ruy Lopez position. This particular position comes from the Breyer Variation but we may get something similar from other closed Ruy Lopez variations. Black has a well-placed knight on the c5-outpost, while White has almost everything else. Many great players, Magnus Carlsen included, have opted for this position as Black. I have some experience with it, and I did not like it because White has different plans while Black does not have clear and easy to execute counterplay. One of White's main plans is to open up the kingside and get an attack there by pushing his f-pawn to f4. The selected game and those included in the comments show White's plans and the problems Black faces in these positions. The f4 push in a closed centre Game 45 Maxime Vachier-Lagrave 2780 Bassem Amin 2704 France tt 2019 In this game I will show a typical type of position coming from the Breyer Variation - as said, similar positions may come from other classical Ruy Lopez variations. The central structure is fixed, Black's knight is (sort of) well placed on c5, while White has many other things! White's main plan is to push the f-pawn to f4, opening up the kingside to get an attack. As a consequence, Black will get a central outpost on e5 (usually for a knight) but nevertheless Black struggles to find active counterplay. I never felt comfortable in such situations as Black and ended up playing a different type of Breyer where the central structure was not fixed with 15...c5 16.d5 c4. This game, and a number of examples given in the comments, illustrate well the kind of problem Black faces or may easily face.
1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 a6 4.Ba4 Nf6 5.O-O Be7 6.Re1 b5 7.Bb3 d6 8.c3 O-O 9.h3
Nb8 10.d4 Nbd7 11.Nbd2 Bb7 12.Bc2 Re8 13.Nf1 Bf8 14.Ng3 g6 15.a4 c5 An important strategic decision, fixing the pawn structure. Black does not have to do this - he can keep the central pawn structure fluid and opt for other main lines here, like for example 15...Bg7.
16.d5 c4 17.Bg5
A typical pawn structure in this line. Black is happy getting his knight to c5, White is preparing a kingside attack, mostly introduced by the with f4 push. White has more space and can combine kingside and queenside plans, as he does in this game. Black's Bb7 often turns out passive, while it is strategically clever for him to trade off his dark-squared bishop - but on the other hand, that bishop protects his king. This strategically complex position has been played in many top-level games. I am personally not really fond of Black's strategy and after years of experience, I think that with this fixed central structure we have to favour White here, primarily due to his space advantage and the options to play on both sides of the board. Let's see how the play develops.
17...Nc5
Black can also place his knight on c5 in a slightly different version: 17...h6 18.Be3 Nc5 and now: A) 19.Qd2 h5 and now: A1) You may wonder what happens if White changes the pawn structure and doubles Black's pawns with 20.Bxc5 dxc5. We have some top-level games here. Yes, White did double Black's pawns, but he has also parted with his bishop pair. White has somewhat better chances. I like the following idea Anish Giri demonstrated in a blitz game: 21.Qe3 Rb8 (White's area of action will be the queenside) 22.Nf1 Bc8 23.N1d2 Bd7 24.axb5 axb5 25.Ra6. Black needs to worry about a timely b3-pawn push by White: 25...Rb6 26.Ra7 Qb8 27.Rea1 Qd6. White is doing great, Anish comes up with a nice idea: 28.Bd1! (28.b3 also leads to White's advantage as the queenside is favourably opened for him after 28...cxb3
29.Bxb3 with 30.c4 to follow and if 30...b4, 31.Ba4 with a favourable bishops trade)
28...Bg7 29.Be2! Reb8 30.Bxc4! (game over!) 30...bxc4 31.Nxc4 Qe7 32.Nxb6
Rxb6 33.b4 Bf8 34.R7a5 Bb5 35.bxc5 Qxc5 36.Qxc5 Bxc5 37.c4 Nxe4 38.Rxb5 and White won easily in Giri-Karjakin, Flor & Fjaere 2014; A2) 20.Bg5. Now where to place black bishop is not an easy choice: 20...Bg7 (20...Be7 is the alternative) 21.Rf1! (White is getting ready to push the f-pawn)
21...Qc7 22.Bh6. Fabiano Caruana faces an unpleasant dilemma: to trade or not to
trade? Both decision do not really look good for Black: 22...Bh8. White now had the right idea, but did not get it done in a precise way:
23.Ng5 (strongest was 23.Nh4!, for example 23...bxa4 24.f4! exf4 25.Rxf4 and
White has a winning attack. In Stockfish language, this is close to plus two) and now: A21) Black's best chance to get counterplay was by timely disturbing White's Ng3 with 23...h4! when after 24.Ne2 bxa4 25.f4 analysis diagram Black does not react in the centre but plays 25...Rab8!. White now struggles to get his attack going: 26.f5 Bc8! 27.Rab1 and here it is clever to trade a pair of rooks (fewer potential attackers, less headache!) 27...a3! 28.bxa3 Rxb1 29.Bxb1. analysis diagram Black's king is safe here, so now he can force the strategically good trade 29...Bg7! with a good game; A22) 23...Nh7 24.Nxh7 (the immediate 24.f4 was strong too) 24...Kxh7 25.Be3 Qe7
26.f4! (it is important to have both rooks on the board as f-file pressure is essential
for a successful attack here) 26...exf4 27.Bxf4 (27.Rxf4 was perhaps even stronger:
27...Be5 28.Raf1!.
analysis diagram A standard situation - Black's king is weak, the Bb7 is out of play, the Nc5 is standing there nicely and doing more or less nothing: 28...Bxf4 29.Rxf4 Nd7
30.Nxh5! and White wins after 30...gxh5 31.Qd1 or 30...Rh8 31.Qf2) 27...Kg8. Now
White doubles on the f-file, so having both rooks on the board is important here:
28.Rf3 Bg7 29.Raf1 Nd7.
Now White traded off the defender with 30.Bh6! Bxh6 31.Qxh6 Qf8 32.Qd2 (32.Nf5 was more efficient) 32...Ne5 33.Rf6 and we have a typical situation. Black has a nice knight on e5, while White has everything else. The knight on the e5-outpost is not enough to hold Black's position. White went on to win in Zherebukh-Caruana, Saint Louis 2017. You may wonder what Fabiano did wrong to get into such trouble? Actually, not much. The position is simply easier to play for White and it is easy for Black to get into terrible trouble. The game we are following was a classical time limit game in the United States Championships. B) White can also play slightly differently, though following a similar plan, with
19.Kh1!? (White plans to push f4 later on and places his king on a better square)
19...Rb8 20.Qd2 h5 21.axb5 axb5
22.Ng5! White is now ready for the f-pawn push: 22...Bg7 23.f4! exf4 24.Bxf4. As
already seen, most of the time Black's counterplay idea in these positions is to timely disturb White's Ng3 and this is what Short, playing Black, does now: 24...h4 25.Nf1 Nh5 26.Be3 Bf6. It looks as if Black has sufficient tactical resources as White's king on h1 can now also come under check. How should White continue? 27.Nh2! Bc8 (the pawn grab
27...Ng3+ is not a good idea here as White develops a strong attack after 28.Kg1
Ncxe4 29.Nxe4 Nxe4 30.Bxe4 Rxe4 31.Ng4: analysis diagram
31...Bg7 32.Ba7! Rxe1+ 33.Rxe1 Ra8 34.Bd4 and Black's king has no defenders, his
Bb7, Ra8 are out of play - actually a typical situation in this line; White has a winning attack) 28.Nhf3 (White has the right idea, but he could have executed it in a better way. Pro-actively removing the king from check first with 28.Kg1! was strong here. You may wonder, after Black's knight jump to g3, what difference does it make? 28...Ng3. analysis diagram Well, it does as White now has a nice tactic: 29.Nxf7! Kxf7 30.Bxc5 dxc5 31.Nf3 and since the e-pawn push is coming, Black will have to give some material back, White has a clear advantage) 28...Ng3+ 29.Kh2 Ncxe4 30.Nxe4 Nxe4 31.Bxe4 Rxe4
32.Ba7! (White did not want to get greedy with 32.Bb6 Qxb6 33.Rxe4 Bf5 when
Black would have some compensation for the exchange) 32...Rxe1 33.Rxe1 Ra8
34.Bd4. White has a promising attack. Black's king is weak, his Ra8 is out of play,
his Bc8 is not doing much and his pawn on h4 is likely to fall... still, Black managed to survive to a draw in Stellwagen-Short, Hoogeveen 2004.
18.Nh2
White can also play a bit differently. Executing a simlar plan starting with 18.Qd2 also looks promising. The Nf3 will move and the f-pawn push will come. A few top games went 18...Be7 19.Bh6 Nfd7. Black's queenside counterplay is rather slow and White can quickly develop a promising attack: A) 20.Nh2 and now: bxa4 A1) In case of 20...Nxa4, the following variation illustrates how easily things can go wrong for Black: 21.Ng4!? (White can of course opt for 21.Bxa4 bxa4 22.Rxa4 a5
23.Be3 with an advantage - here he can combine queenside play with the f-pawn
push) 21...Nxb2. Black is now two pawns up, and White starts action: 22.f4 Bh4 (White has a promising attack, minimally worth the sacrificed material, after
22...exf4 23.Qxf4) 23.Bg5! Bxg5 24.fxg5 Rf8 25.Rf1. Now Black has to react:
25...f6 26.gxf6 Nxf6 27.Nh6+ Kh8 (again, the f-file is important; having both rooks
on the board is essential for White's attack) 28.Rf3 Qe7 29.Raf1. Black cannot hold his kingside, this position is plus three according to Stockfish! It's very easy for Black to get into trouble in these positions!; A2) If 20...bxa4, White goes for the attack with 21.Ng4 (21.Bxa4 also leads to White's advantage) 21...Nb3 22.Bxb3 axb3
23.f4! Black's Bb7 is a 'dead piece'. 23...Nf6. Here, strongest for White was 24.Rf1
with an attack that should have resulted in a full point. The game went 24.Ne3 exf4
25.Bxf4 and White had an advantage but Black survived to a draw in Borisek-Amin,
Batumi 2018. B) Starting off with 20.Rf1 with Nh2 and f4 to follow is fine for White too; C) An example of 'non principled play' by White was seen some years ago at the Qatar masters (with a classical time limit): 20.a5 Bc8!. Now White placed both of his rooks on passive positions because was overly concerned about losing his a-pawn:
21.Ra3? Nb7 22.Rea1 Ndc5. Now White wants to attack, but without rooks it does
not work the same way: 23.Nh2 Bd7 24.Be3 Bh4. Despite placing both his rooks in passive positions, White's worries about the a5-pawn are not over as Black can play ...Na4 and still collect that pawn. Black easily won in Mista-Giri, Doha 2014;
18...h6 19.Be3 h5 20.Qf3 Nh7 21.Qe2 Qc7
Retreating the knight with 21...Nf6 is not an easy move to make but it would have stopped the development in the game.
22.Ngf1!
A strong move! The knight goes to d2 when: a) after the f4 push, the move ...h4 can never disturb White; and b) Black also needs to worry about a timely b4 or b3 pawn push, opening up the queenside.
22...Rab8 23.Nd2 Bc8
23...Nf6 24.Rf1 Bg7 is aimed against the immediate f-pawn push, but White gets the
upper hand with 25.Nhf3 (White wants to play 26.Ng5 followed by f4) 25...Nh7 and now White can switch to queenside action: 26.Ra3 Bc8 27.axb5 axb5 analysis diagram
28.b4! cxb3 29.Nxb3 and Black is in trouble on the queenside: 29...Na4 30.c4 with a
strong initiative.
24.axb5 axb5
MVL correctly feels the time is right!
25.f4! exf4 26.Bxf4 Nf6 27.Qf1!
Well played! 27.Qf2 may look more logical, but after 27...b4! Black's c4-pawn is not hanging.
27...Nfd7
Now after 27...b4 28.Nhf3 (28.Qxc4?! is premature and throws away the advantage after 28...Ba6 29.Rxa6 Nxa6 30.Qxa6 bxc3 31.bxc3 Nxd5) 28...bxc3 29.bxc3 Black's c4-pawn is weak and Black does not have a good way to solve this problem:
29...Rb2 30.Nd4 and the attempt to get counterplay with an exchange sacrifice does
not really work due to 30...Rxc2 31.Nxc2 Ncxe4 (31...Nfxe4? loses to 32.Qxc4)
32.Be3. White stands clearly better here.
28.Nhf3 Bg7
29.Qf2!
White's queen goes to a better square, preparing a doubling on the f-file double. Trading a pair of rooks is in general a good idea for Black (in similar positions) and this is what Bassem now does:
29...Rb6 30.Be3!
Moving the bishop from f4 to d4 is a standard plan for White in such positions!
30...Ra6 31.Rxa6 Bxa6 32.Bd4 Bf8
Black wants to keep the defender and retreats his bishop.
32...Ne5 does not solve Black's problems as White is clearly better after 33.Nxe5!
Bxe5 34.Nf3 and Black does not have a good way to keep his stuff together:
34...Bxd4 35.cxd4 Nd3 36.Bxd3 cxd3 37.Qd2.
33.Rf1 Bh6
34.g4!
A swift execution - damaging the opponent's king defences! The silicon brain points out that 34.Ng5 f6 35.e5! dxe5 36.Bxg6 works as well.
34...hxg4 35.Qh4 gxf3 36.Qxh6
A standard situation: Black's king is weak, his Ba6 is out of play and the Nc5 is standing nicely doing nothing.
36...Ne5 37.Nxf3 Ncd7 38.Ng5 Nf8
The execution is easy tactics, netting White a queen:
39.Nxf7! Qxf7 40.Rxf7 Kxf7
Black cannot build a fortress here.
41.Bd1! Re7
If 41...Bc8, 42.h4 followed by 43.h5 decides.
42.Bg4 1-0
A typical Ruy Lopez piece sacrifice in the centre This position, coming from a recent game, shows a typical piece sacrifice idea available to Black in many closed Ruy Lopez positions. I have tried similar sacrifices as Black and can advise you to explore these ideas. Black sacrifices a piece (usually a knight) to eliminate White's pawn centre. Black gets active play and his mobile pawn centre fully compensates for the sacrificed piece. Game 46 Arthur Pijpers 2465 Max Warmerdam 2602 Utrecht ch-NED 2023 I definitely wanted to include the type of sacrifice described above in this book, but I was looking for a fresh example. Help came from Max Warmerdam, who messaged me while I was writing: 'Hey Ivan, remember the sacrifice idea you were showing us at the Papendal (Dutch Olympic Centre) training last November? I played the same idea in my game yesterday! Have a look!'. Well, I did have a look and indeed - thank you Max, I like the game!
1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 a6 4.Ba4 Nf6 5.O-O Be7 6.Re1 b5 7.Bb3 d6 8.c3 O-O 9.h3
Bb7 10.d4 Re8 11.a3 Less played than 11.Nbd2, but definitely also seen at top level.
11...h6
12.Ba2
There is a positional idea behind this bishop retreat. After pushing 13.d5, White wants to be able to build a pawn chain by playing b3 followed by c4.
12...Bf8
And now indeed White goes on to execute his strategic idea:
13.d5
Where to go with the knight?
13...Ne7
I think this is the best option. A) After 13...Nb8, Shirov, playing White, decided to keep the centre dynamic with
14.c4 (White should have some advantage by building the pawn chain with 14.b3 c6
15.c4) 14...c6. Shirov insists on keeping the centre dynamic: 15.Nc3 bxc4 16.dxc6
Bxc6 (16...Nxc6 was the alternative so as after 17.Bxc4 playing the dynamic
17...Nd4!.
analysis diagram White has some advantage though after 18.Nxd4 exd4 19.Qxd4 d5 20.Bf1 dxe4
21.Be3) 17.Bxc4 Qc7 (17...Nbd7 was better). Shirov does not need a further
invitation and goes for a direct attack! 18.Nh4! Bd7 and now comes a piece sac, the point of the previous move: 19.Nd5! Qxc4 20.Nxf6+ gxf6 21.Qh5. A1) If 21...Kh7, White wins by force with a beautiful variation: 22.b3! (the less forcing 22.Bd2 should bring White success as well) 22...Qxb3 23.Bxh6! Bxh6 analysis diagram
24.Reb1! (Black's queen has to defend the f7-pawn but cannot retreat to e6 due to
the Nf5 jump) 24...Qc4 25.Rb4! Qc3 26.Qxf7+ Bg7. What now? White is two pieces down while the Ra1 hangs with check. 27.Nf5! Qxa1+ 28.Kh2 Bxf5 29.exf5 and White wins, e.g. 29...e4 30.Qg6+ Kg8 31.Qxe8+ etc.; A2) Black played 21...f5 and now the great attacker Shirov missed the strongest continuation: 22.exf5! (the game itself went 22.Bxh6 Bxh6 23.Qxh6 f4 and White emerged victorious in Shirov-Erdös, Terme Catez Ech-tt 2021). The problem is that after 22...Be7 White now needs a strong follow-up: 23.Ng6!. Now Black has to give his extra piece back: 23...Nc6 24.Bxh6 Bxf5 25.Qxf5 Qe6 26.Qxe6 fxe6 27.Nxe7+ Rxe7 28.Rac1 and White is a sound pawn up in a technically won endgame. B) 13...Na7 leads to an easy and typical positional advantage for White after 14.b3 c5 15.c4. White gets a typical safe space advantage: 15...a5 16.a4 b4 17.Nbd2 Nc8 18.Bb1 Ne7 19.Nf1 Ng6 20.Ra2 and Black has no counterplay. He had to struggle for a draw in Ter Sahakyan-Azarov, Sharjah 2022.
14.b3
White sticks to his strategic idea of building a central pawn chain. Playing like Shirov in the comment above does not produce same result as Black's knight is now well placed on e7: 14.c4 c6 15.Nc3 bxc4 16.dxc6 Bxc6 17.Bxc4 Qc7 with equality, e.g. 18.Qb3 Ng6.
14...c6
If 14...c5, White gets an easy advantage with 15.c4! bxc4 16.bxc4 Ng6
17.Bb3! Bc8 18.Ba4 Bd7 19.Nc3. White has a favourable version of the Czech
Benoni, but it was a rapid game and Black later turned things around and even won in Firouzja-Le Quang Liem, Chessable Masters rapid 2021.
15.c4 cxd5 16.cxd5
A critical position! White wants to stabilize the queenside, in the ideal world by pushing 17.b4, and will be having a long-term positional advantage. Max comes up with a very interesting idea, first sacrificing a pawn to sentence White's Ba2 to death, and then sacrificing a piece to remove White's pawn centre, getting dynamic pawns of his own. Black will get only a pawn for his the piece, but White's pieces will coordinate poorly.
16...b4!?
16...a5 was tried before. White continues 17.Nc3 b4 18.Nb5 Qb8 19.a4. White's B
will not stay on a2 forever, it will quickly be improved by Ba2-b1-d3, and White has the advantage here. The immediate sacrifice 16...Nxe4? does not work as the Ba2 is not 'killed' and White has a clear advantage after 17.Rxe4 Nxd5 18.b4! - the most human way.
17.axb4
The silicon brain understands the problem of the passive Ba2 and intially suggests
17.Bd2. Black can now sacrifice the piece but he also has another interesting option
in 17...a5!? (White is hoping for something like 17...bxa3? 18.Nxa3 when his pieces start coordinating excellently; the piece sac 17...Nxe4 18.Rxe4 Nxd5 19.axb4 transposes into the comment to 19.Bd2) 18.axb4 axb4 19.Bxb4 analysis diagram White has grabbed a pawn but has terrible coordination - the Ba2 is dead while the Bb4 is also clumsy. Black should play aggressively: 19...g5!. Now, before developing his knight, White first has to solve the Bb4 problem: 20.Bd2 (20.Nc3?? loses to the simple 20...Qb6 while if 20.Nbd2? the bishop on b4 is also trapped by
20...Nfxd5 21.exd5 Nxd5μ) 20...g4! 21.hxg4 Nxg4 22.Nc3. White's Ba2 is terribly
placed and Black has good compensation after 22...Qb6 23.Be3 Qb4. Now comes the point behind Black's previous move:
17...Nxe4! 18.Rxe4 Nxd5
An interesting position! For the piece, Black got only one pawn, but he has full compensation! Excellent judgement! White's pieces are terribly discoordinated while Black has perfect coordination, combining his active pieces with mobile central pawns. In practice, this position is perhaps easier to play with Black.
19.b5!?
White wants to activate his Ba2 as soon as possible. Another logical move was
19.Bb2, developing the bishop and covering c3 - White wants to play Nbd2. Black,
as usual in such situations, pushes his pawns: 19...f5! 20.Re1 (if 20.Rc4, 20...e4
21.Nd4 e3! and now the only move that keeps White in the game is 22.Nd2!) 20...e4
(20...Nf4 is also possible) 21.Nd4 Qg5. analysis diagram White's king has hardly any defenders, while the Ba2, Bb2 and Nb1 are all doing nothing - an excellent example of White's pieces being only 'technically' on the board while Black's pieces are actually playing. White has to be accurate to stay in the game: 22.h4! (22.Ne2 Nxb4 looks bad for White) 22...Qxh4 23.Nxf5 Qg5
24.Ne3 Nf4. Now finally White develops his Nb1: 25.Nc3 (interestingly, even after
the queen trade 25.Qg4 Qxg4 26.Nxg4 Black still has full compensation as White cannot develop, e.g. 26...Nd3 27.Re2 Rec8 28.Na3 d5) 25...d5. Here, best for White is probably 26.Ne2 when Black has a pleasant choice between going for a line ending in perpetual check or just playing for the attack: 26...Nh3+ (the attacking option was 26...Nd3!? 27.Bd4 Bd6) 27.Kf1 Nxf2 28.Kxf2 Bd6. analysis diagram Unfortunately for Black, he is slowly running out of pieces and a draw will probably be the result after 29.Nd4! Rf8+ 30.Kg1 Qh4 31.Ndf5! Rxf5 32.Nxf5 Qh2+ 33.Kf1 Qf4+ 34.Kg1 Qh2+ 35.Kf1 Qf4+ 36.Kg1 analysis diagram with a draw. Playing for a win is probably asking for too much: 36...Rf8?! 37.Ne7+! Bxe7 (37...Kh7? is not good due to 38.Qh5) 38.Rf1 Qe3+ 39.Kh1. White is not exactly getting mated and his 'big pawn on a2' will become a bishop again one day. If White plays 19.Bd2, we have an unclear game after 19...Qf6! (19...f5?! is not precise because the bishop on d2 covers the e3-square and White is better after
20.Rc4 e4 21.Nd4) 20.Na3 Nf4 21.Rxf4 exf4.
analysis diagram
22.Bb1!. Improving the bishop. Black should now damage White's structure:
22...Bxf3! 23.gxf3 Re5 or 23...d5 and we have an unclear, materially imbalanced
game.
19...axb5
The fancy 19...Nf4 20.Ra4 Nxg2 21.Kxg2 e4 does not work as Black has no good follow-up after 22.Nbd2!.
20.b4
The Ba2 is finally active, but there is still the a-file pin!
20...Ra4!
Black wants to play ...Qa8.
21.Bxd5
White decides to solve the a-file pin tactically. In case of 21.Bd2, the pin is unpleasant for White; for example, 21...Qa8 22.Qb3 Qa6 23.Nc3 Ra3 24.Qb2 Ra8 and after 25.Re2 Nxc3 26.Bxc3 Be7 it is not clear how White is going to unpin.
21...Bxd5
Black wants to keep his strong bishop. The alternative was 21...Rxa1 when we get a different material imbalance that may result in equality: 22.Bxb7 Rxb1 (Black has a viable alternative in 22...Qc7 23.Bb2 Qxb7 and after 24.Re3 Ra4 25.Rb3 we have an unclear game. Black has potentially great central pawns, but it's not easy to push them) 23.Qc2 Ra1 24.Qb2. analysis diagram Of course, Black is not going to allow White to have a great blockading bishop on d5: 24...d5! 25.Rxe5 (25.Qxa1? is wrong as Black forces a better ending with
25...dxe4 26.Bxe4 Qd1+ 27.Kh2 Rc8! 28.Bb2 Qxa1 29.Bxa1 f6. White is in deep
trouble here and can lose in a few moves, e.g. 30.Bd3 Bd6 31.g3 and now White loses a piece after 31...Ra8). Now the storm clears and it all ends peacefully:
25...Rxc1+! 26.Qxc1 Rxe5 27.Nxe5 Qb8 28.Qc6 Qxe5 29.Qxb5 Qe1+ 30.Qf1 with a
draw.
22.Rxa4 Bxe4 23.Ra1 d5
The position looks unclear to me. Yes, at the moment Black only has two pawns for the piece, but Black's central pawns are strong, and the bishop pair is good in this type of position... my Stockfish, however, gives a slight plus to White.
24.Nfd2
The alternative was 24.Nbd2 Bg6 25.Bb2 f6 when the position looks unclear to me, my silicon advisor slightly preferring White.
24...Bg6
24...Bf5! is apparently more precise as after 25.Nc3 Qd7 26.Qb3 the bishop can
change diagonals with 26...Be6.
25.Ra5?
The start of a bad plan. White is too focused on collecting material - he should have focused on his piece development and coordination.
25.Nc3! was needed, and after 25...Bxb4 26.Qb3 Bxc3 27.Qxc3 Qb6 28.Qb3 d4
29.Nf1 the position looks okay for Black to me, though my Stockfish gives White
some plus.
25...d4 26.Rxb5 e4
Black has only one pawn for the piece, and still White needs to find only moves to stay in the game! White probably underestimated his bad piece coordination and the power of Black's pawns:
27.Qb3?
This is a mistake that should have lost the game.
27.Na3 is not good due to 27...e3.
Best was 27.Nc4! but the problem is that after 27...e3! 28.fxe3 Bxb1 analysis diagram Black has his piece back and White looks to be in bad shape. The only way to stay in the game is 29.Re5! (29.exd4 loses nicely to 29...Bd3! and after 30.Qxd3 Re1+ Black either gets mated or loses decisive material: 31.Kf2 Rxc1 or 31.Kh2 Qc7+
32.Ne5 Qxc1) 29...dxe3 30.Qxd8 Rxd8 31.Nxe3 Bxb4 32.Rb5.
analysis diagram Unfortunately for White, he does not win a piece: 32...Rc8! 33.Rxb4 Rxc1+ 34.Kf2 and Black is a pawn up, although White might draw.
27...e3!
All White's pieces are uncoordinated and on the wrong side of the board; the white king fights alone. Black has a decisive attack.
28.Nf3 Qc7
White now has to make a sad move, removing another piece from the defence of his king.
29.Ba3 Bc2 30.Qb2
Black has a winning attack, but precision is still needed. Now comes the first missed win.
30...Bd3
30...exf2+ 31.Kxf2 Bd1! was winning on the spot as White cannot bring his pieces to
the defence of his king 32.Qxd4 (giving back a piece with 32.Re5 only delays resignation as after 32...Rxe5 33.Nxe5 Qxe5 Black still has a mating attack)
32...Re2+ 33.Kf1 Qg3 and White gets mated: 34.Qg1 Rc2.
31.Ra5 Qf4?
The second win was more difficult than the first one: 31...exf2+ 32.Kxf2 (32.Qxf2 loses to the simple 32...Bxb1 and Black has his piece back while his mating attack continues as White's Ba3 and Ra5 are still terribly placed). analysis diagram Black has a winning position, but in time pressure (which is likely to be the case) it's not easy to find 32...Re3! with the terrible threat of 33... Rxf3! which, after a series of checks, will mate the white king. It's also not easy to understand that after
32...Re2+ 33.Qxe2 Bxe2 34.Kxe2 Qc4+ 35.Kf2 White's pieces are so poorly
coordinated that he will start losing material after 35...Bd6 36.Nbd2 Qc3.
32.fxe3 Qxe3+ 33.Kh1
33...Qe1+!
Not the best move, but it deserves an exclamation mark for its artistic beauty! Objectively stronger was 33...Bd6 (34...Qe1+ is a threat) 34.Qc1 Bf4!. White has to give his piece back with 35.Qxe3 dxe3 36.Nc3 e2 37.Ne1 Bg3 38.Nxe2 Bxe1. Black is clearly better; White's struggle continues.
34.Nxe1 Rxe1+ 35.Kh2 Bd6+ 36.g3 Be4
This is the position Max had in mind - White is a full queen up but the position is objectively equal! Very probably, both players were under terrible time pressure now. White makes it easy for Black:
37.Qg2?
This prevents mate but gives Black a risk-free advantage. The only (and much better) alternative was 37.Qc1! when Black's next two moves are forced: 37...Re2+ 38.Kg1 Bxg3. analysis diagram An amazing position! Yes, Black does threaten many checks but there is no immediate mate and White is still a full queen up! White's pieces are so poorly coordinated that the position is dynamically balanced: A) 39.Ra8+ leads to a forced draw after 39...Kh7 40.Re8 Rg2+ 41.Kf1 Rf2+
42.Kg1=;
B) 39.Nd2 leads to a forced draw: 39...Rg2+ 40.Kf1 Rf2+ 41.Ke1 Rh2+ 42.Kd1 Rh1+ 43.Ke2 Rh2+=; C) 39.Qc8+ Kh7 40.Rf5!. analysis diagram White is bringing in defenders. There is no mate or perpetual but now the d-pawn is Black's trump! 40...d3! (40...Rh2? blunders into 41.Rf3!; Black does have a threat and it is mate in two: 41...Bh2+ followed by 42...Bg2#) 41.Rf3! Re1+! 42.Kg2 Rxb1. analysis diagram Again, an amazing position! Black does not have an immediate deadly threat and for the queen has only a bishop - and a strong passed pawn! C1) After 43.Kxg3 White is again a full queen up, but... 43...d2! and now the only move is 44.Qc4! f5! (or 44...Rg1+ 45.Kf4 d1Q 46.Qxe4+ g6 when the engine gives zeroes... human play is obviously a different story) 45.Rf1 Re1 46.Qd4! and now we get a different kind of material imbalance after 46...Rxf1! 47.Qxd2 Rf3+ 48.Kh2 Rxa3 and the evaluation is zeroes, but probably it's easier to play for Black; C2) If 43.Bc1, 43...Be1! keeps the pins, threats, and the balance; C3) 43.Qc4 f5! 44.Qa2 (44.Kxg3 transposes to the dynamically balanced line we had in the comment above: 44...d2 45.Rf1 Re1 46.Qd4 Rxf1 47.Qxd2 Rf3+ 48.Kh2 Rxa3) and again we transpose to the positions from the comments above after 44...d2
45.Qxd2 Rb3 46.Kxg3 Rxf3+ 47.Kh2 Rxa3.
37...Bxg2 38.Kxg2 Rxb1
Black now has a risk-free endgame advantage.
39.Rd5 Bc7
Probably a better decision was to go for a rook ending with 39...Bxg3 40.Kxg3 Rb3+.
40.b5 Rb3 41.Bd6 Bb6
White can save the game but needs to be precise:
42.Be5?
A losing blunder. 42.h4!, preventing Black from pushing ...g5 and thus securing the bishop on f4, saved the game, e.g. 42...f6 43.h5.
42...f6!
White's bishop is running out of a good squares.
43.Bf4 g5! 44.Bb8
Or 44.Bc1 Rc3.
44...d3
Black's d-pawn queens.
44...Kf7 also wins.
45.g4 Ba5 46.Kf3 d2+ 47.Ke2 Rb1 0-1
Zaitsev dynamics I have decided to conclude this book with a famous game. The diagrammed position shows a principled battle between the two great Ks. Anatoly Karpov loved this structure as Black since it is fundamentally sound while offering Black active play. There is some resemblance with the Benoni, but the pieces are placed differently. Black wants to plant one of his knights on d3, gaining the bishop pair, and often doesn't mind sacrificing a pawn in the process. Black also has the idea of pushing ...f5, hitting White's centre. Black's potential problem? His weak king. Anatoly Karpov was famous for defending his king with a minimum of resources and has done so throughout his matches with Kasparov. I advise the reader to go through their match games while paying attention to this strategy of 'minimum resources' - it will be both interesting and rewarding! Game 47 Garry Kasparov 2740 Anatoly Karpov 2705 London/Leningrad Wch m 1986 In their heritage World Championship matches, the two great Ks battled out a principled 'Zaitsev Variation' fight, and this game is the one I like the most. You may wonder why I included this 'over-analysed' game in my selection... Well, I would like to offer some personal insights and hope they will be beneficial to the reader.
1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 a6 4.Ba4 Nf6 5.O-O Be7 6.Re1 b5 7.Bb3 d6 8.c3 O-O 9.h3
Bb7 10.d4 Re8 11.Nbd2 Bf8 12.a4 h6 The main line Zaitsev - the battleground of the two great Ks!
13.Bc2 exd4 14.cxd4 Nb4 15.Bb1 c5 16.d5 Nd7 17.Ra3
Over the years, Anatoly Karpov, not only against Kasparov but also in many of his other games, would be choosing here between two principled but strategically rather different options. I like Black's choice in this game, and I think it is enough for equality.
17...c4!
I like Black's ideas here. Black wants to jump ...Nc5 followed by ...Nd3, forcing White to part with his bishop pair. Without his light-squared bishop, White will find it more difficult to build up an attack. Bear in mind, however, that in this game, and often in this line, Black is going to be defending with a minimum of resources! The other principled choice is 17...f5. Black weakens his kingside but wants to eliminate White's pawn centre. The reason why we no longer see this variation at top-level events is the silicon brain's suggestion 18.g4! (Kasparov's choices were
18.Rae3 or 18.exf5). In the few top-level games played with this move, White has
had excellent results. The idea is that 18...fxg4 (to readers willing to invest more time in analysing this position, I would say that in my opinion the positions after
18...f4! are more complicated than the initial computer evaluations tell us) is
answered with 19.Nh2! and White swiftly gets a strong attack. White is now on an important crossroads; he has to chose between three main continuations. I will try to provide some middlegame insight combined with opening information. In this game, Garry attacks Black's pawn on b5 while keeping the option of swinging his Ra3 to the kingside, which is a typical attacking idea in this line.
18.Nd4
A) The alternative, also seen in the K-K matches, is 18.axb5 axb5 19.Nd4. Now Black should eliminate White's attacking rook: 19...Rxa3! (ignoring the danger by playing 19...Qb6 20.Nf5 Ne5 is rather risky as after 21.Rg3! White develops a strong attack, a great example being the game Anand-Adams, San Luis Wch 2005)
20.bxa3 and now is the time for Black to kill White's light-squared bishop: 20...Nd3!
21.Bxd3 cxd3 and the position is about equal. 22.Bb2. Here, modern theory prefers
22...Nc5! (the old classic was 22...Qa5 23.Nf5 Ne5 with complicated play, White
emerging victorious in Kasparov-Karpov, London/Leningrad 1986). In one relatively recent top-level test, White hoped for a kingside attack but it did not materialize and White got in trouble: 23.Re3. The defences of Black's king are limited, but in this game White's attack does not get off the ground: 23...Qa5. White now goes for a sophisticated 'prophylactic attacking move': 24.Kh2 (more straightforward alternatives are 24.Nf5 or 24.Rg3) 24...b4 25.N4b3 Qa4 26.axb4?! (the start of White's problems; he had to opt for 26.Rg3! Nxe4 27.Nxe4 Rxe4
28.Qf3) 26...Qxb4 27.Nxc5 dxc5 28.Qc1 c4 and Black's pawns are strong. Black
was better and went on to win in Huschenbeth-Bu Xiangzhi, Douglas 2019. B) Modern theory follows the silicon brain's suggestions, and top-level games currently feature 18.Ree3!?. The rook runs away from ...Nd3 tempi and is ready to switch to the attacking square g3. We have quite a number of recent top-level games here. The position is very sharp, and probably dynamically balanced. I advise readers interested in theoretical verdicts to investigate in the direction of 18...Nc5! 19.b3 and now: B1) 19...Rc8 leads to White's advantage after 20.axb5 axb5 21.bxc4! (now the Ra3 is fully in play) 21...bxc4 22.Bb2 Nbd3. White now went for a pawn grab with
23.Nxc4 (also promising is 23.Bd4 - White wants to grab the pawn on c4 for free, so
Black has to react: 23...f5 24.exf5 Bxd5 25.f6! and Black is reminded of his potentially weak king) 23...Nxb2 24.Nxb2 g6 25.Na4 Nd7 26.Bd3 and White is a sound pawn up but Black managed to hold a draw in Ivic-Fedoseev, Krasnaya Polyana 2021; B2) Black should sacrifice a pawn with 19...c3! 20.Rxc3, and as a result of the pawn sac, the Ra3 is out of play so Black can open up the position further with 20...f5! with complicated play; Black won in Aravindh-Visakh, Moscow 2020.
18...Qf6 19.N2f3
Karpov now continues his plan to plant the knight on d3:
19...Nc5 20.axb5
A) White has an interesting alternative in 20.Ree3!? with ideas similar to 18.Ree3. We have here an interesting rapid game Anand-Kasimdzhanov played in the final match of a Corsica K.O. event: 20...Nbd3. A1) Here, White had an interesting option in 21.Bxd3 and if 21...b4 (Black has alternatives in 21...cxd3 or 21...Nxd3), White sacrifices an exchange with 22.Bc2! bxa3 23.bxa3. Now Black has to stop Bb2 with 23...c3 and White has sufficient compensation, we have an unclear game after 24.a5 or 24.Ne2; A2) In the game, White went for a pawn grab: 21.axb5 axb5 22.Nxb5 Rxa3 23.Nxa3 Rxe4 24.Nxc4. analysis diagram Rustam now went for an interesting tactical idea, taking a risk: 24...Nxf2!? (24...Rxc4 25.Bxd3 Nxd3 26.Rxd3 Qf5) and it paid off as Vishy now blundered:
25.Qe2? (White had to continue with 25.Kxf2 Rxc4 26.b3! when the black rook does
not have any good squares so an exchange sac is needed: 26...Rxc1! 27.Qxc1 Bxd5 and Black has decent compensation, perhaps White has some plus). Now the tactics are working for Black: 25...Nxh3+! 26.gxh3 Qg6+ 27.Kf2 Rxe3! 28.Bxe3 Qxb1 and Black was material up and went on to win in Anand-Kasimdzhanov, Bastia rapid 2006; B) 20.b3 Nbd3 21.Bxd3 Nxd3 leads to satisfactory play for Black. The position is dynamic while the Ra3 still needs yet to be brought into play.
20...axb5 21.Nxb5 Rxa3 22.Nxa3 Ba6
We have a typical situation for this line. White is a pawn up, Black has the bishop pair and will have a strong knight on d3. The evaluation? A dynamic balance. My personal preference? Black. Kasparov improves his rook and moves away from ...Nd3 tempi:
23.Re3
Karpov says: 'The b2-pawn will be mine.' Please note that Black is not concerned about his king safety and will use a minimum of forces to defend his monarch!
23...Rb8
The alternative was 23...Nbd3!?. White understands that his chances are connected to a kingside attack:
24.e5! dxe5 25.Nxe5 Nbd3
A) 25...Ncd3 was the alternative, covering c2; B) 25...Nxd5!? was an interesting tactical option. B1) 26.Qxd5 leads to a forced draw: 26...Rd8 27.Qf3 Qxf3 28.Nxf3 Nb3!. Black gets his piece back and it ends peacefully: 29.Ba2 (hanging on to the piece with
29.Re1 Bb4 30.Rf1? is not a good idea as Black wins after 30...c3 31.bxc3 Bxa3
32.Bxa3 Bxf1) 29...Nxc1 30.Bxc4 Bxa3 31.Bxa6 Bxb2 with a draw;
B2) I guess Karpov did not like 26.Ng4 when the engine shows zeroes, but to a human the position looks dangerous for Black as the defending forces around his king are limited: 26...Qd6! 27.Rg3 Kh8 28.Qc2 Nd3! 29.Nxc4 Bxc4 30.Qxc4 Nxc1
31.Qxc1. Here, Black is active enough to compensate for the pawn deficit: 31...Nf4
32.Re3 Qd4 with a probable draw.
26.Ng4
One of many critical moments in this game! 26.Qc2! was a better move.
26...Qb6!?
Totally unconcerned about his king safety, Karpov moves another piece away from his monarch. He had a strong resource in 26...Qf5! when Black is better! White has a lot of tactics here but none seems to work, e.g. 27.Rf3 (or 27.Rg3 Kh8) 27...Qxd5. analysis diagram The pawn on b2 will fall, and White does not seem able to create enough on the kingside - after all, his Na3 is out of play while his Bb1 is blocked by Black's Nd3: A) 28.Nf6+? does not work due to 28...gxf6 29.Rg3+ Bg7 30.Bxh6 Ne6 and Black wins with 31.Nxc4 (or 31.Rxg7+ Nxg7 32.Qg4 Kf8) 31...Ndf4!; B) 28.Bxh6 loses to 28...Ne4! and now the Bh6 hangs there is no good retreat:
29.Bc1? Bxa3;
C) After 28.Rg3, now the engine is not afraid to lose a pawn on h6: 28...Qe6! (or
28...Ne4! 29.Nxh6+ Kh8 and Black is better; the safe human move 28...Kh8 is fine
but perhaps it promises no more than a draw after 29.Ne3) 29.Nxh6+ Kh8 30.Re3 Qd7 and Black is better; his Nd3 is simply too strong.
27.Rg3 g6 28.Bxh6
Cold blooded Karpov goes for his pawn:
28...Qxb2 29.Qf3!
Again, a critical moment! White obviously has an attack but, also obviously, he will lose at least a piece - his Na3.
29...Nd7
Anatoly brings one defender closer to his king. The first question, however. is: Can Black grab 29...Qxa3 ? The answer is yes! 29...Qxa3! leads to a draw by perpetual check: 30.Nf6+ Kh8 31.Qh5 Rxb1+ 32.Bc1+ (32.Kh2 leads to a draw too:
32...Rh1+! 33.Kxh1 Nxf2+ 34.Kg1! Qxg3 and White has to force perpetual check
with 35.Bg7+ Kxg7 36.Ne8+) 32...Kg7. There is no mate, so White has to agree to a draw: 33.Ne8+ Kg8 34.Nf6+. Most probably Karpov calculated these lines but rejected them, considering that his position should offer him more. Garry now needs to show great attacking skills indeed!
30.Bxf8 Kxf8
White does not have any immediate threats while he is about to lose decisive material. Kasparov now plays the famous 'prophylactic attacking king move':
31.Kh2!!
Now, in crucial lines, the bishop on b1 will not hang with a check! The position is extremely complicated, and objectively dynamically balanced. It's one of those typical positions where the better calculator wins! Karpov goes for material gain, continuing his strategy of 'minimum defensive resources'. In a World Championship match with one of the greatest attackers in history, using such a strategy takes great confidence!
31...Rb3
A) A player concerned about his king safety may play 31...Qd4. Without the Bb1 and Na3 White can't expect his attack to succeed and a draw is a likely outcome, e.g.
32.d6 (or 32.Qe3 Qxe3 33.Nxe3 Nxf2 34.Bxg6 fxg6 35.Rf3+ Ke7 36.Rxf2 c3 when
the play is still sort of dynamic but a draw is likely) 32...N7e5 33.Nxe5 Nxe5
34.Qc3=;
B) The piece grab 31...Qxa3?? is a blunder: 32.Nh6 N7e5 (or 32...f5 33.Rxg6)
33.Qf6! and White wins as 34.Rxg6 is a terrible threat, e.g. 33...Qb2 34.Rxg6 Ke8
35.Rg3 etc.;
C) Trading an attacker, the Ng4, also makes sense: 31...N7e5 32.Nxe5 Qxe5 and we get a drawn ending after 33.Nxc4 Bxc4 34.Bxd3 Bxd3 35.Qxd3 Rd8.
32.Bxd3 cxd3
Bringing the rook closer with 32...Rxd3 leads to a better ending for White: 33.Qf4 Qxa3 34.Nh6 Qe7 35.Rxg6 Qe5 36.Qxe5 Nxe5 37.Rxa6 Rxd5 and White is a pawn up; the c-pawn is dangerous.
32...Rxa3!, taking the 'insignificant' Na3, is not an easy move to make; it leads to
equality after 33.Qf4 Rxd3 34.Qd6+ Kg7. analysis diagram Which piece to collect? 35.Qxd7! (after 35.Qxa6? Rxg3 36.fxg3 c3 the c-pawn is too strong) 35...Rxg3 36.fxg3 Bb7! (36...c3? is not good as Black's king is weak: 37.Qc7 c2 38.Ne5) with a drawn queen ending after 37.Ne3 Qd4 38.Qxb7 Qxe3=.
33.Qf4
33...Qxa3?
The losing mistake! Karpov probably missed White's 37th move.
33...d2! was needed. This is difficult to calculate and the game was also in the time
trouble phase. Black seems to be able to hold! 34.Nh6 Nf6! (34...Qf6? blunders the pride of Black's position after 35.Qxd2!) A) Now 35.Qd6+ looks very temping but does not win: 35...Ke8 36.Qxa6 d1Q!
37.Qc8+ Ke7 38.Qc5+ Kd7 39.Qc6+ Ke7. Now the only way to continue the fight is
40.d6+!.
analysis diagram And now the cold-blooded 40...Kf8! (Most players will play 40...Qxd6 but after
41.Qxd6+ Kxd6 42.Nc4+ Ke7 43.Nxb2 Rxb2 44.Rf3! Black still needs to work for
the draw) 41.Qc8+ Kg7. Black has a massive material advantage, but his king is defended with a 'minimum of resources': 42.Nf5+ Kh7 43.Qf8. analysis diagram Black stays alive with 43...Ng4+! 44.Rxg4 (44.hxg4 is not a winning attempt as Black has 44...gxf5 45.f3 Rxf3! and the outcome will be a draw after 46.Qxf7+ Qg7
47.Qxg7+ Kxg7 48.Rxf3 fxg4 49.Rg3 Qxd6 50.Nc2 etc.). Luckily for Black, he has
enough material to give! 44...Rxh3+! 45.Kxh3 Qh1+ 46.Kg3 Qe5+ 47.Rf4 g5
48.Qxf7+ Kh8 49.Qf8+ Kh7.
analysis diagram White still has a funny winning attempt here: 50.Qe7+!? Qxe7 51.dxe7 gxf4+
52.Kxf4
analysis diagram Only White can play for a win here, so Black should now secure a funny draw by stalemate with 52...Qxg2 53.e8Q Qg4+ 54.Ke5 Qe4+ or 54.Ke3 Qe2+; B) 35.Rxb3 Qxb3 36.Qxf6 Qxd5. The d-pawn is strong and Black's king is weak:
37.Nxf7 d1Q 38.Nd6+ Kg8 39.Qxg6+ Kf8 40.Qf6+ Kg8.
analysis diagram
41.Nf5! Qxf5 42.Qxf5 Qd6+ 43.Kg1 Qxa3 White will obviously try here for a bit but
the game should end in a draw.
34.Nh6 Qe7 35.Rxg6 Qe5
The defensive resource Karpov was banking on - White's queen is pinned!
36.Rg8+ Ke7
And now comes the famous move that destroys Black's coordination!
37.d6+!
Black will now first lose his queen, and then some.
37...Ke6 38.Re8+ Kd5 39.Rxe5+ Nxe5 40.d7 Rb8 41.Nxf7 1-0
Show in Text Mode Chapter 7 Exercises Exercise 1 - easy Black to move How should Black proceed? What is the right plan for Black here? Show/Hide Solution Solution 1 Answer: Black first needs to fix the central pawn structure, gain space, and remove White's Bd3 from its good post:
12...c4! 13.Be2
Now, activating the bishop on c8 is the right answer. Korchnoi (in his game vs Mecking, Beverwijk 1978) did it in the most precise way:
13...Qa5 14.Bd2 Bd7
Black has a clear plan (improving his bishop) and is at least equal. Exercise 2 - easy White to move With this fixed Winawer pawn structure, is it clever for White to take immediate action with 11.h5 and after the forced 11...g5 play 12.f4, quickly opening up the kingside? Show/Hide Solution Solution 2 This pawn structure can be compared to that in Almasi-Beliavsky and Karjakin- Grischuk elsewhere in this book. This game is another example of how easily even a very strong player can go wrong in these strategically complex positions. Answer: No, it is not as after
11.h5?! g5 12.f4?
White's queen on g4 is badly placed and Black responds with
12...f5!
and is better as after
13.Qg3
(in case of 13.exf6 Nxf6, Black develops fast and takes the initiative)
13...g4
the kingside is fixed and White's bishop pair is useless, while Black has the advantage on the queenside. Exercise 3 - easy White to move Black has already castled and arguably has a development advantage. He wants to open up the centre with the standard push ...f6. Should Black be happy with his position here? Show/Hide Solution Solution 3 Answer: No! White knight is still on its initial g1-square so White can comfortably keep the center closed:
11.f4!
White now simply rolls his kingside pawns, while Black does not have any meaningful counterplay. White has a clear advantage. Exercise 4 - easy/medium Black to move White has grabbed a pawn, but is his queen getting trapped? Evaluate the position. Show/Hide Solution Solution 4 Answer: Yes, it is!
17...Rhg8 18.h3
Or 18.a4 Rdf8 19.Qh7 Nce7 with ...Rh8 or ...Rg7 to follow.
18...Rdf8 19.Qxf8+ Rxf8 20.hxg4 Nfe7
And Black soon won in Almasi-Beliavsky, Hungary tt 1996. Exercise 5 - medium Black to move Kasparov had his bishop on d3 and has just played Be4. Was this a good decision? Show/Hide Solution Solution 5 Answer: No, it was not because due to White's back rank problems this blunders a piece:
45...f5! 46.Bxf5 Ra8
Luckily for White, his piece blunder was not fatal and he escapes into a drawn ending:
47.Bb1 Qb2 48.h4 Ra1 49.Kh2 Qxb1 50.Qxe5 Qh1+ 51.Kg3 Qe1+ 52.Qxe1 Rxe1
With a theoretically drawn ending, though a number of mistakes were still made before White eventually saved a draw in Kasparov-Kramnik, Moscow 2001. Exercise 6 - easy/medium White to move White's chances are clearly on the queenside, but how to proceed? Propose three candidate moves for White. Show/Hide Solution Solution 6 Answer: White has a great position (a clear advantage) and a number of options. It is very good if one of your three candidate moves was the thematic exchange sacrifice:
14.Rb4! Nxb4 15.axb4
And White's pawn avalanche will run Black over, Shirov-Zs.Polgar, Pardubice 1994. Exercise 7 - medium White to move White is doing great on the queenside. Black has just pushed 20... h3, trying to create counterplay. How should White react here? Show/Hide Solution Solution 7
21.gxh3!
Black has many tactical ideas that don't work, White has a large advantage here. In the actual game (Agrest-Nisipeanu, Batumi Ech-tt 1999) White reacted with
21.g3?. Now Black's pawn will stay on h3 until the end of the game and due to the
weakness of White's king Nisipeanu managed to save the game: 21...axb5 22.cxb5. Putting his queen on c7 was not a good idea for Black in the first place. 22...Qd8!. White now creates a strong passer on c6 and may have thought he had a winning advantage... 23.Bxe5 dxe5 24.Qxd8 Rexd8 25.Nc6 Bxc6 26.bxc6 ... but Black saves the game due to White's weak king - the pawn on h3 doing an excellent job:
26...Rd2 27.Ba6 (or 27.Bf1 Rbb2 28.Ne2 Bd8! 29.c7 Bxc7 30.Rxc7 Rxe2 31.Bxe2
Rxe2 with a draw as in the game) 27...Rbb2 (the silicon brain will tell you 27...Ne8 was good as well, but the text is more human) 28.Ne2 Bd6 29.c7 Bxc7 30.Rxc7 Rxe2 31.Bxe2 Rxe2. analysis diagram White king is 'in the box' and the extra exchange does not matter here. 32.Rf1 g5
33.g4 Kg7 34.Kg1 Rg2+ 35.Kh1 Re2 36.Rc3 Nd7 37.Rfc1 Rf2 38.Kg1 Rg2+
39.Kh1 Rf2 1⁄2-1⁄2
Exercise 8 - medium White to move Anatoly Karpov was famed for defending with a 'minumum of resources'. Here he has gone a step too far. How did Judit Polgar destroy Karpov here? Show/Hide Solution Solution 8 Answer: Judit went for the famous 'Lasker sacrifice':
25.Bxh7+! Kxh7 26.Qh5+ Kg8 27.Bxg7!
Exercise 9 - medium/advanced White to move This position could have come from the game Ponomariov-Kramnik, Wijk aan Zee
2005. The position looks complicated; Black has just sacrificed an exchange on c4.
Can you find the win for White here? 'Mating net imagination' helps! Show/Hide Solution Solution 9 Answer: White crushes Black with
26.f5!!
and Black does not have a good response as
26...Ne5
runs into a nice mating net:
27.Rxg7+! Kxg7 28.f6+ Kg8 29.Rh8+! Kxh8 30.Qh1+ Kg8 31.Qh6 Qf8 32.Ne7+
Qxe7 33.Qg7# Exercise 10 - medium White to move White (Kasparov) is doing great here. Can you find an 'instant kill' for White? Show/Hide Solution Solution 10 Answer: White gets the job done with a 'single swipe of his sword':
27.Ng4!!
Black resigned as mate or decisive material loses cannot be avoided, Kasparov- Lautier, Moscow 1994. For example: 27...Rxg5 28.Nxe5, 27...Qe6 28.Rd8! or
27...fxg4 28.Qxe5+.
Exercise 11 - advanced Black to move Black has a winning attack, but precision is needed. There is only one road to victory here! Try to calculate a win for Black without moving pieces. Show/Hide Solution Solution 11 In their game in Belgrade 1989, Nigel Short could have posed Zdenko Kozul more 'execution problems' by playing 28. Rxd6. Answer: You did very well if you calculated this line correctly:
28...Rb2+! 29.Kxb2 Qa2+ 30.Kc1 Qa1+ 31.Kd2 Ra2+ 32.Ke3
Now Black needs a last precise check - you did an excellent job if you saw it from the starting position:
32...Qc3+!! 33.Rd3
Or 33.Bd3 Qd2+ 34.Kf3 when Black can afford the luxury to take everything:
34...Qxg2+! 35.Ke3 Qd2+ 36.Kf3 Qxh6.
33...Qxe1+
And again White loses everything:
34.Kf3 Qe2+ 35.Kg3 Qxg2+ 36.Kh4 Qxe4+
Exercise 12 - advanced Black to move Black has a typical powerful Rauzer attack. However, he has sacrificed a piece. White's Rh3 and Ng3 are out of play but this may quickly change. How should Black proceed here? Try to calculate as far as you can. Show/Hide Solution Solution 12 Answer: White's pawn defences need to be removed! It is excellent if you managed to calculate the winning line until the end:
29...Rxa2!! 30.Bxa2
30.Kxa2 runs into a forced mate: 30...Qa5+ 31.Kb1 Qa1+ 32.Kc2 Be1+! 33.Kd3
Qa6+ 34.Bc4 Rxc4 35.Ke2 Rxe4#. Now the logical follow up is to clear the path to annihilate White's king:
30...b3! 31.Bxb3 Qa3 32.Kc2 Qb2+ 33.Kd3
Black has only one way to win here! It is great if you found this win calculating from the starting position. If not, test yourself here.
33...Ba5! 34.Bc4 Rxc4! 35.Ne2
35.Kxc4 runs into checkmate: 35...Qc2+ 36.Kb5 Qc5+.
35...Qc2+ 36.Ke3 Bb6+
And White resigned in Hou Yifan-Li, Danzhou 2011. Exercise 13 - advanced White to move White has sacrificed a piece for a great attack. The rook lift 23.Re3 has excellent chances to succeed, however a forced win is always much more desirable. Can you find a forced win for White here? Show/Hide Solution Solution 13 Answer: You did great if you spotted the following forced win:
23.Bxh6! Bxh6
Black's queen defends the crucial f7-square, so it needs to be removed from its post:
24.Reb1!
24.Re3? loses to 24...Qc4 25.Rf3 Kg7! 26.Rg3+ Bg5.
24...Qc4
24...Qc3 loses to 25.Qxf7+ Bg7 26.Nf5 Bxf5 27.Qh5+! Bh6 (or 27...Kg8 28.Qxe8+
Bf8 29.exf5+-) 28.Qxf5+ Kg8 29.Rb7 Qxa1+ 30.Kh2 and Black, though a rook and two pieces up, cannot prevent checkmate, e.g. 30...Bf4+ 31.g3 Bxg3+ 32.Kg2.
25.Rb4! Qc3 26.Qxf7+ Bg7 27.Nf5! Qxa1+ 28.Kh2
Though being massive material up, Black cannot save this position either:
28...Bxf5 29.exf5
And White wins:
29...e4 30.Qg6+ Kg8 31.Qxe8+
Exercise 14 - medium/advanced Black to move Black has sacrificed a full rook. How should he continue? Try to visualize/find a mating net. Show/Hide Solution Solution 14 Answer: It's good if you spotted the mating net Petrosian weaved here:
49...Qh4! 50.Be2 Rh7! 51.Kf1?
This allows a beautiful finish. Computer engines give White survival chances after 51.Bh5!! Rxh5 52.Kf1.
51...Qxf4+!! 0-1
Exercise 15 - easy/medium White to move From a famous game Larsen-Petrosian, Santa Monica 1966. It 'feels' as if White's attack should be winning. Can you find the way 'The Great Dane' crushed 'Iron Tigran'? Show/Hide Solution Solution 15 Answer: It's nice if you found the beautiful queen sacrifice:
25.Qxg6!! Nf4
25...fxg6 26.Bxe6+ does not change anything.
26.Rxf4 fxg6 27.Be6+ Rf7 28.Rxf7 Kh8 29.Rg5
White has all the time in the world to mate Black, as Black's pieces are completely cut off.
29...b5 30.Rg3 1-0
Exercise 16 - easy/medium White to move This position is from one of the legendary Kasparov-Karpov Zaitsev battles. The defensive resource Karpov is banking on here is the pin on the white queen. Did Karpov miss something here? Try to find the attacking resource for the legendary 13th World Champion! Show/Hide Solution Solution 16 Answer: It's great if you found the following attacking idea for White:
36.Rg8+! Ke7
And now, a small pawn move destroys Black's coordination!
37.d6+! Ke6 38.Re8+ Kd5 39.Rxe5+ Nxe5 40.d7 Rb8 41.Nxf7
And Black resigned. Exercise 17 - advanced Black to move This position could have come from the K-K game from the previous example. White is a piece down, he might lose even another one, however Black's king has almost no defenders. Calculate the lines, assess the position! What is the objective evaluation? Show/Hide Solution Solution 17 Answer: It's excellent if you came to the conclusion that the position is equal, it's a draw by perpetual check, and you saw the following lines:
31...Rxb1+ 32.Bc1+
It's nice if you spotted that 32.Kh2 leads to a draw too after 32...Rh1+! 33.Kxh1 Nxf2+ 34.Kg1! Qxg3 and White has to force perpetual check with 35.Bg7+! Kxg7
36.Ne8+.
32...Kg7
There is no mate, so White, being too much material down, has to agree to a draw:
33.Ne8+ Kg8 34.Nf6+
Exercise 18 - advanced Black to move We are following the game R. Svane-McShane, Germany Bundesliga 2019/20. Luke McShane is under a terrible attack. However, he does have a hidden defensive resource! How can Black save the game? Show/Hide Solution Solution 18 Answer: It's excellent if you managed to find the following 'top-level' defence for Black here:
27...c4!
27...Qe8? was a losing mistake - see the games section.
28.g5
And now comes the point!
28...Qa5!
Black's queen is active and White's king is exposed - Black saves the game! White's best chance is
29.Qh7+
29.Bxd6 is equal after the easy moves 29...Qe1+ 30.Kg2 Qe4+ 31.Kf1 fxg5.
29...Kf7 30.Bxd6 Bxd6 31.Qh5+
Black still needs to play a few only moves now:
31...Ke6! 32.Re3+ Be5! 33.Qg4+
Or 33.f4 Qd2!.
33...f5 34.Qxc4+ Qd5 35.Qa6+ Qd6
And this way the game could have been saved. Exercise 19 - medium White to move A position from the game Vachier-Lagrave-Amin, France tt 2019. White has a strong attack which is in the 'execution phase'. Think of three candidate moves for White and see if one of your candidates is the move MVL played. Show/Hide Solution Solution 19 Answer: Congratulations if one of your candidate moves was the direct
34.g4!
and Black's position collapses in a few moves:
34...hxg4 35.Qh4 gxf3 36.Qxh6 Ne5 37.Nxf3 Ncd7 38.Ng5 Nf8 39.Nxf7! Qxf7
40.Rxf7 Kxf7
Black cannot build a fortress here.
41.Bd1! Re7 42.Bg4 1-0
Exercise 20 - advanced Black to move Assess the position and find the best continuation for Black. Show/Hide Solution Solution 20 Answer: It's excellent if you assessed the position as equal and found the only move for Black that does not lose:
24...Nxd4+!
The game went 24...Qf6? 25.Qd5+ (Black now loses decisive material) 25...Re6 (or
25...Rf7 26.Rxh7) 26.g5 (too many black pieces are hanging) 26...Nxd4+ 27.Kd1
and Black resigned.
25.Rxd4 Qg5!
Thus, this wild game could have petered out into a peaceful endgame. 25...Qf6? does not stop Qd5+ and loses to 26.Rd7.
26.Qd5+
26.Qh3 is not a winning attempt as White will only be in trouble after the simple
26...Re7.
26...Qxd5 27.cxd5 Bd6=
Or 27...fxe3=.
