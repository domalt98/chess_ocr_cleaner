SIMPLE CHESS
Michael Stean Simple C/less Is an introduction to chess strategy aimed primarily at those players for whom strategy in chess is an almost impenetrable mystery. By isolating the basic elements and illustrating them through a selection of master and grandmaster games. Simple Chess attempts to break down the mystique of chess strategy into plain, clear, easy-to understand ideas. The book assumes only a knowledge of chess terminology from the reader. Simple Clles.� Is not solely a lesson in chess fundamentrus, it also represents a style of chess playing which IS beconting increaSingly prevaient and suo::essful throughout the world. Almost all the games in the book are illustrative of this style which involves a slow-build-up, gradually accumulating small but permanent advantages, with the concept of attack being shelved for the later stages of the game. It is indeed the spread and success of this style of play that prompted the writing of thI

1. Introduction
Don't be deceived by the tille-chess is not a simple game-such a claim would be misleading to say the least-but that does not mean that we must bear the full brunt of its difficulty. When faced with any problem too large to cope with as a single entity. common sense tells us to break it down into smaller fragments of manageable proportions. For example, the arithmetical problem of dividing one number by another is not ooe that can in general be solved in one step, but primary school taught us to find the answer by a series of simple division processes (namely long division), So, how can we break down the 'problem' of playing chess? Give 0"'0 of the uninitiated a chessboard, a set of chessmen, a list of rules and a lot of time, and you may weI! observe the following process: the brighter of the two will quickly understand the idea of checkmate and win some games by 1. e4 2. Bc4 3. QhS 4. Q;\fl mate. When the less observant of our brethren learns how to defend his f7 square in time, the games will grow longer and it wilt gradually occur to the players that the side with more pieces will generally per se be able to force an eventual checkmate. This is the first important 'reduction' in the problem of playing chess-the numerically superior force will win. So now our two novices will no longer look to construct direct mates, these threats are too easy to parry, but will begin to Jearn the tricks of the trade for winning material (forks, skewers, pins, etc.), confident that this smaller objective is sufficient. Time passes and each player becomes sufficiently competent not to shed material without reason. Now they begin to realize the importance of developing quickly and harmoniously and of castling the king into safety. So what next! Where are their new objectives? How can the problem be further reduced? If each player is capable of quick development, castling and of not blundering any pieces away, what Is there to separate the two sides? This is the starting-point of Simple Chess. It tries to reduce the problem still further by recommending various positional goals which you can work towards, other things (i.e. material, development, security of king position) being equal. Just as our two fictitious friends discovered that the one with more pieces can expect to win if he avoids any mating traps, Simple Chess will provide him with some equally elementary objectives which if attained should eventually deCide the game in his favor. subject to the Strengthened provIso that he neither aHows any mating tricks, nor loses any material en route. Essentially, Simple Chc..' ss aims to give you some of the basiC ideas for forming a long-term campaign. It also shows you how to recognize and accumulate small, sometimes almost insignificant-looking advantages which may well have ![ltre or no short-term effect, but are permanent features of the pOSition. As the game progresses, the cumulative effect begins to make itself felt more and more, leading eventually to more tangible gains. This style of play is Simple and economical both In its conception and execution. Combinations and attacks are shelved for their proper time and place as the culmination of an overall strategy. Given the right kind of position it is not so difficult to overwhelm the opposition with an avalanche of sacrifices. The real problem is how to obtain such positions. This is the objective of Simple Chess. Undoubtedly the best way to improve your chess is by studying master and grandmaster games. For this reason I have used a selection of such games as a medium through which to put across the fundamental principles of simple chess. These games are mostly not of the type to capture the limelight of dless literature because they are too simple and unsensational, but for tlIis very reason they are suitable for showing off dearly the basic ideas I want to convey. As a preliminary to splitting the clements of simple chess into an array of recognizable objectives, as will occur in the ensuing chapters. I want to give you 2 something of the tlavor of what is to come in the form of three Introductory games containing most of the concepts and strategies to be elaborated later on. The first is a victory by ex-World Champion Mikhail Botvinnik over the Hungarian International Master Szilagyi in Amsterdam, 1966. One of the truly great masters of strategy. Botvinnik gives a typically powerful and very instructive display. We pick up the play in diagram 1 with BOlvinnik (White) to move: 8 7 6 4 3 2 1. a b c d e g h The position may at first sight seem quite good for Black. His piec£!s occupy good squares in the center, his king is very safe and he has a lead in d£!velopment having already connected his rooks on the back rank while White is a 10ng way fTOm doing so. However, positionally he has problems arising from the exchange of his Queen's Bishop for a Knight. In the long run he wlll find difficulty in defending his White squares. We shall see what this means in more tangible terms as th£! gam£! progresses.
12. b4
A space-gaining move. The center is fixed and White 3 does nOl want to advance 0]1 the Kingside for fear of exposing his own monarch, so the logical zone for expansion is on the Queenside. 12.
13. a 4
Bb6 RfdS Black dare not hit back with13 ..a5 because of 14. Ba3 foHowed by Nc4 or Nb3 with lots of dangerous possibilities on the a3-f8 diagonal.
14. Qc2 RacS
Black already finds himself lacking a good plan. A better idea has 14 ... NfS followed by Ne6 and as trying to get a grip on c5 Dr d4. Black's difficulties stem from the fact that he has no good outpost for his pieces. 15. Be2 In contrast Botvinnik's advance has given him a nice square on c4 which he can occupy with either a Knight or a Bishop. IS. csn Two question marks for a move which does not actually lose any material may seem a bit harsh, but I want to emphasize the point that before 15 ... c5 Black merely had problems, but now he is lost.
16. b5!
4 2. a b c d e 8 h Why Is Black lost? Material is equal and White hasn't gOt a piece beyond the second rate. The answer lies in the Pawns. White has two beautiful !\quares on c4 and d5, plus a mobile Pawn roller on the left flank, whereas Black's Pawns constrict his own pieces terribly, parocularly the Bishop. Botvinnlk now treats us to a vigorous exhibition of technical chess as he converts these advantages into a win. 16. 17. 18. 18. Nc' BgS! Ne8 N d 6 A surprise tactical shot, but its aims are positional. '6 The point of the combination. Black is forced to weaken yet another White square (e6) In the heart of his position. Refusal to fall in with White's plans is even more unpalatable: (i) 18 .. . QxgS 19. Nxd6 Rb8 20. Bc4

White's contra! of the poSition Is so great that he could inSCribe his initials on the board with his King if he wanted.

A perfect illustration of what is known as a White square strategy, something we will explore in more depth later on. For the moment, however, I merely want to draw your attention to the effortless simplicity with which Botvinnik established and drove home his advantage. With the possible exception of 18. BgS!, none of his moves could in any way be described as surprising or difficult to visualize, They were al! reany rather obvious. So why cannot everybody play Uke that? Well, they can providing they recognize and understand the importance of structure. The most important single feature of a chess position Is the activity of the pieces. This is absolutely fundamental in all phases of the game (opening, mtddlegame and especially endgame), a theme which I hope will become increasingly apparent as the book progresses. The primary constraint on piece's activity is 7 f g h the Pawn structure. Just as a building is constructed around a framework of iron girders, a chess game is built around an underlying Structure of pawns. The difference lies in the fact that the iron framework is fixed, whereas the chessplayer has a certain amount of flexibility with his Pawns. The job of the chessplayer must therefore be to use his skill to create a Pawn set-up which will allow his own pieces the optimum freedom and stability, while denying his oppOnent's similar scope. This is the problem of structure, which will be dealt with in some depth. 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 3. a b c d e g h To take an example, let us go back to the position of Diagram 2 and examine it from a structural point of view. Removing the pieces from the board, but leaving the pavms, we have Diagram 3. From this we see very slrong squares or outposts for his pieces on c4 and d5. They are strong because neither can be challenged by a Black Pawn. In contrast, Black has no outposts at all. So arithmetically �peaking White had a 2-0 lead in outposts, a very healthy state of affairs. Bearing this in mind, notice the vital role played by the White Pawn on c3 guarding Black's natural outpost on d4. If White were ever to play the pOSitionally 8 backwards. f abysmal c41 he would not only give Black his long awaited outpost, but would also �motber his O\\IJl c4 square, thus equalizing the outpoSt score to 1 �1 at a stroke. Moreover the damage would be Irreversible. Pawns cannot move back... "ards. If you inadvertently put a piece on a bad square, you can always retract it at the cost. of :;ome time (and face), but in the case of a Pawn you arc lumbered with it for the rest of the game. Think twice about Pawn moves, especially in the center. 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 4. a b c d e g h Returning to Diagram 3, is there any way for Black to Improve matters, structurally speaking? Certainly. If he could advance c5�c4, the world would suddenly be a much happier place for bim. Loo k at Diagram 4. Black now has three excellent squares c5, d3, and b3, while White has to be content with one (d5). So we see that White's c4 square is strategically the focal point of the position. Just as the outcome of a real battle may depend on controL of a high point or mountain dominating the surrounding terrain, a chess game can hinge around the struggle for control of one key square. In this case it is the square (4. Do you recall Botvinnik's 15th move Be2l It may not have seemed terribly significant at the time, but In fact shO\vs that he f had already fuUy recognized the strategic Importance of the <:4 square. Clever fellows these Russians] We now turn our attention to an even more striking demonstration of the power and importance of structure, this time given by the great master of defence Tigran Petrosian. The ninth game of his Candidates' Match with Lajos Portisch (Black) starled 1. Nf3 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. b3 Hg7 4. Bb2 e5 5, g3 d6 6. Bg2 e5 7. O-O Ne6 8, Nc3 O-O 9. d3 NhS 10. Nd2 Bg4 11. a3 Bh6 reaching the position of Diagram 5, 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 s. a b c d e g h At a glance the Black p i eces may seem to be menacingly poised for a Kingside attack. On the other hand a quick look at the Pawn stnlCture reveals that White has an excellent outpost on d5, but how does that help? It certainly has no immediate value, as 12. NdS Nd4! 13. Bxd4 exd4 would allow Black to develop a lot of pressure on the e.-file. However, the ciS square is there to stay and if it cannot be profitably utilized at present, it is nevertheless a good investment for the future. With this in mind Petrosian chose.
12. b4!
The classical way to exploit a structural advantage in the center is with a thrust on the Oank, but here accurate calculation is also required. In the event of 12 ... cxb4 13. axb4 Nxb4 White plays 14. Ba3! (but not 14. Exb7 Nxd3!) with three possibilities: (i) 14 ... Nxd3? 15. h3 now wins a piece. Oil 14 ... Nc6 15. N(d2) e4 winning the d pawn. (iii) 14 ... aS IS. RbI regaining the Pawn with advan- tage as IS ... Nxd3? stlll fails to 16. h3. One might reasonably ask if it was not similar to drive away Black's Bishop with 12. 113 before playing b4 so as to avoid all the above complications based on the pin on White's e Pawn. The answer is that White does not want to make any Pawn move in front of his own King until it is abso/lJrely necessary, as it merely provides Black with a ready-made target to attack. For instance, 12. h3 Bd7 ] 3. b4 fs and .. .f4 could weU be dangerous for White.
12. N d 4
Black has some very dangerous threats. Not only is .. 6xdl and 14 ... Nb3 winning the exchange in the cards, but the Tal-like sacrifice 13 ... Nf4! 14 gxf4 Bxf4 followed by Qh4 is also in the air.
13. h3!
A sense of timing is the key to good defensive play. Here Petrosian accepts the weakening of his Kingside Pawns as he realizes that he can thereby completely repulse the attack. 13.
14. e3
Be6 cxb4 An anti-positional capture, but he has no alternative. After 14 ... Nc6 15. bxc5 dxcS 16. Nb3 Qe7 17. Na4 he simply loses a Pawn for nothing. 1 1
15. axb4 Nc6

17. Bxh3
18. Bxa8 Bxfl 18 ... Qxa8 19. Qf3 is very much the same as the game.
19. Kxfl QxaS
20. Qf3!
A very strong move, if an equally obvious one. After 20 .. Qxf3 21. Nxf3 not only is Black structurally quite lost, but he has not even enough time to defend his a Pawn in view of the threatened g4 and gS winning a piece.
20. Qb8
This leads to the immediate and rather quaint loss of a piece, but there is nothing better to recommend. If you arc wondering why Black is so abjectly lost. compare the Pawn structures.

The double threat of <":('7 and Qh4! is dedsive. After the further mows 22 ... N{g7)f 5 23. gxfS Nxf5 24. e 4 Ng7 25. Ke1 NbS 26. Qh4 f5 27. Nd5 Black resigned. A resoundingly deciSive game to win again a World Championship contender, but Petrosian didn't have to work all that hard. His Pawns in their own quiet way did all the work for him. In both of the preceding games, Black's structural deficiency has taken the form of weak squares rather than the Pawns themselves being weak. In most cases these two effects (weak squares, weak Pawns) go hand in hand, as we shall see, For the moment, here is a game in which White uses the presence of weak Pawns In the enemy camp to tie dowrl the Black pieces and so launch a mating attack, despite the absence of QJ..ieens.

8 7 6 5 4 3 2 6. a b c d e g h The pOSition is tense. Black's Pawn on eS is weak, but that is his only weakness. The doubled c Pawns are not weak, not yet at a ny rate.

The point. White recaptures control of the vital c4 square: by force, for if nOw 17... c4 then simply 18, Rddl and the Pawn on c4 cannot be held,

19. Rxa4
Black's tortuous maneuvers (the Rook has moved to enable the Knight to defend the Bishop which defends his Pawns!) have maintained material equality, but left his King out in the cold. A typical example of the necessity to defend weaknesses drawing the defending forces out of position. 19. Kb7 What else?

24. dS
2S. exd S Resigns. The moral behind this trilogy of games should be clear: Look after your Pawns and your pieces will look after themselves. To 'look after' one's Pawns is not the most difficult thing in the world, and the next few chapters illustrate how this can be done and how the pieces can be made to cooperate with their Pawns.
2. Outposts
We all like to attack. There is a streak of sadism running through every chcssplayer that helps him to sit back contentedly sipping a cup of tea while his opponent, head in hands, tries frantically to averl mate in three. But where do attacks come from? The mere action of pushing one or nvo pieces in the general direction of the enemy King does not constitute an attack. In general a successful attack can only be launched from a position of strength in the center of the board. This 'position of Hrength' can take various forms, the simplest being an outpost. As the name suggestS, an outpost is a square at the forefront of your position which you can readily Support and from where yOll can control or contest squares in the heart of the enemy camp. To be useful an outpost must be firmly under control and so should Ideally be protected by a Pawn. Conversely your opponent should not be given the opportunity to deny you access to your outpost, so in particular it must be immune to attack by enemy pawns. This last condition is far and away the most important and can indeed almost be taken as the defining property of an outpost.
- M
So as not to blur the issue with too many words let us look at some example� of outposts purely in term.<; of Pawn structure. In Diagram 7, there are plenty to be seen. White, from a Structural pOint of view, has outposts on dS, b6, b4, g4. One might also regard c4 and a4 as outposts, for although they are not supported by Pawns, they certainly are immune from attack by them. Black has supported outposts on f4, g3, and unsuppOrted ones on gS and hS. You may have noticed that all of White's outposts are on the Qpeenside, Black's on the Kingside, so with such a Pawn structure one \Nould normally expect to see White attacking on the left flank, and Black on the right. This is all very theoretical and hypothetical, far from the stark realism of practice. For example, one rarely encounters the plethora of outposts seen in Diagram 7. You often have to be satisfied with one, or less! 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 7. b c d e g h Tal-Bronstein, 26th Soviet Championship, Tiflis 1959

8 7 6 ; 4 3 2 8. a b c d e g 11 A quick look at the Pawn structure reveals that White has one outpost (on d5), Black has none.

17. NgS c41

Indeed, he only has to decentralize one piece (20 ... Na5) and the White Knight jumped down his throat. We have just seen how an attack can spring from a central outpost. More obviously. an outpost in the vldnity of the enemy King is an excellent platform from which an offenSive can be launched. Benko·Najdorf, Los Angeles 1963

Nxe7+ Resigns On account of 23 ... Q]{c7 24. QaS+. We have so far seen iIluSlrations of how to set up, secure and exploit outposts, but no due has been given as how to play against an outpost. The most usual way to counter an enemy outpost Is to cover it with as many pic(:es as possible so that when he occupies it with a piece, you can capture enough times [0 force him eventually to recapture with a Pawn. 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 20. a b c d c g h For example, in Diagram 20, White has an outpost on f eS, but NeS can always be met by NxeS and after recapturing with the Pawn, his OUtpost is gone. Clearly he needs to bring another minor piece to bear on eS, so White to move would play 1. BgS and fonow it up with Bh4 and Bg3. If on the other hand Black is on the move, he would seek to prevent this. L.h6 is the obvious way, but a more active solution is preferable-namely 1...Qe8 (so as to meet 2. BgS with 2 ...QhS! threatening Rxf3) or 1...Qb6. Either move gives Black a fine position. 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 21. a b c d e g h If you are unabJe to cover your opponent's outpost, then extremely active harassing tactics are needed. Diagram 2 1 shows a marked structural resemblance to Diagram 19, but the position features a vital difference--the White Knight has not yet reached dS. Indeed it is at least four moves away. This gives Black some breathing space, which he must make good use of. After the Knight reaches dS he is lost. The diagrammed position occurred in the game Unzicker-Fischer, Varna 1962.

The pieces must be able to coordinate with the Pawn structure. After all, what use is a body without a soul? 3 . Weak Pawns In the previous chapter we looked at Pawn structure from the point ofvlew of outposts and how an outpost acts as a pivot, about which the pieces can swing Into action. Without such an outpost as foundation, pieces tend to Jack the stability necessary for a successful assault and are liable to be driven back in confusion. It Is sheer folly to try to attack directly a well coordinated and deve.loped position. Many players underestimate the defensive resources Inherent in such positions and will in game after game bash Uleir heads against a brick wall instead of using their heads to first weaken the cement. The point they repeatedly fail to appreciate is that a very definite superiority In force is needed to ensure that an attack will be successful. This superiority can take either one of two forms: (i) Better development. This Is simply a c ..se of superiority In numbers. the aggressor being able to feed more pieces into the attack than the defender has avallable to fight them off. (Ii) Better coordination. This is a much more subtle form of advantage which one must "'ark hard to build up. The idea Is to disarm the defense by first tying its pieces down to the defense of certain point�, so that when the storm does break they have vel)' IitUe scope or opportunity to react. Here we concern ourselves primarily with the second condition. Outposts provide the necessary stability for the attacker, but something must also be done to destroy the defender's coordination. This is where the second aspect of Pawn structure, weak Pa\\IJ1s, comes in. If the defending forces can be reduced to the menial task of protecting Pawns, they wilt not he able to offer much opposition to a fuB-scale offensive. So what exactly is a weak Pawn and how is it recognizable? The answer is both Simple and logical. A weak Pawn is one which cannot be protected by another P"cl.wn and so requires support from its own pieces. Note that the criterion is the ability LO be protected by another Pawn, not the existence of such protection. Take the example of two adjacent Pawns on, say, d4 and e4. Neither protects the other but each has the ability to be guarded by the other, by advancing. We must therefore say that the weakness or strength of two adjacent Pawns depends on whether or not they are able to advance if the necessity arises. 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 22.

Diagram 22 gives us an example of adjacent Pawns (d6, c6) which are very definitely weak, because neither can move, d5 is never feasible, as il leaves the e Pawn in the soup after the reply exd5 (note for this purpose the power of the White Rook on ell, while c5 leaves Black riddled with holes. The continuation of the game Hecht-Forintos illustrates well the combination of outpost play (fS) and the exploitation of weak Pawns. 1 . Bg5 A simple developing move which exerts great pressure on the Black Pawns. White bas many threats to win a Pawn, including the spectacular 2. NxeSJ 1 .

Rd Turning the focus of attention to the c Pawn (he threatens to win it by capturing twice on (7), while preserving the harmony of the White position. 2 . Rac8 3 . Rc3! A multipurpose move illustrating clearly the maleffects of weak Pawns. White creates options to double on the c file (with Qj::2). double on the d file (Rd3) or possibly transfer the Rook to g3 at some later date. Black has no opportunity to reciprocate, but must on every move be prepared to meet each contingency. We see a definite rift between the mobility of the two armies opening up. When the gap becomes wide enough White will be able to bludgeon his way through the Black position without encountering much resistance. 3 . Bxg5 4 . NxgS Nf4 5 . g 3 B h 5 I f 5 ...Ne6, 6 .

6. Qd2 Ne6
7 , Nxe6 Qxe6 B . QgS Suddenly it's all over. There are three different threats (<n:g7 mate, QxhS Ne7+) and no defense to all of them. The speed of capitulation should make it abundantly clear that pieces tied to the defense of weak Pawns are often unable to defend themselves. The most common form of Pawn weakness encountered in practical play is the isolated Pawn-one which has lost its neighbors and stands alone in face of the enemy. Such a Pawn has two basic deficiencies: firstly it requires defense, and secondly the squares immediately in front of it make ideal outposts for the other player. To see in more tangible terms what this means, let us look at a famous game Fischer won on his road to the World Championship against an ex-World Champion Tigran Petrosian. 1 . 2 . 3 . 4 .

He must use the weakness of the two isolated Pawns to tie down the Black pieces while maximizing the activity of his O\vn.
16. BeS
One of the secrets of endgame play is to realize which pieces to exchange, which to retain. Here White wants to trade off the Black·squared Bishops for two reasons: (i) As the weak Pawns stand on White squares, the Black-squared Bishop is the only piece which cannot be tied down to their defense. (ii) While wants to use the c5 square as an outpost fOf his Knight.

18. b4!
The next logical step in the chain. Having just traded the 'right' pair of Bishops, he does not want the Black Pawns to run away onto Black squares, for in that case he will have traded the wrong Bishops! NovI' White can always meet ...as with bs and the massive passed Pawn must prove decisive. This process of fixing weaknesses on squares where they are most readily assailable si particularly common and should always be horne in mind when playing against weak Pawns. It is also worth noting that b4 establishes the outpost on cs. Whether you approach the position from the point of view of outposts or weaknesses, the move 18. b4! cries out to be played. 1 8 . Kf8 In endgames the King is a very powerful piece and should be used as such. The immediate value of this move Is to unpin the Bishop, but in the longer term Black would like to bring his King to d6 from where it would probably cement his position together.
19. NcS B c 8
2 0 . f 3 White also needs t o use his King. Despite the fact that each of his pieces is more actively placed than its opposite number there si no immediate way to break through, so the King must be used to increase the pressure. Mistaken would be 20. Rxe7 Kxe7 21. Rel+ Kd6 when Black can probably hold the position. It is important not to allow the Black King across the e file. Once on the Queenside it can to some extent release the pieces from their task of defending Pawns for more active service. 2 0 . 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 25. a b c d e g h Rea? A very curious move, but its motivation is worth closer study. There are no points in the White position to coumer attack, so Black must seek some method of 'improving' his own position. The obvious try is to bring the King to d6, but the only available route Ke8, Kd8, Kc7, Kd6 is both long and hazardous. The other possibility is to transfer the Bishop to a more active defensive post. At the moment the Bishop effectively defends the a Pawn, but plays no further part in the game, other than interfering with the Rooks' coordination and generally getting in the way. It could fulfill its duties much more effidently from bS, but the problem is how [0 get there. The normal try would be ZO. .. Nd7 21.

A truly classic game, one worth continual restudy. It shows with perfect simplicity all the steps necessary to transform a superior Pawn structure into a win. The one underlying theme running through the whole game is the way the Black pieces are systematically deprived of all mobility. f 8 7 6 5 4 1. 2 27. a b c d e g h Next we look a t doubled Pawns, a subject littered with common misconceptions. Contrary to popular belief, doubled Pa wns are not invariably weak but in many cases arc definitely advantageous. Naturally doubled isolated Pawns are to be avoided, hut there is no reason to fear having doubled Pawns when no isolation of Pawns occurs. For example, in the following line of the Vienna Opening 1. c4 eS 2. Nc3 Nf6 3. 13c4 Ne6 4. d3 Bb4 S. Nf3 d6 6. O-O Bxc3 7. hxc3 NaS 8. Bb3 Nxb3 9. axb3 O-O 10. c4 (Diagram 27), the only effect of the doubled Pawns is to give White a small but unquestionable advantage. Why? Basically because White has more central Pawns than his opponent (he leads by two c Pawns to one), In the opening and middlegame center Pawns are more valuable than flank Pawns. Moreover the White Pawns provide a very effective barrier a g a inst the enemy Bishop without any way impeding lheir own Bishop. Above all there is no question of White having any weak Pawns-they all protect each other, exc<''Pt for the 'base' at c2 which is completely unassailable. Tllere is of course very little wrong with the Black position either, but the Danish Grandmaster Bent Larsen has been able to turn White'S slender adva ntage into a win. It requires infinite patience and perfect technique, but it is possible. The pros and cons of doubled Pawns may be thought of in tenns of a military line along which forces are evenly distribut.ed. One can reinforce a certain part of the line only at the cost of weakening another. Naturally the value of the policy depend.� on how serious the weakening effect is. To translate this notion into chess terms consider the Pawn complex e3, B, f2, h2. The Pawn triplet on e3. f3, f2, is by itself quite strong as it controls a lot of central squares without exhibiting much to attack. The weakness lies with the isolated h Pawn and the squares in front of it. Returning to the context of our analogy we can say that the center has been strengthened at the cost of weakening the flank. If the latter effect lurns out to be inconsequential then the doubling of the Pawns must be reckoned to be a good thing. Axon Nimzowitsch was maybe one of the first to have a deep understanding of doubled Pawns. A great chess thinker and experimentalist, he pioneered what is nowadays generally considered to be the 'perfect' defense to 1. d4, namely 1. . .Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 Bb4-the Nimzo-Indian. Black's basic strategy is to take the Knight at the right moment, doubling White's c Pawns and then try to prove that they are weak. Naturally this idea has received many ramifications over the years, but it can still be made to work even at the highest levels. 1 . 2 . 3 . 4.

The White BishOps are badly hemmed in by their own Pawns and without prospect of ever breaking Qut. We have here a new source of 'weakness'. White's Pawns are bad not so much because they require defense, but simply because they get in the way.

R d 1 Bxf31 A fine move that tells us much about doubled Pawns. Black is not doubling White's f Pawns in order to attack them, but to create an outpost for his Knight on d4. The quartet of Pawns on fl, £3, g3, h2 in itself forms a very strong Pawn complex, but the metamorphosis of White's e Pawn into an f Pawn means that he can no longer control his d4 square. We can see exactly the same idea in a game Karpov-Browne, San Antonio 1972, which opened 1. c4 cS 2. b31? Nf6 3, BbZ g6?!

But this is a serious mistake. Admittedly 14. dS Nd4 is good for Black because of his powerful Knight, but it at least does not offer him any obviolls point of attack. The text move however opens the b file and so leaves White with a backward b Pawn open to allack along the file.

In recent tlme.s there has been a trend to go to almost any 1enb>ths in order to weaken enemy Pawns. especially to inflict doubled isolated Pawns. The first victim of this trend was the previously much revered fianchettoed g2 or g7 Bishop. For example: 1. c4 g6 2. Nc3 Bg7 3. Nf3 cS 4. d4 cxd4 S. Nxd4 Nc6 6. Ne2 Bxc3+!

4. Open Files
'Put your Rooks on open files' is a piece of advice every beginner receives, and it very sound piece of advice it i�. But like allpieces of sound advice, it can prove to be inadequate, or worse. 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 34. a b c d e g h Look at Diagram 34. An innocent-looking position, but if Black (to move) dutifully seizes the only open file with

6. Rxdl and the White Rook reaches the seventh rank
(6 ...Re7?? 7. Rd8+ Kh7 8. Bd6 wins the Rook!). (ii) 2 ... b6 (to prevent the Bishop driving Black off the d file) 3. as! c 5 (forced) 4. axb6 axb6 5 . Ra7 followed by Rhal with a winning position, e.g. 5 ... Ra8 6. Rhal Rxa7
7. Rxa7 ReG 8. Rb7 and Kb3-c4-b5 mopping up the
Queenside Pawns. Why the storm from a clear sky? Because files do not always operate on the first come, first served system. If you look back at variation (I) you will see that Black ran into trouble on the d file, despite having first option on it. So where did he go wrong? Firstly, he failed to appreciate the disparity in strength between the Bishops. The White Bishop was able in variation (i) to drive the Black Rooks off the d file singlehandedly, and in variation (ii) enabled White to open the a file for his own Rooks. In both cases the Black Bishop was a spectator. And secondly, Black had no reason to occupy the d file anyway. Occupation of an open file is of no value unless there is a chance of penetration. Here the White King prevents any possible insurgence on the d file. In particular the entry square on the seventh rank, invariably the most important, is also guarded by lhe White Bishop, making the d tile an entirely prospectless avenue for Black. If the Black King were on, say, e6 rather lhan g8, the d file would be just as worthless for White. Returning to the diagram, the correct treatment by Black is 1 ... Kh71, preparing to trade off White's dangerous Bishop, and after 2 . Rdl (threatening of course Rd7) 2 ... Red8 (not 2...RadS? 3. Be3 gaining a tempo by the attack on the a Pawn) 3 . Be3 Bh6!, because the Pawn-grabbing attempt 4. RxdS RxdS 5. Bxa7 allows Black in on the seventh rank (S ... Rd2+). Better is 4. BcS threatening to seize control of the file with Be7, but Black can defend with 4 ... B g 5 to be followed by bringing his King across to e6. (However, after 5. g3 [threatening 6. h4J 5 .. .h4 [forced] 6. Bd6! will either win the e Pawn or allow White to establish a Rook on the 7th rank after 6 ...Bf6 7. Bc7, when Black is still in serious difficulties. Also, fi 6 ... Re8 7. HO! He?? S. HdB wins.-editor) It must be stressed that open files only have value as a means of feeding Rooks (or possible Queens) into the enemy position, so that a file has no value unless there is somewhere along it an entry point, i.e. an advanced point on whtch a Rook can safely land. The ideal entry point is on the seventh rank or the second rank (i.e. d7 or d2 on the d file, etc.). Every Rook secretly dreams of landing on the seventh or second ranks, making a 90-degrce right (or left) turn and eating its way through the enemy lines. There is something magical about the number seven for a While Rook. Alternat.ively, points of entry on the eighth, Sixth, or even fifth rank can be just as effective. But there must be one, otherwise the file is u.<>eless. In this respect the King can play an important role. In the endgame, there is no piece better equipped to defend entry points than the King. For example, a King on e2 simultaneously covers three entry squares on the d file (dl, d2 and d3), a feat which no other piece (apart from the Queen of course) can perform. This makes the location of the oPPosing King a vital fanor in assessing the value of an open file in the endgame. The basic rule is the further from the King, the better. Returning to our example, we can see that the d me was not a useful commodity for Black because of the proximity of t.he White King, yet the very same file was potentially lethal in White's hands as the Black King was far away. We can see this principle operating in the following vaIiation of the Sicilian Defense, the so-called Maroczy Bind: 1 . e4 cS 2 . Nf3 Ne6 3 . d4 exd4 4. Nxd4 g6 S . c4 Nf6 6. Ne3 Nxd4 7. Qxd4 d6 8 .

Winning the file and probably the game as well. Although this does not exhaust Black's defensive possibilities, it does show that he has problems to solve. These problems arise primarily out of his niability to contest White's h3-c8 diagonal and the consequent difficulty in holding on to the c file. The minor pieces play a major role in determining who controls open files. The side with the more active minor pieces can generally count on gaining access to any files that may open up. This is basically what happened in our previous examples. Naturally, outposts too have their part to play. This is better illustrated by Diagram 37 than by words alone. 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 37. a b c d e g h The main features of the position a.re an open c me and a White outpost on b6.

The pieces rely heavily all each other's help and cooperation, so jf one does not pull its weight it lets the whole side down. If you look back you w:illsee that in no example so far has one side lost out on a file because his Rooks were badly placed. In each case the team has been dragged down by the inability of some Bishop or Knight to match its opposite number. There Is an old chess maxim: 'If one piece is bad, the whole position Is bad: How true. Maybe this will explain why there is so much talk of Bishops, Knights and Kings (alas no cabbages!) in a chapter on open files. 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 38.

One of the dangers of falling behind in development in the opening is that the enemy Rooks will be first on the scene and will take possession of the open files before your own can be scrambled into action. Rooks are notoriously difficult to bring into play quickly, so any loss of time incurred early on is liable to postpone their development still further. Many games have been won or lost because of this, but few display this motif with subtlety of the following encounter. White: U. Andersson, Black: R. Knaak Capablanca Memorial Tournament, 1974

When the checks run out White's mating threats (Rb8 and BishOp moves) are unstoppable. f 5 . Half-open files: the minority attack The open file is a double·edgcd wcapon. Although a way to feed the major pieces into the heart of the opponent's position, there is always the danger of it being seized and used to reciprocal effect by the enemy. In short, it is a two way road for Rooks. The chcssplayer, not being an unselfish advocate of equality of opportunity, naturally prefers a ooe way system. The half-open file is precisely this. We do not have to go very far (three moves to be exact) to find an example of one: 1. d4 d5 2. c4 ('6 3. cxdS cxdS. 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 43. a b c d c g h White has the half-open c file, Black the half-open e file. $0 whal does this mean? Cannot Black always erect a granite wall on the c file by c6 and White do Similarly on lhe e file by c3? Yes of course, but the point is that the Black Pawn chain b7, c6, dS can by challenged by White with b4 and bS. When b5 comes, there is no way Black can avoid being left with a weak Pawn. If he captures away from (6, the d Pawn is left isolated, while allowi.ng an exchange on c6 will leave the c Pawn backward. These are the simple mechanics of the minOrity attack. It is no more nor less than a method of weakening an otherwise sound Pawn set-up by advancing Pawns at it. The process is quite long and slow, the payoff at the end rc\ativeJy small (one weak Pawn to aim at, two maybe if you are lucky), but its value is undeniable. Moreover, it cannot easily rebound on you. An open file can change hands, a half-open file cannot. Indeed it cannot even be challenged. Imagine the contortions Black would have to go through to oppose Rooks on the c me in front of his Pa .... n.s in a position akin to that of Diagram 43. Out of the question. The minority attack has a certain inevitability about it. Though cumbersome, once the mighty wheels have been set in motion, the oppOSition has no way to apply the brakes. So much for extolling the virtues of half-open files, but going to Diagram 43 we see that Black has the e file. Surely, he too can launch a minority attack in due course? Not so easy. A minority attack on the e file would involve advancing his f and g Pawns. But where is he to put his King? Certainly not on [he Queenside in the path of White's attack. On the other hand it is not lhe height of expediency to castle Kingside and then send your Kingside Pawns scampering off into the distance to create just one weak Pav·m in the enemy camp. The final reward is simply not worth the risk. In general one cannot afford to mount a minority attack in front of a castled King. These attacks only usually work on the other side of the board. Let us look at a couple of examples of play from Diagram 43 to see how the minority attacks work out in practice. 1 . d4 d5 2. c4 e6 3. cxd5 exd5 4, Nc3 Nf6 5. Bg5 Be7

2 , b c d e g h This is a standard position in the so-called (for obvious reasons) Exchange Variation of the Queen's Gambit. White's method of development is both simple and economical, and with his last move he prepares to set the minority attack in motion, by b4. Black's method of play has been a little more contorted (ReB, NfB), the reason being that not having a worthwhile minority attack of his own, he wants to channel as many pieces as possible over to the Kingside in order to create some diversionary threats there. OUf first example, Van den Berg-Kramer 1950, proceeded: 1 1 . g 6 So as to play Ne6 without losing a Pawn to Bxf6. 1 2 . b 4 a 6 1 3 . a4 Ne6 1 4 . Bh4 No need to rush things with 14.

If Black is unable to throw any tactical spanners in the works, lhe well-oiled, mechanical minority attack will generally swallow up a Pawn sooner or later. Our second example shows how to create counterplay against the minority attack. Resuming from the pOSition of Diagram 44:

White must now proceed with caution. On 17. Nd2!, there comes 17 ... Nxd2 18. Qxd2 Nh4!. The powerful threats 19 ...Bh3! and 19 ...8f3! leave White at a loss for a reasonable reply, e.g. 19. f3 Q,.:e3+! 20. Qxe3 Rxe3 21. fxg4 Rxd3. Even here, however, White can extract something from the position by judicious play, i.e. 17. Bxe4! dxe4 18. Nd2 HfS 19. bxc6 bxc6 20. Ne2 with threats of Q;>;:c6 or Ng3. The two Knights do a good job here, hopping in and out of the weak squares created by White's Q!Jeenside advance. The minority attack is not purely geared to producing v.-eak Pawns, but Creates OUtposts as ",-ell (c5 In thiS case). Given that a minority attack runs more smoothly away from the central files (we saw In our previous examples that White could operate a minority attack with some effect on the c file, whereas Black found It difflcult to get going on the e file). and the startling criterion that a Pawn minority Is needed for a minority attack, it is not djfficult to appreciate that the best place to acquire a Pawn majority Is in the center. A surplus of Pawns in the middle necessarily means a defiCit somewhere else (assuming of course both sides do have equal Pawns). Remember the old rule 'always capture towards the center' applying to a choice of Pawn captures. The advantage of the central Pawn majority is the raison d'etre for this piece of advice. The hidden implication is: accumulate Pav.ns in the center and you can start minority attackS on the flank.o;. Take the following variation of the English Opening:
1. c4 Nf6 2. Nc 3 dS 3. cxdS NxdS 4. g3 g6 S. Bg2 Nxc3
6 . bxc3 Bg7. 46. 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 a b c d e g h By recapturing the Knight 'towards the center' (I.e. with the b Pawn ralher than the d Pawn), White has given himself an extra central Pawn. The offshoot of this Is a half-open b file which can later on in the game be used for a minority attack. To this end he does well to adopt a solid but purely passive Pawn set-up in the center (say Pawns on e2, d3, c4) so as to be able to direct a1l his fire-power to the left flank later on. Diagram 47 shows the type of position that might occur later on after some exchanges. White is ready to launch his minority attack. 47. 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 a b , d e 1 . a 4 06 Black wants to hold his QueenSide together by Nd7 without allowing a While Knight to jump Into dS. 2 . a 5 Nd7 Taking the a Pawn would split up Black's Pawns too much, e.g. 2... hxaS? 3.

So what part, if any, does the central Pawn majority play in the minority attack? A considerable part. lbe plan of seeping into the Black position via the Queenside is essentially slow and nonforcing. It only succeeds because Black has no point to counterattack, and this in turn is due to the impervious White center. Minority attacks must he built on the foundation of a firm central position. The victory may be won on the flank, but ultimately it is created in the center. Minority attacks derive from the Pawn :;tructure, Pawn structures derive from the opening. Go back to the eras of Capablanca and Alekhine and you will see Queen's Gambits, hoards of them, with hoards of minority attack::; descending from them. Nowadays* the Sicilian Defense is all the rage. Sicilians here, Sicilians there, Sicilians absolutely everywhere. Why this saturation with Sicilians? Does the Mafia's influence really extend this far? The answer lies in the minority attack. The whole idea of the Sicilian is for Black to trade his c Pawn for the d Pawn. White almost invariably obliges: 1. e4 cS 2. Nf3 Nc6 (or d6 or e6 or g6) 3. d4 cxd4, when Black immediately arrives at a minority attack Pawn structure. Half-open c file, extra central Pawn, 2-3 minority on the Queenside; these are all the necessary ingredients. Sounds infallible, so where's the snag? Why doesn't Black win every game? The problem is Df course that White has a lead in development in the early stages, which may prove difficult tD survive. Black's prospects lie later in the game when the winds of White's initiative have blDWn themselves out. White: L. Vogt, Black; U. Andersson Havana 1975

Rxf4 and Black soon won. The Pawn structure, or rather distribution in this endgame, is well worth remembering. Black had a 4-3 majOrity on the King side (e, f, g, h Pawns, VS. f, g, h Pawns) and White a 3-2 surplus on the Q!leenside (c, b, a Pawns vs. b and a Pawns). This distribution is fundamentally favorable for Black, firstly because of his first extra central Pawn (which in the game provided him with a powerful outpost on dS for his Knight), and secondly because of the Q!leenside minority attack. There is also a third advantage not apparent from our last game: four Pawns protect a King better than three. How many times have you read that Black's classical freeing move in the Sicilian is ...dS without understanding why? If Black can swap his d Pawn for White's e Pawn he reaches the 4-3 vs. 2-3 distribution advertised above. Of course, if White can meet ... dS with e5, it's a ditlerent story . .

The one aspect of the half-open file not properly covered to date is the outpost on the half-open file. This if> best explained by an example. 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 5 3 . a b c d e 9 h Diagram S3 shows another typical Sicilian Pawn structure. Black has the half-open c file, White the d file. Each has an associated outpost, White on dS, Black on c4. Outpost is something of a misnomer here, for as you may remember an outpost was originally defined as a square that could not be challenged by an enemy Pawn. Here Black can play e6 and White b3 chal1enging the respective outposts, but only at a cost. b3 weakens the c3 square and so makes the c Pawn more difficult to defend. Correspondingly, e6 weakens the Black d Pawn, so these moves can only be made in exceptional circumstances. The squares dS and c4 are therefore effectively outposts, if not technically so. These considerations explain a couple of points about the Sicilian Defense that may have been puzzling you: (i) Why does Black so often develop his f8 Bishop passively with e6 and Be7 when he can give it a beautiful .... . . diagonal by g6 and Bg71 Because e6 and Be7 deprive White of hsi dS outpOSt without leaving the d Pawn tooweak. After g6 and Bb7 Black can rarely consider e6 as well. (Ii) Why Is the Maroczy Bind (Pawns on e4 and (4) considered so effective for White against the Sicilian? Because with a White Pawn on c4 Black can have no outpost there. and Black can generate very little play on the c file. Strategical problems are born in the opening, which Is why it is so important to undersrand the op@nlngs you play. Hopefully tills chapter has given you some insight Into the workings of the SIcilian Defense and related openings as well as the minority attack. -,'. - 6 . Black squares and White squares Pawns are quite happy to defend pieces (outposts), yet pieces do not enjoy being tied to the defense of Pawns (weak Pawns). Bear these simple principles in mind and you are well on the way to mastering one of the fundamental problems of chess-cooperatiOn between pieces and Pawns. This harmony between workers and management so to speak is not solely the responsibility of the shop noor. There is no such thing as the 'perfect Pawn formation, because different pieces react in dfiferent ways to the same Pawn skeleton. One of the arts of chess strategy is to recognize which of your pieces fit in well with the Pawn structure, and to exchange off the ones that do not. In this context we are referring primarily to minor pieces (i,e. Bishops and Knights). Recognition of pieces which do or do not fit in welt with the Pawn structure centers mainly around the concept of ' good' and 'bad' Bishops. If most of your central Pawns become blocked on Black squares, say, the future for your Black-squared Bishop will be very limited. The White-squared Bishop on the other hand willbe completely unimpaired by its Pawns. Moreover, Pawns on Black :;quares do not protect White squares, so the Bishop is also needed to help cover the 'gaps'. Knights are less likely to be brought up before the Race Relations Board for color consciousness. They are quite happy to hop from Black squares to White and back again. 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 54. <1. b e d e 8 h Diagram 54 is a typical case of good Bishop vs. bad Bishop.

Many people reason 'If I put my Pawns on the same colored squares as my Bishop, I can defend them there'. If you commit hara-kiri instead, you won't have to defend them at all. The tWO solutions are roughly equivalent, give or take the problem of cleaning the blood off the board. The real fallacy In the argument is that jf you put all your Pawns on squares of the same color, say Black, there is no defense against enemy penetration on the White squares. Look at Diagram 55. 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 55. a b c d e g h There is only very scanty material left on the board and Black has only one Pawn to keep protected.

This is what .... -e are talking about when we saw things like ' ...and Black is weak on the White squares.' We mean there is a danger that a King (in the endgame) of a Queen (in the late middlegame) will be able to penetrate Into the position. Using bridge parlance, he has a duplication of honors. His Pawns cover Black squares, his Bishop does the same, so that after suitable exchanges there will be little more than overworked King to guard the other thirty-two. Naturally the less material on the board, the dearer the bad Bishop syndrome. This is why we started the section with two examples of pure Bishop endgames. Wilh Rooks un as well however the overall strategy is much the same. 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 56. a b c d c g h Diagram 56 is an endgame (Tarrasch-Teichmann, San Sebastian, 1912) which allexponents of the French Defense should try to avoid. Black has a bad Bishop and weak Black squares. The execution runs as follows: weakness 1 . g 4 The key to the White position is his King's outpost on d4. Because Black has no minor piece able to operate on Black squares, he cannot usurp the White monarch from its throne and moreover must keep a Rook permanently stationed on the c file to prevent his majesty from walking in. You may remember that the ' ... t·ealmess' of weak Pawns was that pieces could be tied down to their defense. Similarly the 'weakness' of weak squares is that defending pieces must keep them permanently covered to prevent infiltration. To exploit this constraint on the mobility of the Black Rooks, White must bring his own into the game. This he docs by a general advance on the Kingside which will eventually lead to the opening of some lines there. He chooses the extreme right flank for this action to stretch the defense as much as possible. In endgames you should try to introduce 'width' into your play, i.e. create trouble on two widely-spaced fronts. 1 . 2 . h 4 Be8 g6 Trying to keep the Kingside closed.

The most powerful piece in any endgame i:; the King, and the White square/mack square strategy is aimed to carve out a mute into the enemy camp for it. You can sec the rcason for stationing Pawns on squares of color opposite to that of your Bishop by the following little exercise. Set up a White Bishop on c4 and Pawn on d4 opposed by a Black King on d6. The King wants to cross the fifth rank. To do so, it must traverse as far as the g file in OOC direction (Ke6, [6, gS) or the a file in the other direcion (Kc7, b6 at which point White can transfer the Bishop to d3, but now KaS). Thus we see that a White-squared Bishop in conjunction with a Black-squared Pawn provides a pretty wide barrier against an enemy King. Now transfer the Pawn on d4 to a White square, any White square (e.g. d5, c4, d3), and the King walks straight through. So in assessing how bad a bad Bishop is, or equivalently how weak a weak square complex is with a vk"\\ 1 to the endgame, the main criterion must be: how easily can the opponent's King break in? Lee us look at an exceptional example (Diagram 59). 1 1 3 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 59. a b c d e g h Black has the worst Bishop the world has ever seen and four sick Pawns to defend, yet he cannot lose! Why not? Because the White King can never enter. White can only attack various Pawns with his Bishop, at most two at a time, but the threats are easily parried. Without a King there is no way to win. Now remove the White Pawn from eS. Despite now being a Pawn down, White wins easily because his King can play its part: 1 . KeS Ke7 2 . B d 3 Kf7 3 . Kd6 The Black squarest 3 . B b 7 4 . Kc7 BaS S . Kb 8 wins everything. As a final example to emphasize the power of the King in the ending, we turn to one of Tal's early games, against Lisitsin in the 1956 Soviet Championship. 1 14 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 60. In Diagram 60, Tal (White, to move) has allsorts of problems to solve with his ragged Kingside Pawns, but his opponent has some Black square holes in the center. The only way to play such endgames is to exploit your own advantages as vigorously as possible, even if it means total capitulation elsewhere. Here Tal decides to abandon his Kingside to avoid being drawn into passive defense and concentrate all his efforts on the weak Black squares. 1 . f 5 1 Naturally he chooses the most uncooperative method of surrendering the Kingside. 1 . gxf5 Winning a Pawn, but compromising his Pawn structure to do so.

As SOOn as the central Pawn set-ups crystallize into some sort of permanent structure, the respective good and bad Bishops become self-evident. For example, the French Defense usually creates the Pawn centers d4, eS (White) v. dS, e6 (Black) In which cases each side has a 'bad' QjJcen Bishop. Hence lhe opening variations: 1. e4 e6 2. d4 ds 3. Nc3 Nf6 4. BgS Be7 5. e5 Nfd7

NO Bd7 followed by ... BbS. Black's idea is always a White square strategy, i.e. exchange his Queen Bishop for the opposing King Bishop and later infiltrate on the White square. WhHe's plan is [he exact opposite (exchange Black-squared Bishops and come in on the Black squares). Look back at the Tarrasch-Teichmann ending (Diagram 56). That arose from a French Defense in which White managed to trade Black-squared Hishops early in the game. To look in some detail at the mechanics of a color strategy in the opening/middlegame we shall turn our attention to the King's Indian Defense. Structurally speaking the KJ.D. is merely a French Defense seen through a mirror, but for some reason or other King's Indian strategy always seems more involved than its reflected counterpart. The following White-square strategy worked out by Petrosian is both subtle and llIuminating: 1 . d4 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. Nc3 Bg7
4. e4 d6 5 . Be2 O-O 6. Nf3 e5 7. d5
8 7 6 5 4 3 2 6 1 . a b c d e g h Classically these dosed King's Indian positions lead to a race. White plays for 1.5, Black counters with ...f5 and may the best man win! Petroslan's idea is to maneuver for control of the White squares so as to take the sting out of Black's ...f5 counter before launching his own Queenside operations. After all the c5 attack is inherent from the Pavm structure and so wlll never disappear. Let us see how his idea operates by following a game Petrosian-Yuchtman: 7 .

There are essentially two types of White-square strategy. The first is as above: given a IJXed Pawn slructure in which the enemy Pawns are already on Black squares, you exchange White-squared Bishops with a view to setting up outposts or penetrating On White squares. The second is the same idea back to front: given a more fluid Pawn set-up and that your opponent already has relinquished his White squared Bishop, you lry to draw his Pawns onto Black squares. The objective is the same-to give the opponent a Black square Pawn formation, with no Bishop to plug the gaps, but the build-up Is different. 63. a b c d e g h The positiOn in Diagram 63 arose from the opening of the game Stean-Plan!nc, Moscow 1975.

Pieces need to be kept active and used economically. All the objectives of �imple chess can be traced back to this underlying notion. Outposts are springboards from which piece� can generate activity, weak Pawns hamper mobility because they require protection, 'bad' Bishops are bad because their movements are restricted. However, the single most important factOr in determining mobility must be space, but what is space? Terms like 'White has the freer game', 'White hal; greater control', 'Black is cramped', crop up frequently in annotations, but what do they really mean and how is space apportioned? Unlike the ideas expressed so far in this book, space is nOl an easily definable or recognizable concept. The visual impression you obtain by glancing at a posicion and estimating who seems to have the lion's share can be misleading. The following is nearer the truth. Any given Pawn strm.1ure has a certain capacity for accommodating pieces efficiently. Exceed this capacity and the pk-'Ccs get' in each other's way, and so reduce their mutual activity. This problem of overpopulation is easy to sense when playing a position-it 'feels' cramped. To take an example, compare Diagrams 68 and 69. 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 68. a b c d e g h 69. a b c d c g h They do, of course, represent the same position, but with two pairS of minor pieces Jess In lhe second case. In Diagram 68 Black is terribly congested. There is no way he is ever going to be allowed to play ... b5, while alternative methods of seeking some breathing space by (after due preparation) ... c6 or ... fS would compromise his Pawn structure considerably. White on the other hand can build up at leisure for an eventual eS, safe in the knowledge that 50 long as he avoid!> any piece exchange, his adversary will never be able to free his game. Diagram 69 is qUite a comrast. The size of Black's forces is here well within his pOSition'S 'capacity', As a result there arc no spatial problems at all and Black can very quickly seize the initiative by ... a6 and ...bS, or even by ... hS as a Pawn sacrifice, e.g. 1. .. h5 2. cxhS a6 3. bxa6 Rxa6 with tremendous pressure. We see from this pair of positions that Black's structure is very good, but his I ' capacity is small. Visually White has a spatial advantage In both cases, but in [he second the eye flatters to deceive. In j' faCt, he is grossly overextended. A vast empire requires an army of equal proportions to defend it. . Space is the most difficult clement of chessstrategy to understand. As we have just seen ni Diagram 68, a position can be structurally very sound but actually very bad because of spatial problems. The real test of our insight into the nlec.hanics of an advantage in space comes when confronted by a completely sound (structurally), solid but cramped po.�ition. How do you exploit such an advantage in space? Fischer provides all the answers. White: R.J. Fischer, Black: F. Ghcorghiu Buenos Aires 1970

situation is by exchanges so Black prepares ... B1's to exchange Bishops, thus liberating the d7 square for his QJJ .een which In turn allows the Rook a clear path to e8. For White's part it is sufficient to prevent this plan. When you have a spatial advantage there need be no hurry to form an active plan, that will come in due course. The impOrtant thing is to keep your oppOnent bottled up and put the onus on him to create active play. To do so he will be forced to weaken his own position somewhere. Only then do you pounce on him. 1 5 . d S White would prefer to hold his Pawns on d4 and c4, but this advance in conjunction with Nd4 is the only way to prevent Black's freeing plan.

3 5 . f3 and Black resigns. So we see how easy it can be (or rather seem to be) to squeeze an opponent to death without any recourse to violence. The strategy behind playing to exploit a space advantage is twofold: 0) Deprive the opponent of any counterplay, avoiding exchanges whenever possible. The psychological pressure of being permanently hemmed in may well induce him to weaken himself in order to gain some freedom. (il) If no weaknesses are forthcoming you must be prepared to attack on either wing. Greater space control gives you better communication between flanks, so you naturally want to exploit this fact to build up against the adversary's weaker front. In our last game, Fischer chose to attack on the Kingside because of the sparsity of Black forces in that region, Had the Black pieces been concentrated on the Kingside he would have resorted to a Queenside advance (b4 and cS). Flexibility of thought is needed to make use of flexibility on the board. 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 73. a b c d c g h You have doubtless seen the move sequence: 1. e4 e5 2 . Nf3 Ne6 3. Bb5 a6 4. Ba4 Nf6 5.

Never in the history of chess have so many moves been repeated so often so quickly by so many people who didn't really understand them. Have you ever examined these well tried and trusted moves with a critical eye? ·Why, for example, should White spend twelve moves to develop just four pieces? Why waste four of these moves to preserve a Bishop which will In all probability later become 'bad' when White blocks the center with dS? By answering these queStiOns, we can gain a lot of insight into White's overall strategy in the Lopez. The first and most primitive idea behind 3. BbS is to lay seige to Black's e Pawn which will subsequently be liquidated by d4, thereby opening rhe floodgates for the White Pawn center to scatter the enemy forces with the allied pieces following up to rout the broken army-no prisoners taken. Black cannot however be forced to surrender the center. By keeping his own e Pawn finnly defended Black can thwart allWhite's aspiralions of conquest in the center, but this will lead to a rather cramped position. So the offspring of White's plan is an advantage in space due to the necessity for his opponent to maintain a firm central barricade. This spatial plus however is not very big and the only way to maintain it is by avoiding any exchange of pieces. Black's position (Diagram 73) has sufficient 'capacity' for three minor pieces, but not dearly enough for all four of them. This explains why White is willing to invest so much time early in the game (BbS, Ba4, Bb3, Be2, h3) purely to avoid exchanges. If his spatial strategy is to succeed he must leave Black with four minor pieces. These dosed Ruy Lopez positions are some of lhe most subtle and complex in the whole opening repertoire. It is probably no coincidence that nearly allthe great players of recent times have been deadly exponents of the Ruy Lopez. In the hands of Fischer or Karpov 3. BbS sometimes appears to win by force. For example, Karpov Westerinen, Nice 1974. 1 . e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3 . BbS a6 4. Ba4 d6 S. O-O Bd7 6. d4 Nf6 7. c3 f Be7 B. Nbd2 O-O 9. Rei ReB 10. Nfl h6 1 1 .

It is very reasonable to assume that any position with an advamage In space will offer scope to translate the spatial plus into a structural one. •

Nf6 Black's moves from this juncture are, essentially, irrelevant. There is no way he can in the long run hope to hold his Queenside position, which has the look of Custer's last stand about it. Although he has only one vulnerable Pawn (d6), Black's pieces are so starved of space that they are themselves becoming targets of attack. After all, we only normally choose to attack Pawns because of their inability to run away, but when the pieces themselves have no escape squares why not go in search of bigger game? 2 4 .

Undoubtedly the most difficult game in the book to understand. One can only really begin to appreciate the Idea of converting spatial advantages into structural ones when the latter have been fully absorbed and understood. The dosed Ruy Lopez positions represent a very fine balance between space and structure which only becomes apparent after many years of experIence with them. When you understand the Lopez, you have mastered simple chess. Our brief excursion into the Ruy Lopez has scratched the surface of some of the deeper aspects of chess strategy, but we will proceed no further in this direction. The idea of this book is to keep things simple, so let us look at some of the more direct consequences of spatial advantages. Space, or lack of it, is generally used as a way of persuading the opponent to make structural concessions. Let us take for example a (quite common) Pawn structure, Diagram 78. 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 78. a b c d e g h Black's set-up is very sound but its 'capacity' is low, so given a position with some major pieces and a few minor pieces each, he would have some Spatial problems. Structurally speaking he has two ways to combat them: (i) Undermine White's center by ... bS. This is the positionally correct method, but is in practice often difficult to organize as White can usually keep quite a strong grip on the bS square (with, say, Knight on d4, c3, Bishop on fl-a6 diagonal). An added problem si that moving the b Pawn gives White an outpost on c6 for his Knight. (jj) Challenge White's Pawn wedge by ... e6. But this creates structural weaknesses. The Black d Pawn is left very weak after White exchanges Pawns on e6 and the Black Kingside is also weakened somewhat. Practice has shown that Pawn structure akin to Diagram 78 are very favorable for White providing that Black's minority anack ... b5 can be prevented. In this case the exploitation of White's spatial advantage is not all difficult to understand. He can utilize his greater control and communication between wings to launch a direct Kingside attack.

Of course, the \. . hole plan can be prevented by Black playing ...e6 at almost any stage, but this would leave him with a very sick d Pawn on an open file.

Indeed, one might even venture to say that Black has a slight structural superiority because he has some pressure on the base of White's Pawn center (c4) and first option on the b file, whereas the counterpressure against the base of Black's center (d6) is not evident. Once again the trouble with Black's position is with communications. His Queenside position is a favorable one, but Jacks contact with the rest of the war effort. If White can successfully conduct a holding operation on the Queenside, some of Black's pieces (particularly the Knight on as) wil! be left very much out of play. 1 6 .

For the moment White's pOsition looks to be the more passive, as indeed it il;. But at this point the spatial cOnsideration begins to take over. Black's position has already almost reached its peak. He has no capacity to expand or exect more pressure without creating weaknesses in his own camp. On the other hand, the White forces although temporarily at a low ebb, have plenty of opportunity to drive forward in the longer term because of the greater space potentially available to them. l B .

You see no targets in the enemy position and no way to force any weaknesses, but merely attempt to fortify your own position allowing simplification only when absolutely necessary or clearly favorable in the belief that your opponent will some time feel obliged to make concrete concessions in terms of Pawn weaknesses or outposts in order to avoid suffocation. The difficult part of a spatial strategy lies not In the execution which is relatively simple, but in the recognition of the fact that you actually do have an advantage in space. As already mentioned, the vital criterion is not necessarily whether you 'appear' to control more of the board. This is undoubtedly a yardstick, but not always an accurate one. The real criterion is whether your opponent has more pieces than can comfortably fit in with his Pawn structure, and this you can only really expect to assess correctly on the basis of experience. From your O\'t'llgames and by studying master games you can gradually acquire a feeling for the 'capacity' (as I earlier termed It) of certain Pawn structures. Space is not an easy concept to define with precision or understand with clarity, but time and practice \'lill sharpen your awareness of It as a factor in chess. J have tried throughout the book to lay down principles and put fon-vard ideas that relate to all phases of the game, opening, middlegame, and endgame, and space is no exception. The role played by space in the endgame is in fact much more straightfonvard than In the middlegame. In the endings the King assumes greater power and, consequently, value. The advantage of being first to occupy the center with your King is considerable. He who commands more space has more squares for his Kitlg, it's as simple as that. More space means a potentially stronger King. f -g h White: T. Petrosian, Black: L. Portisch Candidate's Match (5th Game) 1974 1',\ 1 1 . c4 Nf6 2. Nf3 h6 3. g3 e5 4. Bg2 '"Bg'-r 5. O-O e6
