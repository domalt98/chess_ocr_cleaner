Chapter Two The Spirit of Defense Chapter Three New Defense Chapter Four Weapons of Defense Chapter Five Counterplay Chapter Six Risk Management Chapter Seven Sacrifice Chapter Eight Prophylaxis Chapter Nine You Against Tal Chapter Ten Last Chance to Defend Solutions 3 Introduction This book came about because of something I didn't expect to find in my bookcase. It was one of my earliest efforts, The Art of Defense in Chess. I had fond memories of it so I opened it up and leafed through the pages. It was not what I remembered. The book was drastically out of date. This has to be completely rewritten, I thought. Out of date? A book about defense? Yes, because much of what I wrote - about the virtues of solid but passive restraint, for instance - makes little sense nowadays. It would fail against today's attacking players. They think differently from those of 30-plus years ago. In 1974, the year I wrote The Art of Defense in Chess, this would have been considered a favorable position for White, a plus-over-equals advantage, at least: White has a substantial advantage in space. Black has failed to execute any of the freeing moves, such as ... b5 or ... d5, that he needs to survive in this Maroczy Bind pawn structure. White will eventually find a winning plan, such as with ♖e3, ♘g5, ♖h3 and a breakthrough around h7. And White's attack would likely have succeeded if Black played in the manner that served so well for much of the 20th century, with cautious moves such as ... ♘f8 to protect h7 and to avert 2 e5? because of 2 ... ♗xf3 3 gxf3 dxe5 and ... ♕xd3. But today most masters would prefer to play Black, particularly after 1 ... ♕a8!. 4 Why? Because we realize now that White's space advantage, in this and similar positions, is vastly overrated. And we see Black has a powerful plan of 2 ... ♖fc8 and 3 ... ♖xc4! 4 ♗xc4 ♖xc4. That trumps anything White is doing on the kingside. But you can't sacrifice in even positions, can you? That's what 1974 would say if it could speak. Yes, you can, we say today. Black would have one pawn for the Exchange and powerful pressure on the e4-pawn as compensation after 4 ... ♖xc4. In fact, White retreated 2 ♕h3 (!) to anticipate threats along the a8-g2 diagonal. He was no longer acting as an attacker. He was beginning to think like a defender. Black continued to think like a counter-aggressor, with 2 ... ♖ec8. In the next diagram, 3 ♘g5 would try to take Black's attention away from ... ♖xc4. It would offer good practical chances after 3 ... h6 4 ♘xf7! ♔xf7 5 e5, for example. What should Black do after 3 ♘g5? Here's where the solid 3 ... ♘f8! makes sense and would put the pressure back on White. In the game, White chose 3 e5 instead of 3 ♘g5. But 3 ... dxe5 4 fxe5 ♘h5 would 5 threaten ... ♗xf3/... ♘xe5. If White defends with 5 ♗e2 it would be time for 5 ... ♖xc4! 6 ♗xc4 ♖xc4. Black would have the upper hand in view of 7 ... ♗xf3 and 7 ... ♘f4. Instead, play went 3 e5 dxe5 4 ♘xe5 and then 4 ... ♘xe5 5 fxe5 ♘d7. There was only one way to protect the e5-pawn, 6 ♗f4. Black finally pulled the trigger, 6 ... ♖xc4! 7 ♗xc4 ♖xc4. If he wins the e5-pawn he will have more than enough 'comp' for the Exchange and excellent winning chances. White's 8 ♕g3 was natural (but 8 ♘e2 was better). And 8 ... h5! was a surprise. Instead of trying to cash in, 8 ... ♗xg2+ 9 ♕xg2 ♕xg2+ 10 ♔xg2 ♖xf4, Black was content to build pressure with the threat of 9 ... h4! and, if allowed, 10 ... h3!. Unfortunately for White, this illustrates a fact of defensive life: It is easier to safeguard a compact position than one with pieces and pawns spread over a large area, as White's forces are. His 9 ♘e2? was a final error, punished by 9 ... ♘xe5! (based on 10 ♗xe5 ♖g4). The rest of the game was interesting chiefly because of the finish: 10 ♖xc4 ♘xc4 11 h4 ♕d8 12 ♗g5 ♕d7 13 ♘f4 e5! 14 ♘d3 ♕d5 15 ♘f2 ♘d6 16 ♖d1. 6 And 16 ... ♘e4! prompted resignation. This is the way chess is played today. Anyone who plays over attacking games of the 21st century will be struck by how they differ from 20th century games. You can argue that the biggest change since the 1970s is that our play has been refined by computer analysis. But it was transformed earlier by the revolution in middlegame thinking led by Mikhail Tal. Strangely enough, it was the greatest attacker of modern times who inspired new methods of defense. Why? Because Tal changed the way sacrifices and the initiative were evaluated: He won many games because his opponents had never before been confronted by a highly speculative sacrifice. Or by an attack launched by Black right out of the opening. Or by complications that defy exact analysis. Tal presented a way to attack that confounded traditional defensive thinking. But according to the iron law of strategy, the defense always catches up with the offense. This book is about how a different approach evolved to meet the demands of changing times. This is New Defense. 7 Chapter One: What is Defense? When the first edition of this book appeared, readers told me how struck they were by the very first example. It wasn't a famous game. Far from it. But there was something about the way it unfolded: Klyavin - Zhdanov, Latvian Championship 1961
1 e4 c6 2 ♘c3 d5 3 ♘f3 g6 4 d4 ♗g7 5 h3 a6 6 ♗f4 ♘f6? 7 e5 ♘g8 8 ♕d2 b5 9 ♗e2
h6 10 O-O-O e6 It didn't take readers long to conclude that White has a very strong position. He has brought out nearly all of his pieces while Black's only developed piece, his KB, 'bites on granite' at e5. Black's queenside is riddled with holes on dark squares and he has just locked in his other bishop. You might expect a quick mating attack. You would be right:
11 g4 ♘d7 12 ♗g3 ♗f8! 13 ♖df1 ♘b6 14 ♘d1 a5 15 ♘e1 b4 16 ♘d3 ♘c4 17 ♕e1
♕b6 18 b3 ♕xd4! 19 bxc4 ♕a1+ 20 ♔d2 dxc4 21 ♘f4 ♕xa2 22 ♔e3!? ♗b7 23 ♕d2 g5 24 ♘h5 c3 25 ♕d3 ♖d8 26 ♕e4 ♗c5+ 27 ♔f3 ♖d4 28 ♕e3 ♕d5+ and mates Yes, Black delivered the mate. Actually, with a good understanding of defensive play the game's result should not be at all surprising to you. But that understanding is the most difficult chess knowledge to acquire. And it is worth acquiring. It should be no surprise that great players are great defenders. When Garry Kasparov was asked during his great rivalry with Anatoly Karpov why they dominated chess he replied, "We attack better than anyone else - and we defend better than anyone else." 8 Before we get into specific techniques and approaches to defense, let's dispose of some myths. What is defense, really? Defense is dull. How defense got a reputation as plodding and boring is a mystery. Good defense is intensely tactical. It is perhaps 90 percent tactics - and in some positions, more. The defender must rely more on tactics than his opponent does. Schneider - Benjamin, U.S. Chess League 2013
1 e4 e5 2 ♘f3 d6 3 d4 exd4 4 ♕xd4 a6 5 ♗g5 ♘c6 6 ♕d2 ♗e7 7 h4 ♘f6 8 ♘c3 h6 9
♗f4 b5 10 O-O-O!? b4! 11 ♘d5 ♘xe4 12 ♕e3 ♘c5 Aron Nimzovich, a great defender, warned against pawn grabbing in the opening. But he made an exception for swiping a center pawn. Here Black spent two tempi to win the e4-pawn. He is ready to beat back a White initiative with simple moves such as ... ♗e6, ... ♘e6 or ... ♗g4. White felt he had to strike now with 13 ♘xc7+ ♕xc7. However, the natural 14 ♗xd6 fails to 14 ... ♕a7!, when everything is protected and he will be able to consolidate with 15 ... ♘e6. Instead, White chose 14 ♖xd6!, which threatened 15 ♕xc5 and 15 ♖xh6! (15 ... ♖xh6 16 ♗xc7). Traditional defensive thinking stressed the importance of parrying immediate threats. Well, of course, that is important. But if parrying threats were all that mattered, Black would look no further than 14 ... ♕b6. And he would have had his work cut out for him after 15 ♗c4 followed by ♘d4 and ♖e1. Instead, Black began a counter-attack, seeking mate no less, with 14 ... b3!!. He can answer 15 ♖xh6 with 15 ... ♖xh6 16 ♗xc7 bxa2! and replace the lost queen with a new one (17 ♕a3 ♘d3+!). Traditional defensive thinking would say White's chief responsibility is to find a way to stop ... bxa2. But on 15 axb3 Black would continue to counterattack with 15 ... ♘b4! and 16 ... ♕a5. In fact, 15 a3 would also be met by 15 ... ♘b4! because 16 axb4 ♘e6! would threaten mate on c2 as well as 17 ... ♗xd6 and 17 ... ♘xf4. Instead, White found a move that both attacks and defends, 15 ♗c4, and there followed 15 ... bxa2 16 ♗xa2 ♘b4. Black threatens 17 ... ♘xa2+, of course. But the more dangerous idea is 17 ... ♘cd3+! and mate around c2. The surprises kept coming. White found 17 ♗xf7+!, based on 17 ... ♔xf7 18 ♖f6+ and ♗xc7. Black replied 17 ... ♔f8 and on 18 ♗g6 he was finally able to take the rook, 18 ... ♘cd3+! 19 ♗xd3 ♗xd6 20 ♗xd6+ ♕xd6. With only two pawns for a rook, the game must be over, right? Well, that was a common attitude many years ago. Now we know it's usually a dangerous way for a defender to think. White found new ways to exploit Black's king position, 21 ♗e4 ♖b8 22 ♘d4 ♔f7 23 ♖e1 and then 23 ... ♖d8 24 ♕b3+ ♔f8 25 ♖e3, preparing ♖f3+. Black blocked, 25 ... ♘d5! 26 ♖f3+ ♘f6, and walked through the final flurry of checks, 27 ♖xf6+ gxf6 28 ♕e3 ♕xd4! 29 ♕xh6+ ♔e7 30 ♕g7+ ♔d6 31 ♕g3+ ♕e5 32 ♕d3+ ♔e7 33 ♕a3+ ♕d6 White resigns. So, defense is not at all dull. But there are other myths to debunk: Defense is one-dimensional. The charge that defensive play is mechanical, unimaginative and with little room for variety is also unfounded. This is a position from a popular Sicilian Defense variation, the Keres Attack, that begins 1 e4 c5 2 ♘f3 d6 3 d4 cxd4 4 ♘xd4 ♘f6 5 ♘c3 e6 6 g4. White's intent is no secret: he seeks a pawn storm with g4-g5, followed perhaps by h2-h4-h5 and g5-g6 to open lines around Black's king. Black's biggest problem is that he has too many ways to try to defend: He can try to strike in the center with 6 ... d5 or 6 ... e5. This is a traditional policy. But there are tactical problems after 6 ... d5 7 exd5, e.g. 7 ... exd5 8 g5 ♘e4 9 ♕e2 or 7 ... ♘xd5 8 ♗b5+! ♗d7 9 ♘xd5 exd5 10 ♕e2+! ♕e7 11 ♗e3 and Black's disorganized pieces face a dangerous initiative. Another natural policy is to trade pieces. But again that's faulty here, e.g. 6 ... ♘c6 7 g5 ♘xd4? 8 ♕xd4 ♘d7 9 ♗e3 leaves White with dominating control of the center. More promising are the strategies that take the sting out of g4-g5 with 6 ... h6 or counterattack with 6 ... a6 and ... b5-b4. But 6 ... h6 ensures that kingside lines will be opened after g4-g5/... hxg5 and a recapture on g5. And 6 ... a6 is slow. Black can even anticipate White's advance with 6 ... ♘fd7 and ... ♘b6 - but that's even slower. Let's see how this kind of choice works in a middlegame position. Once again White is shooting for a quick g4-g5. Classical thinking said an attack like this should be answered by a strike in the center, 1 ... d5. But here there is little compensation after 2 exd5 e4 and simply 3 ♗g2. A second approach is to anticipate White, with what we call prophylaxis. Black can retreat immediately with 1 ... ♘e8. His aim is to play 2 ... ♗g5!, seize control of key kingside squares and offer a piece trade. But White can play 2 ♕d2!. That stops ... ♗g5 and prepares a protected push of his g-pawn. A more successful version of that idea is 1 ... h6 followed by ... ♘h7 and perhaps ... ♘g5. That is stodgy but solid. Black chose the most ambitious alternative, 1 ... h5!. This is characteristic of New Defense thinking: Confront, confound, confuse. If White tries to maintain his pawn at g4, with 2 h3 hxg4 3 hxg4, Black could employ a better version of the 3 ... ♘h7! idea. And on 2 gxh5 Black has a superior version of the center strike idea, 2 ... d5!. Then on 3 exd5 ♗xf5 the attack is blunted and Black will regain his pawn by taking on c2 (or on d5 after 4 ... e4). But the real key to Black's play was revealed when he met White's reply, 2 g5, with 2 ... ♘g4! 3 ♗xg4 ♗xg5!. This works because the tactics, 4 ♗xg5 ♕xg5 and ... ♕xg4+, would favor him. White found the superior 4 ♖e1 hxg4 5 ♔h1. He prepares to use the halfopen g- file. But more important, he safeguards his king from tactics on the g1-a7 diagonal. (Compare this with 5 ♕xg4 ♗xe3+ 6 ♖xe3 ♕b6! 7 ♖ae1 ♖xc3! 8 bxc3 ♘xc2.) With 1 ... h5 Black overturned traditional defensive thinking, which said that you should not voluntarily advance the pawns in front of your castled king. He further violated it with 5 ... g6!. This makes sense because 6 fxg6 fxg6 would give him greater kingside control than White. White accepted the challenge with 6 ♕xg4! and then 6 ... ♗xe3 7 ♖xe3 ♘xc2 8 ♖g3!. When an attacker's pieces outnumber the defender's in a target area - like the kingside here - favorable tactics are likely, if not inevitable. For example 8 ... ♘xa1? 9 ♕h5 threatens a quick mate after fxg6 or ♕h6. Key lines are 9 ... ♗e8 10 ♕h6! followed by ♖h3 and 9 ... ♕f6 10 ♘d5 ♕h8 11 ♘e7+ ♔g7 12 ♖xg6+!. But the philosophy of New Defense says White is not the only player entitled to sacrifice. Black battled back with 8 ... ♖xc3! and then 9 bxc3 ♘xa1. The attack would be over and Black would have all the winning chances after 10 ♘xa1 ♕f6. White had one last bullet to fire, 10 ♕h5!. But Black replied 10 ... ♗e8! so he could meet 11 ♕h6 and 12 ♖h3 with 11 ... ♕f6 and ... ♕g7. The sparkling game ended in perpetual check after 11 fxg6 fxg6 12 ♖xg6+! ♗xg6 13 ♕xg6+. Good defense can mean finding a single, good tactical shot. But more often it requires ten or more moves of hard work. When your opponent has several positional advantages he may be able to press you and press you. Finding one great defensive move won't be enough to save you. White has a dominating bishop and what appears to be decisive pressure against the queenside pawns (1 ... ♖b6 2 a5 or 1 ... ♘d8? 2 e6+! ♕g7 3 ♗e5). But Black had sought this position because of 1 ... a5!. Then 2 ♕xc6 ♕xc6 3 ♖xc6 axb4 and 4 ♗xb4 ♖xb4 5 ♖xe6 ♖axa4 would liquidate into a very drawish endgame. But 1 ... a5 just met the first crisis. White created a new one with 2 bxa5! and then 2 ... c5! 3 ♕f3!- not 3 ♗xc5? ♖c7 4 ♕b4 ♖ab7 or 4 ♕e3 d4. After 3 ... d4 he could not hold his extra pawn. But he got good heavy piece play by means of 4 ♖b3! ♖xb3 5 ♕xb3 ♖xa5 6 ♖b1. This is what a good aggressive player does when his initiative is waning: He converts his positional or material advantage into something equally good. Now instead of pressure against mere pawns White is aiming higher, with ♕d5 or ♕b8+ (6 ... ♖xa4? 7 ♕b8+ ♔g7 8 ♖b7 or 7 ... ♘d8 8 e6). Black needed to pass more tests and did it with 6 ... ♔g7 7 ♕d5 ♔h6!. With his king secure he can fight back against 8 ♖b7 with 8 ... ♕xa4 and ... ♕d1+. White secured his own king's safety with 8 ♔g2 and then 8 ... ♕f7 9 ♔f2 (to stop ... ♘xf4+). Black appeared to be close to running out of moves after 9 ... ♕d7 10 ♖b2! in view of 10 ... ♖a7 11 a5 and 12 a6. But Black wasn't done. He found 10 ... ♖xa4! 11 ♖b7 ♖a2+!. This works because 12 ♕xa2 ♕xb7 13 ♕xe6 ♕b2+ leads to the same kind of perpetual check we saw earlier (14 ♔g1 ♕c1+ 15 ♔g2 ♕d2+ 16 ♔h3 ♕e2!). And 12 ♔e1, for example, risks losing after 12 ... ♕a4!. The hard work demanded of defenders leads to another myth: Defense is unrewarding. Amateurs often complain that even if they manage to meet all of their opponent's threats the best that they can hope for is a draw. Of course, that's better than losing. But it seems to many players that the defender puts in a lot of work at the board for a minimum return. Actually, defense often pays off handsomely because it is harder to defend. The attacker may have an easy time picking from among the forcing moves at his disposal. The more alert defender can upset the lazy attacker by finding the flaw in his attack. In addition, when a player organizes his pieces for attack they are usually ill- prepared for defense: Attacks often fail. Counterattacks rarely do. Black's king has to deal with dangers such as ♕h5/♖h3 followed by ♕h6+! and mate. White played the natural - but lazy - 1 ♕h5?. (Better was 1 ♖g3 first, with unclear chances.) Black replied 1 ... ♗xg2!. This is justified by 2 ♔xg2? ♘f4+ and ... ♘xh5. It is based on something that defense-hating amateurs need to constantly remember: The defender has just as much right to use tactics as the attacker. Shaken by 1 ... ♗xg2!, White replied with 2 f3, to trap the bishop and create a king escape square at f2. Black could have tried to extricate the bishop, say with 2 ... ♕f4. But he took command of the kingside instead with 2 ... ♘f4! and then 3 ♕xh7+ ♔f8. Tactics have turned him into the attacker. He threatens to win with discovered checks on the g-file. He could punish 4 ♕h6+ ♔e7 5 ��f2 with 5 ... ♖h8! and the queen is trapped. The game ended quickly: 4 ♔f2 ♘h3+ 5 ♔e1 ♕f4 6 ♖ad3 ♗f1! 7 ♖e4 ♗xd3! White resigned (or 7 ♔xf1 ♖g1+ 8 ♔e2 ♕xh2 mate). And let's dispose of one final myth: You only learn defense through experience. You hear this all the time: "You can't teach yourself how to defend. It comes from playing hundreds of games." Or, rather, "It comes from losing hundreds of games." Now, it's true that some of the attributes of good defenders, such as patience and coolness under fire, are hallmarks of veteran players. They have learned to take their time and how to deal with crises. But some of history's greatest defenders - Anatoly Karpov and Sammy Reshevsky, for example - developed those skills when they were very young. And there was also a certain 11-year-old who showed us how to defend: With considerable ingenuity White had created a powerful passed pawn at c6. In an endgame that would likely be a decisive factor. But the d5-pawn that protects the c6-pawn is threatened by ... ♕xd5. And 1 ♘a3 would be met by 1 ... ♘f6 2 ♗c4 ♗e4. Magnus Carlsen played 1 ♕f3. He knew that 1 ... g5 looked dangerous because 2 ... g4 would knock his queen away and either win the d-pawn or continue his kingside initiative. His reply, 2 g4!, was strong because White would get control of the light squares following 2 ... ♗g6 3 ♗d3! or 2 ... fxg3 3 hxg3 and ♘e3. For better or worse, 2 ... e4 was the natural reply ... ... and so was 3 ♖xe4! and 3 ... ♗xe4 4 ♕xe4+. At fairly cheap expense (a pawn for the Exchange) White secured his kingside and his pawn chain. Play continued 4 ... ♔g8 5 ♗d3. Black was not done. He was able to stabilize the queenside, 5 ... b5 6 ♘a3 a6 7 ♕f3 ♘c7, and then put his rooks to work on the open file, 8 ♗e4 ♖e8 9 ♕d3 ♖e5 10 ♗c3 ♖e7. White is one piece - a well-placed knight - away from proving he has a big edge. He would like to play 11 ♘c2 and then ♘d4-f5. But 11 ... ♗xc3 12 ♕xc3 ♖xe4 costs a piece. So he settled for 11 ♘b1, with ideas such as ♘d2-b3-d4 and f2-f3. Black appreciated how desperate his situation was and went for the highrisk 11 ... f3. The pawn will be lost there but he wanted to stop the stabilizing f2-f3 and create the option of ... ♕f4 and an undermining ... h5. He gets some e-file play after, say, 12 ♕xf3 ♖ae8. White responded 12 ♖e1! ♗xc3 13 ♘xc3 ♕f4 14 h3. This was the time for 14 ... h5 (15 gxh5 g4 and 16 ♔h1 or 16 ♕e3 is still difficult). But Black's 14 ... ♖f8? was too slow and White took command with 15 ♖e3! h5 16 ♖xf3 ♕c1+ 17 ♔g2. He would have been winning in the long run after 17 ... hxg4 18 hxg4. But Carlsen used tactics to win faster with 17 ... hxg4 18 ♗h7+! ♖xh7 19 ♖xf8+ ♔xf8 20 ♕xh7 ♕xc3 21 ♕f5+. He had foreseen that he can win the knight and the d-pawn with checks: 21 ... ♔e7 22 ♕d7+ ♔f8 23 ♕xd6+ ♔e8 24 ♕d7+ ♔f8 25 ♕f5+!. Now 25 ... ♔e8 26 ♕c8+! and 27 ♕xc7+/hxg4 is an easy win. Black chose 25 ... ♔e7. Here 26 ♕xg5+ is tempting but there's a lot of game left after 26 ... ♔f7. White found the more accurate 26 d6+! and Black resigned (26 ... ♔xd6 27 ♕d7+ forces 27 ... ♔e5, when 28 ♕g7+! skewers the king and queen). Yes, that's an awful lot of calculating. But, as noted earlier, White could also have won with simple moves such as 18 hxg4. You don't have to be a great calculator to be a good defender. You need the right tools, beginning with the proper spirit and attitudes. Let's see what those are. Chapter Two: The Spirit of Defense Good defense is most of all the product of proper spirit. Some players are discouraged if not defeated the minute their opponent seizes the initiative. Others excel at defense because they accept the role as a challenge - and because they know how often good defense wins. Before we look at specific defensive devices, it's important to take stock of the priorities, principles and mental attitudes of good defenders. Let's begin with something all good defenders understand: A weakness is not a weakness if it can't be exploited. That is something the strange Latvian game in the first chapter can teach us. Who really stands better? We say White must have the superior chances because of his edge in development. But the value of development depends on how open the position is. That's another way of saying how easy it is to reach a target. In Paul Morphy's day, having two more pieces developed than your opponent could be a decisive advantage. That was because games typically began with 1 e4 e5 and often led to pawn trades that opened attacking files and diagonals and made quick mates possible. (And in Morphy's day, defense was dreadful.) Here Black's position is riddled with apparent weaknesses, like the holes at d6, f6 and a5. But White has no easy way to get a minor piece, ideally a knight, to them. White lacks an accessible target. On the other hand, Black does have a target: the White king. Even though White made no weakening pawn moves, by castling queenside his king became vulnerable to ... ♘d7-b6-c4. Understanding what is a vulnerable weakness and what is just an apparent one is extraordinarily difficult: Topalov - Ivanchuk, Linares 2008
1 e4 c5 2 ♘f3 d6 3 d4 cxd4 4 ♘xd4 ♘f6 5 ♘c3 a6 6 ♗e3 e5 7 ♘b3 ♗e6 8 f3 ♘bd7
9 g4 b5 10 g5 b4 11 ♘d5 ♘xd5 12 exd5 ♗f5 13 ♗d3 ♗xd3 14 ♕xd3 ♗e7 15 h4
This seems like a simple case of opposite wing attacks: White will castle queenside and try to open the kingside with h4-h5 and g5-g6. Black will castle kingside and work the queenside with ... a5-a4. What could be clearer? With that in mind, Black sought a head start with 15 ... a5. White shot back 16 a3! and the question of weaknesses has been turned around. White saw queenside targets that he can exploit after 16 ... bxa3 17 ♖xa3. The Black a-pawn would likely be doomed after ♕b5 and O-O/♖ha1. No better is 16 ... O-O in view of 17 axb4 axb4 18 ♖xa8 ♕xa8 19 ♔e2! followed by ♖a1 and ♘a5-c6. White's king only looks vulnerable on e2. Black continued his plan of queenside pressure, 16 ... a4 17 ♘d2 ♖b8 and play went 18 axb4 ♖xb4. White would have had a clear edge after 19 ♕c3! ♕a5 20 b3 and then 20 ... O-O 21 ♘c4 ♕b5 22 ♗d2!. The same goes for 19 ... ♕b8 20 ♕c6 ♖xb2 21 ♔e2!, when White threatens ♖xa4 and ♖a8. What went wrong for Black? He gave his opponent a target prematurely. The right way was 15 ... O-O! in the first diagram. Then on 16 O-O-O he can play 16 ... a5! and his attack would have a target to hit, the White king, which would be more vulnerable on c1 than e2. If White continues 16 a3 bxa3 17 ♖xa3, as in the game, Black hasn't weakened b5 yet. He could drum up counterplay with 17 ... ♕c7 18 O-O ♖fc8 19 c3 ♘b6 or 18 ♖xa6 ♖xa6 19 ♕xa6 ♕xc2. "A weakness is not a weakness . . ." is an invaluable insight for the defender. There are others, beginning with: Primum Non Nocere Defense comes down to making it hard for an opponent to win. Making the situation worse - by handing him a winning plan - is the ultimate disaster. The words of the Hippocratic oath - Primum Non Nocere (First, Do no harm) - apply to chess players as well as to doctors. Of course, you're going to say, that's obvious. But it's shocking how even GMs flunk this test. Despite White's passed e-pawn, a win is far from likely. It would take several moves before his king can affect events. That's too long. With ... ♖ba8! here or on the next two moves Black could have eliminated the dangerous a-pawn. For example, 1 ... ♖ba8! 2 ♖xb7? ♖xb7 3 axb7 ♖xa1+ and ... ♖b1, or 2 axb7 ♖xa1. Instead he played 1 ... ♗d6 2 h4 ♔g7 3 ♗c4 b6??. This last move was much worse than the missed opportunities for ... ♖ba8. It made ♗b5-c6-b7! a way for White to trap a Black rook. If the Black rooks flee the queenside, White will queen the a-pawn on the square his bishop will control. Black had zero counterplay after 3 ... b6?? and White took his time: 4 ♗b5 h6 5 ♔f1 ♖f8 6 ♔e2 ♖f6 7 ♖b3 ♔f8 8 ♖h3 ♔e7 9 ♔d3 ♔f8 10 ♔c4 ♔g7 11 ♗c6 ♔f8 12 ♔b5! ♔g7 13 ♗b7! ♔f8 14 ♖g1 ♔e7 15 g3!. Black was playing, in effect, a rook down. That means the opening of the kingside, say by 15 ... fxg3 16 ♖hxg3, must lose eventually. He tried 15... f3 16 ♖c1 ♔d8 17 ♖c3 h5 but after 18 ♖h1 ♔e7 19 ♖d1 he resigned. There is no defense to ♖dd3 and ♖xf3, followed by the decisive penetration of a White rook. After "Do no harm" comes a second priority, stopping immediate threats. Your impulse should be to consider the most direct way of preventing an opponent from carrying out a game-winning threat. Again, this sounds obvious but ... White has just traded off his best minor piece, a light-squared bishop, to obtain kingside threats. That's a risky decision because his remaining pieces may be grossly inferior to Black's - provided that Black can deal with the threats. Black can see one danger: ♖f3 and ♖h3 followed by a queen mate on h8 or h7. But he has a more immediate concern. White threatens g5-g6 followed by ♕h7 mate or gxf7+. Can Black create an escape route for his king? Yes, 1 ... ♖c8 and 2 g6 ♖f5 allows ... ♔f8-e7. But 3 ♕h7+ and 4 ♕h8+ is punishing. What about a desperate sacrifice such as 1 ... ♘e7 2 g6 ♕xg6 ? That also stops mate. But a piece down, Black has little chance of salvation. What Black should look for is the one move that stops g5-g6, not just prepares to answer it. Black found 1 ... g6!. It's an easy move to overlook because there is nothing to support that pawn. But after 2 ♕xg6+ ♖g7 White's immediate threats are stopped and his queen is driven back. True, after White played 3 ♕d3 Black could not regain his pawn with 3 ... ♕xb2?? 4 ♖fb1. He settled for a retreat, 3 ... ♘e7!. Black is a pawn down but the nature of the struggle has changed drastically. That's a known defensive technique, as we'll see in a few pages. Now he is the one making threats (... ♗b5!). If White has to play the super- cautious 5 ♖fb1 ♘g6 6 ♕d2 to defend his pawns, Black would have compensation after 6... ♖h7 or 6 ... ♖gf7. White chose 4 ♕b3 instead. Black jumped at the chance for 4 ... ♕xb3! 5 axb3 because his remaining pieces are far superior to White's. This became clearer after 5 ... b6 6 ♗d2 ♘f5 7 ♖f3 ♖h7 8 ♖af1 ♗b5. He eventually won after 9 ♖e1 ♔f7 10 ♔f2 ♖h2 11 ♗c3? ♘h4 12 ♖g3 ♗xf4. Sure, it's obvious that a defender should stop threats from being carried out. But it isn't obvious how to stop them. There are usually several ways to parry a threat. One guideline: It is generally better to parry with a move that both defends as well as threatens. White threatens ♕xf6 but also ♖f4-g4 mate. There are Black moves that stop one threat but allow the other, such as 1 ... ♕b6? 2 ♖f4. The correct method is 1 ... ♕b2!. It protects f6 and allows Black to meet 2 ♖f4 with 2 ... ♖e4!. But in addition, it also threatens 2 ... ♖e2! and ... ♖xg2+ with a quick mate. White tried 2 ♔h1 ♖e2 and saw that 3 ♖f4 fails to 3 ... ♖e1+! 4 ♔h2 ♖e4, the same position as before. So he tried 3 ♗xd5. But this was a blunder that allowed the counterattack, 3 ... ♗xf5! 4 ♕f4 (4 ♖xf5?? ♖e1+) ♗e6 5 ♗f3 ♖h2+ 6 ♔g1 ♖xh3! 7 ♗g2 ♖h5 8 ♕xf6 ♕xf6 9 ♖xf6 ♖a5 and Black won the endgame. So, a good defender tries to meet a threat with an active move, preferably one that makes its own threat. But there is something else to guide the defender. The Principle of Economy Wilhelm Steinitz is credited with this advice: Try to find a way to meet a threat in the least 'expensive' way. That means without giving up material or making major positional concessions. For example, if Black needs to defend his castled position and particularly h7, the economic way is to bring a knight to f6 or f8. In contrast, pushing a pawn to g6 and h6 creates a new weakness. Here's another way to meet a threat to a castled king. Anand - Kramnik, Las Palmas 1996
1 e4 c5 2 ♘f3 d6 3 d4 cxd4 4 ♘xd4 ♘f6 5 ♘c3 ♘c6 6 ♗g5 e6 7 ♕d2 ♗e7 8 O-O-O
♘xd4 9 ♕xd4 O-O 10 f4 ♕a5 11 ♗c4 ♗d7 12 ♖d3 ♖ad8 A good plan for White is ♖g3 with the idea of ♗h6 or ♗xf6. But Black can defend with a minor precaution, 13 ♖g3 ♔h8!. Then on 14 e5 dxe5 15 fxe5 ♗c6 White's queen is attacked by the rook on d8. After 16 ♕e3 ♘g8 the g7 square that was White's main target is safeguarded (17 ♗xe7 ♘xe7 18 ♕g5 ♘g6). His attack would halt as he pauses to meet the threat of 19 ... ♕xe5. If White aims at a new target, h7, with 17 ♗d3, Black would rely on 17 ... ♕b6! and 18 ♕xb6 axb6. But hold on. Aren't doubled pawns an 'expensive' concession? No, they would be no weaker than the White e-pawn. A previous game went 19 ♖e1 ♗xg5+ 20 ♖xg5 ♖d4 21 ♗e4 ♘e7 22 ♖g3 ♖fd8 23 b3 ♘g6 and Black won. In this game White passed up 13 ♖g3. Instead, he played the immediate 13 e5 and after 13 ... dxe5 14 ♕xe5 ... he evaluated - correctly - that this time an endgame would be very good for him, 14 ... ♕xe5 15 fxe5 ♘d5 16 ♗xe7 and 17 ♖hd1. Black defended instead with 14 ... ♕b4, threatening the bishop on c4. He met 15 ♖g3 with 15 ... ♔h8!. Again this quiet move eliminates the gravest dangers to g7. And it's much better than 15 ... ♕xc4 16 ♗xf6 ♗xf6 17 ♕xf6 g6 18 ♖d1 when Black is tied up (18 ... ♗c6? 19 ♖xd8) and facing 19 ♖gd3. Note how well Black's rook at d8 is placed for counterattack after 15 ... ♔h8!. White can set a trap with 16 ♘e4 - so that 16 ... ♘xe4 loses to 17 ♗h6! (17 ... ♗f6 18 ♗xg7+). But Black would foil this with 16 ... ♗c6 (17 ♘xf6?? ♕d2+ 18 ♔b1 ♕d1+ and mates). White found the superior 16 ♗d3 and then 16 ... ♗c6 17 ♖h3. This is what good attack and good defense looks like. One side keeps making threats and the other finds ways to thwart or anticipate them. But how does Black met the new threat of 18 ♗xf6 and 19 ♖xh7+ ? After all, 17 ... h6? fails to 18 ♗xh6. And trying to drive off the rook with 17 ... ♗xg2 invites 18 ♗xf6! ♗xh3 19 ♗xg7+ ♔g8 and now 20 ♗xh7+! ♔xh7 21 ♕h5+ ♔xg7 22 ♖g1+ ♔f6 23 ♕g5 mate. But once again Black made the minimum concession: 17 ... ♖fe8!. Then on 18 ♗xf6 ♗xf6 19 ♖xh7+ ♔f8 his king has an escape route via f8 and e7. For example, 20 ♕h5 ♕xf4+ 21 ♔b1 ♔f8 and Black is better thanks to his powerful bishops (22 ♕e2 ♗xc3). In the game White backed off with 18 ♕e2 and a draw was agreed after 18 ... h6 19 ♖f1 ♔g8 20 ♗h4 ♘d5. There is a danger when facing serious threats - and when you see pretty ways to lose - that you will make concessions that are not only excessive but unnecessary. All of White's pieces are splendidly placed for a knockout blow. He prepares ♘xg6 followed by ♗xf6, among other ideas. Some obvious defensive measures allow White to be brilliant. For example, he can meet 1 ... ♕d8 with 2 ♘xf7! ♔xf7 3 ♖xh7! (3 ... ♘xh7 4 ♕xg6+ and ♕xg7+, or 3 ... ♗e4 4 ♕h6!). Another natural defense, 1 ... ♘d7, loses neatly to 2 ♖xh7! ♔xh7 3 ♗xg6+ fxg6 4 ♕xg6+ ♔g8 and 5 ♕f7+ ♔h7 6 ♘xd7 (or 2 ... ♘xe5 3 ♖xg7+ and 2 ... ♗xe5 3 ♗xg6). Black, a world-class player, chose 1 ... ♖d8. White won a pawn with 2 ♘xg6 fxg6! 3 ♗xf6 ♗xf6 4 ♕xf6 and threatened to win another. Black's 4 ... ♕d6 seemed like a limp bid for a swindle (5 ... ♕d1+ 6 ♗xd1 ♖xd1 mate). White replied 5 h3 and had a new threat, 6 ♖xh7! ♔xh7 7 ♕xg6+ and mates. But 5 ... ♖f8 6 ♕d4 ♖d8 7 ♕f6 e5 8 ♕xd6 ♖xd6 gave Black hope. Winning the endgame would not be easy, e.g. 9 c5 bxc5 10 bxc5 ♖d4. White played 9 ♖g4 instead. Black's rook was suddenly the more active one after 9 ... ♖d2!. An attacking piece, the White rook, is clumsy in defense. The game went 10 ♗b3 ♔g7 11 ♖g3 a5! 12 a3 ♗c6 13 ♖c3 ♔f6 and 14 c5 axb4 15 axb4 b5!. White discovered his b-pawn was lost to 16 ... ♖d4. He conceded a draw after 16 ♔f1 ♖d4 17 f3 ♖xb4 18 ♖d3. After the game, annotators were so charmed by Black's resourceful play that they didn't look for improvements. There are several, including 1... ♘h5 in the first diagram (2 ♖xh5 f6! 3 ♕g4 f5! and Black is better). Another is 1 ... ♘d5!, which wins. For example, 2 cxd5 ♕xc3 or 2 ♗b2 ♗f6. In other words, Black chose the practical concession 1 ... ♖d8? - which could have cost the game - when he should have been looking for ways to turn the table. In fact, the defender should always be looking for an opportunity to drastically alter the position. This can be done with a dramatic move, a sacrifice or something else that changes the nature of the struggle. Changing the Nature When the game is beginning to take a trend you don't like you may have to take strong measures. White is a pawn down but his last move, ♖f1-f4, dreams of mate on h8 or h7 after ♖h4. If Black brings in reinforcements to the kingside, 1 ... ♘f6, he walks into 2 e5!, which threatens the knight as well as ♖fxc4. Black decided to seek refuge in a trade of rooks, with 1 ... ♗a6. But 2 fxg6 was an unpleasant surprise. He realized that 2 ... fxg6, the move he intended, would be met by 3 ♖xc8 ♖xc8 and then 4 ♕g4! with winning threats of ♕xd7 and ♕e6+ (or 4 ... ♘f8 5 ♕xc8). Black had to retake 2 ... hxg6. White continued as planned with 3 ♖h4. This looked scary. On 3 ... ♖xc3 White can play 4 ♗d2, after which 5 ♗xc3 would threaten the queen on a5 as well as ♖h8 mate. On other Black moves, White will play 4 ♕d2!, which threatens 5 ♕h6 followed by mate on h7 or h8, as well as 5 ♖xc8! ♕xd2 6 ♖xf8+ and 7 ♗xd2. With the wrong attitude, Black might conclude that these variations represented an appropriate way for the game to end. But with the right attitude, Black concluded that he needed to change a very bad trend. He did it with 3 ... ♖xc3! 4 ♗d2 ♖fc8! 5 ♗xc3 ♖xc3. Then 6 bxc3 ♕xc3 would allow the queen to defend the kingside and give him ample compensation for the lost Exchange. In an endgame, his passed a-pawn is a dangerous, perhaps winning, asset. It was White's turn to try to change the trend. He found 6 ♕d2! so that 6 ... ♖c5 7 b4! ♕c7 8 bxc5 ♕xc5 could be met by 9 ♕h6 ♕e5 10 ♕h7+ ♔f8 11 ♕h8+ ♕xh8 12 ♖xh8+ ♔g7 13 ♖a8 and ♖xa7. Without a passed a-pawn, Black is no better than White. Black found the superior 6 ... ♕e5 which favors him in all lines. For example, 7 ♕xc3 ♕xc3 8 bxc3 ♗c4 and ... a5. Or 7 bxc3 ♗c4 8 ♖f4 ♘c5! and, as the game went, 8 ♕h6 ♘f8 9 ♖g4 a5! 10 ♖g5 ♕xc3 11 e5 ♕xc2 (threat of ... ♗f1) 12 ♔h1 ♕b1+ 13 ♔h2 ♕b2 14 ♔h1 dxe5, when the a-pawn won. Trends can be broken by surprise sacrifices - or just by creating a material imbalance, as in this case: Black is in trouble because a move of the attacked knight allows ♖xf7+. Even on 1 ... ♘xg4 White can pass up 2 ♖xg4 in favor of 2 ♖xf7+ ♖xf7 3 ♕xf7+ ♔h6 (forced). After 4 ♕f8+ ♔h5 5 ♘e4 his pieces swarm for the kill. Black's simple choice in the diagram was resignation or desperation. He chose the latter, 1 ... ♗xg4!?. It shouldn't work because White can move his queen, leaving the threat of ♖xf6 on the table. For example, 2 ♕h1! ♘h5? 3 ♖xg4 is quite lost. Better is 2 ... ♗f5. But 3 ♗xf5 gxf5 4 ♕g1+ ♘g4 5 ♔b1! threatens to win with 6 ♖xf5 now that ... ♕e3 isn't a check. If Black had inserted the check, 3 ... ♕e3+ 4 ♔b1 gxf5, White should win after 5 ♖xf5 ♘e8 6 ♘e4. However, White thought that 2 ♖xg4? ♘xg4 3 ♕xg4 was a winner. (Some computers agree.) What White didn't appreciate is that without his initiative, the nature of the middlegame has turned against him. Play went 3 ... ♖bd8 4 ♕f3 ♖d6 5 ♘e4 ♖b6 6 c3. Now 6 ... f5! would eliminate attacks on f7 and limit White's minor pieces. Black actually went pawn grabbing, 6 ... ♕h2 7 ♗c2 ♕xh4 and gave White chances of salvation after 8 ♖h1 ♕d8 9 ♕e3 h5 10 ♖d1 ♕c7 11 ♕d4+. (But Black won eventually.) Desperation, the Weapon A bad position can be easier to play because it allows you to consider desperate steps you might have rejected in a less-lost position. Belyavsky - Kasparov, Moscow 1981
1 d4 ♘f6 2 c4 g6 3 ♘c3 ♗g7 4 e4 d6 5 f3 O-O 6 ♗e3 ♘c6 7 ♕d2 a6 8 ♘ge2 ♖e8? 9
♘c1 e5 10 d5 ♘d4 11 ♘1e2! c5 12 dxc6 ♘xc6 13 ♘d5! White threatens ♗b6! followed by ♘c7, winning the Exchange. Garry Kasparov set a personal record here by thinking for 68 minutes. He needed that much time to convince himself that passive defense, such as 13 ... ♘d7 14 h4! or 13 ... ♘xd5 14 cxd5 ♘e7 15 ♘c3, would ultimately lose. That helped narrow his options: Kasparov realized he had to allow ♗b6. Better to go down fighting in a sharp position than to be slowly ground down in a helpless one. With that (proper) attitude, he went for 13 ... b5 14 ♗b6 ♕d7 15 ♘c7 ♖b8 16 ♘xe8 ♕xe8. It was White's turn to sink into thought. He didn't like the looks of 17 ♗c7 ♖b7 18 ♗xd6 bxc4 or 17 cxb5 ♖xb6 18 bxc6 d5!?. In hopes of reducing risk, he gave back a pawn 17 ♗e3? bxc4 18 ♘c3 ♗e6 19 ♗e2. But Black had sufficient play after 19 ... ♘d4 20 O-O d5 and eventually won. Another example: Anand - Belyavsky, Belgrade 1997
1 e4 d6 2 d4 ♘f6 3 ♘c3 g6 4 ♗e3 e5 5 f3 exd4? 6 ♕xd4! ♗g7 7 O-O-O O-O 8 ♕d2
♗e6 9 ♗h6! ♗xh6 10 ♕xh6 ♘bd7 11 g4 ♕e7 12 h4! ♘e5 13 ♗e2 c6 14 ♘h3 ♖ad8 15 h5 ♖fe8 16 ♘f4 White's last move advertises his knockout ideas: g4-g5 and/or hxg6. Black chose what he called "the last chance in a hopeless position" - 16 ... ♘fxg4!?! and 17 fxg4 g5!. And he used his acting skills: He looked at his opponent in a confident manner. It was more than a bluff. There are ways that White's queen, which has no safe moves, can be caught, such as 18 ♘h3 f6 19 ♘f2?? (to stop ... ♘xg4) ♘f7!. Nevertheless White had an extra piece in a winning position. The future world champion became nervous. Instead of 18 ♘d3! he chose 18 ♘xe6? fxe6 and then 19 ♖df1 ♖f8 20 ♘d1. White felt he had a simple way of sealing matters, ♘e3-c4! followed by trading knights and then all four rooks. He can meet 20 ... ♘f7 with 21 ♕f6. He didn't believe Black had a useful move - until he saw 20... ♖f7!!. Suddenly the queen-trapping idea was alive, e.g. 21 ♖xf7?? ♘xf7 or 21 ♘e3 ♖df8 followed by taking (twice) on f1 and ... ♘f7. After long thought, White conceded material 21 ♗c4 ♖xf1+ 22 ♖xf1 ♘xc4 and drew after 23 ♖f6 ♕g7 24 ♕xg7+ ♔xg7 25 ♖xe6. As Anand himself later said, when he escaped from a lost position against Anatoly Karpov, "Once you understand you are lost, you can do anything," So far we've considered proper attitudes for the defender as well as a few principles to guide him. What else can he rely on? Calculate, Calculate A common misconception is that attackers calculate while defenders do ... something else. Actually, an attacker can choose many of his moves based on intuition and general principles. Or, he can look just two or three moves into the future. If he misses something tactical by his opponent, it usually costs him nothing more than the initiative. Not so for a defender. Anand - Tiviakov, Wijk aan Zee 2006
1 e4 d5 2 exd5 ♕xd5 3 ♘c3 ♕d6 4 d4 ♘f6 5 ♘f3 c6 6 ♘e5 ♘bd7 7 ♗f4 ♘d5 8
♘xd5 ♕xd5 9 ♗e2!? ♘xe5 10 ♗xe5 ♕xg2! 11 ♗f3 ♕g6 12 d5 A pawn down, White seems to have a powerful initiative, e.g. 12 ... cxd5 13 ♕xd5 e6? 13 ♕b5+. Black was forced to calculate and found 12 ... ♗g4!. He would have the strong 13 ♗xg4 ♕e4+!. White had missed 12 ... ♗g4. But he didn't lose his head. He played 13 dxc6 bxc6 14 ♕e2 ♗xf3 15 ♕xf3 ♖d8 16 ♖d1 and built enough play to draw. Because the defender is typically at greater risk of losing, he must calculate more than the attacker. He can't stop at two moves into the future if there's a good chance that disaster awaits him at move three. The cost of an oversight is greater for him. Yusupov - A. Sokolov, Riga 1986
1 d4 ♘f6 2 c4 e6 3 ♘f3 b6 4 g3 ♗a6 5 b3 ♗b4+ 6 ♗d2 ♗e7 7 ♗g2 d5 8 ♘e5 ♗b7 9
O-O ♘bd7 10 ♘c3 c5 11 ♗f4 O-O 12 cxd5 ♘xe5 13 ♗xe5 ♘xd5 14 ♘xd5 ♗xd5 15 e4 ♗b7 16 ♕g4! White threatens 17 ♕xg7 mate. Black can readily see that he has five ways to meet it. But one of them, 16 ... g5, is so weakening that he can push it down to the bottom of his mental list. At the top of the list is 16 ... ♗f6, because it offers a trade of bishops and, in most positions, exchanges tend to favor a defender. In between these two alternatives are the other candidate moves that meet the ♕xg7 mate threat: 16 ... g6, 16 ... ♗g5 and 16 ... f6. As he takes a more serious look at the position, Black can see that 16 ... ♗f6 17 ♗xf6 and 18 dxc5 would isolate a potentially weak pawn at c5. White can play for more with 17 ♖fd1. Then 17 ... cxd4 18 ♖xd4 ♕e7 looks adequate. But a defender has to look further. Black would see that 19 ♖d7! wins (19 ... ♕xd7 20 ♗xf6 g6 21 ♕g5 and ♕h6-g7 mate). What about 17 ... ♗xe5 18 dxe5 ♕c7 instead? If Black looks further he'll see that 19 ♖d6! is another substantial positional plus for White. So he looked for other alternatives. Black can see that after 16 ... g6 or 16 ... ♗g5 White could keep a significant edge with the simple 17 ♖fd1, if there's not something sharper. Realizing that he must calculate more than White, Black looked at the unlikely 16 ... f6!? and then 17 ♕xe6+ ♔h8. Hmm, this is better than it seemed at first, he might say to himself. The White bishop must move because the combination 18 dxc5 fxe5! 19 ♖ad1 ♕e8 20 ♖d7 fails to 20 ... ♗c8!. So Black must evaluate 18 ♗f4 cxd4. At first glance, that looks risky because the pawn at d4 appears weak. But after ... ♗c5 the pawn is supported, while the e4 pawn would be threatened by with ... ♖e8. In the end, Black chose 16 ... f6! 17 ♕xe6+ ♔h8 18 ♗f4 cxd4. White had nothing better than 19 ♖fc1 ♗c5 and then 20 b4! ♗xb4 21 ♖c7. Black shot back 21 ... ♗c8 22 ♕c6 ♗g4 and coasted to a quick draw (23 h3 ♗e2! 24 ♕b7 ♖b8 25 ♕xa7 ♖a8 26 ♕b7 ♖b8 27 ♕a7 ♖a8). Coolness under Fire The good defender knows that he is going to be surprised from time to time. He cannot expect to see all of his opponents' moves in advance. Shock happens. With that attitude, he can prepare himself emotionally. What he must avoid is not so much surprise as being rattled by surprise. White found 1 ♘f6!. Taking the knight, 1 ... gxf6 2 ♗xh6, leads to mate and 1 ... ♘xf6 2 exf6 would expose both Black's king (3 ♗xh6) and queen (♗xc7) to deadly threats. White wasn't counting on those lines. His basic idea was to trade off the best defender of the kingside with ♘xg8!. Even if Black had not expected 1 ♘f6! he should take it in his stride and look for a saving resource. The one he found was 1 ... c4!, to eliminate one of the minor pieces essential to White's attack. There followed 2 ♘xg8 ♔xg8. Since 3 ♗e4 ♗b7 only helps Black, White searched for a killer and spotted 3 ♗xh6. Black faces new dangers because 3 ... cxd3? loses to 4 ♗xg7! ♔xg7 5 ♕g4+ and ♖f3-h3 mate. White also threatens 4 ♕g3 g6 5 ♗xg6!. But once again a good defender would just take a deep breath and look for a saving grace. It may not exist. But if you don't look, you won't find. What Black found was 3 ... gxh6! 4 ♕xh6 cxd3. Or rather, he found that the apparent killer, 5 ♖f3 and 6 ♖g3+ is refuted by 5 ... ♕xe5! 6 ♖g3+ ♕xg3. Black would have more than enough compensation for the queen. White played 5 ♖f4! but Black anticipated ♖g4+ with 5 ... ♖b4!. The game ended in perpetual check, 6 ♖xb4 ♗xb4 7 ♕g5+ ♔h7 8 ♕h4+ ♔g7. In double-edged positions the player with the stronger nerves is playing with an extra piece. We see the attack succeed so often that we can come to the mistaken conclusion that only the defender's nerves can fail. Radulov - R. Byrne, Leningrad 1973

Boldness came with the price: a mangled king position. To play this way required nerves - and seeing that the dangerous-looking 17 ♘e5 fails to 17 ... fxe5 18 ♕g4+ ♔h8 19 ♕h4 ♖g8! and the king escapes. And what about White? He also has to meet threats, such as 17 ... c3!, which threatens his queen and prepares 18 ... cxb2. White tried 17 ♘d4 to get his queen to the kingside quickly. Black calmly replied 17 ... ♖fd8! and there followed 18 ♕g4+ ♔f8 19 ♕h4 c5!. "If Radulov had shown the cold-bloodedness of his opponent," the tournament book said, "he would have played 20 ♘f3!." For example, 20 ... ♔e7 21 ♘e5! ♖xd1+ 22 ♖xd1 ♖d8 23 ♖xd8 with good chances, it added. But if Black's nerves remained strong, he would have met 20 ♘f3 with 20 ... ♕xb2! and challenged White to play 21 ♕xh7 c3 or 21 ♖db1 ♕c2 22 ♕xf6 ♕f5!, for example. Instead, White misfired with 20 ♘f5? exf5 21 ♕xh7, expecting to win with ♖e1 and ♕h8 mate. Black had calculated further - because he knew he had to. He found 21 ... ♗c8! 22 ♖e1 ♗e6!, and won in a few moves. And most of all, a good defender never resigns until he has considered virtually every legal move in his search for a saving resource.

♗b7 9 ♗d3 ♗e4 Black's last move was based on 10 ♗xe4 ♕h4+ and 11 ... ♕xe4. But she overlooked 10 ♗g5. Black appears to be losing a piece since ... ♕h4+ is ruled out and 11 ♗xe4 is coming. She played her worst possible move: 10 ... resigns??. There were two improvements. One was 10 ... ♗e7 so that 11 ♗xe7? ♕xe7 12 ♗xe4 ♕h4+ or 11 ♗xe4 ♗xg5 12 ♕c3 c6 13 ♗xc6+ ♘xc6 14 ♕xc6+ ♔f8 and Black can play on. But she had much better: 10 ... ♗b4! and then 11 ♗xd8 ♗xd2+ or 11 ♕xb4 ♕xg5 or 11 c3 ♕d5 (12 cxb4 ♗xg2) would have given her a fine game. The Limits of Attack One of the reassuring facts of middlegame play is that some attacks run out of steam. If the defender meets all the threats - and the attacker cannot add additional pieces - his initiative will die. White has just advanced his rook from d1 and hopes to bring it to good use on c3 or f3. Black could test him with 1 ... ♕c2 and then 2 ♖c3 ♕xa2. But White would justify his loss of the pawn with the combination 3 ♖c8 ♖xc8 4 ♘xe7+ ♔f8 5 ♘xc8. Then 5 ... ♕xb3 6 ♘xh7+! is messy. Black chose the more circumspect 1 ... ♕b7!. White had a problem because 2 ♖c3 fails to 2 ... ♘xd5 3 exd5? ♗xc3 and 3 ♗xg7 h5! favors Black. But the key to the position is that after 2 ♖f3 all of White's pieces are attacking the kingside - yet there is no threat or way to make progress. If it were his move, 3 ♗xg7 ♔xg7 4 ♘xf6 ♘xf6 achieves nothing because 5 ♖xf6? exf6 6 ♕xh7+ ♔f8 ends the attack. That's comforting for Black. He played for a win with 2 ... ♗h8!. Now ♗xg7 is ruled out. White has reached the end of his kingside buildup and must defend against threats such as 3 ... ♘e5 followed by 4 ... ♘xf3 or 4 ... ♘xd5. White didn't like the looks of 3 ♘xf6+ exf6! or 3 ♖d3 ♘c5!. So he played a move that only looks like it attacks, 3 g4?. His position fell apart after 3 ... ♘xe4!. For example, 4 ♘xe4 ♕xd5 or 4 ♘xe7+ ♖xe7 5 ♘xf7 ♗f6!. Masters often take what seems to be considerable risk because they can accurately evaluate the limits of an enemy attack. We'll examine risk further in Chapter Six. But for the time being let's see how a player can allow his kingside to be damaged - because he knows he can't be mated by a lone enemy piece. Carlsen - Kramnik, Dortmund 2009
1 d4 ♘f6 2 c4 e6 3 ♘c3 ♗b4 4 ♕c2 O-O 5 a3 ♗xc3+ 6 ♕xc3 d5 7 ♘f3 dxc4 8 ♕xc4
b6 9 ♗g5 ♗a6 10 ♕a4 Black is a bit constricted and his c7-pawn is a potential target. With 10 ... ♕d7 11 ♕c2!, preparing ♗xf6 or ♖c1, his troubles would remain. The thematic way to handle the position is 10 ... c5. But Black has to carefully weigh the consequences of 11 dxc5 bxc5 and 12 ♖d1. Then 12 ... ♘bd7? 13 ♕xa6 is out of the question and 12 ... ♕e8 is uncomfortable after 13 ♕xe8 ♖xe8 14 ♗xf6 gxf6 15 e3. And 12 ... ♕b6 allows doubled kingside pawns, 13 ♗xf6 gxf6. All true. But in the last line, Black threatens ... ♕xb2, e.g. 14 ♕g4+ ♔h8 15 ♕h4 ♕xb2!. Black liked what he saw and went into this. White had no good means of sacrificing the b-pawn, so 14 ♖d2 and then 14 ... ♘c6 were played. Black's kingside remains weakened. But White only has one piece to attack it with, e.g. 15 ♕g4+ ♔h8 16 ♕h4 ♔g7 17 ♘g5 fxg5 18 ♕xg5+ ♔h8 19 ♕f6+ ♔g8 is only a perpetual check. Since "a weakness is not a weakness ..." White took the draw with 17 ♕g4+ ♔h8 18 ♕h4 ♔g7 19 ♕g4+. Easier to Play Most players love to attack. If they had a choice, perhaps only one out of ten would say they prefer to defend. Why? Because it is fun to win with sacrifices, checks and mating nets. And because the attacker usually has an easier time finding good moves. But this is not always the case. Sometimes the defender has an easier task because his moves are forced or severely limited: He can rely on the process of elimination. Anything other than what he chooses would lose. It is the attacker who may face more difficult choices. White sacrificed two pawns to exploit Black's insecure king. (Black had previously played ... ♔e8-d8-e8 so he can't castle now.) White has a wide variety of discovered checks but they lack a strong follow-up. For example, 1 ♗c7+ may force 1 ... ♗e6. Then 2 f5 ♘xc7 3 fxe6 looks good - until you see 3 ... ♘d5!, when Black weathers the storm. e.g. 4 ♘b7 a5! 5 ♘d6+ ♔e7 6 exf7+ ♔xd6 7 fxg8(♕) ♖xg8 and the queenside pawns are strong. White found the inspired 1 c4! with the idea of 1 ... bxc4 2 ♖b1 or 2 ♗c3+. On 1 ... ♗xd1 he would continue 2 cxd5 because 2 ... ♗xc2?? 3 ♗c7+! ♔f8 4 ♗d6 is mate and 2 ... f6 3 ♗d6+ ♔f7 4 ♖xd1 is double-edged. But Black also found a great move, 1 ... f6!. His king now had an escape square at f7. The pressure is back on White. He had a difficult choice: 2 ♖b1 would be consistent but 2 cxd5 seems to win material. After 2 cxd5 ♗xd1 the 3 ♗c7+ idea is stronger than before and leads to 3 ... ♔f7 4 ♖xd1 cxd5 5 ♖xd5. White may have rejected that because at the end, 5 ... a5! favors Black a bit. He chose 2 ♖b1 instead, hoping for 2 ... fxe5 3 cxd5 or 2 ... bxc4 3 ♗xf6+ ♔f7 4 ♗e5 and ♖b7+. All of this was difficult for White to find. But it was relatively easy for Black to find the best move, 2 ... ♘b6!, since it closes the dangerous b-file. White could get one pawn back, 3 ♗d4+ ♔f7 4 cxb5 cxb5 5 ♖xb5, but he would be worse. Instead, White played 3 ♗xf6+ ♔f7 4 ♗g5 and Black was on the road to victory with two extra queenside pawns and a safe king, 4 ... ♘xc4 5 ♖e7+ ♔g6. White was able to delay matters with a few threats but he lost soon after 6 ♖be1 ♗f5 7 ♔f2 ♖ad8 8 ♘d3 a5 9 ♖g1 ♖d7! 10 ♗h4+ ♔h7. The two types of position - the ones in which it's easier to conduct the attack and the others when it's easier to defend - may occur at different times in the same game: Stein - Flohr, Kiev 1957
1 e4 c6 2 d4 d5 3 ♘c3 dxe4 4 ♘xe4 ♘d7 5 ♗c4 ♘gf6 6 ♘g5 e6 7 ♕e2 ♕e7? 8 ♗d2
b6 9 O-O-O ♗b7 10 ♘1f3 h6 11 ♗b4! A rude shock for Black. He realized that 11 ... ♕xb4 makes 12 ♘xf7! strong. For example, 12 ... ♔xf7 13 ♕xe6+ ♔g6 14 ♗d3+ and mates. Or 12 ... ♖h7 13 ♕xe6+ ♗e7 14 ♖he1. What made this difficult for Black was not only finding those losing lines but choosing between the more playable 11 ... ♕xb4 12 ♘xf7 ♕xc4!? and the move he adopted in the game, 11 ... c5. White replied 12 dxc5 bxc5 13 ♗xc5!? ♘xc5 14 ♘e5! with a check coming up on b5. Yes, it took a bit of calculation to convince himself that 13 ♗xc5 might work. But so far it's been easier for White to find good moves than for Black to defend. Black found a way to avoid a quick loss: 14 ... ♘fd7 15 ♘gxf7 ♘xe5 16 ♘xe5 ♕g5+ and then 17 f4! ♕xf4+ 18 ♔b1 ♗e4!. White is still a piece down. He needed sharp moves and looked for checks, captures and other forcing moves. The game went 19 ♕h5+ g6 20 ♗b5+ ♔e7 21 ♘xg6+ ♗xg6 22 ♕xc5+ ♔f7 23 ♕c6. Only his last move and the dead end of 22 ♕xg6+? ♕g5! might be hard to calculate. This looked like a winning position because 24 ♖hf1 and 24 ♕xa8 are threatened. But a subtle change has occurred. Positions like this are easier for Black to play than earlier ones in this game because there is only one move to meet both threats, 23 ... ♕e4!. White had more shots to come: 24 ♕d7+ ♔g8 25 ♗d3 ♕g4 26 h3 ♕g5. The turning point of the game was 27 ♕xe6+?. The quieter 27 ♖hf1! might have won (27 ... ♖h7 28 ♕xe6+ or 27 ... ♗g7 28 ♕xe6+ ♔h7 29 h4). Black replied 27 ... ♗f7 28 ♕c6 ♖b8 29 ♕c7 ♖b6. It was harder and harder for White to find good-looking moves. Instead of 30 ♖hf1! he chose 30 ♗c4?. Black consolidated with virtually forced defensive moves, 30 ... ♖h7 31 ♖hf1 ♖f6! 32 ♖xf6 ♕xf6. In the end, White blundered with 33 ♖f1? ♕xf1+ and resigned when he saw that 34 ♗xf1 ♗xa2+ and ... ♖xc7 wins for Black. Quiz Good attitudes and spirit, backed by a few basic guidelines, are the foundation of successful defense. Let's see if you can apply them in these quiz positions. Take at least five minutes to study each diagram and try to find the answer. The solutions for this chapter and for the quizzes in later chapters can be found at the end of the book. Black's immediate threat of ... ♗xc5, winning back a pawn, would leave White with the better game positionally. Does Black have a greater threat brewing on the kingside? And how can White deal with it? White threatens ♕xg7. What is the best of Black's options? Four attacking pieces seem too many for Black to handle in lines such as 1 ... ♕xd5 2 ♖xg7+ ♔h8 3 ♘f6!. What can Black do? White threatens the pinned knight. How should Black respond? White played 1 ♗xg5. Analyze the consequences. White has just played 1 ♗d4 and clearly intends 2 g5 followed by a trade of bishops. What's best for Black? Chapter Three: New Defense You know how opening theory churns constantly. But you may not appreciate that middlegame theory changes, too, and no more so than in defense. The story of the evolution of defense begins with Wilhelm Steinitz. Steinitz was the first great player to make the transition from a young attacking player to a mature defensive master, who asked himself what made an attack succeed. It couldn't just be the genius of the player marshaling the attack, he concluded. Or the lack of skill of the defender. Some great attackers fail to beat weaker players and some weaker players mate great opponents. Steinitz reasoned that one of the players must have some form of superiority in the position before he could begin a successful initiative. For example, if he can deliver superior force at the point of the attack - that is, at a target - his attack will work. But if you realize there is no such advantage, the attack can be refuted. Steinitz's opponent controls a bit more space. But that is not enough to justify the bid for mate White began with 1 ♖e3?. Steinitz felt that the attack should fail. He countered with 1 ... ♕d6, attacking the most vulnerable White weakness, the d4-pawn. He saw that he could meet 2 ♖h3 with 2 ... h6 and push White back after 3 ♖d1 f6!. White chose 2 ♖d1 but 2 ... f6! again exposed the flaw in his optimism. If the attacked knight retreats to f3, Black would seize the initiative with 3 ... ♕a6! (4 ♘d2 e5). White continued with his anti-h7 plan, 3 ♖h3. Black had a major choice. He could take the knight, 3 ... fxe5 4 ♕xh7+ ♔f8. But White's initiative is not easily halted after 5 ♖f3+ ♗f7 6 ♕h8+ ♔e7 7 ♕xg7 ♖f8 8 ♖b1. Or 5 ♖g3 ♗f7 6 ♖xg7 ♖c7 7 c5. Steinitz opted for the low-risk approach, 3 ... h6!. This transposes into the position he considered after 2 ♖h3 h6 3 ♖d1 f6 and gives him excellent winning chances with little risk of losing. White saw that 4 ♘g6 fails to 4 ... ♗xg6 5 ♕xg6 ♖xc4 and then 6 ♖xh6 ♕xd4!, e.g. 7 ♖xd4?? ♖c1+ or 7 ♕h7+ ♔f8 8 ♕h8+ ♔f7 9 ♕xd8 ♕xd8. Instead he played 4 ♘g4. But his pieces were not coordinated well and Black was able to confuse them further with 4 ... ♕f4! 5 ♘e3 ♗a4 6 ♖f3 ♕d6 7 ♖d2 ♗c6 8 ♖g3 f5! 9 ♖g6 ♗e4 10 ♕b3 ♔h7. Black pieces then ran all over the board: 11 c5 ♖xc5 12 ♖xe6 ♖c1+ 13 ♘d1 ♕f4 14 ♕b2 ♖b1 15 ♕c3 ♖c8 16 ♖xe4 ♕xe4 and White resigned. But Steinitz was much too rigid. He often accepted sacrifices on principle and grossly underestimated his opponent's potential pressure. White wants to develop his bishop but 1 ♗e3? ♕xb2 just drops a pawn. He chose 1 ♗g5, perhaps counting on 1 ... ♘e4, which attacks as well as defends. Then he could do the same with 2 ♗e3 and threaten ♕xd5 as well as ♗xb6. But Steinitz felt confident in his king's ability to defend itself and met 1 ♗g5 with 1 ... ♕xb2?!. He likely concluded that he would have winning chances after 2 ♗xf6 ♕xf6 3 ♕xd5 and 3 ... ♖d8. More problematic is 2 ♖e2!. Then 2 ... ♕c3 3 ♖e3 ♕b2 allows 4 ♖b3 ♕xa2 5 ♗xf6 gxf6 6 ♖xb7 when White's chances are no worse than Black's. So instead of 2 ... ♕c3 the game went 2 ... ♕b5 3 ♗xf6 gxf6 4 ♖d2 ♖d8. A modern master would appreciate, as Steinitz did, that Black's kingside is hard to exploit. But he would also know what Steinitz discounted, that a slow buildup, say with 5 ♘d4 ♘xd4 6 ♖xd4, would give White excellent practical chances - especially because it is easier to play White than Black. Steinitz was vindicated after White went for direct mate, 5 ♘h4? d4! 6 ♖d3? ♘e5 7 ♖b3 ♕c6 8 ♖g3+ ♔f8 9 ♕d2?, and was lost after 9 ... ♖c8! 10 ♕h6+ ♔e7 11 ♘f5+ ♔d7. Steinitz's Heirs Steinitz's successors refined his approach. For Siegbert Tarrasch, piece activity and mobility were very high priorities when attacking, maneuvering positionally or defending. Tarrasch was willing to accept a sacrifice - but not if it meant accepting a passive position. When defending, his goal was to get his pieces quickly into play. He assumed that they would then be able to meet threats and, eventually, seize the initiative. White's compensation for a sacrificed piece lies in two strong center pawns, his fine bishop and the pawn at h5, which prevents ... ♘g6 and makes doubling rooks on the g-file a long-term threat. Tarrasch's characteristically active defense began with 1 ... ♖ad8!, intending ... ♘c5 and ... ♘xb3!. After 2 ♕e3 he still played 2 ... ♘c5 because the pinning 3 ... ♗d4 was threatened. Play went 3 c3 ♘xb3 4 axb3 a6 5 ♖h2. The instinctive response to White's plan of ♔h1/♖g1/♖hg2 would be 5 ... ♔h8. But Tarrasch continued to seek play for his under-used pieces with 5 ... ♖fe8!. The point of this wasn't clear until 6 ♘e2 ♘d5 7 ♕f2: With 7 ... ♘c7! 8 ♘g3 ♘e6 the knight is headed to the great blockade square at g5 and threatened 9 ... ♘xd4! along the way. Play went 9 ♘f5 ♘g5 10 ♔h1 ♔h8 11 ♖g2 ♗f6 12 ♘e3. White was preparing 13 e5 followed by f3-f4. Tarrasch foiled that by reorganizing his minor pieces, 12 ... ♘e6! and 13 ... ♗g5. On 13 d5 cxd5 14 ♘xd5 he intended to seize the initiative with 14 ... ♖xd5! 15 exd5 ♘f4 and ... ♕f5. White played 13 ♖g4 and still had powerful compensation after 13 ... ♗g5 14 ♘f5 ♖g8 15 f4 ♗f6. Even after a trade of all four rooks, 16 ♖ag1 ♖xg4 17 ♖xg4 ♖g8 18 ♖xg8+ ♕xg8 19 ♕f3, he would have had good chances. But White preferred 15 ♕h2 with the idea of ♕e5+. Play continued 15 ... ♗f6 16 ♖ag1 ♖g5!. The rook is the third defensive piece to occupy the g5 stronghold. Now an ♖xg5/... hxg5 exchange would render the g-file harmless and allow ... ♘f4!. White's last bullet was 17 f4 and it gives Black a chance to give up material for the initiative: 17 ... ♖xf5! 18 exf5 ♕xf5 19 ♖1g2 ♘g7. After a repetition of moves, 20 ♖4g3 ♕b1+ 21 ♖g1 ♕e4+ 22 ♖1g2 ♕b1+ 23 ♖g1 ♕e4+, he was ready for 24 ♖1g2 ♘f5 and ... ♘e3. Instead, White played 24 ♖3g2 and resigned soon after 24 ... ♖d5 25 f5 ♖xf5 26 ♕b8+ ♔h7. While mobility was Tarrasch's goal in all middlegames, Emanuel Lasker's emphasis was more practical. Chess is a struggle, Lasker said, and the defender had as much right to win the struggle as his opponent. Lasker Defends to Win No matter how bad a position is, Lasker felt, the defender should try to find a way to make threats. He should hold out hope of winning, not just surviving. Here is Lasker, lost after a dozen moves as White, in a world championship match: Lasker - Janowsky, Berlin 1910
1 d4 d5 2 c4 e6 3 ♘c3 c5 4 cxd5 exd5 5 ♘f3 ♗e6 6 e4? dxe4 7 ♘xe4 ♘c6! 8 ♗e3
cxd4 9 ♘xd4? ♕a5+! 10 ♘c3 O-O-O 11 a3 ♘h6 12 b4 ♕e5 White faces disaster on the d-file where his knight is pinned (13 ♘xc6 ♖xd1 with check) and threatened by 13 ... ♘xd4 and 13 ... ♘f5. If Steinitz were sitting in White's chair he would have chosen 13 ♘ce2. But Lasker hated to play purely passive moves. White may be alive after 13 ♘ce2 ♘f5 14 ♖c1 but it's just barely that following 14 ... ♘xe3 15 fxe3 ♕xe3. He would be a pawn down and several moves away from castling. Lasker chose the audacious 13 ♘cb5!. Objectively it is inferior to 13 ♘ce2 but it adds a powerful, new element. After 14 ♖c1 White will begin to make threats of his own, such as ♘xa7+. On 13 ... a6 White also has 14 ♕c1! with the idea of 14 ... axb5 15 ♘xc6 bxc6 16 ♕xc6+ ♕c7 17 ♕a6+ and 18 ♖c1(+). Play went 13 ... ♘f5 14 ♖c1!. White is beginning to coordinate his pieces (15 ♖c3). There are immense complications after 14 ... ♖xd4 15 ♘xd4 ♘xe3 but White emerges on top. Play went 14 ... ♘xe3! 15 fxe3 ♕xe3+ 16 ♗e2. Black seemed ready to deliver a knockout with 16 ... ♗b3 since 17 ♕xb3? ♕xc1+ and 17 ♕d2 ♕xd2+ 18 ♔xd2 ♔b8! win. But there was another point to White's aggressive 13th move. He can answer 16 ... ♗b3? with 17 ♘xa7+! ♔c7 18 ♘db5+! since 18 ... ♔b6 allows 19 ♕xd8+! ♘xd8 20 ♘c8+ and mates. Black found the best move, 16 ... ♗e7!. This tempts White to try 17 ♘xa7+ ♔b8! 18 ♘axc6+ bxc6 19 ♘xc6+ ♔b7. Black would win after 20 ♘xd8+ ♖xd8 21 ♕c2 ♖c8 but the immediate 20 ♕c2! would have left chances unclear. Lasker went with the common-sense move, 17 ♖c3. He wanted to drive the Black queen back and make ♘xa7+ more dangerous. It also prepares to get out of the d-file pin with 18 ♖d3. A third benefit of 17 ♖c3 is that it offers Black a variety of unclear variations to calculate and evaluate, such as 17 ... ♕xc3+!? 18 ♘xc3 ♘xd4 and 18 ... ♗f6. In the end Black chose 17 ... ♗h4+ 18 g3 ♕e4? 19 O-O! ♗f6 and White took over the initiative with 20 ♖xf6! gxf6 21 ♗f3. White won swiftly after 21 ... ♕e5? (21 ... ♖xd4 lasts longer) 22 ♘xa7+ ♔c7 23 ♘axc6 bxc6 24 ♖xc6+. Origins of New Defense By the late 20th century, traditional defensive principles were being overthrown. Consider this position, from a Caro-Kann Defense variation we'll be examining later. Traditional defense thinking held that ... h6 had compromised Black's kingside so much that he doesn't dare castle there. He usually played 1 ... O-O-O even though it was clear that he would be worse after 2 ♗a6! because he would have virtually no counterplay. Conventional wisdom said what mattered most was that Black had few weaknesses. Play often went 2 ... ♗xa6 3 ♕xa6+ ♔b8 with a solid, if unpromising position. Black can rarely afford ... c5 when he castles long like this. But Anatoly Karpov introduced 1 ... O-O! and that became a main line. Yes, White can open lines with 2 g4 and 3 g5. But Black's king position is more solid than was thought, and his counterplay from ... c5 is strong. Another illustration from a Caro-Kann: White has liquidated part of the center with f2-f4-f5xe6 but failed to expose a weakness. For example, 1 ♘f5 can be met by 1 ... cxd4, which prepares a strong 2 ... ♕d5. White rejected the equal and toothless 1 dxc5 ♗xc5 2 ♕xd8+ ♖xd8 3 ♘d3 and opted for 1 ♘xf7 ♔xf7 2 ♖xe6 ♔xe6 3 ♕g6! instead. Wasn't this a violation of Steinitz's law? Yes, there was no obvious White advantage that justified attack, let alone a piece sacrifice. But defenders who had relied on Steinitz's law had been mated over and over by more daring opponents in the last half of the 20th century. Black's king has been forced into the open and faces dangers after dxc5 and ♗f4/♘f5. It's tempting to play 3 ... cxd4 and try to escape with ... ♔d7. But 4 ♘f5 ♔d7 5 ♗f4 or 5 ♘xg7 (5 ... ♗xg7 6 ♕xg7+ ♕e7?! 7 ♗xh6) would give White dangerous compensation for his knight. Instead, Black chose 3 ... ♕d5 4 dxc5 ♕xa2!. The threat of ... ♕a1 mate prevents White from a slow buildup of his forces. After 5 ♖e1+ ♔d7 6 ♕f5+ ♔d8 7 ♗c3 ♘bd5, for example, Black is remarkably safe. Instead, White tried 6 ♗c3 and Black replied 6 ... ♕a1+ 7 ♔d2 ♘c4+ 8 ♔e2 ��a6!. White has to meet 9 ... ♘e5+ and can't afford 9 ♔f2 ♗xc5+. Black's king proved to be relatively safe on c6 after play went 9 ♕f7+ ♔c6 10 ♔f3 ♗xc5. Then 11 ♕xg7 ♘d5 12 ♖e6+ ♘d6 would offer White little. He preferred 11 ♘f5 ♖f8. But neither 12 ♕xg7 ♔b5! 13 ♘d4+ ♗xd4 14 ♕xf8 ♕c6+ 15 ♔g3 ♗xc3 16 bxc3 ♘e4+ 17 ♔h2 ♕d6+ nor the game continuation, 12 ♘d4+ ♔b6 13 ♕e6+ ♗d6 14 ♘f5 ♖e8 could save him. Active defense trumped solid but passive defense. Myth of the 'Solid King Position' Another traditional defensive principle was: "There must be some weakness in the opponent's position" for an attack to succeed, as Tibor Florian wrote in Defense and Counterattack (1984). But well before that, masters began to suspect that even a solid king position could be breached if there are enough attacking pieces: Ragozin - Boleslavsky, Sverdlovsk 1942

♘f3 O-O 9 O-O ♗d6 10 ♖e1 ♗g4 11 ♕e4 ♗h5 12 ♘h4 ♘d7 13 ♕f5! ♘b6 14 ♕xh5 ♘xc4 Before this game, the chief drawback to 5 ... exf6 was believed to be that it gave White a queenside pawn majority. White should play to create a passed queenside pawn, opening theory said. But here White played 15 ♗h6! and the attack based on ♗xg7 and/or ♘f5 proved decisive. For example, 15 ... gxh6 16 b3 ♘b6 17 ♘f5 ♔h8 18 ♕xh6 ♖g8 and now 19 ♖e8! (19 ... ♕xe8 20 ♕xf6+ mates). The game went 15 ... ♕d7 16 ♗xg7! ♔xg7 17 ♘f5+ ♔h8 18 ♖e4! ♗xh2+ 19 ♔h1!. Black resigned because he had no defense to ♖h4/♕xh7 mate. Of course, you can call the doubled f-pawns a weakness. But since Black's f7, g7 and h7 pawns remained on their original squares, there were no holes and therefore his kingside should have been solid. It wasn't. Superior force - four White pieces - defeated Black's solid-but- passive defense setup. Dynamic Play vs. King Safety Another problem with solid-but-passive defense is this: If your pieces are well-placed for the protection of your weaknesses, they are probably incapable of exploiting your opponent's weaknesses. In the long run, if you can't make threats of your own, your opponent may be able to concentrate his forces at the weakest chain in your link of defense and win. Just protecting yourself doesn't always save games - and it rarely wins games. This is why New Defense places the highest priority on counterplay. In general, counterplay outranks pawn structure, development and even material. Only king safety rivals it - and doesn't necessarily exceed it - in importance. Duckstein - Petrosian, Varna 1962

But White's pieces remain a bit more active. He may obtain an initiative after ♖fe1, threatening ♗e5. Black chose the stunning 18 ... a5!. Yes, he invited the destruction of the pawn protection around his king. But Black can prevent a file from being opened, e.g. 19 bxa5 ♗xc5 20 a6 b6! 21 a5 b5!. In other words, Black is willing to trade some king safety for substantial piece play. White answered by seeking exchanges, 19 ♖ad1 ♖xd1 20 ♖xd1. But Black would have had an edge after 20 ... axb4!. However, he was so sure of his king that he tried the more ambitious 20 ... ♖h4?! 21 bxa5 ♗xc5. Then came 22 a6 b6! 23 ♖e1! ♔a7 24 ♗e5 ♕d7 25 ♘e4 ♗d4. White could have exploited this with 26 a5 so that 26 ... ♗xe5? 26 axb6+ and 27 ♘c5 is a strong attack. But he chose 26 g3? and invited a powerful sacrifice, 26 ... ♗xe5! 27 gxh4 ♘d4 28 ♕d1 ♕d5, that eventually won. Another illustration of balancing king safety and counterplay was: Short - Harikrishna, Gibraltar 2004
1 e4 e5 2 ♘f3 ♘c6 3 ♗b5 ♘f6 4 d3 ♗c5 5 O-O d6 6 ♘c3 ♗g4 7 ♘a4 ♘d7 8 ♘xc5
♘xc5 9 ♗e3 ♕f6 10 ♗xc6+! bxc6 11 ♗xc5 dxc5 12 ♕e2 White wants his queen on e3 where it will eye the c5-pawn and allow him to get out of the pin. Black shouldn't permit 13 ♕e3 and 14 ♘d2, so he chose 12 ... ��xf3. White replied 13 gxf3! rather than play an endgame (13 ♕xf3 ♕xf3 14 gxf3). He believed that his king would be safe at h1. This appeared so strong that Black didn't even try to test White with 13 ... g5 or 13 ... O-O 14 ♔h1 ♕d6 and ... f5. Instead, he preferred 13 ... O-O 14 ♔h1 ♖ad8. But after 15 ♖g1 it was easy to see that White could make progress with ♕e3, ♖g4, b2-b3, ♖ag1 and eventually f3-f4. Play went 15 ... ♕h6 16 ♕e3!. Black saw nothing better than 16 ... ♕xe3 17 fxe3, and White's 13 gxf3! had been vindicated. In the endgame the pawn structure is so lost for Black that he should have bid for counterplay with 17 ... c4! 18 dxc4 ♖d2. But he opted for 17 ... f5 18 exf5 ♖xf5 and was slowly ground down after 19 ♖af1 ♖b8 20 b3 ♖bf8 21 ♖g3. Geller's 'Clutching' Traditional defensive theory was created to meet the demands of traditional attacking theory. It said that a defender could expect his opponent to stay within certain reasonable, recognized limits. For example, a defender would not have to worry about an attacker offering purely speculative sacrifices. "To sacrifice a piece one should be absolutely sure that one will quickly gain compensation," Jose Capablanca wrote. But when Mikhail Tal began to win with outrageous sacrifices, he challenged traditional defense. Defenders needed a new approach. Yefim Geller, best known as an attacking player, offered this Laskerian advice: In a bad position, when there is no real counterplay, the defender should 'clutch' at enemy pieces and pawns. The idea is to inflict maximum annoyance until the opponent begins to err. Three pawns down, White is quite lost. Trying to construct a defensive wall to stop the extra enemy pawns from advancing is bound to fail. But White can 'clutch' and harass, 1 ♕f8+ ♔c7 2 ♕f4 ♖f7 3 ♕g5 ♕f5 4 ♕d2. This wasn't progress, of course. But the defender doesn't need progress. His opponent does. White kept finding annoying resources such as 5 ♕a5+, e.g. 5 ... ♔b8? 6 ♕d8+ ♔a7 7 e6!. After 4 ... ♖e7 5 ♕a5+ ♔c8 6 ♕c3 ♖e6 7 a4 ♕f2 8 ♖h1, annotator Mikhail Savinov said White was following the classic Geller recipe: attacking pawns, giving checks and sometimes defending his own material. Black found himself off-balance and blundered with 8 ... ♔d7?. That allowed White to regain one pawn with 9 ♕b4!. He was still lost. But even though Black was not in time trouble, he soon fell apart: 9 ... b5 10 ♕xg4 ♕f7 11 ♕d4! ♔c8 12 ♕b6! ♕c7 13 ♕xa6+. He lost his queen and resigned after 13 ... ♕b7?? 14 ♖h8+ ♔c7 15 ♕a5+ ♕b6 16 ♖c8+!. And White went on to win the tournament with nearly a 2900 performance rating. This was an extreme example, of course. White had no right to even draw. Whenever a defender escapes from a bad position, the post-mortem is bound to reveal improvements for his opponent. But it is also likely to demonstrate the superiority of clutching over passive defense. White has a substantial positional edge which she can enlarge with ♘d4/f4-f5, or h4-h5xg6 or a well-prepared e4-e5. Traditional defensive theory held that Black could delay a crisis for many moves with solid play. New Defense argues that given time, White will win this kind of position nine times out of ten. That's why Black needed to activate his dormant pieces, particularly his g7- bishop. He began with 1 ... f5!, even though it invited 2 e5! and granted White a powerful passed e-pawn. The benefit of this was 2 ... ♕c4! because the d5-pawn had become a target. There followed 3 ♖ad1 ♗a4! 4 ♖d2. Black exposed e6 to an invasion from ♘g5-e6. But he moved the bishop from d7 because he needed another piece to clutch with. He continued with 4 ... ♗c2!. He wanted to plug the e-file with ... ♗e4 and didn't fear 5 ♖c1 b3 6 exd6 ♗xb2, for example. Post-mortem analysis showed that White missed a strong 5 ♘g5 (since 5 ... ♗e4 6 exd6! ♗xd5 7 ♖ed1 ♗c6 8 d7 would create a monster d-pawn). Clutching paid off after 5 h4 ♗e4! 6 ♖d4 ♕b3 7 ♘g5 ♕xb2 led to a liquidation and a draw (8 ♘xe4 fxe4 9 ♖dxe4 dxe5). Ugly Moves Attackers win with pretty moves, such as queen sacrifices. The defender has to overcome the feeling of awe that he can get when an attacker dazzles him with tactical explosions. White has the Exchange for two Pawns. But the pawns are passed and, what's worse, his bishop is trapped at f8. It will be lost after ... ♘d7 or ... ♘c6. White came up with an inspired combination beginning with 1 ♖xb5!. Of course, 1 ... ♕xb5?? allows mate on g7. Black took 1 ... ♗xb5. Then 2 ♖c8 ♕a1+ 3 ♖c1 would not lead to a repetition of moves (3 ... ♕e5?) but to a win (3 ... ♕d4! 4 ♖c8 ♕d1 mate). But White had another dazzler, 2 ♗g7!. White threatens 3 ♗xe5 as well as 3 ♖c8+. A pretty additional point is that 2 ... ♕e6?? loses to 3 ♗h8! and ♕g7 mate (or 3... ♔xh8 4 ♕f8 mate). But the game is not over. In such positions the defender must recover his composure and look for a resource. The only possibility is 2 ... f6 and it works because of 3 ♗h8 ♔f7! and 4 ♕xh7+ ♔e6! (not 4 ... ♔e8?? 5 ♕g8+ ♔d7 6 ♕c8+ ♔d6 7 ♖d1+) . Now it was White's turn to dodge a trap. After 5 ♕g8+ ♔d6 6 ♖d1+? ♔c7 Black is escaping. White had to settle for 6 ♕d8+! ♔e6 7 ♕g8+ ♔d6, draw. There are few defensive moves that could be called aesthetic. Instead of pretty moves, the careful defender - the New Defender - often has to rely on 'ugly moves,' that is, moves that don't look right. They seem to violate traditional defensive canon if not common sense. White has made substantial inroads on the queenside. Conventional strategy calls for him to castle followed by (a) going after the a5-pawn with ♗e1 and ♘b5/ ♘xa5, or (b) bringing heavy pieces to the b- and c-files and crashing through with c4-c5. But 1 O-O gives Black a target for ... ♘f6, ... ♘f7, ... h5 and ... g4!. White realized that his king would be safest on the side of the board where he is strongest. He played 1 ♔d2! and 1 ... ♗d7 2 ♔c2 ♘f7 3 c5!. Black didn't like allowing 4 c6 so the game continued 3 ... dxc5 4 ♘xc5 ♘d6 5 ♘xd7 ♕xd7 6 ♗b5 ♘xb5 7 axb5. Now the a5-pawn is all but lost because White can double rooks on the a-file. But it's the absence of Black counterplay - no target! - that cost him the game, 7 ... ♖fb8 8 ♕d3 ♗f8 9 ♕c4 ♕d6 10 ♖a4 ♘f6 11 ♖ha1. White won after 11 ... ♘d7 12 ♕c6! ♘b6 (or 12... ♕xc6 13 bxc6 ♗c5!? 14 cxd7 ♗xf2 15 ♖c4 ♗b6 16 ♘b5) 13 ♖xa5 ♖xa5 14 ♖xa5. Viktor Korchnoi was one of the fathers of New Defense. He popularized a confrontational style designed to throw an attacker off balance. He sought to deny opponents the opportunity to make aggressive moves with confidence. Here that doesn't seem possible. White has built up a nice positional edge and has 'easy' attacking moves, such as ♘e4-f6+ and ♖f1-f4-g4. Black would like to put his knight to better work, with ... g6 and ... ♘g7-f5. But that weakens both f6 and h6, e.g. 1 ... g6 2 ♕h6 ♘g7 3 ♖h3 ♘h5 4 ♖dd3, threatening 5 ♖xh5 gxh5 6 ♖g3+. Traditional defensive thinking said pawns around a castled king should not be moved (1 ... g6?). New Defense adds "... unless there is a very good reason." That explains Korchnoi's 1 ... h5!. It averted a rook lift to g4 and threatened to disrupt White's coordination with ... h4. After 2 ♖f1 ♕b4! 3 ♘e2 ♕c4! 4 c3 White counted on his attack growing with 4 ... ♕xa2 5 ♘f4. But 5 ... h4! keeps Black solid. He preferred to get his knight in the game, 4 ... g6! 5 ♖gf3 ♘g7. The knight will have a terrific defensive post at f5, from where it watches the key g3, e3 and d4 squares. Lacking a way to better use his rooks, White tried 6 b3 ♕a6! 7 ♘g3 and was met by 7 ... h4! 8 ♘e4 ♘f5. Now we see why the queen retreated to a6. White can't win with 9 ♖xf5 and 10 ♘f6+ because Black would be threatening ... ♕xf1+. White played 9 ♕f4, perhaps hoping for 9 ... ♘xd4? 10 cxd4 ♕xa2? 11 ♘f6+ and wins. But Black calmly played 9 ... ♕xa2!. The outcome was still unclear as play went 10 ♗c5 ♕e2 and White repeated moves, 11 ♖3f2 ♕d3 12 ♖f3 ♕e2 13 ♖3f2 ♕d3. Instead of taking the draw White chose 14 ♖d2?! and was surprised by 14 ... ♕xd2! 15 ♘xd2 ♗xc5. This changed the nature of the position. Material is roughly even. But Black owns the only open file and his knight is worth a rook. Moreover, White had no targets. It was harder for the (former) attacker to find easy moves. No wonder that after one more error, 16 ♘e4 ♗e3 17 ♘f6+ ♔g7 18 ♕c4 ♖7d8 19 ♘g4 ♗b6 20 ♘f2? ♗xf2 21 ♖xf2 ♘e3!, he had to resign. Quiz And now it's your turn to see how you can apply what the world has learned in more than a century of evolving defensive thinking. Once again the solutions can be found at the end of this book. White played 1 f4. How should Black react? White had sacrificed a piece on h6 in expectation of a knockout blow from ♖g4+. What can Black do? White has an annoying ♘f6+ coming up. Is there anything better than 1 ... O-O or 1 ... f5 ? A natural move is 1 ... e6. What else should Black consider? Chapter Four: Weapons of Defense The weapons of attack, such as the sacrifice and the line-opening pawn break, are well known. Every how-to-play primer introduces at least a few of them. The weapons of defense, however, have suffered a bad press. They're not well known. Let's change that by examining these weapons: (1) Closing/controlling attacking lines (2) Dead Pawn (3) Repairing weaknesses (4) Trading into the endgame (5) Neutralizing a dangerous piece (6) Contesting a weak flank (7) Relieving pressure/pins (8) Confusing enemy pieces (9) Reinforcing (10) Striking in the center (11) Escaping Closing/Controlling Open files and diagonals are the canals of attack. If the player with the initiative has uncontested access to them, "the attack plays itself," as the annotators love to say. What they mean is: Winning tactics and threats will virtually suggest themselves. But remember what we said about exploitable and unexploitable weakness? The control of open files and diagonals doesn't mean much if there's no target at the end of them. White's bishop controls the clear b3-g8 diagonal. His rooks look fearsome on the g-file. But he lacks open lines to get at the Black king. Black is so safe that he may be tempted to open lines for his own rooks, with 1 ... f5 2 exf5 ♖xf5. But White's pieces would exploit the lines first with 3 ♖e1! (3 ... ♖ff8 4 ♖xe8 and 5 ♗f7!). The right way to proceed is 1 ... g6!. That shortens the g-file, the only line truly dangerous for Black. It frees the knight from the defense of g7 and prepares a sounder ... f5. White tried to discourage ... f5 with 2 ♗d3 and there followed 2 ... ♖e7 3 c4 ♘g7!. (This is based on 4 ♕xf4 ♕xf4 5 ♖xf4 ♘e6, when Black would regain the pawn favorably.) After 4 c3 was played instead Black prepared ... ♘g5 as well as the advance of his kingside pawns with 4 ... ♘e6!. White tried to cover everything with 5 ♗f1: But 5 ... f5! was powerful because 6 exf5 ♖xf5 would open a path to White's most vulnerable target, h3 ( 7 ... ♖h5 and 8 ... ♘g5). After play continued 6 ♖4g2 ♖f6 7 ♗d3 g5 Black threatened the cute mate 8 ... ♕xh3+! and 9 ... ♖h6 mate. White resigned after 8 ♖h1 g4 9 ♗e2 ♘g5 10 fxg4 f3 11 ♖g3 fxe2. The lesson here: Before a defender can open the lines he wants opened, he has to deal with the potential opening of lines that his opponent wants opened. What this means to the defender is that his goal is to (a) block, (b) contest the control of, or (c) minimize the effect of open lines. Andersson - Yusupov, Leningrad 1987 1 ♘f3 d5 2 d4 c6 3 c4 e6 4 ♘bd2 f5 5 g3 ♗d6 6 ♗g2 ♘d7 7 O-O ♕f6 8 ♘b3 h6 9 ♗f4 ♗xf4 10 gxf4 g5 11 ♕d2 ♘e7 12 fxg5 ♕g7 13 cxd5 ♘xd5 Black is offering a pawn (14 gxh6 ♖xh6) to open kingside files and threaten ... ♖g6. If White defends with 15 ♔h1 and ♖g1, Black would develop threats with ... ♘d7-f6-g4, ... ♗d7, ... O-O-O and ... ♖h8. But with 14 g6! White kept the h-file closed. And if 14 ... ♕xg6 15 ♔h1 ♖g8 16 ♖g1, the g-file might have been more useful to him than to Black (17 ♗h3 ♕f7 18 ♖xg8+ ♕xg8 19 ♖g1). Instead, Black developed, 14 ... b6 15 ♔h1 ♗b7 and White began positional pressure, 16 ♘c1! ♕xg6 17 ♘d3 O-O-O 18 ♖ac1. Black's lack of play on the h-file was felt after 18 ... ♖hg8 19 ♖g1 ♕f6 20 b4 ♔b8 21 a3. When Black tried to force matters with 21 ... f4 22 ♘fe5 c5 he quickly collapsed, 23 bxc5 ♘xe5 24 dxe5 ♕f5 25 c6. It's important for the defender to realize he may have a choice of which lines to open: White's bishop ���doesn't play' and his rook is a bit misplaced at d4. But what matters most is hxg6. For example, 1 ... ♘f6 2 hxg6 hxg6 and now 3 ♕g5! (3 ... ♕xd4 4 ♕xg6+ ♖g7 5 ♕xg7+ ♔xg7 6 ♘xf5+ and ♘xd4). Black solved his problem with 1 ... g5!. If White allows the kingside to be closed (2 ♕d2 h6) Black will dominate the e-file and/or win the d5-pawn after ... ♖e5. So White accepted the pawn, 2 ♕xg5+ ♖g7 3 ♕e3. But after 3 ... f4! 4 ♕e6+ ♔h8 5 ♘e2 ♘e5 it became clear that Black's threats were much more powerful, e.g. 6... ♗c8! 7 ♕h6 ♘g4, trapping the queen. White played 6 ♖xf4 and resigned soon after 6 ... ♘d3+ 7 ♔b1 ♘xf4. Dead Pawn One of the best ways to neutralize a potentially explosive file is to create a 'dead pawn.' This is an advanced enemy pawn that is deliberately not captured because it will block a file. A.Geller - Spassky, Leningrad 1954

But after 22 g6! at least one attacking file will be partly open. However, White saw that there was no follow-up to 23 gxh7+. He should deal instead with Black's threats, beginning with 23 ... bxc2+. The most natural defense is 23 cxb3 axb3 24 axb3. But this loses to 24 ... ♖a1+! 25 ♔xa1 ♕c2 and ... ♖a8 (mate). Moreover 24 a3, instead of 24 axb3, also fails, to 24 ... ♕c2+ 25 ♔a1 ♖xa3+! 26 bxa3 ♕a2 mate. And 23 axb3 axb3 24 c3 loses after 24 ... ♕a5. White found 23 cxb3 axb3 24 ♖c1! and then 24 ... bxa2+ 25 ♔a1. The pawn at a2 is 'dead' and blocking Black's attack. There is a new target now, at b2, but it will take at least three moves for Black's heavy pieces to menace it. And 25 ... ♘c5, with a threat of ... ♘b3 mate, loses to 25 ♖xc5! followed by a killing capture on f7 or h7. Black met the threat to his queen with 25 ... ♕d7 and left White to choose a pawn capture on the kingside. He picked 26 gxf7+ since 26 ... ♕xf7?? loses to 27 ♘h6+. Also bad is 26 ... ♔h8 because of 27 ♘xg7! ♘xg7 28 f8(♕)+ ♖xf8 29 ♕xd7. So 26 ... ♔f8 was forced. There were two dead pawns now. White's attack looks like the faster one because he can move his bishop and threaten ♘xg7. Chances would be roughly equal after 27 ♗f1 ♕xf7 (and 28 ♗c4 d5, for example). But White decided to take aim at d6. After 27 ♖gd1? ♖dc8! and 28 ♖xc8+ ♕xc8! Black was regaining the initiative. For example, 29 ♘xd6 ♘c5! threatens ... ♘b3 mate and allows 30 ♕g3 ♕g4! and wins. The rest was one-sided, 29 ♕g3 ♕c2 30 ♖e1 ♔xf7 31 ♘xd6+ ♔g8 32 h6? ♕d2!
33 f4 exf4 34 ♕c3 ♕xd6 33 ♕b3 ♗c8 34 ♖d1 ♖b8 White resigns.
Repairing Pushing pawns around your castled king is likely to make it more vulnerable. But some pawn weaknesses can be masked, if not eliminated, with the help of a piece. Tal - Witkowski, Riga 1959

He is preparing ... ♗g4, ... ♗f5 or ... ♗b7, followed by ... ♖ae8. It's natural to try to catch up in development. But 16 ♘d2? loses to 16 ... ♘f4!. And 16 ♗e3 walks into 16 ... ♗f5 (17 ♕d1 ♗g4 or 17 ♕d2 ♗e4 18 f4 ♘xg3). Instead, White repaired his only weakness with 16 ♗d5! followed by ♗g2. This turned his kingside into a solid fianchetto setup. Black tried 16 ... ♗f5. But after 17 ♕e3! he couldn't challenge the e-file because 17 ... ♖ae8? 18 ♕xe8! favors White. Instead, he chose 17 ... ♖ad8 and White had eliminated virtually all kingside danger with 18 ♗g2! ♕g4 19 ♘d2 ♕g6 20 ♘f3. Trading We're not done with that last example. After White had repaired his kingside with shifts of minor pieces, Black continued 20 ... ♗g4. Black is preparing ... f5 followed by ... f4 or ... ♖de8. He may even find an opportunity when the sacrifice ... ♘f4 works. But he didn't get the chance because White forced queens off the board with 21 ♕g5!. The attack that was fatally wounded by ♗d5-g2 was buried after 21 ... ♖de8 22 ♕xg6 hxg6 23 ♖xe8 ♖xe8 24 ♗e3. Black, still a pawn down, tried 24 ... f5? but his kingside pieces were at risk after 25 ♘e5 ♗xe5 26 dxe5 threatened f2-f3. He resigned soon after 26 ... f4 27 gxf4. Transition into an ending is a powerful resource because it exploits an imbalance that frequently emerges from an opening: One player concedes positional assets - such as a superior pawn structure or the two-bishop edge - in return for an initiative. He is offering a kind of non- material gambit. But if his opponent can swap down to an ending, what is left are those positional assets. Kharlov - Dreev, St. Petersburg 1993

b6 9 O-O-O ♗b7 10 ♕f4 ♗e7 11 ♗d3 ♘d7 12 h4 White is ready to put a knight on g5 and, if ... ♗xg5, retake with the h-pawn and obtain a powerful attack on the h-file. For example, 12 ... ♘f6 13 ♘xf6+ ♗xf6 14 ♘g5 ♗xg5? 15 hxg5 (15 ... g6 16 ♖h6 and 17 ♖dh1). Black lacks the usual center play because 12 ... c5 13 dxc5 poses problems on the d-file (13 ... bxc5 14 ♗b5; 13 ... ♘xc5 14 ♘xc5 bxc5 15 ♗xh7+ and ♖xd8). But Black has a nice resource, 12 ... ♕b8!. Then 13... c5 will not only attack the center but offer a queen trade that would favor his two bishops. White tried 13 ♘e5 but 13 ... c5! undermined the knight since 14 ♘xd7?? would hang the queen (14 ... ♕xf4+). White protected it with 14 g3?, rather than be more consistent with 14 ♘g5!. There followed 14 ... ♘xe5 15 dxe5. White seems to be ready for 16 ♘g5!? or g3-g4-g5 and ♘f6+!. But Black upset him with 15 ... f5!. White had to choose between a move of the pinned knight, which costs the Exchange, or the endgame of 16 exf6 ♕xf4+!. He chose 16 ♘g5? but after 16 ... ♗xh1 17 ♖xh1 ♕b7 and 18 f3 ♗xg5 19 hxg5 g6 he had no attack and little compensation. He lost quickly. Neutralizing You already know that it takes several pieces to mount a meaningful attack. If the defender can neutralize even one dangerous piece, he may reduce the chances of an initiative drastically. A.Sokolov - Karpov, Candidates match 1987

But he didn't like the looks of 15 ♖fe1 ♘c5! because ... ♘xd3! would have eliminated a very dangerous bishop. But now he is ready for kingside action with 18 f4 or 18 g3 followed by ♘g4. If Black trades queens, 17 ... ♗xe5 18 ♕xe5 ♕xe5 19 ♖xe5, White's two bishops and queenside majority favor him considerably. But Black killed the attack with 17 ... ♗b5! and the idea of 18 ... ♗xd3 (or 18 ... ♗xe5 19 ♕xe5 ♕xe5 20 ♖xe5 and then 20 ... ♗xd3). The game went 18 ♗xb5 ♗xe5 19 ♕xe5 ♕xe5 20 ♖xe5 ♖xd2. White's bishop-over-knight advantage is not nearly as strong as the two-bishop edge would have been. He temporarily trapped the advanced rook with 21 ♗d3. But with aggressive play, 21 ... ♖c8 22 ♖ee1 b5! and 23 a3 ♘d5 24 ♖d1 ♖xd1 25 ♖xd1 a5 26 g3 b4! 27 axb4 ♘xb4, Black was able to trade into a drawish rook endgame. It is particularly important to swap off an opponent's piece if it is vital to his defense as well as to his attack. White has potentially vulnerable pawns at b2, d4, f3 and h2 and a possibly mateable king. Black's last move, ... ♘(f6)-h5, prepared ... ♕f6 as well as ... ♘f4/... ♖h6/... ♕c8-h3. This position had arisen before, when 1 ♔h1 was played. Then 1 ... ♘f4 could be met by 2 ♖g1, safeguarding g2. But Black still had pressure against h2 after 2 ... ♖h6! and 3 ♘d5 ♘xd5 4 ♗xd5 ♕f6 followed by ... g6!, ... ♔g7 and ... ♖bh8. White's improvement was 1 ♘d5!. It stops ... ♕f6 and allows him to trade off the dangerous Black knight after it lands on f4. Black's chances for initiative vanished after 1 ... ♘f4 2 ♕d2! and 2 ... ♘xd5 3 ♗xd5. Moreover White was ready to grab the initiative after the game went 3 ... ♖h6 4 ♖fa1!. With ♖a8! coming up, Black's king is suddenly at greater risk than White's. For example, 4 ... ♕f6 5 ♖a8! ♖xa8 6 ♖xa8+ ♔h7 and now 7 e5! dxe5 8 ♕c2+! g6 9 ♖f8 and ♖xf7+ wins. Note how the splendid bishop defends f3 and also attacks f7. Black tried 4 ... ♕d7. But again 5 ♖a8! ♖xa8 6 ♖xa8+ ♔h7 made 7 e5! strong. If Black had gone after the h2-pawn, 7 ... ♕h3, he would lose to 8 ♗xf7 ♕xh2+ 9 ♔f1 ♕h3+ 10 ♔e2 (10 ... g4 11 ♕d3+ g6 12 e6!). Instead, Black played 7 ... dxe5 8 dxe5 ♕h3. But this time 9 ♗xf7 had a threat of 10 ♖h8+! ♔xh8 11 ♕d8+ and mates, which proved decisive. Trading isn't the only way to neutralize an annoying piece.

Black seems to have only unpleasant options such as 16 ... ♗d7 17 b4 O-O- 0, which allows 18 ♕d2 followed by ♖fb1/ a3-a4 and b4-b5. Or 16 ... ♕xb2 17 ♖b1 ♕c3 18 ♕a4. But Black found the 'ugly' solution to his problems, 16 ... ♔d7!. He would meet 17 ♗xc6+ with 17 ... ♔xd6!. Then he can keep his extra pawn and bring his king to safety (... ♔e7, ... ♖d8). White managed to equalize after 17 ♗f4 ♔e7 18 ♗xc6 bxc6 19 ♗e5 c5 20 b4!. But 17 ... f6! and ... e5 would have rendered the once powerful bishop harmless and given Black winning chances. Contesting The pawn structure that evolves from the opening often dictates the wing that a player will have more operating room. A common error is to write off the other flank as belonging to your opponent. Karjakin - Carlsen, Wijk aan Zee 2010
1 e4 e6 2 d4 d5 3 ♘c3 ♘f6 4 e5 ♘fd7 5 f4 c5 6 ♘f3 ♘c6 7 ♗e3 ♗e7 8 ♕d2 O-O 9

White moved his queen to h4 to target h7 with ♗d3 or ♖f3-h3. Should Black try to distract him with counterplay on the queenside, his wing? No, the right idea was 17 ... ♗xd4 18 ♖xd4 f6!. White replied 19 ♗d3 h6. Then 20 ♕g4 f5 would close the d3-h7 diagonal. White felt forced to liquidate with 20 exf6 ♖xf6. Black has turned the kingside from a liability into an asset. His bad bishop isn't as important as the target f4-pawn. White would be the one forced to defend after 21 ♖g1 ♖cf8 22 ♘e2 e5! 23 fxe5 ♘xe5, for example. No better is 21 g3, which may open the long diagonal for Black's bishop after 21 ... e5. White tried 21 f5 ♖cf8 22 ♖g1 instead. But he was distinctly worse after 22 ... ♘c5! 23 fxe6 ♘xe6 24 ♖g4?! ♘f4 25 ♕g3 ♕e7. To stop ... d4 and an attack on g2, he gave up the Exchange, 26 ♖xf4 ♖xf4, but it wasn't nearly enough. Relieving When we talk of an opponent's pressure, we often mean a pin on a file or diagonal. Breaking a pin can incur great cost: When a White bishop on g5 pins a Black knight at f6 it can be highly weakening to drive the bishop back with ... h6 and ... g5. Computers have taught us that many pins can be safely broken that way. But following Steinitz's principle of economy, it is often better to relieve the pin by either tactics or maneuver. Here's a tactical example. Spassky - Larsen, Belgrade 1970
1 d4 ♘f6 2 c4 e6 3 ♘f3 b6 4 ♘c3 ♗b7 5 ♗g5 ♗e7 6 e3 O-O 7 ♗d3 c5 8 O-O ♘c6 9
d5 ♘b4 10 d6 ♗xd6 11 ♗xh7+ ♔xh7 12 ♕xd6 ♗xf3 13 gxf3 Because Black's h-pawn is gone, he can't relieve the pin with ... h6. And if he doesn't do something fast he will lose the d7-pawn or be forced into passivity after 14 ♖ad1. But Black had counted on 13 ... ♘e8!. The first point is that on a retreat of the attacked White queen, to g3 for example, Black can safely embarrass the bishop with 14 ... f6. More complex are the two Exchange sacrifices that Black offered: (a) He would stand well after 14 ♗xd8 ♘xd6 15 ♗e7 ♘xc4 and 16 ♗xf8 ♖xf8. (b) Better is 14 ♕xf8! ♕xg5+ 15 ♔h1. Black thought he would have sufficient compensation after 15 ... ♕h5 16 ♖g1 ♕xf3+ 17 ♖g2 g6. (Actually, 18 ♔g1! favors White a bit.) Instead he got a tiny edge with 14 ♕e7 ♕xe7 15 ♗xe7 ♖g8 but lost. A creative way to break a pin by a maneuver is illustrated by this:
1 e4 e5 2 ♘f3 ♘c6 3 ♘c3 ♘f6 4 ♗b5 ♗b4 5 O-O O-O 6 d3 d6 7 ♗g5 ♗xc3 8 bxc3
♕e7 9 ♖e1 White protected his e-pawn with the rook so that he can exert pressure on the center with 10 d4. Black should avoid 10 ... exd4 11 cxd4, since White's edge in the center would mean he threatens 12 e5. A surprising plan discovered a century ago, known as the Metger Unpin, proves effective. It begins with 9 ... ♘d8! and then 10 d4 ♘e6. Black wants to play ... ♘xg5. If White retreats the bishop to d2 or c1, Black can apply his own pressure to the center with ... c5. (This is based on a small trap, 11 ♗c1 c5 2 dxe5 dxe5 13 ♘xe5? ♘c7! and Black wins one of the attacked minor pieces.) But what happens if White maintains the pin with 11 ♗h4 ? The answer is 11 ... ♘f4! followed by 12 ... ♘g6 13 ♗g5 h6!. True, Black spends four tempi with his knight. But it is worth it to break the pin that was the key to White's early middlegame pressure. Confusing By 'confusing' we don't mean complicating the position to such a degree that it bewilders an opponent. No, confusing is upsetting the harmonious interplay of enemy pieces. When enemy pieces are coordinated they become dangerous. To stop that, they should be driven to bad squares and their protection from other pieces should be cut. W.Adams - Reshevsky, New York 1936
1 e4 e6 2 d4 d5 3 ♘c3 ♗b4 4 ♗d3 dxe4 5 ♗xe4 ♘f6 6 ♗g5 h6 7 ♗xf6 ♕xf6 8 ♘f3

To thwart that Black needs to push White's pieces around. He started with 15 ... ♗f4! and then 16 ♖c3 ♖d8!. Black's pin on the d-file means he threatens 17 ... e5, e.g. 17 b4 e5! 18 bxc5 exd4 19 ♖d3 ♗e5 (20 ♖e1 ♗g4!). White found 17 ♕c2, feeling that 17 ... ♖xd4 18 ♘xd4 ♕xd4 19 ♖d1 and ♕h7+ was good for him. Black agreed and play went 17 ... g6 18 b4: A key to successful confusing is not to give your opponent time to regroup. Black shot back 18 ... e5! since 19 ♘e2 ♗f5! would have made his advantage obvious. White went for 19 bxc5 exd4 20 ♖b3 instead. Then 20 ... ♗d7! threatened 21 ... ♗a4 and invited 21 ♖xb7 ♗c6. White preferred 21 ♕b2 but Black kept hitting his pieces and pawns, 21 ... ♗c6 22 ♖d1 ♕e7 23 ♖bd3 ♕xc5 24 ♘xd4 ♗e5!. After a liquidation, 25 ♕d2 ♗xd4! 26 ♖xd4 ♖xd4 27 ♕xd4, he won with 27 ... ♕xa3 28 ♕f6 ♕b3! 29 ♖e1 ♖e8! 30 ♖f1 ♕xc4. Traditional defense said enemy pieces should be restrained. New Defense said they should be confused, usually by threatening them or other pieces. The most forceful threat is, of course, a check. Euwe - Reshevsky, AVRO 1938
1 d4 ♘f6 2 c4 g6 3 f3 d5 4 cxd5 ♘xd5 5 e4 ♘b6 6 ♘c3 ♗g7 7 ♗e3 O-O 8 f4 ♘c6 9
d5 ♘b8 10 ♘f3 c6 11 ♕b3 cxd5 12 ♘xd5 ♘xd5 13 exd5 ♘d7 14 ♗e2 After 13 exd5 White's d-pawn can become weak or strong, depending on whether he can coordinate his pieces and defend it (O-O and ♖fd1). But 14 ... ♕a5+! offered White a choice of which of three pieces to misplace. He decided against 15 ♘d2 ♘b6 because he can't defend the pawn with ♖d1. And he rejected 15 ♔f2 because 15 ... ♘f6 would threaten the d-pawn as well as ... ♘g4+. That left 15 ♗d2. Black replied 15 ... ♕b6! since a trade of queens (16 ♕xb6 ♘xb6) would cost the d-pawn. White tried 16 ♗c3 ♗xc3+ 17 bxc3. But then 17 ... ♕e3! ruined White's plans. He would be losing after 18 g3 ♘c5 19 ♕c4 ♘e4 or 19 ♕c2 ♗f5. Instead, he gave up a pawn, 18 c4 ♕xf4 19 O-O. But his hopes of kingside attack were squelched by a piece trade, 19 ... ♕c7 20 ♔h1 ♘f6 21 ♕e3 ♗g4 22 ♕h6 ♗xf3!. Black won following 23 ♖xf3 b5 24 cxb5 ♕e5 25 ♖e1 ♘xd5. Reinforcing Successful attacks are based on a local superiority in firepower: Two attacking pieces are likely to beat one defender. Three attackers will usually outmuscle two defenders, and so on. The simplest way to change an unfavorable imbalance is to add one or more defenders: White's last move, g2-g4, guarantees that he will get back his sacrificed piece with g4-g5. But he's also aiming for mate after f4-f5 followed by f5-f6 or ♗xh6. His queen and rook, with the potential addition of his knight and bishop, might overwhelm the kingside. But Black's 1 ... ♕d8! rushed his queen back in time to defend f6 and g5 or offer a trade (after ... f6, ... ♕e8). And while 2 g5 f6! 3 gxh6 would get White's piece back, 3 ... g6! would close key lines thanks to the dead h-pawn. White would be worse. Another idea is 2 f5 and ♗xh6. But 2 ... ♔g8 3 ♗xh6 g6! would trap the queen (4 fxg6 fxg6+). White chose 2 ♘g1 so that his knight can emerge at f3. But after 2 ... f6 3 f5 ♕e8! a queen trade was coming. White was losing after 4 ♕xe8 ♖xe8 5 exf6 ♗xf6 and resigned after 6 g5 ♖xf5+ 7 ♘f3 ♗d8 8 gxh6 g5! 9 ♖g3 g4 10 ♖xg4 ♖xf3+ 11 ♔e2 ♖ef8. Reinforcement pieces don't nominate themselves. The defender may need to re- examine each of his pieces to find the right one. Black is taking aim at g3 and preparing to attack h2. Until White deals with that he can't safely harvest pawns on the queenside. For example, after 1 ♕xa7? ♕h5 Black has a powerful threat of 2 ... ♖h6 and 3 ... ♕xh2 mate. Another illustration of the force of her pieces is 1 f4 ♕xg3+! with perpetual check (2 hxg3 ♖xg3+ 3 ♔h1 ♖h3+). But White can defend his kingside if he realizes he has a rook doing nothing on the queenside. With 1 ♖a2! he anticipated 1 ... ♕f6 2 f3! ♘g5 3 f4, for example. He even has a threat, 2 f4! (since ... ♕xg3+ no longer works). Black freed her queen from defending the rook at d8 with 1 ... ♖f8 and that permitted her to meet 2 f4 with 2 ... ♕g4. The point is that 3 fxe5 allows 3 ... ♘xg3! (4 ♖g2? ♘e2+!). However, White secured his king's safety with 3 ♕e7 ♖g8 4 ♖g2!. Now g3 and h2 are rock solid and White is free to cash the queenside. After 4 ... ♘d3 5 ♕xa7 Black saw that sacrifices on g3 were doomed to fail. For example, 5 ... ♕h3 6 ♕a6! ♘xg3 7 ♕xd3! wins for White. The same for 6 ... ♘xc1 7 ♖xc1 ♘xg3 8 hxg3 ♖xg3 9 ♖xg3 ♕xg3+ 10 ♔f1 ♕xe3 11 ♘e2. Black had one remaining attacking idea, ... h5-h4xg3. But thanks to that rook at g2 White defended easily, 5 ... h5 6 ♕a6! ♘xc1 7 ♖xc1 h4 8 ♕e2!, and forced a trade of queens into a won endgame. Striking The defender often finds himself with a limited presence in the center. Advancing a pawn to the fourth rank is a way of (a) countering a wing attack, or (b) establishing a foothold for later counterplay. Botvinnik - Ragozin, training match 1936
1 e4 c5 2 ♘f3 e6 3 d4 cxd4 4 ♘xd4 ♘f6 5 ♘c3 d6 6 ♗e2 a6 7 ♗e3 ♕c7 8 a4 b6 9 f4
♗b7 10 ♗f3 ♘bd7 11 ♕e2 ♗e7 12 O-O O-O 13 g4 Black faces 14 g5 and an attack on h7 after ♗g2/♖f3-h3/♕h5. He could have played 13 ... h6. But this violates the principle of economy and makes 14 h4/15 g5 stronger. Steinitz might have played 13 ... ♖fd8 so he could defend with ... ♘f8. But Black wanted counterplay with 13 ... d5! 14 e5 ♘e4! instead. Then 15 ♗xe4 dxe4 16 g5 enables Black to fight for the initiative after 16 ... ♖fd8 and ... ♖ac8/... ♗b4. White preferred 15 ♘xe4 dxe4 16 ♗g2. Even though Black may lose the pawn at e4 he has favorably changed the nature of the middlegame. Play went 16 ... ♗d5 17 ♖fc1 ♖ac8 - so that 18 ♕xa6 ♗c4 19 ♘b5 ♕c6 would threaten 20 ... ♖a8. White went after the e-pawn instead with 18 ♗f2 ♘c5 19 b4. Black unleashed his defensive power with 19 ... ♘d3! 20 cxd3 ♕xc1+ 21 ♖xc1 ♖xc1+. He would overwhelm White after 22 ♗e1 ♗h4 or, as the game went, with 22 ♗f1 ♖fc8 followed by ... ♖a1 and ... ♖cc1. Another example: Suttles - Fischer, Palma de Mallorca 1970

♕xd4 O-O 10 ♘c3 There are no Black kingside pieces to counter a plan such as h2-h4-h5xg6. Bringing in reinforcements (... ♘8d7-f6) would leave Black on the defensive for some time. The correct defense is 10 ... e5!. Black would have too much play after 11 dxe6 ♗xe6 and 12 ... ♘c6. So White let the new center stand with 11 ♕d2 f5! 12 ♘f3 ♘8d7 13 O-O-O ♕f6. Black had the better prospects following 14 ♕h6 ♕e7 15 ♖e1 e4! 16 ♘d2 ♘e5 17 h3 ♘bd7 and his superiority was obvious after 18 ♕e3 ♕h4 19 g3 ♕f6 20 ♔b1 ♘c5 21 f4? exf3 22 ♘xf3 f4! 23 gxf4 ♘xf3 24 ♕xf3 ♕h4. Escaping When reinforcements are not readily available to an endangered wing, it may make sense just to flee. In many cases you don't have to run far. Bernstein - Fischer, Montreal 1956
1 d4 ♘f6 2 ♘f3 g6 3 ♘c3 d5 4 ♗f4 ♗g7 5 e3 O-O 6 ♗e2 ♘h5 7 ♗g5 h6 8 ♗h4 g5 9

But after 18 dxe5 White threatens 19 ♖h1 followed by 20 ♖h8+! ♔xh8 21 ♕h7 mate. Easier seems 17 ... ♖f6 18 ♕xg5 fxe3 but White still has some play after 19 ♘xc6 bxc6 21 fxe3 followed by ♗g6/♕h5/g4-g5. Black opted for the simplest way out, 17 ... ♘xe5 18 dxe5 ♖f7 and 19 ♘b5 ♔f8!. Black seized the initiative after 20 ♘d6 ♖d7 21 ♗b5 ♖xd6 22 exd6 ♗d7 23 ♗xd7 ♕xd7. A more elaborate example of escape: Speelman - Luther, Lippstadt 2000 1 ♘f3 d5 2 c4 e6 3 d4 ♘f6 4 ♘c3 c6 5 e3 ♘bd7 6 ♕c2 ♗d6 7 ♗d3 O-O 8 O-O dxc4 9 ♗xc4 a6 10 ♗d3 c5 11 ♗d2 ♕c7 12 ♖ac1 c4 13 ♘e4 ♘xe4 14 ♗xe4 f5 15 ♗d3 b5 16 b3! ♗b7 17 bxc4 ♖f6 Black's last move prepares 18 ... ♖g6 and 18 ... ♗xf3 19 gxf3 ♗xh2+ (20 ♔g2 ♖g6+). What about reinforcements? The problem with 18 ♕d1 is that 18 ... ♖g6 already threatens 19 ... ♗xh2+ 20 ♘xh2? ♖xg2+. Rather than 18 cxb5 ♕b8 White preferred 18 ♖fe1!? because it creates an escape hatch for the king at f1. (The rook is better placed at e1 than d1 in case White gets to play 19 e4.) Black inflicted kingside damage, 18 ... ♗xf3 19 gxf3 ♖g6+ 20 ♔f1, and then played 20 ... ♗a3!, clearing a path for his queen to h2. Play continued 21 cxb5 ♕xh2. White would like to break the Black initiative with 22 ♕c7 and then 22 ... ♕h3+ 23 ♔e2 ♗xc1 24 ♖xc1 ♘f6 25 b6 and 26 b7. But Black has better in 22 ... ♗d6! 23 ♕xd7 ♖g2!. White's king is a fatal liability, e.g. 24 ♖e2 ♕h1 mate; 24 ♔e2 ♖xf2+ 25 ♔d1 ♖xd2 mate and 24 ♕xe6+ ♔h8 25 ♖c8+ ♗f8!. The right defense is escape: 22 ♔e2! since he can cover f2 with a rook or bishop (22 ... ♖g2 23 ♖f1). The game went 22 ... ♗xc1 23 ♖xc1 axb5 24 ♕c6 ♖a7? 25 ♗xf5! and wins (25 ... exf5 26 ♕d5+ and ♖c8+ or 25 ... ♖f6 26 ♗xe6+! ♔h8 27 ♕xd7!). And now let's see what you've learned about the weapons of defense. Quiz White can make progress with ♖af1. What can Black do? Should Black capture on h5, allow hxg6 or pick door number three? Should Black be worried about a sacrifice on h6? How does he best safeguard his king? White will have attacking chances if he can play ♖e3 and ♘h5. For example, 1 ... ♗a6 2 ♖e3 ♗xc4 and now 3 ♘h5 ♘xh5 leaves White with a choice between 4 ♕xh5 f5 5 ♗xg7! (or 5 ♖g3 g6 6 ♖xg6+) and 4 ♗xh7+! ♔xh7 5 ♕xh5+ ♔g8 6 ♗xg7! and wins. What can Black do instead? White's attack is based on h4-h5xg6 and ♖h4. Is 1 ... ♗g7 the best? White can try to penetrate on the h-file. But ♖g2, ♘f2 and g3-g4xf5 - or the immediate g3-g4 - are also attractive. What should Black do? Mikhail Tal could defend when he wanted to. Here he faces an ominous ♖h3. Does 1 ... g6 work? Is there anything better? White seems to have an edge in the center. What can Black do? Evaluate 1...fxg6 2 hxg6 h6 and 2...hxg6. Should Black just ignore the g6-pawn? Chapter Five: Counterplay "When you have Black, your goal is to equalize," masters used to say. "If you accomplish that, you can try for an advantage," they added. That was the credo of great players like Jose Capablanca, Akiba Rubinstein and Paul Keres. But they didn't play the Najdorf Sicilian. One of the problems with the Najdorf is that "it's useless to play for equality," as GM Yuri Razuvaev put it. That is, Black cannot reach an equal sign by trading a few minor pieces as Capablanca et al did when they defended a Queen's Gambit Declined or a 1 e4 e5 opening. Instead, Black must seek counterplay. That could also be said of many other sharp openings - the King's Indian, Pirc and Benoni Defenses, the Dragon and Sveshnikov Sicilian, and the Winawer Variation of the French Defense to name a few. In this position, which arose from a Najdorf, the only easy way to trade pieces, with 1 ... ♗c4, just hands White ♘f5!. Instead, Black chose the aggressive 1 ... ♘h5!? and ... ♘hf4, which seeks a kingside advantage. (Black doesn't fear ♘xe6 because after ... fxe6 the e6 pawn can't be attacked and it stops ♘d5.) White's reply, 2 ♘d5 ♗xd5 3 exd5, was logical. But after 3 ... ♘hf4 4 ♗f1 ♕d7 5 c4 h5! 6 ♖c1 ♗e5. Black's pieces were better coordinated than his. Black's impending ... g4 offers more than mere counterchances. Black can't stop that push but he can take precautions such as 7 ♕d2 and 7 ... g4 8 h4, to keep the h-file closed. Instead, he went into 7 ♔g1 g4! 8 fxg4 hxg4 9 ♕xg4? ♕xg4 10 hxg4, overlooking 10 ... ♘xd5! (11 cxd5 ♗h2+ 12 ♔h1 ♗f4+). Black had the edge after 11 ♗d3 ♗h2+ 12 ♔f1 ♗f4 13 ♖cd1 ♘f6 and won soon after 14 g3 ♗e5 15 ♗e2 ♘e4! 16 ♘f5 e6! 17 ♗f3 ♘xf2 18 ♖xd6!? ♘h1!. The First Line of Defense Traditional defense set the priorities this way: First, you make sure your king is safe. Second, you need to secure other potential targets. Third - and only then - you can begin looking for ways to make threats and exert pressure. Counterplay is appropriate when you're in trouble. It's the last line of defense. But according to New Defense it's the first line. An illustration comes when the Nimzo-Indian Defense, 1 d4 ♘f6 2 c4 e6 3 ♘c3 ♗b4, is challenged by 4 a3 ♗xc3+ 5 bxc3. White accepts doubled c-pawns in return for freedom to expand in the center. Early efforts at defense tried to exploit the c-pawns - but only after Black was safely castled, e.g., 5 ... c5 6 e3 ♘c6 7 ♗d3 O-O 8 ♘e2 b6 9 e4! ♘e8 10 O-O d6. Black's ... ♘e8 is a prophylactic idea introduced by Capablanca in a similar position. Black retreats so that he can stop a powerful f2-f4-f5! by meeting 11 f4 with 11 ... f5. But in a 1948 game, White found a tactical flaw here: 11 e5! dxe5 12 dxe5 so that 12 ... ♘xe5?? 13 ♗xh7+ and ♕xd8 costs a queen. The strategic point is that the pawn at e5 prevents a Black knight from returning to defend at f6. For example, 12 ... ♗a6 13 ♗f4 ♘a5 goes after the c4-pawn. But White's attack is faster, 14 ♕c2 g6 15 ♗h6 and ♘g3. In the game, Black tried 12 ... ♗b7 13 ♗f4 f5 to contest the kingside. After 14 exf6 he didn't like the looks of 14 ... ♕xf6 15 ♕c2 or 14 ... ♘xf6 (although 15 ♗d6 ♖f7 is fairly harmless). He went in for 14 ... e5 and White won after 15 fxg7! ♖xf4 16 ♘xf4 exf4 17 ♗xh7+! ♔xh7 18 ♕h5+ ♔xg7 19 ♖ad1 ♕f6 20 ♖d7+. Or 19 ... ♕c7 20 ♕g4+ and ♖d7(+). Improvements were found, of course. Black can delay ... d6 in favor of 10 ... ♗a6 and win the c4-pawn after ... ♘d6. And that indicated what Black's real problem was: He was seeking counterplay too late. Today one of the best ways to handle this variation begins with 5 ... b6, rather than 5 ... c5, with quicker pressure against the c4-pawn. A main line runs 5 ... b6 6 f3 ♗a6 7 e4 ♘c6! 8 ♗d3 ♘a5. By not castling Black saves a tempo. But he also denies his opponent a more stationary target, a king at g8. True, he allows 9 e5. But experience has shown that 9 ... ♘g8 offers Black excellent chances. The c4-pawn cannot be defended for long. After 9 ♕e2 Black can play 9 ... d6 followed by ... ♕d7-a4 and, if necessary, ... c5 and ... ♖c8. It is virtually certain Black will achieve his goal - winning the pawn - and put the onus on White. The moral is simple: If you can generate threats, even in the opening, in a part of the board where your opponent is vulnerable, you may distract him from the area where you are weaker. Then his pressure never becomes an initiative. Or his initiative never becomes overwhelming. This is why today's players are willing to delay castling much longer than their predecessors: Granda Zuniga - Lenier Dominguez, Wijk aan Zee 2004
1 d4 d5 2 c4 c6 3 ♘c3 ♘f6 4 ♘f3 e6 5 e3 ♘bd7 6 ♕c2 ♗d6 7 g4 dxc4 8 g5 ♘d5 9
♗xc4 b6 10 ♗d2 ♗b7 11 O-O-O A player of an older generation might have reacted to White's quick g-pawn push with the safety-minded 11 ... ♕c7 and ... O-O-O. But that is unnecessary because Black's king isn't a target yet. However, the White queen and king on the c-file were, after 11 ... ♖c8! and ... c5. White got his king off the file, 12 ♔b1. But 12 ... b5 13 ♗e2 ♘xc3+ was still good, as 14 ♗xc3? b4 15 ♗d2 c5! with an edge would have shown. White played the more accurate 14 ♕xc3 b4 15 ♕d3. But Black would have excellent compensation after 15 ... c5 16 dxc5 ♘xc5 and then 17 ♕b5+ ♗c6 18 ♕xb4 ♘e4 19 ♕d4 O-O. For example, 20 ♗e1 ♕c7 and ... ♗d5, threatening ... ♕c2+, or ... ♖fd8. (Note that the check at move 17 was the only drawback to Black's delay in castling.) Instead of 16 dxc5, White went for 16 b3. Only now did Black play 16 ... O-O. His queenside initiative was well ahead of whatever White had hoped to do on the other wing. Black was headed to victory after 17 ♖hg1 ♕b6 18 ♗c1 ♗d5! 19 e4 c4!. The different attitude of New Defense is reflected in openings with quiet reputations, such as the Caro-Kann Defense. Masters used to assume that Black would have to deal cautiously with pressure until he can equalize. Today Black thinks differently:
1 e4 c6 2 d4 d5 3 ♘c3 dxe4 4 ♘xe4 ♘d7 5 ♗c4 ♘gf6 6 ♘g5 e6 7 ♕e2 ♘b6 8 ♗d3
h6 9 ♘5f3 c5 10 dxc5 ♗xc5 11 ♗d2 O-O 12 O-O-O White has two aggressive ideas: He can centralize one knight, ♘e5, reinforce it with ♘gf3, and then push his protected g-pawn to g5. Or he can go for an open kingside with a quicker g2-g4!. For example, 12 ... ♘bd7 discourages 13 ♘e5 but invites 13 ♘h3 and 14 g4, e.g. 13 ... a6 14 g4! ♘xg4 15 ♖hg1 with a strong attack. After Black lost several times in this variation, annotators blamed the passive Caro-Kann. But the timid 12 ... ♘bd7 was the culprit. The right idea is 12 ... ♘a4!. White's king can be as vulnerable as Black's, e.g. 13 ♘e5? ♕b6! 14 b3? ♗a3+ 15 ♔b1 ♘d5!, threatening a 'family check' on c3. White does better with 13 ♗b5. But retreating the attacked knight is out of the question. Black's best is 13 ... ♗d7, e.g. 14 ♗xd7 ♕xd7! and now the discovered attack on the queen, 15 ♗xh6, allows 15 ... ♕c7 and 16 ... ♕b6. The same goes for 14 ♗xa4 ♗xa4 15 ♗xh6, when Black has compensation after 15 ... ♕b6. Other-Wing Counterplay The defender typically launches action on 'his' wing, the queenside for Black in these last examples. But New Defense also explores counter-intuitive counterplay. White's kingside attack is well ahead of Black's queenside effort and he would have the edge after hxg6. Then ... fxg6 would allow ♗xe5 followed by f6-f7+ while ... hxg6 and ... ♘xg6 invite a heavy piece invasion of the h-file. Black's 1 ... gxh5! was stunning but logical. The only real targets he had to attack were White pawns, at h5, g5 and e4, and this exploits them (2 ♕xh5? ♗xe4). Still, 1 ... gxh5! looked risky. Can Black last long after 2 ♗g2 protects the e-pawn and prepares 3 ♕xh5 and 4 ♖h1 ? The answer came from 2 ... ♘g4!, which threatened ... ♖xg5. Play continued 3 ♕d2 ♕a5 and White set a trap with 4 ♖h1. If 4 ... ♖xg5?, White can cut communication of the heavy pieces with 5 e5! and threaten both 6 ♕xg5+ and 6 ♗xb7. But Black had another surprise, 4 ... h6! so that 5 gxh6 ♗xh6 or 5 ♖xh5 ♖xg5 favors him. White gambled on 5 e5 dxe5 6 ♗b6 instead. But Black's two extra minor pieces were better than White's extra rook after 6 ... ♖xb6 7 ♘xb6 ♕xb6 8 ♖xh5 ♗xg2 9 ♕xg2 ♘e3! 10 ♕g1 ♘d5!. Counterplay = Threats For counterplay to go beyond mere 'clutching' it has to generate threats. This may require ingenuity. White is a pawn ahead and his knights have pawn-protected outposts at e4 and c5 that make them at least as good as Black's bishops. It is easy to visualize White improving his position with ♘bc5 followed by ♕a6 or ♖d1-d6. Or he can play ♖a1 followed by ♘bc5 and ♖a6 or ♖a7. His winning chances would be excellent. Black kick-started his counterplay with a major decision, 1 ... ♗xe4!. His first point was tactical, 2 ♕xe4? ♕a2+ loses a knight. His second point was strategic: after 2 fxe4 there were potential targets at e4 and c3. Clutching followed: 2 ... ♕a3 3 ♕c2 ♕a6 4 ♘c5 ♕c4 5 ♕d3. With 5 ... ♕g8! Black began to go beyond harassment. He prepared ... ♖d8 and could refute 6 ♖d1? with 6 ... ♕a2+! (7 ♔g1 ♕h2+). At first it appears 6 ♕d7 ♖d8 7 ♕xc6 is winning. But 7 ... ♕c4 would get messy. Safer is 6 ♖f2 (to guard against ... ♖d8-d2+). White would remain in control after 6 ... ♖d8 7 ♕a6 ♗e3 8 ♖e2. However, he opted for 6 ♕d7 ♖d8 7 ♕e6? because it seems to shut out the Black queen. But this failed after 7 ... ♖d2+ 8 ♖f2 ♕d8!. It was a good time to head towards a draw with 9 ♖xd2 ♕xd2+ 10 ♔f1 ♕d1+ and a perpetual check. But White didn't appreciate how much counterplay had developed and he allowed 9 ♘b3? ♖d3!. In the face of a killing 10 ... ♖g3+ White tried 10 ♖f3 ♖xf3 11 ♔xf3. But Black picked off three pawns - all with check (11 ... ♕d3+ 12 ♔f2 ♕e3+! 13 ♔f1 ♕f3+ 14 ♔e1 ♕xc3+ etc.) - and won. Counterplay vs. Material Defending a difficult position often seems like taking a school test with a long list of questions about material: Is it worth grabbing a pawn when you know it hands your opponent an initiative? Is it better to make prophylactic moves before seeking a material edge? We'll get to those questions in later chapters. But here's another: Is it better to have counterplay or an extra pawn? Anatoly Karpov gave his answer three times in this game: Kamsky - Karpov, Elista 1996
1 e4 c6 2 d4 d5 3 ♘d2 dxe4 4 ♘xe4 ♘d7 5 ♘g5 ♘gf6 6 ♗d3 e6 7 ♘1f3 ♗d6 8 ♕e2
h6 9 ♘e4 ♘xe4 10 ♕xe4 ♘f6 11 ♕e2 ♕c7 12 ♗d2 b6 13 O-O-O ♗b7 14 ♖he1 O-O 15 g4!? First, he rejected 15 ... ♘xg4? because 16 ♖g1 is too dangerous (16 ... ♘f6 17 ♗xh6). Instead, he used one of the basic weapons we examined in Chapter Four, a strike in the center, 15 ... c5!. Then came 16 g5 hxg5. By getting his b7-bishop into the game Black could punish 17 ♗xg5? with 17 ... ♗f4+! 18 ♔b1? ♗xf3! or 18 ♗xf4 ♕xf4+ (19 ♔b1 ♗xf3 or 19 ♘d2 cxd4). White's 17 ♘xg5 posed a second question for Black. Should he grab another pawn, 17 ... ♗xh2 ? No, he decided. Opening the other half of the h-file was foolhardy when he could limit the coordination of White pieces with 17 ... ♗f4! instead. White posed a third question with 18 h4 and Black went into "a long think," as he put it. Black can take the pawn at d4, perhaps reinforcing it later with a trade of bishops and ... e5. "But the d-file would be closed and the White king would be secure," Karpov said. The White bishop at d3 would be immune to ... c4 and "I would have little counterplay and be on the defensive for quite a while," he added. He preferred 18 ... ♖ad8! to get his rook to the fine d4 square. Then his pieces would be well-coordinated and ... c4 would be in the air. Play went 19 dxc5 bxc5. Black's queen rook would make itself felt after 20 ♖g1 c4! 21 ♗xc4 ♖xd2! 22 ♖xd2 ♗xd2+ (23 ♕xd2 ♕xc4 or 23 ♔xd2 ♕f4+). White avoided that with 20 ♗e3 but then came 20 ... ♖d4!. Black is in better shape for material grabbing than before, thanks to his counterplay, e.g. 21 h5 ♗xe3+ 22 fxe3 ♖h4 followed by ... ♖xh5 or ... c4. White got better mileage out of 21 ♖g1! and then 21 ... ♗xe3+ 22 fxe3 (not 22 ♕xe3 ♕f4!) ♖xh4 23 ♖df1 because of his prospects for ♖xf6. Black organized his pieces well, 23 ... ♕e5 24 ♕f2 ♖h6!. But White was still able to obtain enough play, 25 ♖g3 ♗e4 26 ♖fg1! g6 (26 ... ♗xd3? 27 ♘f3! and ♖xg7+) 27 ♖f1 ♔g7 28 ♕xf6+! ♕xf6 29 ♖xf6 ♗xd3 30 ♖xf7+ to reach a salvageable ending. Sacrifice for Counterplay There's a related puzzle for defenders to solve: If counterplay can be better than pawn-grabbing, what about giving up a pawn to seize the initiative from an attacker? This question taxed 19th century defenders. White had steadily increased the pressure on the c6-pawn during the middlegame and would have continued to do so after 1 ... ♕e8 2 ♖a1 followed by ♖a6-b6. But Black looked for a target and naturally saw b4. He played 1 ... ♖cb7! and then 2 ♖b1 ♖d7!. It was a tacit offer of a pawn - or of a draw by repetition (3 ♖bd1 ♖db7!). White accepted the pawn, 3 ♖xc6, and Black seized the d-file with 3 ... ♖bd8. In the tournament book, Siegbert Tarrasch seemed shocked in the change. Black's position had not been this good "in the entire game," he wrote. When White prepared to push the c-pawn with 4 ♖b6 Black got to make threats, 4 ... f5 5 ♗f3 ♖d4 6 ♕a6 ♕h4! (rather than 6 ... ♖xf4? 7 ♖b7 ♖d7 8 c6!). Black's heavy pieces are active: Now 7 ♖b7+ ♔g8 8 c6? would have been met by 8 ... ♕xf4 9 c7 ♕e3+ 10 ♔f1 ♖d2 11 ♗e2 ♖c8 and Black holds (or 10 ♔h1? ♖d1+!). White did better with 7 g3 ♕f6 8 ♕e2. But 8 ... ♖d3! prepared a strong queen check on d4. Play went 9 c6 ♕d4+ 10 ♔h1 ♖e3 11 ♕f1 ♕c3. Now 12 ♖c1 would fail to 12 ... ♖xf3 13 ♖xc3 ♖xf1+ 14 ♔g2 ♖fd1!. A key point is that 15 c7 ♖8d2+ 16 ♔h3? ♖h1! walks into a mating net. So the Black rooks took over the seventh rank, 12 ♗g2 ♖d2 13 c7 ♖c2! 14 ♖d1 ♖3e2 15 ♕f3 ♖xg2! 16 ♕xc3 ♖xh2+ and drew by perpetual check. Tarrasch added that the turn of events after 3 ... ♖bd8 "is quite a common occurrence." It happens when a player converts positional pressure into a material edge, he said. "A crisis arises in which the strategically lost player obtains the opportunity for counterattack." Tarrasch hinted that a "strategically lost player" didn't deserve this reversal of fortune. But it makes sense: In the first diagram Black's pieces were passively tied to the defense of the c6-pawn. Once freed from that duty, they came into their own. Here's how this works in a modern opening, the Dragon Sicilian. Black had fared badly when this position arose in previous games because he tried to defend the backward pawn at d6. After 1 ... ♖c6 2 ♘a5 ♖b6 3 ♘c4 he is only helping White. But in this game he just ignored the threat, 1 ... ♖ec8! 2 ♕xd6 ♗e6. Black's rooks and bishop were then ready to make threats of their own. And after 3 c3 b5: White no longer has a target at d6. Instead, he faces the prospect of ... a5-a4 or ... b4. Play went 4 ♕d2 a5 and now 5 ♘xa5 ♖a4 6 ♘b3 ♖8a8 7 ♘c1 ♗xa2+ would be fine for Black. But he also had compensation in the game after 5 ♕g5 ♕xg5 6 hxg5 a4. He sailed into a draw after 7 ♘d2 ♖4c7 8 a3 ♖d7 9 ♔c1 f6 10 gxf6+ ♔xf6 11 ♘f1 ♖xd1+ 12 ♔xf1 ♖d8+ and ... ♔g5. The initiative-stealing sacrifice is another version of changing the nature of the struggle. An opponent who wins a weak pawn may feel that he is winning the game. That often lures him into carelessness: Both players have pawns to attack, at d7 and e5. But Black is behind in development and that would cost him after 1 ... ♘xe5? 2 ♘xe5 ♗xe5 3 ♗xe5 ♕xe5? 4 ♘d6+ and White wins. If he tries to protect d7 with 1 ... ♕a7 and ... ♖d8 - so that he can castle without hanging the d-pawn - White would get an edge from 2 c4! bxc4 3 ♕xc4 ♖d8 and then 4 h4! ♘c6 5 ♘c5. Black would love to play the blocking 1 ... ♘d5 but 2 ♖xd5! is dangerous (2 ... exd5 3 ♘d6+ ♗xd6 4 exd6+ ♔f8 5 ♘h4! ♘xh4 6 ♗xh4 with strong compensation and a much easier position for White to play than Black). Black solved his problem with 1 ... O-O!, abandoning the d-pawn. After White grabbed it, 2 ♖xd7, he brought his knight to an outpost, 2 ... ♘d5. White has no obvious goal now that the d-pawn is gone. Moreover, his e-pawn is threatened and his rook, now behind enemy lines, may be embarrassed by ... ♕c8. White chose the natural 3 ♘d6. It rules out ... ♕c8 and ... ♘xe5. It also prepares an attack on f7 using the rook and both knights. White had a positional edge previously so the attack seems to make sense. But after 3 ... ♘b6! White had to sacrifice, 4 ♖xf7 ♖xf7 5 ♘xf7 ♔xf7. Even though chances were roughly equal after 6 ♘g5+ ♔g8! (6 ... ♔e7 7 ♕g4) 7 ♘xe6 ♕c8 and 8 ♕g4 ♖a7!, White was soon outplayed and lost, 9 ♖d1 ♘a4! 10 h3 ♘xb2 11 ♖d5 ♗b6 12 ♖d6 ♘c4. Three becomes Two We usually think of counterplay as a feature of middlegames. But changing a trend at the cost of material can also alter the likely outcomes of an early endgame. Once again this has a psychological benefit. Black threatens 1 ... ♖xa2+ and there is no good way to defend the pawn (1 ♔b2 ♖b8+ 2 ♔a1?? ♘b3+). Of course, losing the a-pawn would simply make material equal. But with the only passed pawn and more active pieces than White's, Black would have reasonable winning chances. "All three outcomes are possible," grandmasters say - meaning a win, a loss or a draw. White changed that with 1 ♖xa5! ♖xa5 2 ♗xc4. Then he had two pawns and a strong bishop for a rook. With his king to shepherd the a-pawn and a potentially passed d-pawn, his winning chances had risen and his losing chances had dropped. Two outcomes - a White win or a draw - were much more likely. Black appreciated that and played 2 ... h5 3 h4 ♖c8! 4 ♔d3. Now on 4 ... ♖a3+ 5 ♗b3 White would have excellent winning chances once he creates a passed d-pawn (6 e4 and 7 d5). Black defended with 4 ... ♖xc4! 5 ♔xc4 ♖xa2. White now had an extra pawn in a rook endgame. But there was no passed pawn and Black's rook was very active. The most likely outcome, by far, was a draw. After 25 more moves that was the result. We saw a related phenomenon when we considered Lasker's aggressive approach in Chapter Three. He sought to turn a position with two likely results - a loss and a draw - into one with three outcomes. Typically, this requires the defender to choose the best practical move over the objectively best move. A pawn down and facing two bishops, Black's best drawing chance lies in trading pawns. After 1 ... cxd4! 2 ♕xd4 ♘c5 White is a long way from making progress. Better is 2 exd4 but the d-pawn will be held in check by ... ♘f6 followed by ... ♖d8. But Black chose the objectively inferior 1 ... c4!? because it creates a passed pawn and potential winning chances. It also poses some difficult choices for White. After the game he concluded that he should have played 2 ♕e4 ♘f6 3 ♕c2 followed by pushing his e-pawn. But psychologically it is very hard, in such an apparently favorable position, to retreat like that instead of taking a second pawn with 2 ♗xh7+? ♔xh7 3 ♕e4+ ♔g8 4 ♕xe7. But Black's passed pawn grew in power after 4 ... c3!. For example, 5 a4 c2 6 ♗a3 would be met by 6 ... ♖b8 followed by ... ♖b1 or ... ♕c6 and ... ♕xa4. White tried instead to push his center pawns, 5 e4 c2! 6 d5 but they were less threatening than the c-pawn after 6 ... ♖b8, Play went 7 g3 ♕c8 8 ♕g5 ♕c4 9 f3 ♖b3 with the idea of ... ♕d4+ and ... ♘e5. White couldn't adjust to the idea that he might lose. He played 10 ♕d2? ♖d3 11 ♕e2 ♘e5 12 ♔g2 ♖d1! and lost after 13 ♕xc4 ♘xc4 14 d6 ♔f8 15 a4 ♔e8 16 ♔f2 ♘d2! 17 ♖e1 ♘xf3!. Is active always better than solid? No, some players will feel more comfortable and have better results with moves like 1 ... cxd4. And in some positions, solid will outscore active nine times out of ten. But you should still be looking for counterplay as your first line of defense. Quiz What should Black be thinking? Where does Black's best chance for counterplay lie? White threatens to win a pawn with 1 gxh6. After 1 ... hxg5 2 ♕xg5 the impending 3 h6 retains his winning chances. What can Black do? Chapter Six: Risk Management Risk is bad, according to traditional defense. It should be reduced to the minimum. Of course, this point of view recognized that risk couldn't be eliminated entirely. But a position with a 20 percent chance of losing was considered good - even though there might only be a 20 percent of winning. That situation was preferable, according to the conventional wisdom, to a highly double-edged position with a 40 percent chance of losing - even if there is a 50 percent chance of winning. This, too, has changed. Today's masters are more willing to take an acceptable risk. What is acceptable? Defining that has become as important as identifying risk itself.

But he knew that if he survived, his extra material would win easily. Should he calculate 19 ... ♗xa1 as far as he can see? Or is it better to look for mating chances against White? Should he investigate 19 ... ♘f6, instead? And what about offering a trade of queens with 19 ... ♕d4 ? Pragmatism is a good guide here. Black realized that the simple and solid 19 ... ♕c6 made sense. After 20 ♕xc6 bxc6 his risk of losing would be tiny - and his winning chances would be much greater than if he damaged his pawn with 19 ... ♕a6+ 20 ♕xa6 bxa6. He also had to evaluate his chances if White avoided the endgame, (19 ... ♕c6) 20 ♕a3+ ♔d7 or 20 ♗a3+ ♔d7 21 ♕f4 ♘f6. Of course, he might lose due to a blunder in a complex position then. But his winning chances would be much greater than his losing chances. In the end Black chose 19 ... ♕c6 and won the endgame after 20 ♕xc6 bxc6 21 ♖b1 ♔d6 22 ♗a3+ c5. He had found an acceptable - and successful - degree of risk. Comfort Zone Every defender wants to find his or her comfort zone. But what may seem safe to one player may not feel safe to another. There are many positions that are objectively safe because that's what a superior player - or a computer - says. But they may not be acceptable to you. With h4-h5 and ♘f6+ coming up Black took the common-sense precaution 1 ... ♔f8. We'll consider moves like that - what we call prophylactic - in more detail in Chapter Eight. For the time being, let's consider Black's comfort zone. He later found that a computer recommended 1 ... ♘xe5 and 2 ♘f6+ ♔h8. For example, 3 ♖xe5 can be met by 3 ... ♗xf3. And 3 ♘xe5 could lead to 3 ... gxf6 4 ♗xf5 exf5 and 5 ... fxe5. "But of course I wouldn't dream of this," Black added. Few humans would. The risk is outside their comfort zone. There are many positions on which humans disagree about what is acceptable risk. Morozevich - Gelfand, Biel 2009

A previous grandmaster game went 12 ♕xd5 ♕b6! and 13 ♖e2 ♘f6 14 ♕b3 ♕a6 15 ♘c3 ♗e6 16 ♕a4. White eventually won - but perhaps not because the gambit was unsound. In this game White considered 12 ♕xd5 only briefly because it seemed to him that Black had plenty of compensation. That doesn't mean that Black would be better after 12 ♕xd5. White just felt that his opponent would have enough play to make his life unpleasant for several moves. It's clear in the diagram that Black is going to gain time with ... ♕b6 no matter what White does. He looked at 12 ♕d3 and realized it would give him a small edge, in view of the isolated d5-pawn, but with very little risk. White was the one making threats after 12 ... ♕b6 13 ♖e2 ♘f6 14 ♘c3 ♗g4 15 ♘a4 ♕c6, as the game went, and eventually won the ending after 16 ♘xc5 ♕xc5 17 ♗e3 ♕c4 18 ♖d2 ♕xd3 19 ♖xd3. Tal's Credo Mikhail Tal helped overthrow the traditional view of risk. "A chess player sacrifices a piece for attack," he wrote in a celebrated article. "Does he risk? Of course, because the attack could be repelled." Then Tal asked a second question: What about his opponent? "A chess player accepts the sacrifice (even though he could decline), hoping to repel the attack. Does he risk? Of course, because the attack can be irresistible." "Whose risk is greater? There's no device that can measure that clearly," Tal concluded. Let's see how two great modern players evaluate risk: Anand - Ivanchuk, Belgrade 1997
1 e4 e5 2 ♘f3 ♘c6 3 ♗b5 a6 4 ♗a4 ♘f6 5 O-O b5 6 ♗b3 ♗b7 7 ♖e1 ♗c5 8 c3 O-O 9
d4 ♗b6 10 ♗e3 cxd4 11 exd4 ♘a5 12 ♗g5 ♘xb3 13 axb3 h6 14 ♗h4 g5 Black's last move met the threat of 15 e5. Was it risky? To properly answer that you have to measure it against a safer-looking alternative. But is 14 ... d6 really safer? It doesn't appear so in view of 15 ♘bd2 followed by ♕c2 and the renewed threat of e4-e5. To judge 15 ♘xg5 correctly we have to examine the alternative, 15 ♗g3 and the natural response 15 ... ♘xe4!. And when we can't find compensation for White's lost pawn then, we should look for compensation instead after the piece sacrifice, 15 ♘xg5 hxg5 16 ♗xg5. The threat of 17 e5 offers plenty of 'comp,' as 16 ... d6 17 ♖e3 ♖e8 18 ♖f3 indicates. This explains why White chose 15 ♘xg5! - and Black replied 15 ... ♘xe4!. A quick look indicates 16 ♖xe4? ♗xe4 is unsound, e.g. 17 ♕h5 hxg5 18 ♗xg5 f6 or 18 ... ♗g6. So he had to content himself with 16 ♘xe4 ♕xh4 17 ♘bc3. Material is still equal. The most striking features of the position are Black's two bishops and ruptured kingside. Can he afford to take a new risk, say with 17 ... b4 ? After a brief examination of 18 g3! Black backed off (18 ... ♕h3 19 ♘f6+ ♔- moves 20 ♘cd5 or 18 ... ♕d8 19 ♕g4+ ♔h8 20 ♕h5 or 19 ... ♔h7 20 ♕f5+ with a strong attack). Instead he opted for the safety of 17 ... ♔h8. His bishops and play along the g- file were enough to grant him equal chances after 18 ♘c5 ♗c6 19 g3 ♖g8 20 ♖e5! ♖g4! 21 ♘5e4 ♖ag8. A draw was reached at move 32. A variation on that theme is this position:
1 e4 e6 3 d4 d5 3 ♘c3 dxe4 4 ♘xe4 ♘d7 5 ♘f3 ♘gf6 6 ♗d3 c5 7 ♘xf6+ ♘xf6 8
dxc5 ♗xc5 9 ♕e2 O-O 10 ♗g5 h6 11 h4 ♕a5+ 12 ♗d2 ♕b6 Black rejected one sacrifice, 11 ... hxg5? 12 hxg5 because if the attacked knight moves, White has at least a perpetual check and likely more. In the diagram, the natural 13 ♘e5 invites 13 ... ♕xb2 14 O-O followed perhaps by ♘c4/♗c3. But it is refuted by 13 ... ♗xf2+! 14 ♕xf2 ♕xb2 and Black will be at least one safe pawn ahead. The most appealing alternative is 13 O-O-O. Some computers regard 13 ... ♗xf2 (or 13 ... ♘g4 first) as safe for Black. But GM Alexander Morozevich gave 13 O-O-O a question mark because it allows a strong sacrifice by Black, 13 ... e5!. For example, 14 ♘xe5 ♖e8 15 ♘c4 ♕a6! is fine for Black, as is 14 ♕xe5 ♘g4. White's best in the diagram may be 13 O-O after which 13 ... e5! (14 ♘xe5 ♖e8 15 ♘c4 ♕d8 16 ♕f3 ♗g4 17 ♕xb7 ♖b8) offers compensation. Change of Mind The New Defender takes more risks than his predecessors. But unless he burns his bridges, he can change his mind about how much risk he accepts: Topalov - Kramnik, Novgorod 1997
1 e4 c5 2 ♘f3 ♘c6 3 d4 cxd4 4 ♘xd4 ♘f6 5 ♘c3 d6 6 ♗c4 ♕b6 7 ♘xc6 bxc6 8 O-O
g6 9 e5 dxe5 10 ♕e2 ♕d4 11 ♗e3 ♕d6 12 ♖ad1 ♕c7 13 f4 ♗g4 14 ♕f2 If Black wanted to defend the e-pawn with ... ♕c7 why didn't he do it at the 10th move? Because he wanted to lure White into the tempo-gaining ♖ad1, which allows ... ♗g4 after 13 f4. But in the diagram Black had second thoughts. He looked at 14 ... ♗xd1 and didn't feel comfortable with what he'd face after 15 fxe5! ♕xe5 16 ♗d4. It wasn't too late. He took the cautious way out with 14 ... e4!, limiting the number of open lines. White had nothing better than to try to regain his lost pawn with 15 ♖de1 and Black replied 15 ... ♗f5! 16 h3 h5. White had to swap down to regain his pawn, 17 ♗d4 ♗g7 18 b3 O-O 19 ♗xf6 ♗xf6 20 ♘xe4. After 20 ... ♗xe4! 21 ♖xe4 ♕b6 he accepted Black's draw offer in view of the coming bishops-of-opposite-color ending. As Tal pointed out, the psychology of sacrifice cuts two ways. Yes, taking material forces you to defend. But it also forces your opponent to prove he has compensation. Who, then, is under greater pressure?
1 e4 c5 2 ♘f3 ♘c6 3 d4 cxd4 4 ♘xd4 ♘f6 5 ♘c3 d6 6 g3 ♘xd4 7 ♕xd4 g6 8 ♗b5+
♗d7 9 ♗xd7+ ♕xd7 10 ♗g5 ♗g7 11 ♘d5 White threatens to win a pawn with captures on f6. When this position first occurred, Black either got insufficient compensation for a lost pawn after 11 ... O-O? 12 ♘xf6+ or a poor game positionally after 11 ... e5. So attention turned to 11 ... ♘h5. Now it's White's turn to consider a gambit. The riskless 12 ♕b4 leads to nothing after 12 ... e6!. But if the queen retreats to d3 or d2 instead of b4, can Black safely take on b2? The answer is yes. After 12 ♕d3 ♗xb2! 13 ♖b1 ♗f6 Black prompts a trade of pieces. True, he will face pressure after 14 ♗xf6 ♘xf6 15 ♕d4 or 15 ♕c3. But the onus will be on White to prove he has a pawn's worth of play. In one GM game, 15 ♕c3, which threatens ♘c7+ as well as ♘xf6+, was answered by 15 ... ♖c8! (not 15 ... O-O?? 16 ♕xf6! exf6 17 ♘xf6+ and ♘xd7). Then 16 ♘xf6+ gxf6 17 ♕xf6 regains the pawn. But White has weak pawns that would cost him the initiative, after 17 ... O-O 18 ♕b2 b6 19 O-O ♕c6, for example. White went for 16 ♕xf6 and 16 ... exf6 17 ♘xf6+ ♔e7 18 ♘xd7. But the position became drawish after 18 ... ♖xc2 19 O-O ♔xd7 20 ♖xb7+ ♖c7. Another game went 15 ♕d4 (instead of 15 ♕c3). Black could afford 15 ... b6 and then 16 O-O ♕d8 17 ♖b3 O-O 18 ♘xf6+ gxf6. Black couldn't keep his pawn but after 19 ♖f3 ♖c8 20 ♖xf6 ♖xc2 21 ♖xd6 ♕c8 chances were roughly equal. Black eventually won. In these cases, grabbing a pawn led to a temporary White initiative that quickly turned sour. But Tal's credo raises another question: Is there a cost of not grabbing? When Refusing is Risky Traditional defense warned against a pawn grab that would open files or diagonals leading to your king. That is sound as far as it goes. But that's not far enough. It doesn't take into account the possibility that those lines are going to be forced open, whether you like it or not.
1 e4 c6 2 d4 d5 3 ♘c3 dxe4 4 ♘xe4 ♗f5 5 ♘g3 ♗g6 6 h4 h6 7 ♘f3 ♘d7 8 h5 ♗h7 9
♗d3 ♗xd3 10 ♕xd3 e6 11 ♗f4 ♘gf6 12 O-O-O ♗e7 13 ♘e4 O-O Here 14 g4 has been tried. White plans 15 ♘xf6+ ♘xf6 16 g5! or 15 ... ♗xf6 16 ♖dg1 and 17 g5!. In either case at least half of the g-file is opened and White enjoys good attacking chances. But 14 g4? fell out of favor when it was found that 14 ... ♘xg4! is safe in view of 15 ♖dg1 f5!. For example, 16 ♕b3 ♖f7! 17 ♘d6 ♗xd6 18 ♗xd6 and now 18 ... ♘b6 19 ♕xe6 ♕d7 reaches a nice endgame (20 ♕xd7 ♖xd7 21 ♗g3 ♖e8). In this case, grabbing was safer than ignoring the g-pawn. But suppose White improves with the immediate 14 ♘xf6+! ♘xf6 and only then 15 g4: Once again Black has to evaluate the risk of grabbing - and the risk of not grabbing. Experience has shown that 15 ... ♕a5 is well met by 16 g5! hxg5 17 ♗xg5. White would have a solid attack after 18 ♖dg1 or 18 h6 - even if Black decides to take a pawn on the other wing, 17 ... ♕xa2. Here again the lesser risk comes from 15 ... ♘xg4!. Then on 16 ♖hg1! Black should avoid 16 ... ♘xf2 17 ♕d2! ♘xd1 18 ♗xh6 (18 ... ♗f6 19 ♗xg7 ♗xg7 20 ♕h6). Safety comes from 16 ... f5!. For example, 17 ♕e2 ♔h7 18 ♕xe6 ♕d5 19 ♕xe7 ♕xf3 with equal chances. A defender's best policy may turn out to be a slight sacrifice of his own: Black's last move was ... ♗h3. A bishop trade would: (a) Eliminate White's pressure against his best target, the pawn at b7, (b) Limit White's control of key light squares such as d5 and e4 and allow Black to open the center with ... ♘f6 and ... d5, and (c) Enable Black to mount a kingside attack, such as with ... ♘f6 followed by ... ♕g4-h5, ... ♘g4 and ... ♖af8. White's kingside is vulnerable because its best defensive piece was the now-missing bishop. White appreciated these factors when he played 1 ♗xb7 and 1 ... ♗xf1 2 ♖xf1. This is technically a sacrifice, the Exchange for a pawn. But for a master, it's a no- risk no-brainer. Of course, 1 ♗xb7! is good. A rule of thumb holds that you can't mate a fianchetto king position if you lack a bishop of the same color as the fianchettoed one. After 2 ... ♘f6 3 ♘c3 Black didn't even try with 3 ... ♕h3. Following 4 ♗g2 and h2-h3/♘e4 White would have more than enough protection. Tal's question returns once more. Who has taken a risk? Black's losing chances have soared because of the impending collapse of his queenside after ♗g2/♘c6. On the other hand, his winning chances have risen only slightly. He tried for attack with 3 ... ♔h8 4 ♘e4 ♘g4. But White comfortably created a light-square fortress with 5 ♗d5 ♖f5 6 h3 ♘h6 7 ♔g2 ♖df8 8 f3!. Black's rooks would just become vulnerable after, say, 8 ... ♖h5 9 g4 ♖h4 10 ♕g5! ♕d8 11 ♕xd8 ♖xd8 12 ♔g3!. After 9 g4 he tried 9 ... ♖xh3?! 10 ♔xh3 ♖xf3+ 11 ♖xf3 ♕xg4+ 12 ♔h2 ♕xf3 and should have lost after 13 ♗e6! ♘f5 14 ♗xf5 gxf5 15 ♘g3. Against a good attacker, it will take more than one good decision to navigate the middlegame safely. You may have to evaluate risk at several points. That's what Black faced in this example: Shirov - Timman, Carlsbad 2008
1 d4 ♘f6 2 c4 e6 3 ♘f3 b6 4 g3 ♗a6 5 ♕c2 ♗b7 6 ♗g2 c5 7 d5!? exd5 8 cxd5 ♘xd5
9 O-O ♗e7 10 ♖d1 ♕c8 11 ♗g5 h6
White's gambit came into fashion when it was appreciated that Black can equalize easily after 7 O-O cxd4 8 ♘xd4 ♗xg2. In the diagram White would get some compensation from 12 ♗xe7 ♘xe7 13 e4 followed by ♘c3, ♖d2 and doubling rooks on the d-file. But he opted for the more ambitious 12 ♖xd5. The first point is that 12 ... ♗xd5 13 ♗xe7 ♔xe7 14 ♘c3 would leave Black behind in development and with an insecure king for several moves. Black opted for 12 ... hxg5! instead. He would have a much easier game to play after 13 ♖d2 d5 and still be ahead material. White renewed the offer with 13 ♘c3!. Black realized that defending would be difficult if he had to give up his light-squared bishop for the d5-knight. Play went 13 ... ♘c6 14 ♖ad1 ♘b4 15 ♕e4. Here 15 ... ♘xd5 16 ♘xd5 would virtually force 16 ... ♗xd5 17 ♕xd5 and give White a promising position (17 ... ♕c6 18 ♘e5 ♕xd5 19 ♗xd5). However, White can't withdraw the Exchange offer. Black minimized his risk before taking on d5, with 15 ... ♔f8! and prepared ... ♗f6xc3. Since ... hxg5 was played he didn't need to castle to develop his h8-rook. White tried 16 ♘e5 and Black replied 16 ... ♘xd5 17 ♘xd5 ♗f6. White would still have had compensation after, say, 18 ♕f5, but his pressure was slowly eliminated after 18 ♘c4 ♕c6 19 ♕g4 ♖d8! 20 ♘de3 d5! (21 ♖xd5 ♕c8; 21 ♘xd5 ♕d7) and he lost. Risk-Taking After You've Equalized When you're playing the Black pieces and have gotten through the middlegame unscathed, the position may seem destined to end in a draw. If you want more than a half point, you're going to face a new question: How much risk can you accept to play for win? White's initiative was over and he played 1 ♗xc6. Black could take stock: The natural 1 ... ♕xc6 would give White a very slight edge. Barring a blunder, the most likely result is a draw. If you have to put it in numbers, it might be: an 80 percent of a draw, 12 percent of a White win, 8 percent of a Black win. But the only alternative is 1 ... bxc6!?. Then the c-pawn is a potential target. But so is the b2-pawn. And since White is almost certain to protect his pawn with 2 b3, Black could play 2 ... ♖ed8 and try to make something of his control of the board's only open file. For example, 3 ♖ad1 ♖d5! 4 ♖xd5 cxd5 is a position that favors Black because White's queenside pawns are targets. Maybe it is still an '80 percent draw.' But Black would have the greater of the winning chances. Instead, play went 3 ♖ac1 ♖d5 4 ♕e3 a5 5 ♕c3 ♖ad8. A draw would be even more likely after 6 ♕xc6 ♕xc6 7 ♖xc6 ♖xe5 8 ♔f1!. But White, perhaps convinced that the isolated Black pawns favored him, played 6 h3?. He was mis-evaluating his own risk. There followed 6 ... c5 7 ♖e4 h6 8 ♖c4. White had underestimated the power of the Black rooks after 8 ... ♖d3! 9 ♕e1 ♖8d5 with a threat of ... ♕d7 and ... ♖d1. White should have tried to swap rooks with ♖4c3 at some point but gradually slipped into a position that grew worse and worse: 10 ♔h2 ♕b6 11 ♖1c2 ♕c7 12 ♖a4? ♖d1!. Suddenly White's king was a factor (13 ♕xa5 ♕xe5+ 14 f4 ♕e3). The final act began with 13 ♕c3 ♖xe5! 14 ♕xa5? (rather than 14 ♕g3). The quiet 14 ... ♕d6! set up a devastating discovered check (or 15 ♕a8+ ♔h7 16 ♖a6 ♖h1+! 17 ♔xh1 ♖e1 mate). White resigned after 15 g3 ♔h7 16 ♕a8 ♕d3 17 ♖ac4 ♖d5! in view of a mate after ... ♕f3 or ... ♕f1. We'll consider risk in more detail when we examine sacrifices in the next chapter. But for now let's see what we've learned. Quiz White's attack will be close to decisive if he can play f4-f5. How does Black minimize his risk of losing? Black threatens to blow open the kingside with 1 ... gxh3 or 1 ... h4. The basic weapon of line closing, 1 h4, invites a sacrifice on h4. Should White allow it? Chapter Seven: Sacrifice The only way to refute a sacrifice is to accept it, traditional defense declared. But this rule put defenders at an enormous disadvantage: They took every piece that was thrown at them 'on principle.' One of the best defenders of his era, Amos Burn, famously paid the price in this game: Marshall - Burn, Ostend 1907
1 d4 ♘f6 2 ♘f3 d6 3 ♗f4 ♘bd7 4 e3 g6 5 ♗d3 ♗g7 6 ♘bd2 O-O 7 h4? ♖e8 8 h5
♘xh5! 9 ♖xh5? gxh5 The natural follow-up to White's speculation was 10 ♗xh7+!. Black grabbed the bishop 'on principle' and was mated after 10 ... ♔xh7?? 11 ♘g5+ (11 ... ♔g8 12 ♕xh5 or 11 ... ♔g6 12 ♘df3 e5 13 ♘h4+ ♔f6 14 ♘h7+!). But Black would have had enough material to win after 10 ... ♔f8! (11 ♘g5 ♘f6 12 ♘de4 ♗g4 or 11 ♘h4 e5). Good modern defenders never accept material automatically. They recognize that some sacrifices cannot be refuted and that acceptance can be fatal. When weighing whether to accept, they rely primarily on calculation, common sense and their sense of acceptable risk. Black's last move, ... g6, was designed to keep a White knight off f5 and h5. He can meet the 1 ♗h6 mating threat with 1 ... ♗f6. But White played 1 ♘h5 anyway. Black had to choose between accepting the knight or making an ugly but far-from-fatal concession, 1 ... f6. He was willing to invest time in calculating 1 ... gxh5. It wasn't hard to see that White would reply 2 e5, intending 3 ♕e4 or 3 ♕d3 and a quick mate after ♕xh7+. Clearly 2 ... f5, to block the d3-h7 diagonal, would fail to 3 exf6 ♗xf6 4 ♖xe8+ and ♕xf6. More critical would be 2 ... ♗f8 and then 3 ♕d3 ♗g7. Black might not be able to calculate 4 ♕xh7+ ♔f8 5 ♗h6 to a conclusion. But that would put him out of his comfort zone. He took a deeper look at 2 e5. And he spotted a resource. He can create an escape route for his king and also force matters with 2 ... ♗f6!, a move that White may have overlooked when he considered 1 ♘h5. White had to go ahead with 3 ♕e4 ♖xe5! 4 ♕xh7+. But after 4 ... ♔f8 5 ♗h6+ ♔e7 the e-file was effectively blocked. White tried to force it open with 6 f4 and then 6 ... ♖e6 7 ♗f5 (no better is 7 ♗g6 ♕e8). But 7 ... ♕h8! did the trick. After 8 ♗xe6 ♗xe6! (not 8 ... ♕xh7 9 ♗f5+ and ♗xh7) Black would have two good minor pieces for a rook and would win the 9 ♕xh8 ♖xh8 10 ♗g5 ♗xg5 endgame. White kept his attack alive with 9 ♖xe6+! ♔xe6 10 ♖e1+. But blocking the file, 10 ... ♗e5!, works again because 11 ♕xh8 ♖xh8 12 ♗g5+ f6 is another lost ending. White tried 11 ♕c2. Black consolidated with 11 ... ♕xh6 12 fxe5 ♖c8! 13 exd6+ ♔xd6 14 ♕d3+ ♘d5 and won when the checks ran out. The Vulnerable Sacrificer When a player sacrifices he tries to put his opponent under emotional pressure. But what about the sacrificer? What pressure is he subjected to? To begin with, he has to justify his surrender of material. That may lead to misfires when the sacrifice begins to look dubious. Spassky - Suetin, Soviet Spartakiad 1964
1 d4 d5 2 c4 dxc4 3 ♘f3 ♘f6 4 e3 e6 5 ♗xc4 c5 6 O-O a6 7 ♕e2 b5 8 ♗b3 ♗b7 9
♖d1 ♘bd7 10 ♘c3 ♕c7 11 e4 cxd4 12 e5 dxc3 13 exf6 ♘xf6 14 ♘e5 ♗c5 15 ♗f4 ♕b6 The forcing sequence begun by 12 e5 gave White a lead in development. But he's under pressure to use it. After 16 bxc3 O-O Black would be a safe pawn up. White felt 16 ♘xf7 was the only way to keep his initiative alive. Black quickly saw that 16 ... ♔xf7 would lose to 17 ♖d6!. For example, 17 ... ♗xd6 18 ♕xe6+ ♔f8 18 ♕f7 mate and 18 ... ♔g6 18 ♗c2+ ♔h5 19 ♕h3 mate. Black also understood the power of 16 ... O-O!. Yes, castling is legal. Black is still a pawn ahead but he has dramatically changed the nature of the struggle. His king is safe and he has 17 ... ♘d5, 17 ... ♘e4 and 17 ... cxb2 at his disposal, not to mention 17 ... ♖xf7. White rejected 17 ♘d6 ♗d5 and 17 ♗xe6 ♖xf7 and tried to prepare a more effective capture on e6 with 17 ♘g5?. This was easily handled by 17 ... cxb2! 18 ♖ab1 ♖ae8!. Then captures on e6 have no punch (19 ♘xe6 ♖f7 and 19 ♗xe6+ ♔h8). White limped onward with 19 ♖xb2 ♕c6 20 ♘f3 but Black was already winning after 20 ... ♘e4!. In fact, back at the previous diagram there was a similar scenario: If White had tried 16 bxc3 O-O and then 17 ♘xf7 Black would have gotten a fine game from 17 ... ♘e4 or 17 ... ♘d5. Many sacrifices, like 16 ♘xf7, have hidden weaknesses. They are mistakenly based on the defender accepting the offer - or accepting a second and third follow- up offer. But the defender can say yes, yes - and then no. After White had taken aim at h6 with ♗d2 and ♕c1, Black replied ... ♕a7. Should White retreat the attacked rook from b6? It doesn't look promising for him after 1 ♖b1 ♘xd4. White opted for 1 ♗xh6 and Black called his bluff with 1 ... ♕xb6! 2 ♗xg7 ♔xg7. At first, it looks like White gambled on 3 ♕g5, which is easily handled by 3 ... ♖h8 and 4 ♕f6+ ♔g8. But White had seen further: his second sacrifice, 3 ♘h5+!, would win after 3 ... ♔g8 4 ♕h6. Black had to choose between 3 ... ♔h7 4 ♘g5+ ♔g8 and the acceptance, 3 ... gxh5. The former is hard to calculate after 5 ♘xe6 and 6 ♕h6. The latter is based on 3 ... gxh5 4 ♕g5+ ♔h8? 5 ♕h6+ and mates. Black chose the latter and play went 3 ... gxh5 4 ♕g5+ ♘g6! 5 ♕f6+ ♔g8. White played 6 ♗xg6, hoping for 6 ... fxg6 7 ♕xg6+ But Black shot back 6 ... ♕d8!. Down a rook, White's only resource was more checks: 7 ♗h7+ ♔xh7 8 ♘g5+ ♔g8 9 ♕h6, which gave him two mating threats, ♕h7 and ♘h7-f6+. But the arrival of a reinforcement, 9 ... ♗d3!, was sufficient. White resigned soon after 10 ♖e3 ♕b6! (threatening ... ♕b1+) 11 h3 h4! 12 ♕xh4 ♗g6. The Joys of Pawn Grabbing The philosophy of sacrifice in the 19th century taught that gambits were generally sound because a few extra tempi were worth a pawn. Players like Paul Morphy were even willing to gambit all of their kingside pawns, with 1 e4 e5 2 f4 exf4 3 ♘f3 ♗e7 4 ♗c4 ♗h4+ and 5 g3?! fxg3 6 O-O gxh2+ 7 ♔h1. In the era of New Defense we learned that some gambits - such as the Poisoned Pawn Variation of the Sicilian Defense, 1 e4 c5 2 ♘f3 d6 3 d4 cxd4 4 ♘xd4 ♘f6 5 ♘c3 a6 6 ♗g5 e6 7 f4 ♕b6 and then 8 ♕d2 ♕xb2 - can be safely accepted. Grandmasters predicted that in the 21st century computer analysis would make gambits a thing of the past. They didn't go away. In fact, new gambits arose, including some in queenside openings such as 1 d4 ♘f6 2 c4 e6 3 ♘f3 b6 4 g3 ♗a6 5 ♕c2 ♗b7 6 ♗g2 c5 7 d5!? exd5 8 cxd5 ♘xd5. So where does that leave us? The best conclusion was known in the 19th century: a pawn is usually worth a little trouble. This is particularly true when the defender isn't forced to meet several specific threats. Brinckmann - Nimzovich, Berlin 1927
1 e4 ♘c6 2 d4 d5 3 exd5 ♕xd5 4 ♗e3 e6 5 ♗e2!? ♕xg2! 6 ♗f3 ♕g6 7 ♘e2
If we measure only time and space, White has excellent compensation for a pawn. He will gain more time by harassing the Black queen with moves such as ♖g1. Once he is castled queenside White may be able to profitably blast open the center with d4-d5. But White had no immediate threats. So Black could take time for 7 ... ♘b4! 8 ♘a3 ♘d5. The loss of two tempi was not as important as fixing the problem of the poorly placed knight and forestalling d4-d5. White continued 9 ♘c4 and Black surrendered two more tempi, 9 ... ♕f6! 10 ♘g3 ♕d8, to fix another problem, his misplaced, easily harassed queen. If chess was purely arithmetic, the numerical superiority of White's developed pieces over Black's would be decisive. But there are no exploitable Black weaknesses. White tried 11 ♕d2 ♘gf6 12 ♘e5 c6 13 O-O and Black won without incident following 13 ... ♗d6. Could White improve? Clearly 13 c4?? ♗b4 is out of the question and 13 O-O-O ♗b4 14 c3 ♗d6 and ... ♕a5 is insufficient 'comp.' An earlier try is 9 ♘b5 (instead of 9 ♘c4) and then 9 ... c6 10 ♘f4! ♘xf4 11 ♘c7+ ♔d8 12 ♘xa8 ♘g2+ 13 ♔d2. But Black can play more simply, 9 ... ♘xe3 10 fxe3 ♗d6. If a pawn is worth a little trouble, it's very little here. Many Happy Returns Masters love to grab material - while looking for a favorable way to give it back. They are seeking a kind of indirect trade in which they profit by eliminating weaknesses, gaining time or benefiting in some other way. White has an advantage in space on both wings. With his last move he traded pawns on a5. His goal was to create a pin on the newly-opened file with 1 ♖ab1. Black surprised him with 1 ... ♗xa3!, which he said was "an essential defensive move." On the one hand, he removed the bishop from the danger of f4-f5-f6!. On the other, he prepared to neutralize the queenside pressure with ... ♗b4!. White found nothing better than 2 f5. He eyed 3 f6 gxf6 4 ♗xh6. But 2 ... ♗b4! safeguarded both wings. After 3 ♗xb4 axb4 4 ♖xb4 ♕c7 Black's queen rook is in the game, he threatens ... ♕c5+ and the pawn at c4 is a potential target. White tried 5 ♔h1 and Black was able to win the e-pawn safely, 5 ... exf5 6 ♗xf5 ♗c6 7 ♕d2 (7 ♕c3 ♖a5) ♕xe5. He eventually won. It's usually easier to return a sacrificed pawn in a positional middlegame like that than in a largely tactical one. In attacking situations you're more likely to see a successful return of a sacrificed minor piece. A classic example of that was: Ahues - Carls, Hamburg 1921
1 e4 c6 2 d4 d5 3 exd5 cxd5 4 ♘f3 ♘c6 5 c3 e6 6 ♗d3 ♗d6 7 O-O ♘ge7 8 ♕e2 ♘g6
9 ♘g5 ♘ce7 10 f4 O-O 11 ♕h5 h6 12 ♘xf7 ♔xf7 13 g4 White threatens to regain his knight with 14 f5. Black can avoid that with 13 ... ♔f6, a move only a computer could love. White's calculation was accurate as far as that goes. But he assumed that ripping open the kingside must favor him. Black showed the flaw in his thinking with 13 ... ♕e8! and then 14 f5 exf5 15 gxf5 ♗xf5! 16 ♗xf5 ♔g8!. Black's king is safe and he is ready to seize the attack with 17 ... ♘xf5 18 ♖xf5 ♕e1+. White's best hope may have been 17 ♗e6+ ♔h7 18 ♖xf8. Then Black may like the solid endgame of 18 ... ♘xf8 19 ♕xe8 ♖xe8. But 18 ... ♕xf8 is more promising (19 ♗xd5? ♘xd5 20 ♕xd5 ♖e8 and the attack has changed hands). Instead, White chose to keep his bishop on the b1-h7 diagonal with 17 ♗d3? ♖xf1+ 18 ♔xf1?. After 18 ... ♕f7+ 19 ♔g1 ♖f8: It's easy to predict what happened to White's undermanned king position: 20 ♗e3 ♗f4! 21 ♕e2 ♕f6 22 ♔h1 ♕g5 23 ♗g1 ♗c1! 24 ♗xg6 ♘xg6 White resigned (25 ♘a3 ♘f4). A more subtle case was the next game. Black had a choice of being up the Exchange or one, two - or zero - pawns. The best option, it turned out, was the last. Olafsson - Tal, Bled-Zagreb-Belgrade 1959
1 e4 c5 2 ♘f3 e6 3 d4 cxd4 4 ♘xd4 a6 5 c4 ♘f6 6 ♘c3 ♗b4 7 ♗d3 ♘c6 8 ♘e2 ♕c7
9 O-O ♘e5 10 f4! ♘xc4 11 ♔h1 ♗e7 12 b3 ♘b6 13 e5 ♘fd5 14 ♘e4! f5 15 exf6 ♘xf6
16 ♘2g3 ♘bd5 17 ♗b2! Black saw that 17 ... ♘e3 would not win the Exchange because of 18 ♕c1!. Would White have enough compensation for the sacrificed pawn in the 18 ... ♕xc1 19 ♖fxc1 endgame? Both players believed so because of Black's difficulty developing his queenside and the prospect of ♗e5-d6. Black also had to consider taking a second pawn, 17... ♘xf4. This time it's clearly too risky because of 18 ♖c1 followed by a capture on f6. For example, 18 ... ♕b8 19 ♗xf6! ♗xf6?? loses to the fork, 20 ♖xc8+! ♕xc8 21 ♘d6+. Black would have to retake 19 ... gxf6 but his prospects are dim after 20 ♘h5. Instead, Black went for 17... O-O! 18 ♖c1 ♕d8!, reinforcing f6. The game went 19 ♕e2 b5 20 ♘xf6+ (better was 20 f5!). Black saw through 20 ... ♘xf6? 21 ♗xf6! and 22 ♕e4, hitting h7 and a8. His next big test came after 20 ... ♗xf6 21 ♕h5. Black - who was, after all, Mikhail Tal - didn't have to spend a lot of time to realize that 21... g6 would invite 22 ♗xg6! hxg6 23 ♕xg6+ ♔h8 and then 24 ♘f5! followed by ♖f3! with a deadly attack. The other way to stop 22 ♗xh7+ is 21... h6. Then 22 ♕g6 isn't convinc ing because there is no mate after 22 ... ♗xb2. But White has alternatives such as 22 ♗a3 and 23 ♗e5! (23 ... d6? 24 ♕g6 works now because of 24 ... dxe5 25 fxe5 ♗xe5?? 26 ♕h7 mate). He seemed to have plenty of play for the sacrificed pawn. When there seems to be few alternatives - and all of them are poor - the defender has to broaden his choice. Black must remember that he's a pawn up. That made 21 ... g6 22 ♗xg6 and 22 ... ♕e7! an option. This stops mate on h7 and threatens both 23 ... ♗xb2 and 23 ... hxg6. As a result Black can count on 23 ♗xf6 ♘xf6 and 24 ♕f3 being played. After he replied 24 ... ♖b8 he finally completed development with ... ♗b7. Play went 25 ♗d3 ♗b7 26 ♕e2 ♔h8 27 ♖ce1 ♖be8. Chances would have been equal - no more - after 28 ♘e4. But White thought he was still better and so he chose 28 ♘f5? ♕b4 29 ♕b2 because this was the only way to maintain the initiative (based on 29 ... exf5? 30 ♖xe8). But he underestimated 29 ... ♖c8!. Once again, pieces that were well-placed for attack are clumsy when the attack is over. Black threatens to take the knight. After 30 ♘g3 ♕c3! an endgame would have favored him. Play went 31 ♕e2 ♖g8 32 ♘e4 ♕d4! and Black had turned the tables (33 ♘xf6 ♖xg2!). He won the ending after 33 ♘g5 ♖g7! 34 ♕e3 ♕xe3. Post-Sacrifice The period immediately after a sacrifice is typically the most delicate time for the defender. His opponent has likely calculated a few moves further than him. The situation is almost certain to be one of the easier-for-the-attacker-to-play type. The defender has to set priorities: No. 1 is stopping immediate threats and No. 2 is anticipating longer-term threats. Lombardy - Keres, Mar del Plata 1957
1 d4 ♘f6 2 c4 e6 3 ♘c3 ♗b4 4 e3 b6 5 ♘e2 ♗a6 6 a3 ♗e7 7 ♘f4 d5 8 cxd5 ♗xf1 9
dxe6!? ♗a6 10 exf7+ ♔xf7 White has two pawns for his bishop and Black's king is vulnerable. White need not try to exploit this immediately, with 11 ♕b3+ ♔e8 12 ♘e6. That gains a third pawn but 12 ... ♕d7 13 ♘xg7+ ♔d8 would allow Black to coordinate his forces (e.g. 14 ♘e6+ ♔c8 15 ♗d2 ♘c6 and ... ♘a5). White chose the superior 11 e4!. If he can play e4-e5, then ♕b3+ will have much more punch. White can also just fortify his center with ♗e3, O-O, ♕b3+, ♖ad1 and ♖fe1 while Black is struggling to develop. Black realized he had to put immediate pressure on the White pawns with 11 ... c5!. One of his ideas was to answer 12 e5 with 12 ... ♕xd4! 13 exf6 ♗xf6, returning material advantageously. Another point is that 12 d5 ♘bd7 halts White's progress after 13 d6 ♗f8 or 13 ♘e6 ♕b8 14 f4 ♖e8 and ... ♘f8. White tried to keep control of the situation after 11 ... c5 with 12 ♗e3 ♘c6 13 ♕b3+!. To avoid a powerful 14 ♕a4, Black had to release pressure on the center, 13 ... c4. Then 14 ♕d1 prepared e4-e5! once again. But Black responded with 14 ... ♗d6!, threatening 15 ... ♗xf4. White had nothing better than 15 e5 ♘xe5 16 dxe5 ♗xe5. The give-back strategy has paid big dividends. Black was soon better after 17 ♘fd5 ♖e8 18 ♘xf6 ♕xf6 and won a long endgame. Consolidating The defender's task doesn't end when he survives a sacrificial attack. The position is likely to remain messy for several moves. His pieces need to be reorganized before he can make use of a material advantage. We call this process consolidating. Botvinnik - Stein, Moscow 1964
1 c4 g6 2 ♘c3 ♗g7 3 d4 ♘f6 4 e4 O-O 5 ♗e3 d6 6 f3 b6 7 ♗d3 ♗b7 8 ♘ge2 c5 9 O-O
♘c6 10 ♗c2 e5 11 dxe5 dxe5 12 ♗g5 h6 13 ♗h4 ♘d4 14 ♘d5 ♘xd5?! 15 ♗xd8 ♘e3 16 ♕d3! ♖axd8 17 ♕xe3! ♘xc2 18 ♕c3 ♘xa1 19 ♖xa1 ♗a6 Black's queen sacrifice has yielded only a rook and a bishop. But he has the two bishops, control of the d-file and chances for play with ... f5. White's winning plan is not clear, as 20 b3 h5 and ... ♗h6 followed by ... ♖d2 or ... ♗d2 (21 ♕e3 ♔h7) indicates. White began with 20 ♕c2!, with three ideas. He wants to drive the bishop back with ♕a4. He cleared c3 so his knight can reach d5 and ne gate the power of Black's rooks. And he creates the option of trading rooks with ♖d1. Black prepared to get his KB into the game with 20 ... h5. White didn't like 21 ♖d1? ♖xd1+ 22 ♕xd1 ♗xc4 and chose 21 ♕a4. His best winning chance lies in a creating a passed pawn. That's why Black played 21 ... ♖d2! and invited 22 ♕xa6 ♖xe2 23 ♕xa7? ♖xb2 (24 ♖d1 ♗h6 and ... ♗e3+-d4). White needed to reduce Black's counterplay before he thought about a passed pawn. He accomplished that with 22 ♘c3 ♗c8 23 ♖d1!. Black cannot double rooks (23 ... ♖fd8? 24 ♖xd2 ♖xd2 25 ♕e8+ and ♕xc8). He was near material equality after 23 ... ♖xb2. But his pieces were disorganized after 24 ♘d5!. This was better than 24 ♕xa7 because Black's rook is vulnerable (24 ... a6? 25 ♕a3! ♖c2 26 ♕b3 ♖e2 27 ♔f1! and wins). Black tried 24 ... ♗e6, with the idea of 25 ♕a3 ♗xd5 26 ♕xb2 ♗xc4. Then his two bishops and two extra pawns offer surprising resistance. White chose the more accurate 25 ♕xa7 ♗xd5 26 exd5! to obtain a passed pawn. There was more than one way to win after 26 ... b5 and White decided to run his pawn, 27 d6 bxc4 28 d7. Black's c-pawns offered counterplay with 28 ... c3 so White chose 29 ♕xc5 c2 30 ♖c1 ♖d8 31 ♖xc2 (so that 31 ... ♖xc2 32 ♕xc2 ♖xd7 33 ♕c8+). Black made one last try, 31 ... ♗f8, hoping for 32 ♕c6 ♖xc2 33 ♕xc2 ♖xd7. But White finished off with 32 ♕c8! ♖b8 33 ♕xb8! (33 ... ♖xb8 34 ♖c8). When your material edge is relatively minor, such as an extra pawn (or the Exchange), there is a strong temptation to make it grow, by grabbing a second pawn. Then you're certain you have enough material to win. But king safety and limiting enemy pieces usually takes the priority. Tal - Trifunovic, Havana 1963
1 e4 e5 2 f4 d5 3 exd5 e4 4 d3 ♘f6 5 dxe4 ♘xe4 6 ♗e3 ♕h4+ 7 g3 ♘xg3 8 hxg3?
♕xh1 9 ♕e2 White is preparing a discovered check (or 9 ... ♗e7 10 ♗c5!) as well as the quick development (♘c3, O-O-O, ♗g2). Can Black safely take the d-pawn? Yes. A computer might be happy with 9 ... ♕xd5 10 ♘c3 ♕d8 and 11 ♖d1 ♗d6 12 ♗d4+ ♔f8. Black chose the practical 9 ... ♗b4+!. On 10 ♘c3 he can castle safely, and his extra Exchange must be enough to win. White replied 10 c3 instead. But Black's finesse had denied him the best square for his knight. Black retreated the bishop to a protected square, 10 ... ♗d6. Then came 11 ♗g2, which sets a simple trap (11... ♕h2? 12 ♘f3 ♕xg3+?? 13 ♗f2+). Play went 11 ... ♕h6 12 ♗d4+ ♔d8. The Black king is perfectly safe on d8 since the d-file is blocked. Black's consolidation will involve: (1) Playing ... ♖e8(+) to disorient White's pieces, (2) Mobilizing his queenside pieces with... ♗g4 and ... ♘d7, and (3) Taking squares away from White bishop and (after ♘f3) his knight with ... f6!. Play went 13 ♘f3 ♗g4! 14 ♕f2 ♖e8+ 15 ♔f1 ♘d7 16 ♘bd2 ♕g6 17 ♔g1. White needs a new plan. Among the options: a well-prepared ♘e5, a push of the c-pawn to c5 and c6, and an attack on the queenside pawns from ♘c4-a5 and perhaps ♗xa7 (The immediate ♗xa7 fails to ... ♖xa7 and ... ♗c5+). Black ruled out the first idea with 17 ... f6!. He was ready to thwart oth ers with 18 ... ♕c2. And he could meet 18 ♘c4 with 18 ... ♕d3! followed by ... ♖e2. Then his initiative would be the more forceful one (19 ♘e3 ♗xf3 20 ♗xf3 ♗c5 21 ♖d1 ♕xe3! is a winning liquidation). White fell back on the c3-c4-c5 idea with 18 ♖c1, But Black countered with 18 ... b6 19 b4 a5! and then 20 ♘h4 ♕d3 21 ♘df3 ♖e2. The rest was: 22 ♕f1 axb4 23 ♖d1 ♖xg2+! 24 ♔xg2 ♖xa2+ 25 ♔g1 ♕xf1+ 26 ♔xf1 g5! White resigns. More complex post-sack situations occur when the defender risks not having enough pawns left to win. White's target is h7 but 1 ♖h3 f5 defends easily. Black might even be bet ter after 2 exf6 ♖xf6. White tried to keep matters moving with 1 ♗f5. Of course, 1... gxf5 is punished by 2 ♖g3+. But the main point is that White can shoot for 2 e6 and 2 ♖h3 (2 ... f6 3 ♗xg6). Black brought in a reinforcement, 1 ... ♗c8!. The attack would again be over following 2 ♖h3 f6 3 exf6 ♖xf6 (or 3 ♗xg6? ♗xh3). But White went for broke with 2 e6?, based on 2 ... ♗xe6 3 ♖ae1. The game went 2 ... fxe6 3 ♗xg6 and 3 ... hxg6 4 ♕xg6+ ♕g7 5 ♕h5. He was betting that Black would have no defense to ♖g3(+). But he was surprised by 5 ... ♖f5! 6 ♕h4 ♕f6!, not 6 ... ♖g5? 7 ♖g3! ♖xg3 8 ♕xd8+!. The game wasn't over. Black needed to consolidate after 7 ♖g3+ ♔f8 8 ♕h7 Consolidating is usually a slow process that consists of coordinating your pieces, getting your king to a safer place and offering trades - while meeting end-of-attack threats and retaining enough pawns to win. Here Black must stop ♖g8 mate - but not with 8 ... ♖g5? 9 ♕xa7! ♖xg3 10 fxg3!. That would give White chances for ♖f1 and ♕xb6. Black would be running out of winning pawns. He chose 8 ... ♕f7! and invited 9 ♕h8+ ♔e7 10 ♕h4+ ♔d7 because his king would be getting out of the danger zone. He was happier still when White played 9 ♕h6+ ♔e8 10 ♖g7 and allowed 10 ... ♖h5!, which forced an exchange of queens. True, White got a second pawn for his missing bishop, 11 ♖xf7 ♖xh6 12 ♖xa7. But with queens off the board, Black could coordinate his pieces more easily, 12 ... ♗d7 13 f4 ♖c8, and protected one of the pawns he needed to win, 13 ♖b1 b5!. Bad bishops defend good pawns. White's two extra pawns are slow (14 ♖b3 ♖c4
15 g3 ♔e7 16 h4 ♖h8 and ... ♖hc8 wins, for example).
He made a final gamble, 14 a4 bxa4 15 ♖bb7, which Black handled with 15 ... ♖h7 16 ♖xa4 ♗xa4! 17 ♖xh7 ♖xc3. White still had a pawn for a bishop, and his rook was on the seventh rank. But his pawns are no threat to queen. The game ended with 18 h4 ♗c2! 19 ♖a7 ♗e4 20 ♔h2 ♖c2 21 ♖g7 d4 22 h5 d3 23 h6 d2 White resigns. Brilliancy prizes are rarely awarded for refuting a sacrifice. The de fender has to content himself with putting points on a scoretable. And that should be satisfaction enough. Quiz White has just played ♘g3-f5. How should Black respond? Black threatens to seize the initiative with 1... ♖e2. He can punish 1 ♖e3 with
1... ♗f4!.
With that in mind he chose 1 ♗xg7 What should Black do? Chapter Eight: Prophylaxis Prophylaxis is the most mysterious realm of defense: It typically involves quiet, 'little' moves that don't seem to do much. But when you consider what they stop you appreciate how powerful they can be. This looks like a textbook illustration of a favorable isolated d-pawn middlegame. White owns the c-file and can take his time piling up on the d5-pawn. He threatens 2 ♘f4 followed by ♘xg6 or ♘xd5/♕xe4. Everything is falling into place for him except ... Except that Black's last move was ... ♘f5, which prepared a sacrifice on e3. If White allows 1 ... ♘xe3 2 fxe3 ♖xe3 Black would win with ... ♖xf3 or another killing discovered check. But White's reply changed the position powerfully - even though it was just 1 ♔h1!. Now a sacrifice on e3 would be harmless. And Black would gain nothing from 1 ... ♘h4 2 ♕g3 since a trade of queens magnifies the weakness of the d- pawn. Black chose 1 ... ♕g5 but the reply 2 ♖d1 prepared 3 ♖xd5! ♖xd5 4 ♕xe4. And after 2 ... ♘e7. White increased the pressure with 3 ♖cd2. None of White's last three moves looked strong. But by removing the threat of ... ♘xe3 White made the d-pawn what matters most in the position. Black can't defend it for long in face of ♘f4 or ♕g3 and a trade of queens. He tried 3 ... ♗a5 4 ♖d3 ♘g6 but after 5 ♘g3 he realized that even 5 ... ♖e5 (6 ♗xe5? ♘xe5) would fail in view of 6 e4!. He resigned. Prophylaxis is difficult to appreciate because there is a natural human preference for taking action rather than taking cover. Given a choice between counterplay and prophylaxis, most players lean heavily towards the former. Here's how they can be wrong: This position arises in the Dragon Sicilian. White's last move, h2-h4, advertises his intent to open the kingside with h4-h5xg6, with or without the support of g2- g4. In similar positions, 1 ... b5 is the right idea. Black offers a pawn to open lines and mobilize heavy pieces quickly (2 ♘dxb5 ♕b8 3 ♘d4 ♖fc8 and 4 ♘b3 a5 followed by ... a4). If White doesn't take the b-pawn, Black gets in ... b4 before White can accomplish anything on the kingside. But here 1 ... b5? is dubious as 2 h5! b4 3 ♘d5 shows. White's attack is faster after 3 ... ♘xd5 4 exd5 ♕c7 5 g4, for example (5 ... ♖c8 6 hxg6 fxg6 7 ♕h2 h6 8 ♖d2). And 2 ... ♘xh5 3 g4 ♘f6 4 ♕h2 or 4 b3 has been shown to favor White. The right defense is 1 ... h5!. Black will now have time to activate his heavy pieces (with ♕b8 and ... ♖fc8) without a kingside distraction. The usual downside to moves like 1 ... h5 is that they trade one point of attack at h7 for a more exposed one at h5. But 2 g4, the obvious way to attack the apparent new weakness, fails to 2 ... hxg4! 3 h5 ♘xh5 4 fxg4 ♗xg4 (5 ♖dg1 ♕d7 6 ♖h4 e5). Started with Steinitz Prophylaxis is hardly new. It was recommended by Wilhelm Steinitz when he annotated this consultation game: The Black allies intended 1 ... g4 2 ♗e2 g3, blasting open the White king position. If Black gets in 3 hxg3 ♖xg3, he would win with ... ♕g5. White made a natural attempt, 1 h3, to keep lines closed. But this overlooked the strength of 1 ... g4! 2 hxg4 h5!. Black would win a piece after 3 gxh5 ♖xf3 and would crash through after 3 ♗e2 ♖xf2 or 3 ♕e1 hxg4 (also 3 ... ♖xf3) 4 ♗d1 g3. In the game, the White team tried to minimize the danger with 3 g5 ♖xg5 4 ♔h2. But the attack was decisive after 4 ... ♖h4+ 5 ♔g1 ♕f4! 6 ♖e1 ♖xg2+! (7 ♗xg2 ♕xf2 mate or 7 ♔xg2 ♕h2+ and mates). So was White just lost in the diagram? After all, 1 h3 g4 2 ♗xg4 would also have been bad in view of 2 ... ♖gxg4! 3 hxg4 ♖xf2 ( 4 ♖xf2 ♕xf2+ and mates). No, said Steinitz. White's only vulnerable target was f2 - and losing the f-pawn shouldn't be fatal. What killed him was allowing the checks or possible discovered checks after ... ♖xf2. Steinitz recommended 1 ♔h1! and analyzed 1 ... g4 2 ♗e2. Then 2 ... ♗xf2 can be met by 3 g3!. White is safe after 3 ... ♖xe4 4 ♔g2 or 3 ... ♕h6 4 ♕d3! (but not 4 gxf4? ♗g3). In fact, taking the f-pawn is second best. Black would have greater winning chances after 2 ... ♖xe4. But with bishops of opposite color a win is far off. Curiously, the key move was the same ♔h1, as in the first example of this chapter. It's surprising how often king-to-corner pays off. White prepares ♖ef1 followed by a capture on f7 that would allow his queen to create mating chances around g8. For example, 1 ... ♖c3 2 ♖xc3 ♕xc3 seems to help Black because it trades off an active White rook for a somewhat passive Black one. But then 3 ♖f1 would threaten 4 ♖xf7 ♖xf7 5 ♕xf7+ ♔h7 6 ♕f5+ and mates (6 ... ♔h8 7 ♕f8+ ♔h7 8 ♗g8+). Black's solution was 1 ... ♔h8!. He came to the realization, similar to Steinitz's, that a capture on f7 is only dangerous if it is followed by checks. After the king move, 2 ♖xf7 ♖xf7 3 ♗xf7 lacks punch and Black would win with the 3 ... ♕f2! double attack. Better, but still not good, is 2 ♗xf7 because of 2 ... ♕xe4! when White has the more vulnerable king (3 ♖xe4 ♖c1+). Instead, White played 2 ♖ef1 and found his pieces in a mess after 2 ... ♕e2!. There were no tactics to exploit on f7 so play went 3 h4 ♗f4 and since 4 g3? is foiled by 4 ... ♗xg3 White tried 4 ♕g4 ♖c2. But he had no threats while Black's winning ideas include ... ♖d2-d1. White tried 5 h5 ♖d2 6 ♖xf4 exf4 but soon resigned. And her downfall began with 1 ... ♔h8!. Middlegame Fortress Creating an impregnable fortress is a basic defensive technique in the endgame, as we'll see in Chapter Ten. But prophylaxis can help build a middlegame version of it by ruling out the most aggressive enemy plans. With the center blocked, White turns his attention to the wings. Fortunately, he has a good plan on either one. The first is a queenside break with b2-b4. This would require minimal preparation (♕d2 and ♖ab1, for example). The second plan is g2-g4. It requires more buildup (♕c2, ♘f2, ♔h1, ♖g1). But it offers a bigger payoff by targeting the Black king as well as the e4-pawn. Yet Black was able to foil the first plan and make the second more difficult with one move, 1 ... ♗xc3!. After 2 bxc3 ♘f6: Clearly b2-b4 is impossible and White has no exploitable queenside target. On the other wing, Black can pile up heavy pieces on the g-file and make g2-g4 difficult, if not impossible. Play went 3 a4 ♔h8 4 ♘f2 ♖g8 5 ♔h1 ♕e8 6 ♖g1 ♕g6. If White had tried to hurry the g-pawn push with 7 h3 Black could simply block him with 7 ... ♕g3. White needed several more moves. The result was 7 ♕d2 ♗d7 8 g3 ♖ae8 9 a5 ♖e7! 10 ♖ab1 ♗c8 11 ♖g2 ♖eg7 12 ♖bg1 ♘ce8 13 h3 h5. White cannot increase his support for g3-g4 beyond ♕d1 (which isn't enough). Black had built an iron-clad fortress. The players agreed to a draw here. Prophylaxis and Counterplay Aron Nimzovich elaborated on the uses of prophylaxis in the 1920s. However, the emphasis then and for the decades to come was on safety for the sake of safety. It was the ounce of prevention to avoid needing a pound of cure. Prophylaxis was considered an alternative to counterplay. New Defense changes the focus: Prophylaxis can be the necessary preparation for counterplay. Anand - Ivanchuk, Leon 2008

His 14th move anticipated lines in which the center is opened and Black delivers a key check on the open g1-a7 diagonal. These are common prophylactic moves in the Sicilian Defense. Black also took a prophylactic step, ... ♖ad8 to deter e4-e5. For example, 15 e5 dxe5 16 fxe5? ♖xd4. In the diagram, he played 18 ... ♔h8!. That prevented ♗h6. But it also prepared ... d5. The push wouldn't work immediately, 18 ... d5? 19 exd5 ♘xd5? 20 ♘xd5 ♗xd5 21 f6 or 21 ♗h6 ♗f6 22 ♗xg7 ♗xg7 23 f6. White tried to exploit the king's new position with 19 ♗g5, hoping for ♕h4, ♖e3-h3 and then ♗xf6/♕xh7 mate. For example, 19 ... ♗c6 20 ♕h4 ♕b7 readies 21 ... a5 and 22 ... b4. But 22 ♖e3 makes 23 ♖h3 strong. Black was happy to trade dark-squared bishops, 19 ... ♘h5! 20 ♕h4 ♗xg5 21 ♕xg5 ♘f6, because it put him on the verge of counterplay with ... d5 (or ... a5 and ... b4 first). Play went 22 ♖f3 ♕c5 23 ♖g3 ♖g8. The kingside is secure and Black, with a powerfully placed queen, is at least equal. After 24 ♖h3 he could have broken in the center with 24 ... d5 25 exd5 ♗xd5 (not 25... ♘xd5?? 26 ♖xh7+! ♔xh7 27 ♕h5 mate). He preferred 24 ... b4 25 axb4 ♕xb4 26 ♖b1 ♖c7 and won after ... d5. But what would happen in a similar position if there is no prospect of counterplay? The defender can wait with prophylactic measures: It's tempting to open the a-file with ... a5 and a trade of pawns on b4. But Black doesn't have much play on the file then after ... ♖a8 - and he has made his b5- pawn a potential target. Even though there was no immediate danger of ♘f6+, Black took the precaution of 1 ... ♔h8. After 2 c3 he added 2 ... ♖g8!. With his rook defending g7 he can decide, after ♘d6, whether to play ... ♗xd6. Then exd6 would threaten the Black queen but not ♕xg7 mate. After 3 ♖d3 Black decided to anticipate ♘d6 in another way, with the curious- looking 3 ... ♖cf8. This rules out ♘xf7+. 4 ♔h1 ♕b7. Black was not threatening anything. His waiting was rewarded by 5 ♕g4?. White prepared 6 ♗d1 followed by ♖h3 and ♗c2. But now the pent-up power of Black's kingside pieces made 5 ... ♘xe5! 6 ♗xe5 f5 work. White's position collapsed in a few moves, 7 ♘c5 fxg4 8 ♘xb7 gxf3 9 ♘a5 fxg2+ 10 ♔g1 ♗d5! 11 ♖xd5!? exd5 12 ♔xg2 ♗f6, and he resigned. Anticipation Prophylaxis is basically the anticipating of threats before they are threats. One reason that Tigran Petrosian was such a great defender is that he visualized threats before they occurred to his opponents. Bisguier - Petrosian, USA-USSR match 1954
1 d4 ♘f6 2 c4 c5 3 ♘f3 cxd4 4 ♘xd4 ♘c6 5 ♘c3 e6 6 g3 ♗c5 7 ♘b3 ♗e7 8 ♗g2 0-
0 9 O-O d6 10 e4 ♘e5 11 ♕e2 ♕c7 12 ♘d2 a6 13 b3 b5 14 f4 ♘c6 15 ♗b2 White can seek play in the center, with the aim of e4-e5, or on the kingside with g3-g4-g5 followed by f4-f5-f6. Black would gain little from 15 ... bxc4 16 ♘xc4 because then White can favorably turn his sights to the other wing, with ♖ac1. With that in mind, Black chose 15 ... b4!. If the attacked knight goes to a4 it would be out of play for quite some time. White preferred 16 ♘d1. Then 16 ... a5 17 ♘e3 a4 allowed Black to open the a-file, 18 ♖ab1 axb3 19 axb3 ♖a2. But his queenside initiative had temporarily come to an end. White began kingside operations with 20 g4. Black anticipated him with 20 ... ♘d7!. He can reorganize his kingside with ... ♖e8 and ... ♗f8 well before they are necessary. For example, 21 g5 could be met by 21 ... ♘c5 22 h4 ♖e8 23 f5 ♘e5 24 f6 ♗f8, for example, with a rock-solid position. He preferred 21 ... ♖e8 and then 22 ♔h1 ♘c5 23 h4 ♕d8. What is the queen doing on d8? It is there to prevent a pawn push to f6. But it also anticipates that he will strike in the center with ... e5! and doesn't want to allow ♘d5 with tempo. White didn't like 24 f5 ♘e5 (25 ♗xe5 dxe5 26 ♖fd1 ♕d4). He switched to a new plan, the preparation of g5-g6 by means of ♖f3-g3 and h4-h5. 24 ♖f3 ♗f8 25 ♖g3. Thanks to his preparations Black was ready for 25 ... e5! 26 f5 ♘d4!. White would be losing after 27 ♗xd4 exd4 28 ♘d5 ♗xf5 or 27 ♕d1 ♘d3!. He gave up a pawn under better circumstances, 27 ♕f1 ♘dxb3 28 ♘xb3 ♘xb3 29 ♕e1. He would have gotten some play after 29 ... ♕a5 30 ♘d5. But Black converted the extra pawn to piece activity: 29 ... ♘c5! 30 ♕xb4 ♗b7 31 ♘d5 ♖a4 32 ♕d2 (or 32 ♕c3 ♗a6 33 ♘e3 ♕b8 and ... ♖b4). He won soon after 32 ... ♗xd5! 33 ♕xd5 ♖b4! 34 ♗f3 ♕a8 35 ♕d2 ♕b7 36 ♖g2 ♖b8. As we've seen before, White's aggressively placed pieces were poor defenders when his threats or initiative ended. Here's another case. White shifted his knights to the kingside and prepared ♖g3, which would threaten ♘f6+ or ♘xh6+. If it were his move, 1 ♖g3 would favor him after 1 ... ♗xg4 2 ♕xg4 g6 3 f4 and 1 ... ♘g6 2 ♘xg6. But it just takes two precautions, 1 ... ♔h7! followed by ... ♘g8!, to defang the dangers. After 2 ♖g3 ♘g8 White discovered that his pieces were misplaced: Black threatens ... ♕xh4, and the natural 3 ♘f5? allows a knight to be trapped after 3 ... g6! 4 ♘fe3 h5!. Winning a piece that way may seem too risky. But here, because of Black's first two moves, it is perfectly safe. Instead, White retreated 3 ♘f3. Black seized the initiative with 3 ... ♗xg4! 4 ♖xg4 ♘f6 5 ♖h4 ♔g8 6 ♖h3 d5!. Now the biggest difference between White and Black is that the rook is offside at h3. As a result, White can't easily deal with the opening of the center. He made one last bid for attack, 7 ♕e2 ♕d7 8 ♘h4 dxe4 9 dxe4 ♖ad8 10 ♘f5. Then he threatened 11 ♖g3 and prepared 12 ♕f3 followed by ♘xh6+. But Black's pieces proved superior after 10 ... ♕d2! 11 ♕f3 ♖e6!. His rook defended f6 and his queen watched h6. Black headed to a winning endgame after 12 ♖g3 g6 13 ♖f1 ♕f4! (not 13 ... ♕xb2 14 ♕e3!). White still had tricks, 14 ♖d1 ♖ee8 15 ♘e7+. But they were foiled by 15 ... ♔g7 16 ♘d5 ♕xf3 and he lost the endgame after 17 ♖xf3 c6 18 ♘e3 ♖xd1+ 19 ♘xd1 ♖d8 20 ♘e3 ♘xe4. Counter-Intuitive It is relatively easy to find aggressive, forcing moves. They readily occur to the improving player. Prophylactic moves don't. To find them you have to put yourself in your opponent's chair and see what he wants to do. White has more space and more active pieces. But he needs one more piece to make things happen on the kingside. The only one not helping out is the rook at a1. However, when White thinks about 1 O-O-O he realizes the danger from 1 ... b4!. Then Black would have the target he desperately needs. By thinking prophylactically, White found 1 ♔e2!, He had safeguarded his king and prepared ♖ah1-h8 in the safest manner. 1 ... ♖c8 2 ♖ah1! ♘xd3 3 ♕xd3 ♖c4? 4 ♖h8!. White's heavy pieces invaded - 4 ... ♖xh8 5 ♖xh8+ ♔e7 6 ♕h7! with a threat of ♕h4+ and mates. The end was 6 ... ♗e8 7 ♕g8 ♖c8 8 f5! resigns in view of fxe6, e.g. 8 ... exf5 9 ♕f8+ ♔d7 10 e6+ ♔c7 11 ♕e7+ or 10 ... fxe6 11 ♖h7+. Another reason prophylaxis is counter-intuitive is that it seems to lose time: Jakovenko - Karjakin, Sochi 2012 1 ♘f3 ♘f6 2 c4 b6 3 g3 c5 4 ♗g2 ♗b7 5 O-O g6 6 ♘c3 ♗g7 7 d4 cxd4 8 ♕xd4 d6 9 ♖d1 ♘bd7 10 ♗e3 ♖c8 11 ♖ac1 a6 12 b3 O-O 13 ♕h4 Black played 13 ... ♖c7 for two reasons. One is aggressive. He wants to play ... ♕a8 and ... ♖fc8 so that ... b5 will be strong. The other reason is defensive. He anticipated ♗h3, which would pin the d7-knight if the rook still stood at c8. The picture changed when White replied 14 g4. Black recalled how he played 14 ... ♖c8!? and another of the elite GMs in the tournament "looked at me like I was a complete idiot." Black's play was again prophylactic. He knew that g4-g5 might be coming and, after he answered it with ... ♘h5, he didn't want ♘d5 to attack the c7-rook. White replied 15 ♗h3. It might seem that Black has just wasted two tempi and White used the time to make good moves, ♗h3 and g3-g4. But those moves didn't look useful after Black shot back 15 ... b5! 16 cxb5 ♕a5 and threatened 17 ... ♖xc3 (and 18 ♗d2 ♖xc1 19 ♗xa5 ♖xd1+). If White didn't have his extra moves, 17 bxa6 would be fine. But here Black would have had excellent compensation for a pawn after 17 ... ♗xf3 18 exf3 ♘e5 or
18 g5 ♖xc3 19 exf3 ♘d5! (and 20 ♗xd7 ♘xe3 21 fxe3 ♖xc1 22 ♖xc1 ♕xa6).
The game went 17 ♗d2 ♗xf3 18 exf3 axb5 19 g5 b4! and Black had the better of the complications (20 gxf6 ♗xf6 21 ♕e4 bxc3 22 ♗xd7 ♖cd8 23 ♗xc3 ♗xc3 24 ♕xe7 d5). And a third reason that prophylactic moves are counter-intuitive is that they often seem to overprotect the already well-protected. Black chose 1 ... ♖e6, with ... ♕c7 and ... ♖ae8 in mind. But the e-file is closed. What would the rooks do on e6 and e8? Well, Black first had to deal with an immediate threat (2 ♘h6+ gxh6 3 ♗xf6). He also had to face a longer-term threat, ♖ad1 and d3-d4!, which could embarrass his queen at d8. The wisdom of his maneuvers was clear after 2 ♕g3 ♕c7 3 ♖ad1 ♖ae8 4 axb5 axb5. He was ready to play for an edge with ... d4 and/or ... c4. White continued with his plan, 5 d4?, perhaps expecting 5 ... ♘xe4 6 ♗xe4 dxe4 7 d5!, which favors him. But Black improved with 5 ... dxe4. 6 ♗xf6 ♖xf6 7 ♗xe4 ♗xe4 8 ♖xe4. White had overlooked 8 ... ♕c8! and the threat of ... ♖xf5. The f5-knight has no good retreat (9 ♘e3 ♖f4!). He would be losing after 9 ♘xg6 ♕xf5! or 9 ♕g4 ♘xh4 10 ♘xh4 ♕xg4 11 ♖xg4 exd4 12 cxd4 c4!. In the end he played 9 dxe5 and 9 ... ♖xf5 10 ♘xf5 ♕xf5 11 ♖de1. But the minor pieces prevailed after 11 ... ♖d8 12 ♕e3 c4 13 e6 fxe6 14 ♖xe6 ♗c5 15 ♖e8+ ♔f7. Sacrificial Prophylaxis Finally, it should be noted that not all prophylactic moves are quiet. Some are dramatic because they give up material. White has positional trumps, including two potential passed queenside pawns that could be decisive. But he has to deal with ... h4, which would blow open his king position. The short-term response, 1 ♕f2, seems adequate. But after 1 ... f5 Black's counterplay from 2 ... h4 3 gxh4 ♕h6 and ... f4, or from ... ♖f6-h6, is beginning to get serious. White found a long-term solution in 1 ♖f4! and 1 ... ♗xf4 2 gxf4. This keeps his kingside firm and makes his knight a powerhouse when it goes to d4. True, Black still had an h-pawn to push and did: 2 ... ♕g6 3 ♘d4 h4 4 ♔h1 h3. It appeared as if White's sacrifice had failed when 4 ♗f1 ♗g4 made ... ♗f3+ a threat. Yet White had another prophylactic measure, 5 ♔g1! followed by ♔f2. There followed 5 ... ♗e2+ 6 ♔f2 ♗xf1 7 ♖xf1 ♖fc8 8 ♖g1 ♕f6 9 ♕c3. White has all the play (♖g5, ♕b3, b4-b5). He eventually won three pawns and coasted to victory. You can defend many, if not most, positions without prophylaxis. But to become a complete defender, to get the most out of the wide variety of situations you'll find yourself in, it pays to learn what prophylaxis can do for you. Quiz Black's position looks dire in view of ♗xf6/♕xh7 mate. What can he do? White has been preparing e4-e5!. How can Black anticipate that? White's plan is ♗xf6 and g2-g4-g5. Do any ideas occur to you? Chapter Nine: You Against Tal Decades after his death, Mikhail Tal remains the iconic ideal of the all-out aggressive player, the attacker against whom all others can be measured. But his sacrifices didn't automatically succeed. Nor did his initiatives always translate into brilliancy prizes. He was beaten by good defense. Let's see what Tal's games can teach us about the limits of attack. In this chapter we'll put you in the chair of his opponents. Can you defend against Tal? Tal - Romanishin, Riga 1981

♕xd4 b5 9 ♖d1 ♗b7 10 O-O ♘c6 11 ♕d2 ♗e7 12 ♗f4 ♖c8 13 ♖fe1 ♘a5 14 ♗d6! ♗xd6 15 ♕xd6 ♕c7 16 ♕a3 ♘c4 17 ♗xc4 ♕xc4 White met the threat of 18 ... b4 with his own threat, 18 ♘d5, of mate on e7. Do you accept the knight sacrifice or refuse? And if you refuse, how? Take a few minutes to figure out a response before reading on. The first thing you may have noticed is that after 18 ... exd5 19 exd5+ ♔d8 White has a major choice. He can grab a second pawn (or a third) with 20 ♕e7+ ♔c7 21 ♕xf7. But then his threats are dwindling and he will have a hard time making his compensation count. On the other hand, White can stop Black's king from escaping to c7 with either 20 ♕g3 or 20 d6 (with its threat of 21 ♕a5+). The outcome would be unclear. In the game, Black let Tal take the risks. He played 18 ... ♕c5!. That gave Tal a chance to be consistently aggressive - and get the worst of it with 19 b4? ♕xc2!. For example, 20 ♖c1 ♕d2 or 20 ♕g3 ♗xd5! 21 exd5 O-O or 21 ♕xg7 ♕c3!. Tal appreciated that the 19 ♕xc5 endgame would be fine for Black. To keep his attacking hopes alive he tried 19 ♕g3. He invited 19 ... exd5 20 ♕xg7! followed by exd5+. But once again Black was able to shift the burden back to White, with 19 ... ♗xd5!. He dared Tal to play 20 ♕xg7? ♕f8! 21 ♕xf8+ ♖xf8 because 22 exd5 ♖xc2 favors Black. Tal saw the light, recaptured 20 exd5 - and offered a draw. It was accepted because the position is balanced after 20 ... O-O 21 c3. Another way to deal with an attack-mad opponent is to take super-precautions. Don't give a Tal the chance to play like a Tal. Tal - Andersson, Las Palmas 1975
1 e4 c5 2 ♘f3 d6 3 d4 cxd4 4 ♘xd4 ♘f6 5 ♘c3 e6 6 ♗e2 a6 7 O-O ♗e7 8 f4 ♕c7 9
♗e3 O-O 10 ♕e1 ♘c6 11 ♕g3 ♘xd4 12 ♗xd4 b5 13 a3 ♗b7 14 ♖ae1 ♗c6 15 ♔h1 ♖ab8 16 e5! ♘e8 17 ♗d3 White would get a small positional edge from 17 ... b4 18 axb4 ♖xb4 19 ♘e2. But 18 ♕h3! is far more promising. Then 18 ... h6 19 ♘e4 prepares ♘f6+. And 18 ... g6 19 ♖e3! bxc3? 20 exd6 ♗xd6 21 ♕xh7+! ♔xh7 22 ♖h3+ is a mate. Black played 17 ... g6! (instead of 17 ... b4) so his knight can go to g7. He didn't fear 18 f5 exf5 19 ♗xf5 because of 19 ... dxe5 20 ♗xe5 ♗d6!. True, White has good alternatives to 18 f5, such as 18 ♘e4 or 18 exd6 ♗xd6 (18 ... ♘xd6? 19 f5! exf5 20 ♕e5! wins) 19 ♕h4. But the biggest drawback to 17 ... g6 is that it made h7 more vulnerable to ♕h3- h6/♖e3-h3. Tal went for the quick knockout with 18 ♕h3 and 18 ... ♘g7 19 ♕h6. White threatens to win immediately with 20 exd6 followed by ♕xg7 mate or dxc7. If that is thwarted, he also has 20 ♖e3 and ♖h3. What would you do as Black? Take a few minutes. The best defense turns out to be bunkering down with the highly cautious 19 ... f6! 20 ♖e3 ♖f7!. He protected g7 and prepared ... ♗f8 followed by ... ♘f5 or ... ♘h5. By adding this over-protection he could refute 21 ♖h3 ♘h5 22 ♖xh5? with 22 ... ♗f8!. The effect on Tal was crucial. He could have kept an edge (after 21 ♖h3 ♘h5) with 22 exf6! ♗xf6 23 ♗xf6 ♘xf6 24 ♗xg6! (24 ... ♖g7 25 ♘e4!). However, Tal was intrigued by a pretty move, 21 f5. It works wonderfully after 21 ... exf5 22 e6! ♖ff8 23 ♖h3 ♘h5 and now 24 ♖xf5!. Also winning is 21 ... fxe5 22 fxg6 ♖xf1+ 23 ♗xf1 hxg6 and now 24 ♗d3! exd4 25 ♖h3. But it doesn't matter how many pretty ways to lose there are if there is one line that successfully defends. Black found 21 ... ♘xf5!. This turned the tables. Play went 22 ♗xf5 exf5! 23 e6 ♖g7 24 ♘e2 and a draw was agreed - but 24 ... ♗e4! would have given Black strong winning chances. Choice of Weapons The defensive weapons we examined in Chapter Four occur over and over in Tal's games. Which weapon occurs to you in the next position? With five pieces aimed at the Black kingside, White looked for a way to sacrifice on h6 or g7. This time super-caution can be dangerous: If Black overprotects h6 with 1 ... ♘g8, for example, he allows 2 ♘xh6! ♘xh6 3 ♗xh6 gxh6? 4 ♕xf7+ or 3 ... ♕xh4 4 ♗g5 and 3 ... ♔xh6 4 ♘f5+. Black's solution was long-distance reinforcement, 1 ... ♖a6!. The rook protects the f6-knight in key lines. It also frees a8 for Black's queen, which can take aim at e4 and provide counterplay. White pulled the trigger with 2 ♘xh6 gxh6 3 ♘f5. His idea was 4 ♘xh6 ♗xh6 5 ♕f5+ ♔h8 6 ♗xh6 followed by ♗g7+ (if allowed) or ♗g5. That might win if he can also get his other rook or bishop into the game after f2-f4. Black carried out his regrouping with 3 ... ♕a8! and threatened 4 ... cxd3 5 ♗xd3 ♗xe4! to kill the attack. Play went 4 ♘xh6 ♗xh6 5 ♕f5+ ♔h8 6 ♗xh6 ♖g8 7 ♗g5. Now we can appreciate how the rook at a6 defends f6. But Black can't play 7 ... cxd3 8 ♗xd3 ♗xe4 because of 9 ♗xe4 ♕xe4 10 ♗xf6+! ♘xf6 11 ♖xg8+ ♔xg8 12 ♕c8+! and ♕xa6. Black could have over-protected further with 7 ... ♖g6 but White would pick up a third pawn for the piece after 8 ♗xf6+ (8 ... ♖axf6? 9 ♕xd7). And 7 ... ♖xg5 would give away his material edge. Black found 7 ... ♕e8!, which protects d7 and f7 and prepares to trade pieces with 8 ... ♘h7!. White tried 8 f4 ♘h7! 9 ♗h4 ♖xg3 10 ♗xg3. But Black's pieces took over the board, 10 ... ♖f6! 11 ♕g4 ♖g6 12 ♕h4 exf4 13 ♕xf4 f6!. He won after 14 ♗f2 cxd3 15 ♗xd3 ♘e5! 16 ♗f1 ♘g5 17 ♔h1 ♘xe4. White's weapons were good. Black's were better. Most Exciting Draw Tal's finest draw - and what's been called the most exciting draw ever played - featured a remarkable insight by the defender. His opponent had to figure out what was the indispensable member of Tal's attacking army and get rid of it. He passed the test. Can you? Both ... ♖xd3 and ... ♗xd1 are threatened. Tal blithely ignored both with 1 hxg6!. The first question Black must answer is whether he can allow gxf7+ or gxh7+. He figured out that 1 ... ♖xd3! was safe because 2 gxf7+ ♕xf7! wins for Black. And 2 gxh7+ ♔h8 3 ♖xd3 is simply met by 3 ... ♗e6. White recaptured 2 ♖xd3! and was ready to beat 2 ... ♖d8 with 3 gxh7+! ♔h8 4 ♘f7+!. Black found the correct 2 ... hxg6! and White revealed the point of his queen sacrifice with 3 ♖h7!. The real threat is 4 f3!, of all things. Then if the attacked bishop retreats to h5, White wins with 5 ♖d7 and 6 ♖dxf7. If, instead, the bishop goes the other way, say to e6, White has 5 ♖d2 and 6 ♖dh2 followed by mate on h8. The natural responses of a defender in a position like this are (a) panic and (b) confusion, followed by (c) trying to trade off one of the rooks. If (c) fails, he is left with (d), giving back some material. But 3 ... ♖d8? loses to the pretty 4 ♖xd8 ♕xd8 5 ♖h8+! ♔xh8 6 ♘xf7+ and ♘xd8. And the giveback option, 3 ... ♖e6 4 ♘xe6 ♗xe6, would allow 5 ♖g7+ and ♖d1-h1+ or 4 ... fxe6 5 ♖g7+ ♔h8 6 ♖dd7 ♕xf6 7 ♖gf7!. But there is also option (e). Black can look for a key element to White's attacking force and eliminate it. Can you spot it? Take a few minutes. Black realized that it was the pawn at f6. That told him he had to find a safe way (not 3 ... ♖e6?) to get rid of it. He found 3 ... ♖c8! 4 f3 ♖c6!. Tal saw that 5 fxg4 ♖xf6 would favor Black. He bailed out with 5 ♖xf7 and a draw was agreed soon after 5 ... ♕xf7 6 ♘xf7 ♔xf7 7 fxg4 ♔xf6. Over-Reaching Tal's ingenuity required defenders to thread their way through a ticket of traps, as Black did in the last example. The defender's reward for navigating his way to safety was that Tal occasionally over-reached. Tal - Bhend, Zurich 1959

But 21 ... ♗xd5? 22 ♗xd5+ ♔h8 23 ♖e7 helps White. What else should you consider as Black? In the absence of counterplay, prophylaxis, 21 ... ♔h8!, stands out. White was threatening 22 ♘e7+ ♔h8 23 ♗xg6 or 22 ♗xg6 hxg6 23 ♘e7+. Also, since ... ♗xd5 may be inevitable, Black wanted to make sure that ♗xd5 would not be check. For example, 22 ♖e3 could be met by 22 ... ♗xd5 23 ♗xd5 ♖be8!. Then with bishops of opposite color, Black's target at f2 is as least as vulnerable as White's at h7 (and 24 ♖h3 ♗d4 25 ♕xg6 fails to 25 ... ♕xh3!). Tal accepted the challenge and played 22 ♗xg6 anyway, because 22 ... hxg6 23 ♘e7! still wins (23 ... ♖f5 24 ♕h4+ ♖h5 25 ♘xg6+). Black's timely 21st move allowed him to answer 22 ♗xg6 with 22 ... ♗xd5!. The first point is that 23 cxd5 or 23 ♕xd5 allows Black to pocket a piece safely (23 ... hxg6). But the more subtle second point is that 23 ♕h5 also fails, to 23 ... ♗g8!. Did Tal just miss that retreat when he sacrificed the bishop? No, he calculated quite a bit further. This became apparent after 23 ♖e7!. Then 23 ... ♗f6? allows White to swap down to a favorable endgame (24 ♕xf6+ or 24 ♖xd7 ♗xg5 25 ♖xh7+ and 26 cxd5). Also 23 ... ♕c8?? fails to, among other moves, 24 ♗f5!. But 23 ... ♕d8! pins the e7-rook. Black can meet 24 ♗xh7? and the threat of ♕xg7 mate with 24 ... ♗f6! 25 ♕h6 ♕xe7 and wins (26 ♗e4+ ♔g8 27 ♗d5+ ♖f7). Black has passed three tests so far. But Tal posed a fourth with 24 ♖fe1!. Now on 24 ... ♗g8 White wins with 25 ♗xh7!. And against 24 ... ♖g8 he has 25 ♕h6! ♗xh6 26 ♖xh7 mate. Black had to be impressed by that. But remember that the rook at e7 is pinned. Take a few minutes to consider Black's options. He can't defend with 24 ... ♖b7 (25 ♖xb7?? ♕xg5) because White has 25 ♕h5 ♗g8 26 ♖xb7. Black found a way to exploit the pin: 24 ... ♗f7! so that 25 ♗xf7 ♖xf7. This prepares to kill the attack with 26 ... ♖xe7 27 ♖xe7 ♕f8. Note that 26 ♖e8+ ♕xe8 27 ♖xe8+ ♖xe8 would give Black more than enough material for the queen. In this calculation contest, Tal erred first. He could have held the position with the unlikely 25 ♗h5! because then 25 ... ♖b7? can be met by 26 ♗xf7 ♖xf7? 27 ♖e8+!. After 25 ♗h5 Black can draw - but just draw - with 25 ... ♗d4 26 ♕h6! ♗g7! 27 ♕g5 ♗d4. Instead, White played 25 ♗c2? and there followed 25 ... ♖b7! 26 h4 ♖xe7 27 ♖xe7. White's queen is protected now, so he threatens 28 ♖xf7 ♕xg5 29 ♖xf8+ or 28 ... ♖xf7 29 ♕xd8+. Black has to pass one final test. There are two defenses. The simplest is 27 ... ♗g6, again exploiting the pin and trading off another piece. This would require Black to win the endgame after 28 ♗xg6 hxg6 29 ♖xa7. Black preferred to think out 27 ... h6!. The attack ended after 28 ♕f5 ♗g8! and Black's extra piece won (29 ♕e4 d5 30 cxd5 ♕xd5 31 ♕g6 ♕d4 32 ♕g3 ♖f7!). Accept or Not? When trying to decide whether to accept a sacrifice it pays to recall that there are positions that are more difficult for the attacker to play than for the defender. That helped defeat Tal in this game. Polugayevsky - Tal, Moscow 1973

♘xe5 ♕e7 9 f4 ♘bd7 10 ♘xd7 ♗xd7 11 e5 White grabbed the e-pawn because he saw that if Black tried to win a pawn back, 8 ... ♕d4, he could be punished by 9 ♘d3! ♘xe4 10 ♕e2!. The position in the diagram is risky for White - yet difficult to play as Black because he has three appealing alternatives, 11 ... g5, 11 ... ♘h5 and 11 ... O-O-O. The first one looks good after 12 fxg5 ♘g4!. But the simple 12 ♗e2 would force a knight retreat and send Black's initiative floundering. The ... g5 idea works much better after 11 ... ♘h5! 12 ♕f3 ♗c6 and 13 ♕f2 g5!. White could improve with 13 ♕g4 but 13 ... ♗d7 would repeat the position and 13 ... ♕c5 and ... ♕e3(+) might offer more than a draw. Tal chose 11 ... O-O-O and that could be considered his first error of the game, although a minor one. Take a moment here to imagine what you would play as White. His task is actually easier than Black's. In view of the possibility of 12 ... ♘h5, 12 ... ♖he8 and other dangerous ideas, White's reply was virtually forced. Did you find 12 ♗e2 ? Good. Then if Black retreats 12 ... ♘e8 White must stand well after 13 ♕b3 (13 ... ♗c6 14 ♗f3!). A bit trickier is 12 ... ♘h5! because 13 ♗xh5 gxh5 14 ♕xh5 ♖hg8 gives Black good play. But White doesn't need the second pawn and would have the upper hand after just 14 O-O!. Black again had the more difficult task and 12 ... ♗c6? was second best. It helped White by narrowing his choices. White saw he could either defend against ... ♗xg2 or take the knight on f6. He also saw that he would have a hard defense after 13 ♗f3 ♘e4 14 ♗xe4 ♗xe4 (15 O-O ♕b4). So he might as well devote his calculation to 13 exf6!. It wasn't hard to see that the best response would be 13 ... ♕e3!. White's moves are easy to find when you can rule out the losing alternatives (14 ♕b3? ♕xd2+; 14 ♘f1? ♖xd1+; 14 ♔f1 ♖xd2 and 14 ♕c1? ♖he8). That left 14 ♖f1! and then 14 ... ♗xg2 15 ♖f2. The threat of ♖xg2 gave White time to take a breath and study the position after 15 ... ♗h3. It should be obvious that White can only move his queen and QR. The queen moves would prepare ♘f1! while 16 ♖c1 would set up ♖c3. White opted for 16 ♕c1! - rather than 16 ♕c2 ♗f5 17 ♕c3 ♖d3. Then came 16 ... ♖he8 17 ♘f1! ♕e6 18 ♕c3. He had survived the initial crisis and met 18 ... ♗g4 with 19 ♘g3. Then 19 ... ♗xe2 20 ♖xe2 ♕g4 would win the f4-pawn. But with a knight to defend the kingside White can escape to safety with 21 ♖xe8 ♖xe8+ 22 ♔f2 ♕xf4+ 23 ♔g2 (23 ... ♖e3 24 ♖f1!). The last major challenge was posed by 19 ... h5! (instead of 19 ... ♗xe2). Once again White's choices are so limited that it helped him decide. He can quickly reject 20 ♕e5 ♕c6, for example. More attractive is 20 h4 but he might be losing that pawn after ... ♗xe2 and ... ♕g4. The choice is mainly between seeking king safety (20 ♔f1) and trading pieces (20 ♖d1 and ♖xd8+). Both policies have merits, since 20 ♔f1 h4 21 ♘e4! defends (21 ... ♕xe4 22 ♗xg4+). But White opted for 20 ♖d1 h4 21 ♖xd8+. After 21 ... ♖xd8 he could defend with 22 ♘f1 ♖e8 since 23 ♕e5! works this time. Black's choice was once again difficult and he preferred 21 ... ♔xd8. He apparently overlooked or underestimated 22 f5! which led to 22 ... gxf5 23 ♕d3+ ♔c8 24 ♘xf5. The knight was ready to kill the attack with ♘e7+ or ♘d4. Black tried 24 ... ♕xf6 but he resigned soon after 25 ♘e3! ♗xe2 26 ♖xe2 ♕g7 27 ♘d5. Give-Back Time Even Tal could be thrown off when an opponent gave sacrificed material back to him. Can you figure out how to do it effectively? Tal - Huebner, Leningrad 1973

16 f6 ♗xf6 17 ♖xf6 gxf6
Black knew that an Exchange sacrifice on f6 was possible when he castled. But he appreciated that 15 ... ♘e5, for example, would be more dangerous. Then 16 fxe6 fxe6 17 ♕g3! ♗f6 18 ♗h5+ ♘f7 and now 19 ♖xf6! gxf6 20 ♕g7 would promise a winning attack. In the diagram it looks like White has all the weapons. But Black has an extra pawn and Exchange. He can give up some of his material surplus. For example, 18 ♖d3 ♘e5 19 ♗h6 prepares ♕h4. This looks dangerous in view of 19 ... ♔h8 20 ♕h4 ♕e7 21 ♖h3 followed by ♗xf8 or ♗g7+ (or 21 ... ♖g8 22 ♗f8!). But the knight reinforcement would arrive in time, 19 ... ♘g6! (20 ♖g3 ♕c5+ 21 ♔h1 ♔h8 with advantage). So instead of the immediate 18 ♖d3 Tal played 18 ♕h4 ♕e7 19 ♖d3. He set a delicious trap. This time the safety-minded 19 ... ♔h8?? loses to 20 ♗d4! ♘xd4 21 ♖h3!. Black found the superior 19 ... f5!. Of course, White declined to trade queens. But his 20 ♗g5 f6 21 ♗h6 was simply met by 21 ... fxe4!. White was so far behind in material that he had no alternative to 22 ♖g3+ ♔h8 23 ♗g7+ ♕xg7 24 ♖xg7 ♔xg7. Then material was roughly equal. But Black had the better chances, e.g. 25 ♕g4+ ♔h8 26 ♕xe6 ♘e5 and ... f5-f4 or 25 ♘xe4 ♘e5 26 ♘g3 ♔g8. He eventually won. One final defensive technique works best when facing a strong opponent: Look for the resource that even a good calculator might have overlooked when he first considered the sacrifice.

What could have convinced him that the knight sacrifice was sound? One answer is the threats he would get from 17 ♗xh6+! ♔xh6 18 ♘xf7+ ♔g7 19 ♖e5! (19 ... ♘xe5 20 ♘xe5 and ♕g6+ or 19 ... ♕c7 20 ♖g5+). He might also have thought in general terms: The knight on e5 keeps Black's queen from joining the kingside defense. After 16 ... ♘xe5 he can choose between 17 ♗xe5, with the idea of ♖e3-g3+ or -f3, and 17 ♖xe5. This is far from convincing, as 16 ... ♘xe5 17 ♗xe5 ♖g8 and ... ♔f8 indicates. But Black preferred 16 ... ♖h8, which has the advantage of protecting h6 and clearing an escape route for the king. Tal had an ingenious response, 17 ♕h3, with the idea of 18 ♘xf7! ♔xf7 19 ♕xe6+ and ♕xe7+ (or 19 ... ♔g6 20 ♖e3 and ♖g3+). White may have seen this far when he sacrificed the knight. In that case he would have examined 17 ... ♘xe5 and then 18 ♗xe5 followed by ♖e3-f3. But there's an alternative to 17 ... ♘xe5 and it's one that would have been very hard to visualize, let along calculate with certainty, when White was looking at 15 ♘xg7. Take a few minutes to look at this position and see if you can figure out what that might be. The answer Black came up with was 17 ... ♖h7!. Not only does it meet the threat - 18 ♘xf7? ♔xf7 19 ♕xe6+ ♔e8 (20 ♗d6 ♕d5) - but it does so in a way that White probably didn't foresee when the rook was at f8 and the king at g8 in the first diagram. White's attack began to run out of steam after 18 c4 ♘f8! 19 ♖ad1 ♖d8 20 ♗d2 ♕b6 21 ♗c3 ♔g8 and he was on the way to a loss after 22 ♖e3 ♘e8 23 ♖g3+ ♘g7 24 ♖dd3 f6 25 ♘g6 ♘xg6 26 ♖xg6 ♔f7. And now for some quiz positions drawn from Tal's games. Quiz The first defensive move that would occur to many players is 1 ... g6. Then White could try to win a good-N-vs-bad-B ending after 2 ♖c1. Is there better for Black? White, a pawn down, threatens ♖xh5. There are four ways to parry that. How many are good? White plans ♗xf6 and ♕g5 mate and also has ♖f1/♘f5 coming up. Is 1 ... fxg5 2 ♕xg5+ with a perpetual check the best Black has? White prepared ♖xh6+. For example on 1 ... ♗e2, he would obtain the edge with 2 ♖xh6+! gxh6 3 ♖f6 ♕c7+ 4 ♘c6!! (not 4 ♔d2 ♕a5+ 5 ♔xe2 ♕g5!). What else can Black do? Black is in check. What is the safe way out? Chapter Ten: Last Chance to Defend When you have a worse position and you're getting closer to an endgame, your defensive resources begin to dwindle. This means you should evaluate your losing chances carefully. Once you know how near you are to a hopeless position you may appreciate what it takes to draw. Black is a pawn down and may lose another. Just a trade of queens would likely doom him. He realized he needs to take extreme measures. Even with just seconds left to reach the time control seven moves away, he saw tactical chances: White's queen is temporarily tied to the defense of g2, he lacks luft and Black has a passed pawn. With 1 ... c2! Black forced White to worry about 2 ... ♕b2/3 ... c1(♕). After White replied 2 ♖c1, Black came back with 2 ... ♖c8! and renewed the threat of 3 ... ♕b2! (3 ♖xc2?? ♕a1+). White's response, 3 ♕xe6, attacked the rook. But Black had 3 ... ♖d8! with a threat of 4 ... ♖d1+. White's lack of luft cost him (4 ♖xc2?? ♖d1 mate.) He played 4 ♕b3 but Black found 4 ... ♖d2!. Black was a move away (... ♕d4, ... ♕f6) from serious winning threats. White had no way of untangling himself so he forced a draw with checks at b8 and b2. Black's position became easier to play - even in bad time pressure - once he realized how desperate he had to be. A less clear situation arises when your position is not obviously worse but vulnerable to a bad trend: Some computers evaluate this position as more or less equal. They don't appreciate how useless the bishop would be when Black begins to push his f-pawn. Only when forced to examine 1 ... f5! followed by ... ♕e7/ ... f4 will those programs recognize that Black can make progress. White correctly understood how bad things could get and took the desperate- looking step of 1 ♖xe5! dxe5 2 d6. The White pawn cannot be prevented from reaching d7. On that protected square it will tie at least one Black piece to d8 and free the White queen to raid pawns. Now it was Black who was forced to evaluate his chances. He recognized his winning prospects had evaporated and went for the perpetual check of 2 ... ♕d8 3 ♕d5 ♕g5! and 4 ♕xc5 ♕c1+ 5 ♔h2 ♕f4+ 6 ♔g1 ♕c1+. What it Takes to Lose When queens are traded off the defender can almost always make a more accurate appraisal of his chances than before. That will tell him whether he can rely on passive defense or must seek counterplay, whether he should trade pawns or can await events, and so on. Appraising the position is easier if you know what it takes to lose - or to win. White is lost because his rook is not far enough away to check the Black king when it tries to shepherd the winning f-pawn. For example, 1 ... ♔e3! threatens 2 ... ♖-moves and 3 ... f1(♕). Then 2 ♖e5+ can be met by 2 ... ♔f4!. This attack on the rook gains time for Black and he can win in various ways, such as 3 ♖e8 ♖e1 4 ♖f8+ ♔g3. Yet in the game Black only drew because he didn't know what it takes to win. He played 1 ... ♔xc4??. White recovered with 2 ♖f8!. The rook is then in splendid position to check the king away if it tried to promote the f-pawn (2 ... ♔d4 3 ♖d8+ ♔e5 4 ♖e8+ ♔d6 5 ♖f8 etc.). Black's only winning try lies in advancing the a-pawn. But after ♔a2 White can just pass with his rook or check. For example, 2 ... a5 3 ♖f7 a4 4 ♖f8! a3+ 5 ♔a2 (not 5 ♔xa3?? ♖a1+ or 5 ♔c2?? a2) ♔d3 6 ♖d8+ ♔e3 7 ♖e8+ ♔d2 8 ♖d8+ ♔c2 9 ♖f8 is one of many drawing lines. The defender is typically torn between impulses. The first is to play actively: "I want to force a draw. I don't want to give him a chance to find a way to win." The second is passive: "Come and get me. My position is solid. I'm not going to do something rash that might lose." Both are valid attitudes. In most cases, one is better than the other. In some cases, much better. This kind of position rarely occurs in master games - because masters would have agreed to a draw earlier. The reason is that if Black allows a trade of pawns, the result is likely to reach the famously drawn 'Philidor position.' And if he doesn't trade pawns he has no way to make progress. White doesn't have to do anything but 'pass' with his rook along the fourth rank to stop ... ♔g4. For example, 1 ♖b4 ♖a6 2 ♖c4 ♖a3+ 3 ♔g2 ♔h5 and now 4 ♖h4+ ♔g5 5 ♖b4 ♔f6 6 ♖b6+ ♔g5 7 ♖b4. Or 2 ... ♔f6 3 ♖b4 g5 4 ♖c4 g4+ 5 ♔f4 or even 5 ♔g2 ♔g5 6 ♖b4. Notice that in this last line White can also play actively and try to force a Philidor-like position with 3 g4. Play might go 3 ... ♖a3+ 4 ♔g2 ♔g5 5 gxf5 gxf5 and now 6 ♖b4 (pass) f4 7 ♖b8 ♔g4 8 ♖g8+ draws. But the last diagram could be a study: How can White lose in one (reasonable) move? He did it with 1 g4??. White wanted to force a draw, not wait for it. But active defense was a disastrous choice here. Black replied 1 ... ♖e4!. Now White faces a dismal choice between giving up a second pawn (2 ♖a8 ♖xg4) or the equally lost pawn ending, 2 ♖xe4 fxe4+ 3 ♔xe4 ♔xg4 or 3 ♔g3 e3 4 ♔f3 e2. Even in a battle between two of the world's top-20 players, a defender can make a losing choice between active and passive. If the pawn on f5 didn't exist White would have known that 1 ♖h3! is the road to Philidor. The c-pawn is irrelevant: 1 ... ♖xc5 2 ♔f1 (or 2 ♖a3, 2 ♖b3 etc.). If Black pushes his advanced pawn, 1 ... f3, the draw is obvious after 2 ♖h8! (2 ... ♔e3 3 ♖e8+ ♔f4 4 ♖g8 or 4 ♖e7 or 4 ♔f1). But White was hypnotized by that extra pawn and felt he had to play 1 ♖c8?. He was not lost - yet. But after 1 ... f3: White can still draw by putting his rook in a position to give check, with, 2 ♖a8, 2 ♖b8, 2 ♖d8, or to check immediately, 2 ♖e8+. But he blundered with 2 c6?? and resigned after 2 ... f2+ in view of 3 ♔f1 ♔f3 and ... ♖c1 mate. (In fact, 2 ♔f1 would also draw because then 2 ... f2 would alert White to play 2 ♖a8, 2 ♖b8 etc. The opposite side of the coin is shown by this. Passive play is fatal: Since Black only has one pawn, its elimination would, at worst, leave White to defend K+R-vs.-K+R+B. That is a difficult endgame but it is drawable with best play. Therefore White should get rid of the Black pawn by means of f2-f3 and g3- g4!. But White played 1 f4?, depriving himself of the pawn-trading option. Worse, it fixed his f- and -g-pawns on squares where they will ultimately be lost. White held out for a long time but the course of the game, after 1 ... ♖g8 2 ♖b7 ♔d6 3 ♔f2 ♗d7 4 ♖b6+ ♔e7 5 ♖g6 ♔f7 6 ♖d6 ♗e6 7 ♖a6 ♖xg7, was determined. New Defense in the Endgame If New Defense has given us any insight into the endgame it is an emphasis on - guess what? - counterplay. Here's how we look today at one of the great endings of the past. This endgame has found its way into dozens of textbooks. It was used as a model of how to make slow progress: 1 ♖c3 ♖a4 2 ♖d3 ♔e7 3 ♔g3 ♔e6 4 ♔f3 ♔d5 5 ♔e2 g5! (Not 5 ... ♖xd4? 6 ♔e3! when White's outside passed pawn allows him to draw the pawn ending). Black won after 6 ♖b3 f6 7 ♔e3 ♔c4 8 ♖d3 d5! 9 ♔e2 ♖a7 10 ♔d2 ♖e7! 11 ♖c3+ ♔xd4. Although White wrote a book about rook endgames his play is much worse than analysts have given him credit. As Russian GM Alexey Bezgodov put it, he played at about the level of an Expert. The real lesson of this game should be: Rook endings reward active play and punish passivity. Grab your hand whenever it tries to make a passive rook move. One way to start is 1 ♖a2, getting behind the passed pawn and threatening to tie up Black's rook after 2 a4, 3 a5, etc. Black should blockade, 1 ... ♖a4!. But after 2 ♔g3 White's king races to break the blockade, e.g. 2 ... ♔e7 3 ♔f3 ♔e6 4 ♔e4 and then 4 ... f5+ 5 ♔d3 ♔d5 6 ♔c3, for example. When Black captures on d4 he releases the a-pawn, e.g. 2 ... ♖xd4 3 a4!. Yes, Black can re-establish the blockade with 3 ... ♖b4 4 a5 ♖b7 5 a6 ♖a7. But then his pieces are too passive to make progress after 6 ♔f4 ♔e7 7 ♔e4 ♔e6 8 ♖a5!. White could also have drawn with another active use of the rook, 1 ♖c6! ♔e7 2 ♖c7+ ♔f6 3 ♖c6! ♔e6 4 ♖c7! and then 4 ... ♖xa3 5 d5+! (5 ... ♔xd5 6 ♖xf7) ♔f6 6 ♖d7! ♖a6 7 h4. Black has no way to make progress. Passing fails (7 ... ♖b6 8 ♔g3). And there's another way to draw with an active rook. After the game went 1 ♖c3? ♖a4 White could have played 2 ♔g3! ♖xd4 3 ♖c8+ ♔e7 4 ♖a8! and again he has made his rook active. Black will eventually have to trade his d-pawn for the White a-pawn, e.g. 4 ... ♖d3+ 5 f3 g5 6 a4 ♖a3 7 a5 d5 8 a5! d5 9 a6 d4 10 ♖a7+ ♔e6 11 ♖a8 d3 12 ♖d8!. There are still other ways to draw, after the game went 2 ♖d3? ♔e7. Even here active play is rewarded: 3 ♖e3+! ♔d7 4 ♖f3! f6 5 ♖g3! g5 6 h4!. Just keep the rook active! The Insufficient Extra Pawn A good defender knows a basic difference: If he is down two pawns, his position is almost certainly lost. But if he is down only one pawn, the outcome depends on other factors. Those factors are the identity of what other pieces are on the board, how many pawns are left and where they are. That sounds like a lot of information but it gets easier to sort out as you gain experience. For example, one extra pawn is usually not enough to win if it's a rook ending and all the pawns are on the kingside. In the next example, White has much better chances if he can trade rooks rather than knights. He should proceed slowly, such as with 1 g3 and 2 ♖c7 or 2 ♖c6. He should avoid the immediate 1 ♖c6 because 1 ... ♘e5! would force knights off the board. A key point is 2 ♖xf6 ♘xf3+ 3 ♖xf3?? allows 3 ... ♖e1 mate. That means 3 gxf3 would be forced. The pawn structure that results is highly drawish. Endgame books show many examples of R+f-pawn+h-pawn-versus-R that are drawn. In the game, White made it easier, with 1 g4?. Then 1 ... ♘e5! either wins the g- pawn or trades knights. White played 2 ♘xe5 ♖xe5. Black was able to swap a pair of pawns, 3 ♔g2 h5!, and a draw was agreed soon after 4 f4 ♖e2+ 5 ♔f3 ♖xh2 6 ♔g3 ♖a2 7 gxh5 ♖a5 8 ♔g4 ♔g7. White's king cannot advance and his lone rook cannot promote the passed h- pawn. After benefiting from active moves (1 ... ♘e5! and 3 ... h5!) Black can now rely on passive defense: He can just pass. In fact, Black could also draw with other passes such as 8 ... ♖b5. The more generic drawable endings you know, the greater your ability to steer out of a dubious middlegame. For example, even with more pawns on the kingside in a rook ending, the defender has excellent drawing chances when he's only one pawn down. Black's pinned pawn at c5 appears to be doomed by ♘d2-b3xc5. Black can't change the situation by 1 ... cxb4?? 2 ♖xc7 or 1 ... ♘b6 2 ♖xc5. However, he saved himself with a forcing sequence, beginning with 1 ... e4!. The worst would be behind him after 2 ♖xe4 cxb4!. The same goes for 2 ♘d4 ♘e5! because of 3 ♖xc5 ♖xc5 4 bxc5 ♘d3! and 5 ... ♖xc5. The crucial line goes 2 ♕xe4 ♕xe4 3 ♖xe4 cxb4. White can improve his winning chances with 4 ♖e8+! ♖xe8 5 ♖xc7. Material is still equal but White's powerfully placed rook must win at least a pawn. If Black tries to swap off all the queenside pawns, say with 5 ... ♘f6 6 ♖xa7 ♖c8 White retains chances with 7 ♔f1. Even worse is trading rooks, with 5 ... ♘b6 6 ♖xa7 ♖a8? because 7 ♖xa8+ ♘xa8 9 ♘d4 offers strong winning chances. Knight endgames are often much more winnable than rook endings with the same pawns. Black's saving grace was 5 ... ♘e5! and 6 ♘xe5 ♖xe5 7 ♖xa7 h5 6 h3 ♖b5. White cannot avoid ... b3/axb3/ ... ♖xb3. What will be left is K+R+4Ps-vs.- K+R+3Ps. But since all the pawns will be on the kingside and Black has no real weakness there, a draw is the most likely result. White tried to win with 7 g4 hxg4 8 hxg4 g6 9 ♔g2 b3 10 axb3 ♖xb3 11 g5 ♔g7 12 ♔g3. But he couldn't penetrate Black's position and a draw was eventually agreed, after 12 ... ♖c3 13 ♖e7 ♖a3 14 ♖d7 ♔f8 15 ♖c7 ♔g7 16 ♖c8 ♔h7 17 ♖c7 ♔g7 etc. Trick Positions There are a few unusual drawable positions that violate many endgame principles. A good defender knows them. Many of these involve rook pawns. Any good endgame textbook will show you the cases when K+Q-vs.-K+P is drawn if the defender has a rook pawn (or a bishop pawn) that is on the seventh and protected by a king. You can also find the notorious case of K+B+RP-vs.-K which is a draw when the defender's king can reach the queening square and that square cannot be attacked by the bishop. In addition, K+R+P-vs.-K+R may be drawn when it's a rook pawn - but quite lost in similar positions with any other pawn. This is confusing to many amateurs because it is generally bad for the defender to be facing a RP in cases of K+N+P- vs.-K+N or K+B+P-vs.-K+same colored B. In the simplest endgame of all, with just kings and a pawn (or two), the rook pawn often saves the defender. This looks resignable because White will win the a-pawn. For example, 1 ... ♔d4 can be met by 2 ♔d6 ♔c3 3 ♔c5 ♔b2 and now 4 a4! ♔xb3 5 ♔b5 ♔c3 6 ♔xa5. Black's king cannot get back in time to stop promotion, It gets shouldered out by the enemy king (6 ... ♔c4 7 ♔b6 ♔d5 8 a5 ♔d6 9 a6). A better try is 1 ... ♔d5 but White reaches the same positions after 2 a4. Yet Black drew with 1 ... a4!. The main point is 2 bxa4 ♔d5 3 ♔d7 ♔c5 and ... ♔b4xa4 also dooms the a2-pawn. A secondary point is that after White found 2 b4! ... ... Black replied 2 ... a3!. He will either win the b-pawn (3 b5 ♔d5) or the a-pawn (3 ♔d7 ♔d4 4 b5 ♔c3 5 b6 ♔b2 6 b7 ♔xa2). Special Cases: Bishops of Opposite Color There are also a few other special situations a defender should know. Even if there are pawns on both wings, you can often draw one pawn or even two pawns down when there are bishops of opposite color. Leonhardt - Teichmann, Karlsbad 1907
1 e4 e5 2 ♘f3 ♘c6 3 ♘c3 ♘f6 4 ♗b5 ♗b4 5 O-O O-O 6 d3 d6 7 ♗g5 ♘e7 8 ♗xf6
gxf6 9 ♘h4 c6 10 ♗c4 b5 11 ♗b3 ♗c5? 12 ♕h5 ♔g7 13 ♘e2 ♘g6 Black dodged disaster because 14 ♘g3 can be met by 14 ... ♘xh4 15 ♕xh4 f5! 16 ♘h5+ ♔h6! and his king is remarkably safe. Play went 14 ♘f5+ ♗xf5 15 exf5 ♘f4! 16 ♘xf4 exf4 17 ♕g4+ ♔h8 18 ♕xf4. Despite White's extra pawn and Black's doubled pawns, a draw is the most likely result simply because of the bishops. Black made a swap of all four rooks virtually inevitable after he took control of the e-file, 18 ... d5 19 d4 ♗d6 20 ♕h4 ♖e8!. Then came 21 ♖ae1 ♖xe1 22 ♖xe1 ♔g7 23 ♕g4+ ♔h8 24 ♕h4 ♔g7 25 c3 ♕d7 26 ♗c2 ♖e8 27 ♖e3 ♖xe3 28 fxe3. White retains remote winning chances if he can play an effective e3-e4. But Black snuffed them out with 28 ... b4 so that if 29 e4 bxc3 30 bxc3 dxe4 and ... c5. The game saw 29 cxb4 ♕b7!, which is better than 29 ... ♗xb4 30 ♕g3+ ♔h6 because it offers counterplay against White's queenside pawns. After 30 a3 a5! White didn't like the looks of 31 bxa5 ♕xb2, so a draw was agreed after 31 ♕g4+ ♔f8 32 ♕h4 ♔g7 33 ♕g4+ ♔f8 34 ♕h4 ♔g7. Fortress Good defenders try to trade pawns when they are behind in material because it reduces the chances of the opponent queening or of winning another pawn. But eliminating enemy pawns is crucial to another drawing technique - the creation of an impregnable fortress. In this position from a candidates match, White seems to have excellent chances of making his extra pawn count because it's a passed queenside pawn. After a routine move of the attacked rook, 1 ... ♖c8, White can secure his king, 2 g3, and prepare to increase pressure with ♕d5/♖b7. Black has no tactical tricks since 1 ... ♕e8, hoping for 2 ♘xc4? ♕xb5 with a draw, is foiled by 2 ♘d7! and 2 ... ♖c7 3 ♖d5. There is one other trap in the position and Black eagerly fell into it, 1 ... ♖xb4! 2 ♘c6, and then 2 ... ♖xb5 3 ♘xe7+ ♗xe7. White's material edge had grown but his winning chances are greatly diminished. He began the final stage with 4 ♕d7 ♖b1+ 5 ♔h2 ♗f8. To win White will need a passed pawn or the penetration of his king - and possibly both. His difficulties are illustrated by 6 g4 ♖b2 7 ♔g3 g5! with a likely draw. The game went 6 f4 h5 7 f5 ♖b6! 8 e4 g6! and the outlines of a fortress were becoming apparent. After 9 fxg6 ♖xg6 Black could shuttle his rook between g6 and e6 forever and draw. White made a valiant effort, 9 ♕d8 ♖d6 10 ♕g5 ♗g7 11 ♕e7 ♗f8 12 ♕g5 ♗g7 13 ♕f4 ♖a6 14 ♕b8+ ♗f8 15 ♕b5 ♖f6 and then 16 ♔h3 gxf5 17 exf5 ♖h6 18 g3. White's king can get as far as g5 but no further because of the Black rook. Play went 18 ... ♖h7 19 ♕e2 ♖h6 20 ♔h4 ♖h7 21 ♕e8 ♖h6 22 ♔g5 ♖h7 23 ♕c8 ♔g7 24 ♕d8 ♔g8. White made one last try, advancing his f-pawn: 25 ♔f4 ♖h6 26 ♔e5 ♔g7 27 ♕g5+ ♔h7 28 f6 and then 28 ... ♔h8 29 ♔e4 ♔h7 30 ♔d5 ♔h8. If the king heads for e8 with 31 ♔c6 Black has 31 ... ♖g6! 32 ♕xh5+ ♔g8 and he wins the f6-pawn (33 ♕e5 ♗g7!) or draws by repetition. White saw the light and agreed to a draw after 31 ♕e5 ♔g8 32 ♔e4 ♖g6 33 ♔f5 ♖g4 34 ♕e3. Simple techniques like trading pawns and obtaining bishops of opposite color and more elaborate ones such as fortress are powerful aids to the defender. But the most important element in drawing an ending is knowing what it takes to lose and when active defense is a must. And now for our final set of quiz positions. Quiz Black has all the winning chances. Evaluate 1 ♘d2. Black can draw easily. How? White's pawn is the more dangerous one. What can Black do? White appears to be a move or two (g2-g3, ♖d1-d7) away from gaining a second extra pawn and a textbook win. How does Black stop him? White's rook is tied to the a-file to prevent queening. But she envisions an iron- clad drawing position. Which? Solutions
1. Black can attack h2 by means of ... ♖h5 (after ... ♗g4, for example). If White
defends with h2-h3, Black would win with ... ♗xh3. This explains 1 ♕g1!, an extreme example of the principle of economy. Yes, White is using his best piece to defend just one square. But this is less of a concession than h2-h3. White's advantage emerged after 1 ... ♗g4 2 ♖a5 ♗e2 3 ♘b3 ♗b4 4 ♖a4 ♖b8 5 ♘e5 ♖bb5 6 ♘xc6, White would also have had the edge after 1 ... ♗xc5 2 dxc5 ♖xc5 3 ♘d6.
2. Giving up castling, 1 ... ♖g8 or 1 ... ♔f8, is too great a concession. But 1 ... g6 2
♗b5! is a problem (2 ... ♖d8 3 O-O and ♗c6 at some point). Best is 1 ... O-O even though it costs the Exchange, 2 ♗h6 g6 3 ♗xf8 ♗xf8. By changing the nature Black has strong counterchances such as 4 ♗b5 ♗h6 or, as the game went, 4 ♗e2? ♗h6 5 ♖c2 ♘f4 6 O-O ♗xg2, with advantage.
3. Black looked at 1 ... g6 2 ♘f6+ and considered it lost (2 ... ♗xf6 3 ♕xf6 cxb2 4
♗h6 ♕xf1+ 5 ♕xf1 and ♕b1xb2; 2 ... ♔h8 3 ♖h4 h5 4 ♖xh5+; 2 ... ♔g7 3 ♗h6+). "Desperation is in order," he wrote about the move he played, 1 ... f5!?. After 2 ♖xg7+ ♔h8 he would still lose after 3 ♕g3!, threatening ♖xh7+ and ♕g7 mate. For instance, 3 ... ♗f6 4 ♖xf5 cxb2 5 ♖xh7+! ♔xh7 6 ♘xf6+ ♖xf6 7 ♖h5+. But White found what looks like a simpler win, 3 ♕h3. The threat is 4 ♖xh7+! ♔xh7 5 ♘f6+ ♔g7 6 ♕h7+ ♔xf6 7 ♖xf5 mate. But Black had time for 3 ... ♕xf1+! 4 ♔xf1 cxb2. Without a rook at f1, the threat of queening prompted White to force a perpetual check, 5 ♖xh7+ ♔xh7 6 ♘f4+ ♔g8 7 ♕g3+ ♔h7 8 ♕g6+ ♔h8 9 ♕h6+.
4. The least expensive defense against the threat is 1 ... ♖e8!. Then on 2 d6 he
replied 2 ... ♘d5. Black has an edge after 3 ♕d3 ♕b6 (4 ♘bd2 h6 5 ♗h4 ♘f4! 6 ♕f1 ♖ac8) or, as the game went, 3 ♗xd8 ♖xe2. Better for White was 2 ♖e1 since that forces the move Black has been trying to avoid, 2 ... f6. Black would be better after 3 d6 ♘d5.
5. Black wins after 1 ♗xg5? fxg5 2 ♘xg5+ ♔f6! - a move that defends and
attacks. For example, 3 ♕f3+ ♔xg5!. White played 3 ♖xe6+, hoping for 3 ... ♖xe6 4 ♕f3+. But he resigned after 3 ... ♔xg5! 4 ♕f3 ♖c1+ 5 ♔g2 ♘h4+ 6 ♔g3 ♖g1+.
6. Black is as entitled to tactics as White. He won a pawn with 1 ... ♗xg4!, based
on 2 ♗xf6 ♗xf3 and 2 ♗xg4 ♘xg4 3 ♕xg4 ♗xd4+ (or 3 ♗xg7 ♕h5!, threatening mate on h2).
7. The position was roughly balanced before 1 f4?. That's an unjustified
attacking move that Black began to punish with 1 ... ♗d5!. White's pawns would be over-extended after 2 e4 ♖e8 3 ♖e3 ♗b7. So he maneuvered his heavy pieces, 2 ♖d2 ♗e4! 3 ♕f2, while Black made progress with 3 ... ♖d7 4 ♕g3 ♖e8 5 ♕f2 ♗d3!. The e-pawn is falling (6 ♖c1 ♖de7 7 ♖e1? ♕xd4! 8 exd4 ♖xe1+) and Black won after 6 ♖c1 ♖de7 7 ♘f3 ♖xe3.
8. Black violated the rule against making new weaknesses with 1 ... f5!. White
would get nowhere from 2 ♕g3+ ♔h7 3 ♖fd1 ♘c5. He penetrated the eighth rank, 2 ♖fd1 ♘c5 3 ♖d8. But the improved communication of Black pieces stopped him, 3 ... ♕f7 4 ♖xe8 ♕xe8, and Black took over the initiative after 5 ♗d4 ♘e4 6 f3 e5! 7 fxe4 exd4.
9. Yes, 1 ... f6! is much better. It is based tactically on 2 ♘xf6+ ♗xf6 3 ♕xf6 ♖f8 4
♕-moves ♖xf3! since 5 gxf3 ♕xf3 leads to mate. It is based positionally on the superior pawn structure that Black will have after ... e5. He won after 2 ♗h6 O-O 3 ♗xg7 ♔xg7 4 ♖fe1 e5 5 b4 ♖ad8 and ... ♘e6-f4.
10. Black can't safely castle kingside. Delaying a decision about his king (1 ... e6
2 O-O ♗d6 3 ♖ae1) doesn't help.
It's time for an ugly move, 1 ... ♔d8!, to get the king to safety at b8. One possible line would run 2 O-O ♔c7 3 ♔h1 ♔b8 and Black stands well.
11. Endgames should favor Black's superior pawns. He won after 1 ... h5! 2 ♖af1
♕g4!.
12. The first two options allow the dangerous h-file to be opened. Black may be
able to escape with his material - computers tend to like 1 ... gxh5 2 ♖xh5 ♗f6 and 3 ♖g1 ♕d7. But for humans, the safest policy is 1 ... g5! since after 2 ♗xg5 Black is still a pawn ahead and the pawn at h5 is usefully 'dead.' The game went 2 ... ♕d6 3 ♖h4. Then 3 ... g3 4 ♖g4 ♔h8 is wrong because 5 ♗xe7! wins. Black gave back a second extra pawn with 3 ... ♘f6! 4 ♗xf6 ♕xf6 5 ♖xg4+ ♔h8 and had a strong attack (6 ♖g6? ♗f4! wins).
13. Black is safe after 1 ♗xh6 gxh6 2 ♖xh6 ♗f6. But in the longer run, g7 and
h6 can become targets after ♘g3-f5. Black made a wise decision to eliminate White's good bishop with 1 ... ♗g5!. Black stood well after 2 ♗xg5 ♕xg5 3 ♖h5 ♕g6 with ideas such as ... ♘f6-h7-g5. The weakest target on the board then is at f3. He got the edge following 4 ♘g3 ♘f6 5 ♘f5 ♗xf5 6 exf5? ♕e8 with the idea of ... e4. White's 7 ♖xh6? sacrifice was unsound and lost after 7 ... gxh6 8 ♖xh6 e4 9 ♕e3 ♕e5+ 10 ♔c1 ♖a1.
14. He can reinforce his king position with 1 ... ♖f8! followed by ... ♘e8 and ...
f6. This works because 2 ♘h5 ♘e8 3 ♗xg7 fails to 3 ... ♕g5!, threatening mate on g2 as well as ... ♘xg7. Black was better when a draw was agreed, after 3 ♖e3 f6 4 ♗d4.
15. No, Black seized the edge with 1 ... e5! 2 dxe5 ♗f5. He had good winning
chances after 3 ♖e2 ♗g4! 4 ♖ae1 ♗xf3 5 gxf3 ♖xe5.
16. He should flee. After 1 ... ♔f7! 2 g4 ♔e8! 3 ♖h2 ♔d7 Black was secure.
White's king could have been the more vulnerable one after 4 ♘g3 ♕f7 5 gxf5 gxf5 6 ♖h5 ♖g8. In the game White preferred 5 ♔g2 fxg4 6 ♗e3 and Black seized the initiative after 6 ... ♖h8.
17. With 1 ... ♗c8! Black reinforces the kingside with a piece that wasn't doing
much on b7. He looks at 2 ... ♗xf5 and is able to meet 2 ♗xe4 dxe4 3 ♖h3 h6 4 ♘xh6+ gxh6 5 ♕xh6 with 5 ... ♗xh3!. (In the game White played 5 ♖g3+ ♔h7 6 ♖xf7+ ♖xf7 7 ♕xf7+ ♔h8 and lost.) On the other hand, 1 ... g6 2 ♕h6! gxf5 3 ♗xe4 dxe4 would have walked into 4 ♖h3 ♕g7 5 ♖g3.
18. Once White's strong bishop is traded off and his d-pawn is block aded, his
weakened king position and the pawn at b2 will matter most. The game went 1 ... ♕b6 2 ♖d2 ♗f8! 3 ♖2e2 ♗d6! 4 ♕c1 g5! 5 ♗xd6 ♕xd6. White's d-pawn had gone from a strength to a weakness. His best chance for survival lay on the kingside but Black had the better chances there and won after 6 ♖f1 ♖f8 7 ♖2f2 ♗e8! 8 ♘f3 ♖g7 9 ♕d2 h5!.
19. White would have a strong attack after 1 ... fxg6 2 hxg6 hxg6 3 ♖dg1 or 2 ... h6
3 ♗xh6! gxh6 4 ♕xh6 (4 ... ♗f6 5 g7! ♗xg7 6 ♖dg1 and wins). With 1 ... ♗f6! and 2 ♖dg1 ♗a8 Black safeguarded g7 and began opera tions on the b-file. After 3 ♗g5 ♗e5 4 gxh7+ he avoided the dead pawn (4 ... ♔h8? 5 h6 g6 6 f4!) with 4 ... ♔xh7. Black can keep lines closed after 5 h6 g6 6 f4 ♗h8 (7 f5 ♘xe4). White tried to block the b-file with 5 ♘b3? and overlooked 5 ... ♘xc2! (6 ♕xc2 ♖xb3: 6 ♘xc5 ♘a3+! 7 ♔a2 ♕xc5 8 ♘a4 ♘c2! 9 ♔b1 ♕a3 and wins).
20. Black should realize that White has an attack brewing with g2-g4-g5.
Moreover, he should see that 1 ... dxc4? 2 ♘xc4 favors White's space and development edge. And he should understand that counterplay with 1 ... b5! is good. His attack would come first after 2 cxb5?! axb5 3 ♗xb5 ♗d7 or 3 ♘xb5 e5 4 ♗g3 ♗a6 and 4 ♕xc6 ♗d7 5 ♕c2 ♗xb5. In the game White was worse after 2 cxd5 exd5 3 g4 ♗e6.
21. In the center, with 1 ... f6! since 2 fxe6? fxe5 would give Black fine play. The
game went 2 exf6 ♗xf6 3 fxe6 d4! and Black had ample compensation. A draw resulted after 4 e7 ♕xe7 5 ♗xd4 ♗xd4 6 ♕xd4 ♕g5.
22. With the counterattack 1 ... ♕e7! 2 gxh6 ♕h4! Black has at least perpetual
check, e.g. 3 hxg7 ♗h3+ 4 ♔g1 ♕g3+ or 3 ♗xd5 ♗h3+ 4 ♔g1 ♕g3+ 5 ♗g2 ♗xg2 6 ♕xg2 ♕e1+.
23. With 1 ... ♖xd3! 2 ♖xd3 ♗e4 Black sharply reduced White's attacking
chances (3 ♖g3 ♕xc4 4 ♗xg7? ♗f5! 5 ♕h5 ♗xg7 6 ♕xh6 ♗g6). His loss of the Exchange was offset by winning a pawn, 3 ♖d2 ♕xc4. White set some traps and offered a second pawn, 4 ♖fd1 ♗d5 (else ♖d8!) 5 h3 f5 (not 5 ... ♕xa2 6 ♖xd5!) 6 ♕g6 ♕xf4. The end-result was a hard-fought draw after 7 ♖xd5! ♕e3+ 8 ♔h1 exd5 9 ♕xf5 ♖d8 10 ♖xd5 ♕c1+ 11 ♔h2 ♗d6+ 12 ♗e5 ♗c7!.
24. The less risky alternative to 1 h4 ♘xh4 2 gxh4 g3+ 3 ♔g1 ♕xh4 is 1 ♖xf5!
♗xf5 2 h4!. The attack is over and White pressure on the f-file and her great knight offers solid compensation. After 2 ... ♔b8 3 ♕e3 ♗c8 4 ♖f1 she can continue with ♖f4 and ♕f2 to tie Black to the f7-pawn while she prepares to attack with b2-b3 and c3-c4. Black decided to minimize her losing chances by trading rooks with 4 ... f6 5 ♖xf6 ♖gf8 6 ♖xf8 ♕xf8. But White was at least equal and following 7 ♘d3 ♕f5 8 ♘f4 ♕c2 she should have played to win with 9 e6! (9 ... ♕f5 10 b3! and c3-c4) rather than head for the draw as she did (9 ♕e2 ♕xe2 10 ♘xe2).
25. It's tempting to try 1 ... gxf5 2 ♕xf5 and defend against ♕xh7 mate with 2 ...
♘f6. Then 3 ♗g5 ♖e8! allows Black to escape and win. But this overlooks 3 ♗h6!, which threatens 4 ♕g5+ and ♕g7 mate. Then on 3 ... ♔h8 White has 4 ♗g5! with mate to follow ♗xf6+. Even if you didn't see all that, 1 ... ♗g5! was a good positional choice. Black got the edge after 2 ♕g4 ♗xc1 3 ♖axc1 ♘g7! (not 3 ... ♘xb2 4 ♘e7+) 4 ♘xg7 ♔xg7 and won the good-♘-vs.-bad-♗ position.
26. Black deserves more than perpetual check (1 ... ♔xg7 2 ♕g5+ ♔h8 3 ♕f6+).
But he shouldn't allow 2 ♗f6 or 2 ♕g5. The right response to the sacrifice was 1 ... ♕f5!. Black had the edge af ter 2 ♗h6 ♖e2! 3 ♕g5+ ♕xg5 4 ♗xg5 ♗e5! 5 ♖d1 ♗xb2 (or 5 ♖b1? ♗d4+!) and won the endgame.
27. Not 1 ... h6?, which loses to 2 ♗xh6! (2 ... ♘g8 3 ♗g5+ ♘h6 allows 4 f6!).
Once again the saving move is 1 ... ♔g8!. White grabbed the pawn, 2 ♗xf6 ♗xf6 3 ♕xh7+ ♔f8, lost the initiative after 4 ♕h8+ ♔e7 5 ♕h5 ♖d7 6 ♖e1+ ♔d8 7 ♖xe8+ ♔xe8 8 ♕h8+? ♔e7, and allowed Black a winning counterattack following 9 ♘d1 d4 10 ♕g8 ♕e5. There were better ways to play after 2 ♗xf6 but White might have been content to play 2 ♖g3, threatening ♗xf6. Then Black has nothing better than 2 ... ♔h8 - after which 3 ♖h3! ♔g8! leads to a draw by repetition (Not 2 ... ♔f8? 3 ♗h6!).
28. The position would be tactically dangerous if ♘xe7 or e6xf7 deliv ered check.
Black's 1 ... ♔h8! eliminated the checks. It had an additional benefit of threatening to trap the White bishop with ... ♘g8 and ... f6. For example, 2 ♖ad1 ♘g8! 3 ♘xe7 ♘xe7 4 ♗xe7 f6!. White replied 2 e5 dxe5 3 fxe5 but 3 ... ♘xd5! 4 ♘xd5 ♕xc6 was good. Now 5 ♘xe7?? is not check and allows 5 ... ♕xg2 mate. Play went 5 e6! because 5 ... fxe6 6 ♘f4! would have exploited the king's position at h8. Black played 5 ... ♘e5! and won after 6 ♖xe5? ♗xe5 7 exf7 (not check!) ♖f8 8 h3? ♖xf7 9 ♘f4 ♖xf4!. Afterwards it was pointed out that 6 ♗h6! was the right way: 6 ... f6 7 ♖xe5! fxe5 8 ♖f1 threatens ♖f7 (8 ... ♖f8? 9 ♗xg7+ ♔xg7 10 ♕xe7+). Black's best is the equality of 8 ... ♕xe6 9 ♘c7.
29. With 1 ... h5! Black halted White's kingside plans and created the prospect of
... ♘g4. Play went 2 ♔b1 ♘b6! 3 ♘d2? ♘g4! 4 ♗xe7 ♕xe7 and after 5 ♘f1 ♖xc3! 6 bxc3 d5 7 ♕e2 O-O Black had a winning attack.
30. Why give White chances when you can force at least a draw with 1 ... ♖c2! (2
♘xc2? ♗xc2+ and 3 ... ♕xe3). The game went 2 b3 ♗xb3! 3 axb3 ♖c3 with a draw, in view of 4 hxg7 ♖xb3+ 5 ♘xb3 ♕xb3+ 6 ♔a1! ♕a3+ (not 6 ♔c1? ♖c8+ 7 ♔d2 ♖c2+ and wins).
31. Both the overprotective 1 ... g6 and 1 ... ♕f7 2 ♕h3 ♗g6 3 ♕g4 ♔g8 (as Black
played) are good. But 1 ... ♗g6? just drops a piece (2 ♕xg6). And 1 ... ♗f7? is also bad because it would give Tal a chance to be Tal. He would start with 2 ♖xh7+ ♔xh7 3 ♖h1+ ♔g8 4 ♘g4!, which threatens ♘h6+. After 4 ... ♗e7 5 ♕h3 White would threaten ♕h8 mate as well as ♘h6+/ ♕xd7. This could have been one of Tal's greatest combinations: 5 ... ♔f8 6 ♗h6! ♗g8 7 ♗xg7+! ♔xg7 8 ♖g1! ♔f8 9 ♕h6+ ♔f7 10 ♘e5+! and mates.
32. It's not perpetual check because 2 ... ♔h8 3 ♕f6+ ♔g8 4 ♘f5! forces Black
to give up his queen. Black defended well with 1 ... ♕g4! 2 ♗xf6 c5! 3 ♘c2 ♕g6!. He confused White's pieces with 4 ♖f1 ♗e4 5 ♘e3 ♖ae8 6 h3 ♖e6! 7 ♘g4 h5! and won.
33. He can steal the initiative with 1 ... ♖c8+! 2 ♘xc8 ♕c7+!. Then 3 ♔d2 would
be met by 3 ... ♕a5+! 4 ♔c1 ♖xc8+. White chose 3 ♔b1 but Black had the edge following 3 ... ♖xc8 4 ♖6f2 ♗e6 7 ♕h5 b5 and 8 ... ♕a5.
34. With 1 ... ♔f7? Black leaves his king in potential danger after 2 ♖xe5 (2 ...
♔g8 3 ♕h4 and ♗f6). Black escaped to the queenside with 1 ... ♔d6! 2 dxe5+ ♔c7 and won after 3 e6 ♖g8 4 ♗f4+ ♗d6 5 ♗xd6+ ♔xd6 6 ♖d1+ ♔c7 7 ♕f4+ ♔c8. No better is 2 ♕f4 ♖g8! 3 ♖xe5 ♔d7 4 ♕f5+ ♔c7.
35. The a-pawn will cost White a piece and result in an Exchange-up ending with
two pawns apiece on the kingside. The knight should be left at bl so it can be sacrificed on a3 after ... a3. But in the game White lost after 1 ♘d2? ♖b2 2 ♔e3 a3 3 ♗f7 (otherwise the a-pawn queens) a2 4 ♗xa2 ♖xa2 5 ♘f3 ♔g8 6 ♔f4 ♖a4+ 7 ♔f5 ♖a3. The bishop defends better than the short-range knight because it can 'pass' and avoid zugzwang. The rest was 8 ♔f4 ♔f7 9 h5 ♔e6 10 g4 ♖a4+ 11 ♔g3 ♖b4 12 ♘h4 ♔e5 13 ♘f5 ♖b7 (zugzwang) 14 ♔h4 ♔f4 15 ♘d4 ♖b4 16 ♘e2+ ♔f3 17 ♘g1+ ♔g2! 18 ♘e2 ♖b1 19 ♘g3 ♖a1 and White resigned be cause a knight move allows 20 ... ♖h1 mate.
36. With 1 ... h3! and 2 gxh3 ♔e6 he reaches the queening square area and draws.
No better is 2 g4 ♔e6 3 ♔g3 ♔f6 4 ♔xh3 ♔g6, a book draw.
37. Black played 1 ... ♖g6+? 2 e6 and was close to losing. She completed the
collapse with 2 ... ♖g2 3 ♖xf3 ♖d2+ 4 ♔e7 and resigned when she realized the Lucena position was near. Black can draw with 1 ... f2! 2 ♖xf2 ♖a3! and giving checks on the a-file (or 3 ♖c2 ♖a6+ 4 ♖c6 ♖a8). Even after 1 ... ♖g6+? 2 e6 ♖g2 3 ♖xf3 she could have drawn with 3 ... ♖a2! 4 e7 ♖a6+!.
38. The active 1 ... ♖d8! ensures he can double rooks on the seventh rank. That
alone is not enough to draw, as 2 ♖xa7 ♖dd2 3 ♖a3 showed. Now 3 ... ♖xf2 regains a pawn but enables White, with 4 ♖g3+ ♔f8 5 a3! to keep the more valuable a-pawn. A much clearer path to a draw was 3 ... ♔f8!. White had nothing better than 4 ♖f1 ♖xa2 5 ♖xa2 ♖xa2, reaching a 3-to-2 pawn situation on the kingside. A draw was agreed soon after 6 g3 ♔g7 7 ♔g2 ♖b2 8 ♖a1 ♖c2 9 g4 h5! 10 gxh5 ♖c5 and ... ♖xh5 (or 10 g5 ♖c4 11 ♖a3 ♖g3+ 12 ♖g3 ♔g6).
39. With 1 e5+! ♔xe5 2 g4! White's secures a draw. Black's king cannot help
promote the a-pawn, 2 ... ♔d5 3 ♔g2 ♔c5 4 ♖a8 ♔b4 5 ♖a6 because 5 ... ♔b3 (threatening a rook move and queening) will be met by 6 ♖b6+. The other key point is that even if Black managed to achieve ... f5 and trade pawns, the result would look like this. If Black advances the g-pawn to g3 White will let it sit there (not ♔xg3?? because of ... ♖g1+ and queens). Black cannot make progress.
