Preface by John Nunn Attacking the enemy king is one of the most exciting parts of chess, but it is also one of the hardest to play accurately. Every chess player has had the experience of seeing a promising-looking attack crumble into dust, whereupon the enemy counter-attack sweeps aside everything in its path. Vukovic's excellent book The Art of Attack in Chess is a thought- provoking attempt to explain why some at- tacks succeed while other fail to reach their goal. The author himself points out that not everything in chess can be reduced to a set of rules, but the general prin- ciples he establishes in this book provide excellent guidance on when to launch an attack and how to ensure that it has the maximum chance of success. As usual with classic books I have edited, I will take a little time to explain ex- actly how I have prepared this new edition. First and foremost is the conversion to algebraic notation. In addition to this, I have added 1 28 extra diagrams and in some cases, where it seemed appropriate, I have added further moves from the quoted games (for example, by giving the actual finish instead of 'and White won in another ten moves'). I have lightly edited the rather ponderous English of the original translation, and brought the method of displaying variations into line with current practice. The index of the original book included only complete games, but I have also indexed the game excerpts. In two of the complete games, Alekhine-Asztalos and Alekhine-Kmoch, I have brought the moves of the game into line with the move-order given in the original tournament books. There are also a fair number of analytical footnotes (readers should note that where there is no room for a footnote on a particular page, the footnote appears on the following page). I hope readers will not form the opinion that Vukovic's analysis was especially unsound - this is certainly not the case. The fact is that most authors are prepared to quote the annotations of famous players uncriti- cally, but Vukovic brought his own talents to bear and subjected all the positions to careful analysis. Quite often the results were startling; in the well-known game Alekhine-Botvinnik, Nottingham 1936 he found a flaw which had eluded the many annotators who simply accepted the version of events Alekhine gave in the tournament book. Inevitably, the high percentage of original analysis implies a greater risk of the occasional slip, but personally I far prefer original comment to a bland recital of the 'party line'. In any case, it is Vukovic's general principles which will prove of most value to the practical player, and here there can be no argument about the enduring quality of his work. Introduction Action is the essential basis on which the game of chess is founded and any ac- tion which contains a threat - i.e. attack in its widest sense - stands out as a prom- inent feature of the game. To the outside observer, a chess game is dominated by the conflict between the two players. The ultimate aim of each player is, as a rule, the mating of the opponent's king, and an action with this aim, whether it is direct or indirect, is called an attack (in a narrower sense of the word) or a mating at- tack; that is the subject of this book. Being the most important action in chess and the central element of the game in ancient times, attack appears at all stages of the game's development and in various forms of perfection. Moreover, it can be said that the reforms which have been made in the rules of chess have always been in the direction of increasing and stimulating the opportunities for attack. The great reform of c. 1485, which created modern European chess, was par- ticularly responsible for opening up new opportunities for attack and ushered in a period of rich development in chess technique. For three centuries of chess his- tory, attack predominated over defence in the practice of the great players, and mastery at that time meant skill in conducting an attack. Only with Philidor did the first positional ideas appear, and with them more mature defensive strategies; these were to find in Steinitz a century later a legislator of genius. During the classic era of chess from Morphy to Steinitz and on to Lasker the value placed on attack gradually decreased, for with greater positional under- standing the foundations were also provided for the perfection of defensive technique. This, however, was followed by a new period in which Capablanca, and particularly Alekhine, perfected the technique of attack, above all that of the attack on the castled position, founded on exact positional play. With Alekhine the aggressive and dynamic style of play reached a zenith; in the period which followed the tide again turned away gradually from the risks of the direct attack in search of new paths. The main reason for this is not to be found in any weak- ness inherent in the attacking style, but in the simple fact that, given the condi- tions of present-day tournaments, it is more profitable and advantageous to make a study of openings. Now, it must be understood that the present theory of open- ings represents a detailed development of Nimzowitsch's ideas concerning the central squares. There are still many gaps to be filled and there is a wealth of op- portunity for innovation; as a result, great masters are inclined to concern Introduction 7 themselves intensively with openings and to opt for a 'safety-first' style. When this source of opening innovations begins to dry up, the problem of attack will present itself once more. The time may even come when the principles on which Alekhine built up his attacks will be completely understood, and those ideas which in the case of Alekhine had the appearance of a spark of genius will take on the more approachable aspect of attacking technique. It will be more conve- nient to discuss these questions at the end of the book. At this point it should be enough to point out that there exists an extremely large group of chess players, who are no longer beginners nor, on the other hand, masters or point-hunters, but players who aim primarily at deriving an aesthetic satisfaction from the game. For such players an attacking game is more attractive than positional technique and they will continue to attack regardless of risk, for their stormy contests are not going to be noted down in theoretical textbooks. So why should such play- ers not become acquainted with the general principles of attack and why should they not perfect themselves in that style of chess with which they are most at home? Various kinds of attack We have said that we shall deal with attack in its narrower, or proper, sense, where it involves a direct or indirect threat to the opponent's king. Attacks of this kind can be distinguished according to the following categories. 1 ) The main action is not in fact an attack on the king, but there is the possibil- ity of such an attack latent in the position; some threat or other is being nurtured, or else the attack is concealed in at least one variation. Let us take the following position as an example (D): The Art of Attack in Chess Here White makes the normal positional move 1 d4, which obviously does not represent an attack against the black king; but in one variation it contains the ele- ments of mate. That is, if Black is careless, and plays for example l..Bb7?, there then follows 2 dxc5, and Black has lost a pawn, since 2...Nxc5? is answered by 3 Rd4, attacking the knight and also threatening mate on g7. 2) A player's action really does contain a direct threat to his opponent's king, but his opponent can stave off this threat at a certain price, e.g. by giving up ma- terial or spoiling his position. The vast majority of attacks in fact fall into this very wide category. A simple example is given by this position: White plays 1 g5, carrying out an attack on h7. Black has three practical al- ternatives l...g6, l...Nf6, and l...Nf8. If l...g6, then 2 £}e4 with the threat of which gains a tempo; however, White's main plan will be a further attack based on the weaknesses on the dark squares in the region of the king arising from the move ...g6. If White will no doubt again continue his attacking play, e.g. with 2 Af4, preparing for Be5. However, on l...Nf8, attacking play does not promise success, and White will be content with a positional alternative, playing 2 £}e4. Then Black cannot really prevent 3 Nc5, after which the knight will have a strong position on c5 and the black bishop will be poorly placed on b7. 3) The attacker carries out an uncompromising mating attack, in which he can invest even a considerable amount of material, as long as he is certain of mating in the end. This is the third and highest degree of attack. We can categorize attack in another way if we take castling into account. Thus we have: Introduction 9 1) Attack before castling, i.e. against a king which has not yet castled, and 2) Attack against the castled king. Attack can also be divided on the basis of so-called mating patterns; of focal- points; of basic formations of pieces, files, ranks, and diagonals; of basic sacri- fices; as well as by the stage which the attack has reached. These divisions ac- cording to the spatial, material, and temporal aspects of an attack will help us arrange the material so as to reveal the part played by each factor. The basic pattern of mate For mate to be obtained, the king must be deprived of nine squares if it is in the middle of the board, six squares if it is on the edge, or four if it is in the corner. Some of these squares may be blocked by the king's own supporting pieces, but the rest must be taken by the attacker through the agency of his own pieces or pawns. If all the squares surrounding the king are taken from it - some through being blocked, others by being 'in check' - and if the square on which the king stands is also in check and without means of defence, then the king is check- mated. This is well known, and it seems rather banal to start out from this basic pattern or anatomy of mate; but in fact certain elementary rules can be formu- lated only on this basis. In the next position Black, to move, is unable to avoid mate in 4 different vari- ations. He is threatened by 2 .g7# (first mating pattern). If he plays there fol- lows 2 Bg7# (second mating pattern); moving the knight leads to 2 Re6# (third mating pattern); while if l...gxf5, we get 2 .g7+ Ne4 3 Rxd4# (fourth mating pattern).
10 The Art of Attack in Chess
The final or mating position is called the mating pattern, and this term is espe- cially useful when such a pattern is worth remembering. A mating pattern can be typical (i.e. one which frequently occurs) or atypical. We call a mate (or mating pattern) pure if none of the squares concerned is covered by two or more attack- ing units. Thus l...€)e2 2 Re6 is a pure mate, whereas l... f6 2 .g7 is not, though it would be if we were to remove the bishop on f5. Pure mates are valued in chess problems, but in practical play they are unimportant. In the mating patterns which we have seen, some of the black king's flight squares have been blocked by its own pieces, while the rest have been covered by the opponent's forces. The sum of these combined factors is known as a mating net. Mating square and focal-point The mating square is that on which the king stands when it is mated, and the mat- ing focal-point is that from which an opponent's piece (other than a king, knight or pawn) mates the king at close quarters. Thus in the above diagram, after L..£te2 the focal-point is e6, since it is from there that the queen mates at close quarters. Similarly, after l...gxf5 2 Jtg7+ Ne4 the queen mates at close quarters from d4, and that square is then the focal-point. However, if Black plays, for in- stance, 1...Bc3 and is answered by 2 .g7#, then we are dealing with a bishop at- tacking from a distance, and here the term 'focal-point' is not used. To carry out a mating attack successfully it is always useful to survey the pos- sible mating patterns, to prepare a mating net accordingly, and to concentrate on the focal-point. In this connection it is in many cases important to clear the fo- cal-point, that is to deprive any opposing pieces of their control over a square which would be convenient as a focal-point. The following diagram shows us an example of this (D): White, to move, observes correctly that the square d4 is a potential focal-point and that his queen could mate from there, if it were not for its being controlled by Black's knight and bishop. So he clears the focal-point d4 as follows: 1 2xe2 (eliminating the knight) l...dxe2 (if l... d5, then 2 f4#; if l...Wcl then 2 Rd4#, or if l...f4, then 2 Rd4+ Nf5 3 Rf6#) 2 f4+ (forcing the bishop away from d4) 2... xf4 3 Rd4#. Many readers will object that the patterns of mating attack shown here are so obvious, indeed banal, that they need not even have been mentioned. However, I think it is useful to strengthen just this simple kind of knowledge, since in fact there are many mistakes made precisely in this field. Here are a few instances of mistakes concerning mating patterns. Introduction 11 • The attacker fails to perceive that he can neither stop his opponent from mov- ing his king nor drive him into a mating net, but still plays for mate. Such a course of action is naturally futile, and though it may possibly produce perpet- ual check, it cannot produce mate. • The attacker plays on the basis of typical mating patterns, overlooking the pos- sibility of an 'atypical' one in a particular continuation. • The player sees all the possible mating patterns based on one focal-point, but fails to realize that all this is cancelled out when the king moves, and that what matters then are new mating patterns, for which he has not made preparations. • The player decides on a course of action based on a certain focal-point, with- out realizing that he cannot provide cover for it or even clear it of the influence of his opponent's pieces. Mistakes made in the selection of a focal-point will be found even in the games of the masters. So it is useful to get to know the general pattern and structure of mating; less experienced players are especially recommended to study games to see whether a player has made a mistake with regard to the pattern and, if so, where he has made it. The art of the mating attack We must now make some finer distinctions, and put a series of questions which arise out of the basic conceptions of a mating attack, and which at the same time also touch on the most difficult departments of the art of chess today. How does a mating attack relate to the other operations which take place in a game of chess? How much is a mating attack conditioned by the actual position on the chess- board, and how much by the skill of the attacker?
12 The Art of Attack in Chess
Where does the risk attached to a mating attack lie? About which points are the minds of players today still unclear with respect to carrying out a mating attack? The relationship between these questions can be easily perceived, although they are posed separately. A separate reply, however, cannot be given to each, and an attempt must be made to answer them collectively. Mate is the final aim and crowning achievement of the contest and the mating attack is the ultimate operation in relation to all the rest, which are only contribu- tory. Consequently, the mating attack demands more preconditions than other operations. There exist a number of definite preconditions for a mating attack, and these combine to require a considerable degree of superiority on the part of the attacker. In the case where he has abundant superiority, great knowledge and ability on the part of the attacker are not necessary, but if his superiority just bor- ders on what would justify a correct attack, then the maximum skill is also re- quired in carrying out the attack. The Romantics knew little, but they had great confidence in themselves; the first small increase in knowledge diverted their style from its course. The new formula, still accepted today, is: carry out a series of preliminary operations, which require only a smaller degree of advantage, and then you will attain the abundant superiority which facilitates a mating attack. However the consequence of this is that there has been a failure to exploit the art of attack to the full and masters have been over-inclined to see a risk in an attack. It is still not clear what the minimum preconditions are, or what kind of advan- tage is necessary, for a mating attack. It may be a question, for example, of a sin- gle moment in a game which never returns. Another still unresolved question is that of a player's skill in weighing up the obligations which he has undertaken when preparing for an attack. The order of his preparatory moves is extraordi- narily important. The only really simple thing is the principle itself - that moves entailing fewer obligations should be carried out before those which are more strongly binding. Putting this principle into practice, however, demands great skill of a kind which is very rare - it was fully possessed by Capablanca and Alekhine, but by few others. A few more words should be said about the kind of superiority which is neces- sary before a mating attack can be undertaken. We are interested in the case where the advantage is not one of material but of position and time. The attacker is, as a rule, stronger in the area where the attack takes place by virtue of his ma- terial preponderance there, but his superiority in this respect must be consider- able. Even a simple pattern with the queen mating from the focal-point needs at least one other piece to cover the focal-point, which already means an advantage of two pieces against a lone king. For such pieces to be brought into the attack, Introduction 13 together with any further attacking pieces which may be necessary, one must also have a temporal advantage, that is, the ability to carry out a series of attack- ing moves without one's opponent being able to organize either a direct defence or a sufficiently strong counterattack. A temporal advantage of this kind is usu- ally based on the attacker's positional advantage, i.e. by the comparative lack of mobility of his opponent's pieces for defensive purposes. The attacker often does not possess such outstanding overall superiority at the commencement of his at- tack, but it may manifest itself later as a consequence of the immobility of some of the defending pieces or through a particular attacking combination. The skill of perceiving the right moment to launch one' s attack in fact consists of making a correct assessment of possibilities such as these. All these points go to show that the correct launching of an attack is the cru- cial difficulty which has caused so many masters to turn away from the attacking style. They would rather try to obtain something through positional technique, where the downside is nothing worse than a draw; all too often this is exactly what they do achieve. Still, if advancement in the art of attack is neglected, if op- portunities for a perfectly feasible attack are passed by, how are games going to be won when technique comes up against technique? Without exploring the art of attack more deeply, there can be no further advance in chess. Attack is an es- sential component of the game of chess; it is a spark which smoulders in every corner and only the player who knows how to keep it alive and make it burst into flame at the right moment has reached the heights of true mastery. Lasker once acutely observed that if there is ever any possibility of an attack one must carry it out, since otherwise one's advantage will evaporate.
1 The attack against the
uncastled king Making a mating attack on a king which had not yet castled was one of the joys of chess players in the past. These days the victim of such an attack is usually some- one playing a master in a simultaneous display who has failed to castle at the right time. The initial position of the king before it castles contains two main weaknesses. One is that it is exposed if the e-file is opened up; the second is that the square f7 in Black's position (f2 is the corresponding weak point for White) is vulnerable, since it is covered by the king alone. It is therefore natural that the vast majority of attacks on an uncastled king exploit one of these weaknesses. The attack along the e-file The first and most fundamental condition for an attack along the e-file is that the opponent's king should be on that file, and that for some reason it is impossible or difficult for it to move away. If all the adjacent squares are occupied by the king's own pieces or controlled by the opponent's, its escape is absolutely impos- sible. However, if the player is simply being prevented from castling, but other squares are not covered, the movement of the king is only relatively restricted; in other words, it can move at the cost of losing the right to castle. Castling can also be thwarted indirectly; for instance, if the king has to guard one of the pieces which is protecting it (e.g. on e7 in Black's case). The second condition for an attack of this kind depends on the attacker's own circumstances. First of all, the e-file should be open, or it should at any rate be in the attacker's power to open it; the attacker should also either have a piece which can control a file (a rook or queen) on the file or be able quickly to post one on it. Besides this, he usually needs to strengthen his pressure on the e-file, for instance by doubling rooks or by attacking one of his opponent's pieces which is on the file and protecting the king. From these necessary conditions it transpires that in an attack along the e-file there tends to be a chain of defence, and the attack is carried out against the cen- tral unit of the chain, that is, the piece protecting the king. If this piece is on the square directly in front of the king (e7 or e2), the attacker may be able to mate by The attack against the uncastled king 15 capturing it with his queen (or rook), i.e. by making the square into the focal- point. An attack on the e-file tends to occur most frequently at an early stage of the game. The following miniature is an example of how rapidly this kind of attack may develop after an opening mistake: Meesen - H. Muller Correspondence Game, 1928/9 English Opening

A good move, which counters White's plan (Xg2 and O-O) by attacking along the e-file. If White were now to play 8 e3, such an attack would admittedly not follow, but he would still be weakening his position. 8 i.g2 Na6 9 Rd3 d5 10 b3 d4! (D) An interesting move; Black abandons his attack on the e-file for the time be- ing, transferring his pressure to the weakened diagonal a5-el . If White now takes the c6-pawn and then the a8-rook, Black can win a piece by ...jLxc3+ and JLxal.

16 The Art of Attack in Chess
opening up of the file, especially if everything else has already been achieved, as, for example, in the following game: Chigorin - Burn Ostend, 1906 King's Gambit Declined Nb3 (D) This position contains the three elements already referred to (king on el, queen on e2 and the black rook on e8), and it is only a question of opening up the e-file. This aim can be promoted by the sacrifice of Black's bishop on f5:
9..Bxf5!
After 10 exf5 e4, the important point is that White cannot avoid opening up the e-file since removing his knight would be followed by 11...exd3. But if Black had played more weakly with 9...dxe4? 10 dxe4 Bxf5 11 exf5 e4, he would have lost the chance of playing ...exd3, and White could have moved his knight and avoided opening up the file. The play after 10...e4 is no longer of interest; White could still try 11 dl exf3 12 Rxf3, after which 12... e5 followed by 13...£}g4 or 13...d4 would lead to a great advantage for Black. In the game itself, White declined the sacrifice by 10 Bg5, but lost quickly:
10...dxe4 11 dxe4 .Nxe4 12 Rc4 Rd5 13 Rb5 .f2+ 0-1
If the e-file is already open and the last defender is a piece on e2 (or e7 for Black) then the operation often takes the form of a systematic attempt to The attack against the uncastled king 17 undermine the defence of the critical square, thus making e2 into a focal-point. The following diagram gives an example of this kind of operation: This position is from the game Hansen-Lundin, Oslo 1928.

Alternatives were 3 O-O-O Nxe2+ and 3 2dl xe2-l-, etc.

This position supplies a convenient example of the method of play against a piece protecting the king. White, to move, must discover the correct way to increase his pressure against the bishop on e7. He would not achieve enough by 1 Re2 f8 2 Bxe7+ £}xe7 3

White's only correct move is: In this way White not only prevents Black from castling but also stops him from countering with ...f6.

A rook sacrifice of this type is often necessary if an attack along the e-file is to be forced home. It is essentially a question of freeing the square el for the second rook, while the first, in being sacrificed, eliminates one of the pieces defending e7\

White's play in the following position (Ravinsky-Panov, Moscow 1943) is an excellent example of a well-conducted attack along the e-file. 1 2 Rd3! is even more convincing. Black can only prevent the deadly 3 Sxe7+ Nxe7 4 Sei by 2... d7, but after 3 Rb5+ his position collapses immediately. In Vukovic's main line, 4...O-O-O 5 jLxe7 Sde8 would enable Black to fight on.

At this point Steinitz's opponent left the tournament hall and never reap- peared. By these offensive means he hoped to deprive Steinitz of 'a piece of im- mortality', but the textbooks have noted White's intentions all the same:

Rg7+ *e8 31 Rg8+ 4>e7 32 Rf7+ Nd8 33 Rf8+ Re8 34 Nf7+ <Nd7 35 Rd6# The attack on the square f7 Black's weakest square on the board before castling is f7 (f2 for White). Even in the opening stages, threats of a sacrificial assault on f7 (or f2) are common; they are usually connected with an attack on the king or even with the idea of mate, in which case the square becomes the focal-point of a mating attack. Later on, after castling kingside, the rook protects this vulnerable square and its weakness is greatly diminished, while after castling queenside the weakness of the square has no connection with a mating attack. The most straightforward examples of assaults on f7 are to be seen at the be- ginning of certain open games, especially in the Petroff Defence and the Philidor Defence. We shall examine one example of this kind:
1 e4 e5 2 f3 d6 3 Nc4 <Ne7?
Let us allow Black to play this bad move so as to reach a typical crisis over the square f7 as quickly as possible.

Naturally, various attacks can be made on the uncastled king other than via the e-file or f7; these are only two of the commonest and most typical methods. The T1 The Art of Attack in Chess following example shows how a threat along the e-file can be indirectly com- bined with pre-castling attacks of another kind. Keres - Kotov Budapest Ct, 1950 Sicilian Najdorf

An alternative was to let the e-file be opened up by 11...Nxd5 12 exd5 Rf5 13 Eel+ Ne5 14 f4, which would perhaps have been less unpleasant for Black, e.g.

A few further examples will show different aspects of the attack against the square f7 :

A sacrificial assault on f7 must as a rule be followed up by aggressive action, so as not to allow Black time to consolidate (e.g. with an artificial castling by means of ...Sf8 and ...Ng8). The advantage of the capture is twofold: the king, in moving to f7, loses the right to castle and is exposed still further; at the same time, a weakness appears on the diagonal h5-e8. Such features should be quickly and energetically exploited, since they are on the whole of a transitory nature.

2 The attack on the king that has
lost the right to castle This situation arises when the king is either no longer able to castle or has been driven by the opponent away from the castling area. In spite of these possible dif- ferences of origin, the general picture and the problem involved are identical and ought to be dealt with in one and the same chapter. First of all, it must be emphasized that the actual fact that a king has lost the right to castle does not necessarily always justify undertaking an attack aimed at mate (as will be shown by the examples of the voluntary loss of castling rights in chapter three). For an attack of this kind to be feasible, the loss of castling rights must at the same time involve the exposure of the king and an increased vulnera- bility to attack. In the majority of cases the attack is in fact in order, and we shall only consider such positive cases and not the rest. It only remains to be added that the loss of the right to castle can also entail a further weakness besides the danger which faces the king; that is, communication between the rooks is made more difficult. In fact, an attack may logically direct itself against this lack of co- operation between the rooks, e.g. in a struggle for control of an open file. We shall first examine a few typical examples portraying the drama of the king which has lost the right to castle. Such a drama can be divided up into the follow- ing episodes: 1) spoiling the king's castling chances, or drawing it away from the castling position; 2) the pursuit of the king across the board by checking; and 3) the final mating attack in the middle of the board or on the edge. The following game is an illustration of just such a drama in three acts: Potemkin - Alekhine St. Petersburg, 1912 Closed Sicilian
1 e4 c5 2 g3 g6 3 Ng2 Ng7 4 Ne2 5 c3 f6 6 Na3? d5 7 exd5 Nxd5 8
Nc2 O-O 9 d4 cxd4 10 cxd4 .g4 11 f3 Jkf5 12 Ne3 Ra5+ The king is forced to move out of position (1st act). 13 *f2 The attack on the king that has lost the right to castle 29 Unavoidable, since if 13 Bd2, then 13... xe3 144Lxa5 Nxdl, and Black wins a piece; this also happens after 13 Rd2 xe3 14 Rxa5 £}xg2+, etc.
13...Ndb4 14 2>xf5 Rxf5 15 g4 Nd3+
The second act (a short one) starts: the king has to move again. White decides on 16 igS?, a weak move, but even after the stronger 16 stfl, Black retains the advantage with 16...Rb5.
16 Ng3? (D)
16,..Nxd4! 17 gxf5 £}xf5+ 0-1 as Black mates in 2 moves : 18 Ng4 h5+ 19 Nh3 (or 19 Ng5 4Lh6#) 19...£tf2# (As an old chess player said on a similar occa- sion, 'He's lucky to be mated, otherwise he would lose his queen...'). We called hunting the king about the board 'the second act of the drama' . However, it must be stressed that it is not the actual fact that the king has to move about that is of prime importance, but the extent to which its position is weak- ened. Instead of travelling all over the board it may happen that the king merely roams a little and gets itself tied up in a small space of two or three squares, while the opponent harries it with checks and thus manages to bring up his pieces with gain of time. A typical case where checks help to 'nourish the development of the attack' arises in the following short game: Clemens - Eisenschmidt St Petersburg, 1890 Evans Gambit

Rb4fia49Wxb6 xdl, and Black won on the basis of his material superiority. The pursuit of a king that has lost the right to castle is not, however, always such a successful undertaking as in the examples quoted. There have in fact been many occasions when the hunted king has come out the winner by successfully escaping to safety, and when the whole of his flight turns out in the end to be arti- ficial castling on a large scale/ A player who is pursuing a king in such circumstances must therefore keep his eyes open to make sure that the prey does not elude him. Two factors are particu- larly important: the tempo of the attack and slowly but surely building up a mat- ing net from which the king has no escape. As a matter of fact, this net is often of more importance than tempi, and quiet moves which 'spin the threads' often point the correct way, whereas many juicy checks may prove to be mistakes. The position of the king that has lost the right to castle represents, as it were, the at- tacker's capital, which he has acquired at the price of sacrifices or positional dis- advantages. The attacker should retain his hold on this capital without worrying too much about 'short-term gains' in the form of tempting checks; the decisive point in the end is whether the king is going to fall or not. These remarks are intended to inspire the reader to be cautious in his pursuit of a king that has lost the right to castle. Two maxims here oppose each other: the first instructs one to keep up the tempo of the attack by means of checks in order to give the king no time to recover its breath; the second warns that it is important
34 The Art of Attack in Chess
to finish off the pursuit by cornering the king and forcing it into a mating posi- tion. In practice players struggle to find a balance between these two maxims and on their correct choice success itself depends. Now that the problem is clear, it will be examined in a series of practical examples. Smyslov-Florian and Belavenets-Chistiakov are cases where the building of a mating net takes precedence over the pursuit of the king. In Tarta- kower-Euwe, however, we shall see the opposite, with Euwe hunting his oppo- nent's king without giving it a moment's respite. In the game Chigorin-Caro we have an illustration of when a king's pursuit should be halted and its retreat cut off, or, conversely, what happens if an opportunity to 'fix' the king is lost and it reaches a position of safety, as in fact occurred in this game.

A fine example of a consistent pursuit of the king. The following unusual game, which dates from long ago, gave rise to amuse- ment at the tournament itself and only superficial comments in the tournament book. Chess books concerned themselves with the game no further, and in doing so let slip some fine material with which to illustrate the theme of 'the king's wanderings and flight'. Only with the commentary below, containing a discus- sion of the king's journey and an exposition of the technique of 'net-building', has this game been placed in correct perspective.

A risky move, first played by Steinitz against Blackburne in 1876. Correct here is 12gxf3 on which Black can get a draw with 12...Wel+ 13 f4 Rh4+, etc. Chigorin, in playing 12 Bb5+, avoids this possibility, for a draw was naturally Nxf3 12 Nb5+ not to his liking.
12...c6 13 gxf3 (D)

The co-creator of the Caro- Kann Defence departs from the theory of his time and hits on the very best move. The theoreticians of the day rejected it, probably because Caro lost the game, and noted in their books that Black obtains the ad- vantage by continuing 13...cxb5 14 Rxe4 Rxe4+ 15 xe4 O-O 16 Jte3 £ki7. However, it seems that these old masters either examined this position by feeble gas-light or else they supposed that White would now have to succumb by play- ing 1 7 Sad 1? <53xe5 18 xe5 Sfe8+ 19 f4 g5+. However, by modern reckoning White would have the better game, if he were to play consistently for a central position with 17 jtd4. In view of the threat of 18 Sabi a6 19 a4, Black's best re- ply is 17...a6; then there follows 18 Shgl with the intention of weakening Black's position on the long dark diagonal.
14 Nxe4
Chigorin takes a further risk; 14 Ne2 would have been good enough for a draw after 14...Rh3 (not 14...exf3+on account of 15 Nf2 Rh3 16 Jlfl!) 15 Sdl exf3+ 1 4 fxe5 usually transposes to the game continuation after 4... xe4 5 d3 b4. White has other possibilities at move 5, but none gives him any advantage.

After 20 Bxb4 (20 cxb4 O-O 21 b5 Efe8 is in Black's favour) 20...Nxb4 21 cxb4 O-O the exposed position of White's king together with his scattered pawns gives Black a considerable ad- vantage.

The queen's great manoeuvrability comes into its own in situations like this.

20 .d6 also came into consideration, though 20...f6 would then have led to a difficult and unclear position.

1 In fact 21 Wfl Nd7 can be met by 22 Rd3+ and White escapes into a playable
ending. 21 Wfl is best answered by 21...Nxe5 and White cannot exploit the line-up on the e-file because his own king is so exposed. The attack on the king that has lost the right to castle 41
21.. >g5+ 22 f4
White has to consent to this move, which exposes his king still further; 22 is not good on account of 22...Rh4+ 23 ifl (neither 23 Ne3 Rh6+ nor 23 stgl Hd2 is any better) 23...Rh3+ 24 Nf2 Rxh2+ 25 si?e3 Rd2+ 26 4*64 g5 and Black wins.

The opening up of the e-file is of no help to White, since his king has nowhere to go; in view of the threat of mate he is forced to play 26 f5, on which 26...£te5 wins.
23...Rh3+ 24 *e4
To engineer a possible escape for the king via d2 White would have to give up his h-pawn; moreover, there would also be a permanent danger of the exchange of queens. For this reason he prefers to embark on new adventures.
24..J5+ 25 *d5 (D)
This position caused amazement among some of the spectators, who attempted to get the manager of the tournament to intervene, since it was clear that White's piece on d5 was his queen and that on bl his king! The position is, of course, a strange one; what is also unusual is that within seven moves the white king has reached al. Clearly, it is helped in this by Black, who checks unnecessarily in- stead of building up a mating net. Black played 25...Rg2+?, when the correct move was 25...Hc8!. In that case White's king would get into trouble on the c- file, which it would have to cross to extract itself from the scrape it has got into. The following variations illustrate the strength of the rook move and are at the same time instructive as regards play against an exposed king: 25..JJc8! and now:
42 The Art of Attack in Chess
1) White carries out a counterattack with his queen: 26 Rxb7 wg2+ 27 Qc5 Ne7+ 28 Nb6 Ec6+ 29 Na7 Rf2+ 30 Na8 O-O+ 31 Bb8 Sb6 and Black wins. 2) The white king tries to force its way through to the al -corner; this gives rise to the most interesting point in the analysis. After 26 c4 Black does not try any checking moves, but instead first consolidates his own position by 26...g6!!, having observed that White has no good move to make. If 27 Sc2 or 27 Rc2, then 27,..b5+ 28 Nb3 d4+, while if 27 Scdl, then 27... d4+; if 27 Sedl or 27 Ifl, the ring is tightened by 27...Re3, and if T1 Rb6, then 27...<Na5+ 28 Nd5 (or 28 Nb4 Rxh2 !) 28...Rg2+ 29 e6 Rxa2+ 30 ?f6 (or 30 c4 £}xc4, etc.) 30...Sc6

mates . The possibility of 27 Nb3 still remains. There is admittedly no mating net then, but with 27...Rxh2 Black obtains a material advantage and goes on to threaten both 28...Rxf4 and 28... a5+ followed by ...£te4. 3) The white king tries to defy the danger of mate by advancing to b6. Black then has a number of continuations, the simplest of which seems to be 26 c5 Rxh2 27 bb fxf4 28 Nxb7 (if 28 Rb3, then 28...Rf2+ 29 .c5 Rxc5+ 30 <Nxc5 Na5+ with a won ending) 28...Rc4 29 xc8 b4+ 30 <Nb7 Rb5+ 3 1 ?a7 £106+ followed by 32...'Nd7+ and mates. The actual game took the following course:
25...Rg2+? 26 Nc4 b5+ 27 Nd3 Rf3+ 28 <Nc2 Rf2+ 29 Nb3 Sc8 (D)
1 In this line Vukovic fails to take his own advice and gives too many checks,
which actually allow White to escape by 34 <Nh6! Rxh2+ 35 Si?g5 Rg3+ 36 Nf6, etc. The correct continuation is 32..,Re6! and there is no way to meet the threat of 33...Hg8+ 34 Nh6 g5+. The attack on the king that has lost the right to castle 43
30 Sc2
White obviously cannot play 30 Rxf5 since then 3O...£3a5+ leads to mate; in- stead, he gives up his f-pawn and then by retreating his king quickly to al safe- guards his position.
30.,.Nxf4 31 Nb2 2Ba5 32 Nal Rc4?
A further mistake; he could still have fought for a draw by 32. ..Rf3!. The square c4 is naturally more suitable for the knight. 33 e6 After 33...Hc6 34 Nb7 35 Be5 Black cannot play 35...Sxe6 because of 36 .xg7 Sg8 37 Sxe6+ and White wins.
34 Wdl h5?
A terrible move; he should have played 34...fid8.
35 Sgl! fih7 36 fixg7! 1-0
Since if 36...Bxg7, then 37 Rxh5+ followed by 38 Rh8+ and White forces mate. In addition to this strange game, I shall extract from the treasury of chess curi- osities three more encounters which have particular relevance to the theme of a king's successful wandering. The series opens with a game between Hamppe and Meitner, in which the pursued king seeks asylum among the enemy pawns and is successful to the extent that the opponent cannot obtain anything beyond perpet- ual check. Hamppe - Meitner Vienna, 1872 Vienna Game

3 Nf3, which was often played by Anderssen, is the soundest answer to
2...Bc5. Hamppe's move is of doubtful value because of the bishop sacrifice on
3... .xf2+
In return for the bishop, Black obtains a promising attack on the king, which is deprived of the right to castle. 4 <Nxf2 Rh4+ 5 Ne3 If 5 g3 then 5...Rxe4 6 Re2 xa4 (not 6...Wxhl because of 7 £M'3 and 8 Ag2) 7 xe5+ Ne7 8 Rxg7 Sg8 9 ?xh7 d6 and Black has the better position.

This illustrates the method of countering a king's planned withdrawal to safety.
7.. .Rxe4 8 Nb3
If 8 d4 then 8...£te6 9 Nb5 (or 9 b3) 9...exd4+ and Black has three pawns for his bishop as well as good prospects for a continuing attack on White's king or, indeed, his knight on a4.
8...Na6 9 a3 (D)
9 c4? would be weak because of 9...b5!. Similarly, 9 Bxa6 bxa6 10 c3 Rxg2 1 11 f3 (or 11 Jlg4 12 Sei e7!) 11.. Bh3! is bad for White2. This is atyp- ical example of an attack against a displaced king being deferred on the grounds that further action would only help the consolidation of the king's position. Thus, for example, after 9 Bxa6 bxa6 10 c3, 10...Sb8+ would enable White to prepare a new home for his king on b2 by 1 1 Na3 and b3. Instead, Black directs his attack against the other flank and, while mowing down some pawns, tries to exploit the general lack of development of White's position.
9...Rxa4+!
Effective, and probably necessary, although it gives no more than a draw. If

29 gxh5 elW+ 30 Ng2 Se2+ 31 <Nh3 f5? Black has drawn his opponent's king out of position but now, when he is faced with the task of producing a mating attack, he stumbles. 31...f5? only appears to tighten the net (that is, by the threat of 32...W1+ 33 Sxfl Sxh2#); in fact it al- lows the king to escape via g5. 31...Wfl+ 32 Sxfl Sxh2+ 33 g4 would also have been unsound, since after 34 Ng3 ! Nxc6+ White can liquidate by in- terpolating 35 Sxd6+ cxd6 36 .b6+ and only then 37 xh2.
31...Rxc3+ 32 Sd3 (forced) 32...Re5 33 Rf3 e7, etc. was one line which
led to victory.

By sacrificing his rook White succeeds in blocking the g-file and thus obtain- ing a respite for his king in the comparative safety of g5. Naturally, the king is only secure there for one or two moves, but in the present position that is enough, for White also has some threats at his disposal. The initiative now passes to White, and he should win quickly. The creation of a 'makeshift shelter' for one or two moves is often extremely important when the king is being pursued, always on the assumption, of course, that the counterat- tack made possible by the gain of time promises to be successful.

Barnes played a number of games against Morphy; with his distinctive posi- tional style, he was the most successful of all the British masters against that combinative genius. Now comes the third and last example from the collection of curiosities - the game between Michelet and Kieseritzky, in which the hunted white king is not only saved but goes on actively to participate in the attack on his black colleague. The key to this success is the confinement of Black's queen in a most unusual 'cage'. Michelet - Kieseritzky Paris, 1845 King's Gambit Accepted

50 The Art of Attack in Chess
White actually encourages Black to carry out his threat to win the queen, pro- ducing an original riposte to it. White now wins the other rook, leaving the black queen boxed in at g2. White conducts the ending with what is in effect an extra piece and, logically enough, takes his king into battle as well . Nxe5 hxg3 31 Nf6 1-0 The final position deserves a diagram. Black is lost, since he has no proper defence against .g6+ followed by e7+ and e8W, etc. Black's play throughout this game is an example of how not to con- duct an attack on a wandering king.
3 On castling and attacking the
castled position in general The origin of castling Castling, the most distinctive move in the whole of chess, affects the nature of mating attacks in various ways and because of its importance in this connection, the general significance of the move is worth examining. Castling is not of any great antiquity. It is also obvious that such a complex and distinctive operation as the modern castling move was not born in a day, but rather developed gradually from century to century with the evolution of the rules of the game themselves. In the Indian game of chaturanga (pre-chess) there is no trace of the move, nor can it be found in the Arab shatranj. The first traces of any unusual or exceptional movement being made by the king, out of which the castling move evolved, are to be found in mediaeval European chess, which in its first stages can be de- scribed as the first and not very significant revision of shatranj towards providing the pieces with greater mobility. A historical source attesting to this first revision is a work by the Lombard monk Jacobus de Cessolis, in which are recorded the rules governing the movements of the individual chess pieces at the time. There it is stated that king, queen, and pawns have the right to make an initial move of two squares as well as the normal one. From this early reform the double opening step taken by the pawn survives to this day, while in the case of the queen it be- came obsolete when the piece was given its present powers of movement during the great reform of the game at the end of the fifteenth century. In the case of the king it was further developed and altered until it eventually took its present-day shape as castling. There is extensive confirmation of the introduction of the king's move from other sources after Cessolis, though the particular conditions governing the move vary. The form most frequently recorded is that where the king moves like a knight ('Freudensprung'), with the limitation that it is not allowed to go beyond the second rank. The next form, which made its appearance in Italy in the six- teenth century, already included a movement by the rook in the same move - a step nearer to the castling of today. The king's use of the knight's jump disap- pears at this point and the rules state that the king is free to move from el to gl or
52 The Art of Attack in Chess
hl and the rook from hl to fl or el. This type of 'free castling' or 'Italian cas- tling' persisted in Italy right up to the nineteenth century, when it was superseded by the present rules, which were introduced in France during the eighteenth cen- tury. This short survey of the historical evolution of castling is a good illustration of the gradual development of the rules of chess and it makes it particularly clear that these rules have been changed and perfected with the desire of enriching the game; the general tendency towards giving the pieces more dynamic movement reflects the increased animation of social movements in Europe from the Middle Ages onwards. In addition to this general line of development in the laws of chess, we also owe the introduction and eventual adoption of the castling move to the indirect influence of the great reform of the fifteenth century. This reform created a pow- erful queen out of thefers (which moved one square) and the modern bishop out of the alfil (which moved exactly two squares). In this new type of chess, with three long-range pieces, the fighting ability of the king declined; once in the days of pre-chess it had been the strongest piece of all. The king now became a hin- drance with its slow movement, and its position in the centre of the back rank stood out immediately as a fault in the game 's structure. On the one hand, it had to be safeguarded against the formidable new forces, and on the other it had to be removed from the centre so as not to hamper them. For this reason it was neces- sary for the king to get away from the centre as quickly as possible, and it was to this end that the king's double move was built on and transformed into the full castling move. Therefore, not only the development of this most distinctive move can be traced through the history of chess but also its logic: it exists as the neces- sary complement to the reform of the other pieces' movements. We start a game of chess today with the pieces placed in the ancient order which derives from chaturanga, and then we switch over by castling to a new position, which is better suited to the alterations made in the game's rules. The dynamic and positional significance of castling Chess moves in general can be looked at from the dynamic or the positional point of view, depending on whether we are considering them as part of an active com- bination or as static features. The castling move without doubt powerfully increases the dynamic potential of a position. A player who has castled at once obtains a whole range of possibili- ties which he did not have before. He has increased the influence of the rook, cleared the square el for a possible attack along the e-file, and on top of this he On castling and attacking the castled position in general 53 has prepared the ground for the quick establishment of 'communication between the rooks', i.e. the entire clearing of the back rank, as a result of which the rooks cover each other or can combine together in attacks. On the other hand, castling is also a positional move, and one which provides a particular element of permanency to the position. For it is unique and irrevoca- ble; it can only be carried out once in a game, which means that the king will as a rule stay on the side on which it has castled. In special cases it can, it is true, travel with a greater or lesser degree of difficulty from its castled position to vari- ous parts of the board. Thus castling is only relatively irrevocable (unlike a pawn's move, which is absolutely so) but for practical purposes the king's posi- tion after castling is, at least until the arrival of the endgame, fairly definitely a permanent positional feature. Before castling, the king has three possible courses of action: to remain in the middle or to castle either to right or left. Once it has castled it no longer has any choice; it then has a definite shelter, a 'permanent ad- dress', a fact which the opponent naturally takes into account. It is certainly safer against attack, but it has at the same time committed itself positionally to one par- ticular area of the board; thus the undoubted advantages of castling are offset by certain disadvantages. Artificial castling Chess also contains the term 'artificial castling', which involves a player creating a position the same as or similar to that reached after genuine castling. It is at- tained not by a single castling move but a series of moves by the king and the rook. In the continuation from the following diagram we shall encounter the sim- plest example of 'artificial castling.'

White's best would now be 2 Nxe4 d5 3 Bd3 dxe4 4 Bxe4, in which case the prospects would remain even. However, before taking the knight on e4 White de- cides to use his bishop to prevent his opponent from castling - an idea which, in this position, is faulty.
2 Nxf7+ <Nxf7 3 Nxe4
At first sight White's plan appears to have succeeded, since, as well as main- taining the material balance, he has prevented Black from castling. However, the further play shows that Black can carry out 'artificial castling' without difficulty and has made a clear gain in that he is left with strong pawns in the centre.
3...d5 4 g3 Sf8 5 d3 #g8
Now the superiority of Black's position is quite obvious, and one can easily appreciate the part played by 'artificial castling' ; Black has admittedly expended three moves on it, but White has derived no advantage from this fact, since he has made three moves of even less value, i.e. Bxf7+, Nxe4, and £3g3. In a sense, Black was castling while White was transferring his knight from c3 to g3. The correct moment for castling Beginners are often advised to castle as quickly as possible. This is a useful and sensible piece of advice in the majority of instances. Certainly, less experienced players offend against this general precept extremely often, postponing castling unnecessarily and as a result suddenly finding themselves in an awkward situa- tion, by which time it is far too late to castle. The present writer once made a sta- tistical survey of late castling using a number of simultaneous games and came to the conclusion that a common characteristic of so-called 'simultaneous massa- cres' (when the master wins all, or nearly all, of the games) was precisely the lateness of castling. Around the twelfth move of one such simultaneous display the situation was as follows: the master had castled on eighteen of the boards and not yet on two, while his opponents had castled on three boards but not on the rest. The result: 20-0 to the master - a real massacre! This is a typical example which indicates the disadvantages resulting from a delay in castling. In other si- multaneous displays, where masters had a harder task and poorer results, the sta- tistics on castling, taken around the twelfth to fifteenth moves, on the whole showed smaller discrepancies. The general rule that one should castle as soon as possible is therefore quite in order, though it must at once be emphasized that there are also many exceptions to it. Every chess player of greater experience is well acquainted with those On castling and attacking the castled position in general 55 particular situations when it is correct to postpone castling or when it is alto- gether unnecessary. To make the matter clearer, I shall set out some situations of this kind and support them with examples: 1 ) Castling is postponed or not carried out at all, because some other action is more useful. This might be quite simply the capture of an opponent's piece, the spoiling of his position, or, indeed, an attack. If such an attack is sufficiently strong and profitable, the attacker often never castles, because he is victorious first. This kind of situation needs no particular examples. 2) Castling is postponed, because for the time being it is still dangerous. It is better to prepare it by removing the danger first, e.g. by exchanging the oppo- nent's threatening pieces or by some other manoeuvre. As an example of the dangers of castling too early, let us take the following variation of the Giuoco Piano.
1 e4 e5 2 £tf3 c6 3 Nc4 Nc5 4 d3 <Nf6 5 Ng5 h6 6 Nh4 d6 7 O-O?
At this point castling is premature and incorrect. There is a danger of Black's replying ...g5 and following up with a pawn attack against White's castled posi- tion; this danger ought to be averted first. 7 Nc3 is a step in this direction; if Black continues with 7...O-O? 8 £ki5 g5, then White can reply 9 Nxg5! £W5 10 Rh5 hxg5 1 1 Bxg5 with an overwhelming attack. Moreover, if Black answers 7 with 7...g5 8 Bg3 and then ... .g4 or ...h5 !?, the situation is less dangerous because White has not yet castled and can therefore prepare to castle on the queenside, which is not threatened.
7...g5 8 Ng3 h5! 9 Nxg5 h4! (D)

Black does not worry about the consequences of Bxf7 but continues his attack consistently. In fact, he gives up his queen for the bishop on g3; this would not be

a good exchange if White had not castled, but against the castled position the at- tack is decisive.
10 Nxf7 hxg3 11 £}xd8
If 11 hxg3, then ll...Re7 12 Nxh8 Rh7 followed by ...£}g4, with a decisive attack.

Hg2+ 17 £hl Exf2+ 18 Ngl Eg2+ 19 £hl Sgl# 3) The player does not castle at once because, although he is able to castle on one side, he actually wishes to castle on the other side and needs to make further preparations. Alternatively, he delays until his opponent castles, and only then decides which side to castle. If he is aiming for an attack, he may decide to castle on the opposite side to his opponent; if he is aiming to forestall an attack, then he will more likely castle on the same side as his opponent. There are many examples in the games of the masters of this kind of pause be- fore castling. It is assumed, of course, that this pause does not entail any dangers. In open positions such dangers are more frequent than in closed ones. The following situation will serve as an example of this pause before castling. It is White's move and he may, if he wishes, castle short immediately. But he calculates as follows: after 1 O-O Black will play ...O-O, and then how can I attack him? The pieces by themselves can achieve nothing in this blocked position; h3 and g4 still need to be played and must be prepared by Rd2. But in the meantime Black will consolidate his position on the kingside (e.g. by means of ...g6 and ...Sf8-f7-g7) after which the attack will have lost its power. There is no doubt that for an attack based on g4, White's king is not well placed at gl, and it is better for that purpose to castle on the queenside and then deploy the rooks on the g- and h-files. However, if White chooses 1 Rd2 and then 2 O-O-O, Black can play On castling and attacking the castled position in general 57
2...O-O-O, whereupon the attack with g4 no longer applies; White will have to
play a hasty b4, in which case it will be quickly seen that his king is badly placed on cl. Consequently, he must put off castling and wait. White therefore plays 1 Re2, and if 1...O-O, then 2 O-O-O, while if 1...O-O-O, then 2 O-O. He castles on the opposite side from Black in order to get the maximum freedom for carrying out his attack. 4) Castling may be postponed, and perhaps forgone forever, in certain posi- tions where the centre is permanently blocked. The reason for being able to postpone castling in such positions is, of course, that the pawns form an obstruction in the centre and so make it impossible to open the central files and diagonals without painful sacrifices. With the centre blocked, the kings are also safer in the middle, at least for some time. The logical course of attack in such cases tends to be on the unblocked flanks, and there are times when the king is more exposed by being in a castled position on the wing than in the middle, where it is protected by the blocked pawns. A convenient example to illustrate this can be obtained by re-examining the above diagram, which we ought to do anyway because we left White's move 1 Re2 unanswered. Black's best reply also consists of a postponement of castling, e.g. I...a6 or l...£kl8. The postponement of castling is feasible for both sides in this position, and for a very obvious reason: the pronounced blockade in the cen- tre. Attacks can only take place down the flanks and as a result the kings are at the moment relatively safe in the middle. Play from this position might develop as follows:
1 Re2 Nd8 2 h3 f7 3 Rd2 O-O-O
It is less dangerous for Black to castle on the queenside now; if White plays 4 O-O, Black replies 4,..Edg8, threatening ...g5, while after 4 O-O-O the danger of an attack on the flank disappears and Black can relax. In this case the preliminary skirmish has in fact ended with castling, but there are blocked positions where castling does not occur at all and the kings stay per- manently in the middle. Even in the above position White has the alternative of not castling and instead co-ordinating his rooks by Nf2; later on he can even take his king up to e3. 5) Castling is unnecessary, because the endgame is already not far off, in which case the king is well placed in the middle of the board. These cases too are not infrequent in master chess; we shall select two exam- ples from opening theory, where the white king forfeits the right to castle as a re- sult of the exchange of queens.

White does not worry about castling, as the position is approaching an endgame and the king is fairly safe in the middle of the board. A second example is supplied by my analysis of a variation of the Slav De- fence.

5...Wxdl+ 6 &xdl! (D)
White could have retained his right to castle by playing 6 £}xdl ; however, it is better to use the king since castling is no longer necessary in this position, and it On castling and attacking the castled position in general 59 is more important that the knight should remain on c3. For example, after 6 £jxdl b5 7 a4 Black is not obliged to continue with ...b4, whereas after 6 xdl b5 7 a4 he has nothing better than 7...b4, whereupon White obtains the advantage by 8 Nbl Ba6 9 3d2. In this instance White, in playing xdl , does not gain the 'centralizing tempo' which he did on the thirteenth move in the previous example, but he prefers to lose his chance to castle just to keep his knight on c3. Many occasions for renouncing castling in this way arise in practice, but one should avoid taking the king too far afield. This comment applies to so-called 'queenless middlegames' and not to true endgames, in which the king is nearly always better placed in the centre. One should keep one's eyes open and weigh up the opponent's opportunities for an attack on one's king, for they can easily develop in 'queenless middlegames'. Safety from attack and a genuine prospect of making further piece exchanges - these are the two important criteria affecting a decision on the forfeiture of the right to castle. The cases I have mentioned in which castling can be justifiably postponed or dispensed with are meant to induce the reader to think about the problem more deeply, for every rule in chess should be applied flexibly. To make a correct deci- sion on exactly when to castle one needs considerable knowledge and experi- ence. Finally, one more hint: even in cases where there is justification for a delay in castling, it is still a good thing to have the opportunity to castle quickly on one side at least. When the pieces have been moved out on one side of the back rank, we have an opportunity to castle 'at hand', and this castling will cost just one tempo. However, if there is one piece which has still not left the back rank then obviously castling will cost us two tempi. Now there is a big difference between one tempo and two, if one's opponent can discover some concealed means for a sudden attack on the king before it has reached its castled residence! For this rea- son it is good policy to get ready to castle as soon as possible, and then consider whether it can still be put off for a while. The basic elements of the attack on the castled king The attack on the castled king is a particular type of mating attack, but in practice it is the most important, since castling takes place in the majority of games. In considering an attack of this kind, we must begin with a general survey of the action involved, acquainting ourselves, on the one hand, with the basic char- acteristics of the actual castled position itself and, on the other, with the good and bad aspects of an attack on that position.
60 The Art of Attack in Chess
The castled position consists of the castled king and the protective pawns and also to a certain extent the pieces which are in the vicinity or in some other way connected with the formation. This structure should be regarded as a positional formation, i.e. a group of pieces having one or more fairly permanent features. One could also go further and say that castled positions are, as a rule, passive rather than active positional formations, i.e. their more permanent feature stems ultimately from a certain im- mobility of the pieces, and not in their mobility, as is the case when the pieces are in strong positions. (This is, of course, the general rule, but in practice the castled position may also contain a piece in a strong position, for example a fianchettoed bishop.) The passive nature of the castled position results from the lack of mobility of the king, and this is indirectly transferred to the other pieces in the position as well; the first to be affected are the pawns, which 'may not be moved, if the cas- tled position is not to be weakened', and which are as a result made indirectly im- mobile. If they in fact move from their initial squares and so create weaknesses in the castled position, these weaknesses result from the reduced options entailed by the advance. (A pawn at h2 controls the square g3 and also has it in its power, by advancing, to govern g4, g5, g6, etc. If it moves to h3, then, out of its total number of actual or potential areas of control, it loses that over g3, and so loses part of its active potential.) Even the pieces associated with the castled position are affected to a certain extent by the general immobility of the formation, whether functionally because of the need for a certain square to be defended or spatially because of the difficulty involved in their centralization. The structure and the degree of weakness of the opponent's castled position also influence the way in which the attacker employs his pieces in a mating at- tack. The variety here is extremely wide, ranging from lightning assaults to purely positional manoeuvres and from uncompromising charges to cautious preparations, in which the player really only flirts with an attack on the king in order to restrict his opponent's options. More will be said on these and similar points later on. However, the basic weaknesses of the castled position which I have described also contain one positive feature which becomes apparent when an attempt is made to exploit them. This positive feature derives from the fact that the castled position is always a decentralized one, so that as a rule any attack on it demands a greater or lesser decentralization of the attacker's pieces. This factor is particu- larly important in that the main positional rule for normal play is that pieces should be centralized. There is, then, a basic contradiction between consistent centralization and an attack on the castled king, and it is here that the principal On castling and attacking the castled position in general 61 risk of such an attack lies. If the attack does not succeed, the fact that some of the attacker's pieces are out of position as a rule tells against the attacker. The reader will come to understand the deeper significance of this argument in the final chapters of this book. To understand the attack on the castled king we shall start with the basic fac- tors involved, spatial, material and temporal (the method I applied in my Intro- duction to Chess and School of Combinations). It is true that in every action which takes place on the chessboard all these three factors can be observed to- gether, since each move has its own spatial, material and temporal significance; however, the emphasis of one's actual observation may be in one case on the spa- tial, in another on the material, and in a third on the temporal, aspect. For this rea- son, the separation of the different factors is the most effective and the clearest method for teaching purposes. The attack on the castled king in the past At the time when modern chess was in its infancy, i.e. after the reforms of the rules in the last quarter of the fifteenth century, the attack on the castled king did not yet exist, or at any rate there was no trace of it in the games recorded. The cas- tling move itself was at that time only in the process of being created (some were still using the mediaeval king's jump, while others were castling but in two moves - i.e. first Ehl-fl, and then on the next move &el-gl, etc.) and combina- tive technique - especially with the 'new pieces', the queen and the knight - was still fairly primitive, so that the decision in a game was usually reached by cruder methods than by attacking the castled king, e.g. by capturing on f7 before cas- tling had taken place or simply by winning material. The first recorded instance of an attack on the castled king occurs in the so-called Paris MS., which origi- nated about 1500, a more mature and fuller development of Lucena's work of 1497, the oldest printed book on modern chess. In the course of analysing an opening (one later given the name of Philidor Defence) the author arrives at the position at the top of the following page: Black, to move, plays: l...g5! 2 Nh2 h5 He uses his pawns to carry out an attack on the king, a plan suited to this posi- tion as it takes advantage of White's weakness on h3. 3f3? A mistake, which Lucena makes 'in accordance with the thought of his times' . White could have defended himself satisfactorily if he had immediately played 3 b5!.
62 The Art of Attack in Chess
3... h6 4 b5 Sg8 5 B>2?
A further mistake. White should at once have played 5 bxc6 Nxc6 6 d5 Rd7
7 Xa3, when Black, pinned down at c6 and g8, would have had to refrain from
going straight ahead with ...g4 and consolidate his position first.
5...g4 6 fxg4 hxg4 7 xg4?
Poor defensive technique! After 7 hl Black would have had a difficult task, for 7...gxh3 would not do any good because of 8 Rh5+ followed by Rxh3.
7...Nxg4 8 hxg4 Sxg4 9 bxc6 xc6 10 Nd5 Bd8 (D)
11 c4? White could have put up more resistance by 11 Sa3. No real advantage would come of 11 Rc4 because of 11 ... ?d7. Naturally, 1 1 c4? is very weak and quite inappropriate, since it does nothing to help the defence and only obstructs the di- agonal for the white queen. ll...Sa7 12 Sf2 Sh7 13 Wdl? Rh6?! On castling and attacking the castled position in general 63 Black's technique is poor too. After 13...Sgh4 14 Sfl wg6!, White would be caught in a mating net.
14 Nfl Rh5 15 Rf3 g6 16 Rd3 Shl+?
The manuscript follows on from here with 17 Ne2 Sxal 18 JLxal Sxg2 and concludes: 'Black has the better prospects'. To all appearances the author was mainly concerned with the win of a pawn, forgetting that the primary aim of an attack on the castled king is mate! By 16...Sg3 17 Rc2 Rg4 18 &el Ba5+ the matter could have been brought to an end considerably more quickly. The advance in technique in attacking the castled king was extremely slow throughout the sixteenth century, and it was only at the beginning of the seven- teenth that Greco in his manual indicated some combinations which, though new then, now strike modern minds as nothing more than elementary tricks. As an ex- ample of the technical level reached by Greco, let us look at a continuation from his book.
1 e4 e5 2 Nf3 Nc6 3 Nc4 Nc5 4 O-O 2tf6 5 Sei O-O 6 c3 Re7?
Greco had not yet realized the importance of keeping control of the centre and gives Black this weak move instead of the correct 6...d6.
7 d4 exd4 8 e5!
This is even stronger than 8 cxd4'.
8...<Ng4 (D)
1 As we shall see, this comment is incorrect. After 8 cxd4 White has a clear ad-
vantage, since Black has no compensation for White's central control. The move 8 e5 is a mistake which gives Black at least equality.
64 The Art of Attack in Chess
9 cxd4? Weakly played. By 9 Bg5 (an intermediate move!) 9... e8 10 cxd4 White would have obtained a winning position. (Greco and other authors right up to the middle of the nineteenth century did not see the intermediate move 9 J&g5, so that 8 e5 came to be regarded in the textbooks as a mistake! )
9...£jxd4! 10 Nxd4 Rh4
This is Greco's trick. White has two exposed spots, at h2 and f2. Ili.e3 Greco naturally also gives the continuation 11 Nf3 Rxf2+ followed by
12...Wgl+ and a smothered mate by the knight at f2.
Il..>xh2+ 12 &fl Whl+?! In carrying his attack further Greco does not notice all the finesses. 12...Nxe3+ * followed by .. .d6 would have been better here2.
13 Ne2 Rxg2 14 Sgl Bxe3 15 Nxe3?
This way White loses two valuable pawns, and Greco concludes his analysis with 15...Nxd4+ 16 Nxd4 Rxf2+ 17 Nc3 Re3+ 18 Nd3 xe5+, with advan- tage to Black. Instead of 15 Nxe3?, the correct continuation is 15 Sxg2 <5)xdl 16 Nf5, when Black must find the reply 16...d5! 17 Bxg7 Bh3!, if he is to retain the better pros- pects (though even here there is still some uncertainty after 18 Sg3 .xf2 19 Exh3 dxc4 20 d2, etc.). If he played 16... xb2 17 2)h6+ <Nh8 18 Nxf7+, he would have to consent to a draw, since 18...Sxf7 is probably not a good idea3. In step with the general advance in chess skill there can also be seen an ad- vance in the technique of attacking the castled king, first with Philidor and then, particularly, with Morphy. The romantic reaction which followed led to the Black should meet 9 Ag5 by 9...dxc3!. After 10 Bxe7 Jlxf2+ 11 S ?f1 cxb2 12 £}c3 (12 Na3 ixel also favours Black) 12...JLxel (12...bxalW 13 xal -&xel 14 £}d5 is unclear) 13 #ki5 xe7 14 £}xe7+ 'i'hS Black has a clear advantage in view of the threats of 15...bxal and 15...Ne3+. White's strongest move is 9 b4!" but an analysis of the resulting complications (which lead to a roughly equal position) would take us too far afield. Perhaps those old analysts knew a thing or two after all!
2 A baffling comment, as after 12... xe3+ 13 fxe3 d6 14 #}f3 White starts to con-
3 solidate his extra material. Greco's continuation appears best to me. After 18...fixf7 19 .xf7 b6!, followed by ...jLa6+ and developing the rook, Black is virtually winning - three pawns for the exchange and a pair of active bishops is surely too much. On castling and attacking the castled position in general 65 development of a number of particular types of sacrificial attacks, but without in general reaching Morphy's level. Steinitz was concerned with perfecting defen- sive technique, and his influence on the style of the period was slowly beginning to make the attack on the castled king fade from master chess. Lasker, too, the new World Champion, was even in his youth already turning away from forcing such attacks, preferring to aim at perfection in the endgame. At the end of the century, however, there were three great masters who defended the thesis of at- tacking chess and who in doing so clearly showed themselves to be supporters of the attack on the castled king. These were Chigorin, Tarrasch and Pillsbury, each of whom in his own way helped to enrich the technique of attack. Chigorin illus- trated particularly the power of the positional sacrifice in his games; Tarrasch's thesis was that the rapid development of the pieces and a strong centre were the basic requisites for an attack on the castled king; while Pillsbury created a kind of synthesis of the attacking style and the positional and endgame play of Steinitz and Lasker. In other words, the American grandmaster showed how a rapid switch can be made from attack to a simplification which gives the better ending. In this way all the basic elements of a perfected technique for attacking the cas- tled king were set out, and after a short period of stagnation in the first two de- cades of the present century there followed the real blossoming of the dynamic style with the arrival of Capablanca and Alekhine. This development is still rele- vant to the theme of the attack on the castled king today, and more will be said about it at the end of the book.
4 Mating patterns
Spatial relationships in a mating attack can be observed by examining mating patterns, focal-points, and the roles played by the ranks, files, and diagonals. In this chapter we shall be concerned with mating patterns. This choice has a practi- cal justification in that mating patterns can be more easily remembered than the ways leading up to mate. For this reason mating patterns, even though they occur only at the very end of a mating attack, are fundamental for practical purposes because of the excellent mnemonic assistance which they provide to the player. Our first concern is for the most common mating patterns; these hardly ever occur in the middle of the board, but they are very frequent in the castling area, i.e. near the king's position on the edge of the board. Typical mates without enemy pieces There are a very large number of typical mates of this kind and most of them are elementary, so we shall consider only a few examples. (For the sake of greater clarity the diagrams are shown without the white king.) In the first position White, to move, has a choice between two typical mates: 1) 1 Ng6+ Ng8 2 Rh7+ <Nf8 3 Rf7#. 2) 1 ±f5+ Ng8 2 Be6#. Mating patterns 67 In this position there are again two possible mates, depending on how Black replies. If 1 Nh8, then 2 Sh7# (the so-called Arab mate, because it is recorded in Arabic manuscripts of the ninth century). If 1 £jf6+ *Nf8, then there follows 2 Sf7#, a mating pattern which is worth remembering.
B
Another mate which should be known is this one with two knights, but if there are no other pieces on the board then it cannot be forced. Typical mates with enemy pieces
B
The so-called back-row mate by the rook (or queen) is one of the most typical mating patterns.
B
Of the fairly large number of typical mates with queen and pawn this one is given first. Black is to move; he cannot escape mate, since he is threatened by 1 Rh6 and 2 g7#. If he plays l...( 'h7, then 2 Fh4+ and 3 Rh6, etc. If Black had a pawn on h7 he would have the defence l... h8 2 Rh6 Sg8.
68 The Art of Attack in Chess
W
Damiano's Mate This is a position from the book (1512) by Damiano, a Portuguese apothecary, one of the first authors in the literature of European chess. White mates in five moves.
1 Sh8+ Nxh8 2 Hhl+ Ng8 3 Sh8+ 3?xh8 4 Whl+ Ng8 5 Rh7#.
The rook sacrifices were naturally introduced to make the essential point clear: the queen must reach the h-file with gain of tempo. The pattern of Damiano's mate can be seen more clearly in the following ex- amples.
1 Rh5 Ne7 2 fh7+ 8 3 Rh8#.
In this case a bishop has been placed on f8 and also a pawn on d6, with the re- sult that the bishop can only move to e7, where it blocks the king's escape. The general theme of Damiano's mate, the pattern of which is characterized by a black pawn on g7 and a white pawn or bishop on g6, can be subjected to numer- ous variations. The following diagram serves as a memory aid for mates with queen and rook: Black, to move, cannot avoid mate; if he plays 1..J±>g7, then 2 Rh6+ and 3 Rh7# Mating patterns 69 or 3 Rh8#, while if l...f6, then 2 Rh7#. If Black has another pawn on g7 he can save himself from immediate mate by 1...f6, while if he has one on g6 he can ex- tricate himself by l... g7.
B
Of the mates with queen and bishop this position is worth remembering. Black cannot save himself from mate, but if he plays 1.. .g6, White does not re- ply 2 Bxg6+ (which is answered by 2... g7, and Black's king slips away) but 2 Rh6, in which case there is no remedy against mate. Smothered Mate The smothered mate with queen and knight is a celebrated one: 1 £}f7+ <Ng8 2 Nh6+ Nh8 (or 2 3 W7#) 3 Rg8+! Sxg8 (or 3...Nxg8) 4 2Bf7#.
70 The Art of Attack in Chess
This position falls into category of typical mates, and it is useful to know the mating patterns which arise if Black tries to parry the threat of Rh7#, e.g. with l...fib8. If there is a black pawn on e7 or if the square is otherwise occupied by Black, then there follows 2 Rh7+ Nf8 3 Rh8#; if this is not so, mate can be achieved, for example, by 2 Rxf7+ Nh8 3 Sg8 4 Rh5#. Of the various attacking positions with queen and knight this scheme is also well worth remembering. On 1 Nf6+, Black replies l...Nh8 and if 2 Nh5+, then
2...f6.
If l...Ng7, White has a double check with 2 £te8+ (in some cases, depending on the arrangement of the other pieces, 2 Nh5+ may be stronger) and after
2.. . h6 3 4+ g5 4 Vfrf6+ *N115 5 Ng7+ White only needs a pawn on g2 or h2 to
force mate. Greco fs Mate This position is also worth knowing; Black is forced he is mated by 2 Nxf7+ <Nh8 3 g6! hxg5 4 Rh5#. to play l...h6, after which Mating patterns 71 In the case of mating patterns with rook and bishop one should first of all get to know the above position. It is Black's move and he must try to parry Sg5#; this cannot be achieved by 1 ...h6, because of 2 Sxh6, which leaves him with no way out. So l...Nc8 2 fig5+ Nf8 3 Sg7!, and now too mate is unavoidable, for Black is unable to free the square d7 in time to provide the king with an escape square. If he did not have, for instance, the pawn on c6, he could play 3...jLc6 4 Sxh7 e8 and then 5 2h8+ could be met by 5... d7. One could replace Black's bishop and c6-pawn by a white pawn on c6 and a black one on c7; mate would still be unavoidable .

'Blind swine' If it is White's move, he mates with 1 Sg7+, 2 Bh7+, and 3 fibg7#. If Black is to move and plays l.."Sfd8, White can neither force mate or even win. That is to say, after 2 fig7+ *h8 3 Hh7+ <4>g8 4 Sbg7+ <±>f8 5 5b7, Black simply plays
5...Ng8, 'questioning* the white rook and countering the threat of mate. (It de-
pends of course on the distribution of the other pieces whether White can in fact win. In this position he can easily mate if he has a pawn on h4, for he plays 6 h5 followed by 7 h6, 8 Hbg7+, and 9 Sh8# ~ a mate which is worth remembering. In this line Black's pawn on f6 is actually a help to White. If it were not there, Black could get a draw after 6 h5 by playing 6...Sa6!.)
74 The Art of Attack in Chess
The pair of rooks which 'grunt out check' on the seventh rank but cannot get a sight of mate were once nicknamed 'blind swine'by Janowski. An acquaintance with typical mating patterns is extremely useful when mak- ing a quick survey of the board in an actual game. The addition of further mate- rial to the position can be especially useful, for then one can see which changes help to prevent mate and which enrich the mating patterns in new situations. Less usual mating patterns Of the large number of less usual, and even exotic, mating patterns, I have chosen ones which bear some nickname or which can easily be given one.

Boden's Mate This position is from the game Schulder-Boden, London 1853 , in which the following mate with two bishops was recorded for the first time; it is not uncom- mon after castling queenside. Black plays: l...Rxc3+! 2 bxc3 Ba3#. Pillsbury's Mate
1 Sxg7+ <Nh8 2 Sg8+! Nxg8 3 Sgl+ and mate.
This is really a variation on Morphy's mate, contrived in such a way that it is the rook which mates and not the bishop, which is under attack from Black's rook.
1 In the original book this example was incorrectly given as Macdonell-Boden,
1869 and Black's rook on e8 was missing. Mating patterns 77 Legall's Mate Legall was Philidor's teacher and this position arose in the game Legall-St Brie, Paris 1750. The moves leading up to the diagram were 1 e4 e5 2 Nf3 d6 3 Jlc4 Bg4 4 Nc3 g6? and Legall now played: 5 Nxe5! .xdl? (5... .e6 would have been better) 6 Bxf7+ e7 7 Nd5#. (This is of course a case of an attack be- fore castling, but the example is given here for purely practical reasons.) The next mate is similar to Greco's, but differs in that the attacker (here Black) opens the h-file not only for his opponent but also for himself.

Blackburne's Mate Mating patterns 79 For this mate the attacker needs three minor pieces (two bishops and a knight) and usually a queen as well, which is sacrificed. 1 hl h5 2 Rxh5! gxh5 3 ±h7#. This mating pattern is named after Black- burne, who was the first to mate in this way.
5 Focal-points
The series of examples examined in the chapter on mating patterns has given us a good idea of the difficulties a defender encounters when his forces (especially the pawns in front of his castled king) are poorly placed and when the attacker's one aim is to fill the various 'holes and cracks' in the weakened enemy defences with his own pieces and thus obtain an even tighter grip. It follows from this that the squares in the immediate vicinity of the king, where the drama of the mating attack usually reaches its climax, play a special role. If the attacker threatens mate or actually mates on these squares, they are mating focal-points, but if he only harries the king from them or uses them as points from which to break into the castled position, they are called strategic or auxiliary focal-points. It may be that there is more than one mating focal-point, and in that case we speak of com- pound focal-points. If there are many focal-points (both mating and strategic) on squares of the same colour, we speak of a network of weak squares. Generally speaking, every focal-point is a weak square in the defender's terri- tory and a potentially strong one for the attacker. In addition to the focal-points there are also other squares in the castling area which have a specific function, e.g. blocked squares, particularly those occupied by the defender's pawns, and also any weak squares on which the attacker can safely post his pieces. As an illustration of this, take the following position (which we have already seen earlier). Here we have the following scheme: Focal-points 81 • mating squares: g8 and f8; • mating focal-points: h7 and h8; • auxiliary focal-point: h7 (after Black parries mate by ...Be7) • attacker's strong squares: f7, g6 and h7; • blocked squares: g7 and later e7. The focal-point at g7 As usual, when referring to specific squares we assume that White is the attacker. It is understood that if Black is the attacker, then the discussion applies equally to the square g2. The most important focal-points where castling kingside is concerned are g7 and h7, since these squares are more accessible to the attacker than the others in the castling area. Of the two, h7 is the more frequent object of attack (since it co- mes under fire from the bishop operating from d3, a natural point of develop- ment, while the king's knight can reach g5, for example, more easily than f5 or h5). However, attacks against g7 are the more dangerous. The reasons for this are very simple: the queen can mate more easily from g7 than h7 (owing to the king's ability to flee to f8), but as well as this, a weakness on g7 usually brings with it two more on f6 and h6, while one on h7 generally only entails a single ex- tra one at g6. Every player of any experience is well acquainted with this fact and knows that ...g6 involves a greater weakening than ...h6. On the other hand, h7 is usually harder to defend than g7, which the king's bishop can support in two ways (from f8 or f6). The next position illustrates a typical example of an action against the square g7:
82 The Art of Attack in Chess
White, to play, has excellent prospects for an attack on g7. His knight is al- ready observing the square, while his queen and bishop are in a position to threaten it in one move. An extremely useful point is the fact that the queen has the choice of attacking from either c3 or g3. Nevertheless, the situation is not quite as simple as that, and White must be prepared to sacrifice his bishop on h6 if he is to obtain a winning position; by simply playing 1 Rg3, White would only gain a relatively small advantage, e.g. I...g6 2 Bg5 Rc5 3 W6+ Bxf6 4 Bxf6, when Black can counter with 4...h6 followed by ..&hT Only 1 Bh6! guarantees complete success; the main reason why it is better to move the bishop rather than the queen is that in order to attack g7 the bishop has only the one move to h6, whereas the queen has a choice between c3 and g3. Thus the bishop enters the fray first, while the queen waits to see which will be better, depending on Black's reply. Thus: If 1...gxh6, then 2 Rc3 f6 (if 2...Nf8, then 3 W'6+ leads to a quick conclusion) 3 g3+ Bg4 (otherwise the queen mates on g7) 4 Rxg4+ f7 5 g7+ <Ne6 6 £}f4+ d7 7 £k!5 followed by 8 Nxf6+. In this variation the queen is most effec- tive if it goes first to c3 and then to g3. If 1...Bf8, then White plays 2 .xg7 .xg7 3 Rg3 as
4 Rxg7+ e7 5 Rg5+
2 Rc3 f6 3 Nxf6+ and White wins, for after 3...Bxf6 4 Rxf6 Black has no de-
fence against mate on g7. In order not to be unfair to Black, who tends to suffer in books such as this, here are some actual cases where White came to grief on the analogous square - g2. Focal-points 83 This position arose in the game Coria-Capablanca, Buenos Aires 1914. Black, to move, attacks g2: White played this in desperation; if 3 Nxg2 Rg5 4 f3, Black plays 4...£}h3+ and wins White's queen - a typical trick in positions such as this.
3...Nxe4 4 Ng3 £413#.
This position is taken from Field-Tenner, New York 1933. It is Black's move. I...Nf4 2 xe41 Rh3! 0-1 The attack on g2, with its threat of mate, is carried on regardless. White re- signed since he sees that 3 gxh3 is followed by 3... xh3#. The following position arose in the game Boleslavsky-Ufimtsev, Semi-finals USSR Championship, Omsk 1944. The Soviet master and geologist Ufimtsev, playing Black, overcame his great opponent as follows:
1...£te4! 2 Ra5
After 2 Bxb6 4bxd2 White cannot play 3 Nxd2 because of the attack on g2, so he would lose either his bishop on b6 or his knight on f3.

25 Bf5+ Nh8 26 Rxg6! 1-0
Since 26...hxg6 is answered by 27 Sh3+ and mate. A pointed end to a game which contained some typical manoeuvres in the struggle by the queen and knight for the focal-point g7. Further examples of play against the focal-point g7 are contained in the chap- ter on fianchettoed positions. The focal-point h7 While the attacker cannot easily target g7, the square h7 is often exposed to dan- ger even in the opening stages of a game, although attacks based on h7 as a fo- cal-point are generally not so dangerous as those aimed at g7. This important point has already been noted, together with the reason for it, i.e. the fact that the 1 24 xb7, winning a piece, is even more convincing. Focal-points 89 king can escape from g8 to f8, whereas to avoid the threat of the queen on g7 the king has to travel further (to e8 or e7). Because of this, the main task involved in attacks on the focal-point g7 is the 'clearing' of that square, while the possible escape of the king is a minor worry. In attacks on h7 the 'clearing' is usually the easier task, while the attacker's main preoccupation is to stop the king escaping; this means essentially that he should have a new focal-point in view, if the attack is to be successful. In other words, the possible escape of the king turns the pri- mary focal-point h7 into a secondary one, so that a new, real focal-point becomes necessary. It is worth keeping this important fact in mind, since in practice the majority of possible attacks on h7 founder precisely on the king's use of the sim- ple defensive expedient of running away. These factors, which apply to most attacks on h7, are well illustrated by the following example. White, to move, begins with 1 Wbl!. Black's queen has to guard the square e8, and so has only two replies: 1) l...Rd7 2 Se7! (after 2 Sxe8+? Rxe8 3 Rh7+ Nf8 White's attack comes to a dead end, since the black king has e7 to escape to) 2...Rxe7 (2...Sxe7 has the same effect, while if 2...Rd8, then 3 Rh7+ followed by 4 2xf7#) 3 Rh7+ <Nf8 4 Rh8#. 2) l...Rc6 2 d5 Rc8 3 £Lxe8+ (this is all right now, but 3 He7? would not do because of 3...jtxg5) 3...Rxe8 4 Rh7+ f8 5 d6, and Black cannot avoid mate next move by 6 Rh8#. White's combination, then, has two variations, and the point of each is to de- prive Black's king of an escape to e7, either by blocking it or playing d6. The square h7 appears here as a secondary focal-point, while the crucial factor in the combination is the mate when the king reaches f8.
90 The Art of Attack in Chess
There is in fact such an abundance of attacks against the castled king with a real or secondary focal-point at h7, and they differ so widely, that an attempt to systematize them would take us too far afield; let us be content with a few general examples, and then deal in more detail with 'the classic bishop sacrifice on h7', which in practice is the most important kind of attack on the focal-point h7.
W
This position arose in Szabo- Kotov, Groningen 1946. It is White's move, and he effects the 'clearing' of the focal-point h7 by eliminating the knight on f6: 1 2kd5! exd5 2 Nxf6 £Af5 The only reply, though an inadequate one.
3 Rxf5 g6
White now continued with 4 Rxg6+ fxg6 5 Bxd5+ Sf7 6 kxel and won on the basis of his material advantage, but 4 Bxe7 gxf5 5 Bxf8 would have been even clearer. Focal-points 91 Here we have a straightforward example of the creation of a mating position by directing the queen and a pawn against the focal-point h7, followed by a typi- cal new mate after the black king has escaped.
1 Nxh7+ <Nxh7 2 Rh5+ <4?g8 3 g6 Ze8 4 Rh7+ <Nf8 5 h8+ <Ne7 6 Rxg7#.

In this position Black aims to drive White's rook from f4 and then proceed with ...g3, creating a threat against h2. He plays:
2 Nxe5
If 2 d4 Bxf4 3 Bxf4, Black continues 3...g3 4 Rf3 Rh2+ 5 &fl hl+ 6 Ne2 Nf6 7 xg3 Bg4+ 8 Ne3 Wcl+ 9 Nd3 Wfl+ 10 ?c2 Rxc4 and wins. If 2 W3 Nxf4 3 Rxf4 Wel+ 4 Nh2 (both 4 Afl Sh7 and 4 #fl Wxfi+ 5 xfl Sh7 are in Black's favour) 4...Nf6! 5 Nxh8, Black wins by 5...g3+6 Rxg3 Ng4+.
2...dxe5 3 Sf7
If 3 Sfl, Black plays 3. ..O-O-O and then ...g3, forcing mate. At once 3...g3 would not be good because of 4 Jlf7+ and 5 h5.
3...g3
This move is now playable; indeed, it is obligatory, since after 3...O-O-O 4 d3 g3 Black is a tempo behind with his attack; White then has the following defence, a characteristic one in such positions: 5 Qh2+ 6 &fl Whl+ 7 JLgl, and Black's attack has come to nothing.
4 Rf3 .g4! (D)
A typical method of preparing the mating net; one should not check if this only simplifies the opponent's defence. It should be noted that checking at h2 and then hl loses a tempo. Black's aim is to oblige the white king to move to fl of its own free will, and then give check with the queen directly at hl , without stopping at h2.

Admittedly, he controls the square h7, but, at the same time, he cannot prevent the black king from escaping via f7 when it is checked. If the game is continued correctly, White can only obtain perpetual check, not mate. Both 17

This is relatively the best way out for White. 19 fie6 .xe6 20 Rh7+ Nf8 21 dxe6 d5 is inadequate for White, and he loses.

Never- theless, Black can then win by 20...Nf8 21 Rh5+ g6, etc. This simple continua- tion was, strangely enough, not noticed by Keres's 'correspondence customers', and Euwe also fails to record it in his opening works, giving instead a draw by 2O... .xe6? 21 dxe6+ Sxe6 22 Bxe6+ ixeb 23 xg6+ Rf6 24 Se3+, etc.

The reader will find further examples concerning the focal-point h7 in the next chapter, which deals with the classic bishop sacrifice. These examples provide a typical illustration of the part played by the square h7 as a mating and secondary focal-point. The auxiliary focal-point f7 Mention has already been made of the vulnerability of the square f7 before cas- tling, and now we shall examine the part played by an assault on that square after

the king has castled. First of all, it should be remarked that the square f7 is only in exceptional cases the focal-point in the true sense, i.e. the square from which mate is effected. However, it is very often an auxiliary focal-point, which is at- tacked either in order to drive the king away from g8 or, by means of a sacrifice, to draw the king on to the actual square itself. The following position from the game Tylor-Koltanowski, Hastings 1930 arose after the moves 1 d4 CT6 2 3f3 d6 3 c3 £}bd7 4 e4 e5 5 Bc4 $Le7 6 O-O a O-O 7 e2 exd4 8 <Nxd4 Ee8 (D).

Black therefore played 13...Nd5, but after 14 dxe7 Sxe7 15 Nd5 his position was hopeless. The following position from the game Burn-E. Cohn, Breslau 1912 illustrates a faulty attack on f7. It was White's move and he played:

Focal-points 99 This position occurred in the game Najdorf-Ivkov from the last round of the tournament at Mar del Plata 1955.

Focal-points 101 Complex focal-points Just as a successful combination derives essentially from the multiple effects of single moves, so attacks on the castled king are also more likely to succeed if they are built up with the assistance of threats against a number of different squares. We shall find that in many attacks of this kind the attacker tries to comer the king by creating a second or even a third focal-point. There have already been cases of such complex focal-points in previous examples, but we shall now ex- amine the matter more closely. We have already mentioned the part played by secondary focal-points and by the combination of this kind of focal-point with a real one. However, here we will examine only the combining of two or more real focal-points, i.e. squares from which a player either actually mates or could do so in a variation. These real com- plex focal-points can be divided up as follows: 1 ) The focal-points are adjacent squares of different colours (e.g. g7 and h7). 2) The focal-points are nearby squares of the same colour (e.g. h7 and f7). 3) The focal-points are of the same colour and make up a whole complex or network of squares (e.g. f6, g7 and h8). In general, one or more of the attacker's pieces control both focal-points, while the rest, in the course of the attack, transfer their influence from one focal- point to the other, preferably in the shortest time possible (i.e. one move). As far as simultaneous influence over two squares of different colours is concerned, for practical purposes only the queen comes into consideration, and in exceptional cases the rook; but if the focal -points are of the same colour, both the knight and, in particular, the bishop are effective. All the pieces are capable of transferring the attack from one focal-point to the other, though the bishop is unable to do this if the focal-points are of different colours. The bishop is, however, well suited to the case of focal-points of the same colour, while when the focal-points belong to the third group, it is indeed the classic piece by which the whole network is domi- nated. When play is based on focal-points of different colours, the attack may be switched rapidly from one of the squares to the other. However, the commoner and more important cases are those in which there are two separate stages, the at- tack on the first focal-point being exhausted before the player transfers it deci- sively to the second. This transfer is often combined with a transformation of the mating pattern. An example of this is given in the following diagram (D). White, to move, begins with a sharp threat against the focal-point g7.

In order to be able to meet 2 Rh6 by 2...2g8. l...Rc6 is weaker because of 2 Ef3 and Black has only made his position worse.
2 Ih6 Sg8
White can clearly go no further in his threats against g7, but a new opportunity now offers itself - a rapid preparation for mate on h7, for which the queen is al- ready excellently placed; all that is needed is to bring a rook on to the h-file.
3 Ef3! Nxf3
Forced, since there was a threat not only of 4 Hh3 (against which, for example, 1 3... c6 would have helped2) but also of 4 Rxh7+ and 5 Sh3#. 4 gxf3 d5 The new threat of a queen sacrifice followed by Hh2# wipes out Black's de- fence. White does not play 5 Sh2 now, in which case Black would give up his queen for the rook, but 5 f4, when Black can only stave off mate for a move or two by sacrificing his queen at f4. In the following diagram we have an instructive example of play using focal- points of different colours. The threat against the focal-point h7 is replaced by one against g7. Then comes the decisive moment in the main variation - a sudden simultaneous attack on h7 and g7. In one sub- variation there even appears a third focal-point at f7.
1 Hhl g8!
By l...Bxg3+ 2 Ne2 Black would only make the defence more difficult for himself. In playing l... g8! he attempts to defend by running with his king, i.e. he surrenders h7 to White and hopes for the continuation 2 xh7+? f8 3 hS-F 1 2 Rh6 forces immediate mate.

Focal-points 103 Ne7, which leads to a complete consolidation of the black king's position; the ta- bles are then turned and Black threatens ...Ec3 followed by play on the queenside against the weak spots in White's camp. Therefore, White does not capture on h7, but hits on a manoeuvre to open up the d3-h7 diagonal by the lethal f6. 2Hh5! The passive 2 Eh3 would be weak, while 2 Eh4? is clearly no good because of
2...jlxg3+ and 3..Bxh4.

2...Rd6, but that allows 3 Rxh7+, 4 Rh8+, and 5 1 xc8, when White is a rook
up. After 2....Nxg3+ 3 Ne2 Black can do nothing in the face of Eg5+ and f6. However, he discovers a subtle defence, which is typical for such positions.
2...Rc7 (D)
104 The Art of Attack in Chess
This protects the third focal-point at f7, which is important as the final mating square in the combination beginning with 3 Sg5+; thus after 3...fxg5 4 f6 -Nxf6 5 Bxh7+ there is no mate. But White still has one trump card left. 3b6! Attacking Black's queen, which is overloaded with duties at the key square c7: it is obliged to guard the rook (against the possibility of Rxh7+ and Rh8+) and also watch the square f7. Black therefore played:
3..>d7
If 3... .xg3+, White would in this case have to play 4 si?f3'1. 4fih4 A simple move and one which shows that Black's queen has yet another func- tion - to maintain control of the b8-h2 diagonal. There is now an irresistible threat of fig4+; 4...Bxg3+ 5 <4?xg31Bfd6+ 6 <£ 3 Rf8 is useless due to 7 Rxh7#. An excellent example of the shift of threats from one focal-point to another, and at the same time a lesson in the troubles facing a piece which is overburdened with different functions. In this position, from Szabo- van Scheltinga, Hil versum 1947, White won in interesting fashion. 1 2>g5 g6 2 d5 White's first move, with its attack on h7, forced a weakening on the long diag- onal, and his subsequent manoeuvres aim to bring the queen to that diagonal. Black should try 3...Well, creating serious counter-threats and preventing 4 Hg5+ fxg5 5 f6 because of 5...IIc2+ 6 Bxc2 Rxc2+, followed by 7...Rg6. White should continue 4 fih4 Sc2+ 5 jLxc2 Rxc2+ 6 d?gl Rxf5 7 Rh5 with a large advantage, but of course there is no mate. Focal-points 105

After 10...Rxe5 the attack returns to the original focal-point at h7 in the shape of 11 Sxh7#. This position arose in the game V. Vukovic-Endzelins from the match between Yugoslavia and Latvia at the 1936 Munich Olympiad. White first obtained free- dom of action for himself by blocking the long light diagonal. 1 d5! exd5 If l... Bxd5, then 2 Rg5 g6 3 Jlxg6, etc.
2 Qtel 3 Nxg7! Nxg7 4 Rg5+ Nh8 5 Rh4+
White checks from h4 rather than h6 to give Black the chance to make a mis- take. Endzelins did in fact fall for it and played 5...<Ng7?; this was followed by 6 £}d4, and Black lost his queen, since Nf5+ leads to a terrible catastrophe on the focal-point g7. The rest of the actual game is of no interest (it finished 6...Sg8 7 Rg5+ *3?f8 8 Nxe6+ <Ne7 9 Bg7 Sxg7 10 Hifxg7 Sg8 11 £el+ 1-0), but what does interest is an analysis of Black's more tenacious reply 5...Ng8 (D). Rellstab in his book of the tournament states that White would then have to satisfy himself with perpetual check, but this is not correct. Admittedly, after 6 £jd4 Sxcl! 7 fixcl Re5 8 £}f5 Black has the reply 8... e4!, an interesting ex- ample of a move with a double defensive purpose with reference to the focal- points h7 and g7, around which White's attack revolves. Further attempts, e.g. by
9 Rg4+ Nh8 10 f3, are dangerous for White because of 10...Bc8!, while other
short-cuts also have obstacles in their way. It was, however, White's intention to
106 The Art of Attack in Chess
take the rook with his queen, and this would in fact have won the game, as the following analysis shows:
6 Rg5+ Nh8 7 Rh6+ Ng8 8 2>d4 Sxcl 9 Wxcl! WeS 10
There is now an attack on the two focal-points h7 and g7, combined in some variations with another on f7. If Black plays 10...£te4, there follows 11 Bxe4 dxe4 12 Rg5+ Nh8 13 Sd7! when Black has no proper defence against the threat of 14 h6+ and 15 e7+ winning his queen, e.g. if 13...fie8, then 14 115+ Ng8 15 Rxf7+ mating.

13 Jlxh7+ h8 14 .g6+ with the final mate on f7 .
Into the second group fall focal-points of the same colour which do not qualify as 'a network of squares'. The most typical case is that of h7 and f7, and in the next example we shall examine the most typical attack by the queen and bishop against these two squares. In the following diagram White begins with:
1 Rh5
He is threatening to sacrifice his bishop on h6 because all the essential precon- ditions for such a sacrifice have been fulfilled, as will be seen from the following analysis. We shall examine those replies by Black which lead to the characteristic formation of white queen on h6 and bishop on the bl-h7 diagonal. We shall leave aside the replies 1...Qe6 and l...f6, the first of which is bad because of 2 Bf5 and the second because of 2 1iFg6. Focal-points 107 First of all, the naive capture l...Rxb4?. This is defeated by the sacrifice 2 jlxh6 gxh6 3 Rxh6, threatening mate on h7. This could be parried by 3,..Ee8, but Black then has to pay for the unprotected focal-point at f7 after 4 Bh7+ hS
5 Ng6+ *g8 6 Rh7+ *f8 7 Rxf7#.
We have seen that the square f7 must be protected by the queen, since the rook on f8 has to move after the sacrifice, which suggests 1 ...£}b6 or 1...£}a7. These too are answered by 2 Bxh6 gxh6 3 Rxh6, and if 3...He8, then 4 Rh7+ and 5 Rh8#; nor is there any future in 3,..f6 4 exf6 Hxf6 5 Hxe7 Hxh6 6 Hxb7. Black realizes that his queen is not well placed on e7 because it blocks this es- cape square and thus enables White to mate with his queen on h8. Black can try to move his queen away, but in such a way that it still protects the focal-point f7: L.Rc7 2 Bxh6 gxh6 3 Rxh6 He8 (or 3...f6 4 exf6, with the decisive threat of 5 He7) 4 Had Rd7 5 ±h7+ 4>h8 6 Nf5+ and White wins the queen. From this it can be seen that Black's queen could not even have gone to d7 on the first move. We can now cut our speculation short; there only remain l...He8 and l...Hd8. That l...Hd8 is no good can be seen after 2 Bxh6 gxh6 3 Qxh6, since then l.'.'Vitf) cannot be played because of 4 Rg5+. Thus we arrive at the main variation: l...He8 After this move the sacrifice of the bishop on h6 is somewhat more compli- cated, but it is still White's best continuation. On the other hand, 2 Nf4 is also good; less useful here (as on the first move) is 2 Rg4 because of 2...<4?h8 3 Rxd4 Hd8 4 Rc3 $3b6 and Black can hold his own.
2 Jkxh6 gxh6 3 Rxh6 6
This is the right reply. After 4 Bh7+ <Nh8 White now gets nowhere by 5 g6+, while the other discovered checks fail because White's queen is attacked
108 The Art of Attack in Chess
by Black's; furthermore, if 5 Rh5, Black has the reply 5... g7 6 jLf5 Rh6 with an adequate defence. White's later play is interesting, even if it is no longer as typical of this kind of attack as the possibilities cited hitherto.
4 Rh7+ £f 8 5 Bf5 (D )
White's queen is now best placed where it is, on h7; further checks would only make it easier for Black to defend himself.
5..>c6
After 5... d5 6 Rh6+ Black cannot play 6...Ng8 due to 7 jLh7+ and 8 Be4+, while 6...Ne7 7 Jle4 wins the black bishop, for 7...Rd7 is defeated by 8 e6. 5 ...Rb6 is of no use either, since 6 Sac 1! leaves Black without a reasonable re- ply, e.g. if 6...£te7, then 7 e6 fxe6 8 Bxe6 is quickly decisive. e4 Rb6 7 Bxb7 Rxb7 8 e6 and White wins. The threat is 9 Rh8+ <Ne7 10 exf7+ and the reply 8... d6 fails against 9 e7+ and 10 Rh8#. This analysis shows what great power there is in the formation of queen at h6 and bishop at d3 when combined with a rook at e1 and a pawn at e5. The various operations connected with the focal-points h7 and f7 are well worth remember- ing, since opportunities to use them arise frequently in actual games. Since the defender must move his rook from f8 when mate is threatened at h7, it is clearly a decisive factor whether or not the focal-point f7 is protected by other pieces. An alternative defence involves ...f6 or ...f5, but the success of such a reply depends on the other features of the position, which must be carefully assessed. The main feature of the third group is the network of weak squares of the same colour; here the attacker's bishop is, as a rule, the piece which controls the Focal-points 109 focal -points permanently, while the others are used for manoeuvring purposes. It should be noted that control over a network of squares is also an important factor in positional play, but in attacks on the castled king it is particularly effective. The reason for this is a positional one, since control over a network is often of a fairly permanent nature. The most essential precondition is to 'clear' the network not only of the influence of the opponent's bishop (either by eliminating it or driving it away) but also of possible resistance from the opponent's pawns at im- portant points in the network. When the attacker has 'cleared' the network and fixed the position, the attack- ing operation proper follows; the squares which are candidate focal-points can easily be determined, while the other squares in the network may serve as sec- ondary focal-points or else as strong squares for the attacker to post his pieces on. In the above diagram the network of dark squares is already 'cleared' and cov- ered by White's bishop, which is firmly installed at f6. The network consists of the squares f6, g7 and h8, and also the connected squares f8 and h6. The squares g7 and h8 are candidates as focal-points, f6 is a strong square for the attacker's pieces while f8 and h6 can serve as secondary focal-points or strong squares. All this concentration of white power encircles the unfortunate black king, which has no real prospect of extricating itself from the net and escaping to the queenside, since e7 is also controlled by White. Black does not even have a dark-squared bishop to provide resistance on the network, and because of the blocked position in the centre he cannot undertake a counterattack; he is confined to defending himself. The only minor piece he has left is a knight, but this piece can in fact exercise considerable defensive influence in positions of this kind. If White's domination is based on a dark-square network, Black still has one thing on which he can logically rely - the solid structure of his position on the
110 The Art of Attack in Chess
light squares. In some such cases the success of an attack depends on the ability to break down resistance on the light squares by means of a sacrifice. This fea- ture appears in the analysis of the above position, which, by virtue of its simplic- ity and its typical character, will well repay study. It is Black's move, and his first concern is to provide a defence against White's manoeuvre Rd2-h6, which threatens to bring about disaster on the focal-point g7. Various attempts at defence by Black and attacking stratagems by White, all of them typical and consequently instructive, will now be examined in a series of continuations. A) l...h6 Black is contemplating a defensive system with his king on h7 and his knight on g8, which could be reached after, say, 2 Rd2 h7 3 Se3 £te7 4 Sh3 £}g8. White can then assert his superiority by 5 -&.g5 h5 6 g4, but l...h6 can be better punished as follows:
2 Ee3! <Nh7 3 Sh3 Ne7 4 Sxh6+! 3>xh6 5 Rg4 <Nh7 6 Rh3+ Ng8 7 Rh8#.
Here we see the part played by the focal-points at h6 and h8. B) l...h5 2 Rd2 Nh7 (D) Forced, as White threatened mate by 3 h6; if 2... f8, then 3 Rh6+ also mates. 3Wg5 The simplest answer, as it prevents ...£}e7 for a decisive tempo. Also good is 3 g4, for 3...hxg4 is met by 4 Rg5 and mate. If 3 Se3, Black can defend himself more stubbornly with 3...£te7 4 Sh3 5 g4 Nh6 followed by 6...Sg8.

At this point White gains nothing from checking, but must instead bring his rook to f3.
5.. >c2 6 Sf3 Rxb2 7 Hfl Ra3
This parries the threat of 8 $Lxe7, but now 8 Bg5 £}f5 9 g4 decides the game. In this variation the black king wriggled out to the edge of the network of weak dark squares, but even there he met his fate, its cause being the last square in the network, e7. We shall not leave the above diagram yet, because a feature of very great prac- tical importance should be pointed out. This is the benefit derived by White from the action of his rook on the h-file. Without an opportunity of making the ma- noeuvre Se3-h3, White cannot take Black's position by storm, because he lacks a threat against h7 ; if this does not exist, Black does not have to weaken his posi- tion, since he can easily ward off the threats against g7 alone. So even in this case, where there is a definite 'same-colour network', there is still a part to be played by alternative focal-points on squares of different colours (h7 or f7), and this applies in most practical cases. The weaknesses on the squares of the net- work are usually only the more sensitive ones, which does not mean that squares of the other colour will necessarily be safe - the king may succumb on them too ! We have noted the important part played by the rook on the h-file in the varia- tions above, and we shall now go on to examine how positions of this kind can be exploited if there is no chance of employing a rook. Suppose that we move White's h-pawn from h2 to h4 in the above diagram; this gives a new situation of a type which often arises in practice, for the h-pawn is frequently advanced dur- ing the game. The pawn's being on h4 considerably blunts White's attack, and 1 h4? in the diagrammed position would be a poor move. Nevertheless, even with the pawn on h4 White has the better game, although he can only exploit his ad- vantage slowly and Black retains chances of attacking on the queenside. Indeed, if Black's position on that side were a little further advanced, one could conclude that he would be able to preserve the balance. However, as things stand White is still the stronger, and we shall examine one continuation arising out of the new situation. The modified diagram (with the pawn on h4) is given on the following page.
1...b5 2 Rd2 Re8 3 Se3
In this case too White's rook belongs on h3, even though his attack along the h-file is only a 'thing of the future'.
3...W8 4 Sh3 aS
4.. .h5 would be to White's advantage, since it would simplify his task of open-
ing up the g- and h-files, for example 5 g4 hxg4 6 Sh2 a5 7 h5 followed by 8 hxg6 Focal-points 113 (but not 8 h6? because of 8... h7, and Black is at once in a safe position!) with a decisive attack.
5 h5 b4 6 g3
White's plan, a typical one in positions of this kind, is to play Ng2 and then Sahl. The immediate 6 hxg6 would be weaker, for Black would reply 6...fxg6 opening up the second rank for defensive purposes. White must first of all post his heavy pieces in their assault positions and only then venture on hxg6.
6...a4 7 a3!
Otherwise Black obtains good prospects with ...a3.
7...bxc3 8 bxc3 (D)

8...Na5
A raid by a black rook along the b-file will not succeed, since both rooks are needed to defend the second rank, as can be seen from the following variation:

9 Rg5 Nb3 10 Sei Sc7
Clearly, 10...h6 is bad because of 11 hxg6.
11 Ng2 Saa7 12 Sehl Sab7 13 Sh4! Sd7 14 Sf4 Sdc7
Black is unable to parry the combination which White has prepared. If White had previously made an incorrect exchange on g6, ...Re8 would now be the an- swer to everything; in the present position this move would be answered by 15 Rh6 Rf8 16 xh7+ <Nxh7 17 hxg6+ <Nxg6 18 Sg4+ Nf5 19 Sh5+ <Nxg4 20 Sg5#. 15 hxg6 fxg6 16 Rxg6+! hxg6 17 Sh8+ Nf7 18 Jld8+ and White finally wins. It is well worth remembering this analysis, especially the method of delaying the attack with the h-pawn is and how the winning position is prepared by a cal- culated deployment of the pieces. The reader will be reminded of this extremely important practical technique in the section on the role of the rook files in the at- tack on the castled king. As for the part played by the network of weak squares in attacks on the castled king, one more diagram and one interesting master game will be given as exam- ples. This position is from the game Euwe-Flohr, Amsterdam 1939. White's bishop has reached the square f6, but the network is still guarded by the opponent's dark-squared bishop, which is preparing to effect a delayed fianchetto by ...Bg7. For this reason forceful play by White is indicated. Focal-points 115
1 Bc5!
With the idea of eliminating the dark-squared bishop. If Black plays l...Bxc5, then 2 dxc5 uncovers an attack on the bishop at d7, which Black cannot defend, e.g. if 2...Rc7, the manoeuvre Qe3-h6 is decisive.
1...Rxa2 2 Bh5! e5
If 2...gxh5, then 3 Rg3+ wins, while 2..Jlg7 is answered by 3 Nxg7 Nxg7 4 Sxh7+ ixh? 5 Rxf7+, followed by 6 Bd3. Also interesting is 2...h6 3 e5 ! i'h? 4 Re3 Rxb2 5 Bd3 Wbl+ 6 JLfl g5 (if 6...gxh5, then 7 Re4+ and 8 Eg3+ wins; otherwise Black is mated by 7 Bxh6+ Bxh6 8 Rxh6+ Si?xh6 9 Bh3#) 7 Re4+ <2?g8 8 Bxg5+ hxg5 9 Bh3, etc. The move played parries the threat of 3 Rh3. 3 dxe5 i.e6 4 Rf4 Rxb2 5 £fl Ne7 He still cannot play 5.. Bg7, because of 6 Bxg7 and 7 Rh6+. 6Wh4 Euwe notes in his commentary that Black's queen is fairly well placed on b2 (by controlling f2 and f6 it prevents Rh6 being played at once) and cites as more precise 6 Bbl Rd4 (if 6...Wxbl, then 7 Rh6) 7 Bb4! Rd8 8 Rh4, etc. 6 Bd3 would also win more quickly than the move played.
6...1c5!
The great defensive master's last trump: 7 Exh7? is now no good because of
7...Qxf2+. Even so, Black is lost; the process merely takes a little longer.
7 Bh6 a5
If 7...Bg4, then 8 Ed3 with the threat of 9 Ee3!.
8 Bd3 i.xf2+
Otherwise White will play 9 Bf3.
9 Rxf2 Rxf2+ 10 *xf2 (D)
10...a4
116 The Art of Attack in Chess
The situation now becomes critical; White must get his rook to h3 before Black's pawn promotes to a queen. If 10...Sa6, there is insufficient time for 11 Be2 because of ...Sb6-b3, nor is
11 Ef3 Sb6 12 Kf4 strong enough owing to 12...g5! 13 Sf5 Sc8, and the black
king escapes to d7. Strongest, after 10...Sa6, is 11 g4 Axg4 12 Bh3!, etc. Il&e2 White can also win by 11 g4 Jtxg4 12 Bh3. After the text move Black cannot reply 11 ...a3 because of 12 g4 a2 13 Sxh7, so he tries to prolong the game by a desperate rook sacrifice. ll...Sa5 12 g4 Sxe5 13 Nxe5 Nc4 14 Sdh3 Nxe2 15 Nf6 Se6 16 e5 Nxg4
17 Sxh7 Sxf6+ 18 exf6 1-0
The rook has no difficulty in controlling the pawns, e.g. 18...jLxh3 19 Sxh3 Pilnik - Najdorf Mar del Plata, 1942 Caro- Kann Defence

Sounder is 4...Bf5 or 4... d7 followed by ...£kgf6. 5 xf6+ exf6 The doubling of the pawns on the f-file represents a slight weakness in Black's position whichever pawn he recaptures with.
6 c3 Nd6 7 Nd3 O-O 8 iFh5
Black could answer this with 8...f5 (9 Bxf5? g6) and so ward off White's at- tack without weakening his castled position. Indeed, 8...f5 not only avoids weak- ening Black's position, it also falls in with his correct positional plan, i.e. the front f-pawn is used to control squares on the e-file, while the back one (at f7) stays at home and guards any weaknesses which the front one leaves behind it. If the front pawn is exchanged in some tussle over a square, Black has got rid of the doubled pawns and the fear of an inferior ending.
8 c2 was sounder.
8...g6
Though less precise than 8...f5 this is still not a mistake.
9 Rh4 (D )
9...C5?
Fundamentally inappropriate, since White is stronger on the queenside and in particular has a firm hold on d4. Black should have left any operations on the queen's wing to White and instead prepared for ...f5 and ... d7-f6, but without Focal-points 117 exchanging queens and without relinquishing the d8-h4 diagonal to White. Cor- rect, therefore, was 9...Nd7 10 Ne2 Jte71 11 O-O f5 12 Rg3 £}f6, etc.
10 Ne2 2>c6 11 Jth6 f5?
Black should have played 1 l...fie8. At this point ...f5 is weak.
12 Ng5!
By exchanging queens White could have obtained the better endgame pros- pects. However, why should he play for an endgame when he has the opportunity to gain control of the diagonal h4-d8, thereby obtaining the necessary conditions for an attack on the castled king based on a network of weak dark squares?
12...Rb6
The diagonal cannot be defended: if 12 Le7, then 13 Nxe7 Bxe7 14 dxc5 Rxd3 15 Rxe7 while 12...f6 13 ,Nc4+ h8 14 Bh6 is equally unacceptable1.
13 O-O cxd4 14 cxd4 (D)
14...Se8
Some commentators have marked this move out as the decisive mistake and have suggested 14...jS.e6 (preventing Bc4), but this would make the win easier, e.g. 15 ±f6 Sfe8 (or 15. ..h5 16 Rg5 Nh7 17 d5 Nxd5 18 Nxf5) 16 Nf4! Nxd4 (precluding 17 d5; if 16...Bxf4 17 Rxf4, Black will find himself unable to de- fend the focal-point g7, having given up his dark-squared bishop) 17 Nh5 Nc6
18 Bc3 (18..Be7 comes to the same) 19 Nf6+ Bxf6 20 Bxf6 h5 21 fg5
Nh7 22 and White decides the game by Bxh5. In this analysis, as in other phases of this game, it should be noted that a method has been used which we have already seen in the variations arising from
1 It is hard to see why this latter line is unacceptable. Black may continue with
14...Se8, threatening 15...Se4, and thanks to the move ...f6 Black's kingside
dark squares are not especially weak.
118 The Art of Attack in Chess
the diagram on page 109; namely, in creating threats against a dark-square net- work, White repeatedly makes use of sacrifices on squares of the other colour. These sacrifices fulfil the task of breaking up clusters of pawns which otherwise impede the attacker's access to the weak squares on the network itself. The link- age between the operations on the networks of different colours should be noted; on one network the intention is to keep the attacking pieces in the strongest and most permanent positions possible, while on the other they are sacrificed when the situation demands. It should finally be pointed out that, instead of the move played, 14...Qxb2? would have been bad because of 15 fifbl Ra3 16 Sb3 Ra5 17 -Nf6 fie8 18 jlc4, when White's prospects for an attack are greatly improved. 15 -*.c4 h5 (D) There was a threat of 16 Bxf7+ Nxf7 17 Rxh7+ Ne6 18 d5+ ?xd5 19 Sadl+. If 15 e6, then 16 d5 would naturally follow. Focal-points 119
16 Eael?
After this move Black gains drawing chances. In such an attractive position one would expect to find a safe and clear way to victory. White here has all the necessary ingredients for success: control over a dark-square network; advantage in development; two pieces to break up the cluster on the light squares (bishop at c4 and knight at e2); and as well as all this, a pawn in the centre that prevents Black from using his e5 square as a post for his pieces! Stronger and simpler would have been 16 Nf6!, as the following lines show: 1) 16... .e7 17 Rg5 Bxf6 18 Rxg6+.
24 Jkxe5 and 25 Rh8+.
3) 16...Se4 17 Rg5 Nf8 18 £k3 !, and the black rook has no good square to go to: 18...fixd4 is inadequate because of 19 Efel, while 18...Sg4 is answered by

and mate is unavoidable.
16...Se4 17 Nf4 Rxd4 18 Bxe4 fxe4?
This pawn blocks the fourth rank to White's advantage. Black should have played 18...Rxc4, when 19 Nxg6 Rxh4 20 xh4 leads to an ending in which White is the better placed, but Black can still salvage a draw by 20... jLe6 21 Bd3 (or 21 Ng7! when 22 Bxh5 fails against 22...f6 and 23...Sh8) 21...f4 threat- ening both the a-pawn and 22... g7 followed by 23...f6.

The only reply. If 21...Be6 then 22 Sd5! Rxc4 (or 22... .xd5 23 Rxh5) 23 g5+ Nf8 24 Sxd6 and mates, while 21... jle7 22 Ed5 Bxf6 loses to 23 Rg3+. 22 b4!

This move is refuted by 2O...Rxf2+!! and Black forces mate himself. However, Vukovic's attacking plan is basically correct, except that White has to exercise a little more care: 20 Rh6+ eS 21 Rg7 Nd8 22 Eael and now 22...Rxf2+ 23 Exf2 Exel+ 24 Efl Jlc5+ fails, because after 25 .d4 the bishop is defended.

6 The classic bishop sacrifice1
This sacrifice deserves a chapter to itself, because it is the oldest and most ex- plored of all the sacrifices involved in the attack on the castled king and also be- cause it provides particularly good illustrations of the role of h7 and f7 as mating and secondary focal-points. The earliest instance of the sacrifice of the bishop on h7 followed by £}g5+ oc- curs in Gioacchino Greco's handbook of 1619, but the first systematic review of it was made by E. Vbellmy in his article 'On attacking the castled king' in the Schweizerischen Schachzeitung in 1911. Some writers give it the name of Greco's sacrifice, for which there are some grounds, while others call it Colle's sacrifice, for which there is in fact no justification, as Colle never played a good game which contained the sacrifice in spite of the fact that he often used it. I think the term 'classic bishop sacrifice' more appropriate, since this indicates both its early origins and also the basic simplicity of the idea underlying it. Greco reaches the position below in his handbook after making six not partic- ularly intelligent moves. Now comes the blow: 1 Jtxh7+! Nxh7 2 Ng5+ Ng8 (if 2...Bxg5, then 3 hxg5+ Ng6 4 Rh5+ Nf5 5 Rh3+ g6 6 Rh7#; 2... <Nh6 3 xe6+ costs Black his queen; thirdly, after 2...<Ng6 3 h5+ there is a choice between 3...Nh6 4

ing this term specifically to the sacrifice on h7 is unclear.

£}xe6+ and 3... ?f5 4 g4#) 3 Rh5 Se8 (or 3.. Jkxg5 4 hxg5 f5 5 g6) 4 Rh7+ Nf8 5 8#. Let us now consider the next, rather more natural, position, where the classic sacrifice is again successful.
1 Nxh7+ Nxh7 2 g5+
Here, as in other examples of the classic bishop sacrifice, there are three main variations arising from the sacrifice, i.e. those beginning with ...Ng8, ...Nh6, and These three variations must be carefully examined on every occa- sion, for if any one of them contains a loophole, the whole combination falls to the ground. 1) variation with ... g8
2.. .6g8 3 Rh5 Se8 4 Rxf7+ Nh8 5 Rh5+ #g8 6 Rh7+ Nf8 7 Rh8+ Ne7 8
Rxg7#. This variation contains, as its main feature, a typical example of an attack us- ing h7 and f7 as secondary focal-points with the queen finally mating on g7, a common enough pattern after this sacrifice. 2) variation with ...Nh6
2... h6 3 xe6+ and 4 Nxd8, etc.
This naturally succeeds because Black's queen is on d8, but even with the queen on a5 the move 2...Nh6 would have no prospects. In that case White would win by, e.g. 3 Rg4 Sh8 (otherwise Rh4+ and Rh7#) 4 Nxe6+ and 5 Qxg7#. 3) variation with ... g6
2...6g6 3 h4
This is the strongest move here; in other cases ... gb may be best met by g4. Black's reply is forced. The classic bishop sacrifice 123
3...Hh8 4 h5+! Sxh5 5 Rd3+ f5 6 exf6+ Nxf6 7 Rf3+ Ne7 8 Rf7+ £<16 9
Rxh5 and White wins. One could now produce a series of examples, pursuing different variations ac- cording to the various elements in each position, but it is more to the point at once to pose the question as to how to judge the correctness of the sacrifice, first with reference to White's position and then to Black's. Necessary conditions for the classic bishop sacrifice White must firstly have a queen, a bishop and a knight. The light-squared bishop must be able to reach h7 in order to force the tempo of the attack, though it is not essential that it should put Black in check or take a pawn in so doing. The knight should be within easy and safe reach of the square g5, and the queen within reach of h5, though in some cases it is enough for it to be able to get to some other square on the h-file. As far as Black 's position is concerned, there should be two pawns standing intact at f7 and g7 (g7 may on rare occasions be occupied by a bishop instead of a pawn); the h-pawn should be on h7 (on h5 in exceptional cases), but it may be that there is no h-pawn at all. The position of Black's queen on d8 and a rook on f8 points to, but does not absolutely guarantee, the correctness of the sacrifice. What is more important is that Black's knight should not be able to reach f6 and that neither his queen nor bishop should be able to occupy the h7-bl diagonal un- harmed. These are the basic conditions which need to be taken into account. In the ex- amples which follow we shall examine to what extent each of these conditions is fulfilled; the positions are chosen in such a way as to show which is the critical continuation in each example, i.e. the one that is in doubt because a certain condi- tion is apparently unfulfilled. The variation with ...<Ng8 is critical In the following position the sacrifice is correct: 1 ,Nxh7+ Nxh7 2 Ng5+ Ng8 The continuation 2...Nh6 obviously fails; while if 2...Ng6, then 3 Rd3+ f6 (3...f5 4 Rg3! wins, for Black cannot play 4...Nf6 because of 5 Sxe6#) 4 Re4 threatens both 5 Nh7+ and 5 Nxe6, and 4... ?e7 does not work because of 5 Rxe6+ fxe6 6 Sxe6#.
3 Rh5 f6
An example of the defence of the focal-point h7 by the knight, but in this case
124 The Art of Attack in Chess
White's position is strong enough (thanks to the activity of his bishop on f4 and rook on el) to withstand the loss of time.
4 Rh4 He8

5 Jke5 Re7
If 5...'Nf8, then 6 Rh8+ and 7 Rxg7 is decisive. 6 fie3 Bd8 7 Hh3 and White mates. In the position in the next diagram an important condition regarding the ...Ng8 variation has apparently not been fulfilled, since the diagonal from c8 to f5 is open to Black's bishop. However, White has the possibility of Re4+ as well as other active factors in his favour, and therefore the sacrifice still succeeds.

3...f5 4 1 114 Sf7 5 UftiS+l 1 Nxh8 6 Nxf7+ Ng8 7 <Nxd8 and White wins.
Here the boxed-in position of Black's rook and the possibility of Re4+ fol- lowed by Rh4 fully compensate for the absence of one of the basic conditions. In this position Black has an extra tempo in which to defend himself after ...Ng8 because his rook is already on e8, but White's position is so strong in other respects that his sacrifice still leads to a successful breakthrough.
1 Nxh7+ Nxh7 2 Ng5+ <3?g8 3 Rh5 £rf8
A difficulty for Black is that he cannot defend the f7-square; if, for example,
3...Re7, then 4 Rh7+and5 Rh8# while if 3...f6, then4 Rf7+ < r'h8 5 Se3, etc.
4 Rxf7+ 'i'hS 5 fie3 and White wins.
These three examples represent only a small section of a large number of pos- sible cases in which the crucial continuation is ... g8. How large the variety of these positions is and how sensitive they are to minute changes can be illustrated by the following observation: if, in any of the previous three diagrams, White's h-pawn is moved to h4, the bishop sacrifice is no longer correct. In the first two diagrams (on page 124) this is because the queen is prevented from getting to h4, while in the diagram above it is because White's rook can no longer create threats along the h-file. Having the pawn on h4 rather than h2 is an obstacle in the varia- tion with ...Ng8; on the other hand, we shall see how it assists White in the varia- tion with ,.. g6. 1 5 e6 is even stronger, when 5...Rxg5 is forced to avoid mate.

The variation with ... g6 is critical Here the critical continuation is ... gb, while that with ...Ng8 involves less diffi- culty.

5...Sh8 6 xe6+ *f7 7 xg7+ <Nxe6 8 Rf6+ <Nd7 9 Rd6#.
This is a characteristic outcome of the continuation ... g6; with the king on g6, the pawn on h4 is an assistance to White, as it usually is when Black adopts this defence. In the next case White has no pawn on e5, but the presence of his rook on the open e-file ensures success against ...Ng8. In the variation with ...Ng6 White is made to work for victory.

If 2...Nh6, both 3 Nxf7+ and 3 Rg4 4 Nce4 lead to victory. Instead of the dark-squared bishop White has the knight on c3 as an active supporting piece, which proves its value in numerous variations. Consider, for example, 2...( )g8 3 h5 Rd3, where the fact that White has the move 4 ce4 is decisive.

The variation with ...< h6 is critical This continuation is usually difficult for the attacker if he does not have a second bishop and has his h-pawn at h4, and is consequently without the possibility of g4 and h4+. The classic bishop sacrifice 129 Here is an example: 1 i.xh7+ <Nxh7 2 Ng5+ Nh6 Against either of the other continuations White wins easily, but against the text move he has to work hard; victory cannot be forced here, though he has a promising attack. 3f4! This is probably White's strongest move. After 3 Rd2 Re7! White can re- establish material equality by 4 £jxe6+ and 5 Nxf8, but Black is then the better placed.
3...Ne7 4 h5 g6 5 hxg6 Nxg6 6 Rg4 *g7 7 f5! exf5 8 fixfS
White's threats include 9 Hxf7+ and 9 e6, as well as 9 Rh5, so he should win. If 8.. Bc8, then 9 Rh5 is decisive. Declining the sacrifice One of the necessary conditions for the success of the classic bishop sacrifice, as of any sacrifice at all, is the opponent's inability to obtain an advantage by reject- ing the sacrifice altogether. The attacker must therefore consider what will hap- pen if his opponent plays ...Nh8 and does not take the bishop. The following diagram shows an example of this.
1 Bxh7+?
Instead of trying to sacrifice his bishop (which is incorrect in this position, since Black can successfully decline it) White should have played 1 Be2 with the intention of making use of his pair of bishops and centralizing his knight by l... h8! 2 Ng5
130 The Art of Attack in Chess
The bishop has nowhere to retreat to, while if 2 Re2, then 2... ,xf3 3 Rxf3 < 'xh7, i.e. Black accepts the sacrifice as soon as he has eliminated White's knight, for without that White's attack is worth nothing.
2...Wxdl 3 flfxdl g6!
White now has no satisfactory defence against the threat of ...Ng7 and ...Hh8, and this gives Black the better prospects. A practical criterion for the sacrifice We shall now attempt to establish a practical rule for positions of the type given on pages 122-129, a means by which players can orientate themselves quickly and fairly accurately. Positions similar to that on page 121, i.e. with a rook on hl and pawn on h4, will be left aside for the time being and will be dealt with in chapter 7. It should also be remarked that in the positions on pages 122-129 the basic condition that the defender should not be able to reject the sacrifice un- scathed was fulfilled. It should further be added that the arrangement of Black's pieces in those positions did not depart greatly from the normal, while White, in addition to the essential light-squared bishop, the queen, and the knight on f3, had at his disposal a number of other supporting pieces to sustain his attack. Listed in categories, these were: Pawn at e5 and bishop at cl on pages 122, 124 (bottom) and 125; Pawn at e5 and bishop at f4 on page 126; Pawn at e5 and knight at d2 on page 127 (bottom); Pawn at e5 and knight at c3 on page 128; Pawns at e5 and h4 on page 129; Rook at el and bishop at f4 on page 124 (top); and Rook at el and bishop at cl on page 127 (top). The classic bishop sacrifice 131 As can be seen, the principal supporting pieces are the pawn at e5 and the bishop on the diagonal cl-f4, followed by the knight on d2 or c3 and the rook on the open e-file. There may be a few other such supporting pieces (e.g. a rook on fl, if the f-file is open) which have not been provided with examples, but the reader will already have seen the basic idea - as a rule at least two active support- ing pieces are necessary, if the classic bishop sacrifice is to bring the attacker success. This is a simple practical criterion and should help the player to get his ap- proximate bearings. To make this survey of the sacrifice and the structure of its necessary conditions as clear as possible, White has been made the attacker in all the examples; if Black carries out a sacrificial attack on h2, naturally all that has been said applies analogously. To provide further material on the classic bishop sacrifice three master games will now be examined. The first belongs to the post-war era and provides an ex- ample where the sacrifice is quite correct. In the second the young Capablanca sacrifices on h7, but the analysis shows the existence of a loophole in the varia- tion with ... g6 which his opponent failed to notice. In the third, Colle sacrifices and wins both the game and the Brilliancy Prize, even though in fact two of the variations are unsound!

132 The Art of Attack in Chess
16 Bxh7+!
Here is an example of the classic bishop sacrifice on h7 in a position which differs from those examined hitherto. First of all, a bishop, and not a pawn, is on g7, while Black's queen is on b6 and not on d8. Let us now look at the conditions for success in each of the variations. Clearly, ... h8 does not come into consider- ation at all, nor does moving the king to h6, but the variation with ... gS gives rise to a few doubts, since the bishop's presence on g7 prevents the well-known harrying of the king by Rh8+. We shall see later on how really critical this varia- tion is and that White's success hangs on a thread. The ...Ng6 variation presents an even harder prospect, for White has only one of the supporting pieces men- tioned above (bishop at cl) at his disposal and still needs an extra tempo to make up the necessary pair with Sei. Furthermore, Black's queen is not imperilled on b6 by the battery of queen on g4 and knight on g5, as is the case when it is on d8; moreover, Black's considerable strength in the centre and on the queenside opens up the possibility of defending by returning the material and exploiting the posi- tional compensation obtained for it. According to our scheme, then, the continu- ation ...<Ng6 represents a danger to White, and we should have to doubt the success of the attack if it were not for one more factor which helps White: the fact that a bishop, and not a pawn, stands at g7 means that an attack on that square en- tails the loss of a piece and not of a pawn. While the bishop on g7 helps Black in the ... g8 variation, with ... g6 it acts as a drawback which compensates for the deficiencies in White's position already referred to. These points will be best il- luminated by further analysis.
16... xh7 17 g5+ Ng6
Let us now consider the alternative continuation, 17. After 18 Rh5 Sd8 19 xf7+ Nh8 all the commentators (including the author in his Modern Open- ing Theory) have given a win for White by 20 f4 Rb7 21 5f3?. However, there is The classic bishop sacrifice 133 a flaw in this, in that Black can embark upon 21... xf7 22 £}xf7+ gS 23 £}xd8, obtaining excellent compensation for the exchange, e.g. 23... .d7 24 b4 Na4 25 4}b7 .c6 26 £k5 (or 26 Na5) 26...Bxf3 27 gxf3 d3 28 Sbl £te3 and Black wins the cl-bishop at the very least. This scotches the idea of 21 2f3?; a better move therefore, is 21 Rg6, though after 21...Ng8 22 Sf3 Re7 23 Sh3 24 fih8+!) White only has a draw by 24 £}h7+ g8 25 £jg5, etc. If he plays for a material advantage with 24 Hh8+? Jlxh8 25 h7+ Rxh7 26 Rxh7, then

(otherwise selves felt. These variations, however, do not comprise a full coverage of 17... g8; in- stead of 20 f4 White has a better move, i.e. 20 jkf4!. Here is an analysis: 1) 2O...£ki7 21 Nxe6 wins. 2) 20...£ki3 21 Rg6! picks up the knight. 3) 2O...Rb7 fails against 21 Bc7. 4) 20...e5 21 Bxe5 Rh6 22 Re7!

As can be seen, a considerable analytical effort was needed to overcome a de- fence built round the fianchetto, and more will be said about this in a separate chapter.
18 Rg4 f5 19 Rg3 (D)
A critical stage of the game. It is now evident that the position of his bishop at g7 is an embarrassment to Black, since there is an immediate threat of <2}xe6+ with a double attack on g7 and f8.
134 The Art of Attack in Chess
In the actual game Black played 19... f6, but that move, like 19...Bf6, does not cause White as much difficulty as 19...Sf7!, as the following variations show: 1) 19..Bf6 20 £jxe6+ sfcf7 21 xf8 xf8 22 Rg6 £te4! (Black's strongest defence; White cannot now play 23 f3 because of 23...d3+ 24 hl d2 and Black has at least equal chances1) 23 Bh6+ e7 24 f3 d3+ 25 hl Nf2+ 26 Sxf2 Rxf2
27 Rh7+ Ne6 2 28 Rg8+ Ne5 29 Re8+ Nd4 30 Rc6, with advantage to White.
2) 19...2f7! (this move was suggested by Kovaliev, who considered that it saved Black's game, but his analysis did not take into account the important in- termediate move 20 b4!) 20 b4! and now: 2a) 20...Nd7 21 £}xe6+ h7 (or 21...Nf6 22 £"c7! and White wins) 22 Sei f6 23 Ng5+ Ng8 24 Nxf7 Nxf7 25 Se7+ <Nxe7 26 Rxg7+ Ne6 27 Ng5 and White's attack cannot be withstood. 2b) 20... a4 21 h4! e5 22 h5+ *f6 23 Sei Se7 24 i.f4 exf4 25 Nh7+ t'7
26 Sxe7+ < xe7 27 xg7+. White's attack is extremely strong and the advance
of his h-pawn must be decisive. This analysis does not exhaust the position en- tirely but it does illustrate White's excellent chances.
19...Nf6 20 i.f4! (D)
Keres had already analysed 16 Bxh7+ and its consequences before this game took place. At this point he gave the continuation 20 Rh4? on which Black plays
1 This is a considerable exaggeration. After 25 fxe4 dxclW 26 fiaxc 1 White has a
material advantage and a strong attack - indeed this line seems clearer than 23 .h6+. 2 27...' 'd6 is a much better defence. After 28 JiLf8+ e6 29 Rg8+ sS?e5 White is deprived of the check on e8 and so the position remains unclear. The classic bishop sacrifice 135 2O...Sh8 and White gets no more than perpetual check. Kotov knew of this anal- ysis, which explains why he went in for 15...Nc5?. Now Kottnauer shows that White has a stronger move than 20 Rh4? and in doing so demonstrates that not even the analysis of great masters is always reliable.

Black is correct to choose the ...<4'g6 variation and the reader - armed with the guidance given a few pages back - will notice that White's chances of success in this case are dubious, since he does not have the two necessary supporting pieces, but only one, and a fairly weak one at that (the knight on c3).
14 Rg4 f5
As a lover of fine combinations from his earliest youth, Capablanca here quotes the following continuation: 14...e5? 15 ?f6 16 f4! e4 (or 16...Nc6 17 g5+ Nxe6 18 f5+ Nd7 19 Sfdl+ Nd4 20 Rxg7 when White will get one piece back and have three pawns for his knight plus a winning attack against Black's exposed king) 17 Rg5+ 18 Re5+ <4>d7 19 Sfdl+ 4hd3 20 £}xe4 'i'cb 21 Sxd3 Rxd3 22 Scl+ and mate in a few moves.
15 Rg3 < h6?
This game has entered the anthologies as one of Capablanca's famous feats because commentators have passed this obviously incorrect move by in silence. By 15...sS?f6! Black could have shown that the bishop sacrifice was unsound. White can then still exert some pressure (after 16 Sadi jkd7 or 16 b4 Na6), but he has not got the time to strengthen his attack decisively, since Black threatens to consolidate his position (e.g. 16 e4 g6 or 16 f4 Sh8). White must therefore take the exchange by 16 £}h7+ with the result that his attack comes to a halt, leaving him without sufficient compensation for Black's material advantage . In addition to 15...Sfelf6!, another move which is better than the one played is
15...f4, which would force White to play for a draw, i.e. 16 exf4 f5 17 Rg4
Nh6 18 3 Nf5, etc2.

19 exf5? This makes it easier for Black to defend himself and throws away the opportu- nity of e5+; it is uncertain whether White now has the advantage or not.

This game, here given a proper critical commentary for the first time, provides yet another blow against the legend of 'the infallible Cuban'. Another interesting point is that Capablanca often undertook attacks against the castled king in his earlier years, but extremely rarely as he became older. This was to a certain extent the result of the progressively greater ability of his
1 The strongest defence is 23...Nd8!, which prevents 24 Nb5 owing to 24...€Be2+.
In this case White would have a draw at best. The classic bishop sacrifice 139 opponents and a general rise in standards, but it was perhaps even more because of a gradual waning of enthusiasm under the weight of increasing self-criticism. Unlike Capablanca, Alekhine played in his own style from his youth right till the end, accepting the risk of difficult attacks against the castled king even against strong opponents.

7 Ranks, files and diagonals in
the attack on the castled king An action in the vicinity of the castled king can be carried out by any of the pieces, but the long-range ones, the queen, rook, and bishop, are the most effec- tive. They can attack from a distance along the ranks, files, and diagonals. The line concerned has to be 'captured,' i.e. one's own long-range piece has to be placed on it, confrontation by the opponent's corresponding piece has to be over- come, and the line has to be 'cleared' of all enemy influence. Outposts lie on such lines; batteries and pins take place along them. In a mating attack the line may fi- nally witness the execution, i.e. checkmate. In this chapter we shall consider in turn the part played in the attack on the castled king by the ranks, files, and diago- nals and reveal some typical operations involving them. The weakness of the back rank Of operations on the ranks, the first class to be considered is that aimed at a weakness on the back rank. A few practical examples will help. This position is from Bemstein-Capablanca, Exhibition Game, Moscow 1914. It is White's move, and he ought to have realized that because of his weakness on the back rank Black's pawn on c3 was 'taboo' . He should therefore have played 1 <Nd4, but he decided not to, and the result was a disaster on his back rank. Ranks, files and diagonals in the attack on the castled king 143

But not 3... bl+V 4 Wfl, in which case 4...fidl is impossible because of Black's weakness on his own back rank. However, the move 3...1iifb2, typical of Capablanca, solves the problem completely: White resigned, for he is unable to take the queen and his own rook and queen are threatened; if 4 Rd3 or 4 fid3, then 4...Wal+ wins. This position is from Mikenas-Maroczy, Folkestone 1933. White, to move, advanced his e-pawn to exploit Black's weakness on the back rank.

In this position, which occurred in the game Najdorf-Julio Bolbochan, Mar del Plata 1948, White exploited Black's back-row weakness by an operation in which his passed pawn played a typically prominent part. 1 2xd8! Sxd8

Since after 4...Stxgl+ 5 't'xgl Black cannot halt the d-pawn. This position is from the game Alekhine-E. Cohn, Stockholm 1912. White, to move, must try to retain his extra pawn. A 'realistic' tournament player would quietly play 1 Hfel c5 24klf3 and Bf2...jLxc2, then3Scl,orif2...f6, then3exf6 Sxel+ 4 £}xel, etc. However, this seemed too limp a solution to the young Alekhine, who wanted to keep Black's knight in its corner at h6 a little longer; in a typically 'incisive' way he defended the pawn on e5 indirectly, or rather 'sold it for the back rank' , and this is in fact as good a method as that given above.

A little more spice; if 2...Hxc5, then 3 de6 wins a rook.
2...Ha6?
He could have put up more resistance by 2...Sf6, for 3 Nf5 does not achieve much because of 3...Nf8. Correct would be 3 £}gf3!, against which Black must play 3...Se8, but not 3...Sxc5? on account of 4 £}f5 !, when White wins the ex- change at the very least1. 3 de6? This only leads to a small material advantage, whereas he could have won con- vincingly by 3 £}b5!2, which is equally effective in stopping Black's rook from returning to the back rank (with the help of Nxc7) but at the same time does not Ranks, files and diagonals in the attack on the castled king 145 leave the knight en prise at e6. This point is demonstrated by the following varia- tions: 1) 3...Nh8 4 Ed8+ Ng8 5 Nxf7+ $Lxf7 6 Exf7, and Black loses his knight while White's on b5 remains intact. 2) 3...f6 4 Nxc7 Exa2 5 Sd8+ Be8 6 Nxe8 Nf8 7 Nxc7+ e7 8 Se8#.
3...Nh8

5 xc7 White cannot play 5 Sxf7 because of 5...Eaxe6, while if 5 <£jxf7+ Bxf7 6 Sxf7 fiaxe6 7 fiff8 White merely regains the piece he has lost - that is the differ- ence between the knight's position on b5 and e6. Even more instructive is the fact that 5 Sfdl? will not work because of 5...Saxe6! 6 Nxe6 fxe6, and there is no mate (by Exg8+ and Ed8+) since Black has freed the square f7.
1 An interesting moment. After 2...Ef6 3 Ngf3 He8, as Vukovic gives, it is hard
to see what White has gained in return for surrendering his extra pawn. Of course, White retains a positional advantage, but this is far from conclusive. Cu- riously, in the English edition of his best games collection, Alekhine does not mention 2...Ef6, but in his Deux Cents Parties d'Echecs he gives "On 2...Ef6, White wins by 3 Nf5 !, etc.". Probably both 3 Ngf3 and 3 f5 are wrong; the strongest line is 3 £k:6 ! He8 (3...flxfl+ 4 < ?xfl Ee8 5 Ed7 is also very bad) 4 £}e7+ 5 Efel !, threatening 6 Nxg6+, and Black's position is hopeless (5...i.f5 6 g4 or 5...±c2 6 Ed2).

by Alekhine.

One might now say 'and White won after another twenty moves', for this posi- tion no longer has anything to do with the difficulties on the back rank, but it is worth remarking that the task is a difficult one, so difficult indeed that Alekhine went astray and after 14...£al+ 15 4*12 4d5 16 4f3 a5 played 17 4e2? (17 £k?d2 was correct). This was answered by 17...a4! (not 17...4xe4? on account of 18 c6!), after which White, objectively speaking, should not have got more than a draw. Alekhine, however, did not submit to 18 £jc3+ <4x05 19 < xa4+ 4d4 but went on to risk 18 £ted2? a3 19 b4 Sell and so reached a losing position. Play continued 20 4d3 a2 21 Nb3 Sdl+ 22 4>c2 alV 23 xal Sxal 24 Nc3+, at which stage Black could have won by 24,..<4c4! 25 c6 Sa7 ! 26 b5 Sc7. Instead, he spoilt his position by playing 24...'4c6? The finish ran: 25 4>d3 Sfl 26 g3! h5 27 4>c4 h4 28 b5+ <4d7 29 gxh4 Sf4+ 30 4>d5 Sxh4 31 c6+ Nc7 32 <4c5! 2xh3 33 b6+ <4b8 34 <Nb5 1-0 Combinations based on the weakness of the back rank are usually of short du- ration and matters come quickly to a head. This has been shown by the examples given above, and others, equally short-lived, could easily be added to them. How- ever, just as success may come quickly, so too failure can suddenly occur as a result of a lightning counter-stroke which removes the weakness from the oppo- nent's back rank. As an example of such a turning-point let us examine the next position. Ranks, files and diagonals in the attack on the castled king 147 Flohr, when he was White in this position from a simultaneous display played in Leningrad during 1933, continued: 1 fixe 5 and left his opponent to think it over.
1...W12+
Both Flohr and the commentators thought that Black, in making this move, had fallen into a trap, but in fact he has nothing better. For example, if l...Be6, then 2 Wei Sae8 (or 2.. Bf5 3 Ee7) 3 Bb5 Bd7 4 h6! (not 4 Sf3 because of
4.. .Rxh5) 4... .xb5 (if 4...g6, White wins with 5 Ef3) 5 Exg7+ Rxg7 6 hxg7

2 Nh2 Wxfl?!
This is a comparative mistake only, since Black's game is now lost in any case.
2...Rf4 would have offered more resistance.
3 Rxd5+ < h8
If 3...Rf7, White wins by 4 Se7!. 4Ef3? This was intended to be the decisive stroke, but in fact it is a mistake. White would easily have won by 4 h6, and if 4...g6, then 5 Ef 3; alternatively, if 4...gxh6 then 5 Ee8, after which mate is unavoidable. This variation shows the correct way to exploit the weakness on the back rank, while 4 Ef3? was inadequate as Black had the reply 4.. Be6!, when by returning the extra piece he could have got rid of the weakness on his back rank with tempo and reached a drawn position. As it was, however, he played 4...Exf3?, and everything was immediately put

148 The Art of Attack in Chess
right: White replied 5 Rxf3, and Black with good reason resigned (1-0). This example shows what vigilant care needs to be taken with combinations aimed at a weakness on the back rank. In connection with this back-row weakness, something should also be said about the so-called 'escape hole', i.e. the gap made by moving a pawn with the sole purpose of eliminating the danger of mate on the back rank or at least of freeing the rook guarding the rank. On the other hand, such a move, like any pawn move in front of the castled king, represents a weakening of the position, and it is a question here of correctly assessing whether the advantages involved outweigh the weaknesses or vice versa. This is one of the numerous double- edged features of chess. As an example of the sensitivity of the connection between the weakness of the back rank and that of the 'escape hole' the above position is instructive. It is Black's move, and if it were not for his weakness on the back rank, the problem would be an extremely straightforward one: White's pawns on the queenside would fall one by one. Thus it is a question of first averting the danger on the back rank and only then making the time to 'pick off' the pawns. Let us create an 'escape hole' for the king. I...h6? A mistake? Yes, and a bad one, for Black is now faced with a new weakness on g6. The other 'hole', l...g6, is no good either, since White can get an easy draw by 2 £}g4 (with the threat of €Bf6 and mate on h7) 2...Sf8 (or 2...Bf8 3 h6) 3 h6 Sf5 (the only move; for if 3...b5, 4 Sd5 is a strong reply, while 3... g8? is not good on account of 4 2g7+ and 5 £}e5) 4 Sd8+ Sf8 (4...Bf8? 5 £te3 and 6

and Black must lose. As we have seen, the 'escape holes' did not work; in this position they repre- sent too great a weakness, so the only correct continuation is 1... g8!, which re- moves the danger on the back rank without weakening the pawn position. What is more, Black must also avoid moving his pawns if White continues with his sharpest reply, 2 h6 ! (since if 2...gxh6, White can draw by 3 £}g4). He should in- stead play the solid 2...Bf8, after which he can reap his pawn harvest with ...Exa2, etc. Another typical variation is 2 Ng4 (instead of 2 h6) 2...Exa2 3 Ne5 Exb2 4 Ed8+ Bf8 5 #ki7 Exc2+ 6 f3 Nf7. Now one can appreciate the signifi- cance of White's lack of an outpost for his knight - he wins the bishop by 7 Nxf8 but Black, with 7...b3, wins the game1. The sensitivity of 'escape holes' of this kind can best be seen if White's pawn on h5 is moved to h4. Then, as well as l.-.'&gS, Black may also play l...h6, a fact of which the reader may convince himself by his own analysis. The weakness of the second rank The second rank, on which the pawns stand at the start of the game, is generally as weak as the back rank; the pawns stand on it but do not protect it. There is, however, a difference, in that the second rank is harder to 'clear' prior to its being used by a rook or queen because the pawns tend to get in the way, just as trees in a forest tend to obstruct a clear view. Consequently, weaknesses on the second rank most frequently appear on individual squares or focal-points, and it is rarer to find a general weakness affecting the whole rank. The latter phenomenon, This is all rather confusing. After what Vukovic considers to be Black's best continuation, l.-. gS 2 Ng4 Exa2, White can play 3 h6 forcing 3...Bf8 (or else perpetual check), but after l...Bf8 2 Ng4 Exa2, which Vukovic condemns on account of 3 h6, Black can reach exactly the same position by playing 3... ?g8!. The truth of the matter is that l... ?g8 and l... .f8 work equally well, because neither weakens the kingside pawn structure.

which concerns us here, is generally described as 'a rook on the seventh rank', but it would be more accurate to speak of a strongly-placed queen or rook on the opponent's second rank. This kind of situation is on the whole exploited for positional purposes (to put pressure on the pawns and capture them or else to prevent the opponent from moving his king into the centre), but the position of a queen or rook on the sev- enth rank can also be useful in an attack on the castled king, where a 'clearing up' operation is often of decisive importance. A weakness on the second rank often goes hand in hand with a weakness on the back rank. The following combination of Rubinstein's makes effective use of both ranks . This position occurred in the game Rubinstein-Maroczy, Gothenburg 1920. White's first act was to advance his pawn to h6 and so create the necessary condi- tions for an attack on the seventh rank.
1 h5 f8 2 h6!
White now threatens 3 Bh4, which would also be decisive in the event of
2...gxh6.
2.. .£"g6 3 Re6!
Now White takes advantage of the weakness of the back rank to penetrate with his queen; 3...2xe6 is met by 4 Sd8+, while if 3,..Hce7, then 4 hxg7+.
3...5.8 4 Sd7
The position is ripe for the rooks to take possession of the seventh rank. Black is now forced to play 4...gxh6, after which the 'clearing' of the rank is complete.
4...gxh6 5 ±h4! 1-0
The threat of .xf6+ compels 5...<Nxh4, but then White achieves total domina- tion of the seventh rank (by 6 Re7 followed by mate on h7). Ranks, files and diagonals in the attack on the castled king 151 The reader should note the methodical character of this combination and espe- cially the part played by the 'clearing-up' operation. In this position from the game Nimzowitsch-Capablanca, New York 1927, Black's rook is already on the seventh rank, but its bite is not yet fully felt be- cause of the pawn in the way at f2. To obtain complete control over the rank, Black sacrifices a pawn, which enables him to double rooks. I...e5! 2 i.xe5 Zdd2 3 Rb7 (D) If 3 Wfl, Black's strongest line is 3...Rd5 4 Jlf4 (or 4 Bd4) 4...Rf3 5 Rg2 Rxg2+ 6 xg2 Zxf2+ 7 Nh3 (or7 gl 2g2+8 hl Hxh2+ 9 igl f6)7...h5! 8 Shi jLe7 9 Bad g5 and White loses his bishop owing to the threat of ...g4#. If 3 Zfl, then 3...Rxe3! is decisive (4 Bf4 Hxf2), since White cannot take the queen for fear of being mated by the rooks. These two alternatives are instructive illustrations of the use of rooks on the seventh rank.
152 The Art of Attack in Chess
3.. .5xf2 4 g 4 Re6 5 Ng3 Sxh2! 6 Rf3
If 6 Bxh2, then 6,..Rxg4+ 7 &hl Rh3 and White is mated, for he cannot de- fend both the focal-points g2 and h2 with his queen.
6.. JXg2+ 7 Rxg2 Hxg2+ 8 <Nxg2 Rxg4 and Black won as a result of his mate-
rial superiority. The last example in this group is meant to take the reader away from the usual pattern. In this position from the game Flohr-Stoltz, Warsaw 1935, White has some pressure on the seventh rank but lacks reinforcements. Thus after 1 Bc4 f8 2 Ba6 Black has the reply 2...Jtb8! , and the position resolves itself into an ending with bishops of opposite colours. This is not enough for White, and he sees that a successful invasion is possible on the sixth, rather than the seventh, rank. Otherwise Black cannot stop the mating attack starting with Rxg6+. If
2...Rg8, then 3 Rd7+ mates, while 2...Jtb6 is weaker than the text move on ac-
count of 3 Rxb6 Rxb6 4 cxb6 Sb8 5 Sxa5 and White goes on to win Black's e- pawn.
3 Rd5+ Ng7 4 Sxd6 Be8 5 Se6 Sxc5 6 Bb7+ 1-0
The role of the files in the attack on the castled king Of all the long-range actions, the most important in attacking the castled king is the vertical one on the open file. It is important because it is easier to 'clear' a file Although 2 Rb7, and only then 3 £ft a6, wins a piece for nothing. Ranks, files and diagonals in the attack on the castled king 153 than a rank, and it is useful because being placed on an open file is 'the best way for a rook to be employed'. There are four ways of establishing a rook (or queen) on an open (or half- open) file: 1 ) the file is already open from one end to the other or to an opposing piece and all that is needed is for the rook to be brought on to it. 2) the rook is posted in front of one of its own pawns (e.g. the king's rook is manoeuvred via el and e3 to h3 in front of the pawn on h2). 3) the pawn in front of the rook advances and is sacrificed to open up the file. 4) the pawn in front of the rook leaves the file by making a capture. The further operations of the rooks on the file are similar to those which take place when control is assumed of any line (constructing outposts, clearing, cap- turing pieces, squares, and focal-points, etc.). As a first general example of the part played by the files in an attack on the cas- tled king, let us examine a famous game of Rubinstein's. R Johner - Rubinstein Teplitz-Schonau, 1922 Queen's Gambit Declined
1 d4 d5 2 c4 e6 3 2Bf3 a6
Modem theory does not rate this move very highly. White obtains a sound and useful position by exchanging on d5. The normal and objectively best course for White here is to prepare a so-called minority attack, e.g. after castling kingside and playing Habl he advances his pawns to b4 and a4, continuing with b5 and bxc6 in order to weaken Black's pawn formation. Another way is to play on Black's weaknesses at c5 and b6 after exchanging the dark-squared bishops. Johner, a player with an incisive style, does not fancy these positional schemes and chooses a third way: castling on the opposite side and making an attack on the castled king, which is not a bad plan, but allows Black equal chances.
9..Bxf6 10 Rc2
After eliminating Black's knight at f6, White induces a weakening of Black's castled position.
10...h6 11 O-O-O
First 11 h3 would have been better, and only then O-O-O, with the further plan of Sdgl, g4, h4 etc. The text move permits Black to divert White's g-pawn from
154 The Art of Attack in Chess
its file by playing ,.. .g4 and ...Bxf3, after which the danger of the thrust g5 is averted.
12 h3 jLxf3 13 gxf3 (D)
Admittedly, White now has an open g-file, but Black is not weak on this file, since the g7-square is excellently covered. Here the g-file is of less value than the possibility of g4-g5, which White enjoyed before the exchange on f3. If Black's pieces had been differently arranged, the opening of the g-file might have been a good thing, but as it is Black's weakness is at h6, not g7; the result is that the opening of the file has considerably blunted White's potential attack on the kingside. This instructive point should be remembered, since similar positions often occur in practice.
13...a5?
The great Akiba is dozing at this point, and is not far from falling into an infe- rior position. The move 13...a5? did not appeal to Griinfeld or Becker, the consci- entious authors of the tournament book, though they missed the essential point of the situation and recommended 13...£ki7, which is equally weak. The position can be briefly summed up as follows: gxf3 has undoubtedly blunted the direct attack on the castled king, but it has given an added sharpness to the central position, where White threatens e4-e5 (naturally, after strengthen- ing d4 by means of £}e2 and perhaps ,Nf5). If White manages to play e5, a turn- ing-point in the situation is reached and White, on the basis of his power in the centre and his expulsion of the bishop from f6, obtains a strong attack, in which the open g-file also comes in very useful. Turning-points of this kind can be very instructive. There still remains the question what Black ought to have played in order to prevent or hinder White's central advance. The answer is given by the following Ranks, files and diagonals in the attack on the castled king 155 analysis: 13...b6! 14 £jc2 Sa7 15 ?bl (after 15 e4 dxe4 White could not con- tinue with 16 fxe4 because of 16...Bxd4 while after 16 Bxe4 White would not be able to drive the enemy bishop away from f6; note also that since there was a threat of 15...c5, there is no time for further preparations, e.g. by 15 Bf5)
15...Hc7 16 jLf'5 c5! and Black has the better prospects; on 17 dxc5 he naturally
plays 17...bxc5, while if 17 Rd2, he makes the consistent reply 17...£}c6!, with- out having anything to fear from 18 dxc5 bxc5 19 Rxd5?, since by 19...Rb8 he can build up a powerful attack against White's king position. The essence of this analysis lies in Black opening up files by ...b6 and ...c5. We shall see how Black returns to this motif later on in the game and by opening up these files finally set- tles the issue. 14&bl More precise would be 14 £te2 immediately, but even against the move played it is too late for Black to play ...b6, etc., because he has lost a tempo by playing
13.. .a5?.

If White attempts to prepare e4 by 18 2d3, etc., Black has ...Sad8 to exert suf- ficient pressure on White's pawn at d4. For this reason White decides on an at- tack against the castled king with pieces alone, unaided by an aggressive central pawn formation, and as a result his prospects of success are not so great.

156 The Art of Attack in Chess
After a series of necessary defensive moves Black has begun preparing ...b6 and ...c5, and White realizes that he cannot endanger Black's position by opera- tions with his pieces down the flank without the support of his central pawns. Thus if 22 Nh5 b6 23 Rf5, which the commentators in the tournament book rec- ommended, Black simply plays 23...Re7 and finally carries out his threat with
24...c5. Thus White was correct to decide to centralize his knight on e5.
22...b6 23 f4 c5! (D)
Black gives up a pawn with the aim of opening up the b- and c-files and so pro- moting an attack on the castled king. The sacrifice is absolutely correct; White should have declined the poisonous gift and instead of 24 dxc5? played 24 £te5 !, in which case the position would have been approximately level. The official commentators showed that against the continuation 24...c4 White then has 25 Ra4 with the idea of playing 26 1ifb5; against this 25... b5 26 Rxb5 Eb6 (or
26...fib8) is of no avail because White thwarts all Black's designs with 27
£}xf7+. After 24 Be5 it would perhaps be best for Black to play 24...Sb8! 25 b3 Sc8, in which case White would have to defend himself with 26 Scl. At this point 26 b5 is no good because of 26...cxd4, while in the event of an attack by 26 Rc2 g8 27 Rf5 Black has an interesting counterattack based on a 'heavy barrage' along the c-file: 27...cxd4! 28 Nxf7!?

26...Bc8!
Black has two files on which to attack and he decides on the c-file, since then things move even more quickly than after 26...Eb8. Ranks, files and diagonals in the attack on the castled king 157

In this game and its notes we can see the various degrees of significance which open files can have. Firstly, there was White's open g-file, which was shown to be ineffective without support from another quarter; nevertheless, the notes pointed out its value as soon as White's pawn was advanced to e5. Then followed Black's manoeuvres to open up the b- and c-files, described firstly in the commentary and later actually put into practice at a critical stage of the game. Once the c-file had been opened by means of a sacrifice, the formidable power of the rooks on the file eventually brought the attacker victory. The attack along the h-file Using a rook to control an open h-file is one of the classic methods of attack after castling kingside, and so a number of examples will be devoted to it. Firstly, we have an instance of a rook exercising control from h3, in front of the h2-pawn.

A sacrifice of the bishop which might be termed 'semi-classic', this draws the king out to h7 so that the rook can get to h3 with gain of tempo; at the same time defence by ...h6 is excluded. It could also be put like this: the temporal factor here requires that the operation of 'clearing' h7 be carried out before posting the rook on the h-file.
1...6xh7 2 Sh3+ Ng8 3 Nxf6
White removes the bishop from f6 to allow his queen to move immediately to h4.
3... xf6 4 Rh4 Rc5+ 5 2f2 Nh5
Since the f-pawn is blocked, this is the only possible way of averting mate. 6 xh5 f6 7 g5 Rxd5 To stop the fatal thrust g6.

Next we have an example of a complex sacrificial combination based on an explosive opening of the h-file. White (P. Schmidt) mated Black (K. Richter) in spectacular style:

9Sxf7# This is also an instructive example with reference to weaving the mating net: White is the master of the h-file, but he still needs to deprive the black king of squares on the g-file. The most difficult to deal with is g5, but White solves that problem with his third and fourth moves. This example, from the game Toth-Szigeti, Budapest 1946, shows us an exe- cution of Anastasia's mate on the h-file.
1 Nxh7+ Nxh7 2 Sh3+ Ng8 3 Rh5 'h6
To all appearances Black has parried the attack on the h-file, but now comes the unexpected point. 4 2>f5! Rxh5 5 Ne7+ Nh7 6 Sxh5# One of the most important types of attack along the h-file is that which in- volves the doubling of the heavy pieces on the file, threatening mate at h8. If the enemy king's flight squares on the second rank are occupied by its own pawns, then the attacker must concentrate his effort on doubling his heavy pieces as rap- idly as possible and mate his opponent at the focal-point h8. However, if the king has a square to escape to or there is a threat to get one by moving the g-pawn or f- pawn, attention must be turned to this possible means of defence. The most eco- nomical formation against this, as far as the use of attacking material is con- cerned, is one with an assault pawn at g6 and a defending one at g7. The continuations from the following diagram are devoted to this typical formation (with colours reversed).
160 The Art of Attack in Chess
B
In this example Black is the attacker. He has already sacrificed his queen in or- der to reach this position, his intention being to mate White's king with a rook on hl. Doubling rooks is not a problem for Black in this position, but he is involved in a struggle for f2, which is important as a flight square for the white king. There are two methods of handling this: the king can be allowed to get out and a mating net then woven round it, or the formation with the pawn at g3 and doubled rooks can be set up. Both courses lead to success in this position, and both do so in two ways, so that in all Black has four lines which lead to victory. Here they are: A) l...Sah8 2 f4 The only reply; if 2 g3, White is mated by the rooks; if 2 f3, then 2...g3.
2...5M+
This is the 'mating net' method; 2...g3 allows White to reply 3 Rxh5. 3 sfcfZ Nxe4+ 4 el Sxfl+ 5 xfl Shl+ 6 jlgl Sxgl+ 7 &xgl Nf3+ 8 &fl 2"g3#. In this variation the doubled rooks have disappeared, but the 'doubled knights' are not to be overlooked. B) l...£"e2+ 2 Rxe2 Sah8 3 f4 g3 4 Rxh5 Nxe3+ 5 Sf2 Some players are more hurt by forced moves of this kind than by mate itself.
5... xh5 6 gxf2 7 Ne2 flW+ 8 xfl 2>g3+ 9 el Shi#
Let us now look at the two continuations which use the method based on the ...g3 formation. C) l...Ne2+ 2 Rxe2 Sah8 3 f4 Bxe3+ 4 Rxe3 xe4! This controls f2 and draws the queen away from the defence of g3.
5 Rxe4 g3
By means of a series of diversions Black has now established the necessary conditions for the success of the pure formation of doubled rooks plus pawn on g3 against pawn on g2. To avoid mate White would now have to give up nearly all Ranks, files and diagonals in the attack on the castled king 161 his material: 6 Re7+ <Nxe7 7 fiel+ *d?d7 8 &fl fihl+ 9 <Ne2 fie8+, after which
10...fiexel leads to a further harvest on the back rank.
D) l...fih7(D) Finally, there is also the possibility of the rook retiring from h5 so that the queen cannot take it after ...g3. 2f4 If 2 g3, we get the following entertaining variation: 2...Nf3+ 3 Rxf3 gxf3 4 Bg5 Nxe4 5 Jlh4 xg3! 6 .xg3 fiah8 mating. An example of 'clearing up' on the h-file .
2...g3 3 Sf3
Or 3 Wei Ne2+ 4 Rxe2 Sah8, etc.
3...fiah8 4 Sxg3 Shl+ 5 <Nf2 xe4#
In the above diagram doubling rooks was an easy task, but the crux lay in con- trolling the squares which the king might use for its escape. However, there are cases where the problem lies in actually doubling the rooks on the intended file. As a rule a necessary condition for this is that the attacker's back rank should be clear of other pieces so that the rooks can be moved at will. When the rooks on a given rank cover each other, they are said to be 'united'. Naturally, being 'united' can also apply to a queen and rook. The continuation from the following diagram is instructive in this context. There is no argument about Vuko vic's first three lines, but in variation 'D' White can play 2 .xd4 fiah8 (after 2 xd4 3 fie 1 fiah8 4 l4?f1 the king slips out) 3 Rxg4+! Nc7 4 Rh3 fixh3 5 gxh3 Nxd4 6 Nc3, escaping into an ending in which he is only slightly worse.
162 The Art of Attack in Chess
The diagram represents a critical stage in the game Krogius-Niemela, Lovisa 1934. White is in a precarious position, even though his pawn formation is sound and he has an open h-file. If he withdraws his bishop to c2, Black has the strong reply l...d4, while l...jLxg5 is also worth considering. If 1 Rg4 cxd3 2 Rh4 (2 Rh3 h5 3 gxh6 {3 g4 Bc8! } 3...d4! is in Black's favour) 2...h5 3 g4, Black plays
3...Ng7! 4 gxh5 Sh8 5 h6+ 7, and White's attack is beaten back. Black's de-
fensive plan against the idea of using the white g-pawn to break open the h-file is worth remembering, since there are often opportunities for such play in practice. Taking into account all the difficulties described, White decided to strike im- mediately with his rook at h7; Black failed to discover the correct reply.
1 Sxh7! cxd3?
It is true that Black could not take the rook because of 2 Rh5+ g8 3 Rh6 cxd3 4 ?f2, after which he has no satisfactory defence against Shi. However, it was also not a good idea to take the bishop; the precious tempo should have been expended on breaking up White's pawn formation, which is in fact the decisive factor in White's success on the h-file. Thus l...jtxg5! would have been correct. In that case two of White's pieces are threatened and if 2 f2, then Black can play 2...Nxh7; 2 Sh3 can be met by 2... .c8 and then ...Bh4+, while if 2 fxg5, then either 2...Rxg5 or 2...Nxh7. By sacrificing on g5 Black eliminates White's control of h6, and in some variations he captures with his queen on e5, thereby covering the square h8 in the manner of a fianchettoed bishop. 2 < f2! (D) Uniting the rooks on the back rank above all else! In fact, the chief value of this kind of move derives from the characteristic dual control which it provides. That is, by playing 2 Nf2! White opens up the square hl both for the queen and the al -rook, whereas after, for example, 2 Rg4? only the queen would be brought Ranks, files and diagonals in the attack on the castled king 163 into action and the al-rook would be left behind. The inadequacy of 2 Rg4? is shown by the following continuation: 2...'Nxh7 3 Rh4+ 'ifc'gS 4 sfcfZ f6! 5 e6 (if 5 exf6, Black plays 5... .xf6, enabling his king to wriggle out via f7) 5...fxg5 6 Rh6 Juf6 and Black has defended himself; e.g. if 7 Rxg6+ Ji.g 7 8 Shi, then
8...Bf6, while if 7 Shi, then 7 ...Re7 8 xg6+ Rg7, etc.
B
2...F6
If 2... xh7, then 3 hlH- Ng8 4 Rh6 leaves Black without a defence against
5 Shi (for 4...f6 is no good on account of 5 xg6+). The white queen must be
brought to h6, and it makes no difference whether it goes via hl or h4 (as both g4-h4-h6 and <Nf2, Whl-h6 take three tempi), but in the case of the al-rook, the continuation 2 f? ! is better than 2 Rg4?, which does nothing to bring it into action. Finally, it should be mentioned that a delayed sacrifice at g5 is also of no avail, e.g. 2...Nxg5 3 Whl Nf6 (or 3...f5 4 e6! ±f6 5 Rh6 Re8 6 Bhl and 7 Sh8+) 4 Rh6! followed by 5 Shi and 6 Eh8+.
3 Whl 1-0
For if 3...Re8 or 3...fxe5, then 4 h6 is decisive. The formation with rook on hi and pawn on h4 Of the various formations on the h-file the most important in practice is undoubt- edly that with a rook on hl and pawn on h4. It is a good representative example of battery attacks with rook and pawn which are created when the pawn captures an opposing piece and thereby opens up the file for the rook. This situation is often engineered by placing another attacking piece on the square covered by the pawn, creating threats which induce or oblige the opponent to take it. There are
164 The Art of Attack in Chess
two other methods of exploiting the formation of rook and pawn - one is to sim- ply advance the pawn, the other involves switching the rook on to another file (e.g. with rook on hl and pawns at h4 and g2, moving the rook to h3 and then to g3). Here are a few examples of these ideas. In this position we see a formation in which preparations have already been made for the opening of the h-file after the capture of the knight at g5. It is true that White, to move, currently has no very sharp threats, but he reckons correctly that he can quickly strengthen his position; in the meantime, he puts his trust in the efficacy of hxg5 if Black takes the knight.
1 c3 hxg5?
We shall examine this weak move in order to get to know the various typical combinations which occur when the h-file is opened in such circumstances. Cor- rect was 1...a5 !, stopping b4. White would then probably play 2 g4 to exclude the possibility of ... f6-h5-g3. Thus, the game could go on for a few more moves with the knight on g5 en prise, until the critical moment came to decide on the ex- act significance of the knight's position: either White's attack would break through, or Black would take the knight without any ill-effects to himself, or thirdly White might simply withdraw the knight from g5. 2 hxg5 £}xd5 3 Bxd5 Le6 If 3...g6, then 4 <Ne2!

This seems to provide the most resistance. If 4...g6, then 5 f5 Bxd5 6 f6 jle6 7 Rf3 and White can easily organize a mating attack. Ranks, files and diagonals in the attack on the castled king 165

1 Nf4 fxg5?
Black takes the bishop, even though there is no danger at the moment. He could have played, for example, 1...a6 2 Ncd5 b5 3 h5, after which there is a real threat of Ng6+. This can be parried by 3...h6, and if 4 Ng6+, then 4... h7 . 2 g6+! A typical method of 'clearing' the file before the battery opens fire with hxg5.

the g-file. In this case the rook is potentially active on two files at the same time and develops great power as a result. The above position arose in the game Vukovic-Dr Vajda, Debrecen 1925. Black had just threatened White's bishop by ...h6, and White replied: 1 114! If Black accepts the sacrifice, then after l...hxg5 2 hxg5 g6 3 gxf6 <?W6 4 White obtains an attacking position without having to surrender any material.
1...fie8 2 Nb7
Consistently refusing the gift offered him on g5, Black hopes to persuade the bishop eventually to retreat. However, he is in any case in a poor position, as a re- sult of his premature advance ...c4 earlier in the game. With his pawn on c5 Black would still have some say in the centre, and a central action is usually a valuable antidote against an attack on the castled king. With the pawn on c4, Black is only able to undertake slow operations on the queenside, and they are not sufficient to counterbalance White's attack. 3Sh3! A manoeuvre designed to bring the rook into the game as quickly as possible; it is characteristic of the formation with rook on hl and pawn on h4.

Black gives up a second pawn, but he can do nothing to save his position. After 8 hxg6 Nxe5 9 gxf7+ s xf7 10 dxe5 Ra5 White played 11 e4 and won in ten more moves, but the finish might have been even more abrupt with 11 Bxg7 xg7 12 g5 followed by h5. The h-file in connection with the classic bishop sacrifice The analysis of the classic bishop sacrifice, to which we devoted particular atten- tion in an earlier chapter, must now be supplemented by cases where such a sacri- fice is combined with an attack along the h-file. This arises when White has a rook on hl and pawn on h4, the pawn acting as a support for the knight on g5. We shall examine two examples from master chess in which the h-file is opened up. The following position comes from the game Steinitz-Golmayo, Havana 1888, and arose after the moves:
1 e4 e6 2 d4 d5 3 c3 Nf6 4 e5 fd7 5 f4 c5 6 dxc5 JLxcS 7 f3 O-O 8 Bd3
£k6? (D) Steinitz at this point played: 9h4 White could have played immediately 9 Bxh7+ < 'xh7 10 £}g5+ S gb 11 Rd3+ f5 and then 12 Rg3 Re8 (against other queen moves, 13 Rh4 is decisive) 13 xe6+ <6'f7 14 c7 Rd8 15 <?3xa8 when White has the upper hand.
1 In this line 14 xg7! Itg8 15 £}xe8 Hxg3 16 e6+ is decisive.
168 The Art of Attack in Chess
Steinitz rejected the idea of the sacrifice because on the twelfth move he had reckoned only on 12 Nxe6? Ra5 13 Nxf8+ Nxf8 14 Rxd5 Be6, which would indeed have been favourable for Black.
9...f6
White would have had a harder task after 9...h6, although even then he could have gained the advantage by 10 £}g5 . Given that this is a typical continuation, let us examine a few variations: 1) 10...hxg5 11 Bh7+! *xh7 12 Rh5+ <Ng8 13 hxg5 f5 14 g6 and mate. 2) 10...&dxe5 11 fxe5 Nxe5 12 Nh7+ <$h8 13 Nf4 Ng6 14 Nd2 and White is the better placed1. 3) 10...£fo4 1 1 Nh7+ *h8 12 Rh5 Re7 13 Nd2 f5 (if 13...Se8 then 14 i.g6 while against 13...£}c6 or other such moves White plays 14 O-O-O) 14 g6 Nxc2+ (also in White's favouris 14...Re8 15 £}xe6, etc.) 15 &dl Nxal 16 Bg8 ! followed by mate with the queen on h72.
1 This contention seems highly dubious. After 13...£k4, attacking b2 and threat-
ening 14...e5, White is clearly worse. Black has two central pawns for the piece, White's king is trapped in the centre and his pieces are hopelessly tangled up on the kingside. Therefore White should prefer 12 Nf3, with a double-edged posi- tion.
2 There is also a fair degree of wishful thinking in this line, for example after
14,..Re8 15&xe6 2>xc2+ 16 4?dl (16 Rxe6!) 16...Rxg6 17Nxg6 Nxal the queens are exchanged and White is a whole rook down. He can regain the exchange easily enough, but rounding up the al -knight is far from easy - the as- sessment must be that Black is better. All these lines illustrate the point that Vukovic himself makes: launching an attack without first completing your de- velopment is a risky business.

It is the formation with pawn on g6 against pawn on g7 (which has already been discussed) that is finally decisive.

9...c5 does nothing to stop it. Relatively best was 9...f5! 10 exf6 (after 10 e2 c5
1 1 c3 White is the better placed, but his attack is delayed and Black is not without counterplay) 10..Bxf6. The situation is then easier for Black, for as a result of the exchange on f6 an extremely important attacking unit has disappeared, namely White's pawn on e5. Sacrifices in this position are therefore not worth- while; after 1 1 Jtxh7+ xh7 12 Ng5+ Ng8 13 Rh5 Black has an adequate de- fence in 13...Rd7, while if 1 1 Ng5, he can play ll...Bxg5 12 hxg5 Rxg5! 13 Xxh7+ and White's attack is not worth much owing to his weakness in the centre and the activity of Black's queen, especially on the dark squares1. The last continuation can also be brought about by a different series of moves: 1 1 Ng5 Bxg5 12 Bxh7+, when Black should not play 12...Nxh7 (in which case 13 hxg5+ and 14 Rh5 is extremely strong) but 12... f8! 13 hxg5 Rxg5, ending with the position described above. These possibilities are worth getting to know well, since we are dealing with a typical position. Particularly important is the significance of Black's ...f5 in this kind of position: if White does not take the pawn at once en passant, the sacrifice on h7 is prevented directly; while if he takes it, then it is indirectly thwarted or at any rate made weaker, since White's pawn has disappeared from e5. It is also worth noting that to avert the sacrifice entirely by ...h6 or ...g6 is not a good thing in this position. If 9...h6, White plays 10 Ne2 followed by c3 and

attacks in a different way (e.g. by means of JLbl and Rd3 he forces a weakening of the square g6 or, alternatively, he plays g4, etc.); in this connection it is impor- tant to note that ...f5, if played later on, would create a new weakness on g6. If

These variations do not exhaust the possibilities of the position, but they give a good illustration of the strength of White's game after 16 dxc5.
B
16...a6?
An example of the inadequacy of passive defence. 17 Nb5, which is what Black was afraid of, is by no means White's principal threat and is only effective in conjunction with a strong initiative. Alekhine is also at fault in his commen- tary when he claims that Nb5 represented a threat after 16 O-O-O. Instead of 16...a6? Black should have played 16...cxd4! and thus exploited the extra tempo in the centre, e.g.: 1) 17 Nb5 Nc6 and now: la) 18 f4 Sxf7 19 £}d6 and now Black has a satisfactory defence in l .WfS!1.

In the past commentators used to end their work on games like this by praising the winner, but does not the loser in some way deserve credit too? Is it not he who
1 Not so, as White wins by 20 Rg5+ Nd7 21 Nxf7 Rxf7 22 fih7 and the g7-pawn
falls. Ranks, files and diagonals in the attack on the castled king 175 'fulfils the ardent desires' of the attacker, as is done in this case by the good- natured matador from Ultima Thule...? Diagonals in the attack on the castled king Tartakower thought it suitable to bestow epithets of the following kind on the files: a-file - positional; b - covetous; c - far-sighted; d - prosaic; e - dangerous; f - tempting; g - sacrificial; and h - contentious. He might also have invented something similar (even if he in fact did not) to apply to the ranks. But the diago- nals? Well, they are all somehow equally 'elegant, subtle, far-sighted', etc. On the long diagonals (al-h8 and a8-hl) more kings have already died than in the whole of the world's history; more tragedies have been played out on the classic diagonals (bl -h7 for White and b8-h2 for Black) than in all the world's theatres, and on the developing diagonals (a2-g8 and a7-gl respectively) there have been more mistakes made than in a large library full of books. Now that we have started on nicknames and epithets, let us bestow on the diagonals a4-e8 and h4- d8 (from White's point of view; a5-el and h5-dl from Black's) the name of pin- ning diagonals. The reader can think over for himself how much material he has already lost on them. Just as the rook is the piece suited for play on open files and ranks, so the bishop is the master of the diagonals, indeed they are his raison d'etre. At all stages of the game, and especially in an attack on the castled king, marshalling bishops on the diagonals demands great skill. A player's skill, in fact, is often demonstrated by his play on the diagonals, and the impression is then given that 'the slender bishop is subtler than the stout rook'. Putting facetiousness aside, let us now look at the relationship between the lines commanded by the rook and the bishop's diagonals. In the first place, it should be stressed that the fundamental difference does not lie in the number or importance of the squares on the files or diagonals, nor in the weight of operations on them. The differences arise only from the different val- ues of rook and bishop and also from the part played by pawn moves in opening up or blocking a line. It is harder to sacrifice the more valuable rook than the bishop, and the order of value is even more relevant when it comes to pinning: exchanging a bishop for a pinned rook wins the exchange, while bishop for knight is tit-for-tat, but a rook can only gain from pinning a piece when it takes the queen. The other difference is still more explicit: it is comparatively easy to open up or close a diagonal by the normal advance of one's pawns, but achieving the same object on a file means that the pawn has to make a capture, and this naturally depends on the disposition
176 The Art of Attack in Chess
of one's opponent's pieces; hence, there may be considerable difficulty in open- ing up a file. If, on the other hand, it has to be closed, an outpost as a rule has to be established; on the diagonals, however, outposts are the exception, since the 'open-shut' game is easily carried out by the pawns. It is in this, ultimately, that the whole 'subtlety and far-sightedness' of the diagonal lies. We shall open a se- ries of examples with a case of pinning on a diagonal. The pinning here is in fact a temporary episode within the whole operation of 'clearing up' on the diagonal, and the end comes with the line being completely breached when the pinned piece is captured. This position comes from the game Tolush-Renter, Estonian Championship
1945. It is White to move.
1 Nxg7
This draws Black's king out to g7 and at the same time opens up the diagonal of the white bishop on b2. I...Nxg7 2 Sdl Re7 If2...Re6, then 3 f5. 3 g4+ #h8 4 fid7 In this way White wins the enemy bishop, but the correct method of exploiting the position would have been to aim consistently for a breakthrough on the square f6, e.g. 4 WgS Nc6 5 f5 Sg8 (or 5...Sd8 6 fiel and if 6...Sdd6, then 7 Rh6 followed by Sf4 wins; otherwise the manoeuvre Sf4-g4 is at once decisive1) 6 W16 Bc8 7 h4 b5 (Black has no better move; for example, ...Hg7 and ...£te8 will not save him because of f6) 8 h5 a5 9 Sfd2 b4 (the combination which White has
1 Black might defend by 6...2dd6 7 Rh6 Rd8, and if 8 fif4 then 8...Hd1. In view
of the uncertainties of this approach, Tolush's method appears sounder. Ranks, files and diagonals in the attack on the castled king 177 prepared by advancing his h-pawn to h5 is also decisive against other moves) 10 Sd6 Sxd6 11 Sxd6 Rxd6 12 Bxf6+ Rxf6 13 Rxf6+ Sg7 14 h6 and White mates. 4,..Re6 5 Rg5 Sc6 6 Sxb7 and White won in due course. An important point is that, in addition to 'clearing' one's opponent's pieces from a diagonal, cases also occur where one's own pieces prevent it being opened. It is extremely difficult to resuscitate a diagonal on which one has a blocked pawn of one's own. Structurally, it is a similar problem to that of opening a file where a pawn blocks the path of a rook, and it is usually solved in the same way, i.e. by sacrificing a piece on a square controlled by the pawn. Here is an ex- ample. This position occurred in the game Alexander-Szabo, Hil versum 1947. White pitched his knight into f6 with check so as to bring the long diagonal back to life. 1 2tf6+! gxf6 If l... ?h8, then 2 Rh4 is very strong1.
2 Rg3+ s£?h8 3 exf6 jlxf6 4 Ne5!
White threatens 5 Sxf6, 5 £}xf7+ and indeed 5 Rh4 (5... .xh4 6 Nxf7+ and 7 <2)h6#. Black no longer has any defence.
4..Jtxe5 5 Nxe5+ f6 6 Sxf6 1-0
Since if 6...fixf6, 7 Sfl is decisive. The 'clearing' of the long diagonal was a victory for the bishop. 1 2 Rh4 allows the defence 2...Rxd3. Instead, 2 Re4 is correct, when 2...gxf6 3 exf6 followed by <$3g5 forces mate.
178 The Art of Attack in Chess
As far as play on the diagonals is concerned, the strength of the central squares on the given diagonals is particularly important. These squares can assist the at- tacker in setting up outposts, in transferring pieces, and in other operations. Thus one should, as a rule, aim to have such squares protected or even over-protected. This is one of the maxims of positional play, and we shall see in the next example how Black pays for ignoring this maxim and how the attack on the castled king suddenly erupts. This position arose in Stoltz-Guimard, Groningen 1946. White played: 1 dxc5 £}xc5? A mistake, since it surrenders to White control over the important central squares d4 and e5, which means that the long diagonal occupied by his bishop on b2 is already as good as opened up (considering the gain of tempo by £}b5, which White always has in hand). Black should have played either l...bxc5 or 1 xc5. 2 <Nb5 Rd8
2...Rb8 is not good here because of White's grip on e5, e.g. 3 .e5 Ra8 4
<2k7, and Black loses the exchange. 3 xa7 Black will, it is true, win back the a-pawn, but White will have succeeded, without loss of time, in strengthening the position of his knight at b5 (...a6 is no longer possible).
3...2a8 4 Nb5 Exa2 5 Wbl Sa8 6 Ng5
Suddenly the course of the game turns against Black's castled position; White threatens Jtxf6 followed by mate on h7.
6.. .h6?
Black should have consented to a further weakening of the diagonal by 6...g6, for that would have meant less trouble for him than the text move . Ranks, files and diagonals in the attack on the castled king 179
7 Nxf6 hxg5 8 Be5
By threatening $Lcl, White installs his bishop with gain of tempo at e5, a square that is now firmly under his control. His next intention is to play Rb2, af- ter which the bishop's whole manoeuvre takes on the purpose of clearing the di- agonal.
8... c8 9 Rb2 dxc4
If 9...f6, which the tournament book (by Euwe and Kmoch) considers correct, White wins a pawn: 10 .d6 Se8 (or 10...Rd7 11 $Lcl 2a6 12 Bf3, etc.) 11 Jtxe7 Sxe7 12 £ki6 Rc6 13 Nxb7 Sxb7 14 cxd5 exd5 15 2xd5, and Black is in difficulties on a fresh diagonal (a2-g8).
10 Bxc4
Not 10 Bxg7? because of 10...Rc6.
10...Rc6 11 f3 (D)
The tournament book gives this a question mark and suggests 1 l...f6; how- ever, after 12 Bd6 Sfe8 13 b4 a4 14 Rb3 Nh8 15 Bxe7 Black loses his e- pawn. 12 )d4 Making use of the other square Black surrendered with l...Nxc5?. White has now created a battery consisting of queen and knight.
12...Rb7 13 Bxa6 Sxa6 14 .xg7!
The various operations on the diagonal are concluded by a bishop sacrifice, the aim of which is to lure the king into the line of fire. Black did not submit to 1 6...#tee4 is perhaps the most sensible. Black blocks the bl-h7 diagonal without creating a further weakness on the kingside.

this and played 14..J2fa8, losing after a further sixteen moves. However, we are only interested in the continuation 14...'4>xg7, which is followed by 15 Nxe6+ g6 16 Rg7+ f5 17 £}d4#. The plan also works with 15 £}f5+, in which case mate is achieved by 17 g4#. The next example is devoted to the problem of recognizing strong diagonals and combining their 'clearing' with an effective use of the bishop. Here we have a position from the game Lundin -Tartakower, Groningen 1946. It is clear that White is the better placed, and that Black is weak on the a2-g8 di- agonal, but it is less obvious that the white bishop will put in such a quick appear- ance on that diagonal and that the game will be decided on the bl-h7 diagonal. White won as follows: 1 e4! fxe4 Otherwise e5 is too strong.
2 Ng5 Sxfl+ 3 JLxfl!
The bishop is on its way to c4, the knight on g5 is already casting glances in the direction of f7, and the threats on the e-file see to it that the initiative remains in White's hands.
3...Rg6 4 d6
This opens the diagonal with gain of tempo (the threat is Rd5+ and then Rxb7).

Black lost the exchange and the game a few moves later. Here is an example showing the strength of two bishops working together. White offers a pawn in order to open up the long diagonal for his b2-bishop. 1 d5! d7 Black does not accept the sacrifice. After l...exd5 2 Sxe8 Rxe8 3 Ng5 both

4...g6 is met by 5 Rc3, while if 4...h6, then 5 Bh7+ h8 6 Nh4.
5 Bxh7+ Nh8 6 gxf3
Having gained a pawn and weakened Black's position, White won the game in ten more moves.
182 The Art of Attack in Chess
In this position, which arose in Geller-Kotov, USSR Championship (Moscow) 1955, White sacrificed a pawn to obtain control of the long diagonal and thereby gain the possibility to break through with a winning attack. 16 b3! <Nb4 17 £bl Nxe4? Black accepts the pawn sacrifice, a decision which not only costs him a series of tempi but also causes him to yield control of the long diagonal to White.

8 Pieces and pawns in the attack
on the castled king Our examination of the attack on the castled king has so far (in chapters 4-7) been mainly directed towards the spatial aspect of the attack, and it is now time to ex- amine the parts played by particular pieces and the significance of material sacri- fices. Some of these points have already been touched on, so in this chapter we shall concern ourselves only with certain themes where the material aspect is paramount and which have not yet been fully dealt with. The queen in the attack on the castled king The queen is undoubtedly the most important piece in the attack on the castled king, and indeed without it such an attack rarely comes into consideration. Ad- mittedly, it is not impossible to undertake a direct attack without the queen, but the necessary conditions for it cannot easily be created. The queen's great mobility, its main characteristic, is a useful factor in the at- tack on the castled king, but its effectiveness at short range is even more striking. If it is in occupation of the focal-point g7, the enemy king on g8 has every square taken from it; moreover, if it is protected on that focal-point and the focal-point itself has been cleared of the influence of the opposing pieces, then the king is mated. The queen is, as it were, 'made for focal-points', and particularly for play on compound focal-points. Therefore, the queen's chief strategy in an attack on the castled king consists in playing on the focal-points and discovering ways in which to attack as effectively as possible at close range. Thus the queen, which in an endgame on an open board feels such an aversion towards the opponent's king that it will not allow it nearer than two paces away, is filled in attack with some kind of dark desire and dreams only of how it can steal into the castled dwelling and there fold the king in a close and deadly embrace. The reverse side of the queen's positive characteristics is its great material value; this means that the queen is not lightly sacrificed and is not as a rule given up for smaller gains, such as preventing castling or clearing a focal-point. How- ever, there are a number of different kinds of queen sacrifice which occur in the attack on the castled king; these can be reduced in the main to two fairly sharply differentiated types: the case where the sacrifice forces mate, 'check upon
184 The Art of Attack in Chess
check' , as it were, and the case where it produces a great positional weakness on the opposing side. There are also unusual and curious queen sacrifices; we shall give three exam- ples as variations on this theme, ranging over a period of 40 years. In this position, from the game Fox-Bauer, Washington 1901, White, to move, set his opponent a trap.
1 Ndc4 dxc4?
Black in his greed accepted the sacrifice, which he should have refused. 2 xg6! A correct sacrifice of the queen, which forces the opening of either the h-file or the a2-g8 diagonal.
2...hxg6
Or 2...fxg6 3 Jlxc4+ <Nf8 4 Nxg6+ and 5 Sh8#.
3 Nxg6 fxg6 4 .xc4+ fS 5 5h8#
Pieces and pawns in the attack on the castled king 185 A position from the game Lewitzky-Marshall, Breslau 1912. Marshall won re- nown in the following way:
1...5h6 2 Rg5 Hxh3 3 Sc5
White saw that 3 gxh3 would not do because of 3...£rf3+ and intended, on
3...Ra3, to play 4 Sc7, etc1.
However, Black took him by surprise with:
3...Rg3I! 0-1
4 hxg3 Ne2# and 4 fxg3 £te2+ 5 ?h1 Sxfl# fail at once, while after 4 Rxg3 £te2+ 5 s£?h1 Nxg3+ 6 <&gl Nxfl 7 gxh3 £k!2 White is left a knight down. This position is from a blindfold game of Alekhine's at Tenerife in 1945 (Alekhine-Supico) and acts as a counterpart to Marshall's combination above. Alekhine, in playing lWg6! forced Black to resign (1-0). If Black does not take the queen but plays instead l...Sg8, White wins by 2 Rxh7+ and 3 Sh3#; if Black plays l...hxg6 the rook mates immediately, while if l...fxg6, then 2 £}xg6+, and again the rook mates on h3. Lovers of curiosities will have noticed the common square (g6 or g3) on which the queen is sacrificed on all three occasions. The curious side of these examples should not distract one from noticing what is typical in them: in all these cases the attacker has a number of other pieces at his disposal, all in the strongest ag- gressive positions, while only his queen is somehow 'underemployed'. As a re- sult, it is given the task of breaking up the position by sacrificing itself. The situation is that although the pieces are in very aggressive positions, they cannot
1 Although even this fails after 4... e2+ 5 &hl fixh2+ 6 <3?xh2 Rd6+, etc.
186 The Art of Attack in Chess
settle the issue by themselves since, if they are sacrificed, their aggressive forma- tion also disappears. It is therefore left to a less committed piece to carry out the work of destruction, and in these cases this is none other than the queen. Usually, however, the reverse applies: the other pieces are sacrificed, while the queen reaps the harvest. The heavy pieces in the attack The examples in chapters 4-7 have shown us various kinds of operations on the part of the rook, the bishop, and the knight on lines and focal-points, and no fur- ther illustrations of the use of these pieces in an attack on the castled king need be given. Only one special case remains to be dealt with, and that is the attack on the castled king carried out by the heavy pieces (queen and rooks) alone. The main feature of this kind of attack can be summed up as the task of overcoming the clumsiness of the rooks. The attacker must aim to make his own rooks active and force his opponent's into passivity. A rook's mobility depends essentially on its ability to switch its control suddenly from one file to another and, in particular, from a file to a rank. Or, in the terminology used in my Introduction to chess (2nd ed., p. 171), the rook must have corresponding strong squares at its disposal. Here are a few examples: This position is from the game Winter-Capablanca, Ramsgate 1929. Black, to move, played: l...Bh8 Black threatens 2...g5, which would not have been good at once because of 2 Sg2. White is now obliged to weaken his pawn position by moving his h-pawn.

9 Sxf8+ and White mates.

It is patently clear that Black's rooks are active and White's passive.

2 exf4 is no better, since Black can continue 2...Rh4 with the double threat of
3...Sxg2+ and 3...Rxh3.

Black compels the king to go to hl so that he can play ...Rg3 with gain of tempo on the sixth move !

c8 instead of b7. The analysis has been modified to take account of this correc- tion.
188 The Art of Attack in Chess
4 &hl Rg7 5 Rd4 Na6! 6 Ef2 Rg3! 7 Zc2 ixfl 8 Exfl Eac8 By threatening to break through at c4, Black gains a tempo for doubling rooks. Alekhine now uses his heavy pieces to force home the final attack.
9 b3 Bc7 10 Be2 Scg7 11 Sf4 Sg6! (D)
Black threatens ...Sh6, ...Exh3+ and ...Wgl#. If White plays 12 Efl, the plan of 12...Eh6 followed by sacrificing at h3 is again in order, for the rook on fl is unprotected; moreover, if it is moved (e.g. to al) then 13...Exh3+ still succeeds because the queen can follow up with a decisive check at f3. In his book, My Best Games of Chess 1924-1937, Alekhine mentions another reply, 12 Wdl, and claims that 12...Eh6 leads to an original zugzwang position; this is not correct (because Black has the strong threat of 13...Rg7 14 Rd4 Exh3+, etc.), but it is true inasmuch as White's rooks cannot move; they provide a perfect illustration of 'the rook's clumsiness'. After 12 Wdl Sh6 White would have to play 13 Wai (not 13 c4 because of
13...d4!), in which case the strongest reply is 13...a6! (creating another threat, i.e.
...b5-b4 followed by ...d4; if 13...Rg7, then 14 c4 is possible). Now White's front e-pawn is lost, but he can still offer some resistance by 14 Sfl. Black, however, must not take the e-pawn while White's queen is on al; he does better with
14...b5 15 axb5 axb5, after which one can speak of a type of zugzwang position,
since White cannot prevent the situation of his pawn on e5 from deteriorating still further. If 16 b4 (or 16 Wdl or 16 Wei), Black takes the pawn on e5, after which he should win. In the actual game White gave up a pawn in a different way and lost as follows:
12 Rb4?I Sh6 13 h4 Rg7! (D)
Stronger than the prosaic 13...Sxh4+. The black queen retires and at the same time creates the threat of ...Sg6, a typical case of a tripled formation with a rook Pieces and pawns in the attack on the castled king 189 in front of the queen. The reader should note the mobility of Black's heavy pieces, which allows such rapid and useful regroupings to be made. In the course of the game and its variations up to this point two pairs of corresponding strong squares for Black stand out, namely, g6 and h6 for the rook, and g3 and g7 for the queen.
14 c4 Sg6 15 W2 fig3!

The sacrifice in the attack on the castled king Before we turn to the role of the pawns in the attack on the castled king, a few general remarks must be made about sacrifices in the castling area. Certain combinative elements are present in the case of every sacrifice, though these sac- rifices may be of widely diverging types. However, the typical sacrifice in the castling area is the one which is closely influenced by the special characteristics of that area, namely the castled king and the pawns in front of it. The typical sac- rifice either changes the structure of the pawns, or aims to draw the king on to a square where it can be attacked, or else helps to create a focal-point. We have al- ready met examples of the last two types in the course of discussing focal-points, particularly in the case of the classic bishop sacrifice. Here our principal interest is the pawn structure and the possibility of altering it by means of a sacrifice. A sacrifice can either simply annihilate one of the pawns in front of the king, or it can deflect the pawn on to another file, or finally it can cause it to be blocked. The main use of the sacrifice in the attack on the castled king is to eliminate the pawns in the castling area, and a number of examples will be devoted to this. But first of all, let us examine two examples where the emphasis is on spoiling the pawn structure by deflecting or blocking the pawns. This position comes from an analysis of the game Capablanca-Nimzowitsch, Bad Kissingen, 1928. White mates as follows: Pieces and pawns in the attack on the castled king 191

Deflecting the pawn from f6. 2 f6! Blocking the f7-pawn.

and Black has no way of stopping mate on h7. White here overcame the resistance of Black's f-pawn on the diagonal bl-h7 by making sacrifices which deflected one pawn and blocked the other. This position arose in the game Steinitz-L. Paulsen, Baden-Baden 1870. It is White's move, and he is faced with the task of finding the most effective attack- ing plan against Black's castled position. To this end he played: 1 b6! White gives up a pawn in order to weaken Black's castled position and open up the a- and b-files. This kind of pawn sacrifice is instructive and typical. Its ad- vantage lies in the fact that Black has no way of blocking the pawn structure but is forced to capture in order to avoid getting into worse difficulties. I...axb6 2 2xf6! The castled position has been effectively weakened and the situation is ripe for the further thrust a5, that being the logical method of following up 1 b6 !, but Steinitz sees that, before playing a5, he can strengthen his attack still further by sacrificing the exchange.

One further remark must be made before passing on to the destructive sacri- fice: a sacrifice and the operations following it must have the aim of creating a fo- cal-point, especially if the opponent has some active counterplay at his disposal. The next diagram shows an example where the attacker wrecks his opponent's castled position and regains the material he has sacrificed, but is still unsuccess- ful because he cannot create a focal-point. This position is from the game Colle-Tartakower, Niendorf 1927. White is ex- cellently placed here and ought to continue with 1 Nh3, but Colle, the lover of sacrifices, cannot resist the temptation and offers material in a position which is still insufficiently prepared. 1 exf7? Sxf7 2 £sxe6 Rc8 3 Ng6 8 4 i.xf7+ Nxf7 5 Nxg7 All these captures have been made on different squares, none of which quali- fies as a candidate for a focal-point. No wonder that Black develops a counterat- tack that ensures sufficient counterplay.

Pieces and pawns in the attack on the castled king 193 The destructive sacrifice We have already referred to the annihilation of the pawns in front of the castled king as the most important or at any rate predominant result of sacrificial opera- tions. It would be more exact to say that the destruction of these pawns is the most common combinative element of sacrifices in the castling area. Most play- ers tend to pay more attention to the material aspect than to the temporal one, but the most decisive consequence of the destruction of pawns is that the departed pawns can no longer affect the game. This is a permanent positional factor by means of which many combinations are sustained, even when all may not have been in order on the temporal side. It is very important to spot the opportunities for making a destructive sacrifice, and in many positions the attacker is shown the way by simply calculating what would happen if his opponent were not to have a certain pawn. We shall look at a number of examples which illustrate typical destructive sac- rifices. This position arose in a match game between Loyd and Delmar in 1879. It is Black's move, and he must act quickly if White is not to break through by b6 or Sxa7. Various attempts like ...Hg5+ or ...Sh5 meet with resistance, and only the immediate capture of the pawn at h2 ensures mate. 1 xh2+! 2 <Nxh2 Sg5+ 3 <Ng4 Eh5 4 2Bh2 Rxh2+ 5 £fl Se5 and mate by ...Whl# is unavoidable. The destructive sacrifice on g7 (or g2) is particularly dangerous, and we shall examine one out of the rich collection of this type.

This position arose in the game Shumov-Jaenisch, St. Petersburg 1849. Black, to move, concluded the game as follows: l...Nxg2+ 2 xg2 Rg6+ 3 &hl Jtd5+ 4 f3 Bxf3+ 5 Sxf3 Wgl# We shall now go on to look at cases of successive sacrifices, whereby two of the pawns in front of the castled king are eliminated. It is often easy to spot sacri- fices of this kind if the position is looked at in the light of our thematic criterion: what would the situation be if the pawns were not there? Let us take the next dia- gram, for example. In this position, from the game Keller-Rohaczek, Vienna 1937, it is White's move, and he has an easy task if he imagines Black's position without the pawns on h7 and g7 and realizes that White then mates with his queen on h5 and rook on gl. The operation is then extremely simple.

Pieces and pawns in the attack on the castled king 195 This position is from a correspondence game between Luprecht and Schulz played in the United States in 1946. Here it is a question of removing Black's pawns on a7 and b7 from in front of the king. If these pawns did not exist, a build-up with a rook on bl and a queen on e3 would give White an irresistible mating attack. The solution is therefore simple. 1 ±xa7+ Nxa7 2 Re3+ First, the queen is brought nearer with gain of tempo and then the second pawn is annihilated.

Prize at the Saltsjbbaden Interzonal tournament in 1948. In the above position, White continued: 1 fxg7! This eliminates the pawn on g7 (in this case the sacrifice does not take place on that square but indirectly at f4). Black accepts the sacrifice in order not to be left a pawn down.

Black has three minor pieces for a rook and two pawns, but his knights are badly placed, whereas the position is just right for White's rooks. With 5...Rf6, Black attempts to lessen the force of the attack by returning some material, but he is unsuccessful because his knights continue to find them- selves on awkward squares. Other lines were no better, e.g.: 1) 5...Nd4 6 cxd4 cxd4 7 Sfel !

Pieces and pawns in the attack on the castled king 197 Of the various sacrificial devices to eliminate two pawns in front of the castled king, the sacrifice of both bishops on h7 and g7 is particularly worth noting. One of the oldest examples of this occurred in the game Lasker-Bauer, Amsterdam
1889. The opening moves were:
1 f4 d5 2 e3 Nf6 3 b3 e6 4 Nb2 Ae7 5 Nd3 b6 6 Nc3 Nb7 7 f3 bd7 8 O-O
O-O 9 Ne2 c5 10 Ng3 Rc7 11 Ne5 Nxe5 12 Axe5 Rc6 13 Re2 a6? (D) In this position, after Black's mistaken last move, Lasker worked out a combi- nation which involved the sacrifice of both bishops; to this end he first of all forced the deflection of Black's knight.

The pawns in the attack on the castled king These examples of destructive sacrifices have shown us a procedure for dealing with the opponent's pawns, and now we shall examine the part played by the at- tacker's pawns in the attack on the castled king. The part is a very varied one, re- flecting, as it does, the rich possibilities inherent in the pawn's movements. The pawns are, above all, the pieces which cost one the least to sacrifice in one's ef- forts to weaken the enemy position; they are also excellent at harrying one's op- ponent's pieces as well as helping to support one's own on focal-points or strong
200 The Art of Attack in Chess
squares. In all these cases the positive characteristics of the pawn are to the fore. The other side to the use of pawns in an attack on the castled king is a logical con- sequence of their negative characteristics, namely their limited mobility and the impossibility of reversing their moves. The attacker's pawn needs, on average, three moves before it can have a direct effect on the opposing castling area itself; also, the attacker cannot transfer it from one file to another at will, but only when opposing units are so placed as to come into its line of fire. Equally inconvenient is the other aspect of the pawn's negative characteristics: in advancing, it weak- ens the squares which it leaves behind it, and if the attack does not succeed, seri- ous positional weaknesses may become evident in the attacker's position. The irreversibility of pawn moves may also lead to a general blockade, which in turn produces a rigid position and complicates the attack. However, the pawn still has one more positive characteristic which can on some occasions help the attacker: the promotion of the pawn into a piece on the opponent's back rank may be the attacker's last trump at the critical stage of an attack. Thus all the different aspects of the pawn's special characteristics find their expression in an attack on the castled king, and the picture becomes still more varied when we fill in the spatial side of pawn operations in this kind of attack. Here is a brief summary of a pawn's role in the attack on the castled king. 1) The attacker's pawn (with or without a sacrifice) forces the opponent to weaken his castled position. 2) It serves to create combinative elements in attack (e.g. by deflecting or at- tracting the opponent's pieces or opening up files). 3) It forms part of an attacking formation (e.g. in the formation with a rook on hl and a pawn on h4 or as a support to a piece on a focal -point). 4) A particular example of such an attacking formation which should be men- tioned is the pawn centre; as a rule, this serves either generally to confine the op- ponent or to provide the basis for an attack on the castled king. 5) The pawn advances independently on the flank in order to drive an enemy piece away or to take control of a square. An advance of this kind is usually called a bayonet attack. 6) Two or three attacking wing pawns advance against the opponent's castled position in a frontal formation (a pawn avalanche or roller). 7) The pawn moves up into the castling area as a straightforward attacking unit against the enemy king. 8) The pawn advances into the castling area (with or without an attack on the king) in order to be promoted, after which it can carry on the attack in its new role. These various types of action are usually interrelated in practical play, and sin- gle moves often combine two or more such functions. Indeed, when the process Pieces and pawns in the attack on the castled king 201 is observed as a whole over the space of a few moves, the continuous transition from one type to another is virtually the rule, except in the case of point 4 (centre pawns). As an example of the kind of progressive changes which can take place in the role of a pawn attack let us look schematically at 'the career of an h-pawn*, move by move. h3: the pawn advances and drives an opposing piece from g4. This could be termed a Tittle bayonet' (cf. point 5); h4: it makes up a set formation in conjunction with a rook on hl (point 3); this is followed by g4, and we have a frontal formation (point 6); h5: it threatens to open up the h-file by capturing an enemy pawn at g6 (poten- tially under point 2); Black therefore counters by blocking the position with ...g5, but as a result weakens the pawn structure in front of his king (point 1); h6: it acts as a support for an attack against the focal-point g7 (point 3); h7+: Black has warded off the threats on g7, but now the pawn turns to direct attack (point 7); h8Q: the pawn promotes to a queen and carries on the attack (point 8). Every chess player will admit that such a career on the part of an h-pawn is in no way exceptional but is, on the contrary, a typical illustration of the many- sidedness of a pawn's role in an attack on the castled king. Examples have already been given of the aspects of a pawn's activity listed un- der points 1-3 and 7-8, so we shall restrict ourselves in this chapter to a survey of those under points 4-6. The role of the pawn centre The centre pawns have the task of controlling important squares and preventing the opposing forces from using them. As a result the pawn centre is the main weapon in the struggle for an advantage in development and space. However, in addition to the general positional function of restricting the opponent, the pawn centre also acts as a basis for an attack on the castled king. Firstly, the overall re- striction imposed on the opponent makes it difficult for him to deploy his pieces and so indirectly assists the attacker's plans; in addition, each of the centre pawns directly controls the outer squares of the castled position. Thus, on e5, the e- pawn controls the important square f6, and on e6, the square f7; a similar control is exercised against the queenside castling position by the d-pawn (the squares c6 and c7). We have already seen a number of fine examples of the influence of a centre pawn in an attack on the castled king, and especially the part played by the pawn on e5 in the classic bishop sacrifice. In this section we shall examine the more
202 The Art of Attack in Chess
general situation, where a central formation has the functions both of a restricting agent and also of a direct controller of squares in the castling area. From the pro- fusion of practical examples of this kind we shall take one in which the attacker' s centre is particularly dynamic. Tarrasch - Alekhine Bad Pistyan, 1922 Blumenfeld Counter-Gambit

It is an irony of fate that the person to experience the might of the centre in this game should have been Tarrasch, a great devotee of the centre and a noted expo- nent of central pawn strategy. Such drastic examples of an action by the whole central mass in the attack on the castled king will not be found in contemporary master practice. The technique of playing against the centre has been so per- fected that one can no longer succeed by the single expedient of following the pattern of the game above. Masters no longer accept gambits like the Blumen- feld; on all occasions they examine the extent of the compensation or the possi- bility of play against the centre, either by counterattacking it with pawns, or by
204 The Art of Attack in Chess
exerting a restraining pressure on it with their pieces. The central formations which occur nowadays in master chess are not as a rule so uncompromisingly le- thal as this one, but instead tend to be critical and sensitive formations, which de- mand an extremely precise use of the pieces if they are not to become weak and collapse. As a result of this characteristic sensitivity of central formations in the games of present-day masters, the temporal aspect of such actions has also al- tered, and nowadays one rarely sees a full pawn centre being maintained for many moves; it usually appears as a transitory feature, a phase of the game which is immediately followed either by an attack on the castled king or some other ac- tion. The following game provides an illustration of this kind of temporary, flexi- ble centre and of a rapidly developed attack on the castled king.

Black's dark-squared bishop is exchanged in order to simplify the position further. Each exchange, as a rule, helps to diminish the power of the pawn centre and increases the significance of a queenside majority, which Black has here.

An attempt to put pressure on the centre and induce e5, after which Black can play ...£ki5. However, White can leave his pawn on e4 for the time being and first strengthen his position in readiness for an attack on the castled king. The weak side of 15... f6 stems precisely from the possibility of gaining a tempo by at- tacking the knight with e5; without this White would have no advantage. In the very line Black used here to simplify the position (moves 6-9) the exchange of the f6-knight, the piece exposed to attack by e4-e5, is an essential part of Black's whole system; now, however, a knight appears again on f6 and with it the attack- ing motif e5. Even so, 15...Nf6 is not a mistake, for other moves are no better; the bad move has already been made - ll...Nd7?. It is true that the commentator Reinfeld Pieces and pawns in the attack on the castled king 205 mentions 15...Rf6 in his book on Keres, continuing with 16 e5 Rh6? 17 Rxh6 gxh6, according to the pattern of the game Reshevsky-Fine, Hastings 1937; in that game, however, Black's knight was on c6 and his queen's rook on d8, so that his simplifying manoeuvre was in order. In this position, though, White would continue 18 d5 exd5 19 Jlxd5 Bxd5 20 Sxd5 <Nc5 21 Sd6, and the pawn on h6 begins to totter, since 21... ?g7 or 21...#te6 is answered by 22 Nh4 followed by

White's pawn centre, which has now been standing on the board for a number of moves, provides a typical illustration of the sensitivity of such formations. The crisis has been mounting from move to move, and the question now is whether the time is ripe for e5 or whether the position still needs reinforcing. White can- not wait much longer, since Black has a strong card to play on the queenside, namely ...b5 and ...a5, etc. Keres decides on reinforcement and in doing so makes a mistake. Correct was 18 e5 immediately; reinforcement would perhaps also have worked, but in the shape of 18 2d 3. After 18 e5 there are two main ways open to Black (lines 3 and 4 below): 1) 18...Bxf3?isbaddueto 19exf6, when the threat of20Wg5 wins a piece. 2) 18...£te8 is not good, e.g. 19 £}g5 h6 20 Nxe6 fxe6 21 Bxe6+ h7 22 d5 with a large advantage for White. 3) 18...£kl5 19 Ng5 h6 20 £te4 Nc3 (otherwise 21 Nd6) 21 Nxc3 (21 4£}f6-l- is probably insufficient in view of 21...sfchS) 21...Rxc3 22 2e3 Rb4 (if 22. ..Rc6, then 23 2g3) 23 2g3 <Nh8 24 Rg4 (24 Bc2 is also good) 24...Rf8 25 h4 2c7 26 f4 2cd7 (alternatives are 26...g6 27 h5 and 26...uLd5 27 f5) 27 f5 exf5 28 Rxf5 Zxd4 29 Sxd4 Sxd4 30 e6 with advantage to White.

19.. .Nd5, then 20 £}g5 h6 21 Ne4 followed by £}d6. After 18 2d3 Black would
have to play 18...h6, in which case 19 e5 £kl5 20 £k!2 gives White the advantage. All these continuations serve to illustrate my thesis on the critical nature of the full pawn centre; objectively, White's success was quite possible, but one impre- cise move (18 Se3?) and everything has evaporated, as we shall see.
18...b5!
Now e5 is no longer a threat (because of the double attack after 19 e5 £}d5 20 £}g5 h6) and so Black is able to make progress on the queenside.
19 Sdel a5 20 a4 b4? (D)
While this is positionally attractive, it allows the initiative to slip out of Black's hands, with the result that White comes back into the game with pros- pects which are worth a draw at least. Black should have played 2O...bxa4 21 .xa4 h6 when White's attack would have petered out: 22 e5? (22 g4 does not work because of 22,..Rf4 while if 22 h3, Black plays 22. ..Rc4 23 -Nb3 Rb4)

21 d5! The immediate 21 e5 was not good, but it becomes favourable when pre- ceded by d5, for then the black knight's access to the d5-square is blocked, while Black can defend by 22 Le4! 23 Rxe4 Ng5 winning the exchange. Thus 21 fig3 is a better attacking attempt, with an unclear position. Pieces and pawns in the attack on the castled king 207 the e-file and the a2-g8 diagonal are opened up. An instructive way of using a flexible centre!

If, instead of 25..." hS, Black plays 25... f8?, the situation turns in White's favour, e.g. 26 Rxh7!

208 The Art of Attack in Chess
Keres did not notice the stronger move 23 £}d4! either during the game or in his commentary. Moving the knight to g5 keeps up the tempo of the attack but leads to no more than a skirmish on the focal-points h7 and f7, whereas moving it to d4, although less immediately forceful, opens up the more productive prospect of play against the focal-point g7, which is quite clearly the weakest point in Black's castled position. After 23 Nd4! Black is virtually obliged to continue 23...Nf8 24 Bc2 Ng6 25 .xg6 fxg6 when 26 £te6 wins the exchange, leaving him with insufficient com- pensation in return. Black's other continuations are weaker, e.g. 23...£jc5 (23...Nxe5? 24 Hxe5 Rxe5 does not work because of 25 xd8+) 24 f5 £te4 (if
24...Nxb3, White wins by 25 Rg5) 25 Hxe4 dxe4 26 Rg5 f8 (or 26...g6 27 e6

23... f8?
The move which loses the game. Correct was 23...h6 after which there is some doubt whether White can win. Keres carries on from 23...h6 with, among other continuations, 24 e6 hxg5 25 exf7+ ?xf7 26 Se7+ Ng8 27 h5 (if 27 Rxg5 or
27 Rd4, Black plays 27...Rc3, while 27 Sxg7+ Nxg7 28 xg5+ is insufficient
on account of 28...Nh8 when White has not got the time to play Se7) 27...Qc3? after which White obtains the advantage by 28 W7+ and 29 S7e3. However, in- stead of 27...Rc3?, Black can play 27...W4!, and after 28 fixd7 (alternatives are
28 g3 Rf5 and 28 Rg6 Rf6) 28...Sxd7 29 He8+ Rf8! 30 Sxf8+ <Nxf8 White not
only cannot win but even has the worst of it. The analysis can admittedly be
1 Black can unexpectedly turn the tables by 27...Rc3! 28 exf7+ &118, but White
can improve just before: 27 Ne7+ 'i'fS 28 Rf6 wins. Pieces and pawns in the attack on the castled king 209 improved at the beginning, for 24 e6 can be replaced by 24 Nxf7 followed by 25 e6+, but it is no longer clear that White has the advantage. Finally, one might consider trying 24 f4 hxg5 25 Rxg5, but this loses its power after 25...Rb6 26 f5 Nf8, since Black can meet 27 f6 with 27...£je6, threatening, in addition to the queen, 28...2c3. All these variations arising from the position on the twenty-third move pro- vide instructive illustrations of how to spot the correct focal-point. The analysis of 23 £k!4! showed a typical attack on g7 ending in success for White, whereas in the continuation after 23 £}g5 ?! h6! a consistent attack could not be built up against any focal-point; White's operations instead took on the character of an at- tempt to destroy the black king's pawn cover, and as a result Black obtained open lines for his pieces as well as the time in which to organize his defences.

A desperate move, but Black no longer has an adequate defence. White could also have played 26 Rxd8+ now and won by virtue of being the exchange ahead, but he prefers to seek a mating attack, which brings even quicker success.

210 The Art of Attack in Chess
which the pawn drives off one of the opponent's pieces or creates a sharp threat of some kind. A typical example of the bayonet attack is the move g4, whereby White prepares the advance g5 and an attack on Black's knight at f6. The follow- ing examples show us some typical cases of the bayonet attack. The following position arose in Keres-Petrov, Estonia-Latvia Match, 1939 af- ter the moves 1 e4 e6 2 d4 d5 3 Nd2 dxe4 4 Nxe4 Nd7 5 Nf3 Be7 6 Bd3 £jgf6

14...h6, White would continue 15 h4, threatening g5 with even greater effect;
against 14. ..g6 he would not play 15 g5 immediately (since Black would reply
15.. .Nh5), but 15 h4 followed by h5. Finally, if 14...Bd6 then 15 f4 is very
strong. 15 g5! White does not worry about his rook, since if 15...JLxhl, he can dictate mat- ters with 16 gxf6 Bxf6 (or 16...gxf6 17 Rg4+ h8 18 Sgl Sg8 19 Nxf7#) 17 £}d7 Rc6 18 Nxf6+ gxf6 19 g4+ Nh8 20 Rh4 f5 21 Rf6+ Ng8 22 2g 1+ jLg2 23 .h6 and mates.

Keres does not carry his attack to its logical conclusion, i.e. by the sacrifice 17 .xh7+ xh7 18 Rh5+ g8 19 f4 threatening Sg4-h4. This attacking position is strong enough to guarantee victory, although it still demands precise play. In- stead of 19 f4, Horowitz gives the weaker continuation 19 Hg3 Rxe5 20 Sh3 and shows that 20...f6 then parries White's attack.

White now played 26 d6 and won in a few moves. By 26 £jh8 he could have forced Black to resign at once. This position is from the game Alekhine-Weenink, Prague 1931. In this case too White produces the bayonet in the form of: 1 g4! Alekhine, in My Best Games of Chess 1924-1937, says of this move: 'This lit- tle pawn threatens by its further advance to set on fire the black king's residence - and cannot possibly be stopped from that dark design.'

Pieces and pawns in the attack on the castled king 213 The pawn avalanche The formation composed of two or three neighbouring pawns on the same rank is often called a 'phalanx' in chess literature, but when such a phalanx attacks it can also be suitably described as an 'avalanche' or 'roller'. An attack based on a pawn avalanche generally entails even more positional commitments than the bayonet attack, as it involves advancing two pawns instead of only one. On the other hand, the avalanche's power is also greater than that of the bayonet, for an avalanche drives all the enemy pieces before it and offers more attacking possi- bilities. When attacking by means of a pawn avalanche, it is usually important that one's opponent should be unable to retaliate in the centre or on the other wing. This is, admittedly, a general condition for any kind of attack on the castled king, but in the case of an attack using pawns it applies even more strictly, since one is more restricted positionally and the actual process of advancing pawns is slower than play with pieces, with the result that one's opponent has greater opportuni- ties for counterplay. The next example will show us a case where the conditions for an attack using the avalanche are favourable. This position is from the game Schlechter-Tarrasch, Monte Carlo 1903. It is White's move. 1 g4 The use of the avalanche attack is well justified in this position. Black has no counterplay worth speaking of either on the queenside or in the centre, so that the risk White accepts in being committed to deciding the game on the kingside is not great. Moreover, White already has a pawn at f5, which is in fact in his way at the moment. When the g-pawn moves up to its aid within just two moves, there is
214 The Art of Attack in Chess
considerable prospect of the position's being loosened up a little and that the f- pawn will acquire a dynamic potential, l... c5 2 Ji.bl a5 3 Nhl -£fd7 4 g5 f6?I would probably have been better. Moves which weaken the position, such as ...f6, should not be resorted to unless absolutely necessary. After 4...W8

5 h4 Bf8?
Certainly weaker than 5...Nf8; on his next move Black puts the bishop back on e7 and so loses two tempi. However, even after 5... f8 White's attack would be overwhelming.
6 Sgl i.e7 (D)
Tarrasch was not a master who would lightly agree to the loss of a tempo, but in this case he was clearly convinced that his original plan had no prospects. This is evident from White's threat (Black's bishop is still on f8) 7 Rg4 (not 7 Rh5 followed by 8 g6? because of 8...h6, and Black would be saved by the blocked position ) 7... h8 8 .xc5 dxc5 9 Ne4, when Black's defences give way under the pressure against the squares f6 and d6.
7 Rh5 8 Sg3 2a8
There are no useful moves that Black can make in his cramped position. After, for example, 8.., cd7 9 Scgl Sc8 10 Ne4 he finds himself in a sad state, with- out a satisfactory defence against the threat of 11 gxf6 Bxf6 12 Rh6.

H e4Wd8 125(11 1-0. Black cannot prevent the collapse of the weak point f6. If 12...?ki7, then 13 gxf6 JLxf'6 14 5xd7 Rxd7 15 xf6+. In this example three phases in White's attack should be noted. The first is the creation of the advancing pawn avalanche, the second consists of the deployment of White's pieces, and the third is the actual execution or breakthrough. The avalanche alone cannot, as a rule, be decisive, and its greatest enemy is the danger of blockade. Combating this danger depends for the most part on piece play, and this takes two main forms: allowing the position to be blocked and then breaking it up by sacrificing a piece; or first sacrificing the piece and then pushing forward with the pawn avalanche without any fear of its being blocked. In the following games we shall see these methods being applied; de- stroying the enemy pawn cover is essentially the main combinative element.

8 cxd5 exd5 9 Bd3 Bb7 10 O-O-O c5 11 h4 c4? (D) Logically, Black must attack on the queenside, but his plan is too slow. Before he can set up the avalanche formation with pawns on c4 and b4, White will have a flourishing attack since his pieces are more active than Black's. Correct was 1 l...cxd4 in preparation for ...a6, ...b5 and ...Sc8; that would have constituted a more powerful threat.
216 The Art of Attack in Chess
12 Nf5 Se8
Kmoch, in his fine book on Rubinstein, thinks that even here ...a6 and ...b5 would have been better, but the black pawn can hardly reach b4, since after
12...a6 13 g4 there is an immediate threat of Bxf6 followed by g5, picking up the
booty on h7. If, for example, Black plays 13...g6 then 14 Bxd7 followed at once by Bh6 gives White a strong initiative. The text move prepares the way for ...£tf8, so White immediately takes the knight on f6 to prevent this.
13 Jlxf6 Nxf6 14 g4!
Thus a 'small avalanche' is formed on the fourth rank. Soon it will become 'great' on the fifth, and finally 'terrible' when it reaches the sixth en masse.

The fifth rank has been reached without Black having moved an inch on the queenside. If Black now plays 16...Nxg5, there follows 17 Nxg5 Rxg5 18 Bxh7+ <Nf8 19 h6! gxh6 20 Sdgl, etc.
16...Re7 17 Sdgl a6 (D)
Black reckons that nothing is threatened and devotes a tempo to his slow coun- terattack on the queenside. Admittedly, White would get nowhere by moving his pawns at this point: if 18 h6, the position is blocked by 18...g6; while if 18 g6, then 18...fxg6 followed by ...h6. However, White has another device, namely the sacrifice of his bishop, which enables the pawns to go ahead happily and without any fear of being blocked.

21 h6 (D)
The avalanche has come down on Black's pawns, which can no longer offer any help by blocking the position. Carried away by the spectacle on the board, Kmoch adds two exclamation marks, which I am unable to do, since I can see an- other continuation which is simpler, stronger, and even more 'Rubinstein-like' than h6, in that it links the combination with a positional breakthrough in the cen- tre: 21 £}g5 ! Bd5 (the f-pawn must not be moved because of 22 Rxc4+) 22 gxf7+ jlxf7 23 f3! Bd5 (otherwise fxe4 and e5) 24 h6 5ac8 (or 24...g6 25 Sh4) 25 fxe4 Bxe4 26 h7+ >h8 27 Rxe4! xg5 28 Rxe8+ and White wins1.

This makes White's task easier, though the game would not have been saved by the more stubborn move 21...fxg6. 21...exf3 would have been even weaker, e.g. 22 gxf7+ Rxf7 23 hxg7 with threats against h8 and h7. After 21...fxg6 Kmoch shows that 22 2xg6? is weak (because of 22...exf3, and Black gains too much material in return for his queen). He gives the follow- ing line as good for White: 22 Nh4 g5 23 £}g6 Rf6 24 h7+ <Nf7 25 h8W Sxh8 26 Nxh8+. However, the situation is somewhat doubtful after 26...<Ne7, for while

Here it is Black who is playing the Queen's Gambit, while White is building up his position according to the pattern which Black uses in the Semi-Slav De- fence, to which the move Bf4 is a useful addition. This is an example of a so- called inverted opening, in which White plays Black's system with a tempo in hand. 5 i.d3 2>c6 6 Nd2 Jle7?!

Pieces and pawns in the attack on the castled king 219 Black does not appreciate the real nature of the position and is not taking measures to obtain counterplay at the right time by means of an outpost on one of the central squares. He even surrenders control of the important e4 and e5 squares to White, and as a result suddenly comes up against the storm of an at- tack on his castled king. The correct course was 8...cxd4 9 exd4 xe5 10 dxe5 Nd7 11 Qh5 f5 ! when Black can meet 12 f3 by 12.,.Rc7 and 12 g4 by 12...#te5

9 g4! (D) Throughout the opening stage of the game the conditions required to justify a 'bayonet attack' have been gradually accumulating. One group of these condi- tions has already been noted in the shape of Black's inferior moves and his lack of concern to control at least one of the important squares e5 and e4. The other group can be revealed by an analysis of the structure of White's position. This is clearly distinguished by good piece play together with a modest but sound pawn formation in the centre. Indeed, its essence lies in the very soundness of the for- mation c3, d4, and e3, with the strong protection which it gives to the square d4. If this solidity in the centre did not exist, Black would be able at the last moment to organize a counterattack in the centre as an answer to White's attack on his castled king. His security against such a central counterattack - generally the main weapon in an active defence against an attack on the castled king - gives White great free- dom in his attack on the castled position and is basically the main justification for the move 9 g4 !.

Concluding remarks Before we conclude this discussion of the role of the pawns in the attack on the castled king, we must warn the reader of the immense diversity of practical cases which resist all attempts to embrace them within a set of rules. Our acquaintance with certain rules should not lead us to handle the game in a routine fashion; the particular characteristics of every position must always be thoroughly examined from one move to the next. In connection with pawn attacks, there are two cases worth mentioning which often arise in practice. In one case the position requires a rigid, positional use of the pawns in attack, and in the other the position is not at all suitable for the co- operation of the pawns and consequently the attack is better carried out by the pieces alone. For these two cases some suitable examples will now be given. This position is from the game Steinitz-Marco, Nuremberg 1896. White is the more aggressively placed but Black's position is fairly solid, especially in the centre, where White lacks a pawn base. The diagonal a2-g8 may become danger- ous for Black, but it is not so yet, for if jtc4+, Black can play ..Be6. Nor are the conditions favourable for an attack with the 'bayonet' or 'avalanche' here; there- fore, another way has to be found to strengthen White's position, one which is es- sentially of a purely positional nature. Steinitz finds it: he advances his f-pawn to
224 The Art of Attack in Chess
f5, where it restricts Black; the fact that this leads to a blocked position is a good thing, since Black's f-pawn can then be fixed at f6 and subsequently 'rolled up' by g4 and g5. This is a clear positional plan, which leads to the destruction of Black's pawn chain and thence to a real attack on his castled king. There is no bayonet or avalanche here, though pawn moves are still the decisive means of at- tack. 1 f4! Nd7 Black wants to get his bishop to c6, since it cannot settle on the diagonal a2-g8 because of f5. If 1...Bg4, then 2 Sd2 followed by h3 is strong, while 1...g6 would be a voluntary weakening of the castled position.

Black has no satisfactory answer to g5. If 4...h6 5 h4 <2Bh7, we get 6 g5 fxg5 7 hxg5 and then either 7...£3xg5 8 Rxg5 and 9 2hl+ or 7...hxg5 8 Rh3, threaten- ing 9 Rxh7+.

2xh7 13 Rxf6+ Sg7 14 Sxe5 1-0 As our second concluding remark we cited the case where the player has a choice between attacking with his pawns and attacking with his pieces. Every practical player will have experienced the difficulty of such a choice, and an im- mense amount of time has been consumed in master chess on such decisions. The trouble is that it is difficult to set up any general rule, since everything de- pends on the particular characteristics of the situation concerned. Before discuss- ing this question any further, let us take an example, and then, by varying the pawn structure, try to penetrate to the heart of the problem. Pieces and pawns in the attack on the castled king 225 It will be easy for the reader to see that this position has arisen as the direct re- sult of a classic bishop sacrifice. It is clear that White must aim to get a rook on to the h-file, and the only question is how to do it. One way would be f4 and then Sf3-h3, and the other Sel-e3-h3. The first is faulty and allows Black to draw, while the second is correct and leads to a win for White. The position is such that only the pieces can cope with the task; the pawns should stay at home to avoid getting in the way. The following variations prove this assertion. 1) 1 f4?Rd7 Of course, Black must on no account play l...Se7?, since 2 Sf3 would result in the loss of his rook.
2 Rh5+ Ng8 3 Sf3
White has nothing better. After 3 g4 g6 4 Rh3 4jh7 5 <£jf3 £k6 6 £}h4 £te7 White is still unable to play f5 as planned, while Black obtains counterplay by ...c5, etc. Also good for Black is 3 f5 exf5 4 Sxf5 Rxf5 5 Rxe8 £jc6.
3...g6 4 Rh4 (D)
Or 4 Rh6 Rg7.

This forces a draw. It is of no importance to our thesis whether Black can now play for a win, e.g. by 4...Rg7 followed by ...£k6 and ... e7 or ...£k!8, etc. 5Sh3 White cannot avoid the exchange of knights; if 5 <Nh3, Black gets time to bring out his queen's knight and set up a complete defence.

Black is tied up on the kingside, and White's best plan consists of trebling on the h-file. White carries out the necessary regrouping in such a way that not only is Black's bishop prevented from penetrating but also his rook's invasion along
1 Here Vukovic overlooks that White can mate in two by 7 Rf6+. However, his
thesis is basically correct, because the stronger move 4...Rg7 casts doubt on White's attack. Pieces and pawns in the attack on the castled king 227 the c-file is deferred; at the same time, he over-protects the e5-square as a pre- caution against any desperate sacrifices.

18...Sec8 19 Sh6 Nd3 20 Rh4 SC1+ 21 *f2 Sfl+ 22 <Ng3 and Black cannot
prevent mate by Sh8+. In comparing these two variations, the reader cannot but recognize the essen- tial feature of the position that condemns 1 f4? to failure but brings victory to the attack carried out by the pieces. The move f4 obstructs both the diagonal for the bishop on cl and the f-file for the rooks, and so limits the possibilities of action along the very two lines on which Black is weak. His weakness on the f-file can be seen at a glance, and it is not difficult to deduce (on examining the diagrammed position) that he will also be weak on the dark squares, since he will be unable to postpone ...g6 for long. After f4 White is left with only his domination of the h- file, whereas if he does not play it, he also has the f-file and a line of action for his bishop, and it is the combination of all these factors that gives him victory. We shall now vary the position of the pawns in front of White's king in the above diagram, so as to train our eyes to be keener in spotting the various finesses contained in this kind of position. First let us suppose that White's f-pawn is already on f4 (instead of f2) and that it is White to move. Now, of course, 1 Sf3 will win at once, but if this possi- bility is excluded, e.g. by White's having his h-pawn on h3, what then? Even so, White wins - by 1 f5! exf5 (otherwise f6 is decisive) 2 Sxf5, and Black has no answer to the two threats of 3 Sf4 and 3 h5+ gS followed by either 4 £}f7 or
228 The Art of Attack in Chess
4 Sxf8+ Nxf8 5 Rh8+ and the queen mates on g7. If, for example, 2...Rd7, then
3 Rxf8+, while if 2...g6, then 3 Sf4 Rxg5 4 Rxe8.
The pawn on f4 wins in this case precisely because it disappears and in doing so immediately opens up the f-file with disastrous consequences for Black. Let us now try a variation with the h-pawn at h4 (rather than h2) (D). This position is fairly promising; White has his f-file and the bishop's diago- nal is free as in variation '2', but the h-file has to be opened up by advancing the h-pawn. All White has to do is induce ...g6, after which the task of line opening is made easier and a blocked position averted. White's best is 1 2el Rd7 2 Rh5+ g8 3 Se3 (forcing ...g6, since it threatens Sf3 and Sxf8+; thus if 3...Nc6 4 Sf3 £ki8, then 5 2xf8+ xfS 6 Rh8+ 7 Rxg7+ f7 8 xf7 Sg8 9 h7 and White wins) 3...g6 4 Bg4 Nh7 5 h3, when he has good prospects. If White's h-pawn is on h3, 1 h4 comes into consideration, with the idea of reaching a similar system to the one above, but with a tempo less. With White's g-pawn on g3 (rather than g2) the problem is more difficult, since the pawn is only in the way there. Perhaps White ought to give perpetual check at once. If 1 Sei, Black plays l...£k:6, after which 2Se3 does not work be- cause of 2...Rxg5, while after 2 g4 Rd7 3 Rh5+ sfcgS 4 Se3 g6 5 Rh4 Rg7 Black's defences are already in quite good shape. Things are different with the g-pawn at g4 (which is, admittedly, impossible after the classic bishop sacrifice, but that does not matter here) (D). In this case the third rank is clear for the rook, and in addition the pawn at g4 also lends force to the thrust f5. As well as the method starting with 1 Sei (on the pattern of variation '2'), still more successful here is 1 f4 (threatening Sf3) l...Rd7 2 Rh5+ g8 3 f5 and White must win. Here, finally, we have a case Pieces and pawns in the attack on the castled king 229 where an attack using the pawns is correct. One tiny change in the position and already the choice between attacking with pieces or with pawns has swung in fa- vour of the pawns. Such is the sensitivity of the attack on the castled king, and it is now clear how difficult it is to create any more definite rule on this point! Still, I shall attempt to conclude the chapter with a series of tips - which will naturally apply only generally. Ten Practical Tips 1) It is an essential condition for any attack on the castled king that the oppo- nent should not be able to counterattack in the centre or on the other side of the board, or rather that his counterattack should not be dangerous and not develop fully before the attack on the castled king. An attack using pawns usually pro- gresses more slowly than one with pieces, since it often contains moves without any immediate threat. So, before embarking on a pawn attack, one should beware particularly of the possibility of a counterattack by one's opponent. 2) A central pawn blockade prevents or limits counterattacks and so makes a pawn attack on the castled king easier. 3) One should always examine whether a promising attack can be made by the pieces alone, and if it can, the pawns should be left 'at home'. 4) As a rule, it is difficult for pawn assaults to succeed against unweakened castled positions, since the possibilities of blockade are very great. A prelimi- nary action by the pieces is necessary to produce a weakening of the castled posi- tion or to remove the possibility of a later blockade when the pawns advance. 5) Every blockade in the castling area radically changes the character of the position, for it affects the activity of individual pieces and the whole nature of the play which follows.
230 The Art of Attack in Chess
6) One's own pawns usually constitute a great obstacle to one's rooks; if a po- sition is characterized by the opponent's weakness on the files, the rooks are im- portant pieces and pawns have no business on these files, except when their advance actually helps to clear a file. Rooks can be particularly usefully de- ployed on the third rank, if it is clear of pawns (an example of this was provided by the variations arising from the diagram on p.224). 7) A pawn storm generally increases the risk of an inferior endgame. If other elements in the position are also weighted against an endgame, the added risk en- tailed in an attack on the castled king is acceptable. However, if the player has the necessary conditions for a good endgame, he must make certain that his assault with the pawns will be successful, for otherwise it represents a real risk. 8) A player who already has an advanced pawn facing his opponent's castled position but which somehow gets in his way (e.g. a pawn on f5) must contem- plate advancing the adjacent pawn, so that the lone pawn can be made an active component of an avalanche. Every advanced pawn presents a pretext for an ava- lanche and draws its neighbour towards it. This is least so in the case of an ad- vanced h-pawn and most so if the pawn is on f5 . 9) Attacks on the castled king in general, and those using pawns in particular, should always be judged on the basis of an assessment of the position as a whole. The placing of the pieces, the situation in the centre and on the other side of the board, positional strengths and weaknesses, how far the position is blocked, the prospects for the endgame - all these come into the reckoning which an experi- enced player must make before deciding to use his pawns in an attack on the cas- tled king. 10) Cautious before opening his attack, the player must be incisive, consis- tent, and merciless once he has set out on his attacking course. For an insufficiently justified attack is not helped by belated doubts, but only by resourcefulness in the struggle to provide one's opponent with the most difficult task possible.
9 The attack on the fianchettoed
and queenside castling positions Up till now we have, on the whole, based our examination of the various aspects of attacking play on the ordinary kingside castling position. The fianchettoed and queenside castling positions present certain special characteristics, which affect the particular forms of attack used against these types of position. The attack on the fianchettoed king position The term 'fianchetto' (from the Italian, meaning Tittle flank') denotes a bishop being developed on the flank (on g2, b2, g7 or b7), and if a player castles behind such a fianchetto formation, we talk of a fianchettoed king position. Castled positions of this kind have their own particular good and bad sides; these will be examined on the basis of Black's kingside fianchetto position, which occurs in the Dragon Variation of the Sicilian, and the King's Indian and Griinfeld defences. The good aspect of the position is, above all, its considerable capacity to resist attack along the diagonal bl-h7, thanks to the pawn formation, f7, g6, and h7; nor are the squares f6 and h6 too weak, for they are covered by the bishop on g7. The bishop is also well concealed against attacks and possibilities of exchange, while in many cases the defence is assisted by its ability to cover not only the squares f6 and h6 but also the possible mating square h8. Finally, the fianchettoed position is also suited for those operations in which the g-pawn disappears, as in the fol- lowing well-known manoeuvre: Black plays ...f5, and then, on White's reply exf5 he coolly continues ...gxf5, with the aim of strengthening his position in the centre. Without the bishop on g7 such play would be risky because of the open- ing of the g-file, but it often succeeds with the fianchettoed bishop, since the bishop defends Black's king on the g-file about as well as a pawn does. The weak aspect of the fianchettoed position lies in the fact that the position of the g-pawn at g6 simplifies the attacker's task in opening up the h-file by the ad- vance of his h-pawn; there is also a danger that the fianchettoed bishop may be exchanged either for its opposite number or some other enemy unit. Without the
232 The Art of Attack in Chess
bishop the castled position becomes weak and vulnerable and the squares previ- ously covered by the bishop form a typically weak network. Naturally, an attack on the fianchettoed king position is generally directed against these weak spots, and consequently, the assault by the h-pawn and ac- tions aimed at the exchange of the fianchettoed bishop are the principal weapons in the attack against such a position. First, we shall give simple examples of two typical operations: namely, the elimination of the fianchettoed bishop and the breaking up of the pawn structure in front of it. The first position is from the game Richter-Abramavicius, Hamburg 1930. It is White's move, and he sacrifices both his rooks for the fianchettoed bishop in order to be able to conclude the game by an attack on the weakened dark-square network.

The following position occurred in the game Szilagyi-Szabo, Budapest 1946. Black, to move, broke up the pawn chain h2-g3 by a sacrifice and proceeded to decide the game on a network of squares of the opposite colour to that of the fianchettoed bishop. I...Nxh2! 2 Nxh2 g4+ 3 sNgl -Nxg3 4 Se2 White loses, whatever the continuation, because of his weakness on the corre- sponding focal-points h2 and f2.

For White loses either his rook or his queen. Where there is a fianchettoed king position there is naturally no opportunity to sacrifice the bishop on h7; moreover, many other forms of sacrifice, typical enough in the case of normal castling, are out of the question against the specific structure of the fianchetto. A form of sacrifice which can be designated as char- acteristic in the case of a fianchettoed king position is that of the knight on f5. An example of such a sacrifice is provided by the next diagram. This position arose in the game Alexander-Pachman, Hil versum 1947. Against Black's fianchettoed king position White has a knight aggressively placed at g5, a 'little avalanche' of pawns on g4 and h4, a rook on gl and his queen covering some useful squares. Nevertheless, to 'unlock' Black's solid position a sacrifice is necessary.
234 The Art of Attack in Chess
Given the favourable supporting conditions, this typical 'anti-fianchetto' sac- rifice is absolutely correct. From f5 the knight controls the squares g7 and h6 and has the intention, above all else, of eliminating the fianchettoed bishop. If Black does not accept the sacrifice but plays, for example, l...Sae8, White continues 2 Nxg7 and then 3 f4 with good prospects, while if 1 Bf6, then 2 Nh6. The ac- ceptance of the sacrifice leads at once to a critical situation for Black as the reply gxf5 leads to a very dangerous attack, while the f5-square is well covered, and consequently there is no danger of Black making a counter-sacrifice on it. I...gxf5 2 gxf5 In positions of a similar nature one is often faced with the question whether it is better to take on f5 with the g-pawn or the e-pawn. The answer depends on the various characteristics of the position; one takes with the g-pawn, if the opening of the g-file or the diagonal dl-h5 brings with it a decisive advantage, while in playing exf5 one takes into account other possible advantages, namely, freeing the square e4 (on which a knight, for example, can take up a strong position) or opening the bl-h7 diagonal for the bishop, or perhaps to keep in reserve the con- tinuation g5. In this particular case the g-pawn is obviously indicated, since there is an immediate threat of Rh5.

The importance of removing the fianchettoed bishop at the correct moment in this kind of attack is shown by the next position, one which I reached in an analy- sis of the Dragon Variation of the Sicilian in my book, Contemporary Opening Theory. In my book I examined 1 Rh4, following it up by l...bxc3 2 Rh8+ Bxh8 3 Sxh8+ *g7 4Slh7#. However, fianchettoed king positions of this kind (with the defensive bishop, the knight on f6, and a pawn on e7) offer a great deal of resistance. Consequently, in spite of the thunder on the h-file, Black can answer 1 Rh4 with ! 2 Bxg7 bxa3! 3 Rg5 (if 3 gxh5, then 3...Nxg7, while if 3 iLd4, then 3...axb2+ 4 bl Ra5) 3...axb2+ 4 &bl <£'xg7 l , and now if 5 2xh5, then 5...jLa2+ 6 Nxa2 blW+, while if 5 gxh5, then 5... xc3 is in Black's favour. Because of this I have had to amend my original analysis of the diagrammed position and apply more drastic measures to eliminate the fianchettoed bishop. In this line 4...Rxc3! is immediately decisive, since 5 Bxc3 Jla2+ leads to mate.

The attack on the queenside castled position Before discussing the attack on the queenside castled position, one should first of all examine the differences between this type of castling and kingside castling. Some writers in the past have supposed that the difference is considerable and that castling long 'is much weaker than castling short'; this is a great exaggera- tion. The castled position after long or queenside castling differs from the short castled position only in this respect, that the positions of the king and rook are both a square nearer the centre of the board. This can be useful for the rook, but it usually presents difficulties to the king, which is safer on gl than cl. Reckoning The attack on the fianchettoed and queenside castling positions 237 in terms of tempi, the following picture sums up the differences: the position on the queenside which would correspond symmetrically to the one given by short castling (king on gl and rook on fl) is king on bl and rook on cl, and to reach such a position after castling long would require two tempi. But let us now apply a different method of calculation: the player has castled on the kingside and then spends one tempo on the move Se 1. The corresponding position to this on the queenside would be king on bl and rook on dl, and for this only one move is needed after castling long. The conclusion to be drawn from this is simple - whenever the rook is well placed on the d-file, castling long is fundamentally as good as castling short; if the rook is in fact needed on the c-file it is weaker by two tempi, while if the rook is needed on a third square it is weaker by only one tempo. In practice castling queenside usually occurs when the rook is well placed on the d-file, and indeed the need for it to be placed there is often the prime reason for adopting long castling. When reckoned in these terms, the practical differ- ence between long and short castling disappears or becomes insignificant. There is yet another difference between the two forms of castling, but it is secondary and concerns the activity of the queen. However, here too the advantages and dis- advantages tend to cancel each other out. Thus one can say that castling on the queenside is almost equal in status to castling on the kingside in general terms of tempo and security. If there are still players who doubt the security of castling on the queenside, it might be suggested that their reasons for this are probably of a subjective, rather than an objective, nature. That is to say, many players remem- ber some bad experiences which they have had with castling long and are not aware of a very common mistake, one which is repeated over and over again: they accept the tempo gained on the d-file by castling long as a gift, without wanting to pay the price for it; they neglect the consolidating move bl, and then, when their opponent suddenly sweeps down, it is already too late and there is no time left. The results, of course, are blamed on queenside castling. In master chess castling on the kingside predominates, but this is not the result of some fundamental weakness of castling long; the reasons are of another, struc- tural, kind. Castling on the queenside requires the development of three pieces, while in the case of castling short only two need be moved to clear the back rank. Another important point is that in order to castle on the queenside the queen has to be moved first, and the best moment for doing this in many openings occurs rather later, as moving the queen at an early stage of the game can turn out to be a loss of a tempo. This is an important reason for the comparative rarity of castling on the queenside, and the trend is given further impetus by the structure of mod- ern openings, the majority of which are directed towards a struggle over the
238 The Art of Attack in Chess
central squares. In this the c-pawn plays an important part both in covering the d-pawn and in effecting a lateral attack; this delays the queen' s development on the one hand, and also slightly weakens the queenside on the other, consequently reducing the circumstances which favour castling long. There are quite a few situations in the openings when castling on the queen- side can be usefully applied, and in some cases one can say that it in fact repre- sents the best solution to the basic problem of building up the position. We shall now list the main factors which would usually endorse the choice of long castling in a game: 1 ) The pawn position on the kingside has already been weakened, while that on the queenside is sound; this may incline the player towards castling long. (If castling on the kingside is quite impossible or is obstructed, then naturally there is no choice at all.) 2) The opponent's forces (pieces or pawns, or both) are favourably placed for an attack on the short castled position, but unfavourably for one on the long cas- tled position. 3) The kingside is not sufficiently developed, while on the queenside the back rank is already clear. If this is the case when the situation demands castling as soon as possible, then castling takes place on the queenside. 4) One's opponent has castled on the kingside, and the weaknesses in his cas- tled position can only be properly exploited by means of an assault by one or more pawns. If in such a case castling on the queenside is readily available and there are no other factors militating against it, one castles long rather than short. An assault by the h-pawn with the aim of opening up the h-file for the rook is of- ten the answer to a fianchettoed king position, and in this case too castling on the queenside is indicated. 5) A rapid deployment of the rook on the d-file gains an important tempo or some other advantage, and in such a case castling long can afford an excellent so- lution. The factors listed here are only intended as general hints for the player, and the particular characteristics of the actual position should be surveyed each time one makes a choice between castling moves. Black, particularly, should be careful if he intends to castle on the queenside, since experience has shown that the neces- sary conditions for long castling more often arise for White than for Black. When Black's long castling coincides with short castling by White one gets a case of opposite-side castled positions; this leads to an intensification of the game, which naturally favours the better developed side, and this in the majority of cases is White. The attack on the fianchettoed and queenside castling positions 239 However, caution over deciding to castle on the queenside should not be over- done, since many cases arise where castling long is indicated but where the player does not do so because a prejudice about its risk deters him. Here is an ex- ample of unprejudiced castling on the queenside from the game Keres-Reshev- sky, World Championship Tournament, The Hague/Moscow 1948: Black is to move; his position is apparently inferior, since he is threatened not only by Nxd5 but also Nxb5. Besides this, he has not yet castled, so that he is faced with a double task: to discover a reply to White's threats and also make the time to castle. Here is how Reshevsky solved the problem: L..g5 2 Ng3 Rb7! Black has already shown by 1 ...g5 that he does not intend to castle on the kingside, and now he gives up his pawn on d5 in order to use castling long to ob- tain an important tempo and gain control over the central squares d4 and d5 (2... e7 would be weak because of 3 xb5). 3 xd5 O-O-O! Black's castling on the queenside in the Open Variation of the Ruy Lopez (which was how this game began) qualifies as a curiosity, and many masters shook their heads when they saw what Reshevsky had done. In this case it was correct to overcome the prejudice about the unsuitability of castling long in the Ruy Lopez, for here this very move provides a happy solution to the problem: it gives Black the time he needs and consolidates his king position better than short castling would. It should also be noticed that the weaknesses at a6 and b5 are not particularly marked, since White does not possess the move a4 which would properly probe them. Another point is that castling long has lent power to Black's g-pawn; its advance to g4 is important in the struggle for the square d4.
240 The Art of Attack in Chess
The knight here is 'attacking empty squares,' but 4 would have been no better. The most important point is that White cannot play 4 c4 to support the knight on d5, since it would be answered by 4...g4 5 Nh4 (or 5 £tel £ki4 6 Rd3 .f5) 5...Nd4 6 Rd3, after which either 6...c6 or 6..Bxd5 is in Black's favour.

The rest of the game is not of interest to us here; Black's active piece play serves as sufficient compensation for the pawn, there is no question of his castled position being in danger, and it is really White who is in difficulties. In the end White did in fact lose the game after making some rather weak moves. Our further consideration of the attack on the long castled position will be confined to those features which are specific to queenside castling. This means, in the main, that we need only consider positions where the king is still on cl, since if it has already retired to bl a position has arisen which corresponds sym- metrically to that after castling kingside. This position is taken from the game Rabinovich-Romanovsky, Moscow
1925. Black, to move, has no way of preventing exf6 and in desperation plays for
a counterattack on the enemy king based on the pattern of Boden's Mate (see p.76).
1...1.a3! 2 exf6?
White, who has in fact the better of the game, here takes the wrong path and spends a tempo on 'burying the corpse on f6' instead of using it to consolidate his threatened king position, e.g. 2 Sxd3! Sxd3 3 bl ! and if 3...Rc5, then 4 Na4 and finally 5 exf6, etc.
2...Rc5 3 Bd2?
The attack on the fianchettoed and queenside castling positions 24 1 After this second mistake Black has a winning position. White should have played 3 Sxd3 Hxd3 4 <£bl! and if 4... .xb2, then 5 Na4, or if 4...fixc3, then 5 bxc31, when Black can probably draw but cannot achieve more.
3...Ng6! (D)
The precious bishop retires and thus stops White playing £tel followed by Nc2 with gain of tempo. 4Wa4 While this does not give his opponent much trouble, White's other moves are also of little use. The situation is now typical of attacks on the queenside castling position and a similar arrangement of pieces often arises in practice. So let us look at the whole repertoire of combinations at Black's disposal which lead to mate. First, it is clear that White could not play 4 bxa3, because of 4...Rxa3#, with the typical pattern of Boden's Mate. Next, it can be seen that if 4 Rf4, Black has
4.. .5ac8, threatening 5...Rxc3+ and mate, thanks to the formidable effect of
Black's bishops. It is true that White could meet 4...Sac8 with 5 Re5, but then
5.. .Rb4 would be decisive. There still remain some other defences, which are
worth setting out: 1) 4 Sdel Sxd2! (if 4...Sac8, White would reply 5 dl 1) 5 'Nxd2 (5 Nxd2 is also inadequate, e.g. 5...Rxc3+ 6 &dl Rc2-F2 7 Ne2 Rd3+ 8 dl 2c8 9 Se4 Jlb4 10 Sxb4 Scl+ 11 &xcl Rc2#) 5...Sd8+ 6 <Ne2 Nd3+ 7 <Ndl Ne4+! 8 >e2 (or 8 £kl2 Nxd2+ 9 Nxd2 Rd4+ and mates) 8...Rc4+ 9 <Ne3 Sd3+ and Black mates. 1 4...fiac8 also wins as after 5 S dl Bxb2 White is defenceless.
2 Black can mate in two by 6... .c2+.

2) 4 Shel Sac8 5 2e3 Rb5! (yet another threat arising from the position of the rook at c8!) 6 bxa3 Wbl#. 3) 4 Sd4 5 Rg5 Rb4 and mates. 4) 4 JLel ! (relatively the best method of defence) 4...Sxdl+ (if 4...Rf5 5 Sxd8+ Sxd8, White has the reply 6 Re4!) 5 &xdl Sd8+ 6 .d2 (if 6 cl,
6...Sd3 is decisive) 6...Bxb2 7 fxg7 Sc8 and White must either give back the
piece or consent to 8 Na4 Rc2+ 9 e2 Rd3+ 10 el .cl ! 11 Rb4 a5 12 Rf4 Hc4, when Black wins.

5 WxbS1 is defeated by 5...Sab8! 6 Rxc5 .xb2#. Still another of the numer-
ous mating patterns in this kind of position!

1 Vukovic does not mention the far more resilient defence 5 Rb3, when Black
has to play very precisely to retain an advantage: 5...b4 6 Rc7 7 Sxd8+ fixd8 8 d4 Eb8 ! 9 bxa3 bxc3 10 Nb5 Rc6 11 a4 a6 12 Rc3 Rxg2 13 fidl axb5 and White's king remains extremely exposed. The attack on the fianchettoed and queenside castling positions 243 The following game serves as a demonstration both of how castling queenside forms part of a plan of development and of how an attack can be carried out against such a position. Lasker - Marshall St. Petersburg Final, 1914 Petroff Defence
1 e4 e5 2 Stf3 3 Nxe5 d6 4 Nf3 Nxe4 5 Re2
Morphy's old move; it is sound enough, though it gives White no more than a microscopic advantage. Correct, of course, is 7... xe2+ 8 .xe2 $Lel or 7... bd7. Avoiding the ex- change of queens favours White, whose position is the better developed. One might say that Lasker knew which opponents it paid to play drawing variations against!
8 c3 &bd7 9 O-O-O
Castling on the queenside is completely justified in this position, where the bishop is hemmed in at fl. Moreover, on the d-file the rook supports the d-pawn in moving to d4 and then threatening to advance to d5.
9...h6 10 Nh4 g5 11 Ng3 2>h5 12 d4 £txg3 13 hxg3 g4 14 Nh4!?
A risky and adventurous move, typical of Lasker's play in the middlegame. The knight clearly has no good way of getting away from the h4-square, a cir- cumstance which could have helped Black to equalize. Better would have been
14 Nd2.
14...d5?
A decisive mistake. Black should have played 14...£}b6! and if 15 d5 then
15..Bd7. Against other attempts by White, the reply ...Rg5 plays an important
part. However, moves like 14...Nb6! were not to Marshall's taste. What he really enjoyed was setting a trap for his opponent!
15 Rb5! O-O-O (D)
Castling is forced, since 15...Rb4 comes to grief after 16 xd5 Rxb5 17 £}xc7+. It was probably because of this trap that Marshall played 14. ,.d5?, but Lasker naturally refuses to be diverted by the d-pawn and calmly plays for an at- tack on the castled position with 16 Ra5 . Vukovic doesn't actually say what the trap is - the point is that after 15...O-O-O,
16 Nxd5 fails to 16...Bxd5 17 Rxd5 Rg5+ 18 Rxg5 hxg5 and the knight is
lost. The Art of Attack in Chess Perhaps Lasker even played 14 Nh4!? exactly because he knew Marshall would be tempted to set a trap and thereby get himself ensnared in the attack on the castled king which now follows.
16 Ra5 a6
Clearly, 16... b8 fails against 17 Nb5. 17 jlxa6! A correct bishop sacrifice.
17...bxa6 18 Rxa6+ Nb8 19 Nb5 <?)b6 (D)
Now that the black king has moved from c8 to b8, the distinctive character of the queenside castling position no longer exists and the situation is merely a rep- lica of a type of attack used against the short castled position. An important advantage for the attacker in this position is his ability to bring a rook into action quickly (Sd3-b3), since without this Black could defend himself by ...£k8 and then ...,Nd7. The attack on the fianchettoed and queenside castling positions 245
20 Sd3 Rg5+
This move simplifies White's task somewhat. However, Black could not have saved himself even by 2O...Nc4 which contains the transparent trap 21 Sb3? Rg5+ 22 bl £\12+. At the time Lasker had reckoned on defeating 2O...Nc4 in the following manner (and this has found its way into the commentaries): 21 Sei? (in order to be able to meet 21...Rg5+ with 22 Se3) 21...Sd6 22 Nxd6 Rxd6 23 2b3+ Nb6 24 a4 Nc8 25 Se8 Rd7 26 b5 Rxb5 27 Sxb5 Nb7? 28 a5 Bd7 29 Sxf8 Sxf8 30 Sb4 and White goes on to capture the knight, after which he is a pawn up in the ending. Let us disregard any doubts about this ending, for Black has a stronger continuation than 27. .. b7, namely 27...Jlg7 28 Sxh8 .xh8; then White must play 29 a5 (otherwise the knight remains alive on b6) whereupon the main line runs 29.. Bxd4 30 axb6 c6 31 Sb3 Jlxf2 32 b7 (if White allows ...<Bb7, then the position is still more favourable for Black)
32 c4 35 Sa3 Jtd4, and it is clearly White rather than
Black who has to struggle for a draw. It is interesting to see how the original char- acteristic of the position (the inability of the knight on h4 to move) again emerges as the decisive factor as soon as the attack on the castled position peters out. Not even the best players are immune from such misfortunes! This game, which was the decisive one in Lasker's victory at St. Petersburg, cannot be left to go on sleeping in the archives of chess history with an inaccurate commentary. Good games should not be allowed to go to their rest without good annotations as their lullabies! Therefore, we must show how in fact White does win after 2O...Nc4 (D). So that there will be no doubt about it, we shall supply two winning moves, both of them instructive as far as carrying out an attack in this kind of position is concerned.
246 The Art of Attack in Chess
1) 21 a4! c6(Bf21...Sd6 22Nxd6Wxd6 23Sb3+Nb6, White wins easily by 24 a5) 22 Sb3 ! (not 22 Rxc6? because of 22...Rb7, forcing the exchange of queens and thus bringing the attack to a halt; nor does 22 Na7 work, e.g.
22...Rxa7 23 Sb3+ Nb6! 24 Sxb6+ <Na8, when White has to exchange queens,
leaving Black once again with the better game; obviously the intermediate
23...Nb6! is the key element here) 22...Rg5+ 23 bl Nd2+ 24 Na2. Now Black
is unable to take the rook on b3 with check, so White wins easily, e.g. 24... e7
25 Qb6+ Rb7 26 Rxd8+, etc1.
2) 21 Na7!2 Sd6 22 Hb3+ Nb6 (forced, since 22...fib6 is defeated by 23 3c6#) 23 a4 Bg7 (or 23...Rd7 24 Nb5 ! Sc6 25 Ra7+ <Nc8 26 a5) 24 b5 ! and White wins. 21 £bl Nd6 22 Eb3 She8 23 a4 Nf5 24 Na7 .d7 25 a5 Rd2 26 axb6 Sel+

29...<Nc8 30 Ra8+ Jlb8 leads to the picturesque 31 Ra6#. In this 'posthumous
finale' of the game Black's king and rook are back once again in the original long castling position! Black's best defence is 24,..2d7, when White must find 25 f4! Rf6 (25...gxf3 26 Nxf3 deflects the knight from the attack on b3) 26 Bc3 ! to keep an advantage. Recent analysis by Kasparov reveals a third possibility: 21 Hb3 Rg5+ 22 &bl Nd2+ 23 < al 2Bxb3+ 24 cxb3 -Id6 25 Ra7+ Nc8 26 Nxd6+ fixd6 (26...cxd6 27 f4! gxf3 28 £}xf3 and the rook reaches c 1) 27 Ra8+ d7 28 Rxh8 with two extra pawns.
10 Defending against the attack
on the castled king In presenting, up to here, the various aspects of the attack on the castled king we have looked at the operation from the attacker's point of view. However, it is also true that the defence against such an attack has its own principles and particular characteristics, and it is therefore fitting that we should also try to discuss this de- fence systematically. Chess literature tends for the most part to talk of active and passive defence as being the two main types of defence. Steinitz also introduced the term 'self- defence', and H. Kmoch (in his work The Art of Defence) speaks of 'automatic defence' . Although it is now fairly well established, this division is not really the happiest one for teaching purposes; moreover, when it is a question of defence against an attack on the castled king, it is an imprecise one. I think it better to talk of direct and indirect defence of the castled position, in which case the direct defence is predominantly 'passive' and the indirect always 'active'. The difference between these kinds of defence is usually clearly marked, since the former involves the defence of the actual castling area or the removal of one's opponent's aggressive pieces, while in the latter case it is a question of actions further away from the castled position, which the defender uses to keep the attacker so busy that he fails to pursue his attack to its conclu- sion. In actual play direct defensive moves usually occur in conjunction with those of an indirect kind, and the main rule is that direct defence should be economical and that indirect should be executed at the right moment. Economy in direct de- fence consists of not making superfluous moves and not employing an unneces- sarily large number of pieces in defence. The right moment for indirect defence is fairly difficult to gauge, since it is normally determined by two interacting fac- tors; on the one hand, when direct defence has reached the limits that necessary economy allows, and on the other, when the attacker has really made a move which commits him fairly strongly, i.e. he has staked his money on the success of the attack. First, we shall set out clearly the various elements which go to make up each type of defence.
248 The Art of Attack in Chess
A. Direct Defence 1) Protecting the squares of the castled position, including so-called over- protection. 2) Transforming the castled position by moving the pawns in front of the king, a particular case being the setting-up of a blocked position. 3) Altering the castled position by moving the king. Here it should be kept in mind that each move by the king changes the situation, changes the conditions necessary for an attack and, above all, changes the possible focal-points. King moves fall into the following graded categories: a) The consolidating move (e.g. bl in the case of queenside castling and hl in the case of kingside castling); b) A more radical alteration of the situation as a result of moving the king (e.g. to f2, thus producing a so-called 'semi-castled' position); c) A king's flight, i.e. when it goes out in front of the castled position. Steinitz called this the king's self-defence, an older and more correct term than that of 'automatic defence' applied by Kmoch. 4) Defence by means of repulsing one's opponent's pieces, through their cap- ture, exchange, or ejection from powerful positions. B. Indirect Defence Before considering the ways of using the indirect method we must first of all ex- amine three aspects of such a defence. The first is purely spatial, i.e. whether the defender carries out his own counterattack in the centre or on the wings; the sec- ond is concerned with the degree of the threat; and the third with the question of whether the indirect action turns at some point into the direct method of defence. In the following review we shall combine these three aspects: 1) The defender carries out a counterattack on the opposite side, where the at- tacker has castled. In such a case his action is usually itself an attack on the cas- tled king, the position being one where the players have castled on opposite sides. 2) An action on the opposite side first of all prepares the ground (files, ranks, etc.), and then turns into an outflanking manoeuvre against the attacker's castled position, i.e. while the attacker is attacking along the files, the defender gains control of the attacker's first or second rank. In this case, as in '1', the critical question is naturally either who will be the first to force mate or which of the two attacks will be brought to a halt through the diversion of pieces to provide a direct defence. Defending against the attack on the castled king 249 3) An action on any part of the board with the aim of gaining material. Such an action obviously only has a point when a forced mate is not part of the attacker's plan. The critical continuation then is that which costs the defender the least. For instance, if he can 'pacify the attacker's wrath' at the price of a knight, then a counterattack which brings him a rook is worthwhile. In practice the most important case is where the attacker sacrifices; the de- fender's repertoire is then greatly increased, since he is given various ways in which to return material in order to counter the attacker's plan. This method of returning material is extremely important; the extent to which it is possible af- fects the type of sacrifice which can be made, and the sacrifice is also a signal to the defender to counter with a sacrifice which would previously have been out of the question. 4) The counterattack results in material equality, but the question of position still remains open. Mate cannot be forced, both attacks are brought to a halt, and eventual simplification leads towards an ending. The resulting position, which is often extremely difficult to assess beforehand, is then decisive. 5) The defender's counterattack does not lead to a mating attack, nor to mate- rial or positional advantages, but instead consists of an eventual transition to the direct method. As a rule, this takes the form of either attacking the enemy pieces 'from the rear' or of gaining control of a file or diagonal so as to cover a certain square in one's king position (e.g. when the white queen has captured the square c7 and from there covers the focal-point h2). 6) A special case of the kind of counterattack mentioned in '3' is provided by the advance of a queenside pawn majority. Its aim is to promote a pawn to a queen, and such an advantage justifies the most generous surrender of material in order to curb the attacker's forces. 7) Retaliation in the centre can have the features of sections '3' to '5' either separately or combined. The following possibilities are particularly worth noting here: a) A central thrust demolishes or weakens the attacker's formation there and prepares the ground for further operations by the defender, or it enables him to transpose to direct defence 'via a turning manoeuvre'; b) The destruction of the pawn centre eliminates its auxiliary function with regard to an attack on the castled king. For example, the disappearance of a pawn on e5 can also mean the end of an attack on the castled king, if the pawn is vital to a certain continuation; c) Because of the danger of a central thrust, many attackers at a suitable mo- ment deliberately create a blocked position in the centre. As a rule such a central
250 The Art of Attack in Chess
formation cannot be rapidly activated except by the sacrifice of a piece. If the at- tacker has already used a sacrifice in attack, the defender is presented with an op- portunity of making a return sacrifice in the centre. For example, the defender's knight on c6 is sacrificed for White's pawns on e5 and d4, thereby creating the necessary conditions for various kinds of defence without loss of material; d) The destruction of the attacker's centre usually gives the defender the pros- pect of better conditions for positional play, as mentioned in section '4'. For it is not only that the opponent's centre pawns disappear, but the actual central squares also come under the defender's control; consequently, if the attack is held, the considerable positional advantage enjoyed by the defender persists, even when the material is equally balanced, until well into the endgame. This outline of defensive methods brings out above all else the richness of their variety and the flexible way in which they can be combined. Because of this, defence as a whole is harder than attack, and its finesses are as a rule more concealed than those of the attacker, a point already noticed long ago by Lasker. The importance of the centre must be particularly emphasized as the critical area where the decisive step is often made. The great variety of possibilities afforded by a defence based on an action against the centre gives such an operation first place in the defender's repertoire, and so every attacker must be able to calculate accurately what is likely to happen in the centre during an attack on the castled king. Defence by over-protection Passing now to some examples of direct defence, let us examine the following position, which can arise in the Closed Defence to the Ruy Lopez. Defending against the attack on the castled king 251 It is Black's move; he has to think how to supplement the direct defence of his king position, especially in view of White's threat of 1 £}h2 followed by 2 f4 and 3 f5. Black plays:
2 h2 f6
Now 3 f4 can be met by 3...<R3f7. Moreover, he can also answer most other moves by 3...Nf7, setting up a distinctive position with a 'double knight fian- chetto'. This position offers very strong resistance against all kinds of attack, and the reason for this lies in the over-protection of the squares f5, g5, and h5, at which points White might have been able to execute a breakthrough. These squares are now covered both by Black's pawns and his knights, an example of 'prophylactic over-protection', to use Nimzowitsch's phrase. The over-protection which Black achieves by transferring his knight to f7 is in this case neither a passive nor an uneconomical means of defence. It is not diffi- cult to establish that Black's knight on b7 has no better position anywhere than on f7 (if ...c4, for example, White plays b4 and does not allow ...£fc5); it is better to use the knight for defence, freeing Black's other pieces for later queenside ac- tivity. In some cases over-protection can mean economical direct defence; on the other hand, depending on the position, it may be superfluous. Defence by blockade A blocked pawn formation means a general reduction in the number of actions possible in any position, and as a result blockade is often the weapon employed by the weaker side. A means of defence which stands out as particularly impor- tant is the blockade of the pawns in front of the king.
252 The Art of Attack in Chess
The continuation from the above position shows us first of all a typical case of defence by blockade, and then the way to overcome this method of defence. Although White has the superior position with all his pieces directed against Black's kingside, he still can not achieve anything by 'normal' methods. If 1 g6, Black plays l...h6, while if 1 h6, then l...g6; in both cases blocking the pawns brings the attack to a halt. Attempts to break through by sacrificing a knight can simply be ignored by Black. Thus after 1 g6 h6 2 4T3 Bd7 3 £}g5 Black does not take the knight but waits; while if 1 h6 g6 2 Nh5, Black again does not need to take, for by playing 2...Nh8 3 <?3f6 Rf7 he can hold the draw. White's only chance in this position is: 1 £hg6 Nd7 Clearly, the knight cannot be taken. 1. .. ?f7 is met by 2 h6 and a breakthrough, since if 2...hxg6, then 3 h7 uke7 4 Rh4 followed by 5 3xg6.
2 Sghl!
White must play with great precision and thoroughly prepare for the break- through by h6 and hxg7. If he tries 2 h6 immediately, then Black replies 2...hxg6; then 3 hxg7 -Nxg7 is not dangerous while after 3 h7+ h8 4 Sh6 gxh6 5 gxh6 White's attack will probably not succeed.
2...c6 3 Rh2 fib7 4 h6 hxg6 5 hxg7 Bxg7 6 JXh8+ and White wins.
Defence by elimination Many examples could be given of defence based on the diversion or elimination of important attacking pieces, since such operations are often undertaken; how- ever, they are limited on the whole to one or two moves and do not normally pro- vide a complete system of defence but only force the attacker to remodel or reorganize his attack. Thus, for example, in the quite normal case where the at- tacker's knight has to retreat from g5 when faced with ...h6, the problem of de- fence has not as a rule been fundamentally solved, but rather the attacker has been obliged to redirect his attack, either by transferring his target from h7 to h6 or g7 or else by strengthening the pressure on h7 along the diagonal bl-h7. Spe- cial examples and analysis are not necessary in the case of such straightforward diversion of opposing pieces. We are interested here in those special cases when the diversion or elimination of the attacker's pieces represents the essence of the defence and is in fact fundamental in driving back the attacking force. The
1 Although after 4 Rh4 followed by h7+ White wins the g6-pawn, when the re-
sulting position appears very unpleasant for Black. However, it is true that White risks nothing by building his position up further before playing h6. Defending against the attack on the castled king 253 simplest example of this is the exchange of queens, which is usually to the ad- vantage of the defender and in many cases altogether eliminates the danger of at- tack. The queen is generally an essential piece in a mating attack and it is therefore useful to the defender if it is removed. However, other pieces too can be essential to an attack and can be the target of a defensive plan based on elimina- tion. One of the most typical instances involves the attacker's bishop which is covering a network of weak squares. Such a visitor should, as soon as circum- stances permit, be dismissed from the castling area or be eliminated by ex- change. The following diagram shows a case of a bishop commanding a network of squares, and we give two possible continuations: the one actually taken, where Black misses the opportunity to defend himself by tackling the bishop; and an al- ternative one, which indicates the correct method of defence. This position comes from the game Blackburne-Schwarz, Berlin 1881, and it is White's move. He is a pawn down and, in addition, he has the inferior pawn structure. On the other hand, he enjoys far greater activity for his pieces and has prospects of controlling the network of weak dark squares around the enemy king. It is exactly with this in mind that he plays: 1 i.f6 2tf4+? Black throws away the chance of defending himself by eliminating the bishop on f6 (with l..Be7!) and falls into a trap.
2 Rxf4! -Nxf4 3 2xh5 gxh5 4 Sxh5 and there is no remedy against mate on
h8.
1 In the original edition, this diagram was incorrectly given without the black
pawn on b5. Vukovic's comments have been modified to take account of this correction.
254 The Art of Attack in Chess
The essential attacking piece here is the bishop on f6 and it should have been eliminated. Therefore the only correct course is l..Jte7! (D). After 2 Be5 (or 2 Jtxe6 fxe6 3 Rg5 .xf6 4 Rxf6 Rd8! and Black is the better placed) 2..Bd6 White has nothing better than 3 and a repetition of moves; on any other move the elimination of White's dark-squared bishop affords Black p. a complete defence and the prospect of victory on the basis of his other advan- tages. Thus after 3 f4 Bxe5 4 dxe5 £}g7 White has nothing, while he is too weak for 3 Exh5? because of 3...gxh5 4 Exh5 Bxe5 5 dxe5 Ed4, whereupon the threat of ... f4+ destroys all his hopes. Before we leave the theme of defence by elimination, the reader must be warned of the mistakes which are often made in applying this method. Many players defend themselves by endeavouring to exchange all the attacker's ag- gressive pieces. Such a formula can easily lead to defeat. As a rule, one should aim to exchange those pieces which are essential to the execution of the at- tacker's mating threats, while on the other hand one should preserve those of one's own pieces which are carrying out an important defensive function. We have already seen how important it is to preserve the fianchettoed bishop, and much the same can be said for a knight at f6 covering the important square h7 . The king's self-defence There is a graded scale which can be applied to the king's self-defence starting from the so-called consolidating move and ending with the full flight of the king to the other side of the board. Examples have already been given of the former type, so we shall begin with cases where the king is already definitely on the move, even though it may only be along the edge of the castling area. The next Defending against the attack on the castled king 255 diagram is a typical example of self-defence by classically simple means: faced with White's pressure on h7, Black defends his pawn by advancing it and is not concerned about the square h7 itself; Black' s king reduces the value of the square by moving, for it no longer comes into consideration as a focal-point. This position is from Bogoljubow-Reti, Carlsbad 1923. Black played:
2 Nxf6 Bxf6 3 Rh7+ 4>f8
The Black king defends itself by flight; if now 4 Rh8+ 4>e7, White's position would only be made worse by his loss of a tempo. In the actual game White's ini- tiative dissolved after 4 Ecdl Eed8 5 4>hl 4?e7 6 £ke2 Sh8 7 Rc2 aS, and, thanks to the good self-defence effected by his king, Black soon obtained rather the better game. Another example of self-defence can be provided by my analysis of one of the critical positions in the game Reshevsky-Botvinnik, World Championship Tour- nament, The Hague/Moscow 1948.
256 The Art of Attack in Chess
Botvinnik (Black) played here l... g8?, which is an absolutely passive method of defence. It means that Black's king is left in the corner, and White is offered the chance to prepare the opening of the e-file by a pawn sacrifice based on Xl'6+. After the moves 2 Sei Rf7 3 c3 Na5 4 Sc6 White made the mis- take of playing 5 Bf6+ too early, without the preparatory 5 Sge3!, and thus did not make correct use of Black's error; we will therefore not concern ourselves with the game's actual course. Correct would have been l...Ng8!, followed perhaps by in which case the black king is only apparently 'courting danger'; in fact, it avoids all the difficulties associated with being in the corner and itself provides assistance in covering the important light squares e6 and g6; moreover, with the dark-square network alone White can clearly achieve nothing. Black is also left with an initia- tive on the queenside, where he is positionally set to win. If the reader tests the different variations after l... ?g8, he will convince himself of the strength of the black king's self-defence in this position.

That is where Black's chances lie, and consequently his king does not belong on the queen's wing but should stay where it is; the pawns in front of the king should not be touched, in order that he may retain as much chance as possible of defend- ing himself by blocking the position. Correct therefore was 13... .d7 planning ...Na4 followed by ...a6 and ...b5. If White plays 14 a4 then 14...Re8 15 a5 <£jbc8 followed by ...Sb8 and ...b5, etc.

Pawn majority on the wing Passing now to the theme of indirect defence, we first of all examine a counterat- tack by means of a pawn majority on the queenside. An analysis of a classic mas- terpiece will be helpful here. Pillsbury - Tarrasch Hastings, 1895 Queen's Gambit Declined, Orthodox Defence
1 d4 d5 2 c4 e6 3 Nc3 3f6 4 Ng5 i.e7 5 £tf3 bd7 6 Ecl O-O 7 e3 b6
These days it is considered more accurate to play ...b6 before committing the b8-knight to d7. 8 cxd5 exd5 9 Nd3 Nb7 10 O-O c5 11 Eel?! A move which does not belong to the system and only wastes time. At this point Pillsbury usually played 11 £te5 and his opponents allowed him to strengthen the position of his knight by f4. Marco later showed that after 1 1 £3e5 one should play ll... xe5 12 dxe5 £te8 13 Bf4 g6 14 Jlh6 *?3g7 15 f4 d4! an- swering 16 f5 with 16..Bg5. Defending against the attack on the castled king 259 Today 1 1 Re2 is considered strongest. Il...c4? Thus Black creates a pawn majority on the wing but surrenders his influence in the centre. It is now known that the situation in the centre is the more impor- tant; moreover, against an attack on the castled king it is easier to build up a counterattack using the centre rather than by means of a slow advance of the wing pawns. Instead of 1 l...c4? Black could have played, for example, 1 l...a6, which is in keeping with the system and does not immediately forsake the centre in the pro- cess. The modern answer would be 1 1...<Ne4, with the aim of clarifying the situa- tion. 12 kbl a6 13 2>e5 (D) Because of Black's mistake this move is now extremely strong, since White is able to consolidate the knight on e5 and use it as the basis for a later attack on the king. 13... xe5 will not do now, since 14 dxe5 is extremely awkward for Black.
13.. .b5 14 f4
This formation with a knight on e5 and pawns on d4 and f4 is called the 'Pillsbury attack', and it was in this game that the attack originated. Pillsbury was still experimenting with his idea here, hence his unsystematic move 11 Sei?!.

More precise, in fact, is 17...Rxe7 as will be seen from the note to Black's nineteenth move.
18 Bxe4
260 The Art of Attack in Chess
Pillsbury's contemporaries were a little surprised by this exchange, which he used to make regularly in this system. In fact, the move is absolutely logical from the positional point of view. White cannot worry Black any more as regards his control of e4, and it is better that the square should be occupied by a blocked pawn than an active knight. In view of Black's complete hold on e4, White's bishop on bl cannot be better employed than in dispatching Black's knight. This is an example of the logic, consistency, and lack of prejudice which runs through Pillsbury's style. 18,..dxe4 19 Rg3! f6 This move has been censured by earlier commentators because 'White's knight retreats with gain of tempo', but closer investigation shows that the move is not a bad one, or rather that Black has nothing better. 19...f5 would be danger- ous (because of White's eventual assault with g4), but otherwise it is difficult to find a natural way of parrying White's threat of 20 f5 followed by £rf4 or f6. It is important to note that 19...Rd6 20 f5 f6 fails because of 21 Ng6! Sd7 22 Ngf4, when White has realized his aim of posting a knight on f4 without having to ex- change queens. On the other hand, 19...Rc7 contains some dangers on account of 20 b3. If Black had recaptured with his queen on the seventeenth move,
19.. .Rd6 would now work, for 20 f5 f6 would force the exchange of queens. A
small and instructive detail! 20 >g4 >h8 21 f5! Rd7 22 Sfl Sd8 Black is planning ...Rd6, but he should have noted that White will be unable to play the fundamentally important move f4 for some time (because of ...Rxf5). He could therefore have devoted the tempo to preparing ...b4, e.g. by
22...5c8.
23 Sf4 (D)
Defending against the attack on the castled king 261 Here we shall stop a moment to describe the course of the game so far and to point out the characteristic features of the position. Black released his pressure on the centre early on and thereby allowed White considerable freedom in arranging his pieces for an attack on the king. Against this attack Black built up a typical, direct defensive position which offers consid- erable, but not absolute, resistance. His principal weapon in the event of a further concentration of White's pieces is, however, an indirect defence in the shape of the advance of the pawn majority on the queenside. Against a whole series of at- tacking plans Black has successful replies in the form of retaliation on the flank; a particular point is that White cannot force the move <£tf4. It was because of this that Pillsbury decided on 23 Sf4, i.e. he now abandons his preparations for Nf4 and regroups with the apparent intention of attacking e4. 23".Rd6 24 Rh4 2de8 25 4k 3? A weak move, for Black could now have played 25... b4 26 4k4 Bd5 27 4k5 4jd7 28 €)xd7 Sxd7, after which there is nothing left of White's attack, while on the queenside Black has moved closer to his goal. 25 4k2 was better, to prepare g4. Admittedly, if 25...'Ng8!, then 26 g4 does not work (because of 26...g5 27 fxg6 £jxg6 28 Rxf6 4}xf4 ! 29 Rxd6 £ xe2+ and 3O...4 xc 1, with a whole fistful of pieces for the queen); however, White can play 26 Rh3, to be followed by Sh4, g4, and £tf4, etc.
25... .d5? (D)
Not only does this throw away the chance of playing ...b4, it also allows White the following opportunity to simplify the position: 26 a4 b4 27 4)xd5 Rxd5 28 4W6 gxf6 29 Rxf6+ Sg7 30 Sg4 Rf7 31 Rxg7+ Rxg7 32 Sxg7 <Nxg7 33 Sxc4, when the ending favours White. 26 f2

White also retains the better prospects this way, though best would in fact have been 26 a4 as given above.
26...Rc6
Black could well have played 26... b4 and if 27 £te2 then 27...a5. 27 £}cxe4? would fail against 27...Rc6 followed, after a knight retreat, by 28...Exe3. How- ever, the text move is also correct.

29 Ng4 2Bd7 30 E4f2 (D)
The move is not a bad one, although it would not inspire commentators nowa- days to pour on it the praise with which it was once honoured. The point is that by
30 c 1 c3 31 b3 White obtains a position analogous to that actually reached, and
the only difference is that 30 E4f2 sets a trap for 3O... xa2. However, even that trap is not so terrible, for after 31 f4 jLf7 32 £sg6+ Ng8! (Reti only analyses the inferior 32...Jtxg6?) 33 £}xe7+ Exe7 34 Rg3 *f8 35 h3 (otherwise ...h5 wins the knight) 35...Ra5 Black still retains good prospects of counterplay, and it is not certain whether White can use his small material advantage to any real ef- fect.

A decisive mistake, entirely altering the situation. Black should at this point have thought a little about defence himself, leaving the tit-bit on b3, which could not run away, until later. Correct was 38...fxg5! 39 Rxg5 Nf6 when both 40 <£}e5 Rd6 and 40 Eg2 f8 leave Black the better placed. The essence of Black's de- fence in this case is the correctly-timed blockade of White's f-pawn by ...£\f6, without which there would be no answer to a breakthrough by White on that criti- cal square (f6).

52 Rxh7#
This famous game has its place in chess literature as a classic example of an at- tack on the castled king which is stronger than the counterattack on the queen- side. But in the light of my annotations, which differ fundamentally from all annotations hitherto, from Tarrasch to Reti, this game takes on a new appearance. Black's numerous opportunities to strengthen his game at various stages point rather to the equal balance between the attack and the indirect defence, and it was only the decisive mistake on the thirty-eighth move which swung the balance in White's favour. This view of the game also qualifies it as a good example of the importance of indirect defence against an attack on the castled king, and of the part played by operations with wing pawns in particular. Indirect defence by means of advancing a pawn majority on the queenside was at one time held in high esteem and was more often practised than nowadays; the real reason for this is that we have acquired a better understanding of the centre and the technique of centralization, thanks to the hypermodern school. It is clear that the player who has a majority on the wing, when the material is equally bal- anced, will usually not have the greater influence or pressure in the centre, nor will he have the necessary conditions for a central action. A majority on the wing is created at the expense of the centre and means giving up lateral pressure on the centre, and that is the sort of strategy which the masters of today are reluctant to adopt. The struggle for the centre is a characteristic feature of all present-day openings, and the centralization of the pieces is an important theme of modern positional play; as a result, a majority on the wing appears nowadays more as a by-product of a particular strategy than its primary aim (for example, in the Ex- change Variation of the Griinfeld Defence). Thus, concern for the centre is driving majority actions out of use, and it should be added that an indirect defence against an attack on the castled king is more effective and holds better prospects of success in the form of a central ac- tion than one using wing pawns. This is shown by the following general consid- erations. 1) Advancing pawns on the opposite wing is a slow process, since, as a rule, the whole pawn chain must move forward for a passed pawn to be created. 2) The attacker knows which pawn is going to be dangerous and so can ar- range to contain it economically, either by preparing to block the pawn with a Defending against the attack on the castled king 265 piece or by planning ahead to sacrifice a piece for the passed pawn, which in fact means surrendering the piece in return for a considerable number of tempi. 3) Advancing pawns on the opposite wing is an action which is furthest in distance from the threatened castled position and which is the hardest to combine with, or transform into, direct defence. These are the general deficiencies of indirect defence using the wing pawns, and they limit its use mainly to the following cases: a) The attack on the castled king develops slowly, demanding a regrouping or perhaps a series of pawn moves; it does not lead to a forced mate, for a defence can be bought at the price of material; b) Direct defence is on the whole sufficient but it may be usefully combined with something else; in other words, the defender has some tempi left over which he can devote to alternative actions, including those using the wing pawns. These, then, are the general factors which speak for, or against, indirect de- fence by means of the wing pawns, but in this case too the reader must overcome any inclination to think merely in terms of formulae, since the essence of a for- mula often consists of 'exceptions which prove the rule'. Defence by counterattack Venturing further into the broad field of indirect defence, we next concern our- selves with a series of cases in which methods other than a pawn thrust in the cen- tre are used. We shall examine five examples from the point of view of the following factors: 1 ) The area of the counterattack and the conditions underlying it. 2) The part played by the material situation in relation to positional consider- ations. 3) The interweaving of indirect defence with direct and the switching from one to the other. 4) The dependence of timing and the form of defence on the state of the at- tacker's commitments. The following position is from the game K.Treybal-H.Wolf, Teplitz-Schonau
1922. Black, to move, has the task of organizing a defence against an attack on
his king position. A single glance is enough to show that he has no move to make in the way of direct defence. The only move in keeping with that would be l... h7, but that would simply make White's attack easier. For example, White will in any case play Sf4-h4 and then (with the king on h7) the square g5 will be available for his queen, besides which there is a threat of JLcl followed by Sxh6
S3
266 The Art of Attack in Chess
with check. Therefore, indirect defence must be used to obstruct White's plan to gain control of h6. With that aim, only an action on the queenside can be consid- ered, for Black cannot achieve anything in the centre.
1...a5 2 Sf4 a4 3 Safi axb3 4 axb3 JXa2!
Very well played! Black first of all makes it difficult for White to redeploy his queen and bishop, a course which is necessary for an attack on h6; moreover, there is an eventual threat of ...2xb2 followed by ...Nd3.
5 Sh4 Sb8
Suddenly Black threatens 6...#}xc4; he has worked up a definite counterat- tack, and White is still quite a long way from having any serious threats on the kingside. 6 c3 Black has succeeded in persuading White's queen to leave the attacking diag- onal. 6 fixh6 would not have worked because of 6...Hxb2 7 Rg5 Rg4 and White has nothing. An interesting possibility was 6 Nf5, which probably leads to a draw; objectively, this would not have been at all bad, for Black could have gained some advantage after White's actual move. The analysis runs 6 £rf5 gxf5 (6...Sxb2 fails against 7 £}xh6+ .xh6 8 Rxh6) 7 Sxh6 Exb2 8 Rg5+ 4£Ag6 9 Sxg6+ fxg6 10 Rxg6+ <£118 11 Sf4 (this attempt does not give more than perpet- ual check, which White would also obtain by 11 Rh5+) 1 l...fibl+ 12 £?f2 Sb2+ 13 <£el Sbl+ (if 13...Rxe4+ 14 Uxe4 fxe4, White wins by 15 f7!) 14 Nd2 Sb2+ 15 <£cl Sbl+! 16 £*xbl Sxb3+ 17 <£*a2 262+' 18 <Na3 (or 18 <Nxb2 Re5+ and
19...'Nxf4) 18...Sa2+, and White's king cannot escape from perpetual check.
6...6xc4?
1 Black can play for a win by 17...fih3! since after 18 gxh3 xc4+ he can win the
rook on f4 with a series of checks. Defending against the attack on the castled king 261 The wrong turning, since White now plays JLcl with gain of tempo, placing the bishop on the diagonal where it really belongs. The correct continuation of the defence consisted in giving, not taking, material, e.g. 6,..Sxb2! 7 Rxb2 <2)xc4 8 Rc3 (or 8 Wcl Ne5 9 Sxh6 Sxb3 after which both 10 Rg5 Rg4 and 10 Sf5 <2)g4 are in Black's favour) 8...£te5 9 Sbl c4 10 b4 Rxf6 11 Sh3 -&.g7 and Black has the better prospects. Wolf, of course, was not the master to decide on 'giving' when he could 'take'. His saying was: 'Why should I sacrifice when no- body sacrifices for me!?' But the consistent implementation of a plan with a sound positional basis often demands sacrificial conceptions, as in the analysis above, which is both typical and instructive. We can see here how an element of direct defence is also involved - the elimination of White's bishop, which plays an essential part in his mating plans. White's attack then flags, whereupon Black takes some pawns, centralizes his position, and brands White's rook on h4 as misplaced; the defence welds the various elements of the position into a single whole. 7 &cl (D)
7...Ne5
In sharp positions like this everything should be considered, including moves like 7...g5. The latter represents a simultaneous combination of direct and indi- rect defence: Black drives back the rook, blocks the diagonal of the enemy bishop, and frees the square g6 for the knight - all direct elements - while the in- direct appears in certain continuations where Black's g-pawn takes part in a counterattack. Let us look at some ways in which White can go astray after
7...g5. First of all, the 'natural' move 8 Sh5? is unsatisfactory because of 8...€ e5

At the very least, this is a tactical mistake; for, by 8...Sxb3 Black could have presented White with an exceptionally difficult problem and involved him in considerable risk if he persisted in playing for a win. The text move, however, gives White no difficulties and allows him to win easily. Griinfeld and Becker, the authors of the tournament book - one of the best in the literature of the game - rightly censure Black's move, but their analysis of the continuation 8...Sxb3! is not correct. In the variation which they conclude with a drawn ending Black can eventually win, while in that which they consider won for Black the position can be resolved in White's favour. These lines together with my analysis will interest the reader as general studies of the middlegame. Here is a diagram after the alternative 8...Sxb3! (D). Griinfeld and Becker reach a draw as follows: 9 jlxf8 g5 ! (otherwise J&.g7 and mate) 10 Sh5 Sxc3 1 1 -Ng7 £}g6 12 £}f5. In their opinion Black now has no de- fence against perpetual check by i?Jh6+. In fact, Black still has something to say and can play 12...Sxg2+! 13 ?hl (if 13 xg2 then 13...Rxe4+ and Black has no Defending against the attack on the castled king 269 trouble picking up the rook on h5) 13...Sxh2+ 14 Nxh2 (or 14 Sxh2 Rxe4+ fol- lowed by ...Nh4) 14...Re5+ 15 &gl Sg3+ 16 h2 (16 Nxg3 Rxg3+ 17 hl Rg4 followed by ...Rxe4+, ...c4, etc.) 16...Sf3+ 17 *gl (or 17 Ng2 Sxf5 18 exf5 Re2+ 19 Sf2 Nf4+) 17...Sxfl+ 18 xfl Rf4+ and White loses either his rook or his knight. The second line given by the same commentators aims to show that 8...Sxb3! cannot be answered by 9 Wcl because of 9... g4 10 Bxf8 Sbb2 11 Jkg7 Sxg2+ 12 &hl Sxh2+ 13 2xh2 Sxh2+ 14 ?gl Ra2 and Black wins. But if White, in- stead of 11 .g7?, plays 1 1 xb2! Sxb2 12 .g7 then Black loses. Correct after 9 Rc1 is at once 9...Sbb2 whereupon 10 Jtxf8 does not work because of 10...fixg2+ 11 &hl 4£"g4!. Now here is my analysis. First of all, let me explain why 9 Bxf8? g5 ! 10 Wcl, not mentioned by the commentators, does not work. Black replies 10...gxh4 and then 11 Rh6 is useless on account of ll...Rg4 while 11 Rg5+ fails against 1 l...<Nxf8 12 £}f5 Sbb2! when White's attack is halted - he cannot get any fur- ther than Rh6+ and £}g7+ because of the threat of mate that faces him on g2 and h2. A third possibility is 11 Nf5 Sbb2! 12 e7+ Rxe7 13 Rg5+ (if 13 Rxb2 then 13...Re6) 13... ?xf8 14 fxe7+ e8 when it can be seen that White has achieved nothing. In return for his rooks Black will win the queen and the pawns on g2 and e7, thus obtaining an advantage in the ending. The above diagram is a hard nut to crack, and the way to attempt it is as fol- lows: 9 Wcl! Sbb2! 10 Rxb2! 2xb2 11 .xf8 g5 12 Hh5 Ng6 13 Jlg7. Now White has the same position as in the first line above but with a tempo less and a rook more. He wins in the following variations: 1) 13...c4 14 f5 Sxg2+ (otherwise Ne7+ wins) 15 <Nxg21 Rxe4+ 16 g3 Re5+ 17 hS g4+ (if 17...Rc3+ the king escapes from the checks on gl) 18 <Ng2 Rb2+ 19 #gl Rb6+ 20 Sf2!

20 Sh7#) 19 Sh6 Sal 20 f7+ xg7 21 Sxg6+ xg6 22 f8W and again White
wins. 1 15 111' wins straight away.
270 The Art of Attack in Chess
Of Black's other moves the most difficult to deal with is 13...Rc4, threatening
14...Rc2. White is then able to draw by 14 Sal Sa2 15 Sbl Sb2 ! 16 Sal etc., but
can he also win? This may be left to the reader to examine; we shall return to the game, where Black played 8...jtxh6? (D).
9 Sxh6 Rxb3
Black also loses after 9...Sxb3 10 Wcl £}g4 11 Rg5! Sbb2 12 Sxg6+.

Now the main defect in Black's eighth move can be seen: White is at once threatening 11 Bh8+.

1 In this line 15... d4+ 16 &hl Sal wins for Black - indeed, White seems to be
struggling after 13...Rc4. Defending against the attack on the castled king 271 This position, from the game Yates-Marco, The Hague 1921, arose after the moves 1 e4 e5 2 Nf3 d6 3 d4 S)d7 4 M4 c6 5 Sk3 M7 6 O-O h6 7 M3 £}gf<5 8 M3 c7 9 Nd2 g5 10 a4 Nf8 11 a5 2>g6 12 Sei 2>f4 13 f3 Sg8 14 2ifl M6
15 Ng3 (D), Black has played his favourite Hanham Variation of the Philidor,
obtaining the advantage and an attack on the white king; this is the natural result of White's extravagant treatment of the opening (unmotivated moves an earlier stage of the game). Marco (Black), to move, spoils his position by pro- voking d5 which he does in order to continue with a sacrifice in the old 'paprika style'.
15...Rd7?
Black had excellent prospects of carrying out an attack using his pawns (15...g4 or 15.. .h5) without any material risk, but he has seen the chance of a bishop sacrifice on h3 with play against the focal-point g2 and cannot resist it. 16 d5 White rightly falls in with Black's intentions and forces him to continue with
...M3.
16...M3 (D)
A
and f3 at 17 gxh3? White decides to accept the sacrifice and to employ direct defence against the attack on his king. With good play he could certainly have come through by this method, but the right way to refute the offer is not by accepting it but by applying indirect defence in the shape of a counterattack on the queenside. After d5 there is also some point to the earlier advance a5, since an attack can now be made on Black's pawn chain at b7 and c6, as a result of which White obtains the better pawn structure and an advantage in space on the queenside and also frees the square d5 for a centralized piece. The analysis runs 17 a6! Nxg2 (if 17... Jlxg2
272 The Art of Attack in Chess
then 18 axb7 Rxb7 19 Ba4 when White wins the exchange and gains space, while if Black advances his b-pawn, then 18 dxc6 Rc8 represents a strengthen- ing of White's position, after which the conditions for accepting the sacrifice are extremely good) 18 axb7 Rxb7 19 dxc6 (if 19 Ba4 as mentioned by Tartakower in The Hypermodern Game, Black would reply 19... xe3 20 Sxe3 .d7)
19...Rc8 20 Nd5! (a typical example of play on the principle that the most im-
portant feature of the position, in this case White's pressure on the queenside, takes priority; it should be observed that in pursuing this policy White must also be prepared to lose the exchange) 2O...Nxel (it might seem more consistent for Black not to make this capture but to press on with his assault; in fact, the chief attacking moves do not work, e.g. 20...h5 21 £jxf6+ and 22 Nxh5, 20...g4 21 Nxe7 Nxe7 22 and White stands better and finally 2O...Nxd5 21 jlxd5 af- ter which 21...Rc7, to prevent the advance of the c-pawn, is strongly answered by 22 b4) 21 Wxel A.e6 (Black must abandon his attack on the king and defend himself in the centre and on the queenside; the decisive factor is that 21. ..g4 is useless because of 22 f4) 22 a5 Bxd5 23 Jtxd5 #)xd5 24 Rxd5 Re6 (other- wise c7!) 25 b4! and White has an overwhelming game. The chief feature of this line is the complete absence of direct defence. White gives up the pawn on g2 and the exchange, which effectively blunts Black's at- tack, while his excellently-founded action on the queenside gains in power with every move. 17".Rxh3 (D)
18 Rd2?
After this excessively passive move Black has the better chances. In such posi- tions it is often important to oppose the attacker's queen with one's own - in this case on fl. It was with this aim that Maroczy proposed 18 Se2! g4 19 Wfl. Defending against the attack on the castled king 273 Naturally, White gladly offers the exchange in order to weaken the attack by giv- ing back some material while at the same time still retaining some material ad- vantage. Thus after 19...gxf3 20 Rxf3 <Nxe2+ 21 £}xe2 Black's only move to prevent White from consolidating completely is 21...l$3g4, but then White imme- diately gets the chance to counterattack, i.e. 22 dxc6! Rxh2+ 23 ?fl Nxe3+ 24 Rxe3. The further sharpening of the attack by 24... .h4 would be dangerous be- cause of 25 cxb7. We shall examine two more variations arising out of 19...gxf3 20 Rxf3 (D): 1) 20...£}6h5 21 Bxf4! exf4 22 dxc6. Black cannot win a piece now, since
22.. .fxg3? permits the white queen to capture on f7, while 22... xg3 can be met
by 23 2g2. Black must be modestand play 22...bxc6, allowing White to consoli- date by 23 Hg2. The risk involved in 22...O-O-O is illustrated by the continuation 23 £k!5 ! xg3 (23...fxg3 24 Rf5+ Rxf5 25 xe7+ b8 26 exf5 favours White) 24 2xe7+ Nb8 25 Sg2 Ne2+ 26 Rxe2 f3 27 c7+ Nxc7 28 £ki5+ <Nb8 29 Nf4!, with a characteristic switch from indirect to direct defence; after 29...Sxg2+ 30 Rxg2 White captures the pawn on f3 and remains the better placed 1!. 2) 2O...2g4 (covering the square f4, lessening the danger on f7, and preparing ...h5-h4) 21 a6! (logically switching to the positional motif on the queenside and thus exploiting the slower tempo of Black's attack betrayed by the move ...Sg4)
21...b6 (after 21...O-O-O? 22 axb7+ bS 23 dxc6 Black would be in great difficul-
ties) 22 dxc6 h5 23 hl ! (having made good his superiority on the queen's wing, White goes over to direct defence; he returns the extra piece in order to simplify into a favourable ending) 23...h4 (Black would recover less material by 23,..Nxe2 24 £3cxe2, since then 24. ,.h4 is met by 25 Wfl, when White clarifies the position

274 The Art of Attack in Chess
at the further expense of his e-pawn) 24 Bxf4 exf4 (the alternative 24...fixf4 25 Rg2 is equally in White's favour) 25 Wfl Sxg3 26 Rxh3 2xh3 27 g2 f3+ 28 ?xh3 fxe2 29 Sei with a clear advantage to White. Now we return to the game after 18 Rd2 (D).
18...&6h5?
Commentators have praised this move, which, however, could have allowed White to escape. Correct was 18...h5! which excludes the possibility of simplifi- 2 cation and wins back the piece without giving up the attack . 19Wf2? White misses the chance to liquidate the position which Maroczy pointed out: 19 £}xh5! Rxf3 20 dLxf4 (forced) 2O...gxf4+ 21 Bg3 fxg3 22 h3! and Black's attack loses its power. He must be satisfied with winning the exchange by
22... f2+23 Rxf2 gxf2+ 24 Nxf2 Jlh4+ 25 62 Jilxel 263xel with a probable
draw.
19...g4 20 &hl
Interesting is 20<Nxh5 £jxh5 21 Rg2 (or 21 f4 g3 !) 21...gxf3! 22 Rxg8+ d7 when White's queen has not a single square on the g-file from which to defend g2.

1 This is still not totally clear after 25...Sxg3 26 Nxg3 g4, but White can im-
prove earlier by 25 < g 1! Sxg3 26 Rxg3 with an instant win.
2 I do not see how this wins back the piece. White can play (amongst other prom-
ising ideas) 19 Jlc4 h4 20 Bf1 Rd7 21 dxc6 bxc6 22 Nf5, and Black has noth- ing to show for his sacrifice. Defending against the attack on the castled king 275 Or 26 Exa8 Ng3 27 h3 Nxf4.
26.. .Nf8 27 Exf7+ Nxf7 28 dxc6+ Ng7 29 Ne6+ h8 30 <Nd5 bxc6 0-1
This game won the Second Brilliancy Prize. In this position Black is to move and must discover a defence against White's two threats of 4jh5 and 33f5. It is fairly easy to reach the conclusion that there is not a large choice; only two moves are worth considering - l...f5 and l... h8. The first appears more natural than the second, but in fact only the second pro- vides an adequate defence. If l...f5?, White replies 2 Bxf5!, after which 2...Sxf5 does not work because of 3 Nxf5 gxf5 4 Rg5+ <Nf7 5 Rf6+ e8 (or 6 Sf3) 6 e6, and Black loses; nor is 2...gxf5 satisfactory, e.g. 3 <2hh5 Ed7 4 e6, when the rook is lost, since if 4...Ee7. then 5 Sf3 is decisive; the one course re- maining, therefore, is to decline the sacrifice by 2... e7, but then White plays 3 Bd3, threatening f5 as well as Nh5.
1...f5? is weak because it 'opens up the position', with the result that White's
queen becomes even more effective and is always creating new threats. On the other hand, l...'Nh8, which is also primarily a form of direct defence, should en- able Black, provided he can survive the immediate pressure, to make good his material advantage and territorial superiority on the queenside. Let us now exam- ine this second move.
1... h8! 2 Nf5
After 2 £}h5 Sg8 3 (otherwise 3...Bf8!) 3...Sg7 4 Sf3 Black can just de- fend himself in time by 4...Rc3 5 Sdl .e7 and if 6 Hh3, then 6... .xf6.
2.. .Eg8 3 Ef3 gxf5
Forced, since even 3...jLf8 does not prevent White from sacrificing his queen on h7 and mating with the rook on the h-file.
4 Eh3 Eg7 5 Nxf5 (D)
276 The Art of Attack in Chess
Now White threatens 6 Bxh7 and 7 Ag6+ followed by mate with the queen at h8, but Black is a knight up at this stage, so the possibility of defence by giving back material arises. As a result of this increase in his resources, Black's defence turns suddenly from direct to indirect, only in the end to return again, after the 'detour', to direct defence. 5,..Rd2! 6 g3 If 6 Eg3, then 6...Sdg8; anything else is answered by the same manoeuvre as now follows.
6...Nxe3 7 Nxh7 Nxf4! 8 Rh5
Or 8 Rxf4 xf4 9 Jtf5+ g8 10 gxf4 <Nd4 1 1 jld3 c5, when Black stands better.
8.. Bh6 9 £jxe5 10 Rxh6+ Rxh6 11 Exh6+ <Ng8 and Black has a win-
ning advantage1. In this example too we observe how a successful defence is flexible and unites a diversity of elements. Direct and indirect defence alternate, the attacker's Although Vukovic is correct with his general principles, the above example is hardly a convincing demonstration; whatever Black plays, he cannot hope to defend the position with most of his pieces stuck far away on the queenside. Af- ter l.-. hS White can play 2 f5! Nxe5 3 Nh5 Hg8 4 fxg6 fxg6 5 Rg5! Nd7 6 fif7 with a decisive attack, for example 6...Rc3 7 Sdl £df8 8 fixd7 xd3 9 Re5+ and mates. Moreover, even one of Vukovic's own lines favours White: after 2 Nh5 Sg8 3 Hg7 4 Sf3 Rc3 5 Ed 1 jLe7 White need not allow the capture on f6 but can simply play 6 Rh4! threatening 7 Eh3. Black has nothing better than 6...h5 7 Rg5 Jtxf6 8 exf6 Eh7 9 f5 Re5, but after 10 h4! he is clearly in serious trouble as his rook on h7 is totally out of play. Defending against the attack on the castled king 277 sacrifice provokes a counter-sacrifice from the defender, and in the end the basic soundness of Black's position proves itself. This position is from the game Rossolimo-Pachman, Hilversum 1947. It is Black's move; he has a promising game and ought really to continue along posi- tional lines, e.g. I...a5 2 a4 e4 3 We 2 b6, etc. Instead, he decides to 'invest his ad- vantage in an attack on the king', though the conditions for this are not particularly suitable.
1...f41? 2 exf4 exf4 3 c5!
Black opened his attack at the cost of his advantage in the centre. Now White, by ridding himself of his doubled pawns, eliminates the last element of Black's positional superiority, with the result that the latter has only his kingside attack left.
3...Rf7 4 Be4
As a general rule, the fianchettoed bishop protecting the castled position should not be touched, but here it is a question of gaining a tempo in order to play cxd6 before £M2. If at once 4 cxd6, Black replies 4...f3, attacking the bishop on g2.
4...Rh5
If 4...f3, White is not obliged to go in for the double-edged 5 .xh7+. He also has 5 cxd6 cxd6 6 £ki2 Bg4 7 Rc4, forcing the exchange of queens. 5 cxd6 cxd6 Black's position is not strong enough for the uncompromising 5...f3 6 £k!2 J&.g4. White would continue 7 Sabi, not allowing his opponent to escape from his material commitments; at the same time, he has a direct defence at hand in the shape of an attack on Black's queen by Sb5. After, for instance, 7...Sf6 8 Sxb7 Black's obligations are too great in proportion to the force of his attack.
278 The Art of Attack in Chess
Consequently, if 8...Sh6, White can permit himself 9 h4, a weakening which does not entail danger, since 9...g5 can be countered by 10 Eb5. If instead
8...Rh3, then 9 *53x1'3 Bxf3 (otherwise *53h4 and Jkg2) 10 Bxf3 Eh6 11 Eel
leads to a win for White. 6 *53d2 Now ...1'3 is no longer possible.
6...Ef6 7 Bf3 i.g4(D)
8 Bxg4?
This exchange involves the loss of a tempo. White should have switched at once to a counterattack on the queenside, where he is the better placed, for exam- ple 8 Sabi! Eh6 9 h4. Then, as we saw above, 9...g5 does not work, nor does
9...a6 because of 10 Exb7 g5 11 Rc4+. Lastly, there is 9...d5 10 Exb7, and again
10. ,.g5 is insufficient since after 11 Bxd5+ h8 12 Bf7 .e2 13 Rf5 White
wins. This is an example of how indirect defence, by clearing the ground on the queenside, makes it easier to revert to direct defence at the critical moment.
8.. .Rxg4 9 Rf3 Rh3 10 £3e4?'
Here too 10 Sabi would probably have been better.
10.. .Eh6 11 Rg2 Rh5 12 g4
After a period of timid play White aims to save himself by blocking the posi- tion.
12...Rh4 13 Sabi Eg6?I
This move and, in particular, the next, are not the best. Black should have played 13...Ee8 14 Efel (otherwise ...Exe4) 14...Ee7, which would have en- abled him to retain a slight advantage.
14 h3 h5?
Defending against the attack on the castled king 279 Admittedly, this forces f3, which shuts the long diagonal to White's queen, but on the other hand, it undertakes an attacking obligation for which there is insuffi- cient justification. The point is that Black is obliged to obtain some concrete ad- vantage before his pawn at h5 becomes an anxiety and he is forced to strengthen White's position by exchanging it on g4. After this mistake White is the better placed and should in the end make his presence felt on the queenside.
15 f3 Na5 (D)
16 Nh2
Though this does not mar White's position much, it would have been stronger to have played 16 Sb5! 4)c4 17 W2!, when Black's discomfort over the h-pawn is revealed in various ways. Thus, 17...Rxf2+ 18 Bxf2 hxg4 19 fxg4 leaves two pawns en prise, one of which will obviously fall, while if 17...Rxh3, then 18 Ng5 Rg3+ (or 18...Sxg5 19 Sxg5 hxg4 20 Rh2 Rxh2+ 21 Nxh2 22 Sbl gxf3 23 < ?gl is good for White) 19 Rxg3 fxg3 20 gxh5 a6 21 hxg6 axb5 22 Sei and White is the better placed. This line, wherein the union of direct and indirect defence is especially close, would have been a much better way of handling the position than the passive one actually chosen.
16...&C4 17 Sgl?
The decisive error. He should have played 17 Rf2; then 17...Re7 (17...Rxf2+ eventually loses a pawn) 18 gxh5 Sh6 19 Sgl Sxh5 20 Sxb7! Sxh3+ (or
20... xb7 21 Nf6+) 21 xh3 Rxb7 22 Rh4 leaves the advantage with White.
1 21...£k!2! leads to a rook and pawn ending which is winning for Black. White can improve earlier in this variation, but only to the extent of holding the bal- ance. It is therefore doubtful if 16 Sb5 was any stronger than the move played.
280 The Art of Attack in Chess
17.. .d5! 18 Re2
This loses material, but even the more stubborn 18 Nc5 would not help much1. The deciding point here is that 18 Rf2 does not work because of 18...Rxf2+ 19 xf2 £jd2 !, and White loses the exchange.
18.. .hxg4 19 fxg4 Ee6 20 Rf2 Re7 21 Sxb7 Rxb7 22 21c5 Se7 23 Nxe6
#xe6 24 Rxf4 Hf8 25 Rg3 d2 0- 1 In this position White played: lSe3 He is clearly preparing to deploy the rook on g3 or h3 in order to attack the op- posing king. Moves of this type belong on the whole to a rather more advanced stage of the game, when all the other pieces have been developed; they are also good in closed positions, where the opponent has no chance of counterattacking on an open file. However, even here this sortie on the part of the rook does not en- tail a very serious commitment for White, since the rook can turn back if it does not succeed in its mission.
1...&C6 2 Hg3 Nh8
This parries the threat of 3 Bh6 without weakening the castled position.
2... .e4 3 Bh6 .g6 is not so good because of 4 Jlxg6 hxg6 5 J e3, when White
has attacking chances along the h-file. Black is still applying prophylactic direct defence, since the conditions are not yet favourable for a counterattack; the exchange of light-squared bishops ought to lessen the force of the attack and at the same time clear the squares on the c-file for an eventual counterattack.
1 Actually White can resign after the reply 18...Ne3.
Defending against the attack on the castled king 281
4 Sh3?I
This threatens Bxe4 followed by Rh5, but it does not take sufficient account of temporal factors, with the result that the initiative now passes to Black. It would have been better to contest the c-file by 4 Sc 1.
4...W5 5 f3
The second logical step along a dangerous path: if the attack does not succeed, White will obviously suffer from the lack of communication between his rooks.
5..Bxd3 6 Rxd3 (D)

6...jLd6?
Up to here Black has correctly carried through a direct defence without weak- ening his pawn position, at the same time keeping his trumps in reserve (the c-file and control of the central post at d5). All this has been entirely appropriate to the fairly modest commitments taken on by White. Now he mistakenly supposes that the moment for a counterattack has arrived and makes a careless move, which White could have punished. The situation required direct defence to be contin- ued for one more move, namely, by a renewed consolidation of the king's posi- tion by 6... ?g8. The reason is that Black may eventually be forced (by $Lg5) to play ...g6, after which Jlh6 would threaten the rook protecting f7. This point can be covered by the king after ...'i&gS; consequently, Black may then use both his rooks on the c-file, while retaining a sufficient direct defence of the castled posi- tion by ...g6, if necessary. 6...h6 would be weaker on account of 7 g4, while
6...fic7 is also incorrect, e.g. 7 h6 8 .f4 followed by g4.
7&f4? This throws away the chance of victory which was afforded by 7 £}d7!. Owing to the threat of Nxf6, Black loses the exchange. He is not helped by 7...Nxh2+ 8 Sxh2! (not 8 xh2? Rxd7 9 Bg5, since Black defends himself by 9...Rc7+ and

Black was threatening 8...£}h5; if 8 Bh6, Black can of course reply 8..Bxe5.
8.. .5c7 9 Re3 Sfc8
Black's counterattack is growing rapidly in strength. This is not a defensive move but a preparation for later action against the bishop by means of ...h6. 12Sg3 White concedes that his attack has been beaten off and tries to provide some resistance on the second rank. After 12 Bf6+ Nxf6 13 exf6 Rc5 Black has the better ending.

Rxh4# If one leaves aside Black's unpunished mistake on the sixth move, then the whole course of the game is a good illustration of the relationship between the scale of the attacker's commitment and the method of defence employed. In the first phase White is not heavily committed by his rook's excursion and Black car- ries out a cautious direct defence without compromising his king position. He also maintains his hold on the c-file and the centre and eliminates one enemy unit - the light-squared bishop. With f3 and g4 White has already taken on greater ob- ligations and so the time is ripe for indirect defence by means of an action along the c-file. As soon as another unit is eliminated (the knight on e5) it is all over with White's attack, whereas the counterattack grows from move to move, with White has an even simpler win by 7 JLgS!, after which Black must surrender a piece to avoid being mated on h7. Defending against the attack on the castled king 283 the lack of communication between the white rooks as the main cause of White's misfortune. Defence by a central thrust Attacks on the castled king in which the situation in the centre does not play a greater or lesser part are extremely rare, and as a rule it is precisely the soundness of the attacker's central formation which provides the basis for his attack. If this formation is not sound enough, the defender may use indirect defence against it in the first instance, aimed against the central formation's most vulnerable point. Why is it that the centre is quite so important and sensitive in the particular case of an attack on the castled king? Because this kind of attack is one of the most complex and many-sided operations in chess, demanding the maximum collaboration of the pieces and a control over all possible consequences right up to the endgame. The centre is the most versatile area on the chessboard; it pro- vides the best conditions for the full co-operation of the pieces - the basis on which positional play is founded and a prerequisite for a favourable endgame. Many-sidedness is the common property belonging to a sound attack on the cas- tled king and to the centre, and this accounts for their mutual interdependence. Correct defence must also be many-sided - this we have seen in the last series of examples - and so each Tittle crack in the centre' is more important to the de- fence than a variety of other weaknesses on the attacker's side. In some of the examples so far we have seen the centre acting as the basis of an attack, while in others the defender has employed indirect defence based on de- stroying the attacker's centre by sacrificing a piece. We have noticed particularly the case where the defender strives to centralize his pieces - giving a position which as a rule makes possible a combination of direct defence and the indirect form on the other flank. It still remains for us to look at the case of defence by means of a pawn thrust against the attacker's central formation. Before we pass on to examples, we must be clear that we are concerned here with a central thrust of a particular kind. For why should such a thrust be signifi- cant just at the critical phase of the attack? Why did the player not employ it ear- lier? The point is precisely that we are dealing here with cases where in fact the central thrust is not useful before the crisis, because the attacker has good replies to it. Only when he has increased his commitments and deployed his pieces for the attack does the moment for a thrust in the centre arise; and very often this oc- curs at a precise, given moment, not a move earlier or later. The following famous game provides a good example of a defensive thrust in the centre.
284 The Art of Attack in Chess
Alekhine - Botvinnik Nottingham, 1936 Sicilian Defence, Dragon Variation Nb3 i.e6 9 f4 O-O 10 g4 (D ) In choosing the pawn avalanche as a means of attacking the castled king at an early stage of the game, White has undertaken a considerable obligation to carry out his attack incisively to the end. For if Black has his say, his counterattack will find a mass of weak points, files, and diagonals in White's territory; if an end- game is reached, White's advanced pawns may easily become 'cannon-fodder'. The moment of undertaking an obligation is also the moment of crisis, the mo- ment for the thrust in the centre, which in the Sicilian as a whole, and in this posi- tion particularly, is unstable. Botvinnik perceived the correct moment and struck with 10...d5!.
10...d5!
Let us first see why ...d5 is correct at the precise moment when White plays g4. Let us suppose he has played 10 O-O and examine the difference. 1) 10 O-O d5? 11 e5 Ne8 (11...d4 does not work, since White can simply take the pawn) 12 .f3 Nc7 13 Nc5, when Black must accept the weakening of his position by Nxe6 fxe6, since 13...d4 is defeated by 14 .xc6. 2) 10 g4 d5! 11 e5 d4! (now this move is good) 12 £}xd4 (or 12 exf6 Bxf6, when Black wins the piece back with the better game) 12...4bxd4 13 Jtxd4 Nxg4! 14 .xg4 Jlxg4, and Black preserves the material balance while gaining the advantage with regard to space, position, and time. There is undoubtedly a great difference between the first and second instances of ...d5. Defending against the attack on the castled king 285 Now the question arises why ...d5! is necessary in answer to 10 g4 and what happens if Black does not employ the defensive central thrust. This can be an- swered by citing the continuation of the game Foltys-Eliskases, Podebrad 1936, where in the same position Black met 10 g4 with 10...Na5 aiming at the square c4. The continuation was 11 g5 12 Bd4 (in the game Kan-Botvinnik, Mos- cow, 1936, 12 Rd2 was played, but Foltys' move is better) 12...Sc8 13 h4 Nc4
14 Nxc4 Sxc4 15 Rd3 Sc8 16 O-O-O Rd7 17 Sd2 Ng4 (to combat h5, but it sur-
renders d5 to the enemy knight) 18 £ki5 b6 19 f5 ! (the avalanche begins to move; Black cannot take the pawn, since the eventual Nxe7+ is decisive) 19...e6 20 Nxg7 >xg7 21 f6+ <Nh8 22 2te7 Sd8 23 Nd4 Ra4 24 £bl Nc7 25 h5 gxh5 26 Sdh2 Sd7 27 e5 (threatening 28 Rxh7+ xh7 29 Sxh5+ mating) 27...Sxe7 28 Sxh5 Bxh5 29 Sxh5 1-0 Now to return to the Nottingham game, in which Botvinnik did not allow him- self to be smothered in this way. 11 f5 Clearly, this is the only alternative to 11 e5 which has already been analysed. If 11 exd5 €jxd5 12 Nxd5, Black would gladly exchange queens by 12...Rxd5, thus winning the b-pawn, to say nothing of the ending. Il...Nc8 Though the bishop has to withdraw, it is still aggressively placed as far as White's weak pawns at f5 and g4 are concerned. 12 exd5 £}b4 There is to be no more talk of an attack on the king; the players are now con- cerned with a struggle for the centre pawn and the d5-square. If White holds out, he can expect success, but if Black overcomes the advancing pawn, the first player's prospects are poor. 13 d6? (D) Whenever Alekhine made an unexpected move the world of commentators dutifully gave it one or two exclamation marks. This happened in the case of this move too, which abandons the struggle for the square d5 and, in fact, also risks losing the game. A better line here is 13 ji.f3! gxf5 14 a3 fxg4 15 .g2. Suggested long ago by Dr Euwe, this was tried in the 2nd match game between Fischer and Reshevsky, New York 1961 when White secured an advantage after 15...Na6 16 Rd3 e6 17 O-O-O Nxd5 18 h3 g3 19 Hhgl Rd6 20 Nxd5 exd5 21 Nxd5 <Nh8 22 Nf4 Rg6. Now Fischer played 23 Rd2 but 23 Rf3! seems to me to be even stronger.
13...Rxd6?
Alekhine's original assertion that 13...exd6! was impossible because of 14 a3 £te6 15 g5 £}e8? 16 f6 etc., has remained unchallenged in chess literature. It is
286 The Art of Attack in Chess
clear, however, that in this kind of situation it is worth looking to see whether the sacrifice of a piece will work or not. Indeed, sound logic argues that it must work, for the whole variation quoted by Alekhine so strengthens Black's position that it is worth his giving up a knight for two pawns. Above all, White's position is exposed as a result of his pawn advances: the thrust d6 leaves him without a 'backbone' in the centre; the reply ...exd6 opens up the e-file and the diagonal d8-h4, while g5 relinquishes control of the c8-h3 diagonal to Black's c8-bishop. The sacrifice can take a number of forms, but I shall give the one which seems best to me. It runs 13...exd6! 14 a3 <Nc6 15 g5 Se8! with the following possibili- ties: 1) 16 gxf6 Sxe3 17 fxg7 (or 17 Nd5 Se5 18 fxg7 Rh4+ 19 sS?f1 Nxf5! and Blackhas a strong attack) 17... h4+ 18 d2 (or 18 <&fl Bxf5) 18...Rh6 19 el and Black has excellent chances. He has no need to consent to a draw by
19...Rh4+ 20 Nd2 Rh6, but can play for a win with 19...Bxf5.
2) 16 Bd4 Nxd4 17 xd4 Ng4 18 f6 Nxf6 19 gxf6 Rxf6 20 Sfl Rh4+ 21 Nd2 <Ne3 22 f3 Rh6 and Black wins. 3) 16 Xf2 e4 17 4jxe4 (or 17 f6 Nxc3 18 bxc3 .g4 19 cl Ra5 20 .d4 Nxd4 21 Rxd4 Rxg5 22 fxg7 Nxe2 23 Nxe2 Rg2 and Black wins) 17...2xe4

Rb5+ 24 Ne2 (alternatives are 24 d3 Rd5 and 24 Rd3 Rxg5) 24...Se4 25 fxg7 Sxe2 26 Rxe2 Wbl+ with advantage to Black. Botvinnik must certainly have prepared the move 10...d5 ! in his private analy- sis and so should have known all the important continuations. He had probably not reckoned with 13 d6?, and when Alekhine confronted him with it, did not venture on 13...exd6 but was bluffed into playing the drawing move 13...Rxd6?. All great masters, from Homer onwards, have engaged in a little bluff at times.

This position is from the game Kotov-Keres, Budapest Ct 1950. White's at- tack is extremely dangerous, his main threat being jlbl followed by c2. It is Black's move, and the moment is clearly suitable for a thrust in the centre, where Black has not yet engaged his opponent. Keres decided on 1...d5?, but the correct choice was l...d6!, as we shall see later. Let us first follow the course the game actually took. I...d5? 2 .bl!

288 The Art of Attack in Chess
After l...d5?, what is the outstanding feature of the play? Thanks to this move Black won the pawn on c4, but he neither obtained a proper counterattack nor did he harass White's 'captain in the centre', his pawn on e5. White's attack flowed on unchecked. So the move l...d5? had only the form of a central thrust and, in essence, did not greatly alter the situation. The true central thrust here, which does in fact parry the attack, is l...d6! - this has White's e-pawn as its target. Let us look at the variations that arise from this. I...d6! (D)
2 Jcbl
White could, admittedly, maintain his wedge in the centre by 2 f4, but Black would profit from this in two ways: f4 is closed to White's knight, while the con- tinuation 2...Re8 3 Wdl Bxc4 4 JLbl £3f5 5 Rc2 Rc6 shows that Black also has a tempo more here, since the white queen has needed two moves to reach c2; the combination of these factors turns things in Black's favour.
2.. .dxe5 3 dxe5
Now 3 Rc2 can of course be answered by 3...f5.
3...Re8 4 Rc2 g6 5 Jf4
Or 5 O-O Jtxc4 6 fiel Nb3 7 2a2 Nd4 ! 8 cxd4 Bxa2 9 .xa2 xh4, when White is left with neither an attack nor any compensation for the exchange.
5... 3xc4
The counterattack in the centre by ...d6 has attained its object: now White can- not sustain both his attack and his pawn on e5. He cannot achieve anything by 6 Nh5 <2texe5 7 Bf6 because of 7...£}d3+ 8 dl .b5 9 a4 J"Lxa4 10 Sxa4 Rxa4 and Black wins. If 6 £}xg6 fxg6 7 Jlg3, Black plays 7...Sd8, after which the threats of ...Sd2 and ...£}e3 guarantee him a material advantage. Should White take the g-pawn, then the exchange of queens leads to a won ending for Black. Defending against the attack on the castled king 289 The various continuations which result from the thrust l...d6! provide good examples of the following themes: 1) the destruction of the centre when this centre is essential to the attack; in this case Black also gained space for a counterattack via the centre; 2) liquidating the position to bring about a favourable ending on the basis of the defender's strength in the centre. Particular attention should be paid to those cases where the central thrust does not lead immediately to a decision but merely serves to maintain the tension in the centre. The next example illustrates the significance of this method of de- fence. The diagram below is taken from the game Marshall-Burn, Paris 1900. The opening ran as follows: 1 d4 d5 2 c4 e6 3 £k3 Nf6 4 Bg5 Be7 5 e3 O-O 6 £T3 b6 (nowadays this is usually preceded by ...h6) 7 Bd3 .b7 8 cxd5 exd5 9 Bxf6 (the so-called Albin-Marshall Attack in the Queen's Gambit) 9...Bxf6 10 h4 (D) Here Burn timidly played 10...g6?; this was followed by 11 h5 He8 12 hxg6 hxg6 13 Rc2 -g7? (he should have played 13... g7 and if 14 O-O-O then
14...Sh8) 14 i.xg6 fxg6 15 Rxg6 2)d7 16 Ng5 Rf6 17 Sh8+ Nxh8 18 Rh7#.
In playing 10...g6? Burn probably wished to exclude the possibility of the classic bishop sacrifice; 10...h6? would not have been correct on account of 11 g4. But is the sacrifice really threatened? And has Black no better move to pre- vent it than one which weakens his king position? It is an interesting fact here that there is no threat of a sacrifice at all in the original position, yet, if Black plays 10...Se8 or 10...< d7, it is already, in practice anyway, rather dangerous, al- though it would still really be incorrect. Let us now play Black's most natural move, 10...c5!, and see why the sacrifice is incorrect: 11 -&.xh7+ xh7 12 Ng5+
290 The Art of Attack in Chess
<Nh6! (not 12... g6 because of 13 Rd3+ nor 12...*Ng8 on account of 13 Rh5) 13 £}e2 (White's most incisive move) 13...g6 14 Nf4 .xg5! (otherwise 15 h5 is strong; 14... g7 fails against 15 Nge6+) 15 hxg5+ 3?g7 (if IS.-. xgS then 16 Sh5+ affords good attacking prospects) 16 Sh6 (had Black played ... d7 rather than ...c5 on his tenth move, White would now have a chance with 16 Rg4)
16...SH8!1 (16...Rxg5 allows White to get some material back by 17 5xg6+) 17
Sxg6+ (or 17 Rg4 2xh6 18 gxh6+ h7) 17...fxg6 18 £}e6+ g8 19 4bxd8 Shl+20&d2Sxdl+21 Sxdl Bc8 22 dxc5 23 c6 e8 24 c7 Na6 with ad- vantage to Black. Accordingly, there was no threat of a sacrifice and Burn's 10...g6? simply weakened the position without any necessity; this is always a much more danger- ous thing than a forced weakening, as Tartakower so finely expressed in his Hypermodem. (For compulsion creates antitheses and hence the possibility of counterplay or compensation, while in the case of a voluntary weakening there is only a naked weak spot without compensation!) We shall now examine an example of play from the above diagram, where Black correctly maintains the tension in the centre as a means of defence, while avoiding as much as possible any weakening of his king position.
10...C5 11 g4
White sees that 11 Rc2 g6 12 h5 can be answered by 12...Re8 protecting g6 and threatening ...cxd4. If he then continues with 13 O-O-O Black resolves the central tension and starts an attack on the castled king (by 13. ..c4 14 Be2 b5, etc.) which is stronger than White's. 1 1 Wbl meets a similar response - and White can no longer castle queenside.
11...5.8
Putting pressure on White's d-pawn; now 12 g5 fails against 12...Jlxd4. 12 &fl The pressure in the centre has made White resort to artificial castling.
12...g6 (D)
This weakening is necessary and well-founded here, and therefore not an er- ror. Black perceives the prospects that his light-squared bishop has on the long diagonal, and to open this up he needs to maintain the pressure against d4; to achieve this his dark-squared bishop must also remain on its long diagonal, and accordingly the square g7 must be vacated to provide against g5. Black is natu- rally not afraid of the 'hanging pawns' arising from dxc5; indeed he actually 1 16...Jkc8 may be even stronger. By covering e6, Black eliminates the Sxg6+ trick and can safely take on g5 next move. Defending against the attack on the castled king 291 wants to induce them. In the presence of the two bishops such pawns are not usu- ally considered a weakness in any case; here there is the additional matter of forcing open the light-squared diagonal. The move 12...£te6 is worth mentioning too; this also increases the pressure on the square d4, but it allows 13 g5 after which 13...cxd4 is insufficient on ac- count of 14 gxf6 dxc3 15 Bxh7+!. The classic bishop sacrifice, incorrect on the eleventh move and replaced by g4, has appeared in a correct form in an altered

Black gives up the pressure on the centre temporarily in order to drive White's bishop back to bl, thus making it more difficult for the rook on al to go into ac- tion; this is important, since without both the rooks it is hard to carry out an attack on Black's 'artificially-fianchettoed' king position. 17 &bl If 17 Bb5 Black would be able to play 17...Se4! aiming to eliminate the en- emy rook, which is very annoying for him at h4.

11 The phases of the attack on
the castled king The exposition up to this point may have appeared to some readers to have been a series of fragments, in which the various aspects of the attack on the castled king have been closely looked at but which still need to be combined into a whole. However, it was essential first to collect together as much knowledge as possible about the various elements of the attack on the castled king, then to get to know the main principles of defence against this attack, and only after that to begin to bring everything together in this chapter, which is devoted to the temporal aspect or phases of the attack on the castled king. The temporal aspect here is naturally a framework for the points we wish to make, which rest on the following basic the- ses, already fairly well elaborated in earlier chapters. 1 ) An attack on the castled king cannot be successfully carried out on the ba- sis of the attacker's wishes or 'brilliance'alone, but the essential conditions for it must also be present. 2 ) These preconditions may be fulfilled to a greater or lesser degree, and the attacker's game must adapt itself accordingly. 3) The degree and type of these preconditions accurately determines the extent of the commitments which the attacker can undertake without harm; thus there is a logical and reciprocal relationship between preconditions and commitments, and by this the actual phase which the attack has reached can be recognized. The proposition of these theses, which will be illustrated in later examples, leads us first of all to a brief discussion of preconditions and commitments. Types of preconditions Preconditions are naturally contained in the position itself, whether in the at- tacker's territory or his opponent's. The attacker, for instance, may have his pieces strongly deployed in the vicin- ity of the enemy king position or aimed in that direction, and it may also be that the general mobility of his pieces or his advantage in space assists him in attacking. At the same time, there must be some deficiencies in the defender's camp; the chief of these is the vulnerability of the king position, either through weaknesses in the pawn structure or because pieces are misplaced in relation to the castled
294 The Art of Attack in Chess
position, being overburdened by obligations to cover squares on other parts of the board. These and similar preconditions should generally be fulfilled at the first or ini- tial phase of the attack, but it may also be that they can be created by force at this stage, e.g. by the provocation of weaknesses. The second phase of an attack can follow a wide variety of courses. It may be a question of a quick attack leading to mate, usually by means of a sacrifice, and in this case it is naturally unimportant to talk of further preconditions. However, if the attack is slower or does not have an uncompromising character, the second phase is usually concerned with the creation of further conditions as guarantees of success. The following are among the most important operations at this stage: the provocation of further weaknesses; the exclusion of one's opponent's coun- terattack or its suppression; control of the centre; restraint against a central coun- ter-thrust by one's opponent, and so on. The third phase of an attack is of course characterized by the execution, either in the form of mate, of obtaining a decisive material advantage, or of being able to call off the actual attack on the king and obtain a positional advantage or fa- vourable ending. Types of commitment To the above-mentioned types of preconditions necessary for an attack there also correspond various types of commitment which the attacker can, and indeed must, enter on, if he is going to attack. The commitments which correspond to the first phase are, of course, minor ones, usually a question of tempi. A player, for instance, spends a tempo improv- ing his prospects for an eventual attack, transferring a piece from one side of the board to the other or the like; admittedly, the degree of commitment involved is not great, but it can become significant if the attack on the king is never carried out. It is natural that contemporary masters, in an era of precise opening play, aim first of all at sound moves, which give nothing away to their opponents and con- stantly strengthen their general positional build-up; the result of play according to this recipe on both sides is that a drawn position is reached. It should also be said that Alekhine1 knew how to instil a little aggressiveness into his moves even in the opening and create some conditions for attack with a minimum of commit- ments. This is precisely where his skill lay, and it is this which is lacking in many masters. 1 and Kasparov! The phases of the attack on the castled king 295 A somewhat greater degree of commitment is entailed in the second phase. It may be a question here of a sacrifice accompanied by considerable compensa- tion, of the dislocation of a number of pieces, or, in particular, of the advance of the wing pawns, which as a rule represents a fairly far-reaching positional com- mitment. Still, in this phase too the sensible player aims to conduct his game with a minimum of commitments, unless he is undertaking an uncompromising mat- ing attack that is certain to succeed. It is especially important that the attacker should avoid a pattern of thinking whereby an unclear attack is reckoned as part of his compensation. For instance, he may sacrifice a knight for two pawns and an 'attack'; when that 'attack' peters out, his reckoning naturally falls to the ground. Assessment of preconditions and commitments One of the attacker's most important tasks is assessing the extent to which the preconditions for an attack are present and the degree of commitment which may be incurred. The following positions provide examples of this task. This position is from the game Botvinnik-Chekhover, Moscow 1935. It is White's move, and he has to decide on how to pursue what is already a promising initiative. He has the upper hand in the centre, a strong knight on e5, and well- placed bishops; all these factors together mean that he has some of the precondi- tions for an attack on the king, without yet having entered on any commitments. He can therefore be said to be on the threshold of the first phase and must conse- quently look for further moves which will prepare an attack, while committing himself as little as possible. Thus, it would clearly be out of the question to make a pawn advance with h3 and g4, since Black would then find it easy to parry the
296 The Art of Attack in Chess
main threat, after which White would be left only with pawn weaknesses, to say nothing of the dangers which would arise on the diagonal a8-hl. A slightly lesser degree of commitment would be entailed by White's ma- noeuvring his al -rook to h3 via el and e3, but it can be shown that such a dis- placement of the rook would in fact be premature; Black could easily parry the threats involved and then himself prepare for the counter-thrust ...b5 (e.g. by ...£}f8 and ...Sac8) thereby opening up the c-file, over which the white rook on h3 no longer has any influence. Because of this Botvinnik decided on a third plan, which involved the least degree of commitment; this consisted of transfer- ring the c3-knight via dl and f2 to h3 and thence on to g5. Admittedly, there is a definite commitment here too - in the shape of the number of tempi used; how- ever, Black cannot really take advantage of this, and there is the additional point that the threat posed by the position of the knight on g5 is quite genuine and can- not be easily parried. Now here is the course that the game took:
1 Re2!
First White thoroughly eliminates the possibility of Black's playing ...b5.
1...£tf8 2 Ndl Sa7
2.. .#te8 would probably have been better.
3 Rb8 4 2>h3 h6
Now there is a weakness in the black king position as well. White still presses on. 5 £}g5! hxg5 6 fxg5 This is of course already the second phase, since White is committed materi- ally; at the same time, his attack breaks through. If now 6... 6h7 7 Nxf7 £}xg5 (or 7...Axg5 8 Nxh7+ Nxh7 9 Rxe6') 8 Rh5 Ngh7, then 9 d5 exd5 10 h6+ Nh8 11 Rf7 f6 12 Rg8+ and 13 Nf7#. 1 6... 8d7 7 Nxf7 2 In fact, it would have been simpler and quicker to play 7 Nxd7 5xd7 8 gxf6 Nxf6 9 Sxf6 gxf6 10 Rg4+ *f8 11 Na3+ Sd6 12 Rf4 <Ne7 13 c5.

2 Recent analysis has shown that this further sacrifice is quite wrong, in that
Black could later play S.-.'i'fS! with fair defensive chances. Therefore White should have chosen 7 xd7, as given by Vukovic. The phases of the attack on the castled king 297 This position arose in the game Alekhine-Gilg, Semmering 1926. It is White's move, and he decided on an attack, although the preconditions were only par- tially fulfilled. Black's king position is weakened and some of White's pieces are well placed, but there is as yet no communication between his rooks. Meanwhile, it is of decisive importance that Black is able to launch a counterattack based on his control of d4 and the exposed position of the white king; the general instabil- ity in the centre is also to Black's advantage. We shall see how Alekhine's attack came to grief in this position. Ig4? Seeing that the preconditions for an attack have not been fulfilled, this addi- tional commitment by White turns against him. The correct move, objectively speaking, was 1 jLe3, which would have led to approximate equality but not to an attack on the king. 2 2Bxf6+ Rxf6 3 f5 d4 4 g5 Nxf3+ 5 Rxf3 hxg5 6 h4 Se8! 7 £dl

It is clear that White's attack has been repulsed and that he must now defend himself against an action by Black. c3+ 15 Nc2 Rxe3+ 16 <Nbl Nxc2+ 17 Sxc2 axb4 18 Rxh4 bxa3+ 19 Na2 Rh6! Since the exchange of queens is now forced (if 20 Wei, then 20...W6 would be decisive) the danger on the h-file disappears and Black's superiority in the endgame is decisive. White lost the game in due course. The game is also, of course, a good example of indirect defence. This position is from the game Gligoric-Kostic, Zagreb 1947. White was afraid that, if he allowed ...cxd4 cxd4, he would not be able to maintain his back- ward pawn at d4, so he played 1 d5 exd5 2 .xd5, intending to support the cen- tralized bishop on d5, if necessary, by c4. However, this is not a good plan, since it leaves White with an inflexible posi- tion as well as the danger of an inferior endgame. On the other hand, the back- ward d-pawn is not a great drawback, as long as White strives to obtain compensation in an attack on the king. The preconditions are in fact there, for Black's position has been weakened by ...h6, and White can rapidly post his queen and bishop on the bl-h7 diagonal and so force a further weakness in the shape of ...g6. It should also be noted that Black has no minor pieces on the kingside, while his knight and bishop on the queen's wing are obviously not suit- ably placed for defence. In the centre Black can only exchange pawns on d4, while a pawn advance on the queen side is too slow. The preconditions for an at- tack on the castled king are therefore fulfilled to a considerable measure; White The phases of the attack on the castled king 299 can play for an attack - indeed he must, for otherwise he may well find himself in difficulty over the backward pawn.

The creation of preconditions The preconditions for a successful attack on the castled king can arise in a num- ber of different ways. Some arise out of the normal process of building up a posi- tion; some are created by the player's own moves, which are specifically aimed at such an attack; some occur unnoticed, as it were, in the course of the game; and others are the result of risky or even faulty play by the opponent. Let us leave aside those cases where the preconditions are created 'unnoticed' or through faulty play and turn our attention to those whose origin is conscious and calcu- lated. In this connection we are already acquainted with a rule which has few ex- ceptions. Of all the diff 'erent preconditions for an attack on the king, one should create first those which entail the lesser degree of commitment, i.e. those which are of use not only in the event of an attack on the king, but also go to strengthen one's position in general. Good posts for one's pieces, spatial advantage, strength in the centre, the secu- rity of one's own king - all these are factors of use in an attack on the castled king but which do not commit one to it. Commitment occurs gradually as weaknesses in the castled position are induced and as a flexible central formation is trans- formed into a fixed one (e.g. when, with pawns at e4 and d4, one plays e5). In other words, weaknesses in a castled position can be full of point if it comes to an attack, but otherwise they may be without significance or even useful to the side which has incurred them, e.g. ...h6 may provide a flight square for the king; or ...g6 may prepare the advance ...f5. Equally, a premature advance in the centre
300 The Art of Attack in Chess
can entail a general positional commitment and so profit the opponent in various ways. More gradual commitments also arise from a regrouping of minor pieces outside the castling area but with the sole aim of attacking the castled king. It is already more difficult when it comes to transferring a rook to the third rank, since this rook will need some time to return and reopen communication with the other one, should the attack not succeed. The engagement of minor pieces in the vicin- ity of the castling area (e.g. as a result of moving a knight to g5) also involves a heavier commitment in terms of tempi. However, the heaviest commitments are those incurred in an attack carried out with the aid of pawns. Of these the heavi- est is usually incurred by advancing the g-pawn, next comes the advance of the h-pawn, while advancing the f-pawn entails the least commitment. Now we have a small graduated scale for the degree of commitment incurred by the various op- erations which are necessary to create the preconditions for an attack on the cas- tled king; it need not be emphasized, perhaps, that this scale has only a general and approximate validity. Let us now examine the following example from prac- tical play. This position is from the opening stages of the game Alekhine-Weenink, Prague 1931. It is White to move. INd3! The textbooks gave .c4; Alekhine's move takes into account the fact that Black is about to castle kingside and threatens e4 and e5 followed by Bxh7 Iw- (whether Black castles or not). As a result, Black has no better move than ...h6, which means that a weakness in his castled position has already been brought about, and without any special expenditure in time by White, since Bd3 is a natu- ral developing move in this position. Inducing weaknesses like this is naturally correct in any circumstances. The phases of the attack on the castled king 301
1...h6 2 e4 Rd8 3 O-O 2>bd7 4 b4
With his second move White occupied the centre, with his third he made his king secure, and now he safeguards his central position against the counter-thrust ...c5. Apart from this, b4 prepares the ground for piece regrouping on the queenside.
4...O-O 5 Re2
This contains the threat of 6 e5 followed by 7 Re4 but, at the same time, does not yet commit White in the centre. It would be a mistake to play 5 e5 Nd5 6 Sb3 Se8 7 Re2 £}f8, since Black would then have managed to centralize his knight at d5 and invalidate the attack based on Re4. The move e5 must clearly be reserved for a later moment when ev- erything else is ready.
5...2e8 6 Zb3!
Primarily, this frees the square bl for the bishop so that the queen may be placed in front of it on the diagonal bl-h7. It also makes it possible to transfer the rook to g3 or h3 as part of the attack later on, but it does not otherwise commit White to an attack on the castled king, since the rook can also be used for play, for instance, on the c-file.
6...Rc7 7 &bl h7 (D)
Black is too weak to fight back in the centre by 7...e5. After 8 dxe5 £}xe5 9 £}xe5 Rxe5 10 jLb2 White obtains a strong attacking position. If 7...Nf8 (in or- der to meet 8 e5 with 8... d5) then 8 followed by Sg3, etc. 8e5 This central pawn thrust commits White more than any other move hitherto. Clearly, he is now no longer thinking of the endgame but is intent on forcing home an attack on the castled king. It is of decisive importance that Black does
302 The Art of Attack in Chess
not have ... d5 available; if he plays, for example, 8... b6, White's threats take effect even more quickly, e.g. 9 Re4 10 Rg4 <Nh8 11 Rh5, etc. So Black must resort to defence and not play for ...£k!5.

Nb6 11 Jlxe6+ h8, when White loses his bishop. 9 exf6 Nxf6 10 Re4 hf8 11 Rg4 Nh8 12 Rh5 Nh7 Otherwise 13 Jlxh6 wins. 13 lei Sad8 14 g4!, and now we have reached the position which was dealt with on page 212. White's heaviest positional commitment in the game, the move g4, occurs exactly at the moment when the attack on the castled king has come to a head. The reader should observe the time sequence of each operation in this game, particularly with reference to the degree of commitment. The mild commitment incurred by Sb3!, the greater one by e5, and the heaviest one by g4, correspond exactly to the phases of the attack and to the strength of the threats which White has at his disposal. After this example, in which we have seen the temporal relationship between the various operations designed to create the preconditions for an attack, let us turn to a separate examination of each of these operations. First, the inducement of weaknesses in the castled position. This is an impor- tant operation, although it usually forms part of another operation and tends to be limited to one or two moves. It can take the form either of the unprovoked or faulty weakening of the castled position or of the correct advance of a pawn or pawns in front of the king which, because of faulty play later on, results in an ap- preciable weakness (e.g. when a flight square for the king, originally advanta- geous, becomes a weakness); then there is the case of the weakness which is enforced early on without any loss of tempo, while on the other hand, there are weak points which arise in the sacrificial whirlpool of the attack's final phase. All these cases show our theme in its wider sense. In the narrower sense, the inducement of weaknesses implies an operation on which the attacker spends one or more tempi with the sole aim of weakening his opponent's castled posi- tion in a definite way. An operation of this kind which entails an expenditure of several tempi represents a very real commitment, and so it usually belongs to a stage when most of the conditions necessary for an attack have already been ful- filled. There have already been many examples of the inducement of weaknesses, so two will be sufficient here. The phases of the attack on the castled king 303 w This position is from the game Lilienthal-Bondarevsky, USSR Absolute Championship, Leningrad/Moscow 1941. Black had come to grief through play- ing an incorrect version of the Marshall Attack in the Ruy Lopez; a pawn up, White does not have a hard task ahead.

White wins after both 13...Rxg5 14 fig4 and 13...fxg5 14 Qxc6. 1-0 Black did not wait for the unanswerable 14 Jlxd5. The continuation from this diagram shows the correct enforcing of a weakness on g6 followed up by consistent play against the focal-point g7; an alternative line illustrates how provocation can be exaggerated with the result that it turns against the attacker. l dl The queen, on its way to d3, gains a tempo by attacking the knight. The alter- native iWbl h6 2Wdl b5 3 Rd3 g6 is inferior. Here, besides the essential weak- ness at g6, White has also extracted a 'secondary' one at h6, but in fact this is not a weakness at all, since it simplifies Black's defence of the focal-point g7. For ex- ample, after 4 Jkf6 Bd8 5 Rh3 Bxf6 6 exf6 <Nh7 7 Sfl Bh8! 8 2f3 g8 Black has defended himself against White's main threat of Rxh6+, and consequently the situation is no longer clear.

The next three examples are concerned with cases where the creation of the preconditions for the attack on the king demands the removal of the opponent's pieces from defensive positions or their displacement in some way. This position is taken from the game O'Kelly-Castaldi, Hilversum 1947. Here Black's king position has already been weakened, White's pieces are all well posted, and there is no danger of counterplay in the centre or, indeed, anywhere; the only real obstacle is Black's queen, which is defending the kingside well at the moment, e.g. if 1 Rh6, then 1...Rg7. So the action White takes has the aim of inveigling Black's queen to as far away as b8!

There is no defence against Ng5, e.g. 4...Rf4 5 Ng5 Nf6 6 .Nxf7+ Nh8 7 .xg6. Actions of this type might be called indirect attacks on the castled king. In the following diagram, some of the preconditions for an attack on Black's king position are already present. White's pieces are fairly well placed, and the blocked centre makes it difficult for Black to counterattack. A breakthrough by ...b5-b4 would require rather lengthy preparation, while the other possibility -
306 The Art of Attack in Chess
capturing White's a-pawn - would bring him too little in return for the tempi spent on it. On the other hand, there are Black's un weakened king position and White's weakness on the light squares. The latter makes itself felt if the position is opened up. But how is White to progress, if he is not to play f5, i.e. if he does not loosen up the situation on the light squares a little? Surely not by 1 Ng5, which clearly involves a doubtful sacrifice. Nor by 1 g4 £k6 2 Nh4, on which Black plays 2...f5; for while, logically, the blocked position should then be over- come by 3 exf6, in fact the reply 3...gxf6 opens up the prospect of counterplay for Black by ...e5. There is no doubt about it: the position is not yet ripe for an attack on the king; it needs to be strengthened still further, or more exactly, the black pieces need to be driven further away. This can be done by playing the dark-squared bishop, with gain of tempo, on to the diagonal a3-f8, where it will settle. 1 i.cl Se8 2 Jla3 Rd7 The defence is even more difficult after 2...Rc7.

The precondi- tions for an attack on Black's king position have been only partially fulfilled; White is hindered particularly by the possibility of a counterattack by Black in the centre or down the c-file. White's prospects would be better if he could suc- ceed in driving away the f6- knight by e5 and then play <?3e4. To manage this he must first repulse the black knight from c4, which means sacrificing a pawn. That was just the sort of thing Yates was in the mood for. 1 b3! Nxa3 Black falls in with White's plan and imperils his knight on a3. In taking on this commitment he enables White to acquire additional preconditions for an attack on the king. If Black had played l...£jb6, which would have been better, White would have had to build up more slowly with 2 .b2. 2 e5! Ne8? Relatively the best solution for Black would have been to sacrifice a piece for three pawns by 2... xc2! 3 exf6 Bxf6 4 3xc2 Rxc3, although even then the ad- vantage lies with White after 5 Bd3.

Now the preconditions for an attack on the king are suddenly fulfilled. One black knight has been driven back to e8 and the other deflected to a3; while White's pawn on e5, supported by two good knights, provides a wedge in the centre. All this has cost only one pawn.

Of the cases where the opponent himself creates a precondition for an attack on the castled king the most important is that which involves the release of ten- sion in the centre. The next diagram provides a good example. This position is from the game Euwe-Maroczy, Zandvoort 1936. It is Black's move.
1...C4?
This releases the tension in the centre and so creates the one precondition which White still lacked before he could embark on an attack against the enemy king. Maroczy, a great expert on defence, is playing here under the influence of the thinking of the old school, which paid insufficient attention to the problems of the centre. In the Orthodox Defence to the Queen's Gambit, resolving the central tension by ...c4 generally gives White a powerful attack on the king, for a coun- terattack based on a pawn majority on the wing is much slower than that which takes place in the centre.

The first is a sam- ple of old-time brilliance, showing the unfolding of an overwhelming attack The phases of the attack on the castled king 311 resulting from feeble opening play by the opponent. In the second Black makes a risky experiment, and one of his pawns, wandering lonely among the white pieces on the kingside, remains as a consolation and the germ of the subsequent attack. In the third game the underlying conception of the attack is quite differ- ent, its main feature being Capablanca's rational and cautious method of ensur- ing that every possible means of counterplay on the part of his opponent is first suppressed.

19..>a5 20 Sedl?
White failed to find an answer to Black's double threat (...*?3xd5 and ...< g4) and instead of discovering the flaw in his opponent's bold plan, he gets himself into a difficult position. The phases of the attack on the castled king 315 Ragozin pointed out the continuation 20 Rd3! g4 21 Ne4 f5 22 £}g5 f2+ 23 Bxf2 Nxf2 24 <£'xf2 (if 24 Rc4 then 24... c3 while if 24 b3, Black plays
24...Bd4 25 d6+ h8, and White has no more than a draw) 24...Rxc5+ 25 Ng3.
If Black were then to take the d-pawn, the material balance would be restored but at the cost of allowing White to assume the initiative. For example, after
25...Nxd5 (not 25...Rxd5 because of 26 Se8+) 26 Qb3 Black is suddenly in dif-
ficulties owing to the threat of Scdl which is decisive even against ...*Nh8; con- sequently, he is forced to play 26... b5 27 Scdl Rxb3 28 cxb3 Sxdl 29 Sxdl and go into an unfavourable ending with the white rook on the seventh rank.

18 Rxd4 *e6 19 h4?
Up to here White has built up a series of preconditions for an attack on the en- emy king without making any moves which commit him to it. Now, without any real need, he goes in for such a move. Black's position is not yet ready to be taken by storm, so h4 is still premature. According to the scheme which we have worked out, now would be the time to complete the preconditions for the attack without incurring any positional commitments. White's queen is not yet secure in its possession of the long dark diagonal in view of the possibility of ...Sad8 followed later by ...4Ba4, and accordingly, priority should have been given to re- straining such counterplay, e.g. by 19 b3 Sad8 20 Rc3. Then after 20...£ac8, in- tending ...c5, Black's plan would be frustrated by 21 Ra5. Moreover, h4 is unsuitable in that it makes it more difficult to carry out the the- matic move f4 (because of the hole left on g4). However, White's position is strong enough to stand even h4 though it entails the expenditure of greater effort than otherwise would have been necessary.

318 The Art of Attack in Chess
23 a3 Starting with 21 Kfel, this is already White's third consolidating move. Be- fore storming the castled position White first of all excludes every prospect of counterplay by Black; a3 is intended particularly to deprive Black's queen of the square b4. This type of preparation for an attack on the king characterizes many of Capablanca's games. Alekhine preferred a different way of restraining counterplay, namely indirectly by means of dynamic blows. Hence the impres- sion of Alekhine's excessive eagerness and Capablanca's exaggerated caution as the characteristics of their styles. In fact everything depends on the specific posi- tion; in some cases Alekhine's method is correct, in others Capablanca's.

Fluctuations in the phases of attack To conclude the chapter some observations should be added, with examples, to dissuade the reader from accepting the principles and maxims expounded as a rigid pattern. The game of chess is too complex and rich for it to be possible to re- veal its finer points fully on the basis of a few formulae. The practical player comes up against exceptions at every turn. Consequently, Lasker is right when he recommends in his book Common Sense in Chess that players should follow the principles of chess with a dash of humour... So if we have already seen how the preconditions for an attack on the castled king are created and how the attacker's commitments grow in proportion to the force and form of his attack, it still remains to point out some cases where things develop rather differently: cases where the attack appears to slacken off and, in- stead of a vigorous assault, suddenly requires quiet moves; where the player only toys with his attack and is in fact aiming at other goals; or where great masters grope in the dark and fail to see something right in front of their noses. Quiet moves that kindle the attack So-called quiet moves are often only apparently quiet, and may in fact spark off a fire just as violent ones do. Moves of this type usually occur in positions where the attack appears to be flagging but has in fact reached a point at which a belated addition has to be made to the preconditions in the form of a quiet move, if the at- tacker is to get any further. Here are a few examples of this kind of quiet move, il- lustrating the fluctuations that occur in the phases of attack. The following position is from the game Teichmann-Schlechter, Carlsbad
1911. It is White's move, and he begins with a sacrifice on f7.
1 Nxf7+ Nxf7 2 Ng5+ Ng8 3 Rh5 2>xf5 4 Rxh7+ Nf8 5 Rxf5+ <Ng8
After 5...<Ne7 6 Re6+ Nd8 7 Nf7+ Black would lose his queen. 6Wg6! After a series of checks we suddenly get this quiet move, which does not pro- vide any additional threat but merely blocks the g-pawn. This is precisely to the
320 The Art of Attack in Chess
point in this position, since if, for example, 6 Se3, Black plays 6...g6 7 Rxg6+ Rg7, when White is still a long way from his goal. The fact that it is both possible and good to devote a whole tempo to blocking the g-pawn is a result of Black's inability to organize an effective defence. He cannot move his queen or rook to e7 on account of Rh7+ and Rh8#, while 6...Ne7 is answered by 7 Rf7+ fol- lowed by 8 Se3. The game ended 6...Rd7 7 Se3 1-0, Black having no reply to 8 Sf3 and 9 Rh7#. to This position is from the game Steinitz-Lasker, London 1899. Black began with a double sacrifice.

Rxg5 Exfl+ 10 Exfl Exfl+ 11 <Nxf1 hxg5, and White loses the king and pawn ending. This position comes from an analysis of a critical variation in the game Mar- shall-Mieses, Cambridge Springs 1904. White has sacrificed a rook, and it is now his move. It would appear that the game must end in a rapid mating attack after 1 £fce4 !?. However, this 'powerful move' is in fact weak, since Black plays
1...Nc3!, after which 2 £}f6+ gxf6 3 exf6 does not work on account of 3...£te2+

1 Rh7+ <Nf8 2 Rh8+ Ne7 3 Rxg7 Sf8 4 Sxdl!
Just as soon as the attacking formation is completely developed, this precau- tionary waiting move follows with full force. Black is now powerless against the threat of Rf6+ followed by £je4-d6+. If 4... ?e8, then 5 <2)h7 Re7 6 <Nxf8 Rxf8
7 Sd8+; while if 4...Nd7, then 5 Rf6+ Ne8 6 Nce4.
The solution is simple when it is demonstrated, but for psychological reasons it is difficult to find; first, because we would rather believe in 'finessing and strengthening the position by indirect moves' than in a banal pursuit of the king; and secondly, because the move Sxdl needs to be inserted at exactly the right moment. Toying with an attack An attack on the king as an alternative which never materializes but which acts solely as a subsidiary threat in the context of play with other objectives is a phe- nomenon which is abundantly represented in the games of the masters. The player merely toys with the plan of an attack on the king while, in fact, he is pre- paring and carrying out some other operation - a procedure which has a point if the threat to attack brings the player some advantage in tempi or helps the de- ployment of his pieces for the other operation. The advantage may take the form of the opponent's withdrawing a piece to the defence, as a result of which its ef- fectiveness elsewhere is lost or diminished. Or it may be that the move by which the player has built up the threat of an attack at the same time gains a tempo for the other operation. These are the simple ingredients of an objective 'toying' with the attack on the castled king. The subjective or psychological exploitation of the threat to the castled position can also involve various other motives. The threat can, for example, produce a feeling of insecurity in the opponent, oblige him to spend too much time in thinking, or even induce him to make some precaution- ary move merely to relieve his anxiety by the easiest means available. This last case can often be seen in the games of weaker players, when they play ...h6 'for safety's sake', but in a subtler and less perceptible way it also happens that mas- ters weaken their king positions in order to parry imaginary threats. We need only recall Burn's move ...g6 (page 289) as a defence against an incorrect classic bishop sacrifice! Questions like this fall outside the range of an objective treat- ment of the theme; the various forms of camouflage, the use of imaginary threats, speculation on an opponent's shortcomings, all these are features of practical play which have resulted from the dictates of that 'cruel, heavy-handed tourna- ment machine' - the clock. We are interested here only in the objective (i.e. cor- rect) threat and the objective (i.e. properly justified) reaction to it.
324 The Art of Attack in Chess
White is the better placed; he owes his superiority to the advanced position of his e-pawn, which secures him an advantage in space and cramps Black. The ac- tive placing of his pieces, the blocked centre, and the weakened enemy king posi- tion are all preconditions for an attack on the castled king. However, White has yet another advantage, namely, his rooks are united and he is a tempo ahead as re- gards control of the c-file; this would incline him towards a positional treatment of the game rather than an attack. One asks oneself whether the best plan is to attack or play on the c-file? The answer is that one should threaten an attack and continue to promote the precon- ditions for it; then, if Black defends correctly, the prospects of successful play on the c-file will be enhanced. Two moves which threaten the enemy king position are worth considering, i.e.
1 JLbl, threatening Rc2, and 1 Re3, which threatens a sacrificial assault on h6. If
1 JLbl, Black plays l...Se8 and parries 2 Rc2 with 2...£tf8. It would appear that
the time is then ripe for play on the c-file, but after the continuation 3 Rc7 Rxc7
4 Sxc7 Sab 8 5 Sfc 1 it is clear that this particular bolt has been shot; Black plays
5...jLd8 followed by ...Bb6, and White has nothing left on the c-file. The other
method is better.
1 Re3! Se8
This is forced; Black cannot defend himself without ...Nf8, as the following variations show: Bg5, when Black has no defence against Rh6+ followed by Jth7+, Af5+ and Nxe6+) 5 Rh7+ <Nf8 6 Rh8+ <Nf7 7 Ng5#. 2) l...Rb6 2 Bxh6 gxh6 3 Rxh6 f5 4 exf6 <Nxf6 (for 4...Sxf6 see above) 5 Rg6+ followed by mate. The phases of the attack on the castled king 325 3) 1... b6 2 JLbl ! \ and now, besides Jlxh6, there is also a threat of Rd3, etc.
2 Bc3 Nf8
Black has to withdraw his knight to the defence, since there is once again a threat of Bxh6. If, for example, 2...Rb6 (2...b4 3 axb4 Bxb4 4 Hb3 allows White to gain an important tempo for his attack) then 3 Bxh6 gxh6 4 Rxh6 W8 5 £}g5 Bxg5 6 Rxg5+ Nh8 7 Jtbl.
3 Bfcl (D)
One might well consider strengthening the attack even further by 3 h4. How- ever, that is a commitment, and its consequences are not clear. With 3 Bfc 1 White goes for play on the c-file, for which the conditions now are fundamentally better than in the position with which we started. On the one hand, White has gained the time to double rooks, and on the other, he has driven Black's knight back to f8, where it is now one tempo further away from the critical square c4, on which it clearly belongs. White owes his advantage here to his 'toying' with an attack on the castled king. The rest of the game is a matter of positional technique, and it could run as follows: 3,..Bc8 (if Black allows Ec7, then the threat of a sacrifice on h6 is renewed!) 4 Bxc8 Bxc8 5 Wei Bb7 6 d2! (if a good ending is White's objective, the dark-squared bishops should be exchanged as soon as possible)
6...Rd7 7 Nb4 Bc8 (or 7...Nd8 8 Aa5, when 8...i.e7 fails against 9 Bc7) 8
Bxe7 Excl 9 Wxcl Rxe7 10 Rc3 Rd7 (if 10...Nd7 , then 11 Rc7 is decisive) 11 £ki2, and White has a considerable advantage by virtue of his better bishop and more active knight. Black cannot avoid exchanging queens, after which an ex- change of knights or of the white bishop for the black knight would eventually leave White with a very favourable ending.
1 In this line White can still play 2 Bxh6.
326 The Art of Attack in Chess
'Not seeing in front of one's nose' It is a good thing to co-ordinate one's moves in an 'integrated action', but one should always try to see what is 'in front of one's nose' ; that is, if one can mate at once, one should do so and not philosophize about pawns. This somehow hap- pened once to Dr Vidmar, who (as White) reached the following position against Yates at London, 1922. This position is one in which White can win easily, but in a misguided moment he hit on the idea of 'combining everything into an integral whole' , i.e. he wanted both to attack and, at the same time, to 'cash in' on Black's e-pawn. As a result of this faulty desire to achieve two ends a drawn position was reached, which Black, however, proceeded to spoil and eventually to lose. Let us look first at the course the game took. 1 d5?I i.a8 2 Rh3 h6 3 Sfg4 st?h7 4 2>xe4? Rf8 5 xf6+ In his book A Half-Century at the Chessboard the great Yugoslav master re- cords that he spent three-quarters of an hour thinking at this point and then de- cided on the sacrifice. After his incorrect capture of the e-pawn there was no other choice left.
5...Rxf6 6 Sg6 Rf8?
This is a mistake; Black now lost after 7 Rg4! Rf7 8 Rg5 Nh8 (otherwise Rxh6+ wins) 9 f6 Rxd5 10 5hxh6+ 1-0. Black could have drawn by playing the natural move 6...Rxb2, e.g. 7 Shxh6+ g8 8 Hh8+ and if 9 fixg7+, then 9...Rxg7 10 Sh7 Bxd5, when White has nothing better than perpetual check. In the book mentioned above Dr Vidmar emphasizes how in this game the at- tack on the black king and the pressure on his e-pawn 'combined together to form The phases of the attack on the castled king 327 a greater whole' . But it is precisely this false union of ideas which was the reason for White's failure to discover the correct path to victory as, after 4,,.Rf8, he lis- tened to Big Ben chime quarter after quarter while his knight remained sus- pended in mid-air at e4. It is true that in the diagrammed position there are two factors making up White's advantage: a powerful kingside attack and a favour- able knight versus bishop ending (once all the heavy pieces are exchanged). These two elements could only be combined if the attack led to the exchange of the queens and rooks, but the attack can break through without exchanges, and consequently it is beside the point how good the ending is. In fact, taking the pawn on e4 promotes neither White's attack nor his endgame prospects, but sim- ply gives Black an opportunity of counterattacking along the e-file. Victory for White is an altogether easy matter, as long as he concerns himself entirely with the attack and forgets the pawn on e4 :
1 Rh3 h6 2 Sfg4 Nh7
This is all forced. 3 4te2! (D) White simply transfers the knight to h5 and carefully avoids the poisonous pawn on e4 !

White also wins after both 3...Sh8 4 4bf4 Jld7 5 Sg6 Ng8 6 hS1 and 3...Rf8 (or 3...Bd5 4 £rf4) 4 £tf4 followed by Sg6 and 4bh5.

Otherwise White wins even more quickly by <Nxf6+.

This shows how play should have proceeded from the original position, but things would have gone much the same way if, instead of 4 £}xe4?, White had played 4 4be2!, a point of which the reader can easily convince himself. 1 d5?! was only the first step along the wrong path, but 4 Nxe4? was a mistake which could have cost half a point. So it turned out that Dr Vidmar failed to see something 'in front of his nose' in London in 1922, nor did he see it thirty years later when he was writing his book. In this there is without doubt a touch of humour, the humour which Lasker rec- ommended as an addition to every sizeable dose of chess principles. From attack to endgame A host of examples could be given to illustrate the transition from an attack on the king into the endgame. It may be a question of heading for a drawn position as a lesser evil to the failure which would result from continuing the attack; it may also be that one variation of the attacker's combination leads to an ending. However, cases such as these do not really belong here. We are only interested at this point in cases where the attacker deliberately calls off the attack because his success is better assured by a favourable endgame. The classic exponent of the liquidation of an attack and the transition into the endgame was Pillsbury, so we shall open a series of examples with one of his games. The phases of the attack on the castled king 329 This position is from Pillsbury-Maroczy, Paris 1900. Although the situation is still far removed from the endgame, White is thinking about it all the same. Ifia5 He prepares for the exchange of the dark-squared bishops by means of Bc5, after which there is both an eventual threat of a bishop sacrifice on h7 and the prospect of an ending with White having a good knight against a bad bishop. 2 <±>hl Ece8 Avoiding the possibility of 3 Bc5 Bxc5 4 Hxc5 Rb6? 5 Hxc8.
3 Bc5 Rc7 4 Nxe7 Hxe7 5 g4
The positional obligation entailed by such a move is balanced by the fact that in this position White has no need to fear the endgame. If his opponent's dark- squared bishop were still there, the move would be risky.
5...Nc6 6 Saal fxg4 7 Rh4 g6 8 Rxg4 Hg7 9 h4 2te7?!
Black defends himself against an attack which is not dangerous and neglects something much more important, namely, the central point d4, which is of deci- sive significance in many types of ending. Precisely the opposite course was cor- rect, that is, to increase his influence over d4 and at the same time, by 9...Rb6, to question White with regard to what his plans were for the dark-square network. In view of the threat of 10...Re3 White would have to play 10 Hael, after which

15...6h8 16 <Nh2 fif8 17 h5
Pillsbury intends to establish his knight on the outpost at g5 and so gives up the line of play leading to an ending which he has followed up to here. The end of the game, which is no longer germane to our theme, runs as fol- lows: 17...fig4 18 £}g5 Sxf4 19 f7+ Rxf7 20 Rxf4 Rxh5+ 21 g3 Re2 22 Nh4 Sc8 23 Sael Rxb2 24 <Nh3 5xc3+ 25 5g3 2c2 26 fill 1 Sc8 27 Rh6 1-0' If 27...Rxe5, then 28 Rxh7+ and 29 g2#. In this position from Bogoljubow-Przepiorka, Pistyan 1922 the liquidation leading to an ending comes as the direct consequence of White's combination.

If 6...h6, then 7 £te7+? Nh7 8 £}f5? would be incorrect on account of 8...W1+ and 9...Sg8+; however, White can play 7 Qxh6 f5 8 Rg6+ h8 (or 8...Rg7 9 <2Be7+ Nh8 10 Rxh5+ Rh7 11 £}g6+, when White wins easily) 9 Nf6 Sxf6 10 xf6+, and the ending is won for White.

4.. >c8 1 5 Sxd7 Rxd7 6 Sdl Qc7 7 i.g5!
White breaks off his attack and steers the game towards an ending in which there are two factors which ensure him a clear advantage: control of the d-file and play against Black's weak c-pawn.
7.. .1,xg5 8 Rxg5 h6
White now continued with the thematic 9 Rd2 allowing the reply 9...i.e4; the result was that after 10 Rd7 fic8 11 f3 i.c2 12 2d2 i.bl Black's bishop got in among the small fry on the queenside, and it needed further incorrect play by Rabinovich before he eventually lost. Instead of 9 Rd2, White should have played 9 Re3, which indirectly maintains his control of the d-file and also pre- pares for Sd3 and Qd2. The next example will serve as an excellent conclusion to our discussion of the transition to the endgame. White's attack has got to the point where it exerts
1 Vukovic incorrectly gave 4...Re8 as the move played.
332 The Art of Attack in Chess
strong pressure on the focal-point h7, and it seems that the end must come quickly. However, appearances are deceptive, for there is no mate and Black can escape into an ending in which he can continue to resist. Thus, after 1 Bh7+ *Nh8 2 Bg6+ < ?g8 3 jtxf7+ Rxf7 4 3xf7 xf7, White runs out of checks and is unable to prevent Black from posting his rook on d7, af- ter which it is not at all clear how White can win. Another possibility is 1 Nh7, and this leads to even greater material gains; Black is obliged to play 1... 3e4!, but after 2 Bxe4 dxe4 3 3f6+ Rxf6 4 Rxf6 e3 the black pawn forces White's queen to retire, e.g. 5 Wfl (or 5 Rg5+ <Nf8) 5...e2 6 el f8, and White can hardly count on victory. Here we have, as a start, two ways in which the position resolves itself into an ending; the further analysis of the position should soon convince the reader that at every move there is a variety of possible simplifying lines, most of which lead to different types of endings. The winning process for White is based on the gradual preparation of the pawn structure on the queenside in readiness for the transition into an ending. In this two factors are decisive: the first is that, besides his knight on f6, Black's queen is also immobilized since it cannot move from e7 because of the need to cover the squares f7 and f6; the second is that Black's pawns are also condemned to stay where they are. Any move on their part leads to Black's losing in the end- game after the manoeuvre .h7+, 4Lg6+ and ,xf7+. Accordingly, Black may only move his rook up and down, and even then he is denied the use of the square f8 because of Nh7. Now for the analysis: 1 c4! Sd8 Forced; White threatened 2 cxd5 cxd5 3 <Nh7+ hS 4 Ae4+ g8 5 Bxd5 Sf8
6 Rg6+ * h8 7 Bxf7. If l...dxc4, then 2 "Nh7+ followed by 3 Bd3+ and 4 Bxc4
wins in the same way. The phases of the attack on the castled king 333 2 c5! A step further towards a favourable ending. If 2 cxd5, then Black's best reply is 2...Exd5!. Also possible here is 2 Jth7+ h8 3 -fi.g6+ Ng8 4 .xf7+ Rxf7 5 Rh8+ ?xh8 6 Nxf7+ gS 7 Nxd8, but after 7...dxc4 8 bxc4 b5, Black's pros- pects of a draw are more than good. Now 2...Ee8 does not work because of 3 Nh7 <5be4 4 cl !, when Black is left without the possibility of ...Rd6 (which would have been an effective answer prior to c5) and at the same time there is a threat of 5 .xe4, etc., now that the white king can hold the enemy e-pawn. If 4...f6, then 5 uLxc4 dxe4 6 Rg6+ Nh8
7 Nxf6 and White wins.
3 <Na3 Eb8 It is easy to see that after 3...a5 White will win an ending with queen versus rook and knight because the pawn on plifies into an ending, and this time Black loses the pawns on a6 and c6, e.g. 4 Nh7+ Nh8 5 xf7+ Rxf7 6 Ng6+ Ng8 7 Nxf7+ <Nxf7 8 Rf4 Ec8 9 >b4 Ne7

The reader may care to investigate this rather studied example further, all the secrets of which lie in the moves made by the pawns on the queenside; the final outcome of the ending rests with them, for without them White is unable to win.
12 The attack on the king as an
integral part of the game We have examined the various aspects of the attack on the castled king and have covered each topic on the basis of present-day knowledge of the art of chess. This material has been presented with all the difficulties and deficiencies of a pioneer, but with the joy of a discoverer who has seen in new knowledge a confirmation of his faith in the values of chess and his own general theory of the game. The atten- tive reader who has battled his way with the writer from chapter to chapter will have observed the steady widening of the problem of the attack on the king; we began with the basic techniques of combination and have progressed to the kind of understanding which characterizes mastery of the game. The logical path we have taken has justified its call for a high degree of effort in return for new knowl- edge; its purpose is to show us the significance of the attack on the castled king in the full context of a game of chess. From our examination of the defence against a kingside attack and of the phases of such an attack, it has become clear that a correct attack is conditioned by the situation on all parts of the board and also by all that has happened in the earlier course of the game. An attack on the king is not some strange, exceptional, and daring operation like a grand slam in bridge. It is an action which is both logical and necessary; an action on which a player decides at a certain stage of the game; sometimes, indeed, he must decide on it, if his opponent is not to obtain an advantage or if the position is not to fizzle out into a draw. Lasker observed long ago that every action is essentially a diversion, a transi- tion from equality to some spatial or temporal commitment. An attack on the king demands a very large diversion both in terms of the number of pieces in- volved and of the degree of commitment arising out of any pawn moves it entails. A considerable diversion of this kind also logically needs a considerable number of preconditions, as well as a knowledge of how these conditions are interrelated. It follows, therefore, that the attack on the castled king is an extremely difficult operation, which is based on a perfect mastery of all the forms of chess tech- nique. Even in the early stages of the opening the first seeds of the preconditions for an attack on the king are already being sown, and the tense struggle for the central squares is tightly bound up with the successful outcome of the attack or defence. The characteristic features of a position, the weaknesses on both sides, The attack on the king as an integral part of the game 335 and the elements that affect the endgame - all these accumulate and become in- tertwined in such a way that at a certain moment they impel the player to decide on the final objective of his play. This is the moment of crisis in the drama of the games of great masters, when it has to be decided whether it is best to continue promoting the preconditions for an attack on the king or to seek a favourable end- ing. The decision is not easy, for both courses demand not only technique but the ability to weld all the elements involved into a whole; moreover, we are still in the dark about many of the laws governing this process. Chess skill at the present time comprises a mastery of combinative techniques and the possession of ma- ture positional judgement, while the science of the game has cleared up the prob- lem of the centre in the majority of openings. However, we are still a long, long way from a thorough knowledge of the laws governing the methods of integrat- ing all the elements into a strategic whole. And where there is insufficient knowl- edge one proceeds 'by feel', or in other words, one takes risks. The endgame and the attack on the king are two areas about which our knowledge is incomplete, but they are also two directions in which chess can be further explored and through which the ancient game can be raised to a still higher level. We have said that there still exist areas in the art of chess where our knowledge is incomplete, and many of our readers may ask whether there are not at least some signposts pointing to where new knowledge might be found. The very at- tentive reader may also recall that mention was made in the Introduction of Alekhine's and Capablanca's understanding of the attack on the king and that a discussion on this subject was promised at the end of the book. Indeed, this is the right place for such a discussion, since the most difficult and arcane matters should be dealt with at the end, after everything else has been elucidated. The discoveries of Alekhine and Capablanca It is a slightly strange thesis that one should go back to the period before the Sec- ond World War and look for the culmination of the art of the attack on the king in the play of Alekhine and Capablanca. For have not Botvinnik and Smyslov, Keres and Bronstein, Reshevsky and Gligoric in their rich creativity in the field of chess discovered all that Alekhine and Capablanca knew and also gone on to add something else? It is indeed true that they have proceeded further in many re- spects, and perhaps even in their knowledge about the attack on the king they are the equals of the great masters of the past; in their actual games, however, they have not so far put it into practice to the full. If we delve into the whole of chess literature looking for games which serve to illuminate the logical integration of the attack on the castled king and the game in its entirety, then those of Alekhine
336 The Art of Attack in Chess
and Capablanca remain the unsurpassed models; side by side with them may be placed a few of the games of Rubinstein, Keres, and Bronstein, though we shall find scarcely any new discoveries in them; the whole period from Alekhine's death to the present day has not been particularly fruitful in the sphere of the at- tack on the king. So one is justified in going back to Alekhine and Capablanca as the first to discover knowledge which to this day has been neither refuted nor su- perseded. As far as these actual discoveries by Alekhine and Capablanca are concerned, it can be said that they did not take the form of some new principle but rather de- pended on a new way of thinking, which proceeded subjectively and therefore in a manner which cannot be expressed or comprehended on a theoretical basis; by these methods they discovered moves which fulfil the chief principle of the at- tack on the castled king, namely, obtaining the maximum preconditions for an at- tack with the minimum of commitment. This principle in itself is a simple one and can be easily remembered, but play- ing in accordance with it is extremely difficult. Here two grades of values must be clearly distinguished: the one based on the value of the individual precondi- tions and the other on that of the successive commitments undertaken. This must then be resolved into a precisely ordered series of moves, while one must also be ready at any moment to convert the attack into some other thematic course of ac- tion - all of which requires considerable mastery. From a close study of the games of Alekhine and Capablanca one can con- clude that they did indeed use a perfected method of thinking in the sense men- tioned above; only, in the case of Alekhine this thinking was more analytical and logical, while with Capablanca it was more artistically intuitive. However, the re- sults of this thinking, that is, the actual moves, do not appear to differ greatly to the outside observer. However, Alekhine's discoveries can be somewhat more precisely defined than Capablanca's; Alekhine's output was more abundant, he 'lived chess' more deeply, and he was a more passionate analyser of his own games. A particular characteristic of his commentaries is the frequent use of the idea of commitment (just as with Lasker we get the idea of compensation, with Steinitz that of the balance of the position, and with Nimzowitsch that of central- ization). One could say that of all masters Alekhine had the most refined sense of the degree of commitment, even though his temperament sometimes led him to be too eager. When Alekhine, with apparent nonchalance, played, for instance, h4 against the French Defence, this appeared to his contemporaries to be 'the pretentiousness of genius', but a closer analysis today reveals that behind such moves there lay a great deal of mental calculation and hard logic, and that this move h4 belongs The attack on the king as an integral part of the game 337 exactly when it was played; a move earlier it would have been weak and on the next it would be too late! Further illustration of all these points will be better obtained by the reader from the actual games which follow. Alekhine - Asztalos Kecskemet, 1927 Queen's Gambit Declined

A little experiment in the opening - and a dangerous one when Alekhine is on the other side of the board. The spatial advantage now obtained by White is worth more than Black's two bishops. 5 -kxf6 Rxf6 6 Nc3 c6 7 Rb3 <Nd7 Having started experimenting, Black ought to have gone on in like manner, e.g. 7...Rf5 8 e3 £ki7 9 Sdl g6, by which he would have put more difficulties in the way of White's plan to gain space in the centre.

338 The Art of Attack in Chess
15.. .a5 16 a3 a4
Now 17 4bh5 can be met by 17... a5. However, as a result of Black's advance of the a-pawn, his pawn structure on the queenside has lost its flexibility, which in its turn makes it easier for White to favourably resolve the tension in the centre.
17 Ra5 18 Wcl Nd7 19 c5!
This threatens £fc4-b6 and thus induces Black to play ...b5, which leads to a blocked position on the queenside and restricts his counterplay in the event of White's launching an attack on the kingside.
19...b5 20 Ne4 (D)
A series of preconditions for an attack on the king has been created: the weak- ness represented by the black pawn at h6; the aggressive placing of White's pieces; his control of the centre; and Black's limited resources on the queenside. White, however, is not in a hurry to attack, for he sees that he can use his pressure on c6 to improve the deployment of his own pieces and, at the same time, to con- strict his opponent's.
20...Rc7 21 Rc3 Ne8 22 e2!
White is thinking of the square b4.

Against the threatening line-up of white knight at b4 and queen at f3 Black has only two expedients, namely, the direct weakening of his king position by ...f6 or an indirect weakening in the form of the exchange of his knight, which defends the square h7. Black decided on the latter course. 24 jxd7 Sxd7 25 d3 Sd8 26 e5 i.f8 Black is sure that the enduring pressure on the diagonal against h7 will oblige him to play ...g6. Logically, therefore, he decides upon a delayed fianchetto as the best means of putting up some resistance. The attack on the king as an integral part of the game 339 27 h4!

1-0 Having played so excellently and - as regards the method of preparing the at- tack on the king - so instructively, Alekhine concludes the game with a sacrifice that is not fully correct! I say 'concludes', because Asztalos took fright and re- signed when he could well have played on. The continuation which Alekhine had in mind and which he expounded in the tournament book contained a loophole giving a draw, and even against White's best play Black would have had drawing chances. Let us first look at Alekhine's line.
340 The Art of Attack in Chess
42...Rxf7 43 .d3+ Rg6 44 Nxg6+
If 44 Rg3, Black replies 44,..Sg7, while 44 Rf3 can be met by 44...Sd5. Thirdly, 44 Rg5 xd3 45 Rg8+ Nh6 46 Rh8+ Rh7 47 Rf8+ Rg7! 48 Sxg7 Sxg7 49 Rf6+ Bg6 50 Rxd8 Be4+ probably results in a draw.
44.. .Bxg6 45 Sxg6?
So far this is Alekhine's analysis. However, 45 Rf6! Sg8 46 Rxe6 is stronger and does indeed win, though White still has a hard task ahead1.
45...6xg6 46 Re4+ <Ng7 47 e5+
Here Alekhine concludes his analysis with the remark that Black 'after a few further checks, would inevitably lose one of his rooks.' In fact, he loses after all moves except 47... g6 followed by keeping the king on g6 or g7. After 48 Rxe6+ < >g7 49 Rxc6 Sbl+! 50 Ng2 Sxd4 51 07+ Ng6 the checks cease, whereupon Black's rooks begin to deploy themselves for play against the king or the c-pawn. One cannot see how White can win; the position is very likely drawn. Alekhine unintentionally bluffed the unfortunate Asztalos and the jury, who on the basis of his analysis awarded him the Brilliancy Prize. We must now point out what is objectively the strongest move and the continu- ation by which White wins. Thus (instead of 42 £}xf7!?) he should have pro- ceeded as follows:
42 Rg3 Wf 8 (D )
Forced; if 42...f5, then 43 Rg8+ followed by Rh8+ and Rf6+ is decisive, while if 42...Rf6, then 43 .d3+ wins.

(D) Can it be that White is justified in switching to an attack on the king after prep- arations which were clearly directed at the c-file? How does this fit in with our thesis on the need to fulfil a series of preconditions before opening an attack on the king? In fact, there is no contradiction; the preconditions are present, but they have arisen in a different way from those in the Alekhine-Asztalos game. It is true that the preconditions for the attack on the castled king in this game have come about suddenly and somewhat incidentally; at the same time, this has occurred quite legitimately. The main point is that White's play, starting with 12 a4, serves two purposes: it maintains the pressure on the c-file and simulta- neously improves the preconditions for an attack on the king. As a result of 12 a4 b4 and 18 b3 the position on the queenside became blocked, and this has reduced Black's prospects of counterplay, while 17 dxc5 resolved the tension in the cen- tre. Furthermore, 13 Bxf6, 15 Bxe4, and 16 Rxe4 represent, in effect, a far- reaching elimination of Black's defending pieces; in the same way, the struggle revolving around the pawns on the c-file has forced Black (in 17...Ra5 and
18... .xc5) to displace two pieces which are important for the defence of his king
position. This is without doubt a full set of preconditions, built up with true The attack on the king as an integral part of the game 343 Capablanca virtuosity and elan. Now White's knight, a sort of 'equus ex ma- china', stirs up a whirlwind attack on the king, against which there is hardly an adequate defence.
19...h6?
Although Black has no really sound reply at his disposal, 19...f5 was the lesser evil. Then White does not gain much by 20 Re5 Bb6 while if 20 Rb7, Black plays 2O...Rb6, and after 21 Rf7+ <Nh8 22 Rh5 h6 White's attack stops, for ex- ample, 23 h4? Nxe3! 24 Rg6 is not sound, since after 24...hxg5 25 hxg5+ Ng8 White cannot give perpetual check, while 26 Bh7 is weak on account of
26...Rd4. The best line is 20 Rc4 Sac8 ! 21 Nxe6 Nb6 22 Rxc8 Sxc8 23 Sxc8+
Nf7 24 £}g5+ Ng6 25 £tf3 Qd5 26 O-O .d8 followed by ...Bf6 with some chances of a draw . This continuation would have been relatively the best way out for Black. Better than the text move but worse perhaps than 19...f5 is 19...g6. An analysis of this move, which, though it may emanate from Capablanca, needs to be cor- rected, runs as follows: 19...g6 20 WS Sf8 (everything else is weaker; 20...Sa7 in particular, does not work on account of 21 Rc6) 21 Rh3 h5 22 Nxe6? fxe6 23 Rxe6+ Nh7 24 Rd7+ Nh8 25 Rc6; now the analysis continues with 25...Sac8?, ** missing the fact that Black can win by 25 Jtxe3! 26 fxe3 Rf52 27 Rf3 (forced)
27... dS 28 Re2 xb3, obtaining an attack and, before long, a material advan-
tage as well. This analysis can be improved by playing, instead of 21 Rh3, 21 W6 (threatening either 22 fic4 and 23 £}xh7 or at once 22 Nxh7) 21...Sae8 (if
21...h6 then 22 Nxe6 wins, while 21...Sac8 is not good because of 22 Sc4 ) 22
Re5 .b6 23 Rxa5 .xa5 24 Ne2 Sc8 25 Ne4, when White has much the better ending, for example if 25...Bfd8, then 26 £k:5 Sc6 27 #)b7 Sxcl 28 Excl Ed5 29 e4.
20 Rh7+ #f8 21 Rh8+ Ne7 22 Rxg7 hxg5 23 xg5+ Nd6 24 Ne2 (D)
Two pawns, the exposed position of the black king, Black's commitments at c5, and White's rooks on the c- and d-files - all this is obviously more than suffi- cient compensation for the sacrificed knight. Capablanca also particularly
1 After 27 Ec6+ Nf6 28 d4 I see no real chances for a draw; White has two
2 3 rooks and a pawn for the queen, and Black's king is exposed. One line is
28...'4'h5 29 Ec4 Jkxd4 30 Edl, followed by Edxd4.
O
This allows a defence by 27 Rc2, but Black can improve by 26...Rg5!, which does indeed win for Black. After 21...Eac8 22 Ec4 Black can defend by 22...Ec7!, for example 23 £sxh7 .e7 or 23 Eh4 Jke7. Thus it is hard to demonstrate an advantage for White after
19...g6.
The Art of Attack in Chess stresses Black's inability to stop the advance of the h-pawn while White is tying him down on the queenside.
24...Eac8 25 Ec4 Sc 6 26 Shcl Nb6 27 h4 f5
Capablanca had reckoned on the following transition into a won ending:
27...Ec7 28 h5 Eec8 29 h6 Nd6 30 Rxa5+ <Nxa5 31 Sxc7 Sxc7 32 Sxc7 Nxc7
33 f4 Jkd8 34 g4 Nf6 35 g5 Nh8 36 e4 <Nb6 37 f5 followed by g6-g7.
28 Rg7 Se7 29 Re5 Ec6
This loses at once, but 29...Eec7 has no future either in view of 30 h5.
30 Exc5 1-0
For, if 3O...Sxc5 then 31 Rd6+ is decisive. Capablanca's virtuosity in integrating all the features of the position into a co- herent whole is worthy of close attention. Alekhine - Kmoch San Remo, 1930 Nimzo- Indian Defence I d4 f6 2 c4 e6 3 Nc3 Nb4 4 Nd2 One of the most harmless continuations.

White has proceeded cautiously and prepared the ground for Rd3, with the aim of provoking a weakening of the enemy king position in the shape of ...g6. For this reason Kmoch prefers to go in for ...h6, which weakens him less. White can only obtain results by attacking the king, for Black is the better placed for the endgame. 21£tf3 If 21 e4 Black can reply 21...Rh4.

White has managed to weaken the enemy king position, but he still lacks the preconditions for a real attack. A little regrouping is therefore needed, and above all the square d4 must be safeguarded. If 24 Ef3 then 24.. Bc6 25 £}xc6 bxc6 is quite good for Black. Of the minor pieces the knights are more valuable than the bishops, from the point of view of both the attacker and his opponent.
24...5ac8 25 h3 d6?
Up to this point the author of The Art of Defence has defended correctly and preserved equality. Now, however, he goes astray in playing to exchange off his important knight, which is the main defender of his king position. Correct was

Apparently, Black has manoeuvred himself into a new defensive position, one which also affords the possibility of his inconveniencing White's queen further by ...a5. The only weak side of his manoeuvre is that it does not give sufficient at- tention to centralization. As a result, the alleged pawn weakling on d4 is trans- formed - ironically - into an aggressor, punishing Black for his neglect of the central squares.

The formation with pawns on c3, d4, and e3, bishop on d3, and knights on d2 and f3 characterizes the Colle System. White's plan is to force through e3-e4 and then exchange his d2-knight for Black's f6-knight on this same square; he thereby creates some of the preconditions for an attack on the king without The attack on the king as an integral part of the game 347 entailing any commitments. The Colle System, however, lacks positional depth and, consequently, Black does not have any great anxiety as regards the centre. Capablanca's treatment of the opening, adopting a Queen's Indian set-up, is both sound and also suitable for avoiding lines which equalize out to a draw. White's strong point in the centre is now eliminated, for he must recapture the pawn with his knight, otherwise 9 cxd4 Nb4 10 JLbl -*.a6 leaves Black with the better game.

First 10 £ xc6 would have been sounder. Preparation for an attack on the king, but also a weakening of the gl-a7 diago- nal.

Obviously not 13..Jlxfl? on account of 14 fxe5. Moving the bishop to a6 had other points: on the one hand, to drive the white queen back and, on the other, to induce White to play Sf3, whereby he undertakes a commitment to attack before the preconditions for a successful attack have matured. Against 14 e5 Black has 14...£kl5 after which 15 Bxh7+ does not work (be- cause of 15... xh7 16 Rh5+ g8 17 Sf3 f5 18 fih3 3xf4) while, given a free move, Black can consolidate his defences by playing 15...f5. In the event of other, slower methods of attack Black has a sound defensive plan based on the effective use of the diagonals for his bishops and a centralized knight on d5. This will be seen in the further course of the game.
14...g6!
In view of the restricted range of activity of White's dark-squared bishop, this weakness is negligible. It is important for Black to exclude short-term dangers on the kingside, since he needs time to increase his pressure on the central squares.

19 e5 £3d5 (D)
20Wf2?! Up to this point Colle's play has been a little pretentious but not really incor- rect, for his commitments have not been decisive ones. Still, he should now have admitted that it was pointless to continue playing for an attack and striven, by paying careful attention to the central squares, to keep the game within the well- known 'margin of a draw'; for example, 20 jLe3 jtxd4 21 cxd4 Sac8 22 Bb3!
348 The Art of Attack in Chess
when Black, after 22...Nxe3 23 Sxe3 clearly has nothing either in the centre or on the c-file; nor does 22...b5 or the like offer anything very much. (In Golom- bek's book Capablanca's Hundred Best Games of Chess, instead of 22 .b3 1, the erroneous 22 2c 1? is given; then Black does indeed get the upper hand by
22...Nxe3 23 2xe3 Rc4.)
2O...jkxd4?I Satisfied with the centralization he has achieved, Black too now becomes rather presumptuous and opens up the c-file prematurely. 20...f5 followed by a quiet positional plan based on ...b5-b4 was probably best. In that event simplifi- cation by 21 Nxc6 Bxf2+ 22 Nxf2 Jlxc6 would give Black the better ending, while if 21 Be3, then 21...Jtxd4 22 cxd4 £3b4 would be perfectly agreeable. The move suggested, 20...f5, signifies that Black is satisfied with a small ad- vantage, whereas Capablanca's idea aspires to dynamic play on the c- and f-files. However, the preconditions for this are insufficient, for counterattacks too de- mand preconditions and entail commitments just as attacks on the king do. The laws which determine the connection between the two types of action dictate the form, timing, and tempo of the counterattack in accordance with the state of the attack. Thus, the degree to which the attacking units have been diverted condi- tions the extent and force of the counterattack. In this case, therefore, direct de- fence by 20...f5 would have been better than 2O...Bxd4. 21 cxd4 5ac8 The immediate 21...f6 did not work on account of 22 Rh4 2f7 23 jkxg6. 22 i.dl! Other moves by the bishop are defeated by 22...Wxcl+. 22 Rh4 is also inade- quate; for example, 22...£}f6! 23 2g3 xc2 24 Be3 (to prevent ...Wdl+) 24... e4
25 Sh3 h5 and Black wins.
22...f6! (D)
The attack on the king as an integral part of the game 349 This much-praised move of Capablanca's is very economical in that it both at- tacks and defends in equal measure; it is probably Black's best, now that he has embarked on 2O... .xd4. It is also true that an attack generally collapses when the pawns in front of the king begin to 'bite' , but in this case the question is no longer one of attack but of the overall state of the position. Black has in fact awoken pos- sibilities for White on the c-file, and in the event of the game being opened up White's two bishops could come into their own.
23 Rh4?
This gains a tempo for Bf3 but neglects the development of his cl -bishop and al -rook. The correct move was 23 Jld2!. Capablanca's intention in that case was
23... 3xf4!? 24 Jlxf4 fxe5 25 Bf3 e4 but the combination has a flaw: White does
not play 26 .e2? (when 26. ..e3! wins) but 26 Rh4!, and Black finds himself in difficulties. Moreover, 23 Jtd2! cannot be met by 23...fxe5, e.g. 24 Scl Rb5 (24,..Wxcl would not succeed against correct play by White) 25 Sxc8 .xc8 26 Rh4, whereupon 26...Sf7 27 Rd8+ leads to a draw, 26...h5 is not good due to 27 Rg5, while the complications following 26...Nf6 27 fxe5 ,Na6 28 Sf3 seem full of uncertainty. Against 23 Bd2! Black would probably have to play 23...d6 24 Scl 3 Rd7, when 25 Sxc8 ,Nxc8 26 Sf3 results in a complex struggle in which White's dark- squared bishop derives pleasure from every exchange on e5. This repre- sents an analytical proof of the assertions made in the note to the twentieth move.
23...fif7 24 Nf3 Rc4
Since 25 Rf2 does not work (because of 25...Wxcl+) White is now lost.
