They felt that he had not touched upon much that was important and essential for a player who was aspiring to reach the top in chess. Thus there originated the idea of this book Play like a Grandmaster which the author has been working on for some years. It is a continuation volume to Think like a Grandmaster, and deals with the most important aspect of chess wisdom, those laws and rules which have been developed by theoreticians of this ancient game of skill which includes elements of science, art and competitive sport. The book also contains the author's personal observations and the results of his study of the achievements of his fellow grandmasters. In order to make the book a real textbook for players who have already mastered the elements and have some experience of play under com- petitive conditions, it contains several unusual but very important and recurring sections. The sections headed 'Learn from the World Champions'" show how various problems are solved by the kings of chess. Then we penetrate the depths of a grandmaster's thought processes in the sections 'The Mind of a Grandmaster', in order to understand how he thinks and solves problems at the board, how his mind works. Finally, 'How to Train' and 'Exercises' contain a description of methods of private study and training adopted by leading players in their time, as well as collections of relevant examples on various topics which will provide the reader with test material to work on by himself. Will the reader of this book play like a grandmaster after he has worked through it carefully? It is hard to say; naturally this will depend partly on his natural gifts and his persistence in trying to achieve his objectives, as Index 219

well as upon his personal qualities as a competitor. In any event the reader will certainly take a big step forward in his assimilation of chess theory, and will come to understand many fine points involved in thinking about his moves and in chess problem-solving. These are the factors which in the final analysis bring success in competitive play.

The Three Fishes of Chess Mastery In order to become a grandmaster class player whose understanding of chess is superior to the thousands of ordinary players, you have to develop within yourself a large number of qualities, the qualities of an artistic creator, a calculating practitioner, a cold calm competitor. We shall try to tell you about what a player needs in order to improve and perfect himself, and give advice on how to carry out regular training so that both your playing strength and style get better. Of all the qualities of chess mastery three stand out, just as in the old myth the world stands on three fishes. The three fishes of chess mastery are positional judgement, an eye for combinations and the ability to analyse variations. Only when he has a perfect grasp of these three things can a player understand the position on the board in front of him, examine hidden combinative possibilities and work out all the necessary variations; We consider it essential to start with the question of positional play. This is the basis of everything else. It is possible that because of your character you do not often play pretty combinative blows. There arc players of even the highest standard in whose games the sparkle of combinative play is quite rare. On the other hand in every game you play, in every position you study, you have no choice but to analyse and assess the current situation and form the appropriate plans. In order to provide the reader with a framework within which the fundamentals of positional play may be studied, we will first consider an important question which hitherto has not received the attention it deserves; namely, what are the basic types of struggle which arise in practical play?
10 Positional Judgement
A General Theory of the Middlegame If a chess statistician were to try and satisfy his curiosity over which stage of the game prosed decisive in the majority of cases, he would certainly come to the conclusion that it is the middlegame that provides the mose decisive stage. This is quite understandable, since the opening is the stage when your forces are mobilized, and the endgame is the time when advantages achieved earlier are realized, while the middlegame is the time when we have the basic clash of the forces, when the basic question, who is to win, is settled. That is why it would seem that chess theoreticians should devote the maximum attention to the general laws of the middlegame. Alas, this is far from being the case. There are very many books devoted to the huge mass of possible opening variations, and a fair number of books on the endgame, but far less attention is paid to the systematic study of the basic part of the game. Why is this? One reason is that experienced grandmasters do not have the time to devote to the difficult task ofdescribing typical middlegame methods and considerations, and this work tends to fall to people who have not played in top class events and who therefore lack the requisite deep study of this question. Apart from collections of combinative examples there are few books extant on the middlegame which can be wholeheartedly recommended. What we now undertake is an attempt to fill this gap in chess literature, to describe the rules and considerations which a grandmaster bears in mind during a tournament game. First of all we have to distinguish the different sorts of struggles which can arise. Let us consider two contrasting examples from grandmaster play. A General Theory oj the Middlegame 11

What happened in this game? We did not see any deep strategic plans or long range manoeuvring. From the very start the opposing forces flung themselves into a close order conflict and rained threats on the opponent's bastions. The whole game consists of sharp variations in which sacrifice A General Theory oj the Middlegame 13 followed sacrifice, and each tactical stroke met with a counter blow from the other side. Quite a different type of game now follows.

corresponding to this twofold division we get a marked difference in the working of the grandmaster's mind in each case. In the first case the player is always tensed up as he constantly examines complicated variations, takes account of tactical blows and tries to foresee and forestall deeply hidden, unexpected moves and traps. Little attention is given to general considerations since the player can hardly spare time for these in view of the time limit, and it is hardly necessary to bear them in mind in such positions. Sometimes he might just make some such general comment to himself as 'it would be nice to get a battery against 12 by 'c5 and Ab6', or 'watch out all the time for that open h-file', or 'try and get rid of that powerful bishop of his at e4'. However these are just short verbal orders to oneself, a formulation of the general ideas resulting from analysis. Obviously there are no such things as deep general plans, regroupings, manoeuvres. Concrete analysis, working out tactical strokes, spotting traps, anticipating cunning or surprising 'explosions'-that is what is called for in positions of the first type. So in the first case the mind is kept on tenterhooks, and works in accordance with the slogan 'keep a close watch'; whereas in the second case the work of the mind is marked by calm, comparative slowness and the absence of nervousness. What is there to get excited about, when there can be no violent explosions, no unforeseen tactical strokes or tricky traps? The mind is occupied with formulating plans for regrouping and moving about with the pieces with the almost total absence of variations. Only at certain specific moments do tactics come to the surface, causing the grandmaster to work out a few variations before reverting again to general considerations. We shall revert later to the question of the mind of a grandmaster, but I ask the reader to read carefully through these lines and grasp firmly the difference in thought patterns. This point is very important in clarifying the rules for thinking about moves and handling your clock properly. If you make plans in sharp tactical positions, you can easily fall into a trap that figures in the calculations you failed to make. Vice versa, if you are going to calculate variations in positions where you should be thinking about general planning, you will waste precious time and will not get the right orientation. So let us commit firmly to memory the fact that the mind of a grandmaster is principally occupied, in combinative-tactical positions, with the calculation of variations; in manoeuvring-strategical positions, with the formulation of general plans and considerations. 27 -Nc3 a4 Black has been successful at defending himself on the Q-side so Taimanov now transfers his attention to the K-side.

What strikes you when working through this game? The answer must be the absence of a tactical clash. For a very long time there were just strategical manoeuvres and re-forming ranks. Moreover there were practically no variations to consider as you can see from the notes to the game. When playing such a game an experienced grandmaster would never start working out variations. He would weigh up one or two short lines and that's it! In such positions general considerations prevail:- where should a certain piece be transferred to, how to stop some particular action by the opponent. Finally which piece to exchange, which one to keep on the board. Hence we can draw a simple and clear conclusion. There are two main types of position, and resulting from that, two different kinds of struggle. In the one case we get a constant clash of pieces mixing it in tricky patterns, with tactical blows, traps, sometimes unexpected and shattering moves. In the other case it is quite different. The respective armies stand at a distance from each other, the battles are restricted to reconnaissance and minor sorties into the enemy position. The thrust of the attacking side is prepared slowly with the aid of piece regrouping and 'insignificant' pawn advances. We may call positions of the first type combinative-tactical, of the second type manoeuvring-strategical. W e have distinguished two types of position according to the presence or absence of sharp contact, critical moments and threats of 'explosions': The two games we have just looked at are extreme examples of the types of struggle which can arise. To bring out the difference between them even

more graphically, we shall try to indicate their course by a schematic diagram. On the diagram below we have the depiction of the Euwe-Alekhine game, a wavy line full of zig-zags (No. 1).

The position is most complex, and naturally no general considerations can help a player to find his way in such great complications. You simply must work out variations, and both sides have to make the great effort to seek the best line for each side by means of analysis of the many possibilities. 18 . . . ' x!7 19 gh3 a6

Such a 'calm after the storm' is seen in the next game and we depict it in No. 3.

Why have we made such a distinction? We wish to illustrate the nature of a grandmaster's thinking process during a game, and how the rhythm of this thinking changes in accordance with the nature of the position which lies in front of him. So we have established one of the major features that guides a grandmaster. If he faces a combinative-tactical position, he deals with it by working out variations, using general considerations only at certain rare moments. In manoeuvring-strategical positions he restricts himself to general considerations, though here too he has recourse at times to short analysis of variations. Finally he has the flexibility to change from one approach to another as appropriate. Now what do general considerations consist ol? We now devote a great deal of attention to this vital question which lies at the bottom of all positional play. The Basic Postulates of Positional Play The level of development of positional sense depends on many factors. Most of all it is shown in the ability of a player by dint of natuial ability to determine swiftly, at one swoop, the main characteristics of a position. Chess history knows many examples of the ability to sniff out the essence of a position without the player having to trouble himself with wearisome analytical effort. Such cases reveal a real natural gift. Yet the main thing that develops positional judgement, that perfects it and makes it many-sided, is detailed analytical work, sensible tournament practice, a self-critical attitude to your games an a rooting out of all the defects in your play. This is the only way to learn to analyse chess positions and to assess them properly. Mastery only comes after you have a wide ex-

perience of studying a mass of chess positions, when all the laws and devices employed by the grandmasters have become your favoured weapons too. Positional sense is like the thread that leads you through the labyrinth in your tense struggle at the board from the first opening move to the final stroke in the endgame. When people come to say about you that you have a good positional sense, you will be able to consider yourself a well-rounded and promising player. We shall now try to state in a systematic way all the postulates and rules of middlegame play that have been worked out by theoreticians over the long history of chess. They might appear elementary to the discriminating reader. Whv bother to repeat what has long been known? Believe me, for all my long practical experience of play and writing, I have found it far from easy to reduce to a common denominator all that has been expressed so far in chess history. Moreover what is elementary? When I pose this question 1 call to mind Mikhail Tai. The ex-world champion has often commented that he regularly watches the chess lessons on TV meant for lower rated players. His idea is that the repetition of the elements can never do any harm, but rather polishes up the grandmaster's thoughts. For greater clarity we shall try to express the concepts of middlegame theory in short exactly formulated points. /. hi chess only the attacker wins. Of course there arc cases where it is the defender who has the point marked up for him in the tournament table, but this is only when his opponent exceeds the time limit or makes a bad mistake--overlooks mate, or loses a lot of material. Moreover, if one follows strict logic, even after this loss of material the game could be played out to mate and in this case the final victory goes to the former defender who in the later stages, after his opponent's mistake, is transformed into the attacker. The question then arises, which of the two players has the right to attack. Before the time of the first world champion Wilhelm Steinitz, who is the creator of modern chess theory, it was held that the more talented player attacked. Steinitz put it quite differently. The talent and playing strength of a chess player was a secondary consideration.
2. The right to attack is enjoyed by that player who has the better position.
Ifvour position is inferior, even though you are a genius, you do better not to think of attacking, since such an attempt can only worsen your position.
3. The side with the advantage has not only the right but also the duly Io attack,
otherwise he runs the risk oj losing his advantage. This is another postulate of Steinitz, and practice knows very many The Basic Postulates oj Positional Play 23 examples confirming it. How often has temporising, missing the appropriate moment to press, losing a few tempi, led to the loss of advantage, often of great advantage? Attack is the effective means in chess, it is the way to victory. Where does this leave the defender? Here too Steinitz has wise advice to give.
4. The defender must be prepared to defend, and to make concessions.
That means that the defender must try to repulse the attacker's blows, anticipate his intentions. Later theoreticians have added the rider to Steinitz that the defender must not leave out of his calculations the possibility of a counter strike, the chance to go over to counter-attack at the appropriate time. Defence thus means subjecting yourself for a time to the will of your opponent. From that comes the well-known fact that it is a lot harder to defend than to attack. Then the question arises, what means of attack are at the disposal of a player, and what should be chosen as the object of attack?
5. The means oj attack in chess are twofold, combinative and strategical.
As we have seen, attacks may develop with or without immediate contact between the forces. Which method is appropriate? The answer is best indicated by the nature of the position you are dealing with. Often it depends on the nature of the opening you have chosen, on the style of the players, but the decisive say lies with the position. No temperament no matter how passionate can produce an 'explosion' in a stabilized position, and attempts to do this can only rebound upon the instigator. Finally the question arises, where should the attack be made, and the answer is clear:
6. The attack must be directed at the opponent's weakest spot.
This almost goes without saying. Who would be foolish enough to attack a position at its strongest point? 'Why attack a lion when there is a lamb in the field?' The grandmaster seeks to direct his attack against the weakest, most sensitive, spot in the enemy fortifications. So we see how many difficult problems pose themselves to the grandmaster in the middlegame. Should he attack or defend? To answer this he has to establish whether he or the opponent has the advantage, but that is not ail. Even when you have settled the first question and established who has the right land correspondingly i the duty to attack, vou have to seek out the opponent's most \ ulnerable spot. The procedure to determine these questions is termed positional assessment, and we shall now consider this important topic in depth.

The player who wishes to improve, who wants to win in competitive play, must develop his ability to assess positions, and on that basis to work out plans for what comes next. This work of analysis can be compared to that of a chemist who is trying to determine the nature of a substance. Once upon a time the process was carried out in rough and ready fashion by visual inspection. Then Mendeleyev discovered the periodic table of elements and after that the chemist merely had to break down the substance into its constituent elements in order to determine the exact nature of the substance before him. That is the way chess players work now. About a century and a half ago the best players of the time solved their problems by visual inspection on the basis of their experience. There was no scientific method about this, but then came Stcinitz's theory. Thereby the player gained a basis for rational analysis suitable for solving whatever problems were posed, no matter how intricate the position. Steinitz taught players most of all to split the position into its elements. Naturally they do not all play the same role in a given position, they do not have the same importance. Once he has worked out the relationship of the elements to each other, the player moves on to the process of synthesis which is known in chess as the general assessment. When he has carried out the synthesis, has assessed the position, the grandmaster proceeds to the next step, when he draws up his plan for what follows. We shall deal with this later, and restrict ourselves to he statement that every plan is intimately linked with assessment. The analysis and assessment enables the player to find the wrcak point in the enemy camp, after which his thoughts will naturally be directed towards exploiting this weakness with the aid of a deeply thought out plan of campaign which takes account of the slightest nuances of the given position. In defining the elements there is no. perfect agreement amongst chess theorists. Each writer has his own list. It seems to us that the following 'Mendeleyev' table of chess elements will be sufficient to cover all those smaller parts out of which the analysis of a position is made up. Table of Elements Permarun / Advanluges
1 Material advantage.
2 Poor opponent's king position.
3 Passed pawns.
We have already spoken of Stcinitz's view that a win should not be played for if there is no confidence that the position contains some advantage or other. The question then arises, what does this advantage consist oP Steinitz gives the detailed and concrete reply, 'An advantage can consist ol one large advantage, or a number of small advantages.' He then adds the important guide to further action: 'The task of the positional player is systematically to accumulate slight advantages and try to convert temporary advantages into permanent ones, otherwise the player with the better position runs the risk of losing it.' 4 his is a valuable piece of advice, stressing that elements vary not just in their importance but in the length of their lifetime. Some are long term or permanent, others are temporary and either change (becoming greater or smaller) or disappear altogether. Il we arc a sound pawn up, or if the opponent's K-side is seriously weakened, then we enjoy a long term advantage. If, however, we have a lead in development or there is a badly placed piece in the enemy camp, then this is a short term advantage and can easily be dissipated in the subsequent play. Of course it is not possible to draw a fixed line between the twelve elements which we Jtave defined as permanent and the five we give as temporary. For example an open file or diagonal can be closed by means of an exchange of pawns and material inequality can be restored to equality, but the division we have made1 is a sufficiently good guide in our judgement and decision taking processes. This is the appropriate place to sum up Stcinitz's positional rules in the
26 Positional Judgement
form of short laconic summaries such as we encounter in mathematics, physics and other exact sciences. It is a matter of some surprise that no-one has done this before. We suggest the following form of words for them. Sleinilz's Pour Rules. 1 .The right to attack belongs only to that side which has a positional advantage, and this not just a right, but also a duty, otherwise there is the risk of losing the advantage. The attack is to be directed against the weakest spot in the enemy position.
2. The defending side must be prepared to defend and to make
concessions.
3. In level positions the two sides manoeuvre, trying to tilt the balance of
the position, each in his own favour. With correct play by both sides, level positions keep on leading to further level positions.
4. The advantage may consist of a large advantage in one form or
element only, or of a number of small advantages. The task of the positional player is to accumulate small advantages and to try to turn these small advantages into permanent ones. These four rules of Steinitz can be of great help and serve as a guiding thread for every player in his positional battles. However we should point out straight away the harm that arises if these rules are turned into strict dogmas: The Russian school, while recognizing the importance of Steinitz's teachings and the usefulness of his rules, always favours a concrete approach to assessment of a position with due regard for dynamic features. One other practical point. We have enumerated seventeen elements of a chess position, but during actual play a player would not find it too easy to consider each of the seventeen at every point. The grandmaster is helped out of this dilemma by the fact that usually not all the elements apply to a given position. There might well be only five to seven of them relevant. We recommend the following approach; as a rule consider a.restricted number of grouped elements. The following is a grouping of elements that has been proved most useful in practice:-
1. Weak squares and pawns.
2. Open lines.
3. 1 he centre and space.
4. Piece position.
The last named consists of such factors as king position, development, harmony of position, and the bad placing of one piece. The Elements in Practice 27 So in practice we need consider these four only, with the proviso that if we discern some other element, say the two bishops, then we add this to our assessment. The Elements in Practice Let us now take practical examples from actual play in which analysis and assessment were carried out. Normally there is a mixture of factors involved, an advantage in one element may be compensated for by the opponent enjoying an advantage in another element. All this has to be weighed up, comparing the significance of each element. However it may also be the case that one of the elements suddenly assumes decisive significance and confers a clear advantage. We shall start with such positions. Weak Squares Weak squares can be defined in essence as those squares which cannot be protected by pawns. Of course from a practical point of view we have a wider concept depending a great deal on the actual position: thus a square can sometimes be considered weak even when it can be protected by a pawn, but only with a serious weakening of position. In assessing any position a grandmaster is bound to take account of weak squares, both his own and those in the enemy camp. Moreover it is often the case that he starts his assessments from here: a number of weak squares, or even a single weak square, can be the outstanding feature of the position. A piece that gets established on this weak point spreads confusion in the defence and decides the issue. Botvinnik-Flohr, Moscow, 1936. Even a first glance at diagram 6 will show that all other weak squares
28 Positional Judgement The Elements in Practice 29
and other positional factors recede into the background by comparison with the gaping 'hole' at d6. Obviously a knight established there will play a decisive role, and Botvinnik plays to get his knight to the square he has prepared for it. X pawn can be proved to be weak, however, only when it can be attacked. The reader should take particular note of the following comments by Bronstein when talking about the position of diagram 7, which arises in a well-known variation of the King's Indian Defence. 34 £bl f8

44 ge3 <S>17 45 c4 'It seems it is time to reveal here the secret of the pawn at d6 in the King's Indian Defence. Although this pawn is on an open Hie and is apparently subject to attack, yet it is still a tough nut to crack. It is hard to get at. What w'ould seem easier than moving the knight at d4 away, but the point is that the knight is badly needed at d4. Its task there is to observe the squares b5, c6, e6, and 15 as well as neutralizing the bishop at g7. The knight can only move away from the centre after White has prepared to meet Black's various threats (a4-a3. JL<8-c6, f7 -15) but during the time taken bv these preparations Black will be able to reform his ranks. Hence the weakness of the d6 pawn turns out to be imaginary. Modern methods of playing the opening know of many such imaginary weaknesses, yet it was the supposed "permanent" weakness at d6 that long condemned the King's Indian Defence as "dubious".' Hence we urge you to attack weak pawns, but at the same time you have to have a critical and creative attitude to even the most obvious pawn weaknesses! White misses a tactical stroke and thus makes his win more difficult. By playing his king first to gl he could follow his plan without allowing any tactical tricks. 45 . . . b5!

Weak Pawns Th ere are many types of weak pawns: backward pawns, isolated pawns, doubled pawns, pawns far advanced and as a result cut off from contact with 'base'. All are spoken of as weak pawns, even though for the moment there is adequate protection from the pieces. After all the pieces might go away, leaving the pawn to its fate. Diagram 8 shows a critical moment in Gligoric-Szabo, Candidates Tournament, Zurich, 1953. Bronstein comments thus: -'Black has the advantage since the a5 paw n is weak, and the pawns at e5 and 14 limit the scope of the bishop.' There now came:

Pawn Islands There should be no need to stress that a comradely united pawn mass is the best sort of pawn configuration. Then every foot soldier senses the presence of his mate by his shoulder and receives the appropriate support and reinforcement when needed. It is a different state of affairs when the pawns are ripped into fragments. Then there is no hope of help since the other pawns cannot jump the ditch separating them. That is why the presence of a number of pawn islands is a serious drawback that can lead to defeat. In assessing diagram 10 (Gligoric-Kcres, 1953 Candidates Tournament) Bronstein wrote in the tournament book: 'White is well dug in, but Black's advantage is of a permanent nature and is expressed not so much in the active nature of this or that piece, but in his better pawn configuration. Concretely this consists of: - a. All Black's pawns are linked in a single branch, while White's are weakened.

Keres-Stahlbcrg, Zurich, 1953 b. The pawns at d5 and f5 ensure Black's knight a post at e4. If White exchanges the knight on that square then a protected passed pawn ensues. c. If Black can win the pawn at a4 then his own passed a- pawn will play through to queen unhindered. White already has a passed pawn at h3, but this cannot advance since White's pieces are not in a position to support it. These principal features of the position are sufficient explanation of the fact that Black attacks all the time while White must merely repel threats.

The rooks and queen use them to attack weak pawns and to get into the heart of the enemy position. The control of an open file is a big positional plus. Bronstein comments on the position of diagram 1 1, 'An open file is worth something when there are objects of attack on it, or when the line serves as an avenue of communication for transferring pieces, normally the rooks, to the main point of battle. In this case the f-file fits both criteria. The main point is that it is close to the king which is a cause of alarm for Stahlberg. In the diagram position Black has the choice of using his rooks on either the c- or d-filcs, while White operates on the f-file. We get a sharp struggle and it gradually becomes clear that the f-filc carries more weight than the two files open for Black's use. 16 . . . c5 17 el Ac4 18 gf4 Ag6

Open Ranks The importance of ranks is usually smaller than that of files and diagonals. 5 ct occasionally it is a rank which turns out to be the highway along which decisive manoeuvres are carried out. Open Diagonals What has been said about open files applies by and large to open diagonals. Thev arc weighty factors in assessing the chances in complex positions, and there arc cases where a single diagonal proves decisive.
W
Karpov-Hort, Moscow, 1971 Not only a superficial analysis but even a very attentive study of the position of diagram 13 might find it hard to spot the decisive positional element which guarantees the advantage for White. The point is that here White can make good use of the ranks. Medina-Botvinnik, Palma, 1967. Botvinnik assessed the chances in diagram 12 thus, 'It is clear that despite the exchanges and material equality White is positionally lost, as he has no counter to Black's pressure along the al /h8 diagonal. Black's main idea was based on a tactical finesse, namely that after 21 gd7 gad8 22 ghdl (or 22 gxf7 gxf7 23 xe6 22 . . . gxd7 23 gxd7 gl + 24 gdl? ,.Q xb2+ Black gets a material advantage.

30 gael and White duly won. The Two Bishops Supporters of a concrete approach to the assessment of chess positions often deny the advantage of two bishops over bishop and knight or two knights. However this is not quite correct. It is certainly impossible to allege that the bishops arc always an advantage in every position, but in the great majority it is better to have the two bishops: then when the position opens up, the bishops will get favourable diagonals and their significance can decide matters. Diagram 15 may be considered a classical example of 'prelate power.' Smyslov -Keres, Zurich, 1953 In diagram 14, White's advantage is undeniable, principally because of his lead in development. Almost all his pieces arc in play while the enemy king is stuck in the centre. To exploit this there came: 14 d5! The pawn cannot be taken and there is a threat of 15 de.

Space This factor needs little stressing, and is a positional element that a grandmaster is bound to take into account when assessing the position. If one side occupies the greater part of the board, his men cramp the enemy forces and drive them to the edge of the board. Of course one has to take into account the possibilities of counter play, but if this advantage in space is consolidated it may lead to victory. 4 #xe5 Alb

We shall come across a numbej of such cases later on, but let us consider Poor Position oj a Piece An active position for the pieces is one of the most important elements of the positional struggle, possibly the decisive one. That is why in assessing any position it is vital to assess the position of the pieces, and not just the overall placing of them, but each one considered separately. The following Capablanca-Bogoljubow, London, 1922

the play from diagram 18, a particularly instructive example. The Centre 43 side and the future course of events. Right from the start the beginner has it dinned into him that he should seize the centre and try to hold it with all his forces. This applies, he is taught, right from the opening, through the middlegame, down to the endgame. Later on we learn that only with a firm grip on the centre do we have the right to start active play on the wing, otherwise we run the risk that the oppo- nent might be able to produce an unexpected counter-strike in the centre, after which our attack will become pointless. We are told by theoreticians about the various problems involving the centre, how the old masters con- sidered every pawn centre good, whereas the hypermoderns of early this century declared that piece pressure on the centre could be more effective than occupying it with pawns which might become weak and need defending. We shall soon deal with this problem, but first let us note the axiom that the reader must understand and assimilate: the pawn formation in the centre determines the general nature of the whole struggle. Theory recognises five sorts of centre:-
1 A Pawn Centre, 2 A Fixed Centre, 3 An Open Centre, 4 A Closed
Centre, 5 A Centre under Tension. Let us examine these in turn. The Pawn Centre When we have two or more pawns in the centre and the opponent does not have any, we are naturally justified in seeking to advance these pawns and sweep away the opponent's fortifications. He in his turn will put obstacles in our way, possibly attacking the pawns with his pieces so that our pawns may become weak or be removed from the board altogether. Hence we get the problem of piece pressure on the centre-the chief hobby horse in the teachings of the chess Hypermodernists. The resolution of this problem depends on concrete assessment: if the central pawns are strong and well supported then the pawn centre gives us a positional advantage, but if the pawns are weak then they are a serious drawback.

Botvinnik-Yudovich, USSR Ch. 1933 Clearly Black has placed his pieces badly. His bishop at c8 has not yet moved, and the knights hinder his own development. Only the other bishop is well placed, firing along an open diagonal, but what can it do on its own? At the same time White's pieces can boast of their excellent placing and his pawns arc particularly proud, ready to advance and cramp Black even more. It takes only a few moves for Botvinnik to demonstrate the advantage of his forces by carrying out a nice concluding attack. 11 • •c7

In diagram 20, the pawns are jammed up against each other at e4 /e5. If we examine in turn the role of each piece we come to the conclusion that of Black's pieces only the queen is active. White hurries to exchange this piece and at the same time he makes a safe defence for his d4 square.

In view of the open terrain the whole emphasis is on piece play. Bear in mind that in such cases flank attacks with pawns are ruled out. With an open centre, the likelihood of an enemy central strike is so great that a flank pawm advance is equivalent to suicide.

The Closed Centre This type of centre is marked by pawn masses jammed up against each other closing the files and cutting off diagonals. As the centre cannot be broken open the players prepare to by-pass it, manoeuvring and pressing on the flank. With the centre closed and no risk of a quick counter there, the bold advance of wing pawns is quite safe. Diagram 22 is an instructive example: If' Reti-Carls, Baden-Baden, 1925 Reti-Capablanca, New York, 1924 Having earlier foreseen the coming of a closed centre position, White is first to get in with an advance on the K-side.

If the two sides remove all the centre pawns then we get an open centre; if the pawns get jammed then we have a closed centre. Sometimes we may get a fixed centre, rarely a mobile one. The policy of the players in a fluid situation is to manoeuvre and wait for a suitable opportunity to turn the centre into one of the other four forms in the hope that this will turn to their own advantage.

I n practice it is more often the case that we have to deal with positions in which there is no clearly marked plus in any one element: each player stands better than his opponent in one respect, but worse in another. So we get a clash of elements with plusses in some elements being compensated for by minuses in others, and there is a tense struggle to accumulate small advantages. The practical player thus needs not only attentiveness and the ability to Bolcslavsky Kcres, Candidates Tournament 1953 Diagram 23 shows a fluid centre.

analyse a position, but must also show considerable objectivity in assessing the elements of the position. If you are going to consider your plusscs as a real treasure house and denigrate those of the opponent, you are heading for catastrophe. Objectivity in your approach to the position is a most important quality so that you can properly orientate yourself in the tasks of analysis, assessment, and finding the. right plan. A grandmaster pays attention to every slight detail and tries not to miss the slightest nuance, the least factor which might affect the assessment. Here arc examples of such scrupulous care: Smyslov-Botvinnik, USSR Absolute Ch. 1941 Botvinnik assesses diagram 25 'A quick glance is sufficient to note the weak side of White's position. His bishops are not very active, Black has a good base for operations at 15. Moreover one should not omit to note an organic defect of White's pawn formation-his Q-sidc can communicate with the K-side only via the cl square.' We may comment that it is no simple thing to spot such a 'trifle' which turns out not to be a trifle! Euwc-Kcres, Candidates Tournament 1953 Bronstein wrote this about the position of diagram 24: 'Every positional achievement, in this case the pawn at d6 which engages the attention of the black pieces, is important not in itself but in its link with other combinational factors. In this position the factors for White are:-
1 The unguarded pawn at c5,
2 The weakened cover of the black king.
3 The constant possibility of advancing the pawn to d7.
4 Control over c7 and e7, combined with the attempt to control the c-
or c-filc. For Black the factors are:~
1 The chance to surround the d6 pawn from three sides.
2 The attack on the Q-side by a majority of pawns.
3 The possibility 4dh5 to drive the queen from her strong post.
B\ comparing and weighing the chances lor each side the masters normally reach more or less objective conclusions which arc called the assessment of the position.' Euwv now played 22 a3 which Bronstein criticized as not corresponding to the demands of the position. He recommends instead 22 b3 to put a Lasker-Capablanca, St. Petersburg, 1914 Let us assess diagram 26, a position from a famous game.

weaknesses in Black's position. White has weak squares too, at c4, f4 and h4, but these have little influence on the play since the enemy pieces cannot get at them. Black has gaping weaknesses at e6 and g6, while a5 and h5 are also weak. The weak pawn at 16 may become an object of attack, and this would soon prove telling. Another significant factor is White's advantage on the open files. His rooks are well established on the h-filc and can be transferred quickly to the a-file. Another minus in Black's position is the passive position of the bishop at b7, and there is no active diagonal to which it could be transferred. The active position of the white rooks means that they can at any moment get on to the poorly defended 7th rank. Also White has an undoubted advantage in space due to the advanced pawn at 15, and the knight at e6 is firmly stuck in the heart of the enemy position. All White's pieces are actively placed, whereas the black men laze about on the back two rows. Although White has some weak points, White's plusses in various respects give us the right to make the assessment that White has a won position. By the laws of strategy, White is here under an obligation to attack, otherwise he risks losing his advantage. If White were to do nothing here then Black would go 4T c4-e5, then ge7 and Q c8 to drive out or exchange the intrusive knight and the position would become quite defensible. The great strategist Lasker uses the advantages of his position to start the decisive thrust. 1 e5! I he idea is clear. He activates his knight at c3 and starts an attack on the weak pawn at 16. After the capture on e5 the knights get access to c5 from where they become dominating. The pawn sacrifice is temporary, as White can visualize that Black will soon have to lose material. 1 . . . de Capture by the other pawn would lead to the early loss of the g5 pawn and the formation of united passed pawns for White at 15 and g4. 2 £je4 Nd5

A method of assessing positions is frequently found in Capablanca's notes both to his own games and to others. Bogoljubow-Wahltuch, London 1922 Capablanca wrote of diagram 27, 'It is not hard to assess this position. Force is equal, but Black has three weak pawns- the a, c, and e. The a7 pawn would be strong and a source of worry to White if there was the time to advance it far down the board safely, but this is not the case, so it is merely a weakness. The only positive feature of Black's position is the fact that his rook occupies an open file. If the bishop could be transferred from e8 to d5 via c6 it would defend two weak pawns and exert pressure on the long diagonal. Then Black's position would not be too bad. However this is not feasible as White will play, Ba4 as his first move. W'hitc has no weak points. His wcdgelike pawn formation is very aggressive, and he has adequate space for piece manoeuvres. So it is clear that White must have the advantazge. As we have already said, his first move will be Jia 4 to exchange the enemy bishop and prevent it moving to d5, so that it could defend the weak pawns at c4 and e6.

In his notes to games Robert Fischer normally gives more interesting variations than verbal reasoning, but this certainly does not mean that in thinking about his moves during actual play he avoids general considerations and overall assessments. Possibly these are simply less necessary for him in view of his intuition and the immense analytical effort which he put in at the time of his passionate enthusiasm for the game. However in his notes too you can find valuable general assessments. The eleventh world champion wrote of diagram 29 thus; 'Petrosian and Tai both happened to stroll by the board at this instant. Petrosian made a wry face which looked to me like "Can Black do this and live?". Black's ugly defence is based on sound positional considerations; once he can consolidate there is a strong potential in the two bishops coupled with his beautifully posted knight and compact pawn mass. These assets in the long run, hopefully, should outweigh the temporary weakness of his king and the immobile target on e6.' 14 £ce2! Qh8

move makes way for the queen, which will penetrate into Black's position via a2.' The reader will note some features of the Cuban champion's method of assessment. He does not go through the elements we had in our table, but only deals with the main ones which determine the nature of the position and the development of subsequent events. Nor does he restrict himself to a static statement, as is shown by his inclusion of the move Qa4, and he puts the final touch to White's stated advantage by indicating the possible lines for both sides-Black's advance of the a-pawn and White's penetration with his queen via a2. Here is an exact and clear verbal assessment of diagram 28 by Smyslov. Smyslov-Golombek USSR-GB match, 1954 'White's advantage is minimal, and consists of the strong king position in the centre, while his bishop is more active than Black's which is rather shut in at b8. The slight separation of the pawns at e6, g6, h7 makes Black's task more difficult.' White played 33 £dl and Smyslov makes a more exact assessment by linking it with White's plan. 'The c3 square is freed to let the bishop take the important diagonal al /h8, while the knight sets off to g4 to attack the enemy pawns. White does not fear e5 since he would answer f5 and then find it easier to create a passed pawn on the flank.

the game I found out that this move had surprised the audience. Indeed its drawback is obvious- the square d4 becomes White's domain. But I hasten to add that this is only so in words. After all White will not be able to derive any benefit from having a queen, or say, rook on d4. As for the knight which it is normally advantageous to place on such blockading squares, its main care here is to guard the e5 pawn. Hence Black has his hands untied so that he can now operate on the g-file.' The subsequent play confirmed the correctness of this concrete assessment.

When we considered Steinitz's rules we noted that the Soviet school, while recognizing his teaching, also puts a high price on a concrete approach to each position. Diagram 30 is one example that could be quoted from very many. Spassky-Petrosian, World Ch. match 1966 Karpov-Spassky, USSR Spartakiad, 1975 Petrosian played 17 . . . c4 here and later wrote abou.t it: "Right after The Mind of a Grandmaster 59 The reader will see that the world champion not only works out his assessments on the basis of the elements which we enumerated, but links them organically w'ith the concrete features of the actual position. The Mind of a Grandmaster The time has come to deal with the question of when a grandmaster carries out his analysis and assessment of the position, and how this process takes place in his mind. The first crucial moment is normally when we come to the end of the opening and start the middle game. After a theoretical variation has been plaved, or when the pieces have been mobilized in accordance with our own ideas, the time is ripe for the first overall assessment. 11 is al this point that a grandmaster spends a great deal of time, since it is from here that the whole future course of the game may be mapped out. We recommend that at this point the whole position is considered from the point of view of the elements and their influence on the play. The main question to answer is, who stands better. Obviously, as laid down in Stcinitz's rules, the player with the better position will have to attack and the inferior side will have to defend. Then must be established where the weakest enemy point is, since this is the place where we will direct our attack. Next it is time to form a plan for the next few moves, a point we shall deal with later. With his general problems settled the grandmaster then normally begins the analysis of concrete variations, their depth depending on the nature of the position. A sort of interior dialogue takes place each move, a dialogue of the following sort:- 'I go knight to c5, he retreats the queen. I advance the pawn to d5. He can't take it since then the centre is opened. He has to reply c6-c5. Then I play c.2-c4. What a fine knight I have in the centre, and a protected passed pawn into the bargain.' Thus it goes every move, with each new problem to be solved. Examine the notes of the best grandmasters to their games and you will find both deep general assessments, and routine small assessments at nearly every move. There arc other times too when a general assessment will be needed - at the transition from the middle game to the endgame, or when combinational storms end. At such times the position has to be looked at afresh and a new assessment formed. We recommend you to try and divide the playing time into 'my time' and 'his time' and follow the golden rule that when your clock is going you restrict yourself to the analysis of variations, while when the opponent's

After this, attention should be concentrated on the link between overall assessment and the lesser assessments made each move. Once again grandmasters' notes to games wall be a guide. Notice how at a critical point the annotator will enumerate all the elements of a given position and describe their interaction, working out the relative worth of each. Then you will see that he goes on by giving short variations at each move accompanied by verbal assessments. These short comments are a result of the overall assessment and of the analysis of the factors brought about by the opponent's last move. While seeking improvement along these lines, be aiming to cultivate the knack of seeing at a glance which of the elements are crucial to a given position, which arc irrelevant and play no part. Training is also possible during actual play. Observe yourself from the side, as it were, and check whether you are able to discipline yourself to useful work at the board. This applies particularly to our recommendation about the different nature of thought according to whether it is our clock or that of the opponent that is going. Avoid the criminal waste of time that arises from the confusion of these two types of thought and that can easily lead to time trouble. Observe too how the stronger players behave at the board, how they suddenly fall into deep thought as they carry out a general assessment, how they still sit at the board thinking when it is not their turn to move. We know what they are doing- they are solving general problems, formulating verbal summaries of the position and planning ahead.
EXERCISES
clock is going you consider general questions to do with the position- overall assessment and planning. Of course there are exceptions, if it is a question of a tactical struggle with one main line that must be probed deeply. Then there are those grandmasters who like to walk around when it is not their turn to move. However there is the example of Botvinnik (and Fischer) who rarely get up from the board, but sit there all the playing time. I tried to follow Botvinnik's example, and found it hard since I am not that sort of character. However when I managed it my results greatly improved. Of course there is the complication that 'my time' is controlled by me, whereas I have no control over how long or short a time the opponent thinks with his clock running. Thus it may be that general considerations may have to be thought about during 'my time', especially if you are up against a quick player. Nevertheless try and follow the rule given above. Go through detailed variations in your own time, think in a general way about the position in the opponent's time and you will soon find that you get into time trouble less often, that your games have more content to them, and that their general standard rises. How to Train In striving to train, to improve in positional judgement, you should bear in mind the two sides of it:- training at home, and training during an actual competition game. As regards the former, you have to analyse many games and positions and try to divide them into types according to the different elements mentioned in our 'Mendeleyev' table. You should be aiming for a thorough understanding of each element and its link with the others. It would be useful if the results of this home training were w ritten dowm in special notebooks, with each element being allotted an appropriate amount of space. In studying the interaction of the elements, there are few better ways than going through notes to games by theoreticians who do not give just a list of variations, but provide a systematic explanation of the ideas of each game and how they arc linked with the concrete variations. The author can recommend a few' books of this sort, notably the three volume collection of Botvinnik's games and Bronstein's book 'The International Grandmasters Tournament' on the 1953 Candidates Tournament.* * fr. Note. The best of Botvinnik's notes to his games have been translated into English, notably in "One Hundred Selected Games" (MacGibbon and Kee) and Botvinniks Best Games 1947-1970", Batsford, 1972.

ir Give a verbal assessment. Indicate the weak points for each side. Make a few moves for each side which arise logically from the position. Black played 14 . . . 4d x d4 here. Assess the move. What positional factors are changed by this exchange in the centre? Which weaknesses does White thereby get rid of? Does the move give White the advantage? If so, formulate exactly what this consists of. What is the strength of White's position? What moves will exploit Black's weaknesses? Indicate how the play should go. Where is Black weakest? Which diagonal particularly interests White? How can White exploit his opponent's weaknesses, which moves will he play? What is the way for Black to get full control of the black squares in the centre? How will play develop? Analyse and assess. What should White be aiming for with his next few moves? Which moves will enable him to achieve this aim? Make a detailed verbal summary of the position. What plusses docs White enjoy? And Black? How do you think the play will go? Which of the lines (file, diagonal, rank) on the board is White's weakest? How can Black exploit this? Indicate the way the play will go-

Does W hite have the advantage here? Indicate Black's weak point. Show in a concrete fashion how to exploit this. Analyse and assess. Who has the advantage and what does it consist of? W'hat plan would you form for Black? Types of Plan Once assessment has been carried out the aims of each side become clearer. The player will work out what he must undertake in the next few moves, which manoeuvres he must make and where, which regrouping is called for. In short, we are now in the phase of planning. The nature of the position will suggest the sort of thought processes that will be necessary. If there is a combinational-tactical position, then we will normally make some such formulation as, 'I must attack on the K-sidc.', or 'I must undermine the enemy pawn chain at all costs.' Then this is backed up by more detailed analysis of concrete variations. If we have a manoeuvring-strategical position, then concrete variations arc reduced to a minimum and the main emphasis is put on as detailed a plan as possible. One absolute rule may already be stated:- it is impossible to play chess without a plan. One chess sage put it thus, 'A sound plan makes us all heroes, the absence of a plan -idiots.' Another commented, 'Better a bad plan than no plan at all.' Yet another, 'The player who will lose is the one without a plan. It is better to have a shallow or even faulty plan than just make moves not knowing what you are doing.' Planless play is thus fatal, as we can prose by a host of examples. Here is just one (44). Bronstein commented here, 'The opening is o\ er and both sides have to form a concrete plan. Yet instead of doing something active, White starts running on the spot and tries for "pressure'' on the backward pawn by not letting it advance to c5. Yet the real point is that Black does not intend to advance this far since on c6 the pawn will be guarded by just one bishop, while White will be putting it under pressure all the time with two rooks. As a result Black gets superiority of force at those parts of the board where the real battle is to be decided.' Analyse and assess. What docs White's advantage consist of? What plan would you choose for White? Indicate the next few moves. Types of Plan 67 Here is a definition which correctly reflects the course of thought and action of a grandmaster:- 'The plan in a game of chess is the sum total of successive strategical operations which are each carried out according to separate ideas arising from the demands of the position.' Does a plan depend on our will, is it the fruit of our burning fantasy? Can I do as I like with my pieces on my board (or on my half of it)? No, that is a quite mistaken concept. As Steinitz pointed out almost a century ago every plan must have its justification, and this justification lies not in the personality of the player, but in the position lying before him. This is a very valuable definition which indicates to the player the way he has to go. 'The plan is based on assessment.' Hence it is not fantasy, but creative work that creates the plan. There seem to be two sorts of plan in practical play. To make this clearer we start with elementary endings ( 45).

Even a queen up you can't win unless you proceed according to plan. Here it runs thus, 'White with the aid of both pieces drives the king into a coi ner, or to the edge (but be careful not to give stalemate!) and then mates with the queen either guarded by the king or checking along the last line of the board.' Winning the endgame with bishop and knight against lone king is more complicated and ii is no accident that there are cases where a master has not found the right way (46) The win can only be forced by playing to a strict plan consisting of three stages:
1. All three pieces co-operate to drive the king to a corner opposite to the
colour of the bishop.
2. All three pieces again drive the king to the corner of the same colour as
the bishop, taking care that the king docs not slip out en route. Black has a formidable position and soon got ccisivc advantage. Despite inventive defence the Swedish master was forced to resign. What is a plan? Even nowadays you can read in some books that a plan in chess is something that the grandmaster thinks up almost from the first few moves (certainly immediately after the 'book' moves arc finished) and realizes right up to the last few moves. This is quite mistaken. We shall sec later that in exceptional circumstances it is possible to create and carry out such a plan 'from first to last', but in the majority of cases the grandmaster docs not do this, in fact he simply cannot. One-Stage Plans 69 be achieved by assessing the position correctly and forming a plan that arises from it. 6'8 Planning
3. While preventing the king from getting out of the corner, the three
attacking pieces are re-arranged to create one of several mating positions. In the first case the plan has only one stage. In the second there are three stages. It is best to speak of two sorts of plan generally--the single-stage plan and the multi-stage plan. This distinction is confirmed as a useful one by the examples wc shall consider. First, though, another theoretical distinction. In the end-game mates, the player knows not only what will happen in the first stage but in all subsequent stages? Of course he may not be able to say on which square mate will be given, but the general outline is clear all the way. It is useful to divide multi-stage plans into three types. The first is when the maker of the plan can state the tasks and aims of each stage. This is called the plan when 'everything is clear to the end.' Then there is the plan when the future is glimpsed but dimly as if through a smoke haze. This we call the plan when 'something can be seen;' and finally there is the plan when only the first stage is at all clear, when it is not known what will happen at the second and subsequent stages. This third type is named 'subsequent darkness'. Wc feel that this division will help the reader to follow more easily our account of planning in chess. Botvinnik-Tai, world title return match 1961. Consider diagram 47. White is a pawn up, but it is hard to make it tell. How many endgames with opposite coloured bishops have ended in a draw! The win can be achieved here only by a deeply thought out logical plan based not only on the exploitation of material advantage but also positional plusses. Botvinnik wrote as follows about his plan. 'White intends to open the K- side hoping that he will either penetrate with his rooks into the opponent's rear, or create another passed pawn.'

In more complicated examples, victory can only Now the pawn gets to a7 which makes Black's position hopeless. After other moves White would double rooks on the h-filc, and play Jlc3 which

Realizing Positional advantage A one-stage plan is often called for in order to make a positional advantage count. As in the previous example, the player with the initiative envisages a favourable regrouping and carries out the necessary manoeuvres. Karpov-Polugayevsky, Candidates Match 1974 Karpov-Andersson, Madrid, 1973 In this apparently simple position Karpov spotted the strategically correct plan which is as follows:- exploit the weakness of the enemy Q-side by placing his bishop on a6 and the queen on b5. Black is then tied down so that White can advance his pawns to create a passed pawn on the wing. With better placed pieces the threat to advance this pawn proves decisive.

No less important than forming a plan is sticking to it. After all the opponent will try to anticipate your intentions, foresee what your next moves will be. Naturally he will seek the earliest possible opportunity to branch off into something you have not expected in the hope of gaining from this unexpected turn. Kotov-Eliskases, Stockholm, 1952 White envisaged an effective plan from diagram 50 along these lines:- To strengthen my position I have to provoke weakness on the K-side in the enemy pawn formation, since only then will a pawn advance by me find something to 'latch on to'. So the rook has to slip back to the K-side, force one or two pawns to advance, then play back to the a-file and follow up with a K-side pawn advance. 25 g7a5! ghd8 26 gg5 16 27 gga5 4V8!

The great master of defence, Lasker, commented thus on diagram 52:- 'White has difficulties. The centre is closed and so here the knights are stronger than the bishops.1 Alekhine played 15 <£jh4, which Lasker assessed as follows:- 'When Alekhine recognizes the weaknesses in his position he has a tendency to become very aggressive. Patient defence is not for him if he can see the slightest chance of creating an attack. Yet sound strategy often demands that you submit to the opponent's will so as to strengthen your weaknesses and get rid of defects in your game. The right plan here was Rhl, 4bgl so as to defend h3; then g3, 13 and gf2. In that way all the K- sidc squares would be defended, including the fourth rank. If Black prepared an attack by 17-15 then White in his turn could play f3-f4 or take on 15. White should be reconciled to the fact that Black had the initiative. Strix ing to take this initiative from Black is the least appropriate way to play.'

There arc many games which have been saved, or even won, by clever defence. In my early days of learning the game I was greatly impressed by the defence put up by White in this position (53) Black had not taken account of this finesse.

It is no easy matter to have to fall in with the opponent's intentions, and that is why the defender's plan, just like his tactical operations, have to be very exact. Tarrasch-Alekhine, Pistyan, 1922 Black has given up a pawn in the Blumenfeld Counter Gambit to get a strong centre and attacking chances on the K-sidc. White has to consider the pressure along the f-filc, especially against 12. There are also nasty threats along the h2/b8 diagonal. Alekhinc-Bogoljubow, World Ch. Match 1934 Tarrasch thought up an excellent defensive plan to guard 12 and h2. The

0-1 In some games a sound defensive plan leads to positions in which the defender can go over to the counter attack. This possibility may form part of the plan from the start, in other cases it is a long-term prospect. White has carried out his plan, but even the finest play cannot save a bad position, especially against such a fine attacker as Alekhine. Black's next move indicates that not all the points in White's camp are defended and that there is the irreparable drawback for White'in that he cannot hold back the opponent's central pawn mass. 18 . . . g5!

White resigned here, since great material loss will follow Black's central breakthrough, especially in view of the fact that the king has not yet managed to hide' in the corner. Multi-Stage Plans We have already defined three sorts of multi-stage plan: when all the features are apparent to the planner; when only some details can be seen; and when nothing is clear after the first stage. Now we will consider each type in detail. Everything is clear to the end There are rare examples when a player can envisage all stages of his plan to the very end. The stages dovetail into each other, the aims are clear and the means also-which pieces are to be exchanged, which regrouped, which pawns to be advanced. on a7, where it will not interfere with or be endangered by his counter attack. 15 . . . 16 a4 Qd8 a5! 17 ga2 <$>c7 18 gh6 Sa6!

30 '&dl f4! (56) Alekhine-Chajes, Carlsbad, 1923 Alekhine outlined his plan from diagram 57 as follows:- The first stage is to bring the king to the centre, so that in the event of the exchange of major pieces it can threaten a quick penetration at a5. This will inevitably induce Black to bring his king over, especially since it is needed to defend e6 and c6. The second stage is to force Black's pieces one by one to leave the K-side by tactical threats to the king and to the enemy pawns (see the 39th and 41st moves). The threat of Ne5 will tie the enemy knight to d7, which will hinder still further the mobility of Black's pieces which are already lacking in space.
80 Planning Multi-Stage Plans 81
The third stage is to double rooks on the h-file at a time when Black's forces are farthest away from the K-side. Then after an exchange of queens and bishops, the rooks will force an entry into the rear of the enemy position. As Alekhine pointed out, no less than 28 moves were needed to bring the whole plan to fruition! 33 . . . 4dg6 34 £}d3 34 <g"e2? e5! 34 . . .

From the position of diagram 59, Smyslov carried out a multi-stage plan to exploit his extra pawn, which is doubled, but central. Black's advantage consists of his control over the central squares d4, d5, c5, f4 and f5. White has control of the Q-file and a paw n majority on the Q-side which provide him with counter chances. Smyslov's plan consisted of these stages:-
1. Exchange one pair or rooks at once, and leave the other on, ready to
counter White's Q-side pawns and to attack the pawns at c4 and e4.
2. Use the threat of creating a distant passed pawn to divert the enemy
rook to the h-file, and use his rook on the d-file.
3. Undermine the support of the e4 pawn by g7-g5-g4.
4. Tie down White's pieces by attacking the e4 pawn.
White has carried out the first two stages. Black's pieces have been diverted to the Q-side by the need to defend against various threats there. This has left the K-side without adequate defence. 47 . . . Nd7

The retreat 45b 1 enables c3 to be played and then 45b1 d2-f3 will eject the bishop, though care must be taken to play >h2 as well so as not to let it settle at g.3. The first stage then is clear.

Neither side has any marked weakness; control of open lines is also about level. Flohr formed a long plan whose main aim was to get his knight to e4. Then he envisaged co-ordinating his pieces for an attack on the K-side.

The great Capablanca probably only saw the vague outlines of subsequent events when he made his plan to regroup his pieces in diagram 64, a position from a famous game. The plan was as follows:- Withdraw the bishop to d7 to support the advance b5. This pawn will provide excellent back-up to the knight which will play to c4. This square will be seen to be very important for Black. If White tries b3 to eject the knight he will have a hole at a3 and a backward pawn at a2. However White will probably not be able to stand the knight for long and will play _xc4. Then Black gets rid of his doubled pawn and can make a general pawn advance on the Q-side. Did Capablanca examine the position further, and is it necessary to do this? Hardly. His experience and intuition will have suggested to him that victory is to be forced in such situations by further measures such as play on both sides of the board so as to stretch the defender's resources, but the details of these further measures have to be left till later, all depending on how the opponent reacts. What a fine position for Black! Black's sound position in the centre now lets him attack by the advance of the K-sidc pawns. 23 gacl c6 24 _&el gae8 25 g3 d7 26 fl g5! 28 gd3 f4 29 ef gf 30 <Nh4 Qh8

The reader might be sceptical about the value of this game, objecting that by simple moves White could have spoiled Black's whole concept. However chess is many-sided and at any point (except for cases of forced lines in a combination) the opponent can diverge, can choose from several different lines. What is important, however, is to form a correct plan arising from the demands, the features, of the position. If our plan is good then we can feel confident that any divergence will not be to our disadvantage. Had Janowski chosen either move that we indicated as better, there is no guarantee that we would not have had an equally instructive outcome but along other lines. 13 . . . Ad6 14 gfcl <R>e7

Admittedly White has a weakness at c4, but this is a traditional weakness in the Nimzoindian Defence and White has often been successful with this pawn formation. If White is playing to win he will have to work hard to find a point of entry in the black formation. There are two possibilities-along the g-file, or via the transfer point h5. But it is not clear where the knight should go to from h5, or how the bishop and queen will be employed. VX ithout looking too far ahead White formed this multi-stage plan.
1. Exchange a pair of rooks to help ease operations on the K-side.
White has taken the g-file and so carried out all three stages of his plan. What next? White has to find a way of penetrating deeper, and formed this plan.
1. Free the knight from the defence of c4 by playing the king to d3.
2. Then play the knight back to h5. Then with the rook on g7 there
would be the grave threat of >g6 winning the pawn on 16.

I was not put out by the pitying glances from my fellow team mates. My only concern was to find a win, otherwise I would have been labouring for days in vain. The new plan to win was:-
1. Play the queen to h8 to limit the mobility of the enemy pieces as much
as possible.
2. By a5, to open lines on the Q;side even at the cost of a pawn.
3. Combining threats by the queen on the h-file and on the queen side,
White will finally force the bishop to quit c8 and then the while king will enter via h5. Here is the conclusion of this epic game which is so instructive from the point of view of planning.

As for the sceptical reader who doubts whether such detailed planning was feasible, I must remind him that the game was adjourned several times and I had perfect freedom to examine all this at leisure, though I feel the planning would not be too much to expect at the board too. As we stressed at the outset, a plan for a whole game is very rare. It can happen in one of two cases; either when the opponent fails to put up much resistance and all the play is 'at one end'; and when certain factors give a fixed form to the position that cannot be changed in the normal course of play. queens. 14 . . . gab8 15 £}d5 -Nxd2 16 gxd2 b4 Forced in view of the threatened 17 cb ab 18 d4! with advantageous complications in the centre. 17 d4 Karpov considers this position strategically won for White, pointing to his grip on d5.

Reshevsky Petrosian, Candidates T. Zurich, 1953 Black has a difficult position. White's centre pawns look ready to advance and sweep everything from their path, supported as they are by well posted pieces. Black's pieces are cramped on the back three rows. His main strength lies in the Q-side pawns. For the moment the enemy centre pawns have a black square orientation which suggests that it would be well to blockade them by a knight on d5. But this post cannot be reached since the square e7 is occupied by a rook. Well then, give up the rook so that the knight can reach d5 and be supported by a pawn at e6.

some advice and warn the reader against typical mistakes in planning. The first piece of advice is, 'Don't lose contact with the actual position!' As we shall see, even strong grandmasters can go badly wrong in this respect. Your plan must be subordinated to the demands of the position, must arise from it. When you are looking for the best move you take into account many factors:-does it correspond to your aim, will it produce any drawback in your position, will the opponent be able to exploit the weak side of it? Only when you feel confident that you have weighed all these factors will you actually make the move. In particular you have to take account of the fact that every plan produces a change in the position of the pieces and pawns, so you have to consider the fresh position arising after the plan has been carried out. Does this new position offer chances to the opponent that he did not have before? The next example (83) shows a faulty plan. So Szabo planned to undermine the support of the knight by '"iya2 and Ab3 with pressure on the a2 /g8 diagonal. Then double rooks on the c-file after which there is a threat of -a5xb7, and if 'S'd7xb7 then gxc6and the strong point at d5 falls, and with it the whole enemy K-side is in danger. Unfortunately, though this plan seemed sound -the knight sacrifice for two pawns would only be made when all preparations had been completed-there is a flaw. The white pieces leave the king unprotected and Black can storm that side. If Szabo had weighed this up he would probably have chosen another plan. The idea of undermining d5 is right, but was carried out wrongly. There were much better chances in a pawn advance by gbl, a4 and b5 striving to create a weak pawn on c6 and then operating on both the b- and c-files. 1 #a2 a6

Szabo Botvinnik, Amsterdam Olympiad, 1954 White has to take account of the weaknesses in Black's position, most of all the square c5 and the weakened K-side. The half-open c-file on which White has already begun operations also has significance. There is the possibility of Black's K-side pawns becoming active. Considering the position of the pieces, one concludes that both sides have positioned them well, especially the knight at d5 which has influence on both sides of the board. White came to the conclusion that the position was about level and then considered his plan. The plan involving f3 was soon rejected-don't make pawn moves in the area where you are weaker. It is more logical to play on the Q-side. It would be nice to get rid of the knight at d5, but how? It would not be advantageous to give up the good bishop at e2.

study of the play of the grandmasters of the past. When you examine these games you notice that many plans repeat themselves, and you will naturally hope to apply these recurring plans in your own games. The study of typical plans is something that the leading grandmasters devote a great deal of time to. I would say that the most far-seeing of them devote as much time to this as to the study of openings. Lasker Capablanca, Moscow, 1935 28 hg hg

Botvinnik-Ragozin, Training game, 1947 The weakness of the black squares on the Black king side in diagram 84 is immediately apparent. Black's possesion of the d- and c-files is no compensation in view of the fact that White's active pieces do not let him use these files. White's plan is simple. He will increase the pressure on the weakened black squares aiming for a bishop sacrifice on g6 so that his queen and rooks can get a mating attack. There are also knights on the board, but they will soon be exchanged since White's knight will be too strongly posted at lb. When you follow how precisely Botvinnik carries out the plan of exploiting the black squares, you are full of praise, but . . .

Just as in the opening variations there is sometimes a move which can radically alter the assessment, so too there may be improvements in middlegame plans.

White's previous move revealed the outline of subsequent play. Spassky's plan has been tried many times before.

where we reckon wc shall have reached our objective. In other words the plan starts with our laying down our objective and ends with its achievement. In which cases should we aim for a one-stage plait, in which many- staged? It all depends on the concrete position we are dealing with, on the aim which we set ourselves. If the aim can be achieved in a few' moves, if it is achieved without a number of steps then our plan is of the one-stage sort. If the distance to the aim consists of many moves, if we need several 'jumps' to reach it then it is a question of a many-staged plan with intermediate, subsidiary aims. In whose clock time does the grandmaster think out his plan? As we have stressed already, everything that is expressed in words rather than variations should be thought out when the opponent's clock is ticking, as far as is possible. How does the idea of a plan arise in the mind of a grandmaster? The process is a creative one, but it is inextricably linked with the assessment. One of the tasks of the assessment is to establish where the weak points lie in each camp, and the plan must be linked with these weaknesses. Do not forget to devote some time to considering what plan the opponent has formed, or will form. The example of the Szabo-Botvinnik game showed us the consequences of ignoring the opponent. Moreover, know your own capacity and do not try to overburden your mind with plans you cannot cope with. There arc some players who, tojudge by what they say after a game, arc bubbling over with all sorts of ideas and plans. When you look into them you End that many of these ideas are not linked with the position, are superficial, unreal. You have to have realistic aims that you can cope with and that you can fit into a plausible plan. Work hard at your planning, and always bear in mind Lasker's aphorism, 'To find the right plan is just as hard as looking for its sound justification.' This stresses what cannot be repeated too often, that assessment and planning are inextricably linked. How to Train Once again we divide this into two parts. Training at home, and training during a game. For home training, the best thing is the study of well-annotated games. Once again we have to say that although there are many books on chess, there are few with the sort of thing the student needs. The modern grandmaster prefers to restrict himself to variations on the whole, but the Exercises 119 student should look for games with verbal statements as well as variations. If such 'prose' is missing, don't despair, but try and find out on the basis of just the moves at what point the assessment and planning took place. The effort to work this out will repay you. Training during a game should begin with simple plans. The most useful and necessary things are such as, which piece to exchange and which to leave on. This is a key question in many positions, and can form a plan in itself. Another basis can be the regrouping of pieces, or of just one piece. Achieving harmony in your position may be very necessary when it is not clear what else you should be undertaking. Always remember the value of analogies. The player who has 'collected' in his memory a number of sound plans will often find the opportunity to apply them, so easing the burden on himself: that is why the reader has been offered a large number of examples in this section. One final point. Be sure that you formulate your plan in words (of course to yourself in internal monologue-you will be able to share them with others later when you write notes or demonstrate the game). A schoolteacher of mine used this method to establish whether we knew the meaning of a word. If we could give a succinct definition then we knew the word. If we floundered about, we didn't know it. It is the same with plans. Consider that you have a plan only when you can formulate it in words in your mind. Otherwise there is no plan. Formulate a plan for realizing the extra pawn. State which positional factors help this plan. realizing White's material advan- tage.

They carry out quiet positional plans, and if they attack then they try to do it without sacrifices. However, this point of view is not quite correct. Even if our positional master does not carry out startling sacrifices, he has to be aware of combinational ideas and foresee short simple combinations if only to circumvent them on the part of the opponent. Elementary combinations are the basis of the whole chess struggle, and are the inevitable accompaniment of both strategical plans and tactical battles, such as one finds in pretty- well every game.

. . . ' 'e6 Black would win the a2 pawn for the exchange. Then by forming on the Q;sidc a second passed pawn and combining this with an attack on the weakened refuge of the king Black would have excellent winning chances.

If we leave on one side the excessive modesty of a player who had been world champion for ten years at that time, we must note that even a player of Botvinnik's strength had to take account of combinational vision and try to improve it. How does one improve in this respect? By analysing at home complicated positions. Just as a pianist practises the most com- plicated pieces to improve the technique of his fingers, so too a grandmaster must keep his vision in trim by daily analysis of positions with sharp possibilities, and this applies whether he prefers such positions in his play or not. So we conclude that whatever your inclinations you must have combinational vision and keep it in regular trim by practising analysis of positions which have sharp or forcing possibilities. If you don't do this you will regress. However there arc compensa-
3 Combinational Vision
Training Combinational Vision The audience at an international tournament is like a theatre audience. Their gaze is fixed on the stage, but not so much at the 'actors', as at the demonstration boards. The comparative quietness of the audience is normally disturbed only when a surprising move is played, say when a piece is placed en prise. Sometimes someofie will wave to the game demonstrators to indicate that he thinks they have put up the wrong move. But no! This time there is no error. The opponent replies, accepts the sacrifice, and a series of moves follow. Only then does the audience come to realize what is going on. A combination-has been played, a sacrifice made, and admiration is the order of the day. Why was the grandmaster confident he saw the future whereas the audience thought it a mistake? The simple answer is that the grandmaster has a well developed combinational vision, the audience is less well qualified. Is this a natural gift? Not really, otherwise the great players would have seen such combinations when they were very young. We know that child prodigies have played good chess, but rarely produced outstanding combinations. The marvellous productions of such combinational experts as Morphy, Alekhine and Tai came in their more mature period as a result of hard work and study. Of course a genius will master the subject better and quicker than one less well gifted, but we conclude that study and hard work will enable anyone interested in the subject to develop his eye for combinations. The question might be posed whether a player cannot get by without a thorough mastery of this art. After all there are grandmasters in whose play you will not find complicated combinations and sacrifices. Their games do not figure in the anthologies of brilliancies, they play without putting anything en prise, not minor pieces, not even Botvinnik commented on the position of diagram 98, 'Here White offered a draw, and after White's last move 16 dl-bS it was accepted - but wrongly!

I see this aim in scientific and creative achieve ments which put chess on a par with a number of other arts.' tions in this task. Great pleasure can be had in discovering combina- tions, or in working through the combinations of others. Some are real works of art which will give pleasure throughout the ages. We all know how worked up a player can get when going through such combinations. It is said that Alekhine sometimes got so excited with the position that hejumped up from the board and ran round it Kotov Holmov, Moscow Team Ch. 1972 Rossolimo-Reissman Puerto-Rico, 1967 White had only one move to save his bishop and stop the mate on cl. The triumph of inferior forces, of the little man, as in Charlie Chaplin films, is a powerful device favoured by drama writers. It also produces a strong effect on the chess fan. The dramatic effect of many combina- tions and studies is based on this. Who can fail to admire the follow- ing piece when he sees it for the first time? Black has his whole army intact, White has just one little pawn ( 102). cannot be taken -3 ... hxg6 4 gh3 mate, or, 3 ... fxg6 4 £}xg64- .

Chessboard Drama Combinations can entrance us by their surprising turns and dramatic content. Here we find one of the most surprising moves ever played (99). each one of the five captures leads to mate. The knights cannot take, nor the bishop because the rook at h2 is shut off and 3 . . . £jc2 mate follows. If the rook takes, the queen is shut off and there is mate by 3 . . . axb4. 3 -Nxd2 £V2+! 4 ' ,xc2 ab mate. A superb finish. Note that after 3 • xd2 the queen was blocking the defensive line of the rook at h2. The striking and unexpected nature of some combinative blows produces entrancing impressions. One cannot but be delighted by the next finish, although the idea had already occurred in games by Marshall and Alekhine ( 100).

132 Combinational Vision The Theory oj Combinations 133
to include many fine combinations in which there were no sacrifices, but it is a handy definition for the purpose of instruction. In order to clarify the constituent parts of a combination and what they consist of, it is best to examine a simple concrete example ( 124). combination is very limited. The presence of such circumstances is the reason for the genesis of the idea in the master's brain'. The next vital element of a combination is the final position which we are striving to reach. This position is called the theme of the combination. In our example, the theme position was the position when the king was mated and the name smothered matt* is the name of this particular theme. In order to reach the final position from the initial one. we have to make a series of moves which carry out the desired transformation. This series of moves that turn the initial position into the thematic one are called the means of the combination. In our example the means are the check on 17, the double check on h6, the queen sacrifice on g8 and finally the mating move to f7. One important further condition has to be mentioned. In addition to the main features or reasons making a combination feasible, there are always subsidiary features. In our example the combination would not have existed if the queen was not at c4 (or e6) since Black could then meet £}f7+ by taking the knight, and would be twro pawns up. These subsidiary features have always to be taken into account w'hen seeking a combination. They can be appropriately named the particular features of the position. 42)g4+ and so on from the start. The conclusion for the reader to draw from these fine examples is that chess combinations are a sort of dramatic work of art, full of tension and aesthetic content. It is for this facet of the game more than any other that millions of people throughout the world love chess. Now that we have seen the romanticism of combinations we £}b8+ b5 8 Na7+ Nb4 9 4>6+ <Nc3 10 £}b5+ <Nd3 11 £}b4+ Ne2 12 Nc3+ <£12 13 Nd3+ <Ng3 14 Ne4+ <Ng4 15 4>5+ <£15 16 £jg3+ £16 17 can settle down to their mechanism, and try to develop our eye for combinations by trying the exercises. A love for this is necessary- in order to improve. The Theory of Combinations It is useful to master some concepts of the constituent parts of combinations. After a great deal of discussion in Soviet chess literature about the correct definition of a combination, it was decided that from the point of view of a methodical approach it was best to settle on this definition:-A combination is a forced variation with a sacrifice. This definition fits in well with earlier ideas. Thus Lasker wrote that 'By positional play a master tries to prove and exploit true values, whereas by combinations he seeks to refute false values ... A combination produces an un- expected re-assessment of values.' Clearly what he has in mind here is the sacrifice which leads to the White delivers the well-known smothered mate by the following forced variation involving a sacrifice. 1 £jf7+ Ng8 2 Nh6++ Nh8 3 ' g8+ H x g8 4 4 17 mate. First of all what features of the position made the combination possible? The presence of two pawns blocking flight squares, the lack of space for the king that gives the mate its name. Such factors are called in chess theory the motif of the com- bination, the reason for it arising, the special features which enable the sacrifice to be made s6 that a specified aim can be achieved. As Lasker put it, 'The range of circumstances in which it is possible to presuppose the presence of a triumph in given circumstances of lesser forces over greater. Or take this quotation from Botvinnik, 'What is the essence of a combination? From his first steps a player is taught the normal materia] values of the pieces. It is known that a rook is stronger than a knight, that a bishop is about equal to three pawns, and a bishop and two pawns is about worth a rook, and a queen is stronger than a rook and so on. However there are positions where these relationships cease to apply, where, for example, a queen turns out to be weaker than a pawn. The path to such positions lies through the sacrifice'. I must point out that the defi- nition which we have adopted fails

The Basic Themes All possible combinations can be divided into three basic types, which can be further sub-divided as follows:- 11' Mating Combinations
1. Smothered mate
2. The 7 th and 8th ranks
3. Verticals and diagonals.
4. Attack on weak points.
5. Drawing out the king.

Let us go through these sub- headings with one or two examples of each type. Smothered mate We have already seen one example of smothered mate, in its purest form, though there are other ways in which the defending king is forced by the attacker to surround himself by self-blocking units (125). White has given up a piece for the attack, the defender's knights are far away from the king. 34 17+ Qh8 35 gdl #c8

The Double Attack The double attack or fork is learned by the beginner quite early on. It is based on some geometrical motif linking certain pieces which lets them be attacked simultaneously so that at least one of them must fall. Such combinations are very common, since the fork can be carried out by every unit from pawm to king (138). 1 c5+! Forking king and bishop. If 1 . . .

Diversion If often happens that a piece is firmly posted on a square where it blocks our approach to the king or hinders the execution of our intentions. Then it may be worth a great deal of material to divert it from its post ( 144): Kotov-Kalmanok, Tula, 1931 This is a possibility in the game which did not actually occur. 1 #g7 gf8 2 gxd5 ed 3 4W Axfb 4 4dg6+ Ae7 5 #xf8 mate. Always bear in mind that a pin is not necessarily a permanent feature: there may also arise some possibility of forcibly breaking a pin by a combinative stroke. Line Closing This feature occurs frequently, and is sometimes banal, but here is a spectacular example ( 142):- White has a clear win, and such Johansson-Rey, Postal, 1935 42) x e4! 42)cxe4 gxe4 £}xe4 gxe4 #xe4 Ng5!

Now the attacked queen must move while defending against the smothered mate at 17. 4 . . . #g6 5 #xh7+! #xh7 6 42)17 mate. When a king is stuck in the centre, the action of rooks and bishops can lead to decisive pins (141). This position (143) saw an equally fantastic move. Black's pieces are ready to deal with any discovered check from the rook at h3 by blocking with Rh6, or capturing the checking rook. 1 #e6!!

ambush, a frequently recurring feature, though the term itself is more frequently used in chess composition: it is defined in the
1964 Soviet 'Chess Dictionary' as
the positioning of a long ranging piece behind its own or an enemy piece, whose movement opens up the action of the ambushing piece on to a certain square or along a certain line. Here is another illustration ( 148): Overloading There are positions in which everything looks safe, but where the experienced eye will spot that a defending piece has too many functions to carry out and so is overloaded ( 149). attract it to a square so that we can profit from it ( 145).

After all it's a question of a forced win, so time trouble won't matter too much. That is the way it went in the actual game*. What can we say about the method of finding the combination? White stated the motifs-the bad king position, the open files. Nor did he fail to notice the special features of the position -the bishop at e8 that made #d6 mate possible in some lines. The thematic position was quite unknown to White at the *Tr. Note. Although the author does not state it, the game is Kotov- Yudovich, USSR Ch. 1939 the idea for an episode or a whole scene in their plays strikes them as a sudden flash of inspiration which can come to them in the most unexpected places, at the most unexpected time. Something similar can happen to a grandmaster at the board, but it is not an accident, it has been prepared by the play leading up to that particular position. Even many moves before the actual combination arises he may have had a feeling, or even the certainty that a combination is latent. This thought is suggested by certain motifs in the position. For example if he sees a weakened long black diagonal, he will feel that it would be nice to find a way of exploiting this. Or if the opponent fails to make a bolt hole for his king, there will arise the desire to achieve a back rank mate. One might say that the appear- ance of combinative motifs in a position provokes an urge in the player to seek a forcing line, a mood to play combinatively. The mood may change if the position becomes simplified, but in tense situations this mood is present to the maxi- mum extent. In the majority of cases his search for combinations, even in sharp positions, is not crowned with success-the position turns out not to be 'ripe' for such a solution, but suddenly, in the appropriate circumstances, the player is rewarded for his unremit- ting effort by the 'explosion' of a brilliant combination. Using the terms we have pre- viously defined, we might say that by going through the motifs of a given position we choose a corres- ponding thematic position for them. Or, on the other hand, knowing that a certain theme is possible, say back row mate, we seek the appropriate means, the measures required to reach the desired goal. Through Means to the Theme In many cases, probably the majority of them, a combination arises in the mind in the process of going through various plausible lines of play. When we start the calculations, we do not know the sort of thematic position we are aiming for; it arises in our mind after careful study of the available motifs followed by examining various ways of playing, one of which becomes the means of our combination. Let us imagine White's train of thought in diagram 150. We work on the assumption that he has come fresh to the position and so has to work it all out from the start, though in actual fact he has been sitting at the board for about three hours and his mind is already filled with the possibilities before him. He would be working it out along these lines:-What do I have? His king is badly placed, but I still have files, a strong knight at d4. Must hurry before he can slip away with the king to safety at b8. His last move was rook to e4 attacking the knight. Defend it by 12? He'll go Rd8. No, then I go ' '16+ winning. So he'll go g5 or • 'e5 centraliz- ing, and then what do I have? Wait a minute. What about 15+ ? He has no choice, takes and I go Rxf5. Then he can't take rook-mate on d6 by the queen. But he doesn't have to take. What do I have after ' c6 or c7? A piece gone. What about R15 instead? Well we are playing for mate, so a rook down wouldn't matter if it's sound. If his queen moves then g54- with a powerful attack. Nor can he meet the rook sac by e5, since

to take the rook and I take on 15 with knight, check. Then his king is drawn forward. But what if he doesn't take? Say

he would be in a bad way with the pawn going to e7 at once, or after 30 . . . @-e8 31 @'c7+ <5>g8 32 Ae7 4yg4 33 @'d7 and Black can resign. Or 30 Ba3 xaS 31 Nh5+ and now refusal by 31 ... <3?h6. Then 32 45x16 @rcl + 33 <g>12 @'d2+ 34 < ?g3 xcST 35 <|?h4 @, xd4+ 36 45g4+! All clear! Here again it was a case of having clearly expressed motifs. White then examined the means and came to the thematic position of the whole combination, which is promoting the pawn on e8. The number of thematic positions in chess is practically unlimited. That is why the mating position cannot be foreseen in most cases from the starting point, and becomes clearer only after the motifs and means have been worked through. calculations, but at the end. The most refined chess genius could hardly hope to tackle it in the reverse order. White has a strong attack, but how to mate? 1 Hg3 should win but a forcing solution is more desirable. What are the motifs? The badly defended king, and as more specific features the concealed battery @ 6 / ffi d3. and the pressure on the g-file. So we have to work through the means. 1 gg3 and 1 45g3 are not forcing enough, but suddenly the idea of the attack on h7 leads to the inspired thought that 1 @"h7+ may work. (Possibly for a combinative player such as Tai this queen sacrifice followed by double check would be the first idea to consider). After 1 ... < xh7 (Forced, otherwise 2 hS mate) the battery opens fire by 2 4516+ . If 2 ... <3?xh6 3 Sh3+ we find to our creative delight that it is mate in every variation, 3 ... <3Pg5 4 Hg3+ and 5 Hg6 or 5 Hg4 to follow. Then we seek other thematic positions of mate if 2 . . . 'S'hS. By hard effort we find these too, though our previous examination of variations and discovery of thematic positions helps us in the search. Thus 2 . . . <3?h8 3 J xg7+ ! <3?xg7 (or 3 ... Qxg7 4 £Nh3+ and mate next move) 4 Hg3+ and once again there are four squares to go to, but in each case the start, yet there were several such positions-every mating position that arose. Thus White went through the means of the combination (or more accurately speaking he sought continuations that became the means) and saw that he could draw out the king into his own position and there give mate, so there were various thematic positions according to the way Black chose. This was a typical example of finding a combination by the sequence motif -means-theme. Here is another example of the same pattern ( 151). motifs? Mainly the passed pawn at e6. Two moves forward and queens. Also my strong queen at e5, the distance of the knight at b3 from the scene of action. Removing the blockading queen would be desirable. The only way is J a3. What other use for the bishop which is otherwise dominated by the knight? Possibly 30 45h5+ gh 31 g5+ <3?f8 and only then
32 Aa3.
In any event the sacrifices at a3 and h5 clearly figure as possibilities. After ' 'g5+ where would the king go? Makes no difference, since after '@, xf6+ the king must go to g8- <3?e8 allows mate in two by '@'17+
[diagram]
'@'17+ and e7 or e7 at once. Clearly we get a new queen and the whole question is whether Black has perpetual check in the interim. So 30 .a3 'g'xaS 31 Nh5+ gh 32 @rg5+ SlphS 33 xlbT <5 8 34 c7.

What Engels Consultants, Ribeirato Preto, 1949 In diagram 152 we get various fine mating positions, but they are not the starting point of White's
148 Combinational Vision The Mind of a Grandmaster 149
vindictive rook gives mate on g6 or g8. If we work it out we will find that there were nine (!) different thematic positions in this com- bination, Such an abundance could not be coped with unless we started with motifs and means. So 2 a4 fails. What else? 2 c4 is a fine move now attacking the loose queen and closing the line of attack to the rook at e2. Fits in with the plan of diverting the defenders of Q>e8. So 2 . . . d7 is forced. Does that save him? Well, if we can go to c4 with impunity with the queen why not c7 too? Then the same considerations apply and he is forced to b5 again with his queen. We rest a moment and then take up the search again. His queen is at b5, mine at c7. Is 4 xb7 a diversion of the queen? No, he has that 4 . . .
[diagram]
with that rook at e2? If his queen was on a4 we would have 4 Re4! threatening 5 - xc8 and then 6 Rxa4 with a rook up. But we can get the queen to go to a4 by 4 a4! His ' 'Xe2 doesn't work any more-our queen blocks his rook on the c-filc. So 4 . . . xa4 5 ge4 and now back again 5 . . . b5. Now' he isn't threatening ' 'xe2, so we can go 6 ' 'xb7 and finally his queen has no squares from which to guard e8. Check it again. 1 g4 b5 2 c4 ' d7 3 c7 bS 4 a4 ' , xa4 5 gc4 #b5 (Any alternatives? 5 . . . 'S'fB 6 • xd6+ Be7 7 gxe7, or 5 ... g6 6 xc8 xe4 7 ' , xe8+) 6 • xb7. Hooray! This is the process then, by which the mind of a player, step by step, sees a combination, though at first he can only suspect that there is a e8 and d8. Here it isn't the case, given the bishop on d8 and the rook on b8. Then we get the idea of 1 d7 at once, but it fails to 1 . . . 4d*d7 or 1 . . . <3?f8. However the idea of pawn promotion still persists. Then there comes the inspiration that d7 would work if it forked units on e8 and c8. So consider 1 c8 gxc8 2 ge8+ g xe8 3 d7. Wait though, can three enemy pieces not cope with one pawn? Black has 3 . . . 4dd6, but only a few seconds of dismay give way to delight when we continue with 4 dc = £}xc8 5 ab and finally promotion is forced. Here the order was motif- theme-means. We considered the advanced pawns and then recalled the theme of a pawn on the seventh rank threatening a knight on the eighth. So the theme here was clear to us and preceeded the means. (I trust the reader would not have been surprised if such means had not existed. We have already stressed that for a combination to exist we had to have certain special factors as well as the presence of motif, means and theme). Here is another example of the motif and theme becoming clear, with the difficulty lying in the search for the means to link the two (184). At this point, and possibly earlier than this, White must have had the feeling that a back row mate could be 'on'-all three pawns are in Through Theme to the Means Any grandmaster can quote examples in which the road to discovery of a combination was different. Adams -Torre, New' Orleans, 1920 place denying the king a flight square off the back rank, while two pieces attack e8 and two defend it. Clearly a tense position. White can afford to put his queen cn prise to the rook at c8 and to the queen at d7, as long as he does not do it along the a4/c8 diagonal. Where should White's attacked queen go to? Clearly g4 is possible; not c4 as there is no threat and Black would just make a boh hole or go 1 . . . Rxe2. So 1 g4 when Black cannot go 1 ... Rxe2 since he loses his queen and White's remaining rook is guarded. (Don't lose sight of the fact that White too has no flight square and so a potentially weak back rank). Neither black rook can guard the attacked queen, so 1 . . . 'b5 is forced. How then to keep the pressure on. 2 a4 looks fine, but wait, what about 2 . . . • 'Xe2! and you are the one to be mated (3 •Nxc8 is met by the intermediate move 3 . . . xel + ). Good thing that was spotted in time! Ifwccome 'cold' to diagram 153 we would quickly sec its special features. If we had played for hours to reach it in an actual game, the motifs would be engraved in our mind. They are the open files and the presence of two advanced pawns. As a result the thought must arise, is it possible to promote one of them? Remembering standard patterns, you consider 1 ge8+ Nxe8 2 d7 when often the pawn queens be- cause of a double threat to queen on

beautiful possibility in front of him. Sometimes the suspicion cannot be turned into reality as the special features do not 'co-operate'. However fixing on a thematic position, studying the motifs, it is sometimes possible for the player to find the means to link the two. The creative thought of a player on the path motif-theme-means enables him to finally see the whole course of this magical process. The grandmaster in his creative search can be compared to a weary traveller in the forest who is looking for the hut where he will find warmth, comfort and rest. How should he find it? In one case he does not even know if there is such a hut, though his intuition and experience of life tell him that there could be. He tries this path and that. He may find it in the tangle of paths, or his search may finally prove to be in vain. Nevertheless he must seek it high and low! Then there is the case where the traveller knows for sure that there is a hut. He has been in this place before and seen it. This time there are no paths, and he must fight his way through marsh, fallen trees and other obstacles. Yet there must be a path to the desired goal! The position of diagram 155 looks fairly level. If Black can get in h6 then he will soon follow up with the freeing move c5. However the presence of the knight at g5 and the absence of a pawn at 17 always suggests a check on the a2/g8 diagonal. How can this diagonal be opened? Consider 19 d5!. If 19 . . . £}e7 (as was played in the actual game) then 20 de Axe6 21 gdl e5 [21 . . . 45d5? 22 Nxe6 xe6 23 c4 and the pinned knight will be lost) 22 A x b7 and the extra pawn will win. (Back row mate!) The combination comes after 19 ... ed 20 Axd5+! xd5 21 gd 1! and the queen has nowhere to go on the diagonal to prevent 22 •a2+, or 22 b3+ . So the motif was present, and the means were found. However, we must stress that the means depend on a combination of circumstances. It needed only a small change in the position for the combination not to work. Let us imagine that White had an extra pawn at b3. Then Black would have been able to play 21 . . . bS and after 22 a4 'bf would still prevent c4+ . Assessing the position of diagram 156 by the method which he had recently formulated, Steinitz would look for small advantages in White's position. Black has weak points at e6 and g7. White has possession of the c- and c-files, though not total control of them. Stcinitz-von Bardeleben, Hastings, 1895 Black is a pawn up which is in the centre, but the king is subject to attack. The overall assessment gives White the advantage, so he has the obligation to attack upon pain of losing his advantage. In Steinitz's days the theory of middle game play was not so far advanced as now, and Steinitz would not use the words motif, means and theme. From our point of view the bad position of the black king is an important motif for the following combination, which involves play on the back two ranks. Consider 20 #g4 g6 21 £sg5+ <R48. The presence of forced moves -and the tension in the position suggest a combination. Try 22 gxe7+. Then capture by the queen allows 23 H xc8+ . Or 22 . . . <Rxc7 23 gel + with a powerful attack. Thus 23 . . . R418? 24 <£}e6+ and wins the queen by 25 £y5+. Or 23 . . . <Rd6 24 W+ <R>c7 (24 . . . Sc5 25 Se6+) 25 Learn from the World Champions Once again we call upon the help of the world champions, and hope to develop our combinational vision by working through the thought processes behind their best efforts in this field. Our helpers will work through the variations without moving the pieces on the board, and you must try to do the same. This method, which most closely approaches the conditions of competitive play, cannot be recommended too strongly. You should seize every opportunity to solve puzzles, studies, and 'find the continuation' quizzes in newspapers and magazines. Here we will work through themes in the order in which we have already considered them. Our supposition about the way the champions discovered and worked through their combinations is based on their notes, and partly on the author's knowledge of the men and their methods.

Three moves is too long since it would let Black organize a defence, and my own king is not too safe. I must strike at his weakest point. He has a good defence built up on f7 and h7. The knight sacrifice on g7 looks right. Then I follow up £}f5+ and the bishop attacks from h6 or IB. That looks logical. (Of course Smyslov in his whole build-up would have seen that he was angling for a knight sacrifice on g7, but we are working on the basis that he has come 'cold' to the position, as the reader had done).

What does one do in such a case? Never mind, just keep on playing! Perhaps later in the game the combination may prove feasible. Even if not, there is no reason to despair.

Larsen-Spassky, USSR-Rest of World, Belgrade, 1970 In diagram 163, White has just attacked the knight. Should I retreat? Then he would complete his Q-side development. I can sacrifice the knight by 12 ... h4 and after he takes my knight I get a powerful pawn on g3. Nearly all my pieces can back it up, while he has a set of undeveloped pieces on the other side. Moreover his queen is a long way away and cannot get over to the K-side in time. Plenty of motifs here. The pawn at g3 can go forward to promote by g2 and Shi. So here we have a thematic position arising very soon, before the means are clear. Black en- visages queening the pawn on g3, though he cannot yet see whether he will achieve this.

Need I be looking to take his rook? 3 . . . < xf2 removes the threat to my rook, and threatens 4 . . . £}xhl and if 5 xhl with check. So he will go 4 Qjr2. and the position loses some of its tension. How can Black win? Just a pawn up w'ith such a relation of forces would not win an endgame. He could give up a knight for a pawn with a theoretical draw. Something forced has to be looked for instead. Clearly I must attack and 4 . . . e6 fits the bill.

He will play 5 gc2 attacking both knights. Then there must either be a forced win, or I will have to play the long boring endgame with two pawns against one on the K-side with only minimal winning chances.

The Calculation of Variations The ability to calculate variations rapidly and accurately is the third of the basic attributes of a chess master: lapses in this respect can cancel out in a moment the efforts of hours. That is why you may come across top class practitioners who do not assess positions well enough, or are not dab hands at combinations, but you will never come across one who calculates variations badly. This topic is dealt with thoroughly in the book 'Think like a Grandmaster', so here we restrict ourselves to a summary of the main points and then develop the theme with examples from the leading grandmasters. The first important point is the order in which we think of moves. When we are setting out to calculate various variations from a given position, we must first establish clearly in our minds all the possible candidate moves in this position. If we fail to do this and get engrossed in one line of play, we may quite fail to see what might be the main line. Once we have established all the candidate moves, we then proceed to work out the variations arising from them one by one. The question of what order to tackle them in is a matter of taste. Some players like to look at the hardest lines first and only then dispose of the easy ones. Others prefer to do it the other way round. All possible variations may be depicted in the form of a tree of analysis in which the variations and sub-variations are represented by the branches and boughs of the tree. The main thing to master is the rule that during a game you must go along each branch once ind once only. No going back, no repeating yourself! Wandering to and fro through the branches of the tree leads to loss of time and that scourge of practical playcrs-time trouble. To achieve such self-control takes great effort, but the results are well

worth it. Learn to trust your brain. It is only in very exceptional positions that a grandmaster will check and re-check the same line, and this when it is particularly complicated. As a rule he does not wander aimlessly through the branches. Then we must recall the important piece of advice that we call Blumenfeld's Rule. It often happens that a player carries out a deep and complicated calculation, but fails to spot something elementary right at the first move. In order to avoid such gross blunders, the Soviet master B. Blumenfeld made this recommendation:- When you have finished your calculations, write down the move you have decided on on the score sheet. Then examine the position for a short time 'through the eyes of a patzer.' Ask whether you have left mate in one on, or left a piece or a pawn to be taken. Only when you have convinced yourself that there is no immediate catastrophe for you should you make the planned move. There are various sorts of the tree of analysis according to the nature of the position we are dealing with. Here are some examples: (see the drawing) Capello-Kotov, Malta, 1976 Just as Black had to do the move before, White here ( 183) has to work through the variations to answer the question, can White take on fb? The first moves are clear: 1 g xfb <g>xfb 2 xe8 be 3 48+ . Now there are two candidate moves 3 . . . g5 and 3 . . . 17 which we examine in turn. I. 3 . . . Qg5 4 h4+.

do this they have to learn to discipline their thoughts, and develop the right w ay of thinking about variations. A great help in economizing on time is the right choice of opening and a knowledge of all the possible finesses in the line. If you can play the first ten to fifteen moves in just as many minutes, you can be in a state of bliss for the rest of the game. If, on the other hand, Bronstein thinks for forty minutes about his first move, then time trouble is inevitable. There is an opinion that practice in lightning games can help. Obviously if you are practised in blitz play you may find it easier to find the right decision in a time scramble, but this is not an invariable rule. Some specialists at blitz lose their way in a scramble, and on the other hand some poor lightning players cope well in time trouble. The best example is Botvinnik, who never liked playing fast games, but always managed well when short of time. So prepare well for the opening, and having saved time in that way do not lose it back again by wandering to and fro along the branches of the tree of analysis. That is the way to get out of the painful clutches of the clock. Reference to time trouble as a justification for mistakes has long been condemned by the best players. In his notes to his game with Tylor at Nottingham 1936 Alekhine wrote about one of his moves, 'A horrible mistake, and the fact that White was in severe time pressure, in my opinion, is as little justification for it as the claim by a law-breaker that he was drunk at the time of the offence. The inability of an experienced master to cope with his clock must be regarded as just as serious a fault as an oversight'. Calmness-the Paramount Consideration The reader is entitled to advice on how to play in time trouble. What is it that guarantees success at such a point? First and foremost, be self- possessed and keep calm. If you can remain cold-blooded and do not make any impulsive gestures, if you can restrain your clenched fingers from reaching out to the pieces, you will greatly improve your chances. When I was a young man I was a games demonstrator at the 1936 Moscow International tournament. The game between Flohr and Capablanca made a deep impression on me. The former world champion played inaccurately in the opening, lost the exchange for a pawn, and then blundered away the pawn as well. By move thirty his position was critical (199). Time Trouble The two players sit down to play a game in a competition in a good mood, full of hope for the outcome, calm and confident. However the clocks tick away and moods change. One player becomes inspired by chances of victory, the other sits there under the threat of defeat. Now there is no question of their former equality and sense of well-being. The change in atmosphere is noticeable in the state of the players, the position on the board and the state of the clocks. As a rule the player who stands worse is also worse off for time. Then we get the last hour of play when the evil genie of time trouble hangs like a fearful apparition over the game. This evil genie has ruined thousands of games and fine creative ideas, has decided the fate of top titles: who amongst us has managed to keep calm when the flag is lifted by the minute hand and yet there are still several moves to make? Time trouble pitilessly persecutes ordinary players and world championship contenders alike. Can it be cured, and if it can't, then how should you play with a hanging flag? The answers to these questions are of great practical importance. The thinkers and the swift reaction players The masters and grandmasters can be divided into three groups-the inveterate time trouble merchants, those who sometimes get into trouble, and those for whom the phenomenon is a very rare occurrence. It is no secret that, for example, Geller is often at odds with his clock, and this applies just as much to Bronstein, Reshevsky, and Browne. On the other hand many experienced players fear time trouble and try hard to avoid it. There are a few grandmasters who almost totally exclude it: in this regard Karpov comes to mind. His speed of thought is so great that often his opponent's flag falls when he himself, even in the toughest top games, has a great deal of time in hand. What is the reason for this? Obviously it is to be explained in terms of his natural ability, character, good nerves and most of all by the perfection of his 'thinking apparatus'. This apparatus has been so keyed up by much practice of analysis and play that it works perfectly under the most trying circumstances. How to avoid time trouble However even those who get into time trouble can get out of this habit. To
178 Calculation and Practical Play Time Trouble 179
At this point Flohr finally took a breather and offered a draw. His winning chances were long gone-the time trouble had played a nasty trick on him. It is curious that on Capablanca's score sheet all the moves were written down in calligraphic handwriting. Exploiting the opponent's time shortage It is well known that it is advisable to drum up complications if the opponent is short of time, since he will not be able to work it all out in time. This is especially worth trying if the opponent has a totally won game (200): Flohr -Capablanca, Moscow, 1936 It is not hard to see that White should win. He only had to play 30 gc7 for example and Black is hopelessly placed. However Flohr went 30 g4 which let Black complicate. 30 ... 31 hg <3?g6 32 gdl?

The players carried on moving even though the forty moves laid down in the time limit had been reached. The point was that Flohr had stopped writing the moves down since he was in bad time trouble, while Capablanca did not feel that he should stop the blitz play. What if his opponent who had already gone wrong should make another mistake? Reshevsky -Kotov, Candidates T. Zurich, 1953 Here I realized that my position was hopeless, but decided to play on his chronic time shortage. Reshevsky had already played a number of moves at blitz speed, and on each occasion had made ridiculous little jumps in his seat. This had exasperated me, and my next move is explained not only by my desire to exploit my last chance, but by my very nervous state. Unexpectedly I put my queen on e2. Ifhis rook goes to fl then I have 35 • • • gdl. Reshevsky realized this straight away and nearly lost his head. His flag was quivering, but by a great effort he found the right answer.

Well, all right, it hadn't worked, but it was a fine idea. I am firmly convinced that this was my only chance and I was obliged to take it! Do we have the right to exploit the opponent's time shortage in this way? I s it ethical to try and trick in some way or other a player who has lost his head and sometimes all self-control?

180 Calculation and Practical Play
'juridicial' point of view. At the start of the game each player is given 2| hours for 40 moves, on average 31 minutes a move. This 'treasure' must not be squandered. Then, on the other hand, there is no doubt that a player who plays quicker than the rate laid down runs some risk of making more mistakes than his deeper thinking opponent. So the player who has used his time to the full has tended to think the position out better. Why then should we 'take pity' on the opponent who has used his time well to make a big step forward towards beating us? By the logic of the struggle we not only have the right but also the obligation to make use of his time trouble and put the maximum difficulty in the way of his finding the best moves. The commonest misconception in such circumstances is to play quickly. Inexperienced players argue that if they take their time over moving, the opponent will use this time to work out all the variations and find the best answer. Such a policy of blitz play evens up the chances and can lead to gross blunders. The best way to exploit the opponent's time pressure is to . . . conduct the game as if there were no time pressure at all. Of course you cannot be unaffected by the situation to some extent, but you must try to sit calmly at the board and work out your moves just as if the game was only starting. This is the most unpleasant thing for the opponent who is under pressure himself, but sees that you are ignoring his time pressure. This must be discouraging for him. It is particularly important to maintain your imperturbability in positions where you stand better or in an even positional struggle. Here haste is out of the question. As I have indicated, there are cases where the attempt can be made to bamboozle, but this is only where you stand worse. If you can't see any good way to equalize then some form of unexpected shock move can be useful, even if it is unsound. This was the case with my
[diagram]
There is also the 'series of moves' technique used to baffle the opponent. You think out some unexpected line of play and spend a considerable amount of time on the process. The opponent is looking at the position during this period too, but it is hardly likely that he will work out as deeply as you can the consequences of this line. You after all have made up your mind to consider this alone, while he has to look at a range of other possibilities. Most likely many of the finer points of the line will escape his notice, since the introductory move is unexpected. Once you have worked out all the consequences you play your moves at lightning speed. In the given circumstances the chances of success arc high. Time Trouble 181 Cabalistic signs The competition player is forbidden the use of reference material and mechanisms which might help or speed up his calculations. The only thing at his disposal is the score sheet and the 'time-trouble types' mark this up with all sorts of cabalistic signs which in their opinion help them to get out of time trouble. I have seen many of these efforts on the sheets of my opponents and colleagues. The commonest is the 'mile-post sign'. After the 8th move they mark 30 m.; after the 16th 1 hr. and so on to the 40 with half an hour for each 8 moves. The intention is fine, but the implementation is pretty often poor. Such specialists in time trouble sit there using up their last quarter of an hour and they have only made twenty moves, sometimes less. Then again some people try to cope with just the last ten moves. They are reconciled to getting into time trouble, and mark up the sheet in the reverse order so that opposite move 40 is written 1, opposite 39 is 2, 38-3, and so on. Then they have the count down to zero as in the launching of cosmic rockets. They claim this gives them an instant sight of how many moves have still to be made, but not much good comes of it. Once time trouble arrives, any form of writing is forgotten in the rush to find a move and play it. Sometimes you will even see a player counting on his fingers. I have known players set up ten captured pieces by the side of the board and take one from the set after each time trouble move made. An unreliable method, and it is not clear whether the judge should permit such juggling. Should any of these methods be imitated? Certainly not! I feel they not only don't help, but can hinder. I repeat that the only way is good preparation, proper analysis of variations, confidence in yourself and calmness. This is the way to play logically and accurately, the only way to use your time properly. Anti Time Trouble Training A universal remedy cannot be proposed since the fault is the product of so many different factors, but a significant reduction can be achieved by certain prophylactic measures. Training in the calculation, of variations has already been mentioned. Try to find a complicated position which is unknown to you and has been analysed by a strong player. Put a clock by the board and allow yourself and 'the opponent' three or four minutes before the flag drops, I ry to play the position out working out the variations for eat'fi side. 1 hen compare the lines you found with the annotations. By gradually reducing the time
182 Calculation and Practical Play The Three Fishes in Action 183
allowed you will get some practice at playing complicated positions with a hanging flag. For particularly bad sufferers we can recommend play in special training events with the aim of avoiding time trouble. It Is important to learn how to control your thoughts so that you do not waste time, but make up your mind without excessive timidity or doubts. Botvinnik's Advice It is particularly useful to read Botvinnik's comments, 'I tried as far as possible to rid myself of time trouble. Generally speaking you cannot be wholly rid of it, and this would be unwise. During a game there are moments when you have to examine the position scrupulously, you have to spend 20-30 minutes thinking it out and then make the remaining moves to the control at a quicker rate. This is "normal" time trouble and I do not intend to avoid it. But it often happens that a player wastes valuable time at the board -he analyses variations which can be seen in advance as unsuitable, or he cannot drag himself away from a tempting but disadvantageous line. I have taught myself to use time economically, and reached a satisfactory solution to the problem sometimes even by reducing the standard of my play. There is no other way. How else can you accustom yourself not to waste time?!' Then he adds this valuable advice, 'I long ago advised our masters who systematically get into terrible time trouble of a way of combatting this fault . . . You have to play training games in which your attention is directed primarily at the clock and not the standard of play or the result, and then continue these exercises until you have worked up the habit of using your time properly, of managing to work out all the necessary variations. I think that 90% of sufferers from time trouble would be cured by this method, with the one exception, naturally, of those who are "incurably ill".' The Three Fishes in Action The self-improvement process in a player has some similarities to the learning process of a musician. At first the student has to learn the correct handling of his instrument, then various exercises improve his technique and the suppleness of his fingers. Parallel with this is the study of the classical heritage of the great musicians, all those pieces which the performer will ultimately have to play on stage. So too with the chess player. As he improves his positional under- standing, his eye for combinations, and his technique of calculation, the future master needs practice under the competitive conditions which will test his application of these techniques. All the rich variety of middlegame positions can be reduced to three main groups:- positions in which we have the right and duty to attack; positions in which we have to defend; and positions which are level, characterized by lengthy manoeuvres. In each group the application of the 'three fishes' is decisive. Attacking As Steinitz stressed, the player with the advantage must attack, choosing the opponent's weakest spot as his object of attack. Depending on the circumstances this weak spot may be the king position, the centre or the Q-side. We will examine first the attack on the king. This is the most effective form of attack which follows up the main aim of the game-to mate the enemy king. We consider three types in order:- the attack on the uncastled king, the attack when the kings are castled on opposite sides, and the attack when both kings arc castled on the same side. A lack of urgency or an opening mistake can lead to a failure to castle when such a measure was called for. Then the other side can start immediate play against the king or some other suitable object. In many- cases the result is a failure ever to reach safety with the monarch. Books on the Sicilian Defence in particular abound with examples of this sort. The attacker must spare no effort to exploit this situation. Here is one example (201). Kotov -Kalmanok, Tula, 1931

White takes immediate measures to stop this by threatening 11 , 'g7 and so forces Black to retreat a developed piece. disincentive to castling and to be ahead of the opponent in the wing pawn race. Remember that it takes several moves to get the pawns advanced so that line opening is inevitable, and we must therefore try to calculate the consequences as carefully as if in playing a combination, especially as such an advance normally means burning your bridges behind you. The speed and effectiveness of the line opening advance is greater when the defender has made some pawn advance on that side, or when our advance is made with gain of time by attacking enemy pieces en route. The position of our pieces must be considered, since a pawn storm cannot win on its own. Ifour pieces are far away some other method of play may be called for. All these considerations must be weighed before deciding on the pawn storm.

18 4}e5 45d7 Black now played 18 . . . c7, and lost quickly; if 18 . . . Qc8, we have reached a position examined earlier in the book as diagram 141. The main rule in playing against an uncastled king is that the attacker should initiate an immediate clash so as to prevent the defender develop- ing and getting the king into safety. Do not be frightened of sacrifices to open lines against the king, though work out the consequences care- fully. Opposite side castling is normally a sign of sharp play, since each side can then advance a pawn storm against the enemy king without weaken- ing the pawn cover of his own. An attack by pieces alone is a rare occurrence in such cases, and the following questions therefore naturally arise: - Who will get in first with the pawn advance, will one side be forced onto the defenisve so that his pawn advance will merely prove to be weakening? Of course this does not mean that a few defensive moves on your king's side may not prove advisable. It may prove advisable too to advance pawns against a potential castled position even before the enemy king has left the .centre, both to act as a Kotov-A. Polyak, Moscow v Ukraine, 1937 White argued that his pieces are better placed to get at the king once lines are opened than Black could, but recognised that his advance a3 made line opening easier for Black. However with a stable centre and well placed pieces, the plan of a storm seemed sound. The position offers about equal chances to both sides.

By far the most frequent case of attack on the king is when both sides have castled short. We have already seen examples of a piece attack in such cases e.g. Karpov-Polugayevsky (Diag. 48) Lasker Capablanca (Diag 85) and a number of others. The method used is to concentrate as much force as possible on that side of the board and use weak points there to force a way home. More complicated cases occur when a pawn storm is involved, or intuitive sacrifices are played. The advance of pawns in front of your own king to help in an attack is a risky business, which can only be justified if the centre is firmly closed and the opponent is not in a position to play some counter blow there.

There are positions, however, where such an intuitive sacrifice is the only way to victory. Some would argue, why take the risk and still settle for a draw rather than get involved in the complications. It all depends on one's character, and attitude to chess. Take an example from the greatest exponent of these sacrifices to see what entrancing complications can arise from such play (206). What can happen if mass pawn advances are made in front of the king with an unstable centre is clearly shown here, where White's position crumbles quickly ( 205) Vajda-Kotov, USSR -Hungary, 1949

As the reader has already seen the successful conduct of an attack often involves sacrifices, which as a rule are based on exact calculation, if not to the very end then at least to the point where it is clear that adequate compensation is achieved. However, there arc cases in actual play where sacrifices arc based on intuition rather than calculation, where the judgement and experience of the player tell him that the offer is worthwhile even though he cannot prove this. Such sacrifices are rare and there are players who never make them, who will only sacrifice if they can satisfy themselves that the offer is quite sound. *Tr. note.

<S>14 39 g3+ Qe3 40 gd3+ -&-xd3 41 xd3+ 1-0 Among the many questions which the mind of the master has to resolve is whether to play a sacrifice. There are cases where it is obvious that he shouldn't, or that he should, but chess like life has many facets and such an ideal case is pretty rare. How much time is taken up in considering those unclear situations where he is tormented by doubt! In those cases where analysis cannot answer the question, the player has to rely on intuition and experience; often he asks himself whether such a sacrifice has occurred before in similar situations. There is also the point that he may be able to reach his aim by quieter lines. The decision also depends on style and character. Some players are bold enough to go for a sacrifice even when calculation of the variations convinces them that it is dubious. Then there is the opposite situation where a player works out that the sacrifice would give him a good game, even a win, but does not play it since a quiet line is just as effective and does not involve so m-uch emotional upset. I remember a case where Capablanca worked out an impressive combination, but then chose to make a simple move in answer to which his opponent resigned at once! Karpov too is well known for his rational approach to the game. We have given one example (diagram 48) where the press room experts 'recommended' an exchange sacrifice, but he took a simpler line. Does this mean that he avoids sacrifices entirely? Not at all! When the offer of material is the quickest way to victory, he will sacrifice even if it is not entirely cut and dried and he has to rely partly on intuition. ir Karpov-Spassky, Candidates Match, 1974 Diagram 208 is a position from the decisive 1 1 th game of the match that took him to the final.

192 Calculation and Practical Play
indicate one way or the other. These include the character and style of the opponent, the situation of the tournament or match in which you are involved, the state of the clocks, and the possible effect on colleagues in a team match. A sacrifice may be more effective if played against a quiet player than one delighting in complications. You yourself may be one or the other. If you must go for a win, a sacrifice may well be indicated, but there are situations where a draw would suit you. Complications are best avoided in time trouble, unless you stand badly, of course if your opponent is badly short of time a sacrifice by you, even if not totally sound, has good chances of success. Particular factors are involved in team competitions. Here the game is not just your personal responsibility since the course of the game will be followed with concern by your team mates. In such cases the spirit of collectivism has to be considered. Let us assume that you have played a correct piece sacrifice. Only you know the fine points of your concept; to your colleagues it might seem that you have just lost material. Then they will start getting worried and this can affect the overall score. That is why, for example, in Soviet teams playing in the Chess Olympiads there is a strict though unwritten rule. You have to play in such a way that the rest of the team does not get concerned about your position. Even the greatest adherents of sacrificial play subordinate themselves to this consideration. A large number of games are decided by assuming the offensive in the centre or the Q-side: in such cases sacrifices are less common; both piece pressure and pawn storms are suitable devices. When pawns advance in such cases they do not necessarily open lines, but the advance may also free space for the pieces to manoeuvre in. The reader has already seen examples of various sorts of offensive in the centre, and on the Q-side; often pressure on the Q-side grows into an attack on the king. Such a transfer of the attack from one wing to the other occurs frequently in practice. The important strategic postulate behind such play on both wings is that the pressure on one wing alone can be defended against adequately by the opponent, especially when the active side has no entry points for his pieces. In this case it is important to initiate action on the other side of the board. This stretches the defender's resources in having to move his pieces this way and that, especially if he lacks manoueuvring space. At some point the defender will not regroup in time and so suffer loss. Many games have been played in accordance with this strategical idea. The Three Fishes in Action 193 Defending When a player gets an inferior position he is forced to defend, as indicated by Steinitz. The first essential is to realize the moment when your are required to adopt the defensive role and give up all ideas for the time being of winning. Many players recognize this too late, and start taking the necessary measures when it is already very hard to save matters. The author of this book, must, alas, be counted amongst this number-there vou are sitting back and taking it easy when the enemy is already at the gates'. This feeling for danger is a most valuable asset, part natural and part acquired by practice. Karpov and Petrosian have such a sense of danger to a high degree. To achieve such a sense demands not just general understanding of the game, but also strong will power and self-control. Once you have recognized that you are in some danger you must mobilize yourself to create the maximum difficulties for the opponent, put obstacles in his way and so hope to slow down the pace of his assault. It is at that point that you can start thinking of seizing the initiative again. Passive defence demanding calm nerves and sticking power. There is also the policy of exchanges, especially of our passive units for active enemy ones, with the long term aim of reaching an endgame that will be easier to draw. This is particularly the case with rook and pawn endings or opposite coloured bishop endings. Of course this pre-supposes that the defender has a high level of endgame technique and knows how to play these endings which have a marked tendency towards a drawn outcome. 'Attack is the best form of defence' is a slogan that applies in many spheres of activity, chess included. If you choose the exact moment to counter-attack, it can have great psychological effect, so we advise the reader to take plenty of time over his choice of when to play the appropriate counter blow. We must stress that preparing such a counter strike when under pressure is a difficult art, but the reader must try to master it. Counter attacking moves as a rule are very striking and enrich chess no less than the finest combinations. That is why players who have mastered this art have always been so highly thought of. Level Positions The position from which the game starts can be considered as fairly level. In the course of play one side often gets the better of it while the other side is forced to defend. However in many games the equilibrium is not disturbed and the players manouevre in accordance with Steinitz's precept, trying to
194 Calculation and Practical Play
upset the balance in their favour. If no mistakes or inaccuracies are made, then level positions keep on producing even chances for each side. However the same methods of applying the three factors of chess mastery apply, though the effects they produce may well be in more subdued tones than when one side is bending the other to his will. For the same reason, play in such positions tends to be more exacting than when the aim is clearer. To recognize the crucial moment when a chance is presented is not easy and the only guarantee against failure is the overall and move-by-move assessments which we mentioned in Part One. The Three Fishes in Action 195 White has achieved one of his aims, and Black should fight this blockade by b6, but he restricts himself to attempts to make use of the weakened b5 square. 24 . . . $d7

He will try at all costs to drive an enemy knight from d5 so as to cramp Black. Also he will try to block the Q-side by a4-a5. Finally the position of the pawns at h6 and g6 may enable White to weaken the K-side further by the advance of the h-pawn to h5.

The Opening 197 game as soon as possible, avoiding all risk of falling into some sharp prepared line. Look at many of the games of Smyslov and Bronstein to see that they never agree to set their foot on some path thoroughly worked out in modern analyses, but with which they are unfamiliar. The same applies to other veteran grandmasters.
3. The opening theoretician: Only a few current or previous grand-
masters deserve or deserved this title. Their names figure in series of opening works, in regular articles in chess magazines. They are dangerous opponents, especially if you fall into one of their pet lines. However there are also cases where someone has found a hole in their published analysis and used it against them so that one might say, 'Those who live by the sword shall perish by the sword.' It is hard to follow their example, there are only a chosen few who can devote themselves to such unremitting effort. However their knowledge can be regarded as an ideal in respect of a few openings that a player should specialize in. Follow their example ofdeep study in your favoured lines, not with the aim of perpetuating your name in chess history but so as to deepen your understanding and have the confidence to play this and other stages of the game into which there may well be a carry-over effect.
4. The world champions: Once again let us learn from their example.
Straight away one can say that there were no 'widely read' types among them, except perhaps Euwe, and towards the end of their careers they nearly all turned to an 'ideas' approach. But the world champions were great connoisseurs of the openings that they did play, produced a lot of fresh ideas in them, sometimes shattering their opponents with an unexpected discovery. What practical advice can be given, how should one proceed? The best answer seems to be, 'Learn a little dbout everything, and everything about one thing'. True, this is work enough for a lifetime, but it gives a guide to the problems posed by the expansion of knowledge and information. You should choose two or three openings which you intend playing regularly in your games, and study them deeply. At the same time try and have some knowledge of the other openings. It might come in useful and the ideas found there might be applicable to your basic arsenal. First of all consider the problem of playing with Black, which is always harder in view of the initiative which White enjoys in the early stages. Settle on one opening to adopt against 1 e4 and one against I d4. 1 he choice must depend on your tastes, character and experience. Then you have to decide whether you are basically going to be a 1 c4
196 Calculation and Practical Play
The Opening The exacting reader of this book whose aim is to know how to become a grandmaster may wonder at the amount of attention given to the middle game compared to the opening and endgame. Our answer is that in these phases of the game we get the same struggle of the pieces, of plans, tactical blows and combinations, though the first and last parts of a game do have their special features. However there are incomparably more books available on the endgame and opening than the middle game. As a result, understanding of the middle game has greatly lagged behind those phases of the game where memory and learning now play such a big part. We can discern four different attitudes to the opening depending on a player's tastes and character.
1. The wide reader: Talk to some young masters and they will
overwhelm you with reference to a mass of variations, complete with references to games, who played what and when, what the world champions said about it. This is not just a specialist in one opening, but a walking encyclopedia who knows nearly all openings, remembers all the variations in the specialist works of theory. Can he be called an expert in the openings? Strictly speaking, no. If you dig deeper, you find that he spouts out the variations without feeling the finesses of the position. Yet how much time goes on the study of these books and magazine articles! Such a player hardly has the time to study the basic theory of the middlegame and other aspects of chesk This approach cannot be recommended; it is sure to lead to impoverishment of your play. How often have I met such sorry experts. Out of their band has come not a single player of top class.
2. The 'ideas' man: He is the direct opposite of the wide reader. He bases
himself on a knowledge of the ideas of this or that opening, though he may not know concrete variations. He simply knows which piece to place where, which part of the front to give his attention to. This approach is the one that grandmasters tend to have towards the end of their careers, when they lack the effort or the stimulus of ambition to make them work through current analysis of openings that they may have been keenly interested in in their youth. So in opening the game, especially with an erudite opponent, such a player will play 1 <N13 2 g3 3 a g2 then fianchctto the other bishop and avoid any sharp opening fight. His argument is that he understands the position better than his opponent and it is in his interest to get to the middle The Endgame 199 side is tensed up, but suddenly we have mass exchanges and after the 'poetry' of sharp combinational struggle we get the 'prose' of the endgame. Since technique predominates in the ending, the player has to re-adjust his thoughts and his mood. There will be little scope now for brilliancy or tactics. If you can spare the time on the clock, it would pay to devote several minutes to calm down after the passion of the middle game, so that you will start examining the position in the correct way from the point of view of the endgame. The most general rule one can state about this phase of the game is that there is no need to hurry. In the opening or middle game we are conscious of the need to carry out our ideas with due despatch, not to lose a tempo and so on. If you examine the games of the best endgame players, Capablanca, Flohr, Smyslov, Karpov, you will be surprized at the number of repetitions, the slow measured progress they make. If a pawn can go h2-h4, say, the grandmaster will often take his time and play h3 first and h4 later. The reasons for this approach are:
1. Gaining time on the clock in view of the hourly control applying at
this stage.
2. The chance to sink deeper into the position, to make slight changes
and then assess what real difference they make.
3. Developing the right attitude of massive calm.
4. The psychological pressure exerted on the opponent, who is thus
convinced that he is in your power while you play cat and mouse with him. It is very hard to play well under such pressure, which often induces mistakes. In the ending, as a rule planning comes to take first place, and relegates the investigation of variations to second place-in some way a reversal of roles as compared to the middlegame. Schematic thinking comes first, as seen in the way Capablanca thought about this position (211) 19(j Calculation and Practical Play player, or a 1 d4 player. In either case there is much to be studied in view of the wide choice of replies by Black. I must admit that there is a risk ofbeing too limited in this approach, but the overall aim must be to keep your opening play in harmony with your play in the later parts of the game. To make considerable advances in your open- ing play without being able to follow this up in the rest of the game is pointless. Practical experience has shown that the more players get involved in studying theory from the many books available the more they run the risk of missing the elementary, of not seeing the wood for the trees. Even very strong players get so engrossed in a pet variation that they forget to check whether they are developing their pieces quickly and on the right squares, whether they are getting the king away from the dangers of an open centre. Of course every rule has its exceptions, and knowing when you can make, say, three moves with a knight in a row is part of overall mastery. It is useful to remember that such cases of 'breaking' the elementary rules given in beginner's books often arise when the opponent himself has made such errors first, and the need to punish him for it demands concrete reaction. Particular care should be taken over pawn moves since such moves cannot be taken back, and a weakness resulting from a bad pawn move is a permanent one. While busy with development and pressure on the centre it is a useful guide to bear in mind the overall strategic aim of that particular opening you have adopted, so that you may be consistent in following up the aim. Only in the case of forced variations should there be a need to go delving in opening books. Understanding general ideas and a mastery of the three fishes should give you the confidence to solve any opening task posed to you. Certain grandmasters keep an opening file, a collection of those variations which he will need during actual play, his own favourite lines. Such a file is handy and easily transportable so that it can be taken to a tournament. The reader may care to draw up such a file and notebook of his own, which will help him in preparing for his games. The Endgame The three fishes of chess mastery apply just as much here as to the opening or middle game, but the endgame does have its own specific features. First consider the transition to the endgame and the need to take a calm look at the new situation that has arisen. As Belavcnyets has pointed out, the middle game tends to put us in an excited frame of mind. With sacrifices and combinations in the air each Capablanca Ragozin, Moscow, 1936 The Endgame 201 As a result many formerly unclear questions have been clarified and the technique of playing positions such as R+ BP+ RP v R, 2N v pawns, Q+ P v Qand so on has been codified. In fact theoreticians have gone further by classifying the correct methods of play in many varied endings such as R+ P v R, all pawn endings and many queen endings. Is a grandmaster required to know all these analyses? Obviously not, but he does well to have an idea of their essential features. One feature that the ending shares with the middlegame is the need to understand rather than to remember. What is the best way to train in endings? You are obliged to master the elementary examples such as the square rule for pawn endings, R4-P on the 7th v R, consideration of the long and short sides of the passed pawn in rook and pawn endings. Then you have to consider those cases when a bishop is better than a knight or vice versa. After this you have to move on to endings with more material on the board. Once again we recommend the method of taking a position that has been analysed by a strong player: work through the moves yourself and compare your conclusions with the notes. As an example of this sort of approach, we take an interesting ending of some length by Rubinstein (213).
200 Calculation and Practical Play
He wrote thus:- 'White's plan is to prevent the advance of the enemy c- pawn which might make his own pawn at b2 weak, and to control the whole board as far as the fifth rank. This is achieved by playing the king to e3, the rook to c3, the knight to d4 and the pawns to b4 and f4. When this has been achieved White will advance his Q-side pawns'. Note- no variations! Nor does he worry about how much time the process might take. The main thing is the scheme, the formation that has to be reached. The next special feature is the change in the role of the king. No longer does he have to skulk in the corner for his own protection, there is an open field before him. In fact the participation of the king is often the decisive factor and it could well be that nothing fundamental should be undertaken until the king s role has been determined and his best position taken up. Exchanges give rise to the endgame, and in the ending exchanges are of paramount importance in accordance with the scheme 'What piece to exchange, what to leave on' (212) Alatortsev-Levenfish, Match 1940 White played 1 Jtd4 and Levenfish, a great master of the endgame, commented, 'The bishop had to be cherished like (he apple of his eye, since in the struggle against passed pawns the knight is not a very suitable piece.

The role ot knowledge in the ending is nowadays very great in view of the extensive study that has been carried out of typical positions. The results have been summarized in a number of books, amongst which the series edited by Averbakh takes first place. Faktor-Rubinstein, Lodz, 1916 First of all the assessment. White has weak squares at g4 and on the white squares generally. His pawn at e4 is weak and under threefold attack. Black's bishops are well placed, but he has the drawback of a doubled pawn which makes it harder for him to exploit his advantage. Black's plan is to improve his piece position by putting his bishop on g6 or h7, and his knight on g4. Then he will try to exploit his well placed pieces by advancing the K-side pawns. In the long run further pressure will

the game's great advantage, which makes it popular amongst millions who do not play the game themselves. The achievement of good results demands physical hardiness, strong nerves, endurance, calmness and the maintenance of a strict regime. As Alekhine put it, 'During a chess tournament a master must envisage himself as a cross between an ascetic monk and a beast of prey.' Fine words! A beast of prey towards the opponent, an ascetic in one's everyday life. Alas, Alekhine himself was not always an ascetic. Botvinnik and other members of the Soviet School have worked out the right approach to preparation and sporting regime. About a month before the tournament a player should study the games of his opponents-no easy task. You should also try to get up to date with latest theory and study your own play. Alekhine stressed the last named point, and you often hear in all competitive activities the advice that if you want to be strong you have to be hard on yourself. Opening preparation is also valuable, concentrating on those lines you intend playing in the event. If something that you do not know is published in one of these lines, you do well to try it out in two or three training games. The practice of using training games to get into trim has been widely used by a number of leading players, notably Botvinnik. On the other hand, other world champions have taken a sceptical view of training games on the grounds that they lack the stimulus of a real contest and so cannot be taken seriously enough. Not everybody can force himself to give of his best in such conditions. A short time before the event begins, you should have a break to avoid boredom or stalencss. Botvinnik said that he took a break about five days before the first round; I know of other grandmasters who make the break longer than that. During the actual tournament you have to make an effort to keep calm and husband your strength. 'I try to play in a calm fashion not letting my nerves worry me, and it's not so easy to achieve this. You have to bear this in mind constantly during the game. Calmness is not just for show; my mind only works well when I keep calm, so I specially train myself to cultivate this quality' (Botvinnik). In the 1946 Groningen tournament, the veteran grandmaster Bernstein reproached me for taking too much out of myself by playing to win in every game and creating sharp positions all the time. He warned me that my strength would give out before the end of -the 19 round tournament. He was right. I once checked up on my results in top class events and found that I had often lost my last round game; I was too exhausted to

Final Words of Advice In striving to play like a grandmaster one has to improve one's mastery of the three fishes, the three main components of play. To gain the grandmaster title however, more is demanded --practical results in international tournaments, so that approval will be given by the international ruling body FIDE. Many people consider the competitive side a drawback which takes something away from the game as an art. Yet I feel the sporting clement is

cope. Botvinnik too had difficulties in this regard; 'Earlier, as a rule, in almost all long tournaments I started off by garnering a lot of points, but then at the end could hardly "stick to the saddle". In the 12th 15th rounds I nearly always lost a game. It stands to reason that you must expend all your energy in that way. It is better to use it up in more even fashion so that there is no cracking up at the end, and the whole tournament will be less tense for you.' When I played in top class tournaments, and later when I used to be captain of the Soviet team or chief judge of a tournament, I watched the routine of a tournament day that grandmasters maintained. Only a few grandmasters have the habit of going to bed well after midnight and sleeping till noon -though you can't get to sleep straight away after a game. The majority of them had got into the habit of following Botvinnik's routine. In the morning after breakfast they would take a stroll for an hour, then do their preparation for the day's game. Then go on foot to the round, have supper after the game, and then to bed. No analysing adjourned games in the evening, though to be honest only Botvinnik himself could stop himself looking at them. I must insist though that you will save a lot of nervous energy if you don't look at adjourned games straight away. The main period of analysis of these should take place on the adjourned games day, but it is permissible to have a short look at them the morning after they are adjourned. • Folke Rogard, former President of FIDE, was once stressing that the factors of success at chess were not just good play and knowledge of the game, but good form and tiptop physical condition. He was interrupted by a reporter who objected that they were talking about chess not boxing. The Swede had his answer ready, if you have to play for up to five hours a day, spend hours analysing adjourned games and openings and on top of that often sleep badly because of the great nervous tension, then you were undergoing a physical burden as great as any boxer had! Our book is coming to an end. Whether you come to play like a grandmaster depends largely on you, your talent, character, persistence. I hope that working through this book will do you good, and if you make the grade I hope you will remember the contribution made by the author's advice. Solutions to the Exercises Diagram 32.

Also White has more space and can activate his king, something which Black cannot do. The plan is to provoke b6 which will finally imprison the black king on the back two rows. Then the bishop goes to the h2 /b8 diagonal and the king comes up to the centre so that Black cannot successfully attack White's pawns. Finally White's pawns move forward to take part in an attack on the circumscribed king.
