Game databases 166 Playing programs 169 Index of Names 174 Index of Openings 176 Introduction This book is aimed at players who are primarily interested in improving their re- sults. If you are prepared to lose nine games in order to score one brilliant victory, then it is probably not for you. However, most players are motivated at least partly by over-the-board success - the thrill of winning is one of the attractions of chess, and most players feel very satisfied when their rating improves. The level at which one plays is governed by a number of vague and poorly un- derstood factors. The first is what one might term 'natural talent'. By this I mean that combination of factors which sets an upper bound to the level one can achieve by training and practice. One cannot list precisely which factors are rele- vant, but one may divide the possible factors into two classes. The first class con- sists of non-chess-specific elements such as general intelligence and memory. The second class involves a mesh of inter-related chess factors such as the age at which one learnt the game, early chess education and so on. By the time anyone gets around to reading this book, the 'natural talent' factor will probably be immutable, which brings us to other factors which are more un- der one's control. These determine how closely one approaches the ceiling im- posed by one's 'natural talent'. It is my belief that most players never get anywhere near their natural ceiling, and that considerable improvement is possi- ble with appropriate education, training and practice. Most chess books aim to help readers improve their chess. An opening book, for example, will give gen- eral plans and concrete analysis, both to help the reader prepare his chosen open- ings and, after a game, to compare the course of the game with established theory. Clearly, concrete knowledge is an important factor in establishing chess strength; someone who has a detailed knowledge of rook and pawn endings will have an advantage over someone who does not. An assiduous program of self- training is bound to have a positive effect. In 1977, Jon Tisdall explained to me his plan for becoming a grandmaster. He had estimated how many hours of study were required to advance by one rating point. Multiplying this by the difference between his current rating and the grandmaster level gave the total number of hours of study required. I laughed, and pointed out that with each advance, the number of hours required to gain the next point would probably increase, and so he might never make it. However, his plan proved justified, because in 1995 he did indeed gain the grandmaster title. There are few players who can conduct a training program stretching over decades, and indeed time limitations apply to virtually all players. In practice this

restricts the amount of improvement possible on the 'chess knowledge' front. In this book I will give advice on how to use the time available for chess study most efficiently, for example by distinguishing essential knowledge from optional knowledge, and advising on the construction of an opening repertoire. The third factor, which is the main focus of this book, is the efficiency with which one applies the first two factors while actually sitting at the board. A de- tailed knowledge of rook and pawn endings won't help a bit if one has an attack of blind panic; an encyclopaedic memory is valueless if one is regularly seized by an uncontrollable impulse to sacrifice a piece unsoundly. Chaotic and mud- dled calculation; misjudgements; oversights; lack of confidence (or overconfi- dence!); lack of determination - these and many other negative influences all serve to whittle away one's playing strength. Such problems are not at all easy to solve, firstly because players very often do not realize what they are doing wrong and secondly because they imagine that there is nothing they can do to improve matters. This book includes a description of various common failings at the board. I think that many readers will reach a particular section and suddenly think "Yes, that's exactly the mistake I always make." Recognizing the problem is already the first step towards solving it. An awareness of when one is most likely to go wrong enables one to take special care in these 'danger situations'. Eventually, by concentrating on a particular weakness, it is often possible to eradicate it com- pletely. Since many of the matters dealt with in this book are psychological in nature, there will be quite a few examples from my own games - 1 can personally testify that muddled thinking occurs at grandmaster level! Where I have covered a fa- miliar topic, I have made an effort to replace, whenever possible, the standard time-worn examples with excerpts from contemporary play. Of course, this book, while containing much useful advice and information, cannot hope to go into detail about every aspect of the game. My aim has been merely to start the reader along the upward path of self-improvement. I hope that Secrets of Practical Chess will help readers to improve their results and produce more satisfying games. John Nunn Chertsey, 1997

Decision-making The Tree of Analysis revisited The so-called 'Tree of Analysis' was popularized in Kotov's famous book Think Like a Grandmaster. The analy- sis of any chess position has a tree-like structure. There are various alterna- tives in the current position, which form the main branches. Each alterna- tive permits a range of replies, which form slightly smaller branches, and so on. Since there are, typically, dozens of legal moves in an average chess position, a tree including every legal move rapidly becomes too dense for human beings to handle. Of course, it isn't necessary to consider every legal move, since a considerable percentage of these legal moves are nonsensical, and this tends to thin the tree some- what. Nevertheless, even if there are only five reasonable possibilities at each ply (we will borrow a term from the computer chess world and call half a move a ply), after three whole moves there are 15,625 'leaves'. It follows that analysing solely by means of an analytical tree is only possible when the number of reasonable possibilities for the two players is limited - in prac- tice this means tactical positions and certain types of endgame. However, one constructs some sort of analytical tree in thinking about almost any posi- tion; in less tactical situations, where the opponent's replies are much less predictable, one would not rely solely on the 'tree' but also take other factors into consideration. It follows that the 'Tree of Analy- sis' is a very important method of chess thinking; computers have shown that it is possible to play very strongly using practically nothing else. Kotov's book described in detail the mental processes involved in concrete analy- sis. If we assume that White is to move, then Kotov recommended that White form a list of 'candidate moves' which he is trying to decide between, making sure that the list is complete. For each of these, White creates a list of possible replies by Black and so on, following each branch in turn until a definite evaluation can be given. Ko- tov specifically warned against jump- ing from branch to branch; he thought that you should analyse each candi- date move until it can be definitely evaluated, and only then move on to the next one. The following example, which I have taken from Colin Crouch's inter- esting book Attacking Technique, is given as an exercise. It can be solved by Kotov's method, although this does

not mean to say that you will find it simple. L. Psakhis - D. King (analysis) L. Psakhis - D. King London (Lloyds Bank) 1994 Black actually blundered a piece away with 31...Nxe5?? 32 Qxd5+ Re6 33 Hxe5, but 31...Sxe5 is better. Crouch then remarks "The attempt at a tactical refutation ... with 32 £te7+ does not quite succeed: 32...Hxe7 33 Hxe7 Hxf2 34 Rxd5+ *h7! 35 Re4+ Hf5+! 36 *hl 2tf2+ 37 Hxf2 Qxf2 38 Sf7 *g6 39 Hxf5 Rxf5 40 Rxb4 with a draw." Your task is to choose a move after 34 Qxd5+ (D) in this line. The diagram is given at the top of the next column and the solution may be found on page 14. It is interesting to see how Kotov's method for, as he put it, teaching 'human beings to analyse with the ac- curacy of a machine' compares with the way machines actually calculate. In Figure 1 we see a stage in the computer's analysis of a position, with many branches removed for the sake of clarity. The computer analyses by a process of 'iterative deepening'. Let us suppose it is analysing a position in which it has to choose between 40 legal moves. It will analyse all legal sequences of moves to a particular depth, taking some branches deeper, especially those with forcing se- quences involving checks or captures. This will allow it to attach a numerical evaluation to all the 40 possibilities. Based on its evaluation, it will re- order the 40 moves to put the most promising ones (i.e. those with the highest evaluation) first. Then it will go one ply deeper, again analysing all possible legal sequences, and devoting Ar THE BOARD 9 more time to those moves early in the Your Chess Now, have discussed the pros and cons of Kotov's recommen- dations, but my concern is to give practical advice and not to get in- volved in an academic discussion. There are several problems which can arise as a result of Kotov's method. The most obvious is that it can be ex- tremely inefficient. Let us suppose that you are analysing a possible com- bination 1 Bxh7+ xh7 2 Ng5+. There are two defences, 2...<Ng6 and
2...<Bg8. You start analysing 2...<Bg6;
it is very complicated, but after twenty minutes you decide that White has the advantage. Then you start looking at
2...6g8. After a couple of minutes it
becomes obvious that this refutes the sacrifice. The upshot of Kotov's in- flexible approach is that you have lost twenty minutes' thinking time, solely on account of the bad luck of having chosen the wrong move to analyse first. A more rational approach would be to spend a couple of minutes look- ing at each of the two alternatives. It is possible that this will reveal one of them to refute the sacrifice, at which point Bxh7+ can be abandoned. It is also possible that the preliminary analysis will show one of them to be a clear-cut loss, in which case you can switch attention to the other one in the confidence that it is definitely the critical line. If both are unresolvable within a short time, then this is in it- self useful information. It shows that the task of determining whether the sacrifice is sound or not will require a Figure 2 shows a human being ana- lysing according to Kotov's recipe. He has listed three candidate moves and is in the process of analysing the first of these. He has not started analysing the other two. Figure 3 shows how a human actu- ally thinks. He has started analysing move A and discovered line Al. He wasn't especially impressed by it, so switched to analysing move B. He didn't like that move either, so he re- turned to his analysis of A, adding line A2 to his earlier efforts. He has either not got around to move C, or has sim- ply forgotten about it. More recent authors, such as Tis- dall (see the Introduction!) in Improve
10 SECRETS OF PRACTICAL CHESS
Bb7, but this leads to the same result after 1...&C7. Finally, there is 1 Ba6, which avoids the king fork, but after
1...6C7 White nevertheless must lose
a piece, as the knight is now trapped. This is all in accordance with Kotov's method. While looking at this last line, however, you notice a surprising point: after 1 Aa6 c7 White can try 2 Nc5 !?, with the idea that 2...Nxb8 3 Nd6 <Ba8 4 Nc7 leads to mate by 5 Bb7#. Having spotted this, it is cer- tainly worth noting that it might be possible to utilize it in the previously analysed lines. This jumping back is not in accordance with Kotov's method. Sure enough, after 1 Bb7 Nc7 White can play 2 Jla6, and again Black can- not take the knight. So which line is correct? The an- swer is that 1 Ba6 Nc7 2 Nc5 fails to
2...d6+ 3 <Nd5 xb8, and now 4 <Nxd6
<Na8 5 Nc7 is stalemate. White must prevent Black giving up his d-pawn, and so 1 Bb7! c7 2 Ba6! is the right line (2...d6 allows the knight out). Spotting a new idea may even cause you to change your list of candidate moves. Here is an example (D): White has just played 19 Sgl-g5. Black was threatening 19...£ki3+ fol- lowed by 20...Nc5+, but now this threat is nullified, because on the dis- covered check White can take on f5. Moreover, 20 Sxf5 gxf5 21 Sgl is a serious threat. My initial thought was the safety- first 19...e6, but after 20 hxg6 fxg6 21 Sdgl the position is just unclear, so I substantial time investment. Then the decision is really whether it is worth- while putting in the effort to analyse deeper. We will revisit this question of whether or not to analyse in the next section. A second problem with Kotov's method is that it fails to take into ac- count the synergistic effect of analys- ing several lines. The analysis of move A and that of move B are very often not independent of one another. Sup- pose you have rejected move A, but when analysing move B you suddenly notice a tactical possibility. It makes sense to return to move A to see if the same possibility is applicable there. Here is a simple example: J. Gunst Das Illustrierte Blatt, 1922 Clearly White has to move his bishop, so there are three possibilities. You look at 1 Bxd7, and note that l...Nc7 wins one of the two minor pieces by a fork. The next move is 1

However, having noticed the possi- bility of ...£}xa2+ in the variation with ..Bh6, 1 should have gone back to see if this affected my list of candidate moves. The key point is that the cap- ture on a2 becomes possible once the white queen no longer guards b2, and so the move 19..Bc2!! (D) springs to mind: A. Kuligowski - J. Nunn Wijk aan Zee 1983 started looking for alternatives. My eye was suddenly caught by a tactical idea. After 19..Bh6 the most obvious reply is 20 Sxf5, but then I wondered if some combination of ...Bxe3 and ...Nxa2+ might force mate. After some thought I established that 2O... xa2+!
21 Nxa2 (21 Bxa2 Nxe3) 21..>xb3
22 Jlxh6 Qxa2 wins for Black, and
concluded that after 19...Bh6 White would have to sacrifice the exchange on g5. The resulting positions ap- peared to give Black some advantage. The game continued:
19...M6! 20 Edgl Nxg5 21 Bxg5
e6 22 hxg6 fxg6 23 h5?I After 23 "g2 Bf6 24 h5 White would have had better chances of counterplay, although Black retains a large advantage with 24... c2.
23...5.7 24 Rg2 Sg7 25 h6 Sb7
26 Sxf5 exf5 27 Rxg6+ *h8 28 Rg2
After 28 Bg5 Rxd4 Black defends.
28...f4 29 £gl Eg8 0-1
White is now completely helpless, for example: 1) 20 Nxd5 Nxa2+ 21 *xc2 Qxb3+ 22 *bl Sb7 23 hxg6 f5 wins for Black. 2) 20 Sdgl Nxa2+ 21 Nxa2 Qxb3
22 Qxc2 Rxa2 is also decisive.
3) 20 hxg6 Nxa2+ 21 <Nxc2 (21 Nxa2 Nxb3) 21...Qxb3+ 22 *d3 <Nxc3 23 bxc3 Rc4+ 24 *c2 Ra2+ 25 <Nd3 Sb2 wins the queen. There are also some types of chess calculation which have nothing to do with the 'Tree of Analysis'. One of these is the 'goal-seeking' approach. Here is an example:
12 SECRETS OF PRACTICAL CHESS
17 Nxh7+ <Nxh7 18 "h5+ *g8 19
Nxg7 Nxg7 20 Rg4+ <Nh7 21 Sf3 1-0 You can never find a move like 16 ?)b6! by using the tree of analysis (un- less you are a computer) because it makes absolutely no sense except as part of the whole tactical operation, and therefore will not make it onto your list of 'candidate moves'. Here is a more sophisticated exam- G. Kuzmin - E. Sveshnikov ple. USSR Ch, Moscow 1973 The position seems tailor-made for a double bishop sacrifice on h7 and g7, the only problem being that it doesn't work: 16 Jlxh7+ Nxh7 17 Qh5+ *g8 18 Nxg7 *xg7 19 Qg4+ h7 20 Sf3 (of course White can give perpetual check) 20...Nxf4 21 Sxf4 f5 defends. In order to win, White has to isolate the element that makes the sacrifice fail (i.e. the possibility of ...?)xf4) and ask a 'What if...' ques- tion, in this case 'What if I could de- flect the knight away from d5?'. Then the solution becomes obvious:
16 Nb6! Nxb6
It does not help if Black moves his rook, for example 16...Sb8 17 ?)xd5 cxd5 18 Nxh7+ *xh7 19 Qh5+ *g8
20 Nxg7 Qxc5+ 21 *hl <Nxg7 22
Qg4+ *h8 23 Sf3 Rc2 24 f5! Rxf5
25 Sxf5 exf5 26 Qh3+ (had Black
played 16...Sa7, White would now have 26 Qd4+) followed by Qg3+ and the rook on b8 falls. V. Anand - J. Lautier Biel 1997 There are so many pieces hanging that it takes a few moments to grasp what is going on in this position! White is set to lose the exchange on e3, but the bishop on g2 is trapped, so it looks as if the most likely outcome is a position with, for example, two bish- ops against a rook and two pawns. However, Anand had an imaginative tactical idea, namely to sacrifice his
AT THE BOARD 13
queen with the astonishing move 20 Bg6. Unfortunately, after 20 Bg6 Wxdl 21 Sxe6+ Black can just run with his king by 21...<Bf8 22 Ba3+ (22 2xf7+ g8) 22...Ne7 23 Nxe7+ Ng8 and White is losing. Now White can ask 'What if I had a pawn on h6?'. Then the line with 2xf7+ would lead to mate as 2xg7+ followed by Ba3+ would be possible. 20 h6!!gxh6? Black apparently hadn't seen An- and's idea at all, or he would have tried
20... xe3, although White retains the
advantage after 21 Bxe3 Re5 22 hxg7 2g8 23 Wcl !. Of course, the variation
20...g6 21 Bxg6 represents the fulfil-
ment of White's idea. 21 i.g6!I e7 Now that h6 is available for White's bishop, the line 21...Qxdl 22 2xe6+ *f8 23 Nxh6+ *g8 24 Nxf7# ends in mate.
22 Rxd4 2xd4 23 2d3! 2d8 24
2xd8+ *xd8 25 Nd3! 1-0 The tree of analysis is certainly a useful technique in tactical positions, but it should be used flexibly and sup- plemented by other types of chess thinking. One has to strike a balance between the rigid application of Ko- tov's principles and jumping from one variation to another too much. In par- ticular, I favour the 'quick scan' ap- proach, looking briefly at all the major lines to see if any can be quickly re- solved. With any luck, this will be enough to settle the analysis; if not, at least you know where the tricky areas lie. The most common errors in 'tree' analysis are: 1) Forgetting to analyse a move completely. This is surprisingly easy to do. After spending twenty minutes analysing defences A and B to your intended sacrifice, you decide that it is sound and play it. The instant your hand has left the piece you remember defence C, which you had noticed but not analysed. 2) Confusing similar lines. If you are jumping about a lot between rather similar variations, then it is easy to get mixed up as to which position came from which line. In other words, al- though you have the positions clear in your mind, the links between them which form the branches of the 'tree' have become muddled. You may need to start rebuilding the 'tree' in your mind from scratch when this hap- pens. While a certain amount of mental discipline can greatly increase the effi- ciency of your tactical analysis, a great deal still depends on 'natural talent'. It would be quite easy to overlook the whole idea of Bg6 in the Anand- Lautier position above, and in this case a wonderfully organized tree of variations will not help you. But then, Lautier missed it too, so at least you would not be alone. Now we return to the exercise on page 8. Here is the diagram again:

Evaluation functions When computers analyse a position, they create a tree of analysis, and then use a rather crude evaluation function to assess the position at the end of every branch. Then, by working back- wards, they can evaluate the current position and establish what they con- sider to be the optimal line of play. If a computer had a perfectly accurate evaluation function, then it would not need to analyse the position more than one ply ahead - it could simply evalu- ate the position after each legal move and choose the one with the highest evaluation. The effect of analysis is to increase the accuracy of the fairly primitive evaluation function. Humans tend to analyse in a differ- ent way, but they still use an evalua- tion function. While they may not think they have an advantage of 0.32 pawns, it is quite normal to think 'Well, at the end of this line I have a slight/fair/clear/crushing advantage.' After looking at various lines the hu- man decides on the best. This process is rather similar to that performed by the computer. However, the human also typically uses an evaluation function in a differ- ent way. If you think that you have an advantage in the current position, then you automatically reject moves which allow your opponent total equality. L. Psakhis - D. King (analysis) Crouch's 34...Nh7 is actually the weakest of the three king moves, and leads to a draw, as in his analysis. Initially I thought that 34...Nh8 was winning, since any check on the eighth rank is met by ...Sf8+, and oth- erwise White has no defence to the threats against his king. However, Fritz found an incredible defence: 35 Se8+ Sf8+ 36 *hl Sxe8? 37 Sf8+! Sxf8 (after 37...*h7 38 Rf5+ Black is worse) 38 Qg8+! forcing stalemate. Therefore, Black would have to play
36...£tf2+ 37 Sxf2 Sxe8, with a large
advantage although no forced win. The final move, 34... f8, is actu- ally the strongest and leads to a forced win for Black, although it appears the least likely move because it self-pins the f2-rook. White can only try 35 Se2 Hf6+ 36 Sff2 (36 Hef2 Sxf2 37 Ra8+ *e7 38 Re4+ *f6 wins) 36...Sxf2 37 Qa8+, but there is no perpetual check:
37...*f7 38 Qe8+ (38 Qd5+ *f6)
38...*f6 39 "e7+ (39 Rf8+ *g6)
AT THE BOARD 15
This type of reasoning is very com- mon and is extremely useful in rapidly cutting down the number of moves that you have to consider, but it also has its dangers. It is almost the reverse of the computer's logic; instead of us- ing the analysis to evaluate the posi- tion, the 'evaluation' is used to prune the analysis tree. However, because the initial 'evaluation' is not based on concrete analysis of the current posi- tion, it is inherently unreliable. Typi- cally, players simply carry over their evaluation from the preceding move and use it as a starting point for the next one. If the evaluation is inaccu- rate, then all kinds of odd things can start to happen. Suppose you have three possible moves, A, B and C, and believe that you have the advantage. You analyse A and decide that it leads to equality; B the same. You then con- clude that C must be the correct move with very little analysis. If the position is in fact equal, then C may actually lead to a disadvantage, although you do not realize this immediately. Then, because you tend to carry over evalua- tions from one move to the next, you repeat this exercise in defective logic the next move. The upshot is a whole string of inaccurate moves; this is, in fact, what is commonly known as 'lo- sing the thread of the game'. If you experience 'losing the thread', try af- terwards to trace the problem back to its root cause; surprisingly often, the source of the error was a faulty evalua- tion. Y. Seirawan - J. Nunn Brussels World Cup 1988 King's Indian Defence Id4 f62c4g63 c3i.g74e4d65 f3 O-O 6 Be3 Nc6 7 &ge2 a6 8 d5

I was very happy with the result of the opening. It seemed to me that 8 d5 was premature, giving Black a target to aim at with ...c6 and ...e6. In the dia- gram position, I felt that the move f3 was not only a loss of time, but even served to weaken White's dark squares, especially e3. It is thanks to this that White cannot castle (allowing the e3- bishop to be exchanged by ...Nc4 and ... e3 would really be bad for White). Therefore I assessed the position as slightly better for Black, but this was just wrong. Perhaps White has not played the opening in optimal style, but a small inaccuracy by White is not enough to hand Black the advantage; he has equalized, but no more.

I could also have simply developed by 14...Bd7 15 O-O Bc8, but once again this hardly promises Black more than equality. 15 *f2 Of course 15 O-O? £}c4! and 15 Bd4?! Nc4 are fine for Black, but the fact that White had to play this artificial-looking king move seemed to justify my earlier assessment. I was now quite excited about various tacti- cal possibilities involving a bishop or knight moving to g4, but at the mo- ment no such idea is effective.

Continuing my plan to 'punish' White for his opening play. Since there was no immediate tactical blow, the only way to keep the momentum going seemed to be by pushing the h- pawn.

17... h5? (D)
Up to this point Black has not made any real error, but now his desire to play for the advantage leads him badly astray. Originally I intended 17...h3, thinking that after 18 g4 there would be some combination based on taking the g4-pawn. Now I discovered that there was no such combination. I be- came frustrated by my inability to find a continuation consistent with my ear- lier active play. The result was the very weak text-move, based on a trap which doesn't even work! The right plan was 17... h7 (pre- venting Bg5) 18 f4 ?)g4+ 19 Bxg4 Nxg4 20 Nd4 Nxd4+ (2O...>8 21 2te3 favours White) 21 Rxd4 Rf6 22 Rxf6 <5W6 leading to a roughly equal Ar THE BOARD 17

The sacrifice 19... xg4 20 fxg4 Nxc3 21 bxc3 Re4 is refuted by 22 •Nf3! Rxf3 23 gxh5, so the knight has to retreat with loss of time. White now made the very weak move 25 gxf6?, which allowed the dead knight on h7 back into the game; after many complications the game ended in a draw. Had Seirawan continued 25 Wdl f5

then Black would have been in trou- ble. The d6-pawn is under fire and the h7-knight can only emerge in the dis- tant future. Even the solid 25 Sfl would have given White a clear advan- tage. In this example the chain of events was: a bad assessment of the position, resulting in over-ambitious play by Black; then avoidance of drawing lines, leading to the awful 17... h5?. Black only got back on track after his position had severely deteriorated.
18 SECRETS OF PRACTICAL CHESS
When to analyse One question which Kotov did not really cover is whether to analyse at all, or how much to analyse. Yet this is of great practical importance. One might end up playing better moves if one could analyse for an unlimited time, but games played before the in- troduction of chess clocks (and some postal games) show that this is not necessarily the case. Too much analy- sis can easily lead to fatigue and con- fusion. These days the tendency is towards faster and faster time-limits, and this means that apportioning one's thinking time becomes ever more cru- cial. When analysing a given position, it is fair to say that one almost always sees more in the first five minutes than in the next five minutes. The five min- utes after that is even less productive, and so on. I have observed that if a player spends more than 20 minutes over a move, the result is almost al- ways a mistake. The normal decision- making process should not take longer than this, even in fairly complex situa- tions. There will, of course, always be exceptions to any such empirical law, but in this case they are fairly rare. If a player takes a long time over a move, the reason is usually either indecision or inability to find a satisfactory con- tinuation. It is very unusual for the po- sition to be so complicated that it really demands more than 20 minutes' thought. If you have thought about a position for some time and are still unsure what to play, then it is essential to be ruth- lessly pragmatic. You have to ask yourself whether further thought is really going to help you make a better decision. Suppose your lengthy cogi- tation is the result of indecision; for example, say there are two moves, both of which have roughly equal merit. If you have not been able to decide be- tween them up to now, it is reasonable to suppose that there is in fact little to choose between them. Considerable further thought might eventually re- veal some tiny difference, but it is rare that this expenditure of time is worth- while. First of all, it is easy to be wrong when dealing with such fine distinc- tions and secondly, gaining an infini- tesimal advantage is of little value if the result is that you run into time- trouble and blunder away a piece. Games are decided by very small ad- vantages far less often than is usually supposed. There are players, such as Capablanca and Karpov, with the abil- ity to convert a small advantage into a win on a regular basis, but this talent is rare even amongst grandmasters. Games in which the players make er- rors and the advantage swings back and forth are far more common; in the end the decision comes about as a re- sult of a serious mistake. My advice is to obey your instinctive feeling as to which of the two moves is better or, if you don't have any preference, just choose at random. I have occasionally
AT THE BOARD 19
been tempted to toss a coin at the board, but despite the undoubted psy- chological impact on the opponent, this does seem rather unsporting. If you are unable to find a satisfac- tory continuation, then once again it usually does not help to think on and on hoping for a miracle. Of course, if it is a question of coming up with some- thing or resigning, then you may as well continue, but this is uncommon. Usually, you are better off playing what appears to be the least unfavour- able continuation and saving the time for accurate defence and possible counterplay later on. It is worth noting that if you are generally unhappy with your position, then this might well be colouring your assessments. Before choosing a move, it is probably worth having a quick review of the alterna- tives and the reasons why you deemed them unsatisfactory, to see if they are really as bad as you imagine. It is not unusual suddenly to find that your in- tended equal continuation is slightly worse for you; you then look at more and more unfavourable possibilities, become deeply depressed about your position, and forget that the first line you looked at wasn't actually all that bad. Another common time-waster is instinctively to want to play a certain move and then to spend a long time trying to back up this intuitive feeling with concrete analysis. Don't do this. If your intuition is telling you strongly to play move X, then you will probably play it in the end anyway and further thought is only going to waste time. The situation which represents the worst of all worlds is when you want to play X, but can't find any objective reason for doing so; then you analyse and analyse until you find some half- baked and dubious reason why X is a good move. Then you end up playing a dubious move and spending a lot of time. However, it is usually worth- while spending a few minutes trying to find something concrete wrong with your intuitive choice, because posi- tional intuition doesn't insure against the possibility that it might be bad for tactical reasons. If, during these few minutes you don't find anything wrong, then you should just play the move. The following game is a successful example of playing (almost!) without calculation. J.

I thought for a few minutes about the direct 20 Qg4, when Black has almost no choice but to play 20...Qxe5. Then it looks as though there must be a tactical possi- bility using the long diagonal, but I could only see one idea: 21 df5 Qxb2 22 Nxh6+ Nh7 23 Nxf7 "xc2

However, even a quick glance is enough to show that the analysis of this line will be very complicated: in the middle Black can try 24...Sxe4, or he may decline the second piece and play, for example, 23...W6. Here is a case in which a quick scan of the other possibilities is much bet- ter than the twenty minutes or so which would have been required to as- sess this double piece sacrifice. I first looked at 20 Ngf5 Sxe5 21 Qg4 g6, but there seemed to be nothing clear. Then the text-move occurred to me and I was at once attracted to it. After 2O...fxe6 21 xe4 dxe4 22 Bxe4 Bxe4 23 Sxe4 Black has a miserable position; the e6-pawn is weak, the

It seemed to me that it would be very hard to put the extra pawn to good use in such a position. Looking back on it, I think this line would also have been somewhat better for White, since Black still has trouble using his knight effectively. The more dynamic game continuation is at least as good, and presents Black with diffi- cult decisions. In general, White would be quite happy for Black to exchange knights on g3, as then he would have an auto- matic attack by Rd3 (meeting ...g6 by e6). However, I was not prepared to spend a tempo on forcing it by playing 19 f3. Moreover, this move both weak- ens the a7-gl diagonal and blocks the

DAUT
This acronym means: if in doubt, 'Don't Analyse Unnecessary Tactics'. Tactical analysis is an error-prone activity. Overlooking one important finesse can completely change the re- sult of the analysis. If it is possible to decide on your move on purely posi- tional considerations then you should do so; it is quicker and more reliable. There are, of course, many positions in which concrete analysis is essential, a5-knight remains offside and White can step up his pressure with natural moves such as Rg4 and Hael. Best of all, it is simple and risk-free. Home analysis shows that the dou- ble piece sacrifice leads to a draw: af- ter 25 Ng5+ g8 26 Qh5 in the above line, Black can respond 26...e3! and White has nothing more than perpet- ual check.
20...W4
Another rather unexpected move. 21 xe4 dxe4 22 g3 Again a simple choice. In order to avoid losing the pawn on e4, Black's queen must move onto the long diago- nal, but then White has various tactical ideas based on moving the d4-knight.
22..."e5
After 22..>f6 23 Rd2 b4 24 Nxe4 Black will be lucky to escape with only the loss of a pawn.
23 Rg4
It is important to take into account any finesse which might make the win easier. Here White has the choice be- tween 23 Re2 and 23 Rg4 h5 24 Qe2. The latter is clearly superior for two reasons. Firstly the protruding pawn on h5 is a weakness, as it will be unde- fended; secondly, the weakening of the g5-square may allow White to oc- cupy it later with his knight, creating a permanent danger to Black's king. This is an example of the method of comparison (page 44).
23...h5
There is nothing better. 23...Bb4 24 He2 is no different, while 23...fxe6 24

but even in these cases you should not analyse specific variations more than necessary. The following example is a mar- ginal case. J. Nunn - M. Pfibyl Bundesliga 1995/6 Giuoco Piano

Nc5 5 O-O d6 6 c3 O-O 7 Nbd2 a6 8 Nb3 Na7 9 h3 Nd7 10 Nc2 f5 11 exf5 Sxf5 12 d4 Hf8 Black has played the opening in a rather provocative manner, aiming to open the f-file and create counterplay by attacking f2. However, the cost has been retarded development.
13 Ne4
After 13 d5 Ne7 14 Ng5 15 Nde4 White has secure control over e4, which would warm the heart of anyone who plays against the King's Indian. Unfortunately for White, the black bishop is on a7 rather than g7, and the pressure on f2 gives Black rea- sonable counterplay.
13...exd4 (D)
With quite a few of White's pieces pointing at Black's naked kingside, there is clearly potential for a forcing continuation, but which move should he choose? 14 eg5, 14 fg5, 14 Jlb3+ and 14 Jlg5 are all reasonable continuations. I would regard this as a borderline case for deciding whether to spend the time to analyse every- thing thoroughly. The position does indeed look promising on purely stra- tegic grounds, but the wide range of moves at White's disposal indicates that a complete analysis will be very time-consuming. In the end I decided on a straight- forward forcing continuation which gives White a slight positional advan- tage. In fact White could have secured a larger advantage by another line, but that is the risk one takes in making a decision not to look too deeply into a position. However, I would certainly have taken my time had there not been an advantageous alternative. 14 &eg5 Here is an analysis of the other pos- sibilities: 1) 14 i.g5 Qe8 15 Sei de5 16 Nxd4 Bxh3! 17 gxh3 Bxd4 18 cxd4 £rf3+ 19 <Ng2 Nxel+ 20 Wxel Nxd4 and Black is slightly better. 2) 14 Rd3 £ce5 15 xe5 2>xe5 16 2rf6+ Qxf6 17 Qxh7+ *f7 de- fends. 3) 14 Bb3+ *h8 15 £fg5 Re7 (not 15... de5 16Nxh7!) 16 2)e6 (16

How- ever, I still prefer White because his king is completely safe, while Black's has only one pawn for protection. switch his bishop to the long diagonal, or bring his rook into the attack, and the game will be over. The lines are quite straightforward and forcing, so there is little possibility of error.

the upshot is at best 'unclear'. It is then incredibly hard to write your analysis off as a waste of time and start thinking about alternative ideas. Even- tually you convince yourself to play the tactical line with an argument like 'well, he probably won't find his way through all the complications, and even then he doesn't have any advan- tage'. Thus you end up playing a move which is objectively not the best, and it is amazing how often one's opponent does indeed find his way through the complications once they have been forced on him. prepared to sacrifice the rook on gl to achieve it. The game continued with the complex tactical variation 19 f4! 2tf3 20 Rg2 xgl 21 e5 O-O 22 Nd3 ! Bxe5! 23 fxe5 Qxh4 24 Hxgl Rf4+ 25 &bl ! Qxe5. Even for a grandmas- ter, working one's way through this line is far from easy, but that is not the end of it. In the resulting position Black has a rook and three pawns for a bishop and a knight, on paper a con- siderable material advantage. How- ever, Anand showed that after 26 Qc5 ! White's initiative prevents Black from co-ordinating his pieces. He went on to win very nicely. One can hardly criticize Anand's choice, as it did give him the advan- tage in a very forcing way, but for or- dinary mortals (and normal GMs such as myself) this continuation would be a distinct leap in the dark. If faced with the diagram position, it would be rea- sonable to spot 19 f4 and think "Well, that may be good, but it's very compli- cated. I'll analyse it if I have to, but is there another line which gives me the advantage and involves less risk?" The move 19 Be2 is natural; it threatens f4 and e5 without any sacrifice at all. Black cannot blockade White's pawns with 19...g5 because 20 hxg5 hxg5 21 Qxb4 (or 20 "xb4 gxh4 21 Sxd4) is very good for White. Anand did not play this move because of 19...d3, which is indeed the only reasonable reply. However, White can then con- tinue 20 Re3! and Black is in big trou- ble. The threat of f4 and e5 is renewed, V. Anand - G. Kamsky Linares 1994 In this position a great deal depends on White's mobile e- and f-pawns. If he can set them moving by f4 and e5, gaining tempi with both moves, then Black will be dead lost. At the moment, however, Black threatens a fork on f3. Anand decided that forcing through f4 and e5 was so important that he was

He cannot castle ow- ing to 26 xh6, the g7-pawn is hang- ing, White threatens Rc5 and the bishop is dominated by the powerful centralized knight. This variation is fairly straightforward to calculate, and probably not really necessary as after
22 b6 it is already clear that White
stands very well. Thus White could have gained at least as much advan- tage as in the game with the simple move 19 Be2. It is easy to imagine that having calculated the difficult and attractive line with 19 f4, White was not eager to find an equally good sim- ple alternative, even though moves like 19 Be2 and 20 Qe3 are child's play to someone such as Anand. Safety-nets When you are thinking about a com- plex and lengthy tactical line, espe- cially one involving sacrifices, it helps to have a safety-net, i.e. an alternative line which you can adopt if, half-way through your intended continuation, you discover that it doesn't work. The simplest type of safety-net is when you have a perpetual check in hand (D). This looks like a fairly normal Naj- dorf Sicilian, but Shirov found an imaginative tactical idea.

Shirov based his sacrifice largely on intuition. In this position, with Black's king seriously exposed, he must have felt that there would very likely be a way to play for a win. Moreover, at the back of his mind there was the com- forting knowledge that if in fact there was no winning attempt, he had the safety-net of perpetual check to fall back on. 23 xc5 Rxc5 24 e5! A risk-free method of playing for a win. This introduces the d3-bishop into the attack, and possibly the c3- knight as well, while all the time re- taining the option of perpetual check.

Shirov now thought carefully about the various options for playing on. This raises the question as to why he embarked on the combination if he had no idea how he was going to con- tinue at this stage. The answer is that even a leading grandmaster such as Shirov is human.

When the tactics have to work If you initiate tactics which involve a large commitment and have no safety- net, then you have no margin for error at all. Thus you have to be absolutely sure that your idea works, and it is probably worth double-checking eve- rything before you commit yourself.

A. Yusupov - L. Portisch Tunis Interzonal 1985 In this position Black has already moved his king and so cannot castle kingside. White has just attacked the c-pawn with Nb5 and 18..Bd6 would be a normal reply. Yusupov certainly has some compensation for the pawn as Portisch's king is stuck in the cen- tre, but Black's pieces are fairly well placed and he is, at any rate, not worse. However, Portisch now decided to play a combination.

Portisch was certainly aware that taking the knight with the b-pawn would expose his king too much, and the text-move was the point of his idea. He aims to take the knight with a piece, leaving the b7-pawn to defend his knight and provide his king with adequate defence.
21 Hedl+ <4>c8 (D)
The critical moment. Portisch has staked the game on his ability to take the knight with a piece. If he fails, then he will inevitably lose because the con- cessions he has made in order to trap the knight are so large. He has been prepared to go a pawn down (two pawns have been sacrificed, but he was a pawn up in the diagram posi- tion) and, just as important, he has been prepared to expose his own king seriously. In view of the total lack of any safety-net, Portisch should have made absolutely sure that there was no hole in his calculations. 22 b4! Yusupov pinpoints the flaw in the whole concept. Black does not now win a piece and his position has been irreparably damaged.

Ra4+ Nc5 33 Nd2 1-0 Implicit commitments Almost every move in chess involves some sort of commitment. A pawn move cannot be reversed and with each advance the pawn permanently loses the ability to control certain squares. Even a piece move is a commitment; if the piece turns out to be badly placed on its new square, it may have to go into reverse, with consequent loss of time. However, the degree of commit- ment is important. A piece sacrifice involves a greater degree of commit- ment than a natural developing move. We have already discussed the more obvious types of commitment earlier. However, there is a more subtle type of commitment, which we call im- plicit commitment. Very often, a cer- tain type of commitment is bound up in a player's choice of opening. A player as White adopting the Velimi- rovic Attack in the Sicilian (one of the main lines of which runs 1 e4 c5 2 3 Nc6 3 d4 cxd4 4 Nxd4 2tf6 5 c3 d6
6 Bc4 e6 7 Ne3 kel 8 Re2 a6 9 O-O-O
Rc7 10 Bb3 O-O 11 g4) is committing himself to an all-out kingside attack, which may involve sacrifices, and if he is hesitant about giving up material then he has simply chosen the wrong opening. Of course, this is an extreme example - there are few opening varia- tions as one-sided as the Velimirovic Attack, but the same general principle applies in many openings. For exam- ple, it is not unusual for a player to seize a long-term strategic advantage in return for piece activity or a lead in development. In this case the player with the better development has taken on an implicit commitment to under- take rapid action. Advantages such as a lead in development are inherently temporary, because when the oppo- nent has brought out all his pieces the advantage disappears. A common mis- take is to take on such a position, but not to appreciate that the long-term chances lie with the opponent. The re- sult is a fatal lack of urgency. Here is an example. J. Nunn - J. Mellado Leon 1997 French Defence

After looking at 8...dxc4 be- fore the game, I quite liked the result- ing positions for White, so I decided to go down the same variation.

10...2tec6 11 O-O (D)
trouble feeding across to the other side of the board. In the endgame the pawn is more likely to promote, as there are fewer pieces available to keep it under control. Black would probably have to assign one piece to keep a watchful eye on the pawn, leaving him a man short elsewhere. The only caveat here is that White should not exchange too many pieces in an endgame, since then Black could use his king as the block- ading piece. In return for White's long-term as- set, Black's minor pieces can converge to attack the e5-pawn and for some time White will be tied down to its de- fence. Moreover, Black's development is quite good, especially as White will have to invest some time in regaining the pawn on c4. However, these com- pensating factors are all temporary, and given time White will complete his development and reorganize his forces to defend e5 efficiently. Black has therefore taken on a heavy implicit commitment either to keep White off- balance or to convert his temporary advantages into something more per- manent before White puts his house in order. If Black has not achieved some- thing concrete within the next half- dozen moves, then we can safely pre- dict that he will be in trouble. White, on the other hand, can con- tent himself with more modest play. All he need do is consolidate his po- sition and bring all his pieces into play and Black will 'automatically' be worse. Of course, this might have been This is a typical case of implicit commitment. The extra pawn is not relevant, as White will win back the c4-pawn in a few moves. The key fac- tor is that Black has allowed White to drive a wedge into the middle of his position. The protected passed pawn is not going to promote in the near future - there are simply too many pieces on the board for that - but it is an asset both in the middlegame and in the endgame. In the middlegame it stifles the activity of Black's pieces and cuts communication between the queen- side and kingside. This could help White to mount a kingside attack, for Black's queenside pieces would have
32 SECRETS OF PRACTICAL CHESS
quite difficult if Black had continued accurately, but nevertheless White's position is easier to play. He has a very clear-cut aim, while Black must try to generate counterplay 'somehow', i.e. he has to formulate a plan from scratch, whereas White's plan is handed to him on a plate. This is a typical situation in such 'long-term advantage vs piece play' situations. The piece-play side has much more work to do, at least to begin with, to find the best plan. If he succeeds, then the other side may also have to think carefully about how to contain his opponent's counterplay, but if he does not succeed the game can be quite easy. To my surprise, Black spent very little time over the next few moves and only started to think when he was al- ready in considerable difficulties. Evi- dently he did not appreciate that this is the critical phase of the game and ordi- nary developing moves will not be enough. From all this we can learn an im- portant lesson. At the end of the open- ing, spend a few minutes deciding whether one player has the better long-term chances. This may be obvi- ous simply from the opening variation chosen (for example, in the Exchange Ruy Lopez it is obviously White who has the better long-term chances), but if it is at all unclear then it is worth spending time on this question. The strategy for the two players may then be quite clear: one side must aim to consolidate and contain his opponent; the other must play to stir up trouble quickly.
11... d7 12 Sei g6 13 Na3
The first task is to regain the pawn on c4.
13...Ng7
Black cannot hang on to the pawn by 13...Ra6 14 Re2 b5 because 15 b3 breaks up the queenside pawn struc- ture and regains the pawn in a more advantageous way.

After 18 Sadi, for instance, Black can continue 18...c4 and try to plant a knight on d3 (for which White will probably have to give up the ex- change). 16 i.f4 b6 If now 16...b5, then White replies 17 ?)cd2; thanks to Black's inaccurate 15th move, the knight can retreat to the centre rather than to a3. 17 b3 White must not allow the exchange of queens. His own queen is well placed in the centre of the board, while Black's is marooned on the queenside, so such an exchange would clearly fa- vour Black.
17... d5
The transfer of the knight to d5 has blocked the d-file and prevented White backing up his pawn with a rook at dl , but it has also relieved the pressure on the e5-pawn.
18.fi.g3
Now the defects of Black's earlier play start to become apparent. Cer- tainly he has developed his pieces, but he has done nothing to prevent White doing the same. All other things being equal, the position will favour White because of his superior structure. More and more, Black struggles to find con- structive moves. He can only under- mine White's pawns by ...f6, but then White would swap on f6, leaving the e6-pawn hopelessly weak.
18...h6
Black wants to prevent White sup- porting his d-pawn by a later .fi.h4, covering the queening square, but we can already see that Black is running out of ideas.
19 Re4
A typical move from the player who has time on his side. It does not create any immediate threat, but tidies up White's position by unpinning the c4-knight. Black also has the worry that the white queen might now switch to the kingside and form the basis of a direct attack.
19...5ac8 20 h4
Both relieving White's back rank (his king would be very safe on h2) and making another threatening ges- ture against Black's king.
20...b5 21 Ne3 (D)
White aims to open the d-file by re- moving Black's best-placed piece, the blockading knight on d5.
21... cb4?
The correct plan is indeed to use the second knight to restore the d-file blockade, but this move is a tactical er- ror which leads to the loss of material.

Hxa8 40 cb3 1-0 Positional thinking Although precise analysis plays some part in most chess situations, posi- tional thinking is just as important. Even in sharp situations, positional factors can still play a major part; for example, there is little point in playing a combination winning the exchange if the result is a position riddled with weaknesses (see Sax-Stean on page 105). Unfortunately, if you have little natural talent for it, positional think- ing is one of the most difficult aspects of chess to learn. One often hears of how a certain player has a 'natural feel' for the pieces and instinctively puts them on the right squares. This is either an innate ability or something which is learnt by experience. If you have played over and studied thou- sands of games, and seen all the differ- ent patterns and plans which can arise from the main openings, then you al- ready have a good start when it comes to positional play. Most players do not have the time for this sort of study and must focus their efforts where they will do the most good.

opening repertoire. Most openings give rise to certain distinctive central pawn structures. Some pawn structures are particular to just one opening. Look, for example, at the following diagram: Accepted, Nimzo-Indian, etc. If such pawn structures arise in your reper- toire, it pays to look not only at games with 'your' opening, but at others which give rise to identical central pawn structures. If you have a data- base program with a 'position search' facility, then you can use this to find which openings result in a particular pawn structure. Once you have identified the main pawn structures relevant to your open- ings, then try to find games resulting in these structures. Once again, a data- base program makes this easy. If there are too many games to play over, then restrict yourself to games by grand- masters - there is no point playing over games in which the players adopt quite inappropriate plans. It is much better if the games are annotated, pref- erably with words rather than sym- bols. Languageless annotations are fine for displaying tactical analysis, but when it comes to explaining the plans for both sides, there is no substi- tute for a clear explanation in words by someone who really understands the opening. Opening books which emphasize general ideas and plans may also be of help. For each pawn structure, try to play over about fifty games. This should be enough to give you an idea both of the typical plans adopted by both players, and of which plans tend to succeed. The idea is not really to learn what to play in specific positions, but to see what the two players are trying to do, You don't need to see the position of the pieces to know that it's almost certainly a Winawer French. On the other hand, look at the following dia- gram: It could be virtually anything: Caro- Kann, 2 c3 Sicilian, Queen's Gambit

point, which comes into play later in the game, is that White's al -rook may emerge via a3. Of course, this slightly unusual idea is hardly enough to win the game by it- self, but it puts Onishchuk off his stride. Instead of the normal patterns in this system, he has to work out a plan for himself. As we shall see, Ad- ams has a much better grasp of the re- quirements of the position.
7...Ne6 8 Hel Nxc4 9 dxc4!
Once again taking the chance to steer the game along original paths. The mechanical reply would be 9 Qxc4, when the knight could later drop back to e3. However, Adams chooses a dif- ferent move, which greatly strength- ens his grip on d5. He has already formulated his plan for the next phase of the game: to increase his control of the light squares as much as possible, with particular reference to d5 and f5. Rather unusually, this is the only plan he needs to win the game! The first step is to transfer his knight from d2 to e3.
9...5.8 10
Preparing £te3, taking aim at both critical squares.
10...Bf8?
A definite error. One of White's problems is that the immediate £te3 is impossible because the e4-pawn would be hanging. Thus White would have to spend some time preparing £te3. By allowing White to play Jlg5 and Bxf6, Black not only lets White solve the problem of developing his bishop, and how each side tries to frustrate the other's plans. By looking at all these games in quick succession, you will notice connections and similarities be- tween them which would not be ap- parent if you looked at them over a period of months. When these posi- tions arise in your games, you will then have a much better idea of what you should be trying to do. Even grandmasters depend on this type of knowledge, and if they are thrown into unfamiliar territory, then they immediately start to play much less strongly. The following game is an illustration of this, but it also dem- onstrates a second valuable lesson: the importance of sticking consistently to a plan. M. Adams - A. Onishchuk Tilburg 1997 Two Knights Defence
1 e4 e5 2 £tf3 c6 3 Nc4 4 d3
Ne7 5 O-O O-O 6 a4 d6 7 Nbd2 Adams is playing this quiet system in a slightly unusual way. White nor- mally plays c3 at some stage, so as to preserve his c4-bishop from exchange (he can meet ...Na5 by Bb5, and then drop it back to a4 and c2 if Black chases it with his pawns). Adams has countered the threat of ...?)a5 in a dif- ferent way, by playing a4. This not only enables him to maintain the bishop on the a2-g8 diagonal, but may also form the basis of a space-gaining operation on the queenside. A third Ar THE BOARD 37 but also allows £te3 without loss of time. Already one can see the outlines of a good knight vs bad bishop position shaping up. Black should have played 10...h6. He need not worry about 11 Ng3 Bf8 12 £rf5, because the knight can be ex- pelled by 12..Ah7 followed by ...g6.
11 Ng5 h6
Having played ...Bf8, it would have been psychologically very difficult to return to e7, although that might have been the best choice. The move played ultimately turns out to weaken Black's kingside. 12 i.xf6 Rxf6 up with a concrete line in which a5 turned out to be a useful move, but he must look to the long term. Given that he is aiming for light-squared control, the possibility of a6, forcing ...b6, would be helpful. Black can, of course, prevent this by playing ...a6 himself, but this would not be without possible defects. White will at some stage play £ki5, and Black would like to be able to expel the knight with ...c6. If he has already played ...a6, then the knight can settle on b6. Thus Black is presented with a choice of evils, which never makes for an easy decision.
14... e7 15 Sa3
Another useful move. Once again, White is looking forward to the day when Black will have to play ...c6, leaving his d6-pawn weak. Now the rook can come to d3, stepping up the pressure against d6 without loss of time. The firepower could even be in- creased by Sel-e2-d2. Note that when one is lining up the heavy artillery along an open or half-open file, it is usually better to have the rooks in front of the queen. Here White can achieve this ideal formation very effi- ciently. Both these ideas (gaining a queen- side space advantage and developing the rook via a3) were already inherent in White's 6th move, so Adams's play has been very consistent.

Black will be two pawns down for nothing. There comes a point in the vast ma- jority of games when your acquired knowledge will be exhausted and you will have to rely on your own re- sources. This point normally arises in the early middlegame. The next step is to formulate a plan. You may already have some idea of the options avail- able from your opening study; this will help you to narrow your search. In any case, it is time for some serious thought; the plan you choose now will go a long way towards defining the whole shape of the struggle to come. In some positions, for example, those with a blocked centre, it may be ap- propriate to construct a long-term plan which may require ten or twenty moves to execute. More likely, your plan will be much shorter-range, lasting per- haps five moves. This applies particu- larly in relatively open positions. Here are some tips on making a plan: 1) Make sure your plan is benefi- cial. There is no point aiming for a tar- get which does not actually enhance your position. Typical misguided plans are: attacking on the wrong part of the board; aiming for the exchange of the wrong pieces; committing yourself to weakening pawn advances. 2) Make sure your plan is realistic. There is no point in embarking on a five-move plan if your opponent can wait for the first four moves, and then stop your plan by playing one move himself. 3) Make sure your plan is not tacti- cally flawed. Even if what you are aiming for is worthwhile, this will not help if your opponent can mate you while you are executing it. Having decided on a particular plan, you have to strike a balance be- tween consistency and flexibility. On the one hand, pointless changes of plan are very damaging. If you play two moves of one plan, then three moves of another, then four moves of a third, you will probably be back more or less where you started! The ideal situation occurs when you formulate a plan and, while you are executing it, your oppo- nent does little either to prevent it or to develop counterplay. Then you can produce an elegant positional game which is dominated by a single strate- gic thread. However, games like this normally only arise between players of very different strengths (the Adams- Onishchuk game above is an excep- tion in this respect). More often your plan will be blown off course because your opponent will interfere with it in some way. While consistency is a vir- tue, sometimes you have to be as prag- matic as a politician in changing your

plan. If your opponent has blocked Plan A, but at the cost of creating a weakness elsewhere on the board, it would be foolish to stick to your origi- nal intention, ignoring the new situa- tion. Instead you should rethink your strategy. Most games are like this: the players formulate a series of mini- plans and strike a balance between forwarding their own plans and inter- fering with those of the opponent. Eventually the balance is upset, either by one player's plan succeeding deci- sively, or by the game dissolving into tactics. J. Nunn - V. Hort Wijk aan Zee 1982 Giuoco Piano

Nb3 Na7 9 Sei Ne6 10 Nc4 h6 11 a4 White has adopted a quiet opening system which avoids an early d4 in the hope of playing it at a more effective moment later. While this system is very solid, it has the defect that if Black plays in equally solid style, the game may simply peter out to a draw. White's last move aims for a5, gain- ing space on the queenside and await- ing a more favourable moment for the thematic move £te3 (aiming at the squares d5 and f5). Readers will al- ready be familiar with this type of strategy from the Adams-Onishchuk game given above. The game has now deviated from known theory, so it is time for White to think about his long-term plan and im- mediate 'mini-plan'. Since the posi- tion is still fairly fluid, it is difficult to create any long-term plans; trying to anticipate what will happen more than a few moves ahead is fruitless, as too many things might happen to throw a plan off course. However, the mini- plan is much easier; as mentioned ear- lier, one of White's ideas in this open- ing is to play d4 in the middlegame, when it may be more awkward for Black. White cannot play d4 immedi- ately, as Black could take on b3 and then on d4, so 13 Bc2 is indicated. Then d4 will be a real inconvenience, as Black must meet the threatened fork by d4-d5.

A major concession by Black, giv- ing up his strong-point in the centre. 15 £}xd4 White could perhaps have played 15 cxd4, although it is more compli- cated after either 15...d5 16 e5 Ne4 (when 17 Nxd5 Nxf2 18 gxf6

15... xd4?!
After this White's advantage is safe. Black would have preferred not to make this exchange, but he was proba- bly worried about the pressure on b5. However, he could have made a bid for counterplay by 15...b4!?. 16 cxd4 c6 The first mini-plan is over and has achieved a definite success, but now it is time for the next. White has a per- manent advantage in his greater cen- tral control, if only he can maintain his 'two abreast' centre intact. Thus his next mini-plan should consist of con- solidation. The immediate problem is the e4-pawn; Black need only move his e6-bishop to attack it awkwardly. White cannot defend it by Rf3, be- cause the queen must defend the d- pawn. One solution is to play f3, but the weakening on the a7-gl diagonal is ugly, especially in view of the lurk- ing bishop on a7 - Black would have good chances for counterplay by means of a timely ...c5. 17 h3! The start of an alternative plan for supporting e4, based on W 1-g3. White first of all rules out the possibility of ..Bg4, which might be annoying once the e3-knight has moved away.
17...Qc7 18 £tfl Nd7 (D)
Now e4 is defended, and at first sight a natural continuation would be 19 ?)g3, further covering the central pawn and making a move towards Black's king. However, one should al- ways take into account the opponent's intentions and see if there is a possi- bility to frustrate them. Black's recent moves, removing the bishop from e6, suggest that he intends to play ...c5. After 19 g3 c5 20 d5 c4, for exam- ple, Black activates his queenside ma- jority while White, thanks to the bishop on a7, has trouble getting his own cen- tral majority moving. 19 b4! A very ambitious move, which is only justified because White's central structure is already secure. Now if

while all the white minor pieces are well placed to create threats on that side of the board. I decided simply to move my pieces towards Black's king by ?)g3 and Rf3. At this point White could think about a breakthrough by d5 or e5, or simply play gaining the two bishops. 22 £Q3 Sae8 23Qf3 h7 Black could have tried the tricky
23...a3, hoping for 24 Sxa3 d5!, but
White would just play 24 W5. The text-move takes the sting out of d5 or e5, so White goes for £tf5. 24 £tf5 Nxf5 25 Rxf5 (D) Black ever plays ...c5, White will re- ply bxc5 and d5, gaining a massive central majority. Moreover, the cl- bishop can now move to b2, setting up further latent threats against Black's kingside. In a sense, this move falls under the heading of 'consolidation', because it is mainly directed against the possibility of Black breaking up White's centre by ...c5.
19...bxa4
Black now threatens to attack the b4-pawn along the half-open file, and White's first priority is to defend it. The pawn on a4 can be recaptured later.
20 Nb2 Rb6 21 Nc3 He7
After 21...c5 White would ignore the hanging piece since 22 dxc5 dxc5
23 Bxf6 Rxf6 24 Qxd7 cxb4 is rather
messy. Instead he would continue with the thematic reply 22 bxc5 dxc5 23 d5, when the possible counterplay against f2 is not a serious worry, e.g. 23...c4 24 Rd2 (24 Se2? Nxe4! draws) 24...Sab8
25 Se2, and White is ready for e5.
After the text-move, White must create his next mini-plan. The centre is secured and Black cannot attack it with ...c5 or ...d5, the latter because the reply e5 would give White an auto- matic kingside attack. Black evidently intends to restrain White's centre by doubling rooks on the e-file, which leaves open the ques- tion as to how White should make progress. My eye was naturally at- tracted to Black's kingside; there is only a single knight defending it, Black's next move anticipates e5 by White.
25...Nf8
White now has the two bishops to show for his efforts, but the knight on f8 is an effective defender of the king- side and direct attacking attempts do not appear promising. White must take care, or else Black's latent pres- sure along the lines a7-gl and e8-el might be unleashed.
AT THE BOARD 43
I therefore decided to switch to the queenside, and build up against the a6-pawn. Note that this plan would not have been effective before as Black could simply have played ..Bc8.
26 Hxa4 e6 27 Sdl Nc7?!
Black decides to pre-empt White's attack on the a-pawn and hopes to oc- cupy a good square at b5, but now the knight is dangerously far away from the kingside. It would have been better to leave the knight on e6, ready to move to c7 or f8 as necessary.
28 Nb2
The immediate 28 e5 g6 is ineffec- tive as 29 Qf4 is met by 29...?)d5. Now, however, 29 e5 is a threat. Note how White has again changed his plan to utilize the circumstance that Black's knight has gone to the queenside.
28..."b5
Black does not want to be mated and, now that a6 is defended by the knight, he switches his queen to the kingside.
29 Rf3 Rg5
While in positional terms Black's plan is quite reasonable, it has a con- crete defect: the queen is short of squares.

Now Black is obliged to make a fur- ther concession. Note that the greedy

After 3O...Rg6 31 "c3 Nb6 32 Saal Black would not have a good an- swer to the threats of 33 Qxc6 and 33 e5. 31 e5 Now White has more advantages to point to: the e-pawn is no longer under pressure, and White can create threats along the bl-h7 diagonal. The imme- diate threat is 32 JLcl Qh4 33 g3 Rxh3 34 Af5.
31... e6?
Alarmed by the growing danger to his king, Hort, who was in severe time-trouble, decides to jettison his a- pawn in order to bring the knight over to the kingside. In many cases, if your pieces are tied down to defending a weak pawn, then letting the pawn go is a way to activate the pieces and de- velop counterplay (see page 136). In this case, however, it makes little dif- ference; the position remains more or less the same except that Black is a pawn down.

silient defence; after 32 g3 Se6 33

White has taken the pawn and met Black's attack on the b-pawn. Now he must turn to a mini-plan for exploiting his advantage.

The rea- son is that you are really interested in relative assessments and not absolute ones. If, for example, you know that move A is '0.2 pawns' better than move B, then you would prefer A to B - it doesn't matter whether A is 0.3 pawns better for you or 0.1 pawns worse for you, it is only the relative evaluation which matters. In practice, of course, this type of logic is hard to apply if there are many different continuations. If you have al- ternatives A, B, C, D and E then com- paring A with B, C with E, D with A and so on is going to lead to a logical conundrum rather than a decision. It is much simpler to make an absolute as- sessment that A is a bit better for White, B is equal, and so on, and then pick the move with highest value. It follows that the method of com- parison, as we call it, works best when there are very few options (three at 37 sn Ultra-cautious in time-trouble. 37 f4 38 gxf4 Rxf4+ is of course unsound after 39 hl, but I wanted to make really sure there were no com- plications!

Black is quite lost. In addition to the minus pawn, three of his four remain- ing pawns are weak and his king is ex- posed. The rest is easy and consists of

option of playing ...Rh4+ first. The only difference between these two lines is that in one White's g-pawn is on g2 and in the other on g3. There is no question that the additional move g3 helps Black. If White exchanges his b5-bishop on c6, then he will have less control of the light squares in any case; the weaknesses created by play- ing g3 would then be quite serious. It may well happen that White will change his mind and play the bishop back from b5, but in this case Black has gained time.

Whilst occasions in which one can consciously use the method of com- parison are not all that common, in some sense it is being used all the time. When one is thinking 'does that knight belong on c4 or g3?', this is really a comparison. There is no at- tempt to evaluate the consequences of these two alternatives in absolute Bd2 (D) terms; one is simply asking which is better. In this wider sense comparison is an important part of chess thinking. Making your opponent think Sometimes it is better to pass the re- sponsibility for a difficult decision on to your opponent. You may be con- templating, for example, the move ...h6 which allows a piece sacrifice Bxh6!?. You look at the sacrifice a lit- tle; it is a complete mess, extremely hard to evaluate. However, the alterna- tives to ...h6 are about equal. You may decide to play ...h6 without further thought, and put the responsibility of evaluating the sacrifice onto your

opponent - he will have to spend time coming to a definite conclusion in- stead of you. There is nothing more frustrating than thinking for half an hour, deciding that the sacrifice is not sound, playing ....h6 and meeting with the reply Sadi within 30 seconds. In- deed, there are many opponents who would use the logic that if you thought about the sacrifice for so long and still allowed it, then it must be unsound. Playing your move fairly quickly short-circuits this logic. Indeed, your opponent may wonder if you have even seen the sacrifice. Obviously, this type of logic can be overdone; it would be ridiculous to allow a sacrifice lead- ing to a clear-cut win. Moreover, if you were playing a dangerous attacking player, then provoking him to make a sacrifice is probably not a good idea. A 'making your opponent think' move usually works best if you are in a slightly inferior position. Then your opponent will be undecided about whether to continue positionally, in which case his advantage might prove insufficient for a win, or to enter the tactics, when, at the cost of some risk, he might end up with a larger advan- tage. If your opponent has a large ad- vantage to start with, then he will probably avoid tactics since he has good winning chances in any case. Here is an example (D). Black stands badly, mainly because of the miserable position of his bishop on g6. White intends to swap bishops on d6 and then play This will J. Nunn - S. Conquest Hastings 1996/7 increase the pressure on e6 to such as extent that ...f6 will never be possible, and it also removes any possibility of Black playing ... f6 and ...Bh5. He might, of course, play ...£tf6-e4, but the knight could be pushed away again by f3 and he would be left with the same problems. The only way Black can improve his position is to play ...f6, intending ...Bf7, or, if White is careless enough to allow it, ...e5.

Conquest played this very quickly, which is a good practical 'make your opponent think' decision. White can take the pawn by 18 Bxe6, but this in- volves pinning the bishop, which might have dire consequences. He can also take the pawn by 18 Bxd6 Qxd6 19 £}f4 Bf7 20 Nxe6, which is simi- larly complicated. Finally, White might decide to ignore the offered pawn and continue positionally, although in that

the consequences are not too serious, then you have an oversight; if the up- shot is catastrophic, then you have a blunder. Why do chess players blunder? Hu- man fallibility is obviously one rea- son, but the majority of blunders are not purely the result of chance. There are several factors that can greatly in- crease the probability of a blunder and if one is aware of these factors, then one can take particular care during these 'high-risk' periods. The most common cause of blun- dering is a previous oversight. Let us suppose that your opponent suddenly sacrifices a piece and that this sacri- fice comes as a complete surprise to you. A typical train of thought starts: "Oh, ****! I completely overlooked that. It looks strong; perhaps I will even have to resign. How could I have overlooked such a simple idea? How stupid. And I had such a winning posi- tion." Not very constructive. Making a serious oversight is a huge blow to one's self-confidence, it sends the mind into a whirl and turns the stom- ach upside down. Nobody's brain can function properly in such a state. The only real solution is to take the time necessary until one's mind and stom- ach have quietened down. The length of time this takes depends on one's personality and will-power, and of course how strong the opponent's move actually is! What is quite useless is to have a major bout of self- recrimination at the board - if your Black's counterplay has dried up, and it is White's turn to go on the of- fensive.

I hadn't realized that this move was possible, although in retrospect it is hard to imagine any other follow-up to Black's previous move. At once I saw that the position had become rather more murky than was really necessary and the knowledge that I had made a bit of a mess of it was the trigger for what followed. 17Qxe5 f6 18Qd4 (D) personality tends towards this, try to save it until the end of the game (by which time, hopefully, it may not be necessary). This is another reason why running short of time is a bad idea. If something unexpected happens, you do not have the possibility of a short 'time-out' to recover your composure. Here is an example of precisely the wrong reaction, taken from one of my own games. J. Nunn - D. Cox Norwich Junior International 1974 Sicilian, Pelikan I e4 c5 2 3 e6 3 d4 cxd4 4 Nxd4

Warning signals One of the most common reasons for blundering is failure to take warning signs into account. Tactics very rarely strike out of a blue sky. There is nor- mally some underlying weakness, visi- ble beforehand, which the tactic seeks to exploit. When you see such a poten- tial vulnerability, it pays to look very carefully for a possible tactic by the opponent exploiting this weakness. Once I played 100 games against Mike Cook at 10 minutes (for him) vs 5 minutes (for me). At that time Mike was about 2300 strength. About half- way through the series (which I even- tually won 88-12) he explained his disappointment: "I thought that I would see lots of advanced strategic concepts in these games but actually all I have learnt is
LPDO."
"LPDO?"
"Loose Pieces Drop Off." During the remaining games I saw what he meant. Most of the games were decided by relatively simple tac- tics involving undefended pieces, when the LP would duly DO. Now, whenever I see such a combi- nation (they occur quite often), I think
'LPDO'.
Looking at the diagram overleaf, the LP on h8 should have been a a clear two-pawn advantage, but about
18...Nc5. After 19 Rd2 Re7 Black has
some nasty threats, while White has fallen somewhat behind in develop- ment. In fact White should be able to retain the better position by 20 O-O-O!, but of course White no longer has the same clear-cut advantage as at move 15.
18...Sxc2!?
This is not a particularly good move, but it had a devastating effect on me because I had completely missed it. Having now overlooked two of my op- ponent's moves, I went into a panic. I saw horrible threats such as 19...Qa5 or 19...Nc6 followed by ...Bb4+ and quickly decided that I had to get my kingside pieces out as rapidly as possi- ble. I saw that after 19 Bd3 Nxd3+ 20 Rxd3 Ra5+ (or 20...Nb4+) I would have to play $tfl, but the resulting po- sition did not look too bad. My king could find safety after g3 and g2, freeing the other rook; in addition Black's d-pawn would be very weak. Unfortunately my brain had stopped functioning.
19 Nd3?? Nc5 0-1
I am sure almost all players have had this experience at one time or an- other - disorientation caused by one mistake immediately leading to a sec- ond, much more serious, error. A calm look at the position after 18...Hxc2 would have shown that White is still clearly better after 19 Be2 (threaten- ing 20 Bh5+ followed by O-O), for ex- ample 19...Sg8 20 Bh5+ *f8 21 O-O

and White won easily. White's queen had earlier moved from dl to c2, so this is also an exam- ple of overlooking a switchback (see page 57). We will consider two other warning signals, but virtually any tactical weak- ness can give the opponent a chance for a combination. Note that by 'tact- ical weakness' I do not mean isolated pawns, bad bishops and other such long-term weaknesses; these are 'stra- tegic weaknesses'. A tactical weak- ness is a short-term vulnerability such as an undefended piece, a potential pin or fork, or a trapped piece. Tactical weaknesses may exist only for a single move, so if your opponent creates one, you should look for a way to exploit it straight away. One of the most common errors amongst beginners is to allow an e-file pin of the queen, but even GMs can underestimate the significance of a queen + king line-up. What is surprising about this exam- ple is that the initial move of the com- bination is one of the most familiar tactical blows in the Sicilian. It seems that the idea of it being followed up by anything other than Bxb5+ or ?)xb5 just didn't occur to Black.

Ar THE BOARD 53 Indeed, these defects are so serious that this move falls into the 'has to work' category (see page 28). The po- tential e-file line-up and the fact that Black has committed himself so heav- ily are clear warning signals to which Seirawan did not pay sufficient atten- tion. 8 *f2!

Of course 8 f2 is a very unusual move and one can easily imagine how Seirawan came to overlook it. In Open Games, White does not normally vol- untarily deprive himself of the right to castle, and in most positions it would be a waste of time for Black to start analysing king moves to the second rank. How, then, can one expect to spot moves such as in advance? This really is the point of the warning signs - they tell you when to take time out to look for unusual tactical motifs, which might only be justified because you have a potential vulnerability in your position.

7...Re7?
This is an example of a major com- mitment. Black's aim is to inconven- ience White's knight; indeed, one's instant reaction is that White must play 8 Re2 to avoid losing the knight to ...f5. However, if it turns out that White is not seriously inconvenienced by the pin, then Black has done quite a lot of damage to his own position: the queen obstructs the development of Black's kingside, takes away the last flight square from the knight on g6 and sets Black up for an e-file pin.

consider it a possibility for his oppo- nent. However, an extra piece provides pretty good compensation for the two bishops! Curiously, a similar 'diagonal dis- aster' occurred in another game from the Open Group of the same event. Our final warning sign is the weak diagonal. Here is a vivid example: Ye Rongguang - L. van Wely Antwerp Crown Group 1997 The diagram position arose after 1 d4 2 3 g6 3 Ng5 Ng7 4 £bd2 O-O 5 e3 d6 6 Nc4 c5 7 c3 (D).

was the direct result of not taking ac- count of the danger sign 'trapped rook on a8'. Had he looked a little longer, Van Wely would surely have seen Bxf6.

We deal with the question of how to continue after you have made an over- sight under 'Defence' (see page 97). 'Hard-to-see' moves Another type of oversight is the sim- ple 'blind spot'. In this case it is not a question of a misjudgement, but of a move, either for oneself or for the op- ponent, simply not entering one's mind at all. This is usually because there is something odd about the move, so that it doesn't fit into any of the standard patterns. Here is a clear example. awkward situation. After the check on b5 Black will have to move his king, as
7...£ki7 loses to 8 e5. In the game
Black chose 6"..5xb8 7 Bb5+ e7 8 dxc5 and soon lost. Perhaps 6...Qxb8
7 Bb5+ Nd8 was slightly better, but in
any case Black's position is hardly en- viable. Here there were three factors that led to Black's oversight: failure to take into account the warning sign 'weakness along the b5-e8 diagonal', the anti-positional nature of Bxb8 and the soporific effect of White's unam- bitious opening. A similar motif occurred in the fol- lowing diagram after the moves 1 d4

Mestel London (Philips & Drew) 1982 It is Black to play; Mestel contin- ued 29...Sd5 and White's material ad- vantage eventually proved sufficient to win. However, Black could have
56 SECRETS OF PRACTICAL CHESS
forced instant resignation by 29...Sd2!, which either wins a rook or mates. Ad- mittedly, Mestel was somewhat short of time, but even so it is not hard to calculate this simple combination, provided that the idea crosses one's mind in the first place. When two line-moving pieces are facing each other, the options are usu- ally limited to exchanging, allowing the opponent to exchange, or moving the attacked piece away. It is very un- usual for the piece to move part of the way towards the enemy piece. The ex- ception is when there is a very juicy outpost somewhere on an open file, practically begging a piece to land on it. That was not the case here, so the winning move was a little hard to see. Nevertheless, it is surprising that Mes- tel did in fact play a move along the file, so he must have noticed that it was impossible for White to take the rook after such a move. Evidently the fact that the rook was undefended on d2 formed just enough of a mental block to cause the oversight. I call such moves along the line of attack (without capturing the attack- ing piece) collinear moves. They are even more difficult to spot when the attacked piece moves away from the attacking piece. Here is one example from opening theory: 1 e4 c5 2 Nf3 d6

"xb6+ 16 *hl (D) M. Tai - R. Fischer Curasao Candidates 1962 In this position White is aiming for the exchange of light-squared bishops. Then he will have certain potential advantages: pressure against the iso- lated a-pawn on an open file and the possibility of an eventual good knight vs bad bishop position with White's knight occupying d5 (for example, if White plays Sa2, then £ki2-c4-e3- d5). Fischer found a simple and ele- gant solution to Black's problems:
16..Bb5!. This collinear move leaves
White with three options: to leave the bishop on b5, to play Nxb5, or to play Bxb5. If White ignores the bishop, then Black's next move will be ...Bc6, both attacking the weak e4-pawn and supporting the thrust ...d5. To meet these threats White will be forced to play Bf3, but this is hardly the most active square for the bishop; Black would obtain good counterplay by ...a5-a4, when the b2-pawn is vulner- able. The second option, 17 xb5,
AT THE BOARD 57
and now 24...Bxc3 would have left Black a pawn up with a good position. In the later game Unzicker-Fischer, Varna Olympiad 1962, the German grandmaster chose 21 h3 but lost in only five more moves: 21...Bc8 22 Bfel h6 23 *h2 Ng5 24 g3? Ra7 25 *g2 Ba2 26*flBxc3 0-1. Fischer's handling of this game was very impressive. Switchbacks are another potential blind spot. If you have just moved a piece from A to B, the idea of moving it back from B to A can be hard to spot. The third type of move which is hard to spot is the 'hesitation move'. This arises when a piece can move from A to either B or C. You decide that it is bad to move it to C and play it to B instead. Next move it would be good to play it from B to C, but you don't consider it because this is pre- cisely the move that you rejected a few moments ago. Here is an example (D); Black has a fairly miserable posi- tion. He is a pawn down, his king is somewhat exposed and White has a passed d-pawn which bears constant observation. However, the opposite- coloured bishops make it very hard for White to win, and in addition Black came up with an excellent defensive idea:
1..J14!
Now 2 Nxh4 Rf4+ 3 i.g3 Rh6+ leads to perpetual check, so I tried ... 2d7Nxd7 swaps off the knight which White was hoping to put on d5 later, and moves the weak a-pawn off the open file. The result would be a near-certain draw in view of the opposite-coloured bish- ops, but this might be White's best op- tion. Fischer played 16...Bb5 in two games; both opponents chose the third option and the games continued 17 i.xb5 axb5 18 d5 xd5 19 Rxd5 Sa4! (a second collinear move, put- ting pressure on e4; if White takes, then his b-pawn will be in trouble) 20 c3 Qa6 (D). Not only does White have no ad- vantage, but he is even slightly worse. His queen looks impressive on d5, but actually it is the knight which should be there instead. The knight has no route to reach d5, and indeed after ...Bg5 it will be virtually immobilized. Black can improve his position by ...h6 and ...Bc8-c4, for example. The Tai game continued 21 Sadi Sc8 22 &cl b4 23 d3 bxc3 24 bxc3,

Black's best move. After 3...<Bh5 4 Bxh4! Black is more or less forced to play 4...<Nh6, but then White has an extra tempo. In fact, even this would only offer White marginal winning chances because he has nothing forced and the exchange of White's danger- ous d-pawn for the enemy h-pawn has clearly favoured Black.

My opponent appeared surprised by this move, which has the nasty threat of 5 Nf8+ Nh5 6 Qh8+ *g6 7 Qg7+ h5 8 Qh6#. It is quite hard to stop this threat, for example 4...Qg6 5 Nf4+ *h5 6 Rh8+, 4..>g5 5 Nf8+ *h5 6 Rh7+ and 4...W7 5 Nf4+ are no help. Based on these lines, Black con- cluded that there was no defence and so... 1-0 Filguth had overlooked the simple
4...<S>h5!, after which White has no
winning chances at all. The reason: he had rejected playing the king to h5 the previous move, but under the changed circumstances it had become the only saving possibility. As an aside, I am one of those play- ers who gets up from the board after almost every move (but even when walking around, I am still thinking hard about the position). However, af- ter playing Bd6 I stayed at the board. When players are completely win- ning, they often remain at the board in order to accept their opponent's resig- nation, and I suspect that Filguth thus interpreted my unusual immobility. In fact, of course, I was frantically trying to find a good reply to ... h5. I seem to be especially prone to overlooking 'hesitation' moves.

simple 19 Qb3+ would have been enormously strong. After 19...Qxb3 (or else White swaps queens and takes on d3) 20 axb3 Sd8 21 He3 White wins the pawn, after which Black doesn't have much to show for his two-pawn deficit. I didn't even consider 19 Qb3+ for the simple reason that I had rejected it the previous move. It didn't occur to me that the 'extra' tempo ...d3 is actu- ally very helpful to White, because it severely weakens Black's d-pawn and, unlike the line after 18 Qb3+, White has not weakened the d4-square by playing c3-c4. It is worth trying to pinpoint repeti- tive errors in one's own play. These days, with the availability of strong computer programs, finding tactical errors is quite easy. I always quickly run my games past Fritz - it is often quite shocking what turns up! Time-trouble The advice here is quite simple: don't get into time-trouble in the first place. This immediately raises the question: what constitutes time-trouble? Some people panic when they have ten min- utes left for ten moves, while others appear quite calm even when down to their last thirty seconds. I will propose a definition: time- trouble arises if you have less than one minute left per move. In my opinion this is the lower limit for guaranteeing J. Nunn - J. de la Villa Szirak Interzonal 1987 In this position White is a pawn up but has yet to develop his queenside pieces. Here I rejected 18 Rb3+ be- cause after 18... h8 19 Qxb6 axb6 it is quite hard for White to continue his development. 20 d3 is impossible be- cause of the pressure on c3, and 20 c4 is met by 20...d3! 21 Nxd3 Nd4 22 Sf 1 Bg4, which leaves White totally paralysed. Black could just continue with ...Sae8 and ...Be2, eventually winning the pawn on f2 and setting up possible mating threats along the h- file. I therefore played 18 Qc2! which, in addition to the attack on h7, threat- ens to bring the queenside pieces out by 19 d3 and 20 Bf4. Black responded with 18...d3!?, based on the tactical point 19 Jlxd3? Qxf2+!! 20 <Nxf2 Bd4-H- 21 e2 Bg4#.

60 SECRETS OF PRACTICAL CHESS
an acceptable standard of play. It is of course possible to play well even with less time than this, but you are really putting yourself in the hands of fate. If no unexpected problems arise, no shocks, no really tricky decisions, then you will probably survive more or less unscathed, but how can you be sure this is going to happen? Those who are addicted to time-trouble will show you the remarkable games they won despite extreme time shortage; they probably won't show you the much larger number which they lost because of the same time shortage. If you regularly run into time- trouble, according to this definition, then you are doing something wrong and it is almost certainly costing you points. The reasons for running short of time are many. Here is a selection of the most common: 1) Indecision. Probably the most common reason. If you spend a long time agonizing over decisions, then you will inevitably run short of time. The pragmatic approach I recommend in this book should help. If you find that, after lengthy thought, you usu- ally end up playing the move that you wanted to play straight away, then learn to trust your intuition more. 2) Worrying too much about very minor matters. There is no point think- ing for half an hour about a possible advantage or disadvantage of what a computer would call '0.1 of a pawn'. This almost certainly is not going to cost you a half-point. The piece you hang later during time-trouble proba- bly is. 3) Providing yourself with an ex- cuse. To those who do not suffer from this particular ailment, it probably sounds ridiculous, but it is surpris- ingly common. In these cases there is a (possibly subconscious) reluctance to admit that a loss is due to bad play; problems with the clock provide an al- ternative explanation. If you find your- self saying to people after a game 'I had a perfectly reasonable position until I ran into time-trouble' then you probably have this disease to some ex- tent. It really is an absurd attitude. The clock is just as much a part of the game as the board and pieces, and los- ing because of time-trouble is no dif- ferent to losing because of weak play - it's still a zero on the score-sheet. The only difference is that if you run very short of time you will almost certainly lose; if you play more quickly, you may lose because of weak play, but then again you may not. The best way to improve is to gain over-the-board experience and if your games just be- come a time-trouble mess, then you are probably not learning very much from them. If you have time-trouble problems, then in addition to the points men- tioned above, bear in mind the follow- ing tips: 1) Arrive for the game on time. The most obvious and simplest way of saving time!
AT THE BOARD 61
2) Don't spend a long time consid- ering which opening to play. If you have the luxury of knowing more than one opening, then you should think about this before the game. 3) Don't think about theoretical moves. Some players spend an inordi- nate length of time reaching a position with which they are already familiar. An extreme case was a game I played as White against Stohl in the Poisoned Pawn, an opening with which we were both very familiar. I played a line which was believed to lead to equality. He was so worried about the improve- ment he felt sure was coming that he thought carefully about each move, trying to spot the 'improvement' in ad- vance. By the time the improvement arrived, well into the ending, he had used 90 of his 120 minutes reaching a position he knew perfectly well. The 'improvement', when it finally came, was actually a rather modest affair, but thanks to Stohl's lack of time I won the game. 4) Don't use up time thinking about obviously forced moves. Your oppo- nent takes a piece; you suddenly no- tice that after your recapture he has a possibility that you hadn't noticed be- fore. Don't think - just take back. Thinking not only wastes time, it also alerts your opponent to the fact that there is something you are worried about. It he hasn't noticed it before, he probably will now! Of course, you should be sure that the recapture really is the only possibility, otherwise you might overlook a powerful zwischen- zug. 5) Chess is all about making deci- sions. Postponing a decision doesn't necessarily improve it. Try to get into the habit of asking yourself: is further thought actually going to beneficial? I won't give any advice about what to do if you are in time-trouble, since this situation shouldn't arise. If your opponent is in time-trouble, the main piece of advice is to stay calm. It is quite easy to become so ex- cited that you start bashing out moves as quickly as your opponent and thus make no use of your time advantage. You should also avoid thinking "I must try to win the game during his time-trouble" and then embark on some risky venture which you would never play under normal circum- stances. This is only justified if you have a very bad or losing position, and the time-trouble really is your only hope. Given a choice between a quiet continuation and an equally good sharp continuation, then by all means choose the sharp continuation, but an opponent in time-trouble is no justifi- cation for knowingly playing an infe- rior move. Players in time-trouble tend to spend most of their time analysing forcing, tactical continuations, so be especially careful not to allow a tacti- cal trick. Where strategy is concerned, they will probably decide on a 'default move' to play if your move carries no
62 SECRETS OF PRACTICAL CHESS
special threat. Very often this 'default move' will be part of a plan for trans- ferring a badly-placed piece to a better square. If they are deprived of any such obvious plan, then the result is usually confusion or a 'nothing' move. With any luck, you can use the moves before the time-control to gain a posi- tional advantage which will set you up nicely for next phase of the game. Laziness Laziness at the chessboard manifests itself in two ways. The first is when you have a complicated possibility, but decide not to analyse it on the grounds that it would be too much work. Note that is not the same as the 'DAUT' principle mentioned on page
21. That represents a conscious weigh-
ing of the balance between the time spent and the possibility of finding a better move. It comes into play most often when there is a perfectly ade- quate alternative which can be played with little calculation. Laziness, on the other hand, is a deliberate turning away from a move which may turn out to be very strong indeed. Losing a game because you have overlooked a move is one thing, but losing because you have spotted the correct move and could not be bothered to analyse it is quite another! A second, more understandable, form of laziness is when your oppo- nent has an irritating possibility. You have to consider this same possibility every move until you become fed up with it and spend a tempo ruling it out completely. The most common mani- festation of this form of laziness is preventing a possible check by the op- ponent. You have to calculate the check in every single line, and in the end you just pre-empt the check by moving your king. There are, of course, many situations in which such a move is per- fectly reasonable, but there are also many in which the loss of time is im- portant. Playing hl after O-O (or bl after O-O-O) may be just such a waste of time. When such a move is justifiable, it is normally because of a concrete reason rather than because it is annoying to have to do a bit more calculation. Here is an unusual example of lazi- ness: J. Nunn - Xie Jun Hastings 1996/7 In this position, it suddenly oc- curred to me that Black might play

21 Sa3.
Determination Of all the personal qualities which are important at the board, determination is probably the most significant. Some players, when confronted with an on- erous defensive task, such as defend- ing an inferior and long-drawn-out ending, suffer a crisis Of will-power. They see the gloom ahead of them, with only the distant prospect of at most half a point, and become despon- dent. The result is either a feeble resis- tance, or a decision to stake everything on a half-hearted swindle. When this is brushed aside, they feel that they can resign with good grace. Not sur- prisingly, this behaviour no recipe for success. Even very strong players can be- come so resigned to the prospect of in- evitable defeat that they do not notice when a saving opportunity is presented to them. Here are a couple of notable recent examples. The position overleaf is a simple technical win for White, and it is hard ...a3 as a pawn sacrifice at some stage. I started to calculate lines such as 21 exf4 22 Bxf4 a3 23 Sxa3 Sxa3 24 bxa3 and wondered if Black has enough compensation for the pawn. I decided that she does not, because White's d4 is annoying for Black, aiming at both c6 and f5. 1 started cal- culating more and more lines and in each I had to take into account the pos- sibility of ...a3. In the end I just be- came fed up with this, and decided to rule it out.
21 Sa3?
My reasoning was that since the rook is blocked in by both bishops and unlikely to move along the first rank, it might as well perform a useful task (preventing ...a3). Deep down I was aware that this move looks highly artificial; my 'logic' was really just a rationalization for an outbreak of lazi- ness. A more sensible piece of reasoning would have been to note that Black's queenside pawn majority will be very good in an ending, and so White must play for a decision in the middlegame. For the moment White need not worry about ...a3, since the bl -bishop will prevent the b-pawn promoting for sev- eral moves. Thus 21 f5 is correct, aiming to play Ng4 or h5 to eliminate the de- fensive knight. Since White's position in the diagram is not especially good, he should probably be happy with a sacrifice on h6 leading to perpetual check.

Both sides were simply acting out the final stages of a drama which had been decided in the opening, and they knew full well what the result of the game would be.

Black had been under pressure for some time and ended up in this rook ending a clear pawn down. 45 g4?I Both players seemed to believe that this position should be a clear-cut win for White, but in fact it is not so sim- ple. The move played is probably al- ready an inaccuracy. After 45 <Nf3 Se6 46 Hd8+ (Shirov comments that

The evaluation of endings with Q+A vs Q is a simple matter at home, because one only has to consult a computer- generated database. The oracle in- forms us that this one is indeed win- ning, but of course it is not so easy at the board. The general feeling amongst GMs is that endings with Q+gA vs Q (and the defending king cut off from the pawn) are almost impossible to de- fend in practice, even if some of them are drawn with perfect play (see page 150 for more details). Thus even with- out consulting the database, Shirov would have been aware that this end- ing offers White excellent winning prospects. In the specific position above it is quite easy to see that Black only has a few checks and then White can advance his pawn to the fifth rank (59...Qd6+ 60 *g7 Qd4+ 61 *f7 Qc4+ 62 f8 Qb4+ 63 g8), which would provide further evidence in fa- vour of assessing it as winning for White.

xf4 g5+ draws. 2) 50 h4 <Nxc6 51 f5 *d6 52 f6 *d7 53 *f3 <Ne6 54 *f4 *f7 55 <Ne5 *e8 56 *d5 *d7 57 <Nc5 <Ne8 and White cannot make progress, pro- vided Black meets Nc6 with ... d8. If the white king is on c5 or d5, then Black can play either ... e8 or ..,<£ 7. The fact that Black has this choice of moves means that these is no chance of White winning by somehow losing a move, because only after Nc6 is Black restricted to a unique square for his king.

What makes Timman's decision to resign so surprising is that he could have quite easily taken the pawn on c6 and waited to see Shirov's intention. Giving up so early is an indication of defeatism - he felt that the rook end- ing was dead lost and, since the king and pawn ending was a natural conse- quence of the rook ending, then that too must be lost. In these examples, both Short and Timman were paying scant attention to the position on the board and were heavily influenced by the preceding play- The lesson to be learnt from this is that while the game is in progress, you should be concentrating on the current position, regardless of what has hap- pened before. There are very few play- ers who have the technical skill to convert advantageous positions into a win without at some stage allowing the opponent a chance for counterplay. The defender's task is to maintain his concentration, so that when a possible saving opportunity arises, he does not overlook it. There is no point in play- ing on if all you are doing is going through the motions, waiting for the right moment at which to resign.
2 The Opening
Building a repertoire It would be nice to start the construc- tion of an opening repertoire from scratch, so that everything fits together neatly, and all transpositions are taken care of. However, most players don't have an elegant opening repertoire. They play a motley collection of open- ings which they have accumulated, more or less by chance, over the years. However, we will take the idealized situation of someone starting from square one (al, presumably). The first step is to think about your personal style. Do you prefer open, tactical positions or closed, strategic positions? Does an attack on your king make you nervous, or are you happy so long as you have a counter-attack? Do you prefer main lines, or some- thing slightly offbeat? Next, look at the various openings available, and see which ones fit in with your per- sonal style. For example, when choos- ing an opening with Black against 1 e4, you might make some notes along the following lines: l...c5: Open positions, tactical, at- tack and counter-attack. Schevenin- gen and Taimanov systems safer and less tactical than the Dragon, Najdorf and Pelikan.
1...c6: Solid positions, strategic,
safe king.
1...e6: Closed positions, strategic.
1...e5: Fairly solid, but can lead to
almost any type of position, depend- ing on the follow-up. Petroff the most solid option.
1...d6: Sharp positions. Attack and
counter-attack. However, White does have solid options.
1...d5: Slightly off-beat, fairly solid
but a little passive.
1...£rf6: Sharp positions. These
days considered slightly off-beat.
1... c6: Slightly off-beat. Need to
consider what to play after 2 Do the same with openings against 1 d4, flank openings and with White. Then you have to consider how all these fit together. If you choose the Pirc against 1 e4, it makes sense to consider the King's Indian against 1 d4. This is more flexible and will give you additional options later. For ex- ample, you may decide later that you would prefer not to allow the Samisch against the King's Indian. To this end you decide to meet 1 d4 with l...d6, and against 2 c4 you will play 2...e5. Many players who would quite like to play this system with Black are put off by two things: firstly, White can play 2 e4 and secondly White can play 2 Nf3
68 SECRETS OF PRACTICAL CHESS
(it is true that Black can meet 2 3 by
2..Bg4, but many regard this as some-
what better for White). However, be- cause your openings have been chosen to fit together, neither of these prob- lems will bother you. The Pirc is al- ready in your repertoire, and after 2 you can play 2...£tf6 and enter a King's Indian, but with the Samisch having been ruled out. Likewise, the Caro-Kann and the Slav fit together, and then you can an- swer 1 c4 by l...c6, without having to undertake any additional learning to cope with 2 e4. There is a temptation to choose some really unusual openings, because the amount of study required is much less. However, I would advise against this. Rarely played openings are usually rare precisely because they have some defect. Sooner or later your opponents will start to exploit this defect and then you will have to switch openings. If you choose another very unusual open- ing, the process will repeat itself. Af- ter a few years, you will have spent just as much effort as if you had cho- sen a mainstream opening in the first place, and you will have little to show for your efforts. This problem doesn't arise with a repertoire based on main lines. First of all, such lines, which have been tried and tested in thousands of grandmas- ter games, are unlikely to be 'busted' in the first place. The worst that usu- ally happens is that a small finesse leads to a minor reassessment of one line. Secondly, even if the worst hap- pens and a blockbuster novelty fin- ishes off a line, it is usually relatively easy to switch to another line within the same opening. Mainstream open- ings such as the Ruy Lopez or the Or- thodox Queen's Gambit are not merely single lines; they are massive com- plexes of different systems for both colours. Suppose, for example, you play the following line of the Chigorin Defence in the Closed Ruy Lopez: 1 e4 e5 2 f3 Nc6 3 ±b5 a6 4 ±a4 f6
5 O-O ±e7 6 Sei b5 7 i.b3 d6 8 c3 O-O
9 h3 a5 10 Nc2 c5 11 d4 Qc7 12
2fod2 cxd4 13 cxd4 i.d7 14 fiac8
15 Ne3 2>c6 16 d5 2fo4 17 ±bl a5 18
a3 Na6. Suddenly you see a game in this line which seems to cast doubt on Black's play. You need a replacement line, quickly. There is a wide range of possibilities to choose from; you could try 15...Sfe8 or, slightly earlier,
13... c6. Perhaps delaying the ex-
change on d4 and playing 12...Bd7 or
12... c6 might be an idea. All these
are viable lines, so there is no need to panic. They all lead to the same gen- eral type of position, so that the expe- rience you have gained with your former line will not be wasted The general principles governing play with these Chigorin Defence pawn struc- tures will be still be valid in your new line. Moreover, all the effort you have put into learning how to combat ear- lier deviations by White (Exchange Spanish, Lines with Qe2, etc.) will re- main valid. Instead of facing a major
THE OPENING 69
overhaul, only a minor modification will be necessary. Once you have chosen your open- ings, how best to study them? There is nothing better than a good book, which brings us on to our next topic. Using opening books These days there are books on virtu- ally every opening under the sun. Some are good, some are competent and some are bad. Unfortunately, it is often not easy to decide which is which. In choosing a good book, re- views are an obvious guide, but these are often not very helpful in the chess world. This is not necessarily the fault of the reviewers; I can testify from personal experience that reviewing openings books is a difficult and thankless task. In order to assess an opening book properly, you really have to be an expert in that particular opening. Of course, you can check to see if it is up-to-date and well-written, but a really good openings book will contain all those finesses which only a practitioner of the opening will know. Cunning move-orders designed to avoid particular lines, moves which caused a particular variation to be abandoned, but which were never ac- tually played in a game - only a spe- cialist will know whether such things are in the book or not. If one adds that chess book reviewers are normally un- paid (apart from receiving a free copy of the book), it is scarcely surprising that reviews of opening books tend to- wards a certain blandness. Major pub- lishers are perhaps slightly safer than smaller operations, since they nor- mally have some sort of quality con- trol; having said that, they are also under far more commercial pressure to bring a book out on time, which can lead to a rushed job. The saying 'Don't judge a book by its cover' is especially valid for chess books. The covers are normally made by designers rather than chess-players; of course they should be checked, but even so howl- ers occasionally slip through. In the end, the reputation of the author is probably the best guide to the quality of a book. Having chosen a book, it is best first of all to gain an overview of the opening. Look first at just the main lines to create a mental picture of the general structure of the opening. If the book contains illustrative games, it is worth playing these over first; you will probably already notice certain typical themes repeating themselves. In most major openings you will have a choice against each of the opponent's possi- bilities. As with the choice of the main openings, make a list of the various options and see which ones suit your style. Keep transpositional possibili- ties and move-orders in mind, to make sure that your opponent cannot cir- cumvent your proposed repertoire by a simple variation in move-order. Sup- pose, for example, that you are going to play a line of the Sicilian with 1 e4
70 SECRETS OF PRACTICAL CHESS
c5 2 Nf3 e6, and are thinking about how to meet the 2 c3 Sicilian. You no- tice that the defence 1 e4 c5 2 c3 d5 3 exd5 Rxd5 4 d4 2rf6 5 2rf3 Ng4 is currently popular, and decide to play that. It would be easy to overlook the fact that White can play 1 e4 c5 2 £}f3 e6 3 c3 instead. Of course you can still play 3...d5, but now the line with ...Bg4 is impossible. There are ways round this particular problem, but it is important to have something ready in advance, and not to be caught out over the board. Notice that so far there has been no detailed study. Everything has been careful planning - good groundwork and thoroughness is the secret of suc- cessful opening preparation. Once you have your repertoire mapped out, then you can study each line in detail. To begin with, only study the main lines - that will cope with 90% of your games, and you can easily fill in the unusual lines later. One important question is whether it is better to study an opening book that offers a pre-selected repertoire (often called 'Winning With ...', or a similar title), or one that offers a com- plete coverage of an opening. Cer- tainly both books have their place and the ideal situation is to have one of each type for a given opening. It is cer- tainly useful to have someone do much of the above-mentioned work for you, but nevertheless some lines in the proposed repertoire may not suit you, or developments since the book was published may throw doubt on some recommendations. In this case it is essential to have a source of alterna- tive possibilities. More serious players who have a chess database (see also page 166) may like to check this for recent devel- opments before playing a particular line. A database is also useful for see- ing which lines are currently popular, and therefore where one should be fo- cusing one's efforts. At first you may find that your re- sults with a new opening are disap- pointing. This is more likely with strategic openings than ones based on precise analysis. When I started play- ing the Sicilian Najdorf, my results were very good. This is an opening in which concrete knowledge of specific lines is very important. I had just stud- ied the opening in great detail, and so my knowledge was often better and more up-to-date than that of my oppo- nents. On the other hand, playing a strategic opening requires a positional understanding which is better learnt by experience than from books. It may be several games before you get up to speed with such an opening, but be persistent - your efforts will be re- warded in the end. Books on offbeat openings A particular genre of books which de- serves special attention is that dealing with dubious and rarely-played open- ings. As in all categories of opening
THE OPENING 71
books, there are good and bad exam- ples. Typically, such a book will claim that opening X is unjustly neglected, that recent games have shown X to be playable after all and that all sorts of hidden resources and novelties are re- vealed for the first time in the book. Unfortunately, 99% of the time the reasons X is rarely played are entirely justified, the 'recent games' turn out to be encounters of little value between unknown players, and the resources and novelties will only stand a few seconds' close examination. The tricks which authors can use to make open- ings such as X appear playable are many and varied, and are, of course, revealed for the first time in this book! It is hard to give details without concrete examples, so that means I will have to choose a couple of victims. In this particular genre there is a depress- ingly high proportion of poor books, and it would be easy to choose one of the really bad ones and have some fun. In fact I have chosen one of the better examples, Tony Kosten's The Latvian Gambit (B.T. Batsford, 1995). This book is unusual in that a strong grand- master has taken a look at a rarely played opening with a poor reputa- tion. Tony was certainly taking on a real challenge with this title! When it arrived, I was quite baffled as to how the author had managed to fill up 144 pages; I had thought a detailed refuta- tion would take 10 pages at most. I decided to use the book as a basis for a couple of hours' analysis on the Latvian (pages 72-76 are based on this analysis). It is, of course, very rarely played and I would not expect a GM to dare it, but this enhances its surprise value. It would certainly be embar- rassing to face it and plunge into deep thought on move three! Moreover, when a new book appears on an open- ing, it always encourages a few people to take it up, so the chances of meeting it were high enough to warrant devot- ing a little time to it. When I was a teenager, there were a couple of junior players who used the Latvian which, if you don't know al- ready, is characterized by the moves 1 e4 e5 2 W3 f5. For many players this opening offers a huge advantage: it provides a more or less complete de- fence to 1 e4. If you play a line of the Spanish, then you have to worry about various white systems in the Spanish, such as the Exchange Variation and early d3 lines, plus the Scotch and 3 Bc4 - quite a body of theory to study. Adopting the Latvian short-circuits all that; apart from the King's Gambit and a few other openings, you don't have to study anything else to meet 1 e4. The question is: can the Latvian be considered playable? The move 2...f5 has a dubious ap- pearance; it doesn't develop a piece and it weakens the diagonals h5-e8 and c4-g8, the latter being important if Black intends to castle kingside later. I always viewed 3 ?)xe5 as the most logical reply - Black should be pun- ished for not defending his e-pawn
72 SECRETS OF PRACTICAL CHESS
4 Nxc6 is another obvious move,
but after 4...dxc6 I felt that this was rather playing into Black's hands. All Black's minor pieces can immediately come into play, while White still has to move his d-pawn to bring his cl- bishop out. Moreover, White has no minor pieces on the kingside, and if White intends to castle on that side the deficiency might allow Black to work up an attack. Neither of these lines is particularly clear, but the point of this initial evaluation is not to assess each possibility rigorously, but simply to decide which move looks best based on general principles. If I had not found a possibility that really struck me as the most promising, then I would have gone round again for a second look at 4 Rh5+ and 4 Nxc6. However, at this moment I noticed a very tempting move: 4 d4!. This seemed to me to fit in best with the principle of rapid piece development in the opening. White creates a 'two- abreast' pawn centre and allows the cl -bishop to be developed without making any concession. The most ob- vious reply is 4...fxe4, but this just loses after 5 xc6 dxc6 6 Qh5+ and with 2...Nc6. I had scored well with this reply in my youth, so I decided to concentrate on it. My first surprise came when I ex- amined the list of contents. Chapter 6 dealt with (after 3 Nxe5) "3...£te6 and other third move alternatives for Black". I was stunned - 1 hadn't realized that
3...Nc6 was even vaguely possible. In
fact Tony justifiably dismisses the "other third move alternatives" but de- votes over nine pages to 3...Nc6 (D). My first reaction on seeing an unfa- miliar move in a book is not to look at the author's analysis, but to set the po- sition up on a board and decide what would be the most natural response.
6...g6 costs a rook, so Black must move
his king. Nor is 4...£rf6 possible, as 5 Nxc6 followed by 6 e5 gives White an extra pawn and a good position. Black can, of course, play 4...Nxe5 but after 5 dxe5 the pawn on e5 prevents ... f6 and Black's development is corre- spondingly awkward. If he tries to get the pawn back by 5...Re7, then 6 Rd4 I noticed that White could win the exchange by 4 Rh5+ g6 5 ?kg6
6 Rh4 hxg6 (6...Sg8!?) 7 Rxh8 Re7.
In return Black has a substantial lead in development. An assessment of this relatively complicated position would take some time, so bearing in mind DAUT I decided to look for something simpler.
THE OPENING 73
8...O-O loses to 9 Ac4+. At the very
least Black will have to make several more moves with his queen and fall hopelessly behind in development. In addition one must also take into ac- count: a) the dreadful positioning of the pawn on f5, which has no positive fea- tures at all and only weakens Black's position; b) the possibility of d5, forcing the c6-knight to retreat; and c) the plan of attacking c7 by c3- d5 (or b5), possibly coupled with Af4. Summing up, Black's position is probably just lost. There remained only one more point to be checked, viz. that Black could not exploit the temporarily active position of his queen by 6...Nb4. However, it would be a miracle if Black could get away with breaking the one remaining un- broken rule of opening play, that one should not repeatedly move the same pieces while leaving the rest of the army at home. The analysis, however, is fairly simple: 6...Nb4 7 O-O Qxc2 8 Qel Ae7 (8..>e4 9 Nc3 Re7 10 Qdl
11 Sei Ne4 12 a3 Nc6 13 Ad3 wins)
9 c3 W6 10 e5 (threatening 11
Adi) 10...f4 11 a3 Nc6 (1 l...d6 12 axb4 dxe5 13 dxe5 Ng4 14 £ki5 Ad8
15 e6 2tf6 16 Nxf4 O-O 17 Ad3 wins)
12 Ad3 Qb3 13 Nb5 Nxe5 14 dxe5
and Black's position collapses. Even this is presented in rather unneces- sary detail; Black's development is so dreadful that it would not be amiss to looks very unpleasant, threatening €)c3-d5. After five minutes I was still unable to see any playable line for Black against 4 d4, so I decided see what Kosten gave. His main lines are 4 Nxc6 and 4 Qh5+, with 4 d4 being relegated to a small note, which con- tinues "4...Qh4! 5 Ad3 fxe4 6 g3 Qh3
7 Axe4 W6" and ends up as "fine" for
Black. Well, 4...Qh4 was certainly a surprise! However, I remained uncon- vinced. Black has violated virtually every principle of opening play, mak- ing weakening pawn moves, giving up a pawn and now developing his queen before the other pieces - surely there had to be a way to gain a clear advan- tage at the very least? Suddenly, I had an idea. How about 5 W3 Rxe4+ 6 Ae2 (D)? The more I looked at this the more it appealed to me. White threatens sim- ply O-O and Bel. Black has insuffi- cient time to develop his kingside minor pieces and get castled, for ex- ample 6... f6 7 O-O Ae7 8 Sei and
74 SECRETS OF PRACTICAL CHESS
condemn his position without con- crete analysis. Having done away with 3...#te6, 1 turned my attention to the main line,
3...W6, again focusing my efforts on
the line I had played decades earlier, namely 4 c4 fxe4 5 c3. In those far-off days the main continuation was
5...Qg6, after which I racked up quite
a few wins with 6 d3 Jlb4 7 dxe4 Rxe4+ 8 £te3. Kosten considers this very good for White, and his main line is 5...Qf7, a move which was practi- cally unknown in 1970. 1 was aware of this move, and indeed had faced it once quite recently against Fritz in a man vs computer tournament. I won that game, but my handling of the opening was rather cautious due to lack of knowledge. Kosten's main line is 6 Ne3 c6! (D) (his exclamation mark). has an extra central pawn, and the po- sition of his queen will turn out to be quite useful if he castles kingside, as he will have instant pressure along the f-file. Indeed, it quickly becomes ap- parent that Black will have a fine game if he has a few tempi to complete his development. After ..Bd6, ...£te7 and ...O-O his king is safe, and the white knights are poorly placed. Black's central pawns prevent the knights from moving forwards and the knight on e3 blocks in the cl -bishop. A quick look at Kosten's analysis bears this out; in most lines White feels obliged to sac- rifice a piece by Nexd5 or c4 to dis- turb Black before he can castle. All these lines are very complicated so, invoking DAUT again, I decided to re- turn to the diagram position. I imme- diately wondered why White should not take the pawn on e4. After 7 Nxe4 d5 8 g5 Qf6 9 £rf3 I was again feel- ing confident about White's posi- tion. White has admittedly moved his knights several times, but Black can- not really boast about this, as so far the only piece he has moved is his queen. In terms of development, the two sides are roughly equal and White's posi- tion is without weaknesses - in fact, Black's compensation for the pawn is simply invisible. Kosten gives two lines: 9...Be6, aiming to castle queen- side, and 9...Bd6. Taking 9...Be6 first, Kosten's continuation is "10 d4 Nd7 11 Nd3 O-O-O (D) 12 c3 g5 13 O-O h5, not fearing 14 xd5?! Bxd5
15 Jlxg5 Qg7."
His principal variation runs 7 d3 exd3 8 Bxd3 d5. Of course, White has a substantial lead in development, but Black has some strategic assets. He

2) 13...g4 14 cxd5 cxd5 15 e5. 3) 13...dxc4 (relatively the best) 14 Nxc4 h6 (14...g4 15 £tfe5 Nxc4 16 xd7 Sxd7 17 Bxc4 is also very bad, for example 17...Hxd4 18 Rb3 #)e7
19 Be3) 15 Be3, to be followed by
some combination of Qa4, Hcl and We 5. Black is a pawn down for noth- ing. If Black plays some other 12th move, for example 12.. Bd6, White again plays 13 c4 and in this case mat- ters are even worse as ?)xc4 comes with gain of tempo. Kosten's other line is 9..Bd6, and here he gives 10 d4 W7 11 c4!, which is indeed White's strongest line. The continuation is 11...O-O 12 Qb3 Nh8!? (D) 13 Bd2!? dxc4 14 Nxc4 W17 15 O-O, which he assesses as favouring White (and therefore recommends
9..Be6 as above).
The point of 13 Bd2 is to prevent a check on b4, and therefore to threaten to win a pawn on d5. It is also possi- ble to play 13 Jle2 followed by O-O, when White would also threaten the This line shows a typical ploy used by those attempting to make a very du- bious line playable: the totally irrele- vant move. Nobody could criticize the natural developing moves 10 d4 and
11 Bd3, but what on earth is 12 c3 for?
The d4-pawn isn't attacked, it isn't likely to be attacked and White isn't freeing his f3-knight to move any- where. If White does nothing, then of course Black will eventually work up a serious attack on the kingside, but in opposite-side castling positions speed is of the essence. The correct plan for White is to play c2-c4 to develop coun- terplay in the centre and on the queen- side. Suppose White starts with the most obvious move, 12 O-O, and Black plays as in Kosten's line with 12...g5. White plays 13 c4 (D) and Black is already in a very bad way: 1) 13...Nd6 14Qa4*b8 15 c5&c7
16 b4 with an extra pawn and a very
strong attack. If Black plays 16...a6, White can either sacrifice on a6 imme- diately or prepare it by 17 Hbl.
76 SECRETS OF PRACTICAL CHESS
both honest and a strong player will have some doubts about the lines he is giving, and this often manifests itself in phrases which are the chess equiva- lent of a disclaimer in a contract. After "6...c6!" in the above line Kosten writes "Calmly leaving the e4-pawn to its fate; what exactly does Black obtain in return? Objectively, very little: just a slight lead in develop- ment and a lot of fun." Not exactly confidence-inspiring for Black, but of course having taken on the book he can hardly admit that the whole open- ing is just unsound. The publisher would doubtless not be amused by a manuscript consisting of a ten-page refutation! Similar key phrases are 'might appeal to a tactically-minded player', 'offers practical chances' and 'Black's position is no worse than in main-line openings such as the Ruy Lopez'. Depends which variation, I suppose! Less honest authors are entirely shameless about such matters. They recommend the most outrageously unsound lines without blushing even slightly. They would never play such lines themselves, of course. My second example is also a rela- tively high-quality product from a reli- able GM author, Winning With the Giuoco Piano and the Max Lange At- tack by Andrew Soltis (Chess Digest, 1992). Books with 'Winning With' in the title confer an extra responsibility on the author, in that the result of the d5-pawn, and would have achieved this purpose using only natural devel- oping moves. Therefore this line may be slightly more accurate. Once again, Black's compensation cannot be de- tected. The position resembles one from a normal opening such as the Petroff, except that Black's f-pawn has unaccountably dropped off the board. When looking through 'dubious opening' analysis, look out for the fol- lowing: 1) 'Nothing moves' by the oppo- nent (i.e. the one facing the dubious opening), which only waste time. 2) Lines in which the opponent pretends he is in the nineteenth cen- tury, co-operatively grabs all the ma- terial on offer and allows a brilliant finish. 3) Lines which are given without any assessment. 4) Secret code words. The fourth point perhaps requires some explanation. An author who is
THE OPENING 77
After 13...O-O 14 Nxh7 (D) Black can, of course, accept the sacrifice. author's research is pre-determined. If the author reaches page 100 and discovers that the opening he is rec- ommending is unsound, then he is un- likely to abandon the whole project. Of course, this probably won't happen if the opening chosen is a popular, main-line system. 'Winning With the Ruy Lopez' is an uncontroversial title; many top GMs regularly play the Ruy Lopez hoping to win. The problems start to arise when 'Winning With...' is combined with an offbeat and un- popular opening, such as the Giuoco Piano. You can be sure that if the es- tablished theory of the Giuoco Piano favoured White, then lots of GMs would play it, but of course it does not. The author is therefore undertaking to discover something new which over- turns the prevailing opinion. Then the crucial question is how convincing these new ideas are. The line of the Giuoco Piano rec- ommended in the above book runs 1 e4 e5 2 2Bf3 Nc6 3 Nc4 Nc5 4 c3 2rf6
5 d4 exd4 6 cxd4 Jlb4+ 7 Nc3 Nxe4 8
O-O Bxc3 9 d5 (this is called the M01- ler Attack) 9...Nf6 10 Eel e7 11 Bxe4 d6 12 Bg5 Jlxg5 13 xg5 and now there are basically two varia- tions. The old continuation is 13...O-O, when White replies 14 xh7. The more modem option, and the one which has really put people off the M011er At- tack, is 13...h6!, which leapt to promi- nence following Barczay-Portisch, Hungarian Ch 1968/9. Let's take these two lines in turn. Traditional theory has it that this is a forced draw. Soltis offers some new ideas in the extremely complex posi- tions which result but, taking DAUT into account, we will not look at these. In any case, I think many players would prefer to avoid 14...<Bxh7 if at all pos- sible; it has the defect that White can force perpetual check virtually at will, and of course a difficult defence in which a slight slip might be fatal is not to the taste of many players. The reasonable alternative to taking the knight is 14..Bf5, when the following moves are virtually forced: 15 Bh4 (15 Bxe7 Rxe7 16 xf8 Exf8 is en- tirely comfortable for Black) 15...Ee8 16Qh5&g6 17 Ed4 (D). Now Soltis gives 17...Ee5 18 f4 Nxf4! 19 Bxf4 Ng6 20 W3 *xh7 21 Bd3 "which is described as unclear by Harding and Botterill - a judgement that apparently has yet to be tested. However, it is not easy for Black to

situation. The first important point is that Soltis notices, as Botterill does not, that 21..Bxd3 loses Black's queen af- ter 22 Qh3+ *g8 23 Hh4. However, Soltis does not add that the position after 23...Rxh4 24 Rxh4 Hxd5 offers White essentially zero winning pros- pects. Soltis in fact mentions Black's best move, 21...Re7, but then gives 22 Rh3+ and stops (see point 3 above). After 22... gS (D) it is quite im- possible to see how White can even defend against the threat of doubling equalize. on the h-file, e.g. 21...Axd3 22 Rh3+! *g8 23 Hh4 or 21..>e7 22 Qh3+ (not 22 Sxf7? Sel+ 23 *f2 Rh4+). Black's best appears to be 21...<Ng8
22 Bxg6 fxg6 but 23 Hf1 retains an
edge." The Harding and Botterill book quoted is The Italian Game (B.T. Bats- ford, 1977). However, in the later book Open Gambits (B.T. Batsford, 1986), Botterill gives "20 Rf3 *xh7 21 Nd3 Bxd3 22 Qxd3+ Ng8 ... it is question- able whether White has enough for the pawn. However White can hold the balance with 20 Qh3 Qc8 (Vukovi6) 21 £tf6+ gxf6 and now: "a) 22 Rh4 f5 (intending ..>d8) retains tension, though I think Black is better. "b) Simply 22 "xc8+ Sxc8 23 Hxf6 is equal." What is the poor reader to make of all this? Soltis and Botterill give com- pletely different lines and offer differ- ent evaluations. I will try to clarify the

point 23...Sh5! 24 Sxh5 Nxh5 25 Qxh5 Re3+, while after 23 Bxg6 fxg6 Black will force exchanges by ei- ther ...Sel+ or ...Sf8, leaving White a pawn down. This brings us to another warning: 5) 'Winning With' authors display great ingenuity in finding resources for 'their' side, but often overlook even quite simple tactical defences for the 'other' side.
THE OPENING 79
Botterill's other line for White, 20 Qh3, can be met by 20...Qc8, although I would feel a bit queasy about allow- ing my kingside pawns to be broken up by W6+ and then blocking in my bishop by ...f5. 1 would prefer to play
20...Bh5!, which again depends on a
small tactical point: 21 W6+ Qxf6! (avoiding any damage to the kingside pawns) 22 Sxf6 Sxh3 23 Sxg6 Sh4! and Black reaches a four-rook ending with a clear extra pawn. White should prefer 21 Qb3 Nxh7 22 Qxb7, when
22...Qb8 reaches a more or less equal
ending, while 22...Sb8 23 Rxa7 Sxb2 is unclear, Black's more active pieces balancing the long-term danger posed by the passed a-pawn. The above analysis shows that after
17...Be5 18 f4 White has a draw at
most, but I will be fair and point out an improvement for White: by 18 Ng5! Qf6 19 W7+ *f8 20 Qh5 he can more or less force Black to accede to a repetition of moves by 20... g8. How- ever, going back one move, there is an interesting possibility for Black to play for an advantage: 17..Bc2! (D). The point of this is quite simple. Black clears the fifth rank for his rook and threatens (amongst other things)
18...Be5 19 "h3 Qe7, followed by
...Be8, with a winning position since White is completely hamstrung by the trapped knight on h7 and can hardly move a piece. The alternatives are: 1) 18 Sd2 loses to 18...£rf4 19 Rg4 Nxh7 20 Qxf4 Be4. 2) 18 Bg4 e5 19 Bh4 f6 20 Nb5 Bg6 wins material. 3) 18 Scl Se5 19 Rh3 Nf5 20 g4 Rh4! and again White loses material. 4) 18 f4 Re7 with a nasty check on e3 to come. 5) 18 g5 (relatively the best move) 18...W6 19 Rh7+ *f8 20 2tf3 Be4 with advantage to Black. Now we return to 13...h6!, which most players cite as the reason for re- jecting the M011er Attack. Soltis recognizes the importance of the line by devoting 16 pages of analy- sis to the position after 13...h6. The critical position arises after 14 Re2 hxg5 15 Sei Ne6 16 dxe6 f6 17 Be3
(D).
Soltis boldly states "This move, at- tributed to the Finnish correspondence player Juhani Sorri, rehabilitates the new M011er." We will take a look at two possibilities for Black, 17...c6 and
17...*f8.
After 17...c6 play proceeds 18 Bh3 Bxh3 19 gxh3 g6. Soltis surveys the

It seems to me that Black is virtually winning. After 17...Nf8, Soltis's main line runs 18 Nd3 <Ng8 19 Rc2 Sh6 20 Sg3, and ends with the rather weak comment that "White will now follow with either See3 and Sh3, or by preparations for f2-f4".

Defence and against the various other systems Black might employ in the Giuoco Piano. In fact your whole rep- ertoire is founded on one move, 20 Rd2, which has never been tested in practice and which is analysed for just over half a page. Then it suddenly turns out that there is something wrong with 20 Qd2. What do you do? It is no good switching to another line in the Giuoco Piano, as these have long been dismissed as offering White nothing. In fact, you may as well dust off your books on the Ruy Lopez.
3 The Middlegame
This is the part of the game in which it is hardest to set down rules and give good advice. For every rule one pro- poses, there will be so many excep- tions that the rule may be more misleading than helpful. Accordingly, we are going to deal more with the psychological side of the middlegame than with technical issues. Good positions Congratulations, you have the advan- tage! But what do you do next? The first step is to judge whether your ad- vantage is of a short-term or long-term nature. If it consists of better develop- ment or attacking chances, then it is probably short-term; if it is based on better pawn structure or superior minor pieces, then it is probably long-term. Many advantages, such as control of an open file, may be either short- or long-term depending on whether the opponent has a means of challenging the asset. This step will provide you with a clue as to whether you should be thinking of quick action to exploit your advantage before it disappears, or whether you can afford to manoeu- vre slowly, tidying up your position ready for further action. It is also important to take into ac- count your opponent's possibilities for counterplay. It is no good starting some leisurely manoeuvres if your op- ponent has a passed pawn thundering down the board. Only if both condi- tions are satisfied - a long-term advan- tage and a lack of counterplay - can you afford to indulge in luxuries such as improving your king position. How- ever, in this case you not only can take your time, you should do so. You may not be able to see a concrete reason why a particular 'tidying-up' move might be useful, but you lose nothing by playing it. T. Petrosian - W. Unzicker USSR - West Germany match, Hamburg 1960 White's absolute domination of the c-file and pressure against the vulner- able a5-pawn give him a long-term

Nevertheless, White still has to come up with a plan for improving his position. He decides that a kingside pawn advance is the best way to pro- ceed, but if played immediately this would expose his king. Petrosian there- fore decides to play his king to the se- cure refuge on a2 before proceeding with his kingside plan. Only a com- plete lack of counterplay could justify such an extravagant manoeuvre, but in this particular position White has ab- solutely no need to hurry. 29 ifl <±>g8 After 29...Sb8, White would make progress by 30 Sb6 Sd8 31 Scc6 Bc7

Nxb3 Sd6 54 f5! Sb6+ 55 *a2 1-0 One common error in prosecuting an advantage is to indulge in tactics for the sake of it. There is a general feeling that the ideal game is one in which you positionally outplay your opponent and then finish with a burst of scintillating tactics. In fact, the
84 SECRETS OF PRACTICAL CHESS
ideal game is one in which you win without allowing any unnecessary counter-chances. If you can win with a clear-cut combination, then that is the best way to eliminate counterplay, because the game is over! However, you should be really sure that your combination does work; it is quite easy to miscalculate complex tactics, and if there is an element of doubt then a purely strategic approach is proba- bly better. Even if your combination 'works' (i.e. is not tactically unsound) then you should also be sure that your advantage in the resulting position is greater than it is in the position before- hand. A common error is to play an elaborate tactical line gaining, for ex- ample, the exchange for a pawn, only to discover that there are fewer win- ning chances after the combination than before. In the following example White, with a strategically winning position, spotted a seductively beautiful combi- nation (D): This position is a Benoni gone hor- ribly wrong for Black. White's pieces are all actively placed and he has the two bishops, while Black's a8-rook is useless and his knights poorly placed. 19 e5! This is the thematic Benoni break- through, so it came as no surprise.
19...dxe5 20 d6
But this was unexpected. I had an- ticipated the natural 20 f5 when Black is probably just lost. White threatens to complete his blockade by ?)e4, J. Bellon - J. Nunn Zurich 1984 when a list of the threats shows just how awful Black's position is: d6, fxg6, Bg5, Bc4, g5. Consequently, Black would have to try 20...£rf6 (20...e4 21 fxg6 hxg6 22 d6 and 23 Bc4 wins), but 21 fxg6 hxg6 22 Bg5 e4 23 Heel is crushing.

and Black's position is tom to shreds. Bellon's move gave me a momen- tary glimmer of hope, but then I real- ized he intended 20...Qxd6 21 Qe4 Re7 22 f5 with the same type of posi- tion as after 20 f5. White, it is true, has given up a second pawn, but his knight has arrived on e4 with gain of tempo. A quick look convinced me that there was no real answer to the threats to f7 arising after fxg6, Bc4 and, if neces- sary, Ng5. However, there was obvi- ously nothing better than to take the pawn.

After 24 Bxa6 bxa6
25 Sxc5 (25 Nxc5 Nd3) 25...Sxc5 26
Bxc5 Nd3, for example, Black re- gains the pawn on b2 (White should avoid 27 b4? Nxc5 28 bxc5 Nd4+). In view of the doubled a-pawns, White would be effectively almost a pawn up, but the win would not be guaran- teed.

When you are desperate, it is some- times necessary to play ugly moves.

It is of course desirable to avoid revealing to your opponent that you have over- looked something, but in this case my body language must have broadcast the message far and wide. The question mark attached to this move is perhaps a little harsh, because White retains a winning position even after it. Yet from the practical point of view it is undoubtedly a mistake. 21 would have led to a position in which White's win would require only straightforward, obvious moves - he just has to take aim at f7 and Black will soon collapse. The move played alters the character of the position completely and presents both players with new problems to solve. White had noticed an attractive combination without tactical flaws and leading to a won position. He then

It is clear from this variation that White's queen sacrifice made the win considerably more difficult; instead of a clear-cut and straightforward posi- tional win, White now needs to calcu- late quite lengthy lines.

result of a process of elimination. If your position is objectively lost, the most important rule is 'Keep the game going'. This doesn't mean that you should play on for a long time in a resignable position; it means 'do not allow your opponent a simple forced win'. The longer you can force your opponent to work, the greater the chances he will eventually go wrong. In the diagram position, White would be looking for a knock-out blow and would probably reject lines in which he is 'only' a pawn up. Denying him a quick win will eventually cause frus- tration, a loss of objectivity and a pos- sible error. 26 £tf6+?! Once again this does not throw away the win, but a pragmatic player would have contented himself with the gain of a pawn by 26 b3. After
THE MIDDLEGAME 87

White decides to keep his bishops. Once again there was a tempting alter- native in 30 Bxc6 Sxc6 31 Se7 Qxf6

Nf8 35 Sxb7 (35 Hef7+ *e8 36 Sxb7 S8d7 offers Black fair drawing pros- pects), but after 35...h5 it is hard to say whether White's advantage will nec- essarily lead to a win.

The queenside pawn majority is Black's only hope of counterplay. 31 £dl! The correct plan; if the bishop can reach the b3-g8 diagonal (via f3 or g4) then Black will be mated.
31...b4 32 Bg4
The simple move 32 Bd2 would also have been very awkward. Black's queenside pawns aren't going any- where because pushing them would open the diagonals leading to Black's king. Thus White has time to play Bf3-d5 or Ba4 and exploit his great piece activity.
32...bxc3 33 Bxd7 cxb2 (D)
Black's first real glimmer of coun- terplay, and the decisive moment of the game.
34 Ne6+?
The earlier complications, coupled with White's fruitless search for a knock-out, had left him short of time. Just at the moment when he could have really used a few extra minutes, he was forced to move quickly and threw the win away. The complexity of the position is such that in my original notes (published, for exam- ple, in Informator) I gave two possible wins for White, only one of which works. I suppose I should be thankful that I got 50% correct! The first 'win' was 34 Bxc6 Bxc6
35 d7 and now 35...Scc8 36 dxc8Q+
Sxc8 37 Sf2 c3 38 Sc2, followed by Sbl. However, 35...<Bg7! draws after

38...5c3, but now that things are turn-
ing his way he decides to play for a win. If Black can take the d-pawn, then his own passed b-pawn will de- cide the game.
38 Be7+?
There are very few players who de- fend well when they have slipped from a winning position into an inferior one. It requires exceptional self-control to forget about what has gone before and just to concentrate on the current situation. White could still have held the game by 38 Bf2! Scl 39 Sef 1 with a dead draw after the exchange of b- and d-pawns. The move played is a re- flex action to preserve the d-pawn, but White should never have abandoned the first rank, except to attack the pawn on b2.
38...*h6 39 d7
In my Informator notes I gave 39 Sb7 as drawing, but in fact Black wins 40Nd3 White is almost without a reason- able move, for example 40 h4 Sf8 (this is Black's main threat) 41 Seel (41 Sfel Nc6 42 Se8 Bf7 wins the d- pawn) 41...2te2+ 42 <4>h2 Sd8 43 Nd3 Bxd7 44 Bxe2 Bxel 45 Bxel Be7, followed by ...Bxe2, with a winning rook and pawn ending. 4O... c2 41 Bxc2 0-1 After 41...Bxc2 42 Bbl Bcl+ 43 Bel Bxel+ 44 Bxel Bxd7, followed by ...Bb7, White's rook becomes im- mobilized on bl and Black has an easy win. Bad positions The first piece of advice is simple: don't give up hope. The history of chess is littered with won positions thrown away. Even world champions
THE MIDDLEGAME 89
have been known to do this, and it is much more common at lower levels. However, you should not just hope that your opponent is going to make a mistake - you have to help him to do so. Being determined to make the win as difficult as possible is the first step in the right direction. A stiff resistance is almost always unnerving for the side with the advantage - he may well have over-estimated the strength of his own position and be anticipating a quick finish. There are two basic strategies when confronted with a bad position. The first is to find some way to hang on, of- ten by liquidating to an endgame. The attacker may not fancy winning a long endgame a pawn up and so may un- wisely continue to seek a middlegame win. Even if he does go for the end- game, a sudden switch from tactical middlegame play to technical end- game play can often prove disorientat- ing. We call this the 'grim defence' response. The second strategy is to seek to gain the initiative, even at material cost, hoping to stir up complications and cause the opponent to go wrong. We call this the 'create confusion' re- sponse. The choice between these alterna- tives depends mainly on the position on the board, but other factors can en- ter the calculation. For example, if your opponent is short of time he may welcome simplification to an end- game, so in this case the 'create confusion' approach may be better. If you are aware of your opponent's style, then this might also affect your decision. One important point is that you should not change plans in mid- stream. If you have decided on 'grim defence' then you should not lose pa- tience and switch plans later unless your opponent carelessly allows you a chance to break out. 'Grim defences' most often fail because the defender creates unnecessary additional weak- nesses, opening the door to the oppo- nent's pieces. The whole point of 'grim defence' is to set up a solid posi- tion which your opponent has to work hard to break down; such positions do not lend themselves to the creation of active counterplay. If you decide to go for 'create con- fusion' then you should press the panic button sufficiently early to give yourself a reasonable chance of suc- cess. However, you should be sure that your position is really bad enough to warrant such drastic measures. In my experience, it is far more common to panic too early than too late. Here is an example of each type of strategy, in both cases in response to a stunning opening novelty. J. Nunn - W. Browne Gj0vik 1983 Sicilian, Najdorf

Nxf6 xf6 12 g5 d7 13 f5 Nc5 14 h4 b4 15 Nce2 In retrospect, one can say that White should choose something else round about here, for example the sacrifice 15fxe6!?.
15...e5 16 Nb3 (D)
though Browne failed to win the game, his novelty was voted the most impor- tant of the second half of 1983. As the similar vote in the first half of 1983 gave a lower score to the winner, it would be fair to say that the most stun- ning novelty played anywhere in the world during 1983 had just landed on my board. After I had recovered from the shock, I settled down to decide on the best reply. I saw that I could take the knight, which leads ultimately to a better ending for Black, or I could try
17 Bg2, which sacrifices a pawn for
not very impressive compensation. My choice was determined largely by practical factors. I realized that Browne would have analysed both these lines carefully at home, so this was cer- tainly a crucial decision. I had spent a great deal of time sitting at the board calculating these alternatives and so, unusually when facing Browne, I was far behind on the clock. In view of the time situation, I doubted my ability to find my way through continuing com- plications which Browne would have analysed at home. I therefore decided to go for the 'grim defence' option, when the many possibilities for both sides would inevitably mean leaving Browne's analysis within a few moves of entering the ending. Moreover, my lack of time would be a less relevant factor as the complications would be less intense. As an aside, there is very little you can do to prevent the occasional I was feeling quite happy with the opening. In previous games Black had invariably continued 16..Bb7, and I had analysed the resulting posi- tions and concluded that they favoured White.

I was dumbfounded when this move appeared on the board and for several minutes I just couldn't see the point of it. After 17 Qxe4 Nb7 18 Hd5, fol- lowed by Bg2 if necessary, everything seemed to be fine for White. Sooner or later Black would have to take on d5 when White would have complete domination of the light squares.

White an extra piece.
22 Nxd5 Sxh4! (D)
This move is the key point which it took me several minutes to see at move
16. The upshot is that Black gains a
rook and two pawns for two knights. In an ending, a rook and two pawns is worth more than two minor pieces at least 90% of the time. Two bishops may sometimes hold the balance, but two knights have almost no chance. 23Sgl! White must try to keep Black's bishop passive. The material situation would be the same after 23 Bxh4 Bxg5+ 24 Nc2 Bxh4 25 cxb4, but Black would have a far easier time. His bishop can emerge via f2, his fa- pawn is already passed and his king can obstruct White's queenside pawns by ...Nd7-c7.

A combination liquidating to a rook ending favourable for Black. How- ever, there is saying that 'all rook end- ings are drawn'. While this is clearly not intended literally, it contains a large element of truth. Rook endings are often tricky to judge, because in one position an extra pawn may be in- sufficient to win, while in another, one player may have a decisive advantage despite material equality. The reason for this is that piece activity is very im- portant in rook endings and can often prevent the exploitation of a material advantage. Likewise, if material is equal a difference in piece activity may decide the game.

had continued 13 exd5 exd5 14 jkf4 Rd8 15 a4 and here a draw was agreed. After 15...Nxa4 16 Hxa4 Ee8 Black's pieces are quite active and the rook on a4 is misplaced, factors that balance the slight weakness of the iso- lated d-pawn. 13 e5!I A complete shock for me. Objec- tively speaking, this move simply re- futes Black's opening strategy. I saw at once that after 13...Rxe5 14 Bf4 my queen would be in trouble, so I looked to see where I could move my knight. Unfortunately, Black's natural retreat
13...Rd7 loses a piece after 14 b4, so
Black would have to play 13...Ne8. However, then 14 f4 f5 15 exf6 (best; if White tries to play on the kingside with h3 and g4, then the knight on e8 might actually become useful with ...g6 and ...Ng7) 15... xf6 16 Nf3 gives White a clear positional advan- tage - the e6-pawn is weak and it is hard for Black to bring his c8-bishop into play. However, Black is by no means lost and this would be a reason- able attempt at a 'grim defence' strat- egy. In the late 1970s Plaskett was prone to time-trouble, and he had already thought a long time before playing 13 e5. Given the choice between a messy, complicated position and one in which he could increase the posi- tional pressure by straightforward moves, I would certainly have pre- ferred the former. I therefore decided to look again at the capture on e5 and White decided to go for the inferior ending. After placing as many diffi- culties as possible in Black's way, he was eventually rewarded with a slip allowing the half-point to be saved. The next game provides a real con- trast. J. Plaskett - J. Nunn Lambeth Open 1979 Sicilian, Najdorf

cxd4 5 Nxd4 a6 6 Ne2 &bd7 7 Ne3 Nc5 After the present game I gave up this line. The idea of playing the knight to c5 is to exert pressure on e4, but once White has played f3 this pressure is irrelevant, and then it is hard to see what the knight is doing on c5.

in the end I found the continuation played in the game.
13...Qxe5 14 Nf4 Rh5 15 g4 Rg6
I didn't spend long on the moves
15...Rh4 and 15...Qh3. It is quite easy
to refute the former: 15...Qh4 16 Bg3 Rh3 17 Hfel 2>e8 (17..."h6 18 g5)
18 Afl Rh6 19 Rxh6 gxh6 20 Nxd5
and Black's position is disgusting. Al- though it is quite hard to find a clear- cut refutation of 15...Qh3, there is lit- tle point in thinking about such moves. White can regain his pawn immedi- ately, and there is almost no chance that Black can survive with his queen stuck on h3 and none of his other pieces co-operating with it. Home analysis shows that 15...Qh3 16 Sf2 2te8 17 b4 2d7 18 Nxd5 Nd8 19 Ne3! is very strong; e.g. 19..Bf6 loses to 20 £fl Rh4 21 Ng3 Rg5 22 f4. 16 b4 This was the point of White's pawn sacrifice. The knight has to move, and then Bd3 traps the queen.
16..Ace4!
Except, of course, if it moves to e4! Black can avoid immediate material loss by 16...e5 17 Bxe5 Ne6, but after
18 Bd3 g5 19 "xg5 xg5 20 h4
£te6 21 W5 he has a very bad ending, for example 21...Bxb4 22 .xf6 gxf6 23 xd5 Bc5+ 24 &hl. This doesn't even qualify as a 'grim defence' ~ it is just very bad without any redeeming features. 17 fxe4 dxe4 (D) This continuation is Black's best practical chance, once he has decided on the 'create confusion' method. He has two pawns for the piece and, ow- ing to the attacks on b4 and g4, he is sure to gain a third pawn. This is not a coincidence, but results from the fact that White's tactical operation de- pended on the weakening pawn stabs b4 and g4. Given that Black obtains a material equivalent for the piece, you may wonder why he is worse. The an- swer is simply development. All the white pieces are in active play, while Black's queenside is still sitting at home. 18 *hl White decides to jettison the b4- pawn, preferring to keep the pawn on g4 which shields his king. After 18 Bg5 fid8 (18...Bxb4 is also possible) Black has sufficient play.

Sxd4 27 Bxa6 and now 27..Bxa6 28 Hxa6 Hd3 fails to 29 b7. A common error in wild games is to overlook a positional continuation. With the adrenaline pumping, and mates all around, it is easy to develop 'tunnel vision' that only sees tactical possibilities; then a calm liquidating line can easily be missed.

He has not simply been content to keep his material, which might have allowed Black to complete his development and create strong counterplay. Instead, he has kept his pieces active and not been afraid to calculate tactical lines.
19...b6!?
Following the confusion policy. White's last move demolished Black's hopes of activating his light-squared bishop on the c8-g4 diagonal, so now the idea is to develop it on the long di- agonal. The choice of ...b6 rather than ...b5 was based on two factors: firstly, in some lines Black plays ..Bc5 and then it is useful to have the bishop de- fended (see the game); secondly, the possibilities of axb6 and ...bxa5 give White more to think about.

£}g4 0-1 Defending well after having made an oversight requires especially cool nerves. We have previously discussed the possible causes of oversights and the warning signs which can indicate when danger is near. Suppose, despite this advice, you nevertheless overlook a surprising and strong move by your opponent. The first piece of advice is to stay calm. It is all too easy to bash out an instinctive response, either through uncontrollable nervous agita- tion or in an attempt to persuade your opponent that you had foreseen his move and had a reply ready. This is a mistake. The correct approach is to spend a few minutes just calming your nerves. Don't get caught up a mental loop of self-recrimination - you don't have time for this while you are at the board. Try to forget about the history of the position, and just consider the current state of affairs on the board. A calm look will very often show that your opponent's move is not nearly as strong as you feared at first and that there are still fighting chances. Then 27 d5?? A horrible blunder in extreme time- trouble - White plays for a mate which does not exist. Despite the downturn in his fortunes, if White had kept a clear head then he would probably have saved the game. The correct

you can choose one of the defensive techniques outlined above and con- tinue the struggle. Attack 'inviting everyone to the party' Most books dealing with attacks on the king discuss the various typical methods of breakthrough; sacrifice on h7, sacrifice on g7, double bishop sac- rifice, and so on. I will not deal with these, partly because they are dis- cussed at length in many other places, but also because they represent only the final stages of an attack. Most players can manage a double bishop sacrifice, provided that they first arrive at a position in which such a sacrifice is possible. The main factor governing the suc- cess of an attack on the enemy king is whether you can bring more attacking pieces to bear on his king position than he can muster for the defence. If you have a large local superiority of force, then a sacrificial breakthrough will of- ten arise as a matter of course. You still have to calculate that the sacrifice works, but the odds will be heavily in your favour if you have enough wood in the vicinity. This title of this section is Yasser Seirawan's catchy phrase for an im- portant attacking principle. Incorpo- rating every possible piece into an attack greatly increases its chance of success. If you have staked everything on your attack, there is no point hold- ing pieces in reserve, since the game will be decided before reserve pieces will be of any use. The following position is a classic example:
HAH
A. Nimzowitsch - S. Tarrasch St Petersburg 1914 Black already has a local superior- ity on the kingside, because White has no defensive pieces there at all. How- ever, 18...Qh4 is ineffective owing to
19 W3 and the kingside is shored up.

When you play Sel-e3-g3 or Qdl-el-h4, you are cre- ating the preconditions for the attack to break through. The opponent must counter these manoeuvres either de- fensively or by generating counterplay in another part of the board. In addition to bringing your own pieces to bear on the enemy king, it is also important to block the passage of enemy pieces to the threatened area. Sometimes a sacrifice is necessary. S.

A chain of pawns extending deep into enemy ter- ritory has the effect of cutting his posi- tion in half, and may in itself prove sufficient to prevent any pieces com- ing to the rescue of the beleaguered king. Then it is a matter of whittling away the defensive pieces on the side of the wedge near the king, by sacrifi- cial means if necessary. It is important to watch out for a counter-sacrifice breaking up the wedge, but otherwise such attacks are usually plain sailing. J. Nunn - A. Vydesiaver Leeuwarden Open 1995 I had earlier sacrificed my h-pawn in order to gain time for my attack. This had the positive effect of opening the h-file and allowing the f-pawn to advance, but on the other hand Black's

Pressing home an assault against the enemy king, sacrificing a couple of pieces and finally delivering mate is a great thrill ... provided it works. One of the great dangers of even a correct sacrificial attack is over-sac- rificing. It very often happens that the first sacrifice is sound, but then the player gets overwhelmed with the de- sire to finish 'brilliantly' and instead of just bringing up all his pieces and mating his opponent, he goes on a quite unnecessary sacrificial spree, endangering the win. As the material deficit increases, the opponent gains more and more chances to return some or all of the material in order to fend off the attack. Sometimes some quite unlikely-looking moves become pos- sible if there is enough spare wood to jettison. M. Botvinnik - V. Chekhover Moscow 1935

31 dxe5 fxe5. The position is still very complicated, but Black, a rook and a piece up, has plenty of possibilities to return some of the material. My own view is that White would be struggling to draw in these lines. White's minor pieces are ideally placed to attack Black's king, except for the knight on h3. The ugly cluster of black pieces on the queenside is not doing much and is certainly of little help in defending the kingside. White therefore decides, quite correctly, to sacrifice his one poorly placed piece in the interests of opening up Black's king position. 22 g5! hxg5 Black must accept, since otherwise he cannot defend f7. 23fxg5 N8d7 (D) After 23...&6d7 24 Nxf7, followed by Rh5, White has a crushing attack, so Black offers to return the piece. After the move played, White fin- ished nicely:

the game, but if there is no mate then queen and rook may have to grovel back to the centre, with great loss of time. The defender can often exploit the negative side of an attack by a suitable sacrifice to take the sting out of the on- slaught. G. Sax - M.

Be3 Rc7 9 f4 O-O 10 g4 Nc6 11 g5 Qd7 12 f5 de5 13 f6 Nd8 (D) Defence The principles for defending against an attack on the king are to some ex- tent the converse of those given above in the section on attack. The defender should try to move his own pieces across to help the endangered king while, if possible, obstructing the free passage of the opposing pieces to the critical sector. One particular motif which often arises in practice is that of the defen- sive sacrifice. The idea of the attacker sacrificing material is a familiar one, but it happens almost as often that the defender gives up material. Here I am not talking about the situation in which the attacker has sacrificed, and the defender is returning material, but about cases in which the defender is prepared to accept a genuine material deficit. The basis for such sacrifices very often lies in the positional concessions made by the attacker. In a Sicilian, it may be very useful for attacking pur- poses if White pushes his kingside pawns to g5 and f6, but if the attack collapses the white king may not ap- preciate having had his defensive pawn wall sent into the other half of the board. Launching an attack usu- ally involves a concession of some sort; it may be the creation of weak- nesses, as in the case of a pawn ad- vance, or it may be sending pieces off- side. If White plays his rook to h3 and queen to h4, then mate on h7 will end A typical Sicilian position. The white kingside pawns have launched them- selves forward, but in return Black has undisputed control of the square e5. 14 fxg7?! This looks like a mistake as there is no need for White to commit himself to this capture so early. Recently this

Stean's move may appear suicidal, but it turns out that White has prob- lems continuing his attack because his development is rather poor (all those pawn moves on the kingside). He really needs his queen on the kingside in order to create genuine threats, but both 15 Bd3 (intending Rh5) and 15 Wei drop a pawn after ...Qxd4 and ..Bxg5. Note that in the latter case Black justifies his play with a tactical point: 15 Wei ?}xd4 16 Bxd4 Bxg5

nerable. Thus White has to proceed with his attack much more slowly, but Black only needs to play ...b5 and ..Bb7 to set up a further awkward threat against the e4-pawn.
15 Rd2 b5! 16 g6?!
White decides to grab the exchange, but Black obtains tremendous com- pensation. It would have been better to try 16 a3 followed by, for example, doubling rooks on the f-file. However, I do not believe that Black has any problems as a major threat from White is still several moves away.

Finally, once he has played ... g7, ...Bb6 and ..Bb7, his rook can swing across to h8 and White's king will be the one subject to attack. In return for these many positional ad- vantages all White has to show is the very small material advantage of rook for bishop and pawn.

A fairly typical position for the 6 f4 Najdorf (the game started as a Dragon,

but later transposed into a Najdorf). White has attacking chances on the kingside, while Black can organize counterplay against the isolated e4- pawn. The long-term chances are with Black, because of his superior pawn structure, so the burden of proof lies with White. The normal plan of attack is based on Bh6 and g5, but this is not very effective here because White would be losing a tempo with his bishop and so Black would be able to meet 17 Bh6 by

Therefore this move is forced. If White's bishop were on h6 instead of e3, then he would have a standard at- tacking plan of g4 (preventing ...Nh5), followed by doubling rooks on the f- file, but as it is White always has to take ...h6 into account.

Again, there has been a remarkable transformation in the position. The only trace remaining of White's attack is the misplaced rook on h3. In return for the pawn, Black completely domi- nates the dark squares, while White's
THE MIDDLEGAME 109
pieces are doing little apart from de- fending the pawn on e4. Moreover, the advance g4 has seriously weakened White's kingside, and if Black man- ages to play ...f5 under favourable cir- cumstances then White will be in real trouble. An additional point is that Ljubo- jevid is an attacking player who does not adapt well to positions requiring careful defence; this game is a case in point.

White should be thinking about how he can draw, and his pieces are so pas- sive that the only realistic chance is to play £ki5 at some stage, returning the pawn to reach the haven of opposite- coloured bishops.

However, White must be careful be- cause Black threatens to defend h7 by ...bxc3 followed by ...Qxe4. The solu- tion appears simple: White must play his gl-rook to h4, so as to both defend h7 and cover e4. That is indeed what happened in one of the first games to reach this po- sition, Chandler-Yudasin, Minsk 1982, but after the further moves 18 Sg4 bxc3 19 Sh4 cxb2+ 20 Nxb2 White was shocked by 2O...Rxe4! 21 Sxe4 Nxe4 (D). Once again, if we compare the dia- grams then we can see the change that has taken place. Black's light-squared bishop is absolutely secure on the c2- g6 diagonal and while it is there White has no attacking chances on the king- side. Indeed, it is now White who has to think about defence, since c2 is very weak and Black can open further lines by advancing his a-pawn. The posi- tion is in fact favourable for Black and White was soon in trouble: 22 Ba3 This is a theoretical position from the Velimirovic Attack in the Sicilian.

4 The Endgame
King and Pawn endings King and pawn endings very often represent the final phase of a game. Of course, both sides may promote, in which case the players can look for- ward to a lot more fun, but the major- ity of &+A endings are decided in the pawn ending itself. Unlike most other types of position, the concept of an 'inaccuracy' is almost unknown in &+A endings. Given sufficient energy and skill, most positions are capable of being analysed to a definite conclu- sion. This means that errors can only occur in half-point jumps. Also, un- like other types of position, in which you may recover from a mistake and gradually fight your way back into the game, a slip in a &+A ending usually means the certain loss of half a point. This means that accuracy is at a special premium in this type of end- ing, so it is essential to be familiar with the main principles. There are three fundamental con- cepts in endings. Surprisingly, however, not even all GMs are famil- iar with their correct application. Opposition This is the most basic principle and has the widest application. The following Many games are decided in the end- game, especially between players of comparable strength. Mastery of the endgame is just as important as profi- ciency in the opening and middle- game. Even though this truth has been repeated over and over again, the end- game still remains a neglected area of chess study, especially amongst club players. In the past they had some excuse, as many club games were decided by ad- judication before the endgame was reached, but quickplay finishes are now the rule rather than the exception. In tournaments, too, the quickplay finish is the most common method of decid- ing long games. The practical effect is that players can no longer rely on an 'if I get an endgame, I'll work it out over the board' attitude. The fast time-limit implies that you have to know the correct method beforehand. Moreover, familiarity is very impor- tant. If you have to ransack your mem- ory for some half-forgotten but vital snippet of information, the chances are that you will have lost on time be- fore your memory cells release the necessary information. This chapter is therefore designed as a quick guide to what it is abso- lutely essential to know about the end- game.
THE ENDGAME 113
d5 Nb7, then White can win in two ways: 1) If White now heads for the g- pawn, he has gained a vital tempo: 4 *e5 *b6 5 *fS *c5 6 *xg5 <Nb4 7 f5 (S)xa4 8 g5 b4 9 g6 a4 10 g7 a3 llg8< It is worthwhile thinking for a moment about why moving one file to the queenside has actually gained a tempo in this line. The point is that af- ter 3 Nd5 the black king is not only unable to approach the a-pawn, but must actually move one square further away. Thus White loses one tempo but Black loses two. 2) 4 c5 (White mops up the a- pawn before heading for the kingside)
4...<Na6 5 *c6 Na7 6 <Nb5 <Nb7 7
xa5 Nc6 8 Nb4 b6 9 c4 with an easy win. If the black king heads the other way with 2...<Nd6, then White heads for the a-pawn, having gained an extra tempo because his king is one square nearer the queenside: 3 b5 e5 4 <4>xa5 <Nf4 5 <Nb4 <±>xg4 6 a5 <Nh3 7 a6 g4 8 a7 g3 9 a8W. This position is a technical win; if you are unfamiliar with the process, here it is: 9...g2 10 Rf3+ <4>h2 11 Rf2 *hl 12 Rh4+ *gl 13 *c3 *fl 14 "f4+ *e2 15 Rg3 <&fl 16 W3+ *gl 17 Rf4 *hl
18 Rh4+ *gl 19 *d2 *fl 20 Qel#.
The situation after l...Ne6 is virtu- ally symmetrical. Once again White must avoid the immediate dash for the pawn with 2 Nc5?. The correct method is 2 <Ne4 <Nf6 (2...4>d6 3 <Nf5 and White promotes first; Black's a-pawn position provides us with a clear-cut example. The two kings face ('oppose') each other with the minimum possible gap of one empty square between them. White has the advantage because his king is one square further advanced. This advantage is sufficient to win if Black is to move, because the black king has to move to one side or the other. This allows White's king to ad- vance to the fifth and run to one or other of the enemy pawns. In this situa- tion we say that 'White has the opposi- tion'. However, even in this relatively simple case there is still one finesse. After 1...&C6 White must not run di- rectly to the g-pawn with 2 <Ne5, be- cause after 2... c5 3 Nf5 b4 4 Nxg5 Nxa4 5 Nf5 Nb4 6 g5 a4 both sides promote at the same time and the position is a draw.

4...Ne6 5 *b5 *e5 6 *xa5 <±>f4 7
Nb5 (S)xg4 8 a5 Nh3, transposing to line 2 above. While the details of this position in- clude one or two subtle points, the basic principle is clear enough: when White has the opposition, Black must give way with his king and permit White's own king to advance. It is worth noting that if White is to move in the diagram, then Black has the op- position, but because of White's ini- tially more favourable king position, he can hold the draw: 1 Nc4 (1 e4 also draws, but any king retreat to the third rank loses, as Black can trans- pose into the above analysis with re- versed colours) 1...&C6 (after 1...&C5 both sides promote simultaneously) 2 <Nd4 and Black has nothing better than to return to d6. The situation becomes only a little more complicated when the kings are further back: With White to play, one's first im- pulse is to rush forward with the king by 1 c3?, but this is a mistake: Black replies l../4?c7! and after 2 c4 Nc6 or 2 Nd4 Nd6 Black gains the opposi- tion and White cannot make progress. The basic principle governing such cases of what is called the 'distant op- position' is that when the kings face each other with an odd number of squares in between, then the player to move loses the opposition. The situa- tion when there is just one square in between the kings (discussed above) is then just a special case of this rule. In the above position, it follows that
1 Nc2! is the correct move (1 <i?b3? is
also bad, since after l...Nd7! Black can meet 2 Nc4 by 2... c6 and 2 Nc3 by 2... c7). Black replies l...Nd8. Now 2 b3? can be met by 2...(S)d7, and of course 2 Nc7 and 2 d3? Nd7 give Black the opposition. The correct move is 2 Nd2!, again in ac- cordance with our 'odd-square' rule. At first sight White is not getting any- where, since if Black just keeps mov- ing his king up and down the first rank by 2...Ne8, White can apparently only follow suit on his second rank. However, White can make progress by carrying out what is called a 'by- pass'. This involves moving in the op- posite direction to Black's king and at the same time advancing. If it works, then the result will be to regain the op- position, but with the kings two squares closer together. White can re- peat the manoeuvre until there is just
THE ENDGAME 115
one square between the kings and then we have the situation discussed in the previous diagram. Here White exe- cutes a by-pass with 3 Nc3!. Now there is a direct threat to play 4 &C4 and 5 Nb5, so Black has to head for c6 by 3... d7. White continues 4 Nd3 and he has achieved his objective. Now the situation is simpler. 4... c7 and 4... e7 lose because White just heads for the g-pawn or the a-pawn respectively, so Black's king must ad- vance to third rank. White just op- poses the enemy king and gains the 'close' opposition, winning as in the previous diagram. Had Black played
2...Nc8, White would have by-passed
on the other side by 3 e3. When I first saw this idea as a very young player, one point really con- fused me. On most files White was content simply to maintain the opposi- tion but then, suddenly, on one par- ticular file White would abandon the opposition and perform a by-pass. How do you know on which file to execute the by-pass? Eventually I was able to answer my own question and in doing so gained a deeper understand- ing of king and pawn endings. In posi- tions dominated by the opposition, the attacker has two targets. In the above diagrams these are the pawns on a5 and g5. This is perfectly natural: the nature of the opposition is that if Black's king goes to the queenside, then White's king slips through to the kingside and vice versa. If there were no kingside target, then Black would lose nothing by allowing White's king to penetrate in that direction. Simi- larly there must be a queenside target or Black could safely move his king to the other side of the board. The by- pass manoeuvre is almost always per- formed on the file which is equidistant between the two targets. In the above case this is the d-file. In this position, which is superfi- cially similar to the above, White to play cannot win because there is no by-pass. White does win if he takes the opposition with his king on the fourth rank, but he cannot force this from the diagram. The critical position arises after 1 Nd2 Nd7 2 Nd3 and now Black must take care. 2...Nc6? 3 Nc4 and 2...Nd6? 3 <±'d4 allow White to gain the 'close' opposition, and in addition Black's king must also be ready to stop White lunging for the a- pawn. It follows that 2...&C7! is the only drawing move. This would be the ideal time for a by-pass, except that the e4-square, which White needs for
116 SECRETS OF PRACTICAL CHESS
the operation, is controlled by a black pawn. In the above examples, the 'two-tar- get' situation was quite obvious, be- cause the targets were far apart. Cases in which the targets are closer together are governed by the same principles, even if their nature is less transparent. White to play can draw, but only if he starts with the paradoxical move 1 &hl!. Other moves fail, for example 1 f1? (this loses because White cannot maintain the close opposition) l...<±>d2
2 f2 Nd3 (White would like play 3
Nf3, but his pawn is in the way) 3 Ng3 <Ne3 4 <Ng2 <Ne2 5 <Ng3 <Nf1 and Black reaches a target. Other first moves fail similarly: 1 h2 Nd2! (preparing the by-pass) 2 <Ngl (2 Ng2 Ne2) 2...<±>e3 (by-pass executed) 3 g2 Ne2 and wins, or 1 Ng3 <Nel 2 <Ng2 <Ne2. After 1 &hl ! Black cannot make progress, as White can always main- tain the opposition: 1) l...<Ne2 2 <Ng2 <Nd3 3 <Nh3! Ne3 4 <Ng3, etc. 2) 1...&C1 2 &gl ! (the only move)
2...<Nc2 (2...g4 is met by 3 g2!, but
not 3 fxg4? e4 4 Nf2 <Nd2 and Black wins) 3 <Ng2 <Nc3 4 <Ng3 <Nd3 5 <Nh3 and so on. We end this section on the opposi- tion with the usual warning that while general principles can provide excel- lent guidance, in the end it is the spe- cific position on the board that matters and a forced win overrides any other considerations. The following diagram is very simi- lar to the Neustadtl position given above. On this basis one might assume the position to be a draw, because after
1 f6 b6 or 1 <Ng6 a6 Black gains
the distant opposition. However, there is a slight difference because the kings are further apart than in the Neustadtl H. Neustadtl, 1890 In this position the target squares for Black are (obviously) f3 and (less obviously) fl . The latter is a target be- cause if Black's king reaches fl then White is losing no matter where his king is (within reason) or who is to play. For example, if White's king is on g3, then, with White to play, 1 Nh3 f2 2 Ng4 <Ng2 wins easily. If Black is to play then L. gl forces the same line. It follows that the opposition ma- noeuvres will take place along the ranks (because the ranks are at right angles to the line joining the two tar- gets) and that any by-passing will take place on the second rank.

point, because a new factor entered the equation. The Reti manoeuvre There is no better way to explain this idea than to give Roti's original exam- ple, even though it is one of the most famous endgame positions in chess history. A. Mandler Prager Presse 1929 position and this operates in White's favour. After 1 Nf6? b6 play pro- ceeds exactly as before, but with the kings on the g- and a-files a second factor enters the position: the possibil- ity of a breakthrough by c5. This only works if Black's king is on the back rank, so that White will promote with check. Moreover, Black's king must be on a8, because otherwise c5 can be met by ...&C7 (we saw this in line 2 of the previous diagram). Thus White can win by 1 Ng6! ?a6 (Black must main- tain the opposition; if he deviates, then White gains the opposition himself and wins by reaching d6 or d8 with his king) 2 Bg7! Na7 3 <4>g8! (3 < f8? *b8 4 c5 *c7!) 3...*a8 (Black is dragged to his doom; 3...<£ 8 4 Nf8,
3...*b7 4 Nf7 and 3...*b6 4 *f8 all
win for White, the last line being a by-pass) 4 c5 dxc5 5 e5 and promotes with check. In this case the logic of the opposition broke down past a certain R. Reti Kagan's Neueste Schachnachrichten 1921 White appears to be two tempi short of catching the h-pawn, but he never- theless manages to overhaul it by si- multaneously threatening to promote the c-pawn.

If you have not seen this position before, it is worth playing over the so- lution several times to see exactly why it works. Once again, the 'two-threat' concept is important, but this time it is not a question of tempo play, but the exploitation of the fact that a diagonal king move, if measured with a ruler, is longer than an equivalent horizontal or vertical one. In terms of catching the h-pawn, the routes Nh7-h6-h5 and Ng7-f6-e5 are identical. The advan- tage of the latter is that it activates a second threat, that of promoting the c-pawn. It takes Black two tempi to deal with this threat, by taking the c- pawn with his king, and this is exactly the time White needs to catch up with the h-pawn. Despite this coldly logical explana- tion, it is a remarkable idea and there still seems to be a whiff of magic about the position. The use of a second threat as a kind of warp-drive for White's king occurs in quite a wide range of situations. The above diagram is a second example in which White's king goes on a lengthy detour before catching the enemy pawn. In this case the white king is one tempo short of catching the h-pawn, for example 1 a6? c6 2 Nc8 Nb6 3 Nb8 <Nxa6 4 <Nc7 h5 and White is too late. However, by correctly exploiting the threat of promoting the a-pawn White can make up the time: 1 Nc8 ! <Nc6 2 <Nb8 <Nb5 3 <Nb7 (this is the key move; the white king just makes it into the square of the pawn) 3...<£ >xa5 4 Nc6 and White is in time. Triangulation If it were Black to play in the dia- gram then he would lose immediately, as White's king penetrates to b6 and takes the a-pawn. If it is White to move then his task is considerably harder. The key is a king manoeuvre L. ProkeS Sachove Umeni 1947
THE ENDGAME 119
which, by losing a tempo, transfers the move from White to Black. However, before starting this manoeuvre White has to play what is, in any case, a forced move: 1 Bd5. Now l...Nd8 2 Nd6 is a win even without the a-pawns, so
1...&C8 is forced. White cannot then
win with the direct 2 Nd6 Nd8 3 c7+ &C8 because 4 Nc6 is stalemate - he must be more subtle. While the white king remains adjacent to c5 Black's king cannot occupy c7, and so is re- stricted to shuffling back and forth along the first rank. If the white king moves around the triangle c4-d4-d5 the effect will be to transfer the move to Black: 2 <±>c4 <Nd8 3 <Nd4 <Nc8 4 Nd5 and now we have the position af- ter the first move, but with Black to play. White wins after 4...<Nd8 5 d6 or 4...&C7 5 <2?c5. White's triangulation worked be- cause of Black's lack of space; he could not emulate White's manoeuvre without stepping off the edge of the board. If you have looked at an advanced book on king and pawn endings, you will probably have noticed something called 'the theory of corresponding squares'. This is normally accompa- nied by diagrams with lots of little numbers (or letters, or sometimes both) on the squares. While this is an inter- esting subject from the theoretical point of view, to be quite honest it is of almost no practical value (not to men- tion that your opponent might object when you start adorning the board with mystic numbers). The opposi- tion, triangulation and a little bit of brain-power are all that are needed for the types of position that arise in over-the-board play. Of course there a few esoteric positions which cannot be solved by such straightforward techniques, but in all my career I have never seen such a position arise in practical play. The following position represents about the limit of complex- ity that one can anticipate over the board. N. Grigoriev K novoi armii, 1920 A position such as this would be an easy win for White if his king were on, say, d4, but here the win is difficult be- cause of Black's active king position. The first point to note is that after 1 d4? Ne4 2 Nc3 Black does not play
2...<Nd5?, when 3 (S)d3 forces the en-
emy king back, but 2...<S?f5!. If White moves anywhere except to d3, then Black just returns to e4, but after 3

Expect the unexpected Readers will have noticed several odd king manoeuvres in the preceding po- sitions. This is no coincidence; para- doxical king moves are quite common in king and pawn endings. It is very important to take into account the pos- sibility of 'unnatural' king moves, both for you and for your opponent. It is impossible to give rules for finding such moves, precisely because they are often 'one-off' events which only work in that precise position. How- ever, this won't prevent me from giv- ing a few entertaining examples. Shirov had headed for the position in the following diagram because it seems an obvious draw after, for ex- ample 1 Ng5 <Ng2 2 f4 <±>f3 3 f5 <Ne4. <Nd3 f4 White cannot make prog- ress, e.g. 4 Nd2 Ne4 5 Nc3 Nf5 !, etc. It becomes apparent that White would be much better off in the dia- gram position if it were Black to play. If Black's king goes anywhere except to f4, then White wins by 2 <Ne3 or 2 d4, while after l... <S>f4 White plays 2 <Ne2 and the black king is gradually forced back. In fact the win is still not too easy, but we will return to this point later as the first step is to work out how to lose a tempo. If White plays 1 c2, then Black must reply
1...<Bf4 (since l... <Be3 2 Nc3 loses at
once, and after other moves White wins by either <Nc3-d4 or 2 d4). Read- ers may now recognize a pattern emerg- ing: the situation is basically the same as in the previous diagram rotated through 90 degrees, with c3-e3 taking the place of c5-c7 and c2-f4 the place of d5-c8. Now the solution should be apparent. While the white king remains adjacent to c3, Black's king must re- main adjacent to e3; in other words Black can only oscillate between f3 and f4 (e2 and f2 are out because the d-pawn advances). White only has to triangulate c2-b2-b3-c2, all the time staying adjacent to c3, and he will lose a tempo. The solution runs 1 Nc2 <Nf4 2 <Nb2 <4>f3 (2...<Ne5 3 Nc3 Nd5 4 c2 <Ne5 5 &dl transposes) 3 Nb3 f4 4 c2 (unlike the previous dia- gram, there is still quite a lot of play left in the position) 4...Ne5 (the most resilient defence; 4... e3 5 Nc3 and
4... f3 5 Nd2 lose more quickly) 5
THE ENDGAME 121
I. Rogers - A. Shirov Groningen 1990 M. Hebden-G. Flear British Championship, Brighton 1980 However, after the surprising 1 g3! Shirov resigned. The threat is simply to push the pawn to f6 and then run with the king to take the f7-pawn, si- multaneously defending White's own pawn. Black can only try to extract his king from the box by 1..Agl 2 f4 f1
3 f5 Ne2, but White can keep Black's
king at bay: 4 <2?f4 f6 (or 4...<Nd3 5 <Ne5 and wins after 5...<Be3 6 f6 or
5...*c4 6 *f6) 5 Ne4! *f2 6 <Nd5.
The backward move of White's king is sufficiently counter-intuitive that even such a strong player as Shirov over- looked it. In Hebden-Flear, Black had been a pawn up for most of the game, but here he abandoned his winning attempts and played 1...5d5?!, at which point the players agreed to a draw. Indeed, after 2 Sxd5+ xd5 3 Nxf4 e6 there is clearly no point in continuing. However, as soon as the draw was agreed the players suddenly noticed that White could play 3 f5! (D) in- stead of 3 Nxf4. Suddenly Black is in trouble. After

play his king to g2 at move 8) 5 xg7 e7 6 xh6 <Nf6 is hopeless because White can extract his king by using up his one remaining tempo with the h-pawn: 7 (S)h7 Nf7 8 h6 Nf8 9 Ng6 *g8 10 *f5 *h7 11 *g5 followed by 12 *xf4. Having analysed both 3...<Bd4 and
3... d6 to a loss, one might be tempted
to assess the position as a win for White, but remember: 'Expect the Un- expected'. What does Black need to achieve in order to draw? First of all, he must be able to defend his g7-pawn if White plays Nxf4 followed by Nf5-g6. That means that his king must stay within three squares of f8. If White adopts his alternative plan of heading straight for g7 without both- ering about the f4-pawn, then Black has to be able to answer < ?xh6 with ...<S>xf3; one move slower and White will win as in the bracket given above. Since it takes three moves for White to reach h6, it follows that Black's king must stay within three squares of f3. The first criterion implies that Black must move to c5, c6 or d6 and the sec- ond implies that he must move to c4, d4 or c5. Luckily for Black, there is one square common to both these sets, namely c5. Thus 3,.. c5!! draws, e.g. 4 <Ng6 <Nd4, 4 <Nxf4 <Nd6 or 4 <Ne5 Nc6. It is quite hard to describe exactly what this motif depends on - it cer- tainly has nothing to do with the oppo- sition. Perhaps it is closest to the Reti manoeuvre, in that Black's king is trying to fulfil two tasks at the same time. Chess is more than counting One technique applicable in king and pawn endings, which is often recom- mended in textbooks, is that of 'coun- ting'. This name refers to the method of working out how many moves both sides will take to promote a pawn. Of course, this is only useful in 'race' situations, where each king marches into the opposing pawn-mass with the aim of creating a passed pawn as quickly as possible. I strongly advise against using the technique of 'counting'. There are several flaws with this method, and its unrestricted applica- tion can result in dreadful blunders. The main problem is that this method cannot detect any of the finesses which make king and pawn endings so inter- esting and which arise quite often in practice. The first cause of confusion is that you have to take account of who moves first. If White takes seven moves to promote and Black eight, when White promotes does Black reply by promot- ing or by pushing his pawn to the sev- enth? The answer is that it depends on who moves first. In the heat of battle it is quite easy to get this wrong and be 'out by one' (computer programmers know all about being 'out by one'). The second cause is that the count- ing method gives you no clue as to the

Nc4 it is all over. White captures the black pawns on f4, h4, and g3 while Black takes the a4-pawn and walks back to the kingside." Lasker does not consider what hap- pens if Black plays 2...<i>d4. By count- ing (carefully!) one quickly finds that Black's g-pawn is still on the sixth when White queens and, moreover, it is White's turn to move - enough rea- son to abandon the position as lost, if one does not take the trouble to visual- ize the resulting position. If we actually play over the moves
2...*d4 3 a5 Ne3 4 a6 <±>f2 5 a7 *xg2
6 a8Q h2 (D), then we arrive at the following diagram: relative whereabouts of the pieces at the end of the race. White may pro- mote and give check, or promote on h8 and stop Black's promotion on al. These things are obvious if you run the variation through in your head, but are not obvious if you are just counting. The simple fact is that you actually have to calculate the variation to make sure that one of these special situa- tions doesn't arise at the end of the race and if you are going to do that, then you may as well not waste time on counting. I will quote a position taken from Chess: The Complete Self-Tutor by Edward Lasker (it appears in all edi- tions before 1997), a popular chess primer which advocates the use of the counting method. It only takes a few moments to real- ize that this is a special situation. The congested mass of kingside pawns prevents White from pinning the g- pawn diagonally and from giving check on the h-file. In fact the g-pawn is unstoppable and the best White can do is to grab as many kingside pawns as he can, hoping for a favourable Lasker writes "In the position reached, the sequence 1 b4+ axb4+ 2 b3 forces Black to leave his pawn unprotected, giving White a passed pawn.

move to b6. There is far more to king and pawn endings than counting, and if you use this method you are asking for trouble. Rook endings Rook endings are the most common type of ending to occur in practical play. The reason is that if there are no open files, a relatively frequent occur- rence, then exchanges of rooks are rather unlikely. Minor pieces and queens can be exchanged far more readily. The ability to play rook and pawn endings well is a great distin- guishing feature between a master player and a club player. In simultane- ous displays, it is noticeable how the club players routinely lose completely equal rook endings, and how easily the master manages to escape with a draw from lost rook endings. Part of the reason for this is that rook and pawn endings are genuinely complicated, with a great deal of the- ory. Experience is perhaps even more important; the master will probably have encountered many rook endings in the course of his career, the club player far fewer. However, the situa- tion for club players is certainly far from hopeless; indeed, this is one of those areas in which a few hours' study can provide great dividends. We start with the ending of rook + pawn against rook, which is fundamental to all rook endings. queen ending. However, even this hope is in vain: after 7 Qb8 (7 Rh8 g2 8 "xh4 gl" 9 Rxf4+ "g3 10 Rxf5 "xh3 11 Rg4!? Qg3 and 12...*g2 is also a draw) 7...g2 8 Rxf4+ hl 9 Rxf5 glW the ending is a sure draw. Finally, if you don't calculate the whole variation, how can you be sure that the moves you are intending to play are actually possible? Here is a simple example. W. Schlage - C. Ahues Berlin 1921 It takes White five moves to take on a7 and it takes Black five moves to reach c7, so Black can meet <Nxa7 by ...Nc7 and the position is a draw. This was borne out by the game, which duly finished 1 e6 Nc3 2 Nd6 d4 3 <4>c6 <±>e5 4 <Nb7 <4>d6 5 <±>xa7 <±>c7 V2-V2. Right? Wrong! If White had played 2 d5 ! then he could still take on a7 in five moves, but Black would take longer as the moves he wants to play are illegal, for example after
THE ENDGAME 125
Rook and Pawn vs Rook This ending is sufficiently complex that your author was able write a 320- page book solely about this material balance (and even then several inter- esting positions had to be omitted!). However, many average tournament players have not studied even the fun- damentals of this ending. In fact, a few basic principles can be quite effective in improving one's rook endgame technique. If the defender's king can occupy the pawn's queening square, then the ending is almost always a draw. The only exception is when the pawn is al- ready far advanced and the defender's pieces are badly placed. The general drawing technique is quite simple and is called the 'third-rank defence'. fifth rank. Nevertheless, the position is completely drawn because Black has positioned his rook on his third rank, thereby preventing the immediate ad- vance of the white king. The only way in which White can get his king to the sixth is to play 1 e6, but then Black switches plans and plays l...Sbl, pre- paring to bombard the white king with checks from behind. Now that the pawn is on e6, there is no hiding place for the king, and after 2 f6 Sfl+ 3 e5 Sel+ 4 <Nd6 Sdl+, etc., the posi- tion is clearly drawn. If, in the diagram position, White waits with 1 Ha7 then Black does likewise by either l...Sc6 or l...Sh6. The second important principle is that of 'checking distance'. If the white king has no way to hide from a check- ing black rook, then the factor deter- mining whether the checks are a minor nuisance or a serious problem is the distance between the king and the rook. The further apart they are, the better it is for the side with the rook. Here is a typical position. White ap- pears to have made quite a lot of prog- ress. His rook is cutting the enemy king off on the back rank and his king and pawn have advanced as far as the
126 SECRETS OF PRACTICAL CHESS
try 4 Hf8 (4 Ne6 Ng7! and 4 Ha5 Ng8 do not help White) intending 5 e7, followed by 6 f6. If Black keeps his rook in its current position then he will eventually lose, but Black can change direction by 4...Eal!. If White now plays a king move to free his pawn, then Black starts checking from the side. There is no shelter, so in view of the large checking distance White cannot effectively meet the barrage of checks. White can, of course, play other moves but they do not help, for example after 5 He8 (to meet 5...Sa6+ by 6 Se6) the simplest draw is to re- turn to fl with the rook. On the other hand, 2...Ne8? loses. After 3 Ha8+ <Nd7 4 Hf8, there is noth- ing Black can do to prevent White playing 5 Ng7 (or f7, if the rook leaves the f-file), followed by f6, and there is no way to stop the pawn. Black's problem is that he lacks the lateral checks which saved him after
2...Ng8. There is no space for his rook
on the kingside, and he cannot give checks from the queenside because his own king gets in the way. This principle is usually formulated as 'move the king to the short side' in order to leave the other side free for long-range rook checks, but in the end it all comes down to ensuring adequate checking distance. Here is another example (D): Black is to play, and he faces the threat of Nc4 followed by b5. If he plays l...Sh5, then White advances his pawn by 2 Na4. The only possibility The above example makes this clear. If it is White to play then he should continue 1 Ng6, which creates the most awkward problems for Black. If White waits, then Black sets up the third-rank defence by ...Eb6. 1 f6 Hb6+ leads to the same thing, while 1 f6 Sgl+ is an immediate draw (note the large checking distance). After 1 Ng6 it is easy for Black to go wrong, for example the passive line l...Sb8 2 f6 *g8 fails to 3 Hg7+ <Nf8 (or 3... h8 4 Hh7+ *g8 5 f7+) 4 Sh7 and White's plan of 'switching to the other side' leaves Black defenceless. Note that this line would be a draw if White's pawn were on g6 and his king on h6, because there would be no room to switch to the other side. This leads us to the important conclusion that in the type of position in which Black has been forced to defend pas- sively with his rook on the first rank, the result is a draw with an a-, b-, g- or h-pawn, but lost with a pawn on one of the other four files. Here we have an f-pawn so this de- fensive plan is not good enough for Black. Instead, he should play l...Efl. This ensures that after 2 Ha8+ Ne7 White cannot play 3 f6+. White can only make progress by playing 2 Nf6, which threatens mate. Black has to choose between 2...<S>e8 and 2...<Bg8. One move loses and the other draws.

We already saw in the analysis on page 126 how the defender must be prepared to use his rook flexibly and operate from different directions ac- cording to changing circumstances. Here is another, very important, exam- ple of this: to defend is to retreat the rook along the b-file, so then when the white king moves to a4 or c4, Black can start checking. In order for this to work, Black needs to have the maximum possible checking distance and in fact l...Sb8! is the only move to draw. Af- ter 2 Sd4 (2 *c4 Hc8+ 3 *b5 Sb8+

White cannot make progress. If White plays a7 at any stage, Black replies ...Sa6 followed by ...Sal, and if the white king then approaches the pawn, Black draws by checking the king from behind (the nook on a7 is no longer available). This double change of di- rection (al to f6 and then back to al) is quite hard to see, and in fact it was not discovered until 1924 by Vancura. Several years ago I was asked to check some rook ending analysis, but I couldn't understand any of it - White, who had the advantage, seemed to be forcing Black to reach a drawn posi- tion, which Black then avoided! Fi- nally, I looked at the date of the analysis -1912 - and realized that be- cause the Vancura draw wasn't known at that time, all positions of the type shown in the previous diagram were thought to be winning for White. Not surprisingly, this led to some odd moves. I should add that if White's king is nearer to the a-pawn in the above The extra Pawn One of the most common endgame situations in practical play is a rook and pawn ending with an extra pawn on one side of the board, and the posi- tion otherwise symmetrical. Here is a typical situation: An ability to win positions such as this is fundamental to successful chess. White may have won a pawn with a combination, or perhaps Black had an isolated e-pawn which White picked up with subtle strategic play - what- ever your chess style, situations in which you win a pawn for essentially no compensation are very common. The question then arises: how often do you convert the resulting positions into a full point?
THE ENDGAME 129
I showed this position to some of the world's leading grandmasters, in- cluding Karpov, Kramnik and Anders- son, and asked them to estimate their winning chances as White, assuming an opponent of equal strength. The an- swers were all in the range 80-90%. The general feeling was that such a po- sition should objectively be a win, and the 'missing' 10-20% represented the probability of making a mistake one- self rather than the probability of run- ning into exceptionally good defence. A search of 500,000 games re- vealed 94 clear-cut examples of this type of structure (3 vs 3 on one side, 3 vs 2 on the other, no doubled pawns and pawns not blocked). The result was 72 wins, 19 draws and 3 losses(I). The 77% success rate was slightly lower than the GMs thought, but at their level technique is better and so, assuming that the position is objec- tively won, they would be more likely to round up the point. They probably also wouldn't lose a rook ending with a clear extra pawn! Unfortunately, such situations are poorly covered in endgame theory books, which tend to concentrate on more simplified positions. While they devote a lot of attention to the situation with 3 vs 3 on one side and an outside passed pawn on the other wing, the situation in which there is a majority rather than a passed pawn is hardly covered at all. The massive Encyclo- paedia of Chess Endings, with 1727 positions, doesn't contain anything like it, nor do standard works on the endgame such as Levenfish and Smys- lov's famous Rook Endings. Fine's old Basic Chess Endings contains perhaps the most helpful ad- vice. He recommended that if the de- fender's king is on the side where the pawns are balanced then you should adopt the following plan: 1) place the king and rook on the best possible squares; 2) advance the pawns on the other wing as far as convenient, without ac- tually setting up a passed pawn; 3) transpose to a won ending with an outside passed pawn. What he means is that you should not necessarily create the passed pawn as quickly as possible, as some posi- tions with an extra outside passed pawn are drawn. Instead, you should continue to manoeuvre until the passed pawn can be created under favourable circumstances, for example with your rook behind it. If the defender's king is on the side with the potential passed pawn, then the decisive manoeuvre is the penetra- tion of the attacking king on the oppo- site wing. Having played over all the 94 ex- amples mentioned above, I failed to find any clear-cut examples of this winning plan. Either the ending was misplayed by one side or the other, or the defender seemed to assume that he would lose in the long run and em- barked on a desperate bid for counter- play. Thus readers will have to make

do with Nunn vs Fritz5 from the dia- gram on page 128: 1 h4 We are in the second of Fine's cases mentioned above, so White's long- term aim will be to penetrate amongst the queenside pawns with his king. However, at the moment this pawn structure offers no avenues of approach for the king, so White must find a way to induce the pawns to advance. One plan would be to play &el and then at- tack the pawns by Se3-a3, etc., forc- ing them to move forwards. Then White could play Sd3 and Nd2, cross the d-file with his king and then try to get amongst the pawns. Perhaps this plan is the most sys- tematic, but I decided on another idea, that of advancing the kingside pawns. If Black remains passive, White will gain a great deal of space on the king- side and should eventually be able to create a passed pawn there under fa- vourable circumstances. If Black tries to generate counterplay by advancing his queenside pawns, then White will again have the possibility of switching his king to the other side of the board. I...b5 1 doubt that a human would defend in such forthright style! Fritz decides to gain space on the queenside, but it is creating precisely the sort of openings that will help White later on.
2 g4 a5 3 Ng3 a4 4 a3
It is a good idea not to let the queen- side pawns advance too far. Later on the black rook may switch behind the pawns, and this could prove very awk- ward if Black has pawns on a4 and b4. Now that Black has advanced a pawn to a4, White can conveniently halt the pawns by a3 and c3, which also makes his queenside safe against an attack by Black's rook.
4...5dl 5 h5
In rook endings it is quite often a good idea to have such a chain of pawns. If the white rook defends the base of the chain, then all the pawns are secure against enemy rook attack.

It is possible to set up simplified, idealized positions and play them out against the computer. The best method is to play the same position several times for both col- ours, trying different ideas to see what works and what doesn't. This kind of experience cannot be gained in over- the-board play. We will return to this subject in Chapter 5. Many endings with an extra pawn eventually reduce to the situation in which the pawns are equal on one side and one player has an outside passed pawn on the opposite wing. The re- mainder of the section deals with this common occurrence. For the sake of simplicity, let's assume that White possesses an extra pawn on the queen- side. White's rook will need to defend the pawn, and there are three possible positions for the rook: behind the pawn, to the side of the pawn, and in front of the pawn. This list is arranged in descending order of desirability from White's point of view. The situation in which White's rook is behind the pawn is a familiar one. plan, but White loses nothing by try- ing it before considering other ideas.

132 SECRETS OF PRACTICAL CHESS
The pawn is continually threatening to advance, so Black has to block the pawn with his rook. Not only does the rook become tied down, but Black is left open to the possibility of zugzwang. The classic example of this situation is also one of the best: situation is just as if he had lost the op- position in a king and pawn ending. After ...Nd5, White plays b4 and supports his pawn with the king; after ... b5, White can head for the king- side pawns with his king. Black can only avoid these lines by playing pawn moves on the kingside, but White can always move his rook up and down, so that Black is sure to fall into zugzwang sooner or later.

Now the king heads for the vulner- able enemy pawns.

As with any pro- posed rule, there are exceptions (for example, a position with rook on al and pawn on a2 against rook on a3 would be far less favourable!), but in normal situations such positions are extremely favourable for White. The further away from the kingside the pawn is, the better for White, but even with a c-pawn his winning prospects would be good. When the rook defends the pawn from the side (we will assume the rook is to the right of the pawn), Black will place his rook behind the pawn. Then much depends on the kingside pawn structure. The white rook is vulner- able to attack by Black's king, and the best situation arises when the rook can occupy an invulnerable square on the kingside where it is defended by a pawn. The alternative is to defend the f7- pawn along the second rank by 66...Se7 67 *g7 Sd7 68 *f6 2c7, but White wins after 69 2e2 <Nxa5 70 Se7 Sc2 71 2xf7 2xf2+ 72 *xg6 Sg2 73 2f3. 67 f4?I By exposing the pawn on g3, Ale- khine makes the win more difficult.

The final case, when the white rook is in front of the pawn, offers the few- est winning chances. Indeed, most po- sitions are drawn. Even in the most favourable case (that of a b-pawn) it is unclear whether White can win unless he has an additional advantage, such as a weak enemy pawn structure on the kingside. B. Spassky - Zhu Chen Veterans vs Women, Copenhagen 1997 Here White has an ideal position on the kingside. His rook can settle at f5, creating a cosy little cluster of pieces defending each other. Black can only break this up by playing ...h5 at a mo- ment when both her rook is attacking the pawn on f3 and the white king is not defending it. However, it turns out that this possibility is of little value to Black. White can win by simply playing his king to cl. If the black rook stays on the second rank, White pushes the b-pawn. Otherwise the king has to be released and it can then advance.

THE ENDGAME 135
The situation with an extra pawn and all the pawns on the same side also occurs quite often in practice. Here is a typical position: Endings with 3 vs 2 (and no passed pawns) on one side are also drawn; again the same principles apply. If you remove the pawns on e3 and f7 from the above diagram, Black's safest first move is again l...h5!. White to play could try 1 g4, but here his winning chances would only be very small. Positional advantage We have already mentioned that piece activity is extremely important in rook and pawn endings (see page 92). A rook on the seventh usually ties the opponent's pieces down to defensive positions, while a king penetrating into the opposing pawn-mass can make mincemeat of them. Another point is that a passive rook is very often per- manently passive. Here is an example, taken from Levenfish and Smyslov's classic book Rook Endings. Black's ideal defensive pawn struc- ture is f7-g6-h5. White's only chance is ultimately to create a passed pawn, and this pawn formation means that White can only make one at the cost of several pawn exchanges. First he must play g4, when Black can swap his fa- pawn. Then White will aim for f5, but another pair of pawns disappears. It follows that once Black has achieved this optimal set-up, White's winning chances are minimal. Thus if Black is to play in the diagram, l...h5! is the right move. If White moves first, then of course he plays 1 g4!. While the resulting po- sition is still theoretically drawn, there is no doubt that in practice Black's task is rather difficult. Black cannot prevent White from gaining a lot of space on the kingside (Ng2-g3, h4-h5, etc.) and his defence is not easy. St Petersburg - London Telegraph match, 1886-7

If White plays a7 at any stage, then there is no shelter for White's king on the queen- side. However, if the pawn stays on a6 then Black can safely take the g4- pawn and return to a4. At this point London conceded the game. Chigorin gave analysis indicat- ing that White could win and the posi- tion has been subject to considerable debate ever since. Levenfish and Smys- lov gave the verdict that Black could draw, but only with very precise play. The white rook can range freely across the fifth rank, while Black's is restricted to just three squares. First of all, defending passively is no good. White can move his king towards the vulnerable a-pawn and the defence eventually breaks down: l...Sa7 2 e4 Sa6 3 4>d4 Ba7 4 f4 Sa6 (or 4...Nd6 5 Sb6+ *e7 6 *c5 Sc7+ 7 <Nb5 Scl 8 g5 f5 9 Bxg6 Sfl 10 *xa5 Bxf4 11 Sf6 Sfl 12 *b6 f4 13 a5 Sgl 14 Bxf4 Bxg5 15 a6 Bg6+ 16 *b7 Sgl 17 Bb4 and wins) 5 Bb7+ Nd6 6 f5 gxf5 7 gxf5 Ba8 8 Bb6+ *e7 9 *c5 Sd8 10 Bb5 and White wins the a-pawn while retaining both his pawns. With his pieces so actively placed, this means a sure win. Very often in such situations, it is better to jettison the weak pawn and try to activate the rook, and here this plan just about draws for Black. Note that Black must not delay; if he allows White's pieces to become any more active before giving up the pawn, then the game will be past saving. The best line is l...Bc6! 2 Sxa5 Sc4+ 3 *e3 &f 7!

of a well-thought-out plan for putting White's central pawn majority to use. The obvious plan is to play e4 at some stage, but for this White needs the sup- port of the king (note that the rook should stay on the c-file to prevent ...c5). White could try e3, Ne2-d3 and then e4, but Black could counter this plan by playing ...f5 at some point. The move played not only makes it much harder for Black to play ...f5, but also opens up a second possibility for activating the white king, based on Sc2 and Ng3-f4.

THE ENDGAME 139
Knight endings a draw since 1 Nb6 again gives a per- petual attack on the knight. If the pawn is on a4 and knight on a5 then White loses even if he can attack the knight with 1 bS on the first move; Black just plays l...Ng5 and when he promotes on hl, White is prevented from promoting on a8. Now suppose that the pawn is on b7 and knight on b8, with Black to play. The position is drawn by repetition: neither side can deviate from the se- quence l...£te6+ 2 Nb6 £fo8 3 Nc7 (3 Na7? Nd7 would win for Black)
3...Na6+.
Now move the pawn to b6 and the knight to b7. Black to plays wins by
1...?)a5, because the white king takes
far too long to make it round to attack the knight (note that even 1 Nd6 is im- possible because of l... c4+). How- ever, White's loss here was due to the poor initial position of his king on c7. If the king starts on c6, then the posi- tion is a draw since l... a5+ 2 Nb5 and 1...£ki8+ 2 Nd7 both lead to repe- titions. With the pawn on b5 and knight on b6, it doesn't matter where the white king is; Black always wins since he can generate an unlimited supply of tempi. If White attacks the knight by 1 Nc6, then l...Na4 wins as before, while 1 c5 is met by l...Nc8, and 2 <Nc6 fails to 2...?)a7+. With a c-pawn, Black wins even with the pawn on the seventh rank. If Black's knight is on c8, he can meet Nd7 by ...?)a7 and Nb7 by ...£te7, Here is a common situation - the knight is single-handedly holding back a passed pawn. There are three possible outcomes to such a struggle: either the knight loses the battle against the white king and pawn, and the pawn pro- motes. Then White wins. Alternatively, the white king cannot achieve more than a perpetual attack on the knight; then the result is a draw. Finally, it may be that the knight can not only restrain the pawn, but can do so while provid- ing a continuous supply of spare tempi. Then Black has time to advance his fa- pawn and win. The diagram position is a draw. The knight can prevent the pawn's promo- tion but without providing any spare tempi: 1 *b7 Nb5 2 *b6 Nd6! 3 *c6 c8 4 <Nc7 Na7 and so on. If the pawn is on a7 and the knight on a8, then of course White wins by 1 *b7. Moving the other way, with the pawn on a5 and knight on a6, the position is

Moving on to knight vs knight end- ings, the most important point to note is the devastating effect of an outside passed pawn. The knight is such a short-range piece that if it is prevent- ing the advance of a passed pawn on the queenside, then it cannot exert any influence on the kingside. Thus the side with the outside passed pawn will be effectively a piece up on the other side of the board. Knights are particu- larly ineffective against rook's pawns: S. Dolmatov - A. Beliavsky USSR Championship, Odessa 1989 Here Black is fighting against two rook's pawns. Despite material equal- ity and the small number of pawns, White has a winning position.

Bishop vs Knight endings S. Flohr - J. Capablanca Moscow 1935 The relative value of the bishop and the knight is a familiar topic in every phase of the game, and the basic prin- ciples are the same in an ending. On average, a bishop is worth a lit- tle more than a knight. A bishop is at its best in an open position with a fluid pawn structure. Pawns fixed on the same colour as the squares on which the bishop moves are an obstruction; the more such pawns exist, the more restricted the bishop is and the weaker the squares of the opposite colour. Knights favour blocked pawn struc- tures and like stable, invulnerable squares on which they can settle with- out being disturbed by enemy pawns. A typical such situation arises when a knight occupies the square in front of an isolated pawn, as in the following diagram. We will not discuss this very com- plicated endgame in detail here. Capa- blanca, who was one of the greatest endgame players of all time, just about managed to save the game, but I would doubt my ability to do likewise! He adopted what is undoubtedly the cor- rect plan, namely to avoid allowing any more pawns to be fixed on light squares. He therefore played ...b6, ...a5, ..Bd7 and ...f6, and waited to see if White could make progress. It is worth noting that if Black had a dark-squared bishop, then the position would be a comfortable draw. If, on the other hand, Black had a further pawn weakness, for example the pawn on b7 were on b5 (so that White could fix the queenside pawns by playing b4), then he would be lost. It is worth adding one point which applies particularly to the endgame. Bishops prefer positions with unbal- anced pawn structures. If both sides create a passed pawn, a bishop can sup- port the friendly passed pawn while at the same time holding up the enemy
142 SECRETS OF PRACTICAL CHESS
knight in this open position, and his king is slightly more active. 3O...h5 There is nothing wrong with this move. It allows a possible penetration by the white king via f4 to g5, but in it- self this is not dangerous as the simple reply ... f? secures the kingside pawn structure. 31 £el e5 32 Nf2 (D) White aims to provoke a pawn move on the queenside, so as to provide a possible entry route for White's king on that side also. passed pawn. Knights, being short- range pieces, have to be committed to one or the other task. Players often underestimate the ad- vantage which is conferred by having a bishop against a knight, even in posi- tions with symmetrical pawn struc- tures. Z. Ilincic - G. Cabrilo Cetinje 1992 I suspect that many players would abandon the position as a draw, but in the game White won. Ilindid anno- tated his game in both Informator and the Encyclopaedia of Chess Endings, claiming that the diagram position is actually winning for White. As we shall see, this claim is rather far- fetched, but it is true that White's ad- vantage is sufficient to justify playing on.

Bishop endings Considering the case of same-coloured bishops first, the outside passed pawn is again a very powerful force, even if not quite so effective as in knight end- ings. I would therefore normally ex- pect endings with 3 vs 3 on one side and an extra outside passed pawn on the other side to be winning, although if the passed pawn is not too far away

144 SECRETS OF PRACTICAL CHESS
from the remaining pawns there is a small chance of a blockade. With all the pawns on the same side, a 3 vs 2 or 4 vs 3 ending with fluid pawns should normally be a draw. Since bishops are heavily influenced by fixed pawns, one of the most im- portant questions is how many pawns are fixed on the same-coloured squares as one's bishop. The more there are, the worse it is, all the more so in that the opponent's bishop will automati- cally be a 'good' bishop. Two pawns fixed on the same colour as one's bishop may be a fatal weakness, espe- cially if they can both be attacked si- multaneously by the opposing bishop. This completely immobilizes one's own bishop, and zugzwang may not be far away. passed pawns are better than passed pawns with only one file between them, but two widely-separated passed pawns are best of all. 3) If you are trying to draw an opposite-coloured bishop ending, then it is better to have your pawns on the same-coloured squares as your bishop. This is practically the only type of po- sition in which this reversal of the nor- mal principle applies. The reason is that your drawing chances depend on setting up an unbreakable fortress. Everything has to be defended, and a pawn which is capable of being at- tacked by the enemy bishop will just drop off. Here are a couple of examples illus- trating these principles: Opposite-coloured bishop endings are often quite tricky because many of the principles that apply in a wide range of endings break down in this case. Here are some of the main differ- ences: 1) Material advantage is less im- portant than usual. Endings with one extra pawn are usually drawn. Even two extra pawns may not be sufficient to win. For this reason reduction to an opposite-coloured bishop ending is often a useful drawing resource in a desperate situation. 2) What is important is the ability to create passed pawns. If you can cre- ate two passed pawns, then you have good winning chances. Connected Y. Piskov - J. Nunn Bundesliga 1992 Black is in a difficult position be- cause his king is more exposed. While there are still heavy pieces on the

Threatening to win a pawn by means of ..Bd3 followed by ..Bc4. 43 a3 White has two extra connected passed pawns, and if he could support them with his king then he would be winning. However, his king is too far away and by attacking the pawns with his bishop, Black can force them to ad- vance to dark squares, when it is easy to blockade them. The defender must keep his pawns on the same-coloured squares as his bishop, but the opposite holds true for the attacker. He must try to avoid the blockade of the pawns, and so they should occupy squares of the opposite colour to his bishop. This usually means that they must be de- fended by the king.

Black defended the g-pawn in the only way possible, by heading for h4. L.JLel At first sight this is a dead draw. If White's king attacks the g5-pawn, then Black plays ...Bh4 and waits with his king, while if White's king approaches the c-pawn, then Black's bishop is freed and so he can just keep his king on c7. This is in accordance with the principle that you need two
146 SECRETS OF PRACTICAL CHESS
passed pawns to have a chance of win- ning an opposite-coloured bishop end- ing. 2 *f6! White's plan is to force the bishop to h4 and then play g3. If Black replies ..Bxg3, White continues xgS and has his second passed pawn. If Black replies ...fxg3, White plays Bg2 and the black bishop is imprisoned. When the white king approaches the c-pawn, Black will be forced to release his bishop by ...g4, again giving White another passed pawn. However, this plan must be imple- mented accurately. After 2 Nf5 Bh4 3 g3 fxg3 4 Bg2 Nd6 White experi- ences certain difficulties. He cannot move his king to f6 or e4 and after 5 4g4 <Nc7 he is not making progress. In fact, this is very much like a king and pawn ending, since both sides can only move their kings (if White moves his bishop, then ...g2 draws at once). White can try to exploit the fact that d7 is not available for Black's king by 5 Ng6 e6 6 h7, but his subtlety is to no avail: after 6...&C7 7 Ng7 e8 White cannot 'by-pass' by 8 f6. The key is to lose a tempo before the bishop arrives on h4.

THE ENDGAME 147
6 Ne5 g4
Otherwise the king reaches d6 and that would really be Black's last chance to play ...g4 before White promotes his pawn. 7 hxg4 White wins easily by supporting the passed g-pawn with his king. It is worth noting that Black only loses in the diagram as he cannot de- fend the g5-pawn from d8 or e7. If his king were on the apparently inferior square b8, then l..Ba5 would draw. I must emphasize that the special principles mentioned above apply only to pure opposite-coloured bishop situations. As soon as extra pieces are added to the equation, normal service is resumed. Many players assume that endings with rooks and opposite- coloured bishops are almost as drawn as pure opposite-bishop positions, but this is not so. An extra pawn in an end- ing with rooks and opposite-coloured bishops normally confers good win- ning chances; adding a pair of knights is similar. If even more pieces are added then the attacking potential of opposite-coloured bishops starts to come into play, and then one cannot talk about a drawish influence at all. Queen endings Queen and Pawn vs Queen Of all the fundamental endings with piece 4- pawn vs piece, this is the second most common in practice (the most common being rook and pawn vs rook). It is also by far the most compli- cated, so much so that it has proved too daunting for the majority of authors and very little has been written about it. Before the advent of the computer database, Averbakh provided the best coverage. However, the complexity of the ending was only emphasized by the fact that his seventy pages of analysis dealt almost exclusively with certain simple cases of the pawn on the seventh rank. Now that the oracle of a perfect da- tabase has been constructed, one would have expected someone to provide a far more detailed explanation of the principles behind the ending. How- ever, the database has revealed that Averbakh's efforts only scratched the veneer of this ending and most of the real work remains to be done. I suppose I could stop here with the comment 'nobody understands W+A vs W', but this does seem a little cow- ardly. The first point to make is that if the defending king is in front of the pawn then the position is almost always drawn. There are exceptions in which a winning exchange of queens can be forced, but they are very few indeed. Thus the only interesting case is when the defending king cannot move in front of the pawn. Dealing firstly with the a-pawn, this not surprisingly offers the fewest winning chances of any pawn. The diagram below shows a
148 SECRETS OF PRACTICAL CHESS
typical situation with the pawn on the sixth. optimally over the board? Our objec- tive is only to establish some general principles helpful in practical play and for this the 50-move rule is not espe- cially relevant. This diagram already reveals many of the important principles governing Q+A vs W. We can ignore the 'special case' squares a7 and a8, which are only marked because White to play can mate in one. There are basically two drawing zones. One lies near to the pawn and these squares are drawn because with the enemy king so close to the pawn, Black can very often ex- change queens and catch the pawn with his king. Virtually all W+A vs W posi- tions (except those with the pawn on the seventh) have such a zone, which we call the proximity zone. When the black king lies in the proximity zone, White is restricted in his attempts to avoid perpetual check, as he can only interpose his queen in favourable cir- cumstances. There is a popular myth that when defending W+ A vs it is always best to have your king as far away from the pawn as possible; as we shall see, this is true only in certain circumstances. The second drawing zone is in the lower right-hand corner, i.e. diago- nally opposite the pawn. White's main weapon in preventing perpetual check is to interpose his queen in such a way as to force the exchange of queens, ei- ther by checking or by pinning the en- emy queen. When the black king is poorly placed, for example on f7, then We will display several diagrams of this type, the aim being to convey a great deal of information in a visual form. The various stars indicate the re- sult when the black king stands on that square. A white star indicates that the position is a win with White to move, but a draw with Black to move. A black star indicates that it is a win whoever moves first. Unmarked squares are drawn whoever moves first. In the case of squares that are under attack by White, then the position is only legal with Black to move and a black star indicates that it is a win; no star indicates that it is drawn. A few positions are illegal because the kings stand next to each other; these are also unmarked. Readers should note that we take no account of the 50-move rule in our dis- cussion. With optimal play, some of the positions are drawn only because of this rule, but who is going to play
THE ENDGAME 149
1...4g3! (although it would be amaz-
ing if anyone realized over the board that 1...4*h3? is losing). If the king starts on e4, there is a choice between
1...4d5 and 1...4f3, but I would al-
ways go for the proximity zone if pos- sible, as the draw is far simpler. Summing up, the proximity zone is the best location for the black king, then the bottom-right corner, then the bottom-left corner. The top right cor- ner is by far the worst. If we move the pawn back to a5, the drawing zones expand enormously: there are many chances to achieve this and Black's options are consequently restricted. White can set up a position with his king on b7 and queen on c6. Then l...Qe7+ is answered by 2 Rc7, l...Rb4+ 2 4*c8 Qf8+ 3 4c7 ends the checks, I..>b3+2*c8 and l..>bl+ 2 4*a8 likewise. The toughest check to meet is 1...18132+, but even in this case White can manoeuvre so as eventually to force Black to give one of the infe- rior checks mentioned above. In the end Black's checks dry up, and White can push his pawn. This problem af- flicts Black whenever his king is in the top right-hand corner. The lower left- hand corner is also not ideal, but this largely depends on Black's queen po- sition. If Black can occupy a good square with his queen, then this is suf- ficient to draw. The bottom right-hand comer is the best of the distant areas; White has very few chances to inter- pose with check and so Black has few problems drawing. While much of the play is governed by general principles, there are a few anomalies. The isolated loss with the black king on h3 (when 1 Qd4 ! is the only winning move) is hard to explain, as is the loss with Black to move when his king is on c2. The point about the two drawing zones is emphasized if we imagine the black king starting somewhere on Black's fifth rank. With the king on d4, the only drawing move is 1...4>d5!, entering the proximity zone. When the king is on h4, the only move is The lower-left squares are marked only because White has the possibility of Qa3+, forcing an immediate ex- change of queens, so we can fairly say that Black is only in danger if his king is in the upper-right comer. We can summarize by saying that with an a-pawn, the pawn needs to be on at least the sixth rank in order to have decent winning chances. Not surprisingly, the b-pawn offers far more winning chances. There are
150 SECRETS OF PRACTICAL CHESS
two main reasons. First of all, the white king has the squares on the a-file to aid him in his efforts to avoid per- petual check. Secondly, an exchange of queens is much less likely to lead to a draw, even when Black's king is quite close to the pawn, so the proximity zone is much reduced in size. Here is a typical case with the pawn on b6 (D): king on certain d-file squares, but only if it is his turn to move, and even then the draw requires great accuracy. With the king on d8, Black's unique drawing move is l...Qgl!, with the king on d7 again there is only one move, 1...Qhl !, and with the king on d6, 1...Qd5! is the only saving possi- bility. The drawing zone in the bottom- right corner is relatively large, and it is clear that against a b-pawn, if you can- not bring your king in front of the pawn, then this is the area to head for. We do not give the details in the case of the pawn on b4; the situation is somewhat similar to that of the pawn on a5, i.e. White can only win if the black king is near to the top-right cor- ner. To summarize, with a b-pawn the pawn should be on at least the fifth rank to provide good winning chances. The c-pawn provides the greatest winning chances of any pawn. One reason is that the drawing zone in the bottom-right corner disappears when We can see how vastly different this situation is. If White is to move then he wins no matter where Black's king is located. With Black to play there is a small drawing zone in front of the pawn, and a slightly larger one in the bottom right-hand corner. With the pawn on b5 White's win- ning chances are of course less than with the pawn on b6, but still greater than with the pawn on a6 (D): Here we see the familiar pattern emerging, but with some differences. The proximity zone is much smaller than with the a-pawn; it includes all the squares in front of the pawn, but little else. Black can draw with his
THE ENDGAME 151
the pawn is on at least the fourth rank, so in this case Black is left only with the proximity zone. The situation with the pawn on c6 needs no diagram, because Black is losing except if his king is in front of the pawn. When the pawn is on c5, the drawing chances are still very slim, except if the king is in front of the pawn: It follows that if you have various methods of liquidating to W+A vs If, the c-pawn is the one to go for. The de- fender's only chance is to bring his king near to the pawn, but even with the pawn as far back as the fourth rank there are still good winning chances. Central pawns offer significantly fewer chances than with the c-pawn. Once again, there is no distant draw- ing zone and the defender should have his king somewhere near the enemy pawn. Here are two typical diagrams: Even with a pawn on c4, White's winning prospects are surprisingly good:

Qb3-c3-c5 and drive the enemy queen away. The pawn can then be advanced and, if necessary, the manoeuvre can be repeated all the way down the board. This would be the winning tech- nique in the case that the kings are on the kingside and White's king is safe from perpetual check. Note that we are assuming that Black cannot ex- change queens. This is normally a safe assumption, but there might be cases in which Black could swap on c5, take the c-pawn with his king and return to the kingside in time to save the game. In that case White might do better to play Qb3-a3-a5 in order to advance the pawn. The problem with this is that it badly decentralizes the white queen, and while the queen is away, Black's own queen can take up an ac- tive post, increasing his chances of perpetual check. If the white king is not safe from perpetual check, then the win is much more complicated, if indeed it is pos- sible at all. The plan is again to try to push the pawn using the above ma- noeuvre, and when the black queen starts checking, the white king will run to the queenside, where his pawn and queen stand ready to provide shel- ter. It is important to bear in mind that a barrage of random checks from the enemy queen very rarely amounts to a perpetual, provided that one's own queen occupies a central position and there is at least one pawn for shelter. Therefore White should have no In the second diagram the drawing zone has expanded considerably and encompasses quite a large part of the board. The square a4 is rather anoma- lous (White to play wins only with 1 *c5!). Just as with the c-pawn, the defend- ing king should be as near to the pawn as possible. It is worth noting that it is much better for the defender to have his king on the short side of the pawn than the long side. The extra Pawn Just as in the case of rook endings, queen endings with an extra outside passed pawn are relatively common. It is hard to say whether the winning chances are greater or less than in the case of rooks. Objectively speaking, I suspect that they should be greater, but there are far more chances for things to go wrong with queens on the board! The main danger is that of perpetual check, so king safety is an important factor. Unlike the corresponding situation with a rook, a queen is capable of shepherding a pawn to the promotion square all on its own. Suppose, for ex- ample, White has a passed pawn on b4 supported by a queen on bl, and that Black has blockaded the pawn with his queen on b5. If the queens were re- placed by rooks, then the pawn could not advance without either zugzwang or the approach of White's king. With queens, however, White can continue

As a matter of fact, this position would be a win even without the fa- pawns, but their presence certainly makes Black's task simpler. White has no threat, so Black simply creeps for- ward with his h-pawn. When it arrives on h3, White will have mating threats to contend with in addition to the passed c-pawn.

One unusual feature of the position is that Black is prepared to leave his h6-pawn undefended. Nor- mally, every pawn has to be protected to avoid being gobbled up by the en- emy queen, but in this special case the possibility of ...Qe3+ provides an in- direct defence.

An ending with 4 vs 3 offers fair winning chances, and even 3 vs 2 is sometimes won in practice, although I have no doubt that theoreti- cally it should be a draw. Common endings without Pawns Rook vs minor piece The ending rook vs bishop (without pawns) arises occasionally. There are three important things to know about this ending. First of all, in a general initial position this ending is totally drawn. Secondly, if the defender's king is trapped in the corner then he can draw if his bishop moves on squares of opposite colour to the cor- ner square; otherwise it is lost. The reason is quite simple (D). Here White can try 1 Sa8+, but af- ter 1..Bg8 he must lift the stalemate. This involves either letting the black king out of the corner, or unpinning the bishop. The only other reasonable winning attempt is 1 Sh7+ Ng8 2 Sb7, attacking the bishop and threat- ening mate on b8, but Black has the saving move 2..Bc2+. However, it is worth noting that after 1 Ha8+ Bg8 2 Sa7, for example, 2...Be6? would allow 3 Hh7+ Ng8 4 He7 and White wins (checking distance again). If we move the bishop from b3 to b4, then White wins even if Black moves first, for example l."Ng8 2 Sa8+ Bf8 3 Sb8 and mate next move. The third important point is the fol- lowing position. In this case Black's king is near the 'wrong' comer and in fact the position is lost whoever moves first. The im- portant point is that the result is the
156 SECRETS OF PRACTICAL CHESS
same no matter where Black's bishop is positioned, so long as it is on a dark square. The winning method runs 1 Hfl Bh2 (l...Ah4 2 Hf3 Nd8 3 Sf4 forces the bishop to a bad square, winning af- ter 3...Ae7 4 Sa4 or 3...Nb6 4 Sb4 Bc7 5 Sc4) 2 Hf2 Ng3 (Black tries to keep the bishop sheltered behind the white king for as long as possible;
2...JLgl 3 Hg2 also drives the bishop
out) 3 Hg2 Bd6 (3...M4 and 3...Nf4 are impossible because White wins the bishop with a discovered check) 4 Hd2 Be7 5 Ha2 and again White wins the bishop. Rook vs knight is another ending which occasionally arises in practice. It can even result from some endings of rook vs pawn in which the pawn has to underpromote to avoid mate. While the details of the ending are signifi- cantly more complicated than with rook vs bishop, the one basic principle is clear enough: if the king and knight are not separated, then this ending is almost always a draw. Even if the de- fending king is on the edge of the board (this situation arises automati- cally in the underpromotion cases), then the position is usually drawn. Black's king is in a relatively unfa- vourable position near the corner of the board, but there is just enough space to hold the draw. However, ac- curate defence is required. Play might continue 1 Nf6 £}h7+ 2 Ng6 Qf8+ 3 *h6 *h8 4 Sf7 (4 Hg7 Ne6! 5 Sf7 Ng8! is also a draw) 4...<Ng8! 5 Sg7+ h8 6 Hgl (this is the key moment; Black must play carefully) and now: 1) 6...Nh7?7*g6!*g8(7... f8+

Whilst this marginal position re- quires accurate play, the general situa- tion (king and knight next to each other and away from the edge of the board) is a comfortable draw. Lost positions of the type that arise in over-the-board play generally fall into two categories. The first arises when the king and knight are next to each other, but are poorly placed. One obvious case is when Black's king is trapped in a corner. A less obvious possibility is when Black's king is on

The position with the black king on g8 and knight on g7 is one of the worst defensive formations and is quite often lost if the white king is nearby (for example, with the king on f6 and rook on al Black loses even if he moves first). The second category consists of po- sitions in which the king and knight are separated and cannot join up. Sometimes the win is quite simple, but in others subtle play is required to keep the king and knight apart while at the same time making progress. If the knight cannot be trapped directly, then it is important to keep the defender's king restricted. The attacker some- times has to use his own king for this purpose, even though it is counter- intuitive to move it away from the en- emy knight. A. Karpov - L. Ftacnik Thessaloniki Olympiad 1988

1-0 Rook and minor piece vs Rook This occurs quite often in practice. The general position is a draw, whether the minor piece is a bishop or a knight, but the practical winning chances de- pend very much on which minor piece is involved. The ending of vs S should be a simple draw as there are only a few winning positions. Almost all of these have the defending king badly placed near a corner, and nothing like this can be forced from a normal starting posi- tion. The general feeling amongst GMs has been that there is no point in carrying on this ending because there are no real winning chances. However, the following ending may cause this judgement to be modified

As 91 Sf8 Ng6 92 Sg8+ Nf7 wins. It is up to the individual whether to continue this ending, but I would only regard it as worthwhile in the case of a quick-play finish. If one is the defender, then the main advice is perfectly obvious: try to keep your king away from the edge of the board or, failing that, try to keep it away from the corner. However, even if you do find yourself in a less favour- able position, don't despair - even with the king in the corner many positions are drawn. The ending of fi+JL vs S is one of the most common pawnless endings to arise in practice. In general it should be a draw, but the defence requires considerable accuracy and grandmas- ters have been known to lose it even in the days of adjournments. There are two basic drawing techniques, and it is worth knowing both of them because the position you find yourself in may be more suited to one rather than the other. The following diagram is the basic position of the 'Cochrane Defence'. The black rook is pinning the enemy bishop and this prevents the white king approaching its counterpart. The only way to unpin is to play Nd5 or Nd3, but then the black king moves I. Rogers - M. Illescas Spanish Team Championship 1996 along the edge of the board away from the white king. Thus Black avoids the most dangerous situation, that in which White creates mating threats by hav- ing his king directly opposite Black's. 78 *d5 Of course 78 Nd3 is answered by
78...*a5.
78...*a3
It is worth pointing out that the Co- chrane Defence is most effective when the black king is near the mid-point of one edge. If, for example, the same formation were set up along the third rank, then the corresponding move would take the black king to a2, dan- gerously near the comer.

There- fore White has to use the second of the two drawing techniques, the 'second- rank defence'. 87 2d2 The basic idea is to defend pas- sively with both king and rook on the second rank. White will just oscillate with his rook between c2 and d2 until Black undertakes positive action.

If Black plays 2...Sel, then 3 Af3 is a reflection of the position after White's fifth move in the main line. After 2...He2, White's ultimate aim is to force Black's rook to the third rank. 3Bh7 A waiting move to force Black's rook to the slightly inferior square el. After 3...Se3 White wins as in the pre- vious note.

White's winning line only works when his rook is on f7 or b7. The side-to-side manoeuvres are typical of this ending; Black is forced to follow suit and oscillate with his own rook between el and cl, but this gives White the chance to transfer his rook from h7 to b7 with gain of tempo.

Quick-play finishes These days the normal method of fin- ishing a long game is the 'quick-play finish' in which, from a certain point on, the players have a fixed amount of time to complete the game, no matter how many moves this might take. In international competitions, the quick- play finish normally comes into effect at move 60, and players are generally given half an hour (sometimes an hour), in addition to any time they still have, to complete the game. Quick-play finishes only affect a relatively small percentage of tourna- ment games, but it is important to be aware of the impact such a finish may have on certain endgames. There are many endings in which the odds would favour a draw at a traditional time- limit, but in a quick-play finish the balance of probabilities is changed. Quick-play finishes also put a pre- mium on memorized knowledge; after the exhaustion of six hours' play, and with limited time on the clock, work- ing out a complex ending is very diffi- cult - you just have to know how to play certain positions. It should be noted that in most cases the speeding up of play will favour the side trying to win, because he can go round and round several times, each time hoping for a mistake, whereas the defender only has to go wrong once. Here is a quick round-up of the most common endings where the result might be affected: 1) Rook and bishop vs rook. The drawing techniques are fairly well- known, but to apply them in practice requires considerable thought. I would not care to defend this in a quick-play finish. 2) Rook and knight vs rook. Should be comfortably drawn at a normal time-limit, but in a quick-play finish it might be worth continuing (as Kaspa- rov showed). 3) Queen and pawn vs queen. Of course, some positions are objectively lost, but even many of the drawn posi- tions require very accurate defence. I imagine that the 'marginal' drawn po- sitions would be almost impossible to defend in a quick-play finish, and even some of the fairly comfortable draws would probably be difficult. 4) Rook and pawn vs rook. Posi- tions which are drawn by the standard 'third-rank' defence would still be drawn in quick-play. In more complex positions, there would of course be more errors, but in these endings the attacker also has to play accurately, so the accelerated tempo probably makes the task equally difficult for both play- ers.
THE ENDGAME 165
If one can liquidate to a variety of different endings, then the fact that there is a quick-play finish might af- fect one's decision as to which to aim for. If one evaluates 2+JL vs 5 as an 80% chance of a win (which seems reasonable) then one might prefer that to a line in which one has a clear positional advantage but not necessar- ily a win. It is perhaps unfortunate that modi- fications to the time-limit can cause what amounts to an alteration in the evaluation of certain endings, but that is the price one has to pay for the elimination of adjournments.
5 Using a Computer
Game databases When non-chess players think of a grandmaster making use of a com- puter, they probably think of playing programs. However, at this level the main use of a computer is to access a large database of games. There are two main uses for a data- base. For the professional, examining the games of prospective opponents is part of the job. If you are participating in a round-robin tournament, some of this may be done before the event, but in a Swiss event it can only be done when the pairings are known, which normally does not allow much time for preparation. The second use is to look at the games played in specific opening lines. If you are intending to play a particular variation in the afternoon, a quick scan of the database to see if there are any recent games is very helpful. You might get a new idea, or you might see something potentially dangerous for your opponent. For home preparation, a database is also extremely useful. Instead of searching through dozens of Informators, New in Chess Yearbooks and other standard references, you can call up all the games in a particular line with a few keystrokes. The games can then be Computers are wonderful tools. In half a century they have moved from a few specialized applications to occupy a central position in our society. Mod- ern civilisation probably could not function without them, so dependent have we become on their services. With the growth of the Internet, a fur- ther communications revolution as great as the introduction of radio and television is upon us. Computers have also had an impact on chess. Early chess computers were laughably weak but, after Deep Blue's defeat of Kasparov in 1997, nobody is laughing now. For a relatively small price, you can buy a chess program in a shop which, running on a standard PC, can defeat virtually anybody ex- cept for IMs and GMs. You can also purchase a database of up to a million games. The question arises as to how these tools can best be used for personal im- provement. The discussion that fol- lows refers to the database program ChessBase and the playing program Fritz. This is not because ChessBase have paid me a wad of money to men- tion their products, but because these are the products I am most familiar with. The discussion is as general as possible and doubtless applies to other, similar, products.
USING A COMPUTER 167
merged into a single game with varia- tions, so that you can easily see the general structure of the variation. If the database program has an interface to a playing module, then at a key- stroke you can set the computer to work analysing any given position. The range of features available is truly astounding, and these days any serious player is virtually obliged to use a database. The main features which I regard as essential for a database program are: 1) It should handle databases of up to a million games without struggling. Of course, you will need a powerful computer to handle such large data- bases, but even so operations on very large databases can be rather slow. 2) It should have facilities for en- tering both variations and text annota- tions, and manipulating these. 3) It should run under the current version of Windows. DOS is dead; forget anything running under DOS. Mac users will have to make do with what is available. 4) It should support openings keys of unlimited depth, and should have facilities for users to modify and ex- pand these. 5) The ability to merge several games into one game with variations is critical. Once you have used this feature, you will not want to do with- out it. 6) There should be an interface to a playing program, so that you just have to hit a key to see the analysis of the current position. A method of pasting this analysis into the game is highly desirable. That deals with the program, but what about the data? Nobody is going to enter a million games by hand, so one is utterly dependent on commer- cial offerings. However, here the situa- tion is much less satisfactory than with the programs. Even the best databases contain a significant number of errors. Poor-quality data is commonplace; indeed, sometimes it is so poor as to make the data practically useless. Some 'commercial' databases are lit- tle more than games collected from every available source, and just lumped together -the 'kitchen sink' approach. Typical problems are: 1) Inconsistent spelling of names. This is perhaps the most irritating. If you are considering buying a data- base, have a look to see if Korchnoi is spelt more than one way in the data- base. If it is, then just forget it. There is nothing more irritating than missing a critical game because you have failed to guess whether the player is 'Korchnoi', 'Korchnoj', 'Kortschnoi' or any of his other close relatives. The same applies to tournaments; you may find games from the same tournament described as 'Wijk aan Zee', 'Wijk', 'Hoogovens', 'WaZ', etc. 2) Duplicate games. This is often a result of problem 1. Sometimes whole tournaments are duplicated because of some minor difference in the spelling of the event name.
168 SECRETS OF PRACTICAL CHESS
you may say. Well, a Trabant and a Rolls-Royce are both cars with four wheels. Unfortunately, the defects of a database are not visible by looking at the shiny surface of the CD-ROM; you actually have to use it before you spot the problems. At the end of the day much of the blame for this situation must be laid at the door of the chess players them- selves. Copying of data is common- place. Why should a company invest thousands of man-hours producing high-quality data if it is just going to be stolen (because that is what copy- ing is in this case)? Software piracy is illegal - don't do it. Once you have a database you will probably want to keep it up to date. There are various commercial services which offer regular 'top-ups' for your database. These days much of the in- formation can be downloaded from the Internet, although then you have all the problems of inconsistent names, forgetting which tournaments you have already included, etc. For really up-to-the-minute material, the Inter- net is unbeatable, but it requires con- siderable effort to keep on top of the flow of data. Unless you really need new games on a week-by-week basis, the pre-packaged commercial offer- ings are probably better. The Internet is wonderful for e-mail, news and spe- cific enquiries for which you can use a search engine. Otherwise it strikes me as being a great time-waster. 3) Incorrect results. This is one of the most common errors. When enter- ing data, most programs have a default option. If the operator forgets to enter the result, you will just get the default result - with a two-thirds chance of being wrong. You may even find com- binations of these errors, for example Korchnoi beat Bareev, but in an amaz- ingly similar game Kortschnoj lost to Barejew. 4) Incorrect moves. The above er- rors are often fairly noticeable, but in- correct moves are trickier to spot. Of course, if the error is such as to leave one player's queen en prise then you might be a bit suspicious, but if it is the wrong rook to d1, then you might never know unless you compare the game with another source. Once, when deal- ing with a collection of games that contained many errors, I came across a particularly grotesque example. I later mentioned it to the grandmaster con- cerned: "Do you know how your game was mangled in this game collection? Ac- cording to their score, your opponent could have mated in two, but instead left his queen en prise with check", I laughed. "But that really happened", he re- plied. Employing a poor-quality database causes immense frustration and waste of time; the small amount of money saved is not worth it. 'But they are both databases with the same games...',
USING A COMPUTER 169
of the 'game' and see where the stu- dent could have played better. Most players don't have a suitable opponent on hand for such exercises, but the computer can perform a similar job and can also help in the post-mortem analysis. Even though computers play endings less strongly than the middle- game, they can still be useful. As dis- cussed on page 131, if you have trouble winning rook and pawn endings with an extra pawn, play out such a position against the computer. It is a good idea to play out the same position several times, trying different plans. You will soon develop a feeling for which plans work and which are ineffective. If you experience trouble winning at all, you may get some ideas by reversing the colours! The computer does have several limitations; in the areas of positional judgement and plan-forming it is of practically no help, and long-term sac- rifices are almost always rejected by the machine. Analysing the Najdorf Poisoned Pawn with the aid of a com- puter is a futile exercise; White's com- pensation is so long-term that the computer does not see it at all, and resolutely assesses every position as winning for Black. Curiously, I find playing normal games against computers much less helpful. Computers have a particular style of play and one soon learns how to avoid their strengths and exploit their weaknesses. This knowledge is of no value against human players, Playing programs The availability of cheap but very strong playing programs for the home PC provides many new opportunities for training and self-improvement. If you already have a computer, I would strongly recommend buying such a program. The most obvious use, that of checking over one's own games, is also one of the most useful. It is amaz- ing how often a computer check re- veals missed tactical ideas. Even if nothing shattering is found, the com- puter often suggests interesting alter- native ideas which were overlooked during the game. It is important not only to play over the game itself, but the tactical lines on which your deci- sions were based. For this reason, you should only consider buying a pro- gram that supports the entry of varia- tions, and can afterwards store the games and variations in a database. You may well find a pattern in the ideas you have missed, and this will provide you with useful information about which areas of your game need special attention. Another use is to play out training positions against a computer. The fa- mous Russian trainer Mark Dvoretsky recommends the method of 'playing out' interesting positions. The idea is that if, for example, one of his students is weak in tactics, Dvoretsky would set the student to play tactical posi- tions against a strong opponent. After- wards they would go over the course
170 SECRETS OF PRACTICAL CHESS
who (normally!) have a very differ- ent set of strengths and weaknesses. Moreover, it is quite easy to become depressed playing against the com- puter. All one really learns is that it is common to overlook tactical points. Playing programs are just starting to have a major impact on grandmas- ter chess. Here is one example: A. Shirov - L. van Wely Monaco Amber (rapid) 1997 Sicilian, Najdorf

15 Nxe6!!
An absolutely stunning innovation, which gives White a clear advantage in every variation. After the game Shi- rov announced that this move had not been discovered by him, but by Fritz. Sure enough, when I set up the posi- tion on my Fritz, the program found 4hxe6 in less than a minute. It is per- haps slightly surprising that Shirov used up his innovation in a rapid event, but he probably felt that since anyone with a Fritz could find this move, it would only be a matter of weeks be- fore someone else played it.

put up considerable resistance in the line was refuted by a computer, but it may be the first in which the human 'innovator' was honest enough to ad- mit it! The question naturally arises as to how many opening innovations are capable of being found by a computer. Every four months a panel of leading grandmasters votes on the most im- portant opening innovations. The re- sults are published in Informator. At the time of writing, the most recent is- sue for which the results of this vote are available is Informator 68, I set Fritz4 to work on the positions in which the top 15 novelties of Informa- tor 68 were played, to see how many the machine would find. In each case I allowed sufficient time for a complete analysis down to 11 ply (although many lines were taken far deeper, of course). The result: Fritz found 3 of the 15 innovations. Of course, there are many problems with such a test, for example some of the 'innovations' may in fact not be good, and will perhaps be refuted in the near future. Another point is that sharp, clear-cut innovations tend to head the Informator list, because a subtle finesse which can only be ap- preciated by specialists in a particular opening line will not score well in 'democratic' voting. In a couple of cases the innovation was Fritz's sec- ond choice, which would certainly alert a human operator to the fact that there was something of interest pres- ent. However, to summarize I would say that Fritz was only of value for ending.
