When most of the pieces are on the board, the number of legal moves is relatively large, and so the tree of analysis expands very quickly the deeper one looks into the position. Humans only look at a tiny part of this tree, but even so a complex piece of tactics can take a long time to calculate; moreover, the result may not be especially accurate. Computers may be more accurate and faster when it comes to tactical analysis, but they have problems when it comes to planning and long- term strategic decisions. Of course, this complexity is what makes chess a game rather than a calculation - if it were possible to evaluate each position definitely, chess would lose its appeal. However, it is fascinating to look at a subset of chess positions which are more amenable to definite analysis. This book is concerned with such a subset - king and pawn endings. At first sight such endings should be quite simple. All the complexity caused by knights, bishops and rooks has disappeared, and queens only put in an appearance in a small percentage of cases. Yet, oddly, this results in a paradox. It is certainly true that the number of legal moves is much less than in a typical middlegame position, and so both computers and humans find it possible to look further into the position. However, this is a double-edged sword; many king and pawn endings are capable of concrete evaluation, so the shades of assessment used for middlegame positions tend to evaporate. No longer can one get away with a 'slight advantage for White', or an 'unclear'. Instead, the player or analyst has to continue his work until he can state 'Win', 'Loss' or 'Draw'. To reach such a conclusion may require exceptionally deep analysis, and prove more troublesome than evaluating a middlegame position. Because king and pawn endings are susceptible to concrete analysis, it might seem that they are the ideal area for computer assistance. However, until recently this has not been the case, and it is only now that some tools are appearing which are of value for the analysis of king and pawn endings. Several years ago databases were created for many five-man endings (my own series of endgame books was based on these), but until very recently there was no database available for the ending K+2P vs K+P. One reason for this is that in order to create such a database, it is first of all necessary to create databases for all the endgames which might result after promotion (or underpromotion) of one or more pawns. Clearly, this is a substantial task. However, the appearance of Hiarcs 7.32, with the accompanying Nalimov tablebases, has provided an easily accessible database for K+2P vs K+P. The appearance of this tool led to a flurry of checking by the authors at a late stage in the production of this book; in most cases the database upheld the authors' analysis, but a few errors were revealed which had to be corrected. Another interesting tool for analysing king and pawn endings is a program written by Lars Rasmussen of Denmark. This program requires you to feed in a pawn-structure, and then it generates a database based on that pawn-structure and all derivative structures resulting from pawn moves and/or captures. This program has some limitations, the main one being that it is currently unable to evaluate any queen endings which might result. Thus it works best in positions which are unlikely to lead to a queen ending (e.g., endings with all the pawns on one side). Its great advantage is that whereas the Nalimov tablebases can only cope with three pawns, the Rasmussen program will work with up to seven. I was able to check many of the positions in this book with the Rasmussen program. Once again, I found the authors' analysis to be fundamentally sound, and most of the corrections were quite minor. While computer assistance can be of help for many basic king and pawn endings, the analyst is more or less on his own when it comes to more complex situations. In the past, analysts and authors have tended to avoid tackling such messy positions and have preferred to concentrate on the basic positions, or on positions with blocked pawn-structures, which are far easier to analyse. However, the authors of this book are players rather than theoreticians, and they have ambitiously tackled a large number of complex practical examples with many pawns. The resulting analysis has been an eye-opener for me, and shows how difficult many practical king and pawn endings are. This point is reinforced by the number of errors by leading grandmasters (including resigning in a drawn position) which the authors point out. Even Garry Kasparov is shown giving away half a point in example 14.07. If the authors were ambitious in tackling such positions, their decision to write the book using the Nunn Convention shows extraordinary bravery. I must admit that I would never have dared to do this myself. The authors explain this convention in more detail later, but basically it requires the author to indicate precisely which moves throw away half a point, and which are 'only' moves. I introduced this convention in my own series of endgame books, in order to display a great deal of information in a compact form. However, in those books I had a database to hand, so in most cases I could obtain the necessary information directly from the database. By contrast, in the vast majority of cases Karsten Müller and Frank Lamprecht had to use their own brains for the same purpose. Readers may wonder if king and pawn endings are really so important, but the answer is undoubtedly that they are. Looking through this book, you will see that a lot of the examples are from recent tournament play and involve leading players - the frequency of king and pawn endings is higher than one might imagine. Even in cases where a king and pawn ending does not actually arise, the possibility of one often has a profound influence on the play. In many other types of ending, a possibility to exchange the last pieces arises. The question is whether it is better to exchange or to avoid the exchange. The subject of liquidation is an important one in over-the-board play, and the authors quite rightly devote a whole chapter to it, giving examples of both correct and misguided liquidations. This book scores a number of 'firsts' for king and pawn ending books. It is the first to use the latest computer tools for checking the analysis, where possible. There will undoubtedly still be errors, as much of the analysis could not be checked in this way, but the extra level of checking, applied to what was already very accurate analysis, should have further reduced the error rate. The strong emphasis on practical examples and over-the-board play is another 'first', and makes this book an exceptionally valuable contribution to the literature of king and pawn endings. There is even a chapter on decision-making in king and pawn endings, which is of particular relevance today as many such endings will arise in quick-play finishes. Finally, there is a high percentage of original analysis. The usual basic positions are here, of course, but these are presented less as an end in themselves and more as stepping-stones to the real content of the book. I hope this book will give other readers as much pleasure and instruction as it has given me, and provide them with further insight into the subtle beauty of pawn endings. John Nunn Chertsey, November 1999 Preface Pawn endings don't occur quite as often as rook endings but nevertheless every ambitious chess-player should make himself familiar with them. The ability to assess them quickly and correctly plays an especially important role in the case of simplifications. But don't deceive yourself, though the board may be almost empty, pawn endings are full of traps and tricks, as you will certainly have already noticed yourself. When you deal with them in more detail you will even discover a special little chess world with a beauty all of its own. The magician of this world is without doubt Nikolai Dmitrievich Grigoriev, who enchants us with his masterpieces. It is no accident that we have included many of his ideas. Such points and surprising turns have been an encouragement for us throughout our work. Also the use of the Nunn Convention (which will be explained in more detail on the following pages) in dealing with the move evaluations has not only extended the analysis but also produced some surprises. Writing this book was a real matter of teamwork, since each position was analysed by both authors. In this connection we want to express our special thanks to Carl-Christian Buhr, Holger Hebbinghaus, Peter and Stefan Kühn, Werner Müller, Martin Voigt, Georg von Bülow, Christian Wilhelmi, and Claus Dieter Meyer, a trainer in Hamburg for many years, for their many suggestions, analyses and corrections, and Bob Baker, M.Garraffo, Julian Zimmermann and Garth Sylbing for spotting errors in the first edition. Special thanks also go to the ChessBase company, who made it feasible for us to write the book with their program ChessBase for Windows, their databases, the analysis module Fritz 4, the new program Hiarcs 7.32 using the K+2P vs K+P tablebase and the Endgame CD-ROM by Ken Thompson and to Gambit Publications, especially to John Nunn and Graham Burgess for their good cooperation. Though careful work has been done, some mistakes are unavoidable and we offer thanks in advance for any corrections. Karsten Müller, Frank Lamprecht Hamburg, November 1999 Introduction When one thinks about books on pawn endings, the book by Averbakh, the Encyclopaedia (ECE) and several standard works with separate chapters on pawn endings come to one's mind immediately. Why does it make sense to add another one? Both authors have many years of experience as chess trainers and grew tired of putting together motifs and themes afresh every time they were required. Therefore our work is primarily conceived as a textbook. The first twelve chapters are in a way the 'basics of pawn endings'. Each one of them builds a separate unit, consisting of explanations and exercises. Chapter 13 deals with general thinking methods in chess on the basis of pawn endings. In Chapter 14 you will find some difficult examples and ideas for your own analysis. That pawn endings don't come out of the blue is documented by Chapter 15. There various aspects of simplification will be discussed. The book is concluded by a final selection of exercises covering all the previous chapters. Those who like things expressed concisely are referred to the 'crash course' after this introduction. Otherwise, you should of course study the examples in each chapter first and then test your own understanding with the help of the exercises. If you are able to solve all the exercises correctly while lying in your bed in the evening you had better give the book away; if not, a chessboard will certainly help you. In this sense we believe we can offer the beginner the necessary knowledge as well as offering masters many new things. ◼ Where applicable, we have created rules and principles to help orientate the reader. Since they are formulated in a highly general way, their interpretation demands a good deal of 'good will' to avoid them being distorted into something absurd. Crash Course This page is written for those readers who want to acquire the most important basics as quickly as possible. Of course this book would not be so voluminous if things were so easy. The beginner is unlikely to master the subject from this brief presentation; the expert on the other hand will hardly discover anything new.

The Nunn Convention We have defined the following move evaluations according to the system introduced by John Nunn: ! The only move that does not change the result of the position without regard to possible repetitions of the position. We interpret this in such a way that every move that leads to a position that has to be reached if the defender plays accordingly gets an exclamation mark. (Except that if there is just one legal move it doesn't get an exclamation mark). !! A particularly beautiful or hard-to-find exclamation-mark move ? A move that changes the result of the position in a negative way ?? An obvious or very unfortunate question-mark move !? A move that makes one's task easier or that causes problems for the opponent ?! A move with which you cause difficulties for yourself or that makes it too easy for the opponent To illustrate the convention, we present the following triangulation from Chapter 5:
1 Kd5!
All other moves lose the c6-pawn; therefore this is obviously the only move that keeps a winning position.
1...Kc8!?
This forces White to play precisely. 1...Kd8?! makes White's task easier: 2 Kd6! +-.
2 Kd4
This move doesn't get an exclamation mark because the triangulation can also be initiated by 2 Kc4 (a disadvantage of the Nunn Convention).
2...Kd8 3 Kc4
Again no exclamation mark because one could play 3 Kd5 Kc8 4 Kc4.
3...Kc8 4 Kd5!
Here an exclamation mark is necessary because White has to bring about this position in any case if he wants to win (it doesn't matter if the king comes from c4 or d4).
4...Kc7
4...Kd8 5 Kd6! Kc8 6 c7! Kb7 7 Kd7! Ka7 8 Kc6 +- (8 c8Q?? stalemate).
5 Kc5! Kc8 6 Kb6! Kb8 7 Kxa6!
After 7 c7+? it's only a draw: 7...Kc8! 8 Kxa6 Kxc7! =.
7...Kc7 8 Kb5! +-
It remains to comment that there is no endgame tablebase available for most of the positions in this book so that, unlike Dr Nunn, we have a further potential source of errors! Other Signs and Symbols +- White is winning +/- White is clearly better and should win += White is a little bit better but his advantage shouldn't be enough for a win = The position is equal or drawn =+ Black is a little bit better but his advantage shouldn't be enough for a win -/+ Black is clearly better and should win -+ Black is winning In the diagrams there are the following symbols:

★ a key square
[diagram]
still be read. Figures like 1, 1a mark the corresponding squares. Under the diagrams you can find signs of the following type: +/= The sign before the slash shows the assessment from the white perspective with White to move, while the sign after the slash shows the assessment from the black perspective with Black to move. +/= thus means that White to move wins and Black to move draws. /- means that Black to move loses. With White to move the position is either senseless (the black king could be in check, for example) or not interesting for us. In the exercises +, = or - will be replaced by one to five stars, depending on the level of difficulty: * easy ** medium *** difficult **** very difficult ***** extremely difficult For example ***/ means that White is to move in this difficult exercise but you are not asked to consider the position with Black to move. */*** signifies that with White to play it is an easy exercise, while the Black-to-play case is difficult. In the exercises, it is up to the reader to determine whether the task of the side to move is to win or to draw.

Some subsidiary positions are given without a diagram. The method of displaying these is easiest to explain by means of an example. In a later note you will find the position (wKc2,Pb2,e5; bKd5,Pa4) - this means that White has a king on c2, and pawns on b2 and e5, while Black has a king on d5 and a pawn on a4. The white pieces are always given first, starting with the king; pieces of the same type are separated by a comma (as with the two white pawns in the above example). Publisher's Note Welcome to the Kindle version of Secrets of Pawn Endings. By and large, this edition follows the structure of the printed book, but some comments are in order regarding a few differences. In the exercise sections, a repeated diagram appears at the start of the solution. In addition, a diagram may be repeated in cases where there is extensive analysis of both the White-to-move and Black-to-move cases. There are also a great many hyperlinks in the text, making it easy to find relevant cross-references and related material. Note that double-tapping on a diagram makes it possible to see it at a larger size (precisely how this works depends on what device you are using); this may be especially useful for the exercises. Occasionally, the authors provide a position in shorthand form (e.g. "wKd1,Pa2,h3; bKd5,Pa3,h4"), generally when it is an aside, and including a diagram would have broken the flow of the discussion. In this Kindle edition, this has been changed into a link to a diagram that can be found at the end of the book, so you can examine the position more easily, or focus on the main discussion, as you prefer. At the time Karsten and Frank wrote Secrets of Pawn Endings, the five-man tablebase for K+2P vs K+P had only just become available, together with the first generation of engines that could use this type of tablebase in their search. In the intervening years, the full set of six-man tablebases (most notably for this book K+2P vs K+2P) has been completed, providing ready answers to questions that Karsten and Frank could only tackle with immense effort and using the engines and tablebases that were available to them at the time. For the 2007 Gambit edition, six-man positions that occur in the text were checked against the new tablebases, and any necessary amendments - which were remarkably small in number, and mostly of a 'minor detail' nature - were made. These amendments are naturally also included in this Kindle edition. For this new 2014 edition, a further round of checking was performed, using a larger collection of tablebases and modern engines. As before, this mostly revealed small matters of detail, rather than undermining any overall conclusions. The positions featuring significant revisions are: 8.16, 8.17, 9.04,
10.05, 10.13, 11.11, A11.06, A11.07, 12.12 and C16.06.
Graham Burgess Woodbury, Minnesota October 2014 1: King and Pawn(s) vs King At first we will examine the endgame king and pawn vs king with the bishop's pawn, but all our results are also valid for the central and the knight's pawns. Some positions with rook's pawns will follow. Problems with the realization of two extra pawns will then in particular round off the exercises. Important themes are, among others, key squares and connected to them the opposition (also distant, side, diagonal and virtual opposition), simple and reciprocal zugzwang and the square rule, which is also the subject of our first example: The Rule of the Square The white king is too far away to support his pawn. Therefore everything depends on the right to move. If White is to move, he can directly queen his pawn: 1 f6! Kc5 2 f7! Kd6 3 f8Q+ +- If it is Black to move, he is able to capture the pawn:
1...Kc5! 2 f6 Kd6! 3 f7 Ke7! 4 f8Q+ Kxf8! =
The superimposed square that encloses the pawn's diagonal to the 8th rank serves as a visual aid. Square rule: if the king is in the square of the pawn (passed pawn) or if he can step into it, then he can capture the pawn. If not, the pawn can be queened without being supported by its own king. A1.01 (i.e. exercise 1.01) shows a logical exception. In case there are still several pawns left on the board, one has to look out for possibilities to block the king from its way into the square (see A1.03). We have seen that the black king captures the pawn when it is able to get into the square of the pawn. But what happens if the white king supports his pawn? We start with the most straightforward case: From e7 White protects the pawn's way to the 8th rank. Therefore it doesn't matter where the black king is placed. We describe the e7-square as a key square of the f6-pawn. Definition: a square is described as a key square when its occupation by the king secures the win (in this case the queening of the f-pawn), no matter who is to move. One notices at once that g7 is also a key square. From f7 the white king can move to either e7 or g7. Therefore f7 is also a key square. The same applies for the squares e8, f8 and g8. Of course Black then mustn't be able to capture the pawn. So we have determined the six key squares of the f6-pawn: But what if the black king blocks the direct way to the key squares? Here everything depends on the right to move. If White is to move, he can't make any progress: 1 f7+ Nor does it help if White retreats with his king: 1 Ke5!? Kf7 2 Kf5 Kf8! 3 Kg6 Kg8! 4 Kf5 Kf7 5 Ke5 Kf8! 6 Ke6 Ke8! and White hasn't achieved anything.
1...Kf8! 2 Kf6 stalemate
If it is Black to move, he loses because the white king gets to the key square e7.
1...Kf8
1...Kd8 2 f7 +-.
2 f7! (D) Black is now forced to play ...Kg7 (the pawn advances to the 7th rank without a check). White to move would have to stalemate, as we have seen before, or give up the pawn.
2...Kg7 3 Ke7! +-
In position 1.03 it was disadvantageous for both sides to have to move. Definition: We talk about zugzwang, when the mere fact that one side is to move (has to move) leads to a disadvantage. In other words, to pass on the right to move would be by far the best move. It follows that 1.03 shows a reciprocal zugzwang, in contrast to the example we have discussed in the introduction (0.01; later 5.08), where Black, no matter who is to move, gets into (simple) zugzwang. Zugzwang situations play an important role in nearly all types of endgames, but in pawn endings they appear particularly often. With the useful question: "What would my opponent do, if he were to move?" zugzwang situations are often easier to identify. Of course it also helps to detect threats. Back to the key squares: The following five diagrams show the key squares of the f-pawn in various stages of advancement: A rule of thumb: if the pawn has crossed the middle of the board he has got six key squares; if he is still on his side of the board he only has three. The following two positions will establish that: The white king has occupied a key square. The right to move thus doesn't matter. If White is to move, he uses the zugzwang known from position 1.03: 1 f6 Kf8 2 f7! +-. If Black is to move, he must allow the white king to the 7th rank: 1...Kf8 2 Kf6! (but not 2 f6? Ke8! 3 f7+ Kf8! 4 Kf6 stalemate) 2...Ke8 3 Kg7! +-. If the king doesn't occupy a key square it is always a draw when the pawn advances to the 7th rank with check. Here White cannot make use of the zugzwang position 1.03. Therefore White to move can only achieve a draw if the black king defends the key squares on the sixth rank: 1 Kf5 Kf7! 2 Kg5 Kg7! 3 f5 Kf7! 4 f6 Kf8! 5 Kg6 Kg8! =. If Black is to move, he loses control over the key squares and thus the game:
1...Kf7 2 Kf5! Ke7 3 Kg6! Kf8 4 Kf6 Kg8 5 Ke7 Kg7 6 f5 +-.
The two kings face each other at e5/e7 in 1.06 and that is called opposition. The opposition is the most important means in the fight for three adjacent key squares. Whoever loses the opposition also loses the fight for the key squares. Let's have a quick look at the most frequent forms of opposition: When one talks about opposition, most often this vertical form of opposition is meant. If it is Black to move, White has the distant opposition on the e-file. If the aim is to reach one of the critical squares e6, f6, g6 (thus the main file is the f-file), the first step is to have the distant opposition on the main file. In a second step it will then be transformed into the simple opposition. After 1...Kf8 2 Kf4! Ke8 3 Kg5! Kf7 4 Kf5! White gets at first the normal opposition and after 4...Ke7 5 Kg6! one of the critical squares. The following forms of opposition will only later be of importance (you will, for example, find them in exercise A4.04): Black to move has to allow either the near or the side opposition:
1...Kf7
Or 1...Ke6 2 Kg6! Ke7 3 Kg7!.
2 Kf5! Ke7 3 Ke5!
We speak of opposition in general when the square around the kings has corners of the same colour. (Note: all four corners must have the same colour!). The following two examples show the battle for the key squares, when the kings are still far away. In the first one it is possible to defend them: S.Gligorić - R.J.Fischer Yugoslavia Candidates 1959 Black can easily cover the key squares if he can prevent his opponent from getting the (near) opposition. Due to the b4-pawn he can't get the distant opposition on the main file (1.07B).
1...Kb8!
1...Kc7? 2 Kc5! +-; 1...Kb7? 2 Kb5! +-.
2 Kc5
2 Kd5 would be the right move if the key squares were b6, c6 and d6, but here it
doesn't do any good due to 2...Kb7! =.
2...Kc7! 3 Kb5 Kb7! 4 Ka5 Ka7! and Black draws.
The second example is of fundamental importance and should be studied carefully, because it shows how the attacker should proceed with a pawn that is not far advanced: Drtina Casopis cesky sahistu, 1908 White is able to occupy the fourth rank in three moves. However, only by advancing to b4 can he avoid Black getting the opposition (it takes four moves to reach b6!).
1 Kc2! Ke7 2 Kb3! Kd6 3 Kb4! Kc6 4 Kc4! Kd6 5 Kb5!
White has occupied a key square and in the following moves he captures still more space before he finally advances his pawn.
5...Kc7 6 Kc5!
6 c4?? (don't forget: if the pawn moves, the key squares change!) 6...Kb7! 7 Kc5 Kc7! 8 Kd5 Kd7! 9 c5 Kc7! 10 c6 Kc8! 11 Kd6 Kd8! 12 c7+ Kc8! 13 Kc6 leads only to stalemate.
6...Kd7 7 Kb6!
White has captured a key square of the c4-pawn (which is also a key square if the pawn advances to c5) and can finally advance his pawn:
7...Kd6 8 c4! Kd7 9 c5! Kc8 10 Kc6! Kd8 11 Kb7! Kd7 12 c6+! +-
Before we get to the rook's pawn, yet another rule of thumb: The position is drawn if the defender's king is able to occupy one of the two squares in front of the pawn (the only exception is 1.03 with Black to move), as then he can always successfully defend the key squares. From the attacker's point of view, the following rule might also help: one wins when at least two of the following three criteria are fulfilled: 1) King in front of the pawn; 2) Opposition; 3) King on the 6th (or 3rd) rank. With the rook's pawn the winning prospects go down considerably: If the defending king gets in front of the pawn all winning efforts are in vain.
1...Kh8 2 h6 Kg8 3 h7+ Kh8! =
Black is also able to draw if he succeeds in blocking the white king on the edge:
1...Kf6! 2 Kh7
The position after 2 Kh7 would also be drawn with White to move: 1 h6 Kf7! =,
1 Kh6 Kf7! =, 1 Kg8 Kg5! =.
2...Kf7! 3 Kh8 Kf8 4 Kh7 Kf7! 5 h6 Kf8! 6 Kg6
By moving the pawn, White could get away from the edge but now the black king reaches the saving queening square.
6...Kg8! 7 h7+ Kh8! =
White to move would have occupied one of the two key squares of the rook's pawn with 1 Kg7 and queened it. From our considerations we can draw the following important rule: Black can always draw vs the white h-pawn if he manages to reach the f8-square (or c8 with the a-pawn or f1 or c1 with a black rook's pawn) with his king. He then gets into the corner or he can block the white king. This rule makes a quick evaluation a lot easier. However, it does have a (trivial) exception: If White is to move, he wins with 1 h7! +-. The following position illustrates the battle for the key squares of the rook's pawn: O.Panno - M.Najdorf Buenos Aires 1968 White, to move, wins by occupying the key square g7:
1 Kg5 1-0
In view of 1...Kd7 2 Kg6 Ke7 (2...Ke6 3 h4 {after 3 Kg7?? Kf5! = Black captures the pawn} 3...Ke7 4 Kg7! +-) 3 Kg7! Ke6 4 h4! Kf5 5 h5! and White wins. If Black were to move, he would draw easily by getting his king to the saving square f8: 1...Kd7 2 Kg5 Ke7 3 Kg6 Kf8! 4 h4 (4 Kh7 Kf7! =) 4...Kg8! =. Normally two or more pawns win easily, though sometimes one has to be sacrificed in order to occupy the key squares of the remaining pawn. You will find some examples in this chapter's exercises. Even doubled pawns usually win:
1 Kf5!
1 f5? would be a serious mistake since White still needs the back pawn for a tempo (remember: a pawn move can't be reversed). After this Black manages to draw similarly to 1.03: 1...Kf8! 2 Ke6 Ke8! 3 f7+ Kf8! 4 f6 stalemate.

Chapter 1 Exercises Before you dive into the jungle of exercises, some remarks are appropriate. The positions are not ordered by their level of difficulty (number of stars) but after the themes that occur in the chapter. There doesn't always exist one clear solution; it's rather sometimes a particular idea or the right plan that should be discovered. In odd cases the exercise might even be 'unsolvable'. Then it would be sufficient to assess the position correctly. Pawn endings are very suitable to train the calculation of variations. Even though it demands a great deal of concentration, you should therefore not stop your calculations before you have determined your verdict. solution solution solution solution solution solution solution solution solution solution solution solution solution Find all combinations of three adjacent squares (horizontal or vertical) that can be defended by the black king. Which ones can be defended by the white king? solution Solutions to Chapter 1 Exercises It seems that the black king is in the square of the pawn. However, if the pawn is still in its starting position, then you have to watch out for the possibility of a double step when applying the square rule: 1 a4! Kf4 2 a5! Ke5 3 a6! Kd6 4 a7!

back I.Rogers - E.Levi Canberra 1996 Actually we deal with these kind of positions in Chapter 3 (race of the pawns) but here the main question is whether Black has to stop the h-pawn (by moving via f8 into the square) or whether he can engage in a race with 1...b5. We assume that you have noticed that White wins after 1...b5? because he is in the square of the pawn after 2 h5!, while Black isn't in the square of the h5-pawn.

back All vertical combinations of three squares between the 6th and 8th ranks can be defended. We haven't come across an example for that yet but, as we will see later, this might also be of importance. With all horizontal combinations Black is lost though, e.g. with a7, b7, c7:
1...Kd8 2 Kd2! Kc8 3 Kc2! Kb8 4 Kb2!
Gaining the distant opposition on the main file!
4...Kc8 5 Ka3! Kc7 6 Ka4! Kb8 7 Kb4! Ka8 8 Kc5! Kb7 9 Kb5! Kc7 10 Ka6!
Kb8 11 Kb6! Kc8 12 Ka7! White has achieved his aim. With White defending, on the other hand, White is able to defend all squares (!!) up to the 5th rank because he has the distant opposition. back 2: King and Pawn vs King and Pawn Now that Chapter 1 has described the situation when one side has no pawns at all, we now look at positions with one pawn on each side. To get used to the basic techniques we first look at positions without passed pawns, which means that the pawns are on the same file or on adjacent files (Chapter 3 is dedicated to the race of the passed pawns). Thereby the term key square will be expanded to critical square and we will have a closer look at the special geometry of the board, in which connection we advise the reader to concentrate particularly on the study by Grigoriev (2.05). A) Pawns on the Same File B) Pawns on Adjacent Files A) Pawns on the Same File Since there are no passed pawns, the winning plan consists of two steps: 1) The opponent's pawn must be captured; 2) A key square of one's own pawn must be occupied. The following position is in a way critical: Whoever is to move captures the opponent's pawn, but only for White is this enough to win because by taking the pawn he simultaneously occupies a key square of the f5-pawn:
1 Kd5!
Opposition!
1...Ke7 2 Kc6! Ke8 3 Kd6! Kf7 4 Kd7! Kf8 5 Ke6! Kg7 6 Ke7! Kg8 7 Kxf6!
+- (1.05) This line shows that Black can't defend his pawn any longer after he has to allow White access to c6. This means that the squares c6, d6 and e6 are critical squares of the f6-pawn (their occupation by the white king leads to the loss of the pawn). With blocked pawns the critical squares are always those three directly beside the pawn. For White the critical squares of the f6-pawn are simultaneously key squares since winning the pawn automatically means winning the game. If it is Black to move, things are different. It is true that the black king can, with the help of the opposition, advance to the critical squares of the f5-pawn (c5, d5, e5) but this is not enough for a win because the white king is able to defend the key squares of the f6-pawn: 1...Kd6
2 Ke4 Kc5 3 Ke3 Kd5 4 Kf4 Kd4 5 Kf3 Ke5 6 Kg4 Ke4 7 Kg3!. If Black takes
the pawn, the white king has to move to f3 to get the opposition! 7...Kxf5 8 Kf3! = (1.06). The fight for the critical squares (key squares) might begin at their most far away access: Here it starts on the a-file:
1 Ka5!
1 Kb5? Kb7! =.
1...Kb7 2 Kb5! Kc7 3 Kc5! Kd7 4 Kd5! Ke7 5 Ke5!
5 Kc6?? Ke6! -+.
5...Kf7 6 Kd6! +- (2.01)
If both sides occupy the critical squares directly near the pawn simultaneously, a situation of reciprocal zugzwang exists and the reader should certainly memorize it due to its great practical importance: Whoever is to move loses. With White to play: 1 Kh4 Kxf4! 2 Kh3 Kf3 -+. With Black to play: 1...Kd5 2 Kxf5! Kd6 3 Kf6 +-. With the kings one square aside it's just the opposite: Whoever is to move wins! White to play: 1 Kg6! (1 Kg5?? Ke4! -+) 1...Ke4 2 Kg5! +- (2.03). Black to play: 1...Ke3! 2 Kg5 Ke4! -+. We are now ready for the following position: End of a study by N.Grigoriev Shakhmatny listok, 1931 Pure counting shows that White loses if he tries to capture the black pawn. White gets to c7 in five moves (aiming for c8 fails because the b6-pawn wouldn't be protected), but at this very moment Black would move to a6, whereafter White loses due by 2.03. It follows that White loses the b6-pawn in any case. So he must try to defend the key squares of the black b-pawn (a5, b5, c5). Actually after ...Kxb6 he has to play Kb4. Since every tempo counts (Black needs five moves to capture the pawn; White needs six moves to get to b4, but he is to move), White must be careful that the black king doesn't hinder him on his way. This is called 'shouldering away' the king.
1 Kg3!!
White takes a curve to get to b4! Not 1 Kg4? Kc2!: a) 2 Kf3 Kd3!. Shouldering away! White needs one more move to get to b4 and loses, e.g. 3 Kf2 Kc4 4 Ke3 Kc5 5 Kd3 Kxb6! 6 Kc4 Ka5! -+. b) 2 Kf4 Kd3! 3 Ke5 Kc4! 4 Kd6 Kb5! 5 Kc7 Ka6! -+ (2.03).

Kb5 8 Kc3! Kc5 9 Kb3! Kxb6 10 Kb4! = (1.06) ◼ The study goes: wKh4,Rc8,Pb5; bKa1,Pb3,b7,c5. White to move draws by 1 b6!! b2! 2 Ra8+! Kb1 3 Rc8! Ka2 4 Rxc5!. Geometry of the Chess Board It's worth going into this theme in more detail. The idea of shouldering away (the kings try to keep each other from achieving their aims) appears very frequently in endgames. One should therefore be aware of an important feature of the chessboard, its special geometry: From our schooldays we know that the shortest connection between two points is a straight line. For the king on the chessboard this rule is only valid for the diagonals. Obviously White has only one possibility to get to e1 in three moves. But should the king, as in 2.05, wish to get to b4 in six moves, White has 141 different routes to choose from, if one doesn't pay attention to the black king. Those are rarely all of the same value. Often it's the outside curve, sometimes only a zigzag course, that leads to success. You should therefore always carefully consider which route is best. After the short trip to the geometry of the chessboard we now want to examine positions with pawns that are not yet blocked: L'Hermet - Johnsteyn corr. 1877 The pawn can't be defended in the long run. Thus the battle for the key squares has to be won: 1 c4! Not 1 Kd2? c4! 2 Kd1 c3! and Black wins.
1...Kc3 2 Kc1! Kd4 3 Kd2
3 Kc2?? Kxc4! -+ (1.06).
3...Kxc4 4 Kc2! = (1.06)
J.Kling and B.Horwitz, 1851 White's king is very active, but he still isn't able to win. 1 e3
1 e4 Kd8 2 Kf7 e5! = (2...Kd7? 3 e5! Kd8 4 e6! +-).
1...Kd8 2 e4 Ke8! 3 e5 Kd8 4 Kf7 Kd7! 5 Kf8
5 e6+?? Kd6! -+.
5...Ke6! 6 Ke8! =
2.08 would also be a draw with Black to move. After 1...Kd8 we would more or
less have the same play. After considering the above, the following difficult study might be mastered: N.Grigoriev, 1938 Even though White's king isn't well placed, he still manages to draw. However, he has to watch out for both methods of defence (attack against the black pawn and defending his own pawn, or the key squares) to be successful:
1 Kg5! Ke4 2 Kf6! Kd5 3 Ke7! Kc6
3...b5 4 Kd7! b4 5 Kc7! Kc5 6 Kb7! b3 (6...Kb5 7 b3! =) 7 Ka6! =.
4 Ke6!
Only that way! The attempt to play on for a counter-attack fails: 4 Kd8? b5! 5 Kc8 (5 Ke7 b4 6 Ke6 Kc5! 7 Ke5 Kc4! 8 Kd6 b3! -+) 5...b4! 6 Kb8 b3 -+.
4...b6 5 Ke5! Kc5 6 Ke4! Kc4 7 Ke3! b5

8 Kd2! Kb3 9 Kc1! Ka2 10 b4! Kb3 11 Kb1! = (2.07)
◼ A couple of other placements of the kings have also been examined; for example, White loses with wKh5 vs bKf4 (Grigoriev 1938, ECE 61, Av 62) no matter who is to move and White wins with wKa1 vs bKh1 by 1 Kb1! (Moravec 1940, ECE 62, Av 63). Proceeding from Moravec, Verburg in 1987 placed the bK at f1 and moved the pawn from b7 to b5 (1 Kb1! Ke2 2 Kc2! Ke3 3 Kc3! +-). We now get to the rook's pawn: Schlage - Ahues Berlin 1921 Black's defensive idea, to block the white king at the edge of the board, is already known from Chapter 1. However, White manages to avoid the blocking of his king by using the geometry of the chessboard and shouldering away the black king:
1 Ke6! Kc3 2 Kd5!
(Maizelis). The game actually continued 2 Kd6? Kd4! 3 Kc6 Ke5! 4 Kb7 Kd6! 5 Kxa7 Kc7! = and was drawn.

When there are still pawn moves available, the winning chances are less because the defender has more time on his side: Faas - Novikov
USSR 1976
White can easily draw, even though his king is far away:
1...a5
1...Kb4 2 Kd7 (2 Ke7 =; 2 Kd8 =) 2...a5 3 Kc6 a4 4 Kd5! Ka3 5 Kc4 Kxa2 6

5 Kd4! Kxa2 6 Kc3! = 1⁄2-1⁄2 (1.11)
B) Pawns on Adjacent Files In this case the drawing chances for the defender are higher. The draw is already assured if his own pawn is protected or the opponent's pawn is attacked: O.Panno - R.Silva Nazzari Pinamar (team event) 1975
1...Kb4!
Black's own pawn can't be defended any longer. Therefore he has to go for a counter-attack. 1...Kb6? 2 Kd6! (shouldering away) 2...Kb5 3 Ke7! leads to a win for White.

The second important defence is the sacrifice of the pawn followed by a defence of the key squares: End of a study by P.Duclos, 1903 1 d6!
1 Kb3? Kc5! and now:

1...cxd6 2 Kb3! Kc5 3 Kc3! = (1.06)
Of course this is not always possible: R.Bianchetti Contributo alla teoria di finali di sol, 1925 White can make the pawn sacrifice worthless:

The pawns could also be placed at g2 and f4, when the result would stay the same (though then 1 Kg4 would also win), but not at b2 and a4 because in this case Black could draw after 1 Kh4 Kg6 2 Kg4 with 2...a3. ◼ Also look at Adamson 1915 (ECE 84, Av 75) wKc8,Pg2; bKa7,Ph6: 1 Kc7!

◼ By the way, this example has an interesting story, which is told explicitly by Averbakh (who attributes it to Maizelis). In 1884 a position with the same idea (wKc2,Pb2,e5; bKd5,Pa4) was investigated, and "a certain Dr Kassidi showed the right way to win". Also Horwitz used this finish, while A2.08 shows the version from Tattersall's collection. Some other authors ascribe this study to Dedrle, who uses it in one of his articles (1921) without giving a source. back J.Moravec Československý Šach, 1952 Of course you have seen the pawn sacrifice f6 but hopefully you haven't carried it out immediately.

back 3: Race of the Passed Pawns In the following chapters there will again and again be lines that end with a race between passed pawns. This chapter provides the basics for a quick evaluation of such variations. Since queen endings actually don't belong in the framework of this book we only will deal with complicated queen endings when they emerge from our chosen pawn endings. We deal with three issues: A) Both Sides Queen a Pawn B) Queen against Pawn(s) C) Transition into a Pawn Ending A) Both Sides Queen a Pawn Here we consider cases where the game ends with an early mate, the loss of a queen or with a dead draw. The following diagram shows the position shortly before a vertical or diagonal skewer (of course one could also imagine a horizontal skewer): White would win by 1 Qa8+! Kb6 2 Qb8+! +-. If Black is to play, he captures the white queen by 1...Qb3+ or 1...Qa2+. But back to pawn endings: A.Mandler Narodni Osvobozeni, 1938 The white king is more active and he is to move. However, the immediate pawn- race leads to a draw, as does taking the pawn. Since also the blockade of the pawn (Kb6) doesn't achieve anything, using the method of exclusion (see
13.01/02) - without having calculated all consequences - only Kd6 remains as a
candidate with which White keeps an eye on both pawns. (Be careful: of course one has to make sure that Kd6 doesn't lose immediately. During the game you don't know at once that this position is won for White.)

The king manoeuvre Kc4-c3 deserves special attention since it forces the black king to the fatal square a3, so as then to queen with check. We will meet similar ideas quite often. We want to draw your attention once again to the key move of Mandler's study,
1 Kd6!!. Thereby White protected his pawn's way and was simultaneously able
to attack the black pawn. Thus he pursued two aims with one move. Regarding this important issue there exists a famous study which we don't want to deny you: R.Réti Kagans Neueste Schachnachrichten, 1921 It seems that the white position is hopeless. The c-pawn can't be supported and the square of the h-pawn is out of reach, or is it? Let's see.
1 Kg7! h4 2 Kf6!
White is now threatening to support his pawn with his king.
2...Kb6
2...h3 3 Ke7 =.
3 Ke5!!
A sort of double attack. Black can't stop White either entering the square of the h-pawn or promoting his c-pawn.
3...h3
3...Kxc6 4 Kf4 =.
4 Kd6! h2 5 c7! h1Q 6 c8Q! and White draws.
Maybe this masterpiece will encourage you to look for an escape route if you are in an apparently hopeless position. By the way, Black would win in the original position if his king were on a7. In that case, instead of 2...Kb6, he plays 2...Kb8!. ◼ This motif, which the study composer Gurvich called 'The Hunt of Two Hares', appears in quite a few other studies and games (!) (see Averbakh 95- 103), from which we select just two: de Feijter (1939, ECE 125, Av 102) wKa8,Pf4; bKb5,Pa6: 1 Kb7! a5 2 Kc7! Kc5 3 Kd7! Kd5 4 Ke7! Ke4 5 Ke6! = and Prokeš (1946, ECE 126, Av 99) wKg8,Pf3; bKh4,Pa6: 1 Kf7! a5 2 f4! a4 3 f5! a3 4 f6! a2 5 Kg8! = (3.08). In Mandler's study (3.02) the position of the black king at the edge of the board was fatal because White was able to direct him in such a way that the f-pawn could queen with check. Uncomfortable king and queen positions are characteristic for mate ideas: After Polerio, 1590
1 Qb6+! Ka3 2 Qa5+! Kb2 3 Qb4+! Ka2
3...Kc1 4 Qd2+! Kb1 5 Qc2#!.
4 Kc2! +-
◼ This idea was discovered by Polerio as long ago as 1590 and illustrated in the study wKe2,Pa2; bKg2,Pc7,h7, when Black to move loses because the a-pawn queens with check and the position of Black's pieces at the edge of the board will be fatal for him. Again a study makes the idea clear: J.Fritz Svobodne slovo, 1954 By threatening to capture the h-pawn, White directs the black king into the dangerous corner:
1 Kd5! h5 2 Ke4!
2 Ke5? Ke3! =.
2...Kf2 3 Kf4! Kg2 4 c5!

Mate can't be avoided. B) Queen vs Pawn(s) Normally a pawn can only be a threat to a queen when it is on the 7th (2nd) rank and is supported by its king. Then the outcome depends upon the king of the stronger side, whether he can support his queen himself. It is critical which file the passed pawn is on. We start with a central pawn:
1 Qd7+
The first step in the winning process is to bring the queen closer to the enemy pawn.
1...Kc2 2 Qa4+ Kd2
2...Kd3 3 Qb4 and Qe1. If the queen gets in front of the pawn she actually wins
every time.
3 Qd4+ Kc2 4 Qe3! Kd1 5 Qd3+!
The critical moment. White forces the black king in front of the pawn and thus wins time to get his king nearer the pawn.
5...Ke1 6 Kb7 Kf2 7 Qd4+ Kf1 8 Qf4+ Kg2 9 Qe3! Kf1 10 Qf3+!
The manoeuvre repeats itself.

Kd2 22 Qd3+ Ke1 23 Kf3 +- In this case it didn't matter how far the king was away from the pawn. However, it would only be a draw if the king had been at d5, d6 or d7. Then he would make the approach of the queen impossible. With a knight's pawn the same winning method can be applied. But with a rook's or bishop's pawn there are often difficulties: White only wins because his king is within the winning zone.
1 Qb4+
1 Qf2+ Kb1 (1...Kb3 2 Qd4 +-) 2 Kb4 wins more quickly.
1...Kc2 2 Qa3 Kb1 3 Qb3+ Ka1
White has managed to force the king in front of the pawn. Because of stalemate, the white king can't support in the usual way, but White can use a mate idea that is already familiar to us.
4 Qd1+ Kb2 5 Kb4 a1Q 6 Qd2+! Kb1 7 Kb3! +-
If you look at the zone carefully you will notice that the white king will either get in two moves to b3 or in one to d3 or d2 to force mate at c2. A stalemate defence is also possible with a bishop's pawn:
1 Qb4+ Ka2 2 Qc3 Kb1! 3 Qb3+ Ka1! 4 Qc3+
4 Qxc2 stalemate.
4...Kb1! 5 Qd3 Kb2 6 Qe2!? Ka1! =
6...Kb1? 7 Kb4 c1Q 8 Kb3! wins for White.
The zone makes it clear that White only wins if his king gets to b3 or d2 in one move. If the defending king is on the other side of the pawn, the winning zone will be a lot bigger. This is because White wins another tempo by forcing the king in front of the pawn. Also there might be mate ideas on the right side.

Qa2#! The reader can see for himself how White wins if he starts, for example, with his king on g4 (A3.06). If the pawn hasn't yet reached the 7th (2nd) rank there are seldom problems in winning, but no rule is without exception: Chess World, 1865 White's own king is in the queen's way and therefore White can't prevent the black pawn from advancing to the 2nd rank:
1 Qh1+ Kb2! 2 Qb7+ Kc1! 3 Kf6 c2! 4 Ke5 Kd2

The outcome of the endgame 'queen vs pawns' depends more on the concrete position than on general principles. You will find some further examples in the exercises. It should also be mentioned that the queen might even lose against several dangerous passed pawns. C) Transition into a Pawn Ending If the side with the queen still has a pawn, then often an exchange of queens or a queen sacrifice with a transition into a pawn ending again leads to victory. Y.Nesterov - K.Zolnierowicz Katowice 1993 Both passed pawns queen at the same time and the queen ending with the rook's pawn would only be a draw. But instead White can force the exchange of queens:
1 Ke5! Kc3

back After N.Grigoriev Hopefully you haven't thought for too long to find a win for White - because there is none since the white queen doesn't have access to the g4-square. By the way, the position would also be a draw with the pawn at h4 instead of h5 (then the g3-square is missing).

back 4: Small Number of Pawns Since Chapter 2 has dealt with king and pawn vs king and pawn, we now deal with positions in which one side has two pawns and the other one, but we have excluded rooks' pawns due to the many special cases (Chapter 5 is dedicated to them). In the following we mostly deal with the opposition. But sometimes this restricted way of looking at it is not sufficient and we have to use the more general theory of corresponding squares in anticipation of Chapter 12. A) Blocked Pair of Pawns and a Passed Pawn B) Protected Passed Pawn C) Backward Pawn D) Others E) Doubled Pawns A) Blocked Pair of Pawns and a Passed Pawn Here the attacker usually wins by sacrificing his passed pawn in order to capture the last of the opponent's pawns. This deflection of the defending king is only unsuccessful if a counter-attack is threatened or the pawns are very close to each other. We start with a straightforward example: White just sacrifices the g-pawn and queens the b-pawn:
1 Kf2 Kg5 2 Ke3 Kg4 3 Kd4 Kxg3 4 Kc5 Kf4 5 Kxb5 Ke5 6 Kc6 +-
If the passed pawn is only two files away from the blocked pawns, the win is more difficult or even impossible: If White is to move, he is in zugzwang because the black pawn controls the d4- square, and Black is saved by a counter-attack against the white c-pawn:
1 Kf3

3...Kd5? 4 Kf5! +-.
4 e6 c4! 5 e7 c3! 6 e8Q c2! = (3.08)
It should be noted that Black only achieved a draw here because he had a bishop's pawn. White would win if all the pieces were moved by one file. With Black to move, White wins easily: 1...Ke6 2 Kf4! Kf6 3 e5+! Ke7 (3...Ke6

+-. Drawn positions also occur when the defender's pawn is blocked on its starting point: H.Westerinen - V.Smyslov Szolnok 1975 Even though the black king gets the opposition in front of his pawn, Black isn't able to win:
1 Kc3 Ke4 2 Kd2!
White has to defend the key squares d3 and e3.
2...Kd4 3 Ke2! Kc4 4 Kd2!
4 Ke3? Kc3! 5 Ke2 (5 Ke4 Kd2! -+) 5...Kc2! 6 Ke1 (6 Ke3 Kd1! 7 Kf3 e4+ -+)
6...Kd3! 7 Kd1 Ke3 8 Ke1 e4! 9 Kf1 Kd2! -+.
4...Kd4 5 Ke2! Kc3 6 Ke3! Kc2! 7 Ke2! e4 8 Ke1!
8 Ke3? Kd1! 9 Kxe4 Ke2! -+.
8...Kd3 9 Kd1! e3 10 Ke1! e2 stalemate (1⁄2-1⁄2).
The following study illustrates typical problems with a passed pawn that is not far advanced: N.Grigoriev K novoi armii, 1920 Here the active black king causes difficulties. For a better understanding it is useful to make some preliminary considerations. White wins easily if it is Black to move in the starting position. Black has to lose control over e2 and White's king gets to e3, which enables him to win in a way that is familiar from 4.02; Black has a knight's pawn! e2, e3 and obviously also d4 are therefore key squares. From the starting position we see that Black has to answer Kd2 with ...Kf3 in order to defend the key squares. We call such a pair of squares corresponding squares. Also c3 and e3 are corresponding squares since Black has to defend d4. Since White can move from c2 to either d2 or c3, f4 is the corresponding square since from here Black can get to either f3 or e3. If we examine the adjacent squares we notice that the squares b2 and b3 (White threatens Kc3 or Kc2) only correspond with the f3-square. Because Black can't stay at f3, we have found the winning plan:
1 Kc2
1 d4? Ke4! 2 Kc3 Kf5! 3 Kd3 Kf4! is a draw.
1...Kf4
1...Ke3?! 2 Kc3! +-.
2 Kb3 Kf3 3 Kb2
Black is in zugzwang.
3...Kf4 4 Kc2!
Now White occupies the corresponding squares:
4...Ke5
4...Kf3 5 Kd2! Kf4 6 Ke2! Ke5 7 Ke3! +- transposes to the main line at move 8.
5 Kd1!
5 Kd2?! Kd4.
5...Kd5 6 Ke2 Kd4 7 Kd2! Ke5 8 Ke3! Kd5 9 d4! Kc4 10 Ke4! Kxb4 11 d5!
Kc5
11...Ka3 12 d6! +- (see 3.06); 11...Ka5 12 Ke5 b4 13 d6! Kb6 14 Ke6 b3 15 d7!
Kc7 16 Ke7! +-.
12 Ke5! b4 13 d6! Kc6 14 Ke6! b3 15 d7! b2 16 d8Q! b1Q 17 Qc8+! +-
If you are now keen to deal with the corresponding squares in detail, we can refer you to Chapter 12, where we examine this position again (12.02). B) Protected Passed Pawn The biggest advantage of a protected passed pawn is (as the description implies) that it can't be captured. Therefore the attacking king is free to manoeuvre and that's why most positions are won, but even here there are a few important exceptions. In this example White is only able to win by penetrating with his king on the queenside. Black is helpless against that because his king has to stay in the square of the protected passed c4-pawn and he doesn't have access to the b5- square.
1 Ke2
White is not able to advance on the kingside: 1 Kg2?! Kg4 2 Kh2 Kf4!? 3 Kh3 Kf5 4 Kh4 Kf4.
1...Ke5
1...Kg4 2 Kd2 Kf5 3 Kc2 Kf4 4 Kb3 Ke3 5 c5 Kxd3 6 c6! +-.
2 Kd2 Kd6 3 Kc2 Kc6 4 Kb3 Kc5 5 Ka4 Kb6 6 Kb4 Kc6 7 c5 Kd5
7...Kc7 8 Kc4 +-.
8 Kb5! +-
If you move 4.05 to the left, White cannot win (see 4.07 or A4.04). The following position is also won: Here, in contrast to 4.05, White cannot penetrate on the side of the protected passed pawn because Black is always able to answer Ka4 with ...Kb6. Still, Black can't hold the position because he has to stay in the square of the b5-pawn and he can't prevent White from advancing to the key squares of the c5-pawn. Note: if one key square is not in the square of the passed pawn, the position is lost.
1 Kf3 Kd6
1...Kf5 2 b6 +-.
2 Kf4 Ke6 3 Ke4 Kd6 4 Kf5 and White wins.
The following example shows a typical drawn position: After Walker, 1892 This position is, in contrast to 4.06, a draw since Black can either prevent the white king from penetrating or he can create sufficient counterplay against the c- pawn:
1 Kd2 Kd5 2 Ke3 Ke5! 3 Kf3 Kf5! 4 Kg3 Ke5
4...Ke4 5 Kg4!? Ke5! (5...Kd3? 6 b5! Kxc3 7 b6! Kd2 8 b7! c3 9 b8Q! c2 10
Qb2! Kd1 11 Kf3! +- (3.09)) 6 Kg5!? Ke4! 7 Kf6 Kd3! 8 b5 Kxc3! 9 b6 Kd2!
10 b7 c3! 11 b8Q c2! = (3.09).
5 Kg4 Ke4! =
Note that all the key squares of the c4-pawn are in the square of the protected passed pawn. C) Backward Pawn In this case the chances for a successful defence increase: A.Philidor, 1747 If White is to move, he can't win because he doesn't manage to get the opposition.
1 Kd3!? Kd7
Distant opposition. 1...Ke7 2 Ke3 Kd7! =; 1...Kc5? 2 Kc3! Kd6 3 Kd4! Ke6 4 c5! bxc5+ (4...Kd7 5 c6+! Kd6 6 Ke4 Ke6 7 c7 Kd7 8 Ke5 Kxc7 9 Ke6! +- (2.01)) 5 Kxc5! +- (A1.04).
2 Ke4 Ke6 =
Vertical opposition. 2...Ke8 (distant opposition) 3 Ke5 (3 Kf5 Kd7! = diagonal opposition) 3...Ke7! 4 Kd5 Kd7! with a draw. If Black is to move, he has to give up the opposition, and loses:
1...Kc7
1...Ke6 2 c5! +-.
2 Ke5!
This gains the diagonal opposition, which is then transformed into a winning near opposition:
2...Kd7 3 Kd5! Kc7 4 Ke6! +-
White has reached one of the key squares of the b6-pawn and would now win even without the c4-pawn (see 2.01). If one moves 4.08 one file to the left, the position would be drawn even with Black to move because b4-b5 wouldn't be a winning idea due to the remaining rook's pawn. This was discussed in the world championship match in 1894 in a slightly different form: W.Steinitz - Em.Lasker New York World Ch (6) 1894
1 Ke5 Ke7!
1...Kg7? 2 Ke6! +-.
2 Kd5 Kf6
2...Kd7 3 g5 Ke7 4 g6 = reveals a further special quality of the rook's pawn
(6.01H).
3 Ke4 Ke6
3...Kg5 also defends: 4 Kf3 Kf6! 5 Kf4 Ke6! 6 Ke4 Kf6! =.
4 Kd4 Kf6 1⁄2-1⁄2
The following example, from the practice of modern grandmasters, is more difficult: J.Timman - A.Yusupov Amsterdam 1994 Here we have the additional possibility of penetrating with the king on the queenside. But if White is aware of the rules of distant opposition, he can prevent Black from reaching the critical squares of the e3-pawn and his position can't be conquered:
1 Kg2!
1 Kg3? Kg5! 2 Kf2 Kh4! 3 Kg2 Kg4! 4 Kf2 Kh3! -+ (4.08).
1...Kg7 2 Kg1
2 Kg3 =.
2...Kf7 3 Kf1 Ke6 4 Ke2 Kd5 5 Kd2 Kd6 6 Kd1!
Since White has to prevent Black's king from penetrating on both the queenside and the kingside, this is the only move. 6 Kc2? Ke6 7 Kc3 (7 Kd2 Kf6 8 Ke2 Kg5 9 Kf2 Kh4! -+) 7...Kf6 8 Kd4 Kg5 9 Ke5 Kg4 -+.
6...Kc5 7 Kc1!
7 Kd2? Kb4! 8 Kc2 Kc4! 9 Kd2 Kb3! -+ (4.08).
7...Kb5 8 Kb1! Ka5 9 Kc1
Here the game was drawn. 9 Kc2 is also possible since the following attempt to penetrate the position is also useless: 9...Ka4 10 Kc3! Ka3 11 Kd4! Kb3 12 Ke5! Kc4! 13 Kxf5! Kd5! = (A2.02). Instead the stereotyped attempt to keep the distant opposition through 9 Ka1? loses because then the breakthrough 9...f4 10 exf4 e3! -+ is possible. 1⁄2-1⁄2 Black to move would have won easily with 1...Kh5! 2 Kg1 Kg5! 3 Kf2 Kh4! 4 Kg2 Kg4! 5 Kf2 Kh3! -+. The corresponding squares for 4.09 will be determined in A12.01. D) Others At first we look at flexible pawn-structures: J.Berger, 1890 Positions like the one in this example are usually won, thanks to White's spare tempo:
1 Kc3
1 Kc4? d5+! =; 1 Ke3 Kf7 2 Kf4 Kg6 (2...Kf6 3 d5 +- (4.08)) 3 Kg4 (3 e5? Kf7!
4 Kf5 dxe5! 5 Kxe5 Ke7! = (1.06)) 3...Kf6 4 Kh5 +-.
1...Kd7 2 Kb4
2 d5? Kc7 = (4.08).
2...Kc6 3 Ka5 Kb7
3...d5 4 e5! +- (4.06).
4 Kb5 Kc7 5 Ka6 Kc6 6 d5+
Up to now we hardly needed any exclamation marks because a win was possible on both wings. After using the spare tempo this isn't the case any more:
6...Kc7
6...Kc5 7 Kb7! Kd4 8 Kc6 Ke5 9 Kc7 +-.
7 Ka7 Kc8 8 Kb6! Kd7 9 Kb7! Kd8 10 Kc6! Ke7 11 Kc7 +-
Also in the following position there are several ways to win: J.Berger, 1890 Since White still has the spare tempo g2-g3 the position is won, no matter who is to move.
1 Kd4
1 g4? f5+! =. 1 f5+ Kd6 2 Kf4! Ke7 3 Kg4 Kf7 4 Kh5 Kg7 5 g3! Kh7 6 Kg4! and then: a) 6...Kh6 7 Kf3 Kg5 (7...Kh5 8 Kf4 Kh6 9 g4! +-) 8 g4! +- (4.09). b) 6...Kg7 7 Kf4 Kf7 8 Ke4! Ke7 9 Kd5! Kd7 10 g4! Ke7 11 Kc6! +-.
1...Kf5 2 Ke3! Kg4
2...Ke6 3 Ke4 (now we have the starting position with Black to move) 3...f5+ 4
Kd4! Kd6 5 g3! +-.
3 Ke4! Kh4!? 4 Kf3!
4 Kf5? Kg3! =.
4...f5 5 Kf2!
5 g3+? Kh3! 6 Kf2 Kh2! =.
5...Kg4 6 g3! Kh5 7 Kf3! Kg6 8 Ke3! Kf6 9 Kd4 Ke6 10 Kc5! +-
The white king has advanced to the key squares of the f5-pawn. Let's now have a look at positions with pawns on adjacent files: After N.Grigoriev If the stronger side has a passed pawn, he usually wins.
1 Ke2!
1 Kg2?! Kf5 2 Kh3 Kg5 3 Kh2! +- (3 g4? Kf4! 4 Kh4 Kf3! =).
1...Kg5 2 Ke3 Kf5 3 Kd4 +-
If Black is to play, he only manages to draw because he can immediately remove all the pawns: 1...Kf3! (1...e3? 2 f4! {2 fxe3? Kf3!! =} 2...Kf5 3 Ke1 +-) 2 Ke1 e3! 3 fxe3 Kxe3! =. With disconnected pawns the drawing chances are higher: If the king isn't able to penetrate, it doesn't even demand very precise play:
1 Kc3
1 d5+ exd5+ 2 Kd4 Kd6 3 f5 Ke7 4 Kxd5 Kf6 =.
1...Kd5 2 Kd3 Kc6
2...Kd6 3 Ke4 Kd7! 4 Ke5 Ke7! 5 f5 exf5! 6 Kxf5 Kd6 =.
3 Ke4 Kd6 4 d5 exd5+ 5 Kf5 Ke7 6 Ke5 d4 7 Kxd4 Kf6 =
In the next diagram the white king is much more active: Here Black mustn't allow the white king to penetrate via e8. He therefore has to keep the side opposition:
1 Kf7 Kd7! 2 Kf8 Kd8! 3 Kg8 Kc8! 4 Kh7 Kd7! 5 Kg7 Kc7!
5...Ke7? 6 Kg6 +- or 6 d5 +-.
6 Kg6 Kc6! =
This variation shows that the position is lost if it is moved three files to the left because the black king at a6 couldn't keep the opposition after 1 Kd6 (Chéron
1926, ECE 983).
If Black is to move, he can't prevent penetration via e8: 1...Kd7 2 Kf7! (2 Ke5? Ke7! = (4.13)) 2...Kd6 3 Ke8! Kd5 4 Ke7 Kxd4 5 Kxe6! Ke4 6 f5! +-. E) Doubled Pawns It's much more difficult to win with doubled pawns than with connected ones, but there are also a lot of winning ideas that shouldn't be underestimated. The doubled pawns take away squares from the opposing king and they can provide spare tempi. Here White can't use his spare tempo in a winning way since Black has enough corresponding squares.
1 Ke3 Ke5!
1...Ke6? 2 Kd4! Kd6 3 f4! +-.
2 f4+ Kd5! 3 Kf3 Ke6!
3...Kd4? 4 Kg2! Kd5 5 Kh3! Ke4 6 Kg3! +-.
4 Kg3 Kf7 5 Kh4 Kg6! 6 f3 Kh6! 7 Kg3 Kh5 8 Kf2 Kh4! 9 Ke3 Kg3! =
If Black is to play, he holds the draw by just keeping the opposition: 1...f4 2 Kc3 Kc5! 3 Kd3 Kd5! 4 Ke2 Kc4 5 Kf1 Kd3! 6 Kg1 Ke2 7 Kg2! Ke1! 8 Kg1! =. When Grigoriev deals with it, it immediately becomes more difficult: N.Grigoriev 64, 1936 The study is won irrespective of whose move it is. However, if White is to move, he has to be very precise:
1 Kf4!
1 f4? f6! 2 f5+ Kd6! 3 Kd4 Kc6! 4 Ke3 Kc5 5 Kf3 Kd4! 6 Kf4 Kd5! 7 f3 Kd6! 8 Kg3 Ke7! 9 Kh4 Kf7 10 Kg4 Kf8! =.
1...Kf6 2 Kg4! Kg6 3 f4!
Only now, when the black king has less space for manoeuvres, does this lead to victory.
3...f6 4 f5+! Kf7 5 Kf4 Ke7 6 Kf3 Kd6
6...Kf7 7 Ke4! +-.
7 Kg4! Ke5 8 f3! Kd4 9 Kh5! Ke5 10 Kg6! +-
With Black to move it's not that difficult: 1...Kf6 2 Kf4 Ke6 3 Kg5 Ke5 4 f4+ Ke4 5 f5 Kd5 6 f4 (6 f6 Ke5 7 f3! Ke6 8 f4! Kd5 9 Kh6! +-) 6...Kd4 7 f6 Ke4 8 Kh6 Kf5 9 Kg7! Ke6 10 f5+! and White wins. The following study by Fine is also attractive: R.Fine Basic Chess Endings, 1941 Here the doubled pawns are on an adjacent file, which brings another possibility into play, viz. the exchange of pawns. If White is to move, he is able to realize this idea:
1 Kh5! Kg8
1...h6 2 g5! hxg5 3 Kxg5! +-.
2 Kh6 Kh8 3 g5 Kg8 4 g6 Kh8 5 g7+
5 gxh7?? stalemate.
5...Kg8 6 g4! +-
If Black is to move, though, he draws with a surprising counter-attack: 1...Kf7! 2 Kh5 Ke6!! (2...Kf6? 3 Kh6! +-) 3 Kh6 Kf6! 4 g5+ Kf5! 5 Kh5 Ke4! 6 Kg4 Ke5 7 g6!? hxg6! 8 Kg5 Ke4! =. Chapter 4 Exercises solution solution solution solution solution solution solution solution solution solution solution solution solution solution Solutions to Chapter 4 Exercises After J.Berger, 1922 Black might be able to prevent the white king from advancing to the 5th rank but White just sacrifices his e-pawn in order to advance to the key squares of the c6- pawn:

3 Ke4 Kg5 4 e6 +-.
3...Kf6 4 e7! Kf7 5 Ke4!

5...Ke8 6 Kf5 Kxe7 7 Ke5! +- (2.01)
back F.Dedrle Deutsches Wochenschach, 1921 White only wins by going round from the left. If you have discovered the corresponding squares b3-d4 the exercise wasn't that difficult any more:
1 Kb2!!
1 e3? Ke4 2 Kd2 Ke5 3 Ke1 Ke4 4 Ke2 Kf5! (4...Ke5? 5 Kf3! Kf5 6 e4+! Ke5 7 Ke3! +- (4.02)) 5 Kf3 Ke5! 6 e4 Kd4! 7 Kf4 Kxc4! 8 e5 Kb3! 9 e6 c4! 10 e7 c3! 11 e8Q c2! = (3.08); 1 Kd3? Kf5 (1...Kf4 2 e4 Kg5! = (4.02)) 2 Ke3 (2 e4+ Kf4 =) 2...Ke5! 3 Kd3 Kf5 4 Kc2 Ke4! 5 Kb3 Kd4! =.

back M.Zinar, 1981 This exercise is extremely difficult because at first the white king has to take a very circuitous route. The position with wKf7 and bKd5 surprisingly is one of reciprocal zugzwang:
1 Kg7!!

5...Kxc3 6 Kc5! +-
back After Van Nyevelt Superiorité, 1792 Black can only manoeuvre within the square of the a-pawn. Nevertheless he manages to defend the key squares c4, d4 and e4-e7 (they are all within the square) if he always takes the most simple form of opposition:
1...Kd5! 2 Kf4 Kd4! 3 Kg5 Ke5!
3...Kc5? 4 Kg4! +-; since Black has no access to the c4-square.
4 Kh6 Kd6! 5 Kh7 Kd7! 6 Kg8 Ke8
6...Ke6 (the e8-square is not a key square because Black can keep the opposition
on the sixth rank) 7 Kf8 Kd6! 8 Ke8 Ke6! 9 Kd8 Kd6! 10 Kc8 Kc6! 11 Kb8 Kb6! 12 Ka8 Ka6 = (12...Ka5 13 Kb7 stalemate).

Also sacrificing the a-pawn doesn't help since Black is able to defend the key squares of White's b-pawn. The system of corresponding squares in this position will be explained in Chapter 12. 15...Kd5? 16 Kh3! Kd4 17 Kh4! Kd5 18 Kh5! Kd4 19 Kg6 Kc5 20 Kg5 Kc6 21 Kf4 Kd5 22 Kf5!

= For a detailed explanation see 12.01. ◼ If the starting position is moved one file to the right, White wins because then he can use the a-file to penetrate with his king. But if one moves it to the left it becomes easier for Black because then White can't break through on the queenside at all. It follows that in this case also 1...Kd3 draws and not only
1...Ke3.
back G.Walker, 1892 This position is an exception to the rules in 4.08 and 4.09 due to the additional very dangerous breakthrough f5-f6. White wins, whoever is to move:

back N.Grigoriev Shakhmatny listok, 1931 White has two spare tempi. Nevertheless he has to be careful since there is not much space to penetrate on the queenside:

back Maizelis (after Dedrle), 1954 If White is to move, he wins as in 4.10 by marching his king to the queenside: 1 Kg3 Kg5 2 Kf2! Kf6 (2...Kh4 3 Ke2 Kg3 4 f4! Kg2 5 e4 +-) 3 Ke2! Ke5 4 Kd3! Kd5 5 f4! +- (4.08). If Black is to move, he can just hold the position by an elegant king manoeuvre. This prevents White from making any progress on the kingside, and in case of an attack on the queenside he comes just in time with some counterplay with his f- pawn: 1...Kg5! 2 Kg2 (2 Kg3?! f4+! =) 2...Kf6! 3 Kg3 Kf7! 4 Kf2 Ke6 5 Ke2 Kd5 6 Kd3 Kc5! 7 Kc3 (7 e4 Kd6! 8 exf5 Ke5! 9 f6 Kxf6! 10 Ke4 Ke6! =)

If Black is to move, then he can easily draw due to his active king after 1...Kb4 or 1...Kc4. back A.Herberg, 1935 Though White can't go round Black (see 4.14) he can push him so far back that finally a breakthrough becomes possible:

To sharpen the eye of the reader again we have summarized the special features of the rook's pawn in this chapter. In particular, the win of the rook's pawn doesn't necessarily lead to a win, which leads to Bähr's Rule, which is explained in 5.04. Further, the reader is encouraged to study 5.08-5.10 carefully. A) Blocked Pair of Pawns and a Passed Pawn A1) Bähr's Rule A2) Bishop's Pawn and Rook's Pawn vs Rook's Pawn B) Protected Passed Pawn C) Others D) Doubled Pawns A) Blocked Pair of Pawns and a Passed Pawn We start the same way we did in Chapter 4. If the blocked rook's pawns are in the defender's half of the board, the sacrifice of the passed pawn in order to deflect the opponent's king usually leads to an easy win since the white king can immediately occupy the key square b7 after he has taken the pawn. First, however, White has to win an important tempo:
1 Kg5!
1 Ke6? Kxg6! 2 Kd6 Kf6 3 Kc6 Ke6 4 Kb6 Kd6 5 Kxa6 Kc6 =.
1...Kg8 2 Kf6 Kf8 3 Ke6
3 g7+? Kg8! =.
3...Kg7 4 Kd6 Kxg6 5 Kc6 Kf6 6 Kb6 Ke6 7 Kxa6! Kd7 8 Kb7! +-
Since the tempo-gain would fail due to stalemate, 5.01 moved one rank up the board would only be a draw. If the passed pawn is not far advanced, one has to look out for a counter-attack like in Chapter 4: If White is to play, he cannot win: 1 d4+ Kb5! 2 Kb3 Kxa5! 3 Kc4 Kb6! 4 Kd5 Kc7 5 Ke6 Kd8 6 Kd6 a5! forcing a draw. If it is Black to move, the edge of the board will be fatal for him:
1...Kb5
1...Kd5 2 d4 Kd6 3 Kc4 Kc6 4 d5+ Kd6 5 Kd4! Kd7 6 Kc5 Kc7 7 d6+ Kd7 8
Kd5! Kd8 9 Kc6! Kc8 10 Kb6! Kd7 11 Kxa6! Kxd6 12 Kb7 +-.
2 Kd4! Kb4
Black resists...
3 Kd5! Kxa5 4 Kc5!
...but is finally blocked. The white d-pawn is too fast:
4...Ka4 5 d4! Kb3 6 d5! a5 7 d6! a4 8 d7! a3 9 d8Q! a2 10 Qd4 +-
If the blocked pawns are on the middle ranks, White needs one more move to reach the key square b7 or, to put it the other way around, Black has one more tempo to reach the saving square c8. So everything depends on how far the passed pawn is already advanced. Here the pawn is just far enough back to enable White to win:
1 Kd4
After 1 f5+? Black only needs three moves after taking the f-pawn to get to the c8-square: 1...Kf6 2 Kf4 Kf7 3 Ke5 Ke7! 4 Kd5 Kf6! 5 Kc5 Kxf5! 6 Kb5 Ke6! 7 Kxa5 Kd7! 8 Kb6 Kc8! =.
1...Kf5 2 Kc5 Kxf4 3 Kb5 Ke5 4 Kxa5! Kd6 5 Kb6! Kd7 6 Kb7! +-
The different pawn formations that are based on this principle made the theorist Bähr in 1936 define a rule that is named after him. It predicts the outcome of these positions, and we will now take a closer look at it: A1) Bähr's Rule Of course one could also evaluate the outcome by pure counting. Whoever prefers this can go straight on to the diagram. For our formulation of the rule one always has to evaluate the point of intersection between the diagonal of the pawn to the 8th (1st) rank and the c-file (if there is no point of intersection then it will be the c8-square; in example 5.03 therefore it is the c7-square). Bähr's Rule (from the defender's viewpoint) states: the position is a draw if the distance between the defender's king and the passed pawn is smaller than the distance between the defender's pawn and the evaluated point of intersection. Otherwise the position is lost if no successful counter-attack (like in 5.02) is possible. Distance of course means the amount of moves that a king needs to make the journey. For reasons of clarity we again summarize the requirements: 1) The rule is applicable with blocked a-pawns and passed pawns from d- to h- file. 2) The kings must have conquered the maximum space (look at the win of tempo in 5.01). 3) The attacking king mustn't be able to occupy the key squares of his passed pawn. After so much theory now back to the practice: The black king is two squares away from the f-pawn; on the other hand the point of intersection is three squares away from a4. Therefore the position is a draw:
1 Kd4 Kf5! 2 Kc4 Kxf4! 3 Kb4 Ke5 4 Kxa4 Kd6 5 Kb5 Kc7 =
The following position also illustrates the rule: Here the point of intersection is c6, and the distances are therefore equal (3 and 3). White wins as follows:
1 Kf3! Kf5
1...Kh4 2 Kf4! and White queens the g-pawn.
2 Ke3 Kg4 3 Kd3 Kg3 4 Kc3 Kxg2 5 Kb3 Kf3 6 Kxa3! Ke4 7 Kb4 Kd5 8
Kb5! Kd6 9 Kb6! Kd7 10 Kb7! and White wins. But there are a few exceptions to the rule, when the passed pawn is not too far advanced. Here one has to calculate precisely whether the counterattack is successful: If White is to move, he wins (also with the king on e2), though the evaluation (3- 2) predicts a draw: 1 d3!
1 Kb3? Kd3! (1...Kc5? 2 Kc3! Kb5 3 Kd4! Kxa5 4 Kc5! Ka4 5 d4! Kb3 6 d5! +-
(5.02)) 2 Kb4 Kd4! 3 d3 Kxd3! 4 Kc5 Ke4! = (2.10).
1...Kd5 2 Kd2!
2 Kc3? Kc5! 3 d4+ Kb5! is a draw (5.02).
2...Kd4 3 Ke2! Kc5 4 Ke3! Kd5
4...Kb5 5 Kd4! Kb4 6 Kd5! Kxa5 7 Kc5! +- (5.02).
5 d4! Kc6 6 Ke4! Kd6 7 d5 Kd7 8 Ke5 Ke7 9 d6+ Kd8 10 Kd5 Kd7 11 Kc5 Kd8 12 Kb6 +- If Black is to move, he draws with 1...Kc4!, so the position must be an exception in any case since the rule doesn't depend on the right to move. Further exceptions are: 1) wKd2,Pa5,e2; bKd4,Pa6 is with White to move a draw and not won, as the evaluation (2-2) would predict; 2) wKe3,Pa6,d2; bKe5,Pa7 is winning for White, if Black is to play, but drawn with White to move; 3) 5.02 with White to move is a draw and not won. Of course there are also exceptions when the kings are still further away from the pawns; e.g.: P.Motwani - J.Shaw Scottish Ch 1993
1...Ke4!! =
We have a reciprocal zugzwang with White to move. 5.06A with a pawn at c3 instead of c4 would therefore be won for White after 1...Ke4 2 c4! +-. In endgame literature Bähr's Rule is often formulated in the following way (from the viewpoint of the attacker): Requirement: the attacking king is next to his passed pawn, and the defending king is in front of the pawn. 1) When the blocked rook's pawn has passed the middle of the board, the attacker will win. 2) If it is still in his half of the board, one has to draw the diagonal of the defender's pawn to the c-file and, from the point of intersection of the c-file, the 'border diagonal' to the first rank of the attacker. If the passed pawn is below or on the 'border diagonal' the position is won; otherwise it is a draw. The diagonals go from a3 to c5 and from c5 to f2. The passed pawn on h2 is above the border diagonal, therefore the position is drawn. One can also apply the rule if the attacking king has conquered more space but is not placed on a key square. Thus with the kings at g3 and g5 one has to look at the diagonals a4- c6-g2 and with kings at g4 and g6 at the diagonals a5-c7-h2. Of course also for this formulation there exist the corresponding exceptions (see, for example the list following Av 219). We now want to have a look what consequences our considerations have for the fight for the critical squares: W.Bähr, 1935
1 Ke3!?
Though this forces the capture of one of the two pawns, it is Black who decides which one and therefore he can draw.
1...Kf7!
Black has to keep the h5-pawn; otherwise he would lose, due to Bähr's Rule. Thus he only fights for the squares e5, f5 and g5.
2 Kd4 Kf6! 3 Kd5!? Kf5! 4 Kc6 Ke6
4...Kg4? 5 Kb6 +-.
5 Kb6 Kd6 6 Kxa6 Kc6 7 Ka7 Kc7! 8 a6 Kc8! 9 Kb6 Kb8! 10 Kc6 Ka7! 11
Kd6 Kxa6! 12 Ke6 Kb6 13 Kf6 Kc6 14 Kg6 Kd6 15 Kxh5 Ke7! 16 Kg6 Kf8! = ◼ There are a great many studies concerning this issue (see for example ECE 243-68). For instance: wKe1,Pb4,h4; bKe8,Pb5,h5 (Capablanca, 1921, ECE 254); whoever is to move wins, e.g. 1 Ke2! Kf8 2 Kd3! Ke7 3 Ke3! +-. Furthermore, one must be aware that although it is generally best for the attacker to have the pawn far-advanced, there is a danger of the king being blocked in at the edge of the board. In 1936 Bähr demonstrated this in an extraordinary way: wKd1,Pa2,h3; bKd5,Pa3,h4 (ECE 264). White has to defend the key squares of the h3-pawn and block the black king in the corner after ...Kxa2, thus 1 Ke1!! =. A2) Bishop's Pawn and Rook's Pawn vs Rook's Pawn Like in Chapter 4, we also face some problems here because of the proximity of the blocked pawns: H.Fahrni - S.Alapin, 1917 If Black were to move, he would be in zugzwang and would have to allow the white king to b6. However, it is White to move and it seems as if he is in zugzwang. This is not true though, because behind him he has more space available than Black, who always has to answer Kd5 with ...Kc8 and he can only move to c7 after Kc5. Therefore c4 or d4 and b8(d8) are further corresponding squares (in Chapter 12 we will deal with the theory of corresponding squares in more detail). Since c4 and d4 are next to each other but b8 and d8 are not, a so- called triangulation leads to victory:
1 Kd5! Kc8 2 Kd4 Kd8 3 Kc4 Kc8 4 Kd5! Kc7
4...Kd8 5 Kd6! Kc8 6 c7! Kb7 7 Kd7! Ka7 8 Kc6 +- (8 c8Q?? stalemate; 8 c8R,
B or N+ +-; the subject of underpromotion will be covered in Chapter 6).
5 Kc5!
This produces the starting position with Black to move.
5...Kc8 6 Kb6! 1-0
Due to 6...Kb8 7 Kxa6! Kc7 8 Kb5! +-. An exercise for the indefatigable: try to figure out whether the c-pawn fits into our formulation of Bähr's Rule. If the rook's pawn of the defender is still on its starting square then the winning method we have just seen isn't practicable. But if the attacker's rook's pawn has also not been moved, then he still wins without difficulty. As, for example, Aron Nimzowitsch (in section 4.7 of My System) explains brilliantly in his own way, the f-pawn can just be advanced and then be queened: U.Garbisu - J.M.Gomez Esteban Pamplona 1993/4
1 Kf2 f3! 2 Kf1
2 Ke1 Ke3! 3 Kf1 f2 4 h3 h6 5 h4 h5 6 Kg2 Ke2! -+.
2...Ke3! 0-1
The black h-pawn still has the double step so that he can always react accordingly: 3 Ke1 f2+ 4 Kf1 Kf3! 5 h3 (5 h4 h6 6 h5 Ke3 -+) 5...h5 6 h4 Ke3 - +. Play is a lot more complicated if the rook's pawn has already moved: R.Vaganian - J.Sunye Neto Rio de Janeiro Interzonal 1979 White can draw in a study-like way because he manages to prevent Black from getting the opposition at f4. In the game, he erred by 1 Kg3? h5! 2 Kf3 h4! 3 Kg2 Kg4! 4 Kf2 Kf4! 5 Ke2 Ke4! 6 Kf2 Kd3! 7 Kf3 h3!! (D). Here White resigned. The reader should try to memorize this position, for only it can explain the nuances of the main variation (see 12.05-12.08 for a detailed discussion of the corresponding squares). a) 8 Kf2 Kd2! 9 Kf3 (9 Kf1 Ke3! 10 Ke1 f4 11 Kf1 Kf3! -+) 9...Ke1! 10 Ke3 (10 Kg3 Ke2 11 Kxh3 f4 -+) 10...Kf1! 11 Kf3 Kg1! 12 Kg3 f4+! 13 Kf3 Kh1 - +. b) 8 Kf4 Ke2! 9 Kxf5 Kf3! -+ (A2.03). This winning manoeuvre was first shown by Maizelis. Returning to the starting position, White could have secured a draw as follows:
1 Ke2!! Kg4 2 Ke3!
2 Kf2? Kf4 3 Ke2 Ke4 4 Kf2 h5! 5 Ke2 h4! 6 Kf2 Kd3! 7 Kf3 h3! -+.
2...h5
2...Kh3 3 Kf4! =.
2...f4+ 3 Kf2 h5 4 Ke2 Kf5 5 Kf3 Ke5 6 Kf2 Ke4 7 Ke2! f3+ 8 Kf2 Kf4 (D).
When the h-pawn is at h6, h5 or h4 White draws by moving his king to a square with the same colour as the h-pawn (if it is still at h7 he will lose in any case and versus the pawn at h3 he always draws). 9 Kf1! Ke3 10 Ke1! f2+ 11 Kf1! Kf3 12 h3! =.
3 Kf2! Kf4 4 Ke2! Ke4 5 Kf2! h4
5...Kd3 6 Kf3! h4 7 h3 Kd2 8 Kf4 Ke2 9 Kxf5 Kf3 10 Ke5! = (2.10).
6 Ke2! f4 7 Kf2! f3
The h-pawn is on a dark square, so:
8 Ke1
Or 8 Kg1, but not 8 Kf1? Ke3! -+.
8...Ke3 9 Kf1! f2 10 h3! =
B) Protected Passed Pawn Here one has to watch out for a stalemate: N.Grigoriev, 1930 If White is to move, he can't directly make any progress, thus he once again has to give Black the move. How can one lose that tempo? Of course, a triangulation offers itself:
1 Kd6
1 Ke5 Kf7 2 Kf5 Kg7 3 g6? Kh6! =. This doesn't lead to a win because of the
edge of the board (stalemate).
1...Kf7
1...Kg7 2 Ke7 Kg6 3 Kf8 +-.
2 Ke5 Kg7
2...Kg6 3 Ke6 (now we have the starting position with Black to move) 3...Kg7 4
Kf5 +-.
3 Kf5 Kf7
3...Kh7 4 Kf6 Kg8 5 Kg6 +-.
4 g6+ Kg7 5 Kg5! +- If one moves 5.11 one rank up the board, this winning manoeuvre doesn't work any longer and the position is drawn (see 6.01H in Chapter 6 about fortresses). C) Others We now consider cases where there are no passed pawns. If Black is to move, he draws with 1...Ke6!, while White can get to the key squares of the h6-pawn by means of an encirclement:
1 Kd5! Ke7 2 Ke5! Kf7 3 Kf5!
3 Kd6?! still wins, but represents a loss of time: 3...Kf6 4 Kd5! Kf7 5 Ke5! Ke7
6 h5 +-.
3...Kg7 4 Ke6! Kg6
4...h5 5 g5! +- (5.11).
5 h5+ Kg5 6 Kf7! Kxg4 7 Kg6! +- With rooks' pawns, even an active king is no guarantee of a win: Here everything depends on who is to move. If it is White to play, then he cannot win: 1 h4
1 Kg5 Kg7 2 h4 Kf7 (2...h6+? 3 Kf5! Kf7 4 h5! +-) 3 h5 Kg7 4 h6+ =; the black
king can't be forced out of the corner (see Chapter 6). 1 Kh5!? Kg8 (1...Kg7 2 Kg5 Kg8! 3 Kf6 Kf8! 4 h4 Kg8! 5 Ke6 Kg7 6 h5 Kg8 7 Kf6 Kf8! 8 g5 Kg8 9 g6 hxg6 =) 2 Kg5 Kg7! =.
1...Kg8 2 h5 Kh8! 3 g5 Kg8 4 g6 hxg6
4...Kh8 5 Kg5 hxg6 also leads to a draw.
5 hxg6 Kh8! = If Black is to move, he loses: 1...Kg8 2 h4 Kh8 3 g5 Kg8 4 h5! Kh8 5 g6 hxg6 (5...Kg8 6 g7! Kf7 7 Kxh7! +-) 6 hxg6! Kg8 7 g7! +-. With the white h-pawn still at h2, 5.13 would be won, whoever is to move, due to the possible double step. But if the kings were on g5 and g7, even the double step would not help; for example, 1 Kh5 h6! =, 1 Kf5 Kf7 =, 1 h3 Kg8! = or 1 h4 Kf7 =. If the pawns are still further back it becomes a lot more complicated: F.Dedrle La Stratégie, 1936 This study is exactly on the borderline between a win and a draw. With White to move, the activity of the black king is not sufficient to avoid a loss:
1 Kd6!
1 Kd4? Kf4! 2 Kd3 h5 3 Ke2 h4 4 Kf2 Ke4! =; 1 h3? Kf4! 2 Ke6 Kg3! 3 Kf6
Kxg2! 4 h4 Kf3! (4...Kg3? 5 h5! Kf4 6 h6! +-) 5 h5 Ke4! 6 h6 Kd5! 7 Kg7 Ke6! =.
1...h6
1...Kf6 2 Kd7 Kf7 3 h3! Kf8 4 Ke6! Ke8 5 Kf6 Kf8 6 Kg5 Kg7 7 h4 +- (see
5.13).
1...h5 and now:
a) 2 Ke7? h4! 3 h3 Ke5! (a funny situation because the white king is hindered by the opposition to get back to his own pawns) 4 Kf7 Kf5! 5 Kg7 Kg5! 6 Kh7 Kh5! 7 Kh8!? Kh6! =. It was important that the black king had access to all necessary squares. b) 2 Kd5 h4 3 h3! Kf4 4 Ke6! +-. 2 h3
2 Ke7 h5 3 Kf7 h4 4 h3! Kg5 5 Kg7 Kf4 6 Kf6 Kg3 7 Kg5 +-.
After 2 Kd5? we nearly have the starting position again. Only the h7-pawn is now at h6, but this doesn't change anything with 2...h5! (2...Kf4? doesn't work:
3 Ke6 Ke3 4 Kf5 Kf2 5 h4 Kxg2 6 h5 +-), due to 3 Kd4 Kf4! 4 Kd3 h4 5 Kd4
h3! 6 g3+ Kf3! 7 Kd3 Kg2! =.
2...Kf6!?
2...Kf4 3 Ke6! Kg3 4 Kf5! Kxg2 5 h4! Kg3 6 h5! +-.
3 Kd7!
3 g3? Kf5! 4 Kd5!? Kf6! 5 Ke4 Ke6! 6 g4 Kf6! 7 Kf4 Kg6 8 h4 Kf6! is a draw (5.12).

5...Kf5 6 Kf7 Ke4 7 Kg6 Kf3 8 g4 Kg3 9 Kxh6! +-
◼ The extra pawn also counts when the h-pawn is already far advanced, as long as the attacking king is sufficiently active, e.g. Milošević-Diz Suares, Hamburg 1995: wKg4,Ph5; bKe5,Pg7,h7: 1 Kg5 h6+! 2 Kg6 Kf4! 0-1. 1 h6!? would also have lost: 1...g6! 2 Kg5 Ke6! 3 Kf4 Kd5 4 Kg4 Ke4! 5 Kg5 Ke5! 6 Kg4 Kf6! 7 Kf4 g5+! -+. If the candidate is a rook's pawn, there might also be some problems, as the following example by von der Lasa shows. At his time it was heavily discussed in the literature. In 1925, Nikolai Grigoriev showed that if Black is to move, he manages to draw. von der Lasa, 1843; Grigoriev, 1925 If White is to move, he wins quite easily:
1 Kg3 Kg5 2 Kf3 Kf5
2...Kh4 3 Kf4 Kh5 4 Kf5 Kh6 5 g4 Kh7 6 Kg5 Kh8 7 Kg6 Kg8 8 h4 Kh8 9 Kf7
Kh7 10 g5 Kh8 11 h5 g6 12 Kxg6 +-.
3 h4 g6 4 Kg3 g5 5 h5 g4 6 h6 Kg6 7 Kxg4 +-
If Black is to move, he can place his king in such an active way that the win becomes impossible:
1...Kf4! 2 Ke2 Ke4!

D) Doubled Pawns With doubled rook's pawns, the prospects for a draw are very high. That is because the winning method of exchanging the front pawn and winning with the back pawn here doesn't exist. N.Grigoriev 64, 1932 Here one can only win because the defending king doesn't get to his pawn.

back J.Crum, 1913 This position is another exception to Bähr's Rule. White wins although the black king is only two moves away from the e2-pawn and the distance between a7 and c4 is 3. White manages to prevent his a-pawn from being captured by threatening to queen his e-pawn:
1 Ke1!
1 Kd2? Kd4! with a draw according to Bähr's Rule (3-2). The draw is again
based on a counter-attack: 2 e3+ Kc4 3 Ke2 Kb5! =.

back Based on E.Colle - E.Grünfeld Karlsbad 1929 In the game the black king was at f1 and Grünfeld resigned. But with the king at e2 the position is a draw:
1...Kd3! 2 Kg5 Ke4! 3 Kxh5 Kf5! 4 Kh6 Kf6! 5 h5 Kf7! 6 Kg5 Kg7! =
The distance between the black king and the pawn is 2, while the distance between c8 and a5 is 3. Therefore the position is a draw according to Bähr's Rule. back F.Prokop Šach, 1943 White is able to exploit the bad position of the black king:
1 Kb4!!

4...Kb3 5 Ke5! Kc4 6 Kf6! Kd5!?
It seems as if now White can't win since he is to move, but by means of a triangulation he can use his surplus of corresponding squares to give Black the move. Note that here the order of moves is strict (in contrast to 5.08) because the white king has to keep a distance of 2 moves from the h7-pawn due to Black's counterplay.

A dozen exclamation marks in 10 moves underline the particular beauty and difficulty of this study. back W.Bähr, 1936 At first White has to get the distant opposition, and then transform it, with the help of the familiar procedures, into a near opposition in order to penetrate with the king:
1 Kd1! Kc7 2 Ke2!
2 Kc2? Kc8 = (distant opposition).

For a detailed discussion of the corresponding squares see A12.02. back After Réti and Mandler (1929) and Grigoriev (1930) In this exercise again the method of exclusion proves to be good, after one has worked through A5.08 and doesn't want to go into a discussion of corresponding squares (see A12.03).

draws (5.16). back 6: Fortresses, Stalemates and Underpromotion A) Simple Fortresses B) Direct Applications C) Stalemates D) Blockade E) Underpromotion A) Simple Fortresses At the edge of the board and especially in the corner there are often positions in which neither a material superiority (extra pawn), nor a positional advantage (active king) can be transformed into a win. If the defence doesn't demand a great deal of precision we characterize such positions as fortresses. The knowledge of such fortresses in complicated endgames can help to find the right defence or it can be the guide for accurate play in a winning position. Therefore the reader should commit the following eight fortresses to memory:
1 Ke8 Kh8 2 Kf7 stalemate
Nothing changes if the blocked pawns build the base or the top of a pawn-chain, e.g. bPg6,f5 and wPg5,f4.
1 Kf5 Kg8! 2 Kf6 stalemate. The sacrifice of the g-pawn would only lead to
Fortress A. Here again there are no more tricks for White:
1 g4 Kh8 2 g5 Kg8 3 Kf6 Kh8 4 g6 Kg8 =
4...hxg6 is also sufficient to draw.
1 Ke8 Kh8 2 Kf7 stalemate
As in 6.01A, the blocked pawns here could also be part of a pawn-chain. As in 6.01B the white king can't attack the g-pawn from the right:
1 Kd5
1 f8Q+ Kxf8! 2 Kd6 Ke8 3 Ke6 Kf8! = (6.01D).
1...Kf8! 2 Ke6 stalemate
Black shouldn't be afraid of the advance of the h-pawn:
1 h3 Kh8 2 h4 Kg8 3 h5 Kh8 4 h6 Kg8!
4...gxh6?? 5 Kf7 +-.
5 Ke6 gxh6! =
If Black stays in the corner, he has nothing to be afraid of:
1 g4 Kh8!
1...Kf8? 2 Kh7! Kf7 3 g5! Kf8 4 g6 +-.
2 Kf7 Kh7! 3 g5 Kh8! 4 g6 stalemate
1 Ke7 Kg8 2 Kf6 Kh8 3 g7+ Kg8
3...Kh7 =.
4 Kg6 stalemate
As we know from Chapters 4 and 5, Black loses if one moves 6.01H down or to the left. B) Direct Applications We now want to examine two positions in which the fortresses above determine the further play: Here it doesn't matter who is to move:
1 Kd5 Kf7 2 Kd6 Ke8 3 Ke6
3 Ke5 Kf7 4 Kf5 g6+! =.
3...Kf8! 4 Kd7
4 Kf5 Kf7! =.
4...Kf7!
4...Kg8? (until White has played g6, it's not sufficient just to stay in the corner) 5
Ke7 Kh8 6 Kf7 Kh7 7 h6 g6 8 Kf6 +-. 5 g6+ Kg8 = (6.01F). Not, of course, 5...Kf6?? 6 Ke8! +-. G.Lolli, 1763 In this old position the win is not difficult if White doesn't allow a fortress. 1 g6 Only this pawn move wins: 1 f6+? gxf6+ (1...Kf7 2 fxg7 Kxg7! 3 Ke6 h6 4 g6 = (6.01H)) 2 gxf6+ Kf7 3 Kf5 Ke8 = (12.06); 1 h6? gxh6! 2 gxh6 Kf7! = (12.05).
1...hxg6
1...h6 2 Kd5 (2 f6+? gxf6+ = (6.01H)) 2...Kf8 (2...Kd7 3 f6 Ke8 4 fxg7! +-;
2...Kf6 3 Kd6 Kxf5 4 Ke7 Kg5 5 Kf7 +-) and now:
a) 3 Ke6 Ke8 4 Kd6 (4 f6? Kf8! = (6.01E or 6.01H)) 4...Kf8 (4...Kd8 5 f6 +-) 5 Kd7! +-. b) 3 Kd6 Ke8 4 Ke6 Kf8 5 Kd7! Kg8 6 Ke7 Kh8 7 f6 +-. 2 hxg6! Kf8 3 Kd6 3 f6? Kg8! = (6.01E).
3...Ke8 4 Ke6 Kf8 5 Kd7! Kg8 6 Ke7 Kh8 7 f6 gxf6 8 Kf7 +-
The reader can verify that White also wins with Black to move. C) Stalemates With the fortresses it was sufficient to remain passive because the stalemate situations came automatically with the opponent's attempts to win. We now want to look at a few examples in which the defender must actively build his own stalemate cage. Chigorin - S.Tarrasch Ostend 1905 The black king has already advanced to the critical squares of the f5-pawn, which usually would be enough for a win. However, the proximity to the edge of the board allows a possible stalemate:
1 Kg4!?
However, Chigorin missed it, losing after 1 gxf6? gxf6! 2 Kg4 Ke5 3 Kh3 (3 Kh5 Kxf5! 4 Kh6 Kg4!? 5 Kxh7 Kh5! -+) 3...Kf4 -+ 0-1. 1 g6? h5! -+; 1 h5? h6! -+.
1...Ke4 2 g6! h6
2...hxg6 3 fxg6! f5+ 4 Kg3 =.
3 Kh5!! Kxf5 stalemate.
A counterattack again forces a draw in the next position: J.Piket - V.Korchnoi Nijmegen (8) 1993
1 Ke5!? a3?
After this mistake, which gives a valuable tempo away, Piket finds an elegant solution to neutralize the dangerous c-pawn. 1...Kc4! would not have lost precious time: 2 g4 c5! 3 gxf5 (3 g5 Kd3 4 Kf6 c4! 5 Kg7 c3! 6 Kxh7 c2! 7 Kxg6 c1Q! 8 h7 Qh1 -+) 3...gxf5! 4 Kf6 Kd5! 5 Kg7 Ke6! 6 Kxh7 Kf7! 7 f4 c4!
8 a3 c3! 9 Kh8 c2 10 h7 Kg6 11 Kg8 c1Q -+.
2 g4 f4
2...fxg4 3 fxg4! Kb4 4 Kf6! c5! 5 Kg7! c4! 6 Kxh7! c3! 7 Kxg6! c2! 8 h7! c1Q!
9 h8Q! Qc2+ 10 Kg5 Qxa2 11 Qf8+ =.
3 Kf6 Kd6 1⁄2-1⁄2
Because of 4 Kg7 Ke7 5 Kxh7 Kf7! 6 Kh8 c5 7 h7 c4 8 g5 c3 stalemate. Stalemates can also occur in the middle of the board: Idea from N.Grigoriev, 1934 How should White prepare against the threat of ...f5? If he plays f5 himself the black king is already on its critical squares. 1 f5! Surprisingly, this works nevertheless. Not 1 Ke4? Kb4 2 Kd3 (2 f5 Kc4 3 Kf4 Kd5 4 Ke3 Ke5! -+) 2...f5 3 Kd4 Ka4 4 Ke3 (4 Kc4?! h4 -+) 4...Ka3 5 Ke2 Kb4 6 Kd2 Kc4 7 Ke2 Kd4 8 Kd2 Ke4 9 Ke2 h4 -+.
1...Kd5
1...Kc4 2 Ke4! Kc3 3 Ke3! Kb3 4 Kd3! Ka2 5 Ke2! =.
2 Kf4!
The stalemate cage now saves the game, while all other attempts to win fail, if White takes the side or the diagonal opposition in time. In doing so, he mustn't quit the square of the g4-pawn because of the threat ...h5-h4.
2...Kd6
2...Kd4?! stalemate.
3 Ke4! Kc6 4 Kd4! Kb6 5 Ke4! Kb5 6 Kd3! Ka5 7 Ke3! = (virtual opposition).
A more detailed discussion of the corresponding squares can be found in A12.04. There it will also become clearer why the following moves lose: 7 Ke2? Kb4 -+;
7 Kc3? h4 -+; 7 Ke4? Ka4! (7...Ka6? 8 Kd4! =) 8 Ke3 Ka3! 9 Ke2 Kb4 10 Kd2
Kc4 11 Ke3 Kc3! 12 Kf4 Kd2 13 Ke4 Ke2 -+. N.Grigoriev (after Mattison), 1934 Since the study from which we took the idea in 6.06 is so beautiful and deep, we don't want to hide it from our readers. Even though in the beginning the black outside passed h-pawn is still on the board, this soon proves to be of no importance. The main focus is to get the opposition in order to break the possible stalemate defence. 1 b4! Kd4 2 Ke6!!
2 Kg5? c5! 3 b5 Kd5! 4 Kh6 c4! (4...Kc4? 5 c3! Kd5 6 Kxh7! c4 7 Kg7 +-) 5 c3

5 Kf5 Kd5 6 Kg5! c6 7 Kh4!!
7 Kxh5? c5! 8 b5 c4! = (6.06).
7...c5 8 b5! c4 9 Kxh5!
White wins the opposition, and thus the position.
9...Kd6 10 Kh6! Kd7 11 Kg5 Ke6 12 Kg6! Ke5 13 Kf7 Kd6 14 Ke8 Kc5 15
Kd7 Kd5 16 a5 +- For the practical man the following position may seem to be unimportant but the only pawn ending study by Genrikh Kasparian should not be missing here: G.Kasparian Shakhmaty v SSSR, 1937 The strange pawn-structure enables White to set up an original stalemate cage:
1 Kd7!
Threatening to get into the square of the h-pawn. Not 1 Kd8? Kb8! -+.
1...h5! 2 Kc7! h4!
2...Ka7? 3 b6+ Ka6 4 b5+ Ka5 5 Kxb7 h4 6 Ka7 +-.
3 Kb6! h3
3...Kb8 4 Ka5! b6+ 5 Ka4! h3 6 a3 h2 7 b3! h1Q stalemate.
4 Ka5! h2
4...b6+ 5 Ka4! h2 6 a3 h1Q 7 b3! Qb7 stalemate.
5 b6! h1Q 6 b5! Even though White still has to make two pawn moves, Black can't prevent White from stalemating himself. Without a doubt this study is a masterpiece.
6...Qa1 7 a4! Qe1+ 8 b4 =
◼ ECE contains many further studies that end with the creation of a stalemate cage (for example, 417, 1345, 1358, 1453). Selezniev created one that needed a lot less material than the study by Kasparian: Selezniev, 1930 1 a5! b5 2 a6! Kd5 3 Kb4! Kc6 4 Ka5! Kc5 stalemate. D) Blockade Now we deal with a very different kind of fortress: Due to the total blockade, the white king can't lend any support to his passed pawns: 1 e6+ Kf6 2 Kf3 Ke7 = Also in the following position at first sight there seems no penetration possible. P.Morphy - A.Anderssen Paris 1858 However, the stalemate trick that completes the blockade can be easily cracked by a triangulation:
1 Kg4
1 Kf6?? stalemate.
1...Kf7 2 Kh5 Kg8 3 Kg5! Kf7 4 g8Q+ Kxg8 5 Kf6! +-
E) Underpromotion At the end of this chapter let's have a look at three studies in which only underpromotion of the pawn leads to a win because queening would lead to a stalemate. Of course such cases are very rare in practice, but you never know. In the first example, only the rook wins: G.Nadareishvili, 1963
1 Ke2! c3 2 g8R!
2 g8Q? d1Q+! (2...d1R? 3 Qb3! Rd2+ 4 Ke1 Rd3 5 Qa4+ Kb2 6 Qb5+! Kc2 7 Qf5! +-) 3 Kxd1! c2+! 4 Kd2 c1Q+! 5 Kxc1 stalemate.
2...Kb2 3 Rg1!
3 Rc8? Kc2! 4 Rd8 Kc1 =.
3...Kc2 4 Rf1 Kb3 5 Kd3 Kb2 6 Rg1 Kb3
6...d1Q+ 7 Rxd1! c2 8 Rd2! +-.
7 Rb1+! Ka2 8 Kc2! +-
◼ By the way, the simplest example of a forced underpromotion is wKa5,Pc7; bKa7: 1 c8R! +-. In the following only a bishop does it: P.Joitsa, 1955 1 a6! h3 2 a7! h2 3 a8B! +- Not 3 a8Q? h1Q! 4 Qb8+ Kh3 5 Qh8+ Kg3! 6 Qxh1 stalemate. ◼ If one puts the white a-pawn on h5, then only a promotion to a rook wins. And finally only the knight: J.Kling and B.Horwitz, 1851
1...b2+ 2 Kb1 a5 3 b7 a4 4 b8N! Kb3 5 Na6 a3
5...Ka3 6 Nc5 Kb4 7 Nxd3+! Kb3 8 Nxb2! a3 9 Nd1! a2+ 10 Ka1! Kc2 11 d4!
+-.
6 Nc5+! Kb4 7 Ne4! Kb3 8 Nc3! +-
◼ Of course there are a lot more studies that deal with underpromotion (e.g.
ECE 288, 1195, 1309, 1375, 1395, 1413, 1416, 1434, 1439, 1440, 1485, 1550,
1552, 1555, 1576), while underpromotions hardly ever occur in practical games. In studies even a multiple underpromotion has been achieved. For example, in
1983 Zinar published the following study: wKh2,Pb7,c7,d7,f3,g2,g5,h3;
bKh5,Ph4,g6,c2. 1...c1Q 2 c8R! Qb2 3 b8B! Qd4 4 d8R! +- (4 d8N? Qd7! =). (Further examples: ECE 1536, 1592, 1602.) But underpromotion does not automatically avoid the draw. An unknown Czech composer refined an exercise, published by Joseph in 1922 in the British Chess Magazine, in the following way: After Joseph, British Chess Magazine, 1922 1 b6+! 1 bxa6?? b5! -+.
1...Kb8!?
1...Kxb6 2 h4! +-.
2 h4! a5 3 h5! a4 4 h6! a3 5 h7! a2 6 h8Q! 6 h8B? a1Q 7 Bxa1! avoids the immediate stalemate, but leads to a familiar fortress.
6...a1Q (D)
Now White is able to manoeuvre with his queen in such a cunning way that Black's stalemate defence becomes impossible:
7 Qg8!
The only winning square. 7 Qf8? Qa3! and 7 Qe8? Qg7! throw the win away.
7...Qa2 8 Qe8! Qa4 (D)
9 Qe5+! Ka8 10 Qh8! +-
It is mate in two more moves. Chapter 6 Exercises Be careful: A6.10-13 contain some techniques from later chapters. If they are too difficult, you can try them again after you have studied Chapter 11. solution solution solution solution solution solution solution solution solution solution solution solution solution solution Solutions to Chapter 6 Exercises After Hašek, 1928 You have certainly noticed that even two additional h-pawns wouldn't be of any help for White. If Black moves between g8 and h8 the position is a 'dead' draw:
1 h4 Kh8 2 h5 Kg8 3 g4 Kh8 4 g5 Kg8 5 g6 Kh8! =
By the way, the final position is a very difficult one for the evaluation function of Fritz 4. back Instructive example Small difference, great consequences. White wins easily by sacrificing his front g-pawn:
1 g4 Kh8 2 g5 Kg8 3 g6 Kh8 4 g4 hxg6 5 Kf6 Kh7 6 g5 +-
back T.Luther - P.Wells Graz 1991 Thomas Luther knew the fortress 6.01H, so he reacted calmly to Black's winning attempt:
1...f5!?
1...Kf7 2 Ke4 Ke6 3 Kd4 f5 4 gxf5+! Kxf5 5 Ke3! = (4.08).
2 gxf5! g4 3 Ke3 1⁄2-1⁄2 Because of 3...g3 4 Kf3 with a draw (6.01H). ◼ F.Sämisch-R.Spielmann, Teplice-Šanov 1922 (ECE 1187), wKd1,Pa2,b3; bKa5,Pa3,b4,c5, features a similar idea: 1...c4!? 2 Kc2! c3 3 Kc1 1⁄2-1⁄2. The white king can't be forced away from the squares c1, c2 and d1. back Instructive example Compared to 6.02, here White still has spare tempi with his h-pawn, which enable a penetration via g6 that secures the win:
1 Kf5!

As you can see from these variations, A6.04 would be a draw, whoever is to move, if the h-pawn were already at h3 or h4. back Dantas - J.Souza Mendes Mar del Plata 1951 You certainly haven't been bluffed by Kh3 and have just sacrificed the g-pawn:
1 Kh3!? g2
1...Kxf3?? stalemate.
2 Kxg2 Ke3 -+
back F.Hellers - V.Eingorn Debrecen European Team Ch 1992 Black can only hold the draw by building a stalemate refuge for his king:

3...h5! 4 Ke5 Kh4! 5 Kxf4 stalemate (1⁄2-1⁄2)
back B.Züger - Ru.Rodriguez Dubai Olympiad 1986 Actually we deal with such positions in Chapter 8 on passed pawns. Due to the forced variations the stalemate idea nearly creates itself: 1 c7! Kxc7 2 Ke5 f4! 3 gxf4! g4!? 4 Ke4 4 f5? g3! 5 f6 Kd7 -+.

back Y.Averbakh This position, which is very close to 6.07, occurred in a practical game. Because of his detailed analysis we have ascribed it to Averbakh. The drawing manoeuvre is not at all obvious:
1...Kd7!!
1...Kc5? 2 Kg4 Kd6 (2...c6 3 b6! +-) 3 a6 bxa6 4 bxa6! Kc6 5 c5! and White
wins.
1...c6? (here this stalemate defence is not sufficient since the black king has to
stay in the square of the b6-pawn and therefore isn't able to keep the opposition) 2 b6! c5 3 Kg4 Kd7 4 Kh5 Kc6 5 Kxh6 Kd6 6 Kg6 Kc6 7 Kg7 Kd6 8 Kf8 Kd7 9 Kf7 Kc6 10 Ke8 Kd6 11 Kd8 +-.

Kd7 10 Ke5! Ke7 11 h4! +- See also Christiansen, Hecht in CBM 55. back Variation of A.Ryskin - Y.Zeziulkin Czestochowa 1992 The position is nearly closed, so despite the two extra pawns White has to act very carefully to penetrate with his king in a winning way:
1 Kd2
Kingside penetration fails: 1 Kf3?! Ke6 2 g5? fxg5! 3 Kg4 Kf6! 4 g3 Ke6! =. An attempt on the queenside without support of the king doesn't work either: 1 c4? b4! =; 1 b4? cxb4! 2 Kd3 (2 cxb4 =) 2...bxc3 3 Kxc3 (3 bxc3?

White has advanced to the key squares of the e5-pawn. back V.Smyslov - W.Watson New York 1987 In contrast to the last example, here the side that has a material advantage isn't able to win because the activity of the white king prevents a penetration on the queenside, while the centre and kingside are closed: 1 a3! 1 h3?

5...g1B =. The blocked pawns on a2 and a3 build a familiar fortress against the
'right' (controlling the queening square) bishop. White only has to oscillate between b1 and c2. 5...g1R is stalemate.
6 Kg6 Ne2 7 Kf5 Nc3 8 Ke5! Nxa2
To win, Black would have to protect his passed pawn from b5 or c4, but he can't manage that.
9 Kd4! Nc1 10 Kc3! Kxh7 11 Kc2 a2 12 Kb2! =
◼ This stalemate idea has been used in a whole lot of studies (see, e.g., ECE 232, 338, 1171, 1424, 1541, 1610; also ECE 1585 shows a related idea). Especially ECE 1396 (Lazard, 1924) should be mentioned, in which there are white pawns at b3 and b4 and a black pawn at b5 instead of the a2- and a3- pawns. back 7: Pawns on One Wing One can recognize a lot of similarities to our findings of Chapter 2. Especially the difference between critical and key squares here plays an important role. Also the activity of the kings is very important. In this connection the reader should study 7.09 very carefully. Since there are more pawns on the board, a counter-attack is rather more promising than in Chapter 2 (see 7.02). The importance of the stalemate ideas shown in Chapter 6 becomes clear in 7.08. This example should be studied carefully as well. A) Fixed Pawn-Structure B) Flexible Pawn-Structure C) Passive Defence D) Active Defence / Counter-attack E) Extra Pawn A) Fixed Pawn-Structure Naturally the king is only able to capture the base of the pawn-chain: Here the g6-pawn is the base of the pawn-chain (f4 and h4 are the white base pawns) with the critical squares f6, e6 and d6. There are two more critical squares, which we didn't consider in Chapter 2, namely d7 and d8 (in general those two squares from the outside critical square in the direction to the 8th rank). If one doesn't have to take account of a counter-attack towards one's own base, then in general the critical squares are also the key squares, because after capturing the enemy base, the other pawns will also fall.
1 Kd5! Ke7 2 Ke5!
As we already know, in the fight for three adjacent key squares, only taking the opposition on the main line leads to success. 2 Kc6? would be wrong, since after
2...Ke6! Black has the lateral opposition: 3 Kc5 Ke7! (diagonal opposition) 4
Kd5 Kd7! (normal opposition) 5 Ke5 Ke7! =. After 2 Kc5? Ke6! 3 Kc6 Ke7! 4 Kc7 White has the lateral opposition and so conquers one of the critical squares. However, it turns out that Black can save himself with a counterattack. d8 is therefore the only critical square that is not a key square. 4...Ke6! 5 Kd8!? Kd5!
6 Ke7 Ke4! 7 Kf6 Kxf4! 8 Kxg6 Ke4 9 Kxh5 f4! 10 g6 f3! 11 g7 f2! 12 g8Q
f1Q! =. With accurate defence, the h-pawn is not enough to win.
2...Kf7 3 Kd6! Kf8 4 Ke6! Kg7 5 Ke7! Kg8 6 Kf6! Kh7 7 Kf7! Kh8 8 Kxg6!
+- If Black is to move in 7.01, he can make a simple draw by 1...Kc6 (except for
1...Kc7?, every move is playable - even 1...Ke7?!).
Usually a counter-attack is possible if the top of the defender's pawn-chain is far-advanced:
1...Kd6!
1...Kf6? 2 Kf4! Ke6 (now the counter-attack is too late because the white king is
nearer the h5-pawn; 2...Kg6 3 Ke5! +-) 3 Kg5! Ke5 4 Kxh5! Kf5 5 Kh6 Ke4 6 Kg5 Kf3 7 h5! Kxg3 8 h6! Kf3 9 h7! g3 10 h8Q! g2 11 Qd4 and White wins.
2 Kf5 Kd5! 3 Kg5 Ke4! 4 Kxh5! Kf3! 5 Kg5 Kxg3! 6 h5! Kf3! 7 h6 g3! 8 h7
g2! 9 h8Q g1Q+! = ◼ A further example of such a counter-attack is O.Romanishin-A.Anastasian, Moscow Olympiad 1994: wKd3,Pe2,f3,g4; bKb5,Pe5,f4,g5: 1...Kb4!! 2 e3!? Kb3 3 exf4 exf4! 4 Ke4 Kc3 5 Kf5 Kd3 6 Kxg5 Ke3! 7 Kh4 Kxf3! 8 g5 Ke2 1⁄2- 1⁄2. The following pawn-structure is also of great importance: The pawns are fixed since a move with the g-pawn would obviously mean suicide. The big difference from 7.01 is the fact that White doesn't control f6. This changes the key square situation. These are f6, e6, e7 and e8. d6 here doesn't belong since Black is able to get the side opposition:
1...Kf7! 2 Kd6 Kf6! 3 Kd7 Kf7! 4 Kd8 Kf8! 5 Kc7 Ke7!
5...Kg7? 6 Kc6! (since now Black can't get the distant opposition, he loses the
fight for the key squares on the e-file) 6...Kf6 7 Kd6! Kf7 8 Kd7! Kf8 9 Ke6! Kg7 10 Ke7! Kg8 11 Kf6! Kh7 12 Kf7! Kh6 13 Kg8! +-.
6 Kc6 Ke6! =
If one moves 7.03 to the left, there is an additional drawing possibility: Here only f8, f7 and the f6-pawn itself are key squares because the h-file gives Black enough space to keep the opposition:
1...Kh6!!
In order to prevent the white king from encircling the base (f6), Black has to take the distant opposition. Not 1...Kh8? 2 Kc6! Kg8 3 Kd6! Kf8 4 Ke6! Kg7 5 Ke7! Kg6 6 Kf8! +-.
2 Kc7 Kg7! 3 Kb7 Kh7!
3...Kf7? 4 Kb6! Kg6 5 Kc6! Kh7 6 Kd7! Kh6 7 Ke8! Kg7 8 Ke7! +-.
4 Kb8 Kh8! 5 Kc8 Kg8! 6 Kd7 Kh7! 7 Ke6 Kg6! =
We will discuss the corresponding squares in 12.03. If one moves 7.03 up the board, the position is a clear draw: White is not able to go round the base g7. Therefore also the opposition doesn't play a role since there are only two key squares, g7 and g8.
1...Kf8! 2 Kd7 Kf7
2...Kg8 3 Ke8 Kh7 4 Kf7 Kh8! 5 Kf8 = (5 Kg6?? Kg8 -+).
3 Kd8 Kf8 =
B) Flexible Pawn-Structure Since there are still pawn moves available, both sides have more options: V.Rührig - J.Dueball Bundesliga 1985/6 In contrast to 7.03 an encirclement wouldn't help White because Black escapes with a pawn exchange:
1...Kf6 2 Ke8 g5!?
With this thematic counter Black reduces the material in such a way that not enough remains. 2...Kg7 3 Ke7 Kh6 4 Kf6 Kh7! (4...Kh5? 5 Kg7! g5 6 Kf6! +- (2.04)) 5 Kf7 Kh6! 6 Kg8 g5! 7 Kf7 gxf4! 8 gxf4! Kh7! = (2.07); 2...Ke6 3 Kf8 Kf6! 4 Kg8 g5! 5 Kh7 gxf4! 6 gxf4! =.
3 Kd7 gxf4 4 gxf4! Kf7 5 Kd6 Kf6 6 Kd5 Kf7 7 Ke5 Ke7 1⁄2-1⁄2
An exchange that makes the defence easier is impossible in the following study: N.Grigoriev Sbornik etiudov, published 1954 Black's pawn-chain is seriously weakened by the advanced h-pawn. Playing ...Kf7-f6 followed by ...g5 wouldn't help because White could close things up by h4 and advance to the key squares of the f5-pawn. Also the exchanging attempt ...h4 just fails, as we will see later. Finally, the white h-pawn gives two extra tempi, which are both needed for White to win:
1 Kf2!
1 Kg2? Ke7 2 Kh3 (2 Kf3 Kd6 3 Ke3 Kc5 =) 2...Ke6 (2...Kf6? 3 Kh4! Kf7 4
Kg5! Kg7 5 h3! Kf7 6 Kh6! Kf6 7 h4 +- (7.03)) 3 Kh4 Kf6! 4 h3 Kf7! 5 Kg5 Kg7! 6 h4 Kf7! (6...Kh7? 7 Kf6! Kh6 8 Ke6 +-) 7 Kh6! Kf6! =. In order to win this way, White would need three extra tempi: one to get to g5, one for Kh6 and another one for going round the black king.
1...Kf7 2 Ke3! Ke6
2...Kf6 3 Kd4 g5 4 h4! +-; 2...Kg7 3 Kd4! h4 4 gxh4! Kh6 5 Ke5! Kh5 6 Kf6!
Kxh4 7 Kxg6! Kg4 8 h4! +-. This line shows that the starting position with the black king on f8 would be drawn.
3 Kd4! Kd6 4 h3!
White uses the first spare tempo to get his king to the 5th rank.
4...Ke6 5 Kc5! Ke7
5...Kd7 6 Kd5! Ke7 7 Ke5 Kf7 8 Kd6 +-.
6 Kc6!
6 Kd5? Kd7 (6...Kf6 7 Kd6 Kf7! 8 Kd7 Kf6! 9 Ke8 g5! 10 h4! gxh4 11 gxh4!
Ke6! 12 Kf8! =) 7 Ke5 Ke7! 8 h4 Kf7! 9 Kd6 Kf6! = (7.03); 6 h4? Kd7 7 Kd5 Ke7! 8 Ke5 Kf7! =.
6...Ke6 7 h4!
The second spare tempo enables the white king to go round the black king:
7...Ke7 8 Kc7! Ke6 9 Kd8! Kf7
9...Kd5 10 Ke7 Ke4 11 Kf6 Kf3 12 Kxg6! Kxg3 13 Kg5! +-.
10 Kd7! Kf8 11 Ke6! +-
◼ The way analogous to 1 Kg2 can be followed in the following study by Grigoriev (ECE 354; the reader should try to solve it himself): wKd1,Pf2,g3,h3; bKc8,Pf5,g6,h5: White to play and win. If the pawn-structure isn't yet seriously weakened, the defender can usually avoid losing: S.Homann - L.Borbjerggaard NATO Ch, Breda 1994 Here there are many ways to draw, although some are quite complicated. Nevertheless (or perhaps because of this), the reader should study them.
1 Kd3
1 a3 is the simplest way:
a) 1...a5?! and now: a1) 2 Kd3 Kf4 3 a4! (3 b4? b6! -+) 3...Kf3 4 Kd2! Kf2 5 Kd3! =. The threatened counter-attack secures the draw. a2) 2 a4 b6 3 Kd3 Kf4 4 Kd2 =. b) 1...a6 2 b4 b6: b1) 3 bxc5? bxc5! 4 a4 a5! -+. b2) 3 b5 axb5 (3...a5 4 a4! =) 4 cxb5!

9 Kxb4! =) 5 b5! a5 6 Kb3! = (6.04).
1...Kf4 2 Kd2
The immediate construction of a stalemate refuge by 2 Kc3 also here seems to be the logical way: 2...Ke3 (2...a5?! 3 Kb2 a4! =; 2...Ke4 3 b4 cxb4+ 4 Kxb4 Kd4 5 a3 a6 6 a4 Kd3 7 c5 Kd4 8 Ka5! =) 3 b4 b6 4 b5 Ke4 5 Kb3 Kd4 6 a3! = (6.04).

3...b6 4 Kd2
4 Kc3 Ke3 5 a3 Ke4 (5...a5 6 a4! =) 6 b4 =.
4...Kf2 5 a3?
For no reason, White weakens his pawn-structure.
5...a6!! (D)
6 Kd3
6 b4 a5! -+.
In the actual game, White lost as follows: 6 a4?! a5! 7 Kd3 Ke1! 8 Kc3 Kd1! 9 Kb2 Kd2! 10 Ka3 Kc3 0-1.
6...Kf3! 7 Kc3
7 Kd2 a5 8 Kd3 a4 9 Kd2 (for 9 bxa4 Kf4! -+, see the main line) 9...Ke4! (not

triangulation; 23...Kd3?! 24 Kc1 c2?? 25 a5! bxa5! 26 a4! =) 24 Kc1 Kc5 25 Kd1 Kd4! (since White can still lose a tempo by a5 and a4, here, in contrast to the example Fahrni-Alapin, d4 is the corresponding square to d1) 26 Kc1 Kd3!

The next example features a similar pawn-structure to that near to the end of
7.08; however, there are totally different variations.
N.Giertz - B.Kamber Suhr 1992 Since here Black still has the spare tempo ...f7-f6 particular precision is necessary. In the game, there followed 1 Ke2? Ke4! 2 Kf2 Kd3! 3 Kf3 f6 4 Kf2 Kd2! 5 Kf3 Ke1! 6 e4 Kf1! 7 e5 fxe5! 8 Ke4 Kf2 0-1 (because of 9 Kxe5 Kg3!
10 Kf5 Kh4! -+). The correct way is:
1 Kf2! Ke4 2 Ke2! f6 3 Kf2! Kd3 4 Kf3! Kc3 5 Ke2
5 Kg3 Kc2 6 Kg2! =; 5 Ke4? Kd2! 6 Kd4 Ke2 7 e4 Kf3 8 Kd5 Kf4! 9 Ke6
Kxe4! -+.

But not 5...Kc2? 6 e4! Kc3 7 e5!! (7 Ke3? Kc4! 8 e5! Kd5! =) 7...fxe5 8 Ke3! +-.
6 Kf2 =
C) Passive Defence In general a passive defence is only sensible if at least one base pawn is still on its starting position, because such a pawn can't be the object of an encircling manoeuvre from behind. Nevertheless, the attacker has a lot of ideas available. An elegant encirclement is shown in the following game: G.Tringov - L.Stein Amsterdam Interzonal 1964 Black uses his active king for a winning penetration that finally leads to the win of the g2-pawn:
1...Ke4 2 Kd2 Kf4! 3 Ke2 Kg3! 4 Kf1 Kh2!
Not 4...Kxh4? 5 Kf2! Kg5 6 g3 =. 0-1 In view of 5 Kf2 Kh1! 6 Kg3 (6 Kf1 g3! -+) 6...Kg1 7 Kf4 Kxg2 -+. If there are no blocked pawns, both sides have more options: M.Botvinnik Shakhmaty v SSSR, 1952 White has a space advantage and the more active king. The three-time world champion demonstrates how to use these advantages for a winning encirclement:
1 Kd5! Kf8

◼ Botvinnik based this study on his analysis of Troianescu-Botvinnik, Budapest 1952. Also in the following example the more active king is decisive: E.Shvidler - F.Maeser Lenk 1991 The weakness of f6 is fatal for Black:

The practical difficulties of such positions are illustrated by the following example from grandmaster practice: P.Schlosser - P.Blatny Brno 1992 Though Black is a little bit better due to his more active king, he really shouldn't be able to win against the best defence.

Kf5 13 f3 =.
6...Kc4 (D)
7 e4? This move is the decisive weakening of the white structure. Again we would like to explain why this is the case. Up to now the e-pawn was protected by the base f2 (which one can't encircle from behind). By e3-e4 White forces himself into f2-f3 with a shifting of the base to the 3rd rank. White could keep the balance with 7 Kd2 Kb3 (7...f5 8 gxf5 gxf5! 9 f3 =; 7...e4 8 Kc2 =) 8 Kd3 f5! 9 gxf5 gxf5! 10 f3 Kb4! 11 f4 = or 7 f3 Kc3 8 e4! Kc2 9 Ke3! Kd1 10 f4! g5! 11 fxg5 fxg5! 12 Kd3!

Ke2 9 Ke6! Ke3 10 Ke5! Kf2 11 Kf6! Kf3 12 Kf5! Kg2 13 Kg6! Kh3 14 Kh5! +- A zigzag course full of exclamation marks. Let's have a look at another practical example, which was annotated by Mufić in Informator 51: Go.Mufić - N.Ferčec Yugoslavia 1991 The active white king fully compensates for Black's extra pawn but it isn't quite enough for a win:
1 Kc5!?
1 Ke5 Kb5 2 Kd6! Kc4 3 Ke7 Kd3 4 Kxf7 Ke2 5 f4 Kf2 6 g3 Kg2 7 Kxg7 h5! 8
Kg6 Kxh2! 9 Kxh5! Kxg3! 10 Kg5! =.
1...e5!!
Black must rely solely on his e-pawn; otherwise he is lost, e.g. 1...h5? 2 f4 intending 3 Kd6 and 4 Ke7 +-. Note that 2 Kd6? squanders a tempo and consequently Black's counterattack is sufficient to draw after 2...Kb4 3 Ke7 Kc3
4 Kxf7 Kd3, etc.
2 g4!?
2 Kd6 Kb5 3 Kxe5 (3 Ke7 e4 4 Kxf7 Kc4 5 Kxg7 Kd3! =) 3...Kc6 = is clearly
drawn. Also White could have tried playing 2 h4!?.
2...Ka4?
This loses the decisive tempo. Again the king wasn't allowed to move: a) 2...f6 3 Kd5 (3 h4 Ka4 =) 3...Kb4 4 Ke6 Kc4 5 Kf7: a1) 5...g6 6 Kxf6 e4! 7 Ke5 (7 Kg7?!

10 Kf6! Ke8 11 Kg7! Ke7 12 f5 +-) 6 Kxe4! (D).
Now we have an endgame with the same number of pawns, in which the bad position of the black king is decisive. b11) 6...Kd2 7 g5 Ke2 8 f4: b111) 8...g6 9 h6! Kf2 10 Ke5 Kf3 11 Kf6 Kxf4 12 Kg7!

1-0 As 12 h4 Kxh4 13 Kf5! wins. We have seen that an extra pawn isn't everything; on the other hand it could have saved half a point. Of course, usually the only question is whether an extra pawn wins. This issue, the realization of an extra pawn on one wing, is the subject of the rest of this chapter. E) Extra Pawn If the pawn-structure and the position of the king are not too compromised the extra pawn wins: R.Wessmann - L.Schneider Gothenburg 1990 Though the black king is in the corner, his activation can't be prevented. The fact that the e-pawn is backward is unimportant thanks to the spare tempi with the g- and h-pawns.
1...Kg8 2 Kc3 Kf7 3 Kc4 Ke7 4 Kc5 Kd7 5 h3 h6 6 h4 h5
6...e5 is also possible at once, but the activation of the king in the game is more
convincing. 7 fxe5 Ke6! 8 Kd4 h5 (not 8...g5? 9 hxg5 hxg5! 10 g4! =) 9 Ke3 Kxe5! 10 Kf3 f4! 11 gxf4+ Kf5 -+.

Kf3 Kd2 14 Kf2 g6 15 Kf3 Ke1! 16 Kg2 Ke2! 0-1 The next example shows an exception, in which one doesn't realize at first sight why the pawn-structure is weakened: I.Maizelis Shakhmaty v SSSR, 1954 If White is to move, he can't change the pawn-structure in his favour because he lacks a spare tempo:
1 Kd4
Both 1 f5+ gxf5+ (1...Kf7?! =) 2 gxf5+ Kf6 = and 1 h5 gxh5! 2 gxh5 Kf6! = lead to a drawn f+h against h-pawn ending, which we have examined in Chapter 5. Also 1 g5 Kd6!: a) 2 h5 gxh5 (2...Ke6 =) 3 f5 h4! 4 Kf4 h3! (4...Kd5? 5 Kg4! Ke5 6 f6! +-) 5 Kg3 Ke5 6 f6 Ke6 7 Kxh3 h6 is a draw. b) 2 f5 gxf5+! 3 Kxf5 Ke7! = leads to nothing.
1...Kd6! 2 Kc4 Kc6! 3 Kc3 Kc7! =
If it is Black to move, he has to retreat by one rank:
1...Kd6

2 Kd4! Ke6 3 Kc5! Ke7

Kxh4 8 Kxg6! +-.
4 Kd5! Kd7 5 Ke5 Ke7
With the king on e5, the transition into an ending with f+h vs h wins: 6 h5
6 g5 Kf7 7 Kd6! Kf8 8 Ke6! Ke8 9 Kf6! Kf8 10 h5! gxh5 11 Ke5!:
a) 11...Ke7 12 f5! h4 (12...Kd7 13 Kf4! Kd6 14 Kg3! +-) 13 Kf4! Kd6 14 Kg4! Ke5 15 f6! Ke6 16 Kxh4! h6 17 Kh5! hxg5 18 Kg6! +-. b) 11...h4 12 Ke4! Ke7 13 Kf3! Ke6 14 Kg4! +-.
6...gxh5 7 gxh5! Kf7 8 Kd6! +- (5.10).
If in the starting position the black h-pawn is at h6, White wins, whoever is to move (ECE 1185; also look at, e.g., 5.08). In the study by Maizelis the pawns were already far advanced. When they are still further back, usually the win should be forced: S.Ludwig - A.Klauser Bad Ragaz 1990 White has already played a4, so the endgame c+a vs a-pawn again is a draw. White therefore has to negotiate some hurdles since the usual procedure 'candidate in front', in order to transform the majority into a passed pawn, doesn't win here. A pawn in a majority is, according to Nimzowitsch, called a candidate if it has no counterpart on its file. The rule 'candidate in front' basically means that at first the candidate should advance as far as possible in order then to be supported by its neighbours to create a passed pawn. This rule especially serves the wish to avoid structures with backward pawns, but in the present case an advance like b4, c4, c5, b5 and c6 only leads to a draw because of 5.10.

back V.Kupreichik - V.Smyslov Moscow 1976 You may have asked yourself why this exercise is to be found in this chapter. The c-pawn is helpless and Black can prevent a penetration on the kingside by ...e4. So a fixed structure is forced, in which the key squares of the e4-pawn play the dominant role:
1 Kg1! Kd7 2 Kf2!
2 e4? Kc6! 3 Kf2 Kxc5! 4 Ke3 Kc4 -+.

f3! 15 h6 f2! 0-1 back 8: Passed Pawns Passed pawns have a special significance in pawn endings because usually the king himself has to deal with them. The restrictive effect of a protected passed pawn and the deflective effect of an outside passed pawn are already familiar to us. Now it's time to enhance our knowledge by examining further aspects: A) Preliminary Considerations B) Battle between Different Passed Pawns B1) Several Passed Pawns on Both Sides B2) Protected Passed Pawn vs Two Passed Pawns B3) Protected Passed Pawn vs One Passed Pawn B4) Outside Passed Pawn C) Passed Pawn vs Candidate A) Preliminary Considerations First we now want to examine the fight between the king and several passed pawns without looking at the attacking king: The king can easily stop two connected passed pawns, but he can't capture one without leaving the square of the front pawn. Of course he is without a chance if Black is able to support his two pawns with his king. On the other hand though, White will capture both pawns if Black has to advance the pawns due to zugzwang. It's a similar case when there is one file between the pawns: By oscillating between g2 and g3, White can easily stop the pawns. But the attempt to capture them fails. This is because in order to capture the pawn that is further back White would have to leave the square of the e-pawn. If he tries to attack the further-advanced pawn from the front, then he will immediately get into zugzwang after 1 Kf1? g3!. If, in the diagram position, Black is forced to advance his pawns, they will again be lost. A new situation arises when there are two files between the pawns: Here the pawns can't protect each other, so with White to move they are lost:
1 Kg3! e3 2 Kf3! h4 3 Kxe3! h3 4 Kf3
The rule of the common square (draw a line from the back pawn to the file of the front pawn and complete it to a square) might serve as a reminder here: if the common square of two passed pawns has reached the 8th (1st) rank, their promotion can't be prevented. This is exactly the case with Black to move. One of the pawns queens:
1...h4!
The common square has reached the first rank; that's why the pawns go through on their own.
2 Kf2 h3! 3 Kg3 e3! 4 Kxh3 e2!
If there are three files between the pawns, they can again protect each other. The following position is critical: White shouldn't try to capture one of the pawns but has to keep both options by playing 1 Kf4! and an oscillation between f4, f5 and f6. Black only loses the pawns if he has to push them forward: 1 Kf4! (1 Ke4? h5! 2 Kf4 d5!) 1...d5 2 Ke5! h5 3 Kxd5! h4 4 Ke4!. If Black has the right to move, one of the pawns will queen: 1...d5 2 Kf4 h5! (the common square of the pawns has reached the first rank) 3 Kf5 h4 4 Kg4 d4!
5 Kxh4 d3!.
Pawns that are separated by four or more files normally can't be stopped by the king alone. However, we still want to analyse how he deals with three connected passed pawns: Averbakh Usually three passed pawns are too much for the sole king, but if they are not too far advanced at least he can create a zugzwang position:
1 Kg1!
1 Kf1? h3! and the pawns are unstoppable.
1...f3
1...g3 2 Kg2! is a reciprocal zugzwang.
2 Kf2! h3 3 Kg3!
If now Black has a spare move (e.g. with the king) the pawns go through on their own; if not, then the pawns are all lost:
3...h2 4 Kxh2! f2 5 Kg2! g3 6 Kf1! g2+ 7 Kxg2 f1Q+ 8 Kxf1!
If it is Black to move, the pawns go through, even without any spare moves:
1...g3!
Zugzwang!
2 Kg1 h3 3 Kh1 f3 4 Kg1 f2+ 5 Kf1 h2! 6 Kg2 h1Q+ 7 Kxh1 f1Q#
◼ Averbakh discusses the issue of 8.01E far more extensively (442-59). B) Battle Between Different Passed Pawns After these somewhat dry preliminary considerations the black king is now back. It's difficult to formulate any general rules for the following, as what counts is the exact calculation of variations. B1) Several Passed Pawns on Both Sides B2) Protected Passed Pawn vs Two Passed Pawns B3) Protected Passed Pawn vs One Passed Pawn B4) Outside Passed Pawn B1) Several Passed Pawns on Both Sides If both sides have connected passed pawns, the game usually ends in a draw, except when they are so far advanced that they can be promoted with the help of the king: N.Kopaev Shakhmaty v SSSR, 1947 If the king blocks two connected passed pawns, he can't lose a tempo without allowing them to advance. Therefore White has to act carefully in order to block them at the right moment. With some elegant king manoeuvres he finally succeeds:
1 Kc5!
1 Kb5? d5! 2 Kc5 d4! 3 Kc4 Kg8! 4 Kd3 Kf7 5 Ke4 Kg8! 6 Kf5 Kf7! =.
1...e4 2 Kc4!
2 Kd4? d5! 3 Ke3 Kg8! 4 Kf4 Kf7! 5 Kg5 e3! 6 Kh6! e2! 7 Kh7! e1Q 8 g8Q+!
Kxf6 9 Qf8+ Kg5! 10 Qd8+ =.
2...d6 3 Kc3! Kg8 4 Kd4 d5 5 Ke3! Kf7 6 Kf4! Kg8 7 Kg5! Kh7
7...Kf7 8 Kh6! e3 9 Kh7! and White wins.
8 Kf5! e3 9 Ke6! e2 10 Kf7! +-
The following example is very concrete and plays in a beautiful way with the theme: check and avoiding check. A.Khachaturov Shakhmaty v SSSR, 1947 Neither king can stop the opponent's pawns. The resulting race ends in White's favour since he queens with check: 1 f5! 1 h5? g3 2 Ke1 d4 3 h6! d3 4 h7 g2 5 Kf2 d2 6 h8Q g1Q+ 7 Kxg1! d1Q+! 8 Kf2 Qd2+! 9 Kf3 Qd3+ 10 Kg4 Qd1+ 11 Kg5 Qg1+! 12 Kf5 Qb1+! 13 Ke6 Qa2+! = and Black has a perpetual check.
1 Ke1? d4! (1...Kc3? 2 h5! d4 3 h6! Kc2 4 h7 d3 5 h8Q d2+ 6 Kf2! d1Q 7 Qh7+
Kc3 8 Qe4! +/-) 2 f5 (2 h5 g3 3 h6! g2 4 Kf2! d3! =) 2...Kc3 3 f6 d3 4 f7 Kc2! 5 f8Q d2+! 6 Kf2 d1Q! +=.

3...d4 4 f6! Kd6 5 h6! g2 6 Kf2! d3 7 f7! Ke7 8 h7! d2 9 f8Q+! Kxf8 10 h8Q+!
+- For the following examples, our preliminary considerations again prove to be useful: P.Carrera, 1617 The black king is in zugzwang, so even his three passed pawns can't help him:
1 Kf4 f6
1...f5 2 Kg3 +-.
2 Kg3! f5 3 Kg2
3 Kf4? h4! 4 Ke5 h3! 5 Kd6 h2! 6 Kd7 h1Q 7 c7+ Ka7! -+.
3...h4 4 Kh2 f4
4...g3+ 5 Kh3! g2 6 Kxg2! f4 7 Kf2 h3 8 Kf3 +-; 4...h3 5 Kg3! f4+ 6 Kh2! f3 7
Kg3! +-.
5 Kg1!
5 Kg2? g3! 6 Kf3 h3! -+.
5...h3 6 Kh2! f3 7 Kg3! +-
All the pawns are lost due to zugzwang. It remains to say that Black's loss was only due to his fatal immobile king position. The next example, which is of the same age, is much more difficult. The large number of similar and unclear variations caused at least us great difficulties (quote by Averbakh: "There are a lot more variations but they are all quite simple."). P.Carrera, 1617; Maizelis, 1956 Again it is White who wins by getting his opponent into zugzwang on both wings:
1 Ke2
1 a4 +- is also possible immediately.
1...Kd7 2 Kf3 Kc6 3 a4!
3 Kg4? Kb5 =; 3 c4?? Kc5! 4 b3 h5! -+.
3...h5 4 c4! f5 5 Kg3!
5 a5? is premature. Black plays 5...h4 and now: a) 6 b4? even loses if Black responds correctly: a1) 6...g5? (now White wins!) 7 Kf2!! (7 b5+? Kb7 8 c5 Kb8! 9 Kg2 f4! -+; 7 a6?

As before, neither side is allowed to move the knight's pawn because the flexibility of the double step would be lost.

B2) Protected Passed Pawn vs Two Passed Pawns The assessment of such examples mainly depends on the place of the square of the protected passed pawn. If the protected passed pawn is already far advanced or the square is far away from the attacker's passed pawns, then the position is usually drawn. Otherwise there are good winning chances: J.Kling and B.Horwitz, 1851 Though the d4-pawn limits the radius of the white king it can't prevent him from leading his connected passed pawns to their target:
1 Ke4 Kg4 2 h4 Kh5 3 Kf4 Kh6 4 g4 Kg6 5 h5+ Kh6 6 Ke4
Notice that White can move freely within the square while Black is stuck at h6 and g5.
6...Kg5 7 Kf3 Kh6 8 Kf4 Kh7 9 g5 Kg7 10 g6
10 h6+? Kg6 11 Kg4 Kh7! =.
10...Kh6
10...Kf8 11 h6 Kg8 12 Kf5 d3 13 Kf6 +-.
11 Kg4 Kg7 12 Kg5!
In order to make any progress White has to leave the square.
12...d3 13 h6+! Kg8 14 Kf6!
14 g7? Kf7! -+.
14...d2 15 h7+! Kh8 16 Kf7 d1Q 17 g7+! Kxh7 18 g8Q+! Kh6 19 Qg6#
◼ If in the starting position the d4-pawn were at b4 or if one moves the position to the left it would be a draw, as the reader can verify by himself. If there are still more pawns on the board there are also more possibilities. Alekhine had no great problems winning the following position: P.Keres - A.Alekhine Dresden 1936 Due to the passed d-pawn being protected in an unusual way, there are even two basically very different ways to win. Alekhine won the game after a transition into a winning queen ending by pushing through the g-pawn with the help of the king. Grigoriev later showed that he also had the option of attacking the base of the d5-pawn by playing ...a6 and ...b5.
1...Kf6 2 Ke3 Kf5 3 Kf2 e4 4 Ke2 g3 5 Ke3 Kg4
5...Ke5 6 Ke2 Kd6 7 Ke3 Kc7 8 Ke2 Kb7 9 Ke3 a5 10 bxa6+ Kxa6! 11 Ke2 Kb7
12 Ke3 Kc7 13 Ke2 Kd6 14 Ke3 b5 15 cxb5 Kxd5 and Black wins (Grigoriev).
6 d6 g2! 7 Kf2 Kh3! 8 d7 e3+
8...Kh2?! 9 d8Q g1Q+! 10 Ke2 Qg2+ -+.
9 Kf3 g1Q! 10 d8Q Qf2+ 11 Ke4 e2! 12 Qd7+ Kg2 13 Qg4+ Kf1 0-1
It's time to give an example in which the protected passed pawn draws: A.V.Ivanov - T.Mirabile New York Open 1994 The best that White can get is an equal queen ending. To make any progress at all, he must first create passed pawns on the queenside:
1 Ke2 Ke6 2 Kd3
The creation of a second isolated passed pawn doesn't help either: 2 a4 bxa4! 3 bxa4! Kd7 4 a5 Kc6 5 a6! Kc7 6 Kd3 Kc6 7 Kc4 Kc7 8 Kb5?! d3! 9 c6! d2! 10 a7! d1Q! 11 a8Q! Qd3+ 12 Kc5! Qd4+ 13 Kb5 Qd3+ =.
2...Kd7 3 b4 Kc6 4 Kc2 h5 5 h4 Kb7 6 Kb3 Kc6 7 a4 bxa4+! 8 Kxa4!
Now the connected passed pawns are on the board but they are not sufficient for a win.
8...Kb7 9 b5 Kb8 10 b6 Kb7! 11 Kb4 Kc6 12 Kc4 Kb7!
Now White has to leave the square of the d-pawn to make any progress. In a practical game one should of course make sure that one doesn't lose because from this moment on everything is quite forced.
13 Kb5!? d3 14 c6+! Kb8 15 Ka6!
15 b7? Ka7! -+ (15...d2?? 16 Kb6! d1Q 17 c7#!).
15...d2! 16 c7+! Kc8! 17 Ka7 d1Q! 18 b7+! Kxc7! 19 b8Q+! Kd7?!
Easier was 19...Kc6 20 Qb6+ (20 Qc8+ Kb5! 21 Qe8+ Kc4 22 Qxe5 Qd4+ =)
20...Kd7 21 Kb7 Qd4 (21...Qd6?? 22 Qxd6+! Kxd6 23 Kb6! +-) 22 Qc6+ Ke7 =
and White can't make any progress.
20 Qxe5 Kc6 21 Qc3+ Kb5 22 e5
22 Qb2+ Kc4 23 Qa2+ Kc5 24 Qa5+ Kc6 25 Qb6+ Kd7 26 Kb7 Qa4 is also a
draw.
22...Qd7+ 23 Kb8 Qd8+ 24 Kb7 Qb6+ 25 Kc8
Now the transition back into a pawn ending secures the draw at once.
25...Qc6+!? 26 Qxc6+! Kxc6! 1⁄2-1⁄2
B3) Protected Passed Pawn vs One Passed Pawn In the fight versus a single passed pawn, the protected passed pawn nearly always has the advantage. But with reduced material this advantage is only sufficient for a win if its square doesn't allow the opponent's king to defend its own pawn: K.Bjerring - S.Conquest Copenhagen 1990 This position is a typical example of a draw:
1 a4 Kb6 2 Kc3 Kc5 3 Kb3! Kd4!? 4 a5!
Not 4 Kb4? Kxe5! 5 Kc5 d4! 6 Kc4 Ke4! 7 a5 d3! 8 a6 d2! 9 a7 d1Q! 10 a8Q+ Qd5+! -+. 1⁄2-1⁄2 In view of 4...Kc5! 5 Ka4! Kc6 6 Kb4! Kb7 7 Kb5 Ka7 8 a6. On the other hand, the strength of a protected passed pawn shouldn't be underestimated: M.Zinar, 1984 In this case the critical square e5 of the b5-pawn is not in the square of the a5- pawn, so that if Black is to move, he loses at once. Thus it is necessary for White to shift the right to move to Black. This can be managed by the following fine manoeuvres:
1 Kf2
1 Kf4? Kd4! 2 a6 e3! 3 Kf3 Kd3! 4 a7 e2! 5 a8Q e1Q! 6 Qd5+ Kc3 7 Qxb5 =.
1...Kc6 2 Kg2 Kd6 3 Kh3
3 Kg3?! Kd5 doesn't help White.
3...Kc6 4 Kg4 Kd5 5 Kg3! Kc6 6 Kf4! Kd5 7 Ke3! +-
The position with white pawns at a4 and b5 and black pawns at a5 and e4 would be a draw: 1 Kf4 Kd4! 2 b6 e3! 3 Kf3 Kd3! =. N.Grigoriev Shakhmaty, 1922 Here again the protected passed pawn is enough for a win because the black king is too restricted in his freedom to manoeuvre. But the position would be drawn if one moved it below or to the left edge of the board, and White to move wouldn't be able to win if one moved it one file to the right. Obviously Black to move loses immediately. Against the king at f4 Black thus has to move to f6, and if the king is at h4 he has to move to g6. It follows that Kg3 must be answered by ...Kg7. There is no square that corresponds with g2, so Black can't keep the corresponding squares (see Chapter 12).

Now we have the starting position with Black to move and it is over:
5...Kg6 6 e7! Kf7 7 Kxf5! Kxe7 8 Kg6! +-
If there are still more pawns on the board, the protected passed pawn becomes stronger, because the critical squares are usually also key squares (see Chapter 7). R.Fine Basic Chess Endings, 1941 This position, which was proposed by Fine in order to demonstrate the superiority of a protected passed pawn, is very much deeper than one would think at first sight. In fact White can win but this is not at all easy to manage:

Ke6! Ke8 25 f7+! Kf8 26 Kf6! h4 27 gxh4! h5 28 Ke6 +- ◼ Averbakh presents the rich story of 8.12 in more detail. B4) Outside Passed Pawn If both sides have a passed pawn, the one with the passed pawn that is further away from the other pawns usually has the advantage. The following instructive example is typical: M.Euwe Deutsche Schachzeitung, 1940 White wins due to the outside passed pawn but he has to be precise:
1 h4 Kf5
1...f5 2 Kf3 +-; 1...f6 2 Kf3 Kf5 3 Kg3 Ke4 4 h5! Kf5 5 Kh4 Ke6 6 h6 Kf7 7
Kh5! +-.
2 Kf3! Ke5 3 Kg4! Ke4 4 h5 f5+ 5 Kh3!!
Only this beautiful move, suggested by Euwe in Das Endspiel, leads to a win. Black's counterplay in a queen ending should be sufficient for a draw: 5 Kg5? f4! 6 h6! f3! 7 h7! f2! 8 h8Q! f1Q! 9 Qe8+ Kd4 10 Qd8+ Ke4 (10...Ke5?? 11 Qd5#!) 11 Qd5+ Ke3 12 Qe6+ Kd4! 13 Qxb6 Qf8! 14 Qc7 (14 Qf6+?? Qxf6+!

5...Ke5 6 Kg3 Ke6 7 Kf4 Kf6 8 h6! Kg6 9 h7 Kxh7 10 Kxf5! +-
Of course, an outside passed pawn can be outweighed by other factors: N.Nikčević - I.Farago Rome 1990 Though Black has the outside passed pawns on the a-file and he can undermine the c5-pawn by ...e6-e5 White can still keep the balance due to his more active king:
1...Kf8! 2 Kc4 a6

C) Passed Pawn vs Candidate Here the ideas basically can be compared to the ones we have just dealt with, but the majority allows new options for the defence, e.g. the exchange of all pawns. Normally though these resources are not sufficient: R.Fischer - B.Larsen Denver Candidates (5) 1971 The black king himself has to deal with the outside passed pawn and is therefore deflected from the defence of his own kingside pawns. White only has to avoid Black using his majority to exchange all the pawns:
1 Kd4 Kd6 2 a5 f6 3 a6 Kc6 4 a7
4 h4 Kb6 5 Kd5! Kxa6 6 Ke6! g5 7 Kxf6! gxh4 8 gxh4! Kb6 9 Kg5 Kc6 10
Kxh5! Kd7 11 Kg6 Ke7 12 Kg7! +-.
4...Kb7 5 Kd5 h4!? 6 Ke6
Or 6 gxh4 Kxa7 7 Ke6! f5 8 h5! f4 (8...gxh5 9 Kxf5! Kb6 10 Kg5! Kc6 11 Kxh5! Kd7 12 Kg6 Ke7 13 Kg7! +-) 9 hxg6! f3 10 g7! f2 11 g8Q! f1Q 12 Qf7+! +-. 1-0 In view of 6...f5 7 Kf6 hxg3 8 hxg3 +-. What kind of traps lurk in such positions is shown in the following grandmaster game: M.Gurevich - M.Krasenkow Jakarta 1996 Black can hold the position if he acts very precisely. Usually it proves to be a good idea to push forward the a-pawn in order to gain space on the queenside and to bring about pawn exchanges. It also has to be noticed that all White's pawns still have the option of a double step. This is important when zugzwang plays a role and it also causes Black to be careful with his b-pawn.
1 Kf3 Kf6 2 Ke4
2 Kf4!? and then:
a) 2...a5? is premature because after 3 a4 (3 b3? b5 4 Ke4 Ke6! 5 Kd4 Kd6! 6 a4 c5+ 7 Kc3 bxa4! 8 bxa4! Kd5 =) 3...b5 4 Ke4! Ke6 5 Kd4!, 5...Kd6 fails to 6 b4! +- (compare 9.09), while 5...bxa4 6 Kc5 Kd7 7 f3!! +- results in a position of reciprocal zugzwang. Note that then 7...Kc7 8 f4! is a further mutual zugzwang. We shall see more of this position later. b) 2...Ke6! 3 Ke4 (3 Kg5 a5! 4 a4 b5 =) 3...Kf6! is more solid; compare the game continuation. For instance, 4 Kd4 Ke6! 5 Kc5 Kd7! 6 f4 = transposes to note 'c2' to White's 6th move.
2...Ke6 3 Kf4 Kf6
3...a5!? (Krasenkow in CBM 57) 4 Kg5 a4! 5 f4 a3 6 bxa3 = (6 b3?! c5 7 Kg6

4 Ke4 Ke6 5 f3 Kf6?!
5...a5 = is safe now that the white pawn is on f3; see note 'a1' to Black's 6th
move below.
6 Kf4
Krasenkow's suggestion 6 Kd4!? (D) is an interesting alternative. Then Black is once again on the brink of disaster but he can just manage to survive: a) 6...Kf5? 7 Kc5!: a1) 7...Ke6 8 f4! Kd7 9 f5! Ke7 10 a4! (10 f6+? Kd7! 11 f7 b6+! 12 Kd4! Ke7!

6...b6? (D)
Under pressure, Krasenkow makes a serious mistake. 6...a5 is correct: a) 7 Ke4: a1) 7...Ke6 8 a4 b5! = (8...Kf6? 9 f4 Ke6 10 f5+ Kf6 11 Kd4! Kxf5 12 Kc5! Ke5
13 Kb6! Kd6 14 Kxb7! +- (7.08A)) transposes to line 'b'.
a2) 7...a4 =. b) 7 a4 b5 8 Ke4 Ke6 9 Kd4 bxa4! (9...Kd6? 10 b4! +-) 10 Kc5 Kd7! = reaches the reciprocal zugzwang mentioned earlier, but now with White to play. The logic is that a move by either White's king or f-pawn means that Black's king produces faster counterplay; note that 11 f4 must be met by 11...Kc7! with a further zugzwang. We now return to 6...b6? (D):
7 Ke4! Ke6
7...a5 8 a4! Ke6 9 f4! +-.
8 f4! a5
8...a6 9 f5+ Kf6 10 a3! (10 Kf4? c5 11 Ke4 b5 =) 10...a5 11 a4! +-; 8...c5 9 f5+
Kf6 10 a3! c4 (10...b5 11 Kd5! b4 12 a4! +-) 11 a4 a6 12 Kd5! Kxf5 13 Kc6! +- (Ftačnik in CBM 56). 9 f5+

9...Kd6
9...Kf6 10 a4! (D) is reciprocal zugzwang since Black has created a barrier that
doesn't allow the white king to penetrate but he has no moves left. Since the white pieces have also taken ideal positions (playing b3 would make the exchange of the queenside easier), White to move couldn't win. One should remind oneself of this position during the analysis. 10...b5 (10...Kf7 11 Ke5! Ke7 12 f6+! Kd7 13 Kf5 Ke8 14 Ke6 +-) 11 axb5! cxb5 12 Kd4 Kxf5 13 Kc5! and White wins.
10 Kf4?
Gurevich returns the favour. Instead 10 a4! b5 11 axb5 cxb5 12 f6! a4 13 Kf5! b4 14 Kg6! +- would have won.
10...a4 11 Kg5 a3 12 bxa3
12 b3 doesn't win either, as Hecht proved in CBM 56: 12...Ke7! 13 Kg6 Kf8! 14
Kf6 c5! 15 Ke5 b5! 16 Kd5 c4! 17 bxc4! b4!? 18 c5! b3! 19 c6! bxa2 20 c7! a1Q 21 c8Q+! =.

If the defender has a backward pawn, it can easily prove his undoing because it has to move when the attacking pawn reaches the 7th rank supported by its king. A.Aleksandrov - M.Krasenkow New York 1997
1...h3!
Not 1...Kf4? 2 b4! axb4! 3 a5! =. 0-1 Without the troublesome b2-pawn, White could have drawn by 2 Kg1!. As it is, it loses as follows: 2 Kg1 Kg3! 3 Kh1 h2! 4 b3 Kh3! (this zugzwang idea should be memorized well) 5 b4 axb4! 6 a5 b3 7 a6 b2 8 a7 b1Q#. Concerning the material distribution, our final example doesn't quite belong in this context, but here again the accurate use of the pawn majority is decisive: Ye Rongguang - Xie Jun Kuala Lumpur 1994 The doubled pawns make the creation of two connected passed pawns more difficult. One way for White to win involves allowing the b-pawn to promote:

An outside passed pawn or a candidate doesn't have to be advantageous (though most of the time this is of course the case). This example, which is given by Lothar Nicolaiczuk in his book, is thought to be a warning. White even loses because Black can just go through with his central passed pawn:

back W.Gscheidlen - H.J.Hecht Bundesliga 1983/4 The white king is so far deflected from the queenside by the black h-pawn that Black is able to penetrate there. However, White is able to hold the draw as long as he keeps his king active enough.

In view of 9...Kb2 10 b4 Kc3 11 a3 Kxc4 -+. back 9: Breakthrough The breakthrough (one side sacrifices one or several pawns in order to create a powerful passed pawn) is a very important tactical idea in pawn endings. Since the opponent often gets one or more passed pawns as well, there are often sharp variations in which every tempo counts. In order to be saved from surprises, the following features of the position should ring your inner alarm bells or wake up your killer instinct: far-advanced (still flexible) pawn-structures or a space advantage on one wing; weaknesses in the pawn-structure (for example, doubled pawns); a pawn majority; a king being out of the squares of the potential passed pawns. A) Far-Advanced Pawns B) Breakthrough of the Majority C) Creation of Two Passed Pawns D) Breakthrough Possibilities for the Defence A) Far-Advanced Pawns Breakthrough ideas have been known for a long time and so we shall start with a classic: C.Cozio, 1766 The white pawns have crossed the middle of the board and the black king is not in their square - two important signs for a possible breakthrough. 1 b6! cxb6
1...axb6 2 c6! bxc6 3 a6! +-.
2 a6! bxa6 3 c6! +- If Black is to move, he wins by stepping into the square of the c-pawn: 1...Kf5! 2 b6 cxb6! 3 axb6 axb6! -+. Instead 1...b6? = is a draw, while every other move loses (e.g. 1...a6?? 2 c6! +-). A similar picture is shown in the following diagram: This arrangement of pawns was dubbed the quartgrip by Kmoch, and is characterized by the following breakthrough possibility:
1 f5 Kb4 2 g5
2 f6 gxf6 3 exf6 e5 4 g5 hxg5 5 h6! +-.
2...exf5
2...hxg5 3 f6! gxf6 4 h6! +-.
3 g6! fxg6 4 e6! +- If Black is to move, he gets his king back into the square by 1...Kb4! 2 g5 Kc5! - + and wins. Unusual pawn-structures might favour a breakthrough: Svacina - H.Müller Vienna 1941 At first sight Black is in zugzwang. However, the weakened white pawn- structure (the doubled pawns on g2 and g3) and the king who is too far advanced allow a typical breakthrough:
1...f4! 0-1
In view of these lines: 2 gxf4 h4! 3 f5+ Kxf5 4 Kxd5 h3! -+; 2 Kc6 h4 3 gxh4 g3! 4 fxg3 fxe3 -+; 2 Kb4 f3 3 gxf3 h4 4 gxh4 g3 5 fxg3 exf3! -+; 2 exf4 h4! 3 gxh4 g3! 4 fxg3 e3! and Black wins. If White were to move, he could reach the square of the e-pawn by 1 Kb4! and draw. If in 9.03 the g3-pawn were at h4, White would win since then no breakthrough is possible (1...f4 is answered by 2 g3! +-). In the next example it's a doubled pawn that enables Black to make a breakthrough: J.Ambrož - G.Dizdar Trenčianske Teplice 1985 The later majority breakthrough by ...b5-b4 is already visible here, but Black must first improve the situation in the centre and on the kingside:
1...f5! 2 Ke2
After 2 h3 Ke7 3 g4 fxg4 4 hxg4 b5 -+ Black wins by first getting his pawn to a4 and then creating an outside passed pawn on the kingside. White is helpless because he can't engage in any activities. 2 a4!?, with the idea of frustrating Black's plan on the queenside, doesn't save the game either, e.g. 2...Ke7 3 Ke2 Ke6: a) 4 a5 Kd6 5 Kf3 b5 6 axb6 a5!! 7 Ke2 (7 e4 fxe4+ 8 Kxe4 a4! -+) 7...a4 8 Kd2 Kc6! -+. b) 4 Kf3 and then: b1) 4...g5? proves to be premature: 5 e4!? (5 g4? b6! intends ...a6 and ...b5, and after 6 gxf5+ Kxf5 7 e4+ Ke6, White's central phalanx is no match for Black's ability to create passed pawns on both wings) 5...a5! (Black must create a passed pawn without delay; 5...b6? 6 d5+ Ke5 7 exf5 +-) even offers White the luxury of a choice: b11) 6 e5!? Kd7 (6...b5? 7 axb5 a4 8 b6 a3 9 b7 axb2 10 b8Q b1Q 11 Qe8+ Kd5
12 Qd7#; after 6...Kd5?, Black lacks the ...b5 idea, since Qd6# would come at

2...b5 3 Kd2
The more active 3 Kf3 doesn't help White either: 3...a5 4 e4?! b4 -+.
3...Ke7 4 Ke2
White is helpless against Black's plan because his king mustn't be too far away from the queenside.

B) Breakthrough of the Majority If one already has a pawn majority on one wing it's of course easier to create a passed pawn. It is worth noting that it is often better not to play according to the rule 'candidate in front', but to exploit a breakthrough idea. Our next example illustrates a typical procedure: 1 g5! Not 1 f5? gxf5! 2 g5 (2 gxf5 Kc5! =) 2...f4! 3 g6! f3! =. The g-pawn wins an important tempo on its way to the 8th rank. One should keep this idea in mind. The existing structure is very aggressive concerning a breakthrough (f5-f6 threatens to create a far-advanced protected passed pawn and if the white king manages to capture the g6-pawn he is already on a key square of the g5-pawn). The temporary backwardness of the f-pawn is insignificant because of the black king being too far away (a weakness that can't be exploited is no weakness!).
1...Kc5 2 f5! Kd6 3 f6! +-
White wins as in 4.08. If one moves the starting position one file to the right it is a draw because of 6.01H, since a protected passed pawn on g6 doesn't secure a win. The following beautiful study shows an accurate preparation for the breakthrough of a majority: M.Zinar, 1982 The white pawns on the kingside are separated, with the consequence that during the creation of a passed pawn, a dangerous black passed pawn also arises. Therefore first White's king has to be placed in such a way that he is able to stop the black pawns:
1 Kb3!
1 Kb4? c5+! 2 Kc3 Kc6 3 f5 gxf5! 4 h5! f4! 5 h6 f3! 6 Kd2 c4! 7 h7 c3+! =.
1...c5
1...Kc5?! 2 f5! +-.
2 Kc2! c4 3 Kd1!! Kc5
Only now does the breakthrough decide: 4 f5! gxf5 5 h5! f4 6 h6! +- There are also a great many games featuring this type of idea. E.Geller - V.Smyslov USSR Ch (Moscow) 1952 In this example Black need be in no hurry, and should plan the best time to make a breakthrough on the kingside. A very important nuance is a possible promotion with check at g1. In the end, Smyslov actually breaks through with his h-pawn.
1...h5!?
1...f4?! 2 gxf4 gxf4! 3 Kd4 Kf5! (3...Kd6? 4 h4! f3 5 Ke3! Kc5 6 Kxf3! Kb4! 7

Black.

5 f5+ Kd7! 6 g5 h3 7 g6 Ke7 8 bxa5 h2 9 a6 h1Q 10 Kb6 Kd6 0-1 C) Creation of Two Passed Pawns The idea of using a breakthrough to create two widely separated passed pawns occurs quite often as well. In the first position, doubled pawns seem to be the cause: A.Wohl - S.Solomon Australian Ch 1985 The d-pawn deflects the black king so that the breakthrough on the kingside leads to a win: 1 d5!! 1 dxe5? Ke6 2 f4 Kd5 3 Ke3 Kc4 only draws.
1...Kd6
The game actually finished 1...e4 2 g4 1-0. The following line was given by Rogers in Informator 41. 2 g4! fxg4 3 fxg4! Kxd5 4 gxh5! Ke6 5 h6! Kf6 6 h5! +- By the way, without the f7-pawn 1 dxe5! wins, while 1 d5? only leads to a draw. The reader should keep in mind the following idea so that he isn't unpleasantly surprised: A.Kharlov - T.Ernst Haninge 1992 After Black's last move, ...g5?, Kharlov became serious: 1 g4!! hxg4
1...gxh4 2 gxh5! h3 3 Kf2 and White wins.
2 h5! The white pawns can't be stopped.
2...f5 3 h6 f4+ 4 Kf2 g3+ 5 Kg2 Ke4 6 h7 1-0
D) Breakthrough Possibilities for the Defence Of course the mere threat of a breakthrough can dictate the flow of play. The following example is characteristic: L.Psakhis - G.Kasparov Murcia (3) 1990 The optional breakthrough f4 indirectly protects the h3-pawn and prevents the black king from going round the f3-pawn from behind. Therefore Garry couldn't try to win any longer.
1...Kg2
1...Kxh3? 2 Kf2! h6 3 f4! exf4 4 e5! dxe5 5 d6 +-.
2 Ke3! Kg3! 1⁄2-1⁄2
In our last example, the threat of a breakthrough devalues a pawn majority: K.Müller, 1996 After 1 h5! the black majority cannot create a passed pawn on its own, so White wins:
1...Kc6
1...f6?! (now the black kingside pawns are completely devalued; not even ...g5
followed by ...f5 is still possible) 2 Kd3 Kb4 3 Kd4! Kxa5 4 c5 Kb5 5 Kd5! +-. Though the advance 1...g5 fits well into the chapter on breakthroughs, it does lose: 2 Kd3! f6 (2...Kb4 3 Kd4! Kxa5 4 c5 +-) 3 Ke4 Kxc4 4 Kf5! Kb5 5 Kxf6 +-.
1...g6 2 g5!! hxg5 3 h6! +- is the main idea of 1 h5.
2 Kd4! Kd6 3 c5+! Kc6
3...Ke6 4 Ke4! g5 (4...Kf6 5 Kd5! +-) 5 Kd4 f5 6 gxf5+! Kxf5 7 Kd5 +-.
4 Kc4! g5 5 Kd4! f5 6 gxf5! g4 7 f6 +-
If Black is to move, he must immediately create a passed pawn; otherwise he can't hold the position:
1...h5!!
1...Kd6? 2 Kd4! h5 3 c5+ Kc6 4 gxh5! +-; 1...g5? 2 h5 f6 3 Kd3! Kb4 4 Kd4

-+ 0-1 back F.Cruz - Y.Seirawan Moscow Olympiad 1994 The black f- and h-pawns are backward, but they are also far-advanced and the white king is far away on the queenside.

back 10: Pawns on Both Wings Now that we have made ourselves familiar with the fundamental techniques and methods, we move on to examples with pawns on both wings, which are very important from a practical point of view. The next two chapters are dedicated to this issue and we have arranged them as follows. In this chapter there are examples in which outside passed pawns or pawn majorities play the important role; first the extreme cases will be discussed and then pawn-structures which become more and more symmetrical will be dealt with. Chapter 11 deals with the question of whether the kings are able to penetrate. There we will also examine situations in which both sides fight for tempi. A) Extra Pawn B) Majority vs Central Passed Pawn C) Spread Majorities D) Even Distribution of Pawns A) Extra Pawn First, here is an instructive example to warm up: White's plan is very simple: 1) Advance the king as far as possible; 2) Push the queenside pawns forward ('candidate in front'); 3) Because the passed pawn that White creates deflects the black king, the white king can penetrate on the kingside and capture several of the black pawns (transformation of one advantage into another), so that finally the white kingside pawns secure the win.
1 Kf1 Kf8 2 Ke2 Ke7 3 Kd3 Kd6 4 Kc4 Kc6
The first phase of the plan is completed; now White has to create a passed pawn. 5 b4 'Candidate first'. Because of his great superiority, White could also play a4 since it doesn't matter that after ...a5 the b-pawn becomes backward.

13...Kxb6 14 Ke7 f5 15 Kf6 g4 16 Kxf5 g3 17 fxg3 hxg3 18 hxg3 +-
In the following example, Adorjan demonstrates that one can also realize an extra pawn if the circumstances are not so favourable as in the previous example (see Inf 47/637): A.Adorjan - G.Sax Hungary 1989 The extra pawn is a backward, and the pawn sacrifice ...g6-g5 is an important resource for the defence. Nevertheless it is possible to break through as in Chapter 9:
1...Kf6 2 f3! g5+!?
2...Ke6 3 Kg5 Kf7 4 f4 Kg7 5 f5 +-.
3 hxg5+! Kg6 4 Ke5! Kxg5
4...h4 5 Kf4! Kh5 6 g6 +-.

6 Ke6! Kg7
6...h4 7 f5+! Kh7 8 f6 h3 9 f7 h2 10 f8Q +-.
7 f5!
7 Ke7 doesn't make any progress: 7...Kg6 8 Ke6! Kg7.
7...Kf8 (D)
8 b4!! By this beautiful breakthrough Adorjan now brings his queenside majority into play.
8...axb4 9 c5 bxc5
9...b3 10 c6! +-.
10 a5! b3 11 a6! b2 12 a7! b1Q 13 a8Q+! Kg7 14 f6+! In queen endings like this one it is not the number of pawns that counts but how far advanced they are. Thus White is winning even though he is a pawn down, since his f-pawn can't be stopped. However, very accurate play is necessary.
14...Kh6 15 Qh8+ Kg5 16 Qg8+
16 f7? allows Black a perpetual check: 16...Qb3+ 17 Ke7 Qb7+ 18 Kf8 Qb8+ 19 Kg7! Qe5+ 20 Kh7 Qe4+! 21 Kg8 Qa8+! 22 f8Q Qd5+ =.
16 Qg7+ Kh4 (16...Kf4 17 Qc7+ +-) and then:
a) 17 f7? is premature due to the bad position of the queen: 17...Qb6+ 18 Kd5 Qb7+ and Black has a perpetual check, e.g. 19 Kxc5 Qc7+ 20 Kd5 Qd7+ 21 Ke5 Qb5+ (21...Qe7+? 22 Kf5! Qd7+ 23 Kg6! +-) 22 Kf6 Qc6+ =. b) 17 Qg2! Qb8 18 Qe4+ Kh3 19 f7 +-.

17 f7 Qf5+ (D)
18 Kd6?!
At this stage White could win quite easily: 18 Ke7!? Qe5+ (18...Qe4+ 19 Kf6 Qe5+ 20 Kg6 Qg5+ 21 Kh7 Qf5+ 22 Kh8 +-) 19 Kf8 h4 (19...c4 20 Qg6 Qh8+
21 Ke7 Qe5+ 22 Qe6 Qc7+ 23 Kf6 Qc5 24 Kg7 +-) 20 Qg6 h3 (or 20...Qh8+ 21
Ke7! Qe5+ 22 Kd7 +-) 21 Kg8 Qd5 22 Kh7 Qd7 23 Qf6+ Ke4 24 Kh8 h2 25 Qh4+ Kd3 26 f8Q +-. After the text-move Adorjan also won but it took much longer. In the previous two examples we have noticed that first one has to activate the king and then push the pawns forward. Usually this is true but no rule is without exception. It is worth noting that sometimes there are important pawn moves that have to come first: J.Timman - B.Larsen Buenos Aires 1980 1 h5! This makes the black g-pawn backward, and thus takes away possible spare tempi. Black can't profit from an outside passed pawn after ...g6 because his king isn't able to get into the white position.
1 Kf3? would be wrong since then Black could realize his extra pawn: 1...g6! 2
Kg3 Kf7 3 Kf3 (3 h5 g5! -+) 3...Kf6 4 Ke3 g5! 5 hxg5+ hxg5! 6 fxg5+ Kxg5! - + and Black wins by analogy to 10.01.
1...Kf7 2 Kf2 Kf6 3 Kf3! 1⁄2-1⁄2
Black can't make any progress: 3...g5 (3...Ke6 4 Ke3 Kd5 5 Kd3! = and he doesn't have a spare move with a pawn) 4 hxg6! Kxg6 5 Kg3! Kf6 (5...Kh5 6 Kh3! =) 6 Kh4! and White is fast enough to prevent a march of the black king to the centre: 6...Kg6 = (not 6...Ke6? 7 Kh5! Kd5 8 Kxh6! Kd4 9 Kg6! Ke4 10 Kg5! +-). Though the number of pawns is equal, the familiar procedure is also possible in the next example: M.Euwe Deutsche Schachzeitung, 1940 Such a pawn-structure can, for example, arise in the Exchange Spanish. Thus it is important to deal with it. Again the first step is to bring the king closer to the pawns and then one should advance on the kingside since the mobilization of the majority is the right way to exploit the quasi-extra pawn. Since both sides still have seven pawns there is only a little space for penetration, which demands a certain amount of precision.
1 Ke2 Ke7 2 Ke3 Ke6 3 f4 c5 4 c4 c6 5 a4 b5 6 b3!
White now has a kind of formation on the queenside against which Black can't create a passed pawn. 6 cxb5? cxb5! = would of course give up the whole advantage and the position would be drawn.
6...f6 (D)
7 g4 7 a5? gives away the decisive spare tempo: a) Not 7...b4? 8 g4: a1) 8...h6 9 f5+ Ke5 10 h3 Kd6 11 Kf4 Kd7 12 e5 Ke7 13 exf6+ (13 e6 followed by Kg3-h4-h5-g6 also wins) 13...gxf6 14 h4 Kf7 15 g5!

14 gxh5 +- B) Majority vs Central Passed Pawn In Chapter 8 we got to know the strength of an outside passed pawn. It's similar with an outside majority, as the following examples will show: K.Müller - V.Lagudin Pula 1989 White places his king on the dream square d4, whereupon it becomes clear that the queenside majority far outweighs the weakened kingside pawn-structure.
1 Kc2 a5?
1...Kc7:

L.Winants - L.Riemersma Dordrecht 1988 It is a little bit surprising that White isn't able to win here: 1 b4!?

6...Kc6 7 Kc4 Kd6! 8 b5 axb5+! 9 Kxb5 Kc7! 10 Kc5 Kb7! =
Of course White would have won easily if the h-pawns had been g-pawns. C) Spread Majorities Usually a short majority is better than a longer one (especially a two versus one majority because after its mobilization there is either a protected passed pawn or no opposing pawn left). Levenfish, 1950 With his example, Levenfish wanted to demonstrate the strength of an outside passed pawn, which is to be created by ...b6, ...a6 and ...b5. However, the active white king just manages to neutralize this advantage. White though, as we see in the main line by Maizelis, has to act very precisely:
1...h5!?
1...b6 2 f5+ (2 h5 = Averbakh) 2...gxf5+ 3 gxf5+! Kf6 (3...Kd6 4 h5 a6 5 Kd4 b5

Not 2...Kf7? 3 fxg6+ Kxg6 4 g5! Kf7 5 Ke5 Ke7 6 Kf5 Kf7 7 a5 +-, since here the protected passed pawn is stronger than the outside majority. 3 gxf5+! Kf6 4 a5!

4 Kd5? Kxf5! 5 a5 (5 Kd6 Kg4 6 Kc7 Kxh4 7 Kxb7 a5! -+) and then:
a) 5...b5? 6 a6! Kg4 (for 6...b4 7 Kc4! Ke4 8 Kxb4 Kd5 9 Kb5 Kd6 10 Kc4 Kc6
11 Kd4! Kb6 12 Kd5! Kxa6 13 Kc6! =, see the main line) 7 Kc5! Kxh4 8 Kxb5!
Kg5 9 Kc6! =; see 3.07. b) 5...Kg4! 6 Kd6 b5! 7 Kc5 a6! -+.
4...b5 (D)
5 a6!! Essential precision, motivated by Bähr's Rule and the counterplay against the black a-pawn. Not 5 axb6? axb6! -+; nor 5 Kd5? a6! (5...Kxf5? 6 a6! =) 6 Ke4 b4! 7 Kd3 Kxf5
8 Kc4 Kg4 9 Kxb4 Kxh4! 10 Kc5 Kg5 11 Kb6 h4! -+.

8 Kxb4 Kd4 9 Kb5! Kd5 10 Kb4! Kc6 11 Kc4! Kb6 12 Kd5! Kxa6 13 Kc6!
The position would be won according to Bähr's Rule if Black could leave his a- pawn at a7. However, in order to get away from the edge of the board he has to move the a-pawn.
13...Ka5 14 Kc5! a6
14...Ka4 15 Kc4! Ka3 16 Kb5 =.
15 Kc4! Ka4 16 Kc5!
16 Kc3? Kb5! 17 Kb3 Kc5 -+.
16...Kb3 17 Kb6! Kc4 18 Kxa6 =
After one couldn't force a win in the previous example, now the 2-1 majority is successful despite the bad king position: A.Liebstein - Ju.Bolbochan Mar del Plata Zonal 1951 The winning plan falls into two phases.
1...a5 2 Kd3 Kg7 3 Kc2 Kf8 4 Kc3 Ke7 5 Kc2 Kd6 6 Kd3 Kc5
The first phase of the plan is completed while White couldn't do anything without weakening himself. Now though, the black king threatens to get to d4, which has to be prevented by White because further passive play isn't possible any more. 7 f4
7 Kc3 b4+ 8 Kb3 Kb5! 9 f4 a4+ 10 Kc2 Kc4 11 fxe5 Kd4! -+.
7...f6 8 Kc3
8 fxe5 fxe5! -+. Now White's outside passed pawn becomes a prey of the black king because the white king can't support it.
8...Kd6
After White has opened up an entry route, the black king now gets back to the kingside:
9 Kd2 Ke7 10 Kd3 Kf7 11 Kd2 Kg6 12 Ke3 Kh5 13 Kf3 b4 14 g4+ Kg6 15
fxe5 fxe5 16 Ke3 Kg5 17 Kd3 Kxg4 18 Kc4 Kf3 19 Kb5 Kxe4 20 Kxa5 Kd3
21 Kxb4 e4! 22 Kb5 e3 23 a4 e2 0-1
For a detailed explanation of the very important practical question of which majority is the 'better' one, we now deal with two further examples. Y.Hellwing - J.Nunn London Lloyds Bank 1990 In the first case Black has the majority on the short wing and thus is better off. Against precise defence this advantage is not sufficient to win because the white king is more active and his pawns on the queenside can't be so easily attacked.

Concerning the second position we could use an analysis by Dr Hübner that was published in CBM 41 with the title 'Abfall' (trash): M.Bier - A.Schwarz Leipzig 1879 The white king is more active than its black colleague and his majority is far advanced. But due to Black's 2-1 majority this shouldn't be enough: 1 a5?! 1 b5!? is the more natural move and would have caused problems for Black as well. 1...a5! (1...a6? 2 c6! bxc6 3 bxa6! +-; 1...Kd7? 2 Ke5 Ke7 3 a5 Kd7 4 Kf5 +-; 1...g5? 2 a5! +- see the game) and then: a) 2 Ke4 g6 (2...g5?! 3 b6 Kd7! 4 Kf5! Kc6! 5 Kg6! Kxc5! 6 Kxh6! Kxb6! 7 Kxg5!

takes it on the chin. 0-1 D) Even Distribution of Pawns Now we shall discuss positions where the pawns on both wings are distributed in an even but not completely symmetrical way. A.Miles - J.Klinger Biel 1986 Though White has the advantage of the more outside candidate on the a-file, Black is able to draw with precise play:
1...Ke6
1...b5 2 b3 Ke6 3 a4 c4! 4 axb5 cxb3! =.
2 Kd3 Kd5 3 b3 g5 4 Kc3 f5 5 Kd3 b5 6 g4 fxg4
6...f4 7 a4 Kc6 (7...bxa4 =) 8 Ke4 (8 axb5+ Kxb5! 9 Kc3 Kb6 10 Kc4 Kc6! =)
and now: a) After 8...Kb6? White is too fast: 9 axb5! Kxb5 10 Kf5! Kb4 11 Kxg5! Kxb3
12 Kf5 c4 13 g5! c3 14 g6! c2 15 g7! c1Q 16 g8Q+! Kb4 17 Qb8+ Ka3 18 Qxf4
+-. b) 8...bxa4 enables Black to launch a timely counter-attack: 9 bxa4! Kb6 10 Kd5 Ka5! =. c) 8...c4 9 axb5+! Kxb5! 10 bxc4+! Kxc4! 11 Kf5 Kd3 12 Kxg5 Ke3! =. 7 fxg4! (D)
7...Ke5?
This allows the creation of a winning outside passed pawn. Black should play
7...Kc6 8 Ke4 Kd6:
a) 9 Kf5? Kd5! 10 Kxg5 c4 11 bxc4+ bxc4! 12 Kf4 Kd4 13 Kf3 Kd3! 14 Kf2 (14 g5 c3! -+; Black immediately wins the white queen by ...Qf1+ and ...Qg1+)
14...c3! -+.
b) 9 a4 c4! 10 axb5! cxb3! 11 Kd3! =. 8 a4! c4+
8...bxa4 9 bxa4! Kd5 10 Kc3 c4 11 a5 +-.
9 Kc3! 1-0
And finally a very difficult example from grandmaster practice: R.Vaganian - Z.Vranesić Toronto 1990 The problems arise from the great number of possibilities; often it is not clear whether the black king should be activated or not:
1 Ke4

back Instructive example The majority can't be mobilized so easily because the f-candidate lacks support from its fellow pawns, but one can break the black blockade by a typical pawn sacrifice:

back H.Steiner - O.Bernstein Groningen 1946 White has a great advantage since the black king has no way to penetrate if he doesn't play ...a5. Against the best defence a difficult queen ending will arise, in which White will have excellent winning chances, but we have not been able to prove a win.

Black has the more active king and a space advantage on both wings, and this should be sufficient for a win. He has to proceed very accurately though.

back 11: Fight for Tempi and Manoeuvres In contrast to Chapter 10, passed pawns now play a minor role. The main question is whether the kings are able to penetrate and how one should use spare tempi or how the pawn-structure should be changed. A) Typical Manoeuvres with an Even Distribution of Pawns B) "Don't Touch Me!" C) King-March and Fight for Tempi A) Typical Manoeuvres with an Even Distribution of Pawns The first example shows the procedure by which the more passive side can draw if he is able to prevent the opponent's king from getting into his position: The white pawns are one rank further up the board, and so they are usually faster when a race is concerned. But keeping the opposition is all it takes for Black to draw:
1 Ke4!?

White just doesn't manage to win the opposition. 2...bxa5? 3 bxa5! Kd6 4 Kd4! Kc6 5 Ke5! Kb5 6 Kf6! Kxa5 7 Kxg6 Kb4 8 h5 +-; 2...Kd6? 3 axb6! Kc6 4 h5 +-.
3 g5 h5! 4 Kd4! Kd6! 5 Ke4! Ke6! =
Often a defence based on the opposition can be broken by a single spare tempo: Due to g2-g3 Black can't defend the key squares of the a-pawn:
1 Kc4
1 g3 also wins at once, but in this line one has to calculate the race precisely:
1...Ke6 (1...Kc6 2 Kc4! +-) 2 Kc5 Kf5 3 Kb5 Kg4 4 Kxa5! Kxg3 5 Kb4 and
White wins.
1 Ke4?? allows the black king to penetrate on the queenside: 1...Kc5! -+.
1...Kc6 2 g3!
With the help of the spare tempo, White wins the opposition and conquers the key squares of the a-pawn.
2...Kb6 3 Kd5! +-
Sometimes one can also gain a spare tempo by other means: G.Kamsky - V.Tukmakov Reykjavik Open 1990 Though White's queenside majority is unable to create a passed pawn, it can provide the decisive spare tempo.
1 b3 Kf6 2 Kf4 Kg6 3 c5!?
3 b5 axb5 4 c5! also wins (but not 4 cxb5? b6! 5 Ke5 Kg5! and Black can draw).
3 Ke4?! Kg5 4 Kf3! Kf6 5 c5 Kg5!? (5...Kg6 6 Kf4 Kf6 7 b5! axb5 8 b4! +-) 6
Kg3! (6 b5? gives away the opportunity to gain a spare tempo: 6...axb5! 7 b4 Kg6! 8 Kf4 Kf6! = and now it's White to move in a position of reciprocal zugzwang) 6...Kg6 7 Kf4! (7 Kh4?! Kf6 8 Kh5 Kg7 9 b5? axb5! 10 b4 Kh7! 11 g5 hxg5! 12 Kxg5! Kg7 =) 7...Kf6 8 b5! axb5 9 b4! +-.
3...Kf6 4 b5!
Gaining a tempo; the further-advanced of the doubled pawns is sacrificed in order to create a zugzwang with the back pawn that is fatal for Black.
4...axb5 5 b4! Ke6 6 Ke4! Kf6 7 Kd5! 1-0
There could have followed 7...Kg5 (7...Ke7 8 c6 bxc6+ 9 Kxc6! +-) 8 Kd6! Kxg4 9 Kc7! h5 10 Kxb7! and White wins because the c-pawn queens with check. The following two practical examples are not at all easy: L.Sandler - P.Leko Sydney 1992 It soon becomes obvious that Black is better. His king is more active (because he is to move) and all of his pawns have the option of a possible double step while White has already played a3 and f3. So if necessary, a fight for tempi would be in Black's favour. Despite these advantages Black isn't able to win against the best defence.
1...Ke5!?
By 1...Kd5 Black achieves nothing: 2 Kf4!? Kc4 3 Ke5 Kb3 4 Kf6 b5 5 Kxf7 is a draw. 2 a4!? White should immediately try to build a defensive position by a4 and b3 in order then to be able to oscillate with his king on the 3rd rank. The move a4 is necessary because otherwise Black could undermine the b3-pawn by ...b5 and ...a5-a4. The game proceeded instead 2 f4+?! Kd5 (D) and now: a) Sandler made a decisive error, losing as follows: 3 b3? b5 4 Kd3 a5 5 h3 h6 6 Ke3 a4 7 bxa4 (7 Kd3 axb3 8 Kc3 Ke4 9 Kxb3 Kxf4 10 Kb4 f5 11 Kxb5 Kg3 also wins for Black; the f-pawn queens with check) 7...bxa4! 8 Kd3 f5! -+ 0-1. b) 3 a4!! b6 (after 3...Kc4 White's counter-attack is fast enough: 4 Ke4! Kb3 5 Ke5 =) 4 Kd3 a6 5 b3 b5 (5...f5 6 b4 =) 6 axb5! axb5 7 Kc3 Kc5 (7...Ke4 8 Kb4! =) 8 f5 h5 (8...f6 9 Kd3! h5 10 Ke4? {10 h4! =} 10...h4! 11 h3 b4! 12 Ke3 Kd5!

2...a5 3 h3 h6 4 f4+ Kd5 5 Kd3 f5 6 b3
This protects the key square c4, while the white king can defend d4 and e4 by oscillating between d3 and e3: 6...b6 7 h4 h5 8 Ke3! Kc5 9 Kd3! Kb4 10 Kc2!? (10 Kd4?! Kxb3!? 11 Ke5 Kxa4!? 12 Kxf5 b5 =+) 10...b5 11 axb5! Kxb5 12 Kd3 Kb4 13 Kc2! =. The next game is of fundamental significance and demands special attention: R.Hegde - E.Vasiukov Coimbatore 1987 One usual winning plan for the more active king is the exchange of all pawns on one wing in order to use the existing space or time advantage on the other wing. However, in the present example White can avoid the exchange of the b2-pawn with the help of a nice stalemate trick:
1...b5 2 g4+
2 Ke3 Ke5 (2...Kg4 3 Kf2! f5 4 Kg2! =) 3 g4 leads to the game.
2...Ke5
2...Kg5 3 Kg3! f5 4 gxf5! Kxf5 =. The strategy of exchanging all the kingside
pawns doesn't help him either since now Black can no longer penetrate on the queenside.
3 Ke3! Kd5 4 Kd3!?
4 Kf4?! is very risky from a practical point of view: 4...Kc4 5 Kf5! Kb3 6 Kxf6!

10 bxa3? Kxa3! -+; 10 g5? fxg5! -+. 1⁄2-1⁄2 Due to 10...axb2 11 g5 fxg5! stalemate. It isn't obvious that the same stalemate trick is again the only way to save the game in the following example: Variation from C.D.Meyer - H.Dutschak Bundesliga 1996 Although Black's queenside pawn-structure is weakened, White cannot exploit this fact nor can he use his space advantage. No matter how White proceeds on the kingside, Black always has an adequate answer. 1 h5 a) 1 f5 gxf5! 2 gxf5! h5! 3 a5 bxa5! 4 bxa5! Kd7 =. b) 1 g5 fxg5!

1...gxh5! 2 gxh5! f5! 3 a5 bxa5! 4 bxa5! Kb8!
This leads to the familiar (11.05) stalemate finish.
4...Kc8? loses a decisive tempo: 5 Kc4 Kb8 6 Kd5 Ka7 7 Ke5 Ka6 8 Kxf5!
Kxa5 9 Ke6 +- and White wins in the end by Qa8+ and Qb8+.
5 Kb6 Ka8! 6 a6 Kb8! 7 axb7 stalemate.
B) "Don't Touch Me!" This special form of a fight for tempi is characterized by two pawns of different colour standing next to each other. First horizontal: Y.Averbakh Both kings have to keep their distance from the 'don't touch me' pawns (a6, b6). If either king moves next to them he gets into a fatal zugzwang.
1 Kb4!
1 Kb5? Ka7! -+.
1...Kb8!
1...Ka7? 2 Kb5! +-.
2 Kc4 Ka8! 3 Kb4! =
3 Kd5? Ka7! 4 Ke5 b5! -+.
For such positions it's worthwhile knowing the following rule. We distinguish between two cases: 1) No or same number of spare tempi: one shouldn't move first to a 'don't touch me' square (b5 or a7 in 11.07) but one has to keep a short distance away. 2) Different number of spare moves: one should move as soon as possible to a 'don't touch me' square. It follows that positions of the first type are usually drawn while in the second case there is usually a decisive result. Three examples should illustrate that: After Maizelis Both sides have the same number of tempi with their pawns; thus we have the first case:
1 Kg3 Kg7 2 Kh3
2 Kf3?! Kg6 3 Kf4! a5 4 b3! d6 5 c4 is a draw.
2...Kf7 3 Kg3!
To move closer would be fatal: 3 Kh4? Kg6! 4 c4 (4 c3 a6 5 b3 d6 6 b4 d5! -+)
4...a5! 5 b3 d6! -+.
3...Kg7! =

Kg8 11 Kg6! a3 12 bxa3! d6 13 c6 +-. With black pawns at b7 and c7 the spare moves would have been equal as well. In that case too neither side would have been able to move next to the pawns. The next case is different: The two sides have a different number of spare tempi. Therefore the king should step on the 'don't touch me' square as soon as possible:
1 Kd4
After 1 Kc3? Black uses the rule and turns the tables: 1...Kc6 2 Kd4 g5!! (first h3 has to be fixed; an immediate 2...a5? doesn't work: 3 h4 a4 4 g4 a3 5 f4 h6 6 h5 f6 7 f5! +-) 3 f3 (3 g3 a5! 4 g4 a4! 5 a3 f6 6 f3 h6! -+) 3...a5 4 g3 a4 5 a3 h5
6 h4 gxh4 7 gxh4 f6! 8 f4 f5! 9 Ke5 Kxc5! 10 Kxf5 d4! 11 Ke4 Kc4! -+. Black
either queens with check or wins the white queen by ...Qe1+ and ...Qf1+.
1...Kc6 2 h4
2 f4 +-.
2...g6
2...h5 3 a3 a5 4 a4! g6 (4...f6 5 f3! g5 6 g3! +-) 5 f3! f6 6 f4 f5 7 g3! +-.
3 g3 f5 4 a3! a5 5 a4! f4 6 g4 h6 7 f3! g5 8 h5! +-
Because of its great popularity we have to include the following example: Sveda - Sika Brno 1929 White to move would win: 1 Kf3! (1 h4? Ke6! 2 Kf2! =; 1 Kf2?? Ke5 2 Kf3 a5! -+) 1...Ke5 (now White has to get rid of the disadvantage of having already played h3) 2 h4! a5 3 h5! a4 4 h6! b6 5 b4! +-. In the game it was Black's move: 1...Ke5 2 Kf3 a5! (Black plays on the wing where he has a disadvantage in terms of spare tempi) 3 b3 b5 4 a3 a4 5 bxa4 bxa4! 6 h4 h5! 0-1. 'Don't touch me' pawns that block each other are known to us from Chapter 2. Here the rule is applied as well: L.Polugaevsky - K.Grigorian USSR Ch (Leningrad) 1971 White uses his right to move to get Black into zugzwang:
1 Kg4! Kc5
1...g6 2 h5! gxh5+ 3 Kxh5 +-; 1...Kb5 2 Kf5! a4 3 bxa4+ Kxa4 4 Kxe5! Kxa3 5
Kd6 +-.
2 Kf5!
2 h5? b5! 3 Kf5 b4! 4 axb4+ Kxb4! 5 Kxe5! Kxb3! =.
2...Kd4
Now the kings can't move any longer without giving up their respective e- pawns. By accurate play White makes sure it is Black who first runs out of moves: 3 h5! b5
3...Kc3 4 Kxe5! Kxb3 5 Kd5 b5 6 e5! b4 7 axb4! a4 8 e6 a3 9 e7! a2 10 e8Q!

4...axb4 5 axb4! Kc4 6 Kxe5! Kxb4 7 Kd4 Ka5 8 Kc5! b4 9 Kc4! is winning for
White. 5 g4! Kc4 6 Kxe5! Kb3 7 Kd4! Kxa3 8 Kc3! Ka2 9 Kc2! 1-0 C) King-March and Fight for Tempi Now that we have familiarized ourselves with the basic techniques of manoeuvres and the fight for tempi, we are ready to discuss long king-marches into the opponent's position. H.Behrens - R.Storm Germany 1982 The first example looks relatively simple because with Kg3-f4-e5 White has a clear route and appears to have enough spare tempi to achieve his aim:
1 Kg3!? Kf6 2 Kf4!? h6?
2...g6? 3 g4! (3 e4? h6 =) 3...fxg4 (3...h6 4 g5+! +-) 4 fxg4! and now:
a) 4...a4 5 e4! (5 g5+? Ke7! 6 e4 dxe4! 7 Kxe4 Kd6! 8 a3 Kd7! 9 Ke5 Ke7! =)
5...dxe4 6 Kxe4!:
a1) 6...g5 7 h5!? (7 hxg5+?! Kxg5 8 Ke5! Kxg4 9 Kxe6! h5 10 d5! h4 11 d6! h3 12 d7! h2 13 d8Q! h1Q 14 Qd4+ Kg3 15 Qxa4 +/-) 7...Kf7 8 Ke5 Ke7 9 d5 exd5 10 Kxd5! Kd7 11 Ke5 Ke7 12 Kf5 +-. a2) 6...a3 7 d5 +-. a3) 6...Kf7 7 Ke5 Ke7 8 h5 (after 8 a3? Black can close the position: 8...h6! 9 h5 g5! =) 8...gxh5 9 gxh5! a3 10 d5 exd5 11 Kxd5! Kd7 12 h6! (12 Ke5?! Ke7 13 h6 Kd7 14 Kf6? Kd6! 15 Kg7 Ke7 is drawn because White can't leave the corner) 12...Kc7 13 Ke6! +- and White captures the b6-pawn. b) 4...e5+ 5 dxe5+! Ke6 6 e4 (6 Kg5?? Kxe5! 7 Kh6 Ke4! 8 Kxh7 Kxe3! 9 Kxg6 d4! 10 h5 d3! 11 h6 d2! 12 h7 d1Q! 13 h8Q Qxg4+! 14 Kf7 -/+) 6...d4 7 g5! a4 8 a3! Ke7 9 Kf3! Ke6 10 Ke2! Kxe5 11 Kd3! +- gets Black in a 'don't touch me' zugzwang set-up. However, even in this seemingly clear-cut case, there is a saving resource for Black: 2...a4!. This deprives White of at least one of his spare tempi and ensures that White's a- and b-pawns will be targets in lines where the centre opens up. Since Black also avoids making a concession on the kingside, White doesn't have a way to seal the kingside and centre in a way that would enable him to march his king over to the queenside and capture Black's a-pawn. For instance, 3 g4 h6 4 g5+ hxg5+! 5 hxg5+! Ke7 leaves Black with the possibility of bringing the king to g6 and h5 if the white king backtracks, while after 3 e4 dxe4 4 fxe4 g6! or 3 a3 g6! 4 e4 (4 g4 fxg4! 5 fxg4 h6! makes sure enough lines stay open; e.g., 6 g5+ hxg5+ 7 hxg5+ Kf7! 8 Kf3 e5!? =) 4...dxe4 5 fxe4! h6!, Black's potential passed pawn on the kingside restricts the white king's movements. After the move played in the game, White's plan proceeded unhindered: 3 h5! Kf7 4 Ke5 Ke7 5 e4 dxe4 6 fxe4! fxe4 7 Kxe4 Kf6 8 Kf4 a4 9 a3 Kf7 10 Ke5 Ke7 11 d5 exd5 12 Kxd5! Kd7 13 g3 Kc7 14 Ke6! Kc8 15 Kf7 1-0 The route isn't always indicated so clearly: Hansen - A.Nimzowitsch Randers 1925 It seems as if Black is about to lose because White is threatening to create an outside passed pawn on the a-file by c3. But Aron Nimzowitsch managed to turn the tables by penetrating on the queenside with his king:
1...Kc7!!
After 1...c5? White can create an outside passed pawn: 2 dxc5+! (2 c4? Kc6! =)
2...Kxc5 3 c3! +-.
2 c3 Other moves don't help either: a) 2 c4 Kb6 3 cxd5 cxd5! 4 Kc2 Ka5 (4...Kb5? 5 Kb3! Ka5! 6 a4 bxa3! 7 Kxa3! =) 5 Kb2 Ka4! 6 Kc2 Ka3! 7 Kb1 b3! 8 Ka1 Kb4 -+. b) 2 a3 bxa3! 3 Kc3 Kb6 (3...c5 also wins but after 4 dxc5 Kc6 5 Kb3 Kxc5 6 Kxa3 d4 7 Kb3 Kd5! 8 Kb4 one has to find the idea 8...d3!! 9 cxd3 Kd4! -+) 4 Kb3 Kb5 5 c3 c5 6 dxc5 Kxc5! 7 Kxa3 Kc4 8 Kb2 d4 -+.
2...Kb6! 3 cxb4 Kb5! 4 Kc3 Ka4! 0-1
Hansen resigned because of 5 Kc2 (5 b5 cxb5! 6 Kb2 Kb4 -+) 5...Kxb4! 6 Kd3 Ka3 7 Kc3 Kxa2! 8 Kb4 Kb2! 9 Kc5 Kc3 -+. The next game, which was analysed in detail by Magerramov in Informator 44, shows typical resources for the attack and the defence: E.Magerramov - S.Makarychev Pavlodar 1987 White has to continue very accurately so that his route on the kingside isn't plugged. Furthermore the queenside isn't yet closed. 1 a4!
1 Kc4? b5+! 2 Kd3 Kd6 3 Ke3 Ke7! 4 Kf2 (4 Kf3 Kf7! 5 Kg4 g5 6 fxg6+ Kxg6!

manages to reach the reciprocal zugzwang with White to play: 6...Kxg6? 7 Kg4! a6 8 h3! h5+ 9 Kf3! f5 10 exf5+ Kxf5 11 Ke3 +-) 7 Kg4 Kxg6! 8 h3 a6 9 Kf3! Kg5 10 g4 Kg6! =. After 1 g4? (the move played in the game itself) Black can block the way to the kingside: a) 1...a6 2 Kc4 (after 2 a4 h5! 3 h3 h4 = White cannot close the queenside, nor does he have enough reserve tempi to penetrate there himself) 2...h5! (2...Kd6? 3 a4 Kc6 4 b5+ axb5+ 5 axb5+! Kd6 6 h3 Kc7 7 Kd5 Kd7 8 h4 +-) 3 h3 h4 4 a4 a5 =. b) The erroneous 1...b5? was played in the game: 2 Kd3 Kd6 (2...h5 is now not enough, as Black has closed the queenside himself: 3 Ke3 hxg4 4 Kf2 Kd6 5 Kg3 Ke7 6 Kxg4 Kf8 7 Kh5 Kf7 8 h3! a6 9 h4! Kf8 10 Kg6! Kg8 11 h5! +-) 3 Ke3 Ke7 4 Kf3 (D). Now Black can continue: b1) 4...Kf7 5 Kg3! g5 6 fxg6+! Kg7 (6...Kxg6 7 Kh4! a6 8 h3! Kg7 9 Kh5! Kh7 10 h4! Kg7 11 g5! hxg5 12 hxg5!

Afterwards White exchanges pawns in a favourable way and wins due to his more active king.

back J.Fedorowicz - M.Chandler London Lloyds Bank 1987 The black king is so active that the weakened black pawns on the queenside are by far outweighed.

back K.Müller - N.Narings Dutch Junior Ch (Arnhem) 1988 White's winning plan is first to get the king to f6, then to exchange the kingside by g4, f5 and again Kf6 and e6 so as then to use the more active king position. Therefore Black has to take care that his queenside pawn-structure doesn't become too weak. This can only be managed by an exchange at b4.

The game in fact continued 1...a5? 2 bxa5 bxa5 3 Kg5 Ke7 4 g3 Kf8, when White could exchange the kingside pawns and win: 5 Kf6 Ke8 6 g4 Kf8 (6...c4 7 f5 exf5 8 gxf5! gxf5 9 Kxf5 Ke7 10 Kf4 Kd7 11 Ke3 Ke6 12 Ke4! +-) 7 f5 exf5 8 gxf5! gxf5 9 Kxf5 Ke7 10 c4 Kd7 11 Kf6! Ke8 12 e6! Kf8 13 Ke5 +- 1-0.
1...c4? can be cut off by b5 and then be captured by the white king. In this line
White can even allow the kingside to be closed once he has captured the c4- pawn since he has the option c3-c4-c5xb6 with a new route on the queenside.

back H.Neustadtl - Porges Since the black king has to prevent the penetration of the white king via the d4- square, Black can be forced into zugzwang by a triangulation and compelled to move the h-pawn.

But what exactly are corresponding squares? In an ideal case they are a system of exactly corresponding squares on which the kings are in reciprocal zugzwang (that means, for example, if the white king moves to a square of the system the black king has to move to the corresponding square in order to draw and White, in order to win, has to move in such a way that the black king can't move to the corresponding square - because he is already on it or because he can't fly). However, not all examples that can be analysed according to the theory of corresponding squares fit this ideal picture, since reserve pawn moves and possible counter-attacks by the defending king can disrupt the pattern. We will include the resulting "system-transient corresponding squares" (Zinar) into the numbering scheme and if necessary we will assign several numbers to a single square. Our chapter on corresponding squares is intended for the practical player even though there are a lot of studies. Our stress is therefore on the following questions: How does one recognize a position of corresponding squares? How are the corresponding squares determined? How does the play proceed in a system of corresponding squares? If you would like a more detailed and rather theoretical approach to the theory of corresponding squares, we recommend an essay by the composer of studies, Zinar, in the last chapter of Averbakh's book (there he proposes a distinction between 11 special systems and explains what one has to do in each case). A) Corresponding Squares in Former Examples B) Bishop's Pawn and Rook's Pawn vs Rook's Pawn C) Complicated Cases A) Corresponding Squares in Previous Examples In the previous chapters we have already analysed positions in which the knowledge of corresponding squares helped a lot to understand the position better. We shall again look at some of these examples in order to explain or train the determination of corresponding squares with the help of positions with which we are already familiar. N.Grigoriev Izvestia, 1921 Naturally our main focus in this chapter is on the manoeuvres of the kings. We therefore always start with the determination of the key squares since they are decisive for the determination of the corresponding squares. Key squares are e2, f2 and b3, a3 (marked by boxes). If, like here, not all key squares are next to each other, their shortest connection (the 'shortest way') is significant. The shortest way from b3 to e2 for White leads across a2-b1-c1-d1, while Black defends himself via b4-c5-d4-e3. Since both sides have only one shortest way at their disposal here the squares of the shortest way are at the same time corresponding squares which we number from 1 to 4. Then we number the rest of the squares that are directly next to the key squares. The square e1 gets a 5 (note that corresponding squares which are occupied by pieces are indicated below the diagram to avoid making the diagrams too messy!). Due to the threat either to move to one of the key squares or to 4, f3=5 is the corresponding square (this protects the key squares and is next to the 4). If the white king is at f1 then the black king has to move to e3. Nevertheless this square doesn't receive a number because after 1...Ke3? 2 Kf1?? White even loses due to the counter- attack 2...Kd2!. Because of the edge of the board only the square a1=6 remains for king manoeuvres. It corresponds to the b5-square (in order to go to 1 or 2 if necessary). Therefore, if Black is to move, he can only secure the draw if he keeps all corresponding squares. This is only possible by playing 1...Kf3! 2 Kd1 Ke3! 3 Kc1 Kd4! 4 Kb1 Kc5! 5 Ka1 Kb5! 6 Ka2 Kb4! =. The drawing of the corresponding squares in the next example immediately makes the win visible (what a pity that during the game you are not allowed to draw on the board...): N.Grigoriev K novoi armii, 1920 Here the key squares are d4, e2 and e3. The square d2=1 corresponds with f3=1, because Black can't leave the square of the d-pawn. c3=2 is adjacent to d4 and 1, which is only fulfilled by e3=2. The squares on the first rank don't get numbers because a counter-attack against the d-pawn would be possible. If we look at the other squares then White threatens to move from c2=3 to 1 or 2. These threats can only be answered by Black at f4=3. From b2 and b3 White threatens to move either to 2 or 3. Black only has one square from which he can move to 2 or 3, namely f3=1. Thus we can also assign a 1 to b2 and b3. It follows that White has more corresponding squares, and this secures the win. As we already know, the easiest route to success is 1 Kc2 Kf4 2 Kb3 Kf3 3 Kb2 Kf4 4 Kc2! Kf3 5 Kd2! Kf4 6 Ke2! +-. The next two positions show that our knowledge of the different forms of opposition is based on corresponding squares: Key squares are f6, f7 and f8. With three or more key squares that are next to each other first you always have to number the adjacent squares that are parallel. Thus e6, e7, e8 = 1, 2, 3 correspond to g6, g7, g8 = 1, 2, 3 with Black. The squares d6, d7, d8 or h6, h7, h8 with Black get the numbers 4, 5 and 6. Afterwards the numbers repeat each other until a counter-attack is possible, here even to the edge of the board. f7 and f8 don't get numbers since the f6-square isn't available to Black. If White stays on the fifth rank Black only has to parry the white threat to move to 1 or 4, thus to stay at 2 or 5. Since this is always possible, the squares of the fifth rank don't get numbers. White doesn't have a surplus of corresponding squares, because of which Black draws if he takes the corresponding square to b6 by 1...Kh6!. The next example shows that even big systems of corresponding squares can arise: After Van Nyevelt Superiorité, 1792 Black mustn't leave the square of the a-pawn. Key squares are c4, d4 and e4-e7, as well as d7-a7 if Black gives up the defence of e8. For a better overview we start the numbering along the key squares on the e-file: White f4-f7=1-4=d4-d7 with Black. Then we number g4-g7=5-8=e4-e7 (defence on the key squares). A defence along the c-file isn't possible because there is no access to the c4-square. The 2, 6 combination on the third rank is due to the key squares c4-e4. On the second rank there are no corresponding squares since Black can oscillate on 3 and 7 or 1 and 5 until White moves to the third rank. The squares 3a, 7a result from the key squares on the seventh rank. We have given them an 'a' because with a white king on f8 or h8 Black can either defend by ...Kd6 or by ...Kd8 (easier). But if the white king is on f6 or h6 (no a-numbers!) only ...Kd6 is correct. The numbers 9-11 result from the key squares c7-a7. a5 is an additional corresponding square since Ka7 or Kb7 leads to a stalemate. In this connection a7 and b7 are therefore inferior key squares.
1...Kd5! =
Even though the diagram looks to be unclear, Black always draws by taking the appropriate form of opposition. After these introductory examples our first question can be largely answered: one recognizes the issue of corresponding squares by the fact that there are not many pawn moves still possible and that there are at least two squares that correspond to each other. If you have detected two corresponding squares it's usually worth looking for more. B) Bishop's Pawn and Rook's Pawn vs Rook's Pawn With the help of this important pawn formation we will examine how the possibility of further pawn moves affects a system of corresponding squares. Our starting point is a position that is familiar from Chapter 5 (5.10 = 12.08). In order to understand its system of corresponding squares it is necessary to deal with positions in which the h-pawn is far-advanced. Due to the dangers of a possible stalemate, the f-pawn shouldn't be pushed forward too early, and because of this the analysis of corresponding squares makes sense. We start with the pawn at h3: C.Rösch - V.Mast (colours changed) Lingen 1995 This position is drawn, whoever is to move. Key squares are e3-e1 plus f3 and corresponding squares are d3-d1=1-3=f3-f1. There are no further corresponding squares because one can defend two key squares that are next to each other (e3, f3) by simple oscillation. In that way it's not important that White to move loses the vertical opposition. It follows that the h-pawn shouldn't be pushed to h3 too early.

Now to a pawn at h4: A.Khalifman - B.Gulko (colours changed) Erevan 1996 Obviously the key squares are e3, f3 and g2, h2. As we know from 12.05, the d3-square plays a special role (with kings at d3 and f3, ...h3! wins). We haven't continued our numbering on the d-file as White doesn't have to take the opposition there but can also counter-attack via f3. If the kings fight for the third rank on the queenside then White can only save himself by taking the (distant) opposition, provided he is more than one file ahead in the race to the kingside.

Notice also that the position with wKf3 vs bKg5 is a reciprocal zugzwang. ◼ Position 12.06 actually occurred in Vaganian-Sunye, Rio de Janeiro Interzonal 1979 and Boey-Hamann, Skopje Olympiad 1972. With a pawn at h5 the situation is as follows (the position corresponds to a study by Maizelis from 1955): H.Ree - Z.Ribli (colours and wings changed) Amsterdam 1973 The numbering is explained by the black option for a transition into 12.06 by ...h4. Since there only the opposition draws, one has to avoid it here. Thus White is in zugzwang and loses:
1 Kf2 Ke4 2 Ke2 h4! 3 Kf2 Kd3! 4 Kf3 h3! 5 Kf2 Kd2! 6 Kf3 Ke1! 7 Ke3
Kf1! 8 Kf3 Kg1! 9 Kg3 f4+! 0-1 If Black is to move, he can't make any progress since White has the 'anti- opposition':
1...Ke4 2 Kf2! Kf4 3 Ke2! Kg4 4 Kf2! Kh4 5 Kf1
5 Kg1? Kh3! 6 Kh1 Kg4! 7 Kg2 h4 -+ (12.06).
5...Kh3 6 Kg1! f4 7 Kh1! Kg4 8 Kg2! h4 9 Kf2! =
As a crowning finale we now discuss the situation with a pawn at h6 in more detail: R.Vaganian - J.Sunye Neto Rio de Janeiro Interzonal 1979 From 5.10 and 12.05-12.07 we know that White has to take the opposition on the second rank after the h6-pawn has moved to h4. Since this takes another two moves (an even number), White also now has to get the opposition on the second rank. It follows e4-g4=1-3=e2-g2. After ...Kh4 either the passive Kg1 or Kf3 (or Kf4), with a counter-attack against the f-pawn, is possible. Also after ...Kg4 White still has a trump in the threat of a counter-attack after Ke3. It follows that the square g5=5 corresponds with the squares f3, e2 and f1:
1 Ke2!! =
The obvious 1 Kg3?, as played in the game, fails to 1...h5! 2 Kf3 h4! -+ (12.06). With Black to move, the position is evidently a draw:
1...h5
1...Kh4?! 2 Kf4! =.
2 Kg3
2 Ke3 Kg4 3 Kf2! = (12.07).
2...Kf6 3 Kf4 Ke6 4 Ke3
4 Kg5? Ke5! 5 Kxh5 f4 -+.
4...Ke5 5 Kf3
5 Kd3 Kf4 6 Ke2! =.
5...h4 6 Ke3! = (12.06)
C) Complicated Cases Now that we have focused on the determination of corresponding squares, we would now like to look at some studies that deal with the issue of manoeuvres. Em.Lasker & G.Reichhelm Chicago Tribune, 1901 Key squares are b5, g5 and h5. The shortest way for White is c4-d3-(e2/e3)- (f2/f3)-g3-h4. On the black side only b6-c7-(d7/d8)-(e7/e8)-(f7/f6)-g6 isn't longer. The drawn lines indicate that the squares e1-e3 correspond to the squares d7-d8 (and also f2/f3 correspond to e7/e8 and g3 corresponds to f6/f7). On the kingside Black has a surplus of corresponding squares because of which we there only number h4=6=g6 (once the black king is on the kingside he also has the option of counterplay against the white f-pawn, so White can't reverse his tracks once he has gone to the kingside). For a determination of a system of corresponding squares on the queenside therefore only the distance to the key squares on the kingside is of interest. In other words: squares on the d-file for White have to correspond with squares on the c-file for Black. Thus: c4=1=b6, d3=2=c7, c3=3=b7, d2=4=c8, c2=5=b8. The remaining squares on the b-file and on the first rank for White don't create any new threats and can therefore be assigned numbers that we have already used. The squares on the b-file will be assigned an additional 'a' because Black is able to defend himself accordingly on the c-file as well as on the a-file. We also add a7=2a and a8=4a for Black. a1-a3 will not be numbered since they correspond with b7 as well as with b8. How does play now proceed in the determined system? The defender (Black) always has to be on the corresponding square. If this is, as in this case, not possible, the opponent's threat (here to occupy b1=2 or b2=4) has to be parried. Black to move manages this by either 1...Kb7 or 1...Kb8. The attacker (White) also has to occupy the corresponding square in order to win or he has to move in such a way that the defender isn't able to get to the corresponding square. Thereby the attacker should try to get closer to the key squares and at any rate he shouldn't move away from them. If White is to move, he therefore moves to a corresponding square of a7:
1 Kb1!
1 Kb2? Ka8!! =; 1 Ka2? Kb7 2 Kb3 Kc7 3 Kc3 Kb7! 4 Kd3 Kc7! 5 Ke2 Kd7 6

Black would need wings to reach the corresponding square, b8!
4...Kc8 5 Kd2! Kd7 6 Kc3! Kc7 7 Kd3! Kb6 8 Ke3 +-
White penetrates on the kingside. Locock British Chess Magazine, 1892 In addition to the obvious key square f4 with the pair of corresponding squares e3=1=g5 we have a second pair d4=2=f6 because of White's threat to play e5. There are no further key squares on the queenside because of the possible counter-attack against e4. Connecting squares are d3=3=g6. c4, c3, c2, d2 and e2 (=4-8) correspond to f7, g7, h7, h6 and h5. The remaining corresponding squares accordingly will be numbered with already used numbers. Due to the aforementioned counter-attack there are no clear corresponding squares on the a- file and if White moves to the f-file Black only has to oscillate between g6 and h6, which again isn't clear-cut. If Black is to play, he draws by 1...Kg7 or
1...Kh7 while if it is White's move, he wins as follows:
1 Kb1!
1 Kb2? Kh8!! 2 Kb3 Kg8! 3 Kc3 Kg7! 4 Kd4 Kf6! =; 1 Ka2? Kg7 2 Kb3 Kg6 =
(2...Kf6? 3 Kc2! +-).
1...Kg7 2 Kc1! Kg6 3 Kd1! Kg5 4 Kc2!
White exploits the fact that Black can't move to h7. After 4 Ke1?! Kg6 White has to return.

Black had to leave g7 unwatched. 6 Ke2?! Kh6 again doesn't help White.

10 exd6! Kf6 11 Ke4! Kg5 12 Ke5! Kg6 13 Kf4! +- ◼ Of course d6 and d7 are also key squares because of which the pairs of corresponding squares c7-e7 and c8-e8 arise. White can also use them by 1 Kb2? Kh8!! 2 Kb3 Kg8! 3 Kb4 Kf8! 4 Kb5. It just doesn't do him any good. W.Bähr, 1934 Key squares are c6, d6 and e7-g7. That leads to the pairs of corresponding squares f6=1=f8, e5=2=e7 and d5=3=d7. Behind them f5=4=e8 is the connecting square to 1,2, and e4=5=d8 makes it possible to move to 2-4. With the other squares one has to watch out for a few peculiarities. If Black has to defend on the first two ranks then the numbering can be extended (as in the diagram). However, there is a possibility of a counterattack, so Black wins with kings at d2 and d6 or e2 and e6, whoever is to move.

◼ The following studies are closely related to the present one: Bähr 1936: wKc2,Pb4,g4,h5; bKe8,Pb5,f6,h6 (ECE 468), Ebersz 1935: wKb1,Pa3,g5,h6; bKf8,Pa4,f7,h7 (ECE 469), Ebersz 1935: wKe1,Pa4,g5,h6; bKe8,Pb6,f7,h7 (ECE 470) as well as Bähr 1934: wKd2,Pb4,c5,g5,h6; bKd8,Pb7,b5,f7,h7 (ECE 609). Portisch & Sarközy take these studies in order to discuss articles by Ebersz and Barath (Magyar Sakkelet 1931, April 1954) about the role of 'geometrical opposition' in the theory of corresponding squares (page 9ff, No. 27-31). The interested reader should try to find out in which of the positions given above opposition plays a role and in which it doesn't. M.Zinar, 1983 Earlier editions of this book featured the following commentary: "Key squares are f3-f5 and e6, except that Ke6 leads to nothing if Black is already at g4. It follows e5=e3=1=g4, but one has to be aware of the fact that the position after Ke3 Kg4 is even lost. Further we label d5=2=f6 (protects e6 and e5=1), d4=3=g5 and d3=4=h5. Now the adjacent squares on the c-file have to be examined. Since one must bear in mind the possibility of Black playing ...Kg4, they are labelled c4=c2=1a=g6 and c3=1b=h6. Due to the counter-attack there are no corresponding squares on the b-file and Black has several options for the squares on the first rank. 1 Kc2! Kh6 2 Kc3! Kg6 3 Kc4! Kg5 4 Kd4! Kh5 5 Kd5! (5 Ke3?? Kg4! -+) 5...Kg4 6 Ke5! Kh3 (6...Kg5 7 Ke6! +-) 7 Kf4! Kg2 8 Ke3! +-." However, it turns out that Black also has the idea of a counterattack against White's queenside pawns, so the correspondence breaks down and the position is a draw. For instance, 1 Kc2 Kf6 2 Kd3 Ke5 3 Ke3! Kd5! 4 Kf4 (4 Kxf3 Kc4 5 Kf4 Kxb5 6 Kxf5 Kxc6! =) 4...Kc4 5 Kxf5 Kd3! 6 Ke6 Ke2! 7 Kd7 Kxf2! 8 Kxc7 Kxg3 9 Kxb6 f2 10 c7 f1Q 11 c8Q with a theoretically drawn queen ending. This serves as a reminder of how important it is to check for all possible counterattacks, and to analyse any concrete forcing sequences related to them, before drawing up a system of corresponding squares. If we add a white pawn on a4 and a black pawn on a7 in the diagram position, then we have a 'Based on Zinar' position where his system of corresponding squares works as intended: 1 Kc2!

Key squares are b3-d3 and f3-h3. Shortest ways are h4-g5-f6-(e5/e6)-d5-c4-b4 = h2-g1-(f1/f2)-(e1/e2)-(d1/d2)-c2- b2. It follows that there are no corresponding squares on the d-, e- and f-files (it's sufficient if White stays on the same file, which we have indicated by the lines). If Black steps onto the a-file, a counter-attack against the unprotected f- pawn is possible. The systems of corresponding squares on both wings reach the base line because White can't become active.

Here there is no key square at e5 because of the counter-attack via c5 and b4. Let's assume that the white king is already at d4. Due to White's spare tempo Black then couldn't play ...Kd6? (b4! with a transition to A12.02 would then win). Instead he would have to protect the two key squares by ...Kc6! (anti-opposition!) in order to move to the corresponding square d6 only after b4. It follows that d4=b4=1 correspond to c6=1, c4=2=d6 and a5=3=b7 (parries the threat ...Kb4 and protects a6, b6). Amongst the other squares, c3=4=d7 (anti-opposition) or b6. (Kc4 can be answered by the stalemate idea ...Ka5. Thus for Black it follows a5=2.) Further d3=5=c7. Of course with some king positions (for example, wKc3; bKc5 or wKd3; bKd7) the counter ...a5 is possible if Black is able to defend the new key squares. back Idea from N.Grigoriev, 1934 Key squares are d3-d1 and e4, e5. The squares d5 and d4 are not key squares due to the stalemate idea Kf4, and d3 of course can't be accessed at once after Kf4. This stalemate trap is also the reason for the original pair of corresponding squares d5=9=f4. The remaining corresponding squares can be determined as in position 12.04. back After Z.Azmaiparashvili - L.Eolian USSR Spartakiad 1979 Key squares are e6, f6 and g7, h7. Because White can still play the pawn move f4, Black shouldn't take the opposition as in 12.06, but has to avoid it. e5=g5=1=f7, f5=2=e7, e4=g4=3=f8, f4=4=e8 and h6=5=g8 are the pairs of corresponding squares.

back M.Euwe Tidskrift för Schack, 1924 Here the advance c4 plays the decisive role. Since Black has to take twice at c4, e4 isn't protected any longer which leads to the new key square f4 (in addition to f5) on the kingside. On the queenside a pawn-structure of the type 'don't touch me' arises, leading to the pair of corresponding squares c3=b5. Then the shortest ways are d2-(e1/e2)-f2-g3 = c6-(d6/d7)-(e5/e6)-f5 for Black. By this we first determine the corresponding squares on the queenside: d2=1=c6. Connecting square to 1 and c3 or b5 is c2=2=b6. Further, d1=3=c7 and c1=4=b7 both have the same distance to the shortest way. b1 and b2 don't bring anything new and in addition to c7 and c6 are also corresponding squares to a7 and a6. On the kingside we have f2=5=(e5/e6) plus g3=6=f5 and g4=7=e5.

bxc4! bxc4 13 Kxe4! c3 14 Kd3! +- back R.Réti, 1929 Black shouldn't be afraid of an exchange at g4 as long as his king is close enough. If White then uses the h-pawn as a deflecting force, the black king, after capturing the pawn, gets back just in time to the safe square c8. But he has to stay in the square of the h4-pawn to prevent a breakthrough. We conclude that White can only win if he captures the b-pawn first. Thus he has to advance to the key squares c4-f4. The b-pawn covers the c3-square, so the numbering along the key squares only takes place on three files. f3-d3=1-3=f5-d5 and, moving further back, f2-d2=4-6=f6-d6 (the squares on the white baseline aren't corresponding squares because White can't approach from them). If these were all the corresponding squares, Black would lose because he couldn't get back to his system in time. However, one also has to be aware of the possible counter-attack against the a-pawn. Right now Black is short of exactly one tempo. He can queen the b-pawn in six moves, but White on the other hand queens in five moves with check on g8, while ...hxg4 costs another tempo. But this tempo could be saved if the white king were at f3. Therefore Black can also defend himself on the key squares. d4 gets the 5 and e4 the 6. Further e4 is a corresponding square to f2 and thus gets another 4 and d4 is a corresponding square to c2 and thus gets a 7 like c2. We would like to emphasize that these corresponding squares only exist because of the counter-attack. The control of f4 by the g-pawn would normally exclude a defence on the key squares. Moreover, White can penetrate the black position via b3, which explains the remaining corresponding squares.

back V.Halberstadt L'Echequier de Paris, 1954 Both kings can only manoeuvre within the square of the opponent's passed pawn. Furthermore Black has to watch out for a sacrifice of the f-pawn that would be favourable for White. Obvious key squares are d4 and e4. The concluding pairs of corresponding squares are e3=1=e5 (d5 isn't sufficient because of f6) and c3=2=d5 with the connecting square d2=3=d6. It follows at once e2=2. Next, one would like to number the c2-square but to do that one would have to calculate many variations because with c5, c6 and e5 there are three possible corresponding squares for Black. Therefore it is better to deal with the squares on the b-file since Black isn't allowed to step on them. Let's therefore assume the white king is at c3 and the black king is at d5. After Kb4 Black could a priori think about ...Kd6 or the counter-attack ...Kd4, thus against b3=4 there only remains c5 because ...Kd6 fails to Kb4 and ...Ke5 or ...Kc6 to Kc4. From this it also follows c2=5=c6, after which all numbers are assigned. Now we can finally assign the other squares with familiar numbers. One can conclude from the picture that now exists that if Black is to move, he draws by
1...Kd6 or 1...Kd7, while if it is White's move, he wins as follows:
1 Kg2! Kd7 2 Kf1!

9 f6! Kd6 10 Kd4! Ke6 11 Kxe4! Kxf6 12 Kd5! +- back N.Grigoriev Shakhmaty v SSSR, 1938 You have no doubt realized that the starting position doesn't as yet have much to do with corresponding squares. Black just threatens ...a4 with equality. White can only prevent that by playing a4 himself. 1 a4! (D) Only now does the system of corresponding squares become interesting. White's spare tempo makes the determination of the key squares more difficult. They are e6 and e7. Due to the spare tempo the adjacent corresponding squares have to be at a knight's distance (anti-opposition). Thus pairs are f6=1=d7, f5=2=d6, g6=3=c7 and g5=4=c6. Due to Black's possible counter-attack against c4 there are no corresponding squares on the h-file and the eighth rank. One also has to consider that Black at once gets an equal position if he gets the vertical opposition on the seventh or sixth rank.

Now that White has used up his tempo move, the corresponding squares change considerably. The change is not solely in Black's favour, though, as by ruling out the counterattack against c4, White gains access to squares on the 8th rank. Naturally, White chose a moment to play b3 when the two kings were on corresponding squares in the new system. Now Black cannot prevent White from penetrating with his king and winning the b6-pawn.

◼ Related to this study there is a fascinating story which we would like to repeat in brief, following the illustration by Averbakh: "Nikolai Grigoriev died on 10th October 1938. The present study was published in the October edition of the periodical Shakhmaty v SSSR of the same year. Its solution only appeared after the death of the author, in 1939, and in the following version: 1 a4 Kb7 2 Kg5 ...". Only in 1985 (thus 47 years after Grigoriev's death!!) was the above correct solution published in Shakhmaty v SSSR. ECE still says that the position is drawn and the study therefore incorrect. For a pawn ending that looks so easy it is quite unbelievable, don't you think? back 13: Thinking Methods to Find the Right Move In the first 12 chapters we have dealt with the basic ideas and techniques in pawn endings. In this chapter a few thinking methods and fighting methods will be presented. Of course the following reflections are useful in a wider context than just pawn endings. With enough time many pawn endings can be calculated more or less to the end. Now that adjourned games have been virtually abolished, one usually faces a pawn ending with a restricted amount of time. This time must be used in a sensible way. First one should decide how to proceed. Usually it is a good idea to make a list of candidates and to include at first all moves that seem to make any sense. A) The Method of Exclusion B) The Opponent's Possibilities C) Fighting Methods D) Balance of Risks E) Rules of Thumb A) Method of Exclusion But there are also positions in which one can play intuitively according to the motto "if this move doesn't win, the position just isn't won" (positive method of exclusion). We have first chosen such an example. [With the following diagrams, imagine that you have only 2 minutes left to the time-control. What is your 40th move?] A.Shirov - M.Adams Las Palmas 1994 Black threatens to create an outside passed pawn on the queenside by ...b6-b5 and thereby to dissolve his weakness. If White doesn't act in a dynamic way he can't win anyway. Therefore Shirov played 1 h4! (not 1 Kd3? Kc5 2 h4 b5! 3 axb5! Kxb5! 4 h5 Kc5 5 g4 Kd5 6 g5 Ke5 =) and Adams resigned. The key continuation:

After 1 Kd4 Kd6 2 Ke4 Kc5 3 Kxf4 Kd4 White is in zugzwang and loses. There remains only:
1 Kd3!
1 Kd4? Kd6! 2 Ke4 Kc5! 3 Kxf4 Kd4! 4 Kf5 Kd3! 5 Ke5 Kc2! 6 Kd4 Kxb2! 7

1...Kb6
An analogous way of thinking now determines...
2 Kd4!
...as the only remaining move. 1⁄2-1⁄2 Black is unable to make any progress: 2...Kc6 3 Kc4! Kd7 4 Kd3! Kd6 5 Kd4! Ke6?! 6 Ke4! f3! 7 Kxf3 Kd5 8 Ke3 (8 Kf4?? Kd4! -+) 8...Ke5! =. B) The Opponent's Possibilities Here we distinguish between two basically different cases. If we notice that the opponent has an obvious plan or a direct threat we of course have to avoid these possibilities. Looking for the opponent's options might also lead to the conclusion that he hardly has any good moves. This might open up the opportunity to get him in zugzwang. Let's start with the first case: E.Geller - R.Kholmov USSR Ch (Leningrad) 1963 It was actually Black's move in the game, but we shall first consider what would happen with White to play. Black threatens to close the kingside with ...h4. A later exchange with g3 would only lead to a draw. How can we render this threat innocuous? 1 g3! Other moves fail: 1 Kg3? Kf6 2 Kh4 (2 Kf3 h4! =) 2...Kg6! 3 g3 Kh6! =; 1 Kg1? h4! =; 1 h4? Kf6 2 Kg3 Ke6 3 Kf3 Kd5 4 Ke3 Kc4 =.
1...Kf6 2 Kg2 Ke7 3 Kf2 Kd6 4 Ke2
The decisive tempo move! Because of the reserve tempo h3-h4, c4 and d4 are key squares. Taking into account the threat g4, the shortest routes are c5-d5-e6 and d3-e3-f3, giving rise to the correspondences c5-d3, d5-e3 and e6-f3. Further back, the squares e2 and f2 both correspond to d6, so White has a spare square on the second rank.
4...Kd5 5 Ke3! Kc5
Black covers the key square d4, but he moves too far away from the kingside, so that the advance g4 wins. 5...Ke6 6 Kd4! Kd6 7 h4! +-.
6 Kf3! Kd5 7 g4! hxg4+ 8 hxg4! fxg4+
8...Ke6 9 g5! +-.
9 Kxg4! Ke6 10 Kg5! Kf7 11 Kf5! +-
In the game, Kholmov resolved the situation on the kingside, so as to gain the opposition without any trouble:
1...h4! 2 Kg1 Kf7 3 Kf1 Kf6 4 Kf2 Kf7! (D)
4...Ke6? 5 g4 hxg3+ 6 Kxg3! Kf6 7 Kf3 Kg6 8 Ke3! Kh5 9 Kd4! +-.
5 Ke3 Ke6
On the kingside it is sufficient for Black to occupy the same file (because of his control of e4). In the battle on the c- and d-files for the key squares c5, d5 and e5, it is necessary to maintain the opposition.
6 Ke2 Ke7! 7 Kd1 Kd7!
7...Ke6? 8 Kc2! +-; 7...Kd6? 8 Kd2! +-.
8 Kd2 Kd6 9 Ke2 Ke7 10 Kd3 Kd7! 1⁄2-1⁄2
In 1898, Neustadtl (ECE 1204) created the position wKe4,Pf5,g4,h4; bKd6,Pf6,h6 in which there is in addition to the win shown above a possible win by moving to the queenside: 1 Kd4 Kc6 2 Kc4 Kd6 3 Kb5 +-. Now we proceed to the second case: R.Fischer - A.Bisguier USA Ch (New York) 1959/60 If Black moves his king, then White's king can advance, so Black has to move his pawns forward, but this makes them more vulnerable. Fischer decided on a wait-and-see strategy:
1 Kf3!?
1 g5?! Kf5! 2 Kd4 Kxg5! 3 Kxc4 Kf6 =.
1...a5!
1...b5? 2 Ke3! a6 3 g5! Kf5 4 Kd4! Kxg5 5 Kc5! +-; 1...Kf6? 2 Kf4! Kg6 3 Ke5!

2 g5 Kf5 3 Ke3 Kxg5 4 Kd4 Kf4 5 Kxc4 Ke3 6 Kb5 Kd3 7 Kxa5 Kc2! =.
2...a4!
Bisguier defends ingeniously. By moving his a-pawn forward, he makes it very difficult for White's king to capture the pawns. At the same time he prepares a break with ...b5-b4, so the white king is confined to the zone a5-f5-f1. Not

Kb4! = C) Fighting Methods In this respect many pawn endings don't offer much, especially when the pawn- structure isn't fixed, but even here there is still something one can do: V.Jansa - E.Prandstetter Czechoslovak Ch (Prague) 1986 Though in this nearly symmetrical position White is a little bit better due to his advantage in space, a path to victory can't be detected. We have already seen that first the king should advance as far as possible, so the first move is quite obvious:
1 Kd4
Black plays according to the same motto:
1...Kd6
However, it's not so easy now to find a promising plan for making progress. The list of candidates is long (nearly every pawn move can be considered) but which one bothers the opponent most? Jansa makes a good choice with the h-pawn. Perhaps he might threaten h5 himself and if Black plays ...h5, he can add some spice by f3 and g4. 2 h4!? Black also has a great choice, but he decides to prevent the constant menace of h4-h5.
2...h5
2...g6 3 g4 b6 4 a4 h5 5 gxh5 gxh5! 6 b4. Now it's a difficult situation for Black,
which he solves best by clearing up the position on the queenside immediately: a) 6...a6? 7 Ke4! Ke6 8 Kf4 f6!? (8...Kd5 9 Kg5! +-; 8...Kf6 9 b5 a5 10 f3! +-)

Even though the game ended with the expected draw, Vlastimil Jansa nevertheless forced his opponent to find a couple of very accurate moves. This is what you should also try in better positions (of course with calculated risks). In the next game the manoeuvres were even crowned by success: E.Lobron - N.Sehner Bundesliga 1984/5 Though White is a little bit better, his advantage shouldn't lead to a win by normal means. Therefore one should, as in the previous example, try to make the opponent's task as difficult as possible. To start with, Lobron just improves his position:
1 Kd4 a5 2 a3 Kc6?
Misplacing the king. 2...a4! is necessary. 3 g4 Not 3 bxa5? bxa5! 4 a4 Kd6 5 g4 hxg4 6 hxg4 g5 7 fxg5 fxg5 8 Ke4 Kc5 9 Ke5! Kxc4 10 Kxe6! (10 Kf6? Kd4! 11 Kxg5 {11 Kxe6 Ke4! -+} 11...e5! -+)

3...hxg4 4 hxg4 Kd6 5 g5 fxg5 6 fxg5 a4
6...e5+ 7 Ke4? (triangulating by 7 Kd3 wins as in the main line) 7...a4! (not
7...Ke6? 8 bxa5 bxa5 9 c5! a4 10 c6! Kd6 11 c7! Kxc7 12 Kxe5! +-) and then:
a) 8 b5?! Ke6 (8...Kc5 9 Kxe5 Kxc4 10 Kf6 Kb3! =) 9 Ke3 =. b) 8 Ke3 Kd7 = allows Black to defend successfully.
7 Ke4?
Garth Sylbing found the surprising retreat 7 Ke3 (in order to triangulate), which wins: 7...Ke5 (7...e5 8 Ke4! +-; 7...Kd7 8 Ke4! Kd6 9 Kd4 +-) 8 Kd3! Kf5 9 c5! bxc5 10 bxc5! Ke5 11 Kc4 +-.
7...e5!
Not 7...Kd7? 8 Ke5! Ke7 9 b5 Kd7 10 Kf6! +-. Black has found the only move and now White can't make any progress. Thus Lobron tries to provoke mistakes with the help of the following king moves:
8 Kf3
8 c5+ doesn't run away: 8...bxc5! 9 bxc5+! Kxc5 10 Kxe5! Kc4! and Black draws.
8...Kd7 9 Ke2 Ke6 10 Kd3 (D)
10...Kd7
Or 10...Kf5: a) 11 c5 bxc5 12 bxc5! e4+! 13 Ke3 (13 Kd4 Kf4! 14 c6 e3! 15 Kd3 Kf3! 16 c7 e2! 17 c8Q e1Q! =) 13...Ke5! 14 c6 Kd6! 15 Kxe4 Kxc6! 16 Ke5 Kc5! 17 Kf6 Kc4! =. b) 11 Ke3 Ke6 12 Ke4 Kd6! =.
11 Kc3 Kd6 12 Kc2 Kd7 13 Kd1!?
Is this really a problem with corresponding squares? At least White's manoeuvre causes a first black weakening:
13...e4?! 14 Kd2
Now Sehner chooses the wrong one of the two plausible options:
14...Kd6?
14...Ke6! 15 Ke3 (15 Ke2 Ke5! 16 Ke3 Kf5! =) 15...Kf5! 16 c5 bxc5! 17 bxc5!
Ke5! 18 c6 Kd6! 19 Kxe4 Kxc6! 20 Ke5 Kc5! =.
15 Ke3! 1-0
Because of 15...Ke5 16 b5! +-. D) Balance of Risks For the last two examples we again assume that there are only two minutes left for the last move before the time-control: Berger - Bauer corr. 1889 In this position White can't lose if he doesn't do anything. We therefore first have to reach our time-control:
1 Kf4!?
This would be the best practical try in time-trouble. 1 Ke3 Kg5 2 c4 Kxg4 (for
2...bxc3 see the main line) 3 Ke4 Kg5 4 Ke5! Kg6 5 Ke6 +-. 1 c4 was played in
the actual game.
1...Kf6
Now one can sit back and calculate if there is a way to win. Since this can only be managed by a breakthrough on the queenside, this example is very suitable for the exact calculation of variations. The way to victory isn't so straightforward as it looks at first sight.
2 c4 bxc3 3 Ke3! Kg5
We have now rejoined the correspondence game. 4 a4!! Kxg4 5 b4! axb4 6 Kd3! +- This move had to be found in the calculation because 6 a5? b3! 7 Kd3! b2! 8 Kc2! Kf4 9 a6! Ke3! 10 a7! b1Q+ 11 Kxb1! Kd2! 12 a8Q c2+! 13 Ka2 c1Q! = is still a draw but compared to the starting position troublesome. 1-0 The next example is an anticipation of Chapter 15: K.Müller - J.Szabolcsi Budapest 1991 Black, who had a good position the whole game long, committed himself with the last move before the time-control by 1...Qf5+?!. Such key, irreversible decisions should not be made under great time-pressure. Otherwise, however, White could continue in such a way that this opportunity wouldn't exist any longer.
1...Qd1+ 2 Kg2 Qf3+ (2...Qxa4?! 3 Qxh7+! Kg5 4 Qxg7+! Kf5! 5 Bh7+ Ke6! 6
Bg8+ Kf5! =) 3 Kg1 Qg4+ (not 3...e3? 4 Qxh7+! Kg5 5 Qxg7+! Kh4 {5...Kf5 6 Qg2 +-} 6 Qg3+ Qxg3+ 7 hxg3+! Kxg3 8 Bc4 +-) and now 4 Kf1 = (perpetual check). Even 4 Kh1 is playable: 4...g6 5 Qxh7+! Kg5 6 Bf7! =.
1...g6 2 Qxh7+! Kg5 3 Bf7! =.
2 Ke1!?
Now Black is forced to reverse his last move and to give up the protection of the knight by the queen. Otherwise White simplifies into a winning pawn ending.
2...h4?
Or: a) 2...g6? 3 h4! Qd7 (3...g5 4 Bxh7! Qxh7 5 Qxf6+! Qg6 6 Qh8+! Qh7 7 hxg5+! Kg6 8 Qf6#!) 4 Bxh7 Qxh7 5 Qxh7+ Kxh7 6 a5 +-. b) 2...Qf3? 3 Qxh7+! Kg5 4 Qxg7+! Kf5!? (4...Kh4?! 5 Qg3+! Qxg3+ 6 hxg3+! Kxg3 7 Be6 +-) 5 Qg3! Qh1+ 6 Ke2!: b1) 6...h4 7 Qh3+! Kg5 8 Bh7 +-. b2) 6...Qc1 7 Bh7+! Ke6 8 Qb3+! Ke7 (after 8...Kd6 9 Qd1+ Qxd1+ 10 Kxd1! Kd5 11 Bxe4+ Kxe4 12 a5! +- the black king is in the square of the a-pawn but the c6-pawn is in his way) 9 Bf5 +-. b3) 6...c5 7 Bf7 +-. b4) 6...Qb1 7 Qc3 Qb7 8 a5 +-. c) 2...Qf4! 3 Qxh7+ Kg5 4 Qxg7+ Kf5! = and because of the active position of the black queen, White can't make any progress.
3 Qxh7+
3 Bxh7 g6 4 Qg8! +-.
3...Qxh7 4 Bxh7! Kxh7 5 a5 g5 6 a6 g4 7 a7 g3 8 hxg3 h3 9 Kf1! +-
After 9 a8Q?? h2! -+ the queen would be helpless against the pawns. 1-0 E) Rules of Thumb As is often the case in life, the art is to know not the rules but the exceptions. For a better orientation we again summarize: the king should be activated an extra pawn wins almost all the time protected passed pawns are very favourable outside passed pawns deflect the opponent's king isolated pawns and doubled pawns are generally unfavourable no rule can replace concrete calculation Furthermore one should be familiar with the following concepts: opposition (distant, diagonal, virtual), key squares, passed pawn (outside, protected, connected), square rule, majority, breakthrough, zugzwang, reciprocal zugzwang, corresponding squares, triangulation, encirclement, king-march, fight for tempi, fortress, liquidation of one wing, ... 14: Complicated Cases We now offer a few difficult practical examples. Therefore you should get out your board and set, if you haven't already done so. There are several ways to approach our analysis. The easiest way is just to replay it. But it is also beneficial to play the positions out (even if it has to be versus a computer) and then to compare the game and your thoughts with the analysis. Thereby it's quite possible that you soon get on other tracks than we do. The four exercises are also suitable for playing out. This time our structuring doesn't depend on the content. Nevertheless you should start with the first three examples. Afterwards we look at the top world class and conclude with a very detailed analysis by Claus Dieter ('CD') Meyer. A) Out of Life B) At the Highest Level C) C.D. Analyses A) Out of Life We start with a rapid chess game. After a knight exchange both players only had 5 minutes left for the pawn ending: F.Lamprecht - Kaye Eimsbüttel rapidplay 1995 What is White to do? Obviously he is worse. On the kingside the tempi are distributed evenly and on the queenside Black threatens to advance to the weaknesses b4 or d4; then ...c6-c5 could give the decisive spare tempo. However, White can save the game if he offers a temporary pawn sacrifice by b4 at the right time, though in order to do that, White shouldn't have a disadvantage of tempi on the kingside and he has to keep the base f3. In this sense White's first move is logical: 1 g4!?
1 f4 and now:
a) 1...exf4 2 gxf4! Kd6 (2...h6? 3 e5! fxe5 4 fxe5! b5 5 Kd3 bxa4 6 bxa4! Kb6 7 e6 Kc7 8 c5! +-) 3 b4 c5! 4 bxa5 bxa5! 5 Kd3 =. b) 1...g5 2 fxg5 fxg5! 3 g4! h6 4 h3 b5 5 axb5 cxb5! 6 cxb5! Kxb5! 7 Kd3 =.
1...h5?!
This is not a good idea because the balance of tempi on the kingside becomes much worse.
1...b5 2 cxb5 cxb5! 3 axb5! Kxb5 4 h4 is a draw.

1...h5!
1...Kf6? 2 Kg4! h5+ 3 Kxh5! Kxf5 4 a3 a6 5 a4 +-.
2 f4!? After 2 h4?? gxh4+ 3 Kxh4 Kf6! 4 Kxh5 Kxf5! -+ the white king is suddenly cut off. Time for a stocktaking. Plausible candidates are 2...g4 and 2...Kf6. Their value can only be determined by concrete calculation. If one doesn't have much time, one has to become general. After 2...g4 3 Kh4 Kf6 4 Kxh5 Kxf5 5 Kh6 Black can't take at f4 at once because of Kg6. With a pawn less, he should therefore be lost. Let's now look at 2...Kf6. At first sight the clear-cut 3 fxg5+ Kxg5 4 f6 Kxf6 5 Kf4 doesn't look good. On the other hand, White also has to consider the counterplay against the h-pawn after 5...Kg6. If possible one should continue the calculations, but without further calculation (time) 2...Kf6 is preferable.
2...g4?
2...Kf6! 3 fxg5+ Kxg5! 4 f6 Kxf6! 5 Kf4 Kg6! 6 h3 (6 h4 Kf6! 7 a3 a6! 8 b4

In the ending Q+P vs Q with a cut-off king the following general rule is valid: the bishop's pawn offers the greatest winning chances, followed by central pawns and knight's pawns. Positions with a rook's pawn are usually drawn. Therefore here it's much more favourable to go through with the a-pawn.

Kantsler resigned because it is impossible for Black to avoid the exchange of queens. In the third example the defender again faces a very difficult task. S.Grabov - E.Gausel Års 1995 Though White loses the e5-pawn, his hopes are still alive because of the closed structure.
1...Kf7 2 Kf3 Ke6 3 Kf4

3...Kd5 4 e6 Kxe6
Capturing the e-pawn was very easy. But how should Black continue now? Right now the plan to penetrate with the king via e5 doesn't work because the g5-pawn can't be captured, e.g. 5 a3 Kd6 6 Kg3 Ke5 7 Kf3 f4 8 Kg4 f3 9 Kxf3 Kf5 10 h4 =. Therefore Einar Gausel has the plan of first moving the king to g7 and then playing ...h6. Without the h-pawns, the g-pawn can't be kept. So White has to play very precisely to reach a very difficult, but probably tenable, queen ending.

Because of 27 Kd3 Kxa3 28 Kc3 Ka2! 29 Kc2 a3! -+. B) At the Highest Level There was a lively discussion in the chess press concerning the following position (for example, H.J.Hecht in CBM 51, page 49ff; R.Knaak in CBM 52, page 57; J.Timman in NIC 2/96, page 43 and 3/96, pages 6 and 35; as well as A.Shirov in NIC 2/96, page 36): A.Shirov - J.Timman Wijk aan Zee 1996 White has three potential winning plans: 1) A breakthrough by g5 followed by h4 and f5 or to build a protected passed pawn (this plan was chosen by Shirov in the game); 2) To centralize the king via f3-e4-e5 and then to get Black into zugzwang in order either to win the c-pawn or to go through with the f-pawn (which was suggested by Timman); and finally 3) To penetrate with the king via g3-h4-g5 on the kingside. However, none of the three plans leads to a win. Nevertheless, with the win in sight and the power of persuasion Alexei Shirov played... 1 g5!? The desired effect followed soon: Black resigned! 1-0?? Timman's way of thinking was probably as follows. "If Black captures the c- pawn White gets the opportunity for a breakthrough on the kingside by which a seemingly decisive protected passed pawn on f6 results." The first publications after the game agreed with the verdict of the two players until Sven Joachim finally proved the draw in a letter to Schachwoche. The third plan isn't dangerous for Black at all: 1 Kg3 Kd6! 2 Kh4 Kxc6! 3 Kg5 Kd5 4 Kf6 = (4 Kh6 Ke4 5 Kxh7 Kxf4 6 Kxg6 Kxg4 7 h4 =). The second plan demands more detailed analysis. 1 Kf3 (Timman) 1...Kd6 2 Ke4 Kxc6 3 Ke5 Kd7! 4 Kf6 (D) and now: a) 4...c5?! 5 Ke5 Kc6! 6 h3 c4 7 Kd4 Kb5! 8 h4: a1) 8...Kb6?!: a11) 9 f5 gxf5! 10 g5 Kb5! 11 h5! f4! 12 g6 hxg6 13 hxg6 f3! =. a12) 9 h5 gxh5 10 gxh5 Kb5 11 h6 c3 12 Kxc3 Kc5 13 Kd3 Kd5 14 Ke3 Ke6 15 Ke4 Kf6 = (12.05). a13) 9 g5 Kb5!

Variant of Shirov - Timman Wijk aan Zee 1996 If in the starting position one moves the black king to f7, the plan chosen by Shirov in the game wins, as the analysis above has already shown. The plan to penetrate with the king on the kingside also wins but the march of the king through the centre doesn't, because here Black surprisingly has enough resources to draw. 1 g5!?

Ke6 5 Kf3 +- Now let's look at an even higher-level game: A.Karpov - A.Shirov Buenos Aires 1994 For a weaker player it would soon become very difficult to hold the position against either one of these two players. Nevertheless we want to try to understand some of the thoughts with the help of the analysis by Shirov in Informator 62. The position is in a way sharpened by the different majorities. In general the shorter majority is favourable, but here this is by far outweighed by Black's right to move and his space advantage on the kingside.

(5...b5? 6 Ke4 b4 7 Kd4 a5 8 Ke4! +-) 6 c4 arrives at a very interesting position. Black, who has the more active king, must ensure that his a-pawn stays on the board, so that he doesn't get into trouble with his backward f-pawn. b1) 6...f5? loses, because Black gives up the reserve tempo ...f6, and the active idea of exchanging pawns on the kingside fails by a hair's breadth. 7 b4! f4+ (7...h4 8 gxh4 +-) 8 gxf4+!

After, e.g., 17 Kf5 cxb4 18 Ke4!, the final curtain comes down. Chapter 14 Exercises solution solution solution solution Solutions to Chapter 14 Exercises Teichmann - Blackburne Berlin 1897 For a better understanding of this important position, which has already been analysed many times (Averbakh, for example, devotes three pages to it (Av 580, page 287ff)), we want to make some preliminary considerations. Black has an extra pawn at c6, and this offers him an important spare tempo. He therefore has to create a position in which this tempo is useful. The pawn formation on the kingside offers the idea ...h4 (or rarely ...g4). Because of the outside passed pawn, White then can't take at h4. If White remains passive, Black takes at g3 and after White takes back he plays ...Kf5, which secures the advance to f4. Only then is the spare tempo used to enable a winning encirclement. After the plan is clear, one has to consider the counter f4 when looking for the right moment for the advance ...h4. The analysis shows that ...h4 wins with the following king positions: bKe5 vs wKh3, h2, g1 or f2; bKe6, f6 or g6 vs wKh2, g1 or f2; bKf5 vs wKg2. It follows that Black wins in the quickest way if he carries out a triangulation at f6, e6 and e5 because White can only oscillate between h3 and g2.

The white king is not in the square of the passed a-pawn, so he has to do everything possible to queen his connected passed pawns. Dr Michael Berndt analysed this position in Jugendschach 3/89 in a series about pawn endings, which caused co-author Müller to have a closer look at this position himself (see Jugendschach 5/89, page 27ff). 1 d5

back 15: Simplifications Before the pawn ending the gods have placed simplification. Fortunately we have accumulated enough knowledge in the previous chapters to be ready to master this important aspect of the game. Well, apart from the few other endings. Of course we have also struggled with the evaluations, as it has been extremely difficult to keep to the 'Nunn Convention' in this chapter (particularly we distinguish between += and +/- but not between =+, = and += or +/- and +-). It should also be said that the examples are ordered by typical considerations while the exercises, with the exception of the concluding study, are arranged by the distribution of material. A) Correctly Assessing Various Endgames B) Good Technique C) Combination A) Correctly Assessing Various Endgames How should one make the right choice when you must decide how and whether to simplify with a limited amount of time? Well, pawn endings differ from most piece endings in such a way that you can arrive at a definite result by concrete calculation if there is enough time available. The following example is typical for this: A.Shirov - V.Ivanchuk USSR Junior Team Ch (Kramatorsk) 1989 Alexei Shirov had calculated that he wins after...
1 Rxh7!
The assessment of the rook ending after 1 Rxb5? is 'of course' only a draw:
1...Rh2+ 2 Ke3 (2 Ke1 Ra2 3 Rb3 f4 4 d5 Kf5 5 d6 Ke6 6 Rd3 Kd7 =) 2...Rh3+
3 Kf4 Rxa3 4 Rb6+ Kf7 5 Kxf5 Ra5+ 6 Ke4 Ke7 and Black has reached the
Philidor position. White can't make any progress because after 7 d5 Ra1 8 Ke5 his king has no shelter against the checks from behind: 8...Re1+ 9 Kd4 Rd1+ 10 Kc5 Rc1+ =.
1...Kxh7 2 Kf3 Kg7
2...Kg6 3 Kf4! Kf6 4 d5! Kg6 5 Ke5! +-.
3 Kf4! Kg6 4 Ke5! 1-0
Ivanchuk resigned because after 4...Kg5 5 d5! f4 6 d6! +- the d-pawn goes through with check. Now two simplifications that lead to a draw: V.Topalov - A.Antunes Candas 1992 Like the rook ending in the previous example, the knight ending should also be drawn, but it's easier to calculate the simplification 1 Nxf5+ until the end, though one needs the knowledge from Chapter 3 in order to reach a safe haven:
1 Nxf5+!?
1 Kc3?! Nh4!? =+ still demands precise play from White (1...Nxd4 2 Kxd4! Kc6
3 Ke5! Kd7 4 f5! exf5 5 Kxd5! =; 1...Ke7 2 Nxf5+ exf5! 3 Kb4! Kd6 4 Kb5! =).
1...exf5! 2 Kd4! Kc6 3 Ke5! Kc5 4 Kxf5! d4 5 Kg6!

Stalemate. A.Munteanu - D.Moldovan Bucharest 1992 Since one is never sure whether the black passed pawn at e3 isn't too strong in a queen ending, a simplification is a very safe way to a draw:

A.Shirov - V.Akopian Oakham (junior) 1992 In the battle for the tournament victory it seemed as if Alexei Shirov had already missed his winning chances until Akopian surprisingly simplified into a pawn ending:

Instead he had a study-like way to hold the position: a) Not 1...Ke6?, which is too passive. 2 c5 bxc5 (2...Kd5 3 c6! Ke6 4 Ng3 Kd6 5 Nf5+ Ke6 6 Nh4 +-) 3 a5! (3 Nxc5+? Kd5 =) 3...Kd7 4 Nxc5+! Kc7 (4...Kd6 5 b6 axb6 6 a6! +-; 4...Kc8 5 Nd3 Bh1 6 Ne1 h2 7 Ng2! +-) 5 Ne6+ Kd7 (5...Kd6

The last assessment problem was again proposed by the trainer in Hamburg, Claus Dieter Meyer: A.Keller - C.Schubert Bundesliga 1985/6 Surprisingly, only the pawn ending after 1 Nxc6 is a win. The knight ending after 1 Nd5?, as played in the game, contains so many traps that one might even lose. 1...b4! (1...f5? 2 gxf5! h6 3 h4 +-) 2 Nxf6 (the game concluded 2 cxb4+ Nxb4+! 3 Nxb4 Kxb4! 1⁄2-1⁄2) and now: a) 2...bxc3? 3 Kxc3 Nd4 4 Nxh7 Nxf3 5 h3! Kd6 6 Kd3! Ke7 7 Ke3!

B) Good Technique The giving back of material in order to simplify into a won pawn ending is standard. Often it's the way to win that costs the least time and energy. C.Hansen - J.Piket Wijk aan Zee 1994 Curt Hansen could now have captured the b-pawn with his queen but why complicate, if a queen sacrifice is a clear win?
1 Qxf5!?
1 Qd2+ Kh7 2 Qh2+ Rh5 (2...Kg7 3 Qb2+ Kg8 4 Qxb7 +-) 3 Qb8 +-; after
3...Rxc5?! 4 Qc7+! Kh6 5 Qf4+! Kg7 6 Qd4+! the rook is lost.
1 Qxb7? (bad technique!) gives away half a point because by 1...Rxc5 2 Qe7 Rf5
3 Qd8 Kh7 4 Qd7+ Kh6 5 Qxc6 Kg7 (but not 5...Rh5? 6 Qf6! Kh7 7 Qf7+! Kh6
8 Qg8! Rg5+ 9 Kf4 Rf5+ 10 Ke4 +-) Black can build a fortress: 6 Qd7+ Kg8 7
Qe7 Kh8 8 Qh4+ Kg7 = (8...Kg8?! 9 Qh6 Rf7! 10 Kg5 Rh7 =).
1...gxf5+ 2 Kxf5! Kh5 3 Ke5 Kg5 4 Kd6! Kf5 5 Kc7! Ke6 6 Kxb7! 1-0
Even though it worked so well in the previous example, one has to be cautious with simplifications into a pawn ending: D.Pirrot - C.Gabriel Bad Wörishofen 1996 Pirrot wanted to make things easy in this totally won position.
1 Qxd8+??
However, he was now confronted with an unpleasant surprise. He could have won by 1 Qc4+ Kb7 2 a4 Rc8 3 Qxc8+ Kxc8 4 Kd6! +- (but not 4 b5? Kd7!! 5 Kd5 a5! = or 4 Ke6? b5! 5 a5 Kc7! 6 Ke7 Kc6! =).
1...Kxd8! 2 Kd6 b5! 3 Kc6 a5! 1⁄2-1⁄2
Of course the plan to give back material could be longer-term. The plan to simplify into a pawn ending is demonstrated in the next example: Variation from P.Florath - S.Löffler Bundesliga 1995/6 The white passed pawns on the queenside threaten to go through by a4-a5 and b6, so Black has to be careful. But his king arrives just in time to exploit the bishop's fixed position with a beautiful exchange sacrifice:
1...Kf7 2 Kd3
2 Kf3 Ke7 3 Kg4 g6 4 a4 Kd7 5 a5 Rxa6 -+.
2...Ke7 3 a4 Kd7 4 a5 Kc7
4...Rf8?? 5 b6! +-.
5 Kd4 Kb8
After 5...Rxa6?? Black couldn't prevent the white king from penetrating: 6 bxa6! Kb8 7 Kc4! g5 8 Kd4 (8 Kb5? g4 9 Kc6 h5! =) 8...Ka7 9 Ke4! Kxa6 10 Kf5! Kb5 (10...Kxa5 11 Ke6! g4 12 Kxd6! h5 13 Kc6 +-) 11 Kg6 Kxa5 12 Kxh6! g4
13 Kg5 Kb5 14 Kxg4! Kc5 15 h4 Kxd5 16 Kf5! and White wins.
6 Ke4 Rxa6!? 7 bxa6 g6!
The white king has no way to get in. Black just collects the two a-pawns, and will then deal with the d-pawn. A white attempt on the kingside fails:
8 h4 Ka7 9 h5 g5 10 Kf5 Kxa6 11 Ke6 g4! -+
C) Combination With tactical clashes it is important to assess the resulting positions quickly and correctly. If in one line a pawn ending results, you can apply your knowledge. K.Aseev - A.Sidorov Kstovo 1996 Due to his more active pieces, White is a lot better but it's not so easy to see how to make further progress. Fortunately the simplifying combination wins.
1 Bxd6!? Bxd6 2 Rcxc8 Rxc8 3 Rxc8! Kxc8 4 Nxd6+! Kb8 5 Nxb7! Kxb7
Now White can penetrate with his king on the kingside, though he must be careful with the pawns to prevent Black from closing the position. 6 h4
6 f4 also wins, e.g. 6...Kc7 7 f5 Kd6 8 g4 h4 9 Kf3 Kc5 10 Ke3 Kd6 (10...Kxb5
11 Kd3 Kc5 12 Kc3 b5 13 Kb3 +-) 11 Kd3 Kc5 12 Kc3 Kd6 13 Kc4 Kc7 14

Because after 8 Kxg3 Kc7 9 Kh4 +- the white king penetrates successfully.

back M.Ulybin - S.Temirbaev Cheliabinsk 1993 So far we have only seen successful simplifications, so it is time for a counter- example:
1...Rxf3+?
1...Ra3!? 2 Ng5+ Kg8! 3 Ne6 Rxa4+ 4 Kg5 Re4 5 Nxc7 Kf7! -+.
Temirbaev underestimates the weakness of the c7-pawn and probably overvalues his protected passed pawn on d6 (but it's also possible that he missed 4 f7! during his calculations). However, the protected passed pawn alone doesn't secure the win; as we shall see, it doesn't even insure against loss.
2 Kxf3! g5?
This was probably the idea behind 1...Rxf3+ but it only makes things worse.

He therefore only has two different basic plans. Either he simplifies immediately into a pawn ending or he breaks through at an appropriate time, whereupon the resulting outside passed pawns tear apart the knight. Have you also assessed the pawn ending as won?

back I.Rogers - A.Shirov Groningen 1990 White will have to sacrifice his rook for the h-pawn if he wants to make any progress. Thus knowledge about pawn endings is also necessary. Black first has to play ...f6 before he can simplify by ...Kg2:

While the outside passed a-pawn doesn't count for so much in a rook ending, it is decisive in a pawn ending. In this position White therefore has to act very accurately to avoid losing:
1 Bxf7+?
This offers Black the game on a silver platter. Instead 1 Ke4! (not 1 Ba2? Ra5! -/+ or 1 Rd7? Bb5! 2 Rd8+ Kg7 3 Ke3 Rc7 -/+) 1...Bc4 (1...Bg2+ 2 f3! Bxf3+ 3 Kxf3! Rxd5! 4 Rxa7! =) 2 Bxc4! Rxc4+! 3 Kd3 Ra4 4 h4 =+ would have simplified into an uncomfortable but theoretically drawn rook ending.

But one always has to consider a counter-attack towards the h-pawn and the advance e4 because of which, for example, the position with kings at f4 and g6 is not reciprocal zugzwang (compare Constantini ECE 1007).

back J.Speelman - M.Chandler Hastings 1988/9 The most important drawn position in rook endings stems from Philidor. Knowledge of it and Bähr's Rule make the solution obvious:

Kd6 1⁄2-1⁄2 back F.Gheorghiu - C.Lutz Biel 1990 The fork 1 Rb6!? is well worth calculating. But have you also seen ...fxe5, d5 after the exchange of rooks? If you knew the endgame tablebase by heart you could of course have also won by 1 exf6?!, though after 1...Rxf6 you have to play 2 Rb6! anyway: 2...Rf1 (2...Rf5+ 3 d5 Ke7 4 Rb7+!

3 d5! +- 1-0 back C.Wilhelmi - R.Vogel 2nd Bundesliga 1996
1 Nxh4 normally shouldn't be considered: the king is badly placed, the knight is
at the edge of the board, the queenside is weak and the bishop is better for play on both wings. Therefore, White has very good reason first of all to calculate the pawn ending.
1 Nd4+!
Since it is won, fortunately the complications after 1 Nxh4? = don't have to be examined in more detail; there White is even in danger of losing.
1...Kd5 2 Nxe6! Kxe6 3 Kf2! Kd5 4 g3?
4 Kf3!? (Wilhelmi) 4...Kxc5 (4...Ke5 5 Ke3 Ke6 6 Kd4 +-) and now:
a) 5 Kf4? b5! (Black avoids committing his king; instead, 5...Kc4? 6 g3! hxg3 7 Kxg3! is winning for White) 6 g3 (6 Kxf5 Kc4 =) 6...hxg3! 7 Kxg3 Kd5 and against all odds Black is able to defend, with the move ...b5 coming in very useful by denying White any queenside pawn moves: 8 Kf4 Ke6! 9 h3 (9 Kg5 Ke5! =) 9...Kf6! 10 h4 Kg6! 11 Ke5 a6! =. b) 5 g3!? hxg3 (5...h3 6 Kf4 Kc4 7 Kxf5!

back V.Dragiev - E.Ermenkov Bulgarian Ch 1995 All black pawns are fixed on light squares, so the knight can draw despite the minus pawn. However, due to the aggressive pawn-structure on the kingside one has to proceed carefully: 1 h4!? The game actually concluded 1 Nxe6?

back A.Moise - F.Lamprecht Dresden 1997 Of course Black would like to play 1...Bxc3 because the alternatives don't seem to be very promising. But how can one then prevent the white king from decisively getting to e4? The solution is to get a pawn to g4 in order to take away the access to the f3-square. Without this finesse the pawn ending would be hopeless:

Since staying in the rook ending isn't sufficient for a win and Black can save himself with the help of a stalemate trick after 1 Rf1+?, the only move to win is...
1 O-O+!!
In studies one is allowed to castle no matter how improbable it might seem that neither the king nor the rook have moved before if it can't be proved by the position that castling is forbidden.

back 16: Exercises Our last chapter should be understood as a sort of test. We have therefore divided it in three sections: Section A is dedicated to the fundamental ideas. If you have studied the book carefully, these exercises should all be solvable. Section B features more difficult exercises. Section C differs from the first two sections in that it's not so much concrete moves that count but rather the assessment of the position and the correct plan. These exercises are therefore very suitable to be played out or for analysis training. The solutions include a reference to the chapter (or chapters) which contain ideas relevant to that position.

If Black plays very accurately he can hold this position due to the activity of his king because his h-pawn is already quite far advanced and Bähr's Rule often predicts a draw when White creates a passed pawn on the queenside by Kb3 and a4.

However, he failed to profit from White's mistake: after 1...Kb5? 2 Kb3! 1-0 the game was over (see 10.11) and Stefan Sievers became the under-17 champion. Black should have played:

(See Chapter 12.) If White immediately tries to capture the b-pawn, then Black draws with his f- pawn against the queen. Therefore White first has to conquer the corresponding squares in order to exchange the f- and g-pawns. Surprisingly, it is not enough for Black to get the (distant) opposition according to the corresponding squares, because White can use the squares c6, c7 and d7 to win:
1 Kc6!!

◼ During a training session in 1985, Herman van Riemsdijk wanted to present a study by Weenink (wKf3,Pg2,b4; bKg5,Pb5,f4: 1 Ke4! Kg4 2 Kd5 Kh5 3 Kc6 Kg5 4 Kc5! Kg4 5 Kd6! +-) but by mistake placed the b-pawns at b5 and b6. The resulting study has the solution 1 Ke4! Kg4 2 Kd5 Kh5 3 Kd6 Kh6 4 Kc7 Kh5 5 Kd7 Kg5 6 Kc6! +- (see The Final Countdown, page 48f). back A.Ilyin-Zhenevsky - A.Alekhine USSR Ch (Moscow) 1920 (See Chapter 11.) The black king has to defend the h4-pawn and it seems inevitable that he will fall into zugzwang. However, Alekhine found the only way to keep the balance:
1...a5!
1...b5? 2 b4! c5 3 e5! cxb4 (3...dxe5 4 bxc5! +-) 4 exd6! bxc3 5 d7! +-; 1...b6? 2

White can't make progress: 4 Kg2 (4 b3 b4! =) 4...Kf6 5 Kh2 Kg6! 6 Kg2 Kf6 7 b3 b4! (7...Kg5? 8 Kh2! +-; 7...Kg6? 8 Kh3! Kg5 9 a3! +-) 8 Kh3 Kg5! =. back Hooper New Statesman, 1961 (See Chapters 5 and 12.) It's easy to see that the black f-pawn falls. But the black h-pawn is still at h7, and if you have studied Chapters 5 and 12, you are probably already on the scent. In fact the simple capturing of the f-pawn only leads to a draw since after Kxf5 Black still has the answer ...Ke7 (see 12.07). However, this is a reciprocal zugzwang and thus White is successful if he considers the corresponding squares shown in the diagram (the dotted line only serves for orientation purposes; it separates the systems of the attacker and the defender; of course White can, for example, get to e7 himself, whereupon ...Kg7 is the only answer because the key square f7 has to be defended).

Seirawan, who defended well in the queen ending despite his time-trouble, later lost on time. back R.Emerson - J.Nunn London 1969 (See Chapters 3 and 8.) You have certainly seen that 1...Kf5!? is the only sensible move (if he moves to the seventh or sixth rank later queens can be exchanged by Qa7+ or Qb6+ and after 1...Kh5 the queen is lost at once). But have you also noticed that White can nevertheless win?

back Xie Jun - V.Hort Prague (Women-Veterans) 1995 (See Chapter 10.) After 1 g3! the b-pawn becomes weak so Black has to liquidate the pawns as soon as possible:
1...Kg6!?
1...f6?! 2 f4+! Kg6 3 exf6! Kxf6 4 g4 +-.
2 Kd3?
Targeting the b5-pawn, but this move is only good enough to draw. White even loses after 2 g4? Kg5! -+ or 2 f4? Kh5! 3 Kf3 b4! 4 g4+ Kh4! -+. However, White has a most surprising way to win here, namely 2 Ke2!!. There is no particular threat; if it were White to move in the position after this move, his only winning move would be 3 Ke3! - it's zugzwang. The reason why putting the king on e2 wins and the move to d3 only draws, is that it provides a good response to Black's only active plan, ...f6. Here is the proof: a) 2...b4 3 Kd3 f6 4 exf6! Kxf6 5 Kc2! e5 6 Kb3! exd4 7 Kxb4! +-; the vital difference compared to the game continuation is that the king is in the square of the d4-pawn when it takes the b-pawn. b) Retreating the king by 2...Kg7 allows White to play both f4 and g4, denying Black his counterplay. c) 2...Kg5 loses a tempo after 3 Kd3 f6 4 f4+! Kf5 5 g4+ Kg6 6 exf6!. d) 2...f6 3 exf6! Kxf6 4 f4! Kf5 (4...Kg6 5 g4!) 5 Kf3! (this is why the king is better on e2 than d3) 5...b4 6 g4+!

back H.Pillsbury - S.Tarrasch Nuremberg 1896 (See Chapter 8.) The outside candidates will certainly soon achieve their goal. Therefore the decisive question is whether White can support his central pawns in time. It proves to be wise to break through on the kingside by h5:

About Gambit Chess Studio Gambit Chess Studio is an app that enables the purchasing and reading of Gambit chess books in a convenient electronic format. An on-screen board allows the chess content of the book to be viewed, meaning a physical chess set is no longer required. For example, if you have finished playing over a side- variation there is no tedious re-setting of the position - just one tap on the screen restores the main line. Or tap on any chess move in the book, and the position instantly appears on the screen. Once you have bought and downloaded a book via Gambit Chess Studio, it's stored on your device. So it is easy to access your Gambit chess library when travelling, even without an Internet connection. The app itself is free to download from the Apple Store (for iPads and iPhones), or the Google Play Store (Android devices), and a free sample is available for downloading. From within Chess Studio you then select which Gambit books to purchase from the in-app bookstore. Once you've bought a book, you can read it on all your compatible devices. To find Chess Studio in an app store (Google Play or Apple) search for "Gambit Publications" or click on the direct links: Google Play Apple Our Gambit app books page shows which books are currently available for Chess Studio. App titles currently in preparation are included in the Forthcoming Books section. PC users may be able to run Chess Studio by using an Android emulator such as LeapDroid or BlueStacks, though this cannot be guaranteed.

All openings are covered, with detailed verbal explanations of plans for both sides. The first moves of a chess game define the nature of the whole struggle, as both players stake their claim to the critical squares and start to develop their plans. It is essential to play purposefully and to avoid falling into traps or reaching a position that you don't understand. This is not a book that provides masses of variations to memorize. Paul van der Sterren instead offers a wealth of ideas and explanation, together with the basic variations of each and every opening. This knowledge will equip players to succeed in the opening up to good club level, and provide a superb grounding in opening play on which to build a more sophisticated repertoire. The strategies he explains will, unlike ever-changing chess opening theory, remain valid as long as chess is played, and so the time spent studying this book will be rewarded many times over. Also available on Chess Studio. "The format of the book is very friendly, openings very clearly set out and identified, with the variations touched upon in short and sweet sections" - John Lee Shaw, CHESS CHECK (e-zine) Fundamental Chess Endings Karsten Müller and Frank Lamprecht This is the first truly modern one-volume endgame encyclopaedia. It makes full use of endgame tablebases and analytical engines that access these tablebases; where previous authors could only make educated guesses, Müller and Lamprecht have often been able to state the definitive truth, or get much closer to it. Covers all major types of endgame, featuring rules of thumb, thinking methods, principles, practical advice, and much more. Also available on Chess Studio. Also available as German-language Chess Studio and Kindle editions. "The authors love the endgame phase of the game and this shows in the writing. ... Anyone reading it will seriously improve their game." - British Chess Federation Book of the Year Award press release A Cunning Chess Opening Repertoire for White Graham Burgess A good opening repertoire need not require an enormous amount of study to be highly effective. A cunning choice of lines and move-orders can steer the game to positions that we like and deny the opponent his preferred strategies. The main cornerstones of this repertoire are carefully chosen Queen's Gambit lines, the Torre Attack (vs ...e6), and a variety of fianchetto options against the King's Indian and related set-ups. White's position is kept highly flexible, with many possible transpositions to a wide variety of systems that the reader can use to extend and vary the repertoire. The book features a wealth of new ideas and original analysis. Also available on Chess Studio. "This is the way opening books should be written. It is a training repertoire book which you can use to build a solid white repertoire for your career. It is not a 'hope they make a mistake and fall for the trap' book. Best value if you want to learn to play the opening like a grandmaster." - Danny Woodall, Amazon.com review Mastering the Chess Openings Volume 1 John Watson In this major four-volume work, Watson explains not only the ideas and strategies behind specific openings, but also the interconnections of chess openings taken as a whole. By presenting the common threads that underlie opening play, he provides a permanent basis for playing openings of any type. Volume 1 offers both entertainment and challenging study material in king's pawn openings such as the Sicilian and Ruy Lopez. Also available on Chess Studio. Also available as German-language Chess Studio and Kindle editions. "The publication of this series is a bellwether event in chess publishing, and all players should avail themselves of the opportunity to read these books." - Mark Donlan, CHESS HORIZONS "All of these epic Watson works have one thing in common. You walk away after reading with a deeper understanding of chess." - Pete Tamburro, CHESS
LIFE
Mastering the Chess Openings Volume 2 John Watson Watson presents a wide-ranging view of the way in which top-class players really handle the opening, rather than an idealized and simplified model. This volume, focusing on queen's pawn openings, will make chess-players think hard about how they begin their games. It also offers both entertainment and challenging study material in openings such as the Nimzo-Indian, King's Indian and the entire Queen's Gambit complex. Also available on Chess Studio. Also available as German-language Chess Studio and Kindle editions. "Watson has managed to present the most important openings after 1 d4 and analyses them in detail as well as explaining the backgrounds. ... you have the feeling you are holding a real classic in your hand. It may sound exaggerated, but I believe Watson is a sort of modern Aron Nimzowitsch. Absolutely recommended!" - Martin Rieger, WWW.FREECHESS.DE Mastering the Chess Openings Volume 3 John Watson In the third volume of his highly acclaimed series, Watson moves on to flank openings. He provides in-depth coverage of the English Opening, while drawing upon many themes from the first two books. Particularly in the context of reversed and analogous forms of standard structures, we understand why certain ideas work and others don't, and experience the concept of 'Cross-Pollination' at work in even more varied forms than seen in earlier volumes. Also available on Chess Studio. Also available as German-language Chess Studio and Kindle editions. "This volume can be read separate from the other two in this series; however, I recommend reading all three books. They will truly take your game to the next level and help you understand the opening phase so much better, as well as help minimize the risk of starting the game out from an inferior position. Those who play the English Opening should buy this book without any hesitation. This book is a modern classic. It is genuinely instructive and provides numerous examples of original analysis and improvements over existing theory." - Carsten Hansen,

In the process, Watson covers a variety of opening structures and variations not seen in the earlier volumes and presents a great wealth of original analysis. He also explains how players should best prepare and choose their openings for the level at which they play. The final topics are the future of chess openings and the skills that will be most important as chess evolves in the forthcoming decades. Also available on Chess Studio. Also available as German-language Chess Studio and Kindle editions. "The section on gambit play is extremely well done and must reading for any player coming up through the ranks. So too is the following chapter 'Choosing and Preparing Openings' which is pure gold. Watson gives well-considered suggestions for appropriate openings for players from just beyond beginner to 2300 that will solve many amateurs' perennial headache.

Grandmaster Aveskulov presents a sound but ultra-aggressive repertoire based on gambits that have proved their worth in grandmaster play over many years. The Benko Gambit offers Black very active piece-play and intense positional pressure. If White dodges the Benko, we hit him with the Blumenfeld, sacrificing a pawn to set up a strong pawn-centre.

Understanding Pawn Play in Chess Dražen Marović Chess owes its extraordinary depth to pawns. These humble pieces can take on many roles in the chess struggle. They can be blockers, battering-rams, self- sacrificing heroes, and can even be promoted to the ranks of royalty. Marović investigates high-quality games to provide the reader with an armoury of pawn- play concepts that will help him make the right judgements at the board. Also available on Chess Studio. Also available as a German-language Kindle edition. "GM Marović utilizes all his experience as a GM and trainer to outline appropriate strategies associated with specific pawn-structures: isolated pawns (specifically IQP), isolated pawn couples, hanging pawns, passed, doubled and backward pawns, pawn-chains and pawn-islands. This approach ... has of course been attempted before, but not, that I have seen, with such clarity as in this book" - Jonathan Tait, BCCA The Most Amazing Chess Moves of All Time John Emms Very occasionally, a chess move is played that astonishes the whole world. It may be a move of astounding complexity, unearthly beauty, deep paradox... or all three. The move is discussed and analysed around the world as chess-players attempt to fathom both why the move works, and how on earth anyone thought of it in the first place. In this book John Emms has selected, from hundreds of candidates, the 200 most amazing chess moves of all time. In each case, the reader is given the chance to try to find the move for himself - making this one of the most challenging chess puzzle books ever published. Also available on Chess Studio. "...you are getting double value for money - a wonderful games collection and a 'find the continuation' complication. A really enjoyable and instructive book." - Alan Sutton, EN PASSANT A Rock-Solid Chess Opening Repertoire for Black Viacheslav Eingorn Grandmaster Eingorn shows that it is possible both to play solidly, and to take White out of his comfort zone. The repertoire, based on playing 1...e6, is strikingly creative and will appeal to those who want a stress-free life as Black. You will get every chance to demonstrate your chess skills, and are very unlikely to be blown off the board by a sharp prepared line. Eingorn's subtle move-orders are particularly effective if White refuses to pick up the gauntlet, as Black can then use his delay in playing ...Nf6 to good effect and take the fight directly to his opponent. Also available on Chess Studio. "...shows depth of reading and balanced research. ... A pleasure to recommend this little gem of a book. ... Perhaps the best book of 2012 so far. A creative effort." - James Pratt, BRITISH CHESS MAGAZINE Understanding Chess Middlegames John Nunn The middlegame is the phase of the chess battle where most games are decided, yet is the one that has received the least systematic treatment from chess writers.

Also available as German-language Chess Studio and Kindle editions. "...the best book of its type ever published" - Peter Connor, CHESSCOUNTRY.COM "The highly professional design of this book commends it for use in chess lessons for beginners" - Dr W. Schweizer, ROCHADE Grandmaster Secrets: The Caro-Kann Peter Wells The Caro-Kann is one of the most popular responses to 1 e4. Black stakes a claim to the central squares and seeks free development for all his pieces. While solid, it is by no means a drawing weapon - the resulting positions generally contain at least a degree of imbalance and the critical lines lead to sharp positions with chances for both sides. Many new approaches for both sides have been developed in recent years, and a good understanding of these ideas is vital for anyone looking to handle either side of the Caro with success. Also available on Chess Studio. "I would be quick to pick up this book as an e4 player or if I defended it with the Caro-Kann. Wells really focuses on how to play the opening by presenting a wide range of ideas for both sides. Explanations abound ... the analysis and coverage is outstanding." - Lou Mercuri, CHESS HORIZONS Play the Najdorf Sicilian James Rizzitano The Najdorf Sicilian has a unique place amongst chess openings: for several decades it has been regarded by the top grandmasters as the best way for Black to play soundly for a win against 1 e4. James Rizzitano, a battle-hardened Sicilian warrior, distils the most important ideas and themes from current practice to provide an ideal guide for those looking to succeed as White or Black in the Najdorf in the modern scientific era. Also available on Chess Studio. "A good book for those that want to start playing the Najdorf with Black and also recommendable for Najdorf players not the least because it is very much up to date and includes state of the art knowledge about the lines presented. Also quite useful for players that face the Najdorf with White, specially those that play Bg5 or Be3 since so many different lines for Black are analysed here." - Hedinn Steingrimsson, WWW.SCHACH-WELT.DE Play the Alekhine Valentin Bogdanov The Alekhine is arguably the most forcing and aggressive reply to 1 e4. Black immediately forces the pace and drags the game onto his own favoured territory. Those who specialize in the Alekhine find that the opening has a real practical sting and quick-strike potential. The coverage in this book is even-handed, and there are abundant ideas presented to both sides. Also available on Chess Studio. "This is Bogdanov's third book for Gambit, showing that this quality publishing house trusts the author - and why wouldn't they? The language is fluent and informative, and the sample games are well chosen and instructive." - Marko Tauriainen, SUOMEN SHAKKI Chess Explained: The Queen's Gambit Declined James Rizzitano The Queen's Gambit Declined is one of the most important and popular of chess openings. Both sides have ways to create imbalance and test their opponent's skills and knowledge in a full-blooded struggle. In addition to the traditional main lines with Bg5, White has at his disposal the Exchange Variation, and the Bf4 system, both of which can be handled in highly aggressive style if he wishes. Rizzitano covers all these lines and a plethora of other important options, focusing on the fundamental ideas on which they are based. Also available on Chess Studio. "I should also loudly call attention to Rizzitano's new, well-written, and amazingly well-researched Chess Explained: The Queen's Gambit Declined..." - John Watson, THE WEEK IN CHESS Chess Explained: The French Viacheslav Eingorn and Valentin Bogdanov The French appeals to a wide range of chess temperaments: it is solid yet uncompromising, and with a variety of chaotic variations to appeal to the most bloodthirsty of players, but also offering more tranquil lines to those seeking a quieter existence. Chess Explained books provide an understanding of an opening and the middlegames to which it leads, enabling you to find the right moves and plans in your own games. Also available on Chess Studio. "...if you are considering utilizing the French as a weapon against 1 e4, then this book is a very good and inexpensive way of deciding if the opening is for you. It will give you a solid grounding in fundamental positional ideas and typical tactics in the French." - Munroe Morrison, OPEN FILE Chess Explained: The Classical Sicilian Alex Yermolinsky The Classical (1 e4 c5 2 Nf3 d6 3 d4 cxd4 4 Nxd4 Nf6 5 Nc3 Nc6) is one of the most popular and respected systems of the Sicilian. Black develops his pieces more quickly than in many Sicilian systems, and intricate piece-play often results. Yermolinsky covers lines that retain the independent significance of the Classical move-order, such as 6 Bc4 Qb6 - a line in which he is a leading specialist. Also available on Chess Studio. Also available as a German-language Kindle edition. "Yermo's book represents a good way to get to grips with this sound and interesting opening system." - Phil Adams, 3Cs website Chess Explained: The c3 Sicilian Sam Collins The c3 Sicilian is one of White's most popular and poisonous ways to avoid the main lines of the Sicilian. With the forcing line 1 e4 c5 2 c3, White denies his opponent the chance to demonstrate his preparation in some chaotic system. There are plenty of tricks and traps in the c3 Sicilian, and the open piece-play that often results can lead to quick attacks and means that careless play will rarely go unpunished. Also available on Chess Studio. "...the format is well suited to the average club player who wishes to start using this variation." - David Mills, TIME TROUBLE Chess Explained: The Grünfeld Valentin Bogdanov The Grünfeld creates immediate imbalance: Black strikes at White's centre with all available resources. In the main lines, White creates a large pawn-centre and launches an attack. While the theory of these lines has been extensively developed, there is a coherent logical thread that needs to be understood in order to get to grips with the theory and handle the resulting positions. This book features a special contribution from Viacheslav Eingorn on the key ideas of the Rb1 Exchange main line, which he was instrumental in developing. Also available on Chess Studio. "If you like aggression when you play Black then this book is for you. It creates immediate imbalance and again it is crucial to know how to handle this opening as White too." - Carl Portman, DEFENCE FOCUS Chess Explained: The Nimzo-Indian Reinaldo Vera The Nimzo-Indian is one of the most important of all chess openings, and popular at all levels of play. It provides winning chances for both sides as it leads to structures of great strategic variety and complexity. Key battlegrounds in the Nimzo include the blockade, IQP positions, the handling of unbalanced pawn- structures, and the struggle between bishop and knight. An understanding of these topics will prove valuable in a very broad context. Also available on Chess Studio. "This is a very well-written book with enough analytical material to launch your Nimzo-Indian career, and more than enough explanation to justify the series title." - John Watson, THE WEEK IN CHESS Chess Explained: The Queen's Indian Peter Wells The Queen's Indian is an important and popular opening at all levels of play. Black's flexible stance allows him to choose between a range of solid and dynamic structures. In turn, White can play flexibly, opposing Black's fianchetto, or can try to force the pace in the centre and start a hand-to-hand fight. It is an opening rich in nuances, and many of the modern main lines involve moves that look extravagant, but are backed up by a deep underlying logic. Also available on Chess Studio. Also available as a German-language Kindle edition. "The annotations in particular really impressed me, for the author actually did explain what was happening at every stage of the game. Everything appeared logical as I played through the games and read the annotations. Where alternatives are given, you are told why a certain move is good or bad, not just the fact that it is so. Peter Wells is to be congratulated on presenting everything so lucidly." - Alan Sutton, EN PASSANT Chess Explained: The Modern Benoni Zenon Franco The Modern Benoni is one of the few openings where White has no easy way to force drawish simplifications or deny Black any dynamic counterplay. In this book Franco shows how Black can seek to create the kind of mayhem that has attracted champions such as Tal, Kasparov and Topalov to the Benoni, and also demonstrates how White can seek either to put a positional clamp on the game, or else to storm Black's position before his development is complete. A special section deals with the vital question of move-orders. Also available on Chess Studio. "These books provide 25 well annotated, up to date model games which you can use to guide you when learning the openings. Excellent introduction to these openings for intermediate players." - Paul Dunn, AUSTRALIAN CHESS Chess Explained: The Meran Semi-Slav Reinaldo Vera Belying its solid classical appearance, the Semi-Slav is one of Black's most aggressive responses when White opens with the queen's pawn. The Meran is its traditional main line, and often leads to chaotic positions of immense strategic and tactical richness. Vera draws upon decades of personal experience to explain the underlying logic of the Meran and related lines, and to pick out the key features of positions that to the untrained eye might appear random and unfathomable.

Chess Explained: The Main-Line Slav David Vigorito The Main-Line Slav is one of the key battlegrounds of modern chess, with adherents among all levels of chess-players. This book discusses all major lines following the moves 1 d4 d5 2 c4 c6 3 Nf3 Nf6 4 Nc3 dxc4. Vigorito dissects the most important themes and nuances, placing them firmly in the context of the practical struggle, making sure that readers will be familiar with the resources at their disposal, and understand when to employ them.

As an introductory work to the Main-Line Slav, this book is an excellent place to start" - Carsten Hansen, WWW.CHESSCAFE.COM Chess Explained: The English Opening Zenon Franco The English Opening is a flexible and dynamic choice for White, which avoids a great deal of sharp and well-mapped opening theory. It is popular with all levels of chess-players, and has been used to good effect at world championship level by Kasparov, Korchnoi, Botvinnik and other greats of the game. The English gives rise to an immense variety of structures, ranging from reversed Sicilians to Hedgehogs and fluid or locked central structures. Also available on Chess Studio. "Altogether I found this book really helpful in both the white as well as the black side of this opening." - Andy May, WWW.NSGCHESS.COM Nunn's Chess Endings Volume 1 John Nunn Going beyond standard texts, Dr Nunn shows how to apply knowledge of standard endgames to find the right methods in tricky real-life practical situations - even when they differ greatly from the idealized forms given by traditional endgame manuals. Nunn shows that lack of familiarity with key ideas can cause important ideas and themes to be missed even by very strong players. We discover that a staggering amount of previously published endgame analysis is simply wrong, and that many of the standard guidelines are at best partially true. This first volume covers general topics and discusses in detail pawn endings, queen endings and minor-piece endings. Also available on Chess Studio. "I think this really is a fantastic book. ... The book's introduction and the first chapter (The Three Key Endgame Skills) are some of the best endgame-related chess prose I've read in a long time." - Arne Moll, CHESSVIBES.COM Nunn's Chess Endings Volume 2 John Nunn In this award-winning two-volume series, Dr John Nunn identifies new and important motifs which occur repeatedly in over-the-board play. Tactical elements are heavily featured, and the focus is on endgames that are susceptible to concrete analysis. The discussion is geared to the over-the-board player; the ideas underlying the analysis - however complex - are richly explained in words. This second volume focuses on rook endgames - the most common and important category of practical endgames. Nunn also covers endings with rooks and minor pieces, a wide and rich area of strategic endgame play that is universally recognized as vital for chess mastery, but nevertheless neglected in chess literature. Also available on Chess Studio. "The book is in many respects different and better than the majority of the other books on the endgame where often the inspiration of the author languishes after a few chapters. ... the reader undoubtedly takes profit even from a passive or lazy reading: so great is the way the author explains complex positions making them easy and appealing to any range of audience" - Martin Eden, SOLOSCACCHI Garry Kasparov's Greatest Chess Games Volume 1 Igor Stohl Garry Kasparov dominated the chess world for more than twenty years. His dynamism and preparation set an example that is followed by most ambitious players. Igor Stohl has selected 74 of Kasparov's best and most instructive games from 1973 to 1993, and annotated them in detail. The emphasis is on explaining the thoughts behind Kasparov's decisions, and the principles and concepts embodied by his moves. Stohl provides a wealth of fresh insights into these landmark games, together with many new analytical points. This makes the book outstanding study material for all chess enthusiasts. Also available on Chess Studio. Also available as German-language Chess Studio and Kindle editions. "[Stohl] often improves on Kasparov's past comments.

Endgame Challenge John Nunn John Nunn presents 250 challenging positions where your task is to find a cunning way to win or draw. In many cases the odds against success seem overwhelming, yet by using all the tactical resources in the position it is possible to achieve the goal. Nunn's detailed solutions contain many points and clarifications that have hitherto gone unmentioned, so readers will rarely be left to wonder whether their intended solution really did work. In an over-the-board game, the ability to use the pieces in harmony is paramount, and those players who can exploit every resource in a position are those who become champions. While the focus in this book is on tactics, readers will also develop a greater understanding of many important endgame topics, such as fortresses, stalemate defences, the opposition and zugzwang. Also available on Chess Studio. "The first 50 pages contain 250 diagrams to solve, and then we get 250 pages of shocking solutions - shocking in the sense that even world-class players might draw or even resign positions, when beautiful and unlikely possibilities still exist" - Bab Wilders, NEDERLANDS DAGBLAD John Nunn's Chess Course John Nunn Following on from his successful books Understanding Chess Endgames and Understanding Chess Middlegames, John Nunn fleshes out the theory by showing how World Champion Emanuel Lasker handled a wide variety of practical situations. We see how Lasker's play, which his opponents found so unfathomable, was based on logic, extreme pragmatism and a deep understanding of how chess-players think. Nunn covers topics not usually considered, such as queenless middlegames and manoeuvring, and dissects strategic issues including piece-activity, pawn-structure and bishop vs knight. He looks at psychological aspects of chess, such as choosing lines which are most uncomfortable for the opponent. The explanations focus on general ideas rather than detailed analysis. The book concludes with a selection of exercises, with full commentary and explanation. Also available on Chess Studio. Also available as German-language Chess Studio and Kindle editions. "Now and again, amongst the hundreds of new books published, a jewel arrives. ... Choosing to examine chess strategy, tactics, etc., through the medium of the career of one player satisfies two objectives - one, the biographical chess career of a world champion and the other, all techniques necessary to become a proficient chess-player. Nunn succeeds magnificently in achieving this. When I was involved in running a chess stall at congresses, many times I faced the question 'Can you recommend a chess book that I can read?'. Now, I would not struggle to find an answer." - Bill Frost, CHESS DEVON Win with the Stonewall Dutch Sverre Johnsen, Ivar Bern and Simen Agdestein The Stonewall Dutch is a traditional favourite amongst club players, as it offers Black ready-made attacking plans on the kingside. As Bent Larsen noted, the Dutch also has the tendency to 'bring out the coward' in opponents, giving it an added practical sting. However, up until the late 1980s, the Stonewall wasn't fully trusted at grandmaster level, despite its earlier use by Alekhine and Botvinnik. Black's attacking plans were too one-sided, and White's methods too well worked out. The change came when a new generation of players, including Nigel Short and Simen Agdestein, showed that Black could handle his position in many other ways, including play on the queenside and in the centre, with the 'Stonewall' structure stifling White's attempts to generate play of his own. Agdestein in particular has continued to experiment with many new set-ups and move-orders for Black, and this book contains a wealth of new recommendations and suggestions based on this work. Also available on Chess Studio. "An outstanding book ... Not only do the authors rehabilitate an underestimated opening - they even do so by means of inspiring chapters supported by the personal experiences of leading experts." - GM Peter Heine Nielsen,

Secrets of Positional Chess Dražen Marović How can one determine if a piece is weak or strong? Or if a square is weak or strong? These are the principal questions that grandmaster and trainer Dražen Marović addresses in this important book. By discussing carefully-chosen games and positions, Marović explains how to recognize good and bad features of positions, and how to make use of one's advantages and exploit the opponent's weaknesses. Also available on Chess Studio. Also available as a German-language Kindle edition. "As in his previous works, Marović's deep knowledge shines through and he makes welcome use of classics and not just recent games. This work looks at many important positional principles, such as the weakness of the second rank or the use of rooks on half-open files ... the club player who takes time to study its many themes, and hundreds of well-explained examples, should significantly boost the depth of their positional understanding memory bank" - Richard Palliser Secrets of Chess Defence Mihail Marin Good defensive abilities earn players a great many half-points and full-points. The climax of the defence is the launching of a devastating counter-attack, a skill at which all the great chess champions have been adept. Of particular interest to club players is Marin's discussion of how to defend against unsound attacks, and the problem of how to parry the attack while retaining winning chances. Other topics include attack and defence in equal positions, where both sides must judge carefully how much of their resources to devote to the attack and the counter- attack. The main subject, though, is the case where the defender is fighting for his life, and must decide how to maximize his chances of survival. Marin considers psychological issues and explains the main options available to the defender: simplification, cold-blooded defence, a positional sacrifice, 'blackmailing' the attacker, or a counter-attack. "Chess defence is invariably the part of the game that a lot of players don't like to study because they find it too boring or they'd rather attack like Tal. In this his first publication, Mihail has written a book that will change your mind about defence as an important element to the game." - Michael Stevenson, NEW

Secrets of Attacking Chess Mihail Marin What are the premises for a successful attack? Marin discusses the traditional concept that a player with the advantage is obliged to attack, and also the value of notions of logic and justice in deciding whether to attack. If we believe an attack is justified, but cannot back it up with concrete variations, how do we decide whether to trust our intuition? Marin surveys typical attacking scenarios, such an attack on two wings, with a queenside attack as a prelude for a swift strike on the other wing, and all-out attacks against apparently well-defended positions. He also explains why grandmasters generally prefer to maintain as many options as possible, and investigates the role of prophylactic thinking in attacking play. Also available on Chess Studio. "A quick glance at Secrets of Attacking Chess might prove somewhat intimidating. While there is plenty of explanatory prose Marin believes in backing up his conclusions with concrete analysis. A closer look reveals that Marin has a definite pedagogical bent and has taken pains to sprinkle instructive comments throughout the book that are destined to stay with the reader. Highly Recommended." - IM John Donaldson, JEREMYSILMAN.COM Vishy Anand: World Chess Champion Vishy Anand and John Nunn Anand has been one of the world's top players for more than two decades, but it's not just his results that make Anand special. His style of play leads to highly spectacular games, and his speed of thought is the stuff of legends. He is also a great explainer of ideas, as his annotations for this book demonstrate. Anand is renowned as 'Mr Nice Guy', popular with both the public and his fellow supergrandmasters. This new expanded edition of the award-winning Vishy Anand: My Best Games of Chess features 30 extra games from the period of Anand's greatest successes, selected by Anand and annotated by John Nunn, and also contains a biographical sketch and a detailed career record. "This book is full of wonderful games, many of which are tremendously complex, and occasionally the variations run to a considerable depth - neither Anand nor Nunn refrains from showing concrete variations, where the position warrants it. But both offer a nice balance of explanatory annotation as well, so there is a great deal of instructional value in here as well." - GM Luke McShane,

Win with the London System Sverre Johnsen and Vlatko Kovačević The London System is a perennial favourite of club players, as it is a very sound and solid system with a real practical sting. The authors of this new book seek to maximize this sting in two principal ways. Firstly, by explaining in detail the typical plans for White, they help readers to make the most of their chances, whether they are based on a kingside attack, queenside penetration, central play, or transition to a favourable endgame. Secondly, they advocate some subtle move-orders that limit Black's options, and give White possibilities to change the nature of the game and go straight for the kill if Black responds casually or inappropriately. These move-orders have been tested successfully by co-author Kovačević at grandmaster level, and much of the analysis presented here is of totally new variations, and is previously unpublished. Covers all responses to 1 d4 against which White can use the London System. Also available on Chess Studio. Also available as a German-language Kindle edition. "This is a first-class book, extremely well written, about a system that for too long has had its light hidden under a bushel." - Michael Stevenson, NEW

How to Play Chess Endgames Karsten Müller and Wolfgang Pajeken In this companion volume to the award-winning Fundamental Chess Endings, Müller and Pajeken focus on the practical side of playing endgames. They cover all aspects of strategic endgames, with particular emphasis on thinking methods, and ways to create difficulties for opponents over the board. Using hundreds of outstanding examples from modern practice, the authors explain not only how to conduct 'classical' endgame tasks, such as exploiting an extra pawn or more active pieces, but also how to handle the extremely unbalanced endings that often arise from the dynamic openings favoured nowadays. All varieties of endgames are covered, and there are more than 200 exercises for the reader, together with full solutions. Also available on Chess Studio.

He conveys his understanding with great skill" - IM Craig Pritchett, THE HERALD A Strategic Chess Opening Repertoire for White John Watson Such has been the acclaim for John Watson's ground-breaking works on modern chess strategy and his insightful opening books, that it is only natural that he now presents a strategic opening repertoire. The repertoire is based on 1 d4 and 2 c4, following up with methodical play in the centre. Watson uses his vast opening knowledge to pick cunning move-orders and poisonous sequences that will force opponents to think for themselves, providing a true test of chess understanding.

John Nunn's Chess Puzzle Book John Nunn Most chess puzzle books put you in an artificial situation: you are told a combination exists, what the theme is and what you are required to achieve. This one is different. In a real game, a player may sometimes need to find a combination. On the other hand he may have to reject a tactical idea and simply find a good positional move. His task is to find the right move, whatever it may be. The 300 puzzles in this book put you precisely in that situation. Spectacular ideas abound in these positions, but it is for you to decide whether to go in for them, or whether you would be falling into a trap. If you need them, there are hints to help you on your way. The book ends with a series of tests to measure your skills against those of other players. Also available on Chess Studio. "I think puzzle books serve as a great training tool before tournaments, to sharpen up tactics and help players to get into the groove of being able to calculate some lengthy variations. I don't have a great deal of puzzle books but this is clearly the best one on my bookshelf!" - GM Stephen Gordon, 3CS CHESS Secrets of Pawn Endings Karsten Müller and Frank Lamprecht This book provides a thorough course in endings with just kings and pawns, from the simple to the highly complex.

Secrets of Rook Endings John Nunn The first edition of this book ushered in a new era in chess publishing. It was the first book based on computer-generated position databases that are guaranteed to provide the actual result of a position. However, this book is no computer print-out. It takes a human 'oracle' to extract the useful information from this mass of data and to identify new principles to help the rest of us appreciate the key practical points. Dr John Nunn, top-class grandmaster and renowned theoretician, performs this role admirably. He has identified where previous theory has been overturned, and where there are important new results. Dr Nunn was also the first to reveal the general importance of the many 'reciprocal zugzwang' positions. Also available on Chess Studio.

Secrets of Pawnless Endings John Nunn After the success of Secrets of Rook Endings, John Nunn turns his attention towards endgames without pawns. These occur surprisingly often in practice and are extremely tactical in nature. This book unites man and machine in the search for ultimate answers. The computer databases created by Ken Thompson, formerly of Bell Laboratories, can state with certainty the correct result of any position with five pieces or fewer. John Nunn has extracted the most important information from these databases and presented it in the form of guidelines and specific key positions, which can be more readily digested by the human mind. With most competitive games these days being played to a finish in a single session, this knowledge may prove invaluable over the board. This is a new and expanded edition of an important book. Since the first edition was published, the databases for six-man endings have been created, resulting in some surprising and paradoxical discoveries. The coverage has therefore been expanded to include the most interesting features of these endings. Also available on Chess Studio.

It covers Nunn's career from childhood up to 1985 and features 24 of John Nunn's best and most instructive games, including his award-winning 1985 victory over Beliavsky. This superb manual of strategy and tactics also offers advice on how to think at the board and insights into the world of professional chess. Also available on Chess Studio. "A beautifully eloquent and instructive blend of variations and verbal explanations." - INSIDE CHESS John Nunn's Best Games John Nunn Winner of the British Chess Federation Book of the Year Award John Nunn has an unparalleled reputation as a chess theoretician and writer of the highest class. In this book he focuses his attention on his own games and annotates 40 complete games and many game fragments. The book covers the period 1985-93, when Nunn rose to enter the world top 10, and includes victories over Short, Tal, Korchnoi, Anand, Gelfand, Portisch, Judit Polgar and many other top players. The analysis of these games provides a manual of attacking chess from one of the world's best tacticians. This book is far more than a collection of superbly analysed games, however, since the author has brought the games to life with anecdotes from the events, and provides many practical tips which will be of benefit to aspiring chess players of all levels of ability. Also available on Chess Studio. "[Nunn's] combination of erudition and straightforwardness makes him a particularly good subject to emulate. ... Perhaps the high point of this collection is Nunn's 25-move victory over Sokolov of the USSR at the Dubai Olympiad,
1986. Wiping a top Soviet player off the board so unceremoniously was
something that British players simply never did until Nunn and Tony Miles came along." - T.D. Welsh, 'Top 500' Amazon.co.uk reviewer Dynamic Pawn Play in Chess Dražen Marović This book tackles fundamental questions such as: 'How should pawns be used to fight for the centre?' and 'How does the central pawn formation affect planning for both sides?' These issues are central to understanding chess. Marović discusses central pawn-structures and their impact on play both in the centre and on the wings. He begins by surveying how the pawn's role in controlling the centre has been developed over the last 150 years, and how this has led to the refinement of concepts such as the 'dynamic' backward pawn and the positional exchange sacrifice. The bulk of the book is devoted to discussions of the main type of centre: Open Centre; Closed/Blocked Centre; Fixed Centre; and in particular the Mobile/Dynamic Centre. "Marović has obviously been in the company of some of the greatest players and listened carefully to what they had to say ... this book is excellent value and is sure to improve your chess" - Chris Rice, WEEKEND CHESS The Survival Guide to Rook Endings John Emms For all chess-players - from beginners to grandmasters, and whatever their style of play - one thing is certain: rook endings will arise in a great many of their games. Yet it is precisely in this area of the game that many players give away hard-earned points, either through lack of knowledge or inadequate understanding. Most previous books on the subject have been extremely technical and theoretical, but this one is different. John Emms provides the essential specific knowledge and explains the key concepts that will enable readers to find the right plan in most common types of rook endings. Also available on Chess Studio. "If you didn't purchase this book first time around then I think you missed out. Rook endgame knowledge is at the core of endgame theory. Many club players would save a huge amount of points by having the confidence to go into a rook endgame, especially when a pawn or two down." - Munroe Morrison, OPEN FILE The Giant Chess Puzzle Book Zenon Franco More than anything else, a player's ability to find tactical solutions determines how successful he is over-the-board. No endgame scheme, opening idea or strategic plan, however brilliant a concept it may be, is of any value unless it is accurately calculated and implemented. This book provides a wealth of chess puzzles to test just about every facet of your tactical ability. Franco has searched recent events and used powerful computers to seek out previously unpublished puzzles, and has also drawn extensively upon Latin American sources that he has been scouring for brilliant examples over the last three decades. The book begins with 120 relatively easy positions suitable for novices, and ends with 80 extremely tough puzzles, which provide a mind-bending challenge even for grandmasters. There are 1001 puzzles in all, including themed sections and graded tests, all with detailed computer-verified solutions and verbal explanations of the main instructive points. "Most of the positions will not have been seen before in other publications and you will not fail to improve your game - certainly your tactical awareness - if you have the discipline to work through this lovely book. Chess problems are like life. We are given a question and we don't always know the answer. Is it right to turn away and not try to find that answer? Maybe we should just roll up our sleeves and meet that challenge head on; after all the answers are all there, waiting to be found. Enjoy the journey and absorb yourself in just some of the delightful mysteries of the 64 squares." - Carl Portman, DEFENCE FOCUS The Cambridge Springs Krzysztof Panczyk and Jacek Ilczuk The Cambridge Springs is a popular defence to the Queen's Gambit that takes its name from the famous tournament in 1904 during which it was tested in a number of games. Since then it has become firmly established as a club-player's favourite, since Black sets a number of traps and can generate a very quick initiative if White fails to respond precisely. Several world champions have used the Cambridge Springs, most notably Alekhine and Smyslov, while Kasparov has played it on occasion, including a sensationally quick victory over Karpov in
1985. The authors combine thorough research with a wealth of original material
to offer comprehensive coverage of this combative system. While the main body of the book covers both sides of the Cambridge Springs, it also offers Black a repertoire against White's alternative options in the Queen's Gambit, the most important of which is the Exchange Variation. "A professional effort where the authors have made their own contributions and have overturned long-held erroneous conclusions. I'm quite happy giving it 9/10" - GM Glenn Flear, NEW IN CHESS Understanding the King's Indian Mikhail Golubev Despite its sharp and aggressive nature, the King's Indian is an opening that lends itself well to discussion in terms of plans, ideas and pawn-structures. Those who are familiar with these underlying themes will enjoy an enormous practical advantage when facing those who lack this understanding, even if they are theoretically well-prepared. This engaging personal account of the King's Indian is also wide-ranging and detailed. The main games are all from Golubev's own practice, enabling him to provide a completely accurate description of the decisions at the board. The notes contain a wealth of references to games and ideas from other King's Indian specialists, and the coverage is sufficient to provide Black with a flexible and aggressive repertoire. "If you work with this book, you will affirm that the author is with you in the tiniest details, thorough, self-critical, and comprehensively analytical" - E. Carl,

How to Calculate Chess Tactics Valeri Beim Thinking methods are at the heart of the chess struggle, yet most players devote little conscious effort to improving their calculating ability. Much of the previous literature on the subject has presented idealized models that have limited relevance to the hurly-burly of practical chess, or else provide little more than ad hoc suggestions. Here, experienced trainer Valeri Beim strikes a balance by explaining how to use intuition and logic together to solve tactical problems in a methodical way. He also offers advice on when it is best to calculate 'like a machine', and when it is better to rely on intuitive assessment. Also available on Chess Studio. Also available as German-language Chess Studio and Kindle editions. "One of Beim's insights is that, when we find a beautiful combination that fails, we're often halfway to finding the move we should play. The opponent's strength that breaks our attack is precisely the target we should set about undermining. ... Beim shares with us a set of tools that, once mastered, appear well-designed for rapid, effective calculation in the critical positions that separate the master from the amateur." - Derek Grimmell, CHESSCAFE.COM Perfect Your Chess Andrei Volokitin and Vladimir Grabinsky Andrei Volokitin is one of a rare breed of players: he achieved a ranking in the world's top 20 while still a teenager, playing dynamic and often brilliant chess. Although we cannot all aspire to emulate his achievements, there is much that we can learn from his training methods, his games and his general approach to chess. These topics are the subject of this book, written in collaboration with his trainer. The core material of the book is 369 positions where the reader is given a task or asked a question. These tasks resemble those that players regularly face over the board, and are especially useful from a training viewpoint. Many of the positions are from Volokitin's own games, so we get the 'inside story' on some truly spectacular chess. We are also presented with fine examples from Grabinsky's training files, carefully collected and graded over the years for their instructive merit. The commentaries and detailed solutions explain the key issues in each position, and also convey the authors' philosophy of chess and their love for the game. Also available on Chess Studio.

One of the best he said was IM Grabinsky of Lvov and then rattled off a list of teenage IMs and GMs over 2500 on a rapid course toward 2600.

It is based on the training program that Hall himself followed when he was an up-and- coming player. The lessons are not based on 'quick fixes', but instead provide a well-rounded course in all aspects of chess that will equip the reader well for his chessboard battles, and provide a firm yet flexible basis for further improvement. Also available as a German-language Kindle edition. "The examples are great, the pieces of advice even better and the presentation is logical and easy to follow" - BIBLIOTEKSTJÄNST Play the Sicilian Dragon Edward Dearing The Dragon Variation is one of the key battlegrounds of modern chess, and a perennial favourite of ambitious chess-players of all standards. Black develops his pieces so as to maximize the strategic pluses granted him in the Open Sicilian. If White is to expose a defect in the Dragon, it must be by a direct attack, and this leads to ferocious battles, with White trying to checkmate the black king via the h-file, while Black seeks to gain counterplay down the c-file and on the long diagonal. In the Dragon, many Sicilian themes are seen in their clearest form, with the ...Rxc3 exchange sacrifice particularly important. Even Dragon endgames tend to be very sharp, with Black often possessing a swathe of mobile pawns in return for an exchange, a piece, or even a whole rook. In hazardous territory, a guide is essential, and Edward Dearing has stepped up to offer his services. He explains at length the all-important general themes, and advises on how to choose plans and methods, drawing upon his many years of experience and study of the Dragon. Dearing also provides an up-to-date view of Dragon theory, including many new ideas and suggestions to help the reader tailor his Dragon repertoire to suit his own preferences. "This is the new Dragon bible and because of the analysis it will remain essential to every Dragon player for years to come. Gambit's emphasis has always been on quality and depth, thus giving their books a long shelf life. Play the Sicilian Dragon is a great example of this, and also one of the best opening books in recent years." - IM John Watson, THE WEEK IN CHESS Mastering the Najdorf Julen Arizmendi and Javier Moreno The Najdorf is the most popular line of the Sicilian Defence for a very good reason: Black can play for a win without taking undue risks. The Najdorf's fundamental soundness has been confirmed in countless top-level games, and in particular by Garry Kasparov's successful use of it throughout his career. White has tried a wide variety of approaches against the Najdorf, including quiet positional lines and the traditional main line with 6 Bg5. Recently the idea of a rapid kingside pawn advance has found favour. The Najdorf's landscape changes rapidly, and this presents its devotees with a complex task: they must not only keep up-to-date with sharp theoretical lines, but must also have a firm grasp of the strategies that underpin the main systems, both old and new. This book lends a helping hand to those who play the Najdorf or wish to take up this complex opening. Two Najdorf experts from Spain present a flexible repertoire for Black, including a wealth of original analysis of the critical variations. They also explain the key ideas behind the Najdorf, focusing on those plans that are most relevant to modern practice. "If you are interested in taking up the Najdorf, I highly recommend this book if you are looking for a good reference that will let you learn the opening quickly and give you excellent winning chances to boot." - Bill Whited, CHESS COUNTRY The Quickest Chess Victories of All Time (new enlarged edition) Graham Burgess This updated and expanded new edition contains a comprehensive collection of the shortest decisive games in chess history. It is an indispensable guide to the pitfalls and traps that lurk in every opening system. An ability to punish errors in the opening is an essential aspect of modern opening play. The thousands of games featured in this book show how to detect the opponent's errors and take maximum advantage. Studying this book will help you seize your chances to win crisp miniature games, while reducing your chances of suffering an opening catastrophe, and overall will improve the level of your opening and tactical play. An outstanding and comprehensive collection of games won in thirteen moves or fewer. Explanations of the errors made and how to avoid them. Helps sharpen your killer instinct! Also available on Chess Studio. "The notes are excellent. Each chapter has a brief summary of the odds of an opening's difficulty. Transposing move-orders are usually mentioned. Some games have little anecdotes or historical connections. Whenever a game is resigned for less-than-obvious reasons (as most of these are) Burgess explains the mate threat or material loss to us patzers succinctly and precisely. This is really a book of how not to play openings. It will complement any repertoire books and opening encyclopediae. I highly recommend it for your shelf, even to intermediate players (like me). You might find it entertaining. You will find it useful." - C. Dunn, Amazon.com reviewer How to Become a Deadly Chess Tactician David LeMoir A guide for chess-players to help them spot unlikely-looking tactical tricks and launch cunning attacks. Readers are shown how to hunt the enemy king and how to seize the initiative with surprising sacrifices. LeMoir shows that the key factors in becoming a deadly tactician are motivation (having the willingness to sacrifice and to consider tactical ideas during play), imagination (being aware of tactical concepts that lead to ideas which other players might miss) and calculation (being able to analyse and calculate effectively). This user-friendly and humorously written book contains many outstanding examples of seized opportunities, together with guidance on how to spot surprising tactics and handle positions of material imbalance. Throughout, there are exercises for the reader to tackle. Also available on Chess Studio. "LeMoir has selected his chess material extremely well - there are a huge number of startling examples which I'd never seen before - and his comments are always entertaining or instructive" - GM Matthew Sadler, NEW IN CHESS Play the Open Games as Black John Emms This book fills a gaping chasm in chess literature. For years, those who wish to take on the black side of the Ruy Lopez have had to muddle their way through against the variety of alternative openings at White's disposal, as there have been no good books to assist them. Grandmaster John Emms is ideally qualified to deal with this subject. Not only does he face these openings as Black, but he also used to play many of them as White before he graduated to the Lopez. He provides no-nonsense answers to such openings as the King's Gambit, Vienna, Scotch, Four Knights, Italian Game, Bishop's Opening and the variety of oddball gambits White can try. Also available on Chess Studio. "I was also impressed by watching the way Magnus [Carlsen, age 10] read chess books. While the others lay around and relaxed or clowned around in their rooms, Magnus lay in his bed and read Grandmaster John Emms's Play the Open Games as Black, a brilliant book that covers everything but the Ruy Lopez that one can meet when answering 1 e4 with 1...e5. That the book was in English and at a level more suited for top international players did not appear to worry Magnus in the slightest. He didn't need to get out a board and pieces either, he simply read the games from the book without a problem." - GM Simen Agdestein, How Magnus Carlsen Became the Youngest Chess Grandmaster in the World Anti-Sicilians: A Guide for Black Dorian Rogozenko The Sicilian is far and away the most popular chess opening. The reason is obvious: it enables Black to fight for victory without taking excessive risks. The Sicilian scores well in practice and is a firm favourite with players of all standards. Given both the Sicilian's fearsome reputation and the amount of theoretical preparation required to tackle it head-on, many players prefer to side- step the Open Sicilian with one of the Anti-Sicilian systems at White's disposal. These include: positionally motivated lines such as the 2 c3 Sicilian and the 3 Bb5 systems; slow but tricky attacking lines including the Closed Sicilian and the King's Indian Attack; and aggressive but loosening ideas like the Grand Prix Attack and a variety of gambits. This book equips Black to fight against all these lines. In the most critical variations, Rogozenko provides a choice between a solid and an aggressive option. He caters for those who meet 2 Nf3 with the three main moves, 2...d6, 2...e6 and 2...Nc6. Also available on Chess Studio. "To be blunt, any player who plays the Sicilian Defense as Black must have this book" - Chris Chambers, GEORGIA CHESS
50 Essential Chess Lessons
Steve Giddins Steve Giddins has chosen 50 supremely instructive games - some old, some new, and including many that few readers will have seen before. He has annotated these games in detail from a modern perspective, explaining the useful lessons that can be learnt from them, while avoiding the harmful dogma that characterized many older works of this type. Topics include: Attacking the King, Defence, Piece Power, and Endgame Themes. Each game is followed by a recap of the main lessons to be learned. Giddins writes in a highly accessible down-to- earth style that appeals to club players seeking to improve their understanding of practical chess. His knowledge of Russian-language chess literature has enabled him to find many excellent examples that have not appeared in previous western literature. Also available on Chess Studio. "Highly recommended for 1200-2000 players seeking for a game collection, especially those who would like to improve their understanding in middlegame pawn-structures. Giddins tried to update Chernev's Most Instructive Chess Games but he outdid his teacher." - CHESSBUG.COM Instructive Modern Chess Masterpieces Igor Stohl Igor Stohl has selected 62 outstanding games from recent years and analysed them in painstaking depth. Here he presents his findings to chess enthusiasts, who will find the games entertaining and the annotations both instructive and illuminating. Stohl is an outstanding theoretical expert, so the opening phase of each game reads like a lesson in the key strategic aspects of the opening chosen, with a critical survey of modern trends. The middlegame is dissected and the critical decisions subjected to keen scrutiny - we are invited inside Stohl's laboratory to join him in the quest for the truth. The endgame phase, if reached, is handled with similar erudition, with insights into the grandmaster's approach to questions of technique. Following each game there is a discussion of the most important lessons to be learned. The expanded and revised new edition of this award-winning work features 12 new top-level games from the period 2000-7 annotated in great depth - about 40% new material. There are also corrections to the existing notes and a revised Introduction. Also available on Chess Studio. "This is an outstandingly thorough and insightful book. I have greatly enjoyed playing through some of the 50 deeply annotated games and learned a fair amount in the process, including various insights in the opening phase in which Stohl is a renowned expert ... I heartily recommend it" - GM Jonathan Rowson The Gambit Guide to the Torre Attack Graham Burgess An award-winning author provides user-friendly coverage of an opening in which he has a wealth of experience against players of all levels. The Torre Attack is a very attractive system for White as it allows him to set the agenda from the outset, preventing many counterattacking systems. It has quick-strike potential if Black is careless or unfamiliar with the subtleties. The book provides detailed coverage and explanation of the Torre. The main themes are explained, and the critical variations examined in detail. The book focuses squarely on the ideas and systems that are of most relevance to the practical player. The analysis has been checked and revised for this new electronic edition. Also available on Chess Studio. "A couple of books dealing with the Torre came out early in the nineties, but this superb work by Burgess surpasses them. The Torre is a very flexible set-up and gives White good chances of having a pleasant initiative after 1 d4 Nf6 2 Nf3 e6 with 3 Bg5. The Torre will repay careful study and provide interesting chess. The strategic introduction whets the reader's appetite right from the word go as Burgess shows, via 12 illustrative games, just how dangerous the Torre is, and readers will realise that by taking up the opening they will have excellent chances of a quick and decisive attack" - IM Richard Palliser, HULL CHESS CLUB

An Explosive Chess Opening Repertoire for Black Jouni Yrjölä and Jussi Tella This book equips the reader with everything he needs to know to play Black in a game of chess. Two experienced Finnish players have described an exciting repertoire based on the move 1...d6 in reply to whatever White's first move happens to be. Black's strategy is hypermodern and dynamic: White is encouraged to seize space, while Black develops his pieces rapidly and actively, waiting for the ideal moment to attack and destroy White's central bastions. The variations advocated have been proven in top-level play and have quick-strike potential if White is at all careless or imprecise. The repertoire is based around the Pirc Defence and the variations 1 d4 d6 2 c4 e5 and 1 d4 d6 2 Nf3 Bg4, which fit seamlessly together with 1...d6 systems against White's various flank openings. Also available on Chess Studio. "To my pleasant surprise the whole book focused solely on Black's opening move 1...d6. Having dabbled with this a few times myself, I can assure you that the opening is a lot more dazzling than it sounds. The authors appear to have done an extremely diligent job, covering all possibilities for White and, with not far off 300 pages, you get a lot of chess for your money" - GM David Norwood,
WEEKEND TELEGRAPH
How Chess Games are Won and Lost Lars Bo Hansen Traditionally, chess games have been divided into three stages - opening, middlegame and endgame - and general principles presented for how to handle each stage. All chess-players will be well aware that these principles all too frequently fail to help in their selection of the best move. In this important work, Lars Bo Hansen, grandmaster and professional educator, presents chess as a game of five phases, and explains the do's and don'ts in each: the opening; the transition to the early middlegame; the middlegame; strategic endgames; technical endgames. With a wealth of examples from both his own practice and that of his colleagues, Hansen discusses the typical mistakes and pitfalls, and shows how to handle the subtleties unique to each stage. He also gives advice on how to work on your chess in each aspect of the game. Of special value is his explanation of how to study typical middlegames, and that middlegame preparation - a neglected area for most players - is both possible and necessary. Also available on Chess Studio. "Very rarely is so much good advice packed into one book. Hansen considers the lessons to be learned from the way his opening repertoire evolved, pawn structures, advice on swindling, defending, when to seek counterplay, tactics, technical endgames and how to use computers to analyse. This amongst many other ideas. What was particularly impressive to me was the 25 pages of discussion on how to play Queen's Gambit Exchange structures from the point of view of Black and White. Really good stuff. This may be for the advanced player (1800+), but it's a real treasure trove of ideas. It is very rare that one volume can contain such a wide breadth of information over the whole spectrum of chess ideas without sacrificing depth. A true 'desert island' chess book." - Munroe Morrison, OPEN FILE Essential Chess Sacrifices David LeMoir Sacrifices are an essential part of chess. Those who never consider sacrificing will miss countless opportunities and find that promising positions repeatedly slip away. Players who do not appreciate their opponents' sacrificial possibilities will be unable to see danger signs, and find themselves on the wrong end of too many king-hunts. Rather than merely cataloguing the various possibilities and providing examples, LeMoir discusses the possible follow-ups to the sacrifices, the defensive options against them, and the positional factors that might suggest whether the sacrifice will be sound or unsound. There are many important types of chess positions that can only be played well by those who understand the thematic sacrifices that are possible. Also available on Chess Studio. Also available as German-language Chess Studio and Kindle editions. "What makes this book brilliant, is that the concepts and positions examined are part of any top player's fundamental chess knowledge. However, for the average player, below this aura of invincibility, there is no way to gain such an understanding without help from a teacher such as Mr LeMoir. We cannot sift through games, recognize the themes, make numerous case studies, and figure out what factors lead to success, and what factors let you down. David LeMoir has done this for us, and anyone who devotes some time to this book will emerge a better chess-player." - Søren Søgaard, SEAGAARD REVIEWS A Course in Chess Tactics Dejan Bojkov and Vladimir Georgiev The advice frequently given to chess-players eager to improve their results is straightforward: study tactics! But there is often little useful guidance as to how this is best done. By solving puzzle positions? Or endgame studies? By dissecting the games of great tacticians? Few books present a structured approach to tactics, so this book fills a valuable niche in the ambitious player's library. The authors present each major tactical theme in turn, explaining how it works and providing inspiring examples. They then explain how you can spot the idea in your own games and use it to your advantage. You immediately get a chance to put your knowledge to the test, as there are challenging exercises throughout the whole book, with detailed solutions. The second part of the book offers more advanced material, and takes us inside the professional's tactics laboratory. Here we see how tactical themes are combined, and employed to achieve strategic goals. We are also shown how grandmasters spot the targets for their breathtaking combinations, which we thus come to see not as sheer witchcraft, but as the product of disciplined thought and training. Also available on Chess Studio. "The two Bulgarians spend the first part of the book explaining and delineating the elements of tactics (pin, deflection, decoy, discovered attack, etc.) and then move on to some more advanced tactical themes and then top the book off with 40 pages of exercises to reinforce what has been learnt." - John Saunders,

Storming the Barricades Larry Christiansen Many books provide training in how to round off a successful attack with a final combination, but that's really just the easy part. The difficult thing is to decide how and where to attack in the first place, and to build up the offensive without giving the opponent real counterchances. Larry Christiansen is highly respected by his grandmaster colleagues for his ability to conjure up dangerous attacking chances from almost any position. In this book he takes more than 50 real-life positions, breaks each one down into its key elements and explains the right strategy for conducting a successful attack. The examples are selected to illustrate a wide variety of attacking themes and to provide an instructive and accurate picture of how modern players attack and defend. Also available on Chess Studio. "Christiansen reveals what he has studied to become a master tactician ... in contrast to many attacking books, Christiansen gives fresh examples from recent years, organizing them according to attacking principles" - GM Lubosh Kavalek, WASHINGTON POST A Complete Chess Course Antonio Gude This book is a comprehensive manual for those new to chess, which explains with great clarity the basics of the game. Using innovative methods, Gude ensures that readers quickly grasp each key concept before building on it by introducing new ideas. This is an interactive course. With a total of 280 questions and exercises to tackle, the reader will quickly gain skills rather than mere knowledge. Gude strips the mystery away from tactics and combinations by looking first at the strengths and weaknesses of each piece in isolation, and then showing how they work together with each of the other pieces. He also presents guidelines on chess strategy that will help shape the reader's understanding of chess, and a wide variety of patterns for the reader's all- important 'mental database'. The section on openings explains the main aims of each major opening, and the style of game to which they tend of lead, together with some key variations. Later chapters provide examples of how to launch attacks, putting together the skills from earlier chapters, and deal with issues such as chess training, psychology and competitive chess at club and tournament level. Also available on Chess Studio. Antonio Gude is an extremely experienced chess writer and teacher from Spain. Several of his books on tactics and for beginners are long-standing best-sellers in Spanish language. Gude has also translated a great many books, including some of the classics of chess literature. "My fellow teachers at my elementary-middle school have been trying to get a real curriculum for our chess program, and in Gude's book I think we've found it" - Ben George, Houston, Texas Problem Chess: Art and Magic on the Chessboard Göran Forslund This is a book for those who enjoy problem-solving and appreciate clever solutions, and have at least a basic knowledge of chess. It is about the composition and beauty of chess problems: positions forged not in combat but from pure human imagination, and featuring elegant and surprising solutions. The author offers a personal view of chess problems, conveying an infectious zeal for his subject. Because this is as much a collection of short stories as it is a conventional problem collection. No matter how you use the book, you can expect many hours of excitement and a craving for more. Each chapter presents a variety of chess problems of a specific type, ranging from the familiar 'mate in two' puzzles via retro-analytical problems worthy of a whodunit novel to 15- move series problems and the 'outer limits' of fairy problems (altered rules or pieces). Throughout, the creative processes of problem chess are at the forefront of the discussion. Readers are given the opportunity to solve most of the problems before being presented with the solutions. Or you can simply enjoy reading the book from cover to cover without ever needing to set up a chessboard. Also available on Chess Studio. Göran Forslund (1958-2015) was a computer software professional with a PhD in computer science, with a focus on artificial intelligence. He published chess compositions in most genres, and won awards in the World Chess Composition Tournament, and several of his problems were selected for the FIDE albums. He also served as a judge in chess composition contests. He played regular chess too, with some success: he was a finalist in both the Swedish Junior Championship and the Swedish Correspondence Chess Cup. "problem books are usually written for the already initiated. But now an exception has been accomplished by Göran Forslund. ... Forslund introduces each chapter with short texts about, for example, ice hockey, film, childhood memories or Einstein's theory of relativity, and finds relations with chess problems. This makes the book very special and personal, even a little autobiographical." - IM Axel Ornstein, TIDSKRIFT FÖR SCHACK Understanding the Scandinavian Sergey Kasparov The appeal of the Scandinavian Defence is easy to understand: it is very forcing - Black is virtually guaranteed to get his desired structure. There are no annoying 'Anti-Scandinavians' to study! But for many decades the Scandinavian was regarded with some suspicion, as Black apparently loses time recapturing on d5. Modern players have a different view. The great Danish player Bent Larsen kickstarted the revolution with his provocative assertion that it is an improved Caro-Kann (and, not least, beating Karpov with our opening)! But the 21st- century Scandinavian is a different beast altogether; the new main line of the whole opening (3...Qd6) has proven to have great strategic richness, with more than a few tactical tricks lurking just behind the scenes. The Scandinavian has been transformed into an opening that strong grandmasters are willing to use as their main defence, rather than as an occasional surprise weapon. This thoroughly modern guide focuses on these new approaches, while also covering the more traditional main lines. Kasparov guides the reader carefully through each system, explaining his recommendations with wit and clarity. With his help, you will have your opponents wishing there really were some 'Anti- Scandinavian' lines! Also available on Chess Studio. Sergey Kasparov is a grandmaster from Belarus. He plays regularly in international events around the globe and is an experienced writer, with several books and online reports to his credit. "Conclusion: Understanding the Scandinavian is a new addition to the book market and focuses especially on the strategic basis of the Scandinavian Defence. It is both an instruction manual and a guide book, and distinguishes itself particularly by explaining and illustrating as much as possible of what's happening on the board." - Uwe Bekemann, German Correspondence Chess Federation Grandmaster Chess Move by Move John Nunn A collection of John Nunn's best games from 1994 to the present day, annotated in detail in the same style as the best-selling Understanding Chess Move by Move. Throughout, the emphasis is on what the reader can learn from each game, so the book is ideal study material for those seeking to progress to a higher level of chess understanding. There is also entertainment in abundance: Nunn has a direct aggressive style, and many of his opponents in these games are ambitious young grandmasters from the generation inspired by Kasparov's dynamic chess. The book also includes all of John Nunn's compositions - problems and studies - with full solutions. Also available on Chess Studio. "GM John Nunn is at the pinnacle of chess writers and this book shows why. His analysis is always first-rate, and he does a good job of using words, where practical, to explain what's going on. Besides giving you 46 of his most interesting games (complete with detailed notes) played during the last third of his career, he also throws in a slew of chess problems and studies, as well as two interesting articles." - Michael Jeffreys, WWW.CHESSVILLE.COM How to Beat 1 d4 James Rizzitano Rizzitano, author of Understanding Your Chess, presents a full repertoire for Black against 1 d4, based on the Queen's Gambit Accepted (QGA). The QGA is an extremely popular opening amongst players of all levels, as it gives Black free development and counterpunching potential, especially if White takes up the challenge and tries to set up a broad pawn centre. The QGA's soundness is shown by the number of top-class grandmasters who have used it in critical games - it was a key factor in Short's victory over Karpov, and has even been used by Garry Kasparov at world-championship level. Rizzitano has chosen to recommend dependable main lines of the QGA, and throughout emphasizes how Black can create winning chances and White's typical ways to go wrong. The repertoire is completed by a set of weapons against White's alternatives to offering the Queen's Gambit, ranging from the stolid Colle to the weird Hodgson Attack and the reckless Blackmar-Diemer. Also available on Chess Studio. James Rizzitano is a strong international master who dominated chess in the New England region during a 14-year period from 1976 to 1989 - he won 157 out of 336 events in which he competed. His career highlights include victories over Alburt, Benjamin, Benko, Christiansen, Dlugy, I.Gurevich and Wolff, and exciting draws with de Firmian, Larsen, Speelman, and the legendary former world champion Tal. Rizzitano has recently made a return to competitive chess. "Overall, I see no reason not to recommend this book to players from 1200 through at least master level. The analysis is comprehensive, the judgments and evaluations are carefully considered, and a complete repertoire against a major opening move is presented. Highly Recommended." - Lou Mercuri, CHESS

Understanding the Leningrad Dutch Valeri Beim The Leningrad System of the Dutch Defence is an interesting hybrid of the Dutch and the King's Indian. For many years, it was viewed with some suspicion in view of the slight positional weaknesses created in Black's position. However, in the 1980s dynamic new approaches were introduced by such players as Sergei Dolmatov, Evgeny Bareev, Mikhail Gurevich and especially Vladimir Malaniuk. These players showed how an active approach could compensate for these defects, and offer Black excellent winning chances. Since then, the Leningrad has been a popular and effective opening choice for players of all levels. A good understanding of the themes of the Leningrad is at least as important as detailed knowledge of its theory. Valeri Beim has a wealth of experience with the Leningrad Dutch and is an accomplished trainer, so is ideally qualified to guide the reader through the twists and turns of this remarkable opening. Also available on Chess Studio. Valeri Beim is a grandmaster who lives in Austria. He has won numerous tournaments and plays in the Austrian and German leagues. For many years, he was the head trainer at the chess school in Odessa (Ukraine), and he was also the trainer of the Israeli olympiad team. This is his second chess book. "Valeri, as well as being an experienced chess trainer, is a player that uses the Leningrad Dutch Defence himself which is a big plus when writing a chess book. Through nine well-written chapters Valeri covers not only the Leningrad Dutch but also covers what to do if White plays a gambit or tries to deviate early. At the end of the book there is also homework in the form of exercises to do to see how much you've learned. If you wish to learn and understand how to play the Leningrad Dutch then this is the book for you." - Michael Stevenson, NEW

The Ruy Lopez: A Guide for Black Sverre Johnsen and Leif Erlend Johannessen The Ruy Lopez (or Spanish Opening) is one of the critical chess battlegrounds. It has long been recommended as an excellent chess opening for training purposes, as it leads to a wide variety of structures and strategies. This book is a complete guide to handling the black side of the Lopez, based principally around the Zaitsev Variation, upon which Anatoly Karpov relied during much of his career. This line leads to sharp play, often in open battles where Black gains active counterplay and challenges White to seize the initiative on the kingside. The authors explain in detail how Black can weather the storm. They also explain how Black can handle the practical problem of the Ng5 repetition, and recommend reliable procedures against White's other options in the Lopez, starting off with the Exchange Variation, and moving on to a variety of closed systems. Throughout, the emphasis is on what readers actually need to know and understand in order to play the opening successfully in practice. There is a great deal of explanation of important ideas, and the authors take pains to guide their readers away from potential pitfalls. Also available on Chess Studio. Sverre Johnsen is a FIDE-rated player from Norway. He is an enthusiastic chess analyst, researcher and writer, and co-author of Win with the London System one of the most popular openings books of recent years. Leif Johannessen is a young grandmaster, also from Norway. He plays in several national leagues and has represented his country in many team events. The quality of his opening preparation is shown by the fact that he won the prize for most important theoretical novelty in Informator 92. "Good chess opening books are all about 'feel' - do you feel the authors are making you at home in the variation, do you feel they are giving up their 'secrets' to you, the reader, and do you get the feeling they are on your side? Well, this book scores very highly in this respect; take the Preface, for example. It's a 15 page discussion by GM Johannessen on how to learn a chess opening (albeit aimed at the Zaitsev, but the lessons are universal) - and it does the subject matter wonderful justice. I've read magazine and internet articles which do not come close to Johannessen's logical explanation of taking an opening from a thought over a coffee at a chess bookstall to a full part of your tournament repertoire. For my money, the best part of the book, although the rest of the material doesn't lag behind in quality." - Munroe Morrison, OPEN FILE Understanding the Marshall Attack David Vigorito The Marshall Attack is a chess opening like no other. Rather than subjecting himself to the 'Spanish torture' so typical in the Ruy Lopez, Black simply gives away a centre pawn. But in return, he gets long-term attacking chances and activity that can persist well into the endgame. It is almost a century since Frank Marshall invented his sensational gambit, but it is still controversial, and more popular than ever amongst the best players in the world. In their hands, the Marshall Attack looks remarkably solid - even if White neutralizes Black's attacking chances and remains a pawn up, Black often achieves full positional compensation. However, the Marshall appears a forbidding opening to ordinary club players, who feel that the theory is too difficult to understand and much too complex to memorize. Many simply avoid it with both colours. That, argues David Vigorito, is a shame. He shows that many typical Marshall positions can be broken down into elements that we can all grasp, and so build up an intuition to guide us. Then we are able to tackle this incredible opening and develop a feel for why pieces go to the squares that they do, and when Black has sufficient compensation, and when he does not. Of course, the Marshall remains a highly sharp and concrete opening, even to those who are versed in its unique brand of black magic. Vigorito provides detailed, cutting-edge theoretical coverage of all its main lines and the most important Anti-Marshall systems. Also available on Chess Studio. David Vigorito is an International Master from the United States. He plays regularly in high-level competitions, including the US Championship. He has written extensively for a variety of publications and is a chess teacher. This is his second book for Gambit. "a good summary of existing theory, and the author has taken care to track down often overlooked, but sometimes theoretically crucial correspondence games, and importantly there is a decent sized section on Anti-Marshall lines that often crop up in practice." - GM Michael Adams, DAILY TELEGRAPH Understanding Rook Endgames Karsten Müller and Yakov Konoval Endgames with rooks and pawns are the most frequently occurring in chess, arising in about 1 game in 10. If you learn an important technique in this endgame, chances are you will end up using it sooner or later. And there are a great many methods and concepts that can be mastered with a little effort. This book highlights the key themes in rook endings, and at each turn invites the reader to test his knowledge and skills with abundant exercises. Rook endgame theory does not stand still. New practical examples illustrate novel approaches as players seek to pose problems to their opponents - Magnus Carlsen has shown that even the driest-looking positions can feature deadly traps. The ongoing creation of new endgame tablebases - of which co-author Yakov Konoval has been at the forefront - enables new classes of positions to be assessed with definitive certainty. Using six-man and the brand new seven-man tablebases, the authors re-examine many of the old evaluations and reach new and enlightening conclusions about classic rook endings. You will be startled and amazed, and soon discover that you are becoming a far more effective endgame player. Also available on Chess Studio. German grandmaster Karsten Müller is arguably the world's foremost writer on chess endgames. His 'masterwork', Fundamental Chess Endings, is a modern endgame 'bible' and was studied intensively in his youth by current World Champion Magnus Carlsen. Yakov Konoval is a Russian chess-player and programmer who studied at Mikhail Botvinnik's chess school. He has written programs for solving chess problems and has pioneered new techniques for generating endgame tablebases. "Unbelievably well written ... many new discoveries are revealed here. One of the best endgame books of all time" - John Elburg, WWW.CHESSBOOKS.NL "You can feel confident that anything you study and learn on the basis of Müller's book is 100% correct" - GM Matthew Sadler, NEW IN CHESS Chess for Life Matthew Sadler and Natasha Regan
SHORTLISTED FOR THE ECF BOOK OF THE YEAR AWARD
In this thought-provoking, wide-ranging and often inspiring book, the authors examine how chess style and abilities vary with age. The conventional wisdom is that greater experience should compensate for a loss of youthful energy, but with so many of the world elite currently in their twenties, chess is increasingly looking like a young man's game. By making a number of case studies and interviewing players who have stayed strong into their forties, fifties and beyond, the authors show in detail how players can steer their games towards positions where their experience can shine through. Interviewees include: GM John Nunn, GM Yasser Seirawan, GM Nigel Short, GM Judit Polgar, GM Keith Arkell, GM Pia Cramling, FM Terry Chapman, GM Jon Speelman, GM Sergei Tiviakov and WIM Ingrid Lauterbach. By examining so many aspects of chess, the authors have written a work that ends up transcending its subject-matter, and becomes a text on how and why we love chess, the means by which we can play successfully whatever our age and level of play, and how chess is truly a game for life. Also available on Chess Studio. Matthew Sadler is one of the strongest British players of recent decades. Having become a GM in his teens, he twice won the British Championship and was awarded an individual gold medal at the 1996 Olympiad. After concentrating on an IT career for more than a decade, he returned to high-level chess in 2010 and quickly regained a spot in the world top 100. Matthew's struggles to bring his game back up to speed after his long break were part of the inspiration for this book. Natasha Regan is a Women's International Master from England who achieved a degree in mathematics from Cambridge University. While pursuing a successful career as an actuary in the insurance industry, she has raised a family and maintained a strong interest in chess and other board games, including Go. "unlike any other chess book I have seen. It addresses the subject of how to sustain, and seek to improve, one's chess strength throughout life, despite the inevitable diminution of calculation ability. Sadler and Regan have produced an insightful analysis of the way chess players of different styles adapted to age and the advancement of theory. From this, and candid interviews ... they unveil a tour de force of ideas to consider applying to one's own game. This is not a book for the aging - it is rather a testament to the value of experience with lessons for players of all ages" - Ross Jackson, NEW ZEALAND CHESS Fundamental Checkmates Antonio Gude
SHORTLISTED FOR THE ECF BOOK OF THE YEAR AWARD
Chess might seem a complex and mysterious game, but the ultimate goal is simple: checkmate. Checkmate can occur in all stages of the game, from snap mates in the opening, through middlegame attacks to simplified endgames. Learning how to use our pieces together to corner the enemy king is a fundamental skill that all chess-players must constantly practise, sharpen and develop. This book lays out, in systematic and thorough fashion, a wide range of mating patterns and techniques, in particular showing how each piece-pair can combine to deliver mate. A working knowledge of these ideas enables players to move on to mating combinations, where pieces lay down their lives so that the remaining forces can deliver mate. Gude explains an amazing variety of tactical devices, and illustrates them in unforgettable style with some of the most brilliant mating attacks from practice, new and old. There are chapters on how to attack kings in the centre, as well as standard (and other!) attacks against the castled position. This is a true textbook of checkmate; readers will never be short of mating ideas, and will instinctively know when there is a possibility to launch an attack, or when they must parry the opponent's threats. Fundamental Checkmates also features more than 300 exercises with full solutions. Also available on Chess Studio. Antonio Gude is an extremely experienced chess writer and teacher from Spain. Several of his books on tactics and for beginners are long-standing best-sellers in Spanish language. Gude has also translated a great many books, including some of the classics of chess literature. "The number of great examples is overwhelming. On the one part there are classic game fragments you may already know, but also a lot is new, giving something for everyone. I myself am currently using this book as study material for my constant training ... the book is actually suitable for any chess player. High recommended" - IM Dirk Schuh, ROCHADE EUROPA A Simple Chess Opening Repertoire for White Sam Collins By choosing variations that lead to similar structures, highly experienced player, writer and teacher Sam Collins has put together an ideal repertoire for players with limited study time. White opens with 1 e4 and develops his pieces to natural squares and seeks open lines and the initiative. A successful repertoire is more than a set of variations; it also requires strategic understanding of the resulting positions and a knowledge of the key tactical methods and patterns. Because many of Collins's recommendations lead to IQP (Isolated Queen's Pawn) structures, ideas can easily be transplanted from one opening to another. He gives complete illustrative games that emphasize the main themes. The specific analysis is up-to-the-minute and features many new ideas that have proven their worth in recent grandmaster practice. Throughout there is a great deal of attention to move-order subtleties and on finding nuances in 'sidelines' that your opponents are most unlikely to have examined in detail. Also available on Chess Studio. Irish international master Sam Collins won the championship of his home country in 2002 and 2014. He has represented Ireland in numerous Olympiads, winning an individual gold medal at Bled in 2002. He is also an experienced chess teacher who has lectured at the Berkeley Chess School in California. His previous books for Gambit were Chess Explained: The c3 Sicilian and the highly successful general opening work Understanding the Chess Openings. "Sam Collins delivers a small but very well thought out repertoire book for White, based on lines that I have hardly seen before - for example the Italian line: 1 e4 e5 2 Nf3 Nc6 3 Bc4 Bc5 4 c3 Nf6 5 d4 exd4 6 cxd4 Bb4+ 7 Nbd2!?. One of the most interesting repertoire books at this moment!" - John Elburg,

Instructive Chess Miniatures Alper Efe Ataman Warning: this book is not just entertainment. The author wants to teach you a lot about chess and improve the quality of your play! He has selected 53 miniatures from throughout chess history - the earliest are from the 1850s, while the most recent are from grandmaster events just a few months ago! A miniature is a decisive game, won in 25 moves or fewer. Most of these 53 games feature brilliant tactics, attacks on the king, and even a few outrageous king-hunts. In many, the winner had to overcome cunning defensive ploys and inventive counterattacks. But our aim in this book is not just to admire the players' skill, but to learn how we can play like this in our own games. Chess coach Ataman is keenly focused on the instructive points, explaining which features of the position justified the attacks, and what prompted the critical decisions. Where analysis is given, it is restricted to what it would be realistic for a human to work out at the board. But why are miniatures so instructive, especially for younger players? It's because we get to see an idea or plan implemented successfully, in full. Once we understand what players are trying to achieve, we can then appreciate how to oppose these ideas, and the cut-and- thrust typical in modern grandmaster play will make a lot more sense. Also available on Chess Studio. Alper Efe Ataman is a FIDE Master from Turkey. He is a chess publisher, author and an experienced trainer, especially at the scholastic level. "The author has dragged his net wide and rediscovered gems like Freeman- Mednis, New York 1955, played when the future Grandmaster was still a teenager. Instructive Chess Miniatures is a book that will provide plenty of pleasure and instruction at a very reasonable price ... recommended" - IM John Donaldson, USA Team Captain Play the Classical Dutch Simon Williams The Classical Dutch is a flexible opening that often gives Black dynamic attacking chances. In this book, one of its most enthusiastic adherents explains the workings of his favourite opening, and provides Black with a complete repertoire against 1 d4. Few opponents will be ready to take on the Classical Dutch, since it has received little attention in chess literature in recent decades. For an opening that has been played by all-time greats such as Korchnoi, Tal and Larsen, the Classical Dutch's current lack of popularity is puzzling. In this book, Simon Williams shows how Black can obtain counterchances against each of White's main options. He also provides recommendations against all of White's alternative approaches against the Dutch, including a variety of sharp possibilities after 1 d4 f5. Also available on Chess Studio. English grandmaster Simon Williams has gained a reputation for playing daring attacking chess. He represented England in World and European Championships in various age groups, and has been a regular in the British Championship since his early teens. "The author makes a spirited plea for the Dutch. Its key ideas and theory are relatively clear and self-contained, providing a rare opportunity these days to absorb sufficient information to play and experiment confidently without considerable research." - IM Craig Pritchett, THE HERALD The Seven Deadly Chess Sins Jonathan Rowson Everyone loses chess games occasionally, but all too often we lose a game due to moves that, deep down, we knew were flawed. Why do we commit these chess- board sins? Are they the result of general misconceptions about chess and how it should be played? And how can we recognize the warning signs better? In this thought-provoking and entertaining book, Jonathan Rowson investigates, in his inimitable style, the main reasons why chess-players sometimes go horribly astray, focusing on the underlying psychological pitfalls: Thinking (unnecessary or erroneous); Blinking (missing opportunities; lack of resolution); Wanting (too much concern with the result of the game); Materialism (lack of attention to non- material factors); Egoism (insufficient awareness of the opponent and his ideas); Perfectionism (running short of time; trying too hard); Looseness ("losing the plot"; drifting; poor concentration). Also available on Chess Studio. Also available as a German-language Kindle edition. Jonathan Rowson became Scotland's third grandmaster in late 1999, within months of graduating from Oxford University. He was runner-up in the 1997 European Junior Championship, Scottish Champion in 1999 and winner of the Canadian Open in 2000. Rowson's first book, Understanding the Grünfeld, has been highly praised for the quality and originality of his writing, and freshness of approach. "Whenever two large groups argue over a subject so intensely, that subject must be interesting and thought provoking ... The Seven Deadly Chess Sins is a fascinating, original, insightful work by the most promising young chess writer out there. It's well worth owning (in fact, I consider it a must own!), and contains a bounty of knowledge that will improve your game at the cellular level if the Zen gene is a dominant one in you ... Quite simply, The Seven Deadly Chess Sins is one of the best chessbooks to come out in many, many years." - Jeremy Silman, SILMAN REVIEWS The Slav Graham Burgess The Slav has been played by 11 of the first 13 World Champions, and has been favoured by many stars of modern chess, including Anand, Kramnik, Shirov, Ivanchuk and Morozevich. Its great popularity is due to its extreme solidity and abundant possibilities for dynamic counterplay. This book provides detailed coverage to help players as both White and Black face the challenges of this tough yet rewarding opening. All lines after 1 d4 d5 2 c4 c6 are discussed, except those that transpose to the Semi-Slav. The sharpest tactical lines of the Slav receive especially detailed coverage. These include the critical piece sacrifice in the main line (5...Bf5 6 Ne5 e6 7 f3 Bb4 8 e4 Bxe4), the Steiner line (5...Bg4) with 6 Ne5 Bh5 7 h3, and the possibly dubious but highly dangerous Geller Gambit (5 e4), which was a favourite of the young Kasparov. The trendy ...a6 lines are also covered systematically for the first time in chess literature. Also available on Chess Studio. Graham Burgess holds the world record for marathon blitz chess-playing. He is a highly versatile chess writer, whose previous books range from general guides for relatively inexperienced players to high-level theoretical manuals. His Mammoth Book of Chess won the 1997 British Chess Federation Book of the Year Award, while Nunn's Chess Openings, of which he is a co-author, has established itself as the leading modern one-volume openings encyclopaedia. "The Slav continues to remain a very popular opening at all levels and so a thorough survey from the ever diligent Burgess is very welcome. Burgess has meanwhile managed to maintain his reputation as a very conscientious author with this work, as once again he constantly corrects the analysis of others, whilst providing many important suggestions and improvements himself as well as producing clear assessments of lines" - IM Richard Palliser, HULL CHESS CLUB

How to Play Dynamic Chess Valeri Beim Chess is fundamentally a dynamic game. Each move changes the situation and the possibilities for both sides. No piece is ever identically as valuable as any other, and their scope changes from move to move. The current generation of supergrandmasters play unrelentingly dynamic chess, but a great deal of chess literature still deals with chess as if it were a predominantly static game. Much of our understanding of the game is based around traditional rules of thumb that might work well 'on average' or in 'typical' situations. But these rules may not equip us at all well in the specific and sometimes exceptional situations that we face in our games. In this book, Valeri Beim explains how to factor in dynamic considerations, and weigh initiative and time against material and other static factors. This is a realistic account by an experienced trainer and battle-hardened competitor, geared towards the needs of players looking to improve their results. Topics include: Dynamics; Development; The King as a Target; Breakthrough; Initiative. Valeri Beim is a grandmaster who lives in Austria. He has won numerous tournaments and plays in the Austrian and German leagues. For many years he was the head trainer at the chess school in Odessa, and he was also the trainer of the Israeli Olympiad team. This is his fourth chess book. "an incredible work, simply the best I have ever read on this topic. I suspect even some players of the first rank will find something to think about, and the rest of us will have our games adjusted forever. If you buy one chess book this year, this should be it. This book is so good, I have to stray from my usual method of categorizing books, and deem it an Instant Classic." - Don Aldrich,

Improve Your Positional Chess Carsten Hansen Throughout a game of chess, we must constantly make judgements and decisions that cannot be determined simply by calculation. We must then rely on our positional judgement. Good positional skills are primarily developed by experience, but they can also be learnt. In this book, Carsten Hansen provides a wealth of advice and ideas that will help give readers a helping-hand up to new levels of positional understanding. Paramount in this discussion is the player's need to weigh up positional elements at the board, and decide which are most important for the situation at hand. Topics include: The Quest for Weaknesses; What is the Initiative?; Understanding Imbalances; The Relative Value of the Pieces; Decisions Regarding Pawn-Structures; Structural Weaknesses; Where and How to Attack. The book is rounded off with exercises to test your understanding of the concepts discussed, together with full solutions. Carsten Hansen is a FIDE Master from Denmark who currently lives in the USA. He has a reputation for writing well-researched books on major chess topics, and is known to many through his painstaking book reviews on the Internet. This is his fourth book for Gambit.
