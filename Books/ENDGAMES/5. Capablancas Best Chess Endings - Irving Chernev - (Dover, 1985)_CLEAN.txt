The accent is on the ending! The opening of a game is important- and hundreds of books are written on the opening. The opening leads to the midgame. The midgame is important- and hundreds of books are written on the midgame. The midgame leads to the endgame. The endgame is important- and no books are written on the endgame'. Yes, there are books, but they concern themselves with composed endings, or with theoretical (and for the most part artificial! positions. The composed endings are admittedly beautiful, but they are of limited value, as they have no relationship to practical play. Of the theoretical positions, many have their uses, but one must sift the wheat from the chaff. To what use can we put such knowledge as the pro- cedure for mating with a Knight and Bishop, or with the two Bishops, when an opportunity to do so may not occur in a lifetime? And why burden our minds with the manner of forcing mate with three Knights (believe-it-or-not) or winning with four minor pieces against a Queen (sans Pawns) when such positions as these have never yet been seen on land or sea? Capablanca himself says, 'In order to improve your game, you must study the endgame before anything else; for whereas the endings can be studied and mastered by themselves, the middle game and the opening must be studied in relation to the endgame.' There are no books on endings from real life, no books from the practice of masters in actual play, let alone from the practice of a single master. This fact alone is enough to justify this book of endings, selected from the tournament and match play of the greatest endgame virtuoso the world has ever seen-the immortal Capablanca. Here are wondrous endings to enchant the reader, endings of breath- taking artistry. Here are endings of astonishing accuracy, whose relentless logic will inspire the earnest student to emulate a similar technique-the technique of seeking a clear-cut, efficient win, instead of a display of fireworks. The games are given in full, in order to show how a slight advantage, acquired in the early stages, is carried forward and exploited in the endgame. I have annotated the endings in detail (a consideration they have rarely received before) for the better appreciation of the fine points of Capablanca's play, and have given credit to those who have anticipated my findings.

GAME 1
White J. R. Capablanca Black J. Corzo Ninth Match Game, Havana, 1901 Dutch Defence Despite the importance of the occa- sion, this being a match for the Championship of Cuba, the 12-year- old Capablanca breezes through the entire game in phenomenally quick time, taking only 24 minutes for the entire 59 moves, an average of less than half a minute per move! The two players whizz through the opening, skip the midgame, and arrive at the ending in less than 20 moves! The ending is absorbing enough, though, to make up for anything else that is lacking. 1 d2-d4 f7-f5 The Dutch Defence has been favoured by aggressive players, from Morphy to Alekhine. Morphy won two beautiful games from Harrwitz with the Dutch, demonstrating in each of them incidentally his skill in the endgame. Alekhine, needing a win to capture first prize in the Hastings
1922 Tournament, chose the Dutch
as a fighting weapon against Bogolyubov. His faith was not mis- placed, as he won the game in glorious style (the details of which can be found in The Golden Dozen on page 265}. Botvinnik, a connoisseur of this defence, used it in his game against Steiner at Groningen in 1946. He launched an irresistible King-side attack when he obtained the initia- tive, and demolished his opponent in 28 moves. 2 e2-e4 f5xe4

There may be no intent to discon- cert the opponent, but it often gives him a bit of a jolt. Capablanca's games abound i n these clever little zwisch~nzui;gea,nd they offer evidence of the thought I he gave to even the most natural moves before making them.

Although this pretty move ted to a win, Capablanca commented objec- tively that the better move, over- looked by all the analysts, was 26 . . .

Typical is such a reaction as that of Abrahams for example, who said, 'Thus we find Marshall ruining one of the few opportunities given him by Capablanca.'

Strangely enough, Janowsky had Ending 7 remarked at this point, 'This is the only move,' but missed the right continuation afterward. Janowsky's multi purpose move prevents the advance of White's passed Pawn, protects his own Bishop Pawn, and keeps White's Knight on the sidelines, out of the game. If 53 Na4-b2 h3-h2 54 Qc2xh2 Qe4-e1+ 55Kb1-a2 (Bf55Nb2-d1, Qe1xd1+56 Kb1-a2 Qd1-b3+

Janowsky was so intent on this check (the key-move in the two previous variations) that he checks at the wrong square. The right way was to check at hl, whence the Queen could keep a tight surveillance on White's passed Pawn. Janowsky apparently missed the point completely: he analyzed the position (after the game) for two hours, never saw where he made the error, and had to be told by the other masters.
54 Kb1-a2
And now Janowsky has a fourth opportunity to draw by perpetual check! He can do so by 54 . . . Nd3-c1+ 55 Ka2-b1 Nc1-d3+ 56 Kb1-a2 Nd3-c1+, but 54 ... Nd3xe5 ... he does not take it! And with that goes his last chance. 'Before continuing,' says Capa- blanca, 'I should add that the com- ing endgame is perhaps the finest of its kind ever played, and that for some unknown reason it has not been properly appreciated. It is a masterpiece, one of which I am very proud, and which should be care- fully studied.' 55 b6-b7 Ne5-d7

The old adage still holds true, 'If you want to get a draw, play to win!' Rather quiet, the energetic 3 . . . Bf8-b4 is usually preferred.

breaking up the King's shelter of Pawns.

Simple and powerful-the Capa- blanca style.

Both Capablanca and Alekhine were geniuses, but their techniques differed from each other as Bach's differed from Beethoven's. It is we who are fortunate enough to enjoy their wondrous though different creations. Coming back to the game, it is worthy of note that Capablanca says of his last move, 'This is the correct move, after which Black is lost.'

In the event of its exchange, the other Knight is prepared to spring up and take its place at d4. White's Bishop has a grip on the enemy Knight, and this pressure is not easily shaken off. 1n contrast, Black's Knight may not move; his King Bishop is tied down to defending the Knight, and his Queen Bishop is restricted in its movements by the many Pawns occupying squares of the same colour. Capablanca's plan is to exploit these circumstances by increasing the pressure, and thus forcing Black to give up a Pawn or two to obtain a measure of freedom. 19 ...

White H. Fahndrich A. Kaufmann Biack J. R. Capablanca R. Reti Consultation Game, Vienna, 1914 French Defence One move by Capablanca was enough to give Reti a whole lesson in modern chess technique. It was an insight offered by a touch of genius. So startled was Reti by Capa- blanca's refusal even to look at a move that developed a piece, seized an open file, and gained a tempo by driving the Queen off the file, that he was moved to say 'With this game began a revolution in my con- viction as to the wisdom of the old principle, according to which in the opening every move should develop another piece. I studied Capa- blanca's games and recognized that contrary to all the masters of that period, he had for some time ceased to adhere to that principle.' The ending is notable for the nonchalant way in which Capa- blanca gives away Pawns to central- ize his King and activate his Rook.

At the cost of a mere Pawn he has saddled Black with four sad-looking isolated Pawns, while he (White) has an open file for his Rook, and his Queen dominates the center. He is soon disillusioned, though, as Black's Bishop is now beautifully centralized, safe from any fear of being dislodged by Pawns. As for the Pawns-one of them serves to break up White's King-side, while the other three survive to the end of the game, co-operating efficiently to confine the enemy forces.

GAME 20
White J. R. Capablanca Black B. Villegas Exhibition Game, Buenos Aires, Queen's Gambit Declined In the good old days, masters such as Morphy and Anderssen gave away Queens, Rooks, Knights, and Bishops with a lavish hand. These sacrifices were usually unexpected, and their acceptance led to vicious attacks terminating in mate. Defen- sive play was little known, and its practice considered cowardly. In fact the French Defence was called 'King's Pawn one sneak'. Later, when defence became sophisticated (especially with Steinitz, who made it an art) bril- liancies were few and far between, and Queen sacrifices appeared as often in the notes as in the actual game. Take as example this beautiful specimen by Capablanca. There is a Queen sacrifice in the midgame, but it is not made in order to finish the game in a blaze of glory. The Queen is offered almost nonchalantly (so far as Capablanca is concerned, it is a routine move!) in order to gain a positional advantage. And it does gain a positional advantage, whether the Queen is captured or not! 1 d2-d4 d7-d5

Kg8-f8 The King decides t o render what- ever help be can, by moving closer to the center. 27 04-c5 Every step forward i s an important gain for the candidate. 27 ... b6xc5 Anticipating 28 Mxc5 in reply, when 28 . . .

The brilliant touch! Capablanca pre- vents the aforementioned blockade by the enemy Queen at c6, and sets the stage for 29 b4xc5 followed by the further advance of the Pawn to c6. 28 ... Rd8-d5 Protects the Bishop Pawn once again-or so it seems! 29 b4xc5 Capablanca sticks t o his original concept, that of acquiring a passed Pawn and promoting it to a Queen. He is not swayed by the prospect of picking up a couple of Pawns with 29 Qe4xh7 followed by
30 Qh7-h8+ and 31 Qh8xg7,
though that would leave him with a passed Pawn on the King Rook file. 29 ... g7-96 Clearly, 29 . . . Rd5xc5 would IM met (quick as a flash) by 30 Qe4-b4, pinn'ing and winning the impetuous Rook. 30 c5c6 One more step nearer the goal l The King has second thoughts about moving towards the center, as he might s u f p this misadventure:

33. . . Rd5-b5 brings the Pawn to a
dead stop. Page 76 Game 21 34 c6-c7 Black Resigns The Pawn becomes a Queen next move, leaving White a Rook ahead and an easy win. Capablanca's clear-cut play in this ending calls to mind a comment by Sir George Thomas, 'Against Alekhine you never knew what to expect; against Capablanca you knew what to expect, but you couldn't prevent it!' But after the text move (31 a2-a4 1) the Rook could not move to the b5 square! 31 ... Rd5-d6 Now the Pawn seems to be held under lock and key.

GAME 21
White Ed. Lasker Black J. R. Capablanca New York, 1915 Queen's Gambit Declined Capablanca can win a piece for three Pawns early in the game. Characteristically he prefers instead to simplify the position (to his ad- vantage of course). A series of exchanges sweeps the pieces off the board leaving his opponent with a Knight stranded at the side while he (Capablanca) has a Bishop proudly occupying the center. Relinquishing one advantage to secure another, Capablanca forces a final exchange of pieces to leave a pure Pawn ending. As usual, Capa- blanca manages to have only two islands of Pawns against three of Lasker's, and he brings about the win in a delightfully instructive way. Edward Lasker thought so highly of the play in this game as to devote twelve pages on it in his classic book Chess and Checkers: The Way to Mastership. 1 d2-d4 d7-d5

Perhaps, but the King move does it more efficiently, by enabling the King to reach the square c5, where it dominates the position, without loss of time. In short, Capablanca was following his own rule of making the King a powerful piece in the ending. What makes it most impressive, though, is the fact that Capablanca is not content with making a good move, but finds a better one (if there is one) that realizes the same objective, but does it more efficient- ly.

GAME 23
White J. R. Capablanca Black D. Janowsky New York, 1916 Slav Defence Janowsky gets quite a good game from the opening, and his initi- ative persists even after a dubious offer of the exchange. A hasty advance in the center, which should have been preceded by the prophylactic 25 . . . g6-g5, gives Capablanca an opportunity (which he seizes at once) to free his King-side position and take over the direction of the game. In the absorbing ending that follows, Capablanca has a Bishop and two Pawns against a Bishop and Pawn. The task of conducting his passed Pawn to the queening square is delicate, and requires exquisite timing, as the opposing Bishop threatens to sacrifice itself for the Pawn and force a draw. Needless to say, Capablanca displays his usual deadly accuracy in an ending that is a valuable con- tribution to the theory of Bishop- and-Pawn endings. 7 h2-h3 Bg4-h5

White D. Janowsky Black J. R. Capablanca New York, 1916 Slav Defence Capablanca shows his consummate mastery of all styles of play in this game. The subtle strategy initiated by his 10th move could have been a profound concept of Lasker's. PageQ\ Game 24 What a move! This undeveloping of the Bishop is as subtle a piece of strategy as you will ever see on a chessboard! The idea is this: Capa- blanca intends to continue by . . . Nc6-a5, . . . b8-b5, and . . . Na5-c4. The Knight would then occupy an Important outpost and be strongly supported by Pawns. It could not be left there dominating the entire neighborhood, and re- moving it would be practically com- pulsory. The recapture by . . . b5xc4 would undouble the Pawns, and leave Black with the advantage of the two Bishops. In the consequent play. Black could bring a great deal of pressure to bear on his oppon- ent's Queen-side Pawns.

Had Janowsky suspected the pro- fundity of Capablanca's concept, he would not have played a routine developing move, but stationed his Bishop at b5 instead, rendering it difficult to carry out the plan. 11 ... e7-e6 Locking in the Bishop is unimpor- tant, as the Bishop, destined for great deeds, will come to life later.

Had Janowsky suspected the pro- fundity of Capablancs's concept, he would not have played a routine developing move, but stationed his Bishop a t b5 instead, rendering it difficult to carry out the plan. 11 ... e7-88 Locking in the Bishop i s unimpor- tant, as the Bishop, destined for great deeds, will come to life later.

The beautiful central square e5 should be reserved for a piece, and Janowsky should have striven for that possibility by playing instead 21 e4xd5 e6xd5 22 f3-f4 followed by 23 Nd2-f3 and 24 Nf3-e5. Black could then only remove the. strongly-posted Knight at the cost of giving up his dark-squared Bishop for it. 21 ... Bd6-e7 22 f3-f4 If White's object was to place all his pieces and Pawns on black squares, he has succeeded in that ambition! organic weakness which is irremedi- able. A better course was 15 Nf3-d2, waiting (like Mr Micawber) for something to turn up, or the ener- getic 15 Nf3-e5, doing something about it. 15 ... Nc6-a5! The Knight, in accordance with the plan, is headed for c4. White can prevent this by playing
16 Bc3xa5, but he is not anxious to
straighten out Black's Pawns, and as well to leave Black with the two Bishops. (Meanwhile Black, en passant, is threatening 16 . . . Na5-b3, winning the exchange).
16 Nf3-d2 €7-f5!
Capablanca of course will not permit White to free himself by 17 e3-e4, and obtain counter-play. Great players do not let their opponents make good moves. 17 g2-g3 b6-b5! 18 f2-f3 Janowsky misses his last chance to prevent the Knight from coming in at c4, by removing it from circula- tion, but he was loth to part with one of his beloved Bishops. 18 ...

Janowsky Black's positional advantage is two- fold: (a) he has two Bishops against his opponent's Knight and bad Bishop (one whose movements are restric- ted by the many Pawns occupying squares of the same colour), and (b) he has the possibility of opening up lines on both side of the board for his Rooks. Capablanca plans to force a breakthrough on the Queen-side with his b-Pawn, and one on the King-side with his g-Pawn. These two Pawns will be the spearheads of an attack that will enable his Bishops and Rooks to penetrate the enemy position.

Iwon't dwell on his infinite patience in exploiting a minute advantage, or his clever use of xwischenzug, or his fine handling of a Rook ending. What particularlv impresses me is his indifference to Pawn forma- tions that would be regarded with horror by most masters. It was not the ragged look of the Pawns that counted with Capablanca, but the effect they exerted on his oppon- ents's position.

To make up for this, one of his doubled Pawns gets a grip on the critical squares e6 and g6, a grip that turns out to have a decisive effect on the game. The point is that Capablanca's plans are based on positional considerations, and moves that do not fit in with these plans amount to waste of valuable time.

White J. R. Capablanca Black F. D. Yates Hastings, 1919 Buy L6pez Early in the game, Capablanca sacrifices material for position. He gives up a Rook for a Bishop and Pawn, in order to attain mastery of the white squares. Thanks to his beautifully central- ized pieces, Capablanca is able to snip off Pawns almost at will and to acquire two passed Pawns in the middle of the board. Yates fights back (as he always does) but Capablanca, inexorable as Fate itself, will not be denied the victory. The whole game, from 1 e2-e4 to 61 Bf5-e4, is a positional master- piece on a grand scale.

And the smooth, efficient way in which Capablanca does so is worthy of our attention and admir- ation. Simple and strong. The Rubinstein line 4 . . .

White J. R. Capablanca Black A.. G. Conde Hastings, 1919 Buy Lopez Condd, like many other masters, has been lulled into a false sense of security, by what seemed to be smooth sailing. In a Pawn ending, the players have reached an impasse, where Capablanca's King dare not pene- trate enemy territory, and Conde's King (by the laws of chess) may not do so. It is Capablanca who effects a remarkable breakthrough by a sur- prise sacrifice of a Pawn on one side of the board, followed by some exchanges of Pawns on the other. Suddenly, and seemingly out of thin air, two passed Pawns make their appearance-far enough apart from each other to make it imposs- ible for one King alone to hold both of them back. Though most authorities do not recommend the exchange of a strong Bishop for a Knight, Capablanca, who never sought guidance from the books, but followed his own instincts and judgment, selects the move which maintains the initiative. 6 ... b7xc6 7 d2-d4 Again hits the nail on the head.

Capablanca fashions a win from slender material. He obtains a min- ute advantage in the opening, and with a fine sense of continuity carries it through to the midgame and then into the ending. In that stage, his King is closer to the center than that of his oppon- ent, and his Rook is the more active one. This may not seem to be much, but it is enough for Capa- blanca, who fixes his sights on a Pawn, surrounds it, and then removes it from the board.

Capablanca is not hidebound by convention, but is quick to em- brace hyper-modern ideas.

This will involve a series of tortuous Knight moves, all for the sake of getting rid of White's light-squared Bishop. 9 d2-d4 White had two good alternatives here in the quiet 9 d2-d3, and in the conservative 9 h2-h3, which prevents the Knight being pinned, with the consequent pressure on White's center. 9 ... e5xd4 This seems illogical, as it gives up the center, and also enables White (after the recapture 10 c3xd4) to develop his Knight at c3, but there is method to Bogolyubov's madness.

To offset these advantages, White has acquired some of his own: (a) his remaining Bishop is beauti- fully posted on a long diagonal, (b) he exerts pressure on the center, (c) he has good prospects of break- ing up Black's Pawn cluster by a2-a4 at the first available opportun- ity.

The chief drawback to the move is that it weakens the square e6, whereon White might plant a Knight with mighty strong effect.

His Queen, Rook, and Knight are placed aggressively, and enjoy more mobility than do White's pieces, which stand in defensive positions. Biack has a trump too in his passed Pawn, which becomes more danger- ous with every step forward it takes. In White's favour thouc t, is the fact that the enemy Bishop is shut out of the game, which is the equivalent of putting White a piece ahead. Ergo, if White is a piece ahead, he must seize the initiative in order to reap the benefit of this extra force. White's Pawn formation may not be a thing of beauty, but des- pite this handicap, Capablanca, dis- playing his own brand of endgame magic, manages to come up with two connected passed Pawns in the Page 138 Ending 34 Ending 34 Position after 35 . . .

GAME 35
White H. E. Atkins Black J. R. Capablanca London. 1922 Caro-Kann Defence In this little-known masterpiece of Capablanca's, the World Champion heads for the ending almost from the first few moves. The whole game, in fact, might be considered one long endgame-and a magnifi- cent one it is! With infinite patience that over- looks no detail as unimportant, Capablanca's pieces slowly and methodically infiltrate into the enemy territory, and take possession of every good square in sight. Capablanca is inexorable, as usual, and the air of inevitability that permeates this game is perhaps the most fascinating aspect of his style. 1 e2-e4 c7-c6 2 d2-d4 d7-d5 Capablanca adopted the Caro-Kann early in his career, and it stood him in good stead. He used it about a dozen times in tournament play, and never lost a game with it! 3 e4-e5 Unlike the cramping Pawn chain in the French Defence, this formation does not restrict the activity of Black's Queen Bishop. 3 ...

White J. R. Capablanca Black S. G. Tartakover New York, 1924 Dutch Defence Search the annals of chess from the days of Philidor to the reign of Karpov, and you will find no end- ing equal to this for demonstrating the power of a Rook on the seventh rank, it packs in more solid instruc- tion (of the most pleasurable kind, I hasten to add) than the thousand Rook-and-Pawn endings that Capa- blanca is said to have studied in his youth. Alekhine, in The Book of the New York International Chess Tournament of 1924, pays tribute to his great rival's skill with these words, 'A really pleasurable game on the part of the Champion, and a fine example of his machine-like precision and superior technique. White sacrifices material in order to obtain the classical position with King on f6, Pawn on g6, and Rook on h7. Although Dr. Tartakover was two Pawns ahead, he could not Page 145 Game 36 stem the tide. The Pawns tumble like ripe apples.' avoid the variation given above. He trusted his remaining Knight to prove more effective than Capa- blanca's Bishop-but it is the Bishop that turns out to be the superior piece!

White J. R. Capablanca Black Em. Lasker New York, 1924 Slav Defence Capablanca's defeat of Dr. Lasker in one of the most dramatic games ever played between masters of World Championship calibre kept the spectators breathless with sus- pense and excitement. It was a gigantic struggle between Lasker, holder for 27 years of the title of World Champion, hero of a thousand battles, and the greatest fighter ever produced by the game of chess, and Capablanca, the new Champion of the World, whose in- comparable technique and smooth crystal-clear style made chess look like an easy game and not a bitter struggle. It was a notable victory for Capablanca, worthy of the con- testants and the occasion, and earned him a prize for brilliant play. It was the only game lost by Lasker, who was then at the height of his powers, as evidenced by his winning first prize in so strong a tournament. The competition included such outstanding masters (besides Capablanca) as Alekhine, Marshall, Reti, Bogolyubov, Tartak- over, and Maroczy. The ending, conducted by Capa- bianca with classical precision, is in keeping with this great game, and eminently worthy of the masters engaged in its intricacies, un- doubtedly the two finest endgame players of all time. 1 d2-d4 2 c2-c4

GAME 41
White J. R. Capablanca Black M. Vidmar New York, 1927 Ruy Lopez There is a crushing inevitability about Capabfanca's play which makes it seem that the endgame begins with his very first move. As early as the 15th move, Capablanca spies a weakness that he can pounce on in Vidmar's a-Pawn, which has been induced to advance two squares. So, with all the pieces still on the board, Capablanca sacrifices a Knight (temporarily) in a combin- ation to simplify the position and bring it to an ending. His advantage is almost infini- tesimal, but as Euwe says, 'Whether this advantage is decisive or not does not interest Capablanca. He simply wins the ending!

In the sixth round, Capablanca toys with Marshall in the ending, in a bit of cat-and-mouse play. In the twelfth round, Capa- blanca disposes of Spielmann in classic style, in a game of such attractive elegance as to have it awarded the First Brilliancy Prize. In the thirteenth round, Capa- blanca exploits a positional ad- vantage so gradually against Vidmar, that his opponent hardly feels the pain of losing (see Game 41).

The plot begins to reveal itself. The Knight is on its way to f5, there to force an exchange of Knights. Meanwhile, Black's Rooks will occupy the c-file, one of them settling down at c4, where it can menace the Pawns along White's fourth rank.
25 Re2-d2
Alekhine's comment on this move is somewhat cryptic: 'Much better practical drawing chances were offered in this continuation:
25 Nd4xc6 Qb6xc6! 26 Rd3-d4
(but not 26 Qe3xa7 b7-b6
27 Qa7-a6 Re8-a8 etc.) whereby
the opponent is punished to a certain extent for the inaccuracy of his 22nd move. In any case, with best play, he should still win.' Question: how is he punished if he still wins? 25 ... Re8-c8

The Knight seems headed for a strong post at c4, but as that would block the action of his Rooks on the file, Capablanca decides two moves later to bring the Knight back to greener pastures on the King-side. Meanwhile, the Knight's excur- sion might provoke a new weak- ness and Black can afford the loss of a couple of moves if it doesn't.

Alekhine World Championship, 29th Match Game, Buenos Aires, 1927 Cambridge Springs Defence Capablanca won the third and seventh games of this match in blazing, combinative style- quite in the manner of his great rival, Alekhine. But this game is pure, genuine, authentic Capablanca-the kind of game that only Capablanca could produce. Capablanca applied pressure right from the start of the game. Alekhine was left with a lone, isolated Pawn on the Queen-side, and this Pawn fell on the 28th move. After a great deal of com- plex maneuvering, a position was reached where Alekhine had Bishop and three Pawns against Capablanca's Knight and four Pawns. Capablanca was in his element, and handled the ending in his customary elegant style. His Knight dances about, preparing the way for the advance of his passed Pawn. Meanwhile, Alekhine's King is forced further and further back, until it can retreat no more. Capablanca wins the ending as though he were demonstrating an endgame study.

White J. Merenyi Black J. R. Capablanca Budapest, 1928 Sicilian Defence In a quite original opening, Capablanca prepares to fianchetto his King Bishop at the second move. Strangely enough, the Bishop never does get to g7 in the eighteen moves of its life. Capablanca' s King, sensing that he is destined to have an important role in the ending, starts out on his journey as soon as the Queens have disappeared from the board. Faced with a decision at the critical stage of the game, Capa- blanca cuts the Caissian Knot with one swift stroke of his Rook, just as Alexander of Macedon cut the Gordian Knot with one swift stroke of his sword. 1 e2-e4 c7-c5

White E. Canal Black J. R. Capablanca Budapest, 1929 Queen's Indian Defence Canal surprises Capablanca by a combination that wins two pieces for a Rook. Or was it a surprise- something overlooked by Capa- blanca in his nonchalance? Judging by the subsequent play, Capablanca had apparently antici- pated the combination and, looking further into the position than Canal, saw resources that were not revealed to his opponent. The endgame that follows is a fascinating study, and illustrates a 'domination' theme rarely found in actual play. There is a Pawn to be queened, but it would take an eagle eye to find the particular Pawn that wilt be crowned.

This is the position: Position after 40 Bc4d3 Voila! In no time at all Black has whipped up a threat of obtaining a passed Pawn by continuing with 41 . . . Rh2-g2 42 93-94 Ending 48 h5-h4, and the Pawn i s on i t s way to glory. Will the h-Pawn be the one that becomes a Queen?

This may look strange, since it compels the Pawn to move up the board.

Page 219 Ending 49 presages the creation of a passed Pawn. Capablanca plans to increase the pressure on the C-file by doubling Rmks on the file. He also intends to utilize the circumstance that his opponent's white squares are weak to insinuate his pieces with decisive effect into the enemy's territory, availing himself particular1y of the square c4, on which three of his pieces concentrate their power. This looks attractive, as it builds u p an impressive Pawn center. Such Pawn centers may bear within them the seeds of their own des'truction, and zhat they may be peculiarly vulnerable to attack was graphicalty demonstrated by Alekhine, when he introduced a new concept, the Alekhine Defence, into tournament practice in 1921.

GAME 51
White J. R. Capablanca Black F. D. Yates Hastings, 1930 Queen's Gambit Declined Rook endings are important, as they are the ones that occur most often in the game of chess. One can recognize the touch of a master in the way Capablanca handles Rook endings. They are delicate affairs in which the work of hours may be ruined by one hasty move. I believe that a proper study of the fine points of such magnificent Rook endings of Capablanca's as the one against Duras in 1913 (Game 15), the one against Tartak- over in 1924 (Game 36), and the one that follows against Yates, will go far to improve a player's strength. The difficulties are heightened when the Pawns are all on one side of the board.

Capablanca Black F. D. Yates Hastings, 1930 Queen's Gambit Declined Rook endings are important, as they are the ones that occur most often in the game of chess. One can recognize the touch of a master in the way Capablanca handles Rook endings. They are delicate affairs in which the work of hours may be ruined by one hasty move. I believe that a groper study of the fine points of such magnificent Rook endings of Capablanca's as the one against Duras in 1973 (Game 15). the one against Tartak- over in 1924 [Game 361,a nd the one that follows against Yates, will go far to improve a player's strength. The difficulties are heightened when the Pawns are all on one side of the board.

There was still time for 39 . . . h7-h5. 40 g3-g4! But this prevents it once and for all! 40 ... h7-h6 This may be the cause of his loss, though the authorities are divided here. Had Yates played otherwise and lost, the critics might have said, 'Why not 40 . . . h7-h6 at this point?' Kashdan, in the American Chess Bulletin, says, 'This natural-looking move is bad in this position, and is probably the cause of his loss. White will eventually play h3-h4, h4-h5, and h5xg6. If Black recap- tures with the Pawn, he allows a passed King Pawn, or if, as in the game, with the King, the remaining Pawns are isolated. With the Pawn still at h7. White's h4-h5 would involve no threat, and if he ever played g4-g5, then . . . h7-h6 could come, and the exchange of Pawns could lead to a book draw.' Reuben Fine in Basic Chess Endings views it thus, 'This move is not necessary to prevent g4-g5, since it could always be played then. But it does come in handy against the advance of the enemy Rook Pawn, e.g., if Black plays passively. White may play h3-h4, h4-h5, Kf3-g3, f2-f4, Kg3-f3, and finally Ra5-a7, threatening e3-e4, e4-e5, f4-f5, and h5-h6+. In that event, . . . h7-h6 at some future date would certainly be forced.'

GAME 52
White V. Menchik Black J. R. Capablanca Hastings, 1931 Queen's Indian Defence Nothing exciting seems to happen in this game, yet it is a joy to play through. In it we see an interesting aspect of Capablanca's wondrous technique-his inimitable flair for extracting an advantage from the most routine of procedures. For example, Miss Menchik tries to force a draw by exchanging as many pieces as possible. Far from avoiding these attempts to simplify the game, Capablanca welcomes the exchanges, and emerges from each of them with a slightly superior position. By the time most of the pieces have been cleared away, his posi- tional advantage is strong enough to yield a Pawn. One extra Pawn is all Capa- blanca needs, and since he had an incomparable faculty for making all endings look easy, it is a treat to watch him win this one. Preferable was 7 Nb1-d2, bring- ing another piece into play, or 7 e3-e4, releasing the dark-squared Bishop. 7 ... d7-d6

Black has benefited by the ex- change, as White's Knight has dis- appeared, but Black's Knight has been replaced by another piece. Black already has two pieces in play against one of White's (though admittedly the latter has castled). The Art of Exchanging Unwisely was known as far back as the Morphy era. Take as instance the first few moves of the famous game Morphy against the Duke of Brunswick and the Count Isouard, which went as follows: 1 e2-e4 e7-e6 2 Ng1-f3 d7-d6 3d2-d4Bc8-g4 4 d4xe5 Bg4xf3 5 Qd1xf3 (Black's Bishop has disappeared from the board, while White's Knight has been re- placed by another piece) 5 . . . d6xe5 6 Bf1-c4, and Morphy, with two pieces in the field against none of Black's, already threatens mate!

'The King, a purely defensive piece during the opening and middle- game,' says Capablanca himself, 'very often becomes an offensive piece In the ending. In endings of one or two minor pieces, the King should generally be marched for- ward towards the center of the board. In King-and-Pawn endings, almost invariably so.'

This complies of course with the principle that Pawns should not occupy squares of the same colour as the Bishop, as then they restrict the Bishop's range of activity. Note that White's Bishop is ham- pered in its movemenu by the fact that the square e5 is occupied by a Pawn. This principle of endgame strategy governs all cases, except for the 23rd match game between Capablanca and Marshall (see Game 4}. There Marshall complied with this convention, while Capa- blanca disregarded it-but Capa- blanca nevertheless won the game! (It pays to be a genius!)

This pretty Pawn sacri- fice interferes with the action of White's Rook and Bishop at the f3 square. if 37 Bg2xf3, the Bishop occu- pies f3 and prevents the Rook's return to that square. Black would then continue by 37 . . . Ra8-b8 and 38 . . . Rb8-b2, winning the a-Pawn and the game, e.g., if after 37 . . . Ra8-b8 38 Bf3-d1 Rb8-b2

This is augmented Queen-side minority of Pawns splits Page 24 1 Game 54 up Capablanca's Pawns, rendering them vulnerable to attack. Unfortunately for Lissitzin though, he loses the thread of the game, and misses his chance for glory. He lets Capablanca escape from the toils) The ensuing endgame finds Capablanca in his element. Hand- ling it with his usual cool efficiency, he centralizes his Queen, so that her attack radiates in three directions at once. The task of protecting three Pawns is too much for Lissitzin, who is gradually drawn into a semi- zugzwang position, and into an inevitable exchange of Queens- which is fatal.

GAME 55
White J. R. Capablanca Black A. Lilienthal Moscow, 1936 Reti's Opening Capablanca handles the Reti in a way that would have delighted the originator himself, even unto the placing of his Queen in the lower left corner of the board, the move that startled the natives when Reti first played it in 1924. Capablanca whips up an attack on the Queen-side. In the course of it, his Knight takes up a strong post at a5, only to sacrifice himself for the sake of securing a different advantage- the penetration of a Rook to the seventh and eighth ranks. This all-powerful Rook cuts down every Pawn in sight. Curiously enough, after all the activity which nets Capablanca two passed Pawns on the Queen-side, the decision is brought about by the threat of a Pawn queening on the King-side!

GAME 55
White J. R. Capablanca Black A. Liiienthal Moscow, 1936 Reti's Opening Capablanca handles the Rdti in a way that would have delighted the originator himself, even unto the placing of his Queen in the lower left corner of the board, the move that startled the natives when Reti first played it in 1924. Capablanca whips up an attack on the Queen-side. In the course of it, his Knight takes up a strong post at a5, only to sacrifice himself for the sake of securing a different advantage-the penetration of a Rook to the seventh and eighth ranks. This all-powerful Rook cuts down every Pawn in sight. Curiously enough, after all the activity which nets Capablanca two passed Pawns on the Queen-side, the decision is brought about by the threat of a Pawn queening on the King-side!

Both Capablanca's Rooks, in fact; leap gaily over the board, in the ending that is quickly reached, with the grace and abandon of adagio dancers. The entire ending is replete with absorbing play, and is one of the finest endings in the entire literature of chess. The whole game itself was selec ted as the best game of the tourna- ment. This perfectly good opening is so rarefy played nowadays, that i t is not even mentioned in some of the recent opening books. But opinions change. and the Vienna may yet come into vogue, as did the Tarrasch Defence to the Queen's Gambit. And after all, didn't Kann (Capa- blanca's opponent in this game) beat Botvinnik in 26 moves with a Vienna one year earlier a t Moscow? 2 ... B f 8 - ~ 5

'White has a respectable position,' says Euwe, 'thanks to his two Bishops and his center Pawn,which ensure for him a little more terrain. Black's task is now, above all, to prevent his opponent's posting his pieces aggressively, and Capa- b)anca i s just rhe man for this.' 9 ... Bc8-d7

17 Bb5-e2 Ne5-f3+ 18 Be2xf3
Ra5xg5, and the threat of 19 . . . Ng6-h4 assures Black of good winning chances in the ending.
14 Nd4xc6
Not best, though understandable, in view of the fact that exchanges clear the board and allow more scope to the Bishops. (Little did Kann reckon that he was in for a hard Rook-ending with nary a Bishop in sight!) Capablanca himself suggested
14 Bg5-c1, defending the a-Pawn,
so that 14 . . . Ra8-a4 could be met by 15b2-b3 followed by 16a3-a4. 14 ... b7xc6 Now we see what Capablanca is getting at! An earlier exchange by . . . Ne5xd3 would have left Bishops of opposite colour, and good drawing chances, whereas this exchange of Bishop for Bishop removes that possibility.

Capablanca Consultation Game, Leningrad, 1936 Queen's Indian Defence In this, as in many of his games, Capablanca seems to be toying with his opponents, winning in just about any way he pleases. It calls to mind what Lodewijk Prins once wrote: 'For a lover of chess it was a real delight to see Capablanca play. Playing over his brilliant games, one would hardly believe that this man would sit at the board as if some comedy were being performed before his eyes, and would seize any opportunity to rise and walk around with a smile on his face. It is remarkable how accurately Capa- blanca's combinations are calcu- lated. Twist and turn as you will, test all the possibilities, and in- evitably you come to the conclu- sion that everything has been taken into account with the utmost care and precision.' Indian (over the King's Indian) as a defence to the Queen's Pawn Open- ing, playing it twenty-nine times in his tournament and match career, with the result that he won twenty games, drew seven, and lost two (to Sultan Khan and Euwe).

White J. R. Capablanca Black S. Reshevsky Nottingham, 1936 Queen's Gambit Accepted Reshevsky seizes the initiative early in the game, and throws Capablanca on the defence. It takes skill and patience to equalize, but Capablanca has a plentiful supply of both, and is not easily overwhelmed. The position levels out, but gradually he gains a whisper of an advantage, and lures Reshevsky into an ending of Knight against Bishop. The ending is played exquisitely by Capablanca, whose agile, high- stepping Knight dances rings around the bewildered Bishop.

M i t e J. R. Capablanca Black S. Reshwsky Mottingham, 1936 Queen's Gambit ~ccepkd Reshevsky seizes the initiative early in the game, and throws Capablanca m the defence. It takes skill and patience to equalize, but Capablanca has a plentiful supply of both, and is not easily overwhelmed. The position levels out, but graduaHy Re gains a whisper of an advantage, and lures Reshevsky into an ending of Knight against Bishop. The ending is played exquisitely by Capablanca, whose agile, high- stepping Knight dances rings around the bewildered Bishop. 1 d2-d4 d7-d5

His Knight, a stronger piece in this position than the Bishop, can occupy such important squares as d4, c5, and b4, without fear of being driven off by the Bishop, whose influence is restricted to the white squares. The Bishop, on the other hand, is not only restrained in its move- ments by the two weak isolated Pawns at d5 and b5, but has the thankless task of protecting them from capture. Capablanca's initial procedure is simple enough. He forces an ex- change of Rooks (to clarify the position) and maneuvers his King and Knight to dominating squares, and then acquires a passed Pawn. Complications present them- selves when his ingenious opponent Capablanca welcomes the exchange of Queens on his terms, which include keeping the Bishop con- fined behind the d-Pawn.

Capablanca's initial procedure is simple enough. He forces an ex- change of Rooks (to clarify the position) and maneuvers his King and Knight to dominating squares, and then acquires a passed Pawn. Complications present them- selves when his ingenious opponent Page 277 Ending 60 creates a passed Pawn of his own.

Reshevsky is always dangerous, and puts up a hard fight in positions that appear hopeless. Here he begins a dangerous counter-attack that offers good chances of succeeding. Passive play would let White bring his Knight to b4 and his King to d4, after which he could exploit Black's two weaknesses, the Pawns at d5 and b5, with relative ease. Black could have embarked on another course (instead of the line he chose, beginning with 37 . . . g7-g5) with no better result though, as Fine indicates in his book Basic Chess Endings, thus: 37 . . .
