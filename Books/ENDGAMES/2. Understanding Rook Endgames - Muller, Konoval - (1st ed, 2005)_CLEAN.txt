Introduction There are good reasons why it makes sense to study rook endings in detail. They occur more often in practical play than other types of endgame, and they contain a lot of concrete positions that are well worth knowing. Consequently, there already is a rich literature on rook endings. Why add an- other book to this collection? Computer technology is ad vancing and moves endgame theory forward. Co-author Yakov Kono- val and Marc Bourzuischky have created seven-man tablebases and so the definitive verdict on all such positions and optimal lines are known for certain; now seven-man Lomonosov tablebases are available online. While this raw data makes it easy to look up the result of any seven-man position, it is hard to gain much human understanding in this way. Marc and Yakov have developed additional software which provides much more interesting information such as longest wins, zugzwangs, typi- cal positions and so on. Thanks to this software there are many new insights that we present in this book. The book follows a dual philosophy. Chapter 4 deals with the seven-man endings in detail, sorted by pawn configuration. They are often so deep that pre-tablebase analysis almost always contains mistakes. Many new discoveries are revealed here. Chapters 1-3 contain the five-man and six-man endings that a club or tournament player should know. But to really understand rook endings, these theoretical positions are not enough on their own. In addition to giving a mass of practical examples, exercises and guidelines throughout the theoretical sections, we have added chapters on the principles of rook endings, histoiic games and double-rook endings. Finally we want to thank Gambit for their good cooperation, Graham Burgess for editing, Petra Nunn for typesetting, and John Nunn for his foreword.

Karsten Muller and Yakov Konov al February 2016 Foreword by John Nunn Advances in science and technology have often been viewed with concern and even fear. Organ transplantation and in-vitro fertilization were initially highly controversial, but after a remarkably short time these techniques have become regarded as standard. It can't be proved, but 1 suspect that the invention of the wheel and the taming of fire provoked a similar negative reaction. In chess, the appearance of endgame tablebases and playing engines stronger than any human player triggered dire predictions about 'the end of chess', but chess lives on. Today, nobody would consider doing serious opening preparation without the use of an engine, and similarly endgame analysis without the use of tablebases is almost unthinkable. Each new generation of tablebases has led to unexpected discoveries. Even the very first four-man tablebases showed, for example, that winning W vs 2 was much harder than had been supposed. The five-man tablebases revealed that, contrary to almost all endgame books, the end- ing of 2& vs €) was generally won. Six-man tablebases encroached on many endings of practical importance, especially that of H+A vs S+A, but for me the most unexpected discovery was that the ending of W+gA-t-hA vs W was generally drawn. Now that seven-man tablebases exist for all endings of practical importance, one can expect not only new revelations, but also corrections and refinements to existing theory. However, there is one problem which already cropped up with five-man endings. Tablebases may provide an infallible or- acle, but distilling anything useful from huge quantities of raw data is far from easy. My three books based around the five-man tablebases (Secrets of Rook Endings, Secrets of Pawnless Endings and Secrets of Minor-Piece Endings) provided a first insight into how tablebases could be inter- preted by a human author, and the next generation has carried on the work to more complex end- ings. The book you are reading represents the current pinnacle of efforts to interpret tablebases and use them to provide practical chess-improving advice. Although there is coverage of several other materia! balances, this book focuses largely on the seven-man ending which is probably of greatest practical importance, H+2A vs 5+A. It's an ending which arises frequently in practice, and is difficult enough that even the very top players make mis- takes handling it (see Rublevsky-Kasparov on page 168, for example). The authors' systematic ex- ploration of this ending, based on a large number of practical examples, will benefit all players. Just as an example of the type of principle which can be easily remembered and is of real benefit, take a look at Istratescu-Bancod on page 129. If you didn't already know the correct defensive plan of giving up the h-pawn and keeping the king on f7, it would be almost impossible to work it out over-the-board. Another tricky point arises in S. Cvetkovic-V. Kovacevid on page 150. It appears that Black's rook is ideally posted behind the a-pawn, and it is hard to imagine that his first move al- ready threw away the draw. The plan of playing ...2e2, threatening ...Ke5-a5, is very hard to see. White has nothing better than to push his a-pawn, but then, paradoxically, Black's rook returns to its original post. The point is that provided Black prevents White from playing h5 (with his rook on f5), the white rook no longer has a secure spot and can be harassed by Black's king. The creation (or elimination) of a stable square for the attacker's rook is an important general principle, which is vividly illuminated by this example. There is similar practical advice to be found throughout the book; it may not be the easiest read, but anyone prepared to put in some effort will leant a great deal about rook endings. The large num- ber of exercises, some fairly straightforward but some really challenging, are an added bonus and will give the reader the chance to try out his (or her) new knowledge.

8 UNDERSTANDING ROOK ENDGAMES
There is also light relief and some positions of no practical importance are, nevertheless, abso- lutely amazing to see. Take a look at position 4.17.04 on page 218, for example. Black's a~pawn is about to promote with check, so every white move needs to be a check, but who would guess that it takes 94 consecutive checks (without a capture) to finish Black off? The apparently endless checks seem to go round and round in circles without any apparent progress being made, but suddenly it's all over and Black is mated. In summary. Understanding Rook Endgames is a genuinely valuable contribution to the litera- ture on rook endings, pushing back the theoretical boundaries while remaining rooted in the practi- cal game.

1 Rook and Pawn vs Rook
This chapter is relatively short and concentrates on the knowledge a club player really must have, and which will be most useful when studying the later chapters of this book. It contains several of the most important positions in the whole of endgame theory. If you don't already know them well, you should study them carefully. Readers who want to delve more deeply into the mysteries of S+A vs S are referred to John Nunn's Secrets of Rook Endings. J . 1: A Centre, Bishop's or Knight's Pawn 1 1

There are various scenarios: 1 ) If the defending king is cut off by two files then the attacker wins, provided the pawn is not a knight's pawn (and, of course, not a rook's pawn - they will be dealt with in Section 1 .2). 2) If the defending king is cut off by one file, the position is usually drawn, as long as the defending king is well placed.

2 Rook and Two Pawns vs Rook
In this chapter and the next, we examine the two most important six-man endings with rooks and pawns. These are not only important in their own right, but a knowledge of them will be vital back- ground knowledge when we come to study the seven-man endgame in Chapter 4. As you would expect, with H+2& vs B the attacker usually has good winning chances. In our sta- tistics 72% of the games are decisive (and the defender should not win too many games here of course). The main exceptions are h- and f-pawns and two rook's pawns, where schematic drawing set-ups exist, and these configurations occur often in practice. With e+h pawns, it is surpi ising that only 61 % of the games- are won, so we take a closer look there as well. As the six-man tablebases are still relatively new, older endgame texts were unable to give au- thoritative assessments for many H+2& vs B positions. One modern text that also dives very deeply into this ocean is Nunn's Chess Endings Volume 2.

2. 2.2. 2) The Drawing Defence
The defender's rook should usually be near the corner that is furthest away, so that it can give checks from behind and from the side. But the difficult question for the defender is where to put the king. There are two schools of thought here. One favours in front of the rook's pawn and the other in front of the bishop's pawn. The problem here is that the attacker can force this latter decision in several cases. So it is better to master both set-ups; overall we feel that the de- fence with the king in front of the bishop's pawn might be slightly preferable. First we shall show some examples where the attacker can force this decision:

3. Rook and Pawn vs Rook and' Pawn
This is another important ending whose mysteries were finally unravelled with the construction of six-man tablebases. Again we shall focus on the most important points for practical players, and those positions that will be most relevant with respect to our study of the seven-man ending 2+2A vs S+-A in the next chapter. As races often force the defender to give up his rook for the attacker's pawn, it makes sense first of all to review briefly the theory of 2 vs A.
3.1: Rook vs Pawn 48
3.2: Rook and Pawn vs Rook and Pawn 52
3. 1) Rook vs Pawn
Despite the large material superiority of the rook, the defender often has drawing chances. There are many motifs worth knowing: 1) Defence by stalemate with a knight's pawn on its seventh rank or by underpromotion to a knight if it is not a rook's pawn. A knight usually draws against a rook, as long as it is not too far separated from its king. 2) Cutting off the defending king is a strong weapon at the rook's disposal. It often proves decisive if Black's king is cut off along its fourth rank by White's rook (see 3.02). 3) Zwischenschach (in-between check) is another typical weapon of the rook. 4) Bodycheck is by far the most important motif.

The idea of such tablebases is that for a certain combination of pieces, for example vs 'tfc'+K, it's possible to generate a com- plete list that contains the evaluation of every concrete position with this material - win in n moves, loss in m moves, draw, impossible posi- tion.

tablebases with'current hardware, and that the task would have to wait until 2010 or later. Nevertheless, by the beginning of 2005, the American scientist and programmer Marc Bour- zutschky had constructed the first seven-man tablebase - 4Q vs Q (this ending was studied by Troitsky - interestingly, his evaluation of a win for the four knights has proved to be cor- rect). Also by this moment a programmer from Russia, co-author Yakov Konoval, had written a program for the fast generation of six-man tablebases with economical use of resources, so that it could be run on an ordinary home com- puter. The international collaboration between Marc and Yakov for the creation and the analysis of seven-man tablebases started in mid-2005. Ya- kov developed the generator, and Marc worked on the program to verify the constructed table- bases (it guarantees almost absolute correct- ness of tablebases) and a number of utilities to extract information from tablebases. At the present time, work on the generator and the program for verifying tablebases is finished. These tools are highly efficient and nothing else - apart from computing power and time - is needed to construct all seven- man tablebases. Many important tablebases have been constructed by Marc on his home computers (from time to time he gets new computers of course) since 2005. The time to calculate a single seven-man tablebase varies from several hours to one month, and the size of each tablebase ranges from 1 to 150 gigabytes. Our tablebases use the measurement DTC - distance to conversion (i.e. capture and/or pro- motion of a pawn), unlike Nalimov tablebases, which use DTM - distance to mate. You may also come across tablebases that use DTZ - dis- tance to zero, meaning the number of moves before the fifty-move 'clock' is set to zero by a capture or a pawn move. Basically the measurement type is a second- ary consideration - a win is a win, however it is measured. Using DTM will highlight the move that forces mate most quickly, but this may not be the quickest or most natural way to win in practice, as most games do not get played out all the way to mate. For example, if vs is reached, the opponent will most likely resign. Co-author Karsten Miiller believes that the DTM metric, is often easier for human under- standing as in the DTC metric there might be deeply hidden wins after the first conversion into, e.g., a resulting six-man ending. But of course both metrics can have their advantages in certain specific positions:
1 e7 is the normal human move and best ac-
cording to the DTC metric. 1 cb, which is shortest in the DTM metric, looks odd to the human eye. The next position is mate in two and conver- sion in one:
1 Hgl is DTM-optimal and the human move.
1 Qg7+ is odd, but DTC-optimal.
Like in Nalimov tablebases, in our table- bases the en passant capture is considered, but castling possibilities are not. Also we do not consider the 50-move role - see below.

At the outset, we faced an important decision about the method of construction. When mak- ing tablebases, it is possible to include pawn promotion to the full range of pieces, or to re- strict it to, e.g., queen and knight. The latter op- tion makes the process faster in endings such as H+2A vs E+A, as there is less need to construct additional tablebases (with bishops and extra rooks). Naturally, if you limit the range of promo- tions there is no absolute guarantee of accuracy of results, but in at least 99.99% of cases, it is enough to consider only promotion to queen and knight. Generally speaking, the only objec- tivereason to underpromote to a bishop or rook is to avoid stalemate, a very rare (though not impossible) event in this ending given that the defender still has at least a rook and a pawn. On the other hand, the only reason not to construct tablebases with all promotions is to reduce the time taken and the disk space re- quired. All six-man tablebases constructed by us, and used in this book, take into account all promotions. Here is a good example of the importance of the knight promotion: tablebases that didn't consider promotions to a knight, the result for this ending would have been reported incorrectly.

of six-man and' five-man endings, including even vs In these situations the 50- move rule, in Yakov Konoval's opinion, re- quires modification; otherwise it disrupts the logic of the chess struggle. In chess composi- tion, this rule it is not taken into consideration at all. Karsten Muller thinks that for human over-the-board play, the 50-move rule should remain unchanged, as humans do not play per- fectly and if the defender has managed to sur- vive 50 moves then a draw is deserved. Two interesting results wereachieved by us in 2009, albeit of limited direct significance to over-the-board play. The first of them was the construction of several eight-man tablebases without pawns in which one of the sides has two dark-squared and two light-squared bish- ops. The most interesting of them is the table- base 4$. vs 2M. It has appeared that generally the four bishops win, and more than 50 moves are needed to win. The second result is the usage of the idea about restricted promotions for finding posi- tions in which two underpromotions into differ- ent pieces are needed to win. This approach was suggested by the well-laiown mathemati- cian and chess composer Noam Elides and was implemented by Marc and Yakov. Thus the computer acts in a role of a composer of end- game studies; the human needs only to analyse the positions found and to decide whether they are suitable studies, and if desired to add addi- tional moves. In fact, two such studies 'by computer' have already been published and ac- cording to experts in chess composition (Oleg Pervakov and others) they are of good quality. In 2012 a team from the Moscow State Uni- versity (Vladimir Makhnychev and Viktor Za- kharov) constructed seven-man tablebases using the supercomputer Lomonosov in the DTM format. Now their tablebases are available on- line (for some payment) and it's possible to ver- ify online any seven-man position (except six pieces vs lone king), but in our book we use a lot of utilitiesdevelopedby Marc Bourzutschky and Yakov Konoval which allow us to find many interesting positions automatically from various tablebases.

of six-man and ' five-man endings, including even W+2 vs Q. In these situations the 50- move rule, in Yakov Konoval's opinion, re- quires modification; otherwise it disrupts the logic of the chess struggle. In chess composi- tion, this rule it is not taken into consideration at all, Karsten Muller thinks that for human over-the-board play, the 50-move rule should remain unchanged, as humans do not play per- fectly and if the defender has managed to sur- vive 50 moves then a draw is deserved. Two interesting results were'achieved by us in 2009, albeit of limited direct significance to over-the-board play. The first of them was the construction of several eight-man tablebases without pawns in which one of the sides has two dark-squared and two light-squared bish- ops. The most interesting of them is the table- base 4A vs 2H It has appeared that generally Che four bishops win, and more than 50 moves are needed to win. The second result is the usage of the idea about restricted promotions for finding posi- tions in which two underpromotions into differ- ent pieces are needed to win. This approach was suggested by the well-laiown mathemati- cian and chess composer Noam Elides and was implemented by Marc and Yakov. Thus the computer acts in a role of a composer of end- game studies; the human needs only to analyse the positions found and to decide whether they are suitable studies, and if desired to add addi- tional moves. In fact, two such studies 'by computer' have already been published and ac- cording to experts in chess composition (Oleg Pervakov and others) they are of good quality. In 2012 a team from the Moscow State Uni- versity (Vladimir Makhnychev and Viktor Za- kharov) constructed seven-man tablebases using the supercomputer Lomonosov in the DTM format. Now their tablebases are available on- line (for some payment) and it's possible to ver- ify online any seven-man position (except six pieces vs lone king), but in our book we use a lot of utilities developed by Marc Bourzutschky and Yakov Konoval which allow us to find many interesting positions automatically from various tablebases.

The specific configurations are examined in detail in each section. The table on the preceding page shows the overall statistics from practice for each section. T\vo conclusions from this table: 1) The stronger side has the best winning chances with two connected passed pawns vs one passed pawn - about 70%. 2) For doubled pawns, the winning chances are about 33%. More detailed conclusions will be drawn in each section. The table below shows the ten most common configurations in practice. As one would expect, the most frequently occurring configurations don't feature central pawns. Note that these statistics include the mirror configurations (e.g., the figures for 'ab vs a' include gh vs h).
4.3) IMQ Passed Pawns and
Pawns Connected According to our statistics, 45% of the games are won, so there is a drawish tendency, but the attacker can still harbour some hopes. The statis- tics should be reliable here as the single pawn is not passed and so the materially superior side should not lose many games.

With the e-pawn on its fourth rank, the de- fending rook should be on its third rank, to pre- vent the enemy rook from using this rank (see following diagram):

Matters are similar to the previous section, but as a rule the defender has to beeven more careful as the plan of invading with the attacking king on the open long side is more dangerous as it is one file shorter (and thus less checking distance). We start with a typical drawing configuration:

4.15) Longest Wins
For the ending E+2A vs B+A, the maximal length of win in the DTC metric is 79 moves. There are six different pawn configurations with wins in at least 70 moves. We give one position for each configuration. In these 'longest win' sections, 'I!' marks a unique winning move and *!' signifies the only move with the minimum DTC value, but not the only move to win. See next diagram.

4.15) Longest Wins
For the ending E+2A vs E+A, the maximal length of win in the DTC metric is 79 moves. There are six different pawn configurations with wins in at least 70 moves. We give one position for each configuration. In these 'longest win' sections, '!!' marks a unique winning move and *!* signifies the only move with the minimum DTC value* butnot the only move to win.

6.1) Four Pawns against Three on
One Wing Usually endgame books recommend the pawn set-up f7-g6-h5 for the defender, but f5-g6-h5 and even f6-g7-h6 are also good, as long as the defender knows how to hold them, as the at- tacker must exchange pawns in order to attempt to break through.

7 Historic Games
Such a selection is always difficult. We used as our criteria historical significance(so a world champi- onship game is preferred to a casual game), educational value, whether the game has appeared as an example in many textbooks, and if possible rich play in a seven-man ending. Nevertheless the selec- tion is subjective of course. Further historically important games contained in this book are:
2.20: Gligoric-Smyslov - a very instructive example of how to defend S vs H+h+f that is given
in many textbooks.
2.24: Gelfand-Anand - a rapid game that in a way decided the world championship match in
Anand's favour.
2.26: Carlsen-Ivanchuk, after which Carlsen's qualification for the world championship match
was briefly in doubt.
2.29: Fischer-Geller, as losses by Bobby were big news in those days.
E2.14: Kasparov-Short, where both players missed a draw for Short in their world championship game.
3.22 and 5.04: John-Alekhine - a very famous example of the '4th phase' of the game.
E3.21: Gashimov-Stellwagen - Azerbaijan won the European team championship due to this win.
4.7.05: Marshall-Capablanca - this famous classic is in many endgame manuals.
4.7.44 and4.8.05; Lasker-Steinitz- two deep and difficult endgames from the world champion-
ship.
4.11.04 and 5.07: Kramnik-Grishchuk - 5O...2Sd61! is a good example that the rook is a bad
blockader and should be activated.
5.06: Flohr-Vidmar - a very instructive demonstration that the defending rook should be acti-
vated. The above list is not really complete of course. In this chapter we proceed in chronological order and start early in the development of endgame theory.

As in single-rook endings, activity is still very important. But there are of course new questions, such as a rook exchange into a sin- gle-rook ending:
