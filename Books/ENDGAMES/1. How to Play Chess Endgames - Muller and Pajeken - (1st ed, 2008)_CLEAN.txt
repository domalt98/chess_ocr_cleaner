A) 20 Golden Rules of the Endgame 281 B) Rules of Thumb 281 Solutions to the Exercises 284 Bibliography 345 Index 347 Foreword by John Nunn In these days of computer-assisted preparation, opening work has become a fairly mechanical pro- cess. You sit down with a database and a strong engine, and you just work your way through your repertoire one line at a time. The main limitations are the time you have available and your memory capacity. Additionally, there is a huge literature available on the openings, which enables players of all standards to rapidly acquire a good knowledge of virtually any line. In open tournaments, it is not unusual to see masters and grandmasters discomfited by much lower rated opponents who have sprung a piece of opening preparation on their unsuspecting opponents. Mastery of the endgame is another matter entirely. To be sure, there is some memory work in- volved and a knowledge of basic positions is an essential prerequisite for endgame proficiency, but the amount of information which needs to be memorized is much smaller than that involved in opening preparation. A far more important factor is to have a 'feel' for the endgame. It has been truly said that the endgame is the part of chess which most clearly distinguishes the master from the amateur, but why should this be? Certainly natural skill plays a part, and the great endgame players of the past, such as Rubinstein, Capablanca and Smyslov, clearly had an exceptional talent for this part of the game. A second factor is that many players devote relatively little attention to the endgame. They long for a quick kill and spend hour after hour studying openings, ignoring the endgame more or less completely. Memorizing a few innovations in the opening may seem more exciting than learning how to win a rook ending with an extra pawn, but the latter will earn more points in the long run. Finally, we come to the important point that endgame literature is very sparse compared to that devoted to opening theory. If you have the talent of Capablanca, you probably don't need a book to tell you how to play endings, but for the rest of us some guidance is a great assistance and can help avoid many painful lessons over the board. Just as some opening books offer a detailed coverage of an opening, while others focus more on plans and ideas, so the same distinction can be made with endgame books. The majority of endgame books adopt an encyclopaedic approach, offering a co mprehensive coverage of some part of endgame theory or, if the authors are ambitious, the whole of endgame theory. Fundamental Chess Endings by Karsten Muller and Frank Lamprecht (Gam- bit, 2001) is a good example of this genre. I must admit to liking this type of book, and I have written three myself in the encyclopaedic style. However, the second type of endgame book is just as important; the type that explains how to play the endings, and tries to help develop that all-important but elusive 'feel' for the endgame. This book fills a gap in endgame literature by offering a systematic point-by-point overview of the general methods of endgame play. There are a lot of misconceptions about endgame play. Per- haps fuelled by stories of how players such as Capablanca just 'knew' where to put their pieces, there is a general feeling that endgame play is mainly about intuition and that calculation plays a relatively small part. This is far from the truth. Capablanca clearly had a good feel for the best squares for his pieces, but you can bet that he did plenty of calculation as well. Tactics play as im- portant a role in the endgame as in the rest of the game. Mating attacks may be less common in the endgame than in the middlegame, but in the endgame there are tactical ideas which rarely occur in other phases of the game, such as promotion combinations and zugzwang. Thus endgame play is a mixture of strategy and tactics, with some similarities to the rest of the game but also possessing distinctive features. Getting the tactics right is often a critical matter, as while a middlegame position
FOREWORD 9
may be assessed as 'slightly better for White' or 'clearly better for Black', endgame positions can often be evaluated in more definite terms as 'win', 'draw' or 'loss'. Moreover, if something goes mildly wrong in the middlegame, there may still be a chance to play yourself back into the game, but in an endgame this rarely happens; the first mistake in an endgame may very well be the last. Reading this book brought home to me the close connection between the endgame and other parts of chess. Many of the topics discussed, such as the bishop-pair (see Chapter 9) and the preven- tion of counterplay (see Chapter 8) are also relevant in the middlegame and in fact these topics are often more easily explained in an endgame situation, where the key points are not obscured by ex- traneous details. Thus the study of the endgame not only benefits your play in that part of the game, but promotes better general chess understanding in all phases of chess. If you want to improve your endgame play, you can't do better than start with this book since Muller and Pajeken deal with every aspect of endgame play, strategic, tactical and psychological. After that, look at the classic games of the great endgame players; you may see them in a new light. Go back over your own endgames, especially where you feel that you may have given away a point or half-point, seeking to understand where you went wrong. Finally, view the endgame with more confidence in your future games. With the background gained from this book, the endgame should be something to be embraced rather than feared. John Nunn Chertsey, November 2007 Authors' Preface Many endgame books deal mainly with theoretical endings. These are for the most part categorized according to the material balance and feature endings with very little material which have been analysed to a finish. Of course it is essential for ambitious players on the way to chess mastery to familiarize them- selves with the most important of these positions. But the number of positions to be learnt pre- cisely. by heart, is not so huge. Many of these endings arise so infrequently in practice that from a practical viewpoint it is just not worth cluttering the limited storage capacity of the human brain with their complex and lengthy analysis. In many cases, all that the tournament player needs is knowledge of the possible result with correct play and familiarity with the correct methods and plans for handling such positions successfully. But if merely studying theoretical endings ceases at a certain point to bring you any measurable progress in your chess, what do you then need to improve your endgame play significantly, or even achieve mastery in this discipline? We have tried to provide an answer with this book! Just as in the other phases of a game of chess, in the endgame there are special principles and guidelines which not only make it easier to adapt one's play to the requirements of the situation on the board, but can sometimes also enable you to work out the right way to proceed. Practically every chess-player is familiar with the most important principles of the opening - themes such as rapid development, occupation of the centre, or protecting the king by castling at the right moment. Most players have also heard of such important middlegame themes as the im- portance of the seizure of open files, the control of weak squares or the weakness of a backward pawn. However, the principles of endgame play are generally much less well known. Are you aware, for instance, that themes such as the right exchange and prophylactic thinking are fundamental components of successful strategy in the endgame? Do you know when you can defend an endgame purely passively by means of a fortress, or when, on the other hand, you must sacrifice one or more pawns in order to conduct a defence based on the greatest possible activity? Do you know that in many endgames the ideas of mate and stalemate play an important role? Do you know which are the endgames where you should not rush and which are the endgames where it is vital to act dynamically in a fight for the initiative? Do you know how to saddle your opponent with weaknesses and then take advantage of them? Do you know that the ideas of zugzwang and domination are particularly important in the endgame? Do you know that the bishop-pair is a powerful weapon in the endgame and do you know how to handle it? Are you familiar with all the important rules of thumb of endgame play? Do you know what is meant by thinking in schemes in the endgame? Are you familiar with all the principles of the art of pawn play? Do you know which are the typical mistakes that continually crop up in endgames, and how to avoid them? Do you know which rules you must follow in converting an advantage? If you answered 'no' to any of these questions, then you are definitely holding the right book. Each of the words or phrases printed in bold in the above questions is actually a chapter heading (or part of one) in this book. But even if you answered 'yes' to most or all of the questions, you should still definitely not cast this book aside. You will find in this book not only positions with simple, elementary demands but also positions of the highest degree of difficulty.
AUTHORS' PREFACE 11
In this book we have set out to systematize all known endgame principles and all the fundamen- tal strategic endgame ideas and to explain their essential importance for successful endgame play. For each of these themes we have analysed many practical examples of different types of ending and provided them with detailed annotations and rules to remember. Also, in every chapter we give you the chance to test and consolidate your (newly acquired) knowledge by means of training exer- cises. Despite our taking great care and scrupulously checking our analysis with the help of the latest computer programs, it is inevitable in such a large work that there will be some mistakes. We thank you in advance for any corrections, suggestions and improvements. At this point we should like to thank all those who have contributed to the production of this book. Our special thanks go to Rustem Dautov and Claus Dieter Meyer, who made their analyses available to us; Hanon W. Russell of ChessCafe.com for allowing us to use analyses from 'End- game Comer', ChessBase, without whose programs such a project would be hardly practicable, and last but not least John Nunn and Graham Burgess of Gambit for their patience and exemplary cooperation. We very much hope that you will derive as much pleasure from reading this book as we did in writing it, and we wish you good luck and the greatest possible chess success from your study of endgame strategy. Karsten Muller, Wolfgang Pajeken Hamburg, November 2007 Introduction Before we plunge into the wonderful world of endgame strategy, we should like to give you some hints on how to use this book. We have endeavoured to structure each chapter in the best and most systematic fashion. Never- theless, the theme of this book is so complex that it is hard to avoid some overlap between sections. So, for instance, the topic of 'exchanging the last pawn' might be found not only under 'The Right Exchange' (Chapter 4), but also under 'The Art of Defence' (Chapter 16) and withabit of imagina- tion even in 'The Art of Pawn Play' (Chapter 2). If you do not find a topic where you would expect it, then please consult the contents list. The more you work independently on your game, the more your chess will improve. We recom- mend therefore that you conscientiously study all the examples provided in this book. You should first of all set up the positions in each section on a chess board and then attentively play through at least the main variations printed in bold. In connection with this, you should try to solve the train- ing exercises independently, also sitting calmly at a chessboard. In each case, look up the answer only when you have definitely reached a firm conclusion. A typical mistake when working on such training exercises is to look up the solution when all you have done is find the first move of one variation. There are in fact a few exercises in which the key move is very easy to find, but for a com- plete answer to the question a very substantial continuation has to be worked out. To avoid the dan- ger of self-deception in this respect, it is best to write your answers down. To polish your technique further we recommend that you play through both grandmaster games and your own games and always place emphasis on themes in the chapters of this book. You will be very surprised to find what new knowledge and insights this brings. Naturally you should study the endings of the great virtuosi, such as Capablanca, Andersson, Karpov and Kramnik. You will notice that many players are particularly strong in some of the stra- tegic areas that we deal with; for example, Smyslov in the sphere of exchanges, Petrosian in pro- phylactic thinking and hindering counterplay, Fischer in the use of the bishop, and Kasparov in piece activity. To particularly ambitious players we further recommend looking for additional positions and in- structive examples for each section and storing them as future training material. However, mere knowledge and training are no substitute for real play. This brings us to our most important piece of advice: you should in no way limit yourself to the study of this book - you need to play, play and keep playing. In this respect we recommend that you play out your endgames, and on no account agree an early draw in a rich position. You will only be able to develop your endgame skills quickly if you combine your newly acquired knowledge with sufficient practical play.

EMANUEL LASKER
When there are only a few pieces left on the board, the activity of each piece acquires much greater importance. Whereas in the middlegame the unfavourable position of a piece can be compensated by the activity of other pieces, in the endgame there are simply not enough other pieces available to make up for a badly-placed colleague. For a better illustration of this rule, picture the following: if a player on a soccer team is sent off and can take no further part in the game, then it is still possible that the rest of his team can bring the game to a successful conclusion by each playing harder. But if in a doubles match in tennis one player had to retire hurt, then his remaining team-mate would stand no chance against the opposing pair. Thus the old positional principle that one should always improve the position of the worst-placed piece is particularly applicable in the endgame. Here there is also the rule of thumb that the strongest piece should always be activated. And, in marked contrast to the opening and middlegame, the king should be fully involved. The order of priority in which the pieces should be activated is generally: queen > rook > king > minor piece. Owing to its great practical importance, we shall focus our discussion here on the activity of the king and the rook. Both these pieces play a special role in the endgame and it is fre- quently worth sacrificing one or more pawns to activate them. For examples of the activity of the knight and the queen, see Chapter 7 ('The Fight for the Initiative'). With these two pieces it is generally less a question of which is the more active than which is in the driving seat. A) King Activity In the middlegame the king is a mere extra; in the endgame, on the other hand, one of the prin- cipals.
ARON NIMZ0W1TSCH
Al) An Endgame is Not a Middlegame In most endgames the position of the king is a significant factor in the assessment of the posi- tion. Whereas in the opening and the middle- game the king generally has to hide from the opposing pieces, as the number of pieces on the board goes down the king gains in attacking power and, since there is no danger of being mated, it can often venture deep into the enemy camp. There is the following rale of thumb: the fewer the pieces on the board, the more impor- tant is the position of the king for the evaluation of the position. In pawn endings this can often be the most important factor in the assessment of the position. Therefore in your own end- games always consider whether you can im- prove the position of your king. Now we shall illustrate the more active king by means of some practical examples from ac- tual master play. It is truly amazing to see what a mighty weapon the king can be in the endgame. In the typical Griinfeld endgame on the fol- lowing page, Kramnik shows excellent tech- nique. He no longer has any worries about king safety and is able to assert his advantage in the centre by means of a king-march. I*f2! The immediate 1 e5? fails to l..Bb4+. I...e5 2 Nc5!

But a win- ning plan is not obvious, since White threatens to distract the black rook with his a-pawn and use the time gained to improve his pieces. Since the remaining pawns would then be all on one wing. White would have real drawing chances. However, Zsofia Polgar grasps the essence of the position perfectly. She realizes that her king is the only piece which is not in play and de- cides to activate it. It is truly amazing to see the effect of the black king's advance over the next few moves.

22 How TO PLAY CHESS ENDGAMES
Russian Cht (Sochi) 2004 Linares 1992 In this type of endgame, the king should as a rule blockade the enemy passed pawn, so that the rook can remain active. Incidentally, this consideration matches the order of priority for activating the pieces that we gave in the intro- duction to this chapter: an active rook is usually even more effective than an active king.

Of course it can also happen that a king ad- vances too far into the enemy camp and is sub- jected to a sacrificial counter-attack, as in the following diagram. With his dangerous passed pawns and active king, White has a clear advantage. He proceeds impeccably: IbS Nb7 2 "Jd5 f6+I? With the idea that after 3 Qxf6 Qxf6 4 'S'xfb Bxg2 5 Ji.f5 the white bishop does not control the queening square of his h-pawn and so Black has the possibility of giving up his bishop for the b-pawn. Actually White need not be afraid of this variation, since the posi- tion should be an easy win with sound tech- nique. Short, however, treated his opponent's defensive idea with a degree of respect and de- cided that he should first make his king even more active. The king paid for it with his life. The game continued:
3 Ne6?? .Nc8# (0-1)
Such oversights are by no means unusual in the endgame and happen time after time. The reason is obvious: in view of the reduced mate- rial and the well-centralized king, it is hard for our brain to conceive a possible mating pattern. So watch out for this! In the position on the following page, for ex- ample, it is not clear how to assess the situation of the black king. Some circumspection is re- quired, since there is still quite a lot of material left on the board.
1...Bbc8!
Excellent! Black must seek to case the pres- sure through exchanges. The more pieces that disappear from the board, the better it will be for his king.
2 Bxc8 Bxc8 3 Bxa6
Now Black must make a vital decision:
3...5d8!
Once again Svidler reacts carefully. Counter- play is what is required just now! However, the h4-pawn is shielding the black king: 3...Nxh4? would just open the floodgates; for example, 4

Opposite-coloured bishops generally favour the attacker. Nevertheless in this position Black can allow the exchange of queens without suf- fering any diminution of his initiative. The rea- son lies in the miserable position of the white king. He can be condemned to life imprison- ment, whereas his opposite number can slowly but surely move into action.

Find the best move for White. A2) Cutting Off the King Restricting the mobility of the opposing pieces is an important endgame principle. In the fol- lowing section we shall therefore consider some examples in which one player keeps the oppos- ing king away from the main area of struggle, or even cuts it out of the game completely. If you can keep the enemy king out of play you usually gain a great advantage. In many cases it is as if one side is playing 'a piece up', as it were, since an important enemy unit is not tak- ing part in the battle.

The king frequently has several routes to his des- tination, but usually they are not all of equal value.

2 The Art of Pawn Play
[Pawns] are the very Life of this Game.
FRANCOIS-ANDRE DANICAN PHILIDOR
The older I get, the more I value pawns.
PAUL KERBS
In contrast to all the other pieces, pawns cannot move backwards. They take tiny steps and there are often long delays between each pawn move. On account of this leisurely progress, it is often the case that the pawn-structure changes only very slowly and hence it leaves its stamp on the position for some considerable time. Of course, you can never deduce the best move just from a consideration of the pawn-structure alone, but in most cases this does give definite clues as to the direction in which one's thoughts should be pointed. This fact alone is enough to demon- strate the great importance of the pawns. So consider each pawn move carefully! Before we become immersed in the subject- matter. we should like to point out that this theme also overlaps with other chapters. You can find related subject-matter, for example, in Chapter 6 on the theme of pawn weaknesses, in Chapter 5 on support-points for pieces, and in Chapter 4 on pawn exchanges. Finally, the im- portant rule of thumb 'don't move pawns on the wing where the opponent has the advantage' is closely examined in Chapter 17. A) Passed Pawns For me, the passed pawn has a soul, just like a human being, unacknowledged desires slum- bering deep within, and fears, of whose exis- tence it is scarcely aware.
ARON N1MZ0W1TSCH
In the endgame, passed pawns increase enor- mously in importance, in comparison with the other phases of the game. In the endgame they either play a diversionary role or are even the decisive factor. The former case arises if the passed pawn is so dangerous that it draws the fire of the opposing forces, who are thus forced to abandon the main battle-zone. Thus, for in- stance, an outside passed pawn (see Al) often diverts the enemy king. Protected passed pawns (see A2) have the advantage that they compel enemy pieces to adopt defensive duties, yet do not require protection by their own pieces. Thus the presence of protected passed pawns gener- ally increases the overall activity of the side that has them. Passed pawns arc generally a decisive fac- tor if they are so powerful that, despite all ob- structions, they succeed in promoting, or if they force the opponent to give up material to prevent their advance. For example, connected passed pawns (see A3) advancing in 'close formation' are as a rule extremely hard to stop. Not only can they can defend each other, but they can also help one other by controlling the squares that each needs to move to. Basically, when there are passed pawns, the following rules of thumb are applicable:
1. Passed pawns must be pushed.
2. In any race between passed pawns, it is not
the quantity but the quality of the passed pawns that counts. All these aspects will now be enlarged upon, point by point. Al) Outside Passed Pawns In pawn endings and minor-piece endings, an outside passed pawn is a particularly powerful force, since it diverts the main defender. In the diagram on the following page, Lar- sen's king must deal 'personally' with the a- pawn, enabling White to seize the advantage on the kingside:
40 HOW TO PLAY CHESS ENDGAMES
The rule formulated by Botvinnik that "knight endings are just like pawn endings" applies es- pecially when an outside passed pawn is pres- ent, since in knight endings this also generally constitutes a great advantage. The knight cannot lose a tempo, so that zugzwang plays an impor- tant role, just as in pawn endings. Furthermore, a sound extra pawn is normally a winning ad- vantage. Naturally there are also some differ- ences, such as the sacrifice of the knight and other tactical resources by the tricky knight. But now, back to the outside passed pawn: R.Fischer - B.Larsen Denver Ct (5) 1971 1 *d4 *d6 2 aS f6 3 a6 Nc6 4 a7 *b7 S *dS h4
5...f5 6h4+-.

A2) Protected Passed Pawns A lot depends here on which piece blockades the pawn and how restricted this piece is by having to act as a blockader. If a strong block- ading knight stands in its way, a protected passed pawn loses much of its power and in- fluence. In a pawn ending, however, a pro- tected passed pawn is a real force, since the king himself has to deal with it.

However, we must admit that it was (rather surprisingly for us) not very easy to track down a suitable position- In the database you gener- ally find either games in which a protected passed pawn is securely blockaded and which end in favour of the blockading side, or else positions in which the side with a protected passed pawn is so obviously on top that they are not really suitable as instructive examples for this book. But it would be wrong to conclude from this that a protected passed pawn can play an important role only in pawn endings. The truth seems to be that players have such great regard for the protected passed pawn that they allow the opponent to create one only if they are in great difficulties or if, on the other hand, they are quite sure that it can be securely blockaded. lAc2 Botvinnik's plan consists of undermining the black queenside pawns with b3 followed by a4.
1...<a<i7
Let us hear what Botvinnik has to say about this position: "Tai has created definite coun- ter-chances. His immediate aim should be to M.Botvinnik- M.Tal Moscow Wch (13) 1961 blockade the pawn with his knight, which in this case would be fulfilling a mass of useful functions, without itself being in danger. After this, the queenside pawns could have gradu- ally begun to advance. In concrete terms it could have taken the following form: 2 Qe2 Sac8, and then 3...Qf6, 4,..l?3e8 and 5,..Qd6. Of course, while manoeuvring, Black would have to adapt to the opponent's plans and moves. But even if there occurred 4...?Jf6,
6...Q>e8 and 8...Qd6, this would do Black no
harm. After rejecting this plan, Tai was faced with the sad necessity of blockading the pawn with the rook. The blockade theorist Nimzo- witsch would have condemned him for this. One should blockade with a piece which, in so doing, retains its ability to attack."

Once again let us listen to Botvinnik: "Per- haps the losing move. The bishop at b7 is shut out of play for a long time and, most impor- tantly, White can carry out his plan unhindered. Black should have decided on 3...b4."

Since passed pawns have such strong forward momentum, blockading them is often an abso- lute priority; for this task a knight often renders good service. First Black paralyses White's central major- ity: l...eS 2 dS Qc4 3 2e2 Qd6 4 2bl In the next phase, Black activates his pieces, before addressing the mobilization of his own majority.

A further example of the legendary strength of a blockading knight: The rook is not a good blockader since, in contrast to the knight, it exerts no active power from its blockading square. Furthermore it can White cannot really profit from his lead in easily be dislodged by pieces of lesser value. development, since he cannot open the position in his favour. In fact, he should already be thinking about damage limitation, since Black has the following idea at his disposal:

This is a tactical opera- tion in which an enemy pawn is diverted to leave the way open for a friendly pawn to run on. Since a pawn breakthrough is always based on the sacrifice of one or more of one's own pawns, it generally leads to a considerable sharpening of the struggle and requires accurate and concrete calculation. We start with a simple but classic example: A.Shikova - E.Kalmukova Sofia 1971 Owing to the weakened black pawn-struc- ture, as well as her own active king, here too White can win with the help of a breakthrough. But first she must carry out a few preparatory measures:

His rook is passive and his king cannot rush to its assistance, since Black would then bombard the king with checks. Stean finds the only practical chance, which resides in a pawn breakthrough on the kingside.

White has a f3-g4-h5 pawn-chain and can be forced to play gxf5, leaving the h5- pawn loose. Of course, outposts can also be un- dermined: RSvidler - V.Topalov Moielia/Linares 2006 1 a4!

ALEXANDER KOTOV
Although the pawn is the weakest piece on the chess board, it actually contains a lot of venom and vitality, so that from time to time it can play a very powerful role. In the endgame its importance increases considerably, since pro- motion to a queen always beckons, and the number of pieces that can engage it is con- stantly diminishing. Sometimes therefore the creation of one or more dangerous passed pawns can even be worth great material losses. In this section we want to demonstrate a few especially impressive achievements of the mighty pawn. In the first example the great endgame expert Averbakh shows the power of his pawn-mass: H.Zoebisch - A.Diickstein Austrian Ch (Liem) 1981

"Other moves are also insufficient, since the white rook either penetrates on the f-file after the pawn moves h4, g5 and g6, or can even be sacrificed for the knight on d4 if the black rook is on a7." (Zoebisch). 10 d6+ White's pawn avalanche can no longer be stopped.

3 Do Not Rush!
Insufficient patience is probably the most com- mon reason for a lost game.
BENT LARSEN
I reject the misconception that each move must immediately achieve something; waiting moves and quiet moves also have their right to exist.
ARON NIMZ0W1TSCH
too long, because the opponent will naturally try to eliminate his weaknesses. Hence we should like to emphasize once again that proceeding according to the principle 'Do not rush' applies first and foremost to less dynamic positions, in which the opponent does not really have any counterplay and in which his weaknesses are of a permanent nature. In positions with a permanent advantage, in which the opponent has no real counterplay and you have everything well under control, good endgame technique consists of not trying to force matters prematurely. Committal decisions, such as pawn moves or piece exchanges, should always be delayed until you are completely sure that you have strengthened your position to the maximum in every respect. Innumerable winning endgames are not in fact won, simply because the side with the advantage wants to force the win as quickly as possible and lacks the necessary patience to strengthen the posi- tion as much as possible before taking decisive action. This principle is also valid even if you can- not calculate any concrete benefit from improv- ing your position in this manner. You never know how useful a small improvement to your position might be in the further course of the game. However, such a leisurely way of pro- ceeding often brings other advantages along with it: this way of playing often exerts psycho- logical pressure in particular, lulling the oppo- nent's vigilance, or disguising what is in fact the only plan. Sometimes the opponent will also lose patience and weaken himself volun- tarily, or mistakenly try to force matters him- self. However, we should caution you against misunderstanding this principle. In every situa- tion you must be prepared to act energetically, and in certain positions you should not wait for A) Preparatory Measures The following position is easy to understand: White has a clearly winning position. In ad- dition to being a protected passed pawn up. White also has the more active pieces and the possibility of creating a second passed pawn on the queenside. It is clear that the decisive break- through will come with the c4 advance. But Anand would not be Anand if he did not effect this advance in the best possible conditions. With a beautiful technical manoeuvre he first of all improves the position of his knight and only then lands the winning blow:

Of course 15 b5 also wins, but then 15...Nc5 would have to be taken into account. Anand wants to play b5 only on the next move and thus deprive Black even of this slight hope.

B) Subtle Technical Moves Before implementing your real plan, it is often worthwhile to probe with a preparatory move or a zwischenzug. For instance, before a rook moves to a certain square, it can sometimes ha- rass the opposing king with a zwischenschach (i.e. a zwischenzug that is check):

You also give the opponent the hope that he is perhaps going to be let off with a draw, only to dash all his hopes with your next move. You can also get closer to the time-control and if the time-limit includes an increment per move you can even gain extra thinking time for yourself.

Be8 32 Bd8! The exchange of a pair of rooks will deprive Black of any chances of counterplay. However, D) The Art of Manoeuvring An important advantage, if you have everything under control and don't rush, lies in the fact that the opponent often experiences extra psycho- logical pressure and loses patience, doing your job for you. So, for example, he might allow an unfavourable exchange, mistakenly open the position, or create fresh weaknesses for the sake of active counterplay. In the following position, the skilful Rus- sian grandmaster Konstantin Aseev (prema- turely deceased) gradually outmanoeuvred his young opponent. 1 <2}b2!

4 The Right Exchange
Bobby Fischer has no bad pieces - he exchanges them. Only his opponents have bad pieces.
WISE SAYING OF A RUSSIAN CHESS TRAINER
The right exchange is actually one of the most difficult positional themes in a game of chess. By this we mean the relative gain of material or positional value and ultimately this is what the game of chess is all about. Whereas in the open- ing or in the middlegame an erroneous ex- change can sometimes be put right, with every reduction in material, exchanging correctly ac- quires ever greater importance. The fewer pieces there are left on the board, the more serious the consequences of a bad exchanging decision usu- ally are. A) The Importance of Exchanges in the Game of Chess Exchanging is the soul of chess.
GEORG KlENINGER
Before we examine concrete exchanging situa- tions in the endgame, we should like to demon- strate to our readers, by means of a complete illustrative game, the importance of exchang- ing for the whole game. It is a very good train- ing method for improving your feel for the right exchange if you study your own games, or games by stronger players, in the light of the exchanging problem. From this it will soon be- come clear that you need to take responsible ex- changing decisions practically throughout the whole game and you will become especially aware of the interconnections between the par- ticular stages of the game. Many an exchanging decision made in the opening or in the middlegame has an effect only in the endgame; for example, consider a Nimzo-Indian game in which on the 72nd move Black captures the doubled white pawn on c4, which White had voluntarily accepted on the fifth move. In the course of a game we carry out many exchanges which are obvious to us. They do not substantially change the character of the position and therefore we generally don't think about them for long. Other transactions involv- ing an exchanging manoeuvre are in practice dictated by knowledge of opening theory and so we don't pay them any special attention. In order to stimulate readers into greater aware- ness of this theme, we have deliberately com- mented on these (generally considered trivial) situations in the annotations to the following game.

White is confronted for the first time in the game with the problem of the right exchange. Should White occupy the centre with 4 cxd5 Qxd5 5 e4 or will he maintain the tension and exert pressure on the centre with further devel- oping moves? Here, this is a matter of taste, and White chooses the latter option. 4&g5 Now Black is posed the question about the right exchange: can he support his centre by means of 4...c6 or does he have to give up the centre with the immediate 4...dxc4?
4...Qe4!
The is the correct decision; after 4...c6?l White would be able to head for a favourable position with an exchange: 5 Axf6 exf6 6 cxd5 cxd5 7 Qb3 Qc6 8 e3 +; if 4...dxc4?l then 5 e4 ±. Now once again White must make an impor- tant exchanging decision. 5 Q>xe4?! dxe4 would

His opponent was, however, intent upon exchanging as many pieces as quickly as possible, thinking that this was the easiest way to force a draw. At this point we should like to warn readers against such a course of action. Any such measures normally involve making concessions and the opponent gradually accumulates small advan- tages. The diagram position on the following page looks easy - dead drawn, wouldn't you say? But be careful. Black has some tiny advan- tages which he can build on. His rooks are ac- tively placed on both the half-open files and his pawn-structure is both more compact and Black faces a very difficult decision: should he capture on cl or on b5?
40...Axcl?!
After 4O...Axb5 41 Sb3 Ne6 Black keeps better control of the play on the light squares; for example, 42 Qc5+ Axc5 43 dxc5 a4 44 Ab2 Qe5. 41 bxc6t- *xc6 42 Aa4+ *dS? A mistake, as White benefits from the pres- ence of the light-squared bishop.

In practice, though, Capablanca's world champion class plays the vital role.
1...Ac8!
A good plan. His opponent is in possession of the bishop-pair and therefore Capablanca wants to exchange one of the enemy bishops. Since his knight is well-placed on e5, Capa- blanca would rather give up his hitherto some- what passive light-squared bishop for the white bishop on d3 and he now plans ...Aa6. 2Ji.fl?! White docilely allows Capablanca to carry out his planned exchange. If he had sufficiently appreciated his great opponent's intentions, he would surely have managed to find 2 Sal. which prevents ...Jta6. In contrast, 2 f4?l is pre- mature, since after 2...Qxd3 3 cxd3 d5 Black has a dangerous initiative, helped by the very important factor of opposite-coloured bishops.

Hc8 1-0 and thus the character of the position substan- tially alters, it is essential to assess the newly- arisen position correctly and precisely. It often happens that pieces which had little or no scope before the exchanging combination are suddenly able to develop previously unfore- seen activity after the exchange of the other pieces. In the following game Polugaevsky played a combination which won two pawns and even activated his rook, and yet he still lost. The following position is hard to evaluate:
4.04
V.Epishin - I.Sokolov Groningen FIDE KO 1997 Black enjoys an extra pawn. However, in re- turn White has the bishop-pair and his queen is very active. A further important criterion for as- sessing this position is the contrasting situation of the kings. Whereas with queens on the board the white king is always going to be a bit inse- cure. after the exchange of queens, the king can venture forward and actively join the fight But with his next move Black discounts this factor.
1...Rc7?l
Black answers the question of the right ex- change incorrectly. He wants to exchange the active white queen but the exchange of queens only plays into White's hands. Correct was

black queen will become active: 3...Qf6+ 4 Qd4Qh4 5h3Qel +. 2Qxc7 Nxc7 3 Be3 fNj

Once more Black fails to solve the problem of the right exchange.

In the other phases of the game, and even in other types of endgame, in view of the complexity of the positions you sometimes have to be content with general evaluations such as 'White has the initiative- , 'Black has compensation'or 'the position is un- clear-. In pawn endings, however, the only eval- uations are 'win', 'loss' or 'draw -. Owing to the reduced material, mistakes in pawn ending can no longer be corrected and therefore you must 7h4? This is too wasteful of tempo moves. 7 ?bg4 g6 8 b4 and White wins as in the game.

In the following game Black had had his back to the wall for some time:
4.06
V.Gavrikov - Y.Yakovich USSR Ch (Kiev) 1986 It is really surprising that Kasparov took the risk of entering such a complicated pawn end- ing, when there were several continuations available to him in which he could prove suffi- cient compensation for his pawn minus. To be fair to Kasparov though, we should be aware of the special psychological situation surrounding this game. Before the tournament Kasparov had already decided to declare his retirement from professional chess after this game and he was therefore under tremendous pressure, all the more so as a draw in this game would have secured a convincing tournament victory. As he himself said in subsequent interviews, he wanted to escape from the unbearable pressure as quickly as possible and so he took the deci- sion to enter the pawn ending. Like Kasparov himself, we are certain that under other circum- stances Garry would never have made this mis- take. Such a fully understandable psychological wish, to terminate an unpleasant pressure situa- tion as quickly as possible, has deprived many a player of the fruits of their stubborn defence. In our database there are many examples in which a player can stand it no longer and, acting in ac- cordance with the motto 'If it's not drawn then Now Black could stand the pressure no lon- ger and acquiesced to a pawn ending. However, if he could only have mustered enough energy to continue to defend a slightly worse position, he would have had good chances of a half- point:

We have actually found in our data- base numerous examples by low-rated players in which overwhelmingly won positions, some- times with great material advantage, were spoilt through an over-hasty liquidation to a pawn ending. The reason was generally a lazy atti- tude towards calculating variations and the de- sire for a quick and easy victory in the pawn ending. So at this point we give a word of warning: it is not important to win quickly; the important thing is to win! On this theme here is another example showing that even 2700- players are merely human:

THE RIGHT EXCHANGE 89
E) Exchanging a Pair of Rooks This theme crops up with particular frequency in the endgame, since from their starting positions in the comer the rooks usually do not enter the fray until later. Often it is a question of retain- ing or eliminating attacking potential against the king, preventing counterplay by a powerful rook or else bringing about a pure 'Fischer end- game' of rook and bishop against rook and knight. You should also always keep in mind the great margin of the draw in pure rook end- ings when making decisions about related ex- changes. The exchange of a pair of rooks has particular importance in positions in which all the rooks are still on the board. Two rooks are generally a powerful force and therefore the exchange of one pair of rooks should be considered very carefully. Often it is expedient for the side with the advantage to exchange a pair of rooks, to deprive the opponent of chances of active coun- terplay. But there are also situations in which in order to play for a win you should keep all the rooks on the board, to take advantage of their great potential activity. In pure rook endings, for example, the presence of both rooks is gen- erally an advantage for the side with the upper hand. So have we have further subdivided this theme: El) The Attacker Wants to Exchange a Pair of Rooks Here it is generally a question of reducing the possibilities of counterplay. The following ex- ample is an excellent illustration of the great practical importance of this theme (seefollow- ing diagram). White would like to exchange all the rooks, or none. Conversely, Black would like to exchange just one pair of rooks, as Jacob Aagaard ex- plained in Excelling at Technical Chess. Then with only a single rook the possession of the d- file would be of no benefit to White, since he would not be able to penetrate. 1 f4? A.Paaske - E.Lund Copenhagen 2003 I Sd2 Nc6 2 Sadi = was indicated. Then, to neutralize the pressure on the d-file, Black would have to exchange all the rooks and White would be able to hold the pure minor-piece end- ing, since Black would not be able to develop sufficient dark-square pressure. With just a sin- gle rook each, however, it is another story. I...ghd8 2 Hd2 3 gadl Sxd2 4 Sxd2 h6 S g3 (D) S...Sg8!? Black wants to mobilize his majority and open a file for his rook. 6Qd6?

Often it is a ques- tion of exchanging into a rook ending or a bishop ending. With rooks on the board, oppo- site-coloured bishops can still provide good attacking chances. Without them it is often a dead draw. Naturally such relief operations can also work with other combinations of material. A.Grishchuk - A.Grosar Batumi Echt 1999

invest a lot of time and energy in order to make the right decision. To break off from a promis- ing attack, you need to be 100% sure that the re- sulting endgame offers winning chances that are at least as good as you would get from con- tinuing the attack. When carrying out such a liquidation, you should not let yourself be fobbed off too cheaply. But you must have the necessary positional understanding, as well as sufficient confidence in your endgame tech- nique, to make the right decision, and you must play whatever the position may require. White has the difficult choice between con- tinuing his attack with 1 @b8+ and liquidating into an endgame with 1 £"xf6. What would you have done?

F) Simplification into an Endgame If one side has the possibility of exchanging into an endgame, this is always a critical point in the game. In such a situation you often have to calculate many moves ahead and accurately evaluate a position of a completely different character compared with the type of position reached in the game up to that point. Often you are faced with the difficult deci- sion between continuing an attack or going into an endgame. Such a moment is always a real turning-point in the game, where you have to

During a game of chess we perform many exchanges which are quite obvious to us. They do not substantially alter the character the position and so, if they seem natural to us. we generally do not have to think about them for very long. Sometimes, however, there are sharp, forced exchanges that alter the character of the posi- tion very substantially. We call such transac- tions 'transformations'. Whereas the elements of time and space play a great role in any trans- formation that takes place in the middlegame, a transformation in the endgame mostly involves the creation of a new, unbalanced distribution of material. In the following example, Black has at least a slight advantage because of his queenside pawn-majority. Exercises (Solutions on pages 303-4)

K) What is Important is What is Left on the Board, Not What Disappears From this it follows that the only important thing is to assess the position that arises. It is irrelevant whether your own piece was more powerful than the enemy piece. L) Avoiding an Unfavourable Exchange Obviously, when two pieces are placed such that they can be exchanged, you should not nec- essarily exchange them. Yet in games between weaker players we see such captures being made time after time, almost without thinking. How important it can sometimes be to resist this temptation is illustrated in the following examples.

The present pawn- structure means that there will be play on both wings and so, with the open centre, the bishop- pair will exert strong pressure. The light-squared bishop will thus have an especially important role to play. After 1,.. .xg2? 2 lSxg2 it is not at all clear who is better.

One is perhaps first inclined to play 2 Sd2, to exchange the active rook. But Loginov under- stands the position better.

5 Thinking in Schemes
I know at sight what a position contains. What could happen? What is going to happen? You figure it out. I know it!

Strategy without tactics is the slowest route to victory. Tactics without strategy is the noise be- fore defeat.
SUN TZU
On the one hand, chess is a very concrete game, in which even the smallest alteration to a posi- tion can have important repercussions; on the other hand it would be hardly possible for hu- mans to master the game if they could not make use of certain schemes and rules of thumb. In the endgame, a schematic way of thinking is particularly appropriate. By this we mean the ability to recognize desirable positions and piece set-ups. and then work out a plan to reach them. If you ask a grandmaster about the as- sessment of an endgame position, you won't generally hear any concrete variations at first, but rather phrases such as "If White succeeds in exchanging the rooks he should win" or "If Black manages to put his bishop on the long di- agonal, he has a certain draw". Typical themes and issues that lend them- selves to schematic thinking are, for example: • how to match the pieces with the pawn-struc- ture • optimal deployment of the pieces or improv- ing the piece set-up • consideration of the right exchange • fortresses • weak squares • knight outposts • pure opposite-coloured bishop endings Of course, when applying this way of think- ing, it is absolutely essential not to think about the position in too static a manner - on no ac- count should you neglect the dynamic factors. A) Target Positions If you have everything under control, but are at a loss how to make progress, it is sometimes beneficial just to visualize desirable target posi- tions and only then to examine whether and how you can achieve them.

M.Karttunen - V.Rasik Rethymnon ECC 2003 In view of the wrong rook's pawn, White cannot allow his knight to be exchanged. But then how can he win? If you try to find a win here by concrete calculation alone, you will im- mediately realize that this is by no means easy. Instead of wasting time on difficult computa- tions. it is much more sensible here for White to think about the best possible arrangement for the pieces. Black's bishop is already restricted as much as possible; the knight will need to support promotion threats, so the idea comes of sticking the king on b5 and the knight on d5. In fact, once this set-up has been achieved, the win is quite easy. I...*a8 2*dS *b7 3 Nd4 *a8 4 Ng5 *b7 S N6 Nh2 6 Nc4 Ng3 7 &bS Nh2 8 Nb6

You could even get into the habit of ex- tending this to sounding out all your pieces, to check whether they are happy and have options for the future. If a piece is in a very flexible po- sition and can quickly come into action, any- where on the board, then generally this piece is well-placed. But if a piece is going to be tied down for a long time performing a not so impor- tant function, then it should always be regarded Av.Bykhovsky - M.Roiz Israeli Cht 2004 The white king would very much like to sup- port the attack, without being harassed by the enemy rook. But before the king can set off for g5 or h6, the knight must be posted in a more central position: 1 53d4 gdl 2 Ne3 gel+ 3 S*?f4 gdl 4 5k6 gfl+ 5 *g5 gfS+?

In the endgame, however, it can be a very different story, especially if the opponent has no real counterplay. In the following diagram, White's winning plan consists of the following steps: Step 1: knight to f5; Step 2: king to e5; Step 3: king to e6; Step 4: threaten to transfer the knight to e7, which leads to the diversion of both defenders and consequently to the win of the d5-pawn which, with the active white king, will decide the game.

6 Weaknesses
Try to saddle your opponent with the sort of pawn-formation that will give him problems.
ARON N1MZ0W1TSCH
A weakness is a defect in the position which is of a long-term nature. As a rule, weaknesses consist of squares, pawns or whole complexes of squares which can no longer be defended by their own pawns. However, the opponent must, at least in the long term, be in a position to take advantage of the weakness; otherwise the term is inappropriate. But you should not fool your- self: it is not enough for you just to follow an active plan, to which the opponent must keep reacting, with the result that your weakness is not directly noticeable at first. As soon as the initiative runs out and the dynamic possibilities diminish, any static weakness generally be- comes all the more significant. A) Pawn- and Square- Weaknesses Al) Pawn Weaknesses Ala) Isolated Pawns A pawn on a half-open file with no friendly pawns on the two neighbouring files is called an isolated pawn. Since such a pawn always needs the protection of pieces, it tends to be- come a weakness, and especially quickly in the endgame. In the following example, first White prevents any counterplay and then he takes aim at the black pawn weaknesses one by one, espe- cially the isolated c-pawn, condemning the black pieces to passivity: 1 gel c5 2 *e3 Nf7 3 gc4 gd7 4 3a4 hS S Ea6gc7

gd8 16 d7 e4 17 Nd6 +-. 13 5*?xc4 gb7 14 gc8 1-0 By the way, it is absolutely typical that posi- tions with many pawn weaknesses are particu- larly suitable for knights, since in that case they have more secure bases and can frequently gain the upper hand, at least if the opponent has few or no dynamic possibilities available. However, with an unweakened structure, the side with the bishop can operate more easily against the knight, as, for example, in 9.01 Englisch-Stein- itz. Further examples of a weak isolated pawn in the endgame, as well as the techniques of blockade and siege, are 4.29 Fischer-Petrosian and 17.09 Rublevsky-L utier.

Too Far Sometimes a far-advanced pawn secures a space advantage, which can then slowly but surely be increased (more about this in Chapter 15). But things can turn out quite differently; the unit that has strayed far from its base can sometimes be surrounded, besieged and finally captured. Ale) Backward Pawns A backward pawn is a pawn on a half-open file that can no longer be protected by another pawn and the square in front of which can not be protected either. Such a pawn therefore has a strong tendency to become a weakness.

A single weakness is usually not much of a problem, provided that it can be comfortably de- fended. Hence the great importance of the prin- ciple of the second weakness, which we shall consider in Section E of this chapter. But some- times even a single weakness can prove fatal.

In view of the strong light-squared blockade it is now hard for White to breach Black's defences. Here too the principle of the second weakness retains its importance. After Kar- pov's next move it should definitely be drawn; however, it remains doubtful whether he had a significantly better continuation at this point.

A2) Weak Squares A square that can no longer be defended by a friendly pawn is weak. B) A Complex of Weak Squares One weak square often turns into a whole com- plex of weak squares. This is especially often the case if the pawns are fixed on squares of one colour and the bishop of the opposite colour has been exchanged. Reefat bin Satter - E.Hossain Dhaka 1999 White will abstain from playing d4 and in- stead will use the important d4-square as a tran- sit-point for his pieces.

E) The Principle of the Second Weakness The defender can generally protect one weak- ness quite comfortably. But in doing so he natu- rally loses some flexibility. The attacker is often able to take advantage of this by creating a sec- ond weakness or opening a second front, since he can switch his forces more easily. In order to breach Black's defences, however, White must open a second front and inflict a second weakness on the enemy. lfibl! Planning b4.

Black's pawn- structure is damaged and the black knight has to guard the weakness at e5. In addition, White has more space and his pieces are more active. White still needs targets on the kingside, so he uses his h-pawn to undermine Black's struc- ture:

7 The Fight for the Initiative
Initiative means superiority.
JOSE RAUL CAPABLANCA
Nowhere is time-wasting more severely pun- ished than in chess.
SAMUEL RESHEVSKY
Just as in the other phases of the game, the struggle for the initiative also plays an impor- tant role in the endgame. Only the side that has the initiative can impose his own ideas and si- multaneously compel the opponent to drop his own plans. So always try to fight for the initia- tive and dictate the course of events. A game of chess does not win itself! The possession of the initiative is a dynamic advantage and therefore not necessarily long- lasting. Consequently the difficulty often re- sides not only in seizing the initiative, but also in retaining and exploiting an existing initia- tive. We shall examine several examples of both these themes in this chapter. A) The Importance of the Initiative If an advantage is of a short-term and dynamic nature, then rapid and active exploitation is in- dicated. Only if you can manage to remain in control, do you have the chance of retaining or transforming the advantage. We should like to illustrate this first through the especially interesting special case of the endgame of rook and knight against rook and knight. Here a slight initiative can often be enough to make life hard for the opponent. The following position is almost symmetri- cal. but the white Imight is actively placed and it is White to move.

This exchange of the active white rook is not very convincing. Admittedly White also retains the advantage in the knight endgame, but with an active rook too it would be easier to exploit it: I6 2c8+*e7 !7Sc7 *e8 (17...a5 18 Nd3 a4 19 bxa4 bxa4 20 Sa7 +-; 17...Nd6 18 Sa7 +-) 18 Qc6 Qc5 19 b4Sb7 20 Sxb7 Qxb7 21 *d4 +-.

C) Psychology One important advantage of having the initia- tive is of a psychological nature.

Even as strong a grandmaster as Adams went astray in the following example:

In this game White was rewarded for his bold decision. There are, however, just as many cases in which a player was punished for a sim- ilarly uncompromising decision with a defeat. We therefore issue you with this warning: Please always keep clearly in mind that volun- tarily weakening your structure is an extremely committal decision. You need to be really sure that it is worth the risks involved, and also that the initiative gained is lasting and sustainable. It is no use to you if all that happens is that you are able to brandish some threats for a few moves, after which your initiative, once the op- ponent has successfully parried your short-term threats, gradually seeps away. In such a case the structural weakness that you have created will just be all the more clearly exposed.

But if there are a lot of unprotected pieces and an exposed king in the enemy camp, then the queen is in her element.

8 Prophylaxis and Prevention of
Counterplay To demand of a piece only direct attacking ac- tivity is the stamp of a mere wood-shifter. The keener chess mind quite rightly demands of the pieces that they also undertake preventive ac- tion. ARON NlMZOWtTSCH You never play a game of chess on your own, but always in combat with an opponent. He too will be trying to give of his best. He will try to implement his own strategies and plans and do everything to mould the course of the game in accordance with his own ideas. It is therefore in the nature of things that you can only be suc- cessful if you manage to come to grips with the intentions your opponent and combat them ef- fectively. And so, of course, first of all you must discern them. Many of the opponent's ideas are quite obvi- ous on the basis of your prior chess knowledge. You apprehend others intuitively or you dis- cover them by calculating variations. In addi- tion, there is another important aid to detecting the opponent's intentions more effectively. We are talking here about the technique known as 'prophylactic thinking1. By this is meant the skill of regularly asking yourself during a game: what is my opponent planning? What would he do. if it were his turn to move? Only by conducting this sort of interior monologue during a game, regularly asking yourself these or similar questions, can you penetrate really deeply into your opponent's thinking. Applying this way of thinking is of special importance in the endgame. Since both play- ers in the middlegame and in the opening usu- ally have several plans and ideas available, you don't generally manage to eliminate all the opponent's options. In the endgame, how- ever. owing to the reduced material, the range of possibilities worth considering is generally much narrower. Here if you are able to foil the opponent's intentions then success is generally not far away. In addition, this thinking method also helps you spot zugzwang positions. Prophylactic thinking is extraordinarily im- portant in converting an advantage. In such situ- ations it is often an urgent necessity to recognize the opponent's possible counter-chances at the right moment and nip potential counterplay in the bud. Try to leant this technique. Study the games of the great prophylactic players such as Kar- pov or Petrosian and then always pay attention to what your opponent's last move threatens or plans. A) Foiling the Opponent's Plans Has this ever happened to you? Just when you get a good idea, your opponent makes a move that stops everything and you are frustrated. In the following example, Black was deprived of his last glimmer of hope by a prophylactic move. White's main plan obviously consists of ex- ploiting the pin. But after the immediate 1 .Na4? Black escapes with 1...5M4. Of course. White would then avoid the exchange of rooks, but he would still have to work hard for the full point in the vs ending. However, since he has time due to the fact that Black has no way to escape the pin, he simply rules out Black's escape clause:

However, Black is threaten- ing to unpin with I ...Bb5l, after which the po- sition would no longer be clear, in view of Black's passed a-pawn. lEa2l! With this move, Euwe prevents this relief op- eration in elegant fashion. The pin is now perma- nent and White can exploit his pawn-majority in the centre.

9 The Bishop-Pair in the Endgame
The bishop-pair ... something to win with.

Wilhelm Steinitz understood that the bishop- pair is stronger than bishop + knight, since the basic disadvantage of the bishop - that it can in- fluence only the squares of its own colour - is offset by the presence of its colleague. Note that when one bishop is exchanged, its colleague is also weakened, because then the opponent's pieces can safely operate on squares of the op- posite colour. Since the bishops are long-range pieces, the advantage of the bishop-pair is espe- cially (but not exclusively, as we shall see) ap- parent in open positions. A) Steinitz's Method of Restriction This is based on the relative lack of mobility of the knight, which sometimes makes it very hard for it to reach or leave particular complexes of squares. The following classic is such an excel- lent demonstration of this that we really must include it (see next diagram'). Besides the bishop-pair, Black also has com- plete control over the position and a slight ini- tiative, which prove to be a deadly mixture.

THE BlSHOP-PAIR IN THE ENDGAME 153
B) Transformation Apart from the applicability of the Steinitz re- striction method, one of the greatest advantages of the bishop-pair lies in the fact that it is gener- ally easier to exchange a bishop than a knight. Of course, liquidation into pure opposite- coloured bishop endings should always be very precisely calculated because of their strong drawing tendency. The following famous example is substan- tially more complicated:

To see how Kramnik now opened the posi- tion for his bishops, refer to 9.07. Control and initiative are sometimes worth more than a pawn. How did White stamp out Black's resistance? C) Control One of the main aims of the side with the bish- ops is to gain the control of the position, so that he can open it on his own terms. In the follow- ing example, Kramnik keeps increasing his ad- vantage slowly but surely: V.Kramnik - M.Ulybin Khalkidhiki 1992 9.05 G.Kamsky - V.Kramnik 1 gfdl h6?I Monaco (Amber blindfold) 1996 This makes it easier for White to open the kingside later.

Of course, I (KM) am not claiming that I would have won it. c) 4 Efl?! Nb5 (4...Q>c4? 5 Acl Axel 6 Bxcl Nd2 7 Bxc2! is not Black's intention) 5 *g3 (5 Acl?

4...Ab4 (D)
If 4...Qc4? 5 Acl Axel 6 Bxcl Nd2 then, as in the variation with 4 Bfl, comes 7 Bxc2.'. After 7...Qxf3 8 Bc7+ Ng6 9 *f2 only White has winning chances, since his rook is very powerful on the open board. This stands in marked contrast to the note to White's 7th move, after which the white rook is completely domi- nated, even though there is only one additional minor piece left on the board. This is in accor- dance with the general rule of thumb, that the side playing against the rook should not ex- change pieces. Generally, the more open and empty the board, the stronger the rook.

How did the game finish? G) Two Bishops against Rook and Minor Piece In the endgame it is sometimes not clear which of these combinations of pieces is the stronger.

10 Zugzwang
Zugzwang is like getting trapped on a safety is- land in the middle of a highway when a thun- derstorm starts. You don't want to move but you have to.
ARTHUR BlSGUIER
Normally it is a great advantage to have the move, since you can parry or set up threats, or simply continue with your plan. But if all your own pieces are already optimally placed, then this right to move can become an obligation and thus a great problem. It would be nice if you could pass and let the opponent move again, but in chess this is just not allowed. We should pause here briefly to make sure we are thoroughly aware of the implications of this. Without zugzwang you couldn't even force checkmate with king and rook against a bare king, and many pawn endings would be drawn, since the defending king could just stay put on his ideal square and no power in the world could shift him. So we are grateful that a player not only can move but actually must move. In practice, zugzwang is a common weapon of the attacker, facilitating the win and sometimes making it possible in the first place. A) A Powerful Endgame Weapon If all your opponent's pieces are well-placed but he is short of moves, you should be sensi- tive to this and always ask yourself what his next move is actually going to be. How should White make progress in the fol- lowing diagram? He asked himself what Black's next move was going to be. The rook has to pro- tect the h4-pawn and the a-file, and the king has to protect c8 and c7. So, that leaves only ...Nd8, but after Bh7 the problem is the same. Conse- quently all White has to do is to find a way to

Dig or die.
TRADITIONAL ARMY ADVICE FOR DEFENDER
CONSTRUCTING FORTIFICATION
In times gone by. a nobleman with just a hand- ful of followers had good chances of saving his bacon against a superior enemy force. All he had to do was take refuge inside his castle, raise the drawbridge and hope that the besiegers would go away before hunger and thirst got the better of the defenders. In many endgames, setting up such an im- pregnable position is the only method of de- fence. A secure set-up of pieces and pawns, which the opponent cannot overwhelm, even with a great material or positional advantage, is known as an impregnable fortress. Since chess pieces, unlike noblemen, generally do not suffer from either hunger or thirst, a fortress that can- not be stormed generally leads in chess to a draw. In this chapter we shall present all the types of fortress that can occur in a chess game. However, we are not concerned so much here with a theoretical investigation of these positions, but rather with the practical aspect. If our readers add the fortress concept to their arsenal of defen- sive weapons, we shall have achieved our goal. A) Elementary Fortresses By elementary fortresses, we mean theoreti- cally drawn positions with reduced material, in which passive defence is sufficient to draw, de- spite the weaker party having a clear material disadvantage. The following diagram shows the best known of all fortresses. Despite the huge material ad- vantage of a minor piece and a pawn. White can- not win. For positions of this sort, the following definition of a draw applies: an endgame with a bare king against an opposing rook's pawn and

Fortress I a so-called 'wrong bishop', i.e. a bishop which cannot control the queening square of the pawn, is drawn if the defending king can reach the queening square of the pawn, or one of the three neighbouring squares (in this case a7. b7 and b8). The side with the bishop can stalemate the opposing king in various ways, but he can never evict it from the comer, nor promote the pawn without it being immediately captured. Of course the difficulty is not in holding this absolutely drawn position; a novice can man- age this after his third lesson. No, as with all the positions in this chapter, the great difficulty lies in recognizing the existence of a concealed de- fensive idea at the right moment. The following position looks clearly favourable for White (see diagram on following page). White has not only an extra pawn, but also the more active king and a dangerous passed pawn on the e-file. However, if Black notices at the right moment that White has the wrong bishop relative to his h-pawn, his defensive strategy is obvious: he must try to eliminate the white e- and f-pawns and can do this even at the cost of all his pawns and even the knight.

Y.Averbakh It is very important to know that the presence of one or more extra g-pawns sometimes com- plicates the defender's task considerably or even makes it impossible. The defending king can in this case be stalemated, after which the g-pawn is forced to move and the 'ugly duckling' rook's pawn turns into a knight's pawn 'swan'. Black will be put in zugzwang and his king 'stalemated'. Then ...b4 is forced and after axb4 the winning passed pawn appears.

C) Pawn-Barriers Sometimes the defender succeeds in construct- ing a fortress system in which the whole board is divided by an impenetrable barrier of pawns. Then even a very great material advantage is of- ten not sufficient to win, since the king (or sometimes also other pieces of the attacker) cannot enter the enemy half of the board. Prob- ably the best-known example of a such pawn- barrier is the following: El 1.18 **/ B How did White break through?

I_.?k5! 2 Bxa7 ?Nxa7 3 bxcS dxcS = Black has a simple drawing plan: he puts his king on c7, after which the queenside is safe against any infiltration by the white king, and then he simply oscillates his bishop between d6 and e7. Black's fortress cannot be breached by a bishop sacrifice at h6 either: if the white king stays on the queenside, then .SLh6 will always be answered by ....Nf8, with the threat of ...gxh6. If White prepares the Nh6 sacrifice by S'hS, Black need not take on h6 (since then g7 fol- lows), but can simply wait with a king move. The pawn-barrier is also an important defen- sive idea in pawn endings themselves. Take a look at what happened in the following game:

and the draw is obvious, since the black king can no longer escape his prison on the edge of the board. For a proper understanding of this method of defence, it is absolutely essential to know that, to draw, it is generally not enough just to incarcer- ate the opposing king. It must also be established that he will remain in his prison 'for life'. There are particular positions in which the stronger side can use zugzwang to force the jailer to El 1.28 **/ How did White breach the wall? D) Incarcerating Pieces Dl) An Incarcerated King Sometimes the defender manages to incarcer- ate the enemy king on the edge of the board and thus keep him out of the game. Without their leader, the remaining pieces are often then pow- erless. In the following example, it is obviously not possible for White to stop the black passed pawns.

The b6-bishop is imprisoned for ever in the black camp and can sacrifice itself for a pawn at best. White cannot force the bishop's release, since Black has available some easy waiting moves with the b4-bishop. The following marvellous composition by the then 7-year-old Smyslov gives an impres- sive illustration of a rook being shut out of play: There seem to be two ways to set up a fortress. Which is the right one? D2) Pieces Shut Out of Play Of course, the king is not the only piece that can be shut out of play; it can happen to any of the other pieces too. In the following example.

E) Tied and Pinned Pieces Sometimes the weaker side succeeds in saving a tricky situation in which one or more of the hostile pieces is tied down by a strong threat. The tied pieces are then incapable of develop- ing any activity and this makes the conversion of a material advantage impossible. El) Tied to a Pawn Often the stronger side is unable to convert his advantage, since the defender threatens to cap- ture the last pawn (or one of the last pawns) and thus bring about a distribution of forces that is stone-cold drawn. The pieces are then tied to the defence of the pawn and are thus unable to develop sufficient active power to breach the enemy defences. The following example is a beautiful demonstration of what this means:

Now the trap has snapped shut and Fritz's operator was forced to give the position up as a draw. The bishop is absolutely worthless, since it is tied by the pin for the rest of the game. But to be fair to Fritz it should be noted that, in the orig- inal position, converting the extra piece looks very difficult or even well nigh impossible any- way. But humans can also land themselves in such permanent pins. In the following position White looks in a very bad way and it seems as if he will have to give up his rook for the black a-pawn. But he found a brilliant saving idea: Are the passed pawns dangerous? E4) Pinning Another form of permanent tie of one or more pieces is the pin. It is often not possible for the stronger side to make use of his material advan- tage if one of his pieces is permanently pinned. The following game greatly amused the whole chess world.

11.51
To conclude this chapter, we would like to draw attention to another typical mistake that very A.Gurvich Shakhniaty, 1927
214 HOW TO PLAY CHESS ENDGAMES
frequently leads to the creation of a fortress. It sounds incredible, but it is true: perusing our database we have found many hundreds of ex- amples in which a player spoiled a completely winning position by the over-hasty promotion of a pawn to a queen. The scenario was always the same: the stronger side was so dazzled by the chance of a quick promotion that he forgot to pay any heed to the opponent's possibilities. And in the time it took for the pawn to reach the eighth rank, the weaker side managed to construct a fortress. It is as if the prospect of getting a queen blinds one to everything else. The following example shows such a case. White saw the possibility of a promotion, switched off all the alarms and sent his pawn on its journey. Just thinking about a queen seems to make even a grandmaster weak. We shall provide a few further examples. In the following position White is clearly all set to win easily with his extra exchange and dangerous passed pawn:

D.Barua - G.Barbero Thessaloniki OL 1988 In the game White now saw the possibility of promoting his pawn immediately into a queen, and played over-hastily: 1 b7?!

No doubt there is some truth in this aphorism, since plodding on in a completely lost position not only makes no sense at all, but also shows a lack of respect towards the opponent. However, as the following examples show, it can some- times - if you have discovered a hidden stale- mate possibility - be worth putting on a straight face, making another couple of moves and put- ting your faith in your very last chance.

13 Mate
To you, Herr Lasker, 1 have only three words to say: check and mate.
SlEGBERT TARRASCH
In 19 endgames out of 20. you don't have to worry about your king being unexpectedly mated. But woe betide anyone who forgets the exception!
EDMAR MEDN1S
One of the most important differences between the middlegame and the endgame is the factor of king safety. In the majority of endings you do not have to think about the safety of your king and therefore the direct attack on the king is normally just a middlegame theme. But mate is actually the goal of each game of chess and therefore even in positions with only a few pieces left there can be situations in which the enemy king will be the target of a mating at- tack. In contrast to the middlegame, even your own king can sometimes join in an attack on his opposite number, which naturally leads to a dan- gerous superiority in force in the relevant sector of the board. Often the difficulty lies not so much in the calculation of the relevant varia- tions as in adapting your thinking mode and imagining a possible mating pattern at the ap- propriate moment. This explains why some of the mating situations that arise in endgames are caused by carelessness, where one player has simply not imagined that a mate was possible. Make sure that in your own games you al- ways stay alert and never forget that the word 'mate' is not foreign to the endgame! A) An Incarcerated King At first sight the following position seems to be totally drawn, but Frias still has a poisoned ar- row in his quiver:

By the way, a rook could not do this so easily, since on its own it can dominate a knight on an open board only if the knight is close to a comer; for example, on gl , g2, h I or h2. Nevertheless, playing for domination is the main weapon of the player who is the exchange up, as we shall see. Another knight or the king can totally dom- inate a knight only if the latter is in the very cor- ner square. Exercises (Solutions on pages 336-7) Ninety percent of all games of chess are de- cided by factors dependant on material or time, such as mate, tactics or pawn promotion, for ex- ample. The remaining ten percent are decided by domination, absolute control and slow suf- focation of the opponent.
LUBOMIR FTAtNIK
Playing for domination is one of the most impor- tant strategies in chess, which has been devel- oped to a very high level by players such as Karpov and Kramnik. If you can manage to de- prive the opposing pieces of prospects and grad- ually restrict them more and more, until in the end they can hardly breathe, then generally just one push, such as the opening of a second front or, in the ideal case, zugzwang, is all that is re- quired to cause the whole edifice to collapse.

We shall thus confine ourselves to just a few important cases in this area. Normally the pawn- less endgame of rook against knight is drawn, if the knight is close to its king.

The way to achieve this will be discussed in this section. Cl) Restricting a Bishop According to Capablanca's rule, in same-colour bishop endings you should in general place your pawns on squares of the colour that the bishop does not control. That way they comple- ment each other and the enemy bishop cannot attack the pawns. But under favourable condi- tions the reverse can also be correct: setting up a solid pawn-formation on the colour of the op- posing bishop can sometimes condemn it to complete passivity. 1 c5!

C3) Restricting the Whole Enemy Force As we have already seen, there are several de- grees of domination ranging from the start of this strategy right up to total domination, where the opponent finds himself almost in zugzwang, in the next example, Psakhis already has his op- ponent practically bound hand and foot, but he must play precisely in order to frustrate any ma- noeuvres by Black aimed at freeing his position or relieving it through exchanges. But the utmost caution is required in the fol- lowing duel, since White will try everything to dominate the knight and not let it go back to f6:

15 Converting an Advantage
• Unfocused activity at the critical moment • Problems with the transformation of an ad- vantage Now please compare these lists with the con- tents of this book. You will notice that we have actually attached such great importance to all these aspects of converting an advantage that we have devoted whole sections to many of them. You simply must master the following tech- niques and principles if your 'won positions' are truly going to be won: • prophylactic thinking and preventing coun- terplay (Chapter 8) • the application of the principle 'Do not rush!' (Chapter 3) • the right exchange (Chapter 4) • the principle of the second weakness (Chap- ter 6) • the avoidance of typical mistakes (Chapter 17) In this chapter we are now going to deal with aspects of the conversion of an advantage that we have not already covered elsewhere, such as transformation of one advantage into another, space advantage, widening the operational front and material advantage. A) Transforming One Advantage into Another This is a very important aspect of the conver- sion of an advantage. In the higher sense, the whole game of chess can be regarded as the transformation of one advantage or equilibrium into another. From the point of view of the at- tacker, it is above all a question of being able to make progress. You cannot just obstinately sit on an advantage but must always keep an eye open for possible transformations. Nothing is harder than winning a won game.
SAVIELLY TARTAKOWER
As with many of his now famous aphorisms, Tartakower was of course consciously exagger- ating when he said this. Nevertheless there is more than a grain of truth in his words, since converting an advantage is indisputably one of the most difficult themes in chess. We can all cite dozens of examples in which we have ru- ined a favourable endgame and only drawn. To understand better how to convert an ad- vantage in a masterly and technically clean manner, it is first of all necessary to consider why so many so-called 'won endings' are in practice not won. At this point let us hand over to two other chess writers. In his book Practical Endgame Lessons. Edmar Mednis gives five golden rules to ensure that you do not win your won games. Here is his slightly tongue-in-cheek list: • Be careless. Don't expect your opponent to have any tactical threats. • Go for the prettiest continuation - it is bound to win. • Don't worry or work too hard - the game will win itself.
[diagram]
• Give up material. In his book Technique for the Tournament Player, Mark Dvoretsky dealt with the princi- ples for converting an advantage. He gave the following typical sources of error as the causes of problems in converting an advantage: • Exhaustion towards the end the game • Failure to keep your nerve • Time-trouble • Inadequate knowledge of endgame theory • Poor technique (allowing unnecessary coun- terplay, rushing, wrong exchanges)

Especially if it is not possible to make fur- ther progress, since your forces are already well placed, opening the position at the appropriate moment can be more important than retaining a completely unspoilt structure.

A3) Returning Material If you are absolutely sure that the resulting endgame is won, returning some material can sometimes simplify the task considerably. But extreme caution is indicated in such cases. Not for nothing is there a section in Chapter 17 ('Typical Mistakes') with the heading 'Unnec- essarily Giving up Material'. White is structurally better, but can make no further progress by static measures. So Suetin decides to open the queenside: 1 c4?I

lb have more space is not an advantage in itself. It can even happen that advanced pawns leave weak squares behind them, which the opponent can exploit. In the endgame, however, the proba- bility that the possession of more space is an ad- vantage is high, since there are no longer so many forces available for a counter-attack.

B2a) An Extra Pawn The following scenario is absolutely typical for the endgame in general, even though the rule of thumb applies above all to rook endings: for the conversion of an extra pawn in a rook ending with pawns on both wings. Fine gives the fol- lowing formula in Basic Chess Endings: If the defending king is on the wing with an equal number of pawns: 1) Place the rook and the king on the best possible squares. 2) Advance the pawns on the other wing as far as convenient. 3) Create an outside passed pawn. If the defending king is on the side with the extra pawn, then you can often win by penetrat- ing the other wing and plundering the pawns there.

B2) Material Advantage Normally two healthy extra pawns are suffi- cient to win, all other things being equal. How- ever, pure bishop endings and rook endings have a strong drawing tendency, so that the at- tacker should be very cautious about allowing exchanges. In Chapter 4 ('The Right Exchange') we have already seen that the general rule of thumb is: the attacker exchanges pieces and the defender pawns. We have discussed in the pre- vious section the transformation of one advan- tage into another by returning material. In what

16 The Art of Defence
Defence demands great courage and great self- control.
EMANUEL LASKER
Defence is an essential component of chess. Anyone who seriously strives to master chess must learn the art of defence. Without the abil- ity to defend tenaciously, resourcefully and sometimes patiently, waiting for your chance for hours at a stretch, success in many posi- tions is simply not possible. From the psychological point of view, in chess it is much more difficult to defend than to attack, since the freedom of action of the de- fender is usually limited in many respects. Normally he has to follow the path prescribed for him by his opponent and thus he often has to make forced moves and concessions. When a game follows this course it frequently leads, especially with young and inexperienced play- ers, to a weakening of fighting spirit and con- centration and thus errors are likely. It is no accident that it is in disadvantageous defen- sive positions in particular that the most blun- ders are committed. Therefore, you need to make sure that if you find yourself on the defensive you stay espe- cially alert. Always believe that there will be a way out - you actually always get at least one little opportunity. Pay attention first and fore- most to the concrete calculation of variations. Always try to present your opponent with the greatest possible difficulties in converting his advantage. Make concessions to the opponent only if there is absolutely no way to avoid them. Before we examine some practical exam- ples, we would like once again to alert you to some possible thematic overlaps with other chapters. In particular we have already exam- ined some important aspects of defence: the 'fortress' theme was talked about in Chapter 11, 'stalemate' in Chapter 12, 'counterplay by activating the king or the rook' in Chapter 1, 'defensive power of the bishop-pair' in Chap- ter 9 and 'exchanging pawns as a defensive idea' in Chapter 4. A) Defend Actively The basic idea of every defence consists of first eradicating the defects of your own position and then ideally even to go over to the counter- attack. Therefore, even if you find yourself on the defensive, you should never give up think- ing about your own active possibilities. Also on purely psychological grounds an active defen- sive strategy is advantageous. Your opponent will generally have substantially more difficul- ties if he also has to always take into account your active possibilities. It is almost always fatal, especially in posi- tions with serious structural weakness, to be completely reduced to passivity. In such cases it can often even be advantageous to give up the weakness that the opponent is besieging at an appropriate moment, in order to become active. Usually then the pieces which previously were occupied exclusively with defence develop a hitherto unimagined activity. The following ex- ample demonstrates such a case (see diagram on next page). White should abandon the weakness at a3 and activate his long-range bishop.

even must, be defended passively (mostly when there are only a few pawns left on one wing). On the other hand there are also positions that re- quire the defender to wait patiently for the ap- propriate moment to begin counterplay. But there are a large number of cases in which the defending side lost his nerve, impulsively made a last active attempt and, after this was re- pulsed. found himself in a resignable position. B) Prophylaxis in Defence Try to figure out the opponent's plans and foil them, before it is too late.

This example is clear testimony to the most important rule of thumb of the defender: you should never collapse into panic and must al- ways believe that there is a way out.

17 Typical Mistakes
The mistakes are all there, waiting to be made.
SAV1ELLY TARTAKOWER
"I was totally winning!" "I'm so stupid; that was completely drawn!" "One more good move and he would have immediately resigned!" If we are honest, each of us has complained some time in this sort of way to our team-mates, la- menting a missed opportunity or a stupid blun- der. For some of us, moaning like this might be a way of coping successfully with our frustra- tion. However, this generally does nothing to help us avoid making similar mistakes in the fu- ture. Instead of trying to elicit the sympathy of your team-mates, it is considerably more prof- itable to ask yourself about the reasons for your mistakes, to think about whether you have par- ticular weaknesses (psychological, physical or chess-educational) which are responsible for these mistakes and to consider how (not if!) you can eliminate them. In this chapter we shall cat- alogue typical mistakes and their causes and thus make our contribution. A) Deficient Knowledge of Endgame Theory The successful conversion of a superior position or the precise defence of an inferior endgame very often requires liquidation into theoretical known positions. It is obvious that in such situ- ations a deficient knowledge of endgame the- ory can be the cause of fatal mistakes. How can you expect to reproduce in a few minutes at the board, just by calculating variations, the same analytical work that famous endgame theorists achieved over several centuries? We warn readers: to avoid mistakes in this area it is not sufficient just to have examined the relevant theoretical positions once, super- ficially. It is absolutely essential to become so familiar with them that you can actually repro- duce and apply your knowledge off pat in each situation, even when short of time. But as so often in chess, mere knowledge alone is not enough; it is of critical importance, at the criti- cal moment, to be able to remember it. And the probability that you can manage to do this is all the greater, the better you have studied end- game theory. In Dvoretsky's Endgame Manual, Mark Dvor- etsky says that there are about eighty relevant theoretical positions which every player should know. We recommend that readers put together a database of these positions and study this 'Endgame-ABC' regularly, similarly to what you already do perhaps with a favourite open- ing variation. Let us now consider a practical example. We can safely assume that both players pos- sessed the necessary endgame knowledge to solve the problems of the position. But at the critical moment, under pressure and possibly in time-trouble, neither player succeeded in applying their theoretical knowledge.

This sins against the principle that you should not rush, since the d6-pawn cannot be saved in any case; it also allows the activation of the black king, so that Black is now able to reach Centurini's famous drawn position.

B) Carelessness / Loss of Concentration 'It's a game of 90 minutes' , goes the old soccer adage and in the metaphorical sense this natu- rally also applies to a game of chess. Humans are not machines and it is obvious that towards the end of an energy-sapping struggle you will feel tired. It is therefore imperative that in the final phase of the game you mobilize once again all your reserves of energy and concentration. There are innumerable examples in which one of the players became tired towards the end of a game. We urge our readers to take care, as tacti- cal possibilities often arise in apparently harm- less positions. Let us see what happened in the following game [see diagram on next page). With his dangerous passed pawn on e3, Black is clearly winning, since White can no longer stop the pawn. However, White's last move has set a fiendish trap.

White is glad to see this, since the pawn is weaker here than on h7 and White can also, as necessary, exchange it much more easily. Black definitely had to chance 8...a5 here. 9*d3! With the powerful threat of Qxd5. The im- mediate 9 Q>xd5?? would fail to 9...Bd8 -+.

J) Following Rules of Thumb Too Mechanically Tarrasch's old rule of thumb, that a rook be- longs behind a passed pawn, whether your own or the opponent's, is surely one of the most helpful of its type. But actually there are many exceptions (see following diagram').

18 Rules of Thumb
The most implacable rules in chess are - the ex- ceptions.
SAVELLY TARTAKOWER
In this book we have repeatedly emphasized important principles and rules for your general guidance. For a better assimilation and as a mo- tivating summary of what you have learnt from studying this book, we would now like to bring all these separate rules of thumb together here. If you are familiar with all these rules, and know where and how to apply them, then we congratulate you on already being a pretty strong player. If you are uncertain about any of these rules, however, then please refer once more to the appropriate chapter and study the relevant examples. There is a saying that every rule has its ex- ception and obviously this also applies to chess. We advise you therefore that these rules should be treated only as broad guidelines, which are admittedly helpful in the vast majority of cases, but please bear in mind that even the best rule is worthless without a corresponding calculation of the variations. A) 20 Golden Rules of the Endgame 1) An endgame is not a middlegame. 2) Activate your king. 3) Fight to the death. 4) Do not rush (unless you're in a race), 5) Normally each exchange benefits just one of the players. 6) If you are material up you should ex- change pieces; if you are material down ex- change pawns. 7) If you have the advantage, you should retain pawns on both wings. 8) Passed pawns must be pushed. 9) Passed pawns should be blockaded by the king or by a knight. 10) The rook is very strong on the counter- attack. However, it is not a good blockader of enemy passed pawns. 1 1) Rooks belong behind passed pawns, your own or the enemy's. 12) Pure opposite-coloured bishop endings have an extremely strong drawing tendency. 13) Rook endings also have a considerable drawing tendency. If you are in a worse position therefore think very carefully before you ex- change the last rook. 14) Isolated and doubled pawns are weak and should generally be avoided. 15) The bishop-pair is a powerful weapon. 16) In the endgame each mistake can be the last; therefore the value of each move is very high. 17) If you have no pawns left, you generally need to be at least a rook up to be able to win. 18) Wing pawns are often more valuable than centre pawns, since they can divert the oppo- nent more. Rook's pawns are often especially dangerous against a knight; in other endgames they are usually less valuable. 19) Memorize the draw with bishop and wrong rook's pawn. 20) Study your opponent's moves carefully. Ask yourself what he is threatening or plan- ning, and think prophylactically. B) Rules of Thumb 1) Always improve the position of your worst-placed piece. 2) Always try to limit the activity of the en- emy pieces. 3) Improve especially the position of your strongest piece (in the following order of prior- ity: queen > rook > king > minor piece).
282 HOW TO PLAY CHESS ENDGAMES
4) The fewer pieces there are remaining on the board, the more important is the position of the king. 5) The more pieces there are remaining on the board, the more insecure is an exposed king. 6) Not all routes of the king to a certain goal are equivalent. Don't forget the ideas of the bodycheck and the Reti manoeuvre. 7) Rook endings occur in practice with great frequency. Study them precisely. 8) Fight for the initiative. 9) If you make material or structural con- cessions in the fight for the initiative, then make sure that your initiative is lasting and sustain- able. 10) Opposite-coloured bishops favour the side with the initiative. 11) In endgames with knights, the initiative and control often play very important roles. 12) If your advantages are of a dynamic na- ture and threaten to disappear in the near future, then you should play actively and concretely and not flinch from sacrificing material, if necessary. Naturally this applies in the middlegame even more strongly than in the endgame. 13) A weakness is a pawn or a square that can no longer be protected by a friendly pawn. Often a weakness does not occur in isolation but as part of a whole weak colour-complex. 14) A weakness is only real if it can be ex- ploited. 15) The enemy pieces guarding a weakness must be exchanged. 16) The principle of the second weakness is of great importance. 17) When attacking, always look for possi- bilities to open a second front or to create an ad- ditional weakness. 18) If you have many static weaknesses in your own camp, you should generally not play purely passively but should instead strive for the initiative, to keep the opponent occupied, so that he can't calmly lay siege to your weaknesses. 19) In the endgame, a wrong exchange is of- ten impossible to put right. 20) With exchanges, what matters is what stays on the board and not what disappears. 21) With an exchange into a pawn ending, the pawn ending must be calculated to the end. 22) The queen is particularly strong if it has many targets to attack and if the enemy king is insecure. Static positions in which everything is protected do not suit the queen. 23) The most important criterion for the ex- change of queens is generally the situation of the kings. 24) If you are promoting a pawn into a queen, be especially alert. The promotion of a pawn is often a critical moment at which mis- takes occur. 25) If both sides queen simultaneously, then the side that can give the first check often wins. 26) Don't play on the wing where the oppo- nent is stronger. 27) If your opponent is in a static position without counterplay, then strengthen your posi- tion as much as possible before striking the de- cisive blow. 28) If you have enough time, take advantage of every possibility of improving your position, even if you cannot yet work out any concrete benefits from doing so. 29) Think schematically and consider how to achieve your target positions and dream po- sitions. 30) With a repetition of moves you can show who is boss. 31) Pawns cannot move backwards. Think carefully about each pawn move. 32) Passed pawns must be pushed. 33) In a race between passed pawns, what counts is not the quantity but the quality of the passed pawns. 34) Connected passed pawns are very pow- erful. If they have reached the sixth rank, a rook alone cannot stop them. 35) If the king can support a passed pawn, this is generally an advantage. 36) A queenside pawn-majority is favour- able for creating an outside passed pawn. A kingside pawn-majority is an advantage in the attack on the king. 37) The more pawns there are remaining on the board, the more potential breakthrough ideas there are too. 38) Knight endings are like pawn endings (Botvinnik's rule).
RULES OF THUMB 283
39) In bishop endings, take into consider- ation the principle of one diagonal. 40) Capablanca's rule for same-coloured bishop endings says that you should place your pawns on squares of the colour not controlled by the bishop. In that way they complement each other and the pawns cannot be attacked by the enemy bishop. However, under favourable conditions, the reverse can also be correct: by setting up a solid pawn-formation on the colour of the enemy bishop, you can sometimes re- duce it to complete passivity. 41) Queen and knight are a better attacking pair than queen and bishop (Capablanca's theo- rem). 42) Rook and bishop work together better than rook and knight (Fischer's endgame). 43) If you have the bishop-pair, try to gain control and then open the position on your terms. 44) One advantage of the bishop-pair lies in the fact that you have better possibilities of ex- changing. 45) Sometimes two bishops are so strong that they compensate for a rook and a knight. 46) Zugzwang represents a powerful end- game weapon. 47) Triangulation manoeuvres and spare moves are the main weapons for winning a zugzwang duel. 48) Stalemate is an important theme in de- fence. Always keep it in mind. Don't be too proud to set your opponent a last stalemate trap. It can be well worthwhile. 49) Always remember that mating patterns can also appear in the endgame. 50) Two rooks on the seventh rank are very powerful. If they are assisted by the king or a pawn on the sixth rank, they are generally deci- sive. 51) If you find yourself on the defensive, al- ways believe that your inferior position can still be defended. 52) Setting up an impregnable fortress is an important defensive idea. When appropriate, try to think about fortress ideas. 53) Passive positions hold the seed of defeat. 54) Defend actively. 55) Study thoroughly the theoretical end- ings that are most relevant to actual practice. 56) Stay alert right to the end. 57) The important thing is to win, not to win prettily. 58) Don't resign because of variations that you've worked out in your head; always make another couple of moves. 59) Don't give up material without good reason. 60) Moments when the character of a posi- tion substantially alters are critical moments at which mistakes frequently happen. This ap- plies to the moment when an endgame arises. 61) Make only those concessions to your opponent that are absolutely unavoidable. 62) You should never give way to panic and must always believe that there is a way out. If you sin against this rule, then all the other rules and principles will not help you in the slightest. 63) No rule can substitute for concrete cal- culation - all 'rules' have exceptions. The cal- culation of variations in the endgame is at least as important as in the middlegame. 64) The art lies in finding the exceptions, but you are already a very strong player if you know the principles and understand where and how they are to be applied.

Z.Milev - R.Byrne Varna OL 1962 lg5? This probably throws away the win, and is at the very least poor technique. The point is that Black still has the spare move ...aS. The correct plan for White consists of bringing his king to b2 and, by playing a3, forcing the reply ...a5. Then White plays a4, which completely seals the queenside and deprives Black of his spare move. Another disadvantage of the pawn-for- mation with ...a5 for Black is that in some cir- cumstances the white knight can attack the pawn via e7 and c6. So if the white knight is at f5, ... gS is no longer possible for Black. This manoeuvre should definitely have been carried out, even if it was not clear whether it was ac- tually necessary: 1 Ne3 *f8 2 Nd2 Nf7 3 Nc2 *f8 4 *b2 *f7 5 a3 a5 6 a4 *f8 7 Nc2 St?f7 8Nd3 *f8 9*e4*f7(9...'g?g8 102)e7+ +-) 10 *f4 *f8 11 g5 fxg5+ (ll...*f7 12 *g4 *f8 13 g6 +-) 12 *xg5 Nf7 13 Nh6 *f6 14 2>g3 +-.

Khalilbeili - Volovich Moscow 1964 First White should achieve the a4 advance, without allowing the black bishop to come to h6. This can be done by either Nd3-c2-b2 fol- lowed by a4. or l3?f3-g3-h4-g5 followed by _&cl and a4. After a4 there are two possibili- ties: a) If Black captures on a3, then White plays g5. after which the invasion of the queenside with Na4 and the threat of .a5-d8-e7 is deci- sive. b) If Black waits and allows the a4-pawn to live. White brings his king to g5, compels the black king to remain on the queenside on ac- count of the a-pawn and, after a bishop sacrifice on c5, forces his way through to the black f- pawn with Nh6. 1*13 Or: a) 1 *f4??Jih6+ 2g5 (2*f3 Nxe3 3*xe3 g5=)2...Nf8=. b) 1 *d3 *b6 2 *c2 *a5 3 *b2 *b6 4 a4 and White wins as in the game.

Muller and Pajeken focus on the practical side of playing endgames. They cover all aspects of strategic endgames, with particular emphasis on thinking methods, and ways to create difficulties for opponents over the board. Using hundreds of outstanding examples from modern practice, the authors explain not only how to conduct 'classical' endgame tasks, such as exploiting an extra pawn or more active pieces, but also how to handle the extremely unbalanced endings that often arise from the dynamic openings favoured nowadays. All varieties of endgames are covered, and there are more than 250 exercises for the reader, together with full solutions. Major topics include: • Basic Principles and Methods • Activity • Schematic Thinking • The Fight for the Initiative • Prophylaxis and Preventing Counterplay Grandmaster Karsten Milller is a world-renowned expert on all aspects of endgame play. He is co-author (with Frank Lamprecht) of the acclaimed Secrets of Pawn Endings and Fundamental Chess Endings. He finished third in the German Championship in 1996. and was runner-u in 1997.
