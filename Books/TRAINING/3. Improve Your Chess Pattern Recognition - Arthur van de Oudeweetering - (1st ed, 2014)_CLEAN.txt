Foreword by lan Rogers Most players begin to recognize standard combinational themes through puzzle books. But acquiring a knowledge of positional concepts which set up those com binations is harder to do. Players constantly ask 'The opening is over; what do I do now?' But apart from stop-gap principles like 'Improve your worst placed piece', the task of finding a suitable plan is a mystery to many. The 1980s volume Chess Middlegames, ghosted by Laszlo Hazai, covered multiple themes in 4,000 examples and was the finest reference book of its type. However the book is languageless, so a player needed to be dedicated to begin to understand the connections and differences between, say, the 1 00+ examples of both strong and weak isolated queen's pawn positions. Into the breach steps Arthur van de Oudeweetering, who has not only collected hundreds of examples, mostly recent, to illustrate many important middlegame themes, but has also provided new terminology to assist in the recognition of each pattern. This book is not just a worthy new middlegame treatise but one which is fun to read. As a new chapter begins you think 'Whatever does he mean by "Inside the Chain", or "Fishing for the Hook"?' But enlightenment follows soon. After reading Improve Your Chess Pattern Recognition, a player will no longer miss opportunities to become a Bishop Snatcher or use the Second Option for their rook. You will also become more aware of obstacles preventing you from winnin g without opposition; if you have a Bulldozer you willlook out for your opponent's Runn er. Van de Oudeweetering's coverage of the Killer Knight would probably find fa vour with Kasparov who, before the age of computers, was rumoured to have de veloped a sophisticated piece valuation system based in part on how close to the opposing king a knight could be posted. In fact after I'd absorbed IYCPR it was easy to speculate that Caruana's loss to Carlsen at the 2014 Troms0 Chess Olympiad could have been caused by the Italian overvaluing his Octopus. (This is not a phrase I ever thought I would find myself writing.) Once the reader has started applying the patterns in IYCPR in their own games, they will fmd that the post-opening phase of the game becomes easier and they will more often build up a strong position. Then comes the difficult part- convert ing that strong position into a win, as happens in most of the examples in IYCPR. For that, you need tactics training as well, though fortunately there are dozens of books which cover that territory.IYCPR, however, is one of a kind. Ian Rogers September 2014 7 Preface Plenty of scientific books have been written about pattern recognition; this will not be one of them. Sure enough, this book is about patterns, but it's mainly about chess. Another thing that should be clear from the start is that you will not encounter tactical patterns here, like for instance all kinds of mate images. In this book you will find predominantly positional patterns. Finally, it must be said that this book is about the middlegame. Sometimes a pat tern will be more easily explained in the endgame, because there are less disturbing factors in the form of other pieces there. These may well spoil the point you are try ing to make. Take for instance the rule that opposite-coloured bishops favour the at tacker when the major pieces are still on the board. In the manuals and articles dealing with this subject you are not likely to see many positions where the knights are still on the board. After all, in many cases this would diminish the influence of the opponent's bishop, which otherwise would have a monopoly on the squares of one particular colour. Still, in this book, now and then you will find an example of a certain pattern in the endgame. After all, the boundaries of the middlegame are not always crystal clear - at least not to me. Romanovsky, for instance, has pointed out that major piece endings also bear a middlegame character, due to the vulnerability of the kings. Also, sometimes a reference is made to a theoretical opening line which fea tures the pattern under discussion; for example the 'Lost Bishop' in the Russian De fence (9 . ... �xa2!?). The 'No-Nonsense Bishop' even features primarily in all kinds of openings, where this way of developing it has become remarkably popular. Of the patterns I have selected for this book, many consist simply of one and the same piece placement, like a white bishop on d6, splitting the enemy camp in two ('The Beastly Bishop'). Another pattern is where one and the same move counter intuitively creates a weak square, but at a closer look turns out to bring a lot of ben efits as well (for instance, in 'Never Mind the Holes', where ... a7 -aS leaves behind a backward pawn on b6 and a weak square on bS). The plain image of these 'one movers' may easily help you during the game to hit on the idea. Only in the final part, some more complicated patterns are discussed: manoeuvres (for example ... Rh8/ ... l:lg8/ ... g7-g5- the Nievergelt Manoeuvre) or a more general concept like offside pieces (which I've indeed called 'Offside Pieces') or a characteristic bat tle evolving in a specific pawn structure. This book is not what your ordinary positional chess or middlegame strategy book would look like. Usually, such works start off with broader concepts like attack and defence, bishop against knight, open lines etcetera. And then along the way they go into more detail. These boo ks "ill(hopefully) supply you with valuable knowl edge and understanding. At the sm1e time it is well known that during a real game Improve Your Chess Pattern Recognition your decision-making is influenced by the knowledge of patterns you have acquired. So why not study the middlegame in that way? I remember vividly that I suddenly started to s�e possibilities for exchange sac rifices in my own games after I had collected and studied material on this theme for a training session. Of course, before that I had been aware of the concept of the exchange sacrifice, but somehow the actual moves had become more con crete in my awareness. So I hope that after you have played through the seven (repetition is the mother of learning!) 'Bishop Snatchers', you won't miss any 'Rook takes bishop e6' in your own games any more. Moreover, you will have gained a good impression of the ideas and patterns in the starting positions and the resulting ones. A pattern is no road to immediate success, but it is a good start to get a good idea. After that, the other factors of the position have to be assessed and calculations have to be made. Much more can be said about chess pattern recognition in general, but I will only touch on one practical aspect here. In order to find examples from my database I used the option of mirroring positions vertically or horizontally. With this method I was able to discover the same pattern albeit in different pawn structures from other openings. Somehow this does change your perception slightly. Also, even a simple change of colour can do weird things with your mind. Jonathan Tisdall gives a typical example in his very enjoyable book Improve Your Chess Now. After l.c3 eS 2.c4ltJf6 we would automatically condemn 3.d3 as pas sive, he says, and I agree. But with reversed colours it is the start of the Najdorf Sicil ian. How to deal with that? Another thing he mentions on this subject is that GM Julian Hodgson regularly tried to gain new insights into certain positions by set ting them up with colours reversed. A very interesting method! Indeed, when Jobava plays the Philidor with white (l.e4 eS 2.ltJf3 ltJc6 3. ..Be2), how will both players approach and value the position? Also Ljubojevic-Larsen, Tilburg 1981, springs to mind: l.e4 c6 2.d3 g6 3.d4. But enough of this, I am losing my way inside another kind of pattern. Of course, if you start with such a broad concept, you can pick from a wide range of subjects. Although a couple of the subjects in this book will be more 'regular' or in any case more familiar to the experienced player, I have focussed on the patterns which carry an element of surprise or are preferably 'against' the basic positional rules you have learned. This means that in order to really appreciate these patterns you should have some basic knowledge about the rules of development, pawn structure and strong/weak squares. On the other hand, with these subjects I have often also included an example where the general rules did prevail. Just like there are no rules without exceptions (= some of the patterns in this book), there are certainly no patterns without exceptions. Which means that there are no universal solutions. Either the basic rules of chess still interfere or the circumstances differ. Take also the simple fact that two patterns from this book can occur in one and the same position, for instance a 'Killer Knight' versus a 'Beastly Bishop'. Preface Furthermore, writing on a subject in the first place was often induced by a topical game that attracted my attention. Some pattern caught my eye and made me think of a famous game from the past, or a game of my own. Pattern recognition, you could say. Generally, a search in the books and databases soon yielded other exam ples. I have tried to avoid using too-well-known examples from the past which have been used in (too?) many text books. Occasionally you will find one though, for example when there is an apt comparison with a topical game. However it would be silly not to refer to them in the text, as the pattern will ring a bell for many of you. (To aid your memory and make it easy for you, you can find these games in a separate online gamefile on the New In Chess website under www. newinchess.com/avdo/pattern.zip.) Thus, the majority of games will be from recent years. I did however include some lesser-known older games, simply because I like to put things in a historic perspective. Originally all these chapters were written for the online magazine ChessVibesTraining in 2012 and 2013. I would especially like to thank Merijn van Delft for persuading me to start writing for the magazine in the first place, and Peter Doggers for his support all along. For this book the articles have been thor oughly revised and updated. I doubt whether it will help you in practical play, but to give this book more structure, the patterns have been divided into four Parts: - The first one, 'Typical Piece Positions'. focusses on typical, mostly strong, spots for pieces. One is more conunon than the other. You may have heard about the power of a knight on f5 versus a castled king ('The Killer Knight'), but the Octo pus (a white knight on d6) will be less well known. (In fact, I doubt whether it has obtained any special attention in any book thus far.) - The second part contains several counter-intuitive moves: recaptures, exchanges, sacrifices, etcetera. - Some of these could also fit into the third part, which I have called 'Typical Stra tegic Means: Sacrifices'. Indeed this part deals with a wide variety of long-term positional sacrifices. However, I decided to differentiate between sacrificing by capturing something and more surprising silent sacrifices. - In the fourth and final part I discuss a number of broader concepts: not certain typical squares for pieces or typical moves, but characteristic manoeuvres or lit tle plans which consist of more moves. The last chapter ( 40) deals with the pawn structure from the practically decisive 9th World Championship match game in Chennai 2013, which saw a characteristic race between pawns on the king- and the queenside. I'm sure you can think of lots of other pawn structures and plans to be dealt with in the same manner, but that would be another book. Have fun with this one and I hope you also enjoy the exercises!

1100....JJiiaa66?? iiss aa mistake here!
mistake here! Chapter1 A Very Powerful Piece: The Octopus A knight in the heart of the enemy's position, aiming at both the kingside and the queenside, paralysing the opponent's pieces. Sounds good, doesn't it? Such a knight is sometimes referred to as an octopus, comparing its eight legs to the eight squares that the mighty knight controls. Chess history has seen some famous examples of superb knights on d3 or d6. Think for instance ofRobert Byrne-Fischer, USA-ch 1 96 3 , or Kasparov's impressive victory over Karpov in the 1 6th game of the World Championship match in 1 985. These games can be found annotated in several sources; here we will look into some more recent examples, and consider a few different aspects of the theme. Exchanging the Relevant Bishop First of alllet us see how White may create a home for the octopus: Hrant Melkumyan Evgeny Postny Sarajevo 20 1 2 1 .d4 d 5 2.c4 dxc4 3.tt::l f3 tt::l f6

just gives up the octopus for the bad bishop. But what really matters is the material that remains on the board. White has only transformed the charac ter of his advantage.

Summary So now you know an octopus when you see one ! There are vari ous typical means to create an octopus: exchanging the oppo nent's bishop which covers the octopus's entrance square, or tak ing care of the necessary pawn support. When the octopus has been put in position and it is dominating the opponent's pieces especially the rooks - . it will be of magnificent value. With less pieces on the board, the octopus is still a strong piece, but its in fluence is likely to be much less.

Chapter2 A Killer Knight A knight on fS (or f4) versus a casded king often exerts tremendous pressure. Gen erally such a knight must be challenged right away, before it will create strong threats with the support of other pieces. Let's investigate the power of yet another fearsome knight.

I think Kasparov has even said that a knight on fS nearly always justifies a pawn sacrifice. Be sure to remember the typical sacrifices , as well as the surprising recapture from the last exam ple when the knight is eliminated. Chapter3 (How to Get past) Nimzo's Strong Centre-Back Nimzowitsch's blockading knight on d6 is legendary. But which factors determine its strength in modern-day chess?

Summary 3 2 Apart from blockading a central passed pawn, a knight on d 6 may support advances by the nearby pawns to bS o r fS . Also it may attack the opponent's supporting pawn chain. The opponent should try to make something of his spatial advantage and watch out for being stuck with a bad bishop facing this ideal blockader. Chapter4 Dominating from the Edge: A Powerful Knight on aS Tarrasch's adage 'a knight on the rim ... ' has often been adapted by other people. But did you realize that, for example, a knight on aS can be a formidable piece in many cases? Indeed, there seem to be more exceptions to this rule than you would think. Wang Hao Magnus Carlsen Wijk aan Zee 20 1 3 The Tata Steel tournament in 20 1 3 sup plied a striking example: 'The Chinese Grandmaster traded his active knight for the passive black bishop, missing a clever defence .. .' When you read this in the round 1 1 report on the tourna ment's website, a position like the fol lowing one is hardly the first you would think o£ 1 .e4 c5 2.li:Jf3 li:Jc6 3.�b5 e6

Here White's knight is on the edge, while the black bishop, though it's not on the best possible diagonal, just seems normal. Even so, this was one of the rare moments during Tata 20 1 3 when Carlsen was in some trouble. Black has an unpleasant endgame. First of all,White controls the d-flle and also has the better pawn structure. A less no ticeable but important fact is that the knight on aS is better than the bishop on a6. The latter's scope is limited thanks to the white knight, which by contrast has access to some useful squares.

Here is another example of the typically annoying attack on the b7 -pawn. The pawn cannot advance as its colleague on c6 would fall. Black decides to castle queenside, protecting b7 in a natural way. However, this makes the knight on aS a dangerous footing for an attack on the black king.

So · 1 sug gest you use all the diagram positions as exercises and first determine whether you would decide on the capture your self before playing through the frag ments.

This means that Black's potentially dangerous bishop disappears from the board, as well as White's own bad bishop. Quite a good deal, you would think. Also, I have al ways been impressed by an early Kasparov game against Giorgadze, where White obtained a kind of Czech Benoni position with the light-squared bishops off - also from an l .e4 eS opening. However, in that game he had had to use a lot of tempi, playing c3-c4, tt:ld2-b l -c3 and ..tc2-a4 to achieve this. So how come this Ruy Lopez is not con sidered hugely advantageous for White?

Its relative value will be more than the tradi tional three points, unless the opponent manages to play around it, opening up files for his rooks. Chapter11 Edible or Forbidden Fruit? Never take on b2 with your queen, even when it is correct. Well, a lot of old and new opening theory tells a different story. And modern engines could not care less. Let's have a look at some daring queens. Good Old Development First a recent 'classic' , showing how it can go wrong.

It was 4-0 to me.' This huge lead in development, as a result of the time that the black queen needs to snatch the b2-pawn, is the classic reason why a capture on b2 is generally condemned. In his inspiring book Sacrifiu and Initia tive, Ivan Sokolov more than once uses the way of evaluating the position Giri uses here, referring to it as 'the attackers versus defenders ratio' . 5 ... 't!Rxb2 6.tt:Jbd2 'iVa3? I guess Bartel did not want to play . . .e7 -e6 before moving his light squared bishop outside the pawn chain, and now also wanted to avoid 6 .. . .1g4 7 .l:tb 1 .

As it happened, a young Magnus Carlsen was present in the local bookshop where this game was played. When my oppo nent asked for his verdict on the posi tion, it was clear from the expressi on on Magnus's face that he was not con vinced that the black queen could be successfully caught.

Chapter12 Out of the Box, into the Future Sometimes it requires imaginative prophylactic thinking or concrete calculations to arrive at a counter-intuitive decision. Let's clear our heads and learn from some im pressive examples. Eliminating the Bishop Pair We have had a look at White's elimina tion of the King's Indian bishop on c8 by transferring a knight to a7 (see Chapter 9 'The Deceptive Bishop from c8 ') . There are other, less standard occasions which require out-of-the-box thinking. Here is a recent example where an as tonishing defensive resource eluded such a strong player as Anish Giri.

1 6.'ifc4? Aronian's comments in New In Chess 2 0 1 2I 7 are revealing: 'A mistake. When immediately after the game Anish asked me where he had gone wrong, I pointed out to him that after 1 6. ti:Jd6 tt:Je8 1 7. tt:Jxc8 followed by the defence of the d-pawn White would have gained equality. Despite the fact that at the present moment the c8-bishop is not a very attractive piece, after Black plays e5 together with the b4-bishop it will become a powerful force.' That may sound simple, but I think for most of us it would be incredibly hard to decide on giving up our strong knight for the undeveloped bishop even if we had recognized its powerful hidden force. 1 6. .. tt:Jxe4 1 7.�xe4 'iit h8 1 8.�g2 K .i.

Over and above that, White's pair of bishops will become a force when the position opens up. With hindsight this may all sound very logical, but who would have been so clear-headed as to decide on lbd6xc8 so early? Kramnik slowly improved his pieces, secured his space advantage ... 1 6. ..

And Fischer was a pro tagonist of clear strategies: what remains is a strong white bishop against an inac tive knight on f6, while the white rooks control the c-file. The black pawns on a6 and d5 are still vulnerable and White willalways have the option of creating an outside passed pawn on the queen side.

When calculating exchanges, remember to also look what remains at the board. Chapter13 Never Mind the Holes Sometimes you have to give something to gain something. Makes sense, you might say, but in practice it is still a big step before you will seriously consider an ugly pawn move. Here we will consider a few typical pawn moves which create a back ward pawn and consequently provide the opponent with a strong square. Ugly and counterintuitive at first sight, but let's fmd out what the gains may be. Anatoly Vaisser Jean-Pierre Le Roux Nancy 20 1 3 1 .d4 · tt:lf6 2.c4 g6 3.ti:Jc3 d5

Le Roux, however, came up \\ith a different solution.
14. ..a51?
Of course, this move poses the direa threat of ...a5-a4, after which the d4-pawn would fall, but it also leaves big holes on b6 and b5 . I don't know whether Black thought up this move at the board, but either way it required some imagination! In the game it worked out quite well, though White certainly had his share of the chances. 1 5.a4 A natural retort, although 1 5 . �xc6 also came into consideration. After 1 5 . . .bxc6 White can play 1 6.O-O, with c5 now becoming a fine square for the knight (of course not 1 6.l:[xc6 �b7) . 1 5. .. ti:Ja7 This follow-up is equally original.

Apparently this move is an idea of Co mas Fabrego, who described exten sively how it came about in his book True Lies in Chess. He called the text move a 'conceptual novelty' . About this specific position he pointed out that 'it is not clear whether the b6-pawn is weaker than the a4-pawn' and that 'in some variations the b4-square could become an excellent outpost for the black queen' . In a similar position he also noticed that White can no longer avail himself of the standard plan a4-a5 . Black, on the other hand, can still go for a central attack with . . .e6-e5 . Thus there are a number of concrete considerations which may justify Black's permanent weakening of the queenside pawn structure. 1 6.h3 'fie7 Comas Fabrego expected later games to prove the viability of the idea, but few games have since featured 1 5 . . .a5 ! ? (for example, the recent game Leko-Wang Yue, Beijing 20 1 3 , saw 1 5 . . .h6 1 6.a5 ) . Here the game Baramidze-Bacrot, Bundesliga 20 1 3 , continued 1 6 . .. h6 and soon came to a peaceful conclu sion: 1 7 . .l:tab 1 'fie? 1 8.�b5 lt::J f6 (a typical reaction - see also the main game) 1 9.�d3 lt::J d7 20.�b5 lt::J f6 2 l .�d3 1/2-112. 1 7. .1:tab1 .1:tfd8 1 8.�b5 lt::J f6 Otherwise White will exchange the knight, further weakening b6. 1 9.'fid3 'fic7 20. .1:1b3 h6 Instead Comas Fabrego gives 20. . . 'fif4 as the strongest continuation, putting more pressure on the white pawn cen tre, for instance 2 l .g3 'iWh6 2 2.'it>h2 .l:tc 1 . After the text move, the game was eventually drawn as Beliavsky was un able to pose any problems to Black. I must say, I myself found Comas Fabrego's idea baffling. Yet it is doubtful whether we can speak of a conceptual novelty. For example, the following game will not have eluded attentive fol lowers of chess history.

Be sure to remember these examples, it will help you to keep an open mind when dealing with your pawn struc ture! Chapter14 Ignoring the Threat Sacrifices may occur at unexpected moments. One surprise factor is when a threat to gain material does not produce the logical response, but is answered by a coun ter-reaction which had not been anticipated at all. Countering in the Centre Let's illustrate this with some examples of exchange sacrifices. Of course, other types of sacrifice could serve as suitable illustrative material as well, but this seems like a good opportunity to have a look at the rich world of the exchange sac. After all,categorizing these sacri fices according to the type of compen sation gained always seemed to me a tough job as specific examples often show a complex combination of mate rial and positional factors.

A lot of popular open ings of course feature a doubled f-pawn. Think, for instance, of the Vienna Variation of the Queen's Gam bit, as well as the Najdorf and Rauzer Sicilians. There are also old variations like the Chigorin Defence, which pro duced a classic battle between the bishop pair (with doubled f-pawns) and a pair of knights in Lasker Chigorin, also from Hastings 1 89 S .

Improve Your Chess Pattern Recognition Chapter18 Towards the Edge On many occasions there are good reasons to take not towards the centre with a pawn, but towards the edge. lbis isn't exceptional - it's quite common practice. However, when there is a choice the general rule remains to capture towards the centre. Opening the f-File In this article we'll mainly look at the f-pawn, although of course other pawns also come into consideration. For exam ple, a regular capture towards the edge that springs to mind is ...d7xc6 in vari ous variations of the Ruy Lopez. In that case Black considers his pawn structure and piece development to be more im portant than having a central pawn.

1 1 .fxg31 There are no doubled pawns here, but this capture creates more pawn islands. On the other hand, it not only opens the f-file, but also renders Black's open h-file less significant. Black's plan could be to exchange the light-squared bishops and direct his queen to the h-file. With a pawn on h2 , which can easily be protected from f2 , this plan will likely be lesssuccessful than with the pawn on f2 instead. This is common knowledge in the Dragon.

Can we draw the same conclusions about doubled rook pawns? A Half-Open File An important difference is that the dou bled rook pawns obviously don't in crease control of the centre. They do, however, create a half-open file. In our first example the half-open g-file (yes, the same file that can be opened by doubling the f-pawns!) facilitates an at tack on the king.

Again White (mind you, he is a pawn up here!) purposefully allows the dou bling of the h-pawn, to avoid having his knight chased away after 9.lLlf3 e4. The importance of the weakened pawn structure is bound to be less when it's deliberately been allowed rather than inflicted by the opponent (for instance, by means of . . .h7-h5 -h4-h3 , with White responding gxh3) . No two dou bled rook pawns are the same! In this case Fischer's move also had sur prise value, since he reintroduced Steinitz's idea after a very long time.

White decides to centralize his queen, knowing that she will probably not be able to stay there. Besides, we have all learnt that the knight is the ideal blockader in such isolated queen's pawn positions.

Black has managed to exchange queens and has thus averted any immediate danger, but if we count Black's doubled e-pawns as one, as explained above, White is just a pawn up. He did indeed go on to win. 1 69

Summary A black pawn still on e 7 and Black's light-squared bishop traded off (or not in control of square e6) may be an invitation for White to sacrifice a pawn with e5-e6. The compensation offered will vary, but most of the time the black pieces will have a hard time before they can coordinate. 1 7 3 Improve Your Chess Pattern Recogni tion Chapter25 The Bishop Snatcher Sometimes a black bishop on e6 is surprisingly snatched away from the board by a white rook. We will only consider the long-term positional sacrifices, not the (short-term) tactical operation. This pattern - rook takes bishop on e6 - remains the same, of course, and this is what willhelp you to see the possibility in · your own games. The exchange sacrifice on e6 is in fact quite common. Let's study some typical characteristics and see where the compensation comes from.

Quite a lot: Black's queen remains out of play for a little longer and White's knight can jump to the central outpost on eS with out having to worry about being chased away by Black's f-pawn. White can set up a nice battery on the b l -h7 diago nal, where, also due to the move 1 74 ... h7 -h6, the light squares have been considerably weakened. Having said that, let's now play chess:

In this case, though, the isolated doubled e-pawns almost split Black's camp in two, and White's space advantage causes the black rooks to re main quite passive.

Summary Now this sacrifice vvillbe part of your 'chess education' along side the better known e..xchange sacrifice on c3 - the 'Knight Chopper' . It does occur in allkinds of positions. The opponent will end up v.ith a back.··w ard pavm, sometimes doubled and sometimes even isola ed. Often the sac also creates access to the kingside, pa,ing the ,-a · :or an arrack on the king. 1 7 9 Improve Your Chess Pattern Recognition Chapter26 King's Rook G rabs Knight l:htbf6 is a familiar positional exchange sac which often also targets the enemy king. Let's have a look at this mirrored version of the regular Sicilian exchange sac on c3 . Of course, a chapter could have been devoted to the latter as well. However useful that would be, that sac is more likely to be common knowledge. At the high est level Kasparov even suggested that Movsesian, after allowing . .

However, for those familiar with either this Nimzo line or the famous Griinfeld game Sakaev-Belov, the move won't come as a surprise.

But there's even more to the game posi tion: by bravely avoiding a move repeti tion Black has reached the exact posi tion of the famous game Anand-Wang Hao, Wijk aan Zee 2 0 1 1 (though strangely enough my ChessBase search options won't do the trick! ?) . This game revived interest in the knight sac, of which Timman says in an inter esting article devoted to the subject in New In Chess 20 1 1 /2 : 'As a rule you can say this knight sacrifice is onl)- suc cessful if Black's position leaYes some thing to be desired.' This is of course a rather general statement, which resem bles what Willy Hendriks ridicules as Chapter 2 7 - Central Avalanches 'free advice' in his book Move First, Think Later. Of course it is hard to pro vide general guidelines about when to execute this sac. So just remember the pattern and assess the possibility when it comes along!

Spassky's trainer Tolush admit ted: 'Spassky, acknowledging that his po sition was strategically lost, dedded on the piece sacrifice hoping to obtain chances to create counterplay.' Objectively the sacrifice is insuffident, but I couldn't resist including this example before re turning to the more trivial examples.

Tukmakov is among those who have explained that Geller was a brilliant attacker, but also disliked passive defence. Apart from that, he had trouble handling theoretical nov elties at the board, being himself a thor ough researcher.

Still, although the pawns are far advanced, things aren't so clear. The pawns won't easily advance any further, the black pieces have rea sonable squares and there is the possi bility of counter sacrificing on dS . In general, a counter-sacrifice can often be a valid antidote to a sacrifice. In this regard Eingorn mentions his game against Hodgson as an example. Even so, Black may consider other moves, like 1 6. ..exd5 1 7 . i.f4 and now, for ex ample, 1 7 . . .

My favourite Old Arkhangelsk often features strong pawn centres at a later stage - witness, for in stance, Mortensen-Shirov.

For now we willlook into another pattern: a long-term sac on h3 /h6 ! Maxime Vachier-Lagrave Richard Rapport Biel 20 1 3 • .i j_ 'iV i i .i. In this position Vachier-Lagrave was taken by surprise: 1 5. .. �xh3 1 6.gxh3 Weal You would expect such a bishop sac to be followed up with a rook check on the g-file or at least the queen sortie to h4.

'iff3 . . . and a draw was agreed after some bishop checks by Black. After the game Vachier-Lagrave declared that he had seen the possibility of 1 5 . ..�xh3 , but simply felt it could not be correct as White had so many op tions. So he underestimated his oppo nent's possibilities: but surely he was familiar with this kind of sacrifice?! The Classic Example When I saw the previous game, it did not immediately dawn upon me that Rapport's sacrifice had a very famous predecessor in the shape of a spectacu lar victory by Bronstein over Keres.

Romanovsky talks about the obscurity, the diffi culty and the riski ness of the sacrifice, and Kasparov calls it an uncommonly bold and pretty sacri fice. Valery Beim, on the other hand, says this about the next move: 'striking, al though this sacrifice is a quite routine idea, but here its correctness is question able at first, second and third glance! ' So where lies the truth? The idea is not unknown - it appears in Anderssen Morphy, I 85 8 , for one! Calling it a rou tine idea in I 95 5 with such a tense fol low-up as in the game seems a bit strong. This is what Bronstein himself said: 'the unexpected sacrifice of a bishop promises a very strong attack. After I 5 .'if d2 the white attack unfolds by itself' (The Sorcerer's Apprentice)

h7 Here Black's queen cannot join the de fence that quickly. Much of the debate over the years has been about I 5 . . . tLlc5 . As regards the correctness of the result ing variations, Kasparov's thoughtful comment seems most to the point: 'I do not rule out that White's play can be improved somewhere, but it is probable Chapter 2 8 - Fishing for the Hook that Black has sufficient defensive re sources. It is another matter whether anyone would be capable of fmding them at the board' (My Great Predeces sors, Volume II) . 1 6.llfxh6 f5 1 Vt::l xf5 l:(xf5 Vachier-Lagrave did not have this possi bility (but of course he had a safe way to draw earlier on) . 1 8.�xf5 tt::J f8 1 9.l:(ad1 �g5

Improve Your Chess Pattern Recognition Chapter29 The Colossal Knight Sometimes a knight is bluntly planted in the middle of the board, on the protected square dS - an offer Black can't refuse. This is a familiar sight in several openings. notably the Sicilian. Let's investigate how it works. Mind you, despite its powerful impression the sacrifice does not always guarantee immediate success. Open e-File: the King in Danger We start off with a quick success by one of my teammates in the Dutch competi tion, GM Roeland Pruijssers.

Here it serves to open up the e-file, after which the black king has no safe refuge. Still, the sacrifice may come as a surprise to you since for the moment Black has safeguarded the e-file with a doubled pawn. However, as you will see, soon Black's king willbe in trouble and a lot of black pieces will be hanging. My all-time favourite ex- 1 98 ample of opening up the e-file with long-term compensation is Stein Furman, Moscow 1 969.

Where a moment ago the black queen seemed to be actively participating in the pressure against the e4-pawn, now it seems hopelessly out of place, far away from the real activity.

Improve Your Chess Pattern Recogni ti on Chapter30 A Practical Piece Sac g2-g4 ti:Jf6xg4 h3xg4 �xg4. This sacrifice seems so narural: for a piece you capture two pawns in front of the enemy king with a strong initiative or a bind as a result. Still in many cases, as you might expect, the outcome is not clear at all. Let's see in which ways play may develop. A Different Start Most often the pattern will come about when White removes the pin on the f3-knight by advancing the g-pawn.

(on queen exchanges) 4 m <: 4 m <: Chapter31 The Nievergelt Manoeuvre No less a player than Bobby Fischer didn't shy away from using it unexpectedly. Where did it originate and how should you adopt it? You may well have encoun tered this manoeuvre or perhaps even be familiar with it (though probably not yet with the name) . Try to answer the question below and the manoeuvre we are about to investigate will soon be revealed.

Indeed, hardly the first move you would think o£ Prophylaxis against a possible knight sacrifice on e6, perhaps? 1 5.t2Jce2 :ga Ah, so this was the intended follow-up! 1 6.�h1 g5 And now the entire concept has be come clear. The idea is remarkable, both because the pawn structure in the cen tre isn't yet fixed and White could still launch a dangerous counterstrike there, and because the manoeuvre is also rather slow, taking three moves and with no direct attacking goal. In this particular case White is unable to come up with anything in the centre. In fact, here and on his last move Black could well have opted for . . .d6-d5 . Af ter completing his manoeuvre Black wants to follow up with . . .g5-g4, un dermining White's pawn centre, open ing the g-file and improving the scope ofthe �b7 . So how did Fischer arrive at this idea in the first place? We can only guess, of course, but it's at least perfecdy possible that he'd seen the idea before, not in this particular position but maybe in a slighdy different situation in a com pletely different opening. After all, it was known that he avidly studied all published games. 1 7.h3 .l:rg6 1 8.t2Jg3 J:lag8 1 9.t2Jxe6? So this game sees no real test of the idea

and Carlsen converted his material ad vantage. So here the king transfer did not work; it simply took too long, al lowing Black to expand his initiative. Of course, there are further examples where majestic manoeuvring did not produce the desired effect (check for instance Lupuluscu-Bologan, Greece 20 1 0, where White managed to open up the position of the enemy king) . Still, it remains a typical strategic means which should not be lightly discarded! Summary 2 2 6 B e sure t o remember the king can also b e a mobile piece in the middlegame!

Make sure that from there the queen controls an open, useful diagonal. Also remember the pretty preparatory king moves. Chapter34 The Second Option At the start of the middlegame the rook may often be a bit slow to enter the play. Pawns or pieces may still be in the way. This can be one of the reasons to advance a rook's pawn. But then sometimes there is another solution: the second rank.

Further more, on a more philosophical note, you could say that by disconnecting the rooks Black has rid himself of one su perfluous rook.

When we make a comparison to the more common rook lift along the third rank, one difference may be that the second-rank development often in volves slow positional strategy behind the pawns. Along the third rank the rook is likely to create more instant ac tivity in front of its own pawns. In general, rooks seem to cooperate more harmoniously when they are not on the same rank. When they are dou bled on the same (open) file, their co operation, as you will know, can be very fruitful, for instance when trying to in vade the enemy position.

Suba's seems to have been the most quoted example, also by Dvoretsky himself on chesscafe.com. Yet as far as I know Emms (in More Sim ple Chess) is the only writer who re ferred to an analysis by Timman in 1 9 7 5 . Timman recounts when he was a guest at Spassky's place one night after the tournament, together \\ith Ulf Andersson, enjoying vodka and �iar and playing through some games . . -\nd then he writes: 'Spas.sky uttered the opinion that it might b..a\ -e been;uhis able for White to exchange one of the knights because after the ten m<J'\t. . .

Though Timman proceeds by pointing out the drawback of 20.lbxf6, as it activates the dark-squared bishop, it is a fine example of what Dvoretsky was later to call superfluous pieces.

When the foremost knight is on an outpost and has to be exchanged, the second one can imme diately follow in its footsteps. Take, for instance, Vaisser-Golod, Maccabiah Je rusalem 20 1 2.

ttJbd5 Black voluntarily links his knights, but not without good reason. The knight on b6 is activated and centralized, chal lenging its active counterpart on c3 . 1 5.ttJb5 Naturall y White refuses to disentangle the knights. Tisdall's lively comment on the subject has been quoted in several places: 'the knights are never happy pro tecting each other. They step on each other's hooves, and reduce their own range' (from Improve Your Chess Now) . Here I would like to add: also in chess, never say never, as we saw in the previ ous example! Tisdall ends with: 'they are best employed side by side, when they can influence a virtual barrier of squares'.

As Emms noted, there are several theo retical lines which feature the avoidance of an exchange of a superfluous knight, such as the Closed Sicilian or the Chigorin Ruy Lopez. See the online da tabase file for the respective variations. Jussupow also pointed out the frequent occurrence of the phenomenon in posi tions resulting from specific openings. He mentioned the Dutch Stonewall. Here we have an example of that struc ture featuring some familiar elements. 1 2.tt:Jb1 !? Of course, here too Black was intending to exchange the foremost knight, be fore occupying e4 with the other one. Again, with all four minor pieces on the board Black suffers some spatial prob lems; as seen previously, White may fol low up with tLleS and f2-f3 . The draw back is that the knight on b I will be temporarily inactive (and in other cases this drawback may just turn out to be too serious!) , but here it may even assist the defence. There is also a very similar game in this line, Kharnak-Novkovic, Cappelle 2000, which featured a quick finish . 1 2. .. iVxa2 1 3.tt:Je5 tt:Jd7 Black redeploys his superfluous knight .

Just leave them standing in each other's way. Chapter 36 The No-Nonsense Bishop Move Putting the bishop in front of your undeveloped central pawn goes against general wisdom. Yet it is a practical approach which seems to be becoming more and more common. Clearly this pattern is connected to the opening phase of the game. Let us broaden the horizon of our general development rules and look into some typical openings and the straightforward ideas behind this move. Manuel Bosboom Sofia Polgar

A retreat to a square where the bishop blocks a central pawn and, as a result, in hibits White's further development. What is more, the bishop's diagonal is blocked by the e4-pawn. Despite these drawbacks, such moves are becoming common practice these days and there fore less of a surprise. In my database the text is about seven times lesspopular than S .�xd7+, yet, in the last two years. it has gained a staggering amount of ground, with players such as Carlsen, Caruana, Nepomniachtchi. S,idJer and Wang Yue resorting to it. So Bosboo m. known for his supposedly unconven tional ideas, may have been hitting the nail on the head here twenty years ago! White's general idea is to build a strong pawn centre with c2-c3 and d2-d4. If we compare the text move with S .i.e2 , then the natural S . . . tLlgf6 would attack the e4-pawn, rendering White's idea impossible. Of course, White's retreat preserves his pair of bishops. The loss of time is not problematic due to the fact that, for now, the position is closed. 5 ... tt:Jgf6 6.c3

Towards the Endgame With queens exchanged, the initiative gained for the damaged structure is likely to diminish, and the versatile knight can come in handy to lay siege Chapter 3 8 - A Double-Edged Exchange : �x<8c6 to the doubled pawns. A well-known example is Smyslov-Tal, USSR Ch 1 969, or you might take a look at Petrosian Nezhmetdinov, USSR Ch sf Tiblisi 1 949 (both ended in a knight vs bishop bat de, see the additional games) . Here, however, we have an example where the two bishops do manage to prevail, putting constant pressure on the black position (and, true, the extra c-pawn proves to be ofvalue here) .

With the queens on the board, a counterattack on the kingside can be a possibility. The pair of bishops should be activated as much as possible; also without the queens they can be a terrific force (see the Kosintseva game) . Chapter39 The Big Decision On what grounds should you decide on (or refrain from) an exchange of queens? Let's look into some recent examples and discover the various reasons. You will find that the reasons for deciding on an exchange of queens are often the same as for the exchange of any other piece. However, the exchange of queens is bound to have a big influence on the further course of the game. For one thing, the position will be steered towards an endgame.

Viswanatha.n Anand Magnus Carlsen Chennai 20 1 3 i i i ' � � � � � � � Cfj !1: � � � 'iV !1: � Clearly a battle is in progress on oppo site sides of the board. Here White will try to use his space advantage on the kingside and his central pawn majority to set up a kingside attack. Black will try to create a passed pawn out of his queenside majority. The latter plan seems obvious: prepar ing and then executing . . .bS-b4 will do the trick (in fact, Carlsen had just played . . .a7-a5). For White's attack we need more moves and imagination. Yet GM Erwin 1' Ami tweeted: 'Think today we see one of those few positions where the computer doesn't have a clue. I'd blindly take White.' And indeed it is al- ways attractive to mount a mating at tack which could immediately decide the game. On the other hand, whenever a passed pawn is created, promotion may still be far off. By the way, Erwin's remark about the computer is also interesting. suggesting that engines are not capable of making correct long-term assessments (or at least need considerably more time to do so) . So never rely solely on your en gines - feed them with your own ideas, and fmd out the hard way! 1 5.g5 tt::l e8 1 6.e4 tt::l xc1 Anand had just created space for his bishop to develop and Carlsen decided to swap it off, not wanting to be stuck with an out-of-play knight on b3 . In this regard you might want to look back at Zhao Xue-Harika Dronavalli, 20 1 2 , the first example in Chapter 3 7 on offside pieces. A move such as 1 6. .. tt::l c7 could still be considered as the queenside is likely to be opened up, after which the knight on b3 may be not that bad at all. After 1 7 . �e3 l:ta6 1 8 .eS b4 the situation is similar to the game, except White is one tempo slower, but his dark-squared bishop is still on the board. Again he Chapter 40 - The Runner and the Bulldozer will have to proceed with f3-f4-f5 , now or after exchanges on b4 and a6. 1 7.'ifxc1 .Ua6 1 8.e5 It is all about speed: who will be the first to have serious threats? One of the most difficult questions is deciding when to follow your own plan and when to hinder the opponent's plans. In this respect it is worth mentioning that Kasparov let the world know (via Twit ter, of course) that he would prefer 1 8 . .Ub2 . 1 8. .. tbc7 And here, on the same topic, Carlsen was considering 1 8 . .. g6 1 9. f4 tbg7 and now an exchange sacrifice after f4-f5 doesn't seem convincing, but Carlsen feared 'ifb 1 . In general, up to now, Black had avoided pawn moves on the kingside, which could speed up White's attack. If Black could really achieve a blockade on fS , it would be a different matter! 1 9.f4 b4 20.axb4 A lot will be written about the alterna tives 20.f5 lbbS and 20.a4, but Anand's idea of exchanging a defender (the :a6) will strike you as logical. 20 ... axb4 21 . .Uxa6 -Lxa6 22.f5 b3 Perhaps the climax of the st:raregic bar tie: the problem for Whire is th.ar his only remaining rook has to stay on the defensive to stop Black's passed b-pawn.

Again advancing the c-pawn beyond the opponent's centre to create a queen side majority, and as a result handing the opponent a pawn majority in the centre. In general this is not uncommon and can be seen in other openings like the Queen's Gambit, the Tarrasch Varia tion of the Queen's Gambit or the Ragozin (Cheparinov-Carlsen, World Cup 2005) . Most of the time, however, you will fmd that Black controls the e4- square, so White will have some trouble getting his pawn majority rolling. Here the concept seems quite daring, considering that White's e-pawn has al ready advanced to eS . Also note that earlier in this year Agdestein, among other things a former trainer of Magnus, had himself opted for the same 8 . . .c4 in the Nimzo-Indian that oc curred in the opening of our main game (Anand-Carlsen, 9th game) , against Bialek, Prague 20 1 3 . About I O.g4 in that game, he appears to have said: 'this is something Magnus has pre pared, we've looked at this together on the national team.' I wonder whether we are going to learn more about that!

Black turned out to be fine, with the lLlb3 eyeing the d4-pawn! Offside Knight vs Beastly Bishop Of course, there are other middlegame structures which feature races with kings on the same side of the board, for exam ple the Noteboom (Triangle) system - an overwhelming pawn centre versus two passed queenside pawns -, see for instance Hammer-Nakamura, Sandnes 20 1 3 , the queenside vs kingside attacks from the closed Sicilians in the Spassky Geller match from 1 965, etc ... For now, let us stick to the same pawn structure and consider ideas which illus trate the manoeuvring battle between White's dark-squared bishop and Black's queen's knight. Here is an old game be tween two strong players from the past.

Chapter 40 - The Runner and the Bulldozer Another Classic Mikhail Botvinnik Conel Hugh Alexander ENG-USSR radio match 1 946 We end with a classic example from an other former World Champion, Mikhail Botvinnik. 'Oh please no' , I hear you thinking, having looked at the diagram posi tion, not Botvinnik-Capablanca AVRO 1 9 3 8 again. And indeed it was this game which Giri referred to in a somewhat puzzling tweet: 'Magnus with his great memory no doubt re members Botvinnik-Capablanca 1 -0 :) Let's see if he can make use ofit! ' (The fact is that the then up and coming Botvinnik had about the same age dif ference with Capa as Carlsen with Anand, though with colours re versed.) But no. Had the bishop been on b2 in the dia gram position, then you would have been completely right! This position, however, stems from Botvinnik-Alexan der, Radio match 1 946 (no need for the internet in those days!) . And, as a mat ter of fact, Botvinnik had deviated from his previous classic by playing the same early a2-a4 and .Ba3 as in the former game.

Epilogue Having concluded my work on this book I kept running into new and old examples of the patterns discussed here. And in lots of different places: no matter if I was reading in an old Russian chess book, following a recent tournament or skipping through recent top games in a new The Week In Chess file. Of course, not every pattern occurs in the same frequency. You are more likely to detect a typical exchange sacrifice than an enclosed bishop. I could easily pick out some more examples of the former, for instance the Bishop Snatcher in Gupta-David, Rethymno open 20 1 4: 1 4. .. Jbe31? Or the 'Rook Takes King's Knight' in Bu Xiangzhi-Zhou Weiqi, Chinese Team Championships Jinan 2 0 1 4: O .i. .t .i. • 'i+' i i i ' · � � · � · � � � � if � � tb � � � � w 1 9.�xf61? Yet adding more examples to one and the same pattern in this book would be overdoing it and probably not be of fur ther help to you. Seeing the patterns recur is a nice thing in itself , and on occasion these exam ples did even cause me special pleasure. For instance when I saw Merijn van Delft, who is among others one of my former fellow columnists for the Chess Vibes Training Magazine, executing the following Bishop Snatcher against fellow countryman Martijn Dambacher in the European Club Cup 2 0 1 3 : 1 6.l::t xe6!? . . . which after 1 6 . . .fxe6 1 7 . tt::l e4 l::t f8 1 8 .�c l was promptly countered with 1 8. . .�xf3 ! ?. Let me give you one more striking ex ample. An offside piece is one of the most difficult patterns to recognize, as there is no specific square involved. Yet

. . . White was soon successful on the other wing. Books are also a good source of inspira tion and material. Reading in Judit Polgar's excellent second autobiograph ical book (From GM to Top Ten) I en countered yet another type of exchange sac, a 'silent one'. Not in the actual game though, but in her considerations during the game: Here 1 9.tLla4!? was played. Polgar adds the following comment: 'I felt that oc cupying the b6-square was more im portant than material. I also considered Epilogue 1 9. l:!.fb 1 ! ? followed by l:!.b6 sacrificing an exchange with similar ideas.' Indeed a familiar type of sacrifice which is also dealt with in this book. However, this time it wasn't actually played. Which again goes to show that recognizing a pattern does not always equal the only or correct solution. In the same book (Chapter 4) Polgar deals with 'Positional Sacrifices' , which is of course a much broader term than the patterns in this book. Yet, when compar ing two of her games against Karpov she draws some interesting and very specific parallels. Both games contain a knight sacrifice on the same square (dS) and yield a strong pawn centre for the sacri ficed material. In fact, in particular the game from Buenos Aires 2000 would have neatly fitted in this book's 2 7th chapter, on Central Avalanches. I am sure that if you carefully read other chess writers, you will also detect such fragments which are closely connected to pattern recognition. The number of patterns is by no means exhausted with the publication of this book. For the selection I have had to drop many, and meanwhile I keep run ning into other 'fresh' ones. Take this position from Maletin-Khismatullin, Izhevsk 20 1 4:

I recommend you to systematically save such examples when you encounter them and study the effectiveness of these patterns. After that you willbe more likely to hit upon a similar uncon ventional idea in your own games. In itself it is not strange at allthat I keep running into new examples of the patterns presented in this book (also, most of the exercises have been picked from tourna ments in 2 0 1 4) : I guess I have developed a sense of awareness for these patterns.

His youth in the chess-minded city of Apeldoorn brought him second place in the national youth championships under 1 6. Later (in 2003) he became an International Master, before shifting his attention to training. For several years Van de Oudeweetering has trained the Dutch federation's youth selection under 1 4 (today some of these selected players have become strong grandmasters) . He certainly benefited from his acquired experience with compil ing training material when he started to write a weekly column on the middlegame for the ChessVibes Training magazine, which eventually laid the foundation for this book. More recently Van de Oudeweetering has been writing a monthly column for Chess.com's Master's Bulletin. 3 0 1
