You can't live long enough to make them all yourself.' - Eleanor Roosevelt Background and motivation My endeavours in the world of endgames extend over a period of many years as a trainer, and represent a continued effort to help learners improve their skills in this all-important and all-decisive phase in a game of chess. Since the improving player often struggles to remember certain key ideas or manoeuvres, or - more often - fails to execute the acquired theoretical knowledge in their games, I have developed specific training methods designed to explain these positions in the clearest possible way. All too often have I witnessed the following tragic scenario unfold: a player, having learned a theoretical endgame by heart, becomes so confident that he assumes such a position can hold no secrets to him. But then he gets the position on his board in a tournament game - sometimes even the very next day after training - and disaster strikes. Interestingly, the decisive blunder is usually not a 'novelty', but rather a typical violation of endgame theory seen in some earlier game(s), occasionally even perpetrated by this or that decorated chess star. As Tartakower once famously remarked: 'All blunders are all there, waiting to be made.' Perhaps I am justified in adding an Orwellian twist to this and state that 'all blunders are equal, but some are more equal than others.' Database statistics certainly support this claim; some endgame positions reveal a much higher victim rate than others. Aspiring chess players, therefore, are well advised to become acquainted with these common pitfalls. In my experience, the best way to train these endgame positions is by solving exercises such as the ones in this book, as this approach greatly helps you recognize certain key ideas in your own games. The quote above, by the First Lady of former US president Roosevelt, is not meant ironically, but genuinely echoes my recommended approach to endgame study: seeing where and how others went astray greatly accelerates your own learning process. Therefore, besides carefully analysing the positions in this book, I would encourage you not only to examine any flawed play produced in your own games, but also to look at games of friends at your chess club or at other boards in the tournament, if you happen to be playing one. Moreover, don't stop once you've figured 7

out what went wrong; also try to understand why it went wrong. what might have been tried, or what ought to have been the outcome with correct play. Most chess players are human beings. endowed with human qualities. They smile at the tragedy of other chess players, and say to themselves: 'That would never happen to me.' A highly dangerous presumption! One such example is a game from the 2014 U18 European Championship in the city of Batumi, Georgia, played by the extraordinary Spanish talent Jaime Santos Latasa. In a crucial game that could have earned him the title, Jaime first spoiled a promising middlegame position and then, disappointed about the way the game had developed, played an endgame - that everybody knew was still a draw - on autopilot. The expected result would have earned Jaime the bronze medal (his opponent would be silver medallist, while the Russian player Daniil Yuffa would win gold). But then this happened: 70 ... i.e6?? and after 71.ci>g61 it's zugzwang, and the position is lost. The rest of the game is of little interest: 71. .. i.h3 72.:e7 ci>f&

83.:C2 1-0 Boruchovsky-Santos
Latasa, Batumi 2014 (9). Thus, Boruchovsky became European Champion, Yuffa ended as the runner-up, while Jaime Santos dropped to fourth place. Errors such as the one in this game are usually the result of fatigue, time trouble, or some psychological weakness such as disappointment, apathy, or a sudden distraction. While these human factors can never be ruled out in a practical game, thorough study of the endgame can - and does - help players prevent blundering away a theoretical draw or win in the vast majority of cases. The following well-known diagram represents, I believe, the most important position in the endgame rook vs. pawn. Adrian Mikhalchishin, I am sure, would agree with me, as he presents this position in the first diagram in Chapter 1 of his book Mastering Basic Rook Endgames. Many games have reached this position, and the current one continued as follows:
D
55.h7?
The correct move is 55. <itg7. 55 ... .rlg1+ 56. �h6 �7 57.hStlJ+ �6
58.�h7 Dg3 0-1 Alfaya Marcelo
Martin Duque, San Sebastian 2014. This shows it's never too late to spoil a perfectly tenable game, even in simplified positions. If you are a sceptical nature, and feel inclined to retort 'hang on, this was only a young player, rated below 2000 Elo', well, allow me then to show you another example, from a game Kotronias-Sandalakis, Nikaia 2016:
D
This is essentially the same position. Here, White played 64. �g7 (Kotronias, one would assume, knows exactly what he's doing) 64 ... Introduction :g4+ 65.�8 JZl4+ 66. �g7 Jlf7+, reaching the following position:
67. wg&?? �6 1-0
So there was another trick, victimising an internationally titled chess heavyweight. Or how about the following example taken from an ultimate elite contest:
D
This position occurred in a tiebreak game Gelfand-Anand for the World Championship, Moscow 2012. White could have broken Black' s only resource, Vancura's Defence, even with a tempo to spare, for example
61.Rg3 Rb7 62.Rg4 and White
wins. But here, White instead played
61.J:h7?? and after 61...@d6 Black got
his king closer, drew the game, and retained his world title.

Many more examples of such technical mishaps, or as Dvoretsky called them 'tragicomedies', are presented and analysed in this book to help you improve this crucial phase in the game of chess. Solving diagram positions from a book is not the same as solving problems over the board, but more often than not, having done one's homework will give a player that decisive edge at the moment of making a crucial decision. While doing these exercises, I recommend you try imagining you are playing a real game. This will help you make decisions in the most realistic - and best - frame of mind. Some learners complain: 'Is it really worth studying all endgame positions? What if I never get any of them on my board in a tournament game?' At first, such concerns appear to make some sense, and this reminds me of a strong FIDE Master confessing to me that, as a junior, he once had to deliver checkmate with bishop and knight vs. lone king, and failed. Embarrassed, he went home to study every detail of this endgame, and swore revenge: someday, he would prove that he could do it. At the time of his confession, some 20 years later, the moment still hadn't come, though, and who knows he might never get another shot at redemption. So, was his study time wasted? I would argue that it was not. Determined chess minds usually come back stronger from hardship, by discipline and rigorous analysis. Therefore, even if the statistical likelihood of you getting every position contained in this book in real games were nil, I would still whole-heartedly recommend you analyse all positions carefully; there is no better recipe for significant chess improvement. I am a firm believer in the instructional value of real game examples. It seems to me that the essence of our human condition is that to understand an ordeal, we have to be subjected to it. Theoretical knowledge alone is not enough. Therefore, all the positions in this book were taken from real games, mostly featuring strong players. Throughout this book, however, you will find examples, too, of games between average players - even beginners - particularly where these positions reveal some instructive or common mistakes. I am aware that not every blunder made on the chessboard makes it into the databases, while many others are yet to be 'found', in the Tartakowerian sense of the word; such might well be the object of my future research. The present publication, I believe, is an accurate collection not only of the most important endgames you must know, but also of the most frequent errors players of all levels commit in these positions. How to use the material In this book? Solving the exercise requires two things: an effort to calculate properly and accurate theoretical knowledge of the relevant endgame. In each Introduction exercise, the reader is asked to answer one specific question. The most common question is whether the position is winning or not. Another typical question is to choose between two or more options, an approach I personally like very much, as it mimics the decision-making process during a real game. In such positions, you should particularly look out for any subtle hidden resources. I might also ask you to assess the consequences of some simplifying operation, which is such a common occurrence in a chess game, and one which often requires mature decision-making. (To become proficient in the art of simplification, I highly recommend the books Liquidation on the Chess Board by Joel Benjamin, as well as The Correct Exchange in the Endgame by Eduardas Rozentalis.) A few times I ask you to give all the winning moves in a position, not out of any practical necessity (one winning move is more than enough in a practical game), but with the aim of reinforcing your theoretical knowledge of the endgame in question. When you work out the answers to such questions, calculation takes a back seat, and the error rate in practical play is usually much lower. In each chapter, the exercises are organized in increasing level of difficulty: while the first ones should pose few problems for the average player, the ones at the end of each chapter are likely to challenge even a seasoned chess master. Therefore, each player can work through this book focussing on positions suitable for their level. For less experienced players, my recommended approach is this: solve only the first half of each chapter, and leave the rest for some later stage of your chess improvement. By contrast, I would advise stronger players to start at the end and work their way through the chapter in reversed order, stopping once you feel the problems become as easy as eating your favourite sweet baked food at an outdoor lunch. I recommend that all players, regardless of their Elo, repeat any positions they weren't able to figure out, within one year. I am aware that level of difficulty is to some degree a subjective matter: a player who happens to have studied a particular endgame before might have no problem solving even the more difficult problems on the topic, whereas a player making his first footsteps into new endgame territory might struggle to find the basic ideas. For this reason, I have decided against awarding some sort of 'star system' to indicate the level of difficulty to each problem, which might only mislead you. What I have sometimes provided, though, is statistical analysis to show, for instance, the frequency of and average score in certain positions. To all exercises I have attached a highlighted reference to the corresponding endgame presented in 100 Endgames You Should Know, including exercises relating to the Appendix on fortresses. Please note

that not every single endgame that was covered in 100 Endgames You Must Know has made it into this book, for the simple reason that some positions produce few or no instructive mistakes in chess praxis, and have therefore been left out. Less than a handful of positions in this book are new in the sense that they received no previous coverage in 100 Endgames You Must Know. Where this is the case, I have provided detailed explanations to equip you well with all the knowledge you need to play these positions. Perhaps, such new positions will find their way into a future edition of 100 Endgames You Must Know. A final note on terminology: some terms in the English version of this book have been updated and differ from the terminology used in
100 Endgames You Must Know. I hope the new terminology improves your
reading experience. Enjoy the journey through these exercises - I am confident they will help you become a better chess player. Jesus de la Villa Pamplona, January 2019
CHAPTER 1
Basic endings It only seemed logical to make this the easiest chapter in the entire book. But don't be fooled: you will find some examples of blunders taken from high-level tournament play. It's hard to tell from database info alone whether these mistakes were the result of fatigue, time trouble, or some such psychological factor as mentioned in the introduction. But let me just remind you that superficial knowledge of endgame theory, so common in the chess world, is also an important factor that should not be underestimated.

c D The above diagrams represent four common situations. Examine these four diagrams closely, and keep them in mind while you try the exercises. Knowing what to look out for is the best recipe for playing such positions with confidence, even under time pressure. Diagrams [A] and [B] show two situations in the struggle between rook and bishop: in diagram [A], the king is trapped in the wrong corner and, therefore, Black is already lost; diagram [B] shows us one of the most typical errors, hereby christened as 'right-corner catastrophe'. Diagrams [CJ and [D] aim to alert you to the danger of losing the opposition.: Part I: Typical pawns and pieces (1) 0 Does White have time to capture the g4-pawn?

CHAPTER 2
Knight vs. pawn The endgame covered in this chapter is still relatively easy, as evidenced by a lower error rate in practical play compared to other endings. Even though the average player should be able to play this endgame with confidence, it's necessary to learn about a few subtle resources that might otherwise not easily be discovered over the board. Let's examine the following four diagrams, designed to aid your memory: Diagram [A] represents the circuit of a knight trying to deal with a rook's pawn on the sixth rank. Diagram [B] shows the optimal range of a king vis-a-vis a knight to prevent the latter from sacrificing itself for a passed pawn. Diagram [C] shows the striking case of a knight to move giving checkmate to a king in the corner (usually the result of some cooperative play by the opponent). In diagram [D], the knight alone cannot forever control the pawn and success therefore depends on any effective barriers to delay the arrival of the enemy king.

CHAPTER 3
Queen vs. pawn The endgame of queen vs. pawn entails a more complex finale to a game of chess, as evidenced by a much higher error rate compared to the endgames covered thus far. To become a stronger player, knowledge of the basic rule is essential: the queen wins against a central pawn or a knight's pawn, while against any other pawn the result is a draw. This correct and very useful rule has, however, many exceptions. That's why so many errors slip in, often with unexpected - and painful - results. Furthermore, since players are of ten unfamiliar with the wide array of tricks available in these positions, the outcome of this type of endings almost seems unpredictable. As it is virtually impossible to present every possible trick hidden in these positions, the selected exercises aim to familiarize the reader with some of the most important ones. Particularly, the key positions we shall examine are shown in the diagrams below. In diagrams [A] and [B], White to play can save the game, but he must be alert not to fall prey to a nasty trick. Diagrams [C] and [D] represent two contrasting situations. In diagram [q, Black to move wins, but only by means of the right check; in diagram [D], the pawn on the fifth rank - provided it is to move - can draw against the queen.

CHAPTER 4
Rook vs. pawn A rook vs. pawn scenario often comes about from a rook vs. rook position (see Chapter 9), especially when one player is forced to sacrifice his rook to neutralize a passed pawn, and then tries to race his own pawn up - or down - the board, hoping to have bought himself enough time to secure a draw. I've seen these positions appear on the boards of my students many times during tournament play. The good news is that the methods of play involved in rook vs. pawn positions are clear-cut, and mastery of this kind of endgame promises tangible rewards. Since crucial decisions are usually taken when one pair of rooks still remains on the board, many exercises depart from this situation. Moreover, solving the exercises in this chapter will help you improve two important chess skills: (1) calculation, and (2) learning how and when your chessmen must share duties. The diagrams below provide some insight into the most common patterns and ideas you must know to navigate your way through this endgame with confidence: A cruclal moment
A
Memorize this position: Black to move advances the king and draws; White to move gives a long-range vertical check and wins! Although it doesn't matter which file the pawn is on, a couple of subtle differences must be observed: (1) the drawing procedure is different with a rook's pawn; and (2) a checking distance of two squares from behind (i.e. a check from bS, in our example) only wins against a rook's pawn. There is another important practical feature to this position: the endgame rook vs. rook's pawn appears more than three hundred times Tempo gaining Chapter 4 - Rook vs. pawn in my database, and whenever the side with the pawn was to move, they ended up losing in several dozens of games. In some games, the draw was thrown away on the first move, while in others the losing error occurred at some other critical moment, as we will see in the exercises. Cutting the king off horlzontally
B
In this position, an important (and the only) winning method for White is to play 1J1g5!, cutting off the black king from its pawn so that it won't be able to support it. If the pawn advances, the rook is always in time to capture it. This manoeuvre doesn't work if applied one file further down, as then the rook is unable to successfully deal with the pawn. Oft en this idea has to be anticipated - or even carried out - when both rooks are still on the board! The rook carries out a useful tempo-gaining manoeuvre by first giving check and only then placing itself behind the pawn, forcing the enemy king to lose precious time. This manoeuvre can be decisive if the king is two ranks in front of the pawn, as it is forced to move back.
100 Endgames Workbook
Promoting to a knight Promoting to a knight (in a general sense also known as 'underpromotion', i.e. opting for a piece of lesser value than the queen) with check is another common resource, and is often the only way to save the game when the opponent presses from behind. Diagram [D] is the most typical situation, leading to a draw. In diagram [E], with a rook's pawn, promoting to a knight won't save Black. Positions [F] and [G] are less common, but worthy of attention nonetheless. In diagram [F], which comes about after the rook had to give a check from the fifth rank, knight promotion secures a draw for White. Diagram [G] shows a situation where the weaker side's king has been cut off on the edge of the board while the stronger side's king was able to rapidly approach, unhindered by any obstacles along the way. In this case, promoting to a knight is losing.

CHAPTER 5
Rook vs. two pawns Similar to the previous chapter, this imbalance commonly arises after one player sacrifices their rook for a passed pawn. Therefore, the fight between a rook and two pawns is of great practical importance. Almost no specific theoretical knowledge is required, except perhaps for the well-known rule that two connected pawns on the sixth rank are unstoppable, which is a common situation even with more material on the board. On the other hand, when a rook combats two separated pawns (one supported by its king) the practical advice provided in this chapter is all you need to play these positions with confidence. Specifically, keep in mind the following three techniques: outflanking to get the king in front of the pawns, latching onto the hindmost pawn with the king (hereby christened as playing tag, as in the children's game), and switching pole po sition, i.e. being able to choose which pawn should be the front-runner in the race toward promotion. If you're not yet familiar with these techniques, I recommend that you first study the theoretical chapter in 100 Endgames You Must Know, before trying the exercises. As was my approach in 100 Endgames You Must Know, I focus here mainly on positions with connected pawns; positions with separated pawns, though interesting, are of too little theoretical value, and therefore omitted.

Same-coloured bishops: bishop + pawn vs. bishop The previous chapters all dealt with endgames characterized by extreme imbalances (queen vs. pawn; rook vs. one or two pawns). Now the time has come to focus on some endgames involving pieces of equal strength. This chapter examines same-coloured bishop endings (for opposite coloured bishop endings, see Chapter 8). In these positions, most errors are the result of misplaying standard theoretical positions, particularly one that requires the defending king to seek the opposition from behind. Diagram [A] shows the correct position of the defending king: it is a draw regardless of who is to play. Diagram [B] is similar, but here, Black to move still has to make the correct decision, something many players in practice fail to do! In diagram [C], Black loses regardless of who is to play, because the diagonal from which to stop the pawn is too short. Diagram (D] presents another defensive technique with the king in front: Black draws if he immediately brings the king to g8.

CHAPTER 7
Bishop vs. knight: one pawn on the board From a theoretical point of view, the endgame of bishop vs. knight (with one side being a pawn up) is among the least well-researched. That said, it's worth taking notice of a couple of useful - indeed paradoxical - positions. Diagrams [A] and [B] show us the most common critical positions, of which the position in diagram [A] is most seen in practice. In both diagrams, we see a dangerous h-pawn on the verge of promotion, which would be winning if it weren't for an important resource the defending side has at his disposal: sacrificing the passive bishop to imprison the gluttonous king. Furthermore, the position in diagram [A] is a draw no matter who is to move, whereas the position in diagram [B] is winning for Black, regardless of whose turn it is. It's fairly easy to see that the side with the pawn should be in no rush to go after the bishop. In diagrams [C] and [D] we see knight and pawn with an off-side defending king; the position in diagram [C] is a win for Black, provided he is to play, as the bishop can be deprived of the squares on the shortest diagonal; in diagram [D] the shortest diagonal for the bishop is five squares, and therefore it doesn't need the help of its king to make a draw, unless White plays carelessly. Except from these diagram positions, it's useful to know that the knight usually has a hard time stopping a passed pawn supported by a bishop, and unless the knight is firmly settled in front of the pawn - and barring the odd tactic - its only hope lies in stalemate.

CHAPTER 8
Opposite-coloured bishops: bishop + two pawns vs. bishop The opposite-coloured bishops endgame is governed by rules of its own, and typically represents a fight between one side trying to push their passed pawn(s) forward and a defending bishop preventing this, operating through a parallel universe its oblique competitor can never touch. Thus, we enter a whole new world of endgame theory. Here are some key guidelines to keep in mind: • Two connected pawns are a draw, provided the defending bishop is able to take up the correct defensive stand; • Two pawns separated by one file almost never win; Two pawns further away from one another almost always win (a caveat: if one of those pawns is a knight's pawn, it'd better not be too far advanced!). Also, beware of specific features/manoeuvres, such as: • Special pawns; and • Bring the king round via a lengthy detour. The diagrams below show six common positions players tend to mess up. Except for the position in diagram [F], the result of the game doesn't depend on whose turn it is. Basic defensive stand Basic defensive stand

But for those players that are new to this endgame, I suggest the following training method: try to determine what the correct result of the game should be (with Black and with White to move); then, try to determine the appropriate winning or drawing manoeuvre. If your assessment proves wrong, look up the corresponding position in 100 Endgames You Must Know; only after that you should do the test positions in this chapter. Also, please be prepared to have some good fun, as some of these positions come with a fantastic element of surprise! (120)

CHAPTER 9
Rook + pawn vs. rook While the rook is but a passive bystander in the earliest stages of a game, the further a game of chess evolves, the more important it becomes. Once an endgame is reached, statistics unmistakably show that it decides more games than any other. The improving chess player is therefore strongly encouraged to improve their skills wielding the most straightforward of chessmen. Statistics, however, also show that rook endgames produce a much higher error rate than any other, so despite its rectilinear simplicity, there must be more than meets the eye. The selected exercises aim to provide you with a better grasp of the most important ideas. Some motifs repeat themselves throughout the test positions, but are usually approached from different perspectives. I am convinced that by facing similar problems repeatedly, and approached from different angles and with additional subtleties, learning becomes both more efficient and more meaningful. Beware that if you are unfamiliar with some of the basic manoeuvres, even the easiest exercises might prove challenging. If this is true for you, I recommend you study the main theory in 100 Endgames You Must Know before trying the exercises. I've grouped what I believe to be the most important positions into three categories, as shown in the diagrams below. In none of the positions does it matter who is to play, except for the position in diagram [H]. Basic positions Philidor position Lucena - The Bridge

CHAPTER 10
Rook + two pawns vs. rook Welcome to yet another chapter on the ever-important rook endgame. Contrary to the previous chapter, which dealt with rook and one pawn vs. rook, here there are not so many theoretical positions. The five main theoretical positions represented below in six diagrams each have distinctive features. Some of them allow for a very simple defence; others require thorough study of a tedious and exhausting defence, all too easily mishandled in a practical game (in particular positions with a bishop's or a rook's pawn).

CHAPTER 11
Pawn endings As players' ratings go up, pawn endgames become less common. The following statistics illustrate this: in the general database (with more than 10 million games), pawn endgames occur in about 3%, whereas in Chess Informant this rate drops to a mere 0.8%. From personal experience I can attest to this, as my personal database clearly mirrors this general trend: before I reached 2300 Elo, 3% of my own games ended in pawn endings; once I surpassed that level, the rate dropped to only 1%. The phenomenon, I believe, is fairly easily explained: the beginning chess player is naturally inclined to capture or exchange any chessmen on offer, and often does so unwittingly, i.e. by failing to properly assess the resulting positions. The expert player, on the other hand, is able to calculate more deeply, and understands the potentially fatal consequences of entering into this pieceless territory far better than the beginner does. Therefore, in practical games between strong players, we often see one of two scenarios unfold: (1) players may decline offers to simplify the position, knowing it is not in their best interest to venture into a pawn endgame, or (2) the game ends beforehand, i.e. the players, by mutual understanding, recognize that to play on a position that they know will end in a split point, would be a pointless affair altogether. The above stated is reflected in the selected exercises, which feature games of different levels. Despite the large number of exercises, the level of difficulty is generally lower compared to other chapters. If you are a proficient player I suggest you try some of the final exercises; if you feel those are like shooting fish in a barrel. you might want to skip this chapter altogether, and focus on more challenging aspects of endgame theory instead. Contrary to all other chapters in this book, no diagrams are presented to illustrate any basic positions. The reason is that there are simply too many of them. Moreover, virtually all come with a myriad of exceptions. But please note that some of the solutions refer to the most important diagrams on pawn endings from Chapter 1.

CHAPTER 12
Other material relations Just as in every chess book there comes a time to deal with odds and ends, in every chess player's life there comes a time to play a pawnless endgame. We shall deal here with the dreaded bishop-and-knight vs. lone king endgame, as well as with the endgame of rook-and-bishop vs. rook. A few other miscellaneous topics included are those dealing with fortresses, drawing with bishop against rook, and rook-and-pawn vs. queen. In a pawnless endgame, recognizing certain key positions is paramount, i.e. knowing how and when it is possible to get them, or, as the game situation may require, knowing how and when to avoid them. This holds true, in particular, for the bishop-and-knight vs. lone king mating procedure. In practice, the lone king has often escaped justice, but trust me, once you know what to look out for, you'll be able to bring it to execution.

CHAPTER 13
Appendix Fortresses A fortress is a position in which one side has a clear material advantage, but is unable to force a win against a simple yet rock-solid defensive set-up that usually requires little or no subtle play by the defender. Amateur players seem to be naturally attracted to such positions. One reason for this might be that in the amateur's mind, the sturdy fortress evokes the image of heroism of a bygone age. And why not, chess fortresses often do in fact resemble the mighty ones from medieval times. The most striking features of a fortress are: • No pawn breaks are available; • There are no passed pawns, or these are firmly blocked; • The stronger side can't penetrate into the enemy position; • The defending side is in no danger of falling into zugzwang. On the other hand, the attacker must try to break the fortress by any means possible (often, none will be available). The most important techniques to be tried are: • Break in forcefully, by means of sacrifices; • Get the king in; • Use zugzwang. No diagrams are shown here; there are simply too many theoretical fortresses. Should your memory need refreshing on this topic, I recommend you look at the positions given in the Introduction and Fortress Appendix of 100 Endgames You Must Know. My personal belief is that the exercises here are generally easier compared to other chapters because you know exactly what to look for. Even the most impressive moves such as the ones seen in Fedoseev-Carlsen could be found by ordinary players if they have at least some notion of what they should be looking for. Of course, in a real game situation nobody will tell you whether there is a fortress to be found, so developing a keen eye for any sign that might warn you of such a possibility arising in the position is extremely useful. By analogy, developing a sense of danger to prevent a weaker side from creating a fortress is also an essential skill for the improving chess player. (285)

The outcome of the endgame rook vs. bishop should be a draw when the defending king has taken refuge in the corner of the colour contrary to that of the bishop. There is, however, one particular error, seen many times even at master level, that you must know. 94• • • .i.15? This right corner catastrophe has occurred in dozens of games by players of all levels: of all the 'obvious' squares, this is the only one that loses. Avoid this disaster by remembering that the bishop should be far away from the king, so that it can give some timely checks. 94 ... �c4! is one of several correct moves: 95.<li>e7 �h8 and the black king returns to its comfort zone, in the corner. According to my database, out of eighteen games that saw this mistake, sixteen times it proved fatal. In one game, the player with the rook simply failed to take advantage and on one other occasion, the fifty-move rule stood in the way.

Exercise 85 Giorgi Glorgadze Andrei lstratescu Elista ol 1998 (4)
D
Despite the offside black king, White can't win, unless the black rook is unable to give any checks from behind. The main rule that applies to this kind of endgame is as follows: it's a draw if the rook is on the first or the second rank; if it's on any other rank, the side with the rook loses. The exact placement of the black king is, perhaps surprisingly, never an issue: it ensures a draw from any square on the board. Notwithstanding these theoretical generalities, according to my
100 Endgames Workbook
database, this concrete position, including all possible symmetries and positions with the rook on different squares, has occurred in only a few games.

In conclusion, we can establish the following rule: the defending king, to make a draw, mustn't be more than one step away from the enemy pawn, i.e. in this particular position it should have been on the d3-square, for example.

58.f4?1

Exercise 139 Nguyen Van Huy Le Quang Liem Ho Chi Minh City Ach 2012 (4)
D
One extra pawn almost never wins in an opposite-coloured bishops endgame. Theoretical interest, therefore, usually departs from a two-pawn surplus. With more pawns on the board, the key to winning such positions is to find the right way to simplify, i.e. by exchanging any and all of the opponent's pawns, to end up with the most promising two vs. zero majority.
33.h4?
Not the best move, natural as it may look; it allows Black to fix the pawns and choose which breaks best suit him.
33.g4! leads to a draw, by achieving
different pawns to be exchanged, e.g. 33 ...@f7: Chapter 14 - Solutions to exercises A) 34.gxfS gxfS! (if 34 ...exfS 35.h3 - White can simply wait) 3S.@f3 'it>f6 36.�b3 eS 37.�c2 @gs 38.h4+ (Black wins in similar fashion if the h-pawn stays behind) 38. .. 'itif6

endgame theory. The pawn being a bishop's pawn means that Black has two defensive options; with a central pawn, he would only have one.

Faced with the imminent loss of half his pawn majority, White must seize the moment to transform the position into a theoretically winning endgame.

Exchanging queens is the easiest way to win: the a2-pawn always ensures victory in this two vs. one pawn endgame.

White should now win by breaking through on the kingside. In the game, however, he misplayed the position and was lucky to come out on top eventually.

White seems to forget about his reserve tempo on the queenside. It was necessary to use it to kick the king a little further away from the candidate queen: 39.a3! aS 4 0.a4 @cS 41.fS! and now, indeed, a white pawn will become a queen.

Black falls into one of the most painful zugzwang positions known to man, even though it is more common to see this happen with a white pawn on fS rather than h5.

This move, while not an error (it leads to mate in the same number of moves as via the prescribed method) is a step in the wrong direction. The black king is locked in a cage it can't escape from. The rest of the winning procedure is child's play.

White has achieved a winning Philidor position, but time is against him, both on the clock (he was in serious time trouble) and on the board (he is close to violating the fifty-move rule). 105 . .Bf2?1 This game represents one of the most dramatic climaxes in the history of modern chess. A pawnless endgame started on move 66, and after a long phase of objective equilibrium, Black fell into a losing Philidor position on move 102. At this point, White had to find a checkmate within eleven moves or sign the score sheets with only half a point because of the fifty-move rule. Unfortunately for him, the move in the game leads to a longer checkmating sequence.

Exercise 284 Wang Yue Vlswanathan Anand Nice blindfold 2009 (11) Black must see to it that the pawn stays behind Troitzky's line, i.e. it mustn't be allowed to reach the c5-square (the pawn reaching c4 can't be prevented). Thus, there is more than one winning move. 61 ... �cS? In the endgame of two knights vs. pawn, the further back the pawn is blocked, the better the winning chances are. For different kinds of pawns, there is a different limit, known as 'Troitsky's line'. Even without remembering this line by heart, it is clear that it's always best not to let the pawns advance too far. It's difficult to know exactly what Anand was thinking in this blindfold game, but he had two ways to prevent the pawn from getting to the c5-square:
A) 61 ...
tl:Be4 is the most obvious move, since the knight will go to cS;
B) 61. ..

White's joy is short-lived, as he immediately self-destructs his fortress. The position with the black pawn on h6 allows an easy defence for White: he simply has to prevent the move ...h6-h5 with his bishop. With the black pawn on h7 the possible 'fortress' created doubts for a long time: since Black can carry through ...h7-h5 with the help of either his rook or his king, and in general this should be winning. However, here White can keep the draw. The key is twofold: he has to prevent the ... h7-h5 advance until the black rook leaves the second rank, and then has to meet the advance to hS with the immediate response h3-h4!. And this should happen under two conditions: the bishop stays on the long diagonal in case of the advance ... g5-g4, and the pawn on h4 is not lost in case of a pawn exchange. or example:

endgame. White has optimal control over the bishop on the long diagonal: the g7-/h8-squares are taboo, while the f6-/e5-/d4-/c3-/b2-squares are all controlled by White's pieces. This leaves Black only with the suspicious-looking al-square. On the other hand, since White can't do anything to control that square too, Black is actually OK. 101 ... .i.g7?

Black's king faces a. laborious task: not only must it first create the fortress - by forcing the b5-pa.wn up to the b6-squa.re - it also needs to go back all the way and hide inside it.
