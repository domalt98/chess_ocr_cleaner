I had not improved my Elo for about six months, which felt like a long time. We started by looking at my games and making lists of my mistakes, so we could see which kind of mistakes were recurring. I was good at spotting my own tactical opportunities, but I missed a lot of my opponents' moves. Another recurring mistake was that I did not play the critical moves when I departed from preparation. I was playing too fast at that point. Furthermore I had a tendency to play a bit too much according to the opponents' level. I began thinking about these things during my games, even though it is not easy to change your habits and the way you play. I also started annotating my own games, with both variations and words. At the same time, I started solving exercises online every day. There you use a chess clock, which can sharpen the concentration. When you are running out of time in a game, it can be vital to be able to calculate essential variations quickly. It went well in the following year, especially at the Norwegian Open Championship in Fagernes in April 20 13. Axel was my second and helped me with files for opening preparation, with both moves and explanations. I had also started making such files myself, understanding that this work makes it much easier to handle the opening and its aftermath. You simply understand everything better if you have worked seriously on the lines in advance. Before the event I felt well prepared and in good form. I got off to a strong start and fought hard to hold on till the end. I had improved my ability to concentrate and I managed to score six points in the nine rounds, collecting my first Grandmaster norm. From April to May I won almost 100 rating points. Quickly thereafter I made two IM norms and passed the 2400 mark in July 201 3, earning the title. By that point I had won 200 points in a year. Some people made comparisons between Magnus Carlsen and me. This is rather silly; among other points, I am 14 years old and Magnus was already a grandmaster at 1 3. Axel has taught me a lot about chess, but most of all I appreciate that he showed me a good way to organize my training. I feel that I know what I need to do now, even though I still feel the need for someone to lead the way. I have changed a lot in the last year, become more eager, worked a lot on chess and started to concentrate a lot better. It is not easy to say what the defining factor is; nor is it important. I am happy to enjoy chess and to play tournaments. I love the social aspects of chess: travelling, making new friends and then, of course, winning.

To friends and family, I have said I enjoy travelling the world. Playing chess isn't a socially-acceptable reason for giving up a normal life, but visiting fifty countries is. AI; a matter of fact, I have spent those years with chess only because it's so fascinating. The game itself has always been my main driving force. However, during the last couple of years I have also had another aim - to write this book. I wished to become a Grandmaster before I started; the working title was Grandmaster Training Manual. In the beginning of May 20 1 2, I suddenly realized that the book was more important than my results. It was time to start writing, immediately and at once. I want to teach how to 'think chess' and how to practise chess. It is not a small aim, and there are inevitably other views whatever I write. Nevertheless, I strongly believe in what I say. I feel that the book holds a part of me that I will lose when it's published, but that is a sacrifice I am happy to make. There is a reason I have a strong opinion of how to practise chess: I started training seriously only as an adult and hence know which methods worked for me and which didn't. The first year after I started to practise methodically, in 2006 when I was 20 years old, I improved from Elo 2093 to
2205. The second year brought me up to 2458 .
During the past five years, I have made chess my priority over other hobbies (often), friends (more often) and school (always). However, I have often found myself coaching rather than playing. In 2011 - 1 2, I lived and worked as a coach in Kristiansund, Norway, and had the chance to teach the methods I propose. In that way, I could see which parts the students understood and which parts had to be explained in other ways. Thus, those students have helped me with the book, as has every student I have coached over the years. At the time of writing, I have moved back to Lund in Sweden, but I am still coaching the Swedish and Norwegian National Junior Teams from time to time. I spend more energy coaching than playing, and even though I have not made any GM norms (yet), I am happy about the three norms that Nils Grandelius and Aryan Tari achieved when I was their second. There are also a lot of other people to thank. Jesper Hall was my first coach when I started to play chess, and his pedagogical approach has been an important source of inspiration. In the final phase of writing, he read the whole draft and gave me a lot of advice. Hakan Lyngsjo has helped me extensively with the language; my last name is English but it was 400 years ago one of my ancestors left Scotland to try his luck as a gardener in Sweden. There are also many friends who have read what I have written and given fruitful feedback: Stellan Brynell, Nils Grandelius, Andreas Skytte Hagen, )ens Karlsson, Brede Kvisvik, Silas Lund, Sebastian Nilsson, Henrik Olsson, Daniel Semcesen, Aryan Tari, Hans Tikkanen, Michael de Verdier and Patrik Ohagen. I have to thank Quality Chess for believing in the idea, and last but not least my wife, for accepting everything I do, like writing all night.

Mter collecting examples over several years, and writing for the last year, I have finally reached the goal of my five years with chess. I understand that most readers will not be able to find the same amount of time, but I hope that this book will encourage more people to study chess. Nothing is more fascinating.

Appendix- Databases 367 Appendix- Endgames Name Index Introduction This book is mainly for the ambitious player, but don't let the word ambition frighten you! It only means that you really want to improve. My ambition is to teach you what you need to get started; the book is both about "thinking chess" and about practising chess. And I do mean "thinking chess" not "thinking about chess" - in the same way that "speaking English'' and "speaking about English" are different things. Fulfilling these two aims obviously can't be done without showing a lot of instructive games. Since our game is universal, players of different strength can learn from the same examples. I have strived to explain in a way that makes the annotations understandable, but still not too simple. In 2006, when I switched from being a human to being a chess player, I worked through 26 chess books from cover to cover. But somehow I arrived at the conclusion that improving at chess requires more active learning than what is possible by simply reading. My approach became to look for moves rather than generalizing them into verbal rules, and it worked well. It would not be the best selling point to claim that reading books is unnecessary, but luckily, I don't claim that. Firstly, this book contains a fair share of exercises, forcing your brain to work with the material. Secondly, I think there are some rules of thumb and thinking techniques that you need to learn before working by yourself I refer to sayings like "Put your rook on the same file as the opponent's queen", and methods like candidate moves, blunder checks and critical positions. The first question is whether rules of thumb and thinking techniques are useful at all. I found an extensive debate about this while I was finishing this book and got myself up to date on the latest chess literature of the last few years. Willy Hendriks takes the most extreme position in Move First, Think Later (20 12). He argues that there's nothing but concrete moves; Alexander Kotov's mechanical variation trees, from Think Like a Grandmaster (1971), and other thinking techniques are oversimplifying and of no use at the board. Since the debate covers a fundamental view of our game, I think I have to make my position clear. Hendriks' book is a good starting point, since it's fantastically well written. Rules of Thumb Hendriks uses "The best reaction to an attack on the wing is a counterattack in the centre" as an example of a rule of thumb. He writes that the rule is useful for coaches when in hindsight explaining why their students erred, but that it's useless as a prescription when playing. A small statistical research is done to prove his opinion: only in 2 of 34 games was the best reaction to
17. g4 a pawn move in the centre.
Nor is Hendriks delighted with Mark Dvoretsky's modification, that an unprepared wing attack should be met by a timely counterblow in the centre. Such conditions transform the rule to a truism, in the end not saying more than "If the move is the best, play it!"

I agree with much of his writing, but I think he takes it too far. The rule to "open the centre when the opponent attacks on the wing" is a part of the inner logic of chess. What he doesn't mention in his statistical research is that the players with White also know this rule! White played
17.g4 only when seeing that it doesn't allow action in the centre.
However, even though there are some useful rules, modern chess has a pragmatic attitude towards them. They may even be harmful. A psychological experiment (Hooler et al, 1 996) explains my view in an illustrative manner. Two groups of subjects, consisting both of beginners and experts, tasted various brands of wine. One of the groups in addition wrote down a verbal description of what they tasted. A week later the two groups were tested on their ability to recognize the wines. The group that wrote down the verbal descriptions scored much worse! The conclusion to this surprising result was that the wines were too complex to describe verbally. Many details were not possible to verbalize, and the subjects forgot them when they wrote down the others. The phenomenon is called verbal overshadowing. The analogy with chess is simple to make - chess is also too complex; every unique position requires an individual approach. It's not possible to play according to an instruction manual. However, in Sweden, the holy land of IKEA, instruction manuals have a special place. They not only help us to assemble our furniture, but also to live our lives. But living with chess is living a different life. Chess is complex and there is no single book that can teach the secret behind finding the best moves. The only proverb Hendriks approves is "No proverb can beat a good move." It's witty, but more than anything else a truism. The proverbs are there only to help us find good moves! Many of them are useful if they are used with caution. Verbal overshadowing is not only a problem for subjects in psychological experiments. I completely agree with Jonathan Rowson in Chess for Zebras (2005) that the main problem for many ambitious players is that they focus on knowledge. A good chess player is not someone with well-defined knowledge, but rather one with great skills. Thinking techniques Willy Hendriks argues that thinking techniques such as 'critical positions' are of little value. Humans are not like that; we look for moves before we define the characteristics of a position. He is right when he says that we see several moves before anything else. However, we need the thinking techniques when deciding which of them to play. His title, Move First, Think Later, would be less entertaining but more to the point if it read Moves First, Thoughts Later. During a game, it's too time-consuming to always look for candidate moves and make blunder checks. Instead, I think those techniques should be used extensively in training during a limited period. I will explain what I mean with a short theoretical discussion. Introduction 9 Abilities are things we know that we can do, like playing the first moves of opening theory in our favourite opening. There are also things we know that we can't do - inabilities. I guess one example is winning with two knights against a pawn. Other things we don't even know that we can't do - it's completely beyond our horizon. For understandable reasons, giving an example is impossible. If we put those three things in a matrix (see below), there is an empty fourth parameter. We Can We Can't Conscious Subconscious The empty box is for the skills we aren't conscious of, but still possess. And they are what we mainly use in chess. Making a blunder check is such a skill for some players. They do it, but not deliberately. Looking for pawn levers may be a less known example. To learn a skill, it has to pass through all the stages above; the technique has to be discovered, studied and repeated, consciously and extensively. And finally it becomes a part of our intuition. Learning process We Can We Can't Conscious Subconscious It may not give the best short-term results to make a blunder check before every move; it takes time and disturbs the normal thought process. However, hopefully the blunder check will gradually be internalized. After some time, the subconscious intuition automatically makes a blunder check when needed, without a big effort. Over the years I have internalized different thinking techniques into my intuition. I have from time to time lost games unnecessarily because I used too much energy on one aspect of the game. But there is no doubt that those losses have been worth their weight in Elo. 1 0 Pump Up Your Rating I have tried to be consistent in my approach to rules and thinking techniques throughout the whole book, but I hope you can forgive me if sometimes I failed. Chess isn't easy, neither for players, nor for coaches. First part: How to th ink chess The first four chapters lay the foundation for positional chess. The first chapter is about pawn levers, with the thesis that they are the essential part of planning. The next chapter moves on to the pieces, mainly discussing exchanges but also positions with material imbalances. I think they are a good foundation for understanding which factors make a piece good or bad. In the third chapter, the pawn levers and piece exchanges are linked together to form a list of auxiliary questions, where critical positions and general game theory are two of the added topics. However, to be able to play positional chess, it's also necessary to calculate. Calculation is the subject of the fourth chapter. Second part: How to study chess The next four chapters show an approach to serious chess training. It can be summarized in five words: active learning through structured training. I'll go deeper into the subject in the introduction to Part Two. The four pillars of chess training described in this book, in decreasing order of importance, are: J..The List of Mistakes - analysing your games and categorizing the mistakes J..The Woodpecker Method - learning the tactical motifs and solving simple exercises to internalize them into your intuition J..Openings - studying them in such a way that you also learn middlegame positions and standard moves J..Theoretical Endgames - studying them only once Learning from our mistakes One important characteristic for a chess player is self-knowledge; to understand that you don't lose by chance but because you still have things to learn. To show what I mean, I dive directly into action - a game. Mikhailo Oleksienko -Axel Smith Vasylyshyn Memorial, Lviv 28th November 20 1 0 l.d4 �f6 2.c4 g6 My plan was to play the Griinfeld after 3.lDc3 d5. Black exchanges one of his centre pawns but plans to put pressure on White's centre. With such a strategy, time is crucial. Therefore, it's important that Black can take on c3 after 4.cxd5 lDxd5 5.e4. It's seldom correct to retreat pieces in the Griinfeld. Introduction 1 1 To avoid retreating, Black generally avoids playing ...d5 until White has placed his knight on c3. However, White has another way to prepare e2-e4.

This looks ugly, but the idea is clear; if 3 ...d5 4.cxd5 ltlxd5 5.e4, Black has to retreat the knight. 3 ...e5!?

I didn't expect 3.f3 and hadn't examined the lines for many years. During the eleven minutes I spent before deciding to go for this pawn sacrifice, I lost more and more self-confidence. 3 ...e5 tries to pinpoint the weakness White created with f2-f3.

When the move came, I did my best to act unaffected, as if it was part of the plan. After a few minutes I came to my senses and resigned. The following evening was not the nicest I have had. 1-0 The game above is short and annotated from the first until the last move. For the rest of the book, I have focused on the relevant part of the games. Personally, I don't find the game moves interesting if they precede the critical position or come after the relevant explanation, but I have included a few of them for the curious reader. However, those moves are left unannotated. In that way, there is more space left for the relevant game fragments. This game is my insurance against taking myself and everything regarding chess too seriously. How could I, when I lose in ten moves? Introduction 1 3 The reason I use a lot of examples from my own games, or my students and friends, is simply that I know those games best and, of course, since I think they are good examples. Actually, many of the moves I'll show are painful mistakes, like in the game above. For some themes, I have not found any good examples and instead created them mysel£ In those cases, I have tried to keep everything as game-like as possible. The biggest disadvantage with playing a lot of chess is that, inevitably, a lot of great games are forgotten. The game against Oleksienko is neither great, nor easy to forget! However, I think that the mistakes I made in the game will help me to explain three general principles that follow throughout the whole book: Every detail counts It's easy to say that I lost because I blundered a piece, but I think it's possible to learn more from the game. Questions that spring to my mind are: Why did I become nervous when I was surprised in the opening? Why did I let my emotions affect the way I reasoned? In some sense, chess is only about making good moves. At the same time, there are a lot of important internal and external factors. To work with those is important for every ambitious chess player. The first principle that runs throughout the whole book is therefore that every detail counts. Internalizing thinking techniques I have already mentioned this subject above. However, you may have noticed that my intuition was not good enough in the game against Oleksienko. Today, I automatically become extra careful if I feel that I am being influenced by a lot of feelings, and I put more effort into blunder checking. The second principle is to use thinking techniques extensively during a limited period, to internalize it in your intuition. Active learning I believe in learning by doing, which is the third principle that applies throughout the book. To get the most out of the time you devote to chess, you must give maximum effort. For that reason, there are exercises in every chapter. When I learned the variation with 3 ...e5 that I played against Oleksienko, I had only read about it in a book. I studied passively without questioning anything or analysing on my own. It's hardly surprising that I had problems remembering the moves a few years later. I have often tried to discuss the theoretical or philosophical part of chess with strong players, but many of them are simply not interested. I interpret this as another sign that skill should be preferred over knowledge. Strong players are interested in moves and specific evaluations, not general principles. This attitude has given them their strength. I want to present some of those players. They had a strong impact on this book, by being friends and training partners for many years. I have learned a lot from them. 1 4 Pump Up Your Rating Model players When I became serious about chess in 2006, I was lucky to live in Lund, a town with 100,000 inhabitants and many aspiring players. We have trained together, travelled together, won together and lost together. Over a period of four years, six players in Lunds ASK became International Masters and another two became Grandmasters. Nils Grandelius is one of them. Since he will appear with a lot of instructive mistakes in this book, I hasten to say that he is the chess player I admire the most. He has positional understanding like an experienced grandmaster, a divine tactical creativity and an elaborate opening repertoire. He plays the endgame well, can win with the least possible advantage and has a strong mind - keeping motivation through losses and wins. I struggle to understand why he is still below 2600, but I guess that the answer can be found somewhere in the fact that he follows periods of hard work with periods of enjoying life. This is, by the way, also something I admire. Hans Tikkanen is another player with whom I have spent countless hours. For many years, we analysed most of my games together. After an extensive tactical training program, Tikkanen improved 1 00 Elo points during the summer of 20 1 0 and made his three GM norms in seven weeks. Many of the chapters in the book will have a model player. Tikkanen will be presented in Chapter 6, where his secret method is revealed, and Grandelius in Chapter 7, about openings. I have also learned a lot from other players. We have had several training camps in Lund with Peter Heine Nielsen and Ulf Andersson. It's an exceptional experience to see Ulf Andersson analyse. He moves the pieces around, talks about pawn structures, coordination, outposts and disturbances. When he sees a specific pawn structure, he immediately knows where the pieces are better and worse placed. Without hesitation, he refers to games from 40 years back. When everyone else is exhausted, Andersson continues to analyse. His enthusiasm for the game is palpable, as is his knowledge. This is something he has worked out on his own - Ulf Andersson has a unique understanding that is highly esteemed around the world. Three of his games, which he has partly annotated himself, are included in the book. Attitude There is a saying that we all play chess for different reasons, but it's also possible to turn the argument the other way around. All of us like the game and are curious about learning more, all of us appreciate when the pieces suddenly coordinate in an unexpected way and all of us enjoy the feeling when we understand something new. And none of us likes to lose. It's the same with me. I love the game, but even more to win. {Winning is nice partly because it's a way to avoid losing!) The last chapter is titled Attitude. It's a mix of themes, but they have in common that they may stop us from getting the most out of our potential. If l had kept a cool head against Oleksienko, I don't think I would have blundered the piece. Among the themes are: practical tournament tips for the serious player, how to win drawn positions, an appeal against draws, keeping focus and time management. Chess players always have a tendency to end up in time trouble, which reminds me that it's really time to start the book.
PART I
POSITIONAL CHESS
Chapter 1 Club: Team Viking Born: 1 966
GM: 1 997
No Pawn Lever No Plan Agrest was raised in Vitsebsk, Belarus, but moved to Sweden in 1994. He has won the Swedish Championship Jour times and is known for his solid but powerfol play. His club, Team Viking, competes with Lund for the gold medal in the Swedish Team Championship every year, and has been successful most of the time. 1 8 Pump Up Your Rating "lhepawns are the soul ofchess" The quote is 260 years old but still very valid. Actually, what Philidor wrote in his bookAna(yse du jeu des Echecs, was: "( .. .) de bien jouer les pions; ils sont l'ame des Echecs". Literally, it's translated as "Play well with the pawns; they are the soul of chess." As play is an active verb, I interpret the sentence as a request, not only to handle the pawns well but also to move them. It hits the point even better - pawns should be used actively. That's also why I have decided to use the term pawn lever, instead of the more common pawn break. The word lever comes from Philidor's native French and is "a rigid bar resting on a pivot, used to move a heavy or firmly fixed load" according to the Oxford Dictionary. It is a simple machine that can achieve wonders. Or in Archimedes' words: "Give me a place to stand, and I shall move the Earth." It is the same in chess. A pawn lever is a pawn move that allows the opponent to capture the pawn with one of his own pawns. It does not only move the pawn closer to promotion, but also achieves one or more other important purposes. The aim of this chapter is to discuss why pawn levers are so fundamental when creating a plan. I'll start by discussing different purposes of pawn levers, and conclude the first section with four exercises. The second section is arranged in the opposite way: it starts with five introductory exercises and continues with the question of how to form a plan when there are no achievable pawn levers. The difficulty of doing so is the underlying message of the whole chapter. The Swedish Grandmaster Evgenij Agrest is the model player in this section. Positions without pawn levers lead us to the next topic: prophylactic moves - how to stop the opponent from carrying out pawn levers. After having talked so positively about pawn levers, the last section tries to balance the picture by discussing the disadvantages of them. The conclusion is nevertheless still the same. Purposes of pawn levers There are many reasons to advance pawns; they gain space, control squares or simply move closer to promotion. However, pawn levers put the pawn in contact with one of the opponent's pawns, thus offering him the chance to capture. Such pawn levers have other strategical reasons: A To take control over the centre A To increase the scope of the pieces A To open lines on the wing where you are strongest A To improve the pawn structure Pawn levers are often difficult to achieve, but not always. One early example is from Philidor's opening, arising after l.e4 e5 2.tllf3 d6: Chapter 1- No Pawn Lever - No Plan 1 9 c e f g h With 3.d4! White creates a pawn lever. I am sure Philidor liked such moves, even when played against his own opening. 3.d4 gains control over the centre and opens up for the bishop. Often a pawn lever is instead played to release a cramped position, opening a diagonal for the bishop or a file for the rook. It may also be played to open up on the wing where you have the advantage. One good example is the Mar del Plata variation of the King's Indian (l .d4 tlJf6 2.c4 g6 3.tlJc3 .Bg7 4.e4 d6 5 . .Be2 O-O 6.tlJf3 e5 7.O-O tDc6 8.d5 tlJe7) where White plays for the pawn lever c4-c5 and Black, sometimes, plays for ... f5-f4 followed by the pawn lever ...g6-g5-g4. An attack on the king is often connected with such a plan. Lastly, pawn levers can be played simply to improve the pawn structure, either getting rid of a weak pawn or creating a weak pawn in the opponent's camp. Of course, many pawn levers achieve several of the mentioned goals, as in the following game.

I played the same variation with Black against Jon Ludvig Hammer in January 20 12. While I followed the game berween Grischuk and Giri, Hammer reinvented most of the moves himself He deviated with 1 5.�el. Which pawn levers does Black have? It seems unrealistic to advance the hanging pawns without making them too weak, so Black will clearly try to play .. .f6. It opens up for the queen, the rook and the bishop, and challenges White in the centre. If White can't hold on to the centre, Black will get a very active position. Black should not forget about tactics, though, since an immediate ... f6 would be met by lLlxd5, exploiting the undefended rook on a8. In addition, Black can also try to undermine the centre with the pawn lever ...g5. It sounds very promising for Black, but White also has a pawn lever to play for. Since it's his turn to move, he grabs the initiative.

Both sides have their assets; White has a strong pawn on c6 and has managed to demolish Black's pawn structure in front of the king, while Black has a strong bishop. The position is dynamically balanced and the game ended in a draw after 48 moves. Instead, White can try another 1 9th move.

White only has one pawn for the exchange, but it's a strong one. If he wants, he can return it with 24.c7 to restore the material balance. The knight on d6 is strong, but since the pawn on e5 is also a slight weakness, White has no way to gain an advantage. In this example, both sides had strong pawn levers to play for. It was a question of time; if Black had been first with ... f6, he would have gained the initiative with his strong bishop on g7.

Black is slightly better with control over the open file, but to get something out of the position, he needs to play with the pawns. Since Black has control of the position, he can choose whether to advance his pawn majority or the pawn minority. However, firstly it's White to move.
25.f4!
This pawn lever weakens the king, but it creates open files for White's pieces. It's seldom good just to defend passively. 25 ... Y"d6 26.fx:e5?
26.c4! was a good option, forcing Black's rook to leave the open file.
26 ... gxe5 27.Y"f3 Y"e7 28.h3 After a few natural moves, Black has to decide which plan to opt for. To me, it doesn't look realistic to advance the kingside pawns, since it opens the king too much. A minority attack is thus the most logical plan. 28 .• . h6! Not hurrying - avoiding tempo-winning threats against the back rank. Chapter 1 - No Pawn Lever - No Plan 23
29.gfl
With 29.1:'!dl White could also claim an open file. In the endgame, the file furthest away from the king is better in principle, because the entry squares are harder to protect. However, king safety is still a motif, and Black holds a small advantage. Starting with 29 ...b5 Black may hope to divert White's pieces to the queenside, before attacking the king. 29 ... a5 I think it's better to start with 29 ... b5 as 30.'1Wa8t lith? 3 1 .'1Wxa6 doesn't work because 3 1 .. . 1:'!el t wins - a line that shows the difference in king safety.
[diagram]
How should White react on the queenside? I never know in such positions, but I always have the feeling that everyone else knows. When I asked a friend he said exactly the same thing - that he doesn't know but believes that others do. It seems we should not be dejected if we experience that chess is difficult. What I will do instead is to go through all possible reactions, one by one: 1) Leaving the pawns as they stand will not work, since Black can threaten the one on a2. 2) b2-b4 doesn't look good, since White will never be able to coordinate his pieces to advance his pawn majority. If the pawns can't advance, it's just weakening. 3) a2-a4 leaves a pawn undefended. If Black has the time to attack it, with for example ...g6, ... lffg7 and ... l:!e4, b2-b3 may be the only good defending move. Then it's starting to look like White has too many weaknesses. 4) a2-a3 allows the minority attack with ...b5-b4, but White exchanges twice and is left with an isolated passed pawn on b2. One weak pawn is not enough. To win, Black must keep one of his own pawns on the queenside. Instead, Black might go for ... a4 and ...b5, fixing the majority. The pawn on b5 looks as weak as b2, but the important question is whether Black can advance his majority. It seems risky, but if he takes one step at a time with ... g6, ...Qg7, ... h5, ...h4, ...f5, ...g5, it's not clear how White should react. It doesn't seem pleasant.

5) b2-b3 and c3-c4 builds a pawn chain. To make progress, Black can try ...a4. IfWhite doesn't react, he might play ... a3 with a dangerous pawn due to E!:b2-ideas later, or he might play ...axb3 followed by an attack against the b3-pawn. Probably White is better advised to play b3xa4, in a moment when c4 is defended. Some counterplay along the b-file might arise. It's still a mystery to me which is the best option, but none seems pleasant. Let's see how the game continued.

Consider the future pawn moves in the following position, to decide which knight White should capture. Smith 2012
[diagram]
1 .l2lxg6 hxg6 gives Black doubled pawns. However, the g-pawns still work just as well to stop White's pawn majority. They have no intention of moving (other than to capture) and are quite easy to defend since they are close to the king. So the right choice is: I.ttlxc6! dxc6 With pawn majorities on both sides, the main plan is to create a passed pawn. The doubled pawns make that impossible for Black. The game might continue: 2.f5 tlJfS 3.ge7 gd7

Pawn levers When you know which pawn lever to play for, it's much easier to find the best positions for the pieces. In the following four positions, your task is to find a desired pawn lever and look for a way to carry it out. Sometimes preparatory moves are needed, sometimes not. I propose using a total of twenty minutes for the first four positions.

White has a healthier pawn structure, more active rook and a statically better bishop. Black's only hope is that the pawns on f5 and e4 will manage to keep White's bishop passive, but that pawn wall is much too fragile. It is time for White to combine his advantages by opening the diagonal for the bishop to pick up the b7-pawn.

If Black doesn't react, White exchanges on f5, plays J.h3 and finally gets control over e4. Instead after 33.f3 exd3 34.exd3 Black has the resource 34 ...f4! so White seeks other ways. 33 ... J.e5?! I tried to defend with the help of tactics. 33 ...exd3 is best, but after 34.J.d5t �e8

I entered this pawn structure with the hope that the bishop on h4 was out of play, but I forgot to think about a reasonable plan for White. There is none! The kingside is closed and it seems suicidal to push the pawns on the queenside, in front of my king. & a matter of fact, the bishop on h4 is doing a great job. Black's plan is simply to play ...h5 and double or triple behind the pawn. White must play h2-h3 to keep the pawn structure intact. After that, Black follows with ... Bg3 and chooses when to open the h-file. Agrest started with 1 6. ..h5.

With his light-squared bishop, Black wants to get some compensation for his worse pawn structure, but to do that he needs to get some pawn play. That isn't easy!

17.exd4!
The d4-pawn controls e5 and c5, two squares where Black's knight may have wanted to jump, and it also closes the diagonal for the black bishop on g7. The fact that the pawn is isolated doesn't bother White, since it is easily defended. The only positive thing about Black's position is the square on d5, but that alone isn't enough to create any play. When I started to look for pawn levers to open the position, I couldn't find any. For his part, White is happy to keep the position closed, since he has clear weaknesses to play against. His plan is to attack Black's queenside pawns and take control of the weak squares on the queenside. White is slightly better. 17 ...

Nine days later it was Grandelius's turn to face Agrest. Once again - surprise! - he soon found himself in a position without pawn levers. In the position above, Black has a backward pawn on c7, and he will never be able to free himself with ...c6, since White has too many pieces controlling that square. White can choose whether to play on the queenside, in the centre or on the kingside - or combine all of these. White is clearly better.

For several months I wondered how Agrest managed to stop us from getting any counterplay at all. One day, I finally realized what he did: he strived for positions where his opponent had no achievable pawn levers. It felt like a very important insight, and "No pawn lever - no plan" has been my motto ever since. On the 9th of June I had a training session with Nils Grandelius on that theme, and a month later we both played Agrest again, this time in the Swedish Championship.

The theme should be clear by now - Black is lacking good pawn levers. The best would be to play ...e5, but the pawn on d5 would become too weak. White's long-term plan is to advance the pawn majority on the queenside. Before he did this, Agrest improved his knight with tLlc3-b l -d2-f3-e5 and gained space on the kingside with g2-g3 and h2-h4.

It looks like a Catalan, but actually started as a Semi-Slav. There is no doubt Black wants to achieve the pawn lever ...c5, since it opens the diagonal for the bishop, the c-file for a rook and exchanges the backward c-pawn. With White to move, t2Jb3 would take complete control over c5. I didn't hesitate.

lfz-lfz When I finally managed to carry out a pawn lever against Agrest, I went to the restroom and celebrated with Grandelius. The game also brought me half a point. However, the story didn't end there. The next year Lund played against Sollentuna in the Swedish Team Championship, where Agrest is both a player and team captain. In Sweden, it's possible to change the board order from rating order, but only two steps up or down. Since Agrest usually takes White, it was not difficult to figure out that he would play on the second board. I volunteered to face him.

The game started with the usual story. In the diagram position, White dominates the d-file while Black's rook is tied to the defence of the a-pawn. In addition, my seventh rank is weak. White's plan is probably to walk his king to b2 and then open up the kingside in one way or another. However, I was eager to carry out my pawn levers before it was too late. 26 ...h5!?

At the same time it's a double-edged decision, since ...gxf5 weakens my king. Anyway, I thought that anything was better than waiting for Agrest to stop all my pawn levers, like so many times before.

Agrest also takes an interesting positional decision. He makes the bishop on c2 passive, but wins a tempo which keeps the position closed until White's king has reached the queenside. 29 •. . .le6 30.'tt> e2

It is time to decide which pieces to keep and which to exchange. White's pawn structure is better, since his candidate for promotion is an outside pawn, while my candidate is the e-pawn, which is easy to stop for White's king. Therefore I should keep the queens and play against White's king. When White starts to advance his majority - his only winning try - I should be able to find perpetual checks.

1-0 So far, we have learned that against Agrest, pawn levers are necessary to have a plan at all. How is it against other opponents? Pawn lever and plan can't be synonyms. Two other options are playing with the initiative against uncoordinated pieces, and attacking a chronic weakness. That requires, of course, that the opponent has either badly-placed pieces or a weakness. Do I have to say that Agrest usually avoids both these things? So what is a chronic weakness? It is something that cannot run away easily, such as: A The king A A weak pawn A A weak square The idea is actually similar to lossif Dorfman's Move Search Algorithm, which he presented in The Method in Chess. His idea was to measure the static balance in a position according to the following four factors, in decreasing order of importance: A The king's position A Material A Who has the better position after the exchange of queens? A Pawn formation The player who has a disadvantage concerning the static factors has to play dynamically. Pawn levers are one way of doing so! I want to show a masterpiece by UlfAndersson to illustrate how to play against a chronic weakness. Andersson was one of the best players in the world in the seventies and eighties, even though he was not interested in competing in the Candidates Cycle. In 1 994 he started to play correspondence chess. Many of his opponents already used computers, but Ulf just sat in a cafe and analysed all day. And all night. For eight years. Listening to him explaining his games is the most valuable chess experience I have ever had. In one training session with Grandelius and me, Andersson showed his game against the highest-rated correspondence chess player, Gert Timmerman. After 20 moves, he had created a chronic weakness in his opponent's camp and could play without pawn levers. I know I can't live up to his comments, but here is the game:

The Keres Attack - the reason the Scheveningen isn't played so often at the top level nowadays. The Najdorf move order with 5 ... a6 and 6 ...e6 has instead become more popular, because the bishop on c8 stops g2-g4 for another move when the pawn stays on e7. However, there are also some things that argue in favour of using the Scheveningen move order. Against the Najdorf, 6.i.g5 is one of the popular responses, but that bishop move loses its bite when Black hasn't spent a tempo on ...a6. There are also other lines where ...a6 may become superfluous. 6 ... h6 7.h4 tLlc6 SJ�gl

I think one of the keys to Andersson's way of thinking is the concept of outposts. An outpost is a good square for a piece, either for offensive or defensive tasks. The piece is defended by

a pawn, and it's difficult for the opponent to 25 •• J�e4 threaten it with a pawn. However, it doesn't Threatening the bishop on d4. have to be completely cemented, only safe for a reasonable number of moves. 26.Y"b2 In this position, Andersson is a pawn down but has an outpost on c6, where it's natural to place the bishop. For White, the c6-square can be said to be a chronic weakness in his pawn structure - he lacks the b- and d-pawns that could have challenged the square. In addition, White has several other chronic weaknesses. Many pawns are weak, but above all, the king will never be able to find a safe shelter. Black's compensation for the pawn is thus long-term, and he doesn't have to create anything immediate. It's easy to imagine that the engines of 1 994 misevaluated the position. When Andersson showed the game, he said: "It's at least a draw. I have some pressure, and when he didn't manage to solve his problems, I started to look for more." '�t least a draw" is only an expression of Andersson's mentality. When he says that, he is already better. The diagram position is favourable for Black, and it's interesting to see how Andersson managed to create a winning position without moving a single pawn for the next 1 9 moves. 20 ••• Y"a5 21J:�g3 gads 22.�d4 .Ba4 Andersson decides to play simply with ... tDc6xd4.

0-1 Andersson: "This is one of the games I am most satisfied with." When I asked Andersson about the final standings in the tournament, he only knew that he had won. That's typical; Andersson played only to "analyse positions and send some moves". In another game, he had to decide whether to play ... V!Je7 or ... l�Hc8 first. He spent five hours a day for two weeks, while being on vacation on Majorca. It turned out that there was no difference between the moves; he played both. Andersson won the tournament with 1 1 Yz/ 14, one point in front of Timmerman, and became the new Number 1 on the ICCF (International Correspondence Chess Federation) rating list. However, he was happy when he stopped playing; it was too exhausting. There were many weaknesses to attack in the game above. If there is neither a weakness, nor an achievable pawn lever to play for, like in many of the games against Agrest, it's difficult to find a good plan. That's why pawn levers are the first thing to look for when creating a plan. Many of the positions against Agrest looked quite grim, but it can also happen that a position looks nice and yet no good plan is apparent. Here is an example that confused me for more than a year. Brede Kvisvik - Edwin David Kristiansund 1 7th September 20 1 1 I.e4 e6 2.d4 d5 3.tllc3 .Bb4 4.e5 b6 5.a3 .i£8 This is an unusual line. Black does not mind losing time with his bishop.

White has space in the centre, but since Black plays the French, I guess he is happy with his lot. However, Black's pieces on the kingside are stepping on each other. Especially the knight on g8 seems difficult to develop. White also has a lead in development, so it's natural to look for a pawn lever. b2-b3 is well answered with ...b5, so f2- f4-f5 is the only possibility. Unfortunately all White's pieces are wrongly placed. The rook Chapter 1 - No Pawn Lever - No Plan 43 has moved from the f-file, the bishop stops it from going back, and the knight blocks the f-pawn. So even though White's position looks good, it's difficult for him to find a plan. I think White made an instructive mistake with 8.llJf3?!. If he had played the temporary pawn sacrifice 8.f4 instead, he would have had the possibility to play f4-f5 later. The next question is how to evaluate the diagram position. I thought it was pleasant for Black, since he had the possibility of advancing his pawns on the queenside. He can also try to control f5 by playing ...h5 and ... llJh6. I wasn't bothered that Houdini disagreed, giving an evaluation of +0.32. However, Hans Tikkanen argued for White's position. He noticed that White is able to close the queenside if he plays llJc3-e2. He can then answer ...b4 with a3-a4 and either ...b3 with c2-c3 or ...c3 with b2-b3. White's progress on the kingside is slow, but still exists. If he manages to play g2-g4 and llJg3, he might get time to go for f2-f4 later. White should also take care, though, since Black may castle long and attack the king if White opens up too much. It's interesting that it's difficult for both sides to find a good plan, since they both have problems achieving a pawn lever. The position is quite balanced. The game actually ended in a win for Black in 67 moves, but the moves are not relevant to our theme. Prophylaxis Prophylactic moves defend against your opponent's threats before they appear, and sometimes they may stop his entire plan. And since a plan is so strongly connected to a pawn lever, this is what you should look for, exactly as Evgenij Agrest does. I will show two games where one of the players finds a prophylactic move which stops the opponent's pawn levers. The first game below was played by Mr Prophylaxis himself, Tigran Petrosian.

One rule of thumb I have used in the King's Indian is to play ...c5 when White has played .Bg5. It makes sense, since the bishop is controlling neither b2 nor d4. However, I am sure there are many exceptions to that rule! 7 . .te3 e5 8.d5 c6 9.h4 cxd5 10.cxd5 c!Llbd7 In the King's Indian, Black normally plays for the pawn lever ... f5. When he played 6 ...h6 he left the pawn on f7 as the only defender of the g6-square. For that reason, it's less probable now that Black will manage to play ... f5. Petrosian continues to stop the pawn lever forever.

White has three minor pieces that can control the light squares and Black two - giving White a 3-2 advantage. For every exchange, White's advantage increases, since 2- 1 and 1-0 are proportionally greater differences than 3-2. In chess terms, the reason is that only one piece can occupy a square, but many can threaten it. White thus wants to exchange Black's minor pieces - except the ugly bishop on g7.

Black will probably have to play ... ibd6 sooner or later, after which White exchanges and plays the knight to c4 or d3, winning material. Looking at Black's position, I want to put the bishop on a6 to be able to play ... ibxc4. Unfortunately, I can't find a way to be in time to defend the pawn on a5 and stop d5-d6 at the same time.

Black's pawn lever is clearly ...c5. Black should postpone developing his kingside and try to carry it out as soon as possible.

White's pawn formation with d4 and f4 makes his centre really solid, so he is strategically justified in attacking on the kingside with g2- g4-g5 . Before this advance is carried out, it makes a lot of sense to play two prophylactic moves against Black's counterplay.

Now ... a4 is met by b3-b4, or ... b4 with a3-a4. Black has no possibility whatsoever of starting an attack on White's king, so White can attack 'for free'. Strategically the position is already won, but Houdini's modest assessment of +0. 1 5 suggests that there might be some work left before White can collect the whole point. Mr Prophylaxis had an influence on the last position. In the 7th game of the 1 966 World Championship match, Tigran Petrosian had a similar position against Boris Spassky, but with reversed colours. Petrosian played ...c4 Chapter 1 - No Pawn Lever - No Plan 5 1 followed by ... a6, stopped all counterplay; he won convincingly. Every pawn move weakens at least one square This chapter has been about the advantages of pawn levers. However, it should not be forgotten that the pawns can't move backwards. Therefore, every pawn move also weakens at least one square. This is explained most easily by going back to one of my positions against Evgenij Agrest, shown in the beginning of the chapter. Evgenij Agrest -Axd Smith Sigeman & Co, Malmo 24th April 2008
[diagram]
I have already concluded that White is slightly better, since Black doesn't have any good pawn levers. It's time to think about the reason. When I played ...gxf6 earlier in the game, I thought that the slight weakness in my pawn structure wasn't problematic. The doubled pawns aren't weak, and I didn't worry too much about my king either. In my most optimistic thoughts, I even saw myself using the g-file for one of my rooks. The main disadvantage with doubled pawns is that they are static and have difficulties advancing, which is mostly a problem if they are part of a pawn majority. That's no big problem in the diagram position, since Black has no plans to advance the kingside pawns. What I didn't think of was what squares were weakened by ...gxf6. It permanently weakened all the squares on the h-file and slightly weakened the squares on the f-file. The squares on the h-file aren't that important, but the 'semi-weakened' squares on the f-file are actually what decide the fate of Black's bishop! With the fS-pawn still on g6, I would have been able to carry out the pawn lever ...e5 and get a nice position. But since the pawn is on the f-file, I need to keep the e-pawn on e6 to protect the fS-square. It took me months before I figured out that ...gxf6 prevented me from freeing my bishop with ... e5, but it felt like a real eye-opener when I understood it. Isn't it enlightening that the biggest disadvantage with a pawn move ( ... gxf6) is that another pawn can't move? It says something about the importance of pawn levers. It's actually possible to formulate a general principle: when you make a pawn capture to a file, you have to be cautious when moving the pawn on the adjoining file. In this case, Black captured something on the f-file with ... gxf6, and thus has to be careful when moving the e-pawn; the other neighbour to the f-file. It can also be formulated in another way: you have to be careful when moving pawns whose neighbour doesn't have a neighbour. It's the same if the neighbour exists, but has advanced. Hence, moving pawns that have one empty file in between them weakens the same squares. For example, d2-d4 and f2-f4 often don't look good together. This is why the opening from the previous example, the Stonewall, does not have a good reputation with some people.

Ulf Andersson once made a legendary comment about a game which started with l .f4: "Black is already slightly better!" Moving the f-pawn weakens the a7-gl diagonal and thus the position of the king. It weakens the second rank for the endgame, but it also semi weakens the squares on the e-file and makes d2-d4 less attractive. To conclude that Black is already slightly better is maybe a bit too much, but the point is clear enough. Well, this is just a rule of thumb, and as I made clear in the introduction, it should be used mainly when practising or during limited periods. One day the intuition will hopefully warn against a pawn move that is too weakening; the knowledge will have been transformed into a subconscious skill. Doubled pawns are mainly a weakness when they advance. This is not surprising, since the pawn capture already weakened a lot of squares.

In the diagram position, both sides have doubled pawns but the disadvantages with them are not the same. When White played I O.bxc3, he weakened the squares on the c-file. Since he has also moved the neighbour (the d-pawn), the c4-square has become permanently weak. As White has a pawn there, Black can try to attack it. It would be even worse for White if he played l l .d5?!, which weakens the square on c5. With 7 ... gxf6, Black weakened the squares on the f-file. By then, he had already moved his e-pawn three squares forward. For that reason, the squares on f4 and f5 are permanently weak. Black's f-pawns have not moved and are therefore not weak in themselves; White can't attack them. The position is balanced, since neither c4 nor f5 is easy to attack with more than one piece. The game ended in a draw after 44 moves, but didn't illustrate the theme, so I shall stop here. Of course there certainly can be many positions where pawn moves are justified even though they weaken squares.

gd6! Black stops liJg5 but also takes control over the important e5-square. At the same time, there are two disadvantages with the move. 1 ) The pawn on f6 gets isolated. However, since Black has his pawn majority on the queenside, there's no reason to advance the f-pawn further. The pawn is quite safe if it stays close to the king. 2) ...gxf6 also weakens the squares on the h-file and the f-file. Since Black is also missing his e-pawn, the squares on f4 and f5 become permanently weak. Anyway, I think Brynell chose the lesser of two evils. In the game, I began by doubling on the e-file to avoid the exchange of rooks. Then, I tried to manoeuvre the knights to f4 and f5.

Every pawn move weakens some squares, and ... exf6 compromised Black's ability to attack the d4-square. So how should Black play? A good strategic idea is to put a knight on d5.

Black has managed to execute his strategy. However, White is still okay, since he has good control over d4. The game ended in a draw in 58 moves. To sum up what has been learned: If the opponent has no chronic weaknesses and there are no achievable pawn levers, there is a risk that it may be impossible to find a good plan. For that reason, pawn levers are very important to consider. There are many reasons to play for pawn levers; to open up for the pieces, attack the opponent's king, take control over the centre or improve the pawn structure. However, every pawn move also weakens at least one square. One therefore has to be careful when moving a pawn if one of the pawns two files away has been exchanged or has advanced. I am sure I have many tough games against Evgenij Agrest in front of me, and I will surely find myself in positions where my pawn levers have been stopped. However, I will never forget that planning in chess often starts with finding out which pawn lever the position calls for. That's the take-home message of this chapter: always look for pawn levers, both your own and the ones of your opponent. It will make the rest much easier. Chapter 2 Club: Arboga SK Born: 1 95 1

About piece exchanges and material imbalances Ska vi byta? ("Wanna exchange stuff?") is a famous Swedish children's song by artist and chess enthusiast Hasse Alfredson. He exchanges a toy car for a rusty screw, then the screw for a yellow balloon, the balloon for an electric guitar, and so on. It doesn't concern anyone at all that the various items seem to have different values. Fair exchange is no robbery - they are both happy with the exchanges. It's the same in chess: sometimes you shouldn't mind exchanging a rook for a tricky knight. To be a bit more serious, piece exchanges are some of the most important strategical decisions and will be discussed in the first part of the chapter. The subject of the second part is something that's always difficult to evaluate: positions with material imbalances. The imbalances that are covered are bishop against knight, bishop or knight against rook, two minor pieces against rook, two rooks against queen, three minor pieces against queen, rook plus minor piece against queen, and minor piece against three pawns. Opposite-coloured bishops are also added to the list. UlfAndersson is the chapter's model player. He has already had one game in the book, against Timmerman. In that game, Andersson was a pawn down but had long-term compensation due to his safer king. I wrote that he often thinks in terms of outposts, but he also has a fantastic feeling for the pieces. He is never in a hurry, and methodically improves his pieces, step by step. It is like he always knows where they want to be. Piece exchanges There are many different reasons to exchange pieces. The three most common causes are that you have a material advantage, that the opponent has more space, or simply that the opponent's piece is better. An exchange can also be based on a transition to the endgame; with a better endgame or a worse middlegame, it's generally good to exchange pieces. The most obvious example is exchanging queens when you have an exposed king. The pawn structure can set the strategical reason for piece exchanges. With a better pawn majority far away from the king, it's often good to exchange heavy pieces, but when playing against an isolated pawn, it's instead good to exchange minor pieces. Actually, it's generally good to exchange pieces if you are conducting a strategically-justified attack against a weakness. The last case that will be mentioned in this part of the chapter is when you have two against-one of a particular piece. An exchange, for example of a bishop for a knight, can also be based on something other than the demands of the position. It is simply easier to outplay a weaker opponent when the material is imbalanced. However, such situations will not be covered here. The worst piece Sometimes the strategy of a whole game can rely only on a piece exchange, as in one of Ulf Andersson's correspondence games which we shall see below. I was very impressed by the apparent effortlessness of the game and was happy that I had recorded Ulf when he showed me the game. When Andersson demonstrates a game his gestures and mimicry are fascinating; it's possible to see in his face when he evaluates a move as bad. Those visual effects are lost when his comments are transcribed below, but nevertheless the words give a good picture of how he thinks. Enjoy!

Two things decided the game; the small weakness on the kingside after the exchange of dark-squared bishops and, later, the square on d5. Nothing else; it was enough. *** That is the end ofUlf Andersson's annotations. I really like White's simple plan of exchanging Black's fianchettoed bishop. That bishop was maybe not the strongest piece to use actively, but it was important for the black king's safety. It's also instructive to see Andersson's comments at move 32. It is generally good to exchange pieces when having a material advantage, but many players overdo it. In the game, Andersson even gave back a pawn to keep the bishops on the board. A bishop is usually defined as bad if it's blocked by its own pawns. For that reason, it's usually good to exchange such a bad bishop if we have one. However, it's not that simple. Grandelius pointed out that a bishop seldom is bad if a player has more space. 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 Smith 2012 1 !::: :.
[diagram]
The pawn on d5 is very strong. With more space, White's pieces have influence on both sides of the board, while Black's pieces are more limited. Black also has to think twice before carrying out the pawn lever ...e6 or ... e5 since White will play d5xe6 and give Black an isolated pawn on d6 (if he recaptures with a piece on e6) or hanging pawns (in case of ... fxe6). White's plan can be to try a kingside attack with h4-h5, or double rooks on the e-file. Firstly, he has to decide whether to exchange bishops. I..tb3! White's bishop is technically bad on b3, since it's blocked by its own pawn on d5. But there are a lot of reasons to keep it. Without the bishop, Black would get counterplay on the queenside, with the aim of exchanging queens in order to prevent White from attacking the king. On b3, the bishop shields b2 and defends c2 and d5. At the same time, Black's bishop doesn't have any clear tasks at all. White is better after l . .Bb3! and can start with one of his plans, attacking the king with h4- h5 or doubling rooks on the e-file with �e3. So somewhat surprisingly, it was best to keep the bishops. The game is as much about pawn structure as about piece exchanges, but strategical themes never work alone. Good and bad pieces are defined only in connection with the rest of the pawns and pieces. Lessspace With a lot of space, it's usually good to avoid exchanges. An interesting question arose in the next game, which is an old classic. Friorik Olafsson earned the Grandmaster title after the previous round, so this was his first game as a Grandmaster.

The position has three happy bishops, all fianchettoed. The fourth bishop has not yet found a good square! White's long-term plan is to carry out the pawn lever b4-b5, not only grabbing space on the queenside but also undermining the squares on the long diagonal. Since Black lacks good outposts on the queenside, it makes sense to force him to keep pieces that are placed there.

White follows up with a2-a3 and later b3- b4, with an advantage. Instead, 6lafsson played 1 3.a3?! tDxc2
14.'1Wxc2, but still managed to win after 59
moves. Technically, White doesn't have more space in the diagram position, but since it's easy for him to push a2-a3 and b3-b4, he should have kept as many pieces as possible on the board. The only pieces to exchange may be the dark squared bishops, trying to weaken Black's king in the same manner as in Andersson's game. So White should have kept the pieces on the board, since his plan was to grab more space. And with too many piece exchanges, it can even become a burden to have more space. Smith 2012
[diagram]
White has gained space on both wings. With a few minor pieces on the board, that would be an advantage since it would have been easier for White to find good squares for the pieces. In the following endgame, White is instead unhappy with all his space, because there aren't enough pieces to cover all the weak squares. l. .. :gxal! 2.:gxal �c7t 3.f4

Black played l. .. �e4. Is it a good move? Many moves should lead to a draw, but that doesn't mean that the different moves are of equal value. After the game, the discussions were lively. Stojanovic assessed his opponent's move as okay, but the Ukrainian Grandmaster Aleksandar Goloshapov considered it to be a big strategical mistake. I agree with him. Firstly, White's king is weaker. Black can try to attack with l ...E:e3 2.Wff2. It doesn't lead to anything special, but White is tied up. Secondly, White controls the file furthest away from the opponent's king, which is an advantage in the ending.

It's still easily drawn, but the decision to exchange queens was a strategic mistake anyway. Instead, Black played 4 ... E:d7 and lost after a mistake later on. Simply stated: if one player has a better middlegame and the second player potentially a better endgame, then the second player wants to exchange pieces. However, there is a big difference between exchanging minor and heavy pieces. The following example illustrates that different pieces should be exchanged in different kinds of endgame.

It's good to have rooks when trying to control an outside passed pawn. A good setup for Black is with the bishop on a8 and the rook on the eighth rank. Black has to fish for counterplay with his knight. Grandelius was afraid ofWhite's initiative with Wfb6 followed by E:c7, but exchanging rooks is the greater evil.

d4! 35.hd4 .Be6 36.'i!?fl 1/2-l!:z So why are heavy pieces important when trying to stop outside passed pawns? One reason is that they can attack and blockade the pawn at the same time. Bishop and knights can only do one of these things. That also explains why it's best to keep heavy pieces when pressing against a weak pawn. A heavy piece can block a pawn while attacking it. However, with bishops or knights on the board, it might not be easy to find a safe blockading square in front of the pawn. That's why the player who plays against an isolated pawn should exchange minor pieces but keep heavy ones. When the passed pawn is in the middle of the board, the situation is actually the opposite; the defender wants to exchange heavy pieces. By doing this, the king can join the defence. The same strategy doesn't work against outside passed pawns, since the king is a very slow piece. Sometimes, the piece constellation defines who wants to exchange pieces, like the position after 25 moves in the following game.

1-0 With a material imbalance, a rule of thumb is to exchange if you have two pieces of the same type. Often, the second piece doesn't work as well as the first. For this rule, remember that the light- and dark-squared bishops count as two different types of piece. Controlling squares Another situation when it's advantageous to exchange is when playing to control weak squares.

The fianchetto solves the problem of developing his light-squared bishop, but the light squares on the queenside will become weak if the bishop is exchanged. Therefore, White should try to exchange the light-squared bishops. This is exactly what he does with his next move.

Black made a good decision and stopped White's plan. Still, it was in White's favour to insert the pawn moves. If he, for instance, manages to play c4-c5, the pawn on b6 (if White plays cxb6) or the pawn on a5 (if Black plays ...bxc5) might become weak. After exchanging the light-squared bishops, White has gained good control over the light squares. It's still not easy to make progress, and the rest of the game is not important for the theme. White won in 47 moves. The strategy of exchanging off defenders only works if the attack is strategically justified. In the next example, White again plays to increase his control over a weak square by exchanging the opponent's defenders. If White had fewer pieces than Black controlling the key square, every exchange would instead have given the opposite effect.

The same method can be used when attacking other weaknesses. A chronic weakness was in the previous chapter defined as something that doesn't disappear easily: a pawn, a square or the king. Hence, it's logical that a strategically-justified attack on the king can be enhanced by exchanging off defending pieces. This is exactly what Alexander Alekhine did, as Lars Bo Hansen pointed out in Foundations of Chess Strategy. While Mikhail Tal attacked in a normal manner by throwing all his pieces into the attack, Alekhine attacked by luring away or exchanging the opponent's defenders. Still, there must be more attacking than defending pieces for the exchanging method to work. Only then is the attack strategically justified. It doesn't even need to look like an attack on the king when the exchange takes place, as in the following example. Axel Smith - Tobias Restgaard H. C. Andersen Mindgames, Odense 1 9th May 20 1 2

There are many different reasons to exchange pieces. The following list is a short summary. A. The opponent's piece is better A. The opponent has more space A. You have a worse middlegame or a better endgame A. With a weak king, it's good to exchange queens A. With a better pawn majority far away from the king, it is good to exchange heavy pieces A. Playing against weak pawns, it is good to exchange minor pieces A. You have two against one of that particular piece A. There is a strategically-justified attack against a weakness A. You have a material advantage Material imbalances The most common situation with a material imbalance is when one of the players has won a pawn or a piece, but those are not so interesting. What's usually meant is instead when the two sides have different pieces, like a rook against a bishop or a bishop against a knight. I think studying such positions is a good way to learn about the pieces. In positions with material imbalances, their weak and strong characteristics become apparent. I will examine bishop against knight, opposite-coloured bishops, exchange sacrifices, two minor pieces against a rook, queen against two rooks, queen against three minor pieces, and queen against rook and piece. Some of the examples will also include pieces exchanges, others not. When we started to play chess, we learned a points system to evaluate material imbalances. Today, I would be happy if I could forget it. Much more important than comparing the static value of the pieces that have been captured is looking at what the pieces on the board are doing. A bishop can be stronger than a rook, in some circumstances. Before writing this chapter, I collected guidelines to the different pieces. However, I soon noticed that there are so many general principles that they always oppose each other in some way. Ideally, the principles should be learned, understood and forgotten. More is written about this in the introduction. A general rule might even be harmful. One example is "Two pawns on the sixth rank are worth a rook". As I see it, it's almost exclusively concrete factors that determine the evaluation of the position in such cases. The same is valid for the points system: it is useful to know, but every position must be evaluated separately. Hence I think the examples and principles should be understood, but used only with caution. Five of the following positions would work well for training games, with a rapid time control or even longer. I think it's good to play with an increment to give the time control less impact. I have marked those suitable positions with: Training position. There are four additional training positions at the end of the chapter. Bishop against knight The most common material imbalance is bishop against knight. One important factor

when evaluating such positions is the other bishop - has it been exchanged or not? The bishops are much stronger when they are a pair. In 1 999, GM Larry Kaufman used several hundred thousand games to run statistical analyses, and later used his findings when he helped develop the piece algorithm for the chess engine Rybka. He argued that having the bishop pair would by itself give another Yz point (half a pawn), compared to the normal points system. That's interesting to know, but still not a strict rule. It often makes sense to retreat with the pair of bishops to avoid exchanging one of them. The bishops may be passive for some time, but will hit back in the endgame. 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 Smith 2012

A typical position from the King's Indian Attack. White has the bishop pair, but for the moment the light-squared bishop is passive and the dark-squared bishop is threatened by an exchange. However, since the bishop pair is mainly an endgame advantage, White does best to retreat. l..icl This is better than l . .Bd2, since it leaves the square on d2 free for the knight. White's plan is to gain space on the queenside. It also makes sense to improve the position of the light squared bishop - maybe with the manoeuvre .Bg2-fl . White is slightly better. The bishop pair is mostly strong, but a single bishop risks becoming bad since it can only control half of the squares on the board. The following example shows why it's important to keep other pieces on the board, when having a single bishop against a knight.

From move five, when Black recaptured with the e-pawn on f6, White has played for the endgame. Black's doubled pawns are bad in different ways. The doubled pawns on the a-file are weak since it is difficult to defend the a7 -pawn if the queens come off. The doubled pawns on the f-file are not at risk of being lost, Chapter 2 - Fair Exchange is No Robbery 73 but they damage Black's pawn majority on the kingside; Black will not manage to create a passed pawn there. Black's pair of bishops is not active for the moment, but he should keep them as they might become strong later. 20 •• • a5?! Sacrificing the flank pawns is quite common in the middlegame, but often players forget that it's not the same in the endgame. It's useful to capture such pawns!

A friend noted that the bishop on a8 looks like a soldier on top of a mountain, who is searching for his comrades with binoculars. The problem is that the comrades are far away, and he is looking straight into a tree. The bishop on a8 moves (well...) on the same colour as the pawn on c6. That's the definition of a bad bishop, especially when there are central pawns fixed on the same colour. However, often it's not so simple to define good and bad bishops - a "bad" bishop might, for example, be fulfilling a vital defensive task. It's easier to see if a knight is strong or not. They are normally best placed on an outpost in the centre or on a good blockading square. However, it happens less often that strong knights dominate a game. One reason is that the bishops have "the power of exchange" - it's Chapter 2 - Fair Exchange is No Robbery 75 easier to capture a strong knight with a bishop than vice versa. The player who exchanges the bishop for a knight often gets something other than a strong knight in return. It can be a pawn, extra space, time or some other advantage. He should then base his forthcoming play on this imbalance. The positions where the side with the knight has a development advantage are especially interesting. It's often in that player's interest to open up the position, even if it's said that the bishop is at its best in open positions. The idea is to try to decide the game or get another type of advantage before the endgame, when the bishop reaches its full strength. The following exchange might be a bit surprising.

Grandelius's game never reached the position where he could play l l ...ix:d4!?. As I see it, the move sacrifices some material but Black gets an initiative in return. In the variations we analysed, Black didn't try to get a strong knight but instead used his lead in development. Opposite-coloured bishops If there are heavy pieces on the board, opposite coloured bishops favour the side that is playing with an active plan. An attack is much easier to carry out with a clear dominance over either the light or dark squares. To stop such an attack, the defender can place his pawns on the opposite colour to his bishop. Then at least some squares are covered. Without heavy pieces, it's often possible to build a fortress with the pawns on the same colour as the bishop. This setup tends to be very static, but without heavy pieces to worry about, the king might be able to help the defence. The most interesting positions are the ones which are between those situations - with heavy pieces but no attack on the king. The defender can try to build a fortress, but it's not clear if he can cover all the weak squares. He can also try to set up an aggressive defence with the pawns on the opposite colour to the bishop, but that is risky since the pawns might become weak.

[diagram]
Chapter 2 - Fair Exchange is No Robbery 77 White is a pawn up, but with both pairs of rooks exchanged it would be an easy draw. White's main plan is to advance his pawn majority - the e- and f-pawns. To do this, he needs to support them with the king. For that reason Black should avoid exchanging on d l , since that would help the white king to cross the d-file. Black also wants to place his king in front of the pawn majority, but he cannot cross the d-file either. With opposite-coloured bishops, it's an interesting question how Black should arrange his pawns on the kingside. ...g5 followed by ...f6 gives safe pawns, but may allow White's king to penetrate to g6. The more active approach is to play ... f5, but it might just result in additional weaknesses. To be completely passive is a bad idea: 20 ...b6 2 1 .:gad2! :gxd2 22.:gxd2
[diagram]
White has exchanged Black's rook on the d-file but keeps the second rook, since Black can't play 22 ... :gd8 due to 23 . .Bb7t. White will play i>dl-e2 and start to advance the kingside pawns. After e3-e4, f2-f4, h3-h4 (with the king on g3) and g4-g5, he will open up with f4-f5. It seems like a winning position. I think Black would be happy to play ... c6 followed by ...�c7. The c-pawn is placed on a light square to cover d5. The immediate 20 ... c6!? might be worth a try. However, White has several interesting options after 2 1 .bxc6 bxc6 22.hc6 :gxh3.
[diagram]
White can exchange rooks and try to get the bishop to e8 or he can try to keep both rooks to play for an attack on the king. In principle, I don't believe in Black's position, since the bishop isn't stable on c5. Instead, Black's two main candidate moves are 20 ... f5 and 20 ...g5, the active and passive defence. a) 20 ...5 Hillarp thought this was right, saying Black was strategically lost if he defended passively. However, Ulf Andersson, who had his 60th birthday while the game was played, dismissed ... f5 on principle. He thought it just created an additional weakness. Both Hillarp's and Andersson's reasoning sounds logical, but they can't both be right! I tried to gain some clarity by analysing the position with Grandelius and Tikkanen. Nothing has helped, but here is my best try to find a logical line. 2U�d5!? gxd5 22.hd5 �d7 22 ... :gxh3 23.gxf5 gxf5 24 . .Be6t �d8

The defender has a difficult choice between putting up resistance on those squares by placing his pawns on the same colour as the opponent's bishop, or trying to build a fortress with the pawns on the same colour as his own bishop. In the first case, the question is whether the pawns become weak and in the second whether the opponent will penetrate. What is the conclusion in the game above - active or passive defence? If only I knew. .. Hillarp gave me a nice endgame lesson as a gift on my 25th birthday, but it created more questions than answers. Since I need to say something, I would recommend starting with the passive defence (20 ... g5) but continuing with the active (23 ... a6!). After that move, Black has long-term chances of gaining counterplay. Exchange sacrifices The compensation when sacrificing the exchange is often pawn(s) and the pair of bishops, but can also be something else, like an initiative, control over key squares, better pawn structure or a safer king. Also, it's common that the opponent's rooks are temporarily passive, without any open files. I want to point out two other circumstances that often decide if an exchange sacrifice is good. The first circumstance is whether the queens are still on the board. In the middlegame, a rook can sometimes be no stronger than a bishop. There is some truth behind the name - exchange sacrifice. It's often only in the endgame that the rook shows its full strength. In many positions, the player with an extra exchange tries to exchange queens and the evaluation of the position depends a lot on if he manages. This is the case in the first example below. The second circumstance that favours the player who sacrifices the exchange is opposite coloured bishops. In the previous section I mentioned that opposite-coloured bishops generally favour the side which is active. That's often the one who has sacrificed - there must be some reason why he gave up the exchange! The domination of light or dark squares increases the possibility that his play will succeed. The side with the extra exchange has a long term material advantage, but must defend against some play that is not as focused on the long term. The opposite-coloured bishops help such play to succeed, as in the second example. The following game is famous because it was Chapter 2 - Fair Exchange is No Robbery 8 1 Karpov's first loss after he became World Champion. 35 years after the game, I recorded Andersson's thoughts about his exchange sacrifice.

Training position If I had played 1 5.gel without exchanging knights, the d-file would not be open for Black's rook. The reason that I took on f6 was actually a bit embarrassing. It was quite far to the toilets at the Olympiad in Istanbul. Even running back and forth took 2-3 minutes. When Sedlak left the board, I saw my chance to earn a few minutes. Not only would his clock be ticking, but I could also decide on my next move while he was away. He came back after five minutes, and when he took back on f6 with the knight I made my next move immediately. However, the consequences of my early exchange were bigger than I expected. I6 .. J�xd4!?

Fair exchange is no robbery; both players were satisfied. When I played 1 6.ge l , I thought this position was slightly better for White. Black doesn't have anything special in compensation for the exchange - only a pawn and the opposite-coloured bishops. The problem is that White has a hard time finding a plan. It would be ideal to exchange rooks - since I have two - or to exchange off my light-squared bishop. However, those plans aren't achievable, because Black will not allow gd8 and there is nothing to exchange the bishop for! Instead, White has to open more files for the rooks. It is difficult to do anything on the queenside, since Black controls the dark squares. Instead, White's best plan is to push g2-g4-g5. It may Chapter 2 - Fair Exchange is No Robbery 83 not look so convincing, but there is nothing else.
18.Yfe3?!
Consequently, the best move was 1 8.g4. Sedlak evaluated the position as equal; I believe modestly in White. 18• • • Yfxe3 19.fxe3?
[diagram]
1 9.E:xe3 would be equal. Black's dark squared control on the queenside hinders White from opening files, and Black also controls the entry squares on the d-file. My last two moves have involved a queen exchange and a change in the pawn structure. Very critical moments, but I didn't ponder much. I was blinded by Black's possibility to play ...Bd4 followed by ...e5. If he is allowed to do this, the bishop will be at least as strong as one of my rooks and I would be happy if I could sacrifice back the exchange. The e5- square didn't worry me as much. In addition, I was happy that the queens came off, something that's usually good news when an exchange up. There are two reasons why my decision was terrible. The first is that it's actually wrong on principle to exchange the last piece that could defend the dark squares, such as e5 and g5. Black has strategically-justified play on the dark squares, which means that he increases his control with every exchange. It is good for White to reach the endgame, but the problem is that a rook exchange is just a fantasy. That takes us to the second reason why 1 9.fxe3 was bad. It makes White's only plan, to advance the kingside pawns, useless. Instead, White has an e-pawn that will never manage to exchange itsel£
I9. ..
J.a3! Sedlak stops me from playing a2-a3 and b3- b4, to create some counterplay. In the post mortem, he was barely interested in seeing the rest of the game. He simply evaluated the position as lost for White! That may be a bit over the top, but Black's position is at least clearly preferable. At this point in the game, it began to dawn on me what I had done, and I suddenly felt robbed. But exchanged is exchanged - I can't get back my dark-squared bishop. 20J�adl �f8 2I.Bc2 �e7 The king defends d8 to stop White's dream of exchanging rooks.

It is fitting that White's king has four dark squares to choose between, but all of them are covered. The exchange sacrifice showed its full strength when there were opposite-coloured bishops on the board. Different numbers of pieces Material imbalances where one of the players has more pieces than his opponent are special cases. With two minor pieces against a rook, and two rooks or three minor pieces against a queen, the player with more pieces has a static advantage. If he manages to get good outposts for the pieces, he will usually control the position. Chapter 2 - Fair Exchange is No Robbery 85 What the player with the single piece wants to do is create dynamic play. This is important to remember, and a recurring theme in the following examples. The pawns are the most common tool in creating dynamic play: either playing for passed pawns or (first) attacking weak pawns in the opponent's camp. The pawn structure is thus of utmost importance in all these positions. The Swedish Grandmaster Tom Wedberg has pointed out that there is an advantage in having only one piece: your full force can move in only one move. If three pieces are badly coordinated, it can take several moves to rearrange them, but a single queen can't have bad coordination! I will return to this subject in the upcoming examples. Two minor pieces against a rook The player with a rook against two minor pieces often has one or two pawns as compensation. However, as pointed out by Silas Lund in his great book Rook vs. Two Minor Pieces, dynamic factors are much more important than the number of pawns. Ali mentioned in the previous section, the player with the rook needs to create dynamic play, often with the pawns. The player with the rook should also try to exchange pieces, for many different reasons: A It becomes easier to create passed pawns - the most common kind of dynamic play A There are more open files for the rook. A It becomes difficult for the minor pieces to defend all the entry squares, and also all the pawns. A Ali mentioned in the quote from Wedberg, the two pieces are slower to move. That is more important the fewer pieces there are on the board, since each piece must cover a bigger part of the board. In the following game there is one variation with a position that illustrates the kind of play that suits the rook.

A position with two minor pieces against a rook has arisen. The first thing to look for in such positions is whether the player with the two minor pieces has outposts. In this position, Black doesn't have any clear outposts and will not be able to coordinate his minor pieces against one target. The second thing to look for is whether the pawns can create dynamic play. They can - if White advances his queenside pawns, he will get two connected passed pawns. White is slightly better. His only risk is that he will weaken squares when he advances on the queenside, so he has to be careful. The game continuation keeps the material equal, but White gets a strong initiative.

Training position The exchanging operation seen in the previous moves can happen in various positions in the King's Indian. White gets two knights for a rook and two pawns. The position doesn't suit the rooks - there are no open files. At the same time, it doesn't suit the minor pieces either, since there are no outposts and no attack on the king. What Black needs to do is keep a dynamic pawn centre and advance with ...d5 and ...e5 without creating any weak squares. Ideally, he will manage to create passed pawns on both the c- and d-files. White, in contrast, wants to fix the centre by playing f2-f4 and e2-e4-e5. Ulf Andersson's intuition says that White is better, even though it might be difficult to play. However, when we analysed the position, we didn't reach a clear conclusion. I6.'1Wd4t?! The game move is very natural, centralizing the queen when Black can't answer with ...Rf6. However, stronger might be: 1 6.lt:Jf4!? White plans e2-e4 on the next move to control Black's d-pawn.

rook and pawn{s). The player with the minor pieces tries to create outposts, while the player with the rook tries to open files. He also wants to push his pawns, but has to be careful to avoid weakening squares. Queen against two rooks The queen's favourite activity is capturing undefended pawns. Due to its mobility, it creates double threats more easily than other pieces. The rooks are strong when attacking isolated pawns. For that reason, it's generally to the rooks' advantage if the minor pieces are exchanged. The minor pieces are otherwise natural defenders of the pawns. The pawn structure is an important issue: the player with the weakest pawns often has the worse position. Both the rooks and the queen have weak sides. The queen is the worst blockading piece and is therefore not good when fighting against a passed pawn. The rooks are, on the other hand, often quite helpless if they lack open files. That is why the combination of a queen and some pawns is a very strong attacking unit against a castled king - the rooks are not there to defend. The first example is illustrative since it shows both cases: a position which is superior for the rooks and a position where the queen has both a weak king and weak pawns to play against.

1-0 I think Black's ...g5 is a great example of how to handle a position where the opponent has a static advantage. It's necessary to do something before the opponent has got everything under control. Queen against three minor pieces I once listened to a seminar by Tiger Hillarp on the topic "Queen against two minor pieces". He enthusiastically showed positions where the pieces prevailed. With that in mind, a third minor piece seems to be a luxury! There is some truth behind that. Three minor pieces are usually better than the queen. One exception is when there are a lot of weak pawns that the queen can capture - that habit could be noticed already in the previous section. There are of course also other exceptions when there are enough dynamic resources to compensate, like an attack on the king, badly coordinated pieces or passed pawns. The general plan with the minor pieces is to attack weaknesses - their numerical advantage will make them impossible to defend. The king is the first weakness to consider, pawns the second. The following example seems very simple; something a Grandmaster can play in a blitz game or even when half-asleep. However, it's interesting since Houdini doesn't understand anything at all.

Queen against rook and piece This material imbalance is not similar to the previous examples; the queen is simply too strong. It is usually not enough for the side with the rook and piece to have an extra pawn. He must also have an imbalance that is clearly in his favour, like a weak king or a dangerous passed pawn. It is a different story when the rook and the piece have strong outposts, which is often the case in many fortress-like positions. In the following position, the initiative becomes too strong for the queen to handle. I'll start before the queen sacrifice, because another interesting material imbalance could have arisen.

There are many reasons why this exchange sacrifice is good: 1) The rooks only have two semi-open files, both without prospects 2) It is not possible to exchange queens 3) There are opposite-coloured bishops Black doesn't have a single pawn for the exchange, yet I still have a slight preference for the black position. 22. ¥Nh5 a5 23.g4 .le4 24.f3 g5 The only move.

Thoughts about the training positions
1. Queen against two rooks
[diagram]
There are many reasons why the queen enjoys this position more than the rooks: 1) There are no open files 2) There are many undefended pawns 3) If Black castles, White might follow up with a pawn storm on that wing I think White is better, and I don't feel that any moves are needed to back up that claim.
2. Axel Smith - Bronislav Vymazal
Ceslci Trebova 2008
[diagram]
This was one of those pleasant morning rounds which often end tournaments. My feeling is that anyone who doesn't complain about waking up early has a competitive advantage against the others. With two rooks against a queen, the pawn structure often decides the evaluation of the position. All White's pawns are defended, while Black has two isolated pawns. It's easy to conclude that White is better. It might be possible to start advancing the queenside pawns quite early, but I think a much easier plan is the following: 1) Retreat the rook from b8 to the second rank 2) Play one rook to the e-file 3) Double on the e-file 4) Take both e-pawns 5) Promote 6) Go and collect my prize at the closing ceremony The third step is the only which will pose some problems. Black can try to create counterplay with ...g5 and ...h4, but it will be far too slow. 52JH8 lYd3 53.gff2 e4 54J�d2 lYb3 55,gc2 White threatens gc3 with unavoidable doubling next move. ss ... lYa 56J�gfl lYe3 56 ...

3. Sebastian Nilsson 2010
[diagram]
This position appeared when my friend Sebastian Nilsson analysed one of his games in the 1 8th ICCF Olympiad. Black has two knights and four pawns for the queen. In addition, there are opposite coloured bishops on the board. The first time I saw this position, I thought Black was clearly better. He has no obvious weaknesses and White has no entry squares for the heavy pieces. Black's plan may be to start by putting minor pieces on e4 and d5 and then continue with the march of the queenside pawns. My reasoning was too static. It's difficult for Black to place his minor pieces on e4 and d5, and White has a lot of time to create dynamic play in the meantime. Hans Tikkanen noticed that Black even has a lot of problems developing the light-squared bishop at all. He evaluated the position as balanced. Today, I agree. White has some plans of his own. One is h3 and g4, to attack Black's king. Another is to move the queen and threaten i.xf6. If the knight jumps to e4, White can try the undermining g2-g4 with greater effect, or even l'!xe4 followed by l'!f7. Black has to watch out for all kinds of exchange sacrifices. A plausible continuation is:
1.Rg3 g£8!
Black is solid enough but still has problems improving his position. The a-pawn alone won't do the job. It's unclear. l ...lLl e4?! 2.Rc7 and White has some pressure against g7. l ...lLl d5?! 2.h4 is a bit annoying for Black. 1 00 Pump Up Your Rating

The situation didn't look good for my team, so I desperately needed to win. However, the best strategy in such situations is still to play the best moves! Of course, there is an exception if the best move leads to an immediate draw, but that is not the case here. I could have continued to play against the weak squares. A good start is 34.ttJh5! followed by ltlg3-f5. White can then open up with g4- g5 at a timely situation. It's unpleasant for Black.

I have three pawns, but where is my rusty screw, and my yellow balloon? We have a material imbalance that has not been covered before: White has three pawns against a knight. The pawns are split into three different pawn islands, so it's not easy to create a dangerous passed pawn. If Black manages to activate the knights, he might easily get strong play, so White must try to stop that. White's dream is to win the pawn on a5 but he can also try other plans. 38 .. .tt� d7 After 38 ... lLla6?! 39.f4!?

39.d5t forces Black's king back, but at the

lfz-lfz Epilogue This chapter has discussed piece exchanges and material imbalances. There are many possible reasons to exchange pieces, or to avoid doing so. Nine are mentioned in the summary of the first section. Sometimes pieces with unequal value are exchanged. In such positions, concrete factors will always play a big role, but the examples also outline several useful principles. However, don't forget about verbal overshadowing, the phenomenon that's mentioned in the introduction. Verbalizing too much is harmful for your understanding, and no proverb beats a good move. So get well acquainted with the principles outlined in this chapter - but use them with a grain of salt. Chapter 3 Auxiliary Questions The purpose ofthis chapter is to bind together the pawn levers and piece exchanges into a smooth list of auxiliary questions, which can be used in most middlegame positions. Well, that's far too simplified a way of playing chess, but I think it's a good idea to have the auxiliary questions in reserve, for when intuition doesn't define in which direction to steer your thoughts. I encountered the method of asking questions for the first time in a splendid book from 200 1 : Jesper Hall's Chess Trainingfor Budding Champions. The auxiliary questions I propose are simpler; rhere are only six of them. Chapter overview Why is it useful to have auxiliary questions? When you play, it's easy to miss the forest because of all the trees. There are so many threats to take care of and variations to calculate that there is no time left for the big strategical questions. Two of the heroes from the previous chapters, Nils Grandelius and Ulf Andersson, help each other in the chapter's first game to show why auxiliary questions are important. When should the questions be used? As "auxiliary" implies, they are used when your intuition isn't enough to find a satisfYing plan, and especially in critical positions. The second section will give some advice of how to identifY those positions during the game. It is recommended to use the questions during the opponent's thinking time, when there is less need to calculate variations. So what do they consist oft Mainly positional considerations. Some important positional themes have already been covered in the previous chapters: pawn levers, piece exchanges and material imbalances. This chapter adds other imbalances. How should the questions be used? They are presented in a list, but used only when encountering difficulties in grasping a position. Mterwards, it will hopefully be easier to find a good plan. 1 04 Pump Up Your Rating Is there something they should not be used for? Yes! The auxiliary questions are only there as an aid, and shouldn't compete with your intuition. The first thing to do is still simply look for good moves. But they are useful if you are encountering difficulties getting a handle on a position. Using Auxiliary Questions The first game illustrates why it's useful to use auxiliary questions. Nils Grandelius was Black and has annotated the game. 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 Vladimir Potkin - NUs Grandelius Bundesliga, Emsdetten 4th February 20 1 2 1 ...

With White's last move, 24.a4, his idea is clear: to play slowly and keep it all under control, whereas Black has very few chances to get active himself.

Not only is it blocked by the pawns on a4/b5 and e6, but it also blocks the d-file, thus stopping Black from getting an active rook. The solution to the position must be to improve the horrible bishop. 24 ... .Be8! Our mainline was as follows: 2SJ�acl .Bg6! 26 . .Ba2 �d4

In view of his active king, Black is at least OK. All this looks pretty easy, you might say? Well, to some extent I actually ag�ee. Finding the bishop manoeuvre is definitely not beyond my abilities or understanding of the game. If I had been given the position after 24.a4 as an exercise, I'm sure I would have solved it. However, that's not the point! The point is that this requires another way of thinking during games. To ask myself questions such as "Which is my worst-placed piece?" might sound trivial, but during a game there are always lines to calculate, pawns that are hanging and threats that have to be taken care o£ This is precisely the area where a player like Ulf Andersson excels, and therefore also an area where I can learn the most from him. (That is the end of Nils Grandelius's annotations.) Critical positions The Swedish Grandmaster Lars Karlsson once said: "It was in Russia that I learned to play chess." He was referring to some months when he travelled around in the Soviet Union. Nils Grandelius and I made our pilgrimage in December 2007, to the snowy city of Vladimir with temperatures at -20° C. During seven double rounds in ten days, Grandelius followed the advice of declining all draw offers, and lost to a lot of unknown Russian schoolboys in an 1M-tournament, while I did the same in a GM-tournament. To lose the following amazing game annoyed me at the time, but later I understood what went wrong. 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 Dmitry Lavrik -Axel Smith Elizaveta Bykova Memorial, Vladimir 1 9th December 2007

The move deserves only one exclamation mark this time. The zugzwang is now decisive. So what was the conclusion? When we returned from Russia, I still felt that I didn't know how to play chess. However, the situation became clearer when I analysed my games. While my opponents played normal moves in most positions and spent their time in the critical ones, I tried hard to find the very best continuation on every move. When we reached the important moments, I didn't have much time left. In the preceding example, it might not have gone wrong with some extra time on the clock. I drew the conclusion that I had to look for the critical positions and use a greater part of my time there. The strategy to use most time for the critical decisions is quite obvious and universal for all games, but how do you find the critical positions in chess? In Move First, Think Later, Willy Hendriks writes that the critical moments are easy to find with hindsight, but that there's no good prescription to find those moments during the game. A game doesn't contain five critical moves and thirty-five easy moves; it's rather on a continuous scale. That's true, of course, but it doesn't disqualify the guidelines for the characteristics of a critical position. It's even useful to find out that some positions are very critical and others somewhat critical. Chapter 3 - Auxiliary Questions 109 In the dictionary, the word "acute" is part of the explanation of "critical". It perfectly hits the mark. A critical position is one where an important decision can't be postponed - it must be taken immediately. In such positions, the next move creates or avoids creating a permanent change. I think critical positions can be divided into four categories. How to identify a critical position A Pawn structure All decisions regarding the pawn structure are critical, since pawns can't move backwards. It's never possible to take back a move with the pawn, and the change that's created is therefore permanent. A Piece exchanges or sacrifices It's the same reason: a captured piece will never return to the board. A Permanent decisions Quite often, it's possible to change your mind about where to play, not losing more than a tempo. Sometimes, it's not. Such permanent decisions are therefore critical. One example is the choice of whether to castle kingside or queenside. A Tactical positions Time is the most important factor in highly tactical positions. Every move will thus be critical, since the move risks losing the game at once. Moreover, the critical positions have two other features: they are important and it's diffi cult to find the best move. Both of those words are subjective, and you have to trust your own evaluation. But it will become clear that many decisions concerning the pawn structure or piece exchanges are not difficult at all, and others not so important. The list above is no recipe, only a shortcut to avoid playing a move without understanding that it's a critical moment. It would be too time-consuming to actively decide whether every single position is critical or not. I recommend, as in many other places in this book, to do so for a limited period. After a while, your intuition will be improved and you will often automatically spot which positions are critical. The following game is a good example of the importance of finding the critical moments.

Chapter 3 - Auxiliary Questions 1 1 1 IS.J.x£6? From a strategical point of view, White is 'forbidden' to exchange the dark-squared bishop without getting something in return. If he doesn't succeed with his attack, his remaining pieces will just be misplaced. The position is critical since a piece exchange is taking place. White should therefore take his time to search for a better move. 1 8.Be5! This fixes Black's kingside. Such moves along a diagonal are often difficult to find if it's also possible to exchange. The human player automatically rejects moving the bishop only part of the way, while still offering an exchange. We tend to see it in a 'binary' way - either exchange or avoid the exchange. 1 8. ..Bxe5 1 9.fxe5

0-1 There were four clearly critical positions for each player: moves 1 8, 24, 32 and 34 for White and 1 2, 1 5, 28 and 3 1 for Black. It would have helped both sides to understand when they appeared. Imbalances In Reassess Your Chess, Jeremy Silman writes that it's useful to talk about imbalances instead of advantages. This is well shown in one of the examples from the previous chapter (page 61), where White's space would be advantageous with the minor pieces on the board, bur was disadvantageous without them. Taking that into account, it's better to talk about more space than a space advantage. There are nine possible imbalances in chess, all with self-explanatory labels: king safety, material, development, central control, initiative, space, piece placement, control over key squares and pawn structure. Chapter 3 - Auxiliary Questions 1 1 3 Most often both White and Black have an advantage in one or more of those nine categories. Both players want to make their advantageous imbalance the most important feature in the position. If the pawn structure is better, it's logical to strive for an endgame, but with central control, it's better to keep as many pieces as possible. The fight between different imbalances is well illustrated in the following game. The players are married, and since their children came to watch early on, I expected a quick draw. Instead, they created a very interesting game.

19.fi.xg7, winning the rook. Instead, I would
say that White has a small material advantage with the pair of bishops. White also has space, control over the centre and slightly better development. The pawn structure is unbalanced with many possible targets: h4, f7 and even c7. I prefer White's structure on principle, since there are two possible pawn levers: h4-h5 and d4-d5. It's difficult to say who has the better piece placement; neither side has control over important key squares. It sounds good for White so far, but there are still two imbalances left: king safety and the initiative. The position of both kings seems shaky. The player who gets the initiative will probably have the safer king, because the opponent will need to use his or her pieces for defensive purposes. Black needs to base his play on one or both of those imbalances: king safety or the initiative. He should avoid an endgame, where the bishop pair might be strong, and also avoid slow positions where the space matters. Therefore, he should act immediately, while White's rook still has to defend h4 and her king is on cl . With a pawn storm on the queenside, Black will get the most use out of his knights. In a messy position it's also pleasant to be able, at any move, to castle in either direction. If White uses all her forces to attack on the kingside, Black might simply escape by castling long, and vice versa.

Shortly thereafter, White's king became weak - the most important imbalance. Positional chess without creativity No one can play with just one grand gameplan, followed from the start until the end of the game. Rather, the plan may change from move to move depending on the opponent's reactions, and there may be several candidate plans to switch between. As I see it, positional factors in chess are things Chapter 3 - Auxiliary Questions 1 1 5 such as pawn structure, weak squares and good and bad pieces. All of them have a few basic principles that are easy to follow. Nils Grandelius has said that playing positionally means playing without creativity. He argues that positional decisions don't get difficult until the principles are questioned. Often they should be, but in simple positions there is less need for that; simple moves for simple positions. Sometimes there is actually nothing wrong with making a move without having any plan at all! Occasionally it's best to improve a piece without really knowing what to do on the next move. But only if it's a good positional move. One example is a move from the game against Stefan Christensen, earlier in this chapter, with Black to move.
[diagram]
I played 19 ... i.f5 to prevent White's f4- f5. I also saw that my knight looks nice after 20 . .ix£5 lilxf5, but I didn't calculate further. However, my thoughts were enough to play the move; there is no need for a deeper plan. This kind of chess without creativity is also in line with the conclusion from the previous section, to make natural moves in most positions and concentrate our efforts on the critical ones. I have noticed that many students I've had, including myself, have played in too complicated a style. While trying to take everything into account, we have forgotten that development and piece placement are often the most important things. The first plan is to complete development. The Swedish IM Emil Hermansson has half seriously added that it isn't completed until you have created luft for the king. I honestly believe that the advice of playing simply can be enough for many players to improve significantly. At least if it's connected to playing faster. While positional chess is every positional factor separated, I see strategic chess as all factors interwoven. The pawn structure needs to suit the pieces, and the piece placement should be adapted to the imbalances. When the players have castled on opposite wings, it's still positional to avoid getting a weak pawn, but it's probably not a good strategy to spend a tempo on such a thing. It's fully possible to have a positionally bad position and yet strategically a good one. Here is one example from the German league, where I play for Greifswalder SV: If I wanted to catch the train and reach the night-ferry to Sweden, the game could only take 2Y2 hours. I started by violating as many positional rules as possible. Axel Smith - Stephan Giemsa Oberliga Nord Ost, Berlin l Oth April 20 1 1 l.c4 ttlf6 2.lilc3 d5 3.cx:d5 ttlxd5 4.g3 g6

White's position looks like a beginner's. Two minor pieces sit on their initial squares while the queen has already moved; the king 1 1 6 Pump Up Your Rating can't castle on either wing and the g-pawn is backward. Black, on the other hand, has developed, castled and occupied the centre. Positionally, Black is much better.
[diagram]
However, the white pieces are cooperating with each other. The rook on b 1 stops the c8- bishop from developing. The bishop on g2 stops .. .l:!b8 due to Axc6, and .JiJe7 due to hb7. The queen stops ... a6 followed by ...b5 due to Eixb5. All those pieces work together towards the same goal. The white king can't be attacked behind the central pawns, at least not for the moment. White is much worse positionally and he isn't really threatening anything. Despite that, I think his position is better, but it's an extremely risky strategy. One slight mistake and it will backfire. That was what happened to Nils Grandelius when he lost a short game with White to Benjamin Bok in Corus 20 10. That game reached the position after 1 1 ...e5 and Bok won a brilliancy prize after checkmating in 21 moves. After the game, the computer quickly found the key moves for White on moves 12 and 13. The strategy is incredible - even Magnus Carlsen couldn't believe that it worked. However, it does! Grandelius showed the idea when he took revenge by beating an unsuspecting Eltaj Safarli in the Olympiad later the same year.
13.g4!!
Since the bishop on c8 has to stay put, the pawn is untouchable. White plans either lLlg1- h3-f2 or d2-d3 followed by Ae3, lLlf3 and g4- g5. I can say that it's quite calming to reach this position after having analysed it thoroughly.

1-0 Without any doubt, 1 3.g4 is my favourite move. White's g-pawn and king both look bad, but cannot be attacked in an effective way. It brings an old saying to mind: ''A weakness is only a weakness if it can be attacked." Chapter 3 - Auxiliary Questions 1 1 7 The central theme When evaluating a position with many imbalances, it's important to try to find out which of them is most important: the central theme(s). This is often where strong players prevail over weaker ones, since experience and intuition give an intuitive answer. And if the answer comes intuitively, there's no need to use the concept of the central theme at all. Nevertheless, it's also possible to try to figure it out. It is impossible, and too theoretical, to order the imbalances from one to nine. Here is a rougher list: 1) King safety 2) Material 3) Development, initiative 4) Central control, space, piece placement, control over key squares and pawn structure However, even though king safety is the most important imbalance, a slightly safer king doesn't have any impact at all if the opponent has a huge lead in material. What you have to do is check the different imbalances, in order of importance, and ask yourself if it can be enough to win the game. If the answer is yes, there is a great chance that you have found the central theme. I will again illustrate with a position from the game against Stefan Christensen, with Black to move. White is trying to attack Black's king, and that attack is clearly a central theme. On the other hand, White's heavy pieces on the kingside will be clumsy if the attack stagnates. It may be enough to win; hence piece placement is another central theme. In the game (page 1 09), Black managed to neutralize White's attack.
[diagram]
Mter the tournament in Vladimir, appreciated the concept of critical positions. However, I have also heard that the secret of the Soviet Chess School can be captured by the phrase: "Ifyou need to do something, do it!' It is a truism, but useful if it's interpreted like this: look for the central theme and try to do whatever you can to make the impact of that imbalance as big as possible. If the opponent's pawn structure is clearly better, but you have some possibilities to create an attack on the king, you should not care much about the pawns but make all possible efforts to attack the king. Playing according to the central theme sometimes requires immediate, dynamic play, and other times slow, static play. Some of the imbalances are possible to categorize as either dynamic or static, like development, initiative and material, but most are not. To have a better king is usually a temporary advantage, but it was a permanent (static) advantage in the game Timmerman - Andersson from the first chapter. You have to use your reasoning ability when you decide which tempo to strive for. The take-home message is to lean back and ask what's most important. Many players play in too complicated a fashion and forget about simple things such as development and piece placement. 1 1 8 Pump Up Your Rating The Auxlliary Questions The list of six auxiliary questions below covers the topics of the first three chapters: pawn levers, piece exchanges and critical positions. It's especially useful to ask the questions when it's the opponent's move; with less need for concrete calculations, there is time to make the positional considerations. I know I am repeating myself, but once again: If a strong move appears intuitively, there is nothing wrong with playing it. To force you to use the auxiliary questions would be too time consuming and would also be mean to a good old friend: your intuition. But the questions are useful if you can't find a plan, or if you can't choose between several different moves. AB you will quickly find out, some questions suit certain kinds of position. 1) Is this a critical position? The position is critical when you have to take a decision that is difficult and can't be taken back, such as in the case of pawn levers, piece exchanges and tactics. 2) Are there any pawn levers? Pawn levers are often the foundation of a plan and decide on which squares to place the pieces. The question should be asked both for yourself and your opponent. 3) Which imbalances are there? Possible imbalances: king safety, material, development, initiative, central control, space, piece placement, control over key squares and pawn structure. Are there any clear weaknesses to attack, a weak pawn, a weak square or a weak king? 4) Which pieces do you want to exchange? Take both your own and your opponent's pieces into account. Which is the worst-placed piece? 5) What is most important? Which tempo should you strive for? Compare and evaluate the findings from Questions 1 to 3. What seems to be the central theme of the position? Is your plan to consolidate, take prophylactic measures against the opponent's plan, or should you play actively before the opponent has achieved coordination? The last strategy should be used if the imbalance(s) in your favour are of a temporary nature. 6) Which candidate moves should be considered? Which move feels intuitively positionally correct? Look for candidate moves and make a short blunder check in the end. In the List of Auxiliary Questions, the positional factors (Questions 2-4) form the strategy (Question 5), which is implemented with the help of universal game theory (Questions 1 and 6). Candidate moves will be thoroughly examined in the next chapter. However, there is some specific advice I can offer about positional candidate moves. It's not possible to prove it, but I think that the inner logic of chess makes positionally-intuitive moves work tactically more often than it looks at first sight. Hence, it's worth spending some extra time looking for supporting tactics. It's also a good idea to start by calculating this move, since it has the highest aims. If it works, there is no need to examine other moves carefully, which would save time. When you play a move, it's not important to know the evaluation of the upcoming position. You only need to know if it's better than the other candidate moves. The evaluations you make when you choose between plans and Chapter 3 - Auxiliary Questions 1 1 9 moves are therefore not absolute but only compared against each other. If a move is clearly best, you should play it no matter if it's winning or drawing. I think that if you have such an attitude, you will after some time get used to taking decisions when comparing moves. It will less and less often happen that you think that two different moves or plans are of equal value, but instead consider the continuation you choose to be the best. 3) s 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 1) s 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 Exercises So - Shirov, Malmo 20 1 1

White's easiest winning plan is to advance his king to b6. That may sound remarkable, but there is no defence for Black. The rook must stay on the seventh rank, the queen must defend h4 and the bishop does nothing. After the king march, White plays �b8 and �xb7.

Using the auxiliary questions: 1) White may try b4-b5 to create a passed pawn, or f4-f5 to attack Black's king. Black can try ...g5 to undermine White's pawn on e5. 2) The position is very unbalanced. In the short term, White's king seems safer, but Black's king might be able to hide on g7 later. White has a development advantage and more space, while Black has a small material advantage with the bishop pair. The general target seems to be Black's king. 3) White doesn't want to exchange pieces, since his extra space may become a disadvantage, but it would be great to get rid of the strong rook on c4. The rook on dl is the worst-placed piece in White's position. Black's wishes are, of course, the opposite. 4) White's advantageous imbalances are mainly of a temporary nature, so he should act immediately. 5) IfWhite decides to go for a pawn lever, the position is critical. 6) White has to do something with the rook on h3. 26J!xh4, 26J!dhl and 26J!b3 are candidate moves.

4. Slavko Cicak - Gregorz Gajewski
Rilton Cup, Stockholm 2nd January 20 1 2
[diagram]
Every piece needs to take more responsibility in the endgame, since there are fewer of them. The knight is therefore not a good endgame piece, since it moves slowly between the wings. The rook is, on the other hand, at its best in the endgame where there are a lot of open files and ranks. With that said, it's easy to understand that Black wants to exchange rooks in this position. It's also possible to formulate the argument Chapter 3 - Auxiliary Questions 1 25 in a more general way: with two pieces of the same type, the second is sometimes unable to reach its full potential. For that reason, it is often good to exchange what you have two of (with bishops the exception - though, as mentioned previously, a light-squared bishop and a dark-squared one do not really count as two pieces of the same type). It's easy to get blinded by material. In the last move before the time control, Black erred. 40 • • • gxh3? 4I..Bd5! Cicak stopped ... :B:£7 and closed the d-file.

White enjoys a clear plus due to the horrible light-squared bishop on c8. The plan is to gain more space on the queenside and open up the position at a suitable moment. Black is, on the other hand, desperately trying to achieve the pawn lever ...e5, freeing both bishops and undermining White's queenside structure. Since White's pawn on f4 does a great job

16.ltle5 would be a mistake due to 16. ..f6!
17.lLlxd7 hd7 and White has several reasons
to be dissatisfied. With less space, Black is generally happy to exchange pieces, but especially the knights since White's knight had more tasks. Both knights fought for the vital e5-square, but White's knight did in addition defend d4. Even worse for White is the loss of a tempo, since Black is ready for ...e5 while White has to defend the pawn on f4. 1 8.g3 e5 is a strategical failure, so White has to try 1 8.h5 Wfxf4 19.hxg6 f5 but with d4 hanging and ...e5 coming, Black is on top. When I saw this position I was halfway through writing this book and felt that I could just skip all the other examples. This one alone is a highway into the book's essence: thinking about pawn levers, weak squares and prophylactic measures. I showed the position at a seminar, and one of the listeners managed to play a similar h4-h5 lever only a few weeks later! The only problem with the example is that many of my students played 1 5.h4 to attack the king, which is not really the idea behind the move. So I had better include the rest of the material in this book anyway. Chapter 4 Calculation I remember once when I was very satisfied with a variation I calculated during a game. It was long and had a beautiful point at the end. The game went differently, but I showed the variation to my opponent in the post-mortem. He couldn't understand why I had spent so much time on it; after only three moves it was clear that something had gone wrong for him. He was absolutely right. Calculating well is not the same as calculating far. A player who chooses reasonable candidate moves, calculates them in a reasonable order and knows when to stop, will often find better moves even though he calculates much shorter lines. That is the subject in this chapter - the theoretical side of calculation. Chapter overview The chapter is divided into three sections. It starts with a tough introductory example - a very tactical position from a game of mine, where I spent a lot of time calculating. Later, I gave the same position to Hans Tikkanen as an exercise, to compare how we thought. It turned out that he was much more structured. The position will be used as an example when discussing various topics later in the chapter. For that reason, I suggest that you spend some time on it. The second section discusses structured calculation, with the following parts: 1 ) Just looking 2) Calculating the most forcing moves 3) Setting a goal 4) Candidate moves 5) Sorting the candidate moves 6) Calculating and visualizing 7) Comparing 8) Falsifying 9) Blunder checking Ideally, those tools only need to be carefully studied once. Even though it will always be possible to improve your skill in calculation, at least you will have a foundation.

At the same time, I am conscious that although this is a way that has worked well for me, it may not suit others. You should therefore feel free to pick what you like, and dismiss the rest. The normal reaction when seeing a list like the one above is: "That is not the way I calculate!" That's true, and you should not. This is a theoretical chapter, but the idea is that you study the tools, practise them thoroughly, incorporate them into your subconscious, and finally let intuition guide your calculations. If your calculations are running smoothly, it would just be stupid to disturb them. However, when intuition doesn't flow, it is useful to deliberately use some of the tools. The third and final section discusses visualization and the ability to calculate, again with a few sub-topics: 1) Visualizing 2) Working memory 3) The opponent's moves 4) Going forward in the variation 5) Focusing on a position 6) Ending the variation The second section can be seen as the railway track and the third section as the locomotive; both are needed to take the passenger to her destination. In this chapter there are also several concrete training tips, which may help to add more fuel to the engine. One exercise In the diagram position, it's White to play. Use up to 25 minutes to decide which move to play, trying to calculate as well as possible. Endnotes1 are on page 1 56.

On move 17 my opponent played a novelty. Judging by his time management, it wasn't a planned one. My following two moves were obvious captures, and then I reached the diagram position. It was time to calculate! I will reproduce the thought processes I had when encountering the position, and later the thought processes of GM Hans Tikkanen, when he was given it as a training position. I wrote down my thoughts after the game, while in the case ofTikkanen, I recorded him while he thought and spoke at the same time. Our calculations should definitely not be mistaken for a solution! When calculating, the moves are thought of in many different ways, but for simplicity, I have given them with standard annotation. Since the thoughts jump back and forth, it may be a good idea to use a board and pieces. Chapter 4 - Calculation 1 29 Axel Smith << My opening analysis ended in an advantage, and he didn't play the best 17th move. Since then, I have played two obvious moves and so I must have a good position. I am one pawn down, but can win it back with 20.bb5t. It seems natural for Black to exchange queens: 20 •• .

Black can't defend against the advance of the pawns on the queenside. I used double the amount of time compared to Tikkanen - 40 minutes. That was far too much, and somewhat deservedly, I later blundered in time trouble and lost. Tikkanen paused several times to look for candidate moves. While I saw 93 unique moves in 40 minutes, he saw 79 moves in 1 6 minutes - many more moves per minute. Generally, he calculates faster than me, but I became unnecessarily slow by checking the same moves many times. If we take the moves I calculated and put them in a variation tree, like Kotov mentioned in 1hink Like a Grandmaster, it looks like this. That doesn't look like my lines of thought! It's not possible to keep all the lines in your head, and much better to only compare the final positions and exclude the worse ones. a b c d e f g h / �2Jhe5 �fd8+ I

Chapter 4 - Calculation 1 39 Structured calculation There is no universal calculation model to follow through thick and thin. However, there are some tools that are useful to learn. As I wrote in the introduction, I believe that many thinking techniques can be internalized if you use them extensively for a period of time. That is the idea behind this chapter. It makes sense to make this presentation in some sort of chronological order, but it is not a strict one. Using everything would be cumbersome, so I think it's best to focus on one part at a time. With those many warnings issued, it's time to start sketching the process of calculation. !) Just looking You are probably already looking for interesting moves and ideas before it's your turn. When the opponent has moved, the first question is: Why did he play this move? If he threatens something, you normally have to defend, even though creating a counter-threat is a nice way of doing so. But if he doesn't threaten anything, you can continue to just look for a short time. Many years ago I had a friend who enthusiastically said that he had discovered the secret to playing well. He said that moves simply came to him when he looked at the board. I didn't give much for his insight, and rather saw it as a sign of his usual laziness, chatting as much as thinking. Many years later I appreciate what he said. Moves are automatically popping up when looking at the position. I have not yet met a chess player who has managed to stop moves popping into his head, and it only would be harmful if we did stop them. The importance of the initial thoughts should not be underestimated. In some way the moves that just 'pop up' are random, but at the same time they are probably some of the most forcing moves. They give a feeling for the position, what you should strive for, and probably hints about how much time needs to be spent. Only then is it time to start being a bit more structured. 2) Calculating the most forcing moves If you have a clearly forcing move, it's a good idea to simply start by calculating it. The move is usually the one that aims highest, and if it works, you don't need to calculate other moves as carefully. If it doesn't work, you've got less to keep in mind. Also, the most forcing move seldom takes much time to calculate. And while doing this, you might discover tactical possibilities that are useful to be aware of when you list the candidate moves. In the initial example, I started by calculating the discovered check 20.hb5t. That was good, but when I noticed that it took some time to finish the calculations, I should have paused to look for other candidate moves. 3) Setti ng a goal Before asking "how?" you must have the answer to "what?" - it's difficult to search without knowing what to look for. After having taken a quick look at the position, you often have a feeling of the approximate evaluation. Your intuitive goal is to get a position which is at least as good as that. However, sometimes it's necessary to actively set a goal. There are three different types of goals. a) The goal is based on an absolute evaluation When I encountered the position in the introductory example, I knew that my opening analysis ended in a slight advantage and that I had made two good moves since then.
140 Pump Up Your Rating
Hence my goal was to find an advantageous position. For me, this kind of reasoning is very common. By analysing the opening at home, I get a feeling for the evaluation, which becomes my goal during the game. However, the goal can also include practical factors, like getting a good position without risk. A computer or a perfectionist would not approve, but, as Vassilios Kotronias mentioned in Grandmaster Battle Manual perfectionism is something that only fits in an ideal world, a utopia. With the clock constantly ticking, the chess board is definitely not utopia. Occasionally, the position seems to be screaming for a tactical win, which sets the goal to "win". Other times, the goal has to be restricted to "survive", for example when the opponent has a tremendous attack. b) The goal is based on something to achieve Three examples are: taking control of an open file, castling before the opponent gives a check, or carrying out a pawn lever. c) The goal is based on a particular position Most often, the goal is only to reach a position that is better than another particular position. The following position is one example. 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 Michael Schulz -Axel Smith Oberliga Nord Ost (var), Berlin 2008

My goal was to keep the queen on b2 to disrupt White's development. 1 1 . ..O-O seemed to be a natural move, but I had to make sure that the queen doesn't get trapped. This kind of goal is relative.

WI'b6 was the best move. The first type of goal (based on an absolute evaluation) is used when you know or have a strong feeling of the evaluation of the position. One example can be found below, in the paragraph about "falsifying". The second type of goal (based on something to achieve) is used when there is something concrete to achieve at the board. Most often neither of these goals is possible, which leads to the relative goal. When Tikkanen started to calculate in the introductory example, he did not have anything to start from since he hadn't played the first 1 9 moves. He started by calculating 20.J.xb5t and evaluated it as slightly better. After that, his goal became to find a way to an even better position. This is a common method: to start by calculating a simple variation and then trying to find something better. The goal is important. If you set too ambitious a goal, for example to find a win from a worse position, you start to reject variation after variation. When there is none left, you still don't know which move to play, since you didn't check if any of them were decent. If you, on the other hand, set too moderate a goal, you are at risk of overlooking the best move. If intuition suggests there may be a better move, it's time to change the goal. In the introductory example, my goal was to find a way to an advantage. When I thought I had, with 20.hb5t, I changed to a relative goal: to find a way to a bigger advantage. 4) Candidate moves The following exercise may not be the toughest. Spend a maximum of ten minutes on it. 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 Smith lst April 2012

White has improvements along the way, e.g. 1 8.h4 f5 with compensation.

23.l"lfel t wins the queen with an ongoing
attack. The point of this exercise is to check how much time is spent calculating the complicated variations after 1 6.�xh7t before finding 1 6.c4!. It's time to discuss candidate moves. To a great extent, candidate moves come naturally, without conscious effort. However, in unfamiliar or messy positions, it's important to look for them. With this in mind, it's not so surprising that Tikkanen was careful to look for candidate moves in the introductory example - the position was completely new to him. Training tips: For a limited period of time, carefully look for candidate moves in every position in your games. In this way, you obtain a good habit that can be used later. You will also get a better feeling for in which kinds of position you deliberately need to look for candidate moves. 5) Sorting the candidate moves Sorting the candidate moves is, for many, the most difficult phase. Which one should be calculated first? Sometimes it's necessary to look for a little while at all of them, to be able to sort them properly. However, this should not take up a lot of time. When sorting the candidate moves, there are two rules of thumb: a) Start with the move that has the highest aims This is more or less the same as the principle to calculate the most forcing moves first: if it works, there is no need to spend time on the other moves. That said, when short on time, without the possibility to spend the desired amount of time, it's better to start with a move that probably works.

However, it was also possible to play 2 I ..!e6t El2f7 23.'Rc2! and Black collapses. After calculating 1 9. .!h3, there is no need to examine the other moves. In the introductory example, Tikkanen started to look for candidate moves. The first move he calculated was 20.hb5t, the most forcing move and the only one that may win on the spot. Clearly, it is a good principle to start with the move that has the highest aims. b) In a calm position, start with the most logical move On the American TV show 60 Minutes, Magnus Carlsen said that he almost always knows which move he will play after less than 10 seconds. Such intuition is not for mere mortals, but even we have quite a good feeling for which move is positionally correct. Actually, the most logical move works tactically surprisingly often, even when it doesn't look like it, as I suggested earlier. Our intuition, practised in every single game, has created a decent feeling for seeing the move the position calls for. Therefore, it's worth spending some extra effort on that move to look for supporting tactics. There is another reason for starting by calculating the positionally correct move. Psychological science has found that there is a human bias to choose the option examined first, even if the conclusion doesn't say that it is best! In theory, it should be possible to avoid such a bias, but I am not sure how it is in practice. 6) Calculating and visualizing After having sorted the candidate moves, it's time to calculate. The subject is covered in the next section. In every line you calculate, you reach a point when it's time to evaluate the position. As established above, you mainly need to check if the position fulfils the goal you have set. To do this, you probably have to compare it with another position. 7) Comparing Humans don't evaluate positions with decimal numbers, as engines do. We make verbal or even unspoken evaluations. However, during a game, you don't even need to do that! You only need to decide whether the position is good enough to comply with your goal. When I calculated 20Jhe5 in the introductory example, it didn't matter if I thought that I was slightly or clearly better. The only thing I needed to know was if I liked the resulting position better than the position that I concluded with after 20.i.xb5t. If the resulting position complies with the goal, you can either be satisfied and make the move, or raise the goal and continue to calculate. Intuition will probably hint if there is something better or not. In the following example, Black starts with some strong moves but has a difficult choice a few moves later. The two possible continuations are both good and difficult to choose between.

An extra pawn in a rook ending is no guarantee of a win, but in this position Black has four against two on the kingside. White can't defend if Black simply advances the pawns. I would guess that both 23 ... 'Rc5 and 23 ... l:l:xd5 are objectively winning. What you have to do is not evaluate both positions objectively, but instead compare the positions with each other. When you make such a comparison, you also take into account practical considerations. There is much less risk of a blunder in the rook endgame, so I would no doubt choose 23 ... l:l:xd5. A feeling for the final verdict often appears during the calculations. Sometimes, it's quite

clear that it won't fulfil the goal. Then it's better to leave the move for the moment, and continue with another. The ability to calculate far is very important, but so is the ability to avoid calculating far when it isn't required. 8) Falsifying After some time, you have a feeling for which move is best. Of course, this is not enough to play it, since it's nothing more than a hypothesis. Actually, you have not reached much further than Carlsen would after 1 0 seconds! It is time to try "proving" that the hypothesis is correct. This is done by falsifying other reasonable hypotheses. "Isn't that move better?" "Is the chosen move really working?" The calculations become a bit deeper, by continuing where they stopped earlier and trying unlikely possibilities. Between 1 938 and 1 946, Adriaan de Groot made experimental studies of chess players' thought processes. In Thought and choice in chess (1 948), he stated that the main difference between weak and strong players was that the latter used a lot of the time, on average 50%, trying to prove that their chosen move was best. As you could see in the transcription of Hans Tikkanen's thoughts from the beginning of the chapter, he went backwards in his lines and asked: "Does Black have other moves?" That is a way of trying to falsify his conclusion. To falsify is not the same thing as using the Process of Elimination. That method works extremely well when solving exercises, since there is always a solution. In a game, it's different. If the goal is "to find a winning move" and all but one move has been excluded, it's very foolhardy to play the remaining move. The move might win, but the chance that the goal was too ambitious is not negligible either! The move might actually lose, while other moves draw. It's better to set a less ambitious goal and continue calculating. Thus, solving too many exercises can actually have a bad impact on your game. The solution is, of course, to shut your eyes to the hint that there is a solution to the exercise. Try to think of the position as if it is from a game. During games, the Process of Elimination is mainly used when defending. However, it can't be used alone. Moves that don't fulfil the goal are eliminated, but the last move standing must also be checked. The following game exemplifies the process of falsifying, and is also a good illustration of how to set a goal. 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 Axel Smith - Martin Bmedigan Czech Open, Pardubice 26th July 20 1 1

Therefore, it's a reasonable goal for Black to reach a position with an extra pawn. I don't know what lines my opponent calculated, but I have taken the liberty of writing down a plausible thought process for Black: Chapter 4 - Calculation 1 47 "28 ...hg3 29.hxg3 YMxd4t 30.i>h2 YMxa4 31J�cl!

I'll go for 28 ... .L:g3." And this is what Black played in the game - he should have drawn, but a later slip cost him. Black started by quickly calculating one line. Mter that, he set a reasonable goal to get a position with an extra pawn, and a hypothesis that 28 ...Rxd4t was the move to play. He started to falsifY the hypothesis and realized that it didn't work. He eliminated 28 ...Rxd4t but didn't find any other lines that gave an extra pawn. After that he had to set a new goal - to reach an equal position. He also needed to check the variations again, since he had not looked for equality in the lines he had calculated. The subconscious intuition easily excludes positions without really asking our conscious mind! A position with a doubled pawn may be rejected, but without considering whether the doubled pawn really is a weakness. In such situations, the intuition much be questioned by asking: Should I really avoid this move due to the doubled pawn? Intuition is a strong ally, but at times you have to confer with it! 9) Blunder checking In the introductory example, Tikkanen finished with a blunder check. There are few greater feelings of relief than when the blunder check discovers a huge blunder, and you get a chance to choose another move. A blunder check consists of the simple questions: a) What did my opponent threaten with his last move? b) What function does my piece have now, and consequently will give up when it moves? c) Does my opponent have any simple tactics? The first question is usually answered immediately when the opponent makes his move, but sometimes deep calculation may blind us to simple things. Generally, it's too time consuming to calculate variations twice. Blunder checks do that, in some sense. Hence it's better to make small blunder checks in the beginning of every tactical variation. It saves time by eliminating blunders before the whole line is calculated. Training tips: For a limited period, be very careful by doing a blunder check before you execute a move. In this way, you obtain a good habit that can be used later. You also get a better feeling for in which kinds of position you need to do a blunder check.

YNc8! Simensen found a double threat, winning a pawn. At the start, 1 3.Be3 was better. Summary The theoretical way to calculate is as follows: After having looked for interesting moves and ideas, you quickly calculate the most forcing moves. In that way, you get acquainted with the position and sees if there is an immediate win. However, before you start calculating seriously, you need a goal. What are you searching for? The goal is often based on a comparison with a particular position - you want to find a move that leads to a better position. After having set the goal, you look for candidate moves and sort them. The move that aims highest should be listed first - it's the move to start calculating. From each line, you get a position and check if it fulfils your goal. The evaluation of the position doesn't have to be absolute, you only have to compare it with the other positions you can reach. When you have made a preliminary decision in favour of a move, it's time to falsify it. Isn't there really anything that can be better? Lastly, it's time to make a blunder check before you execute the move. As mentioned above, you will not always use this method in practice, but it's useful to work with all of these parts, to use them subconsciously and take them out when you need. VISualization 1) Visualizing The most difficult part of calculation is to visualize the position, especially many moves ahead. To be able to do this, the position must be kept in your head. However, many players complain that they can't see the complete board in their head. I would say that it would be remarkable if they could! I can't even manage to focus on all the squares at the same time when I look at a real board. So why should it be possible without the board? The size of the part that can be seen in your head can't be measured in centimetres or squares. It's not only a geometrical figure that is visualized, but also a concept, whose size is 1 50 Pump Up Your Rating better measured in units. The pawn structure around the king may be one unit, for example. The pieces that aren't actually seen in your head are stored in your memory. For the same reason, it's very difficult to play Fischer Random blindfold. In such games, the pieces are arranged in a way you don't recognize, and thus you have problems merging them into larger units. Since the board in your head isn't graphical, different players see it in different ways. For some, it's vague, for some two dimensional and for others three dimensional. I do not doubt that some creative players even have a four dimensional board in their heads! We humans are able to visualize a mental map in our head, which we can use to recreate where we have walked. Nils Grandelius has jokingly said that he replaced his map with a mental chessboard. He lost his sense of direction, but became able to calculate far ahead! Well, even if the substitution never happened, the point is that strong players have developed a complete mental overview of an empty board. They know every square's colour and coordinates, and thus find it easier to see the range of the pieces, such as bishop's diagonals. This clearly facilitates calculation. Many strong players think "Knight c5" and suddenly see the knight on c5. Thus, the piece doesn't move, but just appears on the new square. Even strong players can, on the other hand, mix up the coordinates by involuntarily turning the board upside down. The h3-square is replaced with the a6-square, and so on. This actually doesn't harm calculation, since the squares keep the same colours and relative position. The analogy of the coordinates system as a foreign language is also quite good. Without being able to speak the language, all arguments must be translated before they can be presented. The coordinates system gives chess players a common language needed both to visualize and to discuss with other players. Training tips: There are a lot of exercises that can improve your mental board and help with learning the coordinates system by heart. a) Play on a board without coordinates and analyse by saying the squares instead of pointing at the board. b) Read from a list of random squares and say the colour of the square. c) The previous exercise reversed: point at a square and say the coordinates. 2) Working memory Working memory is an important part of visualization - memorizing the placement of the pieces. Psychological experiments have shown that it's only possible to keep about seven things there, with an individual difference of plus or minus two. But the chessboard consists of 32 pieces and 64 squares. Fortunately, the pieces are not stored one by one, but in larger units or chunks. The more experience a player has, the larger units he builds. Pawns on h7, g6, f7, a king on g7 and a rook on f8 is a well-known structure, which is stored as a single unit. An enemy bishop on b2 might also be included, if it checks the king. Other parts of the memory When calculating, much of the capacity is busy with thinking and making abstract assessments. If the working memory can't handle all the pieces that move in the calculated variation, they have to be transferred to other parts of the memory. That happens automatically, which explains why many players in the post- Chapter 4 - Calculation 1 5 1 mortem can repeat most of the variations they calculated during the game. But the working memory works more quickly and smoothly. When I played a 1 5-board blindfold simul, it consequently took some time to retrieve the position every time I switched between the games. I am not sure if the correct terminology is the intermediate-term memory (ITM) or the episodic part of long-term memory (LTM), but that's not important. To remember where the pieces are placed is, on the other hand, important. You don't need to actively memorize their squares, only be able to look for them when they are needed. For example, if you want to play ... i>h7, but are afraid of a check on the b1 -h7 diagonal, you look for White's light-squared bishop and queen, to see whether they can give such a check. Another example is when Tikkanen calculated in the introductory example. He asked himself: "Is the knight caught?" Then he looked around and answered: "No, the rook is still there and stops 26 . .. i>d7." Emotions facilitate the storing of memories. For me, chess games are very personal and filled with emotions, which may be why I remembered almost all the lines I calculated in the introductory example when I saw the position again, two years later. It's also about experience. Other parts of my memory are less practised. I am writing this in Hamar in southern Norway, and I can't for the moment recall the colours of the walls in the apartment where I have lived for the last year. When I came home from an apartment we considered buying, I was asked if there was a window in the kitchen and if there was a dishwasher. I couldn't answer either question! What I should have done was not to remember the dishwasher as an object but, of course, to remember its function - to replace me in doing the dishes. Focus The working memory's most important component is The Central Executive (Baddley & Hitch, 1 974). It focuses the attention on the task that should be performed, and nothing else. Psychological experiments have shown that the ability to block other visual and auditory information correlates very strongly with the results at many cognitive tasks. This does, of course, include chess. Focus is thus a key to being able to calculate well. The working memory is not only used to memorize the position of the pieces while calculating, but also when you compare positions, or when you reuse tactical motifs you have seen. To train the working memory is thus really helpful for your skill in calculation. Many people complain about their memory and blame increasing age. No doubt, this is part of the explanation but I think that attitude and training are even more important. Everyone can practise their memory! Training tips: Memorize the positions when solving exercises. Look at the diagram, try to remember, put it away and set up the position on the board. Doing this also helps the ability to group the pieces into units, which is important for visualization. There are also many other ways to practise your memory. For example, going to the supermarket without a shopping list, or refraining from writing down reference numbers and phone numbers. 3) The opponent's moves If the opponent has several moves, which is the best one to start calculating? Use the same principle as for your own candidate moves! Start with the most forcing or most ambitious 1 52 Pump Up Your Rating move. If it works, it can refute the whole idea, making it meaningless to calculate the opponent's other moves. However, if you are quite sure that none of his moves will fully satisfy him, you can start with the weakest moves. They can quickly be refuted and put aside, improving the order in your head. In the introductory example, after 20J:!:xe5 .le6 21.tLld4, Tikkanen started by calculating 21. •• .Be6, since his intuition suggested that move was best. He calculated Black's other moves only at the end. 4) Going forward in the variation When you make a move in your calculated variation, I think it makes a lot of sense to think of it verbally: "Bishop e6", "Knight d4". Since only a part of the board is seen in your head at a time, the rest of the pieces are kept in working memory. That doesn't only consist of The Central Executive, but also The Visuospatial Sketchpad and The Phonological Loop (Baddley & Hitch). The capacity of each of them is limited, so it's easier to remember if both are used - so you 'see' the move and hear it in your head. Personally, the second time I make the same move, I often replace the coordinates by thinking "take" or "check" or "there", depending on which type of move it is. Sometimes, when a move isn't working, you need to go backwards in the variation. If it's only one move, it's possible to do it in your head. Otherwise, my experience is that it's best to start from the beginning. To take back several moves risks messing things up, while it doesn't take many extra seconds to plough through the whole variation. In the introductory example, Tikkanen also started from the beginning when he needed to go back some moves. There are also a few other habits that make it easier to calculate. As mentioned in the paragraph about visualizing, the position isn't stored in working memory as a meaningless piece of information, but from the function of the pieces. After each move, it's therefore important to look for the new function of the piece: which squares does it control? This is especially important to do with forced moves. For voluntary moves, the function is seen more or less automatically - if there is a reason behind the move! One common mistake is to 'move' pieces which have previously been captured. In some way it's possible to say that they have moved involuntarily - off the board! Again, the same trick can be used, to think about which squares they don't control anymore. So, constantly updating the pieces' function is the key. It makes it much easier to keep the correct position in your head, when looking at another part of the board for a moment. I also think that it's good to update the material balance after each move. Often, chess is no harder than taking more pieces than your opponent! Young players learn to count the pieces on the board, not the ones off the board, since some of them may be in the opponent's hands. When calculating, it's on the other hand much easier to count the pieces that are captured. A possible line of thought from one of the lines in the introductory example is "pawn down, equal material, piece up, exchange down, piece up". In pawn endings, some books recommend counting the tempos. My experience is that much can be overlooked along the way with such a method. It's much safer to execute every move in the variation in your head. The most common question asked of chess players is: "How many moves ahead can you Chapter 4 - Calculation 1 53 calculate?" No question is more irrelevant - it does not get more difficult with the number of moves, but with the number of moved pieces. Besides, it's seldom necessary to calculate more than a few moves ahead. The introductory example is one of the positions I have spent most time calculating during a game. Even there, the main point (23 . .!f5) is no more than seven half moves ahead. 5) Focusing on a position In Improve Your Chess Now, Jonathan Tisdall recommends a method called the Stepping Stone Method. The method is to pause at a critical position in a calculated line. During the pause, you look at piece after piece to get a clear view of the position. However, most often only a few pieces move in a calculated variation, which makes it easier to look at the board. Most pieces stay on their initial squares! Only a few players, such as Alexei Shirov and Vassily Ivanchuk, have the amazing habit of looking out of the window or up at the ceiling, but not even they do it regularly. In long and complicated variations, I also find it too time consuming to use the Stepping Stone Method. It may be a matter of taste, but for me it's better to be careful every time a piece moves. Nevertheless, even if it was possible to calculate the variation, it may be difficult to assess the resulting position. A weak square is much easier to see on a real board than on a mental board. That is because the position doesn't automatically show up; you need to 'ask for' the pieces and squares to see them. If you know what to look for, like a weak square, it's no longer difficult to see if there are any. Often, the preceding moves point out the important positional factors. In the following exercise, it's necessary to calculate many moves ahead. Bo Lindberg 2006

Calculate to the end, and don't forget to update the function of the pieces when they move or get captured. If you need a hint, then see below. HINT: White has a forced checkmate. If you are close to finding the solution, start by sacrificing the queen and don't forget that 3 ...gxf5 blocks the f-file! Black is three pawns up and has a huge attack against f2 or gl . At the same time he has few defending pieces, so White's best chance seems to be to go for a direct attack. After l . .!xf7t �xf7 2.�b8t 'it?g7 3.llJf5t �xf5 there is no follow-up. I.VNxf7t!! The following variation is actually not so difficult: Black has in most cases only one legal move and White has seldom more than one check. The challenge is therefore to see the position at the end of the variation. l. .. �xf7 2J�b8t �g7 3.c!tlf5t gxf5 3 ... �xf5 4.�g8# 4J!:g3t �h6 5J:!:b6t
5.�h3t is a draw. In a game, White therefore
1 54 Pump Up Your Rating would not need to see any further than this, since there are no other possible moves in the starting position. 5 . • • tLle6 5 ...�h5 6.Bxf7t leads to mate on the next move.

7J�h3t 'kt>g5 7 ... 'it>g4 8J�h4t 'it>g5 9.lLlf3#
8.tLlf3t 'kt>f4 9.gh4#
I think the most difficult part of this exercise is to see that there is a black pawn on f5, which takes away a square from the king. When Black played 3 ...gxf5, it's easy to think that the pawn doesn't mean anything. It may therefore fall out of our memory. I think it's easier to remember the pawn's existence if it's noticed that the pawn blocks the f-file for the rook on f7. That's also important to prevent Black from capturing the knight on f3. Black can sacrifice the bishop on c8 on the second move, which means that the exercise is mate in 1 0 moves. 6) Ending the variation When the goal is fulfilled, it's time to stop the calculations. However, to know if the goal is fulfilled requires an evaluation of the position. It is difficult to evaluate a position when there are still tactical possibilities. Therefore, if possible, it's better to continue the calculations as long as there are tactics. The first chess computers were very bad in this regard; they could stop their calculations in the middle of a queen exchange! As in so many cases, it requires good intuition to understand when the position is tactical, but there are also a few general principles. There are some signs for tactical possibilities: immediate threats, uncoordinated or undefended pieces. The threats don't have to be capturing a piece, but can also be taking control over an open file or something similar. The relevant question is: If you or your opponent gets an extra move, could either of you do something dangerous? If not, it's usually safe to conclude that the position isn't tactical any longer. In positions without tactical possibilities, it's less important and also much more difficult to calculate, since the variation tree increases much faster without forced moves. Once I received some advice to end all calculated variations with a move of my opponent. In that way, I would avoid overlooking tactical combinations. I think it was very bad advice. When considering a move of your own, you only have to calculate one move, but when considering a move of the opponent, you usually have to calculate 2-4 different moves. The variation tree thus increases much more with a move of the opponent. Hence, it's better to end the variations with a move of your own and only make a short blunder check. In the introductory example, it's necessary to see 23.Bf5 before planning the exchange Chapter 4 - Calculation 1 55 sacrifice. After 20 ... i.xb3, there is no need to see any further before evaluating the position, and I would even say that it would be a mistake! Since Black doesn't have any tactical possibilities, it's possible to conclude that 20.l"i:xe5 is better than 20.i.xb5t, without seeing the tactical solution 20 ... i.xb3 2 l .axb3 �f8 22.i.xb5!.To save time, it's important to not calculate too far. Summary I believe all the tools that you have examined in this chapter make it easier to calculate well. To continue with the analogy from the beginning of the chapter where the tools built up the railway track and calculation and visualization was the locomotive: A straighter and well structured railway track not only makes the distance shorter, but also allows a stronger locomotive. With structured calculation, you no longer operate with steam locomotives, but with a high-speed train. Below is a sketched instruction manual for the railway to calculation. 1) Just looking Simply by looking at the position, moves pop up in your head. In that way, you get acquainted with the position, notice tactical motifs and get a hint on how much you have to calculate. 2) Calculating the most forcing moves The reason to quickly calculate the most forcing moves is mainly to get rid of them. If they work, you don't have to calculate other moves. If they don't work, you can forget about them. However, only a small amount of time should be spent with these calculations. 3) Setting a goal The goal is seldom to find a winning or drawing move, but only to reach a better position than your goal. In the example Schulz - Smith, you knew that the retreat l l ...Wi'b6 was possible, and thus set the goal to find something better. 4) Candidate moves Candidate moves often come naturally, but in an unfamiliar position you need to consciously look for them. 5) Sorting the candidate moves The move that aims highest, tactically or positionally, should be calculated first. The reason is the second topic above: if it works, you don't need to spend so much time on the other candidate moves. 6) Calculation and visualization When you calculate, you only visualize a part of the position at a time, exactly like when you look at a visible board. The remaining pieces are kept in the working memory. There are some tips that make it easier to remember: a) Stay focused! b) Say the moves in your head when you calculate - this activates other parts of the memory c) Think of the function of the pieces whenever they move to a new square d) Keep track of the material balance when something is captured You also use your working memory to remember the candidate moves, different lines and evaluations. An effective working memory is thus by far the most important quality you need to calculate well. Ideally, you want to calculate as long as 1 56 Pump Up Your Rating there are tactical possibilities and evaluate the position when it's of a positional nature, but that's difficult since chess is so full of tactics. A good rule of thumb, though, is to stop calculating when one of the players has many moves which seem to be of about the same strength. 7) Comparing From each line, you get a position and check if it fulfils your goal. The evaluation of the position doesn't have to be absolute, you only have to compare it with the other positions you can reach. 8) Falsifying The Process of Elimination can be used extensively when solving exercises, but seldom in a game. When you have decided in favour of a move you should try to falsify it. This means that you try to check if the move really is the best. According to Adrian De Groot, strong players use on average 50% of their time after they have preliminarily decided on a move! 9) Blunder check The last thing to do is a short blunder check, to avoid making big tactical oversights. This is a theoretical model. In a real game, there is neither time nor any need to go through all the steps. Instead, the different tools should be studied and practised, and then picked up when you think you need them. In the chapter, there were also a lot of training tips. Here are the most important: Habits during games: For a limited period of time, be careful to look for candidate moves in every position in your games. Do the same for blunder checking. Visualization: Use a board without coordinates when analysing and playing. Working memory: One way of practising your working memory is to memorize the positions when setting up exercises. However, working memory can also be practised in many ways in everyday life. Endnotes

PART II
A TRAINING PROGRAM
1 58 Pump Up Your Rating The first part of this book was about 'thinking chess' and examined methods that only have to be studied once. Well, only once at least in theory. In practice, you will notice that even if you look carefully for candidate moves in one tournament, it's possible to forget about them in the next. The focus of the second part of this book is on everyday training; what you need to do continuously to improve. First things first - you have to enjoy your chess training. I have always enjoyed every part of chess, and thus have never needed to worry about my motivation. However, the Swedish chess instructor Robert Danielsson has formulated four golden principles for all chess training, based on the acronym MONA: Motivation, Variation, Level Adaptation and Active Learning. (Yes, I know that doesn't spell MONA - the acronym comes from the Swedish language). A varied and level-adapted program motivates, since the training becomes more enjoyable. We are all different, and it's impossible that the same methods will suit everyone. Hence, I encourage you to pick what you enjoy from the following four chapters. The first step is to look for a training partner. It is not only necessary when analysing games you have played and important when analysing openings, but it also broadens the way you think. Furthermore, two players tend to inspire and push each other in the right direction. Your ambitions and opportunities to spend time on chess will vary over time. The following chapters are written for everyone, from the player who "only" wants to pump up his rating a little bit, to the player who will do everything she can to become as strong as possible. In some ways, both players can do the same things, only with different intensity. While the first player solves tactical exercises for fifteen minutes, four days a week, the second may do so for two hours a day. Nevertheless, there are some training methods that should be given priority. Mummies In Lund we have an expression for a player who never improves: a mummy. It is not said in a negative sense; the mummy enjoys chess. The romanticizing of the expression has even gone so far that The Mummy (SK Mumien) is the name of a chess club! Many mummies actually see themselves as quite ambitious players. This could be a typical chess diary of a mummy: Monday: Playing blitz for two hours on the internet. Tuesday: Watching live games from a super-tournament for the whole evening, while checking the games with an engine. Wednesday: Warming up with some blitz games, before watching a DVD. Thursday: Planning to prepare for the weekend's game by reading a chess book, but running out of time after reading chess news on the internet. Friday: Reading a book about great players from the past. Looking at the diagrams, but concentrating mostly on the great stories in the text. The book is read in bed, thirty minutes before falling asleep. Saturday: Losing a tight game in the league, and afterwards claiming that a single mistake decided the game. Checking the game quickly with an engine. Sunday: No chess; impossible to be motivated after such an unfair loss! A Training Program 1 59 Our mummy spends a lot of time on chess, but he won't improve much. Many of his training methods do not follow the fourth capital from MONA: Active Learning. The key to learning a foreign language is to try to speak it. Without any doubt, it's also good to listen, but it's when sentences are first formulated that improvement really starts. It is the same in chess, and active learning is my hobbyhorse as a coach. This means questioning statements in books (maybe I should have mentioned that earlier!), forming your own opinions, and using training methods that activate your brain. With only some small changes, our mummy can come alive! Limit the number of blitz games to a maximum of five per day Blitz can be a good form of training if you are fully concentrated, but it is often played just as a routine. In addition, in internet blitz a lot of time is wasted, not only waiting to start games, but also playing uninteresting positions, for example when it's high time for one of the players to resign. I also recommend using some minutes after each blitz game to check the openings and think if there is something that you don't understand. Watching live games without an analysis engine An engine often has the effect of putting your brain into hibernation. It's better to predict the players' next moves on your own. (By the way, I have never understood why it's so interesting to follow things live, often just waiting for the outcome, but then I have never owned a Tv.) Watching DVDs with exercises Sadly, my brain can't reach the same level of effort when I passively take in information, as when I have a task to solve or a question to answer. That's why this book contains exercises in every chapter. In addition, the speed in DVDs are for the average viewer, and that can't be effective for everyone. Accepting mistakes Our mummy player doesn't seem to have good self-knowledge, since he persuades himself that he lost the game only due to one mistake. To be open and accept all our mistakes is a very important characteristic for an ambitious chess player! Focusing on the chess I don't consider historic knowledge to be important. However, I know there are other schools of thought, and I have even heard one of the most acknowledged FIDE trainers say that it's impossible to become strong in chess without knowing the World Champions in chronological order!

When I played against Lajos Portisch in Sigeman & Co in 2008, I knew only a few of his games - the games from the first rounds of the tournament. Furthermore, I don't think I have ever seen a complete game by Bobby Fischer. Of course, I would be happy to know more, but my point should be clear enough: the moves are important, not the names. My advice to our mummy player would therefore be to read everything in the chess books and magazines, not only the gossip. Of course, I don't argue against reading chess news, but I see it more as entertainment and inspiration rather than serious training. Being fresh when practising chess You should strive for quality in your chess training. If you happen to be tired when it's time to study chess, or dead as in the case of the mummy, I think it's better to postpone the session. That was a lot of advice, but none of it should be that hard to follow. I also think it's a good idea to structure the time you spend on chess, at least a little bit. If a few hours are set aside for chess, wirh your mobile phone off and the internet unplugged, it's much easier to stay focused. Not only because the surroundings are less distracting, but also because you have a clear purpose. The same advice can be used for other areas. When I became disappointed with my focus while writing this book, I threw away my mobile phone, and forbade myself to check news on the internet. Almost a year later, it's still impossible to call me, but the book is finished. Club: K.ristiansund SK Born: 1 999

A Training Program Tari learned to play chess when he was five, while watching his older brother playing with his father. He finished 5th at the World Youth Championship in 2010 and 4th in 2011. In 2012 I started coaching him. In the Norwegian Open Championship in 2013, Tari made his first GM norm, aged just 13. A Training Program 1 6 1 When I started coaching Aryan Tari in 201 2, one of his main questions was what he should do during his everyday training. He was already doing the most important thing - playing tournament games against strong opponents. Tari played over 200 games per year, but at home his training was not so structured. I think there are five important training methods. Four of them will have a chapter of their own. The List of Mistakes - how to analyse your games Your games are the secret to finding your weak points and tell you what you need to improve. For that reason, the most important training method is to analyse your games - without the help of a computer. Aryan Tari started to annotate his games extensively, and we also created a "List of Mistakes" for him. In such a list, every mistake is documented and categorized. I think many common mistakes can be avoided in future simply by noticing them; if you learn that you often overvalue passed pawns, you will be careful before doing the same thing in the next game. Tari noticed that he allowed many combinations, even though he seldom overlooked combinations of his own. In the next tournament, he deliberately spent more time looking for his opponent's combinations. The Woodpecker Method Probably most of your games are decided by tactics. At least that's the case for me. Yet only a limited number of players solve tactical exercises regularly. I think the reason is that it doesn't feel as rewarding as other forms of training, since it's not possible to verbalize what has been learned! That's unfortunately a very human characteristic. In this chapter, I will explain what the tactical model Hans Tikkanen did when he went through a carefully planned training program in the spring of 20 10. He started by examining all the tactical motifs carefully, to learn them by heart. When he was satisfied, he started to solve relatively simple tactical exercises from a tactics book. When he had finished the book, he started all over again. Tikkanen's idea was that repeating the same exercises was the key to improving his tactical skill. His results confirmed his theory: in the following summer, he made three GM norms in seven weeks, improved 1 00 Elo points and became a Grandmaster. The first part of the chapter discusses how to solve exercises; it should be as similar to a game as possible. The tactical motifs are presented in the second section. I recommend that everyone follows The Woodpecker's Method, but it can be done with very different levels of ambition. Aryan Tari spent a lot of time with a Tactics Trainer on the web. The main advantage with that is all of the time is spent thinking, while under time pressure. There is no need to set up the pieces and no time to think about other things. Practising chess is almost always a pleasant activity, but sometimes it's tough to motivate ourselves to give maximum effort. Then it's very easy to start playing blitz ... To enjoy it is always important, but my experience is that humans have a clever psychological mechanism: if you put all of your efforts into something, you will begin to appreciate it after only a few days. It is therefore worthwhile to continue solving exercises for a second day even if the first felt 1 62 Pump Up Your Rating tough. If you believe in what you do, the results will surely come. The player who complains about his poor memory doesn't really try to remember, and thus he confirms his complaints. The same stigmatizing effect involves age. Age doesn't make it impossible to improve in chess. It may make it a bit more difficult, but that's just a challenge! Openings Some players don't like to study openings. Great - there are a lot of other things to do! Others spend all of their chess time on openings. That's too much, but I think that studying openings can be a useful training method, if done in the right way. The key is once again to have an active approach and question statements in the opening books. The same can be said when analysing the engine is necessary but should never replace human evaluations. I really believe in creating "opening files" where the openings are explained in your own words. It makes it much easier to analyse the lines, find novelties and keep the repertoire in order. Nils Grandelius, the chapter's model player, works according to this structure and achieves excellent results in the opening. Nevertheless, openings should mainly be studied only when you think you have spent enough time on the two linchpins: analysing your games and solving exercises. To create opening files requires structured work and makes it less suitable for younger players. Aryan Tari was 1 2 years old when I started coaching him, and in the beginning he received finished opening files from me. However, he soon was given the task of creating a file on his own. The day after he scored his first GM norm, he told me that he had started to work on openings with another chess player from Oslo. That made me almost as happy as the norm; it's hard to overstate the importance of a training partner. Endgames The best way to practise endgames is to decline draw offers, play long games and analyse the endgames afterwards. In this chapter, the subject is only theoretical endings. There are between a dozen and a hundred endgames that are, depending on your level of ambition, useful to know by heart. A motivating method to study the endgames is to challenge a friend to a competition where you test each other's knowledge. As I see it, it's enough to carefully study those endgames once and later review them just once a year or something like that. Four of these theoretical endings are covered in this chapter, as examples of how to work on endings. These four were chosen because they are quite common but still difficult. At the end of the chapter, I have listed one hundred endgames and attached asterisks to them to signify "necessary for everyone" down to "only for the most ambitious". It is an end in itself to vary the training methods. What's mentioned above is enough for me, but without a doubt, there are a lot of other training methods that also work well. One is playing correspondence games without an analysis engine, another is reading chess books. I think it's important that we challenge ourselves whatever we do, but I think it's even more important that we do what we enjoy. However, since we are all different, it's impossible to write a chapter about the final training method: enjoying chess. A Training Program 1 63 Goals Many players like to have a general goal for their chess improvement. I think it's more useful to have a goal that focuses on the biggest part of the time you spend on chess - your everyday training. I guess you are ambitious, if you have read this far. If so, there are some rules of thumb regarding goals: Process-based A goal of reaching a certain number of points in the next tournament or a specific rating doesn't tell you what to do. It can actually be fulfilled only with some more luck! It's better to set a process-based goal. One example is solving a number of exercises per day, another is learning a few endgames by heart. Short-sighted Naturally, it's important that a goal is time-limited. However, I don't think it's a good idea to set a goal to learn three new openings before an important tournament three months from now. It's easy to end up beginning to study them only when you are already in 'time trouble'. Instead, it's better to start with a goal of learning one opening in the first month. I also think it's a good idea to set new goals every month, since it also gives a natural occasion to evaluate the previous goals. Measurable It should be possible to evaluate your progress and check whether the goals have been fulfilled. In my training program for the spring of 20 1 2, my goals were formulated as below: 1) Analyse and annotate all games from the last tournament 2) 45 minutes tactical training, at least six days a week 3) Analyse all openings on my to-do list 4) Be able to focus completely for five minutes 5) Achieve a time of 7:30 minutes on the running track All of these goals were easy to measure and evaluate. If l wanted, I could have written down what I did each day in a training diary to check how the training was progressing. In addition, and at least as important, is that they were realistic. In the end, I achieved four of them. If you are wondering, I never managed to focus for five minutes without thinking of something else. The goals above covered four of the remaining five chapters in the book: analysing played games, tactics, openings and attitude. The final goal was physical. Being fit makes it easier to concentrate when playing long games, but for me it had a more important benefit: it allowed 1 64 Pump Up Your Rating me to stay reasonably focused during a whole training session. I didn't exercise much, but it was enough to 'clean out' my brain before the daily chess hours. Sometimes I regret that I need detailed goals for an everyday training program to be disciplined while working on chess. It is as if I don't really appreciate it. However, I enjoy every part of the program, and I think it has more to do with my personal characteristics. I would love to play one game only for entertainment, without any ambition, but so far, I haven't succeeded. Maybe that's a good future goal for me! One issue is that the flow of information is so high today; it's easy to get distracted. So I need rules against TY, Facebook and online newspapers. For sure, it means I miss a lot of interesting things, but it's not possible to do everything. Chess players create their own world, and luckily it's a pleasant world. Or, paraphrasing Hans Ree and Henry James Byron: Prophylactic measures are necessary to avoid life getting too short to waste on something beautiful, such as chess. A final word Never forget that your motivation to become better must come from yourselfl I've had the privilege of spending many hours a day working on chess, but for players with a full-time job, it may be possible only to use parts of everything that's proposed here. Fortunately, it's not hard to be disciplined with a hobby such as chess, since almost everything is enjoyable. Earlier, I compared chess with a language. To continue with this analogy, tactics may be the words, openings the grammar, endgames the spelling, and analysing your games the feedback to your writing. A language teacher will increase the students' level dramatically if she gets them to start reading books. It's the same with chess - the work needs to be done on your own. During my first years as a chess teacher, I always prepared my lectures carefully and handed out pamphlets. However, I didn't manage to get my students to work on their own. The aim of these chapters is to show the methods I wished they'd used. Chapter 5 The List of Mistakes How to analyse your games When you analyse a game, you practise your ability to calculate and you learn openings, middlegames and maybe endgames as well. Even more importantly, you learn how to find relevant ideas and details in a position and thus you practise decision-making, the process of selecting a move. That is, basically, everything you need when you sit down at the board! And if it's your own game, you are additionally noticing what kinds of mistake you usually make. To get the most out of an analysis session, it's good to collect the findings in a "List of Mistakes". I started doing that even before I had an Elo rating, and it has been the most important training form for me ever since. Chapter overview This chapter covers the whole process, from analysing a game and annotating it, to creating the List of Mistakes and drawing conclusions. In the first section, I show a game and explain how I analysed and annotated it. The second section contains a lot of mistakes that I have made, showing how it's possible to draw conclusions from them with the help of the List of Mistakes. There are six parts, with different types of mistakes. The first four are purely positional themes, but the last two are more related to my style of play. My personal list is: a) Preferring quantity over quality b) Overestimating the ideal pawn centre c) Exchanging heavy pieces d) Overestimating the passed d-pawn e) Bailing out in the critical moments f) Getting cautious in winning positions Mter that, it's time for the List of Mistakes, where every mistake in the chapter gets a note. The main categories in the list are Openings, Tactics, Positional, Thinking Model and Attitude, but all of them are also divided into a number of subcategories. 1 66 Pump Up Your Rating There is a challenge at the end of the chapter: four positions from one player, all of them with the same kind of mistake. Your task is to find a connection berween the mistakes. Analysing games It's difficult to analyse a game on your own, since you need someone to discuss it with. Ideally you have a trainer or another player who is at least as strong as you are, but that is a bonus. Any training partner is better than not having one. Sadly, it's not possible to find other ambitious chess players all over the world. In 20 1 1 , I moved to Kristiansund, a small town in Norway. Some months later I started to idealize past days in Lund when I could meet some friends to analyse a single game and suddenly notice that a whole day had passed. We had no other commitments and could just continue, day after day. What more could I ask for? That image of my life in Lund is not really the complete truth, but during some periods it was like that. In Norway, I was instead analysing over Skype, focusing mostly on the critical moments of the game - not the same thing at all. Accepting mistakes I have been very angry with myself after some games. In March 2007, my club in Lund played an important team match. It was a nice day when the sun finally seemed to chase winter away, and team spirit was great even though we had a long train journey. I was confident after some good tournaments and worried more about my teammates than my own game. I was White against the Dragon, could it be any easier? Early in the game, I played a nonchalant move and was soon mated. I ran to my hotel room, took an ice-cold shower and drank some alcohol. It's the only time I have tried to silence my conscience in that way, but it didn't help; I couldn't forgive mysel£ When I came back home, I decided to shut the curtains in my flat to keep the sunshine away until I was sure that I would never again make the same kind of mistake. For the same period, I didn't allow myself to shave. A month later, I pulled open the curtains, but guess what: I continued to make mistakes. When I see a young player cry after a loss, my first thought is that he has the potential to become dedicated. It's good to be competitive as a chess player, and not unsound to feel bad after a game. However, it definitely is wrong if it happens all the time. It might have helped my chess to forbid myself to enjoy the sunshine - the following month was very productive - but I did harm myself when I set the goal of never making the same mistake again. It is important to understand that we will continue to make mistake after mistake. A flawless game might one day be possible, but a flawless tournament is a fantasy. If we don't accept this, we will not be objective when we analyse our mistakes and we might even become afraid of losing. Players who get angry when they lose instead ofwhen they play badly are usually bad at accepting that they make mistakes. Instead, they are finding creative excuses, and it's common that they convince themselves that they only made one mistake in a lost game. In that way, they can explain the loss without confessing that they made several bad moves. Chapter 5 - The List of Mistakes 1 67 I have seen many players conclude that their first mistake was the only one, and since it happened early in the game, they think that they have to study openings. Those players turn a blind eye to the fact that they also have to practise other parts of their chess ability. Self-knowledge is an end in itself; I can't stress enough the importance of being objective. However, it's rarely an effective strategy to tell a person that he lacks self-knowledge. Instead, the List of Mistakes will hopefully open their eyes. Jesper Hall's advice is also clever; to make notes on the scoresheet immediately after the game. The notes can pinpoint both critical moments and positions where we think we erred. If we have those notes before we analyse the game, it's less likely that we will change our story. It's common that players who don't accept their mistakes think highly of themselves. That often makes analysis sessions unproductive. Either one player wants to show his strength by finding better moves than his friend, or the player who played the game doesn't want to admit that he made a number of mistakes. It's important to accept that everyone makes a lot of mistakes. I am happy when I find a new mistake, since I think that it will make me a better player. There was one good thing about my attitude that sunny day in 2007: I blamed my effort, not the result. In the end, my team actually won 4Yz-3� and my loss thus became unimportant. What I couldn't forgive myself was the nonchalance, stemming from laziness, which let my teammates down. The result depends on many factors, not least how your opponent plays. It's possible to play horribly and still win, and it's possible to play to the best of your ability and still lose. Without doubt, it's more important to draw conclusions from the first game. It is the same thing with the final result in a tournament: the performance rating or the number of points are misleading ways of evaluating your performance. Analysing without the help of a computer After my loss, I managed to avoid the temptation to check the "truth'' with an analysis engine. I think that's harmful, since it's almost impossible to ignore the computer's evaluations. At the upcoming analysis session, with a coach or a training partner, it's no longer normal intuition that is honed, but your intuition after a look at the computer's evaluation. That intuition is not as important, since it's not the one that's used at the board. Once again, I think the secret is to accept that everyone makes a lot of mistakes. If that's accepted, it's easier to avoid ruining the analysis session by checking the game with an engine. I advise my students to avoid checking their games with the computer. The games will not run away; there will be time to check them with a computer after they have been humanly analysed. However, few listen to my advice. Sometimes I forbid them to check the games with the computer. It has a clear effect: they are silent when we go through the games, trying to avoid revealing what they have done. With this in mind, I guess the readers might act in the same way, and first use a computer anyway. If you do, it's important to be curious. Why does the engine propose that move? Why could that move be played now, but not in the last position? Is that evaluation really true?

Check the lines, and work with them. Never be satisfied with the engine's move if you don't understand it. So, keep in mind to: A. Accept that you will always make mistakes A Be objective when you search for those mistakes A Evaluate your effort, not the result A Avoid checking your games first with an analysis engine, or if you do, work actively with it Annotating the game in ChessBase After having analysed the game, the next step is annotating it in ChessBase, with a lot of text comments. (For those who want to learn more about ChessBase and analysing with an engine, I refer to Chapter 7, Openings.) The annotations should not only contain the analysis, but also the subjective thoughts you had during the game. In that way, the reasons behind the bad moves are highlighted, and it will be much easier to return to the game and understand the mistakes we made. It's worthwhile to strive for high quality in the annotations, almost as if they will be published. (I have, by the way, also used my annotations as a way to practise foreign languages.) It's only when the annotation part is finished, that it's time for the engine to check the analysis. However, it's still important to try to understand why it disagrees every time it does. I'll start with one meta-example, where I annotate the game and at the same time comment upon the analysis session and annotations. Those comments are italicized. After the Rilton Cup in 20 1 1 / 1 2, I stayed an extra week in Sweden to take time to go through my games. This one, I analysed with Nils Grandelius. Before we started, I already had an idea where the critical moments were, and we focused mostly on those. There is nothing spectacular about the game, but it shows some important ideas regarding analysing and annotating. Bartosz Socko - Axel Smith Rilton Cup, Stockholm 2nd January 20 1 2 l.e4 c5 2.1��£3 e6 3.d4 cxd4 4.�xd4 a6 The Sicilian Kan. Black often falls behind in development, but the pawn structure with e6 and a6 is very solid, and White doesn't have any easy pawn levers. Socko is a well-known theoretician, and my choice to play the Kan was to a great extent based on the fact that I hadn't played it in the games published in
TWIC.

Black doesn't want to allow White to exchange two minor pieces, which happens after .Be4.

The advantage with 12.tl:la2 is that White can develop with 'Rd2 and E:ad1 without moving the knight again. The disadvantage is that the knight is passive. 12.tl:lb1 was played in a game by one of my students. With the knight on b 1 , it's possible to manoeuvre i t via d2 to c4.

and I found no reason to question that. When I checked the analysis with Houdini, I wanted to know if 1 5 ...g5 was a threat. There is a better way to find that out than making a waiting move like E:ab 1 : Ctrl+Alt+O enters a "null-move': The answer: it was a threat. If my coach would have analysed the game with an engine, he would have noticed that it prefers 14 ... tl:\f7, but such a conclusion makes little seme on its own. People usually have reasom to play as they do. As I had. And since I am my own coach, I can check the calculatiom with Houdini.

This mistake would not be noticed if the game was only analysed with Houdini, since the engine doesn't assess it as a better move. I am not sure.

It seems passive with the bishop on b7 and rook on a8, but White can't improve his position. The knight is standing in the way Chapter 5 - The List of Mistakes 173 of the b-pawn and the rook doesn't have any open files. Black may manoeuvre his knight to c5, thus overprotecting a6 and freeing all his pieces.

33 ... gxf4? This move is a mistake, even though it doesn't markedly change the evaluation of the position, which is still equal. It is a questionable decision to open the g-file when my rook is tied to the a-pawn, but I couldn't see how White could make use of the file. However, the most important reason for 33 ...g4 is that the h-file is much more interest ing for Black than the g-file, since White's rook can't use the entry square h l . Then ... ltJd6- e4-c5 combined with ...h5-h4 gives Black a pleasant position. Having heard Grandelius explain all this, I didn't have any objections.

It's important that we think about the reason behind the mistakes we make, so we know how to avoid them in the future. The only reason I didn't play 36 ... lDc5 was that I was short of time - another thing to write on the List of Mistakes. 37J:�gl Some problems have arisen after my stupid king move. Since it's clear that I had a bad position after move 40, we spent a lot of time trying to find improvements. However, since f4xg5 is never dangerous, there 1 is no reason to take on f4. The mistake can be """" ""- --" "" ""'- --'" ""'- --"'='- -- --' explained by laziness - I didn't want to check a b c d e f g h if f4xg5 could be dangerous every move. 37 ...�£6 Instead, I have some different options. a) 33 ...e5 looks nice, but White has 34.Bc4! with iDd5 next, and an advantage. b) 33 ... ltJd6 is good enough. c) 33 ...g4!? is Grandelius's favourite move, who said "The pawn must get closer to promotion!"

Be curious and check the lines until you understand the moves and evaluation. 6) Analyse the opening phase carefully - it's important to avoid preparation in future games. The seventh and last checkpoint is to write down bad moves in the List of Mistakes. The idea is to see which kinds of mistakes you make too often. Before I show one of those lists, I will give several examples of what I have learned when arranging my mistakes in this way. For me it's normal to use 30- 1 20 minutes to analyse the game, 1 5-30 minutes to annotate it, 1 0-20 minutes to check it with an engine and 5 minutes to update the List of Mistakes. Learning from mistakes The following examples show important lessons I have learned when using the List of Mistakes, but also give a lot of concrete advice about how to use the list.

Preferring quantity over quality As stated in the second chapter, it is a static advantage to have three pieces against a queen, two pieces against a rook or two rooks against a queen. The static advantage is often preserved even when the weaker side gets one or two pawns, and it's therefore natural to conclude that quantity (more pieces) should be preferred over quality (higher valued pieces). In the following game, I thought that it is always like that. Gustav Heden -Axel Smith Swedish Junior Championship, Goteborg 2005 l.c4 c5 2.<�Jc3 ltlf6 3.g3 d5 4.cxd5 ltlxd5

The mistake I made in this game was that I assumed the rooks were strong. I didn't ask Chapter 5 - The List of Mistakes myself the important question - how can they start working? And even more importantly, as learned in Chapter 2, can the opponent create dynamic (pawn) play? The more is not always the merrier. When we reached the position after 26.e5, I quickly realized that I had a bad position, but by then it was too late. In the next game, I continued to misjudge the position even after the exchanging operation.

There were two months between the games, but when I added the mistakes into the list, I realized the similarity. Apparently, I overvalued positions where I had more pieces than my opponent. For me, this insight was like seeing an apple falling from the tree. As a junior, I had often played l .e4 e5 with 2.tLlf3, 3.i.c4, 4.lt:lg5, followed by taking on fl.

37 . .i6t g4 38. .Bg2 1-0 I was 14 years old when the game was played and didn't understand why I had lost. A local trainer, Hans Frisk, taught me that you should have not just one, but even two pawns to enter that material constellation. I was stunned and even though I accepted what he said, I couldn't really understand it. To get that understanding represented good chess to me. Five years later, my eagerness to play good chess had made me believe that two pieces were always better than one. It was many years later that I actually learned Hans Frisk's motto was: "Quality over quantity". The solution to avoiding future mistakes is not going back to the Bc4, lt'lg5 and lt'lxf7- strategy. It's much easier than that. The initial evaluation is often good, but at the same time routine. I made the instructive mistake of not questioning it. What I needed was to carefully consider whether the pieces were able to cooperate against a target or not, and whether the side with the single piece had some dynamic (pawn) play. My thesis with the List of Mistakes is that gaining such knowledge about one's weak sides is a huge step towards avoiding them. If I am conscious about the fact that I overvalue two pieces against a rook, or two rooks against a queen, I should be able to adjust for that. Overestimating the ideal pawn centre For the moment, I find about five mistakes per game, and probably I made even more earlier. With 1750 games, I have thus made over 10,000 mistakes. To my students I often say that the player with the greatest number of mistakes wins! However, that's not enough - they also have to be recorded and analysed. Below are two similar positional mistakes, both from Cappelle la Grande 2008. Josef Gheng - Axel Smith Cappelle Ia Grande 1 8th February 2008 l.e4 e5 2.tlJ6 tlJc6 3 . .Bb5 tlJf6 4.d3 .Bc5

The reason White can claim a small advantage in many 1 .e4 e5 positions is the knight on c6. It can run into d4-d5 or Bxc6 and also stops Black from playing ...c6. Without the knight, Black suddenly has an easy and natural plan to occupy the centre with ... c6 followed by ...d5.

During the game I might even have rejected 1 2. .. d4. What then was my mistake? That I didn't even consider it!

Compared to the position in the previous game, there is an extra pair of knights, which favours White. The knight on c6 is easily tamed by the pawn on c3, and stops Black from defending the centre with ... c7 -c6. White's setup is similar to the King's Indian Attack, but her bishop on b3 is much more active. Hence, it seems to be a good idea to exchange bishops. However, 9 ...dxe4 10.dxe4 Be6 1 UWe2 Bxb3 12.axb3 improves White's structure and in an endgame with dark-squared bishops, White may profit from the fact that the pawn on eS is blocked on a dark square. In the previous game I was too ambitious, trying to enhance my centre by playing ... f5. In this game, I cleared a path for my c-pawn with 9 ... llJa5, which was, not so surprisingly, again too ambitious. I think that optimal play from Black's side requires a lot of patience, just waiting with a move like 9 ...h6. My ultimate conclusion is, however, that the problems started already when I played 6 ...d5. Lallemand simply defended the centre with 7.llJbd2! and with knights on f6 and c6, I have no natural pawn levers to strive for, as ... dxe4 still leaves the knight on c6 misplaced. Nowadays, I think it's easier to play the position after 6 ...d6 than the one after 6 ...d5. 9 . • • ttla5 10.J.a4 c6 l l• .lc2 c5 12.:Sel?!

With E:cl coming next, White has an obvious advantage. Instead in the game, I managed to draw after 79 moves. In the List of Mistakes I summarized the mistakes in the two games as follows: "I value the ideal centre too highly and continue to push pawns instead of stabilizing the centre." The ideal centre is strong in many positions, but I assumed that it was always good. According to the idea of the List of Mistakes, I would now consciously think about my habit of misjudging those kinds of positions during the next few tournaments. Later, my intuition would automatically warn against the misjudgements. Two months later I had a similar position.

The bishop would have been out of play on h7. After the game move, White should probably go for getting the bishop pair with Wfe2 and tLlc4. The question is whether this is enough for an advantage. If Black manages to exchange the dark-squared bishop, he should be completely okay, but White will prevent this. I think Black wants to keep the queens on because Black's is a natural defender of the e5-pawn. On the queenside I think White should answer ...a7 -a5 with a2-a4. In such positions White has normally played c2-c3 to cover the d4- square, but there is no need for this move in the game since Black's knights are a long way from d4. This makes a huge difference - the b3-pawn isn't weak after a2-a4 and the bishop on b2 is active, while at the same time hiding from exchanges. All in all, I think White holds a small advantage. Even so, 9 ...dxe4 is clearly the best move. l l.ttlh4 j,c5 12.tLl5 O-O 13.Wff3 l:!fe8

1/2-1/2 I have always performed far below normal at Cappelle Ia Grande, probably because it's a nice tournament where you spend several hours per day in the tournament restaurant. I need all available time to prepare. I showed this game to make the picture realistic; the List of Mistakes is useful but not a panacea. But it would have helped if I had reviewed the old lists, not for the sake of the memories (they are all sad!) but to remind myself of my weaknesses. Exchanging heavy pieces I include about 30 games - three tournaments and some league games - in each List of Mistakes. For people who don't play so often, it makes sense to have fewer games in each list. The following three games were played with just one month in between them. In all of them, I had problems with exchanging heavy pieces. Sinisa Drazic -Axel Smith Skanderborg GM, 20th October 20 1 0 l.d4 t2Jf6 2.ftlc3 d5 3.i.g5 h6 4.i.xf6 exf6

The knight is better than the bishop in this position, since Black has many pawns fixed on white squares. The pressure along the e-file won't win the e3-pawn, but at the moment it ties White to the defence of it. If White had his hands free, he would use one of the two semi-open files. Either he would double on the c-file followed by b4-b5, or he might penetrate on f6. Another plan for White is to carry out the pawn lever e3-e4, which takes space and creates tension in the centre. However, with the queens on the board, this will hardly be possible. Hence, Black should keep the queens. 31 ... '?Nd6?? I was afraid of tricks with tt:lc3xd5 followed by 'Rc7t and avoided them in the easiest way. The worries were not ungrounded, since 3 l ...'Rg6 32.tt:lc3 i.xd3 33.tt:lxd5! really is better for White.

With 33.g3 White would have a safe advantage. Later on, Black will probably have to play ... f5 to stop e3-e4, which shuts in the bishop. Then, White can slowly prepare for a break on the queenside with b4-b5. Instead White played 33.ttJc3 and the game was drawn in 54 moves. Never make a positionally dubious move only because it's the simplest solution against the opponent's threats! In the next example, the question is again which heavy pieces to exchange, if any.

To make the most out of such a position, the minor pieces should be exchanged but the heavy ones kept on the board.

Instead, 19.�ac l ! was self-evident, because it immediately makes use of the c-file and gives White pleasant pressure against the isolated pawn. So why did I make this mistake? I thought I had some possibilities to control the open file completely if I doubled my rooks. I didn't bother calculating the (few) variations until the end and just played a natural-looking move. Instead, I should have taken a step back to see the whole board, not only the open file. Then I would have realized that I wanted to keep the heavy pieces, and probably seen that 1 9.1'l:d3? exchanges some of them.

White has the better pawn structure and Black lacks play for his bishop, since the pawn structure on the kingside is symmetrical. If Black is kind enough to exchange a pawn on b3 and thus allow White to recapture with the c-pawn, White can use the rooks on the c-file to attack the weak pawn. Otherwise, it's difficult to use the rooks on that file. To exchange both rooks would be in White's favour since it's a much greater risk that the bishop ends up alone, controlling only half of the squares on the board. However, Black wants to exchange one pair of rooks to reduce White's influence on the d-file. Having said all this, it's not difficult to find the best move:
20.:ghdl !
Black is stopped from exchanging one pair of rooks without exchanging the other one. In the game, I played 20.lDca4?! and allowed Black to exchange one of the rooks after 20 ... :ghd8. Once again I saw only the open file, but not its connection with the rest of the game. Since I couldn't stop Black from playing ... :gd8, I didn't really consider :ghd l . The game eventually ended in a draw after 67 moves. The game below was played five months earlier, but I have included it since it sums up this kind of mistake very well.

Black has two minor pieces for the rook, but White has two extra pawns which are both on the same wing, giving a clear-cut plan in Chapter 5 - The List of Mistakes 1 89 the endgame. Since Black's pieces haven't any clear targets, the endgame will favour White slightly. Hence, it's best for Black to retreat with the queen. 33 ... Wfxd3? With the queens on the board, Black can try to attack White's king, while stopping the advance of the queenside pawns. I was in time trouble, but I understood that the exchange of queens was positionally wrong.

All of my moves would have been good if they had been working, or necessary if there was nothing else. However, since they were all anti-positional, I really had to know what I was doing before I decided to play such moves. I did not. What I didn't keep in mind was: Think about the positional considerations before deciding upon the candidate moves. In the next List of Mistakes there was nothing in the column for piece exchanges. That was satisfying! In the following game, I had to make another critical decision regarding the exchange of heavy pieces.

Starting from 28.Ei:dd7, the variation was 56 half moves long, which is too much even for Houdini. That's why it has problems evaluating the position! A human simply notices that White must capture three pawns on the kingside, while Black only has to capture two on the queenside. Thus, Black should win the pawn races. Such reasoning is not waterproof, but in this particular position it works better than Houdini's approach. 28 .. J:�c8 29.<j;lf2 <j;lf8 30.Ei:b7 h4 Fixing my pawns.

The number of pawns is equal, but the b5- pawn is weak and Black's rook has penetrated into White's camp. Firstly, I have to defend the e6-pawn, and then I want to surround the pawn on b5. What is the best square for the king? 30 ...�f7?! Of course this wasn't anything I wanted to play, since the king should be centralized in the endgame. However, I avoided 30 .. .'�e7 because of 3 1 .d5?! and I can't capture due to a knight fork. After 3 l ...e5 32.ltJe6 g6 33.e4, I was unhappy about White's protected passed pawn.

The knight is perfectly placed on d6, since l'l:a1 is always met by ... ttJxb5, defending a7. Black is better. I was so afraid of White's passed d-pawn that I could not imagine that the position could be good for me. The rest of the game is not important (0-1 in 55 moves). That summer's List of Mistakes ended in August. Just one month later I had a chance to test whether I had learned something. Now I was conscious that I often overvalued passed d-pawns.

White secures the king and plans a4-a5, winning the c5-pawn. If White manages to avoid the exchange of queens, then this position offers good winning chances. Who am I to question that? Anyway, I should have continued. In my List of Mistakes, this game rendered only one comment: accepting the draw offer. When I chose between 20.'Rd3 and 20.J.xa6, I clearly remembered the conclusion from the List of Mistakes, and managed to choose the right move. Bailing out in the critical moments So far, all the examples have been positional mistakes. They are the easiest to correct, but it's also possible to learn from miscalculations or other kinds of mistake. The critical moments are the most important positions to analyse. In those positions, you usually know what you want to achieve and even which move feels best, but now and then it's not possible to support the feeling tactically. In such situations, the positionally correct move actually works surprisingly often, even though the supporting tactics might be hard to find. During the autumn of 20 1 1 , I was not digging deeply enough to find them. The first game of the chapter, against Bartosz Socko, is one example where I had a lazy approach. Here is another.

The position looks messy, but it's clear that White's pieces are better placed. The battery on the bl-h7 diagonal has forced Black to create the weakness ...h6 and the queen is now ready to increase the pressure on the al-h8 diagonal. Black's queen, on the other hand, is on the

same line as White's rook. The general feeling is that White should be able to get an advantage.
17.�ce5?
This is a type of move that is really forbidden to play. White just exchanges his good pieces and leaves Black with a small initiative. The big problem is that I knew it was wrong, but played it anyway!

react. a) 17. .. lt::l 5f6 18.lt::l fe5 This is better than on the last move, since Black doesn't have ...

I didn't look deeper, but of course I should have! It's not difficult to see that White can easily fix this small problem. Firstly, 1 8.i.g6 wins a tempo. After 1 8. .

In a Sicilian Kan, I have just launched my h-pawn towards my opponent's king. Even though it seems strange, I think h2-h4 is White's best reply. It weakens the king, but on the other hand - where should Black place his king? After 1 2.a4, I wanted to play 1 2. .. h4 myself, to stop White from getting his pawn to that square. To be able doing this, I have to calculate some tactical lines starting with 1 3.axb5 axb5
14.Bxb5. Does it work for Black?

1 5.h4! is still best, but after 1 5. .. ttlg4 Black has a slight advantage anyway. It's interesting to note that h2-h4 creates a strong outpost for Black's knight, but only because White's d-pawn has been exchanged! The reason is that White's f-pawn has to cover the squares on the g-file, since the h-pawn has advanced, and also cover on the e-file, since the d-pawn is exchanged. It can't cover both g4 and e5, and Black can thus have his knight on one of those squares.

I think it's theoretically better for Black to play 7 ... cxd4 and transpose to a Maroczy position in the Accelerated Dragon. The position with the knight on a5 can be compared to the Yugoslav variation in the King's Indian. There, Black plays concretely to get the knight doing something meaningful, but this is not possible in the game. Black can try to attack the pawn on c4 with ... a6, ... :i:!b8 and ...b5, but White has no problems defending it. If Black plays ...e6xd5, White should avoid cxd5, because then Black can give some life to the knight with ...c4. In the long term, White wants to attack on the kingside with f4-f5. If the knight is still out of play this should be more or less strategically winning. Let's move on quickly to the position 1 5 moves later. 9 ...a6 10.Vfc2 e6 ll.b3 exd5 12.exd5 .Bf5?! 13 . .Bd3 .Bg4 14.�el Black's bishop manoeuvre only helped White to free his f-pawn. 14 ... b5 15.h3 .Bd7 16.gbl gbs 17.ttle2 ge8 18.ttlg3 Yfb6 19.Yfcl Yfc7 20.£4 bxc4

This is the position I really want to show. Black's knight has just recently left a5, but it is still not doing much, while White is ready to play f4-f5 next. This is exactly what White is aiming for, and he should be strategically winning. However, it all starts to go wrong.
25.h4?
It may be a good idea to weaken g6 further, but it's too kind to give Black extra time to defend.
25.f5! surrenders the e5-square, but sometimes
you have to give something to get something. What I get is much more important - it's the black king. The first threat is fxg6 followed by either lDxt7, lDxh7 or i.xg6. Black can try to defend with 25 ... lDe5, but then 26.lDh5! is a killer. After 26 ... .1Dxd3 27.lDxg7 �xg7

After 29.Rxe2, I should have looked for a dynamic solution until I found one. The solution is 29 ... Rf7! 30 . .txa7 .taG. Black plans ... lt:lf6 with a double threat. After 3 I ..tf2 lt:ld4, Black has ... .txd3 followed by ... Rxf4, if nothing else. The conclusion from these four games can be summarized with the secret of the Soviet Chess School: if you need to do something, do it! Ask what the position demands, and try to get an appropriate move to work. Getting cautious in winning positions The problem of not trying to play the best move is even more apparent in winning positions, where it's easy to become nonchalant. Nothing is more irritating than unnecessarily giving away a half-point. The remedy is to try to play the best moves all the way till the end in every game - even when you have a lot of extra material. There is nothing wrong with being rational and choosing a safe option, but in many cases the reason is really nothing but pure laziness. In most winning positions a final calculation has to be made anyway. The earlier, the easier. Here is one tragic example.

Having three passed pawns extra is nice, but Black has some attack with the opposite coloured bishops. It's time to take the bull by the horns and calculate the win to the end. Chapter 5 - The List of Mistakes 205

39J�d6!? This is a good move, but only with the correct continuation, which I hadn't seen. There was another win with 39.Bf5!. a) The reason to move the bishop is to avoid Black from capturing it after: 39 ... l::1 xf2

After ...cxd5, Black will get a rook and two pawns for the two bishops. Normally I would favour the two bishops, but they have no clear task yet. The rooks are best when there are as few pieces as possible on the board, so Black should be happy with the exchange of queens.

1-0 In this game, I managed to continue playing the hardest moves when I got an advantage. However, it's easy to fall back into a lazier approach, so I will continue to remind myself by looking at my old Lists of Mistakes. Let's move on to one of those.
210 Pump Up Your Rating
The List of Mistakes Conclusions The List of Mistakes categorizes mistakes in groups, and pinpoints common mistakes. The idea is that gaining the knowledge of common mistakes is a huge step towards avoiding them. During the next tournament(s), you have to think consciously about the new knowledge, but later it will hopefully become subconscious - part of your intuition. It's important to look for every mistake; don't forget games that you have won. Every List of Mistakes can contain 30 games or less, depending on how often you play. It's a good idea to review old Lists of Mistakes from time to time. Positional mistakes are the easiest to correct. Creating a List of Mistakes The first thing I do is write down all the mistakes in a text document. Take the game from the beginning of the chapter as an example: Bartosz Socko - Axel Smith 1 5. ..�h8? - unnecessary prophylaxis. I don't need the move since I always get good compensation if he takes the pawn on h6. 18 ... i.xg5?! - inexact move order. 18 ... ltk4 avoids 'Rxb4. 28 ... g6?! - it was better moving the g-pawn two steps to gain some space. 33 ...gxf4?! - I open a file for his rook. Instead, after 33 ...g4, I could have played for opening the h-file in the long run. 36 ... <.f:?e7?! - I was in time trouble and played a meaningless move. 38 ... <.!:7£7? - I should not accept playing such a passive move in a critical position! When I have written down the mistakes, it's time to create the List of Mistakes. The list below shows the games in this chapter. Since I have chosen which games to include, some categories are empty, but believe me, usually I make every kind of mistake! If you find it interesting, you can cover the column with the number of mistakes, copy the list and add every mistake that you find in this chapter. If you do, I am sure that our categorization will differ, but that does no harm as long as both are logical. Which categories should be used in the List of Mistakes? It depends on the mistakes! Sometimes I'll start with a blank page and add a category for every new kind of mistake, and sometimes I'll use an old scheme. There isn't any right or wrong way - the categories can be set in any way that suits your mistakes. In my case the category "misjudging" has to be split, into "Overestimating pawn centre" and "Overestimating the passed d-pawn". Other possible subcategories are king safety, initiative, importance of pawn structure, bad bishops, central control and passed pawns. I have pointed out all the mistakes that change the verdict of the position, from won to drawn or from drawn to lost, as big ones. Chapter 5 - The List of Mistakes 2 1 1 LIST OF MISTAKES (23 games) Category Type of mistake number of mistakes (big in brackets) Opening Tactics Positional Quality of opening analysis Understanding Preparation, remembering Big blunder Miscalculation Missing candidates Blunder check Not calculating deep enough Wrong plan Pawn levers Piece exchanges Piece placement Misevaluation Overestimating pawn centre Overestimating passed d-pawn Missing prophylactic moves Unnecessary prophylaxis Thinking model Not assessing the position Playing without a follow-up Not setting clear aims Not getting the logical move to work Overly cautious Attitude Bad concentration, nonchalance Time trouble Playing too fast (in critical moments) Not objective (due to bad/good trend) Afraid of losing 1 1 3 4 4 3 (1) 1 (1) 1 3 (1) 7 (2) 4 (2) 2 Much is already won when the list is finished. All the mistakes have been examined again, giving important repetition. However, you should not be satisfied with that - the idea is also to see which mistakes you make too often. Hence, I write a few lines when it's time to sum up. I overvalue two rooks against a queen (plus pawns) and two minor pieces against a rook (plus pawns). To avoid doing this, I should not trust my intuition alone, but make a conscious assessment of the position, seeing whether the pieces are able to cooperate against a target or not. I overestimate the ideal pawn centre, and don't even consider moves that give it up. With the knowledge of this weakness, I will hopefully avoid it in the future. I make many mistakes when exchanging heavy pieces, since I think too concretely. I have to make positional considerations before I look for candidate moves.

I overestimate the passed d-pawn. Also in this case, the knowledge should be enough to avoid doing so again. In winning positions, I am often too cautious, not going for the most direct win. In the critical moments, I become lazy and often choose a quite passive move. I must give my full effort and try to get the most logical move to work! If I avoid a variation, I must have a reason. I have some problems with time trouble, but not much. As usual, I should continue trying to play even faster. The positional mistakes are easy to categorize. A few times, I have also tried splitting the tactical mistakes into details, such as backward moves, presuming that a threatened piece has to move, not considering pawn moves in front of the king, missing unusual moves, missing sacrifices, etc. However, I have seldom managed to get any useful information by doing so. Personally, I think the psychological mistakes are the most interesting. One time I found that I assessed my position too pessimistically after I realized that I had made a mistake. Another time I found that I became slightly desperate in bad positions. These kinds of mistake are the easiest to correct. That can't be said about the last two conclusions in my summary above. They are even a contradiction. If I try to calculate every critical variation, I will not play faster than before. It's important to find a balance, and to feel when there is a critical position where thorough calculation is required. By gaining more experience, and pointing out where I have problems, I will hopefully improve even with that. When I make a new List of Mistakes, I copy the old conclusions and check whether the same mistakes are made or not. Hopefully, most of them have disappeared. Club: Lunds ASK Born: 1 986 Frisk has been a member of Lunds ASK since 1994, and was the club's president from 2008-10. She has represented Sweden in the European Team Championship and in the Olympiad. Frisk made two WIM norms in 2012. Chapter 5 - The List of Mistakes 213 Helping others The first thing I do when I am coaching a student is to create a List of Mistakes. Some typical mistakes are usually highlighted already after a few games, but the main point is to help the student to get started. Later on, the student can analyse the games with a friend, annotate them and add them to their List of Mistakes. The games and the list are sent by mail to the coach. His task is to comment on the positional thoughts in the annotations and making some conclusions from the mistakes - of course without using an analysis engine. One advantage with such an approach is that the coach's time is spent effectively. When I got together with Ellinor, my future wife, in 2008, we didn't do any chess together at all. I thought our relationship was more important than a nerdy hobby. She got her motivation back two years later, when she was selected for the Swedish women's team in the Olympiad. At the same time, I had grown up and no longer had any need to appear normal. We both enjoyed chess, so why not? The first step was creating a List of Mistakes for her. We found a lot of things: she was too cautious with advancing the flank pawns, a bit reckless with her king's safety, automatically thought that a bishop was stronger than a knight, underestimated the importance of development and never saw the possibility to fianchetto the bishops. After every tournament, she checked if she had managed to avoid those mistakes. During the next 1 6 months, she made steady progress and increased her Elo from 2 1 1 3 to 221 8; another example that you don't have to be a junior to improve. In 20 12, she became employed, had to decline a spot for the next Olympiad and lost her motivation. The lesson is clear: never get a job. Below are four positions from her games and the moves she played. All of them are the same kind of mistake. Your task is to find out what she needed to learn for future games.

White is a pawn down, but doesn't have such bad prospects since she has a moderate lead in development and Black's king is stuck in the centre.

Against White's 7.g4 in the Semi-Slav, Black has grabbed the pawn but fallen behind in development. The dream is to castle long before the position opens up, but first she needs to take care of the h7-pawn.
15. .. tLlxd2?
I agree that Black wants to exchange on d2, since the knight may be vulnerable on f3 if White pushes e3-e4. However, there is no reason to take immediately, since the bishop isn't going anywhere. After the most logical move, 1 5. ..h5, White has to spend a tempo on �b l or .te2 to force Black to take. That said, there is actually one argument for taking on d2 - if White takes back with the queen, Black doesn't have to move the h-pawn at all. But since I think White wants to take with the rook anyway, this argument isn't important. 16J�xd2 h5 17.f4 .Bd7 18J3dh2 h4 19.'YNf2 White managed to use Black's inaccuracy with 1 5. . .lt:Jxd2 to win back the pawn immediately. Black will manage to castle and keep the bishop pair, but the one on d7 is very cramped. I think White's position is easier to play. White won in 80 moves.

I will make a few comments about this game a few moves earlier than the position I showed a few pages ago. In a French Steinitz, Black has pushed the pawns on the queenside. White's plan is to create a kingside attack after the pawn lever f4- f5, but this is difficult to achieve. Most times, Black can just capture the pawn. For Black, ...b4 and ... .ta6 are the positional moves, but since the rook on aS is hanging, she should not play 1 3. ..b4 at once. 13• • . .Ba6?!

'1'xe3t?! This helps White to develop the knight, connect the rooks and play E!:fb 1 next. Instead, an exchange on b6 would have helped Black improve the knight. So there was no argument in favour of exchanging the queens. Instead, Black could have considered several other candidate moves: ... E!:ac8, ... E!:fc8 and ... f6.
17.�xe3 gfc8? 18.a4!
Black was worse already before the last mistake, but now she also has huge problems with the b5-pawn, since ... bxa4 is met with b4-b5. White won in 36 moves. Ellin or Frisk - Leszek Kwapinski Rilton Cup, Stockholm 27th December 20 1 1 Frisk was confused after the game. She knew that her opponent had made an inaccuracy in the opening and although she thought she had played the most logical moves, she didn't get any advantage. What did she do wrong? Here are the ten moves that preceded the diagram position. I.e4 c5 2.�c3 �c6 3 . .Bb5 We might consider this a form of Accelerated Rossolimo. The point is to take on c6 and follow up with f2-f4, after which White's flexible pawn structure will secure a pleasant position. 3 ... �d4 There is also a disadvantage to lDf3 not having been played! 4 . .Bc4 e6 5.�ge2 a6 Black correctly inserts the moves with the a-pawns, since it takes away the b5-square from White's pieces.
6.a4 b6?!
6 ... lDf6 is the most common move, developing and at the same time stopping lDxd4.
7.�xd4

We have reached the diagram poslt!on. Black seems to be threatening both ... hg2 and ... Bxc4, but White has several ways to react. ll. .Bxd5?! Chapter 5 - The List of Mistakes 217 This was played without much reflection - the intuition to avoid doubled pawns was never questioned by Frisk. Actually hd5 just helps Black to develop, while ...hc4 isn't a threat at all since it weakens the d4-pawn. In addition, the new pawn on c4 would be easily defended. 1 1 .ttJxd4? hg2 1 2.E!:g1 .Bb7 is anti-positional for White, because she can't castle short anymore. 1 1 .O-O! is better. a) Black can't just develop since 1 1 . .. ttJf6 1 2.ttJxd4! .Bxg2 1 3.ttJxe6 loses a pawn. b) 1 l .. . .Bxc4 1 2.dxc4
[diagram]
Now there are two options to consider: b1) 12 ... .Bc5 White has ideas with .Bf4-e5, simply doubling on the d-file, opening up with c2-c3 or kicking the bishop with b2-b4. Most exact is 13.a5!, which creates a square on a4 for the knight after c2-c3 next. b2) 1 2. ..e5?! looks dangerous, as Black is several tempos behind in development. 1 3.c3 d3 ( 1 3. .. dxc3 14.lDxc3 gives White an initiative.) 14.lDg3

The pawn on d3 will be rounded up with E!:fl -e 1-e3. c) 1 l ... .Bb7! is actually the best move, even though it looks provocative to move the bishop again. It's an argument against 1 1 .O-O, however castling is still the best move. When Black's bishop has retreated, White should try to open the position with 1 2.c3, with some initiative. l l. .. Y!Yxd5 12.O-O Black could have continued with a normal developing move such as 1 2. .. ttJf6. White can try 13.c3, but Black is fine. Instead the game continued 12 ... .Bd6 1 3.c4 dxc3 14.ttJxc3 and White won in 3 1 moves. What is the connection between these four mistakes? Frisk exchanged pieces voluntarily, losing tempos! In the first game it helped her opponent develop the knight, in the second it allowed the rook to the h-file, in the third it connected the rooks, and in the last example it developed the queen. In the List of Mistakes, we concluded that she had to be more careful about the elements of time and development when exchanging pieces. The player who exchanges often loses a tempo!

[diagram]
In this position, White has two main plans. The first is to exchange the e-pawn for Black's d-pawn with e2-e4, then exchange all the pieces to get a winning pawn endgame. This is the same strategy as in the Exchange Ruy Lopez, except with the healthy majority on the queenside. However, a lot can happen before all the pieces are exchanged. Most often White instead plays for a strategy based on the pawn lever c2-c4. After ... dxc4, White has two pawns in the centre, while Black has none. The pawn duo secures some space, which makes it easy to play with the knights. Quite often it's possible to exchange one of the knights for one of Black's bishops. Going back to the game, after 4 . .Bxf6 exf6, White doesn't have the possibility to push c2- c4, since the knight is already on c3. Hence, Black only needs to stop e2-e4, or secure adequate counterplay ifWhite manages to play it. I think this is possible, so I do not approve ofWhite's position after 4 . .Bxf6 exf6. Instead, Frisk played:
4.f3
Her idea was to push e2-e4 before she takes on f6. 4 ... ll:lbd7 5.lLlxd5!? is also a point. 4 •. .h6?

As I said in the beginning of the chapter, it's difficult to see a computer evaluation without letting it have a great influence upon your intuition. That's why I have waited until now to reveal a secret: none of Frisk's moves in the diagram positions above are mistakes according to the computer! Nevertheless, the moves were dubious, and the fact that the engines don't understand that shows the advantage of analysing with a human and writing down verbal annotations. With the computer alone, Frisk's mistakes would not have been found. Conclusion Schedule for the List of Mistakes 1) Analyse your games with a friend; avoid using an analysis engine 2) Annotate the game in ChessBase, and highlight your mistakes 3) Check the analysis with an engine, and update the annotations 4) Write down the mistakes in a text file 5) Collect all the mistakes in a List of Mistakes, where they are sorted into various categories 6) Make conclusions about typical mistakes, and how they should be avoided in the future When I wrote this chapter, I was living in Kristiansund, Norway and was missing the days when I could analyse games with friends in Lund all day long. That was one of the reasons I moved back to Sweden, but today there are other things I miss. The sea and the mountains in Norway have been replaced with a pond and an 85-metre-high refuse dump in Sweden. I am happy that at least the chessboard is the same wherever I travel. I hope these examples have shown how to work with the List of Mistakes. The first and most important thing is to analyse the games with someone who doesn't express his opinion only in decimal numbers. And then annotate the game thoroughly. The List of Mistakes presented in this chapter contains dozens of categories. The ambition doesn't need to be that high - it can be a simple list scribbled down on a piece of paper. What is necessary is starting to reflect about the mistakes. Some are difficult to avoid, others will disappear as soon as they are spotted! It's not possible to avoid every mistake, but I am sure that it will hone your intuition to work with the List of Mistakes. Chapter 6 The Woodpecker Method Club: Lunds ASK Born: 1 985
GM: 20 10
Tikkanen became a member of Lunds ASK at the age of 14, and moved to Lund when he was
19. At that time, he had lost his motivation for chess, and instead tried both Go and half
hearted studies at university. However, with the new environment he soon regained his old passion for chess. In the spring of 2010, he created The Woodpecker Method and only months later he made three GM norms in seven weeks. Tikkanen won the Swedish Championship in 2011, 2012 and 2013.

Chess is 99% tactics - Richard Teichmann Like so many maxims, there is some truth in Teichmann's quote. Despite this, pracnsmg calculation is quite a small part of most players' chess training. The reason, I believe, is that it's difficult to define exactly what you have learned. That desire for tangible results is very human ("Today I memorized 30 moves of Griinfeld theory'') but even so there is nothing more valuable at the board than being able to calculate well. Chapter overview This chapter begins with a discussion about tactical training, with Hans Tikkanen as the model player. Tikkanen improved a lot when he started to work systematically and he also inspired a Danish friend to even greater improvements. The general advice is to make the training similar to a game situation. One way of achieving that is using a chess clock. The second section deals with tactical motifs. It facilitates calculation to know their features by heart. One of the motifs has not been named before: the lifeline. The chapter contains 5 1 exercises of varying degrees of difficulty. Most of them (1 2+6+ 1 2+6) are presented before each tactical motif, but the last section also holds 1 5 challenging exercises. Tactical training Hans Tikkanen is interested in studying the human brain, its structure and function. His training program was designed to fit the way that humans learn to intuitively recognize patterns. Tikkanen started by solving quite simple tactical exercises. When he finished, after about 1 000 exercises, he took a short break, and then started all over again on the same exercises. And when he finished for a second time, he started a third time, and so on. Tikkanen's results were convincing - his three GM norms the following summer gained him more than 1 00 Elo points. I have therefore named the training program after him: The Woodpecker Method. This comes from the meaning of 'Tikkanen' in its original language, Finnish. However, as Tikkanen is a somewhat mysterious and modest person, he doesn't want to explain the underlying theories or exactly how he did it. What I have written in this chapter is therefore my interpretation, but as I have followed him closely, it's hopefully close enough! There is another sunny story about this method's effectiveness - the Danish player Andreas Skytte Hagen, who also plays for Lunds ASK. Since 2006 he has been a serious chess player: playing, analysing openings, reading books and solving exercises. However, his progress was modest until he met Tikkanen at a tournament. Suddenly, Hagen increased from 2290, in March 20 1 1 , to 2454, four months later. It turned out that both Tikkanen and Hagen had read the same book: Geoff Colvin's Talent is overrated (20 10). Colvin proposes a tough training program with repeated exercises. Feedback should be given after each training session, which means using a timekeeping and points system. In that way, progress can be seen from day to day. Chapter 6 - The Woodpecker Method 223 The difference between Tikkanen and Hagen was how they interpreted the word repeated. Tikkanen understood it correctly - exactly the same exercises should be solved several times. When Hagen started doing so, he was hugely successful! Tikkanen worked for six to ten hours a day. For people with normal non-chess jobs, it would take many months to work through 1000 exercises. Therefore, I recommend that amateurs cut it down to "only" a few hundred. However, I think it's important to have at least a few long sessions for the brain to get really into it. When you see the exercises for the second time, you will remember some of the moves. That is both because your repertoire of standard moves has increased and because you remember the last time you tried to solve the exercise. A typical line of thought: "I spent twenty minutes on the train with this one. When I found the solution, the train had passed my destination. I should have seen the move earlier!" But remembering the first move is not the same as the solution! You should calculate the variations until the end as if you haven't seen the position before. That is important - the brain must understand the underlying tactics and be trained to calculate the variations to the end. Being able to quickly screen the position for possible defences is important to improve speed of calculation. The tactics books Tikkanen and Hagen used were not the secret. Hagen says he uses any random book, and Tikkanen has even used quite bad ones. I repeated his training program, not with the same diligence, but still with clear results. The solutions at the end of the book I used are completely scribbled over with my corrections - many of the exercises were wrong and even unsolvable. For that reason, I will not recommend a specific book - any will work! But, you may ask, isn't it better with instructive and carefully chosen exercises? I don't think it makes much difference. It's a bit like running intervals. If there is something wrong with your running style, you need instructions, but after that you simply need to do a lot of hard work. However, I do prefer books where the solutions are given with extensive annotations. It's disturbing if various logical defences are not covered or if there is no mention of promising tries that don't quite work. One chapter in Move First, 1hink Later is named "Trust your chess module". Willy Hendriks argues that you subconsciously arrange the ideas you learn when you solve tactical exercises; you improve your pattern recognition ability without noticing it. This is in line with the discussion about verbal overshadowing from the introduction. Hendriks quotes GM Leonid Gofshtein from Amatzia Avni's 1he Grandmaster's Mind: "I used to play with my head, now I play more with my hand." This captures the point quite well: Don't try verbalizing what you have learned, let your automatic chess module take care of it. You have to trust that mechanism; it's the teacher of your intuition. A lot of calculation is about two things: speed and pattern recognition. But I hope I made it clear in Chapter 4 that some structure doesn't hurt as well.

Tactical motifs Tikkanen started by carefully examining the tactical motifs - the subject of the next section. The exercises were sorted by motif in the first books he used. Much is gained if you automatically know the possible defences against a pin, to take one example. However, during a game there are no hints that tell if there is a special motif available. So the next natural step is to mix the motifs. How much time should you spend practising the motifs? The best and only answer I can give is - until you feel that you know them well enough. Tactical exercises When it comes to solving tactical exercises, you should remember that you are not only practising your tactical ability, but also concentration, time management and decision making. After having set up the pieces and looked at the position for some minutes, it's possible to take a coffee break and continue much later on. During a game, it's not. And since the training situation should be made similar to a game, l think there are a few useful principles: Always choose a move You don't have to solve every exercise, but if you don't find the solution, you still have to choose a move to play; just as in a game. Furthermore, the exercises must be solved in order, without moving back and forth between them. Take responsibility for the move Often, the tactical motif is spotted quickly, especially if you have seen the position before. But as written above, that is not the same thing as the solution. You should check the variations like in a game. And try to avoid the Process of Elimination, which unfortunately works quite well when you know there is a solution. You have no reason to blame yourself if you don't find the correct move, but you are to blame if you found it but didn't bother to check the variations. Use a chess dock Give yourself a limited amount of time. This is important; it prevents you just enjoying yourself instead of focusing! The normal way is to solve as many exercises as you can manage in a fixed time. Another way, which has additional educational gains, is to decide upon a fixed time for a number of exercises. If you solve the first exercise quite fast, you get more time for the next, and vice versa. Thus, you have to take responsibility for how much time to spend on each exercise. If you don't find the solution in one of them, at some point you have to choose a reasonable move to save time for the following exercises. When the time runs out, you must have chosen a move in all of the exercises. Otherwise, you lose on time and should give yourself zero points in all of them! Award yourself points Points, ratings and records are rewarding, and motivate you to push yourself to the maximum. Tikkanen and Hagen tried solving the exercises faster every time they repeated them. Hagen had Chapter 6 - The Woodpecker Method 225 a daily one-hour session and gave himself one point for each exercise he solved, and deducted five points when he failed. And he didn't allow himself to move on to a new section of exercises until he had scored highly enough! In fact I like a modified points system better: - The first mistake is not having any points deductions - you have to avoid any tendency to become a perfectionist. - If you don't find the solution, you should only get two points deducted. - However, if you fail because of carelessness, missing a possible defence or not calculating the variations to the end, you should get a five points deduction. However, I think it makes even more sense to avoid spending too much energy calculating the points! When I used the Woodpecker Method for the second time, I had four daily one-hour sessions with a short break in-between, and simply tried to solve as many exercises as possible in each session. In a way, the points system was a bluff, since the main component to success was to be "lucky" and get simple exercises. However, the points system was enough to trick my brain into believing it had to use every second wisely during the session. The conclusion is that you should make up your own points system. Anything that can make you work harder has value. Exercises, not studies The calculations you have to make during a game are often quite simple and seldom study like. It should not be harder when practising. In addition, it's tempting to start thinking about something else if the exercise is too difficult. No chatting It's very nice to solve exercises with friends, but there is a risk that focus will be lost. When one exercise is finished, I want to start on the next one, without listening to an explanation of why one of us didn't find the solution. By now, it's time to make a summary of The Woodpecker Method. 1) Study all the tactical motifs, and solve thematic exercises, until you feel that you know them well enough. 2) Choose a number of tactical exercises, from 1 00-200 for the normal amateur, to 1 000 for the serious professional. Solve them intensively and compete with yourself, by recording the time and awarding points. 3) Take a break for at least a day but not more than a couple of weeks. 4) Use the same set of tactical exercises and try to solve them faster. Tikkanen used fifty percent less time for the second round.

5) Continue until you think you are fast enough. Tikkanen stopped when he managed to solve all the exercises in less than a day, but that meant a whole day! 6) If the program has whetted your appetite, choose a new set of exercises. Humans are creatures of habit, and need to enjoy what they are doing. Hence it's important to create good habits. The brain usually puts up some resistance against solving exercises, as it would against any demanding activity, but after a few days of persistence, it may already become an addiction! Other forms of tactical training Working with the Woodpecker method is like running in a hamster wheel, so other forms of tactical training are not really necessary. But for some, varying is an end in itself. Playing blindfold is good practice for visualization. On the other hand, I believe less in going through games blindfold. When you play, you make half of the moves yourself and thus give both your own and your opponent's moves meaning. It makes it easier to visualize and remember. When playing through games, the same meaning becomes a bit artificial; you only need to remember vaguely where the pieces are placed. If blindfold sounds difficult, it is possible to start with a more moderate goal. Jesper Hall recommends not moving the pieces when analysing games with friends. For many months, I started every day with 45 minutes on chess.com, one of the Tactical Trainers that's available on the net. These programs comply with most of the requirements above: you have to choose a move, there is a clock with a limited time, you have to find all the moves to the end, your performance is measured with a rating, no exercise is impossible, and the website doesn't chat with you. But is a two-dimensional screen really similar to a real game? No, but on the other hand it saves a lot of time not having to set up the pieces. It's the same as solving directly from the diagrams in a book. If you don't experience problems, then go ahead. However, there is one big difference to the Woodpecker's Method: the same exercises are not solved again. And remember that Hagen improved only when he started doing that. Hagen also thinks that the exercises on chess.com are too difficult. He likes the idea of a database with tactical exercises, though. Today's players already have an advantage over the pre computer generation, but it will be nothing compared to the day a big tactical database appears. The database will automatically analyse your solutions and give you new exercises on the themes where you are weak. When children have grown up with such a database, they will become tactical monsters. At least this is what Hagen thinks. Tactical motifs One good book that covers tactical motifs in detail is Understanding Chess Tactics (2007) by Martin Weteschnik. It was one of the first books that Tikkanen read. Chapter 6 - The Woodpecker Method 227 It's possible to play a smothered mate without knowing it in advance, and no gain in itself to knowing the name. However, there are reasons to study the tactical motifs. It is simply easier to calculate variations involving a pin, when you already know the standard possible defences. There are many ways to categorize the tactical motifs. I think that most ways will work equally well, but I have chosen the one that strikes me as most logical. The first division is between threats, double threats and other motifs. Before presenting each of the tactical motifs, I have included a block of exercises. You have to work to earn something! I also make it a bit harder by making sure there isn't a clear cut solution in every exercise, thus making it impossible to use the Process of Elimination. I have also proposed a time limit for the exercises. It's set for a player with Elo of about 2300, with the idea that it should be quite stressful! So feel free to adjust as appropriate to your own level. The tactical motifs only need to be carefully studied once. However, it's worthwhile to occasionally think about them when solving exercises, or examining tactical mistakes from your games. Threats A threat is dangerous if the target is undefended or of a higher value than the attacker. Not only pieces, but also squares may be possible targets. However, undefended pieces are by far the most common cause of tactical combinations, so keep an extra eye on them! 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 Smith 2012

White threatens the queen on e8 - obviously it's higher valued than the rook. He also threatens the undefended knight on c4 and the h4-square, giving mate. l • • • Y"d8= The queen and the king were the most important threats to defend against; there is no way to defend against all three threats. There are five ways ofdefending against a threat: - Capturing the attacker - Moving the threatened piece - Defending the threatened piece or square - Putting a piece in between - Making a stronger counter-threat Possible defences are the main theme in the following five examples.

Instead, White can move the queen and continue to defend the bishop. However, both possibilities lead to devastating pins: a) 1 8.Wfb4 Wfxe4 when the bishop on e2 is en prise. b) 1 8.Wfd1 l'!fd8 1 9.e5 Wfe4 White can win back the pawn with 20 . .i£3 Wfxd4t 2 l .Wfxd4 l'!xd4 22 . .Bxb7. Black is only slightly better. One possibility is 22 ... l'!b8 23.l'!ab 1 g5 and White will get a weak pawn on either f4 or g5. Intermediate checks are the most usual gain of tempo, since the opponent must react. Double threat Against a threat, there were five ways to defend. With a double threat, only two of these ways work - capturing the attacking piece or making a stronger counter-threat. However, there are also two additional defences: a) Moving one of the pieces and putting it in between the attacker and the second target. It only works if the interrupting piece moves to a defended square and is worth less than the attacker. b) Moving one of the pieces while defending the second. It works if the second target is worth less than the attacker. Against double threats, there is a specific type of counter-threat that's often overlooked. I'll give a few exercises on the theme before I reveal what it is. When you have solved the first, the others get easier. Give yourself 30 minutes for the six exercises.

The bishop on c4 and the knight on b6 are pinned, since White's rook and queen are undefended. However, both the bishop and the knight are adequately defended and it seems difficult to threaten them.

There is little doubt that Black is on top with a rook and three pawns against two minor pieces. White's pieces aren't close to coordinating against a target. So the tactical try didn't work this time. Instead, l .e4 is White's best move, with a positional advantage. It's important to note that pinned pieces are quite useless defenders. Normally, you first see that the piece defends a square or another piece, and only later notice that it really doesn't, since it's pinned. Ideally, the defence should not be seen at all. But I am not sure if it's possible to reach that level, even after a great deal of practice.

To keep Black's king out, White must be able to answer ... cj;lf4 with cj;le2, and ... cj;lg4 with cj;le3. White can reach these squares (e2 and e3) from d2. Black, on the other hand, have two connected squares - f5 and gS. When Black enters a square, White must also enter a square, etc. All Black has to do, to put White in zugzwang, is to go from f5 to gS or vice versa. Chapter 6 - The Woodpecker Method

When I analyse a game with a friend, sometimes we reach a point where we can't avoid smiling - I enjoy all of chess but some positions are more beautiful than others. For me, beauty in chess is when something unfamiliar works; moves that I normally wouldn't even consider, or positions that I automatically evaluate as unplayable. I like when intuition barks up the wrong tree. This is actually just further proof of how much impact "the chess module" has. I am proud when I occasionally spot a mistake in the module. Zugzwang is a theme that's often surprising if there are a few pieces on the board.

34. ..
g4! This is a good positional move, and it also puts White in zugzwang. a) 35.mfl l'!xb5! 36.l'!xb5 i.d3t is the reason White's king can't move. b) 35.i.fl l'!bl 36.l'!c3 gives Black the option to play ... l'!b l-dlxd4. c) 35.h4 is not a move White wants to play. After 35 ... f5! Black continues with ...mh?, ... l'!b8 and ...g7-g5 to open the h-file for the rook. The attack will be decisive. d) 35.h3 f5! leads to a similar attack. It's even more counterintuitive and beautiful if a zugzwang position arises with the queens on the board.

White is in zugzwang! Instead Semcesen played 53 ...h2 and after 54J!h7, the position is surprisingly only a draw.
[diagram]
a) The game continued 54 ... Ei:fl 55.tt:lxg4 h l =W 56.Ei:xhl Ei:xhl 57.tt:le5 and White didn't have any problems holding a draw. b) 54 ... i.h3 55.Ei:g7t is also not good enough for Black. The king has no good square, so Black has to try 55 ... Ei:g4 56.tt:lxg4 i.xg4
57.Ei:h7.

Now there are a couple of tries: bl) The direct 57 ... i.h3 58.Ei:g7t i>h4 looks like a good start, but 59.i>f4! h l =W 60.Ei:h7# isn't a good finish. b2) 57. .. 'tt> g2 threatens ... i.h3. After 58.Ei:xh2t! 'tt> xh2 59.c4! White will either manage to exchange all Black's pawns, or leave him with only one or two rook pawns and a wrong coloured bishop. Let's go back to the position after 53 ...a5 and analyse all White's moves, to check whether he is in zugzwang.
[diagram]
There are quite a few moves to consider: a) If White moves the king, there follows
54.'tt>
d2 h2 55.Ei:h7 i.h3 56.Ei:g7t and Black's king suddenly has an escape square on f2, promoting next move. b) Knight moves allow a check on f3, followed by ...h3-h2. c) After 54.Ei:g5 h2, the rookcan'treach theh-file. d) 54.Ei:g6 h2 55.Ei:h6 i.h3 56.Ei:g6t Ei:g4

I thought the position was easily winning after 60 ...Bd7! since White can't exchange the last pawn, but the Norwegian IM Geir Sune Tallaksen 0stmoe had his doubts and analysed further. After long analysis, I am finally convinced Black will win eventually. I shall omit the analysis as it is not relevant to my main point. To figure out all the hidden tactics in this multiple zugzwang position gave me a lot of joy, and it doesn't concern me that the position is not a simple win at the end. What a fantastic game chess is! Tallaksen 0stmoe became inspired when he saw this game and created a beautiful study. His creation is even better - reciprocal zugzwang but anyhow it's something special that such a position really appeared in a game. Tallaksen 2013

Chapter 6 - The Woodpecker Method 257 SummaryofTactical Motifs Congratulations if you have read this far! One of the previous examples (Exercise 29 on page 243) illustrates why it's useful to know the tactical motifs by heart.
[diagram]
When I have used this exercise in training sessions, a vast majority of the students have "solved" it with I .d5, only to discover that their pin was transformed into a nasty discovered attack. However, that's often the case if the two distant pieces can move in the same direction. That's easier to see if you are well acquainted with the tactical motifs. Threats I ) Shutting in 2) Magnet 3) Removing the defender 4) Opening files, ranks or diagonals 5) Gain of tempo Other motifs I ) Pawn promotion 2) Stalemate 3) Zugzwang Double threats I ) Fork 2) Discovered attack 3) Pin Defences I) Counter-threat 2) Lifeline A final example As the name reveals, there are usually many tactical motifs involved in a combination. This has also been the case in most of the examples above. However, we have seen nothing like the following game. The first moves may not be so difficult, but there will follow a few beautiful and surprising moves later in the line. The solution includes more than half of the tactical motifs. Many of them several times, but I will only mention each once. White is to move. To practise decision making, don't use more than 20 minutes.

This time, there is no doubt that White will win with the queen against two rooks. A position is seldom so rich - almost all of the tactical motifs at once! There is little doubt that knowing the tactical motifs helps to see themes faster. The next step, when following The Woodpecker Method, is to find a puzzle book with quite simple exercises, and solve them over and over again. Tactical exercises The final part of this chapter consists of fifteen complicated exercises. They are some of my favourites, so handle them with care! The exercises will highlight many of the techniques that were discussed in Chapter 4, about calculation. It must be said that some of the exercises are quite difficult, but they are not impossible. Give yourself a maximum of 45 minutes for each batch of three exercises 37-39, 40-42, 43-45, 46-48 and 49-5 1 - so 5 sessions, each no longer than 45 minutes. (This time limit is still designed for a player with a rating of about 2300, so feel free to change it if necessary.) Remember the rules from the beginning of the chapter: 1) You have to solve them in order. 2) You have to choose a move even if you don't think you have found the solution. (If you remember what I wrote in the beginning of the chapter, some of them might not even have a solution!) 3) You have to decide on a move in all the exercises before your 'flag' has fallen. Otherwise, you lose on time. The third block (numbers 43-45) has pawn endings as a theme. They are ideal when practising the skill of accurately calculating long lines. There is a rumour that the Swedish Grandmaster Tiger Hillarp spent a year on the Faroe Islands, only examining pawn endgames - this is too appealing to check if it's true! Good luck!

Danish Team Championship, Copenhagen 20 1 0 Black is threatening 2 5. .. ttld6, winning a piece. White can't move the rook due to 25 ... ttlxg3, so he should defend the rook or move the queen from the discovered attack or move the bishop. Plausible candidate moves are 25.'1&d1,
25.'\Nf3, 25. .ld3, 25.Bb3 and 25.ttlf3. When
looking for candidate moves, hopefully the idea of attacking Black's king with 25 . .lxf7t also enters your mind. Since it's the most forcing option, it's the move to start calculating. 25 . .bf/t!
25.ttlf3 was played in the game.
25 ...�xf7 26.'�c4t This is White's idea, which stops Black's king from going back to g8. 26 ...�£6 Black's king is in danger but how to continue the attack? A check with the queen on the f-file seems devastating. Both 27.'1&b3 and 27.'1&d3 threaten such a check, but the latter seems better since it also threatens the knight.

Intuition can easily exclude such a move automatically, since it loses a pawn close to the king with check. Such intuition has to be questioned.

is a theoretical draw, but there is no reason to enter it. It was important to move the king to c8; with the king on a8 or c6, Black would win by checking on g2, and with the king on a7 and c7, White doesn't have Wfa7xg7. 37• • • £5 It's White's turn to choose which pawn to promote. It's seems that it's faster to go with the a-pawn, since it would also stop Black from promoting with check. However, the queen must go to b8 anyway, to defend the pawn on h2. Thus both options are equal in terms of tempos. The difference is the pawn that is left. I would prefer to leave the a-pawn, since it has advanced furthest.

44. Joakim Morling - Nils-Olof Gottfries
Mragel Open, Lund 1 8th April 20 1 0 When I first saw this position, I thought that White was winning with his distant passed pawn on the a-file. After looking more closely, it becomes clearer that it's not so easy for White to open an entry route on the kingside. In fact, with precise play, Black is winning!

There is a common opinion that most chess players spend too much time studying openings. In one way I agree. Opening studies can never replace solving exercises or analysing your own games, and anyone who creates a List of Mistakes will probably get a hint that the opening is not the phase where most games are decided. Still, studying openings is much more purposeful than many other training methods, if done in the right way. I think there are two reasons many players spend a lot of time studying openings. The choice of openings provides a sort of identity in the chess world; I talk about "my openings" but never about "my endgames". We sometimes identifY a chess player as, for example, "The French Player". With the opening so closely attached to who we are, it's natural that we want to know it well, and this phenomenon also makes it harder to switch to new openings. The second reason is the easiness of getting started. A training partner is necessary to analyse games we have played, and full focus is required when solving combinations. To learn openings, it's enough to turn on a DVD, or pick up a book and start reading. A board and pieces aren't needed. Neither is thinking! This is not the way to study openings! It must be done with the same level of active work as all serious chess training. Chapter overview The subject of this chapter is all parts of opening preparations, in the following order: 1) Level of ambition Openings are a challenge for the chess player, but they can be a rewarding challenge. I have listed five levels of ambition, and even the first is quite ambitious. The content in the chapter is the most difficult in the book, but I hope I have managed to explain it in an understandable way. 2) Databases To work with openings, you need several different databases. 3) Opening files After having chosen an opening and found a good book, it's time to type in the lines in an "opening file" in ChessBase. This is the foundation for future analysis, and makes it easier to check the lines against other sources. 4) Analysing I mention four important principles when analysing with an engine. The idea behind all of them is to make the analysis as human as possible. 5) Incorporating the analysis When the analysis is saved in the opening file, it's easy to lose sight of what's happening. For that reason, there are three principles that will ensure the opening file is easy to survey. Chapter 7 - Openings 28 1 6) Your move It's time for an exercise - a specific opening position where your task is to analyse and create an opening file. 7) Remembering Having finished with the analysis, it's time to discuss the preparations, where remembering variations is an important part. 8) Preparing The topics in this section are: getting as much information as possible, deciding what to play and rehearsing the lines. Finally, there is an example of Nils Grandelius's preparations. Briefly, 1-3 concerns the opening files, 4-6 the analysis and 7-8 the preparations. When I was thirteen I wrote down my complete repertoire in Microsoft Excel, in some sort of opening tree. How life changed when I found ChessBase! Most chess players have chosen that program, and it feels natural to refer to it. To avoid making this chapter into a technical manual, I have added two references: When there is a sign with [A] , instructions are found in the appendix at the end of the book on page 367. The chapter is not about openings, it is about studying them. At the same time, it's good to have an example. That will be the Anti-Slav line starting with: l.�f3 d5 2.g3 �f6 3 • .Bg2 c6

Levels of ambition In his book Profession: Chessplayer Vladimir Tukmakov argues that it's most important to learn standard positions by playing through illustrative games. He is not alone, but the approach I propose in this chapter is based heavily on concrete analysis and thus is fundamentally different. With my approach, you can still learn typical middlegame positions in a satisfying way. There is a similar clash of approaches between learning just one opening very well or playing many different openings. I advocate the latter. It makes it possible to choose an opening based on the opponent's strength, time management and style of play. At the same time, the opponent can barely prepare at all. However, my most important argument for playing many openings is that it's a good way to learn about all kinds of positions. I know there are disadvantages with my approach. One, which I don't consider too serious, is that you get very dependent on preparations. If you play many different lines, you have to refresh your memory before every game. In rapid tournaments, that's often not possible. In the 20 1 2 Swedish Championship, I played different openings in all nine games and managed to stay undefeated and shared first to fourth place. The tiebreak was decided by rapid games,

where there was no time for real preparations. I had opening catastrophes in the two first games and didn't stand a chance. Another disadvantage is of course that you need to continue working, to keep all the openings under control. It's a common trait among humans to believe that there will be a lot of free time in the future. The near future is filled with obligatory things, but later, there will be more freedom. When we reach "later", things have changed ... Ifwe want to play several openings, and do it well, we have to find that time now. This chapter will be useful even for players who have less time or less interest in working on their openings. The analysis can still be made in the same way, the preparations are similar and I think it will be useful for everyone to work with "opening files", even if they are small ones. Below, I list five possible levels of opening ambitions. I) Creating some "opening files" in ChessBase. The first moves in your previous games are saved in the files, to know how to play if an opponent repeats what you have played earlier. 2) Trying to get a repertoire that covers most of the openings you play, and checking the common moves among top players in the Reference database. 3) Doing some analysis ofyour own, to have some ideas that will surprise opponents. It's especially important to deviate from the games you have in the TWIC-database. 4) Checking the opening files against new books, to catch out players who follow these books. Looking for novelties everywhere, to surprise any opponent. 5) Trying to build comprehensive opening files so that you seldom need to analyse during a tournament. There is nothing wrong with having even lower ambitions than the first level, but for the purpose of this chapter, it's best to start there. I think very few 2400-players reach level two or three, and reaching the final step might just be a dream for most. For example, it's regularly possible to read about Super-GMs who, fifteen minutes before the round, find out that their line is unplayable. Still, I believe it's helpful to have defined those levels. Nils Grandelius and I started to train together when he was twelve. I was seven years older, but he was already higher rated. Two years later, in April 2008, I gave him the task of creating a small opening file for the Berlin with 4.d3 Bc5 5.Bxc6, a variation where understanding is much more important than concrete analysis. Before he showed me the opening file, he played it against me and got an advantage! At that time he was still a child and didn't really work on chess on his own. I know my memories are rose-tinted, but just two years later I think he had reached the final level on the list above. Chapter 7 - Openings 283 Since then, he has built one of the most feared opening repertoires in Sweden. The good news is that Grandelius is still following all of the principles in this chapter. Opening files In addition to a database with your own games, and one to search for games of opponents, it's good to have a working database, a database with top-level games and, of course, opening databases. I have written about them in the appendix at the end of the chapter. An opening file is like a small opening book. A justified question is therefore: isn't it just easier to use a real book? The logistical problem of travelling to tournaments with a backpack filled with opening books is solvable, but the most important reason to save openings in a database is the possibility to personalize it. You can promote lines you are planning to play, it's possible to analyse new moves and to add personal remarks. The following steps summarize the process of creating an opening file. My analysis of the illustrative line, the Anti-Slav variation starting with J.t;)f3 d5 2.g3 t;)f6 3 • .Bg2 c6 4.c4 dxc4, mostly stems from January 20 10, when I was the second for Grandelius in Wijk aan Zee. 1) Choose a good opening Dubious lines may work from time to time, but in the long run it's best for your chess development to play what the grandmasters play. I guess no one has heard of a junior soccer team playing 4-2-4. It may very well give good results in beginner's soccer, when they haven't the skill to use the midfield to build up the play, but somehow it's against the spirit of the game. To start with lLlf3, g2-g3, i.g2 and O-O looks quite harmless, which it really is if White continues with d2-d3 in King's Indian fashion. It's more active, and better, to follow up with c2-c4 and d2- d4, with the idea of transposing into a Catalan structure. So why not start with l .d4 and meet the Queen's Gambit with the Catalan? There are three reasons to start by fianchettoing and castling, then only afterwards pushing d2-d4. 1) It avoids ... i.b4(t) This bishop move is played in many lines of the Catalan, the Bogo-Indian and not least in the Nimzo-lndian. 2) It avoids an early ... dxc4 This is also a common theme for Black in the Slav, Open Catalan, Queen's Gambit Accepted and also the Griinfeld. 3) It avoids an early ... cxd4 In many openings Black "threatens" ... cxd4 and forces White to push d4-d5. This happens in the Benko Gambit and in all the Benoni lines.

That was a lot of openings avoided! The Tarrasch is still available in its pure form, likewise the Closed Catalan. Against the King's Indian and Dutch, White can choose whether he wants to transpose to normal lines or play some 'Anti-System'. Basically, White plays a 'Griinfeld Indian Attack', which is best seen in the line 1.�6 d5 2.g3 c5
3.Ag2 �c6 4.d4. The extra tempo gives White a nice position, and unprepared opponents often
find themselves unpleasantly surprised by 4.d4. Of course, Black also gets some extra possibilities, mainly the Symmetrical English, with the Hedgehog or other setups. What is most usual, though, is that Black plays some sort of Anti Catalan (1.�6 d5 2.g3 �f6 3 . .Bg2 e6 4.c4 dxc4) or Anti-Slav (1.�6 d5 2.g3 �f6 3.Ag2 c6
4.c4 dxc4). The last line is the example in this chapter.
Teimour Radjabov is one top grandmaster who has used the move order starting with I .liJf3 and
2.g3. It's definitively a serious try.
2) Finding a book or a DVD It is possible but rather impractical to reinvent the wheel - so a good book is an excellent first source to learn from. When I studied the Anti-Slav in Mostar, from August to September 2008, I only knew a few books mentioning the move order. A few years later a magnificent work by Mihail Marin appeared. The book you choose should teach the most important positional ideas. The main characteristic for the Anti-Slav variation is the fianchettoed bishop. There are many reasons why it's so strong: A It defends the king. White always castles short in the Anti-Slav. A It controls a long diagonal. White would love to exchange his c- and d-pawns for Black's c- and d-pawns to open up the diagonal. A It's difficult to threaten the bishop with a knight. In the Anti-Slav, White often gets the bishop pair. Many endgames are thus good for White, since the bishop pair shows its full strength there. There are also some downsides with fianchettoed bishops: A If the bishop is exchanged, the king becomes weak. In the Anti-Slav, Black plays an early ... c6, and will thus probably not castle long. Therefore, White doesn't have to be afraid of an attack on his king. A A pawn must be moved to develop the bishop to g2. I think this is the main disadvantage. l .e4 is also a pawn move that opens up the bishop, but in addition it controls the centre;
2.g3 does not.
A The bishop also loses control over the c4-square, which allows Black to try 4 ...dxc4. In the long run, the bishop has great influence over the centre from its fianchettoed position, but in the first moves, Black gets some extra possibilities. Chapter 7 - Openings 285 Emil Hermansson, Nils Grandelius's first trainer, emphasized that it's important to understand the logic behind the first moves. Before studying the sharp variations of the Sicilian Najdorf, one has to know why Black plays moves like 2 ...d6 and 5 ...a6. To follow his advice, I will give some annotations of the first four moves. t.�a White develops the knight, prepares to castle short and stops Black from playing l ...e5. l.. . d5 Black occupies the centre with a pawn, in the only possible way.
2.g3
White chooses to play with a fianchettoed bishop, with the pluses and minuses that were discussed above.
[diagram]
Again, the most logical move, developing the knight to its most active square. 3 . .Bg2 c6 This is a mysterious move. It doesn't develop a piece, occupy the centre or prepare castling. Black's thought processes can be summarized in the following five steps: 1) I don't want to fianchetto my king's bishop, so I have to move the e-pawn to develop it. (What a boring player!) 2) For the moment I can't play 3 ...e5. I don't want to prepare it with 3 ... tLlc6 since White answers with 4.d4. In d4-openings, the knight doesn't want to block the c-pawn, neither for White nor for Black. (There are a lot of exceptions, but in general this is a reasonable thought.) 3) I can't see any other good moves preparing ...e5, so later I have to play ...e6. (That's right.) 4) I don't want to leave the bishop on c8 - it seems too passive! (A matter of taste, but there doesn't seem to be anything wrong with this player's taste.) 5) Both f5 and g4 seem to be reasonable squares for the bishop, but can I really weaken b7 so early? I am afraid that White will quickly play moves like c2-c4, Wfb3 and tLlc3. (A fine sense of danger - White really would do this.) 6) Let's start with 3 ... c6. 1t defends the d-pawn. IfWhite castles and I develop the bishop next move, he is one tempo slower if he tries the same queenside pressure. (Nice reasoning - this is a player who knows why he plays his first moves!)
4.c4
The logic behind this move is exactly the same as behind 3 ...c6. White wants to stop Black from developing the c8-bishop by being ready to attack b 7. 4 •. . dxc4 Black is consistent and holds true to his three maxims: No fianchettoed bishop; Do not play ... e6 before the light-squared bishop has developed; Avoid ... .tg4 or ... .tf5 when White has direct pressure against b 7. 4 ...dxc4 takes a pawn and tries to punish White's play. Black will try to hold on to the pawn, since if White recaptures it without making any concessions, he will have a pleasant position with two centre pawns against one. 3) Inputting the chosen lines After you have read the opening book and decided which lines suit you best, it's time to input the moves, evaluations and the valuable

text comments into a game in ChessBase. It's better to write more text than less; text comments make it much easier to remember. Here is one example from the highest possible level. Viswanathan Anand -Veselin Topalov World Championship, Sofia 25th April 20 1 0
[diagram]
In the first game, Anand forgot his preparation and lost. In this second game he was eager to repair the damage. In the diagram position he has sacrificed a pawn, but his better-placed pieces provide compensation. 1 5.tlJce5 was played in Gulko - Shulman, US Championship 2008, but Anand's team had prepared a novelty. I5.'1Wa3?! Voluntarily accepting doubled pawns! Anand won the game, but he had mixed up his preparation. 1 5.!!fdl l:!e8 1 6.Wfa3 was the actual preparation. Not only is !!fdl a useful move, but it also makes more sense to play Wfa3, exchanging Black's queen and accepting doubled pawns, with the black rook on e8, since White will have tiJd6 with a threat to the rook. If it had been pointed out in the opening file that White plays Wfa3 when Black's rook is on e8, since he has tiJd6 with tempo, I am sure Anand would have remembered it, probably even many decades later. It's a bit extreme to explain every move with text annotations, and too obvious comments don't fill a purpose. However, in the case of move orders, it's often crucial. Here is an example where it would be difficult to remember the move order without understanding it. Example l.d4 d5 2.c4 c6 3.tl.'lf3 �f6 4.�c3 dxc4 5.a4 .i£5 6.tl.'le5 e6 7.£3 .Bb4 s.tl.'lxc4! c5 9.dxc5 Y!fxdlt IO.c;f?xdl O-O 1 1.e4 .Bg6 12.�d6 :Sd8 13.c;f?e1 �M7 14 . .le3 :Sc7

White is temporarily a pawn up, but Black will probably manage to win it back. White's idea is to open up the queenside, since Black's bishop on g6 is completely out of play. Instead of 1 3.<;t>e l , everyone goes to c2, but I think the king is safer on f2. White's first task is to complete development with Be2 and <;t>f2, but in which order? The analysis engines indicate that 1 5.Be2 is best. It would be easy to be satisfied with that, but it would be hard to remember in a game, which might be played several months later. Chapter 7 - Openings 287 It's difficult for humans to remember plain moves, but easy to remember verbal concepts. To add a text comment after 1 5.j,e2, we need to understand why it's better. It turns out that 1 5.'it>f2 can be met with 1 5. .. :1'1xc5!? 16.j,xc5 j,xc5t with check. Black also has 1 5. .. l2:lbd7!?. With 1 5 .j,e2 played, White would have 1 5. .. l2:lbd7?! 1 6.l2:lxb7 j,xc3 1 7.bxc3 l"1xb7 1 8.c6, but with the king on f2, there is 1 8. .. :1'1b2t. Again, a check disturbs the king on f2.
15. .Be2!
In the opening file, the following text can now safely be added: "White wants to develop with j,e2 and �f2, but the latter can be met with 1 5. .. :1'1xc5!? or 1 5. .. l2:lbd7!? 16.l2:lxb7 j,xc3 17.bxc3 l"1xb7 1 8.c6 l"1b2t." I recommend setting the most important move as the mainline when there is a branch. By doing so, the final position becomes some sort of verdict. It's also good to use exclamation and question marks when possible. They are another type of comment that makes it easier to remember. It might also be helpful to use coloured squares and arrows to represent plans and weak squares, but be aware that those can't be seen if the analysis is printed [A] . But, you may ask, in this book's introduction I said many verbal explanations are wrong. Shouldn't the text comments be removed, to avoid the phenomenon of verbal overshadowing? The difference is the aim. In the opening file, the aim is to remember concrete moves. Verbal explanations work well for that purpose. The middlegame skills you learn when analysing should, on the other hand, not be summarized in a few sentences; their essence is better captured by your intuition. 4) Checking the file against played games You should save the openings in your games in the opening file. If possible, you will find a way to deviate, thus avoiding future opponents' preparations. Your games will also make memorization much easier, since they represent episodes and not just facts. For most people, episodes are saved in the right hemisphere, and activating those memories allows you to use the brain's full capacity. It's also good to see what grandmasters are playing, by checking the Reference-database [A] . Theory may have developed since your opening book was published. Cite the relevant games by Super-GMs. 5) Analysing Sometimes the variation in the opening book is clear cut, with an indisputable advantage if you are White, or dead certain equal play if you are playing for equality with Black. Then there is no need to find new moves. But this is not the case in most lines, especially not with White. Actually, that is not surprising, since the game of chess has a rather wide drawing margin. Often, when authors of opening books can't find any advantage, they give a novelty, attach an !? and write that the idea remains to be tested, or that practical examples are needed. I do like the idea of surprising my opponent with a new move, but it loses some impact when published for thousands of readers! It's terrible to follow such a book-line when the opponent is self-confidently blitzing out moves. You know that he has a prepared move somewhere, but you don't know where. In addition, you may not be certain of the quality of the book's analysis. It's much better to prepare a new move of your
288 Pump Up Your Rating
own! If two moves are of equal value, it's better to choose the one that isn't mentioned in the book. Ideas of your own give a competitive advantage over the board, at least on the clock. To deviate from opening books is a most common reason to analyse. A new top game in TWIC that seems to develop the theory is another reason, or when a future opponent has played a move that's not mentioned in the opening file. However, there doesn't have to be a specific reason to start analysing! The next part of the chapter covers the craft of analysis. 6) Comparing with other sources Many players follow specific opening books. To check those books and prepare novelties against them gives an enormous advantage in tournament games. The bad news is that theory continues to develop, and new opening books appear. A serious player needs to keep up to date. It's also good to check the opening file against new TWIC-games in the Reference-database from time to time. How often depends on the opening; in fashionable lines, one tournament can completely alter the existing theory, but in others, not much has happened during the last century. An opening file When I thought I understood the concept of the Ami-Slav, I made an opening file. There was no book on this line, so the main source, except my analysis, was grandmaster games. In the following months I updated the file when a relevant new top-level game appeared or when I had played a game. Below is what the opening file looked like. Since I share my opening files with friends, I have always tried to write so that others could understand my files. Anti-Slav 4 ... dxc4 5.O-O l.c!LJB d5 2.g3 c!Llf6 3 • .Bg2 c6 A useful semi-waiting move. Black wants to develop the bishop to g4, but 3 ... .Bg4 4.c4 c6

5.O-O is the main move according to the
Reference-database, but Openings for Black according to Karpov doesn't mention it. That's good! If White manages to pick up the c4- pawn, he will have a healthy advantage with an extra centre pawn.

So this was my opening file in early 20 1 0, excluding the analysis of the main tabiya after 1 l .E:e 1 , which is found later in the chapter. Later, I read Marin's book and found some improvements there. When they were clearly better, or when I already had "my" move in the TWIC-database, I changed to Marin's line. If the moves were of equal value, I didn't choose Marin's move, since a new move gives more surprise value. Summary It's good to save the repertoire in opening files. It makes it easier to get an overview over the repertoire and to analyse critical positions. The first step is to choose a good opening and a good book. Especially, you should examine the first moves very carefully! Type the lines that you plan to play into ChessBase. This might be enough even for an ambitious player. The next step is to search for fresh, relevant games, and if possible, also check new opening books. Analyse the critical positions - it's always good to have ideas of your own to surprise your opponents. Structure of the databases If all the analysis is saved in one single game file, it's almost impossible to get an overview. It's better to divide your analysis in a lot of different databases and games, and have one database per opening, like in Figure 1 . I have given them flags mainly because I like colours. In the database, every game represents one opening variation. Related variations are placed beside each other, and empty games and headers are used to get an easy overview, like in Figure 2 [A] . !CBerlin atalan

VCs A30 res A30 vcs A30 To be able to survey the opening file easily, I think 200 to 500 half moves is ideal. If a game gets too big, it is better split in two [A] . position you like, although unclear or equal, or to force the opponent to find a lot of difficult moves before he reaches equality. If the line is many moves away from existing theory, there is a great probability that he won't find the best moves over the board. And if he steers his way through the minefield, he will at least be far behind on the clock. Analysing The following section will discuss how to analyse with an engine. To illustrate, I'll give examples from the critical position in the Anti-Slav. The examples are all put together in the end of the section, creating the complete opening file. The first step is setting a goal, normally to get an advantage with White or equality with Black. However, other factors can also be included, like getting positions with a lot of play or getting sterile positions. It depends on what type of opponent the opening is prepared for. If it isn't possible to find an advantage with White, which is often the case, you have to change the goal. It might be either to get a I really believe in the latter approach, which might be called "One-Game-Preparations". If I have played a novelty and the game has been published in the TWIC-database, it's often time to change. The secret is always finding new variations. The main line of the Anti-Slav is an example of a One-Game-Preparation.

2l.�xh6t B!g7 For the last nine moves, Black's alternatives were much weaker. In many cases they were even plain lost. Since l l .:Rel is a novelty, it seems very improbable that Black would find all these moves over the board. A draw is probably okay against such a player! If there is a desperate need for a win, it's possible to play on with 22.d4 - White is slightly worse.
13.lt:lxc6 only leads to a draw. I am convinced
that it's a good practical decision to play it, but when I have played it once, I have to find another line. The technical part of the analysis is not exciting: it's good to have a strong engine, a powerful processor and a fast hard drive. The capacity is also increased by closing other programs on the computer and not letting the engine show too many moves in ChessBase [A] . The effect of the latter is marginal, but I prefer showing three moves. What's interesting in the process is not the computer's role, but instead the creative part. To leave the computer thinking might work to find a good move, but that's not the point. The point is to work actively. The Woodpecker Method (Chapter 6) is partly based on the human's ability to recognize patterns we have seen before. We don't remember the tactics consciously, but they appear automatically when we see a similar position. If you work actively on an opening with an engine, you will see common tactical tricks Chapter 7 - Openings 297 and standard moves, many more than if you only read a book. All the moves will not make it into the opening file, but your intuition will definitely improve. Pattern recognition is one of the main advantages given by analysing openings; you improve your understanding for the middlegame positions. But this is lost if a friend or a coach prepares the openings for you. However, analysing openings gets even better with a training partner. Having two people makes it possible to discuss ideas and assessments, and helps to develop positional understanding. So analysing openings is definitely a rewarding training method, if done in an active way. Analyse like in a game Start by analysing the move that seems strongest or most natural. In that way, you avoid spending unnecessary time analysing options that will be rejected anyway. However, there is still a need to look for candidate moves, if not every move. In a way, there is actually not much difference between analysing with a computer and thinking during a game. But it's easier, since there's no need to spend much time on the calculations. There are four important pieces of advice that will strengthen the similarities. Analyse normal moves To start with, it's of course necessary to see the critical lines to know if the opening variation is worth working on. However, a human opponent in a game will most likely play human moves. Hence, it's important to have analysed those and not just the engine's first choice. (But most often, they coincide.) When considering your own moves, it might be good to choose the best ones, but when analysing the opponent's possibilities, it's better to ask: "What do I think he will play in this position?" Let's see the position after l l.�el in the Anti-Slav. Analysis of the critical position - second example I.c!Llf3 d5 2.g3 c!Llf6 3 • .Bg2 c6 4.c4! dxc4

Black is a pawn up, but several moves behind in development. Which are his most natural moves? I would say there are three possibilities: 1 1 . ..e6, developing the bishop, 1 1 . ..h6, forcing the active knight back, or 1 l ...ttJbd5, blocking the diagonal ofWhite's fianchettoed bishop. The engine adds other moves. It suggests 1 l ...ttJbd7 and 1 1 ...'1Mfc7. However, it's dangerous to only look at the engine. By doing so, 1 1 .. .e6 would be completely overlooked!

If the position after 1 IJ�el is reached against an unprepared opponent, I think 1 1 .. .e6 is quite probable. It would be a pity to miss the forced win! Make your own evaluations When a position appears over the board, it doesn't matter if the engine indicates +0.27 if you don't understand why. The computer can't help you to find the continuation during the game! Hence, you must in person make the evaluations at the end of the lines. If this evaluation differs from the engine's, you have to find out why. Not only humans, but also engines can misevaluate positions. The moves you consider logical are tested against the engine's moves. And tested again. And again. At the end, there might still be some confusion, but the feeling is probably that your positional understanding has been improved. Or in some rare moments of happiness - that your evaluation was superior to the engine's. When I am not sure how to assess a position, I write my questions in the opening file and use the first chance to ask another player. I will now show two examples where it's important to make your own evaluation. Analysis of the critical position - third example I.tLlf3 d5 2.g3 tLlf6 3 . .Bg2 c6 4.c4! dxc4

It is time to assess the position, but not with an engine. Instead, the question to ask is: "What do I think about this position? Is it something I want to play in a game?'' White is an exchange down but has three extra pawns. Normally, this is very good, but there are some things to worry about. White's extra Chapter 7 - Openings 299 pawns are not the best - three pawn islands and only one passed pawn. Black controls the only open file and if he manages to exchange rooks, he may attack the queenside pawns.

According to the engine, White is slightly better. I am not certain of that evaluation - Black seems to have a lot of potential if he manages to regroup and use both rooks. I can't see any clear way to attack the king, or to use either of the two extra pawns. It's difficult to analyse further. If I choose 20.Bg2, I get a position I don't really like, where I have to continue playing on my own. Let's try 20.Bxa8. Before continuing with that move, I want to mention the most important method of analysing. The x-technique When an analysis engine is running in ChessBase, it's possible to press "x" to give the move to the opponent. The idea is to check whether there is a threat in the position; knowing that makes it much easier to assess the position. Quite often, it happens that there is a threat, but you don't understand why it wasn't possible already one move earlier. In that case, it's a good idea to go back and check that line. Type in a null-move for one of the players and try executing the threat [A] . The method is explained in detail below. To me, there is no doubt that the x-technique is the most useful analysing method.

The engine gives many moves for White, all with some initiative. When I saw that one of the first was 23.h3, I became curious. Why is that a good move?
23.h3
I played the move and pressed "x". The engine claimed that White should play 24.1'!c3 with +0.80. So why not play 1'!c3 one move earlier? I went back, tried it and saw that 23 ...e5 was Black's best reply. So what happens after 23.h3! -- 24.1'!c3 e5? To see that, you have to enter a null-move (Ctrl+Alt+O). After going back and forth a few times, it's possible to see why h2-h3 helps. The main difference arises after: 23.1'!c3 e5 24.Aa3t <it>d8

With h2-h3 played, White would have a safe square for the king on h2. Without h2- h3, there either follows a queen exchange after
30.<it>h3 or counterplay after 30.f3 e4.
In the end, I wrote down a brief conclusion in the opening file. For example: "Gives the king an escape square much later. White threatens 1'!c3-d3 now." b2) 22 •• • Yfb8 23J�c6 Threatening \Re4, winning (I pressed x to learn that). 23 • • • t!e5 24 • .Bxe5 Yfxe5 25.Elc8 Threatening mate in two. 25 • • • 5

This position leads to the next section. Is it time to stop or should you analyse a few moves deeper? Stopping when the branches get too big The aim with calculation is to find a way through the tactics, then assess the position only when it's of a positional nature. Analysis has the same aim. The engine is used when there are tactical possibilities. When the position has calmed down, it's possible to make a human assessment. Unfortunately there are often new tactics appearing all the time. For that reason, it's difficult to know when to stop. When the difference between the best and second best moves is high, it makes sense to continue. However, if several of the opponent's moves are of about equal strength, it's an indication that it's time to stop. Not only does it become much more difficult to analyse further, but it also becomes hard to remember the analysis for use in a later game. Without that, the analysis loses some of its meaning. In the position above, it's time to stop and make an evaluation, since Black has a few moves of about the same strength. The engine gives White a winning advantage. As I can't see how Black could try to develop his bishop and rook, I see no reason to question that. However, I also notice that the engine gives f4- f5 as White's next move. In most cases, I think it's good to end the analysis with a move of your own. When the opponent has made a move, you only need to analyse one move to extend the variation one ply. That is not the case after one of your moves. In summary, the four principles when analysing are:
A.
A.

A.
Analyse normal moves Make your own evaluations Use the x-technique Stop when the branches get too big Chapter 7 - Openings 303 Incorporating the analysis in the opening file Analysing is done directly in the opening file, but it's a creative process and doesn't allow much structure. When finished, the opening file will therefore be quite messy, sometimes without text comments and evaluations. It has to be cleaned up. Having too many moves will ruin the overview and doesn't make anything easy to remember. There are three easy princi ples to follow when polishing the opening file. Annotating all important points with text After an analysis session, you have the important points in your head. Some of them may be forgotten already the next day, and many more after a few months. And even if they are still in your unconscious knowledge, it's better to write them down. In that way, you are reminded of them when you prepare for a game and look through the opening file. The game Anand - Topalov shown in the beginning of the chapter is a good example of the value of text comments. It's also helpful to use exclamation and question marks - such meaningful information is what the memory likes. Removing irrelevant variations Quite often, the analysis stretches too far to be relevant in a practical game. Then it has to be cut down. To make the opening file clearer, it's also good to remove analysed moves that you decided against playing. For such unsuccessful tries, I leave only a short note that explains why they were rejected. If the alternative lines are too good to be thrown away completely and may be worth a further look later on, they can be saved in another file. In the last example, two moves were analysed - 20.J.xa8 and 20.J.g2. I didn't like the latter and see no point in leaving all the analysis in my file. I only leave: "20.i.g2 tLle5 21.V;!fe4 �c8 22.d4 @e7 23.i.a3t @es 24.i.xfs @xm
25.dxe5 f5 I don't like this position."
Ending every line with an evaluation If a prepared position is reached in a game, it helps a lot to know the evaluation - if it's winning, a small advantage or even worse. If you know that a position is winning, it's easier to set high goals when calculating and to reject moves that don't fulfil those aims. As mentioned in the chapter about tactics, I do not recommend using the Process of Elimination when calculating in normal positions, but in a sense, it can be used in positions immediately after your preparation. Here is one example. Analysis of the critical position - fifth example I.tLlf3 d5 2.g3 tLlf6 3.i.g2 c6 4.c4! dxc4

It's much easier to find the correct line with the knowledge that White is winning. White is a rook down, so there must be something brutal! It's thus reasonable to avoid considering a calm move like 19.a3. The bishop is trapped, but it's not possible to capture it on the next move. My intuition tells me that this is not "a winning move".

Black is helpless. The three principles when cleaning up the analysis are: All important points are annotated with text Irrelevant variations are removed Every line ends with an evaluation Chapter 7 - Openings 305 Summary Start by setting a goal. It may be getting an advantage or forcing the opponent to find some difficult moves. Analyse the position like in a normal game. 1) Look for human candidate moves and start by analysing the one that seems strongest. 2) Use the x-technique to see threats for both sides. 3) Stop when there are too many moves of about the same value. 4) End with a move of your own and make a human evaluation. 5) However, mark it with an Informant symbol (;!; or ± and so on) in most cases, but comment upon all important points with text. 6) The goal is to make the opening file as easy to survey as possible. For that reason, remove irrelevant variations. They impair readability. Finally - Ta-da! Here is the final opening file for the critical position of the Anti-Slav variation.

Black has coordination problems. Overall, I think the secret is not being satisfied with a move like 14.'1Mfc3. White did not play the knight to e2 to exchange queens, but to challenge the knight on h5. The engine doesn't take long to point out that 1 5.lLlxh5 is bad. I instead concentrated on 1 5 .lLlc6 for some time before I tested sacrificing the piece. I sacrificed simply because I was curious to know the knight's answer to my question! Quite soon, it was clear that White had interesting compensation. One of my students left his engine running in the position after 14 ...e5 while he went skiing. The piece sacrifice was proposed when he came back. It seems that the engine starts to understand something when it has reached depth 23. However, it's not possible to go skiing between every move! Computers are rapidly getting better, and I guess the engine will soon spot the solution without needing much time. Even so, I must again emphasize that the working process is at least as important as the resulting moves. I analysed the variation above at Wijk aan Zee in January 20 1 0. Over three years later I still have not had the chance to play the sacrifice. The position after 14 ...e5 has been reached five times over the board without anyone playing 1 5.<;t>b l !!. I later learned it had been played in 2009 in a correspondence game Florea - Chiricuta. In the sharpest lines, it pays to keep an eye on the games of the top correspondence players. Remembering It is tiresome to hear many chess players complaining about their weak memories. There is nothing strange about forgetting your preparation one time or another. Everyone does. I rather think it's impressive that many remember dozens and dozens of moves, while barely trying! Chapter 7 - Openings 3 1 7 When learning a language, it's said that a word has to be rehearsed between 50 and 1 00 times to be learned by heart. Before school exams, students check if they know the words time after time. When studying openings, the lines are usually rehearsed just a few times. Often, it's even done in a passive way. With such an attitude, it's not surprising if your memory works worse than it used to before exams. Passive and active memory are two different things - recognizing something and recalling it. In chess games, the two memories are combined. The next moves need not be remembered until the position is on the board, but by then you have no further hints. You practise the passive memory when you click through the opening. Instead, I think it's important to recall the moves while preparing. This is done most easily with the Training function in ChessBase [A] . Also remember to see the board from the same side as in the upcoming game. Personally, I like to print out my opening files and study them on a real board. We remember things from each of the five senses, and it's thus much easier to remember a phenomenon that includes several of them. Chess moves seldom have a specific taste or smell, so those options fall away. Nevertheless, the view of the board can be combined with the sense of moving the piece, and even speaking it out loud or quietly in your head. If a computer is used, I strongly recommend making the moves with the mouse. There is a greater risk of forgetting if you are lazy and just use the right-arrow on the keyboard - if you do that, then it is the computer that is remembering the moves; you are just pressing buttons. The human memory is much better at storing verbal concepts than pure facts, so it's important to think why the moves are played. Repetition may be the mother of all knowledge, but only if it's done in the right way. Chess players often rehearse opening moves while preparing for games, but the process can be made much more systematic than that. Let's say that a new opening is analysed, and an opening file is created. The first repetition takes place already when the file is cleaned up afterwards. According to memory scientists, repetitions should then be made after one day, one week, one month and six months. Most of those repetitions come naturally when preparing for games at tournaments, but I think it would be time well-invested to use some hours to play through the opening files one day and one week after they are created. Before a tournament, it may be useful to think about the choice of openings. If some special openings are planned, it's good to use one day to rehearse them. It also gives the mind some time to adapt to the style of play. Most chess players can be proud of their memory, even if they complain about it. But rehearsing in a more structured way would get even better results. Having a specialized memory is probably quite usual when a lot of time is spent on an activity, and there are some remarkable examples. One evening, a bridge player in Australia noticed that he had exactly the same cards as in a competition two years earlier. He concluded that the organizers had used the same pairing key as back then. He could not only tell all his upcoming cards, but also all the cards of his partners for the rest of the evening! The story ended surprisingly: he was disqualified and thus punished for his strong memory. 3 1 8 Pump Up Your Rating Preparing Gettin g as much information as possible In principle, it is good to get as much information as possible about your opponent and the opening you will play against him, while he gets as little information as possible. However, this advice can be interpreted in more or less strict ways. I am an addict regarding preparation. In rapid tournaments, with only short pauses between the rounds, I prepare in advance for all the top players with both colours. That is nothing compared to what I do in the Swedish League. There it's possible to rotate the team setup, which sometimes gives seven possible opponents. While most players feel that it's too much to prepare for everyone, I see my chance. I start by checking the games in my main database, which I call Gigabase, but nowadays there are sometimes additional games at http://ratings.fide.com. I also have another secret method to find games: the ICC. Many people play under their real names, and it's possible to search for a player (tell findname name Axel Smith) and his relevant games (search Smith Al l). It can be very useful! Before one of the games in the Swedish League, I found a hole in an opponent's repertoire after seeing his ICC games. I used a few days to study a new opening before that game and was quite optimistic. Sadly, I was paired against one of the other possible opponents. Anyway, my preparations gave satisfYing results. That season I was on average 30 minutes up on the clock after the opening. However, I must also mention what many friends tell me: that I focus too much on opening preparation. One time, when I was at an airport on the way to a round robin rapid tournament, I suddenly found the starting list of 32 players. I immediately started preparing with both colours against all the players, but it took more time than expected and I was 45 minutes late for the flight. In that case I will admit I focused too much on my preparations, but in general I don't think it's a problem for me. It's important, though, to feel that the preparations aren't taking energy away from the game. By the way, the flight was miraculously waiting for me, and I earned back the minutes lost during the opening phases in the games in the tournament! Deciding which opening to play By having more than one opening in your repertoire, it's possible to make a targeted preparation. It's even easier if the opponent consistently plays the same openings. Start by picking the most recent games with the relevant colour [A] . Sometimes that means one year and sometimes the last 1 5 games; that is only a preference. Instead of checking all games one by one, it's easier to create an "opening book" in ChessBase [A] . The relevant question is of course which openings the opponent seems to play well and which he seems to play less well. Do you know how to play against his favourite lines? Personally, I don't want to spend energy during a tournament analysing opening lines, so if he plays something I am unfamiliar with, I'd rather go for another opening. Chapter 7 - Openings 3 1 9 However, there are also a lot o fother things to consider when choosing what to play: J..If you play a higher-rated opponent, and neither of you has any clear weak points in your repertoire, it's good to play an opening with a lot of theory. That increases the chance that the game will be decided in the opening phase, or that there is not much play left when the opening phase is over. J..With the same reasoning, it's better to choose openings with more positional decisions against lower-rated opponents. The idea is that playing strength will have a greater influence. J..Choose openings with few theoretical moves against time trouble addicts, so they start to spend their time early in the game. J..Opponents with an active playing style might dislike solid openings, and vice versa. Of course, such considerations must be weighed against the risk of choosing something that doesn't suit you! J..It may also be helpful to check the opponent's games with reversed colours. Does he play the opening you have planned to play against him? It also shows what type of positions he has experience with. It's good to find what he enjoys least. One last piece of advice is very important - imagine the opponent's situation. What information does he have? It's important to know which of your own games have been published in TWIC, especially when you get surprised. In such situations, it's generally good to deviate as early as possible. With all information in hand, the opening choice usually makes itself Personally, I try to decide which opening to play the evening before the game. It gives something interesting to think about when trying to sleep ... but also reduces stress and gives a feeling of how much time the preparations will take. Rehearsing the lines Finally, I check all of my opponent's games (I have not played Victor Korchnoi yet, who has 5000 games) and make a list of the openings I have to rehearse. I prefer to save the list in a game in ChessBase, since it makes it easy to retrieve the preparations for the next game against the same opponent. If the opponent has played something that isn't mentioned in the book or in the opening file, it has to be analysed. This should be done before rehearsing lines, since the final evaluation of the analysis may change the opening choice. If there is nothing to analyse, it's time to start going through the opening files and rehearsing the moves. Actively - not in bed! I prefer doing this only on the morning before the game, so my memory keeps the variations fresher in my mind. Start with the most probable opening; something may happen that makes it impossible to rehearse every line. However, starting with the most probable opening may also give a chance to check that opening file for a second time. Personally, I usually spend about three hours to rehearse 3000 half-moves. My memory is easily disturbed, so I try to avoid thinking of other things after the end of my preparations until the opening phase is over.

Some players think that it's bad to play fast in the opening, since it reveals what's prepared. However, a friend of mine does the opposite: he plays fast when he is out of book, to trick the opponent into thinking it is still preparation. There are already two ways to interpret slow play (prepared or not prepared) and fast play (prepared or not prepared). So I think it's better not to bother trying time-management tricks in the opening - just play the prepared moves as quickly as possible and save the valuable seconds for later in the game! Below is a checklist for preparing for a game. The time schedule works when the tournament has one game per day, starting in the afternoon, as in most serious tournaments. 1) Create the opening files. Long before the tournament 2) Download the latest TWIC-games and update the The day before the tournament Gigabase. 3) Search for relevant games of the opponent (Gigabase, fide.com, ICC). 4) Make an opening book with his latest games with the relevant colour; maybe 1 5 games or a full year. Check When the pairings are published what openings he plays and think if you would like meeting them. 5) Check your own games and think what he is probably preparing against you. 6) Decide which opening to play. 7) Check more (maybe all) of his games to see whether there are relevant games. Write down a list of lines to The evening before the game prepare and analyse. 8) Analyse, if needed. The final evaluation of the analysis may change the choice of opening. 9) Rehearse the opening files, starting with the most The morning before the game important opening. One example of preparations Below is a summarized excerpt from Nils Grandelius's preparations against the Serbian GM Milos Perunovic (rated 2578). The game was played in the last round of the Bosna Open in May 20 1 1 . 1he games from 2010 and the beginning of 201 1 (30 games) show that he plays at least four diffe rent Sicilian variations. It seems impractical to prepare against all of those, so 1.e4 is excluded. Against
1.d4 he plays some Benko and Nimzo, but mostly diff
erent lines in the Slav. Black is very solid in some of them. Since I need to win for a prize, it seems better to play something else. Against 1. c4 0, .f6
2. CiJ c3 he seems to play 2. .. c5 with the plan of entering a Hedgehog. It's also very solid. He hasn't
Chapter 7 - Openings 32 1 met any g3-tries in his recent games. Adding the games from 2008 and 2009 doesn't give anything either. When checking all his games, he seems to go into an Anti-Catalan, which I gladly play. I prefer to start with 1.c4 0.f6 2. 0.j3 e6 3.g3 rather than 1. 0.j3 0.f6 2.g3, since the latter allows J...d5. Black can then play systems with ... !J.j5 or ... !J.g4 without being forced to play ... c6. The only possible disadvantage with 1.c4 is l...e5, but he has never played that move. With White, Perunovic plays only J.e4, so he may not have much experience in the English lines with g2-g3. What shall I prepare? Let's check his recent games again. a) Symmetrical English. I will play a move order that avoids the Hedgehog. It might trampose to the Nimzo-lndian, but that's fine. I believe in my analysis there. I have never used that move order before, so he can't prepare agaimt it! b) Anti-Catalan. Checking all his games, he has never played agaimt the line I have in my repertoire. Also, I haven't showed it in TWIC I will check the opening file. c) He has played a lot of Slavs in recent tournaments. Maybe I will check the Anti Slav line briefly. I have three games in TWIC The game from 2009 is not important. In the mainline, I began by losing with 7. 0. a3 Uanuary 2010) and continued by winning with

White has scored 9/ 1 1 . Summary Searching for the opponent's games and rehearsing variations are the most concrete parts of opening preparation. However, the opening files will ideally have been well rehearsed before travelling to a tournament, if possible at regular intervals. Nevertheless, the whole process starts with the choice of opening, continues with the creation of an opening file and the analysis of critical positions. There are four principles to consider when analysing and three when incorporating the analysis in the opening file. The four principles for analysis: A. Analyse normal moves A. Make your own evaluations A. Use the x-technique A. Stop when the branches get too big The three principles when incorporating the analysis: A. All important points are annotated with text A. Irrelevant variations are removed A. Every line ends with an evaluation Studying openings in an active way is definitely a rewarding training method: not only will you surprise your opponents with moves of your own, but you will also learn a lot of standard moves and thus improve your middlegame understanding. Chapter 8 Theoretical Endgames The best way to practise endgames is to decline draw offers, play long games and analyse them thoroughly without the help of a computer. However, with today's shorter time controls, it's also important to know some theoretical endgames by heart. There is simply not enough time to find the solutions over the board. The purpose of this chapter is to discuss how to study those theoretical endgames, while at the same time showing four of them as examples. In the autumn of 2007, I made a list of 1 00 endgames I thought were useful to learn. After that, I challenged a friend to a competition. We had one month to study the 100 endgames before we tested each other. At the competition, we had to play any ending the opponent had chosen from the list of 100 in a rapid game. After five challenges each, we crowned a winner. Since then, we have repeated the competition every year. In between competitions, I barely look at theoretical endgames; once a year or even less is enough to keep them fresh in my mind. At the same time, I made a bet with my friend about which of us would become an IM first. The loser had to eat a straw hat and play a league game wearing a skirt. However, since I cheated by quitting university, I never felt it was fair to demand that he honoured the bet. The list of useful theoretical endgames is found in the appendix on page 370. Most of them are well covered in various endgame manuals, but I have also created a database where they can be downloaded - see the appendix for a link. The endgames I have chosen for this chapter are all quite difficult, but also very valuable to know in a practical game. The endgames I have chosen are all queen or rook endings. 1) Queen and Pawn versus Queen. 2) Queen versus Rook. 3) "Go to the short side" - a Rook ending in-between Philidor's and Lucena's positions. 4) Another Rook ending with one Pawn, this time with the defending king cut off by one or several files. Theoretical endgames are hard work, which is why I think a competition is such a good idea. It's easier to become motivated to study if you know for sure that you will have to play the endgames, Pump Up Your Rating compared to if you wonder whether they will ever appear in your games. Many players know how to checkmate with bishop and knight, but few have played it over the board. I have, but I had the lonely king ... A natural question arises: Is knowledge of theoretical endgames really useful? David Janowski once said: "I detest the endgame. A well-played game should be practically decided in the middlegame." The statement is of course nonsense, but even if it was true, it happens from time to time that we find ourselves in a position we could have studied. Less than a year after I made the list, I reached the following position: 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 Axel Smith - Adam Brzezinski LASK Open, Lund 6th October 2008

Two bishops against a knight - one of the theoretical endgames on my list. I had learned that it's best to defend with the king on b6 or c7 and the knight on b7. White is able to break down such a setup and force Black's king out into the middle, but it's very difficult to stop him from then setting it up in another corner. From one of those corner positions, it should take slightly less than 50 moves to capture the knight with perfect play. Both my friend and I chose this position for our competitions, and neither of us managed to win. Nevertheless, I was optimistic during the game, especially when my opponent offered a draw. By doing this, he showed that he thought it was an easy draw. Actually, the diagram position is mate in 28 moves! lOO.i.d2 liJf8 1 00 ... <i>d6 1 0 l .i.g8 wins the knight.

Queen and pawn versus queen Studying queen-and-pawn versus queen is time well spent, since it's common in tournament games and quite simple to learn. Even after having studied it, it's still easy to misplay the ending over the board, but knowing the basic rules makes it much easier. Queen endings usually involve a lot of checks, but with some pawns on the board, the king is usually able to move across the board to find a hiding place. Even with only a queen and a pawn to hide behind, the winning chances are high. Pawns on one of the four central files are usually winning. The exception is, of course, if the pawn is lost or if there is an immediate perpetual, but also if the defending king manages to block the pawn from advancing. The best defensive option for the king is to stand in front of the pawn (without getting checkmated!) because then a queen exchange leads to a draw, but it may also be sufficient just to stay close. Pure calculation has to answer the question if it's close enough. If the pawn can move, it's not difficult to advance it to the seventh rank. After that, the winning method is to stop the checks with a countercheck, forcing the exchange of queens. The placement of the defending king is therefore of decisive importance. It has to be far away, to avoid such counter-checks. There are two rules to know: I } With rook and knight pawns, it's a draw with the defending king in the opposite corner. 2) With rook pawns, it's a draw with the defending king behind the pawn. Other cases win. The following game illustrates the winning tries and how to defend against them. Axd Smith - Eduard-Andrei Valenu World Junior Championship, Yerevan 2006

The king has reached its final destination! It's a hopeless task to try to stop the pawn from advancing. For example 63.Wfc7t Wff4 and already there are no good checks. It's only possible to stop the pawn when it's on the 7th rank, since the attacking king can't break the Chapter 8 - Theoretical Endgames 327 pin on the pawn by moving to a 9th rank. Also, the kings are further away from each other, reducing the risks of counter-checks. 63 ••• g4 64.VMd6t �g2 65.VMc7 VMf3t 66.�a7 g3 67.YMe5 �fl 68.VMb2t VMe2 69.VMf6t �gl

This is the key posltlon for the whole endgame. Black has two winning methods: 1 ) To play ... 'kt>hl . White must then either check on the h-file (in this case h6) or pin along the diagonal (d5). If Black can cover both of these squares and follow up with ... 'kt>hl , he wins. The key squares for Black's queen are thus c6, e6 and h5. White should never allow him to reach one of those with check! 2) To play ... 'tt> h3. White has to start checking. In that moment, White's king should not be placed on b8, since it allows Black's queen to counter check on g3. The best square for White's queen is d2 since it covers d5, an ideal square for Black's queen. From d5, it would defend the pawn and at the same time cover the king when it starts advancing across the board, as in the second winning method. The secret to the endgame is to look for the white queen's squares along the diagonal and on the h-file, and then find the key squares for Black's queen. Let's examine White's different moves: a) 75.'1Wf2? From f2, the queen can reach h4 (on the h-file) and f3 (on the diagonal). Both are already covered by Black's queen, so he wins immediately with 75 ... 'tt> hl . However, f2 is a bad square even in general, since it's a great risk that Black can check his queen to e4. b) 75.'1Wa2? is not working at all, since the queen can't reach the h-file. Black wins with 75 ... 'tt> h3 76.'1Wb3t 'kt>h4. c) 75.'1Wb2? is also not good. The queen can reach b7 and h8, which makes h7 and c8 key squares. The problem is the king also wants to use the b7-square. 75 ...

It was the l Oth round in the World Junior Championship, and I had 3/10 after the loss. My mood was at zero when I walked to the hotel through the traffic in Yerevan, and I didn't care about all the cars that honked at me when I crossed the streets. I was also glad to know the hotel restaurant had closed, since I felt I didn't deserve any dinner. The next day I had a bye, and could use the time to study the ending. The next time I get it over the board, I promise I will do better! Summary There are three defensive methods: Case 1: The defending king is close to the pawn Case 2: The defending king is in the opposite corner (this works with rook and knight pawns) Case 3: The defending king is behind the pawn (this works with rook pawns) The second case is the most interesting. One of the winning methods is to check the queen to a key square, which in our example with a black h-pawn is a square that covers all White's queen moves to the h-file and to the long diagonal. In this case, c6, e6 and h5 are key squares. After that, Black plays ... 'it>hl . The second winning method is marching the king to the other side of the board. To increase the possibility for counter-checks, the black queen is best placed on d5, where it also defends the pawn. To avoid this, White should keep his queen on d2. White should also avoid having the king on b8, since it creates the possibility of a counter-check on g3. The position is drawn, but difficult to defend over the board. Queen versus rook Queen versus rook is theoretically won, but very difficult to win against best defence. However, it's much easier to play with the queen than the rook - maybe not that surprisingly! In the games I have found, the stronger side won 76% of the games (and blundered the queen once!). Chapter 8 - Theoretical Endgames 333 Queen versus rook is quite common, with 70 games in TWIC in 20 1 1 . David Navara has played it four times, including his famous game against Alexander Moiseenko where he played until it was mate in four and then offered a draw. Navara had unintentionally touched a piece earlier in the game without moving it and had a guilty conscience. For no reason, if you ask me. It's more practically important to learn how to defend the endgame as toughly as possible, but I will start with the winning method.

However, unlike the game from the World Juniors in the previous section, I am happy with my handling of this endgame. I knew the best way of defending, the third rank defence, but there was nothing to be done when Berg played well enough. I don't want to diminish his efforts, but I think these examples have shown that the endgame is not so difficult to win in a practical game. Rook and pawn versus rook Rook endings are the most common endgames, since the rooks start the game in the corner and are not exchanged easily. The most basic rook endgame is rook and pawn versus rook. Pump Up Your Rating The theory of rook endings starts with the third rank defence (Philidor's position) and Lucena's position. I guess those are very familiar to the reader, otherwise; look them up immediately!
[diagram]
The next step is the diagram position and variations of it. It's Black to move, obviously. He has not managed to put up a third rank defence, but White has not reached a Lucena either. The position is normally called "Go to the short side" but holds much more than that simple principle. "Go to the short side" Aron Nimrowitsch's quote about passed pawns is famous: "The Passed Pawn is a criminal, who should be kept under lock and key. Mild measures, such as police surveillance, are not sufficient." In this position, the strategy is instead tricking the pawn into advancing, and then tripping it up. The first rule is to move the king to the short side (in the case above to f8) when it's forced to move. The reason is to leave the other side to the rook, where it has greater checking distance. The second rule is to stay behind the pawn with the rook. With the rook behind the pawn, on el above, White will never be able to play �d7 followed by e5-e6. If White checks on h8, forcing the king to g?, then moves the rook to a8 and plays �d6, then he is threatening e5-e6. In that position, Black must play ...�£7, which is the third rule. But why must the king move to the short side, if the rook only stays behind the pawn? Because White can force Black to use a more complicated defence, by playing his rook to e8 and advancing the pawn. When White has moved the pawn to the sixth rank, the rook must move to the long side to give checks. This is the fourth rule. A top game illustrates all the important points. I have attached all "only-moves" with a D-sign. Levon Aronian - Magnus Carlsen Tal Memorial, Moscow 2006

List of theoretical endgames In this chapter, I have proposed a method of studying theoretical endgames. Four of them have been covered here as examples, but of course there are many more. In the Appendix on page 370 is a list of the 1 00 most important endgames. Some will never appear in your games, others you will see often. The problem is that it's impossible to know in advance which you will face, and when they will appear. The reason I started from the very basics when I made the list - for myself- is because I wanted to feel that I already knew some of them ... Good luck with your endgame studies! Chapter 9 Attitude I don't believe in psychology. I believe in good moves. - Bobby Fischer in 1 972 I studied psychology during my few years at university, and was often told that it must be good for my chess. I disagree, but not in the same way as Fischer did with his statement. I think psychology has a great impact in chess if we take it to mean a kind of 'street-smartness' that chess players gain after taking external factors seriously for many years. Many external factors are connected to chess performance in some way or another. Games are won by good moves, but reasonable time management is required to find the moves. The time management is often a consequence of the concentration level, which in turn depends upon physical and mental preparation. Also, energy lost dealing with noise, draw offers and other disturbing factors influences how easy it is to focus. Chapter overview The subject in this chapter is everything that can be done to win at chess besides playing good moves; how to turn external factors to your advantage. It is divided into six sections. An appeal against draws: It would be beneficial for many players' chess development to play longer games, but we are only human and therefore afraid oflosing. I propose a way of neutralizing that problem. Time management: Few ambitious chess players play too fast; it's rather the opposite. The focus is therefore on how to play faster. I'll tell about my struggle to play faster, and discuss different methods of doing so. At the end of the section, questions about the opponent's time trouble are also raised. Playing weaker opponents: Chess is a practical game, and it's a good idea to avoid simple positions against weaker players. At the same time, objectivity should not be sacrificed. That is not a contradiction. Winning drawish positions: The maxim is clear: It's possible to play for a win in almost any position. Four principles will help you to give your opponents chances to go wrong. Pump Up Your Rating Bad ways of choosing moves: Our human disadvantages are discussed further, since they can spoil our objectivity in many situations. Being aware of those risks makes it easier to prevent them from influencing our thoughts. Concentration: Finally, I'll conclude with some specific advice regarding goals, sleep, food and other important factors that are important for your concentration during games. An appeal against draws I think it's important to play long games to improve as a chess player. For that reason, avoiding draws is a vital topic. In addition, it's useful to be able to play for a win in the last round in many tournaments. What follows is my worst ever game, rendered in full. Axel Smith - Shakhriyar Mamedyarov Synthesia Open, Pardubice 1 7th July 2008 l.e4 e5 2.�f3 �c6 3.J.b5 a6 4.Ba4 d6 5.c3 .Bd7 lh-lf2
[diagram]
I am one of the few players who prepares during rapid tournaments. If it's a small tournament, I prepare against all the players the day before, but in this game, I prepared between the rounds. Mamedyarov played an opening he had used frequently, so what did I prepare here? Certainly not to accept his draw offer! The game wasn't rated and I was far from getting a prize. When I accepted his draw offer, I missed a valuable experience to play against such a strong opponent. For years I wondered if this draw was worth anything at all. Today, I finally understand the value of this game - I can use it as an example of what not to do. Immediately after the game, I was uneasy about it and had a guilty conscience. At the same time I accepted that it was not so easy to resist the temptation to accept the draw offer. I have seen another comical example of this. When I organized the Swedish Championship in 20 1 0, one of the players had a win by default in the first round. He was extremely upset and demanded compensation. Nothing could really calm him down until we finally found a replacement opponent. Then he started playing, but agreed to a draw after eight moves! So why do many players accept draw offers or offer draws, even in promising positions? Because we are afraid of losing! Obviously, it hurts to lose if we have invested a lot of time, work and ambition in chess. A loss not only means that we get zero points in the game, but it also feels as if we have failed as a person. Of course, we understand that's not really the case, but during a game it's easy to be aff ected by a lot of feelings, like the fear of losing. At the right moment, a draw offer can be a useful tool, but you have to start by learning to fight. The best attitude is to accept that Chapter 9 - Attitude 347 occasional losses are inevitable, but that's easier said than done. After the game against Mamedyarov, I concluded that it's useful to have a strict rule. It could be as simple as never taking draws! The advantage of such a rule is that you never need to spend any time considering draw offers or thinking about offering a draw yoursel£ You can use all your energy to find the best moves. I did follow a no-draw rule for a few years. A few weeks before we became a couple, I played against my wife. No way would she get a draw! Following the rule has given me a lot of experience, with more than 350 losses, but it has above all taught me a lot about chess. As you can see from some of the games in this book, I no longer avoid all draws, but today I know that I have the courage to play for a win in every game against any opponent, when I need to. Some of my students have signed a contract to never take draws. That might take it a bit too far, but I really think it's useful to have rules against accepting draw offers. Time management It's safe to say that many ambitious players play too slowly. I think there are three reasons: I) Players who play fast are often considered unserious and lacking in concentration. 2) Being ambitious means, among other things, searching for the very best moves. That can easily lead to time trouble. 3) The desire to search for the truth, which is often not possible in other parts of life, is also time-consuming. We can easily give up a lot of other things for chess, but we have difficulties giving up chess to win games! Ifyou play competitive chess, time management is really an inherent part, not something that the cat has dragged in. With today's short time controls it's even a very important part of the game! And it's a difficult part: there are a lot of difficult decisions in a very limited time. Players who play fast are not unserious, they are pragmatic. It's important to accept that such an attitude is necessary, even in chess. The main aim in this section is therefore to talk about how to avoid time trouble. I used to have a lot of problems with time management. My List of Mistakes shows that I played too slowly in one third of my games in the spring of2008. I decided to check my time management, so during a few tournaments I wrote down the time on the scoresheet after every move. When I analysed the findings, I realized how many mistakes I made due to bad time management. Nine times, I blundered in time trouble. In the same period, I didn't play too fast even once! Many players write down how much time they use during their games, but very few analyse it. I really recommend doing that. For myself, it gave me enough motivation to change my approach to time management. The first step was to decide to hunt for every second. I have not yet stopped and guess I never will. It's so damned difficult to hold on to the seconds I catch! A first concrete rule is never to be late for a game. An equally obvious one is to avoid spending time watching other games in the tournament or thinking about things other than chess. It's not easy, but the first step is deciding to try. If I catch myself thinking about something else, I immediately punish myself for having lost valuable seconds. The game is a fight from the first to the last move. If you know an opening move by heart, you should play it immediately. The same logic is the basis for Leko's rule: When there is only one possible move, play it immediately. It may sound Pump Up Your Rating obvious, but too often I have seen players pondering over only-moves. During the opponent's time, one's thoughts are less concrete and more about general plans. However, if he has a move that is quite probable, it's a good idea to start calculating before he plays it. To be able to make a quick answer not only saves time, but also stops him from using your time to think! For that reason, I often try to play two quick moves following each other in forced sequences. Three years later, in 20 1 1 , I had still not managed to hold on to any seconds, but I had learned to play fast in positions that weren't critical. And that is the most important advice I can offer - try to play fast in positions that aren't critical. It's acceptable to not play the best move in every position. I analysed my time management once again. This time it looked like this: Time Ma nagement Copenhagen Chess Challenge 201 1 (Minutes per move, 9 games) 90 minutes + 30 seconds per move I made 75% of the moves in less than one minute plus the 30 seconds of increment. That saved time for the critical moments. The first of them usually arises immediately after the opening. For me, the first move I have to play on my own usually comes after a bit more than ten moves. In the tournament mentioned above, I spent on average 1 5 minutes for that move. I think that's pretty normal. Even though I played most moves in 1 lh minutes or less, I felt that I still had problems with time trouble. For that reason, I decided to check all the positions where I spent at least one sixth of the remaining time and at least six minutes. Was it really necessary to use so much time there? It happened 35 times during the nine games. Most were critical positions, but after having analysed the positions, I think I used too much time in ten of them. I needed to play even faster. I tried solving the problem in two ways. Firstly, I started to use a chess clock when I solved exercises. As I wrote in Chapter 6, I think it's a good idea to have a defined amount of time for several exercises. It forces you to take responsibility to choose a reasonable move in time. If you haven't finished all the exercises when the time is over, you lose on time. Additionally, you can decide to never use more than 20 minutes for an exercise. The idea is learning to avoid perfectionism. The second way was to formulate the following maxim: the consequences of the mistakes made in time trouble should be equal to the consequences of the mistakes caused by playing too fast. It's a radical maxim, but to me it seems that a balance will give the least number of total mistakes. My argument is that the number Chapter 9 - Attitude 349 of mistakes and the seriousness of them will increase exponentially when having less time. Hence, the probability of making a serious mistake is higher if one move is made in 90 seconds and another move in grave time trouble, say 30 seconds, than if two moves are made in 60 seconds each. If this maxim is accepted, it's easier to avoid beating yourself up about a mistake caused by playing too fast. Such mistakes are necessary to avoid making several mistakes in time trouble! Here is one recent example of the approach I advocate. Axel Smith - Igor Teplyi Borup GM, 22th September 20 1 2 Igor Teplyi is a Griinfeld player and, as so often before, I tried to find the move order that he would like least. l.c4 The idea in the Griinfeld is to undermine the centre. By not occupying it with pawns, I give him nothing to attack! l...g6 l ...lt:lf6 is the normal move order. The idea with l ...g6 is later to threaten ...e5 and either play it or force White to return to normal lines with d2-d4.
2.e4!
The downside to Black's move order; Black can no longer play ... lt:lf6 followed by ...d5. 2 ... c5 For Griinfeld players, I think it makes sense to play 2 ...e5 to steer the game away from normal openings. After the game move, it will normally transpose to a Maroczy Bind, which is not part ofTeplyi's repertoire.
3.�f3 �a5
So this was his idea! a c e g h If I play 5.d4, he has some tries to sharpen the game: a) 5 ... lt:lc6 6 . .!e3 lt:lf6 7.Wfd2 cxd4 8.lt:lxd4 lt:lxe4 b) 5 ... lt:lf6 6 . .!d3 cxd4 7.lt:lxd4 lt:lc6 8 . .!e3 and now 8 ... lt:lg4 or 8 ...d6 9.f3 lt:lg4. Are they dangerous? How much time should be spent in this position?
5.d4
During this tournament, I had a quite odd way of playing faster - I wrote in pencil. Since it's possible to rub out the moves after the game, unlike if they are written in ink, I was hoping I wouldn't take the moves as seriously! It's not the most rational idea I have used, but it worked well at first. I only thought for one minute before playing 5.d4. Ifl don't push d2-d4 immediately, Black will manage to stop it and my opening would be a failure. I am sure that my first four moves have been normal, so by pure logic White should be able to defend against the tricks. Following Pump Up Your Rating Leko's rule, the calculations can be made later, during the opponent's thinking time. 5 ... �c6 If 5 ... lLlf6 then 6 . .Bd2 is one option and 6 . .Bd3 cxd4 7.lLlxd4 lLlc6 8.lLlb3 is another.
6.d5!

7.d6!? was also interesting, to cramp Black's
development. I didn't consider it, probably because I played quite fast. I have accepted that I will miss some interesting possibilities with my approach, but I think the pluses are worth more. I planned to take on d4 next move. If Black takes back with the pawn he closes the diagonal for the g7 -bishop, and if he takes back with the bishop, it might later be attacked. It's therefore logical for Black to exchange on f3. 7 .. JihBt s.Y!Yxf3 d6 9.i.d3 This is a Benoni position where Black has managed to exchange one piece, which is good since he lacks space. On the other hand he has spent a lot of tempos and will need to make another move with his queen. It's also in White's favour that Black hasn't played ... e6xd5 yet. White can consider taking back with the knight, the c-pawn or the e-pawn. So far, so good. I have a slight advantage and plenty of time on the clock. Sadly, later in the game I slowed way down and lost in 45 moves after making a blunder in time trouble! So there is still work to do on my time management. The rest of the game is not so interesting, so I was tempted to omit it, but I shall just give the bare moves as an example of the horrors of time trouble. 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 9 ... �£6 10.Y!Ye2 O-O 1 1.O-O e6 12J��ad1 ges 13 . .Bc2 a6 14.h3 Y!Yc7 15 . .Bf4 exd5

�xg4 0-1 At the time of writing I have only reached a 2-to- 1 proportion for mistakes in time trouble Chapter 9 - Attitude 35 1 compared to mistakes caused by playing too fast, instead of the 1-to-1 my maxim recommends. Anyway, experimenting with my maxim has improved my results. Since I had a lot of problems with blunders in time trouble, I needed to take strong measures. For others who are rarely in time trouble, it may be enough to remind yourself that the clock is a very important part of competitive chess. Summary - avoiding time trouble A. Write down how much time you have used on the scoresheet, and analyse the findings A. Decide that every second is important A. Never be late for a game A. Don't watch other games and try to avoid thinking of other things during a game A. Don't spend time thinking in opening positions where you know what you will play A. Follow Leko's rule: when there is only one possible move, play it immediately A. If the opponent has a very probable move, try to decide on your reply while he is thinking and play it soon after he has played his move A. Don't spend much time in positions that aren't critical - it's acceptable to not play the best move in every position A. Use a chess clock when solving exercises A. Accept that it's okay to make mistakes caused by playing too fast The opponent's time trouble It's not unsporting to win due to the opponent's time trouble. I do whatever I can to get his clock ticking. If he is watching another game, I make my move as silently as possible, avoid writing it down and continue to think. If he only takes a hasty look at the board, he might think that it's still my move. I can understand if this sounds too competitive. Of course, I don't advocate any kind of unsporting behaviour, like slamming the clock or knocking over the pieces. My behaviour is more peaceful, like following the first piece of advice from Swedish Grandmaster Stellan Brynell. Brynell's first advice: If your opponent thinks for a long time, don't leave the board! It may wake him up from the doze. When he is about to move, it may be sensible to stand up, because he may become uncertain and use even more time.

According to the Riis rule, named after the chess player Jens Riis from Lund, a bishop should not be placed on a square where it threatens a pawn that is defended by two pawns. For that reason, I avoided 7 ... .Bd6 - White's pawn on g3 is defended by two pawns. It's also useful that the bishop avoids coming under threat after a future lDxe4. Pump Up Your Rating The position is quite simple, but Carlhammar started to think and think. I was fried by the sun and the sweat was pouring, but I concentrated on sitting still to avoid waking him up from his trance. A friend visited the playing hall, but I ignored him. Then my left cheek started to itch, my back hurt and my right hand fell asleep. But I managed to stay still for the time it took Carlhammar to move - 54 minutes. All the pain was worth it when he lost on time in a dead-equal position. The rest of the game is shown in the next section. Another time when I was trying to be quiet to avoid disturbing my opponent from wasting his time, there was a live wire that gave me small electric shocks. That time, I couldn't stay quiet long enough. My message is not to act like I do, just become aware of and accept the practical side of the game. If you succeed with the strategy of getting your opponent into time trouble, you must then know what to do when he is in time trouble. You should never play "for time" when you have a good position, but if you are worse, then Brynell's second piece of advice is useful. Brynell's second advice: When your opponent is in time trouble, don't play for simple tactics, since these are the easiest to defend against. Play unforcing moves, slowly strengthening your position. Every serious chess player needs to think about time management. I guess that most of the readers of this book will play too slowly from time to time. I still occasionally struggle with bad thinking habits. In the above game against Teplyi, I spent two-thirds of my remaining time on my 2 1 st move. Four moves before the time control at move 40, I made a move that lost the game. Some will never learn! I hope you do. Playing weaker opponents I created some statistics for my games against weaker opponents and tried to draw some conclusions about why I lose points when I do. Generally, I think that it's best to try to play the best move, not considering the opponent's rating. However, it's a good idea to adapt the choice of opening, especially with Black. For example, I would rather go for an unbalanced Sicilian than a symmetrical Open game when I play an opponent I want to beat. I also try to avoid much theory, by playing openings with mainly positional decisions. The idea is that playing strength should have a greater impact than memorizing forcing opening variations. Time trouble was the main reason in more than a third of the games where I lost points against weaker opponents. They make unexpected moves relatively often, and it's natural to use more time in such cases, which makes it important to intensify the fight against time trouble. Sometimes it's difficult to find a good way to avoid simplifications. In those situations your mind must be very open! I tried to take that approach in the game against Carlhammar - we saw the opening of this game in a previous section.

White tries to exchange everything and get a draw. I did not want to cooperate with that plan, but I have to watch out to avoid getting a worse pawn structure. Instead of 1 2. .. exd5, can you see an alternative that gives Black equality in a more interesting position? 12 ... exd5?! I was not dynamic enough to find an alternative. According to Houdini, Black has easy equality even if he doesn't make any 1 2th move at all! It would be a bit dull if I listed 20 moves as possible solutions, so I will just propose a few options: 1 2. ..cxd5 1 3.cxd5 e5 unbalancing the pawn structure, or 12 ... '1Wa5 or 12 ... '\Wc?, all with equal chances and some play left. If you managed to find any move, it doesn't matter which, you did better than me!

Black has a comfortable position, but the natural pawn lever ...d5 leads to the exchange of two pairs of pawns and possibly also knights and a few heavy pieces. In the game I instead restricted myself to ...d6 to avoid simplifications. Of course there is still every chance to create something, but I didn't handle that well. The final part of the game can be found later in the chapter. The best advice to avoid getting dull positions against weaker opponents is to be conscious of the risks. However, sometimes it happens anyway but that doesn't have to be the end of the game. Wmning drawish positions The most important advice is to try, try again and then try even more. It's possible to win (and lose!) surprisingly many positions. Let's start with a shocking example. Jon Ludvig Hammer - Pal Reyset Norwegian League, Oslo 1 5th January 20 1 2

Chapter 9 - Attitude 355 White has an extra knight, but it has to stay at the queenside to watch Black's passed pawn. The king can't leave the g5-pawn. Hammer made the best of the situation, by behaving confidently and playing: l.�b4! I saw R0yset collapse in his chair, and he soon resigned. Hammer immediately showed him: l.. . cl=�! I really felt sorry for R0yset. White can win a pawn, but the position is an easy draw.

I am opposed to slamming the clock or using any other similar methods, but I have nothing against winning on time. Chess is a practical game, and if the opponent thinks for too long, there is no need to be ashamed of using the clock as a factor against him.

I will start with an example I am not particularly proud of. The position looks blocked, but White has space and some ideas to sacrifice a knight. lt:lh4xg6 will not work as long as Black keeps a rook on the h-file and the king on f7, and the pawn on a5 is easily defended with both rooks. The only remaining idea for White is ttJa3/c3-b5. Before executing this move I should double rooks on the a-file.

White had three seconds left and Black sixteen. To end the game without ill feeling, I had a nice chat with Malte Burwick afterwards and, yes, I think justice was done in the end. Principle 2: Don't show that you are playing on time. Repetitions should not be made too early, since that makes the opponent aware of the impact of the chess clock. For the same reason, I never write down my opponent's time on my scoresheet. Principle 3: Don't force the position, but look like you are! The longer it's possible to keep many options open, the more time the opponent will use, but only if he thinks that you are trying to create something. Harmless threats can also make him nervous, or perhaps he will try an unjustified active defence. Triangulation is one good way of doing nothing but looking like you are. The opponent often thinks that there is something deep going on. If the opponent only defends passively, which is easy to notice within a few moves, a good positional improvement is to gain space. Often he will continue to stay passive, until he has no choice. The following game is a good example of this.

What strikes me with this rook ending is that White's position didn't collapse due to one mistake, but due to the sum of many small inaccuracies. Principle 4: Give the opponent possibilities to go for dubious exchanges. When the precious draw is within reach, everyone wants to end the game as soon as possible. It's an automatic belief to think that piece exchanges are the fastest way to do so. Often the player who wants a draw will go for exchanges without noticing that this also means making a positional concession. In the following game, I used all four principles in a drawish position. 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 AbdullaMuhsen - Axel Smith Norwegian Team Championship, 1 5th October 20 1 0

The position is balanced, with slightly weak pawns on b2 and a4. The a4-pawn is especially weak in case of a queen exchange. Black has the bishop, but has difficulties creating play.

I have followed Mragel Vrillestad's 'confusion method', named after a chess legend from Lund. The idea is to triangulate in an unforcing position, in order to confuse the opponent. He may think that something deep is going on. It's a natural thought, since here there is no idea at all behind losing the move! When he is given the move, he might overreact to clarify the position. I know this method sounds bizarre, but I have used it several times with good results. A player, who before has only had to react to the
362 Pump Up Your Rating
opponent's threats, may actually see having the move as a problem in a stressful situation. In this game, it was never a threefold repetition but some sort of triangulation. White doesn't want to move the knight and allow ... 'Ra2, and after 43.'it>h2 'Rb5, it's no longer possible to break the pin in one move.

This move must have been what he overlooked. Black is winning, but it took me another 60 moves to finish the game (0- 1 , 1 09 moves) . One circumstance that actually helps if you want to win very drawish positions is if the opponent wants the draw very badly. In those situations, keep on playing, while you give the opponent possibilities to come "closer" to the draw. The four principles outlined in this section are: Principle 1: It's not unsportsmanlike to win on time. Principle 2: Don't show that you are playing on time. Principle 3: Don't force the position, but look like you are! Principle 4: Give the opponent possibilities to go for dubious exchanges. Chapter 9 - Attitude 363 Bad ways of choosing moves Human are not robots (yet) . Normally we are grateful for that fact, but it also allows us to have irrational reasons for choosing moves. Ideally, all feelings should be set aside until the tournament is over, but it's not so easy to avoid letting them influence our thoughts. That's a pity, since chess punishes irrelevant thoughts without mercy. This may not be the machines' only advantage in their fight against humans, but it should not be neglected. However, by being conscious of the possible pitfalls, it's easier to avoid them. Trying to make up for previous mistakes It's very common that a mistake is followed by more mistakes. When feeling uneasy about the situation, it's easy to lose objectivity and set one final cheap trap. In this way, the game is finished as soon as possible, but probably lost. It's never good to try to make up for previous mistakes. The new situation has to be considered as it is, not through a tinted lens. Thinking about others' opinions "What will they say ifl play this stupid-looking move and lose?" is a question that ruins one's self-confidence. The opposite is also possible - playing a move to impress the spectators. I once noticed that one of my students often made his move when I came to watch his game. After that experience, I always watch friends' games from behind, so they can't see me. Not trusting your judgment The consequence is inconsistent play, alternating between plans. Your own judgment may be wrong, but you have nothing better to trust. If you believe that an attack on the king is strategically justified, it should be played. When having a good position against a stronger opponent, anxious feelings may arise. The lower-rated player often becomes cautious to avoid all possible counterplay. Such an attitude must be avoided! Instead, the same mechanism can be used when the tables are turned: when defending a lost position. In those situations it pays to play a bit more aggressively than is objectively justified. The opponent doesn't want "unnecessary'' complications, and he can thus be expected to go for the safe but passive option. Falling in love with a move After having spent a lot of time calculating a move, and maybe even having found some nice tactics, it's easy to get emotionally attached to it. If the calculation ends up with the conclusion that it doesn't work, sometimes it's played anyway! The line of thought, often subconsciously, sounds like: "The opponent will surely not see that much, and if he does, something new may turn up along the way''. No! Never lie to yourself! It's better to throw all emotions away, swallow the frustration and look for a new move. Concentration For me, the main difference between a good and a bad tournament is how well I manage to keep other thoughts away during the games, and I'm quite often dissatisfied with how well I manage. For that reason, I was perplexed and envious when I learned that Viswanathan Anand complained that he had one irrelevant thought during his whole match against Vladimir Kramnik in Bonn 2008! It happened after 22 moves in the 1 Oth game. After Kramnik's 23.'1Wa6! Anand returned to reality (chess!). The truth may not be that black and white, but I like to think of Anand as a good example (though I try not to think of this during a game!). The closest I have come to Anand's Pump Up Your Rating extraordinary concentration was when I washed the car that picked him up when he visited Kristiansund. The Norwegian Grandmaster Jon Ludvig Hammer has pointed out that Magnus Carlsen gets more exhausted than his rivals after a game, despite being physically fitter than most of them. Hammer says he would love to learn how Carlsen manages to give everything. Bobby Fischer, who said he didn't believe in psychology, was nevertheless disturbed by silent cameras. Well, the first step towards good concentration is accepting that external factors have a huge impact. Having come so far, there are several pieces of advice worth following. Goals The most important goals are for the training program. They are discussed in the introduction to the second part of this book. But the goal that's set before a tournament will affect your concentration. Such a goal should be effort-based and short-sighted, not focusing on more than the next game. It's dangerous to have a results-oriented goal, like 'reaching six points'. If your score is 4Yz points before the final round, it may be hard to find motivation, since the goal is unreachable. The same may happen if your score is already 6 points. Rating performance is also a whimsical goal - it depends so much on chance and the play of your opponents. All similar goals increase the risk of having irrelevant thoughts. It's better to have an effort-based goal, such as 'concentrating well'. That kind of goal is always relevant, whatever the results in the previous games. Good concentration depends a lot on your level of motivation. If motivation is a problem, it's a good idea to use one day before the tournament to prepare mentally. One useful thing is to get rid of all the work that is hanging over your head, but it's also good to use some time to think about how it would feel to lose, and then imagine being fully focused, and winning games. Irrelevant thoughts A common mistake is to think way ahead, beyond the game. It might be about the next round, the prize-giving ceremony or the imminent celebration of your inevitable triumph. Another common mistake is to think backwards, re-calculating moves that are long gone or evaluating the opening choice. All our thoughts should deal with the current position! In particular, many players have problems getting over a loss. They constantly ask themselves why they made such a ridiculous mistake, or something similar. This clearly makes it more difficult to focus on the next game. I think it's a good habit to avoid analysing games during the tournament, except for the post-mortem and the opening. The post mortem can't be saved until later, and the opening may be important for forthcoming rounds. Anyway, a game should not be checked with an engine before it has been analysed with a trainer or a training partner, and there is seldom enough time for that between rounds. At first, curiosity demands that you should get 'the answer' immediately, but after some time, you learn to wait. All conclusions and 'blame' are better left until after the tournament. So how should irrelevant thoughts be avoided? The first step is simply deciding that you want to avoid such thoughts. Afterwards, you will automatically start to scold yourself when you discover your mind thinking of something irrelevant. This helps, but it requires practice, just like everything else. There is also a lot of truth behind the old Chapter 9 - Attitude 365 saying " What you do in practice will carry over into competition. " So try to be well-focused when solving exercises. It's possible to practise concentration at home, for example by trying to keep a focused, blank mind during five minutes every day. It is also a good idea to prepare mentally before a tournament, as mentioned previously. Meditation is the next step for the ambitious. Sleep and food It's self-evident that getting enough sleep is important, but how much is enough? Logically, it means waking up before the alarm clock rings. Sleeping time should be planned with some margin. It's also good to follow Hector's principle, named after the Swedish Grandmaster Jonny Hector: In order to get the brain ready, you have to wake up at least two hours before the game. In addition, it saves energy to have fixed routines; all energy can be spent on chess instead of taking other decisions. When I first travelled to a tournament with my Norwegian club, they were stunned to learn that I took sleeping so seriously (boringly!). After that, they could not stop repeating this over and over again, maybe a bit too often. It is not the best idea to tell an eight-year-old kid who is thinking about starting to play chess that he must take great care of his sleep! In contrast, I only follow the two principles mentioned above during tournaments. At home, I never manage to keep a regular daily rhythm - the day is just too short! Ironically, it's the middle of the night as I am writing this, and 42 hours since I slept. The most important thing is, as usual, to take sleep seriously. The game against Teplyi was played in a tournament where the organizer offered tided players "accommodation". I wrote to them to make sure this didn't mean air beds in barracks together with a dozen other players. They answered that it didn't, which was true. I stayed in a small storeroom in a school, without a shower and without the possibility of being there during the day. It was difficult to sleep, with an alarm triggered in the middle of the night and a security guard coming early in the morning. In addition, the room had two gigantic windows without curtains. One morning I heard a lot of children's voices, calling: "Come, come and look! There is a man sleeping here!" I seldom criticize organizers, maybe because I am one mysel£ That time was a bit over the line, though. Playing seriously in a tournament requires having the chance of a good night's sleep. Food is also important, but everything regarding that subject is very individual. An attitude that doesn't work for some may work well for others. The best method is to use trial and error to find out what works for you. Nevertheless, a few general points can be made. Digestion will take energy from the brain if it has to work too hard, such as if you eat a heavy meal shortly before a game. Sugar is also dangerous; it heightens the level of blood sugar temporarily and gives a lot of energy, but makes it drop even further later on. The only solution to keep the level of blood sugar steady, if you have started to eat sweets, is to continue eating for the whole game! When I started to take chess seriously, I found it natural to stop drinking coffee. Therefore, I was surprised to learn the advice Jesper Hall received when he talked to a nutritionist about chess and food: Eat pasta (long carbohydrates)
1 Y2 hours before you start playing, and drink
coffee (a psychoactive drug) during the game. Nevertheless, everyone has to decide what works for him or her, and I think I do better
366 Pump Up Your Rating
without coffee. One argument is to avoid having a reason to leave the board. Physical preparation Magnus Carlsen blamed having less physical exercise than usual for his bad results in the autumn of 20 10. Physical activity gives surplus energy and helps with focusing. I think it's a good idea to do something every day during a tournament. It doesn't need to take more than 5- 1 0 minutes to go for a short run. When I learned that Hans Tikkanen practised keeping his breath while swimming underwater, I thought it was too odd. When I learned that Bobby Fischer had done the same, I suddenly became more interested! When the inhalation of oxygen stops for some time, the brain has to make more out of less, and expands the capillaries. Coming back to normal circumstances, blood flow is increased. The idea is more or less the same as with altitude training, which many athletes do. Other disturbances My greatest hobby is reading books, which is exactly why I have prohibited myself from reading them during tournaments. It's easy for the mind to get excited, and it may occupy your thoughts during the games. However, there are some books that are easy to stop thinking about, such as those with known endings, like biographies. Personally, earplugs do a great job shutting out all noise during games, and they also remind me that I should be in a competitive mood, focusing as well as possible. Another thing that may disturb you during games is having any valuable belongings - subconsciously some energy is used to worry about them being stolen. As I am quite extreme, I also get disturbed by opponents clicking their pens. Sometimes I bring non clickable pens to hand over to them. However, in this case the problem is better found in me! Anyway, I think it's a good idea not to hesitate in letting opponents or spectators know when they are disturbing you. It's much worse to sit and hope that they will stop by themselves. Lastly, being in love definitely disturbs one's concentration, but I think it's high time I stop before I say something I will regret. .. A final word The chapter has reached its end and it's time for a final conclusion. External factors are very important, at least for those of us who don't find good moves as easily as we see hidden conspiracies. To keep the summary very brief: everything matters. When one game has ended, it's already time to focus on the next game. This book has also come to an end. As I wrote in the introduction, this project feels like the final goal after five years with chess. It has been a real pleasure to write it - reliving all my tough losses, but also some fantastic moments. It is a coincidence that we end with the words "next game", but they fit very well. There will always be a next game. Appendix - Databases Gigabase You need a big database to search for your opponent's games. It's good if it contains annotated games, like ChessBase's MegaBase, but there are also free versions. Every week, it's possible to download new games via TWIC [A] . In addition, it's worthwhile pasting pgn-files from local club events or tournaments; those players will be your most regular opponents. When searching for a specific opponent, it's important to merge the different spellings of his or her name [A] . It is actually a bit tricky with players from some countries, since they mix the first and last names. Reference When studying openings, it's useful to use the flap "Reference" to see played games. To do this, one database has to be marked as a "Reference database" [A] . Since mostly games by strong players are interesting, I recommend creating a smaller database only with games where both players have an Elo of 2450+ (or another limit of your preference). When a new TWIC is downloaded, I search for 2450+ games and copy them to the Reference-database. For sure, many interesting games will be overlooked, but it's not possible to check everything. Another advantage with a small "Reference database" is that it takes a much shorter time to search. For me, with a powerful PC and an analysis engine running at full pace, the difference is between two seconds and more than two minutes {it never finished, as I lost patience). Such delays are mildly irritating, to say the least. My games The most important database is of course the one with your own games, preferably annotated. It's also good to know what information your opponents have. That's not possible to check in the Gigabase, since most opponents hopefully don't have access to pgn-files from local tournaments. Instead, I use the variable "Source" to mark all games in "My games" which are saved in public databases such as "TWIC''. When I want to know which games my opponent can use in his preparation, it's easy to search for the source "TWIC" [A] . Working database It's useful to have a database where on-going work can be saved. In that way, it's easy to remember what you should analyse next. However, the working database also has other purposes. If you have a powerful PC at home and a laptop at tournaments, it might be messy with copies of every file. I think it's easiest to have the original databases at home, and save work done at tournaments in the working database. Another important reason for having a working database is that it becomes easier to send games or analysis to a training partner [A] .

There are also safety reasons. Sometimes, ChessBase replaces the wrong game when saving, thus deleting a game. It is better if that doesn't happen in an opening database. Twice at tournaments my ChessBase program has announced "Program Error" and then deleted everything in the ChessBase bases-folder. When that happened, I was very happy I had everything saved at another location on the laptop. This shows the importance of regularly making backup copies. Opening databases It's impossible to get an overview if all the analysis is saved in a single game. It's useful to split it in a lot of different databases and games. Appendix - ChessBase This is a short appendix, explaining the most important functions. For more information - see the ChessBase manual! Words labelled with * * refer to labels in the ChessBase program. Databases Download games: Visit TWIC at www.theweekinchess.com.

Appendix - Databases 369 Send games: With an e-mail client, it's possible to mark one or several games, right click and choose *e-mail selected games*. This command is also useful in another way. Now and then ChessBase refuses to save a game, which can be quite annoying. In those situations, it still works to click *File*, *Send*, *Games* and e-mail it to yourself! To send a whole database, all 1 6 ChessBase files (cba, cbc, cbe and so on) have to be transformed into one (cbv). In the main window, mark a database and click on *Tools*, *Database* and *Backup database*. Choose where to save the file, and attach it in an e-mail.

Create an opening book: Mark all games, and use the command Shift + Enter. Games The engine's number of moves: Click on + or - to increase or decrease the number of shown moves. Split games: It's easiest to copy the game to the "Work database" and copy it back. One variation is kept in the first copy of the game and another in the second. (To see how many half-moves of analysis a game contains, hold the mouse over the column *VCS* on the same line as the game.) Create coloured squares and arrows: Press Alt (green), Alt + Control (Yellow) or Alt + Shift (Red) when right-clicking on a square or right-dragging the mouse between two squares. Enter a null-move: Press Ctrl + Alt + 0. Merge games: Save both games in the same database, mark them and press Enter. The last game is incorporated in the first one. If there are different move orders, they are also merged. It's possible to change the move order in a game. If an opening file starts with l .d4 ltlf6 2.c4 e6 3.ltlf3 d5 4.g3, and should be changed to l .d4 ltlf6 2.c4 e6 3.g3 d5 4.ltlf3, the easiest process is as follows: 1) Create a new game with the correct move order 2) Copy it to the same database as the original game, and place it higher up in the database 3) Merge the games Training: Open a game, click on the flap *Training*. The board is shown, but not the moves. Shortcuts: Some of the most useful shortcuts in ChessBase are Ctrl R (save/replace the game), Ctrl A (open text annotation), Ctrl K (add engine), Ctrl Y (delete variation), Shift = (set evaluation), Shift 1 (set exclamation mark etc.) and Alt j (promote variation). Appendix - List of theoretical endgames I have graded the endgames from 1 to 4 stars, based on how difficult they are to learn and how probable it is that they will appear.
