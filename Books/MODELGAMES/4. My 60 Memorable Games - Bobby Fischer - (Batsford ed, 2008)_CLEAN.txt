When champions meet Bobby Fischer's Tournament and Match Record Index to Openings List of Opponents Author's Preface The 60 games annotated in this volume were all played during 1957 through '67 and, with the exception of nos. 44 and 50, under strict tournament conditions. The notes frequently include references to additional games, occasionally presenting them in full. An interested reader will find 34 of my earlier efforts in Bobby Fischer's Games of Chess (Simon and Schuster, 1959). All of the 60 here offered contain, for me, something memorable and exciting - even the 3 losses. I have tried to be both candid and precise in my elucidations in the hope that they would offer insights into chess that will lead to fuller understanding and better play. Finally, I wish to express my gratitude to Larry Evans, friend and colleague, for his invaluable aid in the preparation of the text as well as for his lucid introductions.
ROBERT J. FISCHER
New York City

On the chessboard lies and hypocrisy do not survive long. The creative combination lays bare the presumption of a lie; the merciless fact, culminating in a checkmate, contradicts the hypocrite.

1 Fischer - Sherwin [ U.S.A. ]
NEW JERSEY OPEN CHAMPIONSHIP 1957
SICILIAN DEFENSE
Too little, too late Although Sherwin makes no serious errors in the opening, he misses several equalizing opportunities. Demonstrating the technical virtuosity that is to become his hallmark, Fischer, with astonishing maturity, gradually strengthens his grip by accumulating small advantages: the better center and the two Bishops. Sherwin, meanwhile, attempts to consolidate his position - only to see his 14-year-old opponent shatter it with a thunderbolt (18 xh7). It brings to mind Alekhine's combinations, which also seemed to spring from nowhere. Sherwin, lashing back, refuses to fall. However, his defense finally disintegrates under a series of acute blows to his wobbly King.
1 e4 c5
2 f3 e6
3 d3 ...
This used to be my favorite. I thought it led to a favorable variation of the King's Indian reversed, particularly after Black has committed himself with ...e6. 3 ... c6
4 g3 f6
Fischer-Ivkov, Santa Monica 1966 continued 4...d5 5 bd2 d6 6 g2 ge7 7 O-O O-O 8 h4! with chances for initiative.
5 g2 e7
6 O-O O-O
More usual is 6...d5; but Black has purposely delayed placing his center Pawns. Has he a new idea in mind? 7 bd2 ... After 7 e5 d5 8 bd2 f6 9 exf6 xf6 10 e1 gives White an edge. 7 ... b8 Sherwin slid the Rook here with his pinky, as if to emphasize the cunning of this mysterious move. 7...d5 8 e1 b5 9 e5 d7 10 f1 b4
11 h4 a5 12 f4 a4 13 a3! Fischer-Mjagmasuren, Sousse Interzonal
1967, leads to double-edged play where Black's chances on the Q-side countervail White's K-side attack - but White usually comes first.
8 e1 d6
9 c3 b6
Not bad. But I had expected 9...b5 10 d4 cxd4! (if 10...b4 11 e5! bxc3? [11...dxe5 12 dxe5 d7 13 c4 holds the advantage] 12 exf6 cxd2 13 xd2! wins a piece) 11 cxd4 d5 with equality.
10 d4 c7?
This leads to trouble. Black should strive for counterplay by opening the c-file: 10...cxd4 11 cxd4 d5 12 e5 d7, etc. 11 e5! d5 Worse is 11... d7 12 exd6 xd6 13 e4 cxd4 14 xd6 xd6 15 f4 e5 16 xe5! dxe5 17 cxd4 winning a Pawn. The best try is 11...dxe5 12 dxe5 d7 13 e2 b7 14 h4 with a bind, but Black's game may be tenable. 12 exd6 xd6 13 e4! c4 An unpleasant choice, since it releases the pressure in the center and gives White a free hand to start operations on the K-side. However, other moves lose material: A] 13... e7 14 c4 f6 15 f4, etc. B] 13...cxd4 14 xd6 xd6 15 c4! f6 16 f4 and again the lineup on this diagonal is unfortunate. 14 xd6 xd6 15 g5! ce7? A bad mistake. Black's game is still tenable after 15...h6 16 e4 d8. 16 c2! g6 On 16...f5? 17 e2 picks off a Pawn. Had Sherwin seen what was coming, however, he might have chosen 16...g6 17 e4 c7 18 h6 d8, though 19 d2 prepares to exploit his weakened dark squares.
17 h4 f6
Apparently everything's defended now. Unappetizing is 17... d8 (17...h6 18 h5 hxg5 19 hxg6 f6? 20 e2-h5) 18 xh7! xh7 19 h5 f5 20 hxg6+ xg6 21 e5! with a bind. 18 xh7! ... Throwing a monkey wrench into Black's carefully contrived setup! As usual, tactics flow from a positionally superior game. 18 ... xh7 Not 18... xh7? 19 f4.
19 h5 h4!
The best fighting chance. Not 19... e7 20 f4 wins a clear exchange.
20 f4 d8
21 gxh4 ... 21 xb8? xg2 22 xg2 b7+ 23 f3 xb8. 21 ... b7! 22 h6! ... He's hoping for 22 xb7 xb7 and, suddenly, the initiative passes to Black despite his material deficit. 22 ... xh4 Once again, time-pressure had Sherwin burying his thumbs in his ears. Instead of trying to mix it up, Black should keep his King sheltered as long as possible with 22...g6 23 h5! g5 (if 23...gxh5 24 e2), but 24 e5 stays a Pawn ahead with two Bishops. It might still be a fight, though. 23 hxg7 xg7? Suicidal. The last hope would have been 23... d8 24 g3 h6, though 25 e2 is hard to meet (if 25...b5 26 a4 a6 27 axb5 axb5 28 a8). 24 e4! ... Threatening 25 e5+. 24 ... h5 25 e3! ... Now the Rook joins the King hunt - and it's murder. The immediate threat is 26 h3 g6 27 g3. 25 ... f5
26 h3 e8
26... g6? 27 g3.
27 e5+ ... White can pick off a couple of exchanges with 27 h6+ g8 28 xf8 xf8 29 xb7, etc. But by now I felt there was more in the offing. 27 ... f6
27... g8? 28 g3+ f7 29 g7 mate.
28 d2! f7
29 g5 e7
On 29... e7 30 h7+ is devastating. 30 xf6 xf6 31 h7+ e8 32 xf6 xh7 On 32... xf6 33 xb7 nets a whole Rook. 33 c6+ Black resigns If 33... d7 34 xe6+.
2 Fischer - Larsen [ Denmark ]
PORTOROZ 1958
SICILIAN DEFENSE
Slaying the dragon Although the Sicilian, as a whole, is still the best fighting defense at Black's disposal, much of the steam has been taken out of the time-honored Dragon Variation. This is one of the key games which helped to batter its reputation. In a laudable attempt to create complications, Larsen deviates from the book on move 15. That proves to be disastrous, since his counterattack never gets started. Mechanically, routinely, Fischer pries open the h-file, sacrificing first a Pawn and then the exchange. There is an aura of the inevitable about the outcome. Here the notes are as instructive and lucid as the text, which is an object lesson in how to mount an assault against the fianchettoed King.
1 e4 c5
2 f3 d6
3 d4 cxd4
4 xd4 f6
5 c3 g6
Larsen was one of the diehards who refused to abandon the Dragon until recently. White's attack almost plays itself ... weak players even beat Grandmasters with it. I once thumbed through several issues of Shakhmatny Bulletin, when the Yugoslav Attack was making its debut, and found the ratio was something like nine wins out of ten in White's favor. Will Black succeed in reinforcing the variation? Time will tell.
6 e3 g7
6... g4? still loses to 7 b5+.
7 f3 O-O
8 d2 c6
9 c4 ...
This refinement supersedes the old O-O-O. The idea is to prevent ...d5. 9 ... xd4 Just how Black can attempt to thread his way to equality is not clear. Interesting is Donald Byrne's 9...a5. The strongest reply is 10 g4 and if
10... e5 11 e2 d5? 12 g5! wins a Pawn.
10 xd4 e6
11 b3 a5
12 O-O-O b5
After 12... xb3 13 cxb3! Black cannot make any attacking headway against this particular Pawn configuration. White is lost in the King and Pawn ending, it's true, but Black usually gets mated long before then. As Tarrasch put it: "Before the endgame the gods have placed the middle game."
13 b1 b4
14 d5 ...
Weaker is 14 e2 xb3 15 cxb3 fd8. 14 ... xd5 Bad judgment is 14... xd5? 15 xg7 xg7 16 exd5 d7 17 de1 with a crushing bind. (Suetin-Korchnoi, USSR Championship prelims
1953.)
15 xd5 ... Stronger is 15 exd5! b5 16 he1 a5 17 e2! (Tal-Larsen, Zurich 1959) where White abandons the attack and plays for pressure along the e-file instead. 15 ... ac8? The losing move. After the game Larsen explained he was playing for a win, and therefore rejected the forced draw with 15... xd5 16 xg7 c3+ 17 bxc3 (17 xc3 bxc3 18 xc3 xc3 19 bxc3 fc8 renders White's extra Pawn useless.) 17... ab8! 18 cxb4 xb4+! 19 xb4 xb4+ 20 b2 fb8, etc. After 15... xd5, however, I intended simply 16 exd5 xd5 17 xb4, keeping the game alive. 16 b3! ... He won't get a second chance to snap off the Bishop! Now I felt the game was in the bag if I didn't botch it. I'd won dozens of skittles games in analogous positions and had it down to a science: pry open the h-file, sac, sac ... mate! 16 ... c7 This loss of time is unfortunately necessary if Black is ever to advance his a-Pawn. 16... b5? is refuted by 17 xa7.
17 h4 b5
There's no satisfactory way to impede White's attack. If 17...h5 18 g4! hxg4 (18... fc8 19 dg1 hxg4 20 h5! gxh5 21 fxg4 xe4 22 f4 e5 23 xe4 exd4 24 gxh5 h8 25 h6 f6 26 g7! wins) 19 h5! gxh5 (on 19... xh5 20 xg7 xg7 21 fxg4 f6 22 h6+ mates) 20 fxg4 xe4 (on
20...hxg4 21 dg1 e5 22 e3 d8 23 h6; or 20... xg4 21 dg1 xd4
22 xg4+! hxg4 23 h6 leads to mate) 21 e3 f6 (21... xd4 22 xe4 g7 23 xh5) 22 gxh5 e5 23 h6 wins. Now Black is threatening to get some counterplay with ...a5-a4. 18 h5! ... There's no need to lose a tempo with the old-fashioned g4. 18 ... fc8 On 18...gxh5 19 g4! hxg4 20 fxg4! xe4 21 h2 g5 22 xg7 xg7
23 d5 c5 24 h6+ g8 25 xg5+ xg5 26 xh7 mate.
19 hxg6 hxg6
20 g4 ...
Not the impatient 20 xf6? xf6 21 h6 e6! (threatening ... e5) and Black holds everything. 20 ... a5 Now Black needs just one more move to get his counterattack moving. But for the want of a nail the battle was lost...
21 g5 h5
Vasiukov suggests 21... e8 as a possible defense (not 21...a4? 22 gxf6 axb3 23 fxg7! bxc2+ 24 xc2! e5 25 h2 wins); but White crashes through with 22 xg7 xg7 (22... xg7? 23 h2) 23 h6! e6 (if 23...a4
24 h2 h5 25 xg6+) 24 h2 h5 25 xe6! fxe6 (25... xg5 26
xg6+! xg6 27 xc8, threatening g1) 26 xg6+ g7 27 h1, etc. 22 xh5! ... Fine wrote: "In such positions, combinations are as natural as a baby's smile." 22 ... gxh5 No better is 22... xd4 23 xd4 gxh5 24 g6 e5 (if 24...e6 25 xd6) 25 gxf7+ h7 (if 25... f8 26 xe5 dxe5 27 g1 e6 28 xe6 e7 29 xc8 xc8 30 g5 wins) 26 d3! (intending f4) should be decisive.
23 g6 e5
On 23...e6 24 gxf7+ xf7 (if 24... xf7 25 xe6) 25 xg7 xg7 26 g1+ h7 27 g2 e5 28 g6+ h8 29 g5 g7 30 xh5+ g8 31 xe6+ f8 32 f5+ e7 33 f7+ wins. 24 gxf7+ f8
25 e3 d5!
A desperate bid for freedom. On 25...a4 (if 25... d8 26 h6) 26 xd6+ e7 27 d8+! xd8 28 xd8+ e8 29 c5+ mates. 26 exd5! ... Not 26 xd5 xc2! 26 ... xf7 On 26...a4 27 d6! axb3 28 dxc7 wins.
27 d6 f6
On 27... d7 White can either regain the exchange with 28 e6 or try for more with 28 h6. And on 27... xf3 28 d7, threatening d6 mate.
28 g5 b7
On 28... d7 29 d5! f7 (if 29... f7 30 e7+!) 30 xf6 wins material. 29 xf6 xf6
30 d7 d8
31 d6+ ... A mistake! 31 h6+! forces mate in three. 31 ... Black resigns
3 Petrosian [ U.S.S.R. ] - Fischer
PORTOROZ 1958
KING's INDIAN DEFENSE
Bear hug In what appear to be perfectly equal positions, Petrosian consistently finds seemingly innocuous moves which gradually overwhelm his opponent. He accomplishes his objective simply by exchanging pieces and maneuvering for victory without taking unnecessary risks. This essentially defensive technique has the virtue, when it doesn't utterly succeed, of producing a draw. Fischer, by contrast, generally chooses the sharpest course, however precipitous it may become. Occasionally he overreaches himself, but it makes for interesting chess. In this game, replete with errors on both sides, Petrosian succeeds in pinning his opponent for a time to a static endgame. But Fischer manages to burst his bonds, only to blunder on the very next move (51... d6). Petrosian, however, by blundering in his turn, restores the balance. The ensuing Rook and Pawn ending produces a thrilling draw.
1 c4 f6
2 c3 g6
3 g3 g7
4 g2 O-O
5 f3 d6
6 O-O c6
7 d3 ...
On 7 d4 I intended 7...e5. Petrosian is striving for an English Opening formation, a slow system for which he is temperamentally suited. 7 ... h5
8 d4 ...
Reckoning he can afford this loss of time in view of Black's misplaced KN. On 8 b1 f5! 9 c2 a5 10 a3 f4 (Petrosian-Vasiukov, Moscow 1956) Black obtains an excellent aggressive setup. I was as impressed by that game as Petrosian must have been, since he got crushed. 8 ... e5
9 d5 ...
9 dxe5 dxe5 10 xd8 xd8 11 d5 d7 12 h3 f5 13 g4 f6! If 14 gxf5 (14 xf6+ xf6 15 gxf5 gxf5 16 xf5?? g7+ wins) 14... xd5 15 cxd5 xd5. 9 ... e7
10 e4 ...
This is the right time to get in 10...c5! Petrosian-Boleslavsky, USSR Championship prelims 1957, continued: 11 e1 h8 12 d3 f5 13 b1 f6=. 10 ... f5 11 exf5 gxf5 Tempting but unsound is 11... xf5 12 g4 d4 13 gxh5 g4 14 xd4! xd1 15 e6, etc. And on 11... xf5 12 g5 d7 13 e6! xe6 14 dxe6 xe6 15 xb7 ab8 16 g2 xc4 17 d5! White comes out on top. 12 xe5! xg3 A "desperado" combination: this Knight (which is doomed anyway) sells its life as dearly as possible. 13 hxg3 ... Simple and good. I had expected 13 fxg3, but Petrosian eschews the K- side attack and plays for control of the center squares instead. His judgment turns out to be right. 13 ... xe5?
13...dxe5, keeping a fluid Pawn center, offers more play. I was unduly
worried about White's passed d-Pawn after 14 c5. 14 f4! g7
15 e3 d7
16 d4 ...
Forcing the trade of Black's most active piece. White soon obtains a firm grip on the position. 16 ... g6 17 e1? ... A careless transposition. Now by 17... xd4+ 18 xd4 h5! followed by ...h4, Black could exchange his isolated h-Pawn for White's g-Pawn and the game would be dead equal. Correct was 17 f3. 17 ... f7? 18 f3! ... Black doesn't get a second chance. 18 ... f8
19 f2 e8
20 xe8 xe8 21 xg7 xg7
22 d4 b6
23 h1 ...
White has effortlessly achieved a plus and now he wants to improve his position before embarking on a committal course. 23 b4!, threatening c5, is much sharper, and poses more immediate problems. 23 ... a5 My first free breath!
24 d1 f8
25 e3 ...
Petrosian keeps building without getting sidetracked - even by good moves. I was more afraid of 25 h5! tying me up completely. Then the Rook can't move because of xg6 followed by a check on h8. 25 ... f7!
26 b3 g7
The exchange of Queens eases the cramp. White can't afford to retreat and cede this important diagonal. 27 xg7+ xg7
28 a3 f8
29 e2 ...
White constantly finds ways to improve his position. Not 29 b4 axb4 30 axb4 a8 and Black seizes the open file. 29 ... e7
30 d3 h6
31 h5 e8
32 h2 ...
Avoiding a little trap: 32 xf5+? (or 32 xf5? h8!) 32... xf5 33 xf5 h8! followed by ... g6 winning the exchange. 32 ... d7
33 h1 h8
34 c2! ... Headed for an even stronger post on d4. I was amazed during the game. Each time Petrosian achieved a good position, he managed to maneuver into a better one. 34 ... f6
35 d4 g7
36 e2 ...
Feigning an invasion with h5 and e1 and e6. White has two wings to operate on: Black must be flexed to react appropriately, and this requires alertness. 36 ... g8? Panicking and giving him the opportunity he's been waiting for to sneak b4 in at a moment when Black can't counter with ...axb4 and ... a8. Petrosian likes to play cat-and-mouse, hoping that his opponents will go wrong in the absence of a direct threat. The amazing thing is - they usually do! Witness a case in point. I should just have ignored his "threat" with, say, 36... a8 37 h5 c8 38 e1 f6 and if 39 e6 c6. 37 b4! f6 38 d3! ... 38 bxa5 e4+ 39 g2 bxa5 40 b1 c5 holds. 38 ... axb4
38... e4+? 39 xe4 fxe4 40 bxa5 bxa5 (if 40... a8 41 axb6 cxb6 42
b1) 41 b1 followed by b7 wins easily. White also invades after 38... g6 39 bxa5 bxa5 40 b1. 39 axb4 g6 40 a1! ... White has finally achieved his ideal setup, but Black's game is still tenable. 40 ... g4+
41 e2 e8+
42 d2 f6
43 a6 ...
43 a7 c8 transposes to the game.
43 ... b8
44 a7 c8
45 c5! ... This Pawn sac caught me completely by surprise. It's the only line that gives Black any trouble. 45 ... bxc5 Not 45... xd5? 46 c6. 46 bxc5 dxc5 47 f3! f7!
47... xd5 loses to 48 e5+.
48 e5+ e7 49 xd7 xd7 50 xf5 f8!
51 g4 ...
51 xd7 xd7 52 e3 (if 52 a6 g8) 52... d6 53 a6+ xd5 54 xh6 e8+ 55 f3 c4 should draw. 51 ... d6? Should be the losing move! Correct is 51... f6! 52 e6 xd5! 53 xd5 xf4 (53... d8 also draws) winning the last Pawn and forcing a draw. 52 xd7! xd7
53 e3 e8+
On 53...c4 54 a6 wins. The idea is to force his King to the K-side, away from the passed c-Pawn.

Not 54 d3 g8. 54 ... d6 55 a6+ xd5 56 xh6 c4 57 h1? ... As Petrosian points out in the Russian bulletins of the tournament, White can win with the following line: "57 h7! c6 58 d7+ c5 59 d1 c3 60 g5 c4 61 g6 c2 62 c1 c3 63 f5 g8 64 f4 d2 65 xc2+ xc2 66 g5 c5 67 f6 c4 68 f7 xg6+ 69 xg6 c3 70 f8= ." White is a tempo ahead of the game, where Black's Pawn succeeds in reaching c2, instead of c3 (as here). What if Black tries to improve? For example, after 57 h7 c5 58 d7+ e6 59 d1 b8. Now there are two main lines: A] 60 g5? c3 61 g4 (if 61 c1 f5 62 xc3 c4! 63 xc4 b3+ with a draw by blockade although two Pawns down) 61... b4! 62 e1+ f7

4 Pilnik [ Argentina ] - Fischer
MAR DEL PLATA 1959
SICILIAN DEFENSE
Tact and tactics The presence in Argentina of Pilnik, Najdorf, and Eliskases, who chose to remain there after participating in the Buenos Aires chess Olympic of 1939, created a chess renaissance, as attested by the annual event at Mar del Plata which, though not lavish with prizes, offers an exotic vacation and attracts the world's best. Fischer tied for 3-4 with Ivkov, a mere half point behind Pachman and Najdorf in a strong field of fifteen. After a lackluster opening by both sides, and a middle game that, with the exception of 26... bxa3 can scarcely be described as more than routine, Fischer pilots the game into an even ending. Both he and Pilnik then proceed to complicate; but the latter is drawn into making a false lead, which Fischer exploits by obtaining a passed center Pawn. From this point on, although Pilnik does all that can be done to stave off the inevitable, Fischer is not gulled into making a single wrong step.

I figured if he didn't take it off last move he wouldn't take it now; so I wanted to build a little more and keep the option of moving the Knight to a4 as well as c4. But Black should pounce on the chance to play 14... c4! 15 xc4 bxc4 16 b6 (if 16 a1 ab8 17 b1 b7 is strong; or 16 c1 ab8 17 a4 c3! 18 bxc3? c6 19 b6 d8) 16... c8 17 a5 d7! and White's in trouble. E.g., 18 d5 (or if 18 e3 d8 19 d5 xd5 20 xd5 f6 winning at least the exchange) 18... xd5 19 xd5 (if 19 exd5 xb6 20 xb6 d8 21 b4 b8 22 a3 xa5 23 xa5 xb2)

5 Fischer - Rossetto [ Argentina ]
MAR DEL PLATA 1959
SICILIAN DEFENSE
The unpleasant obligation This game exemplifies most dramatically the German expression zugzwang. Unable to achieve any workable advantage from the opening or mid-game, Fischer embarks on an equally unpromising ending. He manages, however, after 19 d5, to acquire a Bishop against a Knight. Subsequently he employs an unusual Rook maneuver along the third rank (24 a3) in order to make spatial inroads. Rossetto unwittingly co-operates and soon is faced by a rare predicament: although material is equal, any move he makes must disturb the precarious balance and hasten his own disaster. That is zugzwang - and, appropriately, Rossetto resigns.

A Spielmann-Tartakover game proceeded: 7... e7 8 e2 O-O 9 O-O d6 10 e3 bd7 11 c1 b6 12 b4! b7 13 f3 ac8 14 e1 b8 15 f2 "with a beautiful position for White."

An unexpected reply which throws Black, unjustifiably, into a state of confusion. 19 ... xd5 Caught by surprise. Rossetto fails to find the most accurate reply: 19... e5!

Black should never allow c5 without first forcing White to make the concession of exchanging the Bishop for the Knight. 24 a3! ... The threat is simply 25 xd7. The veiled and seemingly insignificant attack on Black's a-Pawn is the means of forcing him to drop the protection of his c5 square. 24 ... b8 Forced. On 24... f6 25 c6 wins a Pawn. The only other try is 24...a5 25 bxa5 bxa5 26 c6! c5 (on 26... b8 27 b5! or 26... b6 27 b1! xc4? 28 c3 d2 29 b2 traps the Knight) 27 xa5 and White should win. 25 c5! bxc5 On 25...b5 26 b3 f7 27 c6 c7 28 a5! f7 29 a4 bxa4 30 xa4 e7 31 c4 picks off the a-Pawn. 26 bxc5 dxc5 27 xc5 g7 On 27... d7 (if 27... c8 28 ac3 keeps the bind) 28 c7 f6 29 b3 h8 30 xa6 xd5 31 xd5 xd5 32 aa7 wins. Black's game collapses once the heavy guns penetrate.
28 b3 f7
29 d6! d7 The Pawn is obviously immune. So Black attempts to revive his Knight.

say 37... e8, 38 c8= +.
6 Fischer - Shocron [ Argentina ]
MAR DEL PLATA 1959
RUY LOPEZ
A small oversight Fischer's opening repertoire has been less extensive than most practicing Grandmasters', yet his contributions to theory have been numerous. 20 g5!? is one of his innovations. However, it is not responsible for Shocron's defeat. Neither is Shocron's response; in retrospect, his system of defense seems surprisingly adequate. Nevertheless, after defending sensibly, Shocron outfoxes himself. Thinking he has seen one move further than his adversary, he provokes a combination. But his vision is one move short. In consequence, though otherwise it had withstood all of Fischer's assaults, his game crumbles.

13 f1 fe8
14 e3 g6
The Yugoslav System, popularized by Gligorich and Matanovich. The idea is to strengthen the position, and transfer the Bishop to f8 while awaiting further developments. Black will undertake specific counteraction only after White commits himself. 15 dxe5 ... This positional approach bares the hole on d5, so that White may gain access to it with his Knight. Alternate plans ensue after 15 d2 f8 and now: A] The quiet 16 c1 g7? (after 16... c6 17 d5! a5 [on 17... d8 18 c4! robs Black of his normal counterplay with ...c4, Olafsson-Ivkov, Buenos Aires 1960, and now White can leisurely build up a strong attack with h2, g4, g1 and later the stock sac f5] 18 b4 b7 19 a4 with a slight advantage) 17 b4 c6 18 d5! xd5 19 exd5 e7 20 dxc5 xd5 (if 20...dxc5 21 e3 d6 22 xc5 xd5 23 b3!) 21 b3 f6 (if 21... c6 22 g5!) 22 cxd6 xd6 23 g5! f8 24 e3 xd1 25 exd1 h6 26 e4! xe4 27 xd7 ac8 28 c4 g5 29 xg5 hxg5 30 c5 Black resigns. (Fischer-Rinaldo, US Open 1957.) B] The sharp 16 b4 cxb4 17 cxb4 c4 18 xc4 bxc4 19 c1 exd4 20 xd4 d5 (not 20...c3 21 b3 xe4 22 xe4! xe4 23 f3 c6 24 xc3 wins) 21 exd5 xe1+? (better is 21... d6) 22 xe1 d6. (Fischer- Matanovich, Bled 1961.) And now, as Keres pointed out, White can retain his extra Pawn with 23 f3! Not 23... xd5? 24 c3! wins a piece. Or 23... xd5 24 e4. 15 ... dxe5
16 h2 ...
When examined microscopically, Black has his problems. The hole on d5 might be described as "gaping". 16 ... ad8
17 f3 e6
On 17...h5? 18 d5! xd5 19 exd5 Black's K-side is weakened. 18 hg4 xg4 19 hxg4 ... Black has a new burden: neutralizing the potential attack along the open h-file. 19 ... c6 20 g5!? ... The old line 20 g3 f6 (better is 20... f6) 21 g5! is good for White. (Boleslavsky-Tal, USSR 1957.) I'd always thought my line was an improvement (the idea is to clear g4 for the Knight before Black can force an exchange with ... c4) but a closer look at this game shows that Black may have resources. 20 ... c4
20... xg5 puts White's concept to the crucial test. After 21 d5! xc1
(21... xd5 22 xg5 wins the exchange) 22 f6+ h8! (if 22... f8 23 axc1 e7 24 xh7+ g8 25 cd1! a8 [25... xd1 26 f6+ g7 27 xd1 b7 28 g4! followed by g5 with a strong attack] 26 f6+ g7 27 d5 xd5 28 xd5 White's better) 23 axc1 (23 xe8 g5 24 f6 c4! Black has good play for the exchange) 23... f8 (not 23... e7 24 g3 threatening either xe5 or h4) 24 g3 c7! 25 g5 g7 and now White can force a draw with 26 h5+, etc., or try for more with either
26 f4 or e3.
21 g4 xg4
Black can't allow f6+. As a consequence, White obtains the Bishop pair and attacking prospects along the open h-file. 22 xg4 b6! To prevent a4 and, as will be seen, to swing the Knight to f8 in order to defend the vulnerable h7 Pawn. For Unzicker's 22...f6 see game 10.
23 g3 c4!
The right timing. He's careful to see that a4 is restrained. Wrong, for example, is 23... d7 24 a4 b4 25 cxb4 cxb4 26 b3! and this Bishop comes crashing back into the game via the open diagonal.

37 a4 b8
38 c6 d8?
Up to here Shocron has defended coolly, but now he makes a fatal miscalculation. Correct is 38... d7! and it's not clear how White can improve his position any further. If 39 h2 (not 39 xc4 d3! 40 c6 b1 with a strong attack) 39... b1! 40 b6 (if 40 xc4 d3 41 c8+ g7 42 h4 xg5! 43 xg5 h1+! 44 xh1 f1+ with a perpetual)
40... d3 41 xb1 (not 41 xe6? f1!) 41... xb1 42 d7 c7! (on 42...
c5 43 c6 followed by d5 should win) 43 c6 d3! with drawing chances. 39 xe6! c8! Blow for blow! Apparently Shocron was prepared for this trick, having seen that 39...fxe6? 40 xe6+ f8 41 xe5 is crushing. Now how does White avoid losing material? 40 d7! Black resigns This is the shot he overlooked. On 40... xd7 41 xg6+ wins his Queen.
7 Olafsson [ Iceland ] - Fischer
ZURICH 1959
KING's INDIAN DEFENSE
Pride goeth Miscalculating, as he explains in his notes, Fischer rapidly gets into trouble and is thrown on the defensive. Olafsson quietly strengthens his attacking prospects and seems well on the road to victory. But he tries, prematurely, to force the issue (21 b1) and, as the game opens up, loses the initiative, although he seems to be blissfully unaware of it. He fails to foresee the power of the riposte to his 24 d2. Still blind to the danger, while seeking a forced win, he misses several opportunities to equalize. In extreme time pressure, he is compelled to exchange Queens under particularly unfavorable circumstances. The resulting endgame holds no further surprises.

Steinitz automatically gave this pin a question mark. Since there is no real threat involved (because the Bishop is worth more than the Knight) Black can now gain time by kicking it around.

8 Fischer - Keres [ U.S.S.R. ]
ZURICH 1959
RUY LOPEZ
Meat and potatoes Alekhine said, in his prime, that to wrest a point from him it was necessary to win the same game three times: once at the beginning, once in the middle, once at the end. No less a tribute may be paid to Keres. Each phase of this game is fascinating and hard-fought. Even the errors, and there are more than a few, contribute to making it an unusually complete exhibition of two master craftsmen using all the tools of their trade. While perhaps unglamorous, there is meat here, and potatoes too. And it is likely that as a result of this victory Fischer came to be regarded as a serious contender by the leading Soviet Grandmasters - this was the first time he had defeated one.

9 Walther [ Switzerland ] - Fischer
ZURICH 1959
SICILIAN DEFENSE
Betwixt the cup and the lip Here, against a minor European master, Fischer appears to be busted after seventeen moves, and admits he was ready to resign on move 36. Nevertheless, he extracts a miraculous draw from a hopeless ending, two Pawns down. Time and again Walther fumbles, allowing Fischer to prolong the struggle until he gets his break on move 54. What makes this game memorable is the demonstration it affords of the way in which a Grandmaster redeems himself after having started like a duffer; and how a weaker opponent, after masterfully building a winning position, often lacks the technique required to administer the coup de grâce. As Capablanca remarked, "The good player is always lucky."

At the risk of repeating myself, 13 a3 is mandatory. 13 ... c8? The disadvantage of this move is that Black loses his option of Q-side castling. Right is 13...b4 14 ce2 g6! 15 g4 e5 16 b3 d5 17 d2 O-O with initiative.

ZURICH 1959
RUY LOPEZ
Milking the cow The Ruy Lopez has been so extensively analyzed that often both players reel off their first twenty moves in two minutes flat. Nevertheless, it gives rise to situations that call for tact and patience. As Bronstein remarked, "When you play the Ruy, it's like milking a cow." Fischer, here, milks the cow to a fare-thee-well. The first twenty-two moves are identical with game number 6. Unzicker then varies with the dubious ...f6, which undermines his e-Pawn and leaves him with weak squares. Retribution, though not swift, is sure. Creating simultaneous threats on both wings, Fischer finally infiltrates on the a-file. Black is so tied up that he cannot defend one of his Pawns when attacked - making defeat imminent.

CANDIDATES' TOURNAMENT 1959
SICILIAN DEFENSE
Unheard melodies Paul Morphy is the idol of all the romantics who pine for the swashbuckling chess of yesteryear; but it is rarely possible to succeed with that kind of flamboyance any longer since players now are more evenly matched. A rise in the standard of defense has necessitated a corresponding adjustment in the character of attack. In modern chess most of the beauty resides in the annotations. Brilliancies often exist only as grace notes - because the opposition anticipates and thwarts them with appropriate rejoinders. To the uninitiated, some of the most hard-fought struggles seem devoid of all bravura. That is the situation in this game. Confronted with a dozen beautiful outlandish losing variations, Benko chooses what appears to be a prosaic one. Is this "ugliness" not a by-product of skill? Though the reader may feel cheated, and the winner frustrated, does it not argue for the perspicacity of the loser who sidestepped those seductive invitations?

Gligorich suggests simply 13... b7. Also satisfactory is 13... xb3! 14 axb3 b7 (or 14...b4) 15 h5 h8=. The text exposes Black to a vicious attack. 14 e5! ... 14 ... dxe5 A] It's too late now for 14... xb3 15 exf6 gxf6 (if 15... xf6 16 ce4) 16 h6, etc. B] 14...bxc3 15 exf6 xf6 (if 15...gxf6 16 h6 f5 17 h5 threatening to bring the Queen to g3) 16 xf6 gxf6 17 e4! f5 18 xd6 g6 19 f3 with a decisive attack (YUDOVICH).

12 Gligorich [ Yugoslavia ] - Fischer
CANDIDATES' TOURNAMENT 1959
SICILIAN DEFENSE
Castling into it Although not perfect, this is perhaps the most bitterly contested game in this book. Fischer chooses a difficult variation which requires Olympian judgment. He submits his King to an attack which, on the face of it, can only be described as irresistible. Why did he do it? Because, we are told, it was strategically justified. Gligorich, too, must be given equal credit for his courage and restraint. His continuation, despite intensive post-mortem analysis, has yet to be improved upon. The complexity of each phase of this tumultuous struggle must be studied to be believed. Curiously, in the "barren" Rook and Pawn ending, Gligorich somehow missed a win - a fact which he is probably unaware of to this day.

Gligorich and I have a standing feud with this position, which wes've reached no less than three times. I've lost twice and drawn once (this one). 11 xf6 ... Interesting is 11 g2 b7 12 he1 b4 13 d5!? exd5 14 exd5 f8 15 f5 e8 and Black won. (Bernstein-Fischer, US Championship 1957-8) 11 ... gxf6!? For 11... xf6 see game 9.
12 f5 ...
Giving up e5 in order to exert pressure on e6. Our game at Zurich 1959 continued: 12 g2 b7 13 he1 O-O-O 14 a3 b6=. In the US Championship 1959-60, Mednis played 12 a3 against me. The game went 12... b7 (12... b8 is sharper) 13 f5 e5 14 de2 b6 15 d5 xd5 16 exd5 c8 17 c3 c4 18 xc4 bxc4 19 b1 b8 20 a2 with a better game for White.

f8 18 xe4 xe4 19 xe4 xe4 20 e6+ xf7 21 xc7 a7 is exciting but equal. (Padevsky-Evans, Havana Olympic 1966.) 12 ... e5 Simagin gave this a "?" and proceeded to analyze the alternative 12... b4 13 fxe6 bxc3 (if 13... e5 14 d5!) 14 exd7+ xd7 15 e5, etc. By this logic, the whole variation is unsound for Black. We shall see.
13 h3 O-O!
Not 13... d7 14 g5! fxg5 (if 14...exf5 15 d5) 15 fxe6 fxe6 16 xe6 and Black's game collapses. Petrosian and Tal both happened to stroll by the board at this instant. Petrosian made a wry face which looked to me like "Can Black do this and live?" Black's "ugly" defense is based on sound positional considerations: once he can consolidate, there is a strong potential in the two Bishops coupled with his beautifully posted Knight and compact Pawn mass. These assets, in the long run, hopefully, should outweigh the temporary weakness of his King and the immobile target on e6. 14 ce2! ... The consistent strategical plan. Gligorich intends f4, bringing additional pressure to bear on e6. Simagin gave the offhand 14 h6 h8 15 g5! and "wins". It is incredibly naïve to imagine that a player of Gligorich's caliber could overlook such a simple refutation. In this line simply 15... g8! refutes White's strategy. 16 g6 (if 16 gxf6 g4 regains the Pawn with advantage) 16...fxg6 17 xe6 (weaker is 17 fxe6 b7)
17... xe6 18 fxe6 ac8 19 d2 (if 19 a3 d5! 20 exd5 xa3) 19... c4 20
xc4 (if 20 d4 a5) 20... xc4 21 d5 ge8 threatening ... f8 (or ... b4). In a sense my judgment was vindicated when Bronstein (as Black) reached the diagram against Kholmov in the 1964 USSR Championship. The continuation was 14 g5!? b4? (Kholmov gives the best defense: "14...fxg5! 15 fxe6 fxe6 16 xe6 d7 17 d5 xe6 18 xe6+ xe6 19 xe7+ f7 20 f5=") 15 gxf6 xf6 16 g1+ h8 17 h6 e7 18 c6!! xc6 19 e5!! and White won brilliantly. 14 ... h8
14... b7 also comes into serious consideration.
Unsound is 14... d7 15 f4 c8 16 h6 h8 17 h5 g8 18 xf6 g7 19 e2 d8 20 g5, etc.
15 f4 g8
16 g1 ...
Gligorich gives 16 e2 as correct. After 16... b7 17 fxe6 fxe6 it's anybody's game. On 16 fxe6 fxe6 17 dxe6 xe6 (or ... a5 or ... b7) 18 xe6 c8=. 16 ... d5! Suddenly the game opens up! But more prudent is 16... b7 and if 17 e1 b6! 17 fxe6 ... Weak is 17 exd5? exf5! and White can't recapture because of the pin on the g-file. 17 ... dxe4
18 d5 c5
Black's game hangs by a hair. 19 exf7 xf7 20 xe7 xe7 is roughly even. 19 xe7 ... Weird complications result from the key line 19 f5!: A) 19... d8 20 h6! (not 20 g3 fxe6 or 20 e7 xf5 21 exd8= axd8) 20... g6 21 f4! d3+ 22 xd3! wins. B) 19... xg1 20 fxe7 xe6 (if 20... xg4 21 xg4 xg4 22 c7 b8 23 d8+ g7 24 f5+ g6 25 e7 wins) 21 xg8 (if 21 xf6 g7)
21... xg4 22 h6 xd1 23 gxf6 g6 24 xg6 hxg6 25 xd1 with
winning chances. 19 ... xe7
20 f5 ...
If 20 e3 b7 21 exf7 xf7 Black wins a Pawn. 20 ... xe6
21 h6 ...
Possibly Gligorich had originally intended 21 d6? xa2 22 h6 overlooking that Black can win with 22... a1+ (if 22... xf5 23 xf6+ g7 24 d8+ leads to a draw by perpetual) 23 d2 f3+ 24 e3 (if 24 e2?? e1 mate; or 24 c3? a5+ 25 b3 a4+ 26 c3 b4+ 27 c4 e6+ leads to mate) 24... xb2! wins. 21 ... d7! Defending against the powerful threat of d8! Not 21... xg4? 22 xg4! xg4 23 d8+ g8 24 g7 mate.
22 d6 ...
White has no choice. Black threatened ... g6 followed by ... xa2. Or on 22 b1 xg4. 22 ... xg4! 23 xg4 ... Forced. 23 xe6? xh6 wins a piece. 23 ... xf5 24 xg8+? ... Handing Black the game on a silver platter. Correct is 24 f4 g5 25 xf6+ xf6 26 dxf6 e3! 27 xf7 g1! 28 xd7 e2 29 d1! exd1= + 30 xd1 g7 31 e1 f8 32 xf8 xf8 33 f2 with good drawing prospects. Black has two ways to recapture: which one is correct? 24 ... xg8? Returning the compliment! The winning line is 24... xg8! 25 xf6 e5 with an extra Pawn and a dominating position (if 26 xa6? xa6 27 xa6 f4+ wins a piece). 25 xf6 d5 26 d6! f5 On 26... b7? 27 f6+ g7 28 d8+ g8 29 xd7 wins.

Playing, as Dr. Tarrasch wryly put it, "for the loss." Nowadays I would know better than to try to squeeze a win out of such a simplified ending. 34 e5! ...

After the game Olafsson scolded me: "How can you play an ending like this so fast?" (I'd only been taking a few seconds a move for the last dozen moves or so.) "Because there's no danger. It's a dead draw," I replied. Had I known then what I know now, I would have selected 52... h5 and if 53 c5 xc5 54 xc5 c7 55 xb5 b7 holding the opposition, with a book draw. 53 xb5? ... Now it's Gligorich's turn to let me out. As Olafsson showed me, White can win with 53 c7+! It's hard to believe. I stayed up all night analyzing, finally convincing myself and, incidentally, learning a lot about Rook and Pawn endings in the process. Gligorich failed to point it out in his notes to the Bled tournament book. The main point is Black cannot get his King in front of the Pawn. A sample line is 53 c7+! d6 (if 53... d8 54 c5 d7 55 b7! d6 56 xb5) 54 c6+ d7 (if 54... d5 55 xb5 b8+ 56 b6) 55 xb5 b8+ (if 55... h4 56 c1 h8 57 a6) 56 b6 h8 57 b7+ c8

13 Fischer - Gligorich [ Yugoslavia ]
CANDIDATES' TOURNAMENT 1959
SICILIAN DEFENSE
Something new During the mid-fifties, Gligorich, Reshevsky, and Najdorf were considered the strongest non-Soviet Grandmasters. Within a few years Fischer managed to surpass them. However, in so doing, he succeeded in beating Gligorich only once - up to 1966 (see game 56). On the occasion of this first win, Fischer employs a novel attacking system (13 e2) against the Dragon Variation. Gligorich fails to react vigorously enough and makes the mistake of castling too soon, thereby exposing himself to the same type of sacrificial combination that demolished Larsen in game 2.

13 e2!? ... A totally new idea at the time. 13 xc4 xc4 14 g4 was the usual, and good, procedure. The text permits Black to capture what was considered, then, to be the more important of the White Bishops. Bronstein was so impressed with this concept that he enthusiastically gave my thirteenth move "!!" claiming it was virtually the winning line. Alexander Kotov, the commissar of chess criticism in the Soviet Union, wrote, with more sober restraint: "It is difficult to agree with this." 13 ... xe3 Not 13... c7? 14 db5. 14 xe3 O-O Reminiscent of game 12, it is now Gligorich who castles into it! At Mar del Plata 1960, Marini played against me the stronger 14... b6 (threatening ...e5) 15 d2 c5 16 f4 h5? (better is 16...b5 or ...O-O) 17 f3 h6 18 e5! with a powerful attack. Kotov recommends 14... a5 15 b1 (he gives only 15 g4? g5!) 15... c5 16 d3 a6 and Black's all right. So best is probably 15 f4 (after
14... a5) 15...O-O 16 h3 e6 but Black's two Bishops may offset the

On 23... 5c6 24 f5! exf5 25 xh5! gxh5 26 exf5 is crushing. Or if 23... 8c6? 24 a4 wins the exchange. Finally on 23... f8 24 f5! exf5 25 d5 d8 (if 25... fxe4 26 xe4 f5 27 xf5 wins a piece) 26 xh5! gxh5 (26... xd5 27 xd5 gxh5 28 exf5) 27 f6+ g7 28 h3 releases an avalanche. 24 xc3 ...

14 Keres [ U.S.S.R. ] - Fischer
CANDIDATES' TOURNAMENT 1959
SICILIAN DEFENSE
Too many cooks Professionals spend much of their spare time hunting for "cooks" with which they hope to surprise future opponents. It was rumored, for example, that Marshall waited for over ten years before springing his famous gambit on Capablanca, at New York, in 1918. But, as it happened, the wily Cuban refuted it over-the-board! Keres, in like manner, confronts Fischer with an innovation which the latter, in all innocence, proceeds to destroy. Rather than admit that his surprise Queen sacrifice is good for only a draw at best, Keres presses for more, offering material in order to sustain his initiative. Fischer continues to accept everything, but - at the very moment when victory is within his grasp (on move 31) - stumbles. Now he must win the game all over again; and he manages to do so, with an assist from Keres, in another twenty-two moves.

An innovation whose dubious merit appears on move 13. For 10 d3 see game 9. For 10 g4 see games 12 and 15. 10 ... b5 11 xf6 xf6 Not 11... xf6? 12 xb5!

The crux of Keres' prepared line. After 13 g3 dxe5 14 fxe5 d7 15 xg7 xe5 Black stands better. 13 ... xf3 So I chopped it off! 14 xf3 xf6 Not 14... c8? 15 fxe7 xe7 16 f5!

White seems to have fair prospects. But a Queen is a Queen! 20 ... h5! A hard move to find - even somewhat risky - over-the-board. Probably Keres had expected 20...g6 21 g4 g7 22 g5 h6 (if 22... d8 23 f6 xd4 24 e8 d8! 25 xd8 e3+ draws) 23 h4 hxg5 24 fxg5 d8 25 f6 xd4 26 e8 d8! 27 xd8 e3+ with a draw by perpetual.
21 f5 ...
To hinder ...g6. Kotov gives 21 b4 c8? (simply 21...g6 is more than sufficient; if then 22 xa6 c6) 22 c6! and wins. Zagoryansky also mistakenly thinks White has all the chances. He gives "21 e5! g6 (more passive is 21... c8 22 e7 a8 23 c6 f6 24 e6 f7 25 f5) 22 f5!" but 22... g7 23 f6+ h6 (if 24 g4 b4!) is quite satisfactory for Black. 21 ... h6!

15 Smyslov [ U.S.S.R. ] - Fischer
CANDIDATES' TOURNAMENT 1959
SICILIAN DEFENSE
A whopper Here is Fischer's first win against Vassily Smyslov; and it is hard to recall when the former world champion, conducting White, has been so badly outplayed. On move 13 of a crucial opening variation, Smyslov makes what appears to be a "lapsus manus." Rather than fight a prolonged uphill positional battle, he sacrifices a Pawn to try to regain the initiative. This proves to be a piece of bad judgment, since, basically, the loss of this Pawn alone brings about his demise. Defending with deadly precision, Fischer gradually consolidates - the shadow of his Pawn looming larger with each approach to the endgame. Smyslov thrashes about, striving desperately for complications, avoiding exchanges like the plague. But he is unable to get off the hook.

16 Fischer - Petrosian [ U.S.S.R. ]
CANDIDATES' TOURNAMENT 1959
CARO-KANN DEFENSE
Four Queens Fischer extracted a slight minus score from the seven games in which he was called upon to face the Caro-Kann, prompting Botvinnik to note: "Fischer's both strong and weak point lies in that he is always true to himself and plays the same way regardless of his partners or any external factor." This variation is not only complex and critical - but perilous. After a single slip the edge passes to Black. But Petrosian overestimates his position and, somewhat recklessly, dissipates his advantage. In time-pressure he misses a forced draw and Fischer regains the upper hand. From this point on, with four marauding Queens roaming the board, the play becomes "rich and strange" - resulting in a tortuous draw.

In our first round game here, Smyslov played 4... h5 5 exd5 cxd5 6 b5+ c6 7 g4 g6 8 e5 c8 9 d4 e6 10 h4 (correct is 10 e2! to prevent ...f6) 10...f6 11 xg6 hxg6 12 d3 f7 13 h5 gxh5 14 gxh5 ge7=. 5 xf3 f6 The old 5...e6 6 d4 dxe4 7 xe4 xd4 8 d3 gives White a good attack for the Pawn. And on 5...dxe4 6 xe4 d7 7 g5!? (better is simply 7 d4) 7... gf6 8 b3 e6 9 xb7 d5! Black gets good play. (Fischer-Cardoso, Portoroz 1958.) Inferior is 6 d4 dxe4 7 xe4!? (7 e3 bd7 8 xe4 xe4 9 xe4 f6

The critical juncture. In our earlier game (round two) Petrosian continued with 13...g5 14 f3? (Simagin gives 14 f4 gxf4 15 gxf4 e7
16 c4 d7 17 g4 "with advantage" but after 17...O-O-O 18 fxe5 b8

16... xd4 17 xd4 cxd4 18 ac1. Or 16...cxd4 17 h4 g8 18 hxg5 hxg5
19 fc1 O-O-O 20 b4! b8 21 b5 a5 22 d2 wins a Pawn) 17 e5! O-O-O 18 fe1. Now the Bishop diagonal is unblocked and Black can't set up a blockade on his e5, as in our first game. After 13...O-O 14 f4 h8 15 f5 g8 16 g4 f6 White has a tough nut to crack, but his initiative is permanent. The text indicates Petrosian's intention to castle long without trying to prevent f4.

I had expected 17...bxa3 18 fxe5 transposing to "B" above. 18 fxe5 fxe5 19 axb4 c7 Black wants to secure a Q-side blockade. The b-Pawn won't run away.

22 f2 g6

24... hf8 is still right. On 24...gxh5 25 xh5 hf8 26 f5!

27 c4 c3?
Continuing to underestimate the danger. Safer is 27... d6. 28 f1? ... Why didn't I play 28 f6! immediately? If then 28... df8 (28... hf8 29 f1! xf7 30 xd8+! c7 31 f7 wins) 29 xe5 xf7 30 xh8 c5
31 e5 - it's difficult for Black in view of his exposed King and White's

A good last-ditch try. Curiously, the King will be safer in White's territory where it obtains shelter from the cluster of Pawns. 39 f8? ... Right is 39 h2! immediately, preventing Black's King from reaching safety behind the lines. If then 39... f6 40 g5. Or 39... a1 (39... a2? 40 xa2 xa2 41 a8! wins a piece) 40 g7 wins the e-Pawn. Finally on 39... ae7 40 a8 renews the attack. 39 ... ae7 Forced, to defend against the threat of xe5+. Not 39... xf8 40 xf8+ b6 41 b4+ a6 (if 41... c7 42 e7+) 42 a3+ b7 43 xa7+ xa7 44 g5 and queens.
40 a8 ...
I thought this was it! The two Queens are closing in for the kill. 40 ... b4!
41 h2 b3!
Slippery as an eel! Now White sealed. It's fantastically complicated! The tournament bulletins suggest 42 c5 xc5 (if 42... g6 43 e2! gg5 44 d1+!) 43 g8+ a3 44 c2 b4 45 a8+ a4 (not 45... a4? 46 c1+ a2 47 g8+ b3 48 c2+! wins) 46 cxa4+ xa4 47 xc6 "with good winning chances," but after 47... c3 it's likely Black can draw.
42 a1 ...
After the game a kibitzer asked Petrosian if he thought 42 c5 would have won for White. Petrosian, who must have analyzed it for many hours (not knowing, of course, what my sealed move was), simply replied: "I don't know." 42 ... a3 The only move to stop mate on b2. 43 xa3+ xa3

Now White has to try to make do with the g-Pawn. 44 ... f7!

47 g3 ...
A gross oversight, but probably best anyway! White can't win anymore. If 47 g5 h4, etc. 47 ... xe4! 48 f2? ... Having overlooked Petrosian's last move, I was somewhat shaken! Not 48 dxe4? xe4+ 49 h4 xd2 50 g5 xf1 51 g6 d3 wins. Also on 48 d1+? (48 xc3+? dxc3 49 dxe4 c2 wins) 48... xd1 49 dxe4 e3 50 e2 xc4 51 g5 d6 52 g6 e8 and Black again wins. The right retort, however, is 48 g5! and it's still a hard fight. 48 ... h1! I offered a draw, afraid that he wouldn't accept. Black certainly has the edge now. If 49 g5 e4! Or if 49 g2 h6. After having fought so hard for the draw, however, Petrosian was obviously unprepared to readjust his frame of mind and start playing for a win. So... Drawn
17 Fischer - Tal [ U.S.S.R. ]
CANDIDATES' TOURNAMENT 1959
SICILIAN DEFENSE
A very near miss This is one of the four games that Fischer lost to Tal who, in winning this tournament, earned the right to meet and trounce Botvinnik for the world championship. In jest the whimsical Tal signed Fischer's name, in addition to his own, when asked for an autograph. "Why not?" he quipped; "I've beaten Bobby so often ... that gives me the right to sign for him!" A careful reading of Fischer's notes will reveal a clear echo of the strong emotions that engulfed him during this tense encounter. He misses a win in the opening and several draws along the way, demonstrating dramatically how a continuously advantageous position can abruptly be turned into defeat by seemingly insignificant miscalculations.

13 d5! ... A shot! 13 ... a7 "13...exd5 14 xd5 xf5 15 xf5 a7 16 xe4+ e7 17 xb4 e2 18 g5! xg5 19 xg5 xg5 20 xb8+ wins." (PANOV.) 14 xe4? ... Correct is 14 e3! c5 15 h5! g6 (if 15... xa4 16 xa7 exd5 17 ae1+) 16 ae1! and White's every piece is bearing down on Black's King
(KEVITZ).
14 ... exf5 15 xf5 ... Probably it's better to avoid exchanges with 15 d5 or 15 f3. 15 ... e7! A unique way of shielding the e-file. 16 xc8 xc8 17 f4? ... The right move is simply 17 c3! (not 17 xd6? xg2+ 18 xg2 e2+
19 f3 xd6 20 xe2 xc2+ wins) and if 17... c6 18 f2.
17 ... c6!
18 f3 xa4!
Such a surprise that I didn't dare believe my eyes! I had expected 18... xf3 19 xf3 e2 20 f2 xf2 21 xf2 and White has a slight edge after a3 because of Black's disconnected Pawns. 19 xd6 c6! Tal finds an inspired defense. 20 xb8 b6+ White remains a clear Pawn ahead after 20... xf3 21 xf3 g7 22 c3.
21 h1 xb8
The crowd was shouting and whistling with each move. Later I was informed that many sport fans were in the audience. Maybe some soccer match had been canceled. As a consequence chess was the main attraction that day in Belgrade. 22 c6+ ... Many annotators believed that 22 ae1 was the winning move. Tal himself confessed he thought Black was lost after that. But 22... d8! holds in all lines (not 22... g6? 23 xf7+ d7 24 d1+! d6 25 xd6+ xd6 26 f6+! wins). I've studied this position for ages, it seems, and the best I can find is 23 d1+ c7! (23... c8? 24 c6+ wins) 24 f4+ (if 24 d4 b7!) 24... b7 25 d6 c7 26 xb4+ c8 27 xa6 b7! 28 xb7+ xb7 29 af6 g7=. 22 ... d7 23 ae1+ ... Black holds after 23 ad1 d6 24 xf7 (if 24 f6 g6 25 dxd6? xd6!) 24... c7, etc. And on 23 xf7 d6. 23 ... e7 Finally Tal "develops" his Bishop. Not 23... d8 24 xf7! e7 25 fxe7 xe7 26 d1+ wins. 24 xf7 xf7 25 e6+ f8! I thought he had to go to g7, whereupon 26 xd7 wins easily. 26 xd7 ... Not 26 f1+ g7 27 f7+ h8 and if 28 xd7 d8 29 g4 e5 wins. 26 ... d6
27 b7 g6
Within a handful of moves the game has changed its complexion. Now it is White who must fight for the draw! 28 c3! ... Black's extra piece means less with each Pawn that's exchanged. 28 ... a5 On 28...bxc3 29 c8+ d8 30 xc3=. 29 c8+ ... On the wrong track. Right is 29 cxb4! xb4 (if 29...axb4 30 a3! bxa3 31 bxa3 xa3 draws) 30 f3+ g7 31 e2 draws, since Black can't possibly build up a winning K-side attack and his own King is too exposed. 29 ... g7
30 c4 d8
31 cxb4 axb4 On 31... xb4 32 e2 White should draw with best play. 32 g3? ... Creating losing chances. I don't see how Black can make any progress after 32 e4. If 32... c7 33 e7+ g8 34 e8+ f8 35 e4, etc. 32 ... c6+
33 e4 xc4
34 xc4 b6! I overlooked this. Now Black has winning chances. I had planned on a draw after 34... e7? 35 a3! dissolving Black's b-Pawn (35...b3 is answered by 36 c7 followed by b7).
35 g2 f6
36 f3 e5
37 e3 ...
37 a3 is met, as always, by ...b3. Once White can eliminate Black's b-
Pawn it's a theoretical draw. 37 ... g5+
38 e2 d5
39 d3 f6
White might be able to draw this ending, but it's an ugly defensive chore. 40 c2? ... Too passive. I wanted to avoid immobilizing my Q-side Pawns with 40 b3, but it's the best hope now. On 40... e7 41 d4+ preserves drawing chances. 40 ... e5
41 e2 f6
42 c2 f3+
43 e2 f7
44 d3 d4!
Little by little Tal inches his way in.
45 a3 ...
On 45 b3 f3+ 46 e2 f2+ 47 d3 xc2 48 xc2 e4 wins. 45 ... b3
46 c8 ...
Equally hopeless is 46 e2 (or 46 d2 f3+ 47 e2 f2+) 46... f3+
47 d2 xb2, etc.
46 ... xb2 47 d8+ c6

White resigns If 53 xc3 b1= +! The discovered-check theme is strangely reminiscent of the finale of game 31.
18 Spassky [ U.S.S.R. ] - Fischer
MAR DEL PLATA 1960
KING'S GAMBIT
Old wine in a new bottle Here is the second of the three losses contained in this volume. As in the previous example, Fischer misses a win by inches. Deviating from his cherished Sicilian, he enables Spassky to employ the King's Gambit - not quite believing he would. Spassky is one of the few Grandmasters who still does so in competition. Fischer promptly wins a Pawn and hangs on to it, but neglects to steer for a highly favorable ending (23... g3). Just four moves later, 27 e5! effects his undoing. Undaunted by this early setback, Fischer scored 121⁄2 out of his last 13, pulling neck and neck with Spassky for first.
1 e4 e5
2 f4 exf4
3 f3 g5
This loss spurred me to look for a "refutation" of the King's Gambit, which I published in the American Chess Quarterly, Vol. 1 (1961), No. 1. The right move is 3...d6!
4 h4 ...
The only realistic try for any advantage. There is no longer anything "romantic" about the Muzio Gambit, which has been analyzed to a draw after 4 c4 g4 5 O-O (if 5 e5 h4+ 6 f1 c6!) 5...gxf3 6 xf3 f6, etc. 4 ... g4
5 e5 f6
On 5...h5 6 c4 h7 7 d4 d6 8 d3 f3 9 gxf3 e7 10 e3 xh4+ 11 d2 g5 12 f4 h6 13 c3 White has more than enough compensation for the Pawn. This is vintage analysis.
6 d4 ...
On 6 c4 d5 7 exd5 g7 (the old 7... d6 is also adequate) is the modern panacea. And on 6 xg4 xe4 7 d3 g3 8 xf4 xh1 9 e2+ (9 g5 e7 10 e2 h5 11 e5 f6! 12 xf6+ f7 wins - Steinitz) 9... e7 10 f6+ d8 11 xc7+ xc7 12 d5+ d8 13 xe7 xe7 and Black should win. Morphy-Anderssen, Paris 1858. 6 ... d6
7 d3 xe4
8 xf4 g7 9 c3? ... After this White has no compensation for the Pawn. Better is 9 c3 e7
10 e2 f5. At least White keeps a grip on his f4 - for what that's
worth. 9 ... xc3 10 bxc3 c5 Immediately nibbling at White's center. Keres gives 10...O-O first.
11 e2 ...
On 11 e2+ e6 (12 d5? xc3+). 11 ... cxd4
12 O-O c6
It doesn't pay to be greedy with 12...h5. After 13 g5 f6 14 c1 followed by f4 Black's K-side is all messed up. 13 xg4 O-O 14 xc8 xc8
15 g4 f5
Winning a second Pawn, but creating a K-side weakness. Simply 15... h8 is stronger.
16 g3 dxc3
17 ae1 ... Black snatches the initiative after 17 xd6 f6 18 f4 g6. 17 ... h8 Also good is 17... d7 18 xd6 fe8 and if 19 c5 f7 (KMOCH). 18 h1? ... More accurate is 18 xd6 f6 (if 18... g8 19 e5!) 19 e5 xe5 20 xe5 with a little play left for White. 18 ... g8 On 18...d5 19 c5 creates problems. 19 xd6 f8! The key! On 19... d4 20 h2 g4 21 e5+! (to prevent Black from doubling Rooks on the g-file), 21... g8 (if 21... xe5 22 xe5 xh4? 23 f7+) 22 g3 holds. 20 e5+ xe5 21 xe5+ g7! Now White's h-Pawn must fall. 22 xf5 ... What else? On 22 xf5 (not 22 f4? d6 or 22 f4? g4) 22... xh4+ 23 g1 g4 forces a favorable exchange of Queens (if 24 f2 d6 produces a strong attack). 22 ... xh4+
23 g1 ...
23 ... g4? Drifting. Not realizing the danger, I thought Black could whip up an attack along the g-file. But correct is 23... g3! 24 xg3 (if 24 e2 d6)
24... xg3 (threatening 25... xd3 followed by ...c2) and White, a Pawn
down, has a tough ending to hold - as Spassky pointed out in our post- mortem analysis.
24 f2 e7
Threatening ... h4
25 e4 g5
I started to feel uncomfortable, but little did I imagine that Black's game would collapse in four short moves! I should have taken a draw by repetition with 25... d1+ 26 e1 g4 27 e4 d1+, etc. And if 28 h2 c6 29 b8+ g8 30 e5+ g7. 26 d4! ... This powerful centralization completely paralyzes Black. 26 ... f8? Overlooking White's real threat. I was worried about e5, not realizing it could be met successfully with ... c5. The right defense is
26... f8! 27 xa7 (if 27 e5 c5 28 f7+ g8 29 xg5 xd4 30
xd4 xg5) 27... d6=. 27 e5! ... I had reckoned on 27 e5? xf2 28 xf2 c5! 29 xc5 xg2 mate. Incredibly, Black must lose a piece. While trying to figure out what was going on in Spassky's head, I blundered and lost the game! 27 ... d8 Trying to squirm out! The Queen has no shelter. On 27... g6 28 xe7 wins. Or 27... h4 28 xf8+. Or 27... f6 28 d6!
28 e4 h4
I knew I was losing a piece, but just couldn't believe it. I had to play one more move to see if it was really true!
29 f4 Black resigns
On 29... g3 30 xe7 is most efficient.
19 Gudmundsson [ Iceland ] - Fischer
REYKJAVIK 1960
GRUENFELD DEFENSE
A long voyage home Illustrating, rather subtly, how a weaker player may be lured to his own destruction, Fischer entices his opponent to abandon his passive though solid attempts to settle for a draw. Wrongly convinced that he holds an advantage, Gudmundsson, with 16 e4, gives Fischer the opportunity to launch a long, unclear sacrificial combination. Gudmundsson makes matters unexpectedly easy with 24 b1, but the analysis accompanying the text shows the sacrifice to be sound in all variations. Fischer's performance from here on is typical in its clarity and forcefulness.
1 d4 f6
2 f3 ...
Solid but passive. 2 ... d5
3 e3 ...
Voluntarily locking in the Bishop lacks energy and reduces White's options. 3 ... g6
4 c4 ...
4 c3 would lead to the Colle System.
4 ... g7
5 c3 O-O
6 b3 ...
After 6 e2 c5! it's difficult for White to equalize: A] 7 O-O? cxd4 8 xd4 c6 9 cxd5 xd5 10 xd5 xd5 11 f3 c4 12 xc6 bxc6 and Black stands better. Aaron-Gligorich, Stockholm 1962. B] 7 cxd5 xd5 8 b3 xc3 9 bxc3 c7 10 O-O b6 11 a4 c6 again Black's better. Goglidze-Botvinnik, Moscow 1935. C] 7 dxc5 a5 8 cxd5 (if 8 O-O dxc4 9 xc4 xc5) 8... xd5 9 xd5 xc3+ 10 d2 (after 10 f1 g7 11 d2 c7 Black regains his Pawn at will, with a strong attack) 10... d8! 11 xc3 xc3+ 12 bxc3 xd5 with the superior ending (if 13 d1 xc5 14 d8+ g7 15 O-O c6 16 e8 b6). 6 ... e6 Another good build-up is 6...c6 followed by ...e6, ...b6, ... b7, ... bd7, ...c5, etc.
7 e2 c6
8 c2 ...
Probably best (Black threatened ... a5 winning the two Bishops). As Evans pointed out in Trophy Chess (in an analogous position): "8 cxd5 exd5 permits Black to solve the problem of his QB. He has the semi-open e-file and good squares for his pieces. It is now White who must fight for equality!" 8 ... dxc4 9 xc4 e5! 10 dxe5 ... Also good is 10 xe5 (if 10 d5? a5) 10... xe5 11 dxe5 g4 12 e6! (not 12 f4? xe5! 13 fxe5? h4+ 14 g3 xc4, etc.) 12... xe6 13 xe6 fxe6 14 O-O=. 10 ... g4
11 O-O ...
Stronger is 11 e6! xe6 12 xe6 fxe6 13 O-O (13 e4? ce5! 14 xe5? xf2! 15 c4 xe5 16 xe6+ f7 17 xe5 d3+ wins), and Black seems to have nothing better than a draw by perpetual after 13... xf3 14 gxf3 h4 15 fxg4 xg4+ 16 h1 f3+, etc. 11 ... cxe5 12 xe5 xe5
13 e2 c6
The chances are now equal.
14 f4 ...
Apparently stronger is 14 e4 but after 14... h4! 15 h3 (if 15 f4 g4)
15...g5! 16 f4 (or 16 d1 f5 17 f4 g6 18 fxg5 f4!) 16...gxf4 17 xf4
(on 17 xf4 g3) 17... h8 gives Black good prospects along the ventilated g-file. 14 ... g4!
15 h3 f5!
White was doubtlessly expecting 15... f6 16 e4 with an ideal center. 16 e4? ... Provoking a powerful combination. White should abandon his hopes in the center and settle for 16 b3 f6 17 xb7 e4! 18 xc6 c8 19 a6 xc3 20 bxc3 xc3 21 a3 xa1 22 xf8 d4! 23 exd4 xd4+ 24 h1 xf8. Black is better, but White has excellent drawing chances. 16 ... d4+
17 h1 f2+
18 xf2 ... All forced. Not 18 h2 xe4. 18 ... xf2 19 exf5 xc3! This clean-cut line reduces White's options. Inexact would be 19... fe8 20 e4! e1+ 21 h2 gxf5 (if 21... d4 22 e3! xa1 23 xd4) 22 g3 and if 22... d4? 23 e3! 20 bxc3 ae8
21 d3 e1+
22 h2 g1+
23 g3 fe8
Just as complicated is 23...gxf5 24 xf5 fe8 25 xh7+ g7 26 f5, etc. 24 b1? ... Also bad is 24 f2 8e3+! 25 xe3 xe3+ 26 xe3 xe3+. The toughest defense is 24 fxg6! hxg6 and now: A] 25 xg6? 1e2! (not 25... 8e2 26 xf7+ h8 27 f5 xg2+ 28 h4 f2+ 29 h5 f3+ 30 h6! and White wins!) 26 xf7+ h8 27 f5 xg2+ 28 h4 e1+ 29 h5 g7! (threatening 30... h8+) 30 xe8 xe8+ 31 h4 d8+ 32 g5+ xg5 33 fxg5 d1 with an easy win. B] 25 b1 8e3+! 26 xe3 (if 26 g4 h2 27 xe3 leads to the same) 26... xe3+ 27 g4 (not 27 h4? h2 28 f2 xh3+!) 27... h2
28 f2 (if 28 xg6 g3+ 29 h5 xf4! 30 f5 g3! 31 g4 g7 32
c1 [if 32 h4 xg4+ 33 hxg4 h2+ mates] 32... e3 wins), 28... xd3 (if 28... xh3!? 29 xg6! fxg6 30 h1! holds) 29 b2! (29 xb7 loses to
29... xh3! 30 b8+ h7 31 f5 h6!) 29... xc3 30 d2 and White has
drawing chances even though a Pawn behind. 24 ... gxf5 Threatening either .... h8 or .... 8e6 with a devastating check to follow on the g-file.
25 d2 ...
No better is 25 xf5 1e2 26 xh7+ h8 27 f5 xg2+ 28 h4 g7 (among others) wins. 25 ... xb1 26 xb1 xb1 27 xb1 e2 This is what Gudmundsson overlooked. If now 28 c1 e1 picks off one of the Bishops. So... White resigns
20 Fischer - Euwe [ Holland ]
LEIPZIG OLYMPIC 1960
CARO-KANN DEFENSE
Theoretical scuffle Former world champion, Dr. Max Euwe had for decades been considered one of the world's leading authorities on opening theory. His Chess Archives ranks with Modern Chess Openings as an indispensable source of reference. It is no small wonder, then, when he selects a risky but playable variation. Fischer, however, just a little better versed in its intricacies, introduces a nuance on move 15 which ruffles his opponent no end. Fischer's method of dispatching his veteran adversary - on home grounds, as it were - is deceptively simple. After a mere eighteen moves the opening has become an ending and the duel is over. Euwe fights on, but to no avail.

At that time I was convinced the Panov-Botvinnik attack was the sharpest. 4 ... f6

In our game at Buenos Aires 1960, Ivkov played 5...e6 6 f3 e7 7 c5 O-O 8 d3 b6 9 b4 bxc5 (better is 9...a5 10 a4 fd7!) 10 bxc5 c6 11 O-O d7 12 h3 e8 13 f4 with a bind.

16 O-O gives White good play against Black's isolated d-Pawn and a-
Pawn) 15 b4+ (15 e2+ f6 16 h4 wins, according to Evans) 15... e8 16 d4 with a clear advantage. 14 bxc3 d7 After 14... d5 15 xd5 exd5 16 b1 gives White a slight edge. 15 b1! ... The innovation. Months before the game I had shown this line to Benko and he suggested this innocent-looking move. Upon looking deeper I found that, horrible as White's Pawn structure may be, Black can't exploit it because he'll be unable to develop his K-side normally. It's the little quirks like this that could make life difficult for a chess machine. 15 ... d8? Also difficult is 15... xb5 16 xb5 d6! 17 b7 f6 18 e2 c6 19 f7 a5 20 e3 with an enduring pull.

Upon reconsideration, however, simply 34 e2 wins. It's these tidbits that you remember best.

21 Letelier [ Chile ] - Fischer
LEIPZIG OLYMPIC 1960
KING'S INDIAN DEFENSE
A Queen for the King Letelier transgresses opening principles by neglecting his development in order to win material. Pugnaciously, he mixes it up with the unorthodox 5 e5 and proceeds to snatch Pawns. But his judgment proves to be unwise. Striking from behind the lines, Fischer causes the overextended White center to crumble. Letelier, busily engaged on a material hunt, neglects to safeguard his rear, leaving his King marooned in the center. Fischer rapidly encircles the hapless monarch and, with a startling Queen sacrifice, induces abdication.
1 d4 f6
2 c4 g6
3 c3 g7
4 e4 O-O
5 e5 ...
Weak. Letelier snapped at the chance to take me "out of the book," but this premature advance leaves White with all the responsibility of holding his overextended center Pawns. 5 ... e8
6 f4 d6
Weaker is 6...c5 7 dxc5 a5 8 e3 f6? 9 f3 fxe5 10 fxe5 c6 11 e2 c7 12 O-O e6 13 d5 d8 14 d2 etc. (Koralev-Roshal, USSR
1962.)
7 e3 ...
7 f3 is safer, though White can no longer lay claim to any kind of
initiative. My game with Schoene in the US Junior Championship 1957 continued: 7...dxe5 8 fxe5 (better is 8 dxe5) 8... g4 9 e2 c5 10 f4 cxd4 11 xd4 c6 12 xd8 xd8 soon winning a Pawn. 7 ... c5! "Now the artificially constructed White center begins to crumble."
(LOMBARDY.)
8 dxc5 c6 "Black rapidly develops his pieces while White nurtures his own dreams with ill-gotten gains." (LOMBARDY.) 9 cxd6 ... White tries to compensate for his lack of development by continuing to snatch material. Instead he should be seeking to return the Pawn in the least damaging way (by keeping the lines closed). Better is 9 f3 g4 10 e2. 9 ... exd6
10 e4 ...
"More realistic would have been 10 f3." (LOMBARDY.) I intended 10... g4. After the text White no longer has time to castle. 10 ... f5! 11 g3? ... A better chance is 11 xd6 xd6 12 xd6 xd6 13 exd6 xb2 14 d1 b4! (threatening ... c2) 15 f2 (if 15 e2 c2 16 d2 d3+)
15... xa2 16 e2 (if 16 d2? c3!) 16...a5. Black is better but White
may have drawing resources. 11 ... e6 I also considered 11... c7 12 xf5 gxf5. White's center must collapse.
12 f3 ...
By now White is more than willing to return the Pawn in order to catch up in development. 12 ... c7 Also playable is 12...dxe5 13 xd8 xd8 14 c5 exf4. But I wanted to fracture him in the middle game.
13 b1 ...
Continuing his "attack". On 13 e2 dxe5 14 c5 a5+ 15 b4 xb4 16 xf8 xf8! 17 O-O exf4 18 e4 f5 is overwhelming. And on 13 c2 (in order to prepare O-O-O) 13...dxe5 14 f5 gxf5 15 xf5 b4 16 b3 (if
16 b1 xf5 17 xf5 d6 18 b1 xc4 19 g5 f5 20 e6 c6 21
xc4 xc4 22 xf8 xf8 with a winning attack) 16... xf5 17 xb4 f6! is strong. If 18 c5 b8 (threatening ... g4). 13 ... dxe5
14 f5 e4!
"An unexpected shot that sends White spinning." (LOMBARDY.) 15 fxe6 ... On 15 xe4 gxf5! 16 xf5? (if 16 h4 xb2) 16... a5+ wins a piece. 15 ... exf3 16 gxf3 f5! "The Pawn on e6 can be ignored in favor of the attack." (LOMBARDY.) The threat is ...f4.

22 Szabo [ Hungary ] - Fischer
LEIPZIG OLYMPIC 1960
KING'S INDIAN DEFENSE
Bad judgment Once a contender for the title, Szabo's performances nowadays are spotty and unpredictable. Here, with breathtaking bluntness, he attempts to wipe Fischer from the board. In the process he leaves himself wide open on the dark squares. Fischer promptly invades on the Q-side, by means of a curious Queen maneuver, while Szabo, preoccupied with his own K-side attack, fails to realize the danger in time. 21... e3! is the blow that ends all effective resistance. Rather than fight on against hopeless odds, Szabo resigns three moves later.

23 Fischer - Tal [ U.S.S.R. ]
LEIPZIG OLYMPIC 1960
FRENCH DEFENSE
No holds barred Their first encounter after Tal became world champion proves to be an old-fashioned slugfest. Typically aggressive, Fischer rapidly achieves a winning bind, but unwisely permits Tal to touch off "a dazzling array of fireworks" with 14... xe5! The struggle seesaws for seven moves before settling in a perpetual check. The quality of this confrontation left little doubt that, in time, Fischer would yet take Tal's measure. He did just that less than a year later, after Tal had lost his return match with Botvinnik (Game 32). Reading Tal's palm, Fischer predicted: "The next world champion will be ... Bobby Fischer!"

24 Fischer - Darga [ W.Germany ]
WEST BERLIN 1960
FRENCH DEFENSE
Asking for trouble The Winawer Variation has given Fischer consistent trouble. He has had the utmost difficulty cracking Black's tortoise-like shell; even his successes are unconvincing. Maintaining the same line of attack year after year has provided his opponents with ample opportunity to sharpen their defenses. Darga's 12...f6 obliges Fischer, in order to get something out of the opening, to speculate on a Pawn sacrifice (13 a3!?). Though Darga's reaction may not be ideal, he proceeds sensibly and equalizes. Underestimating Fischer's chances, however, he falls prey to a scintillating mid-game attack. And so, once again, by virtue of his native ability, Fischer avoids the retribution that is the usual price for failing to secure an advantage in the opening.

The sac may well have been unsound in that game. 13 ... fxe5 Mednis declined and castled, but after 14 e1! got a cramped game (14...fxe5 is answered by 15 xe5! keeping the e-file open). 14 dxe5 ...

25 Lombardy [ U.S.A. ] - Fischer
USA CHAMPIONSHIP 1960-1
SICILIAN DEFENSE
When the Maroczy didn't bind Geza Maroczy left a strange legacy: the discovery that a certain type of Pawn formation imposes a near-decisive cramp on the opponent. In this game, after Lombardy's sixth move, he obtains, with Fischer's consent, the dread "Maroczy bind." From here on, given a few developing moves, White's game almost plays itself - unless Black takes early and energetic counter-measures. This is easier said than done. The method that Fischer chooses to free himself (9...d5) involves the sacrifice of a Pawn. Lombardy reacts sluggishly, overlooking a neat tactical point (17... h4+) at the tail-end of a combination. Even so, he still has excellent drawing chances. But somewhat discouraged by the rapid turn of events, he indulges in a unique form of self-immolation. In short, Lombardy, not Maroczy, lost.
1 e4 c5
2 f3 d6
3 d4 cxd4
4 xd4 f6
5 f3 ...
A passive, non-developing move which leads to nothing. White wants to gain control of d5, establishing a Maroczy bind with c4, c3 etc. But after going to all that trouble he can't prevent ...d5 after all. Correct is that tired old move - 5 c3. 5 ... c6 Sharper is 5...e5! 6 b5+ (6 b5 a6 7 5c3 e6 8 d5 xd5 9 exd5 f5=) 6 .... bd7 7 f5 d5! 8 exd5 a6 9 xd7+ xd7 10 e3 c5 11 c4 b5=.

Better is 11 exd5 b4 (11... e5 doesn't work well now because of 12 d4 followed by O-O-O) 12 c4 f5 13 xb4 xb4 14 O-O c8. Black regains the Pawn, but with an inferior position. 11 ... xd5 12 xd5 ...

Again too optimistic. After 14 e2 f6 15 O-O-O White can survive - temporarily anyway (if 15... b4 16 xd7!). 14 ... b4! This unexpected "discovery" jolts White back to reality. 15 xb4 ... Loses the exchange, but avoids the worst. On 15 e2 xa2 regains the Pawn with continuing pressure. And on 15 c4 a5 16 xb4 xb4+ 17 f2 ac8 18 d5 xc1 19 xc1 e1+! White meets a devastating attack wherever he turns: i.e., 20 e3 (if 20 g1? b6+) 20... b6+

26 Fischer - Reshevsky [ U.S.A. ]
NEW YORK 1961: 2nd Match Game
SICILIAN DEFENSE
Time will tell The opening has always been regarded as the old warrior's weak point, and were it not for this handicap who knows how far Reshevsky might have gone toward the summit? Whatever the case, being familiar with the latest wrinkles does have the merit of saving time on the clock and, hopefully, of catching an opponent off guard. Although Reshevsky is bested in the theoretical duel (after 13 f3) his practical cunning enables him to extricate himself - at a great cost of time. In the end it is the clock, as much as Fischer's persistence, that causes his downfall.
1 e4 c5
2 f3 c6
3 d4 cxd4
4 xd4 g6 Allowing White the chance to get a Maroczy bind (with 5 c4). Apparently Reshevsky had booked up on this for the match. black's idea is to dispense with an early ...d6 and possibly strive for a later ...d5 (thereby saving a tempo).
5 c3 ...

7 e2 ...
In the 4th and 6th games of the match I continued with 7 c4 O-O 8 b3 g4 (8... a5? brought Reshevsky to grief against me in the US Championship 1958-9 after 9 e5 e8 10 xf7+! xf7 11 e6!! winning black's Queen) 9 xg4 xd4 and White got a clear advantage both with
10 h4 and 10 d1 respectively.
7 ... O-O
On 7...d5? 8 b5 wins a Pawn.
8 f4 ...
Despite his familiarity with the Dragon Variation, I felt Reshevsky really didn't know the latest wrinkles in Alekhine's Attack. The point of black's "accelerated fianchetto" becomes apparent after the indifferent 8 O-O? d5! 9 exd5 b4=. 8 ... d6 Now on 8...d5? 9 e5 e4 10 xe4 dxe4 11 xc6 bxc6 12 xd8 xd8
13 c4 gives White a winning ending. (Olafsson-Larsen, Wageningen

9 ... e6 I was right. This is the old (and second-rate) move. Correct is 9...a5!
10 a4 e6 11 d4? (after 11 g4 b4! black's Knight can no longer be
dislodged by a3; the best White has is 11 O-O c8=) 11... b6! 12 xe6 xe3 13 xf8 g4 with a strong attack. (Makievsky-Veresov, USSR
1954.)
10 g4 d5
11 f5 c8
Lipnitzky recommends 11...gxf5!? It's interesting. 12 exd5 b4 13 f3! ... The modern way - White maintains his center Pawn and sacs two Pawns on the K-side where black must expose his King to get them.
13 d6 has been known to be only a draw since the famous Alekhine-
botvinnik encounter, Nottingham 1936, which continued: 13... xd6! (if
13...exd6? 14 g5) 14 c5 f4 15 f1 xh2 16 xb4 xg4! 17 xg4
g3+ 18 f2 g1+ with a perpetual. Another weak line is 13 fxg6 hxg6 14 f3 xg4! 15 xg4 xg4 16 xg4 xc2+ 17 f2 xa1 18 xa1 c8! with a good game. If 19 d4? c4. (PANOV) 13 ... gxf5
14 a3 fxg4
15 g2! ... On 15 axb4 gxf3 16 xf3 g4 followed by ... h5-g6. White's whole idea is to keep black's Qb restricted to the Q-side. 15 ... a6 16 d3! ... Ney's improvement over 16 e2 f5! and the bishop retreats to g6, when necessary, defending the K-side. 16 ... e6 The best choice in a difficult position. Up to here we had both played briskly, but now Reshevsky began to consume time on the clock. After
16... d7 17 O-O-O e5 18 e2 black's game is lifeless. White has h3 and
d4 in the offing.
17 O-O-O ...
black gets the initiative after 17 d6? d5! 18 xd5 exd5 19 xd5 e8, etc. 17 ... xd5 The lesser evil. On 17...exd5 18 h3 g3 19 d4 is strong. 18 h3! g3 19 hg1 d6! Reshevsky is putting up a first-rate defense. 20 xd5 exd5 Despite his material deficit, it is obvious White has a strong attack. His problem is how to land a haymaker. 21 xd5? ... This gives black a little breathing space. Nowadays I would have played 21 d4! without giving it a second thought. After 21... xd4 22 xg3+ g7 (22... h8 23 xd4+ f6 24 f3 leads to a bind) 23 dg1 h6+ 24 b1 e6 25 xg7+ xg7 26 xg7+ xg7 27 g3+ h8 (if 27... f6 28 d6 g7 29 xd5 wins) 28 e5+ g8 29 g5+ h8 30 f6+ g8 31 e2 with a winning bind. 21 ... h8
22 f4 ...
22 d4 is less convincing now after 22... xd4 (if 22...f6? 23 xg3
xd5 24 xf6!) 23 xd4+ f6 and White has no forced win. 22 ... g6
23 d2 ...
Overlooking his reply. Vukovich suggests 23 f3 but 23... f5! 24 xg3 c6 holds. 23 ... xh3! Reshevsky chopped it off fast - he doesn't wait to be asked twice. 24 xg3 g4 black has succeeded in transferring the bishop to the K-side and in sealing the g-file.

27 Reshevsky [ U.S.A. ] - Fischer
LOS ANGELES 1961: 5th Match Game
SEMI-TARRASCH DEFENSE
Sheer pyrotechnics Here, in probably the most exciting game of the match, Fischer, trying to win a Pawn, unwittingly triggers a series of "desperado" combinations which are brilliant and unorthodox. Pure tactics predominate for a period of ten moves (19 to 29). It is almost impossible to determine who is winning until Reshevsky emerges a clear exchange ahead. In the tricky ending that ensues Fischer obviously is fighting for a draw. But, once again, he has the clock as an ally. In time-pressure, trying to preserve his slim advantage, Reshevsky plays an aggressive line in which Fischer finds a hole - enabling him to reverse their roles. Conscious of his newly acquired advantage, Fischer storms down the board with his K-side Pawns and overwhelms his opponent.

This game was played at the Beverly Hilton Hotel in Los Angeles, and I can still hear the audience gasping with each blow, thinking each of us had overlooked it in turn. "Fischer is winning!"

Now it's clear that Black's fighting for a draw.

The only way to preserve winning chances. After 33 xb6 d2+ 34 g1 g5 35 hxg5+ (on 35 cc6 gxh4 36 xe6+ g5 37 g6+ h5 38 xh6+ g4 Black has enough play on the K-side to hold the draw; but not 35 a5? gxh4 36 a6 h3 37 a7 h2+ 38 h1 g3 mate) 35...hxg5 36 cc6 (not 36 a5? g4 37 a6 g5 38 a7 f3+ 39 f1 g3 40 a8= g2 mate!) 36...g4 37 xe6+ g5 38 h6 f4 keeps the balance. 33 ... d3 34 xb6 ...

35 a5 f4
36 f2? ... Short of time, Reshevsky probably didn't see how Black's Rook could get back in time to stop the a-Pawn. But now it is doubtful that White can even draw! White should settle for 36 a6 f3+ 37 f1 (not 37 h2? e2+) 37... d3 38 e1 e3+ 39 f1 d3 with a draw. If 40 g1 d1+ 41 h2 f2 42 xf2+ xf2 43 b3 (43 a7 a1 wins) 43... d7 44 f3+ g7 45 xf2 a7=. 36 ... xf2 37 xf2 e5!
38 b4 e3!
This maneuver permits the Rook to get behind the passed Pawn.
39 a6 a3
Now White is stymied. In order to mobilize his Q-side Pawns, he must inch forward with b5, b7, a7, b6, etc. But a half-dozen moves, in chess, can be a lifetime.
40 c6 ...
The last move of the time-control, and it definitely loses. The best chance is 40 b5 with the possibility of b8 and b6 (giving up the a- Pawn) followed by b7, in some key variations. 40 ... g5 41 hxg5+ hxg5
42 b5 g4
The sealed move. Black's Pawns suddenly proliferate from nowhere!

The line I had expected was 43 c1 (intending to bolster the Pawns from behind with b1) 43...g3+ 44 g1 (on 44 g2 a2+ 45 f3 f5 wins) 44... a2! 45 b1 f3 46 b6 g2+ 47 f1 h2! 48 e1 h1+ 49 d2 xb1 50 a7 f2 51 a8= f1= and Black wins, since White has no perpetual check. 43 ... f5

28 Reshevsky [ U.S.A. ] - Fischer
LOS ANGELES 1961: 11th Match Game
KING'S INDIAN DEFENSE
A peccable draw What proved to be the last game of this ill-starred match is a good example of how Reshevsky, by virtue of pluck, stamina, and alertness, salvages a draw from a lost position. It exemplifies, too, the demoralizing effect that continuously strong resistance can have on even the most robust opponent. Fischer rapidly wrests the initiative and wins the exchange as the result of a pretty combination (28... xe4). However, he has difficulty gaining the offensive because Reshevsky throws obstacle after obstacle in his path. Nevertheless, Fischer's material advantage begins to make itself felt. He misses clear wins (on moves 38 and 42), whereupon his game deteriorates sufficiently to permit his stubborn opponent to set up an adequate defense. Still, there are several surprises in store just at the very end.

13 e4 b6
Hindering White's thematic break with c5. 14 g5? ... Apparently gaining a tempo, but only driving the Queen to a better square. 14 d2 or e1 appear to be more accurate. 14 ... e8
15 d2 ...
This Bishop must retreat eventually after ...h6. The idea is to prepare b4 without having to fear the reply ...a5. 15 ... a5 Gaining more time. White must now stop for b3 (to enforce b4). On the immediate 16 a3 a4! fixes the Q-side.
16 e1 xe2+
Otherwise the Bishop retreats to f1. 17 xe2 h6
18 b3 g5
19 a3 g6
Now it's obvious that it was a mistake to force Black's Queen to e8 - its presence on g6 lends momentum to the K-side initiative.
20 b4 f6
21 bxa5? ... Correct is 21 df2, but after ... h5 Black stands better. Now Reshevsky is hoping to get some counterplay after 21...bxa5 22 df2 h5 23 c5, etc. But - 21 ... g4! - doesn't give him time to get it in. 22 df2 ... Not 22 axb6? gxf3 23 xf3 xe4 24 xe4 f5 wins a piece. On 22 xf6+ xf6 23 f4 f5 White's in trouble. 22 ... gxf3 23 xf3 h5 Increasing the pressure. On 23... xd5 24 g3 holds.
24 e3 bxa5
Finally! 25 ac1 ... Typically, Reshevsky wants to mobilize his Q-side without making any concessions or creating any K-side weaknesses. After 25 g3 f4 26 h1 h3! it's just a matter of time before Black invades on the light squares. 25 ... f5
26 c5 ...
Loses material, but probably the best chance. On 26 g3 f7 followed by ... af8, White is not long for this world. 26 ... f4
27 g3 ...
Blunders the exchange. But no longer possible is 27 g3 xd5, etc. 27 ... xe4! 28 xe4? ... Flustered, White makes the task somewhat easier. Better is 28 xe4 (not 28 xf4? exf4) 28... xg3 29 hxg3 d3 30 cxd6 cxd6 31 c6 xe1 32 xe1 with many more chances of holding the ending than in the actual game. 28 ... xe4! 29 xe4 e2+

Correct is 53 h3! in order to keep Black's King out of g4 after the exchange of Rooks: e.g., 53... xe3 54 xe3 h5 55 f4 a1 56 c7 f5 57 f4 b1 58 c7! h1+ 59 g2 c1 60 f4! (gaining a vital tempo by hitting the Rook), 60... -any 61 h3! maintaining the blockade. 53 ... b7? Returning the favor. As Evans originally pointed out in Chess Life, "The best winning chance is 53... xe3+ 54 xe3 h5 followed by ... f5." Disgusted, I no longer thought there was a win. However, later I worked out a problem-like variation (after 54...h5): A] 55 g4? h4 wins. B] 55 e4 f6! 56 d4+ e6 57 f4 a4 58 e3 f5 leads to variations similar to "D". C] 55 f4 a5! 56 d2 f5+ 57 e4 f6 and Black's King will eventually penetrate to g4. For example, 58 f4 (58 e3? g5) 58... a5 followed by ... a4+ and ... f5.

29 Fischer - Geller [ U.S.S.R. ]
BLED 1961
RUY LOPEZ
Hoist with his own petard As was his wont, Geller gambles with 7... f6 in an attempt to assume an early offense. To thwart this maneuver, part of a patently prepared variation, Fischer sacrifices a Pawn (9 d4). Undaunted, Geller tries to continue his attack. But it backfires. With a series of rapier-like thrusts, Fischer demolishes Black in a mere twenty-two moves. Subsequent attempts to improve on Geller's play have likewise failed. Thus, this fruitful encounter offers what has come to be accepted as the refutation of Black's ultra-aggressive system.

At that time this was considered inferior because it allows the pin which Black can initiate with his next move. 5 xc6+ or 5 c3 were more standard. The text is more non-committal.

He still looked happy. 10 bd2 g6 No better is 10... xf3 11 xf3 e4 12 e1 d5 13 g5 d6 (on 13... e6 14 c4! is the bone-crusher; or 13... g6 14 b3! b5 15 xd5 bxa4 16 e5 e6 17 xe6+ fxe6 18 xc6 wins) 14 c4! dxc4 (if 14...f6 15 cxd5 xd5 16 b3) 15 d5! b5 16 dxc6 bxa4 17 xe4+ e7 18 xe7 xe7 19 e2 wins.

BLED 1961
KING'S INDIAN DEFENSE
A lyrical performance This draw has the charm of perfection. Each move is interesting and, to this day, appears flawless. With 17...c5 Fischer launches an intricate double-Pawn sacrifice which involves exact timing. Gligorich rises to the occasion, returning material in an attempt to wrest the advantage. The economy and ingenuity displayed by both players produces a harmonious flow of movement, remarkable in its esthetic appeal. The effect is of a pas de deux in which each partner contributes equally to the total symmetry.

31 Fischer - Petrosian [ U.S.S.R. ]
BLED 1961
CARO-KANN DEFENSE
The sincerest form of flattery This is Fischer's only win against Petrosian and it is achieved through an unconscious mimicry of the latter's style. Right up to the endgame Fischer seems content to return the ball without trying to force the issue. Each attempt to seize the initiative is meticulously rebuffed. Move by move, they seem to be drifting toward a draw. Petrosian offers one at move 27, but Fischer declines. Perhaps out of irritation, Petrosian immediately commits his first and only error. And Fischer, reverting to his normal style of play, takes full advantage of it.

So I refused - not because I thought White has anything in the position, but because I didn't want to give Tal the satisfaction! 27 ... d6? Serendipity.

32 Fischer - Tal [ U.S.S.R. ]
BLED 1961
SICILIAN DEFENSE
The moral victor After an early lapse by Tal on move 6, Fischer relentlessly presses home his advantage. He misses several opportunities to shorten Tal's resistance, but the outcome is never really in doubt. "Finally, he has not escaped me!" exulted Fischer. "It is difficult to play against Einstein's theory," sighed Tal, who went on to capture first prize. But it was Fischer, finishing a strong second, who had the consolation of scoring 31⁄2 out of 4 against the Russian contingent, and of being the only player (in a field of twenty) to emerge undefeated.

A perfectly legitimate treatment which Botvinnik labeled a "very cunning and well-masked idea." Actually no trap is intended. It becomes one only by virtue of Tal's reply. 6 ... f6? Probably the losing move! Tal looked worried immediately after having made it, but I'm not sure he was convinced he had really been careless. Correct is 6...a6 7 g2 f6 8 O-O, etc. 7 db5! ... Curiously enough, Bisguier, who was present at Bled and witnessed the game, forgot this move when he reached the identical position against Benko at San Antonio 1962! 7 ... b8 On 7... a5 8 d2 d8 9 f4 e5 10 g5 is strong.

Tal took a long time on this risky reply. The alternative 8...e5 9 g5 a6 10 xf6 (not 10 a3 b5 11 xf6 b4!) 10...axb5 (not 10...gxf6 11 a3 b5 12 d5) 11 g5 gives a clear advantage. 9 e2! ... Perhaps Tal underestimated this simple move. It prepares d4 and keeps an eye on the b5 square. On 9...a6 10 d4 d6 11 d1 axb5 12 xe5 wins at least a Pawn. Or
9...d6 10 d4 c6 11 xd6+ (Tal pointed out 11 xd6! xd6 12
xd6) 11... d7 12 b5 xd6 13 O-O-O, etc. In the tournament book Tal suggested the rather startling 9... g8 to avoid material loss. After 10 d4 f6 11 O-O-O (if 11 xe5 fxe5 12 c4 d8! holds) 11...a6 12 d6+ xd6 13 xd6 xd6 14 xd6 leads to a promising endgame. 9 ... c5 10 xe5! xe5

33 Fischer - Trifunovich [ Yugoslavia ]
BLED 1961
RUY LOPEZ
The drawing master Trifunovich has earned the reputation of being a very hard man to beat, and the other Grandmasters have acquired a healthy respect for his technical skill. At Bled, for example, he lost only this one game. Trifunovich's experiment with a dubious line in the opening meets with an abrupt and effective antidote (13 xd4), saddling him with an isolated e-Pawn for the duration of the mid-game. He decides, perhaps unwisely, to sacrifice it at an appropriate moment to gain some counterplay. Although he succeeds in outplaying Fischer in the endgame, he cannot overcome his material deficit. What ultimately defeats him is force majeure.

Considered to be weak - and it is. But Trifunovich must have had some equalizing idea in mind, since he rarely chooses a genuinely risky line. The tried and tested 7...d5 must be played.
8 e1 ...
A reader of Tal's Latvian chess magazine (Shakhmaty) suggested 8 xd4 but 8... e7! seems to hold: e.g., 9 e1 (if 9 xf7+ xf7 10 f3+ g8 11 xe4 d5 is adequate) 9...d5 10 c6! xc6 11 xd5 b7! 12 xe4 e7 13 xc6+ xc6 14 e2 f8, etc. 8 ... d5 9 c3! ... 9 xd4? xd4 10 xd4 e6 (threatening ...c5) is better for Black. 9 ... e6 On 9...dxc3 10 xd5 b7 11 xe4 (not 11 xe4+? e7!) 11... e7 (11... xd1? loses to 12 xc6++) 12 e2 prevents Black from castling. 10 xe4 dxe4 11 xe4 e7 12 xe6 fxe6 13 xd4! ... An improvement over the "book" line.

He thought quite a while on this. Weak is 13...e5? 14 h5+ g6 15 xc6, etc. On 13... d5 14 g4 O-O-O 15 e3 Black's e-Pawn is untenable. Finally the "simplifying combination" 13... xd4 14 xd4 xd4? 15 xd4 d8 falls short after 16 g4.

34 Bertok [ Yugoslavia ] - Fischer
STOCKHOLM 1962
QUEEN'S GAMBIT DECLINED
Hanging pawns unhung Classical theory expounds the danger of "hanging Pawns," but Fischer demonstrates here, in a revolutionary manner, that they are just as often an asset as a liability. Bertok's errors seem insignificant, yet he drifts into a passive position. On the verge of exploiting Black's loose center, he always lacks just the one tempo needed to do so. Meanwhile, using the open b-file as a base of operations, Fischer manages to force White into a defensive posture. In the midst of this Q-side tension, the winning move (21...g5) comes unexpectedly on the opposite wing.

35 Fischer - Julio Bolbochan [Argentina]
STOCKHOLM 1962
SICILIAN DEFENSE
A brilliant cadenza Called upon to face his favorite defense, Fischer quickly obtains the advantage against Black's rather passive opening strategy. Bolbochan, burdened with a bad Bishop against a good Knight, defends with extreme care but is gradually forced to retreat behind his lines. Disdaining several opportunities to enter a favorable ending, Fischer presses for a quick decision in the mid-game. His judgment is rewarded when the pressure which he painstakingly has accumulated erupts in a violent attack, beginning with 34 hxg6. Fischer's invasion on the weakened squares is a model of accuracy. It culminates in a keen combination which, appropriately, earned a tie for the first brilliancy prize.

Amateurs are often puzzled by this apparent loss of time. Actually it is a handy defensive move, getting out of the pin on the c-file which could become annoying after ...b5-b4.

Threatening f5. An example of some of the nonsense that has been written about my games, both by admirers and detractors, is the following (by Lublinsky) in the 1962 Russian Yearbook: "Brilliant intuition!

But I was hoping to win in the middle game. Ironically, I wouldn't have been awarded the brilliancy prize had I chosen the best line here. They don't give medals for endgame technique! 25 ... g6!

36 Fischer - Korchnoi [ U.S.S.R. ]
STOCKHOLM 1962
RUY LOPEZ
Gaston and Alphonse "I like to coax my opponents into attacking, to let them taste the joy of the initiative, so that they may get carried away, become careless, and sacrifice material," wrote Korchnoi, whose comments are interwoven in the notes. Fischer needs no coaxing. He improves on a well-known Capablanca line (with 15 d5). Still, the advantage he derives, if any, is microscopic. Korchnoi seems to labor under the delusion that he has the worst of it, though Fischer keeps asserting that White has nothing. Nevertheless, he overreaches himself, giving Korchnoi a chance to assume the initiative. But Black falters and then cracks under the pressure of the clock.

Gligorich's 10...d5 is probably best. On the old 10... xe4!? 11 d5 d7 12 xe4 d5 13 xh7+! xh7 14 dxe5, White, according to Robert Byrne, can keep his extra Pawn and weather the attack. 11 cxd4 a5

Interesting is 14 bd2 xd2 15 xd2 xf3 16 gxf3. (Geller-Panno, Amsterdam 1956.) 14 ... a5 Korchnoi is of a mind that the retreat 14... b6 completely equalizes. But White can keep a pull after 15 bd2 cxd4 (maybe better is 15... fd7 16 h3 h5 17 g4 g6 18 d5 f6 19 b1 h5! Pietzsch-Szabo, 1962)
16 h3 h5 17 g4! g6 18 xd4. (Pietzsch-Matanovich, Havana 1962.)
15 d5! ... "A strong continuation which improves on 15 b2 c6! 16 d5 b4 (Capablanca-Bogolyubow, London 1922) when Black gains the advantage of the pair of Bishops."

17 b1 c4
Korchnoi considers this overambitious, believing that it creates too many Pawn weaknesses. He thinks Black ought to play 17... e5 18 h3 xf3+ 19 xf3 xf3 20 xf3 b4; but after 21 f4 e8 (too passive is
21... b7 22 d3, etc.) 22 g3 e5 23 xe5 xe5 (if 23...dxe5 24 d3)
24 f4 e7 25 bd1 (threatening e5) maintains the pressure.
18 h3 ...
"White does not fall for 18 b4? c3! 19 bxa5 cxd2 20 xd2 e5 when the ensuing break-up of the Pawn protection of White's King more than compensates for his extra doubled Pawn." (KORCHNOI.) 18 ... xf3 "Giving White the two Bishops, but if 18... h5 19 b4! is now strong:
19...c3 20 bxa5 cxd2 21 xd2 e5 22 g4." (KORCHNOI.)
In this line simply 19... b7 followed by ...a5 yields good counterplay. On 18... h5 I intended 19 g4! (deadening Black's Bishop is worth this weakness). 19... g6 20 f1-g3, etc. 19 xf3 cxb3
19... e8 20 b4 b7 21 d4 is strong. And 19...c3? 20 a3! leaves the
c-Pawn artificially isolated: White can encircle it by e3-d4, e3, etc. Black's Knight on a5 is stranded; should it retreat to b7, then b4 smothers its future. 20 axb3 c7
21 e3 ...
"Up to here, White has played in excellent style, but this inaccurate move considerably improves the Black position. White ought to play 21 d2 or, still better, 21 e2! protecting the KB and preparing the powerful maneuver d4." (KORCHNOI.) The truth is, White just doesn't have that much. After 21 d2 or e2 Black can still reply with ... c3. 21 ... c3!

"Now Black has sufficient play on the black squares." (KORCHNOI.)

23 ... fe8 "Worried by his loose Pawn front and his scattered minor pieces, Black decides that he ought to get another piece into play rather than spend a move protecting his King's side. However, Fischer soon demonstrates that the White Knight obtains splendid prospects on the King's side, hence 23...g6 is much better." (KORCHNOI.)

37 Keres [ U.S.S.R. ] - Fischer
CURAÇLAO 1962
SICILIAN DEFENSE
Only a draw This contest brings to mind Emanuel Lasker's axiom: "When evenly matched opponents play 'correctly' the games seldom have any content and frequently end in draws." Here a little incorrect play provokes a series of brilliant moves leading to a most unusual draw. Employing a slow, closed system against the Sicilian, Keres is strategically outplayed. By adjournment, however, he manages to achieve equality. Fischer refuses a draw, and the struggle flares anew. Working with a Rook against two minor pieces, he makes steady inroads. Each serpentine twist in the endgame, including the double error on move 56, is a joy, a revelation, and a study in itself. Keres' saving resources smack of sheer wizardry.
1 e4 c5
2 e2 d6
3 g3 g6
Sharper is 3...d5! 4 g2 dxe4 5 xe4 (on Lombardy's 5 bc3 f6 equalizes - but not 5...f5 6 d3 exd3 7 cxd3 f6 8 O-O) and White's attack is worth more than a Pawn) 5... f6 6 g2 c6 7 O-O e6=.
4 g2 g7
5 O-O ...
Harmless. Correct is 5 c3 c6 6 d4 with a powerful center. If Black goes Pawn hunting now he gets shattered: 6...cxd4 7 cxd4 b6? 8 bc3 xd4? 9 d5 c5 10 xd4 xd4 11 e3! xe3 12 fxe3 a5+ 13 b4 d8 14 c1 b8 15 O-O d7 16 d4 f6 17 c7+ f7 18 e5! with a strong attack. (Samarian-Wesen, corres. 1958.) The sober 6...e5 7 dxc5 dxc5 8 xd8+ xd8 9 a3 allows White only a slightly better ending. 5 ... c6
6 c3 e5!
7 d3 ...
Now White has to regroup in order to get in d4. 7 ... ge7
8 a3 ...
A lemon, but already White must fight for equality. On 8 e3 O-O 9 d4 exd4 10 cxd4 (Pachman-Tal, Amsterdam 1964) 10...cxd4 (also good is
10...d5 11 bc3 g4!) 11 xd4 e5 Black captures the initiative.
8 ... O-O
Deciding to ignore the Q-side. Keres hoped for 8...a5 9 a4! and White has tricked Black into weakening his b5 square.
9 b4 ...
Probably played against Keres' better judgment, but I guess he wanted to justify his last move. One lemon leads to another. 9 ... b6
10 f4 exf4!
Abandoning the center to play against White's shaky Pawn structure. 11 gxf4 ... Not 11 xf4? (or 11 xf4 d5) 11...cxb4 12 axb4 xb4! 11 ... d5! Wrong is 11...cxb4 12 axb4 xb4? 13 f5! ec6 14 d4 a6 15 e5, etc.
12 e5 ...
Poker-faced, as always, Keres made this move as though it were the most natural one on the board. But it was the last thing he wanted to do, since it exposes the poverty of White's strategy. 12 ... g4 Not bad, but 12... f5 à la Nimzovich is even better. After 13 g3 ce7 maintains a solid blockade, and Black can break with ...f6 at his leisure.
13 h3 xe2
Even stronger is 13... e6 14 g3 d7 15 h2 f6. The absence of Black's QB makes it difficult to exploit the white square weaknesses. 14 xe2 f6
15 b5 ...
The only way to keep the center from crumbling. After 15 e6 f5 the advanced e-pawn becomes a target. 15 ... a5
16 d2 ...
Better is 16 a2. If then 16...fxe5 17 fxe5 xf1+ 18 xf1 xe5 19 g5! is strong. 16 ... fxe5 17 fxe5 xf1+ 18 xf1 ... Any recapture proves to be awkward. Also 18 xf1 c7! 19 f3 (not
19 d4 cxd4 20 cxd4 c3) 19... b3 is similar to the game.
18 ... b3
19 b1 xc1
20 xc1 c7!
21 e1 ...
Still impossible is 21 d4? cxd4 and White can't recapture because of the pin. Despite the drawing tendency of the opposite colored Bishops, White has a difficult game: he's weak on all the squares and his King is somewhat exposed. 21 ... d8
22 h2 ...
Black gets an iron grip after 22 d4 cxd4 23 cxd4 f5 followed by ... h6, etc. 22 ... d4 23 cxd4 cxd4 24 f3? ... A terrible boner, just when White could equalize with 24 g4! f8 25 f1. 24 ... h6! Keres probably underestimated the strength of this reply. 25 a2+ h8
26 e6 ...
26 ... d5? Tempting but wrong. Correct is 26... f5! 27 f6+ (if 27 h2? e3+ wins) 27... g7 28 e6 f8 followed by ... h6 again, and it's just a matter of time before Black invades on the weak dark squares. For example, 29 g5 (not 29 h2 c3!) 29... h6 30 e4 e3+ 31 h1 f4 32 f6 c3 33 d1 c2, etc. 27 h2! ... The saving clause. Not 27 xd4? c5. 27 ... e3 After 27... f4? 28 f6+ g8 29 g4 White wins! 28 c6! ... Now the Queen is hemmed in and Black has nothing. The Knight on e3 must coordinate with the heavy artillery to be really meaningful. 28 ... f8
29 f3 f4
On 29... d8 30 d6 holds. The chances are now even. 30 xd4 xe5
31 f3 d4!
32 xe3 ... Not 32 xd4?? g3+. 32 ... xe3+ On 32... f4 33 f2! holds. 33 xe3 g3+
34 f1 xh3+
35 e1 f5
36 d4 g7
36...h5? 37 h6+ g8 38 d5+ xd5 39 xg6+ draws.
37 f2! ... The right plan - the King must stay on the K-side to blockade Black's Pawns. Eventually Black, to make progress, must advance; but in so doing he will expose his King to perpetual check. Worse is 37 e5+ xe5+ 38 dxe5 f4 (intending a4). White's e- Pawn can always be stopped by the King. 37 ... h5
38 g3 g4+
39 h2 f4
On 39... f4+ 40 xf4 xf4 41 g3 holds. And not 39...h4? 40 e7+ f7 41 xf7+! 40 e7+ h6 The game was adjourned and Keres sealed his move. Upon resuming the next day, he offered me a draw, which I rejected. I knew Black no longer had a winning advantage, but felt no harm could come from continuing since there was little danger of losing. Besides, winning this game would still have put me in contention for first place even as late as round 14, the halfway mark.

I had a feeling this might be a mistake, but time was short and I had to make a move - any move. "Patzer sees a check, gives a check." But now the game can no longer be won. Correct is 56... xa3! 57 d5 g3 58 d6 (if 58 d7 a1 59 g2 a2+ 60 g1 f6 61 f5 f2) 58... a1 59 e7+ (if 59 g1 c5+ wins) 59... xe7 60 dxe7 h3! 61 e8= + f8 wins.

He makes no attempt to stop me from queening!? Gradually my excitement subsided.

38 Fischer - Keres [ U.S.S.R. ]
CURAÇAO 1962
RUY LOPEZ
Detective story Occasionally one comes across a miraculous victory in which, despite intensive post-mortems, there seems to be no losing move or pattern, no blunder on the part of the vanquished. But how can that be possible? A loser must make a mistake somewhere, however infinitesimal, however it may evade detection. Is it Keres' opening novelty which leads him to disaster? Could his defense have been improved afterward? If so: where? Whatever the answer, the reader is invited to share the magnifying glass with Fischer and hunt for that elusive error.

"Now it is not easy to find a satisfactory continuation for White."
(KERES.)
Keres' novelty, introduced on this occasion, has since become quite fashionable. I was - and still am - unimpressed. Black loses time redeveloping his knight to b6, but the K-side is weakened by its absence and it's questionable whether the Knight is not better where it stands originally. 12 dxc5! ... 12 bd2 was all the rage, but 12...cxd4 13 cxd4 c6 may equalize. But not 12 dxe5 xe5! with complete freedom. "In spite of having won this game, it is probable that Fischer is not very convinced of the correctness of this continuation, because in a later game he closed the center with 12 d5." (KERES.) According to that logic, Keres must not be convinced of the correctness of 11... d7 since he later varied with the old 11... c7 (against Gligorich at Hastings 1965). 12 ... dxc5 13 bd2 c7? This is supposed to lead to trouble. If such a natural developing move is bad, then what kind of a position is this for Black?

39 Botvinnik [ U.S.S.R. ] - Fischer
VARNA OLYMPIC 1962
GRUENFELD DEFENSE
The confrontation This dramatic meeting between the generations took place on board 1 after it was rumored that Botvinnik would be given a "rest day" against the American team. But it was fated that Fischer, at last, albeit with Black, would have a crack at the world champion. Walking into a prepared variation, Fischer promptly refutes it. "The reader can guess that my equanimity was wrecked," confesses Botvinnik, whose notes are incorporated here. Nervously, he proceeds to run his still tenable position downhill. But Fischer, instead of nursing his winning advantage, simplifies too quickly and reaches an adjournment where victory is problematical. After a sleepless night of analysis, Botvinnik finds a stunning defense. Fischer engages in a seemingly harmless transposition of moves (51...b5), and falls into a pit - throwing away the win he maintains was still there.

If White so desires, he can prevent the Gruenfeld by 2 c3 f6 3 e4. 2 ... f6

The sharpest try is 4 cxd5 xd5 5 e4. 4 ... g7

Botvinnik thinks 9... b6 first is more accurate.
10 d1 b6
10... xf3 followed by 11...e5 also gives Black active play.
11 c5 d6!

12 xd6 is answered by ...cxd6! improving Black's Pawn structure and neutralizing White's center. 12 ... xf3 13 gxf3 fd8 Wrong is 13... xc5 14 dxc5 xc3+ 15 bxc3 a4 16 d2! Botvinnik is of the opinion that 13...e6 (FURMAN) gives Black an equal game. But I feel it is not in the hypermodern spirit, which is precisely to tempt White into advancing his center Pawns in the hope they will become overextended.
14 d5 ...
Opening the diagonal for Black's KB can't be right, but White is still striving for an opening advantage. On 14 e5 xc5 15 dxc5 xd1+ 16 xd1 d7 17 f4 g5! 18 fxg5 xe5=. Or 14 xd6 (if 14 b5 xc5 15 dxc5 a4!) 14...cxd6=. 14 ... e5

"At once 15 f4 is not good because of 15... ec4 16 xc4 xc5 17 xc5 xc4 18 e5 xb2 19 d4 f6! and White's central position breaks up." (BOTVINNIK.) On 15 f4 also playable is simply 15... ed7 16 b5 (16 xd6 cxd6 gives Black a comfortable ending) 16...e5! 17 f5 (17 dxe6 e.p. xc3+! 18 bxc3 xe6) with equal chances. 15 ... f6! Weak is 15... xc5 16 xc5 c6 17 c7 (not 17 xa7? a4) 17... ab8 18 xe7 d7 19 d6 c8 20 e8! (not 20 f4 xe7 21 fxe5 xe5 22 dxe7 xe7) 20... xe7 21 xg7 xg7 22 f4!
16 f4 ed7
17 e5 ...
On 17 xc7? xb2 White can't castle and 18... b4+ is threatened. "When I was preparing to meet Smyslov, I, of course, made a thorough analysis of the Smyslov System in general and of the position on the diagram in particular! Here I reckoned that whether the Black Queen went to h4 or f5, it would be in danger; for example, 17... f5 18 b4 a5
19 d4 threatening 20 g4 or 17... h4 18 c2 g5 19 d4!
Alas, my opponent found a third continuation!" (BOTVINNIK.) 17 ... xf4! "A very unpleasant surprise - now White really had to start playing. Up to here I had only had to remember my analysis, though that was not so easy. I had a recollection of the Black Queen being trapped somewhere on the K-side; and following this track I managed to recall the whole variation. At last everything was in order - on the board was the familiar position; then suddenly it was obvious that in my analysis I had missed what Fischer had found with the greatest of ease at the board. The reader can guess that my equanimity was wrecked. However, if you assess 17... xf4 from an objective point of view, then although it is the best way out for Black, as you will see from what comes later, his position is still difficult." (BOTVINNIK.) When I made this move, I felt sure he had overlooked it. 18 xf4 ... Black's last is tactically justified after 18 xb6 e4! 19 f3 h4+! 20 f2 b4+ followed by ...axb6! (toward the center). 18 ... xc5 19 xc7 ac8
20 d6 exd6
21 exd6 ... Not 21 xd6? cd7. 21 ... xb2 "So Black has won a Pawn; but the Knight on c7 and the Pawn on d6 confine his Rooks - and also, White has two Bishops. The first thing White must do is complete his development." (BOTVINNIK.)
22 O-O bd7
"A bad mistake; evidently, Black overestimated his possibilities. Of course, he had to prepare the move ... e5; the only way this could be done was by 22... cd7 and after 23 f3 e5 24 xe5 xe5 25 xb7 b8 White has no more than a minimal advantage. Now White has the two important squares d5 and c5 at his disposal and his spatial advantage becomes crushing." (BOTVINNIK.) Needless to add, I couldn't disagree more. Why should Black return the Pawn?
23 d5 ...
Archives recommends 23 d5 but after 23... g7 the burden of proof rests with White - he's a Pawn down. 23 ... b6 24 f3? ... "Feeble play. Actually, White had played quite consistently so far and here he could have deployed his force with maximum efficiency by 24 c4! with the threat of e1-e7. The bishop is out of it on f3 and merely becomes an object of attack. Black now frees himself, and a Pawn down White is in a critical position." (BOTVINNIK.) After 24 c4! it is true that White has a bind, but with 24... e6 Black can practically force a draw, if he wants it, after 25 h2 d4 (threatening ... f6) 26 b1 c3 27 c1 b2, etc. 24 ... e6! "Apparently, this forces the exchange of the Knight on c7, for 25 h2 d4 26 g2 f6 is very bad for White. In fact, even here 26 xd4! (pointed out by Geller) 26... xd4 27 e1 gave White a real chance to get out of all his troubles. A second error running makes his position hopeless." (BOTVINNIK.) The reader is invited to judge for himself whether, in Geller's line, White has any real compensation for the exchange and a Pawn. Here
27... c5 followed by ... f6 or ... f8 should extricate Black.
25 xe6? ... This really took me aback. After 25 e3 at least White's still in the game. 25 ... fxe6
26 d3 ...
On 26 dd1? (or 26 d2? c1 27 d4 e5) 26... f8! 27 g4 xf4 28 xe6+ f7 wins. 26 ... c5
27 e3 ...
Bad is 27 d2 f8 28 d7 cd8. 27 ... e5 "The simplest. If 27... d4 28 a3 e5 29 g5 xd6 30 e7 d7 31 g4 Black lost the exchange." (BOTVINNIK.) 28 xe5 ... Just leads to a dead lost ending. I expected 28 xe5!? (hopeless though it is) to try and keep a little "dynamic imbalance." 28 ... xe5 29 xe5 xd6
30 e7 d7
31 xd7 ... On 31 fe1 cc7! flushes White off the 7th rank. 31 ... xd7
32 g4 ...
"A pointless move, since White cannot go into the lost Rook and Pawn ending; he should have played at once 32 e1 f8 33 e3 (or 33 d5) - Black would still have had technical difficulties." (BOTVINNIK.) 32 ... c7
33 e1 f7
34 g2 ...
"And now 34 e6+ was preferable, as the Bishop is poorly posted at g4." (BOTVINNIK.) 34 ... c5
35 e3 e7
36 f3+ ... "White's best practical chance consisted in an exchange of Rooks and a position with his King on d4 (or e3), his Bishop on c2 and his f-Pawn at f4. But all that is impossible - 36 f3 h5! and White loses his Bishop."
(BOTVINNIK.)
36 ... g7
37 c3 e4
38 d1 d4
"Before this I considered the game completely hopeless for me, but the text move gave me new heart; why had my opponent allowed my Bishop to get to a good post (and the only good one!) at c2? Surely, by 38... e1! (39 c2 c1) White's defenses could have been completely disorganized." (BOTVINNIK.) After 38... e1 simply 39 f3 is more logical.
39 c2 f6
40 f3 g5
"In general terms, d6 is the best square for the King; for then the Knight would not need to defend the b-Pawn and Black would win by advancing his Q-side Pawns. But this maneuver is also not bad."
(BOTVINNIK.)
41 g3 ...
41 ... e4+ "Could have led to an immediate draw - and just at the very moment when Black was nearing his goal. You see, White was already in zugzwang: against a King move Black plays ... h4 and ... e6-f4(xh3); if b1, the reply ... d1 wins; and if the White Rook moves from its place, then ... c4 is decisive. So after, for instance, 41... b4 42 a3 d4 43 f3 a5 White would have had no satisfactory reply. It is psychologically understandable why Black decided on the Rook and Pawn ending - earlier (see White's 23rd move) White had avoided it. But there is a difference between these two endings - the Black King is in a bad position on g5." (BOTVINNIK.) Although I agree that Black can win by keeping the minor pieces and gradually improving his position, the text should also produce the same result, if only by a hair's breadth. 42 xe4 xe4
43 a3 ...
"Natural and bad. White is now in danger of defeat again. 43 c7!! was essential, and White gets a draw as in the game. The fact that his Pawn is on a2 and not a4 has no significance." (BOTVINNIK.) After 43 c7 a4 44 xh7 a3+! 45 f3 (if 45 g2 xa2 46 b7 a1
47 f3 f5 48 f7+ e5 49 g7 b5 gains a tempo over the game
because White's pawn is on h3 instead of h4) 45... xa2 46 h4+ leads to the same ending as the game, except White has already played f3 which Botvinnik, for some reason, carefully avoided. So the difference may be significant. 43 ... e7 "Perhaps 43...a5! 44 b3 b4 was better; Black obtained either a won Rook and Pawn ending or - after 45 xb4 axb4 46 f4+ f5 47 f3 e6
48 e4 (48 g4 h6) 48... d6 49 d4 b5 50 d3 d5 - a probably
won Pawn ending." (BOTVINNIK.)
44 f3 c7
"His last chance consisted in improving the position of his King by the maneuver ... h6-g7." (BOTVINNIK.)
45 a4 ...
"Here Black sealed a move. White's threat is to exchange a pair of Pawns on the Q-side by a5 (for example, 45... c4 46 a5 bxa5 [or 46...b5 47 f7] 47 f7 a6 48 h4+ h6 49 d7) after which the weakness of Black's h-Pawn together with the unfortunate position of his King would guarantee the draw. The most subtle move was 45... h6, although even then Black gets nowhere after 46 d3! c5 47 h4 a5 48 d4. What happened in the game is also most probably a draw."
(BOTVINNIK.)
The game was officially "drawn" at breakfast. The Russian team had a table near the American team. Someone inquired of Botvinnik what he thought of the adjourned position. Hardly looking up from his plate, the world champion shrugged, "Nichia" (draw). The word quickly spread, and I overheard someone at the English table saying: "The Russians said Fischer could have won before adjournment..." 45 ... c5
46 f7 a5
47 xh7! ... "A very fine idea, found during overnight analysis by Geller. Because of his bad King position Black finds it difficult to mobilize his connected passed Pawns." (BOTVINNIK.) This was the first defense I had considered! Passive play is hopeless: e.g., 47 f4 f5 48 c4 f7 followed by ... f5 and Black brings his King to the Q-side. 47 ... xa4 48 h4+! ... I had analyzed mainly 48 f4+ but Botvinnik's line is best and also contains a sly trap. 48 ... f5 "Or 48... f6 49 b7! a5 50 g4 b5 51 f4 a6 52 b6+ f7 53 b7+ and White is quite safe." (BOTVINNIK.) 49 f7+ e5
50 g7 ...
"The weakness of the g-Pawn and the a-Pawn gives White sufficient counterplay." (BOTVINNIK.) 50 ... a1
51 f3 ...
51 ... b5? Originally Botvinnik wrote in Chess Life: "This is a mistake in analysis. But even after 51... d5! 52 xg6 b5 53 e2 c4 54 h5 b4 55 g4+ b5 (if 55... c3 or 55... b3 then 56 h4 followed by h6-h7 is very strong) 56 d3 the White King reaches the Q-side and it is easy to credit the draw." Later in the 1962 Russian Yearbook, he analyzed the entire ending more exhaustively and came to the conclusion, after considerable soul- searching, that it was drawn even against the best line: 51... d4! The bracketed comments are mine. "52 xg6 b5 53 h5 b4 54 g2 b3 55 h6 b2 56 h7 h1! 57 xh1 b1= + 58 h2 b8+ 59 g1 h8 [59... e5! seems to do the trick: if 60 g8 e1+ 61 h2 xf2+ 62 h3 f3+! forces the win of the h-pawn or if 60 f1 h2 61 g7 a5 62 a7 d3!] 60 g4+ c3 61 h4 a5 62 g2 b3 63 h3+ c2 64 h4 a4 65 xa4 g7+! (if 65... xh7 66 g4-g3 and the Rook holds the third rank, shuttling to e3, if necessary, keeping Black's King out - with a draw); 66 f1 xh7 wins, since White can't get his Rook back to the third rank: e.g., 67 a2+ b3 [68 a5 seems to hold here] or 67 a3 h1+ 68 e2 d1+ 69 e3 c1+ wins the Rook. Or 67 g4 h1+ 68 g1 (if 68 e2 d1+ wins the Rook) 68... h3+ 69 g2 (if 69 e1 f3 forces mate) 69... d2 70 g1 e1 wins (71 g3 f1+). Was it really true that the adjourned position was lost? Was I mistaken?" (BOTVINNIK.) Botvinnik then went on to give a corrected analysis which, as we shall see, also falls short. 51... d4! 52 xg6 b5 53 h5 b4 54 h6! (instead of his previous 54 g2) 54...b3 (if 54... h1 55 g2! h5 56 a6 b3 57 xa7 xh6 58 b7 c4 59 f3 leads to a theoretical draw) 55 g4+ (if
55 h7 h1 56 g7 a5 wins) 55... c5! (not 55... c3? 56 h4 and White
queens with check; or 55... d3? 56 b4 c2 57 c4+ draws) 56 g5+ c6! [Here I break camp with Botvinnik, only to meet at the next diagram. He gives 56... b4 overlooking that White can obtain an immediate draw with 57 g7! b2 (57...a5? loses to 58 g2!) 58 h7 h1! 59 xa7 b3 60 b7+ c2 61 c7+ d2 62 b7, etc.] 57 g6+ b7! 58 g7+ (if 58 g4 a5 wins) 58... a6! (the idea is to keep the King off the b-file so that White's Rook can't check from behind) 59 g6+ (if 59 g2 b2 60 h7 b1= 61 h8= e4+! and White is bombarded with checks which lead to probable mate, certainly win of material) 59... a5! (not 59... b5? 60 g7 a5? 61 g2! wins) 60 g5+ (if 60 g7? b2 61 xa7+ b6 wins) 60... a4! (finally Black has crawled up along the a-file) 61 g4+ (61 g7 a5 62 b7 h1 is easy; or 61 h5 b2 62 h7 b1= 63 h8= d3+ 64 f4 e1! is the pause that refreshes - White is checkless - if 65 e5 d4+ 66 f5 xf2+ 67 e6 b6+ is decisive)
61... a3 62 h4 b2 63 h7 b1= 64 h8= .
Botvinnik also reached this position in his analysis independently, and concluded that it was a draw. However, it is precisely here, in this barren wilderness, that Black can wend his way to a win. Correct is 64... b3+! 65 e2 (if 65 f4 f7+ or 65 g2 d5+ 66 f3 d2+) 65... d1+ 66 e3 b1!! 67 f8+ (not 67 c3+? b3 or 67 h3 a2! 68 g8+ b3+ wins) 67... a2 and White's King will be without shelter from the coming avalanche of checks. Now to return to the dreary (for me) game. 52 h5! ... "Now Black is left with two RP's and the draw becomes a question of theory." (BOTVINNIK.)

40 Fischer - Najdorf [ Argentina ]
VARNA OLYMPIC 1962
SICILIAN DEFENSE
The Najdorf Variation The durable Najdorf Variation remains Fischer's favorite, and he constantly experiments when confronted with it. Here, against the originator of the defense, he employs an unorthodox continuation. Najdorf counters sharply, launching an early struggle. In order to preserve the initiative, Fischer gambits a Pawn with 7 d5. Najdorf unwisely declines, only to accept three moves later under more unfavorable circumstances. He loses his way in the complications, allowing a devastating sacrifice which pins his King in the center. Although Najdorf defends with precision, it is too late to compensate for his earlier dilatory tactics. He finds himself ensnarled in a mating net after twenty-four moves. Rather than prolong his agony, the grand old master tenders his resignation.

The idea is to exploit the hole on c6. Najdorf apparently underestimated the strength of this "eccentric" move which appears to violate principle by moving the same piece twice.

On 7...e6 8 xf6+ xf6 9 c4 b4 Black's Queen is misplaced and his Q-side has been weakened. Unclear are the complications stemming from 7... xe4! 8 f3 c5 and White is confronted with 2 main lines: A] 9 f6+? gxf6 10 xa8 b7 11 a7 c7 (or 11...e5 12 b4 exd4 13 bxc5 e7+ 14 e2 c6 15 b6 dxc5 16 O-O! is good for White) 12 b4 cd7 and Black has excellent play for the exchange. B] 9 b4! e6 (not 9... b7? 10 c3! but interesting is 9... cd7 10 c3! a7 11 g5!? or even 11 xb5) 10 bxc5 (if 10 f6+ xf6 11 xa8 xd4 12 xb8 xa1 13 xc8+ e7) 10...exd5 11 xd5 a7=. 8 xf6+ gxf6 9 c4! ... White must play sharply, else his advantage evaporates. After the tame 9 d3, d7 is tenable. 9 ... bxc4 Had Najdorf correctly evaluated the results of this decision, he would have chosen 9...b4. The 1962 Russian Yearbook gives 9... xe4 10 cxb5 g7 11 g4 g6 12 f5 with advantage. But 12...O-O is unclear. 10 xc4 xe4 On 10... a5+ 11 d2 e5 12 b3! xe4+ 13 d1 White has a very strong attack.

14...dxc4 15 f5 leads to the same type of position as the game,
except Black is without any material compensation. 15 f5! ... Perhaps Black had hoped for 15 b3 b6 16 xf7+ d8 with some chances for survival. 15 ... c5 16 g7+! e7 On 16... f8 17 h6 g8 18 b3 is murder. 17 f5+ e8 Back where we started - but Black has lost the right to castle.
18 e3 ...
Tal suggested 18 h6 but after 18... a7 19 d1 b6 Black is still alive. The text robs Black of any possible counterplay. 18 ... xe3 19 fxe3 ... The exchange of Bishops has failed to ease Black's defensive task. The threat of d6+ is now in the offing. 19 ... b6 20 d1! ... Again after 20 xf7+ d8! 21 d1 b5 White has no immediate forced win. 20 ... a7 21 d6! ... The crusher! Either 21 xf7+ d8 or 21 d6+ e7 allow resistance. 21 ... d8 Best under the circumstances. On 21... c7 22 xf6 wins. And on 21... xb2 22 xf7+ (finally!) 22... xf7 (if 22... d8 23 a5+ c8 [23... c7 24 e6 wins] 24 e7+ b8 25 c6+ a8 26 xa7) 23 xd7+ xd7 24 xd7+ g6 25 g7+ xf5 26 g4 mate.
22 b3 c7
On 22... f8 23 g7+ e7 24 a3! is very decisive. 23 xf7+ d8 On 23... f8 24 h5 and mates.

41 Fischer - Robatsch [ Austria ]
VARNA OLYMPIC 1962
CENTER COUNTER DEFENSE
A bright cameo Facing one of Robatsch's pet lines, Fischer proceeds to institute such a crisp attack that one is reminded of Morphy in his heyday. Noteworthy are White's 5th and 6th, practically refuting the whole variation. Seeking safety for his King, Robatsch makes the mistake of castling too early. Fischer, already castled on the opposite wing, incurs no risk advancing his K-side Pawns, using them as battering rams to pry open the g-file. Robatsch is unable to effect a closure and Fischer rushes into the breach - compelling resignation in only twenty moves.
1 e4 d5
2 exd5 xd5 This old move is considered weak but Black has a new twist in mind. The modern way is 2... f6. Then White has the choice of either 3 c4 or 3 b5+ to hold the Pawn, or simply 3 d4. Against Bergrasser at Monaco 1967, I chose 3 b5+ d7 4 c4 g4 5 f3 f5 (safer is 5... c8) 6 g4! c8 7 c3 bd7 8 g5 b6 9 b5+ fd7 10 f4 xd5 11 xd5 c6 12 c4 cxd5 13 xd5 and White's extra Pawn should prevail.
3 c3 d8
A hypermodern approach, championed by Bronstein. The idea is to give up the center and then play against it. Seidman, as Black, played the more traditional 3... a5 against me in the 1958-9 US Championship, which continued: 4 d4 f6 5 f3 c6 6 d5!? (possibly an improvement over the usual 6 b5) 6... b4 7 b5+ c6 (more crucial is 7... d7 8 xd7+ xd7 9 a3 f6 10 axb4 xa1 11 O-O a6 12 e1 with a terrific attack. Not 12...O-O-O? 13 e5) 8 dxc6 bxc6 9 a4 a6? (9... d7 is necessary) 10 a3! d8 11 d2 f5 12 axb4 d6 13 b3 e4 14 xa6 xd2 15 c1 xc3 16 bxc3 d6 17 O-O Black resigns.
4 d4 g6!?
The idea is to reserve the option of developing the KN to h6 followed by ... f5 with pressure on the d-Pawn. After the game Robatsch told me he'd enjoyed excellent results with this system. 5 f4! ... Against the pedestrian 5 f3 (or 5 c4 g7 6 f3 h6) 5... g7 6 h3 f6 (not 6... h6 7 g4! Sokolsky) White holds no more than a minimal edge. 5 ... g7 On 5... h6 6 e5! f6 7 f4 messes up Black's Pawns. 6 d2! ... Ignoring the "threat." Weak is 6 b5 a6 followed by ...c6, etc. (Bronstein-Kholmov, USSR 1959). And 6 f3 h6 would permit Black the setup he is striving for. 6 ... f6 Stymied, Black can no longer play ... h6. The main line is 6... xd4 7 xd4 xd4 8 b5 b6 (forced) 9 xc7+ xc7 10 xc7 with the two Bishops and all the chances. Another possibility is 6... xd4? 7 O-O-O c6 8 b5 d7 9 d5! (not 9 xc6? xc6 10 xd4? xd4 11 xd4 xg2) 9...e5 10 f3 and Black will never get out of the opening alive.
7 O-O-O c6
Better is 7... d5 8 e5 (8 h6!? xh6 9 xh6 xc3 ruptures White's Pawns) 8...O-O 9 h4 h5 10 ge2 with a clear advantage but no forced win.
8 h6 O-O?
Castling into it - with a vengeance. Black should strive to castle long with 8... xh6 9 xh6 f5.
9 h4 a5
10 h5! ... The attack plays itself. My experience with this line dates back to the Dragon-slaying days (see game 2). 10 ... gxh5 Horrible, but Black must keep the h-file closed one way or another. On
10... d8 11 hxg6 fxg6 12 xg7 xg7 13 h6+ g8 14 f3-g5 is
slaughter. Or 10... xh5 11 e2 f6 12 xg7 xg7 13 h6+ g8 14 g4! d8
15 g5 h5 16 xh5 gxh5 17 xh5 f5 (or 17... f5 18 g6! xg6 19
g5) 18 g6! wins. On 10... f5 11 f3 (threatening g4) 11... xh6 (11...gxh5? 12 g5 wins) 12 xh6 gxh5? 13 g5+ h8 14 d3 wins a piece.
11 d3 ...
It's important to exclude Black's Bishop from f5. 11 ... bd7 Not 11... f5? 12 g5. 12 ge2 ... Taking advantage of the lull to bring out the reserves. 12 ... d8 13 g4! f8 On 13... xg4 14 dg1! (threatening both f3 and/or xg4+) wins at least a piece. Black hopes to hang on by clustering minor pieces around his King. 14 gxh5 ... Now the open g-file becomes the new base of operations. 14 ... e6 15 dg1 h8 Also hopeless is 15... f8 16 xg7+ xg7 17 h6 g4 18 xh7. 16 xg7+ xg7
17 h6 g8
Or 17... e6 18 f4! forces mate.
18 g5 d8
Or 18... f5 19 xg8+ xg8 20 f8 followed by g1 is tasty. 19 hg1 ... 19 ... f5 Blundering a piece. But Black is completely tied up, and it's a pity he didn't allow the prettier finish after 19... f8 20 d5! d7 (if 20...cxd5 21 xd5 xd5 22 xh7 mate) 21 d6! f5 22 xf8 axf8 (or 22... gxf8 23 xf5 h6 24 dxe7 fb8 25 g7 xf5 26 xf7, etc.) 23 xf5 xg5 24 xg5 h6 25 dxe7 b8 26 g3! xf5 27 f3 winning a piece. 20 xf5 Black resigns
42 Unzicker [ W.Germany ] - Fischer
VARNA OLYMPIC 1962
SICILIAN DEFENSE
Playing by ear This game illustrates the hazard of trying to rely solely on natural talent, without detailed knowledge of the latest opening innovations. Seldom is a chess master so drastically punished, as is Unzicker here, for failing to do his homework. Disastrously pursuing a line with which Tal had just barely survived against Fischer, Unzicker blunders further through apparent unfamiliarity with Geller's improvement (15 h1!). That had previously defeated Fischer at Curaçao. Unzicker simply puts his trust in "natural moves" and drifts into a constrained position, allowing Fischer to penetrate neatly on the weakened squares. The early decision, on move 26, comes as a surprise only to Unzicker.
1 e4 c5
2 f3 d6
3 d4 cxd4
4 xd4 f6
5 c3 a6
6 e2 ...
On and off, White resorts to this solid and still respected system (championed by Smyslov) whenever the sharper tries fail. 6 ... e5 Black's expectation in this Najdorf Variation is that his control of important squares, with possibilities of Q-side expansion, will more than compensate for the slight weakness of his backward d-Pawn.
7 b3 e6
To provoke f4-f5, weakening White's e-Pawn. For the non-committal
7... e7 see game 4.

To hinder ...b5. 11 ... e7 Better than 11... c8? 12 a5 e7 13 xc4 xc4 14 a4! c7 15 e3 h6 16 f2 with a bind. (Schmid-Evans, Varna 1962.)
12 e3 O-O
13 a5 ...
A critical alternative is 13 g4 d5! 14 exd5 (if 14 g5 d4! or 14 xd5 xd5 15 exd5 f6 16 d6? xd6 17 xc4 xc4 18 xd6? xg4+ 19 h1 e4+) 14... b4 15 g5 xc3 16 gxf6 xb2 17 fxg7 fd8 18 b1 c3. White's Pawns are overextended and his King is exposed. 13 ... b5 Too passive is 13...h6 14 g4 h7 15 f2 followed by h4. 14 axb6 e.p. xb6 15 xb6? ... At Curaçao 1962, Geller had found the right line: 15 h1! fc8 16 xb6 xb6 17 xc4 xc4 18 e2 b4 19 a2! and Black is hard-pressed to defend his a-Pawn, but 19...h6! 20 fa1 f8 21 xa6 xa6 22 xa6 b7 23 a5 c7 24 b3 b7 (ZUCKERMAN) =. 15 ... xb6+
16 h1 b5!
Intending ... c6 followed by ...a5. 17 xb5 ... White has already dissipated his theoretical advantage. He should settle for 17 xb5 axb5 18 d3 with opposite colored Bishops. 17 ... axb5
18 d5 xd5
19 xd5 a4! Avoids conceding the a-file and puts pressure on the e-Pawn.
20 c3 a6
21 h3 ...
It's hard for White to hit upon a constructive plan. At Curaçao 1962, Tal played against me 21 ad1 c8 22 c1 b4 23 d3!? (White's in a bad way anyhow) 23...bxc3 24 bxc3 and now 24... xc3 (instead of my
24... a5 lemon) wins outright. If 25 xe5 dxe5 26 xe5 (26 d8+
f8!) 26... b4! 27 xc3 xf1+! (KMOCH). 21 ... c8 22 fe1 h6! A handy luft, as becomes apparent later.
23 h2 g5
24 g3? ... Creating more K-side weaknesses. Better is 24 ad1. 24 ... a7!
25 g2 a2
26 f1 ...
What else? On 26 xa2 xa2 27 e2 xc3! Now Black has a decisive shot. 26 ... xc3! White resigns 27 xa2 (27 bxc3? f2 mate) 27... f3+ 28 e2 f2+ 29 d3 xa2
30 a1 xb2 wins. Black's first rank is no longer vulnerable since the
King can escape to h7 on the check.
43 Fischer - Reshevsky [ U.S.A. ]
USA CHAMPIONSHIP 1962-3
SICILIAN DEFENSE
The missing link Many critics have dubbed this the "12th game" of the unfinished match, which had ended in a 51⁄2-51⁄2 tie. It is as adventurous and as bitterly contested as their earlier ones. This time Reshevsky is well prepared for Fischer's opening, countering forcefully and equalizing without difficulty. However, instead of maintaining tension, he strives inconsistently for simplifications, forcing an exchange of Queens which leaves him with a strategically weak ending. Working with simultaneous threats on both wings, Fischer, despite the reduction in material, succeeds in exploiting several of his opponent's targets (backward Pawns on open files). Reshevsky defends this passive position with his usual tenacity, but is unable to prevent an eventual breakthrough.
1 e4 c5
2 f3 d6
3 d4 cxd4
4 xd4 f6
5 c3 a6
6 h3 g6
A good reaction. So is 6...b5 (see game 40). By transposing into a Dragon Variation, Black hopes to render h3 useless, since in the normal Yugoslav Attack White will be forced to advance this Pawn again, thereby losing a tempo.
7 g4 g7
8 g5!? ... Consistent, but perhaps premature. However, no other method offers more: e.g., 8 e3 O-O 9 g5 e8! Or 8 g2 O-O 9 O-O c6=. 8 ... h5! On 8... fd7 9 e3 c6 10 d2 Black is slightly bottled up.
9 e2 e5
I had intended to answer 9... c6!? with 10 b3 (and not 10 xc6 bxc6 11 xh5 gxh5 12 xh5 b8 with good compensation for the Pawn).
10 b3 ...
Bad is 10 f5 gxf5 11 xh5 f4 shutting out White's QB. 10 ... f4
11 d5 ...
11 g4 c6 12 d5 might transpose to the game.
Objectively speaking, White has no opening advantage. 11 ... xd5 Instead of simplifying so readily, Black could try to exploit the weakened K-side. Tal says more "logical" is 11...O-O 12 h4 f5 (or the interesting Pawn sac 12... d7!? 13 xf4 exf4 14 xd6 e5). Another possibility is 11... xe2 (not 11... xh3? 12 e3 and the threat of 13 b6 wins material) 12 xe2 e6=. 12 xd5 c6 Tal gives the dubious sac 12... e6!? 13 xb7 d7 but 14 e3 keeps the upper hand. But there's no need for Black to gamble. His position is basically sound.
13 g4 xg4
Tal gives 13...f5 14 gxf6 e.p. (if 14 exf5 e7! 15 d3 gxf5 16 h5+ g6, etc.) 14... xf6 15 xc8 xc8 16 c3 c7, but after 17 e3 followed by O-O-O White stands better. 14 hxg4 c8! With the double threat of ... xg4 and/or ... b4.
15 d1 ...
On 15 xd6 xg4 16 d3 d8 17 e2 g2 18 f1 h6 Black wrests the initiative. 15 ... d4! Apparently intent on simplifying at all cost. Reshevsky steers for an inferior ending. Tal gives 15... e6 16 e3 O-O-O=. A Bulgarian magazine gives the sharp 15...d5!? as best, since it dissolves the backward d-Pawn immediately. The tactical justification shows up after 16 exd5 (if 16 e2 or 16 c3, ...d4) 16... b4 17 c3 (if 17 O-O xc2 18 b1 O-O foils White's strategy) 17... c4! and now there are two main lines: A] 18 cxb4? e4+ 19 d2 d8 20 c3 f8! 21 a3 (if 21 c5 xc5 22 bxc5 xd5 wins) 21... c8+ 22 d2 (not 22 c5? xc5 23 bxc5 xc5+ 24 b3 c4 mate) 22... e7! with a continuing attack. B] 18 h3 xd5 (if 18... e4+ 19 f1 c2? 20 d2 wins) 19 e2 c7=.
16 c3 xb3
17 axb3 e6 18 a5! f6? Leads to a lifeless ending. Better chances are offered by 18...O-O (or
18...b5 19 d5 xd5 20 exd5 d7) 19 d5 ad8 followed by ...f5.
19 d5! xd5 Not 19... xg4? 20 xb7 O-O 21 gxf6. 20 xd5 d7 21 gxf6 xf6
22 g5 e7
23 e2 ...
Now it's clear that Black's game is, at best, barely tenable. Both his d- Pawn and h-Pawn are ugly weaknesses exposed on open files. 23 ... af8
24 e3 c8
25 b4 ...
More accurate possibly is 25 c4 c7 26 b4 and Black has constantly to worry about breaks with c5, b5, or even f4. 25 ... b5!? Many annotators criticized this because it creates a fresh weakness (the a-Pawn). But if Black just waits he ultimately should get squeezed to death after d3 followed by c4, etc. Reshevsky apparently feels more comfortable living with his new weaknesses, rather than with the uncertainties which would be created after an eventual c4. 26 dd1 ... White cannot keep d5 under control indefinitely. In order to make progress, the Rooks must strike at the backward RPs. 26 ... e6
27 a1 c6
28 h3 ...
On 28 h4? h5! eliminates the weakness. 28 ... f8
28...d5!? loses a Pawn but offers a slight ray of hope: e.g., 29 exd5+
xd5 30 ah1 c4 31 xh7 xh7 32 xh7 e6 33 d2 (33 f3? e4+!
34 f4 b3) 33... b3 34 d3 xb2 35 e4! f8 (if 35... xc3 36 d5
d6+ 37 xe5 f8 38 c7+! b3 39 c8 e7 40 e8 d7 41 e6 wins a piece) 36 h8 g7 37 g8 e7 38 c8! followed by c6 should win. 29 ah1 c7 Now on 29...d5? 30 exd5+ xd5 31 xh7 xh7 32 xh7 c4 33 f7 c8 34 f6 b3 35 xa6 xb2 36 d2, etc. 30 h4! ... The critical position. Black is virtually in zugzwang. The Rook on h4 serves a valuable function, as will become apparent. 30 ... d5 On 30... c4 (if 30... f7 31 a1) 31 f3 c7 32 f2! d5 33 a1 c6 34 exd5+ xd5 35 d1+ e6 36 d8 should win. 31 a1! ... Reshevsky doubtlessly underestimated this interpolation. He probably expected 31 exd5+ xd5 32 d1+ e6 33 d8 g7! 31 ... c6 Or 31...dxe4 32 xa6+ d5 33 b6 wins. 32 exd5+ xd5 33 d1+ e6 The merit of the Rook on h4 is that it prevents the King from entering at c4.
34 d8 f5
With Black's Rook on c6 (instead of c7, as before) he no longer has the reply ... g7. And on 34... c7 35 a8 is decisive.
35 a8 e6
36 h3! ... 36 ... g7 Equally useless is 36... g4 37 g3+ h5 38 f3 g7 39 xh8 xh8
40 f8 g7 41 f7. Or 36... e4 37 f3 g7 38 xh8 xh8 39 f8 g7
40 f7 h8 41 f3+ d5 42 xh7 e8 43 d3.
37 xh8 xh8 38 xh7 e8 39 f7+ g4 Or 39... e4 40 f3+ d5 41 d3 wins. 40 f3+ g3 41 d3? ... A buzz began to circulate in the playing hall and I wondered what it was all about. Later they told me 41 f1! (threatening 42 f2+) forces at least the win of a piece. Of course the text move also wins, but it takes ten moves longer. 41 ... e4+ Throwing another Pawn to the winds in order to get the Bishop into play. On 41... c8 42 c5 also is easy. 42 fxe4 d8+

44 Fischer - Fine [ U.S.A. ]
NEW YORK 1963: Skittles Game
EVANS GAMBIT
Shock treatment Having become one of the leading players in the world, Fine quit chess at the height of his career (1945) to become a practising psychoanalyst; but he has lost none of his love for the game and little of his brilliance. The following is one of seven or eight offhand games played at his home in New York. As far as can be ascertained, Dr. Fine very nearly held his own. Here, departing for the first time from his beloved Ruy Lopez, Fischer employs the daring gambit introduced by Captain Evans a century ago. This ploy has all but disappeared from the arena. Fine, although the author of several opening manuals, is understandably rusty, and he gets caught in a vise from which he never escapes. Fischer uncorks a sparkling finish in seventeen moves.

45 Fischer - Bisguier [ U.S.A. ]
NEW YORK STATE CHAMPIONSHIP 1963
TWO KNIGHTS' DEFENSE
Ghosts Steinitz, nicknamed "the Austrian Morphy" (although two styles could hardly be more dissimilar), apparently exercises a great influence on Fischer, who has restored several of his pet lines to prominence. One of these is the bizarre 9 h3!?, found wanting at the turn of the century, and perhaps best left there. Bisguier appears unimpressed, regaining his gambit Pawn with a strong initiative. But he misses several opportunities to gain an advantage and is gradually outplayed. Just at the critical moment, when the chances are roughly equal, he commits the same kind of gross oversight that had doomed Fischer against Spassky (game 18). He suffers the same fate.
1 e4 ...
Best by test. 1 ... e5
2 f3 c6
3 c4 ...
The last time I played this move in a tournament was when I was 12, at the 1955 US Junior Championship. 3 ... f6!? Steinitz considered this to be an unsound sacrificial continuation!
4 g5 ...
Tarrasch branded this a "duffer's move" and Panov called it "primitive." But there is no other way for White to try for an advantage.
4 d3 is tame. And after 4 O-O xe4 5 c3 xc3 6 dxc3 e7! White has
no compensation for the Pawn. Finally, 4 d4 leads to the Max Lange attack. 4 ... d5 5 exd5 a5
5... d4!? (FRITZ) and 5...b5!? (ULVESTAD) are both interesting but
unsound. On 5... xd5 6 d4! (6 xf7!? is the "Fried Liver Attack") is so strong that 5... xd5 is practically extinct. 6 b5+ c6 7 dxc6 bxc6
8 e2 h6
9 h3!? ... To my knowledge, this is the first time that this move had been employed in Grandmaster chess for over seventy years. It is one of Steinitz's many unique opening contributions. The famous cable match game in 1891 between Steinitz and Tchigorin, which ended in a victory for Black, apparently caused the chess world to shy away from this variation. 9 ... c5 A] 9... d6 (STEINITZ) might be worth investigating. If 10 d4 (TCHIGORIN) then 10...e4 (FISCHER). B] 9... f5 is too crude: 10 O-O d7 11 e1 xh3 12 gxh3 xh3 13 f1 and Black is busted, e.g., 13... g4+? 14 xg4 xg4 15 h3 wins a piece (STEINITZ). C] 9...g5 10 d3 g4 11 g1 c5 12 c3 effectively wards off the threats (12... b6 is answered by 13 a4!).
10 O-O ...
Played by Steinitz in the 6th game of his second match with Tchigorin in 1892. Better is 10 d3! O-O 11 c3 e8 12 O-O xh3 13 gxh3 d7 14 g4 xg4 15 hxg4, etc., as I played vs. Radoicich here in a later round.
10 ... O-O
Dr. Gottschall, in the 1892 Deutsche Schachzeitung, suggests 10...g5, remarking it strange that a player as aggressive as Tchigorin did not chance it. Gottschall gives 11 h1 g4 12 g1 e4 13 xg4! xf2+ 14 xf2 xf2 and, although Black has won the exchange, prefers White's practical chances. After 10...g5 11 h1 g4 12 g1 e4 let us suppose White tries to avert material loss with 13 b4 (of no avail is 13 e1 d4 14 d1 xf2+ 15 xf2 xf2 16 xe5+? e6) 13... xf2+ (or Gottschall's 13... xf2 14 d3 h4 15 dxe4 g3 16 h3 [if 16 h3 gxh3 17 gxh3 g8] 16... xh2! 17 xh2 g3+ 18 g1 xh3, etc.) 14 xf2 xf2 15 bxa5 h4! 16 f1 g3 17 h3 g8 with a crushing attack.
11 d3 xh3
This certainly seems an improvement over the aforementioned Steinitz-Tchigorin match game which continued: 11... d5 (Gottschall's
11... h7 also merits attention) 12 c4 e7 13 h1 xh3 14 gxh3 f5 15
f4 exf4 16 xf4 e3 17 xe3 xe3 18 c3 and White won easily with his Q-side majority. 12 gxh3 d7
13 f3 ...
A difficult choice. I rejected 13 g2 since this was the square I had reserved for my Bishop. On 13 g4 xg4 followed by ...f5 gives fair attacking chances. 13 ... xh3 So Black regains the Pawn, but I have faith in my two Bishops.
14 d2 ...
It would be a mistake to play for the win of a Pawn by 14 g2 h4!
15 e1 fe8! 16 xa5 g4 17 h3 xf2+ 18 xf2 (if 18 h1 g3) 18...
xf2+ 19 h1 e4! 20 hxg4 (if 20 dxe4 xe4) 20...exd3 with a winning attack. 14 ... ad8 Not 14...e4? 15 xe4 xe4 16 xe4 d6 17 f4, etc.
15 g2 f5
The Queen is forced off the h-file. On 15... h4? 16 f3 h5 17 e1 wins a Pawn.
16 e1 ...
Perhaps better is 16 f3 with possibilities of a slightly favorable ending. 16 ... fe8
17 e4 b6
18 xf6+ ... I was worried about the maneuver ... d5-f4. But sharper is 18 b4 b7 19 b5. 18 ... xf6
19 h1 c5
Stronger is 19...g5 preventing White's break on f4 once and for all. Then by bringing his Knight to h4(!) Black could get a good game. 20 c3! ... Serves the double purpose of preventing ...c4 and of enforcing f4. For all the good it does, Black's Bishop on b6 might just as well be a Pawn for the rest of the game. 20 ... c6 Too late now is 20...g5? 21 f4!
21 f4 d4
22 c4 ...
To prepare c3, driving the Knight away from d4. I didn't like the looks of 22 fxe5 xe5 23 f4 e2, etc. 22 ... g6 Intending ... h5 followed by ... f5. (Not 22... e6 23 a4 d7? 24 xd7 xd7 25 c3 c2 26 c6!)
23 c3 ...
After the game a kibitzer suggested 23 e4 h5 24 f5 but this allows Black to turn the tables by 24... e2 25 g1 f3! 23 ... f5 On 23... e2 24 f5 f6 (24... h5? 25 f3!) 25 e3 f4 26 e4 is tremendous. 24 fxe5 ... After 24 e4 h5 just who has got the attack is not quite clear! 24 ... xe5
25 f4 ...
25 f4 turns out badly after 25... c7! 26 e4 h5!
25 ... e2 Black is playing for an advantage. 25... e3 26 xe3 xe3 is absolutely equal.
26 e4 ...
The critical position. 26 ... xb2? A pity that just when the game was getting interesting, Black has to make this terrible mistake. Correct is 26... e8! (threatening ... 8xe4). Bad would be 27 g1 h5 28 af1 e3! 29 b5 xe4 30 dxe4 xf1 31 e8+ (if 31 xf1 g4 wins) 31... h7 32 xg7+ xg7 33 e5+ xe5 34 xe5+ f6 35 e7+ g6 36 e8+ g5 escaping the perpetual and should win. After 26... e8! therefore, the best White has is 27 f3 (to prevent ... h5) 27... xb2 28 ae1 with even chances, owing to the Bishop pair. 27 e5! ... Bisguier slumped and his chest collapsed, as he saw that Black cannot avert the loss of a piece. 27 ... e8 28 xf5 xe5 29 xe5 Black resigns
46 Fischer - Benko [ U.S.A. ]
USA CHAMPIONSHIP 1963-4
PIRC-ROBATSCH DEFENSE
Romp Chess Life, January 1964, reported: "In the later stages of the tournament some of Fischer's opponents did almost as much to guarantee his 11-0 score as Bobby did. The building tension worked to Fischer's advantage...On Monday, December 30, Fischer won his last game of 1963 - defeating Pal Benko with a neat little combination, after Benko had shown some suicidal tendencies in the management of his defense." And so, in twenty-one moves, another Grandmaster is demolished. Benko misses a chance to simplify (on move 15) in order to reach an inferior but possibly tenable ending. This is fortunate for the reader, who otherwise would be cheated of White's scintillating 19th move. That alone is worth the price of admission!
1 e4 g6
2 d4 g7

5 f3 O-O
6 d3 ...
An improvement over 6 e2 which I played against Korchnoi at Curaçao 1962. That game continued: 6...c5 7 dxc5 a5 8 O-O xc5+ 9 h1 c6 10 d2 a5! 11 b3 b6 12 a4 b4 13 g4 xg4! with a big advantage. 6 ... g4? Preparing to sac the "minor exchange." Interesting is Valvo's 6... a6!?
7 e5 dxe5 8 fxe5 d5 9 xd5 xd5 about equal. (Bisguier-Benko, match
1964.)
The book gives 6... bd7 7 O-O (7 e5 is best) 7...e5 8 dxe5 dxe5 9 fxe5 xe5 10 xe5 d4+ 11 h1 xe5 12 f4 c5 with a tenable game. Fischer-Perez, Havana 1965 continued; 6... c6!? 7 e5 dxe5 8 fxe5 d5 (Spassky's 8... g4 or maybe even 8... h5 is better) 9 xd5 xd5 10 c3 g4 11 e2! with a pull.
7 h3 xf3
8 xf3 ... I overheard someone explaining this game to a beginner: "You take off the Knight here, another piece comes out to replace it, so Black hasn't really stopped White's development..." 8 ... c6
9 e3 e5
On 9... d7 10 e5 keeps Black cramped. 10 dxe5 dxe5
11 f5 ...
Already threatening to obtain a winning bind with g4-g5. 11 ... gxf5 Best. My original note said: "If immediately 11... d4 12 f2 gxf5 13 exf5 with a quick crush in sight." This verdict was later confirmed in Bednarsky-Kraidman, Tel Aviv 1964, which continued: 13...b5 14 O-O c5
15 e4 c4 16 xf6+ xf6 17 e4 ad8 18 c3 fe8 19 h1 h8 20
ae1 b4 21 cxd4 exd4 22 c1 d3 23 b3 h6 24 xh6 xh6 25 f3 xe1 26 xe1 c3 27 e7! and White won in ten more moves. 12 xf5 ... After 12 exf5 e4! Black gets good counterplay. 12 ... d4 Benko is willing to gamble a Pawn to drive White's Queen from its dominating post. 12... d7 is safer, however.
13 f2 ...
I was tempted to accept the dare with 13 xe5! g4 14 xg7+! xg7 15 hxg4 with threats all over the place. For example, if 15... e6 16 e5 h8 17 h6+ g8 18 e4 wins. But 15... c6 is hard to crack. 13 ... e8 More active than 13... d7 14 O-O-O c5 15 b1 followed by e2 and c3 driving out the Knight. Now with ... d6 pending, Black threatens either to break with ...f5 or, in some lines, to advance with ...c5-c4.
14 O-O ...
An alternative is 14 O-O-O d6 15 e2. I thought White's King would be safer after the text - the drawback is the K-side Pawns can no longer safely advance. 14 ... d6 Sharp! I had expected 14...c6 15 e2 after which Black must either exchange his only well-placed piece or allow White's Knight to scramble to g3 followed by h5 or f5.
15 g3 ...
The only way to sustain the initiative. On 15 d5 f5 16 xd4 xe4! 17 xe4 fxe4 wins a Pawn. And after 15 e2 f5 gives Black active counterchances. 15 ... h8 On 15...f5 16 h6 f6 17 xg7 xg7 18 xg7+ xg7 19 exf5 6xf5 20 ae1 ae8 21 e4 with a comfortable edge, but certainly no forced win.
16 g4 ...
To prevent ...f5. 16 ... c6 Too passive. Black should seize the opportunity for 16...c5!
17 h5 ...
Threatening 18 xd4 exd4 19 e5. 17 ... e8? Either 17... e6 or ...c5 is essential. 18 xd4 exd4 19 f6! ... The zwischenzug Benko missed. He had expected 19 e5 f5! A bolt from the blue! 19 ... g8 Forced. On 19...dxc3 (or 19... xf6) 20 e5 mates.
20 e5 h6
21 e2! ... Black was hoping for 21 xd6 xe5! and he survives to an ending. 21 ... Black resigns There is no defense to the threat of 22 xd6. On 21... b5 22 f5 wins. Or 21... xf6 22 xh6 forces mate.
47 Fischer - Bisguier [ U.S.A. ]
USA CHAMPIONSHIP 1963-4
RUY LOPEZ
The Indian sign? Bisguier is the one Grandmaster who consistently obtains decent positions against Fischer, only to throw them away for no apparent reason. Out of something like a dozen encounters, he has squeezed but a single draw. Here is the only game in which Bisguier is outplayed from the start. Still, he does catch Fischer napping and nearly escapes. Describing his sensations before the game, Bisguier wrote: "For the first time I was really in doubt as to what Bobby would play against me as White...I was hoping to play the Black side of the King's Gambit or the Two Knights' Defense, but he 'surprised' me with the Ruy Lopez...taken by surprise I was not so prepared or comfortable as I would like to have been. Now that Bobby has added psychology to his arsenal of weapons he is a much more dangerous opponent than ever before."

xg5 (19... xd5 20 f3! e6 21 xe6 fxe6 22 g4!) 20 xg5 xd5 21 ad1 with a plus (LIPNITZKY). 16 g3! ... Bronstein's move - after first interpolating 16 a4 b8. This idea bankrupts Black's strategy. The slight weakening of the K- side is inconsequential, but Black's loss of time with his KN is. Actually the sharpest continuation is 16 a4! as I played against Eliskases at Mar del Plata 1960 (I simply forgot to interpolate it here)
16... b8 17 axb5 axb5 18 g3! g6 19 h4! e6 20 e3 c4 21 g5 xg5
22 hxg5 a5 23 g4 xg4 24 xg4 b3 25 xb3 cxb3 26 e3 with a great advantage. 16 ... g6 Simply 16... f6 may be best. Then on 17 h4 h6 18 e3 e6.
16... xh3 is bad owing to 17 g5 xg5 (if 17... xf1 18 xh5 xg5
19 xg5 f6 20 xf6! gxf6 21 xf1 White's better) 18 xg5 f6 (not
18... xf1? 19 xd8) 19 xf6 gxf6 20 e3 White has more than enough
for the Pawn. 17 h4! ... Bronstein's 17 h2 and Weinstein's 17 g2 are time-consuming and hence weaker. When I told Bronstein (at Mar del Plata 1960) that the text was a tremendous improvement over his game with Reshevsky, he replied: "Of course. After seven years one must find an improvement." 17 ... e6
18 e3 f6
Probably best. 18...c4 19 g5! is similar to the quoted game with Eliskases. 19 d5! ... Of course! Chess is a matter of timing. Given another move or two Black would be able not only to defend himself against this invasion, but even try for the initiative. 19 ... b7 Prudent. "Winning" the Pawn would allow White's Bishop-pair to enter the game with powerful effect: e.g., 19... xd5 20 exd5 xd5 21 c4! d4 22 xd4 xd4 23 cxb5 axb5 24 xb5 and now Eliskases recommends 24...c4 but I fail to see how this improves matters since 25 e3 b8 26 a4 b4? is answered by 27 e8+. 20 xe7+ xe7 White has the two Bishops - or a "half point" advantage.
21 h2 ...
This Knight is also bound for d5. 21 ... g7
22 g4 c4
23 f3! ... Winning the second "minor exchange." On 23... f8 24 e3 the Knight is ready to pounce on d5, especially after Black's Rook has been deflected from the d-file. 23 ... xg4 24 xg4 e6 25 h5? ... More accurate is 25 e3 (25... c5? 26 xc5 xc5 27 e6+ g7 28 ad1 penetrates decisively). 25 ... h8! Alert. I had expected 25...g5 whereupon 26 e3 is even more devastating than before. 26 g2! ... On 26 hxg6 g8 White is in trouble! 26 ... g5 Forced - eventually. On 26... g8 27 h1 gxh5? (27...g5 is better) 28 xh5 f4+ 29 xf4 exf4 30 e5! g7 31 exf6 xf6 32 xh7 wins.
27 e3 f4+!
28 h2! ... 28 gxf4? gxf4 threatening 29... g8 as well as 29...fxe3 regains the piece advantageously. 28 ... d3 29 xd3 cxd3? Now the advanced soldier must fall. Exchanging a pair of Rooks would make it more difficult, but White still maintains his grip after 29... xd3 30 ed1 ad8 31 xd3 cxd3 (31... xd3? 32 c8+ d8 33 xa6) 32 d1 d7 33 d2 threatening a winning bind with 34 c5. 30 ed1 d7 On 30...b4 31 d2 bxc3 32 bxc3 a3 33 ad1 xc3 34 e6 g7 35 h6+! wins.
31 d2 a5
A useless excursion, but there was no good defense. Strangely enough, Black's difficulty stems from his third move and its consequent weakening on b6. If the pawn were still on a7 (preventing a later b6) he might well hold. On 31... ad8 32 ad1 f7 33 b6 b8 34 c5 bd8 35 f3 picks up the d-pawn at leisure.
32 b3 d6
Not 32... c8? 33 xd3! 33 ad1 e8 On 33... ad8 34 xd3 xd3 35 xd3 xd3 36 b6! 34 xd3 xd3 Black is braced to give up his Queen for two Rooks and keep control of the crucial d-file. 35 xd7! Black resigns A devastating X-ray. After 35... xd7 36 xd7 it's just a matter of time. E.g., 35... e6 37 h3 followed by g4-f5, etc.
48 R. Byrne [ U.S.A. ] - Fischer
USA CHAMPIONSHIP 1963-4
GRUENFELD DEFENSE
The brilliancy prize K. F. Kirby, editor of the South African Chess Quarterly, summed up the astonishment and admiration of the chess world when he wrote: "The Byrne game was quite fabulous, and I cannot call to mind anything to parallel it. After White's eleventh move I should adjudicate his position as slightly superior, and at worst completely safe. To turn this into a mating position in eleven more moves is more witchcraft than chess! Quite honestly, I do not see the man who can stop Bobby at this time..." And one can add nothing to Byrne's own words: "And as I sat pondering why Fischer would choose such a line, because it was so obviously lost for Black, there suddenly came 18... xg2. This dazzling move came as the shocker...The culminating combination is of such depth that, even at the very moment at which I resigned, both grandmasters who were commenting on the play for the spectators in a separate room believed that I had a won game!"

It's hard for either side to introduce an imbalance into this essentially symmetrical variation. Deadeye equality also ensues after 10 f4 e6 11 b3 a6 12 e1 c8

10 ... a6
11 a3 e8
12 d2 ...
A good alternative is 12 c1. A kibitzer later suggested 12 f4?! to prevent...e5. But after 12...e6 followed by ... f8 and eventual doubling on the c-file, Black gets an advantage. 12 ... e5! I was a bit worried about weakening my d-pawn, but felt that the tremendous activity obtained by my minor pieces would permit White no time to exploit it. 12...e6 would probably lead to a draw. 13 dxe5 ... Passive is 13 ac1 exd4 (if 13... c8 14 fd1 e4 15 f3! is tenable) 14 exd4 c8 15 f3 although Black has difficulty breaking through. 13 ... xe5 14 fd1? ... Add another to those melancholy case histories entitled "the wrong Rook." Correct is 14 ad1! Originally I gave the following "refutation": "14... e4 15 xe4 dxe4 16 xe4 xd2 17 xd2 c4 18 xa8 xd2 19 d1 c4 20 bxc4 (best) 20... xa8 regaining the Pawn with a big endgame advantage." But Averbakh found a hole in my analysis with 20 c6! (instead of 20 bxc4 which I had carelessly given as "best"), 20... xa3 21 xe8 xe2 22 d7 and White is the one who wins instead of Black! I spent an evening just staring at the position after 14 ad1, trying everything, unwilling to let my brilliancy go down the drain. The more I looked, the more I liked White's game! For example, 14... c8 (14... d3 is refuted by 15 c2) 15 xd5 xd5 16 xd5 d3 17 g2 c2 18 xc2! kaput. No better is 14... d7 15 c2 followed by d2 and fd1 (if
15... ac8 16 b1!).
Another try which just falls short is 14 ad1 c7 15 c1! e4!? (otherwise 16 b1 consolidates) 16 xd5! xc1 17 xc1 xf1 18 xe4 h3 19 e7+ h8 20 xa8 xa8 21 f4 keeping the extra Pawn. Indeed, how does Black even equalize, let alone sustain the initiative? Finally I found 14... c8! - the only move to keep the pressure. Now on 15 xd5 xd5 16 xd5 d8 17 f4 xd5! 18 xd5 b7! 19 d8+ (if
19 d2 h3! 20 d4 g4 21 fe1 [or 21 c2 h5 with a strong attack]
21... xe3! should win) 19... xd8 20 xd8+ xd8 21 fxe5 xe5 with a
better ending. And on 15 c1 d7! 16 cd1 ad8 Black has finagled a precious tempo, since his Queen is on d7 instead of d8. After 14... c8! relatively best is 15 b2 (if 15 c1 e4 16 xd5 xe2 17 xe4 h8! wins the exchange. One possible line is 18 xc8 axc8 19 e7 c7 20 c1 d7 21 fe1 f3!) although Black keeps the initiative with 15... f5. 14 ... d3!
15 c2 ...
There is hardly any other defense to the threat of ... e4. A] 15 d4 e4 16 xe4 dxe4 17 b2 c8 with a powerful bind. B] 15 f4 e4 16 xe4 dxe4 (not 16... xa1? 17 d6) 17 ab1 c8 18 xd3 c3! 19 e2 xd3 20 g4 f5 21 h3 xb1! 22 xd8 exd8 23 f1 d1 24 g2 d3! 25 xd3 exd3 wins. C] 15 f3 h6 16 f4 (if 16 f4? d4!) 16... g7! resumes the threat of ... e4, only White has weakened himself in the interim. 15 ... xf2! The key to Black's previous play.

49 Fischer - Steinmeyer [ U.S.A. ]
USA CHAMPIONSHIP 1963-4
CARO-KANN DEFENSE
A complex trap While generally thought of as "one movers," some opening traps are deeper and more beautiful than others because falling into them requires a certain degree of skill. They might not attract and, if they did, might work for an amateur! Steinmeyer's concept beginning with 13... f4+ is both subtle and novel. The only trouble is that it meets with a smashing refutation. Instead of simplifying, as Steinmeyer hopes, his variation enmeshes him in complications. The nail in the coffin is 16 e5, after which Black's Queen can no longer be extricated without fatal loss of material.

On tour (1964) I experimented with the weird 5 c5!? Most of my opponents countered with 5...e5 6 xb7 xd4 (if 6... b6 7 c5 xc5 8 dxc5 xc5 9 c3 White's better. Fischer-Petrosian, five-minute game, Bled 1961) 7 xd4 exd4 8 d3 with the better ending. Some replied with 5... b6 6 a6 xa6 7 xa6 d5! Still others played 5... c7 6 d3 xd3 7 xd3 e6. White has more space, but only experience can tell whether he has the edge; however the Knight on d3 discourages the normal freeing maneuver ...c5 and/or ...e5. At least it's something to break the monotony. 5 ... g6

White can try to exploit the order of Black's moves by 8 e5, but 8... h7 9 c4 e6 10 e2 d5! (not 10... xd4? 11 xf7!) followed by ... d7 equalizes.

(if 13 O-O-O b4!) 13... d6 14 e4 (Tal suggested 14 d5!? mixing it up, but 14... xg3! holds; not 15 dxe6? e5; or 15 fxg3 cxd5 16 cxd5 xd5 17 xg7 g8 18 h7 7f6 19 xf6 xf6 20 xh6 xg3 21 d2=) 14... xe4 15 xe4 O-O=.

14 b1 c5?
He still has time to back out with 14... c7.

Now there is no turning back. On 15... cd7 16 e5! is very strong: e.g., 16... xe5 17 dxe5 d7 (or 17... g4 18 xd8+ xd8 19 d1+ c8 20 d4) 18 d4 xe5 19 xd7!, etc. 16 e5! ... A clear refutation. The Queen's retreat is cut off and the ancient weakness on Black's f7 is etched more sharply than ever. Shamkovich- Goldberg, USSR 1961, continued with 16 a5? which won only against inferior defense. 16 ... xf2 What else? 16... xg3 loses to 17 fxg3 xg3 18 d3 f4 19 f3 e4 20 xf7. And 16... xc3+ is refuted by 17 bxc3! g8 (if 17... g4 18 h5! f5 19 xf5 exf5 20 xf7) 18 d3 h5 19 f3 h6 20 xf7, etc. 17 df1! Black resigns Probably what Steinmeyer overlooked when he went into this whole mess. On 17... xg3 18 xf2 e3 (otherwise f3) 19 e2 f4 20 xf7 wins at least the exchange. Motivated by my lopsided result (11-0!), Dr Kmoch congratulated Evans (the runner up) on "winning" the tournament ... and then he congratulated me on "winning the exhibition."
50 Fischer - Celle [ U.S.A. ]
CALIFORNIA 1964: Exhibition Tour
EVANS GAMBIT
Tour de force As one of ten simultaneous clock games played on tour, at Davis College, this is a perfect example of the precept that if White makes a slip in the opening he is punished by loss of the initiative, while if Black makes a slip (since he is skating on thin ice from the very start) it is likely to be fatal. 6...d6 is the offender. With 9 h5 Fischer assumes a commanding control of space, but faces a strong defense which compels him to offer a piece in order to maintain pressure. Continuing with restraint and circumspection, he builds up the attack with a series of quiet developing moves - reminiscent of Morphy's famous victory over the Duke of Brunswick at the Paris opera. When the time is ripe, Fischer throws everything at Black's King, including the proverbial kitchen sink. His show of brute force is handsomely rewarded.

Black must return the Pawn with 6... a5! 7 xe5 xc4 8 xc4 d5! 7 dxe5 xe5 On 7... a5? 8 xf7+! xf7 9 d5+ e6 10 xa5 wins a Pawn. 7... dxe5 8 b3 a5 9 xf7+ f8 10 a4 is strong. 8 xe5 dxe5 9 h5! ...

12 O-O g4
12... d7 followed by ... b6 might be better, but this certainly looked
good at the time.
13 g3 xa3
14 xa3 e7! Apparently Black has freed his game. If now 15 c2 e5 virtually forces an exchange of Queens. 15 b5 is rendered harmless by ... e5. How's White to sustain the initiative? 15 b5+! ... That's how. This forces Black to weaken himself on d6, although White must sacrifice a piece to exploit it. 15 ... c6 On 15... d7 16 xc7 (not 16 xg4 c6!). 16 c4! e6!

28... b8 29 b1+) 29 b5+, etc.
Black may not have seen the mate, but he suspected the worst! 17 ad1! ... Piling on the pressure. White mustn't amateurishly rush in with 17 c7 d7! forcing him to simplify by 18 d6+ e7 19 xc8+ axc8 20 xd7+ xd7, etc., and the advantage has evaporated. 17 ... cxb5 He might as well take it since after 17... d7 18 d6+ e7 19 c4 White wins a Pawn without any risk.
18 c7 d7
Forced. 19 d6+ e7 20 f5+! ... The attack needs fresh fuel. Material is not what counts now, but open lines. Black is forced to capture against his will. 20... e8 is out because of 21 g7+.

Originally I intended 23 e1+ e5 24 xe5+ f6 25 xd7 xe5 26 xb5+ with a won ending. But then I remembered Emanuel Lasker's maxim: "When you see a good move - wait - don't play it - you might find a better one." 23 ... xf6 Not 23... e8? 24 e1+ e6 25 xc8 mate. On 23... xf6 24 xd7. 24 e1+ ... Note the amusing piece configuration. All Black's pieces are stepping on each other's toes. 24 ... e4 The only legal move! 25 xe4+ f6 26 xd7 fd8

Here I forgot Lasker's maxim. 27 e7+ would have forced mate in four. 27 ... Black resigns
51 Fischer - Smyslov [ U.S.S.R. ]
HAVANA 1965
RUY LOPEZ
Squeeze play Fischer competed in this Capablanca Memorial Tournament by long-distance telephone, and his victory over the winner is reminiscent of the famous Lasker-Capablanca duel at St. Petersburg, 1914, where Black was also gradually constricted and strangled. Taken by surprise with an antiquated line (5 d3), Smyslov soon gets into trouble. He finds a way out, although it burdens him with doubled King Pawns. After the subsequent exchange of Queens he apparently underestimates White's winning chances and permits himself to drift into a cramped ending. Applying persistent pressure, Fischer makes gradual inroads; the defensive task eventually proves too great and Smyslov buckles under the strain.

Steinitz's favorite, long abandoned, and the first time I've employed it in a tournament game. 5 ... d6 A solid but passive reaction. An alternative is 5...b5 6 b3 e7 7 a4, etc. Anderssen-Morphy, match 1858(!) continued: 5... c5 6 c3 b5 7 c2 O-O 8 O-O d5 9 exd5 xd5 10 h3 h6 (Steinitz had a field day criticizing White's last two moves) 11 d4 exd4 with a satisfactory game for Black.

On 6...g6 7 bd2 (or Bronstein's 7 g5) 7... g7 8 f1 O-O 9 h4 opens fresh vistas. 7 bd2 O-O
8 f1 ...
One facet of White's strategy is to defer castling and possibly institute a K-side attack with h3, g4, etc. Furthermore, this Knight can be deployed to e3 or g3 immediately without having to waste a tempo (after having castled) with e1. 8 ... b5
9 b3 d5
Inconsistent, after having lost a tempo with ...d6. Right is 9... a5 10 c2 c5 11 e3 e8 12 O-O f8 with equal chances.
10 e2 dxe4
Opens the position prematurely. No better would be 10...d4 11 g3 dxc3 12 bxc3 b4 13 d2. Black should keep tension in the center with
10... e6 11 g3 (if 11 g5 g4 12 f3 c8! 13 exd5 a5!) 11...h6.
11 dxe4 e6! I was surprised that Smyslov was prepared to saddle himself with doubled King Pawns, but surmised that it must be all right since he doesn't do such things lightly. Anyway Black's game, without this exchange, would remain permanently cramped. 12 xe6 fxe6
13 g3 ...
This Knight is undeniably misplaced here, but White intends to castle and then regroup his pieces in order to bring maximum pressure to bear on the doubled Pawns. 13 ... d7 Some annotators suggested the obvious 13... d6 (followed by e7-g6, etc.) but Black has no time for such sophisticated strategy: e.g., 14 O-O e7 15 c4! c6 16 d1 winning material (if 16... c7 17 g5).
14 O-O ...
During the game I was kicking myself for allowing the subsequent exchange of Queens. Sharper is 14 a4 ad8 (if 14...bxa4 15 c4 a3 16 b4) 15 axb5 axb5 16 a6 b4 17 O-O and Black can no longer ease his burden with ... d3. So correct is 14...b4! 14 ... ad8 Suddenly Black's plan hit me! At first I thought he just wanted to control the d-file; but now I realized he was scheming to chop wood.
15 a4 d3!
Of course! With the Queens gone, it's that much harder to strike at Black's weaknesses. 16 xd3 xd3 17 axb5 axb5 18 a6! ... Forcing Black's reply, and thus preventing the freeing maneuver with ... c5. 18 e3 would be met by ... g4. 18 ... d6 19 h1! ... The threat was 19... d4 forcing a favorable series of exchanges. 19 ... d7
19...b4 20 cxb4 xb4 21 a7 c6 22 xe5 c2 would give Black
active play for the Pawn.
20 e3 d8
20...b4 is still playable. Neither of us realized at this stage how
essential this move was. I didn't want to weaken my c3 and c4 squares by playing b4 to prevent it; and Smyslov didn't want to commit himself yet.
21 h3 ...
More accurate is 21 b4, from which I abstained for the reasons already mentioned. 21 ... h6 22 fa1 db8
23 a8 d1+
24 h2 ...
On 24 xd1 xd1+ 25 h2 d6 holds (26 a7? a1!). 24 ... xa1 25 xa1 ... 25 ... d7? When I spoke to Smyslov on the direct phone line immediately after the game, he congratulated me on a beautiful performance and attributed his loss to his reluctance to play ...b4 at some point - and this is his last chance. After 25...b4 26 cxb4 xb4 27 f1 Black obtains much more freedom than in the actual game, and eliminates a weakness (his b-pawn) as well. Perhaps Smyslov feared that in this line White could maneuver his Knight to c4; even so, this is hardly fatal. 26 b4! ... Smyslov confessed that he felt Black was probably lost after this riposte. But the win is far from easy, and Black might later have improved upon his defense. 26 ... f7

33 f1 ...
Preparing to bring the King to e2 where it can support the e1-d3 maneuver. 33 ... c8? A surprise! I had expected the much stouter defense with 33... e8! (intending to exchange Rooks with ... c7 and ... a8). After 34 a6 c8
35 b3 c5 36 bxc5 xc5! Black can hold. And there is no time for 34
e1 c7 35 d3 a8 36 b3 xa5 37 xa5 b8 38 a7 ca6 39 c4 c7. The main line is 33... e8 34 b3! c7 35 a7 a8 36 a5 b8 37 xa8 (if 37 b7 d7) 37... xa8 38 a7 d7 39 b7. It looks bad, but Black has chances to survive in the absence of a forced win. 34 e1! e8 Too late now.

52 Fischer - Rossolimo [ U.S.A. ]
U.S.A. CHAMPIONSHIP 1965-6
FRENCH DEFENSE
Peekaboo strategy The McCutcheon Variation gives rise to unusual positions where White is frequently obliged to forfeit the privilege of castling in order to try and wrest an advantage. After some slight but instructive opening inexactitudes on both sides, Rossolimo appears to achieve equality. Indeed, he is constantly on the brink of crashing through with a counter-attack against White's vulnerable King, although his own monarch is also stranded in the center. After 13...f5, which shores up his fortress, it's not clear just whose attack will come first. In a theoretically important formation - a logical offshoot of this variation - Fischer unearths two fine moves (17 b5+ and 19 g1) to sustain his flagging initiative. Still, he is forced to wage a running battle, no sooner landing a blow than having to duck. Consequently, the outcome is in doubt until the very last punch.

At least Black's King reaches safety in this line. 16 gxf5 exf5 17 b5+! ... 17 ... f8? On 17... c6 (if 17... d7 18 xd7+ xd7 19 e6!) 18 xc6+ bxc6 (18... xc6 is again met by 19 e6! xe6 20 e5 d6 21 xg6 xf4+ 22 xf4 and the Knight beats the Bishop in the ending) 19 hg1, etc. Black's best chance, however, is to try and reach sanctuary with 17... d8! 18 d3 e6. White undoubtedly has the initiative, but it's hard to get at the King.
18 d3 ...

Quite rightly. Rossolimo prefers active defense.

53 Portisch [ Hungary ] - Fischer
SANTA MONICA 1966
NIMZO INDIAN DEFENSE
Black magic Here is one of the few instances when Fischer does not employ the fianchetto of his King's Bishop as a defense to the QP. By ignoring White's gambit on move nine he lays the groundwork for the positional trap (11... d7) into which Portisch falls (14 xa8). Normally, two Rooks for the Queen is a good trade - better than good when it produces a setting in which the scope and power of the Rooks may be formidable. But Portisch's judgment is faulty, he fails to take into account the weakness of his Pawns. This is one of the rare occasions when the Queen can run rampant, and she does. Still, the question remains: how did Black manage to weave his spell? To achieve a winning endgame within fifteen moves, against a specialist with White in this opening, is an almost unheard of feat.

(instead of 9... xd3) 10 gxf3 c5 would lead to an exciting positional struggle - two Knights vs. two Bishops, but White's Pawn formation is shaky. 5 ... a6 Bronstein's active idea, trying to profit from White's last move. I had adopted it with success in the 1966 US Championship. A very interesting try is 5... e4!? as in the 1967 USSR Championship. Taimanov-Levin continued 6 c2 b7 7 f3 (7 a3 is better), and now instead of 7... xc3+ (as in the game) 7... xc3! 8 xc3 (8 bxc3 d6! 9 e4 c6 with good play against White's doubled c-pawn) 8... h4+ 9 f2 xc3+ 10 bxc3 xf2+ 11 xf2 a6! threatening... c6-a5 with at least equality.
6 g3 ...
Somewhat inconsistent. The whole point is to play 6 a3 so that after
6... xc3+ (if 6... e7 7 f4 d5 8 cxd5 xf1 9 xf1 exd5 10 g4! gives
White a slight edge, as demonstrated in the 1954 Botvinnik-Smyslov match) 7 xc3 White can avoid doubling his c-Pawn. After 7...d5 8 b3 O-O 9 a4 c6 I reached this position, as Black, twice in the 1966 US Championship. Addison played 10 b2? and got the worst of it after
10...dxc4 11 bxc4 a5 12 b5 c6 13 a3 e7! 14 c2 c5 15 e2
(finally) 15...cxd4 16 exd4 fc8 17 O-O c6! 18 f3 d5 and White's c- Pawn falls. Evans chose 10 e2 dxc4 11 a3! e8 12 b4 e7 13 O-O? (13 b5 b7 14 O-O permits White to regain his Pawn with a tiny pull)
13... ed5 14 c1 c6! 15 f3 b5 16 a5 c7 17 c2 ad8 18 fd1 b7
19 d2 xc3 20 xc3 c5! 21 dxc5 xf3 22 gxf3 xd2 23 xd2 d8 24
e1 d3 25 b2 d5 and White soon collapsed. 6 ... xc3+! Inferior is 6...O-O (not 6...d5?? 7 a4+) 7 e4 c6 (White keeps his initiative also after 7...c5 8 d5 d6 9 e2 exd5 10 exd5 xc3+ 11 bxc3 bd7 12 O-O e8 13 a4, etc. Portisch-Reshevsky, Santa Monica 1966) 8 d3! d5 (8... xd4? 9 a4 wins a piece) 9 cxd5 xd3 10 xd3 exd5 11 e5 e4 12 a3! with a clear advantage. Portisch-Spassky, Moscow 1967. 7 bxc3 d5
8 f3 ...
The whole idea is dubious. No better is 8 a3 dxc4! 9 f3 d5 10 e4 c6 and White hasn't got enough for the Pawn. Simply 8 cxd5 leads to level play. It is White's insistence on seeking the initiative that lands him in trouble.
8 ... O-O
9 e4!? ... Right is 9 cxd5 exd5 (not 9... xf1? 10 dxe6!) 10 xa6 xa6 11 e2 c8 12 O-O c5 13 dxc5 xc5 14 c4=. The text involves a gambit which Portisch probably had expected me to accept. 9 ... dxe4! An improvement over 9...dxc4!? which I had played against Saidy in the 1966 US Championship: 10 g5 h6 11 d2? (right is 11 h4! b7! 12 xf6 xf6 13 xf6 gxf6 14 xc4 or White might try to continue the attack with 12 h5!? bd7! - but not 12...hxg5? 13 hxg5 xe4 14 f6+!! wins - Spassky) 11... bd7 12 e5 d5 13 f5 (if 13 h5 h4!)
13...exf5 14 xd5 e8! 15 xc4 (or 15 O-O-O c5) 15... xe5! 16 xd8
xc4+ 17 xe8+ xe8+ 18 d1 xd2 19 xd2 e2+ with an easily won endgame. 10 xe4 xe4 11 xe4 d7!! The finest move in the game, far superior to the "natural" 11... d7 12 d3 f6 13 h4 with two Bishops and a beautiful development despite the doubled Pawns. Black can well afford to give up two Rooks for a Queen (after 12 xa8? c6), as will soon become apparent. The text prepares... c6-a5 hitting the "weakling," as Alekhine used to call that kind of a target.
12 a3 ...
White gets the worst of it after 12 d3 f5 13 e2 c6, etc. Still, this was a prudent choice. 12 ... e8
13 d3 ...
13 O-O-O seems more consistent, making a real fight of it. Such double-
edged lines, however, are not to Portisch's taste. 13 ... f5 14 xa8? ... Very bad judgment, White should resist temptation and try to hold on with 14 e2. His doubled c-Pawn, though weak, is not fatal. As the game goes, however, it is. 14 ... c6 15 xe8+ xe8
16 O-O a5
17 ae1 xc4 Too routine. Crushing is 17... a4! E.g., 18 b4 (if 18 c1 xc4 19 xc4 xc4 should easily win) 18... xc4 19 xc4 xc4 20 xe6 a5 21 e7 d2! 22 fe1 e4 23 f3 xa2! Curtains. 18 xc4 ... If 18 xf5? a4 wins. 18 ... xc4
19 c1 c5
20 dxc5 ... White cannot hold the ending. If 20 d5? simply...e5. 20 ... bxc5
21 f4 h6!
Preparing to expand on the K-side, which cannot be prevented.
22 e2 ...
If 22 h4 e5! 23 xe5 xe5 24 f4 f3+! 25 gxf3 a4 and White's Pawns are too loose. 22 ... g5
23 e5 d8
24 fe1 ... On 24 f4 d2! 25 fe1 e4 ties White up. 24 ... f7
25 h3 f4
26 h2 a6
Taking care of details, so that the Pawn will not be within the Bishop's reach after 26... d5 27 b8, etc.
27 e4 d5!
The Queen is boss. Black's superiority is obvious. He has some minor threats, and a major one which cannot be met. To the surprise of no one, Sovietski Sport, a Soviet magazine, reported that Portisch had blundered and thrown away a perfectly even endgame.
28 h4 ...
After the comparatively better 28 4e2, Black wins more slowly with
28... f3! 29 gxf3 (or 29 e4 fxg2 followed by... d2 wins) 29... d2, etc.
28 ... e3! Wins the exchange, as 29 f3 fails against 29... d2 30 g1 f2. 29 1xe3 fxe3 30 xe3 xa2 31 f3+ e8
32 g7 c4
33 hxg5 hxg5 34 f8+ ... A check before dying. 34 ... d7
35 a8 c6
White resigns The ominous presence of Black's a-pawn is the deciding factor.
54 Fischer - Najdorf [ Argentina ]
SANTA MONICA 1966
SICILIAN DEFENSE
Najdorf's night off from the Najdorf This game follows a loss (with Black) to Najdorf earlier in the tournament. Here, Najdorf adopts the Sicilian but not his Variation - perhaps because he had lost with it previously. (See game 40.) White soon launches a sharp line, a curious violation of principle involving three consecutive Bishop sorties before his other men have been developed. In relatively uncharted terrain, both players miss their way on move twelve. It then becomes a question of whether Najdorf's doubled center Pawns are a mass or a mess. Fischer proceeds to exploit his slight advantage with restraint, gradually building up pressure against Black's uncastled King. At the right moment he offers a stunning Pawn sacrifice (26 c5). Najdorf is compelled to decline, whereupon he lands in a hopeless endgame. This forceful and resourceful performance typified Fischer's surge throughout the last half of the 2nd Piatigorsky Cup.
1 e4 c5
2 f3 c6
Najdorf avoids the Najdorf Variation.
3 d4 cxd4
4 xd4 e6
4... f6 obliges 5 c3, which precludes the Maroczy Bind by c4. Ever
since ways of combatting the "Bind" have been found, it has become almost an obsession to abstain from 4... f6, although the most that can be said for other moves is that some of them may be as good.
5 b5 ...
Alekhine was of the opinion that 5 c4 is best, but it has since been discovered that White cannot maintain any advantage after 5... f6 6 c3 b4, etc. 5 ... d6 6 f4!? ... Sharpest. Objectively speaking, it is probably best to establish an immediate Maroczy Bind with 6 c4. 6 ... e5 After 6... e5!? 7 1a3! (Bronstein's idea) is best. But not Euwe's suggestion to win a Pawn by 7 d4 a6 8 xd6+?? xd6 9 xe5 because of 9... a5+! (ZUCKERMAN).
7 e3 f6
Black can avoid the doubling of his Pawns by 7...a6 8 5c3 f6 9 g5 e7. However, Najdorf may have been worried about 9 c4! Fischer- Badilles, Manila 1967, then continued: 9... e7 10 d5! xd5 11 xd5 O-O 12 c3 with absolute control of d5. After the text, 8 c4 is met simply by 8... e6! (but not 8... xe4?? 9 d5 e6 10 xe4 d5 11 xd5! and wins) 9 xe6 fxe6 10 c4! e7= (not 10... xe4? 11 g4). 8 g5!? ... Another of Bronstein's ideas. The customary line was 8 1c3 and after
8...a6 9 a3 Black has 3 possibilities:
A] 9...b5 10 d5 xd5 (or 10... b8 11 xf6+ xf6 12 b1! with an edge for White) 11 exd5 e7 12 c4 with advantage. B] Simagin gives 9... e6 10 d5 xd5! 11 exd5 e7 12 c4 f5 with harmonious development for all of Black's pieces. Or 10 c4 b5 11 b6 b8 12 bd5 xd5 13 exd5 e7 with a good game. But 13 xd5!? (instead of 13 exd5) launches a promising gambit (13... xe4 14 f3 c5 15 O-O-O). C] Best is 9... b8! 10 g5 b5= Aronin-Taimanov, USSR Championship 1962. 11 d5 is met by 11... a5+ forcing 12 d2 then
12... d8 and White has made no progress. On 13 xf6+ xf6 14 b1
b4! and White must regroup his forces. The third consecutive Bishop sortie is well-motivated since White is threatening to double Black's f-Pawn. 8 ... e6? Also weak is 8...a6 9 xf6 gxf6 10 5c3 f5? 11 h5! d4 12 c4 c7 13 d2 xc2+ 14 e2 xa1 (Bronstein-Polugayevsky, USSR Championship 1964) and now simply 15 xa1! must win out. Another try is 11... g7!? (instead of 11... d4) 12 c4 O-O 13 exf5 d4 14 d3 e8 15 e4! (not 15 f6? as in Estrin-Tcherepkov, Leningrad 1964). For instance, 15...d5 16 xd5 xf5 17 xf5 xd5 18 c3 xg2? 19 e4 xc2+ 20 e2 d4+ 21 e3, etc. But Black could equalize immediately with 8... a5+! 9 d2 (or 9 d2 d8 draws) 9... xe4 10 xa5 xa5 11 e3 (R.Byrne suggests 11 c7+? d7 12 xa8 xg5 13 b5+, but after 13... d8! 14 c3 d7 15 O-O-O e7 White's straying Knight is soon lost) 11... d7 12 xa7 d5, etc. 9 1c3 ... After 9 c4 h6! 10 xf6 gxf6 Black's position is excellent. 9 ... a6 10 xf6 gxf6
11 a3 d4
Other possibilities (all favoring White) are: A] 11...b5 12 d5! B] 11... e7 12 c4! C] 11...f5? 12 c4 xc4 13 xc4 fxe4 14 xe4 d5 15 xd5! 12 c4? ... Correct is 12 c4 and if 12... c8 13 e3 h6 (if 13... b6 simply 14 b1) 14 d3 g8 15 h5! snuffs out Black's initiative. 12 ... b5 Sharper is 12...d5! 13 xd5 (if 13 exd5 xa3 14 bxa3 a5) 13... xa3 14 bxa3 a5+ 15 f1 (or 15 c3 xd5 16 xd5 xc3+ 17 f1 c8! with advantage) 15...O-O-O with active play: e.g., 16 c3, then... b5, etc. 13 xe6 ... Of course not the tempting 13 d5? b4. 13 ... fxe6 All in all this exchange benefits Black since it enables him to protect his weak squares (d5 and f5). However if (as in the sequence) his central Pawn mass can be restrained, then it becomes merely a fixed target subject to constant pressure.
14 e2 c6
Black should get some scope for his pieces by 14... xe2! 15 xe2 d5. The check looming on h5 is not to be feared.
15 g3 ...
15 c4 at once is met by 15... a5+
15 ... d7? Dr. Kmoch recommends 15...d5! Or 15... a5+! 16 c3 b4 and if 17 c4 c5.
16 c4 d4
17 O-O b4
"Castling Q-side is a risk Black's insurance company would not permit him to take." (R.Byrne) The text later enables White to use this b-Pawn to pry open the a-file (after a3). Better is 17... g7.
18 c2 xc2

24 xa3 c6 25 e2! f5 Hoping to trade his h-Pawn for the e-Pawn in the event of 26 h5+. But White now is ready to exploit Black's poor development. 26 c5! ... More than a glancing blow. Black can know nothing about the imminent destruction of his compact mass of center Pawns. 26 ... xe4
26...dxc5 (if 26... xc5 27 h5+ followed by exf5, etc.) 27 h5+
e7 28 ad3 fxe4 29 3d2 is quite hopeless for Black. 27 xe4 fxe4 28 cxd6 ... Black's game is in ruins - note his pathetic triplets on the e-file. The rest is technique. 28 ... h6 To prevent e3-c4.

55 Fischer - Bednarsky [ Poland ]
HAVANA OLYMPIC 1966
SICILIAN DEFENSE
The price of incaution Once more Fischer rehabilitates his pet move (6 c4) against his favorite Najdorf Variation, and it is remarkable that he should continue to win with such ease. In fact, his opponents do not seem to offer serious resistance. Young Bednarsky apparently is caught napping, improvises, and loses in just 22 moves! Seeking active counterplay, Bednarsky blunders through bravado. He takes a tainted Pawn (9... fxe4) and impetuously pursues the attack only to find himself in an ambush which, ironically, he had helped to construct. By move 12 Fischer obtains a formation at which he had had success even as a child. Naturally he wins, but the economy with which he does so is delightful.
1 e4 c5
2 f3 d6
3 d4 cxd4
4 xd4 f6
5 c3 a6
6 c4 ...
Here we go again! 6 ... e6 Probably best. White's Bishop is made to "bite on granite."
7 b3 ...
Too slow is Bronstein's idea 7 a3. E.g., Robatsch-Fischer, Havana 1965: 7... e7 8 a2 O-O 9 O-O b5 10 f4 b7 11 f5 e5 (Black is healthy as long as White can't exploit his hole on d5) 12 de2 bd7 13 g3 c8
14 e3 (if 14 g5 xc3! 15 bxc3 xe4 with advantage - Gligorich) 14...
b6 15 xb6 xb6+ 16 h1 e3! (to prevent h5) with the better game for Black. White would of course like to get in f4-f5 as swiftly as possible, but he must exercise some caution. The text is essentially a waiting move which narrows Black's options. After 7 f4 Black has a choice of 7...d5, 7...b5, or 7... xe4 8 xe4 d5. 7 ... bd7 In order to reach c5 with an attack on the Bishop as well as the e- Pawn. But 7...b5! is better (see game 17). An example of static White play is Garcia-Fischer, Havana Olympic 1966: 8 a3 e7 9 e3 O-O 10 0-
0 b7 11 f3 bd7 12 d2 (12 xe6!? leads to rough equality) 12... e5
13 f2 c7 14 ac1 h8! 15 ce2 g8! 16 h1 g5! 17 h3 g6 18 g3
ag8 (White is curiously helpless against the threat of...h5 and...g4. His normal break with f4 is restrained by the silent Bishop on b7) 19 xe6? fxe6 20 xe6 xe4! 21 xe4 xe6 White resigns. After 7...b5 recent analysis indicates that Black's best plan is rapid development on the Q-side: 8 f4 b7 9 f5 e5 10 de2 bd7 11 g5 e7. Now on 12 g3? (Correct is 12 xf6 xf6 13 d3 c8 with even chances - Fischer-Zuckerman, US Championship 1966) 12... c8! 13 O-O h5! White's in trouble, as indicated by the following examples: A] 14 h4 b4 15 xf6 xf6 16 d5 xh4 17 xh5!? g5 18 f6 g6 19 g7+ d8 20 f3 g3 21 d3 h2+ 22 f1 c5 23 h3!? h4! 24 f3 xb3 25 axb3 xh3 26 xh3 xd5 27 exd5 xf6+ 28 e1 f4 and since there's nothing left - but emptiness - White resigns. (R.Byrne- Fischer, Tunisia Interzonal, 1967) B] 14 xf6 xf6 15 d5 h4 16 xf6+ gxf6 17 e2 xe4 18 d5 b6+ 19 h1 xd5 20 xd5 xc2 21 d3 c6 22 ac1 h3! (Ciocaltea- Gheorghiu, Bucharest 1967.) 8 f4! c5!? Too passive is 8... e7 9 f3 O-O 10 g4. Bad is 8...b5 9 f5! e5 10 c6! c7 11 b4! and White is ready to sit on Black once he occupies the hole on d5. 9 f5! ... Thematic. Bednarsky told me after the game he had reached this position before, as White, and he had continued 9 e5 dxe5 10 fxe5 fd7
11 f4 vs. Bogdanovich, East Germany 1964. Obviously that approach is
too tame. 9 ... fxe4!? Playing with fire. The question is whether 9...e5 is sufficient. Apparently not, after 10 de2 xb3 (not 10... cxe4? 11 xe4 xe4 12 d5 g5 13 h4) 11 axb3 h6 12 g3 followed by h5 with a bind. R.Byrne-Bogdanovich, Sarajevo 1967.
9... e7 is steadier than the text (for 9... xb3 10 axb3 see note to
White's 7th move in game 58). But White stays on top after 10 f3 O-O 11 e3. Now on 11...d5 12 exd5 xb3 13 xb3! exf5 (if 13... xd5? 14 O-O-O wins a Pawn) 14 O-O-O, etc. 10 fxe6! ... 10 ... h4+? Tempting, but suicidal. Black had two better tries: A] 10... xe6 11 xe4 xe4 12 xe6 fxe6 (not 12... h4+ 13 g3 xg3 14 g5! e4+ 15 d2 xh1 16 c7+ d7 17 xa8 wins) 13 g4 c5 14 e3! with a strong initiative. B] 10...fxe6! 11 xe4 xe4 12 O-O e7! (weaker is 12... c5 13 g4 - if 13... xb3 14 axb3 e5 15 f3). White has good play for the Pawn, but no forced win in view.
11 g3 xg3
12 f3! ... This twist is well known: e.g., from the Vienna 1 e4 e5 2 c3 f6 3 f4 d5 4 fxe5 xe4 5 d3 h4+ 6 g3 xg3 7 f3, etc. Only not 12 exf7+? d8 13 f3 e7+! 12 ... h5 13 exf7+ d8
14 g1 f5
15 d5! xf7 Black's attack has boomeranged. Now his King gets caught in a merciless crossfire. On 15...h6 16 f4! picks off the Queen. No better is 15... xb3 16 g5+ d7 (or 16... e7 17 xe7! xe7 18 xd6+) 17 e5+! 16 g5+ e8 17 e2+! ... By now I was hunting for bigger game than the paltry win of a Queen after 17 f6+ gxf6 18 xf7+. 17 ... e6
18 f4 d7
19 O-O-O ...
One threat of course is 20 e5+. 19 ... e8 Black is helpless. After 19... xb3+ 20 axb3 e8 21 ge1 g8 22 d3 it's also quits. The only way for Black to last is to give up his Queen with 19... xb3 20 e5+ c7 21 xf7 xf7. 20 xe6+ xe6 21 e4! ... Centralization with a vengeance! 21 ... g6 22 xe6 Black resigns On 22... xe6 23 xb7+ e8 24 ge1! wins everything.
56 Fischer - Gligorich [ Yugoslavia ]
HAVANA OLYMPIC 1966
RUY LOPEZ
The Fischer continuation Fischer's surprising 4 xc6, a revival of Emanuel Lasker's Exchange Variation - the one he used at St. Petersburg in 1914 to defeat Alekhine and Capablanca, but which subsequently fell into desuetude because ways to equalize were rapidly discovered - drew from his opponent the obligatory response. However, Fischer's next move, regarded as inferior, and his sixth (the customary follow-up) prepared no one for the gambit which he introduced on move seven. Gligorich reacted with innocent appropriateness until move seventeen, then made a startling blunder that met with speedy retribution. Because, in the course of the tournament, Fischer had played and won two other games with this very same line (demonstrating in each case White's hitherto unsuspected potential), it was promptly dubbed "The Fischer Variation." Of course, sticklers will insist that it should be called the Fischer continuation of the Barendregt Variation.

4 xc6! ... A surprise! I had introduced this in an earlier game against Portisch (see note to Black's 6th). After sizing up Gligorich over-the-board, I decided he was ripe for a repeat performance. 4 ... dxc6 This recapture is so automatic that most annotators fail to comment on it. After 4...bxc6 5 d4 exd4 6 xd4 White maintains an enduring initiative, If 6... f6 7 d3! (but not 7 e5 g6 8 O-O b7 9 e6? fxe6 10 e5 xg2+! 11 xg2 c5+ - an old trap.)
5 O-O! ...
"The text poses more problems for Black than does an immediate 5 d4 and Nimzovich is once more proved right in his pronouncement that the threat is stronger than its execution. Though White has sold his strong Bishop for a Knight, a Bishop which is usually Black's main strategical problem in many variations of the Lopez, there is no basic flaw in White's tactics. He has gained a tempo for development, somewhat spoiled Black's Pawn structure and revived the threat on Black's e- Pawn." (GLIGORICH). The text was favored by Emanuel Lasker, Bernstein and also, in recent years, by the Dutch master Barendregt. I had been pondering it for a long time before deciding to include it in my arsenal. 5 ... f6! "This position has not been seen frequently in the modern grandmaster praxis and, thanks to imaginative Fischer, we have to go back to the 19th century to find the alternatives for Black. It is not clear, however, that Black has any better way of defending the e-Pawn."
(GLIGORICH).
Black can defend his e-Pawn in numerous ways. Let's look at the lemons first. A] 5... e7? (played by Reshevsky) 6 xe5! d4 7 f3 xe4 8 e1 (instead of 8 d3? as in Malesich-Reshevsky, Maribor 1967) and it's doubtful Black can get out of the opening with equality. One example,
8... f5 9 b3! f6 10 a3 (or 10 e5!) 10... e6 11 d4, etc.
B] The ballet dancer Harmonist showed good sense by trying 5... f6 with the threat of... g4 (against Schallopp in Frankfurt 1887) but after
6 d4 exd4 7 g5! g6 8 xd4 White can get a clear initiative.
C] 5... d6? 6 d4 exd4 (not 6...f6? 7 dxe5 fxe5 8 xe5! - or 6... g4 7 dxe5 xf3 8 xf3 with a comfortable K-side Pawn majority, as in Schallopp-Blackburne, Frankfurt 1887) 7 xd4 f6 8 bd2! e7 9 c4, etc. D] A reasonable try is Bronstein's 5... d6!? 6 d3 (6 a3? works well against 6... e6? 7 g5 but 6...b5! strands the Knight) 6...f6 7 e3 c5 8 bd2 e6 9 e2 O-O-O=. White has possibilities of breaking on the Q- side after a3 followed by fb1 and b4, but Black can probably prevent this expansion. So best is 5... d6 6 d4 exd4 7 xd4, etc. E] The most ambitious continuation is 5... g4!? 6 h3 h5!? (Em. Lasker used to win such positions for White after 6... xf3 7 xf3. Hort- Kolarov, Poland 1967, continued: 7... f6 8 g3 d6 9 d3 g6 10 e3!? xg3 11 fxg3 and White managed to grind out a win in the ensuing endgame) 7 d3! (On 7 c3 d3! 8 hxg4 hxg4 9 xe5 d6! 10 xd3 h2+ draws. A fantasy variation occurs after 8 b3? xf3 9 xb7 d7 10 xa8 xg2! 11 xg2 h6! 12 g1 g6+ 13 h2 xg1 14 xg1 c5 with a winning attack) 7... f6 8 bd2! (Keres in his old book on the open games wrongly praises this whole line for Black, having considered only 8 hxg4? hxg4 9 g5 h6 10 h3 h4 11 h2 g6 12 c3 gxh3 13 g3 e7 with advantage) 8... e7 (now 8...g5 is met by 9 c4! xf3 10 xf3 xf3 11 gxf3 f6 12 h4! gxh4 13 f4 with promising play for the Pawn. But not 9 e1? e6 10 d4 g4 11 xe5 gxh3 12 g3 h2+ 13 g2 h4 with initiative) 9 e1! (or 9 c4! xf3 10 xf3 xf3 11 gxf3 g6 12 e3 c5 13 a4! White stands better and eventually won. Hort-Sliwa, Poland 1967) 9... g6 10 d4! d6 11 hxg4 hxg4 12 h2 xh2! 13 xg4! h4 14 f5 and White is slightly better.
6 d4 g4!
Best. In our earlier game Portisch had tried 6...exd4 7 xd4! c5 (Portisch played the more sensible 7... d6 in a subsequent event but it's still inferior after 8 h5+! g6 9 f3 xh2+? 10 xh2 xd4 11 d1!) 8 b3 xd1 (now 8... d6? is met by 9 xc5!) 9 xd1 d6 (the queer- looking 9...b6 as a defensive try scored an unmerited success in a Soviet women's tournament due to White's passive play. But 10 f4 a7! 11 c3 e7 12 a4! followed by a5 is almost decisive. (12...a5? is impossible because of 13 b5! Polugaievsky's 9... d7 offers defensive prospects) 10 a5! b5 (amusing is 10... g4? 11 f3 O-O-O?? 12 e5! and Black resigns. Hort-Zelandinow, Havana 1967. Keres tried 10... h6 but also failed to equalize after 11 xh6 gxh6 12 c4 e7 13 c3 e6 14 d5. Bagirov-Keres, Moscow 1967) 11 c4 e7 12 e3 f5 13 c3 f4 14 e5! xe5 15 xc5 and Black's disorganized position soon crumbled. 7 c3! ... The text involves a gambit. Curiously, this was Gligorich's own published suggestion when he annotated his game against Lee at Hastings 1965-6, which had continued 7 dxe5 xd1 8 xd1 xf3! (Fischer-Smyslov, Monaco 1967, went 8... fxe5? 9 d3! xf3 10 xf3 f6 11 c3 b4 12 g5! xc3 13 bxc3! [was Black playing for the cheap trap 13 xf6? xb2 14 xg7?? xa1 15 xh8 O-O-O!] 13... f8 14 xf6 xf6 15 xf6 gxf6 16 d1! and White should have won the ending) 9 gxf3 fxe5 10 f4 f6 and now 11 c3! (instead of 11 fxe5? xe4 12 e3 c5 13 d2 xd2 14 xc5 O-O-O as in the game) 11... d6 12 fxe5 xe5 13 a4! gives White the better of a probable draw. So the best is 7 dxe5! xd1 8 xd1 xf3! 9 gxf3 fxe5 10 e3! followed by d2-c4 with pressure. If 10... e7 11 f4! keeps the initiative. 7 ... exd4 An alternative is 7... d6 holding the center. 8 cxd4 d7 Black dares not accept the Pawn. 8... xf3 9 xf3 xd4 10 d1 c4 11 f4, etc. However, Gligorich said (in Chess Review) he had completely forgotten his Hastings analysis, which indicated Black's best as 8...c5! 9 d5 d6. 9 h3! ... "Putting the question to the Bishop." Nimzovich, Steinitz, Evans, and other theoreticians have pointed out the enormous value of kicking this Bishop before the pin becomes really troublesome. Here, White must exercise care since his h-Pawn could easily become a potential target. 9 ... e6 This natural retreat, which releases the tension, gives White too free a hand and is the subsequent cause of Gligorich's difficulties. Better is 9... h5! as played against me by Jimenez in a later round. After 10 e5! xd1 (bad is 10... xh3 11 gxh3 xd1 12 xd1 fxe5 13 dxe5 c5 14 g2 with a dangerous preponderance of center Pawns) 11 xd7 xd7 12 xd1 Black should hold the ending, although he found a way to lose: 12... e8 13 f3 (13 c3 is more accurate) 13... e7 14 c3 c8 15 e3 f5 16 ac1 fxe4 17 fxe4 g6? (17... g6 is correct) 18 f4! g7 19 d5! d8 20 a4! hf8 21 g3 g5? (cracking under the pressure - 21... f7 is more sensible) 22 xg5 f7 23 g2 cxd5 24 exd5 b8 25 e1 f8 26 f1! g7 27 f6 g8 28 ce1 d7 29 d6! cxd6 30 xe7 xe7 31 f7 resigns (if 31... e8 32 b6 c7 33 d5).
10 c3 O-O-O
11 f4! ... 11 ... e7? More solid is 11... d6! 12 xd6 xd6. The critical line is 11...g5!? 12 g3 h5 13 d5! cxd5 14 c1! and now: A] 14... d6 15 a4! b8 16 c5 e7 17 xa6+! bxa6 18 d4 d7 19 b3+ a7 20 xc7+!! xc7 21 xc7 b5 (if 21... c5 22 e3! is the simplest win) 22 c6+! (Palacio) 22... xc6 23 b6+ and mate next. B] The fantastic win is 14...dxe4 15 a4! b8 16 xc7!! xd1 17 c8+!!! a7 (or 17... xc8 18 b6 mate) 18 b8+ a8 19 b6 mate.
12 c1 g6
Black has lost time in order to reach this inferior square.
13 g3 d6
14 a4! xg3? Yielding his c5 permanently to the Knight. Correct is 14... b8 15 c5 e7. 15 fxg3 b8 Bad is 15...b6 16 d5! f7 (16...cxd5? 17 xb6+) 17 e2!, etc.
16 c5 d6
17 a4! ... 17 ... a7?? Catastrophic. After 17... c8 18 c3 (18... xg3? 19 e5 h4 20 xc6+), Black might have hung on with 18... f8! 18 xa6! ... The finishing stroke. 18 ... xh3 Desperation! 18...bxa6 19 xc6 costs Black's Queen to prevent mate. 19 e5! ... The most forceful method. 19 ... xe5 Sheer desperation!! After 19...fxe5 20 c5+ b8 21 c3! followed by a3 is most persuasive. 20 dxe5 fxe5 21 c5+ b8 22 gxh3 e4 Never say die! 23 xe4 e7
24 c3 b5
25 c2 ...
Time to consolidate. 25 a6 also does the trick. According to a Havana newspaper, some casual spectators who had just wandered in thought White had merely won two pieces for a Rook. Nobody could believe that Gligorich was playing on two pieces behind! The rude awakening came when - 25 ... Black resigns
57 Larsen [ Denmark ] - Fischer
MONACO 1967
KING'S INDIAN DEFENSE
Change of pace Larsen, uncharacteristically, forces an early exchange of Queens so that he can spring a surprise in the resulting endgame. Fischer beats him to it (13...b6) and proceeds to defend with meticulous care. It looks as if a draw must ensue, but Larsen presses. He is rebuffed, and again a draw seems imminent. Larsen senses no danger and, as if by inertia, continues to play for a win. As the game simplifies, the self-inflicted dark square weaknesses in the Dane's position gradually reveal themselves. By move thirty it becomes Fischer's turn to assume the initiative, and he probes these flaws judiciously. Thrown on the defensive, Larsen makes one or two reckless moves out of which Fischer constructs elegant combinations. Thus, what begins as a barren endgame is transformed into an exhibition of chess sensibility and virtuosity.
1 d4 f6
2 c4 g6
3 c3 g7
4 e4 d6
5 e2 ...
Larsen had won some good games with 5 f3 O-O 6 e3 but after 6... e5! (which no one seems to have played) White gets no advantage. 7 e2 c6 transposes into well-known modern lines. And 7 d5 g4 8 g5 f6 9 h4 e8 gives Black dynamic play. Now 10 h3 h6 11 g4!? f5 is too risky for White. Finally on 7 dxe5 dxe5 8 xd8 xd8 9 d5(?) a6! gives Black the better ending.
5 ... O-O
6 f3 e5
7 O-O c6
8 e3 ...
A bit of a surprise. I had expected 8 d5 e7 9 e1 d7 10 d3 f5 11 d2. Now I had in mind 11...c5! 12 f3 f4! (but not 12... f6? 13 g4! f4 14 h4! and Black's K-side counterplay is completely stymied) with active chances. Larsen-Najdorf, Santa Monica 1966, had continued 11... f6?
12 f3 f4 13 c5! g5 14 c1 g6 15 cxd6 cxd6 16 b5 f7 17 c2! e8
18 a4 and White came first on the Q-side since Black's attack never got
off the ground. 8 ... e8! The cleanest way to equalize. Najdorf found this move after some painful experiences with 8... g4 in his match vs. Reshevsky. The main point if that 9 d5 d4! levels. 9 dxe5 dxe5 10 xd8 xd8 A dubious improvement over 10... xd8! as played by Reshevsky in his match with Benko. After 11 g5 Black must not play 11... d7? (after which Benko's 12 d1!! followed by a4 was very strong) but 11... f8! solves all his problems.
11 b5 e6
12 g5 e7
13 fd1 ... Larsen is attempting to improve on Reshevsky-Fischer, Santa Monica 1966, which continued: 13 xe6 xe6 14 f3 c6 15 c3 d7 16 fd1 f8
17 f2 b6 18 b3 b7 19 a4 d7 20 b2 b5 with an eventual draw.
13 ... b6! In my 9th match game with Reshevsky, 1961, I tried 13...c6!? Larsen told me he had intended 14 xa7!? (instead of 14 xe6 xe6 15 c3 d7=) 14... d7 15 xe6 xe6 16 f3. But after 16... d7! (threatening... d4) Black has fair play for the Pawn, considering that the Knight is stranded on a7. The book text was an improvement that I had hatched some time ago. 14 c5!? ... Typically, Larsen adopts an enterprising continuation. He should settle for 14 xe6 xe6 15 f3 with a draw in view. By overestimating his chances, he gradually drifts into a losing position. 14 ... xc5 Naturally not 14...bxc5? 15 xe6 xe6 16 xc5 d7 17 f3 wins. 15 d8+ f8 No better is 15... e8 16 xe8+ xe8 17 xc5 bxc5 18 c4! Or 15... e8? 16 xc5 bxc5 17 xc7 xc7 18 xe8+ f8 19 xh7! 16 xa7 xa7 On 16... b7 17 xa8 xa8 18 f3 White has a slight pull despite his misplaced Knight. After 18...c6 19 c8 b7 20 d1 maintains some pressure. 17 xc8 ... White recovers his pawn with even chances. 17 ... g7 Black wisely resists the temptation of 17... cxe4?? 18 xe4 xe4 19 h6. But even more accurate than the text is 17...h6! 18 f3 g7 19 xc5 bxc5 20 d3 completely neutralizing any initiative for either side.
18 f3 e8
19 a3(?) ... Larsen's reluctance to simplify will soon backfire. Correct is 19 xc5! bxc5 20 b8 with theoretical winning chances because of the passed a- Pawn. But it would be difficult to make headway because of the opposite colored Bishops. 19 ... d6
20 d8 ...
Optimistic as ever! 20 b8 d7 21 d8 b7 22 c8 d6 would lead to a draw by repetition. 20 ... h6
21 h3 e6
22 b8 e8
23 xe8 xe8 "Now White's initiative is over and the position is even but by no means drawish. There is a lot of play." (KMOCH) White's dark squares, notably his d4, are weak. But it's still not too serious.
24 b5 ...
Pointless. White should start bringing his Knight into the game via f2. He can't prevent... c5, gaining control of the dark squares. Of course not 24 b4? xb4. 24 ... d6
25 f1 b7!
26 f2 c5!
27 xc5 bxc5
28 d1 h5!
To keep the Knight out of g4. This "prophylactic" thrust would have gladdened Nimzovich's heart. Not 28... d4? 29 g4 f6 30 f4!
29 d5 ...
Larsen still has illusions, but his game is fast deteriorating. More prudent is 29 d3 xd3 30 xd3 d4 31 f2. White probably should hold the ending despite Black's creeping pressure. 29 ... f6
30 h4 e7!
31 c4 ...
The Pawn is poisoned: 31 xe5? c6 followed by... d7 (or...f6). The mission of the Rook has failed, but no serious harm has been done. 31 ... c6
32 d2 d4!
Finally the Knight has gained this dominant outpost.
33 f1 ...
The more active 33 d3 is preferable. Now Black's tactical threats begin to proliferate. 33 ... f5!
34 b4 ...
Meets with a still sharper counter thrust. 34 d3 offered a better chance for survival. After the text White's a-Pawn is weakened. Not 34 exf5 xf5 with the double threat of... e3+ or xh4 (and if 35 e2? g3+). 34 ... b5!
35 g8 ...
35 bxc5 bxc4 clearly wins for Black. And 35 xb5? is refuted by 35... cb3. 35 ... fxe4! Fixing White with another weakness. 36 fxe4 ... Not 36 bxc5 e3 37 xd4 (if 37 d3 exf2 38 xf2 a8 39 a2 b4 - or 37 a2? exf2 38 xf2 f8!) 37...exd4 38 d3 xa3 39 e2 c3, etc. 36 ... d7
37 d3 a6!
Threatening c2 which, if played immediately, could have been met by 38 c3.
38 c3 c5!
This surprising combination apparently confused Larsen, who was in time-pressure. 39 g4? ... The last blunder. On 39 bxc5 b4! 40 c1! (not 40 axb4 a1+) there's still a lot of fight. If 40... xa3 (or 40...bxa3 41 a2) 41 c6 b6. 39 ... c4 This protected passed Pawn is just too strong. Not 39... f6 40 xc5! 40 gxh5 gxh5
41 d5 f6
42 g3 xd5
43 exd5 f6
44 g2 ...
The sealed move. White is completely tied up. On 44 g1? e2+ wins. Or if 44 e1 f4 mops up. 44 ... f5
45 h3 g6+
46 f3 d4+
47 e3 ...
On 47 e4 d6 White is in zugzwang. If 48 h2 (to prevent... g2)
48... g3.
47 ... g2

58 Fischer - Geller [ U.S.S.R. ]
SKOPJE 1967
SICILIAN DEFENSE
Flawed masterpiece After Fischer dropped this miniature (his third loss in a row to Geller) Kurajica concluded: "He just cannot play against Geller." Another Yugoslav, Trifunovich, opined at greater length: Geller is one of the best-prepared players in the world as to opening theory, and Fischer cannot be superior in that respect...Fischer [as White] chose a very sharp and modern variation...playing to win in the early stage of the game, as he usually does, and successfully, against weaker opponents. Fischer played better and attained a superior position, but it was very difficult to find the right solution over-the-board...There was his mistake...He has to impose a hard positional game, playing without pretensions for a win in the very opening. Nowhere but in the notes that follow have the above errors been answered. Were it not for a momentary lapse (a3?), Fischer would have won this little gem on move twenty - despite his critics.

There is no apparent refutation to Benko's roguish 6... b6!? Saidy ventured it against me in the 1967 US Championship. After 7 b3 e6 8 O-O e7 9 e3 c7 10 f4 O-O 11 d3 it's a mutually hard game. Also see game 11.

7 b3 cuts down Black's options. Fischer-Dely, Skopje 1967,

If 11...d4? 12 e2 e5 either 13 g3 or 13 d3 retains the advantage. Also on 11... e7 12 e5 d7 13 fxe6 fxe6 [or 13... xe5 14 f4!] 14 g4. Finally, 11... c5+ 12 h1 O-O may be tenable) 10 xd4 d5 (10... c5 11 xc5 dxc5 12 a4! puts Black in an excruciating bind) 11 e3! xe4 (if 11... g4 12 h1! xe3 13 xe3 dxe4 14 xe4! e7 15 ae1 and mate is lurking in the wings: e.g.,
15...g6 16 d5! d8 17 e5 O-O 18 e7+! wins. Slightly more
accurate, but still bad, is 11...dxe4 12 xe4 e7 13 d6+, etc.) 12 xe4 dxe4 13 f5! b4 (if 13...exf5 14 g4! e6 [14... b4 15 a4+! b5 16 d5! wins] 15 gxf5 xb3 16 axb3 b4 17 a4! xd4 18 xd4 and Black is in a curiously hopeless predicament: e.g., 18... e7 19 xe4 f8 20 f6!! xf6 21 xf6! gxf6 22 h6+ and mates) 14 fxe6 xe6 15 xe6! fxe6 16 xf8+! xf8 17 a4+! resigns. On 17...b5 18 xe4 d8 19 c6+! d7 20 d1 e7 and now 21 b6 (Dely). (About the only move that doesn't win is 21 g5? O-O!) 7 ... e7 Too routine. Black should start quicker action on the Q-side. More reasonable is 7...a6 8 b3 c7 9 e2 (or 9 f4) 9...b5 10 O-O-O a5 (10... b7 is also possible, whereupon White might reply 11 f3).

12...e5 (instead of 12... xg2) 13 h4 xg2 14 dg1 g4 15 xg2! xe2
16 xe2 exd4 17 xd4 with advantage (if 17... xe4 18 f3! followed by f5).
12 b1 ...
A critical position. White's immediate threat is 13 xf6. 12 ... c6 In a later round Sofrevsky tried to improve against me with 12... ad8, but got into trouble after 13 e3! Black now rejected a dangerous Pawn sac which must be examined very carefully: 13...b5!? But 14 a3! (not 14 xa7 a8 with active play) 14...b4 15 axb4 xb4 16 xa7 b7 17 b6! a8 18 f3 and Black has no good way to prosecute his attack. Consequently, Sofrevsky chose 13...b6 14 xf6! gxf6? (Black should reconcile himself to the loss of a Pawn after 14... xf6 15 xd6 c8) 15 d5!! fe8 (if 15...exd5 16 xd5 a6 17 h5! wins - 17... g4 18 g3, etc.) 16 xe7+ (16 h6! is a quicker kill) 16... xe7 17 xd6 c8 18 d4 e8? 19 xf6 resigns.
13 f4 ad8
If 13...e5 14 e3! xe4 (not 14... xe4? 15 xe4 xe4 16 d2 wins) 15 xe4 xe4 16 f3 with advantage. 14 hf1 ... I already had in mind the ensuing sacrifice. Also strong is 14 g4 - not to mention Trifunovich's post-mortem suggestion 14 f5! exf5 (not 14...e5
15 f2 d5? 16 exd5 xd5 17 xd5 xd5 18 xe5 wins a piece) 15 exf5
fe8 16 f2 with positional pressure. 14 ... b5 On 14...d5 15 e5 e4 16 f5! maintains the initiative. 15 f5!! ... The die is cast. I didn't want to lose a tempo playing it safe with 15 a3. 15 ... b4 16 fxe6! bxc3 17 exf7+ h8 Not 17... xf7 18 xf7+ xf7 19 c4+ d5 20 xc6, etc. 18 f5! b4 On 18... c7 I had intended 19 df1 (threatening xf6). If then 19... d7 (or on 19... xe4 20 g4 is bitter) 20 h5! (threatening xh7+) is decisive. 19 f1! ... A hard move to find - it took around 45 minutes. The threat of xf6 must be attended to. 19 ... xe4 A fighting defense. 19... d7 loses immediately to 20 h5 e5 21 f5 h6 22 g6!! xf7 (22... xg6 allows 23 xh6 mate) 23 xe5, etc. On
19... xf7 20 xc3 wins. And 19... xe4 gives White the pleasant choice
of 20 xf6 or 20 b5. Objectively best is 19... g4. But after 20 xc3 (20 h5 d7! holds)
20... b7 (if 20... xe4 21 d4!) 21 f4 with three Pawns for the piece
and a winning attack in the offing. 20 a3? ... Losing! A couple of hours after the game it occurred to me that White has a problem-like win after 20 f4!! (with the threat of h5). Black has no adequate defense. A] 20...d5 21 e5 f6 22 xf6 xf6 23 xf6! B] 20... d2+ 21 xd2 cxd2 22 c3!! xb3 23 xg7+! xg7 24 g4+ h8 25 d4+ and mates. C] 20...cxb2 21 h5! (threatening xg7+) 21... c3+ (if 21... f6 22 f5 h6 23 xh6+! gxh6 24 g6!! forces mate) 22 xb2 xd1+ (or
22... xf7 23 xf7 xd1+ 24 b1!! xd4 25 xh7+!! xh7 26 h5
mate) 23 c1 xf7 (forced) 24 xf7! (24 xf7?? g5+) and Black has no satisfactory answer to the threat of 25 xh7+ xh7 26 f5+ and mates. If 24... d7 25 xg7+ wins Black's Queen. 20 ... b7
21 f4 a4!!
I didn't see it! Moreover, the strength of this resource didn't become fully apparent to me for another two moves.
22 g4 ...
Also futile is 22 h6 f6 23 xf6 xb3. 22 ... f6! 23 xf6 xb3! At long last I saw the point of Geller's clever defense. As I was studying 24 f4, it suddenly dawned on me that 24... a2+ was curtains. So - White resigns After 24 cxb3 xf6! is the quietus. It is not enough to be a good player, observed Dr Tarrasch; you must also play well.
59 Kholmov [ U.S.S.R. ] - Fischer
SKOPJE 1967
KING'S INDIAN DEFENSE
The erring Bishop In order to restrain Black from creating complications, Kholmov employs an unpretentious system. But he posts his Bishop prematurely on a3, then penetrates ambitiously with 11 d6. Fischer, with the routine 11... a5, promptly refutes. It is instructive to observe how, from now on, he creates an unhealthy climate wherever the Bishop seeks lodging. His Queen returns to a3 on no less than three separate occasions, prompting one annotator to inquire, dryly, whether he was perhaps inventing perpetual motion. As early as move twelve it became apparent to both players that White was lost. However, Kholmov did his best to avert the inevitable for another twenty moves. Fischer (with White) had lost to Kholmov in their only previous encounter, played via telephone to Havana in '65. Here, Fischer's victory brought him first place, a half point ahead of Geller.
1 d4 f6
2 f3 g6
3 g3 g7
4 g2 O-O
5 O-O d6
6 c3 ...
A straightforward but essentially passive development. The idea is to avoid creating a weakness with c4; however, a drawback is White can no longer dominate the center with a Pawn-wedge. 6 ... bd7 More flexible than 6...d5 which I adopted against Ivkov at the Piatigorsky Cup, 1966. That game continued 7 e5 c6 8 e4 and now Black could have equalized easily with 8...dxe4 (instead of 8... e6?) 9 xe4 xe4 10 xe4 h3 (not 10...c5? 11 f3!) 11 e1 d7, etc.
7 b3 ...
A normal continuation, although it is dubious that White's Bishop is effective once posted on b2 or a3. This system is characterized by Pawn symmetry and quiet play with drawing tendencies. But a draw is precisely what I could not afford in this crucial encounter.
7 e4 e5 also presents Black with no opening problems.
7 ... e5 8 dxe5 ... Dissipating the central tension. Black has no trouble getting play after
8 e4 exd4 9 xd4 e8.
8 ... dxe5
9 e4 ...
"The turbulent complications of the normal K's Indian can hardly arise, and the position can already be evaluated as even." (TRIFUNOVICH). 9 ... e8
10 a3 ...
Better is 10 a4 a5 11 a3; whereupon the Bishop will be immune from eventual attack after... a5. "Even so early, White is on the wrong track. The Bishop has nothing to seek on the a3-f8 diagonal. Yet, while it is easy now to condemn this move, till now it has often been adopted by White with never a harsh word. The punishment which ensues, however... is more severe than any this commentator has observed hitherto. 10 b2 is correct." (TRIFUNOVICH). 10 ... c6 Black invites the Bishop to seize a strong position." (TRIFUNOVICH). 11 d6? ... Kholmov consumed over half an hour on this mistake. The idea is to keep Black bottled up while exerting pressure on the e-Pawn. The only trouble with the move, however, is that it loses. As Tarrasch wrote: "When you don't know what to do, wait for your opponent to get an idea - it's sure to be wrong!" 11 e2 was indicated. 11 ... a5! This normal freeing maneuver is now devastating.
12 d3 ...
What else? 12 b4 a3 leaves White in the same predicament. Black now has a shot which wins two pieces for a Rook; or, as it turns out, a lowly Pawn (which proves fatal). 12 ... e6! Springing the trap! White cannot avoid material loss. Geller, who was tied with me for the lead, had displayed great interest in my game - up to now. When he saw this position, he smiled wryly. I never noticed him looking at the game again.
13 b4 ...
No matter how White wriggles and squirms, he cannot escape the fate in store for him. After 13 e2 Black has the pleasant choice of either... xe4 or... e8 - both of which win a Pawn. After the game Kholmov told me he had originally intended 13 g5 xd6 14 xd6 xc3 15 e7 with active play. However, he saw (too late) that simply 14...h6! squelches all such illusions. 13 ... a3! Renewing the ancient threat of... xd6.
14 c7 ...
The wandering Bishop hopes to receive succor. But, in so doing, it must abandon protection of the b-pawn. 14 ... xb4 Perhaps White was hoping for 14... e8 15 a5 b6 16 ab1! bxa5 17 b3 c5! 18 bxc5 xc5 19 fb1 where Black's technical difficulties are great. 15 ab1 e7! A cute tactical point. 15... f8? loses the exchange after 16 g5 (if the Rook retreats, then White's Bishop returns to d6). Now 16 g5 is refuted by 16... c5. For all practical purposes the game is over. 16 fd1 e8
17 a5 ...
No rest for the weary. 17 ... d6
18 e2 xd1+
19 xd1 f8
20 d2 ...
Bad - as is everything else. 20 b4 f6 21 xf8 xf8 leaves White a Pawn behind with his weak squares still showing. 20 ... a3! Winning even more material.
21 c4 c5
22 f1 b5
23 d2 ...
23 b4 drops a piece to 23... d4.
23 ... a3! This curious shuttle has proved White's undoing.
24 b3 c5
25 xb5 ... Desperation. After 25 d8 e6! 26 a5 d6, Black wins as he pleases. 25 ... cxb5 26 xb5 a4 27 xc5 ... Perhaps White had intended 27 d5, but 27... xe4! spells finis. 27 ... xa5
28 d5 b8
29 a4 h3!
Quickest. 30 xe5 c8
31 d3 xa4
32 e1 a6
White resigns The Knight has no good square. If 33 d4 g7. Or 33 c3 c4. Finally, 33 a7 c7 34 a1 d7 35 xa6 xa7 36 xa7 xa7 37 xe8 a1 delivers the mate. Afterwards, Geller tried to offer my opponent some sympathy. I overheard a dismayed Kholmov telling him that I had "seen everything!" This game was particularly sweet because it was my first win against a Russian in almost a dozen tries (since game 52) - and my first with Black since 1962 (Korchnoi at Curaçao).
60 Fischer - Stein [ U.S.S.R. ]
INTERZONAL, SOUSSE 1967
RUY LOPEZ
When champions meet On his ninth turn Black varies the routine sparring but the game proceeds innocuously until Fischer veers with 14 b4, intensifying the struggle. If, in the ensuing slugfest, Stein can be said to have made an error, it is the strategic one of so pressing on the Q-side as to allow White to become entrenched on the opposite wing. Fischer's prosecution of the attack is crowned by a brilliant offer of a piece (29 xf5) which the Soviet champion declines. Had Fischer then renewed the sacrifice, the end would have come sooner. In his detailed notes Fischer refers to this oversight, reveals some important thoughts on the Ruy, pinpoints "the losing move" (21... b6), criticizes a second subtle mistake of his own (26 f3), and offers a possible defense for Stein (28... f6), which other commentators have failed to note. It is unfortunate that this interesting and most instructive game was expunged from the official records due to Fischer's withdrawal before having completed half his playing schedule.
1 e4 ...
I have never opened with the d-pawn - on principle. 1 ... e5 I had expected the Sicilian, with Stein's favorite accelerated Dragon (2...g6). I suspect that the Russians "group-think" before important games to decide which openings will upset their opponents psychologically.
2 f3 c6
3 b5 a6
Possibly Stein was braced for 4 xc6, as in game 56.
4 a4 ...
Relieving the suspense. 4 ... f6
5 O-O e7
6 e1 b5
7 b3 d6
In the event the reader is interested in what I may have had in mind against the Marshall Attack, he is referred to my game against Spassky at the Piatigorsky Cup, 1966, which continued: 7...O-O 8 c3 d5 9 exd5 xd5 10 xe5 xe5 11 xe5 c6 12 g3!? d6 13 e1 f6 14 d4 g4 15 d3 (15 f3 might be better) 15...c5 and now 16 c2! (instead of 16 dxc5?) allows Black insufficient compensation for his Pawn.
8 c3 O-O
9 h3 ...
For 9 d4 see game 36. 9 ... b7 A rare side line. 9... a5 10 c2 c5 is a better-known sequence. The text is somewhat passive and commits the Bishop perhaps prematurely. Usually Stein continues 9... d7 10 d4 f6; then 11 a4 is slightly better for White. The line chosen in the game comes to resemble Breyer's Defense (9... b8 10 d4 bd7 11 bd2 b7 12 c2! e8 13 b4 exd4 14 cxd4 a5 15 bxa5 c5) - see note to White's 17th move.
10 d4 a5
Believe it or not, this Knight is headed for d7! Black may prefer the shorter route with 10... b8; but experience has shown that after 11 dxe5 dxe5 12 xd8, Black is obliged to recapture with his Bishop, which interferes with his development and produces endgame difficulties.
11 c2 c4
Unsound is 11...exd4 12 cxd4 d5 13 e5 e4 14 c3 f5 15 exf6 e.p. xf6 16 xe4 dxe4 17 xe4 xe4 18 xe4 c5 19 d5 and Black remains a Pawn down. Another possibility is 11...exd4 12 cxd4 c5 but White holds the edge with 13 bd2. On 11...c5 immediately, White replies 12 bd2, retaining the option of d5, locking in Black's Bishop on b7.
12 b3 b6
13 bd2 ... Not 13 dxe5 dxe5 14 xd8 axd8 15 xe5 xe4!=. 13 ... bd7 Black's 5th move with this Knight! 13...exd4 14 cxd4 c5 seems more active. Stein-Lutikov, Moscow 1966 continued 13... e8? 14 f1? and Black equalized easily. However, White should vary with 14 dxe5 dxe5 15 xe5 d6 16 ef3 xe4 (16... xe4 17 xe4 xe4 18 g5! busts Black) 17 xe4 xe4 18 d3! (White can't win a piece because his Queen hangs at the end after... h2+), with initiative. 14 b4! ... Prevents...c5 and prepares a dominating build-up with 15 b2 followed by c4. The routine continuation 14 b2 (Keres-Gligorich, Zurich 1959) gives nothing. 14 ... exd4 Stein makes his bid for active counterplay even though it involves abandoning his "strong point" (e5-Pawn). If 14...a5 15 b3! and Black might find himself in straightened circumstances after the Knight reaches a5. 15 cxd4 a5 On 15...c5 16 bxc5 dxc5 17 d5 White's steamroller in the center is more formidable than Black's Q-side majority. 16 bxa5 c5 Inferior would be 16... xa5 17 d5! c5 18 dxc6 e.p. xc6 19 d4, after which White, among other things, goes to work on the isolated b-Pawn. 17 e5! ... This identical position was reached by transposition, with Black's Rook on e8, in Cirich-Robatsch, Beverwijk 1967, which continued: 17 b2 xa5 18 a4 b4 19 c4 c7 20 e5 dxe5 21 dxe5 d5 22 fd2 7b6 and now Spassky's recommendation of 23 e6! is unpleasant for Black. (See note to Black's 9th move.) 17 ... dxe5 Another line of defense is 17... e8 with the idea of eliminating both of White's center Pawns. "The consequences are very ramified, and there is some danger that Black may fail to recover White's Pawn on its a5 or may lose his own on b5, or both. The text is more active but also more dangerous for Black's King." (KMOCH). 18 dxe5 d5
19 e4 b4!
The idea is to force the Bishop to retreat and thereby hem in White's QR. On 19... xa5 20 eg5! h6 21 d3! g6 22 e6! wins.
20 b1 xa5
21 e2! ... Increasing the pressure. Not 21 e6 fxe6 22 eg5? (or 22 fg5 d5 23 xh7 f5! holds) 22... xf3! 23 xf3 f6 wins. One can sense the storm looming against Black's King. 21 ... b6? Quite possibly "the losing move." It is better to reserve this Knight for the defense of the K-side. More prudent is 21... e8! with... f8 in the offing. 22 d1 c7 leads to nought. And 22 e6 leads to no demonstrable advantage after 22...fxe6 23 eg5 xg5 24 xg5 f8 25 h5 g6, etc. 22 fg5! ... Now the threats are beginning to jell. 22 ... xe4! Forced, because if 22...h6 23 h7!! stands Black up. On 23... e8 (23... xh7 24 xc5 dis.+ followed by xb7 leads to a small fork) 24 hf6+! xf6 (24...gxf6 25 g4+ h8 26 d6! xd6 27 f5! g7 28 xh6+ leads to mate) 25 xf6+ xf6 (again if 25...gxf6 26 g4+ f8 27 xh6+ e7 28 e6! d6 29 g3+ c6 30 e4+ 4d5 31 exf7 h8 32 xd5+ wins) 26 exf6 wins the exchange. Also insufficient is 22...g6 23 e6! f5 24 f7! followed by b2 with a crushing attack. 23 xe4 g6
24 h4 h5
25 g3! ... Now White threatens 26 e6! h4! 27 xd8 xg3 28 b7 a7 29 xc5. After Black's next move, this variation fails against 29... xe5. Impetuous would be 25 g4?? d4. 25 ... c4! 26 f3? ... More forcing is 26 e6! f5 27 f3 (not 27 f7 xf7! 28 exf7+ xf7 29 xf5! gxf5 30 f3 g6 31 g4 d5 and a draw appears likely) 27... g7
28 f4 h8 transposing into the game (but not 27... f6 28 g5 h7 29
xf6 xf6 30 xf5! gxf5 31 ad1 d5 32 e7! xe7 33 xd5 is decisive.). This order of moves would prohibit the defense mentioned in the note to Black's 28th; after being forced to play 26...f5, Black loses his options. At this stage the power failed. In the dark I began to worry about 26... d3! (if 27 d1 xc1! and White has nothing). Then the lights came on again and I saw clearly that 26... d3? was crushed by 27 xd3! xd3 28 g5! and White penetrates decisively on the weak dark squares. 26 ... g7
27 f4 h8
28 e6! ... "This blow rocks the remnants of the tower around the Black King."
(GLIGORICH).
28 ... f5 Much stiffer resistance (taking advantage of White's inaccurate 26th move) is offered by 28... f6! (not 28...f6 29 h4) 29 exf7 xa1 (29... d6? 30 f8= +! xf8 31 e4 d7 32 g5! a6 33 xf6 xf6 34 e5! winning a Pawn and eventually the game) 30 f8= +! xf8 31 c7+ g8 32 xg6 d5 (if 32... a6 33 e8!) 33 b7 f6 34 f4 (threatening 35 g5 and f7+) 34... h7! White now appears to have nothing better than 35 xh7+ xh7 36 d5+ f7 (worse is 36... h8? 37 xh5!) 37 xf7+ xf7 38 xa1 with chances by virtue of the extra Pawn. But this would be a tough ending to win! 29 xf5! f8 The only reasonable way to decline the sacrifice. On 29... d6 30 e7! xf4 (or 30... xe7 31 g3 a6 32 g5, etc.) 31 exd8= xd8 32 xf4 gxf5 33 c7! (R.Byrne). Kmoch suggests that "Leonidas might even have better taken a chance and faced the storm by playing 29...gxf5." But the Bishop is tabu, for White wins quickly with 30 g3+. Black now has two defenses which fail: A] 30... f8 31 g6 e8 (if 31... d6 32 e5!) 32 h6+ xh6 33 xh6+ g8 34 g5. B] 30... h7 31 g5+! xg5 32 xg5 d3 (if 32... b8 33 h4! g6
34 f6 - or 32... e8 33 ad1 a7 34 d8! xd8 35 xd8 xd8 36 e7
e8 37 e6! exe7 38 g6+ h8 39 f6+ g7 40 h6+ and mates) 33 c7+ g6 34 f7+! xg5 35 g7+ f4 36 ad1!, etc. 30 e4? ... Littlewood indicates 30 h4! as a quick win for White. He's right. The main line is 30... xh4 31 xh4 xf5 (if 31... f6 32 g3! - or 31...gxf5 32 g5+ h7 33 e7 e8 34 e6!) 32 e7+ g8 33 d8+ g7 34 c7+ g8 35 e7, etc. 30 ... xf4 31 xf4 e8? Stein's post-mortem suggestion of 31... a6 is met by 32 ad1 xe6 33 d7 (threatening g5), etc. But the best try is 31... xa2! On 32 ad1 a7 holds. And if 32 xa2 xa2 33 e5 g5 34 g3 maintains the initiative, but Black has drawing chances. Black, however, was in extreme time-pressure. 32 ad1 a6
33 d7 ...
Even more convincing is 33 b7! a7 34 d7. 33 ... xe6
34 g5 f6
Costs the exchange. But no better is 34... a6 35 b1 f6 36 e4+ f7 37 xc5, etc. 35 f3! xf4 Of course 35... f8 is refuted by 36 h7+. 36 e6+ f6 37 xf4 e5
38 b7 d6
39 f1 ...
Puts an end to all effective resistance. White's material superiority must tell. 39 ... c2 A pretty point is revealed after 39... xf3 40 xe8 d2+ 41 e2 xf4 42 f8+ g5 43 xf4 xf4 44 xd2, resigns.
40 e4 d4
41 b6 d8
42 d5+ f5 43 e3+ ... The sealed move seals Black's fate. Not only is White an exchange ahead, but his attack still rages. 43 ... e6 Equally hopeless is 43... f6 44 e2 b4 45 f4 followed by c4. 44 e2! ... "The double threat of 45 f4 and 45 xb5 clears the last stone from the road to victory." (KMOCH). 44 ... d7 45 xb5+ xb5 46 xb5 c6
